<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about a news story involving a drunk woman groping a flight attendant, sparking crude jokes and speculation about the flight attendant's sexual orientation. This transitioned into a running gag about awkward elevator encounters with colleagues, particularly a despised coworker named Gary.  The hosts recounted past grievances and used offensive language to describe their colleagues,  interspersing this with tangents about a news anchor's speech impediment, a locker room video featuring a large penis (which they unsuccessfully searched for online), Bill O'Reilly's book, Herman Cain, and the Occupy movement.  No guests were present during this segment.

The show continued with a segment focused on workplace grievances, particularly the lack of Christmas bonuses and a condescending company email.  Opie, Anthony, and several studio guests (unnamed) unleashed a torrent of offensive insults directed at various individuals, including a former colleague, Scott Farrell,  accused of betraying them to curry favor with Howard Stern, and another coworker called "the Australian fuck."  The conversation drifted through recollections of past radio experiences, including an on-air guest's ex-wife advertising a yard sale of his belongings; a caller's $100 Christmas bonus (compared to lavish Oprah Winfrey visits and a $25,000 bonus received by a callerâ€™s wife in HR);  a past $10 million lawsuit; anecdotes about Scott Muni; and a debate over George Harrison's best songs.  Audio of a Herman Cain interview was played, further discussing sexual harassment allegations. The segment ended with a reiteration of their dislike for certain individuals and promotion of upcoming live shows.

Next, the show tackled the developing Herman Cain scandal, graphically detailing his affair with Ginger White and the media's coverage, including a humorous retelling of a phone call where Cain unwittingly confirmed the affair.  The hosts also mocked a video of an Occupy Toronto protestor reacting to the destruction of a "people's library," and discussed the Jerry Sandusky and Bernie Fine child sexual abuse scandals, playing an audio recording of Bernie Fine's wife discussing the allegations with shocking candor. They previewed an upcoming online show featuring "The Warrior," a profane motivational speaker coaching the band Asking Alexandria, showing a clip of his training methods. Finally, they speculated about a possibly photoshopped picture of wrestler Virgil.  Again, no studio guests were present.

The show then moved to a segment focused on the absence of their scheduled guest, Jordan, a karaoke singer, who was on hold for hours trying to reach them. They then attempted to reach Ultimate Warrior by phone, leading to a bizarre one-sided conversation.  The bulk of the segment centered on Jordan's increasingly implausible and contradictory story about being mugged in the Opie and Anthony studio lobby, eventually revealing his attempt to get on the air.  A police officer was even called to discuss the possibility of a false police report.

Following Jordan's segment, actor Gary Oldman was interviewed. The conversation covered his career, sobriety, family, and extensively discussed his film "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," praising the director and the film's production.  The hosts expressed their admiration for Oldman's acting.

The final segment started with a continuation of the Gary Oldman interview, focusing on his acting process and referencing Sanford Meisner's teachings.  After the interview, the hosts discussed their success in getting Oldman as a guest and speculated about a future guest, a friend of Oldman's (identity withheld).  They then shared opinions on other actors (Ben Affleck, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio), interspersed with a comedic tangent about their mothers' baking skills. They announced John Walsh as their next guest, discussing his work on *America's Most Wanted*, his son's murder, and his views on the criminal justice system. A live read for Argentium silver jewelry preceded Walsh's interview.  The show concluded with post-interview discussion amongst the hosts, reflecting on their interviews with Gary Oldman and John Walsh.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Exactly.  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony channel, XM 105, Sirius 206. 
[00:03:30]  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the O.P.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show with O.P.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:04:00]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Palavericious. 
[00:04:30]  Yes.  Good morning.  Palavalicious.  Hi, everyone.  Morning, morning, morning, morning.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  I'm trying to find out.  You know, we're preparing for the show and what's not.  What's not.  And one of the stories today, and I don't know anything about it because I just see the  headline here and now I'm trying to find it.  Woman who groped flight steward thought it was her boyfriend.  How do we even know that?  That means the guy complained that some woman was groping him? 
[00:05:00]  Well, if it's a flight steward, I could see that happening.  They traditionally don't like being groped by women.  Oh.  You know?  Oh.  You know the flight steward story?  A little bit of it.  All right.  Because I can't find it yet.  Yeah, you got it in your pile there.  But apparently this happened a few months ago.  Some drunken 25-year-old teacher was on a flight and apparently got so wasted that the  story goes that she, the official story, is that she thought the flight attendant was 
[00:05:30]  her boyfriend.  All right.  So she started grabbing at his crotch and telling him that he could touch her everywhere.  Nice.  Yeah, that's her right there.  Catherine Goldberg.  Yeah, she is pretty cute.  She's not bad.  So why did the guy complain?  Is he a gay guy?  Of course.  Well, I could only imagine that would be the only reason.  So gay guys complain?  Flight stewards are-  I would assume gay guys want to be touched and groped by women, too.  No.  How would you like if a guy was grabbing you?  Because women are so awesome. 
[00:06:00]  That's the same thing.  I just assume women are so awesome if you're gay.  You wouldn't tell the police?  Right?  No.  Stupid of me to think that women are so awesome that even gay guys wouldn't mind fucking having  their cocks grabbed.  You would think.  Is she a limey?  I don't know.  She was on a flight that was headed to South Africa.  I think she was going to like Johannesburg or something.  But she's drunk and she's just-  Have her clit removed?  She's playing grab-  Grab-ass.  Yeah.  It says, let's see, she made a sexual suggestion to a flight attendant trying to look after 
[00:06:30]  her because she was so drunk.  And, quote, at one point sat on his lap and grabbed hold of his genitals through his trousers.  That's great.  That's awesome.  What a great chick.  What a great flight.  I hope she gets like fucking frequent flyer miles out of it or her status gets upgraded.  Oh, boy.  Well.  So you got to assume the guy was gay.  Yeah, you got to assume.  Because even if it's a straight guy and he's not going to play around or whatever, you're  not going to run to the media and feel like you were violated.  I don't think I've ever seen a heterosexual flight attendant. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, it's a little rough, huh?  I really don't.  And they're bitchy.  Guys are usually the gay.  The ones I've seen are dicks.  The ones that are straight guys are kind of like fucking have something to prove.  Like they're real alpha type guys.  Well, if you have something to prove, get off the fucking airplane and go do something else.  It's like a male nurse, though, those guys.  It's like you take a traditionally female job for years and years and then you step into  it and they, you know, oh, I want to be able to do this. 
[00:07:30]  And then you do it.  It's like, look, that's a great picture of a prime example of a flight attendant.  It might have gotten more masculine since security became a concern.  Like you want somebody who's...  Like I like when I see guys as flight attendants.  A burly...  You're like a burly man.  Fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, I want a guy whose muscles I can see rippling when he hands me my crackers.  That guy looks familiar.  I think...  I've seen him on a flight.  I think Rich Voss tweeted recently that these flight attendants, too, they're just all assholes  now.  Do you know that, Jimmy? 
[00:08:00]  Because you've been flying a hell of a lot more than me.  I've noticed that they're fairly bad on Continental.  The customer service has been terrible.  What's their problem?  I don't know.  They know that...  I think that they know you're in a position...  They're untouchable.  They're untouchable.  You can't fucking even argue with them anymore without the threat of getting pulled off  the flight.  Well, you don't want to argue with them.  You want your drink and your stupid, cheap fucking meal.  I swear that guy looks familiar.  You're kidding.  That's the guy that...  That's the guy that quit famously. 
[00:08:30]  That drank the beer and...  Oh, okay.  No wonder.  And popped the shoe.  I thought I saw him on a flight.  No.  Probably saw him in a fucking daisy chain somewhere.  The other side of a glory hole peeking through.  Hello.  What was his story again?  He quit by drinking a beer and then he pulled the chute, right?  Sled down the emergency chute.  Yeah.  That guy.  Jumped in his jeep and drove home.  You know what?  Fucking love that guy.  Yeah, but didn't they make him pay for the cost of the door?  Yeah, but he got a book out of it.  Did he really?  Yeah, he's way ahead.  What's the name of the book? 
[00:09:00]  He's way ahead.  The Sly.  More than just The Sly.  I forgot it was More Than Just, right?  That stupid catch book.  Oh, I hate that thing.  God.  Thank God we didn't interview them.  That guy.  He wasn't bad.  David Tyewee, was it?  You interviewed him.  That's right.  God's not on his side, man.  No.  God tricked him.  God tricked him.  Sam and E-Rock.  Sam and E-Rock got to interview him.  Yeah, I think he has a book.  Grabs beer, activates Sly to make escape. 
[00:09:30]  That guy.  All right.  So, yeah, I saw that woman who groped Flight Stewart thought it was her boyfriend.  And I'm just amazed that we know that.  Yeah, they're calling it an alcohol-induced illusion.  Illusion.  I love all that legalese.  I wish I could get away with shit like that.  Just grabbing titties and just call it an alcohol-induced illusion.  Illusion.  I thought it was my chick.  That's nice.  We don't know anything about the guy?  We're just assuming he has to be gay, right? 
[00:10:00]  No.  This is the only...  I mean, there's a few different stories about it, but it's only back in the news again because  I think the sentencing came down for her, because this story is a few months old.  But from what I read, all I know is that she was somehow imagining this was her boyfriend  with whom she was interacting.  They make no reference as to whether or not the sexual orientation of the flight is in.  But I've got to imagine that on a flight, if this girl is so drunken that she needs  flight attendants to look after her and take care of her, I'm sure she's disturbing other 
[00:10:30]  people on the plane, and this guy probably didn't have a choice but to report the situation.  She's pretty pixie-looking.  Well, yeah, she's kind of cute.  She's not a slob.  I think most guys would let the slob grab those cheeks.  She's got those chipmunk cheeks.  Oh, no, no, it's too early, too early, too early.  Too early for that.  It's too early for that.  Oh, God, that's great.  Who won the football last night?  I went to bed early.  Giants lost again, I guess, huh?  Yeah, they got blown away.  Giants fucking suck. 
[00:11:00]  That's three in a row they lost.  Once again, falling apart.  Giants fall apart second half of the season.  Yeah.  What the hell's going on with these guys?  I know the Saints are a tough team, but fuck.  And Philly lost too, right?  Eagles.  My Cowboy's in sole position.  Yeah, Eagles got their ass kicked, too.  That was a couple days ago now, though.  Sundar.  Yep.  You hear about Mike Francesa?  No.  Yeah, apparently not the one that calls this show.  No. 
[00:11:30]  Is that the same guy?  He slipped.  But equally as filthy.  He slipped.  Huh?  He slipped.  Yeah, it's an easy slip to me.  It is an easy slip.  It is still fun, though, man, to hear the word cunt on the radio.  So, regular radio.  Yeah.  Do we have the tax cunts?  Tax cunts.  The greatest slip of the tongue ever?  Yeah.  You're wrong.  Yeah.  The key component in what the president insists is a job stimulus program.  Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically. 
[00:12:00]  And his NBC David Gregory reports tonight.  The president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced  the tax cunts are the answer.  Well, I don't think tax cunts are the answer, to tell you the truth.  We all know he had a tough time talking when he was doing the news, but he also just ran  out of air.  Tax cunts.  You can see he's running out of air.  He does.  It must be hard to talk like that.  Have that ability.  What's wrong with his mouth? 
[00:12:30]  I don't know.  It's a certain type of lisp.  Yeah.  That people just don't get over.  It's that little thing.  Their L's are in the back of their throat instead of where the tongue meets the front of the teeth.  And you end up like this.  So what is he trying to keep his tongue down in the back?  Oh, oh, oh.  I don't know.  That is weird.  You can't just go, oh.  Because an L is, you know, you jam your tip of your tongue into the back of your upper  teeth.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:13:00]  How do you know that?  Oh.  I just do it.  Yeah, you just do it.  I just do it.  How do you know that, though?  Oh, oh, oh.  But he goes like, like, like.  So just lift your stupid tongue up.  Oh, oh, oh.  I know.  Think he has a small tongue?  What the hell?  He's got a small tongue.  Maybe his little.  Horrible cunnilingus.  Yeah, maybe his little itsy butsy tongue doesn't reach.  Come here, sweetheart.  Let me get a piece of that clitoris.  He has to open his mouth around the clit and then, like, push her ass up into his palate.  I hope you'll like this. 
[00:13:30]  I am not very proficient at cunnilingus.  Cunnilingus.  Eating pussy.  You think the tongue's just too short and it can't hit those teeth?  His tongue is too short.  That's great.  The poor guy.  Oh, no.  I bet he's got dry teeth, too.  Can't lick them.  I put crust on the outside of my teeth so my breath is fresh.  Oh, Jesus.  It's got to be a horrible film.  I have such a problem licking assholes, too, especially the deep ones. 
[00:14:00]  I can barely penetrate.  The old brown eye.  Very difficult to get in there.  Tongue that bung.  His little tongue.  Yeah, I don't know why people can't just fucking, like, lisps are the weirdest thing to me.  Well, and it's like, don't, just don't do that.  And it's fine to have a lisp, but he was on TV when we only had three channels.  Yeah.  That was the best guy?  That was it.  To read our news?  Yeah.  He wasn't doing anything special.  Sorry to all the Tom Brokaw fans out there, but the guy was just reading news like everyone 
[00:14:30]  else.  He had that journalistic integrity.  No, he did.  I think it was the last of the anchors that had journalistic integrity.  Yeah, but they still just read you the news.  No, he actually, he was brought up in that day and age of, like, Mike Wallace and everybody  that actually went out and got the stories in their youth, went to, like, war zones and  did things.  Not just these guys that read teleprompters or something, but the fact that he couldn't  speak is really fucked up. 
[00:15:00]  Don't bullshit me with your small coffee.  Look, small coffee fits into a large coffee.  No, it doesn't.  You had some in there.  I'm not falling for this again.  You sure?  No, not today.  It's an inside bit.  Sorry.  It's nothing to anyone.  What do you mean, integrity?  Having trouble getting past the labia.  What do you mean by integrity?  He would go out and get his own story?  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, do his own reporting, write his own shit. 
[00:15:30]  He'd be in a hotel with a little typewriter in some faraway land.  He didn't editorialize too much.  No.  No, but, you know, he wrote his own shit back in, you know, the day.  Speaking of cunts.  Tax cunts.  This Bill O'Reilly, man.  You don't like Bill?  God damn it.  I told you before the show, too.  Like, even if he's saying something I would possibly agree with, he's such a cunt.  Yeah.  He's just a pompous asshole.  A smug douchebag. 
[00:16:00]  He's shmummy, dude.  You know what, dude?  He thinks he's really, you know, he knows his shit don't stink, dude.  He's got the shmummy attitude.  Shmummy.  Yeah, don't fuck yourself.  You gotta say something, just say it.  What?  He's so unlikable, but he's got...  Bobby.  Yeah.  And Bobby.  And he's got the biggest audience as far as that news shit goes.  Yep.  I watched him for the first time last night in a while.  I flip around and...  Holy fuck, he's an asshole. 
[00:16:30]  Didn't change your opinion of him?  No.  He comes across like he knows literally way more than anyone else.  He does like...  Including the President of the United States.  I know you're not a big Obama fan.  No, I'm not.  But he fucking just...  He believes he knows more than everyone alive.  Maybe he does.  Fuck no.  He's smart.  Bill O'Reilly's the smartest man in town.  He's an asshole.  He's got a book out about Lincoln's assassination or something.  And I hear they won't even put it in the... 
[00:17:00]  In...  What's the...  Ford's Theater.  Ford's Theater in Washington where Lincoln was assassinated.  They have like a gift shop there or some shit.  And they sell Lincoln stuff.  Right.  And he tried to have his book put in there.  And even they're saying,  Oh, we don't quite agree with everything in there.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah, they think he might have embellished a few things.  Well, what is he saying differently?  Does anyone know?  That he fell off the balcony.  Hit his head.  And how the fuck would Bill O'Reilly know?  I don't know.  That's 130...  18... 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  68?  I forgot the year now.  1860-something.  68?  60-something.  It was right after the war, right?  65?  68.  I'm going 68.  I think it was 65.  I'm going 68.  I'm saying 65.  Fuck.  You're going to be right on this one.  Was it 65?  I'm going to go 68.  I would ask Siri.  I think he bled until...  I don't give a shit.  He bled until 1868.  So we might both be right on this one.  You ever go to the 4th Theater in the middle of the ghetto?  Is it in the middle of the ghetto?  Oh, oh, oh.  What state is that in?  People still getting shot over there. 
[00:18:00]  Down there in D.C.  Oh.  D.C.  The District of Columbia.  The war ended in 65.  Yeah.  I thought he was like the last casualty of this little war.  He died in...  68.  Thank you.  The answer is 65.  I'm sorry, Opie.  The answer is 65.  I knew it wasn't long after the war ended.  But he did bleed until 68.  Yes.  He was right.  He did.  On that nasty pillow.  Yeah.  He let his slow, slow death.  Sam's on the mic, so I do want to ask him.  I did ask him off air.  Why are you bringing me stuff I know about? 
[00:18:30]  This is all stuff I know about.  You're supposed to know about it.  Those CDs.  Like Herman Cain's accuser.  I know about this.  I'm giving you information to share with the listeners.  You're not bringing anything new to Opie.  I know all this stuff.  I'm not supposed to be informing you of things.  You're supposed to be informed.  It's old hat.  But why are you bringing me stuff I just know about already?  So that way you can inform the listeners of it.  And I can give you...  They all know about this stuff.  Well, that way you can make jokes about it then, maybe.  I just care about the audio from The Ultimate Warrior. 
[00:19:00]  I want to hear that.  It's there.  About his new show.  Nice.  And Crying Occupy guy about the library.  Oh, that's a...  Oh, you got that?  We got to get that.  I'll find it.  That fucking fag.  Wait, is it the Toronto guy?  Is it?  Yeah, yeah.  That's him.  I know about this too, Sam.  I'm a crybaby.  Well, that way you can share.  We all know about this.  You guys can share what you like with the listeners.  That guy...  I saw the video.  Someone tweeted it last night.  And I watched it about three times.  And just thought of people in Cairo watching their friends' heads explode. 
[00:19:30]  And getting brains on their shoulder.  And dragging their dead pals off the street.  And this kid's crying because they shut down his dumb library.  And then...  Where I'm at with this, this is what makes it tough for me to get behind this shit.  You know what...  And look, Steve-O's in the furry hat crying behind him.  Oh my god, that does look like Steve-O.  If me and you were circles, you know how part of our circles would touch.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm in agreement with you here. 
[00:20:00]  Yep.  You're way over here, though.  Like, fuck all of them.  I know.  And I'm like, fuck, get rid of these idiots and maybe this could become something.  This is so done.  This Occupy thing is done.  It's over.  They gotta move on to something else.  No?  It's not.  I think it is, Chipster.  Chippa.  Oh, okay.  You want the answer to the Lincoln thing that's in Bill O'Reilly's book?  Ah, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Let's talk to Jeff in Massachusetts.  Hey, Jeff.  How are you?  Hi, Jeffy.  The book has a lot of historical inaccuracies.  Like, he makes references to the Oval Office, and that wasn't even built during Lincoln's presidency.  And there's a few other ones, and he just didn't do a good job fact-finding.  And I think he had a couple other guys help him like the book, so that's why it's not  going to be put in, like, the gift shops and all that crap.  Yeah.  Isn't that what I said?  Yeah, but then we got a guy named Dan in New Hampshire saying that it is in the gift shop. 
[00:21:00]  Really?  I heard it wasn't.  I'm going to go with you over Dan, because I don't know Dan.  Yeah, go ahead.  He put on another book, Factor Words.  He's just an asshole.  First of all, it's by Bill O'Reilly and the O'Reilly Factor staff, which means he had nothing  to do with it.  Interns wrote it.  And it's literally just a list.  It's a book full of words that he's used as vocabulary words.  Oh, cool.  On the factor. 
[00:21:30]  What do you mean?  Are they real words?  Yeah, like, truculent, eager to fight, pugnacious.  Truculent?  That means that you've got to get your truck back from someone.  No, it doesn't.  It's like the best of the dictionary.  Truculent.  You're terrible.  He's putting out a dictionary with his name on it?  No, like a best of.  Yeah, pretty much.  Pretty much.  The best of a dictionary.  Right, it's the best of.  What's the next one?  Chuffiness.  Rough or surly behavior.  Surly. 
[00:22:00]  Bulketeer.  A person who overlooks.  That's like right above the balcony.  No, it's not.  It's a person who overlooks meritorious behavior.  What a pompous idiot.  And you lose to Dan Libby from New Hampshire.  What happened?  He's now linking the source that says that the book is being sold.  Oh, no.  Is being sold.  Oh, linking.  You've never gone.  Abraham linking.  You've never gone to the Ford Theater? 
[00:22:30]  You would love that shit.  You love history.  I know.  Especially Civil War history.  And what I remember is the area wasn't that nice.  No?  It was a little creepy.  Or maybe it wasn't nice back then either if the president's being shot.  Well, it's a walking city.  So I think I walked there.  So maybe the walk was worse than the actual area it was in.  Now I'm trying to remember.  Yeah.  I remember it was a little shady, though.  I would wear a stovepipe hat and walk around like Lincoln.  Lincoln.  With that stupid L in his name. 
[00:23:00]  It always threw me as a kid.  Anyway, so Mike Francesa.  Yes.  The C word got out on his broadcast yesterday.  Ooh.  Nothing exciting to talk about in that game.  Titans over the Buccaneers.  They stay in the wild card hunt.  Finally had a good game rushing.  He had 23 for 190.  Wild hard cunt.  And then you hear dead air because then his engineer was trying to save his ass.  Trying to dump. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  He's not going to get in trouble for that.  Because they probably.  I bet a lot of time went by before he hit the dump.  Oh, sure.  Like, it was like, is that, should I, should I, ah, better.  Yeah.  And he missed it.  And this is the real Mike Francesa, not the guy that calls our show.  But you could hear it's the same, it's the same voice pretty much.  Yeah.  Nothing exciting to talk about in that game.  Titans over the Buccaneers.  They stay in the wild hard cunt, in the wild card hunt.  Finally had a good game rushing.  He had 23 for 190. 
[00:24:00]  It's hilarious.  And there is something to talk about in that game.  Isn't that the game where the black cock made the TV?  Oh my gosh.  The black cock.  Did you see that?  No.  Oh, it's fucking hilarious.  And the guy had to apologize.  But if you're going to have a camera in the locker room, fuck, you know, you got to pay attention.  Yeah.  They're interviewing somebody.  Is it coming through a hole?  The second glory hole joke of the day.  You never have enough.  No.  They're interviewing somebody and behind him is a big black cat. 
[00:24:30]  Damn, that's what you don't want it.  I don't, you have it there, uh, Sam?  Oh, Sam's just fucking...  Maybe I have it.  He's just diddling the keyboard to no avail.  Let me see.  2008, another penis in locker room story.  Huh?  Figure that one out.  Penises.  In locker rooms.  Huh?  Uh.  Uh, where is it?  TV station. 
[00:25:00]  Uh.  Oh, come on.  Copywritten.  I thought I tweeted yesterday.  Maybe I didn't.  Who's got it?  Who's got this shit?  His video was just taken offline.  No, this guy, uh, it's being taken offline everywhere, but this guy made his own little  fucking thing.  His thing.  He made a little thing.  I thought I had it yesterday.  I don't know.  Someone else have it?  It's classic, though.  Big black cock in the background.  Was it big?  Was it swinging? 
[00:25:30]  Well, if it's bigger than your own, you would have to say it's big.  That's true.  Bigger than mine.  Yeah.  And the woman, uh...  Soft?  Uh, yeah.  Wow.  Swinging soft.  Yeah.  Yeah, swinging fucking soft.  That's impressive.  You know this thing could do some fucking damage.  It's impressive, especially with the pressure of knowing that a camera's on it.  Is that it?  Ha ha ha.  Come on.  What happened?  I didn't see it.  What happened?  God damn it.  I had it yesterday. 
[00:26:00]  I thought I fucking...  Where's that big black cock?  What happened?  Ha ha ha ha.  How would get that cock up?  Oh, Sam.  Well, Eric sent me this one.  Eric sent you that?  I didn't see a penis.  No, he covered it.  It's at the very beginning, right as the Fox logo moves away.  Where?  Oh, I see a little.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  That is huge, though.  Now, that's not the video I saw.  And what is that bald guy looking at?  Is he looking at his cock?  He's looking right at it.  He's probably staring right at that big cock.  He probably sees his hand out there.  God damn it, that kick. 
[00:26:30]  The head of his dick is closer to his knee than it is to his fucking balls.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  He probably sees that big cock out there.  How does he not just scrab it?  What?  Just hold it and go like, look, look, look, look.  Shake it all about.  That's perpetuating the stereotype.  Yeah.  He just grabs that cock.  Squeezes it angrily.  Big snake.  Is that the clip, though?  Because all it does is come back from the logo. 
[00:27:00]  Unless you freeze frame it, you can't even see it.  I'm really frustrated because I did have it.  I thought I tweeted last night.  I don't see it on my timeline.  I don't know what.  Is it a completely different clip?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's a close-up of a guy being interviewed and the whole left side of the screen is this  big tack for about five seconds.  It's really funny.  We apologize for the cock.  But it's really hard to find.  But this one guy captured it before everyone started getting rid of it and made a little  flash video.  It's a little flash. 
[00:27:30]  And no one is fucking tweeting me with this shit.  Fucking tweet me, you assholes.  What are you waiting for?  Tweet.  This might be it.  How did that get into our vernacular?  Stupid tweet.  Well, we have to say tweet all the time.  How often did you say tweet before Twitter?  Well, every time I saw a bird.  Bird.  Yeah.  Not that.  You just look at it.  All right.  Here we go.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  You're yelling a bird in a tree.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, that's it.  Bobby in CT on Twitter. 
[00:28:00]  Go to his Twitter.  He's got it.  He just tweeted it.  Thank you.  That's how you get followers, motherfucker.  Bobby in CT.  You should get a lot of followers today.  All right.  Here it is.  Let's see.  It's just.  Uh-oh.  What does it say?  Oh, Bobby just got a free plug.  I just have it.  I have it.  Oh, you found it.  Oh, look at this, though.  Bobby fucking sends this to me, and it says, this video contains content from Fox, who  has blocked it on copyright grounds.  Whoops.  So don't follow Bobby.  Hey, Sam, you want to maybe tip the monitor up a little bit?  Oh, he's the worst, isn't he? 
[00:28:30]  And turn it maybe a little.  It's pointing at the ground, Sam.  Sam only cares.  The two of us have to be able to see it.  No.  And I have to see it, too.  And he only cares about his own monitor enjoyment.  I know.  God, Sam.  You're not in the living room watching TV.  Turn it.  Terrible.  Place of business.  By the way, Deadspin has it.  Deadspin's a pretty good website.  I kind of enjoy it a little bit.  All right, here we go.  All right, let's see.  Better explaining why we didn't get the measurement down at the end.  But, you know, as always, that's the story of our season so far. 
[00:29:00]  That guy's got to crack.  He has to know.  Yeah, come on.  Of course.  They're probably fucking around with everyone.  Let it rip.  See how long it goes.  Let's see how long that Cox's on TV.  You know, you don't blame them on the rest, but, man, they got a big part.  Do you think that was a part?  That's right.  That they had gotten the measurement.  Man, it looked like at least a measurement.  Man, a measurement, you know, at least a letter's getting everything going.  I mean.  He put his shorts on.  That's fucking hilarious.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  I love that shit. 
[00:29:30]  Fuck, it's hilarious.  Snuffleupagus hanging there, mate.  It's just big.  What?  Damn.  It's a dark.  The guys don't comment on it or anything?  No.  Everyone makes believe this shit doesn't happen.  I don't understand that.  You got to say something like, holy crap.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Wish I had a cock like that.  Says Tampa Bay Fox affiliate airs unidentified buccaneer locker room dong.  That's the headline.  Dong.  I thought it was dong.  I think that's funnier than Pud. 
[00:30:00]  Pud is old school.  Pud is like just a shitty white dick.  A dong is, I guess, a black dick, right?  Yeah.  You Pud.  Yeah, I don't think Pud is flattering when you say that.  Suck my Pud toots.  No chick wants to hear that.  No.  Oh, that's great.  Go to Deadspin.  They still have it.  I mean, they're trying to get rid of that fucking video.  They don't want anyone to see it.  Oh, yeah.  But it's funny.  Once again, Mike Francesa.  Nothing exciting to talk about in that game.  Titans over the Buccaneers. 
[00:30:30]  They stay in the wild card hunt.  And finally had a good game rushing.  He had 23 for 190.  I love panicky Pete Dump guy.  That's great.  There's cunt, cunt, cunt.  Why does he have an audience?  He dumps out.  I don't know.  People seem to not like him.  But he has a big audience.  He's got history behind him.  And he's talking about what they want to hear about.  And you can even want him in the post office or wherever.  He can stay on.  He's mindless sports banter.  Look, we're miserable like Mike Francesa. 
[00:31:00]  But if you listen to our voices, you can't tell.  No.  He just goes.  By the way, I'm not miserable.  I was just saying that for the radio.  Idiots.  Yeah.  I fucking love what I do.  We're a little miserable.  I just wish we could do it for a cool company.  That's all.  I wish we could do it.  Sorry.  3 p.m. too would be nice.  Would you do afternoons again if you could?  I think I'd go back to afternoons if I could.  You want to do three?  Yeah.  You can do three.  Do three to seven.  I'm going to start doing three. 
[00:31:30]  When?  Tomorrow.  I wouldn't want to do it like at three.  I'd be like, oh, if we're doing mornings, it would be over already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you got to start at seven.  Then your whole night goes all haywire.  No, it's kind of good.  I always like the fact that at seven o'clock, I could go out, do shit, get to sleep at whatever  hour and still be cool at 3 p.m.  You know?  It's like, for some reason, your recharge factor is a lot easier to deal with if you 
[00:32:00]  don't have to be anywhere until three.  Yeah, but I don't do much when we did afternoons.  I would never do my mortgage or any stuff I do in the morning now.  You do your mortgage every morning?  Yes, I do.  I go to the bank and I'm like, I say, why is there a T in that work?  No, but I mean bank business and things that you don't want to do.  It's like, I can do them after work, but I couldn't get up and do them.  But since I'm on my way home, I can do them.  I would waste a lot of time because I was probably, you know, I was sleeping until three or two 
[00:32:30]  or whatever the fuck it was.  So, yeah, I probably cut a big chunk of my day out.  And the traffic you'd hit?  Although I do now anyway, too.  I fucking sleep from, yesterday, 11 a.m.  I was asleep at 11 in the morning until 5.30 p.m.  Jesus, that's unbelievable.  That's not a nap.  It's a whole fucking night's sleep.  You missed a great day.  I know.  We hit another record.  But then I went out.  I went out to dinner.  It was 70-something in New York.  Walking out to dinner in the city.  It was fucking nice at night, even. 
[00:33:00]  And, you know.  You still don't believe in that global warming, huh?  It's getting a little shaky out there.  I was actually talking to none other than Fred Norris in the elevator on the way up today  of the Howard Stern Show.  We're not supposed to like each other.  What are you doing?  And he was commenting on the fact that he loves global warming.  If you want to voice any complaints, you could tell Fred Norris that I heard him say,  fuck the polar bears.  Because he said this global warming shit is great. 
[00:33:30]  I've seen Fred box.  I bet you he would love to box a polar bear.  He probably would.  Fred's a jolly guy in the morning.  He's a good guy.  He's like a happy, fun guy in the morning.  He's a good elevator ride.  I don't mind him in the elevator.  Some people, a bad elevator ride.  We took the cab together.  He's a very nice man.  He is.  Know who's a bad elevator ride?  Who?  Boy, Gary.  Why?  Fucking let it go, you cunt.  I like Gary.  Enough already.  He's another pleasant elevator ride.  This cunt gets in the elevator with a bunch of people and says hi to everyone and doesn't 
[00:34:00]  say hi to me.  I get it.  Take another elevator, you fuck.  Holy shit.  I've never had a problem with Bob, Bob, Boo, Heath.  Go away.  What's the matter?  I don't know.  I even tried when his stupid book was out.  I think there's a...  The weird thing is I'm already in the elevator and then he comes in the elevator, he'll say  hi to people, then he has his back to me and he fucking doesn't say hi.  I'm sure if you made the first move.  He goes out of his way to make sure he doesn't say hi.  I'm sure if you made the first move.  What fucking year is this? 
[00:34:30]  Be fine?  Me and Fred walk around together.  We...  We...  You holding hands?  We hold hands, yes.  Taking warm showers?  Yes.  When did this happen?  Huh?  It happens a lot.  I think there's still some...  Animosity.  You know, you gotta just say hi to him.  Last time I saw Howard, we both said hi to each other.  But, you know...  So he says hi.  I've never seen him.  Oh, it's rare.  In all the days I've come into this motherfucking building.  It's rare you see him, but he even says hi. 
[00:35:00]  He has said hi to Jimmy a bunch.  I hear rumor he's growing the Opie beard.  Well, I didn't know that.  Am I ripping him off?  I invented beards.  I auditioned characters as he's on his way out the elevator.  I'm like, hey, can I do your show, too?  Just in case things don't work out.  Oh, Chip.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Fred's a good elevator ride.  Robin's a good elevator ride.  Artie was a good elevator ride.  Who else? 
[00:35:30]  And all the other guys.  Sal.  Someone's saying, Opie, ever think it's you?  Well, maybe he said...  Maybe he said hi to you one time and you didn't hear it?  No.  And then he thought you didn't want to say hi to him.  I mean, and that's fair enough.  Sure, I think it's me.  No, this goes back to...  This goes way back.  Trust me, I've had many years to figure some shit out.  And yeah, I do think it's me.  That's fine.  But the other people have gotten through the bullshit that we went through over the years, right?  I don't think you've given the other people as much shit as you've given Gary over the years. 
[00:36:00]  Well, he's a douchebag.  See?  Now, that could be it.  Because he was a spy for Howard all those years.  And then he would strike up conversation with me and Ann.  It was all fake.  During those warring years.  And every time we did get in trouble with Howard, it was because this idiot was fucking calling Howard.  Do you know we actually have a tourism exchange with Vietnam now, Opie? 
[00:36:30]  All right.  We can go to Vietnam now and check out the tunnels that were used in the war.  When the war ends, you've got to kind of, you know, embrace Japan.  My point is then just take another elevator.  Don't make it uncomfortable for me and yourself.  But why hold on to those moments?  Because he's a fucking asshole.  See?  See that again?  He really is.  We wouldn't have a truce with Vietnam if our diplomats were going, ah, those slopes.  Dude, it would be no truce.  The fact is, now that we're getting into this, half the trouble we got in with Howard was because of Gary. 
[00:37:00]  Howard never heard half the shit we did.  But that was during the war.  But this fucking tattletale had to run and tell Howard every fucking time.  But the war's over.  It was during the war.  And I'm willing to accept that.  Don't get in my fucking elevator.  It's my elevator at that point.  I'm in it first.  Wouldn't one of our guys have come back?  There's six other elevators ready to go upstairs.  Take one of those.  Wouldn't somebody from the ONA side would have come back and told this show everything, too? 
[00:37:30]  I don't mind that because it's part of that.  It goes both ways.  You've got to be loyal to whoever you're with.  We had some shit that we pulled shenanigans.  They pulled shenanigans.  And that's what I'm getting at.  We both pulled shenanigans.  But it's over now.  So if he gets in the elevator.  He put out a good book.  Kevin from Connecticut's pointing out how the Jews forgave those Nazis.  You've got to let it go.  No?  Sure.  Almost positive.  He thought that actually happened.  He's the last holdout.  He really is.  I bet he says that about you. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Whatever, dude.  What the fuck?  Come on.  Whatever.  You're not going to just say hi one day?  I did.  That's what I'm getting at.  No?  Me and Fred piss next to each other and have a nice conversation.  Do you hold each other's wieners?  Is Fred big down there?  He's got a large dong.  I bet he does.  Does he have a putt or a dong?  He's got a dong.  Fred's got a cock.  He's got a cock.  He's got a dong.  It's too peaceful to not have a cock.  Nobody is that mellow with a small dick.  Oh, God. 
[00:38:30]  God, I mean, enough.  Yeah?  To make it known you don't want to say hi, but you get on the same elevator.  It's like, wait it out.  When you see him coming, do you hit that closed door button?  Ask Kenny.  When we see him coming up the sidewalk, I'll go, let's sit a few minutes.  Really?  And then I'll let him take his own stupid elevator.  Well, you should get in the elevator.  I would never let someone get in the elevator for me.  I'm the elevator kid.  I hop right in.  Boom.  Up.  Ding.  I like the no pressure of being able to just, like, I don't care who's in the building. 
[00:39:00]  In the elevator.  There's no stress anymore.  Exactly.  As long as they're not fat.  Yeah.  Huh?  As long as they're not fat, I don't care who's in my elevator.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he looked at Eric.  I didn't say anything.  I know.  He's a sex man.  The people, they actually won't let him on the same limo.  The same limo.  The same.  I was going to say the same elevator is Howard's limo because he's fat.  But Sam's head got in my way.  Move so I can communicate with Eric.  Thank you.  You hear the elevator sigh when he walks up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The elevator's rooting for, like, whichever elevator gets the limo considers itself lucky. 
[00:39:30]  Sorry, Eric.  I don't mean.  I'm just teasing saying you're heavy.  It's more than a car.  I'm getting beat up by a hater.  Is it really your elevator?  Yeah.  If I'm in it for.  First, yes, it is.  You think it is?  Yes.  You guys should be commended how polite and cordial you are.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Yes.  Me and Kenny laugh with Ron, Ronnie, all the fucking time.  I take the elevator up with him more than anyone. 
[00:40:00]  We just fucking joke and have a good time.  I like what Fezzy said about it.  He actually said, I like being alone in the elevator.  It's like first class.  It's like being in first class in the elevator.  And it is.  When that door shuts and no one's stepped in with you, it's like, ah, you could just, ah.  When did Fezzy say that, 2007?  Oh, wow.  Wait, what happened?  Holy shit.  What happened?  Holy shit.  What happened there?  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  What happened?  I'll tell you what happened.  I don't understand.  Shit. 
[00:40:30]  Some shit.  What happened?  Some shit.  What happened?  Just had a big spoon put in it.  What happened?  And moved in a circular motion.  What happened?  What happened?  Is what just happened.  What happened?  God damn it.  What happened?  Another fucking month of shit now.  What happened?  I need to understand now.  You implied.  Oh, shit.  What?  That 2007 was when Fez might have said something.  Oh, shit.  That's insane.  God damn it.  I pointed out that it was very funny that he pointed, that he said that an elevator, when 
[00:41:00]  you're alone in it, it's like being in first class.  And play it back.  Like, I laughed at the line.  I thought it was funny.  Oh, boy.  2007 was almost five years ago.  Oh, no.  Almost five.  A month from now?  Oh.  It would be five years ago.  Oh.  So, what should I have said?  That would have put us in the other building, wouldn't it?  What should I have said?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  What should I have said?  You probably shouldn't have said anything.  We were watching our language on K-Rock.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  Well, there's two people in the building Opie's going to be uncomfortable in the elevator with. 
[00:41:30]  I didn't do shit.  Yes, you did.  I didn't do shit that time.  Oh, my.  That time, you definitely did.  Oh, my Lord.  2007 comment, for sure.  Oh, that was fun.  That was kind of unnecessary.  That's going to cause some problems.  Just out of nowhere.  What?  This afternoon.  I mean, it's just, yeah.  What happened?  That's going to leave a mark.  I'm going to start saying that like they do in those movies.  That's a good phrase.  I know.  So, where are we at?  We're good with Howard's crew, except for Gary.  Well, no.  I think you're not good with Gary.  Now you're saying we, and you're going to make uncomfortable elevator rides for Anthony. 
[00:42:00]  Right after.  Because you're saying we are not good with Gary, and Anthony just said he was fine with everybody.  Right after North American Scum, you're just going to hear some shit.  Yeah.  It's going to be a rough one.  What happened?  Yeah.  Everyone's good.  We're all happy.  No.  Oh, boy.  You took a dastardly shot.  That was dastardly.  Huh?  I mean, you just took a venomous, dastardly shot.  Of who?  Very surprising.  Mr. Fez Watley.  I like how Sam just has this horrible yelling Gary picture up on the computer. 
[00:42:30]  I wanted Obi to feel like he was arguing with him.  In the elevator?  In the elevator.  Say, I'm not saying hi to you!  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't do shit, man.  That time you did.  Well.  Definitely did.  Yeah.  You want to hear about the Occupy guy?  I certainly do.  What do you want to do?  I kind of want to hear Occupy guy.  Why can't we break?  Why do we have to talk for an hour and a half straight?  Oh, my God.  That is true.  That's less time to do when you're back. 
[00:43:00]  The more we talk, the less time you have to break.  Jimmy thinks like I do.  Yeah.  If we talk until 6.51, we're back by 6.54.  That's better than being back at 6.53.  Yeah.  That is true.  We'll be back at 7.01.  Back tomorrow.  Right, Fatso?  Oh!  Jesus!  The venomous strength continues.  There is another elevator villain.  Yes.  You're just counting elevator villains now?  Yes.  Obi comes to work trying to make enemies.  I've got too many friends. 
[00:43:30]  Job well done.  I'm getting along with most people these days.  Yeah?  Yeah, I am.  You did until this break.  Yeah.  But it's like...  Oh, yeah.  Scott.  Oh, that's right.  You forget that this microphone goes out there.  Right.  But, I mean, it's been enough years.  Gary, just fucking chill the fuck out, man.  That's coming from me.  Yelling at you.  Maybe he's saying that, though.  Yeah.  Nah, I tried.  You did?  Yeah, but when his book came out, I was like, you know what?  This is a good time to maybe say, hey, I'll fucking read the book, first of all. 
[00:44:00]  Where did this happen?  In the elevator.  He knows.  Because he interviewed Jimmy.  Jimmy interviewed...  How did that go?  I interviewed him for Raw Dog for the Comedy Channel.  Not to blow up your spot, but I thought it was on the radio, where Gary even said, yeah,  even Opie said nice things about the book.  Oh, maybe he did.  I don't remember.  What was the interaction after the book interaction?  Have you been in the elevator with him since you complimented his book?  I haven't even thought of him since.  But he hasn't been in the elevator.  Until all of a sudden he pops in the elevator and he's already in a bad mood because I'm in  the elevator with him.  Has he snubbed you since you complimented his book? 
[00:44:30]  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  The answer was no.  So you're on good terms.  So it sounds like everything was...  Your last interaction was smoothed over.  I get a feeling when things are tense.  You know.  Yeah, I know.  I've lived my whole life that way.  It sounds like everything was smoothed over until you yelled into the mic that he's a dick.  No, he said douchebag and asshole.  Oh, right.  And cunt.  Thank you.  A lot of genital descriptions.  All right.  I'm good.  All right.  I'm good with him then.  No, he's not good with you though. 
[00:45:00]  No, it's all good then.  Everything's good.  He just insulted him and Fez and fatso.  I didn't insult Fez.  Fatso.  I mean, he said fatso.  Get a little fatso over there.  We all say shit and then you try to remember when that was said.  That's all I'm going for.  You think 2007 is when he said that quote?  Why do you think that specific quote was said in 2007?  Oh, no.  You guys don't even understand what you're doing.  Why?  Fez talks a lot. 
[00:45:30]  What are you doing?  I don't understand why you would credit that quote to 2007 is.  I was asking because I didn't know when it was said.  I don't want to.  It could have been 2009.  I don't know.  I don't want to be part of this fallout.  Certainly not after 2009.  The fallout that's going to come down because of this.  It's a horrible thing.  Such a terrible thing.  I was just trying to figure out.  I know somewhere between 07 and 09.  I know that much.  Oh.  Oh, I don't know.  But it was definitely not after 2000.  Oh, absolutely not. 
[00:46:00]  What?  It's horrible.  Love those guys.  Love them.  Love them.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  Shouldn't have said that.  So we're good, right?  With who?  I think we're all good with everybody.  I think we're good.  Fatso.  Eric?  Douchebag.  Not talky.  Yeah.  Mute, Fatso, and Douchebag.  We're good with everybody.  Everybody's good. 
[00:46:30]  I'm just sick of going through the same shit every day.  You got the fat fuck that hates us but makes believe he doesn't, but then he does.  It's like, do you hate us today?  What's your deal?  The guys I won't talk to in the building, I wasn't talking to that guy Larry Flick for  a while because he said he referenced us on the air and he never came over and said  he was wrong and it kind of annoyed me, but I was like blatantly rude to him and not  talking to him.  But I like the other guy, the black dude I like.  I don't know his name, but on the elevator, he's a pleasant man.  What's that?  Keith. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, he's a nice dude.  I say hi to everybody.  So I did.  There's one guy.  The only guy.  In the whole building.  I won't say hi to it was that guy.  The old guy.  Wait.  What do we talk about?  No, no, no.  Wait, wait, who don't you say hi to?  This is way better than my bullshit.  I will never speak to, um, who's it?  Alex Bennett.  He's the one guy I won't say hello to.  No, I even, you know what?  I even give him the head nod.  No, I won't give him the head nod going back and forth to the bathroom or something.  I won't give him even that.  Nah.  He's the only guy I won't be courteous.  I won't, I won't be rude to him.  Like I wouldn't slam a door in his face. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, that's probably where I stand.  But I would, I would never even give him a courteous hello.  No.  But there's someone I despise in this building that I would never even fucking give a head  nod to.  I hope it's who I think it is.  What?  I hope it's who I think.  It's E-Rock.  Oh.  No.  Wait, let me get someone you despise.  Everyone's in a bad spot now.  Despise.  I know.  Are you going to say who it is?  I'm not going to say who it is, but is it the one we think?  I don't know.  Who do you think?  The one everyone hates.  No, no, no, no.  He has a show.  I don't know.  No, no, he doesn't have a show.  No. 
[00:48:00]  He's not a management?  I'm just going to say, that fucking Australian cunt that ratted us out.  Oh, yeah, Mark.  Go fuck yourself.  Mark, the engineer guy, whatever it was.  You piece of shit.  I've never forgotten.  What is he?  And he comes by and nods.  Go fuck yourself.  The guy was trying to put us in.  He was working with Dave Herman.  Oh.  And Dave Herman went to sue us.  And he was wiretapping us.  The fucking guy was wiretapping us, and we could say it because it came out in the court case.  Yeah.  And now he works here, and he makes believe we don't know.  He was all smiley. 
[00:48:30]  Or he's hoping we don't know, I guess.  As he was recording us when we thought the mics were off.  Oh, wow.  And, yeah, that motherfucker.  Oh, fuck, yeah, you're right.  Go fuck his mother.  I thought you were going to say Pharrell.  No, this guy.  No, no.  Even Pharrell, I could give a shit.  He's a douchebag.  He's a mute, fat douchebag.  This guy came across like he was our pal, you know, and he would come in and all that.  And then we find out that he was secretly wiretapping us.  We should have sued his fucking ass.  Yeah, fuck him.  Yeah.  And they weren't allowed to use the tapes in the case. 
[00:49:00]  Dig-a-doop, dig-a-doop.  Because it's illegal.  I don't give a shit about him.  Illegal shit.  Yeah.  It is.  I'm good with Pharrell.  Are you?  Just good.  Just good.  If I was in the elevator with him, I wouldn't talk to him.  I'd call him a douchebag.  I know.  Fuck him.  I knew it.  Fuck Pharrell.  I knew it.  I saw Scott.  I saw him at the other time.  Remember we did the football thing?  Shut up. 
[00:49:30]  He was very nice last time I saw him.  Was he?  Yeah.  Good for you.  I knew it.  Good for Pharrell.  Oh, Iraq?  Yeah, I saw him a few days ago, and he said hi.  And he goes, how bad did they hate me today?  And I said, they never mention you ever.  Yeah.  Until today.  So now you can go back to him.  Yeah.  I guess we just don't.  A lot of these guys just show their true colors.  They're shining through.  Yeah.  They used to be rah-rah, and then all of a sudden they get a chance to fucking beat the shit out of us  to maybe get in better with someone else, and they always go for it. 
[00:50:00]  Mark that Australian fuck.  Oh, yeah.  That's how.  Sam's making the mad at list.  So far we have Douchebag, Twat, Fatso, Mute, and Mark that Australian fuck, and Pharrell.  Yeah.  I'm not mad at it.  Pharrell, Shigadu.  I'm not mad at it.  It's a collective list.  I'm not mad at Iraq.  At all.  No.  So take Fatso off the list.  You called him Fatso.  Yeah, but he is.  That's endearing.  Oh.  Yeah.  How about on bad terms? 
[00:50:30]  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's fat, so why don't we?  Yeah.  Obviously.  So we take advantage of it.  If he cared, he wouldn't be an eating machine.  Right.  On bad terms with.  That means it's on either side.  I'm not on bad terms.  Iraq, are we on bad terms?  No.  No.  Let's pull back a wall here.  For me, it's only that fucking one guy.  The only one I don't like.  Yeah.  Let me think.  One, two, three.  He always walks by and just glares in here.  I don't like him just because I know that he went and complained up to upper management because  we were making fun of him when he had started it.  Yeah.  That was my only issue.  Yeah.  And don't talk shit about me and then get mad when I'm better at it. 
[00:51:00]  And he used to do this edgy shit.  Right.  So he should understand this crap.  If he had come to me one time and said, all right, look, that was kind of stupid I attacked  you guys the first day, I would never have a bad thing to say about him.  I'm really easy.  No one would do that, though.  But you know what I mean?  Yeah.  So that's the one person I just will never speak to.  I'm going to count now.  One.  Fuck.  Main guy, two, unfortunately, which is going to be not good in the end.  One.  On the bad terms list?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Gotcha.  One.  So they put main guy.  Yeah.  One, two, three, four.  We need more names for the list.  At least code names.  Four that instantly put me in a bad mood if I see them.  Four that instantly put...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Main guy.  Main guy who's going to put out his stupid email Christmas card soon.  And that's going to put you in a bad mood?  Oh, will it?  Oh, will it?  Will you respond?  Thank you.  Many to you.  No raises. 
[00:52:00]  No bonuses.  No nothing.  No Christmas parties.  No nothing.  But this pompous ass will put out a Christmas card for the entire company.  How long will you be in a bad mood for after the Christmas card?  That one drives me nuts.  This year I think I'm going to tweet it so everyone else can feel my pain.  So who's the four?  Why wouldn't there be Christmas bonuses once in a while?  That really is shitty.  Like once in a while a Christmas bonus for your fucking crew?  But if you did care about, you know, your staff, then fucking actually have a Christmas card you could give them. 
[00:52:30]  But to mass email something?  Ugh!  Ugh!  I think bonuses would be nice for people.  Bonuses went away years ago.  Did they really?  For everybody.  I mean, everyone that's listening to us.  For everybody.  When was the last time we had a Christmas party?  I think the last bonus was that first year when they gave us the Mi-Fi.  That was it.  And I know the last Christmas party Tom Chiasana was at.  The K-Rock Christmas party?  Yeah.  So that was, we've been off regular radio for, I don't know, three years maybe now? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, yes!  So probably four years was the last time we had a Christmas party.  And Christmas parties in radio were just amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Big parties.  A lot of drunks.  I don't think most of the staff got invited to the K-Rock Christmas party.  Half the sales girls would come around and just blow you in the bathroom.  What?  I wish I had fun.  What happened then?  Well.  Yeah.  Who's the other three guys that instantly put you in a bad mood?  You can use code names.  I've pretty much said it. 
[00:53:30]  I'm going to guess Twat.  The one that, Twat, main guy.  Wait, who's Twat again?  A-B.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The one you don't like, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yes, yes, Twat.  And Mark, I'm with Dan on that big fucking thing.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's Mark.  The Australian fuck.  Okay.  Right.  I don't know him.  You'd know him if you saw him.  Scott.  Scott Farrell.  Don't talk.  I don't respect him anymore whatsoever.  But I'm all right. 
[00:54:00]  I'm just good.  Shut up.  I'm just good.  A minute ago you were good with him, and then you had to come out and say, I don't respect him.  Yeah, you're getting mixed messages.  I'll tell you why.  Because the last I knew, we were good.  I'll tell you why.  The last time I knew, we were good with Scott Farrell.  We all worked at NAW together, and everything was fucking cool.  You know, we all kind of went our own ways, unfortunately, because we blew up everyone's fucking spot.  Yeah.  And then the first chance he got to trash us, he did to try to get him better with Howard.  And at the time, I'm like, I don't remember doing anything bad to this fucking guy. 
[00:54:30]  Last I knew, we were all very fucking cool.  We all knew the same people.  You know, I don't know what we could have possibly done to that guy that he decided to aggressively attack us.  We did nothing, and that's why he's a fuck dick.  And it's all because he has a shallow fucking, you know, self-worth, and he felt this was his way of getting in better with Howard.  And guess what?  Howard, in the end, doesn't fucking look at that shit.  He laughs at people like that.  All right, but him you're good with.  But I'm just good with. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  But that's when I turned with him.  I'm like, I could never be friends with this guy.  He doesn't know who the fuck he is.  But he doesn't put you in a bad mood.  Nah.  I feel sorry for him.  Elevator, you'd be all right?  Yeah.  That's the litmus test.  The elevator ride.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just got one guy, that Australian fuck.  That's it, huh?  He's the one guy that if he got in the elevator, I'd walk right the fuck off.  Wow.  I'd be like, that, nope, ain't riding up with you.  I think if you were in the elevator with Pharrell, at first, you'd be okay. 
[00:55:30]  And then while you were in there, you'd be thinking about him.  And by the time you got out, you'd be all pissed.  I would, if he opened his mouth, I would just say, don't even talk.  Don't even talk to me.  You'd be okay with Pharrell in an elevator, as long as a silent elevator ride.  Yes.  Okay.  It would have to be silent, uncomfortable elevator ride.  You should do an elevator joke or something.  That always alleviates the tension.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Love that.  The job has its ups and downs.  It's terrible.  It's a good one.  Get somebody laughing.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, that's a good one.  Oh, this guy got his shit face.  He glares at me.  This guy actually got a Christmas bonus.  Do you think he's joking?  I don't think anyone gets Christmas bonuses anymore.  No, those things are a thing of the past.  Jeff, what do you got?  Did you really get a Christmas bonus?  I did this morning.  It was a shitty bonus, but it was one nonetheless, a whole 180 bucks, and after taxes, it's  a hundred bucks.  A hundred dollars.  You know what?  I swear to you, if that asshole down the hall gave me a hundred dollar bill, it would 
[00:56:30]  make me a bit happy.  It wouldn't put you in a bad mood?  Because in the end, it's a hundred dollars.  You could take your lady out for a little fucking dinner.  That's nice.  Hey, you take your fancy lady out.  A little dinner here for a hundred bucks.  Where do you eat?  I don't go to establishment for less than 500.  You know why?  Because in the end, Jeff, it's the thought.  That's it.  You're not really thinking of your employees when you send out a mass email that covers  Hanukkah and Christmas.  Yeah, exactly.  Catholics and Jews, and anyone, Ramadan, here you go. 
[00:57:00]  Smile.  LOL.  Send.  Right.  Kwanzaa.  I just wanted to tell Sam, too, that I get paid twice as much as she does to sit on  my ass and do nothing all day.  Thank you for mentioning that.  Yeah, Sam really is a fucking lump.  That's not what the point of that was.  That's what that was.  No.  You're kind of a lump.  You're a shitster.  I didn't do shit today, and all of a sudden I'm in a world of hurt now.  He was talking about being, that I was underpaid, not that I was a lump.  He just said he gets paid twice. 
[00:57:30]  Never mind.  I need dark sunglasses now just so I can get to the elevator today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He started saying comfortable.  Nasty things about people again, like you do from time to time.  You know, at some point, Opie, you've got to open that door and walk these hallways.  I love honesty.  I love my favorite.  Good song.  What was your favorite one, Sam?  I'm not going to tell you what my favorite one was.  I know what your favorite one is, and that's why I'm fucking calling you out now.  Tell everyone what your favorite one was.  My favorite one, because... 
[00:58:00]  Don't lie.  I won't.  Because you're not lying, so I won't lie.  But because of the out-of-nowhere-ness, the shock of it all, just the unnecessariness,  was the question of if the quote that Anthony credited to Fez had been said in 2007.  Yes.  Just out of nowhere.  There was no call for that one.  And totally unnecessary.  I'm just trying to snap him out of it.  Fez has taken everything, if you want to know the truth, everything way too seriously. 
[00:58:30]  You're just trying to spice things up to give him an angle?  I'm just trying to snap him out of it.  I gotcha.  This is all stupid in the end.  It really is.  Just goofing around.  Except for Mark, that Australian fuck.  Yeah, fuck him.  No, I'm not trying to fucking wake him up.  He's a cunt.  That's unforgivable.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  Never.  I wish that's egregious.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, we were scared shitless back then, man.  We were in the middle of a multi-million dollar lawsuit.  First one of our careers.  He was suing the company, but then he dragged us into it, so we had responsibility there. 
[00:59:00]  And all of a sudden, we'd find out that this guy was wiretapping us.  When you get...  Wiretapping, Sam.  When you get your first lawsuit, and it's for $10 million...  Was it $10 million?  Yeah, it makes you go like, ha, oh, yeah, ha, you know...  Was the company covering your legal expenses?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, cool.  Well, back then, they used to do that type of thing.  Oh, yeah.  That's another thing.  They don't do that anymore.  What?  Oh, it was like a miraculous place back in those days. 
[00:59:30]  We have to watch our own asses now.  Yeah.  But when you see that fucking lawsuit and go like, oh, uh...  Oof.  Ugh.  I've heard about these.  You never know what a jury will do.  You just don't know.  It never goes that far.  No, of course not, but...  They threw it out, as a matter of fact.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, the guy at the time who was doing mornings, you know, we couldn't help  it that his wife, his ex-wife befriended us and was telling us about lawn.  Yeah, yeah.  Yard sales, I mean. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, she got on the air with us.  That could be one of my favorite things ever.  Oh, it was fantastic.  She may have imbibed a bit of alcohol.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And been chatting enough about a yard sale she was having.  It was fantastic.  And stuff that this guy cherished was now going to be on the front lawn for people  to buy.  Yeah.  On the station you were on?  Oh, yeah.  Why would she start fighting with the people?  You're supposed to start fighting with your competitors.  He was doing the morning show, and she was calling us in the afternoons.  Were you friends with him or no? 
[01:00:30]  No.  No.  Oh, you weren't.  The whole place hated us.  No.  You want a fuck-go list, man.  And when you get the ex-wife calling, talking about her yard sale that she's having and  what she's selling of the morning guys, wow, that was some great radio.  And he had great shit, too.  Gold records that were signed and old leather jackets that he cherished.  Did she sell them all?  I don't know what ended up happening with that whole thing.  Wow.  And you guys were the cool show, so you basically created an environment where you were like,  listen, the entire station is shit except for us. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  And all the listeners.  We told all in New York that.  Yeah.  It worked.  Yeah.  Oh, it did?  It fucking did.  We were...  This place is easy compared to that place.  Despised.  This place is easy.  We used to go to work.  There was not one friendly face.  They all hated us.  I don't even know how we were able to do radio in that environment.  Well, you were unapologetically trying to...  And we had no audience.  No one gave a shit about us yet.  No.  No one cared.  For months.  No one gave a shit.  You were just like, fuck it.  So the audience fucking basically didn't care, and then the whole staff hated us openly. 
[01:01:30]  It was rough.  Except for Scott Muni, man.  I'll say it until I fucking retire.  That guy was the real deal.  That guy was the real deal.  He even sat outside the studio to listen to our first break, and then walked down the  hall and said to our boss at the time, like, ah, these guys are going to be all right.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a legend in this business.  But the rest of the douchebags...  Sitting in his office as he droned on about John Lennon.  Right.  When was he on? 
[01:02:00]  What hours?  At that point, they were only giving him like...  1909?  No, I mean the hours of the day.  At that point, they were giving him like an hour.  He was at the end.  Oh, he's just...  Of his life and his career, unfortunately.  But we would sit in his office, and he would go, ah, yeah, this is a Keith Moon stick he  gave me one time.  It's just laying around.  It's an empty whiskey bottle.  I drank this with Jim Morrison.  The shit he had in his office.  I'm making it up on the spot.  He knew all those guys, though.  He would pull out...  I wish I could remember.  He would pull out letters like, ah, yeah, Paul McCartney wrote me this as a thank you note. 
[01:02:30]  All those people I hung with, and now it's just Earl.  Right.  Oh, I don't even like riding the elevator with him.  How old was he when he died, Muni?  Not that old, but he had a drinking...  I hate Earl.  I remember, uh, what was it?  Would it be, uh, which way goes south?  6th or 7th Avenue?  7th Avenue South.  7th Avenue.  Was it 7th?  Yeah, 7th Avenue.  He's barreling out of the garage the wrong way with his car.  Jesus. 
[01:03:00]  The guy fucking ruled, man.  Those guys, like, who are those, like, there's...  Cousin Brucey is one of those guys that's just, like, even though he was, like,  more classic rock than, like, you know, like, you know, rock and roll.  There's a couple of those guys around that were fucking just, like, those legendary...  I like those dudes.  I just said nothing, but...  Brucey's cool.  He's a great guy.  He's come on the show, and he shows he has a little edge, and he can go with it.  I always hated that...  Fucking Earl.  Fuck that...  Oh, Earl, lighten up. 
[01:03:30]  I like anyone that knew the Beatles.  It's rare to find those guys anymore.  True.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not many.  I met him, but...  You didn't meet the Beatles?  I did.  What?  So stupid.  Were you the fifth Beatle?  No, it's just boom.  I mean, Paul, jam a guitar.  It was just boom.  Just boom.  Yeah.  Wow, people are still getting bonuses out there.  Yeah.  Really?  Congratulations, man.  That's cool.  That means your boss shows a little fucking heart.  Even if it's a small bonus.  Just a dumb little thing. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  Or a gift certificate somewhere, like just...  Anything.  Something extra for the holidays.  It's like knowing that everybody's taking it in the shitter.  Yeah.  Stupid fat Oprah comes around, and they close the place for her and spend thousands and thousands,  tens of thousands of dollars.  Put stupid fat Oprah.  She takes care of her employees, too.  Fucking Elo walked me around that facility, and he showed me photos of their fucking company  trips.  And it's a smaller company than here, but Harpo takes care of their people, man.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  She brings them on a cruise for two weeks.  That's nice.  Jerks everybody off.  Oh, God.  I mean, I'm making that up.  Fantastic.  But the amount of money they spend when she comes once a year, or used to...  For elevator insurance.  I could take...  Gotta bring her up the freight elevator there, but besides that...  I could take Jess out to about 15 dinners for 100 bucks.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I know, man.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  That poor girl.  Oh, boy.  Is she making an error?  I know.  She doesn't even realize what's out there.  She knows she's got it good.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, fucking wrestling photos and signed shares.  Does she have to sit there while you watch that fucking inane wrestling?  Monday night.  Just last night.  And does she enjoy this, or does she look at you like, oh...  She's probably on her laptop, not facing Sam, so he can't see.  Yeah.  She's in her secret email.  It's G-R-L, number four, B-L-K.  Jesus.  I don't think so.  No, you don't think so?  I doubt it.  I mean... 
[01:05:30]  You want to hear about Birdman's bonus?  Birdman?  Birdman, is this real?  Let's get a bunch of feed or something.  What's going on?  Hey, listen, my wife gets a $25,000 bonus.  What?  What does she do?  She sucks the boss's cock.  Oh, no.  That wasn't...  No, no, she's a human resource director.  She's not...  Fuck ass.  She brings her money.  Wait, you really...  This guy's a catch.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  She really brings that kind of bonus.  It's out there, Jeff.  But wait, now, since we don't know you or your wife, what does she make a year? 
[01:06:00]  She makes, like, $130,000.  So that's a 5%.  And you think she's having an affair with the boss?  No, she's busting balls, but she makes a fucking nice bonus.  That's a big bonus for $130,000 a year.  $25,000 a year.  That's a lot, man.  She used to work for this other company, a dot-com company.  She used to get, like, $50,000, $60,000 sometimes.  Wow.  I think that was big money.  I get, like, $5.  I think we should have this guy.  $5.  He's got, like, $5.  What do you do, man?  I want to call the construction company.  I was going to say that. 
[01:06:30]  Nice.  I swear.  Fucking nice.  You sound like every guy that I've ever met on any job site.  Fun else.  Hey, fucking, you know, these Mexicans, you pick them up.  They don't even know what a fucking 2x4 is.  Nice, right?  All right, guys.  I think you're about right, guys.  What is a fair bonus, I guess?  What percentage of your salary do you think?  $100.  $100.  Jesus.  At this point, people would take 1%.  I'm, like, I'm wondering what's...  Holy fuck, you'd take 1%.  You'd appreciate that.  You'd go, holy crap, they're actually thinking about me around the holidays. 
[01:07:00]  $5.  I haven't had, like, a job like that in so long.  I don't know what percentages...  Remember the bonus?  Remember the bonus?  Yeah, people really look forward to that.  Oh, it was great.  Christmas tips.  We still...  In the tip industry, you, like, anything with tips, you give big, like, my garage guys.  We talk about that every year.  Oh, right.  That's coming around.  I avoid them.  I just don't do my car until, like, January 8th.  Is that it?  Sorry, boys.  I was away.  You missed your big tip.  You tip.  I told Kenny this morning, everyone is extra nice in my building because it's Christmas 
[01:07:30]  bonus time.  You gotta tip, like...  And by the way...  I gotta tip my mailman and stuff.  Why do you tip the mailman?  It's his job.  Kenny, how much did I have to spend last year?  $50.  Kenny knows.  He does all the paperwork.  Yes, G.H.  How much?  Well, G.H., you should be commended because you like to spread the holiday cheer.  We haven't talked about this in a year, but the pamphlet, the book, it's almost a book  at this point. 
[01:08:00]  Is it?  Has arrived.  And basically, it's everyone that works in the building and what they do.  Yeah, but G.H., I've learned from you it's better to give than to receive.  How many envelopes?  In your case, misery, yes.  A bullet.  Is it safe to say 40 envelopes last year?  Yes, it's in the high 30s.  High 30s.  Yes.  Envelopes with cash in every single one of them.  Yeah.  For people I've never seen, I don't know what they do in the building, but they'll tell  you.  When I first started working in the city and parking here, the parking lot gave me a 
[01:08:30]  Christmas card around November, and I was like, oh, that's so nice.  Thank you.  Then I opened it, and all the names were in there, and I was like, oh, that's pretty  cool.  Oh, and then it took me like a day to realize, oh, that's so I can give them money.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's not a Christmas card.  No.  No, and you shouldn't be forced to do it.  Jim's a big tipper, too.  He likes to spread it around.  This year, no way.  AIDS?  Yes, I do.  I give them each a brand new $5 bill. 
[01:09:00]  Oh.  $5.  I'll actually do this in front of their face with it, like where you take it.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Here it is.  I scrape it under their chin.  Here you go, boy.  There you go.  Spend it all in one place.  By the way, I was talking about building expenses about a month or so ago, and I said  it's about $2,500 a month for maintenance charges.  Yeah.  Okay?  And someone goes, wow, that's a pretty cheap mortgage.  No, dopes. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, boy.  That's throwaway money that I'll never see again.  It has nothing to do with my mortgage.  That's what I have to pay just to live in the building.  To have them keep the place gussied up.  Right.  But someone got confused and go, wow, that's your mortgage?  Why are you bitching?  I'm bitching because it's $2,500 so guys could open the door and maybe bring a package up  to my door every once in a while.  I'm bitching because I'm cool.  I'll say you are.  Bitching.  Surfing USA or something.  Yeah.  Oh.  Surfing USA.  How much money is that, Kenny? 
[01:10:00]  40 envelopes, let's say.  400 bucks.  40 envelopes.  Yeah, because you're bitching about your mailman.  Who cares?  I wish I had that.  Well, I have to tip the mailman.  Garbage guys?  I have to tip the garbage guys.  And that's it, right?  Yeah.  How much do you give them?  How much do you give a garbage guy?  50 bucks?  Yeah, you give them 50.  I'm going to be good to my garage guys because I don't usually give them dollars when I get  my car, so I'll tip them really well.  Yeah.  Yeah, G.H., don't worry.  Tis the season.  Got to tip the garage guys, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's tip the fucking parking guys. 
[01:10:30]  Believe me, they all get the celebrity tip.  So the Escalade comes up lickety-split.  I tip the garage guys well because I don't want my lug nuts unloosened.  And you don't want them fucking leaving your battery drain?  Like, you don't want them leaving your lights on?  Hey!  Mr. Guy that don't throw the tips.  Hey, Mr. Battery Drain.  I've got to charge the battery up.  I tip the deli guys to get your breakfast in the morning.  Why?  That's good.  Yeah.  I guess I know why, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they don't come in the sandwich. 
[01:11:00]  Because it's not my money, it's yours.  Yeah, you're like throwing around everybody's cash all up.  Where are we on bad terms list?  Yeah, you got Douchebag.  Who's Douchebag, though?  That would be...  Come on.  That's who you said earlier.  That was who you started.  You started there.  There's a photo of him right there.  The guy yelling.  Remember?  You called him Douchebag?  I want one of those serious sweatshirts off the record.  How about that as a bonus?  The serious...  The guys get sweatshirts!  Don't get a fucking maniac out of me.  He's in the building, by the way, one of these days.  No way. 
[01:11:30]  Paul Anka, yeah.  Paul Anka?  I would never wear that sweatshirt.  I've worn it.  No!  I have mine.  I'd wear that.  You wouldn't wear that.  It's a plain one.  I like the look of it.  Yeah, because it's just plain.  It's very comfortable.  It's one of those collegiate looking...  And the hood is big.  Which I need.  Yeah, you do.  To hide that fucking stupid wash woman hair.  Fucking awful kissy hair.  You should be spitting in Sandy Duncan's drink.  Fucking creep.  Could have just left it at the hood.  No, but I wanted to really keep going with it.  The other people are Twat.  Yeah, I don't like Twat. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  This was how he was...  This is not me.  I'm not on bad terms with Mute.  Well, the bad terms means it's one or the other.  And let me tell you something.  After today, I would assume...  You are.  You are on bad terms with...  I'm not on bad terms with anyone.  ...the person who you referred to as Mute.  Good, man.  Mark that Australian fuck.  Oh, I'm on bad terms.  Yeah, fuck that guy.  Pharrell.  She is.  The main guy.  Main guy.  And stupid fat Oprah. 
[01:12:30]  Well, that was just a reference point.  I know, but you called her stupid fat Oprah.  Well, you know the company has money when they do things like that for someone that's not really...  ...doesn't give a fuck about the company.  That's true.  And then you got people that really give a fuck about this place and work hard day in and day out, and they get nothing in the end.  Who are they?  But as soon as Oprah comes around, they'll close up the place and spend tens of thousands of fucking dollars on her.  I got, by the way, a text.  Oh.  And one week pay for Xmas bonus.  I guess that's the standard. 
[01:13:00]  One week?  Yeah.  So $5.  I didn't know that.  $5.  One week.  Wow.  But even if it's not a week's salary, they should give something here, because the company's doing okay.  I have stock.  It's not doing...  Dude, it was a nickel at one point.  $0.15.  Now it's $1.79.  It's been bouncing up.  It's like, come on, man.  And the economy stinks.  It's not like the economy's going great.  Yeah.  So I think they're doing well.  I wish it was different, but I now know in my heart it'll never be different, unfortunately.  It makes it easier to live with, I guess. 
[01:13:30]  But that's the beauty, you guys.  When you get lemons, you always make lemonade.  Yeah, we try.  And whenever you talk, there's a lot of lemons.  Milk, milk, lemonade, around the corner, fudges me.  That's right.  Stick your finger in the hole, out comes a Tootsie Roll.  That's right.  Let me get in there where they put the fudge.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Let me get in there and make the fudge soft.  Why?  That's still funny.  It is.  Yeah, give me some lemonade and milk.  That's not funny, though.  Yeah, it is. 
[01:14:00]  It's gross.  We put some Earl, we had a fudge comes out.  Earl.  Make it come out smoother.  Around the corner, fudge is made.  And it feels good when you put your wiener in it.  Is that Bernie Fine?  Of course.  Well, it could be any of them.  All right.  Or is it Curly?  I'm confused.  Curly.  Bernie Fine.  The feds are getting involved with the Syracuse thing.  And his wife, she couldn't keep her mouth shut.  What a blow of her mouth.  We never played that yesterday.  You want to play that?  One of the old spoon bank, keep her mouth shut.  We never played it.  We got it right here. 
[01:14:30]  We have audio for the ball peeing hammer.  We have audio of her?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We got to hear that.  We had Dr. J in yesterday, so it kind of messed us up a little bit.  And Coppola's saying he should have only made one Godfather.  We got a lot of stuff we haven't played.  Two Godfathers.  The third one was a disgrace.  Yeah, the third one sucked the...  The second part two is...  He says it should have only been one, but two is awesome.  Yeah, he gets better and better, too.  Two won Best Picture.  What's the matter with him?  He told TMZ there should have been one.  Yeah, this is a quickie.  He's just trying to be outrageous.  But part three was terrible.  Before break, we can do this really quick, because everyone loves the Godfather movies, 
[01:15:00]  right?  Oh, yeah.  Do you like three at all?  No.  They made them do it.  They said they were going to get Travolta.  They kind of said, we're going to do it with or without you, and he just did want the  legacy totally destroyed, so he did what he could with it.  Why would he put his daughter in it?  She sucked.  I know.  She was a horrendous actor.  Who were they going to get Travolta?  I don't know.  He was a Travolta.  But what's his name?  Robert Duvall purposely priced himself out.  Yeah.  Didn't want to do it.  Yeah.  Here's what he said.  Coppola, how are you doing tonight, sir?  How are you doing tonight?  It's an honor, sir. 
[01:15:30]  It's an honor, sir.  It's an honor.  I have one question for you.  What do you think of Saddam loving the Godfather like he did?  I mean, a world leader.  All kinds of weird guys like that.  Love the Godfather, sir.  Would you ever pick up the Corleone story again?  It's done.  The masterpieces is over with part three.  It should have only been one.  Who's this fucking journalistic fucking...  They're the TMZ assholes. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, is that who it is?  Yeah, they're all trying to be stars now.  Should have just been one.  You watch TMZ?  No.  Occasionally.  Very rarely.  Harvey Levin with his stupid fucking drink and his drunk straw.  Everybody's laughing.  You know, just a real man running the office.  I would never partake in anything that shithead did.  I only watch it when it's less of a hassle to watch a shit show than it is to change the channel on Time Warner cable.  Fucking guide.  Click, click, freeze. 
[01:16:30]  Click, click, click.  Jump five spaces ahead.  Click, click, freeze.  I hate it.  Compound West.  What?  Compound West has Time Warner.  Why?  Compound East.  Oh, I see.  Because I can't get fucking Fios at Compound West.  You don't have Fios in your building?  No.  I have Fios in my building.  Holy shit.  I wish.  Amazing.  Well, I wouldn't know.  I still have Time Warner.  You haven't made this switch over.  No.  Oh, no.  You would be...  There's a fucking promised land of amazing television.  Yeah.  I love it. 
[01:17:00]  The HD channel fucking guide.  It's great.  The guide on Time Warner is like when fucking cable first started.  It sucks.  Why are you putting Harvey Levin on our list?  Because he's been on the show before, but now you say you don't want anything to do  with him with his stupid fucking drink.  Yeah.  Well, he only did our show once.  I think twice.  We weren't nice to him either.  Called in twice.  We were nice.  No, we weren't.  No?  I don't think we were particularly nice to him now.  I'm glad we weren't. 
[01:17:30]  I think I hope he was nice to him.  Were we anti-Semitic?  Hopefully.  No.  Hopefully.  Because I think he's a bit of a bottom feeder and he treated him as such.  He is.  He's not contributing.  Yeah.  Yes.  Thank you, dear.  I called him out saying, look, you're different than those other shows.  Like, you're attacking celebrities.  And then he had to try to say he's really not.  Stop.  With a sippy cup.  I thought the honesty of TMZ was pretty cool when it first started.  But then when he said, no, that's not what we're trying to do here, I'm like, all  right.  Have fun with your stupid show.  Stop it. 
[01:18:00]  Just, you know, own what you are.  It's a tool.  Are we good?  We're good.  Speaking of own.  Yeah.  Stupid fat Oprah is still on the list.  Oh.  I don't even know her.  I just, I just see how the company drops everything for someone like that.  And she, she could care.  Is it couldn't care less or care less?  Technically, she couldn't care less.  She couldn't care less.  She doesn't even know this place exists.  But if you couldn't care less, that means that there's no way you could possibly care  less than you do.  I could care less. 
[01:18:30]  Well, so could I.  That's good.  And we all know what you're trying to say.  So stop fucking calling people out when they don't say you couldn't care less, right?  I don't call them out.  I'll just ask, does that mean that you could or couldn't?  Oh, Jimmy.  I love it.  Are we done with our burning bridges segment of the program?  I know.  It's like burning embers.  I love it.  No, it's not.  I love how I was able to drag you guys into this world.  Yeah.  And admit a little, little something, something.  Jimmy, you admit a little something, something.  I just, uh.  Australian cunt. 
[01:19:00]  Own wound.  But you wanted to go to break a half hour ago and you wouldn't have burnt any bridges.  No.  Bridge intact.  Bridge intact.  Whatever.  It's just stupid at this point.  The whole thing?  Yeah, it's just stupid.  I thought it was a great segment.  What do you hate the most on that list right there?  Oh, that's a great question.  Australian fuck.  Mark the Australian fuck.  Take him out of it because he's the most.  You know, he was a long shot when this segment started, but I think I might be with you, man.  Because that's real shit right there.  Right.  That's the most egregious sort of. 
[01:19:30]  That's real.  Stop stealing my word from before.  Yes, you did.  It was in my head.  Yes.  The first time Sam thought egregious, he thought it was Greg spelled wrong.  If he was off the list, it would have to be.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I just feel sorry for him.  More than the one that attacked us the first day?  Who attacked us the first day?  Twat.  Oh, Twat.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you know what?  He's just a grump. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, you know why?  Because Twat didn't know us from a hole in the wall.  Okay.  Fuck him.  Fair enough.  Pharrell went from being a friend to being an ass fuck.  Hans Italian is coming out.  Yeah.  And so on the loyalty.  Yeah.  That loyalty is important.  Hey.  Mingy.  I feel sorry for him.  He felt like he needed to do that.  Yeah.  Pretty sad.  Should have, like, just realized he had some talent there.  I'm sorry.  I'll swear by.  He is talented, you know. 
[01:20:30]  Really?  Yeah, he is.  I never understood one thing he said when he used to call into the show.  Hey, what did you think about the games yesterday?  Hey, what was the score?  Oh, God.  Just go around in circles with that fucking guy.  I don't get it.  Whoa, he's full of energy.  Who cares? 
[01:21:00]  We used to go to breakfast with him.  We had the same agent.  And then all of a sudden, like, out of nowhere, I'm like, what are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing?  Fuck him.  Fuck him in his ass.  All right, we got Warrior shit to play after the break-in.  Warrior.  We got Herman Cain shit.  We got the Occupy Toronto guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be honest.  I have not heard this.  He should stick his head in gravy, wash it off with a bubblegum, and send it to the Navy.  Are we doing some music this show, too?  No, no, not that.  Burning Embers?  We don't have time for that. 
[01:21:30]  SFP.  SFP?  It's like fucking puppies.  Is that what that stands for?  What does that stand for?  It's great.  It's like fucking puppies.  We also got Bernie Fiennes' wife.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Brutal.  Keep your mouth shut, lady.  I'm warning you.  You want to sing a song to break?  No, it's just too heavy.  Oh, here's the song.  Magoobies this weekend.  In Baltimore.  Five shows happening.  And there won't be no more. 
[01:22:00]  It's just good.  Let's sing my thing.  Great plug.  I lost my temper when I got my bonus, and I guess I said a few things I shouldn't have.  Bonus?  How did you get a bonus?  I cut out bonuses this year.  Yeah, and thanks for telling us.  I've gotten a Christmas bonus every year but this one.  You don't want to get bonuses?  Fine.  But when people count on them as part of their salary, oh, what you did is just plain...  Sucks.  Thank you, Russ.  It's on.  Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me.

[01:23:00]  There's someone who's playing a deadly game.  I gotta tell you, man, most people wouldn't have stopped for a stranger.  The good Lord puts different things in one's path every day.  What?  There's always things happening around me ever since I was young.  Not good things, you know.  I'm scared a lot, I'm scared.  I'm scared of the dark, too, but I go out there.  Prepare for the thrill ride of a lifetime.  40,000 Americans a year die on the highways of America.

[01:40:00]  on his hands  situation room  a third woman  is about to come out  and make some serious  accusations  against him  uh by the way  i didn't hear this audio  by the way  yeah  uh 13 years  lots of text messages  lots of phone calls  she's she's showing her uh  her um  cell phone bill  oh really  and basically saying  see this number  that's him  oh that's him  and this calls from  middle of the night  white woman  um  she a white woman  what is that 
[01:40:30]  she's either  she's very nondescript  she's either  light skinned black  or jewish  that is weird  you can't really tell  with her  but i would say  white woman  ethnically ambiguous  yeah like you  that's right  she has a weird uh  i guess  hairdo  she's got that  dikey hairdo  i guess this website  wants everyone to know  that fox 5 news  has the picture  yeah they put fox 5  watermark over the  entire picture  one two three four  eight twelve  twelve watermarks  over this picture 
[01:41:00]  how'd you do that  so fast  what count  one two three  four one two three  times  just go  go across and then  down  you do rose  of course  everyone knows  you do rose  yeah  we all know  the first two women  accusing you of  sexual harassment  what can you tell us  about this third woman  it's true  oh  it's all true  he sinks himself  doesn't  listen what he says  here  he's not very good  on his feet there  when it comes to  these things  who is about to go  public and accuse  you of what 
[01:41:30]  this particular  individual  which will be  named in the story  as we understand  it  my attorney  has talked  with the reporter  who's going to  come out with this  story  this individual  is going to  accuse me  of an affair  for an extended  period of time  I don't want to  specify because  I don't know  what's in the story  secondly  it is someone  that I know  who is an acquaintance  that I thought  was a friend  that much I do  know  but other than  that wolf  when we dealt  with the previous 
[01:42:00]  allegations  and  there's too many  previous allegations  like he's talking  there's too many  previous allegations  that's all this guy's  about right now  I tweeted last night  I'm starting to think  Herman King wants to be  president for the chicks  for the pussy  for the pussy  I loves the pussy  ah pussy  he came out with a book  in 2001  and he signed it  for her  and he wrote  friends are forever  everything else  is a bonus  alright  the everything else  means his cock  his dick  in her  his dick  yeah  Herman King

[01:43:00]  those are all the details  that I have  now  give him that  how about  she's accusing you  of having an affair  you know that  so instead of backpedaling  yes or no  did you or didn't you  right  or I don't want to answer that  don't say  you need more information  before you can respond  you're the guy  you're the guy  you're the guy  in the story  you know already  you know  what a clown  oh this guy  he sunk himself  holy shit  because he knows  my humble opinion  he knows it's true 
[01:43:30]  and he's trying to  see if he can skate  yes he does  he's trying to skate  all of the details  that I have  now  given that  I know that  the court of public opinion  is going to formulate  its own opinion  formulate  I can't control  people who are going  to make a decision  based upon  accusations  when specifics  are made  through my attorney  because  we are trying  to run a campaign  I'm a lawyer  we are trying  to connect  with the people  on the issues  through my attorney  we will respond  to every detail  and every allegation

[02:00:00]  one out  and it's  just not  going  no  not at all  it's  it's  it's  it's  like you  get a  push  and it  feels  like there's  a fucking  a shit  boomerang  facing like  the curve  side down  and it's  like there's  no way  this is  happening  yeah it's  a tough  one  I know  why  I know  why Fez  is crying  in that clip  come on  now it's  just blatant  I just  know  I mean  you know  he's sad  because you  know  his dad  left the  books  laying around  the streets  oh  no  you didn't  I'm not  even  touching  this  he 
[02:00:30]  he  he had  him  laying  in the  streets  so Fez  knew  I'm not  even  touching  this  oh my god  that was  that's bad  I'm not  even  so Fez  could find  the books  we all  know that  and then  Fez  found the  books  that his  father  left  laying  around  and he  built a  library  and now  they took  the library  away  I don't  listen to  Ron and  Fez  because I'm  usually  like I  take my  nap  at that  hour  but is  is this  going to  be a  problem  no  yes  it will  why would  it be  a  problem  well  it's the  second  time 
[02:01:00]  that  you brought  him up  you brought  him up  about an  hour ago  and this  time  this is  much too  much  bringing  up  yeah  I mean  and this  time  was  not a  good  analogy  well  I mean  Fez  admitted  that he  finds  what  change  is it  that his  father  leaves  for him  put it  this  way  I've  seen  compliments  be  misconstrued  into a  problem  what happened  I've seen  what happened  yeah I've  seen nothing  but goodness  twisted and 
[02:01:30]  turned  into badness  you're throwing  out badness  I'm  I'm throwing  slight  things out  there  this is worse  than when the  Stangle brothers  attacked him  oh no  did they attack  him  yeah they're  evil  they are  what happened  fucking evil  they really are  that Justin  Stangle  I was on Fez  that day  because there's  two of them  he called  them up like  Irish brothers  he called  up Ron  and Fez  when Opie  was on  and I'm  sure his  brother was  whispering  into his  ear  and they  they upset  Fez  what'd they  say  well they 
[02:02:00]  thought we  were in  cahoots  together  to get  Fez  to cry  because Opie  went out  of his  way  to ask  Fez  what character  he would  play in  Batman  which I  thought was  a great  question  what's wrong  with that  question  why are you  instigating  he thought  I brought  it up  to make  him cry  to this day  I'm very  confused by  that  honestly why  would he cry  if I had  to play  I would  probably play  the Joker  better than  Heath Legger  why are you  talking about  this  I don't get  it  it's gonna  be a 
[02:02:30]  nightmare  I like  Fez  he always  seems happy  when I see  him  not a nightmare  if you just  turn off the  radio and go  about your  day  I don't know  what happens  this is  must listen  must listen  it comes  on at 11  now  what  11 is when  Ron Fez  starts  I thought it  was noon  no  it's noon  noon at 3  it's 11 to 3  what  it's right  after the  after show  I don't  listen  they have  to do  an extra  hour  when did  that happen  probably  at least  two years  ago  I listen  all the time  I don't know  why I said  noon  I have no  idea  I can guess 
[02:03:00]  because you're  stupid  maybe because  Ronnie lets  that song play  for an hour  what's the song  get to the  fucking show  what's the song  either that  or dead air  first  oh no  no  it's  North  American  Scum  yeah  hey there  buddies  let the record  show by the way  that Jimmy gave  Ann a nice  trashing there  and he's  fine  it's a good song 
[02:03:30]  we should start  opening the  Opie and Anthony  show with the  song  866  run  zero  fez  you alright  buddy  is that the  number  you alright  buddy  and this will  just go on  and on  after a  blues song  that's  usually the  extended version 
[02:04:00]  look  I'm not  faulting him  we do the  same  god damn  thing  we play  ecstasy  of gold  every fucking  morning  Ronnie's  reading the  room  seeing what  he's got  for the  day  he's a  brilliant man  he's reading  the room  seeing what  he's got  in front of  him  oh my god  wow  it's gonna be  a rough one  are you having  a standalone  fruit with your  yogurt  what  blueberry  oh 
[02:04:30]  yeah  okay look  now see  I'm getting  roped into this  you just  entered enemy  territory  no I'm  totally kidding  why bring up  the blueberry  thing  that was  uncomfortable  you think so  I do  let's not  let's not  talk and  have people  think it's  later than  it is  see  let's just  make them  think it's  the Ron and  Fez show  I don't mean  not talk like  that  I mean  I meant  if we don't  talk they  will think  they won't

[02:09:00]  would you like to have him in here to talk  why can't we get him on the show  he seems like he would be great on the show  I'd be so exciting if he was in here  maybe he will come in if he needs to promote a show  either him or Virgil  Virgil  Virgil  are you happy that Virgil signed your thing  Iroh  I thought that was great  no  he signed Iroh's million dollar belt  that would literally be like if I got Sabbath to sign something and when I wasn't looking  the guy who was playing session keyboards came over and signed it  like ah  what the fuck  oh stupid Virgil ruined your million dollar belt  there's a t-shirt I really want to get with a picture of Virgil in white 
[02:09:30]  and under it  on red  with white letters  it just says FML  which stands for  fuck my life  fuck my life  Jesus  stupid Virgil  that sucks  Virgil's an ass  sitting at his empty table  nobody wants a soccer  nobody  FML  oh god  no it's not FML  they're good  they're gonna tort us  what's their name  fuck my life  oh okay  Iroh 
[02:10:00]  can you get a message to Ronnie for me  sure  I just gotta get a message to you  tell him I'm uh  leaving him low spark of high-heeled boys  just in case he needs it today  what is that  a very long song  oh no  oh come on  why would you leave him a long song  he's like  live in memory of Elizabeth Reed  yeah or that one would work  just in case he needs extra time to read the room today  oh boy  what do you mean  how long is low spark of high-heeled boys  uh  this one by Steve Winwood 
[02:10:30]  is 18 minutes  oh  that's a  that's a good song  it's never good when you have to explain your dumb joke that you set up yourself  do you like Steve Winwood  uh no  I think he's terrible  oh my god  he had a hell of a career  and I saw him a couple times  in Rochester  and uh  Higher Love  I mean he had a  I hate that song  poppy songs  yeah  it's been around forever  and a bunch of  bands  what kind of prize is that  yeah  to win wood  oh god 
[02:11:00]  listen to the beginning of this  the beginning  the intro goes on forever  I used to love this song  takes forever  fucking hideous  forever  sounds like  sounds like bad company  we're at 17 minutes  it's a traffic song  this is actually  a good song  I love this song  I don't mind this song  for a moment 
[02:11:30]  I like traffic  yeah  for a moment  they had a few hits  is that photoshopped  no  come on  that's photoshopped  it has to be  we're looking at a picture  of Virgil  in the middle of  nowhere  behind his dumb table  he's squinting  like he's in the sun  that's hilarious  it might be  yeah  there's cars parked  there might be a wrestling event  and he's outside  with nobody  going to his table  oh my god  alright  we gotta get the warrior  on our show 
[02:12:00]  I would love to have  the warrior on our show  you'd turn it down  at the chorus  sorry  I didn't know  you still wanted it  no I didn't  we have 16 and a half minutes  still  is that a photoshop  you think  that's not a photoshop  the parking lot  I don't think so  no  I don't think it is  really  did somebody just  take a bunch of pictures  let's see the parking lot one  come on  and you're good at this  I know  I don't think it is  because look at the shadowing  yeah but you could put that in  look at the squinting though  his face is squinting  into the sun 
[02:12:30]  they may have just  but what they may have done  is copied that  from a place where he was outdoors  and just put it there  like there may have been  people around or whatever  why would you set up a booth  in the middle of a road  it's a parking lot  maybe he's right outside  maybe they were doing  an outdoor fan fest  before an indie show  in a gym  I don't  I believe it  because where's Ted  he always has that banner up  whether Ted DiBiase  shows up or not  yeah yeah  he's just gotta have the name  it doesn't matter  if the million dollar man  is there  he puts it on the banner 
[02:13:00]  he's got the one banner  is he a superstar  no  does Ted DiBiase hate  that he's associated  with Virgil still  Ted DiBiase is there  for some of the shows  yeah  and he can bring in  some people  yeah  Virgil  no one  the shadows are very  they're really good  good  because they're all  going in the right direction  I think it was an outside shot  that they just put there  I don't think so  we're wasting time  and look at the shadowing  on the floor  and the shadow on the pedestrian  is the same direction  it's the same angle  it's real  so it's either a really good 
[02:13:30]  photoshopped  or he's that pathetic  wow he is  why am I arguing  the fact that he would be  in a parking lot  of course he's fucking sad  because it's more horrific  than we could have imagined  it is true  you think something's bad  we gotta take a break  because we got Gary Oldman  coming in  and we definitely want to do  the Bernie Fine wife audio  and we want to do the preview  from the Warriors new show  we have to do these two things today  they're both terrific  they're not cool  and then Gary Oldman  he's got a new movie  that's a real star  you got another song to break 
[02:14:00]  wait  it's not finished  it's just starting like  I know you say  that we're some sick motherfuckers  because we're as cold  as the ice road truckers  and when we come to your town  the shit goes down  with the sick  the sick  the sick  fucking puppies  the sick  the sick  the sick  fucking puppies  barking up your tree  attention anglers 
[02:14:30]  still convinced  that fishing is a sport  well  renowned sportsman  James Norton  presents the ultimate cure  for your delusion  how smart do you have to be  to beat this animal  psychologically  what a dumb animal  the fish is  introducing  fishing is not a sport  you douche  not a sport  it's not a sport  go in the water  with your fists  and punch the fish  that's a sport  you're standing in a  fucking boat  it's not a sport  you have a hook  and the fish  has nothing but hunger  this collection  is presented on 
[02:15:00]  nine full length  high fidelity  audio cassettes  and will thoroughly  convince you  that your leisure  activity is a  colossal waste of time  you and some other  jizz bucket  and fucking waders  and a big gut  standing there  in ten degree water  drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon  trying to hook  some asshole fish  you're not a sportsman  you're not out there  sporting  despite what you may think  fishing is not  a battle of wits  it's not stacked equally  between a dumb  fucking fish  who has been doing  the same thing  since dinosaurs  were shitting  all over Manhattan  you understand 
[02:15:30]  that fish was no  smarter when a  tyrannosaurus was  shitting on 70th Street  and Broadway  put down that  stupid fishing pole  and pick up your  copies of  fishing is not a sport  you douche  narrated by  James Norton  I'm just letting you  know  you're not a  sportsman  you got your  good boy bone  and your  naughty boy bone  your naughty boy bone  and your good boy bone 
[02:16:00]  and your naughty boy bone  your naughty boy bone  and your good boy bone  Fuck, I know this. 
[02:16:30]  You know what?  Green Day?  Sounds like Green Day.  Green Day.  Oh, yeah.  I used to like these guys.  Still kind of a guilty pleasure to me.  You like the Green Day?  Not everything, but I like their old stuff.  And a couple of their newer things are still weird.  You know, I'm not going to be one of those,  anything past bloody blood sucks. 
[02:17:00]  We did a death montage in my dad's wake.  You're kidding.  And, you know, the person that put it together meant well,  and it was something to look at.  Yeah.  They used time of my life or whatever.  Oh, God.  So now I'm kind of not into Green Day.  Oh, see?  Yeah, that'll do that.  I used to like that song.  And then you realize, wait, other songs sound,  you can hear the voice, so.  Oh, wow.  That ruined it for you.  I felt like I had to explain it,  because we started out being friends with Green Day. 
[02:17:30]  But it's a little rough to have the death montage with one of their songs,  and then just go about, uh...  Goddamn death dedication.  Hi.  How's that song go?  Give me a little piece if you want to see tears in my eyes.  Oh, no.  I don't want to see that.  Through your tears.  What?  What?  Only one guy's allowed to cry on this channel?  I knew it was...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Oh.  No, no, no. 
[02:18:00]  I can't do this.  They also used this for the end of Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Did they really?  Yeah, right before the final episode,  they did a whole montage of all the seasons with this.  This song is that old?  20 years ago, I came out of Cineport, New York.  With a dream to become a radio star.  And then you can't show.  It's not a question.  It's still real to me.  Where the whore's at?  I don't know how.  Harry McCain got in this motherfucker. 
[02:18:30]  I got up in this motherfucker.  I'm going to bust a tree.  Bust a nut up a tree.  Something.  I don't know.  Pull the bullhorn out.  I'm speaking nonsense.  Want to do Bernie Fine?  Hey, I'm warning you.  Or do you want to do Warrior?  First, can I say...  What happened?  When you're...  There's five stalls.  Oh, no.  I'm in the next to the last one.  What happened?  I'm...  I'm...  Pebble shits.  Pebble...  A fucking 11 wiper. 
[02:19:00]  Nothing.  Oh.  When it's...  It's all open.  And a guy walks in,  and this motherfucker  sits in the last stall,  which is right next to my...  What, do we have to double up down here?  There's fucking four open stalls the other way.  Tap his foot underneath the other stall.  You're an asshole.  You're going to spread that shit out.  What, do you want to smell my logs to motivate you?  What the fuck is that about?  That is kind of creepy.  What's that about?  I just saw John Walsh out there, too.  Really?  America's Most Wanted, yeah.  I'm not even going to say it.  No.  What?  How's he look?  I saw him from the back.  He's very small and thin.  He's a small guy. 
[02:19:30]  He's a petite man.  It's a very honest show today,  so fuck it.  Roland goes,  I just saw a ghost.  I'm like, what?  Because I just saw a ghost  ghost 20 minutes ago.  He should be doing this  because I can't do the Roland.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  He goes,  Richard Lewis just arrived.  What's wrong with him?  And then proceeds to go,  he looks like shit.  Oh, shit.  He says he looks really old.  Wow.  Roland's been around a while.  Yes, he has. 
[02:20:00]  Goddamn.  You like Richard Lewis?  Yes, I do.  As a comedian?  Yeah.  I mean, he's an original.  I got no opinion on it.  I like Richard,  and I worked with him once.  It was many, many, many years ago.  At Caroline's with Corey Kahaney.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like him.  I have Ivanka Trump.  I don't like her.  You do?  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  She's kind of pretty.  Wow, she looks good today.  Yeah, she's tall.  She's sitting with these Fox News people.  Yeah.  She's making them all look like midgets.  Holy fuck, she looks really good.  Usually, like, 
[02:20:30]  the space between her bottom lip  and the chin  is a little too narrow.  Yeah, yeah.  But not today, man.  She almost looks like Chip.  Like when her mouth is closed?  What's that?  Look how tall she is.  She's beautiful.  She looks great.  She's statuesque.  How tall is she, you think?  Ten feet.  No, she's just 5'4".  They're all just really tiny.  She's got to be close to six foot tall, I bet.  Probably.  Yeah, she looks really fucking good.  Yeah, she looks really good today.  Why couldn't I have married into that family?  Yeah, right.  Oh, you would have laughed at the wedding. 
[02:21:00]  Tell me, Donald, you're fired.  We don't have laughed.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Fired.  The Donald Jr. there.  He's still saying he's not going to, you know, he might run for solid.  The junior Donald is fucking tweeting my chick all the time.  Really?  How do I compete with that?  Donald Trump Jr.?  I'm like, oh, I got a big house.  I got, oh, yeah.  Okay.  Donald Trump Jr.  You got a big cock.  That's all that matters.  Ah, please.  Donald Trump Jr. is cool as shit, man.  He should do our show again.  I like him a lot.  He's not afraid to tweet some funny shit. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I like him.  If it's politically incorrect.  Are they both talking to me?  She had Donald Suns, both of them?  Oh, she got, yeah.  That one looks just like him.  She's got access to a billion dollars.  You'd tweet whatever the fuck you want.  He came out of the womb with fuck you money.  Imagine that.  Yeah.  Fuck you money right down the flue.  Must be nice.  Right out of the pipe.  Must be fucking nice.  Oh.  How do you motivate yourself, though?  Really?  No, I'm not even kidding.  I wouldn't do anything.  Huh?  You wouldn't do anything?  I wouldn't do anything.  No!  I'd watch TV and play video games. 
[02:22:00]  That's what I do anyway.  What am I talking about?  It's all I do.  All right.  What do you want to do?  We're going to have Gary Oldman come in here, and we're not going to get to this goodness  in front of us.  Let's start with Bernie Fiennes' wife, because I really do want to hear that.  Get my dick nice and hard.  The warrior's going to wait until tomorrow.  No!  I'm telling you right now.  Nah, this will go up.  So Bernie Fiennes' wife there did a little phone interview.  Yeah.  And just threw her husband under the bus.  Did she mean to?  No.  No, she was talking.  She was recorded talking to the kid, the victim.  Right!  The victim.  So who recorded who? 
[02:22:30]  The victim recorded her.  Illegally?  No, it was legal because of the state.  Did he get an Australian mark to wiretap?  For him?  No.  Some of those states allow the one-sided recording.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yes.  And this is one of them.  All right, here we go.  Well, what did he want you to do?  You might be honest with me.  What do you think?  What do you want me to do?  What, do you want you to grab him?  Oh, he's trying to make me, so he's trying to make me grab him. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, he was like, my first one, he grabbed me and they're, you know, touching me.  But you never had any oral sex with him?  No.  I think he would have, but...  Oh, of course he would.  Why would he?  Oh, that's the wife?  That's his wife talking like that?  Yes.  How fucked up is this situation where your wife is asking a boy if your husband had oral  sex with him?  Wait a minute.  It's easy to throw the wife under the bus.  Is it?  Her husband is a boy cock jerker. 
[02:23:30]  Yes.  I feel for her.  Yeah, she's had enough.  The man she fucking committed her life to is allegedly jerking kids off in the vehicle.  What, is she supposed to be loyal?  Stand by William Frawley while he jerks the whole team off?  Fuck him.  Hey, Rick, I'm going to give a handjob.  Well.  Wow.  But she's not bothered by it.  No.  No, that's just it.  Of course he would.  It's the very matter-of-fact way she's talking about.  Well, of course he'd want to suck the boy's dick. 
[02:24:00]  Yes, of course he would.  Amanda from New Jersey.  I have no idea.  I'm just going to read this.  She admits that she also had a part in screwing him up as well.  Wait, wait.  Sorry.  A new one came in.  Please don't forget to mention that this woman also had sex with this accuser when he turned 18.  Wait, the wife did?  Is that true?  It's in the audio, yeah.  The wife fucked him?  Oh, yeah.  That's why that's part of her saying, of course he would.  It's because she also is a fan of that dick. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Let's hear more.  Let's turn in cane fit in all this.  Bernie's wife says she knows everything.  Everything!  Oh, Gary Oldman.  I know everything that went on.  You know, I know everything that went on with him.  Bernie has issues.  Maybe that he's not aware of, but he has issues.  And you trusted somebody you shouldn't have trusted.  Yeah.  Bernie is also in denial.  I think that he did the things he did, but he somehow through his own mental telepathy has erased him out of his mind. 
[02:25:00]  Just wait a minute.  Let me ask you.  So now, here's the allegations.  It's alleged that she fucked the 18-year-old?  Amanda saying out loud, yes, she did.  But does Bernie know or not know?  I think he might not care.  Was it a threesome?  No, no.  It wasn't a threesome.  Would one of these fucking coaches just commit suicide already?  That'd be great.  He's getting over with.  Wow, she fucked him. 
[02:25:30]  And the husband jerked him off.  How great is this kid's cock?  I know.  Bernie's wife says there were other people.  The victim talks about a time Bernie's wife saw what happened.  Ooh.  Hey, Bernie.  I think I'm the only one I've ever done that to.  No.  I think there might have been others, but it was dear truth.  There was something about you.  I'm wondering why I was the worst one now.  One time she told me about an instance where she saw him through the basement window.  And she left the blinds open a little bit one night. 
[02:26:00]  And she's acting like she's taking the guard out, but she watched through the window.  What did she see?  Bernie's all grabbing me and touching me.  And she said the next day, you know, Bobby, you got to do something.  This is when I was a little bit older.  Probably like a junior year in high school.  Looks like Roland.  Hold on.  Pause this for a second, please.  You got to say something.  You got to be a man.  What the fuck is he doing allowing that when he's a junior and senior in high school?  When you're a little kid, that's one thing.  But get the fuck out of here after a certain time.  Oh, Jimmy, you're blaming the victim.  I am, in a way.  Not when he was a little kid. 
[02:26:30]  But when you're 27, you were still letting him jerk you off.  You look like Randy Couture, first of all.  Go fuck yourself.  This kid, it went until he was in his early 20s.  Yeah, I really feel bad for a guy in 23 getting jerked off by a fat guy against his will.  You poor victim.  I'm going to come.  Old man fucking knuckles.  I agree with Jimmy on this one.  17 or 18.  Get the fuck out of here.  Unless he's raping you.  Come on.  No.  Come on.  Please.  I'm with you on this one.  It seems like the, quote, victim was a willing participant. 
[02:27:00]  Just as long as he had a hand around his dick.  Right?  The victim talked about Bernie wanting something after he gave him money for a student loan.  When he gave you the money, what did he want for that?  He wanted you to grab or he wanted to do you?  He wanted to do me.  Well, he wanted me to do a chip too.  He tried to make me to a chip a couple of times.  He grabbed my hand and then go away.  And then he put me in your bed and then, you know, put me down.  And I'll try to go away.  And he put his arm up my chest.  He goes, if you want this money, I'll stay here, you know. 
[02:27:30]  Right, right.  He just has a fancy attitude because he didn't give his money nor can he get what he wanted.  He didn't get the money.  It's about the dick.  You know that.  The dick.  If you're just telling you for your own good, you're better off just staying away from him.  Oh, really?  Now that he's almost 30?  Good advice, lady.  Exactly.  You just take your pilot's license and fly somewhere.  When did this start?  How old was he?  Seven, supposedly.  This is not the one.  This is not the first one.  This is the next one.  How old was this guy when it started? 
[02:28:00]  When Bernie Fine was yanking his pud.  All right, 12 is a little rough.  That's young, yeah.  All right.  Now, see, he might have done something to him where,  even into his 20s, he's so fucked up in the head.  Yeah.  If you don't know by the time you're 18 to stop letting him grab your dick, it annoys me.  What if it damaged him psychologically?  Really?  And he wasn't able to refuse this guy.  Yeah, well, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you made the same decisions when you were 22.  Sorry you still got your fucking dick hard when you were 22. 
[02:28:30]  Why is your pud standing straight up like a soldier?  Yeah.  Bernie's wife says Bernie needs to find gay boys, then admits she had sex with the victim  as well.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  Go to a place where there's a gay boy.  Find yourself a gay boy.  You know, get your wraps off.  You have to be over with.  Okay.  You know, he just needs a male championship, man.  I can't give him nor is he interested in me, and vice versa.  At one point, Lori Fine seems to say that her husband was not the only adult in the fine 
[02:29:00]  household who betrayed Davis' trust.  Doesn't sound like a fine household to me.  He had no business doing what he did with you.  You know what?  Leave it at it because I really helped screw you up a little more, too.  But Davis says he and Lori Fine had a sexual relationship that she initiated when he says  he was 18 and a senior in high school. 
[02:29:30]  Were you ever with her sexually?  Yes.  Slept with her?  Yes.  Had intercourse with her?  Yes.  Does Bernie Fine know about that?  I did tell Bernie.  This is as I got older.  Like, when I was a kid, I thought he was going to kill me, but I just had to tell him.  And I felt like, and I told him about it, you know, what was going on with me and Lori.  And it didn't faze him one bit, honestly.  I hate this guy, and I also hate Bernie and his wife.  All three of them are hateable.  Yeah.  The victim wouldn't have been hateable if he had just done something.  But, you know, first of all, how could he fuck these ugly people? 
[02:30:00]  This guy's got a dick of steel.  Yeah, she's not quite the looker over there.  She's fucking terrible, and that's a glamour shot.  That's a Mellie hair.  Yeah.  That's like, yeah, from a wedding or something.  They say Bernie thought he was above the law.  I said to him, um, you know, Bobby and I talked, I know some things about you that  if you keep pushing, are going to be let out.  He was pushing.  Didn't even push.  I know, that's what I'm saying.  He said, here, let him go ahead. 
[02:30:30]  Here, let him go right ahead.  He doesn't think he could be through.  He thinks that, I think he thinks he's above the law.  It's a weird one.  Yeah, that's just a weird, twisted kind of situation.  It was rough, obviously, and you think it fucked him up, or?  I don't know.  I think Jimmy's right, you know.  You're fucking reaching into your 20s, and you're still fucking getting jerked off by  some old dude.  That's pretty bad.  Yeah.  How do you, like, when you're like, when you feel the breath coming, and your fucking  cum is just aching to fucking, to peruse, to meander over those old fat knuckles. 
[02:31:00]  You think that's what happened?  You jerked him to completion?  And Bernie would tug a little harder, and he'd probably squeeze, I bet as the guy came,  He was a squeeze?  After the guy came, Bernie would probably squeeze the bass, and the head would swell and get  redder, and he would shake it, and then the last of the cum would go, like a dog shaking  the water off. 
[02:31:30]  Fucking, in your early 20s, still being molested, really, are you, sir?  Yeah.  Fuck out of here.  I'm fucking the wife and shit.  Yeah, come on, stop it.  Oh, this accuser's been charged with molestation as well?  Himself, yeah.  Oh, great.  Great guy.  Mop citizen.  I think.  Feds are involved, though.  Got the feds involved.  Feds?  I thought you said Feds for a second.  Oh.  The feds.  Oh, sorry.  I heard. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Troublemaker.  Oh, good God.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm yawning.  Oh, yawning.  If the Feds was involved, would he really be involved?  See that?  That just got blatant right there.  That's blatant.  So blatant.  Oh, boy.  Hey, why don't we move on to Warrior?  I want to hear the Warrior.  Warrior.  Warrior's ears.  Warrior show.  So what's this about? 
[02:32:30]  I don't know anything about this one, Sam.  Well, apparently, aside from it being fantastic, the Warrior's going to get a new show.  It seems like it's on the internet.  And the Twitterverse went a little crazy for this video last night.  Look at all the likes.  Yeah, and I think what it is is...  He's a scary motherfucker, isn't he?  Well, wait till you see this.  You think he's tough?  Yeah, he comes off as tough.  We should just play it off of the air.  It's only a minute 37.  Yeah.  And you get the... 
[02:33:00]  You gotta...  Yeah.  It's like a motivational program.  Right.  It's a motivational program.  He takes this band.  It's this band called Asking Alexandria.  And he's going to shake them up.  Isn't it used to be called Sick Fucking Puppies?  You gotta bring down the establishment.  The establishment.  You gotta bring down the establishment.  Wow.  He gets political.  Not bad.  Yeah, it's great.  So that's his political number.  Yeah, it's good.  I hate it. 
[02:33:30]  I hate how you repeat things over and over.  Chip stinks.  You don't like Sick Fucking Puppies?  No, I hate Sick Fucking Puppies.  All right, let's...  Okay.  That's...  Coming soon.  The Warrior Show.  This is still a workout.  I'm Warrior.  They're drinking.  Hey, Danny.  Danny, nice to meet you.  Hello, mate, Ben.  Ben, nice to meet you.  Girls, you gotta find something else to do.  I just need the guys.  Come on, let's go.  What is that?  Whiskey or wine? 
[02:34:00]  Wine.  Show me that you can drink half the bottle.  I'm not gonna chug the whole thing.  It's gonna last me.  You know what?  Through the workout?  You gonna run in those fucking cowboy boots, John Wayne?  You drank a bottle of fucking wine.  That is fucking disrespectful to me, you motherfucker.  Heavy.  Holy shit.  He's right in his face.  Oof.  Holy shit.  How do we get involved with this project?  Oh, this guy's fantastic.  Is it too late?  You motherfucker.  If only he'd cut promos like this.  Oh, right? 
[02:34:30]  Look at the neck on him.  Look at the neck on that guy.  That's steroids, right, Sam?  Well, he's not drug tested anymore, that's for sure.  Mm-hmm.  Let's go.  You motherfucker.  Heavy fucking metal!  Here's some fucking heavy metal for ya!  They're dragging weights, and they got chains around their necks.  I like your fucking ideas about creating your own freedom.  I'll support you all the way on that.  If you know what you're doing in your life, you fucking indulge in the things you do,  you're putting fucking chains around your neck.  You're weighting yourself down.  One shot, that's all you get. 
[02:35:00]  You will never get that fucking second back.  Maybe you are the chosen one!  Danny, you wanna be a fucking monster?  Be it body, mind, and soul.  I saw that fucking belly, rip that fucking gut into an 8-pack.  Looked like a fucking god up there.  When I was in high school, I was just a punk kid, man.  I stumbled into the weight room one day.  Fucking changed my life forever.  You have it in you, man.  Come on.  Come on, man.  You can do it.  Good job.  I want you to be the best in the fucking world.  I want you to prove all those fucking idiot haters wrong. 
[02:35:30]  If you really want to,  then you're gonna have to pay a price.  The Warrior is out of his mind.  It's the greatest show ever.  It's fantastic.  But why this band?  Why is he motivating this band?  Because they need motivation.  And why do they need 8-packs to come up with cool songs that we'll enjoy?  Because you need to look like a god up there.  Fucking gods.  Oh, I see.  How do you not understand The Warrior?  He's so literal.  He goes, you know, figuratively, he was saying, 
[02:36:00]  it's like chains around your neck.  Those things you do.  And then he literally put chains around their necks  and made them walk and do squats with big iron chains on them.  You see, Anthony,  sometimes we don't feel the weight of our decisions  until we literally feel the weight of those decisions.  And Warrior knows this.  What's the backstory, though?  There is no backstory.  How does he know this band?  He wanted to do a TV show.  It's some band called...  Find Me Band!  Asking Alexandria.  That's probably what he said. 
[02:36:30]  I like the motivational aspect of the whole thing.  But why this band?  Because they're fucking all...  They're drinking.  They're showing up on stage.  Asking Alexandria.  Does anyone know who they are?  Well, they're not like a big band.  What's he going to get?  Are they in the system?  What?  Eric says he can't fight.  I'm saying no.  No, okay.  All right.  Can we get him on the show, The Warrior?  I'm going to try with all my might, too.  Where does he live?  He used to live in Queens, actually.  I think now he lives in Arizona.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Well, AZ up in that mouth. 
[02:37:00]  That's right.  Can we call him right now?  I don't have his phone number.  Someone's got to have it.  Herman Kings?  Look up Warrior in the phone book.  Warrior.  Warrior.  That's his real name.  He changed it to Warrior.  He legally had it, because he wanted to, it was over copyrights, because obviously Vince  McMahon didn't want to give him shit.  Ultimate Warrior.  So he legally changed his name to Warrior.  What about the Ultimate part?  He couldn't have that.  Could he be first name Ultimate, last name Warrior?  No. 
[02:37:30]  Why?  He's got one name.  That seems weird.  Why isn't he allowed to have Ultimate?  I don't know.  But his name is just Warrior, and his kids, he has like two kids, I think?  At least, their last names are Warrior.  Really?  The kids' names.  That's kind of a cool last name.  Did he name one of them Ultimate?  As a kid.  I don't think he named either one of them Ultimate, no.  That's too bad.  How about All and Timit?  Yeah, or I'm Nada.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  How about first name All, Timit, his middle name.  Timit, because that sounds like Timid Warrior.  No, Timit.  No, you put it all together, Sam.  That's Timit Warrior. 
[02:38:00]  That's just to get around the Vince McMahon angle.  Right.  I see.  So you don't have to pay Vince for your own name.  No.  It's like the drummer in my band, his name is Warlord.  Oh, God.  What a hacky fucking contrived piece of shit band, Chip.  Especially since Vince McMahon already owns the copyright on Warlord.  Because there was a wrestler named The Warlord.  The Warlord.  Boy, Vince owns everything.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Wow.  Ultimate Warrior is Gary Busey on steroids. 
[02:38:30]  Whoa.  Good old cigars.  I love on steroids.  Oh, my gosh.  Jokes.  They're really funny.  That's like on crack or from hell.  From hell, on crack.  Except I think this time it's literally the Ultimate Warrior uses steroids.  He uses anabolic steroids.  Does he?  I mean, listen, he's not drug tested anymore and the guy is gigantic.  He doesn't have to be.  Exactly.  He's a citizen.  He might work out a lot.  That's his business.  Yeah, we don't know what he does.  What he does is his business.  Exactly.  Right, Sam.  What are you trying to get in trouble?  It's his beeswax.  I'm not trying to get you in trouble.  Hey, you guys remember Jordan from...  I do.  You do?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Jordan?  From the party.  Oh, I am?  Oh, karaoke guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sweet Caroline guy.  He went to the country, yes.  He was supposed to sing for us.  What happened to that?  He didn't show up to the studio.  He didn't show up to the studio.  He didn't show up.  He's been on the line for two days.  Straight?  No joke.  He's been on hold for two days.  Back me up.  Yeah.  He was on hold the entire show yesterday.  Whole show yesterday.  And he's been on hold three hours already today.  Yeah.  That's no joke.  That's seven straight hours on hold. 
[02:39:30]  I just got a phone number that might be the warrior's phone number.  What?  All right.  Call it.  Okay.  We're huge fans.  No joke.  I'm a huge fan of this guy.  Huge.  Wow.  Look at you.  Why are you calling it?  He's going to come in his pants.  Yeah.  Hello.  Do it right here.  Hello.  Yes.  Why are you fucking calling me?  One-sided conversation.  We're allowed to do that.  If he's in Arizona, fuck, have it six in the morning.  Jordan might have to wait a little longer.  Did you fuck Hulk Hogan's wife?  Warrior?  Hello?  Comment. 
[02:40:00]  Eureka-choo.  Eureka-choo.  Eureka-choo.  Eureka-choo.  Eureka-choo.  Eureka-choo.  I'll be fucking white women.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Jordan?  What happened to Jordan?  Oh, you want him now?  No.  I thought the phone was plunked down on him.  Well, if we got the warrior, we get the warrior.  Oh, that's true.  What's going on?  I'm giving the other rules.  Oh, that's good, Jordan.  So, Jordan, what did he do again?  Sweet Caroline at our live broadcast Thanksgiving. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Then he was supposed to come in Thanksgiving morning to sing for us.  Right, to sing.  Gave him the address, and I don't know if he showed up.  No.  Jordan?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Jordan.  That worked out well.  Boy, that whole intro.  I know.  It was a good intro, Sam.  It was great.  It was one of my better ones.  Jordan.  Yeah, Jordan.  He might be asleep.  Oh, Jordan.  Hello, Jordan.  Hey, Jordan.  All right, Jordan. 
[02:41:00]  Jordan.  Hey, Jordan.  I heard he got mugged or something.  Sam?  Yeah, he called in the after show yesterday.  Well, he was still on hold, I should say, for the after show yesterday.  Don't tell me what happened, because maybe he'll call back.  Okay.  But I'm hearing he got mugged.  And what's up with the warrior thing?  Wow.  What the fuck happened?  Well, we had three things that were going on tentatively.  We're in a roundabout right now.  Tentatively.  And they didn't pan out.  Are they called roundabouts?  Yeah.  Yes.  That's what my British GPS voice calls it. 
[02:41:30]  Turn at the roundabout.  Ew.  No, it doesn't.  It does, actually.  When I use the British voice, the roundabout.  Why do you use the British voice?  Why wouldn't you?  It sounds like there's a smart gal with me.  Hubba hubba.  I would tell my girlfriend all the time, I'd kick you in a pussy if this girl go out with me.  Yeah.  Apparently, warrior had some financial troubles at one point.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't want to get into his exact figures, but there was some debt that had to be settled.  Oh. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Did he go bankrupt or something?  No, but it's because...  Morally?  Yeah.  Certain...  Laughing at myself.  Asshole.  Yeah.  I kind of like that.  Laughing at my own horrible fucking...  Well, what do we got?  It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing and then finally picked up and it asked for  a remote access code.  What does that mean?  Boy, yeah.  It's remote access code.  That's how you check and get your messages. 
[02:42:30]  Oh.  Yeah, well.  Oh, I see.  Someone's shining you on, as they say.  Later on today, see if you can call tomorrow.  The after show.  No.  Call them on the after show.  Yeah, I get a idea.  Don't waste them on the shit show.  It's not a waste.  That's a total waste.  It's not.  You should really use the guitar solo by Demon right now.  Who's Demon?  Demon's my guitarist.  Oh.  War Lord and Demon.  And Chip.  And Chippa?  That doesn't sound right.  Do you have a stage name, Chip? 
[02:43:00]  No?  What?  He wasn't listening.  No, he was never listening.  I was going to call myself Beelzebub.  I would never see this band.  It's not tough at all.  It's horrible.  Chip should go on the Warrior show.  Yeah, he needs motivation.  Oh, the phone's a...  Is that a reward?  Oh, they're all ringing.  Oh, yeah, they're all ringing.  I thought it was Jordan calling.  We're learning more about this band asking Alexandria. 
[02:43:30]  They play the Warped Tour a lot.  Did they?  I wouldn't, I guess.  Remember that one.  I wouldn't know.  All right, what do we do?  I'd say go to the phone and just see.  Jordan was a bust, and the Warrior is not answering his phone.  What the fuck?  Sounds like we had our eggs in a couple of baskets, and both of them baskets done fell, too.  Jeff, what do you got for the show?  Hey, Chip, are you there?  Yeah, what's that?  Hey, you ought to know, there's already a band called the Sick Puppies.  They're out of Australia.  Yeah, I don't know about them. 
[02:44:00]  They're probably stealing my eyes.  I'm wearing the Sick Fucking Puppies.  Yeah, it's Sick Fucking Puppies.  The Sick, the Sick, the Sick Fucking Puppies.  The Sick, the Sick, the Sick Fucking Puppies.  The Sick, the Sick, the Sick, the Sick Fucking Puppies barking up your tree.  I hate the repeating.  Chip, you got to get more words.  I got the one about the ice road truckers with sick motherfuckers.  Shit goes down when we come to your town.  Town.  Jordan's on the line.  Jordan.  Oh, Jordan.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:44:30]  Am I on the air finally?  Yes.  Yeah, sorry to make you wait for two days.  You know, we've been busy.  I know, I've been busy, too, trying to get over my fucking ordeal on Thanksgiving morning.  Thanks for nothing, guys.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Walk everyone through it, because maybe a lot of people are hearing this for the first time  and don't know what's going on.  What happened?  Okay, well, what happened was I go in, as you told me, to go into New York City and meet 
[02:45:00]  you at 178th and Amsterdam at 5.30 a.m.  Well, my train didn't get to 5.29, so obviously I'm going to be a little bit late, so I'm  running.  What do you mean?  You were going to come to the radio station?  Yeah, I was going to come to the radio station to sing for you guys on Thanksgiving for such  a treat.  But, unfortunately, I didn't make it past Penn Station, because when I got off the train,  some guy approached me out of nowhere, and I don't know who this guy was. 
[02:45:30]  I thought he was with open-air, because he knew my name.  I thought maybe you guys sent him down to spot me in the crowd, because he probably figured  I might be on the train right around 5.30.  So this guy, freaking out of nowhere, just says, hey, follow me, and all right, so I  follow him, and then he takes me in a cab ride, and then he takes me to the place, and  I'm like, is this really the studio?  And I'm like, and then he says, yeah, come in, and then he takes me in there and fucking  mugs me in the fucking lobby.  Took my money, took everything for me. 
[02:46:00]  It took me four hours to get home, because I had to bribe somebody on the street for change.  Through your tears.  What are you talking about?  How would anyone recognize you?  Yeah, first of all, how does anyone recognize you?  Well, he told me that he knew you guys, and that he had my picture.  Where did he get your picture? 
[02:46:30]  I don't know.  He didn't tell me where he got it.  How did he know where you were coming in from?  To be by the train, by the door, by, like, how did he...  No, he approached me in the station up when I went up, when I got off, when I got from  underneath, when you normally go up into the freaking terminal, and the guy just...  You're just lying.  You're just lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  And people saying this is a different story from what you told Sam yesterday. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, where did you...  He mugged you in the lobby of our studio?  I haven't sucked in...  I haven't sucked in freaking three and a half...  I've only slept two hours in the past couple days, man.  What do you...  Voices.  Where did you get mugged?  I'm trying to do a bid.  I don't even want to...  Yeah, what are you doing?  A bid?  I got mugged at 178th in Amsterdam, and I was in the lobby of your studio, supposedly.  Okay, yesterday you got mugged...  You would know it was a studio...  In Penn Station, which is where you got mugged yesterday.  Yeah.  You got to talk to me.  You got mugged in Penn Station? 
[02:47:30]  I got mugged in Penn Station.  The guy approached me, and he just took me to some...  You got mugged in the lobby of our studio?  Yeah, in the lobby just...  You get mugged in Penn Station?  I got approached by the guy in Penn Station.  Describe the gentleman.  The gentleman was a black guy.  In person.  Wearing a hoodie.  Of course.  Yeah.  Because those people do that, right?  A hoodie black guy.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Jordan.  What's wrong with you?  Poor guy.  You okay?  What's your malfunction? 
[02:48:00]  I'm okay now.  Let's cut to the chase.  What fucking drug are you on?  I'm not on any drugs.  To fucking...  Why are you yelling at the victim, though?  If the guy got victimized, why yell at him, though?  That's true.  Jesus Christ, because I'm done with kooks associated with this show.  Yeah, what was this where we cut him off at the path?  What was the conversation in the cab ride?  Yeah, yeah.  Or pass.  What was he saying?  Pass or pass.  It was just very...  The guy was very quiet, man.  He was just talking about life in general, but unfortunately... 
[02:48:30]  What was the conversation?  You can't just say life in general.  Yeah.  Don't yada, yada, yada us.  That's not a...  Yeah.  He just asked me, like, oh, what was my name, where I'm from, and everything, and the guy  was just being friendly to me, and he was just answering me friendly questions.  And I just answered everything, and I thought I was going to the studio to sing, and I got  mugged, and it took me nearly four hours.  How much was the cab?  How much was the cab?  The cab probably, like...  I didn't even pay for the cab. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, the mugger paid for the cab.  Yeah.  Before he mugged you.  Oh, that's a nice mugger.  Let's be honest with each other.  That's a nice mugger.  He is gambling, though, that you're going to have more money than he paid for the cab.  Because otherwise, he just gave you a ride for free and didn't mug you.  That's pretty cool.  But even though you didn't pay for the cab, you knew how much it was, because we all look.  How much was it?  How much was the cab ride to 178th and Broadway, was it?  No, Amsterdam.  Amsterdam, from Penn.  How much?  How much? 
[02:49:30]  Probably like 20 bucks.  Come on.  I don't remember the exact number.  At that hour of the morning?  At that hour?  Probably.  Yeah.  So he paid for a $20.  The mugger paid for a $20.  The mugger paid 20 bucks, not even knowing if you had five bucks.  He could have lost $15 mugging you.  And how did he know to take you all the way up to our studio at 178th and Amsterdam?  Yeah.  How did he know that? 
[02:50:00]  Because he was obviously one of your listeners, and one of the guys that, uh, and he disguised  himself as one of your, one of the people that worked for you.  Disguised himself in a hoodie?  Why wouldn't he even...  Yeah, he was that early.  He wouldn't be anybody that works for this show.  Yeah, exactly.  So if he walks in at 6.05, he might be me or E-Rock.  Why wouldn't he have just mugged you in the train station?  Yeah.  Instead of spending the $20 on a cab ride.  Right.  Exactly.  Especially 5.30 in the morning when no one's around.  Yeah.  What did he take from you, Jordan?  What did he take from me?  He took my wallet.  I had everything in there. 
[02:50:30]  I can't even drive around in my car because I don't have a license on me.  Oh, really?  And what building did he take you in?  Took me into the 178th and Amsterdam, the one on the corner.  What building is that?  Did you...  What's in that building?  What?  It was like a white...  It was like a white brick building.  I don't...  What is it?  Describe the building.  And it was opened at 5.30 in the morning with nobody in the lobby?  I guess so.  I don't...  How do you not know?  You were in it.  You were getting mugged. 
[02:51:00]  You didn't look around and see if anybody was in there?  Did he touch your hiney?  Nobody was in there.  No one was in a building.  The door was opened.  No one was there at 5.30 in the morning.  At 178th and Amsterdam.  And let me get this clear.  He asked for your name, obviously, in the cab?  No, he knew my name already because he spotted me in the crowd because he remembered what I  looked like from your show on two days ago.  How does he know how you look?  Oh, he's got pictures from the appearance.  Of course.  From the big appearance. 
[02:51:30]  Are you trying to take us to small claims court?  Let's cut to the chase.  No, he's not doing it.  At least show up.  The last one decided not to show up.  So what did the...  Dude, what did the police say when you reported it?  Well, the guy threatened to kill me and I figured I wasn't going to be able to identify  the guy because he looked like every fucking black guy in New York.  In person.  So you didn't report the mugging but decided I'll report it on a show that reaches, some 
[02:52:00]  say, a million people a week.  Well, it's okay because, as a big part, I forgive people.  Oh, you forgive people.  Come on.  Just fess up.  Please.  Stop with the wackiness.  Yeah, what's going on?  Just fess up.  What's going on?  You thought this was going to be an interesting kind of wacky radio story.  You're excited to be part of the show.  Yeah.  And you realize now, like, we don't believe you.  The audience doesn't believe you.  I believe you, brother. 
[02:52:30]  Right?  Jimmy believes you.  For the record, Jimmy believes you.  He's an asshole.  Why would he lie?  The guy came in.  Jimmy has love in his heart.  The guy recognized him from the live event and said, hey, you're going here.  Remember the address?  And paid for a cab ride and then mugged him in the bill.  Yes.  This is on television, Jimmy.  You don't have to put the serious face on.  But I do.  Like, you really mean what you're saying.  I do.  I do.  Why would I lie?  I'm a fucking loser, man.  I have no job.  Yep.  You are a loser.  So what?  You're not a loser.  You're a victim. 
[02:53:00]  Those are delicious.  Oh, gosh.  Where did he pick you up?  He picked me up in the lobby of Grand Central.  When you go up.  In the lobby of where?  In the lobby of Penn Station.  Yeah, you did say Grand Central Station.  Oh, Grand Central Station.  Those two stations are nowhere near each other, sir.  And by the way, Grand Central isn't opened until 6. 
[02:53:30]  I didn't say Grand Central, you moron.  You said Grand Central Station yesterday, you moron.  Right?  You didn't say that yesterday, right, Jordan?  You four-eyed freak.  Why don't you play the audio that says I said Grand Central, okay?  Did he say Grand Central yesterday, Sam?  Yeah, and then he corrected himself after I questioned.  Oh, oh.  Oh, see.  Where's the audio?  You can't back up your claim.  See.  You didn't discuss the show with this perpetrator on your way in the cab? 
[02:54:00]  We're asking why the studio is located in a grocery store.  We got Jaboney on the line.  He was the mugger.  Jaboney.  Jaboney.  I want to corroborate this guy's story.  I paid for the cab.  See, it's a write-off.  You got to spend money to make money.  That's the worst fucking black dialect I've ever heard.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  Blind Dave, everyone.  No, really?  Mm-hmm.  Blind Dave?  That was Blind Dave, I would have.  That sounded like him. 
[02:54:30]  What else, Jordan?  Jordan.  This is an unbelievable story.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  I might have to call up Tucker Max.  Were there any grocery stores near the studio?  I don't remember, man.  It's been a long fucking weekend.  Yep.  No, it hasn't.  It's the same length.  Every weekend is only two days long.  Well, Jordan, I got an NYPD cop on the line, because you're really supposed to report crimes. 
[02:55:00]  That's a crime in itself, not reporting it.  And Brian wants to talk to you.  Brian?  Yo.  Hey, you're on with Jordan, who got mugged, unfortunately, the other day.  Jordan, I'm sorry to hear about what happened.  You okay?  Oh.  Yeah, I'm fine, man.  It's not a big deal.  You know, I think I'll just let him, because the guy is obviously never going to be caught.  All right.  I have a couple questions for you.  Answered immediately.  You said that when you got on the train, he identified you.  He said, Jordan, come with me. 
[02:55:30]  You then stated that when you were in the cab, he asked you what your name is.  So, were you lying to you or why now?  First 48.  I didn't say that he asked my name in the cab.  He already knew my name in the station, because he recognized me from...  Right, but then he stated that when you were in the cab, he was talking to you about the  fact of life, and then asked you what your name was and what you did for a living.  So, which one is it?  Okay, yeah, I did say that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just really...  I haven't slept in...  I only slept two hours and four days. 
[02:56:00]  I'm really...  I don't know how I'm still on the phone right now.  Okay, well, you've been on the phone for two days.  So, obviously, you have the Constitution to do that, but you can't answer any questions.  Cops rule.  Whenever they say Constitution, you're in deep shit.  This line of questioning is great.  Jordan, this is real shit, man.  I wouldn't fuck around.  He tied him up in one fucking...  Yeah.  Like, one volley.  You're in deep shit now, Jordan.  Brian, continue. 
[02:56:30]  All right, Jordan.  Now, after you got this building that was open, you said it was on the corner.  What was the address of the building?  One-seventy-eighth in Amsterdam.  That's not an address.  That's a corner.  What's the address?  I don't remember.  Let me put it this way.  That might be too complicated.  Was the door on Amsterdam or one-seventy-eight?  I know it was on Amsterdam.  It was on Amsterdam.  Okay.  Brian, why don't you explain to Jordan, you know, reporting a false crime? 
[02:57:00]  What kind of shit he could be in?  Yeah, it's a misdemeanor, so that's not good.  You know, $200 up to a year in jail.  But, you know, the guy did threaten to kill him, so reporting it to the cops and reporting  it to a million people, you know, nationwide plus those Canucks in Canada, you know, I'm  sure that's a lot less, you know, it's more low-key doing it on an XM Sirius LA radio  rather than reporting it to the NYPD.  Yeah.  So, I'm looking at... 
[02:57:30]  He's a fan of the show, and I'm sure he's listening because he knows everything about  you from possibly seeing you for a total of ten minutes singing Sweet Caroline.  Now, I'm there, and I have no idea what you even look like.  I can identify the guy who puked in his potatoes, but I can identify you.  Yeah.  Jordan?  Yeah, I'm here.  You want him?  I'm still here.  I'm listening.  I'm letting him...  You're sticking to your story? 
[02:58:00]  Are you sticking to your story?  I'm sticking to my story, man.  What was...  All right, well, gentlemen, I don't know if there's anything else I can do.  I'm going to stamp this Bravo Sierra.  Yes.  And I'm going to punch out before I fuck this up.  Thank you, sir.  And we certainly could check the tapes, because there's tapes all over Penn Station or Grand Central  Station.  Does this guy realize that 178th and Amsterdam is absolutely, positively nowhere near your  studio?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  That's obvious.  Or is he sticking to the fact that, you know, he's trying to fuck with you guys?  The building that I'm looking at on Google here that he supposedly went into, the front  has one, two, three, four, five, six, like six businesses in it that I could see right  there, probably more.  Sir?  Jordan?  Jordan?  What door did you go in?  I'm seeing six, at least six or seven businesses on the Amsterdam side of this building. 
[02:59:00]  There isn't just one door there.  It's a whole strip of stores in this building.  So that's easy.  That's an easy question.  Which door?  Which door did you go in?  I don't remember.  How do you not remember?  Which door?  Was it the one all the way to the right?  Was it in the middle?  Was it on the left?  Was it close to the right side?  You know, uh, yeah.  Come on.  About?  I know it was in the middle.  I know it was in the other corner.  All right.  That's fair enough.  All right.  The middle. 
[02:59:30]  We got businesses.  Did you go into the laundromat or the Chinese restaurant?  There's no lobby area.  There's no lobby in a fucking, yeah, Chinese restaurant and a laundry.  What the fuck, dude?  You went into a laundromat thinking it's Sirius XM?  And that's where he mugged you?  5.30 in the morning.  Right.  Holy fuck.  Like, enough of these crazy...  Your story fell apart, sir.  Jordan, why don't you just be a man and say you wanted to get some more airtime, become  famous, and leave these boys alone. 
[03:00:00]  And all you had to do was call and go, look, I want to sing another song for you guys.  And I would go, yeah, let's do it nice.  By the way, you're not qualified to be an intern.  Doing stupid stuff for airtime.  Every time I tried to sing for you guys, you cut me off, so you're very rude.  We weren't rude.  We had a problem with the phones that day.  Everyone knows it.  Even Ronnie had a problem after we left.  To you.  Yeah.  You're a liar!  Goddamn liar!  Why don't you sing a song for everyone and make it all nice? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  I ain't singing for you.  You don't deserve to hear my voice anymore.  You have golden pipes, man.  Okay.  All right.  Don't deserve to hear your voice.  I'm fucking not begging.  I know I'm going to get cut off after five minutes, so if I keep calling back...  Five minutes?  What are you singing?  Fucking Free Bird?  Yeah, really.  A little spark of high-heeled boys.  Live version?  Live.  How about those fucking Giants?  What a horrible game last night, Hunter.  Oh, finally.  Something we could talk about.  Yeah, keep trying.  The lie didn't work, so let's talk sports. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Been around too long for this shit.  Would you go to the game at 178th in Amsterdam, where the stadium is?  The old polo grounds.  What?  Fucking Eli Manning threw more lobs than Kim Kardashian at a fucking New Jersey Nuts gathering.  Goddamn, that's a good one.  That motherfucker just turned this whole thing around.  You just redeemed yourself.  You just turned this thing around. 
[03:01:30]  You just redeemed yourself with that one.  Fuck, you know how much I hate Kim Kardashian.  That was perfect.  Oh, that fucking, her whole family's always famous because she fucked a nobody.  Fucking Ray J.  That guy's career was shorter than fucking Chris Humphrey's dick.  See, this is the shit that'll get you on the air, dummy.  The funny.  Make it funny, yes.  You're bringing the funny now.  Wow.  Yes, I am a funny guy.  Have you read my tweets, Jim Norton? 
[03:02:00]  I don't know.  I don't always check the at mentions.  Yeah.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  It all depends.  Okay, I thought I was still talking to you.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to step on you.  I actually have no thought.  That's okay, Jim.  Actually, you know what's funny is yesterday during your show, Monster Rain was on HBO Comedy  in the morning.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  You got any more Kardashian stuff?  Any more Kardashian stuff?  Well, I don't really have that much because she's not in the news anymore. 
[03:02:30]  I guess she's just fucking fading out just like Lindsay Lohan.  Because Lohan is killing it at the morgue.  She's doing community service at the morgue.  Holy shit.  Why don't we save some of these gems for next time?  I don't know how much you're fucking up.  Yeah, Gary's coming.  I got to take a leak.  So bad.  We got to pee real quick.  Yeah.  These are very funny.  Let us don't take leaks and we got Gary Oldman and we'll talk tomorrow.  Yeah, save a few of these gems there, Jordan. 
[03:03:00]  And if you say you got mugged, then you know what?  We got to believe you because I don't want to lose you as a participant on this radio show.  Well, my name is Jordan Kaye and I stick to my story because I have Asperger's and I'm  a complete retard.  All right.  He sure can sell himself.  All right, retard.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you tomorrow morning.  Yeah.  Great.  Fuck yourself.  Gary Oldman next.  Yeah.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  He's so horny. 
[03:03:30]  Serious XM.  I hear the music.  It gets into you.  I hear the music.  Millions of watts.  All of this low-level sound.  Well, it gets into you.  And so I said, well, you know what?  I hear the music.  Bring back the music.  All of this music.  Well, you know what?  I hear the music.  And so I said to him, I said, bring back the music.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth. 
[03:04:00]  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  And so I said to him, I said, wait a minute.  I hear the music.  Wait a minute.  I hear millions of watts.  And so I said to him, I said, y'all talk a big thing.  You only talk it.  You don't walk it.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Billions of watts going up into the ionosphere. 
[03:04:30]  You hear it through the front of your skull.  I hear billions of watts.  You hear it through the front of your skull.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  One of these days, they're going to fix this goddamn headphone situation.  What's the matter?  The music and the spots and everything are so much louder than our voices. 
[03:05:00]  And they don't understand that we're talking about just our headphones and not what goes out over the air.  So you try to fucking, like, I have to rip the headphones off my head  before the commercials start  or I get fucking blasted.  Nothing should be louder than our voices on this entire platform.  Our voices should be...  On earth.  First and foremost.  I actually think that they should pipe us into the lobby.  They should.  As the welcome.  And in the elevators, too.  As the welcome to Sirius. 
[03:05:30]  Funny guys 12 floors up.  Yes.  I think that's how the entire elevator system should be.  When you hit, like, 35 to come up, it should say 13 floors to funny guys, 12 floors to funny guys.  And it should just be our voices going through the elevator.  Yes.  Oh, wait a minute.  Gary Oldman.  Gary Oldman has arrived.  Yes.  Wow.  He's got an entourage.  Yes, he does.  Ah, yes.  Come right in, Mr. Gary Oldman.  Hello. 
[03:06:00]  Hello, sir.  Good.  Good, good.  How are you?  All right.  You know Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  How do you know Jimmy?  How do you know Jimmy?  I've seen him on there.  Oh, you have?  We're on the air.  Yeah, yeah, we're always.  Yeah, yeah.  We like just carrying on conversations like that.  Oh, I see.  You just made Jimmy's day, Mr. Owen.  Oh, my God.  I am stunned.  Jimmy, obviously, is a stand-up comedian, but I guess you're familiar.  I've not seen you live.  Yes.  But I've seen you do your stand-up. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  I've seen you on one of those shows that you've been on.  You add a little.  I think you add a little spice.  It might be Chelsea Lately you've been on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there we are.  One of the.  Jimmy.  One of the greatest actors of all time.  Absolutely.  Really.  Huge fan, by the way.  We're huge fanboys.  You would have said that before Gary said what he said.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, I've been saying that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like you're different every movie.  Like every movie, someone has to say, that's Gary Oldman.  Really?  Well, that's the fun of it for me. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was looking through your whole resume of movies, and yeah, Jimmy's right.  You know, you have a great career going for yourself.  I believe I've, is it 60 I've done?  Yeah, 70.  Someone said I've done 60 movies.  I certainly haven't, I haven't seen them all.  No?  And a few of them in the old days.  Yeah.  You know, when it was in the darker days.  I don't even remember making a few of them.  Wow.  Really?  I think so.  Yeah.  Why were they darker days?  They were just, why, it's nearly, you know, nearly, nearly 20 years ago now. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  You know, a little bit too, too much of the.  Substances.  A bit too much party.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy understands that.  Oh, yeah.  He's been sober for how many years?  Almost 25.  25 years?  25.  Almost.  Yeah, but I've been.  What's strange?  15 years.  15.  Oh, wow, really?  It's nice, right?  Yeah.  To remember everything?  Yeah, it's nice to, yes, it's nice to remember stuff.  Yeah.  I guess.  And thank God for the internet, too, because now I can switch addictions to sex. 
[03:08:00]  It's so nice to not drink anymore.  I can just instant message.  Yeah, and you don't even have to leave your apartment.  You know.  Well, we always.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Sometimes you don't.  Well, we always find it strange about Jimmy.  He got sober at seven.  18.  18, sorry.  Yeah, 18 years old.  That's realizing you have a problem very early on.  Yeah.  You're lucky if.  I think you're lucky if you can do that.  But I always was under the impression that at that age, everyone has a problem because  you're just young doing drugs or alcohol or both.  Well, you know, I think it just depends. 
[03:08:30]  My son, Alfie, he's nearly 23, and he's just a great kid.  I think I've seen him have a beer.  Really?  You know, doesn't smoke, doesn't do any of that stuff.  So it's not just everybody.  Everybody growing up doesn't have to.  Yeah, he's just.  And then you see other people and they're tearing their hair out with their kid.  Yeah.  And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's hard. 
[03:09:00]  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, you know, now I can, now I can say you're rather them  than me.  Right.  You know.  Um, but it's a horrible thing.  Did you tell him your experiences?  Because my father is quit drinking when I was two.  So I kind of always aware that there was a life without drinking when you were finished.  And do you kind of share with him what you went through, which made it maybe kind of  deter him?  Or did he see some of it?  No, no, he's just, that's just, it's just, just who he is. 
[03:09:30]  And, um, and I've got, uh, I've got, uh, well, one of my boys, I've got three sons and one's  nearly 13, one's 14.  And of course they've, that's all, it's like another life, you know?  Yeah.  So they've never seen, they've never.  Oh, right.  They don't even know of, uh, you, uh, in those days, the dark days.  It's like, as I refer to them, and there were some good, some good times too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you, were you worried that, that it was going to affect your performances, um, being 
[03:10:00]  sober?  No.  Because some people do worry that they, no, no, that's, that's all, um, rubbish.  I think that's all just rubbish that people sort of say that, you know, you'll, what is  it?  You'll, you'll, you'll, you, you think you'll lose your edge.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You start to, I was, someone reminded me when I got sober, cause we used to take mescaline.  And laugh.  And I, I asked the guy who was helping me at the time, I'm like, will I be able to laugh  again?  Like, I didn't think I'd be able to laugh without, without tripping.  It's such an odd thing that these weird, irrational things you tell yourself when you 
[03:10:30]  quit.  Yeah.  To keep yourself going.  And of course you romanticize.  Yeah.  You do a great deal of that, you know?  So all the, all the people that I used to look up to when I was, you know, when I was  growing up and looking at other generations, you know, before me, I mean, Richard Burton  and, uh, Peter O'Toole and all that, all that, all that, you know, it was all very  much, it's, it's, it is very much that culture.  Yeah.  It was almost glamorous, uh, kind of a lifestyle to be like that. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were, yeah.  Last time I was here, I was here a couple of weeks ago and we were staying at the Waldorf  Towers and you know, it's the first time I'd ever been.  Nice digs.  Nice digs.  Nice digs.  Nice digs.  And the walls are just, and the walls are just covered in these fantastic photographs and  it's, and it's, and it's Frank Sinatra and it's, it's, it's presidents and it's Lucille  Ball and it's, and it's Kurt Douglas, you know, and they all look like they're having a really  good time, you know, oh, the old days. 
[03:11:30]  Hold the martini, right?  Everybody's got a cigarette and a martini.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't show you the other, they don't show you like the William Holden fucking bleeding  out in his hotel room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, cracking his head on.  Or the William Holden suite, which you, which the, the, and the, yeah, the bloodstains are  still there all the time.  Oh my God.  He knows.  He knows. 
[03:12:00]  You can't play roles like, like you've played without, without being able to tap into that  because you're too good at, at, I didn't know you were British.  Like literally I did not know.  I had no idea he was British until I heard you interviewed one time.  That's how good you are.  It does freak us Americans out when some actors who do a very well, a very good English,  American accent, uh, turn out to be British for like, I've lived here a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've lived, I've lived in, in, I was here for about seven years in New York. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, really?  I'm in California now.  So, uh, but you know, my two, my two boys are born here.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm around it all the time.  Yeah.  I'm around it a little more.  So it's easier to pick up when you're doing a role, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially when you're living here.  New York.  That, uh.  When you hear, you come back and you hear that, you hear that sound.  Yeah.  Oh, I love that sound.  Well, that was, uh, that was, uh, uh, the accent I remember from, uh, the professional. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, was that a good one?  That was a good one.  Yeah.  State of grace.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did a movie with Sean Penn.  Mm-hmm.  The West is, yeah.  But yeah.  Yeah.  The, the Irish guys.  Yep.  Goddamn.  I, it's, it, it is amazing.  It's great to, great to have you here.  And, and your romance, by the way, because true romance to play that, to play, I don't remember  the name of the, of the white pimp and the dread, like Drexel.  Drexel.  Drexel.  Drexel.  Fuck.  Fuck, was that good?  I was looking through, like I said, I was looking through IMDb and looking through your  movies and there's so many characters like, fuck right. 
[03:13:30]  He, he was that guy.  He was this guy.  And it, it goes to what Jimmy was saying.  You play a different guy every time.  It's not like, oh, here's, you know, a Gary Oldman part.  Yeah.  It's, uh, really fantastic.  Keeps you, you, you, you know, you gotta, well, you know, from comedy, especially, I mean,  my, I, I, I admire it so much.  Don't admire Jimmy.  Please stop it.  No, I love, no, I, it's killing me.  No, I think, I think it is, I think it's, I think it's, uh, admirable. 
[03:14:00]  I see you guys, you see, and you have to, you've got to take the whole, you know, the  temperature of the room.  And I know that in clubs, you've got people that on a tour or a club, you've got people  going on before you and they're getting a lot of laughs.  And then there's maybe two people, you know, and then you've got to think on your feet and  you've got to assess the room, take the temperature, you know, maybe do the same act, but you've  got to speed it up.  You've got to see, I mean, that, that to me, that, that to me is a, I, I, I watch it. 
[03:14:30]  I, I, I look in awe at that.  Jeez.  The beautiful part of it though, is that when it's, this is where acting is so hard  for me.  I mean, it's really, I, I admire actors because I can get out of it.  If I'm bombing and it does happen in a scene, I just stand there in shame.  My arms go out and I'm awful.  But if I'm on stage, I can embrace that and go, wow, this stinks and address it to the  audience.  But when you're trapped and you're acting, oh my, is that fucking terrifying when you, when  you're, when you know you're not doing a good job as an actor, it's horrifying.  So you feel like that all the time, Jimmy? 
[03:15:00]  Yes.  I'm always like that.  Stand up is free for me.  That acting is very, very scary.  Especially on stage.  Yeah.  In the theater.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If, if you, if, and I've been in a few, if you're not in a good production, yeah, you  know, with, at least with film, you can stink and walk away.  When, when, yeah, in a play, you know, you stink, you've got two and two and a half, three 
[03:15:30]  hours of it every night.  And that's gotta be long.  That's gotta feel like, uh, forever when you're just bombing like that.  Cause you have a, you have a distance from it.  You see, you can be, if they, if they don't like you in a film, you know, it's, it's seven  months a year and you, and you maybe read a review or see something and you, you know,  and it's, it's a, it's a, it's a thing, it's a distant thing.  You know what I mean?  Right.  But when you, when, if you, if you read a bad review and you know that you've got to  go to the play that night. 
[03:16:00]  And do it.  Yeah.  And now you've got to perform.  You're stuck.  Oh man.  Do you take a lot of reviews to heart?  Do you, does, does it affect you?  Well, I think it affects you, it affects you less the older you get because you don't  have, I mean, you have an ambition, but the ambit, that it's, it's a youthful ambition.  I mean, that thing and that competitiveness is, it, it, it, it, it, yeah, it diminishes. 
[03:16:30]  Subsides a bit.  Yeah.  So it used to eat at you a lot more when you were coming up.  Yeah.  You remember the, the thing you've got to do is you were just, just, it's the ones in  between, you know, don't believe the ones that are crazy about you.  Don't believe the really bad ones.  Just average it out.  Average it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This movie, I saw this yesterday.  Yeah.  Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy. 
[03:17:00]  Yes.  And, and you're amazing in this.  There's a real stillness to you in this.  And it's about, I guess, rooting out a Russian mole in British intelligence.  And it's where Colin Firth is in it.  And can I tell you the thing that struck me that.  Yeah.  No, I think we, I mean, yeah, the actors in it are, I mean, we emptied the national theater.  Yeah.  We just got, we just got everybody.  Those scenes, there's scenes, it's, it's, you know, in the British.  British intelligence, the higher office.  Yeah.  During the Cold War. 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  1973, I think it takes place.  And this, by the way, they should win an Oscar for, for the set and for the camera work.  I noticed the camera work.  And when you notice how brilliant the camera work is, it was like, it's one of the best  shot movies I've ever seen.  Wow.  Ever.  And I couldn't stop noticing that, no matter what was happening, if it was just walking.  And he doesn't do a great deal with it.  It's not, it's not camera work that is, you know, wazzle dazzle.  No, it's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That tracks along the floor and goes up the wire, you know, microphone. 
[03:18:00]  But it's beautifully, he tells, he can tell a story with a, you know, with four lines,  you know, a look and the composition.  Yeah.  And you get very carried into the, the time.  Yes.  Of, of, uh, you know, I've never had a movie actually put me, and it might be the lens  he used to, but I've never had a movie actually put me in an era like this.  Like it's, it's more, a boogie nights was great.  Seventies, early eight.  But this movie, you really feel like you're sitting in a theater in the mid 1970s. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  He used a lot of telephoto lenses.  He wanted to give you a feeling of, um, or almost like there was another sort of a spy  in the room, a sense of voyeurism.  And it's funny that, I mean, the look that he went for, Thomas Alfredson, we're talking  about, uh, he is very, he's unusual, very, he's a real, he's an original piece, Thomas.  And when they were looking for the, uh, when they were discussing the palette, the color  palette of the movie and looking for the, for, for that look, he did not reference other 
[03:19:00]  films, he, he, he, he and his DP, a guy called Hoyter Van Hoytema, who shot this beautifully.  Um, he, they discussed the, he wanted to capture the smell of damp tweed.  That, that was the color he was going for.  That's like, I mean, it's, it's, it's, that's interesting because it actually does conjure  up something when you say that.  It's nicotine.  It's that orange nicotine coat tea. 
[03:19:30]  I remember it well.  There's a scene too where they're smoking in the, uh, and this is how you know where you  are.  It's, it's in the sauna and they have just, you know, there's a discussion going on in  the sauna about something.  And the one guy's just sitting there and you see a guy in the back showering and he's just  smoking in the sauna.  You're like, that's such a great.  Yeah, they just played squash.  They're just, I think it's the minister and he's smoking a cigarette.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  That's fantastic.  Who was the guy?  What's his name too?  I keep forgetting his name.  He was tremendous.  He played, I think his name is Peter.  He was one of your partners, the younger guy with, he's got like a long head and blonde  hair.  He is, that's a character called Peter Gwilham and it is played by, uh, an actor called  Benedict Cumberbatch.  What is it?  Is he?  He's.  That sounds made up.  It's like, it's Dickensian.  Yeah.  He's a character, but Mr. Benedict Cumberbatch, um, he is, uh, he's a remarkable young actor,  isn't he?  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  It was tremendous.  And John Hertz in this movie too.  Love John.  John and my, that, that, that for me is a career ambition.  Yeah.  Fulfilled.  Really?  I have, I want, I've loved John long before I even got the idea of being an actor.  Yeah.  I used to watch him and when we got him and when he said he was in, you know, I was, I  was so excited.  And the first day on the set, I was just a bag of nerves.  That's amazing.  Did you hear that from Gary Oldman? 
[03:21:00]  I was fan boy.  I was like, I would clean his shoes.  Wow.  That's amazing.  I know.  Did you have a scene with him the first day?  It wasn't the first day, but the, but the, but it, it wasn't my first day, but, but I  remember pulling into that car park where the, uh, base camp and, uh, and, and there  he was standing in the car park, smoking a cigarette, talking to one of the drivers.  That's good.  That sounds like a, yeah, yeah, my dear boy. 
[03:21:30]  Um, and I was shaking.  It's nice, but it's, it's a nice feeling where you can still, where you can still, that you're  not, I'm not, thank God, you know, I'm not so jaded that I can't get excited about.  And you very well could be though.  You know, you've earned the right to be jaded.  Meeting another actor, you know.  Did you say hello to him immediately?  Yeah.  I just, you know, it was, it was love at first sight. 
[03:22:00]  And you know what?  The great thing is he is one of the most adorable human beings you could ever meet.  Yeah.  He's, he's, he's, he's a fantastic guy.  So he doesn't disappoint.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  That would be, that would have sucked.  Yeah.  You know, he's somebody comes up in there.  Wonderful actor, wonderful guy.  It's gotta be awful when somebody is just unpleasant, uh, to work with.  That you've, you know, especially somebody you've looked up to.  Yes.  I want to know more about this movie, Jimmy.  Um, again, it takes place in 73 and they, it's, it's hard to, I don't want to give anything 
[03:22:30]  away.  Um, it's a, it's a very classic spy, uh, thriller type of movie.  They don't, like you said, there's no wham, bam bullshit with the camera work and, uh, the  tension in it.  There's a few scenes of tension.  And it's as good as I've ever seen done in a film, uh, starting with, I guess in the  first few minutes, it had me from the very, very beginning of the film.  Uh, the tension building is amazing.  And it's like, what if, what a fucking great spy movie.  Yeah.  Like you're just, you're, this one's looking, the cameras on that one, you're like, what 
[03:23:00]  the fuck is going on?  It was really, really tense.  Yeah.  And they've avoided, I'm happy to say that they've, they avoided it as I've described  that the pace of it is a little, it's a bit like watching a lava lamp.  It's got a pace that's like, it's like snow falling and you hear things, you hear sounds  in the movie, but, but it's not that he's amped them up.  It's just that he surrounds them with silence. 
[03:23:30]  And so it, I mean, he gets a lot in and it's a big book.  We've had to really cut that, cut that book down, um, but he, but you never feel that  he's, he's, uh, there's a pace to it.  Yeah.  He's taking his time yet.  We have, uh, yet, yet we get all the information across and, um, he is, he's done a, he's, he's  not, they haven't pandered to that thing of, well, let's do, uh, but born bond. 
[03:24:00]  Right, right.  And, which I love.  And, and I think they, I think they're well done.  But, uh, but a great, a great spy story, especially set in the cold war, because there was no greater  time for espionage than during the cold war.  That, that makes it, uh, yeah, after, after that whole thing ended, uh, people just kind  of, I think technology as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were just on that.  It's just, you're on that cusp of, of this is still very much a sort of analog world.  You know, with people, you know, knocking on walls and, and, and, you know, and reel 
[03:24:30]  to reel tape recorders.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trying to hide them.  And those little MinX Spy cameras that they had.  And, and you're, you're, I mean, a few years, we're in 73.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, we had Steve Jobs.  When was that first?  The digital age started.  I mean, it all, it all, it, it all changed.  And I think.  Yeah, that, that, that old stuff had to be on tape and film and.  And files.  File, right, right.  In paper files.  You know, a piece of paper, you know, top secret. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Was then taken down to a, to a dungeon somewhere and, and filed away.  I mean, it was that very, a very different world.  And there weren't cameras every single two feet.  So you could kind of do a little bit.  It's like, there's a scene where the guy has to grab files out of an aisle that he's not  supposed to be grabbing.  And it's just, you're like, why were the cameras?  Oh, that's right.  It's 1973.  You could do certain things.  We actually had to shove something into your briefcase instead of just taking a quick  cell phone picture of it.  This is what I want to ask you too. 
[03:25:30]  In the, in the, they're all, all the offices are like these mini standing structures in this  giant warehouse.  Kind of like it.  Yes.  Is that so people couldn't listen in or put their ear right to it?  That was an invention of the director.  Yeah.  The, the, the sort of MI6, MI5, MI6, um, as you can imagine, they were in very, uh, they  were, they were in old Victorian buildings.  So, um, the halls of, of MI5 were, were very narrow and he felt that that cinematically 
[03:26:00]  would, would, would be a little dull to, and, and restricting and, and, and we've seen  it.  Wow.  So he had this idea to have a sort of the, it's like MI6 inside MI6.  Right.  So he has that building and he wanted to open the space up and he, and he and the, um, the  designer, um, Maria Jerkovic, who should get an Oscar. 
[03:26:30]  I'm telling you.  For the set design?  Yeah.  It was amazing.  She and Thomas came up with this idea of, uh, opening up the space, but putting people  in these sort of seventies.  Prefabs.  Almost.  Yeah.  Did you actually talk to people in the intelligence community or like when you prepare for something  like that?  Um, cause again, I was amazed at the stillness.  They told you so much about who you were and what your life is just by your showing your  daily routine of just this odd, lonely swimming and coming home to an empty house. 
[03:27:00]  It was a really amazing way to show that this guy is just lonely.  Um, did you actually talk to people in the intelligence community there?  No.  What I did was I, I mean, the, the, the source material, the book is, I mean, everything you  want to know about playing smiley is, is in that 500 and whatever pages.  Um, but we had access to John le CarrÃ© who wrote the book, who was MI5, MI6. 
[03:27:30]  Um, so that was one-stop shopping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I didn't have to, I didn't have to work really much outside of the, of the,  of the, of the book, the script and the man himself.  Mm.  And, uh, so it was, it, it was, you, you know, you just had access right to the, right  to the man.  Do you, do you need, uh, some kind of like access like that or, or many times can you  just read a script and not really have to delve too deeply into what you're playing? 
[03:28:00]  Are you asking me or Gary?  No.  Oh, show up, Jimmy.  No, you know what?  There's a, um, uh, there's a, a, a quote by the acting guru, um, Meisner, Stanley Meisner.  Stanford.  Stanford Meisner.  Thank you for correcting me.  Yes.  Um, who said that acting was, uh, he said, living truthfully under imaginary circumstances.  Mm.  Yeah.  I mean, that's, that puts it, uh, you know.  But some people are much better doing it than others. 
[03:28:30]  But you need, but you do, you know.  But you have to have a certain.  There's downplay it a little bit, isn't there?  You know, you've got to have intuition.  That, that is a big part of it.  You know what the hardest part is for me?  Like besides memorizing the dialogue, um, which is critical, is the listening.  When you, when you watch somebody listening in a scene, it's like, it's so hard to look  like you're taking information for the first time.  But listening is active.  That's, it's not.  You're not just standing there.  It's not just hearing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's, it's, it's action. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  You know?  And, um, uh, not actually another quote by the, by the same, by the same man.  It was, uh, an ounce of behavior is worth a pound of words.  Wow.  Yeah.  And you sure get that with, you get that with Smiley.  I've used just the opposite.  A pound of action and forget the words.  I love his laugh.  It's, uh, it is odd that sometimes you, watching a movie and watching a well-acted, uh, movie, 
[03:29:30]  you see people after delivering a line, do a little face twitch or, or just a, a, a snicker  or something that really makes it.  Something very subtle.  And that's not in the, that's not in the script.  Right.  That's what makes, uh, an actor great.  It makes the performance.  I'm telling you what makes an actor great.  What was your favorite, what was your favorite role?  I'm an ass.  Because there's so many movies that we all want to talk about.  But what was, what was your favorite role to play?  Well, I've enjoyed this.  I've enjoyed this a lot.  You've enjoyed this a lot?  Yeah.  It writes as one of the best experiences. 
[03:30:00]  Uh, I mean, I, I, I, I say, I think it's, it is arguably, I think one of the, the greatest  role.  Yeah.  Really.  That I've had.  I think it's a fun, it's a gift.  You have an amazing monologue in it, by the way.  Where you're describing a, a, a, just an interrogation.  Yeah.  Amazing.  You should get money.  You sold this movie.  I'm telling you.  But I really, I can't wait to see it now.  But he got, but you, you got the movie.  Yeah, I loved it.  Yeah.  And I was watching it.  I'm like, what a fucking monologue.  Like when you read a script and you see like you have that monologue, that's got 
[03:30:30]  to make you feel good.  Like, you know, what you can do with that moment.  You know, oddly, funny enough, you want to, the more we, the more you take out, it is  that old, like I said, you know, you could, you, you see a page of dialogue and you say,  listen, you know, maybe I could do this with two lines and a look.  Okay.  And that is a very, that, but that's a set piece.  And I think the, I think the, Tomas's idea was that he didn't want to go back to another 
[03:31:00]  flashback and we didn't want to see Carla because the two people that are ghosts in  his life are the wife, Anne, who you never see.  Right, right.  And, and the face of Carla.  Um, you see his wife briefly through the window at the party.  Yeah, you always, but you see her in the back of her head, you see her in soft focus.  Um, and they other, and they, the, really the, the two characters that, that, that haunt 
[03:31:30]  him.  Right.  Um, so I thought it was a great, a great idea not to, not, not to put a face to them.  We may do a, we, there's whispers that we may do the third book, Smiley's People.  Oh, okay.  I did, I was not familiar with the book.  There's a, there's a trilogy.  It's a Tinker Taylor, the honorable school boy, Smiley's People, where he, uh, he gets  Carla.  Oh, okay.  Uh, finally, finally. 
[03:32:00]  But, um, so, you know, it would be great to.  But your question about, um, cause I mean, he was serious black and, and Harry Potter, man.  Well, I liked Oswald.  Well, true romance, true romance, true romance, but you get, you get, you know, you don't  often, it was two days at work and you don't often get a chance to come in and play a character.  A character like that, that really stands out in two days work is amazing.  Absolutely.  Well, I think, well, with the, with the eye and the scar and the wig and the thing, I 
[03:32:30]  thought, well, I'm only, I've only, I'm only in it for three minutes.  I might as well.  Make a splash.  Make a splash.  Yeah.  But it was the, the finger sucking too.  A splish.  I want to make a splish.  A splish.  Come on.  Oh, God damn, Roland.  I know, they're saying Gary has other, they're saying you got to wrap up.  He's a busy guy.  Someone's wife.  We got to respect your time.  I know.  Yes.  Mr. Oldman.  Um, one, one, honestly, one of the greatest actors of all time.  And I'm not just saying that cause you're here.  Um, I put you in the same category as Brando or any of those other guys that did roles like 
[03:33:00]  the young lions or all these different accents or all of these different, you never knew  who Brando was.  It looks different in every movie too.  Every time.  Especially when you see his old stuff.  Right.  And you do the same thing.  Uh, Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy.  I loved it.  Uh, when is it out?  It is out, um, six nights of December.  Ninth of December.  Okay.  So probably a week from the second.  In theaters next Friday.  I should probably know that.  I just did nine minus seven is two.  Like an asshole.  Next Friday, Jimmy.  Okay.  Next Friday.  Oh, God. 
[03:33:30]  And I guess, I guess that's it for today for us.  Cause I'm going to try to bother Gary for a photo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all lie.  Can we get photos?  Yes, of course.  Photos would be great.  And thank you.  Thank you, Gary.  Thank you so much.  Please come back and see us.  Yeah, I will.  See you guys tomorrow.  See you next tomorrow.  Thank you.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes. 
[03:34:00]  What's Roland doing out there?  Roland.  He can't hear me.  It's soundproof.  Roland.  Roland.  Somebody tell Roland to come in here.  I'm waving my arms like a maniac.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan.  America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Oh, you got to do.  I was just going to say, you got to be feeling good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's.  Oh.  You're there.  Boost your mic for Gary Oldman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was awesome.  I didn't hear the interview for the other people. 
[03:34:30]  It was great.  You should have seen Jim's face.  When he found out that not only Gary Oldman knew who he was, but had admiration for him.  Really?  He said, I've got great admiration for what you do.  And Opie and Anthony were like, no, no, don't say that.  Well, in English terms, I mean, hey, that's pretty cool what you do.  I understand now.  I was wondering.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But his movie was awesome, though.  Howard, it's very, and it kind of shows what you do for the show when, generally speaking, 
[03:35:00]  somebody like Gary Oldman probably would not do this show.  No.  Was it tough?  Yeah.  It was.  Yeah.  You had to pull, like, strings and convince some people.  Yeah, because he's an Oscar.  He's an Oscar.  He's an actor.  He's a guy.  I mean, he's, I was going through his stuff for his bio last night, and he's the guy,  like, the list of actors that credit him as their influence.  It's like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt.  And then Harrison Ford said he was nervous working with Gary Oldman.  Harrison Ford was.  Yeah, because he said Gary Oldman was a powerful actor, so it's like. 
[03:35:30]  It's amazing.  I mean, and he really is.  But I would hope, though, that interviews like this remind other actors that this is a safe place.  Like, Gary Oldman has a great time on here.  The other one is coming, too.  Gary Oldman's friend's coming in next, on January.  Are you allowed to say?  I don't know.  He's a big one, too.  He's, he's, he, also, he's an actor's actor, too.  Is he, is he big commercially?  Because Gary Oldman.  Well, yeah, well, he won two Oscars.  He has, he's a.  His friend. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  His friend won one Oscar and, like, three Golden Globes.  So we're talking about an Academy Award winner.  Yeah, another one, yeah.  It's Jack Nicholson, isn't it?  I can't say.  I can't confirm.  It's Jack.  I love it.  He was great in Cuckoo's Nest, and I just watched About Schmidt for the hundredth time  over the weekend.  What a movie.  The juxtaposition between his character in Cuckoo's Nest versus him getting old and being  in About Schmidt is really something to behold.  I mean, I don't know if you, those were the two, because I watched Cuckoo's Nest like two 
[03:36:30]  weeks ago.  Yeah.  And then the next Nicholson movie I watched after that was about Schmidt.  Yeah.  I think the last thing he actually did was, like, Johnny Carson, Jack Nicholson.  You think that was the last, that was the last press?  Well, the camera's, like, extra in that.  We'll catch him for, like, a two-second clip.  Mm-hmm.  Like, how are you?  He goes, yes.  And then we'll keep him walking, and then he won't stop.  Well, I feel like, you know, now that we've done Gary Oldman, who else did we just have  in here not too long ago?  I mean, we've had What's-Her-Face.  What's the woman who you cried about because they almost canceled?  Oh, Glenn Close. 
[03:37:00]  Glenn Close, when you had your breakdown, but we had...  And she's going to be nominated for an Oscar this year and win, and then I'm going to say  shit on all your faces.  Exactly.  You made me have an emotional breakdown to accept Glenn Close.  I think it's called Mr. Knob, and everybody said, this is her year, she'll win the Oscar.  That's amazing.  And once she wins the Oscar, I'm going to go, see, idiot, this is what...  But you'd think people like that would alert the Hollywood community to let them know,  look, why don't you cut Mark Wahlberg.  That's who I was thinking of who was just in here.  I mean, he's not the actor's actor that, you know, somebody like who he had in Today 
[03:37:30]  was, but he's an A-lister for sure.  Yeah.  And I mean, he's not an Academy Award winner, but who's to say?  Yeah, but Gary Roman's friend who will come in...  I've got to know who this friend is.  Is it male or female?  Male.  It's a male.  Or as well, it says male.  Well, they've both been in movies together, too, so...  They've been in movies together.  But Gary Oldman's done, like, 70 movies.  I know, that's why I gave you that clue.  It could be Heath Ledger with the clues you gave me.  I know, that's why I gave you that clue, so you won't know who it is. 
[03:38:00]  And it's Academy Award winner, though.  Yep.  Heath Ledger didn't win that award, or did he?  No, and then he won a few Golden Globes, this guy, too.  Did Heath Ledger win the award for Batman?  No.  Uh-huh.  Who could it be, then?  I don't have any clue.  Give me another hint.  One more hint.  Oh, you'll find out once the mics are off.  Oh, well, I want to know now.  I want to tell the people.  Thank you.  Well, I want to tell...  Well, if I tell the people now, they're like, Twitter...  I don't want nobody Twittering this guy.  And then they end up canceling.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  They'll find out in the new year. 
[03:38:30]  It's tough to be you, Roland.  But you'll tell me once the mics are off?  Oh, yeah.  You'll know in the email, yeah.  It was amazing seeing Gary Oldman in here, because it's like, it's not one of the...  Because he's not like a big, famous, you know, TMZ guy.  He's not like Mr. Blockbuster.  He's a consummate actor.  He's like an amazing actor.  Yeah, and the movie is freaking phenomenal.  And, I mean, part of that is the reason he's not so well-known, because people know him 
[03:39:00]  by his characters, less than they know him by who he is off-screen.  You know what I mean?  It's like when...  When you're in Hannibal, like he's that creature thing.  You forget all these movies.  Like, I'm going through all these movies that he's in, like...  And he doesn't steal the scene.  He just goes in, he plays the part as it should be played.  And you completely get lost in the character.  He's Commissioner Gordon.  I mean, for those of you who are very historically illiterate, you could see him in the Batman movies.  He's Commissioner Gordon.  And that's why he has a mustache now, because he just wrapped. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, doing the third one.  Yeah.  But he is...  He's not Gary Oldman when he's in those movies.  He's Commissioner Gordon one minute, and he's a cop with glasses and a mustache.  And then you turn on Sid and Nancy, and he's Sid Vicious.  Yeah.  It's incredible what this guy can do.  It boggles my mind, because, for instance, Ben Affleck.  That's a bad actor.  Like, I don't know if I'm trampling on your bookings or if I'm upsetting publicists, but  he's not going to come in here anyway.  He's very bad at acting.  I think he approaches it differently than others. 
[03:40:00]  Yes, yes.  He approaches it very differently in the sense of, how much do I get paid for this?  I'll read the lines as they're written.  He's not good at acting.  The movies he's directed that I remember haven't been bad.  Also, the guest coming in is Gerard Butler's friend, too.  Oh, Gerard Butler's another big guest that we had.  But Gerard Butler is a better actor than Ben Affleck, because Ben Affleck, you watch him  in movies, and I've never, ever...  I love some of his...  Like, I love Boiler Room, for instance. 
[03:40:30]  That's my favorite movie that Ben Affleck is in, mainly because he plays himself in  that movie.  He's just a douchebag.  I mean, and he strikes me, I don't know the man personally, but I'm assuming he's somewhat  of a douchebag, because...  Do you know him?  I met him a few times.  He's not a douchebag.  He wasn't a douchebag to you.  Super nice.  This is all assumption on the part of me, just based on what I see, because...  You're talking crazy talk now.  You think it's insane?  It's all crazy talk.  It's insane.  Do you know what it is?  What?  You're just pissed off that Matt brought shitty cookies...  I'm still...  ...and claiming that your mom is a bad baker, but in reality, Matt's mom's all over the 
[03:41:00]  map of baking.  It's just horrible.  It's just like the Jackson Pollock of baking.  And Jackson Pollock was very overrated.  Yeah, like...  I mean, sure, some people said he was a genius.  Five, six chips here in this cookie, and then 20 chips in the other cookie.  Yeah.  It's like De Niro and Casino.  An equal number of blueberries in every muffin.  Yes.  You know?  And that's a philosophy that one should live life by.  It's like being your mom's delicious heavenly carrot cake cupcake.  Three icing carrots on every cupcake. 
[03:41:30]  And it tastes delicious constantly.  Exactly.  It's like my mom's cupcakes are the Gary Oldman of baked goods.  They're dependable, they're excellent, and they're the consummate professional.  Matt's mom is like the sloth from Goonies.  Yeah.  Kind of.  A lot of CGI and makeup thrown on a shitty performer.  A lot of mumbling on...  Like, all right, yeah, we'll have one.  But what I was saying, Roland, I understand you're trying to get me off course.  Yes, I did.  What I was saying about Ben Affleck, what? 
[03:42:00]  That's why the entire company enjoyed my mom's cookies yesterday.  Except for...  It's Diary of a Wimpy Kid.  Except for Diary of a Wimpy Kid.  That's what it looks like.  It's the worst haircut I've ever seen.  So far I've heard...  It's a great haircut.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ed Grimley, and Alfred E. Newman.  Rana Fez, intern, yes.  Hi, this is UCB Fred.  I just want to say, when I first met Matt, he kind of reminded me, he kind of had this  kind of caveman look.  Like, imagine you were climbing the Alps and you stumbled upon a cave and you brushed 
[03:42:30]  off some snow and you saw this face looking at you.  But not like a good-looking caveman like Brendan Fraser.  No, a very good-looking caveman.  No, wait, wait.  Like Brendan Fraser in Encino Man.  Like, that was a very good-looking caveman.  A hot caveman.  But that's not you.  And now the caveman is just, you know, it's the part of the movie where they make him  over and he still has those caveman features, but he just looks, you know, he's got like  gel hair.  Like a caveman.  I have evolved.  Like a caveman trying to fit into modern society.  Ooh, Salvador is here. 
[03:43:00]  Sal, I mean...  Are you talking about the haircut?  Yeah, yeah.  Pee-wee Herman.  You think Pee-wee Herman?  See, all...  I see no resemblance.  And he's not talking about Paul Rubin.  He's talking about the character.  It literally goes up.  With the cowlick and everything.  So, so far...  I've gotten nothing but compliments on my haircut.  No, that's not true.  Look at all the people who just said negative things.  Yeah, from you people, but from people who actually know fashion and good looks, I've  gotten nothing but compliments.  Wow.  You see me, Fred comes in here dressed like a million bucks.  At least...  His shirt's not even ironed.  It's all wrinkled. 
[03:43:30]  Let me finish.  At least 60% of the time.  You don't shower for six days.  By the way, wait, wait, wait.  Matt, your shirt still has the creases in it from where it was folded.  Who are you talking to about shirts?  Did you just buy that?  No.  Those are glass houses, Matt.  Exactly, Matt.  This is one of the perma-iron shirt.  No, it's not.  It's got fold marks in it.  You can barely...  It was folded, but you can barely see that it was folded, and that's the point of the  shirt.  How did I see it?  Well, I don't know.  It's right there.  There's fold marks across...  You're not two feet away from me.  You're eight feet away from me.  And there's fold marks running down your entire shirt. 
[03:44:00]  Sam, anyways, I got nothing but compliments on my mom's cookies yesterday.  Is that like nothing but compliments on your haircut?  Yes, I've got...  Because it's lies.  It's not.  It's just lies.  I've got every person, men and...  What do I do with them?  Men and women in this company who have seen me have been like, wow, you got a haircut.  You look amazing.  You look so great.  Amazing.  Who said you look amazing?  Several people.  You have a guest coming.  Oh, I do.  Matt, hit the bricks.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to come to interview the guest.  Jimmy's coming?  Yeah.  Great.  Who's the guest?  You want to say it off the air? 
[03:44:30]  I don't...  John Walsh.  Can I say that?  Yeah.  Okay.  John Walsh is coming in?  Are you sticking around?  You might as well.  I was going to leave, but I'm like, I might as well stay for a few minutes.  I was going to ask him for a picture.  I'm like, let's help him push the show because it's coming back on.  What's the...  America's Most Wanted?  I think it's going on Lifetime.  Again, it's coming back?  Yeah.  It's coming back to Lifetime Television starting this Friday night.  Okay, Friday night, Lifetime Television.  You see what we do here?  Friday night, Lifetime.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  This show cannot be kept off the air. 
[03:45:00]  This show shouldn't be kept off the air.  Yeah.  And it won't be.  It refuses to submit.  I'm going to get it.  All right.  Thank you, Spencer.  It's a really weird public service, the show.  And when they yank it because of...  I mean, I don't want to repeat what I'm going to say when John's here anyway.  Yeah.  But he's written a couple of books, both of which were very, very good.  Tears of Rage.  And I forget the...  I forget what the follow-up was.  Listen, you talk about turning lemons into lemonade.  This is the guy.  Yeah.  Unless it's probably not the right term to use, but yeah.  I mean, he took a horrible situation and turned it into this giant franchise of a show that's helped thousands. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, and he's had a lot of terrible people got put in jail.  Yeah.  Because of him.  Thank God.  You know, I've read the story of what happened to his son.  It's horrible.  It's a horrible fucking story.  Like, most people don't even...  They don't function after that.  You know what I mean?  Like, they're just done.  But he...  I mean, he did an amazing job.  Is he coming in now, or...  What are we looking at time-wise? 
[03:46:00]  What time-wise?  How about time-wise?  Should I do this now?  You do, read it.  Okay, all right, all right.  Before John Walsh gets in here, John Walsh, the only thing he loves more than putting bad guys in jail...  I'll move one thing.  Yeah.  Good one, Roland.  The only thing John Walsh loves more than putting bad guys in jail is Argentium.  Of course.  Yes, what is Argentium?  Everybody knows at this point.  It's Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's right.  Steven Singer's brand new collection of silver is made from Argentium. 
[03:46:30]  The king!  Of course, that was going to cue when I said king.  Steven Singer, this bed doesn't make any sense.  What makes sense is Argentium.  You can go to Steven Singer and get it.  See it for yourself.  The collection starts at only $149.  It's more pure than sterling.  It's brighter than platinum.  It's the greatest thing you could ever get.  And with the holidays coming up, what could possibly be a better gift?  Go online to IHateStevenSinger.com.  View the collection for yourself, and you can have it shipped directly to your door for free with Steven Singer's free shipping, 365 days a year. 
[03:47:00]  And he gives you a 90-day full money-back guarantee, but you'll never use it.  I never have, and I've done business with him so many times.  Call him up, 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER, or visit him online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  You can even see the man himself.  See him in person.  It's like meeting a celebrity and getting a great deal on jewelry.  He's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
[03:47:30]  And when you see him, tell him Sam Roberts said hi.  And then question his choice for the Superman bed for his live reads on After Open Anthony Live.  I just don't understand them.  I thought you were going to say it's like being a celebrity and an ass.  Yeah, both those things.  Steven Singer has the rare combination of being a celebrity and an absolute ass.  He'll give you a fantastic deal on whatever jewelry you need, but he's a horse's batoot.  Yeah, he really is.  And he knows it.  As a person, he's garbage. 
[03:48:00]  He just happens to have a good store with very good products.  Yeah, and he hires the right people.  That's what Steven Singer does.  I mean, he's an ass, but he hires the right people to keep around him.  And make him look good.  I understand he just got busted watching porn on a plane on a Delta flight.  Is that what he does?  First class, yeah.  Is that him?  Yeah, I think it was him.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  He's not doing very well as the coach up at Syracuse.  I had no idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's been doing that for a while.  Wrong guy to hire, I guess.  Wrong guy to hire.  But 35 seasons strong for Steven Singer. 
[03:48:30]  Absolutely.  And between that and his Penn State duties.  It's the same joke three times.  Look, he's a child molester.  Do you understand?  Yes.  You get what we're saying here?  All right.  Are we ready for John Walsh?  I'm ready for him, but he might be in another interview.  But I've been a fan of his for many, many years.  Yeah.  I mean, I used to watch America's Most Wanted all the time.  And it went off.  It was canceled before on Fox.  Yes.  And the people brought it back.  It's been off the air for a long time, though. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know how long.  Can I have the video for Gary Oldman?  Of course you can.  And as a matter of fact, as soon as Gary Oldman came in here and started complimenting you,  I just left the camera on a shot of you two together.  Oh, that's perfect.  So you could see the interactions going on.  There he is.  How did you feel when he said, I have great admiration for what you do?  Oh, it was great.  I mean, I gave him my number.  I'm like, if you want to come to the comedy cellar one night, let me know.  You think it's sad that I was more excited for CM Punk?  No.  I understand.  You're a fool. 
[03:49:30]  I thought you were going to say fan.  No, you're a fool.  But he really is one of the greatest actors in the world.  Yeah, I mean, we were talking about it before.  It's amazing.  Like, he just transforms characters.  Like, he completely transforms himself.  Like, you forget half the movies he's been in because it's not him.  It's whatever he's playing.  And that doesn't happen with everybody in Hollywood.  We were just talking about how horrible Ben Affleck is in movies.  I've never watched a movie that Ben Affleck is in and said to myself, that's not Ben Affleck.  I've always said, oh, there's Ben Affleck.  He memorized all his lines. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  I think I've seen him in a couple of things I liked.  I mean, when you do.  Fucking Gary.  Just looking at him.  He's the greatest.  He's out there signing a couple of things.  A giant Harry Potter thing.  Like, he's been in, like, huge franchises as well as tiny movies.  And he's just not, like, a douchey, like, celebrity.  He's an actor.  Yeah.  And there aren't many.  Like, you were talking about comparing him to Brando and stuff.  Yeah.  There aren't many actors left.  Everybody's a celebrity, you know? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, and I meant that, too, because of the way he commits to every accent and every role.  Like, when you would watch Brando, and he's, like, you know, Mutiny on the Bounty or Young Lions.  Like, we played a German.  And he was always somebody different in these different movies.  And, you know, Oldman is the same.  I mean, every time you see him, he's giving us the salute as he takes off.  Yeah, he was tremendous.  I wonder if he stays in character between takes.  I should have asked him that.  Like, it seems like when you're working with an accent like that, it would be impossible to drop it, go back to your regular, and then come back. 
[03:51:00]  Look, I want to know, does he stay in character in between takes, Gary Oldman?  Go shout down the hall and say, hey, Gary.  No, don't yell.  Don't yell.  He's down that way if he's still there.  I don't know.  He's so good, dude.  Drexel, I'm glad he liked that role.  It reminds you that there are good actors.  Like, because when some people, like, you know, Hollywood stars or whatever, you just watch them, you're like, okay. 
[03:51:30]  I mean, he's good looking, and I understand why he's there, but it's not exactly rocket science.  When he does it, it's a different deal.  He's a different guy.  It's like when I see Brad Pitt in a movie, I just don't like him.  I know I'm in the minority.  A lot of people love Brad Pitt.  I think he's awful.  He never, he ruined Inglourious Bastards for me.  Like, his part ruined it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Up against the guys he was, like, he was in the scenes with that German dude.  Wasn't that the guy who played the German Hans?  Right, right, right.  He was great.  Fuck, we won the Oscar. 
[03:52:00]  What about, you don't like Leonardo DiCaprio.  I don't say that.  He's okay.  Anyway, I love him in certain things, and I think he's miscast in a few things, because  he's so famous and so handsome.  What do you like him in?  Titanic, he was very good in Basketball Diaries.  Catch me if you can.  Gilbert Greep.  What's he being Gilbert Grape?  Gilbert Greep.  Catch me if you can, he was very good in.  So you like him younger.  Because the thing, the only, I love Leonardo DiCaprio, but the problem is that he looks so  young.  Yeah.  In a lot of movies, he looks like he's wearing his dad's suit. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, I've heard that before.  Huh?  What did you say, Eric?  You're talking like that in the...  He's 18 feet from the mic.  He's like that in the Basketball Diaries.  If you see the promos and the trailers, he looks like he's wearing his dad's suit.  How old is he supposed to be in Basketball Diaries?  I don't know.  Young.  Maybe he's actually wearing his dad's suit, then.  Maybe.  He's supposed to be young in that movie.  Yeah, he's supposed to be kind of young.  He's a young boy.  You fool.  Yeah.  He really blundered there.  Where's John Walsh?  They said a minute.  Roland keeps saying a minute and then running out of the room.  He'll be here in a second. 
[03:53:00]  This is Roland's little game, though.  I want to do a fucking scene with Gary Oldman.  Well, you should have asked him.  He's gone now.  Hey, what's that thing you're holding there?  You think he's good with improv?  You think he could bounce off you well?  Yeah.  Because the thing about improv is you're only as good as your partner, and I know how good  you are.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  The case is not closed.  My gun and badge are on the line here.  You just break every rule.  Gary would start, and you'd just answer, no.  Or, I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Or we said something like, what do you think about this case? 
[03:53:30]  What do you mean?  I'm a painter.  You've got to take control of the situation.  Yeah, I would just completely...  You're never supposed to say no in improv.  I would just say no.  Like David Brent in the British office in the scene with the hotel clerk, that famous  scene where he's just completely...  The entire time, he's trying to make sure that he's the one in charge, and he's just  going to change whatever the scenario is to make sure it's him, because he's an obnoxious  asshole.  Neil Sedaka is going to be here later, too.  I wish I could stay around.  I cannot.  It's very random, the people that come through these hallways. 
[03:54:00]  I do have...  Although, I certainly understand what Opie Express's annoyance at certain things a company  does, because he's right.  But there is a fun part of working here that I really do love, and I think he would agree  with that.  The celebrity pictures?  Yeah, it is.  I don't know why I had to say it like I was masking it.  Yeah, you're right!  Funny you should say that, so I never considered that.  That's the element.  Oh, yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  David.  Intern David.  All right, what's John Walsh doing?  Taking a dump?  Eric's pointing to something. 
[03:54:30]  He's right there, but he stopped.  What's he...  Well, is Roland or Spencer bringing him?  Just tell him to pick him.  Oh, my God.  Well, tell him to bring him.  Eric, you might have to take charge of this situation.  What are they doing?  By the way...  Look, we only haven't talked to him for five minutes.  Taking photos?  We've got shows to do.  We've got shows to do.  But the show's going to be over soon.  Why are we taking photos when we...  I mean, I'd do it.  But come on.  What the fuck?  Jim's in here.  There's nobody possibly valuable enough that could be taking these photos.  Plus, we're now stalling longer than the actual interview is going to be.  Yeah. 
[03:55:00]  I understand taking pictures, but we're over in 23 minutes.  Yeah.  We're trying to help you, John, on a platform bigger than the one you just talked on.  Where is he?  I mean, he doesn't know what's going on.  They're just telling him what...  What's going on now, Eric?  Sex?  Roland and Liam and other people are there with him, but John keeps stopping to talk to anybody  that's in the hallway, so...  Tell him there are people in here that want to talk to him with an audience.  We did.  They're doing their best to get him down.  Come on.  We've got to...  Let's go.  I'm just fucking yapping.  Exactly.  What have you got to talk about?  Same show.  It's been on forever. 
[03:55:30]  Come on.  Where is he?  Eric's looking out in the hallway.  There's some old lady down at the end of the hallway.  Who's down at the end of the hallway?  We'll just have them grab him because literally...  Oh, Jim wants...  He was just...  I want to interview the guy because I actually like him a lot, and I really...  Oh, my God.  Jason in Pittsburgh was also way more excited for CM Punk.  Isn't that fascinating?  Than Gary Oldman?  Yeah.  I guess if you're a big wrestling fan, sure.  He did win the championship, by the way. 
[03:56:00]  I was happy for that.  And he knows who you are.  He's a fan of yours.  You know, it is.  Gary, CM, my friends.  Is that what you call him, CM?  Yeah.  It's not uncomfortable at all.  Here he comes.  Is this him?  No, I don't know.  Yes, there he is.  Yes, he is.  Okay.  He's coming in.  I can hear his voice.  Adam Walsh.  Hi, John.  How are you?  What did I say?  Hi, John.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  How are you?  It's a good pleasure.  Sit down, whatever you want.  Tell me...  I'm going to come over there and shake your hand.  Please do, John. 
[03:56:30]  It's a pleasure.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you, too.  We were talking about you before you came in, and we're happy that we have to wrap up  in like 20 minutes.  We want to get you in just to help promote the show, because I'm very psyched that it's  back on the air, because it's not just an interesting or fun show to watch.  It's a public service.  Well, I'm thrilled to be going to Lifetime.  I was shocked in last May when Fox decided to take us off primetime.  We were their first hit.  23 years there.  Caught almost 1,200 guys, and we had our highest ratings in 10 years. 
[03:57:00]  And I was really surprised by the...  Kevin Riley is the guy that I've been through, I think, 10 network presidents, but he's the  10th, and he decided to take the show off the air.  And, you know, there's always the big public outcry and the backlash, and I'm doing some  specials for Fox.  But the good people at Lifetime said, we get it.  We get your show.  We want you to come.  We want you to be on Friday nights, 9 o'clock, and we support everything you do. 
[03:57:30]  I'm really thrilled.  It's kind of a new paradigm for me and a new experience, but we've, even this summer when  we weren't on for the first time in 23 years, we caught five guys from our website alone.  Oh, really?  People never stopped calling the 800 number or going to the website.  And your books, by the way, Tears of Rage, I read, and I don't remember the name of the  follow-up, but the follow-up was also great.  I appreciate that.  And you really hit this emotional, because people know your story and how terrible you  came to do this, and there's something about you that just really resonates with people, 
[03:58:00]  and people love you.  Well, I think people identify.  I mean, we're a country that has 40 million crime victims every year.  I mean, this is the wonderful, beautiful country, America, with all the freedoms, but  we have a huge amount of crime, and we have a huge amount of violence in this country.  And I figured out years ago, I didn't figure out.  It wasn't my idea how the people could fight back without being vigilantes, about getting  justice for people, and catch the worst of the worst. 
[03:58:30]  I mean, we have caught 17 guys off the FBI's 10 Most Wanted.  We have caught guys in 35 countries, some of the worst serial killers and predators, because  people, they want to do the right thing.  I think if you give people a great personal risk.  What's the website?  Is it johnwalsh.com?  AMW.com.  Oh, AMW.  AMW.com.  And we get millions of hits.  And I think we're usually the second or third most popular TV website in the world.  And I give people a chance to say, don't tell me your name. 
[03:59:00]  You can remain anonymous.  No cop's going to come to your house.  I remember when Ronnie Chasen was murdered, the Hollywood publicist, a few months ago.  Oh, she was shot, right?  Right.  In her car, right?  Yeah.  Right in Beverly Hills.  Yeah.  I never got so many calls from heads of studios and agents and saying, John, saddle up.  Beverly Hills PD don't have a clue who killed Ronnie Chasen.  Could there be, you know, the horrible murder loose in Beverly Hills?  I aired the show.  Get a call.  Very, very scared tipster says, I live in kind of a rundown place. 
[03:59:30]  I'm down on my luck.  I think the shooter's here.  He doesn't leave his name or address.  He calls back.  One of my hotline operators say, John, this guy wants to talk to you.  I don't really talk to the tipsters, and I'm not at the hotline.  I call him back and say, you can do the right thing.  And he says, I'm afraid.  I'm afraid of retribution.  But I give the address.  I trust America's most wanted.  Wouldn't you know?  They circle back.  The cops are waiting for this guy.  He shows up to this apartment.  They got him surrounded. 
[04:00:00]  He kills himself.  Right.  But if you remember that.  Yeah.  And it solved this case.  And then they had to wait for the ballistics and all the conspiracy theorists and all the  tabloids come up with their bullshit.  But it was the guy in the ballistics match.  But it was the public who saddled right up and solved Ronnie Chasen's murder right away.  Isn't it great when they save you the money from it?  When a guy does exactly what he should do.  Oh, my gosh.  You know, it took 27 years to solve Adam's case by constant badgering by my wife and I, 
[04:00:30]  by my wife going out and getting a pro bono detective who was a friend of mine and a pro  bono former DA to reopen the case and a wonderful new chief to solve the case.  Otis Toole, you believe it was?  Otis Toole, without a doubt.  The FBI believed for years and they just blew the case.  And it took 27 years for them to man up and apologize to us and say, yes, if Otis Toole was  alive, we would have indicted him.  He died on death row, not for Adam's murder, but he died of AIDS and cirrhosis.  But these guys, it's we, I'm not a vigilante and I believe in, I believe in innocent until proven guilty. 
[04:01:00]  I believe that the evidence has to be overwhelming.  I'm a great believer in DNA, but we keep guys on death row for 20 years.  It costs millions and millions and millions of dollars.  I think every death row case should, if there's DNA, it should be reopened and unequivocally  decided whether this guy is guilty or not.  And then do what other countries do. 
[04:01:30]  Two years, three years.  I know we've executed people that are innocent, but it's just, it's a process that dehumanizes  the victims and the bad guys are in there watching color TV and talking to their lawyer  for 20 years while your wife that's been skinned alive by this guy has been dead.  And, you know, it's, it's, it's, and I'm not, I'm not advocating vigilante ism.  I, I, I, you express, John, you express, this is why people like you to, you express the  anger of a, of a father whose son was murdered.  You don't come from a detached, uh, talking head point of view. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, we have to, you express the anger as well, which I think really makes people feel connected  to you.  Yeah.  I mean, uh, for years I was the angry, bitter heartbroke.  I mean, I'm still the heartbroken dad and that, that I'll always be the father murdered  child, but I was that bitter, angry guy.  And then I figured out, you know, that you, you change things through legislation by good  legislation and you change things.  We got the Amber Alert passed.  We got the missing children's bill passed.  We got other people to saddle up and help us with legislation to direct that anger. 
[04:02:30]  But yeah, I w I was there for years, that bitter, bitter, very angry, you know, miserable  person.  And then I, you know, I think it was my wife that focused us in and said, you know, John,  we, we forget who the real victim was.  Adam was the real victim.  Maybe we could change things and maybe we could make it harder for these guys to do  or what they do or make it easier to, for parents to get help or to maybe be proactive and make  it safer for children. 
[04:03:00]  How is there like, how is there a recidivism rate?  Like, I don't know how they let them out or a great movie, a great show like with Chris  Hanson.  Yeah.  It was a little cheesy.  He'd walk in, but you know what?  These are guys who are trying to fuck kids and people said, oh, it's entrapment.  You can't entrap somebody to want to fuck a kid who wouldn't do it.  It's like, it was a great show and public pressure or a pressure from being sued or whatever.  They took it off.  You know, we live in the most litigious society in the history of man.  And I, I've read so much about it.  Our lawsuits in this country are 600 times greater than the closest country, which is West 
[04:03:30]  Germany, I think in England.  So everybody is so politically correct and so afraid of being sued, et cetera.  But the rate of recidivism, I, I've been hunting pedophiles for multiple years.  They'll tell you that it's incurable.  It's a, it's a compulsion.  I've done many guys that have gotten out to hurt children again, to kill again.  I've profiled many guys that were, you know, the chess teacher.  They were the soccer coach.  They were like the guy at Penn state.  The uncle.  The uncle creates a charity to cherry pick into like a private hunting ground. 
[04:04:00]  It is a compulsion.  And until we figure out how to cure them, because not every one of them was abused or molested.  Right.  It's a compulsion until we figure out how to cure them, how to change their brain, what  happened in their family life, et cetera.  I know one thing.  They have the highest rate of recidivism and children are at risk and they will do it again  because it's a compulsion.  So we have to figure out how to separate them from society or at least, and that was the  Adam Walsh act was for when president Bush signed four years ago in the Rose garden was 
[04:04:30]  to track the worst of the worst.  We have 100,000, the U S marshals in the justice department say that there are 100,000 level  three, not the kid who peed at Mardi Gras, not the 16 year old kid who had consensual sex  with a 15 year old girl.  He's black.  His father, she's white, not the Romeo and Juliet.  These are rapists and child molesters, repeat offenders who have cut off their ankle bracelet  or who have violated their parole or probation at large. 
[04:05:00]  A hundred thousand of them.  Why not put that as the top priority?  Why not hunt those bastards down?  Get them off the streets.  Let you guys know if you have kids or you have a nephew or niece are coming over that this  guy lives down the street.  He's a level three rapist.  He's a level three sex offender.  I think that's a simple right that we need to know.  So where these guys are, cause you can't lock them up forever.  Although I would, I don't know why you can't, I would throw away the key.  I think the only pedophile that deserves mercy is, is, is, is the one that actually says, 
[04:05:30]  Hey, look, I'm, no one is catching me and turns himself in voluntarily and says, you guys  didn't know I was doing this, but I need help.  That's the guy who deserves help.  Let me tell you something quick.  Sweden, socialized, sophisticated, highly educated country, castrates, physically castrate, sex  of second offender, rapist and pedophiles.  You know why?  They said a sophisticated country like us, we haven't figured out how to cure them, but  we want to make our women and children safer.  So we castrate you, second offender.  That's Sweden. 
[04:06:00]  That's fantastic.  Interesting.  Interesting.  It is great that there's one outlet, like you said, in this litigious society that's  human.  Like the America's Most Wanted is the one place that people can just react like human beings  and try to just have good guys stop bad guys.  It's coming back this Friday, right?  On Lifetime.  On Lifetime.  I'm thrilled to be on Lifetime.  The people at Lifetime really get the show and we're going to kick some butt.  It kicks them at 9 o'clock on Friday night.  Still doing some special for Fox.  I love Fox, but they cut me loose. 
[04:06:30]  So my new home is Lifetime and I appreciate your guys' support.  I hope people have watched.  We have caught the worst.  I'm doing some really tough cases this Friday.  Some really tough cases and we need the public support.  Well, that's great.  Thank you so much for stopping by, John.  We love you and we love what you do.  You're the best.  Nice to meet you guys.
