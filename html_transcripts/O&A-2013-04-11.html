<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The show opened with Anthony describing a debilitating cough he blamed on a subway pole and recounted a near-miss with a toll booth attendant after honking at a slow driver. This led to a discussion of a message board where toll booth workers apparently discussed him negatively.  The hosts then joked about their promotional photo for TBS and their relationship with SiriusXM management. A toll booth attendant called in, confirming the message board and the negative comments.

The conversation then jumped to Anthony's recent *Sopranos* viewing, upcoming guests Drea de Matteo and Dan Aykroyd, a recent lightning storm, the Masters tournament,  Anthony Weiner's political downfall, a teacher accused of statutory rape, a Pittsburgh mayoral candidate with facial tattoos and a DUI, and a vice mayor who repeatedly exposed himself while driving.  The hosts peppered these discussions with vulgar language and sexual references.

The show continued with a news story about a man masturbating while driving, followed by a discussion of how differently such an incident might be treated if the perpetrator were female.  A caller, "Wes the trucker," shared a story about a woman driving topless and bottomless, eliciting reactions from the hosts.  A significant portion of the segment was dedicated to mocking *Caddyshack 2*, specifically Randy Quaid's performance.  This segued into discussions of Seth Green's reactions to criticism, the show's own successful "Chip Meets the Bird People" video, and a scathing review of a UTI commercial.  A large portion involved mocking *Covino and Rich*, their catchphrases ("Brocabulary"), shirts, and perceived attempts by Rich to distance himself from controversial elements of their show.  They discussed their recent appearance on *Covino and Rich*, highlighting perceived tensions and speculating about a possible feud.  The recurring mention of upcoming guests Dan Aykroyd and Drea de Matteo punctuated this segment. Dennis Falcone contributed a bit, and Lionel, a local news weatherman, was also mentioned.

The next segment began with mockery of local news personality Tom Fitzpatrick's appearance and voice.  This led to a critique of a news story about someone who stole their grandmother's car and fled to Cuba, with criticism of WPIX News.  The bulk of this segment focused on a $500 HBO giveaway contest to promote Louis C.K.'s special. The hosts, along with Dennis Falcone, tried to develop a scheme involving a sound effect ("the cash cow moves") and E-Rock, who they persistently and offensively pressured to participate.  Numerous callers offered suggestions, but the contest details remained unresolved.  Dan Aykroyd then arrived as a guest, discussing his Crystal Head Vodka, his career highlights (including *Trading Places*, *Caddyshack 2*, and *My Girl*), his time on *SNL*, and his views on government mishandling of funds. He gifted the hosts bottles of his vodka.

Aykroyd's interview continued, delving into anecdotes about working with John Belushi and John Candy, the challenges of promoting films he disliked, Belushi's substance abuse struggles, and his own lifestyle choices.  He discussed the evolution of comedy writing and offered acting advice.  Following the interview, the show featured comedic bits, including a segment about Jim Norton's sobriety, a discussion of 1987 songs, a pre-recorded bit with an intoxicated E-Rock, a crude poem by "Uncle Paul," and a clip of Kobe Bryant discussing assaulting a coach.

The final segment showcased heavy banter, discussions about social media follower counts, and in-studio guest comedian Mike Racine.  The hosts made bets on follower milestones and discussed the "Elevator Show" and planned pranks on E-Rock.  Racial slurs and offensive language were frequent, alongside sexually explicit stories from the hosts and guests. A phone call with Opie (initially mistaken for another caller) and discussion of his mixtapes followed.  The segment concluded with promotion of Racine's show and the "Elevator Show."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg Audio!  Antonio!  Amy!  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6am and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:00:30]  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point Simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting. 
[00:01:00]  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage. 
[00:01:30]  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Tie these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:02:00]  Yep.  Hi.  Hear this.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning, Anthony.  Oh, boy.  You don't sound good.  My voice is shot.  I'm fucking coughing like crazy.  Doing this.  A lot of that.  Laughing?  Yeah.  A lot of swallowing.  A lot of that.  A lot of this. 
[00:02:30]  A lot of that.  Yuck.  Not fun, man.  You're supposed to get sick in the winter.  No, this is the second annual.  If you remember, this is just about the time of my whooping cough sickness,  which I don't think was whooping cough,  but it was a bad fucking cough.  And that was like exactly a year ago.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, so this is a great annual event, I guess. 
[00:03:00]  Fun, fun, fun.  Something happens to Anthony and the seasons change.  Yeah, maybe it's an allergy thing that gets out of hand or something.  Ooh.  I don't really get allergies, but, you know, maybe one day a little stuffy or sniffly or  something like that.  But this just fucking...  This is...  I attribute it to grabbing onto that fucking Subway Petri dish fucking thing you hold on  to on the way to the Yankee game when I went.  The Subway?  Yeah, the Subway is just a disgusting...  You hold on to the greasy fucking... 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, you got it.  I don't even know what you call it.  I mean, they used to be called straps, but they're not straps anymore.  They're kind of like...  Straffanger.  I'm a straffanger.  They're just fucking poles now.  Yeah, now they're just metal fucking disgusting bacteria fucking virus Petri poles.  Nothing worse when you have to grab onto one of those and you just feel like it's just greasy.  Slimy.  Yeah, slime.  Slimy.  Yeah.  It's like Vaseline and sweat.  Just not good.  Just disgusting.  And then there's... 
[00:04:00]  And when I was on there, it doesn't have to do with getting sick or anything, but it's  just fucking annoying.  Some fucking fat lump of shit just leaning against it.  Like the pole, the one that's vertical, standing there.  And he's leaning against it.  Yeah.  Like it's a wall.  People are supposed to hold onto it, and now you can't get your hand in there because  he's fucking leaning against it.  Well, you...  You dumb fuck.  You usually put your ass crack right on the bar, and then you know you're going to lean  nice.  Oh, you can't lean on it. 
[00:04:30]  I think it's meant for holding onto.  It keeps people from holding onto it.  No, you got to lean on whatever you can, man.  Got to lean.  My entire fucking sick time off has been spent building up more of a hatred for people.  But you don't even leave the house.  Exactly.  How does someone hate so much?  It's amazing.  That doesn't even leave his house.  That's what's amazing to me.  It's...  I don't know how it's done.  You ought to do a blog called The Angry Hermit.  You're like a hamster in hamster trails, but you hate. 
[00:05:00]  You're not even among the people.  It's so rare.  I just...  I have an influx of information that comes in on the TV.  Who are you hating these days?  And I'm just...  Everybody.  Same people?  Every single person on the face of the earth, I think.  I just...  Well, maybe not that many, but...  No, I just...  It's the usual suspects, and then...  And then just fucking... 
[00:05:30]  The people in the news...  Ugh.  Ugh.  And now I gotta deal with the fucking Midtown Tunnel people.  What happened?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Apparently, the Bridge and Tunnel people have a fucking message board.  Really?  Yeah.  And what happened?  They put a...  What is going on?  They put a bolo out for me.  What's a bolo?  Be on lookout.  So what does that mean?  I don't know.  They're looking for me.  What made they heard you talk about it in the air?  They did.  Oh.  Well, fuck you.  What am I guilty of?  I paid my toll, and I drove through. 
[00:06:00]  They have a message board?  You cocksucker.  Oh, dude.  It's the most pathetic thing.  Is Toll Taker 3 after you?  Exactly.  Here's what their message board is.  They bitch and bitch and bitch about the toll people that are taking the tests and various  things to get on the real police force.  Okay.  And they talk about what assholes those people are.  For trying to better themselves?  Yeah.  And then the special ops unit that actually is in charge of checking out the toll plazas, 
[00:06:30]  but they're also real cops.  Right.  They can't stand them and call them, like, incompetent.  And meanwhile, they're being replaced by a two-by-three-inch piece of plastic.  But what's...  I don't even know the story, so...  That's when I went through the toll booth.  Was I here?  I don't remember hearing this.  Maybe this was the time you were...  So what happened?  Well, I go through the toll booth, and there's a guy in front of me.  Right.  And he stops.  And I'm like...  At the gate?  Yeah.  Okay.  Motherfucker, man. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  So, bap!  I unload on the horn.  Right.  Of course, what are you going to do?  Sit there patiently?  Fuck you.  So, I look around.  I can't see.  But now one of the cop guys, toll guy, whatever the fuck they are, peeks around the car I just  beeped at, and he was standing in front of the car.  So, the reason that car didn't move...  He had to stop.  It was a minivan, so I couldn't see around.  Oh, he had to stop because he was going to hit the guy.  Right, right, right.  Gotcha. 
[00:07:30]  So, I'm like, oh, okay.  Now I realize.  So, the guy gets out of the way.  The gate opens, and that guy drives through.  And this motherfucker now starts walking over during the time I'm moving to stop me.  For beeping?  Yeah.  Now, obviously, I know what this is going to entail.  A fucking, what do you call that?  Brow beating.  A brow beating by this fucking overpaid fucking meter maid that's going to sit there and now 
[00:08:00]  yell at me for beeping and stuff.  He's not going to be able to do anything because all I did was beep.  That's the thing.  He's not going to write me up.  He's going to get his fucking, get his jollies because he's got to stand there all fucking  day by yelling at me for beeping because I didn't see past the minivan.  Right.  So, I'm like, fuck this.  Whoop.  I just gas it and go right past him.  I look at my rear view and I could tell he wanted to fucking, he was pissed.  What's the problem?  He has no authority to stop you, I don't think. 
[00:08:30]  He could have stopped me there and yelled at me for beeping.  But he doesn't have authority to actually stop you like a cop.  If a cop is kind of.  Oh, and once I passed him?  Yeah.  Fuck no.  No.  Sorry, get back in your booth.  But he doesn't have authority at all is what I'm saying.  If I was pulling something dangerous.  Right.  He could have stopped me and probably written me up for some kind of fucking thing.  Okay.  And I told this story last week or at some point.  Right.  Well, then they got on their little message board, their little message board and started  saying that, be on the lookout for Anthony Cumia from the Opie and Anthony show, who implicated 
[00:09:00]  myself on fucking zipping past and almost hitting the man.  It's like, fuck you.  Just fuck yourself.  Get back in your fucking phone booth, you cocksucker.  So there's their tbtarant.com.  Oh, yuck.  But it's, I was able to get on it, but now you got to like join. 
[00:09:30]  I guess some of the fans of the show must have gone on and maybe had a field day, wrecked  it for everyone.  So I fucking, I fucking like, like read that.  Now it's like, and then one guy goes, well, he's got a black escalade.  So, so watch that.  He comes in at 515.  Oh, they gotcha.  He comes, oh, he's been taking the Queensborough Bridge out of the city to avoid us.  But laziness will, laziness will win out and he'll be back at the top. 
[00:10:00]  Like, what the fuck am I?  Go to the tunnel.  Oh, you fucks.  Did you go through the tunnel today?  I certainly did.  Okay.  So, right through.  So you're not really on the lookout then.  No, and I'm fucking looking around and no one's there anyway.  No.  Why?  Well, perished the thought they open up another fucking lane or something.  There's one fucking easy pass lane opened up in the morning.  And then one guy will saunter out, gut jiggling, and he'll saunter out and lift another gate. 
[00:10:30]  Boy, those fucking tall plaza people, they don't even know how to move.  You ever see when they go to do something like, like somebody's easy pass didn't work  and they come over to fucking get it and, and to, have you ever seen someone move in  fucking slow motion?  It's like Sam Peckinpah's fucking directing it.  He, he, he, he's, he grabs the fucking easy pass.  I'll get the gate open for you. 
[00:11:00]  I'm having a problem with your easy pass.  Fucking take that thing and get traffic moving.  That's good job.  I'm watching you in amazement this morning.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  You're an angry, uh, an angry man. 
[00:11:30]  Holy shit.  I can't fucking handle it.  But you don't really have to handle people.  No, I gotta, I gotta handle them.  I gotta handle those people.  No, you just drive through easy pass now.  Uh, well, unless, you know, somebody in front of me, theirs doesn't work.  You had a little incident.  It's okay.  And then the fucking guys decided.  It's gonna be all right.  It's gonna be okay.  All right.  Are you kind of excited you made their message board?  Yeah, it is a thrill to make that message board. 
[00:12:00]  I felt like I was reading the fucking radio dentist again.  At least, at least somebody's talking about us.  That's great.  Yeah, there you go.  Wait, who does?  We don't get much press these days.  It's good to, it's good we're on that message board.  Why did they, you're on that message board.  Why did they put, I got so annoyed when I saw the fucking picture you tweeted.  What's that?  For TBS.  Did somebody, did you fucking photo?  Was that a mistake or was that a different?  No, that's only, um, that's only, I don't know.  I haven't been in any of the promotional material for the show yet.  But my episode's really late, so I don't know.  I have no idea.  I'm gonna ask these guys to ask them, because it's a little weird. 
[00:12:30]  No, but the picture that I, uh, that's not everybody from the show.  Oh, okay.  Two, four, six, eight, nine, nine.  No, there's like 27 of us.  Oh, shit.  So that's only a third.  Maybe that's who they could get that day.  No, those are all individual photos that they just put together.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  How naive am I?  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  What do you think?  They got them all there.  For a second, I did.  I'm just a boy.  Who gets the last laugh on TBS starting April 16th? 
[00:13:00]  My episode's, uh, June 2nd, the last episode of the season.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  Oh, maybe like every month or something, they put on the new, a new shitload of people.  That's what I'm hoping.  Maybe those are the people that are in the earlier episodes.  That's what I'm hoping.  I don't know.  Tom Green?  Because I'm not famous.  That's why.  Those guys, you know those faces.  That's not true.  We're famous in the radio world, but that's not saying much.  I know DL and I know Tom Green's face.  I don't know who the other people are.  You got Andy Dix up there and Ben Margera and Sherry Oteri. 
[00:13:30]  And what's her name?  The comic that fucking puts the gloves on.  Oh, Natasha Leggero.  Yeah, she's there.  And that's, uh, Schlesinger.  Oh, all right.  So a lot of our friends in this.  So I know all of them except the, uh, the, the...  Who's the black guy with his arms folded?  That's the dude from Scrubs who hosts the show.  Okay.  I always forget his name.  And who's the other guy?  Well, DL, of course.  And there's one guy I don't know, so...  Who's that, uh, yeah, who's that guy next to DL, the white guy? 
[00:14:00]  I don't know.  I don't know why I'm asking the radio order if they can't see it.  I apologize.  Yeah, I don't know who that guy is, so...  Who knows?  You know, it's...  Hopefully it's just, uh...  I don't know.  Then I wonder maybe people at TBS don't like us and all that shit.  Who the fuck knows?  They care about promoting.  I really think, because, you know, I'm not that famous.  You want people that, you know, that they know. 
[00:14:30]  We're just not known.  We're just not known after all these years.  We sit there and go, who's that guy between Tom Green and...  I know, the one guy.  Whatever.  We'll see what happens.  I like the fact the entire show is having a fucking self-esteem meltdown.  Oh, no, I'm fully aware of where I'm at.  We were almost famous ten years ago.  Almost.  We almost made it.  I think the show's in better shape than that.  No, we're good in the radio world, but, you know, we all pretty much don't give a fuck  about the radio world anymore, let's be honest with each other. 
[00:15:00]  We want to be doing other things.  We could do this all day long.  All day long.  You know.  Because we have a shitty agent, and we have shitty people around us here.  I mean, period.  So it makes it very, very difficult to do anything else.  I haven't heard from my agent in months.  He's a shitty agent at this point.  And he knows it.  That's why I think he avoids us.  That's why I'm in today, to not hear from him.  I figured if I pushed it, the phone would be right.  At this point, he doesn't even call anymore. 
[00:15:30]  He knows.  You sound bad, though.  Like, you sound sick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're not fucking...  Edgar doesn't buy it, but I think you are very sick.  I can hear it.  I can see it in your face.  Oh, it's so bad over the past couple of days.  Yeah.  You know when someone's bullshitting, and then you look at them, and you know when they're sick.  You just know.  Oh, right.  That's sick.  It was fucking...  I hope you get stopped at the toll today.  You know what?  All cranky and coughing.  I might.  I will just be like, what?  What?  I don't know what they could do.  You can't do something. 
[00:16:00]  What?  What can they do?  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  I'm a fugitive for 100 feet.  100 feet of a fucking toll plaza.  I'm a fugitive.  What is it?  They have their own country?  Yeah, that's it.  That's their fucking jurisdiction.  The Vatican.  Yeah, they're like the Vatican.  The Vatican.  You fucking messes.  How great would it be if they pulled him in and did a strip search and did like a Justin  Volpe on him?  Two toll takers of just sodomizing him with a fucking stick.  Yeah, and one guy's like, you know, be courteous, because he'll probably tape it for the show 
[00:16:30]  on the message board.  And oh, by the way, he has a concealed carry permit.  What am I, Sonny Corleone?  You dunces.  I hope so.  I think secretly you like this.  Ah, no.  I think secretly you kind of like the attention.  You're liking the attention, aren't you?  Well, it was funny.  I thought it would be funny, and I thought, you know, bringing it to the show would be  entertaining. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  A little.  But no, it's like it makes me just go like, ugh.  Why don't you fucking shut up?  Why don't you really fuck him over and just like throw your Escalade away and just start  driving a brand new car?  Someone said that.  Yeah, get a new car.  And then they'll be lost.  One guy rats me and rats me out, whatever it is.  He's with his little cohorts.  He's like, he drives a black Escalade.  Or he's got a blue Mustang with white stripes.  Like, you even got that wrong, you dummies. 
[00:17:30]  Be on the lookout.  Alert.  Alert.  All cars.  Calling all cars.  Be on the lookout.  Sounds like you didn't really do much wrong.  No, I didn't do anything wrong, so whatever.  And there's nothing they could do.  What would he get?  Like, what is he going to?  Here's what would happen.  I would get fucking like, if this even ever happened, I would get like, come over here.  Over here.  And they'd wave you over.  So it was all important.  Wave you over. 
[00:18:00]  And then I'd get a brow beating.  I'd get yelled at.  You know what you do?  Well, let me tell you what happens in here on a daily basis.  And then I'll recite a few tragedies that have happened where fucking, you know, toll takers have been launched 50 feet.  Walking across the fucking, at a tortoise's pace across the fucking lanes.  And then, you know, and if this happens again, if we see you.  Shut up.  Please laugh.  That's what I don't need.  Through the entire story.  If he tells you about people who have been hurt, please laugh through the entire story. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but like you're sharing a joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like he's telling a joke.  That's a good one.  It's hilarious, dude.  I don't fucking, I am beyond that point of needing to be lectured about shit by people in this authority.  You know what I mean?  Like I understand.  And if I'm speeding and a cop pulls me over, I know the fucking game. 
[00:19:00]  I know I'm going to get fucking bitched at and I'm going to get a ticket and whatever.  I understand that portion of it.  But I don't understand where the only power base someone has is to yell at you like you're a fucking child and they're a teacher or a parent.  Blow me.  I'm not going to stand there at this point in my fucking life and have some guy that fucked up in his career yell at me and get his frustrations out at me. 
[00:19:30]  Fuck off.  I wish this was a movie because then the quick cut would be Anthony pulled over going, no, no, you're right, you're right.  That would be a hilarious scene.  Oh, would that be a funny scene?  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Okay, look, I'm sorry.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  I'm really sorry.  Never again.  You're right.  Well, there's people that have those jobs, though.  Hold on.  We got one of those people. 
[00:20:00]  Hitler, you're on the line.  John Doe.  Oh, dear.  I cannot give my regular name.  Hello?  Yeah, I don't feel like doing bits today.  I can't give you my regular name, dude.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, it's not a bit.  Go ahead.  No, it's definitely not a bit.  Anthony, you're going to be all right moving forward, all right?  So, yeah, you're going to look for the bald guy when you come to the easy desk.  You'll never have to worry again.  I put the alert out for all the boys and the idiots that I work with. 
[00:20:30]  There are a bunch of little rods, if you know what I mean.  You honestly work over at Midtown Tunnel?  Honestly, you can ask me any question.  I can give you all the details.  I can tell you what time you potentially came in if I go back to the video booth.  If you really want me to.  So what's with the fucking message board, most people?  Well, there's two people here that hate the show. 
[00:21:00]  And they kind of go out of their way to make sure they fucking bother the shit out of you.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of stuff that goes on here that you wish you would never know.  Well, I understand.  Why are people so fucking pissed at SOP?  Or SOD?  It's the worst job in the world.  I mean, give me a fucking break.  We do nothing.  We sit around and jerk off.  You know, now that EasyPass is here, we get to see people drive by us.  I mean, what do you want us to do? 
[00:21:30]  We're bored.  We want you guys to fucking reallocate your fucking resources and leave the fucking toll  plazas.  We need a guy like Jimmy.  We need Jimmy to come and take care of us.  Jimmy's toll booth collectors.  It's a great company.  I would just, if someone was going to give me a toll, I'd be like, what's it, a toll house  cookie or something, you know?  Fucking on fire.  You hear what I said?  I didn't see you.  All right, thank you, thank you, thank you, John Doe.  Thanks, John. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  Thank you.  I hope he's in the booth right now and someone's waiting for their change.  Some guy's stuck beeping.  Yeah.  He's ready to get yelled at.  I don't know, there is this mentality, though.  There's people that get this little authority thing, and then they yell at you or have to  lecture you on things.  At this point, I know when I've done something that's maybe skirting the issue, when I get  caught, I know I've been caught, I know that, and, you know, there's an agreement there 
[00:22:30]  that you understand what's gone on.  To have to sit there and listen to some guy rambling on about why you shouldn't have done  that, and to be like, no, no, I'm done.  I'm done.  I hit the accelerator.  I see you get smaller in my rearview mirror, and I'm home in no time.  I'm not going to stand there or sit there in my car and listen to that.  Sorry.  There you go. 
[00:23:00]  Whew.  Other than that, I watched a lot of TV.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Why did you say you had this hateful time where you're just reading bad stuff?  I can't go to the message board.  I can't do it.  No, no, I don't.  The nasty ones.  Not our people.  I mean, like, the fucking hate ones.  I don't go to them.  I don't mean these.  I mean, like, the harsh ones that show nasty videos.  Oh, yeah.  They just get me angry.  I can't do it.  Oh, I don't go to those.  I don't go to, like, violence ones.  Oh, I go there.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I mean.  Like that one.  Oh, that gets you angry? 
[00:23:30]  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I did it once, and it set me on a spiral for a week.  Really?  Yes.  I can't do it.  I just avoid that stuff.  I have to.  I just avoid it.  Oh, you know.  It's so much easier to just avoid that shit.  Yeah.  Any type of, it seems like any type of a message board, or any type of a site that is dedicated  to one cause will pile up examples of that one cause.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you just look at it like it's this overwhelming thing.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I'm sure if you went to a black site that was like, white people suck, and then  you have all these examples, you'd be like, what the fuck is wrong with white people? 
[00:24:00]  Like, what planet is this from?  Exactly.  We're terrible people.  Yeah, yeah.  And, well, I was also just watching The Sopranos over the entire time.  I think I'm up to season five already, in the middle of season five.  Wow.  I've just been fucking going at it.  And, obviously, the show's been off for quite a few years.  But a few observations.  When you watch it in marathon form for the first time since you've seen it when it was 
[00:24:30]  on the air, you do get a different perspective.  Remember how you looked forward so much to every episode?  Of course.  And you expected so much from every episode?  I remember being let down a lot.  Exactly.  No, I remember when it was on.  The expectation was so great that you absolutely were let down at times, going, fuck, I waited  a week for that?  Or I waited a year for that, for the show to start up again?  And you had to wait at least, yeah, another week to see what happened.  I completely remember that.  When you do the marathon thing, it takes that burden off of the episode. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, all of a sudden now, you don't look at every episode like, oh, God, this better be  great.  Every minute.  Every minute, you're like, ah.  Yeah, yeah.  You're looking at the clock going, like, there's only five minutes left in this episode.  What are they going to...  Like, that fucked the show up.  Because I'm noticing now...  I don't think it fucked up the show.  It did terrific.  It made it seem like...  But I understand your point.  Yeah.  A lot of the episodes, you were like, well, what the fuck?  When you watch it in marathon form...  Well, because you're a big...  You can lower your expectations. 
[00:25:30]  Yes.  Exactly.  No, you can't.  So, yeah.  And it definitely works.  Is it a good show?  Five years later?  Six years later?  Some seasons better than others.  I don't remember.  Obviously, episode to episode, some are much better than others.  It's a masterpiece, though.  I really did.  Watching it through the same way, I did a masterpiece.  But, yeah.  When you take that burden off of it, it's great.  You don't have to wait a year between seasons, at least, where you forget who did what.  You know they killed Tony at the end, right? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, fuck.  I don't know that, though.  Yeah, they definitely did.  And then you notice little things.  Like I said, there was another Journey song in one of the episodes.  There was?  Yeah.  Wheel in the Sky.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, they played that.  So, it's like, oh, okay.  Keep on turning.  And then you notice people, you know, like I was saying last time, you notice all these  people that fucking are in other shows and stuff, which is kind of interesting.  Omar was in an episode with Michael K. Williamson.  Omar was.  Michael K. was.  In season three with Jackie Aprio Jr. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, they put Jackie Jr. up in the projects at his house.  And he played chess with his daughter and then went out and got his fucking brains blown out.  And I thought Uncle Junior, when you look at his, it was fucking hilarious.  Junior is so fucking good.  God.  And I'm just at the point now where he really is losing his mind, getting Alzheimer's and  stuff.  But before that, he was, what a great character.  Oh, your sister's cunt.  Yeah.  Some of the shit he says. 
[00:27:00]  And then he's starting to lose his mind.  So, he's watching TV.  And he sees Curb Your Enthusiasm and Larry David.  And he's like, that's me.  I'm on TV.  It's Larry David with his glasses on his bald head.  And then they show Larry because it's Curb.  So, Larry's a manager.  What's his name?  And they show him.  He goes, and it's Bobby Bacala.  Oh, really?  Fucking hilarious.  Oh, it's funny.  There's a lot of really good scenes, too.  The fight between fucking Joey Pants and Tony was good. 
[00:27:30]  He sprays him in the eyeballs with Raid.  That was a sick fucking scene.  Yeah.  We got Drea coming in.  Drea DiMatteo, yeah.  Yeah, DiMatteo's coming in at 9.30.  I found Christopher to be hateable.  Like, when I watched it again, Christopher was hateable.  He was a great actor.  Michael Impero is a phenomenal actor.  Yeah, so that's why he was so hateable.  Fucking hated him.  He really was.  I think he was supposed to come across that way.  Yeah, absolutely.  Obviously, yeah.  And he played it amazing.  But even when he was likable, I didn't like him because of the way he treated her. 
[00:28:00]  Like, what a fucking hateable cocksucker.  And fuck it, you just feel bad for Artie the whole time.  Buko.  He was one of the best actors in the whole series.  Oh, my God.  The way he moves his hands with everything.  He got some of this coming up.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Trying to just be happy.  He's so on the outside of that whole world.  When he tried to be tough and collect the money from the guy, and he gets to shit beat  out of fry, baby.  Ah, he starts crying.  That was terrible.  In season six, you'll get to it again.  But there's a great...  It's one of my cringiest Soprano moments. 
[00:28:30]  It's great.  It's when Gandolfini is telling him, or whatever, he talks too much.  He wrecks people.  There's a moment where there's a table full of people, and they're talking.  And the guy is doing a joke to his little table mates.  And he's going...  So then the guy comes back, and fucking dumb Artie Buko comes over and goes, oh, you're  enjoying your meal?  You know, the sauce.  I prepared the sauce.  And he starts talking about the sauce.  And I'm like, oh, it was so perfectly done.  You're like, just shut up.  Shut up your mouth.  You're interrupting.  Shut up. 
[00:29:00]  It was so...  That's what makes that show great, is how they capture little...  Like, if you wrote that, and no one would look at that and go, that's an amazing moment.  Right.  It just looks like fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Really, you know...  And this show's been off for a while, and some of these episodes that you watch originally,  you realize that show started in 99.  Wow.  That's a long fucking time ago.  Wow.  14 years ago, right?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, you start watching...  Jesus Christ, this was a long time ago. 
[00:29:30]  And you remember, like, what was going on at the time?  Like, N.E.W. and shit.  Like, I'm watching some of these going, fuck, I remember...  That's early, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  That's early.  Yeah.  That's like our first year over there.  Crazy.  Damn.  Well, Dre DeMatteo coming in today at 9.30.  Also, Dan Aykroyd today.  Yep.  Ooh.  Promoting vodka.  Yeah, that Crystal Head vodka.  It comes in a big skull.  It comes in a big crystal skull.  Is it good shit? 
[00:30:00]  It is good shit, man.  I gotta say...  Isn't vodka vodka after a while?  I have it in my fucking...  Nah, vodka could be really bad.  Like, cheap fucking shit.  You put it in your drink.  It's terrible.  But...  Crystal Head vodka.  Crystal Head.  They won the gold medal for Excellent Taste at the 15th International Tasting Contest of the 2013 Prod Expo Exhibition in Moscow, Russia. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, they won an award in Russia for their vodka.  Yeah, Russia.  That's pretty impressive.  Yes.  Very good.  Fucking Ackroyd's a legend, man.  Yeah.  Hasn't done any big movies lately, but he's a fucking legend.  I like him.  I'm actually more psyched to talk to Dre DeMatteo, even though I like Ackroyd.  Than Ackroyd?  Yeah.  I really am, because she's one of the stars of one of my favorite shows of all time.  Well, let's tell Ackroyd to drop off some vodka and get the hell out of here.  But I'm not happy.  I actually like him, too.  I mean, I'm happy he's coming in.  What did they do that was a serious role recently, that was in the last few years, that I'm thinking of? 
[00:31:00]  I can't remember what I'm...  Oh, shit.  I don't know why I just asked that.  I don't know.  He pops up here and there.  I don't know.  It's hilarious that she's fucking coming in.  I know.  I'm happy.  That's good.  I've been watching Sopranos.  You're going to be ready for that one.  Totally, I'm watching it.  Cool.  You ought to say to her, hey, what are you doing?  Running a club or something?  Why would I say that?  You're going to get whacked or something? 
[00:31:30]  Why would I say that?  Hey, that's Tony.  What's the outside being?  Mr. Mafia or something?  Look, look, look.  Thanks.  Why would I say that?  Man, the fact that she is...  They went through a period of Sopranos where she's just in her bra and panties every episode.  They know.  She comes into the fucking apartment and gets undressed just naked.  Well, you know, bra and panties.  Right.  And just looking...  Ridiculous. 
[00:32:00]  Amazing.  Yes.  Fucking amazing.  And that whole storyline is just fucking crazy.  Right now, season five is where she is just chatting with the feds.  That scene where she vomits on the table.  Oh, God, that's great.  They got her and she just like...  She knows she's fucked.  She was tremendous in that.  She's a tremendous actress.  She's promoting some new series, I think, that's on...  Vodka?  No.  She's been working pretty steadily ever since the Sopranos, so... 
[00:32:30]  Cool.  How about that lightning last night?  Yeah, that shit was pretty righteous.  I didn't notice it.  No?  No.  Wow.  What the fuck?  You weren't near any windows.  It was all night long.  Oh, I don't...  It was probably for five, six straight hours.  Starting at what?  Like six, seven?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like you heard this low rumble coming.  Like, uh-oh.  Storm's coming.  Now, I've been seeing lightning for, you know, for many, many years at this point.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  And my young son saw it for the first time last night.  Oh, how'd he enjoy it?  And you just forget.  You have a little human.  You just assume he's seen everything you've seen.  Like I told you the story the first time we brought him to the Central Park Zoo.  It's like, he was blown out.  He didn't...  What are these things?  He's like, what the fuck?  I'm looking at monsters.  He doesn't get it like we get it.  You forget.  Yeah, it's hilarious, yeah.  So, there was the big, uh, that big white flash that was happening over and over again.  And he, his eyes got huge and he goes, Daddy, something just came out of the water. 
[00:33:30]  Out of the water.  He thought something was coming out of the water.  Oh, boy, can you twist a kid's mind at that point?  Yeah, yeah.  They come out of the water, yeah.  You realize you got a very important job at that moment.  Because you're right.  You could fuck him up.  You could make it so he never goes in the water again.  Or the toilet.  Oh, that's what happens in the toilet.  Right.  It's shocking and it comes out and hurts people.  Oh, my God.  Fast forward 30 years, fucking laying on his back. 
[00:34:00]  Some fucking broads shitting on him.  Wait a minute, that was me.  Wait a minute.  But he just doesn't understand.  And when he sees this shit for the first time, his little mind is like, what the fuck?  He's just, his mind is blown on a daily basis.  Jesus.  Daddy, something came out of the water.  It happened again.  And I'm trying to explain it to him.  But how do you even explain lightning to an almost three-year-old?  Oh, I tried.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just said, when it rains really hard, sometimes that happens.  You say, it's the angels bowling. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  All that shit.  Angels bowling.  Imagine, man.  Yeah.  That's like, I'm trying to think.  That's like, that's pretty much if aliens landed for us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  It has to be something you've never, ever, ever experienced before in your life.  And you can't wrap your head around it.  Randy, no.  That lightning was cool, though.  Yeah.  It was that lightning that, like, the sky lights up and it just stays lit up for a while.  Man.  Just flashing.  Whoa.  What the fuck?  Because of low cloud cover, I bet. 
[00:35:00]  Ooh.  Masters start today.  No one cares here.  Sorry.  I'm very excited, though.  Someone's got to help me out and then let me know how I can watch the whole fucking thing.  Because the Masters, they're just, everyone else thinks it's such a great tournament.  And it's, like, tradition and all that.  They're fucking assholes.  They're the one golf tournament where they hold back the coverage.  At this point, any golf tournament, you can watch every single fucking shot.  Not the Masters. 
[00:35:30]  They have to control everything.  Why is that?  So the coverage today, I mean, it's only four days.  The coverage today starts at 3 o'clock.  Tiger Woods tees off at 1045.  So guess what?  When they start their coverage, the main guy is already done.  That's how fucking pompous they are.  And then what, they just show you, like, highlights?  They can't fucking figure it out.  They show you some highlights?  And the other guys are still kind of on the course.  Oh.  You know, and then they have some online coverage.  But then they decide you can only watch these three holes.  And it's just pain-ass. 
[00:36:00]  There's not some channel dedicated to it?  The golf channel for every other tournament.  They just fucking, you know, it's on.  And then they move over to CBS or whatever the fuck has the tournament.  And they'll even tell you, like, well, our coverage ends, but starting in two minutes,  you get to go over to CBS for the rest of it.  But they don't do that for this one?  Not so much, man.  It's more of a pain in the ass.  Because they're all just hoity-toity assholes over there.  Hoity and toity?  Hoity and toity.  Jesus. 
[00:36:30]  Someone's calling.  Hopefully they have a way to watch this thing.  Oh, and I asked the company if they have a ticket.  Because it's been my dream to go check out the Masters.  Uh-huh.  They never got back to me.  And it's Steve Blatter.  I go, Steve, I want to go to the Masters this year.  I know we have connections.  I know SiriusXM has a golf channel, and I'm sure they're down there.  I even said I'd work it.  Like, I'd be a scrub.  I don't care.  Like, I would fucking run around with wires if I have to.  I really want to go.  He goes, oh, let me.  And he, like, texts someone. 
[00:37:00]  That was in our meeting, the last meeting, which was a while ago.  He never got back to me.  Yeah.  It starts today.  So you going?  Obviously not.  It would have been nice if he at least got back to me.  Jesus, man.  That's ridiculous.  We got a new guy at the helm, too.  Yep.  A Liberty guy is moving in.  Liberty.  To be the chairman of the board of SiriusXM.  That was kind of to be expected, right?  Not really.  No, not at all. 
[00:37:30]  No.  A lot of people were saying that they were going to, you know, run this as a separate  company, kind of like it was under the umbrella, but, you know, it was going to do its own  thing.  But they're moving one of the big guys right in.  So I think that could be really good.  As long as the guy likes us.  Who knows?  Yeah.  That's always the problem with this shit.  When's the last time there was a takeover where they spent more money?  I've never heard of a company taking over and spending more.  Yeah, I mean, but Liberty has all sorts of other things that maybe we could benefit from.  Medical supplies.  Or if it's a guy that just hates the show, then we're fucked. 
[00:38:00]  That's always been the case.  I guess that's the case in all business, right?  Yeah.  We went from having a guy that hated our fucking guts, Hugh Pinero, and then we were thrown  a miracle.  And then all of a sudden Eric Logan came in and, you know, he was still a corporate guy,  but he at least liked the show and supported it.  So we went from, holy fuck, we're fucked here. 
[00:38:30]  And then the other guy came in.  It was Hugh Pinero and then the black guy.  I say the black guy because I don't know his name.  I forget his name.  Nate Davis.  Nate was the one who came.  We had a meet with Nate.  Anthony decided to be 45 minutes late for the main guy at XM.  I'm making so many excuses.  I'm sitting there eating a stupid fucking...  Oh, for a meeting?  Yeah.  Remember at that hotel?  God.  Because you were so annoyed.  You didn't want to meet with him?  Oh, I so didn't want to meet with him. 
[00:39:00]  And then I got your point because as soon as the meeting started, another guy, man,  we've had this over the years.  His opening statement was, I just want to let you guys know, I completely agree with the  firing of Don Imus.  Yeah.  He prefaced the meeting with that.  Oh, my God, we're so fucked.  He prefaced the meeting with that.  It's like, now let's have our meeting.  I'm just thinking, fuck you.  That was his opening line.  Yeah.  With his tiny little thin mustache.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  And I'm like, holy fuck.  Great.  Another guy that doesn't get it.  Yeah.  Doesn't understand, you know, what radio guys go through.  And can't put his emotions away for a second.  It's like, great.  And then, you know, and Hugh Pinero's opening line was, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't,  I'm not a fan.  How was it?  He said something like, I'm not a fan of you guys, but I understand why the show is popular.  I'm like, oh, that's great.  That's a great way to start a relationship.  I'm sure he'll want to pour resources into the program with that attitude.  Yeah.  And then he also had to tell us that he was no Mel Carmisen. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, that's for sure.  Yeah.  Because Mel Carmisen was so bad for our careers.  Yeah.  I'm no Mel Carmisen.  Like, like we were getting away with murder with Mel Carmisen.  Are you kidding me?  He was right.  He has no Mel Carmisen.  We had many a sit down with Mel Carmisen where it wasn't pretty.  Yeah.  And he, of course, you know, get, you know, we had the big firing.  Yeah.  But Hugh wanted to make sure we knew that he was no Mel Carmisen. 
[00:40:30]  I ain't going to be putting up with any of your shenanigans.  Under, under Hugh's tenure, this fucking place.  What, what the fuck happened to XM during that whole period?  What a dummy.  They had a lead.  He really was a dope.  Oh.  A fucking dope.  They had a big lead, too.  So we'll see what happens with the new guy.  I have no idea, man.  Could be good.  Could be bad.  Whatever.  But that was, uh, that was news yesterday.  It's actually in the paper today.  Ooh. 
[00:41:00]  Hmm.  With the papers, the papers.  They thought a wiener may be running again.  It's impossible.  I don't know about that.  It's too fresh.  What is he thinking?  Stop it.  The paper, read the cover.  They're already making dick jokes right on the cover.  Well, that's, they're just, that's what the press does.  They're just shitty.  I mean.  And then they got a picture of him in his underpants, obviously with a, with a hard on.  Yeah, it might hurt him.  In his underpants.  It says, Anthony, uh, says, uh, erect, erect me, Mr. Mayor.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:41:30]  And then it's wiener's second coming.  It's just me.  Come on.  That's a cum joke.  They're making spunk jokes on the cover of the New York Post.  It's all tongue-in-cheek fucking puns.  Yeah.  He's gonna get slaughtered if he runs.  I'd vote for him.  Yeah.  He's gonna get slaughtered, though.  I mean, the people, the people aren't ready.  Yeah.  The people that actually will go and vote and, uh, you know, take care of all that shit.  Nah.  They're not ready.  Not at all.  Wow.  Fucking, uh.  How, how closely are you watching this teacher fucking story? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, what's that one?  The guy who banged a 14-year-old, allegedly?  Whoops.  He's being accused of it.  And what's funny is, he's out on $30,000 bail and he faces like seven years for like fucking  a 14-year-old repeatedly.  But if you steal money from a bank, it's 25 years automatically.  If you fuck a 14-year-old, you're seven years?  What did he, uh, what did he do?  What's the circumstance?  I, the, he's a teacher.  He, he was a predator.  Oh, man.  That's, uh, yeah.  If he did it, yeah.  I mean, they found...  He was a complete predator. 
[00:42:30]  He was, you know, he just kept going after this one over and over again.  Yeah?  And they got her?  They said that there was text messages found by her sister.  Like he was using a fake name and having the girl use a fake name or something on the phone.  But I guess that her sister found something and then told the parents.  Oh, boy.  So they arrested this guy.  And, uh, he's being charged, I think, with fucking her ten times or something.  That's what they said in the paper, at least.  At least ten times.  Damn.  That's a lot of trouble.  Oh, he's in, he's in Dutch. 
[00:43:00]  But to only be facing seven years.  How is that you only face seven...  Did the older sister get yelled at?  With a little tattletale?  Jesus.  What?  I mean, obviously they don't know if he did it or not, but that's just the allegation.  Yeah.  I mean, you decide to go down that road and then how the fuck do you sleep at night?  How do you sleep?  Just wondering when there's going to be a knock at the door.  Walking out the window.  Huh.  Huh.  Yeah, like you just sit there with your wife and you hear,  The police! 
[00:43:30]  No, honey.  No, what?  Oh, no.  I just woke up.  How the fuck?  Man, that urge has got to be strong where you just throw all that away because...  Caution to the wind.  I don't know how you live your life after that.  Oh, my God.  This is terrible.  Hold on.  I'm just storting.  Ah, there we go.  Boy, the throat is very important.  Just saying?  Yeah, once you...  That's a great thing to say, little girl, is you're holding the back of her head. 
[00:44:00]  Once you chew it all up, the coughing was horrendous the past couple of nights.  It sounded like Don Corleone in the fucking tomato patch.  You really think Anthony Weiner has a chance?  I don't know if he has a chance.  Not even a shot, man.  But I like...  He should have, like, went for something else before this.  Maybe, yeah.  He's a young guy, too.  He's a pompous ass, I think, which is his problem. 
[00:44:30]  Spitzer was.  Because even Spitzer can't fucking run without...  Yeah, but he did something illegal.  I mean, this guy lied, too, but I mean, like, when you're getting prostitutes, that's technically an illegal thing.  I think they're both...  Spitzer's been able to move on from it.  You know, he's had some...  Not where he was, though.  Nothing politically.  No, but I mean, he's been able to get, you know, gigs on TV and this and that.  At least he's rich.  He's rich.  Fucking, I don't know if Wiener's got that kind of money.  Wiener, I mean, they're going to make a complete joke out of this. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to get slaughtered, I'm telling you.  Well, unless...  No, he's going to get slaughtered.  Slaughtered.  It doesn't matter who else is running.  It's just too soon.  Comedians, talk show hosts.  Oh, they've already started.  It's just pure fodder.  Yeah.  Mother tool, right, Ant?  Ah, good one.  I know.  You think he's mad at us?  No, because he ultimately would have had to go anyway.  Anyway, this show, we talked about this on Reddit last night, just this show basically 
[00:45:30]  forced, you know, Pelosi's hand and forced them to get him out.  He was going anyway, though.  Yeah.  There's no way he was surviving the bare chest photos to another girl and his fucking crotch.  That was terrible.  There's no way he was surviving that.  His horrible dick.  His awful, not as big as you should be if you're going to send it out.  Cock.  See what's going on?  This is what we're talking about right now.  And so is everyone else.  But I wouldn't have been talking about him in any way, shape, or form without this, good  or bad.  And Breitbart was, he was showing that picture to everybody. 
[00:46:00]  It was just a matter of time.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  It was just a matter of time that was going to be out there.  We were just the lucky recipients that way.  Showed it to a couple of shock jerks.  Shock jerks.  We couldn't get our cameras out fast enough.  Oh, please, right?  He's going to get slaughtered, though.  That's not even open for discussion.  Well, then the people, like, if he deserves to get slaughtered politically, fine.  But are people going to judge him on that?  No, my point is I don't think he should get slaughtered.  But he's going to get slaughtered.  But I'm saying people deserve, well, yeah, we deserve dishonest politicians because now 
[00:46:30]  this is out and this is what this guy did.  And people don't want him.  They're all lying scumbags.  All of them.  You're not going to ever find a guy who matches, who can survive every bit of vetting.  But you want a guy that understands social media.  Yeah.  He didn't really understand how any of that worked.  Oh, my account was hacked.  I love that one.  Yeah.  That's one of my faves.  Yeah, don't forget all the lies, too, when it's all going down.  Sure.  Although they all lie. 
[00:47:00]  But look at Larry Craig.  This fucking, this guy.  Is that the old foot tapper?  Yeah, exactly.  He pleads guilty to almost sucking a cock and then he wants to take it back because  he's embarrassed.  Almost sucking a cock.  Yeah.  I'm guilty.  I almost sucked that cock.  Oh, wait.  No, I didn't.  I was wrong.  Fucking asshole.  Bill in Pennsylvania writes, check out the guy running for mayor of Pittsburgh.  He got busted for DUI and he has tattoos all over his face.  His name is AJ Richardson.  All right.  But is he a Joe candidate or does he like have a legitimate shot? 
[00:47:30]  I think it's AJ Poopy shit.  AJ Poopy shit.  And then we have the other politician.  Wasn't he jerking off as the car was going 90 miles an hour or something?  Yeah.  Best story of the day.  What does that guy do?  No, my coworker does that.  That guy's running for mayor, huh?  Mayor.  Wow.  Goldie Wilson's fucking rebel brother there.  Man.  He's all tatted up. 
[00:48:00]  Mayor.  All right.  Are we ready for a mayor that has tattoos on his face?  This is crazy, mayor guy.  Yeah.  You always get one.  Underdog.  At least one.  Mayor.  No, I wouldn't even call that.  I would call it a Joe candidate.  What's this platform?  I don't know.  I'm moving a hot mic.  Sorry.  I think it's better than sucking snot down my throat on the mic.  So I could hit the call button.  Let me see. 
[00:48:30]  We can ask Dennis today.  Yeah.  What do you do when you have a cold on the air?  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Let's see how he handles it.  Man drove 90 miles an hour with genitals hanging out the window.  How do you do that?  Wait.  He's driving?  How do you do that?  Driving?  How do you hang your cock out the window and drive?  How do you keep your, unless you put it in cruise control, I guess, right?  You have to go cruise control.  You have to.  Why would you do that?  Very good.  And how did you get caught doing that?  Three women testified against former Mount Carmel Vice Mayor William Blakely, graphically 
[00:49:00]  recounting times he exposed himself while driving at Thursday's preliminary hearing in Kingsport.  I was scared that I was going to wreck.  He was going to cause me to wreck, witness Deborah Sturgill said.  You know what?  If a chick had her pussy pressed against the window, not one guy would be calling up and  bitching.  No, not at all.  I was afraid I was going to wreck.  That's the big difference between you ladies and us gentlemen. 
[00:49:30]  You'd be so happy.  Yeah.  You'd just be like, this is great.  You'd tell your friends.  I dream of women just flashing me on a subway.  Are you kidding me?  Fucking spreading their legs.  A guy does it and the women, they're taking pictures, running the police, fucking rats.  They start screaming and panicking.  You would sit there and enjoy it.  When a girl does it, we wouldn't be, oh, I was afraid.  I was stunned.  I was shocked.  I was disgusted.  I swear, even if she was a pig.  Who cares?  She's sitting on the subway with just a skirt, no panties on, and she opens her legs. 
[00:50:00]  You'd be like, this could be the best day I've had in a long time.  But yeah, if it's a guy and a girl, the girl's screaming and yelling.  A woman just pressed against the window, driving, like she's eating algae off the inside of  a fish tank.  I can't get it out.  I'm stuttering.  It seems that every victim would tell the same story, but I knew all the victims did not  know each other, the police are saying.  So that's when they realized they had something.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  Personal accounts and Thursday's testimonies started the same.  Blakely allegedly waving to get the driver's attention, then escalating to honking and partially  crossing over into the driver's lane.  Waving, grabbed his shirt, kind of pulled it up, witness Deanna Dyke said.  So what?  He got off.  He picked the wrong woman.  You forgot the the in between.  Can we have a picture of this guy?  So he got off fucking going on the highway and getting naked and kind of like flashing  his dick to the women, right? 
[00:51:00]  Yep.  So what gives a fuck?  I would laugh at that.  Right.  That seems funny.  Even if it's a guy, I would laugh at that.  I'd be laughing your ass off.  It's hilarious.  Who cares?  I would chase him the way that woman chased Zell.  I would just keep pointing and going.  Zell!  I couldn't think of anything to yell at the man's penis.  So I just yelled the movie line.  So then after the waving.  So the guy's waving to get their attention.  It turned into a lot of beeping.  Him grabbing his chest area and asking me, asking me going, please, please. 
[00:51:30]  Clasping hands together with his hands.  May I show me yours?  Witness Kelly Street said.  Huh?  I don't know.  She fucking doesn't know how to fucking talk.  That's her exact quote.  That doesn't make sense.  Each witness testified they were fearful.  Blakely's driving would cause an accident.  There you go.  He was taking his hand, wetting his mouth, and masturbating.  That just makes me laugh.  What a creep.  At over 90 miles per hour, he had his penis out the window. 
[00:52:00]  He was masturbating.  And that's when it got really, really bad.  I wouldn't look over anymore.  No, you keep looking.  Oh, stop.  When you keep looking.  Just don't look.  It'll go away.  I wouldn't look over anymore.  And I wrote his tag number down on my hand, which I believe he noticed.  And he exited very quickly.  Street said.  Of course.  See how this always works out?  Yeah.  Guy's masturbating, and one of the witnesses' last name is Street.  How fucked up is that? 
[00:52:30]  Happens in so many fucking stories.  Detective, yeah, Dyke.  Detective Terry Christian says it's Street's writing down of the license tag number that  served as a catalyst for William Blakely's charges.  It's amazing how we're almost siding with him.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy's a fucking creep.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  But let him go.  But the point is, if a woman was doing that, we're not fucking writing her tag down or any  of that shit.  Calling the cops. 
[00:53:00]  We're not doing any of that.  If she had her pussy hanging out a window going 90 miles an hour, we're not doing any of this.  That's the only point I'm making.  Look like a fucking bulldog.  Just flapping and drooling.  Hey, I think some of them are shooting the sequel to Turner and Cooch.  Turner and Cooch.  Why are women creeps?  It seems like it's always the guys that are creeps.  What's that about?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, you never hear about women doing creepy things like this.  Very rare.  I think it's extremely rare.  I think it's a thing where you don't hear about it because a lot of guys, like we were  saying, don't report it.  Right.  They don't care.  And girls, I just don't think they find that shit as funny or as sexually, you know, exciting.  Guys are fucking pigs.  All right.  And then here, it went on for so long and nobody's addressed it, Christian said, referring to the  dozens of phone calls the department has received over the course of three or four years. 
[00:54:00]  Guy got away with it for three or four years, she said.  Uh, ages of the alleged victims range from 16 to 65.  This guy didn't give a fuck.  Covers all fucking spectrum.  Maybe that was just a slow day on the highway.  Yeah.  Highway.  And he saw a 65 roll and went, ah, what the fuck?  Was he driving a Grand Prix?  See, there were the ex.  You know what it is?  If a woman did that, like part of it is that you're being naughty and you're being daring.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Like, you know, a woman would get off the exit and there would be a convoy behind her.  People approving and hawking.  Ma'am, could you show your pussy again at the light?  Yeah, she pulls up in her driveway.  Guys are like, come on.  Let's fuck.  Guys are pigs.  Well, it's important to make that report because if you don't, they're going to feel that they  can continue that offense and continue victimizing more females.  Victimized.  And that might be your best friend, your daughter, your mother, your aunt, your niece. 
[00:55:00]  They can just say females and assume we know what that encompasses.  I hate when they list, you know, it's a woman, could be your mother.  I know what my mother's gender is.  Yes, female.  Just say a female and it covers all women.  And you need to make that report because that's what's going to eventually stop that  type of behavior.  Right.  Blakely, facing charges of indecent and reckless endangerment and criminal attempt to commit  aggravated assault.  Mm-hmm.  Well, Godspeed there.  This guy should go to jail.  He's a fucking creep.  Yeah, he is. 
[00:55:30]  He's a creep.  And he's endangering people's lives by going that fast with a stump cock flopping out the  window.  What a dick.  He's absolutely a creep.  It's just funny, though.  Yeah.  I just find that shit just funny.  It's hysterical.  Fucking hanging his pecker out the window.  His pecker.  Yeah, what's that?  What are you using?  It's like one of those things at the airport.  Yeah.  The fucking wind testers at the plane.  Pilots will look at him.  A wind sock.  A wind sock.  Yeah.  Yes, it's his wind sock.  Oh, wait.  No, but it's a wind cock.  Good one.  You know what I said, Sammy? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, there it is.  I wouldn't find it as funny if the guy was following the women and shit.  You know what I mean?  But, nah, what are you going to do?  Wes, the trucker.  He's a regular.  He's got a little story for everybody.  Wes, let's hear your story.  Start singing Convoy.  It's his story.  Guys, yeah.  Years ago, there was a lady that lived in Nashville, and every fucking morning she would ride to  work with her big-ass pit hanging out, touching her snatch. 
[00:56:30]  Everyone knew about it.  The truckers would line up.  The cops had to have known about it because they got a CB radio.  What do you mean, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, man?  How did everyone know about it?  She had the same route, and you guys would just wait around because she knew?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She knew you guys were waiting or whatever, which was probably even more of a turn-on for her?  Yeah, I mean, she would just cruise to work, and, you know, if you happen to be lucky in the area, going down the road, I mean, truckers can just look down, and we can see in the car. 
[00:57:00]  You can see everything.  So, yeah, she would just go to work, about a 30-mile ride, man, with her big old tit hanging out, and, I mean, guys are on the CB radio.  Cops, I mean, they got to know about it.  Cops, cops, they got a CB.  Oh, she would say it on the CB radio.  And, of course, you're a good citizen, so you reported this behavior to the police, right?  Oh, absolutely not.  See, of course not.  Why would you?  I didn't know the answer to this.  No, of course I didn't.  Was she, I don't know, from 1 to 10, what was she, I guess? 
[00:57:30]  Yes, yeah.  Ah, it's more like cougarish, so, I don't know, like a six or six or a cougar.  Cougar.  A cougar.  Oh, boy.  Love the cougars.  But you know what?  When you're on the road and those big things are hanging out, you don't even give a shit.  You don't have to justify it.  Oh, that's what I was saying earlier.  You don't care.  Yep.  Yep.  Guy's trying to justify it to us.  We understand.  Oh, you know what?  This is a very good point.  If he was doing 90, then she's doing 90, so she's speeding and breaking the law, too. 
[00:58:00]  Why wouldn't you just slow down?  She was in hot pursuit.  Or maybe she was going 90 to begin with, and this guy's like, well, fuck, I gotta go 90  miles an hour so I can show my dick.  That's all well and fine, but I'm in a hot speed pursuit.  Gotta show that dick to that fine lady.  Yes.  All right, why don't we break?  So Dan Aykroyd's in at 9 o'clock, promoting vodka.  Yeah.  But God asked him about Caddyshack 2. 
[00:58:30]  Somehow it has to come up.  Yeah, I think he's...  It has to come up.  Are they doing Caddyshack 3?  It should be the first question.  He's gotta answer for that.  He has to.  Why did you think that playing Bill Murray would work?  Well, he thinks he's coming to Vegas to be our right-hand man, and we walk in and we  go, you gotta answer for Caddyshack 2.  I swear to God, who approached you?  Was it Jackie Mason or was it Bill Murray?  Is there officially a worse comedy now?  No.  Caddyshack 2 still has to be number one. 
[00:59:00]  I'd say worse.  Yeah.  Has to be.  Worst ever.  I don't remember.  Is there any Dan Aykroyd for that to be had?  I don't remember.  Oh my God, we've done this bit so many times.  No, I'm not saying it in a bad way.  I'm just saying it's so uncomfortable to watch.  I don't remember.  Oh God, give me something.  Those big, fancy law schools like you didn't make up your point.  So you're going to have to explain.  Oh good, Randy Quaid?  Randy Quaid.  He's always good.  Anything he's in, he stinks in.  He plays this over-the-top lawyer.  You probably want to play the second one down there. 
[00:59:30]  Well, what happened?  It's camcorded at television.  Yeah, I know, but that's him being the Bill Murray character.  So let's see if the quality's good.  Robert Stack.  He thought they could get the airplane vibe from him.  Fucking hilarious.  Good morning, Mrs. Esterhaus.  Mrs. Esterhaus, me, you idiot.  You bought my Rolls Royce. 
[01:00:00]  It's typical.  In my line of work, I'm having some details of giant.  Just make sure that next time we're on the screen.  I can't hear it.  That's fucking hilarious, though.  It's so bad.  The quality's bad.  My mother and I watched that.  He made a voice and did like this, like, oh, I can do it for you.  It was so bad.  Fucking hilarious.  That was his interpretation of Bill Murray, man.  He was making it his own.  He's crazy or not, though.  Oh, God.  Turns into this whole miniature golf thing. 
[01:00:30]  And then they tried to do something where Jackie Mason had, like, golf clubs that did wacky things.  Right.  It was so bad.  It's everything about a bad 80s comedy.  Oh.  What happened to Dangerfield?  Why didn't he do two?  Thank God.  Probably saw the script.  He probably said no to it.  He could have.  None of them were in it.  Why wouldn't they fucking, you know, try to figure it out?  They didn't even put Noonan in it.  He might have been doing Back to School at that point.  Yeah.  He had some fun movies.  They couldn't get anyone, though.  No one. 
[01:01:00]  They recast the entire fucking movie.  They got Chevy Chase.  Or franchise.  He was in it?  To do it.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Chevy Chase was in it.  I swear you, I don't even remember.  Not a lot, but he was in it.  Right.  And everyone else was different.  What do you think he would say about that?  They paid me a lot of money.  No, we tried to have fun with someone recently that was in a shitty movie, and he got all  fucking on his high horse.  Well, it was fucking, um...  And then told us how much money the movie made.  That was Seth Green.  That was a while ago.  Seth Green, yeah.  And I'm like, look, man, all right, so the movie made, you know, a lot of money, but 
[01:01:30]  everyone has said it's a shit movie.  Up Schitt's Creek or whatever the fuck.  Remember?  Yeah.  He was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you should have seen what that made.  It's like, all right.  Yeah, we were having, we were just having a little fun.  Calm down.  There was something.  You know, we were kissing his ass about all the other stuff that did work.  Hmm.  Robot chicken and everything else, and then we went down that road.  He was like, you know how much money that movie made?  Calm down there.  Exactly.  That was the same day, like, he played his commercials from when he was a kid. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  It was just like, let's all have fun because we're friends.  Yeah, we thought we were at that stage with him, but we were wrong.  He's probably the guy who hangs out with people that just say, you're fucking awesome, man.  All day, you know.  Might have something on his shoulder.  Thanks for that, Sam.  I appreciate it.  What do you mean?  I know I'm awesome.  I mean, I was.  What?  What's he got on his shoulder?  Oh, a chip.  Oh, boy.  Fuck yeah.  I'm on your shoulder.  Is it heavy, cocksucker? 
[01:02:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Nice movie.  The Bird People video is doing good.  Is it?  I don't know.  Probably.  It had like 8 million views or something.  8 million.  Nice.  Fuck yeah, day.  Chip Meets the Bird People?  Let me see if it's doing well.  Chip Meets the Bird People?  Had fucking 8 million views.  Yeah, let me check.  8 million.  Piece of garbage.  Let me check my numbers.  Yeah, it's doing all right, man.  Chip Meets the Bird People.  It's doing okay.  It's a movie. 
[01:03:00]  How did it go from 8 million to 11,000?  No.  The YouTube takes it down because they're jealous.  The YouTube?  Yeah, the YouTube, their counters are a little behind.  I got the inside numbers in the video.  It's up to 8 million.  8 million.  It's like a superstar or something.  And now that you mention it on the show, I get to tweet it again.  How great is that?  Why don't we take a break?  By the way, Regular Joe made an appearance on Red Eye last night.  Oh, really?  And was a hit.  Oh, no.  Congratulations.  Really?  At the end of Red Eye, Regular Joe.  I saw a Regular Joe type character on a commercial for... 
[01:03:30]  I've been told I'm a character.  You might be a character, but I know I am.  What the hell do I know?  Have your soup, sick guy.  At least you show up for work.  It was for...  You...  What is a urinary tract infection?  UTI, yeah.  It was for UTI Institute.  UTI.  And this guy's walking around this, like, garage where they're repairing cars and stuff.  Right.  And he won't stop walking. 
[01:04:00]  Like, every shot, he's got to be walking, looking at the camera.  And he's got a rag in his hand with no grease on it, wiping his hands.  And he points at the camera and then cuts to another thing where he's like,  and you could get this job.  And he just looks like the asshole on the job.  Like the guy you don't want to fucking see.  Pop up a UTI commercial.  UTI, uh, yeah.  UTI.  UTI commercial.  All right.  Go down to the... 
[01:04:30]  I guess it's the...  Yeah, that's probably it.  No.  Go down to commercial right there.  No, no.  No.  That one.  Yeah, try that one.  Look at this guy.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Fuck it, I'm sorry.  No.  That one.  Yeah, but I see your point.  No, that's not it either.  Not it, Sam.  God damn it.  I had it yesterday.  You're stupid.  I know guys like you sitting right where you're sitting, thinking exactly what you're thinking.  Bobbing his head as he walks.  Swinging his arms. 
[01:05:00]  And in this tough economy, you've got to think harder and smarter.  Look, there's only one place for guys like you.  Look at him.  Why is he still walking?  I know.  It's like it's the only time he walked, ever.  Why is he walking?  He knows what to do with his hands, though.  Look at him.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, Jesus.  When you're working.  Everyone on the job hates him. 
[01:05:30]  He's still walking.  Oh, my gosh.  Stop walking.  He's serious about being the best in the business.  I hate this guy.  Why is he walking so much?  Let's talk.  Let's talk about UTI programs.  Yeah, what do I know?  I know, Kaz.  Your new career starts your first day at UTI.  Are you ready?  Yeah, I'm ready.  No, he's got to walk away.  Why is he walking everywhere?  Oh, he walks.  That guy loves to walk.  I mean, the open shot where he walks, you know, into frame, fine.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop.  Job site never slows down. 
[01:06:00]  That's what I always say.  It's a race.  Is it for what?  What the hell do I know?  I just want to sit down with my lunch pail, relax, have a sandwich, container of coffee.  You run around on the YouTubes, fancy guy.  What the hell do I know?  Oh, man.  Yeah, that guy annoyed me.  Let's get Dennis Falcone in here after the break.  Yes.  I want to know how you handle doing a shift if you're sick.  And other things on the way.  I don't know if we have R.E.M. fans out there, Iraq. 
[01:06:30]  I'm a fan of the sleep.  Are you?  Are you?  Murmur, 30 years ago today.  I guess that's why we're doing a little R.E.M. for everybody. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  They're indie rock, right?  Is this alternative music?  It's indie.  It's indie.  It was all rock.  30 years ago, it was all rock.  It was college radio.  College radio.  But now it's just called indie, man.  It's a new term.  Indie's a new term.  Yeah?  What do you call it, man?  Indie.  Indie's a new term.  Club said Kenny and me were on Covino and Rich yesterday.  Speaking of indie.  Who was on there? 
[01:07:30]  Me and Kenny.  Well, here's why they were on there.  Because a certain bigger person was invited but couldn't do it.  Oh, bigger.  Wait, you were invited to go on Covino and Rich?  Of course I was!  Now, I happen to be here late waiting for a Big Daddy Kane picture.  Wait, you guys went on Dude Bro Nation?  Yeah.  We tried to explain to them and Covino won't do it.  You gotta explain because we probably have people that weren't listening yesterday.  Well, Club said he can't.  We learned that they have the Dude Bro Nation.  Covino and Rich.  Dude Bro Nation. 
[01:08:00]  Covino and Rich.  What's that, Kenny?  I'm sorry.  You missed a great show yesterday.  I did.  You talking about Covino and Rich?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were going over their Brocabulary.  Yeah, they have a whole Brocabulary list.  Wasn't that a book title at week?  That was brought up yesterday.  We feel like they were ripping off, what was it, Brocabulary was the name of the book, right?  G.H., let's just face facts.  They're two of the coolest guys at SiriusXM.  Swoot!  No, Swoot is bad. 
[01:08:30]  Fuck!  No, it's Swoot!  What am I going to get that right?  Sweet is good.  They say Swoot.  Swoot is the opposite.  Man Cave talk?  Yes, big time.  Yeah.  They talk about Nussies, man.  Nussies?  What's that?  They're Nussinators, I think, or something like that.  What the fuck is that?  It's a new hussy.  It's a Nussie.  That's right.  See, I misunderstood it.  Nussie, man.  What the fuck is that?  What?  They talk about Nussies.  You don't like a Nussie every once in a while.  It's a new hussy.  Like, hey, look at that Nussie.  Yeah, man.  What's wrong with you?  And then you could be a dude bro dad.  Or a bro dad.  Bro dad bro dude. 
[01:09:00]  What?  Dude bro is like what we call each other, like a couple dude bros just hanging out.  But because I'm a father now, I would be a dude dad bro.  Or a bro dad dude.  No, dad bro.  A dude dad.  A dude something.  Dude dad.  What?  Or you're Sal, you're a dude bro.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  But Anthony's into the hokey pokey.  You are.  You're definitely into the hokey pokey.  What's the hokey pokey?  That's what it's all about.  It's when you're hitting a Nussie doggy steez and you jazz on her back.  This isn't real. 
[01:09:30]  It is.  This is not fucking real.  Doggy steez jazz.  Let me just put it this way, because I was thinking about it on the way home yesterday.  We were on our best behavior yesterday.  Yeah.  By not just completely ripping them apart?  We like those guys.  Because we like them.  Look, you could like them, guys.  We were on our best behavior.  It was really tough not to completely destroy them.  That's everything I fucking hate.  It's that man cave.  Hey, bro.  Hey, dude.  No, no, no.  It's not hey.  Let's get down in the man cave.  Hold on.  It's not hey, bro. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, dude.  It's dude bro.  That's what makes it different.  Holy shit.  We could easily go to the mattresses.  Because, you know, they're saying like you guys are like the original OGs, almost like  ready to go out to pasture, and they're the two coolest guys on radio.  They've been at it for seven years.  When are they going to hit?  We hit in less than a year.  What are they talking about?  Hold on a second.  If they really want to start this, I'll fucking go.  We did start it.  We started it.  What the fuck are they talking about? 
[01:10:30]  Why don't you just listen to this thing?  They're seven years in.  I don't think they actually said that.  No, they probably didn't.  Do they speak any words in English, or is it all in that bro talk?  They replaced it.  They love play on words.  Then Rich came in here, and he threw Covino under the bus and basically said, oh, God,  that stuff, I haven't paid attention to that in years.  And I'm like, it's on your website, though, dude, bro.  Covino explained that it wasn't like a...  Show Anthony the t-shirts.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  You can get a t-shirt, dude, bro.  Oh, no.  I'm thinking of getting a Swoot shirt. 
[01:11:00]  Swoot with an exclamation point.  You don't know what it means.  Swoot!  You know what this shit reminds me of every time I see it?  You ever see the Penn & Teller bullshit about that direct marketing?  It was...  And they have a guy that's trying to sell these man cave type products.  I'm like, hey, and he's got like a...  He has a bunch of people over, like an Amway meeting, and he's got a bunch of people over  and he's cooking up steaks, and they're all wearing like man cave type shirts, and hey, 
[01:11:30]  let me get that beer for you.  And it's this fake man thing.  But we lose, because a lot of our listeners have man caves.  Look, you can have what you want to call your room, your place, your fucking hangout.  When you call something a man cave, and you go there because that's the only place the  wife lets you fucking be a man, it's not a man cave.  I want a man cave.  Fuck.  I think you're half a quay if you've got a man cave, personally.  Yes, you're a quay.  Because you're going way out of your way to make sure no women around.  That's weird.  Yeah, first of all.  I get you wanting to maybe go downstairs and, you know, watch the big game. 
[01:12:00]  Sorry, occasionally when I'm sipping a beer and watching something, to see a nice ass  walk by is kind of quaint.  Yeah, but imagine when you were married.  Like, your wife is cool.  Imagine when you were married, how awful she was.  And I just want to hang out with your friends and play video games.  Whatever you want to do.  You know.  Yeah, but you don't have to call it a man cave.  I'm not saying I like the man cave.  That's the problem.  Here's the biggest problem.  I would feel like I was sequestered somewhere because my fuck wife wouldn't let me just 
[01:12:30]  do this anywhere in my own fucking house.  She should go up to her fucking room and shut the goddamn door and let me have my man house.  Fuck man cave.  It's my man house.  Get out.  My man house.  Oh, my God.  You're not getting a man cave.  Look at me.  I put up some beer signs here.  Hey, look what I got here.  We got the TV.  We got some sports memorabilia up on the walls.  Hey.  Hey, Bobby, come on in.  Sit down.  We're going to be in the man cave tonight. 
[01:13:00]  What are you doing down there?  Did you take out the garbage?  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back to the man cave after I satisfy this monster upstairs.  Guys, I'll be back to the man cave.  You need to take care of something upstairs.  They're the worst hen pet fuckers that are using that man cave to try to grasp onto their  last bit of manhood.  Like they're just doing some stuff with the boys, but then it's right back to fucking suburban  douchey-wise.  Right back to the old ball and chain.  I got a honey-do list for the weekend. 
[01:13:30]  Honey-do this, honey-do that.  Get it?  Oh, God.  Yeah, well, me and my friend, we sit in the man cave watching ball game.  And the wives, ah, boy, do this, do that.  Ah, what the heck?  Woman's work is never done, and neither is mine.  What the heck?  God, take out the trash.  Joe, do this.  Joe, do that.  That's what my name is sometimes.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm Joe, do this.  I start to say to people, Joe, do this.  Joe, do that.  Give me a container of coffee.  You're going to lose, though.  A lot of the guys out there have the man caves.  It's a phony.  They have the man caves.  It's a fucking, uh, it's a phoniness. 
[01:14:00]  Show him all the t-shirts.  He's having a lot of trouble loading.  Sweet!  Yeah.  Oh.  No, sweet's mine.  Oh, sorry.  Sweet is bad.  See, and you can get a t-shirt.  It's hot-ness.  Wait, wait, wait.  Instead of hotness, it's hot-ness.  So that's a hot new hussy?  See, there's the dude brochure.  Who calls a chick a hussy?  You want a chick, for the love of God.  Nobody.  You call it a nussy.  Look, you want the dude bro shirt.  Nussy hunter.  Unfortunately, I have to get the dad bro shirt myself. 
[01:14:30]  What's the Uncle Sam one?  I like that one.  The pussification of America?  I like that one.  Carlin doesn't get all the credit for that expression, because I believe it is his word,  pussification.  You can have a I love nussy shirt.  You look good in an I love nussy shirt.  What about the super handsome dude bro crew?  Yep.  You want one of those?  The fuck would wear these?  They sell them.  Is that all of them?  Swoot.  Swoot.  Well, then why don't we be a good show and buy all these and wear them one day?  We each wear one.  Is that all of them?  Well, you got the nussy hunter. 
[01:15:00]  What is under shenanigans?  Shenanigans, then what does it say?  Tickle sack.  No, under the shenanigans.  Oh, that's where I want to be.  Oh.  It's probably like an office space thing.  And then Yankees.  No, that would be...  With the Yankees logo, look at the Yankees.  Yankees.  Nuts.  D's what?  Nuts.  Uh, what's with the gangstine thing?  Oh, gang.  I don't know.  We were trying to figure that out yesterday.  Covino is Mexican, part Mexican, and he just, uh... 
[01:15:30]  Oh, okay.  So it's Vatos Locos.  So what happened yesterday?  You guys went on the show to discuss what happened on our show yesterday?  Yeah, and to discuss Rich completely throwing Covino under the bus.  Which he did, by the way.  He came on the show, and in order to please the room and not take credit for any of the shitty expressions, he was like, oh yeah, Covino writes all the corny ones.  Those are all, yeah, those are Covino's terms.  I don't know.  But Covino said that because he's... they're not like hacky and douchey radio, because he uses the terms in real life, too. 
[01:16:00]  That's not really a good excuse.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And then Kenny, it was so funny, because they were trying to do, like, a real show, and they're not used to dealing with Kenny's brand of radio.  Uh-huh.  What is Kenny's brand of radio?  Well, he gets on the phone and just tramples over any conversation...  Yes, nice.  ...with statements that have nothing to do with what we're talking about.  Nice.  Kenny starred the whole thing yesterday.  Yeah, I have an agenda.  He just... 
[01:16:30]  Rich will ask me a question.  That's being the operative word.  Rich will ask me a question, and just as I get, like, the second word out, Kenny just pipes in,  Hey! Hey! Rich! Rich! You remember the other day when...  He just...  Ah, just...  Well, Kenny's a big fan of the show.  I mean, Covino and Rich, like, try to say, Oh, yeah, Kenny, good one, buddy!  And I'm just sitting there going, nobody's acknowledging that Kenny's ruining the show on purpose.  Kenny, you're a dad, bro, right? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, Kenny's a dad, bro, as well.  No, I think we decided, since my children are grown, I'm back to being a dude, bro.  Like, GH has, like, little kids, so...  Yeah, I have to be a dad, bro, for a while.  Should all be dead, bro.  That's terrible.  Douche, bro.  Douche, bro, yes.  Dick, bro.  You know who I found out is a big fan of this program?  Home, bro.  Who, Kenny, who?  On Facebook.  Nobody in power, I can tell you that much.  Eliminate everybody with influence in show business. 
[01:17:30]  The law enforcement community on Facebook, there's a page called Law Enforcement WTF Moments.  Oh, well.  And they posted, like, who's a fan of Open Anthem?  They don't include those fucking toll plaza people, do they?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Well, they know that we support the cops pretty soon.  Always.  Someone has to.  Yeah.  Anyway.  It's a po-po.  So it went well?  Yeah, but Kavino won't do the after show. 
[01:18:00]  Why?  He says he's uncomfortable doing other shows because he is afraid that his humor, other  audiences, maybe they won't get it or it'll come off like a douche or whatever.  But that's the thing is, you should do other audiences because that's how you open your show  up to other people.  You can't hope they just luck up on you and love you.  It's okay to go on another show and if you do well, you do well.  I went on their show.  Yeah.  I got 10 new Twitter followers out of it.  Righteous.  Which was nice.  I've been on every fucking show on the platform. 
[01:18:30]  It's done nothing.  Yeah.  It doesn't really do anything.  Yeah.  That was sort of the point I was making by saying 10 Twitter followers.  Yeah.  What's Swoot, by the way?  I've never been on.  I told you what Swoot is.  It's the opposite of Sweet.  Yeah.  I don't get Swoot.  Swoot.  Why is it called Swoot?  What's the origin?  Probably they said it once and they were like, that's funny.  We should say that again.  Yeah.  I think you guys are bastardizing this.  Do you have any audio?  I'm sure there's audio of fucking Kavino Rich.  Well, we were trying to find that they like to do Chinese bits. 
[01:19:00]  We couldn't find a Chinese bit yesterday.  We just listened to the audio yesterday because Kenny ushered him right into one.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  Any time, like, as they're talking and you go, Jim, no, seriously.  So any word that ends with Lee becomes a Chinese guy.  Seriously.  And they do the accent.  They bang the gong.  They put on the music.  But yesterday they were trying to get somewhere and he was like, seriously, though, I was  thinking.  And then Kenny starts yelling over the phone. 
[01:19:30]  You said it.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Oh, no.  And then they broke into a Chinese person.  That's great.  Just derailed the whole train of thought and made them do their Chinese accent.  Kenny started this whole thing yesterday.  Who was the other show?  I forgot already.  Wake Up With Taylor.  What was the other show?  Oh, yeah.  They do their own vocabulary thing.  Tokyo.  Yeah.  Because they're fast, female, and forceful.  That's right.  That's their slug line.  And then if they get into a topic that's a little too edgy, someone in the room might yell 
[01:20:00]  Tokyo.  That's their safe word.  What?  Yeah.  Like, why?  If you're talking sexually and you don't want to go there.  Because they're a little uncomfortable.  So you've got to make it known.  But you can't just say I'm a little uncomfortable.  Tokyo.  Tokyo.  I'm stunned this is happening in this building.  You missed a wonderful hour yesterday.  What the fuck?  Tokyo.  Yeah, man.  I like that.  I want to hear a little Kavino, Rich.  We have no audio of them at all.  How does anybody hear them?  I mean, of course.  I've been on the show, but I've never actually heard it. 
[01:20:30]  I like those guys.  I think Kavino is wrong not to come on another show, though.  That's silly.  Of course.  It doesn't make any sense.  Yeah, you can build the audience.  Yeah, why wouldn't you want to promote a cross-promoting?  Cross-promoting.  That don't make no sense.  Comfortable in their spot.  Nothing?  I don't know.  There's a couple of guests.  Pablo Francisco.  Oh, boy.  On the Kavino and Rich show.  Oh, that could be good.  Yeah, we like Pablo.  They talked to Arnold. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, did Nicole shower?  You're supposed to smell her underarms today.  She probably showered.  What happened?  Was that supposed to happen today?  Yeah.  Yeah, you want me to ask her?  Was she stinky?  No, she was supposed to, like...  Get a little stinky?  For Jimmy, yeah.  She forgot.  You think she forgot?  Of course.  Although, there was a little...  I've heard there was a little bit of tension on the mash-up yesterday with the amount of attention  that some members were getting on this show.  Ah.  And others were not. 
[01:21:30]  Were the other two mad?  Well, Rich missed a break.  Because he was doing all of you and Anthony.  Oh, shit.  I'm so curious.  But yeah, there was some tension with the other...  The members who weren't part of the Opie and Anthony show yesterday feeling like the members  that were, were not taking the mash-up seriously.  Oh.  Perish the thought.  Hey, look.  At least we invite those guys on.  We've never been invited on the mash-up.  Exactly.  How come the mash-up has never said, Jim, you want to come on and promote a gig? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're huge.  Exactly.  Just don't curse because it's family-friendly.  I understand that.  They're in a shitload of places, man.  They don't ever say to me, hey, Jim, why don't you come on?  Are we happy to be walking past the window during the ten seconds they're actually broadcasting  live?  They're in a shitload of fucking stores.  Not because of their banter, obviously, but because they play the latest pop music.  Because of the hits?  Why is that obvious?  It's very obvious.  I don't understand why you need five people to play the hits.  There's four of them.  I could do a celebrity break.  Yeah.  Went to a Lindsay Lohan over there.  Who was mad? 
[01:22:30]  Probably the weatherman.  Maybe the guy who, when Rich came back in after missing a break, said, oh, yeah, it  was funny.  It was funny.  And, Ryan, they were doing the thing where, you know, they don't remember who you are.  It was really funny.  But I don't really know him.  But the person...  Now I make believe I know him.  I know that much.  The person who that's about probably doesn't think it's as funny.  Well, he's forgettable.  Well, that's up to him.  I know.  It's up to people to make a... 
[01:23:00]  People need to go out of their way to make an impression.  If you know people around here think you're forgettable, then you've got to kind of like,  you know, pump it up a little bit.  Maybe wear like a shirt with polka dots one day.  Maybe add traffic to your break.  Do weather and traffic.  Because on a national radio show, weather and traffic and stuff like that...  That's his job?  Oh, boy.  His job's to do weather for the country?  He does national...  Yeah, he does weather on a national...  What?  Why would you do that?  I swear you.  I don't pay attention to any weather breaks, no matter where they are.  Whether it's on the radio, on the TV. 
[01:23:30]  If I want to know the weather, I pop up my stupid fucking zip code.  Watch this.  All right.  54 degrees right now.  A high of 57.  A low of 45 here in New York City.  That's all I need to know.  Partly cloudy.  Right.  There.  There's my weather.  You pop your zip code in.  Would you ever have anybody...  I hate the USA Today.  Why?  If I just fucking...  No weekend edition.  I do, too.  Dicks.  All those immigrants.  Oh.  Hmm.  No, the USA Today, though, has the weather in the whole continental United States. 
[01:24:00]  That's great.  Yes, I have it all in my phone, too.  I could check the weather anywhere.  It's great.  A giant color forms, fucking half a page hunk of shit map.  That dog shit paper.  Wait, Kenny, does this mean you're going to give us a national weather forecast?  Pick a city, any city.  Why don't you just do all of them?  They do all of them?  Yeah.  No.  It's in alphabetical order.  Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver.  He's going to do this all day. 
[01:24:30]  Detroit, Honolulu, Houston.  Is it cold in the day?  Indianapolis, Kansas City.  You're not doing any temperatures.  How long does it take him to do the weather, this guy?  Well, he actually...  He doesn't do, like, as detailed as all that.  He just goes, like, you know, in the South, it's raining.  Yeah, he talks by region.  By region.  Who does that fucking help?  Nobody.  What is going on?  I want to hear some Covino and Ridge.  What do I hear Covino and Ridge?  What do you want to hear?  I mean, there's stuff on YouTube.  I don't know.  I want to hear an Asian bit.  Yeah.  We tried that. 
[01:25:00]  Did we get it yesterday?  No.  You would think by now we'd have an Asian bit.  Why couldn't we find one?  I thought you had access to it.  All their stuff is not organized like ours is.  We couldn't just ask them.  I think it was bits and bumpers, not the conversations that Kenny was talking about.  I don't mean just you, but we have a few people on the work for the show.  I know you've tried.  By the way, they do have a loyal following, so let's be careful.  Yeah, they do the Dude Bro convention every year.  Oh, no, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  They go to, like, a women's basketball game or something once a year. 
[01:25:30]  What?  Yeah, I think so.  How about the Schwarzenegger interview?  It was on the phone, I'm sure, right?  No, it was, uh...  They got Schwarzenegger?  Yeah, it was...  It looks like...  What the fuck?  When, by the way?  For this last movie that he was in?  We're not doing a...  Oh, it was at the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus.  Not right.  So they went to his thing.  No, I want a regular break where they're just yapping.  Arnold, not all that hard to get anymore when he's trying to push a fucking shitty movie. 
[01:26:00]  Boy, that last movie was fucking bomb.  Paul Marooney.  Because nobody wants to see him being in action, so no one gives a fuck anymore.  You're 60.  You're the governor.  No.  The governator.  Yeah.  They don't have any regular breaks on YouTube.  There's not one Kavito and Rich Bits?  I mean, on YouTube, they have their interviews.  They don't believe in YouTube yet?  They're not good at...  They're comfortable where they are.  They're not good at branding themselves at all.  But, I mean, like, you know.  Oh, boy.  They're comfortable where they are. 
[01:26:30]  They got their audience, and that's it, you know?  That's why...  All right, dude, bro.  You just sit there.  Yeah, calm down, dude, bro.  I mean, the things I was just saying I would think would offend them.  I don't think I was defending.  I thought we were going to get Dennis Falcone for this break.  Oh, yeah.  You want me to go grab him right now?  Yeah, what do we do?  I'm hitting the cough button now like crazy.  Yeah, we need Dennis Falcone.  Dan Aykroyd coming in today at 9.30 to promote some vodka.  Yes.  Yes.  And also, Drea Di Matteo. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  From The Sopranos fame.  Uh-huh.  He's done a bunch of things since then.  Yeah.  She was fucking...  I was watching The Sopranos.  She's looking really amazing in that.  Jesus Christ, did she...  Braun panties?  Braun panties.  Goddamn.  All the time.  Oh, Dennis Falcone likes to take his fucking time walking down the hall, huh?  Yeah, he should be a fucking toll plaza worker.  Holy shit.  Oh, there he goes.  Whoa.  He doesn't really know how to walk fast. 
[01:27:30]  He's like almost a midget.  Yeah, he's just...  He's a little weird looking.  He's a little strange.  Dumb head.  Dennis Falcone, how are you, sir?  How are you, gentlemen?  How are you feeling, Anthony?  Well, you know...  That's why we have you in here.  You don't sound bad.  It's a little under the water.  You really don't sound bad.  Content-wise, though.  No, no, no, no.  No, well, you know, when you're sick, you kind of get a little more deep, deeper voice.  I would have stayed home, personally, if I were you.  Because, you know what? 
[01:28:00]  Sadly, even though they're your best friends, you're spreading germs in the studio.  Yeah, I figured I was over that...  Is he still...  Is he really spreading germs?  Sure.  He's not contagious anymore, is he?  Dennis is not a doctor.  He's a radio guy.  Yeah, you're really asking Dennis, like, he's the authority on germs.  Are you the radio doctor?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure someone had that title.  Maybe you could ask Dan Aykroyd.  He was Dr. Detroit, wasn't he?  Yeah, one of the worst movies ever made.  Why would you bring that up?  Well, you brought up Caddyshack 2 before.  Yeah, but that's like... 
[01:28:30]  It was so bad, it was good.  Would you talk about Dr. Detroit and then maybe go into a Motown song?  Good.  I like that.  I like that.  Very good.  I like that.  I like that.  Good.  He thought about it for a second.  What do you think of a radio show that comes up with their own terminology?  That's great.  Their own vocabulary.  That's good.  You're branding it.  It's good.  Yeah.  Do you have any examples from the past?  Guys that used to come up with their own words that kind of stuck, kind of hit?  Yeah, there's a...  Wow.  Top of my head, I can't think of it, but I'm sure there's guys that had things like, 
[01:29:00]  you know, they had their own way to say things, right?  Didn't Wolfman Jack always say things differently?  Imus.  What would he say?  Like, I'm a wolf or something?  Yeah, what did Imus do?  Imus.  How's your Donkey Kong?  Oh, you're naked, baby.  He used to do things like that.  You know, but how's your Donkey Kong?  What year is this?  I think Robert W. Morgan out in California used to call it a fracas Friday.  Fracas Friday.  Why?  I have no idea what it meant.  Why?  But he just did.  It just made sense, right?  It just made sense for him, I guess. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, fracas Friday.  Now, is that your own windscreen on the microphone?  No, I think this is a public...  Everybody should have their own.  I agree.  Everybody should have their own.  Yeah.  You come in, you put your own windscreen on the microphone.  Have your own windscreen.  That'd be nice.  Maybe Mars can arrange those in a little egg carton and spray them down every day.  Get some windscreen.  Replace them.  You should have some Lysol.  Spray some Lysol on the...  A little Lysol.  Yeah, a little alcohol.  But more so...  I don't believe in the windscreen thing.  He's putting germs into the windscreen, then the next disc jockey's going to sit there and... 
[01:30:00]  Disc jockey.  The next what?  Following your logic.  The next disc jockey that uses my windscreen would talk a lot more.  Right.  And he's going to get sick.  You don't have to worry about germs from the disc jockey that uses your mind.  It's not contagious.  No, but the thing is, if you're listening to a radio station and the disc jockey doesn't sound good,  it makes the station sound like you.  Why couldn't they let that person stay home?  No.  I've never thought that in my entire life.  That sounded weak.  I've heard many a DJ sound like shit on the air because they were a little sick, 
[01:30:30]  and I never thought, well, how dare they make him work today?  I think they should stay home because they're getting their fellow workers.  Oh, do you?  Now, how many sick days do you get?  Because I know we get maybe five.  All right, but he's sick.  He's legitimately sick.  We get five for the whole year.  He's not on a cruise.  So you can't stay home is the point.  Cruising for a bruising.  Most companies, you can't stay home anymore because they don't give you sick days.  So they force their fucking employees to come in and get everyone else sick.  I'm sure if he went to management and called up, said, look, bring a note from the doctor. 
[01:31:00]  Remember you had to bring a note from the doctor?  Well, I do remember that.  Not Dennis.  No, no.  Look, we could get past this whole spreading germ thing.  Here's the deal.  Yes.  You're in.  You've got to come in, so you come in.  But what do you do if you're feeling a little under the weather, your voice may be not up to par,  you're coughing, sneezing, clearing the throat, a lot of that.  How do you handle that during your air shift or your show? 
[01:31:30]  It's not a shift, Opie.  You keep the brakes short.  Keep the brakes short.  Meat and potatoes.  Don't try to, you know, don't try to push it.  Don't try to read two liners during the break.  Just do the one.  And really, in a break, you know, it's funny because in a break it should be one thought per break.  Don't do the five-day forecast when you're doing the weather.  What are you talking about?  You guys just say nothing in between the records.  One thought per break.  If you're going to deliver the station positioning liner, the intro, and the time, that's it. 
[01:32:00]  Don't go off and do that.  The time, the weather.  Don't forget, I'm going to be down at the so-and-so car.  But if you work for an oldie station, what is going off?  Yeah.  Going off?  That's my point, yeah.  Well, in the morning show, you'll probably be going off.  In the midday, the afternoon show, not as much.  But in the morning show, you know, where you have two hosts, you're talking about, you know, current events and things in the news.  Hey, how about the Mets lost.  The Yankees rained out last night.  Mets and Yanks rained out.  Yeah, now.  Were they really?  Yeah.  I didn't know. 
[01:32:30]  The Mets played.  I wish they were rained out.  Mets played.  They lost.  Yankees rained out.  Yeah.  They had two losses now in Philly.  I went to my first Islanders game in a year.  Nice.  Did they win?  What a shithole.  I forgot.  Is this going off?  I almost forgot.  Yeah, we're going off a little bit.  Oh.  I almost forgot how much of a shithole the Nassau Coliseum was.  Well, you called it.  They're talking about saying, fuck waiting.  Oh, they are?  Yep.  Yeah.  I wouldn't wait.  They're ready to go.  I would take the penalty to do whatever the fuck.  I don't know.  I was realizing the Jumbotron.  The screen is so tiny. 
[01:33:00]  I never realized how tiny that thing was.  Most people have those in their houses now.  Right.  The building's 40 years old, right?  70, 72, 73.  I know, but they fucking didn't update anything, but the ticket prices continue to go up, and  the parking fees continue to go up, but they didn't fucking put any money back into that  shithole.  No, we don't pay enough taxes on Long Island.  Holy fuck.  Oh, boy, I think he's being sarcastic.  Oh, you do, definitely.  It's a shame.  It's sad that the Islanders are leaving the game.  And they got rid of Debbie. 
[01:33:30]  Now I'm going way too inside.  Debbie knew a little bit about hockey.  She would talk to the coach and the players in between periods really fast.  Uh-huh.  What was her name?  Debbie something?  Debbie Cakes.  Oh, yeah, I know what you mean.  All right.  Well, now they got the...  Does Dallas?  Now they got the blonde bimbo that's looking a little long in the tooth.  Now they got her, Dina, they got her fucking interviewing the players in between periods.  But she's working, the other girl is working with Stan Fishler, I think, on the double broadcast  or the shoe broadcast.  Oh, she moved over there? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  So the Islanders organization decided not to replace her and to get the bimbo to talk to  the players now to save some money.  Maybe she wanted more money.  Bimbo.  Bimbo, is that a word?  I say himbo.  She does that.  I say himbo.  Himbo?  I think bimbo.  She wanted more money.  She's lucky to fucking make minimum wage.  She stinks.  Anyone that's a fan of that team knows how bad she is.  And they had her on the screen at first because she was sort of hot back in the day.  She's not even close to sort of hot anymore. 
[01:34:30]  You remember the ice girls that they used to have?  They used to have the ice girls, too.  Remember Jill Nicolini?  She was an ice girl.  Was she?  Yeah.  How was that?  I don't know who she is.  I don't think Jill Nicolini officially was an ice girl.  No, she was in the stands.  She was in the stands.  That's who I'm talking about.  You don't go to games.  When Jill Nicolini left, they brought in Dina.  Jill Nicolini was really good at her job and looked unbelievable.  When she walked through the stands, all the women got pissed off because their guys were  looking at her ass and her tits and stuff.  So she moved on because she had such a great personality. 
[01:35:00]  And they moved Dina in.  I thought you knew all this shit.  And Dina was horrible compared to Jill Nicolini.  Now, fast forward a bunch of years, she's not even almost hot anymore.  And she's interviewing players.  That's how cheap the fucking organization has gotten.  The organization.  The organization, if we're speaking hockey.  Is that really how you say that?  The organization.  I don't know.  Well, but the reason is they're still leaving.  They're going to play a game in Brooklyn next year.  Are they dragging Dina with the team?  I don't know.  Maybe they'll have people who live in Brooklyn.  She'll bring Jill back.  They'll hire her from Brooklyn. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, why not?  No, what is she doing now?  Remember, Klingon was a fan of the Mudhens.  Toledo Mudhens.  She's over at Fox.  Local Fox.  Oh, she's not on PIX anymore?  No.  No, she moved on.  I was supposed to do their morning...  Fox or PIX?  PIX, their weather thing this week or whatever.  Hey, you can watch Lionel.  Oh, Lionel's still over there.  But they haven't gotten back to it.  I don't get it.  You're going to be a guest weatherman?  I like Lionel.  No, I don't understand it.  He was always nice to me, so I like him.  Well, he could be the nicest guy in the world. 
[01:36:00]  Why he chimes in on every news story.  I don't like every person that's nice to me.  It's like, here's what you got to know or something.  No, he was nice.  And they'll be like, and a very important gun control vote coming up later today.  And now, Lionel, with what you need to know about this story.  Well, I'm going to say, it looks like he hadn't shaved in a couple of days.  Give me a Lionel bit.  Yeah, where's Lionel?  Very good.  Lionel, W-P-I-X.  Lionel, why isn't he telling the truth?  Oh, boy.  Anyway, they do still have the Ice Girls, by the way. 
[01:36:30]  I haven't been to a game.  And they were the ones that started that whole phenomenon in hockey.  I believe the Islanders were the first to have the Ice Girls instead of the guys with  the beer bellies with their sneakers on trying to clean up the ice in between periods and  in between stoppages.  They should do YMCA.  Yeah, that was fun.  The Yankees.  That was fun.  Which one do you want to do?  Is this his latest one?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, give us a choice.  All right.  The latest is, of course, the anti-government label.  Okay.  Joe Bai on creating a new world order. 
[01:37:00]  Okay.  The seeming irrationality of another's belief.  Uh-huh.  I don't know what that is.  Something about...  All right, just do the latest one.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You can't even come up with catchy titles for us.  Vignettes.  He's a piece of garbage.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  I hate this.  It's got a jingle.  I like that.  It's horrible.  Let me see, Sam.  I can't see.  Not a fan of Lionel.  Joshua and Sharon Hagen had their parental rights terminated by a Louisiana court. 
[01:37:30]  His head is between his eyeballs and the top of his head.  Look.  He looks like a cartoon.  The court placed them in the permanent custody of the female grandmother who resides in Florida.  Pause.  It's alleged that Joshua, the father of the...  The comic that Jay Moore loved.  It's a wild, wild, wild, wild, wild world.  Vince Chandler.  Buddy Hackett.  He's got a little slim.  He's a slim Buddy Hackett.  Buddy Hackett used to go cross-eyed.  Remember the little bit of luck guys for the lottery?  No! 
[01:38:00]  A little bit of luck guy with the big head and the little body?  No, he just...  His head is giant.  Like, between his eyeballs and the top of his head is so much bigger than...  But his eyes are too close together, too.  Yeah.  And he's wearing those big round glasses.  Give him the illusion that he's cross-eyed.  And the bottom of his face is small.  Like, his jaw and everything.  But it's...  Tom Fitzpatrick, he's just a weird-looking guy.  Does he have a good broadcasting voice there, Dennis Falcone?  Oh, God.  It's unique.  It's unique.  I mean, he's a character.  He's a personality. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, but he's not doing, like, goofy stuff.  He's commenting on the news stories.  Like, they'll interrupt the news.  What?  And with all the big stories.  And he does a little rant about it.  Why does his song sound like that?  I hate...  Lionel, Lionel, Lionel.  I fucking hate it.  If I have Channel 11 on or something when I go to sleep,  and then I'll wake up to that,  like, that'll be, like, annoying me.  I wake up and I start screaming,  I can't find the remote.  Lionel, Lionel, Lionel.  Lionel, Lionel, Lionel, Lionel. 
[01:39:00]  It's a good song.  Yeah.  And it works.  It's catchy because you're singing it.  You're humming it.  It's in your head.  Yeah, right.  Some of the little themes they played at Nuremberg  doesn't mean they're fucking, you know, good.  Dennis makes a good point.  They played themes at Nuremberg?  Yeah, marches and whatnot.  They were catchy, too, Dennis.  It's a jingle.  Let's hear that.  It's a Lionel jingle.  He's good.  He took his children from their grandmother  and stole her car  and took off in a sailboat to Cuba.  Now, this in no way is a justification or defense 
[01:39:30]  for what he did.  That's right.  Not my point.  But here's what you need to know.  Who cares?  Here's what you need to know.  It was reported in every single media news,  newspaper, blog, TV report, you name it,  that the Hakers were, quote, anti-government.  That they attended anti-government rallies.  That's right.  Whatever that means.  The Daily News even added gun enthusiasts  to anti-government.  Who?  Who?  This guy's good.  He should be doing cartoons.  He's got a funny voice.  I can't even listen to it.  It's horrible.  Who, by the way, over at WPIX News, 
[01:40:00]  the wonderful news organization over there,  decided this was a good thing to do.  He was hot for a moment.  Wasn't he on ABC or something?  He did a national radio show.  Yeah, he had something going on, I guess,  for a little while there,  and then all that dried up.  It's so intrusive.  He needs to shut the fuck up.  Right.  Really?  How come you don't have more water in front of you  or some...  I have some water.  Keep pumping the herbal tea.  Herbal tea is good for you, too.  Herbal tea?  Herbal.  Just keep pumping the herbal tea. 
[01:40:30]  What if I get...  Is this bad to do on mic?  Yes, it is.  That's a funny sound.  Hold on.  Is it a funny sound?  I got something for real.  Yeah?  I just realized, I almost forgot,  and we've got to do this before Dan Aykroyd comes in,  and I think Dennis could help us.  Louis C.K., Oh, My God,  premieres Saturday, April 13th,  this Saturday, of course, at 10 p.m. on HBO.  We have $500 to give away.  Wow.  From the people,  the fine people from HBO.  It's quite a prize, isn't it, Dennis?  It's a great prize, yeah, $500. 
[01:41:00]  It's up to you, Dennis.  How are we going to give this away?  How about when the cash cow moves?  It's time to call in.  You like the cash cow?  When the cash cow moves.  Well, how about just when he talks in the next booth?  You talking about Nango, Dennis?  Do you want to do the song of the day?  What's the song of the day?  I don't know.  You have to come up with a song  and say be listening tomorrow  when we play the song of the day.  We'll announce the song at 9.20,  and then sometime later on.  We should go old school.  That's hilarious.  We're going to play music.  Old school. 
[01:41:30]  Wait a minute.  What other ideas you got?  The cash cow moves?  The cash cow moves.  The cash cow moves.  When Anthony grunts?  Well, we could do cash cow moves  with, of course, E-Rog.  Of course we can.  That's kind of funny also.  That's a good one.  And let's see.  How many famous Louys could you come up with?  He is just a pevy of radio contests.  You're going to have people call up  and sing Brother Louie by the stories?  Louie, Louie.  Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.  Yeah, very good. 
[01:42:00]  1973.  You know, Louie C.K. found the guy  to redo that for him?  Did he really?  Yep.  Cool.  The actual guy does it.  Nice.  For Louie Shuff.  How come he didn't get Louie, Louie  by the Kingsman?  Probably too much money.  Louie, Louie.  I don't think he wanted that vibe  for the show either.  The Animal House version by Belushi.  You know when Belushi sang it too?  Hey, how are we going to give this away?  How do you guys want to do this?  We got $500.  I like when the cash cow moves.  I do like that.  But we need to get a move sound to play. 
[01:42:30]  Let's try out E-Rock.  Do you have a good move  before we make this official?  How about creative move?  And if he moves now,  it doesn't mean you call.  Right.  It's going to be sometime later today  or tomorrow.  You know, sometime tomorrow,  you know, between 8 and 9 Eastern.  No, we're not going to fucking do that.  You have to give a time.  It's just when he does it.  No, you have to give a time.  No, we don't have to give a time.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  People can't be sitting there  and listening to the radio for four hours.  You have to have time.  You always got me like,  why are you telling me?  You don't have to give a time.  20.  No.  We'll announce the song of the day. 
[01:43:00]  You want them to linger, linger.  Right.  Linger, longer.  Okay.  You want to build up those quarter hours,  Dennis Falco.  You know that.  So you have to play the sound.  So here's what you have to listen for.  Don't call now.  Here's what you have to listen for.  E-Rock, you got a good move for the people?  No, you got a move.  Oh, my God.  You want him to move.  Even Dennis understands that.  No, we can do it on just a sound effects album in there.  It's a cash cow move.  Starring.  We'll give you a starring role.  Starring E-Rock.  E-Rock's a cow.  He's got a lot of money. 
[01:43:30]  Have you done the moo?  He's got to do a moo.  Yeah, E-Rock, let me hear your moo.  Moo.  No, come on.  Come on.  That would be funny, though.  That's so lackluster.  That could go right by somebody.  E-Rock's a cow.  Mooing, mooing.  E-Rock's a cow.  Well, did he get so bad?  Because I can't think of any other famous cows in the movie mooing.  No.  Elfie.  E-Rock, give it a...  Give it your all.  How would you moo?  Moo. 
[01:44:00]  No, it's got to be a real countable.  Come on.  You've got to bring it out from the belly.  Moo.  No, we don't want...  No, it's got to be like...  No, it's got to be like...  Travis thinks that E-Rock should have to moo.  You should also have a Vix inhaler.  Do you have a Vix inhaler?  Why don't you just keep interrupting people?  No, I don't have a Vix inhaler.  He's not mooing in there, though.  I do have some nasal spray.  Sam? 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  Travis thinks that E-Rock should have to moo and say,  I'm the...  I'm the...  Why is this happening?  Because Dennis is unprofessional and easily distractible.  No, but that's what I love about Dennis.  We have fucked him over already.  We're a horrendous influence on him.  Terrible.  Travis thinks that he should also have to say...  He would have never...  Hold on, sorry.  He would have never interrupted you two weeks ago.  I know.  He's not.  And now he's moving a hot mic and walking in and out with the on-air light on. 
[01:45:00]  We have fucking...  Bananas too big, dude.  Yeah.  I know.  Exactly.  Straight and straight.  You're never going to get all that in.  That's a big straight banana.  Yeah, but see, I keep half the fucking peel on,  and then I just cut it into my oatmeal.  Exactly.  Now when you're 19, you have it surgically fixed.  It takes the eroticism right out of eating up the banana.  What's the fun of that, then?  Banana.  All right, good.  So what, Dennis?  No, I was just telling you to be better. 
[01:45:30]  What were you saying?  I was something, a throwaway that Travis had said.  Is that in hell?  Why are you laughing?  He thinks that E-Rock should have to moo and then say,  I'm the fat, lazy gash cow.  Oh, you know, it's not a bad idea,  just in case people aren't, you know, part of the contest.  Right.  It's called spoon-feeding the audience.  Let's give it a shot.  Yeah, that sounds...  I think so, and you've got to keep pumping it up all the time.  You just can't mention it now.  You've got to keep mentioning it.  And E-Rock, you've got to sound enthusiastic about this. 
[01:46:00]  It's 500 bucks here.  Don't just moo.  Like HBO.  Right.  Yeah, the fat, lazy, cash cow is going to give away $500.  So it's moo, I'm the fat, lazy, cash cow.  Yeah, not happening.  Come on, we need that.  Come on, it's showbiz.  Do it.  You're bumming everyone out.  You're bumming Dennis out.  Remember when E-Rock would do anything for this show?  Exactly.  Now he won't even moo and say he's a fat, lazy, cash cow.  Right.  Come on, E-Rock, we need this for the contest.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  It's harmless.  Moo.  I'm not doing the other part.  Oh, come on.  First of all, it was a terrible moo.  That wasn't a good moo.  You know cows don't moo.  You can't do a cow impression.  It's got to be moo.  Yeah.  I'm sick.  I'm the fat, lazy, cash cow.  Yeah.  And then maybe go, oh, my God, in honor of Louis' special.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get, oh, my God, in there somehow.  I'm the fat, lazy, cash cow. 
[01:47:00]  See, I can do it.  Yeah, do it in a voice, then people don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice, big, long, loud moo.  Moo.  You can do it as the virus.  I cannot do it at all.  Dennis, that was a good one.  That was a good one.  The moo was good.  You got to follow it up.  No.  Oh, come on.  You got the moo.  There you go.  Would you fire him for not performing?  Come on, you're not being a team player.  No, I'm not.  Come on.  You know, you're going to be part of the show here.  You're going to be a team player. 
[01:47:30]  A team player.  I love his enthusiasm.  You got to pick up the slack.  Come on, it's Thursday.  There's only one other option.  What day is today?  Thursday?  It's Thursday, one day before the weekend, right?  Thursday, Thursday.  Everybody's in a weekend mode already.  It's in between hump day and Friday, right?  Yeah.  What do they call Thursdays, usually?  I don't really have anything for Thursdays.  It's the other Friday, I call it.  The other Friday?  The other Friday.  Yeah, we'll call it four Mondays away.  All right.  The radio's terrible.  Happy hump day.  E-Rock, why won't you do it?  It's a character. 
[01:48:00]  You're not saying, I'm E-Rock, although we should have him go, I'm E-Rock, the fat, lazy cash cow.  But we're just asking you to say...  Yeah, that would have been mean.  Yeah.  You don't have to say mean.  We're just asking you to go, I'm the fat, lazy cash cow.  We got to get this money away.  Then give it away.  You don't need me to do it.  Yes, we do.  No, you don't.  You're an integral part of the show.  They need you to do it.  I already gave it away.  Yeah.  It's the wrestling stuff.  Come on, E-Rock.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Did you give away my wrestling stuff?  Oh. 
[01:48:30]  Did you hear about...  You missed WrestleMania, too, Ant.  You missed a lot of good times.  Yeah, I know.  Did you hear about what Opie did to piss off E-Rock?  I didn't mean to.  Yes, you did.  Potentially did it.  E-Rock bought Opie's son some John Cena wristbands and headbands.  And as soon as E-Rock left the room, Opie left him on his console and said, give him away to a caller on the after show.  And it really, really bothered Eric.  Oh, did it bother you, really?  Yeah, of course it did.  Why? 
[01:49:00]  He rocks the sensitive boy.  We've seen it.  Why did it bother you?  What bothered me was you said you wanted this for somebody else to bring it to work tomorrow.  And I said, okay.  And then you pulled that dick move.  Oh, dick move.  Remember when you were his hero and he shed some tears over that?  And then remember recently during the drunk fest when he was crying again, saying that he ruined the show.  So he's a very sensitive boy.  Well, we got an E-Rock drunk bit that we're going to play here in a minute, by the way. 
[01:49:30]  See what I just did there, Dennis?  Yes.  I tied it into our conversation.  Maybe we could just play the drunk bit, as when you hear the drunk bit.  No, no.  No!  Oh, we got to hear the cash cow.  I do need wrestling stuff from my brother-in-law's friend.  Oh, boy.  You gave it away.  I don't really like giving my son too much wrestling stuff.  Why?  I don't believe in it.  It's still real to me, damn it.  The only other thing we could do is have Sal be the princess cash cow.  You know? 
[01:50:00]  This is Dennis Falcone's bit.  Who do you want to do the mooing?  I mean, I think you were doing it before, E-Rock.  But you do want him to, you know.  He's got to get into it.  He just can't, you know.  He's got to get into it.  And we need the fat, lazy cash cow line.  You've got to have it, right?  Yeah.  Why, E-Rock?  And, oh, my God.  I'm going to put that in there, too.  Well, people want to do their moves.  This guy says he has a really good one.  Mark in Iowa.  Mark.  Yeah, I can do one.  I can show you how a fat calf, which is a young calf, calls her calf, her little baby, if you want. 
[01:50:30]  Okay.  All right.  Okay, I'm in my truck.  I've got to kind of hold the phone away.  Here we go.  All right.  That's how they call their babies.  Wow, that's terrific.  It was hard to hear you because of the phone.  Nice.  You want it up to the phone?  Yeah, if you could.  Yeah, we didn't really hear it.  Okay, I'll do it a little closer.  Here we go.  This is pretty amazing.  How was that?  That's too high.  It sounds, for sure, it's realistic.  No, when they do that, that means they're upset.  They want their calf.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:00]  Wait, and how does it sound?  I'm telling you, and they'll fuck you up if you're fucking up.  How does it sound?  How does it sound, though?  Nice metal bolt to the brain.  No one else heard it?  Do you want me to do it into the phone again?  Yes.  Yes, please.  All right, here we go.  How's that?  Where's the guy from No Country for Old Men to put that fucking thing against his head?  What are you, a moo master or something? 
[01:51:30]  Well, I'm telling you, I call them, I put their little legs in the phone.  A moo master.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  What are you, a moo master?  With young Roland.  Roland, are you mad at E-Rock because he's not doing his part here today?  I could do a good cow.  Huh?  I could do a good cow.  Okay, hop in there.  Hop on mic.  Share a mic.  Wait, Roland's going to do a cow.  Slobo! 
[01:52:00]  Roland!  Could do when you hear Roland do Slobo.  That's true.  For the $500 courtesy of HBO.  That might work.  What about the cow?  I agree.  We need the cash cow.  Wait, you want a good cow impression?  Here it goes.  Hey, I'm a bunch of hamburgers or something.  Oh, God.  We still need E-Rock to give us a good cow.  A fat, lazy cash cow.  Fat, lazy cash cow. 
[01:52:30]  E-Rock, what are you willing to do?  I gave you the moo.  That's it.  If we need more.  That's not what we need.  Yeah, let's negotiate a little bit.  Give us what we need for once.  Yeah.  We got a guy.  He's the two-time moo champion.  Oh, let's hear him.  Yeah?  All right.  Hold on.  Yes.  Mooing jizz buckets.  You're on the phone.  Don in Texas.  All right.  What's his name?  Let me show you how professional does this shit, all right?  Huh?  That's how professional wins. 
[01:53:00]  I do have to ask.  Did you actually win a ribbon?  Oh, he's gone.  He's serious.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's the two-time champion.  You win a hollow point bullet.  You should install.  Does that sound like a cow?  No, he actually said moo.  Yeah.  Moo. 
[01:53:30]  E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  Loosen up.  Not a team player.  Exactly.  Sam's got a good idea.  Since you can't do that to your belt.  Sam in South Carolina.  Sam.  I bet if you squeeze one of his udders, he'll move.  Oh, wow.  That's...  E-Rock, you want to comment on that?  That's very fucking rude.  Oh, comment E-Rock.  I didn't know he was going to say that.  I'm sorry.  E-Rock.  You want to comment?  E-Rock, he's still...  No?  He's sobbing. 
[01:54:00]  E-Rock?  No.  And they're just chewing bubble cut.  Bubble cut.  He took his baseball cards and went home, E-Rock.  He's very upset.  So what are we going to do?  Just have E-Rock moo?  No, that's lame.  Yeah, that is lame.  He's not playing along very nice.  Oh, E-Rock.  What else could you give us with the moo, E-Rock?  What are you willing to do?  Yeah, that's a good idea. 
[01:54:30]  You got the moo.  You got the moo.  Come on, give us one more.  Come on.  With a little something.  Yeah, just do it.  Do it for me.  Moo, you cocksucker.  Do it for Uncle Danny, right?  I don't know.  He doesn't, uh...  He's not playing.  He's not playing nice.  He's ready.  He's ready.  He's spoiled here.  Let's go.  Moo.  Go fuck yourself.  That's good.  I...  Is it, uh... 
[01:55:00]  No, it's just mean...  That's not how cows don't say that.  No.  Cows introduce themselves.  I would really like...  You know...  He doesn't like self-deprecation.  That's weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Self-deprecation.  Fat jokes.  Oh.  Everyone knows you're not really fat.  Really?  Do they?  It's good, clean fun.  Exactly.  Clean fun.  Brendan Burns came in here the other day flabbergasted at what E-Rock looks like. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Because he just listened to the show and he wanted to meet E-Rock.  And he goes, you're not that fat.  What are they talking about?  That's why it's a great fit.  He goes, you're just a guy with a little extra weight.  Just a little.  Do you know how good we make you look E-Rock?  No, you don't.  You don't paint a nice picture at all.  No, we do.  Because people meet you and then they're like, wow, you're not a disaster.  Wow, he really got his life together.  Yeah.  That's what they think.  Here comes handsome Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  Right.  They'd be like, what?  That's a fat guy.  Sex bagel.  Right.  Sex bagel.  I got a picture of him at WrestleMania. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's not me either.  What?  They think it's you.  They look like you.  Posted that it was me.  Hmm?  They're going to show Ant.  He was online getting food.  Oh, I saw that picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  That's a picture of E-Rock and the character.  Oh, what's this character?  I know already.  Wait, what was he called?  We debuted him yesterday.  Oh.  Grapey Cheeks.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  What was this?  Grape Cheeks.  Grape Cheeks.  It was Grape Cheeks.  I figured, like, how'd you guess that?  Jim's characters are like fucking sci-fi original movie titles.  He's got Grape's in the cheeks.  What should we call them?  Grape Cheeks.  All right, Dennis.  Your bid is falling flat here, I guess.  So how are we going to give away the $500?  He doesn't want to be a part of it.  I don't know why.  That would have been a great one.  Do you have a clip of Louie from the special that you want to play?  Why?  When you hear a clip of Louie? 
[01:57:00]  No.  It hasn't aired yet.  Yeah.  No, that could be an older clip of Louie.  No.  We don't want to do that.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Come up with something else.  Okay.  We're trying to brainstorm on something here.  Let's see.  What else could we do?  I thought we had something.  Yeah, I thought we had something here.  We'd have.  We'd have been great.  Are we giving up on the Moo?  Do you rock the Moo?  No.  He won't follow it up.  He won't follow the funny part.  Yeah.  We need the funny part, you rock.  Do I win the 500 bucks?  What?  No. 
[01:57:30]  You already got the Nagel fortune.  What's 500 bucks to you?  I'm your bag of shells.  Maybe we can have some more tequila.  I don't bring up that.  No?  Okay.  We're moving on from that.  No?  Okay.  We're moving on from that.  Maybe Sal could play the drums again.  No.  Oh, boy.  No.  That whole thing was not successful.  You guys want Sal to be the closeted homosexual?  Cash cow?  No.  Closeted.  Doesn't work as well.  Cash cow, obviously, you rock.  Fat, lazy cash cow.  I just said, obviously, you rock. 
[01:58:00]  Why'd you say that?  You pumped it up to a comfortable level.  Why is it obviously, you rock?  Because he was moving earlier.  Why would you make him move?  I don't understand.  What?  You mean because he's fat?  I didn't say that.  Well.  What are we going to do?  We wanted a cash cow.  You got another radio contest?  Another radio contest.  Let's see.  You can't keep track of the music because you guys don't play music.  Keep track of the music. 
[01:58:30]  Write it down.  Here's the first of 10 in a row.  Write it down.  Write down music for a prize.  No, they don't.  People do it.  Losers do.  All right.  What was the number five song?  They'll tell you.  Number five was Bruno Mars.  Number four was.  Because they have no lives.  You know what they were called?  Tell the people.  Contest pigs.  There you go.  Wow.  And that was the right answer.  Why do you like to call them repeat customers?  Oh, you did?  The general manager told me.  Everyone else.  I called them repeat customers.  Everyone else on the radio just would call them contest pigs.  You knew them by name.  And they would get mad because they were the eighth caller when you were looking for the 
[01:59:00]  ninth caller.  They would call up on Friday.  What are you guys giving away this weekend?  It's well known.  They were called contest pigs.  Have the speed dials?  Yeah.  They had all their phones, programs.  They were professionals.  They were repeat customers.  And then you had to look up their name and go, oh, fuck, this broad won last week.  If you or any member of your family has won something in the past 30 days, please, give  someone else a chance to win. 
[01:59:30]  You didn't want to say, you can't win.  You have to be nice to them.  As a broadcast professional, that's what I would do.  Be nice to them.  All right.  Well, we didn't get anything accomplished here.  We have $500 thanks to HBO.  And nothing to do with it.  Because of Louis C.K.'s, oh, my God, special.  That's going to be on HBO Saturday at 10.  Sure.  I'm coughing.  I have the cough button on.  Stop facking it.  All right.  We're going to break.  We've got Dan Aykroyd on the way. 
[02:00:00]  And the Sopranos brought.  Oh, my God.  And we're going to try to figure out how to give away this $500.  Thank you, Dennis Falcone.  Thank you, gentlemen.  DennisFalcone.com.  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  We've got a legend outside our studio. 
[02:00:30]  No, I'm back in.  We all went to claim legendary status.  A weak joke.  We all grabbed for it, too, joke-wise.  Terrible people.  Dan Aykroyd.  Yeah, he is.  Good morning.  Good morning, Dan.  Dan Aykroyd, take a seat, sir.  Gentlemen, really?  It's just like that, is it?  Yeah.  Right on the air.  Opie.  Hi.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Indeed.  Good.  Nice to meet you.  People call you by your first and last name, because that would be so odd if someone  just went, Anthony Cumia.  But it's like, you feel compelled to just go, hey, Dan Aykroyd. 
[02:01:00]  Well, you know, the police call me Mr. Aykroyd.  Oh, they do.  My mother calls me Daniel.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, of course, you know, Chevy Chase, Murray, Martin, sure, they all call me Aykroyd.  Why didn't you say Marty?  You should have said Marty Short.  Marty Short, yeah.  Marty Short.  Don't you feel like you're in on some when you hear, like, people talking about their celebrity  friends like that?  Ah, yeah, Marty Short.  Me and Chuck Heston. 
[02:01:30]  We were out in Vegas.  I know.  I don't mean to name drop, but I could drop a few.  Yeah, I think you could.  You probably could.  Yeah, yeah.  I actually met and interviewed Jimmy Hoffa once.  Wow.  No way.  Really?  Yeah, it was up.  Recently?  Well, we put it back together for that one.  No, that was up in a show called Everything Goes, and it was a 90-minute variety show, just  like Saturday Night Live, kind of.  The two of them we did back-to-back, and I was the young interviewer writing on the  show, and Jimmy Hoffa was plugging his book, so they put me in a room with him for about 
[02:02:00]  45 minutes.  I saw it before someone plugged him.  It was...  Wow.  How was it?  I never saw that coming.  I couldn't warn him.  No.  He was very polite.  He was funny.  He's, you know, and he did not like the Kennedys, but he made that clear.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wasn't Bobby Kennedy especially gunning for the union, saying that there was mob influence  and all that stuff?  Yeah, and I think, you know, history will bear out that there was some financial involvement there.  Sure, sure.  Went to the black side, if we might say that.  A little bit.  Wow.  What year did you interview him? 
[02:02:30]  That's fascinating.  That was, oh, God, that's in the 70s, like 72, 71, 72.  Wow, man.  A hundred pounds ago in a hundred years.  That's a good resume stuffer.  Yeah, yeah.  We've got to mention that Dan's here for the vodka post.  We certainly want to talk about a bunch of things, but we definitely want to mention you  got the vodka.  I heard you brought samples.  Well, I want to show you.  Oh, you know what?  It's not going to be a surprise to me, sir.  You don't have a...  I have this vodka prominently displayed on my bar at my house. 
[02:03:00]  You don't have a guy that walks around with your vodka for you, Dan Aykroyd?  I hauled it over.  You hauled it yourself, huh?  I hauled it over.  I hope you've cracked that bottle and tried it.  Oh, hell yeah.  I've been through plenty of them.  People know when they come over to my house, they bring Crystalette Vodka.  Ah, good.  Yeah.  Ah, so you're a discriminating taster.  I love it.  Going backwards, we just won the Pradexpo in Moscow, meaning best vodka out of 400 excellent  tastes.  We won two gold medals.  Now, if Russians don't know superior vodka...  No kidding.  There you go. 
[02:03:30]  And then we won the World Spirits Competition in 2011 in San Francisco with a 90-plus rating,  and our notes are sweet, vanilla, dry, crisp, with a kick of heat off the finish.  Whoa.  Why?  A kick of heat off the finish.  You know that vodka can say there's a kick of heat.  They're afraid of heat.  That is.  And lesser vodkas, what they do, the less expensive ones, is they mask the alcohol by  putting three substances in it.  And you're not going to want lesser vodka after you hear what they put into vodka.  First, they put propylene glycol, which is a preservative. 
[02:04:00]  It's an antifreeze.  It was used to cool Spitfire engines in World War II.  Now, you don't want that in your vodka.  It's kind of cool in that aspect, but you don't want it in your vodka.  No.  No, I mean, it's because it's a harsh chemical, and they do that to mask the alcohol and produce  a viscosity that isn't always there.  Ours is smooth naturally.  And then they put lemonine in.  That's a bug exterminant or a caustic cleanser.  Remember Billy May, that great salesman?  He used to take a mustard squeezer.  Sure.  So you have this thick of automobile grease, and he'd just take that citrus oil and would 
[02:04:30]  cut right through it, like the laser cutting James Bond in half in Goldfinger.  Yes.  He was going right for the, you know.  And so that's limonene is bad.  You don't like that.  And then they put sugar in there.  Now, you don't need sugar in C2H506.  You don't need any more sugar.  So we are H2O, C2H506.  Just water and the mash.  That's it.  We're winning awards all over the world.  And our challenge is to make people aware to crack the bottle.  What they do is they take them, and they bring them home as collector's items, and they don't 
[02:05:00]  drink it.  They don't open it because it looks really cool.  It looks good, but it looks good empty.  Oh, wow.  That looks beautiful.  It looks good filled with M&Ms, or model airplane paint, or colored sand.  If you get on our website, World Wide Web, crystalhead.com, you'll see people from all  over the world have sent in art projects with the empty bottles.  So the bottle was designed by John Alexander.  He's an American artist.  I think it was designed by the Lord at first, sir.  You're so correct. 
[02:05:30]  You're so correct.  We're going to use that.  Exactly right.  Yes.  That is cool.  We all have one of them.  That's what's great about it.  Mr. Aykroyd, can we back up, though?  How did you get into the vodka business?  I'm fascinated by this.  Because you're really into vodka now.  Well, you know, what I did was I worked with Patron in Canada, Patron Spirits, you know,  the wonderful Patron XO, and the dark XO, and the Añejo.  I brought that into Canada because I was tired of making margaritas with inferior products. 
[02:06:00]  So I asked the guys at Patron, can I bring it into my little government liquor store  in my little village in my little rural area up there?  And they said, well, you've got to bring it to the whole country.  So I imported it to Canada, and now Patron is the best-selling luxury brand up there.  We represent a good percentage of foreign sales for Patron, and I started to look at  other opportunities.  My friend had the idea for the bottle, and in about two minutes, you know, he had drawn  it up, and I looked at it, and I thought, we've got to put a pure, unadulterated, non-polluted 
[02:06:30]  zero-additive fluid in here.  The bottle's so beautiful.  Why would you put anything with pollutants in it?  It's based on the Mitchell Hedges skull, which was one of the 13 crystal heads.  There were 13 in the world.  Five of them are missing, eight of them in the possession of mankind.  They were supposed to have had powers for the Navajo, the Aztec, the Mayan, use them  as crystal balls.  They're supposed to come from the star children in the Spielberg movie, Indiana Jones and the  Crystal Skulls.  It's alluded that they did come from another planet.  So tying that all into our sales myth, what we're selling really is enlightened drinking 
[02:07:00]  and drinking that has no junk in it.  John Alexander was one of my best friends.  We met at Saturday Night Live.  I was dating one of the writers there, a beautiful lady named Rosie, and he basically stole her  away from me.  That's how we met.  And so there's a nice story there.  But I'm not sure where she is today, but I can get him on the phone because he's my evil  partner.  And so we drew this bottle up and we put the fluid in it.  It's made by the government's facility in Newfoundland.  Now, I know governments aren't very popular these days, but governments that make vodka are 
[02:07:30]  very popular.  It's amazing how smart that, like, when you look at that, like, to see that on your shelf,  like, everybody would want to at least try that.  Like, that's a really smart marketing thing.  And the name is great.  Crystal Head Vodka is a great name for a product.  Not, yeah.  It's a skull, but we don't call it a skull.  We see it as a living thing, just like the Navajo, the Mayans, the Aztecs saw it as a living  crystal.  Of course, it's not crystal because that has lead in it.  That's bruny glass.  And it has a little grin to it.  Now, so that's our naked bottle right there.  Now, any Stones fans around here? 
[02:08:00]  I like them.  Oh, yeah.  To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stones and their tour coming up, we went to  Bravado at Universal, which is their marketing arm.  We went through Canada to do this.  And Mick and Keith and the boys agreed that this would be a fun thing to do.  And we have devised.  They've done some fun things in their day.  Yes, they have.  So, this is the Rolling Stones commemorative tour pack. 
[02:08:30]  Look at that.  Wow, how cool is that?  Yes, isn't that great?  It's the Sticky Fingers zipper.  Yep.  In a little stage.  And in order for us to encourage people to crack the bottle and actually drink it, the bottle's inside, we have a stopper.  So, you take out the cork after you undo our safety seal, our Tylenol safety seal. 
[02:09:00]  And then you have this beautiful head stocker that goes here.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  That encourages you to drink what's in the bottle.  And then, also, the best part of this package.  And this is great.  I mean, this is really, this is what makes it so, I guess, emotional for me, is that I'm a long-time Stones fan.  I stan.  I've known Keith and Ronnie mainly.  And I know Mick, of course.  But I'm closer to Keith and Ronnie because they've been in my house.  And I've had Keith stay in my house a couple of times. 
[02:09:30]  And I love the boys so much.  I love hanging with them.  Mick picked all of the songs that you get in the tray in the bottom here.  There's 14 live tracks.  Whoa.  14 live tracks from the Stones picked by Mick personally.  And the vodka.  And the stopper.  And a sticker if you want to put it on there.  And, you know.  That is great.  Every man is going to want this of our, you know, demographic.  I'm younger and older, of course.  And every woman who has a man is going to want to buy it for them.  I mean, this is the Father's Day gift. 
[02:10:00]  That is badass.  It'll look great in the man cave, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Oh, I'll be with you.  I have one.  Yeah?  Yeah, in the man cave.  I have one.  You have a man cave, right?  I know.  Every man should have a man cave.  Yeah.  It's a Kwanzaa hut.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's an amazing package.  Isn't that neat?  That's pretty.  Yeah, that's cool.  Pretty damn cool right there.  And there's a zipper on the front, which I like.  Yeah.  What are some of the live songs?  I'm going to leave this here for you.  Oh, my God.  What are some of the live songs?  Well, there's...  I want to see if they got lazy or not.  Let me see. 
[02:10:30]  They're all on here somewhere.  Just a few.  I had the card here.  Let me see.  A little Midnight Rambler, you think?  I saw that.  Did it make the cut?  Yeah.  Nice.  How much is it?  Here we go.  Beast of Burden, Angie.  These are all live tracks that make.  He said, I want the best live tracks for this.  Brown Sugar, Let's Spend the Night Together.  Shattered, Painted Black, Gimme Shelter, Wild Hornet.  Horses, Shine a Light, Rocks Off, Miss You, Get What You Want.  These are the hits.  Yeah.  Honky Tonk Women, Jump and Jack Flash. 
[02:11:00]  So you get the two seats.  They had a few hits, huh?  They did.  They had a few hits.  And, boy, is it going to be a great tour coming up.  Oh, my God.  Man, right?  You know, everybody's got to come out the door for that.  I think they've already sold out the tickets.  I don't tell.  A regular bottle of your vodka, how much does a regular bottle cost?  In the States here, if you go to a big chain like Sam's Club, Costco, something like that,  you can get it for around $45 to $46.  It's a premium product.  It's a luxury spirit. 
[02:11:30]  We're not hiding that.  It is government manufactured, as I said.  And you're paying for the custom glass, the bottle, the package.  And the government manufacturer, the shipping from Newfoundland, Canada, where it's made.  Now, we make it there because the water is this original glacial water.  When the glacier melted, you know, 16,000 years ago, 800 feet above the planet, it all  went into Newfoundland, which is kind of like a big, rocky sponge.  And so we draw on that water to make the vodka.  Yeah, that's some clean stuff right there.  Yeah.  I like that.  I like this. 
[02:12:00]  I don't drink at all.  And I want one of these in my house.  Okay, well, I'm going to leave each of you gentlemen with one when I leave, and you can keep the  gift pack here.  You know what it is about this vodka?  You are absolutely correct in the fact that you've got to be reminded to open it.  Because I had the head sitting up in my bar, and I was drinking everything else that was  laying around.  And finally, I was just like, let me try this.  Yeah.  And it's fantastic. 
[02:12:30]  And people now, when they come over, they know to bring that vodka, the crystal head,  the vodka over to my house.  Look how happy Jim Aykroyd is.  I love it.  He's very happy.  I'm not kidding.  I love this.  And you're an amazing pitch man.  I've realized.  Yeah.  You've been pitching for a while.  Willie Loman, here I come.  Well, he's using the Basimatic pitch, which, of course, is fantastic.  How many people have given you bad ideas?  Like, if you want people to open it, you should hook up a little motor where the mouth opens 
[02:13:00]  and it goes, open me, open me.  That wouldn't be bad, actually.  We have a billboard in L.A. on the side of the Avalon Dance Club there in Hollywood.  And it's a woman, you know, like, curves in her hands and her hip and the head is right  there.  And we have try me underneath and taste me.  Mm-hmm.  So, you know, that's the push.  It's the bartender's friend.  It makes a great cold shot, of course.  And you can drink it, you know, frozen or whatever.  But the thing is, because there's no additives, bartenders and bar chefs, mixologists, are 
[02:13:30]  adding so much anyway.  Red Bull, Clamato, St. Germain, Vermouth.  So why not start with a vodka that has nothing in it?  And they're finding that all over the world, in Europe, especially where they're doing this  molecular mixing and that.  They're adding sugar, blueberries, ants on a log, peanut butter.  It's amazing.  You know, in San Francisco, you can get a salad and a drink, you know, from the bartender's  guild.  So they enjoy the clean slate aspect of it.  Very cool.  And, you know, we just, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  I want to ask you, how was it going back to SNL recently?  Oh, that was fun.  It was well-written, that show, which made it great.  Now, that Justin Timberlake, he's got real talent.  He's talented, huh?  He really is.  I mean, you know, he's somebody that got into show business really young, but he had the  goods to take it all away.  And, in fact, it was his idea to have us on the show.  When he was a kid at Disney watching reruns of SNL, he loved the Czech Brothers.  All right.  Come and swing.  Why not?  We'll swing with that man.  Why not?  So we invited Steve.  He invited Steve and myself to come on the show, and we did the Czech Brothers, and then 
[02:14:30]  they wrote that five-timers thing, which was really neat.  That was amazing.  Yeah, that was kind of documentary history right there.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't realize how many people have done it that many times.  Yeah.  Just amazing.  We've got to ask you, of course, about Caddyshack 2.  Look, I hate to bring up the bad.  What was all this?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I don't talk about the bad movies, but...  Oh, yeah, you don't?  No, that was...  Because I've wondered over the years. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  Okay.  I just wanted to know the motive.  That was a favor.  That was a favor.  Yeah, they were stuck, and they needed Chevy and I, and so the guy from Warners, who was  an executive, a friend of ours that we made spies like us with, said, please, please, you've  got to bail me out here, so...  You are a good friend.  We showed up, and...  We showed up.  Yeah, I mean, I'm...  You know, I've got some AAA releases out there, but I'm very proud of...  No, we're huge fans.  Don't even be confused.  Huge fans for the moment. 
[02:15:30]  Everybody has a few, you know...  Do you know, Trading Places, we were just talking about that.  You could still watch that today, and it's just as funny.  Yeah.  I mean, it holds up over time.  Hilarious.  Very good.  Your character, great.  And, of course, the lovely Jamie Lee Curtis, before she was doing the yoga commercials.  Wow.  Wow, what a body on her.  Said you were the best on-screen kisser that she ever worked with.  Oh.  Well, it takes two to do that, and movie kissing is kind of deceiving.  It looks more passionate than it is, but Jamie, I consider her like my sister in the business. 
[02:16:00]  We made four movies together.  She is a fabulous woman.  You know, what's great about her is just her attitude in terms of how she loves the crew.  You know, she'll have a...  If there are kids on the set, like in My Girl, you know, she had a swear box.  Everybody had to put five bucks in if they said that.  Oh, really?  How much did you have to put in there?  I put a few in.  A few in, yeah.  But, no, that was a nice afternoon, shooting that scene, believe me.  What was your first jump into, like, more serious roles?  Because you do both.  I mean, you're a very good serious actor. 
[02:16:30]  Well, let me see now.  Now, I guess, I suppose, you know, Driving Miss Daisy, probably, you know, even though  that was kind of light and there was some comedy in it and that, but, and then the My Girl  movies, which, you know, women between the age of 22 and 30 only know me as that father.  Really?  Yeah.  I can go through anywhere.  I'd say, you know, are you the father for My Girl?  That's what I get now.  You're not Ghostbusters, not Blues Brothers, not anything else. 
[02:17:00]  So, I am the father in My Girl.  That was one damn sad little movie.  It was sad, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was very sad.  They killed Macaulay Culkin.  And, of course, I, the marketer, go to the producer, John Peters, and say, you can't  kill Macaulay Culkin.  What are you doing?  No, no, wait, wait.  Let's see.  This will never work.  I said, no, this is not going to happen.  First of all, people wake up on the embalming table all the time.  He was stung by a beat.  Okay, so he's in a coma, right?  All right.  And then I'm putting the cannula on him.  And he wakes up.  He wakes up and everything's fine. 
[02:17:30]  And they go off with the butterflies.  Why are you going to kill him?  And, of course, that would have been totally wrong if they had not killed him.  Because it wouldn't have been the movie it was.  That was rough.  That was terrible.  That was terrible.  When she goes into the funeral, she's crying.  And then she comes down the stairs to see Macaulay in the other room dead.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Yes.  That was, yeah.  That brought you up to the red.  Now, that was written by a woman whose father owned a funeral home.  I've never won an Emmy for writing SNL.  I've been nominated for a Grammy, Best New Artist, Blues Brothers 1979. 
[02:18:00]  I've been nominated for an Academy Award.  But I've never won an Academy Award or a Grammy.  However, I have won the California Undertakers Association Award.  For Sympathetic Portrayal of a Funeral Director.  Really?  Yes.  That's one of my proudest plaques right there.  Sympathetic portrayal.  So it wasn't the gruesome kind of guy that everybody pictures.  That's next.  And any time you play a funeral director and you don't walk in with Dracula music,  you're like, all right, he gets us.  Instead, I had a tuba. 
[02:18:30]  I thought Neighbors was a very underrated comedy.  It was a weird movie.  But with Kathy Moyarty, I really enjoyed that.  Yeah, we switched parts there.  They wanted me to play the other part.  And we said, no, let's play it.  It was written by a guy named Joseph Berger, a New Jersey novelist.  And you know what was great?  He really supported what we were doing.  And we shot it over in Staten Island there near the old mental asylum.  That was very interesting.  Worked nights the whole time.  And built that house.  Built the power lines there.  And that was all our construction.  And it was a little bizarre. 
[02:19:00]  But we had fun.  We had fun on it.  And now, you know, you can't hardly get that film.  I can't find that on DVD.  A lot of people like that.  Yeah, true.  Yeah, yeah.  No one isn't readily available.  Can I ask you, what is your favorite?  Because you're known as a big conspiracy guy.  What is your, not favorite, but what is your most passionate conspiracy?  Oh, jeez.  Well, conspiracy, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Well, I mean, in terms of assassinations or, I mean, what, chemtrails? 
[02:19:30]  I mean, what, you know.  Assassinations or government problems?  Well, I think the, you know, the government conspires to keep things from us all the time.  I think one of the biggest conspiracies is the loss of $20 billion of our taxpayer money  in two really bad wars and Katrina.  I mean, look at where the money went.  It went into pallets into Iraq and was taken out the back door in metal trunks. 
[02:20:00]  And Katrina, $4 billion gone there in theft.  Iraq, Afghanistan, the money's just disappearing.  And that's money that you and I have to pay.  And by the way, these new higher tax rates that everyone's going to have to pay,  the middle class, are based on what money was worth 25 years ago.  So you're being taxed on a dollar that's worth 47 cents today.  And so very unfair to tax us and then misspend the money.  I mean, government is really a mess down there.  I can't believe that.  You know, that's just...  I don't see it as much as conspiracy as I do complete incompetence. 
[02:20:30]  I just see people that have an undying supply of cash.  So they don't have to be thrifty with it.  Because, I mean, what recourse do we have?  Hey, I'm not paying you.  And then you go to prison.  Well, that's right.  Or you move to another country.  But people did conspire to steal all of that.  Especially the money in Iraq that went out the back door in pallets.  Shrink-wrapped and out to some...  Like Goodfellas.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Who knows? 
[02:21:00]  You'll pay me.  Yeah.  Just bring it up.  Yeah.  What was his name?  Maury.  Maury.  Yeah.  Maury.  Where's my money?  Fuck him, that cigarette hijacking Mick.  Where's my money?  Where's my money?  Where's my money?  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, did you...  I mean, obviously SNL at the beginning and Lorne.  It just seemed from what I've seen in interviews and documentaries that it was a very kind of,  hey, we don't quite know what we're doing, but this is kind of going to work.  And now to see Lorne where he is now, which is pretty much in charge of late night with Jimmy Fallon. 
[02:21:30]  Sure.  Did you have any inkling back then that this guy was the powerhouse that he would end up  being?  From the moment I met him.  Really?  Absolutely.  No.  This guy had it.  He started as a writer, performer, stand-up.  He had a partner named Hart Palmer Anson.  They used to do comedy.  Lorne had shoulder-length hair and a foo-manchu mustache when I met him.  But I knew right away.  He had a vision.  He knew what he wanted to do.  He knew talent.  He knew how to spot talent.  He knew how to use talent. 
[02:22:00]  And he was able to convince NBC to do not a pilot, but seven shows.  He said, you've got to give me seven because we'll get traction that way.  And he simply wanted to recreate the Colgate Comedy Hour, the Sid Caesar live experience.  And now today he's going to be having that late-night block.  I'm sure he wishes like I do that he did this 30 years ago, building an empire.  But he's going to have a lot of people on his side that are going to be good parts of his team. 
[02:22:30]  And he's my boss.  Yeah, yeah.  He's your boss.  Oh, yeah.  Anytime he calls, I'm there.  Yeah, it really is something, looking over the years, because it didn't seem to be that organized when you guys were on.  Well, no, there was definitely chaos.  I mean, we would be writing.  The secretaries would be typing at four in the morning.  I had bunk beds there that Johnny and I slept in.  I had them put a shower in for me because I used to sleep over to get the things rewritten and stuff. 
[02:23:00]  And, you know, you'd go, you'd put a piece in, and they'd have to build the set in nine hours.  And, you know, there were only, you know, just a few cast members and only like seven or eight writers.  So there wasn't, you know, you could blow, you know, snow through the 17th floor, you know, sometimes.  Really?  And now, you know, every assistant has an assistant.  And they do a great job, but it's very overpopulated.  A different animal.  What was your first indication that it was really something that was not going to go away quickly? 
[02:23:30]  Like, what was the first, I mean, was it the first week or was it, you know?  It was, well, for me, it was the first moment that I went out on camera.  I was under the seats.  I was waiting to go on in a scene called Home Security where Gareth Morris and I break into a guy's home to show him that you'd better have a security system.  You know, and that's the way we sold it was breaking into homes.  And so we were sitting, I'm looking at him, he's looking, and I'm thinking, you know, boy, if this doesn't work, I do know a good price on a snow plow up in Canada. 
[02:24:00]  I can go back and do that.  And then, you know, I went out there and the scene started and people were laughing.  And John and Michael O'Donnell had done the Wolverine thing and then that had worked.  And I was thinking, oh, yeah, this could work.  This could work.  And then, of course, the George Carlin show was a big hit and because we had seven, you know, to prove to NBC that it could work.  Right.  Here we are, 30 was six years later.  Amazing, right?  How hard is it to, I've always amazed that SNL guys can, like, if a scene's not working, how hard is it to bomb in a scene when you just know the scene's not working and continue with it? 
[02:24:30]  And, like, how, to not break and just go, fuck, this is not working.  Well, let me put, you're talking about dying.  Yeah, like, just, you know.  Well, that is the most, and I think most, all comedians will tell you this, and you guys know a little bit about this.  You know, there's occasions when you do die.  It is the most exquisite feeling.  It's kind of wonderful, you know, to watch other people die. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, that's the best.  And to die.  To feel something dying.  I remember we did a sketch, I forget what it was called, Tom Davis and I wrote it.  And after we did it, Michael O'Donoghue walked up to me and said, that's the single worst piece of writing and performing I've ever seen on television.  And, you know, we died, and we knew we were dying, you know.  And you remember when Carson would do something, like, he would say something, a joke wouldn't work, and then he'd try to make it work and try to, and just dig himself deeper hole.  That, to me, was the greatest Latin. 
[02:25:30]  He would start dancing, they'd play the music, and he would dance.  You know, Carson dying, to me, was as funnier than anything.  Looking over to Ed.  So dying is exquisite.  We used to do it at Second City a lot, and walk out and go, geez, that audience sits.  Oh, boy, are they dead.  No, no, you're creatively dead, and that's why they weren't laughing.  But I bombed, I'm going to stand up.  So I bombed, in that realm, I understand how to do that, but I can address it.  And I can just, this stinks around, I can at least acknowledge it.  But in sketch, it seems so terrifying, because you have, you know, you have, you know, three more minutes of this, and you can't break that wall. 
[02:26:00]  Well, as Winston Churchill said, you know, when you're going through hell, keep going.  So that's what you do, you just go right through.  But you know, as a stand-up, how fun it is to see other stand-ups die.  There's nothing better.  And then, if you're dying, you can also, you know, turn it around to where it becomes a triumph sometimes.  Yeah.  If you die, you mean, you could die a horrible death.  Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, or you dig out of that hole, and you get a rocket, and then the next thing you know, next thing you're, you know, you're back on top. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  Bill Burr in Philly.  One of our guys was getting booed in front of, what, 10,000, 10,000, 12,000 people who used to do a little comedy tour.  And he was getting killed, and he turned the whole thing around and just beat the shit out of Philly as a city, as a whole.  Which made the booze even bigger, but by the end of it, to make it short, it was a standing ovation.  People were out of their minds for it.  There you go.  But he turned it around instead of sitting there, just, you know.  If nothing else, they realized how much he knew about Philly. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And how right he was.  Oh, my God.  It was an amazing night to see him do that.  When you're doing films, too, do you ever see a script that, like, you like, and it's going, and then as you start shooting it, they start making changes, and you're like, oh, this is not what I signed on for.  Oh, sure, sure.  That happens.  That happens a lot.  And you can only fight as much as you can for what you think your part should be and the role should be in the dialogue.  And, you know, try to appeal to the producers and the director if it's not working. 
[02:27:30]  But, you know, mostly I've been pretty fortunate because the material that I've started out with was pretty strong on the good movies.  On the good movies.  Is it hard to go out and promote a movie that you know you don't like?  Oh, well, you know what's great about promoting this vodka is that I'm not selling used battery acid here.  I mean, I'm selling a quadruple gold medal winning fluid that is just delicious.  People are loving it.  And so I walk in with confidence. 
[02:28:00]  I used to sell movies on a Wednesday that I knew were going to die on a Friday.  Wow.  I mean, I knew they were dead.  And this is the greatest comedy in all.  He and this director.  And I, you know, it was, you know, beating the horse until the bones showed, you know.  Yeah.  But it was one of those things.  I guess contractually you guys have to do it, right?  They're like you have to go out and promote it and there's nothing you can do.  It depends what's in the.  I don't.  Well, during the last sort of years of my peak motion picture career, and I had a good run in the 80s and 90s there,  I did not have any obligation to promote, but of course I wanted to because, you know, like a thing like Gross Point Blank, I love that movie. 
[02:28:30]  I wanted to let people know about it.  So even though I wasn't contracted, I did a few things for them promotional-wise.  Yeah, yeah.  Were you as into partying back then as a lot of the other people we hear about?  Well, I mean, I did try La Cocagna a couple of times, but it wasn't my thing.  It was only because it was around and, you know, instead of having coffee to stay up till three, that was the. 
[02:29:00]  But, you know, Johnny loved that.  He did that.  That made him, he was, you know, fighting some kind of, you know, he was numbing himself, fighting some kind of pain.  And so he liked the powders and the pills a little more and some of the other cast members and people in the business and in the movie industry.  But it was never my thing.  More on the green side for me and, you know, a little moderate use, you know.  Did you see that coming with, because a lot of people talk about Chris Farley and their friends were so concerned because you could kind of see it snowballing into a place that was very dangerous. 
[02:29:30]  Did you see that with Belushi or was it kind of one of the things where you didn't know how bad it was?  Oh, yeah, so, yeah, we flushed a lot of blow down the toilet and we hid it from him.  We hid the people, you know, we tried to separate him from the people that were giving him the stuff.  And we knew, you know, that we had to watch out for him.  It just came so suddenly.  And I wish I was out there then because, and this is what I think to myself to this day, if I had been there, I might have been able to do something to prevent it. 
[02:30:00]  Now, let's look to the bright side of things if you want to speculate.  If John were alive today, he would be probably one of the top directors on Broadway because he loved theater.  He was very smart that way.  And he would be one of these guys with a scarf and a hat blowing in with a cape and directing the great actors of our time.  And he would be in Broadway.  He'd be like an actor manager like David Garrett or somebody.  Right.  And, you know, I could see that that's where his life might have gone.  Where were you when you found out?  How did you find out?  Because the news was not passed back then the way it is today. 
[02:30:30]  There wasn't like just a Twitter or an explosion where everybody found out.  Well, I got a call.  I was writing Ghostbusters.  I was writing his line for Ghostbusters.  Wow.  Because he was supposed to be in it.  And then it was early in the morning and I was at our office on Fifth Avenue and Bernie Brillstein called and told me.  He was our agent and manager and he said that John was gone.  And, of course, my immediate thought was to get right to Judy right away so that she wouldn't find out on the radio.  So, and I ran, actually, it was a beautiful, beautiful day, March, beautiful March day. 
[02:31:00]  And I got out of the office and I ran to Judy's back down in the village there.  And on the way, I passed a newsstand and it was already on the newsstand.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, I got in there and, you know, that was tough.  It's tough when you have to tell someone.  No shit.  You know, you lose a brother, a husband or whatever.  Yeah, that was, you know, a dark moment and one that she, of course, triumphed over. 
[02:31:30]  And now we manage the Blues Brothers brand and she's a happy lady today.  And after something like that, which is just awful, creatively, did you take a long time before you could kind of come back?  Or was it one of those things where you could just bury yourself in being creative to kind of move on?  I stopped.  Yeah, I stopped.  Yeah, you know, it's casualty in that.  I mean, I knew I had to keep going and do something.  And then I went on to do the movie that I met my wife on, Dr. Detroit.  Yeah, yeah.  So, that turned out all right, yeah.  Oh, did you put Ghostbusters down for a while? 
[02:32:00]  Like, you just didn't want to continue?  Yeah, yeah.  It sort of went away.  It was really, when I was doing Trading Places, I began to redevelop Ghostbusters.  And then we got the present.  It was supposed to be Eddie Murphy, me, and Belushi.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's what I was writing in front of.  Wow.  So, Ghostbusters.  Wow.  It's coming in a nice, yeah.  Wow.  The look in the suits would have been really good.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I love funny spots.  And, you know, I'm chunky and John was Rotund.  I wasn't so chunky back then. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And so, did Eddie not want to do it?  By the time it came around, was he just off to doing his own thing?  I just think, I don't know what it was, how it evolved.  It just was, we got Murray.  And, you know, when I got with Harold and Ivan, we started to write the script, you know, and  so we got Murray.  And then Murray, you know, Bill added so much.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I, I, I, 50% of the success of that movie is because of his performance.  I mean, it's just great.  Yeah.  God damn.  Yeah.  So, fun stuff.  I'm always jealous of guys when you do John Candy well, too, right? 
[02:33:00]  Very well.  He was, he was a great friend of mine.  I, I think, uh, he's just one of the funniest guys ever on film.  Like, he could be funny doing, and just that big fucking head shape.  It was nothing better than John Candy.  Oh, and the STTV, uh, STTV work that he did was sensational.  Really, really, really great work.  Uh, yeah, John, uh, you know, he, uh, he, there was no drugs involved in his demise, unfortunately.  It was a congenital heart defect, but, um, he was, uh, he was, uh, so much fun.  And, of course, John Hughes wrote those movies. 
[02:33:30]  He was one of the most prolific writers, uh, at the time.  Yeah.  Also died prematurely, but, uh, but Candy and I started out together, uh, when we started  out, I was, uh, uh, a Royal Mail, uh, courier.  I was driving a mail truck, and he was a Kleenex salesman.  It was almost like a Del Griffith type of job.  He really had one.  He wore the brown suit.  He had the matching brown Pontiac.  He was like a clothes horse.  He was always dressed in the ring and the cigarette, you know, and Johnny LaRue.  Oh, he was beautiful.  Johnny LaRue, you know, he was so stylish. 
[02:34:00]  I could barely, you know, make it into a pair of jeans and a t-shirt after work.  You know, I'd take the mail cap off, and then I didn't know what to wear.  Um, but, uh, we started out at Second City, and we still had those jobs when we were at  Second City, and then we quit them to go full-time.  Wow, you did, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Geez, you, what, what point were you able to go, hey, I could quit my job?  Like, was it, uh, when, when, when Second City, uh, started to pay us, uh, we were, you know,  $235 a week, so we, we were able to, to stop the, uh, driving the mail truck, and then, 
[02:34:30]  uh, and then the Second City Theater closed.  The sheriff closed it down because, uh, of the, uh, the operator, uh, ran out of money and  couldn't pay the debt, and Second City was, uh, was rescued by, uh, another entrepreneur,  impresario, kind of in the Lorne Michaels vein, uh, named, uh, Guy Cavaliero, uh, named,  uh, no, his name is, um, yes, I, oh, my, uh, why am I slipping my name?  Andrew Alexander, sorry, there's many Alexanders in mind.  Andrew Alexander is his name, and, uh, he, uh, he saved Second City in, uh, in Toronto and 
[02:35:00]  got the TV show started, and, uh, and today is the Lorne Michaels of Second City.  Hmm. Do you think writing has changed in comedy since, like, when you look at the SNL  writing for those days, they talk on a lot of racial issues, like with Pryor and Chevy  Chase, and I don't just mean SNL, I mean, in general, it seems like people are so, uh,  frightened of repercussions for saying, instead of challenging social things, people are so  afraid of, of challenging them and getting in trouble for it.  Um, well, uh, I think they take on, you know, issues today pretty, you know, at SNL anyway, 
[02:35:30]  pretty, pretty head on, uh, in terms of culture and, and in terms of rappers.  And, uh, and, uh, performers, um, that, uh, that may, you know, that may, may push the  envelope, they, they, um, you know, they, they paradise, uh, pretty effectively.  Uh, I, I don't think they're afraid of any issues, um, uh, of course, drugs, I think,  are off the table now, uh, they can't really, uh, you know, uh, uh, we did a, you know,  we did a, you know, we did that sketch where the, uh, you know, the customs, uh, you know, 
[02:36:00]  they're coming through customs and that's the suitcase is just powder everywhere.  You don't see that so much anymore.  But, uh, but as far as, you know, taking on like racial stereotypes and cultural stereotypes,  as SNL, this is, is, is, is really, uh, really doing great work now.  And I watch all the time.  I love it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was there anything that, uh, they wanted you to tackle or any comedy wanted you to tackle  that you were like, ah, I just, I kind of would rather not.  Uh, no, I pretty much did everything I was assigned.  And, uh, you know, people would come to me and say, would you help me with this or being 
[02:36:30]  that it was, it was always a collaborative effort.  So I never, I never really, uh, backed off it.  I, uh, you know, I, I, I, I like to help people with, with their visions and, uh, and,  and, you know, and they helped me.  So, um, no, I never, uh, there was nothing that I really backed off of.  I, I didn't like doing update.  That's one thing.  I, I was uncomfortable in that seat.  Uh, that wasn't, that wasn't for me, you know?  No, no, no, no.  I, I, I like to have a wig, a funny walk, glasses, something to hide behind, you know,  to be out there and just be me, uh, you know, reading the, the, the comedy news. 
[02:37:00]  It was not, it was not my thing.  Um, and, and the ones who, who have done it since have done a much better, better job than  I have.  Wasn't Lawrence supposed to do that?  I heard that that was originally going to be his, but he got a little, little stage fright  or he just decided, is that true?  Or is that just maybe it could be, could be.  I mean, you know, he, uh, he did like appearing on camera at the CBC, you know, but, uh, his,  his strength is behind the scenes and, uh, and picking every week what's going to be on  the show.  That's, that's the greatest job in show business is that he's the one that ultimately decides  what works, what doesn't between dress and air, what's going to go on and what isn't. 
[02:37:30]  Those most famous on camera was making that offer to the Beatles, which was hilarious.  Yeah.  He had the, the long hair and you look at him back then and look at him now at the suit and  gray hair and balding and everything.  It's not even like it's the same person.  Well, it really is amazing.  Many of us have changed.  I didn't do that.  Uh, my look, uh, you've lost a lot of weight.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I'm still a bouncer size, you know, but, uh, yeah, it, it goes back, it goes back and forth, 
[02:38:00]  you know, and appetites and all that.  But, uh, you know, uh, can I ask you an acting question?  Uh, what do you do with your hands?  I always have trouble when I act with my hand.  I never know what to do with my fucking hands when I'm acting.  Like, where do you put them?  It's so, it's so true.  You're right about that.  Yeah.  Uh, I, I usually.  On the coffee to bring to the staff.  Yeah, exactly.  I should put them on a pistol to put them in my chin.  Uh, it's, uh, it, it, it, you know, the director will help you with that.  And also the continuity girl, the script girl will help you say, oh, you held it a certain 
[02:38:30]  way.  The cup was here or the cigarette was there or you put your hand there.  You had your right hand up.  So they can, they tell you from take to take sometimes what, what to do.  Um, the more of them, the trouble I was having was rushing the lines, was rushing  through it, rushing through it.  I, you know, we're going to be here all day and, you know, don't rush.  You can take your time, you know, and, and also I learned, you know, uh, being on camera  that this is your moment.  Once that camera's rolling, take your time.  It's all right.  It's, it's kind of like Wyatt Earp, uh, when he talked about, uh, gun fighting, he said, 
[02:39:00]  uh, I always take my time.  And that's why I always get the other guy because the other guy's nervous, adrenaline's  there.  He's rushing for the piece.  And, uh, Wyatt Earp said that, you know, I, I have my muscular musculature trained and  I take it slow.  I always take it slow.  He says, you know, he used to talk about how he would freeze that moment when he went  for the gun so that the other guy's going for the gun fast, but he's going for it slow.  And by the time that the barrel came out of the bullets already out and into the guy's 
[02:39:30]  stomach and all done in a very slow motion kind of way where time seems to stop.  So in, in motion picture acting, uh, when you're, when the camera's rolling, you know,  just take the time, it's like a car accident, how it unfolds slowly, you know, just take your  time.  And then, you know, if it doesn't work, you're back to, uh, another take at SNL.  No deal.  You're live and, uh, no taking your time there.  You rip through it.  The worst is when I would do an audition slow and feel like I really was emotionally right. 
[02:40:00]  I do it.  I'm like, that's great.  And they're like, all right, we do it again, but you got to pick up the pace.  You thought you were being brilliant.  Oh yeah.  I'm doing this with my hands flopping them out.  Well, that's why they have directors.  Oh shit.  Poor Jimmy.  Very good.  Crystal had, uh, vodka.  Yes.  We made sure that we get the word out.  And you can follow, uh, Dan Aykroyd on, uh, Twitter.  It's, uh, at Dan Aykroyd, but there is a, the underscore in between Dan and Aykroyd.  Who's got Dan Aykroyd?  I guess we do.  I don't know.  I, well, you have the underscore. 
[02:40:30]  Uh.  Someone has the other one.  Uh, I think.  Someone has the one that's easier to fucking know.  Well, I think, I think, uh, one of the companies probably has, we've probably locked it up.  Because they don't let you, uh, you know, you can't have someone else's name.  Yeah, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Unless that's actually their real name, too.  It wouldn't matter at all.  There are some Aykroyds around.  Not many, but there might, there might be another one out there.  I don't doubt it.  I don't doubt it.  Dan Aykroyd's yogurt shop somewhere, and some guy's like, no, he's not getting it.  Screw him.  There was a Jim Norton Toyota.  I was so angry.  Some guy in Tulsa, Oklahoma had a Toyota dealership with my name. 
[02:41:00]  And he was getting more fucking news and Google hits than I am.  I did flop.  Um, so Crystal Head, uh, the Rolling Stones edition, I guess, how can people get that?  That package is amazing.  It really is unbelievable.  It's, uh, going to be in retail stores all over the country.  And, um, I encourage people to, to buy it, put it up, but crack the bottle and try the  quadruple gold metal fluid.  You know, that's the, that's the, uh, that's why we're here.  It's a very, very good, uh, vodka.  I love it.  And, uh, yeah, and the bottle looks great up on the, your, your shelf, uh, behind the 
[02:41:30]  bar.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, it looks great on, on bars and, and, uh, you know, all in hotels and in, in, in restaurants  and, and in nightclubs.  It's just, what it does, it draws the attention to the bar and it's just a nice, uh, a nice  addition to it.  It's, uh, I call her, I call her Joy.  Her name is Joy.  I don't doubt it.  Yeah, uh, she's got a little smile there.  She's not a, not a mean skull at all.  That's adorable.  Yeah.  And then the top, uh, is, uh, there you'll see, uh, there's a deer head, a crescent and 
[02:42:00]  two fleur de lis.  Uh, the deer head is from the Aykroyd family crest.  The crescent is New Orleans and the other, uh, fleur de lis is the province of Quebec.  And the other fleur de lis is the state of Louisiana.  So, wow.  We, uh, we love Louisiana.  We love Quebec.  We love, uh, Franco-Americans and Franco-Canadians.  Dan Aykroyd, uh, what a pleasure having you here, man.  Thanks so much.  You guys are great.  Thanks a lot, man.  We're, uh, coming in.  Have a good weekend.  Right back with, uh, Dre DiMatteo.  The Opie Anthony Show continues in moments. 
[02:42:30]  And now, these messages.  Now, the Opie Anthony Show continues.  How great was Dan Aykroyd?  Very nice.  Real nice guy, man.  He really is.  Holy shit.  I was actually interested listening to him talk about the vodka.  Like, I didn't feel like I was being sold some bullshit.  And I don't drink.  And I was telling these guys, I was actually like, God damn, I want to try this vodka. 
[02:43:00]  That's, uh...  I probably shouldn't.  Yeah, please don't.  You probably shouldn't, Jim.  Can I have a silver sharpie, Travis, and a kiss on my asshole?  You've gave us a hint of what you would be like drunk, and I don't know if we want to  see that, Jim.  No, no.  I don't, um...  I don't think you should, Jimmy.  I might.  No, no.  I'm actually debating it.  No, don't...  How many years sober?  26.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Imagine blowing that.  Fast forward.  Dan Aykroyd got me back into this. 
[02:43:30]  Thank God for Dan.  Imagine that.  That's like, what, 87?  He did...  February 1st of 87.  All of 87.  Wow, that's unbelievable.  And he did sign your bottle, Enjoy.  I saw that he wrote Enjoy on your bottle.  What, um...  Give me, like, the top fucking three songs from 1987.  I gotta put myself...  Oh, it's you too, Joshua Tree.  Is it?  Almost definitely.  I gotta put myself in the fucking mindset of how much of a fuck-up that would be. 
[02:44:00]  Because, uh...  Joshua Tree.  That much time has gone by.  Joshua Tree.  I'm trying to think what else.  I mean, you gotta go...  But I wasn't a big U2 fan back then.  You gotta go with, uh, New Wave in general.  Yeah?  Yeah, like, uh...  I don't know.  That might be, like, Wang Chung.  Wang Chung?  That might be some Wang Chung.  Everybody have fun tonight.  Give me some songs from 87.  That's a long fucking time.  Walk like an Egyptian.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Wow. 
[02:44:30]  And then you would just throw that away.  How about we keep your bottle?  How about you pour out your bottle right now?  No, I think I'm gonna have some.  I'm gonna have some.  Why?  Because he made it sound so good, right?  Yeah, I'm gonna try just one glass of it.  Cool glass of vodka.  Just one glass, huh?  How bad would it be?  Jimmy, what would the odds be that you only had one drink?  I don't even know if you're supposed to joke about this shit. 
[02:45:00]  I never know.  Sure, I started.  Yeah, so the odds are that I would have one drink?  Not good.  You know what?  At first, maybe I would do one.  Maybe just one or whatever.  Once you go over the line, though, it's like, well, look, I did it.  It's like, I was able to just have one.  And I blew 26 years, so the next ant party is when it would probably come off.  Yeah, that would be terrible.  Oh, boy.  Because then at that point, you're like, ah, I've been sober a week.  What the hell?  I'd be funny.  I'll start my sobriety next week.  That would be so bad.  I would be like, oh, my God, this guy's fucked up. 
[02:45:30]  He's going into it.  I would just sit on your sofa.  Hey, Jim.  Jimmy.  You guys make a lot more fucking money than I do.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy, be cool, man.  It's like, you were supposed to fucking look out for me.  Everyone's having fun, Jim.  It's a party.  Be cool.  Where's your fucking guards?  No, no.  They're in the closet.  They're fucking locked up in the safe in the closet.  Don't fucking. 
[02:46:00]  He'd be looking for my gun.  Give me that.  I just want to fucking hold it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, would that be horrible?  Oh, it would be bad.  I don't want that at all.  I don't even know if this is funny.  It is.  No, I know it's funny.  It's silly.  Oh, this is another 87, huh?  You think Aykroyd has a few bucks?  Yeah.  From the vodka?  From the movies, from everything, sure.  Beautiful packaging, this crystal head vodka.  It's genius.  Holy fuck.  I like that shit. 
[02:46:30]  Is it really that much better at it?  Yeah, it's very good.  I'm not even kidding.  It really is good.  And what does it taste like?  It tastes like vodka, but not like, like, like he said, some vodka tastes perfumey.  Like they try to mask, like vodka chilled, the little vermouth and some olives in there,  a martini, you know, is pretty good.  I like it mixed, though.  I'm not a pure vodka guy.  Anyway, I'll do some shots, but I like it with the, you know, a little OJ, a little cranberry, 
[02:47:00]  something like that, and maybe a little cranberry.  You know, I'm a fucking pussy when it comes to a vodka drinks.  I don't like it straight, you know?  Yeah.  I like a shot, but, you know.  I haven't fucking had a drink in a long time.  It's got to be two days now.  It's probably since, I guess, Saturday.  You get the shakes?  Yeah, look at me.  Well, now it's a few days.  No, not really.  I'm steady as a rock, I know.  I'm kidding.  How about that first day? 
[02:47:30]  The amount of drinking you do, though, you would think you would start shaking.  Nah.  I'm good.  You are good, man.  Not a shake to you.  Why don't you just stay the course now?  Should I?  Yeah.  No.  Give it 90 days.  No.  If you don't like it, you can always.  90 days?  Give it three months.  90 days.  Fuck.  That's not that long.  That's the whole summer.  Can we take 90 days off?  That would be a nightmare.  What are we in now?  April?  Picture the first fucking.  Not by the end of July.  June, July.  Picture the first fucking 20 minutes of today's show all the time. 
[02:48:00]  No.  I don't get nasty.  I really don't.  I'm nasty anyway.  And when I'm hungover, I'm really fucking not fun to be around.  I'm really not fun to be around.  So, uh...  Well, speaking of being drunk, we got an E-Rock bit.  What?  And are we doing the move thing for the $500?  HBO was nice enough to give us $500.  We really should.  I mean, we're supposed to.  You want to just do sometime tomorrow, you're going to hear E-Rock booing, and you call in 
[02:48:30]  and get the $500?  Yeah, I guess.  I just...  I wish he would pump up the contest for us, but he's made it very clear he will not.  He's really not a team player.  No, he isn't.  Did you like Dan Aykroyd, E-Rock?  Yeah, it was great.  I mean, he's a legend.  He's sitting there like just a regular guy.  Yeah, talking about his vodka.  Maybe E-Rock should sing the fucking Louis theme song, but instead of Louis, he should sing  Mooey, Mooey, Mooey, Mooey, Mooey.  Yeah, can you do that?  Mooey, Mooey, Mooey, Mooey, Mooey, Mooey. 
[02:49:00]  That's not a bad idea.  Why don't you sing Mooey, Mooey?  That's a great idea.  Yeah, because it ties in with Louis.  Right.  And your obesity.  Would you do Mooey, Mooey, Mooey, Mooey?  Would you do that?  Or make believe we're not talking.  Oh!  There we go.  All right, bring him into Troy's studio.  I want to hear how it comes out before the end of the show.  Yeah.  Any time he says, Louis, you say Mooey. 
[02:49:30]  It's easy.  The hook.  Yeah.  And then when you hear that tomorrow, just call and we'll give you $500.  Thanks to HBO.  Yeah.  And Louis C.K.'s great special that's going down Saturday night.  That song, Louis, is about what they call an oil derrick.  No, really?  He's a racist in the racist community.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oil derrick.  They call him oil.  It's a white guy that fucks a black chick.  Really?  Yeah, they call him an oil derrick.  But what's Louis about?  How's Louis about that?  Because she was black as the night.  Louis was whiter than white. 
[02:50:00]  Oh.  There's a danger when you taste brown sugar.  And he goes and tells his father.  And his father's like pissed off.  Calls him fucking pissy eyes.  And goes, son of a bitch.  Can we hear the song now?  I never knew this.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought it was a nice song.  Nah, it's about a little taboo interracial love.  Sally, can you find that?  William Derrick.  Yeah, and by the way, the other way around, it's called A Coal Burner.  There we go. 
[02:50:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  Oh, man.  Nice effect.  Ah, but he fell in love.  I feel like I'm watching a movie. 
[02:51:00]  It's a cool song.  It's going to go.  Mooey, mooey, mooey. 
[02:51:30]  Mooey.  Mooey, mooey, you're going to cry.  All right, you can fade out right there, Sal.  Yeah, it's a little interracial love song.  Very good.  Sal was laughing at it.  He can't wait to hear it.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  That's the part I want to hear him sing.  Yeah, which is going to be.  It goes real fast.  We'll have it in a minute or two, hopefully.  It's being recorded now.  So we got the drunk E-Rock bit.  Yeah, a very special episode of the Opie and Anthony show.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, 
[02:52:00]  the sex bagel battles his demons.  Everything could be saved if you come in and take a shot.  When he throws a celebration for himself.  Tequila day was my idea.  But when things go wrong, E-Rock gets personal.  I can come with a woman, you can't.  And the things that usually help no longer do the trick.  Maybe I need a donut.  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife. 
[02:52:30]  I didn't grab her tits, though.  I don't think she's proud of this particular show.  Then, insulting his radio idol.  Oh, turn it off.  Give your final sign-off.  Go home.  No one needs you.  E-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain.  9-0-8-8-  Try it again.  9-0-8, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling.  And awful cliches are used improperly.  A lot to go home.  We may get the truth. 
[02:53:00]  And I know, I know that he doesn't like me.  But when humiliation sets in, the sex man's emotions become out of control.  I don't even know that I'm crying.  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way.  Next week, on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Morning, BJs.  Jesus.  That's so embarrassing.  Oh, fuck.  Is that embarrassing? 
[02:53:30]  One for the ages right there.  Oh, man.  He was fucking hammered.  Yep.  It really was.  It was fun.  Really drunk.  Today, we also referenced Jimmy doing regular Joe on Red Eye.  Guess what?  Through the magic of radio, we got it right here for everybody.  This is how it went down on Fox yesterday.  I think it obstructs my view to see this instead of the show.  Yeah.  So it bugs me.  And now that you have the iPads out, it's like this.  All I see is a huge square. 
[02:54:00]  The picture.  People take pictures with iPads.  They do it all the time.  They do it all the time.  I like it because then you're looking at it.  It seems closer.  If you're behind them, I just look at the iPad and I forget where I am.  And you just see a sea of iPads, though.  Yeah, but it's like really cool.  I just want to be a regular Joe.  Ah, iPads.  You get me just a throwaway camera.  What the hell do I know?  Give me a container of coffee.  A container of coffee.  I know those annoying old guys.  What?  You know those guys.  Ah, your iPad. 
[02:54:30]  What the hell do you need that for?  Get to work on time.  Thank you.  Get to work on time.  Yeah.  Ah, what the hell do I know?  I can't stop doing regular Joe and Edgar.  I don't like regular Joe.  What the hell do I know?  Regular Jay.  Jerry.  You do Edgar at home?  Oh, yeah, of course.  To myself.  It's fantastic.  You should have went to WrestleMania.  You would have really enjoyed this. 
[02:55:00]  I've been to some Edgar.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've had Edgar at my house.  What do you say to yourself as Edgar?  I just say words like in names.  Like if there's a...  Like if the name fucking...  Like Richard Lewis is on TV.  I'll be like, Richard Lewis.  It's not his name.  But I have to say all the names and words like that.  Like Edgar.  Like this would be...  Crystal Heat Vote Gay. 
[02:55:30]  No, it's not.  It's Crystal Heat.  Heat.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  It's Crystal Heat.  Someone put...  Someone put mountain rocks in your vodka.  Apple fools.  He doesn't give you enough time to even acknowledge his Apple fools joke. 
[02:56:00]  It's the 11th.  It's the 11th.  It's the 12th Apple Files.  And then he just tells you to shut up.  Oh, Christ.  We also have Uncle Paul writing a poem.  Yeah, I don't know about this one.  I haven't heard it.  Who did this one?  I have no idea.  I just saw it in front of you.  Uh-oh.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul. 
[02:56:30]  With the creepy old guy staring at Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul writes a poem.  You're like my sunshine.  You're like a can of warm sardine oil pouring down my throat.  You're like Sav. 
[02:57:00]  I love on my privates when they're all chafed from running around.  I want to be your preparation, H.  Always getting in there and making you feel better.  My tongue is your toilet paper.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring at Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall. 
[02:57:30]  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Fuck it, Steve.  What an amazing jingle.  Good job, Steve.  He's gone.  There's nothing we can throw about it.  Couldn't be helped.  Couldn't be helped.  I hear tell his monument that has been erected.  His, as they call it, a gravestone.  Is indeed embossed with the Foundry Music logo. 
[02:58:00]  Is it really?  Yes.  It has the watermark.  Yes, it's watermarked.  Really?  For all eternity.  It's no shit.  That's funny.  I've seen pictures of it, and it does indeed have the Foundry Music logo that we've found  on every single video we ever had.  He owned us.  Steve owned us for a while.  And he gets the last laugh.  Good for Steve.  Yeah.  Do we have the move thing?  It's being worked on. 
[02:58:30]  Where am I?  Where did I go?  I was somebody walking the earth.  Now I'm not.  Where am I, everybody?  What a ghost he'd be.  I know.  It's terrible.  I don't like this music.  I don't like the music either, E-Rock.  Why?  I don't like it.  It's too creepy.  He's scared.  It doesn't make it fun.  Like, I have fun when I do Ghostly Steve, and then you play this music, it just stops  the whole thing dead in its tracks.  Literally.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  He's been told. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  But he keeps playing it.  He's a rebel.  He's doing his own bits, I guess.  Yeah, what bit are you doing in there, ghost boy?  Oh.  You won't do the moo bit, but...  Yeah, you won't do the moo bit, but you're a ghost in all over town.  The only other thing we got, I want to do the moo thing, but Kobe Bryant tells Jim  Rome he would have smacked the Rutgers coach.  Oh, wait.  That's how you know that guy was out of line, because a lot of players are not sticking up  for him. 
[02:59:30]  LeBron James spoke up.  Kobe Bryant spoke up.  I would imagine they had some tough coaches, but obviously, this guy went a little far.  The two best guys in the NBA are both saying he was a fucking dick.  Yeah.  For doing that.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Isn't one a rapist?  Thank you.  What the fuck is that guy saying anything?  Yeah, but that doesn't mean that everything he says is right.  He's not officially a rapist.  No?  What happened?  Accused.  He was accused of rape.  Mm-hmm.  He did fess up to fucking her in the ass, though, right?  He's a good guy. 
[03:00:00]  What would you do?  Yeah, that's just...  Fuck her in the ass.  That's just saying hello.  It's a fine, how do you do...  That's a...  Hey, what's up?  It's a fine, how do you do-do.  How do you do-do with great difficulty?  From my stomach.  That's how a dude bro says hi.  Right?  Yeah, of course.  That's how a dude bro says hi.  Oh, shit.  That wouldn't be swoot.  That would be...  Sweet!  Oh, God.  You don't like that?  No.  It's so stupid. 
[03:00:30]  It's so stupid.  It's not stupid.  If I like something, that's how I do it.  You're just jealous that you haven't come up with fucking saying no.  If you see a pretty girl, what do you think of her?  Sweet!  That's right.  If some guy ever said that, like, look at her, man.  I'd be like, oh, yeah.  Sweet!  Hi.  Sweet!  Sweet!  We should play that whenever we like something on the show.  Like, that'll be the sound clip.  Like, hey, man.  Looks like I'm going to upgrade to first class.  Sweet!  Sweet!  I would hope we would play the sound effect. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, I was...  Somebody wasn't in there lollygagging.  Lollipopping.  It's just...  It's a non-stop cavalcade.  It's a cornucopia.  Exactly.  A cornumopia.  A cornudopia.  A creamed cornucopia. 
[03:01:30]  Can you tell we're finishing up here?  Got eight minutes.  Go home.  We just want to play the move bit and go home.  That's it.  You should tell Troy to hurry up.  Hurry up.  Do you want to hear Kobe Bryant or not?  I don't know.  Yeah, let's hear how obnoxious he sounds.  After the video of Mike Rice surfaced, you tweeted,  that's not coaching.  That's a power trip. 
[03:02:00]  Coach, don't bully.  If you were one of the players getting the ball thrown at them,  how would you have reacted?  I would have smacked the hell out of him.  Yeah, sure.  No question about it.  No question about it.  Yeah, sure.  It probably wouldn't have been the best way to react to it,  but that's how I would have reacted to it.  So why do you think none of those guys did?  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  I think everybody was trying to do the right thing by kind of just holding your tongue  and not saying anything.  I mean, that's abusive, man. 
[03:02:30]  You can't take that form of abuse.  That's crazy.  My parents didn't do nothing like that to me.  I mean, one last thought about that.  I mean, you didn't go to college, but even at 18, when you were 18,  an 18-year-old Kobe Bryant, would you have smacked the hell out of him at that age?  Oh, no question.  Like I said, just a year later, I was going at it with Shaq.  You think I'm going to let a coach throw a ball at my head?  Not a chance.  There you go.  Not a chance.  Well, the only people that had the license to hit me was my mom with a belt.  That was it. 
[03:03:00]  Did she ever do that?  Yeah, yeah, she did that.  Fair enough.  Wow.  Fair enough.  That's a fair call.  I don't think so, though.  At 18.  What?  If he was in...  Because if some guy threw a basketball at his head when he was not in college  and just, what, on one of the fucking courts out in the hood,  he would have fucking beat the shit out of someone.  Yeah.  He went right to the NBA.  Right.  But if, like, he had a coach that was throwing fucking shit in his head? 
[03:03:30]  Well, the two guys that are coming out saying they would have beat the shit out of the coach, basically.  That's what they're basically saying.  They're trying to keep it nice, whatever.  Didn't go to college.  Right.  So they weren't in these college programs.  Just think Bobby Knight.  I guarantee Bobby Knight threw balls at players' heads.  I guarantee it.  Guaranteed.  But they just weren't taping.  Yeah.  And I guarantee he used some fucking shitty language, too.  Yep.  We actually got tapes of those.  So it's interesting that the only two players that have really come out are guys that never went into the college program. 
[03:04:00]  I'll bust his head.  That's true.  I'm going to bust his head.  But with that said, you know, it's tough to defend the Rutgers guy.  But there is a...  I'll say it again.  There is a culture when you play, you know, a sport in college.  Yep.  E-Roc's boo is ready.  So don't call now.  But HBO was nice enough to give us $500 to give away for the big Louis special, Oh My God, which is Saturday at 10 o'clock. 
[03:04:30]  HBO.  And when you hear this sometime tomorrow, just call and we're going to give you $500.  All right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  She was black as the night. 
[03:05:00]  No, he was whiter than white.  Danger, danger when you taste brown sugar.  Blue and fell in love overnight.  Nothing bad.  Nothing bad.  It was good.  Louie had the best girl he could.  When he took her home to meet his mama and papa, Louie knew just where it stood. 
[03:05:30]  Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, you're going to cry.  I don't like it.  It stinks.  Yeah, Jimmy's shaking his head, too.  You know why he's really trying. 
[03:06:00]  First of all, it's the whole song.  Yeah.  And I don't need the fucking eight minute intro.  I just want to cut to fucking him with the music singing.  Louie, Louie, Louie.  Right.  Not over the lyrics.  No.  Just like a cow.  Sing like a cow.  Yeah.  He's trying to sound like the song.  It shouldn't say you're going to cry.  It should say like who.  Eat a pizza pie.  Yeah, give me some pie.  Exactly.  Look at sauce in your eye. 
[03:06:30]  You're a fat guy.  Y-Rock, how do you feel it came out?  Have a piece of pie.  Does Y-Rock like it?  I gave you what you asked for.  No, you didn't.  Not really.  Exactly.  Yeah, you did.  Besides my French fry.  He said, sing the hook with the movie.  That's what I did.  He said you guys wanted the whole verse.  Sorry.  He said you guys wanted the whole verse.  Who said that? 
[03:07:00]  Eric.  Because that's what he said.  No.  He said you wanted the first verse going into the chorus.  What?  It was a little long, you know.  I agree.  Before the payoff.  And the payoff was like you rock karaoke.  Yeah.  It should just be like a cow.  It should just be the intro.  Mooey, mooey.  It should be, you know, he should just be talking it, really.  Now would you put all the production in, Y-Rock?  Yeah, we don't need the song.  Here's what we need.  Mooey, mooey, mooey.  Mooey.  Mooey.  Yeah, that's it. 
[03:07:30]  All right, get back in there.  Let's go.  Like, mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  I'm a big fucking fat fucking guy.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  I'm a big fucking fat fucking guy.  Or maybe you could just sing, mooey, mooey. 
[03:08:00]  I'm a fucking cow and I got otters you should pinch.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  O.P. .  Yeah, I just like that song. 
[03:08:30]  That was the first.  What?  That I actually had to fill for the after show.  Letting it run. 
[03:09:00]  I'm a star.  You have to understand something.  When a professional broadcaster is ready to go on, a professional broadcaster will go on.  I professionally broadcast when I'm good and fit to.  I thought you pulled their trick of, hey, you're coming back on.  Oh, I need to go to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Can you get a little time to pee?  I didn't eat my oatmeal yet.  No, not here.  Not on After Opie and Anthony Live.  It is so crazy to be out in the hallway and see Dan Aykroyd just hanging out by himself, going from studio to studio with a gym bag full of vodka bottles. 
[03:09:30]  It's the weirdest thing in the world.  Yeah, well, he's going from studio to studio here.  And, you know, he's kind of doing the Sirius XM tour, I guess.  I think Rowling got him in to do O&A.  And then one of the other talent bookers, Spencer, picked up on it and said, hey, we got some other shows if you want to do them.  And he's like, fuck yeah.  I'm trying to move some vodka today.  This might be the way to get Danny DeVito on the show.  Does he have alcohol, too?  He has a limoncello.  What's a limoncello? 
[03:10:00]  I guess it's like a lemon liqueur.  I thought it was like a tiny yellow violin.  And, um, no.  You get it, Sal?  He's supposed to do that in the chip voice.  Thanks, buddy.  Go on.  He goes around like the local news stuff and just brings it, and that's how he does appearances.  Well, yeah, let's get him in here to promote some booze.  Rowling should do a booze show, like he does the food show, and just have A-list booze people in here.  Well, Rowling also has that contact to George Clooney for his tequila.  Yeah, let's get George Clooney in to talk about tequila, and Dan Aykroyd to talk about vodka, and Danny DeVito to talk about lemons. 
[03:10:30]  The Clooney vodka that he does?  Yes, Sal?  Very smooth.  Oh, sorry, tequila.  Very smooth.  It is.  Good callback.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's a little shot at E-Rock.  Did you like the E-Rock bit today?  I didn't hear it.  I was in the studio.  Oh, do you have it?  Give it to me.  I want, I want, uh, thanks, buddy.  I want, uh, I want you to hear this.  We put this together. 
[03:11:00]  It's an ode to, oh, that's E-Rock's moos.  Are you putting together a new moo song for tomorrow?  Yeah, once, uh, once we're done with all this, I'm gonna go record.  You prefer doing this song to just announcing I'm the big, fat, fuck, lazy cow, or whatever it was that they had asked?  Yeah, I'm not helping with that.  No, you're not gonna do that.  No.  Good for you.  Stand up for yourself.  It's about time.  Um, here's the, uh, on a special episode of Opie and Anthony E-Rock production that we put together.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, the sex bagel battles his demons. 
[03:11:30]  Everything could be, everything could be saved if you come in and take a shot.  When he throws a celebration for himself.  Tequila day was my idea.  But when things go wrong, E-Rock gets personal.  I can come with a woman, you can.  And the things that usually help no longer do the trick.  Um, maybe I need a donut.  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife.  I didn't grab her tits, no.  I don't think she's proud of this, of this particular show. 
[03:12:00]  Then, insulting his radio idol.  Oh, turn it off.  Give your final sign off.  Go home, no one needs ya.  He-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain.  9-0-8, 8-  Try it again.  9-0-8, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling, here's hooked on a feeling.  And awful cliches are used improperly.  A lot to go home.  We may get the truth.  And I know, I know, that he doesn't like me. 
[03:12:30]  But when humiliation sets in, the sex man's emotions become out of control.  I don't even know that I'm crying.  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way.  Next week, on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Morning BJs.  What do you think?  Alright, that's a little difficult to listen to.  Is it?  Yeah, there's...  Look, even though it's out of context, it's not really out of context. 
[03:13:00]  That's the problem.  It's not like we took audio of you goofing around and made it seem like you might be drunk.  You got super fucked up on tequila and said all that shit.  That I did.  We just kind of packaged it together.  I think the time check was the worst.  It went 9.08, 8 minutes after 8.  7 o'clock.  Who's calling?  Got a little choked up there at the end.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  What, at the morning BJs part?  No, a lot of pure emotion coming out there.  I thought so, too.  Who's calling you, Eric?  Who's on the...  Hold on.  Who is it?  Who do you think it is? 
[03:13:30]  Hmm.  There's going to be a comic from it.  Are you a guest today?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Alright, then your guest is here.  Okay.  That was up front.  Mike Resign?  Resign?  Is that what it is?  Resign?  I think that's what you just said.  Thank God you said that because I had no idea how to pronounce it.  Yeah, I never know when you have guest book.  Roland just kind of brings people and said, hey, here you go.  You don't have to leave Alan Thicke Jr.  Alan Thicke Jr. is in here.  He really wants to...  Remember, you know how, like, for two weeks...  Just tell Roland to go to the lobby.  Oh. 
[03:14:00]  Could you run and grab Mike Resigni in the lobby?  No.  No, you're not going to do that?  You refuse.  You refuse.  I learned from him.  No, my job.  Semi-title, sir.  That's not what I do.  We've got to go get him.  I mean, somebody's got Greg Charles is out there with him.  What do you mean it's not your title?  What's your title?  Producer.  Yeah, but what's your responsibility?  Is that you book the guests?  Eh, let's change my title.  Just go get the fucking guests.  Get the fuck out of here.  Alan Thicke Jr. is in here.  He's been trying to present his bit for, like, how long? 
[03:14:30]  Uh, since...  Beginning of February.  About a weekend.  Has it been that long?  It's been that long.  Two months?  I was going to say, like, a couple weeks.  Nah, nah.  Well, I mean, it's eight weeks, so...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, we'll probably get to it tonight.  5-0-8.  You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  5-0-8.  Hey.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  I was wondering if you guys have those Opie and Anthony mixtapes in.  The T-Nuts Volume 1.  I don't know.  I haven't seen Who Kid yet, but he did post... 
[03:15:00]  I got to talk...  Hopefully, Who Kid's stopping by today, because there's a couple things that he posted on social  media that I want to talk to him about.  The first is he posted pictures of the Opie and Anthony show mixtape.  If we have them, call back, because I'll hopefully be able to give them out.  The other thing, he posted pictures of Sal playing basketball with some high school kids  and not doing well.  Apparently, there's video, too.  Yeah, so I would really like to talk to him about that.  Who's on the hotline?  He just looked like a little bitch.  I'll find out.  Hotline! 
[03:15:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How are you, Kenny?  Good.  Did she actually leave his keys up there?  I just took care of it, Kenny.  Whoa.  No, we didn't know if they were there.  I wasn't sure if I left them home.  Yeah, they're up here.  They're being run down to you right now.  Are we on the air?  Yes.  Nice.  Yes.  You left your keys up here, but I don't know.  This is the thing that drives me nuts about E-Rock.  I guess he saw the keys, and he secretly took them, and then he had them run downstairs. 
[03:16:00]  No, I didn't.  Kenny had called me, told me that they were there.  Could you have somebody run down?  So that's what I did.  But you should have been like...  Hey, he probably took the keys, because he thought I opened the fucking refrigerator.  Good.  What?  I don't...  Huh?  Terrible.  He should have tried to give them away or something.  After you were humiliated, you would think that you would try to return the favor.  I did think about it, but... 
[03:16:30]  But then you decided not to.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Your keys are on their way.  Yeah.  Here he comes with the keys.  Who's bringing them down?  I sent David down.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Did you enjoy the show today, everybody?  Thank you.  It was terrific.  Good.  Good.  It was so much fun.  Good.  You can hang up now.  All right.  I'll talk to you...  Hey, Sam.  Yeah, Kenny.  Yeah.  Are you talking about Kenny Hunt's pedicure injury?  No, you were telling me about this in the hallway, but there was no details to what  you were saying other than Jenny Hunt, who hosts his show on Starz, got a pedicure 
[03:17:00]  injury.  Well, do your own investigating.  He gave you a lead.  Yeah, I give you the headline.  Yeah, but the only thing is I did a little investigating and then discovered nobody gives  a fuck.  Oh, you did that?  Yeah.  That's not true, Sam.  No?  You're being rude now.  I don't mean to be rude.  I apologize for that.  It was a very good lead.  You think so?  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  And don't forget, today is Elevator Show Day.  What's going on in the Elevator Show?  Jose played guitar.  Jose's playing guitar in the elevator?  Yeah, man.  That's pretty good.  What is it?  Elevator Show becoming like a musical thing?  No, I'm just going through my musical period.  Oh, I see.  Next week, we're going to do something abusive with E-Rock.  Oh, great.  E-Rock, are you excited?  He just doesn't know it yet.  Oh.  Well, luckily, he wasn't listening just now, so he still doesn't know it. 
[03:18:00]  I'm not.  Yeah, whatever.  He's coming up with the hot wax carpet.  Oh, in the elevator.  Yes.  You know, we could do something like that on the radio show.  Well, I guess.  It's been done already.  Yeah, exactly.  It's never been done in an elevator.  So, you're just going to do it on the elevator show, then?  Yes, of course.  Well, the elevator show is up on what?  What's the plug for it, officially?  Where do you want to send people?  It's not up there yet.  Oh, so then what are we plugging? 
[03:18:30]  Well, it's going to be, it's up, but it's not up, because E-Bomb's World gets a big plug  at like 4 o'clock today.  Oh, so check E-Bomb's World at 4 o'clock?  Officially, even though it might be up somewhere else right now, but I'm not, you know, I don't  come up that part of it.  You don't like that.  The underground people can find it.  Yes.  I understand.  Okay.  Exactly.  All right.  Sam, you want a big announcement for your listeners? 
[03:19:00]  I would love a big announcement, Kenny.  Yes.  The Club Soda Kenny page on Facebook is close to 9,000 likes.  9,000 likes?  That's amazing.  Yeah, pretty soon 9,000.  So, you check your numbers, Kenny?  Well, I read.  Kenny checks his numbers just like I do.  Yeah, the numbers thing is, how often are you checking your numbers?  Because you've been saying that a lot lately, and it seems a little like, I don't know,  what are you doing?  Sitting at home checking numbers?  Like, aren't you above that? 
[03:19:30]  But wait until you have kids and you can't leave your house for days on end.  That's all you have left.  My next milestone is going to be 20,000 Instagram followers.  That's your goal?  That's what you're looking towards?  No, that's my next milestone as far as checking my numbers.  Oh.  You want to know a secret?  I love secrets, Kenny.  G.H. is playing a game on his phone as we speak.  That's a terrible, terrible secret.  I'm not interested in that.  Well, I got addicted to Candy Crush. 
[03:20:00]  Did you beat him?  It's a girl's game.  It's a girl's Facebook game, and I'm addicted to it.  You know, well, E-Rock has been playing Candy Crush.  Did you play this game because Obi's playing it?  No, I'm way ahead of him.  What level are you on?  I've been playing it for months.  What level are you on?  75.  Holy fuck.  I'm up to, I'm only up to 32, but I only started like two days ago.  Ouch.  You better keep checking those numbers.  Yeah.  I hope you're ready on Instagram.  Let's put me over 20,000 people.  Let's hit that milestone today. 
[03:20:30]  You have a radio show.  Who gives a fuck about Instagram followers?  And then I don't know what my next milestone is going to be.  I'm not really sure.  I think a million Twitter followers.  I think I'm getting close to a million there.  No, you're not.  Yeah, I am.  No, you're not getting close to a million.  You haven't, you're not at 200,000 yet.  No, I'm getting really close to a million.  Sam, it's collectively, yes.  Oh.  All right.  I have a million Twitter followers.  Oh, shut up, Edgar.  Oh, don't you think. 
[03:21:00]  I have a million.  No, you don't.  You don't need to.  Respectful.  Yes, I do.  All right.  Well, I congratulate all of you on your numbers then.  I have a million.  What?  Sam, guess what location?  Columbus Circle.  Uh-oh.  Pretty close.  Great.  Fantastic.  I would have given you $100 if you got it right.  Can I tell you something right now?  Yeah.  There's an intern, and he's been trying to pitch a bit on the air for like two months, and he's 
[03:21:30]  getting super pissed off right now that I'm spending time, because he thinks that instead  of spending time talking to the host of the show on the phone, that I should be talking  to him about his bit that he's been waiting two months to pitch to me on the air.  Oh, Alan?  Yeah, that's exactly right.  Sam, by the way, I just checked my Twitter followers, because I thought you might be right,  but no, I'm very close to a million.  Okay, well, I was wrong.  I'm mad enough to admit that.  I'm very close to a million. 
[03:22:00]  Let's do that today, too, all right?  You want to get to a million Twitter followers today?  Yeah, that'd be good.  All right.  Well, good luck, I guess.  I mean, I don't know what to tell you.  I think, I still think you're very far away, but...  Pretty close.  I'll give you $1,000 to the million Twitter followers.  How much?  $1,000 cash.  $1,000?  You could do better than that.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  $2,000.  I have six million Twitter followers.  Are you at home yet, Edgar? 
[03:22:30]  No.  Unfortunately, he lives very close to me.  I really wish he was over ready.  You're going to go to exercise.  Yeah, we are.  We're going to go see if the creeps are there.  That's good.  Usually, you've got to get...  We've got to do something.  We've got to incorporate your gym visits on the radio  as much as they've been talked about.  We do.  We talk about them.  I know, but, I mean, you've got to, I don't know,  call into the show from the locker room or something.  I want to find out if these creeps are there.  Especially that...  I wrote to him yesterday, and he didn't... 
[03:23:00]  I wrote,  At Jim, Mr. Scroller is scrolling and gazing.  And he's important to have to be back.  I was fine, but...  I thought you were doing your radio show.  That's why...  Oh, we're not...  That's why I thought it was a perfect time to write you.  Oh.  I don't check my phone when I'm on that radio show  because I'm the only one talking,  so I have to pay attention.  Because it sucks when you've got to pay attention.  Yeah.  So...  I'm not always supposed to be king.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Are we done here? 
[03:23:30]  Are we finished?  No.  No, I think the listeners are really enjoying this.  This is...  Yeah.  This is just us, like, just being, you know, us.  You have four hours every morning.  What are you...  You're not being you on your show?  No, because that's, like,  that's a pumped-up version of our personality.  This is just us.  This is what you get.  When there's no pressure  and no microphones in front of us.  So I get, like, the shitty part  where you're not performing.  I think that's fascinating to the listeners.  I really do.  Oh.  And Edgar, too? 
[03:24:00]  Sam, I just checked the more numbers.  Oh, good.  I'm looking for clicks today  on my YouTube channel.  I'm closing in on 42 million views.  42 million views on YouTube combined.  But that's not a good milestone.  I like the, like, where it's all nice.  Like, 20,000.  Like, 100,000.  42 million is a lot more than 20,000.  Yeah, but it doesn't seem, like, nice.  Like, 20,000 Instagram followers, nice.  1 million Twitter followers, nice. 
[03:24:30]  42 is just a weird number.  I have 5 million Instagram friends.  Oh, my God.  What do you think, Alan?  Who's Alan?  Talk.  Alan, go ahead.  Talk.  Say what you feel.  Yeah, what is he?  A wrench or something?  He got you on that one, Alan.  Chip nailed you on that, dude.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  What are you thinking?  I'm just thinking that...  Hey, Sam, Sam.  Yeah, Kenny?  Yeah?  Are you going to play 
[03:25:00]  What Did You Learn Today?  No.  I mean, we passed that point in the show.  We're done with that.  You took up all the What Did You Learn time.  No, people learned.  Yeah, I understand.  But you took up all the time.  I got other things to move on to.  I got people to talk to.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I just cleared level 33 as I was talking to you.  Well, see, that makes me feel like you're not even paying attention.  Like, if you weren't my boss, I would have hung up by now.  No, I'm really good at multi-packing.  I'm your boss.  I'm your boss. 
[03:25:30]  I'm your boss because it's Shannon.  These goddamn characters.  Hey, it's Shannon, boy.  Hey, Rob, do you Facebook your Candy Crush progress?  No, I don't.  Why?  Is that what girls do?  Because nobody does that.  It's stupid.  Oh.  Do you, Opie?  Well, I want to show people off.  There's nothing wrong with showing off a little bit, letting everybody know.  I'd rather show off how good I am at Candy Crush than how good I am at doing radio. 
[03:26:00]  Well, that's pathetic.  I mean, that's horrible.  I can't believe that this has happened, that that's the point in your life that you're at.  You need to reassess a lot, if that's true.  Well, I think people just take it for granted on a bit of radio, but they don't know what a  Candy Crush is.  Well, I guess it's good.  Look, I got people to talk to.  Who kids here?  Mike Racine.  Racine.  Racine.  Mike Racine is here.  He's a very funny comic. 
[03:26:30]  Did who kid get with Rachel Feinstein?  I'll ask him.  Who kid?  Huh?  Did you fuck Rachel Feinstein?  No.  You did not.  Kenny, he didn't.  Kenny's on the phone.  Opie's on the phone.  Oh, shit.  I think I did.  You might have.  Oh, shit.  I haven't been able to give Mike his proper introduction yet, because these nincompoops have  been taking up all this phone time.  She got a nice mouth.  If Mike was funny, he would have been on our show today.  Mike is young, all right?  We try him out here. 
[03:27:00]  We, you know?  Wow.  Christy Stefano was just on the show last week.  He's hilarious.  I have a lot of faith in Mike.  Oh, my bad.  I was confused there.  All right.  We're going to the gym.  We'll call if we see any creeps.  Okay, yeah.  Call if we see any creeps.  Who kid?  This guy's on my dick, man.  Yeah, exactly.  He's my man.  Because you got a lot of Twitter followers.  That's Opie on the phone.  Oh, that was Opie?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  My bad.  I thought that was somebody else. 
[03:27:30]  I brought the mixtape for him, too.  You did?  He left.  All right.  They're gone.  Finally.  Fuck.  Mike Racine.  Racine?  Yeah.  I was trying to figure it out.  Well, because it's very...  I didn't know if it was Racine, Racine, Racine.  Racine.  It's a strong name.  It's like Italian or something, right?  What is that?  Yeah, it's Racine.  It's an Italian pronunciation.  And then you whiten it up.  You Hollywood it up.  Yeah.  My family off the boat.  Are my feet supposed to touch the ground? 
[03:28:00]  No.  We let them dangle.  It just feels weird.  Yeah.  It makes you feel like a little like I'm not sure what's going to happen next.  He's on that Kevin Hart seat.  It adds to the unpredictability.  You know DJ Who Kid, Mike?  No.  Nice to meet you.  What's up, man?  How are you?  I'm a nigga.  Good.  He's a DJ Who Kid.  He likes to use the N-word a lot.  That's why we have him on.  Okay.  We got something in common.  He's a tie.  He's a nigga, too.  We throw it around.  He doesn't use the ER.  You do?  Huh?  You do.  Only in text messages to my white friends and stuff like that. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  Hey, I saw this nigga the other day.  Do you use the A or the ER?  Probably the A-R.  The ER more.  Just the A kind of feels dishonest.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Okay, cool.  So now, hey.  Nice to be here.  No, trust me.  They're like our black white friends in the community.  You know what I'm saying?  It's the greatest possible intro.  I don't know.  Italians are some of those racist people, though.  Yeah.  But I think that's because, like, I don't know why.  It's cool racism, though.  I've seen Do the Right Thing, and it doesn't seem like the blacks and Italians are friends 
[03:29:00]  with each other.  We don't like mixing, which is weird, because that's what we are.  Yeah, I feel like you appreciate each other's culture, because little Italian kids love hip-hop.  Italian kids love rap music.  And what do black kids like?  Gangster movies.  I don't know.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't associate with them.  And you gotta add pizza, man.  And black people like pizza?  Well, we love pizza.  I heard a Japanese kid use the N-word the other day.  I was walking up 2nd Avenue, and he broke it.  Get out of here.  Yeah, and I wanted to correct him. 
[03:29:30]  He's like, maniga.  Because Italians can use it, but not Japanese kids.  Like, Asian kids.  No, Italians can't.  It's wrong when I use it.  Right.  But I do it anyway.  Because it's your culture.  But yeah, I mean, I just don't think that...  For some reason, there's a disconnect when it comes to actually associating with each other.  You appreciate each other's culture from afar.  Of course.  Maybe that's because, like, your parents would be disappointed if you brought home a black friend.  I don't know.  Not a black friend.  I mean, but they don't like interracial dating. 
[03:30:00]  Have you ever dated a black girl?  No.  Never?  I made out with our prom queen in high school.  You're a black prom queen?  Yeah.  See, look at the world we live in.  This is beautiful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like Obama, you know.  Yeah, that's ill.  He ate black tongue.  That's ill.  Would you consider it eating tongue?  Is that what you call making out?  Yeah, we just made out a little bit.  She was like, we should bone this summer.  But I was like, I got scared.  You did?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I'm a faggot.  You are?  Okay.  Okay. 
[03:30:30]  They got fat pussies.  Is that right?  Mm-hmm.  How come...  Did you get intimidated because she's a black girl?  Yeah, a little bit.  You're intimidated to...  But you made out with her.  Yeah.  So I feel like, you know...  It didn't really go...  It wasn't great?  Did you feel like you did not perform well?  No, it was good.  You know.  I mean, obviously, if she said we should...  I just never, like, followed up.  Right.  I don't know.  She said we should bone later.  We should bone...  She said we should bone this summer.  Right.  And you were like, great, I don't have any...  I don't know if she meant, like, you know, immediately or the next month. 
[03:31:00]  And then it's like July, and you're like, fuck, I should have called last month.  It's weird, man.  I fucked a lot of Italian bitches.  You fucked a lot of Italian bitches?  I've been to Italy, all over Italy.  I fucked everywhere.  You did?  I came in them and everything.  Where is it easiest to get laid for you?  Probably Venice.  Venice.  It is.  It's Italy.  It's like, I don't know.  I'm like a new pair of Jordans over there.  Do you get upset when you see Italian girls with black men?  Of course.  It's normal.  So are we talking about anything else today? 
[03:31:30]  I don't know.  This is where we're at right now.  No, I don't.  You don't.  Good.  It's weird, because I was, my family's really racist, so I grew up with, like, that, so they  were, like, my whole life, they were like, never, it's wrong, mixing, my cousin, now my  cousin's dating a Nigerian right now.  Wow.  Wow.  This guy has a fucking, yeah, this guy has an MBA from Stanford, and my family is still,  like, uncomfortable with it.  He's smarter than any dumb wop that, like, in my family.  Yeah.  He's probably the most educated person to ever come into my family. 
[03:32:00]  But they can't look past it.  Well, they're still, like, a little, they're uncomfortable about it.  That's so funny.  A Nigerian or a dude or a girl?  She's a girl, and she's dating a Nigerian guy.  Damn, big African cock.  Yeah.  That's what they're worried about, I guess.  Big African cock.  Big African cock.  Going in that daughter.  Shit.  Shit.  So you're, like, sitting there going, my brother said he had dinner with my uncle, and  he, my uncle was talking about it, and he, like, got, he got teary-eyed.  That big African cock. 
[03:32:30]  Look, I gotta talk to you about what's been going on.  It's, it's not good news.  It's not good news.  Uh, big African cock.  He's like, I wasn't there for her.  I think he said something like that.  It's like, I just wish I could have been there when it happened.  Like, it wasn't a suicide.  It was, yeah.  It's not a drug overdose.  It's, they're in love.  And she's an intelligent girl.  And she's an, and he's a smart guy.  Right.  And she's, I don't know.  But they'll, they'll get over it.  It's so funny.  So you're sitting there, like, trying to get over this sort of ingrained racism.  Uh-huh. 
[03:33:00]  When did you start to realize that your parents were racist and you didn't have to be?  Uh, well.  Because I've always wondered that.  Like, when do you, like, you get to, like, what, fifth grade and be like, oh, black  people are actually okay.  Uh, okay.  So I realized they were racist probably pretty early.  I realized I didn't have to be maybe, like, a couple months ago.  I guess.  I don't know.  Like, I think I, no, what happened was I went to college and I had a, I took a course with,  like, a, um, a professor who was really into, like, I just learned about sexism, racism, 
[03:33:30]  and, and I was like, oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.  Wow.  So it was like, it was like the reverse of dangerous minds.  It's like a, yeah.  Like some, some black professor came and showed you what it was to, to live in the hood and  everything.  And you were like, I can, I can handle this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My parents were wrong.  You know, there's one thing I've never seen.  I've never seen, like, a gay Italian.  Were they exist out there?  Yeah.  There's a couple.  But they're not, they're not supposed to be gay.  No.  One was blowing me the other night and I think. 
[03:34:00]  It's okay now.  Yeah.  No, my friend, my friend Mateo is, uh, gay.  He is?  Yeah.  Is it, how is his family with it?  Uh, I think they're cool.  They are.  I don't know.  Yeah.  How would your family be with that?  If you were like, hey, I'm gay and I'm dating a black dude.  I asked my mom the other day and I go.  Damn.  No.  I asked my mom the other day, I go, I go, uh, hey, would it be more disappointing if  I brought home a guy or a black woman?  And she goes, well, I would say a black woman. 
[03:34:30]  Your father would probably say a man.  You have no idea.  All you're doing is disappointing these people.  This is awful.  I've just never seen that.  I've just never seen, like, a gay time.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I see everybody's gay in my circle, but I've never seen it.  Everybody's gay in your circle?  I thought we're all gay.  I mean, I'm not a gay man.  Are you gay?  No.  Yeah.  Some scientists said that we all have the gay genes.  No, you've said that before.  I feel like you're...  In the nipple?  You're kind of justifying some feelings. 
[03:35:00]  Look at your nipple right now.  You see you come out.  Again, this is you requesting things and...  I don't know, kid.  Fuckin' elbow.  So, Mike.  Yeah.  Let's move on from all this nonsense.  Yes, thank you.  Why?  You're like where we're at now.  You're a comic.  How long have you been doing comedy?  Six and a half years.  Yeah.  And how old are you?  25.  Okay.  So, you've been doing it since you were...  Yeah.  I dropped out of Montclair State in Jersey to do stand-up.  Fuck college, huh?  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  What was worse for your parents? 
[03:35:30]  You being like, I'm dropping out of college to become a comedian?  Or potentially you saying, I'm dating a black girl?  Probably the black girl would be much worse.  Much, much worse.  Were they okay with you leaving college?  I don't understand.  Not at first, but after a couple years, they were cool with it.  How long does it take before you actually consider yourself, okay, I'm really a comedian?  Or are you even there yet?  Are you still just like, nah, I'm not...  I guess.  I'm not really... 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Because you're headlining Caroline's tonight at 10.  Hot.  Right.  And Norton is there tonight, too.  At 8.  At 8.  So you're doing the late night show tonight?  Yeah.  It's a pretty big deal.  Yeah.  Is it a...  Does it matter who does the show before you?  That's one of those weird things.  I'll probably run into him, and I've never met him before.  Oh, really?  I'll probably run into him in the green room and just like, you know, say something dumb.  He's a part of this.  Norton is semi-gay.  He has like gay tendencies, too, right?  I mean, he's been with transvestites before.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  Why did you say two?  I mean, not me.  I mean, you're not pointing out things you have in common with people?  No, no, no.  Okay.  No, definitely not.  All right.  I fuck bitches, man.  You do?  I'm not saying you don't, but I'm just saying...  That's how you know he fucks bitches.  I fuck bitches.  Yeah.  He makes the announcement.  You're not married, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, bud.  I don't fuck her.  I hate her.  You hate your wife?  I haven't fucked her in four years.  Right.  Yeah, we actually...  Who said...  Maybe it was E-Rock.  Somebody said...  Oh, Sal.  Because I want to talk to you about you seeing Sal, too. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, that was my little spy thing.  Sal said that he saw you with a MILF walking around.  I wasn't with no MILF.  That's a nice woman.  Sexy.  He said you were with a MILF.  No, I wasn't.  I was with a sexy woman.  No, Sal also said she seemed much older than him.  Yeah.  No?  He said very cougary.  No, she was sexy and nice.  And then Norton said, you don't want to say that about somebody, Sal, because...  Oh, there goes Sal.  This is Sal.  Oh, nice.  Hey.  And who kids saw him the other day playing basketball?  I was walking by spying. 
[03:37:30]  I was doing my Nigga Bond thing.  Is that what Nigga Bond does?  Yeah.  And...  When I was 21, I banged a 44-year-old open mic host in the bathroom of the open mic.  I don't know what...  Get the fuck out of here.  Wow.  There was a Moroccan restaurant called Tajine on 9th Avenue.  I know what you're talking about.  Holy shit.  I bent her over the toilet.  What?  I had sex with her.  And she's 44.  She was 44 at the time.  Now she's probably like 70.  Yeah, I'm not good with that.  She had a kid who was older than me. 
[03:38:00]  She had a kid?  She had two kids.  Oh, no.  I said single mom.  Did you?  No, I don't think I did.  No.  She had two kids.  One was older than me.  One was...  That was over.  Wow.  Damn.  Is that exciting when, like, you know that there's a kid who's...  Especially if they're older than you?  Like, that you could actually go up to somebody and be like, I fucked your mom.  And they'd be like, ha ha.  And you'd be like, no, seriously.  I bent her over that toilet while I was an open mic-er.  And I fucked your mom.  I guess, Sam.  But I try not to have an ego about these things.  Yeah.  Yes.  What's cool, you don't need a condom for anybody over 40. 
[03:38:30]  You don't need condoms for that.  I guess so.  It was probably menopausing, right?  Menopause?  Yeah.  Yeah, I actually think I...  Yeah, I didn't use a condom.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, it was great.  It's when you can't get pregnant anymore.  Oh.  And then I went to...  Right, Sam?  The whole reason why I thought he would say that statement is because of menopause.  But he didn't even know it.  He just thinks you can just fuck old people.  I don't know.  Yeah, done.  He's just not guilty about it.  There's no way he had time to put a condom on.  And she's 40.  No.  She's 44.  She survived the disease era. 
[03:39:00]  She's 40.  So when you say she was an open mic hoster, does that mean she was like...  Was she getting paid?  Was she a real...  No.  So she's just 44.  She just hosted the open mic, yeah.  And she's just trying to get by.  It was hot.  It was one of the saddest open mics, too, because they gave all the comics 10 minutes.  Uh-huh.  So you're watching open mic-level comedians...  For 10 minutes?  For 10 minutes a piece.  That was a high-speed comedy?  What the fuck is that?  No.  Open mic is supposed to be...  Open mics are about two...  Like, the standard in the city are like two minutes.  What?  So if you have one thing you're working on, you go up and it's, you know... 
[03:39:30]  But this one was 10.  So if you were 7th or 8th, you would just want to kill yourself.  That's fucked up.  Because when you get up there...  I'm assuming when you're doing comedy, especially in the beginning, like before you perform,  you probably think, yeah, I got 10 minutes easy right here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you get up on stage and you've got one and a half.  Sure.  And so open micers are up there for 10 minutes.  Yeah.  She's hosting them.  Yeah.  And you're like, I got 10 minutes before the next comic comes on.  I can bang this broad out in the bathroom.  No, it was after the mic ended. 
[03:40:00]  It was after it ended.  How did you pull that off?  How did you pull it off?  She would, like, flirt with me during the mic, and then I just waited for everyone to leave  one day.  Wow.  And then I went back out.  Did you just tell her we should go to the bathroom right now?  No, I think it was her idea.  And you're like, okay.  Her idea, okay.  This is making up for the black chick you never banged.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Sal, he says that he saw Who Kid with some MILF. 
[03:40:30]  And then Norton goes, you know, you shouldn't say that on the radio.  It's a nice thing.  That's my nice thing.  Well, he said because you don't know Who Kid's situation.  And I said, Jen, no.  You don't understand.  Who Kid on a daily basis announces to the world that he hates his wife and cheats on her.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, you do cheat on your wife, right?  Fuck that bitch.  Yeah, okay.  Does she know that?  Yeah, fuck her.  Look at me.  Fucking square.  Is she aware of your...  I'm Italian right now.  That's a good question.  Huh?  Huh?  I'm trying to be Italian, so fuck her. 
[03:41:00]  You know what I'm saying?  No, I don't know what you're saying.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Is that what Italians do?  So, Sal.  Yes.  You saw him with a MILF?  Yeah.  She's fucking hot.  But she was definitely...  How do you know she had kids?  I didn't...  Okay, she was an older lady.  Is she older than you?  Yeah, she's older than me.  Okay, so that's what I just naturally think, that maybe she has a kid or something.  No.  So, what did you see when you were walking around?  Explain it to me.  He was getting his ass beat by some black teenagers.  They were really young, too. 
[03:41:30]  I thought he was, like, into it.  I don't know, like...  I got video, too.  Are you getting his kicks off?  Video's hilarious, because you're actually running back and forth, like, for five, ten minutes.  Where are you going to post the video?  You've got to post it somewhere and share it with the audience.  Yeah.  I've got to post the video.  Yeah.  Nah, I don't...  Sal starts a basketball game with a bunch of little black kids.  I was waiting for Sal to Doug, but...  It wasn't happening.  Me to Doug, dude.  White man can't jump, huh?  I didn't have the cardio to, like, last the whole game.  How old were these kids?  Like, what were they, like, 14?  No, they were 19.  We asked them.  19. 
[03:42:00]  They were.  One was 19.  The one I was guarding was 19, and the other guys were, like...  One was, like, 24, and one was 22.  Yeah, but black kids look like they're 19 when they're 13 years old.  All right, all right, Alan.  You're tired, Hatties.  Why would you say that about black kids?  Jesus Christ.  They were very young, though.  Yeah, I don't believe that they were 19 and 24.  Do you, who, kid?  I asked them.  They go to BMCC at the college down there.  Dude, I'm getting my ass owned in this.  Oh, God.  By 15-year-olds.  Are you going to post it somewhere?  I'm going to give it to E-Rock.  Can we do it?  No, no, no, no.  I'll give it to E-Rock. 
[03:42:30]  E-Rock, will you make this into an E-Rock video?  Sure.  All right, this is the next E-Rock video.  What the fuck?  Yeah, all right, give it to E-Rock.  Ooh, that black kid just ducked on you.  You play basketball at all, Mike?  I put up a fucking brick, too.  No, me neither.  I can't do it.  My brother plays.  He does?  He played, and my dad loves basketball, and I never did.  Are you an athlete?  No, I'm flat-footed.  That's why you had to do this.  It'd be funny.  Uh-huh.  Were you one of those kids that had to be funny to not get beat up?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:43:00]  I know the struggle.  What's going on over there?  This guy's just blown right by me.  He's getting dunked on.  Every two of me, he threw a brick.  This is some funny shit.  Well, you're going to give that to E-Rock, right?  No, no, no, no.  We don't need to give that.  And it'll be up on the YouTube page.  That's ill, man.  Yo, can I ask one question, though?  Who?  Mike?  Yeah.  Yes.  Are you considered white, or what's the other color?  Because I ask every time, they don't want to be considered, like...  Yeah, I don't really identify with white people.  I don't understand.  I don't know.  I mean...  What does he look like to you? 
[03:43:30]  He's just kind of like...  Yeah, well, but they're just, like...  They're just goofy.  Oh, so you want, like...  I can...  I don't know.  That's the best answer ever.  You want, like, the coolness that black dudes have, but without that stigma of...  Yeah, I just try to be Italian.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  But that's what I was saying before, like, Italian...  I think I was half white, because I'm Italian, Irish, and Polish, so...  Damn.  But that's, like, a really white combination.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Isn't it?  That's like asbestos.  When my mom and my dad, she thought he was Puerto Rican, he's very dark, and my sister  thought he was black for, like, a long time.  But he's...  Your sister?  She thought my dad was black.  Do you have the same dad?  Yeah.  Oh, so your sister thought her dad was black?  Thought my...  Yeah, our dad was black.  Yeah, yeah, well...  Is she...  Is your sister black?  No.  Okay, well, then that would have been easy for her to figure out.  It probably shouldn't have been too complicated.  I mean, that's what I was saying.  Like, it seems like...  I mean, what does he look like to you?  Does he look like a white dude?  Yes. 
[03:44:30]  Does he look beige?  I don't know.  What is it?  He looks like a white guy.  Yeah.  And then on his bio for comedy, like, it says, he's a nice guy.  That's what it says.  It says, Mike is a nice guy.  That's an old bio that my ex-girlfriend wrote when we were dating.  She wrote the bio.  I got to change that.  Yeah.  Because it's awful.  Well, it says you're a nice guy.  It looks like it was written by...  Yeah.  Because, like, Greg Charles from Caroline's emailed me about you, and he was like, yeah,  he's really funny.  He sent me some links, and he was like, yeah, he's super dark.  And I was like, oh, okay.  And then I clicked your link, and it goes, Mike's a nice guy.  And I was like, I'm getting mixed messages. 
[03:45:00]  I don't know anything about this guy.  So you're not dating anybody anymore?  No.  What happened with your ex that wrote your...  I threw a fan into a wall.  Why'd you tell...  Like, somebody went to one of your shows?  What?  Like, they were cheering, Mike, get the fuck out of here.  It was like a long time ago, but something happened, and I just, I got mad, and I just  threw a fan into the wall.  Some new shit right there.  That's some real shit.  And she was like, I'm going to get out of here before that's my face.  That's like Italian.  That's what Italians do.  Whoa. 
[03:45:30]  Rageful people.  It's not like a white guy thing.  No, white guys tend to control their anger.  Although, I mean, when you look at psychopaths throughout history, there's a lot of crazy  white people.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  They may...  I mean, they're not going to throw a fan.  Right.  But they'll go and whatever.  They're going to be the ones that are shooting up a school.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know what I mean?  And it's more like sadistic.  Yeah.  And actually, you know what's funny?  There's a black guy that I work with, and I told him the other day, I was with this 
[03:46:00]  girl, and I threw a cum rag at her head.  A cum rag?  Yeah, like I...  Like you jerked off.  Yeah.  And you came into a rag.  Yeah.  You threw that at her head.  But it's a long story.  I mean, like, it's a long story.  I would imagine.  What?  Because we're live, right?  It's not like a thing where you can edit this out.  No.  Definitely not.  Why?  Are you wishing that you hadn't mentioned the cum rag?  No, because we were having sex the other night.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know if she's listening or not.  Probably not. 
[03:46:30]  Nobody else is.  All right.  And we're having sex, and she stops me.  Yeah.  And she's like, I can't do this.  I feel sick.  What?  While you're having sex?  Yeah.  Are you really bad at it?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe.  She's just like, this is...  I've never been on the other side, so it could be.  You've never gotten to go fuck yourself.  Yeah, I'm not going to find out.  Right.  And so she stops you.  She stops.  And then, so she was like, I can't.  I was like, that's fine.  And in the morning, I jerked off, and I threw the tissue on the floor. 
[03:47:00]  And then she was like, you have to pick that up off my floor.  And I was like, no, I don't.  Now, when you said no, I don't, was that because she asked you so matter-of-factly and forcefully?  Like, I'm in charge, and you have to pick that up.  Yeah.  And you were like, I'm not going to pick that up.  It's almost like it's your fault that that's...  It's almost like her fault that it's on her floor.  That should have been in you or on you.  Right.  I didn't mean to put that in the tissue.  I feel sick.  Well, you had a stomachache.  Now it's on your floor.  It was extremely wet.  No, it was just, like, balled up. 
[03:47:30]  Right.  A little moist.  Right.  And then she was like, you have to pick that up.  And I was like, no, I don't.  And she was like, we're not going to breakfast until you pick it up.  And I was hungry, so I was like, all right, I'll just pick it up.  Yeah, you had to get your pancakes.  Right.  And I'm not going to, like, you know, play that game.  Right.  I don't have time.  Right.  But on the way to the bathroom, I bounced it off her head. 
[03:48:00]  The look on her face was, like, fun, because she was just there, like, not, you know, she  was like, yeah, and she was like, how could you, it was, it was good.  And you were like, yeah, but we're supposed to be going to breakfast right now, so let's  go.  Well, I'm not going to waste my, it just bothered me that she was like, you have to do, you  have to do that.  Right.  Because I don't, no, I don't.  Right.  I will do it, to be polite, but not, not if you're going to command me.  Yeah.  You know.  They always act like our full sacks are not their problem.  And you're saying. 
[03:48:30]  And they kind of are a little bit.  Especially in your scenario.  Yeah.  You were like, my sack was becoming extra full.  Yeah.  Because of something that you were promising me.  Right.  You're now reneging on that.  Uh-huh.  In the middle of this.  Uh-huh.  I said reneging.  Uh-oh.  Negging.  There's a reneging.  In the middle.  Excuse me.  Of this whole thing.  So, yeah.  I mean, if you get a little messy floor, that's probably the least of your concerns.  Yeah.  Worst has been done for this equal crime.  You should have Norton in here for this speciality.  Because he loves touching his cum. 
[03:49:00]  He loves.  I mean, he has.  I don't know if that's just like.  He's tasted his cum, too, right?  He's tasted it.  Sure.  Have you ever tasted your cum?  By accident.  How did that happen?  How did that happen?  I think the tissue just got too close to my face.  You know what's funny?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  The cum comes out of your penis.  How does the tissue get to your face?  I don't remember.  But I remember that I tasted it by accident.  What did it taste like?  Like chemicals.  It wasn't good.  Chemicals.  You know what's funny, though?  My grandmother makes these Italian cookies called Chimels. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, shit.  And the dough for Chimels smells like cum.  But I didn't know cum.  Maybe the way your grandma makes it.  It's just funny.  It's the secret ingredient.  What's the name of them cookies again?  Chimels.  Chimels.  Yeah.  Chism bites.  But the first time I smelled cum, I was like, that smells like Chimel dough.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  This has got to be delicious.  I knew what Chimel dough.  Let me just be clear.  I knew what Chimel dough smelled like before I knew what cum smelled like.  Right.  Like you weren't like four years old and being like, Grandma, why does that smell like cum? 
[03:50:00]  You could squirt it up or like squirt it and it just like went on your chin or face.  No, I don't have a lot of power.  Take that little dick, man.  I didn't say that.  Who kid?  Jesus.  The size and the power are two different elements.  That's why he doesn't want to be white.  I have a very strong piss stream, I feel like.  Piss?  Yeah, I don't know how strong it is compared to other people.  Would you listen when you're in the bathroom?  Like, do you listen to hear if somebody's just stronger than yours?  No, but I just feel like mine is very, like I would put, I would put it up against any 
[03:50:30]  of you.  Is there like an R. Kelly meter or something?  Like, you know, R. Kelly's the king of that shit.  You're ready to compete.  Yeah, no, I mean.  If you have those talents where like you're, you're good at something.  It's like heavy, like a heavy urine.  It's like a strong, it's like a super soaker.  Get the fuck out of here.  When I was younger.  I don't want to come out here and toot my own horn, but.  I used to, I used to time the length of pee.  Like I used to, and when I started hitting like a minute straight of pissing, I'm like,  yeah, that's pretty fucking good. 
[03:51:00]  That's some spring break shit.  Yeah, but in what way?  I don't understand what that means.  They got the soaker.  They got the.  Oh, you just hit pissing the whole time.  Can you imagine that?  But I haven't been able to hit a minute in a very long time.  I think that that part of my life is over.  Like, I think I hit my peak as far as how long I could piss for.  29.  Okay.  29 seconds?  No, no, no.  That's how, that's my age.  I'm 29 years old.  I'm not 29 seconds old.  You're not 29 seconds?  Yeah, no.  I pissed for like a little over a minute.  Wow.  But that's like, you know, 17, 18, 19.  Right.  I think that's where I was at my best as far as pissing goes. 
[03:51:30]  Okay.  You're saying your stream is as powerful as ever.  Shit.  It's very powerful.  And I would put, I would imagine that it's powerful than most people's.  Well, I mean.  I would never, I guess there's no way of knowing that.  I feel like next time.  It's probably like comedy where like you start and you're like, I'm so funny.  And then you go up.  Wow.  There's some kind of piss stream competition.  Right.  I would like just lose.  Right.  I'd be like, all right.  All my friends say I'm hilarious.  All my friends say my piss stream is the greatest.  Well, maybe next time you're on the show.  Yeah.  We could bring like a big bowl here. 
[03:52:00]  Maybe we could pee in this shit.  We'll get some buckets.  Put a Japanese chick in there.  And yeah, we'll put a Japanese chick.  I mean, can you supply the Japanese chick?  Yeah, I could do that.  Could they like get peed on?  They do?  And shit it on.  And shit it on.  Well, we're not going to shit.  All of them.  I don't do this thing.  I like getting shit.  Corniche fucking what?  Every single last one.  Now, your wife is of Asian descent, correct?  I peed on her back.  Okay.  There were no follow-up questions.  There were no follow-up questions.  She's not a subscriber then?  Nah.  I just peed on her.  She likes getting on her spinal cord. 
[03:52:30]  Do you...  On her spinal cord.  Where do you pee on a woman?  Do you do it in the shower or...  No, in the bed.  Yeah, but then you get pee everywhere.  Right.  Or do you have the heavy quilt.  You know what I'm saying?  Absorb it.  How are people going to find these mixtapes that you put out?  Who could?  Well, what they could do is they could email me at djwhukinmp3 at gmail and just send me  their address.  And then up here, they could call up here, too.  Okay.  So maybe...  And it's at datpiff.com.  So it's for free there.  They could download. 
[03:53:00]  At datpiff?  What's datpiff mean?  It's where all the legal mixtapes are.  Where the black people go.  D-A-T-P-I-F-F?  Yeah.  Dot com?  Yeah.  And that's where you can download the Opie and Anthony mixtape?  Yeah, but up here, you can get the hard copy, and you guys can autograph it, and they  can get it.  Did you see it?  You didn't even see it.  No.  Can I get a copy of it?  This is, like, really hilarious.  We're out of time.  Do you sell those on the street?  Nah.  We don't know any Africans, but...  Can I give a bunch away tomorrow, maybe?  Of course.  All right.  I'll give a bunch away tomorrow.  Mike, you're at Caroline's tonight, 10 p.m. 
[03:53:30]  I think I might come through and check them out, man.  Yeah.  Please do.  If you're going out to see Norton, stick around for the 10 p.m. show, obviously.  I love the beach.  Mike has been hilarious, and, uh...  Yeah.  Jesus.  Put it on the floor.  Yeah.  So, good luck.  You can come back on the show, and we'll bring buckets.  Oh, that'd be great.  And we'll piss.  And Roland just sent me a note.  Do I have to piss on your show?  Can I just come back and talk?  You can probably talk, yeah.  I'll talk to you, too.  That's not, like, the stipulation, right?
