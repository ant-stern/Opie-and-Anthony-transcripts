<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Anthony Cumia describing his visit to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum to see the Space Shuttle Enterprise. He recounted negative online comments about the shuttle and discussed its history and the massive crane used to lift it.  A caller who worked on cranes provided engineering details.  The conversation then shifted to Cumia's impending jury duty, with him and Kenny attempting to postpone it. A listener, E-Train, called in to thank the hosts for their support following a foot amputation, leading to a discussion about prosthetic limbs and Oscar Pistorius.  A Cat Williams clip about Pistorius was played.

The show continued with a profane monologue about a disqualified legless runner, followed by a vulgar rant directed at an unseen individual.  Anthony's jury duty anxieties and attempts to avoid it were again discussed,  along with his concerns about his hair.  The hosts then played numerous clips of Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, mocking his speech impediments and speculating on the causes.  A caller offered an explanation, suggesting outdated references, leading to further mockery of Menino and discussion of his popularity despite his communication issues. More Menino clips were played, followed by listener calls and discussion of television shows like *The Wire*, *Breaking Bad*, *Mad Men*, *Lost*, and *Game of Thrones*, including an anecdote about a listener meeting Aaron Paul.  The hosts also criticized Michael Bloomberg's food cart policies.  The segment concluded with more Menino clips, a “Yente Explorers” skit, and a Jim Jefferies "Masturbation Memories" segment.  Upcoming guests Kevin Pollock and Jamie Hector were mentioned.

The next segment started with a humorous anecdote about seeing the Space Shuttle Enterprise with one's son, then transitioned to a discussion of electric cars, particularly Tesla and Elon Musk's SpaceX, including Mars colonization plans.  This led to a humorous aside about potential undesirable Martian colonists. The show then focused on analyzing a heavily produced *America's Got Talent* clip featuring a goth/glam singer, Andrew. The hosts dissected the clip, predicting and observing audience reactions, and wagered on the timing of their shocked responses.  Andrew's appearance prompted comparisons to various celebrities, including Robin Ruzan.  Jamie Hector then joined the studio.  The conversation covered Hector's acting techniques, research methods (shadowing detectives), and anecdotes about working with other actors, including positive experiences with John Cusack and negative ones with Paris Hilton.  The discussion included Hector's role in *The Wire*, comparisons to Omar Little, UFC, martial arts, and his acting philosophy.  Kevin Pollock also joined, promoting his podcast and book.

Jamie Hector remained a guest for the next segment, discussing film industry realities, script quality vs. film quality, and the success of low-budget films like *The Usual Suspects*. He recounted anecdotes about Burt Reynolds’ reaction to *Boogie Nights*. A large portion focused on promoting a paintball event Hector was organizing with *The Wire* cast members to benefit Moving Mountains NYC.  Several *Wire* actors were named. The conversation then turned personal, including discussions of Hector's fatherhood, Opie's sex addiction and sobriety, and challenges of raising children.  Anthony Cumia called in to boast about successfully avoiding jury duty. Kevin Pollock briefly rejoined the conversation. The final moments included discussions of OCD, the hosts' personal lives, and final plugs for Pollack's show and Hector's paintball event.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everybody.  Hi.  How's everyone this morning?  Well, discombobulated. There we go.  Hi, everybody.  How is everybody?  Oh, buddy.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Wow, wow.  Wow, wow.  It's hot in here, right?  It is a little warm in here, but we've just...  It's getting hot in here.  So take a...  I got to see the space shuttle yesterday.  The space shuttle.  The first person in space.  John is summer.  A lot of people had to point out, well, that shuttle never made it to space.  There's always buzz kills. 
[00:01:00]  No matter what you do, there's...  That's why I'm not into social media as much.  Uh-oh.  Because there's a buzz kill no matter what you try to do.  Yeah.  Some asshole that's miserable with their lives.  Yeah.  You got to...  So people had to point out, I tweeted a picture of the space shuttle going on the Intrepid  with that giant crane I was showing you.  Yeah.  Took a bike ride with my son down there.  Like, hey, this is kind of cool.  I kind of grew up with the space shuttle program.  Yes. 
[00:01:30]  And now there's one, a mere mile or two from my house.  I took a bike ride down there and I tweeted a picture or whatever.  I'm not trying to promote my Twitter.  I'm just saying.  Ooh.  And I post it.  And people...  Most people, you know, normal fucking human beings, I call them.  I call them normal human fucking beings.  Pretty cool.  Hey, pretty cool.  Pretty amazing.  That's amazing.  Wow.  All right.  You got to...  Wow.  You know, nice little comments, which I appreciate, by the way, more than you realize.  And then there's got to be both...  You know, not a big deal. 
[00:02:00]  That space shuttle never made it into space.  You know, it barely did anything.  It doesn't even look like the other space shuttles because they changed the design of  the space shuttle.  Are they just spoiling it for a while?  Oh, Christ.  It gets exhausting.  Technically.  Basically, yeah.  Technically, you know, if you look at it closely, it doesn't even really look like  the other space shuttles because they redesigned it.  Their buzz kills?  Oh, they're the worst.  You know, they got the big wind fairing on the back, so you can't even see the engines. 
[00:02:30]  And I know talking about this is just going to make it worse, but whatever.  Whatever.  We did get chipped.  We got the shittiest space shuttle.  Thank you.  No, actually, the Johnson Space Center got the worst one.  But then other people from other cities, you know, New York City doesn't even deserve  that.  Should have went to Houston.  And then everyone in whatever city they're from, you should have went to whatever.  My city.  Houston got the, Johnson Space Center got the one that's made out of, like, wood.  It's like a complete mock-up. 
[00:03:00]  They got a wood one?  A wooden space shuttle?  Just a wooden, fucking wooden space shuttle.  Really?  They got the shittiest, like, a mock-up.  It wasn't one that was used for, like, anything.  So what?  It's like the first model?  Like, we think this might fly, so let's carve it.  This could be the one.  All right.  We got this.  Now start making the real ones, guys.  See, I'm stupid.  I just assume some idiot had a blueprint and go, all right, here's the space shuttle.  Here it is.  Make these and let's start flying them.  But it goes through a whole process, obviously.  Yeah.  What does it do?  What do they start with?  Drawings, obviously. 
[00:03:30]  And then they go with a wood mock-up?  And then there were some mock-ups.  Why a wood mock-up?  Because that's cheap?  I guess so.  And then they, it was like wood and aluminum.  Okay.  An aluminum frame and stuff.  But I guess they used it for real basic shit.  Right.  You know, like just a mock-up for maybe to see how big a hanger you would need.  Okay.  Or, like, just how it would fit in certain instances.  So, yeah, Johnson Space Center got that one.  We got the one in New York that they used just for glide testing off the 747 years ago. 
[00:04:00]  It actually glided off the 747.  It glided in, yeah, yeah.  Okay, gotcha.  It glided in.  So, it had some engines and shit.  Yeah, but it never, no, no, it never really used engine power at all, ever.  Wait, so they would just, how?  The shuttle's a glider.  Once it gets in the atmosphere, it doesn't use the engines.  Yeah, but don't you need some kind of shit to kind of, like, make sure it's on track?  Yeah, but it's just, it uses, like, regular surface.  That's it?  Yeah, like an airplane.  But it's just a glider.  There's no power with a space shuttle when it was, once it came through the atmosphere. 
[00:04:30]  That was it.  No power.  You got one shot to glide it in.  It's amazing.  What?  The shuttle never crashed during a landing.  And why didn't they have engines in it?  Because that was too much weight, I would assume.  Well, no, they didn't really need any engines in the Enterprise.  Just in case you're the guy and you're like, oh, fuck, I'm a little off here.  I'm going to need a little power to get it back to the left a little bit.  You couldn't fire those engines up in a glide.  It would be crazy.  Didn't have a little something, something?  No, it was all just fucking surfaces, wing surfaces and stuff. 
[00:05:00]  Wow.  You know what?  I never knew that.  They said it was like flying in, you needed computer assist because it was like flying  a brick.  You look at it, it doesn't look very aerodynamic.  I like showing my stupidity.  I assumed.  Yeah.  Had some engines to do the space thing.  Nah.  And then when it came through the atmosphere, it turned into a plane.  Nah, it just glides.  Turned into a little plane.  It had one fucking shot to land.  And I'm brave enough to say that because I bet you there's a few other people going,  yeah, that's what I thought too. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, there's plenty of fucking people.  I thought it turned into some kind of plane.  Didn't know that.  It turned into an aerial plane.  Doesn't it have to go, it has to circle like with the front end up to kind of buffer it  and slow it down.  It has to just take giant looping circles to slow down.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's what it would do.  It would come through the atmosphere, pretty much belly in, and that's where all the heat tiles  were and on the leading edge of the wings and stuff like that.  And that would slow it down like a lot.  And then they would do these kind of back and forth maneuvers to scrub off the speed 
[00:06:00]  because that's really the only way they could slow down was to just scrub the speed off  by turning.  So you really needed to know what the fuck you were doing.  Oh, yeah.  Those guys really needed to know where they were.  So you're not out of fucking land.  You're not asleep at the wheel.  No, you can't be asleep at the switch.  Most of our pilots as we take our plane rides.  Every shuttle commander pilot had to be a sully. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  Every one of them.  So they went from a wood model to what?  And then the Enterprise?  Enterprise.  Or was there something in between, you think?  Enterprise for glide testing and stuff like that.  I'm sure they had like simulators just for the inside so that the guys knew where all  the shit was, you know, you didn't have to have a working, actual working space shuttle  to teach the guys and the crew just to orient yourself.  The big cargo bay in the back, you know, how to work shit in there. 
[00:07:00]  It would be a waste to have an actual working space shuttle to just have everybody learn  their respective places in there.  So there were a lot of mock-ups.  I got to tell you, I was more impressed with this crane they had.  Yeah.  I'm obsessed with the crane they had to lift it up and onto the Intrepid.  Huge, right?  I don't, I think it's the biggest crane I've ever seen.  Yeah.  This thing was, I was trying to explain it to you and I took a few pictures and it doesn't  do it justice.  Maybe someone that knows this shit could call in. 
[00:07:30]  It was amazing.  Yeah.  It had this huge, like, rotating thing that looked as big as, or as wide as, like, a New  York City building.  Really?  Just to turn the whole fucking crane.  How'd they figure that shit out?  I don't know.  And then there was like, there was at least two dozen guys on the barge and the crane structure.  Yeah.  At least.  And then one of the guys goes, hey man, I've been a big fan of you guys forever.  I'm one of those guys on the crane.  And I'm thinking, if, if, I wish, I wish he knew that I was down there. 
[00:08:00]  Maybe I could have got a little, uh, VIP action.  I'll get down on that thing, huh?  Yeah.  So I just want to say this.  I live in New York City and I fucking, I, I always look for cool shit to do.  If you're one of those guys that gets to do cool shit, fucking get ahold of me on my  Twitter.  Please.  Give me a little, give me a little closer to some of this shit.  If I could get closer to this cool shit.  That's my thing.  Jimmy likes the celebrity photos and all that.  If something's going on in New York, I try to check it out.  You want some of the cool shit going on?  I try to check it out.  Yeah, there is usually some cool shit going on in New York. 
[00:08:30]  But people, you know, were there.  I just missed when they were lowering it down.  I think that would have been kind of cool.  There's video everywhere of it, I guess, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was watching it on the news.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yesterday.  Just kind of, oh, that's pretty fucking cool.  And what's cool is like from my, uh, living room, I could, I could see the Intrepid and  I could see the space shuttle.  It's a tiny little fucking dot in the horizon.  But I'm like, that's the space shuttle.  I could see it every fucking day.  I see how they put it to the, um, which I guess is the rear of the, uh, Intrepid, which 
[00:09:00]  is closer to the river side.  Right.  So you can't drive by and really get a good view of it because they want people to go  into the fucking place.  And I do think they're going to cover it.  Aren't they putting a structure around it?  What fucking assholes?  Because there's a pier just south of the Intrepid where, I mean, and hurry up.  I mean, if you're a New Yorker, there's a, there's a pier just south of the Intrepid,  you get a fucking solid look at it.  Yeah.  And if they're going to put a structure up, go soon.  I think. 
[00:09:30]  Because it's pretty cool to see it from that vantage point.  I think what I heard was NASA, uh, some of the conditions that they put out for any  of these cities.  Well, they probably don't want it in the weather.  Yeah, they don't want it in the weather.  So they, one of the conditions that they have is, uh, that it's got to be covered.  And that's, I guess, for all the shuttles that they gave to all the respective cities.  I just called everyone an asshole, but that makes sense.  Yeah, because it was probably, we got shitty weather in New York, man.  Fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah, that isn't really meant to be outside.  Some of these, a lot of the planes that they have on the deck of the Intrepid are outside  and just left outside.  Yeah.  But I guess, uh, the shuttle is a pretty delicate thing. 
[00:10:00]  You know, people always ask me, what, what should I do if I come to New York?  And I don't feel like really answering anybody.  I don't really feel like.  So I'll say it on the air.  Go to the Intrepid.  Yeah.  It's all air and space museum inside.  I'm not an air and space guy like, like we went down to Washington once and we went to the  air and space museum together after our XM interview, our secret XM interview back in  the day.  Yeah.  And you were, you were pretty much coming, man.  Oh, I loved it.  You were out of that shit.  And I was like, yeah, this is kind of cool, but you take it to a whole nother level. 
[00:10:30]  You love this shit.  Because it's like watching all those history shows and just reading about it and stuff.  You, you, you know, these planes, right?  And it's the actual fucking planes.  Yeah.  When you see, you know, the, uh, the, um, uh, first plane that broke the, uh, the sound  barrier, you know, uh, Chuck Yeager's fucking plane.  Um, if you come to New York though, I would definitely go to the Intrepid.  Here's the deal.  They, uh, what did they do?  They remodeled it or something and cleaned it up or they took it out of there for a while.  I saw there was a big banner.  It reopens, uh, July 19th. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  That's my birthday.  That's why they're doing that.  Oh, no, it's not.  They got one of the Concords down there now on the, on the dock next to, uh, yeah.  Like, uh, really?  Yeah.  Like there's, uh, one of the overhead shots.  That's, uh, they got one of the Concords.  You're able to go inside and check it out.  You go inside the Concord?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have a little, uh, and they got a little submarine right next to the Intrepid you  could go on.  Yeah.  Submarine.  Which is kind of creepy, but cool.  Yeah.  And then on the Intrepid, the actual deck of the Intrepid, there's a lot of, uh, famous, uh, 
[00:11:30]  types of aircraft from various wars and, and stuff.  Uh, the Intrepid itself is, uh, it's cool to just walk around with a history.  That's like an amazing, uh, war history.  Yeah.  I believe it had a kamikaze hit too.  No, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What song?  Uh, well, it was, uh, Hang Chang Fa.  Now wait, where, where, where is the actual shuttle going?  To the rear of the, they moved shit around, but it's, it's right back there.  Pretty much where it says, uh, Intrepid back there, right back there. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  It's to the Southwest of the Intrepid.  Yeah.  So like I said, there's a pier just South.  And I mean, you walk to the end of the pier and it's a really nice view of the, of the  shuttle right now.  Yeah.  And if they're going to cover it up, that's going to, you know, that vantage point is going  to be taken away.  You know, I was right there.  I was right at the end there.  There I was.  I'll maybe they'll cover it with something glass or something transparent.  Uh, no, they'll go with some kind of, that's gotta be hard to keep clean and shit.  I don't know.  They're going to cover it up.  I bet they will.  Cause they'll make a lot of money from people wanting to just check it out. 
[00:12:30]  Maybe they'll paint like a shuttle on the outside of it.  The structure and be like, Hey, look, what's in here.  Or saran wrap.  There'll probably be a big white structure with the NASA logo on the side.  That's it.  One of those tuxedo shirts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a tuxedo t-shirt.  Hey, how much is the Intrepid?  I've never gone there.  $8 billion to go on.  Oh, see, that's why it's not affordable.  They just need one guy.  You've got to take out a second mortgage, but it's well worth it.  Where is the good shuttle?  Uh, there's a few of them.  There's a, I guess, um, DC got one of the, uh, ones that was actually used in space. 
[00:13:00]  For the air and space?  Yeah.  The air and space got, I can't remember which one.  Um, and then I guess, did LA get one?  Why would LA get one over New York?  I don't know.  Because.  DC is closer probably.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, they're springing out, New York, DC, LA, I would assume Houston.  Houston got the shitty one.  Johnson Space Center got the shitty one.  And then, um.  Wait, which one?  The wood one you were saying?  The cape they got.  They got a good one.  Yeah, let me say hi to Kate in Tennessee.  Kate.  Hey, um, I was just going to tell you guys, Chantilly, Virginia, I think it is, which is 
[00:13:30]  outside of Washington, has, uh, has a space shuttle, and it also has the Enola Gay.  Ooh.  And a lot of other cool shit.  It was really awesome.  The Enola Gay.  Ooh, the big one.  Drop the big one on those jabs.  Yep.  Wait, where's the Enola Gay?  Virginia?  In Chantilly, I think it is.  It's right outside of DC.  Chantilly lays in a funny face and a ponytail hanging down. 
[00:14:00]  What?  What?  Is that the telephone?  Is that the telephone song?  He's on the phone.  It's my baby.  Hello, baby.  Where he's walking from one phone to another.  Oh, it's stunk.  That video's terrible.  A Chantilly lace.  A little, baby.  Yeah, this is the big bopper speed.  Oh, boy.  Too low, baby.  The wings are covered with snow, baby. 
[00:14:30]  And down we go, baby.  Metal in my face.  You're going to spiral when she talks.  Iraq, we did this, right?  Yeah.  We did this.  Oh, yeah.  That's my new thing.  We love this.  Speaking of doing bits over and over, remember the other day you guys were talking about just  impulsive thoughts that you just don't act on?  Yeah.  I was going through some old stuff just yesterday, and there was a bit from 2007 called The Crazy 
[00:15:00]  Thoughts You Don't Act On.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, well, we update these things.  It's like a dateline and stuff.  We were updating a story we told you about in 2007.  I don't mind, because A, a lot of people haven't heard it, and then B, you kind of added new shit to it.  Yeah, we've done them.  It's like when they turn 48 hours into a dateline.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  They just extend it slightly.  Let's go to Jim in Jersey.  Jim?  Yeah, I'm right here. 
[00:15:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Let's go, let's go, let's go.  Yeah.  Go.  Yellow.  Talking to me?  Yes, sir.  Talking to me?  All right.  The only reason I'm going here is...  The only one here.  You say you work on those cranes all the time.  I work on cranes, and I do a lot of work on cranes.  Oh, sorry.  You can do this.  That big housing you're talking about, that's basically, that's the center pin.  Everything pivots on that, and that's basically all the counterweights.  That's how they calculate weights.  Nah, man.  We don't need this type of discussion. 
[00:16:00]  Way too deep.  I need, like, how large is the pin on that crane?  Oh, it's huge.  I know it's huge.  I told Ann, massive.  So that's not helping anyone.  Like, how big, though?  So people can wrap their heads around it.  I don't know.  Probably two foot.  It's just all steel, and the biggest crane in the world, like the biggest mobile crane,  that, I don't know if you're going down Turnpike, the Lampson.  And it's huge.  I'd say there was two of them.  The one fell over. 
[00:16:30]  Uh-huh.  The roof on a stadium.  Weren't they using some of the bigger cranes down at Ground Zero at one point?  They had, like, three of the biggest ones?  Uh, yeah.  Not, well, like I said, there's only two that are, like, really huge.  And the one fell when I put the roof on a stadium.  Got wind shear.  Sir, was the crane that was down at the Intrepid the biggest one in the world, or close to it?  We all know about cranes in general.  Probably close to it.  Close to it. 
[00:17:00]  I bet not.  You bet not?  Especially since it's on the water.  Really?  Yeah, like, they got some big motherfucking cranes.  This thing was big, Ed.  I mean, giant.  Massive.  See the ones that they're using to build the motherfucking one-world trade?  Yeah.  They're fucking huge.  I guess the crane down at the Intrepid was also the one that pulled Sully's plane out of the Hudson.  Oh, is it?  That's what they're telling me.  Those guys get a lot of work.  So, there you go.  When shit falls in the fucking river.  That was my night, going down there to check it out. 
[00:17:30]  It was cool.  I liked it.  I liked it.  Oh, man.  Kenny couldn't get my fucking jury duty.  Dang.  They said no because I've blown it off a couple times.  Wait, you're leaving us?  I don't know.  What do I do?  What do I do?  This sucks.  And then I fucking just realized it's not in New York City, dummy, because I don't live in New York City.  Right.  So, I'd have to go all the way to fucking Mineola.  By 8.30?  Is that what it is?  You might have to go do jury duty now? 
[00:18:00]  I know.  Well, I'll get there at some point.  Oh, Kenny's texting me again.  Hold on.  Let's get an update.  All right.  Hi.  Hi.  Are you on the air?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I can't go now.  Why?  Is it 8.30?  Kenny, could you come in here, Kenny?  Kenny?  Kenny?  Kenny? 
[00:18:30]  Kenny?  Where's Kenny?  Look at him.  He's just staring at his phone.  He's just staring at his phone.  Kenny?  Kenny?  Could you come here a minute?  Kenny?  What happened?  Kenny, I would have to leave.  Why now?  Can I leave in like an hour?  You would leave now.  Anthony doesn't have to leave now.  Yeah.  Well, you have to stop home and...  Oh, well, that's not too far.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Well, you know, if you're not early, you're not on time.  So, wait, he can't get out of this?  He's fucking working.  Well, there's nothing I can do day of at 6.30 in the morning.  All right, baby, I put this off a bit.  What, did you talk to him?  I got an automated computer that fucking denied your postponement because you already had one.  So, I could call back after 8.30 and try to reason with a person.  Oh, on the radio.  Yeah, he's on the air.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  Well, that's not an exception according to New York court rules. 
[00:19:30]  That's crazy.  Yeah, it should be.  Just reason with them at 8.30.  I'm an important person.  No, but it's...  Well, just reason with them at 8.30.  Oh, can I get a doctor's note from Dr. Steve?  Yes, you can.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you really have to be sick, though.  I mean, I know you are feeling under the weather, so...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I screwed up, right, Kenny?  I should have maybe come to you a little sooner with this one?  If you'd come to me, then this scum who ruined your daughter would be doing jury duty at this point. 
[00:20:00]  That I cannot do.  Yes.  Oh, Kenny, I screwed up.  What?  Just do your civic duty.  Duty?  He is.  He's entertaining the public.  Yes, that's what I do.  Well, entertain them from a jury box.  You go reason with them, Kenny.  We've got a radio show to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have a big guest today.  We're very busy.  We're already off to a fine start.  This is much more important than, you know...  That's right.  Some skell's going to get up there, and I'm going to have to fucking be like, oh...  Don't you want to convict some people? 
[00:20:30]  I really do.  Exactly.  You do?  Oh, they don't want me on a jury.  Believe me.  Believe me.  You're going to get kicked off in a heartbeat.  I really would.  I would.  Look, people that run this thing, this show, you don't want me on there anyway.  I would look and be like, oh, that figures.  So, you know.  Yeah, so...  I'll just bring this with me, and when they say, uh, Mr. Cumia, do you have any...  They're like, oh, okay, we know what that means.  So you're doing them a favor by not showing up.  Yes.  You're just wasting their time. 
[00:21:00]  I'm wasting their time.  I don't need to do that.  And isn't it our time?  And isn't it our time, Mr. Hand?  Yeah, but you get paid $40 a day.  Oh, wow.  Wowie, wow, wow.  I don't understand why more people would want to do this.  Yeah.  Sam's going to quit and just do jury duty full-time.  Just do jury duty.  It's easier.  Probably make more money.  Yeah.  Talk to more people, too.  We got a guy that, I don't know, he's missing a limb or something.  What?  He wants to thank us about it.  Oh, criminy.  And it's only a $1,000 fine. 
[00:21:30]  That's it?  That's it?  Well, or, and, or up to 30 days imprisonment.  They're not going to do the 30 days.  Does anyone go to jail for not going to jury duty?  No, they'll give you one more shot at it.  Does anyone, has anyone gone to jail?  And I don't mean, like, when you're in contempt and you really fuck up and shit like that and  tell the judge bad things when they call you in.  But, like, like, you just don't show up.  Has anyone really been locked up?  No.  Take the $1,000 hit.  We got a radio show to do.  Man.  Hey, who's this?  E-Train.  E-Tron. 
[00:22:00]  E-Train from Worcester, man.  How you guys doing today?  E-Train.  E-Train in the house.  That's a dumb name, that is.  The boys are telling me that you want to thank us for helping you through an amputation?  Yeah.  For the, about five, well, for the past five years, I've been going through several surgeries.  And about three months ago, it culminated with the front half of my right foot being amputated.  Oh, wow.  What, what was it? 
[00:22:30]  Diabetes?  No, not diabetic.  I have a neuropathy.  The hell is that?  And, like, what it is, it's like a deadening of nerves.  It's like, externally, I have no feeling, but internally, it shoots off, like, with pain.  So, I get a sore, or I cut or something, and I don't feel it.  Like, uh, kick-ass.  First of all, you only have part of your foot missing.  Let's be honest with each other.  You get a lot done still.  Oh, yeah.  Second of all, how did we get you through this? 
[00:23:00]  Well, I spent a lot of time home alone because I can't work or anything, but listening to  you guys, it really is like hanging out with friends.  So, it makes things, you know, a little easier for me.  Why don't you get a, why don't you become a field goal kicker, like Tom Dempsey?  Oh, yeah.  The great Tom Dempsey.  Half a foot.  He had half a foot.  Half a foot guy.  I don't think it's legal anymore in the NFL.  Yeah, look up Tom Dempsey.  I didn't know that.  He was missing the front half of his foot, and he had the field goal record for many,  many, many, many, many years.  Yeah, that looks stumpy foot, flat boot. 
[00:23:30]  I know someone tied it, but did someone actually beat it?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Oh, look at that dumb boot with the laces up the side.  Oh, you know that.  You don't know if it's been beaten.  Yeah, I'm not sure if it was beaten.  I know it was tied because he was in the news recently, but he played for the Saints,  I believe.  61 yards?  And he had, I want to go 63, Jimmy.  Oh, wow.  I want to, I want to, I want to trump you.  You want to?  You probably are right.  I think it was 63.  I want to go 75.  Go 75?  I can throw the ball that far.  No, you can't, Jim.  It was a, the boot looked ridiculous, but back then they didn't really have Nike and, and 
[00:24:00]  the rest of them.  It looks like a sledgehammer.  He kind of made it at home, I believe.  Yeah, it's a flat front.  That looks like a perfect thing to kick a ball with.  Of course, it's a metal front.  Shit, right?  Yeah.  See, that's the thing I'm worried about.  They just fitted me for the shoes.  So I'm worried about getting that Herman Munster shoe.  Why?  You could just have a shoe and have nothing in the front, right?  So what, you were at home and you were listening to us while you recovered?  You just stuffed some crack paper in like a new sneaker. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a mixture of you guys and Call of Duty, so.  A good friend of mine had a big Herman Munster shoe like that.  Herman Munster shoe.  I love that it's called that.  I had Herman Munster shoes, too.  Did you?  Remember?  My shape-ups.  Oh, your shape-ups.  You were pretty jocky.  Are you part of the litigation?  I could be.  Huge litigation.  Class action suit, right?  Class action suit.  I could get a few bucks.  What's the suit for?  I guess they claimed all sorts of shit and, uh, what? 
[00:25:00]  I didn't hear you.  Horrible, what's the suit for joke?  What'd you say?  We both butted heads.  When you want to look nice.  That's not funny when you make fun of legal stuff.  Oh, chip.  I don't go for that.  Literal chip.  They were claiming all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  It helps back problems and all that, and it doesn't help anything.  Of course not.  Shoes?  It feels good when you're standing on line, though, because you could rock back and forth.  You just rock back and forth, so it's kind of fun, but it doesn't do anything.  So your legs don't ache from standing in one position for too long. 
[00:25:30]  Someone just figured, oh, let's make the bottom of these shoes like a seesaw.  They look good for the back.  No, it's not.  They look ridiculous, but they are comfortable.  I haven't worn them in almost a year because I got too much abuse.  Well, what about the fucking Yeezys coming out today, yo?  The what?  Is that today?  The new fucking sneaker coming out, yo.  Isn't there one that...  What was the sneaker that they're already selling online for $80,000?  That's the Yeezy.  What is it?  $80,000.  It's fucking...  I guess...  Is it Kanye's sneaker? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, Kanye West.  I think.  Who the fuck wants to wear his...  He's such a baby, that guy.  People are going to die over this sneaker.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  If that was true, there was a report that one was online for $80,000.  I don't think anyone's paying.  That's like the extreme.  But that's a guy that goes, look, I'll get in the news.  I'm going to try to sell these for $80,000.  Sell them for $80,000.  Geez.  But I think this particular sneaker, people are going to fucking die.  Yeah.  We got a sneaker shop in our neighborhood on 72nd Street. 
[00:26:30]  These guys tweet when they don't have the sneakers because they don't want the scene.  Oh, so they're like, look, please stay away.  Yeah, I get up really early and these guys will wait out all night just to get the latest sneaker.  And this particular store doesn't get every single one.  So they'll tweet like, please don't come.  We do not have this particular sneaker.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a big deal, the sneaker culture.  How much for the Air Yeezys, motherfucker?  Can I see what it looks like?  I want to see the Kanye shoe.  The Air Yeezy.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, shit.  It looks like fucking Back to the Future shoes.  That looks retarded.  You know the dumb Velcro thing?  Was it for old people?  Wow, I don't like that at all, but I'm not in that world.  You're looking at sneakers that are going to get people shot.  Absolutely.  Seven Gs they want.  Well, it's for both pairs.  Oh, for the black pair and the white pair.  Yeah, there's the platinum and the black.  With gold platinum.  What was the 80,000 one then?  That guy's just a jerk off.  He's just an asshole.  He's just trying to bang someone out.  You know, you put your sneakers up on eBay, you bang that out.  No one's counting fucking eyelets. 
[00:27:30]  If you're a jerk off, I'll sell you an empty box.  Right.  You get the empty box, you put it in your car, you leave, you fucking sell the sneakers to  someone.  You guarantee that they're real Air Yeezys.  No one's counting sneakers.  No one's counting fucking shoelaces.  Right.  You bang it out.  What are they called?  Inglets?  Inglets?  Is it inglets or eyelets?  Those things on the, there's the eyelets or the holes, and then the inglets on the end  of the laces.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Did you guys know that when we had, uh.  Yes, I did.  I didn't.  I figured you would. 
[00:28:00]  I should have said, Ant, did you know that when we had Chris Hemsworth in here, that  he's going to be Miley Cyrus' brother-in-law?  Yes.  I didn't know that.  No, his brother is.  No, that's what I said.  He's going to be her brother-in-law.  Oh, brother-in-law.  Yeah.  You said it correct.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  Well, that just, they just got engaged.  No, but I didn't even know the guy was dating.  The brother's the fall.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, the guy from Hunger Games is supposedly marrying Miley Cyrus.  Good luck with that.  Good luck with that shit.  Hey, uh, E-Train.  Yeah, brother.  So, I'm happy you're doing well.  You're going to get fitted for the sneaker?  I mean, the shoe? 
[00:28:30]  I think they do pretty good with that these days.  Well, man, I'm just really eager to get back to work and get back to a normal life.  You know, it's been a long time, so I'm really...  Where do you work?  Footlocker?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, yeah.  Half a Footlocker?  Yes.  Got a job at IHOP.  Professional runner.  Professional hopscotcher.  Where are you working?  Yeah, where do you work?  At the leg store?  No, Chip.  That isn't even fucking...  I used to be a teacher, but not anymore.  Right now, I'm just healing.  That's my main job right now. 
[00:29:00]  Is that serious?  You should go with the jump rope competition.  Oh.  You'd have a slight advantage over everyone.  Oh.  My tootsie's always gotten in the way.  Yeah.  It was always my toes.  Hated jump rope.  No one can step on your toe.  Oh, that's a good fucking...  That's true.  Right.  That's true.  You gotta make some lemonade here, my friend.  Maybe you could drive in a tow truck.  Oh.  And also, I want to give a very special thanks to Jim, man.  I love the stand-up.  Oh, you're welcome.  Don't be a heel. 
[00:29:30]  I'm glad I inspired you.  I'm glad you got over that arch in your life.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  I see.  Thank you.  I'm glad you're okay, man.  Yeah, absolutely, brother.  You're a good soul.  Hey, Jim.  I hate to be a chipper, but any chance I could come see you perform tomorrow?  Oh, look at him.  Tomorrow?  I'm not doing anything special tomorrow.  No, Foxwood.  Saturday, right?  Saturday?  Yeah, Foxwoods, I mean, yes.  What's your name?  E-Train.  E-Train Martinez.  I can give you my last name off air.  No, no, no.  Well, here's what.  Give it to the E-Rock or something, and I will put you... 
[00:30:00]  Oh, they're saying no, because it's standing room only.  Oh.  I'm going to put you in the special seat.  That's Edgar Head.  Well, we do a thing where your foot will be...  We're going to put the spotlight on it, and we're all going to riff on it.  Yes, I will make sure you get into the show.  Oh, that's nice.  Just give you a last name, and I'll have you and a friend come to the show Saturday with  me, Artie, Dave, and Nick DePaulo at Foxwoods.  Oh, man.  You guys are awesome, man.  Thank you so much.  All right, buddy. 
[00:30:30]  Thank you for the call, and just give your name off air, okay?  I didn't do anything.  I will.  All right, buddy.  All right, E-Train.  Good luck to you, brother.  Thank you, man.  God bless.  Thanks.  Supposedly, there's controversy with a sprinter that has two spatulas.  Oh, were those spatulas, yeah?  I hung up on the guy.  Fuck.  Those springy spatula legs.  What's the controversy?  Ah, shit.  I fucking really hung up on the guy.  What's the controversy?  E-Train callback.  I didn't mean to do that.  Yeah, E-Train callback was a mistake.  I don't know.  I didn't read the whole story.  I just saw a guy with spatula legs, and they said that, you know, he's got one more race 
[00:31:00]  to qualify for the Olympics or something.  Why don't they just let him do it?  Like, are we that caught up with confidence?  Have you seen spatula leg guys run?  I'm sure he can haul ass.  Holy fuck, they know what they're doing.  But a guy with fucking no legs who's running, how about you cut him a fucking break?  You get a nice bounce off the bottom of that spatula fucking foot.  Yeah, but you got stumps.  Who knows about this?  Because I didn't think we were going to talk about this today.  I just saw a quick headline.  You're going to lose a leg than a hand, right?  Because you can still...  I would go leg over a fucking arm any day.  I've seen these guys. 
[00:31:30]  It's amazing what they're doing with the legs.  It still sucks, obviously, but...  Poor girl who had fucking lost her leg, her foot, and both hands to that fucking flesh-eating thing in Georgia.  Oh, that's terrible!  24 years old, man.  It's fucking miserable.  There he is.  First set.  Oscar Pistarious.  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.  Fights to become first double amputee to qualify for the Olympics.  There it is.  God.  There it is.  Is there a video of this guy running?  You've got to see how these guys run.  Do they walk in those, too, or is that just for running?  No, no, that's for running. 
[00:32:00]  No, they go with the one with the fucking...  That's high performance.  They can just snap in other fucking legs for walking.  Yeah, that's what they do.  Snap in legs for fucking all kinds of various things that you do.  Yeah.  But you at least make yourself taller.  Hey, you could, right?  Oh, man.  Never even thought of that.  Yeah, give me a couple inches.  I always wanted to be about 6'2".  Wish I lost my leg.  Yikes.  I would name myself the spatula tootsie kid.  Spatula tootsie kid. 
[00:32:30]  Here's the guy.  Here's the guy.  Wow, he hauls ass, right?  He's a sprinter.  What's his race?  Do we know?  White, white.  Oh, Jesus.  Damn it, Jimmy.  I'm going to go with the 400 meter.  Looks like they're doing a lap.  Two punny douchebags.  I know.  Assholes.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  That looks weird.  He looks like a bug.  Watch this, though.  This is...  That's amazing.  This is completely insane.  How does he do this?  Running for the gun to go off. 
[00:33:00]  Food.  I've seen these guys in the park.  It's ridiculous.  Everybody's probably looking at him like, all right, well, we know who the last place is.  Yeah.  Oscar Pistorius in four for South Africa.  Watch this.  South Africa.  And the bird's nest roars as the final event on the track is underway.  And Oscar Pistorius got outside.  How do you not slide?  Where is he?  How do you not slide in the right?  I know, right?  Oh, there is the third one in.  In the white.  And the cheetah is coming on his spatula.  Yes.  Here comes the cheetah.  Look at him beating people with legs. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Look at this.  I know he can't.  We'll put it on our Facebook page.  Crazy.  Everyone's embarrassed losing to a man with two egg flippers on their legs.  Look at that.  How is he doing this?  Let's have a look at the time.  You know what? 
[00:34:00]  I'll tell you how it propels you forward.  Of course.  You're bouncing.  Less weight.  Yeah, I was just thinking it's got to be a lot less weight.  I mean, your legs weigh a lot.  That doesn't weigh as much as your real legs.  It's all carbon fiber and shit.  Do they use, like, some kind of counterweight to make it fair?  I mean, I can't imagine that's fair.  Well, they figure the fact that you have no legs kind of comes out in the watch.  You have stumps.  It comes out in the watch.  You know what, though?  You don't get the muscle fatigue?  I don't know, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm all for this type of shit, but I don't know. 
[00:34:30]  You can't turn an ankle.  It doesn't seem like it's fair.  Believe it or not.  That's for sure.  Oh, man.  So what are they deciding?  Your trainer.  Your fucking trainer is coming up to you with Allen keys.  There you go.  You got it.  Now that's perfect.  Yeah, pit crew.  I'll tell you how they make it fair is the other guys don't have to worry about a leg flying off  if they want to turn.  That's true.  Yeah, maybe they unloosen a few bolts and then that makes it fair.  They really must have to fucking tighten those up on his legs.  I don't know if it's fair, to be honest with you.  What are they saying?  They're confused by this guy. 
[00:35:00]  You should put some baby oil under the bottom.  Then we'll see how good he is.  Imagine a wet track and that shit comes sliding out.  He has sparks.  Put a magnet there.  He's stuck.  Yes.  What do we know about him?  He has no legs.  He's fast.  I don't know anything about him.  I'm now curious what the controversy is.  Obviously, he has no legs, but what are they trying to figure out?  If it's legal or not?  Yeah, I guess so.  Maybe there's nothing in the bylaw.  You got it, Danny. 
[00:35:30]  In 2007, his dreams came to a standstill when debate over whether or not his prosthetics gave him an unfair advantage led the International Association of Athletics Federations to pass a new rule that banned any technical device that provided a user an advantage over another athlete not using such a device.  I got to agree with this.  I don't think this should be allowed in the Olympics.  I'm sorry.  I think there should be like a special, well, special Olympics, some kind of other Olympic thing.  But to have, it's supposed to be for people, just their bodies, whatever it is. 
[00:36:00]  If you don't have legs, I do apologize, but I don't think you should do it.  The decision, however, was later reversed by the Court of Arbitration for Sports.  After much study, it was determined that Pistorius' prosthetics did not, in fact, offer him an unfair advantage, which cleared the way for him to compete in the 2008 Games.  I don't know about that.  I don't know about that neither.  But I don't, I don't know.  After designing those, uh, those fucking spatula feet, didn't they design them?  They did much study, it says. 
[00:36:30]  Much study.  How much fucking study did you do?  Yeah, I didn't do anything.  I just looked and said, that looks fucking fast.  Let me go.  I don't know.  I don't know, but that looks like fucking.  Let me go to Mike in Ohio.  I'd say fuck this guy.  It just doesn't seem like a fair.  What do we know about this guy?  You don't think he answered a lot of research?  No.  I see this picture.  That's all the research I need.  He's got fucking spatula feet.  Fuck this guy.  Spatula feet, he's fast.  Mike in Ohio.  Mikey.  Yeah, I'm a college track coach, so I kind of follow this guy's story a little bit.  Oh, pretty.  Yeah, he runs for South Africa. 
[00:37:00]  He's their best 400-meter runner.  Obviously.  So, yeah, he's a beast.  And he runs at about 46 seconds, about two seconds slower than probably what the winner  of the Olympics will do.  Oh.  Oh, so he's not even going to medal?  Ah, let him in.  No, he won't medal.  Well, he doesn't medal his legs, so to speak.  He's got enough medal already.  Yeah, he's medaled.  Yeah, he's still better than Danny's best 400 runner, so, you know, or some of those  other players.  All right, but.  So he's still two seconds behind the world-class runners? 
[00:37:30]  Exactly.  The rest of the world-class runners, I should say.  Yeah.  And he doesn't slip because he's got spikes put into the front of those pedals.  Oh, man.  And there's, like, spikes actually in it.  So he's got, like, spikes he throws on for actual races.  He's got spikes for training, and he's got all kinds of different shit.  He's stomping on people.  It's pretty fucking impressive.  Yeah.  And he'll get some endorsements out of it.  Yeah.  He's going to do very well.  Quite amazing.  You see him kind of wobbling around. 
[00:38:00]  He's not very efficient, but he gets the job done.  All right.  Well, thank you for your knowledge there, Mike.  It was absolutely terrific.  It says that he beat the qualifying Olympic standard time of 45.3 seconds for the 400.  But apparently he's been having trouble doing it again.  Oh, boy.  It says at the pre-Fontaine Classics last weekend, or probably not.  All right.  Maybe he needs a little Earl.  Yeah.  He did not beat the qualifying standard.  I'll let him in then.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  He's a bum. 
[00:38:30]  He's a bum, and he's lazy, and he left his leg somewhere.  He's a bum.  Bum.  You're a bum.  You are a bum.  I only want hard workers in the Olympics, not this lazy bum.  Oh, while everybody else is working out, he's highfalutin' with his fancy feet.  We don't need your kind around here. 
[00:39:00]  Thanks for nothing, bum.  Poor gentleman.  Poor gentleman, yeah.  Poor gentleman to drink.  Glug, glug, glug.  Let him think about his own legs, bum.  He could do something else, you know?  Like what?  How about a little mix of martial arts?  I don't think so.  Oh, that would hurt.  Oh, God.  It would hurt.  Spike spatula to the fucking face.  One fucking...  He didn't lose these legs in Christ.  That's some kind of nasty accident, either.  What happened?  He's happy he was sick of them?  He chopped them off for an unfair advantage. 
[00:39:30]  That would be twisted.  They were slowing him up.  Yeah.  Coincidental.  Two bear traps.  Coincidental?  Yeah, he's playing hopscotch in fucking Vietnam.  Somewhere more topical, stupid.  Vietnam.  Where else was he playing hopscotch?  The War of 1812?  Fucking asshole.  It's not even a place.  I know.  That's the point.  Where was the War of 1812?  That's hilarious.  I think...  Well, it says he was born with a congenital disorder that resulted in... 
[00:40:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  Poor penis.  Oh, boy.  His penis scrapes the ground so we had to have longer legs put on.  He has black-eye-itis.  The giant penis get it.  Too good.  Too fucking good.  Well, anyway, he was born with missing fibulas.  Oh, wow.  What?  At least he told the truth.  How does that happen?  You're missing your fibulas?  Hang on.  This is what's weird.  Fibulas.  He was born with the missing fibulas, but he didn't have his double amputation until he 
[00:40:30]  was 11 months old.  Oh, wow.  So from being a baby to 11 months, you just had these noodle legs, I guess?  What is a fibula?  Tibias.  It's one of the two bones.  Yeah, it's one of your leg bones.  Yeah, I guess you...  But you gotta wait till the kids a little longer.  Is that your shin bone or the one, like, behind it?  There's the tibia and the fibula.  Yeah.  The tibia and the fibula.  I'm gonna go with the back one.  I think the fibula's the back one, right?  No?  The tibia is the shin bone? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, the...  So you didn't have a fibula, so that's the one behind it.  Behind it.  We could put a bone behind the other bone.  I don't have a brother coming out with just cartilage in his head.  Ah, yes.  It's that one.  You need a fibula?  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's that backing bone, I guess.  Because the tibia is the bigger one.  It is the back one, right?  You would think, you know, they could figure that out.  Maybe put some fucking metal rod in there or something.  God, he must have had a real achy calf. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, it just must have hurt.  Without having a fiblia.  A fiblia.  A fiblia.  A fiblia.  Oh, that sucks when you're just born without shit.  Whoops.  Defect.  Whoops.  Wow.  Poor bastard.  I'm missing half my thumb.  It sucks.  Poor bastard.  All right.  I guess Cat Williams got something on this.  Sean on Long Island.  Sean.  Sean A.  Hi.  How you doing, guys?  Hi.  Maybe we go to break with this.  Maybe you're picking the bit we go to break with right now. 
[00:42:00]  Go ahead, Sean.  Yeah.  It doesn't really need a setup, so you can go right into break with it.  Cat Williams does a bit.  When the guy got disqualified in 2007, he talks about the other runners making fun of  him, so it's pretty good.  Oh, wow.  So this guy's been around a while.  Yeah.  If you had a caller said he got disqualified in 2007, now they're reversing the rule on  him.  All right.  You got the Cat Williams bit there, Iraq.  What's the skid called?  No.  Tink, tink. 
[00:42:30]  What is it called?  Tink, tink.  Yeah.  Tink, tink.  Oh, tink, tink.  I so would not trust a fucking caller to say that there's a funny bit.  Well, Cat Williams is funny.  Yeah, but you know what?  I would never trust a caller because I've read shit on Twitter and said, Anthony, you've  got to check this out.  And then you click on it, and it's like, this stinks.  And it's 99% of the shit that people say is hilarious.  Yeah, give me one that happened recently.  What?  Oh, some guy played a bit. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  All right.  Someone sent me a link to a video of this very effeminate boy singing this horrible  auto-tune song that he wrote.  And it's terrible.  And I said, wow.  I just put, oh, Jesus, and retweeted it.  And then someone goes, you think that's funny?  Check this out.  And I clicked on it, and it's some guy doing something, and it was not even the least bit  funny.  And I'm like, I shouldn't have clicked on it.  I knew it would suck.  Yeah, but we're all hoping. 
[00:43:30]  People are horrible.  But we're all hoping it's going to be good.  Yeah, that's why you click.  That's the problem.  You have to click.  I know within two seconds, I'm like, this sucks.  You have to click.  All right.  Thank you, Cat Williams guy.  I don't know if, I think we've hit a dead end with you there, Sean.  Cat's a funny dude.  Cat's funny, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Yes, he is.  All right.  I hope so.  How long is this bit?  Three and a half.  Oh, boy.  I don't know if we can take a three and a half minute chance.  Oh, boy.  Want to start for a second and see how it is? 
[00:44:00]  I've never heard of this.  Let's see.  Let's listen and still stay here, and then we'll go to it.  Really?  All right.  Let's listen.  There's a white boy that ran track for a motherfucking living.  He ran track for a motherfucking living, and he lost both his motherfucking legs.  Now, I hate losers and quitters, but I feel like if you run for a motherfucking living  and you lose both of your motherfucking legs, you should be allowed to sit this motherfucker  out.  You have done everything there was for you to do, and this motherfucker on some gangster  shit decided not only is he going to walk again. 
[00:44:30]  Is that his thing, to say motherfucker a lot?  It's really annoying.  I think that's just his cadence.  He was, I believe, a pimp at one point.  He comes from a different place.  I think if you pepper it a little bit, it's fine, but he already said motherfucker ten times.  I think that's his thing, though.  Yeah, motherfucker.  I just honestly think that's how he talks.  He's a runner.  He ain't got no motherfucking legs.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And I want to point that out so it's really annoying to people now.  I've never seen him.  When you point it out, the obvious, it gets even more annoying. 
[00:45:00]  He has almost ten million views on this.  Wow.  So I guess we'll go to break with this.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  What else are we going to do?  Cat Williams.  All right.  Cat Williams, everybody.  He decide he's going to fucking race again.  Now, you got to be in tune with your fucking star player to pull this shit off, because  they made him some aluminum racing legs and shit look like bent back paper clips and shit.  Yes.  Don't try to act like something wrong with me.  Some of you motherfuckers saw the story.  You know what the fuck I'm talking about. 
[00:45:30]  It looked like bent back paper clips, like two baby boomerangs and shit.  That's what he had to run on.  That motherfucker had to be in tune with his star fucking player, because sometimes motherfuckers  ain't going to have your back like you think you should.  And this motherfucker now got to come in on his aluminum racing legs and race again.  And he got to try to come in and be all calm and smooth and not draw too much attention  to himself.  To...  Tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee. 
[00:46:00]  Motherfuckers fucking with him and shit.  Yeah.  You got to go over there and sign up first before you race.  Okay, motherfucker.  Tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee.  Yeah, they said I got to sign up first.  It's no sign up at all. 
[00:46:30]  Tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee.  He all at the starting line.  You know motherfuckers fucking with him, doing all sorts of unnecessary exercises with they  legs and shit.  Just on your mark.  Tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee, tee.  And the craziest fucking thing happened.  This motherfucker not only started running, this motherfucker started winning.  And you know a hater can't stand a goddamn winner. 
[00:47:00]  And the last place you want to be in a motherfucking foot race is behind the motherfucker with no  goddamn foots.  That's the last.  I bet that motherfucker's mad as shit.  my legs tired  ain't your legs tired  his legs ain't tired  he just  just paper clips and sparks everywhere 
[00:47:30]  just  but you gonna have to be in tune  with your star fucking player  cause these haters do not play fair  these hating ass motherfuckers  at the Olympic committee  let this motherfucker race  and then waited till he won  and then disqualified him  and said and I quote  he had an unfair advantage  are you talking about the motherfucker running with no god damn legs  is that who the fuck you talking about 
[00:48:00]  poor little tink tink  think about that  when you think you having a bad god damn day  poor little tink tink  ain't that a bitch  that's why you gonna have to be in tune  with your star fucking player  these motherfuckers want you to be missed  you're listening to the O.P. and Anthony channel  on Sirius XM  laugh your tears away

[00:54:00]  score oh yeah you don't think he pays his bills on time he's probably one of the only millionaires  with a 300 credit score did you want to pay him on time no if he didn't realize he had jury duty  until an hour and a half before he was supposed to be there then now he's busy you know he swims a lot  and he's he swims yeah he has a bad credit credit score we gotta ask if you're not paying your bills  yeah fuck i don't like doing automatic bill pay i won't oh my god i love it i won't do it i'm trying 
[00:54:30]  to get everything on automatic i don't like them having that kind of control over my fucking bank bank  money who gives a fuck signing i don't trust checks and fucking licking envelopes fuck all that  you don't have to do it anymore i do it i've had the same checks for probably four or five years  really yeah i go through a lot of checks the only check i write is my rent check really so you got  everything automatic well either automatic or i know to pay it online but what if you have a uh a  discrepancy or something i don't want i don't like anything i'll do my car payment automatically 
[00:55:00]  and my mortgage payment so when you say automatically do you mean you don't do anything  online or you don't do anything scheduled i do it on electronic okay i like i they send me a  bill a hard bill which i save and you pay it online and i pay it online i don't i don't let  them just let them take your money no oh god i do it i do online banking oh fuck that you don't do  take away payments no really no like my phone bill like i just have them fucking zap it yeah no  because there are some times where there's no money to pay but you know uh yeah now phone bill i'll do 
[00:55:30]  in my and my car payment a couple of things that i know are going to be very close credit cards  never because if you get fucked and someone gets your number no no no i'm not going to auto pay a  credit card no but never huh just like regular bills like you know like my cable my cable bill  phone cable you know shit that's maintenance charges every month my stupid garage thing  cables automatic cables automatic because because they forced me to do automatic because they give  me a discount oh that verizon like yeah what kind of discount yeah what like fucking dollar oh you  know what yeah you know what it was uh they waived the installation fee if you sign up oh that's so 
[00:56:00]  nice of them yeah i know they're just great people they don't want you being late guys cable  companies suck they're terrible they're the worst they're not good fios offers nothing just keeps  going up i saw that it was going up another twenty dollars the other month like that do they what  uh like what about i pay for free installation well i can i combine on my phone bill but yeah yeah  that's what you could do if you pay if you have like multiple verizon services you can combine  them onto one bill you save some money that's what i do they gave me back a lot of money i had 
[00:56:30]  like i overpaid by like 600 but verizon gave you money yeah time warner keeps taking money  time warner stinks they're the worst why are they raising their rates i don't know i noticed that  like my bill is usually like 130 and it was 150 last month and i called them up i said or did  rates go up they said yeah people were you gonna tell anybody people are watching less tv so why would  you be why would you raise your rates you want to talk about less tv my tv is about to it's on its  last legs like i i'm probably gonna need a new tv by the end of the month right and i'm i'm tv  you're debating right yeah and i'm like i'm like should i spend the money on a tv or should i just 
[00:57:00]  get some old piece of shit because do i what do i do it's just on right it's just on when was the  last time i sat down watched a fucking show and retained the information from it i can't tell you  we have no idea and the movie channels suck they just suck i i don't watch any movies those are the  biggest waste of money it really is because when you sit down you kind of have to have it because then  they take all the shit away if you try to drop your movie when you think about how much you're  spending for like showtime and hbo and cinemax and how much you're and how much you're actually  watching it i dumped those years ago maybe an hour a month maybe i hardly ever watch it two hours a 
[00:57:30]  month i don't know but it's a write-off i think for us because we talk about the work i mean it's  needed for that might be true but at the same time it's not like it's free you're still spending  that money so you know i've got to care less about it i order them it's still looks very expensive  to have that movie channel packages i'll order i'll order showtime when dexter comes on and then i'll  cancel it when dexter's gone that's smart yeah absolutely what what am i gonna pay  fifteen dollars a month for if i'm not watching the channel you're in that bracket huh or you're 
[00:58:00]  still juggling oh yeah i'm juggling right now i was there for many years you see all your bills  and you juggle them around absolutely oh well i can pay this and i'll wait on this here i'll pay  this a little late that's all right i know that game all too well i don't need i don't need super  troopers to come on at 4 p.m on a tuesday i don't give a fuck because i could just put it on whenever  so unless it's like like the only thing that it sucks that i can't watch is like shit like dexter like  game of thrones like i'm i'm lost but it eventually comes out on netflix anyway and if i really want  to watch it i can watch it yeah i'm not paying fucking twenty dollars for hbo hbo doesn't come 
[00:58:30]  on netflix or they don't come on uh itunes or one of the one of those you can still watch it if you  want to watch it how have a friend i guess i don't know how how the fuck you do that how the fuck you  want to let's go to chris on longer island who's saying he could have got anthony out of jury duty  oh i don't know who's chris uh chris is a regular he comes from time to time chris how how are you  how are you going to get anthony out of uh jury duty day up uh i can get him pulled from the room 
[00:59:00]  he just has to show up are you going to be in the room yourself no my mommy is your mommy can get anthony  pulled yeah my mommy's one of the head clerks over there yeah but you know she can do it she walks in  the room and picks you out you know what you know advance leaving the show i'm not giving you know  we're not giving him a day off you're gonna make him do the whole yeah so fuck he's not gonna come  back yeah exactly so you know what this is what i say goodbye now he's just gonna walk in there and  say i'm looking for chris's mom yeah chris's mom could have got anthony out of jury duty if he shows 
[00:59:30]  up but we know anthony's not coming back here so fuck him that's true all you'd be doing is giving  him a day off that's right yeah he's on his own now you guys uh you're not watching the nba but did  you see mayor menino you gotta you gotta pop the video up for uh for jimmy jimmy norton uh i'm not  even i'm scared of my sports curse so i don't want i don't even want to say anything about tonight's  game that's that's it what's the score in the series uh believe it or not a lot of people are 
[01:00:00]  very well i think a lot of people are surprised the celtics are leading three games to two over the  miami heat and the celtics are an older team but they certainly uh know how to fucking win uh games  and and this team's been around a while but uh rondo for the celtics is just lighting it up and  fucking carrying this team and it leads this video from our favorite mayor in the country mayor stupid  menino who uh you know they asked him about the celtics because it's a big deal up there obviously  and this is what he had to say he's very knowledgeable about the sport very knowledgeable 
[01:00:30]  speaking of history tell me your thoughts about the celtics and where they stand in history right now  well i stayed up too late last night um i think it's great i mean you know we're going to go to  the next game uh friday or thursday night and uh we'll see what happens i mean i just shows you  just because you got a few gray hairs doesn't mean you're over the hell you still got a lot of energy  what is it about these boston teams they're always trying to you know drive us around the bend make us  hang over the cliff well that's the way we are i mean we have uh what the celtics have is really uh 
[01:01:00]  they have a lot of uh experience they have great talent on the team and a mixture of their good  bench they have with the uh you know the top four they have and start with them and uh you go from  there and don't forget we're not playing with uh bradley either i mean that's uh he was a great  asset to that team and uh there's a lot of hat in this team let me just tell you uh uh kj is a great  but hondo's really the inspiration i mean hondo drives that team 
[01:01:30]  well there's there's no one named kj on the team i think he might be talking about kevin garnett  and uh it's not it's not hondo it's rondo he's just the worst and it's also just the easiest  answer to give the team has a lot of experience and heart they have a good he didn't say heart  he said hot hot hot the team has asked jim that and jim would have said the exact same thing 
[01:02:00]  without knowing anything about yeah but you're the mayor of exactly exactly he's a dumb motherfucker  he i don't know what is it he's obviously not dumb if they continue to elect him uh to be the  mayor of the city so what's that about he's like the guy cannot communicate yeah he's a bad talker  he just panics his fucking brain he's probably dyslexic maybe he's just a savant and he's just  really good at being a mayor i'm guessing he's dyslexic you think that's what it is  i'm guessing yeah because he's always talking about how his tongue used to be uh it has to be  way too big for his mouth or something that's part of it he doesn't he's a fat tongue zilch 
[01:02:30]  but he also does trip on thoughts that are beyond a big tongue and i really think that might be it  but you're right he might be a savant and just a good mayor like he might be but it's basic shit  if you're talking about the celtics you say kevin garnett and and you say rondo  maybe and maybe he's just great at balancing a budget he says kj and and and hondo kj uh  he's kj uh kj uh he probably wouldn't say kg kj uh he just uh he's like rolling when he talks he 
[01:03:00]  just he doesn't he panics on a mayor that's true like not even a booker but what happens  my point is that when you're campaigning and this this zilch is trying to communicate what he wants  to do for the city how as a voter are you going oh all right we got to vote for this guy  i guess he there's an affection they have for him the way we had for kach at one point but not to  that extreme there's an affection for him that boston must have and he also probably gets a lot done 
[01:03:30]  like i i can't say he's not an effective mayor i don't know i don't know if he is or not like i  don't like the fact that he got you guys fired i mean i do because you know i would thank god for  his fucking meaning i should love menino oh we were leaving boston no matter what you know  shitty my career would be if menino fucking thought it was funny what you guys did and  laughed it off i wouldn't be on we had job never leave we had major opportunities and i knew we  had to blow up that shit to move on to major opportunities we're now officially admitting  it that we uh became really bad boys to get the hell out of there even though i liked boston yeah 
[01:04:00]  you could have slept there no we couldn't we just signed a contract oops um yeah all right but  at this point the whole town is pointing and laughing at him yeah i think they've been doing  that for a while but now everyone's just all in they're like fuck this guy is just a  babbling idiot how many years has he been there 15 years or 20 years 93 93 all right 20 years we  went up there in uh 95 wow he's been the mayor for almost 20 years that's impossible right that's a long 
[01:04:30]  time let me say hi to john in north carolina john hey did that dude say uh we have a bunch of gray  hairs and we're not over the hill no yeah he was trying to say just give a few gray hairs doesn't  mean you're over the hill right but the celtics being old the celtics are an old team man they are  absolutely an old team he just said it like a fat-headed monster but that's what he meant  all right so that's uh that clip's going around today yeah if you wait he has me over the hill 
[01:05:00]  kg he just panics and his thoughts what happens was he he's not good at having linear thoughts come  out right like there's something that happens when he has like five thoughts this is like a waiting  room in your head where five thoughts will collect and all right go go now send each other out but  with him it's like there's a fucking fire and all the thoughts like it's my turn but go go and they  trip on his tongue they're piling up at the doorway great hair kg he's just a panicking idiot he's got 
[01:05:30]  that's his fucking big fat tongue there's nothing but thoughts running over it and out of his mouth  quickly just tripping over the tongue tripping over each other out of order right running rapidly out  of his face that's great eric and boss what's up eric hey what about the winter classic can you say  something about being a good ball game or something like that up here in ball first and well this does  lead to our uh our segment which we've done a million times but it's really worth playing a 
[01:06:00]  couple of other clips i think you like the winter classic one what's that you like the winter classic  uh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i think eric's running around trying to find our disc so maybe we'll actually  get back to work yeah he should stop fucking around actually eric's not running anywhere  are we kidding hi eric welcome oh hi we weren't talking about you all good here he comes i just  want to play the winter classic because that was just reference cool it's our gang hat it's pretty  cool wrestling shirt what track it's awful looks like a maori indian fucking tattoo that shirt stinks 
[01:06:30]  you don't like his wrestling shirt no why he loves wrestling shirts i know but hold on eric  please i gotta wow tyson i got it it's tyson but it's my tyson eye tattoo on a shirt right look at  me sweet potato not only that but he has this wrestlemania like hoodie thing that he was wearing  or like a jacket the other day yeah is that a is it a hoodie yeah so he's wearing and he's got this  hat too it's a it's a virus hat spread the virus that's probably it's got to be six years old at 
[01:07:00]  this point so the other day he's wearing a doctor who t-shirt with his wrestlemania hoodie  and his and his spread the virus hat and i just wanted to fucking shove his face through a  trailer door he's a pop culture mess what does the back of the shirt say uh his hall of fame  uh-huh is that is that a special shirt or something it's a special shirt they had it just for his  hall of fame induction what is your twitter name eric radio oh i'm gonna twitter this what were you  gonna say god damn eric so yeah jimmy just took a picture of eric's uh wonderful shirt here's 
[01:07:30]  menino talking about the winter classic up there in boston it is now my honor to pass this podium  over to mayor menino thank you  thank you very much  first of all can you pause that right right away big fucking big fucking lung head he can't help it  his head just goes right in so he has no he has no distance depth perception no you know 
[01:08:00]  fucking falls in the mic what a moron it might be his heavy tongue just pushing him forward  constantly yeah but listen to the volume difference like the one guy is like i'd like  to thank the mayor and here he is thank you all he just fucking blunders up to the fucking  good mic technique he's terrible and then mayor menino  thank you very much let me first of all thank uh commissioner bettman for the nfl nhl for 
[01:08:30]  having this very special event in america's most beloved ballpark  he said nfl ballpark well it is in a ballpark officially but yeah yeah all right beloved beloved  beloved beloved it might be it might be uh it doesn't exist anymore well yeah but it did when  this was said no it did no i'm really thrilled to host the uh 2010 winter classic on new year's day 
[01:09:00]  this is bringing new meaning to new year's day in the city of boston and uh before and after the  event does the nhl with the bruins and the red sox have many events for the people in boston  the bruins plus fenway park really equals a once-in-a-lifetime experience for our city  boston is a perfect fit for the world classic he's an idiot boston how do you fuck up you 
[01:09:30]  can't fuck up the two-syllable name of the city you've been running for 18 years you can't fuck  that up and we have a a few instances where he says boston how does boston here's another one  you can't fuck that up you can fuck up other things well usually when you mess up a word it's  because you're gonna say two words but it just comes out as one but there's no other word for  boston here he does it again that's what made we invite all of you here tonight  so that here in this theater we can talk about our commitment to the spirit of boston 
[01:10:00]  it's the spirit of community so we can talk about taking on the toughest challenges  of urban life and how we will solve them together he says nothing he says nothing of substance you  know we've done this bit so many times but i'll defend it every time i i could do this another  i can i can just sit here for an hour and play these again and we will and i we can just play  him again uh todd wants to defend uh the mayor he's but he says nothing of substance no of course not 
[01:10:30]  todd what's up buddy hey good morning from dc listen i i think i know why that bumbling idiot  said kj and hondo well hondo is uh i i want to interrupt just because i want to show a little knowledge  uh hondo was havilchek's uh nickname exactly 30 years ago yeah i know that kj is kevin johnson of  course years ago right yeah but he was definitely talking about current players you think or was he 
[01:11:00]  was he 20 years in the past oh maybe when no he was talking about how hondo is is just taking over  that team yeah i was under the impression he was talking about the current yeah of course of course  right so my point is he's probably 20 years you know living 20 years ago here so he's just an  idiot in a different way well no this is this is it he's an idiot but he's also making believe he  actually knows what's going on with the boston celtics because he's the mayor of boston he probably 
[01:11:30]  doesn't know shit about basketball doesn't give a fuck about it but if you're the mayor you got to  make believe you're all in because he starts out like i'm tired because i stayed up late for the  game i i bet you he didn't stay up late for the game and he he couldn't name five players on the  team because in the end he doesn't care about basketball he couldn't name two of them yeah  exactly exactly can someone i'm sorry thank you buddy any speech people out there like why would  he say boston how like what is happening in his fucking big dopey gargoyle head let's get big 
[01:12:00]  guy on the phone figure this out how big yeah well i'm just gonna play some  listen to this one his friend has alcoholism or something i was on berkeley street one day  who was in the street begging the guy he played trials with because he turned into alcoholism  what did he say i don't know i guess an old friend of his is uh oh he does it again here  we're we're just going with uh bofferson listen to this i'm really thrilled to host the uh 2010

[01:15:00]  have and start with them and uh go from there and don't forget when i played with uh bradley  either i mean that's uh he was a great asset to that team and uh there's a lot of hat in this team  let me just tell you uh uh kj is a great hat but hondo's really the inspiration i mean hondo drives  that team hondo's the inspiration hondo drives everyone oh it's rondo he's lighting it up man  rondo he's stupid he's just a stupid guy i'm sorry he's a dumb guy enough with the verbal fucking 
[01:15:30]  well everyone's saying he's a drunk peter griffin but i i he's not a drunk is he a drunk peter  griffin is peter griffin yeah that's what this guy's saying but i think uh yeah family guy kind  of had menino in mind when they but what is it i just don't get what how can you make that many  how can you say boffiston i don't know how you do that accidentally but i mean a lot  how do you say when you're the mayor of boston boffiston well you probably mispronounce your own 
[01:16:00]  name a lot right yeah hi i'm jur i'll wait you want to do more of these i know we've done it a  million times yeah i'm waiting for anthony anthony said he would call from the car but we could cover  some other stuff yeah we will certainly we'll cover other stuff and we got kevin pollock coming in today  and we got uh jamie hector yes who's promoting the wire paintball thing this saturday morning  i'm heartbroken that is the official title of it the wire paintball thing yes but play paintball 
[01:16:30]  with the wire guys i'm fucking heartbroken i can't do it that would uh be good on a t-shirt i was  thinking of something else sorry i was thinking of the wire the musical did you guys see that yeah i  saw the link to that video i watched it you liked it wasn't a good musical no but it made me  getting a lot of attention though not myself what i'm just i don't know how to enjoy things i covered  that in therapy yesterday and i'm just really having doubt why don't you enjoy things i i live 
[01:17:00]  yesterday or tomorrow i do not live but in the moment here's my first thought when i heard the  wire i want i don't even like to watch things like that like i've never seen the osbornes tv show  the whole series i've seen the moments why i'm weird um no but why there's a reason i don't know  you didn't want to see ozzy like that no no no i love ozzy no uh like when i first heard that it  becomes overwhelming to think about like when i the first thing i thought was the wire and i was  watching and it said the players theater that's right next to the comedy cellar my first my first  thought like i couldn't enjoy it was why wasn't i there why didn't i get to go and say hi like like 
[01:17:30]  immediately an idiotic thought yeah and i caught myself i'm like you fucking idiot and i watched it  it was very funny it was very enjoyable it was uh michael k williams uh as omar of course was  singing very funny snoop had a short appearance but it was a guy playing mcnulty which was also  really funny uh d'angelo from from seasons one and two uh d'angelo was the one that was hung right  uh no he was oh he was oh yeah you're absolutely yes he was choked in jail he was choked um spoiler 
[01:18:00]  it's been 10 years i still haven't come on well you'll have to you won't remember that was an  amazing everyone was like i want to kill him i watched the first episode and i thought that it  went very slowly and i just never got back into oh yeah it's just that was an introduction pilot no  i know i know it's it you gotta give it a chance man you really there's nobody that's ever told me  i don't watch that so is this worth playing the wire the musical oh no it's too long it's three and a  half minutes and plus it wouldn't make sense um some of it's funny but it's you have to watch it 
[01:18:30]  who's got it funny or die yeah yeah it's a funny or die clip yeah and by the way and but i was in  therapy yesterday talking about how i don't enjoy anything in the moment i it's all fucking  i'm not i gotta be present that's why my acting suffers like when i'm when i'm present i'm really  good when i'm not i'm not it's hard to be fucking present you gotta you gotta kind of enjoy the  journey man yeah you're always looking at where this all leads to yeah instead of enjoying you know  the ride yeah because in the end the you know the destination is like whatever you realize that 
[01:19:00]  but you don't realize it was so cool until it's over yeah exactly you look back on it and like a  lot of times i used to go out with girls and i wouldn't fuck them i would just build up enough  stuff to jerk off too later like i was crazy wow like that's what i would do build up enough shit  to fucking jerk off too late sorry are you enjoying yourself right now  in the moment what are you thinking what are you thinking about right now i'm trying 10 o'clock  no i'm kidding no i'm actually looking forward to jamie coming i'm happy he's coming but for what 
[01:19:30]  reason because i really do like the guy and uh i i love the you know i love the fact that one of my  favorite tv characters is actually a nice guy and i like the fact that he's a fun guy to talk to and  that i can do something to help his charity it's weird it's like you know you don't always get a  chance like people out there don't always get a chance a guy you love or admire professionally  to do something to help that person it's like they entertain me and say hey i can do something  to help his fucking cause it's right i'm glad i can do that well there you go but i don't live in 
[01:20:00]  the present you want to find out what's wrong with the the mayor i would like to yeah since i'm opening  up i might as well go back to menino but yeah i would like to find out what the fucking thing is  thanks for sharing joe yeah thank you welcome let's go to steamer in dc steamer hey good morning guys  hi hey buddy hey well the mayor is suffering from a rare disease called boss itis i couldn't hear  you dude the mayor i heard you 
[01:20:30]  wow it's rare somebody walks in like that fucking dudley do right chin out that was very satisfying  just some more clips okay and that's so important to me as a city as mayor but also to the city of  boston he's just awful he really is 
[01:21:00]  now it's my pleasure to induce our senior senator  induce i don't even know what he's saying and deuce he's inducing the senior senator you uh are you  gonna make any bets with the mayor at oakland oh yeah i mean uh uh uh he'll he'll probably um  give us a spaceship for uh jerry brown you know jerry brown a spaceship versus some uh good uh seafood 
[01:21:30]  all right he's a horrible on his toes communicator he's a terrible thinker i mean a terrible  improver i wonder if he like is he good at paul is he good against it is he just a prodigy as a good  mayor he must be is he or do you yeah there's no way that that somebody would stay in office for 20  years if they weren't good maybe the city's corrupt that that could also be it look i've i fuck up some 
[01:22:00]  words on this show but this is this is like beyond what i fucking do holy fuck you're not the mayor  either exactly like you're not an elected official who's making budget decisions exactly you're just a  guy with a nice little belly let's say hi i was showing anthony hey how does this sound i'm on my  hands-free escalate phone oh it sounds good it actually sounds very good oh goody goody gumdrops 
[01:22:30]  you missed the latest uh mayor menino clip that's going around today i've been listening to the program  on my uh drive in traffic are you are you uh are you a faithful listener of the show i'm a faithful  listener i pretty much listen every day oh that's nice nice how long have you been listening for  uh since you guys started  great i love the show how's traffic uh well i just uh hit dead stop there i'm dead stop not moving on 
[01:23:00]  the long island expressway because it's eastbound you know and uh it's you're not even rush hour but  well that makes total sense right i hate this gurg i gotta uh by the way i am definitely going to  try to talk to chris's mom when i get to the fuck fuck fuck i heard that shit fuck i figured if you 
[01:23:30]  aren't coming back why should we help you i know exactly you wouldn't help me but but you set it on  the radio i know are you just gonna show up and go hey uh anyone know uh chris's mom is what you  ought to do is just point to every woman's crotch and go hey did a guy named chris fall out of that  damn it i'm sure i could get you the info if you really need it if you really want to find chris's  mom i believe she's the one with the big tits yeah 
[01:24:00]  of course it's that great escalated uh hands-free thing but it was it was going nice we had a little  thing going there all right maybe i will call back why don't we take a break um he's known as  mumbling mayor menino we know yeah we know that but why does his fucking brain know that  uh let's see he's trying not to stutter is that what that's about boss uh skyler wyoming what's up 
[01:24:30]  buddy hey morning boys hey hey when i when i was in elementary school i had the same problem he did  uh my thoughts worked too fast for my mouth so i would slow down and think about it but when it  came out it came out much together but i wasn't stuttering so i thought i was uh winning to look  like a great asshole like he is so he's trying really hard not to sound like a complete idiot  but it comes down even worse so will he stutter if he doesn't do that yes if he just starts talking  like a normal human being he will stutter and once in a while when i get excited or nervous i i do it 
[01:25:00]  like right now i'm trying really hard i'm better talking to you guys but talk quicker talk quicker  yeah i can't talk to you but fucking quicker it's it it's hard wow is that you really stuttering or you  just do that for us i'm i'm extremely nervous talking to uh little jimmy norton so i'm trying  well come on talk quicker come on man you're losing me talk quicker  stop it sorry sorry sorry are you playing no i'm bad i've had this problem since i was six years old 
[01:25:30]  how great is that you can make someone stutter i fucking love that it's rules what i talk normally  again or whatever you do to not stutter okay hi my name is gather how are you guys doing good thank  you how long have you been a fan of mine quickly quickly quickly 16 years okay good you got that  quick hey by the way the stutter they're saying that the guy the fucking guy from america's got  talent lied about his fucking uh singing he said he used to stutter he got an injury in iraq did you 
[01:26:00]  hear that the guy yeah yeah the big uh also some domestic violence charge or something but he they're  saying he lied about his injury and that that's not why he uh is a good singer he never got hurt  in iraq because he was saying that he got hurt and it caused a stutter right and then from that he  learned he could sing because the only way he can't stutter is to sing i've never heard of an injury  causing a stutter i've never heard of that either and i can't sing to save my life so i don't know if  that i've tried to sing but it doesn't help to stutter at all if i start singing and get excited i just 
[01:26:30]  like a much mouth idiot well mel tillis could start singing not stuttering yeah i can't sing at all  and i can't sing without stuttering so can you try to sing something what would you sing if uh if you  could uh  yeah i can't i can't do it  yeah thanks for calling but i appreciate it thank you uh skylar very nice you turned the you turned  it all around for yourself there i was called wrong so i turned the heat off all right skyler 
[01:27:00]  you okay temperature wise yeah now it feels better right yeah i was freezing before yeah  i don't want that  fucking dumb dvd well it's one of the great traditions of boston st patrick's day breakfast  and uh jackie has done a great job for the first time ever everybody said he couldn't do it well he's  rose into the to the uh to the occasion again and uh he's just done a great job and you know  the governor and jen o'brien they're all been good good morning great jokes and uh great time 
[01:27:30]  wow that's that's a stutter that's trying to come out almost sounded like he's got a technique  and he's stopping his stutter and uh yeah he sounded extra tired there so  maybe it's even tougher when he's tired like when he feels it  he stops there's something he might do  the boston public health commission has also created an emergency preparedness guide called  live learn prepare it's live you fuck that just doesn't explain 
[01:28:00]  live what a no context idiot how do you look at that and go  we're not correct yourself oh my god yes he's saying you realize it's the wrong word  he really cared about what he said he wasn't just saying the words like a lot of elected  officials or far more elected officials would do uh he was a man of a great great statue in our city  great statue wow one more one more we shouldn't be talking about the settlement i mean settlement 
[01:28:30]  is money monetary probably it's more important to think about the family i i have no idea something  more important to think about the no idea all right uh uh we'll take a break well hold on  ron has gifts for us what do you have oh what do you got today roland i threw the stuff you gave me  oh yesterday away the anthony bourdain thing you can give my layover was pretty good i like the show  we should have had these signed the other day though yeah they came in late yeah i didn't mind layover 
[01:29:00]  what is it it's him uh you know in cities  things you could do if you're if you have a layover but most people don't have a layover for  48 hours like he did a 48 hour layover why don't you just call it two day trip  what the fuck is that yeah this should be called a two day no one has a 48 hour layover well some  are 40s some is 10 some no i had oh i had a problem with the concept of the show he's he obviously did  cool shit in singapore new york rome miami hong kong montreal amsterdam san francisco l.a and london but i i 
[01:29:30]  i watched this show and i was like it's not a layover and that's a not a it's not a layover  situation that's a cool that's a cool idea if you have a fucking producer doing advanced work for you  right if you just land somewhere in singapore you got four hours you're gonna leave the airport  come back and lose and go through international customs again no i went and had singapore thai food  i could have just eaten at the airport better yeah singapore i think he did have a 48 hour layover  yeah but you're not you're not going to have a layover in new york where you could actually see 
[01:30:00]  anything no ever no by the time hey hey i whisked on into the city go up to the empire state building  had a little meal took a picture went back out in the plane did you really what you have a week  fucking traffic on the la what time did your flight land right fucking two in the morning and then you  had to get back on by five in the morning when there was no traffic it's impossible it's an  impossibility all the city airports it's easily an hour ease into the city to get to manhattan unless  your helicopter and then you got an hour back out here's what he should say you got to guarantee 
[01:30:30]  there's no tunnel traffic it's impossible i had a two-hour layover so i uh left uh jfk rode around  queens for five minutes and then went back to customs there's your fucking layover story there's your  stupid show but we like anthony bourdain and this show was good it was on the travel channel i did watch  i wanted to argue with him about that sort of thing we did we pushed back a little bit you just  don't want the government telling you what to fucking do yeah but i do like i do kind of like  him i mean obviously there's an issue but it just seems like there's another way to figure out a 
[01:31:00]  solution than telling people they can't drink a lot of soda but i like the fact that he called himself  out he goes here's what i'm about to be a big hypocrite yeah and he called himself yeah i kind of  enjoy that what else you got rolling that's it um that's in the breaking bad box sets later on how  many seasons is that that's a show i never got into and i like those guys when they came in  in and obviously bill burr is in it so i would love to watch it for bill you should watch it  it starts again in july really and hopefully they'll come back huh they're coming back you  have about you you you have just enough time to go through every uh everything it really is that 
[01:31:30]  good you should watch it it's great because i started madman i've only watched three they were  decent yeah same thing i watched the first three madmen and it's it's okay you didn't understand the  hype a lot of people are talking about men i've read that that some people absolutely love it and  some people just don't get it and i might be one of those people that that that just don't get it  i show it's weird what grab like the wire didn't grab you the first time you got to give it give it  but i will give it i will give it because there's too many reports of amazingness from about it exactly 
[01:32:00]  but like game of thrones just got me when i saw the fucking pilot like boardwalk empire didn't  get me right away i had to watch a couple of those and the fucking and and and i love michael k  hey waiting so much i i made myself watch it i love buscemi that's what breaking bad did like  the the pilot and i was i was hooked we watched like five the first night really yeah i gotta  check that show out yeah great i went through the entire series of breaking bad and probably like  three weeks see everyone loves it so much i should give it another chance because i didn't i like the 
[01:32:30]  episodes i saw hey yeah go ahead sorry um especially if they're gonna come in yeah i guess i will  can we get them together that'd be great walking dead got me from the pilot yeah lost got me from  the pilot like i i i fucking thought the lost pilot was fucking amazing one of the best pilots ever  seen when do we get the box set um today when do i get one yeah let's go i'm rolling how many  seasons are in the box is it five you got the first three so this is the fourth one so you 
[01:33:00]  the fourth do i have the first three i gave you the first three last time oh do i have the first  three you all three should have okay i'm sure i have it where's mine  it's uh i'll read to your house first yeah i don't know if i have it in my house anymore  i saw one of them in the restaurant the guy i didn't recognize him the guy who plays the kid  well you obviously recognize jesse oh jesse at first i knew i came over and we said hello  aaron paul i'm like we said hi and then i realized who he was oh bloomberg's going after the food carts  the food carts now making them smaller why because he's a douche what's the problem with that what could 
[01:33:30]  possibly be the problem with that people have figured out to get a little small business for  themselves yeah of course the stupid billionaire mayor has to step in probably because the you  know the city's not getting enough of their take because he's a fucking what a piece of  he's a douchebag billy 22 billion dollars people talk about out-of-touch politicians he's worth 22  fucking billion he spent a hundred million to get a third term which he never should have been allowed  to get everybody calls giuliani a fascist where where is this guy did he hang up i want to go to 
[01:34:00]  you yeah what's he doing with the carts do i heard he's trying to make them shorter yeah but  why is that is it too long they they want them to be i think 10 feet across instead of 14 feet or  something like that like for what i read that quickly like those really big trucks they're not  that big i i love them they're my neighborhood they're cool it's a it's a nice small business  you know the food cart business has taken off in a lot of cities  why why is he going after these small businesses because the city's not getting their take 
[01:34:30]  i'm sure he's just a douche i'm sure that's what it's about uh you know what um mayor menino  someone said he got sworn in in 1993 we got the clip so it started with this this clip's almost 20  years old you want to hear it yeah yeah yeah so this is him being sworn in as mayor in 1993  first of all congratulate the uh city councilors on being re-elected and also to our newest  councilors arroyo and presley thank you for taking on this job of being a city council to represent

[01:43:30]  know it's pretty good i haven't had to do jury duty in 15 years i'll brag about it i always get  out of it so how do you get out of it because i just said we we got people i see i know people  i understand and i don't call in many favors but i don't want to deal with that jury duty  shit so i think i'm good for another three years i've been away i would actually i will do it i'll have  to do it eventually but i've just been gone yeah i've been lucky i've gotten those things in the mail  and uh when i was in queens i would just some i just blow them off all the time and nothing ever 
[01:44:00]  happened yeah and now i'm out in long island and i got one of those things and it seemed unavoidable  but all i had to do was call and i i called and they never picked my number so i'm running on like  since i'm 18 so 13 years jury duty free wow nice yeah i'm on a nice run i've never blown it off though  it scares me to blow it off like i've always called somebody or talked to somebody you blow it off until  you get the letter that aunt got no final notice right 30 days in jail thousand dollar fine  we'll take your gun away rape you with a stick it really gets ugly so aunt ran out of here wow  they're not he ran out here they're not fucking around i think here's what loses pistol permits 
[01:44:30]  because he's like when you got a gun permit you can't fuck around with any type of legal action  right yeah i get the letter and half the people you talk to say just rip it up yeah and i  ignore it they can't keep track of everybody i can't i can't do the computer of course they can  they can keep track of fucking stars exactly but do you have those do you have those friends  yeah yeah fuck it just rip it up they won't even notice like it's 1905 and it's hoover doing it  yeah all you have to do is go in there and do a christopher walken impression or something like 
[01:45:00]  all right excuse me your honor right those are nice balls you got some sweet nuts  sir i'd like to sit down if i can wow yeah they don't give a shit about that they really don't give  a shit they uh you can drive them nuts with impressions and i get that face though that  face recognition thing every day how you doing you know and they still don't care and then i  did it like three years ago or something where i got your dude i went in and you're sitting around  you're waiting to be called and i'm there a couple hours you know you bring a book whatever you you 
[01:45:30]  know you can bring a computer now you just sit there so i went up to the window and i said yeah do you  have any idea i don't you go i know you and then she said get out of here and signed the thing and  let me go that was nice right so then so this year when i went in like three weeks ago i walked up to  the window and said how you doing gave him the face nothing sit down go sit down well you should  have hinted you should have said i understand you're looking for a few good men listen i was i  was in a casino yeah right and i just got here listen if i can help find a couple usual suspects 
[01:46:00]  i'm happy to do it but i tweeted that i was going to jury do it and everyone was quoting me uh lines from  a few of them oh were they of course they were you can't handle their toes yeah i watched that  again recently since obnoxious we've met each other no you're really good in it though man  well it's aaron sorkin it's kind of tough to fuck that up no i could be honest with you you could  yeah how do you relax when you act this is what i like i was talking earlier about like it's hard  for me to relax and be present like in the moment which is uh you know like that's all it is it's 
[01:46:30]  hard to be present in the moment that's the whole thing that's by the way that's all i can do i  don't really know that i can act i can just be loose in front of the camera now you can and  comfortable but that's my technique is just be fucking real right and guess what it'll everyone  says you're a good actor do you read direction like if it says uh like if you had to play something  like the lawyer you played uh do you say okay i wanted to be this kind of guy or do you just not 
[01:47:00]  think of how you're going to deliver the line next oh no i definitely want to figure it out ahead  of time talk to the director and and uh get a beat on what their idea is yeah i mean i i people  say how did you prepare for this role i read the script a hundred times you know i don't drive if  i'm going to be a police officer i don't need to drive around police officers for six weeks and study  how they put their pistol in their holster you know what i mean because it's never about how to  be a cop you just happen to be a cop you're you're a but you're a guy first right you know you're just 
[01:47:30]  a guy who play the man not the uniform more importantly why are you kissing up to nasa today  i see the nasa hat yeah uh i am a fan of their work but uh yeah you know i like that whole rocket  shit thing they're doing that's pretty nice space shuttle uh yeah how about that you did you went down  there no no i just mean on uh on tv oh no i went down there did you it's pretty cool oh man i saw them  i almost saw them lowering it onto the intrepid almost but you saw it hanging there yeah i saw it hanging  there from my apartment i could see it holy shit and then i'm like you know what i want to go closer 
[01:48:00]  so i i put my son on the back of my bike and we went down there last night i get to sit in that  what i lied i just wanted to have attention for a second i got to clean it once it's and they're  going to cover it up so uh there's a pier just south of the intrepid literally right there and you  get a perfect view what do you think they'll cover it with you i think you were right no i am was  saying that i didn't even know they were covering no you said probably something with a nasa logo yeah i'm  sure some white fucking housing with a nasa logo on the side i'm excited now about this company 
[01:48:30]  spacex that just sent up the dragon rocket to uh dock with the uh international space station or  inner why are you excited is because now it's it's uh you know this guy is like the real tony stark  this uh elon musk he's got the tesla motors you know the electric car that actually looks  fucking cool really the first one that looks cool well the four-door sedan look it up i'm not  kidding you model s it's called is he the guy that's going to talk about colonizing or putting  people on the moon but they can't go where the apollos have landed is that the guy spacex 
[01:49:00]  well so that he's spacex now that's the roadster another put up the four that's cool that roadster's  cool but it looks like a lotus right this is the model s this is the game changer because it's four  door it's only 50 grand fully electric three hour fucking uh 300 mile range you know what that  looks all right it's badass your friends aren't gonna laugh at you if you get one of those how do you plug  it in how long does it take uh charge it overnight charge it overnight plug it into the wall see  that's they got the quick charge also you can do a 45 minute charge that's a long wait though if you 
[01:49:30]  got to go a long drive but this is great for city driving oh no that's just a get around town car  yeah you know yeah you got it but as a get around town car in los angeles especially you got one of  your whole fucking lives i got one on order i ordered one sure so are you driving an electric car right  now no i'm waiting for this oh so this will be your first yeah gotcha how fast it go so why did you  fast actually it's there's no uh combustion engine drag so it's actually quicker off the  line than a combustion engine it's a little freaky that way so and it's also silent which is look at 
[01:50:00]  that why did you finally decide to go electric because i saw this car oh literally that's it i  had elon musk the guy the the real tony stark on my uh chat show because he's a friend of the guy that  i that owns the building where i do the thing at and uh we talked like for an hour about spacex and  tesla and all this thing uh it's just fascinating dude he got all his money out of paypal or whatever  he's one of the starters of that oh wow yeah decide i need to go into space now yeah i know  that's scary it's pretty amazing though because they just launched this dragon rocket that actually 
[01:50:30]  went and docked with the space station and came back and landed safe it's like okay all right we  gotta know one of these yeah wow yeah and they're working on putting people on mars now but the key is  you won't come back they really are looking for volunteers they're going to have uh in 2023 they're  going to have three like pods or whatever to go and live there and then every two years they're  putting two new people it's a really weird thing they're doing they're beginning to colonize mars  they can't bring them back because they're going to fuck martians and they know that yeah they're  probably afraid of what you'll bring back from mars you can't why why can't they bring you back i don't 
[01:51:00]  know the technology doesn't exist i guess i mean or or i by that time it may i guarantee to launch from  their back to to build the thing that comes back with all the power and they will again would you  need power i'm sorry like when they got this they got the fucking uh the the apollo's back it's just  the gravity from mars can throw you back they would get a shitload of people to sign up to go to mars  and not come back i think so too pedophiles convicted murderers and rapists that's what we should say 
[01:51:30]  because they'd do the good work some of the hedge fund uh guys they would do the good work on  hedge fund guys hey uh did you see america's got talent there's a guy that's going viral today did  you see this kid no what the hell is this guy's dealer where's travis because he was going to help  us out with this is uh this is kind of a susan boyle situation and if you're doing one of these talent  shows you got to find the next susan boyle where you know the person looks like that and well the  person comes out of nowhere yeah exactly what would you assume he sings he looks like he's doing uh  sandler's opera man right right there there you go right yeah there's a little glam little goth 
[01:52:00]  glam thing glam slash goth thing happening with the guy yeah uh well let's play the clip and see  with where where this goes  we love it here in austin this is fun  we're waiting for that big talent big talent hey chris angel how you doing looks like chris  angel what's your name man andrew andrew what are you gonna do for us today i'm gonna sing you're gonna 
[01:52:30]  sing growing up i was a huge fan of maryland rob zombie and all these different rock stars  they really became an escape for someone like me who felt that i was an outsider  growing up i was alienated because i was never interested in athletics or what everybody else in  my family was interested in oh he's got the fucking eyebrows and black eyes comfort zone 
[01:53:00]  and the fake uh contact this is my first time singing in front of anybody  look like a zombie never sang in front of anyone before anybody i don't know if i believe that  yeah no way in this world they would be able to come up with a tape or somebody that would say  that is true that's well they might the fucking this guy the army guy they're nailing  just took a couple weeks right let's see if they fucking nail this guy in his pensive stare  i hate his good looks yeah they're setting this up to be a fucking huge win i know i do love the  i'm pretty so into the documentary about him 
[01:53:30]  he really is a fascinating guy yeah complex man deep he's deep he's a loner likes marilyn manson  zombie he's never sang live and also never masturbated which is a strange statistic so you  know they're setting you up to think like all right here comes this rock singer you know yeah  and it's working that's what i think yeah that's what you should think yeah of course i do they've  set me up and i've fallen manson you know you expect his hero to come out of him all right now  it's a huge step for someone like me who's never sang in public before never seen in front of even my 
[01:54:00]  family i think my days of being shy and being an outcast have reached their end and i'd like to be  able to really show what i can do give them what you got man all right i'm with you wow you go now  going on stage yes there's three x's  don't be nervous andrew what don't be nervous yeah oh he's creepy rough day at the office 
[01:54:30]  i know the feeling what's your name my name is andrew de leon andrew you've got an unusual look  but is this how you walk around all day yes kind of a goth look what you would describe this as  uh yes i i assume you're a singer yes well listen why don't you do your thing okay good luck thank you  up to the huge setup here we go finally that's quite the interview by the way yeah it's amazing 
[01:55:00]  that's why they're paying the big bucks  oh pause it yeah my stomach  that's why i love doing this go ahead what do you pick up on  what do you pick up the way they make it it's this is all the producers and the  they cut from sharon and from howie looking like what what is happening with this music 
[01:55:30]  what this is not what we expected yeah i am surprised but they just assume every viewer is  the dumbest person on earth so they have to force feed it to you yeah wouldn't you pick up on that  by yourself without all the reaction shots they did it with susan boyle too the what  someone is looking we're as kazoos as you are here's what you should feel yeah just wait for  the crowd shots there was no rehearsals we we didn't know who they were no one gave me a note or  anything about this kid i want to offer up a wager now how how long i'm going to put the over under at 
[01:56:00]  20 seconds before he starts singing and you cut to an audience member covering their mouth yeah i'm  gonna go 20 seconds and we want to go over under god less uh under five under five seconds i say  it's going to be i'll take ten the first thing they do reaction shots of the three yes they're  going to show him singing for five or six seconds they're going to show howard uh sharon and howie  looking in utter disbelief look at each other like what did you what the hey did you know this 
[01:56:30]  did she cover her heart did she and then an audience member covers her mouth i say 12 seconds  the audience member covers their mouth okay you said five and kevin said i said seven hope you  said i said 12. five seven and i want a hundred bucks if it's seven i'm ten right all right i have  a dollar i'll jerk the winner off one dollar i can't say dollar anymore all right so i guess we're  we're starting the time from when i hit play is that how this is from when he starts singing  we don't know what's going to come out of this kid's mouth i have no idea obviously he doesn't 
[01:57:00]  sing rock and roll we know that i could tell by the confused looks on the judges faces that something's  happening howie mandel looked around like whoa what's going on here yeah what the  pause howard starts with his hand out like what the yeah yes and and and and in the uh  the uh what's it instant what's it called when they write for the hearing impaired 
[01:57:30]  oh yeah yeah the closed caption it should say shocked look on judge's face shocked look on  shock jock's face yeah shocked jock okay well they're calling him a shock rocker oh how many  seconds oh you have a time i had to pause both okay it was like eight seconds why don't you just look  at why don't you go back to where uh yeah because i think we i think we fucked it up anyway with the uh  fucking sounds like dino all right here we go again let me start singing  thank you 
[01:58:00]  sharon first you can actually hear the judges going how are we looking around  oh  there's the audience but no cover the hand hold on oh good gravy 
[01:58:30]  i was wiping it she was crying she's reliving a rape she did not  pause that pause 35 wow i think the first one counts though i'm with kevin on that one no  it was a tear wipe she's crying i don't know why i say hand hand over the face counts 
[01:59:00]  where was where was the first one at though maybe she's like 25 yeah 23 seconds maybe she's never  seen a transgendered person sing we're so jaded the rest of america's going wow this is a really  nice moment for this kid and we're like oh we hate producers they have to over produce all this  i know but we're just we really just happen naturally exactly could you imagine how chilling  it would actually be if they didn't do all that production bullshit and this guy just starts singing 
[01:59:30]  right we would all do right they made it perfectly clear you're about to see something here that you  weren't expecting us though but don't forget most people might not read into it like that most people  really may have that reaction that they want yeah um well they trick you the other way on the show  where they set it up we're like oh we're gonna see a superstar and then it's some hack that sucks  yeah you know they go both ways with this crap well what the fuck get in here here's a homosexual  he sounds wrong with his eyes come look he's looking into my soul i don't even know if this 
[02:00:00]  is good why is she crying he ain't that good she's there's a few criers in the audience they go back  a few times they must be cutting from something else you think yeah showing them like puppy torture  videos exactly or they're just cutters they're just crying i'm showing him crying 
[02:00:30]  he's good still out there yeah and how many of these screaming idiots would actually pay to see  something like that i don't like this dumb teary face judges give a standing up he's never sang live  before so it's an emotional moment for him as well well even though they said that a million times  they're gonna have to tell you again now who does he look like in the face what woman  everyone's standing he's taking it in  what what's going through your mind can you share it with us um i'm just so used to being rejected 
[02:01:00]  and i'm not really good at anything so this is please say no he doesn't move on please cut him from  the show a lot of people tearing up in the audience i know another broad you're the ones rejecting him  you're feeling very nervous you ever perform in front of a big crowd like this i've never performed in  front of anybody no kidding this is your first time i mean literally you must have taken voice 
[02:01:30]  training or or something no at all self-taught you and and you would practice and yet you got up here  and blew the roof off the joint good for you thank you andrew what do your parents think of you  they don't know can you pause that um they've never heard me sing either let me guess what  his parents think but i'm gay

[02:09:30]  breakfast down gotta eat breakfast in like four minutes on the show yeah it is hard to shovel it  in kevin pollock really fast as jamie hector enters the studio he's got his um his uh uh walking  talking or talking walk i do this every time it's all right it's all right i like people being confused  because then they got to figure it out and go look for it talking walking talking walking on itunes  both words are spelled i-n so that his uh family can't sue me and it's just me rambling as christopher  walking for an hour with a friend over at the house talking about shit of life and is is it doing 
[02:10:00]  well yeah yeah you know how the comedy pack podcasts are you break into the top 100 and then you move  from the top 10 to the top 30 you know it's all over constantly fluctuating you put out a new episode  you shoot up the thing right right cool yeah talking walking on itunes kevin pollock's um uh  podcast there one of his podcasts he's got two of them hi jamie hey what's going on it's been a  while jamie yes it has a year no it was last year oh i guess it was the last time you're doing the  paintball thing yeah it was quick and uh do you do you guys know each other jamie and kevin i do 
[02:10:30]  having a kevin i know your work and i love your work oh thanks man indeed appreciate that you've  never worked together i guess not not yet no we will now we'll see you on the set yes sir yeah  i know i want to do a movie i i need some acting work all right somebody here please  they both have shit going on all right but you've got to get over that hole i can't relax and be  comfortable in front of the camera thing yeah i mean that does kind of hurt when you're like you  just ask all these people to leave the room yeah um i mean unless i can say to the director ahead of 
[02:11:00]  time look his sphincter is going to tighten a little bit when you say action but then maybe tell  them don't say action like clint eastwood doesn't say action i think he just says go you guys are quiet  just go yeah it is a great way of doing it and you've done some very serious that makes you  nervous yeah i panic i'm all relaxed action yeah i just up i have i need you do a humana  yeah i'm like john kazale i like to talk a little bit before we actually begin well that's what kazale  which is not a bad thing no and if the director knows that it probably let you do it every time 
[02:11:30]  you chit chat a little bit as the camera's rolling and then you just start with the dialogue that's right  it's funny i'm telling the technique yeah that's how that's how fredo did it and i'm telling  jamie hector and fucking kevin pollock how to act it's really good i'm a pompous idiot when is  the uh when is this paintball thing because me and anthony did it last year yes and it was  unbelievably fun where was i you were away i had something to do james that's right i would  have been there in a second i know you would have because the support that you guys provided  absolutely but i forgot what was going on it's paintball with the wire um and and last year it was 
[02:12:00]  of course uh uh jamie who was marlo and then uh michael k williams who was omar and uh jd williams  who i was gonna surprise you he was supposed to come in today but he didn't come we're supposed  to have bodie in today wow he was never gonna make it something came up he was he hit me this  morning and said he couldn't make it i would love to yeah meet bodie he was gonna come in he was  excited about it also but it was fun man we we played paintball with these guys and uh i never played  paintball in my life and it was actually it was a fucking it was a lot of fun to be shooting at each  other was he hit hard with those pellets was he the scariest character on the wire you think who 
[02:12:30]  uh jamie yeah um i was so intimidated the first time i met you because that character was just so  intense oh my goodness yeah now i could finally relax around you but i remember last year i'm like  that's fucking marlo yeah i think omar might have an ups on ups on me over there no the most  ruthless guy was you yeah without a doubt yeah he had that that human side to him you didn't have  that marlo didn't have that shit yeah that that's was uh that was the difference you could almost 
[02:13:00]  reason with omar yeah but you could reason with omar with a shotgun i know i don't know he got some  shit done i i get it yeah now you were you were by far the fright most frightening guy in the show  there was no there was no there was like we've talked about before there was almost a sociopathic  disconnect from anything anybody was right feeling and uh to play like because i get i'm such an ass to  play a character like that i would be so over the top but to watch the calm the calm it's the quiet 
[02:13:30]  calm that is the most creepy without question have you do you know do you know the role oh yeah have  you seen oh yeah no but it's the quiet that's the scariest way to play the villain you look silence  at lambs you look at all the great um most frightening characters from from fiction in film or tv  and it is that quietness it is not the intensity that scares the  fuck at it because if their heart rate can get lowered they're a true sociopath you know what  i mean and that's way more frightening to me and i believe it's based on something too oh i know i 
[02:14:00]  know jamie you're a good actor a great actor but i i also think there might be a little uh marlo  my best behavior right now that's one thing i don't do is put people in vacants  you know what you're saying is so true because the element of surprise in real life right i mean you  would never know if somebody was sitting next to you if they were going to kill you if they were  real good at it right you know but if they let you know you'd be prepared that element of surprise i  think is what really creeped everybody out because you really never knew what was going to happen next 
[02:14:30]  right when you look at i'm sorry dracula yeah uh christopher lee had like eight lines in some  of these dracula movies because he didn't like the dialogue so he wouldn't do he played it silent and  bella lugosi that was the most frightening stuff it's in the nature though like uh his bark is bigger than  his bite that old saying about a dog that's yappy and always screaming you can never be afraid of  that dog never but it's the one that just comes running at you with no sound yeah like what happened  to me when i was 12 years old no we're gonna need we're gonna need more of that story yeah what 
[02:15:00]  happened here since no you know a dog just yeah you didn't see it coming walking down the street and  he's walking mind this whole business yeah well i what kind of dog it was a german shepherd yeah yeah i'm with  you that's my number one that's my number one dog i i'm i'm i'm afraid of see i'm stammering oh you  know i'm way over pit bulls if i see a german shepherd to this day i get freaked out i got bit  down in the side of the knee uh on a paper route oh yeah this thing came out of nowhere and chased  me down on a bike that's what i'm talking about yeah and i'm scared to this day of german uh this day 
[02:15:30]  of german shepherds i'm scared of death of chihuahuas and little things got a mean bark it's like  you know they they don't like me but what happened with you with the german shepherd you're just walking  down the sidewalk and yeah you didn't see it coming no i saw it but you know it just didn't  seem like it was going to turn on me right it's just wow all of a sudden it's like i'm going to  school in the morning it just like jumped on me and you know try to bite me and i just fought my way  off of it but at the same time it was just like hey you know it's somewhat traumatizing where in new  york that'll stay with you it's there um i always hated those stories that said yeah we had to put the 
[02:16:00]  dog down what yeah he turns on somebody turned that's his job just became a crazy animal yeah well  drug dealers cut the vocal cords out of them they have a lot of the guys when the pit bulls would  guard stash houses they have them with no no ability to make noise and i forget how they have  it surgically done but they attack people silently when they come in and also the barking won't alert  people that something's going on i learned that for the first time the other day i was shadowing a 
[02:16:30]  detective and they took me on a on a on a sting where they basically went to go and arrest somebody and  a warrant operation and they said they looked through the window and they saw dog food  and then they they made noise to see if the dog would come out and they were very careful because  they said they usually take the voice out of the dog and i never knew that i never knew that yeah  until they said that and i was like wow that's that's torture i couldn't even see how you can do  something like that did you see it though no the dog without the voice it wasn't there but they were 
[02:17:00]  like creeping on you know basically climbing through the window and going through the front door just  making sure the dog wasn't hidden behind a bin or something like that why were you shadowing  detectives i'm working on a film called blood ties and i'm playing the detective so a friend  of mine's the detective and he allowed me to stick around with him for two weeks oh so you're one  of the we were just talking about that guys that do kevin says he doesn't need to do that  he doesn't do that it's not me you're just saying it's not a matter of need it's that that's  not kevin said only bad actors do that yeah  you know uh i never gained anything from uh anything other than what's in the script 
[02:17:30]  you know in terms of research but i do read the script like a hundred times excessively  because that's the story that's being told to me right so if in the script it said there are 37  shots in the film uh with you driving around in a with as a detective in a car then it might make  sense to see what they actually look like sitting in a car but i think i kind of know that you know 
[02:18:00]  it's never about how to my point was that it was never about how to be a police officer it was about  who the fuck is this guy yeah what is going on in his head and uh i i would rather interview these  guys and talk to them a little bit about the shit that goes down on the job than drive around with  them yeah and that was what um i had the opportunity to do but something that kevin does is  you've read the script a hundred times which is that right there feeds you in itself i know every  nook and cranny of the story see i look at it when i get there you know a lot of times i'm like you 
[02:18:30]  know i have a little sex addiction to take care of when i'm home waste time on the script you're not  paying me to be off the clock you like to say let's let's get this over with yeah yeah yeah i'm  like come on let's go let's go let's go time's a waste yeah and i always try to cheat i hold the script  on my lap if i can i always want to get my scenes sitting yeah should be from the waist up like  brando so you went on this uh what else did you see in this two week uh you probably see a lot of  your shadow somebody for two weeks yeah i mean i learned a lot you know but what do you see anything  really cool well okay let me think okay guns it took me in the archive with all the guns i mean gold 
[02:19:00]  guns green guns ak-47s and all of that and i was like wow and then um also on that run also early in  the morning 6 a.m what do you pick up when you're with a guy like that he's a detective this is what  he does what is it you learn as an actor like all right this is how these guys move and this is what  these guys do that nobody sees one thing i learned about all of them they're very calm they never get  excited sense of uh of uh belonging and sense of belonging and and and uh control over their 
[02:19:30]  environment over their situation very much so yeah and they're always cracking jokes whether the joke  is funny and not funny but they're always laughing the gallows humor because the next step you never  know what it's going to be you never know if you run in this house and somebody's going to do something  your boy's going to drop a friend is going to drop or whatever and you know the um you sees and the  terminology also you the terminology is different right right right you know if somebody says like  the 71 or something like that then it's just like that's different from me i would say the 71st you know 
[02:20:00]  and but really the fact that they're just so calm and relaxed under stressful situations and you see  everything happening but they're just like you know okay and they work from the end first you know they  have to get the body or they have to get the gun and then they work from that point to catching me  you know all these things i didn't know do you watch first 48 yeah yeah that's actually a pretty good  show it's an amazing it's a sad show i mean yeah it's a you know it because it's real you would hope that 
[02:20:30]  it wasn't real right and when you watch it it's like damn another one bites the dust you realize  how people fall for fucking techniques too like we always think we wouldn't fall for the detective  is putting on you but yeah you think they have the upper hand every time oh my god of course you  would think that when you step into the room you said give me a lawyer right immediately you know  because you watch the first 48 but when you're under the sticks it's just like look just get me out of  here do you know who's doing the paintball thing too uh the guy who played leaving michael kostroff really yeah who 
[02:21:00]  i thought was just repulsive he's a great actor but what a repulsive character yeah is those  fucking lawyers man their whole thing is just to get drug dealers off so they can go back to doing  what it is they do get wealthy yeah who else is in the movie you're in um james khan um um mila  cruz zoe saldana and um clive owens who's mila cruz i like how you said clive owen last that was  good i'm thinking who's in this movie oh clive owen oh yeah i mean because you know all of them do 
[02:21:30]  what they think to me so yeah yeah yeah yeah oh and james khan i would love to do something with  james khan it's hilarious i did a pretty good movie with him called middlemen uh he's uh he's very  you ever had him on the show no we can't get him we don't get everybody we do pretty good these days  i swear to god i thought you said we don't get and then say like good guests or something no we're  getting better yeah i know there's jokes there but i mean we are doing better finally after so many  fucking years but still not uh the james khan no no you always have amazing people the 
[02:22:00]  fucking the cusack thing was incredible oh we loved cus holy crap he was all right yeah and we were all  warned that he was going to be a complete dick yeah sometimes you get a word everybody warned us  that oh good luck with that and then what happened he couldn't have been nice he was great he was  great you know who stunk was uh paris hilton and i was hoping she wouldn't i was like i really didn't  want her to be the one person that everybody said she was like this awful vapid idiot and she was like  the was yeah yeah she was probably the worst we've ever talked to she's stunk it's always the 
[02:22:30]  ones that don't really have a a real talent are the assholes in here i'm serious she was a reality  they're out of their league usually that's why you walk in here and you're out of your league  day listers that we get there they couldn't be nicer in general right no one's been a dick to us  lately that's how it is usually i mean especially people that just work on their craft and enjoy it  they love people paris hilton wants to just plug everything she was doing her dumb perfume and her dumb  clothing line and her dumb shoe line it's like who cares no one cares tell us some cool stories  but she wasn't even so we had some dirt on her not on her on some shit and we just brought it up 
[02:23:00]  it's like and she's looking at her publicist to save her and she was getting all pissed and she  fucking basically walked out of us how can you not know what to expect when you come in and she needed  us because she was trying to uh make another run at the reality show thing and she wanted to cross  demos a little bit and get a male demo she needed us it's like you're a reality person who won't give  anything real she didn't give me any information she was terrible our whole audience was turned  off by her and she needed those people i mean the show itself was kind of lame to begin with but i'm 
[02:23:30]  so happy she fell off the fucking map i couldn't be happier i don't know she was in the paper the  other day she made another hundred million or something did she really on her shit yeah it's  amazing who i consider a failure she's a fucking hilton and she's worth a hundred million dollars and i'm  like who knows probably way more than that jimmy she's not good on the radio so she sucks no but  she she created a new uh a new way into fame you know she created kim kardashian is exactly  she knocked her out of the game which is hilarious paris begett kardashian she brought uh kardashian 
[02:24:00]  out make your own porno tape and then kardashian took over and then they pushed paris hilton no but  how desperate is this country for royalty that that we hold up the kardashian like that i  fucking hate that blows my mind i'm obsessed with hating them too yeah i know it's a problem  i don't get it i don't i don't understand why i i don't understand yeah i'm no one can explain it  to me i'm angry at the audience yes yeah i'm not angry at them for trying and whoring themselves  you do whatever you want you know what but it's the audience that holds them up like royalty that 
[02:24:30]  makes me want to bomb we just like mindless stuff i guess i don't know what it is and you know  you know they know how to make it look beautiful also oh yeah you know because she's beautiful yeah  she's very sexy i mean but she is so stupid did she do a porn tape she did right did she that was  her that's entree to me i kind of respect that though like if you're going to be a celebrity i  love the fact that she sucked dick on tape like i really do appreciate that like how many actresses  would you love to see do that all she had to do is blow somebody and we're like all right give 
[02:25:00]  her a show but you want to see famous people do that who have already established themselves as  being talented this girl just straight up said i'm a whore here's the tape of it the paris hilton  tape was pretty fucking hot yeah i mean i've never seen paris hilton gave great fucking blow  jobs pretty fucking she was wonderful and i've never seen the uh kim kardashian tape but paris  hilton's was great oh that's paris right there yeah playful and silly  but she won't talk about it she doesn't like to talk about it it's like that's what that's not  even what we brought up anthony hinted to it but lightly what was the thing there was one thing we 
[02:25:30]  brought up that was in the news at the time yeah i don't remember but anthony hinted towards the  tape yeah and she wouldn't you do martial arts right i do do you watch do you watch ufc i love  ufc oh you do ufc is it's fierce though ufc is i mean you get hit in the chin with it i saw this one  guy get hit with a shin a right a roundhouse kicking a shin his whole body neck froze i really  feel bad for those guys because they look like they're gonna die yeah by the time they get out that 
[02:26:00]  ring or be severely brain damaged yeah there's one asian dude that cracked this dude's arm and  flipped it to the back look he literally bent his arm out of position and the guy didn't tap out  that's unbelievable yeah that's really not stop was this on tv or is this like in a gym no i was  watching this on you know sometimes i go on youtube when i miss them also so i was watching it online  it wasn't a ufc event no this he fights um around the world but he fights in china yeah yeah and he's  like the biggest star out there what's his name now we gotta see the video yeah and this dude 
[02:26:30]  actually tore his arm out of position and would not stop until that's the thing with ufc i mean  listen if i'm fighting you in martial arts and i see i got you i know it's go for the kill but  if i see i have you i'm not gonna there's certain things i'm just not gonna do i'm not gonna take  it the distance where i'll crack your neck until you tap out but how about if it's one of those guys  though like the thing with those guys is any one of them can turn it around like when you watch the  son and silver fight he was beating the shit out of him for the entire fight and then silver  tapped him with a minute and a half left in the fifth round or two minutes left in the fifth round 
[02:27:00]  it's almost like you have to keep going with these guys because they're fucking animals you don't want  to get in the ring with the gracie brothers or anybody that can hit the floor with you in five  seconds and demolish you how long have you been taking it i've been studying martial arts for over  10 years oh okay so you're a real guy yeah yeah i kind of slowed down with it but it's something  that's like riding a bike huh can they do the crane the cats dance the crane the horse  did he do the crane because we because what's his name we had ralph macchio yesterday he wouldn't  do the crane yeah i i still want to see the train the funny thing is he beat us he beat us to the 
[02:27:30]  punch he's like i'm telling you right off the bat i'm not doing the crane so don't ask who do you do  it for he's forced to do it with somebody i go time i go if someone's famous enough you're doing the  crane for them but i guess we're not for a funny or die video funny or die that's the only other time  he ever did for his own video train stance yeah like like you know at the end of the karate kid  it's called the crane that's right that's right and ralph macho has been asked to do it ever since  that movie came out would he do wax on wax off yeah we should ask it was called wax on fuck off 
[02:28:00]  that's the video i think yeah yeah on on funnier did you see the oh did you see the uh the wire  the musical i haven't seen it yet it's good it's funny yeah it is mike told me about it i was  working when they shot it oh you couldn't do it yeah yeah he sings and uh it was uh they had a real  fat guy play stringer bell which was really funny so yeah i guess uh the women are angry  yeah probably was he the guy that everybody wanted to fuck kind of on the show oh yeah yeah  stringer bell yeah the women lined around the corner for him they did right yeah 
[02:28:30]  yeah yeah they loved him and they still do yeah that's gotta be nice yeah  it's gotta be nice to play a role people want to fuck you for who are your uh ufc guys before we  move on from that you know tito yeah yeah we know tito yeah yeah you like tito  yeah yeah i do i do i don't know he's past his prime though yeah well no i i don't know if  i mean look once the ufc it was the ufc but once you get in the ring i guess with the young guys and  faster guys they can probably embarrass you you see john jones fight obviously no you know just 
[02:29:00]  the thing i have oh check out john jones is he nice he's yeah he might be the best he throws elbows  like punches imagine that what happened to my man um the guy he used to have the the the he was like  a street fighter also oh kimbo slice got beat up very badly in ufc he did terrible no i saw it when  it was somebody that actually pulled out on a fight last minute he took the fight right yeah yeah that  went in that was the fight that he lost yeah he got beat up the guy dropped that that was elite xc  that was supposed to be like he was like the face of that company and uh kind of like liddell was for 
[02:29:30]  ufc at one point pick that up cbs or something yeah they had millions invested in a huge failure  they really needed kimbo slice to beat up some people it didn't happen yeah it was just that  that went away it's always amazing how guys are not impressed with each other i'm so impressed with  certain things that people can do and when they're just not impressed with each other it's like that  fucking guy is really good at something i'm telling you man like it's to have somebody that can tear up  everybody in this room without even trying yeah it's kind of humiliating for a man jimmy takes 
[02:30:00]  punches and choke holes and all sorts of i do yeah i literally like 20 guys by now oh man  it's it's yeah how's what's in it for you just nothing that's a turn on in some weird way no  not a sexual turn on no how's the bruise on the arm it's actually not bad i got hit the other day  he's a bantamweight guy but he hits really hard to us it was 100 to him he's like ah 50 i hit him  oh wow but it looks like 100 you just wanted to see what it felt like yeah i do with all those guys  he gets choked out right i've heard i don't pass out though but wouldn't you do that like 
[02:30:30]  you go on you go out with a detective to see what it is they do well this is kind of like  the same thing because you're on your way to the ufc to fight that's a good point no not necessarily  i want to i want to do one but every time when it comes down to it i push out take the punch  the last second i'm like ah no an instinct an instinct maybe yeah i sort of want to join jim  jim jimmy with this thing and then i push out every time the worst that can happen the john jones  thing was the worst the shin kick to the upper thigh yeah i mean it's one of those things where 
[02:31:00]  you do something and you like the leg stuff hurt a lot you said what you almost puked on the spot i  almost vomited yeah because your body gets shocked you're in a shock very much so and it wasn't shock  like for a bullet wound but it hurt uh badly i thought i was gonna vomit and he probably hit you in a  very good pressure point what did he hit you at the hip right here no he hit me with in in the middle of  the uh the meat part of the thigh like he hit me in a pretty safe place i guess the charlie horse area  the charlie horse area on the outside of the thigh that's that's enough yeah if you notice when they 
[02:31:30]  fight they usually they'll spar with you and then they'll kick you in that area right there but they  kick you five times the fifth or sixth time you can't lift your leg up yeah it does uh what did  uriah say it's like getting hit with a baseball bat i know if you're getting a serious massage and they  go to that charlie horse area too and too intensely a real massage right it's not fun  it's not a good massage right yeah i love when they go i'm i'm gonna just uh separate these muscles  they're grouped together right now don't separate me it's horrendous what's worse than a massage 
[02:32:00]  where they're working actually working on the muscles i'm like what are you doing you really  think that's what i came for to get my thigh muscle hurt you think that's why i'm here i didn't  take a sialis an hour ago what the fuck are you doing sialis for a massage oh yeah you're my hero  absolutely it's funny because i'm i was getting a massage and and i i like to get you know beat up  yeah i don't like just don't touch me don't lay your hands on me and just softly no go in tie 
[02:32:30]  massages dig into the tissue and the masseuse said she said my god you you make me work i mean do you  have to get it so intense and i was like yeah i mean that's what i come to massage i'm a brooklyn  boy you know you like it deep yeah you know if we're gonna go to school whatever we're gonna  do let's go let's get our knuckles dirty but well yeah i kind of agree with getting your knuckles  dirty but for different reasons you've never had a she's massaging me uh yeah i hated it you did  hate yes it was too painful yeah but you feel the effects days later you feel kind of loose and good 
[02:33:00]  dude i like light rubs over the nipples i like when they brush and they rub the nipple i love that  what do you offer i know they just don't offer the nipple uh touch i fucking love that that feels  wonderful a deep tissue i don't know what are you doing i mean that's how would you do that yeah  well you know it it works especially on a six-hour flight to la and you get off that plane it's just  like good gosh do you ever get a happy ending one no he's just a nice guy no no i never got a happy i 
[02:33:30]  never even knew what a happy ending was i was in germany and it was time to go and you know everybody's  going to get a massage we're doing a play and um everybody said they were going to go get a  massage and one of the guys said yeah don't you know don't make a mistake get a happy ending so  i was like what's that what's happy ending he's like dear boy you're so naive i was like what and  he schooled me on to what it was that was my first time ever knowing what it was wow yeah it's crazy  yeah what a nice healthy guy like emotionally healthy yeah that is have you ever gotten how do you  deal with that deal with what i'm an emotionally healthy guy i don't mind i mean i have most of my 
[02:34:00]  friends are like that but i have is it weird to you it's like it's foreign to me right like like  i'm i'm talking to him as if he just came off the space shuttle uh-huh like that's how i feel like  i have no comprehension he's got something everybody's got something we're just we're  just not gonna get i'm not a politician no you see the thing about it the politician would be a job  to dig in right yeah but you know i'm not a part we all got something going on all i got is hot coffee  and water is that what they're calling it now hot coffee and water did we ask you last time you 
[02:34:30]  got that you got the scar how did you get that oh man it's one of those stories that um i try to  keep it in my backpack oh okay you know is it a sad story so i don't consider it a sad story only  because i'm here okay you know and it's something to feed on you know i love to feed on it for work  and how without the story how do you feed on it without the story yeah like how do you how do you feed on  it like how what does it do for you does it make you when you're working does it make you  angry or does it take you someplace you know today it might make you angry tomorrow it might make 
[02:35:00]  you sad and it might you know lucky to be alive lucky to be it's one yeah it's one of those you  know too many people don't agree with it but i study the method i enjoy it i enjoy sense memory i enjoy  emotional preparation i enjoy substitution for dramatic events i enjoy like just relaxing and going and digging  deep and just trying to bring something up working from the inside out so those things work for me  how do you do that like when you whatever the experience is how do you go back because i think 
[02:35:30]  uh brando would do that a lot of those great actors how do you take a past experience and like i would  all i would be thinking about like say i want to talk about you know i had to be humiliated so i was  just thinking about the first of many times i've lost an erection with a woman that's an easy one to  recall but how do you make your real life moment acting from that how do you do that without  losing the moment you're in well you work on it beforehand you don't work on it while you're there  i mean well that's my mistake yeah if you don't work on it beforehand don't even try to do it while 
[02:36:00]  you're there just say the lines you know if that's if that's all you have but for me it's the preparation  before and get into that mindset and get to that emotional place and then after that you know you get  on set and then you go and if it's in your way you just keep it moving i mean don't let it block  you because a lot of times it can block you and i think that's where a lot of techniques get a bad  name also because people try to do it on the spot instead of really focusing on a person and having a  simple conversation when you were growing up was it was it a good situation or a tough situation 
[02:36:30]  it was a lot of love it was balanced but you know even if it was tough i didn't recognize it until  i was aware that oh shoot hold on a second they got a liquor store and a chinese restaurant next to each  other this is not good you know but at the same time for me it was all love you know right i mean  fire hydrants in the summertime kick the can you know touch football but drama also which is what  part of new york brooklyn oh you grew up yeah i grew up in brooklyn so when you would see that stuff  like whatever it was that was violent around you how did you avoid that because like you get a guy 
[02:37:00]  like tyson mike tyson grew up in a violent situation and used it for his yeah he also shipped out too  yeah he did he got out and dipped back in did you guys see the documentary it was unbelievable  oh my goodness when he said he would jump on the train and come back into new york and then do his  dirt and then sneak back because it was customized yeah told him listen don't get caught up in any um  dirt because if you do i'm gonna drop you it was amazing they would come back and like beat up people  and rob people he was he was a rough dude yeah tyson he was in brownsville brownsville is 
[02:37:30]  are you familiar with brownsville yeah i'm familiar with the name of the name right yeah i would love to  just say that i used to go there but i'd go over there one day and just furthest from brownsville  why that'd be that's not that's not a good suggestion go there and just walk i don't get a  lot of love though can white guys walk around yeah you guys are probably more safe why because  oh they would think we're uh cops or no no one would think i'm a cop i look too soft it's in my eyes  i'm a fucking puss it's just you know you know it's just nobody would bother it's like me walking in 
[02:38:00]  well and again walking it's like me walking in a neighborhood where i'm probably the standout guy  i'm probably more safe because nobody would really want to address me like that right you guys would  walk into brownsville or something it would be all love i mean guys don't really attack like that yeah  but they i just reek of victim let's walk around let's walk around brownsville get the video camera  and do it kevin you want to go let's go now let's let's get our but this method stuff is reminding me i 
[02:38:30]  worked with this actress on a movie who played my wife in the film and she was a method actress and  in the movie we're supposed to be married and then i cheat on her in the story of the film right so  when we were shooting in uh south beach florida so it's a location shoot which means the cast is  staying in hotels and they're going out to lunches and dinners together and every time we would go  out as a cast socially i'm class clown that's what i do right so i'm making everybody laugh and she's  just staring daggers at me the whole fucking time and even when i would say something but she i'd 
[02:39:00]  literally hear her a couple times go like that kind of thing like dismissive and i thought why  does this bitch hate me so much and i realized oh she's a fucking method actress and she has to hate  me while we're out socially because in the movie she fucking hates me wow that is so weird yeah and  i was like let it go baby you gotta have fun away from the set the thing about it some people can't  turn it on like for instance she's working like that because if she gets on set you know it's  sometimes the worst thing is to feel like you're phoning it in even when you're not trying to  and you feel insecure about it in a way you know it's like lee if i would have worked on this a 
[02:39:30]  couple of hours maybe right now my feet would have been grounded some people can turn it on like that  and some people need that preparation and i know she was staring daggers at you because yeah she didn't  want to think of me as the funny guy exactly while we were working in the scene how do you act with  someone that you don't have the chemistry or you hate and it's not part of the role that's when and have  you had those that's when you catch yourself acting um but do you look at the person like  i don't want i want to be in the same room absolutely but you pull it off you have to 
[02:40:00]  yeah yeah then you then you just go and you focus on the work and the and the words and the script and  that's why i have to familiarize myself with just the story within those pages that those scenes those  moments that's all that matters to me not the outside world not how i got to this place so yeah  sometimes you do have to you know it's that smiley face thing you know if you're sometimes  you just got to put on the fucking smiley face in between takes i know it's brutal but it's that's  the work sometimes that's the work i can't fake smile i know people can do it all the time i i hate 
[02:40:30]  that i can't do that because people can read my face and know what my mood is so you should come  i hate it you should come to my weekly poker game yeah but you know the for you know the fortunate  thing about that is you would probably be able to do it on set only because we shoot one scene like 10  times yeah right and one and then it's just like okay hold on a second i can't stand this person  but that check is heavy you know start thinking about the mind you know it's like okay and then  you know but and then you look at the person and it's just like okay hold on shoot take what same 
[02:41:00]  thing again over and over and over again eventually it just becomes mechanical whatever well it's gotta  be easy if it's somebody like if you're playing something that's confrontational if it's somebody  you don't like and you're playing something confrontational let's oh no then it works but i'm saying  when the characters are supposed to get along in the project the movie whatever and you know there's no chemistry or the  you absolutely don't dislike the person that's that's what i was getting at yeah my bottom line  is always use it to your advantage i'm there to have fun if the process itself isn't fun you know if  you enjoy your job you'll never work a day in your life that's sort of always my how many movies you 
[02:41:30]  do i don't know the exact number 68 by the way six six of them six of them really good yeah my batting average  fucking stinks but six of them are pretty solid yeah have you done a movie where you know it's bad  while you're doing it because i did one uh-huh um tell them it was i was i was terrible and the script  was really bad um it was called white chicks incorporated just buy it just to see how awful 
[02:42:00]  i am and florentine is the lead i play a i think they wanted me to play a comedian named jerry steinfeld  sure like uh as i take on i'm like just let me use my name and they let me use my name but i  sucked in this movie was it the movie or was it everything it couldn't have been worse so why'd  you take that why wouldn't i no one was offering me anything i had not this years ago jim just goes  you want to be in a movie that's how you know it's a bad movie when your friend calls you and he goes  you're right around saturday you can be in the movie and um i went to the premiere and it was 
[02:42:30]  embarrassing to watch myself fucking boss is it remember i showed you the clips of our friend rich  boss you know and uh all his fucking his uh poorly edited fucking uh close-ups yeah really bad it's a  strange profession where we're not really allowed by the public to do something for the money it's  the one of the few professions like you know for civilians or non-actors uh when they talk to each  other about their jobs it is about making more money it is about that so much of the time and if an 
[02:43:00]  actor ever works just for the paycheck he's a piece of shit so real so you absolutely do that  you'll take a project knowing oh boy if you have a mortgage and an alimony payment you know on a  regular basis you got to work right michael madsen i'm a worker michael madsen was one of the first  ones that we learned that he's like oh i did that movie because i owed my ex uh i did it for a mortgage  he said there are named things that uh he went down to do certain awful films he went down his list of  movies and told us which ones he did because he had i owed a guy money in vegas just unbelievable 
[02:43:30]  but why like you know why is that so shameful and obviously if you have a choice of scripts stacked  up you're going to pick the best ones and you look at big stars with big names who eventually start  doing lesser films and you think what happened there and if you're on the inside you know what happened  there the offers became uh less of the quality stuff and more of the not as quality stuff like  and you want to work because that's your job you want to work yeah that's exactly what you want to 
[02:44:00]  do yeah you want to constantly be on set hoping that someone says this guy's great for this other  thing for this other thing and the project that you're doing isn't great well here's the other  question then have you ever gone into a movie going oh this is gonna be the biggest piece of  shit ever and it turned out to be amazing no what happens is you you think i hope somebody sees this  i doubt that that's going to reach much of an audience that happened on usual suspects that movie  was made for five million dollars shot in less than six weeks starring nobody gabriel burn was the 
[02:44:30]  biggest name at the time in the film right right kevin spacey was a character actor like myself trying  to get work he hadn't starred in the movie and so you just think god the script is so great i hope  somebody sees this somehow and i've done a lot of movies like that not a lot but me easily a dozen  where no one did ultimately see that and you know it was good you just know the script is a  motherfucker but nobody ever saw it nobody ever saw them and then you walk down the street and  they're like man when i'm gonna see you in some work yeah i got a new 12 projects  how about you search some some of this shit out yeah check me out yeah ndb now never been easier to 
[02:45:00]  get a small film finance never been more difficult to get a proper distribution because all the  fucking money goes to marketing and if they don't have the money for marketing so you're never  surprised no one's gonna hear about this film but you were never surprised that something that a piece  of shit turned out great yeah well i can honestly say i've never read a script and said this is an  absolute piece of shit when do i start gotcha yeah that has never happened i'll take films that  oh god i wish this was better but not a flat-out piece of shit got it yeah burt reynolds we've  been talking lately about boogie nights and he didn't know how good boogie nights he didn't want 
[02:45:30]  to fire his agent oh did he fire his fire his agent i can't fucking believe you got me in this  thing this is horrible absolutely did not know didn't understand it didn't understand the tone  do you think he ever apologized to his agent of course not he was nominated for an oscar for that  mark walberg was here and he said that when reynolds first did it he was doing it like in a weird irish  accent because he missed he he had trouble with uh was it paul thomas or whoever wrote it um and he  was in walberg was laughing while he was while reynolds was was reading because he thought he was joking 
[02:46:00]  around but he wasn't he just took a terrible take on it and then i think he said no no you can't do it in  an irish accent yeah we should take a break okay you're sticking around jamie all right good and  we got a plug to uh it's this saturday how do people how do people sign up to go and play paintball  with the wire because we've turned a lot of people on to the wire um i've said i think it's the best tv  series ever and i really mean that and uh you can go and meet uh some of the greatest members of the  cast right which is of course you're playing do we know um michael kastroff isaiah isaiah with 
[02:46:30]  who was levy hold on levy and and uh isaiah whitlock was clay uh was uh clay davis and uh  sonya son was uh i've never met her fuck no yeah if i wish i would have known she's coming down today  so she can do this with us on saturday um i would have told her to come up and who else michael k  williams michael k williams jd which is he played bodie as well as um the dominic lombandozzi who's uh  who is uh who we love of course he's been in here yeah he really is and he's doing well with breakout kings 
[02:47:00]  most of the guys he's also on blood ties also oh he's on the movie yeah yeah yeah uh the website's  moving mountains nyc.org moving mountains nyc.org or moving mountains inc at gmail.com all right  and you could like help it's like for city kids who to get into acting and stuff and kind of go on a  nice you set up a theater or something right i did i did you know i remember yeah how's that going  it's going great good for you amazing and the mark warburg foundation the um the brooklyn museum  medgar evers everybody basically came together and they they're helping it grow and develop you 
[02:47:30]  know it was basically taking underprivileged kids in the city community in the city communities and  we just giving them an outlet to come and create he's just a good guy he's a nice guy james just  no you know what happened for me he's just a good guy paying it forward paying it forward yeah but  other people go ah i thought that yeah but you know it's crazy though because when you do it you  realize that it does something to you that nothing else can possibly do if you're passionate about it i mean  run out to see them grow i'll tell you man my sex addiction really has stopped me from doing a lot 
[02:48:00]  of things in the last few years you think honestly yeah it's like there's all this outside stuff  like being sober part of being sober is they say to keep it you got to give it away part of  you know it's kind of passing along a good thing to other people and it's like yeah well you hear guys  do i've never heard anyone come in and go yeah i'm working with this charity and it really eats ass i  hate it it always helps you grow as a person and it's good for you i should do more of that stuff  we'll start a charity well i don't see inner city kids taking my acting directing  uh very well i mean you they respect as an actor well you know instead of starting a charity just 
[02:48:30]  you know come to moving mountains be a part of moving mountains yeah i brought a check yeah did you  yeah i didn't want to write a check i wrote a bundle look y'all jimmy wrote a check well yeah yeah  i brought a lot of love yeah this time that means i gotta write a check now you don't have to i compete  with you let's let's write checks all right kevin you're writing a check i'll teach the kids to do  christopher wolf let's go listen and they would love it talking walking with i n talking with i  n walking i n on itunes kevin pollack's uh chat show uh we'll continue in just a bit stay there 
[02:49:00]  wow that was deep yeah went too fucking deep there see the similarities with the camera  uh no kidding see it's too bad we took a break i don't even know if we could relive that i just  learned that jamie hector is uh a father almost uh and almost three-year-old that's right because 
[02:49:30]  i got a two-year-old and then ah we're talking about relationships and shit and staying in  relationships way too long knowing that the relationship was shit and we got to the bottom  of the acting issue who's all these who are these who are you they're probably guys from liberty media  let's liberty media new bosses who are you thumbs up i know that was the bit 
[02:50:00]  they were frightened best buy oh get out of here that company's going down  who goes to best buy anymore i was there recently actually did you really yes i did jimmy i made a  purchase of uh something for my computer oh i bought a new printer did you yeah worst story  ever but i really did i was i can't tell you how happy i can print from my iphone you like that  anyone got printing questions since i can't act i might as well talk printing yeah that's what i'm 
[02:50:30]  good it's hilarious i was at best buy at 2 30 in the morning the best thing they could have done  is open at 24 hour best buy on 14th street union square and i was there two o'clock this morning these  guys are getting what they want outside the studio we're doing a fucking three minute commercial  yeah jamie hector is promoting why why uh were you there 2 30 this morning because you know um  on thursday i have a showcase with the kids at the brooklyn museum and i directed a short film  and i wanted to load that short film onto some dvd dash negative r whatever right so i went all over 
[02:51:00]  looking for it and i went to best buy when did you get sleep i didn't last night yeah i didn't sleep  you've been up since yesterday yeah i mean i think you know how do you do that just thinking  about tonight i'm the worst to go to sleep tonight oh really just thinking about sleep tonight yeah i  got a question for jamie hector and uh everyone knows you from the wire obviously yes and it is it  frustrating that they don't know you from other stuff in general and and part two the question what  is the second most uh thing you're known for it's not frustrating that and no one knows me from 
[02:51:30]  anything else i shouldn't say like that people do but i love the wire i love it but don't mention the  wire every single time every single time i only know you from season three when you when you had  the cameo as the cop that's what i'm kidding he had a cameo in the wire before he became marlo  that's why i'm saying why no no no no that wasn't me that was bingo oh i thought that was you  you were never in before i was never in before oh but bingo was and then they said all right let's  make me that didn't happen we're gonna build a whole new character okay oh yeah i didn't know that 
[02:52:00]  because it was funny but you know like doing magnificent films such as the usual suspects  all right and just being a part of that you know it's fun to be a part of it because not too many  films or television shows actually stand the test of time all right and it carries its weight so when  you get an opportunity to be a part of something like that look call me marlo what was the second  most popular uh role you had the second most pop well i think that would be different based on  the one that i enjoyed or the one that people enjoyed both i guess i well you know i think people 
[02:52:30]  really enjoyed heroes um big time huge yeah people really enjoyed that i mean most devoted  fan base ever most devoted fan base they weren't big enough to keep the show on the air forever  but the ones who saw it were devoted to the point of ridiculous comic-con was ridiculous i mean all of  those it's just it's just the fan base for those shows they're more passionate they're so passionate  i mean when somebody comes and they dress like you yeah or they send you a box of cards and just say just 
[02:53:00]  put your name on it please and we'll just send you some just or come to london and do it it's just  like hold on a second this is like a fan base that's out of this world they're not doing that for two  and a half men and that's not happening there's no two and a half men booth at the comic-con and it  was fun right heroes the fact that you know you always want to be a superhero when you're a kid  and that's the closest that i get to becoming a superhero where i can smell your fear and get very  strong damn and you see the work happening that was fun i enjoyed that let me uh hit the phone 
[02:53:30]  here anthony's back on and hi how are you hi anthony how are you duty hi everybody oh i i'm sorry  i don't think i'll be serving on the uh any jury how'd you get out you find chris's mom well put it  this way uh i'm much too jaded and uh cynical to uh really make a fair judgment of anybody at this point  in my life is racist the word we're looking for well that's another word i guess you could say 
[02:54:00]  uh racist uh did you just play it up uh to get out of jury duty no i just i couldn't play it up i just  said i uh you know i can't make a fair decision about anything uh because of uh my line of work  puts me uh where where i see a lot of uh horrible stories and uh they and i can't make i can't judge  anybody i'm terribly were you able to say that to a judge though no i just had to say it 
[02:54:30]  what'd you say it to i i mumbled it to myself in the room  anthony this is jamie you know if you actually if they see you nodding off hey what's going on anthony  if they see you nodding off they can actually tell you to get off the jury they say look we don't need  you nice that's that's a good tip i was nodding off in the big room screening process there were  like uh 200 people in a room and uh they started um calling names and stuff they called my name i went 
[02:55:00]  into a small room and spoke to somebody and uh and uh i'm in my car now that was it i'm done yeah you're  better off getting selected to go in front of the judge and they interview you until and and yeah you  can get red flagged real quick yeah yeah it was uh it was the guy that uh that vouched my weapon  i was a big fan of the show i like that too that's right nice very good so everything that worked out  i won't have to do jury duty i could uh concentrate on entertaining the people on the opian anthony show 
[02:55:30]  something i've never done before well it would be nice a fresh start well kevin kevin pollack's here  and he's convinced you don't like him because every time he comes around you're not here  i heard that when i was driving here uh i heard that kevin pollack is in there uh he doesn't think  i'm a fan i am a huge fan of your work sir and uh i feel uh like i'm missing something i i never get  to be in the studio when you're in well now say something nice to jamie hector jamie hector knows  i love him he's fucking great all right that was sincere right you just don't want to have beers 
[02:56:00]  with him huh you just like his work yeah why don't you invite jamie over to your house yeah  why don't you have jamie over oh yeah break some bread eh yeah i would totally be into that what  are you kidding but it wouldn't be fun for jamie or kevin to come over just see me and anthony sitting  in the hot tub with a couple of fucking that's what we do what's that a couple lobsters yeah we just  kind of sit in the hot tub and talk at our fuck it's really creepy and homoerotic it sucks 
[02:56:30]  how about some girls yeah do you know girls you can bring you the one you guys sure sure i do okay  that's a no you know casely well it what it is a nice day and it's uh it's uh only a quarter to uh  ten and uh i i think i'm headed to the pool oh that's nice have fun this worked out beautifully  and you didn't have to see kevin again i hope i yeah i hope i get a chance to see you next time  man i'm not develop this uh really he's kissing nasa's security he's got his nasa hat on he's 
[02:57:00]  kissing nasa's ass today uh well well he should we uh you know hey maybe you could finance a spaceship  for us since uh you know all budget cuts we don't even have a goddamn spacecraft for our astronauts  to get to the station terrible yeah i couldn't agree more just a little political message there  it's pretty sad that we let that go exactly you can't do that in america godspeed on the way to  the pool yeah yeah i'm getting the hell out of here and uh uh have a great uh rest of the day 
[02:57:30]  i'll see everyone what do you mean rest of the day i think we we celebrate that you're uh out of jury  duty and we get the hell out of here well you should do that i think so see you at the pool all  right all right i'm there see you tomorrow later all right we covered a lot of ground do you change  diapers yeah you know before what's wrong with that though i just it's never bothered me no no i  thought it would too i'll be honest i've seen the shitty diapers i'm like fuck no when it's yours 
[02:58:00]  you get right in there the delicate part i would never young before until before i had my child  i would never hold a young baby nope i didn't either yeah too small too delicate i would wait  until they were about six months old and then i would start holding them so then when i would start  cleaning my daughter wiping her and i just wouldn't go all you know there's certain things i wouldn't do  and it's like give me that oh you're not doing it properly let me do it right and i was like oh god  oh your wife would do the unpleasant parts she would do the unpleasant parts because i would do it 
[02:58:30]  halfway because you know you have heavy hands and i don't want to really like touch the baby and  like squeeze the baby in any way or i gotta let me feel uncomfortable right i gotta lift up my kid's  ball bag all sorts of shit louis ck talked about that especially daughters daughters have vaginas and  he goes it's weird but he goes when you're cleaning a baby how do you how do you clean that properly you  you just how do you do that that was my i know how to clean up clean the dick i don't know how to  do a vagina because we're so we're such a sexual perverted society that we're taught like even like 
[02:59:00]  a legitimate touching like as a parent cleaning a kid that's 100 legit it is but we're kind of now  been like ingrained to believe that it's wrong or it's fucking that's all strange yeah somebody else  was talking about that too with their with with i think noam from the comedy saw he has a daughter  and he's just cooking no i let my wife clean i think that i think i would let my wife do that  if we had a daughter would you really i think so at least in the beginning i think that would be a  little weird well in the beginning but then eventually she would turn around and say you 
[02:59:30]  need to clean that yeah exactly you need to learn how to do that because i don't want to do it right  now yeah at first though i would do it i don't know be very cautious it's just weird to me yeah it  gets you afraid of hurting the baby or something i don't know yeah i don't know i don't know hurting  the baby it's just forming this is something that cleaning the baby in the beginning stages  but eventually you know but at first it's just like you had the diapers all the way up the back  to the neck oh lord you can't just hold them down you can't just stick them in the bathtub or something 
[03:00:00]  that's what i thought with that spray nozzles sometimes they shit all the way up to their neck  in their back well halfway up their back easily sometimes way up there well i hope you tell them  that's not acceptable yeah yeah so it's a bummer look them in the eyes and say no yeah that's bad  bad that won't affect them at all in their later life and toilet train them angrily  i'm not supposed to shake his daddy do you have children or no i've seen children  i'm sure it all works out on paper no i'm not a breeder never wanted to be 
[03:00:30]  i just knew from an early age that it was not for me uh how do you know though i don't know how i  don't know what click well first was probably just narcissism uh and then it was mostly narcissism  and then and i have nieces and nephews and i love them crazy and spoil them rotten love to spend time  with them but uh leave you like the i couldn't give over my life to it now granted it what you guys say  and i've always known was 100 true if it were my own in a heartbeat my mind would change but since i 
[03:01:00]  have control over the situation i'm going to avoid it that's right tell people your your mind would  change in a heartbeat and i know that i do i've always known that i'm not stupid you know it's  a human nature condition thing that would that just completely takes over but if i'm i believe  in planned parenthood you know if you don't want them don't fuck around with it the great part about  it with with with you is if you decide tomorrow yeah that you want a child you can go and have one  right yeah right you know you mean as a man or as a guy who's rich 
[03:01:30]  don't get me wrong i've bought several children  no but i mean like you can afford it if you get a girl pregnant it's not going to  fucking ruin you financially which is where are you at kevin you got a girl uh yeah i've been with  the same one so what if she wanted to have a kid now i made sure when i chose her that she did not  want children okay yeah do you do what i do just pick transsexuals it's just so much easier  none of your friends know i am i have become fascinated by this fascination of yours uh 
[03:02:00]  because it's so honest that there's it's undeniable in terms of being fascinated to someone who who uh  doesn't know anything about it um but i've no i've i've picked a uh straight-up heterosexual  young woman yeah they're fun yeah yeah i love a good heterosexual five years to get living together  now i'm thrilled to death i'm always feeding off her like a vampire when you meet a woman  though how long have you been with your wife for a while right it's like when you meet a woman 
[03:02:30]  how do you commit forever like opie's mad i don't know how you do it like i'm so afraid of seeing  the end of like i'm afraid of getting older so seeing the end of the tunnel i think you gotta  as soon as you can move in with them and find out what you're really really dealing really  absolutely i mean when you when you feel strongly enough about it you have to live under the same  roof to find out exactly what the fuck you're in for i think it was easier because uh i'm older too  and no question yeah i i had my i had a good fucking time and this is this is what i want now 
[03:03:00]  you're not old enough this is absolutely what i want now i have no doubt yeah i can't imagine  being in your early 20s especially as a guy committing like that so the i don't know what  the fuck i was doing in my early 20s thank god you don't have to yeah yeah how did you make a place  you know well i know it's such a long time oh you know you're friends yeah yeah were you friends  first 12 yeah we were friends okay you've known her since 12 you were 12 that's fantastic how old  were you 16 oh okay so you started 40 yeah i started dating maybe when she was 13 14 but we were just  you know we were kids yeah kids ever since then um and we just grew to know each other and like each 
[03:03:30]  other that is such a rarity wait you've only been one girl then no sir no no wait wait wait i have it  but you know we've known each other we've been together when were you guys an item serious  serious five years before i got married i was married in 2009 five maybe two yeah four or five  years before we got married became a serious item but even before that okay girlfriend boyfriend  breakup i got business i go to california then i come back and then it's like hey you know gotcha 
[03:04:00]  you like being married yeah i enjoy it it's fun you know it changes your mindset yeah because now all  of a sudden you are home at a certain time and we're also without realizing yeah protectors by  nature uh it's boy that dna comes out fast i don't know it does and i can't imagine what you guys go  through with children i would kill yeah absolutely i think brewer said it best he told me you realize  you are capable of killing a human being when you have a kid yeah and when he said that it spoke to 
[03:04:30]  me i'm like fuck man you're absolutely right yeah you would absolutely would kill somebody right  right i have no doubt you also know that feeling when you're a stand-up comic you also learn that  instinct really quick how easy it would be to behead somebody in front of an applauding audience has  there been a transsexual you would kill for oh has there been one i wouldn't  perfection perfection yeah they are a wonderful group you know it's hilarious moving in with a young 
[03:05:00]  lady before i got i don't even think i could do it because i think if i if i did that i would have  never gotten married right only for me personally only because you really learn the truth about  people once you move in with them and if i would move in with a female before i got married to them  then i'd be like because the one of the beefs that we had was that she would throw you know it's time  to put the garbage out right tuesday they pick up the garbage okay so if i put the garbage bag in there  on monday right and she throws and one piece of garbage in there take the garbage out i'm like 
[03:05:30]  what are you crazy right and that was beef well it's those things those little things because wait  you felt she was wasting the bag and it would be out tomorrow or was it the fact that she was nagging  you it's the fact that we were wasting the bag and i was being nagged i said look okay the garbage bag  is not full let's fill it up and then throw it out is that a guy thing because that bothers me too  me yeah it really does that was enough for me to actually to the tippy top like it has to be 
[03:06:00]  overflowing and then i'm like all right i'm ready to take this i just realized why i'm so happy at  home because my better half agrees with this too with the same theory what fill up the bag you fill  it up yeah but it is those little nitpicky things that you find out if you're made for each other but  i throw the bag out early i agree with your wife because i'm afraid of bugs and i'm afraid of roaches  and and and and a smell so if there's something like there's real something  fucking foodie in there i mean i have i'm in a big building it go i'll walk i'll just take take 
[03:06:30]  my fucking smart ones things and walk them right to the garbage and throw them out the  crazy smelly shit's got to go out sure yeah but if you throw in one little item like an apple core  or something and because it's garbage day right everything's got to go out that's bullshit so okay  so now you're not wanting to waste the bag are you are you overly cautious with money because  some people get very very cautious like if they grew up without a lot of money and then they  they get very very worried about it this yeah it's something that my i think it's my father actually  even though we i wasn't raised with my father but he had this thing with money where um i mean i like 
[03:07:00]  to save i like to invest i like to know that i have right you know so it's not even the overly  cautious thing was money it's to me it's just a logic yeah it's more logic than money with me  yeah it's like what you're going through even though i understand what you're saying in regards  to the garbage not throwing it out early but with her as a female i'm just like look  you really gonna throw trash out like that i wonder though if you said to her  here's why this bothers me like you just said casually to us have you had that conversation 
[03:07:30]  no we have had that conversation but no because that's something everyone can relate to and now we  throw the garbage out to the top right so you won i won because you related to her as a human  instead of a struggling fight fighting couple exactly well that's pretty great or do you not  think that if we were not married i would have printed probably for the garbage situation i'd  probably been like like i'm out yeah i can't deal with this this is nonsense but when you're  married look let's be honest you have a kid it's going to be a 50 50 split in court you can't 
[03:08:00]  you can't say 50 50 split in court or maybe a 60 40 or 90 10 so you can't take the 50 50 i'm  giving up my money for the rest of my career over garbage you have to find a compromise it becomes  it becomes a necessity yeah i guess that's why i haven't uh committed to a woman which i don't  want to compromise stuff like that yeah are you ocd oh she is hope i know you're gonna uh wrap  things up in a heartbeat but i promised i would give a quick shout out to one of your uber fans who's 
[03:08:30]  one of the producers on my chat show his name is jason mcintyre can he do anything for us and uh  yeah once you move to podcast he's a brilliant research producer that'll crush for you all right  yeah you know he's devoted to your show and turn me on you weren't supposed to tell people i'm  moving to podcasting though you've only said it a million times the only reason i mentioned it  yeah you haven't exactly kept it under your hat something about working once a week versus  every day oh man that sounds great yeah so she's ocd not you now yeah she's one of those that  washes hands every five minutes oh i'm surprised she wants the garbage to pile up then no she doesn't 
[03:09:00]  she doesn't oh i'm sorry that's oh that's okay that that makes perfect sense then okay  can she handle the is she handling this washing of the hands every five minutes i mean it's not as  severe but it's just more than i would expect i mean i wash my hands when it needs to get washed  you walk into the house you wash your hands but is that all she got in terms well that the garbage  situation to me that's ocd yeah you know supposedly we all have it yeah my mom has it really bad so i  know this world's a little bit god damn it we got some similar shit going on oh yeah oh yeah 
[03:09:30]  i think we got similar shit going on i don't wash my hands though the thing that we have going on  is that we're men right yeah it's like we kind of understand you know it it's those situations right  there does she clean the house too much yeah she cleans the house she's good with it she's cleaning  it right now she's yeah she's probably cleaning is she purell too much purell that's bad for too much  that actually makes you tell that makes your hands get more infected because you kill the natural  things howie mandel who's fucking completely ocd said that he had to stop using purell because you start 
[03:10:00]  growing little warts on your fingers oh wow because uh really yeah you you take away your  body's natural defense or whatever you overuse it it makes you get germier faster but it might be a  little better for the uh masturbation though with the rib the rib creating little rib tipped on your  fingers no you know what would feel good on your penis is what kevin's getting at no no i understand  that would imply that i use lubricant but i'm an angry masturbator what i do is i i just  fucking grab it and there's no budging like i straight jacket my dick and up down up down up
