<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous recap of Anthony Cumia's Memorial Day weekend party.  The hosts detailed the various levels of intoxication among the guests, highlighting Janine's multiple mishaps (falling into the jacuzzi fully clothed and breaking a glass).  Jimmy Norton was notably more sober than the others.  An uncomfortable encounter with a sober guest who discussed compulsive sexual behavior was also recounted. The conversation then transitioned to a discussion of the Indy 500, focusing on a lead driver's last-lap crash.  Speculation centered on the cause – driver error or a fuel miscalculation by the pit crew. Listener calls offered various opinions on the crash and racing strategy, leading into a discussion of Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s similar last-lap fuel-related loss in a NASCAR race.  A brief mention of a stick horse competition at a county fair segued into a discussion of an outbreak of horse herpes.  A heated, profanity-laced argument erupted with a caller who criticized the hosts' auto racing knowledge.

The show continued with further analysis of Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s race loss, focusing on the potential inexperience of his pit crew.  This sparked another angry confrontation with a caller, Chris from West Virginia, who aggressively insulted the hosts' commentary, prompting a heated exchange filled with vulgar insults. The conversation then veered into other topics: the number of female Indy 500 drivers, Kevin Harvick's racing strategy, and a recap of a previous show's clash with a guest, Bobo, who was removed from the show – drawing comparisons to a prior incident involving a guest's wig.  The hosts debated their approaches to handling such confrontations.

The show then delved into a series of news items: Snooki's arrest after crashing into a police car in Italy; the recurring topic of horse herpes; an Egyptian businessman accused of sexual assault; and the Casey Anthony trial. Opie detailed his provocative Twitter interactions with followers of the Casey Anthony hashtag, expressing his belief that she had a chance of acquittal.  This was followed by an unexpected discussion of the hosts' consumption of a large quantity of blueberries supplied by Kenny, before returning to a detailed analysis of the Casey Anthony defense strategy.  The segment concluded with a discussion of "Urban Bike Week" (Black Bike Week) in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, focusing on the high crime rates associated with the event.  The hosts discussed the political and economic complexities of addressing the event, which broadened into a discussion of crime rates in predominantly Black cities, including statistics from various cities, the decline of cities like Flint, Michigan, and the song about the Erie Canal. The discussion frequently employed vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments, particularly regarding a woman observed outside the studio window.

The following segment heavily focused on race and crime, particularly relating to Black Bike Week and Flint, Michigan. The hosts and callers frequently used racial slurs and stereotypes while discussing crime, poverty, and cultural differences within the Black community.  They analyzed videos of what they described as flash mobs engaging in theft and vandalism. The decline of the American auto industry, attributed to union demands, was also discussed.  Extended commentary covered differences between white and Black cultural experiences, including driving styles, fashion, and sexual behavior.  The hosts debated the causes of racial disparities, touching upon poverty, institutional racism, and individual responsibility. Several callers shared their experiences, including negative encounters with Black Bike Week and the dire policing situation in Flint. An AFL-CIO lawsuit against businesses closing during Black Bike Week was also mentioned.  A lengthy discussion regarding a video featuring a woman performing a "booty clap" dance was interspersed with further racial commentary and societal issues.  Jim Norton's controversial actions (mentioned in a newspaper article), and a planned segment featuring a retired NYPD officer and a firefighter were briefly mentioned. The segment concluded by referencing a previous show segment featuring a racist guest and the subsequent invitation of Black guests to offer counterpoints.

A call from Rodney in North Carolina challenged the hosts' use of crime statistics regarding the Black community, arguing that focusing on percentages without considering overall population size was misleading. The discussion explored systemic issues affecting the Black community, including lack of opportunity and family structure, acknowledging that not all individuals are equally affected. Opie and Anthony debated with Rodney, with Anthony sharing personal anecdotes. The conversation shifted to a New York Post article about Jim Norton's apartment and its role in his dating life.  A news story about an 85-year-old woman who was sexually assaulted and robbed led to a discussion about the death penalty.  A caller named Al supported the hosts' perspective, emphasizing environment and upbringing.  Al described Anthony as a realist, not a racist, but noted his outspokenness lacked subtlety.  The hosts discussed TV shows ("Breaking Bad," "My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding"), their preferences for different types of women, and the importance of acknowledging the past while focusing on present-day issues, concluding with plans to visit a Harlem restaurant for a "Black experience."

The final segment began with a graphic, violent, and sexually explicit description of a fictional assault, followed by increasingly absurd and vulgar details.  Ray Kurzweil's name was briefly mentioned, followed by a nonsensical interlude with a sound effect described as a "charm bracelet" and more sexually explicit language. The hosts then discussed their personal lives and upcoming appearances. Jimmy mentioned upcoming shows, including one in Chicago and an appearance on Sean Hannity's show. Anthony recounted receiving a call from Hannity and initially hanging up, leading to a humorous exchange about the potential appearance. The show concluded with standard closing remarks and show details.  No guests were present during this segment.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I like where this is going. I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  I'm telling you what we're going to hear in here today. Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out. 
[00:04:00]  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  Yay.  Good morning.  Hi. Good morning, everybody. What is it? Tuesday.  The day after our nice Memorial Day extended weekend.  You know, every once in a while we get a nice long three-day weekend.  Yeah.  But the Memorial Day long three-day weekend is a rough one to come back from.  No matter what you do.  Because for the most part, it's an active weekend.  Oh, big time.  You're doing things. There are parties to be had, places to go. 
[00:05:00]  So it's not like one of those three-day weekends where you're just kind of hanging around the house.  No.  Yeah.  So it was...  And you push it, too.  Well, you do push it.  I was pushing it.  And that Monday...  Meaning pushing it on a Sunday, by the way.  Yeah, yeah. On a Sunday.  Especially when the weather is really nice like it was yesterday.  Yeah.  Why would you start your commute back home?  Yeah.  So you push it as long as you can.  And then finally you start heading back toward the city.  That's the rough part. 
[00:05:30]  I was able to spend Sunday at home, which was good.  Monday evening, pretty much, I woke up.  Oh, wow. Really?  Yeah.  Already went into the early hours?  Yeah, yeah.  I do remember walking up the stairs from the poker game, which ended the festivities.  And it was that nice blue color outside.  Oh, nice.  And the birds were chirping and tweeting.  That's 6 o'clock, by the way.  I went to bed.  Yeah.  I know that time. 
[00:06:00]  Went to bed.  And I did wake up at 10 o'clock in the morning with, I guess, some railroad workers were driving  spikes into my head.  I don't know how they got there, what they were doing, but they were driving spikes.  As I grabbed some Excedrin.  And when I walked downstairs, my house looked like it had been ransacked.  Did you tweet that shit?  It was, no, because I, like I said, I had to get back to the railroad workers.  Oh, but that's the stuff I would love to see, man. 
[00:06:30]  In bed.  It was a disaster.  Did it look like the hangover?  Hey, it looked like the hangover two.  After the night of shenanigans?  Hangover two, let me tell you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just a disaster.  Oh, man, you should have tweeted a picture of that.  I would love to see that.  If that was, if I had.  You should do a before and after next time.  Before and after would be good.  After one of these big parties.  Well, believe me, there'll probably be more opportunities during the summer.  It was, I just went back up. 
[00:07:00]  I looked around.  I just went like, oh, my God.  And I just crawled back into bed until like five o'clock in the afternoon.  Oh, my God.  It was a beautiful day yesterday.  What time did you guys play cards until?  That's great.  Hmm?  What time did you guys play until?  I guess until six in the morning.  Wow.  And yeah.  And then I was done.  Wow.  And I just noticed as I walked upstairs, too, like there were people asleep passed out  on the couches and floors and a flop house, a flop house into a flop house after one of 
[00:07:30]  your parties.  I know one point Janine fell in the jacuzzi.  Oh, that's good.  She was like fully clothed.  She walked out and just fell into the jacuzzi.  How do you fall into a jacuzzi?  And this is after she just broke a glass outside.  She's looking around.  Oh, she is a disaster to have at a party.  What a drunk.  Oh, my God.  What a drunk she is.  I was in the jacuzzi and she fell into it.  We're just chit-chatting.  Oh, boy.  And she just stands up and I hear like, ooh, ooh, ooh.  And she falls.  She fucking collapses into the jacuzzi. 
[00:08:00]  Falls into the jacuzzi.  With all of her clothes on.  And before that, she was showing bruises on her knees and legs where she had fallen  at previous parties.  So it's like, all right.  Well, as long as you're having a good time.  I love Janine.  Oh, she was lovely.  Thank God it wasn't.  She's out of her mind.  Thank God it wasn't the old Janine.  You would have lost all the water in the jacuzzi.  Oh, I know.  The old Janine.  Yeah.  The water displacement would have been quite.  Bit of weight and kept it off over the years.  I've always encouraged Janine, but I had to get one in there, didn't I? 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  Yes.  She looks great.  So she sent a text to me yesterday.  A sorry text?  No, no.  It was actually, I think I left my sunglasses and my dignity in your yard.  If you find either, please let me know.  Ah, good.  I said, I found your sunglasses.  Dignity.  Sorry.  Not a chance.  She goes, it's probably in the jacuzzi.  Yeah, I got an email from her.  You did?  An apologizing email.  Apologize.  Oh, God.  There's no apologies necessary at one of those parties because everybody is just, you know, 
[00:09:00]  fucked up.  Was Jimmy the only sober one there?  Yeah.  But I think Jimmy...  Did you find any sober friends at Anthony's house?  I did.  It was just degrees of blacked out.  Yeah.  No, I did not.  He had to go to the one person probably that wasn't as fucked up.  Right.  You know.  Hold on.  He was having a nice chat with Melinda for a while and she doesn't have to be drunk to  be fucked up because she's a psychopath.  She's truly nuts.  But I literally have never talked to her in 11 years that I've known her. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the longest chat I've ever had with her.  You've never talked to her?  I've talked to her, hi and bye.  Hey, how are you?  Yeah.  That's the only conversation I've ever had with her.  She's hilarious.  She's very funny.  Yeah.  I'm fucking bummed I missed her.  She's batshit crazy.  Yeah.  But, you know, she's hilarious.  She was over there with her boyfriend, Wally, and then, you know, we had a...  People come over there.  A lot of food.  It was good.  Well, we're trying to find the apology.  I'm going to find the apology.  The apology is great.  I've got to hear the apology.  Lots of burgers.  Mike, Mike the cop, got to say thanks to him because he ran the grill the whole night 
[00:10:00]  and it was great.  Oh, good.  He did a good job on all that.  The steaks and chicken and stuff.  And it was...  My brother came by with a small little system, set it up in the fire pit area and did some  acoustic tunes.  So we were all warbling at like one in the morning.  Oh, what do the neighbors think?  Fuck the neighbors.  You got a nice big house, but the neighbors are a bit close for that crap.  I think the neighbors...  Do you invite the neighbors?  Do you do that old gag?  No, no, no. 
[00:10:30]  You don't do that old gag?  Like, come on over?  No, no.  I don't think they'd fit in.  I've met the neighbors.  They don't seem the type.  But they wouldn't come over, but at least they would feel like, oh, okay, we can be part  of this.  They might put it...  As I look around the yard as a party's going on, I know any joke or racial epithet, a remark  can be blurted out with nary a worry that anyone's going to be offended.  So if the neighbors come over, there's kind of a group that I might not be able to touch 
[00:11:00]  on.  You know.  They must hate you.  We played until way after one o'clock in the morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was way after.  Here's my apology email.  Oh, cool.  Here's the subject.  Fucking ew.  That's Jameen.  I was worse than my usual clumsy boob of a self last night.  I started off the day and should not have drank that way.  I know I annoyed you in the hot tub. 
[00:11:30]  Feel like an asshole.  I am sorry.  She was literally sitting an inch from my face in the hot tub.  An inch?  An inch?  What?  Face to face?  No.  I was...  Who was it?  I was in...  No, I would imagine.  There was like four...  Three of us or four of us in the tub.  Yeah.  And it just kept getting narrower and narrower.  Because at one point, I'm sitting there. 
[00:12:00]  Janine falls in.  She's an inch away from me.  And who was on my...  I know Melinda was there, but I don't think she was directly on my right.  There was...  Yeah.  It had shifted around a few times depending on who was in it.  Joe Curry was in there.  Joe Curry was fine.  Joe Curry was Joe Curry.  Yeah.  Who was the guy that got in?  I don't know his name.  Oh, it might have been Finn?  I don't know his name.  But he was just...  He's just a big man. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, it wasn't him then.  And he just...  No, no, no.  Not him.  I know him.  Yeah, yeah.  Obnoxious poker guy.  I like a certain amount of space.  And it's fun for me to watch when women...  And...  See that body of yours?  No, no, no.  That's...  I was just trying to...  No, no.  You can't even tell on the tub because they're going to get wet seeing it, but you can never...  Do you...  So you break out the swim trunks, Jimmy?  I don't care, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, you know...  Yeah.  But they're...  No, no.  It's fun for me to watch when a man is sitting close to a woman and they are slowly getting 
[00:13:00]  creeped out and moving away.  And it's an amazing dance to watch.  Yeah.  When a guy is trying to touch someone, not sexually, not grab her tits, nothing that extreme, but  just little foot bumps and things that you know that they don't want.  Right.  And then at one point they have to just get up and move across. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  The jacuzzi is very secretive.  Under the bubbles, you don't know what's going on.  Oh, boy.  It's crazy.  At one point she had to get up and move.  Had to get up and move.  Yeah.  It was funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was kind of funny.  Well, you know, you do get some of that going on.  I don't know how that happens.  What time did you get out of there, Jimmy?  I left at, I want to say three-something.  I went down and watched them play poker for a few, and I debated it, but I'm like, I just...  I don't know how to play, there's a few people I don't know, I was like, I was having a spatial 
[00:14:00]  thing, like, I can't have my fucking, like, I get crazy when someone is, my space is, I  get fucking, it does something to me, like, it makes me want to scream and scratch my face.  Yeah, there are, there are, you know, certain...  If I don't know people, I get fucking very weird.  Element, certain couple of people that are a little on the periphery...  I get very weird.  ...of invitations, and, you know, people show up and things...  Yeah, it's like when you're having a nice chat about something, and somebody comes over 
[00:14:30]  and begins talking about something totally...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just total nonsense.  Totally different.  And you're like, do you not notice that we're not engaged in this?  We're both zoned out, like, fucking...  We're children, and you're molesting us?  Do you not notice that?  I'm looking at the house...  But it makes it worse that you're not drunk.  Yeah.  It makes it a lot worse when you're a sober guy.  Everything's worse when you're sober.  At my house, everything's worse when you're sober.  It was fun, though.  I had a great time.  It was a very fun time. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, we had a great time, yeah.  But, you know, there's just certain elements that I get fucking, drive me nuts.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't, and maybe if I was drunk, it wouldn't bother me.  I know what you mean.  Was it career stuff they wanted to talk about when you were into some other conversation?  No, um...  It's just Budinsky conversation.  We were talking about...  Tranny?  Poker.  No, no, that would have been great.  I'd talk about tranny until the cows came home, as it were.  We were talking about poker, and the addictive nature of it, and how I don't gamble. 
[00:15:30]  And I was asked...  Why?  Melinda asked me, do you want to play poker?  Oh.  And I'm like, no, here's why.  I'm too compulsive.  But we got into that whole thing.  Yeah.  I don't trust myself.  And then somebody comes over and starts talking about...  I think it all gets the gist of what we're talking about, and then starts talking about  how he's afraid to behave a certain way sexually, because he doesn't want to be compulsive sexually.  What?  And it was kind of bizarre.  And at one point... 
[00:16:00]  What do you mean?  I don't want to blow up anyone's spot, but what point...  He didn't say anything.  Like, he didn't say anything that was...  No, it's just right on the periphery of creepy.  Right.  It was like...  But it's your house.  At one point, I actually...  Yeah, but you know, that's when people come over.  And he's...  They're creepy.  Is it getting easier and easier to get in your house?  I'm starting to think.  No, no, no, but I keep it pretty tight, but sometimes, you know...  Every once in a while, one gets through.  Yeah, and then you get a little booze flowing, and some people that normally are all right  get over the line a little bit. 
[00:16:30]  It was uncomfortable.  And literally, I was staring at the neighbor's house, and she was looking straight up.  And that's when I was like, do you not know?  At one point, I go, this is a 20-minute dissertation on your loads.  And then...  Yeah, yeah.  Don't need that.  I wasn't angry.  I was just like...  I didn't know what to say to it.  Obviously, the guy can't read body language.  No, no, no.  You've got to be able to read body language if you're out and about.  And if you realize people are looking up or away or turning their body slightly, they  don't want anything to do with you, and you should politely remove yourself from the situation. 
[00:17:00]  But it wasn't that it was this in-depth, amazing...  But it wasn't an amazing conversation.  I don't even know.  It was a gambling chat.  But for it to have gone...  To go there.  And we don't know each other that well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like it was somebody I know for 10 years.  At one point, Melissa, like, I was kind of looking around.  I go, oh, where'd Melissa go? 
[00:17:30]  So I go upstairs, and she's just in bed, like, with the covers over her.  And I went, you feel okay?  And I think she goes, I just had to get out of there for a little while.  She goes, I just can't talk to people.  How many people were there?  I don't know.  At any given moment, you know, some people, more people were showing up.  But it wasn't one of these giant, you know, out-of-control, lots of crowd.  But it was, you know, there were a few people there.  It was pretty good. 
[00:18:00]  But it was just like, what the...  She goes, no, I'll be down a little later.  I'm just taking a breather.  I'm taking a nap.  Yeah, you got to take a little breather from it.  And, yeah, we just...  Yeah, we had a great time.  It was a lot of fun and everything.  But, you know, every...  There's got to be a better screening process.  There's got to be more of a monkey wrench.  Oh, Jimmy's saying it.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  A little bit, huh?  Whatever.  Yeah, I think so.  That's how...  Maybe I shouldn't put the invite out on Twitter.  Yeah.  He's such a nice dude.  He doesn't want to toss people out.  But I do have the Twitter invite, you know, and it says, you know who you are. 
[00:18:30]  But some of those people assume they know who they are.  I think that's what happens.  And that's what Jimmy's getting at.  And then you're too nice to go, eh.  You're not.  I think that might be what happens sometimes.  I gotta ask Jimmy, do you get the itch when you're in a party situation like that?  No, but I did when I got home.  You want to smoke or something?  No.  I had a smoking and drinking dream when I got home.  Oh, of course.  I haven't had one of those years, though.  But of course.  A long time.  Yeah, everyone's smoking and drinking. 
[00:19:00]  What made me think of, uh...  Ugh.  Sorry.  I saw a photo.  No, Janine, it's not you.  She's just horrified.  I've been watching her video here, her live feed, and she just has her face planted in  her hands in complete and utter embarrassment.  She probably fell into them.  She wasn't.  I'm not talking about Janine.  Could you tell her that she's not allowed to hold my son anymore after this conversation?  We'll make her blow into a tube first to make sure she's fucking sober. 
[00:19:30]  We run into her every once in a while at the Walt Whitman Mall.  Literally?  Does she run into you?  She's done that with the columns at my house, too, by the way.  She just walks straight into them.  For now on, she doesn't hold my son.  I'm sorry.  You could admire her from afar for a while.  Sounds like this Janine has some problems now.  She just needs a breathalyzer around at all times.  Oh, the fuck am I?  It was hilarious.  But if you're at a big-time party, of course you're going to dream about it when you get 
[00:20:00]  home.  Yeah, but I normally don't.  I had a smoking dream the other night where I wake up and I'm panicked like, oh my god,  I smoked.  Oh, wait, it was a dream.  That's good.  I dreamt that I bought cigarettes and I dreamt that I was drinking again and telling myself,  like, you're going to be okay.  You're fine.  Like, I knew I fucked up.  I wish I could remember the circumstances, but it was after the, something was said that  made me think of it, or the pot, something we were talking about that made me think of  like, yeah, it'd be kind of cool to smoke pot. 
[00:20:30]  Smoke some weed.  Yeah, I don't remember what, maybe it was watching everybody downstairs have a few drinks,  or I just don't know.  But that's another reason, too.  It's like, I stay for a while, but the pool is easy.  But it's like, when people, everyone's around the table, that's more of a drinking.  It's all drinking.  Like, the basement's another thing, because, you know, you walk down the stairs to get  beers for outside, and you realize, like, half the party is at the bar downstairs.  Oh, really?  So, yeah, I walk in, and everybody's drinking, and the pet from Monocle's, like, ah, knocking 
[00:21:00]  some back.  And you just look and go, like, oh, okay, there's people down here, too.  And that's more of a just plain drinking.  They're fucking down there with a bottle of Jameson, just doing shots, shots after shots,  drinking down Guinness and Jameson, and then upstairs at the pool, it's more of a, you  know, just beers.  Just chilling at home.  And then there's the pool, so you can just, you know, talk with people and float around  on a little floaty mats.  It doesn't feel like a drinking atmosphere in the pool. 
[00:21:30]  Or even when you're sitting at the tables eating or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something about the basement at late.  It's pure, that's just pure drinking.  And I can hang there.  It's a bar.  But after a while, it's like.  You're in a bar.  I gotta go back to the neighbors.  What do they do?  Do they ever call the cops?  Well, the Asian neighbors behind us are very nice, because they sacrifice up their semi-clad  daughter to stand in the window, which was great last night.  At one point, we all went, holy shit, look in the window.  And there's a giant picture window in the middle of the house, second floor, and there's 
[00:22:00]  the college-age daughter, just slamming body on her, too, in her panties and bra, like  hanging something on the wall.  She's gotta know.  And we're all just like, there's a loud party going on.  She's gotta know.  There's tiki torches lit, so the yard looks like it's on fire.  Looks like there's been a napalm strike in my yard.  And, yeah, of course, there's music being played into all hours.  Holy shit.  And she's in the window, standing on something, reaching up, trying to hang something at 1.30 
[00:22:30]  in the morning.  She wants to be invited to the party.  Maybe.  She should've knocked on that door.  Yeah, sure.  I wasn't gonna knock on that door.  How old is she?  Then we're going to get into the we-hate-driving conversation, and I can't talk about her.  Yeah, that would...  You know, kind of...  Wow, she obviously knows.  Something's going on, because I've seen her completely naked in her bedroom window.  That wasn't her bedroom.  That was maybe her, another room that she has.  What do you mean completely naked?  I've seen her completely... 
[00:23:00]  I know her completely naked, but how does that happen?  Completely naked.  She just has all the shades and everything open?  Shades open.  She's laying on her bed.  Her bed comes above the bottom of the window.  So she's laying on bed naked on her computer, right?  Right.  And this was a while ago.  This wasn't last night.  But me and Danny had a fight over the binoculars, and Danny got custody of the binoculars, and  I'm like, fuck, I had to break out my .50 cal with the scope and lean it on the kitchen 
[00:23:30]  island and use the scope to get magnification to look at her naked.  She's like 18?  In the window.  Yeah, she's a college girl or some shit.  She's pretty?  So, yeah, she had a, you know, a nice ass, you know, for that bill.  It's very difficult to find a really nice ass on that.  The entire continent has two.  Yeah, yeah.  God, she knows.  Obviously perky and everything.  She knows people are looking at her.  Maybe.  Come on, maybe.  Maybe.  But I've never seen... 
[00:24:00]  I've seen her once playing like some kind of a volleyball thing in the backyard with some  of her college friends, girls and stuff.  But that was maybe a year ago, and now I never see her outside the house.  She's never in the yard.  She's never there.  The only time I've seen her is semi-clad and nude in her window.  That's wild.  Yeah.  That's pretty hot.  So that's, you know, that's a good neighbor to have.  But the other neighbors on the other side, I just, I don't think they'd be into the hijinks  and shenanigans that go on at the house. 
[00:24:30]  They got kids, they, you know...  They probably leave now every holiday weekend.  They're probably getting the hell out of there.  Yeah, one of the neighbors, the one that years ago called the cops on me, the diagonal back  neighbor.  I think she was around during the day, because I heard some classic rock they like to listen  to over there.  But after that, everyone just shut up.  Their lights are all off.  It's like they left town.  They just battened down the hatches and waited out. 
[00:25:00]  But your fucking brother got me so hooked on a fucking song.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah, my brother's been getting into these weird, like, old school Johnny Cash and that  kind of, like, music from other artists and stuff.  Just this weird kind of eclectic shit that'll do acoustically and stuff.  What song was it?  God, I wish I could remember.  I remember it.  Oh, you do?  Is it a Johnny Cash song?  No, no, no, no, no.  It's a song called Dirty Old Town. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, right, right.  And I'm like, who sings that?  And he's like, uh, the Pogues.  Right, right.  Oh, that's why you were tweeting that.  Yes.  Joe had played an acoustic.  I'm like, why is he talking about the Pogues all of a sudden?  And the Pogues, that guy's teeth, wow.  I like the video.  There's a video of them singing it at fucking self-aid.  Let me see.  I'll show you which one it is.  I've probably watched it.  It had probably 10,000 views when I saw it.  It's got over 600,000 now.  I don't know the Pogues.  I don't either.  That much. 
[00:26:00]  It's weird.  They're fucking hardcore, just fucking like, bleh.  The guy's teeth are falling out of his head.  He's just fucking a wreck.  Just go to YouTube and find, go to Dirty Old Town.  It's a faster version than this.  No, I want to play this in a break while we're done here.  Yeah, it's the fucking guy.  Play the whole fucking song.  You never pick songs for the show.  It's the third one down.  Third one down.  Fucking mouth.  Is...  All right, go with that one.  Fade out that one.  He's a fucking horribly ugly man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Have you seen him? 
[00:26:30]  No, yeah, I know what he looks like.  I've never seen him.  Really?  I was like, what the, who is this guy?  Wow, look at all those fucking people.  A bunch of hooligans.  And there's one moment where there's an Irish couple dancing and like a fucking white people.  We're terrible.  We're just horrible.  I met my love by the Gusworks wall.  Look at this guy's team.  It's the greatest.  Dreams, I dream by the old canal. 
[00:27:00]  The canal.  No.  I kiss my girl by the factory wall.  Factory.  Factory.  Factory.  Dirty old town.  Dirty old town.  Louder train.  Yeah, look at these dummies dancing.  That is bad.  They're all drunk.  Of course.  But so proud.  Rolling on their face. 
[00:27:30]  There's one second in this video where he gets something in his throat and he moves his head and you can hear one.  Yeah, he's hacking and spitting.  Getting some nicotine out.  Yeah.  Dirty old town.  Shit, though.  The fucking joke got me into this.  Yeah.  God damn it, Joe.  You can just turn me on to this now.  It's fucking great.  And a tootly-doo horn.  But look at him smoking and drinking.  They're all playing.  He's not dancing like a fucking front man.  He's actually smoking and drinking out of a fucking L and L glass.  This guy's got a little tootly-doo piccolo thing. 
[00:28:00]  And a cigarette behind his ear.  Cigarette behind his ear, whatever it is.  As soon as his little solo's done, he's going to light up.  He's going to smoke.  These guys love cigarettes.  I think there's a woman on stage who I believe is Elvis Costello's wife.  I could be wrong.  Yeah, because I looked her up because she's really cute.  Oh, right.  She's the one that's like, you're thinking, what's she doing there?  I heard a sign from the top.  Yeah.  I saw a train set the night on fire. 
[00:28:30]  Smell the spring.  You know the microphone must smell?  From the 60s, huh?  Yeah, she's cute.  Oh, this is 1986.  This is the thing.  But this is 25 years old?  Yes.  What the fuck?  Shining steel.  Oh, it's one of those aid contests. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, uh, concerts.  It's a self-aid.  Self-aid.  How about, it should be fucking tooth-aid.  Of course it should be.  American Dentistry Society.  Oh, he's a mess.  He's worse now, though.  I was Googling videos of him.  Oh, yeah, he's just fucked up.  What a stumble bum.  I want to see what he looks like now.  It's bad.  I heard he got new teeth.  Did he?  Yeah.  Wasn't that his thing?  Yeah, I guess so.  Shane McGowan. 
[00:29:30]  Shane McGowan, yeah.  McGowan.  I've heard of him, and I knew that was kind of a...  Kind of his, what, fucking thing?  He's got a thing.  They're hard teeth.  Yeah, but they're worse now.  Poges never had radio success, but always had a huge fan base.  I've gotten them on the Boneyard requested.  I don't know if I've played them, and now I certainly will.  You can tell.  They look like those fake teeth you put in.  If you want to scare people, right?  Yeah.  I fucking like that song.  That's great. 
[00:30:00]  That's a good one.  Yeah, I like that version of it better than the studio version.  That goes on my iTunes immediately.  My brother's fucking, like, ridiculous when it comes to playing.  He's great.  Like, anything he can play.  That's what he looks like now?  Oh, my God.  He looks like Lemmy a little from the nose up.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, wow.  Is that where he's in picture?  Oh, he's all fat now?  Look at him.  Wow, what a disaster.  Yeah, he's a...  Oh, shit.  He looks...  Shit.  He's got crazy eyes.  He's a hardcore drunk.  Damn, man.  How the fuck is he still alive? 
[00:30:30]  Look at this guy.  Holy shit.  He doesn't...  He looks just as bad, but completely different.  And you were wrong about the new teeth.  He has no teeth.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard he's gotten new teeth.  Unless he got that very recently.  His chippers.  Wow.  Oh, he does look like Tippi Tom a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Man, this thing is talking about a dirty old cow.  Yeah.  Dirty old underpants.  Dirty old underpants.  They're pretty popular, the Pogues, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they got one of those hardcore fucking followings. 
[00:31:00]  Timmy K writes, dirty old mouth.  Dirty old mouth.  It's a horrible...  Dude, his...  That is a horrible face.  Breath must be fucking...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There's just a couple of...  He looks like he has cigarette butts in his mouth.  His teeth.  His teeth are just rotting.  Holy shit, they're rotting.  Look at that one that's about, like, two inches long.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  Mucus dripping.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  There's a smell coming out of that mouth.  Hold on.  I gotta tweet this.  That is a bad one.  Keep that close out.  Yeah, that does look like meth mouth.  Those are fucking terrible.  Oh, wow.  Is that bad?  I read that Sinead O'Connor called the cops on him because he was to stop them from doing  heroin years ago, and he was mad, but he said he stopped them.  Yeah, because I guess he was doing a lot of dope, too.  And I guess she was pals with him or something?  Yeah.  They do a duet together in some movie.  Oh, really?  Yeah, some song they did together, which is not bad. 
[00:32:00]  Someone was on Wikipedia this weekend.  I really was, dude, because I had never heard of the band.  I mean, I've heard of them, but I've never listened to them.  Yeah, I never listened.  Dirty old town.  But they're hardcore Irish.  Wow.  One of their songs was in The Wire in the fucking funeral scene, like on the pool table.  That was a Pokes song.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Where they played that Irish tune.  That was Pokes.  Oh, that's fucking cool.  So I had a mild, mild familiarity with them.  But I'm like, how did you do that?  And Joe was playing that at the party?  Dirty old town.  Nice.  I'm like, what is that? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  My brother's got a cool rig now that's, like, so small.  And it's great for, like, a small little acoustic gathering.  Takes them two minutes to fucking set up.  No PA, no fucking big thing.  And it works.  Sounds great.  We were all just warbling songs and fucking around.  And it was a good time.  I thought about you and your brother, like, from the old days, the band days.  Oh, yeah.  Because, by the way, I was invited to Ant's party, so people should relax.  Of course.  Even Jimmy called me.  I texted you before I left. 
[00:33:00]  I already had plans.  I was hoping I would make it to your party, but I already had some things.  And it was kind of a last minute.  I put the word out, like, yeah.  You know, because I wasn't sure of the weather, too.  The weather was supposed to be shitty.  By Thursday, they were saying the weekend weather's going to be shitty.  And then it turned out to be pretty cool.  I was getting on one of those ferries, and the band was loading in on the ferry for their gig.  And I was thinking, goddammit, that was Ant and his brother way back in the day.  Going over to fucking watch the show.  And I was studying the guys, and I'm like, oh, these guys think that just they're going to get that one break. 
[00:33:30]  The break coming.  And that's it.  They got the big break.  Is it coming?  And then I heard them later on during the weekend, and they were just playing some fucking bomb secret song.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What are you going to do?  Your destiny is made, sir.  We did the air show Saturday.  Yeah.  Went out on Keith's boat.  Went out by, it's right in the waters out there, by Jones Beach Theater, by the Needle out there.  Oh, the serial killer dumping ground. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, serial killer dumping ground slash air show.  I was in the serial killer dumping ground just to join you with this story.  And the whole time, I'm wondering if I'm going to get a whiff of a dead body that they haven't found yet.  One little breeze hits, you know, like, for a split second.  Hey, wait a minute.  I think that's dead people.  I hope the rest of the country understands what you're about to say and where I was.  This is where everyone goes.  Yeah.  It's very popular beaches and clubs and all that shit.  And I was walking around going, I wonder if I'm going to sniff something that they haven't found yet. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Now that the summer's here, it's creepy.  All those stories in the news reports during the, you know, the early spring, late winter, who cares?  But now we're back in those areas.  Yeah.  It's fucking creepy.  But anyway, you're at the air show.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty cool.  I was a little bummed because I guess the Blue Angels are grounded.  Why?  They got grounded.  Well, their head guy, the leader, the team leader, he got in trouble for a low altitude, flying at too low altitude at the last air show.  Really?  So they gave him the boot and they're all tied up. 
[00:35:00]  And then there was supposed to be an F-22 Raptor there.  And then the whole F-22 fleet got grounded for some mechanical difficulties.  But we did have A-10, Warthog, which are cool as fuck, P-51 Mustang, B-29, an old school B-29, B-17.  And then an F-A-18 that came out and did some high speed passes and shit.  And we've gotten so used to having cameras that are right there on your phone, instantaneous. 
[00:35:30]  You can take a picture, you know, if you're on the street and shit like that.  But you don't realize until you have a good fucking camera how much you sacrifice with these little cameras.  Of course.  Because you're taking a picture at an air show and you know what you're getting?  Nothing.  A dot in the sky.  Right.  So Melissa had her cannon out with her.  And she's taking pictures of these planes that were fucking unbelievable.  She took a picture of the A-10, which looked like a speck in the sky most of the time, moving at very high speed. 
[00:36:00]  She took a picture where you zoom in and see the fucking pilot.  No.  The pilot's in there.  Wow.  Dude, you see his oxygen mask on the pilot.  That's the detail.  And an F-18 doing a knife edge pass where you see the vapor being sucked out of the air above the wings.  Just cool-ass fucking pictures.  I'm like, you ought to be a gunner.  How low are these things?  At some points, they're real fucking low within a few hundred feet of the water. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, wow.  And other times.  Well, the F-18 will be that low.  And then within seconds, it's as high as where airliners are at like in the 20s and 30,000s of feet.  And then back again.  He goes, all right, he's going to take another pass back.  He's going to swing around.  By swing around, they mean that fucker flies like over Manhattan, turns around, and he's back within like a minute.  But the amount of distance these things cover are astounding. 
[00:37:00]  Is that the wow plane?  At the speed.  Yeah, yeah, the wow plane.  Linger longer.  The biplane.  And we were listening to the simulcast on one of these Long Island radio stations.  WBAB.  Dude, that's what I thought it was going to be.  It was even worse.  It was some horrid station.  He's falling.  And this guy, yeah.  Oh, that's what they do.  They get the planes, especially these aerobatic planes, the propeller or biplanes, even the monowing planes.  They throw the plane around where they'll be flying. 
[00:37:30]  They go straight up and then like fling the rudder around where the plane just starts spinning in the sky.  Look at how the wings not rip off.  Look at him.  He just flung his plane upside down.  And how does that not?  How do you know where you are?  I'm like, how do you not fling the wings off the plane?  How do you know where you are?  You just got to read your instruments, obviously.  A lot of times it's, yeah, you know you're going up.  You know what your altitude is going into it.  So you'll know what it is coming out of it. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  And all you got to do is get your nose back down, get the speed up and pull out.  But a lot of these guys also, some of the aerobatic planes have markings on the canopy.  And they know them by heart.  So they'll look out the side and see a certain markings lined up with the horizon and know exactly where they are.  Oh, wow.  At a certain time.  My question is, how do you start doing that?  I always wonder that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you have to get in one of those and do your first trick.  Yeah.  What is it?  Just an easy rollover or something?  It's probably something pretty easy, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Fast forward a year and you're flipping and flopping and throwing the plane all over the sky.  There was one plane that had so much power and it was so light that he went into a climb and just stayed there hovering with his plane just using the propeller thrust to hold him in a hover.  In one place, he's just sitting there.  Wah!  Wow.  Straight up and down.  That's pretty awesome.  It was amazing.  And people said they were having, my buddy Joe Curry said he was having a great time at Republic Airport where all these planes were taken off from just watching them, you know, watching that side of it. 
[00:39:00]  Watching them taxi around and take off and shit.  But, you know, you get up close and see like a fucking, there's one B-29 left that's still flying in this country called Fifi.  Fifi.  And it's a real, you know, old school World War II B-29.  They restored B-17s.  Just watch those old planes.  A P-51 Mustang flying wingtip to wingtip with an A-10 Warthog.  Yeah, you see that thing take off?  You're not allowed that fucking thing. 
[00:39:30]  Just go straight up, right?  Yeah, straight up.  Look at that thing.  Just ballistics straight the fuck up.  Upside down.  Just giving Long Island a show.  Why don't you do that experience?  I never thought of it, to tell you the truth.  You should.  I never even gave two thoughts to actually going to Republic Airport and watching these things take off.  No, be in one of these.  Oh, in them?  You can.  Yeah, that's another thing.  The Blue Angels experience, whatever it is.  Hey, look, I just got into a fucking race car and did that.  This would be a little different. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, speaking of race cars, did that guy really fucking crash on the last lap?  Yes.  I don't watch the Indy 500 every year.  Oh, fuck.  But I'm kind of bummed I didn't watch this year.  The guy...  Oh, JR.  Yeah, he...  He had the race and he crashes on the last lap?  He had it.  He won the fucking thing.  Were you watching this thing?  No, I saw the replay.  I was outside having a party.  Right.  But he comes around the last turn.  He's way in the lead, right?  He's totally in the lead.  No one's going to get him.  No one's on his ass.  No one's going to get him. 
[00:40:30]  He's going around.  He just passed the main stretch.  I haven't seen this yet.  Now he's in the back stretch.  Okay.  It's an oval.  Now he goes into turn three.  Right.  Comes out of turn...  Everything is good so far.  Now, the problem is he's lapping somebody, and I think for a split second, that's all  it takes.  I think he got distracted.  But why did he have to even lap the guy at that point?  Well...  He has a really big lead.  Well, the guy he's lapping is going pretty slow.  And he's like, all right, I'm going to lap him around the corner.  He gets distracted, I think, and loses his line and hits the fucking wall. 
[00:41:00]  Are you fucking...  What a dummy.  You'd hope the momentum would take him across the first line.  And that's it.  Yeah, look, because the finish line's right there.  Where?  Oh, what a...  Oh, my...  It's right there.  It's right there.  Now he's 31st.  It's right there.  Oh, what a dope.  And this guy's like, holy shit, I just won the Indy 500, but because that guy crashed.  And he's like, holy shit, I lost because I just crashed.  What place did crash guy come in?  I don't know.  Because he made it across the finish line.  He did slide across.  It looks like only three or four cars passed him. 
[00:41:30]  He came in second?  I think that's what it is.  Yeah, he came in second.  He slid across in his shit car second.  Pretty impressive he was able to get across the line with a tire sideways.  Total momentum, yeah.  What a fool.  What did he say about it?  I don't know what the story is behind it, but that was a bad mistake.  What did he have?  He was a split second away from winning the Indy 500.  At that speed, that's one fucking second, and you're the winner.  For the rest of his life, he's going to see that long. 
[00:42:00]  And for the rest of his life, he's going to be like, oh my God, what did I do?  He just fucked up.  Might make him more famous, though.  He fucked up.  Is that something you just don't see every day?  They'll be showing this clip.  Not even the last lap.  It's one thing to be on turn one of the last lap or something and be like, oh, fuck.  Or there's someone right on your ass.  But this guy, first of all, he didn't have to drive so aggressively with no one behind him right on his ass.  Is he a rookie or something?  He comes around.  He is, right?  He lost concentration. 
[00:42:30]  I swear.  You look at, he's passing that other guy.  But that guy right, oh, that's the winner.  Yeah, that other guy is being lapped, so that's the winner.  Here it is.  Look, he passes him.  Gotcha.  And you can see he's swinging out.  Wham!  Oh, it's the wall on the right side, obviously.  Looks like the front end kind of lost it for a clip.  It went like, boop.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Me being a professional race car driver now.  Wait, so that's the car he passed.  So that's not going to be.  Yeah, that's not going to be it.  Hold on.  So.  Here comes first place, guys. 
[00:43:00]  That's first place.  Yay.  That's the car he passed.  Lapped cars.  Second place.  Second place.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  They got to be like, are you shitting me?  That's the team that won.  Oh, no.  That's his team.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  God damn it.  I don't know what happened.  Oh, my God.  Son of a bitch.  Fucking.  He had it won.  Wow.  For the rest of his life, he'll regret that.  He was less than a quarter mile from the finish.  Yeah, he fucked up.  That's a second away. 
[00:43:30]  That's like, one second.  Ah, you win.  Ah, no.  Second earlier.  No.  Nobody cares about being more famous.  Like, the agony of defeat guy, he doesn't look at it like, hey, that clip was all over  Why World of Sports.  Yeah.  Who cares?  He's like, I fucking lost.  The joke was, I bet he wishes it was the Indy 499.  That's a good joke.  You know, or the Indy 200 or something.  Ah, he's even smaller.  That's why I said that.  Right.  Ah, let me say hi to Tom in Huntington. 
[00:44:00]  Tom.  You.  Let's go, brother.  Hi, Tom.  What's going on?  You guys didn't watch the NASCAR race later on that day with Dale Earnhardt Jr. ran out of  gas at the last turn?  Ah, shit.  Earnhardt out of fuel.  On the last turn?  190 down to about a buck.  Oh, he ran out of gas.  Was he in the lead?  Yeah, he was in first place.  What a weird fucking weekend for racing.  He was ready to win?  Ready to win. 
[00:44:30]  He already had his campaign out.  Damn.  So what place did he come in?  Ah, 31st.  Oh, he didn't even make it over the...  He made it over, but he had to keep it at like 1,000 RPM or something.  Oh, so he barely...  So two crazy finishes this weekend.  I think Adam Ferraro waved the green flag at that race.  Did he?  To start him all up.  I saw a video.  That's pretty cool.  Of him like waving the flag and he's all happy like a little kid that he is.  Ooh!  Adam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he's on that show Top Gear. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you, Tom.  And there you have it.  Wow.  I didn't know he ran out of gas.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That seems to be a real fucking error on the part of the team.  You know?  Maybe if he pitted, he would have fucking used up too much time and wouldn't have won anyway.  If you talk to hardcore NASCAR guys, I bet you they would tell you, you know, that should  happen more because they're really trying to figure it out to the drop sometimes.  Yeah, that's just it. 
[00:45:30]  They miscalculated, obviously, so someone's going to be in...  You probably thought like, you know, you could come in and refuel and really, you know, have  a hard time getting back in at first or give it a try, you know, cross your fingers, hope  you got it.  Right.  And then whoopsie.  Wow.  Can we talk about horse herpes when we get back?  We'll watch this before the show.  I don't know.  I think it's hotter on the little pogo ponies.  I know, but I don't understand what this story's about, but they're showing the clip 
[00:46:00]  over and over again.  It's one of these dumb county fair things.  It's these asshole contestants having to run around on hobby horses.  They call it a stick horse, I guess.  Oh, humiliating.  Because the actual horses have herpes.  Yeah, they still have horse herpes.  And they're young teens that look pretty fucking hot.  Yeah.  Little young cowgirls.  Yeah, they dress them up like little cowgirls.  And I'm not sure, but it seems to me the competition isn't so much.  Like, she looks like she's 20, but she's got braces on.  Than with a real horse.  It'll give you experience for, you know, things. 
[00:46:30]  If you happen to have a problem like this later in life, you already have the experience  of riding a stick horse.  Yeah.  You'll be riding a stick horse soon.  There are now 75 confirmed cases of horse herpes in nine western states.  What is, I mean, obviously, you know, herpes.  What is horse herpes?  I don't know.  Equine herpes virus.  Well, why can't they sit on them?  Because they're young girls.  You don't want to fuck those vaginas up that early in life. 
[00:47:00]  Just sitting on a saddle on one of these horse herpes?  Well, I doubt it.  A herpes, a horse with herpes, you get it?  I think the horse may need a rest.  Yeah, probably makes the horse ornery.  Yeah, probably the horse is probably like, ah, I got a herp.  To run with a fucking vaginal lip sore.  Yeah.  Traipsing around.  Horrid.  Fucking JonBenet on his back.  He's annoyed.  JonBenet.  We're going to get more info on that story after the break.  Yes.  We need to know.  We need to know.  All right.  I want to step aside here.  I love this.  Opie and Ant, I love you, but you don't know anything about auto racing. 
[00:47:30]  It's so obvious.  You know what?  We never said we did, dummy.  I even made a joke about the fact that I'm an expert now because I went six laps in a stock car.  That was called sarcasm, dirty, dirty move, whatever the fuck your cunt now bounced fuck name is.  Oh, you're an expert?  What do you do?  Are you a fry cook?  What do you do that you're a fucking expert?  Sit in front of a television and watch NASCAR? 
[00:48:00]  So you're a pro?  Go blow your father, you fucking queer.  Shut up.  You're so gone.  I don't need this guy in my life.  Fuck you.  Didn't we say it just before we...  We said we don't.  And then we were guessing.  We said we don't know, and I'm speculating that this might happen.  You obviously don't know.  Shut up.  And then didn't we kind of throw the word out there?  If you know a little more than us, please call. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Because we want to get to the bottom of this.  And now you obviously don't know me.  You've been watching the show or listening to the show how long?  You don't know the fact that you put something out there?  You bounced?  Fuck yourself.  This will be my...  You'll blow your father.  You'll blow your father.  Yes.  This will be my guess.  You get horse herpes.  This will be my guess.  Yeah.  I think when you go into the pit,  and you're like, fuck, we can't spend time.  I'm fueling up this motherfucking car.  We're going to give you just enough,  and we're going to hope that we can get you to the finish line, 
[00:49:00]  because that's our only choice,  because if we do give you more fuel,  you're not going to fucking make up the distance  when you get back on the track.  That's my guess.  Let's go to Steve in Rochester.  And let me say something before Steve talks,  because I don't think...  Yes.  They're not that stupid.  So I think that was a, fuck,  we can only give you just enough here,  and we've got to hope for the best,  and unfortunately they got burned.  That's going to be my guess.  What's your guess?  To that fucking idiot,  I happen to know for a fact  that times that you pit,  the time you choose to come in and pit, 
[00:49:30]  is an integral part of fucking racing.  Right.  That I do know.  We all know that.  Should we change tires on this lap?  Should we wait it out and hope for a yellow flag?  There are times that you decide whether or not to pit.  It's part of the fucking game.  So fuck you.  That's all I was saying.  Cocksucker.  I bounce him,  and then I still yell at him.  Because Dale Jr.,  I mean, he's been around.  Duh.  So obviously they were taking a chance,  and they got fucking burned.  That's what I'm going with. 
[00:50:00]  Steve in Rochester,  who seems to know more than us.  What do you got, Steve?  Hey, I'm not a big NASCAR fan,  but I was listening to the race,  and Dale's team knew that he was low on fuel,  and told them,  we're in the business to win races.  Let's go for it.  There you go.  See?  Let's go for it.  They take a chance.  It's a calculated risk.  Right.  They're doing all the numbers.  So fuck it.  I heard he came in seventh.  Seventh?  Yeah.  Not 31st.  Well, that's a lot different than first, though.  Ran out of fuel and had a fucking... 
[00:50:30]  Or is it?  Is seventh just as good?  I think seventh is just as good as first in NASCAR,  because I'm a pro and know everything.  Because we don't know nothing.  I think seven is good, too.  Cock.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Chris in Indiana.  Chris?  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  You know NASCAR?  No, I was talking about Indy,  and I know you know exactly what you're talking about,  but the reason why that guy crashed on Sunday was when he went outside, 
[00:51:00]  he was trying to lap that guy.  When you get outside that track in Indy,  he was all your traction,  and they call it getting into the marbles,  and that's exactly what that dumbass man is.  Oh, he got out of the groove.  But is he a dumbass?  It looked like he had to get past that guy somehow.  Yeah, but he had a four-second lead.  He didn't have to go around that fast and probably...  Okay.  Yeah.  He almost won the race by putting it into the wall anyway.  I mean, he had a four-second lead. 
[00:51:30]  He didn't have to do it.  All he had to do was just cruise through.  He was won.  Did the guy who was lapping,  did he have to be there in the fucking sticky part of the track?  Couldn't he have been high?  They pretty much all do.  I mean, when you're in that car going 200 miles an hour,  you need that groove.  Yeah, that slow poke wasn't going no 200 miles an hour.  That fairy Mary.  Yeah, how about that asshole fucking moves out of the way  and does the right thing for the race?  Well...  Why was he still trying to do anything if he's getting lapped?  Really?  As they're coming in. 
[00:52:00]  Couldn't disagree.  I couldn't agree with you more, man.  And let's be honest.  The Indy 500 is kind of cool to watch,  but the rest of the Indy races, who cares?  I agree.  It's all about NASCAR,  which I know that's going to piss off a lot of Indy people.  Well, I think if you're passing somebody like that  and you're going to get out of the groove for a second,  perhaps you should have backed off a little bit.  I guess I would have blamed his pit crew telling him,  man, you know, hey, you've got a four-second lead. 
[00:52:30]  You don't need to push it.  You don't need to, you know, to get across at 220, man.  Just cruise through.  You've got to...  Well, obviously there was some inexperience at play here.  Oh, yeah.  He's a rookie.  He's a rookie.  And then maybe his team were a bit on the inexperienced side, too.  They fucked up.  How did the driver with the pussy do?  The only thing that would have made her...  Was there a driver with a pussy?  Yeah, Danica.  Oh, Danica was in the race.  All right, thank you, sir.  I've got to cut you off because the guy that answers yelled at is on the line. 
[00:53:00]  Chris from West Virginia.  Chris?  What's up?  Hey, hey, Mr. Know-it-all.  Yeah.  Showed him.  What are you getting on my shit for?  Oh, come on, man.  You guys talk about racing and it's like,  Oh, well, you know, you just say stuff that is wrong.  All right, like what?  But give us an example of what was said that you went like,  Oh, that's stupid or...  I think we sort of got it.  Yeah, what's an example? 
[00:53:30]  Go ahead.  I don't know.  It's early in the morning.  Well, you just said...  You said we say stupid things and we don't know what we're talking about.  So now mention something stupid we said that we don't know what we were talking about  and then you correct us.  Yeah, you can't just...  That's how life works.  You can't just write stupid shit and then not back it up.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  We're giving you a chance to back it up.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, you know, you say like,  Oh, well, that's a problem with the team with Dale Jr.  Well, you know, I mean, 
[00:54:00]  they obviously, you know, they pack the car as much as they can, you know?  You sound stupid on the radio.  You really are just a babbling fuck.  You're an idiot.  Listen to you.  Thank you.  You can't even explain yourself.  Use words to explain yourself.  Go ahead.  Well, it's always nice to be noticed.  Well, yeah.  It's like sometimes Ant will attack somebody and we'll go, well, maybe that guy was just  saying.  But you totally justified him attacking and banning you. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't ban him.  I bounced him.  He can come back eventually.  And you don't even have anything.  Bans only go out to people of certain ethnic backgrounds.  Oh, good, good, good.  Yes, yes.  You don't have any.  You have nothing on this.  What do you think happened?  Chris, we even said it was the team's call and Dale, you know, was in touch with the team.  Everyone said, go for it.  And obviously there was, you know, it was, it was close enough where, yeah.  Do they know how much fuel is in the car? 
[00:55:00]  They don't know how much fuel is in the car.  They're communicating with each other.  So they don't know how much fuel is in the car.  What is wrong with you?  What do you think happens?  You don't think with all the calculations they make, they don't know.  Not exactly.  But they don't know how much fuel is in the car.  An experienced driver might go, holy shit, this is going to be fucking close.  What do you guys think?  And they get a little back and forth going.  And then they say, we're in the business of winning races, go for it.  So they don't count, you know, laps and speed and know how much fuel is in that car 
[00:55:30]  and ask them to come in and pit.  It's just willy-nilly like, hey, why don't you come on in and pit?  We think you might need some fuel.  Well, the guy who won the race had been pitted just around the same time as Junior.  And you know what?  He had fuel.  Well, I guess he had a little more fuel than...  He saved fuel by running at a slower pace.  You're just stupid.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  He was also saving fuel by running at a slower pace and also was in second place until Dale 
[00:56:00]  ran out of fucking gas, which no one expected that to happen.  So you saying the guy was saving fuel and figured, I'll just settle for second.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  At Kevin Harvick on the phone, he said, hey, you know what?  If I can't, if I'm not going to pass anybody, I'm just going to sit here and run.  He settled for second place. 
[00:56:30]  So drivers go out there going, I hope I just want to make second place today.  If you're point racing, yeah.  It's all about the championship.  Who cares about winning a race?  Well, they kind of want to win.  I don't know.  They kind of want to win, but you know what?  Wouldn't you rather have a championship?  Well, Kevin just texted me and he said that he was not trying to settle for second place.  Yeah, we know him.  We follow him on Twitter. 
[00:57:00]  By the way, there was four pussies in the Indy 500 this year.  Four?  Thank you, Reese.  All right, Chris.  I guess you made your point.  Yeah, kind of.  In a roundabout way.  Yeah.  Doing this radio is hard, isn't it?  Yeah, you guys should really get paid more money.  Thank you.  It's really hard.  I love the people that, you know, stay home thinking they know what they're doing.  It's tough, isn't it?  This is really hard.  Yeah, it is.  You've got to pay more money.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  We get it.  I agree.  All right, Chris.  Pay more money.  That was a great exercise, because when you do get one of these people on the phone, they have nothing.  Wow.  In the end.  Absolutely nothing.  No, I'm so close to banning him.  But I'm just going to leave him bounce, because I want to see if he comes back, you know, a tortured fucking hero.  And I'll just bounce him.  I think his life's so sad that this is all he's got, so you should ban him.  It's the only bright spot in my life.  It's the only bright spot in my life. 
[00:58:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  It's like LaMotta being thrown in jail.  It was horrible.  It was brutal.  Friday's show with Bobo was great.  He was so upset, and it was hilarious.  Why are we switching roles?  I tapped out.  You used to tap out in the old days.  You know why?  I knew we were going to let him off the hook before we left.  Yeah, but when I grabbed fucking Stalker Patty's wig back in the day, you were having 
[00:58:30]  a tough time with that, and I knew at the time that we were going to let her back.  Yeah, but there's no...  We're kind of switching roles a little bit like that.  No, no, no.  Here's the difference between those two.  Here's the difference between those two.  Yeah.  Once you took the wig, you took the wig.  She's like...  Now, there's no returning that.  Right.  The moment of utter horror with her without the wig was the moment.  But it was similar to the Bobo thing, because she thought she was done as far as the show  goes.  No, no, no.  That's why we were escorting her out and grabbing the wig at the last second.  But that isn't what upset her. 
[00:59:00]  What upset her was the fact that she was seen without the wig, and that couldn't be replaced.  She had her head shaved in front of 10,000 people.  No, no.  It was growing in, remember?  She was very upset with people seeing her.  People seeing her was the upsetting part.  That couldn't be returned.  With him saying that he's off the show, all you have to do is go, you're not off the  show anymore, and it's returned back to normal.  And he was all calm, and everything was fine.  That was the equivalent of Patty crying at the prospect of the wig being taken and not  actually being taken. 
[00:59:30]  The prospect of it.  It's like holding a gun on someone, and they're like, please don't shoot me, and you don't  shoot him.  You shot Patty, and then you're saying, yeah, but I got a medical attention.  No, you're into it more than you used to be.  No, no, just Bobo.  I think you're into it a little more than you used to be.  No, I liked it.  It was fun.  I'm not saying it's bad.  It was fun.  Someone has to play that fucking role.  No, it was fun.  Can we replay the audio?  I'll tell you what.  I would love to hear that.  There was one line in there that just got me.  Really?  Yeah, when he said there's a lot of shitty days, and you don't understand what this show 
[01:00:00]  means to people.  Oh, please.  We've all had shitty days.  You retarded.  No dick motherfucker.  I'm just telling you what got to me.  I'm not saying, you know, whatever.  If it didn't get to you, that's fine.  But that's what got to me.  I'm like, fuck.  And he was just going on and on.  I was like, shut the fuck up.  I was kind of annoyed, too.  Like, I felt bad for him, but I was like, you fucking idiot.  Shut up.  You've been kicked off the show 18 times without ever really being kicked off the show.  What are you doing, blubbering?  Don't you get it?  No, because he's, you know.  Well, that's his problem. 
[01:00:30]  And that plays into it, too.  Stop blubbering.  That plays into it, too.  No, he doesn't fucking understand that.  Stop blubbering.  2011.  Why are there still tards out there?  Jesus.  Do we have the fuck you?  Yeah, we'll play it after the break.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, I want to hear that fuck you.  So we got horse herpes.  A guy can explain horse herpes.  Hopefully, he stays through the break.  Oh, good.  Don't go anywhere.  Horse herpes.  Dr. Drew lost another one.  Jeff Conway.  You can't tease anything anymore with social networking.  Of course.  We'll talk about that. 
[01:01:00]  What else?  You got Wiener's peener picture, sort of.  Sort of.  Another Egyptian, well, an Egyptian businessman accused of sexual assault in a hotel.  Yeah.  That's the second one.  Yep.  We'll talk about that.  Good guy.  Snooki arrested.  Again?  Hangover fucking part two.  Yeah, that was fucking Monday.  Holy shit.  I slipped until.  Oh, oh, I get the movie. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were just talking about.  You were living it, man.  Oh, man.  All right.  We got lots.  And there's a big story in the paper.  We're not going to ignore.  It's a big piece of news today.  We should have mentioned it at the top of the fucking show.  Well, we'll mention it as soon as we get back.  We'll start with that.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  You're listening to O.P.  Anthony.  DMC's birthday. 
[01:02:00]  Good for you, Iraq.  Who cares?  Which one is DMC?  The black one.  Wait, there's Ron.  Oh.  That's Rev, right?  Rev Ron.  Not Revlon.  Rev Ron.  Rev Ron.  Rev Ron.  And then it's the other guy. 
[01:02:30]  Rev Ron.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  47 years old today.  47.  He's an OG.  He's not even that old.  He's been around our entire lives, and he's only 47.  That's weird.  But he's still an OG.  O.J.  P-O-J, yo.  O-J.  The Snooki got in trouble, huh?  The Snookster?  What was she doing now?  You don't watch Jersey Shore at all?  I couldn't fucking care.  There's no way.  Who gives a care? 
[01:03:00]  Last season, there was some good shit going on.  Was there?  I think so, yeah.  Really?  And this year already, you got Ronnie and the Sitch fighting for real, because they never really  fight in the house.  It's all the girls fight, but the guys never fight.  Yeah.  You knew it was going to happen eventually.  And Ronnie looks like a fucking roided out guy, and the situation looks like a guy that  doesn't back down, and finally they went at it, and the situation left the house all  fucked up and had to go to the hospital.  Oh.  So that's going to, we haven't seen that yet, but that's, the story's made in the paper. 
[01:03:30]  And now you got Snooki crashing into an Italian cop car, and the Italians didn't want the  Jersey Shore kids over there.  Well, of course.  Even though they're not kids, by the way, most of them are pushing 30, if not 30 already.  Adults, yes.  MTV kind of threw this at us, like, oh, it's kids just out of college trying to find their  way.  Like, no, most of these guys are pushing 30.  Now, how did she run into a cop car?  I don't know.  Supposedly, she wasn't drunk, but they gave her a breathalyzer, so. 
[01:04:00]  And you get arrested if you run into people over there?  Well, fuck, two of the cops, they put neck braces on, so.  Oh, really?  They said it was a low-speed crash.  Fender bender.  Yeah, even that, though, unless, you know, here in the United States, they don't put  you in jail if you get into an accident.  No, I don't think they put her in jail.  I think they just kind of brought her in.  Brought her in?  Brought her in and checked her out a little bit.  Checked her out, made sure she wasn't drunk.  I believe so, yeah.  It's one of those stories, I read the first couple paragraphs. 
[01:04:30]  Why am I reading about Snooki is what you say to yourself.  Snooki.  Because we have to be up on some of this stuff for the radio show, you know?  There are Jersey fucking shore people out there that listen to us.  Yeah, I guess that's your job, because I can't possibly fucking tune into that for  a second.  I can't even feign interest in those retards.  I know Snooki because, yeah, she's been in the news and things like that, and I know  of the people from Jersey Shore, and I think that's all I need to know.  We've had a bunch in. 
[01:05:00]  I can't, yeah.  Vinny's cool.  I can't.  The situation turned out cool, and JWoww, who I didn't really like, was really nice.  Yeah.  I just can't bring myself to give any bit of a fuck about what they're doing.  Oh, I don't care.  Like, any storyline, I'm just like, I don't, I can't.  Yeah.  It's the oddest thing.  Well, it's page three in the paper today.  That's how important that is for America.  Well, that's how different we are, too, in that respect, because I noticed last night, 
[01:05:30]  it's like, you tweeted that you were watching Jerseylicious.  Yeah, that was a goof.  And that was a goof tweet.  At the same time, I was watching Gettysburg on the History Channel.  Oh, God.  So it's like, okay, I can see where this is going.  I didn't want any knowledge.  I had a long weekend myself, and I just want to relax.  Long weekend.  Nothing to really discuss.  Just a good, solid Memorial Day weekend.  It is nice to be able to have.  I was in the ocean really good days like that.  That fucking ocean is still cold. 
[01:06:00]  I don't care.  It's fucking freezing.  I don't care what the calendar's saying.  Fuck that.  Fuck the northeast waters.  Fuck it.  It's green, and it's cold.  Nah, the ocean, nah, man.  Where do you go?  I don't.  Where do you go?  I go on a boat, and when I look over, it looks green.  We're lucky.  We got some good oceans out there.  Yeah.  Our piece of the ocean out there on Long Island is good.  You know what it is, though?  It's a good color.  Well, it's not blue water.  It's sort of gray. 
[01:06:30]  It's a weird color, the ocean.  It depends where you go.  Because you ever see...  You get some clear ocean, I'm telling you right now.  When the waves are breaking, and you're looking through it, it's like green.  Yeah.  That's like...  Yeah, it's the normal color.  I'm not saying it's from pollution, but it's not...  Jones Beach...  See, down near Jones Beach, you get the gray, muddy-looking water.  Yeah.  Go a little further out east, and then it starts getting into some colors you could hang out with.  But it is greenish.  Like, the Caribbean water is blue.  Oh, right.  I mean, it's dirty, but it's not like the fucking, you know, Turks and Caicos water. 
[01:07:00]  You can only go in water that has that blue...  That's it.  ...that powder blue look to it.  Oh, that's the only fucking water I will go in.  Yeah, but go all the way out east and see what the ocean looks like.  It's pretty nice.  But even in late August, it's fucking freezing.  No, not really.  Oh, God.  I need 90s.  Around Montauk, I'm looking at a picture of Montauk, that water never gets fucking warm.  And it never...  Yeah.  And it's never summer in Montauk. 
[01:07:30]  Uh-uh.  You're always wearing a sweatshirt when you go out there.  It doesn't matter what fucking day it is.  It's always wind.  Water is like putting your feet in ice water.  Yeah.  No joke.  Like, ice water.  It's uncomfortable how cold it is.  And it's always kind of cold out there, man.  Cold-ass fucking water.  Because it blows off the fucking water and just...  The temperatures stay kind of down out there.  I like it.  It's an odd thing.  It's creepier than Caribbean water.  It's like...  Because it's dark and deep. 
[01:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  You can't go...  You go like five feet out on a Long Island beach and the drop-off is into a thousand-foot chasm.  What just happened to my beach?  You can thank Shoreham fucking nuclear power plant for that.  The North Shore beaches got destroyed when they decided to dredge for that thing.  And then you get, you know, the Caribbean.  You're fucking walking out and it's like, hey, great.  And walk in and walk in and walk in.  I can barely see the beach and I'm up to my waist.  Right. 
[01:08:30]  And, yeah, it's nice warm blue water.  Mm-hmm.  See everything.  But you can see the monsters.  Long Island, it's like, all right, these waves are crashing like fucking the end of the world.  You've got to walk over rocks before you can even get to the sandy part in the water.  And then, yeah, it drops off into the Marianas Trench.  But I think you're describing North Shore beaches.  No, that's like South Shore is like that, too.  Long Island, the North Shore beaches, they're very rocky.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A lot of horse crabs and crap.  I know that...  But the South Shore ocean beaches are much different. 
[01:09:00]  There's a lot of sand.  Well, the South Shore beaches are sandy.  But once you go into the water, you could go one day and it'll be like, oh, this is nice.  And then you go another day, the same spot, and you're walking on fucking jagged, rocky lava things.  Oh, that's just medical supplies.  It's always those needles.  They sweep.  Oh, where were we at?  Oh, Jerseylicious.  Yeah, I did watch Jerseylicious.  Jerseylicious.  I did watch them.  That's the Jersey Shore ripoff show?  It's...  Was it us? 
[01:09:30]  The Gatsby.  I, you know, I don't know why.  Were they trying to be...  I don't know why I watched.  Were they trying to do a Jersey Shore thing, though?  Well, it's sort of like...  Yeah, Jersey's hot right now, man.  But supposedly Jerseylicious filmed before Jersey Shore.  And then I think what happened was people...  Do you really want to know this?  Because I did read up on this.  Well, that's just the backstory.  All right.  And then they kind of shelved it.  They almost were like, who's going to watch this shit?  And then Jersey Shore got so big, I think that's when they took it off the shelf.  Like, show that shows how ridiculous Jersey can be, by the way. 
[01:10:00]  Because when I drive around Jersey, I don't see Jersey Shore shit.  And I don't see Jerseylicious shit.  I see pretty much normal fucking people.  I see the turnpike.  Yeah.  And then wherever I'm going.  I don't know where this Jersey Shore, like, phenomenon is happening.  I guess you've got to be younger and you've got to be in the clubs.  Yeah.  I think the one time we got a little hint of it was when we did that appearance at that place right there on the Jersey Shore.  What the fuck?  Oh, and...  Remember that?  Bell... 
[01:10:30]  Was it...  The bar in...  Belmore?  Belmore.  Belmore.  What was it called?  DJs, that's right.  DJs.  We saw a little of that?  Oh, yeah.  I don't remember.  Yeah, there was a lot of shirtless fucking hair gel.  A lot of shit was going on.  That was pre-pre-pre-Jersey Shore.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  So.  Yeah, we don't have to talk about Jerseylicious.  That was a goof tweet that then stupid people go,  Oh, then why'd you tweet it?  Fucking idiots. 
[01:11:00]  I did start another marathon.  I had a dumb Sean Kingston joke, and this guy calls...  Sean Kingston jet-skied into a fucking thing, right?  So I go, Sean Kingston's last tweet, somebody call 911, which is one of his hit fucking songs.  Yeah.  And it got a nice...  People liked the tweet, you know.  And this one guy goes, if he had time to tweet that, wouldn't he just call him? 
[01:11:30]  And the guy was dead serious.  I actually believe that, too.  I don't know the song.  I just read that tweet.  And you thought he actually tweeted?  I didn't make sense to me why he'd have his cell phone in the water, but I did.  I was just playing off one of his hit songs, Somebody Call 911.  I mean, the guy fucking...  Somebody call 911.  One, one.  Yeah.  Somebody fire burning on the dance floor.  Oh, I can hear that.  Sounds nice. 
[01:12:00]  And the person.  And the person.  E-Rock, why are you fading?  Trying to find something.  Yeah, why, E-Rock?  Answer the boss.  Because the clips weren't sounding that loud.  That's why I brought the music down.  Oh, because we weren't playing any.  In person.  Is that better?  Can't find it?  See, it would have been nice if I could have gotten the, you know, the... 
[01:12:30]  All right, fuck it.  Never mind.  I was having some Twitter fun over the weekend with the Casey Anthony thing.  Holy motherfucker.  Dumb as hell.  Just dumb.  And it's all these fucking bitches.  Women are the worst.  Women shouldn't be allowed to Twitter.  Because they have no sense of sarcasm. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, they suck.  A sense of humor.  Any kind of...  Everything is literal.  Everything is literal to them.  So, my whole thing is, we've been watching this Casey Anthony trial.  She's accused of killing her two-year-old back in 2008.  And what's going on is, the prosecution trying to show what a horrid mom she was.  You know, right after this child went missing.  She didn't say she was missing. 
[01:13:30]  She was out partying.  Doing a hard body contest.  And just not acting like a concerned mom of a missing two-year-old.  They wind up, a few months later, finding the kid's skeletal remains in a shallow grave in the woods with duct tape around the skeleton's mouth and shit like that.  Obviously, the kid was murdered.  And obviously, in my eyes, I think this woman did it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Obviously, she was murdered.  But that's...  It could still be an accidental death that she was covering up. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  That's what the defense is going for.  But the body looked like it was murdered.  The body looked like it could have been murder or something.  But, yeah.  Either way, she's guilty as fuck.  Shenanigans.  It depends on how guilty, I guess, is what they're trying to figure out.  Just shenanigans, yeah.  Shenanigans are going on.  Gotcha.  So, I've been tweeting with the hashtag Casey Anthony, because I know all these people that follow that hashtag.  And I've just been saying, please, this Memorial Day, let's remember Casey Anthony is in just the prison. 
[01:14:30]  And in prison, our thoughts go out to her.  And then any woman that was getting all uppity about it, I'd be like, you know, you women are just jealous that her good looks, which just feeds on a few things.  I didn't know you were following the hashtag just to go.  Oh, yeah.  That's funny.  And they were pissed.  One is like, why don't you remember Kaylee, the child, and stuff.  And I would go, it's obvious. 
[01:15:00]  And this one was like, how do you not know I'm kidding at this point?  I said, it was obviously a suicide.  A two-year-old killed itself and wrapped duct tape around its face.  And that got people really pissed.  And every, like, every six, eight hours or so, I would just tweet another thing about Casey Anthony and how innocent she is.  And I start seeing names that I would be familiar at all.  They're women's, all women names, 99% women. 
[01:15:30]  And one was really funny.  She's like, who the hell is this Anthony Comey?  And why does he have 65,000 followers?  They have no clue of the show.  Just nothing.  They probably listen to some morning zoo thing.  And, oh, I love when they do their phony phone call.  And I'm keeping tabs on this Casey Anthony trial.  And they're all the legal experts.  And I am just annoying the shit out of them.  And it couldn't make me happier. 
[01:16:00]  So today, when the trial starts up again, I'm just going to be tweeting total fallacies.  Live tweeting.  Yeah, live tweeting.  I was watching the trial.  Here's my real take on this thing.  I think she does have a chance of getting off the hook.  Which is weird.  Yeah.  I do.  I really think she does.  I've been watching this thing.  Now, again, like NASCAR, I'm no lawyer.  Wouldn't that be cray-cray?  It would be a tad cray-cray. 
[01:16:30]  Anyway, but stranger things have happened.  Here's what I see.  The defense is...  Wait, wait, wait.  Did you eat your whole tub of blueberries, too?  Yeah.  Why?  Kenny gave us enough...  Sorry.  Because I'm looking at Jimmy.  He's doing the exact same thing as me.  I apologize.  We're going to get back to it.  He gives us enough blueberries to feed a whole fucking family.  I ate all mine.  I love Jimmy.  I like them.  Why would you eat them all?  Save some for later.  Now or later.  It's a tub of blueberries that you would have in your fridge for probably four days that 
[01:17:00]  people would just take a handful and put it in your fridge.  Sorry.  I really just fucked you up, but I'll admit it.  But I just thought it was hilarious that you're doing...  Ah, whatever.  Wow.  This is really bad.  Okay.  No, it's...  Your take on Casey Anthony.  I see the defense throwing out a bunch of different scenarios.  She was molested as a child, and that made her cover up her emotions so that when her  daughter did maybe die accidentally and they got rid of her, she was able to cover it up 
[01:17:30]  by just going about her life because that's how she survived while she was being molested  by her father, it was an accidental death, through a bunch of different scenarios.  The father did it.  You know, there's a lot of stuff there.  But then you start thinking...  Are lawyers reprehensible?  Yeah, they are.  They're horrible.  I was about to say that because it's not about...  Horrible. 
[01:18:00]  It's not about innocence anymore.  It's like taking this person and figuring out, okay, what can we use here to get her  off?  Right.  Which you just described perfectly.  And the thing is, but here's the thing, no matter how ridiculous the story is, it has  nothing to do with coming up with a viable scenario.  You come up with as many as you can.  Like, the defense doesn't have to have a story and a timeline, especially with this, because  there's really no DNA in this case.  There's no timeline where she needs an alibi, because there's a weird time of death thing 
[01:18:30]  where, you know, it's a little vague, where she went missing, you know.  So they don't have any of that or need it, because the defense doesn't have to prove anything.  The burden of proof, always on the prosecution.  So the prosecution has to come up with a story that makes the jury go, wow, she did it.  There's been no bombshells here.  They're going, well, she's a horrid mother, yes.  And you know the defense attorney, in closing statements, is going to be, yeah, my client 
[01:19:00]  is a fucking awful mom.  Terrible.  But that doesn't make her a murderer.  What scares me is, you could use that to her advantage, she is such a bad mom that she  wasn't watching the kid properly.  Right.  And that led to someone being able to freaking do what they did.  Accidental death.  But to get her on a capital murder charge like this, with what the prosecution's shown  so far, you know, you want to open big, you want to get the jury, like, fixated on some  kind of, you know, here's what she did, here's a timeline, here's the forensics, and you're 
[01:19:30]  just like, oh my God, this bitch did it.  They don't have any of that.  And...  Circumstantial.  It's a lot of circumstantial, and the defense is throwing so many different distraction  scenarios out at the jury, that the jury's got to be going, I don't know what the fuck  is going on.  So, if they do have a mistrial with this one, I think I kind of see them retrying it as  maybe a manslaughter kind of a case, not a capital murder case, something a little lower 
[01:20:00]  that a jury can go, all right, I can buy that, without it being a premeditated murder, she  wants to get rid of a kid so she can party kind of a thing.  So, I think she might slip this one.  Makes it tougher to find her guilty, right?  And she's a...  Hold on.  White broad.  But knowing the jury has to decide on her life.  Yeah, all they need is one guy to hang out in the jury and go, no, I'm not fucking voting  yes on this.  Gotcha.  And then you get a new trial.  Well, maybe they lower the rap down on her. 
[01:20:30]  Maybe they plea out something for a manslaughter or neglect.  Yeah, or speeding.  Right, right.  A speeding ticket.  Yeah.  But that's what I'm looking at now, because I'll be watching this trial.  I'm all in on this one.  That's reality television to me.  She loses, she dies.  David F. from Kansas City writes, nobody gives a shit about blueberries.  I said that, David.  Oh, shit.  See, I said that.  You stupid fucking parrot. 
[01:21:00]  Fuck!  I went with a blueberry thing that obviously was failing miserably, and I bailed, you idiot.  I told you it wasn't working.  I disagree that it was failing.  You dope.  I disagree.  I think that in the middle of the murdered child thing, people were curious about our  fruit.  Fruit?  Look, it was a long weekend.  We're all a bit tired around the edges.  A little dragging around the edges.  But this stupid dope is telling me no one gives a shit about blueberries.  No, I told you no one gave a shit about blueberries.  I was trying something that failed miserably, you idiot. 
[01:21:30]  How were the blueberries, though, Jimmy?  They were very good.  They're actually, I mean, all kidding aside, they're better than they've been.  They're plumper, and they're juicier.  They're not sour.  Just like a vagina you like.  Plump and juicy.  No, I like it when it stinks a little.  I like plump and juicy, but I want it to have a little stink on it.  A little stink on it?  Yeah.  Like when a girl walks by, I want flies to at least look.  I will interrupt so you can look at what's walking by.  I was wearing a little skirt.  Holy shit.  I like pointing to like the, I like doing this thing where I wave my hand over the door 
[01:22:00]  and point like we're looking at the, because that needs to be taken care of.  All right.  Who comes to work like that?  But she is wearing a booty, she's wearing a booty dress.  And like they say in Philly, she's got some juice.  She's got some juice.  In the ass.  They call it juice.  She is sporting a booty dress, yo.  What an ass on her.  How do you keep it working like that?  How do you keep it working like that?  Booty clap.  Do a booty clap.  She's lovely. 
[01:22:30]  Huh?  She's lovely.  David F. is apologizing.  Yes.  David F. saying, I was typing before you said that, sir.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  That's true.  Oh, what an ass on her, dude.  She must think we talk about the same thing every day, the door jam over the door, because  I'm constantly pointing at it when she walks by, so we can all look in that direction.  And that music from Caddyshack should play every time she walks by, Lacey Underall, that  music they play with their horns when she first walks by or whatever, she's got them. 
[01:23:00]  She's fucking amazing.  What a juicy rump.  Now, Ann, does that confuse you?  Because she's a bit ghetto.  She has a little ghetto in her.  I'm not really into the ghetto look.  I don't think she's full ghetto, but she's got a little ghetto.  No, I think she's got a lot of ghetto in her.  No, she's got a little ghetto, but went to a nice black college somewhere.  Yeah?  Type of ghetto, yeah.  One of those colleges like that the Huxtables go to?  Yeah, a respectable black college.  Not the 13th grade.  No, no, not community college?  No, a respectable black college. 
[01:23:30]  Okay.  We should try to figure out what her profile is and then have her come in here.  She won't come in.  She probably won't let her come in.  Yeah, I don't think she should.  They hate us.  Oh, don't call them that.  Oh, the station.  Yes.  Why do they hate us?  I don't know or care.  Who's the main guy over there?  I don't know or care.  Probably because that time we had Marion Barry come in or whatever.  They're mad about that, but fuck them.  Geez.  How about you mad at Marion Barry?  That never happened.  Yeah.  All right.  Did you see the black biker fest going on down there in South Beach? 
[01:24:00]  Wowie kazowie.  Just what crime, right?  Holy mother of fuck.  Wasn't there a shooting?  Shootings, stabbings, rapes, robberies.  The businesses literally bored up their fucking thing like a hurricane's coming.  South Beach?  Yeah, South Beach.  As in Ocean?  Myrtle Beach.  What is it called?  Ocean Drive or whatever?  I don't know.  It was Myrtle Beach.  I guess there's a South Beach.  Yeah, South Carolina.  Oh, no.  I got the Myrtle Beach story.  Myrtle Beach, yeah.  You just confused me by saying South Beach. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, Myrtle Beach.  Myrtle Beach, they do this.  I was surprised.  South Beach wouldn't allow...  Black Bike Week.  They wouldn't allow Bike Week down there.  They call Myrtle Beach Murder Beach for that time that they were in there.  This, I swear, I thought it was a clip from Grand Theft Auto.  I thought that they had been working on new graphics for GTA, and it looked amazing because  you just hear crashing, gunfire, sirens.  It's hilarious.  Oh, there she goes.  Walking back down the... 
[01:25:00]  Good God.  What a juicy ass.  You can't tell me that it's harassment to look at that through the window.  Not wearing a skirt like that.  She's wearing a short skirt.  She should be wearing fucking dickies if she wants us to not look.  And she's wiggling from side to side.  She knows how to work that ass.  She can walk.  She can walk.  She is confident about her ass.  Women do ruin Twitter.  They're good in skirts, but they destroy Twitter.  Yes.  I was making fun of the Muslim girl who was stoned to death.  Oh, because she came in seventh in a beauty contest. 
[01:25:30]  And of course, some woman's like, you know, I know you're a comedian and all, but you should...  And all.  But you should watch a stoning, and then we'll see.  I have.  I have.  Of course I have.  Great.  Seen worse.  I got yelled at for, because I was saying, Casey Anthony, we ought to keep her in mind  during this Memorial Day weekend and memorialize her and stuff.  And then some guy got all mad.  You know, this is about the soldiers, and it's not a thing to make any kind of fun. 
[01:26:00]  You know, I listen to your show.  If you listen to the show, then take it for what it's worth, fucko.  Realize.  Hey.  I understand Memorial Day.  I fucking take it to heart.  I, you know, I grieve for the war dead, and I watch a lot of great documentaries that  make me feel, like, proud.  And then I make a joke about fucking some woman murdering her kid and throw Memorial  Day in there.  No troops, no nothing.  Just the holiday itself.  And you get all mad at me?  Stop it. 
[01:26:30]  I could complete the trifecta.  People get mad at me because of the Sean Kingston thing.  But Sean Kingston, they go, he crashes into a bridge on his jet ski.  Yeah.  And they love riding their jet skis really fast these days.  I see them going up and down the Hudson River.  It's crazy.  Crazy, crazy.  So he fucking crashes into a bridge, right?  So everyone started a Twitter trend that says, pray for Sean Kingston.  So I write, sorry, I'm not praying for the guy.  I'd rather pray for the people in Joplin because they weren't going willy-nilly on a  jet ski. 
[01:27:00]  And I did use the word or the phrase willy-nilly.  Willy-nilly.  And man, do they come out of the woodwork.  Like, I'm insensitive.  I'm like, first of all, I don't know who Sean Kingston is personally.  And second of all, he did it to himself.  Yeah.  You know, he wasn't like, you know, following the rules of jet skiing when it happened.  No.  It sucks for him, obviously.  And it's a tragedy.  People that were just going about their lives in a fucking tornado took out the entire town.  Yeah, maybe that is a little more important. 
[01:27:30]  It's that whole weird God thing when athletes, you know, go thank God for this.  I want to thank God.  You know?  Yeah.  I want to thank God.  If I was going to pray, it wouldn't be for a guy that was just reckless on a jet ski.  No.  But man, they got fucking pissed.  They called me insensitive.  And then I want to say to them, do you know him?  Yeah.  So if you don't know the person, it doesn't fucking matter in your life.  I like that.  He's in our prayers.  It's like, do you have to write down shit every day of who you want to pray for that night? 
[01:28:00]  Is that what you do before you do prayers?  Well, church people do.  Do they write it down?  It's like, I got to remember this guy in my prayers.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Church people do.  Now I lay me down to sleep.  And then they hand it in to the priest.  Do you want to know what happens?  Really?  The churchgoers.  Yeah.  They write who they want to pray for.  Yeah.  And then they hand in their list.  And then the priest decides which one is to announce in church.  Do they get extra special prayer help? 
[01:28:30]  They edit the fucking list.  They edit the list.  And go, ah, this one's not as bad as this one.  This one's got cancer, but not as bad as this guy's cancer.  It's like, ah, I got bumped.  This guy died, but he was old.  This kid died, and he was overseas.  And they figured out.  And then they read the list, the edited list of prayers that we're all supposed to pray for.  I wonder what the criteria is for editing.  I don't know.  Oh, I would love to talk to a priest that is willing to talk about that.  Here she comes again.  Can we have, like, I don't know, ass-walking music? 
[01:29:00]  Do we have any, like, sultry fucking...  Yeah, dirty old town.  Dirty old town.  You want an ass-walking song?  I know a good ass-walking song.  You do?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She does not even look in here, either.  But that's how you know she knows we're looking.  She knows.  And she's fine with it.  She's fine with it.  When she walks by, though, we should just play, him got a good boy phone, and him not  a boy phone, not a boy phone, and him good boy phone. 
[01:29:30]  I was singing that all week.  Him got him good boy phone, and him not a boy phone.  There's a question there.  Him not a boy phone, and him good boy phone.  It's all in a question now.  It sure is.  I didn't want to do the hardcore reggae one.  Oh, no, that's hardcore.  There's a hardcore reggae one, too.  Which I really don't want to do, because that will get stuck in people's heads when they  hear reggae.  You know.  So, anyway, we got the list of crimes in Myrtle Beach. 
[01:30:00]  Yes.  So, it was Black Bike Week, I guess.  Yeah, they do something called...  It's actually Urban Week, Opie.  Let's not...  Don't pin this on any one race.  Is it all black guys and their bitches?  Yes.  But it's called Urban Weekend.  And the article used the word black.  I was so surprised.  Yes.  The article on Drudge Report used the word black, which is good.  Yeah.  And are the women called old ladies like the white biker gangs?  No, they're hoes.  No, is that the proper...  Shorty?  Is that the proper term for bikers? 
[01:30:30]  I don't know.  Black bikers.  I don't know what black bikers call their chicks.  I'm sure it's not old ladies.  There is a simple word.  All right.  I was trying to get the real knowledge out there, too.  I wonder, because they're not using the same term.  I wonder, too.  That's something I don't know.  And I don't think they go whores, either.  Or hoes.  Excuse me.  Well, here's the list of crimes that happened during...  During Urban Week.  Urban Bike Week.  Yeah.  Right?  Not to be confused with, like, you know, Keith Urban concert. 
[01:31:00]  I think it would be different if it was an urban weekend with Keith Urban.  How desperate...  It's a country.  How desperate is your little city or town that you want to bring, you know, urban bike  week to your town?  Urban bike week.  Well, there was an open letter that one of the citizens wrote to the town, to, you know,  City Hall, saying, how many years are we going to put up with this when no other group,  if they were to come to the city and ravage it with this kind of crime and violence, they 
[01:31:30]  would never be invited back.  But in this politically correct age, this town has to suffer on a yearly basis.  Citizens have to worry about their safety.  Businesses have to worry about their livelihood.  Because you can't just tell these people, you're not allowed to come back here.  Well, who decides this?  The city, because they think...  Yeah, but what guy?  The mayor?  The congressman?  You know what?  Congresswoman?  Who actually decides this? 
[01:32:00]  It would be very interesting to find out who that person is and what their agenda is.  I would love to know.  And this shit happens all the time.  When I was growing up and went down to Spring Break, Fort Lauderdale was the place to be.  I've told some Fort Lauderdale stories over the years.  Yeah.  And it brought in a lot of money to Fort Lauderdale.  Thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands of kids going down, spending money, getting  drunk, whatever, you know, just feeding the economy.  And then, I don't know where they're at today, but I do remember, Fort Lauderdale finally  said, we don't want this shit anymore. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, we don't want you.  So what they did for a good two or three spring breaks, they just beat the shit out of kids,  literally.  Like, getting the word out that we don't want you anymore.  Arresting everybody for the most minor shit.  Because they didn't know how else to stop it.  Yeah.  Because you can't just ban it, but you make it where, look, this isn't fun anymore.  It's just not a fun place to go.  So then the college kids started dispersing and going elsewhere.  I'm sure Fort Lauderdale still has spring breakers, but it wasn't like in the mid-80s 
[01:33:00]  when I went down there.  They were talking about how these festivals, these gatherings and stuff, bring money in  to the city.  Well, that's what you balance out.  Yeah.  But the thing is, and what this person said in his open letter was, yeah, it might bring  money in, but at what cost?  Because for the time they're there, and before that and after that, you're losing out on businesses  or losing out on revenue from people that would come there and shop, because they're not  going near the place.  Conventions, convention halls are empty. 
[01:33:30]  Because no one wants to fucking have a convention during this fucking time where it's rampant  violence, and they know there's going to be violence.  I like the political correctness angle, but I wonder if, believe it or not, this is still  bringing in a lot of money.  I wonder.  I don't know.  Obviously, businesses are-  Not in tips.  Obviously, certain businesses are closing down, and those businesses are suffering, but I wonder  if, overall, it's still bringing enough money where they're just dealing with the bullshit.  I just want to throw that on there. 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  I don't know if it's just totally political.  I think it's PC, because if you say, if a cop was to come out and go, look, there's  more crime when they're here, because then people would go, what about white bikers?  If you were to come out and say, like that state trooper who got fired when Christy Whitman  was the governor, to come out and go, well, there's more crime when this group is here,  you'd be fired for telling the truth.  You'd be fucking fired if you were like a cop and came out and go, look, I'm sorry, but  these black bikers, there's a much higher crime rate.  You'd be fired.  What if every day a group of Irish gathered in Myrtle Beach and just fucking- 
[01:34:30]  Myrtle Beach!  Hi, Myrtle Beach!  I've got a good bi-foon.  Oh, he's got a good bi-foon and a nutty bi-foon.  A nutty bi-foon and a good bi-foon.  I like the Irish one.  What if they were to gather in every year, there was massive violence and stuff, there'd  be more people speaking out.  I think I need to push back on this one a little bit, because didn't they get rid of  Freak Nick in Atlanta? 
[01:35:00]  That was a complete black college thing.  Atlanta's a black town.  It's different.  Yeah, that's true.  It's a black city.  That would be seen as an event removed.  I got some white friends that fucking-  That hide there.  No, it's obviously not all black, but Atlanta's known as a black city.  Absolutely.  That's like New Orleans.  I wonder if it's total political correctness.  I just wonder.  Just look at it.  You know what?  You want to know what the black cities are in this country?  And this isn't even a joke. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not trying to be funny.  I'm not trying to insult people, but it's the truth.  I just recently saw the top 10 crime-ridden cities in the United States are predominantly  black cities.  Detroit.  Yes.  Philly is in there.  Philadelphia.  Philadelphia.  But Philly doesn't look black.  No, it is.  It really doesn't look black.  I'm down there a lot.  You're not going to those areas.  I know there's horrible black areas.  I'm not stupid, but I'm talking when I walk around Old City and Philly in general, the city, 
[01:36:00]  I don't really see-  You know, you're not standing on the line to see the Liberty Bell with a bunch of-  No, I don't do that.  The brothers.  I don't do that.  I don't do that to our shit.  No, I know.  I'm just saying.  I did it once like anyone would.  That area.  I remember when my navigation took me to the wrong place in Philly.  Wow.  Did it ever.  West Philly?  Whoa.  Yeah.  It was bad.  Will Smith's area?  Yeah.  I don't even think Philly's on the list, to tell you the truth, though.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, there it is.  25 most dangerous cities in America. 
[01:36:30]  Philly 17.  Philly's 17.  I got on the list.  Yeah, let's go down the list there.  Springfield, Illinois.  That's where-  All right.  Okay.  This is probably, you know, how far outside Chicago.  D.C.  Well, D.C.  See, now, D.C.  Sorry, but D.C. I consider a black city.  Way before Philly.  It's an obvious black city.  I don't know.  Philly is kind of known as-  It's not what I see.  Oh, okay.  I don't need to defend the-  Hartford, Connecticut.  Wow.  Hartford's bad. 
[01:37:00]  Hartford sucks.  I used to do a gig up there, which I'll never do again, because the fucking- the booker  was a twat, and we have to walk from the hotel to the club, and it would get weird,  and it's the insurance capital, and it's very quiet and creepy at night.  Hartford's creepy.  Hartford is a black city.  I've been there enough to know, wow.  I'm talking about when you just notice it.  Yeah, yeah.  Cleveland.  Cleveland, Ohio.  Black city, yes.  We love Cleveland. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, we-  It's abandoned.  Unfortunately, they like to put us up in shitty hotels in Cleveland.  Springfield, Mass.  Is number 12 in the 25 most dangerous cities in America.  Basketball Hall of Fame.  Huge basketball fan growing up.  Went there.  Really scary fucking place.  Scary place?  Real scary place.  Wow, man.  More than double the- there were 84 forcible rapes per- every 100,000 people, more than  double the national average.  They love rape in Springfield, Mass. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, but do they love raping 85-year-old women?  Yeah, now that guy.  That are out for a stroll.  He's- Buffalo, making the list at number 11.  Yeah, Buffalo's been black.  Buffalo.  That's good, all right.  What else we got there?  Number 10, Stockton, California.  Don't know there.  Yeah, Stockton.  Rockford, Illinois is number nine.  Number eight, Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Baltimore, yeah.  Baltimore has 1,455 violent crimes per 100,000 people. 
[01:38:30]  There were 35 murders per 100,000 people.  Four times the national average.  Little Rock, Arkansas.  There you go.  Number seven, lots of crime going on there.  Number six, Oaktown, Oakland, Biatch, Oakland.  Now, I would consider Oakland quite the black city.  Oaktown, a lot of gang violence going on in Oakland.  Yeah.  Number five, Memphis, Tennessee. 
[01:39:00]  Yep.  Number four is New Haven, Connecticut.  Another one in Connecticut?  Wow.  New Haven, Connecticut.  Connecticut's got two?  Oh, Jesus.  A lot of robberies in Connecticut, apparently.  Two of the top ten?  Coming in at number three.  Number two, Detroit, Michigan.  Why do they have to show that picture?  Because there's so many burnt out houses and buildings in Detroit.  Detroit has one.  You would swear that's Iraq.  Oh, I know.  After the shit that went on over there.  After a shelling. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  Detroit, 1,887 violent crimes per 100,000 persons.  There were 34 murders per 100,000 people, four times the national average.  That's an amazing city, Detroit.  What a...  And number one, Flint, Michigan.  Home of Michael Moore.  Flint had over 28 violent crimes per 100,000 people.  There were 49 murders per 100,000 people.  More than five times the national average, 84 forcible rapes, more than doubling the national average. 
[01:40:00]  What is a non-forceable rape?  Yeah, that's, you know, she's kind of...  She pushed back a little.  She was asking for it?  Yeah.  She was dressed all scantily.  Now, there's a picture that says, God help us save Flint.  Save Flint.  And I know Mr. Moore is all about saving Flint, Michigan, but my thought is this, very simple, after all these years...  Backhoe.  Is it really worth saving anymore?  Because all the people that were smart enough got the fuck out of there.  There was a...  Who would live year after year like that? 
[01:40:30]  A lot of those cities in Michigan had thriving economies back in the automotive days, in the heyday of the American automobile, which is long gone.  There's no way to bring that back.  Like, so, you know, it's like in ancient times where you'd see, like, there was a civilization here.  For some reason, they picked up and moved.  Well...  And then there's just ruins.  That's what you got, ruins.  Yeah, you went to Mexico recently, and you saw that.  That was a, quote, city that just died.  Something happened. 
[01:41:00]  And they moved on to something else.  You gotta move on.  Like, our cities is kind of like...  It's kind of like nature.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Some have to just die.  Some of them are extinct.  You can't prop them up and try to save them.  No.  You know, I've said this a bunch of times, but when shipping was really important in this country, south of Buffalo was really, really important.  On the Erie Canal.  Right.  And you take a ride down, you know, south of Buffalo along the lake, you see nothing but factories and refineries and all this stuff.  It's a ghost town now. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Because guess what?  We moved on to something else.  Figured something else out.  And then another city, you know, got propped up.  Something else was prospering because of the new industry.  If you're ever da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  If you're ever da-da.  On the Erie Canal.  What's the fucking...  I remember that song.  Fuck.  Work 15 miles on the Erie Canal.  If you're ever...  I can't...  Why do I know that?  A music class, maybe.  We've hauled some barges in our day, filled with lumber, coal, and hay. 
[01:42:00]  And we know every inch of the way from Albany to Buffalo.  Low Bridge, everybody down Low Bridge.  We're coming to a town.  And you always know your neighbor.  You always know your pal.  If you ever navigated on the Erie Canal, I think so.  If you've ever navigated on.  Yeah, I knew navigated.  Dude, he just sang the whole song.  You're trying to remember one sentence.  One lyric.  How do you fucking know all the words of that? 
[01:42:30]  Why do you allow him to do that?  Because that's insane.  I don't think I've sang that since I was fucking eight.  How do you fucking remember that shit?  He's an idiot.  It's stuck in my head.  Minus the savant part.  I got rid of that savant part.  You really have this Rain Man quality about your time.  It's very strange.  With babies.  Very strange.  I've got a mule.  Her name is Sal.  15 miles on the Erie Canal Road.  I don't want to pull this barge.  They're ruining my Christmas. 
[01:43:00]  But wouldn't the country be healthier to just let Flint, Michigan die?  Yeah, I think at this point, like, yeah, Flint can't depend on someone coming in and propping up an old industry or getting jobs for the people that are still there.  Because people that are there, for the most part, not well-educated, kind of living off the government.  And I'm not saying everybody, relax. 
[01:43:30]  If you're listening in Flint and you're prosperous, somebody.  We'll never be there.  Yeah.  I'll never go to Flint, Michigan.  Why would I go there?  But it's got to be very difficult to find a job.  What are we supposed to do as a country?  Like, put fake industry in there to try to get jobs going?  No one wants to go to Flint, Michigan.  You can't pump it up.  They've got to figure out something else to do with Flint, Michigan.  Unfortunately for Michael Moore, your hometown's got to die.  Another town or city will prosper, and that's how it works in this country, how it works in the world. 
[01:44:00]  50% black.  It looks to me to be maybe 80% white.  And then maybe 10% other.  What is that?  Black alone, 55%.  No, no, no.  49%.  Oh, 49%.  Right.  White, 42%.  And then Hispanic, three.  Asian, but for the most part, it's split 49%, 42%. 
[01:44:30]  You think there's a Starbucks in Flint, Michigan?  Probably.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Yeah, there's probably a lot.  You wouldn't doubt it.  Yeah, I bet there is with a giant plexiglass fucking thing in front of the cashier,  and you've got to use the lazy Susan roundy round like you're making a fucking deposit.  Just to get your latte?  Yeah, just to get your latte through there.  The type of thing Omar used to buy Newports through?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, that's great that his brains ended up on.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to do the Myrtle Beach story? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, this ties in.  The department is now investigating four violent crimes from over the weekend.  Two people were shot yesterday morning on Ocean Boulevard, but officials say those injuries are not life-threatening.  There have also been three armed robberies within city limits, including a stabbing and a carjacking at gunpoint.  The added amount of crime forced the city to keep all officers on duty this weekend, even constables and probation officers.  Jesus Christ, just behave, please.  Why do you allow that in your city? 
[01:45:30]  Why?  And those are like the ones that were reported.  I mean, people just got punched in the face and, you know, shit like that.  There was one woman.  And she went to the police, said she was raped by a gang of black men.  And while she was telling the cops that, this white guy, I guess her boyfriend, came running out with a shotgun  and went to the gang of guys that she said was raping her. 
[01:46:00]  And they ran off.  Wow.  And then they never came back to finish reporting the rape.  No, who knows what happened down the block.  But one of those clips sounds like GTA.  All you hear is gunfire screaming, cars crashing, and sirens.  It's great.  Let's go to Mike in D.C.  Mikey.  Good morning, boys.  Hello.  So, yeah, about eight years ago, I went down to Myrtle Beach for a bachelor party weekend. 
[01:46:30]  And it was at the tail end of bike week.  And every single place we went into, like Strip Joints, talked about how, you know, they were happy to have the Harley guys here,  but they didn't like the, quote, dark people when they came that week.  Jesus.  The dark people.  We just saw, like, literally everywhere.  They were like, they're dirty.  They have the women with the asses hanging out.  And we were just like, are we back in, like, 1950s Mayberry here?  I saw some video that was amazing of some of these chicks. 
[01:47:00]  First of all, there's a thing going on with the cars where they got these cars that are jacked up real high on giant wheels.  Now, the tires themselves are very thin, but the rims are these funny-looking spoke chrome.  The cars are so high off the ground.  It's not just your basic 57 fucking Chevy jumping up and down with the hydraulics.  There's, like, a whole, yeah, there's a whole fucking thing going on like that. 
[01:47:30]  Like, yeah, that's a prime example.  And they cruise the streets.  I've never seen rims like that.  Every fucking black chick I saw had these little skirts on, and they were all fat, big, fat black women wearing, like, tight, fucking spandex-y shit.  Yeah, that's, like, the look now of the cars that are going around.  That looks so fucking stupid.  Thanks, man. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, it looks so stupid.  It looks like a toy car.  Yeah, look at that one with the red one.  Look at this.  What is, what is that?  Yeah, homie.  How dumb does that look with those tiny tires?  Yeah, yeah, the tires are like rubber bands stretched around the edges of these rims.  Oh, I've never seen that before.  Yeah, I was watching videos of this urban weekend.  Of course you are.  Of course.  I am most educated on the shenanigans of the African Americans and what they're doing with their cars, with their women, with their crimes, 
[01:48:30]  even with the good things in life that they're doing.  Now, I watch Jerseylicious for pleasure.  For pleasure.  Do you watch that stuff for pleasure?  No, because I usually end up yelling and screaming as I'm watching the videos.  Because I get very angry at things that are going on in the community.  I think more energy should be used in, like, look at these cars.  How about you take the energy and money and that and use it to maybe clean up a corner and maybe start a business that isn't a liquor store in the neighborhood. 
[01:49:00]  And then educate the people around you not to bust the windows and rob the place and let the people understand that it's a black-owned business  and that you could come here, spend your money, and we can, you know, start our own economy kind of a thing.  You know.  As a car guy, though, I have to say.  Yeah.  Can you really picture, like, if you have that money to buy that car, if you go, you know what, oh, the heck with it.  I'm going to clean up a car.  It really isn't. 
[01:49:30]  But sacrifices must be made in the name of if you want to be part of a community and you want to be respected and looked at as a viable member of an economy and society,  then you can't be buying your toys yet.  You have to build up.  A lot of those guys have money.  Yeah.  Because your drug deal, like, when they have it, a lot of those guys have money.  A lot of those guys have money. 
[01:50:00]  James in Michigan.  James.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, James.  You know, in Flint, I live in a suburb north of the Point, and Flint's got, like, ten police officers for that whole city.  It's just horrible.  I drive a truck, and they go out there occasionally, and it's terrible.  I go in and get out of that city.  Yeah, you've got to let it just die.  They know where to put their money.  That's good.  And I'm sure the rest of it goes to fucking welfare.  What's Michael Moore's solution? 
[01:50:30]  I don't know what his solution is.  I guess he feels like he has to save Flint, Michigan, but it's not going to happen.  There's nothing left there.  The things that are left are little gas stations, and, you know, there's obviously the major chain stores are there,  but there's such bulletproof there that it's a war zone out there.  Hey, hey, dude, what was that?  What was it?  A mall or a convention center they opened, and they were all proud that it was going to be?  Or a museum.  It was like a car builder's museum.  It was something, and they were all very happy about it, and it wound up closing down. 
[01:51:00]  They were trying to get tourists to come there.  To check this thing out.  And check it out, and no one came.  Who the fuck wants to see that?  Grand opening, grand closing.  Nobody wants to see that.  No one.  It was some of the worst use of money and a waste of time and resources.  How come American cars fell behind like that?  Was it union costs, or was it just the...  What was it?  Unions don't want to hear this, but it's fucking unions. 
[01:51:30]  Unions say it's the companies, and the companies say it's the unions.  Now, if you look at what happened, you got the unions asking for more and more money,  especially during the heyday of the American automotive craze.  You got the unions asking for more and more money, and they never wanted to take cuts or concessions  when things started to maybe drop off because of the fuel crisis and stuff.  And that's when people started buying cars from overseas because they were cheaper,  because the labor's cheaper. 
[01:52:00]  So you can blame people for not wanting to spend more money,  but people don't want to spend more money.  So they're going to start buying cars that are built outside.  And then the American companies started outsourcing because the labor was cheaper.  Why pay some fucking welder or some guy that's doing the painting and shit a fuckload of money  when you could outsource it and not have to pay as much?  And then people like Michael Mork see it as the greedy car companies,  but it's like, you know what? 
[01:52:30]  It's an open market, and I'm going to go where it's cheaper.  Is it greedy consumers because they wouldn't mind paying that money  if people didn't mind spending that much more for a car?  But that's not just greedy companies because consumers want to save money.  It's like everyone's fucking...  But is it greed or is it just human nature?  You're always going to want to buy something for less.  But now instead of, you know, auto workers making half of what they were making in the heyday,  they're making none of what they were making. 
[01:53:00]  And unemployment rampant.  You've got whole cities that were based on these car companies and car manufacturers  just shutting down because the unions didn't want to make concessions and take pay cuts.  Because industries take shits that aren't unionized, you take pay cuts.  And you go, fuck, now I've got to tighten my belt, pull myself up on my bootstraps.  But as far as the unions go, they're like, no, we're not going to do it.  And the people that are talking for the workers, the union organizers, the reps, the big guys, 
[01:53:30]  they're not losing out.  They're still getting their fucking money.  But the union workers wind up out of work.  Yeah, go find another job, fucko.  And everyone, all those guys get fucked.  All right.  We're going to lose a couple of really good phone calls.  Steve in Baltimore.  Steve.  Hey, Ann, I know what kind of car you're talking about.  You're talking about the 94 Capri police car with $4,000 worth of rims on it?  Yeah.  Yes.  Giant. 
[01:54:00]  I'm looking, I'm going to paraphrase on the article.  I have it right here in front of me.  But 19, it's going to be 1999, oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry, that's wrong.  It's 2007.  The AFL CIO of South Carolina sued the Chamber of Commerce of Merle Beach for the businesses  to stay open during Black Bike Week.  And the main reason was is that 80% of the restaurant chains and restaurant industry wanted  to close during that week because of complaints that walked out on checks. 
[01:54:30]  There you go.  You're sure you don't mean the ACLU?  Well, yeah.  He said AFL CIO.  Well, so wait.  So they had to stay open?  Like, their businesses are not being treated properly.  They don't want to serve customers.  You can't tell a business to stay open, can you?  Obviously, you can.  If you're closing because of a racial bias, then they can tell you you can't close for  that reason, I bet.  But what do people want, like... 
[01:55:00]  I'm not sure, but...  If the people down there are going in and they're getting service and they're fucking  being nice in the restaurant and they're buying food, there's no business that wouldn't want  to stay open.  Oh, exactly.  You want to take that money, sure.  Everybody wants to take money, but if you're fucking walking out on checks, it's like it's  the same story from every single person I've ever met who is a waiter or waitress tells  the same story.  If you have to buy a new soda machine because somebody put someone's fucking head through 
[01:55:30]  it in a fight in your place...  Is that more...  What was that?  No, not from what I saw recently.  All right.  Actually, it's a Wikipedia article.  Steve, what do you got on the bathtub?  What's that?  I guess they mixed you up with somebody else.  Some motel owner was really fucking mad because somebody broke their bathtub.  How do you break the bathtub?  Well, some of those asses I've seen.  I don't know what the fuck that's on, but I'm just a sad Oreo lover. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  How do you break a bathtub?  Yeah.  No, how do you break one?  You would need a sledgehammer, wouldn't you?  I'm standing in it doing a booty clap dance.  Oh, my God.  Breaks it in half.  That booty clap thing is fucking disgusting.  Fucking disgusting.  Let me see the booty clap dance.  Because it isn't hot girls doing it, believe me.  In order to get the momentum, to get those cheeks slapping together, like click clacks,  big fat fucking asses, booty clap. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, best booty clap ever.  Did you see the penis one yet?  Have you seen the penis one yet?  What, the penis booty clap?  It was viral for a little bit, but it's a black girl.  Viral penis, Greg.  Oh, there's my girl.  It's black guys.  Yeah.  And they wear loose-fitting, like, boxers or whatever, and then they dance in such a  way that their half fucking hard fucking tics are like fucking...  Oh, God.  You haven't seen this thing yet?  Oh, I think I have. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's hilarious.  She has a nice body.  What's wrong with this?  No, this chick's got a nice body.  This isn't...  But these aren't the ones you see doing it on the street.  Oh, look at her.  That would wreck you.  What is that?  That's a nice ass.  That's like, hey, you know what the booty clap and booty dance is?  Oh, please.  She's fucking got a great ass.  That's a great ass, eh?  I'm not denying it.  Just because she's black.  No, I'm not denying it.  Wow, so they move individual cheeks.  Yeah.  That booty dance, that booty clap thing, it means, could you shove your cock in me? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Come.  Well, yeah.  Get me pregnant and leave.  Well, yeah.  It's a mating dance, for fuck's sake.  Look at it.  What's wrong with you?  Calm down.  No.  That's a hot ass.  That's a great ass.  Look, she's twitching it like an eyebrow.  She's probably a stripper.  One cheek's going, meh.  Ma.  Ma.  I love how she's doing it.  Groucho twat she has.  Hey, Groucho twat.  Ma-da-da-da-da-da.  Ra-da-da-da-da-da-da.  That's the biggest clit I ever saw. 
[01:58:00]  She could move the cheeks individually.  Yeah.  That's a little creepy when a chick can do that.  I wouldn't call that best ever booty clap, but that's a good one.  Well, you know what?  That's a good one.  Who's big ass is this?  And then they got a...  Oh, there's a Bud Light commercial?  Why would it be Bud Light commercial?  Bud Light wants to sponsor the big black ass video?  What's that thing with the label where you just write your name on it?  Someone wrote poo-poo on mine.  How does it work? 
[01:58:30]  I wrote Travis is gay.  But how does it work?  I don't know.  It just kind of scratches.  You take a key and you scratch on it.  Yeah, you take a key, you scratch it in.  Can you just do that on any...  Well, yeah, but it's fun.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  You enjoyed it for two seconds.  No, I didn't.  I didn't even enjoy it for two seconds.  Good.  I haven't fucked a black chicken in years.  Here's the bathtub story.  Mike in Albany.  Mike.  What's up?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  What's that, Mike?  Listen, my cousin, she worked in one of the chain hotels that's right on the beach down 
[01:59:00]  there.  Chain hotel.  Ironic.  Yeah.  And it's like gorillas in the mist in the bathtub.  Oh, Jesus.  Stay good for that.  Why?  Because they were doing the booty shake in the bathtub.  How does this guy know that?  They broke it?  There's a chick doing booty shake in the bathtub.  She worked at the hotel.  She was the manager there.  She says, they come in there, they destroy the place.  They ripped out a toilet one year. 
[01:59:30]  And my friends of mine, they work at a restaurant.  And there'll be 15 of them come in.  And there's just about two bites on their plate.  They'll get up, say it was disgusting, walk out.  And not pay for anything.  And that's why everybody wanted to close up down there.  She said, they'd rather have the white bikers down there because they got more money and  they paid her bills.  There's that going on.  There's this fucking flash mob shit going on where, you know, they just, all of a sudden,  15, 20 black guys and girls will walk into a business establishment and just take shit. 
[02:00:00]  15.  And the store owner isn't going to do shit.  He's standing there like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?  They grab shit.  Wow.  You know, either clothes in a clothing store, food, whatever it is.  And then they'll just, look at this.  Here's a video one.  Is there sound on this?  Oh, it's just the music, yeah.  There's not, you don't need the music.  And they walk in and just take whatever the fuck they want.  Knock shit down.  Look, look, they're just wrecking the joint. 
[02:00:30]  And then they run out.  At least this poor store owner is like, get out of my store.  That's hilarious.  That's like, what?  But they come back and start throwing shit.  Most flash mobs suck.  That's pretty fucking hilarious.  Look, now they're forcing their way back in and now just throwing things at the store owner.  Yelling with their hoodies up over their head.  But that's why as a store owner, you've got to have a, look at throwing garbage in there.  Look, they're just grabbing sports drinks as they're throwing shit.  This guy's like, oh yeah.  He's like, oh yeah. 
[02:01:00]  But they're laughing.  That's at a store owner though where you should be able to take a shotgun and just start blasting at the front door.  Oh yeah, yeah.  And do they look underprivileged?  Look, they're wearing nice clothes and shit.  This isn't a fucking, this isn't a, we can't afford food so I'm getting food for my family.  Don't give me that bullshit.  That's a blatant disregard for the guy's business, for living in a civilized fucking society.  Give me a break.  Let's be honest already.  Where did that video happen?  Any town USA, if you look, they go into a clothing store and just start lifting clothes. 
[02:01:30]  And just walk right the fuck out with them.  Look at them.  Yeah, that's mine.  Gibbs me that.  There's plenty of Gibbs me that going on in that fucking store.  I've had it.  I can't watch this shit anymore.  Don't.  I can't stop.  That ass did put me, the big ass has to put you in a good mood though.  Yeah, that's true.  Jimmy liked the second one.  That's when you lost me, Jimmy.  Comedic moment.  I don't like this.  What's the second one?  There was one you were looking at and you kind of went. 
[02:02:00]  The big fat one I didn't like.  I don't like big fat ones.  I think it was the one in between.  You know what?  Those are chicks in their rooms.  They do it.  But if you just see like a festival on the street and they're doing it, it's always horrible.  Big fat asses.  Look at the white one trying it.  Is there a white chick trying it?  She cut the mark.  Oh, she has a pretty good run.  You know what?  The all up inside that.  That's a good one.  I'd shoot a tray up in that, yo.  Yeah, that's a nice little honey. 
[02:02:30]  Jesus.  She's wearing a little pink.  I don't even know what the fuck that's called.  And listen to what she's listening to and how she's doing that so well.  I know.  Believe me.  You only know what the fuck is happening.  The last thing she wants to do is fuck you and your XM hat.  Exactly.  Yeah.  She'd have her ass up against the window in shade.  Take it away.  Yeah.  That's fucking.  Yeah.  That's a nice ass, though.  That's ridiculously hot.  I love a nice ass.  That's good.  And it's on YouTube, really?  That's like, that's borderline porno, man. 
[02:03:00]  But the second you put something racial up there, they get very upset and pull it down.  Do they?  Violates the terms of you.  Yeah, once the comments start going.  There's another one.  Oh, Jesus.  What's going on there?  There's a chick on a booty clap doing a booty clap, but a messy bed.  She's got a fucking bed.  It's not even made.  Her computer's opened.  Yeah.  She's doing a terrible booty clap.  Let's say hi to Jason in South Carolina.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hi, buddy.  I was going to tell you, well, we've got a friend that owns a bike shop down in Myrtle Beach. 
[02:03:30]  And one week, it's white bike week.  And the next week, it's black bike week.  And they actually have a shirt that say, this week, bike week, next week, buck week.  But the guys, they shut down for their vacation at that bike shop when it's white bike week.  The guys are literally having sex standing up on the side of the street.  They're pissing in convenience stores, grocery stores.  They walk out on their tab.  But we've got some friends that are highway patrol that get assigned to work down there.  And, man, you wouldn't believe the horror stories that they tell down there, man. 
[02:04:00]  It's insane.  And then they turn around and get pissed off when people complain about it.  Local business owners complain about it.  And then they want to start suing because it's racial.  Oh, stop with a racist.  It's not racist.  If fucking any group went into a store and started robbing the motherfucker just because it's called a flash mob and it's on video, it's acceptable.  And it's like, oh, that's okay.  It's innocent.  No, it's not.  They're robbing a store. 
[02:04:30]  And their weapon is intimidation in numbers.  Stop.  Look at that.  What the hell is that?  It's too big for my taste.  Stop it.  It looks fake almost.  It looks full of water.  It does look like it's full of water.  Booty clap.  Don't put your booty clap.  That's a fat black booty shaking.  God.  It's a whole nother fucking world.  It's a whole nother world that I can't comprehend and want no piece of it.  You would enjoy it a lot more than you think.  What?  I'm telling you, it's not as foreign as you think. 
[02:05:00]  Like the crime element, I don't like.  But there's a lot in black people you can enjoy.  I don't know why.  Honestly, I'm not being the house liberal.  It's true.  No, I'm just not savvy enough to the.  But you are.  You're a funny guy.  Yeah, but.  I'm telling you, you're a funny dude.  People like funny dudes.  It's alien to me.  But it's really not.  You're a shit talker.  You're honest and you're a funny guy.  Black people would like you more than you think.  Well, maybe.  Honestly.  Honestly. 
[02:05:30]  You know what I mean?  You would have a much better time than you think.  I don't know.  I don't know the lingo.  I don't either.  Who's fucking whiter than me?  I meet them.  I go, hi, I'm white.  That's what I say.  But you, during stand-up, you've been in front of black crowds.  They hate me.  They hate me.  Do they really?  I hate black crowds.  I like black people on an individual level.  50 of them in a comedy club?  A boo.  Really?  No!  They don't like you, huh?  They hate me!  They like my sex stuff. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, shit.  But they do.  My material.  I've never gotten booed off stage by a black crowd.  And I've never had a horribly aggressive experience.  They just don't enjoy me.  They don't enjoy you?  I don't know why.  Patrice said a burst.  He's like, because you're funny.  He goes, but black people just think they're not supposed to like you.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't like.  And maybe I'm off my game.  But when I've done my sexual stuff, I kill in black clubs.  Or black audiences.  But I do other stuff I don't do as well at all.  Or maybe I just notice when it's bad because they're black. 
[02:06:30]  I don't know.  It's probably half on me, too.  Because you feel the difference.  Oh, maybe you're putting off that vibe like.  I feel like something's different.  I'm not totally comfortable.  Maybe my pace.  My cadence is the same.  Maybe my pace is differently.  Or I don't know.  I haven't done it in so long.  But I think you should.  I think about Ant sometimes.  Like, if there's.  I was watching.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did a special about the Rens.  Who was the.  Before basketball was integrated.  It was a black and a white league, basically. 
[02:07:00]  And it was like.  And then you're like.  It's like you can't be annoyed when you see that.  It's like, God almighty.  Really?  Leaving.  The fucking black players used to carry fucking knives in their socks.  In case they were attacked by the audience for winning.  Oh, shit.  It's like when you're looking at it like that.  You're like, all right.  I kind of get some of it.  But you should do some black things.  I think that would be fucking great to film.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, it would.  Like what?  I don't know.  But I forget when I thought of it.  But there were some black experiences.  Go to the range and turn my gun sideways.  That'd be cute.  No, but I thought of it.  Like, there was some stuff that I think you would enjoy. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  I'm trying to think.  And I can't really come up with any.  You've got to come up with an activity, Jim.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think what activities I enjoy.  Like any.  I don't know.  Too foreign?  Yeah, it's too out there for me.  Sometimes it's too alien.  You should get comfortable with black people.  Should I?  Because I think 70%.  I get as annoyed when I'm watching those flash mob videos.  They're enraging.  And I know that's not the majority even.  See?  I'm not that crazy. 
[02:08:00]  It is enraging.  And as a white guy.  You probably should say that, though.  Because I think people think you think it's a majority.  No, no.  And I do bring it up a lot.  I bet you they would think.  No, no.  I'm not.  But the majority should absolutely speak out more about what's going on.  I think as a country, we should all speak out a little more and not be so coddling and  say, like, what kind of disrespect is there in the black community that this element is  going on?  Not the whole, but just an element of their society is very violent, very entitled to 
[02:08:30]  just go in somewhere and take what they want like that with barely any repercussions, to  tell you the truth.  Oh, the jails are pretty full.  Well, you know what?  With some, you know, pretty hardcore criminals, I think.  And maybe some just guys selling pot, which is stupid.  They might say, you know, let them out.  But I'm not for jailing fucking guys with weed.  No, no.  I'm saying there's repercussions.  Blast go to jail.  But robbery. 
[02:09:00]  I mean, violent crimes, rapes, murders.  If you look, it's way out of proportion as per the population.  It's just way out of proportion.  And that has to be addressed.  It's got to be fucking addressed by everybody.  Not just white people, not just lawmakers.  By everybody has to look and say, this is a national problem we're having.  It takes up resources.  It takes up, like you said, jail space.  You think 50% of the prison population being black helps when that 50% has to be paid for? 
[02:09:30]  How many?  I'm asking.  I don't have an answer for this.  But I guarantee you that of all the black people in jail, how many are middle class?  I'm going to guess almost all are poor.  Yeah, poor.  So, like, is it monetary or is it?  And again, it's just a question.  But where does the poverty come from?  Where does that poverty come from?  How come the town or the people in a certain community can't just take their little piece and make it that much better? 
[02:10:00]  And the people that are fucking slinging dope, they're scumbags.  They're fucking their own people.  Yet, instead of taking responsibility, they'll come up with some wacky idea that the white man brought in the drugs to fuck them up.  The white man has the liquor stores on every corner where they're getting drunk.  You know, it's always the white man's problem instead of just fucking do something about your own little part of your neighborhood.  And again, this is something I don't have an answer for either. 
[02:10:30]  How long does it take?  I was watching the interviews with these basketball players.  This guy, the team is called the Harlem Renaissance.  And there's guys that are still alive that were on that team.  And they remember going to games, not being allowed to stay in the hotel.  You know, they remember all of it.  So, like, those people are still here.  But you'd think it would be worse.  How many years does it take when a country is, when that's the structure of a country, how many years does it take to wash all that out of the system?  To wash it out?  Well, how about when we live in a country now where the black youth look at our country as if they can do anything in it with impunity? 
[02:11:00]  We reach the point where we're so fearful of being called racist.  This country, everyone, being called a racist, it's the new scarlet letter, the R, you don't want to be called a racist, that we're willing to not put a description of a rapist or a murderer on TV.  We'll say, he's early 20s, he was wearing a black shirt, black pants, and police need your help. 
[02:11:30]  How about just say a black male?  I agree.  Could you just fucking say that?  But we're so afraid of being called a racist that we've shied away from saying there's a problem in the black community that videotapes are being made of people robbing people.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  How long does it take for, because at one point it was.  I don't think it has anything to do with the old, old school racism.  It's a new school entitlement. 
[02:12:00]  There's a mentality that goes with it.  Like, the guy was talking about, like, you had to be careful when you're in public.  And he wasn't even complaining, he was just going, you know, you had to be careful, eyes down.  Yeah, I had to.  I'm sure it was terrible.  If you look at a white woman, and that was not that long.  So, like, that mentality, like, the people that are alive today, that's their uncles and their grandfather.  How long does it take before it all gets washed out?  But it's so not that anymore.  But it's the blow, this is the blowback from it.  It's like the country fucked up, people long before us, and we have to fucking pay for it.  But it's like, as a whole, the country should have done the right thing a long time ago, it didn't. 
[02:12:30]  And now this is the blowback.  It goes the other way.  So now you can't even say black in the description, because 60 years ago, somebody would fucking hang you for going, hey, nigger, that's a white woman.  You just look.  Right.  It's like, it was so out of balance in that way.  And now we have a little politically correct imbalance this way, and it's fucking enraging.  But I see it getting worse.  I don't see it.  The more, here it is, the more white America, and by white America I mean everybody else in America, accepts this. 
[02:13:00]  And I'm not talking there should be the truncheons and fucking dogs and fire hoses, believe me.  But the more acceptance that there came and more laws that were made to keep people from violating other people's civil rights and violence towards blacks, the more it got better, the worse minorities got when it came to crimes and murders and rapes and robberies. 
[02:13:30]  Why is that?  I don't know.  Things are getting better.  I don't know.  But it's like the point you raise about just take care of your own community and just do the right thing.  You're right.  But it's almost like for X amount of hundred years, and I'm not saying believe me, I'm not giving the slavery as a cause of it.  Yeah.  But no matter what you do, you don't get what you're supposed to get.  No matter what you do, you just don't get it. 
[02:14:00]  And then after a certain amount of time, people just go, okay, hey, come on, just do it, and you'll get what you're supposed to get.  Like, when does that, the balance comes, it does get washed out.  I'm sure.  But when?  We're just in that part of it where it's swinging the other way.  And it's fucking annoying, but it ain't going to get solved in this.  But that's what it is.  It's like, but when you look at it as a whole fucking picture, it's not like blacks were just handed this fucking, this silver spoon 300 years ago and did nothing with it.  I mean, that's, that's, it's just not the way it worked.  Yeah, but it's obvious things are better than they were. 
[02:14:30]  Sure.  But, but the, the problem seems to be getting worse and we're more fearful to address it is what it is.  And, and I don't know, I don't, like you said, how much time has to go by?  I don't know.  So, but I sure don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.  And that fear, you're right.  The fear is annoying.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm not afraid of being called a racist at all.  I am, I could give a shit.  Yeah, I have no fear of that.  About being called a racist.  I was watching Gettysburg last night and I'm like, God damn, why'd the union have to get Cemetery Ridge?  Shit. 
[02:15:00]  Fuck.  Hey, one more phone call before we go to break.  Adrian in New Orleans, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, we have Essence Festival down here and they actually, the businesses would close there and they were catching all kind of shit for closing their doors because of people not paying bills, not tipping for services.  And hotels, they actually would barbecue in hotel rooms.  You know, not even on a balcony, in the fucking hotel room. 
[02:15:30]  They would barbecue and just try.  In the hotel.  Hey, Brad Delp tried the same thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, he's a white guy.  I have a feeling this is a classic example of maybe that happened once and now it has become they all, they all barbecue in fucking hotel rooms.  There's no way.  It's not for barbecuing, but I mean, you hear it happening every, like I work in the fire law industry. 
[02:16:00]  I serve the fire law panels and every time they leave, I gotta go in and re-put up smoke detectors so they rip them off the ceilings and it's just a mess.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  We learned they barbecue in hotel rooms at the Essence Festival.  There's definitely no secret that there's a...  Let's not get too crazy here, please.  But there's no secret that during these things there's some violence and shenanigans and fucking destruction of property and robberies.  But you ever do spring break?  You never did spring break growing up, right? 
[02:16:30]  No, I didn't.  We went to the, you know, it was a very white thing.  Oh, I've seen a lot of white fist fights and shit like that.  And there's some shit that went on, my brother.  Yeah, yeah.  Destruction of property.  Things like that.  We used to throw 12, 14 guys in one room because we, you know, we had no money.  And was there a lot of gunfire between you guys just, you know, pulling out guns and shooting?  Were you raping, really?  I mean, white people more in date rape.  Yeah.  We're more into date rape than just your blatant I don't know you rape.  Yeah, white people, black people hit you over the head with a stick. 
[02:17:00]  White people drug your beverage.  Yes.  Slip you a Mickey, as it were.  Yeah, and then quietly fuck you in the back of the Chevy while you're vomiting.  And convince you you wanted it.  But Patrice, he has a great point when he said, I've never met a racist.  It's like, it's almost like white people never come out and just go, I'm a racist.  No, no.  So it's easy to go, well, when you look at like, how come black people behave a certain  way?  Well, no white people admit being racist.  Right. 
[02:17:30]  It's like white people don't come out and go, yeah, I'm a racist and he's not.  So go talk to him.  It's like people haven't laid, white people haven't been straight with that stuff either.  So you think it's still prevalent, but, you know, under wraps a little more.  Here's the, blacks cry racism way too much.  Yeah.  And fucking whites don't look at institutionalized racism enough.  That's all it is.  Well, institutionalized racism, yeah, that is, that's rampant.  White people, every time white people hear race now, we're like, shut the fuck up.  It's a, like, every time black guy says racism, we're like, shut your face.  Because, which is not, a lot of times they're right. 
[02:18:00]  And every time a fucking thing happens, a black guy will go, racism, when a lot of times  it's not.  I'm babbling.  I apologize.  I just don't understand why in this day and age you could look at, you could look at black  schools, and I know they're just horrific in a lot of these things, but, and realize  that if you even fucking kind of do well, you're really writing your own ticket as a  black guy to be able to get a scholarship even, and do, it's just, it seems to be, if 
[02:18:30]  you really want to take that road and work hard, that you do have more of an upper hand  than a white guy would at this point.  I'm sure it happens a lot more now than it did 20 years ago.  We're focusing on one thing, but it's not like we have a stat sheet that says in the last  20 years, this is how many blacks have gone from poor to middle class, or this is how  many middle class blacks are now lawyers.  It's like, we don't have that stat in front of us, but it could be a tremendous jump.  I think answers simplify the school system, too, because you see this documentary waiting  for Superman, maybe it's full of shit, I don't know. 
[02:19:00]  Language!  But they talk about the kids that do want to succeed and do well, and then it turns out  that they're nowhere near the same level of other, I hate to say it, white kids in  other school districts.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, they're getting their A's, but it's, the material is not up to par with other  schools, even.  It is a fucking mess.  Well, there's a lot of cities also, and this enrages me when I read about this, a lot of  cities that aren't hiring new police officers and firemen because some group has deemed the 
[02:19:30]  test racist.  And it's like, how is the test racist?  You can either do this, or you can't do this.  See, that's where, and I agree, I disagree.  They said that the thing, like math is universal, but a lot of the other things were culturally  biased, and that's what they...  How is something culturally biased when it comes to a fire or police test?  You know how little you know about certain black experiences? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  That's how little some of them know.  Okay, you're right.  You're right.  About white experiences.  But let me give you this.  If I knew I wanted to get into a certain career, I would fucking learn that shit.  Because that's the criteria for the test.  You don't change the test because the guy doesn't know how to do the test.  You make the guy learn how to pass the fucking test.  I didn't go to school and know every test.  They didn't give me the test.  I had to learn and then study for it and take the test. 
[02:20:30]  Well, it depends on what the...  I don't have any cultural examples as to what they had to change or what was deemed by us.  I doubt there's questions about Muffy and Caviar on these things.  No, no, no.  I bet it's pretty universal.  I don't know why they were deemed that, to be honest with you.  Maybe it was just an excuse because of the lower test scores.  I mean, I don't know.  I think it is an excuse.  I think it is an excuse for the lower test scores.  I just don't know the answer.  I think I agree with Ann on this one.  Yeah, it's just a... 
[02:21:00]  Learn the fucking thing.  If it's culturally biased, sorry.  Some tests are harder for certain people than others based on a lot of things, not just race.  I mean, but you had to study for the test.  You didn't do it the other way around.  We didn't make the test easier for you because you couldn't do it.  You had to study harder.  And some people, sorry, you're just stupid.  You're not going to fucking pass the test.  Everyone didn't get an A when I went to school.  They got an A, someone got an F, and everybody else got shit in between. 
[02:21:30]  But you didn't change the test because someone got a fucking F.  So then what...  But then you take it one step further.  Uh-huh.  Then you have all, again, white cops in black neighborhoods.  The white cops are nervous and uncomfortable because most of them are suburban guys.  Sure.  The fucking blacks resent them.  So it's like, how do you fix that?  How do you...  And I'm not saying white...  Don't hire white...  I'm saying how do you balance that a little bit?  It's almost like a chicken and egg thing.  Right.  So what is it?  Is it the cops, the suburban cops, sick of the fucking crime? 
[02:22:00]  Or is it the fucking black guy treating the cops with no respect because they're not getting  treated with respect?  Well, the truth of the matter is, sorry, and it sucks, but the cop is the authoritarian in  any given situation.  And if whoever gets pulled over, whatever the fuck color you are, you have to treat him  with respect.  And it's something that even Edward Norton said in America, allow the police a certain  latitude because they're doing a job that none of us want to fucking do. 
[02:22:30]  Absolutely.  So we give them a certain amount of latitude, not to tune somebody up in the middle of the  fucking street, but to say, hey, you, what the fuck are you doing in this neighborhood?  That's a viable fucking question.  If you ask me, I agree.  And if there's five fucking black guys riding around a weird neighborhood and a fucking  car, uh, uh, you might take a closer look than you would a white guy driving in suburbia  in his BMW going home. 
[02:23:00]  Why?  Because statistics show that the one car might be car isn't doing, but our experience with  cops and I know black cops in the ghetto are probably worse on fucking people than white  cops in the ghetto.  They're fucking brutal on, on other black people.  It's, I don't think that if it's all black cops, everything's going to be terrific because  they're, they're fucking hated by a lot of people too.  Yeah.  But I think our experience with cops is different.  But how about a black guy that is in a car with a bunch of his buddies, right?  And they're driving around, they get pulled over and have no drugs on them, all their paper 
[02:23:30]  are in order.  And they could just go to the cop and go, yes, officer, you know, satisfying it would  be to be able to go, I got all my shit.  My taillights fucking work.  You pulled me over for no reason, but not even say it.  Just be like, yeah, I got my shit.  And they go, thank you, sir.  And you drive off.  And the cop's like, now the cop is thinking, wow, look at that.  I was totally expecting to find dope or get some fucking attitude from them or something. 
[02:24:00]  How about we start somewhere like that?  You, you treat the authoritarian figure with respect, bite your fucking tongue, give all  the shit you're supposed to have, and then drive away.  I do.  I agree.  But my, but my, every black guy I know tells, this is where like everybody says like, you  know, in the restaurants, they don't tip as well.  So I kind of believe it.  Every black guy I know tells me the same experience.  Not that cops are always bad to them, but there's something when you get pulled over, there's 
[02:24:30]  this weird adversarial thing that happens.  And I don't understand it because it doesn't happen to me.  I don't feel it.  I think it's because of what the cops see on a daily fucking basis.  Okay.  And the black guy's argument would be, well, this is the way we get treated on a daily  basis.  Like you're saying, just be polite.  And I agree with you.  And they say, yeah, but that's easy for you to say, cause you don't get pulled over.  Or two or three times or five times more when you're not doing anything wrong, then you  start to get annoyed.  Well, if the culture of crime and violence would stop, then in time, perhaps they wouldn't 
[02:25:00]  get pulled over five or 10 times.  But there's a, there's a culture of violence and crime and a complete lack of respect for  the law that, that goes on.  Yet the first people on calling 911 and want the cops there when the guns start firing, uh,  as the people in black community go, we don't have enough police in the area.  And then they show up and they get shit thrown at them.  I know.  I don't, again, I agree.  But their, their argument would be if, if the police were nice to us when they pulled  us over, we would, I'm just telling you, that's what, well, start it. 
[02:25:30]  Well, I think it's got to start somewhere.  Start with having your proper shit, not having dope in your car and fucking abiding by the  laws.  Maybe then when a few cops, uh, uh, after a while are pulling people over and realize  nothing's going on, maybe then they won't pull over as much, but when they pull over  a lot and, and statistically they're pulling drugs out of the car, getting a guy with warrants,  maybe finding a gun, maybe then when they pull you over, that's why they're not being 
[02:26:00]  nice, you know?  Um, yeah, I, I agree.  And I disagree a little bit, but I, I agree.  I see your point.  I do, but it's got to start somewhere.  And that's why I said chicken or egg.  It's like, who's got to change first.  The cops, by the way, have to go through so much sensitivity training now and, and they,  they get, they get crucified for doing anything that's deemed racist or violent.  Their emotions are not supposed to come into play when they work.  Meanwhile, they're taking their life into their hands in a lot of situations.  And they have changed the culture of the police department. 
[02:26:30]  Not totally.  Believe me, there's still plenty of thugs in there, but they've changed the culture where  they want to try to respect the communities more and stuff.  But the black community has, seems to have only gotten more kind of fuck you to the police.  See, and my instinct is just to agree with you and cause I'm pretty pro cop is just go  fuck them.  Like, yeah, I know, I know, but it couldn't be a hundred percent one way in any of it.  It just can't be.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I know.  And there's two, there's a couple of cases. 
[02:27:00]  There's a SWAT team.  I think it was in Arizona that burst into some guy's house, an ex-soldier, and just shot  the shit out of this guy for no fucking reason.  That, I don't know why that happens.  And then another guy works in a pharmacy.  And I'm getting a lot of this because a lot of people like NRA do to say in this.  Well, there were a couple of robbers ran into a pharmacy, both of them armed, pharmacist,  licensed carry, pulls out his gun, shoots one of the guys, chases the other guy out  the door trying to shoot him, comes back.  The first guy now is laying on the ground. 
[02:27:30]  He is not, no longer a fucking threat.  It's all on video.  It's all on fucking camera.  Laying there, no longer on threat.  This motherfucker, a pharmacist, actually turns his back on the guy, kind of proving  that he wouldn't think he's a threat.  He wouldn't turn his back on the guy.  Walks up to him, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, just starts firing shots into the guy.  I'm not going to defend the pharmacist on that account.  I love the fact that he initially shot the guy.  I love the fact that he chased the other guy out there.  But then you get on the phone, call the cops, and have them deal with it. 
[02:28:00]  You can't then become the executioner and fucking kill the guy as he's laying there.  The threat situation changes by the split second when you're in any kind of gun confrontation.  And you have to take that into consideration, or you're going to end up in prison.  And I'm not going to defend this pharmacist because he went way over the line on that.  And, you know, because people were asking me to react to that one.  But it's another deal where it's like, I'm not on the side of the guy that's just, hey,  I'm the guy that's going to fucking take care of crime here. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, that guy wasn't reacting properly.  And it will change.  It will change.  I think when no one is alive who remembers any of this stuff, that will be a huge step in it.  But again, after watching that documentary, and it's like so many you've seen, there's no way  the country goes from being the way it was for hundreds of years.  And then just to that in the 1930s, 40s, 50s, to all of a sudden, 50 years later, boy, blacks  are given anything and they're just these entitled animals.  It's like, no, it couldn't be that cut. 
[02:29:00]  That's just, it doesn't make sense.  But white culture has changed.  White culture has changed.  Yet, black culture from the 50s till now, we were looking at a lot of nonviolent protests  with Martin Luther King.  And now, white culture has changed over that short period of time in how they're treating  the black community.  Even though Malcolm X was right above Martin Luther King.  Right, right.  And I think Martin Luther King would have got more stuff done. 
[02:29:30]  But Malcolm X's attitude of, fuck you.  He was right.  I mean, look at how you feel about radical Islam or whatever.  Can you imagine if somebody said, look, the Muslims are here.  Just be nice.  And they were continually.  Just be nice.  But you would, and just like, whatever Muslim guys.  You'd say, fuck you.  Yeah.  You'd go, fuck you.  And that's just a small group.  Imagine if it was the majority.  But white culture has changed as far as its perception of black people, as far as its acceptance.  And by acceptance, I don't mean, look, oh, wow, aren't we amazing? 
[02:30:00]  We accepted them.  No, that's what should have happened.  And it did.  It did happen to the point where, like I say, we have a half black president, but close enough.  But but black culture seems to have gotten went more the other way because they're allowed to now with without the thought of.  Yeah, there's prison, obviously, yes.  But there aren't lynchings.  Right.  On a massive scale.  There aren't beatings because you're walking down the street with a white girl on that huge scale. 
[02:30:30]  I'm talking about.  You're still going to get instances.  So when does that balance out?  Let's say that you're dating a girl and you're pretty good to her.  Yeah.  And she's fucking other guys the whole time.  Right.  And then she stops.  And she goes, see, I'm not fucking other guys anymore.  And then every time you think about it, go, you fucking cunt.  She's like, what do you mean?  I stopped.  Like she gets mad at you.  It was more having a residual resentment or annoyance. 
[02:31:00]  I like your analogy.  That she was fucking other guys.  And her attitude is, hey, I'm being good now.  And you're like, you fucking twat.  You should have been good the whole time.  No, I like your analogy, but that's not how it happened.  I'll use your same analogy with the way it did happen.  You guys are together.  You're 16 years old.  You like this chick.  And she's fucking other guys.  And you're like, you know, God, but I like it, whatever.  And then as she grows a little older over the course of many years, you two remain together. 
[02:31:30]  Maybe you broke up.  You got together again.  And then by the time she reaches 30, she's not fucking other guys anymore.  She gradually realized I'm maturing.  This old life that I had was kind of youthful.  And, you know, I was kind of crazy.  You stuck with me.  And now I'm not fucking anyone.  It's not a massive, I stopped fucking everybody.  But the innocence of growing up and turning 30 and just realizing your youthful mistakes doesn't go.  If we're going to use the two as a comparison, the vindictiveness of what was happening here for so long. 
[02:32:00]  You're still going to resent.  Oh, of course.  It wasn't an innocent thing.  Like, eh, white people just happen to do better on their test scores.  Even Steven, eh, you know.  Wait, who's the one getting fucked?  Blacks or whites?  Who's doing the fucking?  Wait a minute.  To me, for the comparison between race and the relationship, the relationship chick, she has to be fucking other people.  And then just annoyed that you still think about it after she has decided to stop.  Okay.  And eventually you do have to move on, though.  And then you've got to lick her pussy clean.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're in a shitty relationship like that, you also have to eventually fucking move on. 
[02:32:30]  Let's clean the pussy.  Like a cuckold.  You have to lick it.  All this comes back to that.  Why don't we take a break here?  We've got a retired NYPD.  We've got a firefighter on the line.  If they could stay through the break, that would be wonderful.  Yeah.  And we could continue with this.  We've got to talk about Jim Norton.  He's in the paper today.  Yes.  For racist behavior.  That's right.  I was egging black people in my building.  I thought you were the guy on the Upper East Side.  No, that wasn't you.  Oh, the A with the old broad.  We'll talk about that after the break.  Because that's going to be a whole other discussion. 
[02:33:00]  If that's okay.  Speaking of Norton, Drew Boogie just handed this in.  Oh.  Yes.  That's a good boy's phone.  That's his nutty boy's phone.  I'm nutty boy's phone.  And he's good boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone.  That's his nutty boy's phone.  I'm nutty boy's phone.  And his nutty boy's phone.  I'm nutty boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone and it's not the boy's phone 
[02:33:30]  It's a good boy's phone and it's not the boy's phone  It's a good boy's phone and it's not the boy's phone 
[02:34:00]  It's a good boy's phone and it's not the boy's phone  It's a good boy's phone and it's not the boy's phone  It's a good boy's phone and it's not the boy's phone 
[02:34:30]  Thank you. 
[02:35:00]  Thank you. 
[02:35:30]  This is my favorite show in the history of the fucking universe.  Now are we back?  We were just talking on the air, weren't we?  Did I go over the air?  No, we started talking.  The promos.  Tackin' tackin'.  Sometimes it takes forever to get back to the fucking show. 
[02:36:00]  There's a lot of, like, what, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  No, no, as Anthony walked back in, as we were listening to that song.  We got a guy that wants to talk to you, by the way, 53-year-old black man.  Oh, am I going to get yelled at?  No.  I want Anthony to do some black things.  We're not even going to do black things.  We should get some hardcore black guys in here.  Oh, no, we did that bit once.  Did we?  Not with Ant, though. 
[02:36:30]  No, no, just to talk.  Remember Spaz, who was openly racist, and then we brought in some hardcore black guys?  That's how we met, well, hardcore and Chuck Nice.  That's how we met Chuck Nice.  He came in for that bit.  Oh, God, that's right, yeah.  And it was basically, we were doing a scared straight with this guy Spaz.  Yeah, right, right, right.  And he didn't say shit for these guys.  No, he didn't say anything.  But Ant's not a racist, though.  He was a moron.  Ant sounds like a racist, but he's really not.  I honestly don't think that Anthony's a racist.  I'm not actually that much of a...  I'm a thinking man's racist. 
[02:37:00]  Let's say hi to Rodney in South Carolina, 53-year-old black guy.  Hey, we also got the retired NYPD and the firefighter, and we're still not talking about Jimmy.  He's in the fucking paper today.  Yeah, that's right.  It was a whole racial incident.  It was like I told someone to move out.  No, they just profiled my apartment.  Yes, sir.  Well, no, we want to talk more about it than just that.  Oh, I know.  But it's in the Post today, if you want to pick up the New York Post.  Big feature on Jim Norton and his apartment, but we'll get into it in a little bit. 
[02:37:30]  But first, it's Rodney in North Carolina.  Rodney.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, Rodney.  What's up, Rodney?  Rodney, the great Rodney Allen Rippey.  You might remember him from the old...  Oh, he got more jokes.  All right, Rodney, what's up, man?  He got more jokes.  Listen, Anthony, I like your show.  I've been listening to it ever since you guys been on XM.  Thank you, sir.  I really like your show, and I really get a kick out of it.  But today, you got a got me.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because I noticed that you use the words statistical numbers all the time. 
[02:38:00]  You're always saying that statistically blacks are doing this and doing that, but you don't  use real numbers, because there are more whites that are on welfare, in prison, than  there are blacks.  Numbers, real numbers.  Well, yeah, real numbers, but you got to...  They commit all kinds of crimes.  But you got to look at the population percentages.  You can't just...  That's why you can play those numbers with them.  No, it's not...  That's a smaller part of the population.  Dude, it's not playing the numbers.  When you have a 10% population doing 50% of something, that's a problem. 
[02:38:30]  That's a statistic.  But if you have 10% of the population that's 100 people, when the other 90% are 900 people,  and they're...  I mean, come on.  You're playing games with the numbers.  You're playing games with the numbers.  No, when...  How do you...  I agree with you that there are problems in the black community.  Believe me, I believe you.  Yeah.  I try to raise my children to do the right things in life. 
[02:39:00]  Well, that's good.  You can't just blow off percentages.  Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let them finish.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  But anyway, I noticed that Opie had said something to you about the...  I don't even know the name of the Jersey Shore.  Oh, Jersey...  Jerseylicious, whatever.  ...Italians.  Yeah.  But you didn't take responsibility for what they do, so why should I take responsibility  for every black man?  That's right.  And I'm not saying that you should. 
[02:39:30]  What I'm saying is that there's got to be a little more...  And here lies the difference.  The black community seems to be very, at least on the outside, close-knit.  Very, we got to be together with this.  We're just using the word community a lot, the black community.  But it seems to end where the real community help starts.  You know what I mean?  You want to be this one big kind of the black community, the society of the black people. 
[02:40:00]  But you don't...  We really don't have much of a choice in that, do we?  Yeah, I mean, we've been renegaded to that because of the way white society treated us  not that long ago.  I remember when I was a young boy, my grandmother going to the grocery store with my grandmother,  she wasn't allowed to shop.  I am not arguing the horrific conditions, Rodney.  I'm not arguing the horrific conditions that black people had to grow up in years ago. 
[02:40:30]  What I'm arguing is that things have changed, yet you're looking at young black men acting  out more than ever.  Yeah, I agree.  Now, I agree with the way that because of being raised and a lot of kids, and that's not all  black, but...  No, no, I'm not saying all.  ...family homes.  A lot of black males didn't probably get the kind of nurturing or fatherly advice that 
[02:41:00]  they would if they grew up with their fathers.  Well, that's true, but I grew up with my mom, and the only time I spent with my dad was he  was a horrible father.  And, you know, but you got to, as a person, know right from wrong is what I'm saying.  But look at what a mess you turned into.  Yes.  You fucking drunk drove, you fucking knocked air conditioners, you just happened to sound  like Reagan.  Sorry, Rodney.  Lucky me.  You could be good in radio, and you've got a wonderful break, and you're a rich man now, 
[02:41:30]  but, I mean, you're not the lord of the manor.  But I...  Wait, Rodney.  The lord of the manor.  Are you saying that...  You drive drunk, and you drive fast.  I mean, you do all the stereotypical things that you hear about Italians doing.  That is true.  He's got you there.  What's this moolie talking about?  Can I ask Rodney a question?  You've listened long enough.  I got to know.  You're 53 years old.  Do you think Ant's a racist?  I don't think he's a racist.  I think that's the way he was brought up, because I heard on the show about him. 
[02:42:00]  I know some of this is just for the show, but, you know, the things about being nigga  rich and all this kind of stuff.  I mean, I've heard...  I think he has his...  I think he's slant.  I think Jimmy's right.  I think he needs to come and really see what the black community is all about.  You know, you guys had talked about earlier.  You talked about the Essence Festival in Louisiana.  If they didn't...  If the Essence Festival...  The Essence Festival has been there a while.  If Louisiana didn't want them there, plus Louisiana was, before Katrina, mostly black  anyway. 
[02:42:30]  If they didn't want them there, they wouldn't be there.  But I know that they have the CIAA in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they want them there.  But I defended the Essence Festival.  I made it clear that it's not every black guy barbecuing in the hotel rooms.  Barbecuing in the hotel rooms.  That was just ridiculous.  Come on.  Huh?  I've been a black guy in my life.  I've never heard of that.  Ah, yeah.  Now, I don't...  I've been to the Myrtle Beach bike.  It's wild in some places, but it ain't like the shootout at the O.K. Corral.  It's not every black man down there with a gun going down there holding up places. 
[02:43:00]  I mean, you're going to have some bad apples.  You're going to have some bad apples in the white community, too.  So, I mean, I've heard of bikers tearing up hotels and going in and doing everything they want to do.  Yeah, I'm not...  That's why I never use the term every or all or things like that.  I understand.  I talk...  And it's what you brought up when you first called.  It's a disproportionate number.  And you can't just blow off the percentages, sir.  You can't just say, what about real numbers when you're talking about statistics? 
[02:43:30]  That is, in essence, what statistics are.  You can't just say, well, only two black guys committed robbery, yet five white guys committed robbery.  Well, when you're talking that the percentage-wise of actual black people are very low compared to the white people,  statistically, blacks are committing more crimes than whites, is what I'm saying.  Is it because they're black or is it because they're poor? 
[02:44:00]  Because don't blacks make up statistically, using your numbers, more below the poverty level?  Yes, and again, one question is, why is that?  The second thing I have to say is, yes, but I don't just see it as being a poverty being the problem.  There seems to be, and again, not all, but in especially young black men, there's this inherent, like, just a need to switch too quickly to violent behavior in some type of confrontation. 
[02:44:30]  It's what I've seen happen, and again, not everybody, but there's this very aggressive nature in wanting to just turn an ordinary argument  and escalate it into something of violence based on, a lot of times, nothing, lack of respect, somebody maybe giving you a bad look,  someone online at a fast food place not serving the food properly, all right?  It just goes from this insane, really not a big issue, to punching in the face. 
[02:45:00]  I'm not talking gunfire.  I'm talking, like, fighting and just too aggressiveness.  Too much aggressiveness.  I could say the same thing about these little white kids in Columbine who, because somebody picked on them.  Well, you could bring up Columbine, but look, look how far back you've got to fucking go, again, to find the time that white kids go crazy.  Yeah, Columbine was the one that came to mind, but I don't have to go back there, so I just can't remember the name of them. 
[02:45:30]  No, no, we know.  Look, I'm never going to deny the fact that white people crimes do consist of school shootings and whatnot, things like that.  The errant, loony white guy that wants to shoot a politician, shit like that.  I understand that.  What I'm talking about is a steady stream of violence and a culture that embraces and glorifies violent behavior in music, in film, 
[02:46:00]  in just walking around with this attitude because they know that it produces a fear, a fear of violence.  Where does that come from?  The thing about the culture you talk about in music and that preaches violence, the reason why that's in the society is because it makes money.  All right.  Why is it so accepted? 
[02:46:30]  Not only to little black kids, but also to a whole lot of white kids.  Oh, the little Wiggers love it.  The little Wigger kids love them.  But wait, is that also, it's also...  It wouldn't be such a large industry if it was just in the black community.  No, I get you.  I understand.  It is mainstream at this point.  I understand, and I don't mind it.  Believe me, I would like, I have no problem with any music that anybody writes.  I think people should be free to write whatever fuck music they want.  But there's not just the music.  It's not just a band trying...  Like, look at Marilyn Manson.  Do you think he popped that fucking eyeball to contact in and put his makeup on and went to the store like that and actually lived that lifestyle? 
[02:47:00]  No.  But a lot of these hip-hop guys, they're carrying illegal weapons.  They're fucking pants around their ass, and they're living that lifestyle.  But it's also, it's rebellion.  It's all, Ron, what's ever seen as rebellious.  Like, for a long time, rock and roll was rebellious.  It was more innocent than rap is as far as content, because you couldn't get away with stuff in the 50s that you can get away with now. 
[02:47:30]  But it was seen as rebellious.  And now, then rock stars became fucking pussies and became preachy and boring, and rappers were seen as at least being honest about their own experience.  And that's why fucking rap caught on, because rock guys became such fucking cornballs.  That's why white kids couldn't enjoy it anymore, because it wasn't rebellious anymore.  Rodney?  Yes.  Comment?  Comment, Rodney?  Well, the thing that I have to say, and you made a comment earlier about why that, as far as the statistical, why blacks are below the poverty line. 
[02:48:00]  And I just think about, I just think about the ways, and Jimmy said it earlier, about the opportunities.  It's not a societal racism, outward racism.  It's pretty much inward.  And it's not blatantly, they're not going to just call you a nigger, and they're not going to just, I mean, but it's still, no, I'm not going to hire this guy.  I already got a black guy in. 
[02:48:30]  You know, I'm not going to hire this.  And you say something about, and I've heard other shows with you, it's something about affirmative action and some other things like that.  And, you know, these things were put in place because whites wouldn't give the opportunities.  And since you own this company, I mean, this country, what are you going to do?  But whites don't own the country.  There isn't this, there's just a lack, a lack of people that are just qualified. 
[02:49:00]  If a black man goes to school, goes to college, comes out of college as a qualified man for whatever job he went for,  he's got a much better chance of getting a job than a white guy does of equal qualification.  He has a much better chance.  You are correct.  He does.  But you know what it takes to get to that point?  It's not on an equal level because no matter, it's just like you had a character there on your show called Tippi Tom. 
[02:49:30]  If Tippi Tom was to clean up and go in someplace and I'll sit down inside of you, put a suit on Tippi Tom and try to get him to act civil,  they would talk to Tippi Tom or they would pick up Tippi Tom or try to give him a job before they give him.  I don't know about that.  What are the qualifications?  What does the resume say?  There's no easy fucking way is what I'm saying.  It's like you either got to work your balls off your whole life or you got to work your balls off.  You got to work your way up from maybe flipping burgers, which is like, I won't flip no burgers, motherfucker.  How about you flip some fucking burgers, make some money and then move on in a progression 
[02:50:00]  so you're not thinking you're going to be the president of IBM when you fucking drop out of high school.  Because there's nothing wrong with flipping burgers because flipping burgers is an honest job.  I have no problem with that.  And I tell my children that you take any opportunity that comes and you build on that.  But the thing of it is, if I'm a college graduate and I have a master's degree and another guy,  you're going to look at it just the way it is. 
[02:50:30]  You have never been a black man.  I've never been an Italian.  So I can't tell you.  Well, you're close enough, Rodney.  Believe me.  The Moors.  Hey, you know what?  We need two things in here.  One thing I would like, first of all, we need to get Farrakhan booked on this program.  Oh, that would be fun.  I saw Farrakhan give, who was it on 60 Minutes, Mike Wallace?  Did he give him a talking to?  He gave Mike Wallace a fucking thrashing.  What did he say to him?  Oh, Mike Wallace was talking about, and Farrakhan's such a good talker that even if you make a point, 
[02:51:00]  you're not going to out-talk that to him.  It's just one of those deals.  It was something about Nigeria or one of those countries being so corrupted.  Having a silly name that we always make fun of?  And fucking, oh, and old Louie.  He got annoyed.  He very, very rarely raises his voice.  He gave, I think it was Mike Wallace, a pummeling about how dare you put yourself in a position of moral superiority over anyone. 
[02:51:30]  He gave him a Sweeney Farrakhan in here.  And I also, I think we should do something where Ant, and I would go, I don't, because I don't hang out in the ghetto.  I don't want to come off like I think I'm fucking, I'm fucking, you know, you know, I have a fucking hood pass.  But we should go do something that is very, very black.  We should go into a very black place in Harlem.  Let's go to Harlem and get some chicken.  Anything.  Just have somebody bring us. 
[02:52:00]  What's that fucking soulful place up there?  Sylvia, but that doesn't count.  Sylvia, that's a tourist trap.  That's a safe place.  A bunch of white people are there.  We got to get some fucking Harlem chicken, man.  We'll just go to a soulful place.  Something that we can make it a little fun.  Out of our comfort zone.  Soulful.  And look who's talking.  Remember when we had to do that photo shoot up in Harlem?  I was scared.  I'm not going to throw it.  You were also the guy that was going, holy shit, get us the fuck out of here before the sun goes down.  The reason why I'm pretty quiet, I don't have a passion for this like Ant does.  Simple as that.  But when we did this photo shoot way uptown in Harlem, yeah, I was scared of my fucking mind. 
[02:52:30]  But that was out of my comfort zone.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's what I'm saying.  It's out of mine.  I live among more black people than Anthony does, but it's safe.  It's a very safe zone I'm in.  I realize when I'm out of my fucking safety zone.  And that day I was out of my safety zone.  Me too.  Yeah, I know that feeling.  But I walk around the city among black people.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  I walk around.  I know where not to go.  Not as much, Ant. 
[02:53:00]  Wait, I go.  You're in your car and you're back to an extremely safe white neighborhood.  We need to get you.  And you're not in the city enough.  I want to say one thing about Anthony's neighborhood, if I may.  Yes, sir.  Jews!  Oh, if you want to talk, then I'm all in.  I'll talk until the fucking cows come home, those fuckers.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm trying to win the lottery so I can buy me a house next door to Anthony so I can sing that little ditty.  The house next door to him. 
[02:53:30]  Believe me.  They were singing the same thing when Anthony moved in.  Yeah, believe me.  I think you're right.  Hey, I like Rodney.  I like Rodney giving us a little logic today.  I'm the Rodney of my neighborhood.  A lot of people.  Hey, Rodney, hold on a line.  I want to put you on with this.  Sir, I don't know your name because it's not on the screen.  It says, I'm black.  That's all I say.  Is it me?  Can you hear me now?  Yeah.  What's your name, sir?  My name is Al.  Black dude from Summit.  Grew up middle class.  Hey, Rodney, you're still in line, too, if you want to pipe in, but give Al a shot here. 
[02:54:00]  Go ahead, Al.  Hey, Al.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Rodney.  Al.  So the final line is I feel like we're all a product of our environment, and that goes for you as well, Anthony.  So I grew up middle class, black, so I'm surrounded by people who are middle class, black, well-to-do.  My friends, their parents are all doctors and lawyers.  So you're like the black people we see on the commercials on TV. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, basically.  All right.  I'm not, you know, light-skinned with curly hair.  Yeah, basically.  So it's the same thing for you, Anthony.  I mean, if you look, if you go back, and you said before you got on radio you were doing menial jobs and stuff, so look at your environment back then.  Blue-collar guy.  Yeah, all your friends from high school, what are they doing now?  They're not making millions of dollars on the radio.  They're a product of their environment.  A lot of the guys are probably driving trucks and, you know, doing menial labor and stuff like that.  And probably the same for you, Jimmy.  The same for you, O. 
[02:55:00]  Same thing.  I mean, we're all a product of our environment.  Yeah, but I don't think a lot of those guys are in prison or on drugs or dead.  I know a few of them are, but I think there's a disproportionate number of people in the black community that end up in prison, on drugs, or dead.  And it's disproportionate.  You know, but you know something?  A lot of people give up, Anthony.  A lot of people, they go out here and they try, and ones that probably have the same educational level as you have.  And they've gone out there and they've tried, and they're, you know, you did tin knocking for a while. 
[02:55:30]  And they've gone out there and tried, and they gave up.  And they got on drugs.  By the grace of God, you made it out of that.  But Jimmy made a good point the other day when he said something about, you know, you were talking about wine tasting at your house and all this.  He said, you know, you were didn't.  I mean, you were trying to do it or whatever it was.  My white trash fucking wine tasting.  It was weird to hear about that, Rodney.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I remember where Ant came from, and that's very strange. 
[02:56:00]  Ant really is garbage.  He serves beef jerky with wine.  Cleanses the palate.  I saw Ant drink wine out of a fucking box with his mother-in-law a few times.  Hey, it was a box of wine.  But he's come a long way.  Yeah.  I can understand the product of your upbringing and society and stuff.  Society.  I'm trying to get, I just texted Roland.  We're never going to get Louis Farrakhan on this show.  But I would love, say, we have a fucking case here who needs a lot of help. 
[02:56:30]  I don't need no help.  I'll continue, brother.  Well, no, and I also appreciate, Jimmy, you speaking up for the black community.  Maybe we just need Patrice O'Neill to come on.  Boo!  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  No, Patrice is great.  Well, the beauty of Patrice, he just laughs it in.  I love it.  But he puts a lot of things in perspective and knows a lot about white society and black society.  So he's a good litmus test. 
[02:57:00]  He's a good litmus test, if not person.  He's not a good person.  No, he's a horrible person.  We know that.  I hope you asked before whether or not we thought Anthony was a racist or not.  Anthony is a total racist.  All right.  Is this Al?  Total.  Yeah, this is Al.  I still love you.  I call myself a realist, not a racist.  I'm a realist.  I got a question.  Why would you ever love a racist?  Seriously.  Seriously.  He's a real guy.  He's a real...  Because you don't have to hang with him? 
[02:57:30]  Why would you love...  No, I'm being serious.  No, I mean, he's...  At least he tells the truth, right?  There's no...  Yes.  There's no backstabbing.  There's no, like...  It's not subtle at all.  It's out there.  Do you know what else it is?  Let me tell you something, Al.  I probably...  If we hung out, we'd probably be laughing our asses off and have a great time.  Like, there's not...  I don't have a...  I'm not prejudiced.  I might be racist, but I don't prejudge.  But if you had some booze on you, would you give Al a pull? 
[02:58:00]  Would you give him a pull, Ant?  I wouldn't drink out of the same beer bottle.  That's what I'm saying.  But I'd drink a beer with him.  If you just happen to have some of that marijuana, would you be sharing the marijuana?  No, you know how they lip it.  I'll tell you why, Ant.  If there was something wrong with your car, would you...  All right.  Get it.  I'll tell you why Ant's a racist.  Yeah.  It's always about black and white.  It's never...  We never hear about Latinos.  We never hear about Asians. 
[02:58:30]  Well, you hear about the Asians when I'm driving home.  No, we're scared to talk about my drive home.  We're shell-shocked with the Asians, because when we're on regular radio, we thought we're  going to get fired at any moment because of doing Asian humor.  So I think to this day, we're still a little shell-shocked.  Anthony was talking about an Asian driver last week, but never said that.  Can't say Asian while you're talking about it.  He was kind of scared.  Kind of scary.  We're a little shell-shocked still.  Which kind of makes me feel bad for you guys at the Asians.  We're more scared of the Asians than the blacks these days.  It's terrible.  It means you're getting acceptance. 
[02:59:00]  Welcome.  I'm going to get Anthony a copy of Malcolm X's autobiography.  Really?  I certainly am.  You're going to read that.  You're going to read that one.  He'll read it.  Yeah, he would.  He'll throw it in his pool.  I'm going to send him an Obama poster.  Yeah, well, because of the Secret Service, I won't say what I would do with it.  Hang it up?  Get a frame for it?  Exactly.  Frame matted.  It'd be great.  Thank you guys very much.  All right, guys.  Appreciate it.  Rodney and Al.  Thank you, my African brothers. 
[02:59:30]  All right, brothers.  Rodney and Al, man.  I really want to go do a black thing, but nothing crazy.  There are areas that are genuinely dangerous.  I'd go in a second.  I'm not going to fucking Brownsville.  And the truth of the matter is, when shit like that happens, and I'm being honest, I  would hang out with any one of those guys, and after a couple of beers and stuff, you  just laugh and drink and talk.  And I'm not unwilling to sit there and talk.  People get the wrong idea and think I'm just like, get away from me. 
[03:00:00]  That's not the truth.  I am.  But I do have my ideas, and they're not just based on this racism that I was raised with.  I do a lot of research on society, issues of crime, statistics.  I think you do some selective research, though.  No, I really do.  You go to a couple of those websites to get really angry.  No, because, and here's a prime example.  Michael Moore posted that Memorial Day was first thought up or celebrated by former slaves 
[03:00:30]  that put flowers, it was called Decoration Day, that put flowers and decorations, flags  and whatnot, on the graves of Union soldiers that died during the Civil War.  So I'm like doing anything to disprove this, because I hate Michael Moore, and I hate the  thought that this could be revisionist history.  But why didn't you attack Michael Moore when he was in here?  Some people have brought that up over the last couple of years.  I don't know, because we kind of agreed with what we were talking about.  But you really don't like the guy. 
[03:01:00]  But maybe if we talked longer, and the more, I'd know him more now than I did then.  I know more of what he's all about.  So maybe I would.  But when I saw that, all I was thinking was trying to find out if he was bullshitting.  Just prove it, right.  And maybe this is more revisionist history or something.  So I looked, and I researched it, and I found that later on, there was a general that started  the official date, and it was in 1868. 
[03:01:30]  But these two black guys, it was in 65, I believe, started Decoration Day.  And I was like, all right, I just learned something.  That's exactly what happened.  And I didn't tweet, hey, by the way, this general is the real guy that did it.  No, because he was right.  It was two black slaves, former slaves, that paid tribute to some Union soldiers.  Ant does research, but you don't allow, and I'm sure statistically a lot of what you're  saying is correct.  I know it is.  I do a lot of FBI stats.  Absolutely.  Work.  But you have to look, you should watch other stuff, too, which kind of paints the picture 
[03:02:00]  for the first, say, 50 years of the last century.  history, because then it kind of, it puts a perspective on it that the statistics don't  tell, because if things were even all the way through and the statistics were that way,  you'd be 100% right.  Yeah, but I'm more a here and now guy.  Like, I understand, and I understand the history, but I'm not blind to the history, though.  I'm not blind to it.  I think that's where Jimmy's correct.  I know a lot about the history.  I really do.  But I don't think it's as relevant to right now as, I don't, you're putting a lot more 
[03:02:30]  importance on it to what's happening right now than I am.  I know the history, you know the history, but I don't think it's as relevant to what's  going on now as other factors are.  But those people would say it is relevant.  Well, that's good.  And that's why you need a picnic table and a few beers and you need a little Anthony  Kumi, a beer summit.  A beer summit.  You want to do a beer summit?  Some Colt 45.  We'll get some black guys.  I see that as an excuse a lot of times more than reality as, as using the past as a crutch 
[03:03:00]  as to why people act like they do now.  Sometimes I don't like, that's why I don't like using the history so much in the stats  now.  I'll, I'll, I'll go back to the, the late sixties and look at the history from late sixties  till now and look at a lot of positive change that has happened.  And, and I think that negates the, um, the, uh, past.  But I don't, I don't agree because I, when it did, when dealing with people and emotions 
[03:03:30]  and personalities, yeah, it, it, you can't just have a line drawn.  It's, it's much harder.  Like your dad raised you a certain way and like, you know, we joke about it, but you still  by that spaghetti being thrown against the wall, you're still, that affects you.  And that happened in what, 1970 or 73 was a 1930, but here it is 45 years later.  And on a personal level, you're still affected by what your father was taught when he was  a kid. 
[03:04:00]  Sure.  That was taught a certain thing.  So go back.  That's 75 years.  And here you are right now, a good citizen, but your mentality is still kind of a byproduct  of that.  But we all are, but, but we all are exactly.  So, so you can't use that as an excuse as to why you're not, you know, why, why am  I not a fucking naval aviator?  I would have loved to have done that, but why didn't I pursue that?  I'm not using my, was it my past?  Was it my dad?  Was it this?  I'm not going to make an excuse.  I was a lazy fuck. 
[03:04:30]  No, I'm not, I'm not saying as an excuse, but I'm saying when you look at why you are  who you are, good, bad, or indifferent, a lot of that was formed by things that you heard  from your father.  So, okay, let's just say your father was treated like shit by the country and couldn't  fucking piss in the same bathroom and fucking raised you in the sixties going, fuck these  motherfuckers.  All of a sudden now you're supposed to just be like, Hey, America's it's like, it's, that's  why I'm saying it's generational, but not all of a sudden time.  My thing is it's not all of a sudden there's been a gradual enough to change to the positive 
[03:05:00]  where you really have to look at that more so than this.  It didn't happen last Tuesday.  We weren't fucking, you know, uh, whitey wasn't chasing around black people with German  shepherds last week.  This has been a change over the years for the positive for black people in this country  where the opportunities are open for everybody.  And, and it seems to me that people aren't really noticing that.  But isn't it annoying though?  Like when you look back, like, you know how you look back on things from years ago, like 
[03:05:30]  let's say the ex wife or anything that you went through.  But I'm saying like, you don't look back at that and go, well, you know, you're still  bothered by it.  Yeah.  Why aren't you over the ex wife then?  But, but I actually am.  I'm not as angry.  I was angry going through the divorce.  I was, yeah, because of, you know, I go, but, but it's, it's not this.  There's some residuals there, isn't there?  But there was a utter hatred where if, if something, if she would have gotten into a  car accident back in like 2000, 2001, and something horrible would have happened, I 
[03:06:00]  wouldn't have cared in the least.  And that feeling of like utter hatred has gone away.  I don't, I don't hate, I'm not going to carry that around with me.  Um, but at the time, yes.  So if you look at the past like that, you got to go with the flow and realize things  are different now.  But I, and I agree, but can't imagine if every single right within reason, it's like in America, 
[03:06:30]  like I love America, but we really do talk a lot of shit about people having the rights  to do this.  And every group we make fight to get what they want.  Now it's gays, they want this, they want that.  They have to fucking fight and beg, did it to blacks, get a fight and beg.  Women had to fucking fight and beg to vote.  And it's like, after a while, people kind of get annoyed at that.  And when it's, when there's a long history of that, people just get fucking fed up and  we're still in the fed up place. 
[03:07:00]  And I'm not excusing fucking violent behavior.  I hate it, but you got to be realistic about it.  Okay, so we just got to throw that into the discussion.  So how many years you give me, if nothing changes, where you finally go, all right, Anthony,  I've had it.  I'm with you.  How many years?  I don't even think you need to go that far.  If by July 8th, things aren't better, I'm getting a giant N tattooed on my chest.  I've had enough black people.  Going back to Anthony doing something black. 
[03:07:30]  Quick story.  I had someone do a mural in my house.  He wasn't black, by the way.  J.J. Evans.  He was definitely a young, liberal guy with his really good looking girlfriend and a  liberal couple, young.  And her hairy pussy in under arms.  Probably mid-20s.  And they were talking about how they go to restaurants in Harlem.  And we were trying to like, you know, expand and try to find some new shit to do in New York  City.  Yeah.  And I looked it up.  It's a place called Spoonbread.  He goes, this is a...  Motherfucking Spoonbread?  He goes, there's a great soul food place up in Harlem. 
[03:08:00]  It's called Spoonbread.  I think you guys would really like it.  You know, they didn't know us that well, but enough to suggest this restaurant.  So on a Friday night, and I'm like...  And I even said, because I do have my own comfort zone.  I go, is it the safe part of Harlem?  He goes, oh yeah, it's safe up there.  No problem.  You wouldn't even worry.  So on one Friday, I said, let's go to the Spoonbread and check it out.  It was before we had the kid.  Because I don't think I'd go up there with my extremely white kid, by the way.  And you'd probably be safer with the kid than without the kid. 
[03:08:30]  But this is my comfort zone.  I'm just adding to the...  So we drove up there on a Friday.  It was kind of dark.  We drove right up to the fucking place.  And I was scared out of my fucking mind.  And I drove away.  Ah, really?  Wow.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I had an open mind going into it.  And then my comfort zone, I realized I wasn't as comfortable.  And then I looked up the address here.  It's 547 Malcolm X Boulevard.  Malcolm X Boulevard.  But to this guy, he thought it might be. 
[03:09:00]  He said it's a really safe, really good soul food place.  He's uncomfortable, too.  Go with your instincts.  You won't admit it.  Right.  He's fucking uncomfortable.  I know he is.  A little bit.  Because, and again, hipsters are pretty ballsy.  They will live in black neighborhoods.  They're not total pussies.  But to go to a place like that that you know other people will be uncomfortable,  he's just trying to be the white guy who's not at all uncomfortable.  Right.  But I bet you, I mean, the phones are lit and they're all on hold,  so I don't know.  No one's going to get through right now.  But I bet you someone will call me out and go,  dude, that is like fucking safe shit in Harlem. 
[03:09:30]  But you know what?  But that was my fucking comfort.  You go with your fucking instincts, I think.  Yeah.  I think, was it more, was it more, now, now, the feeling you had.  Was it a visceral, instinctual feeling?  Or was it a mental, calculated?  The area.  I don't think this area.  The area in general looked kind of shady for my liking.  That's all.  Yeah.  I didn't see anything in particular.  It was just a weird feeling.  I'm like, I don't know, man.  Okay, so it was more instinctual than,  I don't like the way that guy looks.  Oh, it was definitely instinctual. 
[03:10:00]  Absolutely.  All right, okay.  But supposedly this place does well.  It's not like a down and dirty place.  It's, you know, it's a middle of the road, soul food type restaurant.  Yeah.  It's not high end, it's not low end.  It's just kind of there.  Interesting.  And we drove and I'm like, I looked at her and she looked at me.  I'm like, yeah, we're not ready.  We're not ready to take this kind of chance.  That's for sure.  Let's go to Beacon.  Not until I get my carry.  Yeah.  And then we went back downtown and back into the comfort zone.  Hey, there you go.  I mean, we've joked about it a lot on this show. 
[03:10:30]  Everyone knows how far uptown they could go before they get a little scared.  Yeah.  You know, right around 100, you start kind of looking around a little bit.  Yeah, you do.  It doesn't mean that it's scary, but all of a sudden your senses are a little more acute.  You get up into the 120s, you're in a, holy shit, what the fuck am I doing here, Mark?  Yeah, yeah.  So, I hear you.  But with that said, I'm wondering if we should go to this place during the day to give you your black experience.  We should do something during, I can't do it during the show.  I say I'm calling and. 
[03:11:00]  Well, that stays in one day, and we'll go for like an early lunch.  We'll videotape it or something.  We should be given a tour by somebody who is, you know.  Knows the area.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  A chamber of commerce person.  Yeah.  Or eight white cops escorting us.  Or that.  But I want Farrakhan on this program.  You know what?  He'd hate me, too.  That would be great.  I'm not delusional.  Well, I would like that. 
[03:11:30]  This place is called Soul Food 2, T-O-O, and this one is way up on, wow, that looks like  close to 135, 140.  That can be dicey.  I want to really go far.  But I don't, I wasn't, I don't think I was that high up, to be honest with you.  I want to go really far north, like the Tappan Z.  So, but we should do something like that.  Not even in the city.  Get it.  Yeah, they're Tappan W or X, Tappan Z, like, give me the Z, I'm going to tap them. 
[03:12:00]  We got to change gears, just because Jim Norton's in the paper today, and it sucks to just do  a casual mention.  Oh, that's fine.  You got a pretty big spread.  It's cool.  Oh.  Yes.  What was all...  Spread his cheeks.  Yes.  That's how I got it.  I opened my asshole for the editor, and he put his little fingers in there.  I'm actually trying to tweet...  What was this about, Jimmy?  They did, uh...  They do an article on, uh, and I'm tweeting a link.  It's about people whose apartments get them, help them get laid. 
[03:12:30]  And, um, they asked me if I wanted to do it, so I sent photos of my apartment, because  I have a nice apartment.  And, um...  There you do.  And I'm like, yeah, it has helped me get laid in the past.  I mean, again, I've been with a girl for fucking, you know, two and a half years.  It's almost, you know...  But I've had my...  I had a couple of single years in there.  And, uh...  Yeah, it helps.  It was just about to be a nice place.  It doesn't help you get laid.  And, uh...  I said, yeah, it does.  So I sent some photos.  Yeah.  And there's a picture of me in the post.  Like an asshole with my arms open. 
[03:13:00]  Like, yeah?  And my fucking giant kiss poster behind me.  You're like, ah, what do you want from me?  Did you see this yet?  Yeah.  No, I can't find the picture.  Where is the picture?  Oh, here it is.  It's called Welcome Ladies.  There's pictures of my apartment.  I took the pictures except for the one of me.  Welcome.  That's my bedroom.  With the big, huge Kiss Alive poster.  Kiss Alive, too, yeah.  Above the bed.  That's great.  Yeah, it's the...  But I took the nighttime photos of my kitchen and my living room.  And they use them.  It's a pretty good article.  I don't know. 
[03:13:30]  It's just a little bit embarrassing.  Why?  Because you never...  I've never been good at having good things and people knowing it.  But, um...  It's in today's post.  So grab the poster.  More willing to sleep with you.  Yeah, it's true.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  That's good.  Is that a real thing, you think?  Of course.  NYC's new shag pads.  You bring a girl back to the apartment and if it's that nice, then they're...  They're more like...  If they're on the...  No chick who doesn't absolutely want to fuck you.  If they're on the fence, that could be...  It helps, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a deal closer.  It is to a certain... 
[03:14:00]  Ant's apartment would turn a chick...  Would turn like a lesbian feminist into eating his ass.  Like, that's the kind of place Anthony has.  I don't have that kind of place.  I just have a nice enough apartment where for girls, on the fence.  Because I have a big kitchen.  Which gives the illusion that I'm like a gentleman who will go...  Right.  I don't cook.  At all.  At all.  Somebody pointed at the stove.  And I'm like, alright, I guess that's what that is.  Or was that the chick again?  No, that's so Ant's type, though, and I saw him looking.  Very pale.  That was your type, wasn't it? 
[03:14:30]  She was like fucking typing paper.  Yeah, she had that look.  She really was.  She had the look you go for.  Yeah, of course.  Ghost.  She was a lovely girl.  It's called white trash.  You know what?  I'll play my hand.  I would go with the ghetto girl before that girl.  Ghetto girl before the white girl?  Yeah, absolutely.  That particular white girl.  Yeah?  I didn't see what she looked like.  I'd be on that.  I would be on the ghetto girl.  No.  The ghetto girl was hot.  I would be on the ghetto girl.  Is there a scenario where you would be on the ghetto girl? 
[03:15:00]  The old desert island.  Is that really it?  I don't know.  Is that really it?  I'd trade her for a white girl.  Okay.  I don't.  You'd trade her for an ugly white girl?  Yeah.  An ugly white girl.  That's true.  Can I have a funny looking white girl, please?  Because in the ghetto, she's up there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her number's up there.  So you would take that and you'd have to trade down to an ugly white girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in.  That's so fucking bad. 
[03:15:30]  That's great, man.  I didn't even see that picture, though, of Jimmy and the ass.  It is a lovely photo.  Thumbing through?  They took a bunch of pictures.  I feel like a dick is my mom's roping, but I was kind of joking with her.  Look at this.  I have a problem tweeting pictures from my house.  I don't know.  Oh, look at the picture.  It comes up on me on the iPhone.  Yay!  That's cool.  I just kind of like the privacy part of it.  I'm tweeting a little bit more.  I've tweeted a couple views.  You can get a corner or something of a room or one thing. 
[03:16:00]  You just don't put them all together, I guess.  No, they do, though.  Yeah, they do.  You know when I was...  Speck out a floor plan.  When I was tweeting just a little piece of that dumb painting I got for my wedding.  Someone put together the pieces so you could almost see what it is already.  Oh, really?  I didn't think they would do that, but I guess of course they would.  They'd do that.  I'm just tweeting this because it helps.  I'm doing another TV festival, though, after The Wire. 
[03:16:30]  I was trying to find something to watch.  And Breaking Bad.  See Breaking Bad?  It's like the father from Malcolm in the Middle.  He's got the cancer, and he's making meth to get enough money for his family before he dies.  Oh, Jesus.  It's pretty fucking good, though.  And, you know, I don't like anything medical, so they don't really delve into that part of it and shit.  It's more this, you know, what he's trying to do to get money and how he just keeps getting deeper and deeper into shit.  Wow.  And that's a good show. 
[03:17:00]  I like that one.  Is it going to be cured by the end of the series?  I doubt it.  And the good thing is the series is still on.  Right.  So no one knows the ending.  You ever watch that cancer show where she's dying?  No, I don't watch that.  Holy fuck.  Because that whole thing is about the cancer.  I ain't watching that shit.  This is about a guy who's got the cancer.  He's like, oh, well, I got the cancer.  But now he's going to fucking start cooking meth to try to make money for his family.  Seems very similar to the other one that was about the cancer.  Yeah, but that was a little too much.  That was the mom who has the cancer.  She's just trying to figure out everything before she goes. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Deeply fucking depressing.  Yeah, this isn't...  A couple of those episodes.  This isn't depressing.  This is like fucking kind of action-packed and kind of like suspenseful.  You're like, oh, shit.  You know, what the fuck is this?  That means he's going to be all right in the end.  And then he's like, fuck, if I knew I was all right, I wouldn't have done all this shit.  Now I'm in real trouble.  I don't know.  He's got like that fucking good luck, bro, cancer.  The lung cancer thing.  Good luck, bro.  Good boy.  My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, people are saying I've got to watch. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, people have been tweeting that one saying it's a good one to check out.  Is that phony?  Is that a fake thing I've got to watch?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did we do everything else for today?  We didn't play Farrakhan, but I guess that's going to be my loss because I'm a fan.  Oh, the Farrakhan Mike Wallace?  Just Google it when you get home on YouTube.  He beats Mike Wallace the fuck up.  That's great.  We've got to talk about the hottest story of the day.  You have an 85-year-old woman.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  What the fuck?  I know. 
[03:18:30]  What the fuck, dude?  Why'd she have to open her big mouth?  Yeah.  Twice.  We did the wiener thing.  By the way, you know what a man you have to be to keep your dick hard?  First of all, just touching an old lady's neck would make my dick fucking wilt.  This guy grabbed an 85-year-old fucking woman by the neck and forced her into a vestibule  and made her suck his dick.  And then robbed her.  That's a fucking man.  I mean, he's a bad guy, but if you're a dick to stay hard through that, you're a fucking  trooper.  Madison Avenue and East 83rd.  That's a good area.  540 in the morning. 
[03:19:00]  What is she doing walking around at 540 in the morning?  Looking for dick, apparently.  I have to pee up right back.  I can't hold it.  That's hilarious.  I'm coming right back.  I can't hold it.  All right.  Go make wee-wees.  Police are hunting for the fiend who sexually assaulted and robbed an 85-year-old woman out  for a stroll on the Upper East Side.  Geez.  While strolling through the park one day.  By the way, they do mention that he's a Hispanic man in his 20s.  Yeah.  About 5'10".  They'll mention that.  It's a victim.  She weighed 100 pounds. 
[03:19:30]  A 100-pound 81-year-old, huh?  Well, how could you resist?  Wouldn't you believe in the death penalty with a story like this?  Yes.  I completely believe in the death penalty.  Well, we all believe in the death penalty.  And that's some kind of, like...  Obviously, it's not even close to a death penalty case, but that's just, like, that's  just fucking wrong.  That is a wild sickness kind of a thing.  Like, that isn't even...  That's not curable.  And that, I don't think...  They don't have a pill for that.  No.  And that, I don't think, has anything to do with sex or fucking sexual pleasure. 
[03:20:00]  That guy is fucking doing something to try to remedy a problem he's got.  That's the type of guy you're fucking scared of.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the type of guy that'll keep you awake at night.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they didn't catch him, did they?  Nope.  They got some video of him.  What are they blocking out in those still pictures?  Oh, the girl.  Oh, the girl.  The lady?  The grandma, yeah.  The grandma?  Yeah.  Are they blocking it out because there's some sex going on? 
[03:20:30]  Are they blocking it out because they're trying to save her, protect her identity?  No, no, no, no.  See, that's when he was dragging her.  Yeah, yeah.  You see the car's in the background.  Oh, from the back, so you could see her face.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he had his arm around her neck, and he's dragging her away.  Yeah.  And, yeah, then pulls her down into, like, a vestibule brownstone thing.  And that's just security camera, huh?  Down below she took her a little bit.  Yeah.  Street cams are everywhere.  Amazing with those cameras.  And no matter what happens, man, you are on it.  But all old people look alike, so are you really protected? 
[03:21:00]  You're not protected.  Look, she's got blue hair, and she's short and fucking old.  Just a horrible, horrible.  He's fucking, yeah.  Just a horrible fucking story.  Yeah, that guy's fucked.  What else from the weekend?  I think we, oh, Hangover Part 2.  We kind of said that, right?  Huge.  Five-day opening, $137 million, making it the biggest opening ever for a comedy.  And like I said, I nailed the review.  I said the movie obviously would do really well, but it's not as good as the first. 
[03:21:30]  And I think now that a lot of people have seen it, I would agree.  But there were definitely some great, you know, great little scenes in it.  Yeah, I have no want to see it.  I'll wait until it's on cable.  You just never got into the Hangover movies, huh?  Nah, nah.  I saw the first one, you know, in a hotel, and then I'll watch this one.  Did you laugh at all at the first one?  Yeah, a couple of moments.  Nothing like, like, holy shit, this is great.  For the people that have now seen the movie, how douche-chilling was that fucking Mike Tyson cameo?  Bad, huh?  Got to give it a little more time, and then we'll talk about it. 
[03:22:00]  I mean, by next Monday, sorry, but we're talking about Hangover 2.  The ins and outs, but we'll give you a couple more days to see this fucking thing.  But the Mike Tyson cameo, it was, ugh, what a douche-chill.  And I think that's about it.  Oh, this just coming in, deadly tour bus accident, another one, I-95 in Virginia.  And they had the video on the TV, well, the bus on its side. 
[03:22:30]  What the fuck is up with those tour buses?  Got to fall asleep, he's snoozing.  What's up with these tour buses?  Snoozing at the wheel?  We'll find out.  That's what happens.  Yeah.  They just took a tour of a ditch.  Stop here.  Look at this.  I'd like to see those flowers close up.  And some gravel.  I'd like some gravel in my face.  Have you seen the Hangover movies?  No.  I don't see.  No Desire?  No.  I'm sure they're funny, but I could care less.  You don't see a lot of comedies in general, do you?  No Desire to see most of them.  What was the last comedy you saw? 
[03:23:00]  I know you see the old ones, like all of us.  What was the last comedy you actually went and saw?  I had to.  I know, but Amistad would have been Portami.  I know, but people probably wouldn't know what that is.  Wait, the last comedy I went to see?  Well, you know, you've got to screen a copy.  Observing Report.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, right, yeah.  I've seen other comedies because we were interviewing people.  Like, I've been watching.  I told you, I've been rededicating myself to reading.  I'm going to go over every fucking biography that we've had people in for and whatever. 
[03:23:30]  Like, I'm on Brock's book right now.  I finished fucking Sugar Ray's.  I finished fucking Brian Johnson.  I'm on Brock's, and I started Flaves.  I'm going to fucking barrel through these fucking pages.  I just hate how long reading takes.  I'm just tired of that.  I wish you could read in, like, you know, like a movie's two hours.  I wish you could just pick up a book, and two hours later, you're done with it.  You think we'll get spoken like a true idiot?  Do you think we'll get to the point of technology where there'll be something that just soaks 
[03:24:00]  in this info?  Where you don't have to spend the time reading a 500 fucking page?  Like some kind of computer?  Yeah, something.  I don't know.  Yes, I do.  You hook up, and it's like, all right, you want to soak in this book?  Yeah.  And it's all right there?  Yeah.  You really think?  Yeah.  Don't we have that guy coming back that, uh, what was his name?  Cruz.  Yeah, Ray Cruz.  Ray.  Like you plug one of those things in your head?  Something.  I don't know.  What are they called?  We don't have to read every stupid word.  A hair?  Yeah, yeah, that.  You plug hair in your head? 
[03:24:30]  It was pointing at his head.  People couldn't see.  Like you slip it in.  But no, I think you're right.  You will eventually just, you know, fucking pop it in a hard drive.  Like Ray, that's what Ray would say.  It'd be all in a hard drive.  Yeah.  And information will, once they learn how the brain shows images.  But it would have to be presented in a way like a book.  Like when you read a book, you do kind of come up with the mental images.  And it's a weird, I think two different people reading the same book obviously have a different  interpretation.  Sure, Mein Kampf.  Mein Kampf.  You know, I could read that and chuckle. 
[03:25:00]  And, you know, other people.  But it would have to be presented in that way where you're still getting that feeling  where your own personality and shit kind of affects the way you interpret the book.  It happens on a very smaller scale of movies.  Because, you know, obviously people watch movies and see it a little differently.  But I think with a book, you really kind of, what you visualize, how you visualize a character  instead of, you know, okay, that's Gary Sinise.  You know, and that's a, but I picture the character. 
[03:25:30]  When I read the book, he looked a little more like this.  Like you could put it together yourself.  So that's why I think it would be kind of hard to do something like that.  I can't think of how, I don't know, I can't think of an example of how much faster we get  information now.  By the time that's possible, it will just be commonplace that that's how you get information.  Like stuff, time spent learning arithmetic and all that stuff and how to speak the language  will be seen as a waste of time.  Just like we look at when people had to fucking sharpen a rock before they could cut an antelope's 
[03:26:00]  asshole out and eat it as a waste of time.  We're like, you had to do that?  We just buy this shit and fucking eat it and it's done.  Great way of looking at it.  You had to spend eight hours fucking carving that faggot animal up while fucking apes were  running at you.  Well, I took computer programming in college.  That was a complete waste of time.  You don't need any of that shit.  I had three or four little computer languages I was studying at the time.  I had to fucking get my tattoo removed?  Fucking.  Oh, which one?  I had fucking DOS prompt on my thighs. 
[03:26:30]  It was hot.  Girls loved it.  We talked about the old lady.  We didn't add much to that.  What could you add?  Fucking two boners?  How hot is that?  Teeth probably fell out.  Fucking shameful.  She just took charm bracelets fucking jingling around.  Those big fucking Spanish crack balls.  Because nobody is not on a crack binge who fucks an old lady's mouth at 530 in the morning.  Did you think that guy was on his way to the library?  Oh, no.  My book is late. 
[03:27:00]  Let me club her and fuck her face.  That's not what happened.  He needed drug money.  She was strolling around with her cunty old purse.  And he's like, ah, I bet there's some good drug money in there.  And then he fucking hit her.  And she probably yelled.  And when he saw how fucking wide her mouth could open, he's like, ah-ha.  Ah-ha-ha.  Grabbed her by the neck.  I got an idea.  He grabbed her by the neck like a fucking cartoon chicken and fucking threw her in the  other room and gave her fucking, her mouth a good fucking, a good fucking tonsil hockeying. 
[03:27:30]  But it's a horrible tragedy.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  Yes, yes.  For both of them.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Believe me, you think his memories are good?  Mm-hmm.  Imagine coming out of a fucking, a drug-induced stupor and you smell something.  Yeah.  And it just smells like a food you wouldn't have eaten.  Oh.  Your dick smells like cat food because that's what she was eating.  I don't know why I'm being so mean to the old lady.  Ah, whatever.  It's a terrible, terrible story.  It's horrible.  No, that's just another story.  Oh, Ray Kurzweil.  Did we get his name yet?  Yes. 
[03:28:00]  Okay.  A-ching-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a.  A-ching-a-lang-a.  That's the charm bracelet.  A-ching-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a.  A-ching-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a.  Yo, bitch, jiggle them balls.  You're doing all.  He jiggle them balls.  She's getting no teeth in.  He's holding her teeth.  He's yelling.  He's like mocking.  He's moving the teeth, yelling at her.  Don't let them balls, bitch.  She's jingling in his balls with her fucking charm bracelet.  That's fucking.  Holy shit.  Puerto Rican guy fucking crack ball sweat leaking onto her. 
[03:28:30]  Charm bracelet.  It's terrible.  I don't mean a word to me, boys.  Terribly funny.  I know.  I'm squeezing my dick as I talk.  Of course you are.  Yeah.  Wow.  You got anything, Jimmy?  Back from vacation day one.  Vacation?  Back from our four-day, three-day weekend.  You haven't seen a vacation.  Wait till later this summer.  You're going to see a vacation.  At least two weeks.  Two weeks.  Jimmy, you got anything for Andy? 
[03:29:00]  Oh, just June 15th in Chicago, opening night of the festival.  And I'm doing Hannity this Thursday.  Ah, yeah.  I got a call from Hannity.  I don't remember the date, but yeah, I guess they're putting the word out.  I guess they need some hilarity.  He called me and I hung up on him promptly.  But I said I would do his show.  Oh, Sean.  I love Anthony.  Sean Hannity goes to him, so you think he'll really do my show?  And you go, no.  I go, no.  No.  No. 
[03:29:30]  Maybe I'll just fucking do it.  I don't know why you don't.  I love doing this show.  That'll shut him up.  It's fun.  All right, boys.  Let's say it all.  Bye, everybody.  Take it easy, everybody.  Have fun.  We'll see you mañana.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Obi.  ELE3.  DELTA ELE3 SHOW.  Damn it, damn it. </pre>
