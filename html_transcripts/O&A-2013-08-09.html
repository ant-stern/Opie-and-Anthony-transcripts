<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and boisterous introduction, immediately launching into a discussion of a listener-submitted video of a woman twerking on the beach while preparing for a surfing competition, accompanied by the song "Bubble Butt."  Their commentary focused heavily on the woman's physique.  This transitioned into a discussion about the naming of a Loverboy album, punctuated by further crude jokes and tangents.  A caller, "Mike the Trucker," phoned in with a dubious claim about a leaked Homeland Security memo detailing potential Al-Qaeda attacks in Austin and Pasadena.  The hosts expressed skepticism. The surfer girl video was revisited, followed by relentless mockery of Sam, a staff member's, clothing choices. Opie then detailed his surprisingly positive experience with a recent root canal, highlighting the attractive dental staff.  This led to more vulgar jokes and a discussion of Jason Alexander's hairpiece, further fueling their comedic banter.

The show continued with more playful mockery of Jason Alexander's wig and a discussion of a Lady Gaga video featuring nudity and Yoko Ono's singing style, described as "screamy shit." A significant portion focused on E-Rock's terrible day, encompassing car trouble, a broken tooth, and a resulting emotional connection to his vintage Ninja Turtles toy collection (which, according to speculation, contained semen in some bags).  This transitioned into a discussion about the Grateful Dead, disliked songs, song structure, and requests for "Classical Gas" and ELO's "Fire on High," which were subsequently played.  E-Rock's attempts to appear younger were also comedically addressed.  The segment concluded with Anthony recounting a road rage incident involving a pedestrian throwing coffee at his car and a previous incident where the same pedestrian damaged his side-view mirror. The hosts discussed their marriages and played "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" by the Allman Brothers Band.

The next segment began with a discussion of a tedious song contrasted with Young MC's "Bust a Move," along with mockery of Young MC's career and social media presence.  This segued into a discussion of Twitter verification, their own verification process (mentioning publicist Jenny Hutt), and complaints about other verified accounts. The hosts then shared anecdotes about 70s concerts, drug and alcohol use, and someone throwing fireworks at a concert.  This led to a full performance of "Bust a Move," followed by criticism of a Kmart back-to-school commercial and a series of "Yo Mama" jokes.  A news story about a dead shark found on a subway was discussed, leading to mocking commentary on Stephanie Bannister, a young Australian political candidate, and other perceived "dumb" political figures like Dan Quayle, Sarah Palin, and Anthony Weiner.  A-Rod's return to the Yankees and the Daily News's reaction ("Boo the Bum") were also mentioned.  A significant portion focused on intern Jackie's last day, with (mostly sarcastic) compliments on her attire, comparisons to other interns (Troy Kwan and Sidney), and discussion of intern behavior in general. The segment concluded with recollections of and insults directed toward former management, Bruce Mittman and Dave Dickless.

A subsequent segment reminisced about a past CD release and the challenges of donating the proceeds to charity due to their reputation as "scumbags," eventually settling on a charity for African-American disabled Vietnam veterans.  A phone call with Bruce Mittman, their former general manager, followed, with Mittman recounting numerous anecdotes, using his nickname for the hosts ("shwoogies" or "shwuggies"), and jokes about babysitting Mittman's children.  The hosts attempted to dial his number, leading to humorous misdials and disconnected calls.  This segment also featured intern Jackie and her mother, who received a cake and a musical send-off from Ryan Starr, a musical guest who performed songs and shared anecdotes.

The final segment centered on Jackie's extravagant farewell, including a cake, balloons, and a surprise serenade by Ryan Starr, with Jackie's mother present.  The hosts compared this to Sydney's similarly excessive farewell, discussing intern experiences and their history with past interns. Ryan Starr, the musical guest, discussed his career, music, and opinions on Rihanna's Instagram presence.  Callers phoned in, including Larry from Louisiana, who complimented Ryan Starr's music. Jackie's future plans and her mother's reaction were discussed, concluding the show with Loverboy's "Working for the Weekend."

Let's get this show on the road.  Ah, good morning everybody.  Hi.  We are live.  Hi.  Live radio at its best.  Good morning to ya.  Hey, everybody.  Hey, everybody. 
[00:02:30]  We're a guitar of the weekend.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Hey.  Make sure you talk to your listeners.  Oh, that's right.  I should have said hello, everybody.  Well, not everybody.  Hello to you!  Hey, hi, you.  You right there in your car!  Wait, what?  They're not in their car, though.  So you gotta make it even more vague than that.  Friday.  Have fun. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You see what you do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh.  That video rolls.  We got two videos today that roll right off the bat.  Yeah.  The chick warming up for the surfing competition that I retweeted late last night.  Yeah, she's on the fucking beach just going to town with her ace. 
[00:03:30]  What is this?  The Lover Boy Working for the Weekend video?  Ah, they all had to do a little thing before the song started.  A little thing.  What?  Shit.  What's going on with this video?  What's going on?  Right here.  Right here.  That's easy for you.  What is this?  You get to go out rocking any time.  Wait, is this their little vignette before the song?  Oh, I gotta watch the whole vignette.  I didn't know there was a vignette before working for the weekend. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah, man.  These guys all wanted to be, you know, movie stars.  So they did their little vignettes before the song started.  It's like two and a half minutes long.  Oh, Jesus.  What are they doing?  Well, the boy decided it's worth two and a half minutes.  Wow.  They're so fucking talented that it's worth doing a two and a half minute vignette before  the song actually starts.  Let's do this.  Stay with it.  They're in a big theater. 
[00:04:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  I walked in the office and I figured this is what the title is going to be on the album  and I get a totally different story from the management company, right?  And I'm going, what's going on here?  Are they Canadian?  That's right.  I thought it was going to be only the lucky ones.  I was into that title.  I figure it came from a time when I was in Vegas for a week.  Wasn't doing so good.  And I phoned in and said, God, one of these days I'm going to get lucky. 
[00:05:00]  Lucky, my dog.  What?  The little guy that follows me around.  Sir, he comes on the road with us.  You're crazy.  What are you talking about?  He's the guy who fills a void on all those long nights.  How do you think I make it through them?  So I went to the record company.  I said, look it.  We don't dedicate this next album.  They are Canadian, right?  I'm a dog.  Very.  I'm out.  Canadian zone.  I'm out.  You're lucky.  I'm out.  There you go.  Lucky, not in here.  Anybody got a towel?  I don't believe you either. 
[00:05:30]  I don't believe all you guys because it doesn't really matter.  He's the David Letterman looking guy.  You could be called Watch Out.  It could be called Jump.  It could be called Emotional.  It could be called Gangs in the Street.  It could be called Take It to the Top.  Wrong.  Take it to the Top.  Take it to the Top.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  What is this?  Wrong.  What is this?  Right style.  It's a valid opinion.  It all started when I sang Get Lucky.  It comes from you, right?  I sang Get Lucky on the tape.  I just felt like saying Get Lucky just before Dean went into his guitar break. 
[00:06:00]  That's where it all started.  Oh, wonderful.  And everybody knows it's a national pastime anyways to Get Lucky.  Come five o'clock, everybody I know hits the bar in hopes of getting lucky.  Why are they even talking about the Loverboy song Get Lucky?  The buck stops here.  Trying to figure out who named it.  Right.  So stupid.  Does anyone care?  No.  You get to go out rocking anytime you want, right?  You get to go down to Vegas anytime you want to blow all your bucks if you want.  I don't care.  And you get to sit there.  Hey, Mr. Opinion, Mr. Blase, right? 
[00:06:30]  But I got commitments.  I got responsibilities.  Fucking arms.  Every night for the past 10 years, I got to go home to my wife and kids like a faithful  dog.  Just like you.  My heart cries for you.  Hell, I'm never going to get lucky.  Yeah, right.  Oh, he's crossing his fingers behind us.  And then why are they going to working for the weekend?  I don't know.  That was the oddest thing I've ever seen a band do.  Well, they all try to do their vignettes before the big song. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was a whole discussion on who, what, came up with the album title?  Was it the album called Get Lucky?  I don't know.  I don't fucking know.  Who the fuck knows?  This guy wants us to break some news, I guess.  Hold on, man.  Breaking news.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike the Trucker.  Mike E.  It's a pleasure, sir.  A pleasure to be talking to you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Listen, I wanted to get you guys just.  Uh, information just because nobody knows about it yet. 
[00:07:30]  It just broke an hour ago.  So that means it.  Hold on, hold on.  No offense, but no one knows about this yet.  It broke an hour ago.  That means people know about it now.  Everyone knows about it.  Okay.  It's not on the mainstream news yet.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  If you go to InfoWars.com, Miles Jones' site.  Of course.  There is a memo that came out from the Department of Homeland Security to the Austin, Texas Police Department and the Pasadena, California Police Department detailing that they had reports of potential Al-Qaeda attacks in both cities today. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, it's a false flag operation.  Yeah, exactly.  It's supposed to be exactly like the backpack bombing.  It goes through the exact details on the memo that is posted up there of backpacks and the two locations or potential locations for the attacks. 
[00:08:30]  Wait, Austin, Texas and Pasadena, California?  Pasadena, California.  I wanted to let you know so we could say, you know, if I need to set it, false flag attack.  All right.  So when it happens, or if it happens and it comes out on the news, then you heard it from a trucker.  All right.  You know, somebody's just out here on the road.  That's it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:09:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Well, thanks for that timely information.  Yes.  That last caller was full of shit.  That article is from.  I know.  I know.  Mikey, thank you, though, sir.  We'll be sitting on pins and needles.  Oh, yeah.  We're watching.  All right.  We got all the news channels on.  InfoWars is usually at the forefront of the news that comes out that day.  Right.  It's not ever known as some fucking wild. 
[00:09:30]  The beauty of running a website like InfoWars.com, you only need one out of a thousand to be  right.  To be right.  Right.  And then you're like, see?  Obviously, you know, I have this information.  My source is very, very close to the situation.  They know.  And I have told everybody, but no one wants to listen to me.  All right.  Where were we?  We got, oh, so the girl warming up for a surfing competition. 
[00:10:00]  I retweeted it late last night.  She's like twerking on the beach.  I saw the video probably ten times last night.  And what's her name?  Surfer Anastasia Ashley or something like that?  Anastasia Ashley.  Twerking warm-up dance.  This video, okay, it really is taking off.  It's done another million views since yesterday.  What's her deal?  Okay, this thing is going viral all over the place.  It's ridiculous.  And then Mars and Sam both have to just throw it away like, ah, her ass is too, what did 
[00:10:30]  you say?  She's too skinny?  Yeah, sure.  I prefer her to be less skinny.  Do you see how she moves that ass?  Yes.  Stop.  I didn't say it was bad.  She's fucking surfed, so she's got, you know, she's in great shape.  Great shape.  She's very athletic.  What's wrong with you?  And I like the song they used.  Bubble Butt?  Bubble Butt.  Yeah, I know the song.  Yeah, I know Bubble Butt.  I do.  Dre's in there somewhere.  Dr. Dre?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, it's a Dre thing.  Dr. Dre?  Yep.  Yep, it's Dre and I think maybe Drake. 
[00:11:00]  Yo, Drake.  I think this is a Dre Drake thing.  I think Dr. Dre is actually a doctor now.  Yes.  Yeah, doctor of beats.  Oh.  I thought he was treating people for various illnesses.  Doctor of beats.  That would be great if he decided to do that and really become Dr. Dre.  You go there and, you know, you fill out your paperwork and you go and proceed to the  doctor.  Right.  Yes, hi, I'm Dr. Dre.  Yo, it's Dre.  Well, we'll put this video on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, or if you follow me 
[00:11:30]  on Twitter, Opie Radio.  What's her deal?  You can check out the videos we talk about.  Huh?  Are there any other videos of her?  Is she like a famous surfer?  Anthony, I searched a bit.  Yeah?  I don't see any other videos.  I wouldn't doubt you had searched a bit.  I searched a bit.  I didn't see any more videos of her doing her thing.  That's her, huh?  Yeah, that's skinny, all right.  Whoa.  Yep.  Too skinny, all right, Sam.  And Mars, who barely looked at the screen, by the way.  I looked at the whole video. 
[00:12:00]  Surfer.  What do you mean the whole video?  I watched the whole video.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, but the whole time you were going ick.  Yuck.  No, I wasn't.  Ew, ew.  A lot of ewes.  Ew, where's the cough you were saying?  Ew, ew.  I don't know if you were saying that.  Oh, man.  Is this her, too?  Yeah.  Is she working out?  She's got to work.  All right.  Oh, no.  Oh, we got a situation here.  We got a butter face.  Is that a situation?  A situire. 
[00:12:30]  It's a situation.  Oh, boy.  That so takes away from it.  She's got a really nice body, but her face is.  She's just got an average face.  Look at that beach picture.  I don't see a beach.  What's wrong with you?  I see an ass.  I see a hiney.  Where's the beach?  Well, don't look past it.  And you're looking at Sam.  You're going to ask.  Focus on the screen in front.  Sam ruins everything.  He does. 
[00:13:00]  You need to be, like, let go.  You ruin everything.  And BTW, look at him again today.  I know.  Now he's got a picnic table plaid shirt on.  He's making everyone uncomfortable because he's outdressing everybody, including the hosts  of the radio show.  And then there's a cool surfing video where the girl's warming up, and then he has to show  me a video where it shows that her face is just average at best.  Meh.  You guys get really upset by me.  Yes, we are.  It's about time you realize it. 
[00:13:30]  Why are you dressing like this?  You won't tell us.  I like it.  I don't.  No one else does.  But why did you decide to start dressing nicer?  Because I thought it was time.  I got tired of wearing...  Well, for what reason?  I got tired of wearing a t-shirt and jeans and sneakers every day.  Yeah, God forbid.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.  We're the lucky ones.  We get to come in here.  I came in here with pajamas the other day with a blown out crotch.  Did you name the lover boy thing?  Oh, I did.  We're the lucky ones.  I certainly did.  But we're lucky.  We could come in here pretty much in anything. 
[00:14:00]  Yes.  So why do you ruin it?  I'm not mad at it.  I once had management say, will you pull up your pants?  And I'm not even a black dude.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to...  When you're...  Well, look.  Maybe if I was...  I think some pubic hair was sticking out.  Oh, God.  And he had to actually say, will you pull up your pants?  Pull up your goddamn pants.  It wasn't even pants.  Will you pull up your sweats?  Oh, sorry, sir.  When you're a millionaire, that's kind of fun.  Excuse me.  What?  I'm sorry.  Multi.  Thank you.  Right. 
[00:14:30]  Thank you.  When you're a multi-millionaire, that's like fun because you could dress really well,  but you're choosing not to.  This is one of my better outfits today.  I mean, you don't look...  A little collared, short-sleeved shirt.  But when you're a schlub...  That's about five years old.  Oh.  Very worn jeans.  It's fun to dress like a schlub and know that you could buy and sell people who call you  a schlub.  Ah.  But when you're actually a schlub and people are like, you look like a schlub, you just  feel bad.  Are you dressing for success? 
[00:15:00]  I mean...  Did you read some book or something?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  And that button is like very awkward.  What?  It's buttoned up to the second button up.  Yeah, man.  It just looks awkward.  And then the collar's buttoned down.  The top button is not buttoned.  Did Mommy buy you that shirt?  No.  I bought this shirt when I bought these pants.  Did your sweetie buy you that shirt?  I purchased it myself.  Are those different pants from yesterday?  Yes.  You know, you used to be young Sam. 
[00:15:30]  I made the same mistake once when I was young Opie.  Oh.  I was working at CMF in Rochester.  And I was kind of like you.  I was all over the place.  I didn't have an official gig.  I did a little of everything.  And I decided to dress for success.  And I came in with a tie.  Oh.  I like that.  And slacks.  Nice.  And dress shoes.  I'm not sure if I went all in and had the suit jacket.  And Brother Weez looked at me and said, what the fuck are you doing?  Don't ever come to work like that again. 
[00:16:00]  Yep.  He goes, you're going to be doing a radio show.  You're not doing any of that other shit.  So you don't have to dress like that.  You should put the rule down on fucking Sam then.  Well, I'm not trying to get a position in management.  I'm dressing better than management.  You're dressed like Casual Friday.  Do you want to be known as a Casual Friday guy?  Oh, God.  Where it's very thought out, even though it's supposed to be Casual Friday.  But these jack-offs in management, they actually go to these stores to pick out their Casual 
[00:16:30]  Friday outfits.  Yeah, yeah.  Casual Friday means you just go, I don't know, jeans.  Open up a drawer.  Fuck, I like Springsteen, so I'll throw this Springsteen shirt on.  I don't know.  Casual Friday means your sweatpants are sagging and your pubic hair is showing.  Yes.  More of that than going to a store and picking out your Casual Friday outfit.  Where you have your boat shoes.  I've got to wear my boat shoes.  Maybe some chinos.  Chinos.  You'll see these idiots walking around.  I know, believe it.  I know, it's Casual Friday.  We're letting our hair down today. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, but none of them know how to dress.  They all look like idiots.  Like office space.  Right.  I dress well.  I have style to what I'm wearing, so it's a different deal.  So this is a new thing?  It's not something you're trying out?  Well, I can't confirm that it's going to, you know, it's a thing today and yesterday.  No, it's a thing.  It's a thing.  I mean, I like it.  Now it's a thing.  It's a thing.  No, you don't.  I do.  That isn't as comfortable as just t-shirt and fucking loose jeans and stuff.  You got your belt, dude.  You got your shirt. 
[00:17:30]  It's well thought out.  It's tucked in.  It's too thought out.  Yeah.  It's definitely thought out.  It's too thought out.  It's 100% thought out.  What about your, let's see your shoes.  Sperry's.  Sperry's.  Well, who wears those?  I don't know.  I mean, but don't talk to me like who wears those.  Like you guys are up on like who's wearing what right now.  Yeah, but I don't want to be up on that shit.  Sam always pulls out that card, by the way.  He always pulls out the we're so out of touch.  We don't know what the kids are doing these days.  Meanwhile, he's fucking 40 years old. 
[00:18:00]  And I had those shoes.  29 still.  Those shoes are just coming back around.  Right.  Yeah.  Because I remember having to wear those like a long time ago.  I got a pair of my closet.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  All right.  You're overthinking it.  And I just smelled the shirt and was hoping that it didn't smell too bad before it put it on.  What's the verdict?  It's not bad.  Okay.  Not bad.  A little pit stains, but I.  My whole getup, of course, is the various law enforcement shirts I get sent by friends around the country. 
[00:18:30]  Today, it's the Border Patrol.  The sad part is we can learn from him.  You probably should dress a little better.  Do you know that like.  You probably should.  All the conspiracy theories during the Boston bombing, when they had pictures of people,  they were like, look at the outfits that those guys are wearing.  So wish you were there that day.  They're obvious.  That's a horrible thing to say.  It was a terrorist attack.  Oh, man.  Obviously.  What?  To report for our radio show.  Oh.  You're sick.  And then get blown up.  But everybody goes, they're obviously.  You're sick.  I thought you would get some good audio and we'd have some exclusives. 
[00:19:00]  They're obviously undercover cops.  They're wearing tactical gear.  They're wearing an outfit that Anthony would wear.  Yes.  It's just what I would wear.  Right.  Exactly.  There's nothing wrong with it, but it's, you know.  Anyway.  So you're saying I'm going to get accused of being a terrorist someday?  No.  An undercover cop.  Oh, okay.  That is responsible for inside jobs.  Oh, well.  We might be accused of being radio hosts someday. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, but you're wild.  Get it?  Get it?  Get it?  Get it?  I'd rather hear one hour of power than 20 hours a week of you guys.  I want to say hi to the Howard Stern fans that have been tuning us in.  They don't really want to like us, but they want live programming. 
[00:20:00]  And a bunch of the people that said that we spoke the truth yesterday and that we did not actually attack.  Like, we only attacked his work ethic.  Like, people actually understood what we were saying yesterday.  I want to say hi to those people today.  We weren't saying anything that you can't disagree with.  And we're here.  I mean, we're not going to force you to like us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  What happened?  We're here.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  What happened?  It's been stuck in my head. 
[00:20:30]  What happened?  We're not going to force you to like us or anything.  We know you're there.  And you're like, oh, fuck.  Man.  Don't want to like them, but fuck.  That last line was kind of funny.  All right.  So, Anastasia Ashley, the surfer girl.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Her face sucks.  It ruins everything.  She's not bad.  But, man, she knows how to move her ass.  You know what?  That picture's not bad.  But their model, you know, their modeling pictures.  Yeah.  Anyone could look good if you get some modeling pictures going. 
[00:21:00]  They know how to gussy that shit up and make you look good.  Well, it's not bad either.  She's too skinny.  Hey, my name is Mars.  She's too skinny.  Stupid Mars.  Stupid Mars.  Hey, Vato.  She's too skinny.  But you notice he didn't look.  He looked quickly like, ah, too skinny.  And then just walked out.  Who does that?  It's a.  We deal with those big, huge, over-the-top bubble butts all the time that you try to turn 
[00:21:30]  us on to.  Stinky.  What up?  Yay.  Stinky's walking in the hallway.  Mars.  Here he comes.  Hey, that girl's too skinny, man.  All right.  Little did you know that I've seen that video about 12 times.  Oh, I am?  Looking you on top of things.  Of course.  Am I a little behind on this video, Mars?  A little bit.  Am I behind on that one?  Just a little bit.  All right.  Damn.  Show us an ass that you like, Mars.  Oh, God.  Let's try to relate to each other.  Oh, man.  A very white man and a very Hispanic man. 
[00:22:00]  Let's see if we can come to some kind of.  Jessica Biel.  Jessica Biel.  Oh, I see you went safe.  I want you to go animal.  I want you to go animal.  Like fucking.  What you've done in the past.  We're not even going to look at Jessica Biel.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, go to that one.  Go up, up, up.  Straight up.  Over.  Over.  There.  Let me see that one.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's stupid.  That's just so stupid.  No, it's great.  But that's an easy one.  That is easy.  Go with an animal one. 
[00:22:30]  Sophie Turner.  Animal meaning just over the top.  Animal.  Well, he's done this before.  Who's this?  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  Who's that?  Sophie Turner.  Sophie Turner, an Australian model.  She's Australian.  But you're going white.  All right.  I see you.  That's all I go.  No, you've gone really crazy bubble butts in the past.  You like that, Mars?  It's nice.  That's nice.  What's her name?  People need to see her. 
[00:23:00]  Sophie Turner.  Sophie Turner.  Sophie Turner.  Sophie Turner.  Mars is smart.  He knows his audience in this room.  He does.  So he picks the white girls with the nice asses.  But at home, you know what he's trolling.  He's trolling through some fucking Zimbabwe pictures and shit.  How badly do you think a shark wants to bite that Australian ass?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She went into the water.  We saw a shark.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  She does have a bubble butt. 
[00:23:30]  No.  The one.  Nope.  Yeah.  That one.  Her fucking.  Wait a minute.  Her fucking bikini bottom can't even contain the ass.  No.  It's like, oh, my God.  Could you give me a little more material?  Oh, I need.  I can't cover this.  Excuse me.  Amazing ass of yours.  I just need a little more material.  We just need a little more material back here.  Where?  Where do you need?  On my ass.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  What is this?  The selfie is the greatest invention ever.  She's in the bathroom mirror. 
[00:24:00]  I want to be in the book of quotes.  Yeah.  The selfie picture is the greatest invention ever.  Let's get this done.  I know there's a book of quotes out there somewhere.  No one ever used to do that with a Polaroid or a Kodak Instamatic.  No.  No one went into the bathroom with a fucking Instamatic camera with a flash cube.  Right.  And went funk in the fucking mirror.  All of a sudden, with the advent of the camera phone, the selfie is this viable fucking photo artwork now. 
[00:24:30]  That's pretty much how you say hello.  It's a how do you do, ain't it?  Right.  A fine how do you do.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yes.  And then Anthony also tweeted a fine video.  When did you tweet that?  That was a couple of days ago.  A couple days ago.  Oh, my God.  It's the funniest fucking thing ever.  Can we put this on our Facebook page, too, EROC?  Oh, yeah.  O.P. and Anthony on Facebook?  Please like our page so we look like fucking rock stars.  Thank you.  Apparently, some chick fucking spread some canola oil on the kitchen floor. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  And then calls in what appears to be maybe a younger sister or a brother or something.  Or is that the mom, too?  Could that be a mom?  I don't think it's a mom pulling that shit.  I don't think it's a mom pulling that shit.  Yeah, that'd be crazy, right?  It looks like an older sister, maybe, or something.  Who the fuck would do this?  Or a babysitter, even, maybe.  Who knows?  You could break your fucking neck.  Oh, it's not thought out.  No.  And the canola oil spread on the floor.  And then she yells for this.  Sounds like Macaulay or something. 
[00:25:30]  Come on in.  Get y'all juice.  And the kid runs in and slides on the canola oil and smashes into the stove, the oven door,  and just busts the fucking thing out.  It just shatters.  And the more you watch it, the funnier it gets.  You just watch it over and over, you know, the old vine loop.  And it's fucking great.  Yeah.  Oh, Sam.  Cam and Colin, run in here and come get y'all juice. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Macaulay.  Hey, Macaulay, run in here and come get y'all juice.  Run in here and come get y'all juice.  And the kid smashes right into the oven.  Hey, Macaulay, run in here and come get y'all juice.  Hey, Macaulay, run in here and come get y'all juice.  That's her taking out the stove.  Yeah.  Hey, Macaulay, run in here and come get y'all juice.  You fucking dummy.  Just not thought out.  No, not at all. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  The knee goes right into the fucking oven door.  She's fucking, she's doing fucking skiing like pizza.  Right.  Look at the feet.  Pizza, pizza slice.  And that ain't helping.  No, right into the, right into the stove.  Shattering the bottom of it.  Shattering the whole fucking floor or whatever.  Shattering the glass.  It's great.  Great video.  So that's on our Facebook page as well, right?  Yeah.  Arg.  Yeah, that's a good one.  So I was being a big time pussy about getting a root canal yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  You were, uh, I would say baby, baby, stick your head in gravy, wash off with bubble gum, and  then ship it off to some branch of the military, perhaps.  Absolutely.  Uh, where they can utilize it in future warfare.  That's right.  Yeah.  I, um, I, I don't, it's funny cause I, I said I don't like the dentist and I don't, and I,  I, I say a lot, uh, I don't like, um, dentist pain.  Yeah.  And then you realize when you just talk about this shit among your people around you, it's, 
[00:27:30]  everyone is pretty much the same.  Everyone.  So when you go to the dentist and say, look, I don't like pain and I don't do well with  it.  They've heard it a million fucking times.  No one really likes the pain.  I'm sure there's a few people out there that do and they're weird, but for the most part,  no, no one likes dent.  We all want to just fucking be numbed, numbed down, numbed up.  You do hear every once in a while from somebody that goes, Oh man, I get my cavities filled  without Novocaine.  I'm like, yeah, what is that?  Well, good for you.  Stop it.  It's probably one of these things where they, the, the dentist goes, look, you have the smallest, 
[00:28:00]  tiniest beginning of a cavity on the surface.  We could just zip, zip, zip it away.  Right.  But if they're drilling deep, if they're doing some deep sea fucking drilling in your tooth,  there's no way you could do it without Novocaine.  No.  I defy you.  When we, uh, have to do stuff in our personal lives, I, I always get excited because I'm  like, okay, I know we'll be able to make some kind of radio out of this.  Yeah.  I don't really have a big fucking story about my root canal. 
[00:28:30]  Just went, uh, swimmingly, huh?  It went amazingly well.  And the place I went, which was recommended by my dentist, Dr. Rockstar.  Dr. Rockstar.  Well, he doesn't have the, uh, he doesn't have the, the T in there, but we still call him  Rockstar, Dr. Rockstar, but I just sounds like an alien without the T.  I say, I am Rockstar.  So he goes, look, I don't do root, this type of root canal over here.  Cause it's way in the back.  So I'm sending you to a place. 
[00:29:00]  Uh, I've been sending people there for 12 years.  You're in good hands.  I go over there, I go in and you know, the paperwork we just bitched about recently on  the show.  Ponderous.  Anytime you go to the doctor or the dentist, you sit there and they hand you that clipboard  and the pen.  Right.  And you got to sit down with it awkwardly on your lap with two fucking people next to  you that you don't know what they got and start filling shit out that you don't know.  I don't know what my carrier number fucking group shit is. 
[00:29:30]  I'm looking up addresses on my phone.  I have to dig out my cards.  Where do you work?  I just put, oh, Sirius XM somewhere in New York City.  Oh, you do write that?  Ah, that's it.  What are they going to do?  What are they visiting?  What is my dentist got a fucking?  Yeah.  Oh, Anthony, your dentist is downstairs.  No.  What do they need to know my address here?  What did you, uh, were you the one that said that you come up with a car that they just  scan real fast and the info goes flying right into their computer? 
[00:30:00]  A car.  That is the smartest thing ever.  Or just something on your iPhone that you can put, pop up, and they scan that.  Here's my info.  There's all your info.  Here's my insurance stuff.  There it is.  Here's where I work.  It's 2013.  Here's my contact numbers.  Come on, people.  This is what I'm allergic to.  Right.  All that shit.  Oh, E-Rock's showing a card here.  What's that?  The Buy 10 Subway, get one free?  What?  Oh.  No, what is that, E?  Health insurance card and the, uh, I think the dental may have it, too. 
[00:30:30]  It has that thing on the back where they just scan it.  Barcode.  Yeah, but they don't...  Yeah, but does it have all your info?  Yeah.  So you don't have to, you don't have to fill out paperwork?  Only if you're the, uh, if you're a new patient to that doctor.  Well, that's just it.  But we're all new patients.  That's just it.  You said this was all your regular, uh, dentist.  No, no, no.  No.  Like, every time I go now, I don't have to do it again.  Yeah, of course not.  But it's when you first show up.  No, it's when you have to go out.  It's ponderous.  It's when you have to go elsewhere.  Yeah, they refer you.  They go, okay.  Everyone has to go elsewhere for something.  Your dentist goes, now you gotta go to the root canal guy. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  You go to the root canal guy, and you go through the whole fucking rigmarole again.  I'm not talking about your primary doctor.  Of course you don't have to fill out shit every time you go there, but there's always  some dumb thing.  Well, we want to make sure.  It's all waivers.  They love it.  They're like, is your insurance information still up to date?  They don't want to miss out on that shit.  With me, I have a bad shoulder, so I had to go to a shoulder guy, and then I had to  go to an MRI place, and then I had to go back, and every step of the way, it was  filling out paperwork again.  That's what we're getting at, E-Rod.  Yeah.  Yeah, so there should just be something that you just hand them, and they have your fucking 
[00:31:30]  info on there.  Like I said, paper, it's 2013.  Stop.  And we're all in agreement, because then the people at the office, they have to now pop  all that shit into their computer.  So they don't want to do that either.  So if everyone could just scan away, it'd be much easier.  Those stupid fucking giant file cabinets they got behind them, with the little red tabs  and blue and green, and they're pulling shit out.  Why the fuck are we doing that?  But you shouldn't be in those places.  That's when you know you're in a bad place. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If they're still using files, you're like, okay, maybe.  Oh, boy.  If you don't feel like updating your shit, doctor's like, I don't need that new fangled  stuff.  Right.  He's fucking putting leeches on you.  Right.  But the root canal place go in, small office.  They go fill out these two pages, which quite honestly wasn't that bad.  And because me and you don't have dental insurance, because me and Nan are an alternative couple,  so we know a lot about each other.  He has the same shit I have. 
[00:32:30]  We don't have dental.  And it was told to me that, oh, you don't need dental.  In the end, it's better to just pay out of pocket.  Out of pocket.  Really, Bob Eatman?  You want to pay my $1,900 bill from yesterday for one lousy fucking tooth?  Mine was $23 the other day.  So what do you mean we don't need dental?  Yeah.  Could have bought a lot of nice clothes for that money.  I could have fucking played a hand of blackjack.  A hand.  A hand.  Well, half a hand, really.  Half a hand is true. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, that is.  That is.  Without any splitting or doubling down.  Yeah, you're not really a lot of hit.  A straight fucking hand.  You're not a lot of hit.  No double down there.  Nothing.  You can't hit.  Can't split.  Yep.  So go in.  Two pages.  I go, look, I don't have insurance.  And I go, oh.  And then I go, well, I didn't fill this part out either.  They go, ah.  And I go, oh.  They didn't care is what I'm getting at.  I'm like, great.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  So then I'm like, well, how much longer?  Because we're all used to the fucking, even though your appointment, mine was at 1245. 
[00:33:30]  I'm assuming they might get to me by two o'clock.  So I hand in my paperwork.  I'm like, how much longer?  Like, just dreading what they were going to say.  They're like, oh, we should be getting to you momentarily.  Momentarily?  Like, sure you are.  Because, you know, you hear that shit, too.  Momentarily is vague, by the way.  I know.  Could be anything.  And I was thinking that.  So I sat down on their really nice leather couch in their waiting room.  I threw on a little candy crush.  Oh.  And I couldn't even play.  I couldn't even play. 
[00:34:00]  Because they said, Mr. Hughes.  What?  I'm like, that's exactly what I said.  I said, what?  I've only been here 10 minutes.  Right.  Barely 10 minutes.  Wow, that rules.  Sat down, and then this guy knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A gorgeous dental assistant.  Could easily be a model.  What was his name?  Dark hair.  Oh.  Just crystal blue eyes.  With a little of that European kind of accent, where it could have been out of nowhere. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  Maybe a little Russian.  Maybe a little...  Not from here.  Right.  Yeah.  Beyond nice.  That's why I knew she wasn't from here.  Yeah.  I knew she wasn't a fellow New Yorker.  Born and raised.  A lot of Russian.  A lot of, like, Eastern Bloc ladies in the dental industry.  Really?  Yeah.  Mine is, too.  She's pure Russian.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not good.  No, it's pretty good.  No, she's very good.  Because Russians, I think they can handle pain a little more.  You don't complain. 
[00:35:00]  Exactly.  America is very soft.  Exactly.  You need to take some pain.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  And deep in their DNA, they know what we did to them.  Oh, man.  We had our problems over the years, so...  We had some problems.  If he's got a fucking drill in his hands, he might make...  Go just slightly deeper.  Oh, man.  Or, you know, give you the Novocaine, but start just a little early.  A little too soon.  It's a little early.  You're numbed up good enough.  No, I still feel... 
[00:35:30]  No, you're good enough.  I don't think I'm good enough.  Ow!  See, I could do fucking impressions.  Mr. Gorbachev.  Drill that tooth.  Right.  What?  So then I sit down, and she's beautiful, and the lady behind the desk had cleavage for  days.  Whoa.  Dude, like, I was basically just staring at a topless woman.  And I'm like, this guy knows what he's doing.  This is all happy time. 
[00:36:00]  That's just fucking...  It's ladies' night at the dentist.  And she's way lower, so I'm looking...  I can't...  You know...  I had free glances without having to make believe I wasn't glancing, because I'm looking  down like, well, here's my paperwork.  If you were going out to the dentist on Long Island, I would assume you went to my dentist.  This is...  All the shit you're saying is like...  So they know what they're doing.  I think this is just what they know how to do.  Receptionist was a little older, maybe early 40s. 
[00:36:30]  Really nice breasts.  Breasts.  It's very hard to pluralize breasts.  It's like...  But when you say tits, it's so...  Tits.  Yeah.  It's so crass.  Really nice breasts.  I try to class it up a little bit.  It's the STS thing.  Actually, hers were knockers.  Knockers?  Yeah, knockers are big ones.  Oh.  Knockers.  She had knockers.  And her whole shirt...  Hangers?  Her whole blouse was just wide open. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  This is unbelievable.  Gee.  With the flirting with the bra thing, too, on the sides.  I'm just like, where am I?  Were you drooling at the counter?  Did they have to put the sucker thing in when you're talking to the receptionist?  I was drooling.  And I'm like, yeah, it started on me up, and she had to go, well,  oh, we haven't known you up yet.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm just drooling over your tits.  Oh.  So then I sat down, and then the guy comes in, and he's like, he's basically the same voice  from Despicable Me.  That...  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  How do you do the Steve Carell from Despicable Me?  Yeah.  I don't...  And then he goes, we're going to do the cold test, and I don't know.  I guess they put, like, a frozen metal object right on your tooth.  Wow.  Or this metal thing, obviously, in the freezer forever.  If that doesn't go well, it's got to hurt.  That was the only pain I felt the entire time I was there.  It hurt?  Yeah.  Not bad, but enough to go, yeah.  And he goes, yeah, this tooth is dying.  Your tooth, it's dying. 
[00:38:00]  He goes, it's dying.  Your fire.  And then they did the root canal.  I was back on the street an hour later.  I'm like, what the fuck just happened?  I'm like, what's happening?  Dude, everything takes forever.  Yeah, that's pretty fast, though.  I think an hour from the time you sat down starting paperwork to now you're on the street  going, what the fuck?  Yeah.  That's pretty damn good.  I'll take that every time.  And I didn't feel any pain, man.  I wish I had a story.  You know what came?  Not yet.  Well, they know what came the shit out of you. 
[00:38:30]  I've never been that numb in my life.  Half your head?  Oh, yeah.  All the way up to, like, here?  Yeah.  You go to scratch your cheek or something.  You're like, ah, it's numb up there, too.  It was just under my eye.  I was numb.  What?  My left nostril was numb.  My neck where I'm like, oh, my God, I don't know if I could swallow anymore.  Yeah, that's so weird.  They hit the palate, too.  Oh, I hate that.  You hear a crunch.  Yeah, but I didn't.  He said, I'll feel a little pinch.  I barely felt that, too.  Yeah.  And I have felt way more pain just getting a dumb cavity filled than the root canal. 
[00:39:00]  I felt nothing.  You think in this day and age they could do away with the needle, too?  Do some of that fucking Bones McCoy shit where they just wave something.  And it's like, oh, I'm numb.  That fucking salt shaker.  Right.  Yeah.  And then, you know, they were ready to give me the vitamin V. I said, I don't need the vitamin V.  Oh, man.  What, you take the vitamin V every time?  No, they never offered it to me.  Oh, no.  Oh, they were ready to give me some Vicodin. 
[00:39:30]  Damn.  I would take that.  Why not?  I'm not a pill guy.  Then do you need, like, somebody to drive you home?  Is that, like, the thing, too?  Like, if they give you that, it's like they won't let you leave unless somebody's there to drive you.  Oh, no.  This was a prescription for the shit.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, not right there in the office.  I thought right there in the office.  And I asked them, like, what kind of pain?  They're like, eh, you should be all right, but you might feel it a little bit for two days.  I don't feel anything.  That's what they told me.  I took it.  Same thing with mine.  I took some ibuprofen yesterday just to stay ahead of it, as they say, but I didn't even 
[00:40:00]  take any this morning.  I'm totally fine.  Yesterday, I was slamming this fucking tooth, chewing an ice cream sandwich with that side.  Sensitivity, schminsitivity.  Yeah, but ice cream sandwich, that's easy.  Well, the ice cream part is a little cold.  I was fucking chewing jawbreakers on that side.  I had beef jerky.  I had caramel.  I was eating cinder blocks.  I was chewing on lock washers. 
[00:40:30]  I think I want to send them something.  They were so good.  Wow.  Send them one of the gifts that you got from fucking...  Paul Anka?  Paul Anka.  Oh, not a bad idea.  Or me.  Or Iraq.  Oh, shit.  What, you're still holding a grudge, really?  Years later?  Sure is.  See if they want an Islanders poster.  Oh, poster.  It is a poster.  It's a poster.  It's a nice poster.  Righty?  Do you remember it?  Oh, boy.  Sort of.  Wherever it is now.  No, it's in my brother's house.  Sure.  He took it out of the garage finally.  Is that a garage sale somewhere?  He's holding it for you. 
[00:41:00]  He is.  Yeah.  You know, maybe I could put it in the beach house, but I don't own the beach house.  I don't know.  Inadvertently forget to get it when you leave the beach house.  Advertently.  Advertently.  And the only other thing, I decided to walk a little bit, because I love walking around  New York City, especially when I'm in a different area, and I try to walk home from  wherever I'm at.  You just feel like everyone's staring at you.  I felt like my whole face was blown out, because I can't feel anything.  Yeah.  So, to me, you know, you feel like there's something going on. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I just felt like everyone was looking at me.  I felt like...  You do feel like half a Hulk face.  I felt like, I don't know, I was either blown out, or like you got a bully ball on the side  of your head.  Oh, you're drooling.  Head now, or...  Boo.  Yeah, and then I made sure I didn't bring my teeth together for about three hours.  You didn't want to bite your tongue?  I didn't want to scrape...  Yeah, I didn't want to bite out the sides or any of that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, well, and I have to go in like two weeks, I gotta go back, and they're gonna do another 
[00:42:00]  tooth and stuff, and I absolutely...  I want to do Novocaine karaoke, because you know how you can't really talk and stuff?  I think it'd be great to just try to do a song with your whole fucking...  It'd be great with your whole fucking mouth numb.  Maybe I could tell the dentist, you know, really shoot me up here before I leave, so it's  really goofy.  Is she cool enough?  Yeah, she's pretty cool.  Then fucking give her your phone and just do like a quick little thing while you're in  the chair.  I'd like to do karaoke, though, the whole thing.  That's what I mean.  You could do a little, uh...  I don't know, I'd need background music. 
[00:42:30]  Well, how are you gonna do that?  By the time you get home, you're...  No, that shit lasts pretty long, and I'm literally three minutes away from my dentist.  Then do it.  Have the karaoke all set up, and you run right home and do it.  That's pretty funny.  Didn't we want to do that on the show once?  We did, but I guess management said no.  We were not allowed to...  Remember that?  We wanted to do Novocaine karaoke?  Novocaine.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we did.  Oh, yeah.  Get a dentist and do it, and...  Yeah, a dentist could come in and shoot him. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, no.  Well, that's a problem.  Right.  With our liability and the lawyers.  So, that's it.  Well, I'm glad it was painless.  Yeah.  Isn't that nice?  Well, I guess it's painless, because they take the nerve right out, right?  Yeah, they yank that fuck around.  I want to see it.  How big is a nerve?  I don't know.  It's got to be a little, like, a fucking string.  Like a tooth nerve.  I think it looks like a piece of fucking, like, dental floss.  Like a little fucking wet string thing.  Could you see it? 
[00:43:30]  Probably.  But it's very tiny, I would assume.  Yeah.  Seinfeldwick Kramer goes to the dentist, and they think he's retarded.  He's wearing those big, dumb shoes.  Jimmy shoes.  He's talking like that.  I'm going to give you some Novocaine.  Oh, I'm lord.  So, what about the penthouse?  Did you ask him?  Well, he said that, you know, it helps his patients relax a little bit.  And he's got a new policy.  Adults only.  Adults only.  It's hard. 
[00:44:00]  Velvet Fogg thinks he's retarded for a benefit.  Well, Michael Richards had to do that.  Do you think they actually found someone that might have been able to give him a little  Novocaine?  I mean, I know he's drooping his mouth and all that, so he's playing it up.  But do you think just to help out the impression that maybe he got a little bit?  He was usually pretty good with, like, method acting.  Right.  Like, in the scene where they're in the parking garage, and he's carrying an air conditioner 
[00:44:30]  in a box.  Oh, right, right.  He really had an air conditioner in the box.  Oh, no kidding.  Because he wanted it to look like he was carrying something heavy.  And then when he goes to put it in the trunk, it smashes against the trunk lid, and his face  hits the box, and he cut his fucking nose open on it.  I remember that.  So he did like to, if he could do it, to actually do it.  So I don't know, perhaps.  But he's always good with that slapstick shit and a little ad-libbing.  I liked his ad-libbing at the comedy store.  Where was that?  The Laugh... 
[00:45:00]  It was Jamie's place.  The Laugh Factory?  Which one is it again?  I think it was The Laugh Factory.  The Laugh Factory.  Did you ever see his improv there one night?  No.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Really?  What was it about?  Well, I guess he was working the crowd, doing a little crowd work.  Yeah.  Just short of the German Shepherds and Fire Hoses, apparently, but a little crowd work.  Boy, he'll never, ever live that down.  Nope.  And he's been shunned.  Like, the only thing I've seen him on since that was the Larry David reunion show. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know what Jason Alexander's trying to pull off, but have you seen him?  Did you see...  He was on...  I don't know if you've seen this show.  It's terrible.  This new NBC show, Hollywood Game Night.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Oh, I've seen that.  Terrible.  It's horrible.  Awful.  But he was on that.  That's with Jane Lynch, right?  Yes.  I saw it once.  She's not a good host.  It was unbelievable how bad that is.  What are they trying to do?  Like a win, lose, or draw thing, like from years ago?  I don't know.  Like Burt Reynolds used to get together.  But they're doing a whole bunch of different games. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, kind of, though.  Right.  They have a bunch of party games, basically.  Yeah.  They're making believe they're all just having a little party.  Exactly.  They're all drinking and casual.  All, again, Travis knows everything.  Did you see it last night?  No.  I only saw the first episode, and I tapped out.  I couldn't...  I'm like, this thing is horrendous.  Wait till you see what Jason Alexander looked like on that episode.  I guess...  Michael Richards, by the way, did Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, he did.  Last season, and it's very good.  Yeah?  You should watch it.  Which one?  I will watch it.  I like that show. 
[00:46:30]  He did Jerry's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online.  I saw the Gervais one.  It's great, too.  I saw Ricky Gervais.  I want to see...  He was petrified.  I want to see the Don Rickles one.  He did, too.  Oh, my God.  It's the episode of Seinfeld where he gets the wig.  All right, so that's Al Roker.  Al Roker.  Josh Gad.  I just said yesterday that Josh Gad looks like Jason Alexander a little bit.  Why does Jason Alexander have now a full head of hair?  I remember I read a tweet from him a while back where he said, look, I'm getting a system, 
[00:47:00]  a hair system in place where it's not a full head of hair.  I'm still going to look balding, he says, but it's just a little.  It's for parts because they usually give me one when I do a part on a movie.  It's for auditions.  Now he's stepping up and getting more hair.  But they just don't have the sides figured out.  No, you can see where that...  I don't know why they can't figure out the sides.  You can see where his regular hair meets the wig.  There's no blending.  You can't be as famous as George Costanza and then get hair. 
[00:47:30]  And then get hair.  You can't.  I was bald.  Elaine should rip it off his head and throw it out the window.  I don't like this thing.  I was bald.  Elaine, when she grabs for it, the way he recoils, it's perfect.  She's great in that scene.  Oh, my God.  He smiles like our accountant.  Oh, God, he does.  Jason Alexander, that's too much of a sudden.  Yeah, he really does.  I wouldn't want a photo with this guy.  No.  They referenced it on the show, but there was no suitable explanation as to why it was happening. 
[00:48:00]  Does it look real?  No, it looks very uncomfortable, especially because you know what he looks like.  It doesn't look real, and you know he's a bald guy already because he's on the most famous sitcom of all time.  Yes, and many of the jokes on that show are about his bald guy.  If it looks good, who cares that we know him as a bald guy?  Good for you.  Oh, man.  So it just doesn't look...  Check.  It doesn't, but it doesn't look good.  But there's so much money to be made if they could figure that shit out for real.  Looks like George is wearing a wig.  Like, what ain't got done, and you can't tell whatsoever, but these guys that are really 
[00:48:30]  bald and they're trying to get something back, they just can't figure it out still.  Well, it's different when you're fucking horseshoe bald, or you're just thinning a bit and want  to add some follicles.  There's no cure for fucking pure bald.  They don't have it.  One of these companies get real artists to try to figure it out for them.  Yeah, because it's always just that corner thing on the sides. 
[00:49:00]  It's like a perfect fucking corner.  It looks like those geographical snapshots of the border between the U.S. and Mexico.  You know, it's like, ah, the green, lush United States.  Oh, what's on the other side of that?  They just can't make it look like it's...  And then they can't blend it still?  No.  I don't know.  You would think we'd have that figured out, at least.  You'd think.  I've accepted no flying cars in our lifetime, but, I mean, let's figure out, you know, the  fake hair thing. 
[00:49:30]  Right?  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Okay, we did absolutely nothing this first hour, but it was fun.  But it was fun.  But it was fun.  Very fun.  Nothing.  You did Working for the Weekend.  You looked at some YouTube videos.  Oh, remember that?  Opie went to the dentist, and Jason Alexander's wearing a wig.  Are you writing down what we talked about?  No, it's from memory.  Wow.  You wrote it down.  I always take notes.  The first...  For a book.  That's exactly right.  Oh, man.  Because this is gonna...  That first hour is making the book, my friends. 
[00:50:00]  Our second hour should be us recapping the first hour.  We could do that.  I got the notes.  Or could we redo the first hour?  Exactly.  And see where we...  And see where we could pump it up a little bit.  I really enjoyed when you guys did that a couple years ago.  We did?  Over at XM.  We tried to do the same...  What was it?  The same 15 minutes or 20 minutes?  Over and over and over again.  It was hysterical.  But it just got better and better, though.  It was very funny.  Yeah.  Why is it curly there?  It doesn't look that bad.  But then it's too high.  It's too high on its head. 
[00:50:30]  There's no hairline there.  It always looks like the whole hair system needs to be just pushed down slightly.  They always have it too high.  You're too far back.  You know what it needs?  It needs a brim so you can pull it down.  Right.  Exactly.  It's like a hat.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's not that bad, considering where he was at with his hair.  Yeah.  I've seen way worse, but...  Oh, boy.  It's him.  That's George.  That's George.  That's the George.  And everyone knows you like that, so...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Wow. 
[00:51:00]  That's a big difference.  You just gotta embrace it.  That's George.  That's Costanza.  Yeah.  The glasses, the fucking...  Yeah.  Not this guy with hair.  I don't know who that guy is.  Nah, I don't know who he is.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Did you ever see...  Wait, hold on.  Google Jason Alexander Criminal Minds.  That was one of my favoritest episodes ever.  Why?  Oh, he's...  Oh, that's right. 
[00:51:30]  We played that.  Yeah.  He's got the long mane of gray hair.  Right.  That's the wig he should have gotten.  Yeah.  That's the one he should walk around with.  He's hair like this all the time.  It's no less ridiculous than the one he's wearing.  This is the wig that George would get.  Yes.  That's the George wig.  Yeah.  Why are people trying to turn me on to the Lady Gaga video?  Because she's naked.  I can't get through the beginning of it.  Why?  She's laying on the floor going,  Ah!  And then there's some in the woods thing. 
[00:52:00]  Just get to the naked part.  It's amazing when somebody actually has musical talent  and they still need to go the Yoko Ono route.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  People thought we were making up the Yoko Ono stuff yesterday.  There's still people that have no idea about her and her screaming.  Her dumb screamy shit.  Her screamy shit.  Oh, is she terrible?  So what's up with Lady Gaga?  She's completely naked?  Lady Gaga.  Well, I guess a friend of hers is an artist.  Oh, yeah.  And so for, uh...  She's not fat anymore, right? 
[00:52:30]  No.  No.  Let me see some full frontal nudity of Lady Gaga.  You mean Stephanie?  What is she doing?  Oh, God.  Don't skip through it.  Let's watch the whole thing.  No!  What's that?  She just...  Hey.  Oh, boy.  She's got her arms up in the air.  Well, that's to make the tits less droopies.  Exactly.  All right.  You know what?  That's not bad.  Didn't she go out somewhere last week with, like, no makeup at all?  Did she?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Let's see.  She's dog-like.  She's not a good-looking woman.  I don't know.  Keep going.  Let's see more naked.  That's it.  Those are the two shots.  How come you're not playing, like, a moving picture naked?  What is this?  That's why I'm not lying.  Wow.  What's the...  She's...  I don't even know how to say the word.  Abram...  Abram...  Abramovic.  Abramovic?  What is that?  It's like a type of, I think, like, yoga. 
[00:53:30]  And this woman that she knows is starting a Kickstarter campaign.  Fucking yoga bear!  He's not supposed to be here.  I know.  I just have to.  Why?  It's a tribute.  It's an homage.  Oh, we take a break from that stuff.  Oh!  We take a break from that stuff.  Oh!  I loved when Jimmy said,  I'm sorry my character is destroying the show today.  It was funny.  He's with the gigolos today, right? 
[00:54:00]  That's right.  The gigolos.  There's a gathering of the gigolos.  Yes, the gathering of the gigolos.  Sam, you should have still went.  By myself?  The juggolos.  Why not?  I need somebody to help me with the equipment.  I need somebody...  But Kenny's there.  You would have hung out with them for a little bit.  And then they're leaving, I know.  But you should have just went.  No, we would have...  They would have gone later, so I would have...  And you couldn't find anyone else to go with around here?  Well, Iraq's busy, and what am I going to take?  What's Eric doing?  He's adding a wing to his house.  Yeah, Iraq is...  You're adding a wing?  ...to the Nagel mansion.  He's adding a third...  Or a fourth floor, actually. 
[00:54:30]  The Nagel compound is getting bigger.  Yes.  Wow, no kidding.  Iraq, you adding more shit to your house?  That I am.  Iraq, perhaps a nursery?  Is that what he's working on?  For himself, for his toys.  No.  Yes, for his toys.  It's a place he can go in and play with his toys.  It's a playroom for myself.  Eric had a tough day yesterday.  He broke out some old toys to play with.  Where I sleep, where my husband, Eric, plays with his toys.  What did he do yesterday?  Eric had a tough day. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  He said...  So he broke out some older toys.  He posted a thing that said he was feeling down, like he was sad.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  If I was Iraq, I'd be happy all the time.  All the time.  Absolutely.  But, uh...  So he was sad, and so he opened a box of old Ninja Turtles toys.  Oh, that made him happy.  Yeah.  I got it.  Opened a box of...  It's on his Twitter.  Like, it was sealed?  It was a closed box?  Yeah.  He keeps them in a little plastic bag.  It's his old toys from when he was a kid. 
[00:55:30]  And...  Oh, there you go.  You got your Bebop, your Rocksteady.  I have all of those still.  Now, E-Rock, when you open it up, do you stand him up and go pew, pew, pa, pew, ooh, ooh?  Do you play with them like that?  Those are not Ninja Turtle noises.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.  They didn't have guns.  What's going on?  He's playing with his toys.  But they're in bags.  Yeah.  You got to store it, because that's what you...  That's like his semen.  He doesn't want...  Do you ever pull them out of the bags?  I pulled these out yesterday. 
[00:56:00]  I haven't opened that box in, like, 20 years.  But, I mean, do you pull them out of the actual bags?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And what do you do with it?  Once it's out of the bag.  How much is that worth?  Do you make it walk?  Not much.  Not much.  Do you go, ah, ah...  You've been storing this for 20 years, and it's not even worth that much?  They've all been re-released so loose, they're not worth anything.  Yeah.  None of this stuff's worth anything, though, right?  No.  Toy collecting...  I mean, aside from a few things, it's not like...  Because everything's so mass-produced.  Right.  That's what happened with baseball cards.  The other day, Lil Riley was playing with the Smurfette. 
[00:56:30]  And she's on the picnic table, and she's going, like, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, walking.  And then she wanted it to take a plane ride.  So she had her planes, you know, the movie Planes, had a little plane, and Smurfette got  on top of the plane and was flying around.  So do you play with it like that, like a four-year-old?  I would if I had the...  Turtle van?  No, the Technodrome.  Nice.  If I had that, I would, but these are just on display.  Ah, okay. 
[00:57:00]  I have the Turtle Van if you want it.  I'll take it.  What is a Technodrome?  A Technodrome is where Krang lives.  Krang is, like, the arch-villain.  He's worse than Shredder, quite frankly.  No way, really?  It's a spaceship and a tank.  It came from Dimension X.  Wait, what do you mean?  Oh, it's a spaceship, it's a tank.  It's a building, it's a bug.  But it's a big, it's a big.  Yeah, but it's a big, it's a bug.  Technodrome.  Technodrome.  It's where Krang lives.  He's the arch-villain.  He's a brain.  Uh-huh.  Right.  But he's got a big robot body that he can live in, and he lives in the Technodrome from 
[00:57:30]  Dimension X.  Oh, boy.  And his whole mission is to create evil and to stop the Ninja Turtles, which were created  from mutagens.  Yes.  That was dripped into the sewer.  Right, the sewer.  Are you paying attention?  You've got to remember, Krang was a real person, but when they banished him from Dimension  X, they separated his brain from his body.  I can't hear you, Eric.  Are you paying attention?  Because you're like...  The phone's on. 
[00:58:00]  What are you saying?  Because Splinter got hit with the mutagen, too.  Thank you.  And then he met the Turtles and taught them the art of ninjitsu.  Oh, boy.  Obi and Shredder used to be a student of Splinter.  Obi.  Oh, Casey.  Oh, I mean, they met Casey Jones, but he's a person.  Uh-huh.  He wears a Jason hockey mask.  He's a sports enthusiast who also knows ninjitsu.  What about April O'Neil?  April O'Neil's a reporter who happens to have a weird sexual tension with the Turtles. 
[00:58:30]  Ew.  Michelangelo is a party dude.  Human?  Wait, is the reporter human?  Yeah, April O'Neil one.  Why would she have a sexual thing with Turtles?  It's just a weird sexual tension.  Are you going to be paying attention?  It's a little edgy.  To the game.  It's a weird...  She always comes down to their home in the sewers, brings pizza.  They love pizza because they're teenage mutant ninja turtles.  Teens love pizza. 
[00:59:00]  You know what?  Donatello does machines.  Uh-huh.  You know.  Do they have a leader?  Iraq plays with this?  That would be Splinter.  No, that's not.  No, Leonardo.  Do you play with it?  No, they're on display.  So what?  You take it out, display them, and then put them back?  No, no.  Display, they're in bags.  Yeah.  No, I took them out of the bag.  And then what did you do with that?  I put them up on a shelf.  And then what?  Damn it!  We were there to look at. 
[00:59:30]  Never going to get past that.  What happened?  That's rough.  We were just talking about the Turtles.  Oh.  Eric, where's Casey Jones?  So what's the Technodrome?  There's a second box I'm looking for that has the rest of them.  I can't find it.  I'm not going to answer the question again.  No, what's the Technodrome?  I told you already.  I feel like you might not have been paying attention.  And this is what you were doing yesterday, Iraq.  I decided to take them out.  Instead of helping to build the Nagel Mansion up?  Yeah.  I decided to take them out.  Why were you so sad?  Yeah.  I had a shitty day.  Why?  What happened, Iraq?  Come on.  Open up for us. 
[01:00:00]  First, I was having car problems.  Right.  Oh, no.  What?  Was there a twig in the way you couldn't get out?  What's going on with the music?  We're not talking about Ninja Turtles anymore.  He's not playing it.  He's not paying attention.  I'm paying attention.  Why did you have a bad day yesterday?  Yeah.  I had car problems, and then I broke a tooth.  That wasn't fun.  Jesus.  He didn't know how to tell us that one, did he?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Will and Frye never hurts anyone.  What's the start? 
[01:00:30]  What's the start?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's rock, paper, scissors for the start.  Iraq.  Oh, yeah.  That's too easy.  You broke a tooth.  Yeah.  And that makes a bad day?  Well, yeah.  I have a broken tooth.  Did you break it, or did a poacher take it?  Because it makes their dick harder.  Oh, eee.  An aphrodisiac.  What happened to your car?  As I was driving at the alternator, I just decided that it wasn't going to keep working anymore. 
[01:01:00]  It wasn't going to alternate.  And, yeah, it took several startups just to get the car home.  What were you eating when your tooth broke?  Tuna milk.  Tuna milk?  Tuna milk.  There's nothing really hard in there.  No, there wasn't.  That's what it was weird.  Well, Opie broke it on hummus, so.  Oh, that's the same tooth.  So, obviously, that dumb tooth has been dying for a while.  You might need a root canal.  You might be going down the same road I just went down.  Oh, they repaired it.  What?  I think he was excitedly chomping.  Same day dentist.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Excitedly chomping.  He just gets so excited.  Just fucking slamming teeth together.  What, they just glue it back in?  No, he doesn't mean they repaired it.  What does he mean?  Just the new teeth are coming in.  Shark-nado.  Yes.  Shark week.  There's some shark humor for you.  It's top of gold.  What?  But you were able to get right to the dentist, and they repaired it.  Well, it broke during the show yesterday, and I called, and I got a late afternoon appointment 
[01:02:00]  to come in.  What the hell's going on with everyone's teeth on this show?  Everyone's teeth are falling apart.  How much money did you get for the tooth?  How did they repair it so fast?  Yeah, what did they do?  I don't know.  He put some needle right on the tooth there.  I guess it's some kind of adhesive, and then they just rebuild the tooth right on top.  Wow.  And it was done within 20 minutes.  They take that little blue light and go, beep.  Oh, that blue light was just shooting out of my mouth in multiple spots. 
[01:02:30]  Fucking amazing.  Really?  It just hardens that shit right back up.  I'm stunned at the speed at which they do things at the dentist these days.  Even that stupid stuff that you had to make the impression, that you got to go,  I was like, oh, the gel in the metal.  Now it's like two seconds.  That's awesome.  She feels it.  She goes, okay, open.  Yeah.  See what I'm talking about?  Lady Gaga.  That's Lady Gaga.  Without makeup is horrendous.  Thanks, J underscore Giordano.  I don't know much about Lady Gaga. 
[01:03:00]  Holy fuck.  I'll retweet your shit.  Yeah?  Is that her without no makeups?  I'll retweet that shit.  E-Rock is like Alexander in the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.  Jesus.  Except instead of moving to Australia, he played with Ninja Turtles.  Yeah.  Right.  So you chipped a tooth.  You fucking, your car broke.  What else?  Everything was better with Ninja Turtles.  And that makes you play with Ninja Turtles?  That's correct.  Your wife's got to feel great that she's like, my husband had a bad day. 
[01:03:30]  So he went downstairs and played with his Ninja Turtles.  Yeah.  He runs to his toys for comfort.  For comfort.  Comfort.  Yes.  For comfort.  Instead of into the arms of a loving wife.  How do you play with your Ninja Turtles?  Do you lay on your belly and just kind of like...  He's on the floor with his feet kicking.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, Ninja Turtles.  Making them fight.  No.  There's some trouble we've got to take care of.  Let's go. 
[01:04:00]  Who's got the pizza?  Do you still have their original weapons?  Yep.  That's why they're in bags, to maintain their accessories.  How much is that worth?  Nothing.  Probably not much.  You've been hanging on to it for over 20 years.  So why do you keep them in bags?  Well, because at that point I was done, and I just threw them in bags and threw them  in a box.  To Iraq's credit, it's fun to collect them and have the accessories.  I got all my, like...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you do with them?  You just collect them and you have them.  You just put them on display.  Yeah.  So you put them on...  They're on display right now. 
[01:04:30]  They're on a shelf.  I don't understand collectors.  Jimmy's a collector, too, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's a hoarder.  He tells a story.  You know, he came to my house for one of my functions and a boxing glove that I've had signed  by a bunch of boxing greats.  Right, right.  That Jimmy actually bought the boxing glove for me and said, here, I got this for you.  I know you'd appreciate it.  And I did.  And I don't even know who signed it at this point.  It was a big one, though.  It was like Sugar Ray Leonard or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, my nephew had it on and he was just punching all of us.  Oh, no.  And Jimmy saw that and, I'm not even joking, was losing his mind. 
[01:05:00]  He couldn't wrap his head around the fact that the boxing glove that was signed by Sugar  Ray Leonard and others, my nephew was just wearing for the, you know, at the party and punching  people with.  Why would you do that?  Well, because in the end, what?  I know.  What are you going to do with it?  It's true.  I think, if I saw all these guys on display at Iraq's house, I'd actually think it was  cool, privately.  Privately, you'd be like, privately.  Privately, I'd be like, that's pretty sweet, dude.  Really?  Yeah.  I never understood that.  I like collecting.  It's fun.  A few things here and there, but nothing crazy. 
[01:05:30]  I like you guys.  I got a shelf full of wrestlers in my house.  Jewelry of murder victims, perhaps.  Bones.  Wow, that's something.  But then again, I appreciate a good sunset picture, so each their own.  Each their own.  I put the championship belts on the wrestler toys to match the real wrestlers, so.  It updates every week.  Yeah, that's just weird.  Wait, you actually update and move the championship?  Yeah, move the belts from guy to guy.  What are you going to do if you go on, like, vacation and the belt changes, and you know 
[01:06:00]  that there's a wrestler at your house?  Well, I'm already pissed because, like, the tag team champions now are new guys, so they  don't have toys yet.  So that's freaking you out.  They're just sitting there on the shelf.  Like, stupid belts.  Stupid belts.  Vacate.  Vacant.  Wow.  Championship is vacated.  It's terrible.  Do you do understand you have a very attractive wife?  She's banging.  All right.  She's banging?  Just thought maybe you forgot.  I thought you forgot.  No. 
[01:06:30]  She still gets it.  Because if you knew that, you wouldn't be, you know, playing with your toys.  I'm not playing.  Again, I'm like you.  With your wrestling toys.  It's display.  It's just the belts get moved.  Sure.  I have a feeling Eric plays with his toys more than you.  I think Eric does tend to play with his toys.  If he has a bad day, he breaks out those toys.  Those are just on display to look at.  I think maybe before they were on display, a couple of those turtles threw a couple of  karate kicks.  Right.  Exactly.  I think so.  Yeah.  I believe so. 
[01:07:00]  I think Rocksteady took one to the chin.  Do they have articulated joints?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Then you moved them around a little bit.  A little bit.  You moved the arms and legs around.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  They're posed.  Yeah.  You're like a serial killer.  I know.  I'm going to pose her.  I've got to pose my eyes.  That's a provocative position for the police.  You know, now I've got to go and pose real girls.  Oh, boy.  Those are just display.  There's other toys.  Yeah.  I don't doubt it. 
[01:07:30]  What is in the bags with them?  Like, I see this, like, white stuff in a bunch of them.  What is that?  Yeah.  What is that?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Maybe it's towels.  Maybe it's a little post-it that says what their name is.  Oh, no.  Semen?  Maybe it is.  Use condoms.  Oh, yeah.  We're still talking about action figures?  Yeah, but there's stuff in the bags.  We can't figure out what it is.  It looks like a piece of paper.  He probably wraps them.  No, it is a piece of paper because some of those characters, I figured, they weren't 
[01:08:00]  really that popular.  I figured I'd forget who they were.  You were going to forget Michelangelo's name?  No, I just wrote it.  So you jotted down the name and threw it in the bag with it.  He goes, tell me the truth.  When you found these toys, did you actually forget any of their names?  Well, yeah.  There's still a couple there.  I don't know.  All right.  That little bug thing on the right, which I never saw in the cartoon, really.  I had him.  I had...  And me and my brother had all these.  Ugh.  And the guy with the rats on the lower left.  Right.  My brother had him.  I had the robot guy.  These are all collecting dust in my dad's basement. 
[01:08:30]  Well, they should be.  Yeah.  In unorganized boxes.  You're a grown man, for the love of God.  If I had a pool to put him around, maybe it'd be all right.  Oh.  When's the pool going in at the Negro Mansion?  I don't have a property.  I need more property.  He's putting one.  He's building one upstairs, actually.  Ah, indoor, upstairs pool.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Nice.  Very cool.  Let's go eat.  Yeah.  Let's eat something.  All right.  I like that.  15 minutes, we're a complete waste of time.  I love it.  I think it's podcast material.  Really?  Podcast doing well?  Yes, it is. 
[01:09:00]  Our latest podcast is up?  Yes.  Episode 13, I think, we're up to already?  Wow, that's a quick 13 weeks, huh?  Man!  13?  13.  Yeah.  That's something.  That's a quarter.  That's crazy.  That's a quarter of the year.  Amazing.  I feel like we just started the podcast.  Quarter of a year ago.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  So, episode 13, you've got to remind me.  Episode 13 is good.  It's the Breaking Bad interviews.  Okay.  Suck Cock for K-Rock, which is a classic.  Okay.  And what's the nugget? 
[01:09:30]  Well, and then Master Poe's Evacuation Plan.  Oh, right.  Which is another classic.  Please don't give the nugget away again.  You want it to be a surprise.  I like the Opie and Ethic Nugget to be a surprise.  But you like people to know it's there.  Yes.  Oh, it's there, all right.  Wait for it.  Spend the hour listening to the podcast in anticipation of the nugget.  And then the Opie and Ethic Nugget drops out.  Correct.  At the end of the podcast.  Oh, it drops out.  So, go to iTunes.  Go to our Facebook page for the link.  I have to say it all the time. 
[01:10:00]  I use BeyondPod.  I think it's called BeyondPod because I don't have the iPhone.  And that works great for me.  Whatever.  Go get it, please.  And tell people we've got a podcast going.  Because I hear from people all the time that say,  look, I used to listen to you guys.  Yeah.  They either can't afford the satellite radio or choose not to get it.  I don't get it.  So, this is a way of getting our shit out there to those other people.  And maybe they turn around and they get the satellite. 
[01:10:30]  Who knows?  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  The Open Air 3 Show.  Continues in moments.  And now, these messages.  Series Connection.  Series XM.  The Open Air 3 Show.  Oh, I know what this one is.  I saw this in Travis's email last night.  Yes. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I saw this.  Jerry Garcia.  You don't like the dead.  I know.  We've done this many times.  I'm not a big fan.  No.  No.  You could do it again.  I like the dead.  I'm not hardcore, though.  I go a little past the hits.  That's it.  Not too deep.  Not too deep.  I liked that Touch of Grey song.  The dead fans are like, man, you don't even know.  I'll go with Shakedown Street. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Give me a little Shakedown Street.  Jerry Garcia died 18 years ago today at the age of 53.  He would have been, what, 71 if he was still around.  I remember that when we were, like, at AAF.  Like?  Yeah, that's about right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very early on.  I like this one.  Oh, no.  You know this one, Ant?  Not in the least.  This isn't that deep.  This is what I'm talking about.  I know the hits.  I've heard this.  And then they go slightly deep.  All right, I've heard this. 
[01:12:00]  Wasn't played on the radio a lot.  Sounds, like, funky.  Yes, it is.  A little more funky than I'm used to with the dead.  Oh, no.  Nothing?  No.  This, uh...  How long did this go on live?  Like, fucking 45 minutes?  Yeah, you know.  Sounds disco. 
[01:12:30]  Definitely.  Disco Jerry.  Is this a live version?  No.  The live version is 15 minutes and 32 seconds.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Grateful Dead.  15 minutes.  15 minutes.  For a song.  This doesn't sound like the studio track.  I haven't heard the song in a while.  Deadheads hate this song?  That's what I'm reading.  Probably.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm not saying, like...  Wow.  It's one of the ones I do like, though. 
[01:13:00]  Whamp, whamp, whamp.  It does sound a little fucking weird.  Like, they were going like,  Well, we gotta update our sound a little bit.  For the disco.  The disco days.  Yeah.  No, that's a different version of that song.  There you go.  I like Touch of Grey.  Ah, this was...  We want to talk about a song, Deadheads Hate.  They hate this one.  Yeah, because it was too successful.  Very successful.  And why would you want the band that you really like to have any success, dummies? 
[01:13:30]  Remember the video with the skeletons playing?  It was like the little Jerry Garcia fucking skeleton with the beard.  Oh, yeah.  The keyboard player was like,  Oh, it was great.  I liked this one.  It's a little up song.  It's got a fucking chorus.  It's got verses.  It's a real song.  It's a feel-good song.  Right.  There they are.  Look, it's the skeletons they're playing.  That's crazy.  That's insane, right? 
[01:14:00]  I...  Oh, now they're back to regular people.  Now they're skeletons again.  That was great.  Can I try to turn you on to a dead song?  No.  I've been through it all.  Even ashes?  Ashes.  Ashes, ashes.  Give me ashes, ashes.  Am I right?  Let's see if it works.  I don't like it.  I love this one. 
[01:14:30]  There's got to be like a 30-minute version in...  Oh, great.  It's called Ashes to Ashes?  I think so.  Or ashes, or...  Can you look down at your screen there, Ant?  What's the name of the song for real?  What's the name of the song?  That Ashes to Ashes song.  Anyone?  As to Ashes.  Um, no.  As to Ashes.  Fine.  You sure it's not in there?  Butts to Butts.  I don't see it in here, no.  Butts to Butts.  Oh, it's called Throwing Stones.  Okay, right, right, right.  Thanks.  I just did a little Google. 
[01:15:00]  I did a little Googling just now.  You did?  I know it as Ashes, but yeah, it is Throwing Stones.  Throw Throwing Stones on.  Hold on one second.  In honor of the death of Jerry Garcia 18 years ago today,  Dennis Falcone would be proud.  Oh, he would?  Working on...  Working in some shit.  Music.  Are we saying you, though, to the people?  Or are we...  Yes.  I'm trying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Turn this off.  Picture a bright blue bar just danced in vain. 
[01:15:30]  Dizzy with eternity.  Oh, boy.  Hated with the skin of sky.  Bob Weir on vocal style.  I was going to say, who's singing that?  Yeah, no.  It's Brett Weir?  It's Brett Weir.  It's over seven minutes.  Oh, why wouldn't it be?  It's one of their fucking short songs.  Hey, it's the day before of vacation.  Why don't we just play it out?  Oh, God.  We're in casual mode today.  Oh, boy.  It's casual Friday.  It's called Annoy the Listener Day, then.  Let's just do song requests. 
[01:16:00]  I would love to do that.  Is this a solo song or...  No.  Yeah, it's the dead?  Yeah.  I hate this.  I gave it a shot.  I tried.  This part where it just starts getting into a little...  No, I hate it all.  I hate the whole song.  Yeah, it's too bad.  You just don't like...  You don't like songs that jam a little bit, huh?  No, I kind of like a jammy song sometimes, but...  This gets jammy.  Oh, no.  I'm not big on jam.  You know what I like for a good jam? 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  Classical gas.  Oh, my God.  Reminds me of watching Wide World of Sports when I was a kid or something.  Play classical gas.  Wasn't there always...  You're kidding, right?  No, yeah.  Okay.  I heard it yesterday.  I wasn't sure for a second.  I heard it yesterday, and all I'm thinking is, like, this reminds me of a sports show  in the 70s.  Like, they would always conclude, like...  If this is on the radio, I'm listening to it.  And I'm turning it up a little bit.  Dude, there's just something about this.  Turn this up. 
[01:17:00]  This fucking guy knows how to play.  This is what older people try to show off with.  Yes.  When they're playing the guitar.  Yes!  That's funny.  It's like...  And it gets huge after a while.  It just starts with the guitar, and then it just builds.  Right.  You could consider this jamming, maybe.  No?  No, it's pretty structured.  Oh.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  He's just showing off his skills. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  But he made it sound like something.  Yes, his fret work.  And then at first, and then little by little, some shit comes in.  It keeps adding a little something-something.  Yeah, it's like, Wide World of Sports would use this at the end, or some other shows.  All right, here we go.  All right, it's going to kick in any second.  And another.  Doesn't it kick in?  Doesn't it really start going... 
[01:18:00]  It gets huge.  I like songs that build.  It's still just...  You don't know this one, E-Rock?  I know the song, but this is the cut from the 60s channel, so I'm assuming this is the  one they're playing.  Yeah, it's...  It seems rather lackluster.  Well...  And there's a minute left.  Oh, that's it?  I always remember this song, like, really going...  It does!  Who does?  Wait. 
[01:18:30]  Did E-Rock pick the wrong version?  Mason Williams.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right here?  I'll see if there's a different version.  What?  I remember this song differently.  E-Rock, there's a version that just goes insane.  Is there horns that pop in and all that shit?  Horns.  It's fucking huge.  It's like an orchestra.  You sure there's only a minute left in the song?  There's 20 seconds left.  No, man.  There's a different version.  This is the one that's assigned to the 60s channel.  Oh, man.  They must have to have an edit because they, you know. 
[01:19:00]  It's crazy.  You don't want to give those people fucking odds at that.  Let me try this one here.  Diarrhea.  No, because then the horn pops and pop, pop, pop, pop.  Yeah, yeah.  And they really...  Is this a longer version?  Yeah, this one's a three-minute version.  Yeah, yeah, listen.  You hear that?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, now we're rocking.  Now.  Okay.  All right.  It's already, it's already fucking crazy. 
[01:19:30]  It's already rocking.  Yeah.  Not that you...  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  See, here come the strings.  Right.  How was that, Sam?  I told you we were hip, Sam.  This is some hip shit right here.  So lame.  Lame.  Yeah.  Lame. 
[01:20:00]  Totally.  Sorry, they don't say fucking nigga in it 20 times.  That would be cool.  No one's rapping over it.  But if a rap guy takes the riff and makes some, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that it's cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If I wasn't behind it, I would listen to it.  Yeah, classical gas.  Classical gas.  That's what I'm talking about.  Classical.  You know what?  This fucking guy in Florida is absolutely right.  What?  He's absolutely fucking right.  Uh-oh.  And you know what?  I want him to say it on the air.  You're old?  We were both... 
[01:20:30]  Well, we are old.  We're starting to acknowledge that.  But we were both thinking of this song that he's about to say.  Yes, absolutely.  Go ahead, Vern.  Wait, wait, I can't hear you.  Uh-oh, hold on, hold on.  Oh, my God, I can't hear you.  Go ahead, Vern.  Fire on High is the song you're looking for.  You're killing me with this lame guitar shit here.  Oh, ELO.  I think he's right.  Fire on High.  Fire on High is the one that does it.  ELO.  Yeah, he's right.  Check it out.  This is the one that just builds.  Go get it. 
[01:21:00]  It builds.  Thank you.  One of the greatest building songs of all time.  Yeah?  Yes.  A big building song?  Five and a half minutes.  Whoa.  See, that's what I would do with my theme weekends.  The greatest building songs of all time.  Yeah, yeah.  Where they start off slow and just keep building and building.  You should cut the song off right as it's about to hit.  Funeral for a Friend does that.  Yep.  See, they go backwards and all sorts of shit in this song.  You know this one.  ELO.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Is this a movie?  We're watching a movie?  It's very cinematic.  It's crazy.  Oh, this is scary stuff right here.  You remember this, right?  This is stuff, if you smoke weed when you were younger and listen to this, you'd freak  out.  Oh, you hear what he's saying?  He's talking to me.  What is this?  This is stupid.  Well, I didn't need all this shit, obviously, but. 
[01:22:00]  Is this the song we were thinking of?  Yes.  It's not a song yet.  Yes.  This isn't a song yet.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Very big.  Pretty evil.  Demonic.  Sounds like it could be in The Omen.  Get ready with your air guitar.  Or.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  This one is a big one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is epic.  This is epic.  You know how the kids use the word epic, Sam?  They do.  It came from this fucking song right here.  This is epic.  It's like history.  That's right.  CBS uses it for golf tournaments?  Yeah, yeah.  You'll hear that.  And.  CBS Sports presents.  Yeah.  How much longer have we got on this? 
[01:23:00]  Three and a half minutes.  Perfect.  Oh, my God.  Perfect.  And then.  Yeah, here it is.  Very slow.  Starts off.  Sam, what do you think?  I mean.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  Now you like it?  Sounds like an 80s soundtrack.  Does it?  Or a Broadway musical.  Yeah.  It sounds like something Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote. 
[01:23:30]  This should be in Phantom.  Yes.  Phantom.  Wow.  But I love Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Oh, you've got to look like cats.  There we go.  I love cats.  I love cats.  I love cats.  This is what we were thinking of, I'm thinking.  No, I was also thinking of classical gas.  You were.  But it never really kicked in.  Classical gas sucks.  Hey.  I'm going to go out on a limb.  Hey, come on now.  Oh, yeah.  See, we're rocking right here.  And now the everything, the strings come in.  You've got to pop a road soda at this point. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, a road soda.  You're fucking rocking.  Listen to that.  Sounds like a production bed.  The drum is just going crazy here.  Right.  This is the song that the old white guy puts on at the hip-hop party in the movie.  And all the black guys turn around and go, uh-huh.  And they start rapping over it.  They speed it up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What gives you street cred, Sam Roberts? 
[01:24:30]  The old lady starts rapping to it.  The old white lady.  I think you are a rich kid from Westchester.  Make them believe you have street cred.  No, I've seen movies, and I'm aware of what people listen to.  Yeah?  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  I'm very jaded.  I'm not jaded.  You don't know your rock history.  I'm just 29.  You've, you've, oh, 30.  You've, uh...  He's holding on to that 29.  Oh, boy.  Have fun with that.  Like a fucking lifeline.  Have fun with that.  Have fun with that. 
[01:25:00]  Yo, Blake, you'll be 37.  So have fun saying you're 29.  Oh, 30 seems like a week away from pushing 40.  Oh, it's terrible.  Oh, back to this again.  See?  Yeah, I'm not, uh...  This is just fucking crazy right here.  Some crazy shit.  I probably won't add this to my iTunes.  That's too bad.  You're missing out.  It's great.  It's like a soundtrack.  Instrumental section.  It's going to be a life soundtrack.  Driving down the road. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, man.  I'm just thinking about everything.  It sounds like an ad before a YouTube video.  Don't make me put on Jessica by the Allman Brothers.  Oh, boy.  I know Jessica.  I'll fuck your shit up with some Jessica.  My wife is named after Jessica.  We're even getting requests for Jessica.  Named after that song?  My wife is named after that song, yes.  Whoa.  Oh, that's right.  I did know that.  Sam's father-in-law is basically a deadhead.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  He loves the Allman Brothers and the Dead.  I like him a lot. 
[01:26:00]  Wow.  He's a big time, like, all 70s rock.  Do you rag on him and his music?  No, because he doesn't push it on me.  Ah.  What are you talking about?  How do I know that?  Whenever I see him, he's playing, like, the Dead or the Allman Brothers.  Yeah, but he's not sitting there going, like, your father-in-law sucks up.  Why are you dressed like that?  Jay-Z's ruining songs.  What are you?  Jay-Z's ruining songs.  He's not making me fight for my life.  Oh.  Oh, be mad just because I speak the truth.  People get mad at me because they speak the truth.  No, because you make up some bullshit to get people upset. 
[01:26:30]  That's why people get mad at you.  No, I've never done that in my life.  Constantly.  Yeah, now we're talking.  Great Tootelie Do song.  One of the greatest instrumental songs of all time.  I need a new whistle.  We're proud of you.  These guys knew how to play their instruments, Sam.  Unlike the artists of today.  It's like a commercial for a travel site.  All right, Iraq.  You're not that much fucking younger than us. 
[01:27:00]  You're in the slot between Sam and us, all right?  Is that...  He's jumping on my side?  He's trying to push his age a little lower than it really is.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  You want to go with...  Just keeping the beat in the background.  Everyone's just doing their part.  Working together. 
[01:27:30]  Synergy.  They all got the same destination and their sights, and that is awesomeness.  All going to the same place, just different methods of transportation.  Wow, very good. 
[01:28:00]  Crankin'.  Can I do one more request?  Yeah.  If you don't mind.  I like this.  Can we go with In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, please?  Oh, my God.  In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, please.  Live version?  How many versions we got in the system?  Iraq, please tell us how long the live version is.  There's 18 versions.  I know.  18 versions.  There's a big song.  What's the longest version of it?  I'm going to go with...  Hold on.  I was going to say 22 minutes.  It might be pushing 30. 
[01:28:30]  I'm sorting by...  There might be a 30-minute version.  Oh, my God.  Duration?  No, no, no.  Well, the longest version is not by the Allman Brothers.  Oh.  Who did it?  It's a group called Great Caesar's Ghost.  What?  I don't know what that is.  They're obviously on the jam station.  But the second longest is Allman Brothers at 13 and a half minutes.  Nice.  It's just no need.  Can we hear a little piece of it? 
[01:29:00]  Of the long version?  It's just self-indulgent.  No, the Allman Brothers.  It is self-indulgent at that point.  That's what I mean.  The long live Allman Brothers?  Much like when rappers just rap over each other.  Right.  Self-indulgent.  Rap over the beautiful voice.  Yes.  But at least you don't go to a show.  New York!  Yeah, New York!  That's what I'm talking about!  Yeah, yeah!  Yeah, I know!  Yes!  Of course!  New York!  Yeah!  In the club, New York!  New York, yeah!  Let her sing!  Let her sing! 
[01:29:30]  Let her fucking sing!  Right?  You end up going to one of these concerts and you hear four songs because they just have  to keep them going.  Ugh.  Yes, they do.  Right?  You continue being closed-minded.  Yeah, I'm closed-minded.  You're missing out on a lot.  Yes, it's me.  You should eat steak and you should listen to the Allman Brothers.  Oh my God.  Listen to this.  I should go where you are.  You shouldn't come to me.  Listen to this.  There's no problems in the world when you hear this.  It's because it's 30 years ago.  Rap music makes you all just tense and scared.  This is from the year 1970, this version. 
[01:30:00]  Oh my God.  1970.  Rap music gives you anxiety, gets you scared of the world.  And this, look, man, there's nothing going on, man.  I had an episode this morning, driving in.  Of what?  Of near violence.  Why?  What happened?  What were you listening to?  10-10 wins.  Dude, it's that John Montone.  I was driving and the light was green for me, of course.  I'm driving up, I guess, 47th.  Let's keep this as the soundtrack. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, we'll keep mellow.  Yeah.  I was driving up 47th or whatever it is, 48th maybe, I don't know.  But I drive up it every morning and the lights are green.  They're timed properly.  So I have to make every green light.  Sure.  If I get slowed down at one, I'm going to be fucked at the next.  So they're doing some construction where the crosswalk, it's completely blocked off by a  big wall and people just walk right out.  Yeah.  With the fucking thing, and you're piling in.  So I normally, when I'm coming up to it, I go, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. 
[01:31:00]  I just beep the horn.  There were some people crossing and I was beeping the horn, not for the people already in the  crosswalk, but to alert other people that might be walking, because it's a total blind  spot, not to step out.  Yeah, you don't want that in your brain.  This motherfucker that was in the crosswalk when I was beeping, he was at the sidewalk  already.  Right.  I fucking turns around, yells something, and I hear thud, and his cup of coffee just  smashes all over my fucking window. 
[01:31:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  I fucking lay on the brakes.  Lay on the fucking brakes.  I skid.  How many rounds did you fire this time?  Uh, full mag.  Wow.  Full mag.  Seven rounds.  I, uh, but I got out of the, I got out of the truck, and I'm fucking yelling.  I start yelling at the guy.  I go, throw shit at my truck, you fucking faggot.  I was yelling at him.  You said the F word.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have fun with HR.  That's not going to be good. 
[01:32:00]  Have fun with HR.  It was outside the building.  Still.  HR is jurisdiction.  I was like, yeah.  And he turns around and looks, and I go, yeah, keep walking.  Keep walking.  You fucking motherfucker.  And I threw a few more epithets out, and then, uh, it was a white guy, so don't worry.  But, uh, and then I got back there.  Well, we knew it was a white guy, because you said faggot.  Well, that's true.  You would have, you know.  Yeah, I would have dropped an N-bomb on him.  Probably.  But it was a dumb white guy.  Uh, yeah, so I just fucking yelled, and he kept walking. 
[01:32:30]  He wanted no part of me.  Where was this, Anthony, when the guy took out my side view mirror?  Hey, he was close.  Hey, if the guy started running after me.  I had plenty of time to get back in my truck and speed away.  We were shock jocks with this incredible edge, but we sat there like two fucking pussies  as this animal takes out my very involved side view mirror with one punch.  Oh, he just left those dumb cables hanging.  Holy fuck. 
[01:33:00]  It looked like fucking C-3PO's arm was ripped off.  There's just cables moving to the mirror.  Well, I did bump the guy, but.  Yes, you did.  But we needed to, you know, get through the green light.  It was a green light, but the pedestrians kept walking across.  Yep.  I think it was 57th Street.  And very slowly walking.  And it was around 5th Avenue, where a lot of tourists are.  Oh, I hate that.  And he was going slowly, so I decided to give him a little tap with my car.  Yeah.  Sam Roberts.  A little tap with my car.  A little tap, tap.  This guy didn't even hesitate.  Goes to the side of my car, which was Anthony's side. 
[01:33:30]  He was in the passenger seat.  He did like Hulk smash on the fucking mirror.  He just lifted his fist.  It was unbelievable.  Bam!  Straight down.  Cracked the mirror right off the fucking side of the car.  How could a person have that much anger?  All you got to do is tap him, and it just unleashed.  Oh, yeah.  I just tapped him into my car.  I thought, you know.  Give him a little kneecap.  That was proper etiquette.  You gave him a little kneecap.  But the strength this guy had, and like I said, the thing was hanging by two cables.  It was one of those really involved side view mirrors.  You exchanged insurance information after. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, my God.  We were scared shitless.  I'm not even going to front.  I didn't even turn to look at him doing it.  I still just looked straight ahead like it wasn't happening.  Just look at him.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  My mirror, just go.  I made a huge mistake.  Just go.  I made a huge mistake.  We were scared shitless.  Two little pussy boys.  Oh, boy, were we.  It was a brand new car, too.  Yeah.  And then that thing hung there for, this says a lot about me. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, a long time.  It hung there for at least a month to the point where I had a half circle because it was just.  Every time it was like a pendulum.  It was just a pendulum.  It was like a perfect compass.  Right.  You weren't worried about it like the cables breaking and then your mirror would just fall off one day?  I guess.  If the cable didn't break when Hulk smashed it, it wasn't coming off from bumps in the road.  He smashed your window off and you went, okay, okay, sir.  One punch.  Do you understand?  I said, try that again, though, and you'll see me. 
[01:35:00]  All right, there's two mirrors.  Go ahead.  I think he broke his hand and he just was too cool about to not let us know that it hurt.  Did he keep walking after that?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  He just punched it and left.  Punched it and walked.  Insane.  It was.  It was crazy.  He was a big, I bet his friends call him Moose.  He was a guy that you would nickname like, hey, look, Moose is here.  Right.  And he'd walk in.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Mongo.  Keg on his shoulder.  Yeah.  I thought, you know, we were safe in the comfort of my car, so I figured a little tap would 
[01:35:30]  be all right.  Yeah.  A little tap.  Just a tap to the hip.  Let him know.  Bump into the hip.  I'm in a motor vehicle, sir.  I have more power than you.  Sir.  Because we had to rush home to our wonderful lives on Long Island.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Our just incredible lives.  Let's make sure we get home quickly.  Gotta get home fast.  Catch her before she has fucking two or three drinks in her.  Maybe get a moment of fucking, of vision of who I once saw.  At least if that dude had put you in the hospital, you wouldn't have had to go home. 
[01:36:00]  That's true.  You know when the 50s dad would come home and everything was like, hey, it was all nice.  Honey, I'm home, junior.  Yeah.  My opening line every day was, what's the problem today?  And then the answer.  What's wrong today?  Nothing.  What's wrong today?  Yeah.  God, then you gotta fucking listen to nothing and wonder why.  So that's so, so as soon as you walked in the door, that buzz you got from having like  a good show?  Oh, just gone. 
[01:36:30]  It would be gone.  Oh, uh, yeah.  Like a sort of creative thing that like.  Like a sort of creative thing that like.  Just driving up on, when I turned and saw, when I turned and saw the street name, I was  like, oh boy.  So you felt like you were going to school when you were going home.  I think that sort of dread.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Responsibilities.  Yes.  I think Anthony has the same feeling when he passes his old house as people have when  they pass Ariel Castro's house.  Ariel Castro.  I lived in a house of horror.  Especially the girls, because I'm sure they've driven by the house. 
[01:37:00]  Sure.  For the goof.  Since they've been freed.  Yeah.  I bet you they've driven by a couple times.  I want to speak for people that have horrible marriages.  I think that God should look after the people that have horrible marriages.  Oh, what a weirdo she is.  Well, she.  I understand, but.  She might look a little weird, but man, does she have bravery.  Yes.  Back to you.  What a courageous young woman.  I'm being gracious.  She's apparently two feet tall, too, I think. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  She's very small.  She's very tiny.  I guess being beaten stunts your growth.  Yeah.  She went into that house.  She was 5'8".  Yeah, yeah.  Just shows you what kind of horror was going on.  Oh.  There's much good work to be done.  Oh, God.  This loony girl.  You know, I get a bit of a shiver when I drive by your old house.  Because I still drive by your old house a lot, because it's on the way to FH Riley's.  It's right down the street from FH. 
[01:38:00]  So I've seen it many, many times since you've left there.  The windows that you stuff, the candles in them.  Yeah, I get a little like, not a shiver, but a little, just a little, hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't get excited if there were candles.  Didn't that mean sex night?  Yes, it did.  Certainly did.  It meant hubba hubba.  There's going to be some action tonight.  And meanwhile, all I wanted to do was get on the computer and play Half-Life.  It's not good.  The best part, it would just go, ah, candle night. 
[01:38:30]  Ah, it's so bad.  Ah, see you tomorrow.  Runs around the block, oh.  Well, that is true.  Just drive around a couple of times.  Drop me off at New York Avenue.  I want a drink.  That's really bad.  When you're in a marriage, and you don't enjoy having sex with your wife.  It's called candle night, Sam.  But then you also don't enjoy not having sex with your wife.  Like, you don't like the conversation.  I didn't like anything.  I didn't want to be in the same fucking room. 
[01:39:00]  Same house.  Ever.  No.  Wow, this song is really happy.  That's why it only lasted nine years.  You should have thought of getting out of that sooner.  I really should have, huh?  You had to wait for a nice catalyst, though.  Yeah, I needed a good shove.  Yeah.  Boy, did you get one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we're still listening to In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.  Yeah, we are.  What do you think of this, Sam?  It's too long, isn't it?  It's just, yeah, Elizabeth Reed.  Elizabeth Reed. 
[01:39:30]  Speed it up, put a drum machine behind it, and then I'll let you know.  But right now, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  It's going well.  I think the song is going well.  I don't like songs that you have to have a conversation.  Like, you can't just listen to this.  This is background stuff.  Well.  I like foreground songs.  This is background stuff.  It's a jam.  Yeah, but it gets you all tense.  It's a jam.  No, it gets my ego off.  I like that.  I need that.  That new song by Ton Lok, Wild Thing.  That's a little fucking new song. 
[01:40:00]  Couldn't be older.  Couldn't be an older song.  That song is dated.  What about Young MC?  What song did he do?  Bust the Move.  Bust the Move.  Right.  Yeah.  Did he change his name?  I was trying to figure it out.  Because I, I, I.  Yes, Sam Roberts.  Oh.  That's right.  Who knew?  He changed his name to, like, Parent MC or Old MC or.  Yeah, it's hard to be Young MC when you're fucking.  Not so Young MC.  Look, he's bald.  I don't know.  It looks like he's still a Young MC.  It looks like no one gives a fuck because he only has 2,600 followers on Twitter. 
[01:40:30]  How did he get verified?  I'm not verified.  I was looking at that the other day.  I'm like, Sam Roberts isn't verified.  I feel like I should be verified.  I could get that done in a second.  You gotta go.  Why wouldn't you?  Because you haven't been nice to me lately.  I'm nice to you all the time.  Not really.  Yeah.  I hear the undertones.  I got, do you get verified through the same guy I did?  I ain't saying.  Yeah.  I know who got you verified.  Who?  You shouted her out on the air one time and she got pissed. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Oh, because I didn't do the other side of that.  I was supposed to promote something.  And I never promoted.  Jenny Hutt got me verified.  Oh.  And she goes, but my friend.  How the fuck did she do it?  And she goes, but my friend has a blog.  Can you just mention it once?  I'm like, yeah, no problem.  You know people are getting verified.  People get, like, agents.  Yeah.  And these agents have digital, you know, sections of their agentry or whatever it's called.  Yeah.  Obviously I'm in the business.  Yes.  And then they just pay. 
[01:41:30]  Like, you pay your agent and your agent gets you verified.  Oh.  Fucking Nicole's verified.  That's crazy.  That is crazy that she's verified.  Yeah, she's stupid.  I hope.  Yeah, she's stupid.  She's stupid.  I necessarily mean this.  What happened?  Oh, man.  Is this song almost over, E-Rock?  I was trying to get to the end of it.  I don't know.  You see?  About a minute.  Yeah, see, there's...  It'll either go...  No, that's...  This is the part where it wakes you up from the coma to go, okay, we're going to finish this 
[01:42:00]  now, people.  The drum solo.  I'd be so bored at a concert if this song was on.  No, they'd be passing around the wine satchel.  Yeah.  And joints would just be coming back and forth.  You don't even know where they came from.  It was a different time, Sam.  I guess so.  People knew how to calm their brains down for a little bit.  People would pass joints and not even want them back.  Like, they would hit and then pass it off to their left or something, and then it would  just go down the line.  And someone, you don't even know, would, like, elbow you.  You're like, huh?  And then they'd go, and you'd go, oh, thanks. 
[01:42:30]  And then you'd pass it off, and then a wine fucking satchel thing would come by, and you're  fucking drinking that.  Sounds like a lot of germs.  It was crazy germs.  No bad diseases came out of the 70s.  They have the laser lights with it?  Yes.  It was great.  That's it.  There you go.  Nothing was more fun than going to a concert, like one of these old concerts around the  4th of July, where people would literally throw blockbusters from the upper tier into  the crowd on the floor, but it would blow up above them, because they'd time it. 
[01:43:00]  But it's so fucking dangerous.  How is that not tense?  I would feel very tense if somebody was throwing crazy.  So you know how arrested you'd be right now, in a second, terroristic, bombs, you're bombing.  The news would be like, I end up bombing at a concert today!  Class 2 explosives.  Yes, explosives.  Oh, Taita Al-Qaeda?  No, it's Charlie Daniels. 
[01:43:30]  Or they go to a Young MC concert.  Ah, Bust a Move.  Can we do a little Bust a Move into break?  You got it.  Why?  Old school rap rules.  I thought this was new.  Well, it's about 10 years old now, I think.  You know, it's not even dated, though.  This sounds very current still.  It's extremely dated.  All right, we'll be back.  I want to listen to the words, man.  Ah, ah, ah, mate.  This here's a champ for all the fellas.  Try to do what those ladies tell us.  Get shot down because you're overzealous.  Play hard to get females, get jealous. 
[01:44:00]  Okay, smarty, go to a party.  Girls are scantily cladish, so embody.  A chick walks by you with chicken sex,  a bunch of standing on the wall like he was Poindexter.  Next day's function, high-class luncheon.  Food is served in your stone-cold munchin'.  Music comes on, people start to dance,  but then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants.  A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'.  Sits down next to you and starts talkin'.  Says she wanna dance cause she likes to groove,  So come on, fatso, and just bust the move.  Ah, ah, yeah.

Lookin' for love in all the wrong places,  No five girls, just ugly faces.  From frustration, first inclination,  Is to become a monk and leave the situation.  But every dark tunnel has a lighter hop,  So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope.  There are movies showin', so you're goin'  Could care less about the five you're blowing

Hey, bust a move  Just bust a move  In the city, ladies look pretty

[01:48:00]  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show is back  The Opie and Anthony Show is back  Go on, sit down  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more  Hmm  Hmm  Hmm  Ah  Right. 
[01:48:30]  Hamster commercial.  Right.  You're fucking driving in the car, getting all fucking hamstery.  Yep.  Old school rap day.  We're calling it?  Nice.  It's weird. In prison, some of the white guys are called black guys hamsters.  I heard that.  Yeah.  I remember I was staying at some friend's house back in the day, when I didn't have a place to live, really. 
[01:49:00]  And his brother had just gotten out of prison for robbing a gas station.  Armed robbery.  And he would just tell these hilarious stories of prison life.  And he would be like, yeah, and then the fucking hamsters would come over and cause some problems.  So, yeah, that was like a thing that I guess the white guys would call black guys in prison.  But why?  I don't know. Hamster? I don't know. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, this is like a hamster commercial.  Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.  I was saying how, uh...  I don't know who does this.  I don't either.  Black Sheep.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  I was saying how upset I was at the new Kmart back-to-school commercials last night.  Right. 
[01:50:00]  Of course.  Keybonics won.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's the one where, um...  They're like, let me ask you something.  And it's like...  And all the kids are really kind of wiggered out and stuff.  And talking all ghetto.  And it just seems like...  Is that really what you want to kind of push?  Isn't it just a goof?  Because the girl also says fiscally responsible in it.  I know.  But that's just it, too, you know?  Then they get the little ghetto kid, and she's the one that, you know, is all articulate.  Well, let me see this thing.  But I don't think, like... 
[01:50:30]  Like, after watching, like, Rachel Jantel's testimony and stuff, isn't it apparent that  the education system is not really doing its job as far as teaching kids English?  And then to perpetuate it with a commercial where it's just showing kids sounding like  morons.  Yeah, let me ask you something.  Uh-uh.  And it's like...  It's the whole ghetto attitude that's just, like, fucking...  It makes it, um, accepted, you know?  But that's how you tell yo mama jokes, isn't it? 
[01:51:00]  Like, could you really do it without...  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  You don't know.  Julio!  I need to ask you a question.  What is it, Capadre?  Did yo mama get that hoodie at Kmart?  Yeah, dog.  Well, yo mama must have calories, because that hoodie is sweet!  Oh, yeah?  Well, yo mama's like a tasty cheese plate.  Because she took up a chichetta on them Kmart jeans.  Oh!  Well, yo mama's got so much game that she couldn't even store it on that tablet. 
[01:51:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Come on!  Yo mama's so fashion-forward, the future girl, they want those hot tops back.  Oh!  Well, yo mama's so fiscally responsible, she got all that on free layaway.  No!  I don't know.  Shop your way, members.  Get free layaway at Kmart.  Why is he doing this?  You have two years to touch here.  Because it's funny.  Why is he doing this?  He's stretching.  You got a chubby Asian guy in little shorts to stretch.  You have two years to touch here. 
[01:52:00]  It's great.  Ah, whatever.  I understand it's a goof.  Positive mama jokes.  I understand it's a goof.  You know?  I'm not stupid all the time.  I understand it's a goof, but it's just, I don't know.  I don't mind that at all.  In this environment we're in, in this, you know, it's sort of, I don't know.  It seems to be, like, why not just then put cigarette commercials on?  You know?  It's going to be detrimental to the children.  That's how you say ask, though. 
[01:52:30]  Let me ask you something.  That's just how it is now.  I don't know how that happened.  Yeah.  Wow, man.  Gray white sharks.  They're scary.  Shark week, of course.  Everybody, uh, all crazy about sharks on Discovery.  Yeah.  What was there, a shark in the fucking subway or something?  Yeah.  Some fucking kids from Coney Island threw a shark in the train?  Yeah.  And they were doing, like, Sharknado things in the news?  Is it a case of Sharknado? 
[01:53:00]  Uh, no.  In your neighborhood?  Ah, well, it was on the subway.  Mm.  Yeah, play that video.  It's fucking a foot long.  I know.  It's a dumb little thing.  Something fishy in New York sometimes.  A dead shark turned up on an empty subway train on Wednesday.  Apparently it gave strap hangers quite a nose bull during the morning commute.  Now, this all comes just in time, he says, with a hint of skepticism, in time for the  Discovery Channel's annual Shark Week. 
[01:53:30]  So, New Yorkers are wondering whether the finned creature was left behind from the Sharknado or  whether this is one big publicist.  It's a real shark.  Pause.  It's a real dead shark.  People weren't thinking either one of those things.  No.  No.  Who are these people?  They thought somebody.  Someone thought twice about it.  The news is all about it.  That's it.  Threw a dead shark.  There's a dead shark on the train.  That's inconvenient.  No one was thinking, wait, is this, you know, a publicity stunt for Shark Week or Sharknado? 
[01:54:00]  No.  No one was thinking that at all, actually.  Hmm.  I think most people realize, oh, it's dopey kids, you know, throwing a fucking dead shark  on the subway.  Anyway, I think this is my stop.  I got to get off.  I got to go to work.  Huh?  I got to go to work.  I got to go to work.  Stand clear of the closing jaws, it says.  Whoa.  That's crazy.  I get it because it's very, very funny.  How did they end it?  Because now they got to do their little banter, their news banter.  I heard on local news, they said it had a cigarette in its jaw and apparently a newspaper 
[01:54:30]  under its fins.  It sounds like a cruel prank.  It's very cruel.  It was just fucking smoking and read the paper.  It smelled really bad, but better than a typical subway car.  They're going to need a bigger subway.  Because some of those homeless people can really stink, right?  Matt Lauer, you're a card.  You know, you smell like shit.  You get so much fucking money to do hacked shit like that.  Great.  So much.  And it wasn't a cruel prank. 
[01:55:00]  Some kids found a dead shark and say, well, fuck, let's put it in our book bag and we'll  just drop it on the subway on the way home.  Where's the cruelty?  Where's the cruel part of it?  It's annoying.  Didn't kill the shark.  I guarantee that.  No.  It was washed up on the beach.  Yep.  On the beach.  Yep.  And they were like, let's take it.  And then they brought it in the subway car and they're like, what are we going to do  with this shark?  Just leave it.  Oh, let's just leave it.  And that's the end of it.  Pretty much.  Um, what's going on with this young woman in Australia?  I don't know this one, Sam Roberts. 
[01:55:30]  She is a gem.  What happened?  Uh, you're pretty much calling her the dumbest person ever.  She's very, very dumb.  She's way up there?  Did she call, uh, the hospital in England and, uh, make someone kill themselves?  It's this 27-year-old and she's running for some kind of political office in Australia.  Right.  But, uh, what do they have down there?  What do they have down there?  Fucking magistrates?  I don't know.  I don't know what it, um, I don't know.  But she's very anti-Islam and she was sticking, uh, stickers.  A constable?  A constable? 
[01:56:00]  Is she running for constable?  She was sticking.  Constabulary?  Stickers on the halal food that were anti-Islam.  So she might go to jail for that.  And you can't run for office if you end up in jail.  But she talked to the Australian News, uh, about her viewpoints and if she thinks she can win.  Oh, good.  Hot aloka.  So you're calling her one of the dumbest.  Fucking muzzies.  Hot aloka.  Who are some of the great dumb people of all time?  Great dumb people of all time.  Especially politically.  Dan Quayle. 
[01:56:30]  Sure.  Dan Quayle was way up there.  He comes up as a dummy.  Mm-hmm.  Sarah Palin put her foot in her mouth.  Sarah Palin, yes.  He comes off as a great dummy.  Mm-hmm.  A great, one of the great dumb fucks of our time.  Mm.  Uh, who else?  I don't know if they're a general dummy, but, uh, Dukakis did a dumb thing at least.  Dukakis was, yeah.  A dumb thing.  A dummy.  Who else?  Uh, Anthony Weiner. 
[01:57:00]  Just doing...  Is a dummy.  Well, he's stupid for, you know, doing what he was doing.  He just loves to jack that dick.  He loves it.  Any updates on Weiner and the pig?  Weiner and the pig.  Nothing?  Not today, but...  All right.  I'm hearing Anthony Weiner still does not give a fuck.  I like that.  He don't give a fuck.  Nope.  I like that.  Good for him.  I don't give a fuck.  Good for him.  Nice.  And another guy that doesn't give a fuck is A-Rod, and he's, uh, what?  He's got a home game tonight, finally?  Oh, boy.  Let's see how that works out. 
[01:57:30]  Daily News isn't playing.  You see the back...  The sports page?  Turn it over and read what they just wrote.  Boo the bum.  They just wrote, boo the bum.  They're just basically telling everyone, if you're going to Yankee Stadium tonight, boo  the bum.  It's not even a play on words this time.  No.  No, they're not playing.  It's not even...  Look at how they write it, though.  In very small writing, they put, with disgraced A-Rod back home, Girardi unsure if Bomber fans  will, dot, dot, dot, giant letters, boo the bum.  So they're saying they're not sure if he's going to get booed, but they're saying boo 
[01:58:00]  him.  Right.  That's great.  Clever.  That is clever.  Keeps him from inciting.  What?  Jackie just gave me my last vegetable juice that she'll ever get.  Wow.  I don't know how you drink that.  What?  Because it's got beets and...  Beets?  And orange and carrots and...  Spinach.  I wasn't going to say that one.  Spinach.  She says spinach.  Oh, yeah.  Spinach.  Spinach.  Yo, you're spinach-ing that basketball.  Yes.  Spinach.  You know, if previous...  Wow.  Total spinach.  Total spinach. 
[01:58:30]  If previous interns had stepped up to the mic that quickly, they literally would have  been thrown out by the seat of their pants.  Oh, my God.  Or they'd be wearing this juice.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Wearing the juice.  You know how to drink it?  You know how to fucking wear it?  Yeah, that's it.  And questioning you.  That hasn't been an outfit yet.  Huh?  I could have sported it.  It hasn't been an outfit.  Oh, right, right.  You say right.  Well, her little outfits.  She wears different outfits every day.  I'm going to play a sound bite.  You've worn that dress before, I believe, but not with that belt. 
[01:59:00]  No, I've seen the belt.  Well, yeah.  I've seen the belt.  I wear the belt.  Not with that dress, though.  I know.  Not with that dress.  I've seen the belt.  You don't even remember the other interns' names.  And you remember her belts and accessories.  Yeah, she wears the belt to accessorize some of her other outfits that she brought down from  Well, this is also a size too big, so I wear the belt in it.  Ah.  It doesn't make me look as frumpy.  How interested are you?  You look wonderful, too.  I mean, I'm not interested, but O&A are pretending to be. 
[01:59:30]  You're supposed to be complimenting her.  It's crazy.  Never buy bigger sizes, because then, you know, you're going to go, you know what, I could  have another ho-ho.  Keep them clothes tight.  You've got to keep them tight, yo.  Never had a ho-ho.  No?  No.  Ring ding?  No.  Devil dog?  No.  Ding dong?  She's got so much life to experience.  Snow hoes, ring dings, ding dongs, gas station snack cakes.  Those pink snowball things. 
[02:00:00]  Those look weird.  Those are terrible.  You can peel the pink snowball stuff off, it's like rubber, and then you just eat the  cakey part in a pinch, you know?  Talking about nobody giving her a snowball, there's no jokes to be made.  It's all class here.  You're looking for a snowball joke?  I was there.  Yeah.  No, we wouldn't do that.  You wouldn't do that, though.  No.  Our mom's coming in today.  Our mom's coming in.  Last time an intern brought his mom in, the mom ended up getting a lap dance.  From Troy Kwan?  Yes.  From the great Troy Kwan.  We won't see him no more. 
[02:00:30]  No.  Well, no.  Well, not for a while.  We got him back.  Not for like a month, right?  Yeah, he has to sit out a little bit.  That's got to be great, though, knowing you still have a job, but you're off for a month.  Come on.  They just gave him a fucking month-long vacation.  When I talked to Troy the other day, I'm like, how cool is this?  How fucking cool is it?  I mean, it can't be a punishment if you give a guy the month of August off.  Right?  I'm like, go enjoy this summer.  This is the coolest thing ever.  I was thinking rules.  Yesterday on Ryan.  By the way, I hate to interrupt you.  If you're going to suspend someone, you give them like February.  Yeah.  Or January. 
[02:01:00]  Horrible fucking months.  Not August.  August is the greatest month ever.  Sam, what would have happened if any other intern would have then pulled a chair up and  now sat down in front of the mic?  Like, we start talking about something else.  We start talking about Troy.  Right.  And instead of being like, looking at her, why the fuck are you still here?  We're like, go pull up a chair, Jackie.  Make yourself comfortable.  And if an intern would have done that, it would have been like, oh, you're making yourself  at home?  Yeah.  Here in the studio?  What are you, third mic?  Especially on a Friday?  Right.  Where just like, we're just fucking around anyway? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, she's done a great job.  What?  How are you guys going to get through now without the likes of Jackie?  We already lost Sidney.  Same way.  No, without Jackie.  We just got that greasy-haired kid.  I mean, literally the same way we did before.  Why was his last day the last day of summer?  Yeah, why did he do you guys trade off?  Oh, man.  I think he's strategizing.  Of course he is.  He wants, like, special time.  He'll get that week.  He wants special time.  That's when he's going to get in his FaceTime.  Nice. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, he thinks because of your girls.  Some quality time.  He thinks because the girls are gone, we're going to pay attention to him now?  Yeah, he's like, I have feminine hair.  That ain't going to happen.  Nope.  Every dude that comes into this fucking place as an intern now is just cursed.  Well, that's what they were before, too.  No morale boosters.  We're bringing in a legacy next time.  Oh, the guy that loves pictures of Opie in his room.  He did everything I did at Geneseo.  He's on the radio station.  He pledged the same fraternity.  I don't want to deal with my crap. 
[02:02:30]  I can't wait to see E-Rock get competitive about, like, who's really the Opie guy and  who's the Opie expert and who's the...  You don't even know.  It's going to be alpha mailing, like Sidney's boyfriend.  Yeah.  Did you hear about that?  Of course you did.  You know all the scuttlebutt around here.  You liked it?  Wait, what happened?  Apparently, Sidney, our other intern, that is no longer...  She left early.  And you remember her name. 
[02:03:00]  Her boyfriend came in to, I guess, pick her up or something, get her out of here.  Yeah.  And he was a dick.  And I guess E-Rock let him know by saying, you're a dick.  Did you really, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Why?  What happened?  She first brings him in and she introduces us to him.  And he seemed nice enough or whatever.  And he just looks around the room and he goes, hey, look how lazy everyone is around here,  all just sitting around.  What the fuck is that about?  That's like horrible.  The show's over. 
[02:03:30]  I mean, it's not incorrect, but well, it's not his place.  It's an impolite thing to bring up.  And we just looked at each other like, what are we supposed to say to this guy?  Right.  So they leave.  And she forgot her sweater and to give me the ID.  So she had to come back up.  And so she gives me IDs and signing something.  And as she's signing something, he goes, is there anything else that she has to do here?  Oh, man.  This is at the reception desk in the lobby.  And I just look up, I'm like, you're a dick.  Nice. 
[02:04:00]  Good for you.  I didn't yell, but I just went, you're a dick.  Like in a conversation kind of.  Do you think he was a little jealous?  Of course he was.  Was he threatened the whole time she was here, maybe?  I don't think there's much going on up here.  No.  Oh, man.  You think he's dumb?  Oh, man.  He was zoning out.  Jackie, what did you see?  You're a girl.  He just, it was just, I loved his salmon color shirt.  And he just came in.  Oh, he's one of those guys.  Cruddy flip-flops.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with salmon.  Salmon sucks.  Please.  Oh, so he's like fucking. 
[02:04:30]  What is he, a surfer guy?  I don't know.  I picked up on a vibe where he's like a little like.  Like he was too good to be here.  But no, a little like threatened.  Like a little like, I gotta make sure these guys know I'm cool.  Because, you know, my chick thinks they're cool.  And I don't, I can't match up with them.  You know what you're doing in that case?  He wasn't.  You fucking zip down.  You pull your dick out.  You piss all over her leg.  In front of him.  And go, yeah, mine.  Mine.  That'll fucking shut him up.  He can barely fit through the door, too. 
[02:05:00]  He's like six, five.  What is he, tall?  Yeah.  Called like.  He's six.  Gangly?  Yeah.  Like gangly.  He's six, five sitting.  He's like, what?  I don't know.  Four, ten?  Wow.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, he's a legit six, two.  Yeah, he's a six, two.  Oh, yeah.  And she's legit under five foot.  Yeah.  Legit under five foot, yes.  So he's got to at least bend down.  Oh, that's, that's a, that's a fetish.  That does.  Yeah.  I mean, he's, he's.  Six, two, four, ten.  He's a foot and a half taller than she is.  Yeah.  That's always weird when you see that shit walking down the sidewalk. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's real weird, like holding hands, he's got to duck down with the arm around each other  and it just looks a little strange.  Wasn't Troy saying it was weird?  He dated like a really little girl one time and.  I think so.  He didn't like bending over to kiss her.  He said it.  I heard he fucking told her like, fuck you and threatened to beat her up.  Different girl.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I thought that was.  It was a different chick.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to get to the, uh, the dumb Australian.  Thank you, Jackie. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, Jackie.  Don't worry.  We got a little something planned for you.  Oh, my God.  Just in case you were wondering.  Jackie's last day.  Oh, my God.  We're going to dedicate the last half hour of the show today to you and your wonderful internship.  Oh, my God.  What?  It's horrible.  What?  You want us to go back to being assholes?  Or do you like the new version of us?  We're finally treating the interns nicely.  It's the new version of us.  Yeah.  You guys have been assholes to me all day.  Today.  What?  What?  What are you talking about?  Well, you fucking invited.  No.  Dressing like that.  How dare you? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  We're holding back.  You know what we can really say?  Relax.  Look at your stupid belt.  Jackie had a nice belt on.  Yours is stupid.  Her belt was terrific.  It really was.  It really compliments the outfit she's wearing.  That sundress of hers today.  Yeah.  Brown leather belt.  It's very summery.  A lot of summer outfits going on.  Oh, boy.  What the F?  Did we not prepare for today's show?  I tune it to laugh.  Not hear music.  What?  It's a Friday. 
[02:07:00]  We just want to play a little music.  What happened?  All right.  So.  Denny would like it.  Oh, thank you, E-Rock.  Oh.  Which one is it?  Funky Cold Medina or Wild Thing?  They use the same exact music.  Great question.  The Funky Cold Medina.  Funky Cold Medina.  Wild Thing.  Wah, wah.  Wow.  That's the Jamie's Crying riff from Van Halen, by the way. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I hear it.  Right here.  With this one.  Right here.  Now, back to when Tom Lowe does it, he's not stealing, but when, well, years ago, we  did say he was stealing, but now we're over it.  Yeah, we're good now.  We're over it now.  Okay.  We're good.  We're good now.  We're good now.  All right, let's go to Australia and listen to The Dumbest Woman Alive.  Ooh.  It's Stephanie, and she's running for office down there, I guess.  Yep.  Stephanie Bannister is a migrant, an alleged criminal.  Hello? 
[02:08:00]  Stephanie Bannister.  Hello?  And at 27, One Nation's poster girl for young voters in rankings.  I don't oppose Islam as a country, but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome  here in Australia.  The religion is at the center of her political beliefs.  The mother of two from Kingston wants halal food banned.  Food?  What?  She said she doesn't oppose Islam as a country.  As a country.  Right.  The country of Islam.  Right.  She doesn't have any problem with the country of Islam.  When you're Islamic, you are from Islam. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  Is that her?  No.  She's Islamish.  All right.  Nay.  Islam, a lot of people don't know this, is not actually a country.  What?  Yeah, no.  Well, she talks about the Koran in this next clip.  The Koran?  With shade?  She attempts to talk about the Koran.  No, she does a very good job.  Less than 2% of Australians follow Haram.  Or the Koran, as the Islamic text is known.  No.  Kosher thing for Jewish Australians is fine. 
[02:09:00]  Jews aren't under Haram.  They have their own religion, which follows Jesus Christ.  Judaism rejects Jesus Christ.  Just like Islam, it has its own dietary law and food certification.  They don't have a tax on it.  They've just got a certain way of making it, where Haram has a tax on the food.  Kosher has a fee, too.  Fee, too.  This lady's so annoyed.  Oh, man.  I can't take it.  She just has to stop the interview.  She is really stupid, yes.  She calls it the Haran and the Haram. 
[02:09:30]  The Haram.  Haram and Haram.  My Haram.  Judaism worships Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Worships Jesus.  Judaism does not.  It rejects and hates and kills Jesus.  And then she finishes up with this.  NDIS, so where do you stand on that?  Do you want the National Disability Scheme?  I believe that the Disability Scheme is working at the moment.  It doesn't start until 2016.  I'd like to see the government drop its five-star budget down to an economy budget. 
[02:10:00]  With the way the economy is going at the moment,  I don't see why the government feels that it should remain at a five-star budget  when economy is just as good.  The candidate is facing criminal charges accused of plastering anti-Muslim stickers like  halal food funds terrorism on Nestle products at a supermarket in Logan.  The Electoral Commission will decide if Mrs. Bannister can run.  Candidates are disqualified if they've been convicted or about to be sentenced to jail. 
[02:10:30]  Jail.  She's about to reappear in court.  The seat the mother wants stretches from Regent's Park to Rochedale South with opponents like...  I'm still learning all the names of people in politics.  Still learning all the names.  She doesn't know.  She doesn't know who she's running against?  Oh my god.  Why is this a story, though?  Because she is running.  Right.  But she simply couldn't know less.  Yeah, but it's the goof ticket.  No one really pays attention to the goof ticket.  She's wrong about literally everything. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  Yes, yes, yes.  Even the basics.  Right.  The very basics.  Judaism.  Wow, thang.  She called it the Haram.  The Haram.  It's the Koran.  Or the Haram.  No, I don't think...  No, it's never called that?  It's Haram.  She thinks Islam is a country.  The country of Islam, right?  Why, they're Islamic.  Isn't that where Islamic come from?  They come from somewhere, don't they, Sam?  She is a dummy.  Hey, good for her.  Who gives a shit about the fucking...  Why do you have to know about Islam anyway?  If you're anti-Islam, you should know about Islam. 
[02:11:30]  Why?  Because you have to know what you're against.  Otherwise, it's just blind racism.  I'm more for hatred without the knowledge.  Yeah?  Yeah, just blind hatred.  Okay.  It's easier that way.  You gotta learn, and then you might not hate it as much if you know about it, so...  I'd rather just hate.  Like, even though she couldn't back anything up, you were kind of with her on some of the points.  Oh, yeah, like the Haram, and the Jays, and Jaysus.  Right.  Jaysus. 
[02:12:00]  The Jays?  Well, the Jews read the Haram?  Well, they read the...  I think so.  The Torah, the Torah, Torah, Torah.  The Ratar?  And they reject Jesus, those people.  Yes, they do.  The Jews?  Yes, they do.  Ah, nice.  The Jews hate Jesus.  Hate him.  Hate Jesus.  They hung him on a cross for him to suffer and die.  Oh, thanks. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, really.  I don't think it was an anti-Jew spin that they were taking in this story.  No, I don't think you were listening.  The woman's stupid.  Oh.  Oh.  By the way, when we were talking about dumb people, and we were going with political dumb people,  we forgot good old Hank Johnson.  Of course.  Hank.  Hank.  Hank.  Oh, come on.  We've got to play the clip again now, too.  Maybe the dumbest.  What's the dumbest?  Was he the guy that was running against...  I have the clip, if you want. 
[02:13:00]  How long is the clip?  A minute 13.  You sure it's not 13 minutes?  It could be.  I could play something with it.  Let's put it in context.  We are so in vacation mode.  Well, it happens.  We haven't taken a week off since, I think...  Fan was excited to meet Kobe.  I don't know.  We got that?  Why?  Kobe fan loses it on air.  I don't know.  It looked like some Asian kid who was like really fucking...  He was crying and shit.  I was telling you to wear... 
[02:13:30]  Oh, that's...  Right outside our building.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Fox & Friends has their All-American Summer Music Festival going on.  That no one goes to.  No one goes to.  Although it's a country act today, so there's more people.  Yeah.  There he is.  Who is this guy?  Oh, my God.  What about Hank Johnson?  Oh, we'll get to him.  All right.  Fair enough.  What's this?  Kobe Bryant reduces adult fan to tears.  Oh, please.  He was in Shenzhen.  I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.  Oh.  And this guy saw him. 
[02:14:00]  Kobe's walking around China?  China?  Wow.  He must really fit in.  He's freaking out a lot of people.  18 feet tall and black.  Right.  He's like a 15-year-old James. 
[02:14:30]  The news knew how funny that was.  They just put that on to make fun of him.  They didn't even bother finding a translator or anything.  Nothing.  No.  Who cares what he's saying?  Look at this funny guy crying.  They're like, look, he's got a funny little face.  He's funny crying.  He's saying funny words.  Looks like that guy from 16 Candles.  Hilarious.  Yes.  Play him again.  Let me hear his little funny voice. 
[02:15:00]  Love his funny voice.  He's fucking, people don't know he's actually saying he was over last night.  He raped my mom in the ass.  Jesus.  Wow.  Kobe got past all that.  It could happen.  You still don't know Hank Johnson?  Hank Johnson.  You know Hank Johnson? 
[02:15:30]  Was he an intern?  Now I know we have to play the clip again because you don't remember who Hank Johnson is.  I know.  I don't.  He's the dumbest guy alive.  Yeah, for sure.  Unless someone could give me one that's dumber.  But it's got to be backed up with something.  He's a politician?  Yes.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Can you play the Hank Johnson clip?  Play some Hank Johnson.  To your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.  Very small island and about 24 miles, if I recall, long. 
[02:16:00]  So 24 miles long, about 7 miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about  20, about 12 miles wide on the widest part of the island and I don't know how many square  miles that that is.  Do you happen to know?  I don't have that figure with me, sir. 
[02:16:30]  I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like.  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip  over and capsize.  We don't anticipate that.  The Guam population, I think, currently about 175,000 and again with 8,000 Marines and their  families, it's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population. 
[02:17:00]  But this is what sucks about the...  Like, he had to say, we don't participate, we don't anticipate, sorry, we don't anticipate  that happening.  Not...  Instead of saying, what the fuck?  How do you not say, what are you talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you this stupid?  Yeah, like he should have looked...  Like, are you...  That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.  Now we're not having an adult conversation, sir.  I'm sorry.  Because you probably are the dumbest person I've ever fucking... 
[02:17:30]  I've ever met.  In his defense, I have heard other clips of him.  Right.  He could have been very dry and sarcastically goofing right there.  I really think...  Really?  I'm not sure...  I've never seen a write-up where they say that.  I know, I know.  I...  Wow, you're defending a black guy.  Fucking mark it down.  Is he a Republican?  Mark to stay down.  What?  Is he a Republican, sir? 
[02:18:00]  Why do you think that?  I don't...  Because it's so stupid that...  It's so ridiculous.  It's so ridiculous.  But I hear...  Well, you're sitting there going, there's no way an adult male would actually think that.  Is there another one like...  It says giants need midgets.  But Ireland...  Okay.  That's a half hour long.  Yeah.  Um...  I saw another clip in the same delivery.  Very dry.  Not a hint of humor.  And he said it in a way... 
[02:18:30]  Something else that was completely ridiculous.  Well, I'm building my amazing list.  So far on the list is water.  Oh.  Anthony Comia.  And magnets.  Magnets and water are amazing.  I'm going to add islands to that.  Islands?  Yeah, because all of a sudden...  Like, you ever go to Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard?  Yeah.  You take a ferry and all of a sudden you're in the water for a long time.  And all of a sudden it's like...  What?  What the...  What the fuck?  How is that possible?  An island? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, a little piece of fucking land.  No, nowhere.  It's the top of a mountain underwater.  No.  That's it.  No.  You just think they're floating there?  Yeah, it's not a mountain because you could go in the water and you don't go over your head right away.  That's a very gradual mountain.  I'm going to add islands to my amazing list.  All right.  I'm not going to be against it.  God damn it.  Is that a big bitch?  I agree.  She is fucking huge.  Oh my God.  She's huge.  In every way.  Not just fat.  She looks like Violet Beauregard after she ate the gum. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  Great weekend, guys.  Good to see you.  Happening now in the CNN News.  Wow, she's a big bitch.  Happening now?  Nothing's happening now.  Floodwaters.  Fires.  Tornado.  Earthquake.  And orange stuff falling from the sky.  Fucking planes just dropping that.  And Powerball.  Powerball.  That guy that won is a real regular Joe kind of guy.  Finally?  Yeah, just a regular Joe.  Blue collar type guy.  Blue collar worker guy. 
[02:20:00]  Very psyched that he won.  There's three winners.  Yeah, but no one cares about the other ones.  I think one of the winners was like a fuckload of people that worked together and they got  to split it.  They got like 86 bucks each or something.  Why would you do that?  I know.  How hard is it to buy lottery tickets that you have to do with everybody in the office?  Yeah.  Why would you just go and buy your own fucking lottery tickets?  I don't know.  How many people won on that one ticket?  Like, I know three tickets won.  Right.  But I think on one ticket there was something like, and I'm not kidding, I think I heard 
[02:20:30]  86 people.  Oh, God.  It's good to be one of those 86, but you've got to be thinking, I should have got my own  fucking ticket.  Is it that many?  Wait, it sounds like 34, 36.  Travis came down the hallway, which means he's got to fill us in with basic knowledge.  Travis knows everything.  We should get Travis a fedora with a note in it, card in it that says press.  Because he's always got the information.  He's always got the scoop.  I got the scoop.  I know the scuttlebutt.  Yeah.  It was 16 garage workers. 
[02:21:00]  16.  16 guys have to split a third of the pot.  16 people have to split a third.  And you know that they probably took the lump sum.  So I think the lump sum was 53 million, so they're splitting 53 million 16 ways.  Oh, how could you live on that?  That's so great.  Yeah, it's great.  This Minnesota guy rules, though.  He's exactly the type of person that, like...  Should win the lottery.  Should win, yeah.  Like, he was talking in the press conference, you know, like, he's the type of person that  always daydreams about what he would do if he won the lottery.  Yeah, regular Joe. 
[02:21:30]  And, you know, he's quitting his job.  He's not working anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  He waited, what, two hours before coming forward, you know?  Like, he hasn't even spoken to, like, a financial planner or anything.  Came right forward, yeah.  Here I am.  He's the type of guy.  What do you need?  Here I am.  Yeah.  Who needs money?  Where's my big giant check with my name on it?  Give me the giant check.  Come on.  He's an electrical contractor.  Of course he was.  He's upset that he's got to wait two weeks for his money.  He's got to wait two weeks. 
[02:22:00]  We only had to deal with one giant check in our lives.  Oh, God, that's right.  The Bruce Mittman giant check.  The one we gave to the...  Where he was standing behind the check and we didn't even know because we couldn't see him anymore because he was that short.  Remember?  Yeah.  He was going downtown with the giant check for another photo op to try to save our asses.  For the African-American Vietnam disabled veterans.  Did he jump out of the bushes with the big check?  Hey!  He came in.  He was always annoyed.  He loved us.  You know, it has to be said, Bruce Mittman loved us. 
[02:22:30]  He was a cheap fuck that really took advantage of us because we didn't know shit back then and paid us way less than we were worth at the time.  And he was always going for photo ops to save our ass.  And he was a huge golfer because he had a really good radio show and me and Ann.  So he didn't...  It was on autopilot.  So he was able to leave the office early, get a round in.  But then it was those days where he was so mad.  And he's like, I've got to go downtown and deal with the shwoogies. 
[02:23:00]  Well, you're out.  I should be working on my slice today and I'm dealing with the shwoogies.  I never heard the word shwoogies until Bruce Mittman told us that he had to go and give the check to the shwoogies.  The shwoogies.  And then you guys, right when I put out the fire with the shwoogies, you've got to screw things up with the faggots.  Can you imagine a human being saying that?  I have to go deliver this check to the shwoogies.  To the shwoogies.  Bruce Mittman ruled.  I mean, we exaggerated his height, but he was probably barely five... 
[02:23:30]  Five...  In a giant SUV.  And he drove the biggest fucking...  A suburban, the biggest thing you get fined at the time.  Yeah.  He looked ridiculous behind the wheel.  So we're doing our afternoon drive show.  He comes in with the giant check and goes, we're going to deliver this to the shwoogies.  Now I have to meet with the fagglars because of you two.  Well, that was the...  That was the other one.  That was the gay meeting we had to have.  Yay.  Just completely intolerant behind closed doors.  Well, as soon as the gays left, then he's like, all right, don't listen to any of that shit. 
[02:24:00]  Go back and do your thing.  They fucking gave us literature.  They wanted us to attend some kind of a sensitivity meeting thing.  And Bruce was like, no.  Not the company.  No, no, no.  The fagglars.  That's why Bruce was so cool.  He got it.  He knew, all right, we've got to come...  Right when they started really talking about that.  We've got to calm these guys down.  Yep.  I can't imagine that.  What?  Like, you know, the special interest group bringing this and then the company behind closed doors  having your back and everything.  Totally.  That's just not the world we live in.  As these guys are pouring out their hearts and souls to us, there's Bruce in the background 
[02:24:30]  kind of winking, like, just, you know, hanging there.  It's almost done.  And then when we were sitting there at one point, they said, they went like, and you guys,  maybe this weekend you can attend this thing.  No, he wanted us to read a book.  Read a book or something.  And then report back to him.  Yes, and Bruce immediately got up.  He was like, look, that isn't going to happen.  Right, right.  Like, told them, no, that isn't going to happen.  I think we got some good things done here today, but this is over.  Now fucking sashay your ass out of my fucking office.  Yeah, our overall hate for management, we didn't just pull that out of thin air. 
[02:25:00]  Things used to be different.  When did it start?  Was any W good with management?  Yeah, pretty much, because we were our bosses.  Dave Dickless was, he gave us some shit.  That was the very beginnings of, but it was a different type of management asshole.  It wasn't like corporate guy asshole.  It was just individual asshole.  You're a dick asshole.  But wasn't Dave Dickless the one that also wanted you guys to be like, all right, buddy,  you got it.  And you would lie to him every time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just wanted to be your friends. 
[02:25:30]  Guys, maybe we could lay a little bit off of the gay jokes for a while until things blow  over, all right, okay, we'll do that.  We get on the air, and it's like, so, this fucking cocksucker is right next to him.  It's like, I told you, just this morning, I was telling you guys.  Damn it, guys.  I got to fill in a couple blanks.  That all went down.  And we would leave his office convincing him that we really learned our lesson.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I pictured Dave in his office like, I really think I broke through to those guys 
[02:26:00]  today.  And he's probably like, that's how you manage.  Right, and he probably pushed his chest out and walked and talked to Bruce Mayman, the  general manager, like, I really think I got through to him today.  I got through to him.  You know, let's listen to our first break, because I really feel good about our discussion.  So he's turning the first break out in front of his boss.  Right, and then all of a sudden, you know he's turning beet red immediately.  Then he marches down the hall.  Oh, he's just yelling at us.  And then he would start, he would open the door and start, you know, don't we talk about  this.  Remember this one? 
[02:26:30]  And then I would go, and I love this shit for real.  So I would go, oh, like I had a realization, like, oh, I thought you meant, and I would  just have some bullshit answer, like, oh, shit, that's what you were saying?  We didn't even touch what you were talking about.  This is something else.  Like, you're just a couple of morons.  Remember when he'd open the door and he was beet red and he would go, really?  Really, guys?  Really?  And we'd be like, what? 
[02:27:00]  Everything was a mystery.  We didn't understand anything.  We'd be like, what?  That's good stuff, I would say a lot.  Oh, that was it.  What?  That's good stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, he was like, what?  That's good stuff.  I think it's even on the Da Da Dave production.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good stuff.  I said that to him all the time.  What?  That's good stuff.  He'd go, no more.  What about the time when you would leave the studio?  There was that weird, dark hallway, because it was like, there was a dark hallway, because  it had two other studios.  And then you'd open the other door and it would go out into brightness and office space  and lunchroom.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Remember, you would kind of hide?  He would hide in there.  And you would open the door and maybe go to the bathroom and get a cup of coffee.  He'd be there.  He'd be there.  I'm like, ah!  It's like Slender Man.  It's very fucking evil.  Because he'd tell you guys no more gay jokes.  And you'd be like, you got it.  And then you'd go in the air and call him gay.  No, we purposely.  And in our defense, we knew Bruce Mimmon had our back no matter what.  So he was just a clown to us.  We knew he had no power because Bruce Mimmon loved us so much. 
[02:28:00]  So we purposely would do exactly what he told us not to do every single time.  Yeah.  Every time.  Every fucking time.  And then he just eventually, he kind of just started leaving us alone as far as, like,  he didn't even want to take us into meetings.  That's my favorite reaction, though.  Because, like, he wanted to be your buddy, and you guys just lied to his face.  Yeah.  The, come on, guys!  Come on!  Guys, really?  Guys, we just talked about this.  No, not this.  That sentiment. 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  The, I can't believe we just talked about this and you betrayed me again.  I fell for it again.  And we'd fall for it every single time.  And I'm like, what?  Because we understood.  All innocent stuff.  What?  We understood so well in the meeting.  Right.  He's like, there's no way they didn't get it.  They're telling me exactly what I want to hear.  Because not only are you now, you're doing something you're not supposed to be doing,  but you're also going out of your way to make a fool out of that guy.  In direct contradiction of what was said.  It just made it more fun to do it that way.  Instead of argue the point, I'm like, oh, okay, yeah, we see. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, you know, okay.  You'd agree with them and then do the opposite.  I don't win!  We just talked about this!  He would be like, not this.  We just talked about this.  I heard that a million times.  We just talked about this!  No.  That was a story about gay guys having oral sex with each other.  This is about them fucking each other in the ass, Dave.  It's totally different.  I thought the problem was the oral sex.  The oral sex part. 
[02:29:30]  That's what you said, Dave.  You know what I meant.  No, I swear, we fucking, we...  But I do now, but I'm sorry, Dave.  We know now.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  But anyway, then, Bruce, a different incident, came in with the big check.  The only time we dealt with the big check is we're talking about Powerball, where he  had to deliver to the Shwoogies and get a big photo op.  And what that was about was everyone thought we were the scourge of society up there in  Boston before we pulled the Mayor's Prank.  And we put out a CD, Demented World, which, you know what, I'm still proud of for the 
[02:30:00]  most part.  Yeah.  Some cool tracks on there still.  Hard to find.  We should just fucking, like, re-release it or...  Get it up on iTunes.  Yeah.  I could do that.  What happens then?  If you own it, you get it up on iTunes, you sell it.  I don't think we own it, but I don't know who owns it.  It's one of those weird, gray things.  It's probably in fucking the same category as, like, I've been working on the railroad  now.  The public domain.  It's like fucking, yeah, happy birthday and fucking, she'll be coming around the mountain. 
[02:30:30]  You could put the whole thing up on SoundCloud, but you're not going to make any money.  SoundCloud!  Sounds like some futuristic place.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind a little.  That Cloud City?  I wouldn't mind a little.  Lando Calrissian.  Lando Calrissian is up on the cloud.  I haven't done any SoundCloud lately.  I used to like doing my little SoundCloud shit.  I'll do more.  You shouldn't include.  It's a soon include.  I think I'm Opie Radio and SoundCloud, too.  So, Opie Radio crossed the board.  Instagram, almost 25,000 followers. 
[02:31:00]  Let's get that done this weekend, people.  Please.  Anyway, so, we put out the CD.  We're looked at as the scourge of fucking Boston.  Bruce Mimmon has to, like, socialize with these people, and he loved a good cocktail party.  Did he enjoy hobbing and knobbing with the Boston elite?  So, his thought was, well, if I could kind of bring these guys up a little bit and show,  you know, that they're truly good guys in the end, I'm going to have a better cocktail party.  He was constantly trying to present us as gentlemen, and we constantly fucked it up. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  We were like the fucking sluts at the debutante ball.  You just would never play nice.  Never.  Why couldn't you just, for one second.  For once.  Exactly.  For once.  Because that was just boring, especially back then.  Oh, we'd fuck everything up.  So, it was a good opportunity.  We put out this CD, and it did really, really well.  And we barely made any money off it.  And they decided, let's have a charity angle, because that'll make you guys look like good guys.  I'm like, all right, whatever. 
[02:32:00]  If it buys us a few more months on radio, for sure.  Why not?  Because I never thought this would last this long.  And so, then we're looking at charities.  No one would take our money.  To this day, it's one of the things that really amazes me, that there are charities out there  that will not take money from certain individuals, because they're scumbags.  You'd think.  So, they would rather sacrifice their own cause.  They're worried more about the branding of the organization than the actual.  Than take, like, money from scumbags. 
[02:32:30]  It's not even like we have a prison record, anything.  No criminal record or anything.  They just deemed us as asshole scumbags, so they couldn't take our money.  The Jimmy Fund, we wanted to give it to.  Well, that's the big one.  That is the big one.  Which is a huge charity up there for cancer kids.  It's like, you don't want our money.  You'd rather have children, maybe not get the care they need, children with cancer, than take our money.  And I think it was up there.  I think it was like a dollar a CD, and we did well over a hundred thousand. 
[02:33:00]  A couple hundred thousand were sold.  There's no chump change.  And they said no to that.  Could have bought them a lot of kerchiefs for their little cold heads.  True.  Those little kids.  So then Bruce was like, ah, don't worry about the Jimmy Fund.  We'll find someone just as good.  Now we get to the shwuggies.  We finally found an organization that would take our money.  And it was, do you know exactly what it was called?  Well, it's on the back of the CD.  It wasn't it?  African-American disabled Vietnam veterans.  Yes.  A little niche.  But, um... 
[02:33:30]  It was a little niche.  Just the black disabled vets?  Just black disabled vets from Vietnam.  Because I think the white Vietnam disabled vets didn't want our money either.  So we had to go all the way to black.  Like, fuck it.  I don't need an arm.  Right.  Who cares?  Agent Orange, I don't give a shit.  Not from you.  No, not from Opie and Anthony.  That was the only charity that would take our money.  So there you go with the big check with Bruce Mittman.  Maybe I'll give it to the shwuggies.  I present to the shwuggies this check for $100,000. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  He was one of the greatest characters in our careers.  Do you have anyone literate enough to endorse the back of this check, shwuggies?  He'd go backstage and smoke dope with the jocks.  Bruce ruled.  Yeah.  He fucking ruled.  He was a fun guy.  Did he ever get mad at you for exposing his off-air antics?  No, he loved when we talked about him.  He loved it.  Even when you brought up the shwuggies and stuff?  Uh, I don't know.  He didn't really care. 
[02:34:30]  He called me a few Christmases ago.  That's the last I heard from him.  I hope he's doing well.  Me too.  We should get him on the phone.  He really is a quintessential character in this universe.  Let me see something.  Hold on a minute.  People still call you.  I guarantee you still listen to us.  B-b-b-boys.  I know.  I hate when they do that.  You do, right?  You don't do it right.  No.  Because nobody remembers the context of it.  No.  All these guys listening.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  B-b-b-boys. 
[02:35:00]  Hold on a minute.  Uh.  My slice.  My hook needs a little work.  Could you please watch my children while I go out and play some golf?  Oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  We'd have to babysit his kids.  He would literally drop his young children.  Impressionable.  What would they fucking like?  13.  I think his daughter was 13.  His son was younger, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like fucking 12 or 11 or something.  And just dump them on the chairs in our studio. 
[02:35:30]  And we'd have to fucking do a show.  A filthy show.  Right.  And he would just fucking sit them there.  No, just hold it up to the glass, no?  That's why I wrote it so big.  What is that?  His cell number.  Let's see if we can get him on the phone.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  Boys, why are you calling me?  Uh, look, I never liked you.  I don't want to talk to you.  You know how many checks, giant checks I had to print up for you boys? 
[02:36:00]  You told everyone I called them shwoogies.  Yes.  Do you know how fucking, with the cost of giant checks.  He was the only GM that needed a giant checkbook.  My checkbook got enormous.  That was just his regular checkbook.  That's what it looked like, because he was tiny.  Just fucking, let me have control of the phone.  We don't need to do all that horse shit. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  There it is.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  No way.  Is the number disconnected?  That doesn't sound like...  Yeah, that's not a cell phone.  I'm sorry.  Your number.  Oh, my God.  You don't have Bruce's number anymore, huh?  You got a work number, but I don't know if that's going to work.  Opie, lose my number.  I had to get a new number.  The shwoogie stole my phone.  The shwoogies. 
[02:37:00]  It's a great name.  It's so innocent sounding, isn't it?  Yeah.  What's this?  Especially in that voice.  The last time you tried this, we got Craig Brady on the phone.  Opie.  All right, hold on.  We're going to call you on another line.  Hold on a minute.  Pick up again.  All right.  All right.  Cool. 
[02:37:30]  Brucey.  You know he didn't want to say that.  Opie.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Should we do it after the break, or?  Ah, let's just keep rolling.  All right.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  All right.  Here you go.  We used to put him on the air a lot back then.  Yeah.  At NAW.  I'd love to find out what he's up to.  Did you hear that?  He just.  He probably got a flashback.  Remembering being suspended and fucking. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What?  No.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have to write another check.  Oh, where's my giant checks?  Oh, should it be the Fagalas, the Shwoogies, or the Retards?  God damn.  What the fuck?  He's not answering now.  Come on.  What happened?  It keeps getting a busy signal.  The one I just called?  Are you dialing it right? 
[02:38:30]  Are you dialing nine?  Yeah.  You've got to dial nine, one, and then the number.  Nobody has a busy signal anymore.  I just called it.  Maybe you took the phone off the hook.  I won't be picking up.  Yes.  Do not answer this phone under any circumstances.  If someone calls, just answer Vandellay Industries.  Vandellay Industries.  Mars is making sure he's doing it right.  They're fucking up in there, I think.  Yeah, they are.  That's why it's busy, because it's being dialed around. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, they're not doing it right.  Yeah, something's a mess.  I'm tired of jumping out of bushes for photo ops, boys.  Yes.  I don't need this.  I finally am able to show my face in public.  We'll see how much he's willing to admit.  I never said Fagalos.  I never said Shwuggies or Fagalos.  And I certainly didn't call them retards, boys.  All right, pick up line nine.  All right, hold on a minute.  Bruce.  Yes.  Bruce.  How are you?  Bruce Mittman, you're on the air, by the way. 
[02:39:30]  You're on the air, Bruce Mittman.  We were reminiscing a little bit.  We were reminiscing about the good old days, and your name came up.  And we said, what the hell?  Let's call them up and just say hi, see what you're up to.  And just like the old days, we're not prepared for the radio show,  so the reason we're reminiscing is because we ran out of material today.  Well, that's obvious, because I've been listening occasionally,  and I recognize that you've never prepared for your radio show.  Why screw with a good thing, Bruce? 
[02:40:00]  Bruce always wanted us to prepare for our radio show.  But, by the way, I've noticed, you know, the other day I was thinking about it,  you know, because of you guys, I could never run for any public office.  And you would have loved to have done that.  Oh, God, he was built for it.  He loves being out at these events and hobnobbing.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Sorry.  And then I figured, thank God, that the FCC, since we own 16 radio stations, 
[02:40:30]  has never checked any of your videos or audio,  because then they would probably condemn me from owning radio.  We also said how we loved you, Bruce.  Yes.  Well, you know, I saw you on Hannity.  Would you get me on Hannity's show, please?  Oh, you've got things to say.  I need to express myself politically.  I don't doubt it.  But I don't want to hear any liberal drivel from you.  Liberal? 
[02:41:00]  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Bruce was.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Believe me.  Me and Bruce.  I'm on the opposite spectrum of that topic.  I will speak to my good friend, Sean Hannity,  and try to get you on the program.  You should do red-eye, too.  You look old, Anthony.  You are old.  I've got to tell you, Bruce, we've been doing this for a while.  You do realize we're, I think we're pushing 20 years now.  Do you remember?  Also, I was no kid when I got hired.  Right.  We made believe we were. 
[02:41:30]  By the way, our air conditioning here at the advertising agency.  Say.  Say.  If you wouldn't mind.  Call the guy.  Bruce, we were reminiscing about the big check for the shwoogies.  For the shwoogies.  You laugh.  See.  I said before the phone call, I don't know how much he's willing to admit.  Come on now.  You might have seen it differently, because many years have gone by.  You know, they're going to misinterpret my comedy as serious stuff now. 
[02:42:00]  That's true.  That's right.  All right.  How many things did you have to do to get us out of trouble back in the day?  That's what we were trying.  We remembered we would have to meet with the special interest groups.  We had to sit with the gay group for one time.  The gay group, and we said how cool you were.  That was the sensitivity training.  Right, right.  Sensitivity training.  Then we had where you jumped out of the bushes and shook Mayor Menino's hand.  I had a photographer on hand for that. 
[02:42:30]  Of which you didn't talk to me for three years after.  Well, you were in the competition then.  Do you realize what I had to do just to be able to drive in Boston without getting my car towed?  See?  It really was.  We put him in a tough spot.  Yeah.  You were a soldier.  And then we bought the pies for the big publicity stunt to try to save our jobs.  Oh, that's right.  And then, but people don't know that, for example, WOW, I had to kill WOW by having the state police fake a letter to me about a threat from the governor that didn't really exist. 
[02:43:00]  Oh!  But none of it was real.  Just to get you the scruff.  Wow, Bruce!  Wow, he's admitting something today.  That's a good one.  But we never knew that.  But WOW really took off when we came to New York.  Yeah.  They were willing to accept it down here.  Unlike Bruce Mittman, who shut it down. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, I know, I know.  I was a bad guy.  I mean, you know, thank God you went to New York and then the church shut you down.  Yeah.  You had to think we were never going to learn.  Maybe we could get you, Bruce would have been great in that situation.  Maybe we could get you out of trouble.  We'll ask if maybe the Pope wants to throw rosary beads over your heads from a distance like a ring toss.  By the way, Glenn Lucas just walked by.  You know, Glenn Lucas.  Oh, yes, Glenn. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  Yes, and he says hi.  He just waved.  Tell him hello.  He's like, oh, God.  Remember Glenn?  Remember the big event?  The mayor was going to throw pies at us?  Yeah.  To save our jobs?  Oh, yes.  That worked out really well for about eight minutes.  He didn't go for that one.  And that was not your idea, Bruce.  I know that.  Well, you know what?  I have to admit it was my stupid idea.  But here's the best part about this whole thing.  I don't think your listeners have any clue.  I get suspended and lose one month of salary. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  And you guys go off and sign a multi-million.  You should have paid us more.  My family still curses your name.  My family still curses.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, Bruce is suspended.  We leave him in Boston.  Where he has to now live among these people, and we're gone.  We're in the big city lights of Broadway signing huge fucking deals.  We see the skyline of Boston in our rearview mirror, and he has to deal with everybody. 
[02:45:00]  And I'm not allowed to walk in my office for a month without police escort.  The fucking destruction in our wake was terrible back then.  What a fun, innocent time that was.  It sure was, innocent.  Oh, different animal back then, the radio business.  Wow, I like hearing his perspective on these things.  I thought everything was all right.  Hunky-dory.  Yeah.  Not quite.  I wish you guys could do some of our radio stations, but, you know, since you're on Sirius now, you know, you've become invisible, of course. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, there it is.  But the checks have it.  Can I borrow some money?  No kidding.  I think we owe you a month's salary.  God, we would go on your stations in a second.  I know.  That would be a blast.  What do you got these days?  Well, we own five markets in Watertown, New York, home of the 10th Mountain Division. 
[02:46:00]  Three in Ogdensburg, New York, five in Elmira Corning, and two in Olean, New York.  All in upstate New York.  Upstate New York stations, huh?  Hmm.  Wow.  You know what?  We'll have you on sometime.  That would be fun.  That would be.  Do we need to pay you or anything?  I mean, do we need to pay you?  Well, we'll do a little charity.  Yeah, well, maybe for the shwoogies.  We'll donate our pay.  You do remember the giant check, right?  That you were so annoyed because you wanted to play golf that day? 
[02:46:30]  There's a picture of it on eBay for sale.  Wow.  Come on.  Is there really?  The check is for sale?  Yeah, I saw it the other day.  My son sent me a photo.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Of that photo on eBay.  Wow.  Damn.  Do you miss the old days, Bruce, when AF was really happening?  I do because it was fun.  It was a great time.  It really was.  The music was very cool and everybody working there was great. 
[02:47:00]  Ozone and stuff.  I mean, we were doing things that nobody else was doing in the country.  That probably was one of the best rock stations ever.  I try to tell people and they just don't care.  Yeah, no, they don't care.  No, I'm serious.  I go, you don't understand.  We were breaking bands and doing radio no one else was doing.  I know.  But, no, you know, the problem is that radio just never got that notoriety that other media does.  And so you tell people and they go, oh, yeah, that's cool.  Yeah.  Can you pass the mustard? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, that's true.  And now no one takes any chances out there.  No, no, well, you can't.  I mean, you know, it's so PC out there.  It's just ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Right.  Damn ridiculous how PC out there.  You got the satellite, Bruce.  Yes, I do.  I listen to you guys occasionally in the morning.  I must admit.  Oh, nice.  All right.  I like hearing that.  No, we never know when.  Are you part?  Let me see.  Somebody called me to tell me that you were talking about me getting into my Tahoe in a ladder. 
[02:48:00]  Well, we said you had a rope ladder.  The big suburban, right, to get in and out of it.  That was a big suburban there, Bruce.  We think you were 5'5".  So when I come to New York and I come into morning drive, I'm going to be there Monday.  Can I come in?  I swear we're on vacation next week.  Yeah.  You know, he was my big chance.  I know, right?  Bruce, are you buying the Boston Globe?  Well, no comment.  No, I didn't buy it.  John Henry did, though. 
[02:48:30]  I thought you were involved with that.  Well, I was with Ernie Bach, Jr.  Right.  Wow.  And we were going to make a run at it, but, you know, no comment.  No comment.  No comment.  Oh, no comment.  Oh, no comment.  Oh, wheeling and dealing.  Bruce, it is always wheeling and dealing.  Bruce is great.  I have to make up on the income.  I have to make up on the income.  Because that makes sense these days.  What?  I have to make up on the income.  I have to make up on the income. 
[02:49:00]  I have to try to make up for all the income I lost because of you guys.  Income you lost.  I think you got a few shots in.  You took advantage of us a little bit.  You got a few good years out of us for the...  And a very cheap salary.  The pittance that you slid across the paper at the Chinese place that day.  The Chinese buffet.  See, he's laughing.  He knows.  And we laughed at you that day.  I remember that.  And that's the day my wheels started turning, by the way.  Every time I pass that Chinese restaurant, I have to laugh. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  How are the kids that we used to babysit?  How old are they now?  Oh, well, you know, Andrew's a producer out in Hollywood.  Right.  Is he doing well?  Yeah, he's doing great.  He's in the middle of three...  He works for a company called Berman Braun.  He runs all of their feature film group.  Wow.  How old is he now?  He's 30 already. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm not kidding.  He was a kid.  Bruce would drop his actual kids off and say,  Can you watch him for an hour or two?  I got to go do whatever he had to do.  There was no better babysitting service than the two of you.  Well, how twisted are you?  How twisted are you?  Because when the mics were off, we really talked some shit.  And there's your young kids in the room.  Your babysitters were shock jocks.  Right.  Do you know that...  That's right.  Do you know that...  Do your listeners understand how many times I walked into your studio 
[02:50:30]  and there were women completely nude  turning around speaking to me in their vagina saying,  Hello.  Those were the days, right?  I noticed you had a lot of excuses why you needed to be in the studio, too.  Oh, remember that?  They used to come down the hall like,  Hey, we haven't seen you in a while.  What's up?  I'm checking on the traffic, making sure that...  I got to check the traffic log.  Yes.  I'm staring at a picture with Green Day in my office, 
[02:51:00]  and nobody knows how stoned they were when they took that picture.  Oh, I remember that day they came in.  Well, that was the day they destroyed our studio.  And actually, Bruce was cool with it.  He's like, yeah, man, that was a cool moment.  Yeah.  I remember.  It was a cool moment.  Come on.  They threw the tombstone through the wall.  All I know is that they're smoking pot in a studio  that has a halogen system,  which would suck all the air.  And then one of them picked up a tombstone,  and it was a real tombstone.  I don't even know the story behind that. 
[02:51:30]  That might be before us.  And they threw it through the sheetrock.  Yeah, through the wall.  They were out of their minds.  That was fun, though.  What happened with Rocco, man?  He just had...  His health was bad.  I think he died.  He had diabetes.  Yeah.  And I think he...  Yeah, poor Rocco.  We loved him.  Dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sad.  Hillman.  Hillman's doing really well up in Boston.  Oh, shit.  You fucking... 
[02:52:00]  Oh, no.  There's the reunion.  Reunion over.  Reunion over.  You can't just let it go nicely.  Because it's reunion over.  That was the one thing.  You think Bruce is laughing right now  with the phone in his hand?  Oh, he tried to play both ways.  Hillman and Opie and Anthony.  You know...  You know, we...  Hillman was...  Hillman was doing very well.  Hillman was barely nice to us. 
[02:52:30]  Barely.  And I guess they had a guy on the show,  Kevin Barbary,  who's a very talented, funny guy.  Yeah, he's trying to work here or something.  He writes me,  but I don't know what we could do for him.  I know.  He was always cool to us.  Very cool.  LB was always cool to us,  but Hillman was not so much.  And then I guess they just booted him out of there.  Barbary.  Yeah, he's a talented kid.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's not a kid anymore, but...  Who is?  Maybe, uh...  Maybe...  Not even fucking Bruce.  These kids aren't even kids.  No, obviously.  30. 
[02:53:00]  All right, we got to take a break,  because we got to wrap up before vacation.  Yes.  Say goodbye to Jackie proper.  There's Kevin.  In a proper way.  You got to take a break  so you can clear the field  to say goodbye to your intern properly?  Yes.  Reunion over.  This is sad.  Insanity.  Reunion over.  Reunion over.  The Opie and Anthony Show  on Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show

[02:54:30]  To get a better gig in New York  Cause we were very frustrated  By the, uh  Lack of pay  Yeah  And we had some suitors in New York  So we said, fuck it  Let's just blow it up  Exactly  Not knowing at the time  That we were leaving him behind  To clean up the mess  Ka-boom  To this day  He's looking over  Looking over his back  And he lost a month's pay  And we go to New York  Oh, boy  Never missed a beat  Sorry, Mittman  Sorry, Brucey  Where's Jackie?

Yes, he is  Is he cool?  Because Sidney's boyfriend  You know  Yeah  He didn't give off a cool vibe  He would be nice  He might be a good guy  He wouldn't come in  And be like  You're all lazy  He'd be like him  Yeah  We heard Sidney's boyfriend  Was, as Iraq said 
[02:57:30]  A dick  Oh, really?  Yeah  So, yeah  We don't want that  For Jackie  No  He's a great guy  Is he a great guy?

[02:58:30]  Do you guys argue a lot?  Mom-daughter arguments  You know, they're typical  But, yeah  Me too  She's, um  She's got a strong will  We'll just say it that way  Oh, it's very independent  Very independent  Yeah  And a lot of clothes  And a lot of clothes  Yeah, yeah  A lot of clothes  She went the whole summer  Without, uh, you know  Repeat  Without a repeat  Yeah  That's pretty impressive  It is  It is  I own two pairs of jeans  She's the one I get it from  Oh, yeah  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah  She is a lot of clothes  Clothes diva  So, how's the, uh 
[02:59:00]  How's the Jackie Dad thing?  What's he all about?  The Jackie Dad thing is great  Jackie is her father's baby  Oh, nice  Yeah  I wasn't  I was a mistake, basically  Oh, really?

[02:59:30]  Whoops  Yep  And I cried for nine months  Wow  I  Holy shit, you're not supposed to be here  How cool is this?  I know  And he even cut his shit  Oh, yeah  Oh, my God  I know  Just slipped one past the goalie  Right at the last minute  Holy fuck  Wow  Really?  It's not nice when you're young  Right at the buzzer  Your sister throws it in your face  Right at the buzzer  God, we would have had  We would have had a real sad summer  No one even wanted you  Exactly  Aw, that's kind of sad 
[03:00:00]  And you cried for how long?  I cried the whole time  The whole time  Nine months  Why not three?  I mean, two, three  It's pretty much the same  I wanted a third child  And my husband said no  We went on vacation  There was a lot of little kids there  And I came home  And I'm like, uh-uh  I am so good  Oh, no  I sold everything  Got rid of all the baby stuff  Set him off to make sure we were done  But now you couldn't imagine  Being without her, though  I know, exactly  We're like twins 
[03:00:30]  You look exactly alike  And you and the hubby  All good, right?  28 years  All good  That's a long time  What's the secret to a long marriage?  Please tell us the secret to your success  We don't actually live together during the week  There you go  That'll do it  Is that true?  That is true  Why?  He's got a job somewhere else?  Yeah  He's out near Albany  And I'm in Rochester  Wow  That would make it better  Yeah  No, I shouldn't say that  Because he's probably listening right now 
[03:01:00]  Oh, no  He's in a meeting, actually  He told me  So  Do you guys know  The horrible questions  You subjected my mother to?  No  Is there any thought of that?  Remembering that?  No  Yeah, no, no  I admit it  I would  That's a little edgy  No  That's a little edgy  No, no  No  Not even close  Not even close  Oh, it was pretty  Yeah  Jackie's gotten some  Very  She's been treated very well here  Yeah  On her internship  And Sam  Like every intern that's come before her 
[03:01:30]  Yes  No, just turn Sidney  Sam was an intern  When he started with us  Years and years ago  Many, many years ago  And he's resentful  That we finally decided  Perhaps it's time  We treat the interns  A little better than we have been  I don't understand why  He's so angry with that  There's a third member  Of the intern class  That is still treated  Like the old regime  Speaking of which  He happens to be a boy  But speaking of which  Have him come in  Have him come in  Have him come in  So he could share in this joy 
[03:02:00]  Actually, he's coming in with  Jackie's cake  Oh  There it is  Yay  The cake  That's Jackie's  Thank you  I think he's interning too  We're not really sure  Isn't this terrible  That twice  He's had to bring balloons  And cake in  For other interns  That are leaving  And knowing  He will not get the same  When he leaves  It's going to be  Bon voyage  Sunny boy  Whatever your name is  Yeah, whatever your name is  Right  Oh, is this a good cake? 
[03:02:30]  What does it say?  Yeah, we  Wow, what does the cake say?  I told him  I told him to write  Something very nice  No, Sam  Sam told me yesterday  He asked if he could do  A little funny  What does it say?  Mean joke  And I said  That goes against  What I wanted  How dare you  Now you  I mean  Roland said  Okay, what should we  Make the cake say?  So I said  I'll tell you exactly  What the cake should say  And what does it say?  Jackie, this is  Completely ridiculous  Oh, no  What are you talking about?  It is ridiculous 
[03:03:00]  That you're leaving  It is  Very good, Sam  Sam  No  It's the perfect cake, Sam  No  Why would we want  To get rid of someone  That is so good?  That's ridiculous  That's not what I meant  No, that's  It's absolutely what he meant  I think so  Good choice of words, Sam  And we loved both our interns this summer  Three  But we might have liked Jackie a little bit more  And with that, we got Ryan Starr outside the studio  Oh, yes  Oh, you get a little more than Jackie 
[03:03:30]  You get a little more than  Ryan  A little more than Sidney  Where's Ryan?  Yeah, cut that up  Cut that cake up  You know  Ryan  Come on  There he is  Ryan Starr, everybody  Ryan  What's up?  What's up?  That's Jackie  And Jackie's mom  And Jackie's mom  How you doing, Jackie?  Good, how are you?  Jackie's our intern  And she's leaving  Where you going?  We're devastated  At home  Mama  Mama  Ryan Starr shaved his head  What the hell?  Wow  New image  You know  Jesus

He's an EP called Animals  Yes, EP called Animals  He's doing it all himself  He said, fuck the record company  Nice  That's what people are doing now  Right  You know  Screw them shysters  They get in the way of the shave in the head  And the vision  You know what I mean?  Right  I could never do this on a corporate, you know  No, they would  A corporate watch  You cut your hair?  God forbid  That was in page number 623 of the contract 
[03:04:30]  Oh, I missed that one  And a guitar  Yeah  Could you like serenade Jackie on our last day?  Because, you know, Sidney got to send off with just a song  Right  We decided Jackie really went over the top  Why not get Ryan Starr to serenade you on your last day here?  Yes, please, Ryan, if you will  What are you talking about?  Ryan, do you have a sweet song, maybe?  A sweet song for Jackie  And Jackie's mom  Who's very, very doable  Jackie  I mean, who's a very nice lady 
[03:05:00]  The best intern ever  I gotta say  It's always interesting on the road  Because it's fitting your mom is here  Because I've been at shows where moms are holding signs of  Like, I don't know why moms are there  But they say my daughter just turned 18 or whatever  Oh, man  It's really  It's wacky out there  It is like an offering  Yes  And you never know  And then it's funny  Because I'm getting  You know, I'm in my 30s now  So it's not like  I'm 18  So it's weird 
[03:05:30]  So I can't tell  Who I'm supposed to be attracted to  The 40-year-old mom  Or like  Oh, man  See?  Go both ways  My friends say both  Oh, both ways  Yeah, both  Jackie, you shouldn't talk like that  Very good  No, no  It's a good thing your mom's here  This is for Jackie  Amazing  Jump right into a nice little send valve song  Yeah  This is for Jackie  On our last day  Should I hear the chorus?  Should we just get right to the point?  Yeah, this is  Clock's marching at the double time 
[03:06:00]  Every dollar has become a dime  Heart's breaking at the speed of sound  You're falling down all around  Oh, oh  Bombs lighting up the eastern sky  The back room deals in the bottom line  The earth's shaking but we don't know why  A million fires, oceans rise  Oh, oh  I leave it all when I feel you near  What I'm saying is I need you here  Even though love never seems to last 
[03:06:30]  If you think we got a chance  Stay a while  Oh, you got to stay a while  Oh, oh  These days are wild  Jackie, won't you stay a while  Drop the needle on the bell brigade  We slow dance till the moonlight fades 
[03:07:00]  Tell me now that you never leave  You always stay here with me  Oh, oh  I'll keep you safe from the circus show  The bullshit and the blowing smoke  The knife hidden under every sleeve  They'll stab your back  They'll watch you bleed  Oh, oh  They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear  Like  I could make you a star next year  Well  If New York City's lights are so bright  How come so many people crying tonight  Stay a while 
[03:07:30]  Stay a while  Oh, you got to stay a while  Oh, oh  These days are wild  Jackie, won't you stay a while  Let your hair fall around your face 
[03:08:00]  I would kill just to keep you safe  Put your body next to mine  Sorry mom  Just let go and close your eyes  I shiver when I feel your skin  Like a sinner who's been forgiven  Go on baby, shine your light  Cause no one's gonna find us here tonight  Stay a while  Oh, you got to stay a while 
[03:08:30]  Hey, yo  These days are wild  Jackie, won't you stay a while  Jackie, won't you stay a while  Jackie, won't you stay a while  Jackie, that's crazy  Where are you going?  She's just going  My cheeks are shaking  That's amazing  She's just going back to Rochester  That reminds me of another intern send-off from 
[03:09:00]  I don't remember  Remember when we  No  There was that intern  Yeah, we've been serenading the interns for many, many years now  There's a rock star singing a ballad  To an intern begging her to stay  Oh my god, I will  She said it  She said it  Actually, I'm looking for an intern  Oh  Really?  Must have passport  I have a passport  What is going on?  Wow  It sounds like an abduction 
[03:09:30]  And no record  No criminal record  No criminal record  Oh, that might be a problem  No  No  There's none  Too bad Ryan Starr looks like a serial killer right now  Or that's what's up next  Sounds like a great proposition  Nothing  I go back to school  And that's  That's about it  School  Yeah, I can put that off  See?  School  I don't really need school  I'm teeing her up  I'm teeing her up for a job  Alright  Oh, man  How did this go for you?  Did you learn a lot?  Did they teach you all their wisdom? 
[03:10:00]  I did  They taught me all their wisdom  I learned a lot  What?  Sam or not  You're really holding a grudge from your internship  It appears so  It was a different experience  Sam has the feeling  That perhaps we didn't treat him  As nicely when he was an intern  Or any other intern  As we treat Jackie  It's not just me  I speak for every intern  That ever interned here  What are you talking about?  Except for Jackie  What are you?  The Martin Luther King of interns?  Yes  Come on  Speak for everybody  We've always been  Judged the interns  On the content of the character 
[03:10:30]  Not the beauty of  I mean  The color of their skin  He had a dream  Paid lunches  Ryan Starr with the new record  That's cool, brother  Yeah, man  You know  The band and I  We've been touring for like  Four  When I first met you guys  It was just me and my acoustic guitar  You know  But since then we've put together  A great band  And very much  You know  I became friendly with  Stevie Van Zandt  From Springsteen's band  And like  He became  I've never had a mentor  You know  I never had someone  I could sit and really learn from 
[03:11:00]  So I was figuring this all out  On the streets myself  You know  Yeah  And he taught me some great things  And I feel really  I feel like  I kind of  I put this great band together  The way he has  His E Street band  You know  It's a solo artist  But it is a band  It would be so weird  So if you come and see me play  It's like that  It would be like  Syl  Telling me stuff  Hey Tone  Hey Brian  Hey T  He's one of the greatest  Most brilliant musical guys  Yeah yeah  He really is  He knows his shit man  And knows everything  About what it's like  To be out on the road 
[03:11:30]  The guy's been there  For his whole life man  It's amazing  I'm listening to his channel  On Sirius XM  What the fuck  Garage  Yeah he is a good guy man  That's a great channel  So he taught me like  And I went into the studio  With these guys  And I was  And he reminded me  You know  After all the music  You hear over the years  And especially a guy like that  Who was there from the beginning  Sure  It's like you gotta go  With a purpose  And I thought with this new music  I was like  I need to  I'm not just gonna do it  I'm not just gonna make  Another record  And I was like  What is the purpose here  So essentially  That brought a lot of honesty out  I'm getting text messages  From people I've known 
[03:12:00]  Or Twitters  Or Facebooks  Whatever  Like concerned about my well being  And like  Oh it sounds like  Are you okay  Yeah really  And at first  I was thrown off by it  But then I'm like  Wow I think  I think it's just  The honest new music  On this Animals EP  I think it's striking  A new chord with people  This is all well and good  But we're getting  A little too far away  From the fact  That Jackie  You know  Jackie's mom  Didn't come down  From Rochester  Is that where you're from  Rochester 
[03:12:30]  Yeah  They're rough and tough  There man  Water Street Music Hall  Exactly  I played there  With my band stage  Back in the day  Oh my god  They wanted me to sign their car  Instead of the pictures  But only after I smashed it  With a baseball bat  Really  I kid you not  I'm looking at this guy's car  He's like  Can you hit the hood  It didn't have a dent on it  This kid wanted me to smash his car  With a baseball bat  And then sign  Probably had a little too much  See that dent  Yeah alright  We get it 
[03:13:00]  Rochester man  Wow  You got a song for Jackie's mom  I don't want her to feel like that  Maybe a new song from Animals  I don't know  This one  Is it appropriate for Jackie's mom  Yeah let's do it  Or does you have to do earmuffs  Alright  Jackie's mom  You ever break up with someone  Oh yeah  Oh boy  Break up man  It's the coolest  Break up song  I think  I think  You know  It's tough to write a breakup song  When you're a dude  So  This is the dude breakup song 
[03:13:30]  I guess  It's for Jackie's mom  That or I got a song called  Psycho Suicidal Girl  If that's more  You  We're good  We're good  We're good  She says  It's not too picky  I usually say that for the Jersey girls  Not the  Not the Rochester  And this is  This is off the EP Animals  This is off the EP Animals  We made a  We made a pretty hot video for it actually  You can go on  YouTube or Vivo  Or whatever right now  Appropriate for Jackie's mom to watch  It's got a  It's got a steamy pool scene  Uh oh  We actually  We were in this house in Connecticut  This really rich  Richie 
[03:14:00]  Connecticut  It's kind of like this bling ring style thing  Where these kids rob this house  And it turns into  You know  It's a hot video  It turns into a party right  It turns into  Ryan  Little party  Jackie's mom  You know  Would you?  Oh my god  He would right  Alright alright  Let's get to it  Let's play music now  Here you go  Oh my  Is that comfortable for both of us?  Right?  He would though  Hey

[03:19:30]  I'm sure it was really banging  What a guy  That's awesome  You know, stay in touch  Twitter and Facebook  All that stuff  Good to hear from you, man  All right, boys  Well, thank you  All right, John  Later, man  Wow  Jackie  You know  Sounds like you should stick around  What more can we say?  Good thing I have to pack up the car today  Oh, man  Do you need help  Because  What?  My last day of my internship 
[03:20:00]  Yeah  I went to Hooters with Travis  Well, the boxes  One of the worst meals of my life  Sounds like a party  I've seen all the different clothes she wears  And the boxes are going to be heavy  And of course Jackie's mom's not going to be able to handle the big heavy boxes  So I figure maybe I should lend a hand  I guess you're feeling helpful  Of course  That's what a gentleman does  Yeah, I know  But we're not talking about a gentleman  Who's replacing Jackie?  Oh, God  No one replaces Jackie  No one  There is no one  I mean, there'll be someone in her place 
[03:20:30]  But no one will replace Jackie  Can we possibly grab a ray of sunshine  And bring it in the building?  I think not  So replace?  No  No  No  Would be hilarious, though  If we got two more cute girls next semester  And they would just  Be like who?  Yeah, out of sight  Out of mind  What?  What is that?  Remember Sidney?  Who was he?  Well, we've cut the cake 
[03:21:00]  We've serenaded Jackie  Oh, God  And her mom  It's much later than we would have stayed  In any other circumstance  You stayed late  On a Friday  On a Friday before vacation  I did say when I got here at 5.30  Alright, let's get this shit over with  Maybe we'll leave early  Yeah  I was hoping to get out at 9.30  But not with Jackie  Obviously  Obviously you're all welcome to continue this  On the Sam Roberts After Show  Oh, thank you  The Goodbye Party will continue, right?  Yes, which kicks up right after  Maybe you could, you know  Your fantastic interviews  That I hear your listeners call up and go 
[03:21:30]  Oh, you're so fantastic  Sam, you should do the show  And they should do the After Show  Why are you drinking Haterade?  Haterade?  Yeah  Oh, God  I'd punch you  Did you like the balloons?  Oh, the balloons good?  Eric's telling me I gotta move them, though  Why?  What is he doing?  What's the matter?  Buzz kill  Matt and E-Rock for telling her to move the balloons  Move the balloons  Can you give Jackie a show?  Wow, you know what? 
[03:22:00]  It seems like you're handing him out  Yeah  Maybe she should do the After Show today  She probably should  But she does have that voice  Well  Sam has that voice  Yeah, Sam has that voice  You're right  Yeah, that's true  Ryan, we got the plugs in  Because we do have to leave  Animals is the EP  You're doing it yourself  Animals on iTunes right now  Okay, I encourage everyone to go check out  Ryan Starr and his music  Cool dude  When are we hanging out again?  Yeah, last time  What?  We hanged with Billy Joel?  Was it the last time we  Yeah, people  Damn  We were  We were 
[03:22:30]  We were  See, now Jackie's mom's impressed  That's right  That's right  I hung with Billy Joel  And we drank a little red wine  Believe it or not  You know, a bottle of red  Yeah, that was us then  A little bottle of red  But I  Kind of mood you're in tonight  Kind of a thing  We were just hanging though  Jackie's mom  Oh, well  Just hanging  And then he was talking about the pot  And then STP  Of course, they were complete assholes  To me and Ryan Starr  They wouldn't meet anybody  That's just 
[03:23:00]  But they're STP  They're fucking  They're known for that  They're the kind of guys  That wear sunglasses  In interviews in the morning  Oh  Oh, wait a minute  Listen, I've had shows  We've had sold out shows  All this week in New York City  So tonight's the last one  At Mercury Lounge  Mercury Lounge  And the voice  The glasses  I'm just  I'm happy to be here  Nobody else  I'd probably pull myself out of bed  That's not  See  Look at that  Jackie  He's not talking about us  He's talking about you  Oh, no, Jackie  I couldn't stop smiling 
[03:23:30]  I'm glad  It was beautiful  He was just talking about her  Amazing  I'm going to give it to her  I am  Jackie's mom  Did I get you  Going a little bit  And you guys  A little bit, right?

Are they kidding me?  They're just gold, aren't they?  They're awesome  Let me tell you how good they are  I turn on my Twitter every day  And I just go  What are they going to complain about today?

[03:24:30]  So we'll see you  Do we have another song for Jackie?  Yes, we do  Oh, we do?  What?  Which one are we going with?  She just got serenaded  You know the song Jackie Blue  Jackie's mom, right?  No  They played it for me yesterday  Ooh, Jackie Blue  That one  I don't think I know that one  What kind of music do you like?  I like all sorts of music  Very, but that one  I'm not sure  Do you like my music?  How about mine?  How about you start with  I like Ryan Starr  Ryan Starr, definitely top 
[03:25:00]  There you go  I've always been good with moms  When I was a kid  If my friends were going to a party  It was like  Is Ryan going to be there?  And if Ryan was there  Then they were like  Allowed to go to the party  Yeah, that was  That was my early days  Learning the mom's circuit  A little hippie-ish mom  Back in the day, no?  Yeah, I think she was  A little bit?  She just hides it from me  Really?  Yeah, I find out some things lately  Do you go in the backyard  And sneak a little weed?  Yeah  Did you see the one she gave? 
[03:25:30]  What do you want to know about your mom?  This is what I just recently found out  At a wedding  Yeah  Because, yeah  What do you want to know  What do you want to know about your mom?  We could get it out of her  No, that was the exact one right there  Oh, you're wondering about that  That smile set it off for me  All right  What's the song for Jackie?  We'll just play it  As we end the show  Oh, okay  E-Rock picked this  It's not the one from yesterday, right?  No  You and I talked about it  Earlier in the week  See  What?  Earlier in the week 
[03:26:00]  I like prepping for my radio show  You've never prepped for your radio show  You had to call your old boss  From 15 years ago today  Jackie, say hi to Wheeze  You'll be on Wheeze's show Tuesday?  Yes, I will  All right  And that's it  Jackie's mom, thank you  Flying star, thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Bring it to Jackie  She had a wonderful summer  I'll bet you did  You know, it's just our job  To do that with every intern  And, you know  You failed up at home 
[03:26:30]  We don't discriminate  Oh, Jackie's getting a little background  What about mom?  Little mom  What about mom?  Oh, you got to hook up mom  We got some delicious cake  All right  We're going to play this for Jackie  And we're taking a rare week off  So we'll see you guys a week from Monday  I guess, right?  Yes, absolutely  Very cool  All right  Bye-bye  Thank you  You just gotta ignite the light  And let it shine  Just around the night

[03:29:00]  Celebration continues  It hasn't stopped  Of course not  Jackie's here  On her last day  Jackie's mom  Ryan Starr was brought in  Because she had to be serenaded  On her last day  I'd never seen anything so ridiculous  In my life  None of it was necessary  Is that the whole reason  You did come in  Or were you here at another  Oh my god  I'll show you the email  What did they  They emailed you and said  We need you to come in  And serenade our intern 
[03:29:30]  And there was a picture attached  And you were like, yes  Maybe that was a problem  They probably tried to get somebody  To serenade me  But then they attached my picture  And I'm like, no  No, I'm not going to do that  Like, side to a Bob's leaving the show  Yeah  Get him out of there  Quick  Jackie, are you thrilled  With how this went?  I think it's amazing  I didn't expect  Any of it  But the cake  But you did  See  Sidney got a cake 
[03:30:00]  I did expect the cake  And maybe some balloons  Are you going to  Text Sidney  And let her know  That you got a better  Party than she did  I don't think  I'm going to say it that way  I would  I mean, let her know  Well, the photos will be up  On the Facebook  In a few minutes  So we can see  Maybe she's listening  I don't know  I don't know  I don't think she'd listen  Jackie's mom  The other girl intern  She had a celebration  Last week  But it was just a cake  And balloons  It was not this whole  Affair that today 
[03:30:30]  I thought last  Honestly, I thought last week  Was way over the top  And unnecessary  So this, to me  Is just disgusting  The cake explains  Yeah, well, yeah  Yeah  I missed last week  What happened?  Well, last week  We lost  We had two girl interns  This semester  Jackie was one  And the other one  Was Sydney  And we don't normally  Have girl interns  On this show  Believe it or not, Ryan  And so when we did  It was just  To say it was a huge 
[03:31:00]  Distraction  Would be an understatement  I mean, like  We boosted morale  Yeah  Oh, and you know  I have a reputation  For throwing things  At interns  For just  Like I said  The last star intern  Shaved his eyebrows  And said, alright  Take a hike  We shaved his eyebrows  And then we drew in  New ones  That kind of look  Like The Rock  They waxed Sal  At one point  Yeah, Sal got waxed  And bronzered  I mean, this is what  We do to the people  On the show  And then like 
[03:31:30]  Jackie comes in  And gets this  And Sydney also  Last week got a  Cake and balloons  And everything  See, normally  The question would be like  Oh, you're leaving early  This is the end  Of your internship, huh?  You get a hard time  But instead  There's a party  And you're a firework  I was supposed to live  Next week  And you all decided  No, you're going to  Take your own vacation  Right  So I had to end early  Yeah, yeah  You decided  You're going to  Take your own vacation  The show  Is going to go on vacation  But interning  Is kind of like  It's a preview 
[03:32:00]  To how life  Is going to be  In the workforce  And how you have  To pay your dues  So this is probably  An accurate portrayal  Of how her life  Will be  Everywhere she goes  You know  You remember  Paying your dues  Starting in music  Man, I still am  I'm here at 9.30  In the morning  Right  Right  I interned at a record label  Just down the street  When I was in  Just out of high school  Just like you  On my way to college  And I interned  I took the Long Island Railroad  Every day  It was terrible  And I, you know  Had to get coffee  All that stuff  But it really did pay off 
[03:32:30]  Because one of the guys  I worked for to this day  Now is my manager  Actually  Like years later  But it's  It was probably  A longer road  Than you're ever  Going to drive on  To tell you the truth  She kind of already  Seems like she's  At the cusp  Of getting there  Like this internship  Alright  My dues are now paid  So I got the cake  I got the ceremony  Now we just need a show  Now we just need a show  Yeah, well  I think this show  Is going to be  I'm glad you're leaving  Because otherwise  They would be giving you this 
[03:33:00]  Snowy in Michigan  Hey, how you doing, Sam?  Good  I acknowledge this  Probably a bit  And I understand that  But I didn't think  It would get any worse  Than it did last week  This week, yeah  This week was worse  Is it all like  Do you like  This amount of attention  Thrown your way, Jackie?  I mean, it doesn't hurt  You like it  Yeah, but I don't  Need the attention  No, but you like  Because some people  Don't like attention  Like some people are like  No, I don't want to 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, but this probably  Isn't really the business  You want to go into  If you don't like  The attention  So what are you going to do  Back in Rochester now?  I have no idea  Because I feel like  This is one of those things  Where you're in this  Big radio show for the summer  And they've got  Ryan Stark coming in  And singing songs  And the cake  And the balloons  Nothing will ever top that  So what happens now?  That's  I feel bad  Because you're  How old are you?  19  What if it never gets better  Than this?  What if this is it?  But that's what I said  About the last internship  My last internship was amazing  You can't shake her  You can't shake her 
[03:34:00]  And she's like  Oh my god  I'm starting to feel terrible  About my life  I was 19 once  Yeah, welcome to the club  You should just write  In yellow marker  Right under  Opie and Anthony's show  On this poster  And Jackie  And they'd be like  That's adorable  I did that actually  At the last internship  I put my name  On a piece of paper  She interned  She interned  For Brother Weez  Up in Rochester  Who's Opie's mentor  Yeah  And she said  That her career plan  Was well 
[03:34:30]  One day Brother Weez  Will retire  And then I'll probably  Get his show  He's 65  I mean I'm saying  He's got at least  10 years  He's going to keep going  It's my career plan  I said one day  Michael Jackson's  Going to die  And I'll be there  There you go  I'm ready to step in  I can't believe  I know this little  Beaver crap  Just you know  Yeah  That's annoying  Well now I'm waiting for him  Well Beaver's burning out quick  So you should be  In good condition  Yeah you're good  Is that scary  When you  Do you pay attention  To the fact that like  Rock music is having  Such a hard time 
[03:35:00]  Surviving right now  I  You know  It has had a  Incredibly hard time  Surviving  Do you just worship  Like Jack White  And Dave Grohl  For keeping the  Genre alive  They do  In an interesting way  Though right  It's like  They're their own thing  Right  They're not  Carrying a movement  Like in the 90's  When I got into music  It was like  Pearl Jam  Nirvana  Smash Pumpkins  Night Snail  Scream  It was just a whole body  And like  You would turn on pop radio  Like the crap  You'd hear  Like you would hear  Real music all the time 
[03:35:30]  Everywhere you went  But I think now  I think there's like  Look I made a commitment  On this new record  To like be honest  And like bring that back  And it's a little bit like  It's got Pearl Jam moments  It's got these like  Peter Gabriel moments  Of real music  And some people don't know  What the hell to make of it  To be honest  I don't know the last time  They heard these sonics  Like real drums recorded  And all that stuff  You know  In the vein of pop music  Not Jack White  Not Foo Fighters  Not that art  But like  You know  In the realm of like  More mainstream music  And their ears 
[03:36:00]  I think take a second  To like  Go back to like  What is real  You know  Well you kind of have to  Sit there  And like in your position  You gotta sit there  And say  Well I know  This is gonna turn around  Like things move in cycles  Sure  And you're like  But how long  Is this  Like this is the biggest circle  I've ever seen in my life  I'm staying true  And it's definitely interesting  And it's always a little sad  I'm more sad  Because I feel like  Well the 13 year old kid  You know  Today  Like what is he really  Being exposed to  And like how is he looking  I mean I follow Rihanna  On Instagram  It's like  You're following a porn star 
[03:36:30]  Yeah it's amazing  It's crazy  It's a little girl  Is a follower  It's like  8 million  Yeah I can't believe  That Rihanna's Instagram  Is not like headline news  Every day  Jackie do you follow Rihanna  On Instagram  No I don't  You have to  I mean you shouldn't  And mom  If she does  If she does  You should take a look  Because  I mean Ryan's right  It is  It's soft core pornography  At this point  I mean I enjoy it  I'm not encouraging her to stop  But you're right  Like a bunch of little kids 
[03:37:00]  Are just like  I love Rihanna  Umbrella  Yeah  And like I'm all for it  But it's just like  Well where's the music  Where's like the rock star  Where's the  You know even Madonna  Had something to back that up  And all that  But you know  I'm here to  This is like this new music  I'm here to make a stand  And be like  Here it is  Maybe people are ready for it  If they are  They'll love it  If they're not  I gotta find an internship  I mean  I've been doing this  I've been with ONA  For like eight years now  Nine years  And you know  They're kind of looking at me like  Sam turn on the radio 
[03:37:30]  How many talk shows  Are out there anymore  Yeah  You know what I mean  It's not happening right now  And you're like  Well you gotta  Somebody's gotta be the guy  Right  Like you can't just not do it  You know  It's not like  It's not like you're gonna sit there  And say  I don't know  Maybe I should learn to rap  That seems like  Maybe I should  That's what happens  Start DJing on the side  But that is what happens right  Yeah  So all these kids  The new form of whatever  They think their outlet is  Is that  It didn't work for Hammer though  When rap started going more gangster  And MC Hammer was like 
[03:38:00]  No I can go with this  They were like  No you can't buddy  No you can't  You shouldn't have spent all that money  Larry in Louisiana  Hollywood  I'm Larry  Sammy Sweetheart  The F.N. Roberts  Professional Broadcaster  How are you Larry  Ryan's looking at you like  What  This is Larry  I'm impressed  He calls in a lot  I enjoy him  Because he says nice things about me  But most of the people who listen  Do not like Larry  Hi Larry  Hi 
[03:38:30]  Hi  And sir  I've never heard of you before  I gotta confess  I'm not gonna front  But I did enjoy your music  I thought it was  You know the musicianship  Your skills on guitar  Were nice  I mean for strum  It was  It really was good music  I enjoyed it  And I would seriously consider  Checking out your EP  How do you like that?  You have  Somebody's going to  Seriously consider it  That's awesome man  Thanks for the time  Yeah but he has to understand too  I'm a white haired fat old man  I'm not really in his demographic 
[03:39:00]  That's not your demo?  No that's perfect  That's perfect  I'm singing in Pretty Girls  All morning  Wasting my time  You're sick of it  I didn't realize you were out there man  That's awesome  So what's going on  I'm noticing my strum  That's the best part  These girls aren't appreciating my strum  Yeah yeah  The movement of the hand  Up and down  Only  Yeah  White haired  Fat dude  Yeah  I appreciate it  I appreciate that  So what's going on today with you Larry?  Well Sam  I  You know I talked to Tyler  Screening the phones 
[03:39:30]  Figured that's where he would be  Yeah  And what I want to know  And I just thought of this  Is how long is it going to be  Before Jackie or Sidney  Is featured in Jocktober?  Well Sidney  And that's the other thing  Thank you Larry  Sidney went on  And she actually has a gig in radio  Do you have anything  Are you going to be able to go back  To your  Rochester station?  Yeah I'll go back to Wee's  And still be able to work for him  A little bit probably  But  I mean  Ours is  That one's  They don't really have as many openings  Like that  Right  Mom are you 
[03:40:00]  Are you worried about the  How full in on radio is Jackie?  Full in  Like this is what she wants to do  This is  She is all in  Really?  Is that worry you at all?  No  Because I think Jackie's very driven  She's going to end up  Well obviously  Somehow making it  She made an impact here didn't she?  She did  She did  Were you impressed with the impact  That she made on this show?  I was very impressed  She called me  I have to tell you  She called me the first day  She was here  And she was on  The Wee show  Three days a week 
[03:40:30]  So she had a lot of air time  She calls me  She goes  I'm getting coffee in the morning  I'm doing this  I'm doing that  And I will never be on the air  The entire  The entire time I'm here  In the summer  I liked it  I liked it  But I liked it  She was not afraid  Because most of the interns  Come in  They're like  Oh I'm just here to do whatever  She was never afraid  To be like  No I would like to be on the air  Yeah  That's it  That's kind of what I'm going for here  That's what I would like  Okay well don't worry  Just make the best of it  Work hard  It'll be okay  You know you can't always  You know you're only 19  Next day I get a text 
[03:41:00]  From my brother-in-law  Saying oh I'm listening to Jackie  On the radio  And she's doing an awesome job  I'm like  I thought you were never  Going to be on the radio  She's like  I judge the situation  And now  Not only is the boy intern  Screening calls  In the other room  For this whole thing  Yeah  But he told me yesterday  That at one point  Somebody gave Jackie  A food order  And she wrote down the order  And then handed him the paper  And he went down  And it was the right move Jackie  Was I said  I was probably sitting on the phones 
[03:41:30]  I wouldn't just be an ass  And be like  Here go get this  I did a lot of runs  If I was on the phones though  You were like  I'm not trying to get off the phones  To do a food run right now  You take a hike  Exactly  You know  What if I get called in the studio  What if I need to  What if I need to go on the air  I like doing runs though  Because you know what  That's when they talk to you  And that's when you get on air  Smart  It's when you bring in the food  It's when you bring in the oatmeal  And when I brought in his juice  She knows exactly  What's my life that's on  She knows exactly what she's doing  I could use a coffee 
[03:42:00]  Can we get her on one last run  Can we do one  For old times sake  E-Rock told me in my ear  That Tyler's in there  Contesting all this  But I don't even think  I want to hear from him  To tell you the truth  You sure?  Yeah  You know  What's he going to say?  It's your show  Mike in Connecticut  Hey  Can this Sam character  Get off the air  I mean we're all listening  We're all just waiting for Jackie  To ask Ryan Starr  The question of the day  Which is  What's the hat?  That's my question 
[03:42:30]  Get out of here  Mike  You wouldn't take my job  Would you?  Never  You probably would have  What if you had the option?  Because it seems like  You might soon  You would  You would  Eric  What did he say?  Nothing  I said wrong answer  You say in a heartbeat  Yeah  That's the way to go  So  Back to Rochester  Today?  Tomorrow?  Today  We'll leave  We'll go back  Pack up  Had we thought about  The Ryan Starr thing  We would have stayed  Do you go to shows 
[03:43:00]  At Water Street Musical?  Yeah  I worked promotions too  At my old radio station  That's like the road  That's like the venue up there  It is  Yeah  And what kind of music  Do you like?  I like anything  From rap to rock  To country  Yeah anytime  As long as they're singing  To her directly  She likes anything  I'm just not as big as  It's like we talked about yesterday  Jazz  I don't like jazz  But we went to the play yesterday  Oh we went to Rock of Ages yesterday  And she knew  She sang 
[03:43:30]  That's not jazz  Let's see  Anyone listening  That is definitely not jazz  She sang  Oh my god  She sang for two straight hours  She knew every word  To every age of the song  You sang along?  Is that what you do there?  I don't know  The people in front of me  Looked mad  But they're foreign  So I don't really care  Sing this one  Ready  Just a small town girl  Living in a lonely world  I can't sing as good as you  She took the midnight train  Going anywhere  Just a city boy 
[03:44:00]  Born and raised in South Detroit  He took the midnight train  Going anywhere  People are going to sing along  In the car right now  Don't stop  Believing  Hold on to that feeling  Treat lights  People  Very good 
[03:44:30]  Eric how's Tyler doing in there?  He's screaming  What is happening here?  When did everyone get nice?  What's wrong with Tyler?  He's not understanding  What's going on  We're all friends in here  Singing along  Like who doesn't love Journey?  There's always one wet blanket  At the party  Jesus Christ  Tyler  You gotta get over yourself  How long is  The lover boy thing?  Oh  Hold on  Let me find it  Just make sure you tell me  In my earphones  When I'm running out of time 
[03:45:00]  Because I gotta play that  At the end  Have you seen the movie  Spring Breakers?  No  We talk about that  Spring break forever  You saw it  How great was that movie?  It's like my new music video  It's  Not really  Really?  I mean there was a pool scene  That everyone needs to go check out  It's pretty cool  How can you find your music video?  What's it called?  Well just go on YouTube  Ryan Star Impossible  It should be there  Is that the song you sang today?  Yeah  Very cool  Very cool  But yeah  Spring break forever  Such a good movie 
[03:45:30]  We're gonna listen to it  On the way home  A lot of people hate that movie  I know  I know  A lot of people hate it  You either love it  Or you hate it  I watched it again last night  And like  The montage  Of  It starts with James Franco  On the piano  I love it  Singing every time  By Britney Spears  Like it might be my favorite scene  In any movie  I really love that scene  It's amazing  But I bring that up  Because  Sunday  I do a show called  The Sam Roberts Show  On this channel  At 4pm Eastern  And Vanessa Hudgens  From Spring Breakers 
[03:46:00]  Is gonna be on that show  Really?  This Sunday  Yeah  I mean  Look  Last week  Howie Mandel was on  I know  And he did the voice of Bobby  From Bobby's World  So it's the type of show  That you never know  What's gonna happen  You have to  Have you ever met anybody  That you've  Jerked off to?  Yeah  Um  That's a great question  Will this be the first?  Maybe  I've been watching  Spring Breakers  For the ninth time  1am  You met Kardashian  Yeah but I don't know  You never jerked off  To Kardashian  I don't know  It was Khloe  And I don't know  If I jerked off to her  Before I interviewed her 
[03:46:30]  Oh okay  You know  That's the trick  Same thing with Snooki  You meet these people  That like on television  You're supposed to like hate  Because they're reality stars  And then I end up  Having a crush on them  After I talk to them  You know  I have a cousin  On this terrible show  I'm not even gonna talk about it  Which show is it?  Which show is it?  You know what  I don't even  I can't support it  How about what  It's terrible  It's like an anti-Semitic show  What?  Is it Big Brother?  No it's called  Princesses on  Oh it's a  Like Long Island  Princesses thing 
[03:47:00]  Yeah  Your cousin's on it?  Oh man  You gotta watch  My Boys  That's a funny reality show  My Boys  My Uncle's on My Boys  RC in Illinois  Yeah Sam  Yeah  I just wanted to remind you  I'm kinda like E-Rock  I got a memory  Like an elephant  And a body to match  So I believe  You working on that one  For a while?

[03:47:30]  Tyler is supposed to be  The official intern  Of the After O&A show  Yeah I mean  Tyler was intern douchebag  Supposed to be  The official intern  Of this show  But I don't know  He's a little boring  You know  Like you come in here  You're singing songs  You're like  You're a ray of sunshine  Like they say  Maybe they're on to something  I don't know  If I would've gotten you  A cake and a rock star  But  It's alright  I would've just taken  The rock star  I didn't need the cake  How's that Roland?  This is so much more  Uncomfortable  Because your mom is here 
[03:48:00]  Or is it exactly  How it should be  Spring break forever  I was really nervous  To bring her in  But it was all  Because of Sam  Sam convinced me  He said  Well I told her  I told her awkward is good  Always  So just  Whatever you can do  To make it weird  That's what we should be doing  Is your picture  On the Opie and Anthony website  Or the Sam  I mean  Have people seen  What you look like?
