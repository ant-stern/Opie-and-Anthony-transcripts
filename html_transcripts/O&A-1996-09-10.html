<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the usual boisterous banter between Opie, Anthony, and Ozone.  Ozone regaled them with a story about his childhood caddying experience for a couple whose last name was "Cunt," sparking a series of crude jokes about the parents' names and Ozone's adolescent embarrassment.  A caller then phoned in, complaining about a coworker who constantly boasted about visiting rival radio station BCN. This led to Opie and Anthony sharing similar childhood anecdotes about dealing with annoying braggarts.  The conversation segued into a discussion about a newly released Nirvana live album, *From the Muddy Banks of the Wishka*, which they teased playing later in the show, accompanied by playful ribbing and a bet between the hosts.  Further calls followed, including one from a listener expressing their hatred for the show and another, seemingly intoxicated caller, who issued a bizarre public challenge to Aerosmith's Steven Tyler for an on-air drug test. The segment concluded with more crude jokes and banter, including a mention of a masturbator, and various show announcements.  The entire broadcast was characterized by a heavy use of offensive language and crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I like this. Hold on.  Oh yeah.  I feel like I'm in a lounge somewhere.  Beautiful music.  107.3.  Nothing but your favorite light hits.  Can you imagine?  Hey, Ope!  Anthony!  Where's Anthony?  Anthony just walked in.  That mudahuck, yeah.  This is where we do a threesome every day.  Ozone, Opie, and Anthony.  Dude, very funny break about the weird names, man.  Tumor, colon, gash, and...  Yeah, I like those.  Tumor. 
[00:00:30]  Armani Tumor.  On the Patriots.  That's his name.  Can you imagine if his parents called him Brain for a nickname?  Brain Tumor.  He was really smart in school.  Hey, you Brain Tumor.  I got you beat, though.  What?  I was going to bring this up on our show, but what the hell.  When I was growing up, I caddied for like 14 years.  And I caddied...  I'm like, Bropy.  I caddied for the...  I can't even say the name on the radio, I don't think.  Say it.  It's spelled K-U-N-T-Z.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  12 years old. 
[00:01:00]  I had a caddy for the cunts.  I swear to you, I'm not lying.  I am not lying.  There's a true story.  You can look it up on Long Island.  There's a couple...  Guess what her name is.  Anita.  I swear to you.  Get out of here.  I swear to you.  You can look this up.  I'll believe Dick Sweat from Holden.  Dick Sweat.  And I'll believe Harry Colon for the Detroit Lions.  Dude, I got you beat.  His name was Dick, too.  Get out of here. 
[00:01:30]  Dick and Anita Cunt.  I swear to you.  I swear to you.  This is not outrageous radio.  This is the God's honest truth.  I'm telling you.  These people's parents should be shot or locked up.  One or the other.  Well, know how embarrassing it was when you're 12 years old and you're a pimple-faced kid  and you're just caddy for the couple and you had to say, thank you, Mrs. Cunt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I was going to say, you know, I wonder why your shoulders look so droopy.  14 years of caddying, man.  Dude, I swear to you.  It's a true story.  Anita and Dick. 
[00:02:00]  So what else is going on today?  That's about it.  What else needs to be said, dude?  I don't think that word's ever been said on the radio.  Hey, you guys want to hear a quick phone call real quick?  Sure.  Let me see if I can find this one here.  Hold on.  This guy called up.  He's working with somebody.  He's got a problem.  Hold on.  Hey, Ozone, listen.  You've got to help me out here.  What's up?  One of my friends, right?  A good friend of mine, he spent, like, the day at BCN, and he thinks he's the man and  all this other stuff.  Okay.  So it's like Battle of the Radio Stations where we work out.  Okay. 
[00:02:30]  And he's got, like, this picture of him at BCN, and he's going on and on and on.  I'm like, BCN is so lame.  Well, I can't get the radio station changed back to AAF unless, like, I show up at AAF and  get a picture like me and you.  Anytime.  Come on down, man.  I'll do anything to get our radio station played.  All right, man.  I'll hold you to it because, like, I'm dying.  I've got to listen to this slop and hear about him and the program director and how much  of the great friends and everything.  It's killing me.  I wouldn't be saying too much about that with the reputation.  Yeah, you know, let me tell you something right now.  I used to let that call keep going. 
[00:03:00]  You know what that reminded me of, that phone call, about how this guy went to BCN for a  day?  Yeah.  Remember when we were kids and we all had to go to work with our parents?  It was like to take your kid to school.  That's exactly what that is.  Go see a bunch of folks.  We don't even really talk about them anymore because we've already beat them.  There's nothing else to be said, really.  All right.  Is that going to do it for us?  Yeah, I guess.  We're outie.  All right.  Opie and Anthony are next.  Thanks for listening to The Ozone.  We appreciate it.  And it's Alice on WAF.  2.3 WAF with Tool and Stink Fist on the only station that really rocks. 
[00:03:30]  That's our favorite song right now because of the title.  I love Stink Fist.  I thought they were just going to call it Stink Finger.  Stink Finger.  They went the distance.  Stink Fist.  Stink Nose.  What's that?  Stepping into the Ozone Cafe.  That's right.  If you will.  Dude, look what I got in my hand.  Whoa.  Rock.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:00]  That must be the new Nirvana.  That's live Nirvana.  Yeah.  Aneurysm.  That's right, man.  I don't even know if we're allowed to play this.  Screw it.  Shelly Belly went down and met the UPS guy, and he just handed it to her.  And I think we're supposed to wait on playing this, but heck with it.  We're going to play it first.  And then all the other stations in Boston, they're going to panic, and then they're going 
[00:04:30]  to have to play it first, and then we're all going to break the rules.  Let's get screwed.  All right, but we've got to tease it, though.  You are horrible.  I like pissing off our listeners.  What the hell?  But, yeah, the new live CD is going to be called From the Muddy Banks of the Wishka.  Wishka.  Wishka.  In stores October 1st.  You want me to run down the set list of this live Nirvana CD?  Yeah, what do they got?  School, Drain U, Aneurysm, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Bin of Sun, Lithium. 
[00:05:00]  Wait, I need some background music for this.  Sliver, Spank Through, Scentless Apprentice, Heart Shaped Box, Milk It, Negative Creep, Polly,  Breed, Tourette, and Blow.  All right.  Rock.  I was just starting to bang my head against the wall.  I know.  We've got to tease it just for a little bit, and then all the other radio stations in Boston,  they're going to panic, and they're going to have to play it. 
[00:05:30]  But we were first, man.  All right, stick around for live Nirvana.  We'll do it literally in 10 minutes.  He got me.  Right.  He got me.  Oh, dude, I'm going to get him back.  We have a 30-pack bet.  We're going to bet.  How about some Rocko and the Penetrator's getting him back?  Something like that.  You mean to write a song about Anthony?  Yeah, man.  Oh, boy.  Well, see, now, Anthony could write back, and Anthony is a lot better writer than I am.  I'll tell you that.  Anthony's a sick, twisted bastard, okay, dude? 
[00:06:00]  All right, but you keep listening, because it's going to happen.  Yeah, man, definitely.  All right, you keep rocking up in Rhode Island.  Yeah, man, bye.  All right, goodbye.  Oh, Opie's here.  I'll nail you, Rocky.  Hi, Opie.  People are...  Let's take some more calls.  Uh-oh.  Hello, AAF.  Hey, could you play a walk by Pantera?  Yeah, no problem.  AAF, who's this?  Yeah, this is Gowder from West and North.  Because I hate you both.  You hate us both?  Both.  Who, me and Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, wait.  This is Rocco, dude. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Rocco and Opie.  Opie's right here.  DCN rules, baby.  What rules?  DCN.  I laugh at you.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I laugh at you.  I'm just kidding.  Hey, dude, the cars are backing up at the drive-thru, man.  Get off the phone.  Hey, dude, dude, we come to where you work and rock the Slurpee machine.  Don't go back to work.  All right, people are calling.  They heard the bat with me and Ann and a kid from Rhode Island called.  He's mad that you ragged. 
[00:07:00]  What are you bouncing on?  What are you bouncing for?  What the hell is that?  I was drinking too much of that freaking Crank 2.0 again, man.  Screw pot.  Caffeinated water now.  Screw pot.  It's true pot.  It's like you've got to do two or three bottles, and then, like, my head's itching, and I'm seeing colors and stuff.  You know what you have to do?  Take the caffeinated water and make coffee with it.  Boy, you'll be flying.  Hey, dude, you know what I saw?  Wow, it sounds like the Opie and Anthony show still.  Hey, dude, can you leave me the masturbator, Sean?  Uh, no. 
[00:07:30]  You got to.  All right, I will.  People want to hear it.  All right, fine, fine, fine, fine.  I saw a commercial on TV last night, some guy singing for a furniture place.  Hey, liquidation.  Liquidation.  Yeah, well, that is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.  It is the worst commercial on TV.  It even beats out, uh, Bernie and Phil.  Bernie and Phil's furniture warehouse.  Yeah, but this guy's under this stupid big guy's going, uh, he's trying to rap in a suit, and he's got those ugly chicks there.  They can't even do the dance right.  They're ugly.  He's fat. 
[00:08:00]  The beat doesn't even match the song.  And he's like, hey, liquidation.  And they couldn't give that furniture away enough.  Hey, stupid salesman.  Hello.  All right, well.  Oh, brother.  Are you playing Rocco's, uh, phone roulette?  Oh, you want to play more?  No, it's dangerous, man.  Come on, let's.  Hi.  Hi, AF.  Hi.  What's happening with the 9th sales, Maryland, man?  Um.  Take the models out of your mouth.  All right, we'll get you some information on that, okay?  All right.  All right, you just stay right there, toddler. 
[00:08:30]  Hello, AF.  Thank you.  Hello, AF.  Hey, what's up?  Who's this?  Brian.  Brian?  Yeah.  What time did school get out today?  Two o'clock.  I thought it was Breon.  Two.  All right, all right, hang on.  We'll get Barney for you.  Hello, AF.  Hello, I want to know if I can hear some Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  Oh, just kidding, just kidding.  Who is this?  This is Greg.  Were you talking to you in your car? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah, I'm driving to Salem, New Hampshire.  Salem, New Hampshire?  Yeah.  Tax-free Salem.  Yeah, I want to hear some Aerosmith.  Yeah, we never play any.  We'll get some on, though, for you.  We'll make a special for you.  It's Joel Perry's birthday today, too.  Is it?  It certainly is.  Wait, I got a challenge for Aerosmith.  What's that?  You know all the drug rumors are going around and stuff with Aerosmith?  And then, like, Steven Tyler got on MTV and said that he's pissed off and that he's  giving out free, like, piss samples?  I say Steven Tyler comes down to AF, pisses in a cup, and we get him tested for drugs. 
[00:09:30]  And we'll put an end to all the rumors live here on AF.  Have him come down.  So, Steven Tyler, if you're listening.  I'm serious.  Come down.  Because it was all over the news again today, the rumors about the drugs and stuff.  Dude, you really...  Is something else bothering you?  No, I just had too much...  Dude, you're wobbling back and forth.  What's going on, man?  I can use some methods.  Either that they don't.  Dude, what are you doing?  He's got track marks on his arms. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, he's your partner.  Are you watching him?  Who knew?  Who knew Opie's booting up in the bathroom?  Yeah, because you're too busy on the computer fooling people.  Thinking you're some chicken.  They're getting nailed in a room.  We're going to come back.  We'll play Alice in Chains. </pre>
