<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie recounting a harrowing three-hour Easter Sunday drive home from Philadelphia, plagued by rain, aggressive police, and a screaming child.  This led to a discussion on the stresses of parenting, contrasting it with their own less-than-ideal childhoods, including anecdotes about their parents using whiskey to sedate them.  Jim Norton then described his experience at the Ozzy Osbourne documentary premiere, detailing encounters with Ozzy, Sharon Osbourne, Robert De Niro (whom he didn't get a photo with), and Marky Ramone.  He praised the film's candid portrayal of Ozzy's life.  The hosts then shifted to sports, focusing on playoff hockey, Opie's "sports curse," and listener responses.  They also discussed a controversial Canadiens player. A listener suggested Opie use a CB radio for future traffic issues, a suggestion Opie rejected.  Guests mentioned in this section included a planned appearance from Jack Osbourne, Dimitri Martin, and Anderson Silva.


The show continued with a caller, "Steve," engaging in CB radio jargon. This led to a discussion about NHL face shields and Willie O'Ree.  An NHL trivia caller followed, transitioning into mocking AM radio traffic reports.  A caller expressed frustration with the CB radio jokes.  The hosts then discussed a tornado that damaged the St. Louis airport, playing "Meet Me in St. Louis" and referencing a YouTube video of the damage. They mentioned upcoming guests: Anderson Silva, Jack Osbourne, and Dimitri Martin.  Johnny Fairplay's appearance on Dr. Phil, discussing marital issues stemming from his wife's dislike of Opie and Anthony, was also discussed, followed by a debate about Rod Carew's 11th hit anniversary. A D.C. caller criticized the hosts for discussing hockey during the NBA playoffs, leading to a debate on the merits of each sport's playoffs and alleged racism in Boston towards a Black hockey player.  The conversation shifted to Nick Cannon's upcoming paternity leave and his planned home broadcast, prompting discussion on paternity versus maternity leave.


Anderson Silva then joined the studio to promote his documentary, "Like Water."  He discussed his upbringing, career, relationships with other fighters (Vitor Belfort and Chael Sonnen), the pressures of fighting, and the documentary's creation.  He even performed a Muay Thai clinch on Jim Norton.  Later, Jack Osbourne discussed the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of "God Bless Ozzy Osbourne," focusing on the film's creation, his sobriety struggles, and anecdotes about his family, particularly Sharon's personality.  Jim Norton recounted a humorous, poorly received introduction he gave for Ozzy Osbourne at a House of Blues event.  The segment ended with an interview with Kate Middleton (not the royal), whose name led to amusing misunderstandings and pranks.  The hosts briefly discussed the upcoming Royal Wedding and the song "Turn the Page" as a potential great road song.


A humorous anecdote about a job interview mistaken for a date with Prince William kicked off the next segment. This led to a discussion of road songs, mocking suggestions from "Coke Logic" with frequent offensive language.  They criticized Jackson Browne and other artists.  A call from Sarah from Buffalo was followed by further discussion about the Prince William dating misconception, culminating in a highly vulgar and sexually explicit anecdote.  The hosts used numerous offensive terms and slurs throughout this section.  Comedian Dimitri Martin then joined the studio.  The conversation covered his career, comparing his style to other comedians like Todd Barry, Patrice O'Neal, and Geraldo Rivera.  They discussed the New York comedy scene, the challenges of originality, and the pressures of stand-up versus writing.  Martin mentioned his book, "This Is a Book," and upcoming tour dates.  The discussion included further offensive language and sexually suggestive comments, concluding with plugs for Martin's book signing and the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fucking have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Welcome to The Opie and...  Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba.  That sounds like something, right?  Yes.  Hi.  Opie, I heard Anthony in there and I heard a lot of syllables.  Yeah, a lot of syllables.  I just want to start by saying, holy shit, I'm...  I can't even see Anthony.  What happened?  You're not missing much.  I can't see Jimmy.  You're missing a lot there.  All I see is windshield wipers in my mind. 
[00:02:00]  That's the worst.  How long do you have to stare at those?  Well, a lot of people know I go to Philly a lot.  That's where my wife is from and we went down there for Easter, for the little kids' first  Easter.  They did it upright, man.  They fucking treated my son like a king.  It was awesome.  And I said, you know what?  Why don't we push this visit a little bit?  Oh, really?  We'll get on the road around 8.30, have a little dessert in the backyard, relax.  That's crazy. 
[00:02:30]  Well, like 8.30, I think most of the Easter Sunday traffic should be well gone.  We might have just a few delays here and there.  A few stragglers.  But I think if we leave at 8.30, I could be home by 10 o'clock at the latest, sleeping  nice by 10.15, get a nice night's sleep, and then come in and do the radio show with  my pals.  Uh-huh.  There's a little bit of rain.  A little.  Actually, it wasn't even the rain delays, although there were a bunch of huge fucking puddles 
[00:03:00]  that people couldn't navigate through, so that slowed people down on the New Jersey  Turnpike.  Well, that slows the shit out of everybody, yeah.  And then you had the cops that insisted that Easter Sunday's a perfect night to pull people  over, so that slows everyone down.  And 10 miles an hour for an hour straight, pull into my garage a little after 11.30.  Yeah.  It takes an hour and a half tops, usually.  This was a little over three hours.  Yeah, you gotta love the double time. 
[00:03:30]  With a kid that...  When it takes you twice as long.  Yeah.  With a kid that decided he needed to scream the whole way home.  And usually he's pretty good...  You're not a kid.  Well.  Oh.  Makes me realize what my fucking crying has done over the years.  But, uh...  Yeah, so he was crying the whole way home.  That sounds...  Which is so...  Nightmarish to me.  Yeah.  It was nightmarish.  When it's your own kid crying...  We were discussing this after the fact.  It's your own kid crying.  If it was someone else's kid, I probably would have committed murder. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  There is a difference.  That's all I can tell you.  Yeah, I guess so.  Because when it's your kid crying, you just want to make them feel, you know, better.  Yeah.  It's hard to explain because you don't have a kid.  I know.  My friend...  And you have every right to think what you're thinking.  That is nightmarish.  No, no, I'm just...  No, you have every right to say that.  The thought of being in three hour traffic for an hour and a half drive is enough.  Right.  Then the rain.  Right.  And then, like, having the sound effects in the background with the kid crying.  But, like, that whole thing, to me, it, like, makes me anxious. 
[00:04:30]  And you have every right to think that.  Yeah.  I'm just defending the parents out there.  Oh, yeah.  Where you do know when it's your kid, you just...  All you care about is try to make them comfortable.  Especially when they're at a much, you know, younger age.  Yeah.  He doesn't know any better, but...  Benadryl.  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  Love those parents that are like, why are you slipping my Benadryl?  Well, I think our...  It's your dose in your kid.  But I think our parents did that to us, right?  Yeah.  My mom talks about the whiskey, the pacifier and the whiskey and all that crap.  Yeah.  And I don't think she was joking. 
[00:05:00]  Get him to sleep, whatever it takes.  She said it was great for when you were teething to put a little whiskey on your pacifier.  Whiskey.  Would you get arrested for that now?  Who would ever fucking come out, even as a doctor, because doctors would say that.  Right.  You put a little whiskey, bourbon on their...  Give him a little whiskey.  ...on the pacifier, it'll be fine for him.  Yeah.  As he's lighting up a cigarette in his office.  Yeah.  I don't know why the troopers needed to give tickets last night.  We're all going slow to begin with, so maybe some asshole decided to go up the side or something. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  But I'm looking at this car going, why is he getting a ticket right now?  Because everyone is rubbernecking and it's already a nightmare out here.  Because broke-ass Jersey.  Yeah.  Broke-ass Jersey needs money, so...  Yeah.  So, yeah, fuck, man.  That was a rough one.  That was rough.  And you just have to concentrate too much.  So, like, every hour you're awake driving like that is two hours of normal activity.  Yeah.  Because you're so focused, you've got to drive, eh, be careful. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, you've got ridiculous focus.  Yeah.  Because you're trying to make moves.  You're like, can I get over there?  Is that going to do something?  You're looking five, six cars ahead.  And then the New Jersey Turnpike splits and then you have to make that fucking decision  of life.  The fateful decision.  Do people understand this out there?  When you're coming up from the south on the New Jersey Turnpike, it splits into two,  three, four-lane highways.  Four lanes?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  Four-lane highways.  Are you going to take the left or are you going to go right?  They both go to the same place.  Right.  But one is like kind of express. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And one is kind of local exits.  Yeah.  And you never know like for the most part.  Which one's going to move better.  There could be a problem on one and the worst part is sitting in dead stop traffic on one.  Yeah.  And they give you a clear view of the other one.  Of course.  They're very close.  Of course.  And you're just looking at cars doing 80.  Yeah.  And you're like, what?  And you're thinking if I made that decision.  Yeah.  I would be fucking nice right now.  Coin toss.  Yeah.  Coin toss.  Whoops.  I fucked up.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You always end up in the express lane because that just makes more sense to the local. 
[00:07:00]  Express seems fast.  Because if you're looking, you see signs, you go, oh, express or local.  Well, I obviously want the express lane.  I want to go express.  And then you realize it's worse.  How does a 10 car pile up?  But no, do you know what's better too?  Trucking car lanes is better than just car lanes.  Yeah.  Y'all take that to the bank.  Motherfuck.  Yeah.  But they're sick with that shit because they don't tell you which one is the good one.  No.  You make that decision every time.  Sometimes you're like, I fucking did it right.  It's harrowing when you have to make it. 
[00:07:30]  You're thinking, ah, ah.  So guess what?  Last night I made it wrong.  I went left.  You chose unwisely.  I went left.  It was, right.  Left is express, right?  Right.  And my wife doesn't like when I fucking decide, well, I made the wrong decision, so now I  have to get to the right decision, which is a completely illegal move.  Illegal, but great move.  But all of a sudden I pull onto the shoulder and she knew like, all right, look, he's in  his own world.  Let him go.  I'm going for it.  And I'm just looking.  These cars are zipping by because I'm 10 miles an hour on the left. 
[00:08:00]  The right is easily going 75.  I'm like, I need to be over there.  So I had to fucking make some moves to, you know.  Sure.  What are they called?  They give you a couple chances to fucking change lanes.  Illegally, of course.  Illegal.  Because there's signs all over the place.  Do not fucking do that.  Don't pull that shit.  And they say it.  Do not fucking do what you're thinking.  But I did what I was fucking thinking and saved myself probably another hour.  Probably. 
[00:08:30]  What's worse though, what's worse than when you make that decision and then you're just  like, I fucking knew it.  Yeah.  It's like there's two girls at the bar and you hit on one and she stands up and she's  a fat pig and the fucking, and the 10 leaves.  You could have had me.  Oh, shit.  But all fucking night long, man.  That's worse than looking at like, uh, like, uh, my droid.  I can't, I can't see shit right now. 
[00:09:00]  I realize there are some days you wake up and like someone, it feels like you have arc  burn in your eyeballs and someone threw handfuls of sand in your face.  Yeah.  And you're, and then you're like, Oh, what the fuck?  Oh yeah.  I was texting for like fucking two hours straight.  I do feel like sand was rubbed in my eyes.  You're absolutely right.  That's that, that's the feeling I got right now and I'm the idiot because I'm thinking  Easter Sunday, how hard could it be?  Right?  I forget every year that Easter Sunday could be worse than the Christmas holidays as far 
[00:09:30]  as coming back home.  Thanksgiving's really bad too.  Right.  That's a bad one.  Any holiday where people go to other people's house for dinner is gonna suck ass.  And it does, I was saying, I used to drive home from exit 63 on the expressway when I  lived in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and a three hour drive.  Yeah.  At least three hours.  And meanwhile, I've done it in, in an hour.  Yeah.  Maybe slightly over.  Yeah.  It's just, yeah.  It's crazy.  How was the, uh, the Easter?  You guys do anything? 
[00:10:00]  Well, I know Jimmy with Ozzy.  I saw him tweeting it.  Well, Ozzy.  Yeah.  Of course.  What else is there?  Nothing.  Did he get anyone to go with you?  You saw, you saw your own Jesus, your own Lord and Savior on Easter.  It was an amazing Easter.  Yeah.  While you were all looking for eggs.  I was, I was chatting with, I was having a nice chat with Ozzy.  You guys didn't know that.  Nice.  To chat with him.  That is nice.  Yeah.  I took this chick I know, uh, Rolanda.  She's, uh, she's cool.  Fuck it.  White.  Mexican.  Mexican?  Yeah.  You forced him to go.  Actually, what has he got going on? 
[00:10:30]  I didn't ask him.  I just said that he, he actually texted me.  He said, do you have anybody to go with?  I'm like, no.  Because everybody's doing family shit.  And, uh, he's like, I'll go.  Yeah, that's stupid family shit.  Nah, but I got it.  I mean, it was, it was, it is what it was, but it was, it was like, I know it's a major  holiday, so, I mean.  Easter's one of the biggies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a bunch of holidays that certainly would blow off, but Easter's.  Easter, you can't.  And I was, uh, it was done right.  It was, it was an amazing fucking event, of course.  Yeah.  And, uh, 6 p.m., perfect start time.  And I get there, and this is, this is why I fucking love this family. 
[00:11:00]  Every single person in the media has on the shirt that I'm wearing right now.  They had a, it was done in a thousand seat venue, and every fucking chair had a God  Bless Ozzy Osbourne shirt on it.  Ooh.  And a fucking badge, and a fucking little, every single person got something when they  left.  And when you walk in, because Tribeca is all over the city.  All over, they're doing premieres, and blah, blah, blah.  This one was an absolute fucking Aussie rock vibe, and it was like, no other premiere did  anything that resembled that. 
[00:11:30]  It's like, literally, when the premiere's over, you forget who was just in the room.  Mm-hmm.  Really, really smart, uh, PR people around.  Yeah.  Fucking bright.  That's great.  So, uh, it was, it was, it was great.  It was really nice, and, uh, De Niro was there.  Is it a soft shirt, Jimmy?  Yes.  I washed it last night first before we went to that.  Very, very soft.  It is.  It needs to be soft.  But I hate those black shirts that are, that are just like, I feel like, I feel like  fucking insulation.  He scared me.  Yeah, that's a good looking shirt there, Jimmy.  And I didn't get to talk to De Niro. 
[00:12:00]  He walked the red carpet, and I saw him as he walked by, but he, I think he left right  after, so I went back to try to meet him.  I think he's too busy being pissed at Trump at this point.  De Niro?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Yeah, he's, he's not appreciating Donald Trump doing the birther thing with Obama or something.  That was Seinfeld.  I know, I didn't know De Niro had the same problem.  Oh, De Niro's involved a little bit.  Oh, okay.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah, it was a Seinfeld thing.  I mean, Trump knows how to just piss people off.  Well, you know what it was, too.  It's like, we're back in that area, and I see the family, and I introduce myself to Jack, 
[00:12:30]  and Ozzy's just standing there by himself.  I just spilled a little over my phone.  And I'm like, I don't want to bother him, but I'm like, go bother him.  Fuck, it's Ozzy.  And so I just started talking to Sharon, and I kind of felt bad, and then he just kind  of looks at me, and he's like, how you been?  Nice.  Oh.  And we just started chatting about sleep.  Look at you.  That was wonderful.  It was my Easter gift.  That was just a regular chat with two men.  We said hello walking in, and then I think he takes a second because his memory is so  bad.  He's got a really bad memory, yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Did he say, I was hoping you brought my birthday gifts with you today?  Books?  No, he didn't mention the books.  He didn't mention the books?  No, he neglected to mention the books.  I think his shame about leaving them was just tarnishing the event.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Too great?  For everyone.  Yeah.  But yeah, we had a nice chat about fucking sleep disorders for a couple of minutes.  Oh, really?  And it's time for a fucking movie.  Could talk for hours.  And the movie?  Amazing.  Really?  I mean, what am I going to say?  Because it's Ozzy, but it really was.  Bladder saw it.  Steve Leeds was there.  And Roland, none of our who are really Ozzy fans. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And Roland said it was great.  He's like, I wanted it to suck so I could make fun of you.  But it was very, some of it was really touching.  And it was great.  It was so well done.  And Jack has access to all the footage.  Oh, yeah.  Is it Ozzy's life?  It's his life.  They cover everything.  I mean, I knew, but there was a lot of footage I've never seen before.  Oh, wow.  I think that they tried to avoid dealing with some of the stuff on the Osbournes.  Like, they only glanced over Sharon's cancer.  Just because I think they didn't want to just show you the same stuff you saw on the Osbournes. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  It was Ozzy was fucking hilarious in it.  Yeah.  He's a funny dude, man.  Yeah.  We both said that, right?  Yeah.  But he was, he got killed in the theater.  Yeah.  So it was really great, man.  It was great.  I was very happy that they did such a good job with it.  Good for Ozzy.  I never would have bashed it anyway.  Where are they going to show this movie?  I don't know.  It's actually, I want to ask that to Jack when he comes in.  Like, what's the next step?  Because it was, people loved it.  It was, it's good.  I don't know if you can put it in theaters or do you sell it to the IFC or HBO?  What do you do with it?  That's a great question.  Yeah.  I'm wondering where the documentary, Anderson Silva too. 
[00:14:30]  I saw his documentary.  I loved it.  It's like, what do you do with the documentary?  But it's, but it doesn't matter as much these days, right?  I don't think so.  Because, I mean, we can just put it on our iPads and shit.  Just get it, get it out there somewhere and people will find it.  Or go to DVD and then show extra footage.  When we were growing up, man, if they didn't put a movie in a theater, that movie was fucked.  You didn't see it.  You didn't see it.  You didn't see it anywhere.  You didn't see it until it ended up on Channel 5.  There was probably some great movies that just didn't get the distribution.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Good for you.  Thank you.  We're going to have Jack Osborne in at 8.30.  Yes.  And now we have Dimitri Martin at 9.30 and Anderson Silva at 7.45.  Damn.  To the show.  And we've got a very busy show.  Crazy.  What was I going to say?  Oh, God.  Can I, one thing I forgot?  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you for rolling.  Well, I was hoping for more from you about this lousy thing.  Well, this is, rolling's a fun date.  This was your big night.  Yeah, I know.  But it's like, we were going to talk to Jack.  So I figured I would just, you know.  Oh, you're saving it.  Okay.  But afterwards, we go to the parking lot.  And it was like, you know, a half block away. 
[00:15:30]  Everything worked out perfectly.  And we go to the, oh, Roland's here.  And so fucking, we go to the, Marky Ramon was there.  And he's one, you know, the guy's a legend.  He's one of the fucking Ramones.  Ramones.  And I didn't want to bother him for a photo at the premiere.  Because again, I'm just too busy, like, looking for De Niro and shit.  But we're walking into the parking deck.  And there's Marky Ramon.  Just him walking to him.  I'm like, I have to ask him for a photo now.  And he was very cool.  I'm like, how you doing?  He's like, I got to piss.  I'm like, oh, can I have a picture?  And then I'm like, I hand Roland the camera.  And it's kind of fumbling. 
[00:16:00]  And we can't get the flash.  Oh, no.  But he's really patient and cool.  And he's like, yeah, no problem, man.  No problem.  And we take the photo.  And then he goes to Roland.  You want a shot?  And Roland's like, no, I'm okay.  And it was so fucking awkward.  I'm like, dude.  We walk around.  I'm like, couldn't you have just said yes?  You just say yes at that point.  He has an arm ready for me.  I'm like, I'm good.  Oh, my God.  It's one of the Ramones.  Dude, it was so.  And he goes, who is that?  I didn't know who he was.  I'm not a big fan of the Ramones. 
[00:16:30]  But you've got to get that picture every time.  That's a Ramone.  It was fucking.  It was so uncomfortable.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  And then the guy gets into his car.  And I had left one of the little Aussie places.  Blackard's, well, we got the photo.  So Roland had to walk back.  And he was looking at him.  And I was like, dude, just ask him for a picture.  Now at the point, I think he wanted him to ask.  You want a shot?  No, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Why would you say that?  I didn't know who he was.  I'm good.  Oh.  Oh, he does a show here?  I'm hearing. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I think he is here.  He's here a lot.  How was the movie, Roland?  It was really good.  It surprised me.  You're not an Aussie fan in general?  Not at all.  Not at all?  I mean, I just don't, it's not my cup of tea, but I mean, it was really good.  I wish the Bruce documentary was like this one.  Because it's really informative.  Really?  Yeah.  It goes back to his early years as his baby and shows everything.  They did like a full documentary.  It was pretty rough too.  If you see some scenes.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Yeah.  Some of the stuff that was said.  Really?  Yeah.  It wasn't.  He looks really good in it and really funny, but it's very fucking honest. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, there are some things that were said by the kids about him not being a good  father.  And yeah, I mean, really like, oof.  It was not a fucking just Aussie propaganda machine at all.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a real documentary.  It was like it was done by somebody who had nothing to do with the family.  It was fucking great.  I would go see him on a concert because all the concert scenes were pretty cool.  Yeah, concert footage was amazing.  Oh, I've been to a concert with Jimmy.  You ever went to see him?  Nope.  He puts on a great show.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  He's doing more time now than he did fucking 10 years ago. 
[00:18:00]  He's doing over two hours now.  He's doing like an hour and 20.  Jesus.  And then he'd probably go in the back and tip a few.  Poor guy.  Is he tipping these days?  No, he's sober fucking a few years.  A few years now.  Five years now?  Yeah.  Probably.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did it all right with Jimmy?  Yeah.  He had a good time.  He didn't fuck up with his picture taken or anything like that?  No, De Niro just went.  Yeah, he zipped through.  I was fucking.  Isn't it his film festival?  No, no, no.  He did the Red Carver,  but he had two other ones to go to.  He had three.  He's trying to go from city to city. 
[00:18:30]  I got you.  I mean, from theater to theater.  All over the city, right?  Yeah, I think he tries to hit them all and get a picture.  Just for a picture.  Right, right.  I was fucking crying that I didn't get him.  He looked all happy and handsome.  Yeah.  Yeah, once again, I saw him.  I was like, Bob De Niro!  And I'm like, fuck.  It's gone.  Bob.  He eludes me again.  And of course, everybody on Twitter is Bob.  Did you get a picture?  Did he blow you off?  He didn't blow me off.  But no, I didn't get a picture.  Fucks.  One day.  I'm going to have one.  And by the end of the Tribeca Film Festival, I will have a picture.  We got a guy, Steve.  He was there last night.  Yes.  Question for Jimmy. 
[00:19:00]  Question for Jimmy.  Steve, what's up?  Yes, hello.  It's at the Bear Festival.  Thank you.  Hi, buddy.  Jimmy.  Yes.  What did you think of the commentary with Paul McCartney?  I was kind of distracted by the fact that he looked like a 96-year-old woman.  Well, he's McCartney.  I mean, he's probably had a little bit of work done.  But I know from one time, Johnny and I, which is what Ozzy's brother calls him, were talking.  And he had mentioned that Jack got McCartney to be interviewed for him.  And McCartney obviously knew the music and knew what the influence of Sabbath had been 
[00:19:30]  and how he said how weird it was to have these dark things.  It was good.  McCartney was great.  But another thing I like is that they didn't stay on anybody overdue.  They talked a little bit.  Tommy Lee told the fucking funniest story in the documentary.  A really funny story.  That was fucking great.  Tommy Lee was great in the documentary.  And Jack talked a little.  Kelly, Ozzy's first two children, Lewis, I don't remember his daughter's name, and Amy looked fucking amazing.  And it was really, it was spread out beautifully.  It wasn't, I wanted it to be longer. 
[00:20:00]  I was like, fuck, man, this should be like another hour.  Ozzy's brother, you said?  He's a brother.  I never knew he had a brother.  And I never heard his first daughter speak from his first marriage.  Never.  What does Ozzy's brother do for a living?  I know, he's probably guessing he's in the business.  I love finding that shit out.  When someone's really famous and they have a brother or a sister, what do they do?  What do they do?  His name is Paul Osborne, which made me like him.  Paul Osborne.  Yay.  They did show Ozzy's library full of Beatles books.  Oh, dude.  There was one thing where they show the Beatles books.  Oh, no.  And they fucking pan over the one he told me that he had. 
[00:20:30]  So he really, he was right.  He wasn't lying.  It's violent Beatles books.  Where are, where's Ozzy's Beatles books these days?  In the office.  Yeah.  Those are very valuable at this point.  Yeah, well, Ozzy will get them.  And I'm going to bring it up to Jack, too.  Just to tell him he has a gift coming.  How about you give him to Jack to give to Ozzy?  No, because he has a fucking press to do all day.  I have to hand them to Ozzy.  I want to hand him to Ozzy wrapped.  Make him unwrap them again.  Yeah, make him unwrap them.  Oh, this is wonderful.  I have this one.  Well, it was a great night, guys.  And I'm glad you had a good time, Jimmy. 
[00:21:00]  Thank you.  Very cool.  I was talking to some guy from the band Hatebreed.  Who was really cool, too.  I don't know the, I know them.  I know the name.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell you a song.  It was really fun, man.  Good night.  But it was really, it was like everybody, when it comes to Ozzy stuff now, you feel like  taken care of now.  And like, I don't feel like I'm not going to get back.  You know that fucking shit feeling you have going backstage?  But you're part of the family at this point.  No, I'm not.  Ozzy just barely remembers my face.  Is he part of the family?  Yeah, because he went back right behind him backstage to talk to Ozzy. 
[00:21:30]  I went to get ice cream.  Yeah, but Roland is a fun guy to fucking go to these things with because he so doesn't  give a shit about, like, I'm like, Ozzy was by himself and I'm like, I just couldn't  bother him.  But I talked to, I went into the men's room the same time he did.  It wasn't really intentional.  Oh, no.  Yeah, he was on one end.  I stood on the other end.  Oh, he probably thought it was intentional.  I don't know if he did or not.  Did he see you in there?  No, but I just, I walked in.  He was there.  I saw Tony Dennis.  Like, but I had to piss.  I didn't get up to piss once.  And I was like, hi, I was like, great job.  And I just went and pissed ashamed. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're following me in the fucking bathroom.  Yeah.  I always do something that's kind of, like, humiliating on some level.  I can never just be completely comfortable.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was a fun, it was a fun fucking event.  Sounds it.  Roland, let's see this damn thing.  Let's see this damn thing.  Roland, can I get a copy of this?  Or we have to go to a theater and see it?  You can probably get one.  Yeah, probably after the next showing.  When's the next showing?  This morning, actually.  There's a press showing this morning.  What time?  Let's go.  Nah, it's early.  It's like nine.  Oh, fuck this place.  Let's go. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  I don't think that's washing.  No.  I don't think we're going to be going.  Why, man?  I'm tired.  My shirt's a little itchy.  I washed it, too.  My skin is so delicate.  It is a little itchy?  Yeah, I mean, I understand why people want to come all over.  It looks soft, though.  I'll say it again.  Those black fucking shirts that feel like you're wearing, like, insulation.  Yeah, yeah.  Very, very coarse.  With a tight collar.  Yeah, yeah.  With a little tighter on your neck.  I hate it.  And it feels like your body has, like, a little tingling buzz on it, and that's the  insulation.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, you just need a nice, soft shirt every fucking time.  This is not bad.  Thank God I washed it, or I would have been fucking Irving itchy.  But how fucking great was it to walk in and see all those shirts, and it was like a concert  vibe.  And I'm like, what smart fucking people.  I guarantee it's from showering.  I get a shirt, and then I go, here you go, Jimmy.  He goes, oh, thank you.  Everybody was fucking nice.  And I was like, oh, of course I'm panicking.  Like, I'm not going to get one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I realized I'm on every seat, fag.  Like, fuck's the matter with you?  Everybody gave me his.  But you could, I could see how you would think, like, it wouldn't be on your seat, and you'd 
[00:23:30]  have to be like, can I get a shirt?  Well, we don't have any.  And you'd just be like, ah, figures.  Yeah.  I've been there.  I know what that's like.  I finally felt nice.  Humiliating.  Yeah, backstage, they treat me really nice.  It was so nice to fucking have one good hookup, but it's the best one I could have.  Well, that'll be ruined the next time you go backstage, by the next event.  Whatever the next event is, is going to be fucked.  Of course I will.  It'll be horrendous.  It'll probably be at Tribeca.  Yeah.  I predict that by the time that fucking film festival is over. 
[00:24:00]  Why am I not doing any of these Tribeca things at all?  Dude, you should.  They're fun.  Give me a list.  I want to check out some of these films.  It's already over.  No, it's not.  I just said it wasn't.  You've got to listen before you do your fucking show.  As much as I know he lies, he gets me every time with that.  I know.  Oh, here's why Roland is a piece of shit.  I was like fucking, he's like,  yeah, you didn't get your De Niro picture.  I'm like, yeah, but he came right through and Roland said,  yeah, but somebody got one.  I was like, yeah, you're right.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to point it out.  Way to go, Roland.  Somebody got one.  Way to go.  He said shit. 
[00:24:30]  It really is garbage.  Hey, I was talking to Ant before the show,  and it looks like you were enjoying some playoff hockey, my friend.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Travis was over the house.  I can't even look at him.  I'm sorry, Travis.  I just want to say.  He was.  I can't even look at you.  He was so into it.  I'm just watching his Canadians, or Habs, as he calls them,  playing the Beasts, playing Boston.  And, of course, they went into double overtime, 
[00:25:00]  and he was just at the edge of his seat,  or my couch, as it were.  And it was brutal to watch.  He's just freaking out.  But he's not a loud fan.  Like, I was sitting there going,  Come on.  Oh!  You don't even know either team, and you were getting into it.  But it was just action-packed, you know?  I'm telling you.  Action-packed.  Nothing beats playoff hockey.  When you have a team in it, oh, my God.  It's the greatest thing ever.  But he just sat there, like, like,  and I could tell, though, he was freaking out. 
[00:25:30]  Of course.  He wouldn't talk to anybody, and he's just kind of,  his head's moving around.  At any moment, the game's over.  Yeah, and it was, because I went upstairs,  and I'm looking over the edge of the balcony,  so I could see kind of the couch and the TV.  I'm just kind of watching.  And then, you know, whoosh.  And you just saw, before that puck even went in,  you went like,  Oh, there's a giant gaping hole that the goalie is nowhere near.  And there's a shit before it even went in.  Yeah, yeah, you did.  You went, oh, shit.  And there's a gentleman with the puck right against his fucking stick. 
[00:26:00]  And that was it.  Wham-o.  Did your team get knocked out?  I don't follow.  Not yet, no.  No, no.  They lost a big game?  And they didn't get knocked out.  Yeah, it was a big game.  See, I didn't even know.  I thought it was the fucking final game.  Yeah, once you found out that no one would be eliminated that night.  So why am I watching this?  Then I was like, what am I doing?  I'm going to the jacuzzi.  Now the Canadians got to win two in a row, so.  They have to, yeah.  It's been done before.  Dude, I have to say, this sports curse of mine is really strange.  I fucking, I did three overtime games, 
[00:26:30]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I guess, right?  One a day.  And I fucking mispicked.  You undermined every team.  Oh, for three.  Well, there were two yesterday.  Huh?  There were two yesterday.  Which games?  The Flyers game and...  Oh, the Chicago game.  Yeah.  Another overtime game, right?  Jesus, what the fuck's going on with the overtime?  There's been 11 so far.  Wow.  In the first round.  Is that some kind of record?  I don't think so.  I'm not sure.  There's a lot of fucking, uh... 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  This was Friday night.  I tweeted, another great hockey game.  Flyers-Sabers tied.  Heading to OT.  Flyers got this.  Two minutes later, the Sabers...  Whoops.  ...beat the fucking Flyers.  And then, uh...  And then I went with the Boston game.  Playoff hockey is the best.  I wrote, absolutely.  Canadians have this tonight.  Yeah, they have it, all right.  That was...  They had the loss.  The loss, yes.  Right.  Very, very, yes.  Oh, and then the guy gets mad at me. 
[00:27:30]  He goes, come on, Ope.  Remember your Boston days?  Go Bruins.  And I write, I want the Bruins, but obviously it's the Canadians' night.  Oh.  And then the Canadians lost in overtime.  I couldn't even text Travis.  I just left him alone.  Notice I left you alone.  I didn't touch you.  Yeah, and I tried to do the furthest thing from Opie that I could, which was watch the  game at Anthony's house.  Oh, my God.  And Travis is, like, so fixated on the game, his daughter's running around my house with  a pen. 
[00:28:00]  I'm like...  I'm trying to pay attention to both things.  Yeah, yeah.  Careful.  I can tell enough.  Oh.  Playoff hockey over your daughter, right?  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Kids like, right, because I don't have a kid-friendly house.  She's running around, like, pulling shit off the tables and stuff.  And Anthony's being Mr. Annoying Question Guy.  Yeah, well, during the playoffs, during some of the most exciting parts of the game, I  had to ask Travis hockey questions.  Don't do that. 
[00:28:30]  He was getting so annoyed at me.  It was great.  Don't do that.  That was fantastic.  What's icing?  Can you explain icing?  That's icing.  That's icing, right?  Can you explain it?  Half the time, he would say, well, here comes icing.  It would be icing.  He's just saying, I knew it was icing.  It's, like, so ridiculous.  Why is there only a four-on-four right now?  I go, what happened to the red line?  I remember there used to be a red line or something.  How many years ago now?  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  Yeah.  It was a tough game to watch.  It was a very tough game.  Well, the end was tough to watch. 
[00:29:00]  The rest of the game was great.  And then yesterday, someone asked me, who you got today?  Oh, Flyers or Sabres?  And I write, sorry, but Ryan Miller looks unstoppable.  Sabres got this today.  Whoops.  0 for 3 with the fucking OTs.  0 for 3.  People are now betting against my picks.  Are they?  Making some money?  They're begging me to pick games, and then they're going opposite at this point.  Who won last night with the Chicago thing?  Chicago.  Chicago won that?  First game seven.  Wow.  Vancouver was up 3-0, like, in the series. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  Cool.  They've come all the way back.  Right on.  Yeah.  Did you enjoy your playoff hockey?  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought it was pretty exciting.  And you got the nice system over there.  Yeah, yeah.  Watched it upstairs, but the TV is fucking great for sports.  It's, like, crazy.  It looked, and it just was, like, it was action-packed, man.  I was commenting also, of course, much to his chagrin, that, like, not as many whistles  as I used to see when I used to watch, like, hockey.  Well, they don't want... 
[00:30:00]  They're like, wow, that's a penalty.  There's a penalty.  Like, every time something would happen where it wasn't just skating and moving the puck  around, I'd be like, that's got to be called.  Travis just, like, shut up.  I appreciate that the refs just stay out of it, man, and let these guys beat the shit  out of each other.  You know, as long as it's not some blatant fucking penalty, they let them go for the  most part.  And I think the players play a little more careful, because they know what, you know.  Sometimes they get a stick in there, though.  Wham!  When it's very obvious, of course, they're going to call it. 
[00:30:30]  But, yeah, you could watch this play of hockey and see a lot of penalties they're not calling,  which I love.  Do that in the regular season.  And then my other favorite thing was, he's in the crease!  Punch him in the fucking face!  There you go.  And Travis is just like, oh, God, would he shut the fuck up?  Anthony loves it when it's in the zone, and when you get it out of the zone.  Yes, clearing it is great.  The power play was great, because it was like, clear it!  Clear it!  There it is!  That's where hockey has changed.  If you have the tip of your skate in the crease, you're going to lose your teeth. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Punch him in the fucking face!  Even if it was by accident, if he was pushed by the other team into the crease, he still gets  beat up.  Doesn't matter.  He gets his shit beat up.  Oh, yeah.  And it's not even, it's even close to the crease at this point.  And if you're a couple feet away, they're going to fuck with it.  It's fantastic.  Oh, really?  You want to come this close, or are you going to lose your teeth?  That was good.  It's up to you.  It was good.  I enjoyed myself watching that.  And it's much different than regular season.  I'm going to say it again.  It's the only sport that is drastically different when the playoffs hit. 
[00:31:30]  Drastically different.  I'll only watch playoffs then.  Although baseball is drastically different.  Those games turn out to be, what, six hours long when it's the playoffs?  Oh, yeah.  And the pitches will go longer.  They'll bring in starters to do relief.  Like, you'll see a lot of that, guys, coming in in the seventh that are supposed to start.  I had a shit.  I don't know why I had to say it and then explain.  But it started coming in a relief, man.  I should have said it once, but I felt like I had a good point.  There just wasn't enough words in it.  I had a shitty fucking sports weekend because the Knicks got knocked out, too.  They got swept by the Celtics. 
[00:32:00]  I don't think they were, I don't even know about basketball, but they weren't looking very  good during the playoffs from what I heard.  And the Celtics aren't.  The Celtics are not winning this fucking championship.  The Black Celtics?  And don't bet on that.  Trust me.  They're not winning the championship.  Aye, a bunch of, just, just a bunch of Irish guys on, on, on the court.  Don't, don't count Oklahoma out.  Oh.  What?  There's a team in Oklahoma now and they look pretty fucking good in the playoffs.  Don't count them out.  Don't count Chicago out.  Don't just assume it's going to be the Lakers or the fucking heat.  I'll tell you right now. 
[00:32:30]  But the stupid Knicks haven't won a playoff game.  They had it in the paper today.  They haven't won a playoff game in 10 years now.  Wow.  Even the Islanders, who have been shitty for a long time, have won playoff games in the  last 10 years.  It was in the paper today.  It shows all the teams and the Yankees, of course, have the most playoff wins in the  last 10 years.  Well, yeah.  For New York teams.  Of course.  And the fucking Knicks have still not won one playoff game in 10 years.  And that was the first time they were in the playoffs in seven years. 
[00:33:00]  And they blew it, so.  I don't know if they blew it, but.  Yeah, but your Mets swept the Diamondbacks, so it wasn't a total loss.  Mets got a four-game winning streak.  Yeah.  Four games, huh?  Yes.  Yeah, they're what?  Eight and 13?  Something like that?  Nine or ten wins.  Get back in it, then.  I'm not.  You know, Holiday had a fucking game down there in Philly.  Fucking Phillies are the best team in baseball.  In baseball.  And you're.  Nine and 13.  You're not the worst team ever.  Nine and 13.  And your Dirk Jeter is 55 hits away from 3,000. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's going to be one of these big moments.  That's got to be a big deal for you Yankees fans.  Big moments.  They almost blew it.  Yankees.  Jesus Christ.  They've been keeping track of the papers since spring training.  Yeah, I know, right?  Isn't it amazing that Pete Rose has over 1,000 hits more?  Like, that's how fucking good Pete Rose was.  Jeter's amazing.  And Rose had over 1,000 more hits.  He has more hits than anyone.  Yeah, well, I know.  I'm saying 4,000-something.  Oh, yeah?  I'll bet she doesn't.  Get it?  That's because Pete Rose crouched down and slapped at that stupid ball. 
[00:34:00]  He was one of those slap hitters.  Yeah.  How many fucking singles did he have?  Him and Rod Carew should fucking jerk each other off in a booth.  Stupid Rod Carew.  I'm Charlie Hustle.  Yeah, I'm Rod Carew.  Charlie Hustle.  Remember Rod Carew choking up on that bat and just slapping at the ball?  It drove people nuts.  He was my favorite player for a while.  Why?  I just loved Rod Carew.  Loved him.  Really?  Loved him because he was, I don't know, he was just great.  I don't know.  They'd say he used the entire field.  Oh, really?  They would never say that. 
[00:34:30]  No, they would.  We would all think it, but anyone that said it was immediately humiliated sexually.  Did he ever have a double, Rod Carew?  Or was it all just slap singles?  Just singles?  Slap singles?  Slap, slap, slap, slap.  I think he played for 18 years and he has seven career home runs.  And two doubles and one triple.  Eight balls hit out of the infield, actually.  Because the guy was daydreaming in right field.  His fucking slap hitter shit.  I know, but he was fucking really hard to get out.  It's like Tony Gwynn.  And not only did he slap at the ball, he made sure, like, he bounced it really high. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  So they didn't have a...  Hard to field.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You didn't even have a chance at fielding it before Rod Carew was past first base.  Ball took a bad hop.  You had two feet in front of him.  Yeah, exactly.  A little squib.  I think they invented the word squib for Rod Carew.  Another squib for Rod Carew.  Travis, what do you think of your Canadians?  You think they're going to do this or what?  I have to think they're going to do this.  Where's the next game?  I don't even know.  In Montreal.  Montreal. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  But it's, you know.  But the home team's not winning this.  Boston was the first one to win, though, at home on Saturday.  A lot of fucking games not being won by the home team this year.  And that could have went either way there, Travis.  Could have gone either way.  Either way.  This is good sports talk.  Could have gone either way.  A lot of good opportunities, a lot of good missed opportunities, and some great goaltending  in that game.  That's what I saw.  I think they'll pull it out, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Stay close, Travis.  I've heard explanations about this, and I don't believe any of them. 
[00:36:00]  Rick will explain in Rockland.  Go ahead, Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Love you.  Love the show.  I wanted to ask Travis if Anthony was booing the black guy and the Canadians with the rest  of the Boston fans.  Well, the Boston fans sure do like to boo their black guys.  Well, now, Travis, you're going to have to explain this for all the Canadians fans out  there.  I guess Saban?  Is that right?  Okay, Saban.  Saban.  Okay.  I wanted to say his name correctly.  Saban, he's a black player for the Canadians, and he's damn good. 
[00:36:30]  And everyone hates him.  And every time he touched a puck in Boston, they were booing him.  Boom!  It's a racist thing.  Yeah, but it's like that everywhere.  Why do they hate him so much?  Because he's a rookie, and he's very cocky, and he'll hit people, and he'll start shit.  And I think a lot of players don't respect that he's very new to the game and very cocky  for what he's done so far.  Yeah, that must be why in Boston they boo him when he's on the ice. 
[00:37:00]  It definitely doesn't have to do with his race.  It doesn't have anything to do with the race, right?  No.  Is he good, though?  Yeah, he's very good, yeah.  But yeah, I mean, in New York, they'll boo him every time he gets to the puck at the  Garden, and in Boston.  Just because he's that cocky, but wow, I didn't know that.  That's hilarious.  I was thinking it has to be racist Boston.  Yeah, of course.  It has to be.  It would be funnier.  You made it easy for racist Boston, man.  Yeah.  No, the whole league does this.  Yeah, exactly.  He's a hateable guy if you're not a Canadians fan.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know much about him. 
[00:37:30]  Do you like him?  Yes, I do.  Very much.  How come you don't dislike his cockiness?  Well, did you bury him?  Because he's on my team.  If he wasn't on my team, I'd say, ah, cocky motherfucker.  Is he worse than Avery?  No.  No one's worse than Avery.  Avery's a cunt.  Yeah.  And you can say that now, Rangers fans, because I don't think that he's coming back.  Avery's a twat.  And you're right.  If he was on the Islanders, I'd fucking love a player like that.  But he's not on my team, so he's a fucking twat.  Rangers done.  That's it.  Yeah, the Caps knocked him out. 
[00:38:00]  Yep.  That's all I know.  I've totally exhausted all of my sports.  Are you going to watch more players hockey?  I'll probably watch the Canadiens games now.  Like, just during, you know.  Don't want me to watch.  You don't want me to watch?  You're bad luck now, too.  No, no.  I want bad luck, too.  You'll be tweeting us.  I'll get up and be watching.  That'll be fun.  We can tweet.  Yeah, let's all get together and watch your Canadiens.  Yeah, I'm going to watch and tweet.  Where do you want to see the game?  I'm going to watch it alone in my room and just...  No, man. 
[00:38:30]  I'll come over.  I'll come over.  Nah, you know, my place is a mess.  The kids can have a play date and we'll watch hockey together.  We're moving.  We got, you know, boxes everywhere.  I think it's fun if we just watch it at our various locations.  And tweet them?  We tweet everything.  Yeah, can we do that?  Yeah.  Sure, we can do that.  No, he'll just put his Twitter down.  Why don't you go to Ope's house or something like that?  It's right here in the city.  Oh.  He's got a big four-bedroom.  You can bring the kids over with a kid and hang on.  There you go.  He truly believes on bad luck.  Yes, I do.  You have bad luck.  Oh, yeah.  No, I know.  Maybe watching it with him would destroy the luck. 
[00:39:00]  You willing to take that chance?  I could.  I'll do anything at this point.  You believe that I'm cursing your team at this point?  I do believe you're not on my side.  Consciously or subconsciously?  The anger people threw at me on Twitter, though, just because I'm picking games that aren't  coming true.  Very serious.  They're like, just fucking don't say my team's name.  Yeah, they don't even want you mentioning the name.  They're so mad.  I'm like, come on.  You really think I have anything to do with this in the end?  I would love to think I have that power.  There's something going on. 
[00:39:30]  There is something going on there.  Jordan, very excited that we mentioned Rod Carew in the first hour of the show today.  Well, a lot of people have criticized me.  Like, I'm typically a third to fourth hour show Rod Carew mentioned guy.  And everyone has, like, Twittered me about that and emailed me, like, dude, how about  the first hour?  And I said, I'm going to start doing it.  Can we turn this into Rod Carew Day?  I don't know if I would go that extreme.  I would wait until his birthday, where I would like to celebrate the anniversary of his  11th hit.  I don't know.  Yeah, so get on Google and see what it was. 
[00:40:00]  I bet it's today.  That would be odd.  All right, Matt in Boston wants to explain some shit.  Go ahead, Matt.  We don't like them because they're different than us.  Oh, sorry.  What, Matt?  The black guy from Canadians, I don't even want to say his name.  I fucking hate him.  He's a piece of shit because he wears a face shield and he starts shit.  And nobody's going to jack him in his black mouth.  Jack him in his black mouth.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That face shield, man. 
[00:40:30]  If you're going to start shit, you've got to take that whole fucking helmet off.  He doesn't wear a face shield.  What is this guy talking about?  Is that protocol?  There's a face shield right there.  I'm looking at a face shield picture right now.  I'm looking.  No, I'm talking about the entire mask.  Well, there's glass right there.  Are you just talking about the mask over his eyes?  A little plexiglass.  All right.  All right.  Misunderstanding.  I love...  You wear a full mask when you get your face broken and then you show up for the next game.  Like my boy, Marshawn.  Yeah.  He's a tough motherfucker. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  What's he wearing that glass over his eyes for?  You're right.  I agree with this guy.  Tons of players wear that.  Yeah, but this guy's starting shit.  But fair enough, you can still knock his teeth out.  As long as you got access to the jaw and the teeth, I think that's acceptable.  It's like a cartoon.  You wouldn't hit a man with glasses, would you?  And then they do.  I love the fucking real tough guys in hockey where it's obviously going to fight.  They're like, all right, let's do this.  They slowly take their fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  They take their helmet off.  They take their gloves off.  They roll up their sleeves.  You ready?  I'm ready.  Oh, nice.  Let's go. 
[00:41:30]  And then you got the one guy always that, oh, I didn't realize I was supposed to take  my helmet off.  Sorry, you got a broken hand.  You know?  I don't know, guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate PK Subban only has 727 fans on Facebook, so he can't be that bad a guy.  Well, he's going to get a few more now that you mentioned the site.  That wasn't smart on your part.  But it does not affect me personally.  Steve in Alabama's got...  Alabama, Steve!  Steve, he's going back to the traffic thing. 
[00:42:00]  Over three hours from...  Not even in Philly.  I'm north of...  Ah, whatever.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, guys.  I got an answer to all y'all's problems.  Yeah.  When you're traveling from Gig and Opie going from Philly all the time and his  drunk and stoopers and his Shelby...  Ma.  Y'all need to get a CB.  And Opie, just like last night, all you had to do was say southbound, what's going on,  and they would have told you.  Hey, southbound, what's going on? 
[00:42:30]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  I'm not getting a CB when I have Twitter.  I should have taken advantage of that.  I did that one time and people got mad at me at that because I go, hey, heading north  of the New Jersey Turnpike, someone tell me, you know, what's going on?  and then I get a thousand people telling me the same thing.  I didn't do that last night, though.  Fuck this CB.  That's old stuff.  I have a CB, actually.  You do?  You don't know how many times I've been on the damn turnpike going north,  and it's crazy.  Did he even hear that, you think? 
[00:43:00]  No, he's too busy thinking that we give a fuck about him and his truck and his CB.  Yeah.  How come you don't ask for my CB handle?  Yeah, Steve.  Yeah, I'll watch your CB handle.  I do have one.  But no, man, I've been on the dirt of the tide going slow, you know,  and I have a crazy...  He still thinks you give a fuck about traffic and trucks.  How come you don't want my CB handle, Steve?  How come nobody ever asks for my CB handle?  I've announced before that I have one.  Steve, he's got a CB handle.  He has got to be the CB kid.  No, I'm not, actually. 
[00:43:30]  What's your handle, Jimmy?  Clercston.  That's hard to ask for, I would think.  How do you spell that?  Clercston.  It's an H and L and R.  And then a U with the little fucking greater than sign over it.  There's six of them.  Six of them, huh?  And you're supposed to say,  Hello, Ernst.  You got your ears on, son?  Hey, I'm telling you, y'all.  Steve, we don't give a fuck about you, your truck, roads, or CBs. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  What is this?  1976?  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you have you a convoy?  Yeah, put the metal to the fucking pedal.  Can we get a little convoy for Steve?  He needs it today.  We got a little convoy.  There you go.  Yay.  We got a little convoy.  It's your beautiful sight.  I don't want to join our convoy.  It ain't that's going to get no way.  There, see?  We got a little convoy.  It's USA.  Convoy. 
[00:44:30]  Now, break your big friend this year.  Now, you want to back off them hogs?  Sorry.  Good.  Ten four.  About five miles or so.  Ten roger.  Them hogs get intense up here.  Break a break.  Hope you got your ears on.  We had 85.  Break a break for the bandit.  Block up on the clover.  No, this is a...  No, it's not.  What?  No.  What'd you say?  I said now it's good?  No, it sounded good.  But it's not.  That's not Johnny Cash. 
[00:45:00]  No, you're not.  I have my headphones off.  I put my other one on Sunday.  Johnny Cash would have never done this.  Well, I thought I wanted to hear it, at least.  Yeah.  If it was Johnny Cash, though, it wouldn't have sucked.  I couldn't.  I had to change my tune.  All right there, Steve.  Thank you.  And just so we have the info out there, NHL told the players they have to wear the half  shield, right?  As they're coming into the league?  I assume so, yeah.  But they got that grandfather thing for the older guys, I think?  Just like they did with the helmets.  Do they have to wear the shield now?  I think so, yeah.  I believe so.  It's just over your eyes. 
[00:45:30]  I heard that series was really good.  Oh, boy.  A shield joke?  Was that a shield joke?  No.  It was a shield statement that never should have been masquerading as human.  Let's say hi to Scott on Long Island.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  A little NHL trivia.  The first black player in the NHL was for Boston.  Yes.  You bring it up every black holidays and all like Martin Luther King Day, you get celebrated 
[00:46:00]  up there.  What's his name?  Oh, I have no idea.  I wouldn't remember.  What was his nickname?  I can only imagine.  Black Ice?  I thought it was about him before.  Black Ice.  Yeah, I know.  What was his name?  He had a good name.  Yeah.  Oh, Willie O'Ree.  Yeah.  There you go.  Willie O'Ree.  Motherfucker.  This guy wants me to tune in to AM radio to get the traffic report.  I knew what the traffic report was.  Easter Sunday, rain, heading to New York City. 
[00:46:30]  I think I can figure that one out.  You know, there's nothing you can do when you're driving.  It's like there's nothing.  The traffic isn't going to tell you a secret way.  And by the way, Opie, take...  Shh, shh, shh.  Don't tell anyone else.  I'm just talking to you.  Go up to the GWB.  Don't take the tunnels.  GWB's empty.  The Gothels had some backups.  The Gothels.  I hate when they call it the Gothels when they try to say it right.  The Gothels.  When Jeff McKay tries to say it right.  He says the Gothels. 
[00:47:00]  10-10 wins.  10-10 wins.  They all do it.  How is that good?  He does 10-10 and another one, but I hate when they do that.  They're like, you know, and traffic is reported by a Panasonic Jan Cam.  10-10 wins.  Why is that good?  I'm Judy DeAngelis.  So I guess I'm not the only one that actually repeats them back to themselves in my car the entire time.  Yes, that's right.  It's fun to kind of like talk along with the radio.  10-10 wins sports.  I hate it. 
[00:47:30]  The news.  The fucking typewriters.  Teletype.  That's why I didn't stop listening.  I could have taken it.  They just run a sound effect.  They tried taking it off once, years ago, and people complained.  People lost their minds.  So they keep a teletype like it's 1950.  It sounds like Jimmy Durante in the back.  That's so irritating.  Traffic and weather coming up next on the ones on 10-10 wins.  Everything has to fucking rhyme.  Everything has to have a name.  Traffic and weather. 
[00:48:00]  Together.  Yeah, traffic and weather together.  On the eights.  Yes.  Why do we need it on the eights?  Because it's 88.  I know that, but be simple.  That's too confusing.  Be simple.  Say 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 56 past the hour.  Four of the hour it'll be on.  Four of the hour.  Jimmy, can you handle this one for me?  Just checking my Twitter.  Sure.  Butcher without the T, 72.  Do you realize 90% of your audience is truck drivers and you sound like a giant pussy? 
[00:48:30]  But why?  Because we're making fun of CBs.  Get the joke, asshole.  I don't like, I wasn't making fun of CBs.  I have a handle.  I gave out my secret handle.  How old was your handle again?  I'm arksk.  It's amazing you remember that.  I don't know if I did.  I think it was pretty close.  Because I would know my handle is private.  I actually don't give it out to anybody.  Nobody has had it until today.  Well, then you're going to get a lot of people, a breaker breaker for the whole. 
[00:49:00]  You want people to break or break you on Twitter today?  No.  Give you some breaker breakers?  I certainly don't.  Why, man?  It'll be fun.  It won't be fun.  It'll be fun if a chick blew me.  That's fun.  That's a lot of fun.  But is this asshole really upset because we made fun of CBs?  Of course he is.  What's wrong with you?  You're listening to the wrong show, you idiot.  It's very lonely.  Go to the trucker channel.  On the road.  I love those guys.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Right.  Really, aren't you? 
[00:49:30]  What does over-the-road mean?  I have no idea why they say that.  I thought it was just assumed they used those tar strips all across the country.  Yeah, you know who's over-the-road?  Plains.  Yes.  Did you see the St. Louis fucking footage yet?  No.  The airport basically got destroyed.  It's going to be closed for, I think, two months.  From a tornado.  Oh, I heard.  Did you see?  They're showing it on TV all day today.  So, I mean, take a peek.  Yeah, it's a big one.  You see shit just flying all over the place inside the terminal.  Crazy.  What, a tornado hit? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, a tornado nailed him.  Wow.  Fucked up the airport.  You haven't seen this yet, Jimmy?  I have not.  It reminds me of my favorite song, though.  Why don't you meet me in St. Louis, Louis.  Meet me at the fair.  Do you remember that song?  No.  Why wouldn't we?  We used to sing that when I was a kid in Mrs. Jones' music class.  Why don't you meet me in St. Louis, Louis.  Meet me at the fair.  Fucking E-Roc's got it. 
[00:50:30]  Of course he does it in his iPod.  Is that Judy Garland?  It might be.  Yes.  She was singing to her bottle.  Meet me at St. Louis.  St. Louis.  How do you not like this?  This is so old-sounding.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Black people listen to this.  They're putting on white gloves.  Brings you back to an innocent time, right? 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  No, not innocent.  Porter, Porter, grab my luggage.  A time when nothing was spoken about.  Everything was swept under the carpet.  Yes.  Not an innocent time.  The good old days.  They were popping each other's shitters.  Don't you kid yourself.  The hairy old pussies.  There's never an innocent time.  E-Roc's on the ball today.  He must have got a good night.  He's laying on his stomach here.  I'm sorry, E-Roc.  Oh, my God.  That YouTube video sucks, man. 
[00:51:30]  The one that's shown on TV, you just see shit flying all over the place inside the airport.  The song?  No.  The video for Meet Me in St. Louis while we watch tornado footage.  Rip apart the airport.  Yeah, it's got a bunch of videos from Snoop's girl shaking their asses and then the tornado  ripping the fucking airport roof off.  And the big arches.  Right out of steam.  OTRs and our drivers just stay out a couple of weeks at a time.  Oh.  Thank you, Swickster on Twitter.  Thanks.  I could have figured that out. 
[00:52:00]  I think I did, actually.  There's some footage.  Tornator.  It's already here.  Where's the tornado?  Is that the tornado?  I learned that delayed flights at all.  Probably, right?  We have to get Dorothy out onto the runway.  Shut up, Dorothy.  Please.  Why don't you just sprinkle the things on the road?  I'm going to pick it up.  Why did a tornado tear through a church on Easter Sunday?  Because God hates people. 
[00:52:30]  Grateful survivors.  They go to church to worship the guy and the guy hits him with a tornado.  I know.  What is that about?  But they'll say it was a miracle no one was hurt.  But it wasn't.  But it wasn't.  It would have been a miracle if the tornado just fucking slowed down and tiptoed over the  church.  Right.  But if it tore through the church like it was an outhouse, that's not a miracle.  Idiots.  I don't know about this God thing.  I'm very confused.  But wouldn't you have a tornado hit like a casino or something on Easter Sunday and not  a church?  Tornado.  Right?  Because wouldn't the sinners and all the people that don't believe in the God thing be somewhere 
[00:53:00]  else and maybe hit those people with a tornado?  Hit the sinners.  Not the fucking people that are actually you got.  Right.  You need more people to spread the word of Jesus.  Jesus.  So why would you hit the fucking church with a tornado on Easter Sunday?  That video stunk.  There was three pieces of paper that fell.  Nah, this is a better video.  They're showing it on the news.  You'll see for yourself.  Want a break?  Yeah.  Why not?  We got Anderson Silva coming in at 745. 
[00:53:30]  He does speak English, but not particularly well.  But he sounds very quiet.  He doesn't do anything.  He'll fucking kill you, though.  And you saw his documentary.  Did you see the photos I took with him?  It was just me.  I'm an ugly fucking guy.  Oh, stop.  Well, not really.  Dude, I'm a horribly...  I'll show him to you.  And I'm going to have him sign...  Because no one can get...  People got pictures with him, but it was tough.  Yeah.  But of course, I fucking...  Oh, let me see.  Let me see if you're ugly. 
[00:54:00]  Good picture.  I got two holding it out.  One, because I was by myself.  Yeah.  My friend.  That's a good picture.  That one is not that bad.  It's a little blurry.  Yeah, you're ugly.  Oh, God.  Look at this one.  It looks like he's holding a retard puppet.  He looks like he's holding a fucking retard puppet.  But are you taking your own picture there?  Yes, but that's the problem.  You pulled your neck back.  You never pulled your neck back to pictures.  I know, but I had to lean in next to you.  You know when you're at a table and the person right next to you is like,  Ah, dude, look at the photo. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're the one leaning back with your neck sticking to your head.  Look at how handsome he is, though.  He's like a fucking model.  He's giving yourself a fourth chin.  So I'm going to ask him to sign whichever one he finds me less repulsive in.  Let him decide.  Yeah, could you decide which one I'm not ugly in and then sign it?  All right, so we got Silva coming in.  We got Jack Osborne coming in at 830 and Dimitri Martin.  We've never had Dimitri on.  Yeah, Dimitri is huge in the business.  He has a book out, I think.  You know, business. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I think what the book is called.  I think this is my book.  This is a book.  This is a book by Dimitri Martin.  He's a funny dude, man.  I don't know if this is worth it for the show, because you never know what the listeners are.  Probably not.  Nathan Brimmer on Twitter.  Funniest quote from St. Louis Tornado News.  It was like being in a horror movie.  Grown men were crying.  It was horrible.  Oh.  I wouldn't want to be.  Sounds terrible.  I wouldn't want to be close to a fuck.  Look at it.  There's the footage on CNN of what's left of part of that airport.  So wait.  So the fucking, there's no flights going out of there?  They're probably going to have one. 
[00:55:30]  You know how fucking delays are going to be out of there?  No, I think they're closing down the airport for like two months.  It says airport operating at 70% capacity.  What the fudge?  That's not closing it down.  I heard they were closing the fucking thing down.  Those are just houses you're looking at.  Oh, the whole thing's a mess, guys.  Let's just go to break and recoup.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  The virus.  What's up?  What?  What's up? 
[00:56:00]  Got some stuff here, Ant.  Some stuff.  Our pal Johnny Fairplay mentioned us on Dr. Phil.  On Dr. Phil?  Yeah.  Jesus.  What was that about?  He's obsessed with our show and it causes fights with his wife.  That's nice.  But we've had his wife in and she's really cool.  She's cool as hell.  She's been to the virus shows.  Does he like our show or hate it?  He fucking can't get enough of it.  Does he listen to it?  I don't know if he was doing this to get more Twitter followers. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, who knows?  I don't know if Johnny Fairplay.  You can't figure that guy out.  But here's the mention on Dr. Phil.  Now, Johnny Fairplay from Survivor married America's Next Top Model contestant, Michelle  Duton.  Their arguments are tearing them apart.  Hello?  Hey.  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  You get in the car, we automatically change.  That's the only time I have to listen to you.  Even if I say something like, hey, I was listening to you.  All I'd like to listen to is Opie and Anthony.  I don't understand why that's a huge, huge deal. 
[00:57:00]  It's all about you.  He doesn't like, his wife doesn't like him changing the stage in us.  Yeah.  So maybe Johnny Fairplay, when he wakes up, you know, could give us more info on that.  That's pretty cool.  I don't see that as being a really helpful call.  So what happened?  Well, I listened to it and she got mad and we said that.  All right, I just did it.  I don't see it being that big a deal as an argument either.  Those two get along, it seems, very well. 
[00:57:30]  Famously.  I think they're in cahoots.  Oh, there's that word again.  I think they're in cahoots.  They like to fuck around to get some attention out there.  I switched the station to Opie and Anthony and she switches it back and I punch her in  the face as hard as I can.  Now that's a problem.  Mm-hmm.  Just changing the station.  Not that big a deal.  Jordan is taking care of you today there, Jimmy.  I just looked it up and apparently the anniversary of Rod Carew's 11th hit is coming up this  very weak. 
[00:58:00]  It figures, right?  What's the date?  April 29th.  Wow.  That's what he's saying?  If he fucking says that April 29th, that hack fucking, that bullshit answer.  Do you know how many times I've heard the fucking April 29th anniversary of the 11th hit  argument?  It's fucking ridiculous.  Yes, it's a misnomer.  It's pretty weird you would say that, though, and it's this week.  No, but the myth of it is this week.  April 29th, 1967.  Yeah, 1967, right.  Yeah, of course.  Mr. Carew got his 11th hit. 
[00:58:30]  And 12th hit.  Yeah, no, no, 12th hit bullshit.  They were separated by a four-week period.  Everybody knows that.  He got a hit and it was four weeks and then he got his 12th hit.  Well, it's the 44th anniversary on Friday of Rod Carew's 11th hit.  You asked for this, Jimmy.  Wow.  You did ask for this.  That is a big...  Do you need any more Rod Carew info today?  Big moment to celebrate.  It's almost Rod Carew day.  Almost.  What size are his shoes?  What size?  Let's see if the guy knows.  All right, we'll find out in a little while. 
[00:59:00]  They just know everything, the listeners, don't they?  They really do.  They try to use the phone when they call in.  You could look up anything.  It's amazing.  Brian in D.C.  What's up, Brian?  Hey.  Hey, why are we talking about hockey?  Why were we talking about hockey earlier?  Do we not understand we got the NBA playoffs, four games a day, killing games, man?  I mean, why are we talking about hockey?  When they went on strike, nobody noticed.  I know I didn't. 
[00:59:30]  Look, I'm a much bigger hockey fan than basketball.  The hockey playoffs, much more exciting than basketball playoffs.  And also, early rounds of the playoffs, not many surprises.  Oh, wow.  Where's Ira when we need him?  Not many surprises.  Surprises.  But with hockey, man, it could go either way almost any night.  The playoffs, the NBA playoffs get much better when it's down, I don't know, like, let's  call it four teams.  Okay. 
[01:00:00]  And then it gets exciting.  But you really think the Sixers are going to beat the fucking Heat?  Not at all.  All right.  Then why am I watching that when I got playoff hockey on the other channel?  All right.  Case in point, I'll give you that one.  But let me ask you this thing.  Why are we ripping on the black guy?  In all honesty, it sounds to me like you got a potential Kobe Bryant on your hands, and  you got people ripping on him because he's black.  Is that how we roll around here?  That's how they roll in Boston.  Brian, the only reason we brought it up, trust me, I would have loved to just made fun 
[01:00:30]  of him because he's black.  Of course.  But the fact is, we brought it up because during this game the other day, every time  he touched the puck, Boston is booing.  And Boston is legendary for being possibly a bit on the racist side.  Right.  So it made for a fun little story that we had to investigate.  Did you listen to...  No, this guy's right, though.  Go ahead, dude.  Just tell it like it is.  I got what you're saying.  I appreciate you airing that out for me.  I'm done.  What team do you want?  Because you're in D.C.  Huh?  No, I'm on the road right now, man. 
[01:01:00]  And I'm actually going to New Jersey.  So I'm listening to all you...  I don't give a fuck where you're going.  I want to know what team you got in the playoffs.  Huh?  I got out of the heat, man.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Boy, that's a big fucking stretch.  Not on a limb.  Boy, wow.  You picked the fucking team with the super team.  You're absolutely right.  Most of the NBA is rooting against the Heat.  You know that.  No way.  I will laugh so fucking hard when LeBron James walks away with no championship.  I think he's going to get a championship, I promise. 
[01:01:30]  And then breaks his knee in the offseason.  Then he doesn't even have a chance for the next three or four years.  That's right.  That's what I'm going to laugh at.  And this itchy asshole.  LeBron James.  That's right.  All right.  Well, appreciate it.  Let's see him get past Oklahoma.  Just say I appreciate.  Take a peek at that Oklahoma team.  They're making it look very easy in the playoffs.  There's your fucking playoff talk.  Now, beat it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't even know if that was accurate when I said Oklahoma. 
[01:02:00]  I have no idea.  Are they doing well?  I have no idea.  I have no clue.  Couldn't even tell you.  All right.  So we got the Johnny Fair play.  So hopefully he'll call in to explain that further.  Oh.  Do you want Nick Cannon's latest 92 fucking three now stunt?  Is it The Fugitive?  This one makes The Fugitive look like fucking dick soup.  Really?  Dick soup.  Hey, I'm starving.  We got any dick soup back there?  All out.  Oh, damn.  I think they serve that in the Chinese restaurants, right? 
[01:02:30]  With that fucking weird fucking egg white soup shit.  I hate that.  What the hell is that?  Egg drop soup.  Yuck.  You got to think if there's an angry gentleman in the back,  there's a little more than fucking egg white in that soup.  So much they could do to that to fuck you up.  How would you ever know?  Nose.  Cock.  How would you ever know?  Yes.  Fucking.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Well, Nick Cannon.  This is just amazing radio.  Yeah.  This is fucking amazing.  Nick Cannon, who, of course, is over there at the former K-Rock 92.3. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Station's starting to do well, I guess, over there.  Well, they play that music that people like.  Yeah.  Seems.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And he's doing a stunt, I guess?  Yeah.  Because last I remember, it was The Fugitive, which was just huge.  Well, his wife there, Mariah Carey.  Mariah Carey just happens to be his wife, right?  I think they're married out of convenience, and then really to throw everyone off. 
[01:03:30]  Now she's pregnant with kids.  Oh, are you talking beard, maybe?  I don't know what the fuck's going on there, but it's a weird relationship.  Very strange.  Yeah.  Nick announces he's going on paternity leave.  What?  But we'll miss his audience.  Oh, really?  Did I go on paternity leave, Matt?  I think you went up for a little while, sure.  Not that long.  Not that long.  A little while?  A couple days.  You gotta, you know.  I don't even think I did a week.  You gotta settle in.  Yeah.  Well, he's going on paternity leave, because any day, you know... 
[01:04:00]  Mariah's dropping that kid.  Yeah, her pussy's gonna open up, and some kid's gonna pop out.  More than one, right?  She's got the twins, I think?  Wow.  That's some damage.  And when someone has twins, you gotta be suspicious that it was a little artificial action.  In vitro fertilization?  Did they have sex for these kids?  What do you think?  Well, this is Nick Cannon on this show.  New York's new 92.3 now.  Rolling with Nick Cannon.  Rolling! 
[01:04:30]  Jimmy, why don't we do that?  Can we start that?  I'd love to.  Rolling with Opie and Anthony, and then you just go...  Rolling!  This is how we get it in every morning, and this morning was interesting.  I sped up in here, made it into the show by the hair of my teeth.  Five seconds left before we had to go on.  I was freaking out.  Were you freaking out?  How come he's got hairy teeth? 
[01:05:00]  What, is he eating hairs and wigs?  Probably Mariah's pussy.  You can go back and play it.  Mariah's pussy's real hairy, obviously.  Oh, oh.  Got a few stuck there.  She's not shaving.  Need a little floss.  These days.  She was freaking out!  Yeah.  We had to go on.  I was freaking out.  Because I was with my wife at the hospital, and everything's wonderful.  Everything's great.  There was rumors out there yesterday that she was in labor. 
[01:05:30]  That is not yet happening, but the doctor said, any day now, it can really, really happen.  So, I'm quite excited, but I'm a little sad because I have to take paternity leave, and I'm not going to be here with you.  We're going to miss you.  Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I didn't take paternity leave, by the way.  You didn't?  That's for brunts.  Well, paternity leave. 
[01:06:00]  It's maternity leave.  I get it.  Maternity is, you know, for a mother.  A guy just takes a few days off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't put a name on it.  You'll look like a...  Yeah.  You know, a sissy boy.  Yeah.  A lot to say sissy boy.  You can say sissy boy.  Definitely.  Don't ever tell your boss you need paternity leave.  Oh, my God.  Just say, you know what?  My wife's having a kid.  I'm going to take some vacation next week.  I'm taking a little time.  Paternity leave sounds awful.  Well, you know what?  I think it balances things out and makes people feel, you know, more like you're one. 
[01:06:30]  There's not this division between man and woman anymore.  I think it's an insult to women when you're a guy and you say, I'm taking paternity leave.  Because a woman takes maternity leave because her twat just...  Oh, crazy.  ...turned into this fucking flower thing.  About ten times the size to push out a baby.  So, guess what?  The woman needs actual time to let her body heal.  And what do you do?  I don't even want to see that. 
[01:07:00]  What, do you breathe?  You help her with her breathing and you need paternity leave for that?  Get the fuck out of here.  The women deserve their maternity leave and we just, you know, we're taking a few days...  Go to work.  ...to help our wife out.  Bring home the bacon.  Why make it about yourself?  I need to take paternity leave.  I feel bloated because my wife's having a kid.  So, he's really doing this?  Yeah.  Nick goes crazy and decides to, well, let me let this play out and this is where the crazy  bit starts.  No, I'm for real.  I don't know if I could take two weeks without communicating with my 92.3 now people. 
[01:07:30]  I just have to figure something out.  You know what?  I probably, this is, people are probably going to think I'm crazy and ridiculous and insane  for doing...  What do you think he's going to do?  Oh, boy.  What do you think he's going to do?  Live broadcast from her pussy.  Right inside of it.  On this.  But something tells me, it's just going to show you how real I am. 
[01:08:00]  I'm going to give you my home phone number.  No, you're not.  Right?  I'm not.  I'm not joking.  No BS.  No, he slipped.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not joking.  I'm not joking.  Who wants to tear down this wall?  So he's going to give out his phone number.  A phone number that I'm sure the station sets up and then he gets everyone thinking that  they're actually calling the cannon's home number.  Of course.  Or maybe they even actually give them a cell phone and say, okay, here's your fake home  number.  So maybe every once in a while you can talk to your listeners and at the very least, a 
[01:08:30]  lot of people will leave messages and then we'll certainly play those messages while you're  gone.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We sold it too.  Sales is all over.  I'm not joking.  No BS right now.  Did you lose your mind today?  Evidently.  I'm going to give out my home phone number.  And anyone in the tri-state can call me at any time. 
[01:09:00]  Whatever's on your mind.  I might be, you know, on diaper duty, might be massaging my wife's feet, but I would give  you the number to our residence.  We don't even have your home phone number, Nick.  You're not going to.  I'm trying to prove a point here, so sincerely.  I'm trying to prove how much I love my people.  I'm trying to prove that I would do anything for you.  I would give out my home phone number.  Yeah.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  It might be a bitch. 
[01:09:30]  Huh?  It could be.  Well, I see we have Anderson Silva outside of the studio, so just set this up.  Yeah, we will.  Hold on.  We'll get back to the Nick Cannon thing, giving out his home phone number as his wife has their  children.  Because it gets even better.  Oh, I don't doubt.  It's a genius.  Yeah.  All the way around.  Let's bring him in.  Anderson Silva.  Anderson.  He's promoting his Like Water movie.  Tell us.  Yeah, what's this about?  That's part of the Tribeca Film Festival.  It is, right?  It's about his... 
[01:10:00]  Roland.  Chop, chop.  Chop.  Chop.  Roland, bring him right in.  Let's go, man.  We're ready.  Hey, how are you?  Yeah.  Oh.  Somebody know somebody out there?  What's that?  I heard a how are you.  Yeah.  It's very radio.  Everybody's greeting.  Damn.  Here we go.  Come on in, sir.  Oh, my God.  Pulling something out of his pocket.  Oh.  He's actually a better radio guy than we are.  I know, right?  Ah, the phones and everything.  Look at this.  See, he knows.  Anderson Silva.  What's up, Roland?  Morning.  Morning.  Morning, man. 
[01:10:30]  How you doing?  Morning.  Oh, I can remember the Forrest Griffin.  Yeah.  It was very unpleasant.  Unpleasant.  Damn, that's great, man.  Where's the camera?  Sam doesn't have tape.  Sam doesn't have tape.  Tape?  What gear is this that they use cameras with tapes anymore?  I don't know.  So he doesn't have tape for Jack either?  He's getting it.  Hello, Anderson.  How are you?  How are you, Anderson?  I'm good.  I'm good.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Is this early for you?  Yes.  How much press do you have today?  You have a lot of stuff to do?  He's nodding, yes.  They can't hear you.  I saw the documentary, and it was really good.  It was really, really well done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the...  This is my real story.  This is me.  This is real Anderson.  It's good.  You're a very private guy, it seems like. 
[01:11:30]  People don't know a lot about you.  People know a lot in the ring.  But your private life and what you're like at home, it seems like nobody has any idea what you're like as a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes, my fans or the people that look at the show, the UFC show, know what to stand for the guys inside the ring.  But this is the great opportunity.  It's for me, for all the fighters. 
[01:12:00]  This is great.  So what do we see in the documentary?  Is it just about the fighting aspect, or is it just about your whole life?  My whole life.  Oh, so it's your whole life, your upbringing and how that was.  What was that like growing up?  Brazil, right?  Yes.  Yeah, what was that like as a kid growing up?  How did you grow up in Brazil?  For me, I love Brazil. 
[01:12:30]  I love...  There's Jimmy.  Yeah, I've been there.  Yeah, I love my story.  I'm...  I'm going for Curitiba for a long time.  My uncle is my stepfather.  I'm going for Curitiba.  That's an interesting storyline right there. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, the uncle is the stepfather?  It's the same person?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going for Curitiba.  I've got four years.  Yes, he was born in Sao Paulo, and he moved to Curitiba.  It's a smaller city in the south of Brazil when he was four years old, and he lived with  his uncle and his aunt.  Oh, Sao Paulo.  I've been to Rio a few times, but I never went to some...  But not for good...  You know, I did bad things when I was there. 
[01:13:30]  Rio's party town, right?  Yeah, that's kind of like...  Yeah, I didn't go for...  I know, por favor, reals, that's all I learned.  It's the only two words you really, you know, you need in that area.  Is it that...  What kind of pressure is it being...  Everyone considers you, pound for pound, probably the best fighter in the world.  And how much pressure does that add every time you step in the ring?  Everybody is gunning for you.  Yeah, I don't... 
[01:14:00]  For me, it's no pressure.  I'm...  I'm staying all the time, the focus for my working.  Sometimes, the guys don't understand this.  It's very important, all the time, the focus for this working.  The fight is different than all the supporters.  It's very important, focus.  So, what made you want to open up your life, because you're private, and let people film 
[01:14:30]  it, and film you...  It's just like...  It's great...  In the documentary, it's really good, because they show these really explosive fights in  the ring, and people getting knocked out, and then it's a quick cut, and it shows you  with your family, and your wife, and your kids, and it's very quiet, and it's very suburban.  What made you want to open up and show people that?  What made you want to open up and show people that you want to open up to your private side?  This is the great idea that my team together, Pablo and Jerry, this is the great opportunity 
[01:15:00]  for me, for my team, and for my family.  It's the big desafio for all the team.  Sometimes I talk to my team for my manager, for all the guys in my team, and it's, hey, I don't 
[01:15:30]  know if this is a good idea.  Yeah, this is the, my, my wife, my life.  Right.  But, go for the, the, the look, the film, I'm looking, oh, I like it.  My friends like the movie, hey, this is you. 
[01:16:00]  So, you didn't feel, you didn't feel exposed or invaded, uh, having cameras in your house  and looking at your private life.  Sometimes I'm, I don't like it, but it's okay.  Was there anything you didn't want them to show, that you said, look, you can film this,  but you can't show this, or, or they, they could show whatever they wanted?  No, that's really what they want.  Steven Seagal, too.  Okay, sorry.  No, I'm just sticking with the family thing.  He's got, uh, three sons and two daughters, I believe. 
[01:16:30]  Five kids, right?  Yes.  How do you find time to even train?  Yeah.  All the time, I, I, I don't have time for, uh, too much time for staying in my house.  Right.  In Curitiba.  All the time, I'm staying, the training, training, training, I'm, I'm, I mean.  How old are the kids?  Uh, 12, 11, 7, and 6.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That's busy time for you, man.  Now, do you think they're going to want to fight? 
[01:17:00]  No.  No?  No.  You don't want them fighting?  No.  Why don't you want them fighting?  It's done well for you.  Um, my sense, uh, uh, I like to play soccer.  Sometimes, the, the boys training, but I know, no, no pressing the guys for this.  Uh, I love to play soccer.  But it might, it might be, it might be in his DNA to have that, you know, have that kick  you have. 
[01:17:30]  He might have the same kick you have there, sir.  Yes.  Yes.  The kick you did.  Uh, I guess the kick would work for, uh, for soccer, but I'm thinking, you know, a couple  of kicks to the head and this guy.  Crossed the entire field.  Yeah.  Soccer's a little, little easier though, because the ball doesn't kick back.  Um, you, uh, the kick you knocked Belfort out was, was a really ugly kick to the face.  Like, it was a straight kick to the face.  And was that something that Seagal taught you?  Because he really did train you, right?  Yeah, sometimes, uh, uh, I'm training for, for a long time. 
[01:18:00]  This, uh, this, uh, this, this movement, but this, Steven Seagal, staying together, the  training is the, the little movement for my, my, my kick, but no, show me the movement,  the, the, the kick, but the little more technique.  He helped, he helped you improve it a little bit.  Yes.  And you seem to, you knocked Belfort out so completely knocked him out. 
[01:18:30]  And then you kind of sat on the, uh, mat with him and kind of held him for a little while.  You guys have a, a history, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, the Vitor is, for a long time, training together my team.  Um, it's for team Noguera.  But, I don't know, uh, one day, guys training together, the whole day, I'm going for the 
[01:19:00]  UFC, for fight, for the belt, the midway champion.  The guys in my team, my brothers in team, what happened, Vitor?  You stay together.  This is the, the big family.  What happened?  No, I'm going for the fight, and that's it.  So, when he wanted to fight you for the belt, you kind of felt like somebody close to you.  Did it feel like a betrayal at all?  Like a guy who you had kind of taken care of was now coming up against you?  It was like a betrayal. 
[01:19:30]  He was training with you, he wanted your title.  Yeah.  Not for me, no, but, yes, for me, for my old team.  Did you feel bad after you knocked him out?  Because you really, it was really a knockout.  Like, it wasn't like one of those, you know, ambiguous things where like, oh, he might get  up.  It was like, he really, that was the way I would have gotten knocked out if I'd gotten  kicked by that.  There was no doubt.  Did you feel like you were worried you might have hurt him?  Because you, you seemed to really like, uh, care for him while, when he was laying on  the mat.  Uh, no, this is the, the, the, my work, the working, the old fighters, that's okay. 
[01:20:00]  Finish is finish.  No, no have problem for Vitor, for all the fights.  Do you like to, uh, because the reputation is that, do you, do you like to taunt your opponents  sometimes?  The Damian Maia fight was, you know, that was a big controversy in UFC because, um, it looked  like you could have put him away early.  You, he was not in your league as far as, uh, ability.  He's a good fighter, but not you. 
[01:20:30]  And, and, uh, Anderson kind of taunted him for five rounds.  And was there a point where you just wanted to humiliate him or what was the strategy behind  that?  What was the strategy behind that?  Uh, is this, I, I talked to my, my coach for my, my training partners for the, all the  time, the, um, confusion, the, the Damian Maia, but, uh, for the second round, I'm little, 
[01:21:00]  the, no, no, no control the fight, but I'm, that's okay.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm win.  I don't know the, for the, the, the fight, I'm, I talked to the, the, the second round,  I talked to my coach, hey, uh, what, what is the, the, the, the strategy now?  My coach talked to me, hey, it's cool, it's you. 
[01:21:30]  So you didn't feel like you, no, no, what did Dana say to you in the locker room?  Was he, was he, was he kind?  Or was he upset?  What did Dana say to you later?  Uh, Anderson, sometimes I hate you.  Sometimes I love you.  He said that to you?  Sometimes I hate you.  Sometimes I love you.  That's okay, boy.  That's okay, boss.  Yeah, boss.  Yeah, big difference.  Were you, were you, uh, were you nervous about getting cut out of the UFC? 
[01:22:00]  Because Eddie, uh, his name is, the trainer is Eddie?  Ed.  And were you worried about, because he seemed like he was very concerned that Dana might  cut you out?  No, no.  Uh, I have, uh, I'm staying in the fight for a long time.  I have the big, big story in MMA.  Uh, sometimes Dana is too much. 
[01:22:30]  It's severe.  But, that's okay.  He reacts too harshly sometimes?  Yes.  I think so too.  Yeah.  Of course you're going to say that.  I love Dana.  I love Dana.  I love him too.  No, I love Dana.  It's, it's, it's, I, I want to stay in.  It's, it's the, the, the business.  Sometimes people like the guy for the knockout, all the, all the fighters.  But, sometimes, don't have time, don't have chance. 
[01:23:00]  That's okay.  And the documentary too is about, it's, uh, Chael, uh, Sonnen fight.  Uh, I hope I'm saying his name right.  Which was, uh, uh, not the last fight, but the fight I think before, two fights ago.  And it, it's kind of a lead up to that fight.  So you see Anderson training, and you see his team training, and you see a lot of his personal  and private life.  And for fight fans, it's an amazing documentary.  He talked, Chael, so much shit before the fight.  He really did talk a lot of shit on some level that had to make you want to really smash him. 
[01:23:30]  Did it get to you at all, his, his talking?  Tudo que ele falou não te atingiu?  Uh, no.  I'm, I'm all, all the time, the, the, I'm concentration in, in my fight for Chael.  Uh, Chael.  It's a good fight, but, I don't know, it was too much crazy.  Were you, were you surprised at how good he was? 
[01:24:00]  Because he was very tough, and he went five full rounds, um, and you want, you submitted  them in the fifth round, but did it feel like this guy, because usually people that talk a  lot are not as good as they are, say they're going to be, but he fought you tough for five  rounds, and it looked like he was actually, were you surprised by how tough he was?  No.  Uh, I, the Chael have the, the chance for four rounds, but, uh, my opinion, the Chael is  good, it's good, it's good fighter, but no win. 
[01:24:30]  The Chael hit me, and, one, two, three, four, five rounds.  And he couldn't knock you out.  And no, finish the fight.  Hmm.  I don't know what happened.  Were you off that day?  I mean, when you go into a fight, sometimes do you feel like you're not fighting up to what  you should be?  Do you feel like you're just, some days you're tired, or some days you're not feeling well?  Well, I mean, are you ever off when you're fighting?  Acontece isso, você não tá, 100%, você não tá se sentindo tão bem numa luta?  Uh, sometimes this, uh, yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Uh, this fight in the, the Chael Sonny, the, my hips is, uh, the little, it was fractured.  One of his ribs was fractured.  Yeah.  Damn.  Cause, all right, then, cause during the documentary, there's a few times where he's training,  and he keeps reaching to his right side, and he keeps having to sit and stop training,  and I figured it was, I thought it was, for me, that, that happens a lot, but just because  I get very tired when I exercise, cause I'm lazy, I'm out of shape.  He continued training with a, with a fractured hip? 
[01:25:30]  A rib.  A rib?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So that hurt, that hurt you in the fight?  Yeah, to talk to the doctor, I, I go for the doctor, me and, and my,  my manager, Ed Suarez, the doctor talked to me, and Ed, hey, it's very, very important.  Anderson, no go the fight.  It's danger.  It's no go.  So he, he wanted you to can the fight, and you didn't do it?  Yeah, I'm, I talked to Ed, okay, okay. 
[01:26:00]  I talked to the doctor, I'm no go fight.  Doesn't he, he has the longest winning streak in the UFC right now, right?  Yes, he does.  At 13, I think?  And also title defenses.  Of course, yeah.  How many title defenses?  Uh, it's eight right now.  When, when are you going to fight, uh, Mr. Pierre there?  I don't know, maybe, uh, the, then that.  It's got to happen, right?  Yeah.  You want it to happen, right?  Yeah.  The, the, George St. Pierre is good, good fighter.  He's an animal. 
[01:26:30]  He's got to have the big techniques.  Yeah.  What's the weight difference, though?  I, I'm, I'm sure that if anybody doesn't want it to happen, it's probably St. Pierre.  Um, you, you, you're a lot heavier than St. Pierre, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much weight difference is there between?  Mmm, maybe.  Well, St. Pierre fights a 170, he fights a 185.  Okay, so, would he go up or would you go down?  He would go up, probably?  Maybe, uh.  Maybe meet in the middle.  Meet in the middle?  Middle, yes.  When you fought Forrest Griffin, that was, uh, isn't he, uh, he's, doesn't he fight  usually a 205? 
[01:27:00]  Am I crazy?  Yes.  So he, did he come down to fight you or you went up to fight him?  No.  Stay in my, my, my category.  But the fight, the, the, the, George St. Pierre, maybe down a little bit.  George up.  I don't know.  Is he, is George, uh, scared of you?  Uh, no.  You're smiling, though.  I don't think St. Pierre would stand there and actually fight or kick or, he would probably  try to go to the ground. 
[01:27:30]  Of course he would.  And he'd probably, you know.  Do you think he would want to trade with you?  Um, I don't know.  Maybe put him in my, the ground.  George has the, the, the, the best Jiu-Jitsu, the best wrestling.  I don't know.  I think he's a little frustrated because he's not fighting, uh, George yet, right?  Do you think he's a little frustrated because he's not fighting, uh, George yet, right?  No.  Okami have the, the...  It's going to happen, though?  When, when do you think it's going to happen?  Yeah, I, I have for the fight in Brazil for, uh, to, uh, uh, for Okami. 
[01:28:00]  Uh, this is the great opportunity for me and the Okami.  This time, the, the, the, the Japão has the, the big problem.  This is the, the, the great opportunity for Japão for, uh, uh, Okami.  Well, you beat, let me just tell people, the last, the last, he fought, uh, Okami was  the last loss Anderson took.  It was, I think, in 2006 and it was on a technicality. 
[01:28:30]  It was on a, he was down and you kicked him when he was, uh, he was on the ground or he  was, he was, what exactly happened if you could explain?  Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm go for the fight for my, my, my first fight in the United States.  The, the, the, I'm go in, in, uh, for press conference for, the guys no, no talk to me  the, the, the, the, the rule difference.  The rule difference.  I'm standing on the ground, the guy move your hand, I, I kick the hand, the guy, but the 
[01:29:00]  guys no, no talk to me, nothing.  So the rule difference was where you were fighting, you were allowed to kick while they  were down and then you came here and you were not allowed to and nobody told you the rule  difference.  Right.  So that's fighting in Japan where you could kill a down opponent.  Right.  And he came here and you can't do that.  So it was a DQ.  And that was the last time he lost?  He had disqualification, but he had beaten the other guy.  Oh, so you're going to kick the shit out of him in Rio.  That's obvious.  You're going to get a little revenge on that whole situation.  That's all in Galsa.  No.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  We do.  I want to, I should, should I have him, uh, if he would?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We do it.  Explain slowly.  You've got to listen closely.  Yeah, I want the interpreter to help with this because I don't want Anderson misinterpreting  this at all and killing me.  We do this thing where I, we have a lot of fighters in.  We've had, uh, we've had, you know, Brock in Fedor, um, uh, Velasquez, all these guys  have come in and I always get them to put me in some sort of a move.  Um, I don't fight.  I mean, you look at me, you probably think I train, but I really don't.  This is just very natural.  And I try to get the guys to, cause I want to see what it feels like, but not hard. 
[01:30:00]  Just really, just to, enough to make it hurt a little bit.  I tap.  No, you know, no permanent injuries.  I tap very quickly, but, uh, I wanted to know if you would put me in something, cause  I had, I've had a lot of guys do it, um, and what, what move would you put me in, right?  I want to see what it feels like.  I've had the, uh, rear naked choke.  I've had the guillotine choke.  I've had the, uh, heel hook.  Brock put me in two leg moves and Fedor did something on my arm, which really hurt a lot.  Fedor enjoyed it.  He's kind of a sadist.  Um, and, uh, what, what would you, what would you want to put me in that's, uh, a move that 
[01:30:30]  you like to do?  He said he'd invite you for some juice.  He'd invite me for some juice?  I would, I would have some juice.  That would, it was probably a horrible move that pops your head off.  Would he, uh, what's, what's something he would put me in that's not too, just a quick,  cause I, I'm amazed watching you guys fight that I can't do it. 
[01:31:00]  And I can't, we never, fight fans don't know what that stuff feels like.  Can we just see somebody get twisted and they tap?  So to actually feel it is kind of, uh, it's fun.  I like to.  A kick?  A kick?  Eh, no, I don't think a kick.  I showed you the, the, the technique, the clinch.  The clinch?  The Muay Thai clinch.  The Muay Thai clinch.  What is that?  Uh, this is the, the, the, my first fight for the, the, the Rich Franklin.  I'm training for, for, for a long time. 
[01:31:30]  The, the start, the, the, the, my, my training camp for the, the, the fight for the, the belt.  The clinch, the Muay Thai clinch is the best.  It's the best?  All right, yes.  Okay, now, we, uh, please keep in mind, you like me.  I'm a very nice guy.  And I'm going to tap very quickly.  By the way, we met at the premiere.  And, uh, I just wanted to show you that we had, we were very happy together. 
[01:32:00]  I took two photos with, uh, Anderson.  And I just wanted to remind you.  Look at that.  Happy.  I want to show you how you were happy with him, so you don't hurt him.  How ugly am I?  Okay, okay.  All right?  Okay, good.  Let's go.  So this is the Muay Thai clinch?  Yeah, the Muay Thai clinch.  Now, I know what this is, but a lot of the people don't.  All right.  Here goes, uh, Anderson Silva.  Okay.  And the Muay Thai clinch on little Jimmy Norton.  Now, let me, let me explain it to people as we, as we do it.  Okay.  Okay, so what are you going to do? 
[01:32:30]  Uh, make it hurt.  You will stay here, the front for me.  I put my arm in here.  He's holding my head.  Yes.  On both?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm, my, my arm's in here.  I have the, all the control.  He's got my head in complete control.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I have control.  Sometimes I move your hand.  I put in the knee and.  Oh, God.  He would kick you in the stomach.  Hips and the face. 
[01:33:00]  So the Muay Thai clinch is this.  Now, how would I get out of that?  How would I get out of that?  Being knocked out?  Yeah, I know.  My stomach would probably just swallow his knee up.  My fat gut.  All right.  But for you, it's in here.  It's in here.  In here, you up your elbow.  Uh-huh.  This elbow up.  With that?  Yes.  And then what would I do?  Yeah.  Go up, up, up.  Move.  Yes.  Oh, this is kind of fun, actually. 
[01:33:30]  I actually feel like I might be able to do this.  Now, would you, uh, would you, uh, would you, uh, would you, I want to get kicked, but really  light in the arm.  I want to see what it feels like to get him.  Would you kick him into the shoulder?  Yeah, like the left arm.  Not too hard, but I want to see what it, what it feels like to get, because we didn't ask  any of the guys to do it.  I should have had somebody throw a kick, but I want to take, uh.  Would he give him a kick there, sir?  Yeah, he would.  A light one.  Not too heavy.  A light one.  Okay, okay.  All right.  You asked for it.  You sure? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's go.  Do I have to put my arms up?  All right.  Okay, here we go.  That wasn't that bad.  You could do it a little, a little, a little bit harder, but just don't, just don't knock  me down.  Make him make a noise there.  Yeah, make him make a noise.  We want him to make a noise is what this is all about.  Yeah.  Dude, I heard a little thud on your back.  There was a little bit more to that one.  All right, one more, a little harder.  I like this we're working up to.  Yeah, yeah, we're working up to.  Are you sure? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  We definitely, we want to hear a noise from Jimmy, but don't break his shoulder.  Look at that face.  Remember, you guys got along now.  There we go.  You have a doctor here?  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have a doctor here.  Yeah, okay, here we go.  Oh!  Yeah, that hurts.  That really is unpleasant.  It's not.  And that couldn't have been more than 20%, Jimmy.  Yeah, how hard was that?  No, not even.  What was that, like 10% of your strength?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:35:00]  Five.  Five percent?  Yes.  That was not.  Do you know what it would be like if he just wound up and hit you?  If that wall, you'd go through the window.  But I kind of like it.  I kind of like taking the, uh...  Yeah, well, you want to do one more or a little harder?  Uh, that was five percent?  Yes.  All right.  Go 25%.  No.  Um, no, that would break my arm.  25% would break my arm.  How about...  Eight?  10%.  I'll do 10%.  Oh, 10%.  7%.  Ha ha ha ha.  Okay.  All right, here's another kick from this silver.  By the way, if you can see his face, he's got the... 
[01:35:30]  He's like...  All right.  Okay, like he knows how bad this is going to be, and I don't.  All right, so...  He's...  He's...  You know how embarrassing he is?  He's actually positioning my arm.  He's positioning you.  I'm like a girl.  So he can kick you.  Watch the mic.  Oh.  Oh!  Oh!  Okay.  That.  He could knock me out by kicking me in the arm.  Yeah.  Sorry. 
[01:36:00]  No, no, no, no.  It's okay.  Wow.  Are you done, Jimmy?  Yeah, that was good.  That was good.  That was good.  If he kicked you in the arm full bar, you would be knocked out, right?  Yeah.  Dude, if he kicked me in the arm...  A little harder than that, I would have went down, and a slightly harder than that, he  would have knocked me out.  And you'd be like...  Wow.  You feel it.  It's weird.  Like, my head was jarred.  You really feel it, and you're, like, disoriented for a second.  And that's nothing.  Dude, that was fucking really...  And you get that to the side of the head at full, full power. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, look at my face.  That's actually the nicest photo I took.  Yeah.  You're crazy.  You're crazy.  No, I like to...  People have told him that.  I like to see what that...  Because, you know, I watched him throw kicks in the octagon, and it's like, you want to  see what that feels like.  But it just makes you respect the fighters more.  For guys to actually stand there and know this is what they're getting into.  And was that 10%?  It was whatever...  Anderson, how...  He's being very gentle.  What percent was that?  10?  No, 10. 
[01:37:00]  Maybe a little more.  That's it.  There are guys that take that to the head, and it's like, it's...  You can't not get knocked out by that, or by a punch.  That's the first kick I've taken.  My head is actually like a headache now, from that kick, because it hit my shoulder.  It just rattled your brain.  Oh, boy, would I not last long in the UFC.  No, you would not.  I want to make sure people really go and check out this movie, Like Water.  Documentary on Anderson Silva's life.  Yes.  And it's a quote from Bruce Lee.  Like Water is in a very famous Bruce Lee interview, where he says you have to be like 
[01:37:30]  water.  And it's a tremendously insightful and very, very...  It's a real look at Anderson Silva, who we don't get to see.  We just see you knocking people out, and you have an odd reputation, and he just seems  like a really nice guy and a nice family man.  You said odd reputation, the mystery of Silva's psychological games.  Like, people get frustrated by you and your psychological games, Anderson?  Some of the promoters, I hear? 
[01:38:00]  Sometimes.  What's one of the psychological games they've been frustrated with?  With one of the tactics that you use?  I try to...  All the time I'm staying there, relax.  I know, nervous, nothing.  I'm staying there, all the time, relax.  All the time, take your focus.  Sometimes I watch my opponent, the guy is nervous, no have control of the situation. 
[01:38:30]  I don't know.  Did you feel guilty that you knocked Forrest Griffin out so fast?  That was really an embarrassing knockout.  Forrest ran to the dressing room after that.  That was an embarrassing moment.  Yeah, it's the magic moment.  For you, yeah, for him, not very good.  It was a great knockout.  We were there.  You guys in Philadelphia?  We were at that one.  Wow, the place went nuts.  Well, let's give the documentary a good plug. 
[01:39:00]  It's called...  Like Water.  Like Water, and it's playing...  Where is it playing?  The Tribeca Film Festival now?  And what happens after?  Does it go to DVD?  Do people go...  Where do people see it?  They see it in Tribeca, and if they don't live in New York, where can they see it?  Where do you go to the documentary later?  I don't know.  Maybe Jerry and Pablo talked about the guys for the continue of the movie and the cinema. 
[01:39:30]  I don't know.  Okay, see, it might be in the movie.  But if you're a fight fan or UFC fan, I loved it.  I went with a friend of mine who's not a UFC fan.  And they loved it.  She did, yeah.  She's a girl, and she just thought it was really interesting to watch the...  Kind of the difference between him in the ring and him dealing with other UFC people,  and then him with his wife and his children.  She's a very nice family.  God, that fuck...  I have a headache from that kid.  Dude, that was great.  But I knew he would be a nice guy and not try to...  I knew he would try to not... 
[01:40:00]  You know, Fedor enjoyed it.  Like, I tapped with Fedor, and he just squeezed a little bit more.  A little tighter, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he was very gentle, which means that he really could fucking hurt me badly.  Yeah, it's a hell of a kick.  So thank you for being gentle with me.  You're welcome, my friend.  I enjoyed that.  All right, so let's take a break.  Anderson Silva, thank you very much, and...  Continued success.  Continued success, man.  Okay, thank you, guys.  Thank you so much.  Like water, Tribeca Film Festival, I recommend it highly.  The Virus, Sirius XM. 
[01:40:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm very excited to meet Jack Osborne for the first time.  Promoting God Bless Ozzy Osborne now at the Tribeca Film Festival.  Jimmy went to the movie last night.  Hey, Jack.  Hey, man.  See you again.  Pleasure to meet you, man.  We've talked to the entire family now, just about.  Except for you, yeah.  Except for you.  Jimmy went, of course, last night.  Yes, yes, he was and he's wearing the shirt.  And rave reviews, sir. 
[01:41:00]  Rave reviews on the movie you did about your dad there.  God Bless Ozzy Osborne.  Thank you.  What a smart idea, too.  The minute I walked in, I saw all the press had these shirts on.  I immediately thought, your mom, I don't know who's in charge of the press.  I'm like, what a smart idea.  It immediately made it a different event than anything else at Tribeca.  Because I went to something else, and literally, as soon as that was done, you don't even know who was in the room.  Yeah.  But this was just a brilliant, whoever your PR people are, are really smart.  No, the t-shirts was mom.  It was like total last minute, too.  I think last Thursday, she was like, let's get t-shirts made.  So we had to scramble to get that done. 
[01:41:30]  I'm just thinking to myself, like, why don't I think like that?  I mean, I'm not a rock star, but I'm like, that's a smart move.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how was it, too?  I saw you on the red carpet, and De Niro.  Did you know De Niro was going to be there, or did you guys not know?  I'd heard that he might be there, and then he turned up, and it was pretty awesome.  Yeah, and all the pictures, you look like he's just standing next to you laughing.  Yeah.  Well, because they all started to be like, Bobby, Bobby, and then my mom said something like,  they're talking like they know you, and he just started laughing. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, I have a feeling that Sharon had something to do with that.  Bobby, you get your ass over to this freaking room tonight.  Your mom is a powerful woman, is what I'm saying.  Oh, yeah.  We've all seen that for many years.  See, people are scared of her, too.  Like, she's always been so nice to me.  But you could see backstage, it's like everybody knows, like, you really don't want to fuck  up.  Yeah, one day you'll fuck up.  No, I won't.  That would be hysterical.  You would kill yourself if you ever got Sharon mad at you.  It would just be awful, because you'd be so disappointed in himself. 
[01:42:30]  Where did I go?  But no, it was funny watching backstage, how everybody kind of knows.  Yeah, I mean, it definitely, I think the reputation, though, is harsher than the actual  bite.  Yeah.  You know, all it needs is a couple incidents, and you know, you've got to be in a hard ass.  I mean, she's like the sweetest woman ever, though.  Are you more like your mom or your dad?  I think I'm more like my mom in some ways, but, you know, as the obvious, kind of like 
[01:43:00]  my dad and others.  And you've got a great story.  You've really changed your life around at an early age.  Thank you.  Kind of like Jimmy, as a matter of fact, because Jimmy was going down this weird path as a  17-year-old and changed his entire life, too.  Yeah, when I was 18, I got sober.  So, yeah.  How old were you when you cleaned up?  I was 17.  Oh, okay.  Oh, so you're exactly the same old.  Yeah.  I see it's a bit parallel.  And people always, like, you know, sometimes you feel like, you know, well, I was really  young.  And people are like, dude, you couldn't even have done anything by that age.  It's like, you have no idea.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:43:30]  Did you know Jack at 17?  For sure.  You know, I used to make jokes about it when I was, like, early on when I was drinking,  and the whole thing would be like, oh, you know, admitting it's half the battle, like,  let's crack one open.  But, yeah, I mean, you just kind of know.  It's like, you know, when you're pickled, you know, can't become a cucumber again.  Right.  Did your father, did watching your dad have any influence on you?  Like, you saw where things could progress to?  Kind of, I wouldn't say it was influence. 
[01:44:00]  I was always kind of aware that, like, where dad, you know, because I'd always been around  it.  You know, growing up, it was, you know, dad was constantly in out treatment, and it  would always been kind of, you know, kind of ground into me, like, you know, be careful,  be careful.  And, you know, and then, you know, you hear stories of, like, when things are always cool  in, like, the 70s when everyone's taking acid, and I was like, ah, that sounds like so much  fun.  But it's, you know, I think regardless whether I drank when I was 14, or, you know, if I'd 
[01:44:30]  waited until I was 21, I think that, you know, the end result would have always kind of been  the same.  Yeah.  Just too much.  Yep.  But it's...  It's a good feeling, though, because, you know, when you start, when you're 17 or 18,  it's like, all right, I got that horrible shit out of the way, so now I kind of feel  like I can progress and have a...  But it's almost like if you were to start when you were 21, who knows, you might have  driven into a pole and fucking...  That's what I look at.  I mean, I used to, you know, I used to drink and drive without a license when I was, like,  16. 
[01:45:00]  You know, it's like just stupid things like that.  You know, when you grow up, you're like, what was I thinking?  Right.  Good thing that was over seven years ago, so if the police...  Right, right, you don't have to worry about that anymore.  How long did you get sober?  Eight years.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I thought I didn't realize it was eight.  Damn, that's a long time.  That is a long time.  Did you ever regret doing the Osbournes?  Like, do you ever feel like it exposed too much?  I used to, but, you know, when things were really...  When there was a lot of heat on us from the Osbournes, I was like, why did I do this?  This is the worst mistake of my life.  But it opened so many doors, and it, you know, it kind of just kept me going these last 
[01:45:30]  ten years, so you can't really hate on it.  Sure.  And I want to ask about you getting sober.  Sober Extreme Celebrity Detox?  Was it a show in England that you did?  No, that was...  It was like...  I got...  I've been sober two years, and I did this, like, one-off show in England called Extreme  Celebrity Detox.  And then that kind of kicked off my...  I had my own show over there for about five years.  It was a good show, by the way.  Thank you.  The Adrenaline Show.  Yeah.  How did you get sober?  How did...  I...  Mom and Dad kind of... 
[01:46:00]  Because my mom was really sick with cancer, so kind of all focus was on her, and I just  kind of went off and did my own thing.  And then when she went into remission, she got a phone call from a friend of mine, and  she was like, you know, Jack's not in a good way.  And then, like, a couple weeks later, my mom kind of like, hey, it's time to go to treatment.  And I was like, nope.  Nope.  Took off running, and I disappeared for, like, a weekend and came back, and, you know, I was  like, all right, let's do this.  Did you get some partying done?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  In that weekend?  Yeah.  You had your one more?  Yeah.  It's fine.  No, but...  Because did you know?  You knew they were coming for you, and you're like, I'm going to get one more in.  Exactly.  I was like, you know, I at least got to have one last hurrah, and it was really strange.  I don't really remember much, but my whole thing, being 17, you know, 420, was still  kind of a big deal.  Right.  So I got sober on 421.  All right.  Oh, happy anniversary.  Yeah, thank you.  Just passed.  That's great.  Eight years.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, absolutely.  I can't believe it's been that long.  It's like, we forget that the Osborne started, what, in 2002?  I mean, that's almost 10 years ago.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:47:00]  And I remember we interviewed Kelly.  Remember in Philadelphia?  Sure.  And you seemed a little odd, because you had, like, military garb and, you know, a little  gun.  And she got really mad, because you're like, yeah, your brother seems like a little...  It wasn't anything bad, you said.  You said he was like a little, uh...  You said he seemed like a little...  A little quirky or...  Quirky or a little odd.  And she's like, that's my brother.  Like, she got really pissed off.  Oh, yeah.  She's going to rip our throats out.  Yeah, Kelly gets pretty...  She gets pretty thug life like that.  A little defensive.  Don't say anything about the family.  You know, you'll end up in the river.  That's good, man.  I think that really kind of made people like the family a lot.  It was like, all right, here's the father that we all think we know. 
[01:47:30]  And then you see how kind of clannish and together they are and supportive.  And it was like, wow, how can you not like these people?  And Jimmy likes the movie because it seems to be very honest.  Yeah.  I mean, that was the whole thing with it.  I didn't want to make your typical, like, you know, MTV, like, documentary.  Yeah, only shows some of the stuff.  Yeah, you know, with, like, the ripping guitar solas between scenes.  And then, Ozzy bit a bat's head up.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  You know, I didn't, I didn't want to make that film.  And, you know, I wanted to kind of, the whole, I guess, uh, ethos behind it 
[01:48:00]  was to kind of show Ozzy in a light now that no one was aware of.  Because he still kind of had this stigma attached to him from the Osbournes of, like,  this kind of awkward, bumbly, kind of, you know, almost buffoonish guy.  And since he got sober, it's just not the case.  No, not at all.  And I was getting kind of fed up that, like, mainstream media was still kind of, had this  stamp on him.  And it was, you know, so I was like, well, you know. 
[01:48:30]  And they'll have that stamp for years to come.  Yeah.  Even though you're showing a different angle.  That's just how they play that crap.  Yeah, I mean, it's like first impressions are the kind of last impressions, really.  Yes, yes.  It's always, you know, I mean, people still think I'm, you know, 16 running around my  parents back garden.  Jimmy's, you know, Ozzy's biggest fan.  And he saw not only footage he's never seen before, which is amazing, because Jimmy's seen  everything.  Yeah, it was great to see it.  And you learned some things about Ozzy, right?  My favorite part of it, I won't give away everything that was said, obviously, but it  was, what you don't see in the other documentaries, was really all the children. 
[01:49:00]  Like, I had seen Louis, I had never seen Ozzy's other daughter from his first marriage.  Amy, you very rarely hear her speak.  But all the kids talking about what Ozzy was like as a father.  And it wasn't glowing.  And I was thinking to him as I was watching this, like, I wonder if that was the first  time you guys had all watched it together.  Was that hard for him to hear that, you think?  He'd seen a rough copy six months ago.  So he kind of, I think he was a new, you know, the rough idea of what everyone was saying. 
[01:49:30]  So, I mean, I know it was tough for him at first, but it's nothing he hasn't heard before.  You know, nothing that, you know, when heated arguments have occurred that he hasn't heard  us say.  I think it might, you know, probably was the toughest to hear from Jessica and Louis, because,  you know, he really wasn't around that much for them.  They're much older, too, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, and they have their own families, you know.  How old are they? 
[01:50:00]  About?  I think Jessica's 38 or 39, and Louis is about 36.  There's somewhere around there.  And you know, they're also, you know, adults now, so there's no life in sobriety with him,  where they can kind of see, like, hey, this is how it is now.  I'll tell you what, though, you know, he, I mean, he, his relationship with them is really  improved.  I mean, they speak, you know, sometimes more than I, you know, more than I'll speak to him.  You know, they're always, they're always on the phone, and dad's really kind of  proactive with the grandkids and stuff, so.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, he's always going, because they live really close to us in England, so he's 
[01:50:30]  always driving over there to hang out with the grandkids and stuff, so it's good.  You've done, you've done films before this one?  Uh, no, not really.  No, okay, that's what I was going to ask you.  Now, getting into it this way, this seems like, not that it would be easy, but it's, you have  universal access to your own family like that.  Do you see this as something good to be kind of a first project, or maybe you're kind of  really spoiled now?  Um, well, yeah, definitely, you know, is that, I mean, I compare it to this, if, you 
[01:51:00]  know, if my dad was a plumber, and I was like, alright, I want to get into plumbing, and  I'm going to be a plumber's apprentice, no one at the building site would go, oh, yeah,  he's, you know, he's Lou's kid, oh, he's, you know, a fucking plumber, like, whatever,  you know, screw him.  And I think that's the really unfair thing when your parents work in entertainment.  Why is it such an insult when the kids are trying to, you know, work in essentially the  family business?  Right, right.  So, it's kind of, that's the, you know, the kind of... 
[01:51:30]  I think the more talented the parents, the more the kids have to live up to, as far as  talent goes, instead of, it's like, oh, well, he's obviously just riding the coattails  of someone that had talent, and that has been the instance in some cases with child, children  of celebrities, they have just sucked, you know?  Yeah, there is.  It's a great example, you know, Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, Eric, not so good.  It's still time.  No, not for him.  I'm so stupid, he's joking, I'm going to give him a literal answer. 
[01:52:00]  I'm a fucking asshole, I am.  What a real gym.  What a non-comic.  So, you want to make more films, is that going to be your thing, your thing?  Yeah, I mean, I enjoy the process.  It's, you know, from start to finish, I really get a kick out of it.  Where are you at in the music world?  Because I know you used to, during the Osbournes, I guess, you were producing some bands here  and there.  I think the main question is what music world?  I mean, it's kind of, you know, unless you're coming out with a 14-year-old singer from Canada,  you know, you're kind of dead in the water. 
[01:52:30]  That rock genre has just had the shit kicked out of it, huh?  Yeah.  Although, I did find this amazing band in Los Angeles, actually.  They're all 11- and 12-year-old little rock kids, and they're ripping.  Really?  Yeah.  And whatever they're doing is what's going to be huge.  Well, literally, like, I was blown away when I saw these kids play.  Wow.  Is it Dice's kids?  Yeah, that's right.  That's why I asked.  You know, Andrew Dice Clay's sons play in a band, and they're actually really good.  There was only two of them, though.  Like, you know, there was Dylan and Max. 
[01:53:00]  One was, like, drums, and one was guitar and singing.  And we're not just saying that because we like Dice a lot.  Yeah, they're actually really good.  His kids seem to have a little talent for the rock music, yeah.  I forgot the name of the band, even.  It's been a while.  L.A. Rocks.  L.A. Rocks, yeah, yeah.  How many bad fucking demos do you get handed?  It must be a lot.  Not anymore.  When we were doing the Osbournes, I literally would get hundreds a week.  And it was, you know, pretty bad.  Did you save them at first, and then you're like,  I can't throw them out at somebody's art.  And then after a month, you're like,  Oh, fuck yourself, right into the garbage.  No, I never threw anywhere. 
[01:53:30]  I've got boxes, you know, in my garage with, like, all these strange demos.  And, you know, this is my progressive folk electro band, you know, predominantly synth.  And you're like, all right, all right, this blows.  There was something I wanted to mention, too, that I noticed in the,  because it was really very moving when Ozzy was talking about his father,  you know, and his relationship, and how he wished certain things were different.  And, you know, it was really, really relatable and very moving.  But I noticed he didn't really speak about his mom at all. 
[01:54:00]  Like, there was a minimal amount, but there was no affectionate talk at all about his mom.  Yeah, I mean, his relationship with his mother was,  she kind of, I don't know, I mean, I don't kind of really want to speak out of line about,  you know, kind of, you know, that situation.  But it was, he definitely had a better relationship with his father than his mother.  And, I mean, there was, you know, we did have stuff of him talking about his mother.  But, you know, like I said, you know, we just couldn't,  there was 63 years we had to cram into 90 minutes. 
[01:54:30]  So, you know, we had to really pick and choose our battles.  And, you know, and it was, I mean, she passed away in, I think, 2000.  And, you know, there was, it was, I think there was a lot more closure with his mother passing away  than with his father.  But, yeah, he just kind of, I don't know, he doesn't really speak that much about his mother.  He wasn't that close with her.  The Randy stuff was great, too.  They do a very, they kind of, first time I ever heard Randy Rhoads talk.  Yeah.  I never fucking heard Randy Rhoads talk. 
[01:55:00]  Never heard him speak.  That is, as far as we know, one of the only, you know, tape-recorded interviews with Randy Rhoads.  He was really, there's very, very little footage.  Apparently there's some documentary supposed to be done, or someone's got, like, a lot of Randy footage.  But except for the one that you showed from, I think, Rochester, the very famous clip,  there's almost nothing on fucking Randy.  It was one sound check that somebody filmed, like, you know, and it's all in his shadows.  It's really, really hard to get stuff on him.  It really is.  It was nice to see him talk a little bit. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, yeah, it's, I mean, that whole section just chokes me up the whole time.  Yeah.  You know, because it's so, I mean, that guy was, he was a god.  And he's just so screwed up.  It says a lot about your father, too, to me, the way he showed loyalty.  There's been, Rhoads died in 82.  It's fucking 30 years ago, and they were together for three, maximum, as a partnership.  And it has never, he's never stopped talking about him.  He's never, like, refused to keep him in the forefront, which kind of tells you a lot about him as a guy. 
[01:56:00]  And being very loyal.  Yeah, I mean, you know, he dedicated his book to him.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  And when we were originally cutting the movie a long time ago, because we, you know, we kind  of had numerous cracks at it, the, you know, there wasn't that big of a Randy section.  And then Dad's book came out.  And, you know, and Dad's very kind of coy about what he would talk about and when he  would choose to talk about things.  And he would talk to me about things that he wouldn't talk to Mike, my director, about  things.  And it was very, you know, he, it wasn't like just bearing all instantly, you know. 
[01:56:30]  So, and then when the Randy book came out and he dedicated the book to it, I was like,  well, you know, I really think we should explore the Randy, you know, the Randy story a lot more.  And that's why we kind of went back in and, you know, and really beefed it up.  And you worked on this film for three and a half years.  Three and a half years.  Yeah.  Did you have your hands in it, like, a lot with editing and music?  Yeah, I mean, there's a, I find there's a really strange, with documentaries, I find  there's a really strange thing that happens when a director and a producer sits, like, 
[01:57:00]  on the editor, you know.  Because, you know, an editor's job is to edit and they're good at it.  And, you know, producer produces, director directs, you know.  And so I kind of took a step back and just let the editor do his thing.  And I'd come in and, you know, we'd help structure and, you know, and, you know,  I had no footage that the editor might not have, you know, seen yet because there was  so much.  And, you know, it was a kind of, it was a full team effort through and through.  Did you have a couple of circumstances where you were just like, hey, that was good? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  No, absolutely.  Come on.  Yeah, no, that was, like, right at the end, too.  I mean, you know, my producer, Mark, and, you know, the other director, Mike Fleiss,  we were in the edit having a huge argument a couple of weeks ago about, yeah, some footage  because we couldn't get the clearance for this one shot and because we just couldn't  find it.  Oh, shit.  And it was, and it's from Cal Jam and it's really, really crappy quality.  Like, we got it off the internet and we're like, you know, and the director's like, 
[01:58:00]  I want to keep it in.  And we're like, no way, it's so bad.  It totally makes the movie look hokey.  And so this whole thing kicked off about that.  Who won?  I think we won.  It got pulled out?  Yeah, because it just, it just looks, you know, because the Cal Jam footage is awesome.  Yeah, it's great.  And then all of a sudden it cuts to, like, grainy, like, internet footage.  Was it an interview piece or was it actually on stage?  No, it was actually, because it goes from, you know, when Bill Ward talks about they were  going on stage, you know, having taken loads of acid.  Oh, right, right, right, yeah.  And, and my dad just got, you know, it's Cal Jam, he goes with Mike and he's all like 
[01:58:30]  out of it and he goes, never seen so many people in my life.  And then it goes into the song, but I mean, the shot's great, you know, and you can tell  they're really blitzed.  Yeah, and it was funny, it was a great cut because it was like, you know, it was like  74 and everybody was kind of, you know, they were dressed in like real 70s fucking acid  looking clothes.  Yeah, it really was a nice song.  The great story about Cal Jam, though, is that Sabbath wasn't actually meant to play.  There was a big kind of ordeal about them being on the bill and like two days before  the festival, they hadn't, they hadn't even practiced any, done anything for six months. 
[01:59:00]  And, and Tony called everyone and said, hey, we got to go play this Cal Jam, it's going  to be huge.  And they literally jumped on a plane, just brought their instruments, you know, rented  whatever else they needed when they got out to LA.  Hey, we want to play.  Yeah, and they just kind of rocked up and played and there was like 700,000 people there.  Why weren't they supposed to, Sabbath and the Sabbath, it's amazing how many gigs I thought  that they should have gotten.  And it was always kind of passed over, Zeppelin was always seen, we've argued all the time.  And Zeppelin to me was always overrated compared to Sabbath. 
[01:59:30]  Well, there was, for a while, there was a huge kind of Sabbath-Zeppelin battle.  It was kind of like, you know, Stones-Beatles kind of thing for a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was, you know, they were all friends in England, but like in America, they were  kind of rivals for, you know, a short time.  But I kind of liked that, you know, they were the underdogs.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, they weren't sexy, like, you know, and I'm not to imply that I want to fuck Robert  Plant, but you understand the point.  It's like, that was what they sold with his fucking open shirt, his big dick balls, and  Sabbath was just, you know. 
[02:00:00]  Gieser said it in an interview, they're just blue-collar fucking, like, you know, they  come from like poverty, man.  They weren't rich kids.  They were fucking dirt poor.  Right.  I don't know why I'm telling Jack something like, you know, here's some information for  your next documentary.  Wait, what?  Has Jack ever heard your intro for Ozzy?  Because it's blue.  Oh, fucking no.  You know that Sharon called Jimmy for a special Ozzy show out there in LA?  He wasn't around.  It was, they paid a tribute in the House of Blues.  Uh-huh.  And, um, it was for the Music Fest when he did the, uh, music.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh, there was a few of us on the show to pay tribute, and she kind of asked me as, 
[02:00:30]  as, from a fan point of view, which was a great honor, of course I did it, and I got  a call in the hotel from, it was a great call, I mean, she's like, hi, it's, it's Sharon  and Ozzy, and they were on speakerphone and we're chatting, and she's like, we would love  to have you come to the show and be on stage with us, and, uh, I was, of course I went,  and, uh, she goes, look, because we're on the street, they, I'm so fucking humiliated,  that we don't have, we don't have a musical intro, which Ozzy does these funny music intros. 
[02:01:00]  So she goes, would you bring Ozzy on stage?  And, uh.  What an honor, right, Jimmy?  And you did great.  Dude, you never get to bring your fucking idol on stage, you just don't.  And I think you did a great job.  But I'm not a rock guy.  I'm not a good motive, there's no need to play it.  I'm fucking, there's, what's wrong with you?  It was a, Jack, you want to hear?  I do want to hear this.  Actually, you've built it up so much now, I kind of want to hear it.  I was waiting to tear it down.  I don't know why he's so embarrassed, I think it's one of the greatest rock intros ever.  It's really fucking awful. 
[02:01:30]  The only good thing about this was that Sharon said, Simon heard it, and it annoyed him.  Yeah, well.  Because he was in his yard somewhere, and we were outdoors.  It's quick, Jack, here it is.  All right.  Are you ready?  Come on, you motherfuckers, you're sending a Barry Manilow concert, are you ready?  Let me hear you make some noise!  I would literally, I would rather hear tape of myself blowing someone. 
[02:02:00]  Jack, I think you needed that in your film.  I know, right?  Maybe you are, Jimmy.  Maybe the director's cut, we can slide that in.  Yeah, you can get that in the director's cut.  Dude, that should have been the opening to the film, and you just had people filing out  30 seconds into the movie, like, this is going to be fucking heinous.  Jimmy kind of likes Ozzy.  But it was very funny that your mom said that Simon heard that, and it annoyed him so much  because he was in the yard trying to have a nice time.  And he's like, I heard somebody introducing your husband, which really, I'm happy that 
[02:02:30]  I fucking ruined his night of yelling.  Can't even tell what he's saying.  Oh, just, Barry Manilow, wow, real rock intro.  Of all people, why Barry Manilow?  I wanted to clarify just in case they thought it might be.  Okay.  Hey, you still do that adrenaline stuff?  I mean, I don't have to.  Are you done with that?  I don't have the show anymore, but I still, you know, I'll still go climbing.  You really enjoy getting out there?  Yeah.  What was the craziest thing you did?  Man, there were so many.  I loved when you climbed the, was it officially a mountain or like? 
[02:03:00]  It was El Cap in Yosemite.  And your parents were so nervous for you, Joe.  Oh, I was nervous for me.  Were you?  Yeah, it was like 3,600 feet, like vertical.  Wow.  I mean, it's no joke.  Are you scared of heights?  No, not scared of heights, but it's, you know, there's no room for error when you're up  that high.  So you're like a type A that likes to do stuff?  Because I hate stuff like that.  I do.  I go through phases.  Like I'm saying, I'm more kind of a, I dip into a bit of type A every now and then. 
[02:03:30]  But yeah, I just.  Anything you want to do you haven't done yet?  I want to go to Antarctica.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to go.  It's cold there.  Yeah, it is.  Bring a sweater.  Bring a couple of sweaters.  Definitely a little chilly.  Why Antarctica?  Because, I don't know.  I just, I think it's kind of, it's like the bottom of the planet.  Right.  You know, it's like a barren snow desert.  Yeah, that is.  That's actually the reasons I don't want to go there.  Yeah.  I've seen some shows on there and there's just nothing going on down there.  All right.  There's a few little labs. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  What were you set up?  And they stay there for months and months on end and there's no way out.  But if you have a medical emergency, you've got to pretty much do surgery on yourself.  It's crazy.  What would you do there?  Well, they have like different, you know, they have different kind of expeditions that  are set up down there.  Here's more ice.  Yeah, exactly.  Here's more white stuff.  I don't know if you've seen this, but there's some ice right here.  Yeah, there's ice.  And it goes down 80 miles.  Wow.  Does it really?  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's like, that thing is just, it's pretty well frozen.  So why would you go on expeditions if everything looks the same? 
[02:04:30]  Because that's cool.  I don't know.  It's like some labs and scientists.  There's like outposts and shit.  There is some cool stuff down there, you know.  It's like being on a Star Trek planet.  I guess they just found, they think there's like more oil there than in Saudi Arabia.  Drill!  Drill!  Start drilling.  Do you watch videos of your, because there's so much video of you as a kid.  Do you watch it at all, ever, and go like, ugh, oh, shut up?  Don't watch anything.  No?  Nothing.  Would you assume or think it would be embarrassing for you now to watch it? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, just being like.  He's that little shithead.  I'd smack him if I could.  Exactly.  I mean, because like, but then again, it's like, have you ever like, you ever go through  like pictures or photos when you're like 15, 16?  Yeah.  You're like, oh, it's such an awkward little shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so that's.  I don't know why he's asking that question, because we've been doing radio a long time  now.  And when we hear old tapes, like.  Oh, I know.  It's like, ugh.  We really thought that was good.  Ugh.  Ugh.  But I think that continues through your whole life.  Yeah.  Like, I think in 10 more years, you'll look back at yourself and go like, ugh, 10 years 
[02:05:30]  ago.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Well, at least I think, I hope you would think you could constantly keep improving or something.  I've heard it referred to as the asshole infinity syndrome.  Like, you always look back and think, I was an asshole last year.  Oh, thank God I'm here.  The truth of the matter is, you're always an asshole.  Every point, you're going to look back on it and think, oh, I suck.  And I watched tapes from my first couple years of doing stand-up.  It's literally humiliating.  Like, I can't.  It's exposing and fucking horrendous.  And my girlfriend wanted to watch it.  I'm like, I can't sit in the room with you.  It's not like bombing.  I can bomb. 
[02:06:00]  I don't care.  It's humiliating on a weird level.  I mean, I don't know how you do stand-up.  That's just, to me, like the scariest thing in the world.  It's like, I don't know.  I mean, if I could sing, I would do that.  Like, everybody wants to be a fucking rock star.  And we can't be.  So, like, you do anything you can.  And for me, just being funny.  You're just one guy on a stage.  And it's like, hey, if I don't make these people laugh, I am going to get just lambasted.  Yeah, but you can go down on your own terms.  The beauty of fucking, the beauty of, like, when I'm in a comedy cellar sometimes, I'm fucking bombing. 
[02:06:30]  Like, I know I'm going to bring them all with me.  Like, none of us are going to feel good when this is over.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I know I can fucking wreck their night a little bit if I have to.  So that's kind of satisfying.  We're being told he has to go.  Jack's that are, okay.  Because you have a lot of interviews today.  Busy man.  The documentary is, and again, as an Aussie freak, it's easy for me to say it, but even  if you're not, Roland's not an Aussie fan, and he fucking loved it.  He did love it, yeah.  He's a Springsteen fan.  Ah, the boss man.  But, I mean, hardcore, probably the biggest fan in the country. 
[02:07:00]  Like, pretty much homo form.  Does he wear, like, plain white t-shirts everywhere?  No, every t-shirt he has has some kind of Springsteen crap on it.  Every day.  He won't stop.  He's been to, how many shows?  He's been to, how many shows?  Bruce.  250 or something like that.  It's ridiculous.  It's a ridiculous thing.  One for every pound.  But he loved it, is the point we're making him.  And I don't even think, I don't think he knows one Black Sabbath or Aussie song, and he loved it.  And he loved the concert footage, which was really, really, really good.  It was a perfect mix of interviews.  Aussie's fucking, he's comic funny in it. 
[02:07:30]  And I don't mean accidentally funny.  He's saying funny shit.  He's hilarious.  He's hilarious.  He's always been great on the show here, and when you hear interviews, you know, he's always a funny guy, man.  And it's very, there's parts of it that are moving, very sad family stuff.  But it's not maudlin'.  It was really, really well done.  And where can people, before you go, where can people see this before Tribeca?  It's playing two more times.  I don't even know where, I'm sure I have it written down somewhere.  But yeah, if you go to the Tribeca Film Festival website, it's playing two more times this week, well, during the festival. 
[02:08:00]  And then hopefully we're going to sell it in the next couple weeks.  Okay.  And I know you tweeted, I think last night, you were nervous as hell.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's three and a half years of your life, and you don't know how it's going to do.  Exactly.  Are you relieved today, Jack?  I was, like, drained yesterday when I, I mean, I didn't even go out and celebrate.  I was out for, like, an hour and a half, went back to the hotel.  How do you celebrate now if you're not doing the...  Red Bulls and, you know.  Yeah, the internet.  It's a great way to celebrate alone, fucking...  My forearm is just ripped. 
[02:08:30]  Doesn't feel like celebrating, though.  I like that movie, like, what is it, like, a lady in the, what was that movie, the M. Night Shyamalan movie,  where the guy had, like, the water...  A lady in the water.  A lady in the water, and the guy had, like, the one dieseled arm.  That's me.  When did you get the feeling, like, oh, my God, this film's going to be accepted.  People are definitely enjoying this.  Within, like, five minutes, when everyone was, like, in the theater, kind of cheering and clapping...  What a great feeling.  ...and, like, really getting into it, and it was, you know, that was when I was, like, okay. 
[02:09:00]  Nice.  You know.  And then it all went away, all that stress, right?  And all that tension.  A little bit.  I mean, it was real emotional for me, too.  Like, I kind of, it was really, you know, especially kind of sitting next to my mom and dad,  and they were, like, tearing up at parts, you know, especially, like, you know, I was  saying, like, the Randy stuff, and that was, you know, it was, it was, I felt, I feel good  about it.  Right on.  Good for you, man.  It's fantastic, and, you know, you did a great fucking job, man, honestly.  But, you know, I can't take all the credit, you know, I had amazing, amazing team of guys,  you know, the two Mike directors, and, you know, Mark Weingarten, Jordan Tapas, I mean, 
[02:09:30]  they, you know, really, everyone, it became a total passion project for everyone, and that's  what kind of, you know, it helps.  I mean, about six months ago, I was getting so fed up, I was like, all right, I literally  was about to sell it to one of my directors, I was like, I just, I'm getting so drained  from this whole process, I was like, I need to jump ship.  You know, I just kind of knuckled in.  Any other, real quickly, any other interests that you might want to delve into next? 
[02:10:00]  I mean, there's talks about doing the Black Sabbath horror movies.  Oh, shit.  So, yeah, that's, you know, not, it's, you know, it's not going to be about Sabbath by  killing people or anything.  I like the Kiss movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, geezer hitting him with a vegetable, because he won't touch meat.  Before we let Jack go, you want to give him Ozzy's Beatles books that he forgot, or?  No, oh, yeah, that's a long story.  I bought it out for his birthday, I got Ozzy's Beatles books, but he was busy.  Ozzy was in here.  No, I'm going to give him to Ozzy in three hours. 
[02:10:30]  Do you want to give him to Jack to get that?  No, because Ozzy would be like, what the fuck are these?  No, I'll give him to him when he comes back.  Ozzy was here, Jimmy wrapped Beatles books individually.  Each book had different wrapping paper.  Ozzy opened them up, he showed appreciation, but he left them behind.  And Jimmy's been set ever since.  I have, it's one of the funniest clips ever.  It is.  It's fucking Ozzy walking down the hall, and those books just sitting there.  And it served me right.  You know, the thing about that, though, is that it's not just you.  Oh, yeah.  I got my dad this awesome Mont Blanc, John Lennon limited edition pen, and it was in this 
[02:11:00]  nice box.  I was like, Dad, look what I got you.  And he opens it up, and he goes, oh, great, and just puts it down.  Oh, no.  Oh.  You know what it is?  It's like he just, he's not, it's not that he does it intentionally.  He's just like, he kind of doesn't need for anything, because he has everything.  So when you get him something, he's like, okay, thanks.  We're going to get Ozzy for the next time.  It was just happening to be his birthday.  I'm going to frame a photo of he and I, and I'm going to give it to him. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, God.  You asshole.  But Jimmy's mistake to this day, the books weighed like 60.  They were the heavy, big books.  There's a lot of shit on the Beatles.  What do you want?  Then I should give him something nice and light.  I should have gotten one small Beatles book, but I'm just a compulsive asshole.  You should just get him like a little pet beetle.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Just like a dung beetle, or like a stink bug or something.  All right, they're going to kill us.  Yeah, Roland's panicking.  Listen, Jack, thank you, man.  It's a great documentary, and I'll plug these.  I'll give the dates as soon as we come back to when it's playing again. 
[02:12:00]  And it was a pleasure meeting you, man.  Hey, you too, guys.  We've met most of you now.  Jack Osborne, everyone.  Come back and see us.  Absolutely.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Jack Osborne was very nice.  Very down to earth.  Yeah, it was cool.  Very cool.  We got Dimitri Martin coming in in a few minutes.  Yes.  We're guest loaded today.  We're guest heavy today.  Guest heavy.  I'm such an asshole.  I tweeted the...  What, you got something else to say after that? 
[02:12:30]  You know what?  You're right.  That really is all that needed to be said.  No, Jimmy.  I ain't heard a guy while he's down.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That should end with a period every time.  Oh.  There's two more showings of the...  God bless Ozzy Osborne.  The 28th at 9 p.m., which is Thursday, at the SVA Theater here in New York.  AMC Lowe's Village 30th.  That's Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m.  These will obviously sell out, because there was a 1,000-seat venue on fucking Easter that  was sold out. 
[02:13:00]  So it's a tremendous documentary, and I would suggest going to it highly.  Very, very good.  Okay, we got a couple things before Dimitri Martin comes in.  Mm-hmm.  Are you going to do this royal wedding thing?  Are you going to follow this shit?  Not in the least am I going to watch that drivel.  Who cares?  When does that happen?  Tomorrow?  About the English.  Is it tomorrow?  I think it's charming.  With their dumb fucking wedding, and the pomp and circumstance.  What is this? 
[02:13:30]  1750?  Fifth.  Who cares?  Why 1750?  Well, that's like, you know, the British were pretty big then.  That was their time?  Yeah, yeah.  They were pretty fucking big.  They were kicking ass all over the place.  1750.  That was before we threw them a fucking beat.  I knew you had to go before 1776.  We had to go before we threw them a beat.  But 1750 seems to be maybe something you pulled...  Them in France were kind of duking it out a little bit.  Duking it out a bit.  Whatever, but...  Yeah.  Hey, the Today Show.  Yeah?  From when? 
[02:14:00]  Well, from...  That's a good point.  I was waiting for you to say yesterday, and I was going to do a whole thing.  I would have said yesterday if this was Tuesday, but yesterday was Sunday, which makes it  tough to say it was yesterday, so then I got really confused, because I knew where you  were going, and I wanted to help you out with your bit, but yesterday was Easter Sunday.  Sunday.  Didn't work.  The Today Show interviews a woman ready for this.  They're getting ready for the royal wedding.  Yeah.  They interviewed a woman named Kate Middleton. 
[02:14:30]  But wait a minute.  Isn't that the bride's name?  Well, it is, Anthony.  So they just found someone that has the same name, and they interviewed her.  Why?  And the only reason I'm playing this, because it goes back to another old fucking hack radio  bit that a lot of morning guys did, where they go through the phone book and like, hey,  today we're going to talk to Jim Morrison.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  And they would call up...  But they actually would, if they really want to trick their listeners, they would get guys 
[02:15:00]  that, you know, are still alive, like, you know, I don't know, give me one, like, fucking  help me out here.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley, yes.  Of the rock band...  But it's a hack bit, because, you know, guys share names with famous people, so as a  morning guy, you have to call some of these people, and they're all confused, and you have  to ask them if, for example, if it's Jim Morrison, are you a fan of The Doors, and usually the  guy isn't, and, well, how could you not, because your name is Jim Morrison. 
[02:15:30]  Well, you know, that's all I heard growing up, but, oh, gosh.  Well, I can't believe that Today Show is actually doing a really hack radio bit, so.  Kate tells us an extremely interesting story of co-workers playing crazy pranks based on  her name.  No.  Because she shares the same name as that broad.  So, we all know Kate Middleton is the Princess Bride, but did you know she also sells bicycles  and spends her time teaching spin classes in Massachusetts? 
[02:16:00]  We are talking about the other Kate Middleton, sharing the same name as the Queen to be, and  our Kate Middleton joins us now.  Good morning.  Good to see you.  Hi.  This has been quite a ride you have been on.  Now, this started when we first heard Kate Middleton as a potential member of the royal  family, and your phone starts ringing, right?  The phone started ringing, actually, after a newspaper article came out about having the 
[02:16:30]  same name as Prince William's fiancé, and my co-worker started playing around with it  a little bit and said, oh, she's not here yet.  She's having tea with the Queen.  So, reporters are going to need to call.  Yes.  I can't believe they said that.  I want to work with those people.  They sound like a hoot.  I want to work with them.  Why can't we have fun like that around here?  Here's the fun thing. 
[02:17:00]  She's having tea with the Queen.  Oh, see?  She's a prostitute.  That's funny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's actually a hooker.  Like, God damn it, her regular's here.  And he makes her fucking, like, he sits on her face, and she tongues his asshole, and  he says, lick my ass.  I hate Middleton.  And, oh, she's having tea with the Queen.  Then she'll eat the ass of fucking Herman the Accountant.  Is that life again there, Jimmy?  No!  Kate continues to talk about it. 
[02:17:30]  It doesn't stop when you guys want it to.  All right.  Kate continues to talk about her mundane life.  So what's it like now?  You walk through grocery stores.  You see, you know...  What is it like?  What are you talking about?  What is it like for what?  To see someone with the same fucking name?  You see, you know, your name in magazines.  You hear your name all over, you know, TV reports.  Do you like it?  Is it annoying?  Where do you stand with all of this? 
[02:18:00]  It's pretty funny.  And people around me have always called me a princess anyway, so...  This story is great!  I don't blame you, man.  I don't blame you.  This is terrific stuff.  Ant, get involved here, please. 
[02:18:30]  I can't.  I'm just...  I'm loving it.  This is great shit.  I guess it's kind of fitting.  So it kind of fits.  But this goes back even before the engagement.  Wow.  The first time you heard about this, I understand you were applying for a job.  That's right.  I was applying...  I wonder what a job she was...  I wonder what job she was applying for.  Yes, applying for a job.  Well, I was applying for the job as someone who scoops the shit off of sheets of AIDS patients  the way they do your crumbs at Morton's.  Holy crap.  With that little crumb fucking thing. 
[02:19:00]  What is that thing called?  I don't know.  It's magic.  It's that metal thing.  Get rid of the crumbs.  Oh, shit.  That's what Elizabeth Berkley looks like these days.  She held up, huh?  No?  Well, look at me a little sharp.  What do you mean a little sharp?  Her features are a little sharp.  It happens when you get older.  And, like, her eyes, like...  She's got the thyroid.  You don't think she could close them when she goes to bed at night?  No, look at her.  She has too much white around them like a fucking psycho.  It's crazy.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Exactly.  Either she's had work done or she's fucking insane.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Or both.  Or neither.  There's something going on there.  Dude, please.  Why'd the laughs all of a sudden start?  I know.  This fucking story had me gone.  Hilarious.  Is there a better road song than Turn the Page?  Random thought of the day, I understand.  Probably.  I heard that driving because I was in fucking miserable traffic.  The name game.  The name game's pretty good.  And do we go Bob Seger or Metallica?  Both versions.  Very nice.  I think, yeah.  I love Metallica, but I think you gotta go Seger with that one. 
[02:20:00]  Turn the Page is such a great fucking road song.  No?  Well, it's pretty long.  You're not a big Bob Seger fan?  No, I kind of...  I was into it, like, you know, growing up and shit.  And then I heard Night Moves, too.  I had a classic rock weekend, I think.  Oh, there you go.  Is there a better song, though?  Yeah.  When you're just driving?  I don't know.  This might, like, lull me to sleep.  You don't like this?  I thought you would, like, Turn the Page.  I need something fucking...  Like, rockin'. 
[02:20:30]  East of Omaha.  All right, we're going to have to play this.  It was just a random thought.  Kate continues to talk about her mundane life.  The first time you heard about this, I understand you were applying for a job.  That's right.  I was applying for a job, and I got a call back, and the person said,  Well, I didn't know you were dating Prince William.  I'm saying...  What did you say back, Kate?  Quick, get to the audio. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  She leads a hell of a life.  What did the guy say back?  I don't know.  What happened?  What did she say back?  And I got a call back, and the person said,  Well, I didn't know you were dating Prince William.  And I said, Well, what are you talking about?  I didn't know I was dating Prince William either.  She didn't know either, she says.  Whoa, slow down.  Whoa.  He says it, she just says it back. 
[02:21:30]  How do they get anything done?  This is terrific.  What are you talking about?  I didn't know I was dating Prince William either.  And he said, I Googled your name,  and I found that you, in fact,  are dating Prince William.  Wow.  Notice he didn't say,  You got the job.  He said,  So it appears that you're dating Prince William.  Holy no story.  Holy non-fucking story.  It's funny you should say that, Anthony,  because the Today Show anchors struggle  to fill the last 30 seconds of the interview time.  Wow. 
[02:22:00]  Because they fit everything  in a nice little slot over there.  Yeah.  Hey, good thing your name is not Diana.  Diana, otherwise you might not be able  to go through tunnels.  Oh, why did I say that?  Coke Logic is going with  Running Down a Dream  as a fine road song.  Yes, it is.  A very good road song.  I know you like that one, Jimmy.  I really do.  I remember you talking about that one.  Yep.  Because me and Dale were singing  A little runaway  He shot himself 
[02:22:30]  He ate a bullet  He said it was tasty  Can I be part of that bit?  I like that one.  If you wish, yes.  I'll be background guy, though.  I don't want to take too much.  I'll be like background vocals  in that bit, please.  What the World Needs Now by Cracker  and then Coke Logic  ruins it with that.  How is that a good road song,  Coke Logic?  Oh, what the fuck?  Exactly. 
[02:23:00]  What does he know  about the road anyway?  He's a fucking shunnin'.  He is.  Why don't they just scream  at Coke Logic?  And I would say  an extreme alcoholic.  Oh, he's a fucking drunk.  He's a sot.  He's a sot.  He really is.  And then this idiot  goes with Running on Empty  as a staple road.  Oh, idiot.  Sarah from Buffalo.  Sorry, Sarah.  Oh, I was going to call him  a fruit.  Go Sabres, Sarah.  Let's do this.  Game seven.  Let's do this.  Are we done with that?  I don't know.  More comedy.  I really don't know.  I want some more laughs, please.  All of a sudden  we went into road songs.  I want to hear because it's just... 
[02:23:30]  You're not a Jackson Brown fan.  I'm trying to get some Browns for...  He stinks.  That's why we're not fans.  He's horrible.  You always hated him, right?  Yeah, because that was like  a concert I had to take a girl to.  You don't like stay?  What stay?  It was his biggest hit.  That was his big one.  Why don't you stay?  That was before Lawyers in Love.  Oh, Lawyers in Love.  That's a great video that was.  Are you a fan of Radar Love?  That's coming in.  And also, Robert Plant, Larry from Connecticut.  I like this song, actually.  Big Log.  No. 
[02:24:00]  You never were a fan of the Big Log?  No, not Big Log.  Too slow.  Yeah.  And mundane like this  fucking Today Show broad.  Yeah.  See, that's why I did that.  See how we brought it right back around?  Right back to...  Here's the last clip.  Yeah, the Yankers try to fill up the last 30 seconds because, like I said, they have to  fit everything into a slot over their horse.  So this is going to be really awkward.  You haven't...  Are you dating someone named Will?  Because that would really be interesting.  No, I'm not dating someone.  Are you looking for a prince?  No, I'm dating somebody named Leroy.  And he likes to call me Yo Middleton while he fucks my face and vagina. 
[02:24:30]  He's what we call a pussy wrecker.  All right.  Back to you, Matt.  Back to you, Matt.  Yeah.  I want you to call a...  What's the word?  I think they call a coal digger or something.  Oh, coal burner.  Coal burner.  Yeah.  Hey, you coal burner.  Yeah.  Yeah, snow burner.  Yeah.  Are you dating someone named William?  Who gives a fuck?  Philip from Oklahoma just came up with the greatest road song ever.  Oh, yeah.  Well, which one? 
[02:25:00]  I don't say.  Oh.  Why would I say?  Because then we could all put it on and...  And agree?  Drive.  Wherever I may roam.  No.  No?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you and Metallica?  I love Metallica.  What did they ever do to you?  I had a problem.  I had a falling out with Lars.  You did?  No.  You might have, though, because he's kind of that guy.  I just want it to sound like I was powerful, like Lars and I were equals.  Yeah.  Here's the last 30 seconds of that horrible Today Show thing.  You haven't...  Are you dating someone named Will?  Because that would really be interesting. 
[02:25:30]  No, I'm not dating...  No.  I'm dating someone named Hitler.  Funny story.  Funny story.  I was going to Temple, and he was throwing eggs at us.  Why would you ask if you're dating someone named Will?  Like I said, they had to fill up the last 30 seconds, and they ran out of questions.  You haven't...  Are you dating someone named Will?  Because that would really be interesting.  No, I'm not dating him.  No, I'm not.  I'm sucking someone's cock name, Will.  He won't date me, though, because he's in a bad abusive marriage, so he makes me suck 
[02:26:00]  his dick in the back of his car, and his balls are onion-y.  Onion Balls Willie, his name is.  Everyone knows Onion Balls Willie.  He's a legend on the fucking underground fight circuit.  Are you looking for a prince?  I am looking for a prince.  Are you looking for a prince?  Ah, see.  She should say no.  That makes a romantic.  I don't fuck purple-loving black midgets.  Thank you, anyway.  No.  I'm not looking for a prince at all.  I'm looking for more of a snoop. 
[02:26:30]  You know, a prince is too light-skinned and fruity.  Yeah, I like a dark one who I know will really fuck my spine into a bad place.  I am looking for a prince, but not William.  Okay, but not that William.  Kate Middleton, it's great to have you on.  No, it wasn't.  Are you guys going to be watching the wedding, by the way?  What time is the wedding?  It's like 4 a.m.  Here, the coverage will start at 4 a.m., so that can't inconvenience you in any way.  I'll be dreaming of the wedding.  She's honest.  DVR it.  Exactly.  Kate Middleton.  Other Kate Middleton.  Real Kate Middleton.  Exactly.  Just Kate Middleton.  Thank you so much. 
[02:27:00]  Up next.  Hey, man.  We could like.  Wow.  Live simulcast that shit.  Oh, yeah?  Well, you at least could take a peek.  Great.  Dimitri Martin is outside the studio.  Oh, here?  We should invite him in to say hi.  Oh, good, good, good.  Thank God.  Oh, here comes.  Hey, what's up, Dimitri?  How you doing, man?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yep.  How are you, bro?  Take a seat.  Grab some headphones.  You and the Nord didn't know each other?  Many years.  Yeah.  Many years. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Many years.  Way back.  Very good.  I remember when Dimitri was a younger guy starting out, you know, just kind of, you know, doing  well.  We would take rides together and was he fucking famous now?  Dude, really good job.  And what was the, what was the, take me home tonight?  Oh, yeah.  Take me home tonight.  Oh, you fucking hilarious in that.  Thanks, man.  Guy plays a guy in a wheelchair.  Really, really funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To me, Norton is one of the most, I'm not kissing your ass, I'm just being honest.  Because when you start, you go to a lot of clubs and see a lot of stuff. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Norton's prolific.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Seriously.  One of the few guys who always has new stuff.  We talk about that.  I don't understand why there's more comics that are like that.  It's not, it's sadly not many people like that.  It's him.  It's only, it's probably only you and Kevin Meany that actually write new stuff.  It's funny, I did, I did Fitzsimmons' podcast at the Caroline.  Oh, yeah, cool.  And he said that Meany was on the first show, but Galifianakis was there.  So I'm like, well, did you bring Zach out?  And he goes, well, no, I had Kevin Meany.  How fucking loyal are you?  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  Kevin Meany would fucking hang himself to bring Zach out.  So you're doing fucking great, dude.  Thanks, yeah.  You really are on fire.  What is your, what is your book?  We actually just got caught.  You know, it's called, this is a book.  Yeah, it's a grab bag.  It's just like little short essays, like the old Woody Allen books and Steve Martin stuff.  You know, my version of that kind of stuff where short stories and I put some of my little drawings in there and stuff.  Yeah.  It's funny, you know, I used to hang out at the cellar.  Not a lot, but I'd stop by there.  I hardly ever got up there.  But it's funny, when you start in New York, you think that is comedy. 
[02:29:00]  It's the biggest in the country.  But it's also specific.  It's also a small town in a weird way.  And so I do like the, call them the alternative rooms and stuff.  But then when you get to go out and you go on the road,  you go to each city and you find your people in each city.  You know what I mean?  So like, I do a show and then after the show, like, guys who kind of look like me.  Like, the guys who were on the math team in high school, you kind of find,  it's a big country, so you find your people.  But it's interesting that New York is this like intersection. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Where I'd be sitting at a table with Norton and Patrice or Geraldo.  It's unbelievable.  But you know what I mean?  But then it kind of scatters.  And you go find your people.  What Demetrius is saying is a toxic table of people with addictive personalities and problems  and self-sabotagers.  Thank you for the translate.  You couldn't have picked three bigger self-sabotagers than me, Geraldo, and Patrice?  How about Keith Robinson for people that should fucking throw themselves into a fucking canal?  Jesus.  But like a shallow canal just to swim a little. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  We want his spine cracked.  We don't want him actually dead.  You have a real cult following, though, man.  It's like you tapped into something, and there's a weird thing with comedians and alternative  comedians, but you're a funny act.  I mean, and like your material's funny, and it's like, it's good.  It's not, I don't know what alternative, what do you even consider alternative?  Yeah, it's funny.  I remember when I started Luna Lounge, there were certain rooms in the city that were not  clubs.  You know, I couldn't get up in the clubs anyway.  The thing was, I wanted to be in the clubs, and they told me I was too low energy and cerebral. 
[02:30:30]  It's like, if you're low energy, no one will know.  That's like kiss of death.  Right.  Todd Barry always deals with that.  They call you low energy, and like, you're branded.  You're low energy.  Holy shit.  We can't use you.  You know?  Too boring.  Whatever their problem is with it.  And Todd's a funny dude.  Todd's funny.  Todd comes up with tons of shit.  The problem is he doesn't look good on TV.  He looks like a screensaver.  Todd Barry just lurks in the corner.  But he's a really good comic, man.  He's a very funny dude.  Yeah, Todd's great.  He's great at crowd work and stuff, too.  Yeah, so for me, I think what a lot of people didn't like about alternative comedy is people 
[02:31:00]  bringing their notebooks up and keeping their head down and meandering through.  It became a parody of alternative comedy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the person with the stool and the pad.  Yeah.  And people would just make fun of it.  And it's funny, it's just the idea of commitment.  Whether, for me, music or stand-up, or just commit to your shit.  Just commit to the thing that you do.  I think when people don't commit, it's lame.  Just trying it out.  Just trying it out.  Yeah, like, I don't give a shit.  You know, or it's like anti-comedy. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Where it's like, the joke is that it's not funny.  It's like, man, people are paying and sitting there to listen to you.  It's funny, what I do is so old-fashioned in a way because it's just jokes.  You know what I mean?  I loved Stephen Wright when I was a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  You've talked about Dice.  Like, it's funny, you go back, any comic, and you can say who you saw when you were  whatever, whatever age you were.  It does influence you.  There's an imprint on your head.  Yeah, true.  And you kind of end up on a track.  I just saw Richard Pryor's, I haven't seen a Richard Pryor special in a long time, and  they aired one on Comedy Central. 
[02:32:00]  He's wearing a red.  On a sunset, yeah.  Oh, man, it's so good.  It's just crazy how just completely great that guy was.  And that was my least favorite of the three because that was where he burned himself  and he says, I'm not going to say a nigger anymore.  It was kind of an emotional.  He had gone to Africa.  That was a...  I picked up the slack.  Yeah, you certainly did, but when Richard left off, thank God Anthony was around with  a fucking white family in Long Island.  Finally, somebody said it.  That's all I need.  But yeah, that's a...  It is weird.  Like, when you talk about commitment, too, you're right. 
[02:32:30]  Like, guys, because when guys are pretending they don't care about being funny, they really  do.  Oh, fuck that.  Yeah.  Like, I don't mind a guy working on him.  Because, like, Janine used to go on stage, Janine Garofalo, and she would have, like, a notebook,  but she was a funny comic.  I mean, people started the parodies.  Oh, she sucked, but she didn't suck.  She was funny.  It's when people who really do want to be funny, it's like guys that do spoken word.  Yeah.  And they don't like...  You know, I like Henry Rollins, but he wants to do stand-up.  He wants to do stand-up.  They want to be incidentally funny, which is funny without the risk.  Right.  Yes. 
[02:33:00]  And it's like, if you commit to it, there's a risk there.  That's great.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so true.  It's doing stand-up without the risk.  Because if people don't like it or find it funny, they're the assholes, because I'm  just trying to be profound here on stage, doing spoken word.  And it is just a cop-out to be able to go up on stage, try to do stand-up without any  repercussions if you suck.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a little cowardly.  That is.  But you always had...  I wouldn't classify you as an alternative because of low energy, but, you know, again,  there's a lot of, like...  I'm right.  Low energy.  Todd Barry, low energy. 
[02:33:30]  A lot of guys don't have high energy.  As long as the material's there, and it's funny.  It's funny, too, over time, I think any creative thing you do, the truth just wiggles its way  out.  Right.  Yeah.  How much stuff can you come up with?  I mean, for radio, you guys have to fill so much time.  It's just like, either you have the chops or you don't.  Like, you have to...  Had it.  You know what I mean?  But you have to do it.  It's like one week, two weeks, two years, five years, ten...  Once you're, like, ten years into something, either you're stealing...  People who steal jokes, for example, like, it just comes out.  Like, you can't...  You can get away, right? 
[02:34:00]  Someone steals something once, twice, and then after a while, it's just like the truth  is there.  It's like, dude's a thief, you know, whoever it is.  And that's a horrible...  We all know who you're talking about.  Yeah.  You know what, Rogan...  Richard Pryor.  Yes, he stole...  He actually stole a lot of shit from a fucking...  I couldn't think of a horrible fucking white comic.  I'm sure I should.  I'm sure I'll think of 30 as soon as the door closes, but that's why I'm here, because  I improv.  I can't think of a comic's name on the fucking Opie and Anthony show.  I can't either.  I'm trying to bank it.  I know.  We're both trying to find an awful comic.  Lenny Schultz, who wasn't awful, but, you know, go crazy, Lenny.  That's an obscure one. 
[02:34:30]  I heard Lenny Schultz jerked off so much that his dick had calluses, like he couldn't  have sex anymore.  No, not Charlie Callus.  Yes, I heard about Lenny Schultz, if anyone knows.  Go crazy, Lenny.  More pigs, Lenny.  Wow.  So the book is...  This is a book.  And again, that's your style.  That is...  Simple.  What was the name of your show?  It was...  These are jokes.  Oh, that was my CD.  My show is called Important Things.  You know, I like generic stuff.  I just keep it simple.  And it's funny.  I was talking to somebody recently, and I was thinking about the cellar in comics and 
[02:35:00]  talking to comics here.  Some guys live...  You know, they get on stage, first thing they say is like, been sober, you know, 15 years  or whatever.  So they have some real shit to talk about.  Yeah, yeah.  That's their real life.  I was on the math team when I was in high school.  It is what it is.  You know what I mean?  So you find your...  You just find how to be authentic.  Like, what's your thing?  Right.  So yeah, it's like...  For me, it's basic, simple deconstruction.  There's a...  It's like...  So good shitter reading, is what you're saying?  This is great for the shitter.  Some of this makes you shit, so it's got some laxative orientation. 
[02:35:30]  To those pages.  Yeah, it's weird.  Like, I remember when Aziz Anzara, who's been doing some spots at the cellar, when he first  came around, Manny, who owned this...  I loved him.  He loved...  He saw something in Aziz, who was just starting.  He was very green.  Nice guy.  But you know, it's like the comedian, we just kind of joked with him.  We always tell Manny, like, we know you want to fuck that guy.  Like, we were just teasing him.  Because Manny had never taken any interest in young comedians.  He didn't care.  So we're like, you know...  And you see him now, and he's got a fucking...  He's through the roof.  That's ridiculous, right?  Yeah.  He's through the roof.  Some people know how to use that social media stuff. 
[02:36:00]  I'm not a natural for that stuff.  You know what I mean?  Some people just know how to make it click, and it's like, yeah, I get three million followers.  That's crazy.  I love that people have followers.  It's just...  It's so ridiculous, man.  Followers.  It's just ridiculous, man.  The word followers, that is kind of fucked up.  It's some obnoxious shit.  It really is obnoxious.  How many followers do you have?  More accurately, I have 102,000 people who are kind of bored with their own lives.  And find my tiny bunch of interesting.  It's too wordy.  That's the problem.  You cracked the 100,000 mark, though, huh?  Yeah, it's against...  Are you doing the road?  Do you do the road a lot now? 
[02:36:30]  I go out in the beginning of the year.  I do a lot of beginning of the year stuff to make my money.  And I'm touring with Burr, Brewer, and Attel.  We're doing this thing.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  So, oh, actually, before I forget, Jesus, Seattle goes on sale this Friday.  I'm announcing it today.  We're going to be in Seattle July 1st.  That's awesome.  That will sell out because BJ Shea is pushing it, and tickets on sale Friday.  So, yeah, I don't go on that much.  When I can stay here, I stay here.  How are you guys enjoying Sirius and everything?  Matt, you know what?  It's all right.  It's pretty cool to be able to get on and talk about what you want to talk about the way you want to talk about it. 
[02:37:00]  Does it change the rhythm of even your thoughts?  You're like, I can say that word.  I think so, yeah.  Other than regular radio, it's a pain in the ass trying to work around it.  And people are like, well, you have to be more clever.  It's great to have to.  No, it's a pain in the ass.  If I want to say fuck for something, I'm not going to say it every two seconds, but that's how I talk.  The cool thing is, I bet you if you could graph everybody who went from traditional to satellite, their first week of shows or first month, there's just tons of cursing. 
[02:37:30]  You're like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  The fuck show.  And then it evens out, probably, where it's useful.  And then it just becomes the way you normally talk in life.  But you wind up, you know what I found, too?  It becomes content.  It's not even language.  We could say fuck, but on regular radio, it got so bad, you can't address certain things.  You can't do anything racial.  yeah just talking about  his sexual intercourse  was crazy  it was like childishly  unfunny  and you're never funnier  when you have to  fucking walk through  a minefield  Pryor was funny 
[02:38:00]  on the Tonight Show  but it was funnier live  Carlin too  you're never funnier  when you're like  under a boss cut off  yeah that's true  and so it's like  90 something percent  of it's not like  so dark and terrible  anyway  you know what I mean  the vernacular  it doesn't always match  like the intent  or like you're talking  about something so evil  or terrible  and people shouldn't hear it  it's just the way we talk  it's like  I don't know  sometimes the technology  doesn't actually catch up  with his life  and it might be  what's going to offend advertisers  or what's going to offend  a group that's going to 
[02:38:30]  give your advertisers shit  you were  I remember when I first  what were you doing  when I first started  knowing you  which is I guess  going back almost 15 years now  like just for jobs and stuff  yeah weren't you in school  for a  yeah I was in law school  at NYU  I dropped out  after two years  and then I was like  and that's right by  what was the Boston Comedy Club  right  and then yeah  I was doing open mics  and stuff  I was temping  I got work just answering phones  like on Wall Street  and stuff  and then I was a proofreader  so I worked like a full week  doing that kind of stuff  oh really  and if I could get up anywhere 
[02:39:00]  I'd bark with Louis Schaefer  oh god  Louis fucking Schaefer  was one of the funniest dudes ever  man  and he moved to England  he got two kids  yeah  I think he's divorced now  oh is he divorced  I think so  but yeah  he got married  he moved to England  got married  had two kids  and he does  like the festivals  over there and stuff  I heard he's had  like a lukewarm reception  yeah  Louis was a guy  with glasses  who would stand outside  in a really bad sports coat  and he used to sprinkle rosas  when he went on stage  like Louis was a fucking  odd character  he was an odd character  yeah  always wore a blue blazer  right 
[02:39:30]  he had the same outfit  every night  and he barked  and had the  you know  bark is stand on the street  and tell people  yeah  did you start in New York  no I started in Jersey  I was doing the road  for like five years  which fucking  Colin Quinn loves to point out  you know  it was funny  when he said divorce  he goes  yeah the opening of the Sopranos  when you're going around  and you see 280  that's your career  fucking elitist idiot  thinks he's a fucking  I really want to spit  on Colin right now  you know  I got a  not the funniest Colin story  but  I was walking on the street 
[02:40:00]  once in Midtown  I hadn't seen Colin in years  and it was like 55th  or somewhere around there  middle of the day  and I came to a corner  and I almost bumped into a guy  and it was Colin Quinn  walking the other direction  and he's like  hey man  I was like  hey how you doing  and he had with him  something like a folder  and he was like  kind of sheepish  and I was like  what's that  he's like  and it was music  he was like  taking guitar lessons  did you know Colin  plays guitar  no I did not know  that  I knew Norm would like  fucking sneak  what an asshole  what did you want 
[02:40:30]  to serenade people  with their fucking shrubs  I knew Norm would like that  oh I love it  that's good  it was just kind of like  oh yeah  I'm taking guitar lessons  what you should have done  and nobody would have  faulted you  if you just  knocked his papers  into a puddle  you know how fucking  awful he must be  a guitar  with those fucking  those frail  fucking  red stick fingers  red stick  we saw him walking  down the street  it's like a mob name  and he was  he was going into  an OTB  years ago  yeah  he plays the pod  he plays the horses  I always want to do  a character 
[02:41:00]  like in a movie  or a story  who's really rich  and when you ask her  if you don't mind me asking  what did your father do  and she's like  OTB  he got very lucky  with OTB  just very lucky  playing the horses  you know what  there's probably more of them  than you'd think  people who just fucking  yeah their parents  made their money  doing shitty stuff  or drug dealers kids  you never think of that  you just think  they're always successful  business people  or something  we really got to get  Colin a guitar  because he comes in  whenever he can  oh I would love  to hear it  how long ago is this  I want to see how many  lessons he had  a couple years ago  oh my shit 
[02:41:30]  that fucking sneak  next time we have  a guitar behind those TVs  that's way from Jersey  yeah yeah  my first five years  were in Jersey  and then I just started  coming to New York  on Monday nights  I would with Eric McMahon  and Florentine  I'd go to the strip  and just fucking hang out  because you wanted to be  part of the city  you know this was the scene  and fucking Lucian  wouldn't look at it  you remember Lucian  oh yeah yeah  I was around then  he treated us  fucking horrendous  and none of the city  comments  first guys in the city  would be nice to me  the first three guys  that were respected  that were nice to me 
[02:42:00]  were Louis  Marc Maron  and Colin  those were the first  three guys  that actually really  treated me nice  for me it was probably  DC Benny  Lenny Marcus  oh right  and Geraldo  but Lenny wouldn't  fall under the established  Lenny would probably  just fall under the fucking  the nerds  who were barely making ends meet  he's a good friend of mine too  so fuck Lenny Marcus  because I'm from Jersey too  I'm from Tom's River  down by Seaside Heights  chicks are sexy in Tom's River  do you know  I've never met a girl  I didn't want to fuck  who was from Tom's River  is that right  yes  there's something fucking  juicy and really hot  about chicks in Tom's River 
[02:42:30]  it's a weird intersection  I'm sorry to say that  is it your publicist  are you with the book company  yeah she's from California  okay  so far from Tom's River  apologize for the language  oh you're with the book  she's like don't talk  don't talk about my yellow boots  Norton broke the fifth wall  yeah  nah but you know  I tend to say things  and I forget  there's people in the room  who aren't fans of the show  they're just nice people  doing their jobs  I'm the fucking pig  well yes  that's your job  that's your self-awareness  oh I know  yeah yeah  he's not shy for a second  that's the good thing 
[02:43:00]  about comics though  it's funny if you hang out  with actors versus comics  I mean because they're  different  some people try to do  both or whatever  yeah  comics  like an actor  will wear sunglasses  like at night  or you know  one of those  and nobody will say anything  comic you're crucified  if you have them on  for a second  you're crucified  for the whole night  you just get ripped apart  you gotta be aware  I don't know what it is  there's something about  comics that just  it's the insecurity  yet this illusion  of such a confident person  because you're up 
[02:43:30]  on the stage alone  yeah and there's  just an honesty  I think once you pull  all the bullshit away  it's like  nobody can get you  on anything in a way  if you're full of shit  I think you're in big trouble  that is like  a freeing thing  that happens  even on this  dopey ass show  like over the years  there have been days  where we're sitting here  going like  oh fuck  there's nothing in the news  there's this  and then you're like  hey my friend  tried to blow me  in a tree fork  and by the way 
[02:44:00]  that's him telling  that story  I'm the friend  it wasn't try  a fort  I think the word fort  that makes him  tree fort  it's a tree fortress  like a deck  or a house  it's a fortress  fortress tree  it's a sexual fortress  it's crazy  yeah  it's like  a fucking drawbridge  that reminds me  Al Lou Bell  had a story  something similar  about a roommate  in college  Al Lou Bell  yes  years ago  Al Lou Bell  did a one man show  and it was in the  Al Lou Bell's a comic 
[02:44:30]  who was on  the Tonight Show  with Carson  he's been around  he's a good writer  he's talking about  25 lettermans  I definitely know  who he's in  and I went to see  his one man show  I think with  Louis Schaefer  Dan Natterman  a couple comics  and it was in this  little space  above stand up  New York  it's like  kind of a little  black box type  theater or whatever  it's like 50 seats  so we go to see  Al's show  Al does like  a two hour  sprawling  some of his stand up  telling stories  it's like two hours  probably a little  even longer than that  and we're just 
[02:45:00]  sitting in this  like shows  keeps going  the show ends  and we go up to Al  it's like three or four comics  and he's packing his bag  nobody says anything  and then  Natterman goes  monstrously long show  Al  holy shit  that was his first  brutal  that was his first  the first words uttered  and there were  it was  and Natterman has like  a 40s  he sounds like a guy  from the 40s  that's kind of great  do you know  I did a short film  with Lewis Black  called Side Splitters  do you know  that that character 
[02:45:30]  I do  oh boy  we're finally  going to be alone  with Hillary  I was mimicking  Natterman  that was how  yes  I had to play  Guadalphile Comedians  and that was  the Natterman impression  that I did  and it wound up  you know  just becoming  the way I did  that  I don't mean to act  like I was in a huge film  were you in  Spider-Man  or Spider-Man 2  which one of those  the linchpin  of the film  people considered me  I did  yes I had one line  in Spider-Man  I love that  there's nothing better  I think my favorite thing  about being in showbiz  at all  is just getting surprised  by seeing one of your friends  yeah on TV  totally takes you out 
[02:46:00]  it's like Spider-Man  suspension of disbelief  and then Norton's on the street  I'm like  thanks and I don't like him  oh wait it's Jimmy Norton  but the fun part is  because he does real  Dimitri's really  what was the Woodstock movie  you did with the star  oh yeah  taking Woodstock  I had to make out  with a guy in that movie  I have no acting training  oh fuck  and my first  kind of real role  I had to make out  with a guy  I remember that  you should have asked  in front of everybody  alright what do I do  if I get a hard on  how was that  from these 60's pants  I had to do 8 takes  Jesus  I was thinking  going into it 
[02:46:30]  I was just thinking  oh god alright  I'll just try to be a pro  I was thinking of multiple takes  now you're trying harder each time  oh no no  what do I have to do  to stop doing this  it's just weird  because you know what  you just feel like  gay  yeah  you just feel like  it just feels like medical  or like technical  it doesn't feel like sexual  I didn't see the film  was it a sexy scene  or were you guys  supposed to be like  fucking high  I'll tell you  there were two scenes  I had  one was  that was like  on a dance floor 
[02:47:00]  at a party  in a bar  so it was just  everyone starts cheering  because I kissed this guy  and it's like  I'm finding myself  and stuff  but I was supposed  to be in love  with the guy  it's a guy I met earlier  that I have a crush on  so that's what was hard  because I've seen friends  you know  they do  like on SNL  or something  they kiss  and everyone cheers  or laughs  but I had to like  it was Ang Lee  so I had to try to be  like emotional  or something  but the other scene  was with Jeffrey Dean Morgan  you guys know  I mean  he was in Watchmen  and I guess  Grey's Anatomy  and stuff  I don't know  that was like  this other storyline 
[02:47:30]  where I'm having  an affair with that guy  and we had to have  a love scene  and I had to be  the catcher  oh no  so then we shoot it  oh no  and the movie  comes out  and it's not in the movie  so I have this weird mix  I'm like kind of relieved  because like  you know what  that's kind of cool  I don't have to have that  out there  and then at the same time  I'm like  man I did that  I want credit for that  yeah  that's fucking  you know what  a lot of guys won't do it  like Will Smith  I heard wouldn't do it  in Six Degrees of Separation  they wanted him to kiss 
[02:48:00]  yeah  I respect the fact  that you did it  as an actor  I mean if they said  you had to do it  yeah it was interesting  it's like  I always joke around  like when you're a kid  somebody comes out  of a time machine  and tells you stuff  that you actually  end up doing  you know  playing kickball  they'll be like  is Demetri here  I'm like yeah that's me  listen when you grow up  you're going to make out  with a man  it's going to be on screens  all the way  yeah gotta go  whoa whoa what  wait a minute  did you tongue kiss him  no  but you know what  he made us open our mouths  I think after like  two or three takes  he's like you've got to  open your mouth guys  this doesn't look real 
[02:48:30]  a little turned on  by the thing  yeah I don't know  what the deal was  Sean Penn had to do it  in when he played  Harvey Milk  I mean  after a while  it becomes like this thing  that's like well  let's fuck it  are you a real actor  or are you not a real actor  well I watched that  when I was watching  The Warrior last night  and watching Omar  oh Michael K  I heard that's the best show  best show  yeah yeah  he gives kisses  like where he'll hold  your face  it was really  sensitive  and this sociopath  is being all sensitive  with his soon to be 
[02:49:00]  splayed open boyfriend  come here baby boy  it's interesting  because you know  there's a line between  just like you're being  straight up homophobic  and then it's just  biological stuff  where you're like  you know I'm just  uncomfortable  I'm not saying  I'm against gay people  I just you know  it's not my biology  yeah yeah  yeah  exactly  and it's more like  we've talked about it before  you get  and I don't know  how many times  somebody's popped up  some porno  on the computer  and two guys  are just viciously  going at each other  sexually  and you look  and you're kind of like  whatever  and then two guys 
[02:49:30]  kissing and making out  you're just like  oh Jesus  come on  I don't want to see that  it's the tenderness  and the lovingness  that makes you  kind of go like  as a guy  you know  kind of  back up a little bit  like what you  basically have to say  is he understands  the attraction  to holding a dick  in his mouth  fair like a shotgun  thank god  someone understands  but it's like  I don't want to  love the guy after  you can take this shotgun  but you're right  it's not homophobia  it gets to be  like a biological thing 
[02:50:00]  I'm not against it  I don't care  people get married  totally  I don't care  about any of that stuff  and it's so funny  how much of the conservative  it always comes out  the guys who rant  the most against it  of course they are gay  and they're afraid  they don't want anybody  to know  great documentary  on HBO  what do you have  hardcore gay porn  radio is in such  a weird place  just because of technology  people have screens  and you can talk  about stuff  bam there it is  and there it is  there's two bearded men  there's a lot of choice  he just scrolled through 
[02:50:30]  there was stuff  that wasn't the right  kind of gay  now that's the right gay  you gotta get  the proper one  the passion  you need the right gay  the facial hair  adds a little extra to it  you wanna see beard rubbing  that's one of my favorite videos ever  that's fucking horrible  beard rubbing is just  beard rubbing rules  wow  it's just like wow  the picture Danny showed  it was two guys with beards  and one was holding  the head of the other one  not unlike  the way Anderson Silva  was holding my neck  and that was like a really  passionate couple of men 
[02:51:00]  lip locking  rather unpleasant  to look at  rather unpleasant  and I've taken the plunge  in my life  what am I kidding  Norton man  I remember at Luna  you've told such great stories  I think I only went on there  one time  really  so I happened to be there  that night  that was amazing  that was so good  people went crazy  that was awesome  yeah it might have been  the tranny fucking story  I'm not sure  oh yeah  that's what it was  but it's also  it's not just the content  of the story  it's like  it was such a good reveal  like you just told it well  you know what I mean  that's the thing  I think once you've done  comedy a while 
[02:51:30]  you get a sense of  even if you've never  told the story before  you just trust yourself  you just know like  I think I know  where they're going to be laughs  like I think I know  how to tell this  there is a confidence level though  and I think the best  I've ever seen is Brewer  Brewer literally  he came in here  he told that pizza man story  for an hour  wow  Brewer can fucking tell a story  he can captivate  and the confidence  it's an hour  and he knew he was going to kill  lots of laughs  throughout the whole story  yes  thank you Roland  Dimitri's doing a signing  I'm guessing it's tonight  Union Square 
[02:52:00]  which is the big Barnes & Noble  it's a great place  for a signing  because there's a lot  you're not going to be outdoors  you're going to be inside  the whole time  even if it's raining  it's 7 o'clock  there will be a fucking  a lot of people there  for Dimitri  so if you want to go meet him  go down to Union Square  and buy a copy of  this is a book  and I know  I like the way  it's written  it's these little short pieces  and random thoughts  because there's no pressure  to marry yourself  god am I talking a lot  there's no pressure  to marry yourself  to one thought  how was it for your book 
[02:52:30]  how was it for writing  and then doing signings  loved it  fucking signings were the best part  because the people  it's just great to see  all these people  this is your first  to see all these people  holding what you've written  you really feel like  that's a tangible thing  I wrote a book  it's a fucking great feeling  are you writing more books  are you going to do that again  I have a third one  I want to do  you've done two  I did two  I took a break  it's crazy  it's a monster  you're a real author  it's like certain things  don't translate to stand up  and that's the beauty of it  you can kind of meander  when you're writing  by the way 
[02:53:00]  are you doing any signings  in Jersey  are you doing Ridgewood  no they don't have me  I think I was going to be  Montclair  but it didn't work out  so this is the closest I get  but maybe I'll get to do  more dates or something  because I'm from Jersey  so I should  you should do them  and to get on the list  you've got to do  a couple of independent  bookstores  as you know  so definitely try to get them  there's going to be  a massive fucking line  for Dimitri  he's a famous dude  and I'm happy for him  slash I hate him  it's like Kevin Hart  did fucking  what did he do  the Prudential Center  this weekend  is that right  yeah  I was at Montreal with him 
[02:53:30]  we were like new faces  at the same time  were you really  yeah  2001  it's all right  10 years  it's also funny  it's like so up and down  I think the funniest thing  is the guys who  act like they've arrived  or  it's like yeah  for a week  I remember  not to throw the guy  under the bus  I haven't seen the guy  in years  it doesn't matter  but Todd Lynn  oh yes  I remember I coming  to the Boston Comedy Club  one night  this guy's got a fur coat  did he really  yeah  because I heard he had  a holding deal  guy had a holding deal  they give you some money 
[02:54:00]  you know what I mean  even we've had a holding deal  yeah it's like  it's an advance  against something  whatever  to do nothing  I heard he got a car  and a fur coat  and I'm just like  what are you  he thought the show  was gonna  it's like I've arrived  I've made it  for me I'm just like  always like alright cool  so I got a little spike up  and then I go back down  and a little more up  and then go back down  how long was your show  on Comedy Central  two seasons  are you still on  or are you used to two  no it's canceled  was it canceled  because a lot of times  they don't do  and again I should  follow this more  yeah  but a lot of times  they don't promote right  like and Sarah 
[02:54:30]  I thought had a very funny show  yeah  and that only lasted  for three seasons  sometimes  I don't know  if they promote  was it too smart  no  it seems like  some of that smart stuff  unfortunately goes away  yeah for me  what it seems like  from my experience is  it's such a big country  right  300 million people  whatever  if  the way the media landscape  is now  is if a channel  has a kind of a brand  that you can understand  then you can click  onto that channel  at any time  you might be  motivated to go to it  because you get  what they do  and with Comedy Central 
[02:55:00]  it's really weird  that you have  The Daily Show  and Colbert  but you also have  Crank Yankers  and I don't know  I mean that was a while ago  right  but it's all over the place  and there's no regular season  really for anything  so the shows that do  the best  it seems  are the ones  that are on so much  like now Tosh  that people get  they're like  okay I know that's there  but if you have anything  that you produce  that requires big gaps  between it being on television  there's no  there's no way to know easily  is this new  when's the season on 
[02:55:30]  is this old  so I think both for Sarah  for me  for a lot of the shows  that are like  six or eight episodes  the two problems  seem to be  one  the tone's all over the place  for that network  you know what I mean  there's not like a consistent brand  they don't have a mission statement  it's not like  comedy for college kids  or like  a little weird  like just have some thing  there's nothing  it's like all over the place  I like that point  I think you described it perfectly  you were proud  with what you did  with your show right  yeah  I learned like hard lessons  I outsmarted myself  I was thinking  oh yeah 
[02:56:00]  you were allowed to do  everything you wanted to  I could do everything I wanted  and I just made it too hard  it's like  every sketch required  its own location  I was a producer  so I learned about like  where are we going to  park the trucks  wrote a sketch  with an old lady  she's got to be in the union  now I only have two old ladies  to choose from  because you know  it's like  stuff like that  in your head  and that's what's cool  about a book right  is that  I'm sure for you too Jim  it's like  you just write the idea  you don't have to worry  about producing it  you know  if I write a thing  with a robot  it's not going to be funny  with the robot  I can afford  you know what I mean  so yeah 
[02:56:30]  it was like a lot of that stuff  but I made it so hard  in those 20 minutes  I had for every episode  I just tried to squeeze in  as much as I could  I was working like  80 hours a week  and I'm thinking  I just don't want it that bad  I don't want to be  I only want to be famous  as much as it's required  to get people to come see me  do stand up  do you know what I mean  I think some people  really are in it  for the trip of like  man I want to be recognized  and when I go to a restaurant  I want people to look at me  and I remember Ornie  saying that  in that Seinfeld documentary  yes  I'm thinking  oh really  that's what you  really  oh man  because I just want crowds  that don't suck 
[02:57:00]  I just want like  a nice audience  so I can try my little jokes  about rowboats  or whatever stuff  I was thinking about  so your passion  is still stand up  yeah  what if you become  a big movie star  that'd be cool  if that gets people  into theaters  and also you know what  I want to have a family  I want to have kids  and stuff someday  so stand up is  it's hard  I can't live in one city  and just  I hear stories about the 80s  where comics in New York  oh yeah  you could live in New York  and you could go  from like club to club  and like you make  your living in New York  as a comic  but it's not like that anymore 
[02:57:30]  just eking out a living  playing  10, 15 clubs a night  yeah  what is that  yeah exactly  and even there  at least they could  piece it together  and now it's like  it's just not like that  you know what I mean  I mean I guess  you always had to travel  but even more so now  oh Hayden Panettieri  I'm sorry we're getting ready  as we're doing this  I got Jack  I got to go do Jack  for the Boneyard now  because we have  I have him early  no you can't  I have to  because I have a plane to catch  we're pretty much wrapping up  anyway  oh we're done  okay  I want a picture  Hayden Panettieri  where is she?  go get her  she's right there 
[02:58:00]  in the glass  well then go get her  where is she?  bring her in  bring her in for a second  no they'd never  we'd get in so much  fucking trouble  you know how that works  there she goes  now she just ran away  she's alright  in her book  Dimitri good seeing you buddy  it's good to see you man  alright why don't we  get the plugs in then  let Dimitri get out of here too  Dimitri Martin's book tonight  is at 7 o'clock  signing Union Square  Barnes & Noble  it's called  This is a Book  you guys know Dimitri's hilarious  there'll be a fucking line
