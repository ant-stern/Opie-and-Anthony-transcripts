<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Anthony, alongside Rich Voss (filling in for a sick James Norton and other absent crew), engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar humor, calling themselves "rabid radio retards" and joking about past controversies.  The conversation quickly shifted to the illness sweeping through the crew, speculating about food poisoning and making jokes about bad Chinese food. This led to a discussion of Voss's failed attempt to quit smoking and accusations of him sneaking cigarettes in the bathroom.  The show then veered into a discussion of a large Brooklyn warehouse fire, with speculation about arson and insurance fraud, prompting Voss to confess to starting a small fire as a child.  This opened the floodgates for callers to share their own childhood fire-related experiences, including accidental and intentional acts, one caller even admitting to burning down a church. The segment continued with more listener calls, fire anecdotes, off-color jokes, and the proposal of a "Yo Mama" joke segment in a cemetery for Mother's Day. They also discussed their return to terrestrial radio after a four-year absence, and their plans for future content, including live broadcasts during their walks and street performances by Voss.

The next segment focused on promoting "Whip-em-Out Wednesday" stickers, a discussion of a listener's "no homo" coworker, and detailed planning of a "Yo Mama" showdown between Bill Burr (via phone), Rich Voss, and Patrice O'Neal in a cemetery around Mother's Day.  A significant portion was dedicated to an *American Idol* elimination bet.  In-studio guests included Rich Voss, Sonny Ferrelli, and "No Filter" Paul.  Listener calls featured various anecdotes, including a "no homo" game at an all-boys boarding school and a description of shaking a midget's hand, compared to "a muffin and cocktail Franks."  The segment culminated in Ferrelli's prank of making Paul drink Fleet Phospho Soda, which he partially consumed.

The following segment centered on the effects of the Fleet Phospho Soda on Paul.  Callers, including Big Kev, shared their own experiences with the laxative, emphasizing its potency.  The segment was filled with crude humor about Paul's impending bowel movements, a running gag about "not trusting the fart," and jokes about the potential mess.  Paul was encouraged to do jumping jacks, then made to wear a diaper and walk outside the studio. Rich Voss performed an impromptu set at a Starbucks during this walk, with descriptions of the public's reactions. The show also briefly touched upon a news story about a Somali teenager executing his father's killer.  Back in the studio, the focus returned to Paul's bowel movements (or the lack thereof), with more vulgar jokes and speculation about the smell.  Numerous callers, including John from New Jersey, Anthony from New York, Carrie, Ed from New Jersey, Doc Martin, Sam from Buffalo, Kinsey from Tennessee, and others, participated.  Club Soda Kenny was also present both in-studio and during the outdoor segment with Rich Voss.

The next segment focused on the challenge for Paul to defecate in the studio. Opie, Anthony, Sonny Farrelly, and Bill repeatedly urged him, offering incentives and threats.  After much banter, Paul defecated in his diaper, eliciting visceral reactions from the hosts and guests. The cleanup and the smell were extensively discussed, with many listener calls reacting to the event.  NASCAR driver Jimmy Johnson called in, and the hosts discussed his career, sponsorships, and rivalries, interspersed with more listener calls and discussion of Paul's actions.

The show featured a lengthy, highly offensive phone call with a homeless woman, "Lady Di,"  discussing her homelessness, substance abuse, and alleged sexual encounters. The hosts aggressively questioned her, making numerous crude insults. Lady Di revealed she was 44, had recently celebrated her birthday, and was trying to get help for her substance abuse through SAI.  The conversation shifted to May Day immigration protests with in-studio guest Joey Diaz, who also promoted his shows.  The segment returned to further insults and ridicule of Lady Di, discussing a planned "mousetrap" bit and ending with an ice cream cake thrown at Paul, creating a mess. E-Rock then took over, playing listener-requested segments like "Butt Plug" and "Drill There," with several more brief caller interactions.

The broadcast concluded with a brief, curt dismissal of someone named Derek, without further context.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Good morning, good job there.  So what am I going to do?  Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around poking grudges with people.  You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well.  I just wish you well.  Wish you well.  Wish you well.  Touch the butt!  Touch the butt!  Touch the butt!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  We're rabid radio retards. 
[00:00:30]  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben! 
[00:01:00]  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We care like Chuck.  No!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian F.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the roll.  Boom, boom, boom.  Hi.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony program.  How is everybody?  Doing good.  The ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio and also CBS Radio. 
[00:02:00]  We're only a few shows into this comeback on regular radio.  Yeah.  People hearing us for the first time in four years.  To me that seems very, very crazy, but what's up?  I think we're technically a week in, right?  Yeah, we're a week in.  Week one.  Done.  We started this comeback, if you will, with Anthony Sick.  Then he passed it on to me.  And now today, a little Jimmy Norton is homesick. 
[00:02:30]  But he's a faggot.  He doesn't come in.  But he doesn't have the cold thing that we have.  I don't know.  Where's Ben?  He called Ben this morning.  I think he has food poisoning.  I think he might have old gravy leg.  Yeah.  He's puking and from both ends.  You do.  You better hit the beat.  Puking from both ends, as they say.  He got food poisoning.  He says he ate bad Chinese food. 
[00:03:00]  Why does everyone use the excuse they had bad Chinese food to take a day off?  You know, the Chinese people are really getting a bad rap in this country.  Because there's always bad Chinese food.  You never hear, I got food poisoning.  I had a bad burger yesterday.  It's always bad Chinese food, right?  I went to Morton's.  I had some filet mignon.  Oh!  Did I get food poisoning?  It's either Chinese food or bad sushi.  What did you get?  Because people will believe bad sushi.  They'll believe bad Chinese food.  Yeah.  But, oh yeah, I had bad pasta. 
[00:03:30]  No, you didn't.  Bad pasta.  Has anyone gotten food poisoning off of pasta?  I don't think so.  So, this is good news, though.  Instead of little Jimmy Norton, we got Rich Voss sitting in today on the third mic.  It's good to be here.  I feel the ghost of unfunny in this room, but...  Is that it?  You know, it's funny that Norton would say he got sick from Chinese food.  He would mix up food with a man, you know?  He got sick from Chinese food.  Please.  I know.  Everything he's done.  Everything he's confessed to. 
[00:04:00]  Where he's put his mouth.  You know?  Well, that might be what he means by bad Chinese food.  Oh, it was a hooker.  He's calling the hooker food.  Right.  That's his code word.  Code word for the disgusting things he does to the Chinese hooker.  You know, you say that they have a bad rap, but there's always, like, a new disease coming  from China every week.  It's like, you know, SARS, crusty elbow, you know, bird, birds, you know?  Bird flu.  I know.  You eat them.  You don't sleep with them, okay? 
[00:04:30]  Very dangerous.  Did you say SARS?  Yeah.  Track 12, please.  This will kill two minutes as we get the show together today.  OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF.  Sick with the SARS.  I cough and I wheeze. 
[00:05:00]  That incurable illness.  Thank the Chinese for SARS  Infected with SARS  I cop them in pain  I must have caught it from that chink on the plane  With SARS 
[00:05:30]  Sickened by SARS  And it really shows  My right lung exploded  And blew out of my nose  It's SARS  Chinese gave me SARS  I am very sick  Glad I'm not like them  With their really small height  And SARS  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program 
[00:06:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America  If you like what you're hearing  Tell a friend  That's how this whole thing will spread 
[00:06:30]  That's how it's always worked  The phone number  1-866-313-FREE  That's 1-866-313-FREE  During the break I was talking  I did a live read for  You know, quitting smoking  Yes  And then I ran into the bathroom  To take a leak  And all I smell is cigarette smoke  Jesus Christ  And there's only one person in studio  That I could blame  And that would be Rich Voss  Rich Voss  Sitting in for little Jimmy Norton 
[00:07:00]  And you may say  Ah, it doesn't matter  You know, there's a lot of people smoking out there  Yeah, we get that  But Rich Voss was on our show  What, last week?  Yeah  And you said you were going to quit Monday  Meaning a couple days ago  Well, here's what happened  Monday I went to the doctor  And he prescribed  Wellbutrin  To help me quit  And I took it a couple days  And I was going to have my last cigarette  In studio here at some point  And I'll even rip up the pack  Oh, so he turned it into some bit  I had to keep smoking  Well, I was looking out for you guys  For you guys 
[00:07:30]  So I could do it on the radio  Be a team player  And when were you going to tell us this?  You've been hanging out with us  For the last hour  You know, prepping for the show  Because I knew at some point  You went into that bathroom  And snuck a cigarette  Who are you kidding?  I didn't sneak it  I knew  Being that that's the only bathroom  That somebody would smell it  But here's the deal  I also bought my nicotine patch  I just need a doctor to call in  To find out how long  I can put my patch on  After I have my last cigarette  You know, I don't want to have the cigarette  Then put the patch on  And have too much nicotine in me, right? 
[00:08:00]  Nicotine in you from the cigarette  And then the patch  So I'll smoke my last cigarette  I'll even give away my $50 or $70 lighter  To whoever could use a lighter  For other things  You know, for starting  You could still use a lighter  Huh?  You could still use a nice lighter  I got a couple nice ones at home  But I don't need this one  I would give this to  You know, as a donation  To anybody that needs a lighter  You know, that might  You know, start a fire in their house  Or, you know, whatever  You could use a lighter for  Burn down a warehouse in Brooklyn  Whatever you need  Yeah, that was a hell of a fire  In Brooklyn, huh?  Still burning  It is still burning? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah  Unbelievable  It'll be a couple of days  Are they saying one of the biggest fires ever  In the New York City area?  Yeah, in the city  Unbelievable  Especially in Brooklyn  And then, yeah  Ten Alarm?  Yeah  Wow  Ten Alarm  They said it  It seems suspicious  These warehouses  They wanted them gone  So they could build on the property  There's been all kinds of problems  Getting rid of those buildings  But fire seems to do the trick every time  An accelerant might have been used  By the time the fire department got there  It was, like, fully involved 
[00:09:00]  So, yeah, a little suspicious  Well, the gas can outside of it  Yeah  It was a little tip-off  Usually  What amazes me about the fires is  Yeah, then the experts come in  And they find the match that was used  It was, like, how did you find a match?  It's like watching CSI  Yeah, it's like, oh, this fire obviously was set in the back room  And there's nothing left  I never got that  It's burnt  And don't worry  You don't have to call and explain  I personally just never understood that 
[00:09:30]  They see marks on the floors and the walls where accelerant was used  They could tell if gasoline or something else was used to start these fires  Yeah  They just paw through it  I could have been involved  I could have been involved in a house that  Where they just wanted the kitchen to burn  To get a little extra money  How do you just get one room in a house to burn?  Don't tell me  The whole house went  Of course  I didn't say I was  I said I could have been  You could have been  I could have been  I'm going to implicate yourself 
[00:10:00]  Once, you know, the door's closed and the addition is burning  But you don't realize once that door opens  Of course  I didn't say I was involved  But let me say when the fire could have been going  My golf clubs were thrown out the window  Before anything  How do you try to burn one room in a house?  How does that thought come to anyone's head  That I'm just going to burn the kitchen?  Don't you have to 
[00:10:30]  How do you keep the other parts of the house from burning  Until the fire department gets there?  You just hope  I don't know  I never did anything like that  Right, but if you would  Wouldn't you just hope they get there quick?  So that is the dumbest idea ever  Why did one room have to burn?  Don't you understand the wall to one room  Is the wall to another room  So if it burns  It's pretty much burning the other room  Well, yeah  Because I used to be a carpenter  I know the whole thing about walls connecting 
[00:11:00]  Yeah  Listen  I had nothing to do with this  Yeah  And I didn't plan it  Uh-huh  Okay  Were you there on site?  I heard about it  You heard about it  I heard about it  I heard about what you guys did  First hand?  Second hand?  I heard first hand  First hand  First hand  Because  No, I heard  No, I didn't do anything  Of course you didn't  I'm talking about the people you heard from  I heard from  Because I already moved out the day before  Uh  It happened 
[00:11:30]  Yeah  And why would one room want it to be burned?  I guess the person that was involved in this  Probably just wanted to collect insurance  To remodel the rest of the house  So you don't want the house to be a total loss  Yeah  But you want enough damage done  So you can get enough money  Yeah  That's a fine line  Using something as predictable as fire  Well  How many years ago was this?  Were you smoking crack at the time?  No  Yeah, you needed crack so bad 
[00:12:00]  That he decided to take this job on  25 years ago  I think the statute's over, my friend  I think you're alright  So no detectives will be banging on our studio today?  No, because I wasn't involved in it  Unsolved Mysteries  Needs your help  Catching Rich Voss  Too bad this isn't TV  Really?  That went up good  I guess you're miscalculated, huh?  What did these firebugs use as an accelerant? 
[00:12:30]  Well, what they did was  They would have had a guy  That falls asleep with cigarettes and stuff  That's real lazy  And a no-good Nick  Go to cook fries on the stove  Uh-huh  And had the oil burning  Didn't go back to his room  And by accident fall asleep  While the oil's burning  Oh, so the oil burns  And the stove  So the oil would catch onto the wall  That's what they said  Or I heard that they did  If they did it  Right, that's very dangerous  The whole place could go up  Oh my god 
[00:13:00]  All your clothes could have black soot on them and stuff  You know  But golf clubs  Once you get them out  You don't have to worry about them  And they're fine  So is that all that you recovered from this house?  That's all I owned  Your golf clubs  Then how much would someone get for this  If it was done properly?  Yeah, properly  I think they were going to get like 10 grand  But now they got  I think they got a lot  Because the whole house  The whole house went  But then you have nowhere to start  Now you need to buy a new house  Well, yeah 
[00:13:30]  It was a lot of extra work  That person wasn't planning  Right  To do  I heard  And let me tell you  I think I don't associate  With those type of people anymore  Yeah  I have a whole new type of friend  You cleaned yourself up  Yeah  This was a long, long time ago  This was almost 30 years ago  It's confess your crime  I'll fess up to starting a fire  Yeah?  Yeah  I was a little kid  I think I was in kindergarten  And it was out on Long Island, of course  And me and my brother were playing with matches 
[00:14:00]  My brother's about a year and a half older than me  And we went to this place  Where there was like a horse pasture  Across from a bunch of houses  And we're playing with matches  And we throw them down onto the dry grass  And watch it burn  And then stomp it out  And do it again  And let it get a little bigger  And then stomp it out  And then we lit one up  And my brother like held my foot  He wouldn't let me put it out  And I was like  It's getting pretty big  I'm a kindergartner  And I'm like  Joe, idiot  It's getting a little big here 
[00:14:30]  It's getting a little out of hand  And then he let go of my foot  And we both tried to stomp it out  And it was making that  Woof, woof  Sound under your feet  When you try to stomp it out  And just spreading it further  Right  Little kindergarten feet  Trying to put out a fire  Just wasn't working  So we ran to a house across the street  And just knocked on the door  Very calmly and said  And there's now a blaze right out  The person opens their door  Sees us to a backdrop 
[00:15:00]  Of a forest fire  And we're just two little kids going  Can we borrow your hose?  Like it's no problem  No issue  Everything's fine  We just need a hose  A first grader and a kindergartner  Can put out this blaze  Don't you worry about it  Just go inside  Nothing to see here  And after an oh my god  She called the fire department  Who came in  And we were too stupid  To run away  So it was like  You know 
[00:15:30]  The little rascals  The little firemen  Like picked me up  And asked me  What happened here  And in kindergarten  And this just goes to show you  The awful upbringing  I had at the time  I believe this was  Probably early 70s maybe  Late 60s kind of thing  And from the environment  I grew up in  With my parents at the time  I blamed it  On black people  I was in kindergarten  Dude I was in kindergarten 
[00:16:00]  And I turned to the fireman  And went  Two black guys  I saw two black guys  And this is in a neighborhood  On Long Island  Where you just did not see black people  This is the white  Lily white neighborhood  Northport you know  Out on Long Island  Back then especially  And in kindergarten  Because of  You know where do you get that  At six or seven years old  However old you are  In kindergarten  Six  Where do you get that 
[00:16:30]  Kind of like racism  From all the crime  In your classroom  Well that must have been it  I don't remember one black  I don't remember seeing  A black kid  Or a black person  By the time I was  In kindergarten  Yet I was pinning the blame  On there  Doing that fire  Did they go and round them up  Oh back then  Forget about it  They used the fire hoses  To put the fire out  And then  Brought them downtown  And  Used the hose again  German shepherds  And the fire hoses  Came out again  God 
[00:17:00]  I don't know what happened  I might have gotten  Some people in trouble  But  Man that is really funny  About the same age  Me and my two brothers  The same exact  I'm almost the exact same story  Your kids are fascinated  With fire  That's why you gotta tell them  Time and again  Stop playing with magic  It's just  It's a hypnotic  Right  Fun thing to do  When you're a kid  Grew up in  Centiport  We had a lot of woods  Behind the house  And same thing  We were playing  Army soldiers in the woods  Yeah  And that was fun  For like  You know  20 minutes  And like 
[00:17:30]  Well how do we make  This more exciting  Of course  Napalm  Of course  Matches makes  Everything more exciting  When you're a kid  When you're a kid  Sure  And we did the same thing  We're just starting  Little fires  Just little ones  Like we're even being  Safe at the time  And like you know  Pushing all the leaves  Out of the way  So we just had  One tiny  I mean as big as your fist  Pile of leaves  Yeah it's safe  And then you know  Dirt all around the area  So we would burn that  And have the  Have little you know  Soldier fights around the fire  So almost like a little  Campfire setting  And then that got boring  So then we wanted  To make a bigger one  A bigger one 
[00:18:00]  So you always want  A bigger blaze  And pretty much  Same way your story ended  The fire got too big for us  And we were like  Kindergarten age ourselves  Seven, eight, nine tops  And Augusta went  That's all it takes  Just like that  That's all it was  And the fire spread  To a huge pile of leaves  Now we're little kids  In just white t-shirts  And cut off jean shorts  And sneakers  And now we're trying  To stomp out the fire  Yeah  And our sneakers are melting  They're melting 
[00:18:30]  Yeah your sneakers melt  And you just hear that  Sound of flames  Shooting out from under your feet  But we were troopers  We didn't want to give up  On the firefighting  And we continued  And continued  As the fire was spreading  All the way up the hill  On the trees  On the bushes  Heading toward the house  At the top of the hill  Once you see  Trees go up  Yeah you're horrified  It was the middle of summer  And there was no rain  For a really long time  So everything was really dry  So this fire spread  Really fast  I mean really fast  Centiport Fire Department 
[00:19:00]  Was called  Other fire departments  Were called  There were fire trucks  Everywhere  They had to put out  The whole back  Of the woods there  Leading up to the  House on the hill there  Yeah  And finally  They put the fire out  It's smoldering  Right  A couple firefighters  Up there  Just putting out  Little little fires  You know  They're shovels  And they line us up  It's the fire department  It's the police  And they're looking at us  And all three of us  We're just like  We got soot  All over our bodies  All over our bodies  Because we were  We were fighting hard 
[00:19:30]  For a long time  And they're like  Alright what started the fire  You know who started the fire  And stupid me  Because I just learned  You know  Fire safety  I go  Officer  I noticed that there were  Some oily rags  In the woods  Spontaneous combustion  I blamed it on  You blamed spontaneous combustion  I blamed it on oily rags  Because I remember that day  Or a couple days earlier  In stupid school  That you know  You shouldn't have oily rags  Laying around in your garage  It could cause a fire  In like a bucket 
[00:20:00]  Or some closed place  But I thought  I thought I was being smart  They saw right through it  Our excuse obviously  And we were grounded  For the entire summer  Oh  And if you know  My house that I grew up in  You know  It has a really big driveway  And then all these woods  Man it's perfect for a kid  We had tree forts  And all sorts of stuff up there  The whole summer  You know  Had to just stare at the woods  And you know  We couldn't go up there  You sure the firemen  Didn't say  Well there's some black kids  Out here starting fires  Yeah we had reports  We had reports in this area

[00:26:00]  And we made a comment  In the back office  Yeah cause some guy  Another shooting  In New York  In Harlem  Some guy apparently  Parked in his car  On the side of the road  And he was shot to death  And I was going to Anthony  Who just parks their car  And sits in it  In Harlem  Now I know  Unless you're up  To no good  Renaissance going on  Up there  And this whole  Rebirth of Harlem  And they're rebuilding  And people are actually  Going up there  It's a tourist attraction  Go see the Apollo Theater  The rebuilding  To shop  But let me tell you 
[00:26:30]  I'll check it out  In another 10 years  Once the lights go out  It's still  A little shady  And there's some areas  That you don't go in  In the daytime  Or anything  And you never  Stop your car  I've driven through  At night  Places like that  Flatbush  Brooklyn  Places like that  You don't stop  Lights  Are just  They're optional  A suggestion  At the most  If you're white  The lights are optional  When you're above  110th Street  Here in Manhattan  And you won't get a ticket 
[00:27:00]  Believe me  You won't get  If you just blow through  Lights in certain neighborhoods  The cops will not pull you over  And ticket you  You can just go through  Red lights  They blow through the lights  Yeah  You know  We used to go up to Harlem  All the time  To cop  And I was getting out  Of the car once  This is true  When some guy was chasing  Another guy with a butcher knife  My friends were going  Get in the car  I go  He's not after me  I don't care  Right  And it was just  It was a scene up there  That  If you  If you just  Like certain people  Were dead 
[00:27:30]  You know  They would just take  You know  Just take  Everything from you  Just take  You know  But I'm sure that happens  In you know  Like the suburbs  Like Princeton  And stuff like that  You know  Occasionally you do read something  Every once in a while  Let's go to Chano  It looks like  Chano  Long Island  What's up  Hey what's going on  Yeah a couple years ago  I mean a couple of my boys  We went up to Yankee Stadium  To go to a baseball game  So  You know  We had the  You know  Hibachi  Going everything  Ponding down some beers  For a Yankee game 
[00:28:00]  And all of a sudden  We're out in the field  You know  Up in the bleachers  And we're looking  And we're in there  And they're announcing  Some trucks on fire  We're laughing  What a jerk  Who would do that  Turned on my buddy  And it's this truck  He used to say  We had to take a train  Back home  Back to the aisle  Oh it was your buddy's  Truck on fire  Oh it was the funniest  Stuff ever  Man just watching  That thing  Boys  And here we are  Thinking  What kind of retard  We do that  Yeah  Nothing scarier  When it's your car  On fire  I've owned  Some crappy cars 
[00:28:30]  In my day  And had my share  Of engine fires  And they are  Just the worst  Because you know  You depend on your car  I had a Volkswagen  Beetle  Beetle  That I had turned  Into what is called  A Baja Bug  I lived in California  For a while  So I kind of got  Into this whole  Dune buggy  Baja bug thing  Fiberglass  Little body parts  That go on  And make it  Off road  So you can  Drive it through  The woods  And stuff  And this thing  Was a constant  Problem starting  And I used to  Have to prime  The carburetor 
[00:29:00]  With gasoline  So I just  Pour gasoline  Into the carb  And start it up  So I start it up  One night  And I look  In my rear view  Mirror  And I see  A crackling fire  It looked real nice  Out the back window  Until I realized  It was my engine  Completely engulfed  In flames  While you were  Driving it  Yeah  I'm driving  And I'm just  Thinking  I can't still  Be driving  If my engine  Is on fire  It can't be that  It must be a  Flickering taillight  Or something  So I drove  A little further  Until I started 
[00:29:30]  Hearing some  Popping  And then got out  And that was it  Once you stop it  And the wind  Kind of keeps  The fire off  The fiberglass  And then  Engulfed  We were  My friend's  Brother lent him  His car  You know  You know  When your older  Brother lends you  The car  Do not mess up  His car  Of course not  We pulled over  Somewhere  Then we're driving  Away and the leaves  Under the car  Got caught  And the sparks  Whatever  Caught the leaves  On fire  And we're driving  We go 
[00:30:00]  Do you smell smoke  And the whole car  Gets in the car  And my friend's crying  Crying  That's bad man  You know  With like  A 19 year old  Crying  That's embarrassing  Were you laughing  At him  He's crying  In his flaming car  And you're laughing  That's terrible  Let's go to

[00:34:00]  In my driveway  Reading the newspaper  Looking for a job  I just bought this  Little Honda  And my mom calls me in  So I take the newspaper  I throw it on the dashboard  It was hot  It was sunny out  I throw my glasses  On top of the newspaper  I go inside  I'm eating  My mother looks out  The window  She goes  My god  Your car's on fire  The god damn sun  Went through the sunglasses  It was like a magnifying glass  You have a burning  Ants up  Jeez  Yeah  And catches the newspaper  On fire  I run outside  We put the fire out  But for like a year and a half  I drove that car around  With no dashboard  All melted  Melting plastic

[00:35:30]  It hits the grass  In the backyard  And the whole backyard  Goes up with flames  What did he expect  He's using a flamethrower  That's not a super soaker  At that point  It's turned into  A flamethrower  Let me tell you something  It worked pretty good too  I gotta tell you  This show is very sexy  For all the pyros out there  Pyros all over the place  Are whacking it  People love fire  Just like  Get hypnotized by it  Everybody said  It's fine  I had to guess  Everybody had that one friend

[00:50:30]  A comedy club  Just say  Yeah  Let's say  Things don't go as well  As you expect them  In a Starbucks  Or on the street  We told you to  Break out your  Hacky stuff for Starbucks  That's everything I have  And the best part  We got Club Soda Kenny  We're not even  Going to set up the bit  We're just going to  Club Soda Kenny  Is going to walk in  With a mic  And just go  Your next comic  Coming to the stage  You might remember him  From last comic standing  It's Rich Voss  And then you're just  Going to walk in  And be a thank you  Thank you  And just  You got big  You got big balls 
[00:51:00]  I think  I think Kenny  Also ought to say  Come on  Let's hear it for them  People  Right  Because they're not  Going to clap  You must force them  To clap  I will give the big  Intro that Mr. Voss  Deserves  Yes  Very good  And the patrons  Of Starbucks  That's how my career  Went  From last comic standing  It started at  Like this is how  It's gone in the last  Couple years  Like you were great  On last comic standing  Then a little bit  Down the road  You're that comedian  Then after that  Now it's like  Where do I know you from 
[00:51:30]  You know  It just slowly  And then it's  Starbucks  At nine in the morning  You know  Fame is a really weird thing  Because that exact thing  Happened to us  After the Sex for Sam thing  Yeah  I mean when we  Blew up our careers  It pretty much  Couldn't go any bigger  For us  We were on top  Of the radio world  And you couldn't  Even walk the streets  Without people recognizing it  And stuff  Then we blew it up  With the Sex for Sam  And then  Then you couldn't even  Leave your house  For a while  And then  You know  A mere two years later  We're walking around now 
[00:52:00]  And no one remembers  Or cares  No one recognized  No one recognized  No one saying  Hey what have you been up to  You're just done  Fame stinks  It really does  It's a roller coaster  Well that's why  You see all these celebrities  Where they have nothing going on  They try controversy  Or they had their publicist  You know  Hey he'll be eating lunch  At this  You know  Put out a sex tape  Yeah  With somebody  That's always a big one  For somebody  That's on the decline  But there are certain celebrities  That just never lose  Their celebrity  No matter what  Like how little 
[00:52:30]  They've done  Over time  Yeah  But they're still famous  They walk out  They're completely recognizable  People approach them  Ask them for autographs  What's his name  Goddamn  Was married to  Roseanne  Oh Tom Arnold  Tom Arnold  Is one of those guys  That will always be famous  No matter what  He doesn't do  That's because  She slept with Roseanne  Yeah but I mean  How much mileage  Does that give you  Well he was on 
[00:53:00]  Best Damn Sports Show  And he had a run  With some movies  With Arnold  He had one good movie  That he was ever in  True Lies  Ever  That was it  Every other movie  He was in  Stinkeroo  If I could use the harsh language  Like that  Awful  But famous forever  There you go  What's AK  Arkansas  Yes  Is AK Arkansas  I guess  Yeah alright  Bruce in Arkansas  What's up  Bruce 
[00:53:30]  Yeah I'm here  Let's go buddy  Hey man  Yeah  You guys forget  That it was  Whip-em-Out Wednesday  We did not forget  That it's Whip-em-Out Wednesday  You want to explain  To the brand new listeners  Out there Bruce  Absolutely  What you gotta do  You gotta send  A self-addressed  Stamped envelope  To 111 West 57th Street  In a couple of weeks  You'll get yourself  A fine WOW sticker  That stands for  Whip-em-Out Wednesday  Let me stop you there  Unfortunately  We're on a lot of  Terrestrial  Not unfortunately  We're on a lot of  I'll tell you why  It's unfortunate 
[00:54:00]  We're on a lot of  Terrestrial radio stations  They're all getting  Their own WOW stickers  Made  But right now  There are no WOW stickers  Made for the  Terrestrial radio stations  I guess  I saw some design  That Tom Chiasano  Showed us  It looks pretty cool  The one that's gonna be  All over New York  It basically says  O&A are back  And it's the call letters  And it says WOW  Nice  And Pittsburgh  Has their own version  And BCN  And all that  So I guess  Locally  The radio stations  Will promote it  On their own  How to get the WOW stickers  But yeah  If you want to get  One of the ones  We already have made 
[00:54:30]  You can do what  Bruce just said  Alright continue Bruce  Well upon displaying  This sticker on your vehicle  As you drive down the road  Ladies may be inclined  To see said sticker  And display their  I don't know  An appropriate word in there  So I don't blow up  Your spot guys  They're beautiful  Ta-tas  There you go  And then you can drive down the road  See some wonderful cleavage  Possibly a little more than cleavage  If you're lucky 
[00:55:00]  Yeah  And it enhances your day  And makes things a lot better for everybody  Makes the commute a lot easier  If you're driving  And all of a sudden  It's like fishing  Right  You just put the line out there  Some days you catch something  Some days you don't  You'll just be driving  You won't even think about it  And all of a sudden  You'll look over to your left  Or your right  And go  Why is she doing  Why is she  Oh yeah  Yeah  And until you  Sticker  And until you can get  The official WOW sticker  You can make the homemade Wows  And all that  We love the homemade WOW sign  A lot of truckers  Just scratch it in the dirt 
[00:55:30]  On the back of their trucks  It's also a great way  To support the Opie and Anthony program  And the ONA virus  Yeah  If you're not into the whole WOW thing  For what you know  Right  It stands for like that  Alright guys  I'm punching out  Alright man  We didn't care  We could have just hung up  He had to tell us he was leaving  Yeah we don't care  I'm leaving  Hope you guys can still do the show  You notice we're one of the only radio shows  That we don't say goodbye to you politely  We just hang up when you're done  Yeah  And then there's people on hold  If you notice like you've been on hold  For 20 minutes  And all of a sudden  You know  You're not on hold anymore  We just weren't interested 
[00:56:00]  In your phone call  Or we were moving on  We can't be polite  You know this show has to move like this  So we can't be polite  Also with the WOW thing  Just don't harass the ladies  We've been doing this for many many years  And we've had no problems whatsoever  You put the WOW on your car  If it happens  It happens  If it doesn't  And just you know  Move along  Don't worry about it  Okay  Were we on the Daily Show Monday?  Let's say hi to Pat in Texas  Pat what's up?  Yes boys you were  A photo of you guys  Was on the Daily Show Monday evening 
[00:56:30]  Really?  What was the gist?  This week in God segment  With Rob Corddry  Yes  Who you know  They have the God machine  And they do the  Right  I don't remember what the end game was  It was Opus Magistri or some shit  But I'm sorry  Uh oh  Sorry about that  You said a bad word  Yeah  They showed Opus from Doonesbury  And then they showed Opie and Anthony  And then they showed Opus of Magistri 
[00:57:00]  Or whatever the heck it was  Right  How about that?  Yeah not bad  Nice  Cool  Thought you would enjoy that  I definitely  I like that Daily Show  And the Colbert Report  Very funny  Let's go to Andy in Ohio  Andy  Hey good morning  Bo-bo-bo-bo-boy  What's up Andy?  Hey are we at  I thought we had a discussion yesterday  That we weren't trying to get fired  Did we quickly forget  Another holiday coming up  Another bit  Hey we've been on a week  We're allowed to go to a cemetery  And do your mama jokes 
[00:57:30]  Uh  We just happened to be doing it on Mother's Day  Just because the crowds are a lot larger  Hey yeah  Crowds will be a lot larger  You know comedians want to perform in front of large crowds  There's not going to be any  Not going to be telling them to the people that  The mourners  It's just going to be two guys  Kind of by two tombstones that aren't being used  Yeah  Aren't being tributed that day  Uh  Telling  Doing the Yo Mama  MTV does the Yo Mama thing  Is it MTV?  Yeah  They do Yo Mama  Why not take it to that setting 
[00:58:00]  Instead of that back alley setting  That's where it's really appropriate  I think it's more appropriate  A cemetery on Mother's Day  Than it is on the set they have on MTV  That's really taking it down  I wouldn't worry  We've learned our lesson for now  I think we're pretty good about knowing  What'll get us fired and what won't  We interrupt this program to bring you  The Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day  Wow who saw this coming? 
[00:58:30]  Tribute to midgets and a tribute to our pal in Boston Ozone  That's right  It's uh  No Homo  Hey how's it going?  You know what?  We have to explain No Homo to this part of the radio show  Like I said earlier  We're doing two radio shows  Two radio shows a day basically  On the second half of the show on XM Satellite Radio  We have one of these guys that works behind the scenes  And he does very very gay things to the other interns  And the other people that work behind the scenes  For the Opie and Anthony program  He says he's not gay or anything  And they're just fun things that he does with his friends 
[00:59:00]  Right  But he brought up a couple  And they seem a little off to me  One of them is taking his hand  And he'll come up behind you  And stick his hand right between your legs  Over your pants of course  And kind of rub up your butt  With his hand  Over your pants  My gym teacher used to do that to me  And he goes  Hey did you go in your pants?  Or something like that 
[00:59:30]  Or something to that effect  Yeah he's checking if anything's going on back there  Going on  And then of course like  You're in shock  Like what are you doing?  And just before you want to punch the kid in the face  He goes  No homo  He goes  Hey no homo  And then it's okay  And then it's okay  Because he said no homo  It's an excuse for this guy to do very gay things  He walks up to co-workers  And nuzzles their arm  And kisses their arm  In a very sensuous way  Or their neck  Neck shoulder  As they're talking to people  To you know embarrass them  And then he goes  No homo 
[01:00:00]  So if I'm  If I'm in a rest area  And I go  No homo  I can get away with it  If you're staring  There you go  At a small round hole  Cut in the side of a toilet stall  And there's some guy's lips there going  Psst  Fella  Psst  And you give him what he wants  Yeah  After you're done  No homo  You just say no homo  And you're fine apparently  Yeah  Do you guys ever do this  For real  Like with a girl  Uh oh  You know  Say your girlfriends  Or whatever  Like I  You ever watch gay porn

[01:02:30]  Yeah  That's what you're into  When they start kissing  That's when you don't want to watch it  Oh of course  Well that's  That's where you gotta draw the line  Snuggling  Cuddling  Spooning  That's fine  No none of that stuff  You just want hardcore  You know action  Not hardcore  You know  You know what I mean  You just want  Hardcore action  Not yeah but I mean  Just  And you watch this with your chick  Yeah  And what does this do  So it's no homo right  Yeah  You're not gay  Because you're just watching  Yeah  A different type of porn

[01:06:30]  Can't wait to see it Bill  Hey we got a bid idea  What's that  We have a bid idea  Oh okay  Uh we want you to do it  With uh Rich Voss  Well no and Patrice  If we can get  Possibly Patrice  But I was thinking Bill Burr  Uh you know how you did  The Your Mama thing  Bill  Yeah  With Big A and uh  Twitchells last Friday  Oh you mean that  Bits and Bombs  Yeah I remember that  Yeah but it was Bill's idea  To kind of bring  The Yo Mama concept  From MTV 
[01:07:00]  To the radio show  By having a couple of our  Uh characters  Yeah we  Uh do the Yo Mama bit  Yeah we would throw  Our own spin on it  Yeah  And it was an okay bid  Last Friday  It was alright  You know it didn't work out  As well as we had hoped  But uh  And Bill uh  Was kind of  Taking some heat  Because it was his idea  Right  But Bill I think  Uh you will be uh  Vindicated here  Yes  Uh because  We got another idea  For the same bit  And maybe you'll want  To be involved  You ready 
[01:07:30]  I'm sensing an ominous  Tone here  But yeah go ahead  Alright  Well you know that  Uh Mother's Day  Is right around the corner  Yes  Yeah I do  So that ties into  The Yo Mama thing  It makes it extra special  Being on Mother's Day  Would you be willing  To have a  Your Mama  Showdown  With Rich Voss  And Patrice O'Neal  For Mother's Day  On Mother's Day  A Yo Mother fight  Yeah it's like  A Yo Mama  Uh a battle  Like they do on  MTV 
[01:08:00]  On Mother's Day  Right  Uh yeah  Why do I feel like  I'm not getting  The whole story here  Well here's the twist Bill  We want you to do it  At a cemetery  Thanks for blowing it Bill  Thanks for blowing it  Once again  See Bill  See Bill  Bill you gotta listen  The location  Will be  A crowded cemetery  Because you know  On Mother's Day  A lot of people  Go to visit  Uh their tombstones  And how fun 
[01:08:30]  Would it be  To be blurting out  Yo Mama  Is so dead  Uh jokes  In a cemetery  While people are  You know bringing flowers  To their loved mother  I just have one question  About this bit  Is Paul McCurrio  Gonna be in it  Thank you  We're allowed  To do this  Yeah there's nothing  Illegal about this  We're not gonna be  Harassing anybody  No  It's just  You guys  At a cemetery  Mother's Day 
[01:09:00]  Is on a Sunday  You guys aren't even  On the air  We're taping it  For the radio  They have recorders now  We will tape it  You're sending me  To a cemetery  I don't like it  You don't like it  You don't like it  Bill  I think you're  Setting me up  For something  No that's the setup  It's pretty  Pretty effed up  What else could we  Possibly add in  Yeah the bit itself  We can push him  Into an open grave  When it's done  Yeah right  It's just that  You guys are doing  A whole your mama thing  At a cemetery  On Mother's Day  Or around Mother's Day 
[01:09:30]  We're hoping for  Mother's Day morning  Before we all have to  Go see our moms  Now I think the location  Will be in the cemetery  A couple of tombstones  Close together  But that no one  Is mourning at  Right  And then  But there are mourners  Around those tombstones  So they will kind of  Hear what's going on  Because like  You'd be pointing  At the tombstone  Going  Your mama  Is so skinny  You know  Fill in the funny  Jesus 
[01:10:00]  Bill what's wrong  What do you  You basically want me  To harass people  Who are visiting  Their dead mothers  No  You're not listening  Boy are you missing  The point  We gotta work  On your listening skills  You're not listening  People are depressed  In cemeteries  And you need a way  To cheer them up  It's gonna be  You guys are going at it  You guys are at the cemetery  Going at it  You're not  You're not going after  Anyone else but each other  You're not walking up 
[01:10:30]  To someone else's grave  Where there are people  Laying flowers  And pointing at them  Going your mama  Although that would really  Make the bit exciting  I was gonna say  Then where is the comedy  The comedy is  That you're  You're going back and forth  With another comic  But perhaps  Some of the mourners  Can hear you  Does he dissect  Every bit like this  Even though you're not  Directing it towards them  They will hear the comedy  And feel a little better  About their visit  Kind of sounds like  A visual bit on the radio 
[01:11:00]  I'll do it  Nah we need someone  That really wants to do it  Bill  He's like  I guess I'll do it  Well I already  Bombed with this concept  Before so you know  I'm a little gun shy  With this thing  Well that's why we tape it  If it sucks  Then we don't even  Throw it on the radio  And we just tell everyone  We did it and it was great  And it was fantastic  Right  You tell them everything  Was fine  If it doesn't work  We're in a cemetery  So it died  And it died in a cemetery  It was the big deal  Bury the bitch  Alright Bill  Hey Rich  Are your legs

[01:16:30]  A lot of  I don't know  We weren't really  In agreement  In the office  We were kind of  Discussing this  A little earlier  And we watched it  Last night  But I don't agree  With your picks  Paris is so gone  I don't see that happening  Paris is so gone  I don't see it happening  I think she's got  The entire  Black vote  So I think  She's going to  That'll put her  Over the top  Plus  The white people  That vote  Because she's  Good  She's kind of  Got a cute look 
[01:17:00]  To her and everything  But you can't vote  With a calling card  Of course you can  You can  It does  It can't tell  If the phone  You're texting from  Is stolen or not  So every vote counts  Oh okay  I think she'll do fine  I think it's between  Elliot  And  The other  Broad  McPhee  What's her name  Catherine McPhee  No way 
[01:17:30]  She was so  Bad last night  She  She just  Made an abortion  Out of the first  Song she did  They did two songs  Last night  She kind of  Recouped with the  Second one  Because it wasn't  As bad  But it was  It's an awful song  I don't care how  Popular it is  Or anything  Just awfulness  Chris  Is doing a great job  Chris Daughtry  Is going to win  The whole thing  I think he's going  To take the whole thing  But kicked off  Tomorrow  I have to say  It's between  Elliot  Or  McPhee  Nah Elliot 
[01:18:00]  Freaking  Paula Abdul  Crying last week  Put him over  Don't matter  Put him over  I don't think that matters  Hundred dollars  Elliot doesn't get  Voted off  Tonight  Well that's  Hundred dollars  I need odds  Huh  I need odds  I can't  I'm not just  Pick that  I need odds  I lose  I give you 25 bucks  You lose  You give me 100  Hundred dollars  Paris gets kicked off  Who's getting kicked off  There's only one  I said  Hundred dollars  That Elliot  Doesn't get kicked off  Oh okay  Hundred dollars  That Paris  Gets kicked off 
[01:18:30]  You can take  Both bets  One bet  What do you want to do  What do you want to do  Alright  Both bets  So  I'll take both bets  Elliot doesn't get kicked off  Elliot  So basically  If Paris gets kicked off  Tonight  I get $200 from you  Right  Okay  But I'm saying that  Elliot  Is getting kicked off  Tonight  Yeah  No way  I say Elliot gets kicked off  So wait  So if Elliot gets kicked off  I owe you  200  Yeah that's how it works  So you're basically saying 
[01:19:00]  Elliot gets kicked off  Can we break even anyway  In this stupid bet  We'll just go 100 then  Right  I say Paris  You say Elliot  This is a dumb way to bet  If it's a third person  Then it's no win  That's what we'll do  Elliot gets kicked off  I owe you $100  Paris gets kicked off  You owe me $100  I'm not absolutely sure  About Elliot  I think it could also be  McPhee there  Because she was horrible  I don't think Paris  Is going  I really don't 
[01:19:30]  I'll take  Alright  I'll take  I'll take that bet too  What?  I'll make it easy for you  There's your odds  I say Paris is getting  Kicked off for $100  What happened?  If Elliot or Catherine McPhee  Get kicked off  And not Paris  I'll give you $100  Who are you?  I know  This isn't Opie  We just signed  A really big contract  Who the hell is this?  I decided to live a little  Wow  Been on reality shows  You know what's interesting 
[01:20:00]  About the voting  For American Idol  One of three Americans  One of three  One of three American Idol  Viewers believe  A vote for Fox  Is widely popular  Talent search program  Counts at least as much  As voting for a president  Oh boy  According to a new survey  Basically people  Would rather vote  For who's  You know  Their favorite  American Idol  Than vote for our  Next president  Yeah because Taylor Hicks  Is going to get us  In a war  That's what's going to happen  That's important 
[01:20:30]  Plus in this country  You don't have to be legal  To vote for American Idol  That's true  35% of those polled  Felt that  They were making  Better use of their time  Voting for the next Grammy  Hopeful than  In a political election  There's something about  People who felt  Maybe their vote  In the last elections  Didn't count  But with American Idol  They're hoping to  Propel someone to stardom  So they think  It's more important  And that their vote counts  You're right  Speaking of which  USA Today  Before we move on 
[01:21:00]  They're doing a poll  Every week  And they're polling  Their readers  And asking  Who your favorite  American Idol is  You want to go  From the bottom  Up or from the top  Down  You read it  However you want  And then I'll tell you  Why that doesn't mean  Jack  Alright Paris Bennett  5% of the vote  5% of the vote  For Paris  Right  That's it  5% of the people  Like her the best  Okay  Taylor Hicks  16%  16%  Catherine McPhee  22%  Elliot Yameen  23% 
[01:21:30]  That's why  He's not  And his numbers  And his numbers  Went way up  After Paula Abdul  Started crying over  I'm telling you  She put him over  Alright  And then Chris Daughtry  At 28%  How about that  That's pretty accurate  No you know why  That doesn't mean anything  It's a poll  Of USA Today readers  How many 14 year old  Girls are going  Mom  Get me the USA Today  It's not based on  Who is really doing  A lot of the voting  There's a lot of  Kids voting 
[01:22:00]  A lot of people  That do not read  USA Today  A lot of younger people  Read USA Today  Because there's a lot  Of charts and pictures  Colorful pictures  Yeah  We're not talking  About the New York  Times here  I just see  Either Paris  Or Elliot  No not Paris  That other one  McPhee  Getting the boot  Tonight  Those are my two picks  You want to hear  Chris Daughtry  Doing Renegade  Going to break  Jesus Danny  Let's do some  I won't even read that 
[01:22:30]  What happened  Horrible racist  Alright we're going  To take a break  We'll go to break  With Chris Daughtry  From last night's  American Idol  Doing a great version  Of Styx  Renegade  Just a piece here  Check it out  Oh mama  I'm in fear  For my life  From the long  Arm of the law  Hey man  It's coming down  From the gallows  And I don't have  Very long  The chick is up

[01:25:30]  It was bad  For the first couple weeks  I love her honesty man  And then you know  Then I moved on  You got over it  And that's the reality  Of anything  Exactly  This is a chick  Having a relationship  She was a little  Broken up at first  We were gone  But after a while  Some other show  Was in there  Just doing her  Like we used to  She was back and forth  On the dials  Just bouncing with everybody  On the dials  That's it  A couple of nights out  With the radio  She forgot about it 
[01:26:00]  So what show  Replaced us?  I don't think  I listened to that much radio  In the afternoon  After you guys  Yeah  Okay  Probably just you know  Tooling around on the internet  And I did  You know I grew up  A little bit  A little NPR  Oh  You know Air America  Boring  I know  What can I tell you  But what I did want to say  Is that  I am so disappointed  That you guys  Watch American Idol  I could not believe  When I heard you  No homo 
[01:26:30]  Yeah no homo though  No homo  That's okay  That's okay  Because you know  No homo  Lots and lots  Of homo  You don't  You don't partake  I do not partake  Of the Idol  It's just one of those things  We kind of got caught up  In this season  And please don't  Hold it against us  And let's be honest  Catherine McPhee  Is doable  If she lost 15-20 pounds  I don't even know  Who that is  15-20 pounds  She'd be very doable  I did watch the first season  And then the second season  I watched like  The humiliating auditions  Yeah 
[01:27:00]  And that was it  You lost interest  What do you watch there  Caroline?  Caroline  But  It should just be one name  Doesn't matter  I mean come on  Anyway  You have to go through  Your life  You know  Correcting people  It should just be one name  Why Caroline and Caroline anyway?  I'll be Caroline  And by the way  We're still talking about  American Idol  Because you had a call up  And say  I can't believe you guys  Are talking about  American Idol  It's not my fault  You guys broke  But  Anyway  What do I watch?

[01:31:30]  Well to tell you the truth  No buzz  Great  There is no buzz  That's wonderful  I really haven't  Listened to free FM  Since it came along  Yeah we're starting  From a very  Very tough position  Yeah  We're starting  With absolutely  No listeners  On regular radio  Yes  The basement  And then we got  No Filter Paul  An O&A Pest  From New York  One of our  Hardcore O&A Pests  From New York City  What's up  No Filter Paul  Hey good morning guys  Your mic's not on  Of course  Why would the mics  Work in this studio  They don't work

[01:33:00]  Like you're at  Thanksgiving with grandma  No you don't want me  To make believe  That I'm with family  A lot of cursing  Going on there  Oh absolutely  He looks like  Uncle Fester  Don't worry  You'll get it down  Like that  But I bet you  Right now  That pal crack  Has got  Got their  You know  They're trying  Wow you're real  Nervous  Nervous  Oh my god  Nervous  Look how nervous  He is  On the internet  He's  You're nervous  You're nervous  Well what they 
[01:33:30]  Usually do is  They count the times  That I swear  Right  So by the time  I'm ending a sentence  They're usually up to  About 25 or 26 swears  Well now you can't  Yeah  That's really impressive  There Sonny  Yeah and no filter  Paul are you nervous  No I think I'm fine  I think I'm okay  I just want to say hi  To all the obviously  Darker audience  On Free FM  Now you haven't  Got to pay for this  Oh he's giving  Shout outs  To dark  Racist  To all the minorities  Shout outs  He's very racist 
[01:34:00]  We call him  No filter Paul  Because he doesn't  Have that filter  In his head  That everyone else  Seems to have  Or most people  Seem to have  Where you don't  Blurt things out  In certain company  You kind of  Keep control  Of yourself  He doesn't have  Any of that  He will  He will come out  With the worst  Racist comments  In a diner  Where there's  You know  The waitresses  Of color  And telling  Bad Puerto Rican 
[01:34:30]  Jokes  Negro  Where are my  Fries  Yeah he'll say  Things like that  Like it's just  He is the worst  And he has  Absolutely no muscle  Tone  He couldn't  Protect himself  No he'd get  His ass kicked  And he just  Like doesn't care  And if you want  To kick no filter  Paul's ass  He'll be outside  The studio  In about a half  Hour by the way  I'm not going to  Let you get away  With that crap  I was playing  Three card poker  Once  In Atlantic City  I think it was  And no filter  Paul was there  And he's sitting  At the table 
[01:35:00]  And I turn up  A couple of spades  And I'm hoping  For the flush  In three card  You know you get  Three spades  It's a flush  And he goes  I bet this is  The first time  You're hoping  To see another  Spade  And like there's  Black people  At the table  He's making  Gay jokes  And the dealer  Is obviously  Flamboyant  Over the top  Gay  And he's just  Making it  Will you shuffle  Those with your  Ass  He's like  Wait could you  Could you just 
[01:35:30]  Tame it down  For a second  I went out  To dinner  With no filter  Paul and his  Lovely wife  Denise  And my brother  Quinn  And Jim Norton  We were introduced  To no filter  Paul  Jim's like  You gotta meet  This freak  You know  You gotta meet him  He'll give us  You know  Good radio  Whatever  So we went  To a sushi joint  And that was  The last time  I'll ever hang out  With you  No  He's too embarrassing  To be with  Yeah we're eating sushi  And he's just  Making  He's doing his  Black humor  His black jokes  And there's a black  Couple in the sushi 
[01:36:00]  Joint  And even my brother  That can take a lot  Is like  Will you shut up  I'm gonna  And my brother's  Threatening to punch  Him in his face  Like will you  Shut the hell up  He doesn't care  And he's so loud  He's so loud  When he's doing it  And I'm  You know  I thought  This is it  Never again  And then he's trying  To get my cell number  In Atlantic City  When we're at the  Borgata  You know  At a Jim Norton show  You gave him  The wrong number  I gave him  The wrong cell phone  Number  And he was calling  That for a week  Or two  All night  And then  A few days  After that  I guess  And then he called  Me out on it  When we were  At the casino 
[01:36:30]  He's like  Is this  Opie's number  And I look  And went like  Boy you know  I don't really  Remember Opie's number  And I'm just looking  At it like  No  That isn't even close  By the way  In all fairness  To No Filter Paul  And thank you Ben  Ben handed me a note  Paul's wife  Likes black guys  Yeah this might be  The cause for this  There's always  Something that makes  People go down this road  There was one instance  That really stands out  In everybody's mind  Where Paul and his wife  Were at a function 
[01:37:00]  Some kind of function  And there were  Celebrities there  And stuff  And there was this one guy  Who happens to be  A black soap opera star  In England  Yeah  Yeah  And um  Which is shown in New York  On regular TV  Right  So his wife  Disappears for a little while  To go to the bathroom  And I guess this guy  Was eyeballing her  Cause he followed her  The black guy  Followed her  Into the bathroom  Pinned her up  Against the wall  And forced her  To perform 
[01:37:30]  A sex favor  That's what she says  Is what she said  Cause I think  She needed an excuse  For Paul  It sounded like  She was really  Really into it  Really like into it  And obviously  She never reported this  And she later said  She enjoyed doing it  Right  Did she walk up to you  And say  No cheating  No cheating  No cheating  First of all  The fact that you're married  Just be happy  If she's banging  Somebody else  And you don't know why  Go to the mirror  Is that what you do there 
[01:38:00]  Rich  When she's banging  Real comedians  I want to watch  I want to watch  Oh you're going to take  That wrench  That's all right  See that's the difference  Between you and I  Is I want to watch  And see it happen  Cause that will excite me  Okay  No  You never thought about that  You want to see  Colin Quinn  And Bill Burr  That's what you want to see  I want to see  Colin and Bill  Yeah that's what you want to see  Oh boy  Those are the two names  You know  That's it  All right  So you guys are boring everyone  What do you want to do today  Like Sonny has a problem 
[01:38:30]  With no filter Paul right  Yes absolutely  What's the problem  With no filter Paul  The problem is  All right  The last month  Of the assault  On the media contest  God you're obsessed  With what happened  The last month  On the assault  On the media contest  I am obsessed with it  Because  Boring  He keeps digging me on it  And I'm going to keep  Reminding him on it  Boring  He called in Fox 25  Says who  All right  And um  Paul did you  Or did you not  I absolutely did call  Fox 25  And told him  There was some fat ass  In a Santa suit  About to destroy your shot 
[01:39:00]  And they went to the live shot  For .2 of a second  And along came Fatty  In his Santa suit  And they just cut right back  To the studio  He didn't make it  And this was when  We were getting the name out  For the program and stuff  Yeah  And you had it all set up  Did you tell  No filter Paul  You were going down  Doing this  My spotter was on  The message board  And he was  I amming  Chester's ashes  And Chester's ashes  Is his friend  Not anymore  Right not anymore  And he  Obviously called him  And then he called  The radio station 
[01:39:30]  Or the TV station  Warning him  That I was going to be  Doing this  And I had this  Well planned too  Because you know  The full Santa suit  And everything  You had the  Opie and Anthony sign  You were ready to go  Opie and Anthony sign  And everything  And by the time  I got halfway  Between the police station  And the van  Where they were set up  The guy was already  Out of the van  You know  Wrestling you down  Wrestling you down  Yeah  And this was because  No filter Paul  Was already kind of  In the lead  Right  And didn't want  His spot taken away  So he cheated  Pretty much 
[01:40:00]  By turning you in  So you wouldn't  Get a better appearance  Let's face it  You see me in a Santa suit  Doing an assault  On the media  That would have won  Third time in a row  And he snitched on you  He dropped  What an ass  He turned them in  He ratted them out  I don't remember  Any rules  Except for  Don't touch the reporter  And don't curse  I read the rules  First of all  You're both looking  A before picture  Here's the thing  You call him fat  That wasn't that bad  Yeah but you don't  Even pause though  Oh what do you mean  By pause  You should pause  And let it sit there 
[01:40:30]  Let it sit there  For a second  In case someone  You knew it was  Not the greatest line  Because you just continued  I know I wanted to get over it  You want to fill in  All the space there  Like we're going to  Not hear it  If you say it fast  I know  So Paul is this  The first time  You're admitting  That you called  And snitched out  Sonny  I've told him  A hundred times  But I don't think  You ever admitted  It on the air  I don't remember  It was discussed  On the air  That next day  And we decided  Not to say anything  Because Sonny  Was getting really upset  About it  It was funnier  I wasn't getting  Upset about it  If you weren't  Upset about it  We wouldn't be  Talking about it 
[01:41:00]  Honestly I am  Upset about it  I want retribution  You want to smell my ear  No I don't  Let no filter  Paul smell your ear  First of all  Yes  Paul you've never  Smelled his ear right  No  I have the same thing  Anyways  Paul just sit there  We'll explain  Rich is  Rubbing  Behind his ear  Yeah  His left ear  Now really smell  Oh my god  That smells like  Something beginning  With C  I can't say  Oh you're gagging 
[01:41:30]  Is that what  Bonnie's bark smells like  Rich  Oh Jesus  I don't know  She's never been  With a stope star  From England  A stope star  You what  A stope star  Can't you spit it out  You had the lines  You've effed it up  Never been with a stope star  So what does it smell like  No filter Paul  It smells  Atrocious  It's juice from a cyst  Behind Rich Voss' ear  Yeah he can scratch 
[01:42:00]  Behind his ear  And it's some kind of  Defense mechanism  Like a skunk  Not as bad as me  Yeah  Probably not  Alright so what do you want to do  To don't filter Paul  Well I have a couple ideas  I really want to shave his head  But that's not going to happen  Not with that head of hair  Well that's why  Because that hair  Hasn't changed on him  In probably  Since he was eight  And that's  That is my trademark  I'm so sorry  That's why I want to do it  Not going to happen  But the second one that I have  Is I have a couple of bottles  Of fleet  Phospho soda  And I want him to down  Both bottles 
[01:42:30]  What is that?  What it is  What it is  It's better than  That stuff that you guys  Have taken  That Steve's been giving you  Oh it's like  An internal  Anima type thing  It's what you take  Before a colon  What they do is  Wait but you drink it?  Yeah you drink it  It's lemon flavored goodness  Yeah that's going to work  Before nine o'clock  Sonny  Oh it will  It will  It will  How long does it take?  How long does it take?  It takes  Within an hour  Well  Well we got another half 
[01:43:00]  Of a radio show to do  Yeah that's what I'm saying  And what I  I brought some diapers with me  Adult diapers  I want him to put one on  And take the walk over  To the XM Studios  With the diaper on  Why exactly do you have  Adult diapers Sonny?  Is that what your wife makes you wear?  I bought them specifically for you  Yeah  You want him to walk with  Just a diaper?  Just a diaper  No pants on or  Well yeah  I mean  You realize this bit  Is supposed to be  For the CBS show  You bit ruining ass  What do you do  With the diaper?  Whatever  You'll walk  From here 
[01:43:30]  Wait you will walk  From here to the other studio  In just a diaper?  I don't care  You can have your sneakers on  Obviously  Yeah right  And that's it  And your trademark haircut  Right  He's got to drink both bottles  That's not going to do anything  Three ounces  Three ounces of  Fleet Flospo  Wait you don't think  Nothing's going to happen  If you drink this?  No I went to the bathroom  Five minutes ago  Yeah he went to the bathroom  Five minutes ago  Can we throw Sonny out of the studio  And let Eric do this job properly  Because Sonny is a complete boob  And he just  Alright then drink it  Obviously he's  Drink it right now  Alright let me go get it  Down it  And by the way 
[01:44:00]  Because you know  We continue the Opie and Anthony show  We'll let you guys know what happens  Yeah  If anything happened with this  But drink it right now  If you think it's no big deal  Whatever  I think it's  Sonny's saying it's worse than the oxy powder  That Steve's into  I think he's going to need the diaper  Alright  Tell you the truth  Is that what Sonny takes  Before his boyfriend  Puts something  Where that stuff comes out from  Alright what is it  Yeah let me see one of the boxes  Yeah really fast  Because we've got to take a break  Let me see that box  You're going to drink two of these right  And you think nothing's going to happen  Warning  Do not take more than the recommended dose 
[01:44:30]  In 24 hours  Can be harmful  Do not use  If you have kidney disease  Or congestive heart failure  Do not use  Bowel cleansing dosage  Without a doctor's instructions  What's bowel cleansing dosage?  How many?  Probably two  You should just do one for now  Alright  You should just do one for now  Stop use  And ask a doctor  If you have bleeding  From well  No bowel movement after use  These symptoms may indicate  A serious condition  For bowel cleansing  Prior to medical procedures 
[01:45:00]  Or relief of occasional constipation  It's oral saline laxative  Can you get it over the counter?  Absolutely  Alright  What is the dosage?  It doesn't say what a dosage is  One bottle is  The first part of the dosage  For colonoscopy preparation  Alright  He's going to drink  You're going to drink both bottles?  I'm going to drink whatever  The dosage is for  Well alright  The dosage  Just do one bottle  Well Anthony  We'll study the back of the box here 
[01:45:30]  Oh it says lift here  He'll go  Oh whoops  We should have done that  Huh?  Well you were brave  You said you could  You could drink that  And nothing's going to happen to you  Whatever the dosage is  You don't think anything's going to happen  After you drink that  Direction  For laxative use  Dilute dose  In the table shown below  Let's see  Ages  Years  Laxative use  For bowel cleansing  Prior to medical procedure  Only use when prescribed by a doctor  Dilute dose  Below in one glass  Eight fluid ounces of clear liquid 
[01:46:00]  Drink  Then follow with at least three glasses of clear liquid  Do not use more unless directed by a doctor  Never take more than three tablespoons at one time  And Sonny wanted him to do two bottles  Well three tablespoons is what I'm taking  Three tablespoons  I'm taking three tablespoons  Alright  And you hold no one responsible  You don't hold CBS radio responsible  This is not a  Or Sonny Ferrelli  Or Sonny Ferrelli  Say it  No I hold no one  And this is not a hack joke  But I don't give a chance  It's over the counter 
[01:46:30]  And he's following instructions  Alright  Anyone got a tablespoon?  Alright drink up  We gotta take a break  It's the Opie and Anthony program  Drink up  Drink up  Go  Alright no filter  Paul drank that stuff  The stuff  The good old stuff  On the instant feedback  Big Dog from OT.com  Paul's wife says  No Negro  And it's okay  Oh  Is that it?  Hey we got a lot of people checking in  Anthony  Saying that  That was not a good idea  For him to drink that stuff 
[01:47:00]  No it's meant to clear out your system  Before you have to go in for a colonoscopy  Or some kind of exam like that  Get in the pipe  And it clears you out  Now he's saying  Oh I'll take his stuff  I'll take his stuff  Just clean me out  I'll take his stuff  Just clean me out  I didn't understand  Half of what you said  Isn't that English  You're supposed to be speaking?  English mother  Do you speak it?  So how you feeling Paul?  I've got a bit of gurgling down there  But that's about it  You're percolating  A little gurgling? 
[01:47:30]  I thought I was going to hurl for a minute  But it was just bubbling  Bubbling up  A couple of belches  And that was the end of that  So so far nothing is happening  Once it seeps into the intestine  Remember he said he went to the bathroom  And so there's no problem  This will get stuck  That's in your chest  In your neck  It will suck everything  That's not attached  Inside you  Earwax  It will come  Just flying out of you  It's like  I'm telling you  Let's ask Big Kev  He's on the line  Big Kev  What do you got on this  I hope to God  That you guys didn't let him  Swig off that bottle 
[01:48:00]  The whole bottle went down  I took three teaspoons  Before my surgery  Three years ago  And I  Crapped  For two days  It's tablespoons  Actually  Yeah  It's a water blocker  If you  Make him drink water  If you really want to see some fun  Yeah that's what he's doing  Now he's downing  Poland spring bottles  One after the other  It blocks your intestines  From absorbing water  It just pushes everything  Out of you 
[01:48:30]  Wow  It's like being on  The Made in the Mist ride  At Niagara Falls  And that's three teaspoons  And you let him drink a bottle  He's probably going to die  Well we can only hope  Don't worry that Blackout  Will take care of his wife  Yeah there you have it  Hey you want to do some  Jumping jacks  No filter Paul  No  What  Why is it starting to feel a little weird  No it has nothing to do  With a drink  He just doesn't want to exercise  At all ever  It'll help him with the fat smash diet though  Yeah no kidding  John in New Jersey  John what's up  Hey guys what's going on  Hey  I got a change per stomach 
[01:49:00]  Just like Big Ten over there  I had it done about  A couple months ago  In January  And they made me drink  Two bottles of that stuff  And it was  Absolutely horrendous  Paul you're going to be  Don't trust the fart Paul  Don't trust the fart  Don't trust the fart  Don't trust it  Yeah  That could be rough  You're going to be on the toilet  For probably the rest of the day  When does this stuff kick in  It'll probably kick in  With about a half an hour 
[01:49:30]  Forty five minutes  Alright and someone was saying  This was the stuff they used  In Dumb and Dumber  Oh really  For the famous scene  In the bathroom  Yes  Alright John  Thank you  Alright thanks guys  Alright let's go to  Anthony in New York  Anthony what's up  Hey O&A  Welcome back guys  Glad to have you back on the air  Thank you cheapo  What do you got  Let's put it this way  As much as I miss you guys  That's how much he's going to miss his calling  It is the most awful stuff ever invented  I had a little scare with cancer  A few years back  And the doctor made me take that stuff 
[01:50:00]  Not only does it rip you out  It keeps ripping you out  Like into the next day  I had to take two bottles  And I was in agony  Yeah keep being cocky Paul  What do you have to say about that  No I was going to say  That I wanted my colon back  18 months ago  So I'm paying $12.99 a month  Cheapo  It's so bad  That he's going to  That I actually had my  Horrible  Alright now people are saying  You might need to go to the hospital  Carrie  Yes

[01:51:00]  We did this so he suffers  Right  He's got to suffer  He's got to pay  He's got to suffer  Alright let's go to Ed in New Jersey  I mean the phone's ridiculous  Ed what's up  He's going to be sitting on the ball  What's up  He's going to be shooting brown water  Out of his bottom  Alright  Alright there you go  I don't know if that made the error  Let's say hi to Doc Martin  Doc Martin what's up  Dude guys this is going to be very funny  We use this stuff all the time  Before procedures 
[01:51:30]  Are you a doctor  Or you just play one on the radio  He's going to be  All I should say is yes  Don't trust the fart  This is exactly what we would give you guys  Before the pipe  And how long does it take  You know  Everybody's a little different  Give him some water  And it should be funny  Yeah give him a lot of water  But how long  Within a half hour  Alright guys I've got to go  Bye  Alright  I want to ask him all sorts of questions  People are saying half hour  45 minutes  I want to say if he was one of those doctors  That you know  Like the house doctor there  House 
[01:52:00]  On a very special house  No filter Paul  Drinks an uber laxative  And house must fix him  Who's going to clean up this mess  Stupid house  He's convulsing on the toilet  Stupid house  Let's go to  Sam in Buffalo  Sam  Yeah you should do the  Science Hall incident  Make him  Like all the bathrooms  Make him stay in the diaper  And just like  Run around the city 
[01:52:30]  Looking for a public bathroom  There you go  Yeah that's what we want  If he dies  A guy from SVU  Will come  And he'll look at him  He drank the laxative  His wife sleeps with black men  They know everything  From the smallest clue  Yeah  I'm looking at his shoelaces  And I've decided  He's from Pittsburgh  What?  He likes his eggs over medium  Alright Paul  We're going to do the walk over  In a few minutes here  Are you going to throw the diaper on too  Or  He has to  He has to 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  He absolutely has to  Let's see the diaper  Is that it right there?  Alright go in the bathroom  And get the diaper on  I hope you got an extra large one  He needs one of those diapers  Like  Like Maury has on his show  When he has the fat babies on  This baby weighs  300 pounds  And it's 6 months old  Let's bring him out  Let's bring him out  And then there's a buffet table  Waiting for the baby  Yeah  Look at  Oh you're adorable  You're the cutest little baby  Let  Bring your fat little best  I mean your lovely little child 
[01:53:30]  Out here  Cause on Maury  We try to help  It's not just a rolling freak show  Welcome back to our rolling freak show  Ah the Maury Povich show  See he's going to look like  One of those overweight babies  He really is going to  Big gun hanging out  I think Carrie's back  Carrie what's up?  I'm really sorry about my phone  But he's going to need the diaper  Anytime in the next 15-20 minutes  He's going to start having cramping  And explosive diarrhea  Alright Carrie is panicking man  Alright thank you  I hope his stomach clears out 
[01:54:00]  By next week  And when I'm at the Ramada  In Allentown  Oh  What a plug  I'm just saying you know  That is an awful segue  To an awful plug  Anthony  You know we're trying to figure this out  Cause we're doing two radio shows  Every day  I think people are starting to get that  The show continues on  XM Satellite Radio  And some of the stuff we do over there  That we think is really good  We'll bring back here  So you don't feel like  You're missing anything  But here's another idea  Obviously no filter Paul  Is going to just lose it  Within the next half hour 
[01:54:30]  To hour  Okay  What happened?  Oh  His diapers look like  Tidy whities on him  They're not even like diapers  They're twidy whities  It looks like a European bathing suit  That is horrible  You can tell he's uncut  You can see  Shouldn't that be  Shouldn't that be in the back of the diaper? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah do you have that on?  Nothing  That was good  Like forward or backward  Look like  No  Hey Club Soda Kenny  We need an expert  He's not going to get arrested  Walking on the streets of New York  With this right?  No  Turn around  Who cares?  Turn around for a second  Doesn't he look like  Turn the other way  Turn your face  Doesn't he look like  He has a vagina  Yeah you're the only guy  That can put a diaper on  And get camel toe  He's got camel toe  The guy has such severe camel toe  In the front of that diaper 
[01:55:30]  Look at him  Oh my god  Listen so  No filter Paul  Is going to walk over  With us  Here's a suggestion Anthony  Because we're trying to figure out  This whole thing  Oh my god  Hear me out here for a second  If some of the markets  That we're syndicated to  You know on regular radio  If they want to get really motivated  They can call our other show  And we'll give you an update  On this bit  And you can run it on 
[01:56:00]  Whether it's the next show  Coming on  Or an afternoon drive  You know what I mean  To get the update  Yeah  Because it's going to get  I think today  It's going to get a little crazy  After we leave here  With no filter Paul  But we'll  Cut some stuff up  And bring it here  And we'll do that as well  But I mean  There may be someone out there  That is so interested  They need an update  Ben  What email address  Can we give  If some of these guys  Want to get a hold of us  Ben at foundrymusic.com  Alright and then Ben  We'll give you a number  If you really want to tape something  For your show 
[01:56:30]  After us  Okay  Alright  Well Paul  You got the diaper on  You're ready to go  You're going to have to  Take the shirt off too  We're going to have to  Do the Starbucks bit  Next week now  To follow  No  No no  He'll come in  We're going to do it all  We're going to do it all  Alright let's go to Kinsey  From Tennessee  Kinsey what's up  Hey man  I just wanted to  Let you guys know  How good Voss is doing  He is  So good on your show  Yeah we love Voss  Thank you  Rich came in

[01:57:30]  You will  And stop smoking  Every time I go to the bathroom  How many cigarettes have you had  I had one  I put it out a couple times  I had one the whole day  You're just getting a couple puffs  Getting the nicotine in the system  I gotta quit man  Alright Sonny Ferelli  Are you guys going to be friends again  If No Filter Paul  Does what we think he's going to do  In a little while here  Absolutely  I can already  Can hear his stomach rumbling  From where I'm sitting  Really  Yeah  Paul how does it feel  It's definitely rumbling  And tell Sonny to get his head off my lap  Alright here  Here have some more water  More water  There you go  More water 
[01:58:00]  I'm actually getting the feeling  That water is bad  Because that's going to pass out  Of you know  Well  You don't know  I don't know  I've never seen this in action  Water is very good for you Paul  Yeah  Hydrate  I'm going to take Sonny's word for it  And you shouldn't mind his head on your lap  This way it looks like you have one testicle  Can I sit on Bossy's lap please  Oh you're not coming near me  Alright one more phone call here  Joe in Florida  Joe what's up  You guys better open the windows if you have them  He's going to bust  Yeah we have no windows in there  We're just going to have to make sure 
[01:58:30]  He gets into the bathroom  And we get a mic in there  Well he still has to do the walk with us  Yeah we'll see how we  He should take his shirt off too  I mean what's the sense of it  It looks like he's in his underwear  I mean  When you have a body like that  You want people to see it  Well G  You could just roll the shirt up a little bit  Yeah  He's got to keep it on  Well it's up to him  You want to take the shirt off Paul  Maybe if he holds a rope  We could pretend he's in the Macy's Day Parade  Okay  I told you  You know you were doing so well  You were doing so well  Paul 
[01:59:00]  He got up and left  How many minutes do you think  I have no idea  But it's been rumbling since  It's rumbling  The walk is going to do it  The walk is going to juggle everything around  Mix it up  It's going to be really nasty  I'm going to be walking much slower than you guys  Alright  It's going to be great  Hopefully we'll have some good audio  For this portion of the show tomorrow  In other things  Bonds hit 712 last night  I don't know what kind of celebration  He's going to get when he breaks Beirut's record 
[01:59:30]  Yeah  It's a little strange  With all the steroid controversy  Allegations  Allegations  So he's getting closer  It could be any day now  On that one  And also  A really crazy story  And it looks like the New York Daily News today  Or actually the New York Post  Teen executes  Dad's killer  This is how this should be done  Well sometimes these  Arabs come up with good ideas  It's Somalia  They got it  Well they do some things right 
[02:00:00]  They don't do many things right over there  But this one kind of makes sense  Somalia huh  A 16 year old boy  Stabbed his father's killer to death yesterday  In a public execution  Ordered by an Islamic court  Witnesses said  Islam  Sometimes they get these things right  Omar Hussein  45  Was convicted under  Sharia law  Hey why not  Of killing teacher  Sheikh Osman  Molim 
[02:00:30]  Just say  Another savage  Two months ago  After a dispute over  Hussein's son's education  So it was a parent-teacher conference  Pretty much  Is what you're saying  Gone horribly wrong  Alright well maybe this isn't a good thing  After all  It was just a dumb teacher  And a parent getting together  The kid's not doing well in school  The  What?  The father disagreed  The argument escalated  And then what happened?  The teacher kills the father  And then the teacher kills the father  And then an Islamic court 
[02:01:00]  Right  Whatever that's like  Gets  Says that the kid  Can then kill the teacher  How cool is that  If you're a kid  An Islamic court  Hear order that  Molim's son  Muhammad  Should execute his father's killer  In the same manner  That the father was murdered  Stabbed  So somehow  The teacher stabs  The parent there  Yeah  And yeah  This is what they do  Public execution  Everyone got to watch  Wow  He's gonna be in the  Cool group at school now  If you knife your teacher 
[02:01:30]  Like that  And then you get to  Go back to school  I don't know  What kind of school  Are they doing over there  That's not real school  Somalia  Islamic law  Just a jungle  Savages  Yeah  You never hear the word  Like Arab  Or that  Anything positive after  You never hear like Arab  But  Nobel Peace Prize winner  No  You don't hear anything  Islamic law dictated  That the money was given back  To the people  That it belonged to  And never a happy ending 
[02:02:00]  It's always  Somebody was killed  A kid gets to then  Hack apart his teacher  So I'm sure he's  Nice and well adjusted now  Yeah  16  Unbelievable  What's going on  We just  Build the wall  Build the wall  Around this country  We need nothing to do  We got George Clooney now  Saying we ought to go  Into the Sudan  I guess  And help some people  Out over there now  Can we not get involved  With anyone else  Anywhere  Please  What other country  Would do that 
[02:02:30]  Would just  Come on in  Come on in  Help out  No  George go over there  Give them some of your cash  Whatever you need  They love  Hacking other people apart  With machetes  In that part of the world  When they're born  Somewhere else  Or born under  Some other  Country's border  They decide to go over  And hack them apart  It's just what they do  There's no  You can't look at them  And think that  We're going to  Put our morals  On onto them  Yeah  Because George Clooney's  Over there  You know  You can do one thing 
[02:03:00]  Wrong without  You know  Just  Machete  Right there  Yeah  Listen we're running out  Of this part of the show  I cannot wait now  To see what happens  We got really distracted  No filter Paul  Has brought the show  To a halt  You guys were reading  The label over there  What were you reading  The bit that says  Don't take a full dose  Without talking to your doctor  They say that about aspirin too  You talk to the Dodgers  They're just extra cautious  That's all  Dr. Voss  Any gurgling going on Paul  Definitely

[02:26:00]  On XM Satellite Radio  Just got upstairs  I guess Opie had to take the second elevator  The first one was full  No filter Paul in his diaper  No going to the bathroom yet  Ya hump  Apparently he took a partial dump  In Starbucks  When Voss was doing his act  Which I don't think was fair  I think that was supposed to be saved  For the bathroom here  So we couldn't put a mic on it  But  I told Kenny  But he was busy 
[02:26:30]  You know  Now you're going to have to sit  And percolate for a while  It won't be long  It's going to be about a minute or two  Because I can feel it  No you're going to have to sit and wait  And I will shit on your studio floor  We will not allow you to  To go to the bathroom  Until  Until it's going to be a big build up  What does he stink?  What happened  Iraq?  His breath reeks  Oh his breath  Holy shit  That's a little hypocritical  Don't you think?  I thought maybe he was farting or something  As you're holding his nose  But it's his breath  No  I've been belching since I took that stuff  He's English  I'm sure you can  I'm sure you can smell 
[02:27:00]  The last three or four days  And I'm on that fast mash diet too  So your breath always stinks  When you think  Oh that's wonderful  So yeah  Because you're fasting or  Yeah doing the fruit and veg  Me and my wife  I've lost 13 pounds  So I'm pretty happy  13 pounds?  13  13  Well that was a really wonderful walk  I like that  And I know when the weather gets nicer  That stroll is just going to take about two hours  Yeah it all depends on what we got to do  Yeah  I thought Rich Voss' Starbucks was killer 
[02:27:30]  I liked it  You were so nervous  I wish it could have went a little longer  I think him pulling out that penis in your mouth joke  Kind of closed the show  Oh well see here's the problem  I was starting to feel comfortable  And I would have done time with him  Because there were people looking and smiling  Yeah  Right I lost the Asian guys  Because they didn't speak English  But  And the SARS joke might have insulted them on a personal level  The little kid was smiling  He was laughing  Did you see him?  No  No  I had my eyes on him  And the two ladies were watching 
[02:28:00]  But that lady came running over  You can't do a show with somebody  Right in your face  You know  She was in her Starbucks uniform  Right in Rich's face  Going you can't do this here  You can't do this  Oh how many times have I heard that  And then Rich is just trying to explain  How he wants to do his act  Just do it  And you went into it  But then the first joke you come back with  After working the crowd  Is  Nice bag sir  Did that come with a penis in your mouth?  And people are eating  There's families in there  Well 
[02:28:30]  You could have went a little longer  Couldn't you have made a coffee bean joke?  Or  Anything but the  You went right for the cock  No I was closing with that  First of all you said  To work the crowd  No I said stop working the crowd  And get to your act  Yeah  I liked when you were doing the jokes  Because they were getting nothing  You were not getting  They didn't know where your jokes were ending  They thought you were just telling  One long boring story  First of all  In the other studio  You said work the crowd 
[02:29:00]  Someone said work the crowd  Didn't you?  I don't think I did  Oh man you are  Work the crowd  What do you got there?  Coffee?  Where you headed to?  Work?  Work?

[03:05:30]  Was ridiculous  But he at least thought  Okay well this will end  In a bathroom  With my dignity  Guys I gotta go to the bathroom  And then he was in studio  And you could just see  On his face  He's like  Oh no  You know that look  Your poor dog gives you  When he shits on the carpet  Yeah  And he looks up  And he gives you the sad eyes  And he's good  Because he's gotta shit  That's the look he had  He was sad  That he had to shit himself  In front of other men  How degrading

No I just wanted  My wife was really upset  She couldn't come today  To this  So I'm attributing this thing to her  So you guys can bounce  I would have had much better timing  If you didn't continue babbling about nothing  It's a great line  I don't want to shit in front of my wife like that either  You know what I'm saying  I don't blame you  Yeah don't  Steve  Yeah  Can you throw that video up?

Thank you  Yes sir  Alright Vernon  Thank you sir  Alright we don't do shit jokes everyday alright?  Alright  Alright there he goes  Vernon from Alabama  Joining the XM Nation as well 
[03:09:30]  Hey we got the dump sheet in front of us  Yes  See we got to point out  To these knuckleheads  These asses  On all the message boards  You know  Why  Why  Why should I pay for something  That I'm getting for free now?  And we keep trying to tell these people  You're getting so much more radio  First of all you're getting  From the point that we leave the studio  Over there  The walk  The diaper walk  Rich's whole act  Right  All that stuff isn't on broadcast radio  And we're just starting to develop that  Yeah  That's going to get even better 
[03:10:00]  We wouldn't do that if we were just at XM  We just wouldn't leave the studio  No  Mid show  And we've been doing  There would be no reason  No  And we've been doing  Extra show  Five and a half to five hours  Well actually it's six hours  Of material a day  Yeah  You know  And we understand  There's a lot of commercials  In the first half of the show  But already we're trying to take  Take what we do  In the first half of the show  Cut out a lot of the fat  And we're calling it  Opium Anthony on steroids  For the replay  So you don't have to sit through  A lot of  A lot of 
[03:10:30]  Filler  Right  But we're still working on that  And you guys hear  The feed  That is not dumped  Right  Because some things get said over there  And of course  The FCC regulations  It has to be dumped out of  And I think we set the record today  So far  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Seven  Eight  Nine  Usually we've had one  There have been days we had none  There have been one  Two dumps  Usually callers that slip up  But today  Nine dumps  And  Let's see 
[03:11:00]  The first one's attributed to you  Wow really  At 7  10 a.m.  Did you say  Rim jobs  Anytime today  Opie  Opie during a  Yo mama joke  Apparently he was reading a feedback  And that's where it came from  Right  You were reading a feedback  I don't remember saying rim jobs  And it was a yo mama joke  And right when you said it  I thought to myself  That's getting dumped  Oh really  I'm getting very good  I read this whole thing  And said yep  Yep  Yep I heard it  Heard it  Heard it 
[03:11:30]  So for the people that  Just listened to us for free  They did not get to hear me say rim jobs  Rim jobs  At 718  A mere eight minutes later  The second dump  Some shit  A caller  Said you know  Blah blah blah blah blah  And some shit  That got dumped out of  744  Pull out our dicks  Pull out our dicks  Caller talking about homo stuff  Now 
[03:12:00]  Come on people  You know you can't say pull out our dicks  We are  We are trying to skate a little bit  In the first half of the show  You gotta help us out a little bit  You could call someone a dick  You could say don't be a dick  Right  You know something like that  But you can't say pull out our dicks  It doesn't leave anything there  But the fact that you're talking about a schlong  811 AM  This is odd  I haven't listened to free FM  Since XM came along  I didn't see one dirty word in that 
[03:12:30]  But apparently they didn't like the gist of that sentence  And I believe  Who said that?  Sonny?  Yeah  Good one Sonny  First day in  You're in on over there  On their property  And you pretty much say  Yeah  Fuck them  Yeah I love promoting XM  I thought we were one big happy family  But I guess not  We know how to balance it out  Right  We've talked about how we have two girlfriends here  We have CBS and XM  They're two chicks  We gotta keep them happy 
[03:13:00]  And then Sonny  One of your friends comes over  And in front of one of the chicks goes  He loves fucking that other girl  You know  You get us in trouble  With the other girl  Sonny  You gotta be a stand up guy  You're fucking us here  Well I'll tell you  Never mind  Yeah  Yeah Sonny  And then 8.23am  This quote got taken out  Before his boyfriend puts something in where it comes out  That was me 
[03:13:30]  In studio guests talking about laxatives  That was no filter Paul  That was no filter Paul  Sorry about that  At 8.39am we have  He's going to be shooting brown water out of his bottom  Caller talking about a laxative  That was a caller  At 8.46am we have  Water will pass out of you know where  In studio guests talking about laxative  Now  In some context that might be okay 
[03:14:00]  But since we had been talking so much about it  It makes it not okay  There's a fine line here  Some days that same line would not get dumped out  Under other circumstances  At 8.51am  How the fuck  Now I heard this  It was Paul  No I stopped myself  I know you stopped yourself  But  It was close enough  Because you went  How the f  Yeah  And it was like a  Like F-U-K  Yeah  You left the C out  And a whisper 
[03:14:30]  And even  Al Dukes even said  In studio guests  Sort of swallowed the word  But seemed clear to me  I heard it too  And thought  Yeah okay  And then the last one  At 8.52am  Whackbag.com  Whackbag.com  Got dumped out of  We're working on  As Opie said  We're working on the website stuff  Yeah  Steve came in and told me  Things are being worked on  As we speak  Where certain precautions 
[03:15:00]  Will be put in place  That will allow us  To plug certain websites  And things  As long as there's disclaimers  And stuff  They're working on things  And don't worry about it  We tell people  On broadcast radio  Just go to Google  Put in Opie and Anthony  Because the first five sites  That show up  Are all the sites we talk about  Whackbag  Foundry  OpieandAnthony.com  All those pop up  Immediately when you Google us  Just join our MySpace account  MySpace is another way  Yeah  We've had a lot of  Underground websites  We used to have websites 
[03:15:30]  We weren't allowed to plug  On the air  And they used to get  More traffic than anything  It's just  It's part of the  Underground movement  And it works  So a lot of dumps today  How about that?  How about that?  How about that?  We're really getting  Into the groove over there  Almost as many dumps  As Paul took  Yeah, no shit  Wow, Kenny  That was a good one  What are you doing?  Get out of here  Once in a while  It's not a good show  Unless you get a bunch of dumps 
[03:16:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Right  You need dumps  And then, yeah  The final  They called you back  You know what I'm saying?  Hey  Fuck them  How crazy is that?  They had to call us back  That's right  When I read it  I knew it was going to come  I knew the day was going to come  Because they can't follow  They believe I'll find them  Unless they get into it  A little rough  A little rough  A little rough  So it's nice to be the guys  That follow the guy  Hey, let's say hi to Lady Di  Lady Di  Hey, how you doing guys?  What's up?  Lady Di  How's it going?  Great  Saw your cribs, by the way 
[03:16:30]  Saw the video that was made  Did you see that?  Yes  It was wonderful  It really shows you in a whole new light  I bet you're very proud of yourself  I'm not proud of myself at all  Where are you now?  Are you working?  Are you living in a house?  Or are you still behind the  No, not yet  You're still homeless  I'm still homeless  A friend of mine wanted to talk to you  But he had to leave  The guy named Ed?  Yeah, right  Now, Lady Di  Are you on a pay phone right now?  Yes, I am  A pay phone  And how did you pay for this call? 
[03:17:00]  I didn't have to pay for it  It's an 866 number  Oh, how about that?  Oh, really?  Toll free?  So it's toll free  Oh  What are you doing  On a daily basis  To get yourself out of this position?  You used to be employed  You had a family  Now you are unemployed  You've been unemployed  You have a drinking problem  You're homeless  You are filthy  Hanging out with bums  Having sex with bums  And panhandling 
[03:17:30]  Whatever  No, no, no  Yes, you are  We saw  And swallowing hobo cum  And as you always have  You're a compulsive liar  So everything that comes out of your mouth  Unless it's a homeless guy's cock  Is a lie  No  So now, Lady Di  What are you doing  To get out of this situation?  Well, right now  I'm still on welfare  And I'm going to  Try to get on the SAI  Where does it  That's terrific 
[03:18:00]  That's terrific  You're trying to get on the what?  S-A-I  Uh-huh  What is that?  S-A-I  S-A-I  Needless to say  I don't have to explain that  What is S-A-I?  What is S-A-I?  Substance Abuse Initiative  Substance Abuse Initiative  Rehab  Exactly  Because  What is the substance  That you're abusing?  It's alcohol, obviously  Alcohol  So you're drinking 
[03:18:30]  How do you get your money  For your drinks?  Well, we saw her on the video  Panhandling  We saw you on the video  You were panhandling  You were begging for money  In front of a convenience store  Well, yeah  Is that how you make your money now?  No, I don't  Not really  Not these days  And having sex with  And having sex with people  No  That gets you booze  But I don't do that  But no, you do  You had sex with  Railroad Romeo  No, I didn't 
[03:19:00]  And he  Yes, you did  I didn't  No, no, no  You broke the bed  No  You don't remember  You don't seem to remember  You were hammered drunk  Being videotaped  Talking about how the bed broke  Because certain people  Humans have needs  And wants  And you were talking  About having sex  Oh my god  Yeah, well  No, that didn't happen  You're lying again  Alright, hold on  I'm not lying again  Blind Dave wants him  Blind Dave  You're talking to Lady Di  Hey, Lady Di  How you doing, hon?  Alright, I got a question for you  Go ahead  When you got mugged 
[03:19:30]  Did they steal your dignity?  I think my dignity  Digny was already stolen  A long time ago  Oh, well, there you go  Well, you should have some  And kill yourself  You useless piece of shit  Oh my god  I figured that  I figured that  I figured somebody  Would tell me that  Hey, Richard, what's up?  Hey, not much  SAI stands for  Sorry Ass Individual  Sorry Ass Individual  Yeah, we were trying  To figure out  What SAI meant  So  Lady Di  Are you thinking about 
[03:20:00]  Suicide at this point?  No  I never thought about that  No, it hasn't gotten  That bad yet  But the guy named Ed  Wanted to talk to you before  What did he want to tell us?  That he loves you guys  He's been listening to you  Since WNEW  How does he listen?  Well, because when you  When you went WNEW  You know, he had the radio  So he listens to you guys  By the way, congratulations  On being on K-Rock  By the way  How did you hear that?  Oh, that's very easy 
[03:20:30]  Hey, you want to make money?  One of the newspapers  You pulled over your shoulder  At night to keep you warm?  No  You want to crawl around  Mousetraps tomorrow  To make some money?  What's that?  Do you want to crawl around  On a floor with mousetraps  To try to make some money tomorrow?  Sure, why not?  Alright, come by the station, alright?  You want me to stop by the station?  That's what we said  Yes, not this station  The other place  What, XM?  You ass 
[03:21:00]  Oh my god  You are so stupid  You are so stupid  Oh no  We're talking about  The other place  K-Rock  Well, the old K-Rock  It used to be called K-Rock  Yes  Now WFNY  Hold on the line  Jimmy Johnson  Yes  Here he is  Sorry about that  Let's talk to a real human being  Wow  Entertaining  NASCAR's own  Jimmy Johnson  And a friend of the show  We don't know how this happened 
[03:21:30]  But we are now friends  With Jimmy Johnson  I like it  He still hasn't invited us  To a race  Or any of these celebrations  After he wins  One of these races  But we still think  You're a friend of ours  Well, thank you  I'm still trying to figure out  How this relationship works  So hopefully  We'll get you to a track  Well, we kiss your ass  A little bit  You're  Wow  You're tearing it up  Jimmy  Well, thank you  Well, the weird thing is  We were thinking about this  The other day  Every time you call our show  You end up winning a NASCAR race  Man, we've got to keep this going then 
[03:22:00]  You called us before Daytona 500  You won that, of course  You called us before Talladega  Guess what?  You won again  Well, hopefully  Hopefully we carry this into Richmond  That's not the best track for me  That we have this weekend  So I can use all the help  I can get over there  What's your problem with Richmond?  Potholes?  Yeah, potholes  You know, the city just doesn't do a good job  Maintaining the track  Really?  So a lot of the drivers don't like racing in Richmond?  No, I think Richmond's probably  Be serious  Richmond's probably one of the better short tracks that we have 
[03:22:30]  There's a great race that takes place  Unfortunately, I'm usually on 20th watching it  Wow  Why can't you get it done in Richmond?  Is it the short track?  You're not a short track guy?  No, I'm  Like at the Martinsville track  I'm always up front  Lead laps one there  And do a good job on that one  There's just something about this track  It doesn't work for me and my team  And it's not just myself  Hendrick Motorsports just had some troubles there lately  My teammates, Brian Vickers and Kyle Busch  Haven't been very competitive there either  So we're getting better 
[03:23:00]  The Phoenix racetrack's very similar  And set up to Richmond  And we ran well at Phoenix  So hopefully we'll go back  And be able to run the top ten  And put up a good fight  Yeah, but you got the tires  Which tires?  The good ones, Goodyear  The good ones?  Yeah  The special ones?  The good ones  Well, we got Club Soda Kenny  He's not the smartest individual  Yeah, believe me  But he tries really hard  And he noticed on our little prep  It's all about the effort  Well, he noticed on the prep sheet  That you were chosen to test out the Goodyear tires 
[03:23:30]  And that was  What's the big deal with that?  I guess there's only a few that are allowed to do that  I mean, how does that work?  Goodyear's always trying to make sure  That we got the right tire for the racetrack  At Lowe's Motor Speedway  A month or so ago  We had a tire test over there  It just resurfaced the track  So they're trying to figure out what tire they needed  To come back for the race  And I was one of the guinea pigs out on the track  And I actually helped them decide which tire not to bring back  Because the tires that I was on  The right rear blew out 
[03:24:00]  And I crashed at like 205 miles an hour  And down the back straight away  Geez, and what does Goodyear say?  Sorry  Oh, man  Well, thank you for helping us  Yeah, thanks  We'll figure that problem out  And get back to you  We're going back into the lab  Thanks, Jimmy  Yeah  They should make you try out ball tires  Just for a goof  They are balled  They are balled  Oh, I don't know  There's no treads on there  Oh  You only do that like in the  This is when I'm getting close to invite you guys to a race  See?  Hey, Jimmy, I knew there are no treads  I thought there was a little  I don't know 
[03:24:30]  I thought there was a little something  Road racing  When they have their  When it rains  They put the treads on  Well, the more tire on the ground  The more grip that you have  Yeah  There is some  There's, I think, a 30  What?  Three 32nds of an inch of rubber  That we can wear through  But it's flat all the way across  That you have the whole contact patch  Touching the ground  Hey, the short track must heat up the tires a lot more, though, huh?  Big time  Yeah, the tires  And then also the brakes on the small tracks  The cars are so heavy  And the brakes build so much heat  That that brake temperature also affects  The front tires 
[03:25:00]  And sometimes you can get the brakes too warm  And pop a right front tire  Hey, Jimmy, when are you going to put on  Put a wow sticker on your car?  As soon as you show  I think the going rate's probably  Three or four hundred thousand dollars  Three or four hundred grand, man  No shit, right?  That is some cake  As soon as we bump someone else, it disappears  I read something in  I think it was Popular Mechanics  On the pricing of NASCAR  You know, major NASCAR sponsorships 
[03:25:30]  And how much it costs  Just to get, like, the little sticker  On the rear quarter panel  Or, you know, never mind the hood  You know, the hood is the shit  That is  What does the hood go for?  What is the hood going for?  The hood  It usually goes  The primary paint scheme  Like the overall look  The hood  And then what we call  The quarter panels  Which is above the rear tire  Yeah  That whole package is usually  I'd say the lower teams  Are looking for 10 to 12 million  And then some of the top, top teams  Are up in the 20s  Opie?  For that signage 
[03:26:00]  What about it now, Opie?  Wow  You're throwing around a lot of money  Definitely what goes on there  The sponsor also activates the driver  You know, there's a lot of things  That I do with Lowe's  Outside of the race car  And off the racetrack  With commercials and radio spots  And other things  That they tie it into  So if you really look  At a marketing budget  Of a major corporation  20 million dollars  Isn't a lot of money  For the value  That they're getting back  So I think that's why  Our sport has done so well  Because for Budweiser  Lowe's  You know, all the different companies 
[03:26:30]  That are out there  It's not a ton of money  For the exposure they get  You get the guys  That I remember seeing  This years ago  I don't know if they still  Do it though  When you win  And obviously you know  How that's done these days  And you're standing there  Giving the victory interview  That there's some guy  Next to you  Just changing your hat  Every five seconds  Yeah, the hat dance  We still do that  Really?  We all hope that it's  Going to disappear at some time  It looks really bad  All the sponsors  That sponsor NASCAR  And the contingency sponsors 
[03:27:00]  That they're called  They're all given certain things  And perks  And blah, blah, blah  So they all get a photo  With the race winner  Wearing their hat  Yeah  So somebody else  Is pimping that site out  Making money on it  How many hats?  You're trying to conduct  An interview  And there's some guy  Ripping his hat off  And throwing another one on  And then ripping that one off  And throwing another one on  It's so distracting  How many hats  Do you have to wear?  When we're on TV now  We don't really cycle  Through the hats anymore  That's fortunately gone away  So I'll just wear  My sponsor's hat  And then when the hat dance  Starts for all the photos  I would say 
[03:27:30]  It's 30 hats  Probably  30 hats  What a pain  Yeah  Since you only got one head  I know  Let's go to Ken in Rockaway  Ken, you're on with  Jimmy Johnson  Ken  Ken  He's got him  This sucks  Because he might have  A bad phone  Jimmy, you're his  Favorite driver  But  Can you hear me?  Yeah, go ahead, Ken  Oh, let me tell you  It's Tony from Rockaway  Oh, Tony  Jimmy, you are my  Favorite driver, dude 
[03:28:00]  Watching you race  I've got to tell you  It's a thrill for me  Every Saturday or Sunday  When you're racing  I appreciate it  I've got to tell you  That team that you put together  With Chad  I mean, they're phenomenal  I've got to ask you  What is your favorite track  To run at  On the circuit?  I would say  The Darlington track  It's coming up here  In two weeks  The track  It's like a mile  1.3 miles long  It's real old  The asphalt  Is real abrasive  And beats the tires up  And on top of that  You run around the track  Maybe six inches  From the wall  You still put the  Darlington stripe 
[03:28:30]  On your car?  Exactly  They used to call it  You hit the wall  Four or five times  Throughout the race  It's just  Just the way it goes  And they build the right side  Of the car up real strong  So that you can kind of  Lean on the wall  And not do any damage  To the suspension  That is wild  My wife, Tim  Want me to ask you  Real quick, bud  Who is  Like the driver  That you have  The biggest rivalry  With on the circuit?  I would say  Tony Stewart  Because  Obviously he's  The champion  And everybody's  Trying to beat him  And go after him  And I've been so close  To the championship  The last couple years  And then on top of that  The 
[03:29:00]  We don't even  Say them by  Call them by their name  It's just orange  And then we're lows  So that  That was pretty intense  On the corporate judge  Thanks  You're the man, Jimmy  Good luck this year, buddy  Thank you  Good luck  He's off to an  Unbelievable start  Let's go to  Barry in Pennsylvania  Barry  Hey, Jimmy  Jimmy  I just heard that  NASCAR signed a deal  With Harlequin romance novels  I wanted to know  If you were going to  Star in any of them  Coming up  Oh yeah  I'm going to actually  Write two or three of them  Harlequin romance novels  Yeah, right  I've heard this too 
[03:29:30]  Sure  The licensing aspect  Of our sport  Is  You know  A very lucrative  You know  Aspect of it all  So  It doesn't surprise me  But I  That going through  But at the same time  I'm like  Really?  NASCAR was romance  Taking a few twists  That we didn't see  Coming a few years ago  That's for sure  No kidding  Brian in Michigan  Hey, Jimmy  I just wanted to say  Thanks, buddy  I've won  A bunch of money  Off you already  This year  I get you in the draw  For Daytona 
[03:30:00]  And Talladega  I've won a couple hundred bucks  Already  Just saying thanks, buddy  Hey, no problem  I've made a little money too  So we're all doing good  Wouldn't that be  Wouldn't that be great  If they did the romance novel  Years back  And Richard Petty  Would drive around  With wet panties  In his mouth  Instead of a wet rag  That's pretty creative  Writing new things  Yeah, come on  Give me some writing  Let's go to Chris in Atlanta  Chris, you're on  With Jimmy Johnson  Just won Talladega  Jimmy, you are the man  Congratulations on Talladega, man 
[03:30:30]  You've been my driver  Since Dale went away from us  But it's great watching you  And you're going to get  That championship this year  I'm not going to get  Screwed out of it anymore  So do me a favor  And go up there  And hit that Lowe's car  I mean that  Home Depot car for me  You got it  You can say it  I can't  Alright, yeah  He just says the orange  The orange car  Yeah  Chuck in Wisconsin  Chuck  Hey Jimmy  Big fan since you're  With Herzog Motorsports 
[03:31:00]  Out of Sussex here  Yeah  And I was just wondering  If you ever considered  At Talladega  Maybe pulling over  A little bit  To help your teammate  Brian Vickers  Get his first win there  No, I only thought  About passing him  And then once I was by him  I realized  You know, that could have  Been Brian's first win today  But we've  You prick  We've joked about it  We went to dinner  Afterwards on Sunday night  And you know  He's a good sport  About it all  And of course  We're all out there  Racing, doing all that we can  But just as a friend of his  And knowing how hard  He's been trying to win a race 
[03:31:30]  I want to see him win a race  But these things  Are so tough to win  That you know  That thought never  Crosses your mind  One and two  If it did  I think Mr. Hendrick  And Jeff Gordon  Being a car owner  They'd find a new job  For me  Yeah, you kind of  You want to win  I mean  You know, you got teammates  Out there  But Jesus Christ  How often  Do you get the chance  To win?  Exactly  Yeah  I bet they would  Slow down for you though  Jimmy  Yeah  Let him run block  For you man  That's right  Let him get those guys 
[03:32:00]  Off your ass  Yeah, Brian was smiling  When he was telling me  I should have  Cut him some slack  I'm like, no  Hold on a second  If you were behind me  And had the big run  Would you just say  Oh wait  Jimmy needs to win this race  And push me  And he just  With his little  Dennis the menace  Smile and laugh  Giggled at me  So  There you go  Sean in Alabama  We only have a few  Moments left  With Jimmy Johnson  Jimmy, boys  What's going on  This morning?  Hey  How's it going?  Jimmy, quick question for you  Is there a driver  On the circuit  That the majority  Of other drivers  Just do not like  Racing with?  That target  Seems to shift around 
[03:32:30]  To different guys  At different times  So right now  I haven't had any issues  With anyone  But there's  That means it's you  Jimmy  Yeah, it might be  Hey, wait a minute  I don't know who it is  I think I've been  That guy before  So  You know  Robbie Gordon's  Always very aggressive  Out there  I think Mike Wallace  Is always very aggressive  And you've got guys  That are trying to come in  And compete with teams  That don't have the funding  And resources  As the major organizations  And those guys  Drive every lap  Like it's the last lap  And sometimes that  You know 
[03:33:00]  Ruffles some feathers  And stuff  But those guys  They've got to do their job  They're out there  They've got to  You know  Try to do the best  For their sponsor  Do the best for their team  And I don't think  Anything really lingers  On too long  You know  You might be frustrated  At one point in the race  But it goes away pretty quick  Alright, one more question  It's Lady Di  Lady Di  How you doing, hon?  Hey, you got a question  For Jimmy Johnson?  Yeah, sure  Do you know Dale Earnhardt Jr.?  What's that?  Do you know Dale Earnhardt Jr. very well?  Do I know him very well?  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  I've definitely 
[03:33:30]  You know  Got to know him  Through the years of racing  You guys are both great  Well, thank you  I think the first time  I met Junior  He was  We were down in Daytona  I think 98, 97  Right, yeah  And I was staying with Ron Hornaday  In a condo  And Ron Hornaday's son  Ronnie was there  And Junior  And we got in a lot of trouble  A lot of us were racing at the time  And none of us were really old enough  To go anywhere and have any fun  But we found ourselves  In plenty of trouble  Whenever I have a chance  I watch the racing all the time  The NASCAR racing  And everything like that  The NASCAR racing

She's talking to homeless guys  What'd I do for my birthday?  I went over to my dad's house  Yeah  Why doesn't your dad take you in and let you live there?  You know what?  That's a good question  Um  No, it's not  I really cannot talk about that right now  That's a good question  Why?  What happens when you are over there celebrating your birthday?  Does he just then go, alright, get the fuck out, back to the train station 
[03:39:00]  What did he give you for your birthday?  What did he give you?  Yeah, what did he get for your birthday?  I got money  How much?  I don't know, about $20, I think  Your father gave you $20 and kicked your ass out of the house  Yeah, basically  He figured if he gave you $20 you wouldn't come around for a week  You have nothing against my dad  You have nothing against your dad?  Why?  He's treating you like shit  I'm sure he has a lot against you  Oh my god, no, no, no, no  Your father's treating you like shit  You're a daughter in need 
[03:39:30]  Regardless of how much it's totally your fault  But why, why, why isn't he helping you like a father should?  It's called unconditional love  Because he doesn't love you  He does too love me  No, he doesn't  You're a disappointment  You're a complete disaster as a daughter and as a mother  He has to now take care of your son  You think he wants to do that?  How old's your father?  My father right now, he was born 1929  So you figure it out  He's almost like 80 years old  80 fucking years old  And he's got to take care of a kid that's what, 15 now? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, he's 15 right now  A 15  Do you think your father wants to take care of your 15 year old mistakes?  Holy shit  He hates you  Your father fucking hates you  And he shows it every day  He kicks you back out of the house  How does she end up homeless?  How does she end up homeless?  My son is not a mistake  Because she's a bum alcoholic that won't get help  We try to get her help  We try to help for a long time  She don't listen  Yeah, because people out there think  We get harsh with her  But we tried for many, many years  And we ain't buying into her bullshit anymore 
[03:40:30]  You should have been a blowjob  That's right  Look, look  I admit I have a problem  Yeah  Why don't you solve it the way that your son's father solved it?  No  Solve your problem that way  He stepped in front of a train in Jersey, by the way  Oh no, oh no  That seems to be a good solution to the problem  Do you want help now?  I'm trying to get help right now  No, you're not  More lies  Okay, I'm not

Yeah, have E-Rock take the reins  This is what we're looking for today  Let's see if we get enough bits on the phones right now  We're going to let you request some of the short form stuff  That we do on the program  That you haven't heard in a while 
[04:01:30]  Anything from, I don't know, the 100 Grand Clift  To Butt Plug  To, I don't know, the two bar tapes  Yeah, those are good  Maybe a funny song parody you haven't heard in a while  Any of that stuff  You give the show a call  And E-Rock will play your request until noon  So we can get out of here and rest up a little bit  It's been a crazy day  And I just need to go home  I need to go home  I want to go home  Joey Diaz once again in Chicago  Yes, sir 
[04:02:00]  Riddle  Riddle  Riddle, Stanley Park  Thursday, Friday, Saturday  Nice, look at that  Oh, fuck  Very good  Oh, fuck  Very nice  The keyboard here is a mesh  And that could get sticky  Open before  That would be bad  The reason why I'm going to Chicago  Is for the Latino weekend  Because I'm Cuban  And you want to talk about the immigration shit  Let's get it out in the fucking open here  You understand?  Yeah, what do you got on that?  I got, you know, my parents been here since 55  Came here  You're really Latino?  I'm Cuban 
[04:02:30]  I was born in fucking Cuba  Yeah?  Doesn't he look Italian?  Yeah, because I grew up on 88th Street  That's why, you know  You're bold  You got the look  Yeah, but how can you throw these poor little fucking spicks out?  You don't want to let them in  Who's going to cook?  No, we don't want to throw them out  Don't want to throw them out  You don't want to let no board them in  No  No, we keep it the way it is  Okay  Let Whitey explain it to you, man  Hit me, baby  There's a lot of jobs out there that we just don't want to do  Right, absolutely  So the immigrants do it, okay?  Right, absolutely  But if you give them too much, then they're not going to work as hard  They got the fear of deportation in their blood 
[04:03:00]  And that's why they work so hard to get things done  So we know what's happening  They know what's happening  It's all been this thing that both sides know about  It's under the table  But now they're getting a little  Uppity  Uppity, dare I say  Right  They're getting a little uppity and saying  Wait a minute, look at what we're doing for you guys  And now they want a little more because of that  And we're saying nah, nah, nah  We like it just how it is  Because if we wanted to, we could be deporting our asses off every day 
[04:03:30]  Every fucking day  We just don't  It's one of these unwritten things that we both know  Both sides know what's happening  But we just kind of let it happen the way it happens  Now they're going, we want this and that and the other thing  And we're saying, look, we've turned our head  You've got enough  You've got kitchens, you've got lawns  You tighten the borders  You sell some more drugs and fucking  That's it  Someone who has ever happened, has been happening, keep it happening  Who was saying that make it harder  Oh, Carlos Mencia, make it harder to get into this country 
[04:04:00]  So at least we get even better people coming out  Well, get like a five  Like if you go to buy a fucking gun, they make you wait five days  Same shit  Check them out  Make sure they can run hurdles, you know  That's it  Fucking jump fences  Right  Right  Only the strong  And Jimmy had a good take on it yesterday as well  He said, you know, it's like having a mistress  Okay  Sex is good  You're both getting what you want  But then all of a sudden the mistress is like  Hey, when are you going to leave your wife?  When are you going to leave your wife and marry me?  You wrecked the whole arrangement 
[04:04:30]  You just wrecked the whole arrangement  You just fucked it up  You just killed the hard one  By the way, I don't think we could do all requests  The phones went nuts  I know I say exploded a lot  But they really did  And then they just went dead  I think we're  You're kidding  I think we're stressing the system once again  Danny, is that what's going on?  Yeah, we don't know  Yeah  They're still wiping up ice cream  They'll be wiping up ice cream through the Ron and Fez show  Yeah, I see this keyboard now is completely  I must say, who lobbed the cake? 
[04:05:00]  Mars  Mars  He did not take my safety into consideration at all when he did that  Well, why don't you take that up with him and see what happens  He hit  And all the cake was propelled in my direction  And I don't know, by the grace of God  I didn't get struck  You know what?  With any cake  We're pretty cocky  Yeah  We know that  But at any time, Mars and Master Poe could take over this whole place  Yeah, I know  What are you going to do?  No, not with me here 
[04:05:30]  No?  No  You can take both, though?  Oh, my God  I got a pistol  Yeah, he doesn't need fists  I got a pistol  He don't care  Hey, E-Rock, when are you going to start taking requests?  I'm waiting for you to sit in a seat  That ain't going to happen  He's got to clean up ice cream  All right  You know, I don't think Ronnie's going to be happy that his keyboard is full of cake  Mmm, that's good smelling coffee  Um, yeah, he's not going to be happy  Have that laundered 
[04:06:00]  How about we have a truce?  How about we stop with the messes in the studio for just a little while?  Just a little while  How are we going to top a man shitting himself?  I don't know  That's the fucking king  It's the ultimate in making a mess in the studio  The vomiting is nothing  Nothing  The pissing  The woman spraying  Nothing  A man shit himself  What woman spraying?  Oh, we had a woman that, uh, uh, she diddles herself  Right  And we had Big A 
[04:06:30]  Who's this big guy, something  Uh, with a target on his face  About five, six feet away from her  And she just sprayed all over his face  Oh, that's phenomenal  It was, it was amazing  I fucking love it  It was amazing  I used to date a girl like that years ago  Really?  She wasn't consistent though  That's creepy  Some nights it was tasting like an Alabama Slammer  Some nights it tasted like a fucking mint tulip  Is that why you broke up?  Fuck yeah  You gotta be consistent, bitch  If you're gonna spray me  You better taste the same all the time, you know?

[04:29:00]  Thank you. 
[04:29:30]  Thank you. 
[04:30:00]  There you go. Done with that.  Is this on?  Yes, Eric, go ahead.  Is this on?  Eric!  But I'm here!  Is this on?  No, it's not me!  You sound like too many people. 
[04:30:30]  Is this on?  No, that's recorded.  How do you think it's going so far, E-Rock?  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, come on.  Okay, Than, why don't you introduce something?  Jeez.  Like, we weren't planning to do that anyway.  Yes.  I'm breaking down the walls, as they like to do.  We're going to take a request off of instant feedback.  Yes, Danny.  Um, so let's hear a bit...  What?  That's professional.  Whose phone?  Oh, it's fucking Eric.  Let's see who's calling.  Eric!  Oh, it's dugout Doug. 
[04:31:00]  Here, let's answer.  Is this on?  Yes, your phone ringer is on, E-Rock.  Yeah.  I don't know how to work this fucking...  Hello?  Hi, Doug.  You're doing a great job.  It's not Eric, you dumbass.  That's why he said you're doing a great job.  All right, thanks, Doug.  All right, so we're going to hear from, what do we want?  Billy Bong Ripper from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is requesting a gangsta fag bit, but Danny wants  to say something.  Well, I was just going to say, because Paul won't stop bugging me, he wants to plug his  MySpace, so if everybody wants to be Paul's friend, they can do so at myspace.com. 
[04:31:30]  Slash DannyXM202.  Yes.  And you can be Paul's friend.  Mm-hmm.  Here's gangsta fag.  See, I was getting high with my boys one day.  Just kicking back, hanging out in L.A. 
[04:32:00]  When this dude drove by in his really funky bands, I could tell right away this motherfucker  had hands.  Was a white dude, about 30-something.  Kept staring at me, yo, like he wanted something.  He called me over and he asked for directions.  I saw his dick was hard, so I peeped his card.  I said, you're dying.  You know you ain't lost.  You want to suck my dick while I'm jacking you off.  And he said, oh no, there must be a mistake.  I got a wife and a kid, and I'm very, very straight.  So I said, take my number and my name.  You can call me up when you're sick of playing games.  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call.  Cause if you see one fag, then you'll see them all. 
[04:32:30]  He wants him.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants him.  Cause if you see one fag, now you'll see them all.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you mean?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants him.  Cause if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  So I knew that he'd be climbing the wall.  One week later, and he finally called.  He said his family's for a full week or two.  And he was really bored and needed something to do.  So I drove through his crib up in Beverly Hills. 
[04:33:00]  A bomb ass house worth a couple of meals.  He said he wasn't gay, he just wanted to chat.  And I had five or eight to eat massaging my back.  In his wife's room, he gave me some hair.  Went in the next room, fucked on his kids' bed.  Fuck that we fucked like bitches in here.  I came on his face and all over the sheets.  I knew that I was done when I started getting sore.  I grabbed the kid's toe and I wiped my dick off.  He's lying on the bed, still trying to recover.  I'm dressed in a mop as my car, birdies robber.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you need?  He wants him. 
[04:33:30]  Cause if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you need?  He wants him.  Cause if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  The dick was so good that he just could have passed out.  So hold that week, yeah, I'm tearing that ass up.  Cause he loves to ride him and he loves to suck him.  And after I was done, I let my homeboys fuck him.  Now his punk ass calls me every day.  I told him we were through, then he said he would pay.  So now twice a week, I'm getting paid to tap him.  He laced me with the cash and the V's of platinum.  One month later and the cat's out the bag. 
[04:34:00]  Cause this motherfucker started dressing in drag.  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  It was time to cut him off because I'm done with him.  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg.  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg.  Screamin' don't leave, please twist the G.  But this is what you get when you fuck with me.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you need?  Cause if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  So what the fuck you need?  So what the fuck you think? 
[04:34:30]  Cause if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  Hello, I'm Twisted.  This is Tom's life.  Tom is not gay, okay?  I want you to stay away from Tom.  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son.  And we have a life together.  You stay away from me, you son of a bitch.  Lord, no.  Don't twist it.  This is Tom.  I'm calling.  Please.  I miss you.  Twisted.  Twisted, please.  Please.  Please.  I miss you.  I miss you. 
[04:35:00]  Fuck you.  I miss you.  Fuck you.  Um, Mr. Twisted, Mr. Tim, Mr. Tim, um, I just want to know, why am I toy sticky?  And my shoes, they keep sticking to me.  Why?  Why am I toy sticky?  There you have it.  Gangster fag. 
[04:35:30]  Thanks, Travis.  But it's, um, we're filling up the hour here.  O&A are done.  So we're just playing some songs and bits and what have you.  And Danny's got something to say.  Go.  Why don't you turn my mic on?  Oh.  Radio professional.  We only have very precious little time and have a few business items left.  Fifteen seconds.  First, we got to say, Andrew K., we're going to play your request.  Um, that's going to come up in a couple seconds.  First, let's have Paul plug his precious MySpace.  MySpace.  Stop. 
[04:36:00]  I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors, but mine didn't swing from a tree.  It seems so unbelievable.  And yet they're saying it's true.  They're teaching us about it in school now.  That humans were monkeys once too.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me. 
[04:36:30]  I don't know much about his ancestors, but mine didn't swing from a tree.  It seems so much more believable. 
[04:37:00]  Oh, and surely, surely it's true that God made man in his image.  No monkey's story will do.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors, but mine didn't swing from a tree.  This monkey business has to go because it just isn't true.  It's such a disgrace to the monkey. 
[04:37:30]  A disgrace to the human race, too.  Whoa, I'm no kin to the monkey.  No, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors, but mine didn't swing from a tree.  Mine didn't swing from a tree.  Mine didn't swing from a tree.  There you go, the monkey's song.  We are dangerously running out of time tomorrow on the show.  Travis, who's coming in?  Hey, it's Colin.  That would be Colin Quinn. 
[04:38:00]  And what else we got?  Patty's coming by.  She's going to test out the mousetrap bit.  Someone is going to win tool tickets and some cash on Friday.  Very cool.  We will see you tomorrow morning, 6 a.m. on XM and CBS Radio.  Derek, get rid of us.  Bye.  You're finished with this shit.  All done.  All right. </pre>
