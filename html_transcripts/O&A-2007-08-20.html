<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment heavily focused on Don Imus' firing and Reverend Al Sharpton's response.  Opie and Anthony mocked Sharpton's editorial outlining Imus' path to redemption, highlighting perceived hypocrisy and double standards in Sharpton's critique of racial humor.  They parodied Sharpton's voice and persona, engaging in a comedic role-play of a fictional conversation between Imus and Sharpton.  The hosts then transitioned to MTV's censorship of the word "suicide" in Sean Kingston's song, "Beautiful Girls," expressing disbelief and frustration at the decision and highlighting perceived inconsistencies in MTV's censorship policies.  This segment relied heavily on the hosts' sarcastic commentary and impersonations, punctuated by jokes about racial humor, sexual innuendo, and the absurdity of modern censorship. No guests were present in studio.

The show continued with listener calls, starting with discussions about censorship in *Beavis and Butthead* (the word "fire") and the MASH theme song,  and transitioning to a bit about the phrase "Let's get retarded."  The conversation then shifted to the recent deaths of two firefighters at Ground Zero, contrasting American and European cultural sensitivities regarding profanity in emergency situations. A technical issue disrupted the XM satellite radio feed, prompting a discussion about the technical difficulties. The hosts then recounted a dinner with Eric Logan and Don Wicklund, speculating on their perceived homoerotic dynamic, followed by a discussion of the expensive dinner bill and Kenny's struggles with reimbursement.  They briefly touched upon various news stories, including *Superbad*'s box office success, *High School Musical 2*'s viewership, the Utah mine collapse, Hurricane Dean, and the damaged Deutsche Bank building at Ground Zero. Opie shared a dream about a paralyzing car accident, and Anthony described a nightmare involving being burned and raped while falling from a plane.  The hosts also reflected on the bravery of firefighters and police officers. The segment concluded with a call from Stormy in Louisiana, who announced she was driving under the influence of Xanax and planned to flash truckers, prompting a mixed reaction from the hosts. Opie also shared a story about his nephew staying in his apartment.

The next segment began with a call from "Stormylicious," detailing her Xanax-fueled drive with her friend, "Jimmy," leading to a bizarre conversation about her drug use and attraction to her companion.  A caller named Tracy from Michigan then attempted to win a CD prize, engaging in inappropriate and sexually suggestive questions with the hosts.  The show continued with listener calls about past prank calls, including one involving a pizza parlor employee and Super Bowl tickets, and another about getting a book signed by Little Jimmy and a man’s buttock.  Bob Saget, a recent guest, called in, discussing his visit to Walter Reed hospital and his emotional reaction to the wounded soldiers.  The final segment focused on the Opie and Anthony tour, including anecdotes about fellow comedians like Bob Kelly and Johnny Fairplay, and the challenges of performing nightly.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of Johnny Fairplay's unbelievable story about having sex with a midget.  The conversation shifted to Jim Laird's tall tales and then to Bob Saget's upcoming HBO special (with a brief call from Saget).  The hosts teased a TMZ headline based on a *Survivor* spoiler. A significant portion focused on Ed McGonigal's withdrawal from their "Car Crash Comedy" contest, leading to a discussion about seizing opportunities.  The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion about Sam's extremely limited diet, his aversion to most foods, and speculation on the psychological reasons behind his eating habits. Uncle Ted called in, contributing rambling and offensive commentary.

The final segment revisited Sam's extremely picky eating habits, with sexually explicit jokes and comments from the hosts.  Sam's mother called in, confirming his selective eating habits since infancy and recounting an incident with rice.  The hosts speculated on the causes of Sam's behavior, making sexually suggestive remarks about Sam's mother. They planned for Mick Foley to appear on the show to encourage Sam to eat a steak and rice, referencing Sam’s Mick Foley artwork.  The conversation included a listener's vomiting sound being sampled into a song and a sexually suggestive anecdote about Joyce DeWitt. The segment ended with further plans for Mick Foley's appearance and more off-color jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he's been down.  Opie and Anthony.  Cat shovel baseball!  Oh, nice!  I didn't hit him hard enough. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, I like that. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  I like what they added to the intro there.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  See, I can do voices.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Not bad, right?  Not bad.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Here we are on our home court advantage after being away a couple of days.  What day is it?  Um, Monday. 
[00:02:00]  It looks like someone's got a case of the Mondays.  You know, Monday.  I can't do that one.  It looks like you.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  The Mondays.  The Mondays.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  The Mondays.  Monday.  Uh-oh.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I can do that one.  Drink bastards.  All right.  Well, another weekend where we didn't have a weekend. 
[00:02:30]  But boy, did we have a lot of fun down there in Washington, D.C.  Yes.  What a great crowd down there in D.C.  And Virginia.  We did about 8,000 to 9,000 people at the Nissan Pavilion in Virginia.  Just rabid fans of this fine radio show.  The Opie and Anthony show, of course.  And what?  Saturday we go to the PNC.  Yeah.  Out there in Jersey.  That was the big get last year. 
[00:03:00]  We'll see.  We're heading toward 10,000, 11,000 tickets.  Yeah.  It's going to be a biggie.  It's going to be a nice one.  And two in a row here.  Two weekends in a row.  Yeah.  I think we've done that yet, haven't we?  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't keep track anymore.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  That's 877-212-ON-A.  Hey.  We do have lots to do today, man.  Got to talk about Reverend Al Sharpton.  I was on the train yesterday coming home, and he wrote some kind of editorial. 
[00:03:30]  It's five things that Imus needs to do when he gets back to radio.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a hypocritical douche.  And then Jimmy and I were, like, sharing a cab on the way home from the train station  just discussing this Reverend Al thing.  He is just the biggest hypocrite.  He can actually write this stuff and not think back that he was in positions where people should 
[00:04:00]  have called him out and did call him out on the same things, and he just blew him off.  Well, it's just, it's basically, uh, they're just, they're just non-points.  They're just, they're just trite, just drivel.  He has to say something, and this is what he's saying.  I guess, for some reason, he knows he can't pipe up if he comes back, because he's already  been punished, um, and so he writes this thing about what Imus should do, I guess, to prove  that he's repentant.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is so, Imus is proving that he's actually was sorry about what he said instead 
[00:04:30]  of saying it to just try to save his job.  See, he has to justify this now.  Imus has to actually go on and justify to Reverend Al that he was sincere, as opposed to Reverend  Al, who, I, I don't know, he never answers to anybody, he doesn't, uh, uh, didn't pay  his friggin, uh, settlements that he had with, uh, Stephen Bagonis.  Yeah.  Um.  I guess he's still apologizing to employees of Freddy's.  Yeah.  Uh, after yelling about white interlopers, and then, uh, when somebody walked in and started 
[00:05:00]  shooting, I think it was a few days later.  Why they always gotta bring this up?  Why, why, why, why, why?  Why?  Because that's part of your history.  Mm-hmm.  And other people have parts of their history that, um, they don't feel they have to jump  into your life and, uh, and get you to justify him.  Because you won't.  I was.  But then you better, you know, he lives in a glass house, yet he's throwing stones.  I was in shock reading this, uh, on the train yesterday.  I could not believe I was reading this in the year 2007.  Uh, Martha Stewart came back to network television after serving time in prison. 
[00:05:30]  Marv Albert returned to the airways after pleading guilty to assault and battery charges.  And now it looks increasingly likely, though reports will remain unsubstantiated, that  Don Imus will get back to the radio.  Uh, that is his right.  But consumers and advertisers and those of us who shined a spotlight on his bad behavior  also have rights.  Can I just jump in and notice that the examples he uses are Martha Stewart and Marv Albert.  Yeah.  And how about, and 70% of the hip hoppers, uh, have been convicted of gun possession. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  You have to just pick the two old white people and then the third naughty white person.  We also have responsibilities, uh, broadcasters and their companies must decide on standards  that they will abide by.  Sponsors can, and indeed, some should, refuse to financially support blatant bigotry, which  is what led to his firing in the first place.  Blatant bigotry.  Oh my God.  I discussed this with Jimmy on the way home.  If, if, if, if Imus was going for blatant bigotry, he would have used the N word.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  He was using what he thought was very safe words.  He was, everyone knows he was, this is just, again, it's not blatant bigotry.  It was just a white guy using racial humor.  When a black guy uses racial humor, it is, it's poignant.  It's socially relevant.  It's, uh, it's angry.  It's talking honestly.  When a white guy uses racial humor, it's blatant bigotry.  Everyone knows it.  Nobody says it.  It's embarrassing.  That's why some shows get away with some material. 
[00:07:00]  Other shows don't.  Yes.  Because of the cast.  The makeup, the ethnic makeup of the cast.  Most important, if, and when Imus gets back in the broadcasting booth, each of us will  have to judge for ourselves whether his apologies were an attempt to keep his job or whether  he sincerely wanted to uphold standards that would respect all people, regardless of race,  gender, or sexual orientation.  What a dope.  Or sexual orientation, like the Greek homos you yelled about. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, remember that one?  When you were saying Greek homos, Reverend Al?  Oh my God.  This guy is the biggest hypocrite.  And also, uh, most importantly, when Imus gets back in the broadcast booth, each of us  will have to judge for ourselves.  Judge?  No, when he gets back to the broadcast booth, people will tune in to be entertained.  There's no judgment.  It doesn't have to be this big judgment.  No.  Just stop already.  I also want to know, by the way, now that we're obsessed with black people and we're  obsessed with offending any black sensibilities, why is there no pressure on hip hop or anything 
[00:08:00]  like that to not offend other races?  Why is it only don't offend ourselves and white people don't offend us?  Why is it, hey, don't offend Asians, don't offend whites.  Nobody cares about that.  Blacks are just becoming really self-centered.  Here's a clip really fast from the old days.  Reverend Al, white people in caves, Greek homos.  White folks was in the cave when we had good empires.  We learned to admire them, but they knew to admire us. 
[00:08:30]  We built pyramids where Donald Trump ever knew an architect to run.  We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got  around.  There you go.  Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it.  There's the guy getting a lot of respect these days.  There you go.  It even got a, oh, oh, no, he did it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  When are they going to realize that radio shows like ours and Imus, it's just like watching 
[00:09:00]  a movie or a TV show.  So, yeah, we're just trying to entertain people.  Just trying to have a few laughs.  We shouldn't have to explain anything we do on this radio show.  Indeed, if Imus wants to get back in front of the microphone, there are five steps.  He gives five steps.  Reverend Al's five-step plan.  Five steps that he should take to prove that he has learned from the experience and not simply  waited for the Fuhrer to die down. 
[00:09:30]  Fuhrer?  Oh, anger.  Yeah.  You want to start the Reverend Al music?  You want to do the first step there?  Fake Reverend Al?  Yeah.  Huh?  Go.  Well.  Look at, look at for E-Rock.  Yeah.  First, he should squarely deal with the Rutgers fiasco, not just through a cosmetic meeting  as before, but by coming to terms with the women he denigrated in a concrete way. 
[00:10:00]  One of the Rutgers women has filed a lawsuit, and rather than play legal games with her, he  should settle that suit, and she should be represented by the lawyer, Reverend Al Sharpton.  Uh, and any other claims that the team members may make due to their psychological and public  damage, he did to them personally.  See, he should just pay it, but without no court or nothing, just like I paid Steven Bacconis, 
[00:10:30]  and just like I paid everybody else that has filed suit against me for being a race-baiting,  white-hating.  By the way, I got to applaud the Daily News.  I found this thing.  Buried.  Of course.  Buried.  They are afraid of Reverend Al.  Who isn't?  They buried this stupid, stupid editorial yesterday in the paper.  Hi, have you been injured in a slip and fall?  Just call Reverend Al. 
[00:11:00]  I'll protest until we can get the guy to pay you the claim without ever going to court through  what I like to call my guilt plan.  That's right, Reverend Al Law Firm.  We throw the law out.  Can I jump in here?  Any other claims that the team members may make due to the psychological and public damage  he did to them personally?  You know who did most of the damage to the Rutgers women's basketball team? 
[00:11:30]  Genetics?  The rest of the media.  Yeah.  We had another Janet Jackson situation here.  Don Imus did his thing.  He said a quick little comment, right?  It was picked up by a blog, right?  And it would have just went away on its own.  But then the rest of the media had to take what Imus said and replay it over and over and  over and over again until the Rutgers women's basketball team basically was screaming,  could you stop playing the soundbite, please? 
[00:12:00]  You're embarrassing us here.  But the media, the rest of the media has no responsibility in this.  They're allowed to replay the offensive thing over and over again.  Exactly.  Making sure we all got it in our heads.  Because most of us, you know, just don't listen to Don Imus.  That's a fact.  Most of the people listening to our voices right now do not listen to Don Imus.  And never heard the comment live when he did it.  All right.  Are you ready for your second, what?  Your second step?  Your second thing Imus has to do? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, the rules.  The rules.  For I-man.  All right.  Here's number two with the fake.  Just remember.  Reverend Al.  If you are hurt in a slip and fall, I'm the **** you should call.  Reverend Al.  Okay, second.  He should publicly make clear that he sees himself as an example of how we, as a society,  have increasingly allowed the hunger for humor and the drive for ratings to make the American 
[00:13:00]  public immune to the casual expression of racism and sexism.  You Greek homos.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah, you did.  I did say that.  Yeah, back in the day.  Well, we all know what the Greeks like to do.  They like having a sex where they look at the back of each other's heads.  It's been known for years.  They used to wrestle naked.  What kind of **** is that?  That is homo.  His rules. 
[00:13:30]  The five must rhyme us.  Any comment on the second one there, Jimmy?  Specifically, I should state, if true, that he now understands what led to his termination.  Americans of all races and economic levels believe we can no longer move forward as a  society by taking cheap shots at women and blacks or any other group that I really don't  care about, whoever they are.  Did I mention blacks? 
[00:14:00]  There's only a small, small percentage of Americans that feel this way.  Of course.  Most people just like to be entertained, be entertained, have a little fun.  No one likes taking things too seriously because there's a lot of that in your own life.  So when it comes to radio or other things, yeah, you just want to have fun.  And taking cheap shots at women.  I mean, that's what the hip hop community does.  Yeah.  And he sort of went after them a little bit.  And one of the rappers turns around and goes, hey, Reverend, I'll suck my ****. 
[00:14:30]  That's what they told him.  He was not a pariah.  His removal did not undermine his free speech rights.  Of course it did.  What they did was they just blackmailed him and backdoored him and went to the advertisers  and said, we will just remove your job.  Of course you did, stupid.  That's exactly what it undermined.  That is a mob tactic.  It's called extortion.  That's why we got to get groups to fight back.  That's why People Against Censorship is very, very important.  What's the website?  PeopleAgainstCensorship.com?  I think, yeah.  Very important that we get our own groups together. 
[00:15:00]  And it's not just about freedom of speech.  It's not just about a protest where if you're standing outside and the police hose you,  that's freedom of speech violation.  Of course it is.  But when a guy says something that's not an FCC violation and you go to the advertisers  and you say, if you support this guy, we will protest and wreck your process.  That's blackmail.  Yeah.  And it is violating his free speech.  You're an idiot.  They figured a way around the freedom of speech issue.  Of course.  Yep.  To actually, like, you know, knock down your freedom of speech.  We don't like what you're saying. 
[00:15:30]  We're going to have it removed from the airwaves.  Well, I can't do it directly, so I'll take a little backdoor way in and go to the sponsors  and the company and make threats, and then they'll get him thrown off that way.  If there was such outrage over what he said and people said, you know what, I don't want  to listen to this guy anymore.  I don't like him anymore.  And they stopped listening and he didn't have ratings and then he left because his show  fell into the toilet, that's not a freedom of speech violation.  That's just his natural progression after saying something people didn't like is they  walked away from him.  Why don't they wait?  Anybody who has a problem with anything that's said on the radio, wait until the ratings come 
[00:16:00]  out and then see if they took a big dip down, say, see, there was absolutely a problem.  People were offended and went away in droves.  Right.  But if the ratings go up, then what's your excuse?  Right.  People wanted to listen.  That means there's a lot of people out there that are enjoying what's going on?  He brings up in one of his little things here how it's all driven by a drive for ratings.  A drive for ratings.  OK, so if people enjoy it, they get ratings. 
[00:16:30]  If they don't enjoy it, they won't get ratings.  So wait it out.  The ratings come out every month or so.  You could get a kind of a guide on what's going on, but they won't wait a month.  They won't see the ratings because it's not about that.  It's not about how many people are really offended.  It's about you're offended personally.  Right.  And the third one I love because it's basically just the second one with a three in front of  it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the what's the third one, fake Reverend Al?  Third, he should pledge to refrain from attacks on innocent people who cannot defend themselves 
[00:17:00]  and who may not have the coping mechanism to deal with being ridiculed on the airwaves.  It's one thing to ridicule Al Sharpton.  I use the third person.  It's another to attack young women who did nothing more than seek to achieve excellence  in college athletics.  To that end, Amis and his new prospective employer, if and when one emerges, should publicly  release a contract clause, make it clear that he will not be permitted to engage in any racist, 
[00:17:30]  sexist or homophobic Greek comments.  Unlike a contrary clause in his last contract.  He can't make any homophobic.  No.  Only I, Al Sharpton, can make the homophobic Greek homo joke.  I invented the Greek homo joke.  Robin, who who?  What a douche. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, is he?  I just want him to grab his chest and fall face first.  This guy is so full of himself.  I can't help it.  When is the pushback going to happen?  When?  It won't happen.  He is saying that his new contract should be just chock full of restrictions of things  that are constitutionally legal to say.  Of course.  But because Reverend Al thinks he's personally offended by these things, he thinks this contract 
[00:18:30]  should be full of things that say you can't say this, can't say that.  How about I write up Reverend Al's next contract?  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  That'd be a fair, pretty even swap there.  Reverend Al, writing up Imus' contract, I'll write up Reverend Al's.  And we'll list things that he shouldn't be able to talk about or say.  And how about we go, what is the station he used to work for?  The black station that he was on?  Was it LIB?  Oh, LIB.  Oof.  If someone has audio of other days.  I would love to.  I know someone's got it.  Oh, would I love to get some LIB.  We should go all school and get some LIB audio. 
[00:19:00]  Because that was just infuriating.  But I listened to a lot.  Some great radio to listen to, man.  You want to go with the fourth step for Imus, Mr. Imus?  Oh, number four.  Poor must for Imus when he returns to radio.  Here we go.  The fake Reverend Al.  To show that he is truly committed to turning the page in whatever new show he launches,  I should set aside some regular weekly broadcast time to sit with an ombudsman.  Ombudsman. 
[00:19:30]  Ombudsman.  I'm a black guy.  Preferably a member of the National Association of Black Journalists.  Or someone else of color.  Like a Martian.  Or someone from Neptune.  Who will mix it up with him and critique issues of the day.  No, I'm not volunteering for the job.  Someone else of color.  Like someone being choked to death.  They're purple.  You ever see the face?  He should have a black on his show just to bat around the issues of the day. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  We've got to be hilarious on a comedy show.  So, um, what, uh, what'd you, what'd you do today?  Well, I hung out and, uh, complained about you.  All right.  That's, uh, that's good.  Look, I'm, I'm sorry, uh, about what I did.  That was awful.  I shouldn't have done that.  You're damn right.  Um, is this going anywhere?  Yes.  I yell at you.  I yell at you.  You apologize.  Uh, okay. 
[00:20:30]  Um, I'm sorry.  Not accepted.  Uh, I apologize to the, uh, Rutgers team.  Boring.  Uh, not good enough.  Boring.  Uh, what about those Greek homos?  Okay, now here's something we can talk about.  The Greek homos.  We were doing mathematics.  Building buildings.  Launching spacecraft.  Only phony. 
[00:21:00]  Figure it out.  String theory.  String theory before your crippled white man ever thunk of it.  White people never say mathematics.  Right.  Uh, okay.  Um, is, uh, is anybody?  Why don't, why aren't the phones ringing?  Anyone entertained by any of this?  Of course they are.  Let me see what the phones are doing.  There's three people listening.  Uh, the, the, the, uh, Don Imus Reverend Al show.  Let me see what's going on on the phones here for you. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Uh, welcome to the, uh, Don Imus, um, Reverend Al show.  Yeah, wait, wait a minute.  It's the Reverend Al Don Imus show.  That was part of my contract.  Part of my contract.  All right.  The, uh, Reverend Al, uh, Don Imus show.  And, uh, boy, people are really tuning into this one.  We, uh, discuss, um, how I'm apologizing and, uh, and, uh, Reverend Al, uh, doesn't accept  it.  Uh, Reverend Al, didn't you once say, um, uh, white interlopers?  Never said it. 
[00:22:00]  Part of your contract.  You can't mention it.  I wrote in the, in the contract.  I'm, uh, I'm sorry about that.  I didn't, uh.  I'm sorry I did that.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm going home.  Hey, Reverend Al, uh, is it true that black people were time traveling long before Doc  Brown?  Way before Doc Brown invented the DeLorean, there was a 57 Chevy Lowrider that black people went 
[00:22:30]  back in time in way before that.  Uh, we're going black to the future.  Yeah, absolutely.  Uh, I, uh, have to agree with this.  Yes, uh, time travel, uh, was invented by a black man.  Yeah.  And, um, I apologize for, uh, thinking that, uh, uh, spacecraft, uh, black people.  Yeah.  Way before, I'm talking, uh, during, uh, there were still dinosaurs on the planet. 
[00:23:00]  That's right.  All right.  I like hearing your new tune, Mr. Imus.  What's that?  He's whistling a happy tune.  He's agreeing with Reverend Al.  Hey, let's do the fifth step for Mr. Imus when he gets back to radio, according to Reverend  Al in the paper yesterday.  This was a fine read, uh, on the train back from Washington.  Uh, fifthly, Mr. Imus should encourage all corporations, including the record industry,  to stop subsidizing and promoting people who engage in racist and misogynistic language. 
[00:23:30]  Even in the name of entertainment, the rules must not be different for black rappers than  they are for white broadcasters.  He's explaining that to Imus?  Yeah.  What?  You jacked it.  Why are you telling Imus that?  Um, Reverend Al, here's a mirror.  Look in it.  Oh my God, what an S. 
[00:24:00]  Oh.  Oh my.  You know what?  You're done over there, fake.  It is not, uh, uh, uh, and it is not our desire to interrupt the life of Don Imus.  We just did at every turn.  Yeah.  At every chance we got.  Oh, it wasn't.  We just want to ensure that he does not interfere with ours.  It was not, and it is not our desire to interrupt the life of Don Imus.  You destroyed a 40-year radio career.  It is not our, no, no, no.  It is not, and it was not, and it is not our desire to interrupt this train on the track. 
[00:24:30]  But I am parking a tractor trailer on it.  Oh my God.  Uh, yeah.  Well, this, uh, this show is great.  Um, still no callers.  No, not a call for the Imus and Reverend Al show.  We haven't offended anybody, which is good because I, I apologize for offending people.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Wait, what, what?  We ain't got no ratings.  We got no, no sponsors.  Hmm.  Now this is a show no one wants to listen to.  Of course not.  But it is not offensive, which is even more importantly than listeners in radio, is that  everyone feels good not listening to the show.  See, if you're not listening to a show because it's boring, that is better than not listening  to it because you are offended.  I am proud.  I have a show that no one listens to because it is not offensive. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, what?  What the hell are you talking about?  Is it true you guys invented the iPhone like a hundred years ago?  We invented the iPhone.  We're just catching up to that.  Right.  It was called the end phone.  We invented it.  Long before Apple.  Long before Apple.  Was it the same fruit?  Yes. 
[00:26:00]  I'm just imagining the company would be named after another fruit.  No.  No, but why don't you make that joke at home, please?  We're scared.  All right.  Hey, we got to get our, uh, we got to get our groups together to push back a little bit.  Just curious if there's any.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Any mention from Al Sharpton on the, uh, the awful four, uh, black teenagers being shot  in the head or three of them being executed in Newark?  I want to know why there's no racial outcry there.  Yeah.  They weren't blacks that did that.  They were, I think, whatever, they weren't black.  They were Latin or Spanish or whatever they were. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were from, uh, I believe a Central American country or perhaps a South American country.  They weren't, but they weren't black and they executed three black students, tried to execute  a fourth one.  Uh, I guess all shots in the head.  Yeah.  Where's the racial mentions in that case at all?  Why is it expected that minorities will just kill each other with no racial motives whatsoever?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, again, if, uh, God forbid, uh, white folk would have done something like that,  wow, Reverend Al would come out of the woodwork.  But why isn't he out of the woodwork? 
[00:27:00]  It's still the same people that are dead.  Sure.  Why aren't you there defending it and, and protesting and trying to get to the bottom of it?  Yeah.  Where, where are you?  Yeah.  Where are you?  Where's the visibility on this?  No money to be made.  In the, in the cab ride, uh, yesterday from Penn station, Jimmy and I were discussing  this Reverend Al thing.  And I go, I look at Jimmy, I go, Jimmy, the whole, this whole I'm his thing with Reverend  Al, I try to have an open mind and see where they're coming from and realize, wow, there  is just, just another way of thinking out there that I, I don't see it at all. 
[00:27:30]  Worlds apart.  How, how, uh, Reverend Al saw it.  I just don't see it.  Cause he's, and I tried cause I'm like, wow, this has become a huge story.  And most broadcasters wimped out and, uh, ran and hid and, and didn't, uh, support  Imus when this all went down.  And I'm sitting there like, am I missing something?  What am I missing here?  And I really try to see it the other, the other way.  Yeah.  And I just couldn't on any level.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow, we worlds apart out there.  We are worlds apart. 
[00:28:00]  It's going to take a whole lot.  Right.  To get these teams together to play nicely.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  Uh, well, they're banning another word.  Might as well stay with this team for a little while today.  We'll tell you which word is being banned on MTV, I believe.  Well, I know it's none of the words you just used.  What?  If they're banned.  Oh, what?  It's not if.  It's not what.  What?  What?  Huh? 
[00:28:30]  Not that one either.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Uh, welcome back to the Imus in the Morning program.  My new co-host, uh, Reverend Al Sharpton.  Yeah, that's right.  Let's have some fun this morning.  Come on, I'm in.  Let's have some fun.  Well, uh, I really, uh, can't do anything with you sitting here.  Uh, you pretty much castrated me.  Uh, there's nothing we can talk about without offending you.  Uh, so I'm, I'm gonna do the weather or something.  You, you've ruined radio, stupid. 
[00:29:00]  I wanna be called the A-man.  Like, you're the I-man?  I wanna be the A-man.  How about I call you the N-man?  Don't get started again now.  You're breaking, uh, rule three, I believe.  In Reverend Al's Rules for Don Imus.  Oh, this sucks.  Can't say anything.  You wanna talk about Greek homos?  No.  The gay people are coming off.  Get me fired. 
[00:29:30]  Let's, uh, talk about, uh,  Hmm.  Yeah, see?  It's not easy, is it?  All right, we can delve into a little racism.  As long as it's not black people.  How about,  how about we just talk about,  Oh, damn it.  How about we talk about the  Uh, no, because then, uh,  somebody will come in here  and be angry  and get you fired.  No, I got power.  I got power.  No one gonna fire Reverend Al. 
[00:30:00]  The A-man.  No, you're the A-man, all right.  The A-H-man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, stupid.  Hey,  paragraph three,  rules ten,  sub-sector five.  No goofing on Reverend Al.  Christ, this stinks.  I want to be fired again.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  More from the, uh,  the Imus and Reverend Al show on the way.  Our phone number,  877-212-0-N-A, 
[00:30:30]  if you got something for the program.  Uh, we're waking up, uh,  uh, to another word that's being banned.  Yeah.  Basically, it's a,  TRL, MTV's, you know,  hit show there,  Total Request Live,  has banned the word suicide.  Suicide.  From Sean Kingston's, uh,  just massive hit song.  Isn't that a big part of the song?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's, uh,  Beautiful Girls,  Beautiful Girls,  I even know this song.  Beautiful Girls.  Because my, my, 
[00:31:00]  my seven-year-old niece sings it.  And she loves the part where,  where the,  where it goes,  suicide,  suicidal,  or whatever.  Yeah.  Well, well,  you know,  MTV and TRL has decided that,  ah,  can't have that.  So they're banning the word suicide  from this hit song.  And now you got us,  like,  sitting here,  you know,  on the radio going,  this isn't,  you know,  this isn't,  it is insane though.  Yeah.  You can't ban words.  Stop.  Just stop already. 
[00:31:30]  Drop my iPhone.  Oh boy.  Good thing it's got the rubber baby  buggy bumpers on it.  Yeah.  Stop,  stop with the banning words.  Especially in this day and age,  because the internet is becoming  more and more powerful.  We all know that most of us  are spending probably more time  on,  on our computers than watching TV.  Yep.  And TV's in a weird situation  right now.  You know,  they're,  they're scared S-less of the internet.  I mean,  you watch TV on a regular basis  and they're,  they're,  they're pushing their own websites  now and everything.  And they're trying to make 
[00:32:00]  some of these shows look like  you're watching the web.  Right,  right.  Like there's that one,  it starts with an eye of course,  because everything internet  has to start with an eye.  And,  they show clips.  It's like a clip show.  Yeah.  Of internet stuff.  Why,  why,  why am I watching that on TV?  Why don't I just go to the internet?  It's funny that,  you know,  TV was so far behind  as far as the internet goes  and now they're trying to play catch up  and they're,  they're scared,  man.  I mean,  I watched the insider,  that dumb gossip show  about all the,  you know,  what's going on in Hollywood  and stuff.  Yeah.  And they don't do their whole, 
[00:32:30]  whole show anymore.  They'll,  they'll leave one or two stories  and go,  if you want to find out  what's going on with this,  go to the insider.com  or whatever the hell it's called.  You know,  they're pushing,  pushing,  driving traffic.  They're trying to drive  their own traffic  to their own websites  because they understand  this is major competition  at this point.  So I don't understand  MTV's logic  to actually start banning words  when people already  are looking at TV  like it's lame.  Because they're the same dummies  that didn't see this  coming to begin with.  So now that these dummies  are trying to push people 
[00:33:00]  to their dumb shows  on the internet,  they're still showing you  TV versions on the internet.  Right.  Nobody,  my girlfriend and I  are watching  some Shark Week,  which we like.  We were watching  some old Shark Weeks  on the DVD set we got  when they came in.  And they were showing  shark reenactments.  There's some really good  footage of shark attacks.  But occasionally  they show you  the reenactment  which is just  it's bubbles  and then red stuff  in the water.  And like a bad fin  that obviously somebody 
[00:33:30]  was just shaking  with their hand.  Red stuff,  fin shaking.  And she's like,  I don't want to see  reenactment.  And I'm like,  you can't watch  a reenactment anymore  when you can go online  and find all the real  shark attack videos,  which they'll show  a lot of on Shark Week,  but they'll cut  some of the truly  graphic stuff.  Well, this is the point  with MTV though.  I mean, the people  that would watch TRL,  what's the age group  seriously,  12 to pushing 20 maybe?  Yeah.  Okay, those people  are, you know, 
[00:34:00]  really understand  the internet.  So if you turn around  and say,  well, we're going to  bleep suicide  from this Sean Kingston song,  these people,  that demo,  they're gone, man.  They're going to go  on the internet  and go,  oh, you guys are  so effing lame.  I don't need you anymore.  And the ratings for TRL  are drastically dropping  over the last few years.  Someone else is pointing out  that Linkin Park's song,  they bleep out the word  noose and bleed it out.  It's just,  this is just stupid,  stupid programming.  Especially MTV's audience. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, like words like  noose and suicide.  How is your target audience  supposed to know  how to deal with their problems?  I mean, that's the answer.  We all know that  when things are too bad,  you stick your head in an oven.  I don't understand  why MTV would remove  that option.  Is there a song  with oven in it?  Probably not.  That's for the older demo.  It really is.  If you're over 70  and you want to off yourself,  find an oven  and stick your head in it.  Pillow.  What is MTV doing?  Major League Baseball  doesn't use  suicide squeeze term anymore. 
[00:35:00]  It's not true.  Adam.  Americans are a bunch  of phonies.  Adam, where'd you get that?  You know what?  I actually read it  in the paper this year  and I heard it  on a Fox broadcast.  They don't call it  a suicide squeeze.  They call it  a sacrifice squeeze now.  A sacrifice squeeze?  It was called  a suicide squeeze.  We're here at  Fox are calling it  a homicide squeeze  to take the attention  off of the suicide person. 
[00:35:30]  What purpose does that serve?  How many people  loft themselves  because some dumb  baseball announcer  said suicide squeeze?  We're losing our minds.  That's a good idea.  I either want to kill myself  or have some  fresh squeezed orange juice.  All right.  Every time  one person  has a bad reaction  to a word,  the rest of the people  go,  we shouldn't say that anymore.  That's bad.  Well,  here's Sean Kingston.  This is the song.  It's huge.  Just a clip. 
[00:36:00]  Don't worry.  Yeah, really.  I love the song,  Reverend Al.  The good one.  I wonder 
[00:36:30]  what would happen  if they would sing  Calypso over  the Stand By Me beat.  Yeah, exactly.  That song is massive  and that part of the song  is the whole song.  That's the hook  that everyone sings.  This is what MTV  did with it.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:37:00]  They don't have you.  It's official.  MTV sucks.  And I know we work  for the same company.  You guys are so stupid.  You don't even know  how stupid you are.  The internet is nipping  at your heels  and you're doing this crap 
[00:37:30]  on TV.  You're popping in dead air.  We don't work  for the same company.  What?  We don't work  for the same company.  Sort of.  It's all sort of connected.  We spun off.  All right.  Then good.  I was like,  oh boy.  But what are they doing?  You're right, dude.  The internet,  it's the same mentality.  What?  They're getting their teeth  kicked in by cable  and they don't look  at the tools  because they're so arrogant.  People that's in like,  whether it's just radio  or whether it's television,  they're so arrogant  that they don't think  anything is going to come  and pass them by,  at least not in the  current administration's 
[00:38:00]  lifetimes  so they don't have  to worry about it.  But now that it's creeping  up faster than they saw,  they're panicking  and they're sending people  to their awful sites  like you just said  and it's just watered down  emasculated drivel  on the net.  Nobody wants to see  that on the net.  No.  If you went to their website,  you'd hear the same thing.  Let me make this  perfectly clear once again.  That is the whole song.  That's not just a tiny  little part of the song  that you maybe  could get away with.  That is the hook.  So there's a crap load  of dead air in there.  Crap load of,  yes, yes, yes.  Because we only played  like a quick snippet,  obviously.  Can I say good? 
[00:38:30]  How stupid is TV getting?  Good for Sean Kingston's  people because they gave  them the option of putting  in denial, in denial.  I think that's a lyric.  They actually have  an alternate lyric.  So MTV gave them the option  of submitting the one  that has in denial  or having it dropped.  Yeah.  They said, drop it.  And by the way,  we're not going to change  what we're doing.  And you know,  every year they have  like the summer song.  Sean, this song is probably  the summer song this year.  And you'd love to know  who the person is,  the one person 
[00:39:00]  that made that decision.  I guarantee you,  I guarantee you,  it's a broad  in standards and practices.  Yeah.  Well, here's the...  She has fat calves  and fat ankles  and she wears like a suit  that's a little bit  too tight for her.  Like a woman's business suit.  They don't want to admit  that they're 35  and their fat hips  are bulging out.  I guarantee that  that's who pushed this.  Hey, here's the official state  statement from a spokeswoman  for MTV.  Oh, there you go.  Of course.  Because we know  suicide is an issue  that so many members  of our audience  struggle with,  we do not take any references 
[00:39:30]  to suicide lightly.  Yeah, but it's somebody's like,  you know,  whether you like it or not,  it's somebody's art.  You know,  and they're kind of,  that word that he wrote  in there  is there for a reason.  The, the, you know,  he's feeling suicidal.  Yeah, but, you know,  put it into a song.  But they have no problem  showing young broads  like dressed in nothing,  shaking their hips.  Yeah, isn't that great?  That's okay.  That's not influencing women,  you dopes. 
[00:40:00]  Back to 1982  with Suicide Solution.  It's so selective  with this crap.  Ozzy Osbourne,  Suicide Solution,  a couple of kids  kill themselves  because they misinterpret  the lyrics of the song  because it's actually  a song about Bon Scott  and alcoholism.  And a couple of dummies  blow their heads off  because they don't understand  what the song  is really trying to tell them,  which is don't drink.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden  Suicide Solution is to blame.  It's the same thing  25 years later.  Same crap.  Here we go.  MTV says it doesn't have  a list of words  that are automatically censored  but instead consider  everything contextually. 
[00:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Well, that context  seems to be  the safest of any.  It's in a song.  It's not being thrown around  in an irresponsible way.  Well, this is...  I'm so excited  about the internet.  I'm so excited  that you can now watch  videos and everything else  and the quality  is right there.  You don't have to wait  forever to download  nothing anymore.  What scares me, though,  is all this crap  is going to go  to the internet next  where this is going  to have all sorts  of standards and...  It's a lot harder. 
[00:41:00]  I'm hoping, man.  I'm hoping.  Because the internet  is all underground, you know?  That's where most  of your good stuff is.  I'm hoping.  And there's so many  offshore sites.  The only problem  is they can block  stuff from coming in.  Eventually, I think  he's right,  but they will do that.  I mean, they will  block objectionable sites.  Great.  And God bless  Michael Harrison.  He's fighting  the good fight.  He works for  Talkers Magazine.  He's had a lot  of things to say  about us.  He's always supported  us and our problems.  He says,  as far as this subject goes, 
[00:41:30]  commercial television  is usually more sensitive  about political correctness  and obscenity  and raw language  than radio.  Radio is usually  more aggressive  and more reflective  of street mentality.  Some stations do run  the edited,  in-denial version  of Kingston Song,  but warns Harrison,  anytime you start  censoring art,  you're heading down  the slippery slope  towards censoring  political speech  because art is a form  of political speech.  Where does it end?  It really is amazing  how people have found  a way to take away  what you want to say  and yet they say, 
[00:42:00]  well, no, no,  we're not censoring  your freedom of speech.  No, no, no,  it's not your freedom of speech.  It's just because of this.  Yeah.  It's like back in 1750,  if you wanted to say  certain things,  well, no, no,  we're not censoring you,  of course,  we're the forefathers,  but we just don't think  that Negroes should vote  or be free.  So don't say that  because it's objectionable  to what our group mentality is.  Yeah.  And it's great,  the bigwigs at MTV,  like,  I don't understand  why the ratings went down.  What happened?  They're dropping.  Where is everyone going?  Maybe we ought to play those. 
[00:42:30]  When were our ratings  really huge?  Okay,  start playing Tubes videos again.  Right.  And Blue Oyster Cult.  Where are they going?  Your audience is pretty smart.  And if they're not getting  what they want  from your dumb,  you know,  show,  they're going to go  to the internet.  Yep.  They're going to the internet.  This is not the time  to go uber conservative  with your crap.  There's an alternative.  There's another option out there  that wasn't out there  years ago.  You know who's ruining it?  Lawyers.  The same lawyers 
[00:43:00]  we've had to sit and meet with  are the same girls  who they'll have to meet with.  Not only the same guy,  the same person,  but the same mentality.  We could be held liable  if somebody does  commit suicide  and the parents  deemed that they were  watching MTV  and that song came out.  We could be held liable.  You want to hear  that dead air again?  Yeah,  that's a good one.  They don't want to do their jobs  and defend the companies.  So all they do  is tell companies  how to be pussies 
[00:43:30]  and not get yelled at.  That's what lawyers do now.  They don't tell companies  how we'll defend you.  It's be a pussy  and let's not get yelled at  at all.  Yeah.  Why do they make the same point twice?  I don't know.  I love hearing just the dead air  with just the lame music  in the background.  Dead air is great.  The hit song of the summer  and this is what they did to it.  What dopes.  Hey y'all!  Sean Kingston!  You're way too beautiful, girl.  Beautiful.  That's why it'll never work.  You have me. 
[00:44:00]  You have me what?  Lean on me.  You have me what?  What?  What?  You have me what?  Lean on me.  All these beautiful girls  They only want to do with your dirt  They'll have you  Have you what?  Have you what?  I feel unsatisfied.  All they do  And that's a real emotion, by the way  to be suicidal  when you get that despair over something  You're like,  Oh, I want her. 
[00:44:30]  She doesn't want me.  I'm on.  Nothing I can do about it.  They just put more emphasis on the word  by removing it.  Yeah.  All you've done is go,  What is that?  Like, what word did they cut out?  And then you have it not in context  You have it just alone  sitting there going,  Suicidal.  That's the word that got taken out.  This is the equivalent of what they've done.  We don't like that word  so we're going to print out the lyrics  but we're going to put suicidal in red.  Yeah.  This way you won't look at us  because it's going right by us.  That's pretty much what they did.  Yeah.  Is My Sweet 16 on MTV or VH1? 
[00:45:00]  MTV.  I think that has little girls  killing themselves  way more than a Sean Kingston song.  Showing little girls all over America  what they can't have  ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Daddy bought me a Lexus.  I think that would bring some people to suicide.  Oh, it's just insane.  It really is insane.  I don't get this on any level.  I'm sorry.  And I never will.  Never will.  All right. 
[00:45:30]  We've got to take a quick break.  We've got tickets, man.  We've got the big show Saturday.  Do we?  We've got the big show Saturday.  The PNC is the big get  as far as this comedy tour goes.  It's going to be the biggie.  Although all the cities have been just unbelievable.  Sure.  The reviews on the show have been unbelievable.  The fans have been coming out in droves.  But last year we, I don't know,  we did like, what, 11,000 tickets at the PNC?  Something like that.  Something like that.  And we're heading toward that again this year.  We've got a pair of tickets to the Virus Tour  at the PNC Bank Art Center this Saturday, 
[00:46:00]  courtesy of Blades of Glory on DVD.  In stores everywhere, Tuesday, August 28th.  We'll take a random caller,  so we've got to hang up on everybody  that had comments about this.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  I'm hanging up on everybody.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I want to apologize to those callers.  All right.  A random caller gets tickets to the show this Saturday.  Go to Virus Tour.  One word on MySpace for all the info.  But give us a call, 877-212-O-N-A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Welcome back to the Imus in the morning show,  the Imus and Al Sharpton show. 
[00:46:30]  Let me tell you, Al, you make me suicidal.  You make me suicidal.  Now I am outraged.  That word is banned under Reverend Al's contract,  paragraph 3, section 5, subsection AA2AC.  No offensive words.  The omnibudsman.  The ombudsman.  Omni. 
[00:47:00]  The omnibudsman.  The black man in the corner is very angry with you,  Mr. Imus.  Ombudsman.  The ombudsman.  Right, right.  I'm ombudsman.  Oh, Jesus Christ, this show stinks.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, the instant feedback going crazy after that last break  where we found out today that MTV,  their good old TRL show,  is censoring the word suicide and suicidal  out of the smash hit from Sean Kingston. 
[00:47:30]  Spectro from Michigan writes,  how many people are struggling with it?  Maybe instead they should ban Dunkin' Donut commercials.  Spectro again,  sounds like a job for the past.  How about if we send in our version of the MTV version  by filling in the dead air?  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  Something more offensive.  That's not a bad idea.  And then Rex from Houston writes,  thank you MTV for protecting me from that evil word.  I'm so glad I can't think for myself. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Just some of the instant feedback coming in this morning.  And now we got a whole list of things that MTV has done.  Censoring music videos, taking words out.  It's unbelievable, actually.  You got a copy of this, Jimmy?  I do.  And again, the artists can always say no.  We don't want to submit it.  But the artists, you know.  How are they going to say no to this, though?  They need their exposure.  Yeah, you need your videos being played.  Well, they could say no more now because the Internet is finally getting to a place  where they're getting some nice exposure with their craft. 
[00:48:30]  Which one do you want to do here?  There's a million examples of MTV censoring.  Some of these are ridiculous.  One of the first ones, they said, apparently the words we've taken over  had the two words work and supply censored in this line.  If you want, we can supply, got enough work to feed the whole town.  I'm supposing those are drug references.  Huh. 
[00:49:00]  Who would know?  I know.  I like the, yeah, hash pipe.  Weezer's hash pipe.  Remember that?  Yep.  The word hash was all obscured.  I love this one.  The old apartment video by Barenaked Ladies and the scene removed  where the protagonist rips the telephone off the wall.  That was my old, that's what my daddy did.  We threw the spaghetti against the wall.  Weezer.  My life should have been edited.  Too violent.  Yeah, Weezer, we are all on drugs.  We are all on drugs. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Which changed to we are all in love.  Of course.  Which completely just changes the entire song.  Of course it does.  That's a silly geese.  Uh-huh.  What else?  Stink Fist by Tool was renamed track number one  since the title was considered too offensive for public consumption.  Consumption.  What else?  What other ones pop out at you guys here?  System of Down's first video, Sugar, was also their most censored video 
[00:50:00]  as it censored the words mushroom, Russian, and anger.  Besides the usual censoring of the F word in the song.  Let me ask you about this.  Russian.  I'm sorry about it.  That's okay.  I'm just thinking about people who have been multiple times accused of pedophilia  and gotten away with it.  Michael Jackson's single, They Don't Care About Us, MTV, has replaced the words  Jew me and kike me with do me and strike me.  In the line, Jew me, sue me, kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me. 
[00:50:30]  According to Jackson, the song had words to describe prejudice,  and it was poor judgment to select Jewish people as explanatory words.  My thing is, why as an artist, and this is just hitting me, is he doing that,  and even though they censored him, there's no public outrage, there's no protest about racism.  No.  Why as an artist was it, is it deemed acceptable by blacks for Michael Jackson to use that as an example of racism in his art? 
[00:51:00]  Why is Imus not considered an artist who used race in his art, but Michael Jackson is?  Just another example.  Uh, Jew me and kike me, do me, strike me.  Now you can say that.  I don't care.  I will not defend certain people.  Yeah, very selective on who's going to defend.  Very selective.  On who he's going to defend.  What an idiot.  Hey, here's my favorite right here.  Remember this song?  Well, let me get to the point. 
[00:51:30]  Let's roll another joint.  Turn away.  Yeah.  They wouldn't say joint.  Huh?  They took the word joint and reversed it.  Well, let me get to the point.  Let's roll another joint.  Turn away.  What the hell is that?  You do-gooders are ruining everything. 
[00:52:00]  I really think it's about the lawyers.  I really think that everybody is so sue-happy, they're like, you know what?  We're not getting sued for it, and the lawyers will never defend.  Hey, just take that out.  Just take that out.  Take that reference out.  When are the lawyers going to be held responsible?  When are the lawyers going to be held responsible when all the ratings drop for all these shows  on TV and the ratings drop for popular radio shows?  When are they held responsible and lose their jobs?  That's what I ask today.  Never.  Because we sit through these meetings, and they make our lives a living hell and make 
[00:52:30]  it harder and harder to broadcast on a regular basis, and they just go about collecting  huge paychecks, and they'll continue doing their job long after we're gone on another  show here.  Mm-hmm.  When are they held responsible?  And someone goes, you know what?  Dude, you're taking this too far.  You're fired.  Yep.  Fire a lawyer.  Wake them up.  You're fired.  How often do people sue for the kids killing themselves and actually win with a company?  It's like, don't you think the money you're paying these lawyers every year is less than 
[00:53:00]  you'd have to pay to the...  It's almost like when a car company comes out with a defect.  Yeah.  A lot of times they do a cost-effective thing.  Do we leave the defect in and take the lawsuits that come with the injuries?  Mm-hmm.  Will that be more or less expensive than recalling all the cars and fixing the defect?  I know.  I saw Fight Club.  Yeah.  That was in Fight Club.  I didn't see that in Fight Club.  I never saw Fight Club.  Oh, no?  That was in the Gene Hackman movie, where he was a lawyer and his daughter was the opposing  lawyer.  I saw it in Fight Club.  Yeah.  Really?  Where Edward Dorton describes it while he's sitting in the plane.  Oh, never saw it.  Yeah.  You've never seen Fight Club? 
[00:53:30]  No, I've not.  Are you crazy?  Oh, Jimmy.  Never saw it.  Really?  I love Fight Club.  Yes, you do.  I swear to God, I've never seen Fight Club.  Although the book is way better.  Is it?  Okay, I'll see the movie first.  See the movie first.  No, no, no.  That ruins it.  Movie first always.  No.  Movie first always.  No, no, no, no.  Something like that, you've got to see the movie first.  I watch the movie while reading the book quickly.  Yes.  That's another way to do it.  You try to keep up?  Yeah.  Watch the movie, but read happy endings while you're watching it.  Ooh.  How about that?  There you go.  Two different things. 
[00:54:00]  I'll be signing it in Boston this Thursday.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  Really, Jimmy?  I like sliding in like that.  Another fine Boston visit for a little Jimmy Norton?  I believe this will be the final signing I do.  It's at Barnes & Noble.  I got so many emails from Boston that were annoyed that I didn't actually do Boston.  So, 6 o'clock this Thursday, Barnes & Noble on the Prudential Center.  And I'll be on Toucher & Rich on our fine station, BCN, 4 p.m.  Finally get to go up and do radio with those guys.  Boylston Street.  The Barnes & Noble on Boylston Street.  Cool.  Very cool.  Let's say hi to Ron in Jersey.  Ron?  Ron.  What's up? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I just want to remind you guys.  You remember Beavis and Butthead?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, you don't remember none of them.  What?  I don't remember that show.  It was one of the greatest shows ever.  Some little douche pyromaniac decided to light his house on fire and then they totally ruined  one of the best bits they ever did.  Yeah, they blamed it on Beavis saying fire and made it so Beavis couldn't say fire anymore.  They censored a cartoon character.  Well, did Beavis, did they lose a lawsuit or no? 
[00:55:00]  I don't know if they answered that lawsuit or not.  I don't know if it was settled or something like that.  But they were definitely blaming the cartoon because the kid would walk around going fire,  fire, fire.  And then the kid lit himself on fire somehow.  Best bit he ever did.  Best bit they ever did.  All right.  All right.  Guys, punch it out.  Thanks.  I like how they took care of it one time.  They take jabs at that.  One time there was a broken pipe and Beavis just started going, water, water, water.  It's not as fun.  It's not as fun. 
[00:55:30]  Let's go to Colorado, Eric.  What the hell are you doing?  Eric?  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Eric.  You know, the theme music to MASH is all about suicide.  Yes.  A couple weeks ago, I was in the original movie.  Yes.  Hold on.  Hold on, Eric.  We're, you know, you got to slow down a little bit.  We're yesing.  It's a little give and take here.  You have to say that again.  Now, just say what is the...  Yeah, start over.  What is the MASH theme music about?  It's about suicide.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course. 
[00:56:00]  I love that.  Thank you.  Got it.  Anyhow, a couple weeks ago, I was watching the movie and the part where they are playing  the song and singing it, all of the words were gone.  It was just the music and it completely ruins the movie when they do that.  Wait.  It's so, uh...  The creepy vocals. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  Rosemary and time.  Shh.  Don't play that.  Don't play that.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[00:57:00]  It's hippie crap.  I like that stuff.  God damn hippies.  Oh my God, I could listen to that all day.  It is great, man.  So much, by the way, it's actually much more recognizable without the lyrics.  Like, the beat is more famous than the song with the lyrics.  So, Eric, what channel played the MASH movie and edited that out?  You know what?  I don't remember.  I think it was...  I want to say it was FX, but it might have been one of the other channels.  I doubt it was FX.  I think I made them put more suicide references in. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  I had no idea that suicide was one of these words.  One of these words.  Words hurt.  It's amazing how suicide has nothing to do with people listening to lyrics.  Yeah.  Hearing the words.  All right.  Thank you.  How about this little tune?  Yeah.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Get into it.  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded. 
[00:58:00]  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  This was the theme song for Retarded Laverne and Sherwin when they would come on our show.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Well, now it's...  Now it's...  Now it's this.  Get it started. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  I'm sorry.  Your son has started.  That's what we're going to do, you know, as a society.  All these do-gooders out there trying to ban all these words, you know.  And I'm talking about all races, all colors, everybody.  We're just going to come up with new words.  New words.  That's just human nature, man.  New words that hurt.  New words that hurt.  That's what we're going to do.  You need version 2.0 of words that hurt.  That's what it comes down to in the end. 
[00:59:00]  We're not going to change as human beings.  We're going to always make fun of people that don't look like us or think like us.  You know what really got me also?  It ties into the tragic story of the two firefighters that were killed over at Ground Zero in that stupid building over there.  Yeah, for the rest of Merger, we had a huge fire over the weekend, I guess, and we lost two, man.  Yeah.  We lost two guys.  That damn drag.  But I was reading the transcripts of the radio communication between the firemen and command and the guys that were outside the building and just really compelling and horrifying transcripts of what these guys were going through inside there. 
[00:59:30]  And there's a lot of use of what are deemed bad words.  You know, bad words.  Seriously?  What words?  I haven't read this transcript yet.  The S word.  You know, it's the way people really talk in real life situations. 
[01:00:00]  You cannot be in a more real life situation than that.  You know, and these are professionals, these are professional people doing their job that they know is dangerous, they know how to do it to the best of their ability, and they're still using these words.  So why is it so bad to have them used in certain places and certain other contexts when it's being used every day?  I mean, you know, I'm sure you go up to Capitol Hill, you'll hear that word a lot. 
[01:00:30]  I'm sure you'll hear a lot of other words.  But for some reason, we have this illusion.  These people have this illusion that they think no one's using these words.  They're never being used.  Take them out of movies.  Don't put them in video games.  Don't do this.  Don't use them on the radio or TV.  We're upset that we have to see, like Rescue Me, they use them on bad words all the time on that, what's considered bad words.  It's on FX.  And people get upset about it.  It's like, that's the way people talk. 
[01:01:00]  You want realism?  That's the way people talk.  When you look at European commercials, and Americans, one thing Americans love to do is we love to deny who we are.  We love denying that.  Like, for a long time, we denied we were racist.  You know, blacks couldn't vote.  In the 50s, it was still like apple pie and mom and everything's great in this country.  We just like to deny our sexual desires.  That's why when you look at European commercials, they'll make sexual references or innuendos.  Those would be really funny, and we don't do any of that.  You know, it's always the empowered gal waving her shoes.  I bring home the bacon, bub. 
[01:01:30]  And that's what Americans do.  We really are fraudulent, man.  It's really beginning to annoy me.  As a country, we're just phony.  Yeah.  We deny who we are and what we like.  Hey, catch up in here.  Another reason just to find the local radio station to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  XM is screwing up more and more lately.  You know that whole let's get retarded, let's get it started, and the mash theme with the lyrics?  No one on the XM side heard it.  So just tune over to your local station because they got it all figured out.  I don't know why. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sick of trying to figure out why.  Wait, what?  The phones are echoey at times.  I don't know.  Wait, that's ridiculous.  That's coming in like crazy, and I know people hate when I say like crazy.  Was it a technical glitch?  I have no idea.  What do you got on that, Thann?  That was not XM's mistake.  Whoever set up the board this morning did not have a certain button to press that sends stuff from certain things over to XM.  So XM did not screw up.  Way to make me look bad. 
[01:02:30]  Sorry.  But screw XM anyway for other things that you know.  Wait, was that you who didn't hit the thing?  No, no.  Who sets the board up?  Please, Jimmy, please.  The gentleman who normally does it is not in today.  So are they going to be able to hear it on that side?  Yeah, the button got pushed, and now it's fine.  What button?  Utility button.  So on the replay, I'm thinking I'll add it in.  We'll fix it.  Fix it.  All right, great. 
[01:03:00]  Just fix it.  Well, I think that XM is owed a something.  I'm never wrong.  I stand by what I said.  Oh, they're...  They're...  Oh.  This one was on us.  XM didn't do it.  It was us.  They're wrong about something.  They are.  We had dinner with Eric Logan and Don Wicklund.  They have the weirdest homoerotic relationship I've ever seen.  It was creepy, right?  Yeah.  At that steak dinner? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  A little creepy.  They're just weird guys.  I missed that.  That was...  You weren't there.  I said, I'm glad I missed that.  Oh, I think you said, how did I miss that?  No.  Eric and Don both married men, and yet they have this odd...  I'm convinced that there's something going on.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what...  I think it's just...  I don't think they're having sex.  I think it's playful things.  Like, maybe in hotel rooms, they'll spank each other if, like, they don't make the quota.  You know, just fun things.  Like, play the towel snap game with each other?  I...  Woo! 
[01:04:00]  I walked away thinking this.  I think they go to bathhouses together?  Yes.  But they don't do anything with each other.  Right.  They both look the other way while one sneaks off with another gentleman.  Ooh.  I think they found a bathhouse, if there are already bathhouses around.  And they wanted to tell each other.  Maybe the last bathhouse of the Washington, D.C. area.  On the ride home, they wanted, like, full, detailed, in-depth description of what happened  at the bathhouse.  They both have a secret that they're keeping.  Not from each other, though. 
[01:04:30]  But they don't do anything with each other.  Well, no, they don't say it to each other.  It'd be like Germans talking about the Holocaust.  They would never say, hey, we're killing people.  They would just refer to it in some...  Like, they would talk about the sexual acts.  But not imply that it was with another man.  Right, right.  Like, how was your day?  Oh, it was great, man.  I mean, we did this.  We did that.  But you would always kind of just not say another man.  There's just a silent understanding between those two.  Yeah, they both look at each other.  You want a minute?  Yeah.  You?  Yeah.  I'm so glad I didn't go to that. 
[01:05:00]  It was good to see...  Now, did you have fun?  I did.  It was good to see Elo.  It was good to see Don and...  Elo just happens to park his $100,000 car right outside the restaurant.  His midlife crisis mobile.  Dude, we pull up in a van, and there's this really, really nice...  I don't even know.  Because I'm not a car guy.  It was a vet.  It was a vet?  It was a vet?  Okay.  A $100,000 vet just souped up and just pimped out.  Just happens to be right in front of the restaurant as we make our first visit to Washington in about a year or so.  And right where the valet is supposed to be, that's where you would pull in, and the valet would take your car. 
[01:05:30]  So he's basically stopping business for the valet people.  And knowing that we were pulling up in a van that was barely running, by the way.  And then we all had to kind of go, hey, Elo, is that your car outside?  Nice car, Elo.  We set him up so he could go, well, it is.  And then we got to hear all about the car.  Yeah.  Did he tell you how he puts the baby seat in the front when he's taking a little Jackson around in your vet? 
[01:06:00]  And then, of course, the valet guy had to come up and go, mister, can you please give us your keys?  No, I wouldn't give my keys.  First, is my car in the way?  You know, this car.  Well, the valet guy came up and goes, does somebody at this table have a Corvette out in front?  And he might as well have just come up and said, excuse me, does anybody at this table have a tiny penis?  Anybody have a tiny penis?  You, sir, can I have your keys? 
[01:06:30]  So, yeah, he has like a $100,000 Corvette.  Yeah.  Very nice.  That we all saw.  And Wickland, his car looked like it was kind of like, like kind of crappy, but he had like an $80,000 Cadillac.  I mean, you know, he had a Cadillac.  Yeah.  Cadillac.  He had a really nice, whatever the little sports car.  Yeah.  CTX, whatever it is.  Yeah.  So he had a really nice car.  I don't know what's going on with those two because they both had their cars parked out front, brand new cars.  And I don't know.  Listen, man.  Last one home is bottom.  We just.  They race.  I just submitted a nine. 
[01:07:00]  Both stepping on the brake the whole way.  Try to be last.  They're still trying to get home.  Oh, you see a brake lights.  They're still making their way.  That's what it sounds like when they get home.  By the way, this coming in from Richard from Brooklyn.  Opie, the last bath houses in New York are called prison.  Ah, true.  Oh, I don't want to hear nothing from Elo or Don Wickland.  I submitted a $900 bill for dinner on Saturday night. 
[01:07:30]  Ain't going to work.  Is it that much?  $900.  Wow.  I don't want to hear crap.  That's a lot of money.  Wait, hold the phone.  I expensed the $900 dinner.  Hold on.  You did this Sunday.  Saturday.  Saturday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  On your own card.  Ah, Kenny's card.  I'm not stupid.  What?  Kenny's card.  I'm not stupid.  Okay.  I was going to say.  I'm not stupid.  I was amazed because I thought you used your own card, but then before we even got back,  you made sure the expense report was already in. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, Kenny already has sent in the expense report.  And after seeing these cars these guys are driving around, you're not even going to question  it.  Pay it.  Pay it.  The boys worked hard down there in Washington.  Well, there was a lot of us out.  Pay it.  The whole crew came out.  We ate.  Me and you and Georgetown.  It was a pretty good joint.  I noticed a little scam that's going on.  What?  I noticed a little scam.  It's at the price of convenience, I guess.  But I noticed that since we don't pay for things like that, it's either Kenny or KTC, 
[01:08:30]  who's my guy, on the road, pays for all the things.  We don't get the points.  Right.  Kenny is getting all these goddamn points.  But the thing is, he has the inconvenience.  I've noticed that, too.  Inconvenience?  Of spending all those points on free trips?  Of submitting the expenses and waiting for the money to come in.  Dude.  That was why, yeah.  You haven't experienced the Kenny call or the ride into work where he bitches, I got  20 large out there I'm still trying to collect from everybody. 
[01:09:00]  You can start breaking legs.  Yeah, they don't pay quickly.  How much money you got out that you've put out?  Put out for our trips?  Why don't you lift the mic up, Kenny?  Be honest.  How much are you waiting to be billed back or paid back?  Well, right now, with this last D.C. trip, it's up to 40.  40.  Wow.  That's the other side of this.  I'm sitting on 40 large.  He panics.  That's good, though.  I'm trying to collect 40 Gs from these guys.  What do you use your points for?  Obviously not hair products. 
[01:09:30]  I was just going to say that.  I know, Jimmy.  I know, Jimmy.  I had to.  I had to.  My mouth was opening.  I had to.  I'm just wondering if you buy things or use it for travel.  I don't know what you're talking about, Anthony.  Oh, okay.  And Chisler won't even get the Amex Platinum.  He has an Amex, but get the Platinum.  How much is it?  75 bucks a year?  Yeah.  Dude, you've got to get the Platinum.  You know, we've got to send Kenny to Charm School.  The black card.  Get the black card.  No, he doesn't.  We have to.  Is that Platinum?  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Listen.  We have to send Kenny to Charm School because we were going out to the Nissan Pavilion. 
[01:10:00]  There was like 12 of us in a van because we were trying to save money.  Yeah.  That'll end quickly.  And we had a female driver.  Oof.  And she was an awful driver.  She decided from the hotel that we needed to see all the monuments on the way to our  big ONA travel virus comedy show Saturday night with the stupidest move ever.  It's a Saturday afternoon.  We're in the middle of a tourist trap to begin with.  We went by the Capitol. 
[01:10:30]  We went by the Washington Monument.  Going local for Washington right now.  And went right by the White House before we hit the highway.  And for no reason.  She wasn't really trying to show us these monuments.  She was making poor decisions on what roads to take away from the hotel.  And we could still see the hotel in the distance 40 minutes after we started our trip to the  Nissan Pavilion.  With the weird turns, like you're not allowed to make a left.  You can't make a right.  There's one-way streets.  So you got to kind of work your way around D.C. a little bit before you can get to the 
[01:11:00]  highway.  But there would have been one left turn out of the hotel parking lot.  And we'd have been on the strip we needed to get to to get to the highway.  And Kenny asked her, he goes, why didn't you make the left out of the hotel?  She goes, there's no left out of there.  It's like, no, there's a left out of there.  You know how many cops are in this van?  Make the F in left.  She should have been, you know.  Should have been forewarned.  Make the left.  And she was the worst driver ever.  She started hitting curbs.  She was hitting curbs.  Kenny had her so flustered that every turn she went around, she would make a right turn.  And the rear wheel is doing that.  Where it feels like you're on one of those Disney rides that are on a track. 
[01:11:30]  And you kind of sweep around because your rear wheel is hitting the curb.  But the reason we need to send Kenny to term school, it's embarrassing for everybody.  His tact is awful.  I love it.  You start cringing inside.  I love that.  Yes, I cringe.  Because Kenny's like, after she hit her second curb, Kenny goes, do you want me to drive?  Yeah.  You want me to drive?  She goes, no.  He goes, then stop hitting the curbs.  And here's how Kenny does it.  His eyes stay open, right? 
[01:12:00]  And he'll go, do you want me to drive?  And she's like, no.  And then that's what he said.  He goes, well, you're going to have to stop.  You're going to have to.  That's cop talk.  Well, you're going to have to stop hitting curbs.  Hitting curbs.  What is she supposed to say to that?  Okay.  All right.  I'll give it a whirl.  She was so frightened.  She was in the middle lane a lot of times on the left lane.  Have you saw that?  She's doing like five miles an hour.  Step on the gas with those big, ugly feet.  She was panicking.  There was a high-profile radio show.  In the van, she was afraid.  Well, she should have driven normal or I wouldn't have complained about her ugly big feet. 
[01:12:30]  I didn't see them.  Oh, because I was looking at the gas pedal going, push it.  And I looked over and saw those talons.  She was horrid.  Doesn't help that Kenny, Mr. Personality, is in the front seat with her.  No, just glaring at her.  Looks like one of Tony's crews, how he dresses.  This lady was petrified.  Me and Jimmy were flipping the bird to her behind her seat.  Because we were sitting right behind her.  So we kept putting our middle finger right against the seat.  And then we'd do some gestures like we were doing sexual things to the back of the seat. 
[01:13:00]  It was really funny and we were laughing.  Two grown men and we were giggling like idiots.  You guys remember, not to put the brakes on this terrific conversation, but remember Andrew from Long Island?  He calls from time to time?  Andrew from Long Island?  We have so many Andrews that are associated with this radio show.  What's this?  We got Big A.  Oh, look at that.  We got Andrew, the homeless guy that jumped on his cake.  We got Space Charlene Diver. 
[01:13:30]  I remember this Andrew.  Well, supposedly he lost his virginity yesterday.  He's 14 years old.  We'll talk to Andrew next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  Hope you had a good weekend.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We got a lot of energy considering we didn't really have a weekend.  I was in bed by 9.53 last night.  Really?  Wow.  I was in bed, yeah, 8.30, 8.40. 
[01:14:00]  I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore.  My chipper's starting to fight.  I can feel it beginning.  She wasn't letting it go.  You felt the build.  And I was so tired, as I always am, after I do certain things by myself.  I'm like, I'm either going to go to sleep right now or fight with her for hours.  Yeah.  So I was very mature.  I'm like, I don't want to fight with you.  I never do that.  I'm Frank Fuel the Fire.  What was the fight about?  She was mad because I didn't call when I got home. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  Like, I said I would call in the afternoon.  She sent me a text.  Hey, I'm out with my friend and her mother.  We're at a play.  Call me later.  We'll have dinner.  Well, you're at a play.  I'm not going to text you back.  So I'm going to the gym and I'm going over a script.  And I was watching a documentary that Roland gave me because we're supposed to be interviewing  people this week, I think.  And, uh...  And how was that?  Hey, I saw someone in my gym, in my building.  I hate my gym in my building, by the way.  But I had no choice, like last week.  I had to do a quick workout.  And an old lady was doing some of that swim walking that Jimmy jokes about. 
[01:15:00]  Are you kidding?  And I'm on, like, uh...  That isn't a joke, Jim?  No, I'm on an exercise...  I'm on an exercise bike, and it overlooks kind of like the lap pool, and I see this old  lady doing swim walking, and I'm thinking to myself, what is that...  What is that doing?  You would have to swim walk for, like, 12 straight hours to burn any calories.  I swim walk for about three minutes a day.  But I would imagine...  Pounds peel off.  I imagine, if you're swim walking, you're probably doing it with a little more, like, gusto. 
[01:15:30]  This lady was barely moving in the water, and she had little floaties on her arm, and she  was moving across the pool, walking back and forth.  Oh, she was in the water.  That's what swim walking is.  You walk in the water.  Not when Jimmy does it.  I do it.  No, no.  I swim walk in the living room.  See, when I see Jimmy do it, I thought swim walking was just walking like you were swimming.  It is.  Jim, I know it's a visual, but could you do a little swim walking for us today?  I love this swim walk.  I'll do something.  Maybe, Anthony, or you can describe it.  This is swim walking.  Look at this. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yes.  His hands go in front of him, almost like he's doggy paddling, but his hands are kind  of bent inward to his chest.  Yeah.  And then he does this ribbon-like move with his hands.  It's amazing.  It's almost like I'm swimming in a very tiny little pool right in front of me, and my  hands are not going out in front of me.  No.  They're crossing over left and right in front of my chest, almost like my  arms are folded in a stern fashion, but they're not folded.  No.  They're loose and out in front of me and swim walking. 
[01:16:30]  Well, you're trying to fold your arms, but you never end up folding them because you're  swim walking.  And I walk briskly.  It's retarded.  It has to be accompanied by a brisk walk.  And this lady, she would go from one end to the pool to the other, and then when she  got to one end, she would stop and then kind of swim walk in place for, I don't know,  like 30 seconds, and then she would go back down to the other side, stop and do it for  30 seconds.  I'm like, what a waste of activity that is.  Wow.  She said that to her.  She just leaned in and said, why don't you die already?  Close the door.  Here's what America's talking about today. 
[01:17:00]  This is what we do.  You can get the news out of the way in seconds.  We got Superbad number one at the box office.  We knew.  Yes.  We knew.  We told you guys.  Biggie.  How great was that movie?  Jonah Hill, of course, the star of Superbad.  He's going to be a big, big star.  Yep.  It's over, Johnny, for him.  We'll never have him back on the show.  Got a hit under his belt, and now it's over.  31 million at the box office.  Wow.  We talked about TRL censoring suicide in that Sean Kingston song today.  High School Musical 2 is most watched cable show ever with 17.2 million viewers. 
[01:17:30]  Starting to get scared, man.  I like to pride myself on knowing what's going on in pop culture.  I have no clue about this high school musical thing.  It is a sensation with the youngsters.  And now High School Musical 2, a most watched cable show ever.  17.2 million viewers.  I couldn't tell you one thing about this thing.  It's hard, though.  A bunch of 15-year-olds are watching it.  It's like, eh, you know.  Yeah.  You do have to get out of that demo eventually, Ope.  You do kind of, you know.  Well, now that I'm in my early 30s, I guess you're right. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  You're outside of the 20 demo.  Hey, Utah miners may never be found.  They're basically saying they're dead at this point, right?  Yeah.  Saying, bah, might not ever even find them.  But the family and friends having press conferences going, hey, come on, man.  Keep looking for us, will you?  That's rough when you've got a very dangerous situation.  Yeah.  A couple of people get killed looking for them.  And it becomes, is it worth sending more rescuers down?  Is the place stable?  Wait, the whole mine is collapsing. 
[01:18:30]  I know that two guys died going down to get there.  Six guys down there.  So there's a collapse and what they're going down to try to find them and they re-collapse?  Yeah, there's another collapse.  For some reason, these big mountainous mines, they shake.  They shake.  And they had one of these shakes.  As you're going down, it just goes.  And the ceilings cave in and the walls fall down on you.  And that's it.  So wait, so a lot of these guys are probably suffocating.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The biggest problem in the mines is the atmosphere. 
[01:19:00]  A lot of it is methane gas.  Some of it just has no air in it at all.  It's filled up with like different gases.  What's your biggest fear?  I finally figured out mine.  Like some people say drowning, being burned alive, falling to your death.  No, my biggest fear is being trapped.  Trapped like that.  Whether it's underground.  Well, that's got to be pretty long.  Or God forbid in a car crash or something where you're trapped and you can't move at all.  That's a bad one.  That is my biggest fear. 
[01:19:30]  Just thinking about it just freaks me out.  How about trapped in a car with your face in a puddle and the car's on fire?  No.  So now you're burning, trapped, and drowning.  That's a fine combination right there.  My dream last night, I woke up this morning.  It was that I was hitting in a car accident.  And I remember saying to the person next to me who hated me for some, I knew the person  hated me.  I'm like, am I dead?  And they're like, no, you're just paralyzed or you're in a coma.  Oh, wow.  That was nice.  My biggest fear is being burned, but it's being burned while falling, and men are raping 
[01:20:00]  me.  Wow.  Wow.  You really get detailed.  Like, they're raping me as we're on fire in a plane and we fall out.  Fall out of the plane.  They don't stop.  They still keep the line going.  I'll have to look into that.  So the miners, they're dead?  I don't know.  We don't know, right?  No one knows.  They have air tanks with them, though.  They have some kind of emergency air tanks.  No, no, but I'm saying is that do they have anything like a pill?  They got to have some kind of a cyanide pill or something.  I doubt it.  If you're trapped down there and you know you're not getting out. 
[01:20:30]  These are miners.  They don't carry around suicide pills.  They just try to get out.  They try to get the hell out.  You hope that they were just crushed and it was over quickly as opposed to like sitting  there hoping.  I think the worst thing would be sitting there going, how many days have gone by?  Three?  They got to be close.  They got to be close to us now and then they're not even close and now they call off the search  and you sit there and go, how long has it been?  A week?  Two weeks?  No food?  Horrible. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, food kind of runs out and there's water, though.  They said there's plenty of water down there.  Yeah.  But, um, see, this is what's freaking eating each other.  Mr. Bildo, I guess, from Detroit, even worse, fall into a chimney or open pit well where  your arms are pinned to your side.  I am getting creeped out.  That's pretty bad.  You can't move your arms.  That is it right there.  Like, just being helpless in a situation.  You watch that movie about 9-11 with Nicolas Cage.  We were trying to get the real cops in. 
[01:21:30]  There's two guys that were trapped in between the buildings when they collapsed.  They were underground.  Are there firemen?  I'm sorry.  Firemen?  Or cops?  I don't remember.  I think they were cops.  And the buildings, one building came down, so a bunch of rubble fell.  So they're trapped under the ground by rubble.  And then they start to get loose.  Like, the one cop gets loose.  And then the other building came down.  And the cop that was getting loose a little bit was completely pinned.  And he actually shot himself because he was really, his chest was carved.  I mean, he was dead.  How did they know he shot himself?  They found his body?  I guess they found his body.  Is that a dramatization? 
[01:22:00]  No, probably not.  Well, plus the two cops that came out alive probably said this is what he did.  Because I think he was so crushed.  He knew he was a dead man.  He couldn't, like, and he was probably suffering.  So he just ended it.  And Nicolas Cage was trapped and his arms couldn't move.  And another guy was trapped below.  If you have claustrophobia, man, that, whatever the movie about 9-11, do you remember it?  Yeah, it was called 9-11.  Yeah, it was called.  World Trade Center.  World Trade Center, I'm sorry.  Yeah, World Trade Center.  Yeah.  Also, Hurricane Dean is hitting Jamaica as we speak. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Well, no, it hit Jamaica already.  Making millions of dollars of improvements.  Yes, that old gag.  No, it is skirted.  Skirted Jamaica.  It was on a collision course, but then it kind of turned a little bit and spared Jamaica.  A few dead, though.  Yeah.  They got some dead people down there.  And now it's setting its sights on the Yucatan Peninsula.  Well, it's got to go over.  Yucatan.  It's got to go over the Cayman Islands again.  And I went on a diving trip two years ago to the Cayman Islands. 
[01:23:00]  And I wish my travel agent would have told me, give it a few years.  You know, they're still trying to rebuild from one of the hurricanes that went over the island.  Whoopsie.  And we went for a ride.  We rented the old Jeep and got on the wrong side of the highway and had some fun checking  out the island.  And I'll never forget it.  Actually, I saw the picture last night.  It just happened.  I was flipping through some old pictures.  And one of the houses had three nooses.  Did I talk about this after I came back from the dive trip?  Three nooses in their front yard to basically tell looters, you know, leave. 
[01:23:30]  Don't you dare.  Don't you dare hit our house.  Because I guess it was in a kind of a nice area and most of the houses were destroyed.  But there were a bunch that were still standing.  And these people were fighting off looters in the Cayman Islands.  And they were writing all sorts of, like, nasty signs on the side of their houses.  And we passed one house with three nooses in the front yard.  I'm like, wow.  Let's get the F out of here.  You hope that was put by the owners as a warning and not the looters as a solution.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  And then, of course, the big story here in New York. 
[01:24:00]  We lost two firefighters down at Ground Zero.  Unbelievable.  There's a building down there.  I have been doing a lot of biking lately.  And I bike down to Ground Zero and check it out all the time.  And what building is that?  It's the Deutsche Bank building.  Yeah, yeah.  Deutsche Bank.  Ever since 9-11, this building, a whole chunk of it was taken out of the side.  Just imagine taking a piece of cheese and getting a nice piece of cheese right in the middle of it.  You know, a block of cheese.  That's what the building looked like. 
[01:24:30]  It was just carved out in the middle.  Here's what happened.  When one of the towers fell, a bunch of the metal from that tower, like Godzilla's claw,  pretty much just clawed the front and side of the building and left huge pieces of steel thrown into it like it was nothing.  Yeah.  Like quills.  It looked like I was down at Ground Zero.  You know, I guess, what, a couple weeks after the whole thing went down, one of our pals snuck us in there.  And that building, I remember it like yesterday. 
[01:25:00]  It was like a honeycomb.  Yep.  Because the whole side was gone.  But you could see individual offices.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And I'll never forget the image of just firefighters with these huge industrial brooms just sweeping the contents of all these offices out and the stuff just falling like 20 stories to the ground, like computers and desks and chairs.  It was someone's belongings.  Yeah, people's lives.  It was just someone's belongings.  And they were just trying to clear out the building.  So maybe it was a little more time passed by. 
[01:25:30]  And then what they did, they kind of boarded up the whole building.  Kind of.  They completely boarded it up.  They sealed it up.  Because they found out that there was all kinds of asbestos and dangerous chemicals and whatnot in there.  So they boarded it up with these plywood and polyurethane boards.  The windows, the doors inside, and even the stairwells.  Like you'd open a stairwell door and the stairwell itself is completely boarded over. 
[01:26:00]  And then there was a black mesh type of thing that covered the entire building.  They put it over the whole building.  And they didn't knock it down.  I had no idea about this.  But Ann told me this morning they didn't knock it down because of all the toxins.  Yeah, all the crap in there.  You know how they usually just blast a building and bring it down?  The dust that would be made would be so toxic.  Yet they were saying that the dust from ground zero, it was okay.  They're not taking care of the health problems of a lot of these first responders because it was okay.  But what went into this building is horribly poisonous and we can't let it out. 
[01:26:30]  It's just a disgrace.  It's a disgrace.  So then apparently a fire was started.  They're saying that now the latest thing is a couple of construction workers were in there and smoking.  The place is like a tinderbox.  What kind of construction are they doing in there?  I think it's just demolition.  It's demolition, guys.  But they're doing a slow job.  They're dismantling the building instead of bringing it down.  Oh, I think I did read that they finally decided they've got to get rid of the building.  Yeah.  So there's like salvage workers, too. 
[01:27:00]  They bring the piping out.  There's people that are trying to contain the asbestos and the dust so they could bring this building down.  And they were smoking, started a fire.  Fire department responds.  They send guys in through the little elevator on the side, the construction elevator, which is really dangerous.  You get up to a certain floor where the fire is, and now you're sending people in a window in a construction elevator that bolts to the side of the building.  That's your only way out now. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know if they knew this because at one point in the transcript I read of the radio transmissions, they said there's no way out of here.  Everything's boarded up.  It would take us days to get out of this building because every entrance is boarded up, and they couldn't get out.  They were running out of air.  Nothing but black smoke that they couldn't see through.  What happened to the elevator that they couldn't find?  They got frantic.  They couldn't find it.  They got caught inside the building.  It's like being in a maze. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, it's a maze.  All of a sudden.  They couldn't get out.  The smoke was so thick.  They started calling a mayday, and then the command started asking for a roll call, you know, who the hell's in, who's out.  Then they said, one of the commanders goes, I don't give an S about the building.  Get my guys out of there.  They were just going to pull the guys and let the building burn or whatever the hell it's going to do.  Come up with plan B.  And there was a mayday.  They couldn't find two of their guys, and those guys died.  Smoke inhalation? 
[01:28:30]  Smoke inhalation, yeah.  Yep.  So, here's a story.  I mean, well, all over America.  Cigarettes started the whole thing?  Yeah.  Some guys up there smoking, apparently.  It's just so odd, too.  This is a firehouse that lost 11 guys on 9-11.  Lost 11 guys, and then years later, two more guys at the same site.  You know, you don't think.  I'm sure those guys, as firefighters, must have thought how horrible it must have been for the firefighters that died down at Ground Zero, 
[01:29:00]  and then they end up dying down at Ground Zero.  So, it's terrible.  It's just amazing.  So, our thoughts go out to their families, obviously.  The young guy, too, also.  Two young guys.  The one guy's a beautiful wife and new kids.  His birthday's today or something like that.  It's just a tragedy.  Firefighters are nuts, man.  I don't know what motivates you to do that.  It's just everyone's biggest fear is being in a building that's burning, and these maniacs run into it.  You ever hang out with firemen, though?  They're a whole different breed of human. 
[01:29:30]  It's like cops, too.  Cops are different people than other people.  That's why they do it.  And firemen also, they...  You know how you like getting up on stage and doing your...  They like fighting fires.  They don't like dying.  You know, I'm not saying they enjoy that they're suicidal and love running in and dying.  But I think they like the danger element.  I think they like the excitement of being a firefighter.  But unfortunately, with that comes the death that happens all too often with these guys. 
[01:30:00]  Well, if the downside of stand-up was smoke inhalation or fire on me, I would like it a lot less.  I mean, for me, the biggest risk is embarrassment.  Yeah, you're going to bomb and come off stage and go, ah, do it again tomorrow.  You're going to hook or it's over.  Yeah, yeah.  That risk, man, that's got to be such more of a high when you're doing that because the downside is so much worse.  So I think it makes you a lot more close to the people that you're with in your firehouse and more distant to everybody else. 
[01:30:30]  That's why it's so...  It's weird to hang out with firemen because you're not part of them, that click.  You can't really get into what they're thinking.  They're very clicky, you know, with the other firemen.  Same thing with cops.  It's kind of hard to get into that whole head.  Like, as far as they're concerned, I think they don't think you understand the whole thing.  And you're not that kind of a person that would do that. 
[01:31:00]  So, I mean, they're cool and everything, but it's a whole different head, man.  And they're right.  Your job.  We don't understand.  Yeah, we don't.  No, not at all.  You going to run in there?  No.  Smoke, screw you.  I'm pulling a George Costanza right out the door.  Get out of the way!  Especially in a grown old lady's...  Were they trying to rescue construction workers?  For the most part, there's no one in that building.  I don't know if they knew there was anybody in there.  I don't think...  You know, I think it's part of their job to look around and see if there's anyone in there. 
[01:31:30]  Sure.  See the best way to fight the fire.  But in a maze situation like that, that is textbook, you're screwed.  Right.  When you have, especially one way in and no way out like that.  Well, they could have blocked themselves into something, could have caved in behind them  and cut them off.  It was a real smoldering, smoky fire, so your visibility was really down.  And you've got to understand, as soon as you get inside there, it's pitch dark.  They've got their lights.  That's it, Jimmy.  There's no light coming in from outside sources. 
[01:32:00]  And in heavy black smoke, there's lights don't do shoot.  Heavy black smoke, right.  Don't do shoot.  I think I said it.  Oh, wow.  You said it all right.  Yeah.  I'm impassioned.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  It's so weird.  I've got to just bring up something really fast.  It's like, there's a guy going, you know, not liking the serious tone of the show today.  It's like, do you understand our show?  Show today?  We were, I was doing a Don Imus Reverend Al show earlier.  It's the show today.  So one break we do and it's the show today. 
[01:32:30]  But this is, it's a big story.  The only reason I bring it up, by the way, because we need to educate our own listeners.  Like, you're going to get a lot of different looks with this radio show.  Just because the media tells you that we're a bunch of shock jocks doesn't, it's not true.  We can't talk about something that's important in this area and across the country.  On one given show, we'll get real serious about something and we'll do fart jokes.  That's what, that's the beauty of us.  It's coming back.  Don't worry.  It's amazing. 
[01:33:00]  Some of these people don't get it.  They just want funny, funny, funny, shocking, shocking, shocking.  Pull your head out of the sand.  And don't worry.  You can pull your head out of the sand now.  We got rid of the stuff that you don't want to hear.  There you go.  We'll do a fart joke next, okay?  Just for you.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, baby.  Now, baby is derogatory towards women.  Jesus Christ, Al.  Can I have any part of my show that I used to do?  Uh, no.  Let's ask the almond bus. 
[01:33:30]  Men.  The, uh.  The almond.  A busman.  And get the bus, boys.  I love that song.  Well, you missed it earlier.  We were reading Reverend Al's five steps that Imus needs to do if he's going to be back  on radio.  Five steps to crappy radio.  Five steps to crappy radio.  Five steps to radio no one will listen to.  Five steps to me not doing the Imus show anymore.  Right, right.  He wants, uh, a co-host in here, uh, that can, uh, you know, keep me in check. 
[01:34:00]  So I suggested Reverend Al himself.  That's right.  The Reverend Al and I-Man show.  I'm the A-Man.  You're the I-Man.  You're the, you're the A-hole.  You're stupid.  Yeah, I was going to say, oh, shut up.  Anything you guys want to talk about today there, uh, Imus?  Well, I'd like to, uh, maybe talk about the stock market.  How it's, um, been up and down. 
[01:34:30]  Well, now, wait a minute.  The white man's stock market?  Do you think a brother on the street cares about your stock market?  It, it is offensive to black people.  All right.  Uh.  Maybe we could talk about Hurricane Dean.  Hurricane Dean is, uh.  Might be a Category 5 hurricane there.  Uh, just skirted Jamaica.  Yeah.  I believe in.  Where many brothers have endured much pain.  And now where is, where is the outpouring of support from. 
[01:35:00]  Ah, forget it.  How about the Utah Miners?  Is that something that everyone's talking about today there, Mr. Imus?  Uh, Utah Miners.  Yeah.  Uh, still, uh, trapped or, uh, perhaps presumed dead.  Uh, people injured and killed trying to, uh, recover them.  Miners?  Those are just more white men in blackface.  I am outraged.  Uh, well, you can talk about the number one movie in America.  Superbad. 
[01:35:30]  Superbad.  Try that, uh, I, man.  Uh, Superbad.  Uh, number one at the box office.  I don't go to the movies.  Why not, Al?  Let's have a discussion about this.  Black people make too much noise.  That's offensive.  Yes, but I can say it.  I can say what I want.  I do not want to go to the movies with them s***s making all kinds of s***ing noise. 
[01:36:00]  I want to watch a movie.  And if I complain, I don't want to get s***ed shot.  Now, um, Al, if I said that, there'd be a huge problem.  You're damn right, Cracker.  It's called the double standard.  Double standard.  Can I get Bernard back?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's doing a book signing in Boston, everybody.  Yeah, Thursday night.  I never did one in Boston except with the traveling virus.  So, uh, this is 6 o'clock Thursday at Barnes & Noble on Boylston Street. 
[01:36:30]  Ooh.  And you're going to be doing Toucher & Rich's show, right?  Yes, uh, 4 o'clock.  Those guys are blowing up.  Yeah, they're doing great in Boston.  So, 4 o'clock, I'll be on Toucher & Rich on BCN, our home station up there in Boston.  Which, uh, it was cool last time I was up there, they were on vacation.  Yeah, absolutely.  A lot of people asking for a nephew update.  Eh, don't have much.  The nephew, uh, behaved himself.  Oh, okay.  So I think.  If, uh, if you didn't hear, when we went to Washington, my, uh, my 20-year-old nephew  decided to come to New York with two frat boys, frat friends, and stay in my fine, fine 
[01:37:00]  new pad.  And, uh, I was very nervous because, you know, my pals here, Jimmy and Ant, uh, kind of made  me very, very paranoid.  Well, and, well, we should have.  Describing what was going to happen after our, uh, you know, I, I, I went to Washington.  We, we kind of knew growing up that when, uh, you're left a nice place and the owner  goes away for a while, you're going to abuse it. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You're going to abuse, uh, the, uh, the privilege of being able to stay.  Well, I came back and they had this note because they were gone for the day and they're,  they're thanking me for, uh, the use of the pad and, and, uh, uh, uh, and, and thank you  for, uh, trusting us with your pad.  And I'm like, oh boy, what the hell did they do?  What did they do?  When am I going to find out what they did?  Well, but, uh, just a, just a quick story.  So they did invite this, uh, this, this chick, my, uh, my nephew's good friend from home. 
[01:38:00]  She goes to NYU.  So she's up at, uh, he's up in New York.  So he's like, ah, I want to see my, uh, my, my friend from, uh, home.  So they invite her to the pad.  So the three guys, my nephew and the two frat boys walk into my place with this really hot  college age student and they go upstairs and she proceeds to, uh, you know, take a nap  because she was tired from all the partying they did the night before.  They're all just kind of hanging.  So she, uh, took a little nap on the couch. 
[01:38:30]  No big deal.  Right.  Well, she had to go and, uh, have dinner with some people.  So she leaves by herself.  Now the doorman and all the people in the lobby saw three guys and a hot girl going up to my  apartment.  She leaves by herself.  And because she had a little nap in her, her hair's all askew.  A little must.  And her clothes are a little wrinkled.  So who gave you this, um, description of what happened?  What do you mean?  My nephew.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  Uh, basically the doorman or the, 
[01:39:00]  people downstairs couldn't help themselves.  And they asked if she had a good time.  They are, they were convinced that she was a hooker and you're not.  Yes, I'm not.  Why?  Will you stop making me paranoid?  All right.  I'm just saying.  So you think they actually brought a hooker up to my place?  Why would they give such a detailed story of a, not a hooker coming to, to the house?  Oh my God.  Why such a detailed story? 
[01:39:30]  She came in, she took a nap on the, on the couch.  And that's why her hair was, uh, messy.  Her hair was messy.  We just hung out.  A little wrinkled.  And then she was leaving.  Why didn't someone walk her down?  They didn't.  She walked down by herself.  And, and the doormans basically, I don't remember exactly.  Is she a good friend?  Yeah, I suppose so.  And why wouldn't you walk her?  I met her.  Why wouldn't you walk her down if you're?  I don't know.  But the, the, like the people down in the lobby basically used the, like a term like  toots or something like that.  Toots?  Did you have a good time toots? 
[01:40:00]  Oh boy.  Or something like that.  Because she was leaving the building by herself.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I ain't buying it.  Huh?  No.  Me and Jimmy are kind of questioning the, uh, validity of the story here.  I suspect she was the lady of the evening.  Yeah.  Great.  And then he had to head this off at the pass.  In case the doorman or someone said something to you.  Great.  So he comes up with a story, gives it to you so that when someone says something to you,  you go, no, no, no. 
[01:40:30]  It was a friend and you have all the answers.  And I know the girl that my nephew was talking about because I had dinner with her last time  it came up a year ago and I know she goes to NYU and I've met her when I've been down  in Florida.  He just used that name.  Oh boy.  Get in touch with her.  See if she was over the house.  Unless they called her up to, you know, take care of all the loose ends.  But, well, the weird part is, uh, you might be honest on because like, uh, my nephew showed  me all the pictures from the last three days cause I sent them up nice at Caroline's. 
[01:41:00]  I sent them up with a tour of, uh, NBC studios.  They saw the SNL stage, that whole thing.  They had a really good time.  And then, uh, they were on a bus and a tranny was sitting next to one of his friends.  So they took a picture of that.  So we're going through all the pictures.  Now we know who was up in the house.  So, so we're going through all the pictures and he's explaining, well, this is where,  you know, when we were at Caroline's, you know, uh, sneaking, uh, uh, pictures of the,  uh, comedian cause there's no flash photography there.  So they're taking pictures from under the table.  Greg Proops, matter of fact, who did great once again for Caroline's here in New York 
[01:41:30]  city.  And, uh, then there's about no joke, 20 pictures of these guys in my apartment in all the rooms,  uh, pictures of them with the view and, uh, just everything.  Right.  Not a picture of this girl.  Not one picture of the girl.  Not one picture of the girl.  Who was sleeping on the couch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, just stop.  Really?  You really think they're, they're, they're really?  Nah, come on. 
[01:42:00]  I would.  This is the same kid I used to take to SeaWorld.  Yeah, that's right.  Nah, he would be, he went to SeaWorld too, but only with the letter.  Hey, we got Stormy in Louisiana.  I'm going to change the subject here.  Stormy, what's up?  Um, I'm down on Interstate 12.  All right.  And I'm in a blue metallic Mini Cooper.  Okay.  Oh.  And I'm going to be out here flashing the truckers. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, we got a girl doing a little flashing.  Oh, how about that?  We love that.  Stormy, what kind of boobs you have?  A name like Stormy, I'm going to guess, let me guess here.  I'm going to go with, uh, 38 D's.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  How big are your boobs, Stormy?  Um, they're about 34 C.  Aw.  All right, 34 C.  Those are nice.  But you like showing them off, huh, to all the truckers?  Mm-hmm.  Great.  If they see me, just, just tell them to watch out for me. 
[01:43:00]  Watch out for me.  All right, down there in Louisiana, Stormy's doing the deal.  Oh, and so you were fully aware of what this wow thing's all about, right?  That's right.  All right.  Oh, I love Opie and Anthony.  Oh, well, thank you.  Really, Stormy?  How long have you been listening to us?  Um, for about four years.  Four years?  You sound like you've been drinking a little, Stormy, no?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Are you drinking?  Huh?  Are you drinking?  Am I what? 
[01:43:30]  Have you been drinking?  You sound like you've been drinking a little bit.  Uh, I took two Xanaxes.  Xanaxes.  That's how you know someone's wrong.  Xanaxes.  When they pluralize Xanax.  Xanaxes.  Xanaxes.  Xanaxes.  It's 820.  What made you take the Xanax?  Yeah.  Why two?  I don't know, because I wanted to be, I just wanted to be high.  All right, wait.  All right, wait.  Wait, you've taken two Xanax, and you want to wow truckers.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  There's a shallow grave in your future. 
[01:44:00]  There's a shallow grave in your future, man.  I like the fact you didn't even try to pretend there was a reason.  I'm like, why take Xanax?  No.  I want to be high.  I want to be high.  Hey, you got long nails?  Huh?  You got long nails?  What?  Oh, boy.  How are we going to talk to her?  She really is on two Xanaxes.  How are we going to talk to this broad?

Gosh, she sounds really high.  Oh, Mandy.  Well, everybody calls me Stormylicious. 
[01:45:00]  Stormylicious?  Yuck.  Oh, that's pretty sassy.  Why do they call you Stormylicious?  That sounds pretty salty.  Oh, she's a card, this one.  Yeah.  Why do they call you Stormylicious?  Um, because I'm delicious.  Oh.  And you're Stormy, so you just put them together to save time.  Stormylicious.  Stormylicious.  Ugh.  How old a gal are you, Stormylicious?  I'm 34.  Mm-hmm.

Somebody you carpool with, or...?  No, it's my car.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I just swallowed this, Xanax.  Yeah, exactly.  He's got, like, the rolling around in her mouth.  She had a stroke.  What's his name?  Her, her, her, her.  My car.  My Mini Cooper.  What's his name?  Should I... 
[01:46:30]  Hmm?  Who is he?  Who, the guy behind me?  Yeah, like, how is he related to you?  He's just a friend.  A friend.  And you work together?  Um, no.  He's just riding with me.  Why is he riding with you if you're going to work?  Oh, I'm off today.  I'm just going to Baton Rouge.  Oh, what's in Baton Rouge?  Oh, I'm just cruising for today.  She's like, you figured you'd just pop a few Xanax and drive with a friend. 
[01:47:00]  It's 8.20 in the morning.  You've taken two Xanax with some weirdo in the backseat.  You're driving to Baton Rouge.  In a Mini Cooper.  It's like carjacking him.  And you're showing your boobs as you go.  Yeah.  As she drives, by the way.  That's terrific.  She's wowing people on two Xanax as she drives to Baton Rouge.  Oof.  So are you going to have sex with this guy?  So we tell him to be prepared.  Are you going to have sex with the guy in the backseat?  I don't know.  Why?  What's his problem?  Not my type. 
[01:47:30]  Is he a fatty?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he's fat?  Does he like you?  Look for the Cooper doing a wheelie down the street.  Hey, can you give the phone to the gentleman in the back?  Hmm?  Can you give the phone to the gentleman in the back?  I want to say hi to him.  All right.  Hold on.  I want to say hi to you, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I'm being happy.  Hi.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  Stormy Licious in the front seat, right?  Yeah.  Did you hear her go, mm-hmm, about a minute ago? 
[01:48:00]  Sir?  Did you hear her go, uh-huh, or mm-hmm, about a minute ago?  Yes, sir.  We were talking about you, and we asked if you were gay, and she said, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What?  She said you're gay.  No, I'm not.  Because we asked, like, did she attract it to you?  And she said, yes.  She was attracted to you.  And then we're like, why don't you hook up with him?  And then she didn't want to say.  And then we're like, well, is he gay?  And she's like, mm-hmm.  Like, she's attracted to you, but she thinks you're gay.  I've got two kids. 
[01:48:30]  How can I be gay?  It doesn't matter.  Well, wow.  It's called a beard.  Haven't you seen Oprah lately?  That was so good.  Hey, you tell us too.  Yeah, I didn't take lightly to that.  No.  All right.  So, Stormy, are you attracted to him at all?  Hmm?  Are you attracted to him?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you are?  Then why don't you hook up with him?  Mm-mm.  No?  What's up with your mouth?  Why is it full?  More Xanax? 
[01:49:00]  She just popped another handful.  Huh?  Yeah.  Why, you don't like his body?  Mm-mm.  No?  I don't know.  He's really fat?  Mm-hmm.  Does he know he's fat?  And does he know you think he's fat?  Mm-mm.  How much does he weigh?  More than 250?  Yeah.  300?  Mm-hmm.  320? 
[01:49:30]  Hmm?  Between 300 and 320?  Mm-hmm.  Yuck.  Wow.  You know how bad his bag smells?  Oh, my goodness.  All right, Stormy-licious, I don't think we're going to get much out of you.  We try.  We try here on the Opie and Anthony Show, but you're on your own with the Xanax and the  wowing on the way to Baton Rouge.  It's nice.  A little slice of life right there in that car.  Yeah, absolutely.  Stormy, but you love the Opie and Anthony Show, huh?  Huh?  You love the Opie and Anthony Show?  Do I watch it? 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  Do you love the Opie and Anthony Show?  Oh, my God.  I listen to it.  Yeah.  But you said you loved it.  I know.  My head's screwed.  All right.  I'm right now.  Jim's, well, this is like shooting fish in a barrel, but Stormy.  Mm-hmm?  What do you like about the Opie and Anthony Show?  Oh, man.  She was, she's still going and she'll keep talking. 
[01:50:30]  That was Jim V from Florida.  Opie, please ask her what she likes about the show.  That was, I mean, come on.  Yeah.  That doesn't even count on the stats.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  Tracy.  What?  Hi.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Tracy from Michigan.  How are you, Tracy?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Good.  You've been on hold for about 40 minutes.  What can we do for you today?  Well, I called because I didn't know for sure if I had the right number. 
[01:51:00]  Because I called, you said, be the fifth caller for the CD for music, new music.  And what CD is that?  What CD is that?  What CD is that, Tracy?  To be honest with you, I don't know because I was just coming back into the room.  So if you don't want to.  So wait, wait, you're trying to win a prize?  Wait, you're trying to win a prize on a radio station and you don't even know what that prize is?  I know that it was a new CD for New Music Monday.  New Music Monday, right?  Yeah, New Music Monday.  That's a new feature we're starting up here. 
[01:51:30]  Write it down.  Write it down.  What radio station are you listening to?  What radio station, WKLZ 107.3 out of Grand Rapids?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  WKLZ 107.3, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Now, what type of music are you into there, Tracy? 
[01:52:00]  I like, um, I like, um, metallic, I deserve, heavy metal.  Yeah, heavy metal.  Yeah, I used to go out to, uh, how old a gal are you, Tracy?  46.  46.  So you used to go out when those guys were, uh, touring originally and a lot of the metal  bands were out there and you used to go out there with your leopard skin pants and your  tiger striped jacket and your hair all teased up nice and high and, uh, go out to the clubs  maybe?  No.  No? 
[01:52:30]  Just thinking that was kind of your taste of music and your age.  You know, old broad like you kind of liked going out and, uh, and, uh, you know, capturing  a little part of her youth with that, uh, music like Metallica and some of the older songs.  Tracy?  What do you mean old broad like me?  I'm not old.  No, I said those older songs.  Or broad.  You said old broad like you.  No, no, you misunderstood me, Tracy.  I'm talking about the older songs and what a broad range of songs they were. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, okay.  There you are.  Yes.  Yes.  I got all kinds of music.  I just started listening to.  What kind of panties are you wearing, Tracy?  What's that?  Kind or color?  No.  What kind of panties are you wearing, Tracy?  Hey, Tracy.  Low rider briefs.  Low rider briefs.  Yuck.  Love those.  Love those.  Sexy.  It's yuck Monday.  Sexy.  Yuck.  Ha ha.  Hey, yuck. 
[01:53:30]  Ha ha ha.  Yuck.  Hey.  Why are you wearing those panties?  What?  Tracy, you're too old to be wearing panties like that.  You know that, right?  Why?  You're almost 50.  Low rise briefs.  They go with my low rise jeans.  You wear low rise jeans?  Hey, you let the back of the, uh, jeans down and let your panties show?  No, no, no.  Guys like that.  I don't feel the crack in my ass.  Let's hear.  Why would you do that?  It's like two prunes.  Tracy.  You guys, I can barely understand.  Tracy, you gotta leave that for the young. 
[01:54:00]  I don't leave it.  She's so young.  I'm so young.  I can take it.  I'm still young.  I'm only 45 years old.  Hey, I hear you have low rise j**ts too.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  I get it.  Ha ha ha.  How old are you?  Huh?  27.  How old are you?  Doesn't matter.  We're guys.  All depends on who you ask.  What paper prints it.  Right.  What's your favorite show?  What's your favorite radio show? 
[01:54:30]  I think it's, I just started listening to it this last Monday and I listen to it every  morning.  Who hosts it?  Yeah.  Come on.  Excuse me?  Who are your favorite radio hosts?  Who are your favorite radio hosts?  What do you like about Opie and Anthony, Tracy?  Exactly.  I like that you're like.  What the hell are we doing?  How could she? 
[01:55:00]  I'm young.  Huh?  You're not.  No, you're not.  Don't fool yourself.  Hey, it's good to know we're picking up listeners in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Yeah.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  For a Monday.  Monday.  Ah, Richie from his mobile device.  I love how that comes up on Instant Feedback.  Richie from his mobile device.  How the hell is there a 350 pound guy in the back of a Mini Cooper?  Yeah.  We missed the obvious on that one. 
[01:55:30]  I don't know what a Mini Cooper is.  Oh my God.  It's those little English looking cars that have a lot of little stripes on them.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're tiny little cars.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Or, hey, Opie, I was up at Riley's for dinner on Saturday.  It was great as usual.  Brett is too effing cool.  Wow.  That would be my brother, Brett.  That would be FH Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue.  Stephen S. better be getting, like, free appetizers at this point.  Appetizers?  All right.  Free meals.  What the hell? 
[01:56:00]  Full free meal.  All the good stuff he does for our show.  And then Chris from Vegas, the CD she won.  I'll Be Dumping Your Body in a Shallow Grave by Ed Gain and the Chainsaw Five.  Also, Nick from Boston.  Wow.  How did you guys just get beat?  I was laughing so hard.  All I could think of was, don't forget the cheese on his head.  And the pepperoni on his...  Can you say the end for the thing on the chest? 
[01:56:30]  Probably not.  Why?  And the pepperoni...  Really?  You can't?  Someone check it out, because now I want to play this dumb call from back in the day.  Maybe we can.  He's referencing a call that stopped us in our tracks, because we're not really sure  if we can say the end word for the thing on your chest.  You know, you've got two of them on your chest.  You could say nipple.  You can't.  You just might not be able to say doing anything with them.  Pepperoni?  In any way, shape, or form.  Pepperoni?  I don't know.  What is sexual about that? 
[01:57:00]  It doesn't have to be sexual.  Let's go to Dani.  She's a girl.  She's from Virginia.  What's up, Dani?  Hey, guys.  Ew.  I saw you on Saturday night, and little Jimmy signed my, you know what?  And I was so excited.  I signed your breast or your ass?  Right outside Nissan, you signed my book, and then I came back, and you signed some guy's  left ass cheek.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was awful.  He had a big, horrible ass.  Signed a guy's ass, huh?  I did.  I signed a guy's cheek.  The second one I signed.  You really want to sell those books, don't you?  I'll sign anything. 
[01:57:30]  I'll sign your taint.  He actually, later, we were standing over by where the food was, and he came over, and  he was like, dude, check it out.  And my boyfriend was taking a picture of me and him, and my signature on my tits and his  is on his butt, and he got kicked out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm worried about it.  Really?  Yeah.  He was escorted out by six Nissan people.  They were like, I'm sorry.  You're going to have to go.  I'm like, oh, I'm so glad they didn't see me. 
[01:58:00]  It was after the show anyway, though.  Hey, Danny, what did you like about the show Saturday night?  It's a big comedy show up there in, well, down there in Washington, D.C. area.  You know, Virginia.  Nissan Pavilion.  It was actually.  So we have that call, the.  I can imagine going out with a chick named Danny.  It just, you know, with Danny that we work with, it'd be so hard to have, like, dirty  talk and sex talk with her.  Take it all, Danny, and you mean the alcohol. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, boy.  Like, how could you call out the name of a guy you work with?  Is he doing that paintball thing, or did he do it?  Oh, he did it all right.  Yeah, we'll get into that when Danny returns tomorrow.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, yo, Brett did buy my table dinner.  I was there with Rich W. and H-Cup Jane, so please thank him for me.  That's why my brother can't pay any of his personal bills, by the way, Steven S.  Steve from Bayshore should have gotten free.  The other people pay.  Must pay.  My brother's not paying his personal bills. 
[01:59:00]  He's so generous.  All right, hey, Drew Boogie sent in some Bob Kelly remixes.  Drew Boogie.  We can't get enough of Bob Kelly puking.  And he didn't disappoint during the last time we did.  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  He was puking like crazy.  I've never seen a guy that pukes so much have a belly that big.  You'd think something would come out.  He's anorexic, but normally he puts his fingers down his throat and there's food on his fingers.  And so Drew Boogie took some of Bob Kelly's puking and he did a little remix with Salt-N-Pepa. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  It's quick.  It's like 20 seconds here.  Listen to this.  How good is that, man? 
[02:00:00]  Drew Boogie on it.  Oh, that's good.  Bob Kelly remixes.  Yeah, taking the pukes and...  Sampling his puke sounds.  There you go.  He did it with the Metallica song, too.  Somebody needs to help him. 
[02:00:30]  Somebody needs to help him.  Gets the job done short and to the point.  There you go.  That's what we like on the show.  That's what we like on the show.  So we do have the pepperoni on the thing, and Al says we can play it.  All right.  I haven't heard this in a long time.  It could suck.  I don't know.  It was one of those phone calls, I guess, that we used to...  Oh, back when we were working up there in Massachusetts, we put out a CD called Demanded World. 
[02:01:00]  Got no money for it whatsoever.  You know the story by now.  But we're still proud that it's out there.  And every once in a while, we get to sign one.  Yeah.  People are bringing them to the virus tours.  It's kind of cool to take a look at the old CD we put out.  And, well, we called the Green Bay Pizza Establishment.  And we were making believe we were some hacky radio show in the Green Bay area.  And we were trying to give away Super Bowl tickets.  Right.  Hello?  Hello, Art Bowling.  Wrong number. 
[02:01:30]  Really?  Yeah.  What number did we call?  Sammy's Pizza.  Oh, we were trying to give away Super Bowl tickets to Art Bowling.  Well, give them to me.  What do you think?  It's a little unorthodox.  Am I going or no?  Let's hear how excited you would get.  You sound excited.  You just might be going to the Super Bowl.  No way.  We might go to the Super Bowl.  Go Packers!  Do you have a co-worker there, sir?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Give her the phone.  Okay.  Hello?  Hi, how are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Good.  We're going to give that guy tickets to the Super Bowl, but we're going to make him do something 
[02:02:00]  really stupid for him.  Okay.  All right.  Tell him he's got it stripped out to his underwear right now.  You got it stripped to your underwear right now.  Go.  Hey, that's underwear.  Tell him this is a radio station in Green Bay.  This is a radio station in Green Bay.  Tell him the green.  We got green and gold boxers on.  Really?  Really.  Did he take his shirt off, too?  No.  Tell him to take his shirt off.  Take his shirt off. 
[02:02:30]  That's a shirt off.  Because if you look out the window, we actually have somebody seeing if he's doing all this.  Open your blinds.  This will all come clear in a few minutes.  We're going to have someone run into the pizza parlor with the tickets.  Someone's going to be running into the pizza parlor with the tickets to make sure you did  this.  And we're filming it for the TV station.  So...  We're filming it for the TV station.  What is he down to?  His boxers?  He's down to his boxers.  And you guys work at a pizza place?  He's working at the pizza place.  Can you take a couple of those pepperonis and put them on his nipples?  We want to make them look really silly for the 5 o'clock news tonight. 
[02:03:00]  Can we put pepperonis on your nipples for the 5 o'clock news?  We have our man in the street, Brad Force, is going to be running in with Super Bowl tickets.  And if he looks exactly like we have him set up to look, he will be going to the Super Bowl.  He has to have the pepperoni on?  Pepperoni.  Pepperoni on.  All right, we'll work on it.  Well, hurry up.  Okay.  This is all going down as we speak.  This is unbelievable.  I'm not kidding.  Does he have the pepperoni on his nipples or not?  Just about.  He's got it.  He's running with the pepperoni. 
[02:03:30]  Take some cheese and sprinkle it on his head.  We want to come in and see a cheese head.  Okay.  Hold on just a second.  Paul, you've got to have cheese and sprinkle it on your head.  He needs pepperoni on his nipples.  Don't forget the cheese on his head.  Okay.  We won't forget the cheese.  Put it on your head.  Sprinkle some cheese because he's got to be a cheese head.  You've got to be a cheese head.  Okay.  Okay.  We got the cheese.  All right, ma'am.  Now explain what he looks like right now.  Okay.  We got green and gold boxers.  Okay.  We got pepperoni on the nipples.  Okay.  And cheese on the head. 
[02:04:00]  Very good.  All right.  This is what I need him to do.  This is going to be unbelievable.  We're waiting outside with the TV cameras.  He needs to run outside right now.  You're waiting outside with the TV cameras.  You need to run outside right now.  As soon as he runs onto the sidewalk, the guy's going to be...  Brad Forrest will hand him his Super Bowl tickets.  Okay.  As soon as you walk outside looking like that, you will get handed Super Bowl tickets.  And beyond the 5 o'clock news.  And beyond the 5 o'clock news.  Is he outside?  You know, it's pretty cold out there.  We know that.  That's why we're making him do this.  It's going to make great TV.  Now, is he outside? 
[02:04:30]  You bet.  All right.  Go get the dork from outside.  We've got to talk to him.  This is going to be brutal.  Hello?  Okay.  So you were outside with pepperoni on your nipples, cheese on your head, in your box of  shorts.  Yeah.  Did you see any TV cameras?  No, I didn't.  Sucker!  What the hell are we doing?  Brad Forrest. 
[02:05:00]  What the hell is that?  Brad Forrest.  What the hell is that for?  I don't know.  I just came up with a name.  Know what's sad about that phone call?  Can't do those anymore because the lawyers got in the way.  Yeah.  The lawyers got in the way.  Who actually got hurt during the making of that prank call?  Seriously.  That gentleman did.  He looked like a silly goose.  Who really got hurt?  But the lawyers took that out of our playbook.  We can't do that type of radio anymore because, you know, they're protecting everybody.  Can't do that.  Can't do that.  Even though that was harmless.  Coke Logic. 
[02:05:30]  Someone's saying.  Cigar.  Cigar.  Who got hurt?  The next guy that ordered pepperoni.  It's a hair on my pepperoni.  All right.  Coke Logic sent this in.  Say y'all.  Sean Kingston.  You're way too beautiful, girl.  That's why it'll never work.  You have me.  Suicidal.  You make me suicidal.  But you say it's over. 
[02:06:00]  All these beautiful girls.  They only want to do what you do.  They don't have you.  Suicidal.  You make me suicidal.  When they say it's over.  There you go.  Quickie from Coke Logic.  We did suggest that maybe the listeners will take the edited version of that fine song and put whatever the hell they want in the dead space. 
[02:06:30]  And he figured Don Imus would fit.  Just about wrapping up here.  Let's say hi to Tyler in Detroit.  Hey, Tyler.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  You guys are playing all these clips.  The lady called in or whatever, and you're doing the pepperoni thing.  Can you do the Donna Summers thing for me?  Oh, the Donna Summers.  I'm the Space Shuttle.  The Space Shuttle.  The Endeavor.  The Endeavor.  This one got ridiculous, didn't it?  Yeah, this one is ridiculous.  We could end the show with this.  We're in that weird period where we can't really start anything new because we've got like three minutes left. 
[02:07:00]  We had prize pigs calling us all the time because our phone number matched another station.  They matched all the stations.  And we were constantly getting wrong numbers from people.  All the radio stations in the Boston area were off by one number.  So you just misdialed.  You were going to get another radio station.  We got prize pigs from every radio station in the Boston area.  Yeah.  And they'd call up, and of course, we'd have to figure out what they were calling for and what prize they wanted through clever questioning. 
[02:07:30]  And then we would just rag them.  It was a lot of fun.  Definitely.  Well, this lady was calling up for Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  We'll end this side of the show with this today.  Have a good day.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a 0.5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row for Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece?  A thong?  Bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this. 
[02:09:00]  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No!  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah!  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again.  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle. 
[02:09:30]  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes.  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Is she hanging out finally? 
[02:10:00]  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Ah, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi, exclusive XM audience.  XM Satellite Radio.  And we were at the XM Compound on Friday.  Yes, we were.  A lot of energy down there, man.  They're rocking.  It was a lot of fun to be down there. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, God.  Rats.  Oh, Rats.  Oh, God.  I enjoyed my time at the compound.  I really did.  Yeah.  It was fun.  It's been way too long.  Those guys treated us like kings down there.  Yeah, very nice.  And I walked by our old studio last week.  I forgot to tell you guys.  What's going on over there?  I think I did it on Thursday.  Let's be honest with each other.  We need to start walking again.  Yeah, and this was fun for a while.  Take a little break from the walk.  Yeah, I want to get the fuck out of here.  And do the whole show from one station. 
[02:11:00]  It made it a little easier, but it's time to walk again.  Until it gets cold.  And supposedly, when we get back from vacation, right around Labor Day, that studio is going  to be done and ready to go.  And we'll be ready to walk again.  Vacation?  You guys are taking vacation?  Sorry.  Vacation.  The angry typing guy.  Hey, did anyone else know that the little kid at the end of Forrest Gump, you know who  that was?  Of course.  Yes.  I did not know that.  Wasn't he from Sixth Sense?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Little drunk on the road now.  Little Dewey guy.  What the fuck is his name?  He's not little anymore.  Jolie Osgood.  Osgood.  Yeah, that's...  Conflict Osgood.  Haley Joel Osmond.  Is it Osmond?  People think it's Osmond, but it's Osmond.  Osmond.  It's a T at the end or something.  Osmond?  Osmond.  That Forrest Gump, man.  When it's on, I have to watch.  It is a good movie.  I hated it for years, and I'm like, eh, it's good.  Yeah.  But at the end, I didn't realize he was the little kid going on the bus.  Very little.  I had no clue. 
[02:12:00]  Very little's right.  He could have been more than four years old.  I love when Idiot Forrest asks old AIDS face.  Before he buried her like a fucking German shepherd under a tree.  Instead of fucking springing for a nice plot old dumbbell just digging a shovel.  We can go talk to mama.  Can you?  Can we?  And I wonder if fucking old Sally Field, the old flying nun with cancer, I wonder if she  got the fucking under the tree treatment, too. 
[02:12:30]  She was under a shrub.  Under the tree.  Yeah, you were like, peas and carrots, were ya?  She's like, fucking.  But I like when he asks, he's trying to ask if the kid is stupid, which was kind of sad.  Was that the touching scene?  I thought.  Was that the tear?  I felt when he was talking to her stupid tombstone under the apple tree.  Yeah.  What is that music?  Is that from the movie?  Of course it is, Jim.  I don't remember.  Of course.  It better be.  Iraq's going to get punched.  It's from Steel Magnolias, you idiot. 
[02:13:00]  But no, it's just Iraq, he's having his period.  When he's talking to her, I didn't like that.  I felt that was designed just to yank a tear out of me.  He was like, yeah, I miss you.  Because his voice kept wavering in between stupid Tom Hanks and Accent.  It was like, can you just be the retard in this scene?  Do you have to be Tom and the retard?  And yeah, it kind of annoyed me.  And one thing we did at Accent, which was really cool, is we were out.  And since we were in Georgetown, I wanted to go see The Exorcist.  Oh, God, we didn't even talk about that yet. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, well, it's Friday, we couldn't.  Well, on the other side of the show, that's all.  Because that was a huge highlight, man.  For me, it was a highlight.  And we all know that we do all our really good stuff the first half of the show.  So this is a treat for all the XMers that we forgot to do this break.  See?  I told you, even they know.  On the first half of the show.  Well, I wanted to see The Exorcist steps.  Yeah.  So Friday night, I think we were out on the way back.  If you don't know the steps I mean, it's at the end of the movie when Damien grabs the  little girl and he shakes the little girl and he goes, come into me, come into me. 
[02:14:00]  And he jumps out the window with the devil, the blue or the devil, and he falls down the  steps and breaks his neck.  Well, those steps, obviously, are still there.  And they really are some long, you would be a neck-breaking motherfucker if you fell  out of the steps.  Yeah.  And I got my picture taken on the steps.  But they cheat a little bit.  Like, because The Exorcist's house, there's a house, like, there's a little bit of a lot  and there's the house.  And it's surrounded by a big, like, wood fence. 
[02:14:30]  Not a see-through fence.  Like a scary wood fence.  Killjoys.  Like a scary wood fence.  The fence is even creepy.  You can see, like, the beginning of the driveway.  I'm like, that's where fucking Max von Sydow got out.  But you can't see the house.  So I lifted up the little letter thing and peeked through and it was creepy.  I knew...  Not a light in the house.  There was going to be a car parked.  Or I knew there'd be a little driveway with the front door positioned the way it was in  the movie.  And that's exactly where it was.  So it was definitely the house from the movie.  And when you come around to the side of the steps, where, like, the steps go all the 
[02:15:00]  way down, if you look over the fence, there's a yard and then there's the house.  That's where they cheat a little bit in the movie.  Oh, right.  So you wouldn't be able to...  If Damien just jumped out the window, he would actually, in reality, have just landed  in the yard and had the devil on him like an asshole.  And, you know, he'd have been rolling around in some leaves, him and the old dev, and they  just would have fucking got the key under the welcome mat and came back in and killed  the little bitch.  So I guess they had to cheat so he jumped.  Unless with the devil on you, you jump 70 feet. 
[02:15:30]  Maybe the devil makes you jump faster.  That's true.  So he jumped and he would have fallen in the yard.  He'd cheat a little bit.  And there were people just stopping by the whole time we were there.  Yeah?  Yeah, just getting their pictures taken.  And that movie's what?  Well over 30 years old.  35 years, 34 years old.  That, 1973, that house is fucking creepy.  Yeah, show the house again, Iraq.  And it's definitely...  Come on, Iraq, show the house.  There it is right there.  The first one.  Can you open it up?  I can't see the picture.  That's definitely what we saw, Jimmy.  Yeah, that is the house, man.  Look at the creepy fence.  It looks not as creepy during the day, I guess. 
[02:16:00]  During the day, it's not creepy.  But at night, that house is really, really frightening.  Poor bastards that live there.  Got to put up with assholes like you.  Dude, I could not...  Peeking through the fucking mail slot.  You know what, though?  I could have a shotgun through that mail slot.  You know what, though?  The second I saw a peeper.  If you don't want to deal with it, you could get some fine money for that house and move  somewhere else.  It's not like it's a special house.  It's a shitty brick house in the middle of Georgetown.  Dude, that is where the fucking exorcist was shot.  I don't believe they just did the externals either.  I'm going to guess that they did the entire shoot inside that house. 
[02:16:30]  I'm thinking they did.  I could be wrong.  But it was really creepy.  It's scary to look at, man.  It really was.  And at the bottom of the stairs, it's just a dumb gas station.  Dude, I could...  Which kind of takes away from the whole thing.  I could never live in that house.  I was like, I would really be frightened.  Walking in the dark and walking into that foyer and then up those awful steps, which led  into Reagan's room.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm getting the creeps fucking...  Hello.  They should have... 
[02:17:00]  If I lived there, why don't people have senses of humor that live there?  You could put that sound she made, put that in a little speaker by the mail slot.  So if people are creeped out and you could see them creeped out, just put a sound there.  You've got to go creepier, Ant.  Really?  Yeah.  Someone by the window?  No, you've got to be on the other side of this fence.  So when people are peeking over like Jimmy and I did, you're just waiting.  And they're doing it all night long, so you don't even have to wait that long and just  jump out of a bush and make that noise. 
[02:17:30]  That would scare people.  And film the whole thing and put it up on YouTube and become a YouTube.  A little flash of something in the window.  We should have taken that picture from the side, man.  Yeah.  That was fucking...  Dude, it was dark.  That one that came out, we would have had to come back during the day.  At least the stairs were lit up.  This wasn't lit up at all.  I could never walk into that house in the dark.  You know what would be really creepy, those of you, you put your cock by the mail slot  and then every time someone looks at them, they just see your cock staring at them.  And they're like, yeah, that's the house.  Let's go.  It would just wreck their fucking...  Hey, we got one of the stars of the big show this past Saturday night down there in  Virginia at the Nissan Pavilion. 
[02:18:00]  Everyone had great sets.  Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Saget.  Ah.  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up, Bob?  How are you, sir?  Hi, Bob.  I love staying there and I love that show.  I stayed in that Exorcist house when I came in to do the show.  Huh?  I just stayed in the house, the Linda Blair house.  How was it?  That's what you guys were just talking about.  We're...  Yeah, we are.  We are.  We are.  I was saying that's where I slept when I came in to do the O&A show at the Nissan Pavilion.  And I'm like...  And I'm thinking, is he kidding or is he fucking around? 
[02:18:30]  Like, is he serious?  No, I'm not staying there, man.  I couldn't...  I'm such a...  Yeah, no.  This is how dumb I am.  He was just trying to relate, Jimmy.  I'm hoping that Bob maybe knew it was this really weird inn that you could stay at.  I was actually getting hopeful.  It's a bed and breakfast now?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought you were serious for a second.  Hey, Bob.  I actually asked Bob Saget to call for a very different reason today.  Yeah?  Backstage at the show, we were talking a little bit.  And he went to the Walter Reed Hospital down there in D.C.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And how he described it, I just felt like you needed to call the show and talk about it 
[02:19:00]  a little bit there, Bob.  Yeah, it was really...  I can't get it out of my head, actually.  Yeah, we were offered to go, and I guess timing-wise, things didn't work out.  They wouldn't need us for over two hours, but we had to leave and get to the venue early.  We had to leave really early.  I was thinking to myself, believe me, I am 100% back in the troops, but I don't know  if I could take it as a human being walking in there and seeing some of the stuff that's  going on in the hospital. 
[02:19:30]  I feel bad.  I don't like hospital shows.  I can't watch ER, never mind stepping into a place and watching a war-wounded and having  to talk to him.  It would really be kind of oof.  Yeah, Bob was really affected by this whole thing.  I wouldn't want to go with Bob just because he's so much more famous than all of us.  And they'd be like, hey, Bob Saget and you assholes.  And a couple dummies.  No, they would have been happy to see you.  They would have known.  They would have been really happy, actually.  It was weird because I met about 10 people, a dozen people, one young lady and a bunch 
[02:20:00]  of guys.  And I guess they screened.  They selected.  They probably didn't want me to come into a room where you'd see someone just getting  back and not just totally out of it.  Oh, because they were pretty well adjusted with their injuries?  I mean, it was a guy who, you know, three days ago, three days ago, had lost his legs. 
[02:20:30]  And, you know, a bomb going off on the ground as he's walking.  Or a shrapnel getting thrown.  Or a couple different people were just getting drive-bys.  And it was, you know, I've been through this stuff before where you meet people that have  had terrible things happen to them.  You know, like, I'm on the board of Starlight, Starbright, so you see sick kids and stuff.  But when you go in, it's completely different.  It's just completely different.  All the staff is in fatigues. 
[02:21:00]  And everyone's very kind and very appreciative.  But they're also very careful over there, you know.  Yeah, they want the wrong impression going out the door.  I'm sorry?  They wouldn't want the wrong impression going out the door, you know.  Yeah, I would think that.  I would gather.  They kept me away from the containers of drugs.  Didn't you have a guy, didn't you see a guy with, like, no legs and he was trying to  tell you that he's okay, he's okay?  And you could tell he was in shock still?  I, I, I, there was a, there was one guy who really wasn't, you know, I don't know how 
[02:21:30]  you can find out that that's how you are and you are okay.  And he was thinking about his future, thinking about going home.  The thing that really made me the most inspired was this young lady that had saved another  guy who was down the hall who I met with.  And he was just saying how much he loved her and revered her.  And she was going to go work in a, in a correctional facility, an all women's correctional facility. 
[02:22:00]  So I'm like, oh really?  Uh, cause I have a girlfriend, but I'm looking for somebody great.  Do you think, you know, you can get me somebody at the correctional facility, you know, somebody  who'll be really strict and not let me get out of line.  So you're trying to make jokes over there.  That's a tough audience.  Yeah.  That is a real tough audience.  And, uh, they liked it.  I mean, they liked that people don't stop looking them in the eye and stuff, you know? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  But these weren't pathetic people.  All of them were, um, and that's probably the other thing is I was teed up that I would  meet people that were, uh, positive people.  They're, they're patriotic people.  They don't, they, I didn't get into politics, obviously.  You know, I asked, I asked one person, do you think we shouldn't be over there?  And they're like, well, I'm not going to answer that really, but, but I am going to tell you  that it didn't feel like I was making much of an imprint with what I was doing. 
[02:23:00]  And, uh, other people felt that, you know, they wanted to be back there.  Most of them missed their friends who they became very close with, you know, I've been  with those people for four years.  I feel like I left them.  I should not have left them.  I feel terrible about that.  And it's just, that's why people that have, you know, they've lost parts of their, their  bodies and, um, pretty good work done to them. 
[02:23:30]  You know, that's why I say carpet bomb them, carpet bomb the enemy.  Just go in.  And then that way we get our guys back, uh, all in one piece.  Mm-hmm.  Cause quite frankly, I really don't care how many pieces, uh, the other, the other team's in.  And, you know, that's what it's, uh, that's what it amounts to.  Uh, I don't care.  If carpet bomb the enemy, do we go over and visit them and do stand-up and stuff?  No, they have to have their own comedians and television stars and things like that.  Like, uh, Iraq's, or Iraq's funniest home videos guy, the host of that, can go over there and 
[02:24:00]  play a bunch of bloopers from Saddam accidentally shooting somebody he didn't mean to shoot.  Or it's the guy who did all of Al-Zar Kawi's beheading videos.  Yeah.  With all the bloopers they had.  Look, the knife wasn't sharp enough to redo it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Just add the laugh track and the wacky music.  And the boing.  Yeah, the boing.  You need the boing.  And then even there, I'm sure getting hit in the balls is funny.  Yep.  And then when Saddam hangs, I could voice that over. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  I think, yeah.  Well, that's gotta hurt.  You could run it backwards.  Well, I won't leave you hanging, but we got some bills to pay.  Boy, at last, I was well hung.  Yeah.  Let's see how many carpet bombs go off for these kids.  Oh my God, Bob.  You do want a career, don't you?  What's wrong with that?  You gotta keep that family image going a little bit.  You're like, ah, screw that. 
[02:25:00]  No, no, no.  This is the new Bob Saget.  Hey, Bob, you coming in this week?  I am.  I'm gonna come in and we're gonna hang out.  I'm gonna visit you live on Friday.  Cause the next night is when we're in Holmedale.  Yep.  Yeah.  Holmedale, right?  Holmedale.  We're almost done with this tour, Bob.  What do you think so far?  I think I'm waiting till the very end of it.  And then I'm gonna start shooting up.  Nice.  I think it's great.  Find him in his trailer.  How many people...  Bathtub.  I'll tell you the sick part.  I'm hanging out with Louis C.K. and Carlos Mancilla back afterward at the hotel after the gig. 
[02:25:30]  And I never do this anymore.  I just didn't go to sleep.  We were telling our little comedy war stories all night.  Aw.  Yeah, you guys started that shit like when we were standing backstage.  And I was horrified and laughing my ass off at the same time with some of the comedy stories these guys have.  The behind the scenes shit, the road trips, the asshole fucking agents, the clubs, the bad audiences playing in front of like...  One of the funniest was talking about playing in front of some of those all black audiences where you let a joke out and you just hear one guy go, 
[02:26:00]  Oh no, uh-uh.  And you sit there just horrified like, Oh my God, what the fuck now?  Now what do I do?  Bring back the brother.  Yeah.  Bring back the brother.  And you're sitting standing there like, Okay, how much time do I got?  Yeah, that was gonna be a long night.  I had an audience.  I won't do it.  Let the man speak.  And the other person said, No, bring out another brother.  Get him off the stage.  Let Bob talk.  And I'm like, Oh shit, I'm really sorry. 
[02:26:30]  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to make you guys laugh.  And then I like run away.  Run away from the situation.  I don't know how you guys do it.  But that was after a year of going up to the same fat Tuesday at the old comedy store in the main room every week.  And I was kicking ass thinking, Oh man.  I'm accepted.  I'm the only white guy that can kick ass here.  I'm the coolest.  And then the riot starts one night.  I don't do ethnic shows.  I won't do all Asian shows or all Latin shows or gay shows or black shows. 
[02:27:00]  I don't like them.  I think it's just self-centered and self-obsessed.  But both people or the shows?  Both.  No, I just don't like any themed comedy show.  Typically, I detest.  Because if you had it themed where people weren't included, they would cry.  I mean, they put on white comics and stuff, but it just annoys me.  Yeah.  Rich Voss was on stage.  It's like Apollo.  If you're funny, you're funny.  Why do you have to make...  I don't get the whole theme thing.  Right.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yo, Devin, what's up? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Me.  I'm leaving.  Have a good time.  And you're like, I was at Walter Reed saying that.  Yeah.  I've learned a lot this summer about you guys.  I don't know how you do it.  Like, Ant and I, we're doing, what, eight tour stops?  And we're done.  And we do most of the very light lifting.  We're not out there really doing, you know, too much.  I don't know how you do it, night after night.  And we got a cool atmosphere.  We're in front of anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 people. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  So it's a lot of fun.  You feel the energy.  You guys are traveling day after day into shitholes on the way up.  I don't know how you did it.  Not me.  I mean, I come in.  No, not you.  No, Bob.  Jeez.  Yeah, yeah.  You actually have had.  I visit hospitals and sick children, and then I come do you guys.  Yeah.  No, I love doing.  You know, what's weird is I'm not in a place where I'm going up after comedian after comedian,  and it's a large venue, and everybody's getting their, you know, they're like tigers pacing backstage.  But then it turns all fruity. 
[02:28:30]  It's like, oh, Jim, it's so good to see you, man.  Yeah, we really are.  Just a bunch of you just happy to be surviving this fucking homos.  There's a gentleman backstage just hugging.  Oh, it's so good.  Then on stage, you know, rawr.  You know, just being a filth bag.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really not what you'd want it to be, just hardcore guys going, yeah, you know  what?  Fuck those people.  I know a lot about women.  You'd think observational bits were being discussed.  It's like, man, that Anchorage thing almost killed me. 
[02:29:00]  Me too?  Why don't we go out for some soup?  Yeah.  Do you know how depressed people would be if they were backstage and just saw what a  bunch of fucking Moe's we are standing around chit-chatting and eating pretzels?  Oh, too many carbs.  Are there any carrot sticks?  Just a bunch of douchebags trying to watch our weight.  Anyone have a protein bar?  I'm going on stage in a half hour.  I need a protein bar.  Not Bobby.  What'd you say, Jimmy?  Bobby Kelly looked like he's CGI when he walks in.  He doesn't look like a real person anymore. 
[02:29:30]  He looks CGI.  Well, the funniest thing, I think Jimmy pointed out, Bob Kelly came on to the song Beautiful  People by Marilyn Manson.  We started laughing our asses off backstage.  And he walks like Elvis in 77.  He's walking on stage to Beautiful People.  Elvis in 77.  Left foot, shake.  Right foot, shake.  Left foot.  It's awful.  It's like he's doing a caricature.  And he was goofing on my shirt last location. 
[02:30:00]  We were at Detroit.  His shirts are, the print on him has gotten to the point where it's got to be so big to  cover up his belly that it's now a life-size version of the Sistine Chapel, I think was  the last one he wore.  He's just wrapped himself in print where you cannot possibly see, or he's trying to cover  up the big belly.  Dude, I blew it for everyone because I was on with the Junkies before you and I went on.  And I saw Rich Voss in the catering tent and he was wearing a shirt. 
[02:30:30]  It was a light, it was a thunderstorm on his shirt with the bolt of lightning and trees.  It was a whole dark shirt with a lightning bolt.  And I couldn't wait to just beat him up on the radio with the Junkies because one of the  Junkies said that he used Rich Voss's dressing room to take a shower.  And I went, well, what'd you do?  Just stand under Rich's shirt?  And Rich went, oh boy, he changed his shirt two minutes later.  And I'm like, fuck, I wrecked it for everybody.  I don't need the distractions.  Dude, this would have been hours of fun backstage and I ruined it for everybody, so I apologize. 
[02:31:00]  He should give us a picture of the shirt so we can at least put it up on the website,  how ridiculous it was.  Bunch of insecure assholes.  Did you see Patrice O'Neill in shadowboxing for Louis C.K. before he went on?  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's really good.  He holds his hands up and they're just kind of like working out.  It's because of some camaraderie.  I swear to God, you've got to break this shit up.  Could you find two more out of shape people to be doing shadowboxing? 
[02:31:30]  Fucking Patrice and Louis?  I pace around like a fucking idiot before I go on.  And then they play that music.  I think I'm walking out like I'm Peter Frampton.  I just walk around a little bit, get the energy going.  I really don't want to be talked to right before.  You know, we all have our little things.  But I mean, I'm not too intense, but you know, you have to focus a little bit.  Some guys walk around like, all right, man, like, whoa, artist at work.  Shut up.  You know, all right, douche, we get it.  You're deep and it's going to be a tiger, like you said, you know. 
[02:32:00]  I just try to walk around and focus.  Jim, I felt terrible.  I opened up your dressing room door thinking it was mine.  And I kind of didn't knock, guys.  What did you say?  I opened up the door and it's Jim sitting there on his laptop and I was just so glad.  I said, I'm so glad there's nobody else in here with you, man.  He goes, I'm just glad I wasn't jerking off.  Do you understand how tempted I was to jerk off in the trailer by myself?  I was bored.  And I'm like, I got to jerk off a little bit.  And I just didn't.  I was like, yeah, I was going over this thing I got to do.  So I'm like, yeah, let me just focus on something else.  And I'm really happy I didn't because I really wanted.  I would have walked, Bob would have just walked in and seen me jerking off. 
[02:32:30]  And I just walked out.  Come over.  He's probably about 10 minutes away from going on.  It's nice, mature shenanigans that go on because who threw their ass through our window?  Well, that was Keith, wasn't it?  Keith.  Yeah, we had a window open a little bit to get some fresh air.  And I look over, I hear the blinds rattle a little.  And there's just a bare ass coming through the window.  You're sitting there going like, we're all adults.  You realize it's Bob Kelly just peeking in?  Well, the Bob Kelly peeking in scared the hell out of your girl. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  She's two days out from gallbladder surgery.  She makes a trip to Washington, D.C.  She's in the dressing room.  Yeah, she's laying on the couch.  Laying on the couch just trying to, you know, hang out.  Bob shoves his fat head through the blinds and goes, ah!  I was kidding.  There's a crap out of everybody.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Sorry, Jim.  That was a great audience that night.  That was great.  Yeah.  D.C. rocked.  Every stop has rocked.  Yeah, it's been amazing.  And I know the next two are going to be crazy.  And then it's going to be over.  How about the guy that won Car Crash Comedy? 
[02:33:30]  Check it out.  Seton Smith.  He was very funny.  Seton Smith was very nice.  Yeah.  He got in and he got out.  It was really good.  He was very humble.  What did Voss call it?  Car...  What did he call it?  What?  Card Crash.  Oh, there you go.  He said, let's hear it for the winner of Card Crash Comedy.  Let's hear Car Cash Comedy.  He just...  Voss shouldn't talk for a living.  He's too dull.  He's a mush mouth.  It's amazing.  It's got to be said.  Voss opened the show and destroyed.  He always does.  I know. 
[02:34:00]  But people confuse the issue.  We like making fun of him.  He can't speak.  We love killing him on the radio show.  But he went out there and destroyed the world of the show.  Pluralizes things that don't need it.  He doesn't put an S on the back of words that do it.  He's retarded.  Yeah.  But he kills.  How about Johnny Fairplay backstage?  Johnny Fairplay from Survivor.  Who?  Boy, does he know how to get under people's skin.  Yeah.  He's a huge fan of the show, too.  What?  What was he doing back there? 
[02:34:30]  Nothing.  Probably lying.  Lying.  He was hoping that someone would recognize him.  Yeah.  From his 15 minutes of fame.  I was about to go on.  I didn't know what it was.  I thought it was a point.  Oh, boy.  And he told me what's going on with Survivor.  Oh, man.  I'm chomping at the bit to get a headline.  Just say it.  To get a headline on TMZ.com.  Just say it.  Boy, am I chomping at the bit.  Is it true, though?  He had a story for everything, this guy.  Just say it.  He told us a story about banging a midget.  Jimmy and I, we were...  You ever hang out with a person and they're telling a story and you know it's such a fucking lie? 
[02:35:00]  No.  I never heard of it.  Shoot the hostage.  Oh, we could get into this today.  So Johnny Fair plays to tell him this long, drawn-out story about banging a midget.  And Jimmy and I were like...  You know how you get itchy under your skin and you can't itch the itch?  Yeah.  It's called embarrassment.  Yeah.  We started getting that feeling like, oh, my God.  I can't even fake that this is real anymore.  It's like the energy is too much.  Like, yeah, man.  And then I go home with this midget and we're doing this. 
[02:35:30]  And then she showed me her pussy.  And then she's like, you know, why don't you fuck me?  And I'm like, that's gross.  And I'm like, that didn't happen.  It just didn't happen that way.  You might have gotten blown by a midget.  I would believe if you said like, ah, chick was like 4'11 and she blew me in the broom closet.  That I would buy.  There you go.  Short and sweet.  Whatever they try to build a story like it's a crazy class.  It didn't happen.  Yeah.  He's a liar.  Like your old pal there.  He's a compulsive liar.  Oh, what? 
[02:36:00]  Like Jimmy?  Who?  Jim Laird.  Oh, Laird.  Well, Laird told a great story in the, in our, where the hell was that?  The office over at NEW.  And it was how he was going to be an air marshal.  And he goes, they gave him a test.  This is, you know, I guess after 9-11, right?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  We're still on the air.  Because it was the whole air marshal thing was pretty huge.  And he goes to give him a little test and made him stand up. 
[02:36:30]  And one of the guys given the test took one of the people, they were in this mock-up of  an airplane, and took a woman and grabbed her by the neck and goes, now, what do you do?  What do you do?  And no one knew what to do.  So Jim just kind of stands up and goes, I'll tell you what you do.  You shoot the hostage.  And the instructor turned around and said, you are right.  Because that's what you do.  And we were all standing there kind of like, no, no, you don't.  First of all, that was in Speed, I believe. 
[02:37:00]  That scene was in Speed.  He's getting his answers from movies, from action flicks.  And no one would say that.  No, they wouldn't.  They might say, shoot the perpetrator.  But you're going to have to shoot the perp anyway.  So why would you just kill the hostage?  Kill the hostage for another.  Aim for the head.  If you hit the hostage, oh, well.  If you hit the perp, you killed him, and the hostage is fine.  Why would you aim for the hostage?  Because it takes the hostage out of the equation.  I understand.  But you could take the person out. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  And if you get sloppy when you're shooting, it doesn't matter.  Because you're supposed to take out the hostage anyway.  Take out the pilots.  You shoot all the hostages and give in to their demands.  That guy's good.  It was one of the times, though, where it was me and Jim.  I looked at Jimmy Norton.  And we were just like, oh, my God.  The bullshit detectors were going off.  That's Jim Laird.  I mean, that's Laird.  I don't want to waste my info because I want to get the headline.  If TMZ.com calls us, we'll give them a headline. 
[02:38:00]  That's how we do it.  You're going to say what Johnny Fairplay said.  Backstage.  Spoilers for the new season of Survivor.  Absolutely.  Absolute ridiculous spoiler.  But TMZ has to call us.  Because, you know, we're not wasting this info where it's out there  and then we don't even get credit for it.  Kind of like the chocolate rain thing.  Eh, we kind of started that phenomenon.  I think the black guys started it.  So this is what we do.  We wait for TMZ to call us and then we give them what Johnny Fairplay told us backstage 
[02:38:30]  at the Nissan Pavilion.  That's what we do today.  That's what we do now.  That's how we do it.  See, we're learning.  Hey, Bob.  We'll see you, what, Friday?  Friday morning.  I'll be in studio.  We'll be pumping your HBO special.  We'll be pumping your appearance at the PNC.  Thanks for all that.  Maybe we can have lunch.  It's going to piss some people off at special, I think.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, you're on this Saturday?  What?  You're on this Saturday?  Yeah, it comes on the 25th.  Oh, cool, man.  Really cool.  Holy shit, that means Jimmy's is right around the corner at this point.  Mine's not until October. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  So this is this Saturday at 10 o'clock?  Yeah.  I can't wait to see you as Jimmy.  It's going to be soon.  Yes.  All right, Bob.  I know it's early where you're at, but we wanted you to call in about that Walter Reed  stuff.  Yeah.  I saw a different side of Bob Saget.  You kind of looked shell-shocked yourself when you made it backstage at the show.  Right now, just even connecting with it really fucks my head up because they're such good  people.  I mean, they're just, and they're like, you don't even expect it.  You don't even expect they're smart.  You know, they seem smart.  Yeah.  I saw a different side of Bob Saget. 
[02:39:30]  It was his ass.  He finally gave it up.  Mike.  Then I went in the story room with the midget.  Yes.  I'm tired of taking Bob Saget's cock.  Bob Saget's cock.  That's the name of my Reader's Digest story.  All right, Mr. Saget.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you on Friday.  Bye.  All right.  There he goes.  Bob Saget.  Jay in DC.  What's up?  Right back to sleep.  There he goes.  You shoot the hostage.  Supposedly it was in Passenger 57.  Oh, was it Passenger 57? 
[02:40:00]  I don't know.  What, Jay?  I just want to tell Bob absolutely how funny that guy is.  You guys put on one of the greatest shows I've ever seen in my life.  Of course.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, Jay.  Yeah, man.  I tell you what, dude.  You got to come back to the state theater.  You're absolutely one of the funniest people I've ever heard.  Oh, thank you, man.  Jay, help us out as far as the O&H on the Virus Comedy Show goes.  What are people going to get from Bob Saget that they didn't realize?  I just absolutely have.  AIDS.  Bob's very dirty potty mouth. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  I didn't see that one coming.  I didn't either, actually.  I thought you were going to go with the, what did you like about Bob Saget?  All right, we're going to sit around and wait for TMZ now.  I'm a little different.  That's what we do.  TMZ, give us a call.  They ain't going to call.  Give us a call.  You didn't call me.  TMZ, you didn't call me.  Look, I'm dancing.  That's from a stupid dopey friend dancing on the bridge.  Look, Tony, Tony.  Look at me, look at me, look at me, Tony. 
[02:41:00]  Look at me.  Now, come down from there.  Come down.  You're going to hurt yourself.  Did he jump or fall?  I think he fell, but he was a douchebag.  He's there with his big platform shoes.  Yeah, call me.  And he was kind of walking and he just kind of fell over.  Do you know how many friends I want to dance on the bridge?  Dance on the bridge, you idiot.  I would drop Voss off and have his suit pressed.  He wanted to be one of the cool guys.  Look at me, look at me, Tony.  Look at me.  No, come down.  You're going to hurt yourself. 
[02:41:30]  And then when they went to fight the Puerto Ricans, and they drove the car through the front  of the Puerto Ricans' clubhouse, and he pulled the car out and just sat outside.  We could have gotten killed in there.  What do you mean, we?  I need to see you in there.  Double J.  Double J was a tough guy.  Double J.  Yeah.  Huh?  Huh?  Cigarette?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah.  Do you know people actually videotape and take pictures of themselves carrying paint  cans down, uh, E-Rock knows this. 
[02:42:00]  He lived in Brooklyn.  You'll find that out if you live in Brooklyn for a while.  What?  You actually see people walking down, uh, what, 3rd?  Yeah, you go down 3rd.  Yeah.  Where are the, uh...  Well, this goes back to getting a picture.  Or, you know...  In famous locations.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, where the hardware shop used to be, across the street is now a Costco.  So there's thousands of people there, and once in a while, you're coming up 3rd, and  you see somebody with a paint can or a bucket.  Yeah.  Walking down the street.  And they're swinging it, and someone's taking pictures of us. 
[02:42:30]  I'm a douche.  I'm just like Tony Manero.  I'm such a douche.  The first time we went to L.A., and Chris, who, uh, Chris Walsh.  Chris Walsh?  He saw us at Mohegan Sun.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Is his last name Walsh?  I think so.  He, uh, now runs a rock station in Worcester.  He's a good guy, man.  He, uh, he left the Hillman show, and he's doing right, but he's doing well for himself.  Uh, when we were in L.A., me and him went to where, you know, O.J. lived. 
[02:43:00]  O.J.?  And, uh, what a douche.  I decided to get a picture in front of O.J.'s house, but I, I felt like I had to have a  serious face.  Oh.  Oh.  Did we see that?  Oh, I want to see that picture.  I can, I can find it, yeah.  Oh, seriously.  I got it somewhere.  But I felt like...  You on Rockingham?  I was in, yeah, Rockingham, and we were in front of the house, like, on the corner  of there, and, uh, we got a picture.  I'm serious, man.  But I felt like, you know, I gotta, I gotta be serious about this.  You should've laughed.  Yeah, what the fuck was I thinking, man?  Bring knives with you.  Yeah.  I was doing a video. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, I was like, here's a, here's a dope doing what Ann's talking about.  It's actually Anthony.  Part of your rod gun video.  That was an entry, entrance video we played before we went out on stage.  Yeah.  Look at Anthony's afro.  Jeez.  Yes.  That's actually before Saturday Night Fever.  That's the amazing point.  That was just the way Anthony dressed.  I invented it.  Hoo-hoo.  And then, uh...  Can I tell you something?  You haven't aged that much, man.  Oh, yeah.  It's just the hairstyle has changed.  More gray.  The hairstyle changed.  That's it for you.  Gray beard.  Call me Gray Beard the Pirate. 
[02:44:00]  Every, every gray hair in this beard is attributed to a check I had to write.  Arr.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, boy.  Oh, well.  Maybe you should've stopped the video before this.  Yeah, before that, because, oh, what I, throw up.  Am I actually seeing you beat up your, uh, your ex-wife there?  That's drama.  It's in a video.  See, and then I, I walk into the...  It's hard to see, because there's a stupid watermark on it.  Yeah.  Oh, there is.  Yeah.  Oh, Foundry owns this now.  Yeah, all of a sudden, your video that you made 15 years ago is now Foundry Music. 
[02:44:30]  I couldn't find a pizza slice.  Steve's got to chill the fuck out.  So I used a taco.  How is this a Foundry Music video?  How is it even a Foundry Music video?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Steve.  Steve.  Look at the bit on the bottom.  What is that?  It's a big Foundry Music.  This is, this is years before Ant and I met.  Years.  My God.  How are you taking fucking crap from one of Anthony's old band videos? 
[02:45:00]  What am I being yelled at for, first of all?  Why are you putting the Foundry watermark logo and the little Foundry thing on the, where  the ticker would be on the bottom, on my Rotgut, uh, uh, Stayin' Alive video, where I'm  Tony Manero.  Oh, who knows, man?  That was, oh, who knows, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, phone to the  air, phone to the air.  You were playing Pendulum during this.  Oh, wow, that was, yeah, that was probably five years ago.  I was watermarking everything back then.  Five years ago.  2001. 
[02:45:30]  Six years ago.  I watermarked that.  Six years ago you watermarked this, and this video is probably 15 years old.  Look at that.  Yes, and then I, I get snot on it.  I wouldn't even know where the original one of that is, to be honest with you.  Well, you can find, uh, that video somewhere.  I think my brother's actually, um, selling old, uh, Live at the Apollo CDs.  Really?  We made a CD called Live at the Apollo, and you would assume that it was at the Apollo  Theater, but no, we're all in blackface standing in front of an Apollo rocket. 
[02:46:00]  See, get it?  We're live at the Apollo.  Hold on.  I liked it.  It was funny.  A lot of people thought it was very funny.  Hold on.  See, and then I'd walk up on the stage, and they would show me walking up behind, and  then the curtain would open, and the whole band would be there.  And then we'd, we'd, you know, rock out.  Good old Frank Cariola's place.  Dressed, uh, just like that when the curtain opened.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  There you go.  Let's go to Brian in Nebraska.  It's, uh, Brian.  What's up, Brian?  Brian.  Brian!  How you doing, guys?  Hi.  First of all, let me say, little Jimmy, I got a thousand copies of your book in the  back end of this truck.  Thank you.  And, uh...  Dude, no, you don't understand.  He's hauling your book as we speak to him, Jimmy.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so you just said casually, thank you.  Oh, the guy is responsible for getting your best-selling book to the bookstores.  Oh, sorry.  What are you doing?  That book sucks.  I'm 61 years old and it had me giggling like a little schoolgirl. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, thank you, man.  I love it, Jimmy.  Thank you, mister.  Uh, uh, you guys are the best.  And I don't know why that little, during the commercial, you had that thing about, uh,  you in the hotel with a husband and wife and they were banging in front of you.  Why in the hell didn't that get the book?  Oh, do you mean, though, I'm not getting much to replay on XM, when I jerked off in  Lancaster in a suit and watched a couple fuck?  I don't know.  I, I, I didn't, uh, there's so many stories.  Well, you know, you got to save a little for the, the next one. 
[02:47:30]  Okay.  Book two.  Jimmy's definitely going to have a next one now because of the sales.  Hey, so where do you haul these to?  Like the main boarder's office or?  Yeah.  No, no.  Yeah.  That's, that's exactly what's going on.  I'm on my way to Reno and, uh, I'm heading to a DC.  I've got two ends of the spectrum.  I've got Harry Potter and I've got Jimmy.  Wow.  How big a difference can that be?  Not as much as you'd think.  Um, Dumbledore was actually a woman I met who turned out not to be a woman.  You know.  Dumbledore.  Thanks guys. 
[02:48:00]  I love the show.  And, uh, fuck you.  You're not getting me with that.  Uh, what if I like this?  Hi.  Thanks.  What is this way?  If his truck got stuck in the mud, which books would he use to put under the tires to  get himself out?  He may do that even if there is no money.  Just run Jimmy's books over.  Wait.  Oh God.  The Harry Potter books.  Hmm.  I was going to pick Brian for my gag.  I knew he was on to us.  Hey, Car Crash Comedy is returning to the Opie and Anthony show this week.  That guy in Philly. 
[02:48:30]  What the fuck?  Steve talked to him today.  Problem.  Problem.  Uh, what was his name, Jimmy?  Why don't we get him on the list?  Ed McGonigal.  You can't.  He works.  You can only get him from like 6 to 6.15.  He's avoiding everybody for the most part.  Steve talked to him for 10 minutes.  Let me just set this up really fast.  We did Car Crash Comedy in Philly.  The big show at Camden is going to end the tour this year and we're hoping for a massive  turnout.  And I think we're going to do two days of broadcasting in Philly and really hype the show.  I think, uh, Is Tom Alive?  He's going to be on the stage making his first public appearance and we got a special things 
[02:49:00]  planned for, for Camden.  And, uh, this guy won Car Crash Comedy.  He's a short little fella.  He can't be more than 4'8".  Little fella.  And he's got a, like a horseshoe hairstyle.  He's just a mess, but he's really funny.  And he won Car Crash Comedy, hands down, and he's backing out.  And his first excuse was, you want to get paid because, you know, he's putting his material  out there.  Uh, that was one, that's one excuse I heard.  I don't know if it's true.  We got to, we got to get to the bottom, let's get him on the phone. 
[02:49:30]  And now you talked to him for 10 minutes last night.  What happened?  I talked to him for, yeah, for about 10 minutes last night.  And, um, he said, it's not about the money.  He said, and his quote was, I'm at the twilight of a very mediocre career, and I really think  this would be, uh, better suited for a younger guy who's up and coming.  And I said, Rich Voss isn't doing the shows?  And that's exactly the, the analogy, the example I used.  I said, well, Rich Voss did Last Comic Standing.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why would, the example you should have used was Rodney Dangerfield.  Oh, fair enough. 
[02:50:00]  Well, Rodney's not on our shows.  I think he's trying to find someone.  I was trying to find, I was trying to find an example.  I'm just saying, why would a comedian think that he's at the end of his career?  The guy, how old was he?  Like, mid-40s, maybe?  Rodney didn't get started until he was in his 50s, man.  That's when he got discovered.  He got discovered.  Rodney was, was doing comedy for years.  He wasn't getting anywhere.  So he quit and went back to Aluminum Siding for 10 years, and then came back and became  the Rodney we all knew.  Mm-hmm.  Had a massive career starting somewhere in his early 50s, I believe.  Yep.  What the fuck's wrong with this guy?  Here's the problem. 
[02:50:30]  He's scared.  He's scared shitless, right?  Ed is scared, um, and he doesn't want to do it.  So, okay, don't do it.  I'm not going to beg somebody to go on stage.  You don't want to go on stage in front of X amount of 1,000 people.  You want money?  You want, bye.  I don't give a fuck.  I was working, I'll tell you about it.  There'll be somebody else.  I was working with Andrew Dice Clay.  Here's what I was making.  $100 a show I started.  Wow.  That's good money.  I know, I know.  I fought for it.  I started, I thought Club Story Kenny was kidding when he called me.  It was Dice, he left me messages. 
[02:51:00]  He goes, you want to come?  I'm doing, uh, Houston, I'm doing Dallas.  And, uh, Kenny calls me, he goes, we'll fly you down.  It pays $100 a show.  And I almost said.  Like $100,000?  I couldn't believe the money was at all for, but I'm like, this is going to be a joke.  But I'm like, it was, it was serious.  And, um, I had a decision to make.  And I'm like, what do I want to do?  And I'm like, fuck it, man.  It's not about the money.  Yeah.  It's just not.  And I knew it wasn't.  There's equity in doing the show.  3,000 people one night, 2,500 people the next night.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:51:30]  Uh, I didn't bitch about the money.  I just went and did the gig, which eventually led to me being here.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Which led to me doing so much stuff.  See?  That $100, look at what that got you.  So if you're being greedy with money, um, fucking beat it.  And I heard Leno, this is what I heard.  I heard Leno and Shanley used to both do the Tonight Show and guest host it.  And Gary wanted a lot of money, like 20 an episode.  What a dope.  And, uh, Leno said, I'll do it for scale.  And they're like, well, there's our guest host.  Because he was smart.  He understood.  That's the mistake so many people make, especially in entertainment.  We can speak for entertainers. 
[02:52:00]  They demand a lot of money.  Well, thank God that's not a mistake we made.  Yeah, they don't understand the opportunity at hand.  No, Aaron.  Look.  I'm not kidding.  I was doing nights at BAB, and I went to Boston for the same salary, and I was hoping  to make more.  I could have just said, fuck that.  And Anthony could have said, fuck that, because they were paying him the same amount of money  he was doing in construction.  But we saw an amazing opportunity, and it wasn't about, you know, making money right  away.  It was taking hold of the opportunity at hand. 
[02:52:30]  So many people make that mistake.  So many people.  They don't see what they call the big picture.  I don't think this guy's holding out for money.  Just the sound of what he said.  No, he's scared.  No, no, no, no.  But Steve.  He's scared.  Steve.  Yeah.  Got to listen a little better.  What happened?  We just kind of went.  I know.  That led to something else that we're talking about.  That's all.  We already established that that guy's scared.  Really?  This is what we should do.  Get YSP on the phone.  We're going to do two days in Philly.  And why not?  That Friday.  Why don't we do car crash comedy from a venue?  Friday morning. 
[02:53:00]  You just redo it, man.  Let's redo it.  Don't do it.  And it's an open call to comedians from all over.  I don't care.  It doesn't have to be amateurs.  It can be anybody.  Is it the 15th?  September 15th.  That 15th, that Saturday night, when you're doing some shithouse in South Jersey for $75  to feature, or what, $1.50 to feature?  When you're doing that, you think of that money you're making, or the 30 or 40 or 100 people  you're talking to, when you could be on a stage in front of, say, $6,000 or $7,000 because  you're going on very early. 
[02:53:30]  And no matter what happens, it's a great story.  And this is how Leno relaxed me.  It was very nice for me to do my first Tonight Show.  I'm out there on the stage, and I'm getting ready to, they're blocking me to show me where  to come out, where to look for cue cards and stuff.  And Jay is over at the desk.  So he walks over to me.  He's very nice.  And he goes, hey, I'm Jay.  And I'm like, wow, thanks for having me.  And he goes, look, this is a no-pressure gig.  He goes, look, if you do great, you come back.  If you do terrible, it's a great story.  He's like, it's fine. 
[02:54:00]  He's talking to me like a comic.  Like a comic.  But I'm telling that dumb Ed, that's the way it is.  If you get booed off, yeah, it sucks.  But you'll do something funny with that if you're a comic.  Yep.  Even if it's not in the moment.  Even if it sucks in the moment.  The reason you're funny, you little twerp, is because you're a little twerp.  You've taken this fucking part that you hate, which is, believe me, you'd give anything  to be fucking 5'11 with dark brown hair and a great chin and not funny and fucking hot  chicks all the time.  But you're a broken little man and you get jerked off for money. 
[02:54:30]  I certainly relate to it.  And that's why you're funny.  You know what I mean?  You have the ability to take what is awful and agonizing and make it funny.  So don't be such a little bitch.  If you get booed off the stage, so fucking what?  Let's do it all out to this guy.  But it's the truth.  Yeah.  You won't get booed because the material is Tony Robbins, but the material is strong  and he did well.  Philly will like him because he's a fucking Philly guy and he's funny.  We're not doing Ed a favor.  He was funny and he won fair and square.  It's kind of an easy spot, too. 
[02:55:00]  Yes, it really is because people are still settling in and stuff.  They don't have as much alcohol in them yet.  It's just they're they're forgiving.  Yeah, they're not geared up to boo yet.  No, they're sitting down, kind of figuring out where the seats are and they're paying attention.  It's a nice spot to be in.  And that guy, Seton Smith, man, he took the opportunity and ran.  Yep.  And now we all know who Seton Smith is on the show.  And then he took the TV and did the same thing.  He's black.  He was so humble, too.  He was so appreciative.  So let's do Car Crush Comedy all over again when we go to Philly.  Let's do it from a live venue on Friday. 
[02:55:30]  We'll really, we'll really, you know, have some fun with that.  Calling all comedians.  The last, the last opening spot on this tour because it's the last show.  That I'm at the twilight of my thing.  Shut up.  I am at the twilight of my career.  What are you talking to?  All right.  Tell it to yourself in the mirror.  You're frightened.  Just admit it.  And if YSB is listening or Steve will hopefully tell him.  Yeah, just start the promos that Ed was scared and Opie and Anthony want to find a man's  man that is willing to go in front of our crowd and do some comedy. 
[02:56:00]  Car Crash Comedy.  We'll do it again in Philly.  Let's talk to Ed first.  Let's talk to him tomorrow whenever we can and maybe see what's going on with him.  I would like to talk to him once.  All right.  Well, we're doing Car Crash Comedy for the show at the PNC this weekend.  Yes.  So if you think you're funny and want a chance to perform on stage at the Trolling Virus  show at the PNC Bank Arts Center this coming Saturday, you should sign up for Car  Crash Comedy.  The winner will open up for this week's Trial and Virus Comedy show at the PNC Bank Arts  Center on Saturday.  All you have to do is email Sam at foundrymusic.com. 
[02:56:30]  Damn.  Whose girlfriend sounds like Linda Blair?  She was behind me so I couldn't see her and she was talking.  She sounds like Linda Blair from there.  My girlfriend says that she loves your girlfriend's voice.  Yes, that's the Linda Blair voice.  She's got like a great voice.  Yeah.  But it's nice Linda Blair.  It's not scary Linda Blair.  It's Captain Howdy.  That's not nice.  It's Captain Howdy.  It's the fun little girl in the bar before she was deviled in.  Can we rewind the show for 20 seconds? 
[02:57:00]  Thank you, Anthony.  George of Philly.  Don Marrera is a Philly guy.  How did he do last year?  Schubert was first up and he got raped.  All right.  Well, those two.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  A couple of exceptions to the rule.  Good point, sir.  We're talking about Philly.  Good point.  Two guys.  Philly hates their own guts.  Philly has low self-esteem and that's why they booed the Philly guys.  You're right.  Hey, we got a new bid for Sam, by the way.  We figured out at dinner.  So we go to this restaurant in Georgetown called Me and You.  It's kind of a, it's kind of a, it's ethnic, it's like, it's like venison lettuce wraps. 
[02:57:30]  It's, it's fish.  It's that fucking, I bought a wrap or whatever it was.  It was like, what do they call lettuce wrap?  And I'm like, ah, this will be kind of good.  And it was just a fucking hunk of meat with lettuce around it.  It was, dude, the lettuce couldn't even hold it together.  There was so much meat product.  Are you kidding?  So much meat product.  It was like, it was like, uh, it was like pot roast, but it was venison.  It had that, it had that, you know, that stringy thing. 
[02:58:00]  Dude, and me and Jimmy were joking all the way back to the hotel that it was like, the  way it came in is the way it's coming out, man.  There was, there was no breaking down of this.  You ate it?  Yeah.  It was delish.  Well, I like a little bit of it.  That's why I kill my own food.  Uncle Ted will tell you all about venison.  I make venison milkshakes.  I make venison.  We get it, and you're an outdoorsy fella.  You, you kill your own food.  We get it.  Uncle Ted doesn't let anybody tell him what kind of preservatives he put in his food.  Uncle Ted and Charmaine, we make our own food.  We have cookbooks.  I wear venison as a hat. 
[02:58:30]  I wipe my ass with deer meat.  We know, Ted.  We get it.  You're rustic.  We, uh, I love Jimmy's Ted's impression.  You gotta do the one about how he has to tell us how it is because we're not smart enough  to figure this stuff out.  Well, you know how it is, you know, guys, like Billory Clinton and Al, not so sharp, and I'll  tell you how it is.  Sit down, relax.  Let Uncle Ted steer the ship for a while.  Thanks a lot, Uncle Ted.  Thank you.  We don't know nothing about guns.  You tell us.  We get it.  You've read everything. 
[02:59:00]  We're stupid.  We get it.  That's right.  We're all just liberals, Uncle Ted.  We.  Set us straight, would you?  Please, Uncle Ted.  Come on, Uncle Ted.  Learn me a little something.  As you're feeding us a venison burger, can you tell us about politics?  That's right.  You know, when you're hunting and you're out there and you see the prey and you line  them up.  That's what America's all about.  Yeah.  Kind of like when we did it to the Indians and the blacks.  We get it, Ted.  You're a pioneer.  While you're sewing me a raccoon hat. 
[02:59:30]  Please tell me about the election coming up.  Oh, deer meat sucks a bag of dicks, Ted.  I hate to tell you that.  I ate it.  It was like a heart, but it was meat.  I ate a fucking meat heart with lettuce wrapped around it.  Here's your meat heart, sir.  Shovel it into your asshole, because that's how it's going to be in 25 minutes.  That's how I should have eaten it.  I should have gotten on my back and put my legs up in the air, and they should have mallet  pounded it into my asshole, so I could have went and shoved it right back out and  saved myself the indigestion. 
[03:00:00]  I think they have a shit factory in the kitchen where if you ate the venison lettuce wraps,  they give you an opportunity to save 10% on the bill if you just go in the back room  and shit it out for the next person.  No one will know the difference.  If you can get it on the lettuce, you get 10% off.  They can just re-serve it.  I like some venison on some lettuce, but I don't like lettuce because the Mexicans pick  it, and they're not American.  Let Uncle Ted's...  All right, Uncle Ted, we get it.  You're a patriot.  Thank you very much.  All right, just sit down.  Just sit back. 
[03:00:30]  Put my feet up all a little overconfident, considering I'm a hillbilly who plays a guitar.  Come on, sit down.  I'll play cat scratch fever.  Uncle Ted will straighten you out.  Let me...  Let's get it, Ted.  You have a gift.  Let me tell you why we should shoot everything in sight.  God.  What about cop killer bullets?  Cop killer bullets are a myth.  There's no such thing as a hollow point of bullets.  All right, Ted, we understand.  Can you let us have one point, please?  Right.  He won't allow it.  He won't allow one point.  Ted won't allow it.  Well, don't sometimes kids accidentally kill themselves? 
[03:01:00]  No, that's just a big myth.  They're killing themselves.  It's actually liberal books that are falling on their heads.  The guns are actually stopping them from killing themselves.  Sit down, Uncle Ted.  We'll straighten you right out.  We get it, Uncle Ted.  It's all the Jews.  Keep going, Jimmy.  I can't.  I love Uncle Ted.  It's very energetic.  Uncle Ted.  When Uncle Ted hits me, I don't.  Look, every time he's on our show, it's the same thing.  It really is.  I say nothing.  We like him on the show.  We do like him on the show.  I happen to like Nugent a lot, but he's a bit much. 
[03:01:30]  He called me a liberal one time.  I know.  Dumbbell.  We just have an observation.  That's all.  He assumes because you're in the media in some way, shape, or form that you're liberal.  And of course, you're more liberal than him.  Who isn't?  Yeah, exactly.  So it's like you're a bleeding heart, left-wing, liberal ass.  Well, we were talking about that, and then he was talking about Iraq, and I like to go over  there and shoot the big AR-14.  I'm sure you do.  But then he said something about it.  Well, you've never been there.  I'm like, well, yeah, I have. 
[03:02:00]  You know, I was in the fucking C-130s over in Iraq, entertaining troops, and then he kind  of backed off.  Like, oh, okay.  Oh, but you didn't go out in the combat.  You didn't go out in the battle zone, did you?  Uncle Ted was out in the battle zone.  Yeah.  I'm sure Uncle Ted was.  Uncle Ted's very famous.  They want to be around Uncle Ted.  Nephew Jim is not as famous.  So Nephew Jim just showed up and got on the plane and sat there like the little liberal commie  pinko that he is, and they're just hanging the troops for free.  But they paid me in ripples and other Russian things because I'm a commie.  Get it, Uncle Ted. 
[03:02:30]  But Uncle Ted was playing paintball with the locals.  He certainly was.  Uncle Ted gets paid in red, white, and blue things, whatever they are.  Give me a flag.  I'll wrap it around my head and fly home by myself because I'm Uncle Ted and you're a  commie loving you.  And he can't relate to the average man because he talks about how we should all be able to  shoot our own fucking food.  It's like, dude, we don't live on a thousand acre farm like, you know, you idiot.  Yeah, we're going to blast the frigging rocket off and land on your property.  Half of us are lucky to have a quarter acre. 
[03:03:00]  You know what I mean?  God.  Listening to Nugent talk about hunting and guns is like listening to Gene Simmons talk  about women.  Yeah.  It's like your view makes sense, but for the majority of us, it is unattainable and  unrealistic.  All you have to do is walk up to the woman and say, I'm in KISS.  Oh, really?  Really.  Is that all?  And then what?  And then she fucks you.  You know why they like?  Oh, good.  Well, I'm not in KISS.  And he's telling like, just be honest about wanting to sleep with different women. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Okay, fine.  When I have 250 million in the bank, I'll tell a girl I'm dating.  Believe me, I'll tell my girlfriend, I'll be back in an hour.  I'm going to fuck someone.  And when she says what?  I'm like, you heard me.  Read that statement from Bank of America.  I'll be fucking someone.  And when I get back, I want you to smell my dick.  Would you do that, honey?  Sister.  Read 250 million.  Okay, yeah.  She'll clean it with her fucking stupid tongue.  Well, here's the Sam bit.  So we're at this fine restaurant with the venison, the lettuce wraps, and all the other stuff.  The only complaint we had was they had to have the AC down to like, I don't know, like 40 degrees or something ridiculous. 
[03:04:00]  We discovered that Sam doesn't even eat steak.  Sam doesn't even eat steak.  His chick's frustrated with him.  She's like, he won't eat anything.  Yeah, we talked to Jess a little bit, and she is really frustrated.  And I asked Sam, like, do you at least try to add other shit to your diet?  And he's like, no fucking way, man.  There's something going on in your head, bro.  Jess is cute.  Yeah.  She's very cute.  Well, we should actually get into the whole Clubstone of Kenny and Jess's cute thing. 
[03:04:30]  What happened?  He really made her uncomfortable.  Did he?  Oh, no.  I think there was a little puffy love going on with Clubstone of Kenny.  And let me just say this, you know, this is for the radio because, you know, someone's going to take this serious out there.  But Kenny was smitten with Sam's girl.  Aw.  He was very nice.  He was smitten.  What were some of the things Kenny was saying to Jess?  Well, he said, Jess, do you like to have your hair pulled? 
[03:05:00]  What is it?  He's smitten like a third grader is.  Did he punch her in the stomach?  He didn't mean like sex.  Did he mean just like?  No, he meant sex.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He asked Sam if he pulls it.  Yeah.  His whole.  I'm going to hit you with my slapper.  Oh, slapper stories.  That's another story we got to get into.  But no, I mean, Kenny's whole thing was he was just trying to make Sam really uncomfortable, knowing that Sam couldn't do nothing unless he had a gun on.  Oh, no.  Please.  With a gun.  And as he got a little more relaxed towards the end of the evening, Jess put her hair up in a bun. 
[03:05:30]  And he said, what are you doing with your hair in a bun?  Who said you could put your hair in a bun?  Oh, wow.  She kind of looked over.  You know, is he joking or is he?  Yeah, she was very confused.  It was her first road trip, and she's pretty much straight edge there.  She didn't know how to take Club Soda County, that's for sure.  But he said.  What was that hack joke he did when we first got on the train? 
[03:06:00]  Do you remember?  Oh, my God.  It was off.  Oh, yeah.  That knows.  It's about he was picking up hitchhikers, and he.  Oh, no.  It was a magician joke, though.  Yeah, no.  Okay.  All right.  He picked up this female hitchhiker, and she said she was a magician.  And then she put his hand on his leg, and he turned into a hotel.  That's a good one.  Oh, God.  That was right before he had to be reminded that he was in the quiet car when he walked 
[03:06:30]  by and somebody pointed to the quiet car sign.  Oh, I can't read.  Point to the employee?  No, just some suit coming back from D.C. after some junket.  When you're trying to be relaxed on the train, the last thing you want to hear is that bellowing  idiot.  Anyway, so Sam doesn't even like steak.  And he won't eat rice.  You can't eat rice.  He doesn't throw up from rice.  Dude, at dinner, Anthony, what'd you order again?  This was a really nice restaurant.  Some nice things to choose from.  Uh-huh.  Well, you suggested a salad.  I don't remember exactly what the name was. 
[03:07:00]  It was called a bib salad.  Something like that.  Boston bib salad.  Boston bib salad.  What's in a Boston bib salad?  Lettuce, tomatoes, oranges.  Some cheese and some nuts or something.  Some nuts.  Some nuts.  Some nuts.  Yeah.  And dressing.  Yeah.  Please tell me how you ordered your Boston bib salad on Friday night.  Listen to this.  This is what he ordered for his entree.  I ordered the salad without the almonds or walnuts or whatever they were, without the crushed 
[03:07:30]  blue cheese and without the dressing.  He's a fucking rabbit.  He ate lettuce.  So it was basically lettuce and a couple little baby tomatoes.  That's what he had for dinner because that was the only thing you could find on the menu.  There was nothing on the menu?  Well, they were supposed to have oranges on it too, but they didn't bring out the oranges.  Are you the only child?  No, I was the middle child.  So what was it when you were young, like when you didn't want to eat something, which  every little kid is like, what would your parents do?  Well, my mom said I just simply wouldn't eat and it freaked her out because she thought 
[03:08:00]  I was going to starve myself to death.  Oh, wow.  You probably would have.  And so I would just not eat stuff and then she just gave me the things that I would eat.  Okay.  So you've learned that if you say no, I don't want it, eventually people will worry about  you and bring you what you like.  You know you need a psychologist for this, right?  No, I just...  We need an intervention.  Seriously.  People won't eat anything.  There was nothing like chicken on the menu?  No, there was no chicken on the menu.  And there was fish, but he didn't want that. 
[03:08:30]  There's fish.  There was the venison, obviously.  That's not even a chance.  No, it's not a matter of...  No fish bakey?  No fish bakey.  I don't want people to worry about me.  Like, I don't even try to draw attention to it.  It's everybody else drawing attention to it.  Well, you got your girlfriend to thank that she shared this little tidbit with us and we  were having a lot of fun with it.  And now we're finding out he won't even eat steak.  That seems like an easy thing to eat.  Yeah, steak is some good stuff.  You don't like hamburgers?  No.  Oh my god.  Why?  Is there any beef you eat? 
[03:09:00]  No.  You don't eat beef?  No.  Have you tried it?  Like, why?  I don't think so.  You haven't tried it?  He's not a vegetarian.  We gotta make sure people understand that.  Dude, we really have to have a great cut of beautiful beef brought up so you can try one  piece.  No, we're gonna bring this to the bit.  No.  We came up with the bit.  We're gonna...  We wanna bring a really nice dinner.  No, we don't wanna go hack like we did with the 4th of July boiled barbecue.  We wanna actually have the juiciest steak we could find.  Yeah.  Uh, well, he'll eat some mashed potatoes, but what else?  I don't eat mashed potatoes. 
[03:09:30]  Well, you gotta eat mashed potatoes with steak.  Rice, some rice, some really well-  Oh, he hates rice.  What's wrong with rice?  I just...  That's one of the many foods I can't stand, but I really...  I can't...  I don't like touching it or...  No.  No.  I just don't like it.  He's freaking out just talking about rice.  What else do you really not like?  Like, what is repulsive?  Like, steak's not repulsive to you, is it?  I don't know if it's repulsive.  It might be if it was right in front of me and there was a fork...  Like, if there was a fork with steak on it and it was to my mouth, I would probably be repulsed by it.  What?  Why?  What is it about it? 
[03:10:00]  That is so weird.  What is it about steak or beef?  At all those foods, there's just something about them.  There's some kind of cue in my head that as they approach...  I say, I shouldn't be that.  I can't eat that.  I don't like that.  But chicken's fine.  Oh, yeah.  I love chicken.  But it's the same thing.  No, it's not.  It's like...  It's an animal.  Well, no, it's not.  I don't care about the animal.  Like, I don't...  Oh.  It's not.  It's just...  What's wrong with beef?  Beef is...  What's for dinner?  Something bad happened to you at a fine restaurant somewhere?  Yeah.  I know.  A nice big fat piece of beef in your mouth. 
[03:10:30]  Steak.  Jimmy and I are just wolfing down this venison lettuce wrap thing and just fucking just gorging  ourselves.  And he's sitting there like a little girl eating just like lettuce and little baby tomatoes  with no dressing.  That was his dinner.  It's like the bed that most meals are on top of is what you were eating.  The stuff you throw away.  Yeah.  The garnish.  I had to pace myself because they brought it out with the appetizers.  But that was all I was having.  Just that.  Yeah.  Do you like ice cream?  What dessert?  I love ice cream. 
[03:11:00]  What did you have back at the hotel?  You had to eat something.  No, I don't think I had anything.  Oh, my God.  He starved himself.  I had Coke.  Some Coke.  Barry from Pittsburgh.  Sam, for the bit, would you do this?  Feed Sam in the studio, but make him sit in a high chair and wear a bib.  All right.  And someone's got to feed him.  I like that.  His girlfriend's got to feed him.  What are we going?  What kind of food do you hate?  I don't understand hating rice.  I mean, rice is good food.  I like it.  But what don't you like that you find awful? 
[03:11:30]  Well, rice.  Well, we're having the Palm Restaurant coming on Friday.  Yeah.  They cut up a nice steak usually with our egg whites.  What else do you find awful?  Pasta or noodles.  You find pasta?  Wow.  It's just textury, too.  You don't need pasta.  Yeah, that wet sort of.  Now I'm worried about you, man.  You eat soup of any type?  No.  Dude, pasta's the go-to meal.  Most people will eat pasta three times a week easily.  You don't like spaghetti?  No.  Oh, my God.  And you don't eat vegetables. 
[03:12:00]  I mean, I have raw vegetables, like some.  Like what?  Carrots and celery.  Like, I don't eat pickles or cucumbers or anything like that.  No.  Broccoli?  No.  No.  It's the wet and it's the squishy that you don't like.  Yeah, I don't like any.  And especially if it's cooked, it's done.  What about fruit?  Yeah, I mean, I don't dislike it.  Like grapes?  Yeah, I eat grapes.  No peaches or pears.  No.  I wouldn't even have asked.  Huh?  Anything that starts with P you don't like?  Like fruit-wise?  No.  No, I don't think.  Pickles, peaches, pears.  Well, Sam, we got a surprise for you today. 
[03:12:30]  We got a surprise.  Bring in Beef Man!  Bring in.  Bring in.  Beef Man!  Beef Man, come on!  Yeah!  I'm not terrified of that much.  No, okay.  You wouldn't run around screaming?  Well, we'll see Friday.  You gotta at least try a piece of steak from the Palm.  The Palm is known for their steak.  Yeah, it's great.  They're known for having really good food.  So we're not trying to fuck with you and make you eat something that other people would find disgusting.  Actually, the bit is we're making you eat something that most people would love to eat.  Yep. 
[03:13:00]  There would probably be a similar reaction to the way I reacted at the boiled meat barbecue.  Just because it's just...  No, no.  Because it tastes good.  I don't think it would matter that much.  No, you'll have to...  What? The taste?  Sorry, I'm gonna...  I gag and have a physical...  Why?  I don't understand this.  What if...  What about pork chops?  No.  My mom used to kind of make me eat pork chops when I was younger, but I don't really like them.  No, you don't like things like that?  Mm-mm.  Sausage?  No.  What if you were blindfolded? 
[03:13:30]  No, no eggs.  No.  Wow, we're out of food.  Pizza.  Oh, yeah, I like pizza.  Yeah, of course you do.  You're related to one of the founding fathers of this country, and you can't even eat the diet of an American.  I'm stunned.  There are so many foods that you don't eat.  So little that you do.  Yeah.  Are you a brother or sister?  Are you an older brother or sister?  I got a younger brother or older sister.  Do they eat like you?  No, no, no, no.  They're very regular.  Oh, boy.  Something happened to Sam.  Something happened to Sam. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Something happened to me.  I slipped in the steak.  Cow raped him.  No.  Oh, boy.  Or a bull.  He needs a cow to strap on.  Cow put his cow pussy in his face.  One putter.  Eat it.  Sorry.  Oh, boy.  No, he likes milk, though.  Yeah, I drink milk.  Sam likes gross shit.  Like, he likes milk with pizza.  Milk's disgusting.  That's awful.  Yeah, milk with tomato sauce of any kind.  Terrible.  Like on spaghetti or something.  If you drink milk with that, it's so disgusting tasting.  They get all phlegmy.  And it's phlegmy. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Sam, we're getting a request.  Could you say this word again?  I want to blow it by saying the actual word.  Mike in Nebraska.  Noodles.  Noodles.  Noodles.  Noodles.  There's some kind of thing.  Maybe he said it differently before.  I don't know.  There's other people with the same food issues.  This is a weird one, though.  I'd like to know.  No hamburgers?  No.  Everybody likes hamburgers.  Even vegetarians like hamburgers.  They just don't want to eat them.  You ever have one or no?  No, I don't think I have.  Never.  You never had a cheeseburger from McDonald's or anything. 
[03:15:00]  He doesn't have the weight on, though.  So it's like if he's eating what he's eating, he's healthy.  He doesn't put any weight on.  He's still young.  His metabolism.  Takes care of all that.  Must take care of it.  I don't know.  I guess so.  We're going to go our own ways, and then like 10 years from now, we're going to run  into Sam, and he's going to be a fat guy from all the junk food he's eating.  He's one of these guys.  Some guys will like that, dude.  There's a guy who eats that.  What's that guy from the Morgan Spurlock documentary?  He eats McDonald's every day.  It just doesn't put weight.  There's some guys that have that.  Spurlock.  Yeah, they just eat like shit, and they remain healthy. 
[03:15:30]  It's sauces, too.  Nothing with sauces or ketchup.  But you like pizza, though.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Sauce.  That's like the only.  Elio's?  You prefer Elio's or from a pizza place?  Oh, no.  It's just different.  Pizza place is just.  I got one for you.  Do you like pussy?  Sure.  Do you eat the pussy?  Yeah.  Do you eat ass?  Do you eat ass, Sam?  No.  You don't eat ass?  No.  You don't eat ass?  It's a true sign of love.  Oh.  That's showing you love a girl.  You're young.  You dig in.  Ass eating is for the young.  Ass eating is for the young.  What do you think? 
[03:16:00]  Maybe I'll give it.  You don't want to dig into an old ass.  You don't want to dig into an ass and get a piece of corn or something that would really  mess up your head.  I can't picture what Sam is like fucking.  Well, Travis is obsessed with the notion.  Really?  He thinks it would be the funniest thing ever.  Not from a sexual point of view.  He just wants to see the act and just to see, because Sam's always, he's got his, you  know, his barriers up all the time with the exception of Rob Zombie being five feet away  from him.  Yeah.  It's being pointed out on Pal Talk that he said maybe to the ass eating, but still no 
[03:16:30]  to the steak.  All right.  Let's, thank you, Pal Talk, for helping us out with this segment.  Do you like mushrooms?  No.  You won't like ass eating.  Wow.  Are you, let's say, in bed generally with a chick?  Not even the girl you're with now.  I mean, just say historically.  How old do you now?  23.  How long, when did you lose your virginity?  18 or so.  Okay, so like, over the last five years, maybe you're more normal with this girl, but like  say over the last five years, what, are you more dominant or submissive when you're with 
[03:17:00]  a girl?  I guess dominant.  Oh.  Do you, or do you spank chicks?  Not really.  Do you talk dirty to them?  Only if they start.  Will you now, what, will you just?  I mean, like if they start, then I'll respond and get into it with them.  Okay.  You won't say ew.  Ew, stop it.  I would love to hear Sam talking dirty with that voice of his.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to pound it right into your.  I'm going to eat your ass.  I'm going to eat your ass.  Do you pull hair? 
[03:17:30]  You don't pull hair?  You don't choke?  Not, not really.  I mean, a little.  Choke.  I can't picture him being really awkward.  He's probably not, though.  He's probably an animal.  He's probably, this fucking dumbbell we're looking at probably turns into a fuck machine.  And he just lays there like that weird thing walking out of the ship at the end of Close  Encounters and he's all cocked.  He probably just lays back and the chick's just worshiping his cock and he just fucking  zones out and pretends he's somewhere else.  Hey, we got a guy.  He's going by a picky eater.  I don't know if this is true.  We'll see, though.  Orlando.  I realize it's a bit. 
[03:18:00]  It's, this isn't necessarily a bit.  This is like, this is what we do get into people.  It's a bit.  But there are other people who also eat like Sam.  And believe me, I would like to be able to eat normal food, but they make me gag.  They are called texture violations.  I'm told it's called sensory defensive disorder.  Something like that.  Did you look that up?  Texture violation makes sense.  Wait, there's a food that I can't eat because of texture.  Like, here's an example.  What the fuck is it?  I don't have the food thing. 
[03:18:30]  Exactly.  Dude, you don't get me.  It makes me kind of like go skeevy.  A napkin on your mouth.  Picture a napkin on your tongue.  Yeah, it's too dry in it.  If that's a reaction you have to food, I kind of get it.  That would be fucked up.  Because like you put a napkin.  Picture, like tell me to chew a napkin.  I can feel it.  It's visceral.  I feel it right up in my upper chest and in my neck.  Like, ah.  The idea of that is sickening to me.  I guess I don't even really have to think about what it would be like to eat the thing 
[03:19:00]  that I don't want to eat.  There's just something that says, you don't want to eat that.  And then gag and like I won't even have a chance to taste it.  Yeah.  Like my mind will tell me that it's bad before I even taste it and I'll spit it out.  Say something dirty that you say to a girl.  I don't know.  Come on, yes you do.  Say something dirty that you say to a girl.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Suck that cock.  Say something dirty.  Not again.  It could be something you said four years ago.  I don't really keep track of things like that.  I know, but just improv a little. 
[03:19:30]  Say something dirty that you'd say to a chick.  In the heat of the moment.  You like that?  No, come on.  I don't know.  This is like making a little kid curse.  That's a legitimate question.  It's the same feeling.  Yeah.  I need lines.  I don't know what I would say.  I don't want to say that much.  You need lines.  Line?  How about open your mouth.  I'm going to squeeze pre-cum into your mouth.  Open your mouth.  I'm going to squeeze pre-cum into your mouth.  Wow.  He meant it. 
[03:20:00]  Very sexy.  I think we've got a topic for Maury.  Let's get a hold of the Maury people.  I think we can get you on TV there, Sam.  Let's make him a nice steak.  Come on.  Come on, Sam.  Come on, eat the steak.  Eat the steak.  I'm happy with my diet.  I don't need help.  I don't need to figure out why.  Yeah, but just...  I don't need Maury to feed me things.  I'll say one thing for Sam.  He doesn't complain.  He didn't bitch about the menu we went out.  He wasn't like...  He's got no right to.  Yeah.  Of course he wouldn't.  If he bitched, he'd be yelled at.  Well, people still...  For good reason. 
[03:20:30]  And fired.  And fired.  Fired, too, yeah.  People still bitch, though.  He didn't bitch or complain.  He just sat there and whatever he ate.  I don't care what he eats.  I mean, I eat like an asshole.  You eat asshole?  Oh, you eat asshole?  I thought you said you didn't.  No, not like a nice steak.  Oh.  You get a lot of fiber that way.  Prop that ass up.  Just head first.  Dive right in.  That's what you got to get into.  Eat that ass.  Eat that ass.  Smell it first.  That smells good.  Smell it first.  Just do a little snorting.  Dive in.  Like you're searching for minors.  Get in there. 
[03:21:00]  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, coming soon to the show, we'll have Sam eat something that's very delicious for  everybody else.  Yeah.  Real food.  Big boy food.  Big boy food for Sam.  Do you take vitamins or anything?  I'm a big kid now.  No.  No vitamins.  Where are you getting your vitamins?  I don't know.  Jess always tries to get me to take vitamins, but vitamins.  What's wrong with the vitamins?  Take some vitamins.  I just don't get around to taking vitamins.  Flintstones chewables?  That was when I was younger.  Oh, sorry.  I would love to talk to your mom.  Yeah.  It would be an interesting conversation. 
[03:21:30]  It would be very nice to her.  We would be very respectful to her.  I'm sure she would call up.  She listens all the time.  She would listen?  I mean, she would call.  Sorry about the ass-eating thing.  Is she listening right now?  I bet she is.  Could Mother Sam please call in so we can discuss your son's eating habit?  I'd love to.  I'd love to see what it was like growing up.  Yeah.  Did she yell at him?  We will be respectful, I promise.  Of course not.  We don't make promises often, but we'll make that thing.  We are very nice to mommies around here, except mine.  Mine always gets disrespected.  Hit on.  Yes.  Hit on.  Stop it. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, when she's not having imaginary sex at casinos.  Well, she was on drugs.  Yeah, I know.  You do give some saucy information out there.  You really do, man.  It's kind of saucy.  Very attractive woman.  You can't say that stuff.  Hey, let's go to break with an Uncle Ted station ID.  Hey!  Working hard, playing hard America.  This is your blood brother of all things sonic bombast, Ted Nugent.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie. 
[03:22:30]  You are listening to Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  In this兒.  You're listening to Opie, I'm so excited to love you.  All right.  You're listening to Opie.  I'm so excited to like this.  I'm so excited.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  And I've got youkeln.  We'll be right back. 
[03:23:00]  It's Opie and Anthony. Oh, we got Sam's mom on the phone. No way. Give me a trooper. Is this Sam's mom? Yep. Hi, Sam's mom. Hi. How are you today? I'm just fine. Who am I talking to? This is Anthony. Hi, Anthony. And Opie is sitting across from me. Hello, Sam's mom. And Jim Norton is to my right. Hi, Jim. Hello, Sam's mother. Now, you've heard the show before? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, yeah. To say the least. Yes, I have definitely heard the show. How old are you? Why do I have to tell you that?  You don't be. Well, because I want to feel. Jesus, I'm really trying to get a relationship going here. And the first thing you do is the thing you don't ask women.  I understand that. But this is why, Sam's mom, I have a feeling that you're about our age. It's killing me. I can hear it in your voice. Oh, wow. I didn't even think of that. 
[03:24:00]  Look, all I'm going to tell you is I'm older than you guys. OK?  But barely, right?  Just barely. Yeah.  Oh, my God. Jeez.  What happened to my life? I could have had a kid this older? I didn't. You've raised a very, uh...  I have to tell you guys one thing about this whole food thing you're doing with Sam.  Yeah.  I recommend that you do not try to get Sam to eat anything Sam does not want to eat. 
[03:24:30]  And why is that?  Sam Toddler. One time, I squeezed his mouth open and forced a spoonful of rice into it, and he promptly threw up on the dinner table.  He's so delicate.  Then let me just say, she has convinced us Sam has got to eat a meal here in studio.  He's got to eat some rice.  This is what I don't understand. When we were growing up, I'm assuming I'm talking for the other two guys in the room here, we were forced to eat horrific stuff. 
[03:25:00]  My mom would set a timer, and if we didn't finish our meal, by the time the timer went off, we got a beating.  And it was always stuff we were never going to eat as adults, like Brussels sprouts and stuff.  Yeah.  But she forced us to try all this food.  Did you make Sam eat stuff?  Sam would not try anything.  He would decide before he even had it near him that he wasn't going to like it.  He just knew, I'm not going to like that. I'm not going to eat it. 
[03:25:30]  But, you know, as an infant, you know that, sometimes I would try to make him like, you know, I was like Earth Mother,  and I would make my own crushed up baby food and stuff.  He would not eat anything unless it was chicken, and he could tell the difference.  And even in those, you know, those bad little jars of like pureed stuff that you think everything must taste the same,  Sam could tell from the smell if it was chicken or not. 
[03:26:00]  Ben, chicken is all he would eat.  I'm starting to see something here.  This is your mom's fault.  It's your mom's fault.  Because she's kind of a hippie chick.  She's a hippie chick.  She's kind of a hippie chick.  Who knew that Sam had a hippie chick for her mom?  And you tried to start Sam off with a very natural kind of hippie kind of food thing,  and it destroyed him as far as eating like regular food.  But she had three kids, right?  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  All the same mom and stuff.  So you had three kids, and the other two eat pretty well?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Norm, they'll eat anything.  They eat like, you know, octopus.  They will try anything.  Sam would try nothing.  We were in Paris when Sam was like six years old, and we go to this great restaurant,  and the only thing Sam would eat was a plate of French fries.  French fries.  That's nice.  Yeah, he would eat French fries.  What does Sam eat on Thanksgiving when the family gets together? 
[03:27:00]  Oh.  He will eat a slice of turkey.  White meat.  He will eat that.  Roasted.  And he will eat corn.  Turkey and corn.  And cornbread.  And cornbread.  Yep.  But you know what?  I took him to the pediatrician because I was worried.  The pediatrician says, okay, he eats chicken, carrots, corn, and he drinks milk.  The pediatrician goes, he's getting all the nutrients he needs.  It's your hang-up that you think he has to have a wide variety of things. 
[03:27:30]  Wow.  If he's happy with this and he eats enough of it, he's in good shape.  And they would do blood tests because I'm going, oh, he's got to be anemic or something.  Great blood test results.  So he's been eating chicken, baby carrots, and drinking milk since what age?  Forever.  Since he could eat solid food, I guess.  As soon as he started on solid food.  And he knew what food he wanted, and that's all he was going to have. 
[03:28:00]  I sit there and look at Sam and go, do you realize what you're missing?  There's some great stuff to eat out there.  Yeah.  What's with the red meat?  Sam's a happy guy.  He is a happy guy.  He's got the rosy cheeks.  You know we're convinced that he has candy in his head.  We haven't talked about this in a while, but he's got that type of face that we think  there's candy inside.  And Steve walks around and tries to figure out how to get the candy out of Sam's head.  And because he's such a sweet boy. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, he's a normal kid.  He's very happy.  But we find this so bizarre.  So the pediatrician, that was what, last week?  I don't go there anymore.  You don't go to the pediatrician anymore?  So Sam's mom, where did this start, you think?  You know, I don't have a clue.  Nobody else in the family is like that.  I think it's a control thing with Sam.  I think even as an infant and a toddler, Sam was in control of himself.  And he was going to do just what he wanted to do. 
[03:29:00]  And you weren't going to make him do anything else.  I think it's time to tell Sam that he has a different father.  What?  Yeah.  We don't want to break this live on the air, but...  With the curly hair.  Yeah.  He's got that hair.  Anyone in the family have hair like Sam's?  Well, I have a couple of brothers with that kind of hair.  A couple of the brothers?  And my hair is quite curly, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm holding back right now, Sam, by the way. 
[03:29:30]  I just held back.  I just held back out of respect.  She said something.  I wanted to say something.  I didn't say it.  Out of respect.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  You've raised a very sweet boy.  Well, thank you.  I really like him.  You're going to keep him a while.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  Whenever there's profanity in the studio, Sam leaves until we've stopped.  That's right.  He doesn't like the dirty words or any unity.  He walks out, and he comes back when it's over.  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  And this Friday, we're going to make Sam eat a nice piece of steak and have a little rice  for everybody.  You know what?  I'm going to be listening.  I want to see how successful you are with this.  And a squash.  A squash.  A squash.  A summer squash.  A summer squash.  I must admit, I have a really good time listening to you guys with Sam.  Oh, thank you.  Well, did he hear us give Sam a homework assignment?  Oh, wait.  I didn't hear the homework.  Jimmy, why don't you tell Sam's mom the homework assignment?  I actually don't remember it. 
[03:30:30]  We want him to try mushrooms.  Mushroom is an odd food.  We want him to try mushrooms.  With an odd kind of very thick flavor to it.  Mushrooms.  I believe I heard Jimmy's comment on the mushroom.  Oh.  That wasn't my comment.  That was actually potty mouth Nathaniel.  No, I think that was Jimmy.  So what else should, what shouldn't we give Sam?  Because obviously rice is very bad. 
[03:31:00]  He doesn't like that.  So we won't get him rice.  What is something that he really hated?  Well, anything.  He hates anything that isn't in his, you know, kind of limited menu there.  If it's not, you know, a mini fish stick or a pizza roll or a pizza pizza or a pizza  of a fat chicken.  You don't see this?  So you've got a wide variety of stuff there.  How about sushi?  And he's even desserts.  He's not, he likes chocolate cake and he likes ice cream.  Well, who doesn't?  Other than that, even desserts. 
[03:31:30]  You know, he's not big on most of those.  Apple pie, Sam?  I don't eat any pie.  Oh, no pie.  He doesn't eat any of the American foods.  No hamburgers, no apple pie.  Nope, none.  Sam's mother, was Sam a breastfeeder?  No, no, uh-uh.  No, no way.  Uh-uh.  Were the other two kids breastfeeders?  No.  Everybody was bottle-fed in my house.  Wow.  Hmm.  Trying to think if that has something to do with it.  Oh, I see.  But the other two kids, see, are perfect.  Now it's going to be the mom's fault for not breastfeeding. 
[03:32:00]  No, no, no.  I'm saying you have two kids that are fine and then one that's a little, you know, off.  It's strange with this thing, this arrested development that he's in.  What about, what kind of socks are you wearing?  There, let me see that.  They're the old school tube socks with the two black stripes around the top.  Well, those are coming back.  Yeah, they are.  Oh, yeah, Sam's always worn those.  You know why?  Because he doesn't have to worry about where the heel is, but usually the color ring and  the top of it will match his T-shirt. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, and you're right.  Wow.  They are.  He's got a black T-shirt on and the black stripes around the top.  You raised a serial killer.  Hey, tell us something about Sam we don't know.  I mean, we know the eating habits pretty well at this point.  And the sock thing was terrific, but I think it could go a little deeper for us today.  You know what?  I've got to tell you, you guys have really kind of gone in there and, like, plumbed most  of Sam's, like, idiosyncrasies, I think.  I like to call them foibles. 
[03:33:00]  I will tell you that he was absolutely petrified of things like amusement park rides that went  really fast and stuff.  And we went to Euro Disney when he was only maybe, I don't know, seven or eight years old.  And we forced him.  I mean, I held him down to go on this little, like, small version of a roller coaster, like  Thunder Mountain.  And he screamed at the top of his voice and held his head into my shoulder and cried all 
[03:33:30]  the way through.  And then we got off and he was okay.  And as we're leaving the amusement park, Sam, I said, okay, you guys, you have one thing  you can do before we leave.  What's the one ride you guys would like to go on to again?  And Sam goes, oh, I want to do Thunder Mountain.  See?  So.  That's why I'm thinking we have some hope here with the steak.  He might eat it and go, wow, I love steak.  Could Sam's mom come in on Friday and play choo-choo with Sam with the steak? 
[03:34:00]  Or airplane hanger?  Or airplane hanger, yeah.  You know what?  The choo-choo and the airplane and all that, that never worked with Sam.  No.  Sam is very mature for his age, even when he was little.  But he's not mature.  He didn't go for those choo-choo airplanes.  Oh, he's not mature.  Don't get us wrong.  He's very immature.  He shakes his head.  He even shakes his head very young.  Like when I watch his girlfriend saying, do you want this?  And he closes his mouth and he shakes his head like, mm-mm. 
[03:34:30]  It goes left and right like a baby would shake his head.  Mm-mm.  But you know what?  Again, when he does that, that takes care of him.  You know exactly what he's saying and he's not going to do it, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Sam is strong.  Sam is a person in control.  Sam's mom, can you answer a question we've all been wondering about?  I'll try.  Is he, you know, hung?  Jesus, Opie.  What happened to the respect part of this phone call?  How about this? 
[03:35:00]  Well, she changed the diapers back in the day.  Did you hit Sam a lot?  Did I hit him?  Yes.  No, the only time that I ever even sort of raised a hand to Sam is that once in a while  when he would smart off.  And I would say, okay, that's enough, Sam.  And he would continue.  I would take like my open palm and I would hit it against his open mouth.  Wow.  Nice.  Iraq, you might want to learn some of this.  Yeah.  When he smarts off to you. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  It'd be funny if she had like horrific beatings tales.  Well, sometimes when Sam wouldn't eat rice, I'd put him in a closet and set his heels on fire.  Imagine we just get all uncomfortable.  Well, oh, great.  Thanks.  I was saying early on that you can't do one of those things with Sam like, you're going  to sit there until you finish that.  Because I think Sam said earlier, Sam would sit for days without eating.  And you're right about when you said he didn't complain about the menu at the restaurant or 
[03:36:00]  anything.  Right.  He is not a complainer.  If he sees what he wants, he orders it.  Or if he sees what's on the table and he wants, he eats it.  But if he doesn't see what he wants, then he just leaves things and he doesn't complain  and he just doesn't eat.  So the problem is basically not Sam.  It's everybody thinking that Sam should be doing something else because he's healthy and  he's happy.  And it's everybody else going, Sam, it's time for you to eat.  He's going, no, they don't have what I want.  We just feel like he's missing a lot.  But if he's happy, he's happy. 
[03:36:30]  And he is a happy boy there, Mom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He seems to.  You ever walk in on Sam when he's doing something that he shouldn't be doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, geez.  Open the old door to get some laundry, you know, out of Sam's room?  No, I would never walk in on Sam.  He was very good at his privacy.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  You ever see a young Sam naked?  What would he hang?  How old was Sam the last time you saw him naked? 
[03:37:00]  Probably about five.  Aw.  What would Sam hang up on his walls?  Oh.  All kinds of stuff.  I mean, I got to tell you, the WWE has been Sam's thing since he was literally in and  in the city.  Wow.  So he would put pictures of scantily clad men with big muscles on his walls.  He would put pictures of himself with people like Doink and some of the other wrestlers 
[03:37:30]  that were out when he was a little kid.  Because I used to take him to these signings and things because he was so obsessed.  And, of course, initially, the very first time he ever went to a wrestling match, he  was like, you know, six years old.  And it was at Wembley Stadium in London.  You guys love that Europe, huh?  Winging all over the place.  Yeah.  We traveled around a little bit. 
[03:38:00]  Sam had a little better than I, man.  We lived there for a little bit.  Yeah.  Once every five years, we went to the Poconos.  We lived in England.  Geez.  He's Euro Disney eating French fries in Paris.  We lived in England.  I was looking to get a brand-new pair of sneakers every year.  You lived in England for a while?  Yeah.  What were you doing there?  We take him to Wembley Stadium.  We've got seats for this.  It was his very first live wrestling event.  He'd always only watched it on TV.  And we're going, oh, man, I hope he's not too disappointed because he's going to see 
[03:38:30]  it's not real.  And he's going to see the floor is mic'd.  And that's why it makes all that noise.  And, you know, we thought, oh, this is really going to destroy this kid.  Instead, it made him more excited because then when he saw it wasn't real and they did  such a great job, he had such respect for the theatricality of the whole thing that he  became an even bigger fan.  This sounds like a mom that is talking about her son becoming a doctor.  You're talking about your kid at a wrestling match. 
[03:39:00]  He was inspired.  All right.  I got the idea.  Hold on, Sam.  You have no idea.  Yeah.  I don't know how much fun it is living with Sam.  Well, I'm getting excited because I think I have the idea.  So Sam loves wrestling.  Oh, yeah.  And Sam hates steak.  Guess who wants to come in on Friday?  McFoley.  We have McFoley feed Sam some steak.  Wow.  How could you deny that?  And rice. 
[03:39:30]  Come on, Sam.  That's the best.  Mankind himself playing a little like, what do you call it?  I call it the choo-choo, but you called it the airplane hanger.  Yeah.  That's the bib.  Yes or no, Sam?  What am I going to say?  No.  And plus, we might have some things for you if you do it.  Yeah?  Can you imagine McFoley like, you know, like trying to feed Sam like it's one of his own  kids?  Well, he isn't a good father.  That would be hilarious.  You like McFoley?  He's a man.  Friday, McFoley feeds Sam steak.  You do need the bib, though, and you need a big one so it can catch whatever it needs 
[03:40:00]  to catch.  Yeah.  We agree.  Good idea.  Sam has a...  All right.  So, you know, is there anything else I can say here?  Oh, been cut off.  Yeah.  No, thank you very much.  What do you like about the show?  No, I'm kidding, of course.  I thought the Rob Zombie thing was hilarious.  All right.  So did we.  He was very shaky.  Sam was very nervous.  He was a shy boy.  Yeah.  No, I really enjoyed the show, you guys.  Thank you, Miss Sam.  Thank you for calling in. 
[03:40:30]  Some of it, I feel like, oh, my God, I'm just going to have to turn this part off.  Well, yeah, you could call my mommy and have the same conversation.  That's when my mother turns it up and calls her friends and the difference.  All right, Sam.  All right.  Thanks a lot for listening to me.  Au revoir.  Thanks, Joe.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There you go, Sam's mom.  How come you lived in England, by the way?  Yeah, what the hell are you doing?  By the way, no one do you have a food thing.  The food over there sucks.  That's horrible.  All the beef over there, they boil it. 
[03:41:00]  They're awful.  No, my dad moved there for work for like four years.  What, is he an arms dealer?  What's he doing?  No, he was in advertising.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  We haven't played this in a while.  Yes.  Hope Sam's mom's still listening.  We're going to get to this next time.  Sam's not black.  Mm-hmm.  His ancestors, Thomas Jefferson.  It's true.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong. 
[03:41:30]  For some reason.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a mm-mm, white or a mm-mm.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  Not?  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  There you go. 
[03:42:00]  I love that song.  Just the one line that they should have done.  Oh, we can play it the other way.  No, no, no.  Not the dirty version.  But they should have done a figure.  They should have rhymed with, we can't tell if he's white or if he's not white.  Instead of going, mm.  Yeah, yeah.  They should have just.  I like that.  He's white or he's just not white.  Something about that makes me laugh.  No, because it's too obvious.  Yeah.  It's too obvious that you're taking a word out.  I like it better if they kind of just put something else.  Who the hell is figure if he's white or if he's not white?  Yeah.  If he's not white or something. 
[03:42:30]  All right, here we go.  Listen, look at us.  We've been trying to figure out a wrestling angle with Sam because, you know, he is a huge  wrestling fan.  So Mick Foley.  Get Mick Foley on the phone.  Do we have time?  I want Mick Foley to cut up a little steak for Sam with a little baby-like fork and feed  Sam steak and rice on Friday.  Dude, that is the bit.  Because now, how do you say no to that?  How do you say no to that?  Big, strong wrestler, if you don't eat a piece of steak, he's going to look at you like you're 
[03:43:00]  a pussy.  And you can't puke on your hero.  Yeah.  If you puke on Mick Foley.  Oh, my God.  You like the mountain after you went on it.  You want to Thunder Mountain again, right?  Yeah.  See?  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas as Vince McMahon.  Clean your plate off.  Clean it off now.  You're going to eat that steak.  You're going to eat it now.  Now eat it.  Come on.  Eat it all.  I love the angry Vince.  I wrote it down, dude.  I'm like, it's got to do angry Vince more. 
[03:43:30]  That's one of my favorite things on the show right now.  I love angry Vince.  On the replays when I hear you do angry Vince.  Yeah, that's it.  Eat that steak.  Eat it now.  Yeah.  Has it been brought up, Sam's personal artwork concerning Mick Foley?  Yeah, you mentioned that the last time.  Oh, right.  When Mick Foley was in here, Than was nice enough to bring up the fact that when I was in high  school, I had to do an art project about something, so I picked wrestling and then painted pictures 
[03:44:00]  of Mick Foley.  Ew.  High school.  Well, I'm just saying.  I'd like to see that.  You see them?  Yeah.  They're kind of big.  Well, take the steps.  I'll at least take some pictures.  Take some pictures.  Bring them in tomorrow.  Okay.  And I'm telling you, Friday, Mick Foley feeds you steak.  I can't wait for Friday's show.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Because we were trying to figure out, because we're thinking there was no way you were going  to do this, but you have to do it now.  We found a legitimate bit for you.  All right.  Hey, Drew Boogie, once again, this is worth playing. 
[03:44:30]  Bob Kelly was puking during the What the Hell is That that we did recently?  Yes.  And Drew Boogie took the puking sounds that Bob Kelly made.  Worked his magic.  Yeah, sure.  He sampled it and put it into the Salt-N-Pepa song.  I have a question.  Sam, all the pictures you have on your MySpace, why is there one of you in Joyce DeWitt?  I just thought it would be funny.  Okay.  Oh, that is Joyce DeWitt.  I thought he was making fun of somebody.  That was from that convention in Jersey that Big Kev was at?  That's what I meant.  Yeah, that's what I got her, too. 
[03:45:00]  Can you say facelift?  She looks good, man.  Joyce DeWitt.  She looks scary.  There's a lot of tightness there.  Yeah, I grabbed her ass.  Right.  I'm just always being Johnny Fairplay.  And then I'm like, whoa, where's Jack?  And she's like, he's dead, and we fucked.  Is that what happened?  What the hell is that?  Oh, shit.  Holy crap.  Give me a second. 
[03:45:30]  And then he did it to a Metallica song.  This is quick, too.  Somebody needs to help him. 
[03:46:00]  Help him.  You can hear the puke still on his lips when he says that.  I love those.  Wobby.  We should sample more freaking sounds from the show and then throw it into stuff.  Yeah.  Two boogies on to something there.  Hey, WWE is listening to the whole Sam segment, trying for Mick on phone tomorrow.  Can't get him today.  Mick will be here Friday in studio, hopefully to feed Sam some steak and rice.  Steaky wakey.  Eat all the rice.  Eat it all.  Eat the rice.  Look at this.  We got a big bowl of rice, and you're going to eat it. 
[03:46:30]  You're going to eat it now.  That's right.  And a steak.  You don't like steak, do you?  But we're going to cut it up.  And we're going to make it.  Eat that knife.  It's good, right?  Yelling angry Vince is the best, Vince.  You know how you get favorite parts of the show right now? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  That's up there, bro.  That is up there.  If not the thing right now.  Line of the day.  Are we ready?  Sure.  Let's not forget.  Jimmy's doing a book signing tomorrow in Boston.  No, Thursday.  Thursday.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's right.  Thursday in Boston.  I'll do it.  Barnes & Noble, Boylston Street, 6 o'clock.  Yeah.  Make it easy.  And you're going to be doing Touch and Rich at 4 on WBCM.  Please support your local stations.  Please.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Well, you know how it is, you know, guys, like Billery Clinton and Al not so sharp. 
[03:47:30]  And I'll tell you how it is.  Sit down and relax.  Let Uncle Ted steer the ship for a while.  Thanks a lot, Uncle Ted.  Thank you.  We don't know nothing about guns.  You tell us.  We get it.  You've read everything.  You know, I see a trend.  Maybe we should change line of the day to something else.  Rant of the day or I don't know.  It's more than just a line.  I know, which is okay.  It mixes it up a little bit.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  40.  Wow.  That's the other side of this. 
[03:48:00]  I'm sitting on 40 large.  He panics.  That's good, though.  I'm trying to collect 40 Gs from these guys.  What do you use your points for?  Obviously not hair.  I was just going to say that.  I know, Jimmy.  I know, Jimmy.  I had to.  I had to.  Oh, for me.  Gold star.  We're fucking nuts.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:48:30]  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  Get it started.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Your son has started.  Oh.  I like that.  We've got to replay that tomorrow on the radio.  We've got to get one more play out of that. 
[03:49:00]  E-Rock basically assaulting a fine young lady that happens to be the penthouse pet of September.  Pulled up Caligula.  Yeah, we should actually get her on the phone.  Can we get an update from her tomorrow?  Justine Jolie.  See how that bruise is going?  Find out how her ass is.  Let's do that tomorrow.  Mark it down.  All right.  We're out of here.  Yup.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Yeah, Michelle's down on Full House.  I fuck Kimmy Gibbler.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I'm sorry. </pre>
