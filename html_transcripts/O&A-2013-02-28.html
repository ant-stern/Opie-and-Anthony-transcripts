<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically profane and boisterous introductions.  The show quickly moved to a discussion of a fender bender involving Opie and his driver, Kenny (present in the studio), who recounted their near-miss with a large tourist bus, highlighting the bus driver's apparent negligence.  This led to a discussion of car damage, with both Kenny and comedian Jimmy (whose upcoming stand-up shows were heavily promoted) sharing their own recent parking garage mishaps.  The conversation then took a bizarre turn, delving into unsubstantiated theories about the Pope's health and alleged Vatican cover-ups based on an anonymous source, followed by a discussion of Roland's eating disorder and his eating habits with his friend Troy.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Journey, spurred by one of the hosts watching a documentary.  They debated the band's history, focusing on the transitions between lead singers Greg Rolie, Steve Perry (whose friendship with David Peck and current career status were discussed by a caller), and Arnel Pineda (whose YouTube discovery and recruitment were detailed), referencing specific songs and albums.  A caller recounted a live Journey concert experience with a replacement singer, highlighting their energetic but clumsy performance and the drummer unexpectedly singing.  Clips of Arnel Pineda's pre-fame performances were played and analyzed.  This segment included a discussion of Randy Jackson's time in Journey and various listener-submitted theories about Steve Perry's departure.  A song featuring both Rolie and Perry was played.

The show also included several shorter segments.  Kenny recounted further bad luck, including a wrongly issued parking ticket, which sparked a rant about aggressive NYC ticketing practices.  Upcoming guests Donald Trump and Jesse Joyce were briefly mentioned. A short, humorous Black History Month segment highlighted J.L. Love's invention of the pencil sharpener.  A surreal segment featured a child-like voice repeating, "Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts," interspersed with other audio clips.  The breakup of Stone Temple Pilots and U2's "War" album anniversary were briefly discussed.  The show also mentioned Mikayla Maroney's appearance and the documentary *Revelations* about Arnel Pineda and Journey.

A lengthy phone interview with Donald Trump dominated a significant portion, primarily focusing on *Celebrity Apprentice*.  Trump boasted about the show's success, criticized imitators, defended his firing of contestants like Andrew Dice Clay, and discussed various past contestants (Piers Morgan, Joan Rivers, Dennis Rodman, Gary Busey, Clay Aiken, Meatloaf), their performances, and post-show careers. He also commented on the Pope's resignation, calling it a "terrible mistake," and reacted to a pornographic video involving Miss Teen Delaware.

Comedian Jesse Joyce joined the studio. He discussed his upcoming gigs in Alaska, his work writing jokes for Seth MacFarlane's Oscars hosting gig (including a viral John Wilkes Booth joke), and his backstage experiences at the Oscars, mentioning encounters with Robert Downey Jr., Reese Witherspoon, and Liam Neeson.  The conversation included observations about celebrities at the Oscars, Renee Zellweger's appearance, and a joke involving a young actress.  The hosts promoted their upcoming shows and Jim Norton's Broadway debut.


Further discussion with Jesse Joyce, included light banter, a joke about an antler head, and a detailed account of his prestigious Oscars parking spot contrasting sharply with his beat-up rental car.  He described his time in a Silver Lake apartment and recounted dating Vladimir Putin's translator, highlighting the inaccuracies of simultaneous translation and an international incident caused by a mistranslation regarding nuclear weapons. He graphically described the end of their relationship, including vulgar comparisons of the women involved.  The conversation touched upon his experiences (or lack thereof in Russia), Geneva, and Singapore, focusing on cultural differences and strict rules. A significant portion was dedicated to a graphic discussion of Michael Fay's caning in Singapore, including visual aids and audio, with varying reactions from the hosts and guest.  The segment also included a discussion of comedian E-Rock's history of spanking women, featuring audio clips of a woman screaming.  The conversation returned to Joyce's career and concluded with anecdotes about his childhood fears and uncomfortable encounters with children.  The segment ended with plugs for upcoming shows.


A final segment focused heavily on uncomfortable encounters with children, including a comedic anecdote about unintentionally "kidnapping" a lost child, and a lengthy discussion on penis size and shape, featuring a guest's exceptionally large penis.  Jimmy Norton was a guest in the studio. The hosts discussed a radio show name change (from Sam and Bob to Bob and Sam) and the return of Who Kid after incarceration. Who Kidâ€™s appearance led to discussions about his mother, masturbation, and a movie involving incest.  There was significant promotion for Dollar Shave Club and Steven Singer's Gold Dipped Roses, with Who Kid highlighting the roses' appeal within the Black community.  Throughout this segment, there was heavy use of offensive language, including racial slurs and vulgar descriptions of sexual acts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beam from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little... 
[00:04:00]  What?  You get a dang open end.  You don't listen to a dang open end.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, god damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning, everyone.  Hey.  Hey.  There's everybody.  I see you out there.  Hi. 
[00:04:30]  You don't see them.  I know.  They don't see us.  Nope.  Not a bitch.  That's the creepy part of doing this thing.  Yeah.  Usually when you talk to someone, you can see their eyes.  Yeah.  You can see what they're thinking.  You just speak into a microphone.  I just assume people are listening.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really a leap of faith, isn't it?  It really is.  What are we doing here?  Maybe no one's listening right now.  I don't even know if they turned it on in the other room.  How could we know?  Who are we broadcasting to?  Big leap of faith we make every morning by even fucking yapping. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Well, we had a fender bender on the way in this morning.  You and Kenny, huh?  Yeah, Kenny picks me up in the morning on his way in.  Yeah.  And we get right next to a bus, big, huge tourist bus, waiting at a light.  And Kenny's, like, peeking to see if the light changed because he wants to beat the guy.  Because he went to the right of the bus, which is a scary place because we had to make a slight turn.  You know what I'm saying?  So you've got to give those trucks and those buses some room. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And we're at the light.  And I saw Kenny's move.  He's like, I'm going to beat this guy.  That's my move.  Sure.  And he couldn't really see the light changing.  So the bus got a slight head start on him.  And then all of a sudden, Kenny goes, this guy's going to hit me.  This guy's going to hit me.  This guy's going to hit me.  And just scrape.  Did Kenny beep?  There was no way to.  He couldn't do anything.  But did he beep?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  No.  It wasn't a beeping situation, to be honest with you.  To let the guy know he's going to hit you? 
[00:06:00]  No, because as soon as the guy went.  Yeah.  Like that?  Yeah.  And then he took most of the front bumper off.  And then Kenny goes into cop mode.  And he's trying to figure out how to cut the bus off.  Because it's obvious the bus isn't going to stop.  The bus kept going, huh?  The bus wasn't stopping?  Nope.  Nope.  That bus was not going to stop.  Did he know he hit anything or no?  I don't know.  You've got to ask Kenny all that.  I'm sure he'll come in here in a second.  And then he tries to go to the left of the bus, which is now oncoming traffic. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Realizes there's too many cars coming that way.  So then he, you know, quickly, not swerves, but makes a move to the right.  And then just pulls right in front of the bus on an angle like old school.  Yeah, yeah.  Gets out.  Old school.  And then I'm always expecting, because I've been in a couple little things with Kenny over the years.  I'm always expecting that moment that we're all waiting for.  The hey, you fucking asshole.  Or he just pulls the guy out of the bus and gives him a talking to.  And it's, Kenny's like way cooler than pretty much all of us in those situations. 
[00:07:00]  What did the guy say when Kenny came over there?  I'm sorry.  And then Kenny goes, I'm sorry, too.  But we need to exchange info.  And then he looks at me and goes, G.H., I'm not going to be able to drive you any further.  I'm like, I know, Kenny.  It's okay.  As I see the bumper pretty much on the road hanging there.  Do you think that the guy knew by the way he reacted?  Or do you think that he didn't?  You've got to ask Kenny.  I don't know.  He's right out there.  I don't know.  Because those buses are big, man.  You know, I guess you've got to feel that something's going on. 
[00:07:30]  You'd have to feel it.  Yeah, it's scum.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a side swipe.  You know, so there was a big, you could hear the scrape.  It was pretty loud.  And then, you know, when the bus fully scraped Kenny's car, the last part of the bus takes the front bumper off.  Or most of it off.  Could he have pulled up so the driver would have seen him there out of the right?  Yeah, it was a weird, it was a weird situation because I knew, Kenny kind of knew that he was in a situation and he knew he had to beat the guy.  Yeah.  But then he looked, he couldn't see the light changing because these fucking red light cameras all over New York or he would have just like jumped the light. 
[00:08:00]  You know what I'm saying?  But you don't know where those red light cameras are.  So Kenny's always waiting for those lights to change.  And then the guy just got to jump on him.  And then Kenny tried to like make a quick move to the right slightly, but the guy was already in.  I'm going to fucking swipe this shit out of the car.  The fucking sneaky bus driver not stopping.  Yeah, he wasn't going to stop.  That's for sure.  He wasn't looking for a place to stop.  No. 
[00:08:30]  He just kept going.  He just kept going, yeah.  Yeah, here's Kenny.  Oh, look how slow he's walking.  Kenny, did I represent this pretty much or not really?  I got to be an eyewitness for this.  I got to make sure I get our stories.  Eyeball wit.  Eyeball wit.  I got to make sure my story's straight.  I'm sorry, G.H., but I was distracted.  I didn't hear because I was printing out Jimmy's show information.  Oh.  For what?  Well, he's going to Poconuts this weekend.  That's going to be four great shows. 
[00:09:00]  Starting tomorrow.  Tomorrow night, 8 and 10 each night, Friday and Saturday.  Nice.  Poconuts for all the Pocono people.  Right.  Are you staying at the Mount Airy Lodge?  I'll be staying at the beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  So old school.  Do they even run commercials anymore?  Yeah.  They do?  They do?  Yeah.  All right.  That's a casino.  Really?  Oh, that place is happening.  Yeah.  Casino evil.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Fucking cool.  Next weekend, you can see Jimmy at the Comedy Zone in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Oh, Kenny.  He's a Charlotte.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Jimmy's really, he's a workhorse.  Toledo.  He is.  Mm-hmm.  March 14th to 16th.  That's Ohio, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're a little uncomfortable with the attention.  Yeah.  A little fun fact, you have to fly into Detroit and drive an hour to Toledo.  That's a factoid.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't know that.  Oh.  Kenny's a true soldier.  Yeah.  His car's fucked up, but he's making sure Jimmy gets his plugs in. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Let me ask you, how about your car?  Yeah.  Yeah, enough with the plugs.  The bus wasn't going to stop.  Do you think he didn't know he hit you or he knew?  I think he knew.  He had to know.  You hear that noise.  You feel it.  Yeah.  He might have thought he hit a pothole or something like that.  No, the noise was pretty obvious that you're scraping the shit out of something.  Yeah.  We got a guy on the line saying when you drive really big shit, you don't feel anything.  Oh.  I don't know about that.  But I don't drive big shit, so what the fuck am I saying? 
[00:10:30]  They're all loud.  You can hear those still.  They make a lot of noise anyway, though.  Yeah.  Vibrations.  You got to give them.  Baton ball.  That's the scrape.  Baton ball.  Baton ball.  So we'll give the bus driver the benefit of the day.  I don't know.  As the scrapes happen, I'm thinking to myself, ooh, this isn't good at all.  Not good.  Because everything's plastic now.  The whole front bumper's hanging.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  He just had like a little paint mark on his bus. 
[00:11:00]  That'll happen.  And you were looking for that light to change.  I saw the movie you were going for, and he kind of jumped the light a little bit.  Yeah.  And then Kenny's like, oh, man, this guy's going to hit me.  It's an unfortunate situation.  Was he cool to you when you were exchanging info?  Uh, yeah.  He was five foot, and I'm six foot five.  I gave him an anatomy lesson.  What do you mean?  No, I just told him, like, you hit me, like, give me a license, registration, insurance card. 
[00:11:30]  Then he was completely compliant, right?  Yeah.  But he had like a disposable camera, so I guess he's like a company man.  He took pictures of everything.  Oh, he did.  We exchanged information.  Now, when you pull in front of him, did he, was he surprised?  Did he, uh, now you're a former, uh, law enforcement officer.  When you saw him, the first thing he did, was he surprised, like, I hit you?  Or, or was he like, all right, let's take care of this? 
[00:12:00]  Because that would dictate whether he knew if he hit you or not.  He, he was clueless.  He didn't know why.  Oh, okay.  All right.  This, this, this black truck cut him off and pulled in front of him, and now this man  was like.  Right.  Tell him, like, open the door.  Oh, my God.  This man.  Yeah.  This fucking behemoth.  Right.  This monster.  It's in front of him.  Yes.  For a five foot Polish guy, that's a monster.  It must have seemed like that scene where King Kong picked the bus up and started shaking  it and looking inside. 
[00:12:30]  A bunch of people saying, you don't feel anything when you drive a tour bus or a track to trails  or any of that stuff.  What do you mean emotionally?  Well, then it'll be, five minutes later, someone will be like, no, that's bullshit.  You feel everything even more.  Look, I've never driven anything big, so I gotta, I gotta fucking take their, their word here.  But, I mean, the sound was pretty loud.  We'll stipulate that that's correct and we can move on.  Fair enough.  All right, because Jimmy's going to be in Syracuse.  Syracuse.  Yes, I will. 
[00:13:00]  Syracuse.  Nice.  Yeah.  Geez.  Jimmy's everywhere.  The funny bone.  Well, that's because he's taping his new comedy special in Boston.  Wow.  You know, there's a couple of tickets left for those, you know, want to get involved.  Right.  Caroline's in April, you know, on Broadway.  Right.  Up there.  You know, Magooby's Joke House in Baltimore.  Why is Jimmy in here?  Jimmy's literally wincing.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Jimmy's literally wincing.  I'm thinking about my month. 
[00:13:30]  No.  It's not a good...  Yeah, it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work?  Yeah.  It's a lot of work.  You are everywhere.  Yeah.  That's a lot of traveling.  A lot of prestigious stops.  Well, he's trying to, you're trying to get it all, you know, nice for the big taping.  Well, let's not forget the Moon Tower Comedy Festival in Austin.  Nice.  Coming up in April.  Texas.  Yeah.  Nice to know someone's thinking of it.  You and I are, because no one in Austin is.  Oh, my God.  But everyone says that we've got a fan base in Austin. 
[00:14:00]  Where are they?  You've got to come to Austin.  Yeah.  Well, last time Jimmy was in Austin, there was a good turnout.  They were great last time.  All right.  Apparently, that's not the same group.  Oh, jeez.  We've got a guy on the line that said he ran over a Mexican in the Bronx, and they didn't  feel it at all.  So, maybe there is something to not feeling.  Good being.  Feeling shit when you're driving big buses and trucks.  Everybody's got a war story.  All right.  Stop calling. 
[00:14:30]  You know, Jimmy's going to be in Salt Lake City in May.  Utah?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  You should do some skiing.  I think you can still ski in May out there.  I don't think I rebooked that gig.  Go to, what is it, Snowbird out there?  Tweety, tweety, tweety, tweety.  Is that it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I heard you've got to ski in Utah.  You just have to do it once.  Yes.  You can't ski in Jacksonville, Florida in May.  No.  At the Comedy Zone when you're seeing Jimmy.  Am I there, too?  Jacksonville.  It's Jimmy.  Holy fuck, man.  You are going to be traveling. 
[00:15:00]  I didn't know I booked.  Like an entire month?  You booked a lot of stuff.  Two months.  With more to come.  More to come.  Jimmy must entertain.  But why are you blocking out what happened to you?  This morning, you weirdo.  Do you feel any emotions ever?  Yeah.  I know it's like it wasn't that big of a deal, but it's still a real big fucking pain in the  ass.  You've got to deal with insurance companies.  You've got to even get the car home somehow.  Yeah, no.  I'll drive right to my body shop.  Did it fuck up your front end at all? 
[00:15:30]  No, I don't think so.  Are your wheels fucked up?  No, no, no.  The steering wheel turned a quarter to the left.  No, I don't think so.  I hate that shit.  No, no.  Just again.  So I'll just tell, then I'll report it to the insurance company, and hopefully they'll  get the adjuster there quickly to inspect it.  Because the faster the adjuster gets there, then the faster they can start fixing it.  Remember our last fender bender where we got T-boned, and then it turns out that the  guy tried to blame you, even though he ran the red light?  Yeah.  What happened with that?  I don't know.  Maybe he was colorblind. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  Wasn't that like a, it turned out like it was no one's fault, even though it was so  obviously that guy's fault?  Yeah.  Well, because we both had the same insurance company, so they just made it a wash.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  They must not like that.  Yeah.  There's a no-win scenario there.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What's your insurance company?  Do you got the Geico?  Do you got the Flow?  Do you got the fucking dopes with the guitars?  Which one you got?  No, G.H.  I have a very good insurance company, USAA. 
[00:16:30]  Where do you got Baldy, who's in every fucking-  You have to be privileged to have that insurance company.  Oh.  Oh.  You don't have Baldy, who's in every superhero movie?  No.  You have to have a military affiliation to have USAA.  Whoa.  Wow.  So you're not going to be dealing with Flo.  Yeah.  Flo jumped the shark, by the way.  Taking her out of the white room and having her in, like, you know, dark alleys and I  think, what, water skiing or something was the other one?  Yeah, she's helping guys work. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they jumped the shark with that shit.  Fuck Flo.  They should have just stayed in that stupid weird white room with her white fucking lab  coat or whatever the hell she was wearing.  I can't fucking handle the Geico commercials.  All the insurance companies.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what they-  They really are terrible.  What are they doing?  I get a dividend check every year, GH.  USAA is terrific.  Wow.  Yeah, man, we can't have that one.  No.  We're just civilians.  They're not going to like the fact that you're wrapping up a vehicle twice now. 
[00:17:30]  That is true.  No, it wasn't my fault.  We were stopped.  Doesn't matter whose fault it is.  They don't care.  They just look at the fucking-  Are they going to need my statement?  They look at the bottom line and say, this guy's costing us money.  They're going to need my statement, right?  Do you want to sign brisk?  Yeah, he's trying to keep you out of it.  No, I want to make a statement.  All right, make your statement now.  Well, it was the bus's fault.  Thank you.  Ah.  Enough said.  There it is.  Even though you showed some uncertainty.  Oh, boy. 
[00:18:00]  At the light.  I'm just kidding.  He's leaning like this.  Oh.  I'm like, uh-oh.  Yeah.  This is a maneuver.  You've got to be on your game.  The most important thing, G.H., is that you weren't injured.  So I couldn't have that on my conscience.  Then he goes, I can't drive you anymore.  It's pretty obvious to everyone, Kenny.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  Yeah, I knew something was up when I pulled up and I didn't see the vehicle.  And Kenny wasn't out front.  I'm not, and normally you would just be like, oh, I guess, you know, somebody's slept or  had to stop at the store or something.  Sure.  With Kenny, I knew.  You know something's up.  I'm like, all right, something happened.  He set the whole routine.  Jimmy didn't get his wake-up call.  Uh-huh.  It's okay.  I set my alarm for, uh, I just, I slept through the first one because I was so tired.  And then I didn't see Kenny's truck outside.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I hope that happened.  Is Kenny your first line of defense for waking up?  Or is it the final, like, just in case wake-up? 
[00:19:00]  Kenny calls at 10, at 530 and then 535.  So he's my first.  And my final is when the alarm goes off.  Oh, okay.  And Kenny's my first, like, wake-up.  I wake up to Kenny's face on my phone.  It rings, meh, meh.  And I look and I see Kenny, like, good morning.  It's delightful.  Nobody should be subjected to that.  I'm on the other side of the Jimmy phone calls.  Yeah.  Because at that.  Oh, you're in the car, right?  At that point, I'm in the car with Kenny.  And it's.  Oh.  When I say it's clockwork, we could be in the middle of a really deep, important conversation. 
[00:19:30]  But when 530 hits, he stops all conversation.  Yeah.  Because he has to call Jimmy exactly at 530, not 529, not 531.  And if it is 531, which is very rare, he gets very upset and beats himself up about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like to be punctual.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You know, if you're not early, you're not on time.  Exactly.  If you're on time, you're late. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, is that how you look at it?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  But I'm sorry to start the show off on a wrong foot.  No.  It's not a wrong foot.  Yeah.  You should have brought it up at dinner.  We could have used the conversation.  Right?  It's like conversation.  It's what the show is.  So it's good.  Not good that you got in an accident.  Did the car drive well to this joint after the fact?  Yeah, it was fine.  I drove.  Was it rattly? 
[00:20:30]  The garage attendants are very upset also.  Of course they are, because you study your car every fucking morning.  Oh, no.  Kenny parks in one of the garages every morning, because I get the ride home, too.  Just because it's convenient, by the way.  Yeah.  That's it.  You know, it's easy to drop me off and pick me up where Kenny's coming from.  And he studies his car every morning.  He has to do the 360 with the guy, wide-eyed, panicking, hoping that there's nothing wrong. 
[00:21:00]  There's not a ding.  Right.  And then you could see the guy breathe a sigh of relief, like, okay, another day where  there's not a ding on Kenny's car.  This garage is good.  When we were up on 57th Street.  They weren't so good.  That garage, no.  You're like the Jamaican Mike garage?  No, I was in the other garage, closest to CBS.  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay.  Kenny's smart, though, because that's the way you should do it, is when you do that,  and if they fuck your car up, then, yeah, you've already examined it both times.  Poor Jimmy's got a dent on his beautiful truck.  Oh, what happened, Jimmy? 
[00:21:30]  I have a couple of, I know what garage they're both in.  One, I was with a girl, and I knew the garage had scratched it, but I wanted to get her home,  I think, and try to fuck her.  So I was like, ah, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, I'll just wash it off.  Oh, no, really?  I'll just wash it off.  It's a lease.  It's a lease.  And then the other one was in my garage.  I can't prove it, but they know they did it, so they'll fix it.  Yeah, I got white paint on the side of my cars and stuff, because they have to make  those ridiculous right turns to bring your car out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And that fucking circular shit. 
[00:22:00]  Very tight, those garages.  Time is...  Incredibly tight turns.  Valuable.  Yeah.  Actually, my left side, when I say right, whatever.  What did they say?  They were very upset to see your car in that condition?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Please blame them later today.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, they gave me a tsk, tsk, tsk.  Oh.  Yeah, one guy.  I bet you inside, they're kind of happy.  They're like, it serves him right.  Yeah, now they can just bounce.  Mr. Inspecting his car every morning. 
[00:22:30]  Now they can just bounce off the walls on the way down.  It's like, not with this piece of shit.  Do they note that this car has major problems?  Probably.  They do on the back of the ticket.  Yeah, they take the ticket, and he's writing.  I would go down there later, because it'll be new guys, and act clueless.  What are you talking about?  This car, I didn't drive this car in like this.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Yeah.  No, they treat me good at the garage. 
[00:23:00]  They're good people.  They are good people down there.  A little drama this morning.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  That's my life.  It's not easy being me.  No.  We're being around you.  It's my life.  Thank God it didn't happen tomorrow when we got to drive the Poconuts, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know.  I hate to see 40 people disappointed.  Oh, God.  The end of yesterday's show with Kevin Hart and your plugs. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, that was a little...  Really fucking funny, man.  The timing on that was perfect.  Some things just bring it all home.  No, because I would have had a truckload of merchandise to sell at Poconuts.  Yeah.  You don't need to bring a truckload.  No.  So now how are you going to get there?  A little box.  A little box.  I have a car.  I'll get a rental car today.  Or I'll just drive.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Are you guys staying up there, or are you doing the back and forth?  Yeah, I'm staying at beautiful Mount Terry Lodge. 
[00:24:00]  You and Kenny got the champagne glass with the bubbles in it?  Yes, we do.  Going to bathe.  Yeah, we cum on each other.  I'd like to see that.  And you know, is that where they stopped me from going to the casino?  I had to show ID.  Where was that when I had to show ID to walk into the casino?  What?  This was recently, like two years ago.  What the hell's that about?  I'm young looking.  They thought I was just a boy.  Oh, I'm Sprout. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, I'm Sprout.  I'm Sprout.  Hey, you.  Was that Mystic Lake?  Where's Mystic Lake?  It did an anti-social show with that?  No, no, no.  It was not there.  No, no, no.  Then it had to be...  I think it was there.  Beautiful Mount Dairy Lodge.  Beautiful Mount Dairy Lodge.  Or Connecticut.  You didn't say it right, Kenny.  You didn't say it right.  Beautiful Mount Dairy Lodge!  Okay, now you said it right.  No, because you're using all the same...  It's the same...  You have to start low, or you're...  Beautiful Mount Dairy Lodge!  And it becomes beautiful. 
[00:25:00]  It becomes beautiful.  I love that people are just waking up to have to hear that.  Oh, God.  Where is it, Sam?  Why aren't you having the Beautiful Mount Dairy Lodge commercial up?  I mean, it should be up anyway.  So we could hear it.  I want to hear what it sounded like.  It's just a normal day.  We grew up with this commercial, Sam.  Yeah, yeah, child of the 80s.  That's right, it was child of the 80s stuff.  Is this it?  What year is this?  89.  89?  I'm thinking there's ones older than that.  There are older ones.  Well, let's see how this works, though.  I'm getting breakfast. 
[00:25:30]  All right, Kenny, thank you.  The season is just right.  You can play all day and dance into the night.  Oh, that sounds fun.  You're going to dance into the night?  Yes!  A tiny pool?  Oh, the pool's terrible.  No, it's in your room.  That's what makes that cool.  Oh, right.  More reservations.  Phone 1-800-441-4410.  All you have to bring is your love of everything.  Oh, your love of everything.  Beautiful Mount Derry Lodge. 
[00:26:00]  Mount Derry Lodge.  Yes.  No, the pools are in your room.  Oh, I didn't know that.  They've got a tiny little pool in some of the rooms.  Oh, I want a pool.  I have an 8mm film of my parents at the Mount Derry Lodge back in the 60s.  Horseback riding?  Yeah, that place has been around a while.  Horseback riding?  No, yelling, screaming, throwing things at each other.  Sure.  No, they were in a boat.  They were in a boat on a lake with their friends and shit like that.  And my mom is rowing the boat. 
[00:26:30]  Dad was, like, filming it.  Right.  So mom is there just fucking rowing a boat, miserable.  So fucking miserable.  You could just tell in the 8mm?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Yes.  You've got to post that.  I should, yeah.  I like when you post that old video shit.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  My dad took a lot of 8mm films, so I really have to pick some.  I put up the Christmas one of me and Joe.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I play drums and guitar, and I put up some other ones of young, whiny Anthony. 
[00:27:00]  Where do they go for that shit?  I think it's on my YouTube channel, which is O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Nice.  On YouTube.  On the YouTube.  I said it wrong.  The YouTube.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else is going on?  The Pope is finally splitting, right?  The Pope to go fucking take a hike.  Somebody texted me a very interesting theory.  Oh.  That he really may be sick.  He may have Alzheimer's. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, come on.  And possibly, like, is there how his butler got a lot of information?  Now, this cop I know from AC who will text me a lot, my friend.  And I'm like, that was a fucking good thought.  Maybe that, it might be that, because then didn't the butler get a lot of stuff, steal  a lot of stuff from under his nose?  Because he's my butler!  My friend and I are having some red shoes and a boy.  Yeah.  The butler?  Yeah.  Wasn't it the Pope's butler? 
[00:28:00]  The Pope's butler.  Yeah.  He might, but I mean, why would they yank him this early in the game?  Because it might be later in the game than it seems.  Really?  You think?  I don't know.  You just, you never know.  I got it.  My insider's been writing me all night about this thing.  Oh.  Now, I just read these.  I don't know if these are true by any stretch of the imagination.  I don't know if he was a big fan.  They're a powerful organization, though.  He writes, here is the Vatican blueprint on how to cover up the abuse. 
[00:28:30]  We could download that.  Yeah.  I didn't look at that document yet.  Then he writes, my father's colleague was a seminarian in the Vatican 20 years ago when  Ratzinger was a cardinal.  He left to become an attorney.  He personally witnessed Ratzinger with his boyfriend.  Is that possible?  You know, he's got a lot of men around him.  He also said it was widely accepted practice to have sex with the cardinal in order to move 
[00:29:00]  up the corporate ladder.  Come on.  Corporate in quotation marks.  You think there's some kind of a sexual hierarchy that goes on there in order to get a promotion?  It's amazing.  This guy's...  Breaking through the ass ceiling.  Some of the other ones...  You have to take it in the ass.  Some of the other ones, yeah, just for the people out there, this guy wrote me a few  days ago saying, that's what I hear.  My father's one of the three attorneys in Boston who negotiated the $85 million abuse 
[00:29:30]  settlement a few years ago.  So this guy's pretty close to the situation of what happened in Boston.  That's a nice fucking...  He keeps giving me like these little info inside things.  I don't know.  What happened to fucking lawyer-client privilege there?  He's not...  This guy's blabbing.  He's not a lawyer, though.  He's close to one of the lawyers.  Lawyer had a blab to somebody.  True.  I'm trying to download this document.  I want to see what this is all about. 
[00:30:00]  I think it was in The Guardian, actually.  Oh.  It's a PDF file.  The Guardian.  Oh, it's one of these.  It's like 39 pages.  That's perfect.  I ain't reading 39 pages.  No, but you should forward it.  We should download it here so we can have you guys peruse it.  Peruse, yes.  I love to peruse things.  Wow, it looks pretty...  A good peruse.  The Vatican Press.  This is from 1962.  All right, hold on.  Let me...  Yeah, I got to send this to somebody.  Yeah, have a...  Who's responsible enough for this? 
[00:30:30]  Sam, are you responsible enough for this?  I'm fairly responsible.  No way.  Are you sure?  I try to be.  What's your email address?  You know what my email address is.  He'll fucking stop reading it so we can ask Roland what he ate.  Something on the after show.  Is that what's going to happen?  Yeah.  You know.  What did Roland have?  Oh, he went out with Troy Kwan and they had some fucking dumplings.  Yeah.  He's eating a lot of food, that guy.  Who is?  Roland.  And Troy is trying to make it sound like, no, I tell him that, you know, he shouldn't 
[00:31:00]  eat this or he should do this or exercise or walk around.  But then he's taking him out to eat horrible food.  He's a horrible enabler.  And then Troy works it off because he's an active guy.  And then he knows, you know, Roland isn't very active.  Troy has an eating disorder at this point.  Troy is an enabler.  Yeah.  He's a feeder, they call him.  Roland has an eating disorder, not Troy.  No, Troy eats, he binge eats and then he works out like crazy.  Whereas Roland just binge eats.  Now, does Troy really eat bad? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  He eats, he takes Roland out for horrible meals and then the next day he'll work out for  like two hours.  But then Troy like will work the fuck out and, you know.  But Troy's what, 42?  That's crazy.  Oh, man.  I think so, yeah.  How old is he?  He's up there.  Oh, boy.  Maybe we should get into this because now you're just pissed off, Roland.  Have fun with that.  But I've told him to his face, I mean.  Don't get the panda angry.  I know.  You understand that.  I try not to.  Don't get the panda angry. 
[00:32:00]  Fruit.  I want to thank Roland who gave me a link to a movie.  Fucking hilarious, that bit.  Did you get the link to the Journey movie?  I did, but I didn't watch it yet.  Well, the stupid thing was buffered, so I got the first half hour and then the whole  thing stopped on me.  But it was time to go to bed anyway.  But there's a movie coming out about Journey.  It's called Revelation, I think. 
[00:32:30]  And I got a link to it to screen it because we might have, I don't know who we're going  to have in.  I think we're going to have the new singer in and maybe Neil Sean, who's like pretty  much the brains behind Journey.  And holy fuck, dude.  Yeah, good.  This guy, I mean, we kind of know the story and we've talked about it a little bit on the  show.  We've all heard the story of Biff Tennant.  The guy from the Philippines, his name is Arnett or something like, what's his name?  I want to get this right. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  He's just an amazing singer that's in the Philippines doing local gigs with his band.  He also does The Police really well and Bon Jovi amazing.  Really?  Amazingly.  But what caught everyone's attention is how well he sang the Journey songs.  And then Neil Sean and the guys, they're trying to put an album together and they need  a lead singer.  So this is what some of these bands are doing nowadays.  Neil Sean goes on YouTube and just search out Journey singers. 
[00:33:30]  Journey cover bands.  So he might even ran into one of your brother's bands.  Probably, yeah.  Because he was looking at all the cover bands.  He was looking at anything.  He basically put Journey tribute into the YouTube search, Journey cover band into the YouTube  search, great singers into the YouTube search.  And he said in the 11th hour, he was pretty much giving up.  He spent, you know, many, many hours and days like just looking at, you know, these videos  on YouTube.  Probably looking for a white guy.  At first you could look for a guy that looks like Perry and then you look for just a white 
[00:34:00]  guy.  Well, he did.  But apparently he did find Yugo and his band because they wound up getting a cease and  desist.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, so not only was he looking for a real singer for Journey, he was also trying to shut down  other people.  Yeah.  He realized and went like, holy fuck.  What the hell are they doing?  They're kind of, you know.  They're doing it better than we are right now because we don't have an actual singer for  Journey.  So, he says it was real late and he was pretty much giving up.  And he clicks on this guy, Arnel Panetta. 
[00:34:30]  Panetta.  Yeah, I guess that's how you say it.  And one of Arnel's fans, he had this just crazy fan go to his gigs and he uploaded 60 songs  that Arnel did.  Okay.  Arnel had nothing to do with it.  It was just a fan going, wow, I really love this guy and how he sings.  And he made a YouTube channel and popped them all up there.  And that's what Neil Sean found.  And he was in the Philippines.  He's in the Philippines.  Like, poor, poor.  The movie starts with him going back to his old school in his neighborhood.  You're like, holy fuck. 
[00:35:00]  Because now he's like, you know, singing in front of 18,000 people.  And bigger gigs than that because they show him in South America in front of, I think,  85,000 people.  And all of a sudden, Neil Sean is like, wrote the YouTube guy.  He goes, this is no joke.  This is Neil Sean from Journey.  Would you like to audition for our band?  Or are you the friend of this guy?  Because he doesn't know much yet.  And all of a sudden, the guy gets to Arnel and he goes, fucking Neil Sean of Journey is 
[00:35:30]  writing me on the YouTube channel.  Can I give him your number?  And he goes, yeah.  And all of a sudden, Neil Sean's calling this guy at his house, this shitty little house  in the Philippines.  He flies him to LA and within, I think, three to five days, they all said, holy fuck, you're  going to be our singer.  It's an amazing story.  Like Marky Mark.  Marky Mark.  And Rockstar.  Rockstar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's an amazing story because we've heard his voice and how great it sounds.  Yeah.  We hear a little bit of him?  And then...  He sounds just like Steve Perry, right? 
[00:36:00]  He's pretty good.  Yeah.  And then I'm at the point where they go back to the history of Journey, how they started,  and Steve Perry, and it was really getting good, and then the stupid fucking thing buffered.  Buffering, buffering.  I'm only a half hour in, but man, if you're into music, you're going to love this thing.  Buffering, buffering.  Wow.  Just don't stop believing, of course, with Arnell Panetta.  Where's this perfect camera angle?  Where's this song?  Come on.  Yeah, this is produced. 
[00:36:30]  He sounds just like him.  It's rare that you can find a gig with the band doing the cover. 
[00:37:00]  Like, what a rare gig this is for this guy.  Yeah, he's a guy, right?  And, you know, he has to look.  He's foreign, but he definitely looks like Steve Perry.  Oh, from far away.  But Steve Perry kind of looked foreign.  Yeah, that Asian hair.  Right.  Yeah.  Pretty amazing, right?  I don't know when this movie's hitting, but I got the link yesterday. 
[00:37:30]  I'm sure it's coming out in a couple weeks.  It's amazing, right?  Steve Perry must be miserable.  Yeah, he left the band in 98.  I didn't realize he made it to 98.  He was returning from 77 to 98.  He's very good.  He doesn't have the power Steve Perry has on high notes, and he's a little grittier.  Steve Perry was crystal clean, even on the high, high notes.  Right. 
[00:38:00]  That's great.  That's good.  But Steve Perry could hold that fucking note out.  Could he hold it live, though?  Yeah.  Steve Perry's amazing live.  I guess his first gig, Journey booked South America, Chile, I think.  And he had to perform in front of like 80,000 people.  It was his first gig from going from a tiny little, like, you know, clubby situation.  And he explains what he was feeling right before the show, which I don't want to get, you know.  But everything, you know, the stress, and he thought he was going to pass out, and he was going to puke, and this and that. 
[00:38:30]  And then he wanted to tell Neil Sean, can I just go home?  He was out of his mind.  And then he goes out there and just fucking kills it.  And the whole band was really into it, because not only could he sing pretty much like they wanted, and like Steve Perry, he has a lot of energy.  He was running and jumping around the stage.  And then the management of Journey, like, pulled him aside after the show, even though it killed him, and said, what are you doing out there?  Like, Journey singers just sing the song. 
[00:39:00]  But he's bringing a whole different energy to the whole thing, too, which people are enjoying.  What's the drummer's name, by the way?  Is that, you got...  Neil Peart.  No.  Neil Sean.  John Bonham.  And then you got Cazanova, something like that.  Dean Cazanova, I think.  Dean, yeah, look up him doing Mother Father.  Oh, yeah, you told me about this.  Dude, he must be pissed off, too.  Now, that motherfucker can sing unbelievably well. 
[00:39:30]  So why didn't they just go with him?  I guess they wanted a front man.  You know, you have a drummer singer, it kind of takes the dynamic of the front man, especially a band like Journey.  You know, you want to make an eye contact with that.  But he sings better than this fucking guy sings Journey.  Drummer singers are awful, though, because it's just the guy standing up there, no one knows what to do.  There's no one to focus on.  Yeah, there's no real...  But, man.  Yeah, find that.  Did you find it? 
[00:40:00]  Is this the drummer doing it?  Yeah, I just wish...  Is this the Steve Perry song?  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, let's see.  Oh, it's the keyboards.  No, it's the drummer who sings this.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Dude. 
[00:40:30]  I just don't know this song that well.  It's by a recording.  He's got a big mic.  Now, he's nailing it.  And he's playing the fucking...  He's nailing it.  Look at this shit.  And he plays.  Oh, yeah.  This song.  Okay.  Mother, mother, sister, hey, come back, try it, leave her, hey, mother, father, dreamer, don't you know that I'm alive for you? 
[00:41:00]  That's pretty good.  It's fucking amazing.  Jesus.  I bet you he sings that song in concert.  I bet you they give him that one.  I wouldn't know.  I haven't seen Journey in a long time.  Yeah, apparently they threw him that one.  But then there was some kind of thing that went on where it's like, look, you can't give the drummer this song.  Why?  Because it's one of those songs with the lighters and everything.  And it was kind of getting to the point. 
[00:41:30]  But he fucking nails it.  Then how about you get someone else to drum that song and let this guy have his...  Right?  His spotlight.  Have his fucking moment.  The drummer's probably looking at the fact, I can't believe we're still doing gigs when our lead singer left 15 years ago.  Fuck it.  Give it to the Asian kid.  Not only gigs, in front of 80-something thousand people.  Yeah, yeah.  For the record, Steve Perry is a Cherokee.  Is he?  So he's got a little exotic little tool in him.  Is he still singing or no, Steve Perry? 
[00:42:00]  Can he still sing?  It's a weird story.  People don't really know what the fuck.  He's not singing.  Maybe his voice is shot.  How old is Steve Perry?  Does someone know about Steve Perry?  Because I really don't know.  I know that he's really not out there at all.  How old is he?  I'm going to guess 55 or so.  55?  I'm going to total guess just 10 years from now.  Probably.  Probably maybe...  64.  Oh, wow.  What?  64.  How old is Neil Sean?  Neil Sean got a very early start in music, though.  He started with Santana. 
[00:42:30]  It's like 15 years younger than fucking Tom Skerritt.  It's amazing.  Wow.  Yeah, Neil Sean played at Woodstock with Santana.  He was only 15, I think.  Yeah, he was a kid.  15 or 16.  He was on stage with a giant afro playing with Santana at Woodstock.  Oh, Sam.  There you go.  You see how he spelled...  Oh.  Well, you're not a child of the 80s, sir.  He could spell Lady Gaga, but he can't...  Oh, boy.  You know what?  These kids, they can't spell.  You get a C and an A.  They don't know what the hell to do.  Give me a container of coffee. 
[00:43:00]  I'm happy.  He spelled Sean S-E-A-N.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I'm okay not spelling Neil Sean correctly.  Oh.  Music ain't music anymore.  You need to know...  You need to understand your music history, sir.  Yes.  I know who he is.  He was 59.  59.  Wow.  I didn't realize Steve Perry was that much older.  And a couple more things.  I didn't know the band started out as a jam band.  Yeah.  Early, early journey is totally different than...  What?  Greg Raleigh?  Greg Raleigh.  Yeah.  Greg Raleigh.  I'm loving this fucking movie. 
[00:43:30]  I'm bummed that it started buffering.  Like, I don't know what the fuck that was about.  Yeah.  I saw it in my email.  I was like, oh, this is cool.  Check it out.  I think you would like this one.  And then I'm wondering how much they're paying the Filipino guy.  Yeah.  Probably more now.  They probably got him...  They probably got him really cheap.  What was that?  And what kind of representation could he possibly have?  Like, he had no power in the negotiations whatsoever.  It's like, hey, you want to fucking play with Journey?  And to him, probably...  Giving him $50,000 is like, holy fuck, you're going to give me $50,000. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  But this guy...  I hope they're doing the right thing, because this guy just fucking saved the band.  And pushed him right back into the spotlight.  What's that song that Greg Raleigh was on with Steve Perry that kind of was a hit?  And then you realize during that song, it's like, oh, okay.  I can see what's going to happen here.  They're going to push Raleigh out?  Steve Perry is definitely fucking...  Was it an early song?  Yeah, yeah.  Before Escape?  Hold on. 
[00:44:30]  He wasn't the original singer, Steve Perry?  No.  No, no.  They had Greg Raleigh.  They were a jam band.  Let's see.  Journey started...  I didn't realize this either.  Journey started in 1972.  That's crazy.  Wow.  And then, I mean, their big album was Escape.  That put them over the fucking...  What year was that one?  79 or 80?  Although they had hits before that, obviously.  What year was Escape?  81, I think.  Okay.  I would guess.  That was in the MTV days when they had those videos.  Escape was a monster album for those guys.  It was number one. 
[00:45:00]  No?  I don't know that shit.  Fucking they're not helping me here?  I don't know, man.  You know, you guys have a job on Peltalk.  You don't just sit and look and fucking relax.  Sometimes, you gotta fucking snap to it.  You're the peanut gallery.  Greg Raleigh and fucking, you know.  This is a song they did together.  A song.  Let's see.  I'll tell you in a second.  But it says very rare recording, so.  That's not a...  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Terrible recording, too.  I don't know, man.  I think you...  No, I can't remember the name of it. 
[00:45:30]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Because you really can see that...  You're on your own?  Oh.  Where's Kevin from, Connecticut?  God!  Kevin, what the fuck, man?  Look at this.  You write all the time when we need you, and you're not there.  You guys suck today.  I should just close the room.  Oh, and then, um, they're showing, like, you know, they're getting the tour together  with the new guy.  Yeah.  And all the fuck...  It's amazing.  Every fucking person, even just regular people, have to deal with haters. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, really?  Here's a guy with an amazing story, and he has to go through all the shit.  They're calling him every fucking name in the book because he's not white.  All sorts of racist shit.  Just the same way.  Oh, that is a hit.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know that one.  You fuckers, and I thought that out myself.  No one helped me!  Are you sure?  Yeah, positive.  Then why are you shouting?  Because I would have congratulated some, because I have to...  Now I'm just going to have to bounce some random people to show. 
[00:46:30]  I'm like fucking, uh...  I'm like, uh, the fucking Clash of the Titans guy, just hanging out in the clouds,  throwing lightning bolts.  Motherfuckers.  Does anyone know if they're taking care of this guy, though?  Uh, probably after they realize that he's the guy.  He definitely doesn't get it.  The first deal?  No.  But he's not getting the same cut.  I will guarantee you that much.  I see Greg Raleigh. 
[00:47:00]  Just the same way?  Yeah, but I don't see any with Steve Perry on it.  Well, I think he's probably on it.  Well, no, that's a live recording.  Like, just the same way...  That was a Greg Raleigh song?  Yeah, and then Steve Perry...  Are you sure?  Do you have it?  Here, try this one.  Okay, let's see.  78.  Might be it.  Might be it.  I think this is it.  It looks like it.  This was a hit, too.  It's a big song.  Yeah, it was a big song.  He almost has an REO sound to him, Greg Raleigh. 
[00:47:30]  An REO Speedway.  That's Greg Raleigh.  Holy fuck, yeah.  Of course it is.  Oh, yeah, you forget.  It's a great song, too.  Yeah.  And then...  But you can tell it's like he's the singer.  And then Steve Perry shines in.  Perry's in this song?  Yeah.  All right.  Holy fuck, I'm going to hear this.  Oh. 
[00:48:00]  You're like, oh, who's that guy?  You know what's interesting?  Because you know the song is a hit?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Totally different sound.  You bring to me  The king to my life  Me, me, me, me, me  Stay with me  Won't you stay tonight  In the morning  Stealing fire 
[00:48:30]  Yeah  That's the same way you love me  That's the same way she loves me  Just the same way you do  Just the same way you love me  What did he do?  Did he have a tambourine?  What the fuck was he doing?  What was he doing to them before that?  Yeah, yeah  Oh, well, they're just getting him involved, I believe  Now  Now he sings this part  Like Greg Raleigh's singing his ass off  You know, it doesn't get any better than that  Like he's almost struggling 
[00:49:00]  But I mean, he's pulling it off, obviously  Yeah  And then Steve Perry pops in  And you can hear it's effortless  Yeah  That's the same way you love me  And then it becomes  So this is the transition song?  I didn't know this  Yeah, yeah  Between moving on to Steve Perry's The Lead  Did they fire Greg Raleigh and he quit?  He left the band, they just say in the documentary  I don't know  I haven't thought about this band in years  No one has really  And we're talking about it today  Because this movie's coming out  And I think we're going to get some of the guys in 
[00:49:30]  April, by the way, is when the movie comes out  April, yeah, so I wonder who we're getting  We've talked to Neil Sean over the years  I haven't seen him in a long fucking time  That would be nice  Jake in Tucson's got info on Steve Perry  Oh  Oh, hold on a minute  Oh, oh, oh  That was my fault  There he is  Jake, you there?  Yeah  What's up, buddy?  Jake  What's up?  Hey, my older sister's married to a guy named David Peck  David Peck is the lead singer for Ambrosia 
[00:50:00]  And he's like best friends with Steve Perry  And one day we're having dinner  And I was just asking him all these questions  And he told me when Steve left the band in 98  He was happy with that  He's getting royalties out the ass, this guy  Because he wrote, if you look at the songs  He wrote almost all their hit songs  Oh, wow  Oh, I know  We know he's still collecting a nice fucking payday  But we're wondering about his singing  Can he sing anymore?  Yeah, he's recording  He records  If you go to YouTube 
[00:50:30]  And punch in Steve Perry  And David Peck  You'll see  I'll punch you in  There's a song  They don't show them singing  It's just a recording of the song  And it's both of them singing on it  And this was done like two years ago  Oh, really?  Interesting  If you go to Behind the Music  If you look at Put-In Journey  From like eight years ago  It was from Behind the Music  It tells you the whole story  Of how Steve Perry got into the band  And what happened 
[00:51:00]  How the band just exploded  As soon as he got into the band  It was the manager  Who said Steve Perry  Has to be in this band  If you guys want to go anywhere  Oh, so the manager convinced them  To get rid of the original singer?  Yeah, what happened?  I don't know  Greg Rowley retired  He turned around and said  You know, I want to take time off  And he picked Jonathan Cain  To be his replacement  And then Greg Rowley  Kind of took a few years off  And then started another band  Called The Storm  For a few years  Yeah  Thank you, man  Wow, that's interesting  What the documentary says  They were signed by CBS 
[00:51:30]  And they were doing  They were doing well  But they didn't have record sales  They didn't have any hits  Yeah  So the record company  Went to Journey  And basically said  You really need hits  You've got to change your sound  Yeah  Or we're going to drop you  Well, they figured that out  They were happy  But they weren't happy anymore  I guess  They really wanted more from the band  And that's when they transitioned  From kind of that jam band  That was pretty successful  With an underground following  And then went with the  To mega  The new sound  Fucking arena rock 
[00:52:00]  Right  What is this?  Steve Perry and David Peck  Let's see  Thank you, sir  Thank you, sir  Thank you  Let's listen to  This from 2005  Because then we have another guy  Before we hear this  Oh, 2005 already  Yeah  Because TL, if you could hear me on hold there  From Detroit  We're going to you next  Hold on a second  But first this  Yes  Uh-oh  Sounds very late 80s  This  Or mid 80s  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Is that David Peck? 
[00:52:30]  David Peck, yeah  Peck  Whatever  Yeah  Doesn't sound like Steve Perry  It says featuring Steve Perry  So he's going to pop in  I guess  Yeah  And we got a guy on the line  Saying Greg Raleigh  Never left the band  Really?  Well, where would they put him?  Yeah  Maybe he got fired  Is what this guy's saying 
[00:53:00]  Maybe he was pushed out the door  Right  Of course, man  And it's got a light  Right  We can't do this  Funeral turd  Oh, this is terrible  There's no Steve Perry  No, I don't  They keep showing Steve Perry 
[00:53:30]  In the video  When they're harmonizing  Are they trying to say  He's in there somewhere?  Yeah  I don't hear him at all  I don't hear the signature sound  Of him  No  No  Wow, is this awful  Yeah, fuck that  That's a lovely song  Oh, it's terrible  Did you put that song out in 2005?  Yeah  It sounds late 80s  Yeah  Who puts that out in 2005?  Let's say hi to Gene in Florida  Gene  What do you got on Greg Raleigh? 
[00:54:00]  Well, I believe he never left the band  He's their keyboard player  Him and Sean came from Santana  Which, by the way  They're reuniting with Santana again  I just heard  Yeah, no  He wasn't the keyboard player  During the fucking money years  Of Journey  Yeah, this documentary  No, this documentary says that he left  He was replaced by fucking  What's his name?  Sir, your lies are mounting  Casanova?  No, no, no  Joe Curry's probably sitting there 
[00:54:30]  Yelling at his radio  Why, he likes Journey?  Yeah, we fucking grew up around that time  He left in 1980  Jonathan Cain  Jonathan Cain was the keyboard player  For Journey  During the Wonder Years  Yeah, Raleigh  Raleigh definitely left  Yeah, you tool  And then, of course  You remember the really bad years of Journey  Where, what's his name there?  From American Idol  Was the bass player  Oh, Randy Jackson  Randy Jackson  He wasn't there in the glory years?  No  But he fucking talks about how he was in Journey 
[00:55:00]  I know  He was in the lean years  Was that when Perry was trying to do the solo shit?  Yeah, it must have been  He looks all fucking  He looks hilarious  What songs did they put out?  What was their big hit when they had Randy Jackson in the band?  Does anyone know that one?  Wow, look at him  Oh my god, he looks like Clarence Clements  Yeah, he does  What a tool  TL in Detroit  To you, sir  Yeah, sir 
[00:55:30]  That was raised on radio  Where Randy Jackson was playing bass  Believe in yourself  I think was her biggest hit  Believe yourself?  Believe in yourself?  Believe in yourself, yeah  Be good to yourself?  Yeah, be good to yourself  That's what I meant  I'm bigger to yourself  You know that one?  Nobody else will  We're bigger to yourself  Sir, Anthony was singing  Yeah, I sang terribly  I heard Steve Perry turn on him  Girl can't help him  He wanted to do his own thing 
[00:56:00]  And then they like  They dropped him  Then when they brought him back on  They said he had problems with his vocal cords  He couldn't hit the pitches like he used  Yeah, I've heard that too  I've heard that he just can't sing anymore  Which is pretty sad  But he's got to be pissed  Oh, girl  Can't help it  Well, it seems like the type of voice he had  He was going to blow out something though, right?  That's where he poofed his hair up a little bit  Oh yeah, okay  They had a couple of hits with Randy Jackson and the band 
[00:56:30]  I don't know this one  You'll probably know it when you hear the chorus maybe  God, that's a lot of fucking people  They're so 80s with the fucking shirt  Oh yeah, the suit jackets rolled up  Boy, they got chicks at their shows though  Holy fuck  Randy, what a duchy face  He's like making the bass player  Geez 
[00:57:00]  Wow  Hey, T.L., thank you for that, alright?  Alright, cousin  You guys have a great show  Yeah, man, thanks  There's a guy saying Steve Perry left because his mother had cancer  I kind of remember that  What?  Why would you leave the band for that?  Boy, a lot of people know a lot about Journey  I've seen Journey with the new singer  Let's get a review from Kevin in California  Kevin  Hey, how's it going, man?  You guys rock  Thank you  A couple years ago  My wife and I went down to Sacramento  And saw it was a cheap trick, heart, and journey 
[00:57:30]  And we were like, oh, this will be cool  And  What was your options to doing that?  Having prostate surgery?  My wife did share that for me  What?  Never mind, Jim  That's Anthony  No, but basically, I was going to say  We went and saw the concert  And  With the new singer  Not with  Steve Perry  And  He was okay  Was it  He basically  He ran around the stage so much  That he  He was like  Knocked out a wing half the time 
[00:58:00]  Trying to run and put on a show  Really?  Now  Now  When we saw the show  I can't remember which song it was  But the drummer  Actually  The singer stepped off the stage  And the drummer  Actually sang one or two songs  Now  He was great  He sounded  He had that  Good tone  Like  You know  Yeah  It's called  Cutting your losses  You weren't enjoying that call  Oh  It just was on and on  About like  Like  Like peripheral  Information 
[00:58:30]  That he spent much too much time on  Right  Can you  Can you find the original videos  Of Arnel Panetta  I love  I love just thinking  How embarrassed he is  With the phone  Who's here  Can we talk for another eight seconds  Fuck me  Assholes  Yeah  Everyone in radio  Has those calls  So don't worry  I remember making those calls  I remember calling  A man cast show  A little band after it  Yeah faithfully  His band was called 
[00:59:00]  Zoo Band  Yeah this is what  This is basically  This is where it all began  This is where it all began  Came all the way from  Malangapo  This is what Neil Sean  Saw one late night  Oh  There's no one there  Look at the tables  They're empty  For who?  For what guys?  Where is he?  Poconuts?  Yeah there's more people there  You see the waitress  Just walked by  There's empty tables  Yeah what the fuck  He went from this 
[00:59:30]  To arenas  Thank you  Thank you  Right  Play the song already  Empty  No worry  What?  What?  Oh this is a journey song  What's he saying?  It's like they got a different word  For everything  He just beat up Richard Gere  And took his money  When he was a kid  Yes  Highway run  And then he goes into  Bugger  Into the midnight sun 
[01:00:00]  Into the midnight sun  Will's run around  On my mind  Yeah Neil Sean  Must have been sitting there  Going  Alright  Alright  Give me a number  Rest this  Jesus  Singing to nobody  It's an amazing story  Let's hear the high part  Here we go  Pretty goddamn clear

[01:02:30]  Thank you  Fucking 12 people  A smattering  The guy is singing his balls off  For 12 people  A smattering  Neil Sean sees that video  And next thing you know  He's in front of 85,000 people  In Chile  He's like this is great  He rules  And we could get him  For like 10 bucks  That's why I'm wondering  Like you know  They got him cheap  Do you know how fucking 
[01:03:00]  How many annoying people  Have probably approached this guy  Dude I saw you  In front of the shit gigs  Goodbye goodbye goodbye  What other songs  Because  In the documentary  They did a quick montage  Of everybody else he could do  They had  The police  Bon Jovi  Striper  I don't know  Striper  Striper  What else they got  From that gig  Keep going  Down  Is that  We're not gonna see it here

[01:05:00]  By the way  Running around  Screaming  Throwing things  Naked  Alright  Yeah  This just reminds me  Of playing fucking rock band  Trying to keep this riff going  On this stupid plastic guitar  Stink  Stink  That sounds like Steve Perry

[01:07:30]  The day started with  Kenny getting  Sideswiped by a bus  If you're just tuning in  Listen to the replay  We went over that  To start the show  And now  He's got something else  To add to this  What happened Kenny  You guys want the good news  Or the bad news  I'd like uh  Just tell us one  And we'll see if we can  Figure out what it is  Cause it's always the same  With you  I think we gotta go  Good news  The good news is  Your breakfast is here  Well thank you Kenny  Oh boy  And the bad news is  That you are as well  What's the bad news Kenny 
[01:08:00]  Well Anthony  Yeah  Subsequent to me  Getting into a fender bender  This morning  I know where this is going  Which caused me  Not to  Uh  Meet you  And park your truck  This morning  Oh no  When I came out  To park your truck  It was issued  A parking summons  In error  In error  In error  In error  What do you mean in error  Because you're allowed 
[01:08:30]  To park there  Till 7am  So what the fuck  Exactly  Yeah what the fuck  Is that about  Exactly  So now it's more  Aggravation  I'm gonna take  Eric's good camera  And take a picture  To sign  Because my camera phone  Is not uh  You know  Those fucking  Pieces of shit  That write tickets  Around here  Yeah  They are constantly  Fucking doing that  What time is on the ticket  I'll tell you  Wait wait  Iraq comment  You should see what they do  When there's guests here  From the company 
[01:09:00]  And they have  The black SUVs  Right  Outside  And they have  Those special  Badges and plates  Or whatever  They're supposed to do there  The second they park  And they escort  A celebrity up here  Those people  Are right down there  Oh they swoop in  To write tickets  Yeah and they're arguing  With the  You know  Some of these guys  Are off duty cops  And whatever  And they're constantly  Arguing with these people  As they're trying  To write tickets  Same thing with Fox  Across the street  These guys write  A lot of illegal  You know  Not on the up and up  I should say  Tickets  Just assuming  A bunch of people  Just fucking pay  To not deal with it 
[01:09:30]  Oh yeah that's what happened  They absolutely  They're bunches  Of fucking shit  Cause when I went out there too  There was another  Serious XM employee  That works overnights  That had a ticket too  That was infuriated  Yeah cause now  You gotta deal with it  And a lot of times  You go what  You know what  I'll just pay this stupid thing  Cause it's less aggravation  And the city knows this shit  $115  When I hear that  They get fucking  Punched  Run over  Shot  Love it  Or whatever  I love it  Those two  Not cops  But the fucking  Meter maids  That run around  Did people punch them? 
[01:10:00]  Oh god  Not as much  Not as much  Yeah they made them  That's why they made them  A wing of the police department  Right  Instead of just like  The brownies  They used to have them  In the little brown uniforms  They have them  As part of the NYPD  Now they're not cops though  Right  That's why  Whenever they fucking  Start mouthing off  You just mouth right back  To them  Fuck yourself  When they're directing traffic  I never pay attention  I always look  You look for the fucking cop  You look at the hip  You see if there's a gun there  And then you pay attention  No gun  I drive right through 
[01:10:30]  I fucking flip the bird  I go fuck you  I point out the window  You know what actually works  Which is hilarious  You go  You roll your window down  You point  And you go  Yeah that guy over there  And they turn their head  And you just speed off  Beautiful  It's that old  Hey look over there  Wait what do you do  That's a great idea  You roll the window down  And you go  Well what about that guy  That's fucking everything up  Right  And you point to nobody  And when they turn their head  To look away from you  You drive right past them  It's great  Does anyone  Hey Biff look  And you punch him  Does anyone give Bloomberg shit for this 
[01:11:00]  Cause he knows this is going down  It's a big huge fucking scam  In Manhattan  He doesn't care  Bloomberg doesn't go  Yeah well he gives a fuck  That we  Our sodas are too fucking big  This is aggravation for the people  He doesn't care  It causes health issues  He doesn't care  So what do you got to do now  What is the time on the ticket  The time on the ticket  Is 6.17 a.m.  Holy  It's not even close to 7  Not even close  Right  So there's  The guy knows  It's commercial vehicles only  7 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
[01:11:30]  And then from 6 p.m. to midnight  Is metered parking  Uh huh  Which means you can park for free  From midnight  To 7 a.m.  7 a.m.  Right  And he's got  No standing  All days  All times  Bullshit  Exactly  Yeah but now you gotta prove that  Take a picture of the sign  Your car was in the right spot  Does it say the address of the spot?  It says  Uh  Uh  Uh  South of uh  Corner  West 49th Street 
[01:12:00]  By 6th Avenue  Do you take a picture of where the car is?  No I'm just gonna take a picture  All I gotta do is take a picture of the sign  Send it with the ticket  Said it was written in error  Yeah  I'm a pain in the ass though  And they know this shit's going on  One day we left here  And um  I ran into a Coca-Cola truck  And I  Oh did you get hurt?  I filmed a quick video  Because I saw like 5 parking tickets  On their windshield  And  And they were getting written up  For another one  So I confronted the fucking meter mate 
[01:12:30]  And I talked to the guys  And they were whispering to me  Doing what you were saying  Yeah  Go  Thank you  Thank you so much  These guys are the biggest fucking scumbags  They do this to us every morning  Basically  The guy  Comes out of his truck  And shows me  Just a shit load of parking tickets  He goes  This is all from just  The first two hours of my day  Fucking ridiculous  They just follow these  Uh  Trucks around  That are delivering their goods  And just write them tickets  At every stop  How are you supposed to do business?  And then  Well what happens  And we've done this break  I understand  But it's worth doing again  Then the company 
[01:13:00]  Has a representative  That goes down  With just a shit load  Of parking tickets  Like hundreds of them  Maybe even thousands  And then makes a deal  With the city  Like alright  How much do I have to pay  This month?  But how do you  How are you supposed to  Legally do it?  How would UPS  Or Coke conduct business?  It would be impossible  For these trucks  To deliver their shit  It would be impossible  You can't find a spot  It's impossible  So this guy  Like the Coca-Cola truck  I couldn't believe it  He said  I forget now  Because it's been a while  But four or five tickets 
[01:13:30]  And it was only  What?  10, 10, 15  He doesn't care though  Right?  It doesn't matter to him  It's not going out  No because  Everyone understands the game  The guy told me off camera  Everyone understands the game  We don't even  You know  They don't even try  To find parking anymore  Because  A it's impossible  And B  They just know  This is the game  You know  Someone from the fucking company  Goes down  And pays the parking tickets  But they don't pay  For all of them  But they make a deal  People could find that video  On your YouTube channel  GH  Oh  Maybe I just retweeted today 
[01:14:00]  Kenny  Good idea  It's not a bad idea  Look what I just did  Fucking traffic  Yeah but I'm sorry Anthony  Well it's you know  Not my problem  Oh Kenny  Jesus  Kenny's having a bad day  He really is  I'm kidding Kenny  He's got to deal with  Anthony's parking ticket  And he's got to deal  With a brand new  Front bumper eventually  I'll tell you what  He won't have to deal with  Crowd control problems  This weekend  Oh Jimmy  Poco nuts  Oh it's going to be 
[01:14:30]  A lovely weekend  Yes indeed  You know  I will  But these guys  And they're writing  Of tickets  It's just  It's infuriating  They are fucking  Cocksuckers man  And they know  They just write tickets  Knowing oh  You know  In error  They're not going to  Get in trouble  With their boss  Because they wrote  A ticket in error  Are you kidding me  That's why  There's no accountability  That's right  Absolutely none  And it's a pain in the ass  To fight this shit  So most people  Just say fuck it  I'll write the check  And deal with it  You can't fight  City Hall  You know what  I'm talking about  You know what  You want to go down there  And take on the whole world 
[01:15:00]  That's your business  I just drink my container  Of coffee  Pay my bills  Debt and taxes  My friend  What the hell do I know  Shut up  Unbelievable  Yeah you know  Hey let the boss do it  Let the big muckety mucks  Figure it out  What do I know  I'm a working stiff  We got a break  Because we got  Are you done Ken  I'm sorry  Well if this is the worst thing  That happens to me today  I'll be alright  Yeah  It's the best thing  That happens to you  You're having a bad day  So far though sir  It's okay  It's alright

[01:20:30]  U2 released War 30 years ago today.  Oh, boy.  30 years.  My God, man.  30 years.  I'm a big fan of Live from Red Rocks.  Oh, yes.  There's a live version of the song that's quite terrific off that album.  Indeed.  Back up against the wall.  I just want to talk like Alfred Hitchcock today.  He had a hell of a way of speaking.  Yeah, we were just listening to some of his speech from like 1979, some awards show that 
[01:21:00]  he was on.  Giving him a lifetime achievement.  Yeah, he was like at a dais in the middle of the audience, and he was killing.  He was just fucking such a slow, calculated way of speaking, which he always had.  But at that age, it was even more so.  But he did a great job.  He was killing it.  He was pretty fucking cool.  Very cool.  Yeah.  So you got the war from U2 30 years ago today.  War.  What is it good for?  What is it good for? 
[01:21:30]  Absolutely.  It's War and Peace.  It's the original title.  Oh.  Signed for it.  Of course.  And stupid me, I got excited like we were going to do a single on.  Oh, no.  I thought we were going to do a single.  We were going to do a single on.  Good God, Joel.  Stone Temple Pilots fire Skow Island.  Offer no official explanation why.  So in other words, Stone Temple Pilots broke up.  I don't know.  What are they going to do? 
[01:22:00]  I think they're looking at someone in the Philippines.  They're scouring the Philippines.  They're probably excited.  Like, hey, man, if Journey can do it, we can do it.  We can find a Skow Island in some fucking third world nation.  I saw STP.  STP.  STP.  When was that?  I got to hang with Billy Joel a little bit.  When was that?  Like, I guess it was the end of the summer.  Oh.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  I do believe I came on the show and said, oh, my God, I was expecting a disaster. 
[01:22:30]  And the band was incredibly tight.  Scott Weiland looked and sounded great.  And I was thinking to myself, they finally figured this shit out.  I think he's relatively healthy.  It's always been such a crapshoot seeing them.  Like, when we saw them at that K-Rock thing at PNC.  Wow.  Oh, right.  Terrible.  Horrendous show.  But I've seen them at, like, the convention hall in Asbury Park in Roseland.  And they were fucking amazing.  I think I've seen STP more than any other band.  I think I've seen them at least ten times.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:23:00]  I've seen them a lot.  And most of the times...  Sorry.  This coach trips the kids.  All right.  Is he doing it on purpose?  He actually got 15 days in jail.  Yeah, look.  He fucking hooks his foot around.  What a...  How old?  A 13-year-old?  A 13-year-old kid.  And he's flipping people off.  He's flipping people off as a...  They gave him 15 days in jail for that?  15 days in jail.  For tripping some...  For being an asshole.  You could do 15 days for being an asshole.  In Canada.  That's for sure.  You'd think you'd get more because it's kind of like assaulting a minor. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, STP usually sounds pretty good.  I've heard him sound like crap maybe twice out of all the times I've seen him.  Well, Scott Weiland starts his solo tour this week where he's performing hits from Purple and Core.  Huh.  What?  Interesting.  So he's doing STP songs by himself.  So the band's like, you know what?  Fuck you.  Probably.  Oh, that's the issue then?  They fired Scott Weiland. 
[01:24:00]  When?  It's a big...  Yesterday.  It was a big story.  It was a one-sentence press release.  Wait, who fired?  I didn't even know he was back with STP.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they've been back for a while.  And they fired him again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he's doing solo stuff.  I don't know.  They're not...  They're probably having problems.  I mean...  They're not giving an explanation.  He was fired from Velvet Revolver, too.  It's not like he's the easiest guy to work with.  What cunt this guy is.  Enough already.  I can't stand him.  I love their songs, though.  So I'm kind of like...  Yeah, it's really tough because those songs don't get...  Yeah, I really, really like STP songs, man. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, like I do a scene.  A lot.  He's playing Irving Plaza doing, like, Stone Temple Pilot stuff.  Like, that's going to be awesome.  When's that?  Later on in a couple months, I think.  Might have to check that out.  That would be great.  What is this?  All-Star or something?  You like the list?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, it is All-Star.  Celebrity Apprentice.  All-Star.  Celebrity Apprentice, excuse me.  All-Star, Sundays, 9 p.m. on NBC.  We got Donald Trump calling in a few minutes, so...  Why don't we wait? 
[01:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  I love this show.  I know you do.  So you talk to him.  I would love to.  Delegate.  You want to do the interview as us?  He won't know.  I'm going to ask...  You got to franchise...  If we franchise it, he's getting asked if Opie and Anthony are still...  No, we asked that already.  No, you didn't ask him.  Which part?  We asked if he was still fucking piece of shit or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we got past that.  Yeah, we got past that one.  I want to ask about Bill Maher.  He's still in Bill Maher.  Yeah, at the Bill Maher. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  I want to ask him about Bloomberg.  I want to ask him about his hair.  What are you doing at the Twindy, Don?  Oh, that's a good one.  You know what I want to ask him about?  What?  The fact that on Monday it was announced he's going into the Hall of Fame.  WWE?  That's right.  For what?  Celebrity wing.  Why?  They have a celebrity wing?  Yeah, well, because he...  Remember, he's done lots of gimmicks with them.  Uh-huh.  He bought Raw one time.  Oh, I remember that.  He did the shave your head match at WrestleMania.  Right.  He hosted WrestleMania in his arena two years in a row. 
[01:26:00]  I do remember some of these things.  Mikayla Maroney.  She's just got a wacky body.  She's a gymnast.  She's got a gymnast body.  She's getting goofy looking.  She's getting very goofy looking.  And she's putting weight on.  And a little chubby.  Got a little red beer?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Why are you getting behind this?  Because I know you have to be healthy and...  Exactly.  So that's definitely why I was, first of all, impressed.  Because I've been contacted by a lot of different things.  And this is 10 calories.  And my coach was actually okay with this deal.  He was like, oh, that's perfect. 
[01:26:30]  What a horrible little voice.  You're already...  She's getting chubby already.  She's a joker.  I'm already back in the gym.  First, I have to get ready for Worlds.  But 2016 is definitely on my mind.  And I'm really excited.  You had three broken bones after the last Olympics.  Yes.  So you've had some surgery.  Yep.  I've had three different surgeries.  I competed with two broken bones at the Olympics.  She should get an eating disorder.  They all get a little bit fat after because they bite somebody.  They all get calories in their training.  All right.  So since you're feeling so good, we decided that it would be great if you could give Brian  a little gymnastics...  Oh, this ought to be good. 
[01:27:00]  This should be fun.  These are hilarious.  Really?  That's exactly where they do Red Eye, by the way.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  That's where the table...  Yeah, yeah.  This is excuses.  All right.  Oh, that's...  Thank you.  Same studio, yeah.  I can teach you a lot of different things.  He's got a weird voice, huh?  Roland, you're blocking the TV.  I'm watching the funny...  Roland, we're watching it.  Roland, we're doing a segment.  Say anything, maybe?  Oh, yeah.  What else?  Oh, okay.  This actually means something.  Look at our heinies.  Show me the basics of hand stamps.  Gymnasts have good heinies.  They have those wide shoulders, though. 
[01:27:30]  It's weird.  So first, you kind of...  You put your hands down, and you go upside down.  Okay.  Be careful.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay, Brian, come on.  I can do that.  So I just put my hands down, keep that, and I twist at the end, and I come down.  Do you think this is going to look silly, everyone?  This is going to be gold, no?  He's not going to do it.  No, you got to start like this.  Oh, God.  That would be funny.  Ah, look at the sound, guys.  This came out.  Helping him get a handstand going.  Yeah, I'm doing a handstand.  Now he's on his head.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[01:28:00]  It just got real.  You're right.  That's where the table goes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is zany.  Oh, Christ.  How great would it be if he was paralyzed?  Eek.  Enough already with that.  Oof.  She looks like the Joker.  Yeah, she's got a weird look to her.  She looks puffy.  No, she looks very puffy.  She's got giant arms.  Jesus.  Tiny boobs and like a bubble ass.  Not the bubble butt.  The bubble ass looks good.  Yeah.  The little belly and the little, I don't know.  She's just weird looking.  She did put weight on, though. 
[01:28:30]  She did put weight on.  Thank you, Roland.  Oh, man.  Look what she could do, though.  This is very nice, Roland.  Hey, Roland.  Who are we getting from Revelations?  I talked about the movie for about 15 or 20 minutes, or we didn't.  What's Revelations?  The Journey thing.  I was talking about this.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the director's only in town until tomorrow, and the guys are on tour, so they could call  in.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'm so excited for this one.  Oh.  That piece of shit movie.  Call in.  Yeah, because they're on tour. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, I don't want to talk to the director.  No.  I could do that part.  That's easy.  I could go, wow, that looked cool.  Yeah, you're just filming them.  Yeah.  But, I mean, we still talk.  Get back to them.  We did about a half hour on them today in that movie.  The movie looks terrific.  I only got to see the first half hour so far.  Yeah, because they're on tour.  That's why they're not in New York right now.  But next time they get local, we'll hopefully get them in, right?  Yeah.  Sucker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why am I a sucker? 
[01:29:30]  You just promoted the shit out of that movie.  I really did.  Yeah, but if we like something, who cares?  Yeah.  I'll get some plug oil out of it, I know.  I'll get a meatball or some fucking Sunday gravy.  I know that.  Meatball.  Yeah.  You owe me wrong.  Hey.  All right.  Sunday gravy, please.  Sandwiches tomorrow.  Sandwiches?  I'm not a big sandwich guy.  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  I'm not a big sandwich guy.  It's not about us.  It's about the birthday boy.  Who's birthday tomorrow?  Who's birthday tomorrow?  Iraq.  Is it your birthday tomorrow or over the weekend? 
[01:30:00]  Over the weekend.  The big 4-0 for Iraq, right?  No.  We forgot a zero.  Iraq, how old are you going to be?  Iraq, comment.  41.  41?  Yeah.  No.  You turned 40 last year, if you remember.  You did, right?  Yeah.  No, that's Troy.  Oh.  Oh.  Whoa.  Taking a shot of Troy.  Iraq.  Yes.  How old are you going to be?  I'll be 35.  Wow.  Oh, man.  I remember when he was a little snot-nosed kid, right? 
[01:30:30]  35?  35.  Wow.  That's where the dreams end.  35?  Yeah.  That's where you're on the back end at 35.  Yeah.  Good luck, Iraq.  Dreams are over, Johnny.  Thank you.  What are you doing for your birthday tomorrow?  Sandwiches.  Sandwiches.  What kind of sandwiches?  What kind of sandwich for your birthday?  Oh, yes.  This is the first I'm hearing of-  But, Iraq, are you going to treat yourself for your birthday?  Of course.  Treat yourself!  What does an Iraq birthday look like?  Yeah, what kind of sandwich would you love for your birthday?  I would also love to know about the gifts. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I want to know about the gifts.  What kind of cake does Iraq like for his birthday?  Does he have a special meal?  You don't like cake?  No.  No, he doesn't really like sweets that as much.  We've learned.  Iraq doesn't have a sweet tooth, which is amazing to me.  He doesn't have a sweet tusk.  Brushing his teeth.  Like, what are you doing?  Tickling the ivories.  No cakes. 
[01:31:30]  I'm just letting the laughter go.  Sweet tusk.  Such an elephant joke.  I know.  Sorry, Iraq.  It's not what we get.  I'm going to go out to dinner on Saturday.  What kind of meal are you looking for?  We're going to one of those...  It's a gift for the restaurant.  They're all going to be fucking drinking the night before.  He's coming tomorrow on toast.  The staff, they're all fucking spending like in Goodfellas after the fucking Matanzas heist. 
[01:32:00]  The cook's going to come in with a fucking pink Cadillac.  I love that car.  I love that car.  So, have you dropped some hints at gifts that you might want to friends, family, whatever?  Yeah, but it's nothing exciting.  Well, maybe.  What is it?  What do you need?  Just like some computer equipment.  Oh.  You know, stuff for transferring old videotapes and things like that.  No special goodies?  No. 
[01:32:30]  What about some Simpsons memorabilia?  Any?  The stuff that I need that nobody can afford.  What is it that you need?  I want to see.  The bottom of me.  Stapling.  Oh, God.  What is it you need, Iraq?  I'm sorry.  No, you don't need me for this.  Go ahead.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I see what he did there.  I'm sorry.  J-Rock.  Wow.  Now, what do you...  I'm going to guess you want signed cells and things like that.  I would just like some animation cells.  That's what I mean.  Those were original drawings? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, original drawings.  They're not usually signed, but they're numbered as far as the prints per frame and stuff like  that.  How much are they, you think?  They go in the thousands.  For one?  Oh, yeah.  How many of those do they have?  Well, they have them for...  Up until they started doing the computer animation, they have them for every episode for 20 years.  But they either give them out to charities or they sell them in auctions.  And the ones up for auction can, you know, go $5,000.  Doesn't sound very limited. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  One frame of fucking an entire show for 50 years, whatever it's been.  The ones up for auction are like really famous scenes.  Oh.  Those are the ones that they're very limited on.  Jesus.  You have the screenwriting software already, right?  Yeah.  Oh, right, right.  The movie.  How's that working out, by the way?  The outlines are coming out good.  Have you been writing?  Getting there, yeah.  Any new developments that we didn't...  That's a great question.  Yeah, yeah.  Iraq, comment.  Any new developments in the script? 
[01:34:00]  There's another angle I'm working on.  Oh, man.  This is exciting.  Another angle?  What's the other angle?  Yeah, whatever.  He's not going to tell you.  It involves...  Oh, he is.  It involves the guy's wife.  That he...  We did tell him there had to be a little bit of a love story infused in this.  Yeah, there was no love story.  There can't just be a movie about sliders portals.  There's no sliders portals.  Where he doesn't do anything.  Right.  Except going to the portals.  To change, yeah, what happened.  So it's time travel, and the guy's wife is somehow involved. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  How is she involved now?  Does she go with him?  Does she always yell at him?  No, he meets her back in time, but as he's going forward in time, some complications happen  between him and her.  What, he gets heavy and he can't get back in the machine?  I mean...  Why would he fuck around with the wife that he had back in time, knowing it could fuck  up his marriage?  Sounds like the movie Time Traveler's wife.  Was his marriage fucked up when he left?  Maybe he's going to try to fix it.  He wasn't married when he left. 
[01:35:00]  Wait, what?  He goes back in time.  He's a young dude.  He's not married or anything.  He meets this girl when he goes back in time.  What decade?  In the 50s.  Okay, so they get the 40s and the 50s, they meet.  What about 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and 10s?  For that three minutes of that decade, he meets his future wife.  I love the Iraq movie.  I fucking, I'm fascinated with this.  That's all right.  90 minutes.  Yes, 90 minutes. 
[01:35:30]  And fucking half a century.  So, uh, all right, so he meets this girl in the 50s.  And he marries her?  He marries her, yeah.  Eventually.  Yeah.  As he's going through time, at real time, he marries her in the 50s.  The whole movie's not in real time.  Well, I know, but I mean...  It shuffles ahead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would assume.  So he, uh...  Wait, Jim's got a joke. 
[01:36:00]  Hang on.  No, I don't.  I was just enjoying your shuffles ahead.  Do they have kids?  Are there going to be kids?  No, I don't think there's going to be kids.  No.  No kids.  So in the 50s...  How old is he in the 50s, by the way?  Early 20s.  Early mid-20s.  Early mid-20s.  In the 50s.  He gets married.  Okay.  Do they settle down somewhere?  Um, well, it...  For most of it...  Most of it takes place between New York and L.A.  Oh. 
[01:36:30]  The whole...  The entire United States.  Between New York and L.A.  That's...  Between the two cities.  He's not the whole country.  Oh, I thought you meant like everywhere between.  No, no.  Oh, okay.  So he's...  That'd be a long movie.  So he's winging back and forth?  Um, the different points of his life, he's either in L.A. or he's in New York.  So how are you going to, um, swing...  This is like a period piece now.  Sure.  With fucking old, what, Pan Am fucking prompt planes and shit.  Stuff like that.  Piedmont, yes. 
[01:37:00]  Piedmont.  Piedmont.  Oh.  This sounds exciting.  I gotta see this.  How does he...  How does he hook the wife...  How does he hook this girl in the 50s when he really...  Like...  What does he do?  That he...  You know, this wife would want to be with him.  Um, it...  The way he meets her...  Uh-oh.  Is...  Has...  The way he meets her doesn't have anything to do at first with what he's doing in his  career back at that time. 
[01:37:30]  He just happens to run into her in the...  Like a chance meeting.  So it's not at the radio station.  No.  Right.  Where Jimmy Norton will be starring.  Yeah, I'm the GM and I come in and yell,  Play the hits!  Does she know that he's a time traveler?  No idea.  Does he do anything to make their life easier with the knowledge he has of the future?  Um, yes.  Oh, look at that.  Financially?  Well, it always benefits financially.  Oh, well.  How long does this... 
[01:38:00]  But she doesn't know what he's doing until later on in the movie when she starts to figure  things out.  Oh, so she's like, hey, what the fuck?  This guy kind of...  How did he know?  Oh.  Does he go back and forth?  Or does he go to the 50s?  Between time, no.  No.  And then he just grows.  Yeah, he just grows.  And he just follows his entire life.  Right.  So she doesn't know what he's doing.  Does she figure it out?  Like, I think somebody's a time traveling boy.  What's the point where she goes, oh, okay.  Is it something that he pulled? 
[01:38:30]  Some shenanigans about future information?  Some things are starting to fall apart.  Some scenarios that he was stealing, she starts to notice that was maybe somebody else's  idea.  Like, he's getting a little sloppy in his older age as far as...  How would it be someone else's idea if he has it first because he knows that it's going  to happen?  Yeah.  Because as he's getting older and he's getting more...  Senile?  But egotistical?  Uh-huh.  He starts getting sloppy. 
[01:39:00]  So he's not paying attention to the way he was stealing things.  So he starts inventing things that have already been invented?  Well, no.  Not have been invented, but maybe somebody had...  It was along the time the person who did originally invent something or create something  was just starting to do that.  So now it's starting to overlap.  He's an asshole.  Yeah.  I said that the first time we talked about it.  It's completely greedy and he's an asshole.  So it's basically a guy who's a thief who doesn't stop 9-11 with a Pan Am Lockerbie 
[01:39:30]  bombing and just gets caught ripping off ideas.  Is there a retribution for him at the end?  Is there any redemption?  Is he like blood cancer?  That's being worked on too, but you kind of have to have a redemption idea.  Yeah.  I got to jump in because Donald Trump's on the hotline.  Oh.  We'll get back to Iraq.  He's got money to finance this thing.  Yeah, we'll ask him about it.  But, Iraq, we'll get back to you and your movie in a minute here, all right?  Donald Trump.  Good morning.  There he is.  We love when you call our show. 
[01:40:00]  Well, I love your show.  Thank you, sir.  Donald Trump, celebrity, apprentice, all-stars.  Sunday's 9 p.m., right?  NBC?  That's exactly right.  This Sunday.  It starts this Sunday.  13th season.  Great people, great cast.  This cast looks, it's obviously celebrity because it's star-studded.  And some of my favorites, including Stephen Baldwin.  Right.  And, of course, Gary Busey.  Right.  And Dennis Rodman and Trace Atkins and Latoya Jackson. 
[01:40:30]  We have an amazing cast.  Penn Jillette.  Omarosa Penn Jillette.  Omarosa.  She's nasty lately.  Wow.  She was nasty, I will tell you.  Really?  Oh, that's good.  She makes good TV.  She's great TV, actually.  Donald, do you have your Twitter back yet, or how long did you lose that for?  Well, I lost it for a little while.  Somebody sort of made some pretty rough statements on it.  Somebody hacked it.  We're looking for that person.  Oh, boy.  We will ultimately find that person.  But we had to close it down for a little while. 
[01:41:00]  But, you know, it's at real Donald Trump.  I have millions of people.  It's like owning the New York Times without the losses.  It really is.  And it's, you know, it's been really amazing.  We pick up thousands and thousands of people a week, and it's been really great.  So it's at real Donald Trump.  Tell you people.  We have a lot of fun with it.  We're controversial, but I don't say controversial.  I say I'm truthful.  Exactly.  You really love Twitter.  Twitter was made for you.  Well, you know, I speak the truth, and, you know, I went to the best school. 
[01:41:30]  I did well.  I was, like, supposed to be a smart guy and all that stuff, but I speak the truth.  And sometimes the truth hurts, as you guys know.  You've been through it.  Of course.  And, you know, we have a lot of fun with it, but it's an amazing new kind of, you know,  I guess you'd call it entertainment in one way, but it's a form of information that's unbelievable.  You're suing, obviously, Bill Maher for what he said on Leno.  And let me ask you, as a fellow comic, it seems almost like you know that the guy was 
[01:42:00]  kidding, and I understand what your lawsuit is based on, or what you're saying for the  charities, but it almost comes off as, like, humorless to sue him for that, even though  I know Bill has said a lot of things I'm sure you didn't care for.  Bill's an ass.  But I'm saying that, those feelings aside.  Well, you know, the interesting thing, and again, you know, it's money to a charity,  and to five charities.  We're giving Sandy, we're giving Hurricane Sandy, we're giving, you know, money to cancer  research, AIDS research, all of this. 
[01:42:30]  But he said, I will, he made an offer, and he said, I will give $5 million to any one  of Donald Trump's charities, or to Donald Trump's charities, if he does this and proves  that he's not the son of, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and he went on.  But he said, I will give if he proves.  So the next day, we sent out documentation, information, and we said, please make the  checks payable to the Sandy victims.  So I thought I have an obligation.  I mean, he's a sleazebag.  He's not a smart guy.  You know, he wasn't a good student in school. 
[01:43:00]  He was a terrible student.  He was a, I have somebody that knows him that went to school with him, and he was a moron.  Not like us.  And you leave, you know, and this guy all of a sudden is on HBO, because HBO is a stupid  group, and they put him on, and he doesn't do particularly well.  I mean, the only bad thing about him, I'm probably helping him.  So when I went after Rosie, I didn't realize, but, you know, that's when her ratings went  up.  Now, after I stopped, her ratings went back down again.  But I actually helped Rosie, because her ratings went up. 
[01:43:30]  She wasn't doing well, and then her ratings went up.  So probably the same thing happens with this moron.  But he made an offer.  I accepted the offer.  And I said, pay me the check, and this is where it's going to go.  And I named five really great charities that you'd be very proud of me.  Is that illegally?  Is that illegally, because you've been involved with many attorneys and many, many deals.  I have.  I mean, I'm very familiar with the law.  Is that a legally binding arrangement?  I don't think we're going to find out.  You know, I don't necessarily consider him a comedian.  He considers himself to be a political commentator. 
[01:44:00]  And if you watch him, I mean, you know, and by the way, there was nothing easy about what  he said, the hatred that he had.  You know, he wasn't laughing, smiling.  I mean, this guy truly hates me, which is fine as far as I'm concerned.  But he was nervous.  He was all crazy when he was, and I didn't consider it.  Plus, he said terrible things.  You know, I had parents who were fabulous people, very good looking.  My father was really handsome.  My mother was just great beauty.  And, you know, he was really disparaging.  You've got a very attractive family, Donald. 
[01:44:30]  We know that.  But it says that almost.  My mother was like this great beauty.  And he really was disparaging to my parents, you know.  And you take a look at the way this guy looked.  You know, he's almost a freak.  So, you know, so I feel I have an obligation, a little bit to my parents, although they would  understand.  But I have a big obligation to five great charities, including AIDS Research and Cancer and Sandy 
[01:45:00]  Victims.  Yes.  And lots of others.  Helping people.  I mean, I don't know that we, you know, win it.  I don't know that we don't win it.  I mean, some judge will make a decision.  But he made an offer, and I accept it.  You accept it.  That's pretty much where it stands.  Yeah.  If someone made an offer to you, say, to buy a building or something like that, wouldn't  it be like a process you go through, well, we have to have a counteroffer, or I have  to accept?  Nothing has to be in writing, though.  Although in real estate, it generally has to be in writing.  You know, real estate's a little bit different.  There's different sets of laws, but in real estate, but generally speaking, an offer made 
[01:45:30]  and accepted, if you have witnesses and all, it can be, you know, in this case, it was  a very firm offer.  I mean, he made an offer.  I will give, right?  He made an offer.  I accepted the offer.  And an offer made and accepted doesn't have to be in writing at all.  No, not at all.  Okay.  And again, I'm not necessarily, you know, saying I agree with what Bill Maher said, but  I mean, it was such a ludicrous thing.  He's welching.  No, I understand what you're saying.  You're such a bright guy. 
[01:46:00]  You know the difference.  Sure.  The courts will determine.  And, you know, I look at it as very simplistic in one way.  I mean, an offer was made a solid offer.  He didn't say, I'm kidding.  I'm only kidding.  He was on Jay Leno.  He didn't say, hey, Jay, here's a funny one.  Look, I will give.  Or he didn't say, you know, after he made it, I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  Or he made a solid offer.  And he said, I'll give it to his charity.  He even brought up charity.  He didn't even just say, I'm going to give it to charity.  Now, had he not used the word charity, I wouldn't have pursued it, probably. 
[01:46:30]  Did he use the word charity, though?  Oh, yeah.  He did.  No, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  It was almost like because you had used the word charity in your original offer to the president, his using the word charity was basically just kind of â€“ that's, to me, what made it a joke was the fact that he used the same terminology in a ludicrous situation as you.  It was so obvious just parroting what you had said and putting a ludicrous part to it.  I didn't view it that way.  And you may be right.  I don't know. 
[01:47:00]  I didn't view it that way.  I mean, to me, I just viewed it very simply that he made me an offer.  He said he was going to give $5 million to my charities if I did this and that.  Well, I did that and that.  And I said, send the $5 million to me, and I'm going to give it to these five charities, a million dollars apiece.  And that's where it stands right now.  We'll find out what happens.  I mean, I understand exactly what you're saying, but I think I have an obligation.  And he made an offer, and I did accept it.  And under â€“ you know, there was a man recently â€“ I thought it was on the Jay Leno show, too, where a rapper lost his computer. 
[01:47:30]  You saw that case, right?  Yes.  He lost his computer, and he said, I'll give a million dollars to anybody that finds my computer.  And I think a German tourist found him.  And he gave it back, and he wanted the million dollars.  The guy didn't do it.  The German tourists sued him.  And the German tourists not only won a million dollars, but he got all legal fees.  He got interest on his â€“  Wow.  And this is a very famous case that took place a couple of months ago.  I think â€“  I don't know.  We're going to find out what happened.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I know what you're saying, too.  Although, you know, knowing a little bit about it, they will probably see that one thing was said. 
[01:48:00]  Because the audience did laugh when he said it because of the ludicrousness of the â€“  You know, it's like if you tell somebody â€“ you tell a woman, like, you know, I'll have sex with you.  I'll have sex with you for 30 hours.  Like, you know, everybody knows you're making a ludicrous exaggeration just for humor.  Maybe you.  Yeah, well, yeah.  He made a very strong offer.  I accepted it strongly.  And we'll see what happens.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it'll be up to a judge.  And I'll tell you something.  I've had lawyers that agree with me 100 percent.  And then I've had some that don't agree.  I mean, it's really going to be up to a judge to make a determination. 
[01:48:30]  Well, I have had some really good lawyers saying, you know, you have a really good case.  Have a case, yeah.  But the point here is you want Bill Maher to suffer.  Exactly.  You know, I don't care about Bill Maher.  I know nothing about Bill Maher.  He's an ass.  We met him once, and he certainly, we did not hit it off.  Well, he's not.  We did not hit it off.  I can tell you on my Twitter, I have so many people saying, please pursue that.  Please pursue that.  We saw it.  He owes you that money, meaning he owes the charities that money. 
[01:49:00]  I mean, he's not very popular.  I don't know how he does in the ratings.  I have no idea if he gets good ratings.  I don't know.  He makes me want HBO to bring back Arliss.  It's a horrible, horrible show.  Well, I don't think he's a great guy.  No, he's not.  He goes around under the guise of, you know, this really smart guy, but I don't think he's  a smart guy.  And I'm pretty good at that stuff.  I watch people.  I can understand people.  I made a lot of money by judging people.  You know, it's like people could say I got good locations.  I mean, the truth is I make money by judging people. 
[01:49:30]  He is not a smart guy.  So we'll see what happens.  Wait, wait.  You judge people?  What do you think of us?  Are we smart people?  We're smart, right?  What a show.  What a show.  What a combination.  Some partnership.  Man, that must be a tough one.  That was...  Wait, do you sense sarcasm there?  A little bit?  A little bit.  A little bit.  I think it's great.  Well, this is fantastic.  I like the Celebrity Apprentice lineup.  Yeah, know who we like a lot?  Again, Penn Jillette.  Yeah, Penn Jillette is... 
[01:50:00]  A lot of people like Penn.  Yeah, he's on our show a lot.  He kills for us.  He's a smart guy.  Real smart guy.  He was doing fine in Las Vegas.  And then about two years ago, as you know, he went on Celebrity Apprentice.  And his show went from doing okay, you know, he's doing okay.  It was a lot of...  To being where you can't even get a ticket.  And so he did very, very well.  And he's a nice guy.  And he's smart.  So we'll see what...  We'll see how it all happens.  I can tell you he does do well.  I mean, he's a very cunning cookie.  I got to ask you one. 
[01:50:30]  I don't know if we ever asked you this.  We're pretty...  No, no, no.  Not bad.  Not bad.  We're really close with Andrew Dice Clay.  Right.  Why wouldn't you leave him on the show just because he's going to make good TV for you?  Can I be honest?  I love that guy.  And I had to make a decision early on with The Apprentice.  You know, we've had now 16 copies.  Because as you saw on CBS the other day, there was a show called The Job.  I used to say 15 copies.  They all failed immediately.  Many, many people did copies, knockoffs of The Apprentice.  Well, they did another one.  And it was on for the last couple of weeks. 
[01:51:00]  And it was called The Job on CBS.  Yeah.  It just got canceled.  So now I'm proud to say...  And I love that.  You know, I love when that happens.  I love it.  It's like you guys.  You know, don't you love to see your opponents fail?  Yes.  Of course.  I love to see when the ratings come out how well you do and other guys are dying.  And you know they're going to be canceled.  Well, I love it.  Yeah.  Well, I love it.  So they had the job and that failed.  But the truth is, I made a decision a long time ago, right at the beginning.  Can you believe this is 10 years of great ratings?  Number one show on...  10 years? 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  10 years.  Can you believe it?  Jesus.  This is the 13th season.  Some seasons they had two on.  Wow.  But we're now in the 10th year, which is hard to believe.  Wow.  And it continues to do great.  So I made a decision.  Do I do this show for entertainment or do I do it for, you know, for...  I have to have credibility.  Andrew, I think he's fabulous.  He was great.  The problem is, there was nobody else I could have fired that night.  So if I would have fired somebody else that, frankly, would have been, you know, less entertainment  value, I would have lost credibility. 
[01:52:00]  So I really made the decision a long time ago, I have to go with the...  Like, when I fired Dennis Rodman, I hated to fire Dennis Rodman.  I mean, how great was Dennis Rodman?  He was great.  Terrific.  He was amazing entertainment.  When I fired Gary Busey, people said, oh...  Oh, terrific, though.  They were begging me to keep Gary Busey.  I couldn't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  But I have him back on, and I have Dennis Rodman back on on Sunday night.  So I really made a decision that I have to do the right thing as opposed to what's good 
[01:52:30]  for entertainment.  And ultimately, that gave me and the show credibility, and I think that's maybe one of the reasons.  But you're right.  He's a friend of yours, Andrew.  And he was fabulous.  Well, we're not even trying to defend him.  We just know he makes just great TV wherever he goes.  Oh, he was great.  I mean, he was really good, and I hated to do it.  I mean, there were three or four people that, frankly, I would have loved to have gotten  rid of because they weren't exciting people.  Yeah, yeah.  But if I did it, people would have said, how the hell did you do that one? 
[01:53:00]  Right.  You understand.  Yes.  Why no Clay Aiken?  Too whiny?  You had him with his whining?  I could have.  No, I could have had him back.  We didn't ask him.  You know, we actually, everybody we asked, we got.  Yes.  Because, you know, we asked people that really resonated and did well.  And we talk about Romney.  You know, Romney was interesting because he didn't resonate.  He was a nice man, didn't resonate.  Well, some people don't resonate.  And these people were great people, and that's why we call it the All-Stars.  Yeah.  And I think it's going to be great. 
[01:53:30]  Shark Tank, what's your thoughts?  We just had Mark Cuban in here the other day.  Well, Mark Cuban went around, I guess, on one of your friends' shows.  You know, Howard, I don't know.  I think, are you friends with Howard?  We're in the same building.  We have an understanding, I guess.  Well, he went on and he said, oh, but Shark Tank got better.  Well, what we did is we did a thing called Nielsen.  We sent the ratings in, and, you know, now all of a sudden nobody talks about that.  Oh, shit.  The Nielsen ratings are much better for The Apprentice.  And, by the way, that's after 13 seasons. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  And last year we went against the Academy Awards.  We went against the biggest shows on television, and we still, you know, blew Shark Tank away.  Shark Tank's a Friday show, which, you know, which Friday is?  It's called Death Valley Friday.  Yeah, yeah.  Friday.  You know what?  It does fine on Friday.  It does fine.  But, you know, Mark was making statements that weren't true.  So what we did is we sent in the Nielsen ratings, and everybody apologized.  How do you deal with that Piers Morgan guy?  Well, he's terrific.  Look.  Oh, boy.  I think he's terrific. 
[01:54:30]  I mean, you know, people don't like him, and some people like him.  But he came in.  Nobody knew him.  Went on The Apprentice.  Showed how smart he was.  There's an example of somebody that was really, really smart.  Now, he was in the finale against Trace, okay?  Trace Adkins.  And Trace was really popular.  And Piers was less popular.  But, I mean, Piers just blew it out of the park.  And, anyway, he wins.  And then he gets Larry King, and he gets, you know, he was on America's Got Talent. 
[01:55:00]  But he deserves it.  He's a very smart guy.  I don't like some Brit telling me what I can and can't use as far as defending myself, Donald.  But can I tell you what?  He's a very, very smart guy and a very good guy.  And I'm proud of the fact that he did so well.  Joan Rivers.  Look at Joan Rivers.  Her career was dead.  I mean, she said it.  I love Donald.  That's true.  I mean, her career.  Sure, sure.  She actually did a thing where, you know, she showed the diary and she had nothing in there.  And she went on to Apprentice and won.  You don't only have to win.  Like, as an example, Trace Adkins came in second. 
[01:55:30]  When he was on the show, nobody knew who the hell he was.  And during the show, he had the number one album.  During the show, the number one, I guess, country album.  He went to number one.  He's one of the top country stars.  So it's been really good for these people.  And I think, importantly, there is, you know, millions of dollars for charity during the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Why no Meatloaf?  You had it with his crying?  We would have.  I think Meatloaf was on tour, so we didn't even bother with that.  But we will probably have Meatloaf back at some time. 
[01:56:00]  He was, you know, he was a funny guy because, you know, you cover Meatloaf.  He was the most emotional guy I've ever seen.  He was ridiculous.  Yeah.  You'd see Meatloaf and you'd see this big sort of tough guy.  Yeah.  Every time he got into a fight, he started crying.  Yeah.  He'd start crying, yes.  His passion was unbelievable.  He was great, though.  He could not have been better.  And I would imagine that we will have him back someday.  Very cool.  And the show's a little, you've got a lot of advisors this year, too.  You've got Arsenio Hall's an advisor, Piers Morgan, Joan Rivers, John Rich, your son, Donald Trump Jr., 
[01:56:30]  who's going to be in here tomorrow.  Oh, good.  We're kind of pals with him.  And we have Ivanka, who does great.  Ivanka, who's beautiful, by the way.  But we're doing that.  We're taking the winners.  And, you know, Bret Michaels was also a winner.  And I think he made a terrible mistake, but we'll find out.  He decided that he wanted to go on the show again.  Now, that's a little bit like Muhammad Ali.  You know, you win the heavyweight championship, and then six years later, you want to come back and fight again, right?  It's probably for the same reason. 
[01:57:00]  They missed the spotlight.  It's hard to not be in the spotlight.  And I said, you know, you can come back as you should.  No, no, I want to go on the show.  Now, you know, the chances, you would think the chances aren't that great, right?  I mean, how old is he so much better?  He's a very good guy.  He's a very talented guy.  But he wanted to raise money for the charity, and you can't do that as the judge, as you can imagine.  But I think he took a very big risk, but we're going to find out.  I would not have done that if I were him.  Yeah, I want to change topics.  The Pope, it's his last day. 
[01:57:30]  What's your feeling with that whole thing?  I think it's terrible that he resigned.  You know, it's funny.  I get used to old Popes that were bent over and practiced.  That's true, yes.  I thought they were great, like Pope John.  I mean, you know, I mean, the poor guy could hardly even stand up.  And they put him in that glass cage, and he'd be bent over.  And, you know, he was great.  And you say, it's our Pope.  I love him.  The fact is, I think this guy made a terrible mistake.  I just don't think, you know, we talk about resonating.  I don't think he ever resonated great as a Pope. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's not going to go down.  I thought Pope John did.  Of course.  I thought that, I happen to be Christian.  I thought that this man was, you know, never at the top of the heap.  I always, I loved Pope John.  Even at the end, I mean, he was so tired.  He was excited.  He really was.  He was in there pitching.  I think, and now, you know, you could say it isn't the first time, because it happened  six or seven hundred years ago where somebody resigned. 
[01:58:30]  Sure.  I think we got used to, you know, a lot of times they say you're retired at a certain age,  right?  I think we got used to Pope's not retiring.  Yeah, that's what happened.  You know, they just held it until the end of their lives.  It's like an executive in a company that all of a sudden quits.  And then you say, oh, what's wrong with that company?  And the stock goes down, right?  Right.  You know, people sort of say, well, what's wrong?  And I just, you know, my, when I heard he was leaving, I said, oh, boy, they really  have problems.  Yeah.  I just think it was a terrible thing to do.  For him and for the church, I think it's a very bad thing. 
[01:59:00]  Uh, Donald, I also want to ask you, uh, official, uh, statement on, uh, Melissa King, of course,  Miss Teen Delaware, uh, USA.  Well, she, uh, she was in porno movies and she actually resigned.  She had no choice.  Yeah.  It's too bad.  It's too bad.  You know, they signed documents and, and this whole pageant system, my own Miss Universe,  Miss USA, Miss Teen USA.  Right.  And they're very successful.  And, you know, I, I tell you what, I give them and their parents tremendous credit because 
[01:59:30]  some of these girls are just amazing.  They're brought up so beautifully and everything.  Anyway, she was in a heavy, heavy porno stuff.  Yes.  I saw the video, uh, Mr. Trump.  Was it as heavy as I've heard?  I had to.  The words you're looking for is great.  I had to look, uh, based on, you know, my, my journalistic integrity.  I didn't want to comment on it until I had seen it five or six times.  And was, in other words, you viewed it many, many times?  Yes, I wanted to make sure I, I got the full impact of it and knew what maybe her frame 
[02:00:00]  of mind was of this whole thing.  I actually, in all honesty, I feel bad for the girl.  It's, uh.  How bad was it?  It's, um, extremely graphic, um, and pretty much has all the features of, um, a hardcore  pornography, uh, feature.  Yeah.  So you can't say it was like a little mistake?  No, no, no.  Nothing like that.  And, and, uh.  It was an immediate resignation, so she obviously knew, uh.  Uh, yeah, I guess her lawyers were saying that it's not her, but it's so her.  Yeah, you, you can really tell. 
[02:00:30]  You've met her?  I mean, obviously?  I think I've taken a picture with her.  In fact, my picture is with her all over the world.  Oh, boy.  You know, because I, I take pictures with all of them.  And, uh, she, uh, it's too bad.  It's a very pretty girl.  Very, you know, girl next door-ish.  I think she would have, you know, had a good career there.  But it's something that has to happen.  You know, the, I don't know, do you remember a number of years ago, the, we call it the  answer.  It was one of the great answers of all time.  One of the most beautiful girls.  You remember that girl, the blonde girl from North or South Carolina? 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  Who gave this answer about something.  It was like about education.  And she went all over the place.  She was so beautiful that, and I remember Letterman saying, okay, that was a great answer.  Let's play together.  They played it.  Oh, man.  Only because her beauty was so incredible.  Right.  Anyway, in this case, you have no choice.  And I heard it was very graphic.  I have not seen it, but I heard it was great.  Oh, Donald, you, you really should, uh, before you comment on it, you should, uh, you should  scream.  It's official business. 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  I think you guys have been around the corner.  I think I can trust you to give me a good answer.  All right.  I think based on what you said, I don't have to see it.  Yes, yes.  I'll tell you what.  I'll watch it a couple more times for you.  You'll be my advisor.  All right.  Hey, can I tell you, you've already advised me.  I have.  Okay.  Very good.  I like that.  Well, we should let the Donald go.  Yes, of course.  Uh, Donald Trump, a celebrity apprentice, all stars, uh, this Sunday, 9 p.m. NBC.  The lineup looks great.  I mean, they're all the people that have, um, had such great, uh, uh, personalities on, 
[02:02:00]  on, uh, prior apprentices.  So, uh, it should be really fun.  Absolutely.  It will be.  And I really appreciate it, fellas.  And, uh, good luck with everything.  Keep it up and I'll talk to you the next cycle or whatever.  Yeah, sounds great.  Thanks, uh, Donald.  All right.  Donald Trump, everyone.  He's entertaining us all.  He's hilarious.  Yeah, it's hard because there's things I don't like about him and there's things I really  do like about him.  Yeah, exactly.  But that's how everyone feels about Donald Trump.  And you, you know, and a lot of people, though, either hate him or love him. 
[02:02:30]  No, I love how he just kills everybody.  He's hilarious.  He does talk a lot of shit, which I respect.  He said no one knew Trace Adkins.  I know.  I love him.  Then why would he be on The Celebrity Apprentice?  All of his statements are definite.  Yeah, I know.  I know he was.  Yeah, Joe Rivers, her career was in the toilet.  Yeah, there's no wiggle room.  Her career was done.  Be careful what we say about him, though, because he might end up trashing us.  Yeah.  He goes like, well, you know, Bill Maher, he's not a smart guy.  You guys know this, right? 
[02:03:00]  That's great, though.  He knows exactly what he's doing with Bill Maher.  He's just trying to make it hurt.  Yeah, I think so, too.  He's just trying to make it hurt a little bit.  I think it makes him look really petty, though.  It's like, and I think he's, it's like, I think it's, come on, man, you're too smart  a guy to not know that was said in mockery and humor.  And when you start throwing out lawsuits, like, you know, if someone is saying something,  you know, Donald Trump stole the, that's different.  That's a genuinely damaging statement.  You know, Donald Trump ripped me off.  All right, that's a real damaging thing you're sued for. 
[02:03:30]  You know what, though?  For somebody like Bill Maher, who has trashed Donald Trump over the years, I think it's  refreshing to see someone in his position take that turnaround as, as anybody would like  to do.  If you're in that position, you would love to be able to go, you know what?  I'm going to fucking turn around.  I'm going to get the publicity machine rolling, and I'm going to stick it to this guy, even  though I don't think it's going to go through.  It's going to be a pain in the ass for him.  Good.  I kind of like that.  No, no, I understand the emotion behind it, and I would probably feel the same way if 
[02:04:00]  I was him.  I just think that it gets to a point where I want to, come on, man, you know better.  You're too smart, and you're a guy that fires a lot of, what's the word, you fire a lot  of bombs at people.  And it's great that he does it.  I mean, that's one of the things I enjoy about Trump.  I think he's careful enough not to open his mouth to maybe, perhaps, be liable for a  million, a few million dollars.  But again, as you know, anybody can sue anybody for anything.  And listening to Trump talk, my take on it was as a guy who, just an opinion of having 
[02:04:30]  listened, I believed that he knows exactly what it is.  I do too.  And I think that Bill Maher got a big laugh when he said that.  And even if you don't like Maher, no reasonable person thinks that Bill Maher genuinely made  an offer that, I think your mother's an orangutan.  It's a mean thing to say, and it's not, sure.  And you know, Trump obviously loves his mother, and he feels the need to defend her.  Yeah.  But come on, you can't, it's almost like running and telling your mom that somebody was, you 
[02:05:00]  go to school and you make fun of everybody, and then somebody makes fun of you, and you  try to get them out of technicality and get them in detention.  It's like, come on, what are you doing?  He's just turning the screws.  He's just trying to make it hurt a little bit.  And the weird part is, none of this stuff sticks with him.  No.  You know, he gets himself into all sorts of situations.  It's entertaining.  It doesn't seem to affect him in the end.  It fits his personality.  He fits in this weird place between businessman, because that's what he is.  He's not cast as a developer and a businessman. 
[02:05:30]  He is.  But he's also a personality, an entertainer, you know?  And it's like, as long as he's suing Bill Maher, the story's ongoing, which means every  time he does an appearance, somebody's going to end up asking, which means he can continue  to say how stupid he is and just take shots.  It could be a work.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a work.  For him...  All he does is cut promos.  He's cutting promos constantly when he talks. 
[02:06:00]  It sounds like he's fucking cut wrestling promos.  You're right.  It's a work.  We know that.  But he's not in on it with Bill Maher or something.  He just works everyone.  He wants to stress out Bill a little bit.  Right.  He knows exactly what he's doing.  Photographer's been out there for.  I don't know.  We're big stars, I guess.  He has a great promo guy.  His PR people are fucking genius.  Or it might just be him thinking this stuff up.  He's really smart.  He's smart when it comes to self-promotion, man.  Dude, he got himself into the presidential race talk.  I know.  Right.  Fucking host the apprentice.  I don't know if I'm going to run. 
[02:06:30]  Will he run?  These dummies pick it up and go.  You could pass by a fuckload of buildings in every city and see names on top of them.  That Chicago building we were in recently was ridiculous how nice it was.  I'm talking like other developers that you wouldn't know their name from fucking anybody.  This guy has eked out this weird place in history and in entertainment.  I don't know about culture.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't agree with a bunch of things he says.  I don't know.  But I fucking love him.  Yeah.  I fucking love him. 
[02:07:00]  He doesn't mind.  Even when he was trashing us, I loved him still.  He doesn't mind saying stuff.  He knows people will be like, I hate you so much.  You're a fucking asshole.  Because he's a heel.  He's almost a shock jock.  He's almost an old school shock jock.  But this guy is like a billionaire.  He reminds me of Ann Coulter in a way.  He doesn't say the extreme stuff.  Right.  But he says stuff that a lot of people don't like unapologetically and he never backs up.  No.  And that is something I like about it.  That's why I don't like the lawsuit thing.  Because he goes after people and I respect that. 
[02:07:30]  I had at least ten hard laughs in that conversation.  It's so funny.  The way he does.  Joan Rivers.  What did he say?  Dead.  Dead or in the toilet?  No, dead.  He was dead.  Dead.  Nobody knew who Trace Adkins was.  Yeah, yeah.  But he was a celebrity for a celebrity apprentice.  Why would he put a...  Penn could barely eke out tickets to his shows until he was on there.  And now they're just like...  And meet love with a crybaby crying all the time.  You know, Penn, he was doing all right.  Not great.  But he had a Vegas show.  You know, he had his Vegas show. 
[02:08:00]  But then...  Now he can't get a ticket.  He's had a 30-year career in shows.  I fucking...  Penn Jillette.  I saw Penn.  I saw Penn long before he was on Apprentice.  Packed house.  Yeah.  People have known Penn since the 80s.  Of course.  Penn and Teller are one of the most famous magic teams ever.  Yes, of course.  Every television show they were on...  I'm sure it helped Penn's business, but he didn't really need, you know, help.  No.  No, I think he's doing fine.  Oh, it's great.  I love it.  Donald.  I fucking love it.  What did he say about Shark Tank?  It's in Death Valley. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, he said he said he...  It's on Fridays, and you know what Fridays are in television.  Yeah.  Death Valley.  Death Valley.  I mean, so they took the Nielsen's to them, and they apologized or something.  Yeah, took the Nielsen's, and now you don't hear about, you know, this competition between  the shows.  He goes, we have a thing in ratings called the Nielsen's.  Nielsen's.  We showed them, and that's it.  You don't hear from them anymore.  Yeah.  And he's so not, like, a good winner when he goes, like, yeah, CBS just canceled that  show, and I think that's great.  Yeah, he feels good about it. 
[02:09:00]  That's what I love about him.  There's no phony, hey, too bad.  I love the fact that he says that.  He's pretty honest.  We got a son coming in tomorrow, Donald Trump Jr.  Your son.  And next, Jesse Joyce, who just wrote for the Oscars for Seth MacFarlane, man.  Yeah, he's a funny fuck.  We had him on a while ago.  He's coming back to say hi.  We'll talk to him next.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  On Sirius XM.  Coming soon to Broadway, Jim Norton of The Opie and Anthony Show stars as that lovable 
[02:09:30]  redheaded orphan in the new production of Annie.  The sun will come out.  Come on, Jimmy.  Tomorrow, you're going to lay in bed and die of cancer tomorrow.  Like Yul Brynner.  Oh, you used to be fun in the sun.  But now you're shitting in your bed.  And your head is full of mush like Lyle Alzado.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:10:00]  What is this?  What is this, E-Rock? 
[02:10:30]  I thought it was a bed for a live read or something.  No, it's Eminem.  This is Eminem?  It's a loop of Eminem.  Because I thought you were bringing the guest in.  That's why I didn't play a hook or anything.  Yeah, we're going to bring Jesse Joyce in.  Of course we are.  Oh.  He's playing Anchorage?  Alaska?  Alaska.  We have nobody outside to bring Jesse Joyce in.  That's crazy.  What the fuck are we doing?  Oh, boy.  A radio show.  I see the doorknob just turned.  There he is.  Jesse. 
[02:11:00]  Jesse Joyce.  How are you?  Take a seat, sir.  We haven't seen you in a while, bro.  Yeah.  I've been out in L.A. the whole time.  Yeah.  Are you really playing Alaska?  I am indeed.  Yeah.  This week.  Coming up.  How's that working out for you?  It's fucking great, dude.  Is it really?  What?  Yeah.  Performing at this club, it's like a pirate ship.  Yeah.  It's just amputees and scary.  You don't ask anybody about their past in Alaska.  Yeah.  You just get this sense.  Yeah, because they're there for something.  Yeah, this club.  They're definitely running.  It's called Chill Kill Charlie's.  It's like a famous place up there. 
[02:11:30]  And the last time I was up there.  There's a club or bar?  It's a series of bars all together.  And they have showrooms where they do.  Nice.  So the last time I was there, they told me in advance, they're like, we're a little short-staffed  bouncer-wise.  So just watch your own back.  And the reason is because two of the guys were on probation because they killed a guy  in the parking lot.  And another dude was having surgery because he had his ear bitten off by a customer.  For real.  In the same week.  Bad Alaska.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's pretty great. 
[02:12:00]  Well, how long is the flight, first of all?  Oh, like 12 hours.  12 hours.  Just for the weekend?  For the week.  Oh, you're going to go for the week?  They kind of get your...  The reason they find it agreeable, they really work you the whole...  Like, I have a show every night for seven days.  And every night is...  Every day is every night, too, right?  Isn't it still dark there?  I think, yeah.  It's going to be...  I think now is the period where it's going to be a few hours of one or the other.  It gets a little dusky and then a little light and then it's just dark again.  Why did you come back here instead of just going right from L.A.? 
[02:12:30]  Because I hate L.A. so much that I had to get it out of my system.  Like, I had to spend a couple days in New York, you know?  How cold is it in Alaska?  I think it's in the 30s now or whatever.  Oh, that's it?  Yeah.  It's not terrible.  It's so cold.  Let me tell you.  No, my favorite thing about that club is there's like a little...  It's just a crazy place.  You know, it's all like...  There's wood chips on the floor and puke everywhere and whatever.  It sounds cold, to be honest with you.  It's great.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a midget who works the door, wears a tuxedo, and he checks people through the metal detector.  And there's a little sign by his little kiosk where he takes IDs. 
[02:13:00]  There's this grizzled, like, Nom Vet-looking Alaskan dude with, like, a crazy eye and, like, a flak jacket.  And underneath it, like, handwritten and a magic marker, there's a photo of the guy.  And then it says, do not let him in.  He is a murderer.  Oh, wow.  Like, that's what they do to murderers in Alaska.  Like, get out of here, murderer.  You know?  You should have thought of that before you murdered somebody.  They don't have laws.  It's awesome.  Yeah, there is.  Like, I've watched some of those shows.  Like, the Alaska State Troopers show.  Yeah, yeah.  Where it's, like, one trooper has to cover 18 million square miles of shit and the ice road trucker guys and all that. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  It's just a place that if you're there, you did something where you are not allowed to be anywhere civilized anymore.  Yeah.  So they throw you up there.  Walking down the street with a shotgun.  Like, I was with the club owner.  We were walking down to go get lunch.  Guy with a shotgun, like, just slung over his shoulder.  He's like, hey, good to meet you.  You know, like that.  It's like fucking Deadwood.  It's amazing up there.  It's really interesting. 
[02:14:00]  Is it modern or is it one of these cities that looks kind of old?  Yeah, it looks old.  It does look old.  Yeah.  I mean, they have cell phones and whatnot.  No, I understand that.  But, I mean, but they're not building new shit for the most part.  No, not for the most part.  It probably looks like gold.  I want to go in New York because it's always weather-beaten places like that.  Like, the hotel probably looks beaten up wherever you stay.  It's got to look beaten up.  Oh, you stay in a cabin.  It's awesome.  Wow.  Why are you literally saying it?  It's adventurous.  Jimmy, you should go.  Should I?  It's fun.  No.  If you want to do this, I'd be happy to do this. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I have a hotel.  But if I, like, decided to make a big deal out of it, they probably would put me there.  But, like, I like the cabin.  That's cool.  Yeah.  A little adventure, man.  You're going to be there all week.  What do you do in between shows?  You can, like, drive out.  Are you one of these comics that gets out of your room and does shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.  Or you just kind of hibernate?  Yeah, there's a place.  I think they closed it, but it was the greatest.  It's, like, an hour outside of Anchorage.  And this, like, 88-year-old guy, he's, like, this old German dude who has, which, by the  way, is the perfect age to be hiding out, I'd like to point out. 
[02:15:00]  I'm, like, 88 years old in Alaska, Germany.  Anyway, he runs a wolf rescue.  Like, he just grabs wolves that were, like, hit by a car and, like, nurses them back to  health.  Wow.  And then he has them in his backyard.  And the guy's got nine fingers because a wolf took one of them, literally.  And he just walks you around the yard and, like, tells you which ones you're allowed  to pet and which ones are going to kill you.  You know, like, that kind of thing.  Do they bite him or no?  No, no, not at all.  Well, I mean, they have in the past.  It's like, he's all scarred up and whatever, but for the most part, like, he has, like, 
[02:15:30]  a rapport with the wolves, you know?  They're the ones.  He, he, his, his farm is what, like, movies use.  So, like, wolves you see in movies tend to be from this guy's place, you know?  Right.  And he gets the hybrids, right?  Like, people who think they could raise one of these animals and realize, holy fuck, they  are wild beasts.  Yeah, yeah.  So they, they ditch the animals and then a guy like this.  Right, and then he takes them.  He takes them.  Yeah, and he's got, like, just...  Supposedly the hybrids are the worst when you're trying to fucking mix the two breeds.  Yeah, he's got, like, this patter, too, like, that, you know, because it's, like, a tourist 
[02:16:00]  place, like, you know, the Anchorage tourism will send you up there.  Like, oh, you got to go see this guy, right?  So you go up there and, like, but he's 88, so it's, like, you can see him, like, going  through the motions of the jokes that he has in his little rat-a-tat, but he's, like,  lost it because he's, so, and he'll be, like, okay, you'll go ahead, you'll put that  one, but not that one.  No, wait!  It's this one, but not the, like, literally, he fucks it up and you're, like, I'm not, you have  nine figures, dude.  I made a mistake.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  Are you a Jewish? 
[02:16:30]  Wow, yeah, that's a lot of alcoholics up there, too, apparently, huh?  Yes, indeed.  The drinking is, like, all you can do up there.  Actually, I think this is around the time of year, because I was there once before, like,  sometime in March, and that's when it starts to thaw, and every day in the newspaper, there's,  like, three new dead bodies.  Oh, because they're under the snow.  Yeah, exactly, right.  They just, like, find a crumpled-up guy with a whiskey bottle in his hand, you know what I mean?  Like, just under a snow bank on a sidewalk that they didn't see before. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  That's wild.  How much snow do they get?  I mean, I know Alaska's snow, but, I mean, how much do they get in the winter?  It's fucking old.  I, that's not, I'm not a meteorologist.  Oh, yeah, but I don't know the answer to that specifically.  I don't know why I'm asking you the fucking, yeah, really, who was the mayor of Juneau?  You guys doing a gig, what a cunt I am.  Now, the annual precipitation.  I know.  It's amazing how somebody can become an expert in my eyes.  I'm wearing a sweatshirt that says Alaska, so you're like, oh, this guy is. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, what's their biggest export, Jesse?  You're really into Alaska.  You're playing there, you got a hoodie on that says Alaska.  Because I just literally moved back to New York after three, like, last night I got in,  and so I just threw on the only, but I do feel like the guy at the concert with the band  talking about it.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You got the fucking Alaska jam.  Well, we got to ask you about the Oscars.  How did you feel it went for Seth?  I thought it went great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought, and everybody who's, like, in the industry, like, anybody who's a humorist  or comic or whatever, like, they all get it.  It's just like the fat housewives that hated it, you know? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And he basically said, I'm done.  Go find someone else.  Yeah, well, he said that before.  Oh, really?  Before the Oscars were even...  But he brought in the numbers.  They were looking for the younger demos, and he brought them in.  Right, yeah.  He said exactly where they were looking for growth.  One of his tweets was perfect.  He said it's like the Kobayashi Maru from Star Trek, Rathakhan.  You do it, it's a no-win scenario, because if you do well, some people like you, but then  some people hate you.  Right.  I think he did a great job. 
[02:18:30]  He looks the part.  Yeah.  He sounds great.  I thought he was funny.  And he had some good jokes that didn't seem like the ones that you just, you know, here's  the writer, put it on the teleprompter, let this guy that doesn't know how to deliver  it, deliver it.  I thought he sounded great.  And of course, the one I knew came from Jesse.  I called it.  Which one?  It's pretty sweet.  Oh.  The John Wilkes Booth one.  The one.  That was yours.  The famous one.  That's got to be, that's fucking, Jesse's written enough stuff for me, and I've watched  him enough to know that, and no one else would write that for the Oscars, but this 
[02:19:00]  fucking shit.  I like that.  No, great joke.  Let me ask you about that.  That John Wilkes Booth trended worldwide on Twitter as a result of that joke.  I was so proud of that.  Now, let me ask you about that.  So you present that joke to him.  Were you a little worried?  No, no, no.  He's pretty edgy.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  It was more like we all collectively were trying to find the line, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Because it was a...  It's like this joke there.  But was he really excited?  Like, okay, this is it.  This is the one.  Yeah, well, actually, no.  I didn't even know necessarily that he was going to pick. 
[02:19:30]  Like, you know, I just churned out stuff and threw them into the void, like just into  this giant joke bank, and, you know, he was the one who called through them and  picked them, so.  How many of yours were used?  I don't know.  Maybe like 15, something like that.  Somewhere in that range.  Look at them casually.  I don't know.  15 of my jokes were heard by a billion people.  But the thing is, like, I don't know for sure, because I was backstage the whole time,  so I wasn't...  So I haven't seen them.  Were you also writing as the show was going on?  No, like, that was the intention.  That's why he wanted us all backstage, but it's such an enormous machine that once it 
[02:20:00]  starts, there's no, like, you know, for the roast.  So you saw everybody walk back?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're just in the way.  Like, I'm just in Liam Neeson's way the whole time, you know?  And he's, like, trying to get around me.  And, you know, like, I ended up, like, I was standing on...  Dip your sushi in his hair?  Yeah, yeah.  Who's the one with the shovel face, uh, chick?  Oh, uh, not Renee Zellweger, the other one.  The one who looks just like her.  Reese Witherspoon.  Yes, Reese Witherspoon.  Reese Witherspoon.  Yeah, with her square weird head.  With her weird chin. 
[02:20:30]  I was, like, standing on her dress.  You know, like, just shit like that happens the whole time.  Like, you know, I was waiting to go to the bathroom and Michael Douglas is clearing his  fucked up throat behind me, like, waiting to piss, you know, like, that kind of thing  the whole time.  But you can't get any pictures back there, right?  No, it would have been, like...  Really awkward.  Well, see, I don't know how you do it.  Like, you do it all the time.  Like, I just...  I don't know the protocol, so it would have just been weird.  No, back there, I might not backstage.  You could see it would look weird.  You would have tried, Jimmy.  Maybe with one.  Like, if De Niro was back there, I would have asked De Niro.  You would have definitely tried.  With this one, I would have been willing to get thrown out for.  Did you go to any of the parties or no? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I got to go to the Governor's Ball, which is, like, the big one, you know?  Wait, what else about the Oscars themselves, though?  Uh, it seemed to go pretty smoothly, but, like, that's the thing, is, like, we were back...  Like, with, like, the roasts or whatever, you know, they just come backstage, you can  just pitch out a joke, like, uh, you know, because somebody said something, then...  And that was why we were there, just, like, in case Tarantino said nigger or whatever.  Like, that was just the assumption that we'd all be there to cover for that, because...  Right.  Which, by the way, did you see it?  Like, he looked like he was giving a drunk best man speech.  Oh, yeah.  His tie was all loose and he was swaying around. 
[02:21:30]  We love him.  We were totally like, it's coming, you know?  But he's already in place by the time.  So there's, like, nothing for us to do other than just kind of...  Just, uh, look at the stars.  Yeah, and, like, try not to bother anyone.  Which was the one, uh, person you saw where you were like, holy fuck, that's, that's a  fucking huge celebrity.  Well, Charlize Theron is, like, that hot in person.  She's amazing, right?  I was inches from her.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen her in restaurants and it's like, I just want to walk up and go, look, I know  you don't know me, but I kind of love you.  Excuse me, we saw Charlize Theron. 
[02:22:00]  Where?  Wasn't she?  She was the one on our couch at NDW before she was famous.  Before she was really famous.  Really famous, yeah, yeah.  She was hanging with the guy from, uh, we told this story a bunch of times, uh, the Jumper  song, the fucking Suicide song, the fucking Help Me Out.  Oh, the Drowning Pool.  No, no, no, no.  If I've been around...  Yeah, yeah, third eye blind.  Third eye blind.  Thank you, Chuck.  And we were pussies back then because, uh, the third eye blind guy, who was kind of a 
[02:22:30]  dick to us, by the way, so fuck him.  He basically told us, like, look, man, I don't really want you bringing up that, you know,  she's here.  Because I think she just made, uh, which one?  Devil's Advocate or something?  Oh, that's a big one.  Oh, right, she was in.  Yeah!  But they didn't know, but she wasn't a household name yet.  Right.  Because she was on her way.  Right.  And he basically said, you know, I don't really want you bringing up that I brought  her here.  And she just sat on the couch, all innocent, and just fucking looking hot and shit.  Did you get the hugger?  No.  No, I didn't.  I almost, I almost did anyway, though.  You should have just put your arms out, like, come on. 
[02:23:00]  You know you want to.  See you again.  Phony Hollywood, she went and hugged you.  Oh, my God, there was so much of that shit.  Just, like, I just overheard somebody, just some douche, like, Hollywood-looking asshole,  just like, who doesn't love Hugh Jackman?  Everybody loves Hugh, like, two Hugh Jackman.  Oh, no.  Talking about somebody in the third person to them is such a dumb Hollywood thing to  do.  Oh, my God.  You know what I mean?  Jesse makes a point.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, right.  Like, yeah, you know, that's why everybody loves Jimmy.  You know?  Like, it's just horrible.  That's brutal.  No one who was depressing to see was Renee Zellweger. 
[02:23:30]  She has aged, man.  Right.  I know it happens to everybody, but she's had a rough couple years or something.  She's almost unrecognizable.  I mean, Meryl Streep.  I really didn't see her.  Renee Zellweger.  Oh, I thought she looked okay, no?  But she looked a lot fucking different, man.  Right?  Yeah.  She's cool, though.  I actually had to take her on a tour of the Comedy Cellar once for some movie or whatever.  And I don't even know why they called me, but the seller called me and were like, hey,  would you bring Renee Zellweger around?  So I did.  Was she hot at the time?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I always had a little thing. 
[02:24:00]  Did she jerk you off in the car?  No, she did not.  Did she jerk you off?  What the hell?  I think, to be honest with you, I'd be a little self-conscious if she has that lemon face.  It would make it look like, what's wrong with my dick?  Well, she had to keep getting fat and skinny for that Bridget Jones diary shit.  It's got to take its toll on you.  That's her from the Oscars?  Yeah, she's pretty hot.  She looks good there.  This is from the red carpet.  We're looking at a picture.  Yeah, I thought she looked good.  But when she was on the Oscars doing her little thing, she looked a little haggard. 
[02:24:30]  Did you see Meryl Streep backstage?  I did not.  That would have been cool.  Yeah, she looked rather old.  No, like the people that...  I ended up smoking a cigarette next to Robert Downey Jr. like four different times.  Because I kept sneaking out to go have a smoke.  And it's the same place that they would go out and sneak out and have a smoke.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's smoking these days as celebrities?  Pretty much Robert Downey Jr.  Just Robert Downey Jr.  And me.  We were the two.  You know.  Talk to him?  Just like perfunctory.  I didn't want to be that guy.  Because a lot of times too, like in airports, smoking lounges. 
[02:25:00]  None of you guys smoke, right?  I know you guys used to.  Yeah.  People feel this need to chat with each other when they're having a cigarette.  And it's always like they don't have anything.  So it's like about smoking.  It's the lamest fucking...  Just because you're having a cigarette, you're in the smoking lounge.  And people will be like, this is ridiculous, right?  You know, like they want me to join some fucking...  Coalition.  Yeah, yeah, exactly, right?  No, you should have said that.  He would have said, what do you mean?  You would have said, the fact that blacks were allowed in here.  It's goddamn...  Who is this guy?  I like the fact that he applauded the Rihanna joke, though. 
[02:25:30]  That was cool of him.  What was that?  I didn't see that moment.  There was like a Chris Brown joke about Django being so brutal that it's like a date movie.  Yeah, yeah.  That was yours?  That was not mine, but it's a great joke.  But like, it got like a big like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Fucking babies.  And fucking, you know, Robert Downey Jr. was the only one loudly applauding him, which  is cool.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that was nice of him.  I love Robert Downey Jr.  He's fucking an amazing actor, and he's just done everything to fuck up.  You can't not like this guy.  And a huge comeback, yeah.  You should have mentioned how great his ass was in fucking Less Than Zero. 
[02:26:00]  Like, you know, when you were Julian, your fucking cheeks were amazing.  What a horrendous scene, though.  I know.  Oh, God.  I had a bunch of jokes that like were too much that you couldn't.  But like, Kavonzane, for example.  You know, she was.  Who?  Kavonzane Wallace, that nine-year-old.  Yeah.  Oh, Kavonzane.  Which Kavonzane?  Who?  No.  You know, she's nine, but she was six when they made that movie.  So that means she spent a third of her life involved with this movie.  Like, coincidentally, Robert Downey Jr. spent a third of his life in a whiskey bottle. 
[02:26:30]  Like, stuff like that.  But they were like, oh, that's funny.  Yeah, I thought it was funny, man.  Yeah.  You should have just, oh, did you write the onion joke for Seth and they took it?  No, I did not.  But that is goddamn ridiculous, though.  Especially because all of those, like, you know, false, infuriated people who just are rushing to her defense.  Now, as a result, Kavonzane's mom has to explain what a cunt is to a nine-year-old.  You know what I mean?  Like, if they hadn't made such a big deal out of that joke, then it wouldn't have gotten back to the little girl. 
[02:27:00]  But now, for sure, it has, you know?  Yeah.  So a mother has to say, look, it's just what your father calls me when he's been drinking.  I never understand that shit because you end up making it so much worse by bringing it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.  No, I would have never known.  I don't read the onion on a regular basis.  No, I don't follow him on Twitter.  Yeah, but, you know, the rest of the news had to go with it and say, listen to this, this is so fucking outrageous.  Right.  But meanwhile, they never have to say they're sorry or explain that. 
[02:27:30]  Of course not.  How come the fucking, why doesn't Fox or MSNBC cover the New York Post?  Look at this repulsive headline about a guy who was going to murder his wife in Cooker.  They're using puns.  Yeah.  Where's the fucking press covering that?  Yeah.  The onion says something and these fucking cocksuckers are all over it.  They're shit.  Yeah, but the actual press, you look in the Daily News or the Post and they're making jokes about this.  Meet the wife.  Meet the wife.  M-E-A-T the wife.  Yeah, really.  The cop who was going to murder his wife in Cooker.  Leave it to Cleaver.  It's a fucking fun little pun. 
[02:28:00]  They're coming up with headlines every day that are kind of funny.  Where's the outrage?  You don't see it.  No.  Whatever, I'm babbling.  You made your point, Jim.  Hey, tell me there's one that's been sexual bloodbath.  Like, I'm sure that that's, you know, she just...  Well, today's headline is Just Kidding.  Picture my wife like a goat.  And then Just Kidding.  Just Kidding.  Oh, Kid.  Kid.  They have a picture of a baby.  And a goat.  And a goat, so.  I got it.  It's called the Kid.  Well, they also have the Pope on the cover, so maybe Just Kidding has something to do with it.  Oh, that's a Just Kidding.  Maybe it's a boy fucking reference or some guy. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, there's a dash between the T's or the D's.  Oh, me, cocksucker.  I called a hyphen, a dash, and I said the wrong letter.  That's all right.  It works.  I stink.  It works.  Fuck it.  Boo.  Jim.  That's pretty good gig, though, right there at the Oscars.  Jesus Christ.  It was cool.  We were backstage, and we had to watch the pre-thing, whatever the nonsense where they come with it.  Red carpet?  Yeah, yeah, that day.  And one of the writers, when they were interviewing Kavans today, it was like... 
[02:29:00]  Because they just had such douchey questions.  You know, one of the writers was like, where's your dad?  Like, it was just such a great...  Oh, that'd be a good one.  Because obviously, she's there with her mom and her grandma and her...  Yeah.  You know, like, it's like, how come there's no guys in this family?  Where's your daddy?  What was the answer?  Is her father dead?  Please.  No, it was just a joke, because they're black people.  It was just a joke.  They're New Orleans black people.  Wow, Jimmy.  Oh, New Orleans.  I thought she was from overseas.  No, no.  Okay.  I did love that, though.  The fact that she...  This is her first movie ever. 
[02:29:30]  She's just like a kid from New Orleans who did the audition.  And then, you know, the dad in that movie was the guy who ran a bakery that they would  hang out in.  That was also his...  He's never been in a movie before.  Really?  That guy.  He's literally a baker.  And the production would, like, meet in his bakery.  And when they were trying to cast it, they're like, well, fuck, what about this guy?  Yeah.  Wow.  And they helmed, the two of them, single-handedly, like, helmed the Best Picture nominee.  You know?  That's fucked up.  And just, if you're keeping record, the guys from Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle went 
[02:30:00]  to Juilliard and Columbia and Harvard and fucking...  You know what I mean?  Like, studied, you know, Sanford-Meisner technique.  And their shit was not...  You know what I mean?  Like, it's just all such a bullshit thing that a guy who runs a bakery can do the exact  same thing.  Yeah.  So, now I want to move on to the governor's ball.  So, you got to go to the big...  Oh, that's the big one.  That's the big fucking party.  Who was at that one?  Literally everybody.  Like, you know, I just...  It's weird, because you just feel like...  That's so fucking...  You feel like you're flipping channels. 
[02:30:30]  You know what I mean?  You're like, oh, there's James Gandolfini.  And then you're like, oh, no, he's actually right there.  Like, it's a weird...  Yeah, so...  You can't wrap your head around it, right?  Yeah, and then you're just sitting at a table.  Like, you know, you just grab a snack or you're sitting there.  And then, like, the guy who wins Best Documentary just comes over and just dumps his giant  Oscar next to you at the table and just sits down and whatever, you know, starts  talking to you.  So, there's that.  It's bizarre.  But I only stuck around there for a little bit, because Seth's party was where we all  went and hung out, which was, like, way cooler.  That's probably a big one, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It was great.  What made his cooler?  Not his stuffy? 
[02:31:00]  Well, because it's like if you gave a nine-year-old a billion dollars, what he would do with a  party, you know?  There was, like, a 50-piece orchestra playing Star Wars music the whole time.  It was amazing.  There's, like, giant...  That's great.  ...Darth Vader ice sculptures everywhere, you know?  And it was all...  He's Richie Rich.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and, like, just an enormous pile of lobster claws, like...  Just piles.  Just piles of it.  No organization to it, really, right?  Yeah, yeah, just a giant pile of it, and, like, somebody has, like, laser precision cut  it so you don't have to crack it open, you know, and whatever. 
[02:31:30]  And so it was a very, like...  It was great, because it was a very non-Jew-friendly buffet.  Like, it was all seafood-y stuff, you know?  And how was he?  Was he relieved and happy at his party?  Yeah, well, yeah, he was...  You only kind of...  He made a brief appearance in his own thing, you know?  And he sang a song or whatever with the orchestra, and then, you know...  So I got to talk to him for a few minutes, but that was about it.  But then...  And then, it's just, like, he just emptied the modeling agencies in L.A.  Like, that must have been...  Oh, really?  It was just all strippers.  Like, just amazing, smoking hot, ridiculous, like, tight dress-wearing whores. 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  Like, if you were casting a movie with, like, one of those typical L.A. party movies, and  you're watching it, like, nobody actually...  There's not this...  But they were all there.  It was exactly that.  Like, it was pretty crazy.  So they hired girls to be there?  I don't know if they hired him, or they just gave out invitations to him, you know what  I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they probably want to show up, you know?  Yeah, it was rotten bitches.  Look, some fucking rich Hollywood guy.  It would have been funny that he showed up.  It was just a bunch of people in the kitchen, quietly having cheese, like hors d'oeuvres. 
[02:32:30]  Real uncomfortable.  You know, a bunch of, like, you-whoos out.  No, we're playing Pictionary.  Girls, Jimmy's going to have a lot of models at your gig this weekend at Poker Nuts.  Yeah, Poker Nuts.  He's going to have the models there as well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a big draw there.  They all like to sit under the antler head, watch me perform.  Antler head.  Object failure.  No.  Come on.  Come on, Jimmy.  How are your blueberries today?  Are they good, or mushy, or sour? 
[02:33:00]  They're good.  Oh, good.  Jesse, so I got one question.  So, what brought you back down to earth after the Oscars?  The one thing where you're like, huh?  Oh, really?  Do they even understand I wrote for the Oscars, and now you're-  Yeah, well, I have this, I got, like, this amazing parking spot, like, right in the Dolby  Theater.  Like, there's 30, 40 people that had parking spots, and I was one of them.  Giant sign that says, reserved for Jesse Joyce Academy Awards, right? 
[02:33:30]  This big, which I stole, by the way.  Nice, it should have.  Yeah, yeah.  But the car I drove was a 92 Hyundai Elantra, and it's from this place called Rent-A-Rack  in L.A.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fucking amazing.  Like, I look like a weed-dealing pizza delivery guy showing up at the Oscars, you know?  It's just all smashed in, and the front headlights burnt out.  Why didn't you go to Rent-A-Rack?  I know they're cheaper, but it's like renting a car for-  Because I was there for three months.  Oh, three months.  All right.  Total cost, $1,000 for a rental car. 
[02:34:00]  It's beautiful.  It's great.  So, like, as long as you're confident enough in the fact that you don't care if you're  driving a shitbox.  And you can beat the shit out of it, no matter.  You had a right for three months for this?  Well, no, because I was working on season two of The Burn with Jeff Ross, that show,  you know, Jimmy did last season.  So, yeah.  So, yeah, I did one and two, and then the Oscars right after that.  So, I was stuck out there for a while.  So, yeah, so I just hop in my shitbox, you know, immediately after the Oscars.  Like, that was kind of an interesting-  I have to pull up to Seth's party in this fucking, like, and it just-  You know, it's like making a- 
[02:34:30]  You know, like, Lamborghini.  Everybody else, it's like a line of Lamborghinis.  And then-  You're a piece of shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Where'd you stay?  I rented, like, a little studio apartment in Silver Lake, which is the worst place on  Earth.  It's like the belly of the beast, you know?  It's like the LA part of LA.  It's kind of like Williamsburg, but sunny air, you know?  It's just awful bearded shitheads hanging around, you know?  Right, right.  And, like, everybody's in stupid show business, which is what I hate about there, you know,  is that you can't avoid it, you know?  Like, every coffee shop, every time you go to make any kind of transaction, you just 
[02:35:00]  know that the person has a headshot and they're going to fail, you know what I mean?  Like, you just know they're a fucking failing actor, you know?  It's just sad.  Like, you can walk around New York all day long and never run into anybody else in show  business.  It's like, I think it keeps you around.  You can do that in this room.  We laugh because it's true.  That's hurtful, Jimmy.  It really is. 
[02:35:30]  Damn.  Well, that's fucking cool.  There you go.  The Pope is leaving.  Big headline.  Oh, is that it?  It's just about done.  And then they're flying up to the-  8 p.m.  Ah, good for him.  The papal retreat he's going to, whatever that is.  Fuck him.  I guess that's part of the whole Vatican thing, right?  So we're popeless at the moment, right?  Yeah.  Has he resigned yet?  Or is that happening?  Yeah, this is his last day.  Today's it.  Oh, okay.  But so when he actually, like, hands over the-  We don't know what happens.  We're running sons.  The keys or whatever the fuck.  We're trying to figure out if they have, like, a Joe Biden VP type of guy that goes in 
[02:36:00]  there for a little while.  Vice Pope.  Right.  Vice Pope.  Yeah.  Vice Pope.  That's, uh, yeah.  But you know what?  No one cares or will notice that we don't have a Pope.  You're right.  Until we get another Pope.  Like, who cares?  When does that start?  Immediately?  It's archaic.  They start making their way to the Vatican now?  All those cardinals?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently.  And then they do the smoke thing.  Yeah.  Then they, uh, no, they, they, I think they have a bunch of meetings.  Before they even do the smoke thing?  Yeah, before they even go for the smoke.  Hmm. 
[02:36:30]  Um, yeah, they, they meet, they do things, they go out with each other, do, do fucking  dinners.  Suck each other's cocks.  Which I'm sure.  I don't think that.  Yeah.  I'm sure those meetings.  Oh, well, I don't think that.  I'm sure those meetings don't go well.  You know what I mean?  It's like a guy from, you know, Ghana.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're like, what the fuck do they have to talk about?  You know what I mean?  What are they going to talk about?  Yeah.  I used to date this girl who, uh, this sounds bullshit, but it's not.  I dated Vladimir Putin's translator briefly.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, yeah, yeah.  Pretty cool.  I met her at McSorley's, that shitty bar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I met her, because she, she was his guy, or, uh, he had like five simultaneous translators, 
[02:37:00]  and one of them, she was the one who would do stuff at the UN when he was here, right?  So she'd fly in and do that, and then she just went to McSorley's, so I met her there.  So I met her that night, and then technically speaking, I fucked her in Russia, because she  took me back to the UN Plaza One.  Oh, okay.  So I had a one-night stand.  I've never been to Russia, but I had a one-night stand there.  Wow.  She was hot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's pretty great.  And, uh, uh, and then, you know, whatever.  We dated off and off for a little, just every time she was in town. 
[02:37:30]  But the point is, is that she is, uh, simultaneous translation is what she does professionally  for a living.  Wow.  The best case scenario that you can imagine to get, like, the top of their game, simultaneous  translators, 75% accuracy.  Wow.  That's the best you can possibly hope for.  Isn't that shocking and terrifying?  Yes.  What does simultaneous translator mean?  That's when we're negotiating something, you and I, and, but you don't speak English,  so as a result, you have your guy, and I have my guy, and they translate what is being 
[02:38:00]  said at the time.  As you're talking.  You know what I'm saying?  Instead of, like, translating later on.  Translating a speech.  Yeah, yeah.  It's translating actual negotiations.  So 75% is the best you can have.  Those earpiece things.  Yeah, yeah, that's what that is.  And it's just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So what languages did she speak?  Like, the five.  Greek and French?  Yeah.  No, they speak, like, five at the UN or something.  So it's like English, French, Russian, Chinese, and whatever the fifth one is. 
[02:38:30]  I don't remember.  It's a smart broad.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to speak that many languages.  Yeah.  And fluently and understand them and translate them quickly to fucking Vladimir Putin.  But can you imagine, like, if 25% of what we were talking about was lost?  Like, how fucking nonsensical it would be.  Oh, boy.  That happens every day.  Except they're talking about nuclear weapons.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's very important stuff.  If you want to read our Twitters, it happens every day.  They only catch about 60% of what we're saying.  Right.  Accurately.  And you can only do it for two hours a day, apparently, because it's so taxing on your 
[02:39:00]  brain, or three hours or something.  Really?  Yeah.  So that's her whole shift is, like, three, and she's done.  She, uh, rest her head.  Wow, man.  Because apparently, because you have to be listening in one language and immediately just  push it back out in a different one, you know?  So it's a really complicated thing to do.  Amazing.  That can even be done.  Pretty amazing.  Yeah.  And you know they get it wrong once.  Oh, yeah.  I was talking about it at a time.  Yeah.  Well, no.  She actually, while we were kind of seeing each other, she, uh, caused an international  incident.  Oh.  Why?  Which was the hottest thing ever to me.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Apparently, it happens constantly.  Like, they'll point, like, apparently what happened was, they were talking with the Chinese 
[02:39:30]  about how many nukes are on the Russian-Chinese border, or whatever, and she, uh, mistranslated  the number.  Oh, see, that's a big one right there.  She was off by, like, 20,000 or something like that.  That's big.  And, uh, the Chinese, like, literally just took off their, got up and walked away.  Like, they walked out of the meeting.  Oh, man.  So there was a thing in the New York Times, it was, like, the Chinese left the table at  a nuclear disarmament discussion, and it caused a big, and then, like, it happens all  the time.  I bet you if you look at, like, you know, buried eight pages deep the next day, it's 
[02:40:00]  like, it was a mistranslation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, that'll always happen, so.  But you're just fucking looking, going, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You fucking troublemaker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm a fucking trick.  It's pretty great, right?  Fucking fuck you, you troublemaker.  He's got great stories.  Why'd you stop seeing her?  Because I started, because I felt it.  That long distance relationship.  No, because I'm an idiot, because I fell in love with a fucking cocktail waitress in  Kentucky.  All right.  That's why.  So she came from Russia to see me, and I bailed on her.  Oh, man.  Really?  Yeah, I feel bad about that.  Well, oh, she flew in, and you were already seeing somebody else?  Well, I wanted to, it was like I'd started dating the other broads, so I didn't want 
[02:40:30]  to, like, hurt either of their feelings.  Yikes.  So then I, when she got here, I had to go.  You're a good guy.  Oh, you're that guy.  When she got here, I had to go, like, sorry, we can't hang out.  So then she fucked my roommate.  That's what happened.  Wow.  Oh.  Yeah.  So wait, so you, why'd you let her fly in instead of just calling her?  Because I'm a fucking coward.  That's why.  You let her fly all the way from Russia?  I didn't know how to tell her.  It's not like she's coming in from Cleveland.  Yeah, from Jersey or something.  I didn't know how to tell her.  Oh, man, I had to go through the tunnel.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who's the better bang? 
[02:41:00]  The Kentucky waitress.  Okay, you made the right move.  Yeah.  Who had a meteor pussy?  Meteor.  Probably the Russian, actually.  Oh, boo, Jesse.  Well, you and I, I think, have different.  Probably.  Probably.  As far as that.  The Jimmy Norton meaty pussy thing is beyond me.  Literally.  I don't get it.  If you said the Russian girl had a meaty pussy, but she lost her head in a fucking hedge  clipping accident, I'd still take her.  Plus, you banged her a bunch of times.  You were probably done with it. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Not for anyone.  You know what I thought was exciting, though, is that somewhere in a basement filing cabinet  in the Kremlin, there has to be a dossier about me.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  You don't think so, yeah.  Because I was two people away from the Russian president.  You're too close.  You know what I mean?  Too close.  Oh, God.  Like, at some point, they had to watch my live at Gotham.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Like, a couple of ex-KGB dudes was like, yo.  Who is this Jesse Joyce?  Well, they need to sign me in and stuff.  Find out who this is.  What does he do?  I don't know.  He gives serious talk.  He gives very boring lectures.  Some sort of motivational speaking. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  He does motivational speaking about cocaine, apparently.  I don't know.  Yes, he stopped talking, and the people just look.  They look at him very strange.  Oh, man.  So, yeah, they had to sign you into the Russian consulate, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then I went to Geneva once to hang with her.  Because she had a lot of money, so she flew me over to hang at the UN in Geneva.  What a piece of shit.  He makes her fly.  Did she fly your business class?  No, she didn't.  But it's fine.  Coach.  Yeah.  Good for you.  For a Kentucky cocktail waitress. 
[02:42:30]  How did that work out?  It was interesting.  I set up a show in Geneva, so I did stand up there.  No, I mean, how did it work out with the Kentucky broad?  Oh, I dated her for a couple years, so it actually did work out.  All right, so it was a real thing.  Yeah, yeah.  So you went to Geneva, Coach, and you set up a gig?  Yeah.  And so I went to the UN in Geneva.  She signed me in there, too.  And I went to the cafeteria and had lunch with her colleagues.  Oh, colleagues.  Yeah, and I've never been less interesting in my entire... 
[02:43:00]  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Because they're all literally working on Rwandan genocide prosecutions.  You know?  They're these lawyers who are prosecuting dictators.  And then it's like, this guy wrote a fucking joke about Seth MacFarlane's cock that went pretty  well in Minot, North Dakota.  That's what I'm doing.  Wow, that's fucking amazing to me that you ditched the Russian chick.  What did you think of Russia?  I never went to Russia.  Oh, Geneva, you said.  Yeah, yeah, I went to Geneva.  I assumed you went to Russia once or twice.  It's very... 
[02:43:30]  You know what it's like?  Because I've also been...  And this sounds...  I sound like a fucking douchey world traveler.  No, this is very worldly.  The only other place I went that was like it is Singapore.  And they're so broken by the rules there.  Yeah.  Because it's such a rule-oriented city.  Oh, yeah.  They will fuck you up if you break the rules.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's like there's...  It's the cleanest place you've ever been.  You know, like in Singapore, like you can't spit...  You can't chew gum.  They can you, yeah.  You can't spit on the ground.  No, they don't have gum.  It's a non-existent thing.  I would hate that. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, like they'll have like whatever, juicy fruit, but it's mints.  You know what I mean?  Like they've come up with a way to be able to still sell shit in Singapore.  And so they make like little whatever.  But the point is...  I want to make that gum money.  But it's the only two places I've ever been where like it's two in the morning and you're  trying to cross the street and it's a completely empty street.  No one is there.  And so you just start going, right?  Because it's a wide open...  Because, you know, you're in New York.  That's what you do.  And there's a person waiting at the crosswalk across the way who's like, what are you?  Go back! 
[02:44:30]  You know, like because they're waiting for the little sign to tell them that it's okay.  Wow.  But it's two in the morning.  There's nobody here, right?  And they're waiting at the crosswalk and you just go running across the street and they  like are looking for a cop.  Like a crazy person.  You're going to get in trouble.  You're a bank robber at that point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're crazy.  Remember that kid that got caned over there?  Yeah.  I am not joking about this.  He played against my baseball team.  Really?  Michael Fay, that cocksucker.  You're like Zelig.  He's like a pitcher.  He really is. 
[02:45:00]  Who's Zelig?  The guy that's like kind of in the background.  Woody Allen movie.  He's in the background of everywhere with his nose everyone.  It was before Gump.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of like a Farris Gump thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Well, sure then.  He did.  He played.  Yeah, he was in Dayton, Ohio.  I lived there for a while.  Before or after his caning?  Dayton, Ohio.  Who else comes from Dayton, Ohio?  It was a ball player, I think, right?  Yeah.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  Oh, right.  With two very bad knees.  Who's this?  I don't know.  Why'd he leave? 
[02:45:30]  In a dream to become a major league baseball player.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  It's Lou Gehrig.  I think God the dream came true.  Mike Schmidt.  It's Mike Schmidt.  Retiring.  Poor Mike Schmidt.  Some 18 years ago.  Some 18 years ago.  I left Dayton, Ohio.  It's not a complete show without playing that one.  No.  I love that clip.  Every fucking day.  So you're from Dayton. 
[02:46:00]  No, I'm from Pittsburgh, but my dad worked for a couple years in Dayton, so we went there.  And that was in my little league days.  And stupid Michael Fay was also a little eager in Dayton.  Did you think that one day he'd get caned in Singapore?  Yes.  Everybody did.  Everyone knew.  Because he was such a piece of shit.  He was a cunt, huh?  Yeah.  Well, obviously.  He also went to a fucking foreign country with his dad and spray painted a parking lot full of cars.  That's what he did.  Like, yes, you should get your ass beat. 
[02:46:30]  So what did he spray?  Just sprayed the windows?  No, he just graffitied the shit out of an entire parking lot full of cars.  In Singapore.  Yeah, in Singapore.  That's ballsy.  Why would Clinton have stepped in for him?  It was Bush.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It was the first Bush.  And what happened?  Did they listen to him?  Well, no.  They negotiated.  They were going to give him, like, 50 canes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Bush was able to negotiate it down to, like, five or ten or something.  I don't remember what it was.  I bet you they made those ten hurt, though.  Oh, I bet you.  I bet you they fucking made...  Trust me.  I followed that story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he was such an asshole.  Because you got to think they were pissed they had to fucking negotiate down. 
[02:47:00]  So, like, all right, we get ten.  We're going to make it fucking count.  Yeah, yeah.  So, they give you smelling salts after every one because you pass out.  And they need you to be awake for it.  And they need you awake because if they're whipping you and you're asleep.  They give you smelling salts.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, you will obviously pass out.  And they showed what happens on the news with, like, a turkey.  Like, a raw turkey.  Oh.  When it splits it completely wide open.  Show that on the...  Sam, can you find that?  It splits your ass open, for sure.  And so, you pass out every time. 
[02:47:30]  So, then they wake you back up.  So, 50 would be...  See, look at that.  Let me see.  That's real?  Oh, my God.  Is that a real...  On the ass?  Come on.  How fucking...  How, like, sexual that is.  Yeah, there's, like, meaty chunks of his ass taken out.  Oh!  Yeah.  Who's that?  Is that him?  I don't know if that's him or not.  That's, like, permanent damage.  Is that real?  I don't think it is.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  How many shots is that?  It almost doesn't look real.  I don't know.  That looks pretty...  Now, when they give you 50, do they give you 50 in a row or do they do it over a couple  days?  I can't speak to it.  I'm not positive that it was 50, but it was, like, whatever the number was, it was a lot 
[02:48:00]  more, and they negotiated it way down.  That is a brutal fucking...  Can you imagine getting fucked in the ass right after that?  How great that would feel compared to it?  God, damn.  How do you even take a dump in for that?  Or they make you sit down in a pile of salt.  Oh, God.  Oh, that would hurt.  So they give you smelling...  So what, do they bend you over, like, a sawhorse or something, or a fucking...  Yeah, there's, like, a...  They have a device that they put you in.  Like, it's specifically for getting your ass beat with a cane. 
[02:48:30]  And the cane has, like, holes drilled in it, so it, like, whistles, you know what I mean?  So it even...  No wind resistance.  Yeah, you could really...  Oh, look at that thing.  And the device, yeah, see, it's intended so there's no give.  So your ass is right up against it, so there's nowhere...  Oh, right, so you can't, like, absorb some of the...  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  ...the shock.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, that guy...  There's a picture of a guy bent over, and there's another guy really giving him a caning.  Wow.  I think we need this in this country.  I do, too.  That looks like the big unit...  Make a few people behave.  It's, like, in a pitch.  Yeah.  That's, like, fucking... 
[02:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wound up.  Yeah, for sure.  They hit you hard?  Do they protect your balls, though, so your balls don't get hit?  I suspect that was part of that device, yeah, so...  Cover your bag?  Jesus Christ, that's fucked up.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I'm glad he was an asshole.  Yeah.  Nah, I don't want to.  So is he back now or no?  Who?  That kid.  I don't have any fucking relationship with him.  I just know he was an asshole from...  You should have wrote him.  He was, like, one of the shithead kids in town.  Was he a rich kid?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because his dad was, like, a diplomat or something, you know?  Oh, so he's a little cunt. 
[02:49:30]  So, yeah, yeah.  Just on his Twitter and just go, ha-ha.  I knew that would happen to you.  I wonder how he got busted.  Like, what are the...  But he had, like, a reputation in town, too, for being, like, the shithead.  Like, the biff of...  You know what he did?  So he was, like, you know?  Biff Tannen.  Yeah, he's, like, Biff Tannen.  But anyway...  That was great.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  But so both plays...  You're just, like, that's the consequences for, you know, jaywalking.  So as a result, everybody's, like, don't...  Wait, they don't care for jaywalking, do they?  No, but they're...  I mean, they're serious. 
[02:50:00]  They don't fuck around.  Where do they start with the caning?  What crime, you think?  Can we look that up?  I'm gonna guess theft of some sort, or vandalism, or...  I bet you it's a lot less than that.  I bet you'll be very surprised where you'll probably get one good shot.  Some weird thing, snickering in front of the Kaiser.  Sam has some videos of caning.  It can be ordered for over 30 offenses, including hostage-taking, robbery, gang robbery with murder,  drug use, vandalism, and rioting.  Vandalism.  All right, so, you know, vandalism. 
[02:50:30]  We ought to enact this in Chicago.  Nice.  Oh, here's a video of some caning.  Let me see.  Oh, dear.  Oh, jeez.  He said, oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  We got some volume.  I want to hear this.  All right, there's some...  And this is Singapore?  Yeah.  There's some poor bastards.  There's a military-looking guy signing you in.  That's what their whole language sounds like, by the way.  Bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.  Bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.  Guy's got that mustache, like... 
[02:51:00]  He's like, I'm the caning guy.  I'll be checking you in.  He looks like Mako from MASH.  A little shitty, spanking mustache.  I played every Asian during the 70s.  Yeah.  Remember that guy from Tora, Tora, Tora?  I remember that guy.  Oh, man.  He's got nice cheeks.  Now, he's being bent forward on it.  The front is tied.  Everyone's got masks on, I guess, in case a little wind comes out.  A little nervous wind.  They're fastening his legs and his arms onto this device.  Now, are you allowed to block with your hands? 
[02:51:30]  Of course.  He has very, very solid cheeks, though.  He's clenching them already.  They're strapping his body against this thing right above the waist.  I bet that's a doctor.  I bet that's the guy who's there to make sure.  And now where's the official cane?  Yeah.  Is that a paddle?  Oh, he's...  I don't know.  Oh, caning does not look good.  Oh, no.  When there's 10 guys in fucking surgical masks tying you...  This is brutal.  This has got to just suck.  All right.  He's strapped way in.  Now, only his ass is sticking out.  Everybody else is protected.  That way your legs don't get hit.  Right. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  Oh, there's a sadist.  How fucking pseudo-sexual is this?  I don't think it is at all.  I think it's brutal.  Like, why the ass?  Yeah.  Let's see.  Oh, man.  They're all looking.  Oh, you don't want to hear that.  You never want to hear that.  You never want to hear that.  Never.  Oh.  One.  Oh, fuck.  And there's a guy with the smelling salts, right?  Yes.  Oh.  Go up.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:52:30]  It's starting to bleed a little.  Bleed a little.  Bleed.  Oh, my God.  After two shots.  Here.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  The third one now is cut.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell me I'm not the only one with a hard cock.  Oh.  Cut it.  Now he just sucked in his butt a little bit.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because it's going over the same spot.  It's bleeding.  Here.  Oh.  Oh, that went right over the same spot. 
[02:53:00]  That was five.  Oh, he's hurting.  He's hurting now.  Dude, one would be good enough for me.  This is unpleasant.  No.  Six.  Oh.  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  This looks so painful.  He's tightening his butt.  Why would you ever do anything wrong?  Yeah, yeah.  Seven.  Oh, that one was low on the butt.  Oh, my goodness.  His ass is, like, ripped.  Chafed.  Is this against our No More Gay?  No. 
[02:53:30]  This isn't gay.  All right.  No more.  Oh.  Oh, he's moving around a lot.  Yeah.  He's wiggling.  They're cinching him in now tighter.  His ass is wiggling.  I bet you that was the pause between whatever, six and seven, was them giving him smelling salts.  Oh, wake him back up.  That happened.  You really passed out, huh?  They are cinching him in tighter because he started moving.  Can you handle that?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Of course not.  Jim's paid for it.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  His ass is in time. 
[02:54:00]  They're going for new areas.  These are brutal spanks.  That was a lower cheek.  His ass is ripped up, man.  That is brutal.  Oh, that's it?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That was eight?  Thank you, sir.  Oh, no.  It's not.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's got to be good.  Oh, no.  What did he do?  Yo, what did this guy do?  Don't do it again.  I don't want to do that.  That's eight, I think. 
[02:54:30]  That was ten.  That's ten right there.  Oh, is he saying, like...  No more.  No more.  Wow.  God bless.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, that guy's hurting.  Now he's just begging.  He's saying, like...  Yeah.  What if he's saying, fuck you, give me another?  Yeah.  I've learned my lesson.  Put some fucking muscle into it.  Oh, my God.  What the hell is he saying?  His ass is ripped up.  He's not going to be able to fucking sit. 
[02:55:00]  How many?  Oh, that tears you the fuck up, man.  The divots in his ass look like baked potatoes almost.  That shape?  Yes.  God, they're still going.  Oh, that was a big one.  Yeah, yeah.  You think he's got a rod?  I don't know how much...  Oh, man.  There's way too much time left in this video.  There's still two more minutes.  Oh.  That one wasn't very hard.  I think he's slacking off.  Yeah.  Does it count if they fuck up?  Probably.  Oh, you can see him trying to clench. 
[02:55:30]  Tighten up his butt cheeks.  Just that anticipation of waiting for it.  Oh.  I don't...  And how do you clean this shit?  What a rotten shower he must have after.  Oh, that's got to sting, man.  You ever have soap going over a cut?  There's, like, birds tweeting in the background, all nice and pleasant.  Oh, my God.  I think they better give him some much smelling salts.  He's got to wake up.  He's not screaming.  He's not screaming.  God. 
[02:56:00]  Too much spit.  What about the...  Is that it?  That might be it.  Now, what do they put on his hiney to make it all better?  Oh, look.  They're patting him.  Like, they're there.  They give you a little love afterwards.  Oh, that's good.  It's like when Kiss pushed you down the stairs, Jimmy, and then stroked your head and kissed you.  It's just bleeding.  It's dripping blood from his ass cheeks.  Well, I bet you behaved for a year after that shit.  Oh, yeah.  How do you sit?  Jesus. 
[02:56:30]  They just destroyed his ass.  Yeah.  What was that, like, 15 lashes?  Well, you're certainly not going to steal a car, because you'd have to sit in the car seat.  Yeah, that's true.  That's not going to happen anymore.  God.  You just can't sit down.  He's kind of walking.  Walking a little bow-legged.  Oh, yeah.  He's doing better than I'd be doing.  He's doing all right, though.  Wow.  Imagine then they go, like, oh, wait a minute.  I wasn't counting.  Oh, we forgot one.  Get back.  Bring him back in.  No.  Got to make it official.  Firing squads will have, like, one guy with a fake bullet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Blank in there.  That guy is just the guy who beats your ass. 
[02:57:00]  You know what I mean?  He's the guy.  There's no other guy with a fake stick.  So you don't know.  How was I woke today, honey?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  I beat the ass.  What's a bad day at work, though, when a piece of ass skin flies up and gets stuck in your  lashes?  That's what it is.  Like, when you're eating in the cafeteria later and you're fucking coughing and a piece  of ass skin falls off your cheek, you're like, oh, nerds.  Oh, nerds.  Wow, that was fucking horrendous.  That was fucking horrendous.  And we watched the whole thing. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, we did.  But you know what?  You're not wrong.  That would be a great punishment here for shit like fucking gang violence and other  stuff like that.  People would behave.  You just put that video out saying this is what we're now doing in America?  Yeah.  You've got to think some people would fucking behave.  What is this?  We have a picture of the cane itself.  Like, I want to see if it's what it looks.  This guy's, by the way.  Do you go to caning school?  I bet.  Yeah, I wonder.  Right?  You join the police force, whatever.  You know, like, this guy has specific...  Yeah, I kind of like his right arm and how it moves.  I think we should move him into caning school. 
[02:58:00]  Get that Tommy John surgery.  Nice.  Look at that.  Can't really swing.  I don't know.  I think that's like a chaplain cane.  That's like a fucking...  What is that?  It's like a whip.  I don't think that's...  Bamboo.  Oh, maybe.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, there they are, right?  Isn't that them?  Oh.  No, it's not them.  Whatever.  God damn it, it's brutal.  Oh, Sam, you can't find Singapore fucking...  Can I tell you, though?  There's people that like S&M that they couldn't take that much.  No.  But there are guys that can take black and blueing.  And when you look at bondage stuff, there are people that want to get whipped so bad that 
[02:58:30]  they're bleeding.  Oh, we know.  You know who's a fucking crazy person when it comes to whipping ass is our own E-Rock,  if you remember.  When he wailed into...  What's her name?  Oh, Justine Jolie.  Justine Jolie and wailed on her ass.  She wasn't none too happy.  Left a handprint.  It was like a caning.  Brutal.  It was brutal.  E-Rock got way too...  What, E-Rock?  He just went over the top.  He got way too into it.  What'd you say?  I think I have a sample here if you want to hear it.  You want to hear it?  Listen to this.  Yeah, yeah.  She said... 
[02:59:00]  Ah!  Oh!  I fucked it up.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were going to play right away.  I just wanted to help with the setup.  She was all cool, like, yeah, you can spank me.  Right.  She bent over and E-Rock fucking...  Hold back.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking wailed her.  Ah!  Oh, shit.  Ow!  Oh, mother!  Fucker!  Mother!  Fuck you!  E-Rock!  You cocksucker!  Wow.  Are you shitting me?  She's fair-skinned, too.  You don't...  Oh, my God! 
[02:59:30]  Son of a bitch!  Do you know how to fucking spank a girl, you douchebag?  And I'm just selling him out.  It went from a fun little thing to...  What the fuck?  Oh, we got video of this?  This is the other girl he spanked.  Oh, and then E-Rock.  Yeah, we learned that E-Rock...  Oh, yes, E-Rock?  Real quick before...  He's a serial spanker.  Before you show this other one, Justine Jolie, once that was done, she had to go do a shoot  later that day.  Oh.  And the handprint was raised up off her ass, so they had to, like, work around the fact  that they couldn't show her ass. 
[03:00:00]  Watch this one.  And then another girl came in, and we said...  That E-Rock got...  Here we go.  Oh!  Yo!  What is wrong with you?  Wow.  You were at, like, a distance.  You got, like, a running start.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Steve used to love that twisted shit.  I completely underestimated him 
[03:00:30]  I have completely turned on your son  Yeah, really  The Supra got a better fucking random shot  Of Kennedy being murdered  Than we got five years ago  I didn't like that one  I didn't like those spankings  It was mean  Yeah, I didn't like that actually  E-Rock, wow  His hatred toward women really shows through  I was caught because I really do love Eric  And I like the fact that he hates women  I wonder if E-Rock has to 
[03:01:00]  Come up with a scenario  To really get it  Like she fucked up dinner or something  Oh yeah, yeah, something  He'd shoot her for that  He's a chubby boy  He likes his dinner  He loves a good din-din  That's what he's going to say on his tombstone  Here lies Eric, he loved a good din-din  With a hyphen  That would be a great tombstone  I gotta piss  Why, Jimmy?  What the hell is that about?  I have to  Yeah? 
[03:01:30]  Well, Jesse Joyce  This was terrific  You can certainly stay if you want  It's up to you  Yeah, whatever  But in case you decide a fucking bolt  I want to make sure people know  You're Jesse Joyce on Twitter  A funny fucking guy  Thanks, man  Jesse's great  Yeah, at Jesse Joyce  With the two S's  Make sure you spell that right  And then Anchorage  I don't think we have an audience in Anchorage  I think that's one place  We just might not have people  It's 1 of 50  1 of 50  We're not sure if we have an audience  In the Poconos, obviously  Oh, man  Well, I'm going to Columbia, Missouri  In two weeks  That's cool 
[03:02:00]  Deja vu in Columbia, Missouri  And what is this other Canadian gig?  Oh, Antigonish, Nova Scotia  Yeah  Oh, you're going to Nova Scotia, too  Yeah  Like back-to-back, actually  Like the two furthest possible places  You could be on the converse  Oh, right, yeah  You're hiding from somebody, huh?  Well, I just wanted to get the fuck out of L.A.  Like, that's literally  Why are you taking these weird gigs?  Because I wanted to, like  I have been stuck in the same place  For three straight months  Right  So I just wanted to get out  Weird meaning they're far away lads  Right  No, they are  Have you been to Nova Scotia? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, my parents have a place up there  Are you Canadian?  No  No, but  That was the way you should react to that question  But I like that  No, fuck  Visceral nausea  Stop it  I've heard nothing but good things about Nova Scotia  People love it up there  It is cool  It's like cheap Maine, you know  That's the nice thing about it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's pretty great  It's probably more pristine and all that  Yeah, it's nice  I want their ones  Very nice  Nautical  Very nautical  It really is, yeah, yeah  Vikings  Yeah, yeah  They have Viking shit up there?  Fishing Viking thing  You don't need to go to Cadillac  If I want to fish  I go to the lake  What the hell do I know? 
[03:03:00]  Fucking regular Joe  I hate regular Joe  I like the posture, though  Like he's all  Oh, yeah  He's right on the job site  Yeah, exactly  Yeah  My container of coffee  That's all I need  Yeah, you write jokes  I'll eat a roll  What the hell do I know?  No, but their place is like  Literally right on the water  And like the lobster boats  Go straight by  And you can like  Yell to the guys  That you need a couple  And they'll like bring them  After like that day  Wow  And then you say  No, I meant a man and a woman 
[03:03:30]  Dominating sexually  A couple  I'm going to get  Fucked by a filthy semen  Oh, God  When you said you can yell to him  The first thing I thought of was  Hey, fag on the boat  What the fuck?  There'd be no reason to yell that  I know  I know  And I'm like so nice there  I know  They'd be like  Oh, I wonder what his problem is  That was the first thing I thought of  Just screaming mean shit  At the guy on the boat  Is that the place where Newfie's? 
[03:04:00]  Well, that's Newfoundland  But it's right there  You know  Yeah, it's close though  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But they don't  They don't like each other, right?  Or something  I don't think the rest of Canada  Likes the Maritimes  Like that's all the eastern shit  Like I think that's the deal  I went there once  And I walked into  You went there?  I walked into a bar  I did  I went into a bar  And these people are like  They had these weird hats on  And they were singing songs  Right  It was like  Everyone's having this great time  But it's the weirdest  What?  I know he's probably going for a Klan meeting 
[03:04:30]  No, I was actually going to go for a temple joke  It was a bomb  It was weird hats  But then I just realized  It was a bomb waiting to happen  And it would have interrupted you  So I bet  Wait, now I've got to ask you  What the fuck were you doing up there?  How long ago was that?  It's like an out of the way place  It was a couple years ago  I was visiting Ray Lynn  Oh, she's up that way  Yeah, yeah  She's one of them Canadians  No, I know that  But I didn't know if she was over in that direction  Yeah, yeah  It was pretty cool 
[03:05:00]  Yeah  Did you ever notice  When people in the Maritimes  When it's a weird tick of theirs  When they affirm a statement  Like when they agree with you  The way they say it  They inhale  They go, yeah  Like that  It's the fucking craziest  Like the first time you hear it  You're like, are you okay?  Like you think they're choking  Or they had a stroke or something  Like it's a really  So you just be telling a story  And while they're like  Acknowledging that they're paying attention to the story  They just sit there and go  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Like that  Like it's like hyperventilating  Because the first time they say that  Is probably when someone says 
[03:05:30]  Do you need me to pull you out of the water?  Because they're drowning  Dumb boat people  Fuck them  All right, Jesse, man  It's been too long  You going to be around in New York  After these weird gigs?  Yeah, I live here again  All right, so we'll have you on sooner than later  Sweet, yeah, cool  Jesse Joyce once again on Twitter  And Anchorage at the Chilkoot  Chilkoot Charlies  Chilkoot Charlies on March 5th through the 10th  We're going to take a break  I get pissed desperately  What about Poconuts?

[03:06:30]  Saturday night  Kevin Hart's hosting  Oh, cool  Yeah, happy for him  Yeah  Good stuff  Yeah, yeah  I have to go right into this, Sam  After the sweeper  Well, let's hear the sweeper  Sirius XM  This is the opinion of this show  Bam  Bam  Bam  Oh  Very good  Hi  Hi there  We're here with Jesse Joyce 
[03:07:00]  Hi  Hello  Hi Jesse  What's up, fella?  I don't know  Jesse's a very funny guy  Ah, that's sweet of you  Yeah  Very good comic  We were in Alaska  Yeah, yeah, yeah  He plays Alaska  For some reason  Well, we were just talking about  What a fucking terrified child I was  I know you were too, right?  Yeah, yeah  He's a terrified adult  But I would watch scary movies  Right  We're all very excited here  We just got the Blu-ray copy  Of all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies  Yeah  So we were talking about it 
[03:07:30]  And apparently you do not like scary movies  I don't, like  My fear as a child  Like when there's so many evolutions  Like I think Freddy Krueger was the first thing  And I never even saw the movie  It was just the box cover  You never saw the original Nightmare?  Dude, I like literally saw a picture on the box cover  And I didn't sleep for like a month  So like there's no way I could have seen the actual movie  Zero chance  And then I went through a phase where I was terrified  That my parents were going to get kidnapped  While I was sleeping  I don't know what the fuck I was about 
[03:08:00]  But I was like sure that  So I literally had this thing  Where like they would put me to bed  And then I would have to tell them  To make noise  Out in the living room  When they were up  So like  So that I knew that they were still there  You know what I mean?  That no one had swiped them  Oh, because you were afraid of being alone  Right, right, right  Yeah, so like every now and again  They just bang on something  So I could like follow  So I knew that like  Oh, they're still  And they would do that?  They would appease you by doing that?  Well, right, but then  My fucking irrationality  Gained a new level of sophistication  And I was like  Well, wait a minute  Whoever steals my parents  Would have the foresight  To just leave a tape recording device 
[03:08:30]  Of them making noise  In the living room  Oh, man  So I used to  Then that didn't  Once that thought creeped in my head  Then like there was nothing  I was like  They might still be gone  I don't know  They can't be safe  They could have been stolen hours ago  And I've been listening to this recording  So I'd have to like  Still get out of bed  Every like fucking hour and a half  And like go out  What a little weirdo  I know  Isn't that sad?  What a cock block  I know  Your fucking dad's trying to get his hog sucked  When you pop in  Peering around the corner  I didn't hear any noise  Well, I don't think they do  A lot of the time  I just peer around the corner  Just like 
[03:09:00]  Alright, cool  They're still here  Can I go back to them?  So did you just need white noise of some sort?  I love that noise  I don't know  I just  Make it  I just really went through  White  Yes, you're right  Wow  I just went through a phase  Yeah, where I was like  Afraid that my parents  Were going to get stolen from  I don't know what the fuck that was about  Stolen?  Do you still not like horror movies?  No, I still don't watch them  Kenny won't watch them either  Like he really won't watch them  And I'm amazed at that  And he's a big galoot  Yeah, he is a lummox  It's just a discomfort  You know what I mean?  Like that's all 
[03:09:30]  I don't like when the fucking  You know, like there's weird music  I don't like getting jumpy  I don't like slasher movies  Not because I'm afraid of them or anything  I just don't find them really entertaining  Right  I like  I like a good scary movie  Like, you know, where fucking  Those weird chicks are just in positions  They're not supposed to be in  Crawling on the ceiling  So what about like shit  It just looks like  Yeah, where it's some little girl  Like all of a sudden  John hinges for no good reason  Yeah, yeah  Very creepy 
[03:10:00]  Mommy  Yeah, yeah  Fuck off  Yeah, little kids are always like  You can't be here  You know, that's scary shit to me  But I'll watch them  Yeah  You know  And then I'll like go  Go to go to bed  And it's dark in the room  And I'll maybe turn a light  Always  Yeah  What a faggot  Why would you want to  Subject yourself to that  I know  I don't know why  It's that fucking visceral feeling  That emotion  I'm writing a horror movie  Oh, are you?  About a guy with a knife  And he just runs around  Going, you're dead 
[03:10:30]  I feel like I've seen similar  Sounds horrible  Sounds horrible  Yeah  The you're dead killer  Yeah  And he just screams  You're dead  And he chases you  It's not a good movie  Well, there was something  That happened years ago  Of course  I was going to take a shower  Right after watching Psycho  Psycho was on TV 
[03:11:00]  And decided, you know  Take a shower  I don't know why  And my brother had sent my sister  Into the bathroom  Wearing a wig  And holding a knife  Right  And ripped the shower curtain open  And went  And then  Because she was like  I guess, I don't know  Maybe he's six years old  And she goes  Eee, eee, eee  And I collapsed  You were scared  Into the shower  Scared the shit out of me  What if she was a little  Six-year-old in a wig  A little girl  Yeah, but it was 
[03:11:30]  It didn't matter  Yeah  It could have been anything  It was just  That I was in the shower  And I was  I was petrified  Was this recently?  Yeah, last week  It was very, very frightening  Equally scary for the six-year-old  Yes  Right  I beat her with my penis  A little fucker  Get out of here  That's a good way to get punched in the face  Yes  You know, like scaring people  Is never like a good  Like I've seen that go badly  So many times  Yeah  Oh, Jimmy  Is that you?  What?  Holy shit  That's my coffee  It literally smells like dog shit in here 
[03:12:00]  Your coffee smells like dog shit?  Oh, God  No, that's you  That was terrible  He's acting  Wow  Oh, my God  Yeah, that  You should  Oh, my God  It's terrible  I dropped a stinker  Wow  Oh, come on  What are you doing?  You're gonna get us poisoned with the ozone layer  The worst thing is gone  Worse than any scary movie  Exactly  Jimmy's asshole  Just take it  Come on  Fucking have a laugh  Enjoy it  I've said plenty of times on this very program  How  Oh, don't wave it toward me 
[03:12:30]  Waving it away  Jimmy just did that  So the listeners know he's still here  Yeah  That's how I know I exist  Plenty of times on this very program  I've discussed how petrified, scared, I grew up  I was in a constant state of fear  Yeah  Of everything and everyone  Yeah  I was like one of those  Yeah, like a chihuahua  Just pissing on a boy  Coward  Coward  That's one of those  What do you call them?  Cowards  Yeah  Back in what I call the day  Parents would just leave their kids in the car 
[03:13:00]  When they run into the store to get something  Yeah  Just leave the fucking kids in the car  Sure  So when that would happen  I would just be so scared we were going to get stolen  I thought we were going to get kidnapped  And your parents were crying because they knew you wouldn't  And one time this guy that apparently knew my mom  Came over to the car  To say hi  To the kids  So he knocked on the window  I just exploded in screams and crying  I was so scared 
[03:13:30]  And the guy looked like  Oh my god, what happened?  Right  He didn't know what happened  I thought he had come to steal us  Right, yeah  Now you've suddenly put him in like a really awkward position  In a parking lot  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  He's like grabbing you  Like, stop screaming  You be quiet  Stop  Stop  The police show up and shoot him in the head  Your little pants fell down while he was shaking you  His penis slipped into me  Yeah  Yeah  If a child does something unusual around you  That's a really uncomfortable place to be  You know  I fucking 
[03:14:00]  I was doing this gig  At some awful  Like Gary, Indiana  Or whatever  I was in this like mega  Like one of those like  Complexes  Where there's like a holiday inn  Like the Metroplex  Or whatever the fuck  And they have like events there  Or whatever  And they had one of those  Like toddler and tiara things going on  Oh god  Not the TV show  But just like a child beauty pageant  And so there was this like  There were like all these like fucking dolled up six year olds  Wandering around  Like it was so uncomfortable  Nice  I know  It's sometimes  Right  So I go up to my 
[03:14:30]  I go up to my floor  And there's like some twatty moms  That they're like just chatting  And they're ignoring this little girl  Who's wandering around in a fucking prom dress  She's like six  And I'm going down the hall to my room  And the little girl starts walking with me  Oh, little whore  And she  Yeah  She's like  You know  Like what's your name  And whatever  Like she's being a child  Oh, great  Yeah  But it's like  Ah, kid  You better go back with your mom  Yeah, yeah  This is really uncomfortable  And so  And I got my key in my hand  Right  And we get  I get to where my room is 
[03:15:00]  But I'm like  I don't want to go into my room  I don't want this fucking child  Following me into my room  And I keep trying to flag down the twatty mom  But she's not paying attention  You know  And so I got this little girl  Who's just hanging  She's like  She's like  Let me put  Let me use the key  Right  I guess  You know  Because children are excited  By the fucking  Whatever  Like it's like a swipe thing  You know  I don't know  She wants to do  And I'm like  No, no, no, no, kid  And like I'm not  Yeah, I don't need your fingerprints  On this key  That's for sure  Once they find you headless  In a bathroom somewhere  I'm trying to hide it  It's like palmed in my hand  Right  But she knows that it's there  So she starts like  Trying to grab it 
[03:15:30]  Out of my hand  Now you're holding hands  In the hallway  Yeah  Trying to drag her into your room  She keeps  Yeah, she's like grabbing it  And I'm like  Kid, you gotta  And it's like  Okay, this kid's gonna scream  Right  Well, it's like  It's getting worse  Because it's like  Now she's gonna scream  In the hallway  And I can't have that  Yeah  So like  I'm trying to get the mom  So you're smothered in the dust  Yeah, exactly right  You be quiet  Just be quiet  She is fucking  Yeah, exactly  You thought it was a chicken clucking  I don't want to kill you  Quiet  Wow  So I like 
[03:16:00]  Let go of the key  She fucking  Puts the key in the door  And runs into my room  And now I have like  The door  Like the door's gonna close  And that's my only key  And now I'm thinking like  I can't go down to the lobby  Hey, your kid's in my room  There's a fucking six-year-old  In my room  So I have to like  Hold the door open  With my long arm  Like as far as like  And I'm like  Flagging down the mom  In the hallway  Like there's a  Your kid snuck into my  Your kid just came into my room  And died  And there's a fucking  Six-year-old in a prom dress  Like sitting on my bed  Like it's the worst fucking  Like my brain is on fire  Because I'm just so uncomfortable 
[03:16:30]  With this whole scenario  And I finally like  Get the dumb mom  I'm like  Hey, fucking  I don't know what happened  And so the mom  Comes rushing down  And of course like  She doesn't  She's like  I'm so  Like I was thrilled  That she didn't blame me  But at the same time  She like grabs her  Just like  What the fuck is the matter  With you  And like takes her  Oh, man  Yeah, it was just  I just went in  And just like  Just laid on the  My head was just  Fucking on fire  Because it was such uncomfortable  But she knew as the kid, right?  I'll never put myself  In a position like that, though  Where you're like  Alone  But I didn't put myself  In a position  I know  But that's happened  Just the opposite problem  She'd be inside 
[03:17:00]  Trying to run out  Now if there's a public bathroom  And stuff  And you walk in  And you just see a kid in there  Turn right the fuck around  And get out  Yeah  That's it  Bobby Kelly  Hey, buddy  What are you here for the after show?  It's not the after show  It's the Bob and Sam show  Oh, right  The Bob and Sam show  We're not actually calling it that  Come on, don't get out  I love when the Bob and Sam show  Is on for my drive home  Because it means  I can listen to something else  What?  Teasing, of course 
[03:17:30]  Oh, thank God  I'll be listening  It's my favorite show  What?  That you're on?  You're on it  That's why it's your favorite show  Yeah, we were just talking about  Our fucking petrifying moments  With the children  We were talking about  Perceived pedophilia  Yeah  Where there is none there  But it's perceived  Do you know what I realized?  Now that I'm being a  I'm going to be a father  Oh  I didn't  I never thought about kids in my life  I never  I play with them here and there  When they come over  Or whatever  And this little kid 
[03:18:00]  My publicist's kid  Will walk into a radio  And he put his hand up  And he was like  Hold my hand  So I  We're in public  And I grabbed the little kid's hand  Was he just goofing on you?  Hold my hand  Just joking  Hold my hand, man  He goes  Hold my hand  I go, alright  And I'm holding his hand  It's  Like I know  You go to CVS  And you know you didn't steal anything  But you fucking feel like  When you walk through the thing  Yeah  I still feel like  Did I fucking steal  Is it  Like I know I'm not going to fuck this kid  Yeah  But holding his hand 
[03:18:30]  But holding his hand  I still feel  The same thing as the CVS thing  Because you have something in your pocket  That's bulging  See  Like I felt uncomfortable  Holding this little kid's hand  And I was just like  What the fuck is  It's just a little  I'm not  I'm not going to touch his ding ding  Why did you feel uncomfortable  With holding his hand?  I don't know  It's because  Heini was so close  It's just  It's just something  You know  It's just something  I bet you probably wouldn't have felt weird  If the kid wasn't so sexy  Right  He was a little blonde 
[03:19:00]  You know  His little teeth are coming in  Yeah  You know  I love a couple small ones  And the one big one  So you held the kid's hand  Of course I held the kid's hand  But I was walking around  Going I'm not  I'm not  You know  I'm good  I'm just holding a little kid's hand  Yeah  Pedophiles have ruined it for everybody  You can't interact  Also people who molest people  Hey  How you doing?  Whoops  I'm glad for pedophiles  Now I don't have to interact with kids at all 
[03:19:30]  It's great  Kids tell their parents  Stay away from adults  So I never have to feign interest  In those little shitheads  You should thank your look too  When I was in California  I was walking down  I was by our little ranch  Stable area and stuff  And this girl  Is that where you get your girls?  Yeah that's where I got my chicks  No this girl  She got to be I guess  I don't know  Fucking seven or something like that  She comes walking by  And she's just crying  And you gave the guy the money  You go tell her to stop crying  I'm not taking her  Knock this shit off  Exactly  I want a professional actress 
[03:20:00]  Did you blast another one?  I didn't even blast one before  Oh  She did before  So she comes by  And she's crying  So I'm like  What's the matter?  And she's like  I'm lost  Where'd you come from?  And she's like  I don't know  So now  Oh god  It's fucking rancid  Jimmy  So I had to hold her hand  And walk her all around  Like fucking town  Where she's like  I think it's over there  No clue  And then her parents 
[03:20:30]  Were driving by  And jammed on the brakes  And the mother gets out  Like grabbed her hand away from me  And just threw her in the car  And drove off  So you're the guy who took her  Yeah I guess I stole her  Wow  But there were too  There were too much of a rush  To get the target for a sale  To prosecute you  Give me my kid back  Next time  She didn't say thank you?  God damn it Jimmy  She didn't say thank you?  No no  They looked at me  Like I had stolen their kid  Absolutely  Yeah it was  It was great  And I'm walking back  Just going  That sucked 
[03:21:00]  It's a pretty shitty kidnapper  You used to be wandering the streets  Yeah I'd be wandering the streets  And she's pointing  At fucking various locations  She thinks she's from  Right  Like oh that's great  Yeah let me  Get across this river  I had to cross a river  With the fucking kid  Because she said she was  On the other side  Of the river  Oh no one did her parents  Didn't know you were  On the other side of a river  But she said she was  On the other side of the river  And I crossed it  And then she wasn't even over there  Montana  When you walked a crying five year old  Out to the middle of a bridge  That also doesn't look good  Yeah  Where were you? 
[03:21:30]  California  San Juan Capistrano  Nobody walks out there  Except for rapists  And homeless people  Pretty much  It's just you  I was very surprised to see it  With your fucking  Doomsday prepper outfit on  And a kid in your hand  Some Mexican crying baby  I think she was Mexican  Yeah she was  Of course she was  Very scary  Wow  Well I don't want to cut into  The Sam  And of course Bob show  Bob  Bob who kid

What?  Sparkling Bob Kelly  I'm not against it  It's kind of  I think  Because you got the K sound  You got the hard K 
[03:24:30]  In Sparkling  And in Kelly  Yeah but why Sparkling  We got to get to that  Well wait  Because I think you're like  An electric personality  You got a lot of show business  What about Electric Bob?  Well Electric Bob  Is just like  That sounds like a guy  That sounds like a guy  Who's got a van  Who goes and fixes  People's electricity  Well no  Call Electric Bob  Or it's a guy  Who shows up on a horse  With lights all over your  I don't think so  It sounds like the guy  Who makes Bob-O-Pedics  It sounds like the furniture salesman  Or it could be the guy  Who controls lightning  And thunder  It doesn't sound like that guy 
[03:25:00]  See that guy  Sounds more like  Sparkling Bob  Because there's a little  Sparkling Bob sounds like  A guy who shows up  On a fucking unicorn  And solves little girl's problems  It's a little mystique to it though  I don't like Sparkling Bob  Electric Bob  There's no mystique to it  I like  There's no mystique to  Electric Bob  No  It's like  It's an electronic  Salesman  Or fixer guy  Fixer guy  Electronicist  Electronicist?  Yeah  I like Electric Bob  How about Rogue Kelly? 
[03:25:30]  You're back to the Rogue cop?  No  We're just Rogue  I'm just Rogue in general  Like I walk down the street  Somebody's eating like  Popcorn  I slap it out of the hand  Cause you're in my house  And you'll say it like that  Not in my house  What's that  Mutombo commercial I guess  And they go  Yeah  And they're sitting there  And they're going  Tip-tap time  They're going  Bob  Why would you do that?  What's your motivation here?  And you say  I'm Rogue  I'm Rogue  I'm Rogue  I'm Rogue  Not in my house  Not in tip-tap time  It's funny 
[03:26:00]  That'd be a great voice  To have wouldn't it?  Some Bayou  Now somebody's already  Calling for your advice  Sparklin' Bob  Mike in Philly  You're on with  Sparklin' Bob  Sparklin' Bob  Hey  I told you it works  Sparklin' Bob Kelly  We need some unicorn music  As the, you know  E-Rock  See if you can find me  Some kind of pixie dust  Sound effects  Or like a wand  You know  You know  Something like that  You can put it on there  What's going on?  How can Sparklin' Bob?  Hey, my wife's eight months pregnant 
[03:26:30]  And I can't give it to her right now  Right  I was thinking maybe like  You have some advice for me  On what you do  You give it  Yeah  How far along is your wife?  My wife was not pregnant  And I didn't give it to her  Okay  How's that?  Just give it to somebody else  Yeah  No  I haven't had sex  I  First of all  You can't have sex with your wife  I didn't know that  Okay  Because I'm five months pregnant  So I didn't even know that  So you just taught me that  But what I would do  But you didn't know what?  That you can't have sex with your wife  At eight months pregnant  You can't?  You just said that  She said she won't 
[03:27:00]  Oh, she won't  Right  She won't  Is he there?  No, I hung up on him  Why would you hang?  You gotta have  No, we go quick  We go quick  What type of dialogue  Are we gonna have?  It's not a dialogue  He proposes the question  You and I discuss  It's quick  This is the Bob and Sam show  This is not gonna work  It's Sam Roberts  With Sparkling Bob Kelly  Is the name in the show  See?  It's getting a little long  Why do I like it?  We gotta shorten that a little bit  Well, first of all  If you're not gonna have sex with your wife  If she was not giving it to you  That's one story  You can't do it 
[03:27:30]  Because you might poke the baby's soft spot in his head  That's not how it works  The baby is not in the vaginal cavity yet  I know  It's inside the uterus  Right  So you're not gonna get your dick in the uterus  Yeah, but this is how this works  It was a joke  Oh, we're doing comedy on this show  We're gonna throw some jokes in  This isn't Wednesday  Oh, right  Yeah, I was sitting there  I was sitting there  I was sitting there  I was sitting there  What are we giving advice?  That can't work  I would say jerk off in the shower  Do you still  Make sure the water's not hot or cold  Because then it will turn into egg on the ground 
[03:28:00]  And that's a bitch to pick up  And if you step on it  You'll never get it up from between your toes  If it's hot?  Yeah, if the water's too hot in the shower  And you jerk off  Yeah  It will turn into egg  It just fucking steams it  It steams your sperm  And then what do you mean  It'll like fry on the floor?  It looks like  Yeah, it turns into white egg yolk  Like egg whites  You never did that?  No, I guess I don't have the water too hot  Have you jerked off in the shower?  I have, but I don't like jerking off  At all  No  That's not what I was gonna say 
[03:28:30]  Right  In the wetness  I don't like  What?  Like I don't use lotion when I jerk off  Really?  So if you came across a waterfall  You wouldn't  The first thing in your brain  Wouldn't be like  I wish I could jerk off  Under this waterfall  I'd like to get in that waterfall  And masturbate for a while  That's my dream  Look who's making his triumphant return  To After Opie and Anthony Live  What's up, Who Kid?  Who Kid?  Do you jerk off?  Like I was telling Bob Kelly  We were talking about jerking off in the shower  Yeah  It's the after show  It's what we do  It's the Bob Who Kid Sam show  Well, right now  It's Sam Roberts 
[03:29:00]  With Sparkling Bob Kelly  What was it before?  Let me ask you a question  If you walked up to  You're in Hawaii  And you're on a hiking trail  Yeah  And all this  You're by yourself  You got some nuts in your bag  Maybe a little water  So you don't dehydrate  A little trail mix  Right?  Yeah  And you come across  Some oats  Come across a waterfall  The first thing in my brain  The first thing in my brain would be  Let's just get naked  Yeah  And jerk off under the waterfall  Would that be what was in your mind, Who Kid?  Or would you be like  I can't swim  I can't get over here  Yeah, I'll do it by myself  I won't do it with any other guy  If you pass 
[03:29:30]  Who Kid?  Just by yourself  No  I'm not saying would you  If you walked by a waterfall  In that scenario  The first thought in your head  Would say  I'd like to go stand in that waterfall  And masturbate  I hear the waterfall's an icy cloud  I'll probably dip my dick in there  You would  You'd have no choice  But to dip it  Well, I would get hard  I don't like water  When I'm jerking off  I don't like being wet  What are you, a woman?  That's not  That's what I like  I like to be dry  I don't like  I feel  I don't bathe  No, I bathe  But I masturbate separately 
[03:30:00]  I get distracted  Oh, I love  You know what I don't like doing?  No  Don't  Don't ever take a bath  And jerk off  Because that's just  Oh, yeah, that's the worst  Oh, you just get up  And it's  It's just sticking  To you  Oh, because you just jerk off  Into the water  Yeah, that's a bad move  And I don't like fucking girls  In the shower  That's just whack  Yeah, because it dries up  It's not  It's not like  It's no moisture  It's like fucking  I don't know what it is  It's not a good wet  It dries up  It dries up  The natural juices  From the batch  Dry wet, right?  That's why when they show a scene 
[03:30:30]  In a pool  Or in a movie  Where they're fucking  I'm like  That's bullshit  Right  You're not fucking her in a pool  And it's misleading  Because at the beginning  It seems like a great idea  Everything looks so wet  Moist and naked  Chemicals going in that hole  Come on, man  Right  And then you end up  With a little soap  Or shampoo in your pee hole  Yeah, you open up her pussy  In a pool  And she starts screaming  Yeah, I see a mosquito  In there  Come on, man  Hit the infection  It's actually cleaning it out  I heard that  I heard that  That if you want to see  If a chick's pussy  Is clean  Rub your hand 
[03:31:00]  Under your armpit  Get some deodorant on it  And then put it  Like finger fucker  Yeah  And if she starts screaming  Then her pussy's tainted  Because like all the  Disinfectants and stuff  Are hitting it  Either that  Or just deodorant  Isn't meant to go  Inside of a pussy  Yeah  That's probably more of it  Either or  I think that's correct  Actually  I think that's correct  Do you ever get a little soap  Or shampoo in your pee hole?  Who can?  Oh  It's the worst  My lord  Nah  Because sometimes  You don't even realize  Until after  And you go to take a piss  And you think you have an STD  Because it's burning 
[03:31:30]  Can we please have  If Dr. Steve  Anybody's listening  Yeah  My whole life  Yeah  I've wondered why  It feels like somebody  Stuck needles in your pee hole  Yeah  It's that bad  Yeah  When you get the soap in  Or shampoo  Yeah  Because I used to fuck  A shampoo bottle  Remember the old Brett  The big bottle  Now shampoo bottles  Have little squeezy things  Right  But back in the day  They had just an open mouth  Oh like the big  The wide  The wide  Like double wide 
[03:32:00]  And you could stick your dick  Right in it  If you had a mediocre cock  And you could  Who could  You could never do this  No  I was fucking a Tide bottle  I was going in on that  Fucking whisk  I mean yeah  Whisk  Who couldn't fit in the drain  You know  So you were fucking the shampoo  Which bottle  With shampoo in it  Yeah  Because that would be like  The moist  That's the catch all  The moisture  Yeah  No I didn't  I didn't finish off  In my mother's shampoo bottle 
[03:32:30]  You didn't  No but her hair is very nice  I mean it's  She's in her 60s  And it's gorgeous  To this day  Speaking of 60s  My father told me  I was cute today  And I find that very disturbing  What  What  I left  Because you know  He stayed over my crib  He came to visit me from Atlanta  And he's like  Yo you look so cute  He's not Haitian  Yeah he's Haitian  Oh do you have an accent  He's like you're so cute  Wow  When you left  I just left  I don't know  Maybe because I got tight T  I did a push  Was he like making fun of you  Like oh look at you  Cute boy  Like because he thought  Your t-shirt was too tight 
[03:33:00]  He said yo  You're really cute today  Can I just say something  What the fuck is that  I'll tell you why  That's weird  I've seen you cuter  For real  I've seen you cuter  I don't mind you telling me that  But my dad is gay  I don't know  That's weird  If your dad is telling you that  First of all  That's gay  And a pedophile  And a child molesting  I'm 40  How about  How is it  Is there a name for like  Molesting a 40 year old  I don't know  Did it make you feel uncomfortable  I felt uncomfortable  When I left  I didn't even know  How to start the car  I was missing the keyhole 
[03:33:30]  Well first of all  You shouldn't start the car  Last time we talked to you  We found out you were in jail  Because you had nine suspensions  On your license  I stole myself  If you're a 40 year old  How old is your dad  He's 66  Yeah you're still  I mean it's still young  He was looking at me  Like he said  Yo you really look cute today  I was like what  I would love it  If your dad tried to  Fucking molest you  With a crazy accent  We got Dr. Steve  On the phone  Dr. Steve  First of all  You've seen it all  You've done it all  Is there  Can child abuse exist  Into adulthood 
[03:34:00]  Like say for a 40 year old man  That's ridiculous  That's not medical  That's psychological  Yeah but he's seen it all  Dr. Steve  He knows he's a wise guy  My father is  Psychological abuse  Can occur  Like if who kid  He's a 40 year old man  Although black don't crack  You'd never know it  40 years old  Yeah you'd never know it  Yeah man  41 man  That's even worse  If he leaves the house  And his dad says  You're looking very cute today  That's abuse  Is it not  I mean he can say  I'm handsome  Or yo you got some  Hot gear on  Or you know  What about this 
[03:34:30]  Yo yo  You look mad  Fucking cute  I would cry  Is that  That's not good  What about this  Yo yo yo  I was like  Yo man  What if your dad  Was like  Yo yo  Your dick's bumping  But he said it  With ebonics  So it's like  You know  Maybe I would let that go  I don't know  I do got a big dick  I mean  You can't deny it  Your dad's noticed  He probably has one too  I never saw my father's dick  Yeah  I saw my mother's pussy  I never saw my father's dick  Wow  When did you see  Your mom's pussy  Yesterday 
[03:35:00]  Please don't say yesterday  Not yesterday  Hell  That shit's like  Fucking  When I was like 16  When you were 16  You saw your mom's  Why  I used to  Go under  You know  When my mother  You know  Haitians  Like Caribbeans  They bathe in the toilet bowl  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  What  They wash their pussies  In the toilet bowl  So what they do  Is they have  There's a pill  Can I ask one question  Yeah go ahead  Do you have  Is there a shower  A sink  And a toilet bowl  Or is it just a toilet bowl  No there's a shower  But they're Haitian  They're crazy  They don't care about  Yeah fuck it  Okay so they're in the shower 
[03:35:30]  So she washes her pussy  And they're like  Oh I'll wash my pussy  After I get out of the shower  When I'm taking a piss  So you get out  So you get out of the shower  Go over to the toilet bowl  Take a piss  Then you wash your pussy  No  Okay  She doesn't use the shower  She just washes that bush  Cause you know  It's like the 80's  She  Okay so she's not shaving  She's washing  Your mom's washing  Her Haitian vagina  In the toilet  But I  Straddling the bowl  Right  Straddling  Yeah that's  Straddling the bowl  It's kind of genius  It's a perfect pussy washing device  No it's not 
[03:36:00]  It's for shitting in  Actually  If you turn around  They don't have that  They don't have that in Europe  Who can  That's a bidet  It's not a toilet  If you turn around  And stand over the toilet  It's a perfect pussy washing device  If I was going to make a pussy washer  It would be in the shape of a toilet  Dr. Steve  You support the toilet  As a pussy washer  The  If it didn't have urine  And fecal matter  In it  Absolutely  Yeah  Whoa whoa whoa whoa  Fecal matter  It's a separate device 
[03:36:30]  Yes it is  I agree with Bob  It is the perfect pussy washing device  Steve  There is  In the toilet bowl  Okay  In the water  That's in the toilet bowl  Right  There's fecal matter  Or is it from the toilet itself  Left over from the last time you  It's not the actual water  The water coming from the wall  You can clean yourself with  Exactly right  Okay good  Yeah but you get your residue  Like you know when you leave skid marks  On the bottom of the toilet or whatever  All that stuff is washed into that water  You know what I mean 
[03:37:00]  Like there's little fecal matter  In every toilet water  Has a little bit of shit in it  Right  But I used to wash my mother all the time  So I know she has some clean pussy  You used to wash your mother?  No watch her  Oh  Wash her  Wash her pussy?  While she's washing her pussy  Why did you do that?  Because  That's a great question Bob Kelly  Did you not have toys?  I mean I don't know  I was a curious dude  Did they have Atari?  He's blaming it on curiosity  Alright so you used to wash your mom  Wash her pussy  Let me explain  The doors we had  The bathroom doors  We made of fucking curtains  Alright 
[03:37:30]  You are perfect just like me  There's a door  There's a door  You know the door  The bathroom door  There's a little  There's a little gap  At the bottom  And you could go under there  And look  Usually you're supposed to look at a teenager taking a bath  But I used to wash my mother  So it was like kind of curvy  You used to  When your mom was  So your mom's in the bathroom  Yeah  And she's sitting on the toilet  Straddling the bowl  As Dr. Steve would say  Yeah  And she's washing her vagina with toilet water  Yeah  And you're 16 years old  And she's very bushy  And you have your head to the floor  Yes  Looking through the crack 
[03:38:00]  Watching your  Watching your mom wash  You have no right  To fucking come down on your dad  For calling you cute  I don't know  Yeah you are fucked up dude  I thought that was normal  I don't think a father  Should call a 40 year old cute  I don't think a 16 year old  Should watch his mom  Washing her vagina  I was in puberty  No dude  Puberty is not  Dr. Steve  Can we have a calling  A ruling on the field  Puberty is 16  Or younger  Oh  Puberty  Definitely younger than  Okay  Alright  Even in Haiti  Dr. Steve 
[03:38:30]  Even in Haiti  Yeah yeah yeah  Okay  I lost my virginia at 19  You know this  You were a late bloomer  But that's because  That's because you wanted  To have sex with your mother  You think so  Yeah  Yeah  So that's the thing  I'm kind of with  Who Kid on that one  Wait you're kind of  With Who Kid on which one  Watching your mom  No I mean just  I had mommy issues  You know I was always  Attracted to women  That reminded me of my mother  Yeah but  At the age of  Big giant tits  And I just  Sold her mine  Jesus Christ  What the fuck  What's going on  Mama has some big ass titties too  Yeah but you're not  Supposed to be attracted  To your mom's titties

Who kid? 
[03:40:30]  I think I was just  Rather watch her though  Cause I like seeing her naked  Would you ever touch yourself  While you watched your mom?  Nah cause my neck was hurting  Going under that door  Would you?  Cause you know  You have to bend under there  No sure yeah  If you had to  Whack off and look under that peephole  It's a ridiculous concept  If you looking through a keyhole  Yeah  You could have maybe jerked off  Yeah but the hole was too small  But under there was a big gap  Old school keys  Like the big  The big goofy  Yeah  Like farmer joints  Yeah  Right  Maybe but  So would you ever  Projects  And would that ever 
[03:41:00]  Come back into your mind  When you were jerking off though  Would you later be like  Oh shit my mom was looking good today  It's kind of blank  I don't really remember things  You don't remember  Yeah well that's called  Blocking it out  Who kid  That's called blocking out memories  I just remember her titties  That's it  Wow  And pussy  You were talking about her vagina  A minute ago  Cause she got the  What do you call the things  The doctor  What do you call that  Hemorrhoids  No the titties  Nipples  Areolas  Areolas  Areolas like really big ones  How about you  Dr. Steve  Your mom  How are her areolas  I don't know that I ever saw them 
[03:41:30]  I just would see the impression of them  Behind the silky  Steve  Steve can I just  This is so fucking sick  Hang on one second  Steve I just want to remind you  This is being recorded  And broadcast  Out over  So you have family  If kids  You're a doctor  Okay  Why do you think  Dr. Steve  Has never gone by a last name  In his life  Oh my god  Let me ask you a question  Steve  Just to get back to the original topic  Before we start about mom fucking  There was an original topic  There was an original talk  Before mom fucking  The actual 
[03:42:00]  Peeing when you pee  When you jerk off with shampoo  Or soap  And a little bit gets in your peel  Why does it burn  Why does it fucking sting so much  It's because it's mucous membrane bro  It's mucous membrane bro  Bro  It's mucous membrane  You want to hit a wave man  You hit a wave  But if you're going to jerk off with soap  It's mucous membrane bro  What the fuck  Point break  My favorite band bro  Mucous membrane's plain  This guy got a hood diploma man  Yo dude listen 
[03:42:30]  Why is it hurt when you piss man  After you jerk off  My mucous membrane's burning bro  Yeah because listen  Let me tell you what the worst thing  To jerk off with is  Your mom's hand  Is  Dr. Steve's the only guy  Sitting there  He's watching Psycho  And he's going like  Yeah I don't see what's so wrong  With this guy  Now Vicks VapoRub  Is the worst stuff in the world  To jerk off with it  You get this nice warm feeling  While you're doing it 
[03:43:00]  And after you complete the transaction  It is the most intense  Horrendous pain  Do not buy this at home  And if any of that  Gets in the mucous membrane  Of the urethra  Spicy  Burning for  For many many minutes  Afterwards  So you have  That's what it is  Is it's just an irritant  To that mucous membrane  That  That mucous membrane  Of the urethra  Is designed  To pass through urine  So it'll do that  And jizz  And semen  That's exactly right  We call it jizz  On this show  Okay  Or splooge 
[03:43:30]  Or whatever you want to call it  No we say jizz  Okay  We say magic hair juice  Jizz  Jizz  Bro  But shampoo  No  We call it bus  Vaporub  No  What's it called bus  No detergent  Big is a bus  Caustic to mucous membranes  So don't jerk off  With shampoo or soap  No no no no  And if you do  Yeah  Make sure you wash it off  Afterward  Don't do like I did  When I was 13  And jerked off  With shampoo  And then fell asleep  And didn't wash it off  And woke up with 
[03:44:00]  Jesus  On the skin of my penis  Flaking off  Oh  You're like  Oh I gotta get this  Like hardened cum  Off my dick  And then you find out  It is your dick  Jesus  Oh  Damn  You lizard  God damn  Well thank you Dr. Steve  For clearing all that up  Thank you  For clearing all that up  We're all holding  Our penises right now  I'm holding who kids  I thought it was mine  But he actually put his  Over on my lap  He's got a big one  Two hands  I saw the biggest dick  In the world yesterday  Where  I know you had Josh Matthews
