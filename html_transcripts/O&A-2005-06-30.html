<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with chaotic audio featuring repeated shouts of "Thank you" and "Fuckin' idiots!", culminating in chants of "O-N-A Body Rock!". The hosts then begin the broadcast by discussing Opie's severe digestive issues stemming from laxative and enema use, resulting in a headache and a bathroom emergency.  They also mention a possible Billy Bob Thornton sighting.  Opie then recounts his frustration with an intern who handed him a plastic knife by the blade, triggering an outburst and a discussion of Opie's germaphobia, contrasted with Anthony's meticulous hygiene. They reminisce about past unhygienic experiences.

A substantial portion of the show centers on a news story about a racial assault in Howard Beach, where three Black men were attacked, one suffering a fractured skull, after allegedly attempting car theft. Opie and Anthony debate whether it qualifies as a hate crime, questioning the media's portrayal and suggesting the victims deserved the assault due to their criminal activity.  Numerous listener calls follow, filled with racial slurs and offensive language, debating the incident and offering various perspectives, including generalizations about different ethnic groups.  A recurring, offensive theme involves stereotypical descriptions of Italian-Americans and their lawn care. A caller recounts a large-scale brawl at a party in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

In-studio guests Rich Voss and his fiancée Bonnie join, shifting the conversation to Voss's recent birthday party filmed for a Comedy Central pilot, including anecdotes about Patrice O'Neal's excessive food order.  The hosts then satirize local news broadcasts with clips featuring sensationalist headlines like "hairstyle leads to murder" and "exploding cell phones."  A caller provides a running tally of increasingly absurd news teases.  Discussions include a taser, a listener's Paul Anka impression, and numerous accounts of midget sightings, fueled by listener calls.  Jobby from Alabama calls in with another bizarre news story about metal shavings in iced tea, and Kevin provides a lengthy, critical (and humorous) review of *War of the Worlds*, with a listener-created Tom Cruise remix played. The segment also features banter about a sleepy crew member ("Big Kev"), a sound engineer ("Eric") accidentally playing a song, and extended discussion of Melanie's "I've Got a Brand New Pair of Roller Skates."

The show moves on to an off-mic conversation before transitioning to a discussion of a previous encounter with Joy Behar and a near-miss at securing bad seats for a Trump roast, then to a perceived slight towards Bonnie by Star Jones.  A detailed, sexually explicit account of a misinterpreted phone call follows.  Caller Frank recounts his life update, crediting the show for inspiring his divorce and a relationship with a prostitute who developed a crush on him.  The hosts then discuss an email detailing rumors about Tom Cruise's sexuality and his relationship with Katie Holmes, alleging a rushed engagement to cover up a scandal involving Rob Thomas.  The discussion is filled with sexually explicit language, speculation, and personal anecdotes, including a potentially implied childhood sexual experience by one host.  The segment concludes with discussions of Tom Brokaw's lisp, another inappropriate studio incident, an audio clip of a child being yelled at while playing Xbox, and Jimmy sharing his less-than-satisfactory experience getting his AIDS and syphilis test results.

The final segment begins with Opie recounting a frustrating experience with a doctor.  Listener calls ensue, including one about a child's cursing and another requesting an AIDS test "cheat sheet." Opie discusses his new car, leading to celebrity impressions.  A significant portion involves sexually explicit jokes about news reporter Pat Battle.  The hosts detail the arrest of a naked would-be rapist in the Hamptons.  The show ends with more quick listener calls, further jokes about Pat Battle, the hosts' repeated "I'm out of here" exclamations, a preview of the next day’s show (mentioning True Bogey, the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, and a cancelled promotion), and a visual gag involving a producer’s genitalia.

[00:05:00]  Goddammit, are you fuckin' with me?  Call me sir, goddammit!  Goddammit!  Stop it!  All on the radio rips me off.  Tell him, Fred.  Stop whining! Stop whining!  I don't care! I don't care!  Stop it! I honestly don't care!  Shut up! Shut up!  Quiet.

[00:06:00]  And that's how we begin another Opie and Anthony experience.  We like to call it the O&A virus spreading across America.  Are you infected?  Tune in at 11.  Wait till we play the news teases that we got overnight.  Oh, my God.  You guys are doing a great job so far with that.  Gonna love them.  I feel a little low today.  Yeah, I don't know.  Something sounds a little weird in my headphones as well. 
[00:06:30]  A little different.  Like the music was really loud so I couldn't turn it up.  There we go.  All right, let's try that.  All right.  That'll just blow out my ears later on when we play something off the board.  My ears are severely damaged.  What?  Since coming to XM.  I'm telling you.  Because you get such a sharp sound in the headphones.  Yeah.  When I'm in restaurants and stuff and you're sitting across the table from someone, I can't  hear them anymore.  Huh?  I just can't hear them anymore.  I'm going to start walking around with a pen and a pen.  Get a hearing aid. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, it's awful.  And I'm trying to turn down the volume of the headphones.  What did he say?  Remember that old commercial for a big hearing aid?  Yeah.  And it was the husband and wife and they're sitting there watching a movie.  And the husband's just this crotchety old bastard.  And he had to keep turning around going, what did he say?  He was like all angry.  We need that audio clip for our machines.  What did he say?  What did he say?  All right, he's trying to watch the movie.  Can't hear shit.  He's all pissed off.  And the wife's all annoyed because she's got to repeat everything that's being said.  What did he say? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  We have so much to do today.  Steve's getting the news teases together.  Yeah.  They're so funny.  I heard a couple of them in the office and they're better than I could have imagined.  Absolutely.  We joke about them.  We talk about them.  And then when you hear them and they're worse than what we were even goofing about, it's  just hysterical.  Can't wait to play those.  They love to scare us.  That's your assignment, America.  Yes.  Assignment America.  We want you to watch your local news and send in their fear. 
[00:08:00]  Yep.  The fear they throw at you every night on the news.  How they scare you on a nightly basis.  We'll have some examples in a few minutes here.  But first, where do we begin?  I know.  We'll get into the story of the day in a second.  But can I just start with something a little silly?  Why?  Because I know we're going to get real serious for about 20 minutes and we should.  I might have to run out of the studio at any given moment.  Oh, Jesus.  It's working?  You're kidding.  What?  It's working?  What?  Whatever it is you took?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, everyone knows I have like a dumping problem.  It's your diet.  No.  You eat cement.  It's morning radio.  I'm telling you.  Although, you saw what I ate yesterday for breakfast.  Uh-huh.  The roof of my mouth is all cut up.  All shards.  Yeah, because it's like, it's pretty much twigs.  Uh-huh.  It's twigs and little, remember the little dirt bombs when you were growing up?  Yeah.  That's what my cereal is.  Little dirt bombs and twigs.  And what do you think that does in your intestine? 
[00:09:00]  It binds together like, like, paste and just sits there blocking the passage.  Dude, I'm on the same roll of toilet paper.  I must have got it three months ago.  You, oh, Jesus.  Three, barely wiping.  The baby wipe takes care of the cranky ass and I'm all set to go.  But I'll go like two days without going, man.  No.  I've been to the doctor.  Everything's normal, so to speak.  Then it's your diet, so to speak. 
[00:09:30]  So he gives me all these things.  These things, like the Metamucil.  He wants me to take a Metamucil.  And then he gives me some softeners.  They're called softeners.  This is not what you should be doing.  Oh, dude, these are in stages.  So I got the Metamucil.  Then I got the softeners, right?  Yeah.  Then I got the enema that just kind of sits there.  That's like the end all right there.  And then in between the enema and the softeners is the laxative. 
[00:10:00]  So yesterday on the show...  Your medicine cabinet must just look like a 65-year-old man's medicine cabinet.  Does it?  Just like enemas and suppositories and Metamucil.  Metamucil.  What the fuck?  Metamucil?  Don't forget my athlete's foot sprays.  I just always remember my grandfather, like, sipping down some heartburn medicine all the time. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I got the heartburn.  And things like Metamucil.  So, well, you know, so...  So, yesterday, the last hour of the show, I had such a bad headache that I couldn't even focus.  Now, you get bad headaches when you're backed up.  Yeah, because it's the toxins in your body.  Yeah.  I went to the doctors, and they're like, absolutely.  If you don't clear yourself out, these toxins are basically telling your body, hello.  Hello.  Dude, eat a shitload of grapes on a daily basis. 
[00:11:00]  I'm trying everything.  And the listeners, they've been really cool, actually.  The email I get, it's kind of embarrassing.  I should bring some of them in.  That is embarrassing.  Because they all have their home remedies.  So, uh...  But sick.  Huh?  But sick.  So, yesterday, after the show, I went right home.  I was walking home with Jimmy.  Remember, Jimmy?  And I wasn't even...  Jimmy and I usually talk, because we live in the same neighborhood now.  And, uh...  I was barely talking, because my head hurts so much.  And we were on Billy Bob Thornton alert, too. 
[00:11:30]  And I couldn't even help little Jimmy with that.  What?  Well, we walk home, and, uh...  What day was that?  Monday?  Monday?  As we're walking...  Yes, I was talking about Billy Bob Thornton.  I was quoting something he said about Angelina Jolie.  Mm-hmm.  And as I said that...  We think he walked by.  Right by us.  That's insane.  And I think that's what threw us off.  Because we were talking about Billy Bob Thornton, Bad News Bears, and Angelina Jolie, and all  that, like Jimmy said.  And just as he's...  Like he said, he's quoting, you know, what Billy said. 
[00:12:00]  And Billy Bob Thornton, we think, walked by.  And like, come on.  Stop.  What are the odds?  Yeah.  Dude, you looked at me, and I looked at you.  It was like one of those things we both...  It wasn't like, wow, this guy looks like him.  It was...  He looked at him, I looked at him, and it was like, that is him.  That is him.  It looks so much like him, it's like it couldn't be him.  Yeah.  You know, it's got to be a guy who just looks exactly like it was him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not sure still, though.  I don't mean it either.  We're really not sure, but it drove us nuts, the rest of the walk.  So ever since, because we found out that he lives in the area, we've been on Billy Bob Thornton 
[00:12:30]  alert.  Ah.  Because the next time he walks by, we'll be ready.  Hammer ready.  Yeah, Jimmy will be ready for his celebrity photo.  Bill!  Touch his arm.  Bill!  So we were on Billy Bob Thornton alert yesterday, and walking home, and I was barely talking  to Jimmy, because my head was killing me.  So I went home, and I took the nap, took the aspirin, drank a lot of water, because maybe  I'm dehydrated a little bit.  Yeah.  None of that was really working, so I had to go into the medicine cabinet.  Oh, you had to take... 
[00:13:00]  I had to go to stage three.  Stage three?  Well, yeah, stage one is like Metamucil.  Right.  Stage two is the softener.  Softener.  Ugh.  Stage three is the laxative, and stage four is the enema.  So I took that, like, late in the afternoon.  You gotta time that shit out, man.  Well, you certainly do.  It says on the box, like, pretty much, don't move six hours later, or something like that.  Really?  Yeah, something, whatever they say.  Yeah, basically, it warns you that, you know... 
[00:13:30]  You don't want to take it, and then six hours be in, like, a meeting at the office or something.  Yeah, you don't want to be at a Mets game.  No.  You don't want to be at a Mets game.  You don't want to be on a long drive somewhere.  No.  When you take a laxative, you gotta plan it out.  You're exactly right.  Yeah.  You don't take a laxative and then decide to drive up to Boston for the 4th of July weekend.  A toilet must be within a 20-foot perimeter.  Oh, yeah.  The entire time.  Because even if you want to hold it in, it ain't staying in, man.  Ooh.  It ain't staying in.  So I wasn't really thinking about that, so I just kind of took it late afternoon. 
[00:14:00]  And also, I had a horrendous night's sleep because I woke up in the middle of the night.  Boom.  My stomach was making whale noises.  And I could just...  Sounds like you're below deck in a schooner.  Right.  A schooner on the high seas, just creaking wood. 
[00:14:30]  That's the worst.  But the problem was, like, it started way up here, like, almost in the middle of my chest,  a little lower, right above the belly button, okay?  Yeah.  And then just as the night progressed, it just, this, like, it was like pain, like heartburn  almost, you know, like kind of whatever.  Yeah.  It was slowly moving down, moving down, moving down, moving down.  Where it needs to be.  Moving down.  The exit.  Now it's just above my pubic bone as the alarm clock wakes me up at five o'clock. 
[00:15:00]  Uh-oh.  And right to the bathroom.  Oh, it was ready to rock?  Oh, my God.  Completely lost my insides.  Oh, God.  Dude.  I saw stuff in there that I ate, like, I don't know, last week.  I'm like, peanut butter and jelly.  I had that, like, Friday.  If you're saying peanut butter and jelly, perhaps it's not peanut butter and jelly. 
[00:15:30]  That could be, like, your spleen and some bile clots.  Just blood on taffy.  But now I'm just feeling kind of light on my feet today.  Light on my feet.  Feeling all loosey-goosey.  All ready to rock.  Very agile.  Agile, I should say.  Stop eating that cereal.  I guarantee you, stop eating that cereal and you won't have that problem anymore.  What?  Optimum power?  Whatever the hell it is.  It's ridiculous.  They sell you on this crap. 
[00:16:00]  Optimum power.  Like, that's going to get you through your day.  It's not going to get you through your day.  It's going to bind you up.  It doesn't even come in a cool box like real cereal.  It comes in, like, a bag.  Oh, no, that's my granola.  That's ridiculous, too.  Don't eat cement.  I eat a lot of protein and a lot of granola and a lot of oatmeal and a lot of optimum power.  You eat like a bovine.  You're eating like a cow or something.  You have one stomach. 
[00:16:30]  It's not meant for, like, all that grain and stuff.  Just slap a feed bag on Opie with a microphone in it.  So you can do the show and just graze on oats.  I think I got it just about out, though.  Yeah?  I got a little gurgling happening.  A little...  You need fruit.  I'm percolating a little bit.  Just slightly right now.  The intestines need fruit.  That's what you need.  But, man, I just didn't time it right.  Yeah.  Because all night...  Sounds like that movie. 
[00:17:00]  What was that?  The Grudge.  The Grudge.  Oh, yeah.  Your stomach starts making the grudge noises.  Definitely sounded like that.  Definitely.  So, you know, and the headache went away instantly.  That's great.  Now I get to start packing more stuff into my body.  That's not a good thing to tell people, that when you get backed up, you get a headache.  Gets that whole, you know, shit for brains thing. 
[00:17:30]  I know.  Whatever.  It's like I take a dump and my head doesn't hurt anymore.  Where's that crap backing up to Opie?  Well, I got a lot of crap in my brain.  I know that.  Ouch.  I do know that.  So, well...  I was a little impatient this morning with one of the interns.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get into that.  My God.  I'm sitting on the couch.  We're all just in a really good mood because we got these news teasers that made us laugh  really hard. 
[00:18:00]  And we got a huge story we're going to get into in a few minutes here that's going to  get people thinking and talking today.  And Anthony got his breakfast order.  We have a new crop of interns.  They're great, by the way.  Here.  Some would scare the shit out of them, which is unfortunate.  What?  They're all jumpy.  They're very jumpy.  They're all like little chihuahuas that wet the rug whenever their owner comes in.  They just freak out.  And early on, when we first started the show, we got a crop of interns that turned out to  just be gold.  Right.  I hate kissing their ass and stuff, but they really did. 
[00:18:30]  They turned out to be very good.  And it really raised the bar for anybody that's going to be coming into this place.  And since then, we've had some lemons, and now we have a new crop that is proving themselves  to be worthy.  Very good.  And they're so attentive in the morning with getting this food and beverage for everybody.  So this morning, I got my bagel, toasted bagel, with some cream cheese on the side, because  I like dolloping it on myself. 
[00:19:00]  And I get it.  You don't like dolloping it on yourself.  You just don't want anyone else to touch anything.  Well, that's true, too.  And they always decide to put, like, a brick of cream cheese on your bagel.  What the hell is that about?  I just want a little, as the Jewish people say, a little schmear on the bagel.  That's all.  So, um, I need a plastic knife.  And what the hell's his goddamn name?  Mike. 
[00:19:30]  Mike.  Mike.  Mike, the young go-getter.  It's Mike.  Mike, the intern.  He, uh, comes in, gets me the, gives me the bagel, and then gives me one of the plastic  knives.  And how does he hand me the plastic knife?  Ugh.  Ugh.  I see him walking in with the knife.  Why is that a problem?  And he's holding it by the blade.  It's just awful.  Of the plastic knife.  The side that I'm going to put in the cream cheese and put on the bagel.  But why is that a problem, really?  Because it's somebody's hand.  But I would just take my shirt or whatever and just wipe it fast and boom. 
[00:20:00]  The germs are gone.  Look at all of us throughout the day.  Mm-hmm.  Look at our hands and look what they do on a daily basis.  They're pawing through newspapers that some savage is putting on his newspaper stand.  They're, you know, up nostrils.  They're picking ears.  You're coughing into them.  I don't know what people are doing.  So then they hold the, he holds the knife by the blade.  He comes over and I just instantly, what popped out of my mouth, I couldn't even hold  it back. 
[00:20:30]  It was really funny.  It popped out of me before I even knew what I was doing.  Let me tell everyone what Howard Hughes said to the intern.  Tell me what you did.  He comes over and he hands it to me.  This is an exact quote.  I had to write it down.  Tell me what you did.  He hands it to me and I go, tell me what you did.  Tell me what you did.  And he jumped.  He went, oh, I'll get another.  And like freaked out, ran, got another knife.  These guys are all frazzled.  They're so frazzled.  But I didn't even go like, excuse me, the knife was it.  I just looked right at him and went, tell me what you did. 
[00:21:00]  That's how you should handle that.  It jumped out of me so fast that I started laughing at myself that that even came out  of me.  It was funny.  Tell me what you did.  These guys are working for free.  Then I rolled up the daily news and smacked him on the nose.  I shoved his face on the knife on the floor and went, no, what did you do?  Bad intern.  And he knew and he ran and got you another knife.  Yeah, he'll never hand it to me blade first.  You germaphobe.  But beforehand, he'll probably stick it up the crack of his ass and then hand it to me. 
[00:21:30]  I've ruined that.  I can't have him get me breakfast anymore because now I'm afraid he's going to spit in it.  Right.  You have to bring your own knife now, psychopath.  See?  In the back pocket.  I do.  I'll bring a box of plastic knives and keep them on my bed.  I have no idea you had this in you, this whole germ thing.  It's not really a germ thing.  I don't know, man.  It's not about the germs.  It really isn't.  It's about being disgusted by bodily fluids.  I'm not afraid of the germs that are in snot.  People have this misconception that I'm a germaphobe.  I'm not afraid of germs that are in mucus. 
[00:22:00]  I hate mucus.  I'm not afraid of germs that are on people's hands from earwax or that.  I just think it's disgusting.  Do you know that Anthony is the only person alive that has never picked his nose?  I don't believe he's never picked.  I've picked.  Are you sure?  I use a tissue on my finger.  Finger.  You never just got in there?  Finger.  You never just got in there and went to town?  No.  There have been times I've had to, but it's definitely not around any other people.  On the job site, back in the day, when I was working for a living? 
[00:22:30]  That's what I don't understand.  You used to do some crazy things on the job site, and now...  Opie, those things are necessary for your own survival.  Now, a stupid plastic knife with maybe an intern's thumbprint on it drives you nuts.  It's anybody's hand.  You used to shit in...  Spackle buckets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old days.  That's what I did.  And there was no toilet paper around, right?  No, no.  You had to use toilet paper.  Stop.  What would you think I was going to wipe with?  Although, once I think I wiped with an old T-shirt.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  And then I put it back on and continued working.  I was walking...  Me and my friend Paul McKay were walking to steal comic books years ago, and I had to  take out, like, one of those dumps.  It's almost like if you don't shit now, you're just going to collapse in the street.  Yeah.  Your legs actually give out on you.  We'd walk three miles from home, all these comic books, and I had to go into this woods  area, and I'm taking a dump, and as I'm shitting, there's yellow jackets flying in between  my legs.  What kind of a caveman dump were you taking?  It was awful.  There was bees flying around.  Oh.  I think I had to use my underwear to wipe my ass and throw it out. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, it was awful.  Sometimes you got to do what you got to do.  Old salt and vinegar potato chip crack is what I had walking.  Let's go to the Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch!  I'm sorry, man.  I'm still laughing at Norton.  Sorry, guys.  What are you doing?  Anthony, you are going to end up with fucking plastic over your furniture like my old Italian  grandmother.  You are a complete fucking germaphobe, man.  Complete germaphobe.  You're going to have psychosis.  No.  I saw Bubble Boy the other night. 
[00:24:00]  Did you?  The John Travolta movie there?  What was Bubble Boy?  Boy in a Plastic Bubble.  Boy in a Plastic Bubble.  Boy in a Plastic Bubble.  Boy in a Plastic Bubble.  Boy in a Plastic Bubble.  And I was, look, I'm in a bubble.  I was, I was, Sandy, I'm in a bubble.  I was thinking of Anthony.  All right, Coach.  Yeah.  Later, fellas.  I got to.  Hey, by the way, Danny, can you get rid of everyone that wants to talk about my dumping problem  with their remedies?  This guy says, Anthony, I hope you never accept change from a cab driver in New York City.  I work for New York City, and whenever a cab is involved in an accident, you can always 
[00:24:30]  find a bottle of urine under the driver's seat.  That's how they go to the bathroom.  So you know they're not very clean, and they're probably dribbling on themselves if you've  ever taken a leak in any kind of a bottle or anything.  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes.  And, yeah, and then they're just handing your money back.  And by the way, no, I don't care.  I will never accept change from a cab driver.  Really?  I swear, I just hand them whatever I have.  If the ride is five bucks, I'll hand them a 20 if that's all I got, and go, yeah, keep  it. 
[00:25:00]  See?  I can't touch.  Another example.  Dude, I can't touch a cab driver.  The pills are filthy, though, even if he's not touching that dirty.  No matter what money you have, it's dirty.  Yeah, but, yuck.  As long as I don't see it, I see his filthy, urine-ridden hand.  It's odd to watch somebody slowly go down the slope.  I know, I know.  It's not fast.  It's little things.  It's tiny.  I've got to start keeping a list, because you're so right.  The slow slope, right, yeah.  And he's smart enough to be able to justify it, like, very, like, no, dude, it's not. 
[00:25:30]  You think Howard Hughes just said, I'm a nut?  No.  Of course he didn't.  He said, oh, no, no.  It's just that, you know, five layers is what you need to open the skin.  That man was a genius.  He was.  Yes, he was.  Some people think you're a genius, Anthony.  Well.  That's right.  But another side of your brain is rotting away, man.  Something is happening.  Something's happening.  But I'm glad to report that you're wearing a shirt I've seen before.  Oh, right.  Okay.  And you know something?  When I put this on this morning, I went, I think this is a familiar shirt they might 
[00:26:00]  notice.  Yes.  This is a...  Because in the dark, I thought it was a periwinkle shirt for a second.  Not that we study each other's dress habits here, but we see each other every morning,  and everyone has noticed that you just don't have a rotation.  Yeah.  This is the first shirt.  And I'm not even kidding.  This is not a bit for the radio.  This is the first shirt I recognize that you have worn before.  Like, you know, Jimmy's worn that shirt.  Sabra-cadabra.  Probably a hundred times.  Probably.  Yeah.  Your, like, periwinkle shirt with the red around the neck.  This isn't periwinkle. 
[00:26:30]  What is it?  That's corn...  Dude, this is not periwinkle.  Cornfield blue or whatever it's called.  Cornflower.  It's cornflower blue.  It's just a light baby blue.  Baby blue.  Baby blue.  It's got, like, a white undertone, too.  It's like a cloud blue.  It's nice.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cloud.  It's not that bad.  No, it's nice.  The problem with me is...  The problem with me today is I got the jeans on that I started wearing...  Oh, no.  What day are we up to?  Oh, Jesus.  Thursday.  These go back to last Friday.  Last Friday. 
[00:27:00]  Easily.  Yeah.  Don't you know...  Dude, I do the smell test.  We don't have big meetings or things to do after the show, so as long as it's not,  you know, reeking, I throw them back on.  Here's the thing, though.  New underwear and all that.  You rollerblade in in the hot weather.  Right.  And then you...  Without only, you know, bathroom breaks and stuff, but for the most part, we're doing  no breaks for an hour, an hour and a half sometimes, that you're just sitting.  Mm-hmm.  Sitting after sweating.  I agree.  Not good. 
[00:27:30]  I do the smell test, though, but quick smell.  There's a bunch of stuff on my floor.  How about just wash them instead of sniffing around?  The sad part is I got at least 10 to 12 pairs of jeans.  They're just waiting.  They're all nice and clean and ready to go.  And then there's a bunch of jeans on my floor, and then I do like a lot of guys do.  You start looking around your bedroom floor, and you pick up a few things, smell them.  If they smell okay, you throw them back on. 
[00:28:00]  If we had something important to do, then, yeah, I'd make sure everything is clean and ready to go.  You know what's not accurate about the smell test, though?  Sometimes on the floor, you can pick it up, and it doesn't smell bad at all.  When you start wearing them, though, the second anything happens, any bodily moisture, any sweat, or anything,  and it just brings out its true aroma.  It's hiding in there.  Every once in a while, I'll fail the smell test, and I'll be sitting here going,  and I just want to go home immediately.  How often do you do your laundry or have it done? 
[00:28:30]  I don't know, like once every two weeks, I guess.  Why don't you have the Pollock show up every weekend, though?  She's too busy cleaning the rest of the place.  Her awful accent and her cigarette smoke.  Really?  She smokes?  She smokes?  Oh, yeah, she smokes outside.  They all do.  They all do, though, those Europeans.  But she likes her rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  She wants me to turn on the rock and roll for her.  Have her come home once a week and fetch your clothes.  How about this for a smell test, quickly?  Me and my chick are in a restaurant eating, and some woman has a baby, 
[00:29:00]  and right in the middle of the restaurant, she goes,  Oh, I think somebody has a dirty diaper or something.  Picks the baby up.  Picks this friggin' baby up.  Shoves her nose right into the baby's ass and starts sniffing.  You live in a whole different world.  I don't have kids, obviously.  Yeah.  You didn't know that?  Mothers do that all the time.  In a restaurant where people are eating.  I know.  Where my children come to play with their toys.  And then she didn't have the courage to pass the kid around. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, appetizers.  That's what mothers do.  To see if they need to change the diaper.  You know, if you're trying to eat.  In the old days, you took a little peek.  Nowadays, they just go for the quick smell.  If you're in a restaurant trying to eat, that is an inconsiderate ass head of a mother smelling your baby's stink ass.  Go to the bathroom.  Take your little yuck to the bathroom and shove your nose up its ass and take a whiff. 
[00:30:00]  Not in front of diners.  People that are eating.  That is disgusting.  And they just think, oh, it's, you know, this is what you do when your parents and everyone's a parent and has a kid, right?  No, we don't.  I don't want to see that.  Ugh.  I agree with you, Anthony.  And I'm sure Jimmy does, too.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  But the way you express.  Yeah.  I understand.  Your displeasure is a little creepy.  You know something?  I go home and I sit at the computer and I listen to the replay of this program. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And there are times I turn and look at the radio and I say out loud, I go, what a lunatic.  And you're talking about yourself.  And I'm talking about myself.  I swear to you.  Just yesterday.  Just yesterday.  I went to my girlfriend and I said, I am just a whining ass.  I don't know, but I was just, I'm like, rah, I'm this idiot, rah.  And I'm just, I'm whining about something.  And I just look at the radio and go, who is this idiot on the radio?  And it was me. 
[00:31:00]  It was me.  You're losing it, dude.  I'm losing my mind.  We are.  We're all losing it, though, because.  I think it's the hours.  I really think the hours have a lot to do with it.  I've been having a lot of discussions about this in recent weeks.  I was talking to Jimmy about it yesterday.  That was one thing we did talk about for a little while on the way home.  Yeah.  This is a very lonely existence.  Oh.  It's really lonely, man.  You do the show and, you know, if we were in our 20s or something, there'd be so much  to do during the day.  Yep. 
[00:31:30]  But everyone you'd want to hang out with has to work.  So you're left most days hanging out by yourself.  Yeah.  There's nothing to do.  Just filling up hours of time.  And I know people are out there going, oh, poor babies.  I understand.  It's a cool lifestyle.  But it's also really strange.  And you have no nightlife.  None whatsoever.  You don't have a nightlife, then.  You say, all right, well, there's nobody to hang out with during the day.  Everyone's working.  You're home alone.  Well, at least you could go out at night.  No, you can't.  I cannot leave.  Well, I just cannot leave the house.  But I cannot go out anywhere after, like, 5.30. 
[00:32:00]  5.30 in the afternoon, I start thinking about bedtime.  It's like, eh, can't really get started on anything.  It's almost bedtime.  It's just weird.  Yeah.  I don't want anyone to feel sorry for us, obviously.  I do.  It's just really weird.  And I think, slowly but surely, we're all just losing it slightly.  We're losing our minds a little bit.  Slightly, yeah.  Like when he just hands me this apple with his hands.  It's like, if you're going to...  Oh, no, who did that? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, if you wash the apple, it should be handed to you with a napkin.  Yeah, how do you think you eat an apple?  What, do you think I'd fucking peel it first with a knife and eat it?  I know.  If somebody brought you a steak, holding the steak in their hand and plopped it down on  the plate, would you eat it or go, what the hell is your problem?  Why is an apple any different?  And I'm not a germaphobe, which is, I don't want to eat it directly.  Neither am I, Jimmy.  I would take the apple and just shine it up on my shirt, and I'd be all set to go.  Shine it up real nice.  Turn it sideways.  That's got to be re-washed now. 
[00:33:00]  I'll do it myself.  Get Mike.  I'll do it.  Oh, look at him running.  I'll just wash my apple.  All right.  No, it's all right.  You're little Mr. Hands all over everything, aren't you?  Is that the one I did you?  Yes, he is.  I'll do it.  I'll watch it.  Little Mr. Hands on everything.  I replaced the knife.  I got a knife in two seconds.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  Curious George.  He just picks everything up with his bare hands.  Ergh!  He looks at it.  Curious George.  Why don't you just carry two apples, one under each armpit, and then just drop them on the 
[00:33:30]  table so you don't inconvenience yourself.  No, you're doing fine.  Thank you very much.  You really are.  Thank you very much.  I'll re-watch it.  These guys are very, very attentive.  Yeah, they are.  Very aggressive.  He's a good boy.  They're working really hard.  They're very nervous when they screw something up.  All right, Tim in Atlanta.  Let's go.  Hey, man.  You said that was John Travolta and Bubble Boy.  You're wrong, dude.  That's Robbie Benson.  Oh, you're right.  It is Robbie Benson.  No, there was Boy in the Plastic Bubble was John Travolta.  Right.  And then there was Bubba. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, it ain't John Travolta.  You just said it again.  Dude, it ain't John Travolta.  He's right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I am right.  Dude, you're an asshead because Boy in the Plastic Bubble is John Travolta.  It's Robbie Benson.  It's Robbie Benson.  Oh, put up, Jimmy.  It's word of Christ.  Boy.  Dude, that movie's from the late 70s.  It's a Robbie Benson.  It was after he did Welcome Back Cotter.  Dummy from the South.  Shut up.  Thank you.  Boy in the Plastic Bubble.  John Travolta playing Todd Lubbitch. 
[00:34:30]  Yuck.  Is there another Bubbles in the Glen?  No.  He's an asshole.  Hey, wasn't Robbie Benson and Kearney?  That's Robbie Robertson.  Robbie Robertson from the band, man.  All right, guys.  For the MyFires out there, we're going to take a break.  Yuck.  A quick break.  Stupid MyFires.  It's great, though.  If you're recording this program, you know, a lot of people are begging us to take more breaks  so they could, you know, break up the segments.  That's all.  How about the MyFires just shut their fucking faces and be happy that they have a MyFire to 
[00:35:00]  listen to?  Enjoy the technology.  I love the MyFires.  I kick MyFires in the stomach.  I love the MyFires out there.  Enjoy the technology, my friend.  Eventually, you know, they'll just be listening to the show whenever they want.  Every single listener out there.  But there's a bunch of them already doing that.  And they're complaining because when we go an hour and a half, you can't really do anything  with that segment on your MyFire.  What do people who listen to live do?  Huh?  What do you think people who listen to live do?  They fucking toughen up and get on with their lives?  We're trying to make it more convenient for everybody.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  This is an on-demand society that we live in.  All right.  When we get back, we'll talk about the Howard Beach racial attack.  Man, this is like, I mean, obviously, we're seeing it a little differently.  Yeah, this is really, this story's going to build.  You're going to see a bunch of activists come out.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're going to, you know, Reverend Al's going to poke his head in this one.  And they're all going to want something.  And the truth of the matter is, this isn't as it appears. 
[00:36:00]  We'll give the details next.  Also, the news teasers.  That's going to be a lot of fun today.  That's going to be the best segment of the day.  And we've got other things.  I just got to figure it out, I guess.  Figure it out, I guess.  Finger.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. life.  I want to give an F.U. to George W. Bush.  You can lick my fucking asshole, you cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Number zero.  Number zero.  Number zero.  Number zero.  Fuck you, guys. 
[00:36:30]  I just want to say fuck you to my neighbor and fuck Cyrus.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to the media.  The shark thing's going way out of proportion.  The great white shark's even endangered.  They're not going to be anywhere.  It's all a bunch of fucking crap.  Fuck you to the shark, people.  More people die from bees.  Fuck you.  I want to say fuck you to Ruth, my realtor, who sold me an apartment with fucking one parking  spot and told me I had two. 
[00:37:00]  Now I come home from work and I can't park my fucking truck and my fucking, I can't park  my shit on the street.  Fuck you.  I'd like to send a big fuck you out to Tom Cruise.  This is coming from one of your former employers who quit because of your stupid Scientology bullshit.  Take the E-meter, stick it, pull your head out of your ass, you jackass.  Yeah, I'm sending a big fuck you out to my well of a boss.  Since she fell down some standards and broke her tailbone, she can't do the one thing she  does best. 
[00:37:30]  Sit on her fat ass.  Fuck you, bitch.  I'd like to give a fuck you to my fucking Chinese, cunt-ass neighbor.  All she does is yell on the fucking phone in Chinese.  Pisses me off.  I want to give a big F-U to the Westboro Baptist Church out of Kansas that came up to Massachusetts  for a funeral for a soldier that was killed in Afghanistan.  F-U holding them signs.  Yeah, this is Ken from Jacksonville, Florida, and this one's going specifically to Jen in  Oxford, Connecticut. 
[00:38:00]  Boys, I hope you play this.  Fuck you, Jen, you lying fucking bitch.  You're a fucking liar, and I hope you fucking die in a car accident, you fucking douchebag.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F-U line at 1-866-FU line 1.  1-866-FU line 1.  Fuck you very much.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting. 
[00:38:30]  I'm waiting for my son.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  It's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Wake up, wake up.  Wake up, wake up.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[00:39:00]  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Let's get right into it.  Big story today in New York City.  Front page of the New York Daily News.  Front page of Newsday, Daily News.  The Post didn't put it on the front page.  Oh, the Post.  Yeah, they're too busy with Brad and Angelina.  Amazing new photos of them.  That's so much more important than this Howard Beach race attack. 
[00:39:30]  Well, they're calling it a race attack.  They're calling it a race attack.  Like, I don't know, this is going to start one of these feeding frenzies of all these activists.  Why don't we start with the news story?  Very good.  Good way.  Makes it easy just to bring everyone aboard, and then we'll get into it here.  Police say three young black men had ventured into Howard Beach to steal a luxury car.  At one point, a man drew even with them in a Cadillac Escalade.  All right, we'll break this down.  All right. 
[00:40:00]  All right, I was on my way home.  I took a shortcut.  All right, so three black guys walking around.  They're looking to steal a car.  In a very, very white neighborhood.  Yeah.  Howard Beach, by the way.  Probably the whitest neighborhood in the New York area, except for that, you know, Greenwich and all that crap.  It's mob area.  It's mob area.  It's a bunch of Italians.  It's a very Italian area.  You see a lot of houses there that are, you know, in any other neighborhood, they'd look like normal houses. 
[00:40:30]  Maybe a split level, something like that.  But they deck them out with marble columns and lions on the lawn and a lot of granite and marble all over the house.  And they build these stone walls around like a compound.  And you see a lot of security cameras on the fences and gates, things like that.  And I'm not talking big houses, just a normal house like you see in the neighborhood.  But instead of a fence, like a little picket fence, you see these walls going up around these houses. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, they're normal houses on the outside.  Yeah.  Wait till you get inside some of these fences.  I'm sure there's shoeboxes full of money in the attic.  Oh, my God.  And it's a very, very Italian mob neighborhood.  A lot of the old, old-time mobsters used to live there.  Gotti was from there, right?  Gotti took care of that neighborhood.  That's where he lives.  Yeah, it was, and it's still the same way.  It really is.  And three black guys walking around, they're looking to steal a car. 
[00:41:30]  They venture into Howard Beach, which is, for a black guy, this is as stupid as a white guy in the middle of the night going into South Central or uptown into Harlem and trying to do something illegal.  Trying to maybe steal a car, a bicycle, sling drugs, anything.  If a white guy goes into one of these neighborhoods, Detroit, somewhere in Detroit, you know, and tries to do something illegal, they are going to get their ass handed to them. 
[00:42:00]  That's just the way it is.  And that's what happened here.  By the way, can I say the media, got to give credit where it stood, the way they mentioned the fact that they were trying to rob cars right in that first sentence.  Thank God, yeah, well.  They didn't milk it.  At least she said that, which is nice to see, at least some kind of honesty is why they were there.  Well, this is being presented as a race crime.  When Bloomberg was talking about it, he never mentioned the fact that they were in there to steal a car. 
[00:42:30]  Of course he didn't.  The police commissioner gets on and starts talking about how this will not be tolerated.  They're playing this up like this guy was in town with the Meals on Wheels or, you know, helping old people.  They're selling goddamn Boy Scout cookies.  Do Boy Scouts sell cookies?  I don't know what they do.  I can't get past those shorts.  It would be the Girl Scouts.  Yeah, Girl Scouts.  Why don't we just play the whole story here?  Yeah.  Police say three young black men had ventured into Howard Beach to steal a luxury car. 
[00:43:00]  At one point, a man drew even with them in a Cadillac Escalade.  There was a stare down and the man drove off.  But 15 minutes later, he returned with two friends and a baseball bat.  22-year-old Glenn Moore and his friends ran, but Moore stumbled.  Uh-oh.  Police say 19-year-old Nicholas Minucci caught Moore on the ground and beat him with the bat, fracturing his skull.  Mr. Minucci has been charged with assault in the first degree as a hate crime that calls for a minimum sentence under the law of eight years. 
[00:43:30]  Police caught Minucci ten hours after the attack, driving the Escalade through the neighborhood.  Inside the car was a metal bat and the sneakers that had been taken from Glenn Moore.  Police say Minucci admits beating Moore, but denies hitting him on the head.  Minucci also gave police the names of the two men with him.  22-year-old Anthony Ench and an associate called Frankie.  He said that Ench shouted racial slurs during the attack. 
[00:44:00]  And that brings back memories of a 1986 attack on three black men by a gang of white Howard Beach teenagers.  So there you have it.  The 1986 attack, I fucking can't tell you how bad I just want to bite these people in the face.  Those black guys in 86 were on their way home from work.  Yep.  They were working guys.  They were just regular guys who were attacked.  That was a racially motivated hate crime.  That was a hate crime.  Right.  These guys were there to steal a car. 
[00:44:30]  Sorry, you're committing a crime in the wrong fucking neighborhood.  Top of shit.  That's what happens.  If you're going to do that, you pay the consequences.  That's the consequence.  That you're going to go into a town that doesn't tolerate that shit.  Just like, like I said before, you go into a black neighborhood and you try to commit a crime there and you get your ass handed to you.  They're not going to cordially call you sir.  They're going to think of every way to call you white motherfucker and beat the shit out of you.  And the media will never report that as a hate crime. 
[00:45:00]  Of course not.  And they'll never serve a mandatory eight years for a hate crime.  If it's the other way around, any time this is reversed, any time it's reversed, where it's white on black crime, it is a hate crime.  It is always labeled a hate crime.  And it's funny how Newsday, that's what Newsday puts.  Meanwhile, their ex-editor is what, trying to jerk off to baby raping videos?  And they can't put that on the front page yesterday?  But they have to put this crap on the front page?  Howard, this is the...  Yeah, why not list his good points?  Yeah, you're right.  Howard, this is the deal in this. 
[00:45:30]  Howard beats a race attack.  Glenn Moore suffered a fractured skull and other injuries, and they show him when he was in his army uniform.  I know, they put him in the, you know, picture of him with his army uniform on.  Black man beaten with bat.  Mayor vows Swiss justice.  Swiss justice.  Yes, they hide all the funds and then don't report it.  They don't give it back to the Jews, even when the war is over.  Justice with plenty of holes in it.  Mayor vows Swiss justice.  Nothing about the fact that these guys were there stealing a car, man.  That's what they were there for. 
[00:46:00]  Tough shit.  Sorry.  You got what you deserved.  And if the fucking guy comes out of the car and, as he was quoted as saying, uh...  What did he say?  Something like, hey, what's up, nigger?  Yeah, because the guy, they'd stare each other down.  Yeah, he said that and started beating the crap out of him.  Obviously, you know, obviously it would be a nice world if you could beat someone's head in  without actually calling his race out.  But that's how it goes when you're caving someone's skull in, whether you're white, black,  Asian, or anything.  I don't think as you're beating somebody up, you're thinking about insulting them with 
[00:46:30]  some racial epithets.  Can I ask somebody, please?  Look, I know I attack liberals all the time and this mentality is not a conservative mentality.  Can somebody, a liberal, please call up and just explain how, on your side of the issue  on this one, you justify this type of a reaction.  Mm-hmm.  Please.  I'll listen.  I won't be an ass.  I would like to hear it.  Maybe there's a valid reason.  Yeah.  But whenever something like this happens, how can you stress the race of the guy who got  beat up when he was there to rob a car? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Too fucking bad.  Too bad.  They just have a really good...  Too bad.  They just have a really good neighborhood watch program.  That's it.  A very robust neighborhood watch.  And can I...  And this is my favorite part right here.  This is this awful...  This woman, who is apparently his mother, I don't know, she's so fat you can't tell  what gender she is.  Uh-huh.  She's like...  She looks like Fred Berry.  Fred Berry!  Yeah.  Now, police identify one of the...  Okay, that was just Frankie.  Now, although Moore, and this is the guy that got beat up, although Moore has a prior arrest 
[00:47:30]  for stealing a car, his mother insists he carried a hammer and other tools with him  because he planned to hang his Air Jordan sneakers on the wall as decorations.  Another delusional mother.  We have lost our fucking minds in society.  He carries tools around to hang his Air Jordans on the wall.  At three o'clock in the morning, whatever time it was.  Yeah.  He's got a prior car stealing conviction.  His friends were there to steal a car.  Yeah.  But he was going to hang his sneakers on the wall as a souvenir, which he should be beaten 
[00:48:00]  with a bat for anyway if he thinks that's a good way to decorate.  If we read a story today about three white guys that went uptown here in New York and  tried to commit a crime and got their ass handed to them, we would be absolutely be  talking about what assholes these guys were to be trying this.  Yep.  Because it's stupid and you're going to get killed.  And that's what happened.  And in this case, I'm saying these three black guys are complete assholes for going to Howard  Beach to try to steal a car because you know what's going to happen to you. 
[00:48:30]  Anybody who's not from that neighborhood.  Right.  If you're in that neighborhood, they're going to notice you.  Look, that's what they do.  They're used to fucking making sure outsiders don't sneak in and creep around and infiltrate.  They call it Little Boston.  This guy, I'm sorry.  He deserved what he got.  He got cracked at a bat.  You shouldn't have been in that neighborhood stealing cars.  Yep.  People don't want to live in that environment.  Tough shit.  And now all these activists are going to come out and they will not even mention the fact 
[00:49:00]  that these three were out to steal a car.  They will not mention that.  It's going to be this poor black guy was beaten because of the color of his skin.  Blah, blah, blah.  Do we have the audio of the mayor?  Because that audio is pretty outrageous, actually.  What he's saying about this whole reality.  How come it wasn't a hate crime that they were going into a white neighborhood to steal  cars?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  The fuck?  Liberals have lost your fucking minds.  You have lost your minds.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Brian and Raleigh. 
[00:49:30]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Brian?  I think you may have answered my question.  I'm just wondering, the way you told it, how did they know that they were there to steal  cars?  Did they have a fucking sign on their head or what did they have with them?  No, apparently the guys fessed up to it to the cops.  They admitted.  Here's what he's saying.  How did the guys with the bats know?  See, they're calling it a hate crime because they didn't catch them stealing a car.  Probably because they were just standing there.  They're not from that neighborhood and they're standing there at three o'clock in the  morning, so you're another up to no good.  Yeah.  What do you do in Howard Beach at three in the morning? 
[00:50:00]  And he said to him, he goes, this is what you get when you try to rob white boys.  Yeah.  And he started beating the crap out of them.  Later on, the guys fessed up to the fact that they were in there to steal a car.  And yeah, if they're in Howard Beach, dude, if you see a white guy in a black neighborhood,  he's there to buy drugs.  You know it.  That's why when they get the shit beaten out of him and the cops come, they go, what  were you doing here?  Oh, I'm visiting a friend.  I'm doing this.  And the cop looks and goes, bullshit.  You're buying drugs. 
[00:50:30]  When you get black guys in Howard Beach at that hour, they're there to commit some type  of crime.  Do I sound racist here?  Perhaps.  Is it the absolute truth?  Yes, it is.  They're not there to do it.  They're not there doing the work of the Lord.  Why is it that people are so afraid to tie race into bad behavior?  The political correctness is revolting.  Nobody minds race being tied in when it's for a positive reason.  Nobody minds celebrating all black accomplishments or all Italian accomplishments. 
[00:51:00]  Nobody minds celebrating all of those and lumping everybody into one pot.  He's Italian.  We're Italian, too.  We feel good.  Yeah.  But if you mention a crime or bad things, whether it's mob by the Italians or this  for black, people get all upset and call you a racist.  Fucking sickening.  And I'm not even talking about just black guys being in Howard Beach like that.  I'm talking about white guys that go to buy drugs uptown.  They absolutely are there to buy drugs.  They're not there visiting friends.  And everyone knows what they're doing.  You could point that out.  You could point that out to people and not be accused of anything. 
[00:51:30]  Say, this white guy, this white guy, he's driving up there to buy drugs.  But the second you go, this black guy, he's absolutely here to steal something.  Well, you can't say that.  Why?  Just like the white guys up there to buy drugs, you absolutely know the black guys down here  to do something.  And how many times, and cops know this, how many times you see white guys riding around  in a black neighborhood, you know what they're doing, and you pull them and go, what the  fuck are you doing around here?  When's the last time in the paper you heard white kids complaining, we're going to stop  because we're white.  You don't hear it because they know they're caught doing something. 
[00:52:00]  I'm in the wrong neighborhood, according to the cop here.  I'm not allowed to drive here.  And I was pulled over just because I'm white in a black neighborhood.  He assumed I was buying drugs.  What were you doing?  Buying drugs?  You're up there buying drugs?  Well, let's go to the fact.  You never hear the outrage from them going, well, they're profiling me because I was white driving  around.  I was pulled over.  All right, let's go to the phones.  They've exploded.  Get some people in here.  Sue in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, Mardi Gras.  Bring up what you guys saw in Mardi Gras.  Absolutely. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that was, those were hate crimes going on.  Right.  That was party revelers.  Those are people that were partying at Mardi Gras, walking down the sidewalk, being punched  in the face by black guys.  We watched this happen.  They let black people walk by, didn't even look at them.  And the second white people walked by, they would grab the girls' tits, grab them between  the legs, and punch the boyfriends in the face.  And this went on and on and on until the cops were alerted to it and broke it up and arrested, 
[00:53:00]  I think, one guy that was there.  And is that guy, do you absolutely think he was charged with a hate crime?  Of course not.  Of course he wasn't.  What was he doing?  He was punching only white people in the face.  That's a hate crime.  You don't see it.  The double standard with this is so infuriating.  Infuriating.  You see it happen every day, and then you've got to look at the front page of the paper and  see race attack.  It's not a race attack.  It's not a race attack.  Should the guy have been more courteous with his language? 
[00:53:30]  Perhaps it would have kept him out of trouble.  Somebody on Instant Feedback said, if he didn't say nigger, the guy would be a hero.  Absolutely.  He chased guys out of his town that was stealing cars.  But because he uses bad language, now it's a hate crime.  That's the insanity of political correctness.  If you are politically correct, I'm going to make a blanket statement.  You're inherently a liar.  You're a fucking, you're an elitist.  You're an intellectual elitist.  You're condescending.  If you're politically correct, you are a fucking, you're a liar.  You're not honest, man. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  All right, we've got some clips from the mayor.  A young man was badly beaten, and it appears that the attack was racially motivated.  You are an ass.  Hate crimes are something that we're not going to let happen in this city.  This is a city that has pulled together and learned its lesson back in 1986.  What you mean is hate crimes that are white people beating up black people?  Won't be tolerated.  Won't be tolerated.  That hate crime. 
[00:54:30]  Not the other way around.  No, that's just a crime.  For some reason, that's just a crime.  Oh, well, it happens.  He robbed them.  That happens.  He beat them up.  Ah, rape.  Ah, that just happens.  It's what they do.  That's the arrogance.  Right.  That's the subtle racism that people who are politically correct have, because it's almost  like, well, it's expected blacks will act that way.  You know, well, that's just what they do.  They're children.  That's what those people are like.  Don't hold them to the same level of accountability.  That's what they say, right.  White people do it.  Well, we're thinking creatures.  Believe me, that's what that underlying shit is. 
[00:55:00]  That's more racist than racist.  Of course.  That is more racist than just being overtly racist.  You always hold the adults to a tougher standard than you do the wayward children.  The children.  So, it's to be expected.  That's what they do.  Just let them do it.  We'll set the example.  We'll punish them when we have to.  Guys, let's go to Boston.  They're always good for a comment.  Alex, representing all of Boston.  Go ahead.  Is it true that the other two guys hid on a front lawn and held a lamp and got away? 
[00:55:30]  That was actually funny.  Why am I not laughing?  Oh, my God.  Because I'm just dumbfounded.  They did hide.  That was actually...  Because they did hide.  That was a really funny joke, by the way, sir.  That was a great one.  Can't laugh at it.  You can always count on Boston.  Let's say hi to Tony in Huntington.  Tony.  Tony, huh?  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, gentlemen?  Hi.  Yeah.  You know, I always have a sense of comfort when some old guinea moves into the neighborhood.  I live in Huntington.  And immediately, they pave over the front lawn because then you know that the neighborhood 
[00:56:00]  is all safe, you know.  And that somebody from Brooklyn or Queens is going to make sure that none of that goes on  and that there's a community watchdog.  That is so goddamn funny.  What is it with Italians that they've got to dig up their front lawns and just pave it over  or put gravel down?  It just cannot be grass on the front lawn.  They leave a little postage stamp of grass somewhere, but the whole thing is paved.  They're driving cars on it.  You know why?  Because when they cut the grass, they wear shoes and black socks and they don't want to  get mulch all over their shoes. 
[00:56:30]  Stupid mooks.  Let's go to Johnny Boy.  Johnny Boy.  Hey.  Go ahead.  Who the frig wants to cut the fucking roll anyhow?  Listen.  Exactly.  I got to tell you something.  This nigga should deserve what he got, okay?  And that whining, you bastard mayor, that son of a bitch, somebody should put a bullet  in his head.  Wow.  All right.  Well, now, now, hold on a second.  We are protecting our own, okay?  See, this is where it gets ugly.  Now, anybody, now, I'm taking it you're from Brooklyn, sir. 
[00:57:00]  What do you think?  Now, why would anyone go into that neighborhood when everyone who lives there thinks like this,  why would anyone go into that neighborhood and try to steal a car at three in the morning?  What are you doing?  Look at this animal we have on the phone.  Exactly.  This guy is going to tell his friends, I called up and I was very diplomatic.  He's a psychopath.  He sounds tolerant, doesn't he?  What tolerance you are to diversity, my friend.  This guy will club a black guy over the head if he's there helping AIDS patients.  And that Jew mayor, he's not Jewish. 
[00:57:30]  He is.  Whatever.  Like, it's a certain neighborhood.  I think it's Third Street.  I don't think I'm breaking any, you know, where the Hells Angels have their headquarters  in New York.  And that is allegedly one of the safest blocks in New York.  Yeah.  Because they don't want any problems outside.  They don't want any scumbags running around.  You're going to screw around outside the Hells Angels?  You're going to walk down Third Street and start fucking around at three o'clock in the morning.  A bunch of bikers are going to come out and smash your face.  Are you going to cry hate crime?  You shouldn't be there causing a problem.  Right.  Because you know, stay off that block if you're going to do something illegal. 
[00:58:00]  We don't live in a utopian society.  We never will.  Well, Howard Beach.  There are just certain things.  Things that are fact.  They're facts of life.  It's the way we live as human beings.  And Howard Beach is a white neighborhood with a lot of Italians there that aren't very  open to diversity.  And when three black guys come in with the only reason to be stealing something, this 
[00:58:30]  is going to happen.  Just like the white guy that goes uptown.  And your example, Ant Ray, the example, it kind of alluded to it.  If I was uptown in Harlem dealing drugs, you said that like off the air.  If I was selling dope on, let's say, 145th and Edgecombe, A, you'd probably get shot for  infringing on their territory.  Exactly.  But how fast would you stand out?  How fast would you get your head kicked in?  You were absolutely, that was a great example.  And do you think, do you think they'd make reference to your race as they're beating you  up?  Yeah.  Of course they would. 
[00:59:00]  Of course they would.  The cops would when they got you.  You're white.  What the fuck are you doing here?  Exactly.  There was an instance a couple of months back.  A bunch of junior high school girls, I guess it was, white girls, went to a playground.  And they were attacked by a group of black girls and beaten up, stomped on their heads.  And the whole time, they were just taunting these white girls, calling them whitey, you  know, just whatever racial epithets you could come up for with for white people.  They just don't have a good term for us.  Yeah.  Honky.  I know. 
[00:59:30]  Nothing really good.  Hard-working motherfucker.  And the cops came and I think even made a couple of arrests.  But until some people really started clamoring, the word hate crime never even got brought  up.  The racial bias never got brought up.  It's just what they do.  Yeah.  That's the attitude of it.  That's the attitude.  Let's go to Ohio.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, there was a...  How are you guys doing this morning?  All right, Chris.  Let's go.  There was a Mexican fella. 
[01:00:00]  He raped a nine-year-old girl and the neighbors burned his house down.  And then they said it was a racial crime.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's nice.  All right.  Let's...  Was he Freddy Krueger?  Not really.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Staten Island.  Charlie.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  This is a race crime just like blue sharks are washing up and attacking people on the  rockaways over there.  Right.  Yeah, hate crime is one of those catchphrases that the media just loves, too. 
[01:00:30]  Well, they know it's going to sell papers.  And the disgrace to mention, I believe it was Michael Griffin was the guy who was chased  to his death.  Was that the name?  Because I know it was Howard Beach.  I don't want to confuse that with Bedzeners.  And this was a guy who was doing nothing wrong, man.  Yeah.  This was a guy who was just going home.  If you attack a guy like that, you deserve to go to prison on a hate crime.  You deserve it.  Those asses were just like, hey, here he comes.  You get out of our neighborhood.  Beat him.  You know.  This guy...  Obviously, look.  The three guys that did this last night...  Was it last night?  Yeah.  Two nights ago. 
[01:01:00]  Whatever it was.  The guys that did this, I'm sure they're not very sensitive, racially sensitive people.  You know, I'm sure there are three mooks from the neighborhood that don't like any black  people in their neighborhood.  I'm sure they are, you know, racist.  But, in this case, these guys were in the wrong place doing the wrong thing.  I'd love to hear...  And they got their asses handed down.  I'd love to hear how...  First of all, they had a stare down.  Again, it wasn't like they just rode by, three black guys!  They had a...  One guy had a stare down with the three of them while he was in his car and they were 
[01:01:30]  standing.  It's like, look, these guys all live a certain life, man.  Yep.  I'm sure the Italian guys, you know, weren't out delivering food either.  I mean, please, you're at three in the morning at whatever time it was.  They know...  People who live a certain mentality recognize each other.  You know, like that thug mentality, whether you're black or Italian, they look at each  other's eyes, they recognize each other.  If somebody sneezes, Aunt and I will look at each other and go, naughty germs, and hide  it at the table.  We recognize it.  Let's go to Alabama.  Dwayne, what's up?  Dude, this is America. 
[01:02:00]  You're innocent until you're proven guilty.  So if they would have saw him steal in the car and put his head through the windshield,  duct taped him, thrown him in the car, set the car on fire, justified.  That's the way we get away with it down here in Alabama.  If you kill someone when they're doing a crime, boom, you're a hero.  But the second you assume that some jerk is going to do something, you cross the line.  I know what you're saying, and that was the argument I think the first guy who Cole was  trying to make.  Like, yeah, they were there doing something, but how did they know that when they attacked 
[01:02:30]  him?  But again, what I'm saying is they had this stare down with each other.  They understand that mentality.  Those black guys understood that they were dealing with some mook from the neighborhood,  and he understood who he was dealing with.  They looked at each other.  They stared at each other.  They knew.  He came back with friends.  He knew they were up to no good.  It wasn't like they were just riding around in the middle of the afternoon.  You understand?  You're right.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the difference.  Hey, also, maybe I'm not getting this point across.  Obviously, what these guys did, I'm not saying it's right what they did.  The proper thing to have done would have been to call the cops, keep an eye on him until 
[01:03:00]  the cops arrest him, and that's it.  That would have been the right thing to do.  What they did, yeah, it was jumping the gun.  It was absolutely, you don't do stuff like that.  You just don't.  If they were committing a crime, you'd call the cops on them.  But what I'm saying is, the way our world works, these are certain people of certain  mentalities, like Jimmy said.  And you're getting the white guys in the Escalade have their thug mentality, and the  three black guys walking through the neighborhood looking to jack a car have their mentality. 
[01:03:30]  When the two get together, you're not going to get this civil discussion.  You're not going to get them calling police because something is amiss.  You're going to get a fight with throwing racial epithets back and forth, and clubbing  people over the head with baseball bats.  That's the world we live in.  Because they're not being politically correct.  They're being honest in a weird way.  It's a bad way, but they're not hiding behind any fucking hyphenated language.  Again, I'm not praising them, but you know what I mean?  Like when black guys and white guys on that mentality of fighting each other, or there's 
[01:04:00]  a problem with them, there's a brutal honesty.  Fuck you, white boy.  Fuck you.  That's what they talk.  That's what they do.  Yeah, and it would be perfectly acceptable if they caught him while he was jacking the  car.  No.  You know, he's stealing the car.  Oh, man, clipped his leg, you know, put his head through the windshield.  That's the difference between Southern hospitality and the way animals do it up in New York.  All right.  The guy, look, man, the guy, they were up there doing something wrong.  If they weren't doing something wrong, he should be charged with assault because the  guy stealing a car, I don't know if it justifies a baseball bat to the head anyway, 
[01:04:30]  so he should definitely be charged with assault with a deadly weapon because he attacked  the guy with an aluminum bat.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't like the guys were committing a violent act in Howard Beach.  I'm not saying that he should have been killed for that, but just the way they spin the  racial angle, it just makes me sick, and it takes away from the fact that a guy did get  the shit beat out of him with a bat.  That's the problem.  The liberals, and yeah, I'm attacking you again.  You say that to say nigger during, or to say spick, or to say Jew during an attack is  worse than to not say it.  So the language means something during a violent attack. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  The language means more than the attack.  Not the jaw being broken, not the bat to the back of the skull.  Right.  The language makes it more prison time.  Yeah.  All right, guys, we've got Eric Logan checking in.  Elo.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi, Eric.  Sitting in the barber chair here.  If you get hit in the head with a bat, it really hurts.  Once again, a good point, Eric.  Thanks for calling out.  Take care, fellas.  He is good.  He just, he brings the conversation to a whole nother level.  Well, I wasn't thinking of that, but he actually does raise a point that if someone hits  you, it's going to hurt. 
[01:05:30]  And it's like, that's what Eric does.  He kind of makes you ponder.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to our pal, Black Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  What's up, brothers?  Hi, Earl.  With the, uh...  Earl, you're from Queens, right?  Yes, I am.  Have you ever been to Howard Beach?  No, I haven't.  Earl is never, he lives in Queens.  He has never been to Howard Beach.  Earl, why wouldn't you go to Howard Beach?  I know better.  Thank you.  There you go.  He knows better.  Are you kidding me?  And Earl, are there black neighborhoods that you could walk through, um, that you know 
[01:06:00]  that I would, if I, if I walk through, say, uh, let's say, uh, Brownsville at three o'clock  in the morning and I'm up there trying to steal a car, am I going to have a fucking problem  with some of the neighborhood residents?  Oh, you're going out and look, you're, you're getting carted away.  Yeah.  If I go to, uh, East New York, Bed-Stuy, uh, Brooklyn, what, what, what's going to happen  to me if I'm just walking around 3.30 in the morning, um, perhaps, uh, looking suspicious?  You will get carted away.  Yep.  You'll be brought into an alley and beaten to death.  Because you stand out in that neighborhood like a sore thumb. 
[01:06:30]  You stand out in the neighborhood.  No, well, and if you, you gave any type of attitude, there's really going to be a problem.  Yeah.  No, it's just, and the other part is, you completely eliminate human, human nature says, if you see  a guy taking your cart, you're going to get angry.  Yeah.  You're going to get very, very angry.  It's amazing how they look at race.  Like, when you're looking, I'm sorry, when you're looking for mafia members, you don't  go hunting Jews or blacks, you go to, to Brooklyn, to Queens, to Staten Island, and you look for 
[01:07:00]  Italians.  When you look, when you say, look, we got to arrest a few Westies, you don't look for,  for, for the gay community, you go and look for the Irish.  You understand?  When you're looking for certain things, you have to look for race as a part of things.  So when you don't live in a certain neighborhood and you're a certain race, you're going to  stand out.  If I stand, if I'm in, in, in, in Brownsville, at least you said, I'm going to stand out like  a sore thumb.  Is that racist?  No, it's just a fact.  So, well, the question I have is, is this, did they tack on the charge of a hate crime  or this is a straight up hate crime?  I don't, I don't know.  There should be an assault with a deadly weapon.  It should be assault, right. 
[01:07:30]  The guy, uh, was speculating at that point that these guys were, were going to rob something,  were going to steal a car.  Obviously they were there to do that, but, you know, he, he doesn't know that 100%, even  though he really does, and, and then he beats him over the head.  Uh, definitely assault, but hate crime, stop it.  No, so it wasn't, it wasn't, they were caught in the act.  Mm-hmm.  See, if they were caught in the act, they got what was coming to them.  Yeah, this wouldn't even be an issue.  Yeah, but the bottom line is somebody looked at, uh, uh, there was a racial decision made, 
[01:08:00]  or people made a judgment on race, which did turn out to be correct, uh, at that, on this  time, and, uh, it's going to be called a hate crime, because they just love it.  Because the language, again, is more important than the act itself.  The act, the, him saying nigger was more important in this story than him caving his head in.  Well, I mean, but I think that's why we need the court of common sense to kick in a little  bit.  The court of common sense.  Earl did not just say the court of common sense. 
[01:08:30]  I believe he did.  I'll check on the replay later on, but I do believe he said the court of common sense.  All right, what does the court of common sense say?  Well, they got what was coming to them.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Earl.  I mean, there's certain language, you know what I mean, there's language in the law.  All right, apparently the court of common sense has left, and now the court of boring has  taken effect.  There you go.  Earl, thank you so much.  Bye, Earl.  Oh, Jesus, is this the guy?  Jesus.  This is...  Nicholas Fat Nicky Minucci. 
[01:09:00]  Why do they keep showing the one picture of the guy in his army uniform?  Yeah.  We know you were in the army.  Good for you when you were there.  That's great you were in the service, but the bottom line is you were in the neighborhood  stealing a car, and you got fucking whacked with a bat.  Sorry.  I do believe the post has a different picture of him in the paper.  Of course they're different.  Yeah.  There he is.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a little more like it.  Boy, this guy...  If you had to pick a white guy that was going to beat a black guy with a bat, this guy... 
[01:09:30]  He looks like Kevin James, and yet he still looks racist.  Yeah.  He's got his New York Yankee cap on.  Oh, he's a problem.  That's like mandatory in Howard Beach.  You have to wear the Yankee cap.  Oh, jeez.  Look at this guy.  Or is it a Mets cap?  Yeah.  Oh, New York, it's a Mets cap.  Wait, wait, is it?  No, it's Yankees.  That's one of those Yankee caps.  One of those black Yankee caps.  It's hard to see in this stuff.  I don't know what happens.  Whenever it comes to sports, I just panic.  All right, why don't we take a quick break?  Hey, huh?  We'll continue down this road. 
[01:10:00]  Also, we got Rich Voss and Bonnie.  They're here.  I wonder who Frankie is.  Was that his name?  An associate.  An associate.  They just identified him as an associate called Frankie.  Frankie.  You know they're just driving around in the SUV.  See them fucking niggas.  What the fuck are they doing in our neighborhood?  Let's go get Frankie.  Let's go.  Frankie, Petey's brother?  No, not...  You know, fucking Frankie.  With the fucking back, get Frankie.  That's all they know. 
[01:10:30]  What's his last name?  Oh, fucking what the fuck is his last name?  I don't know.  What do I...  Fuck the guy.  It's fucking Frankie.  Frankie with an IE.  His associate.  Oh, man.  I was living in Rochester and had no money.  I just got into radio and just out of college.  And one of our friends, he had a house.  He was working for, like, the city.  And it was one of these houses they used for, like, people that needed help, whatever.  It was a huge house, but it was in the ghetto.  So this guy, he's like, hey, you guys want to live for free?  Like, yeah. 
[01:11:00]  You know, when you have no money, of course.  Yeah.  But it's in the ghetto.  Like, I mean, in the ghetto.  We were the only white people in this house.  It was the scariest thing.  The first night, you were scared for your life.  You're just wondering if they're going to break in.  I mean, you get that paranoia in your head.  So we decided to throw, like, a huge keg party.  Yeah.  With the fraternity guys and the sorority girls and everyone from college.  Oh, boy.  And we're like, hey, come on to the ghetto and we're going to have a party.  And it was pretty much all white people in this house.  A couple, you know, black friends of ours, whatever. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  In a really bad black ghetto neighborhood in Rochester.  I've got to remember the town.  And some of the guys were outside and an all-out rumble happens.  Oh, great.  An all-out rumble.  Blacks against whites.  I mean, the real deal, okay?  And we are just getting the shit kicked out of us.  Of course you are.  We are getting destroyed because we're all hammered.  And, you know, they thought it was a good idea just to go outside and smoke cigarettes  and, you know, just be wiseasses because, you know, the fraternity mentality, you know? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  But you're dealing with, like, real guys here.  A real fraternity, okay?  Hard, pipe-hitting niggas.  Not a fake fraternity where it revolves around, you know, drinking beer from a keg.  Marshmallows.  You know, when you're in the ghetto, they have the real fraternities, okay?  You can't compete against that.  So we're getting the ass kicked out of us.  And this guy, Walt, comes running in the house.  And he goes, I will take care of the situation.  Uh-oh.  I mean, the cops aren't even around yet.  I mean, I can't stress how bad this fight was. 
[01:12:30]  People are getting knocked out.  It's just ugly, okay?  You got knocked the fuck out.  So you just brought back a memory.  That's where I'm going with this.  So Walt comes running back into the house.  He goes, I will take care of the situation.  We're like, what the fuck are you going to do?  He goes, I'm going to call Crowbar.  Ah.  Well, when you can dial up Crowbar.  Some guy named Crowbar was going to come and take care of the problem.  You don't get the nickname Crowbar by doing nice things.  To this day, Crowbar never showed up. 
[01:13:00]  And I'm still wondering, who the fuck is this Crowbar guy?  Crowbar was probably busy.  To the point where this guy, Walt, was so confident that one guy named Crowbar was going to take care of this huge race war going on outside our stupid party.  Crowbar.  Crowbar.  I'm calling Crowbar.  That's a great name.  Oh, God.  Maybe he meant I'm calling Tubar because he wanted to get red on the phone.  Red.  Why, you yellow belly? 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to go get it.  I cut Z's in your cheeks.  Did you hear that the one guy, though, that the two guys, when he was getting hit with the bat, came over and yelled, leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  That happened to you.  See?  You ventured into the wrong neighborhood as a kid.  Me and my buddy were walking down to the projects in New Brunswick just because we wanted to be white guys who could do it.  Yeah.  We got maybe 30 feet into New Brunswick, literally.  And walking by a gang of black kids saw us.  They chased us with sticks.  Yeah.  I mean, that was many years ago.  But the bottom line is, we were there. 
[01:14:00]  We knew we shouldn't have been there.  We got chased out.  Yep.  You know, it's the way it is.  Hate crime.  We will not tolerate this in our city.  Shut up.  You will.  Black kids were stealing cars.  That's what they do.  You do on a daily basis.  You tolerate it.  So shut up.  Let's say hi to Dave in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead, Dave.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, I was wondering.  There was one guy, a caller called up there and said he don't mind when a guinea moved in next to him.  Right.  And you didn't hit the bell.  But any time anybody says nigger, you hit the bell. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  There we go.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on, Dave.  That's not my job on the program.  I don't touch the inappropriate bell.  You know why, my friend?  Why is that?  Because the fucking guineas ain't going to come after me.  What?  You know, these guys down here, they were niggers.  Because a black person...  Well, wait a minute.  A black person goes out.  He works.  He works hard.  He takes care of his family.  A nigger, whether it be black, white, yellow, or red, are out there stealing people.  Yeah, we've seen the Chris Rock bit, my friend. 
[01:15:00]  Plus, when's the last time you heard anyone but...  I understand the argument.  I don't buy that argument.  That's not a good argument.  A black guy and a nigger, it's...  Come on.  All right.  Let's go to Tommy in Jersey.  Tommy...  How many white guys get called that?  They never do.  Oh, no.  Go ahead, Tommy.  Your story reminded me of when I was living in Spring Valley, New York.  I don't know if you're familiar with the area.  No.  Well, it gets very dark at night.  Me and my buddies moved up there right after we started college.  We had a big four-keg party.  We were on 13 acres. 
[01:15:30]  One black guy, the whitest black guy you ever met, right?  Starts shooting off about skateboards and my buddy's body shop sucked.  They get through a legitimate fight.  Cops show up.  He's in trouble for a hate crime.  Why?  Because the kid's black.  Not because anybody spewed any racial epitaphs.  It was just that a fight happened between a group of white kids and one black kid.  Tell me where the justice is.  There you go.  You know what I mean?  It just brought back a memory of trying to find Crowbar. 
[01:16:00]  We couldn't get Crowbar to take care of the situation.  Where was Crowbar?  I don't know.  To this day, I don't know.  I don't even know if the guy exists.  I had a friend named Crowbar from Pearl River, New York.  Yeah.  I don't know this Crowbar.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to use him to jimmy things open anymore.  Oh, God.  Which one?  Kevin.  Kevin.  Where am I?  New York.  Oh, okay.  Let's say hi to Kevin in New York.  Kevin?  Hey, boys.  What's going on this morning?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I just wanted to see whether or not those guys woke up here and happy Kwanzaa music. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, wow.  There's a good callback.  That's a good one.  All right.  With that, why don't we take a break and get Rich Voss in here and Bonnie in here.  When we return, the news teases that we got.  You know, if they didn't chase him out of that neighborhood, the neighborhood would have  become some conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel class of neighborhood.  Look at the way that guy barks.  Oh, he just couldn't. 
[01:17:00]  He just barks it out.  He just, he just.  Mong.  He can't hold it in anymore.  And ask him if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the  building part of integration, throughout of which will come a conglomerated, the latter  mongrel class of people.  All of races will be destroyed in such a moment. 
[01:17:30]  I, for one, under God will die before I yield one inch.  That guy's got spunk.  Oh, jeez.  He just explodes, that word mongrel.  And he's an older gentleman.  And if anyone, people keep asking me where that clip is from.  I don't know if we've explained it.  It's from Mississippi Burning.  Yeah.  It's actual Klan footage, and it's just like Gene Hackman, I think, along the floor  watching, like, you know, get the background on the area.  So they use that clip.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  We really should break.  All right.  When we come back, news teases.  Ooh.  That's the beauty of the show.  Love it.  We go serious.  We get goofy.  We get stupid.  We all look at Ben's hog.  It's just a wonderful morning.  That's when we get hot.  All day.  We just go all over the place on this program, because we're trying to still explain this to  the new listeners of the XM Nation.  It's the ONA virus, and as we go to break, the tube bar stuff.  Tube bar.  We mentioned this during that little rant there, so check this out. 
[01:18:30]  Hello?  Hello.  Is Tim there?  Who?  Tim.  I'm not open yet, my friend.  12 o'clock.  We open.  Oh, Christ.  Hello?  Hello.  Is Al there?  Al, uh, Al, what is it?  No.  Cohort.  Al who?  Cohort.  Al, two o'clock.  Al, two o'clock.  Al, two o'clock.  You want to know nobody by that name?  Okay, thank you. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Uh, this is a tube bar?  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder if you could help me.  Uh, I'm looking for Phil Myers.  M-I-Z-A.  Myers?  Phil Myers?  Myers, yeah.  Phil Myers!  Phil Myers!  Phil Myers!  Thank you.  There's nobody by that name.  He's not there?  No.  Okay, thank you. 
[01:19:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Uh, it's just a tube bar in Jersey City.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd like to know if you could tell me if there's an Al Killu there.  Who?  Al Killu.  Al Killu?  Yeah.  Killu.  Right.  What's his name?  Al Killu.  How do you spell it?  I'll be able to announce it already.  Oh, okay.  Uh, K-I-L-L-E-U.  Al Killu.  Al Killu.  Al Killu. 
[01:20:00]  No, nobody by that name.  Oh, uh, listen.  You know, I'm from Clifton.  I'm from Jersey City.  I was supposed to meet a few guys there, you know.  Uh, could you call...  Uh, how about Stanley Payne?  Is Stanley Payne there, you know?  Stanley Schreiber?  Stanley who?  Stanley Payne.  Hello?  Stanley Payne.  What are you trying to kid me now?  No.  What's about you?  You want to hear you kid me around, eh? 
[01:20:30]  What?  Listen, you fucking bum.  You want to kid me, you motherfucker?  I'll come down and kick your fucking mouth up.  Listen, why don't you go out and fuck your mother?  I'll fuck your mother, you stupid son of a...  Why don't you come down here and have a little Nazi and come down and tell me that?  I'll come down and fuck your face.  I'll fuck your face.  I'll fuck your head off.  I'll give you a hundred dollars to buy it.  A hundred dollars?  You won't even get no hundred dollars.  Well, listen, you fucking motherfucker up.  Come over here.  Come over here when I'm getting it.  Come over here.  I'll tell you my age, what I'll do to you. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I'll cut your fucking balls out.  You motherfucker, you rat rat.  Come on, Vic.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 9-1-1. 
[01:21:30]  No, freaks, no.  All right, in studio, our pal, Rich Voss, and his lovely bride-to-be, Bonnie.  How's it going?  You know, Rich Voss, happy birthday. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, thank you.  Oh, happy birthday.  The big 5-0 for Rich Voss.  No, I'm not.  I'm not 5-0.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't believe we're not throwing you a party for your 50th.  No, I'm 48, okay?  My shit looks dope on the DL.  All right, we were at a birthday party the other night.  Opie couldn't say a word.  He couldn't do anything without you there.  He was scared.  Dude, that line bombed when you said it in the room.  You know what?  Don't be bombing on the radio.  Don't be bombing.  Give it a shot, okay? 
[01:22:30]  It stunk when we were all eating steak, and it stinks today as well.  That's right.  I didn't care for that.  It's just not, well.  No, it's not your scene.  We were just animals.  It's not your scene.  Well, it's my scene if you're on the radio.  Jesus, 1968.  I guess I should.  He's hanging out with Joy Behar.  I guess it was a virtual love-in.  I guess I should explain.  Rich Voss invited all of us to his 50th birthday party at that morning.  48th, and it was a groovy party.  Groovy shindig. 
[01:23:00]  And we thought it was a very nice gesture, and what, 30 people showed up, and we were  in a room that fits maybe 15?  Yeah, it was cool.  The room was about the size of the room we're broadcasting in right now.  Dishes bigger.  You think?  And everyone was, you know, piled on top of each other.  Like you're at a Thanksgiving dinner, Anthony, a nice long table, and then a stupid kid's  table for your management.  We put our managers.  Oh, at a different table?  Oh, yeah.  You can't have them.  They're wrecking everything.  There was no AC. 
[01:23:30]  It was brutal.  And then we found out that you had a gift certificate.  Well, no.  Here's the deal.  I had a...  What?  Well, no, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I had a $1,500 gift certificate, right?  From writing...  For the Oscars.  For the Oscars, right?  For the Oscars.  But here's the thing.  It costs almost three grand.  I had to pay the difference.  Dumb Bobby Kelly, of course, doesn't get anything for my birthday.  I don't care.  I don't care.  So, Bonnie...  Did he come limping in?  So, no.  We got you something for your birthday, by the way.  You know what he did?  Well, you know, a $1,500 bill it cost me. 
[01:24:00]  He runs upstairs after Bonnie trashes him and gets me a $50 gift certificate from Morton's.  All right?  50 bucks, you can't even get a side dish at Morton's.  All right?  And he walks down like, you know, oh, here, I had this the whole time.  You jackass.  And I told Bob, instead of giving him 50 bucks, you could have just not eaten and saved him  300.  Really?  Or give me a couple of Jane Cook CDs or something.  Who was the plastic surgeon guy?  That was my friend Susie's ex-boyfriend. 
[01:24:30]  And they're still hanging?  Yeah.  Well, we got ready.  We spent the day in New York shopping for Rich's present.  And I bought him a very nice putter.  Oh, you got him a putter?  Yeah.  That's nice.  What kind?  That all the pros use.  It's a tailor-made Rosa.  It's out now.  Well, now that you're 50, are you using those really long putters because you can't bend  anymore?  Thank you for standing up, prop act.  I made these guys laugh.  Go to the bag. 
[01:25:00]  Gallagher and Anthony show.  Can you use it to smash this piece of fruit?  Very nice.  What kind of putter?  It's a tailor-made.  It's called Rosa.  It's a nice putter.  Very good.  So the plastic surgeon was there with his ex?  Yeah.  So we got ready at his place.  He's got a five-story townhouse.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's loaded.  That's got to go for $300,000, $400,000 easy.  At least, right?  Well, she was bragging it's like $14 million apartment or something. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, it probably is.  Well, the first floor is plastic surgeon's office, and then the second floor is where  he actually does the surgery, and then the top three are his.  Well, he never has to leave, even for work.  That's my dream come true.  Every time you go in, you have to go through the plastic surgery waiting rooms.  Just if he's entertaining, guests, they all have to go through the plastic surgery room.  Yeah.  That is a little weird.  I wonder if he uses it as a write-off, though. 
[01:26:00]  That's technically part of your office.  I mean, how much of that can you write off?  That's pretty brilliant, actually.  Yeah.  First two floors, yeah.  It's almost half of it.  Well, the guy is just injecting collagen in everybody's lips.  He doesn't do collagen.  No?  Or Botox.  No.  Oh, wow.  He'd make a fortune off the old bags that are doing that all the time.  He doesn't do it.  And then halfway through dinner, we find out that he botched one of the surgeries, and it  was on the front page of the Post back in the day, right?  Really?  He put the belly button in the wrong place.  Usually it's right in the center, but when you're a cockeyed surgeon... 
[01:26:30]  He was drunk.  Where did the belly button end up?  I don't know.  I think someone else botched the surgery, and then he went to fix it and botched it more.  But how do you mess up a belly button?  Belly button.  It's pretty simple.  Yeah.  Unless it's Ralphie's, but still.  Snap a line down the middle.  I don't know, but it was on the front page of the Post.  He was also on one of Barbara Walters' early shows for Women Only or something.  Him and his wife were the first, you know, open marriage couple.  Oh, they was not. 
[01:27:00]  I used to do that.  Tell them, Fred.  I was the first one that did that.  He's ripping me off.  That's a bet.  Yeah.  Caligula did that.  I wouldn't say they were the first.  I don't know why.  Yeah, Caligula.  Boss.  They don't get it.  Anyway.  No one gets it.  Boring.  Yeah.  The problem, the guy is like, he's like, I guess, what does he do?  If he doesn't do collagen, what does he do?  Just like breast augmentation?  I don't know.  I don't know as whole.  Why do you want his number?  I tried to guess in the waiting room what people were having done. 
[01:27:30]  That's not a good thing.  That was funny, Rich.  That should have gotten a better laugh.  I know.  Breast augmentation.  Rich goes, what are you thinking of getting some done?  Yes.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  I found it to be hurtful.  You know, Rich, it's a lot harder to build someone up than it is to tear them down.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, it's funny.  He called me yesterday.  He goes, I've got to run downstairs and work out.  He's working out lately.  Are you?  Yeah, every day.  I'm a gym rat.  There must be a hot instructor down there.  No, no.  Is it a nice one? 
[01:28:00]  Is it like your old building?  He's taking his mom's advice, Rich.  I'm replacing something with something else.  That's right.  Dr. Phil said that.  My mom told me.  No, we haven't played that in a while.  We should break that out.  But you're still getting girls, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  I got a hand job yesterday from the Seuss.  All right.  There you go.  So he's not replacing anything.  He's just adding new things on.  Then I went down and pumped a little iron.  So, anyway, the steak dinner was filmed for the Comedy Central show you guys were working on?  Yeah, for the pilot.  And, you know, originally it was just a birthday party I was going to have. 
[01:28:30]  You know, $1,500, let's go have a party.  Next thing you know, it turns into this big thing.  We'll invite this.  We'll film it.  You know, get me all upset over the money.  Her management was going to pay the difference.  You know, it's like $1,300, $1,400.  And what do you call it?  Rich tip, 20% plus $100.  Really?  That's good, right?  Yes, you're right.  You're dead?  Yeah, 20% plus $100.  I took it away from my...  I was going to...  Because I just bought another car.  I was going to give him $100. 
[01:29:00]  But then I said, you know what?  Let me save it.  You gave the actor wannabe a lot of money.  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't one of the actors.  He was kind of a good-looking man.  You know what I mean?  Well, he did not have an easy job with all of your fucked-up friends.  I know.  Patrice ordered...  Attacked him immediately.  As soon as he walked in.  Patrice orders lobster and steak.  Lobster is $23 a pound there.  Yeah.  He got you a nice gift.  He got me nothing.  Patrice didn't get you anything?  You know what?  He should be beaten with a bat.  Nothing.  A nigger. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, my Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Wow, body fat.  Holy shit.  I wasn't even, like, paying attention to the conversation.  I was reading something.  You were reading that race attack, and Howard B.  Just blurted out one of the words out loud.  I got it.  I thought you could say anything.  You can.  Yeah, sure.  You also got to pay the consequences for what you say, but...  Patrice isn't up this early.  It starts raining. 
[01:30:00]  I've never seen a bigger platter of food in front of one human being.  It was the only time the party was fun, because he finally shut up.  I can't...  Anthony, I can't even explain how big this lobster was.  The platter, I can't...  Really?  How do you explain it?  And I had a little petite, like...  Filet mignon.  Filet mignon, and he was laughing at me.  They pulled your steak off someone's lung.  That wasn't even a fucking steak.  It was like three by three, little patch of meat.  What the fuck is that?  It was late. 
[01:30:30]  And what Patrice, you know, ate, it was just amazing.  I can't even explain it.  It was probably like a four-pound lobster to begin with.  It doesn't surprise me.  And then the biggest cut of steak you could get.  Porterhouse.  He had a porterhouse.  Yeah, a porterhouse, but it looked like those porterhouses that you get for two.  Yeah.  That, like, Morton's likes to do.  So, it was a porterhouse for two, probably.  And then at least a four-pound lobster.  At least.  Maybe more.  And I think they were slick, because we never ordered all those...  I see now they're bringing, like, ten dishes or twenty dishes of vegetables.  Vegetables? 
[01:31:00]  You're at Morton's.  What do you care about vegetables?  Nobody wants that.  They want the steak and the lobster.  Steak and potatoes.  I mean, the food is excellent there.  I'm not saying...  I thought it was good food.  Phenomenal.  You know, and that waiter had to put up with a lot of crap, you know.  All right.  A lot of whatever, but it was still...  It was going nowhere.  I mean, there was some good lines there.  I like this.  We were just a bunch of friends chatting about a steak dinner we had, and I thought it was delicious.  Yeah, I thought it was delicious.  Thank you.  No problem.  Where's the other news teases?  Looks good.  The other two. 
[01:31:30]  We were listening to a couple of these news teases in the office.  Of course, we've been going off on the news lately.  I mean, they just...  Their job is to scare the shit out of you during their little teases.  You're watching a show on one of the networks, and they pop in.  Da-da-da-dang, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ah, danger is awaiting you.  Your death, destruction.  And they scare the shit out of you with these teases.  And we've been collecting them.  We've asked the listeners to send some in from their towns since we're national.  And they're just starting that.  Keep sending them in, all right? 
[01:32:00]  There's a link on opianthony.com.  Please do that.  We were goofing on it for a while.  But even us goofing on it doesn't even compare with the reality of it.  The actual teases.  The actual teases are ridiculous.  They are made just to scare you.  It's this whole fear-mongering that the news does.  It's their way to get you to watch, to listen, to say that your children are in danger,  but not say for what.  It's like, tune in at 11.  Find out.  Something in your home right now may kill you. 
[01:32:30]  Tune in at 11.  And you're like, what?  But I gotta move.  I gotta do something.  And since we started talking about this, now when I see these on TV, I just openly laugh.  Because now it's comedy.  Now this is just flat-out comedy.  They try to scare the shit out of you.  So we got a bunch of examples today.  Mostly from the New York area.  Because the New York, you know, our faithful fans from the old days, they get it.  We're trying to get the rest of the country involved here.  So help us out.  Because I want to hear some of the local newscasts with the bad accents and stuff.  That'll be fun, too.  Yeah, the hacks. 
[01:33:00]  But let's play some of these.  It happens when you go to some of these other cities.  You're used to New York news, and we goof on our newscasts this year, but it is New York.  Oh, is this going to happen?  I just got butterflies.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting.  Oh, no.  I'm waiting.  Oh, no.  If he runs up with the sign and...  We might have an assault on the media.  Oh, come on.  Waiting.  Come on.  Where are you?  Where are you?  We should just get in there right now.  Waiting.  Come on, run in.  Push the button.  We might have an assault on the media.  What?  Waiting?  Well, can he at least get in there with the sign?  Can he hold the sign up for something? 
[01:33:30]  Tell him to hold the sign up.  Too much security.  There's no one there.  He could jump that fence.  Did he try, at least?  All right.  We'll get...  He panics.  He is...  Pete panics.  You think?  I know he does.  All right.  Where's the sign?  I don't know.  We'll talk about that in a little bit.  All right.  Here we go.  So, let's get into some of these news teases, Anthony.  Coming up, a controversial report about terrorists and our milk supply.  Terrorists and our milk supply.  Danny, uh... 
[01:34:00]  Oh, he's behind a crowd with the sign.  There he is, holding it up.  There he is.  Oh, you could really see that.  That's cool.  If you're watching this show at the Hubble telescope, you can see the sign.  This asshole.  Can he get closer?  It's Fox News Channel.  He's waving and trying to get everyone's attention.  He should run in and hit that goddamn button.  Quite frankly, no one cares.  Jump up, run in, and hit the goddamn button.  Well, our cartoon, uh...  It's on TV, but no one cares.  Get behind him.  It's so far...  There he goes.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  That's not bad now.  That's not bad now.  Stay there.  Tell him to stay there.  It's perfect.  Tell him to move over to his right a little bit.  There you go.  All right.  We got an assault on the media happening, obviously.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony cartoon figures, and it says spread the virus on Fox News Channel.  We're getting a lot of air time there.  Tell him to stay there.  It's perfect.  Nothing chased away or anything.  What can they do?  Someone's got to chase them away, right?  Jesus.  That's annoying me.  We are just nudges.  Oh, God.  What pests. 
[01:35:00]  Fucking awful nuts.  Well, we love the...  Give us attention.  We need attention.  Wow.  I got to give them credit.  That's a really good one.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Been there for a while.  Now he's getting a little glare, though.  They're doing a very long interview, and there's the Opie and Anthony sign.  They're trying to get it out of the shot.  They did.  Now they're back to this fat bitch in a dunking booth.  Dunking brides.  Could they get those any closer to the...  Yeah, I know.  She was, like, throwing it at like a...  It's a dunk tank, and she's, like, two feet away.  She could reach out and push the thing.  Tell him to get the sign back up. 
[01:35:30]  He's on camera again where he just was.  All right.  Well, we got...  There we go.  Yes.  Tell him yes.  Opie and Anthony spread the virus.  Clear his day on Fox News.  Fox News Channel.  Another assault on the media going down.  That's great.  Good.  We love these.  Good job.  Put the name out there.  We got a hot spot today.  Howard Beach.  He's winning for duration, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely winning for longevity.  There's going to be a lot of news crews in the Howard Beach area today.  Oh, good.  That's true.  With his hair, they won't know what race he is.  That fucking awful, curly, biracial dude. 
[01:36:00]  It's a story about Bridezilla as you're getting...  A lot of your fans are watching this story right now.  Yeah, they're watching this.  Oh, woo.  Ugh, look at these pigs.  Nobody wants to marry those girls.  Even wet, they're not hot.  That's so funny.  They go back to the reporters and the sign just pops up out of nowhere.  It's amazing.  It's like toast coming out of a toaster.  There you go.  Another assault on the media.  Very good.  Very successful on Fox News Channel. 
[01:36:30]  It's cool.  Not all of them have to be exciting, right?  No.  Sometimes you just get a boring one like that.  They do a long interview and you have the Opie and Anthony sign in the background.  Clear as day.  All right, so we're in the middle of news teases.  Yes, news teases.  How they scare the shit out of us.  Let's play the first one again.  Coming up, a controversial report about terrorists and our milk supply.  Ah, why?  Coming up, I need that now.  I want to have some cereal.  Coming up, I got a cup of coffee here.  What am I doing?  I want to drink it. 
[01:37:00]  Terrorists?  Yeah, you got the milk carton in your milk supply.  What?  What?  Terrorist cows are what?  Coming up, my kids are eating cereal for dinner.  Drop the spoon, Junior.  Right.  The fear mongers.  I hate them.  I love when they lose their jobs because of us.  Tomorrow, they're supposed to...  Sorry, get it.  If there's a problem with terrorism in milk, why wouldn't they tell you right there?  Why do you have to wait to hear about that?  Why not just spit it out?  Yeah.  And it's probably a non-story.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't drink the milk. 
[01:37:30]  It's spoiled.  And it's probably bullshit.  Of course.  It isn't even...  Or Bravo Sierra, if I may use the...  Ooh.  All right.  Here we go.  Light curdled milk duck?  Here's another one.  Tomorrow, they're supposed to protect your kids, but are the police in your school district  allowed to carry stun guns or tasers?  And use them against your children?  See what we found on the early show.  See what we found.  Now the image is conjured up of your kid at school with his little apple for his teacher,  carrying his books, and just a cop coming out of nowhere and hitting him with a taser. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  What?  Cops are tasering my kids?  Like that kid who got...  The whole school got surrounded because he had a hoagie or something in his bag.  Oh, those stories pop up.  The kid that would hold a french fry like a gun, and the teacher would pin him down.  What happened to schools, man?  But now you get tasered if you do that.  Yeah, now you get tasered.  Yeah, all the parents are sitting around wondering what dumb thing their kid is going  to get tasered for.  Tasered for.  Oh, we got our tasered audio. 
[01:38:30]  Have you guys heard this yet?  No.  This lady was stopped in, I think, Florida.  Classic.  And she wasn't listening to the cops, and they basically said, look, we're going to taser  you.  She's on the cell phone, not getting out of the vehicle like the cop's ordering her to.  And the cop threatens to taser her.  She doesn't listen, and well...  You haven't heard this?  No.  This is so freaking funny.  How would you like it if you were tasered by a cop?  Well, this happened in Florida for one moment.  I would not.  But police review all the cases where a force is used.  They say this one was justified.  You be the judge. 
[01:39:00]  For speeding, you're doing 51 miles an hour.  The speed limit is on C-cress is 435.  Pointon Beach Police Officer Rich McNevin pulled the driver of this Isuzu over for speeding.  He finds the driver, Victoria Goodwin, also has a broken windshield and a brake light out.  Officer McNevin then learns that Goodwin is driving without a license and returns to arrest her.  I'm going to put your cigarette out to step out of the vehicle for me.  But Goodwin stays in the car, talking on her phone.  Officer McNevin reaches in to pull her out.  He's arresting me.  Stop.  Don't touch me. 
[01:39:30]  The policeman is, you're going to shoot me.  He's got a gun and he's going to shoot me.  Three times, Officer McNevin warns Goodwin that he will use his taser.  Get out of the car or I'm going to tase you.  The next street off the sequence.  The officer hits her with his taser a second time. 
[01:40:00]  Goodwin screams and cries for two more minutes before officers move her to the squad car.  The Palm Beach Post off in Boynton Beach Training Sergeant Sedgwick Aiken to offer a police perspective.  Why use the taser while Goodwin was in the car?  She pulled away from him.  Basically, she escalated the use of force.  Why then was the second taser used while Goodwin was already on the ground? 
[01:40:30]  We haven't patted her down on the one side to see if she has any weapons or anything on her first.  And if you go in and rush her and try to place hands on her, place her on the wrist, she can injure her officer or become injured herself.  Why a fourth, fifth, and sixth time?  Police get tasered as part of their training so they do understand what they are doing to people when they do use their tasers.  That's the first time that black chick had electricity in two years.  Wow.  That was good. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  We got another short clip here.  She's looking at a job application.  I love how they're like, it's not that bad.  Yeah, it's not that bad.  And then I guess this woman's a witness to the whole incident.  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead. 
[01:41:30]  That's the way it works.  That was a late.  I thought the cop was giving the man UPS.  Oh, is that classic.  Going backwards to the assault on the media.  Thad has something on that.  Thad, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Go ahead.  What's up, ONA, little Jimmy?  I think I'm going to have to have UPS.  My heart's going so fast right now.  I'm on the line.  Anyway, I just saw Fox and Friends had a great assault on the media. 
[01:42:00]  And when they came back to the host, he was like, yeah, it's good to see from our pals ONA again.  And they were doing Brad Villa on there, and the guy just kept running into the shot.  I mean, it was good.  It was like a minute, two minutes.  Nothing but ONA spread the virus.  Yeah, we watched it.  But when they went back to the anchor, they mentioned it?  Yeah, he was like, yeah, it's good to see from our pals ONA again.  All right, cool.  Oh, yeah, I'm seeing that on Instagram.  He was in one day.  What's his name?  He was in one day.  Brian.  What? 
[01:42:30]  Brian Killett?  Killmeet or something like that, right?  Yeah.  Was it Chuck Scott, retired U.S. Army colonel?  It was Brian.  He's a really good guy.  Yeah, we like him, man.  He did our show, and we had a lot of fun with him.  We'll have him on again.  All right.  So there you go.  There's the taser.  How funny is that?  That's great.  Uh-oh.  They're communicating.  I don't know what she's saying.  What, without words?  Yeah, Bonnie was doing something, and Voss was trying to listen, and just say it.  No. 
[01:43:00]  You got to go?  You got to go party?  No, you'll know if that's the case.  You have to go to the bathroom?  No, I start partying about five minutes.  You got to go to the bathroom.  Okay, Norton, lift your shirt.  I didn't get it.  I don't get it either.  I didn't either.  What happened?  He's saying that I would like a log on my chest.  Oh, okay.  That was hurtful and accurate.  Who's the guy that likes to get played in?  All right, hold on a second.  We have a valued listener checking in.  Yes, valued listener.  The black chick gets the taser. 
[01:43:30]  The black chick gets the taser.  He's doing the wonderful Paul Anka impression he's doing.  But that valued listener listened to you yesterday.  Yes.  The Paul Anka imitation has to be done twice.  And with force.  And with force.  You got to be dedicated to the bit from beginning to end.  The listener.  Good job.  The listener's still working on their Paul Anka impression.  Paul Anka.  I like that.  Poor girl got zapped like that.  I know.  She said it was so painful she almost dropped the Fay Wray.  Oh, wow. 
[01:44:00]  Jesus.  Here's the audio from Fox and Friends.  I think Brian's got some sports for us.  Brian?  Yes, it was good to see Opie and Anthony again.  All right, 18 minutes before the top of the hour.  Let me just tell you what's coming up in sports.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Good one.  All right.  In case someone couldn't read the sign.  I love it.  Yeah.  We're such past that they finally have to acknowledge us so they can move on.  Mr. Brian's like, all right, all right. 
[01:44:30]  I'll acknowledge you guys.  Yeah, all right.  Good to see those idiots again.  Now go get me the bug spray.  Jesus.  I got to do sports.  All right, we have more teases from all over the country.  That sign is really becoming famous.  I love that sign.  We should just hand out that sign to every listener.  Every listener?  Every single fucking listener.  They need that prop.  That's a good idea to get it out.  Thank you.  I have nothing else to add.  I mean, you can get 40 signs made today. 
[01:45:00]  All right, here we go.  More news teases.  A couple coming in from North Carolina.  Hey.  Coming up next on Eyewitness News, how a Vance County woman says eating fast food helps her  drop some serious pounds.  And what's on your stove could be affecting your health.  Learn what it could be doing to your body.  Joanne, more rain on the way.  Oh, what's on your stove?  What?  They give you AIDS.  And is it going to rain? 
[01:45:30]  I know.  Yeah, they go right from the danger to, yeah, what's that weather about?  Weather could kill you.  But even with the weather, they have to bum you out.  Rain on the way?  And then they go to the weather girl.  No.  Right.  No.  What's on your stove?  Yeah, a pound of bacon can kill you.  Everything.  Yeah.  Wow, what are you telling us?  Alarmist.  A hairstyle leads to murder.  You can't wait to hear what happened on this one.  A hairstyle leads to murder. 
[01:46:00]  It was an afro in Bensonhurst.  Oh, my God.  That is...  A hairstyle leads to murder.  You can't wait to hear what happened on this one.  That sounds like a Columbo episode.  A hairstyle leads to murder.  But all I want to do is look like Jennifer Aniston.  Now everyone with their friends' haircuts are all worried.  I wanted the Rachel.  My Rachel.  Is it my haircut that's going to get me killed? 
[01:46:30]  Jesus.  Oh.  That's hilarious.  With temperatures rising, many of us are opening up doors and windows at night.  That could be an open invitation for criminals.  I actually put an invitation right on the windows.  Yes.  Dear criminals, please RSVP, if you're going to be breaking in and raping me, you are cordially  invited to a robbery rape.  Oh. 
[01:47:00]  I'm not cordially invited to a robbery rape.  Yeah.  We're going to have to give this back to Steve so he makes a nice montage.  Just all of them strung together.  Oh, that'll be funny.  Here's another one.  And is your favorite diner dishing up dangerous food?  Those stories and more at 11.  Alliteration.  Yes, it is.  Dangerous food.  Your favorite diner?  Mm-hmm.  Like, oh, I'm eating my potatoes and there was a 38 in it.  That is dangerous food.  And can funnel cakes from the Jersey Shore have you eating at your own risk? 
[01:47:30]  You're not even safe from funnel cake.  A fucking funnel cake is going to get you.  Just when you thought the funnel cake was okay.  The funnel cake.  And the Jersey Shore doesn't have a bad enough rap?  Sharks and the funnel cakes?  What?  Age needles?  Oh, my God.  Is your grocery store one of the filthiest around?  See what we uncovered at 11.  Unbelievable. 
[01:48:00]  They mean cursive.  Yeah.  All right.  Price check on three.  How much for the fucking Wonder Bread?  What?  This is a filthy store indeed.  People fucking ass sex and produce.  It's like a cucumber up some girl's ass.  Cunt register two, please.  Cunt register two.  This is the filthiest store I've ever been in. 
[01:48:30]  And is your local senior center dishing up dangerous food?  Senior center.  All right.  They love that term, dishing up dangerous food.  Dishing up dangerous food has been used a lot.  And are those popular sports drinks ruining your teeth?  See what we've done with the money.  It's ridiculously funny, man.  Oh, are they the worst?  Ruining your teeth?  Well, I better stop doing anything. 
[01:49:00]  You see these huge muscle guys.  No teeth.  Bad teeth.  Yeah.  Oh, the goddamn sports drink.  Look at me doing a visual gag.  That was good.  Suck it.  And could you be dabbing bacteria on yourself when you hit the makeup counter at 11?  You can't do anything.  Holy shit.  I'm amazed.  This is comedy, right?  Dude, this is not real, is it?  And this is absolutely not saved up over any length of time. 
[01:49:30]  This is just last night.  This shit is one fucking night.  Hold on.  Of the news.  And it's only the New York...  Right.  And it's only the New York area news.  Right.  And mostly the same.  Same channel.  Can you believe this?  Tonight, an investigation you'll see only on CBS 2.  800 doses of illegal flu vaccine.  Unapproved, unrefrigerated, smuggled, and headed to a hospital in our area.  See what Marsha Kramer uncovered.  Tonight, only on CBS 2 News at 11.  I guess I'm getting the flu this winter. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Which hospital?  Which one?  Couldn't you blurt it out?  Yeah.  With the music and everything.  What a bunch of alarmist assheads.  Why is that a cliffhanger?  How about just tell us what hospital?  Save us the time, will you?  Got things to do.  Oh, my God.  Next at 11.  A 911 cell phone call to save your life could end up costing thousands of dollars. 
[01:50:30]  I'm Brandon Rudat in Ansonia.  We'll have a live report coming up next.  Oh.  Well.  Don't call 911.  That's right.  That was the first boring one.  You get a bill for it.  Okay.  You crossed it off the list.  What have you fired, Steve, for that?  Well, no, because I crossed it off because we're going to make a montage,  and that'll wreck the montage later.  Tonight, at 11, do the brand-new Ford Explorers have a serious defect?  Don't miss what we've uncovered. 
[01:51:00]  We're live in Westchester, where fear is spreading.  Will the child abductor strike again?  Bullets fly.  A pregnant woman shot.  You won't believe what the suspects did next.  And Arnold Diaz exposes the shady trick some chimney sweeps use to sweep up your calves.  Not chimney sweeps.  I'm sure a pregnant woman gets shot.  That was all from one newscast.  That was like one break.  You won't believe what they did next.  Won't believe what they did next.  What?  Ran?  Rocked her off at Lamaze while she was bleeding?  What?  Stupid.  I'm glad they're busting apart that whole chimney sweep thing. 
[01:51:30]  How many years were you going to sit there and be fleeced by those guys with a stovepipe hat?  That's the one I'm concerned about.  What are they hiding under that stovepipe hat?  We'll tell you.  What?  Dangerous cell phones.  I'm Logan Burns.  Coming up next, I'll tell you why some people are saying these are exploding and catching fire.  I don't know one person that this happened to.  Don't use your cell phone.  And we know a lot of people.  Exploding cell phones. 
[01:52:00]  They make it sound like this has happened all over the place.  It might have happened once.  That's a fluke.  They love doing this to people.  At 11, it's one of the biggest department stores in the area.  And they may be breaking the law when it comes to safety.  Do you shop here?  Do you shop here?  Breaking the law when it comes to safety.  Mason, Bloomingdale, what is it?  That's great.  I heard about this, though.  The store actually has spikes that shove up through the floor every five minutes.  They're exposing it, though.  It's been secret.  Why are they so vague? 
[01:52:30]  A department store in your area.  Just fucking spit it out.  Because they want to keep everyone involved.  More viewers.  Because the sheep go, ooh, is that near me?  It'll be mine.  I better tune in.  I shop.  I don't like danger, and I shop.  What area?  What is it?  I'm still worried about the milk.  Terrorist milk supply.  Oh, and you're assaulted by these on a daily basis, and you wonder why people are just psychotic,  neurotic messes.  You're pounded in the face with this every day. 
[01:53:00]  Fear, fear, fear.  Fear, don't do this.  Don't do that.  Look out.  Watch out.  This is coming for you.  Ah!  You're running around your house, ripping your hair out of your head, scared shitless.  You hear last night, trying to steal a car in Howard Beach?  See what we uncovered.  Let's go to the hidden danger in baseball bats.  Let's go to...  Awful.  Looks like Jobby.  Jobby?  Jobby.  Jobby.  Jobby from Alabama. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi.  What's up, Jobby?  Hey, man.  We got one down here.  It's a total commercial about a bit that's supposed to air tonight.  I'm going to try to get it and send it in to you.  But it's a woman who got metal shavings in her iced tea.  I saw it last night at 10 o'clock as I'm going to bed, but I have to wait until today at  5 o'clock to find out where I can go to drink iced tea without getting metal shavings in  my throat.  And I had the victim on the TV showing this, like, picture where she had to go to the  doctor to get that piece of metal shavings out of the back of her throat. 
[01:54:00]  She's like, and I had to go to the doctor to get the metal shavings out of the back of  my throat.  We'll tell you tomorrow at 5.  Yeah, try to record that and send it in to us, all right?  I will.  It's hilarious.  I mean, it's just right up your guy's alley of what you're doing about how the media is  trying to scare the hell out of those three.  Let's just hope she's okay.  All right.  Alabama.  They have an update on the Raleigh, North Carolina hair murder, the hairstyle murder thing. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Turns out the kid was shot because he couldn't pay for his cornrows.  It was from a local ABC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Was it a white guy?  So he goes in.  Yeah.  Had to be.  Sure.  And he got shot because he couldn't pay for his hairstyle.  But the news made it like it could have been a hair.  Like it could have been you.  Like look out.  The hairstyle you're wearing.  You're wearing right now could get you killed.  Like somebody's targeting, you know, if it's down there, somebody's targeting mullets.  Be careful.  Like you're actually wearing like a gang hairdo.  Yeah.  You don't know.  Yeah.  Right.  A bandana, a different color shirt or something like that. 
[01:55:00]  Now a hairstyle.  Oh, you think it's just a friend's hairdo.  Yeah.  Could you be a blood and not know it?  Right.  Huh?  A stupid housewife walking around with a Jennifer Aniston.  And then she has no idea that she is now a member of the blood.  Yeah.  Right.  That's pretty funny.  Tonight at 11, is your intern handing you a virus with your morning bagel?  Well, this is going to be an ongoing bit.  So please send more of these in to us from all over the country. 
[01:55:30]  We want to hear from the rest of the country.  Focus mostly on the New York ones.  Yeah.  Thanks to Joe in Connecticut.  He was huge for us.  And a guy named Drew from Durham, North Carolina.  And Whisker Biscuit in Sacramento.  Ooh.  So far, those are the listeners that helped us out on that.  Some people assume that the death and hairstyle thing was someone laughing their ass off at  Eric Logan's hairdo.  But no.  Laughing to death.  All right.  Get Steve to make a nice montage. 
[01:56:00]  Just said that first.  That would be funny.  No, that was a good one.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Hey, did that lady shoot the hell out of the cop that, uh...  The taser?  I'm sure she will.  It just happened, actually, I think a month ago.  I'm sure she will.  It's like a guy with a new toy.  I know.  It's got to be so tempting to use.  Yeah, I mean, it doesn't hurt that bad.  You're just probably like, just tonight, please let something happen where I could use this  toy.  You know, because cops really are psyched about it.  I did ride-alongs with cops, and they just love the fact that perhaps there might be a use 
[01:56:30]  of a taser.  You're staring at a dozing big Kev during this program.  What is the matter with you, Kev?  He is...  He's like...  You do realize you're doing a Terry Schiavo sitting there.  Wait, what's going on?  I can't see him from where I'm at.  He's sleeping.  Like, he'll just like...  He'll fade out.  His eyes will shut, and he'll fall to the side and wake back up.  Boy, that'll help our self-confidence. 
[01:57:00]  That's nice, right?  He's just trying to make everyone laugh, keeping the energy up.  I'm doing a rant.  I'm looking at energetic, perky Bonnie over there, and right to the back, I see Big Kev  dozing off.  Is this boring, Kevin?  Headache.  It's not my headache.  It's not like a Star Trek invention.  Headache makes you go to sleep?  Star Trek, Rich?  Yeah.  Star Trek.  Oh, my God.  Just a word.  You know they were trekking through space? 
[01:57:30]  Yes.  Star Trek-ing.  They were tracking.  Star Trek.  I remember there was always some kid back then saying, Star Trek.  Oh, with the character Dr. Spock.  Yeah, the baby doctor was on board.  Oh, that's right.  Mr. Spock.  All right.  Did you guys watch the Tom Cruise thing with Matt Lauer?  No, but I...  It was hilarious.  Yeah, lunatic.  Tom Cruise losing his mind.  I think he's self-destructing on everything now.  I think someone should put together a kind of rap of all the crazy things he's said over 
[01:58:00]  the last month.  Yeah.  My favorite is he said to that one reporter, put your manners back in.  Ew, did he say that?  Put your manners back in.  It was an Australian reporter, and the reporter goes,  when people come up to you, Tom, and say,  this Scientology is crazy, nutty, what do you say?  And he goes, Peter, no one ever says that to me.  Jesus.  And then he goes, put your manners back in.  Put your manners back in.  I've really had enough of his self-confidence, Tom Cruise. 
[01:58:30]  I'm tired of him.  Time to rip him down.  I think Bonnie should produce the radio show,  because that's exactly what I got in my hand.  What?  The first one came in, the Tom Cruise remix.  Wow.  A guy named Hirsch from Jersey.  It's not bad.  They took some of the crazy audio of Tom Cruise  and put it to music.  So we're going to play that going into break.  When, Hope?  In a few minutes.  I can't wait, Hope.  Oh, gee.  Where's that email?  Don't tease it like that.  It's what the news does.  Should we do this email after the break?  Why don't we do the email after the break, 
[01:59:00]  and we'll get the review of War of the Worlds.  That's why Kevin is here.  Oh.  He wrote up a whole...  Where's your review?  Sweetie?  In front of Bonnie.  In front of Bonnie.  What?  Uh-huh.  He saw the movie, and he writes up this whole thing.  Look at this thing.  Wow.  I haven't written that much in eight years.  It's going to be his turn to watch us fall asleep as he reads that.  I think it'll be interesting.  Oh, dude, yes.  Blonde locks.  We're going to make Big Kev read this.  Instead of just talking about it openly on the air,  you have to read this.  I've never seen a smaller font in my life. 
[01:59:30]  I know.  Wow.  This is...  You know, when you start reading something like this on one page,  your brain just, like, short circuits.  It just goes, I can't do this.  He's so small.  It looks like Braille.  Yeah, there's no spacing.  It looks like Braille.  That's not...  That was...  You're on fire today.  One bad one, and you fucking take the headphones off?  Yeah, come on.  Have a little stick-to-itiveness, sweetie.  Stick-to-itiveness.  Put your hands back on.  So small, it looks like Grail.  And there's a guy who sent us an email. 
[02:00:00]  He's claiming he knows exactly what the Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes thing is about.  Really?  This is the type of thing that will get someone sued for millions of dollars.  Oh, yeah?  So we've got to be very careful.  We've got to be careful.  Why are you reading an email that someone said?  It's an opinion.  Somebody's speculating.  I know.  Punk.  As long as we make it perfectly clear that this guy is speculating.  Complete speculation.  He seems to be in the know in Hollywood.  Katie Holmes better be careful. 
[02:00:30]  And where...  Oh, this thing is starting to...  It's online everywhere.  It's online everywhere now.  Katie Holmes fixes her wagon to Tom Cruise right when he self-destructs.  Great move.  Won't matter, though.  Look what it did for Nicole Kidman, who was very talented, but I mean, you know...  Yeah, but he wasn't self-destructing like this at that point.  He had his old publicist.  Yeah.  That's right.  His new publicist.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, go out there, Tom, and just, like, speak your mind.  That's what people want to see.  That's my new idea for you.  Well, it's not self-destructing, though. 
[02:01:00]  The movie is mediocre at best, right, Kev?  Is that what you're going to say?  Not even mediocre at best?  Oh, wow.  He's saying...  No, no, no.  Don't tell, because that's the tease.  Oh, okay.  Did you see a movie that might not be good?  Oh.  If this movie was like five stars or something, you'd barely see Tom Cruise.  You wouldn't have to do all this stuff.  Yeah.  But we'll read the email after the break.  It's pretty wild.  Could movies make you disappointed?  Why is Orson Welles rolling over in his grave?  Which lead singer did Tom Cruise have a fling with? 
[02:01:30]  Uh-oh.  That's what we're getting at after the break.  But first, here's the Tom Cruise remix.  All right.  From Hirsch in Jersey.  You don't know much about history.  You don't know the history.  You don't know much of my own.  There is no such thing as a chemical imbalance.  You don't know much about a science book.  Pseudo-science.  You don't know much about the franchise.  Now you're talking about two different things.  But I do know that I love you. 
[02:02:00]  I really care about you.  And I know that if you love me too, you don't know a brave new world.  Don't know much about geography.  You don't know I do.  Don't know much of trigonometry.  I don't talk about things that I don't understand.  You don't know much about how to grow.  I'm not so sure about that.  You don't know what a slight rule is for.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know what it wants to do.  You're not getting to the reason why.  And if this one could be with you. 
[02:02:30]  That's not what I'm saying.  What a wonderful world this would be.  A brave new world.  Now I don't claim to be an ace to be.  You should be a little bit more responsible.  I'm trying to be.  Here's the problem.  For maybe by being an ace to be, baby, I can win your love for me.  I want to see her do well.  Don't know much about history.  She doesn't understand the history.  Don't know much of why all of us.  You don't understand it.  Don't know much about a science rule. 
[02:03:00]  You don't know, and I do.  Don't know much about the phrase I took.  And I'm passionate about learning.  Well, I do know that I love you.  I'm not psychotic.  And I know that if you love me too,  For the wonderful world this would be.  A brave new world.  Like sand through the hourglass,  so is the ONA virus.  We got human waste.  We're at that really crazy store before we go break.  Here we go.  Thank you, Eric.  Ooh.  Looks like somebody has rebounded from that UPN debacle. 
[02:03:30]  Eric does a great job every day.  He really does.  Oh, well, hold on.  Young Timothy Hutton Harris pointing.  What happened, Derek?  Boy, Derek, I've never seen that young strapping buck jump up so fast.  That idea came from in here, just to let you know.  What idea?  About seconding into that next story.  All right.  So I apologize.  Eric?  Wow.  And they're all laughing.  No, but I gave you credit.  I thought you rebounded from a UPN failure.  But you wasn't going to interrupt and say,  Oh, yeah, Derek pointed that out while you were talking. 
[02:04:00]  In fairness to stupid, he didn't interrupt.  There's a whole competition going on behind the scenes.  Oh, and it's fantastic.  Just the way a fucking young lawyer from a Grisham novel jumped up.  That way from this fucking part of the room.  That was from this part of the organization.  We secretly hate that guy in there.  There's just different worlds on either side of that glass, man.  Oh, boy.  They really... 
[02:04:30]  Oh, boy.  Look at it.  They are rolling in there.  What happened?  You plugged your iPod into the computer?  Eric, what just happened?  Wow, you're panicking.  Oh, he is panicking.  I wasn't even touching it until I just started playing stuff.  No, stop it.  I swear, the gas...  I hit the brake and the car lunged ahead.  How did it happen?  I killed 50 people on a pier.  Why was I driving on a pier?  I wasn't.  The car went flipped. 
[02:05:00]  And the gas pedal...  I hit the brake and the gas went...  Eric, you hit something.  Yes, you did.  Eric, fess up.  You hit something.  What is it, thinking for yourself?  How to play tic-tac-toe so we'll learn.  Shut up, stupid.  You panicked.  Hello.  So let's...  I'll play what I want, Eric.  I'll just play whatever I want.  Don't turn me off, Eric. 
[02:05:30]  Wow, Hawk.  That was a panic of cataclysmic proportions.  What was the song they're playing?  That's the type of panic that in the army kills people.  That's a friendly fire panic.  Or in NASA, it blows a ship up.  Here, you just get your ears blown out a little bit.  And a room full of laughter on the other side of the glass.  It looks like a zoo back there.  Like, they're all caged in glass.  And the name of that display is really happy white guys.  Yep.  Oh, are they happy? 
[02:06:00]  Please, it's punch.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Having more of anything is always more gooder, right?  Huh?  More money, more gooder.  Oh, yes.  More sleep, more gooder.  Stool samples for everyone.  Dude, what happened?  That's not more gooder.  More Opie and Anthony, definitely more gooder.  Very nice.  July 4th and 5th, get ready for an extra two hours of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Beginning at 7 a.m. Eastern Time and replaying every six hours. 
[02:06:30]  It's a special, longer, worst of Opie and Anthony.  So be it, fret no more.  Lift the kill of pieces to prepare for more.  So be it, settle the score.  Trust me again for the words that you will hear evermore.  Ah.  I've got to pull out the Metallica CDs for the vehicle again. 
[02:07:00]  Of course you do.  God damn Metallica rocks.  Phenomenal.  Really?  Sometimes, though, when we're talking, if the music comes out really loud, I get scared.  You get scared.  All right, where are we going?  By the way, I just found some great CDs, some audio CDs I made up, and one of them has,  you hear that song, Melanie?  I got a brand new pair of roller skates.  Yes, I remember that one.  I was blasting that one in my car last night.  Are you insane?  Do you enjoy that song? 
[02:07:30]  Are you messing with us?  I don't know.  No.  Why do you like that?  Is this going to be the cash?  I got a brand new...  You like that?  You got a brand new key.  You know, Jimmy turned me on to Johnny Cash, though.  Yeah?  Everyone knew Johnny Cash, obviously, but driving around Jimmy when he was doing spots, well,  he still doesn't, but I would go with him to do spots all over the city.  He had an amazing Johnny Cash collection.  And the deeper you get into his music, oh my God, unbelievable.  But the rest of your tastes stink. 
[02:08:00]  I have some very good musical taste.  Oh?  I have some...  Melanie?  Yeah, so I have.  Good tune.  That is the faggiest song ever.  It really is.  There's nothing enjoyable about it.  It's annoying.  It's just...  It's annoying to the ear.  I like it.  Anthony, it's so bad our master computer doesn't even have that song.  Master computer?  No, because I heard it on XM the other day.  I remember slamming the button to get off of the 60s channel.  I got a brand new pair of roller skates by Melanie.  You got a brand new key. 
[02:08:30]  It's on there.  Are you sure it's Melanie?  Yeah.  Yes.  Neil Diamond.  You like Neil Diamond?  I like him, right?  Some on the rocks.  Yeah, Neil Diamond.  In America.  There you go.  A little Eternal Flame, maybe, by the Bangles.  Very lovely song.  Old music.  Remember, we used to listen to old music.  Yeah.  Before we make out.  All right.  Let's see.  I rode my bicycle past your window last night.  Huh?  I roller skated to your door at daylight. 
[02:09:00]  No, man.  It almost seems like you're avoiding me.  I'm okay alone, but you've got something I need.  Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates.  Oh, God.  I think that we should get together and try the more to see.  Oh, God.  I've been looking around a while.  You got something for me. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, man.  You've got a brand new pair of roller skates.  You've got a brand new team.  Oh, that's three-team voice.  Okay, terrific.  I ride my bike.  That is horrible.  Did you put your sister's clothes on as a kid to sing that in front of the mirror?  Did you put on your sister's little dress, run around the house?  There is nothing enjoyable about that song.  There certainly is.  Like, some guilty pleasures have an interesting hook, a good harmony that you enjoy. 
[02:10:00]  Musically, it's good.  That one is just awful.  I love it.  Hold on a minute, though, Anthony.  Anthony, Hodge in North Carolina has a little inside info about that song.  Attaboy, Hodge.  Thanks for the call.  Let's go, Hodge.  You're welcome.  Oh, and A.  Hello, Angel.  Welcome to the program.  And happy 50th there, Rich.  Thank you.  I just wanted to say, my wife likes that song with the roller skates by Melanie.  And I thought it was kind of a gay song myself.  And she says, you know, she's talking about having sex with this guy.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, I mean, when you listen to it, I was like, holy cow, I never realized  that.  Maybe that's the reason why Jimmy likes it. 
[02:10:30]  And I got to agree, everybody's got to love Neil Diamond.  He's the Jewish Elvis.  Wait, who has the key in this song, though?  The guy?  I got a brand new pair of roller skates.  You got a brand new key.  So, all right.  The guy who has the key, because back in the day, those roller skates, you know, you'd stick  the key into it, like adjust them.  I understand the guy's going to stick his penis into her.  It could be that, though, or it could just be an odd symbol of love.  You know, we connect and make each other whole.  Whatever it is, it's lovely.  I got a mailbox, you got a letter.  It's not sex. 
[02:11:00]  It's a horrible song.  Wouldn't you be the letter, and she would be the mailbox, though, Rich?  Whatever.  It would just be two letters.  But she's got a strap on, and she's fucking you in the ass.  Way to wreck the bit there, subtle slip-up.  You got a brand new dildo.  I got a brand new dog door.  What?  Someone wants to correct Voss on something else.  Paul in Ohio.  Go ahead, Paul.  Hey, O'Bans.  Hey, Cupcake.  How you doing?  I want to tell you, Rich Voss, is he still in there? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you muttering, stuttering prick, it wasn't Orson Welles, it was H.G. Wells.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  I was going to correct you.  Oh, it was?  But no, didn't Orson Welles do it on the...  Oh, yeah, he did it on the radio.  Orson Welles did it on the radio.  Yeah, Voss is wrong, but I can understand how it happened.  It was off camera when he said, I meant to say David Welles.  That was the problem.  No, Orson Welles.  David Welles.  Turning over in his grave.  And why did I just say off camera?  Yeah, and it was Orson Welles who did War of the Worlds on the radio.  Well, you got to give that one to Voss. 
[02:12:00]  Yes.  You know, I just realized that it was H.G. Wells and Orson Welles involved with the War  of the Worlds.  Don't do it on Welles is rolling over in our grave.  We knew it, Richman.  I know a lot about stuff back in that era.  I'll say you do.  Before we get on to the Tom Cruise thing, let's say hi to Frank.  Wait, this is the Frank?  Frank?  Kermit Frank?  Hey, Frank.  Frank.  Frank Rizzo.  Open your fucking ears, jackass.  Hey, are you there? 
[02:12:30]  Mister?  No.  Going once.  Hello?  It's mine, Frank.  Going twice.  Are you there, Frank?  Frank.  It says you guys convinced me to divorce my wife.  There's a story there, but...  Oh, Joel S.  That is true that the only time I want to hear that song is watching Roller Girl in Boogie  Nights.  You're rolling around to that song.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  The song just went up a notch.  Of course it did.  In my book.  Not for what it sounds like, but for the visual reference I got.  Now it's almost cool. 
[02:13:00]  Now it's almost cool.  I got a brand new.  It's lovely.  I love her voice.  How hot was she in that movie?  Real hot?  Yeah.  Real hot, I would say.  What broad?  What broad?  Yeah, Boogie Nights?  Yeah, Boogie Nights.  Roller Girl.  Remember her?  What's her name?  I know who she is.  She's Heather Graham.  Heather Graham.  She's lovely.  Yes.  Her breakout role, right?  All right.  You want the letter, or you want Big Kev's War of the Worlds review?  I think we should start with the War of the Worlds review.  That's just an opinion.  All right. 
[02:13:30]  Unless you have a good letter.  Someone's going to have to give up a mic so Kevin can read his review of War of the Worlds.  We don't have an extra mic?  No.  What happened?  No, we don't.  Yeah, why can't we get another mic in here?  Oh, send the board.  It's got to be bigger or something.  Can't we just...  Go sit on Voss's lap for just a little bit.  Well, you know, it looks like the control panel on Star Trek.  Yeah.  Bonnie, you go sit...  Where are you going, Bonnie?  No, no, no.  You're doing...  No, sit on Rich's lap.  Yeah, sit on his lap.  Can we get Bonnie a chair or something?  Hawk, how about a chair for Bonnie, please? 
[02:14:00]  She doesn't have to stand.  Hi, Katie.  You think I would get up?  Yeah, no shit.  Boss, you really are a creep.  How about letting your fiancée sit?  Oh, my God, Rich.  Jesus, Rich.  Oh, he is standing.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You are nasty.  I get a funny in every once in a while.  Don't be that shy.  That was funny, though.  Rich, that was you?  Oh, my God.  You were funny?  You just go, I get a funny once in a while.  I get a funny once in a while.  I'm funny, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, very funny.  How does it feel to be sitting next to your fiancée and your ex?  Jesus.  Yeah, you two had quite the little relationship.  Oh.  We'll go over the phone.  All right.  Hi, Kev.  Big Kev is here with his War of the Worlds review.  He called everyone.  He had to come in today to give his War of the Worlds review.  Now, don't be frightened if his review isn't that sparkling and you want this to be a good movie.  Because he's had a few bad reviews in his day.  Yes.  I've given him bad reviews on his reviews. 
[02:15:00]  That's true.  He was the one that recommended, and he'll never live this down.  He actually recommended to me that I watch Moulin Rouge.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  I watched it.  I wanted to punch the television.  It was the worst movie I've ever seen.  Gotcha.  Ever, ever, ever.  Did you tell it to him, or did you just write it down because there was a cock in your mouth?  Yeah.  I thought that was a pretty good movie.  Moulin Rouge.  Are you going to be talking to the uber geeks in this review, or are you going to talk to normal people? 
[02:15:30]  Normal people.  Yeah.  I read some of the sentences there.  Did you?  Did you?  You understood all the words?  I understood, yeah, but I don't, you know.  You like to talk to geeks.  That's your thing.  All right.  Thrill Ride Dangers on CNN.  I just saw they showed a roller coaster in the little caption.  It was Thrill Ride Dangers.  You might want to get that.  All right.  Good work, Hawk.  Chop, chop.  That's our new thing.  News teases.  Keep them coming.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  Go ahead, Big Kev.  H.T. Wells penned his novel War of the Worlds in 1898.  And this review is now real time from then.  Go.  This way, you actually wrote this.  I did.  And you decided to write penned?  Penned.  Penned.  He took his quill out of the ink and started writing in cursive.  Penned.  All right.  I got through half the first time.  In a cursive hand.  Well, who says that in normal language?  Kev?  107 years ago.  Just continue.  He penned it. 
[02:16:30]  And there is no question that Wells is considered one of, if not the grandfather of science fiction  writing.  His novels, The Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and The Invisible Man are familiar  to most people, even though each is over 100 years old.  Amongst the recognizable incarnations of Wells stories are Orson Welles' radio prank that  you guys discussed.  I did that first, Robin.  Ripping me off.  As well as a litany of films, which have been made since film began, actually. 
[02:17:00]  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  Wait, wait.  How many films?  A litany.  A litany.  How many films differentiates a bevy from a litany?  Several.  It's a litany a test.  A litany a test.  Yes.  Wasn't he involved in Watergate?  C. Gordon litany.  Oh, litany.  I hate litany.  In the past decade alone...  I broke my litany, man! 
[02:17:30]  Get on your litany like a dog!  All right, continue.  In the past decade alone, the three books that I mentioned have been made into films and  by and large have been considered failures.  The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Time Machine, and The Invisible Man.  And Steven Spielberg's latest reimagining of War of the Worlds is no exception.  Oh.  Ooh.  Look, I'm not saying this film isn't going to make a ton of money, and if that's all 
[02:18:00]  the qualification you need to decide if a film is good, then your decision was made  long ago when Spielberg announced it and Cruise signed the contract.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Can you please continue with this riveting review?  It is very, really slow.  I know.  It has all the elements to back that theory up, too.  Spielberg is one of the most successful directors of blockbusters, although his last four films  have been less than spectacular in either content or box office. 
[02:18:30]  Tom Cruise is box office gold, but his insane behavior of late on the press junket for Worlds  is making him more of a sideshow draw than a great actor.  I guess there's something about watching a Scientologist battle aliens that is ironically funny and entertaining.  Quiet.  The reported big budget, said to be over $100 million, but rumored to be well over $200 million.  Ooh.  Which is the truth?  I believe it's probably close to three, would be my guess.  Wow.  $300 million. 
[02:19:00]  It's got to be close.  He just added both estimates.  All right.  The special effects extravaganza is also a big draw, but so was the special effects of  films like Independence Day and Twister and Armageddon, just to name a few.  If you're looking for substance over flash, you aren't going to find it here.  In this review.  Thank you, Eric.  There you go.  Sip some water.  Draw it out. 
[02:19:30]  You keep turning to the side and coughing like you're doing a big press.  Excuse me.  A little quiet.  The story is typical.  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Sorry, Kev.  They can come out of nowhere.  Thank God.  Chris in West Virginia.  Chris?  Hey.  What's up, Bo?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  I have a midget spot for you.  All right.  Uh, I saw one, uh, I was, it was late at night last night, about 2 a.m. 
[02:20:00]  I was driving down the strip in, uh, one of our towns here, and, uh, one was driving,  he was riding a bike.  He had a black vest on, a cowboy hat, and, uh, leather chaps.  Really?  I was riding a full-size bicycle, yes.  I thought I was tripping out.  A little midget?  Yes.  With a cowboy hat.  Are you sure it wasn't JonBenet Ramsey? 
[02:20:30]  He had duct tape on his chaps.  He had this, like, Abraham Lincoln beard.  Wow.  So, yeah, it was, uh, yeah, pretty freaky.  I thought, you know, something was going on.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right.  Great to see you.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  All right, Big Kev.  One World's Review, yes.  If you are looking for substance over flash, you aren't going to find it here.  The story is typical, all too familiar, and about as close to Wells' book as Private Parts was close to the truth. 
[02:21:00]  Oh.  Ooh.  Oh, hey.  Getting a little political there.  Oh, a little poke at Howard Stern there, huh?  Whoa.  Cruz's Ray Ferrier is the divorced, blue-collar New Jersey, dock-working, yet brilliant auto mechanic, irresponsible dad,  whose weekend with his typical, angry, rebellious teen son, Robbie, and his all-too-witty ten-year-old daughter, Rachel, 
[02:21:30]  played by Dakota Fanning, is interrupted by an alien invasion.  And what drives the story, apparently, is in order to get Rachel to stop screaming,  I want my mommy, it is necessary to return her to her pregnant-by-the-new-boyfriend mother,  who's visiting her parents in Boston.  Of course, the alien invasion has left all the electronic-  We interrupt this program.  Oh.  Ozone midget sighting of the day.  A circus in town? 
[02:22:00]  Ah, Bill.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just passed the highway workers working out on 81, just outside of Syracuse.  There was a DOT state employee, a midget, on a steamroller.  He had, like, this little, sitting on, like, a milk crate with pegs or something,  blocks on the wheels, on the pedals, so he could reach the pedals to continue working the steamroller.  Are you kidding?  A midget on a steamroller.  And you know if somebody threw him under and then just ran him over, they'd call the ambulance,  but they'd all have a little laugh at first? 
[02:22:30]  Of course.  Oh, God.  A little crushed fella.  You're doing a hell of a job.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  They'd all get out of a little car with a stretcher, put the steamroller on the stretcher,  and walk away with it.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  The alien invasion has left all the electronic equipment useless.  Thankfully, Cruz's character-  Unfortunately, microphones still work.  Thankfully, Cruz's character, Ray, is genius with engines and allows them to activate a working 
[02:23:00]  vehicle with which they are able to traverse north on a highway littered with disabled cars.  Traverse.  Luckily, despite the fact that all cars cease to work during afternoon rush hour, a convenient  path through them is found.  And this is an example of the movie's number one problem.  It's all too convenient.  There are scenes so contrived, it's almost jarring.  Virtually nothing goes badly for Cruz and company.  Even the one precious time you think there will be a setback, which, had it worked out,  might have redeemed the movie to a small extent. 
[02:23:30]  It is utterly and grossly solved at the film's end.  And before any of you start in with that suspend-your-disbelief crap, let me cut you off.  Oh, hey!  I like a fella-  Oh, exactly!  I have no problem suspending my disbelief.  Yeah, right?  I have no problem-  Poor you guys call me a bore, let me say.  We have a Jim's quick review, though.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  All right.  I've got to interrupt again, Anthony. 
[02:24:00]  A valued listener checking in, and we've got to get right to the valued listeners when  they call the program.  Good point.  Yes, valued listener.  Yes, like the caller yesterday, I, too, like toast.  All right.  Thank you, valued listener.  Another listener that enjoys toast, Opie.  And I think Jay in Pennsylvania has a news tease.  Is that true, Jay?  Yeah.  In a big test, a review, cause you commit suicide.  Punch it out.  Almost.  Almost.  Boy, what an awful delivery that was.  It was a good- 
[02:24:30]  The concept was fine, though.  I liked it.  Have some confidence, sir.  Package got there all beat up, taped up.  Yeah, Big Kev's reviewer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, review suicide.  Maybe commit suicide.  Go ahead, Big Kev.  I have no problem suspending my disbelief, but I will not retire it, especially for a film  that is supposed to be happening in the here and now, as opposed to long ago in a galaxy  far, far away.  You'll suspend it, but not retire it.  Yes.  Interesting.  You're suspended.  You can suspend all the disbelief you want.  You can suspend all the disbelief you want, but it won't save you from the film's fountain 
[02:25:00]  of alien invasion and special effect cliches, the film's second biggest problem.  The film's second biggest problem.  There's nothing new here at all.  Oh.  The ozone midget sighting every day. 
[02:25:30]  I think there were this many midgets left on Earth.  Paul in Texas.  Go ahead, Paul.  Yeah, there's a construction yard down here, a wood yard like a small type of Home Depot,  and there's a midget guy down here that owns his own construction company.  Short little dude, always coming in dirty, and he's coming around parking orders to all  his tall Mexican friends and all his tall Mexican employees telling him, you know, what lumber  to load on and everything, but he's a short little Mexican dude, and he runs his own  daggum midget construction company.  What, they built dollhouses? 
[02:26:00]  Working out.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  A scene involving the creepy guy who seems to know everything, played by Tim Robbins, involves  the characters avoiding an alien tentacle a la the Abyss.  Another scene was hundreds...  Whoa, Allah.  Allah.  Allah.  Okay.  Another was hundreds of people dumped into the icy waters of the North Hudson. 
[02:26:30]  With shots and effects lifted almost directly from Titanic.  Even the look...  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Tell them, Fred.  Even the look of the aliens is alarmingly close to the ones in Independence Day.  Right.  All of this trite rehashing and overt exposition leads us to the end of the movie, which is  so abrupt, anticlimactic, and unexplained, it takes Academy Award winning voiceover specialist  Morgan Freeman to explain...  Well, no shit.  ...to explain it, sorta.  In conclusion... 
[02:27:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  In summation...  In conclusion, it is not a good movie.  It is an event movie.  A would-be blockbuster without a shred of new idea, effect, or anything else which separates  it from other films in the mindless summer blockbuster category.  The type of film that people like to sit in...  Sorry.  The type of film that people like to sit in and call their friends on their cell phones  and say that they are there.  The type that the same type of person will say,  Dag, boy, I dag should have busted that alien motherfucker. 
[02:27:30]  Whoa.  To the people around them.  What?  If you're going to see it...  Oh, exactly.  If you're going to see it, consider yourself warned.  Could you do that character again?  No, Jim.  Please?  No.  That was riveting.  That was cool.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  So, should people go see it?  No.  For God's...  Love of God, no.  Your new nickname is Big Melatonin.  Thank you.  Wow. 
[02:28:00]  Cricket.  I don't even know if we can regroup.  I think we should all just go home.  Can I hear it again?  You need to hear it again?  Hawk, burn that to disc.  H.G. Wells penned his novel, War of the Worlds, in 18...  All right, thank you.  You're a 40s girl interviewing him.  No.  No.  I can't.  You do a 40s girl?  It's so lame.  It's like hacky, and he thinks it's funny.  Oh, like we don't do hacky things here.  Yeah.  Hello.  Tell us about the movie.  People want to know.  I think Martini Steve's going to save us here, Anthony. 
[02:28:30]  The news tease montage.  Oh, wow.  Those same news teases all thrown together in one big cluster F.  All right.  Next at 11.  A 911 cell phone call to save your life could end up costing thousands of dollars.  I'm Brandon Rudat in Ansonia.  We'll have a live report coming up next.  And could you be dabbing bacteria on yourself when you hit the makeup counter at 11?  And is your favorite diner dishing up dangerous food? 
[02:29:00]  Those stories and more at 11.  And is your local senior center dishing up dangerous food?  Is your grocery store one of the filthiest around?  See what we uncovered at 11.

That is one of the funniest bits. 
[02:30:30]  Isn't that great?  What, that thing?  Oh, we've just begun that one.  Let's go to Clark.  Hey, Clark.  How's it going?  Hey.  You think that for $100 million, when the supposed EMP gets set off and takes out everything electronic,  they'd skip the effect of a guy filming the alien with a video camera.  Yeah.  Which I'm pretty sure is electronics.  Yeah.  I don't want to get into things that would spoil the movie, but there's a hundred things like that in the movie.  It's disjointed.  There's tons of plot holes like that. 
[02:31:00]  You're going to have 75 of them written down?  Thanks, Chris.  All of which I will tell you about now in part two of my review.  Oh, another valued listener checking in, Anthony, from Arizona.  Yeah.  Yes, valued listener.  Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment about the other guys who like toast.  Yeah.  I would rather have a bagel.  All right.  Thanks for checking in.  Thank you, sir.  I like different bread products, and I think them commenting on that is fine.  Oh, we've got a news tease coming in from Javier from Jersey. 
[02:31:30]  Go ahead, Javier.  Oh, and A.  Go ahead, Javier.  Yeah.  Javier, but whatever.  Javier.  I've got a news tease for you guys.  All right.  Big Kev, arcade vocabulary-wielding maniac in your neighborhood?  News at 11.  Punching out.  All right.  You can't punch out when you've hit the ground.  Yeah.  We're going to take a quick break, Anthony, because I think that's the only way to regroup.  We've got Frank back. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, it's not Kermit.  It's just another guy named Frank.  Is this Frankie that was in an Escalade last night?  Frank.  No?  Yes.  You've got to hold through a really quick break, all right?  Stay there.  Not a problem.  Wait, wait, wait.  We convinced this guy to get a divorce.  I want to see what that's all about.  And then we've got the Tom Cruise thing.  I've got to get a divorce.  The email from just a listener who thinks he knows what's going on with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.  We'll get into those two things in just a bit.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  We'll be in the camp today.  Here we go. 
[02:32:30]  Walk on, walk on.  Give it to me.  Suck it.  He, he, he, he, he, he.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  What an ass. 
[02:33:00]  I can't believe it.  Are you a game?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, goddamn.  All right.  Say what again?  Come on.  Say what?  What?  What the fuck?  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Fuck.  Oh.  Fuck you listening.  Fuck it.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Back, back, back it up. 
[02:33:30]  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  The APNM of the year.  XM202.  Feeling roses disappearing into moldes and dry mouths.  Breaking into part not stealing our intentions.  And the city lives in oil.  Crying freedom.  And the two are solution.  So you'll be the slides from the tablecloth. 
[02:34:00]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  All right, let's say hi to Bill in Massachusetts.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  On the Hillman morning show, they had Jim Gaffigan on.  And then Dennis Leary called up.  And he said, oh, yeah, we did Opie and Anthony yesterday together.  And the Hillman all got all stirred up.  Oh, he did?  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Got a little nervous?  A little nervous.  Mentioned the competition's name.  That's funny.  What did he say?  He said he just got a little nervous.  Mentioning the competition's name.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Watch out.  People, there's an ozone midget sighting, but it's on instant feedback.  57th Street, Steinway Building.  He's got giant teeth and tiny hands and an IQ of 30.  That's from Mump Rap, and he's celebrating his 50th birthday today.  Mump Rap. 
[02:35:00]  Mump Rap in New York.  Mump Rap has been emailing me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a funny line there, Mump Rap.  That's very funny.  Stop with the yogurt and the spoon.  Why do you guys get the cheap coffee?  What do you mean?  It's not just...  Dude, why don't you talk into a mic?  You've been doing our show for years.  The other stuff is too strong.  Give Bonnie that mic back.  All right.  Scram.  Scram, he tells his girl.  Scram, dame.  Yeah.  The other stuff is too strong.  Aw.  That's the kind of coffee we drink at Joy's house when we go there. 
[02:35:30]  He called me yesterday and name-dropped Joy Behar.  Oh, I know.  We had cheese and crackers at our house yesterday.  Two seconds into this studio, he started...  Joy Behar.  ...with a mouthful of Pop-Tart.  Did you think of a worse celebrity to name-drop?  I know.  It was fun.  She was funny.  She's dirty.  But she's not doing the view.  She's pretty dirty.  She's salty.  Salty?  Like hygiene-wise, Opie?  No, she's put together nice.  She's a funny comedian.  She's actually...  It's surprising. 
[02:36:00]  I think we saw her at the Dennis Leary roast.  Was that the...  I saw her open for Newhart at...  But no, I was with you and you were talking to her.  She's at the Trump roast.  Was that it?  No.  She was at the Trump roast.  We couldn't get near any of the celebrities at the Trump roast.  She was at the Leary roast, too.  I almost got us the Lee Harvey Oswald seats for the fucking...  Trump roast.  I finally got that picture online where our seats were, by the way.  Oh, really?  They had a circle, which person way in the background was Donald Trump.  It was hilarious.  No one believed that we could actually see the roast.  You have to look through the trees as the roasties walk up Elm. 
[02:36:30]  That's right.  Bonnie was sitting with us.  Yeah.  My father and his wife.  And everyone was looking up at us and we're thinking, why are they looking up?  Their seats were so bad on the floor, they had to look behind them at the big screen  that we were pretty much behind.  We were behind the screen that is there for people that are too far away on the floor to watch.  We were so far away.  But here's the thing.  I didn't know you guys could have...  We could have walked you downstairs to the, you know... 
[02:37:00]  Oh, where?  Where could you have walked us?  So, anyhow, we're at Joey's house.  There was no seats available.  We were where we were.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just...  I did have fun, though.  We laughed a lot.  Joey's house.  We were at Caroline's one night and Star Jones walks in and goes to me, oh, hi, Rich.  How long ago?  Skinny star or fat star?  Skinny-ish.  Skinny star.  Skinny star isn't even funny anymore.  I used to be able to laugh at how fat she was and we used to joke.  Like, there's no reason to even bring her up anymore. 
[02:37:30]  She's scary looking.  She married a gay guy.  Isn't that funny?  I thought you were going to use the N-word again.  Racist Bonnie.  Nigger.  So, she walked...  She walked...  Caroline, she comes up to me, hey, boss, how you doing, kids?  And walks right by Bonnie like Bonnie...  I go, hi, star.  And she kept walking.  So, Bonnie...  Did she know you or no?  No, but, I mean, I was standing right next to him who she, like, took her long, you know, 
[02:38:00]  nailed hands and was, like, grabbed his...  How do you know Star?  How does she know you?  Well, one...  Did she like you?  Did you speak sign language to her?  One time.  I did the show three times and, you know...  The view?  Yeah, and I, you know, she probably knows me because, you know, I worked on the Oscars  and she's good friends with Chris's wife.  You know, I don't know.  Chris, who?  Rock.  I run into different...  Thanks.  You know...  Just blurted out the first name.  Chris.  Chris.  You know.  So, she ignored Bonnie.  So, Bonnie went to tell the story at Joy Behar's house. 
[02:38:30]  No one listened to her tone.  Oh.  Joy started eating, like, getting cheese and crackers ready in the middle and I was acting  it out, kind of, and I couldn't stop.  She was standing up...  Oh, no.  And no one's listening?  And Rich goes, I'm the only one listening.  Stop doing it.  You keep trying to find someone to make eye contact with?  I'm like, no one left.  That is the worst feeling.  I'm telling her about how someone's ignoring me.  That is awful.  When you're trying to tell a story to other people, somebody's with you that has heard  the story and they're the only one listening.  And you're going and you're like talking to them and it's like, you heard this already. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, that is a real uncomfortable situation.  Oh, that sucks.  And she's acting it out, like, we're doing, we're playing, you know, to rage or something.  Sit down.  No one's listening.  I can't stop.  I can't stop.  Oh, she was committed.  Oh, that's funny.  Well, the first time we, me and her had phone sex.  Why are you telling me this?  I don't know, because I just, it's so...  Well, first of all, tell the story that...  What?  I called you just to say hi. 
[02:39:30]  And he thought I called for phone sex.  And then I was too embarrassed to be like, no, I just called to say hi.  What?  Why would you assume out of nowhere...  Because we didn't know each other very well.  We just, like, had sort of make-out sessions and stuff.  I mean, why was he assuming that a phone call meant phone sex?  Because I was in my hotel room and it was, you know, late in the evening.  Well, it wasn't that late on the West Coast, but it was late.  Here's why.  Because he's a jerk.  Right.  So I talked her into phone sex. 
[02:40:00]  Right?  We're talking, and we're having phone sex, and I said something like...  This is in the middle of it.  I go, you...  Oh, this is a live version now.  What is that?  All right, find the studio.  Sorry, I was going to help out the bit.  I messed it up.  No, it's good.  I just said we were going to play a little Stevie Wonder in the background as this is going on.  Oh.  I've got to continue.  Sorry.  This is such an embarrassing story.  So we're having phone sex, and I didn't know her that well.  And I said to her, I go, you have one of the best pussies I've ever eaten.  She said, one of them?  I didn't say it then, because I was like, I'm close. 
[02:40:30]  Let me just put that out of my head.  Oh, wow.  One of them.  One of them.  I know.  You're on the pussy short list, and you can feel really good about that.  There's only five or six pussies I'd take over yours on the entire planet.  One of them.  You're smooth, Rich.  Top five.  Top five.  That's great, Rich.  I remember in my head just going, ignore it, ignore it, finish up.  Ignore it, and finish up.  You know, if someone says something like that, they've already run through the pussies that 
[02:41:00]  are better than yours in their head.  No.  To realize that you were one of them.  Wow.  Why don't you just tell her, look, you're the first person to actually pick up that I called  tonight.  Very sexy.  That's so awful.  The best part is she's just calling you to say hi, and I love you, and this fucking  pervert is sitting there, and he's already naked, jacking it, jerking off my leg on tail.  I know, I think, like, I was like, hey, what are you doing?  He goes, uh, you got your hand in your pants? 
[02:41:30]  Um, yes.  All right, let's try this again.  She just called to say hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. 
[02:42:00]  Not that tiny hand, get it?  No.  In fact, you're just another ordinary day.  That's lovely.  No, eh.  All right, enough.  Speaking of love, we've got to go to Frank.  Hey.  Hey, Frank.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  That's a great story, by the way, man.  What's up, Frank?  No, what?  What happened?  Yeah, I'm here.  No, not to you.  That's about you.  Frankie, let's go. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, all right.  I just want to say hi and say hi, Sugar Draws.  I want to first of all thank Anthony for about a couple of years ago to inspire me to get  a divorce from my miserable bitch of a wife.  Glad I could help.  And I want to thank Jimmy for his whoring ways for talking me into deciding to go out and  see a couple of prostitutes.  Good boy.  Jimmy does make it sound fun, doesn't he?  It is fun.  It's an adventure.  What gender will you be?  If this ends with full-blown HIV.  No, by the way, I'll tell you after you guys.  You got it, sir. 
[02:43:00]  But very recently, a couple of weeks ago, I was with a very beautiful prostitute who  told me she had a crush on me, and I've been sleeping with her ever since, free of  charge.  You're my idol.  You're my idol, dude.  So I'm a mid-40s man sleeping with a 24-year-old girl, and I just ditched my picture of an ex-wife,  and I wanted to thank you, guys.  You're my idol.  What was the thing we said, or Anthony said, that convinced you to get a divorce?  It's not.  Actually, it was all the stuff that I'm on the show, seeing all the wow stuff, and going  to the website, and seeing all that's out there, and going, what the fuck am I with this 
[02:43:30]  bitch for?  Seeing that people were out there having fun.  Yes, and I wanted to have fun, too.  And the second you were having fun at home, she cut your balls off.  So, dude, how did this hooker just fall in love with you?  Actually, I don't know.  I went with her once, and I was actually dating a friend of hers, and they basically fought  over me.  And she just told me she had a thing for me, and she's been coming over almost every night  since.  That's cool. 
[02:44:00]  Before or after, she blows eight other people.  After.  What's that?  After.  After.  All right.  Did she ever cough and get a tadpole in your pants?  No, never.  But she goes home and takes a shower, and then comes over to my place.  No jealousy issues?  Oh, she takes a shower.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Good for her.  At least she showers and gargles with kerosene.  When she goes out with you and your friends, do you tell your friends to leave their money  at home?  No.  I tell her to bring a friend, and I bring money.  This one's on me. 
[02:44:30]  Yep.  Go ahead, fucker.  All right.  I'm pointing out, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  We go to Frank to a valued listener in South Dakota.  Yes, valued listener?  Yes.  Boys have a penis, and girls have a vagina.  Good point.  Thanks for calling.  Thank you, sir.  I love when the valued listeners get through, because even though their calls might not be  that interesting, at least we're catering to the dedicated listener.  By the way, I have to throw myself under the bus quickly before we do this, because I forgot  to yesterday.  As Nathaniel... 
[02:45:00]  The biohazard team to pick up the blood, then.  Nathaniel so passively, aggressively pointed out, and he was correct.  I stole one of his jokes yesterday, and it was an accident.  He called in and told me that I had stolen one of his jokes, but it was an accident.  The line I thought I improvised about, the child pornography...  Absolutely.  The bad lighting.  That was bad lighting.  That was his joke.  That's right off...  Right out of his act.  Yeah.  I remember seeing that, and thinking it was very funny, and laughing heartily to it.  So, my apologies to him if he's out there listening, and to the man who looks like him here. 
[02:45:30]  He does bear a striking resemblance to a bear.  He certainly does.  Strapping, good smile.  Sheepish.  Shy boy.  All right.  Well, Steve and the rest of us got this Tom Cruise email.  Ooh.  Email from Tom Cruise?  Ooh, cool.  All about Tom Cruise.  Oh.  Guess who didn't get it?  That's exciting.  You didn't get one?  I didn't either.  Hello?  Wait a minute.  Who does the fucking photocopy distribution?  Oh, boy.  Radio program. 
[02:46:00]  I see you got FBI files in front of you.  What's that?  Is it Derek?  I'm going to blame it on Derek, because he's one of the names you're allowed to say.  Okay.  What did you do?  What did you do?  I don't know.  Can I have any?  Why do I not get these?  All I want is a copy of the thing.  I guess we only have one copy in the studio right now.  Maybe we can get some more for everybody?  No, Travis is going to show you up.  I hope he does.  The guy that looks like Travis.  Oh, yeah.  Whoever you are, strapping Slender Boy, my apologies. 
[02:46:30]  Do I have one?  Yes, it's in that stack right there.  Don't hurt it.  Oh, there it is.  I was wrong.  See, we all got a copy.  I was incorrect.  See, we're all equal in the eyes of the interns.  I just want them to make it so the show flows better and everything's there, because when  I don't have one, I get really frightened that things are bad.  These two are communicating with their eyes, and there's some kind of fucking telepathic  thing going on between Voss and Viney.  You know what?  It's hard because he doesn't understand words a lot of times. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, well.  And now I'm trying to, like...  You know what?  You're just trying to communicate.  The more and more I hang out with you guys, I think this marriage has a chance.  I thought it was a sham like everyone else in the beginning, but there's some love going  on.  Well, Voss is one of those guys that will do this.  If you look at him and you're making a let's go, he'll go, why do you want to leave?  All right, so maybe we can get Martini Steven here.  This is...  I'm reading the first paragraph already, and this is bullshit. 
[02:47:30]  It's gotta be.  Well, we're just throwing it out there.  Mm-hmm.  We're not saying this is the truth.  This is what one guy thinks is going on that he heard from a friend who heard from a friend  in L.A.  And Anthony thinks it's malarkey.  I think this is malarkey.  Is it bunk?  No, no.  Tom Cruise woke up in a bathtub in a hotel in ice with a note that said, get to the hospital.  We've taken out your kidney and sold it on the black market.  Stop it. 
[02:48:00]  Where's Martini Steve?  He was the one that got the email.  Is he allowed to show his face?  Martini Steve's working here, right?  You're working here, right?  So we don't have to make believe you're not here?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Steve.  Can you talk into the mic, Steve?  Can't hear you.  Do we have one?  I just see a share.  Don't be shy.  Who would you like to share with?  Let's see who he picks.  Not the girl, Mike.  I didn't know.  I thought she was like...  Quiet moat.  I don't mind taking from Rich.  How are you getting along in the production room with Ron and Fez's people?  Quite well, actually. 
[02:48:30]  Good.  Do you want to draw an accent?  Huh?  What?  Jesus.  It's just talking into air.  Hold on.  Clint from Whack Bag wants in here.  Yes, Clint?  The boys get copies.  The boys get copies.  I like it.  Paul Anka.  All right.  Very good.  The people have finally gotten the Paul Anka impression.  And they're going with it.  Remember how badly they did it the first couple of times?  You didn't even know they were trying to do the Paul Anka thing. 
[02:49:00]  Now they got it.  They're committed to the bit.  Remember the first...  The guys get shirts.  Yeah.  The guys get the shirts.  The shirts go to the guys?  No, you douchebag.  All right, Steve.  Where did this email come from?  It came from someone who's claiming to be a legal source.  I think on the West Coast.  I don't really know.  A legal source?  Coming from some kind of legal background.  At least it's...  Does that mean a lawyer?  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  A lawyer?  An attorney at law.  Well, I don't know.  It could be a receptionist in a lawyer's office, for all I know.  So I didn't really...  The bail was stupid.  Yeah, exactly.  We're calling Bravo Sierra on this one.  A little Bravo Sierra?  It could be.  It could be, but it's not the first email like this I've gotten.  So, thank you, Jim.  Anthony, would you like to read this one?  I'll give it a try.  Maybe we should let Rich read this one.  It's in big print.  Well, let me see it.  Look at the subject that even annoys me.  You guys might like to make hay with this one. 
[02:50:00]  From Legal Steve.  Make hay.  You want Voss to read it?  Good luck in getting a copy.  Could someone bring one of the copy in for our friend Rich, please?  I don't have my glasses, but I'll try.  You wear glasses?  Only when I read.  You're so sweet.  Thank you, love.  I didn't know that.  Huh?  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  Forget it.  Wait, Voss can have my copy.  Go ahead.  Oh, boy.  All right, Voss.  This is big news, so. 
[02:50:30]  The Insider might be listening in right now and taping this for The Insider.  Yeah, I'm not going to piss Tom Cruise off.  He's like, I just read the top ten people in Hollywood.  He's like number three.  I know, and you're number 8,451.  Could you please read it?  What do you think?  You're up for Mission Impossible 3 between you and Philip Seymour Hoffman?  What is that movie, Mission Impossible 3?  You're getting the cock out of your mouth?  Okay, a friend of mine. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  And we don't communicate by eye.  It was so funny.  No, because Bonnie looks over, and of course it's radio, so you can't really do it.  But she looks at Rich and does this thing like her eyes get wider and then go back to normal.  I am trying to communicate with you.  And she's like her neck will kind of crane, so her head goes up a little bit.  There's all kinds of little things going on between you two while we're just doing the show.  Don't use the reason I brought that up while you did that so I could practice read this real quick.  Ah, a little proofreading. 
[02:51:30]  Won't help.  A friend of mine just got back from L.A. and heard the scoop about Tom and Katie from someone who works at Universal.  Oh, Jesus.  What was the scoop?  Lung cancer?  Coming up.  That sounded like you're backwashing a pool filter.  That was, there was gurgling, there was something in the line.  Wow.  The source said that they, Tom and Katie, have a five-year-old contract and he's paying her eight million. 
[02:52:00]  It's not a five-year-old contract.  A five-year contract.  Five-year contract.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, the, uh, engagement happened so fast because, well, uh, uh, a five-year contract and he's paying her eight million dollars.  Eight million over five years.  To be his, like, chick.  To be his fiancée, chick, perhaps even bride.  That's not bad.  Eight million for five years with that kind of money?  She's hot.  Yeah.  You know?  How many trips to Edelweiss is that?  Uh, man, I'm fucking on fire today. 
[02:52:30]  Uh, the engagement happened so fast because Rob Thomas, Matchbox 20, wife caught Rob and Tom in bed together and they rushed the engagement that it would overshadow that scandal.  Hot OBV.  Obviously, take it with a grain of salt.  Uh, this is Jim Norton, Opie and Anthony, out.  So, they're saying that they caught him with a guy.  Rob Thomas. 
[02:53:00]  Rob Thomas from Matchbox 20.  Is he good looking?  Yeah.  The girls seem to like him.  Matchbox 20.  Wow.  And, uh, so, so this guy is claiming that the, the engagement's a sham, he's paying Katie Holmes to be with him, and the engagement happened so quickly to overshadow the fact that, uh, Rob Thomas and Tom Cruise were in bed together.  His wife caught Rob and, see, that whole thing just doesn't make sense. 
[02:53:30]  Tom Cruise goes over Rob Thomas' house, has sex in the bed with, with the wife walking in on him.  If, if, if, if Tom Cruise and Rob Thomas are having sex, they're doing it like in a vault somewhere where nothing is ever going to get out.  Tommy and Jimmy do it.  Yeah.  Goes somewhere out of the way.  That's right.  Bank vault on off hours.  No one can walk in.  Yeah.  But it's so hard for us because he's such a germaphobe.  He won't let me touch his cock.  That's right.  Put on these rubber gloves and jerk me off.  Just look at it and tell me what you would do. 
[02:54:00]  You're a germ-ridden freak.  I don't buy that.  This is like the old gag years ago with Rod Stewart and Mick Jagger where they had to pump Rod Stewart's stomach because he had so much jism in it.  Oh, God.  Remember that old rumor that was around years ago, that delicious rumor?  Yeah, but why couldn't he be with Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart?  I mean, during the same business.  Mick Jagger and David Bowie.  Yes. 
[02:54:30]  You know how much cum you have to swallow to throw up from it?  It's got at least a week's worth.  I was just going to ask.  All right.  Read on because it's like there's a mistress involved.  Independent sources.  Confirms existence of Tom Cruise, Rob Thomas rumor.  Announced today.  Uncovered a new, previously undiscovered Tom Cruise rumor about the Rob Thomas Matchbox 20.  Independent sources has hesitated writing about Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, for many reasons. 
[02:55:00]  First, there are other things going on in the world that, believe it or not, rank higher on the importance scale.  To who?  Second, pretty much everything that can be said is being said.  However, someone, I'll call her mistress of the Hollywood rumor, just walked into Insider's office with the following dish that I feel compelled to pass on.  I did a quick check of Technorati, and it wasn't there. 
[02:55:30]  What is the Technorati?  I don't know.  Kind of like the...  Maybe like a website of paparazzi.  Did you say paparazzi?  Did I?  A big, fat website.  Flem.  So even if it's not true, it is at least original.  No doubt that anyone with an internet connection has read about Tom Cruise being gay.  According to rumor lore, he has had a long-time boyfriend in Chicago who is an Asian pilot for American Airlines. 
[02:56:00]  This is an accusation that Cruise, and more importantly, Cruise's many attorneys, vehemently deny.  There have been many stories that supposedly corroborate his sexuality, but never a smoking gun.  Is that what?  Corroborate.  Why?  No, the word before that.  Supposedly?  I think you said supposedly.  No.  No, supposedly.  I think I used to say supposedly, which is really stupid. 
[02:56:30]  That was many years ago.  Isn't that wrong putting a V in there if you feel it belongs?  Someone corrected me.  Don't make me give you the finger.  Finger.  Rumor mongers attribute this to the fact that Cruise goes to great lengths to cover his tracks.  We are told that everyone around him signs extensive confidentiality contracts with enormous penalties for indiscretion.  This eight-page confidentiality contract Cruise's housekeeper was forced to sign.  Such stories have been around for years, and Cruise has evidently attempted to counter them with a series of high-profile heteronormative relationships? 
[02:57:00]  How the fuck is that?  First, Nicole Kidman, then Penelope Cruz, and most recently, Katie the Wad Holmes.  Wait, before Nicole Kidman, there was Mimi Rogers.  Oh, yeah?  She was on a show recently looking real old.  Oh, yeah, but she used to be hot in the rapture.  So they live with each other.  That's got to be a cool gig.  You just live with somebody famous.  You can't be seen publicly banging anybody for five years, and your career goes through the roof, and you're set for life. 
[02:57:30]  Plus years, though.  Then why did Nicole and him break up their fake marriage?  Maybe it was only a five-year contract or whatever.  I'm guessing.  Here's a little tidbit from my own personal collection.  What, Ant?  Remember Tree Fort Richard?  Yeah, the kid that I grew up with wound up being gay and tried to sexually assault me in a tree fort.  He leaned over and went, can I suck your cock? 
[02:58:00]  And I may believe I was asleep, just cowering in the corner.  Well, he wound up, after I came back to New York a few years later, I guess when he was about 18, 19, something like that,  he wound up being Christy McNichol's beard at movie premieres and stuff.  Really?  Yeah, he used to go and escort Christy McNichol to various things so people wouldn't think she was a dyke.  So they would go out together, and he didn't care.  There was no danger.  So it's got to be pictures of this guy. 
[02:58:30]  Got to be.  That's trying to blow you.  Got to be.  Some old tabloids or something.  Yeah.  Do you think he listens to this show and just jerks off to your voice?  I'll take a rain check.  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  Jesus.  Let's see.  Okay, most recently Katie Holmes.  In each instance, the relationship, and they put that in quotation marks,  is actually a contract that gives the woman a boost to their careers, a lot of money, and an elegant lifestyle.  Here's where this particular rumor gets interesting. 
[02:59:00]  Not long ago, Marisol, the wife of Matchbox 20's Rob Thomas,  who has had to contend with his own rumors of bisexuality,  found her husband in bed with Tom Cruise, causing Cruise people to shift into high gear.  You know, this doesn't mean they're gay.  Maybe they just went into bed to jerk off together.  Yeah.  That's true.  Just play with my nipples.  Don't look at me.  No, that could happen.  Tell them, Rich.  Guys sometimes just get into bed and jerk off together.  Yeah, when you're either 16 or you're just famous and you can't, you know. 
[02:59:30]  When you have Katie Holmes waiting for you at home.  But it wasn't gay because there was a girl in between you two at the time.  Well, not these two.  Talking about when he grew up.  Right.  When I grew up.  You jerked off with a guy when you grew up?  Yeah, you weren't in that day we talked about it.  Oh, you were gone.  Yeah, me and my friend.  Who is he?  How old were you?  You know, like 16 or 29.  16, him and a guy friend of his were laying in the same bed.  Wait, you weren't here for this story? 
[03:00:00]  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  If I wasn't, I wouldn't be filling up right now.  So what?  No, I didn't hear this story.  So we just, you know, sometimes we'd get high and party and I'd sleep over at the house.  You know, if we were sleeping over.  And, you know.  If you were sleeping over?  You know, if I, yeah, sometimes I would have.  You don't have sleepovers at 16 anymore.  No one cops crack and then calls their parents, look, I'm staying over so-and-so.  No, I wasn't back in the crack day.  I wasn't doing crack at 16.  You don't do sleepovers at 16.  That's, you're drunk and pass out at a friend's house, but not.  Right.  You don't end up in the same bed jerking off together. 
[03:00:30]  He only had one bed in his room and we both wanted to jerk off.  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  You have one of the best tasting spurs.  You're one of the nicest conks I've ever seen.  I've seen plenty.  I've jerked off in the weirdest places, man.  Don't you have, like, I used to, you know, at work.  There's a difference between jerking off in a weird place, like at work or something like  that, and jerking off with another man next to you.  Yeah, I remember one time I was working at the Ironworks place.  I was upstairs doing some carpet, you know. 
[03:01:00]  Uh-oh.  And I just started jerking off.  You decided to just jack it right there.  Yeah, you never did stuff like that.  The workplace jack?  Yeah, sometimes you just got out of control, so horned up you had a jacket at work.  No way.  But you're a frigging comic and you've never worked a day in your life.  What, are you going to get on stage?  Excuse me, people.  I'm a little horny.  Do you have a real job?  Anytime of your life?  Forklift operator.  You were a forklift operator?  I did.  I had a big boom on the front.  I loved copper trucks.  Yeah, I did all kinds of work.  Okay, then you're a real job.  I apologize, Jimmy.  I was a forklift operator. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  It's always a launching pad for comedic talents.  That's pretty cool.  All right, continuing.  Oh, right.  First, Mrs. Rob Thomas was bought off for an undetermined sum.  Secondly, Cruise and his handlers set out to immediately find Cruise a girlfriend.  Second-tier actresses were targeted.  A list was drawn up with Jessica Alba, the number one pick, and three other girls who fell  out for various reasons.  Originally targeted number three, I think, but later rejected as undesirable, was rumor 
[03:02:00]  queen, Lindsay Lohan, way down, coming in at number five on the list was Katie Holmes,  but that was the one who they were able to strike a deal with.  Once the contract was signed, photo ops were set up, leaks were made to the right places,  and we've had celebrity relationship on steroids ever since.  Wow, this is some bold accusations.  I'm not going to say it sounds like, there's a lot of it that does sound accurate.  It makes sense.  It could be bullshit, but it just sounds accurate. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, it's, I mean, we don't have enough information here to really make a judgment here in the  Swiss court.  I'm going to dedicate the rest of my life to finding out the truth about this.  Me too.  Yes, as I think we all should.  Well, next time you have Jay Moore on, ask him what Tom tastes like.  He was in Jerry Maguire with him, right?  Did you have to explain that?  No, I'm saying he did the movie with him, right?  It bombed, and you went, well, no, I mean, they were in there.  Well, so you have one.  One thing I will credit this rumor for is how it nicely explains Tom's behavior this 
[03:03:00]  past few months, including the couch-jumping episode on Oprah.  Cruz simply didn't have time for the home's rumors to circulate at its normal speed, and  he couldn't allow it to be second-page news while the tabloids focused on Brad and Jennifer  and Angelina.  No, this relationship had to immediately become the it topic.  And that's how we hear it.  I'm in love.  That was kind of really over-the-top acting, kind of, I'm in love. 
[03:03:30]  Well, did you see her when she was interviewed?  She said that she fell in love when he said, like, she had the eighth-best...  Oh!  No, let Cindy Brady finish the line.  Eighth-beth.  Eighth-beth.  Why do you put a T-H before a joke with a fucking S-T and it's stupid?  Why did I do that?  Eighth-beth.  She said to him, you had me at eight million.  Oh, that's not bad.  Eighth-beth.  Eighth-beth.  This email finishes with basically saying, you know, this is, as of now, a rumor. 
[03:04:00]  Unsubstantiated rumor, blah, blah, blah.  And this is how this guy is protecting his ass, I think.  But what's the big deal?  Even if you say he is gay, what if he just comes out?  Do you think it's going to ruin his career?  No, not at all.  What would help is he's the biggest heartthrob in the country.  Oh.  So he'll be heartthrob for men now.  I don't think anybody would really...  To be honest, I don't think people would care.  He's in his 40s now.  It's like, dude, you're worth a hundred million?  It's like, if he is, just big deal.  That's what I'm saying.  What's the big deal?  Why keep covering up having these people? 
[03:04:30]  No, you don't fall in love in three weeks and get married, right?  You're talking from the New York point of view.  Or L.A.  Not the middle America.  You know, fuck the faggots.  I'm not watching him in an action movie.  But even if he always had to change things, you know,  I'm going to rescue that small furry animal.  Maybe.  He just acted that out.  He did.  He had a clenched fist that he shook.  Jesus, I just gave you a call back.  He shook his fist. 
[03:05:00]  Jesus.  I'm going to...  Why?  And I'm shaking it now.  Fat.  So there you have it, Ant.  Thank you.  That's something.  Yeah, it can't be...  That email's going everywhere at this point, so...  Printer not working.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What?  There is, of course, the fact that she's a self-proclaimed virgin, Kitty Holmes. 
[03:05:30]  Is she?  Stop it.  And Tom Cruise has been rumored to be less than interested in sex.  Mimi Rogers, his first wife, once told Playboy that Cruise considered being a monk and felt  that having sex would hinder his desire for purity.  If both these things are true, it certainly would make Holmes the perfect platonic partner.  So who knows?  That's creepy, too, a 26-year-old virgin.  It is awful.  Something a little odd.  Something going on there, right?  Yeah.  Something a little off about that one. 
[03:06:00]  You're thinking, what happened to those other 14 years, huh?  Get it?  12.  Oh.  I did the math, Rich.  I mean, I couldn't do the math.  I know.  I was trying to do math.  That was the problem.  When you do a joke and the audience is like, carry the link, I can't figure it.  I need a calculator to get Rich's joke.  Jesus.  I was popping up the calculator on the computer.  My computer overloaded from Rich's joke.  I didn't have enough RAM.  Wow.  If Tom Cruise leaves on a train from Philadelphia at 8 o'clock, a cock is coming eastbound. 
[03:06:30]  Wendell in his mouth.  Let's say hi to Tennessee Tom.  Tennessee Tom, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Bonnie, Rich.  Hey.  I'm Curtin-Steady.  Hey.  Okay, if you go back to all the interviews that Tom Cruise and Katie had, they never get  into specifics in anything.  Yeah.  Every time they ask, where'd you meet?  All Tom Cruise says is she's a wonderful girl.  Wonderful and utmost respect.  I admire her.  It's nothing passionate about how hot either one is or how much they want to have sex or 
[03:07:00]  any passion behind it.  It's like a working relationship.  Yeah.  I admire that person.  They're wonderful.  Do you think you...  Let me ask you a question.  If Tom Cruise is gay and if you're a gay guy banging him, do you think all you're thinking  of is, Jesus, how do I not have a camera?  This is a fucking...  This is a house in the hills.  If I can get a picture of this.  Click.  Yeah.  Click, click, click, click.  God, I wish I was better looking and then he liked me.  Imagine you just hold the camera away and go, Tom, whoo, click, that shot, whoo, put 
[03:07:30]  no, look up, click, Marlon Brando shot.  Wow.  That's circulating around Hollywood.  Yeah, the underdogs, cock, Wally Cox, cock.  What, Marlon Brando was with Wally, no.  Yeah, Marlon Brando and Wally Cox, roommates, back in the olden days.  And apparently they had a sexual relationship.  There's a picture that is supposed to be Marlon Brando sucking Wally Cox's dick.  I've never seen it.  You've never seen that picture? 
[03:08:00]  Because you would have never thought Wally Cox was gay.  Hawk, can you bring that picture up?  I've never seen it.  I've heard about it for years.  I've never seen it.  That picture, yeah, circulated for years.  And then either Playboy or Penthouse or Hustler, one of them printed the picture finally.  Well, how about the one of you here, Sammy Davis was at a party and some girl was blowing  a guy who walked by.  Can I dig on that for a while now?  Can I dig on that, man?  Yeah, and he kind of hopped down on it.  No, he fucked his eyeball.  How awful is that if you're getting blown by some hot chick and then a black Jew with 
[03:08:30]  one eye wants to blow you?  Can I dig on that, man?  Oh, no.  What are you going to say?  Like, well, this is sweet.  All right, let him for a second.  Wait, does it go?  Got to go and eat a cock in her ass.  All right, we have some Tom Brokaw audio.  Tom Brokaw?  What's he doing?  What's he doing out?  He's retired, but now he's doing those special assignments.  He does those things where he just kind of wanders to earth and gets into adventures, 
[03:09:00]  writes stories about it.  Is that what he does now?  They all do that after they stop being anchor.  You all right there, Ropi?  Water went down the wrong way.  You all right, Mortgage Payment?  Get him a robe.  Mortgage Payment.  Did you say earth?  Earth.  Earth.  Yeah.  He did that on purpose, though.  You ever see Pulp Fiction?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great movie.  Yeah.  At the end, Samuel L. Jackson talking about how he's going to just walk the earth, getting  adventures.  Well, on this program, we love to just listen to Tom Brokaw talk and speak. 
[03:09:30]  Because he's got a lisp.  He was the anchorman, the national anchor for NBC Nightly News, and he's got that L problem  where he can't say his L's.  His L's come out like, oh, that, or like a fart out of Jimmy's ass.  You fart in front of Bonnie?  I know.  Bonnie rolled her chair away, put her arms out, just like, what the, why, why?  Because he, but he positioned his ass in my direction. 
[03:10:00]  He pointed it at you.  It was like that.  You don't aim a loaded ass at a girl like that?  No, no.  It just kind of, I was, you know what happened was, you got scared?  There's too many people in the studio, I just get nervous and sneaks out.  Here's the rule with Rich and I.  If we fart, it has to be a joke.  I was all good.  You have to, like, make a, a, a, a room, room, motorcycle thing.  A room, room, motorcycle thing, or pretend you're pulling something out of your butt.  I pulled a lollipop out of my ass the other night.  That was hilarious.  I came and farted at the same time. 
[03:10:30]  And I hope you enjoy my fart on the replay.  Oh, you just did one?  Yeah.  It was a really good one.  That's what the replays are for, for all the shit I miss.  I had a camera in my ass last week.  You did?  What'd you get?  Colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy.  Oh, colonoscopy.  Oh, colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy.  Let me tell you how dumb writers...  I really think an ostomy is when they take something out, when they, like, cut it off.  Well, they take the camera back out.  Or something, isn't it?  Just how dumb writers are.  When they call you to interview you, they...  I said to the guy, you know...  Colonoscopy.  They are the worst. 
[03:11:00]  I go, yeah, I just had, you know, colonoscopy, whatever it can be.  Colonoscopy.  And finally, I found somebody that would do it at my house, right?  At your house, in your bed, with another man jerking off next door.  I met on the subway.  Really?  It happened at your house?  No, you fucking idiot.  You're a writer.  Yeah, it happened at my house.  And the guy also did, like, a root canal and a retina transplant.  You fucking idiot.  He probably didn't...  Rich, remember that reporter that came to Amsterdam to do the story on the comics?  Yeah.  And she only had brought, like, summer clothes? 
[03:11:30]  And she goes, oh, I thought it would be warm.  It's like she couldn't even do research on the weather.  You're a reporter.  Hey, someone's saying you got the Sammy Davis joke wrong.  Go ahead, Doug in Boston.  It's a joke?  Hey, boss, you fucking zilch.  Thank you.  Yeah, somebody was fucking Sammy Davis doing his eyeball.  Wouldn't they fuck his eye socket, you retod?  Oh, come on.  Is that all you got?  Even what you're saying, that's picky.  You're getting a little picky, sir.  And it wasn't the eye socket. 
[03:12:00]  He took the eyeball and rubbed it on his dick, dummy.  Yeah.  All right?  That's what I meant.  All right.  Go listen to Orson Welles.  Tom Brokaw.  Yeah, Tom Brokaw has that problem.  Can't say his L's.  So whenever he does news stories, I can't, I can't, I'm not there with him.  I'm just hearing his lisp.  And one of the most famous ones is when he had to say Achille Lauro, the cruise ship that  Leon Klinghoffer was thrown off of.  And Leon Klinghoffer's bad enough, too.  So it was like the NBC Nightly News, it's Tom Brokaw, tragedy on the high seas, as Leon Klinghoffer 
[03:12:30]  was tossed from the deck of the Achille Lauro, Achille Lauro, Achille Lauro Box.  This just in, a letter carrier in Laredo was licked by a llama, film at, oh, oh, oh, oh, shortly  after 10.  That whole gag.  But now he pops up on Letterman a lot.  I guess him and Letterman are good pals. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, we got some quick clips of him on Letterman last night.  And it's painful to watch, because he's, it's a chore.  He is working to spit this shit out.  We were driving on this very difficult gravel road, and we stopped at this breathtaking overlook,  and a bicyclist came around the corner, with a little two-wheel trailer behind him.  With a little, with a little, with a little, a bicyclist.  He's like, every word he says has an L in it.  Every word has that L, a bicyclist. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  With a little two-wheel trailer behind him.  And I knew from once he'd come, and he was a Brit, and he got off, and he said,  I am eight, and I said, where have you come from?  And he told me, and I said, that's about 40 miles away.  And he said, well, I've got a bit longer to go.  And I said, where are you going?  He said, going to Alaska, actually.  Alaska.  He was bicycling to Alaska, hauling this little trailer behind him.  Thank God.  I often think about it.  From the farthest tip of South America.  From Para del Fuego, all the way to Alaska.  Oh. 
[03:14:00]  From Para del Fuego, all the way to Alaska.  Holy shit.  Hauling this little trailer behind him.  Thank God.  I often think about it.  From the farthest tip of South America.  Para del Fuego, all the way to Alaska.  Oh.  Why couldn't he be going from Detroit to Massachusetts?  It's got to be Para del Fuego to Alaska.  Pulling a little trailer on his bicycle. 
[03:14:30]  I said, from whence did you come, D'Artagnan?  The hell?  I purled my rapier and said, I'll pass.  You shall not pass this way if you're going to Alabama from Godwinville, Lima.  He went through Lima, Saskatchewan.  Isn't that great?  He cannot speak.  Those L's just trip him up every time.  It's a credit to the man that he got the job. 
[03:15:00]  Who auditioned for NBC Nightly News that didn't get the job over the guy that can't say L?  He beat up Betty Davis.  Stroke face.  I want to do the news.  And there I was watching a bicycle go from Prager to Fuego to Alaska.  Next.  I didn't know we had.  All right.  Give a call back to the guy that can't say his ales. 
[03:15:30]  I didn't know we had Mario Cantone in the studio.  I know.  All right.  We get it.  You do her well.  Oh, and then Liza came in.  Did she?  I guess.  Did she?  Really?  Right.  All right.  We got another clip of Tom on Letterman last night.  I got thrown.  One of them was a stupid mistake.  I was riding before sunup up to a neighbor's place to help him drive some cows.  And we got across the cattle guard, and I went to get back on my horse and got about halfway on. 
[03:16:00]  And something, understandably, there in the moonlight, he got spooked and threw me, and I banged at my wrist pretty hard.  What a cowboy he is.  I had to catch the cow, so I grabbed my last, though, my last, the round rope, and threw it over the cow's horns.  Boy, he's a real cowboy.  Yeah.  What a life this guy's living.  Horseback driving cattle.  He lives in 1886.  There it is. 
[03:16:30]  We went to the auction where I purchased three Negroes at a great price of only $17.  I think it's fairly elementary.  And the other big issue is that we're so well behind the curve in dealing with the Islamic rage in the Islamic world.  Huh?  There's not much there.  Islamic.  Good stuff, though.  Yeah.  Do we have the tax cuts one?  Where's that clip?  Oh, the famous one?  God damn it.  Damn it, Hawk. 
[03:17:00]  It's a Tom Brokaw clip.  You've got to finish it up with a tax cunt.  Absolutely.  This is great.  This is great.  He was talking about President Bush's tax cuts, and he was doing his stand-up, and the camera's on.  And I guess it was live.  And he goes, President's tax cunts.  It wasn't even one of those where you're like, where it was like, it kind of sounded like cuts, but it might have sounded like cuts.  Not even close, yeah.  And it was the word.  It freezes.  And there's a pause, and then he figures, I better not acknowledge it, and just moved on. 
[03:17:30]  But he absolutely said it.  And if Hawk can find it, we will hear it.  Eric, where is it?  Why don't we all go take leaks, and we'll try to find the right, all right?  Eric, let's all just go take some leaks.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too, here comes the love-domest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle.  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy. 
[03:18:00]  I'll throw in some sound effects, and a few lines don't make no sense, and open it.  You'll be so proud of me.  Thank you.  I miss the point completely.  I should kill myself discreetly.  This jingle is over my suits, I know.  My life's been kind of rough, and 18 years is long enough.  My dad should have hopped the gun away. 
[03:18:30]  Yay!  I got nothing.  Kofi and Anthony, XM202.  Kind of looks like him, right?  It looks like him, but...  I don't know.  His face is a little distorted in that I'm-sucking-a-dick way. 
[03:19:00]  Well, they didn't have Photoshop back then.  I don't know.  It's Marlon Brando, and, yeah, he's got his lips on a...  A hog.  On a hog.  Hag.  Glad you said that, because I almost said treat.  It's on findadeath.com, I guess.  Findadeath.com has the picture we're talking about with Marlon Brando and Wally Cox.  All right, we're trying to find the Tom Brokaw clip. 
[03:19:30]  We also have audio here, Ant.  A kid playing Xbox.  Oh, yeah, Steve told me about this, and I hadn't heard it yet.  It's a kid playing Xbox, and I guess his mother is yelling at him.  There he is, probably playing online and playing one of those shooters, being a tough guy, and there he is.  Just go show you who you're playing online with when you play online games.  Yeah, Steve, what's this about?  I guess it's a clip. 
[03:20:00]  There's one of those games that you can dial into with Xbox.  I'm not really sure.  It's just one of those first-person shooters.  Right.  And whoever he was playing against was running a videotape or a digital recorder while this kid was being yelled at by his mom on the other end.  So you hear all just gunshots and the kid being reprimanded by his mother.  He got everything on tape?  Yeah, he got everything.  Right.  Big, tough soldier.  And there it is, a little kid being yelled at by his mommy.  It's a plan, man.  It's a plan, man. 
[03:20:30]  Why?  I need it up there.  I need it up there.  No, I have to.  It's a plan, man.  I have to.  Stop.  No, I have to.  Mom, I have to clean that.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  You're so afraid to put everything in your mouth.  You're messing me up, Mom.  It's a plan, man. 
[03:21:00]  You're messing me up.  Stop.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  I'm going to really stop this.  Let's do it down, boy.  No, don't turn it off.  Mom, why do they have no blouse?  I'm doing some dance.  You're not in bed yet.  Well, I need it on blouse.  Mom, I need it up.  Whatever.  I need it on. 
[03:21:30]  I don't even know if he's playing me.  Don't get off.  Why do I have to get off?  Why?  That's stupid.  You always do that all the time.  You never want me to play it.  You want me to get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Tell me to get off.  I'm in the bed.  Tell me to get off.  Turn it down.  You never want me to have it up loud.  This weekend, you're like,  you know, it's not...  During the weekend, you're going to have it up as loud as you want.  So we can't right now.  So I'm going to get it up.  I'm going to get it down.  Wow, this is so weird, isn't it?  The machine gun fire.  The loading of the weapon.  Mom, you're messing me up. 
[03:22:00]  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  Why?  Why?  Five, four, three.  Okay.  Why?  Why?  Why do I have to...  Oh, kids.  I want to shoot him.  I want to play.  But that...  You know, that doesn't mean that I can actually get off.  No?  Reload.  That's bull.  I want chocolate milk, not fish.  You said that he didn't bring me a drink.  I don't want to not do it.  I want chocolate milk now.  I want chocolate milk now.  I want chocolate milk now.  Why?  That's what I want. 
[03:22:30]  Why can't you get it?  Why can't you get it?  Yes.  Mom.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Mom, please get it.  Why?  That's bullshit.  Whoa.  You said you didn't bring me a drink.  You didn't buy.  No.  You said you didn't give me whatever I wanted to drink.  Now I said I'm out and give it.  Now I want chocolate milk. 
[03:23:00]  You're mean.  You bitch.  What?  I don't like the fucking chocolate milk.  Oh, man.  Why would I get in trouble?  You said you'd bring me whatever I wanted to drink, and now you won't.  That means you're lying.  No.  Bring me chocolate milk.  Why?  I want some motherfucking chocolate milk. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, come on.  I don't have to get up.  You said you'd get it for me.  Why?  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  That's fucked up.  That kid's cursing is so funny.  I don't have to do shit.  That kid's mouth needs to be fucked. 
[03:24:00]  Where's the cop with the laser gun now?  Were you sleeping, Jimmy?  No, I'm just tired.  Wow, what happened?  You all right?  I might have zonked for a second.  I heard the audio.  His head was down, and his eyes were shut.  I heard the audio.  All right.  Everyone's just dozing today.  What do you think of the Kevin's review?  No, I just haven't been sleeping well for last week.  No?  Well, you got your test back.  Yes.  I went for my AIDS test.  Oh, have that one.  Go for it.  I have it. 
[03:24:30]  It's just a relief to know now, because I'm like, all right, I thought so.  No, I can definitely throw the condoms out, because that was quite an expense.  No, I go in for my results.  I got my AIDS and my syphilis.  It was good on both.  And I walked into the doctor's over yesterday, because you have to pick them up in person.  Yeah.  So I go for the...  I called the day before, and they're like, we can't give you results over the phone.  They want to smile at you on the face and just go, congratulations.  Yay, you have AIDS.  You don't have it.  You want to kiss the guy, but he looks like he has it.  Well, no, on the phone, I asked the nurse. 
[03:25:00]  I'm like, look, can you just tell me, please?  And she's like, I cannot give results on the phone.  I said, look, I don't have time to come in.  I have a date tonight.  Oh.  I'm seeing somebody.  Just tell me.  I know you can't say anything.  Is this a bad idea that I see this person?  And she's like, no, it's not a bad idea.  No.  So she pretty much told me everything was okay without saying it.  So I go in yesterday for my results.  I want the paper.  Not because I'm going to go to L.A. in August, and maybe I could fuck a porn chick if I have  results.  Uh-huh.  Maybe, you know, on paper. 
[03:25:30]  So I walk in, and the lady's like, she looks, and she goes, your results aren't back.  And then this is another woman.  And then she goes, oh, yeah, we have them.  And she goes, but you have to see the doctor.  Oh, my God.  And I go, what do you mean?  And she goes, no, no, you have to talk to the doctor.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm like, I want my results.  I really was going to punch a hole through the glass.  I'm like, I want my results.  And she's like, well, you have to talk to the doctor.  And it was like that type of tone.  And I wanted to choke this bitch.  That's scary.  And I thought maybe my cholesterol is high. 
[03:26:00]  I said, geez, I hope I don't have syphilis.  I figured I didn't have the hiv.  But then I'm like, maybe it was a mistake.  Maybe the lady didn't understand me, what I was trying to say about it.  It kept being a bad idea.  So he comes in a half hour later.  I have to sit there.  I was probably in the office for 45 minutes.  And he goes, no, no, it's just a legal thing.  We have to.  Oh, my God.  Legally, I have to tell you.  And I told him what happened.  He goes, ah, she shouldn't do that.  That has to be handled better.  He was annoyed that she did it that way.  Hell, yeah, that's got to be handled better.  And he confessed that he loves Asian porn.  I love this guy.  Did he really? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, he's the greatest.  God, you just brought back a memory.  I had all my tests done with my doctor, the physical and stuff.  And because I got the heart disease in my family, so I'm like, you know, it's time to start getting the ticker, you know, checked literally every year now, right?  So I get all the tests.  And what is it called?  An echogram or echo?  EKG?  No, way past EKG.  What is it called?  Echocardiogram.  Echocardiogram.  Gram.  Gram.  So, and, you know, and I call, same exact thing.  And the reception's like, oh, yeah, yeah, you're going to have to see the doctor. 
[03:27:00]  Oh.  And I'm like, all right, I'll leave right now.  How about next Tuesday?  I'm like, what?  Are you in?  So I had to wait a week.  Because it's the same thing.  I'm like, well, could you tell me something?  No, he's got to talk to you.  What does that mean?  That can't be good.  What happened?  I know, we're going to go there.  Same thing, though.  And then I waited, whatever it was, four or five days, finally go in, and he goes, oh,  yeah, your heart's perfect.  I wanted to belt her in the face for her bedside manner. 
[03:27:30]  Exactly.  Lack of it.  Awful.  Which one, Ant?  Sean?  Sean, hey.  Hey, the kid gets fucking chocolate milk.  The kid gets fucking chocolate milk.  Not a good impression, really.  Here's one.  Mark, you know.  Norton gets test results.  Norton gets test results.  Mark in Oklahoma City.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Big Daddy.  Hi. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, just, I don't know about you guys, but on that sound thing you just did with the  kid cursing his mom, I was crossing my fingers and praying to God I'd hear a sharp smack to  the face and that kid hit the ground.  Yeah.  You're nicer than I am.  I was hoping a gunshot, just a single shot would be fired.  You're not allowed to touch your kids these days.  That's the problem.  That'll work, too.  I hope you guys get Arlie Ernie on the show.  Have a good day, boys.  We've had him on.  We'll have him on again.  We want him badly.  Love that guy.  All right.  We'll try one more.  Paul Anka, everyone. 
[03:28:30]  Paul.  Yeah.  The doctor gives test results.  Don't you understand this?  The doctor gives the test results.  Punching out, John.  All right.  Went to the well.  Went to the well.  Went to the well.  I just did.  I know.  You just did it.  That one, and he just did it, repeated it.  He should have just hung up right after that.  Well, sir.  Anthony, an update on the naked would-be rapist in the Hamptons.  Oh, I heard on the 1010 Winds.  He's been caught.  They caught the guy.  We did this story yesterday.  Hamptons police busted a sex fiend who tried to rape a middle-aged woman in front of an exclusive 
[03:29:00]  country club and discovered he's responsible for dozens of other perverse acts over a three-year  span.  House painter John Giraldo, or Giraldo, G-I-R-A-L-D-O.  Greg Giraldo?  Oh, Giraldo.  Sure.  That, too.  Was college just hours after he allegedly tackled?  Oh, no.  Wasn't Greg Giraldo because he could have not got picked up because nothing he does gets  picked up.  Oh.  That's a great one.  It was too long, but it was very funny.  All right.  He said picked up twice. 
[03:29:30]  Anthony, he was college.  He didn't get picked up because one time he did a thing, he didn't get picked up.  He didn't get picked up at all.  Get the papers.  Get the papers.  Yeah, they collared the guy just hours after he allegedly tackled a 61-year-old local woman  walking on that East Hampton beach.  And, of course, he was the guy that was naked, except for a black ski mask.  Turns out that wasn't a ski mask.  Really, I heard on Winds, he was wearing a black Speedo and running down the beach, and  some lifeguards saw him and thought it was a little odd but didn't think much about it. 
[03:30:00]  And then he heard some screams from the woman, came running, and at that point he saw the  guy run back the other way naked with the Speedo over his head.  Are you serious?  So he put the black Speedo over his head as he was running away.  That's why he was naked.  Yeah.  Sometimes you want to commit a rape, you have nothing to cover your face with.  Yeah.  Sticky expression.  Wow, this guy's a go-getter.  The Colombian immigrant also is suspected of exposing himself to about 30 women out there  in all those nice towns.  Colombian strongest, peeler, everybody. 
[03:30:30]  I like that he raped a middle-aged woman.  You like that?  61 is middle-aged, though?  Oh, yeah.  An older woman, I mean...  Well, they're saying middle-aged.  He was trying...  He's not an ageist.  Yes.  You were correct.  Did you see the guy on the news that raped 3,000 people, 3,000 kids?  I think it was 30,000.  Oh, 30?  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  Yeah.  We were kind of doing the mess and thinking he would just have to go around touching every  child he saw.  It's like grabbing their crotches in supermarkets and everything to get that kind of record. 
[03:31:00]  To get his numbers up, he would just run into a nursery and grab cock, cock, cock, cock,  cock, cock.  Oh, shit.  I'll show Will Chamberlain.  Why did I have to knock my water over acting it out?  Yeah, I know.  You were acting out grabbing little cocks.  I even had my fingers pursed the right way.  Yeah, yeah.  All small.  John in Oklahoma.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, John.  Hey, I wanted to see if Jimmy could give me the cheat sheet for that AIDS test.  Punch it out.  I'm the cheat sheet for the AIDS test, indeed. 
[03:31:30]  It's not that kind of test.  All right.  We're in that weird time of the show.  We can't really start anything new.  It's too early for what we learned.  If you were driving to Mohegan Sun this weekend, what route do you take to get there?  95 North.  Always the best route.  On a Friday.  Leave it at like 3.30.  I got a new car.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a little...  You're playing Mohegan Sun?  Yeah.  You should get the plug in.  Let's go.  Yeah, Mohegan Sun.  We're there, Bonnie and I, and we're going to take the new BMW, the Z3 up.  I saw you pull up to Morton's in that thing. 
[03:32:00]  And then the camera crews jumped out and started filming you.  God, that was awful.  Is it new?  Well, no, it's not new to me.  New to you.  It's nice.  It looks new.  Doesn't smell like bratwurst or cabbage or whatever?  No?  Where'd you buy it?  Normal channels?  Well, no.  I looked on eBay, but I got it from a car lot off of eBay.  Oh, they're always honest.  No, I got a good deal.  You got a great deal, yeah.  Now, this beauty's only been driven on Sunday.  I sound like, what's his name in a league of their own? 
[03:32:30]  Really?  You know who the guy I'm talking about.  No.  He's on SNL.  Natterman?  Oh.  Natterman.  Yeah, he was in a lot of bad movies.  Chris Farley?  No.  Oh, Phil Hartman?  No.  He's alive.  The gay guy.  He's so funny.  Gay guy.  Tom Cruise?  You know, the compulsive liar.  John Lovett.  Oh, John Lovett.  Oh, there you go.  Now I do it.  John Lovett's impression.  Anthony.  Yeah, he never said he was gay.  Anyway, can I give a quick plug?  Yeah.  He played a gay guy. 
[03:33:00]  My Cleveland show sold out for the 23rd of July, so tickets for a second show are going  on sale this Friday morning at Ticketmaster.  Standing room only.  No standing room.  None.  You're not even allowed to stand and go to the bathroom.  No.  The usher will just drag your chair to the toilet.  Cut your legs off so you drop right back to the floor.  Yeah, then roll you in.  I was working at the bottom of a pool hall two weeks ago, and everybody's going, yeah,  we're going to go see Norton at theater next week.  Oh.  In Cleveland?  No, no.  And weren't you in Virginia? 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Down there.  Stay there.  How'd it go?  Good?  It's great.  Here we go.  We could do something quick here.  We could do, got three choices, eh?  All right.  Mumbles Menino.  We always, we like, we like going down the Mumbles Menino route.  We got the Sex Advice from the Grandma.  Yeah.  We could do one of those real fast.  Every time we play one of those, it seems to be one we've heard already.  Nah, I got them.  You got new ones?  Yeah, I think so.  We have one called Prehistoric Vibrators.  Ooh.  And then Deep Throat Audio.  That, actually, we might need more time with that.  Yeah.  The dialogue from the famous Deep Throat movie. 
[03:34:00]  You guys wanted to play, like, 12 minutes of Trinkets I Own from Gorilla Hands?  Oh, that'd be nice.  I said the wrong name of my CD wrong.  Whoa.  How about, uh...  Yeah, what did you just say?  Trinkets I Own, Gorilla Hands.  Trinkets I Own, Gorilla Hands.  How about Norton's mother?  Norton's mother calling him.  No, we'll do Sue Johansson from the...  I say Sue Johansson.  ...Lifetime channel.  Sex Advice from the Grandma.  Actually, this clip's about, uh, tubal ligation or... 
[03:34:30]  Wait.  Are you talking about Pat Battle?  I laughed at every Pat Battle reference like a retard yesterday.  I was thinking about...  I swear to God, I'm obsessed with Pat Battle.  Who isn't?  All I thought about was Pat Battle in different movies for hours yesterday.  When do you think maybe we should take Pat Battle to a doctor?  That's all I can think of yesterday.  Pat Battle. 
[03:35:00]  Put, uh, Pat Battle on it.  Pat Battle.  Won't you, uh, join me?  Say no!  Pat Battle won't allow it!  Oh, for hours I was thinking of her yesterday.  I love her.  Yeah, I listened to the replay and I'm just laughing at every Pat Battle reference that  came up and there were so many of them.  There were so many of them yesterday.  Oh, she's atrocious.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:35:30]  I don't want to do that.  At least Pat Battle, she's an awful, like a hefty, uh, built black woman.  And she's a reporter and she's just terrible.  Eric, can you bring up that picture that's on the fake picture show?  She's been around for years.  She's awful.  She makes really...  20 years probably.  She makes terrible calls to this show.  Pat Battle from Monaki.  Pat Battle's wigs don't come off.  You're going to talk to a man like Pat Battle like that? 
[03:36:00]  Oh, she's just awful.  Pat Battle does not get that picture.  I don't get it, guys.  There's nothing, I know.  There's nothing there.  I just was giggling for hours.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, could your little Jimmy have the hiv?  Find out tonight at 11.  Ah, very good.  More news teases tomorrow on the program. 
[03:36:30]  You like Pat Battle, Doc?  Pinchy!  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Here's my little muffin over there.  Hi.  Hey, today I learned stage four is the enema stage.  Ah, yes.  I don't have to go to stage four today, thank God.  Gary in Wisconsin, what's up?  Gary!  Hello.  Gary, what did you learn on the show today?  DJ?  Yes.  Yeah, you.  I think Anthony's on the right track here.  These reporters, I think I'm going to stay out of the grocery store, too, man. 
[03:37:00]  All them germs on the floors.  Man, I'm out of here.  Wow.  Thanks, that was a gem.  Could be one of the top five worst calls ever.  Just awful.  Wow.  An awful punchline, and it was in the middle.  Yeah.  Wow, let's go to Troy.  Troy, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Did Pat battle from Vicky?  Kill Salve.  Kill Pat battle.  Kill me.  Hey, guys. 
[03:37:30]  I'm out of this one.  I don't really...  I'm trying to.  I'm trying to enjoy it.  It's just a miracle.  No one enjoy it.  Troy, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Bonnie has an 80 ton.  Holy crap.  She does have a nice...  Sir, did you have to say it like that?  It says on the screen, Bonnie.  Yeah, because it says Bonnie has a top five pussy.  Yeah, I changed it around a little bit.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  That's Pat battle.  That's Pat battle.  There she is.  Wow.  No, no, no.  That's Dr. Zay. 
[03:38:00]  Tasty cunt is okay.  That's an all right.  Thank you.  It is dark.  They got a lot of makeup on her, because she doesn't look that good.  That's Pat battle.  Stupid blonde hair.  Hot.  All right.  Let's say hi to Country Bob.  Country Bob, what's up?  I think she dyes it.  Hey, man.  I just want to say, Bonnie, you sound very hot, boss.  You're a very lucky man, but it's kind of funny.  Doesn't you think she sounds a little bit like Sarah Silverman?  Ugh.  No.  Hey, it's Sarah.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Hey, guys. 
[03:38:30]  That really does sound like her.  Let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that black men should not shop for Escalades in Howard Beach at 3 in the morning.  There you go.  Let's go to Todd in East Islip.  Todd?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey, Todd.  Hey, even with Bonnie in studio, Rick Foss still isn't funny.  I know.  I disagree.  I thought Moss had a fine appearance today.  Yes.  Go to Post Tours.  They're my favorite now.  Let's go to Dave in Texas. 
[03:39:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned that a letter carrier was licked by a llama in Laredo.  Oh, yeah.  Love you, little Jimmy.  Bye, mister.  Let's go to Boston.  Pat, what did you learn on the show today?  Oh, yes.  Jimmy kicks the my fires in the stomach, and you guys suck.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, fellas.  I learned that the listeners can't do Paul Anka impressions.  They're getting better, though.  Thank you, Rolf.  Thank you, Rolf.  Wow.  Yeah, wow.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, boys. 
[03:39:30]  Today, I learned that Anthony calls kids little yuck, and also that justice with holes in it  is Swiss justice.  Swiss justice.  That was early in the show.  Ah, it was very good.  Get to hear that a few minutes, I think.  What was that saying, Hawk?  That was like a two-minute warning.  Oh, my watch is off.  No, actually, it was going with a two-minute and 20-second warning, right?  Ooh.  Pat Battle's got lifeless eyes.  Black eyes like a doll's eyes. 
[03:40:00]  I don't want to open that fish and have Pat Battle's gone off the dock.  You go in the cage.  Cage goes in the water.  Pat Battle's in the water.  Our Pat Battle.  Farewell and adieu to your fair Spanish lady.  We're fine.  Just fishing out here.  I haven't caught much.  Just a Pat Battle or two.  You got soft hands from counting money all your life.  I'm not talking about hooking nanny bluegills or tommy cats. 
[03:40:30]  I'm talking about Pat Battlin.  I'm talking about sharking.  Let's see, remember this, though.  Tie me a Pat Battle knot.  I don't know this Pat Battle.  I don't know what she does.  In my room, where me and my wife sleep, where Pat Battle comes to play with her toys.  Howard Hoo-Hoo in Miami.  What did you learn on the show today? 
[03:41:00]  I learned that my bidet can literally save my ass.  Oh.  And it has.  Right.  Way to tag it.  I know.  And it has.  Timing is everything.  Let's say hi to Mike in Brooklyn.  Hey, Mike.  One in trouble, call Crowbar.  That's right.  Crowbar.  We did learn that today.  I don't get this one.  Maybe it'll make sense when he says it.  Kirk?  I learned that the...  Ah, fuck, punch out.  Wow.  See, that's punching out before the crash. 
[03:41:30]  That guy was smart.  Very good.  That's the proper usage of punching out.  Saw his ship going in.  Boof!  Hit the handle.  Not people that crash or a crater in the ground, punching out.  Too late.  Ooh.  Wow.  Ah, our listeners are morons.  Oh, my.  Morons and pests.  Oh, yeah.  We want to thank that person that did the assault on the media.  Yeah, excellent job.  Actually, it was Danny, because Danny's not here.  That's right.  He's out promoting the show, and he got on Fox & Friends today. 
[03:42:00]  Hey, great job by young Danny.  Are we going to get that video up on opianthony.com?  Cool.  That was...  It could have been the best one, you know.  It was a national show.  It was on there for a really long time.  I bet Nathaniel is somewhere shaking his head no.  I bet somewhere.  Let me look.  If you missed it, the video will be up on opianthony.com.  Anthony, what's up?  Nothing, Opie.  It's almost the end of the show, and I'm looking forward...  Oh, a caller.  Hi, Anthony.  Hey, boys.  Fox is the dumbest white man alive. 
[03:42:30]  Uh-huh.  Out.  Why do you have to separate it by race?  I want to thank XM.  They gave me a mi-fi.  Good.  They should have.  You're always on the show.  You should have got one.  It's only right.  A very happy 50th, by the way.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Do you?  And I'm so far from dumb.  Of course.  Raised two beautiful daughters.  You did.  You're a good dad.  And you are far from dumb.  But keep working.  You'll get there.  Ben, what's on the show tomorrow? 
[03:43:00]  True bogey.  True bogey is going to be mixing.  True bogey will talk to Pat from Manaki.  Pat from Manaki?  Oh, yeah, because he's in Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest this weekend.  Oh, that's this weekend, yeah.  And supposedly there's all sorts of rules and all sorts of things that are pretty interesting.  Who knew?  All these rules.  So Pat will give us the inside scoop on that.  And are the girls going to be handing out the WOW stickers?  Rescheduled.  Rescheduled.  Why?  Can we get another strip club to do it? 
[03:43:30]  Huh?  No, no, no.  We'll redo it.  All right.  So no one should show up at the station tomorrow?  No, we'll do it in two weeks.  All right.  So don't show up at the station tomorrow.  Help us out by handing out WOW stickers.  Benny.  All right.  Look at that hog.  Oh, my God.  So huge.  Everyone, just look at Ben's hog.  That's how we'll end the show.  I don't want to touch it.  Just look at it.  Just stare at the lusciousness.  And the goodness of it.  What is this?  And a baby?  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.
