<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens in chaotic fashion, with the hosts struggling to remember their planned segments ("Two-fers," "Rock Scream Tuesday," "Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday," "Hummer Tuesday," etc.),  a missing microphone adding to the initial pandemonium.  A listener, Kevin, attempts the "Wake Up Your Spouse Tuesday" segment with a rock scream, but receives a low score due to poor phone placement.  A caller, Andrew from Brooklyn, provides extended comedic relief by repeatedly mispronouncing "space shuttle Endeavor" as "spatial Endeavor," a bit prematurely cut short by Bob Kelly, resulting in angry outbursts and threats of violence from Opie towards Kelly.

The anniversary of the atomic bombings of Japan sparks a darkly humorous discussion, seguing into a commentary on a New York City traffic jam caused by a poorly parked van.  The show returns to the "Wake Up Your Spouse" segment, before launching into a completely fabricated "Make Up Stuff Tuesday" where hosts and callers invent false facts about Hawaii and mandatory homosexuality.  A purported UFO video over Haiti is analyzed, with listener calls contributing to the speculation, including a theory suggesting aliens might be the less intelligent members of a more advanced interstellar society.  The segment concludes with a discussion of a news anchor uncontrollably laughing during a fatal accident report, and a darkly comedic imagining of a home invader's final thoughts when confronted by a shotgun-wielding homeowner. Jokes about Jewish neighbors and their neighborhood watch are also made.

The broadcast continues with a discussion of a neighbor dispute, followed by a debate on the adorableness (or lack thereof) of a viral video of otters seemingly holding hands.  News stories covered include the plight of trapped miners, Carl Rove's resignation, President Bush's perceived inactivity, and in-depth speculation on the Iraq War and military tactics, including the use of robots.  A bizarre rap performance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, featuring Carl Rove, is discussed, with the hosts offering apologies for its potentially offensive nature.  Further topics include viral cat videos, the death of Brooke Astor, and an extensive analysis of the Van Halen reunion tour, speculating on internal band conflicts between David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen, and the role of Wolfgang Van Halen.  The death of a wrestler, the upcoming Opie and Anthony live show in D.C. (including their "Car Crash Comedy" segment), the space shuttle Endeavor's return, Michael Vick's suspension, and the death of the world's oldest woman (with speculation about her life in 1893) are also covered. Louis C.K. is a guest throughout this portion of the show.

A segment focuses on the birth and death years of historical figures, including Herman Goering and Jimmy Durante, in relation to the very old Japanese woman. Callers contribute details, and the hosts engage in crude and offensive jokes about the woman's age, appearance, and sexuality.  The main focus then shifts to Maury Povich's phobia show, with descriptions of clips featuring women with extreme fears of birds, cotton balls, frogs, and lizards. The hosts and Louis C.K. react to the clips, emphasizing Maury's confrontational approach and the comedic absurdity of the situations.  Offensive language is repeatedly used toward the women on the show.  Louis C.K. discusses his own YouTube videos, including one about stealing a child's ice cream, detailing viewer reactions ranging from positive to extremely negative. The segment concludes with listener calls, technical difficulties, and further offensive jokes.

Another segment features Louis C.K. discussing a rejected HBO pilot video satirizing the Catholic Church and alleging sexual abuse of young boys, detailing its production and lack of YouTube repercussions. The segment also includes Louis C.K.'s bogus 911 call recordings featuring racist remarks, a recurring bit about a staff member's unusual eating habits (Sam), and clips of news reporters making on-air blunders, including a reporter laughing uncontrollably during a fatal accident report.  A crying wrestling fan and a flustered weatherman during Hurricane Katrina coverage are also highlighted.  The hosts and Louis C.K. engage in highly offensive and sexually explicit discussions throughout.

The final segment discussed barometers, transitioning into vulgar descriptions of vaginas. A Whackbag segment follows, with Opie’s team jokingly named after his and a woman’s ages.  The hosts analyze a contentious exchange between a news anchor and a weatherman regarding Melania Trump's name, followed by a discussion of a leaked 1994 recording of two news anchors arguing before a live broadcast.  Don Imus' $20 million settlement with CBS is speculated upon, along with the WWE storyline involving Vince McMahon's illegitimate child, with the hosts employing highly offensive language and speculation.  Crude and offensive language and humor are prevalent throughout, with Louis C.K. providing a final plug at the end.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  They are sick. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh yeah, I need my mic.  I saw that.  I had it swung away.  I'm like, something's missing.  I'm just looking at my computer monitor going, something doesn't feel right.  Only the most important thing for the broadcast.  I can't broadcast without the mic.  It was way over there.  Ah, tool.  Morning.  Ah, good morning.  Jeez.  Time for the Opie and Anthony show.  Phones are working. 
[00:02:00]  Seemed like there was a bit of a panic about five minutes ago.  We're all right.  We were panicky Pete.  All right.  It looks like the phone number's working.  877-212-ONA.  O-N-A.  And let's find two for Tuesday.  No?  Two for Tuesday?  How about we play two first today?  Two-fers, everybody.  How far?  No, we actually got our own Tuesday thing happening.  Oh, right. 
[00:02:30]  Let me see if I can remember.  Try to remember all of them.  Nope.  Can't remember.  Come on.  Tuesday.  Come on.  Tuesday's a big get.  Extreme camel toe?  That's Thursday.  Damn it.  I knew it was a tea day.  Hot talk Tuesday.  Come on.  That's Monday.  Imagine.  I hope you're kidding, by the way.  I have no idea. 
[00:03:00]  It's Tuesday.  Tuesday's the big get.  You don't know?  You don't know?  Phone call Tuesday.  That's Thursday.  Damn, the Thursday thing has got me all.  You're kidding, right?  You're kidding, right?  No, I wasn't.  Did you sleep on another chair last night?  Are you not with us?  I haven't been sleeping for the past couple of days.  You really don't know what today is?  It's rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  Very good.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  What else?  Have a Lemon Drop Tuesday?  Have a Lemon Drop Tuesday.  Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  And then the other thing that ends with Tuesday.  It's the other thing.  Are you kidding me?  Door is a Jar Tuesday.  We got rid of that one.  We can bring it back if we want. 
[00:04:00]  That was Make Up Your Roommate Tuesday.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  That's the worst fire sound, by the way.  Yeah.  And that was a nice...  That was the short promo.  It's short promo Tuesday.  It's real short promo Tuesday?  Wow, that was a short one.  Well, if the disc was marked right,  that was supposed to be the Hummer Tuesday.  Oh, Hummer Tuesday.  Damn.  But instead of Hummer Tuesday, 
[00:05:00]  you got the Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday in that slot.  So hopefully in the Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday slot  should be the Rock Scream Tuesday sweeper.  Let's see.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday.  No.  No, that wasn't it.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  This disc is damaged there, E-Rock.  Anyway, it's Hummer Tuesday.  Yes.  See, number six is Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday,  and number 14 is Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday. 
[00:05:30]  Now it's Wrong Disc Tuesday.  There seems to be a problem.  So it's Hummer Tuesday.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Tuesday.  And Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  Already a week has gone by since we've taken our last faraway phone calls?  It seems like just yesterday.  I don't think we got to one last week because we were a bit busy, so.  Hopefully today somebody will be calling from far, far, far away.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys? 
[00:06:00]  What's happening?  Why are you whispering?  I'm going to be waking up my girlfriend with a good old rock scream.  Oh, he's doing a double.  He's combining the two.  That's pretty cool.  All right.  I bet I'm not calling from far away.  All right.  Are you walking into the bedroom?  Make sure we can hear her.  Oh. 
[00:06:30]  Hope you got that one, Al.  Oh, what did she curse?  We didn't hear her curse, though, there, Kevin.  You kind of beeped it out yourself with the rock scream.  Yeah.  She called me an S-ed.  Oh, really?  Okay.  See, if you're going to do this, somehow we've got to get the phone near the chick.  So we can hear her wake up.  That's the key to this whole bit. 
[00:07:00]  We would have heard your rock scream in the background.  Right.  So you should have put the phone, and that's what I was trying to get you to do before you  went into your rock scream.  Put the phone near the person that's being woken up, put it near them, and then do whatever  you're doing to wake them up.  We want to hear their reaction, not what you're doing.  See, we need you guys to be like little producers out there.  You got to produce your little phone call for optimum effect.  Kevin.  Yes.  What's going on now?  She went to the bathroom. 
[00:07:30]  I'm not too happy.  Ah.  All right.  I think I'm going to give you a C today.  You are an S-head.  Yeah.  The rock scream was fantastic, but we couldn't hear her, so it kind of takes away from the  whole wake up your spouse Tuesday thing.  Yeah.  If he would have called just for rock scream, he'd have been probably a B.  I gave him the C for that, but he went for a combo platter there.  Yeah.  But he had a funny line, though.  He did have a funny line.  Did you catch that one out?  He did.  He had a good one there.  All right.  I'll give him a C minus, then, for the funny line.  Well, no, you gave him a C.  I'd bump.  I know.  I know. 
[00:08:00]  That's what I'm doing.  I'd bump the whole performance up to a C.  I'm giving him a C.  A C?  All right.  A C.  Because the rock scream was really good.  The wake up, not that good at all.  Funny line.  Extra credit.  Actually failing at the wake up part, because we don't hear her waking up.  See, this is radio.  Yeah.  He knows he woke her up.  We don't know.  We don't know.  That she woke up.  So you're giving him an F on the wake up.  F.  Wow.  But a good solid B on the rock scream.  Okay.  And then he came back with a nice line after he messed up the whole thing. 
[00:08:30]  Extra credit for the line.  I bump it up to a C.  I give him a passing grade there, C.  All right.  I said C.  He said very harsh.  Yeah, we are.  It's early.  If we don't grade these people harshly, they will take it for granted.  Right.  But he didn't know that he wouldn't yell.  He should have put the phone near her.  He should have known that.  You've got to produce your phone call.  Exactly.  We're not there to do everything for you.  You've got to know how to produce your own phone call.  Right.  Produce your call.  We're just trying to produce our radio show.  You've got to produce the phone call.  Oh, no.  What's up with the space shuttle Endeavor? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, boy.  They're showing gouges all over this thing.  Oh, no.  Oh, see, that's the hole that might be a problem.  Huh?  Well, have they fixed the hole in the space shuttle Endeavor?  You know, they're doing other stuff.  Yeah.  They're just, you know, doing what they were supposed to go up there for.  They'll think about it later.  It's like when you get somewhere to a party and your car breaks down right in front of  the house.  Yeah.  And you're like, ah, I'm going to go to the party.  I'll worry about it later.  I need a few beers, a couple burgers.  I'll worry how I get home later.  I'm going to socialize a little bit and then I'll change the transmission. 
[00:09:30]  And if my car burns up in the atmosphere, screw it.  At least I have some fun.  Got some things done.  You think they're just on the space shuttle going, oh, God.  It's got to be hard to concentrate on your work when you're thinking, I could burn up  on the way home.  Yeah.  This is great.  Spatial Endeavor.  Stupid spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  See, Jimmy's laughing.  He hasn't even heard the phone call yet.  We got to play the phone call for you a little later, Jimmy.  I didn't know what that guy was saying until yesterday when you actually said Endeavor. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Spatial Endeavor.  Well, for fun fact, Friday, Friday, he decides that he's going to give us a fun fact.  And he talked about the fact that the space shuttle Endeavor was built with parts used  from the space shuttle Atlantis.  Atlantis.  Excuse me.  And every time we would try to talk to him, we'd go, excuse me, excuse me.  What I'm saying is, and then we kept quizzing him on.  You want to hear this?  On what he was talking about.  We got it.  All right. 
[00:10:30]  I think we played it this time, last time we played it, which is a radio no-no.  At least get a little bit of it in.  But Jimmy hasn't heard this yet.  This is the phone call from Andrew, I think, from Brooklyn.  Yes.  Andrew from Brooklyn.  Here it is.  Let's go to Brooklyn.  It's Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  I have a fun fact, too.  Yeah.  So I'm on the space shuttle Endeavor.  Um, you know, the space shuttle Endeavor, you know, the part that the, the space shuttle  Endeavor was actually, was actually built. 
[00:11:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The, the what?  Spatial Endeavor.  The, uh.  The space shuttle Endeavor.  All right, wait.  It's, uh, hold on.  There's something wrong with the phones.  Uh, Andrew, right?  Yes.  All right.  Andrew from Brooklyn?  Yes.  Okay, you're on the air.  What's up?  Um, space shuttle Endeavor.  Um, that space, that spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger.  And the, something about the Challenger.  Andy. 
[00:11:30]  I can't hear him.  What, what, you can't hear him either?  What ship, uh, was built for the, to replace it?  I said, Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  Challenger.  Great.  Special Endeavor.  That guy's great.  Isn't he fantastic?  All I want to do is listen to him.  That's special Endeavor.  Apparently so did we.  It went on for 20 minutes.  But, it continued there.  That was just a warm up.  You're going to have to start over. 
[00:12:00]  Sorry.  Start over.  Sorry, Andrew.  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  Um, the space shuttle Endeavor, the, the show that replaced Challenger Endeavor was actually  built with spare parts from the shuttles Discovery and Atlantis that were left over when they  were finished build.  From, from, they were finished build.  The Atlantis?  No, I said, Spatial Endeavor.  It's the spare parts. 
[00:12:30]  The parts that were used to build it.  Excuse me.  Yes.  The, um, the parts that they used to build the space shuttle Endeavor came from...  He said it again.  Spatial, Spatial Endeavor.  By the way, we got to play the third clip and I'll tell you why.  Because I was listening to this, uh, over the weekend.  And stupid Bob Kelly ruined the whole bit.  Did he?  Because near the end of this clip you'll hear Bob Kelly go, say it clearly.  Or speak something. 
[00:13:00]  No, you dummy.  And then, then he finally says, space shuttle Endeavor.  Perfectly.  He ruined it.  And a bit.  We could have done this for like, you know us, we could have done this for a half hour.  We've still been doing it.  Listen, this drove me nuts over the weekend.  Because I'm like, why did this end?  And then I realized Bob Kelly goes, speak clearly or something like that.  And the guy was on to us and said it perfectly.  Listen.  Sum it up.  So, uh, the, the, the what?  Replace the what? 
[00:13:30]  With the what?  Endeavor replaced challenge...  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Space shuttle Endeavor.  Right.  And...  The material that they used...  Yeah.  ...to build special endeavor...  ...were walkovers...  ...from the challenge...  I can't get it now.  ...from discovery at Atlantis.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wow.  So, the space, uh, shuttle in, in... 
[00:14:00]  What did he say?  Endeavor?  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  What is it?  Special Endeavor.  What is it again?  Say, you gotta be clear, dude, and say it loud.  Yeah.  Space shuttle Endeavor.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that, uh...  Well, it is fun fact there.  You mush mouth.  We all, uh, we all learned something from Andrew in Brooklyn.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  So you notice how right away we had to go, all right, thanks, Andrew.  Thanks for that.  Bit over.  Bit over.  Thanks, Bob Kelly. 
[00:14:30]  Speak clear.  Why would you want him to speak clear?  The whole bit was for this to go on forever.  Bob Kelly couldn't be dumber.  Dumber.  Why would you tell the guy to speak clear?  Stoop up Kelly.  Stoop up Kelly.  And the things to say that is probably the last thing you want to say to the guy.  The reason he's on the phone is that he can't speak clearly.  And the longer it goes, the better it gets.  Bob is made from the parts of a sea lion.  Corpus.  Without flippers.  Without flippers. 
[00:15:00]  We're having so much fun.  And then he goes, speak clear.  And then he says it, and we're like, all right, thanks for that.  Oh, well.  Thanks for the fun fact.  I guess time to move on.  You know, you should punish, Bob.  You should have shaved, like, the remaining body hair he has, and then taken his nude body  and covered it in warm oil, and then everybody just bullwhipped him until he passed out.  A good bullwhipping.  So there you go.  Now, Jimmy, you're on board.  That dude, that guy's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  Special endeavor.  Maybe if he's listening, he could give us a call today.  Andrew from Brooklyn.  He's a star.  He's a star in the making. 
[00:15:30]  Special endeavor.  I have to say quickly, I'm tired of the kiss that the soldier gave the nurse.  I don't care who it is.  Enough.  Enough.  Every 10 years or so, they drag this story out, and it's a big story.  It's the big anniversary of the kiss.  Is it?  Yes.  Every morning, I'm subjected to this stupid kiss.  Because they're trying to figure it out.  They're trying to figure out if they found the guy.  Do you see the...  And it looks like they have found the guy.  Good.  Good for him, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Let him kiss a shotgun like that, so I don't have to look at him anymore.  Enough of this guy.  It was a big moment for our country, though, the kiss.  It was very moving.  I don't know.  I think the big moment was a couple weeks prior.  The big moment was the celebration.  When those two mushroom clouds billowed up into the atmosphere.  No, only one was needed.  One was just for good measure.  One was a fine.  Hey, look.  We don't just have one of these.  We got two, and storage is expensive.  And we can build another real quick.  Just in case you think we used our only one.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, boy, were you mistaken.  Well, that deserves a kiss in the end.  Yes.  War is over.  Come here, doll.  It's wonderful.  Sure, we barbecued a nation, but let's kiss.  The mushroom clouds have barely gone away.  They've barely dispersed into the atmosphere.  But I want a kiss from you.  Who knows what type of radioactive cloud is circling the globe.  We can be sprinkled with radiation as we speak.  Just have a lucky.  It protects against radiation. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, we didn't take that into consideration now, did we?  No, we didn't care.  That the earth was going to rotate, and eventually we were going to be in the middle of that graph.  That's right.  We had to win the war.  We dropped one.  Oh, still moving.  Drop another.  I wish I could do the voice.  Let's kiss for the shadow people.  Yes, kiss for the people that shadows are burnt onto the sides of bridges.  Wonderful.  Let's get a home in Levittown and reflect how we barbecued a nation. 
[00:17:30]  Why didn't we celebrate that this year?  Huh?  There wasn't a big celebration of the dropping of the A-bombs, was it?  Because it was a weird year.  Oh, it's an off year?  What year was it again?  Only celebrate the big ones.  45?  Yeah, so what?  62 years ago?  46, what?  45.  40.  August.  Yes.  40.  40.  All right.  I'm going to go with 40.  I think last year was a big one, wasn't it?  No, two years.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  Let's go with 45.  So 62 years.  Yeah, 62.  That's not worth celebrating.  We'll go with 65, though.  Huh?  Did the Japanese take the day off?  They probably don't celebrate it in Japan.  No, they don't celebrate that.  They usually have a somber day of, like, reflection and the whole no nukes thing, and then people  protest that we were the only nation to ever use nukes against another nation.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was different times.  It was World War II, for God's sake.  But we gave them a great infrastructure.  Yeah.  We got the best infrastructure in the world now because of us. 
[00:18:30]  We were also the only nation.  They had to start from scratch.  We were also the only nation to ever end a war like that.  Lickety split.  Boy, dude, you've never seen a more definitive end to anything.  We certainly didn't want that one dragging on any longer.  We will never surrender.  All right, you got us.  Wow.  That was impressive.  August 6th, 1945.  That's right, because it was April 45 that, well, you know, the Fuhrer, that whole thing 
[00:19:00]  ended.  He died, yeah.  I'm sorry.  So then, you know, a few months later, we were like, hey, let's not drag this out.  Concentrate all our efforts in Japan, and let's get rid of that.  Can I ask a question really fast?  We're looking at live traffic here in New York.  I know you're somewhere else listening, but there's a van blocking two lanes because he's  on some weird angle.  Why the hell wouldn't he get out of his stupid van and push it to the side, and that would 
[00:19:30]  automatically free up a lane?  Does he think he's that important because his car broke down on an angle?  Why wouldn't you get out of your van and maybe go, hey, hey, someone help me push this to  this lane, and then everyone else could get through.  Nobody would help him.  No one helps.  That's the idiot who stopped behind him.  They'd all just honk.  I'm thinking he should push it himself.  I'm thinking while he was still rolling, he should have pulled off to one side, maybe. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, but he's on an angle.  Get a half a lane.  Just blocking two lanes today.  He's blocking like the ass.  Parks his vet in the parking lot.  Yeah, yeah.  Taking up two spots.  Those cars get spit on.  Keyed.  Back in the day, keyed on.  Keyed.  You think you're cool where you take up two spots in a parking lot.  If I come around, something is going to be left on your car.  Park far away.  Huh?  If you want your car in a spot without other cars around it, park further away and walk  your ass to the store or whatever the parking lot you're in. 
[00:20:30]  To get a close spot and then take up two spots, you're asking for it.  Or you're asking for a car door to open up and go, wham!  Usually it's a loogie on the door.  The door handle.  The door handle.  Somebody opens it and goes, what was that, a bird?  Loogie's on the windshield.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A nice Lunger.  Hey, Lunger.  With some solid product in it.  Mmm.  Wonderful.  All right.  We're just getting started.  Lots to do today.  So I guess we failed with Wake Up Your Spouse Tuesday.  We're going to look at another one of those today. 
[00:21:00]  That one failed.  We got a couple of faraway phone calls, but we'll get to those.  Ontario, Canada!  Is he really far away?  And Hawaii.  Well, we'll find out next, okay?  There are people listening in Ontario, I believe.  Yeah, through XM.  That's not too far.  Hawaii's kind of far, huh?  I'll tell you, though, that's far away, and I don't think you could get us on broadcast  or a satellite.  Or the internet, because there's a lot of water in the way.  No, the internet, you could get us, absolutely.  No, they don't have the internet yet in Hawaii.  They've got to tune in to the Hawaii frequency.  Wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[00:21:30]  Wow, wow.  No, they've got their own internet, but they don't have it connected to us because the water's  in the way.  What?  What happened?  What about, like, when we get them from Europe?  There's water in the way there, too.  Oh, they got, like, that, uh, the channel or something.  Oh, the channel?  Yeah, so they can put wires through the channel.  Wow.  Depending a lot on that microphone in front of you today.  People would believe you.  Why do they have interstate highways in Hawaii? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, that's one of the oldest gags in the book.  Yeah, where are you going?  They should just drive them off the end of a lava cliff.  They have no reason for the internet.  They only like his bright shirts and awful music.  We like coconuts!  And ukulele music or whatever that is.  Oh, the little guitar?  Yeah, that Don Ho guitar.  Why would you play that when you can play a regular guitar?  Because it's Hawaii, everything had to be smaller to ship over there.  Is that...  Yeah, that...  I got a microphone.  I like it.  Let's just make up stuff today. 
[00:22:30]  Let's make up stuff about Hawaii, too.  We're going to just make up stuff today, because, uh...  It's Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  Dude, we can't add anything else to the...  About Hawaii.  Make up stuff about Hawaii Tuesday.  No, no, no.  Just make up stuff about...  All right.  ...our states.  All right, if you got your scorecard at home, it's Make Up Stuff Tuesday on the O.P. Anthony  Show.  Make Up Stuff Tuesday, but you got to make it sound real.  You can't just come up with some stupid...  Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  Do you know that in Hawaii, homosexuality is mandatory?  See, that's gone a little far, Jimmy. 
[00:23:00]  It's true.  I know it's true.  That's what I'm saying.  You got to make up stuff.  Well, now...  You can't just blurt the truth out.  But for the rest of the show, the only people that are going to be in on this gag are the  ones that are listening now.  Right now.  For the rest of the show, we just make up stuff, but don't...  And then we don't acknowledge that it's Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  Oh, and then people get angry, or they try to correct us, or the listeners, because if  a listener is listening now, and he calls up and makes something up, someone's going  to call up and go, dude, that listener sucked.  That was made up.  That's fake.  And then you, the listener that's listening right now, you help us out, because someone's  going to call later and go, dude, homosexuality is not mandatory in Hawaii. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And then you will call up, and then maybe using a Wikipedia or some ridiculous thing,  you help us out.  Do we defend the listener?  Like, if a listener calls up and says something, and it's made up, because he's listening now,  and then someone calls him on it, do we go, no, dude, the guy was right?  It's Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  From this point on, whatever is said is the truth.  Okay.  Whatever is said is the truth, and we have to pretty much defend it.  Did you just make that up?  What?  Is that the truth, or is that a make-up? 
[00:24:00]  This is what Captain Kirk used to do to get to every alien.  He beat him with logic.  But if I'm lying, and everything I say is a lie, then that has to be the truth, but  I said I'm lying.  Right, right.  Love that one.  Spoke him as out of the year, isn't he?  People freak out.  Look, Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  After the break, we don't even say it's Make Up Stuff Tuesday anymore.  Just the stuff will be pouring in.  I don't understand.  And then all the people that are tuning into the radio will be scratching their head like,  wow, I'm learning a lot of weird stuff today.  Weird.  I had no idea about it.  And then they'll call and go, that can't be true. 
[00:24:30]  And then another listener will call and go, no, it really is true.  My buddy told me when he was overseas that he saw literature on blah, whatever.  Back it up with some bogus facts.  Yeah.  I don't understand why we don't even have a sweeper for this.  We will.  Within minutes.  Oh, but then if we play the sweeper.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  Hey, if Tim's going to give us a sweeper, he's got to do it within five minutes.  It's got to be before the break.  Well, no, we have to break, but maybe right after the break.  I mean, like, before the break ends.  Like, right after the break, we've got to play.  See, if we take a break in another eight to nine minutes, a lot more people are joining 
[00:25:00]  the program.  So do we let them in on it?  We're going to have to, because we have to play the sweeper.  We've got to play the sweeper.  All right.  If he has one in time.  He better have one in time.  It's Makeup Stuff Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Well, we've got a sweeper.  That means it's official.  All right.  I knew it.  It's Makeup Stuff Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:25:30]  That's it?  That is it.  But he didn't make anything up and add it in.  He didn't have time.  Because this is the last time we mention it for today, that it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  He should have said something like, it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday, and this is the last pro  I'm ever making.  And that would have been like making something up.  And that would have been it right there, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So now we've got to make up something really good.  Okay.  And then we've got to go with it for the rest of the morning.  And we're not going to tell people it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday. 
[00:26:00]  So if you're listening now, you're in on the gag.  People like tune into the program as the morning goes along, obviously.  Someone's saying, why don't we say, Cigarette Sam is saying, Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  Let's report the mayor of Boston is...  Hey, hey, hey.  Why don't we leave that alone?  Hey, hey, hey.  All right.  Steve is straight.  I laughed a little too hard at that one.  Sorry, Steve.  Hey, it's also Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:26:30]  I mentioned that because we're getting lots of requests for the Terry Schiavo one that  was made by one of the fine listeners.  This is really, really good and twisted and wrong and just not right.  Hey, this isn't it.  Wow.  It is confused every clip we play Tuesday.  Why would you hand me this?  Why, Iraq?  I wanted a Terry Schiavo and you hand me this.  What'd you hand him, Eric?  Why did you do that?  You know, Iraq's IQ could get him into Mensa. 
[00:27:00]  Seriously, I mean it.  Why would I want that when I'm begging for...  Aw, look at his eyes.  He gets all puppy dog when his hero yells at him.  Oh, don't make that face at Opie when he turns his head.  Whatever.  It's Makeup Stuff.  All right, here we go.  What did you call him?  I called him Mumps Neck.  Why are you calling him Mumps Neck?  Mumps Neck.  Oh, no.  He's got a sore throat today and he's just got a swollen throat area.  He certainly does. 
[00:27:30]  His throat is sore from having fish lobbed into his mouth.  I laughed a little too hard at that one, too.  Sorry, Iraq.  But now I feel better about myself.  Here's the Terry Schiavo for Rock Scream Tuesday.  She's doing a good Rock Scream. 
[00:28:00]  It's great, though.  That is really funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, what's going on with this UFO video?  Oh, my God.  Have you seen this?  I finally took a look.  It's a UFO over Haiti.  Yeah.  And some people are hanging out.  I guess there was a party going on and they're videotaping.  And then something gets the guy with the camera, gets his attention.  And two UFOs, which I mean, you can see they are obviously some type of flying craft. 
[00:28:30]  Fly right overhead and continue on their way.  And you just see it.  It's amazing.  It's some of the clearest, best footage I've ever seen of UFOs ever.  This should just break the whole UFO thing wide open.  Well, it's a...  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Look, you're seeing it?  Yeah, I see that.  Dude, we've been visited from space, from aliens. 
[00:29:00]  See, I want to...  There's no other excuse.  People are viewing this thing all over the internet.  It's...  Oh, yeah.  It is way past viral.  It's millions of views at this point.  Yeah.  Many, many different versions.  Yeah, you're looking at two UFOs clear as day.  Look at that.  They come from behind this palm tree.  Right.  And then right over the guy's head that's taping it.  He does a good job of holding the camera because a lot of times UFO footage, it's all shaky.  But he does a pretty good job of holding the camera steady, even though he must have been 
[00:29:30]  very excited to see this.  Well, there's something about seeing something very unusual that makes the camera person just  lose their minds.  You know, the Bigfoot footage comes to mind.  Ah!  They just...  Ah!  They hand the camera to Christopher Reeve.  Oh, Christopher Reeve.  Damn it.  He's dead.  Oh, Michael J. Fox!  I meant Michael J. Fox.  Damn me!  Wait, wait.  And then at the end of the video, look at this big other stupid UFO that comes in and  wait.  There's this big clunky UFO.  Hold on.  Oh, yeah.  Big clunky one.  What do you mean?  Oh, look at this awful one. 
[00:30:00]  They go away now, and then the other one comes.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's the Foundry Music logo.  Stupid Foundry logo.  Jesus, Steve.  Like it's your exclusive video?  The thing's all over the place.  If it was over your house, it would have been an unidentified phallic object.  Oh.  But I'm waiting for...  Bob.  Oh.  Take the heat off of my stupid joke.  Special Endeavor.  Oh.  Everyone's laughing at it.  It's the Special Endeavor.  But I don't know why the President hasn't commented on this. 
[00:30:30]  World leaders haven't gotten together to comment on this video, because it really confirms  that we are not alone.  Yeah.  It's fake.  What?  This is what sucks about living in this day and age.  People can make these videos now, and now it's going to confuse everybody when the real  UFOs start flying around.  See?  And no one's going to believe them.  No one's going to believe a goddamn thing.  This is so fake, but very well done, to the point where people are buying into the fact 
[00:31:00]  that this is two actual UFOs flying over Haiti.  The huge arguments going on on the sites YouTube and Break and every video site, huge arguments  going on back and forth that it's real, that it's fake.  It's fake.  It's so fake.  The whole scene is CGI'd.  But now the UFO people, now they're safe to fly around all over the United States, because  now people would be like...  Wait, wait, wait.  The UFO people?  Yeah, I don't know what they're called.  Like, we're Americans.  I don't know what the UFO people are called.  They're UFO Americans. 
[00:31:30]  They're just UFO people.  Be nice.  Words hurt.  Until we label them, they're just UFO people.  Bunch of Mars lovers.  Oh, watch your language.  Green people will come here and have us thrown off the air.  I like to call them UFO people.  These UFO nuts will argue about this.  I watched a Roswell special last night.  It was an hour I was up watching it.  And despite all the evidence that has come out against them being UFOs, and I always wanted  them to be, but it really does look like they were not UFOs. 
[00:32:00]  Some type of weather balloon.  The balloon won't stop.  No, they won't stop.  They're drawn to it like...  It was something that was used to test...  It was to monitor Soviet nuclear tests, which I do believe.  But wasn't it hoisted up by a balloon?  Yes.  Yeah.  But not a weather balloon.  Oh, okay.  It was a balloon for testing.  Yeah, it was always something about those stupid Soviets.  So they'll argue this.  No matter how much proof is given that this was CGI'd, they'll scream that it wasn't CGI'd.  Well, yeah.  The whole 9-11 thing.  Here's what you do.  That's all you have to go to, the stupid 9-11 conspiracy theory people. 
[00:32:30]  I know.  I mean, if they're convinced that we blew up the Twin Towers, of course they're going  to believe this is real.  There's another video out there on YouTube and a few of the other sites called 9-11 was  an outside job.  Right.  Instead of an inside job and some kid who doesn't do it very well.  But there's a couple of moments in there that are pretty funny.  He's talking about Building 7 coming down and he goes, this was not hit by an aircraft,  yet it fell.  He goes, I cannot understand how a building that was not hit by an aircraft can fall. 
[00:33:00]  And he switches to this picture of one of the towers coming down from another angle  on Building 7 and completely hitting the front of Building 7.  He goes, it just doesn't make any sense that this building fell down.  He could have done a better job, but there were a couple of moments in there that really  rip apart that stupid loose change thing.  But he's on to something, now someone will take his idea and really, really make it good.  But this UFO video over Haiti, getting a lot of talk on the internet. 
[00:33:30]  If you go to www.e-onsoftware.com, that's what did it.  How do you know it was this company?  I did my research last night.  And right on their front page is an example of that palm tree setting and the sunset.  And they have other examples that you can click on and see videos that this program does. 
[00:34:00]  And you'll see that this program was used for this.  You know what's funny about this UFO video over Haiti?  The poor people are going to believe it.  Of course.  The poor people are going to really believe it.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That's what it comes down to.  The poor, poor people.  They're going to think this UFO is flying over Haiti.  They'll think it was bringing the medicine and clean drinking water.  Stupid poor people will buy into it.  Right now they're all dancing on garbage, happy it's going to come back and take them somewhere special. 
[00:34:30]  Thank God.  But it's a great day for the UFO people because now they can fly around America.  People will be filming them like crazy, but then everyone will be like, ah, that's obviously CGI as well.  They, uh, yeah.  Now, some guy, think of the poor bastard that really sees a UFO now.  Yeah.  And has a great HD camera, can keep it steady, gets a great shot of a real UFO flying over his head.  And people will be like, oh, yeah, well, obviously you could tell that's fake. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, remember that Haiti video?  Yeah.  That looked good, too.  Same thing.  And it probably wouldn't look as good as the Haiti video because it's real and it's not CGI.  You know, like in the movies, stuff looks really cool that in normal life doesn't look that good.  That's what it'll be like.  It's like, oh, come on, the Haiti one's better than this.  Well, now you're going to have to just catch a UFO person and collar them.  You need, uh, yeah, aliens now.  You're going to have to catch one of them and put a dog collar on them.  Walk them around.  Until the authorities come and pick them up.  Yeah.  Uh, let's say.  Poor little fella with a big head. 
[00:35:30]  Big head, big eyes blinking.  Blink, blink.  Like, getting all dried out.  He needs gallons of Visine down here.  What are some of the comments, uh, that go along with UFO video for me?  Oh, my goodness.  Is there a lot of people buying into it?  Uh, or is it, I would imagine it would be like 75, no way, 25% yes.  Well, you go to the.  If I had to guess.  If you go to the oldest ones first, you'll get, um.  Holy crap type of.  Yeah, like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's real.  Yeah.  That was sweet.  Oh, my God.  There's some freaky stuff going on. 
[00:36:00]  Uh.  Uh, the government has all sorts of, uh, craft like that.  And then you go to the most recent ones and they've already, they're onto it.  So it's like fake, fake.  If you look closely, it's the same trees.  Hey, why are we going to go to the movies if we can make the same crap at home?  This is the same kind of effects used in the new Battlestar Galactica.  What?  Notice the same kind of zooms and off focus shots.  But, but seriously, Ant.  Yeah.  If you can make this crap at home, why would you want to go to the movies?  Why would you get excited for the next action film? 
[00:36:30]  Someone's got to write some compelling stuff to go along with it.  Yeah, but most of the stuff isn't compelling, that'd be right.  That's true.  Just a lot of car crashes.  You've got to be a computer nerd.  Hey, uh, we've got a guy that actually saw a UFO once.  It's Joe in New York.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Joe.  It's Joe in New York.  How you doing, man?  I actually saw a UFO when I was, uh, I don't know, seventh grade?  Yeah.  And I'm telling you, I didn't, it's not like I'd tell everybody, it was just me and my  friend hanging out, two, three o'clock in the morning, lying out, just, uh, talking. 
[00:37:00]  And then, uh, there must have been a hundred shooting stars that day.  Yeah.  And then we went back out in the house.  As soon as he went in, there's a UFO maybe about two, three hundred feet above our head.  Puked.  No noise, no nothing.  Nothing crazy like, uh, close encounters, but, uh.  But you saw something there.  And you have no doubt in your mind that you saw a UFO that night?  Uh, 100%.  Never doubted it in my entire life.  What about?  It was so low, it couldn't, it made no noise. 
[00:37:30]  Could not have been a helicopter.  Could not have been a plane.  It just, and then, it was so fast.  I mean, it was slow when I saw it.  I ran to call my friend.  He came out.  By the time he did, it was like 90% over the, the, the, the building.  Were there lights on it or something?  Yeah, we were, we were a two-story condo.  So it wasn't that high.  And we went around the corner running, and then it was gone.  Nothing.  And then you, you weren't able to get a camera or anything so you could get some documentation 
[00:38:00]  of this thing?  Nah, I was in seventh grade.  Seventh grade.  He'd pull out his phone camera?  Oh yeah, good point.  Or the, yeah, yeah, good point.  I'm like, uh, you know, 36 now, man.  They probably didn't even have digital cameras back then.  When, when, when you told people, did anyone, did anyone, did anyone, what did he say?  I don't know.  I was just commenting on how he kept interrupting you.  Yeah.  Did anyone, uh, believe you?  My friend did, cause he said he saw the tail end of it.  Right. 
[00:38:30]  I, I never really believed that he saw it.  I think he was just saying it because he wanted to, uh, he wanted to say he saw it.  Aw, he wanted to be a part of it.  Aw.  Yeah, yeah.  Little creepy, nice friend.  No, I told my friends and family, but that's about it.  Hmm.  You ever tell the authorities?  You ever tell anybody?  Nah, not me, you know, just really close friends.  Yeah, that's gotta suck.  Back in the day, if you saw something crazy in the sky, you couldn't film it or anything,  and then what do you do?  You tell the authorities, and they're like,  Here's what I saw.  And what are they gonna do?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  They'll call you a liar.  Yeah, thanks.  We'll, uh, we'll make a record of it.  Yeah.  All right, well, take this down, and if we got any other reports.  Right.  A kook.  Yeah.  And they got a nice coat for me, uh, straps in the front, right?  Yeah.  All right, Joe, thank you for your story today.  Yes, uh.  How awful would it be if we realized that there was another civilization so advanced that the  only aliens that come here are the dummies of that society?  They just know to bypass this crap hole.  Like, the aliens that are so advanced, like, these are the retards of their society. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  We finally see them, and they all have big heads with Pete Rose hairdos, and they've come  for our Jell-O.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  They meet with the president, and he goes, tell me about your world.  They go, ah.  Yeah, well, we're like the crappy, like the truck, like the monster truck shows of space.  Like, only the white trash and the morons come to see Earth.  It's like a bad amusement park. 
[00:40:00]  How do you know?  And like the real upper crusty aliens, they never would be seen dead here.  They go vacation somewhere else.  They go somewhere else.  Yeah.  And this is just a crap hole.  This is the giant ball of twine of the galaxy.  It's the seaside heights of the nook.  Yeah.  There you go.  Asbury Park.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Morning, boys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yes, Eric.  I heard a news story, oh, about three or four hours ago on another radio station that 
[00:40:30]  supposedly somewhere in Nevada, late yesterday afternoon, a semi hit an alien.  Wait, in Nevada?  In Nevada.  I guess it happened on, they call it the alien highway.  It runs north out of Vegas.  Yeah.  Supposedly, a truck driver was going along and he hit an alien.  I'm not talking a Mexican, the illegal alien.  I'm talking about it.  Why do they call it the alien highway? 
[00:41:00]  Because supposedly you see a lot of UFOs along this highway.  A lot of truckers, I guess, see a lot of strange stuff driving at night and everything.  So, to track the trailer, hit one, and that's just breaking now?  That story?  Well, I heard this story, like I say, about three hours ago on another radio station.  So, you know, it's probably true.  You know, I don't know.  Well, if anyone else has anything on this, please give the show a call.  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:41:30]  We'll start Googling and see what we can find out on this.  Did you hear that they had captured an alien?  Thank you, Eric.  They captured one.  Apparently, like, he slipped in the milk aisle of a path mark and hurt his knee.  And he said, I'm from another world, and he's now suing.  All right, we've got to take a break.  A lot of UFO calls coming in now.  Yes.  I don't know what that's about.  Or Art Bell.  Hey, by the way, the UFO video over Haiti, Al will definitely link that on his show rundown. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, who hasn't seen it?  My God.  92.3 KROQ.com.  Go to the Opie and Anthony page, and Al Dukes does a nice show rundown every day.  And he adds all these links of the things we're talking about.  So this link will definitely be up there today, okay?  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I've just been handed another sweeper. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  He's slightly behind.  But he doesn't know what we're talking about at any given time.  It's an official alien sighting.  Hey.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we got one of those today.  There's a story coming out of what, Colorado?  An official alien sighting.  Well, it's official if it's on our show.  Yeah.  A little story coming out of Colorado we're trying to get to the bottom of. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Some trucker may have hit an alien last night.  It's on the road that runs up to Area 51.  Yeah, they call it Alien Highway.  Yeah.  And apparently an alien was struck  on the highway.  The extraterrestrial highway, I believe it's called.  Route 375.  There you go.  We're getting a little more info as we move along here.  Hey, we're getting lots of requests for that news clip  of the news anchor laughing. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  And not the one you know and love from this show, you know.  Muttley.  Snidely Whiplash and Muttley.  Your anchors.  Those are professionals.  Jesus.  You know, I was thinking about that clip.  We've probably have played that over a hundred times.  Yeah.  And it's still not old.  It's their laughs.  It's just, I can still listen to that. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you, Ray.  No, it's the new one that came in yesterday,  just in case you weren't listening yesterday,  at that horrific truck accident.  Yeah, this story just gets worse and worse  as he keeps telling it.  Yeah.  And he just can't hold it in.  And for some reason, he starts cracking up.  The guy's out of Nebraska.  It's Jay Warren of WSLS.  A fire crash leaves three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say a rental truck  carrying two people lost control,  crossed the median,  and collided head-on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, 
[00:44:30]  and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me.  The two people in the real...  The two people in the real truck  and the driver of the semi...  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  Where a crew said they had fires contained  in about ten minutes.  My favorite part is,  the two people in the real...  Two people in the real...  He can't even continue.  He's just gonna stop dead in his tracks. 
[00:45:00]  What an ass.  Can you explain what happened?  We're still trying to find out.  No one knows.  Did someone drop a gasser  right before that story came up?  Now that's something that could have happened.  Maybe it was the otters holding hands  right before.  Crash of the day on the cross island.  Yeah, so...  Wow.  Hopefully one of the otters  will fall with that.  Oh, that's gotta hurt.  Well, we talked about this a while ago.  When you do morning radio...  Yeah.  You get to see Crash of the Day.  Mm-hmm.  It's one of the first stories  they do every morning.  It's some horrific car accident 
[00:45:30]  on your highways.  And they love to show it.  And by the time most people  are awake and watching the news,  they've already moved on to the news,  and they've cleaned up the accident site.  Damn another Long Island home invasion.  I hate these.  Why aren't they at my house?  You want them to break into your house?  Ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho.  They'll...  The last thing they would think of is,  oh my God, this was the mistake  we were talking about  that we shouldn't have made.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Because you gotta figure.  So why don't you just get...  When some guy is doing a home invasion, right? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  He's like doing it,  and then they run out,  do whatever they do in there,  terrorize, murder, even,  or just rob property,  whatever they're doing.  And then they leave and go,  God, this is so easy.  This is so easy.  We just go in, we do this.  But when all of a sudden  they see that flash  from the business end of a shotgun,  that last thought's gotta be,  oh damn, I picked the wrong house.  I got a great idea.  Oh damn, yes.  Great idea.  What?  Give out your address. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Watch the action ensue.  Watch the war start.  Yes.  No.  No.  Get it over with.  No.  You wanna shoot an intruder so bad,  why don't you just get it  out of your system?  Nope.  I don't want to shoot an intruder.  Oh, you...  Oh, you're...  If there was one in my house,  I would do what I have to do.  Your trigger finger  is getting very itchy.  I would do what I have to do  in compliance with the laws  of using deadly physical force. 
[00:47:00]  That is what I would do, my friend.  But I'm just thinking  of the mindset there.  That's gotta be kind of a...  Oh, we've done this so many times  and never had a problem  and now, look,  any minute now,  I'm just gonna have  the shotgun loads  just go right through me.  I see that flash.  And their last thought  would probably be,  why am I hearing  German marching music?  It's four in the morning.  He probably flips a switch. 
[00:47:30]  I'm just being shot by Himmler.  His first thing is  he jumps out of bed,  flips a switch,  so there's just German  marching music  all over his house  and then he runs  for the shotgun.  Time for action!  You're insane.  Ready for action.  You're absolutely insane.  That...  You actually looked  at the TV  and you were bummed  that they weren't  near your neighborhood.  No, I feel bad  for the families.  I feel bad  for families  that don't take  these things seriously  and arm  and defend themselves.  Yeah.  Arm and defend yourselves 
[00:48:00]  because you know damn well  when they're tying you up  with that phone cord  and ready to ravage  your wife or daughter,  the one thing  you're thinking is  I would love  to watch this guy's head  explode like a watermelon  at the end  of my shotgun.  That's absolutely  what they're thinking.  But you don't have one.  Now you gotta sit there  and hope for their mercy.  Screw you.  I'm shooting first.  Do we have  Anthony's Neighborhood Music  all queued up  and ready to go?  On what?  See, but you live here. 
[00:48:30]  Nothing happens here.  It's a wonderfully  quiet neighborhood.  Nothing happens here.  Surrounded by people  that are Jews.  I love my Jewish neighbors.  I love them.  I'm surrounded by them.  All over the place.  Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.  And you know  they're watching out for you.  They watch out.  They're watching  the whole neighborhood.  You don't even have  to blink an eye.  You know what?  Some communities call it  Community Watch.  Right.  My neighborhood,  we call it Busy Bodies. 
[00:49:00]  But they have the same result.  They're peering out  their windows.  They're looking,  seeing who's there  and who shouldn't be around.  And they, you know,  get things done.  They call up.  Can I raise my hand?  And it's wonderful.  I'm raising my hand.  Meticulously manicured lawns.  Yes.  But could you use the word  ogling?  They're oogling.  Oh, is it ogling?  Oogle, ogle, ogle.  I say ogle.  They're doing all three.  Well, I know how to,  I know how to like  write it in a crossword. 
[00:49:30]  Is that good enough?  You can't pass by  one of my neighbors.  Yeah.  In your vehicle  without them looking at you.  Like they look at you like,  who are you  and do you belong here?  And believe me,  they have a system  for knowing  just at a glance  if you belong  in the neighborhood  or you don't belong  in the neighborhood.  I'm not sure  what this system is.  I'm not privy to it yet.  But I know  that in my neighborhood  my Jewish neighbors  that are all around  my neighborhood  all have a system 
[00:50:00]  because they've lived  there longer than me.  So they could just  by looking  know  if someone belongs  in that neighborhood  or doesn't.  All right.  If he appears  to be a potty-mouthed  Italian,  maybe.  Well,  I would think  if some Italians  moved in  there would probably  be a problem.  Not me.  When are they going  to try to get you  out of the neighborhood?  When are you guessing?  When are they going  to get brave enough  to go,  all right,  look,  we got to get together  and get this guy out.  I think they look at me  like some kind 
[00:50:30]  of a freak show.  I'm some kind  of anomaly  they could live with.  You got them  all scared.  You'll leave  in the middle of the night.  You leave  in the middle of the night  and you come home  by like noon  and you live  in a really nice house.  They're like,  man,  he's doing something  illegal.  I'm not sure  if they,  yeah.  Oh,  here comes  the drug dealer.  Maybe they don't know  they think I'm dealing  or an organized crime.  Here comes  the drug dealer.  Here comes  that Italian  and you know  what they're all into?  Organized crime.  Dude,  you should like  make videos.  Oy vey.  You just leave 
[00:51:00]  it in the morning  by just piling shovels  in the back  of your truck  and rolled up  carpets,  carpets,  shovels,  and lime.  Lime and shovels.  Yeah,  then at noon  you just unload  your shovels,  your carpet,  and your lime.  Make sure to make  a little noise.  Like drop some stuff  and go,  oh,  hey,  what are you doing?  I'll go dropping  the shovels.  You see some lights  click on around  the neighborhood  and the curtains  open up  and they're like,  what are they doing? 
[00:51:30]  Harvey,  what's going on  out there?  I don't know  but it doesn't look good.  Yeah,  because you know  there's some people  in your neighborhood  they know who you are  but there's others  they're trying to figure out  they're like,  he leaves at like  4.30 in the morning  comes home by noon?  He's putting a rolled up  carpet in the back  of his truck.  What is this?  Oh,  hey!  And then just  kind of look at him  look at him real quick  and notice that  I see him looking  they close the shades  close them quickly  oh my goodness 
[00:52:00]  who should we call  the police?  Don't call them  don't get involved  you should have  club soda candy  just for a goof  like walk your perimeter  for like a week straight  just walk around  the property  just walk around  the property  just looking at people  sideways  just slowly walking  the perimeter  for a week straight  no,  they'd water his head  thinking it was  a patch of bad lawn  a retarded scarecrow  and by the way  the neighbors  scared dope  the neighbors already  don't like you 
[00:52:30]  they want to  who's the odd man  in the new home  that gave the children  Deutschmarks for Halloween  they loved him  hey,  we went off on  a little tangent there  but I was talking about  the otters holding hands  we played the news clip  of the guy laughing  yeah  and you said  why is this guy laughing  I'm saying  maybe they played  the cute video  of the otters  holding hands  right before the dumb  you know  but that's not funny  truck crash  or entertaining  but it's got  7 million  over 7 million hits  well we went to 
[00:53:00]  the otters  holding hands thing  because the  the UFO over Haiti  on one side alone  has what  1.5 million views  something like that  closing in  closing in fast  to 1.5  and then we're like  what is wrong  in America  and then we  then  the fan points out  that the otters  holding hands video  which is beyond viral  has 7.7 million views  and it's the most  boring video  when I first heard of it  I thought there was  going to be something  exciting  I don't know  like the otters  are holding hands 
[00:53:30]  and a predator  some type of  killer whale perhaps  I don't know  comes up and  bats him 50 feet  in the air  and then swallows  him whole  yeah  that would have  been good  but as this video  goes on  you realize  it is two otters  on their back  holding hands  just kind of  circling in this pool  and that's it  and humans like to see  this because they're  thinking wow  they got some of  this human stuff  in their little  otter brains  they're adorable  and they're holding  hands because  they're having  a relationship  no it's two otters  that just happen  to get tangled up  and they were too  lazy to untangle  as they're floating 
[00:54:00]  on their backs  that's it  that's all it is  I'd like to jump  in that water  with my elbow  and give it to  both of those  otters across  their chests  that big fat  otter belly  yeah  I want to pat it  I just want to  pat it like  see look  it would go  with smack  because it's all wet  they just  they just unattached  that's it  they were floating  and they unattached  that's all it was  they weren't holding  hands  why are people  watching this video  because it's  what they call  adorable  no it's not  girls like it  you know what 
[00:54:30]  that otter  should be holding  a plugged in  toaster  I like to give  those otters  a nice  plugged in  toaster  have some  toast otters  Iraq you have  the worst timing  ever  I don't even  think you're awake  when we do this  radio show  Dan goes  quickly and points  to the screen  like look  something's happening  in the otter  holding hands  video  and at that  moment  Iraq decides  to scroll  down to  read comments  and when you  missed the  Iraq if you  were actually  looking at the  video was the  one otter  reaching out  to hold  other otters  hand 
[00:55:00]  oh it reached  back out for  him  see here it is  in slow motion  oh  grabbing  oh that's  adorable  oh boy  now there's  something going  on there  what's going  on there  why are they  holding hands  must be some  kind of thing  they do just  to float  survival thing  sharks don't  eat them  nothing to do  with  by the way  it's two male  otters  one's tucked  a couple of  Hawaiian otters  little known fact  about that video 
[00:55:30]  it's two male  otters  one's noticing  that one has  a wide back  two otter robes  alright here's  your news  really really  fast  still no sign  of the miners  they're so  dead  they're so  dead  now  some people  are insisting  and especially  the mine  manager  the guy that  runs the  joint  that there's  still a chance  that they  could be alive  and they're  drilling a  third what  hole  why aren't  they drilling  like five  holes at the  same time  why isn't  the whole  miner  community 
[00:56:00]  getting together  and getting  all their  drills out  and drilling  like five  holes at a  time in  five areas  where they  might be  because I  heard they  drilled like  two holes  and it took  a hell of a  long time  they drop a  camera down  and realize  they're not  we're gonna  drill a third  hole in an  area where they were 
[00:56:30]  they still have  a sense of  humor after all  that time and  just drop a  hog through  all right  they're okay  I got Carl  Rove there  stepping down  at the end of  the month  whatever  say he wants  to spend  more time  with his  family  Bush has  17 months  left  how bad  do you want  to be around  your family  you can't  wait a year  and five  months  that is the  universal excuse  for something's  up get out  how fun is  your family  I want to  spend more  time with  my family  no you  don't  he wants  to get  out early 
[00:57:00]  the approval  rating is  just horrendous  and  Bush wants  to leave  he'd like to  just say  I want to  spend more  time with  my family  where are you  going  I was reading  in the paper  yesterday that  Bush is on  track to take  more time  than anyone  else  vacation time  vacation time  I haven't  seen him do  anything  what was the  last thing he  did  that didn't  involve like  the speeches  about the war  what was the  last thing he  actually did  there's all the  things you can  do  as president  yeah  like you'd  always see the 
[00:57:30]  president with  the pen  take the pen  he'd have the  pen and he'd be  like signing  bills and  things that's  what he does  he'd sign  things and  then he'd sign  it with a bunch  of pens and  then they'd clap  and he'd hand  the pens out  and there's  some other  leader next  to him or  somebody and  he's signing  things I never  see Bush doing  that yeah you  never see him  doing anything  nothing's getting  passed they just  kind of every  everybody's doing  nothing they can't  get along anymore  because the  Democrats and  Republicans are  completely divided  and he just it's 
[00:58:00]  it's speeches about  the war it's all  we get and more  bodies and not  enough aggressive  tactics over there  too many rules to  abide by you know  what those poor  bastards that one  one guy gets shot  by the sniper and  they lure five more  soldiers into a  booby-trapped house  and blow the house  up now how the hell  is things like that  happening we should  be carpet bombing  well they have robot  technology though  lots of robots I  saw the video  robots they're 
[00:58:30]  working on the  robot thing now for  predators to fight  the wars predators  flying up there and  then they got the  robots on the ground  robot holding the  rifle but can't you  just hold the little  robots arms if you're  in that area got to  get up to the robot  first and you think  the technology is good  enough where there's  no way you get close  to the robot you got  a robot with machine  guns on it I'm  thinking wow up behind  the robot grab its  little robot arms  up then what then  what sneak up on  him or just push it  over how's it gonna  get back up you don't  drop him in while with 
[00:59:00]  a parachute behind  enemy lines you head  you point him towards  the enemy throw water  on him watch him  rust just stops at  the tin man watch  you go over rock and  just fall over on its  side then what then  what then what  happens I don't know  what do we got on  Karl Rove that you  had a little fact  about him there a  factoid oh yeah that  his father I don't  know if it was his  natural father I don't  have the paper open  to where it should be  but it says here he  was biological father  abandoned the family  and he had an adoptive 
[00:59:30]  father and I think  his adoptive father  announced he was gay  in 1970 divorced his  wife and she committed  suicide in 81  hey that'll that'll  keep you stable  but when you think  of how like anti-gay  the Bush administration  is and like how many  apparent tie-ins they  have like with Cheney's  daughter yeah his I  guess I was adoptive  father it's a bit  hypocritical yeah it's  silly hmm maybe there's  probably a better  political term than  silly I think that  might be why they're so  against it you know 
[01:00:00]  because his adopted  father pretty much in  his mind may have been  responsible for the  death of his mom all  right right so he might  not like the gay people  just for the heck of it  what's your name sir  Peter Fitzgerald all right  thank you mr.  road oh Patrick Fitzgerald  Patrick Fitzgerald all right  what we just want to ask  you some questions about

Well, this is why America's Funniest Home Videos did so well, too,  because this is pretty much a bunch of animal clips.  Right, right.  Doing wacky things.  Yeah, well, this is what we like in America.  You know what it would be a funny cat clip?  Funny cats.  The cat get creepy Oscar the cat just sleeping on an old person as they aspire.  That would be a funny cat clip.  As he dozes off and they put a toe tag on the old thing and drag it out. 
[01:05:30]  Funny cats.  13.3 million views.  Hey, when we get back, can we do a tribute to Brooke Astor?  I know our listeners really have a soft spot for her.  For Brooke Astor.  The old socialite who died at 105.  Yes.  Jeez.  We also got to get into the Van Halen announcement.  Yes, that's huge.  And we want to start a new contest.  Yes.  Guess what city the meltdown will happen.  We got some audio from their press conference. 
[01:06:00]  Where the tour ends with fisticuffs.  We should guess what city the meltdown happens.  Let's get the tour.  Wait, should we break it up into what city Eddie starts drinking in again?  Right.  And then what city...  Fisticuffs start.  Fisticuffs start.  And which city just the tour ends.  Yeah.  So drinking, punching, the tour's over.  Yeah.  Let's get into that as well after the break.  And Vince McMahon, his storyline is just terrific.  What now? 
[01:06:30]  Another wrestler died overnight.  I'm MC Roe.  Chocolate ring.  We lost another wrestler, Crush.  Crush.  And Vince McMahon was too busy with his new storyline where he has his daughter, Stephanie McMahon,  telling his father, Vince, that his illegitimate kid is a WWE superstar.  Oh, I hope it ain't Crush.  His illegitimate kid is a superstar?  A WWE superstar. 
[01:07:00]  Stupid, Vince.  We love stupid heads, though.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're heading to D.C. for Friday's show.  The day before the ONA traveling virus hits Washington, D.C.  Or actually the Washington, D.C. area.  We're actually playing in Virginia.  Yes.  At the Nissan Pavilion.  What do the people need to know if they want to, like, see us live there, Jimmy? 
[01:07:30]  Well, if they want to see us, come in and see the studio.  There's a limited amount of seats.  We're going to be doing car crash comedy.  So email live at xmradio.com.  And in the subject line, put Opie and Anthony.  And with Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez, I'm doing Unmasked that night.  So if you want to come to that, again, there's about 50 seats available.  Live at xmradio.com.  And in the subject, put Jim Norton Unmasked.  So, you know, you'll be able to get into at least one of those, hopefully, or possibly not both. 
[01:08:00]  But make sure you email because it's the only way to do it.  Yeah, absolutely.  Limited seating, folks.  And tickets are going really, really well for all three of the final venues.  Yeah, yeah.  So tickets are still available for Saturday's ONA Trial and Virus Comedy Show.  Eight or nine comedians, you know, from the show.  You've got your ONA Village.  You've got the tailgating.  It's an all-day event.  We're very excited.  We haven't done a big event in Washington, D.C., I think, ever.  And I've broadcasted live there a couple times over the years. 
[01:08:30]  But this is the first big event.  And I screwed up.  Car Crash Comedy, we're going to be doing it in the studio.  But to contact for Car Crash Comedy, you don't have to send one of those general emails.  This is Sam at FoundryMusic.com.  So anyone who's doing Car Crash Comedy, I think, will be able to get in, or hopefully.  Yes, Ben?  The Sam address is if you want to participate as a comedian in Car Crash Comedy.  Okay.  Not if you wanted seats.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, no, no.  I meant as a comedian.  Oh, now it's all confusing for everybody.  Sam at FoundryMusic.com. 
[01:09:00]  If you want to be a Car Crash Comedy comedian and hopefully win a spot like that little fella did in Philly.  Well, I got a call from Kid Chris, but I wasn't able to return his call yesterday.  Kid Chris, of course, works at WISP.  Indeed.  In Philly.  And that little fella wants to back out.  He's panicking.  So Kid Chris wanted me to call the show yesterday and give him some business.  Business.  Why would you panic?  It's a great opportunity.  What do you want to do?  Open mic night for the rest of your life?  Stop.  You get to go in front of... 
[01:09:30]  He's going early, so probably a few thousand people easily.  I'll tell you why he's panicking.  He's two feet tall.  He's never had free sex in his life.  He has to panic.  Do we have his number?  Can we get him on the show today?  Do we still have that guy's number?  We met him down in Philly when we were broadcasting live, and he was the first winner of Car Crash Comedy.  He's a little fella who has to pay for sex, and he goes to massage parlors all the time.  And he was hilarious.  And we gave him the opening spot when we hit the Philly area for the tour, and now he's backing out. 
[01:10:00]  I thought he would have done good.  Yeah.  I think he would do well.  They would like him.  I don't know what his deal is.  We've got to get to the bottom of it and see if we can help him out.  Hey, we've got to play this clip again because we've got some info, finally.  A fire crashed.  There's three people dead.  Dead police in Nebraska say a rental truck carrying two people lost control, crossed the median, and collided head-on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me.  The two people in the real truck and the driver of the semi. 
[01:10:30]  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  We're killing crews.  They had fires contained in about 10 minutes.  He's like, he's trying to talk to himself.  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  Like, what's he telling us?  Yeah.  Well, we finally got an explanation.  We got Sean from Tennessee on the SFV back.  Opie, the TV station with the laughing anchor, released a statement saying that the anchor was laughing because a staffer made rabbit ears behind one of the cameraman's head, and the staffer has been released from his duties. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, my goodness.  For making rabbit ears?  That old gag can still get you in trouble?  Who laughs at that gag?  How old is that?  I know.  Who's laughing like a retard over the rabbit ears?  How goody-coos-shoes is your work environment where that gets you to laugh during a murder story?  Rabbit ears?  Yeah, rabbit ears.  I'd spend on somebody for that.  Well, that's ridiculous.  What else is America talking about today?  Well, the space shuttle Endeavor has to come down eventually. 
[01:11:30]  The what?  The, uh-huh.  Space shuttle Endeavor.  It has to come down eventually, and they got some nice, nice graphics on TV of this gouge.  A few chunks taken out of the bottom.  It's pretty deep.  Yeah.  When do we get to make our popcorn and watch this thing come back to earth?  Oh.  It's going to be a dosage.  Godspeed.  Yeah, no kidding.  Get them home safe.  Also, it's official Michael Vick is not playing this year.  The whole year they spent this year, man. 
[01:12:00]  Yep.  He's a dog killer.  Bonds is announcing that he's, uh, next year it's going to be his last year in the majors.  What?  Uh, Pat Riley, whatever.  He's going to coach it three more years.  Who cares about that?  And, uh, we got Van Halen reuniting here.  We got some audio.  Yeah.  This is, this is, this is a disaster waiting to happen.  Now, wait.  It's, it's, it's, it's David Lee Roth.  It's Eddie Van Halen.  It's, um.  Alex Van Halen.  Alex Van Halen.  And Wolfgang.  And Wolfgang.  Oh.  Wolf. 
[01:12:30]  Wolf.  Wolf.  Which pretty much is the, the three family members against one retard.  Yeah.  Uh, David Lee Roth.  So, that whole dynamic isn't going to work very well if there's ever, if there's ever  some kind of problem between David Lee Roth and Eddie.  Yeah.  The other guys, who are they going to back?  Yeah.  The, the, they're going to back the Van Halen name.  You know, I'm reading a book, uh, and, and they mentioned, uh, Led Zeppelin and Robert  Plant and they asked Robert Plant, why, why didn't you ever like, you know, reunite using 
[01:13:00]  like, uh, John Bottoms, uh, son, Jason Bottoms.  Yeah.  And Robert Plant just goes, because Jason Bottoms isn't as good of a drummer as his father  was.  Yeah.  I'm like, ooh, ooh, that's, that's a little nasty to say.  But, uh, you want to hear some, some audio from the.  Wait, now, what is, what is Wolfgang playing the drums or the bass?  No, he's playing the bass.  He's doing Michael Anthony's part.  Michael Anthony's, uh, part.  Michael Anthony was also the one that threw all the high vocals in on top of, uh, Sammy 
[01:13:30]  Hagar's vocals and, uh, David Lee Roth's vocals.  Very high.  He could sing very high.  Yeah.  And that's kind of the trademark Van Halen sound, that real high harmony over the vocals.  So who's, who's going to do that?  Maybe Wolf.  I don't think Wolf.  Wolfie can do that.  My mother's Valerie Bertinelli and she's losing weight.  I see her in the fatty girl commercials.  She's losing weight with Kirstie Alley.  They eat salads together. 
[01:14:00]  She'll be backstage with Mackenzie Phillips.  They get the green apple splatters together every afternoon from the food they're eating.  But they're losing weight.  I realize this is sacrilege.  I just never dug Van Halen.  No.  They don't suck, obviously, but I just never...  For the time when they first came out, especially, they were huge.  Growing up, I loved Van Halen.  Yeah.  You can't deny it.  And everyone knew how to make the little logo on their freaking notebooks and stuff.  Then they alienated some of the listeners, but got some new ones when they brought in Sammy.  Yeah.  And then, you know, that era, that whole thing was over. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Done with Goodbye.  What'd they do that was good, though?  Like, the couple...  My favorite Van Halen...  And the cradle will rock!  I like Panama's my favorite.  Running with the devil!  They did a bunch of...  They had a bunch of hits, man.  That's okay.  Jamie's Crying I Never Liked.  Jamie's Crying.  I just never liked...  A bunch of cool riffs.  Hot for teacher, are ya? 
[01:15:00]  Well, I got a little...  Yeah, okay.  That was good.  That was toward the end.  Yeah, Jimmy, that was toward the end.  That was toward the end.  We're talking about the first few were undeniably great albums.  Yeah.  I don't...  Ain't talking about love.  How'd that go?  Oh, my God.  Crank up ain't talking about love.  Come on.  Can you do it?  Oh, we rock.  Is it on?  Am I not the only one realizing that he's a...  Yeah, what about eruption, man?  I love how he looks...  Come on.  I love how he looks over here.  Is it on?  Because he needed time to kill.  It's on here. 
[01:15:30]  Ooh.  Sass and Ope.  Yeah, he is.  It's on over here.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, you're playing other clips from there, so, you know, what happened?  Which one did you say?  Eruption.  I mean, some of Eddie's great guitar work in that.  Yeah.  All right.  You rock, you know.  Timing's everything.  Hold on, E-Rock, what's going on?  Don't worry about it.  Are you pushing the button?  It's not working?  Talk.  It's playing right here.  I see it.  The board's on, and nothing's coming out.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  So Eric's saying that he is doing his job, but something is getting fritzed. 
[01:16:00]  But he's not doing his job, because he already played stuff from over there, and it came  out perfectly.  What happened?  So he fiddled with...  Did you get mayo on the board?  Fiddling.  All right, screw it.  Here's Van Halen.  Roth says, this is the press conference we all thought we'd never see.  I love Van Halen.  And now we don't care.  But this is a complete disaster.  Disaster in the making.  Waiting to happen.  And no one really...  The press conference that you probably never thought that you would see happen...  After an on-and-off, often tumultuous 30 years, a new version of the band Van Halen 
[01:16:30]  has emerged from the rock and roll ashes.  What?  At a news conference today...  Why is this idiot talking?  ...original frontman David Lee Roth for the first time since the flamboyant singer quit  more than 10 years ago.  Self-important douche.  After Roth left in 1985, he was replaced for the next decade by Sammy Hagar for this...  Sammy Hagar.  I kind of did that.  The Southern California rockers say not to think of this as a reunion.  This is a brand new band. 
[01:17:00]  We are a band, and we're going to continue.  Yes.  Is that Eddie?  Yeah.  It's a whole new beginning.  Oh, no.  It's a whole new beginning.  Oh, boy.  It's a whole new...  What was that?  His sinuses.  He's got some big problems.  Oh, he has cancer in the sinuses?  I don't know.  He's got some problems.  He can't breathe.  Oh, boy.  Through his nose.  You know...  He's got half a tongue.  You know what this means to us?  Nothing.  The concert goer.  What? 
[01:17:30]  We're going to have to politely clap for new songs that they're going to attempt to sing  for us, and we're going to be like, oh, we're not here for this crap.  This is off our new upcoming album.  Shut up.  Play the hits.  We're called Rebirth.  Yeah, man.  Here's Rebirth.  Featuring Wolfgang on the bass.  We're calling this one 2007.  Running with the Devil 2007.  Yeah.  We'll update one song, and there'll be one song called, we're back, and strong as ever. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, if they do that.  We're back.  You know what?  And strong as ever.  Oh, God.  Together forever.  We're back.  Oh, God.  Shut up.  You're making me cringe.  We're back.  With David Lee Roth and Eddie back to back, like singing into the same mic.  That's right.  Like they're back.  He tries to do a karate kick, and his prostate falls out.  And then Wolfgang comes over and helps everything.  Wolfgang.  And Eddie goes, I cannot reach the stamp. 
[01:18:30]  And he licks the stamp, Wolfgang, for me.  Why am I talking German as Eddie?  Because if you name your son Wolfgang, you got to throw the accent in there.  Oh, my God.  If you're known for classic rock, do us all a favor.  No one wants to hear your new crap.  Throw it on the internet, and maybe some fans will find it.  Yeah.  Drop something.  Holy Jesus.  What is going on around here today?  What happened?  You knocked over E-Rock's lunchbox. 
[01:19:00]  What the hell, Tim?  Mumps neck.  That was Tim this time.  Exactly.  Yeah.  He sits in that time and just kicked his speaker over.  He goes, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The speaker went flying.  It certainly did.  I love that we have a professional loud.  Very loud.  It's ruined the studio Tuesday.  Yeah.  All right.  See, we told him that rock and roll just gets nutty in here.  Yeah, you got to kick over a speaker.  Yeah, that's what it was.  He was just, like, being cool. 
[01:19:30]  Watch how crazy I'm going to get.  Oh.  Whoa, you spent some water on the floor.  A little water on the carpet.  Look at that thing.  That's never going to be the same there.  No, it worked out.  Let's see if we can get some real, like, Van Halen clips here.  Usually when a band comes back like us, it's Rockers with Walkers.  And this is everything but.  Meet us in the future.  He's killing.  All right.  You know, the whole Rockers with Walkers.  Let's break this down a little bit.  Yeah, please.  Name one band that came back as Rockers with Walkers.  Literally?  That old gag.  Yes.  Let me think. 
[01:20:00]  The Moody Blues?  Even the Rolling Stones, man.  Yeah.  Freaking, supposedly Mick Jagger still, like, is on a treadmill 10 miles a day.  Yeah, he runs around the stage like a nut.  We saw him at Giant Stadium about a year, year and a half.  Yeah.  Well, now it's probably close to two years.  That guy was running all over the stage.  And he's pushing, what, 70 at this point?  The Who, right?  He's an amazing shit.  The Who.  Roger Daltrey's still singing and running around the stage.  Name one band that came back as Rockers with Walkers.  Hmm.  Actually, Rackers with Whackers. 
[01:20:30]  Usually you see, like, your favorite band from back in the day and you go, Dan, the  lead guitarist is younger than me.  What happened?  They sneak a young guitarist in there and no one's looking.  That's what they did with Wolfgang.  Wolfgang.  Is Wolfgang fat, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, Wolfie's a little fat.  Fat too.  I think he got some of his mother's genes.  With the pudgy, pudgy Valerie Bertinelli Lifetime Network genes.  But meet us in the future, not the past year.  Van Halen hadn't finished the future, not the past year. 
[01:21:00]  But guitarist Eddie Van Halen entered rehab.  The band didn't want a tour until everyone could give 100%.  Of the money to what?  The immediate future.  None of us want to give you less than our best.  And we are at our best.  Why not?  Oh my God.  Don't even say you're at your best.  How could you say you're at your best?  You're not at your best.  I would guess 19...  What year do you want to say?  79?  81, maybe. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Yeah, 79.  I would go with 1979.  They were at their best.  You're at your best.  This is nowhere near their best.  At your best?  You're not at your best.  David Lee Roth dresses like your father.  That's not what you want to see when you're thinking Van Halen at their best.  Hot for teacher in a sweater vest.  Right.  We're not.  I want to give you our best.  I want to give you the best.  Look at Wolfgang.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Who's that fat kid?  Oh, he's the fat kid. 
[01:22:00]  There's the...  We've got Valerie's shape, man.  That is Valerie Bertinelli.  There's a kid that was never denied dessert, huh?  He looks like a young Ron Bennington.  Wow.  It's Wolfgang and Fez.  Yeah, Fez.  He looks like a young Ron with a guitar.  You're at our best.  A band like this, particularly coming after an absence of this amount of time, can get  away with a lot if only you do one tour.  That's not our ambition here. 
[01:22:30]  This is not like the police.  The idea is that this will continue on and on.  All right, now...  Oh, boy.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, boy.  The police pretty much got back together for money.  We all know that.  Yeah.  But the police tour will kick this tour's ass.  It has been.  My brother went and saw the police and said it was amazing.  Oh, really?  Because Sting hasn't lost a goddamn thing as far as his singing goes.  The band sounds great.  He goes, it was like you were seeing the police from years ago.  You know?  They don't look like they're falling apart.  And the ticket was a lot of money. 
[01:23:00]  So they're making a fortune.  Now this, he's talking about this being one tour and then going on and on and on, huh?  Well, because then they'll probably play, you know, they'll come up with some new songs.  Well, Future Not the Past.  Which one?  Which song will they come up with?  Well, there was a...  I wish I could remember your new song.  I got the song I just sang there.  We're back.  We're back.  And we're as good as ever.  We're back. 
[01:23:30]  Together forever.  We're back.  Little guitar thing.  And Fat Boy will come in.  Fat Boy.  Fat Boy.  It's Fatty.  Valerie Bertinelli is on TV.  Look.  Oh, it's Jenny Craig.  Maybe we could come up with a potential Van Halen song for these guys.  Future Not the Past year, like he just said, that might be the title of the album.  Future Not the Past year.  How about, like, emissions? 
[01:24:00]  Are they Journey?  Should be Futurality Pasture, and they're in a cow pasture,  and Eddie is cutting off a cow's tongue trying to use it.  All right, we get to...  We learn about Wolfgang here.  Helping the band continue its latest edition,  Eddie's 16-year-old son, Wolfgang.  It's a great gig.  I just, like, started playing one summer,  and I just sort of slipped in.  As for the thought of a 16-year-old hitting the road 
[01:24:30]  for a full-blown rock and roll tour,  Wolfgang defers to his mom, actress Valerie Bertinelli.  Let's just say she's watching me closely.  Oh, boy.  Interesting.  He's going to be all effed up on the road, huh?  Great. Good luck to you.  Couldn't you get a bassist?  Like, why would you use your 16-year-old kid?  To keep the money in the family.  Right, right.  It sounds like this has a lot to do with money.  Why pay a bass player when you can keep the money in the family? 
[01:25:00]  And he's got the Van Halen name.  I think they're just going to pay David Lee Roth like a per diem.  And the family keeps all the money because it's their name.  And the kid's going to be a hit every time he hits the stage with his father.  Oh, they're going to have to do, like, a solo off.  You think, like, Eddie will do something,  and then Wolfie will have to do something,  and then Alex will do something on the drums.  It'll be a big family thing, like, friggin', like, old age Hanson.  I say there's some kind of handing over of the guitar. 
[01:25:30]  Dramatically, Eddie takes his guitar off and gives it to Wolf.  And Mike, with a lot of pride, hands over the guitar.  And then Wolfgang does his version of Eruption.  They'll be back-to-back looking at each other as only a dad and son can do  when one is fat and one is tongueless.  I'm fat, and I'm tongueless, and we're back!  Better than ever, we're back!  Can we use your machine yet there, E-Rock? 
[01:26:00]  I love your song.  Well, Roth promises you will know all the songs.  Well, thank God.  Oh, really?  Let's see what this is all about.  You know, there is a catalog that is as familiar as...  People to this day stop in crosswalks and act out the guitar solos in front of me  in 23 different cities here.  So there's sort of a provided thing.  You know, when the three tenors get together, 
[01:26:30]  you only wait for O Solo Mio,  and the rest of it you can barely pronounce.  With this, you know every single song.  You know every guitar lick, every kick, every jump, every drum lick,  and we can't afford to shirk that D.  He couldn't have picked, like, Kaja Gugu.  Like, when Kaja Gugu plays,  You're just waiting for too shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy.  He picks the three tenors?  I know.  I think the people that go see the three tenors  are sitting on the edge of their seats for the whole freaking...  Yeah, I think if you're going to go to see the three tenors,  you know more than O Solo Mio.  Can I tell you what I hate about David Lee Roth? 
[01:27:00]  He just babbles, and no one, like...  No one challenges him on any of this crap.  You're just babbling.  I'll tell you who called on it, CBS.  And we thank CBS for that.  Hey, that's right.  What are you talking?  No one calls him.  We're sitting here.  It's ironic you mentioned the three tenors.  When his voice is shot, Eddie can't talk,  but there is a fat guy, like a Pavarotti,  and that's the kid.  The three tenors.  Hey, wait till you hear this next Roth clip.  Listen to this one.  How does it feel to be on stage for the first time together 
[01:27:30]  in, oh, so many years?  It feels completely natural.  Strangely enough, after this many summers,  I myself am certainly more aware of it than ever,  of how valuable this band is to me in my history,  how valuable it is to the neighborhood,  to the communities that this music appeals to.  And it's a lot of communities.  It is totally blowing our own minds, 
[01:28:00]  and I think it will yours, too.  It's better than it's ever been.  I grew up on this stuff.  Better than it's ever been.  I can't walk 20 meters down any sidewalk  near any college campus without somebody stopping me  and going, you're that white guy.  See, no one...  Oh, boy.  No one stops.  Shin says that.  No one says that.  They don't.  He didn't get a laugh.  Of course, as he shouldn't have.  And Eddie is just trying to sell it a little too much. 
[01:28:30]  Look, this is the best that we've ever been.  We're ever the best.  This is the best we've ever been.  Can someone pick up my ear?  Just fell off.  Oh, yeah.  We're back!  And we're better than ever!  We're back!  That'll be one of the songs.  Wink, wink.  Yeah, there's the father-son doing the back-to-back guitar thing,  looking at each other over for the Cream magazine shot.  Oh, look!  The guy from Kerrang!  is snapping away!  Look at me!  Stick your tongue out!  I'll not do that.  Just look at him! 
[01:29:00]  We're back!  Hey, I know the Pests love betting.  Get the itinerary for the Van Halen tour  and try to figure out when the tour melts down.  Okay.  And then all of a sudden they have to cancel the rest of the dates.  I say by Charlotte.  Dude.  We gotta give them...  November 13th, Madison...  That's the first gig.  Hold on, hold on.  Madison Square Garden, November 13th?  No effing way.  We'll never see them at Madison Square Garden.  If you live in Canada and maybe want to see them,  you best get your tickets for Toronto. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, that's the fourth one in.  Because the last gigs in Vancouver, Edmonton, and Calgary.  Good luck to you.  I'm gonna say Meltdown by Cleveland, Ohio.  All right.  I'm gonna say that's...  Wait.  Thursday?  September?  October?  October.  That's five in.  Five in?  Five shows in.  I'm thinking the excitement of the first couple of gigs  might hold them together a little longer.  Yeah.  Maybe through...  They're gonna squeak halfway through October.  I give them to Chicago. 
[01:30:00]  Chicago?  Before the first big problem.  October 18th.  Boston, you don't have a shot of seeing them, man.  October 30th?  No way.  I don't know about that.  I give them...  I think they'll make it through Los Angeles November 20th.  I'll tell you why.  Wow.  Because I think they'll start hating each other around where you guys are saying.  But then there's a whole run of big cities.  You got Chicago for two.  Rosemont is a Chicago for all intents and purposes.  You got Chicago.  You got Boston.  You got East Rutherford.  You got New York and L.A.  All coming together.  Those are major cities. 
[01:30:30]  Probably major money.  So you're thinking logically, though.  You're thinking money.  Let's make sure we make the money.  They're beyond that sometimes.  They can't work with each other.  After Los Angeles is Glendale, Arizona.  And then San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose, Portland.  It dives off.  Yeah, but those are all kind of where they all live and stuff.  They'll be close to home except for Roth, who now lives in New York.  But Philly's really lucky.  Philly has the third date in. 
[01:31:00]  October 1st.  Al Dukes is chiming in saying, I think Cleveland is where the Roth-Hagar tour fell apart.  If that helps.  If that helps.  So they're going to try to get past Cleveland because they don't want it to happen again in Cleveland.  Hey, we got two more quick clips.  We got Roth mentioning his radio career.  Well.  We all know how well that went.  And we thank Christ for it.  We ended up replacing Roth.  So this could be kind of interesting to listen to.  We decided to do everything that you expect but to make it high-speed, low-drag. 
[01:31:30]  Make it modern.  Make it move.  And like everything that got me fired from radio.  Did you know I was in radio?  I heard something along those lines.  Yeah.  Good one.  You're going to get your expectations but it's been upgraded, updated the same way we've gone from cassette to CD, baby.  Oh, look.  I just chilled out.  And why would you say updated by saying cassette to CD?  Because like CD is kind of an old term now. 
[01:32:00]  Don't.  Yeah.  You should have said you should have went right for iPod.  Yeah, CD to iPod.  And Eddie at least had a good improv.  I heard something along those lines.  I heard something along those lines.  Pardon you.  And it's about time he jumps back in there and saying, we've never sounded better.  All right.  With my son, Wolf.  As he creepily just leaves this disgusting impression in his ice cream cone on stage.  Looks like someone put their heel in it.  Go ahead.  Lick it with your stump.  Old heel tongue.  I don't know. 
[01:32:30]  Stupid.  He has corns on his tongue.  He sounds like the Endeavor guy.  Endeavor.  Big show Endeavor.  All right.  One more clip.  Best show ever.  We kind of got to take a break.  So let's get one last clip here.  We're back.  But it's a never.  Let's go to Detroit.  Hey.  Hey.  I was wondering if David Lee Roth is going to sing his famous, running with the comb  over.  Hey, Dave from Detroit gives us a funny line. 
[01:33:00]  And what is Drew and Mike doing?  Probably reading the newspaper for everybody.  All right.  The final clip from the press conference.  Here we go.  The questions are pursuant to Valerie Wolf's mom, Valerie Bertinelli.  Everybody knows who she is and stuff.  And the next obvious question will be, how am I getting along with Valerie?  And I want to say that now we're getting along fine.  The first time we ran into each other up at the studio, she had the kind of look like  she was down at the family gym and the devil showed up looking to throw the ball around. 
[01:33:30]  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  I wish we were there.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  You, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Boosie, boosie, bat.  I don't know.  What is he saying?  He just babbles.  No one calls him out on any of this crap.  Now, forgive my, was Valerie and David a problem back in the day?  I would gather.  Well, why would he even bring her up?  Because she's like separated from Eddie, I'm hearing. 
[01:34:00]  Unless they got back together.  Yeah.  Who has a family gym?  Going to the family gym.  Can I hear that quote one more time?  Sure.  Because I'm going to try to decipher it.  All right.  Let's go.  The questions are pursuant to Valerie, Wolf's mom, Valerie Bertinelli.  Everybody knows, you know, who she is and stuff.  And the next obvious question will be, how am I getting along with Valerie?  And I want to say that now we're getting along fine.  The first time we ran into each other up at the studio, she had the kind of look like 
[01:34:30]  she was down at the family gym and the devil showed up looking to throw the ball around.  The devil showed up looking to throw the ball around.  Why would the devil do that?  He probably hates sports.  Yeah.  And it's a gym and the devil's pretty buff on his own.  Yeah.  He can't throw a ball with those silly hooves.  Yeah.  He's a lousy, he's a great exterminator of the masses.  He's a terrible free throw shooter.  Can't even run down the court.  He's tripping over his tail the whole time.  Oh, he's got that tail. 
[01:35:00]  He tries to stuff with one of his horns, gets stuck in the net.  Yeah.  He goes to do defense and he slides on his hooves.  Yeah.  His stupid hooves.  He goes down like when you see a horse fall on something slippery, looks all silly and  he's the devil.  So he's mad and he kills eight million people.  What happens with David Lee Roth too?  Like he says his crap and people start laughing because they don't want to be the ones not  laughing.  The ones not laughing at David Lee Roth?  Right.  Because while everyone else is laughing, I better laugh.  He might have gotten away with it when he was babbling to Nina Blackwood on MTV, but now he's 
[01:35:30]  not that guy anymore.  He doesn't have that charisma.  Oh, Valerie is kind of making sure Wolfgang is okay on tour.  So she will be going on tour to watch after her son.  Oh, that's great.  Your divorced wife.  Take your divorced wife and the guy, the singer that you hate and she hates.  Right.  On tour.  Oh, this is rock and roll all the way.  All right.  Look at the list.  If Valerie is coming, I'm going to have to back off from Chicago.  All right.  So David Lee Roth doesn't get along with Valerie.  Valerie doesn't really get along with Eddie anymore. 
[01:36:00]  Hello, Cleveland.  Yeah.  I say Cleveland.  By Cleveland, it's over.  I don't know though.  Philly has a way of really effing things up.  That's October 1st.  Dude, how is that rock and roll?  Can you imagine bringing your divorced wife on our little comedy tour?  On our comedy tour.  Because you so happen to have some kind of son or something that is 16 years old and he's  getting into comedy.  Oh my God.  And she's there just to make sure he's safe on tour.  Holy Jesus. 
[01:36:30]  How is that going to work for these guys?  Well, she better get used to the C word.  That's all I would have said.  How about this?  How about this?  For everybody listening out there, your divorce.  Imagine your divorced wife coming to your job.  And not those couples that get along after the divorce.  Right.  Like in a movie couple.  The guy comes over and still helps out.  You need help with that door hinge?  I'll get it for you.  You know, I remember.  And then they reflect on a nice fun moment they used to have.  Look in each other's eyes.  Realize it still wouldn't work.  And then he goes back off somewhere instead of thrusting that screwdriver into her chest 
[01:37:00]  like he should want to.  And Eddie's currently dating the band's PR woman?  What does her nationality have to do with it?  I know.  This is nothing rock and roll about this for you.  This has all the makings of a bomb.  You need.  An unstable bomb at that.  You need alcohol.  You need who is.  Who is.  No, this is better than ever.  Oh, yeah.  Better than ever.  We're back.  Yes.  All right, we got to do.  Together forever. 
[01:37:30]  Together forever.  We're back.  And he'll do like a little kick and spin in the video.  And his woes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whoa.  You'll think we never left.  We're back.  Ow.  All right, we got a break.  We're really, really late.  Trust me.  But we'll be back.  And we'll be better than ever.  We can do it.  I know, Tom.  See?  See?  Oh.  Because I, you know, people yell at me because I stop things in their tracks.  But look, there. 
[01:38:00]  Who yelled at me?  Now he's coming through the stupid listeners.  Oh, they're on a roll.  And they don't be able to stop everybody.  Go app yourself.  Stupid listeners.  The show doesn't run if we don't play the commercials, you idiots.  Hey, we got a pair of tickets to the Virus Tour at the PNC Bank Art Center on Saturday,  August 25th, courtesy of Blades of Glory on DVD, in stores everywhere, Tuesday, August 28th.  We'll give a pair of tickets to a random caller right now for the big O&A child and virus  comedy show.  It's a funny movie. 
[01:38:30]  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  What's up, everybody?  It's Opie Anthony, Jim Norton.  It's Louis C.K. in studio.  Hey, fellas.  I had to apologize.  He was waiting a long time in the green room, but we went off on a little tear about this  Van Halen reunion.  You know what's going to be awful about the new song, too?  They're going to put lines from the old songs in it, like, we're back, and we're still running  with the devil.  They'll, like, throw a line like...  Oh, don't. 
[01:39:00]  They will.  Like a clip show?  Like a flashback clip show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A musical clip show.  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's embarrassing just to think of that.  Yes.  And he can't jump like he used to, but he's making fun of all the other bands that come  back and are a bit older.  Dude, he can't sing.  He can't sing?  He can't jump?  He talks his way through songs.  He was insane when he was doing his radio show.  We've heard the stories.  Yeah.  Palm trees in the hallways.  He wanted to, like, decorate to get a cool vibe.  It was always about the vibe. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Everything's about the vibe.  No, I'm not feeling the vibe.  The vibe?  Do a radio show.  How about this?  The listeners weren't feeling your show.  Yeah, they weren't feeling the vibe coming out of the speakers.  I don't want to, I don't know if Al's going to dump this, but David Lee Roth was a horse's  patoot.  Wow.  Easy.  No one's going to hear that.  Jeez.  That was vulgar.  World's oldest woman died.  And, you know, this happens.  Yeah, whatever.  It was during a home invasion.  She was struck in the chin with a wrench for making a racial slur. 
[01:40:00]  Does that mean that they were perfectly acceptable when she was a kid?  Absolutely.  It was a term of affection.  When you needed some bread out of the oven.  The world's oldest vagina is in the ground now.  Wow.  Basically.  I didn't even think of that.  Yeah, Louie.  New angle on this world's oldest thing.  Oh, wow.  The very oldest, most disgusting, depressing.  Oh, man.  I would love to know what that looks like.  Oh, man.  It's been years.  No, you don't. 
[01:40:30]  It should have been her last act to just show everybody.  Here's what the ravages of time does to the most beautiful thing on earth.  Yeah.  She opens her left.  Looks like an old Mexican cave.  An old Mexican.  I'll say what it looks like.  It looks like Barbara Bush frowning.  Now we can start the looks like bit.  Now we just started it looks like.  Like a dried Turkish apricot. 
[01:41:00]  But maybe.  I don't think we can start the looks like bit.  No, I know.  Now that we've said what it was.  I know.  Here we go.  I know the rules.  She died at 114 years old.  She's from.  Oh, boy.  Who wants to attempt the town?  Chicago?  It's over there in Japan.  Oh, she's in Japan.  You know, over there, the hand can be used like a knife.  I saw that on TV once.  That's right.  All right.  A knife that's really dull and has a fleshy edge to it. 
[01:41:30]  How about we do this?  We spell out the town and then the other people can play along at home.  Okay.  Okay.  The town is this.  F-U-K.  Right.  Geez.  They love having fun with that noise.  Is that the only name?  That's the name of the town?  F-U-K-U-O-K-A.  Fuck you, okay?  Is that what it is?  Uh, who thinks that's it?  I think I just said what you spelled.  Boy, I don't think that's it.  Let's just go with Fukuka. 
[01:42:00]  Fukuka.  F-U-K-U-K-U-K-U-K-U-K-A.  Yonminagawa, who had been certified by Britain's Guinness World Records as the world's oldest  person at age 114 earlier  this year died of old age Monday  evening.  114. Hope she died of old age.  How funny would that be if her grandson got crazy  and drop kicked her down the stairs  practicing his kung fu.  Like she was healthy as a mule. She was carrying  churned butter in a bucket  up steps and her grandson 
[01:42:30]  got randy and just drop kicked her.  She had another 30 years in her.  She was doing awesome.  She was still active sexually.  She was making her yogurt meal.  Yogurt meal.  Whenever they have old people  always say like those  hundreds of years old people like oh she actually  met Napoleon. There's always something like that.  Yeah. Like weren't there any old people  that didn't meet any Napoleon or  anybody? No just kind of lived their life  and that was it. But here's the deal.  114 years old. Yeah whatever. 
[01:43:00]  But then you have to go back to the year she was born.  1893.  1893.  So what was she  what was around in 1893?  That's a lot of stuff.  Not much.  Grover Cleveland was president.  Oh Grover.  And then after him was McKinley  and McKinley got shot in his stupid  fat face.  And then  and then Roosevelt  then Teddy Roosevelt.  So she was  how about  she was born three presidents before  two presidents before  Teddy Roosevelt.  How about this?  Thomas Edison finishes 
[01:43:30]  construction of the first  first motion picture studio.  I'm trying to look at some  receives two U.S. patents.  The first one for  a cut out of  for incandescent  electric lamps.  Oh by the way  she was born  when the president was  Benjamin Harrison.  Oh really?  It was the end of his  his reign.  Wow.  And then he was succeeded  obviously by  Grover Cleveland.  I think it's funny that you  said you succeeded  obviously  like we all do.  Oh yes  logically that would be nice.  Obviously.  You could have said he was  succeeded by Lyndon Johnson 
[01:44:00]  and I would have said  oh okay.  Sure.  It's just an opportunity  to look smart.  Okay.  Like wow they know a lot  about their presidents.  It's amazing anybody  lived to be old in 18  because back then  they knew nothing  about health.  No.  Everybody smoked.  They thought cancer  was a delicacy.  Idiots.  No the guy who  delivered her  the doctor was wearing  a tie and a belt  and you know.  Dude.  Are you ready for this?  Back in 1893  this is how old  this broad was.  The United States  legally declares  the tomato 
[01:44:30]  to be a vegetable.  Yes.  I legally declare  What was it before that?  That it was a human being.  Well it's a dispute  because it could be  considered a fruit  because it has seeds.  Yeah.  So they had to argue  that for a while.  Still debated to this day.  That's right.  Yes.  Thank God they were  worrying about that.  How about the first  car number plates?  Oh yeah.  The first license plates.  The first license plates  you used to just be  able to drive around.  And a very happy birthday 
[01:45:00]  on that day.  What?  To Herman Goering.  Oh Goering was  Goering was born  on that year.  In that year.  Of course he perished  in 1946.  Along with  Alfred Rosenberg  also a Nazi official  who also  somehow died  in 1946.  Oh Jimmy Durante  was born the same year  as of this old broad  and he ended up  dying in 1980.  It was great.  It was awful.  We have anything else 
[01:45:30]  to add?  By the way the tomato  only had  what is that  seven fifths  or three fifths?  Three fifths  of the vote  before that.  Who's against it?  Is that it?  Cheasing of course.  That's all the stuff  we got on 1893?  Who's the dissenting?  Oh what are you kidding?  She freaking  was born in a dull year.  A dull year.  Wasn't much going on.  I'm just looking at  who else was born.  What about deaths?  Who died then?  Like when the hell  were they born? 
[01:46:00]  Anyone from 1700?  Wait who died  in 1893 on that?  A British entomologist  by the name of  John Westwood  Yeah.  was born in 1805  Yeah.  and he died  in 18  whatever the hell  that was.  Yeah the 88  they lived to be old  back then.  What was going on?  Well the average  She's in Japan  in a small town  of Japan.  How much even  changes there?  True.  It's just been  the same  stupid street.  She's walked around  in the wooden shoes  and done the same thing.  Little  ding ding ding ding ding 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Those block shoes  those things  with the little wooden  strip molding  on the bottom.  It's not like  she has a skyscraper  in a Walmart  in her town.  Yeah.  Let's say hi  to John of Rochester.  John what's up?  Hey guys.  Hey.  What's up buddy?  Fukuoka  is the name  of that city  in Japan.  Fukuoka?  Yeah.  Fukuoka.  Cool.  What happens  in that town?  Nothing.  Nothing?  I was working.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Also dying  in that year 
[01:47:00]  was PGT  Beauregard.  He was an  American  Confederate  General.  Wow.  So she was born  the year  a Confederate  General died.  All right.  Let's go to  Paul on Long Island.  Paul.  Hey.  What's up guys?  Hey.  I think you kind of  missed the point.  She also survived  two nuclear bombs  being dropped  around that tiny village.  All right.  Yeah.  Well.  There's something to be said.  Well so then  we didn't hurt  him that bad.  Yeah.  That radiation  might have  helped her out.  Why? 
[01:47:30]  How close is  her place  to Nagasaki  or Hiroshima?  I don't know.  I think it's far  but she would  vacation there  every year  after it happened.  She had cousins  in Nagasaki.  Her and her one  wispy hair  all of a sudden  got healthy.  She had one tooth  and one hair  but she was always  smiling and laughing.  So that lady's  been okay.  14 years ago  was I'm bad at math.  That was what year?  97?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or 93.  That's 10 years ago.  93 was 10 years ago.  No.  14 years ago  I was 93. 
[01:48:00]  93.  I'm like beyond  bad at math.  I know.  I know.  I guess what I'm  trying to get at  is that she has  been really old  since like the 60s.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  She's been like  a really old  lady.  That's something.  Before there were  the Beatles  she was an old  Japanese lady.  She was already  really old.  A smelly old woman.  With a completely  worthless vagina.  She was muggable.  That's how long  it's been. 
[01:48:30]  She was muggable  before black people  could vote in this country.  Wow.  That's how long  she's been attackable.  Damn.  It's nowhere near  any of the  big cities right?  I just want to go  on record.  I don't know who  this lady was  or what her name  was but I'm glad  she's dead.  I don't know her.  I don't know what  she is.  I hope that she  comes back to life  and dies again.  Wouldn't it be funny  if she was a hooker  until three years ago?  She was quicker  she got bored.  She was for some 
[01:49:00]  reason the most  popular hooker  in that town.  Guys would go  to her in the  bachelor parties  as a goof.  What does she do  for her life?  Everyone she knows  has to be dead.  There can't be  one person  that she was  friends with  or family  or anything.  Unless there's  a bunch of  teenagers she  hangs out with  the old guy  in the beach  movies.  Creepy old guy  in the movies.  This creepy  ancient woman  trying to be  young and hip. 
[01:49:30]  Hey what are you  guys doing here?  And they all go  hey grandma  play a song.  Her son could be  90.  That's right.  She could tell  her son to shut  up and watch  your language.  And he's 90.  90 years old.  Her son could be  100 years old.  They're dead.  They're dead.  They're all dead.  Let's move on.  That's enough of  this old lady.  Yeah she stinks  and she's dead.  Goodbye.  Maury Phobias.  We gotta get back  to this.  We started this  last week.  Maury's coming  in tomorrow so we  really should play  this today. 
[01:50:00]  Get everyone all  riled up for  tomorrow's visit.  Who's Maury?  Maury does these  phobia shows there  Louie.  Maury Povich?  Maury Povich.  And it's hilarious  because he gets  really really  deranged and  into it and he  thinks he could  cure like someone's  phobia in a 10  minute segment.  By completely  scaring the crap  out of them with  what they're afraid  of.  Right.  There's no  therapist's way of  slowly getting you  into something and  baby steps or  nothing.  He will immerse 
[01:50:30]  you in what you  are afraid of and  just scare the  crap out of people  and then laugh as  they're going look  at it.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Now why is she  doing that?  How about we  love Maury.  He's an animal.  So he's coming  here tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  Here.  Like this one we  played last week  just to bring up  the speed though.  So there was this  lady Andrea.  She was afraid of  birds.  Told this story  while she was  convinced the birds  were following her  and pooping on her  all the time.  They were after her  funnel cake.  Blah blah blah.  Tells the whole story.  And now it's time  for Maury to attempt  to cure her. 
[01:51:00]  And she's crying as  she's telling these  stories.  She's like and I  went to the mall  and the birds came  out.  Like just talking  about it had her  in a tizzy.  So Maury decides  he knows how to  cure her.  And the cure is to  bring out lots of  birds.  Birds.  Have her face her  fear.  You have to face  your fears.  You have to have  you face your fears  Andrea.  Let's bring out  the birds.  Oh unless I have  dramatic music  here that'll help  her.  Let's have  dramatic music here.  That'll help her. 
[01:51:30]  Whoa whoa whoa.  Wait a second I'm  Pam wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  Don't do what I  knew you would do.  Come here.  Andrea.  Andrea.  Andrea.  One bird.  It's one little bird.  She's afraid of birds. 
[01:52:00]  Doesn't matter if  there's one or a  thousand.  But also his  it makes no sense.  He's not like going  yes face it.  This is a bird.  He's going what's the  matter?  What's the problem?  Are you crazy?  You just told me  through your tears  what your problem was  and now I bring one  out and you're crying.  I thought you'd like  the bird.  And there's no help  whatsoever going on  here.  I don't understand.  I thought you liked  birds was the point  of the story.  Let's not stand here.  Look we're going to  I want you to be  prepared for this.  We're going to bring  a bird out on the 
[01:52:30]  other end of the  stage.  No no no no.  Calm down.  Yeah.  He's not going to  he's going to be in a  cage way over there.  I just want you to  look at him.  Yeah.  We're here with you.  Everyone's supporting  you.  We know you're afraid.  We understand that.  It's normal to feel  afraid.  No.  He's like where is  he?  Bring out a bird!  Bring out the bird!  What's the matter of  you?  It's just a bird!  Why are you crying  you dummy it's a bird?  He's this close to tying  her head.  He's this close to  tying her to a chair.  Face your fear!  Face it!  Face it!  You think she's 
[01:53:00]  getting out?  You think she's  acting out?  I don't think so.  He's chastising  the audience.  Andrea, Andrea,  stand up.  Stand up.  It's going to be  all right.  I'm going to take  him away.  I'm going to take  him away.  Stand up.  That's not going  to happen.  You don't even  want to look at  him.  He's hyperventilating.  We're going to  take him away.  They're gone.  They're gone.  Stand up here.  Oh, God.  Oh, awesome. 
[01:53:30]  Bob Kelly?  We'll be back  right after this.  He sounds so happy.  Let's pay some bills.  We'll be back  right after this.  Job accomplished.  Job accomplished.  You can hear  the grin in his voice.  He loves it.  We'll be back  right after this.  Here go my ratings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We accomplished  what we wanted.  Oh, God.  Now it's time  to pay some bills.  Look at the bird.  Go on.  Look at it.  Do we have time  to play Cotton Man 
[01:54:00]  before we go to break?  Oh, please, Cotton Man.  And then after the break,  we got April,  who's afraid of frogs,  and then we got  Victoria, who's afraid  of lizards.  Give a little  of the Cotton Man.  Yeah, so there's  another lady  scared of cotton balls.  She hates the sound  of it.  And I kind of  understand that.  You ever pull  cotton apart,  and it goes like,  Yeah.  Makes a slight,  weird, textured sound  to it.  But this woman  says she hates that  and hates cotton.  She's scared  crapless of it.  And it goes back  to her being a kid  where she had  nightmares of a  cotton ball man  who tried to kill her 
[01:54:30]  by shoving cotton balls  in her mouth.  Cotton balls in her mouth.  There's something else  going on there,  obviously.  Of course there is.  So fat, pale uncle.  Yeah, exactly.  So it was time to  Cottony soft.  We're boxer briefs.  It was time to cure  her phobia.  So what does Maury do?  He brings out a guy  completely covered  in cotton balls.  In cotton balls.  It's like a Letterman  bit or something.  Right, right, right.  And then the cotton ball man,  here's a picture.  It's up on YouTube.  It looks like a porno movie.  Yeah.  He starts chasing  her around the stage. 
[01:55:00]  Look at this guy.  He chases her around the stage.  That's scary enough  if you're not afraid of cotton.  That would be a great  creature for a movie.  It looks like the mummy.  The cotton man.  The cotton man.  And look at her.  It didn't scare you  away from eating.  They light her dramatically  so she'll...  Yeah, from underneath.  A lot of bright light.  That'd be a great horror movie.  Cotton ball man.  He's defeated by a dryer.  The lint filter got him.  You upset at those?  Yeah.  I hear it.  Tell me about this.  They're making that noise.  What noise?  They're just making a noise. 
[01:55:30]  Cotton doesn't make a noise.  It does.  See again.  He's like pretending to...  Are you nuts?  Wait, wait.  Carolyn, don't go back there.  You're going to see more cotton  than you want to see.  Don't go back there.  There's a lot of cotton back there.  Carolyn, come here.  He's laughing at her.  This is one...  Help me!  Oh, God. 
[01:56:00]  I love Maury.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  There's somebody who works for the show.  I can't.  He's laughing.  He's laughing at her.  He's laughing at her.  He's laughing at her back.  Move back, guys.  Move back.  Move back.  Okay.  We got it.  We got it.  All right.  We got it, he says.  Yeah, we got it.  We got it. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  One for safety.  Chase her again.  We got it.  We got the shot we needed.  We got it, he said.  We got the fat, scared lady crying.  A fat pig running from a man with cotton balls on his head.  Oh, my God.  How do you not love Maury?  We got it.  We got the money shot.  Goddamn Maury.  Oh, he's the Hitler of whatever he does.  You know something, though?  He never fails to come up with stuff to keep his show rolling.  Well, after the break, we got a lady that's afraid of frogs and lizards.  I think you're right.  Two more ladies to go. 
[01:57:00]  He was probably about to get canceled.  They brought him in and said, look, this show is just no good.  And he went, wait, look what I got coming.  I got ideas.  I showed him the cotton man, and they went, all right.  All right, another week.  Give me another week.  Break out the real life.  I got ideas.  All right.  Hey, and for Al down the hall, when he does his show, run down, 923krock.com.  Go to the Opie and Anthony section.  Make sure you include these videos for everybody, because it's hilarious.  The cotton ball man chasing her is a great video.  Yeah, and they taped it like a horror movie, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Louie, anything we're promoting?  I'm all over the road.  I got a tour called Shoot Up, and it's on MySpace. 
[01:57:30]  Louie C.K. on MySpace?  Yeah.  For all the tour dates?  All the tour dates.  I'm all over the country.  That makes it very easy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Car Crash Comedy is coming back to the Opie and Anthony show, Friday, August 17th in Washington,  D.C.  I'm more nervous than Governor McGreevy at a rest stop.  Oh, no.  If you think you're funny, you're invited to put your comedy stylings on display for an  esteemed panel of judges and a live studio audience.  All right, and remember the rules of the game are you get two minutes, and if you get car 
[01:58:00]  crashed three times, you have to stop because you stink.  Or, uh...  Email sam at foundrymusic.com because Sam thinks he's funny.  And who better to judge an unfunny person like yourself than someone who thinks he's funny?  Just hit the street to the hall, please.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Louie C.K. in studio today.  I am.  We're in the middle of talking about Maury and one of his phobia shows. 
[01:58:30]  Maury.  The videos are just great.  Make sure you check them out.  Why are you running?  Come here.  I know.  I can't wait to talk to him tomorrow about this whole thing.  How he just scares the bejesus out of people and laughs at them.  And who does he think he is that he could, like, you know, cure someone's phobia in 10  minutes before a commercial break?  I don't think he thinks he's curing anybody.  That's true.  But we got to call him.  I'm not on a limb here, but...  We got to call him out on it tomorrow.  Definitely.  But every time we call out Maury, he loves our show, by the way, we try to call him out 
[01:59:00]  and he's like, yeah, I'd do that for Ray.  Oh, yeah.  He's not trying to fake anything.  The thing is that nobody's going to care because, well, who is he hurting?  Some fat lady who's afraid of cotton.  Nobody cares.  You think people care about that fat lady that's afraid of cotton that they're going  to write in and be like, it's despicable.  I have a fear of cotton.  No, Al Sharpton would be like, well, you know, what's her problem?  Yeah.  Maury is safe until they get a special interest group. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  But he picks things that are like frogs.  Frogs.  G. Gordon Liddy did that, you know, when he was a kid.  I read his autobiography years ago.  Yeah.  When he was a kid, he was afraid of thunderstorms and rats.  So he caught a rat and he ate it and he lashed himself to a tree during a thunderstorm when  he was like eight, ten years old.  That sounds like a Liddy thing.  When he was a child.  Did it work?  Yeah.  He said he wasn't afraid of either anymore.  Psychopath is what it did.  Yeah, I turned him into a nation-ruining psychopath. 
[02:00:00]  I turned him into a lunatic he needed to be.  I turned him into a professional assassin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He sees lots of rats now.  He'll never mess up to it, though.  No.  There's no statute of limitations on murder, he says.  Was he an assassin?  He'll never say.  Oh, he won't tell you.  He won't tell if he's killed anybody.  We had him on the show that day.  We asked him, but he says, he goes, there's no statute of limitations on murder, so I will  never answer that question.  And he brought in his son.  Which is pretty much a yes.  He brought in his son, and his son looked like he's done some things in his young life. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  In the military.  Passing the old family torch.  Creeps.  All right.  Yeah, here's April.  She's afraid of frogs.  I cannot stand frogs.  Frogs make my skin crawl.  I cannot stand a frog's skin.  They're slimy.  Slimy.  They're ugly.  Eyes bulge out.  Their tongues are broke. 
[02:01:00]  When I was little, my brother used to put frogs down my pants.  Okay, here you go.  I hate them.  This is one frog.  At my house, looking at me, it's jumping at me, it's going to kill me.  It's going to kill you.  No more, it's good.  I don't want to talk about them no more.  No!  No!  No! 
[02:01:30]  Why does that bother you?  Why does that bother you?  Why does that bother you?  Why?  It's such a weird approach.  They're going to get me.  What?  They're going to get me.  They're this big.  They don't care.  There's like millions of them coming at me and eating me.  Just chasing me.  Wow.  She's on acid.  Yeah.  That's...  Millions of them.  She didn't sound real either.  Yeah, she didn't sound too real.  She came up with like wacky ideas.  You know, the producers are all in the back.  She's like, come up with like things that you think the frogs will do to you. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Like, they must have asked her first, like, what do you think they'll do to you?  I don't know.  I just don't like them.  I'm just not crazy about frogs.  I'm not crazy about...  They kind of look funny.  Yeah, that's...  That's not going to make it.  We need a little more.  So, let's...  Are you afraid that they're going to bite you?  And then they nod, please.  Yeah, yeah.  They're going to bite me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What if a whole bunch came at you?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm afraid a lot are going to attack me.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  And she didn't sell it at all.  No.  She sounded fake.  We should find out more is phobia.  Obviously low ratings.  Because he'll do anything to keep from getting those.  Maury, you're canceled.  What's the matter?  You're canceled.  There's nothing.  Come on.  Just chase him around.  The memo.  You got a face.  His phobia...  Grab this memo.  No.  His phobia is natural graying of hair.  Yes.  The natural graying of hair.  He's still dying his hair.  We'll have to look tomorrow and see if he's dying. 
[02:03:00]  Non-homogenee in his hair.  So Maury has to bring out lots of frogs because that's how you cure this type of thing.  Yes.  Dr. Maury.  But he...  We have to confront your fear.  You know that.  Yes.  So I'm going to bring some frogs out here.  All right.  Now I want you to see these frogs.  Now I want you to see these pirates.  Come on.  Wait a second, April.  Wait.  Wait a second, April.  Wait.  Wait a second.  Just stay right here. 
[02:03:30]  Okay.  All right.  I think I got this.  I got the picture.  I got the picture.  Yeah.  Totally.  I'm not laughing at you.  I'm laughing with you.  Boy, that scared me.  Take the frog away.  Please take the frog.  Get away.  She'll go over the banister.  She'll go right over the banister.  Dave, you better be back there.  She jumped up.  Okay.  Stop it.  All right.  Take it back.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you, ladies and gents.  Okay.  He's trying to get her to...  She'll go over the banister. 
[02:04:00]  Go over the banister.  Yeah.  Please fall over the banister.  Would you go over the banister?  We went over this.  Can you improv with me here?  I'm saying don't do it, but I want you to fly over that banister and crash to the ground.  How crazy.  He gets paralyzed over a frog.  God.  We don't want her to fall over the banister.  We couldn't have that.  And show her underwear.  Pull the trap door.  He's doing exactly what you'd want to do.  Like, when you hear about a lady who's afraid of frogs, all you think of is, I'd love to  throw frogs on that bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  These people are not sympathetic people.  No.  You don't look at them and go, oh, the poor woman.  You're laughing at them.  And he's not faking it, really, because he's laughing a long thing.  This is right.  Come on.  Look at this guy.  This can't be real.  That's a war.  We have time to meet Victoria before we leave this side of the show?  Yeah, what do we got?  Lizards.  Listen to how lizards are affecting Victoria's life.  Every single night, I wake up in a cold sweat because I know that this is what coming from  me and crawling up in my bed. 
[02:05:00]  And they're going to crawl up in my ears and over my body.  And it just terrifies me.  Oh, lizards pick on me.  It's just like they just come after me.  When I see a lizard, I run and I hide.  One day, I was about to bring my daughter.  It's a bad script.  She runs and hides.  When I see a lizard, I run and I hide.  Now, we're back in.  The last one, April was, eh.  Yeah, I don't like her.  I'm believing Victoria.  I like when they're really. 
[02:05:30]  Because they also find dummies out there.  Pick on me.  Pick on me.  I run and I hide.  I like this because she's freaking out before even seeing anything.  Just thinking about it has got her like crying.  So she'll put on a good show.  I don't care if she's fake.  Yeah, I don't care.  She's still entertaining.  Yeah.  Mario would be great if someone was afraid of being sexually assaulted.  He had three guys with ski masks chasing her.  What's the matter?  Just rape.  Come on.  Yeah.  Rape-a-phobe.  One day, I was about to bathe my daughter. 
[02:06:00]  And Alyssa came out of the drain.  And I took off running.  I had to call the police.  I took off taking the lizard and kill a lizard.  I've had to move three times.  Because I know the lizards are coming to get me.  I know they won't leave me alone.  She had to move three times.  Why don't you move to New York?  I was going to say, start moving north.  I've never seen a lizard in New York.  Maybe a pet store.  Hmm?  She's not a diamond bag.  Up on the pet store.  Yeah.  She's just moving from one town in Florida. 
[02:06:30]  In Opie's neighborhood, walking a poodle.  The old women.  Imagine if you were afraid of turtles.  They look like lizards.  Oh, oh, oh.  Geez.  Turtles.  If you're afraid of turtles and you saw Voss' hands coming at you.  I said I bumped.  No, that's.  Any Voss turtle hand reference is good.  Facial endeavor.  Yeah.  She feels the lizards just will leave her alone.  You have added to your own problems.  What state do you live in? 
[02:07:00]  This is Louisiana.  Louisiana.  She's just moving all over Louisiana.  She's moving all over the south.  She's going to be away from the lizards?  Go to Alaska.  Yeah, no lizards there.  If one lizard there, it dies.  It's not the right state for lizards.  But you've got to cure this phobia of lizards.  Oh.  Yeah.  I need to.  I'm tired of living like this.  We're not talking about big.  We're talking about little things.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  They're harmless little things.  No, they're not harmless.  Really?  What do they do?  They pick with me.  What do you mean pick with you? 
[02:07:30]  They just pop up and keep picking with me.  They won't leave me alone.  You think they argue with you or something?  What was going on?  They...  I take my windows.  I nail up my window, shed.  I put wood on the bottom of my doors.  And they still get in my house.  Now, how did this all start?  Do we know?  When I was a child, I guess people would play with them and break their tails.  And the tails would grow back.  That's just terrifying.  Lizards are like...  That's terrifying. 
[02:08:00]  That's what we're supposed to do.  And if the lizard is still getting in our house, she probably should have done better  at school because running into the dog door.  Yeah, what kind of house are you living in?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here it is.  Maury brings out a four-foot iguana.  Oh, wow.  And then to help, in parentheses, Victoria with her feet.  Wow.  Yeah, it can't just be a small lizard as far as it's got to be this giant iguana.  It can't be baby steps.  He just spent the summer cloning a real dinosaur.  Yeah.  Cloning a dinosaur. 
[02:08:30]  To get the right reaction here.  Bring out a lizard.  Bring out a lizard.  Here comes the music.  That's a big lizard.  Wait.  Hold on.  Wait a second.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Again, again, he's blown away by the response.  Well, wait a second.  What?  Oh, my gosh.  He's upset.  No, no, no, no, no.  The video's great.  And like I said earlier, Al Dukes will probably link all these.  But the guy with the lizard is dramatically walking slowly. 
[02:09:00]  Toward her.  Yeah.  And the more she screams, he just continues walking toward her.  Guiding her toward the rug that's covering the lizard pit.  Right.  What's the matter?  Don't go over there.  It's a lizard pit.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Victoria, it's going to be all right.  It's going to be all right.  This bastard, Maury, now that I look at the video closer.  So one guy comes in from the left with a huge iguana.  She runs the other way.  Guess what's waiting for over there?  Another guy with an iguana walking toward her.  Yep.  It's going to be all right.  Stay back here. 
[02:09:30]  Don't get any closer.  Don't get any closer, please.  Stay right there.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll hold it.  Even though I don't.  I'm not happy with you.  Stop it, Mike.  All right.  Stop.  Stop.  Hey, come on.  What do you think this is?  Hey.  Did you hear the lady say she's afraid of those things?  Now, when I say stop it, you guys keep going.  For another five or six feet.  It's the meeting before.  Whatever you do, yeah, don't listen to me when I say stop.  And then I'm going to get madder. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  Yeah.  You just keep coming.  Keep coming.  Right, right, right.  I'm not happy with you.  Stop it, Mike.  All right.  Stop.  All right.  How about the little one over there?  Are you worried about that one?  All right.  Just take the lizards away.  Please.  I don't like the lizards now.  See, they left.  See, they left.  They left.  Yeah, but you caused the whole thing.  On their lizard car.  You caused the whole thing.  Ugh.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  Yeah, Maury's in tomorrow. 
[02:10:30]  We'll be talking about these phobia shows that he's up to.  Paternity shows and phobia shows.  And Pageria.  It's all about the peas.  Freak shows.  Yeah.  He's got the pea shows.  Pageria kids.  Primordial dwarfs.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  They're all starting with P.  Louis C.K., you're MySpace for your...  On tour.  Chewed up many theaters around the country.  That's it.  Louis C.K.  Are you playing Washington on Saturday?  I am.  Okay, cool. 
[02:11:00]  Nice.  And you'll see him down there at the Nissan Pavilion in Virginia.  I got a lot of new clips on YouTube also.  My YouTube channel.  A lot of new video.  Ooh.  Little cartoons and stuff I made.  I'm going to do that tonight.  I'm going to check out your YouTube videos.  Okay.  All right.  We're going to continue on the other side.  If you're not joining us, have a great day.  And have a happy ending.  Oh.  Mmm.  That's a book.  Hey, let's start with Charles in Houston. 
[02:11:30]  We're here at XM Satellite Radio.  Charles, what's up, buddy?  What's going on?  I got a...  Charles.  Yes.  Charles?  Yes, yes. 
[02:12:00]  Hello, hello, hello.  Charles.  Hello, hello.  Charles?  Charles?  Yes.  Charles?  Hello?  What's wrong with the phones?  They are not working.  Why is it the same questions every day?  What's wrong with the phones?  Same questions.  It is.  Hello.  Fucking Groundhog Day.  It's Groundhog Day.  We're just...  What?  The phones.  The phones again.  You know what this is like?  You know, because corporate just doesn't get it sometimes.  You know, they think we could still do a radio show without phones and stuff. 
[02:12:30]  It's like, you know, we should just take their Bluetooth away from them for a day.  They'd freak out.  Or their stupid fucking BlackBerry.  BlackBerry.  And then they'll understand what we go through.  They need the BlackBerry.  Why would that have to be up?  It's usually this button.  Uh-oh.  Can we try it again?  Charles, Houston.  Yes.  What's going on, guys?  Good fix, E-Rock.  Thank you.  Good job.  Yeah.  E-Rock's like Verizon.  He had a button on his own phone.  He's now calling West Palm Beach.  Fucking having trouble with it again. 
[02:13:00]  From there to his apartment in New York.  Mumps neck.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  We got two.  You called him mumps neck before.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, it killed me.  He is.  We got two guys on cell phones.  What's happening, E-Rock?  Come on, E-Rock.  Who are you calling besides not Crunch?  What?  I'm in touch with Mars.  Mars.  No, it's too far away.  The planet.  Yes.  Why don't you call Uranus?  It's more appropriate.  He's trying to call Mars on his phone.  Oh, and there you got Steve over there on another cell phone. 
[02:13:30]  What's happening?  Hello.  I don't know.  I'm calling E-Rock, but it's busy.  I'm not.  We got a Q of the D waiting, and we got a comic with cancer.  We got lots of polarity to get to.  They're all calling each other.  Charles.  What's going on, guys?  We tried the other phone.  Maybe Charles is just a dope.  Maybe Charles is an ass.  Maybe Charles' phone doesn't work.  Hi, who's this?  Any person?  Hi, who's this?  Must be Charles again.  Hi, who's this?  Maybe they're with Charles.  All right.  Well, we're going to get your Q of the D in a few minutes. 
[02:14:00]  I always hated Charles in Charge.  It was a name for a show.  He was in charge.  Charge of being a faggot.  Cunt face.  See?  This is what happens, XM.  You get us just saying cunt a lot.  Yeah, that's our phones.  See?  This is what you get.  See?  This is what you get.  That's what you get.  That's what you would do if you didn't have your BlackBerry.  Cunt.  Yeah, you lose your BlackBerry or the little Bluetooth things.  They'd all just be walking around the office going cunt.  Cunt.  Can I say that?  Or we'll just say space shuttle endeavor over and over again. 
[02:14:30]  We're also waiting for a video to come in.  We'll play the audio portion.  But Louis C.K. is a huge YouTube star, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  There are many YouTube clips now.  And everyone's telling us we've got to play the Catholic Church video.  It's a favorite.  I got the treat.  I got the special treat of seeing that when Louis was in.  Show me on the laptop.  Yeah.  And it's hysterical.  Jesus.  You're going with some sick shit.  The other day, I'm just fucking around on YouTube, and I don't even know how I get 
[02:15:00]  to certain places.  You know, you're on a road, and you don't know where you're going.  You watch one video, and then there's something in the sample window, and you go,  Hey, let me see that.  Right.  And you go in a whole other direction.  Well, I ended up on one of yours, and it's you stealing a child's ice cream and running  into a helicopter.  Yeah, and the helicopter takes off.  And the helicopter takes off.  Yeah.  How did you get permission to even do something that dangerous?  Well, it was, we were using the helicopter for something else.  Oh, okay.  And so I had this idea, right before we take off, can I get this kid, and I steal his 
[02:15:30]  ice cream, and then jump in the helicopter and have it take off.  The thing is, it took off before you were really secured in there.  Well, that's what the, the guy gave me a tutorial of how to get in the door and close  it.  The cool get in as I'm taking off.  Oh, like an action figure.  Yeah.  Nice.  Action star.  The dudes give you the, you know, a safety thing.  You have to get in, you have to pull the latch 15 different ways and close it, and then strap  in.  Before I take off, I have to see you strapped in, and I need to see a closed door.  Yeah.  The guy gave me, in a very authoritative voice, that's what I need to see. 
[02:16:00]  I do not lift off.  The sleds do not leave the ground until you are in, and the door is shut.  And I said, it would look a lot cooler if you would take off the instant I'm even near  the helicopter.  Yeah.  And he said, all right, we'll do that.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  That's cool.  And I thought, the thing is, I was thinking like a guy shooting a comedy video.  I wasn't thinking like the dude who has to do it, because I don't like heights.  I don't like...  Well, you picked a great gag.  I'm not a courageous dude. 
[02:16:30]  And so it didn't hit me until I'm actually, I had a foot on the sled of the thing, and one  foot in, and he starts taking off.  And I was terrified.  Dude, that's what got me.  Like, the bit itself is funny.  I'm watching it.  It's funny.  Louie comes out.  There's a kid eating ice cream.  Louie, there's no real dialogue between you two.  It's just you kind of music.  And then Louie kind of looks around, grabs the kid's ice cream, and runs.  Here he is.  He licks it, runs.  And then I was totally taken out of it by feeling like you were going to die. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  It's like, wait, Louie did that?  Wow, look at that.  You're like an action star.  And then the helicopter banks to the side of the door.  Yeah, banks to the side of the door.  So you could have flown right the fuck out of there.  I was looking down.  I was holding onto the seat cushion, which, by the way, is Velcroed into the helicopter  very softly.  And I'm looking down at water.  Yeah, the thing turned like sideways.  And all I see is just water.  It's just the East River.  It took me right out of the bit itself.  When I was looking at that point, I just went, Louie just did a stunt. 
[02:17:30]  It was crazy.  And then seconds later, we're over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Like, it takes like that quick.  I got to jump in, though.  You don't run like an action star.  No, I don't.  I run like a big, fat retard.  And you do what everyone does when they're approaching a helicopter.  You're crouching down.  You're just crouched.  Except for Vic Morrow.  He didn't do that.  Even though there's plenty of headroom, but we all have to crouch down.  You're giving yourself a few extra inches.  Well, because in order to take off that fast, in order to take off that fast, he had to 
[02:18:00]  be at, the rotors had to be at that speed.  At speed, yep.  It was incredibly loud, and it was, and he did that.  And the kid, and nobody cared.  I was the only one who was like, can the kid be this close to a helicopter?  Yeah, wait, it's by the water.  And people would be like, you could have blown him into the drink.  Were you scared over the bridge?  Yeah, that really bummed me out a lot.  But I did, we did three takes, and by the third one, I was enjoying it.  Oh, you were flying it by the third one.  Like, give me the stick.  You know what, that's a cool YouTube video right now. 
[02:18:30]  That is.  That's something different.  I like it.  It's funny, though, because there's a lot of comments on it, and some of them are like,  fuck this video.  I hate this video.  This was a waste of my time.  Every single video on YouTube has the, dude, this sucks.  It's a way, you could videotape Jesus Christ coming back, walking on fucking water, and  there will be that guy, dude, this is such shit.  This is so good.  This is why YouTube sucks.  Fake, fake, fake, fake, so fake.  And then they'd be fake, fake, yeah.  Yeah.  It's the same comment. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  And then there's the, you know, dude, that's so funny, or this rules, you know, so talented,  that's great.  Yeah.  Dude, this is what YouTube, you know, it used to be cool.  There's another kind of YouTube, another comment that's on every YouTube thing that I have,  which is just a literal reaction to what was done.  Yeah.  Like, there's a few comments on that one that say, like, wow, he really, he took that ice  cream and got in that helicopter.  Wow.  Wow.  He ran.  Yeah, that seems like a lot of, he didn't need a whole helicopter to get away from that 
[02:19:30]  child, did he?  Like, people literally.  Taking it literally.  And you're using a child actor, but some of these dummies, this one right here, oh my god,  that was so mean.  I hope that was just a joke, and you didn't really just steal ice cream from a little  boy making a dramatic escape on a helicopter just for the heck of it, because that would  be mean.  You get every, what it is, is you get a cross-section of society.  You get everything.  You're not just getting people that get a joke, or have a sense of humor, or are stuffy 
[02:20:00]  business people.  It's everything.  So you'll get morons that think everything's real.  Yep.  You'll get people that think everything's fake.  You'll get people that think everything's great.  Exactly.  Everything sucks.  Yes, exactly.  No, the one that I have, the most innocuous video that I have on there, my dog fighting  with a sprinkler, it's been hit two million times.  People love animals.  Yeah, but.  And we wanted to show it at the virus tour, but we can't get a good copy.  I don't have that.  I took it with a little digital camera.  Yeah.  But there's a bunch of people that are really mad at me, because the name of the video 
[02:20:30]  is Louis C.K.'s Stupid Dog.  Because I call my dog stupid.  She's stupid.  She's a dog.  Of course.  And the video, if you haven't checked it out yet, is Louis' dog kind of chasing after  a sprinkler and trying to eat it.  She's trying to drink from a high-powered sprinkler.  I like to think that she's trying to eat it.  She's trying to eat it.  The velocity of the water is turning her head sideways.  Whipping her head to the side.  Every time she bites into it.  Ripping out tea.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Watch.  Then she follows the thing. 
[02:21:00]  She tries.  She's like, eh.  And then she goes.  Barks at it a little.  Yeah, I'm done with it.  All right.  That's how we want to introduce you at the virus tour, but we don't have a good copy of that.  Well, since I put that one has more comments than anything else, and most of them are negative.  People saying, you shouldn't call your dog stupid.  You're stupid because you didn't give her enough water.  That's why she's doing that.  Dogs love things like that.  People saying, you're wasting water.  It's a fucking public park sprinkler near my house.  You got 6,300 comments and four honors, by the way.  What are the honors for the video there, Iraq? 
[02:21:30]  Cruel.  Down, down, right there.  No.  Up.  Asshole.  Most fake video.  It's not even a real dog, dude.  It's the dog in the Pirates of the Caribbean that is holding the keys.  This one is on also.  It was on Keith Oberman.  Oh, my God.  It was on television.  Oh, really?  I just read.  Somebody told me it was an Amazon.  Iraq, honors.  You've never looked at honors on a video?  Why would he know about honors?  Iraq, move the arrow to your left.  Iraq.  All right, now up.  Up. 
[02:22:00]  Directing his mouse.  Stop.  To the right.  Higher.  Right.  Higher.  Down.  Down.  Why?  Down to the left.  Oh, my God.  Right there.  Right.  Oh, duh.  Oh, my God.  It's like a young, retarded child.  I didn't know you could have honors.  I don't even know what that is.  Discussed all-time comedy.  You're in 95th place.  Not bad.  Recently featured, 66th place.  Wow, you're big in Poland.  Recently featured in Poland.  26th place, though.  Let's see what Polish videos are beating it right now. 
[02:22:30]  Ah.  Wow.  All right.  Here's the Polish.  It's by a person doing the same thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  That's funny.  Polish people are watching it going, so that's how you drink from a sprinkler.  Well, you got the joy of shaving beating you.  Go to the first page.  Joy of shaving?  First page there.  Polish videos recently featured in Poland.  Wow, I can't speak Polish. 
[02:23:00]  You speak Polish?  Oh.  Tesla.  Oh, you were.  Tesla coil at Duxin 2007.  Tesla.  South Bank juggling.  Ararat video.  Ah, whatever.  I guess this is.  Ah, crap.  We were hoping.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Sorry.  Damn.  How many hits, though?  That one over 2 million.  It's getting close to 3 now.  I think it's like 20.  Isn't it 2.4 million now?  Wow.  Oh, you're checking every day, aren't you, Lou?  Oh, yeah.  We do that. 
[02:23:30]  How many do I have?  Put my Vista in.  Louie's got 2.5.  Damn it.  Put my Vista in.  How many?  How many?  Anthony had a viral video, too, there, Louie.  He's up to...  What?  What?  1.7.  Son of a bitch.  What kind of faggot video is that?  1.7.  I know.  1.8 almost.  Let's call it 1.8.  It's my Vista when I was loading Vista in on my Dell computer.  The biggest Opie and Anthony video so far on the video.  Oh, yeah.  And the comments on that one are great because it's like, all right, Mac fanboy, won't you 
[02:24:00]  blow it out your ass, you sissy, with your Mac?  And then it's like, you know, and then the PC people are even like, you know, you can't  figure out how to do it.  You know, you got to run the test first to see if your computer's compatible, asshole.  And I'm like, dude, I know about computers.  I did everything.  I bought a computer that was a Dell computer that was Vista ready.  It said Vista ready, but Vista wasn't ready yet.  So they go, when Vista comes out, you load it in, and you're Vista ready. 
[02:24:30]  I go to load it in, wouldn't fucking load, no drivers for it.  And people are going, well, it's not Dell's or Vista's fault, ass.  It's your cards, your video cards didn't have the drivers ready for Vista.  Well, then Vista ain't fucking ready to come out.  It was working before Vista, didn't work after.  It's Vista's fucking fault, not NVIDIA.  You fucker.  I hate that.  And they make it sound like, you know, well, he must have a real piece of shit.  Dude, I buy and sell your fucking piece of shit computers on a weekly basis. 
[02:25:00]  I'm sorry, I have to bring my wealth into this.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Most people were with you.  No, the thing is, this is what I've learned from it, because the Catholic one I did got  the most negative response, because it's very inflammatory.  But even the one I did one about my father, this whole thing where it's a cartoon.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That one's good.  It's just a cartoon of how I can do anything in a cartoon, but it mostly becomes about confronting  my father.  And I get a lot of people saying, you know, you should leave your dad alone.  You probably did his best. 
[02:25:30]  The thing is, I think people's problems is that it's okay to get offended by stuff you  see, but because people get to comment, they think their being offended should matter.  Right.  And it just fucking doesn't.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  If you're offended, nobody has to give a shit that you don't like something.  Yeah.  You can just sit there and not like it and go fuck yourself.  That's why I like that they have comments for people's comments.  Yeah.  Like you can take his comment and then people get ragged on their comments.  It's like, good.  See, you said fuck you. 
[02:26:00]  Now these people are telling you, go fuck yourself on your comment.  Who animated that?  Because that would look like you.  A great guy.  His name is Aaron Ogoblick.  Did he do the credits?  He did.  No, no.  That's David Trisman for Lucky Louie.  But this guy, he does a show called Wonder Shows on MTV.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's so funny.  You're an action hero.  It's like, I can fly.  It's like me telling my father that I don't appreciate his...  Dude, I got something to do.  I can do everything in a cartoon, you know, because I'm a cartoon character.  So he starts doing all these fun things in a cartoon, and then it always ends up him 
[02:26:30]  having some awful confrontation thing with his father.  Yeah.  Stuff that I'm too afraid to have in real life.  In real life.  Is that worth playing, audio-wise?  Nah, because it's all about the cartoon.  You got to say it.  You need a cartoon.  Okay.  The Catholic one's the best one, especially since we're on XM.  I'm going to give you the big plug.  This is what I'm doing tonight.  I'm going to watch all the Louis C.K. videos on YouTube.  Definitely.  It's just, if you go to YouTube.com and then it's just slash Louis C.K., then that's my  channel.  Yeah.  It's amazing that it takes like four minutes to set up, and you have your own channel. 
[02:27:00]  Your own channel.  Hey, whatever you want to say.  It has the same bandwidth and strength as like NBC.com.  Yeah.  That's why the internet scares the shit out of these people.  Oh, this is fucking up TV, man.  And all you need is a little push, you know, some people to catch on to it.  Yep.  And you get huge amounts of hits.  People see things more than they see some TV shows.  Especially if you don't charge money.  If you put stuff out there for free, because as soon as I see that I've got to pay for  something on the internet, it's gone.  Goodbye.  Whatever.  Yeah.  See ya.  Pay for it. 
[02:27:30]  Sure, it's on YouTube.  Yeah, exactly.  Where's the Catholic video?  We got it yet?  It's up there.  All right.  Thanks, Danny.  Let's go to Brian.  He's got a Q of the D for us today.  Brian, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hi, Brian.  Great.  Well, I've got a Q of the D.  Just, why do midgets laugh when they run?  Hold on now.  Let us get a chance to hear why do midgets laugh when they run.  Because their mothers drank during pregnancy.  Let's see. 
[02:28:00]  Hold on.  It's nervous laughter, because they know they're going to die because their hearts are too big  for their rib cage.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on, Lou.  It's a good point.  How about this?  What was the question?  Oh, my God.  Why do they laugh when they run?  They're not laughing.  They're crying.  But because they're cartoonish, we think they're always jolly.  So either way, it doesn't matter.  Mine was close to Jimmy's.  They are crying because they're trotting upon their balls. 
[02:28:30]  Why are midgets...  I think it's the same answer as why do women...  Why don't...  How long...  Why don't women come?  Who cares?  Who cares?  Right.  Why was the midget laughing while he was running?  Yes.  I know, because he didn't realize he was running head-on into a mirror, and he was thinking,  look at that piece of shit headed towards me.  Look at that subhuman...  Look at that short, big-headed shit blob with tiny shoes. 
[02:29:00]  God-hated piece of shit.  Look at that thing that should have been aborted running towards me.  Is that it, sir?  Look at that one exception to what Hitler should have not killed.  Look at that no-basketball-playing motherfucker.  Eat pussy standing up, nothing, running towards me. 
[02:29:30]  Eat pussy standing up.  The poor midget.  Let's find out.  Brian?  Yeah?  Why do midgets laugh when they run?  Because the grass...  I think I got it, though.  I think I did, too.  Yeah?  The grass tickled his balls or his taint or his ass or something.  I wasn't quick enough, huh?  Nah.  Mike in Queens.  Because... 
[02:30:00]  Oh, I thought he hung up.  You did?  Yeah.  It was him.  Who cares?  Mike in Queens.  Who saw this coming?  What do you got there, Mike?  I just saw a midget that looked just like Earl.  He was dressed all in black and just his little fingers dangling out of the sides of his shirt.  Little fingers.  But, I mean, he was an Afro-American midget, all black.  Afro-American.  Afro-American.  Who are you, Malcolm X's speech writer?  Using terminology from the 60s.  He was a Negro.  Do not offend the midget that you're calling in to say you saw because it's funny that he's deformed. 
[02:30:30]  I'm not a racist, though.  The fun in these midget sightings is when you tell us what the little fellow was doing.  What are you doing?  Well, basically, he was just like trotting down the street with his little legs running.  No midget ever just walks down the street.  He's always trotting.  Now they have to trot to keep up with everybody and keep up with life, keep up with the globe.  You never hear, like, what was that midget doing?  He was on the phone making a real estate deal. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  It's never that.  He was washing an elephant with a big broom.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  It's only something insignificant.  The jocularity should ensue after you hear it.  He was dancing with pointy shoes with bells on them.  All right, so you just jump all over, Anthony.  That's okay.  Why do you feel like you have to continue talking there, Mike?  I never understand that.  Well, I was just trying to say something, and you guys started to talk.  Oh, we're sorry.  All right.  Well, obviously, you have something important to say.  So, Mike, what is it?  I'm sorry. 
[02:31:30]  I just thought it was funny.  It looked a little like Earl's mini-me.  That's why I was calling about this midget.  Well, I screwed that up.  Okay.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Thank you, sir.  All right, we got Louis C.K.'s Catholic Church clip ready to go.  Don't mind me.  Why do you have a clicking?  I have to.  What are you clicking?  I ought to turn the thing off.  You certainly should.  Turn the sound off on your iPhone.  Just, uh... 
[02:32:00]  What are you clicking away?  There's a lot of clicking going on.  My girl's still in the hospital, so I have to text occasionally.  Is she listening to the show?  No.  They won't allow it.  They won't allow the XM and the...  They won't allow it.  Uh, today's the big operation.  Yes.  We didn't even give the update yesterday.  She's gonna have her...  Or, uh, this morning.  ...her gallbladder removed.  A gallbladder.  Yuck.  It's one of those parts.  You just...  Yeah.  Ah, you can take that out.  Get rid of it.  Yeah.  Toss it. 
[02:32:30]  Here's, uh...  What is it for queers?  What's called bledders are for faggots.  Louis C.K. becoming a YouTube star.  Here's his, uh...  Video.  Louis C.K. learns about the Catholic Church.  Right.  I was raised Catholic until I was about 10, and then I quit.  Because my parents let me.  But I was always amazed.  I don't really know anything about the Catholic Church.  It's an enormous institution.  Louis, you're producing these things, right?  Yeah.  Why the big microphone?  Is that all you have at home?  That's all I...  Why not hide that thing? 
[02:33:00]  God, I didn't even look at that.  I was so...  Why not hide and make it look a little more natural?  I thought everything was a prop.  The camera just happened to pop on, and you have this thing to say.  Look at this.  I assumed everything was well thought out, and it was like a reason.  Well...  He wants to be Letterman.  Look at this.  Look at this.  He's got the Letterman mic in front of him.  It's kind of like, um...  It was supposed to be a podcast, and I was doing it as a podcast originally.  Ah, okay.  And then it became an HBO pilot presentation that did not get off the ground.  Right.  And I just didn't trade the microphone for anything that looked... 
[02:33:30]  And you're leaning into the microphone because you're not sure if you're getting good sound  out of it.  You had a clip-on lav or something.  Terrible broadcast.  Yeah.  No idea what I'm doing.  Hire a buddy to, like, get one of those boom mics.  A boom mic.  Something.  It would have been awesome.  It really is awful.  Louis is a big star.  Right.  It's supposed to look kind of homemade.  It should just have some big flowery crap on it.  Yeah.  The one that Jack Parr threw out because it looked old.  Wait, what? 
[02:34:00]  What's your excuse, though?  It was just like...  It was supposed to look kind of homemade.  Okay.  And, uh, like, it's just me presenting this shit.  Because I didn't have...  I put the production value into the clips, into the bits.  Right.  And so the tie-together stuff, I made it purposefully.  I don't have any money for this part.  Right.  You should have been holding, like, a long Gene Rayburn microphone.  One of those old game show-ons.  A little booger on the end of a car antenna.  He started radio.  Oh, did he?  No.  That's right.  I was raised Catholic until I was about 10, and then I quit because my parents let me. 
[02:34:30]  I gotta hear this.  But I was always amazed.  I don't really know anything about the Catholic Church.  It's an enormous institution.  Total mystery.  So I just went out and found out everything that I could about the Catholic Church and what  it's all about.  I started here at the Catholic Archdiocese of New York.  I just walked in the door and started asking questions.  Without much effort, I was given an interview with Father Ike McCready, spokesperson for the 
[02:35:00]  Archdiocese.  Uh, so, what is the Catholic Church?  What are you guys all about?  Okay.  The Catholic Church is an ancient, worldwide organization dedicated to the constant goal  of fucking young boys.  Holy shit.  It's a whole...  Did you not know it was coming?  The whole atmosphere in there.  It's a priest.  Very real.  You got the guy as the priest.  It looks like you are in...  We are in a church.  Oh, shit.  And I'm sitting there like, is he using an actor? 
[02:35:30]  I'm not really sure yet.  Yeah, no.  Most people don't know.  I'm trying to figure it out and then all of a sudden, whammo.  Get blammy, yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That's great.  That's, uh...  Hold on.  Worldwide organization dedicated to the constant goal of fucking young boys.  Really?  Sure.  Wow.  I thought everybody knew that.  Well, I thought that the point of the church was to worship God, and the boy fucking was 
[02:36:00]  just incidental.  No, it's just the other way around.  The point of the church is the boy fucking thing.  All the other stuff is just busy work.  Holy shit.  Are they coming after you with torches and pitchforks?  More or less.  More or less, yeah.  Busy work.  Right, Lily.  Oh, this is funny.  Did our friend Bill O'Donoghue get it?  Nobody, he hasn't said it.  There's been a couple of Catholic websites that I've found that have...  The great thing is that they embed the video, like this one Catholic website said, this is 
[02:36:30]  the worst thing we've ever seen.  They embed it.  Oh, yeah.  So you can watch it, and there's links to my website, links to my MySpace.  It's like it's the greatest.  They're advertising for you.  That's awesome.  And it continues.  Okay, so how does it work?  Well, you stick your dick up their ass.  No, no, no, no.  I mean, as an organist...  Holy...  I love it.  What the hell?  We shot this at a church in New York, which I'm not going to say which one it is. 
[02:37:00]  Of course.  There's no reason to cause any problems.  Yeah.  And the guy, because they don't care.  They don't know what we were shooting.  And it wasn't a Catholic church.  It was a different kind of church.  And the priest was a nice guy, and he kept sticking his head in and going, hey, you need  an extra?  I'm kind of a ham.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, no, man.  So you had no idea what was going on in his office?  No, man.  No idea.  Should have been filming porno.  No idea.  You could have been doing porno in there.  Hey, I could, you know...  No idea.  I mean, as an organization, why do you need a whole church just to do that? 
[02:37:30]  You see, you can't just go around fucking boys in the street.  People get mad.  So what we do is we build churches around the world and tell people they got to come  there to pray, give us their money, or they'll go straight to hell.  Now that gives us the authority and the gravitas to control their lives.  Most importantly, to give us their young boys.  So we can educate them, feed them, and ultimately fuck them in the ass and face. 
[02:38:00]  And it's tax deductible.  And it's tax deductible.  Ass and face.  Fuck them in the ass and face.  And YouTube has no problem with this video?  Apparently not.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  It's not even...  There's no warning that it's...  We show a lousy, like, booby or something and our whole account gets deleted.  Maybe it's because there's no visual thing, like a breast or something.  And, you know, you could say whatever the hell you'd like.  It's just words. 
[02:38:30]  That is interesting.  It's just words.  Nobody gets hurt.  I'm surprised to find out that the Catholic Church exists solely for the purpose of boy rape.  But as I did some research, I found out that it's true.  I contacted the Vatican for verification, and I received this written statement from the Pope himself.  We at the Catholic Church fuck boys all day long.  That's all we ever do.  Signed, the Pope.  Father MacReady showed me how the Catholic Church is constantly refining their boy fuck techniques. 
[02:39:00]  So, well, but so what are all these people doing?  This is the only part that is...  This is the situation.  This is where we keep track of all the molesting priests around the world and move them from place to place so they won't get caught.  Let's go.  It's not matching the video.  Father Geegan, you were clear to ask rape a male child in sector 649 are a good day.  This is where you need to see the visuals a little bit, because we found this amazing place that looks like...  Some kind of situation room?  Yeah, it looks like Dr. Strangelove situation room.  Right, right.  It's very, very perfect. 
[02:39:30]  A liar.  Yes.  Someone's evil liar.  Yes.  Lots of computer screens and guys moving pieces around with long sticks.  Is there a reason why you do this?  Purity.  Purity?  Yeah.  You see, the boys come to us and they are pure.  We fuck the boys and take the purity into ourselves.  And the next time we defecate, we create what's called a purity brick.  A purity brick?  What do you do with all these bricks? 
[02:40:00]  We bring it to this paper plant.  Crush them into mulch.  And that's how we make Bibles.  So you're telling me that all Catholic Bibles are printed on paper made from the shit of priests who fuck kids in the ass?  That's it in a nutshell.  Yes.  Wow, that is so interesting.  Well, the Lord moves in mysterious ways.  We went to Staten Island to a real paper plant.  Found a real paper processing plant and shot in there. 
[02:40:30]  It was like 150 degrees in there.  Oh.  The thing was to do it as real looking as possible.  You're so twisted.  That's great, dude.  Very funny.  So are there any boys that you guys have not fucked?  Were you raised Catholic?  Yes.  And were you fucked by a priest?  When did you were a boy?  No, I don't think so.  Wait.  No, I was.  Yeah, I guess I was. 
[02:41:00]  Huh.  We're very thorough.  A little tear in my eye right there.  He starts crying.  Let me ask you one more question.  Shoot.  Is it wrong to fuck boys?  Of course not.  And if it was wrong, now don't you think God would put a stop to it?  Hmm.  I'm just teasing you.  There's no God. 
[02:41:30]  That's it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the only thing you're missing is like there's a graphic description of the...  Yeah, a few visuals in there, but...  Yeah, the boys being...  The purity of the boys being fucked is a whole graphic thing.  Yeah.  Aaron Augerblick, again, the same guy who did the other cartoon, did the great narration.  Wow.  That is...  Did you hand that in to HBO?  I did, yeah.  What did HBO do?  They didn't have a...  HBO's amazing because they don't, you know...  They... 
[02:42:00]  I mean, I can't say a lot about it.  It's dead.  It's a dead project.  But it wasn't because of that.  That was not a reason.  They were like...  They just thought it was too much me.  I was in a lot of the...  Too much you?  Yeah, I'm in everything.  I'm jumping in a helicopter.  I'm doing this.  I'm doing all these things, so...  Isn't that what you're supposed to be if it's your show?  Yeah, but they wanted a little more, you know...  I think they got tired of me after Lucky Louie, so...  Yeah, but couldn't that have been a nice demo, though?  And then you say, all right, we'll reshoot this with some of my friends?  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, also, I handed it in a week after Chris Albrecht got canned, so I kind of just 
[02:42:30]  got shredded in the mulch of shit.  Wow, man.  It just wasn't meant to be.  It was bad timing.  But, you know, I don't care.  The shit's on YouTube.  It's fun having it out there.  And actually, they told me that they got hate mail from Catholics.  Even though there's no indication that it's an HBO bit...  They just figured it out.  They just...  No, they just...  Figured out the connection.  ...went to the nearest corporation to me, because I'm not working for anybody right 
[02:43:00]  now.  Yeah, so...  You can't really get me canceled.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't get you canceled yourself.  Yeah.  There's an overall panic on the instant feedback.  Look, man.  Yeah.  It's something Louis C.K. put together for an HBO project that went...  Didn't go anywhere.  What's the panic about?  What can I tell you?  They're worried we're going to get fired.  Oh, God, stop.  We just aired one of Louis' bits.  So how long before you guys receive a call from the Catholic League?  Oh, my God.  Might.  I could see that happening, but we didn't do anything.  I'm tuning in for something else to listen to in traffic.  I smell a suspension.  Oh, jeez, fellas. 
[02:43:30]  Calm down.  Holy shit.  Louis C.K. is brilliant.  Oh, that's nice.  That is nice.  I like that that's panic, though.  There's a bit of a panic out there right now.  A little panicky.  That was hilarious, dude.  You can check out Louis C.K.'s videos up on YouTube.  All right.  We're going to take our break here and continue with some other thanks.  It's Opie and Anthony.  That's great.  Louis C.K. in studio today.  Great.  Checking out some of his YouTube videos. 
[02:44:00]  You can go to YouTube, just punch in Louis C.K., and you'll see the one we just played and others.  Somebody's asking about the 911 call.  Oh, yeah.  What's that one about?  You can play that one if you want.  It's just a 9-1-1.  It's a bogus 9-1-1 call, and it has the graphics where you see the phone in the background and the voice printed out.  Yeah.  And I do both voices, the operator and the...  Oh, see.  You just answered this guy's question.  Is that call real?  No, no.  How did he do that? 
[02:44:30]  That's so fake.  I did it into my cell phone, and then I recorded it with a microphone off my speaker phone.  All right.  Do we have it to play there, E-Rock?  Yep.  All right.  Here we go.  9-1-1.  What's your emergency?  Help.  Oh, God.  Ma'am, what is it?  Oh, Jesus.  Help.  Calm down, ma'am.  I need you to tell me.  Blacks.  What's that, ma'am?  Black people.  Oh, God.  What is your emergency?  I told you, black people. 
[02:45:00]  Jesus, help me.  That's it?  Just black people?  Yes, blacks.  Where are the black people, ma'am?  In America.  Oh, my God.  Send a car right over.  Send a car right over.  Oh, my God.  That is a lot of you, Lou.  That is a lot of me.  You're playing both parts of that one, too.  Yes.  Do you have any friends?  No.  It's just me by myself.  I think your stuff's going to get a bit of a buzz. 
[02:45:30]  What's the second 911 call?  You know what?  It's probably not fun hearing the both.  I just don't want to be surprised if something that will get as wired as this is what I'm getting at.  I should have asked you a little bit about that Catholic video ahead of time.  Take it something innocent, like a man whose lima beans were spoiled.  That's right.  Something like that.  The second one's probably just boring after the first one.  All right.  It's sort of the same idea.  Good point.  Good point.  There we go.  That means it's real racial.  Yeah.  Or racist, I should say.  Racist, right.  All right.  Want to move on to other things? 
[02:46:00]  Certainly.  Other things?  I would tell him if Merv Griffin is dead, who gives a shit.  The Griffin family, perhaps.  They certainly do.  I would think them.  People he's worked with over the years.  Perhaps care.  Cha-ching.  There goes their meal bag.  Maury's doing the top ten most memorable DNA test results.  What?  Jesus.  He's got a compilation of shit.  Those never get old, either. 
[02:46:30]  No.  Video update.  Well, we got the Vince McMahon thing.  We got another wrestler dying.  We can bring Sam in here, our wrestling expert, and get into this a little bit.  I would like to ask Sam about the wrestling after maybe a few questions about his personal life.  All right.  You know, things like maybe eating.  Can you play Sam's entering, entrance music?  Play his music.  Maybe he'll come in if he hears it.  There it is.  Here comes little Sam.  Sam, he eats like an eight-year-old. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  He eats in his little jammies, right?  Yeah, it's just the food he consumes is the same food little eight-year-olds come up to  their mommy and ask for.  Nothing like steak or burgers or something like that.  It's always got to be something in a neat package.  Like, what are those little sandwich things?  That, yeah.  No, Lunchables.  Yeah, Lunchables.  Like, he would eat Lunchables and things like that.  How old's your kid? 
[02:47:30]  Five is my oldest.  Two and five.  All right.  So she, yeah, I mean, she gets snacks in a baggie.  Yeah, see?  Things like that.  All right.  I can picture him just eating slimy Cheerios all day, like wet from his own spit on his fingers.  And by the way, this is not a bit.  It's real.  Right, right.  We didn't write a list of things for him to say.  And he never disappoints.  We didn't even ask him.  Amazing.  Because you would think we would ask him every day and go, oh, you actually had a burger.  Oh, one day I'll be like, yeah, I had a burger.  Yeah, we don't even ask him. 
[02:48:00]  We just know this works every time.  So with that, Sam, what did you have for dinner last night?  Last night I had fish sticks with onion rings and celery sticks.  Do you have any condiments with the fish sticks?  What do you dip them in?  No, nothing.  No ketchup?  No.  You don't like ketchup with your fishies?  I don't know what I call them.  What about tartar sauce?  Fish bakey?  That's what we call that fish bakey at our house.  Fish bakey.  Fish bakey.  You don't like ketchup with your fish bakey?  Fish bakey. 
[02:48:30]  I could make a smile of ketchup for you.  Oh.  And you could dip it into the smile.  You eat fish bakey.  Fish bakey.  I could make a face with the fish bakey and the smile is ketchup.  And onion rings.  And, of course, dessert.  No, no.  Oh, no way.  Sorry, sorry.  There's a way we do this.  I was out of line.  And what did you wash it down with?  I had a glass of whole milk.  Of course.  A whole milk.  He has milk with everything.  No, not everything.  He doesn't drink milk in the morning like everybody else does. 
[02:49:00]  He drinks milk at night with these awful meals of his.  Fish and milk.  Onion rings.  Fish and fish.  He's so awful.  Fish stickies and whatever.  Fish bakeys.  Fish bakeys.  Sorry.  Fish bakeys.  Fish stickies.  I like that, too.  So, now, what did you have for dessert?  Was that it for dinner, though?  No, like, little baby carrots like you like to eat?  Celery sticks.  Celery sticks.  Just raw celery sticks?  Yeah.  For dinner?  With your fish bakey?  Fish bakey.  Now, where did the celery sticks come from? 
[02:49:30]  Did somebody take real celery and shave it down for you?  Or did you buy celery sticks, like, with a picture of Popeye on it?  Oh, yes.  He gets the ones in the bag, probably.  Right.  Cut up nice for him.  I think my girlfriend cut him up for me.  He did?  You don't even know.  The real answer is he doesn't know where it comes from.  I don't know.  If he was a little more grown up, he'd actually know what the package looked like.  Yeah, no, I don't know.  But he doesn't even know.  Was the milk warm so you could go down for a nap?  No, it's not warm.  Oh, okay.  No.  Come on, what do you think he is?  Yeah.  A child?  Come on, he's a man. 
[02:50:00]  Is he?  All right.  He's showing no evidence of that.  Watch this, Lou.  The dessert is the best part.  What do you have for dessert?  Last night I had gummy cola bottles.  And I swear, you guys gotta believe us.  I believe every word in it.  He does not ask ahead of time.  He never disappointed.  Wait, can you say that again?  Gummy cola bottles.  Gummy cola bottles. 
[02:50:30]  So they're gummy bear flavored stuff that are shaped like cola bottles.  Are they all cola flavored?  Yeah, they are cola flavored.  So it's cola flavored and they're shaped like little bottles.  Do you bite the little lid off first?  Do you pretend to drink out of it?  No, I don't pretend to drink.  There's no liquid.  No.  No, that would be silly.  There's no liquid.  There's no liquid.  Why would I do that?  But he does bite the top off.  Yeah.  But he's a man.  You're in a serious relationship.  Like, when you guys want to go out for dinner, there's not many choices.  No.  Where do you go?  You have to use a kid's menu at the restaurant? 
[02:51:00]  No, no kid's menu.  Mac and cheese.  Where would you go on a date with Jess?  I don't know, like, not quite fast food places, but like an Applebee's or a TGI Friday.  What do you get at Applebee's?  What would you get there?  Chicken fingers.  What about TGI Friday?  Nobody gets at Applebee's crayons.  Yes.  You draw on the table.  And a dinosaur to connect the dots of the dinosaur.  He likes the placemats with the games on them.  That's right.  While people at the other table whisper and point. 
[02:51:30]  Look at the fuck they see.  I did with Jess and I before on some of our dinner dates.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we took him to...  Why would that mic work?  Why?  Oh, you did?  California Pizza Kitchen.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Now, what did you have there?  Was that New Year's Eve?  Was that your...  It was date night.  Cheese pizza.  Just cheese?  You don't like other things on your pizza?  Oh, no.  That's ew.  We can't even, like...  Anthony will take us out to lunch every now and then.  Ooh.  And Sam's...  He'll just...  He doesn't know what to get because it's a real restaurant.  Yeah, we go down to, like, Rue, which is... 
[02:52:00]  Really, like, good food down there.  Right.  And a lot of us get the chicken.  The broiled chicken, which is just amazing.  And he doesn't know what to get.  Or the burgers.  Like, they got great burgers.  Steak, whatever.  Nice sushi.  And he's like, you got fish sticks or...  You don't like a burger?  No, I don't eat burgers.  Why?  I don't need any of this.  He needs a processed, contained food.  No, he really only eats, like, five or six things.  Meak and cheese.  The guys take you for lunch.  Is your bed in the shape of a race car?  No.  No.  Final chance. 
[02:52:30]  What?  How do you not like a fucking burger?  I know.  It's a burger.  Everyone likes a burger.  All right.  Was that it for your food last night?  Yeah.  Now, breakfast.  Now, breakfast.  That's a whole other story.  Now, breakfast, he goes sugar all the way.  Let's see.  What did you have for breakfast?  Well, it wasn't that much sugar because this morning was Pepsi.  Pepsi, sugar.  And pizza.  Pepsi and pizza for breakfast.  He's one of these guys that the second he was old enough to do what he wanted, he did  that.  He did it.  What kind of pizza?  You guys are missing out. 
[02:53:00]  It was cheese pizza.  It was cold.  But was it, like, just from a pizza joint or was it, like, from the frozen?  Elio's?  No, no, no.  This is from a pizza joint because it was left over in the fridge from Saturday.  Oh, so he just pulled it out.  He really is like some kid whose mother shot himself and they found her and him eating out  of the fridge.  She's been dead for days.  And he's just eating himself happy out of the fridge.  That's it.  Last night's pizza and some fish sticks.  You reach an age where you can have cake for breakfast. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  You can have an entire cake for breakfast.  And you just, like, mostly, a lot of normal people don't do it.  Yeah, no.  There's this crossover of maturity that happens when you finally reach an age and you're  like, all right, I can do this.  I can finally eat whatever I want.  But now I don't want to anymore or I know better or I know it's not good.  I have disgusting eating habits.  Do you?  The other day I had one of those cinnamon buns with the jizzy sauce on it.  And here's the worst part.  I was eating it at the airport that I arrived at. 
[02:54:00]  You see, like, how gross.  Cinnabon?  Yeah.  But at my arrival airport.  Oh, I got it.  See, when you're at the departure airport, you can kind of justify, oh, I got to eat because  I'm about to get on a plane.  But I've got my bags already.  I'm 50 minutes from my fucking house and I'm sitting at a table eating a Cinnabon.  Let me tell you something, though.  Making the limo guy wait while I eat a Cinnabon.  I'm not even going to get on you for that because there is nothing like the smell of  that fucking Cinnabon in an airport.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  You're like, you smell it out.  You become a dog and you just, where is it?  Where?  And you know it's just horrible.  It's pure sugar.  Yeah.  Your head is buzzing when you're done with it.  No.  But it's just, it's so good.  And you're nauseous after three bites.  Yep.  But it's so fucking good.  I've never, I don't remember a meal in my life that I've walked away from like, oh, good.  That was good.  Every meal of my life is why the fuck could I just do that to myself?  Why did I do that?  Something about those, they only smell good, though.  Then when you start eating them, they don't.  That's what I'm saying.  There's foods that smell much better than they taste. 
[02:55:00]  You know what it is?  It's a ton of sugar and just like this bleh bleh in you.  It's also the grease.  It's the grease.  Yeah, the grease.  You know what?  You'd be better off just chewing it and spitting it out.  Yep.  But, you know, the swallowing for some reason, I don't know.  Yep.  It's part of the game.  It fills a void.  You ever have those cinnamon minis from Cinnabon?  Kenny got those ones.  Oh, yes.  They're lovely.  They're like little bite-sized morsels.  And the sticks.  They got the little sticks now, too, that are just like that.  But they're not as much as the big frosting one.  And they taste good. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, they're beyond birds.  It is a taste to die for.  And you will.  It just all fills the void that God left when he left the slum.  Sweetness.  My arrival air for air.  That's great.  Wait, you should just grab your bag, leave, and go to a place and get some.  I'm putting them down.  They're next to me at my knees, my bags.  Everybody would understand getting on a flight in your home.  Yeah.  Oh, I got to grab some.  Hey, Sam, what are we doing today?  Are we doing some wrestling updates or what?  Oh, Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  He's had a lot going on in his life.  Oh, he has.  What about the Crush is Dead? 
[02:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  Crush is Dead.  But who was Crush?  Well, Crush was the third member of Demolition.  Now, I remember Demolition having two members.  Axe and Smash.  Axe and Smash.  They were the big get, right?  This is back in the early 90s.  How many were in there?  Three?  Well, yeah.  Axe, Smash, and Crush?  Oh, wait a minute.  There were two.  Eventually.  He's going to explain the third guy.  There were two.  No one remembers the third guy.  Axe and Smash.  Axe and Crush.  Axe and Smash were pretty popular wrestlers back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  But eventually when Demolition started waning in popularity, they brought on a third member of Crush. 
[02:56:30]  Would they think he was going to boost the ratings?  I guess so.  Do they?  Not really.  Oh, wait.  It was originally Axe, Smash, and Demolition.  It was just Axe and Smash.  That was Demolition.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Their tag team name was Demolition.  Axe plus Smash equals Demolition.  Thinking he was going to be like Oliver for the Brady Bunch?  Yes.  You bring in a new kid and it's just going to revitalize the whole thing?  Yes.  Well, here's the whole thing.  Instead, it just gives the dad one kid he can fuck without feeling as guilty. 
[02:57:00]  Boo-doo-doo-doo.  Good morning.  I'm Craig Treadway.  First, Chris Benoit.  Now, Crush.  What cops are saying about the death of former world tag team champion wrestlers.  Wait a minute.  Is the guy really dead or is it another funny thing?  Oh, he's dead.  Are they using the Benoit thing to like, oh, let's now say that a bunch of guys are dead.  See how that's just funny?  He's dead, all right.  A lot of wrestlers have died lately.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The list is pretty crazy if you care to look it up.  Wow.  Here's the story about Crush. 
[02:57:30]  It's quick.  And former pro wrestler Brian Crush Adams has died.  Authorities say Adams' wife found the WWF star unconscious yesterday in his Tampa, Florida home.  Police do not suspect foul play.  Adam's death comes less than two months after pro wrestler Chris Benoit murdered his wife and son before killing himself.  Adams, that sounds like an entertainment report.  Yeah, didn't that?  He's dead.  He died.  And another dev.  His wife found him.  That must be a drag. 
[02:58:00]  He was like the gummo Marx of Demolition, wasn't he?  Yeah.  Like, not really the top billed ones.  He was the one who had a girlfriend.  The other ones were funny.  Reference of the day right there.  He was the curly Joe Besser.  Not even Zeppo.  No.  Not even Zeppo.  Fucking Zeppo is ruled compared to gummo.  Gummo.  We got to play this again.  Stay there, Sam.  We're going to go back to you.  We're going to go off-road for a second.  You said it sounds like an entertainment report or whatever. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  You got to hear this news clip.  We played it earlier.  We played it yesterday.  We can't get enough of this.  Oh, I love this guy.  This reporter is laughing his ass off as he's, like, reporting this story.  That's all I'll say.  It's Jay Warren out of Nebraska.  A fire crash leaves three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say a rental truck carrying two people.  Lost control, crossed the median, and collided head-on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me. 
[02:59:00]  The two people in the rental truck and the driver of the semi.  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  We're killed.  Crews say they had fires contained in about ten minutes.  Was he fired immediately?  I mean, immediately?  We don't have an explanation.  He said that he laughed because somebody was holding up pictures of the victims.  I got to hear it again.  The pause.  That one, he goes, the people in the room? 
[02:59:30]  In the room.  He can't say rental truck.  But can't you turn a laugh into a cry to save your job?  No.  There was a point there that he realized.  He must have been fired.  Dude, it was right from the start.  You could hear him losing it.  I don't know if you saw the two helicopters that crash into each other because those people  are fucking idiots.  The news copters.  The woman, the anchor, I don't know if you could hear the guy dying.  The scream, I know.  You can hear him screaming while she's going, well, we're just going to go back and see  what happens.  I know.  And she's icily. 
[03:00:00]  You hear that like, ah!  You hear like, ah!  It's like a cartoon screech.  Get me both.  You rock.  And she's over it just being so professional that there's ice in her veins.  Well, we're going to see what happens there.  Well, we'll go back and see what happens.  My best friend just died.  I'm like, they might have had a touch of a problem.  We'll be back after these words.  Pay some bills.  And the guy in the booth is like, nice one, Monica.  Yeah.  Good one.  Good way to handle it.  Here's the truck guy again.  You could hear right from the beginning that he's losing it. 
[03:00:30]  He's starting to laugh.  Oh, yeah.  You can hear the quiver in his voice.  A fire crashed.  There's three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say a rental truck.  Seriously?  Two people lost control, crossed the median, and collided head-on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me.  He zinked.  And he's like, excuse me.  Like, he gets mad at himself.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  And then when he's trying to say the rental truck, he goes, the rat.  The rat.  And then he can't even deal.  Oh, boy. 
[03:01:00]  Tom and Philly, Curly Joe, Dorita, and Joe Besser.  There were two Curly Joes, weren't there?  Sorry.  I don't...  Well, there was Curly.  There was Curly.  There was Curly, but then there was Curly Joe.  Who was one of the Howard brothers.  Yeah.  With Shemp and Moe.  This guy's exciting.  And there was Larry Fine.  I think so.  You can correct the premise.  And then there was Joe Besser.  And then there was Joe Besser.  And then there was Curly Joe, who was the guy.  Oh, I'll pinch you.  I'll give you such a pinch.  That's so hard.  Yeah, yeah.  That guy.  Didn't he suck? 
[03:01:30]  He was awful.  That was when Moe was like...  Except for fucking Curly.  Curly was the only funny one.  Shemp was hilarious, dude.  I love Shemp.  I didn't like Shemp.  Oh, Shemp.  I didn't like Curly.  Shemp?  You were a Shemp guy.  I preferred him to Curly.  I like Curly.  Curly actually had funny lines.  Yeah, Curly did have funny lines.  There was one where they're being proper, you know, at a proper party.  Of course.  And so, what's his name?  Moe says, oh, Curlington.  And Curly says, yes-ing-ton.  He's making the word yes into an aristocrat. 
[03:02:00]  One time he shot...  Yes-ing-ton?  He shot some guy's toupee came off his head and shot it.  He goes, oh, a tarantula.  And he starts shooting.  He goes, you just put five shots into a divot.  Moe.  I liked Moe, but he was scary.  Moe was pretty funny, yeah.  Moe scared me as a kid.  When I was a kid, I thought he was going to hit me and make me cry.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, Moe is the nasty one.  And then once they all got old, it was just pathetic to watch them slap each other. 
[03:02:30]  And that's when they started bringing on, like, I'll give you such a pinch.  Yes.  Like, that guy.  And they were all, like, old Moe.  And just don't hurt each other anymore.  Stop.  Lots of makeup.  Wrinkled gray hair.  Yeah.  Watching some young couple kiss.  They just end up becoming the back story to some fucking, oh, they're in love.  Hey, they're in love, Moe.  Yeah, exactly.  Curly.  Larry.  Larry was just there to get hit.  Yeah, exactly.  Larry added nothing line-wise or anything.  He was just there for Moe to beat. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  One of my favorite moments, but I think it was Moe, it was Shemp did it to somebody.  Somebody was on a ladder.  And, like, you know the things that you'll use to, like, I'll say, wash a window, like that  type of a squeegee.  Yeah.  I forget who, it might have been Moe who did it to Shemp, but he's on top of the ladder  and Moe's on the ground and he takes the squeegee and he jams it up in a Shemp's face  under his nose.  And just to see a squeegee, jams, it was poetry.  There was some great violence on there.  Ah, you can't do violence now. 
[03:03:30]  There was a comedian.  That's the only stuff that's timeless.  Violence is timeless.  Violence.  Well, they're taking it out of cartoons.  They really have a problem with violence now, too.  There was a comedian in Boston named Mike Donovan who never left Boston, but he was great.  And he had a bit about that there should have been one three-minute episode of the Three  Stooges, they're plumbers, and Moe says, give me that pipe, and then he hits Curly with  the pipe, and Curly goes down.  He's just dying.  And then you see Curly, Moe on the stand going, I didn't know it was going to hurt him. 
[03:04:00]  He had another thing about how Hogan's Heroes should have been one episode and same thing.  Yeah, same thing.  Just Clink and the Gestapo guy are talking, and Hogan goes, yeah, but the dancing girls were  great.  And the Gestapo guy goes, Clink, have this man shot.  And then you just hear, in the background.  General Bullcott, huh?  Yes.  General Bullcott.  He's coming.  Yeah, they'd have Gestapo come there, and Hogan would be swaggering through the POW camp.  Just hanging around.  Hey, hey, how you doing?  I got an idea. 
[03:04:30]  Could you hang him, and then we'll shoot him, and all of his men.  Actually, first, shoot his men in front of him.  Yes.  Start with the little French one.  Make him fuck his sister, and then sew them together, and then kill them both.  See if he's got something funny to say then.  See if he's got a witty comeback to that.  See if he's got a crack wise, or try to pick up my secretary.  After we lop his friend's hands off.  Make him eat them.  Why, Hogan, why did you do that? 
[03:05:00]  Back to the truck story.  Oh, yeah.  So when does he lose it?  Right away, you're saying?  Yeah.  After the first sentence, you can hear the voice.  Yeah, he lost it.  A fire crashed.  These three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say a rental truck carrying two people lost control, crossed the median,  and collided head-on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me.  The two people in the real truck, and the driver of the semi. 
[03:05:30]  This is a sad story.  You don't try to finish the story.  No.  You don't continue to pollute their deaths with your laughing.  That's why I'm thinking you do that.  You stop and say, I can't do this right now.  I'm having some problems with my throat.  Can I hand this off to Nancy?  Yeah.  Or something.  And you grab some water and do a spit tape.  You don't laugh through it.  When she says they're dead.  All right, back to Sam.  He laughs through it.  Imagine the family might be watching that one.  Well, they don't contact everyone who loves the guy. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  They contact his wife, and that's it.  So somebody who fucking really cared about the dude in the semi found out by a dude laughing.  Why is he laughing?  That was horrible.  All right, Sam.  Oh, back to you in wrestling.  We're back down the road.  All right.  Vincent McMahon.  Well, yeah.  We have nothing else on Crush, right?  No, just the...  He was the third guy because we were trying to spice up...  He had a solo career for a little bit, but it wasn't...  Stop. 
[03:06:30]  You know?  Basically, we don't know who he is.  Didn't really pan out.  His face makeup looks a little too much like the ultimate warrior, like half ultimate warrior.  Hold on, I got an idea.  Would wrestling fan cry over this guy's death?  No, probably not.  If E-Rock isn't crying, then...  E-Rock, we got the crying audio for Louie?  Oh, you mean that wrestling guy?  That's what I mean.  If wrestling fan...  He would cry over this.  Would he cry over this one?  I don't know if he'd cry over this. 
[03:07:00]  Dude.  I don't know.  He'd have to.  He's such a douche.  You've probably seen it.  It's a great video of a wrestling fan in the stands at some local gym, and he...  He's on wooden pull-out bleachers in a gym.  And there's four people around at tops.  The bleachers aren't even full.  And there's some wrestlers there giving interviews.  Yeah.  And he stands up and starts talking, and boy, he's got some stuff to tell them, and he can't  quite contain himself. 
[03:07:30]  Are they talking about the wrestler who died here or something?  Well, I think he's emotional because of Owen Hart's death.  Or any Guerrero?  I think this was Guerrero.  Oh, this was Guerrero, right?  Yeah.  Guerrero.  Yeah.  All right.  So now it's like, this is the benchmark.  Would this wrestling fan cry over Crush's death?  He's a big, fat guy.  He's fat.  He's like, wrestling is his life.  And hold on.  This is a douche chill.  Ready for this one?  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies. 
[03:08:00]  It's still real to me, damn it.  I mean, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  You're awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thank you.  Oh, my God.  I loved it.  I looked at Louie during that, and I just loved the look of disgust on Louie's face when  he was like, you're a brother.  Oh, God.  It's like, oh, what is he doing? 
[03:08:30]  Do you know what would be perfect?  As he's talking, if out of frame, a shotgun just entered and blasted his head off.  Yes.  No, he just made his death unsad.  He just made his life dispensable.  Crying wrestling.  It should be like a rule.  If you do something that dumb, you just become branded as murderable.  That's it.  Anyone should be able to just wipe him out.  Yeah.  Then you have to be careful how you fucking act.  Because if you do something that dumb, then you just get up. 
[03:09:00]  It's like registering as a sex offender.  Yeah.  When you move to a new tenure, it's okay to murder me.  You won't go to jail.  Yeah.  No one's going to care.  No one cares about me.  Useless cunt I am.  In the old days, you used to be able to make a complete ass of yourself, and it just passed.  It was a moment.  Yep.  And maybe a couple of people had still pictures, maybe a grainy piece of audio tape at most.  Now, that guy is forever.  He's on the Opie and Anthony show.  Going to be, right.  It's huge.  He is forever.  We had him on.  We had him on.  We beat him up pretty good. 
[03:09:30]  Forever going to be on the internet.  Do you know more about what happened?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to, or else you'll shoot yourself.  Dave from Manhattan, he writes, a crying wrestling fan would cry if he found out that Vince McMahon  wasn't a millionaire.  He would be saying what needs to be said.  A billionaire, actually, yeah.  He would cry at everything.  So, what are we saying?  He wouldn't cry over Crush's death?  He wasn't a legend.  He was more of a kitschy.  Kitschy.  Hey, before I put the old crying CD back in. 
[03:10:00]  He was like the Louis Soho of wrestling, sort of.  Oh, Louis Soho, old bass and hound face.  He's a good player, though.  He's a good little utility player, but his face should be smashed.  Hit 240 every year, did fine.  Nice fucking, a nice hot waffle plate against him.  Exactly.  A little fat face.  A little better than I would have been, basically.  Before we put this back in its CD case, we've got to play Mike Schmidt, because it's out.  It's out in here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Before we put it back in the archive.  The crying audio.  Mike Schmidt retiring.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees, and a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, God.  Who's laughing?  Those are the two anchors that were watching a model, runway model, fall down on one of their reports. 
[03:11:00]  Really?  She fell down, and they couldn't stop laughing.  They played it over and over again.  It was like they were doing a stupid radio show.  Do we have to play that now for Louis?  Yeah, I do.  It's very...  Do you have the models?  Yeah.  All right, we got that one.  This is fashion week over in Paris.  The latest fashions are on the runway for next spring.  That's how she falls, too. 
[03:11:30]  Does it twice.  One of the British designer's shows had the difficulty.  A model fell down twice.  That's her going down once.  The young woman wearing that pink skirt and the orange platform shoes.  Never quite recovered after that.  There she goes.  That had to hurt.  That was uncool.  That's embarrassing.  This is at least the second time.  Well, you all are just really tickled by that. 
[03:12:00]  I'm sure.  You try to open it in those shoes.  First of all, baby, I got enough meat on me that it's all right.  George.  I'm sorry.  Come on, man.  We went outside.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's coming again.  It couldn't be.  Where in the world is that? 
[03:12:30]  DC.  It's in Y2.  Oh, that's awesome.  I love those guys.  What's great about it is the wobble that she does trying to keep herself from falling.  It's like a newborn fawn.  It is one of the funniest falls you'll see.  That's great.  Because she really tries hard not to fall down as she wobbles back and forth uncontrollably.  He knew he was laughing and he still said, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, here it comes  again.  Look right here.  I apologize, but don't pause it.  I got to see this again.  He wasn't a broadcaster.  He was just a fucking guy watching a chick fall down and laughing his balls off over it. 
[03:13:00]  By the way, Mike from Minnesota.  Louie needs to buy an XM radio.  The listeners are sick of us replaying the other game.  Sorry, guys.  Just for Louie.  You got to play for Louie.  It's weird that it happens on the show, though.  It's just like what people do out there.  You have something cool you got to share with your friends.  You want to show your pals.  We know a lot of the people listening right now have heard these clips a lot of times,  but it's like we get excited that we get to play for Louie for the first time.  No, and I listen to this show, too.  It's just a joke.  I just enjoy hearing him still.  I don't know what it is about me. 
[03:13:30]  I'm retarded.  Now they're requesting gay weather, man.  You've seen gay weather, man.  Gay weather.  We're never going to get to the Vince thing.  Which one's gay weather, man?  With the cockroach?  Oh, yes.  I have heard that one.  Oh, where he screams.  We should finally stop.  What about Angry Katrina Weatherman?  Angry Katrina Weatherman?  Where he was trying to tell the weather, and he was going on a little too long.  He was getting interrupted, man.  And the anchor woman was trying to cut him off.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because it was Katrina, and the weatherman freaked out, thinking it was all about them.  Like it was their day to shine, man. 
[03:14:00]  I'm a weatherman.  I'm a meteorologist.  This is my day.  You know, keep your other stories away.  And he got so into these details about barometric pressure, no one gave a flying fuck about,  that the anchor was like politely trying to step in there.  Right.  Oof.  He didn't appreciate it.  I haven't heard that.  You got that one, E?  E?  E to the R?  He's looking for that.  E to the R.  E to the rock.  I go E to the R to the O to the C to the K.  It takes a while.  To the O.  That way.  To the OC.  Phil's time. 
[03:14:30]  To the O.  To the OC.  E to the R to the OC.  Rock.  Coming back with the K.  Yeah.  To the K.  Yeah.  Everyone seems to be able to come up with cool little names for themselves with initials  and two names for one.  I know there's the Oaks got one.  What do I got?  Well, the team.  The team.  The team.  You and your girlfriend.  No, I don't know.  Oh, I like that.  No, I don't know.  That's fantastic.  No, I don't have that.  You do? 
[03:15:00]  That's the team.  He calls them themselves the team?  I've heard...  No, no, I don't have that.  I've heard Club Soda Kenny use it a lot.  Yeah.  Well, they combine their names.  They combine their last names together and that's what he calls...  Team that?  You mean like it's a recent name?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's a combination of the two last names.  They're just lying.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Not lying.  Not at all.  What will happen is...  Hey, you're an honorary member.  I am.  Of course I am.  When we went to Detroit.  I'm proud to be an honorary member.  I love being a member.  Of what?  Team Hugo. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I love it.  Oh, a proud member?  Yeah.  We know Opie's last name.  We won't say Lindsey's, obviously, but it's a combination of the two names.  So it comes out, Hughes.  Hughes is the first one.  And then, yeah.  So it's Team Hugo.  It's like, where would Team Hugo like to eat dinner this evening?  Like it's a secret service. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Team Hugo.  But the best is when we'll say something, and I say we because I'm a member.  We'll say...  Honorary member.  I don't know.  I still want to be a full-time.  Team Hugo, moving out.  Right, right.  And then just start walking.  Team Hugo, moving out.  Right.  It's time to go.  Look how red Opie is.  He's getting a little warm.  Jared from Atlanta writes, hey, why don't you guys show Louis C.K. the one where Kennedy  got shot?  That's old.  That is a good one to watch.  All right.  Here's the...  That's an enhanced.  Here's the CNN weather guy.  He's a bit on the bitchy side. 
[03:16:30]  On edge.  It's his day.  He used to be on TV when I would get up in the morning and watch a little TV.  Not anymore, huh?  I don't know if he is.  I haven't checked out CNN in a while.  Go.  But the storm was 902 billabars.  902 was the lowest that you had with the storm a couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit.  Could you pause for a second?  Filled in with some air.  No?  Yeah.  Dillabars.  You know what it is, too?  It's like...  This is Katrina.  So they want to show pictures of masses of black people out of their homes and floodwaters. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  That's what they want to show.  Helicopters pulling people out of roofs.  You want to see the guy that was outside of the Superdome pointing at a corpse in a wheelchair  and saying, I wouldn't treat my dog like this.  Right.  That was Katrina.  They want to get right back to that coverage.  Billabars.  So they go to the weather guy, and he's talking like millabars and stuff.  And the woman's like, you know the producer, the director's in her ear going, get off this 
[03:17:30]  guy.  Let's go back to the action.  Find a way out.  But this guy thinks he's the shit.  Uh, people suggested I change the team name to Team Douche Chill.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, God.  Sorry.  Thanks.  Didn't mean that inadvertent kicking your ass under the bus, Hope.  Thank you.  Team Douche.  Team Hugo.  You're a queer.  Great.  Now you know why I was turning red.  Team Douche Chill.  Great.  Douche Chill?  Yeah.  That's the apparent shiver that a woman will get when that cold water goes up into her 
[03:18:00]  pussy.  Oh, I never heard that before.  She gets a chill.  Yeah.  Wow.  A little douche type chill.  Wow.  Is that a real thing?  I think it's, uh, you could equate it on the male side with, um, what you call a piss  shiver.  Piss shiver.  You ever take a piss, and that's warm liquid leaving your body.  Right.  So you kind of, as you pissing, you go like, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You get that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  It's just, it's a stink shiver, because the stink that leaves their, when the stink leaves 
[03:18:30]  their box.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  Oh, women have to have to, it's a dry heave.  They're so foul, they have to spray foreign liquid into their cunts.  It can make it livable.  Livable.  Could you clean out that fucking, that garbage fucking bar?  Or for women that don't do it, and their husbands don't like it, it's a box kick wince.  The wince they give when their husbands kick them in a box.  You know what a cunt is?  It's a fucking, it's a garbage barge folded over like a fucking Dorito, or no, a fucking 
[03:19:00]  burrito.  That's what it is.  It's a folded up barge of garbage with fucking, with an afro on the end of it.  Pelicans flying around it.  Exactly.  That's what a cunt is.  It's Staten Island folded up like a piece of pizza.  It is.  But you can't even clean it out with a giant magnet, because nothing's metal in there,  unfortunately.  It's all just, it's all fetid.  You don't appreciate the woman.  The finer parts of a woman.  They have to fire a fucking, like a, just liquid in there to clean it out. 
[03:19:30]  I've got a fucking spray for wasps just to get near it.  You need that long distance hornet spray.  You fog it first.  Like everyone, I don't work on my Mustang for about six months in the summer.  And they'll make nests under there, under the hood.  Yep.  You need that long range.  All right, back to the scene.  Weatherman.  Yeah.  With the, what is it?  The billow...  Dillibars.  Millibars.  Millibars.  Dildo bars of pressure.  Sam's still standing there with his headphones on. 
[03:20:00]  How awkward do you feel?  Here's more of the Weatherman.  More Dillibars.  It's filled in a little bit, filled in with some air, not as low of pressure, but Camille.  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk.  Okay.  Camille.  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as strong as Camille, but not really as strong as it's been. 
[03:20:30]  908.  I'm walking over here because you're, I can have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  908 millibars is 26.81 inches of mercury.  This storm got down to 26.61, and right now it's 26.98.  Now, if you would go to your home barometer that you have, it's probably a big circle hanging  on your wall.  Home barometer?  You go look at that.  That is completely off the screen.  Rarely would you ever have to have a barometer that would go that low in the northern hemisphere 
[03:21:00]  unless you were obviously trying to.  Nobody has a barometer, you fucking gay cunt.  All right.  Just having fun with you this morning.  Just having fun with you this morning.  Like, you can't even be honest and just say, look, it's my moment to shine with my mercury.  My inches of mercury.  If we're going to go down this road now, we've got to go with anchor people that fight.  Oh, I want to hear that one.  We've got two really good ones.  But that guy got so flustered after she, like, told him off that he couldn't get anything.  I've walked over this chart now, and the millibar inches, this was 28 inches of mercury. 
[03:21:30]  This thing, oh.  People stutter for a reason.  Yeah.  His heart was racing.  He was fucked.  She fucked him over.  He pulled that ear bit off really hard and said, if that cunt talks to me again, next time  there's a catastrophic hurricane, I want my rights.  Yes.  I mean, she cuts the balls off all the time at one, too.  Like, fucking hell, you have a Pepsi.  She goes, oh, Chad, don't you know Coke is what men drink? 
[03:22:00]  But he thought he had something for real for once.  No one.  That city was wiped out so I could show off my community college education.  Yeah, watch me talk about, like, the barometer.  Find your home on it.  It's probably that round thing on the wall.  And then you look around and go, fuck, that's been a barometer all this time?  I've been getting to work by, like, 96 inches of mercury.  We had one on a lamp in our living room, and that stoop thing barely moved.  It went from here to here.  Did it seem fair?  Stormy?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what you need.  If you're going to go out and go crabbing, if you're on the deadliest catch, you need 
[03:22:30]  a barometer.  Basically, if it went off the charts, you just knew you were fucked.  The apocalypse was happening.  Even barometer makers made just funny things on their barometers.  They realize no one gives a shit.  You put numbers on there?  Not fit for man or beast.  We're reading from Whackbag.  This will end the whole team thing.  Opie, how about you name your team after you and her ages?  So you can be Team 15.  You.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  By the way, if you can't find your barometer at home, look in that fucking, look in that  folded septic tank that your gal calls a twat.  It's probably falling in there.  Caved in septic.  What is your problem with women today, Jimmy?  I love women.  I'm saying a vagina that needs to be douged.  Oh, one that needs to be douged.  Yeah, I'm saying a stinky.  I thought you were saying any vagina.  I want to clarify.  I thought you meant any vagina.  No, he's talking about an unkempt fucking wild woman pussy. 
[03:23:30]  Of course.  Then I wholeheartedly agree.  Yeah, no, no, no.  A filthy pussy.  No, that's what I, in general, I think the word cunt is a weird word for a vagina because  a vagina, a decent one anyway, is like little flower petals.  Like you hear a piccolo in your head when you see a vagina.  Yeah, yeah.  Diddly.  Nice flower petals.  And then they say cunt.  Yeah.  If I may jump in, then think of a pool slide that's been left under a tree and all that  stuff fell on it and you got to hose it down.  Yeah.  It kind of looks like that as you're just shoving water up that. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  No, or like a giant vagina that's eating a town and the National Guard is shooting at  it and it's not helping at all.  Even when you're fucking a healthy looking one, you pull your dick out, it's got like  fucking little milk marks around it.  You're like, what happened?  You pussy up manic depressed taking fucking Haldol?  It's that like white shit that fucking manic depressors get in the mouth.  I get a fucking milk ring on the end of my dick, you slime bucket.  You're a fucking chicken that's got those slug snots on it, white slug boogies. 
[03:24:30]  Can you fucking hose this hole out, please?  We got anchor fights.  We should start with...  I love these anchors that just go at each other.  The LA ones?  That's the big get.  So let's go with Bill Evans.  Weather guy Bill Evans arguing with the anchor while Laurie Stokes just sits there.  Yeah, the anchor...  Wait, the anchor and the weather guy go at it over the name of Trump's wife.  Okay.  There it is.  Have you seen this? 
[03:25:00]  This is a big dress.  Something old, something new, and something that costs about 100 grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for a supermodel, Melania Nels, the former or the  future, Ms.  Ellis.  Wait, wait, go over that name again, Steve.  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it?  Why don't you do it?  No, I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Then I piped on over there during the video, wouldn't you?  Well, then what then, Steve?  Go ahead, do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me. 
[03:25:30]  I just...  I wanted to know what you said.  If you're not the anchor, then don't...  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The gown was designed by John Galliano for Christian New York, and the bride plans another  dress of Euro-wing design after the couple's first dance.  Wedding is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it a shot there, Bill?  Hey, I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing...  I'm just representing the audience.  My bad.  My bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for an apology, son.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another shot at it?  No, I wouldn't.  I can't take a shot at it. 
[03:26:00]  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold.  It is cold.  A nice one.  A little bit here, too.  You fence-mending cunchie.  She really is.  I don't know how many times she had to explain why her mother had a black eye.  Oh, dad fell.  He's okay.  It's all right.  Fucking codependent slob.  Why don't you just let the two men duke it out?  Oh, it's cold out!  And the guy goes, it's cold in here, too.  Exactly.  A little honesty, at least, out of the two anchors. 
[03:26:30]  God damn.  That back and forth.  Why don't you do it, Billy?  Hey, Billy.  You want to take another shot at it?  Take another shot, and I'll take a shot at you, you son of a fuck.  We lucked out on that one.  We were just rolling tape.  Yeah, we just happened to be rolling tape watching.  We used to watch them every morning.  That one didn't make YouTube or anything, that one.  No.  That's awesome.  That's a great one.  And Bill Evans won that war.  That's great.  Because Steve is now gone.  He's not on that station anymore.  Yeah.  They're both kind of right.  Yeah.  They're both sort of right.  Yeah, the weatherman should have kept his fucking mouth shut.  Yeah.  The guy kind of stumbled over some words.  Who cares?  It's not this show where we pick at every little fucking thing anyone does wrong. 
[03:27:00]  And the anchor, I don't know.  Yeah, he should have just shut up, too.  It's good that he stuck out for himself, though.  You don't let a guy just...  He did.  And then Bill...  He thought he would make the little comment, you want to take another try, and then the  anchor would go, yeah, I know.  Yeah.  And he went, no, why don't you do it, Billy?  It's a lot of hard to do with the weather.  It's not my job.  All right, here we go.  Here's the big get.  This is from 1994.  It's out there in L.A., K-A-B-C.  This is the two anchors going at it just before they go live. 
[03:27:30]  Right before live.  So how did they get...  So it was just the tape that leaked?  Obviously, some guy that didn't like the anchors and said, you know what?  Did it win on the air or the...  No, no, no.  Their mics were live, so they're rolling tape forever.  And, yeah.  Some engineer smuggled this one out and said, fuck, this is too good.  It's obvious when they go to air.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  Do you hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining because tonight I said hey. 
[03:28:00]  Then we better talk about it because I think you've got a problem.  I agree.  I think we've got a problem.  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show, and we'll talk about it with Roger Bell.  Because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me like that's the way I'm going to do it.  The way it's going to go in.  I'll take the ante up a little higher than that even.  You're not only wrong, you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal. 
[03:28:30]  If you want Harold Green, you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters, and I don't know what the fuck happens.  Well, when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's nuts.  Some nights it is, Ann. 
[03:29:00]  When news happens, you see it on Channel 7.  The number one station for news and information in Southern California.  Now, Paul Moyer, Ann Martin, Johnny Mountainweather, and Todd Donahoe Sports.  This is Eyewitness News tonight.  Three men dead tonight in an exhibition-style room in Los Angeles.  There he goes.  Fucking pros.  Right into it, man.  That guy's a professional.  Imagine it's like an old fucking married couple just sitting there.  That was good. 
[03:29:30]  Picking at each other.  That was a good one.  That was good.  He accuses her a-drinking.  That's right.  And she keeps...  They both keep their cool.  Yeah.  Neither of them stumbles.  No.  Like, she's totally confident.  She's like...  Way out of line.  Not only...  I'll take the ante up.  I'll take the ante up a bit.  What about the pounding of the table?  Oh, wow.  He's like pissed.  I don't know who Harold Green is, but that's awesome.  You want Harold Green invoking that name?  Oh, boy.  I don't think you want to be in front of that guy.  The great Harold Green.  Good old Harold Green.  Good old Harold Green. 
[03:30:00]  There's a pause where the fight's really over, and then he decides to go.  Yeah.  You go home, and you get a couple of shooters in you.  A couple of shooters in you?  Yeah, she's like, fuck this.  I need a drink.  I picture her looking like Dean Wormer's wife.  He's doing a couple of shooters.  Fuck it.  I have the goddamn senior honors dinner tonight.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  We need a breaking news sweeper.  We don't have one.  And Sam's still standing there with his headphones on.  I'm looking silly.  Waiting to talk again.  You need a hostess cupcake?  A little fruit? 
[03:30:30]  Are your legs getting tired?  No.  Fine.  Yeah, Drudge is reporting.  Radio host Don Imus has agreed to settle with CBS for $20 million.  Holy gee.  And a non-disparaging clause legal sources claim the move opens the possibility Imus will  soon return to the airwaves, possibly on WABC in New York.  Developing.  Developing.  Let me ask you a question.  Wow, it is on the front page of Drudge right there.  Yep.  Did they owe him $40 or $50 million?  Because he got his first year's pay.  They owed him $40 million. 
[03:31:00]  $40 to $50, yeah.  Yeah.  He got half of it, and he gets to move on and make more for somebody else.  Yep.  It's not a bad deal.  Not at all.  $20 million.  $20 million.  He just made $20 million for saying that yet at all.  Yes, he did.  $20 million and out of his contract.  If you think about it, if you think about it, in the end.  $20 million for nothing.  Because that.  Wow.  And now re-signing for probably more.  Re-signing for a minimum of five a year.  Whatever.  Way more than he would have made if nothing happened, because he's dwindling now. 
[03:31:30]  He's not growing, but now he'll grow.  Well, now, it boosted his career.  Yeah.  He was on the other side of it, absolutely.  But now, for the next year, people all are going to want to hear what he has to say.  Wait.  How long do you think he'll have to sit for?  Like, would he?  That might be in it.  I'll probably.  Well, they've been hinting that he's going to come back in January, so someone already  knew that he probably has like a four or five month no compete.  For that settlement, though, that might be something where they say, look, we'll give you  $20 million.  You've got to sit out. 
[03:32:00]  Remember what they did to us?  Dude, he's already sat out.  And another four or five months, we'll take him to January.  Because everyone's starting to say he's coming back in January.  But he just signed.  It'll be retroactive to something.  He had just signed.  What if they give him that money, but make him sit out for the rest of his contract?  He wouldn't agree to all the money.  He wouldn't agree?  He wouldn't agree to that.  He's like 60-something.  He can't wait five more years.  He just signed a five-year deal.  What if it was a year?  Dude, he had a good case, too, man.  Yeah, I know.  He had a really good case.  So he had a lot of negotiating power on his side.  His contract said he had to be controversial. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, and had to be warned.  Right, right.  There were all kinds of things.  So he said, no way.  I'm going to go for the whole lump.  And they said, all right, how about this?  We'll give you half.  It looks like it's about half of what they owed him.  Maybe a little less than half.  And maybe he said, look, instead of sitting out the five years, we're going to make you  sit out another four or five months.  And then you could go.  And because they've been saying January, January, January.  January is the winter book.  I know this is a little inside for people, but the fall book is really important for everybody.  Let me explain why.  See, 26.5 inches of mercury is when the fall book is. 
[03:33:00]  If I could, if I could, let me talk.  Oh, shit.  Chad was such a cunt.  No, because.  Stupid Chad.  These little things have been coming, surfacing the last few weeks, and everyone's been saying  January, January, January.  So that's probably it.  Probably want them sitting in the four months.  Yep.  Where are we at?  Like August?  Yeah.  Yeah, another four months, four and a half months.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds about right.  Wouldn't it be funny if he came back and just trashed us and shit-talked us and destroyed  us in the ratings?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, they're hacks. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a lot of cowboy hats for $20 million, baby.  Baby.  He's going to have some nice things to say about us when he gets back on.  Is he?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you what I think of that man.  He's an old codger.  Yeah.  Now we're going to have to really compete with him when he comes back, because a lot  of people are going to be tuning him in.  And Sam still stands there.  He has nothing to say.  What's the matter, Sam?  I'll ask you.  What do you think of the new... 
[03:34:00]  Do you like the direction Vince is going in, or do you not like it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I like it.  No one cares.  Here's the clip, because some people...  This is what Vince had to do.  What happened, Sam?  Let's get it over with.  Well, last week we found out that Vince...  There was a paternity suit that Vince has an illegitimate child by somebody, and he  doesn't know who the child is, and he doesn't know who the woman is.  That is impossible.  What?  Because of his many discrepancies throughout his lifetime.  Did he fuck Pat Patterson and the Duker? 
[03:34:30]  And the Duker.  And the Dukie.  And we found out last night that he lost his virginity at the age of 12, so it could be  Wow.  Anybody.  Wait.  He said that?  Yes.  But this is all being...  Wait, he lost his virginity at 12...  But this is all being written by WWF writers, isn't it?  Isn't this all just...  No, it's real shit.  No, it's real.  Oh, God.  Oh, sure it is.  You know what, Dad?  You're sick.  You're absolutely sick.  You're the one who faked your own death, then got slapped with a paternity suit by a woman 
[03:35:00]  you don't even know.  And acting.  She's always been horrible.  She's very good.  Shut up.  See, earlier today, I came from the plaintiff's attorney's office.  She did.  And it seems as though your illegitimate child...  It seems as though...  My half-brother or sister is standing around this ring right now.  Was Vince making a face?  Like, oh, I...  I don't believe it!  ...is a WWE superstar. 
[03:35:30]  He's a wrestler.  One of the wrestlers is Vince's son.  We don't know who.  Come here, baby boy.  There's gonna be a big alliance once they hook up.  This is my new family!  You can go to hell!  Coco, beware!  Oh, no.  Deep Dark Secret about to be revealed.  That's right!  I got jungle fever!  It's so weird when you see it during the wrestling matches when they play backstage things.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  And it's something in an office where some guy,  I'm a lawyer from this company.  I'm talking loud for no reason.  We're in a little office, but I'm handing you these things.  These documents.  Oh, my God.  And there's cables around and lights because nobody cleaned the setup.  And the guys always want to be like someone that's in the organization as a wrestler.  So they're always too big to be what they are.  He doesn't fit the suits.  Hi, I'm the eye doctor.  I'm here to examine one of the guys.  And he's got, like, pythons.  No, it's like porn.  Wow, the guy's like porn. 
[03:36:30]  I've got a mask tattooed to my face, but I'm an optometrist.  Which one's my boy?  Who do you think it is, Sam?  Yeah.  It could be anyone.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Help us out.  Now, wait a minute.  This is the same fucking gag as the car blew up.  They just took the car blew up.  Yeah.  Because, remember, it could have been any one of the wrestlers.  So they brought them all out and were like, who blew up Vince?  We'll try to kill Vince.  And then when Benoit decided to go loco and kill his family and himself, they couldn't 
[03:37:00]  do the death angle.  So Vince comes back and they come up with a new angle to a mystery that involves all the  wrestlers.  But it's the same, yeah, it's the same gag.  Who is it?  Faking his death being outed by reality of Benoit's death should destroy the whole thing.  But it doesn't matter.  Whose mother did I fuck?  It could literally be called fake wrestling.  This is all fake.  I swear to God.  And they would say, whose mommy did I tell?  Get on your knees. 
[03:37:30]  Get on your hands and knees and bark like a dog.  He loves doing that.  We love the over-the-top Vince.  Take off your bra and take it off now.  Right.  I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.  Who's my baby boy?  And I'm gonna do it bareback.  That's right.  No rubber.  That's right.  My sperm swim.  So you have no idea.  No.  Well, he said he faked his own death because.  Who looks like Vince? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Who?  They gotta look like each other, right?  Well.  It's gonna be Triple H.  And then that makes it even sicker.  Oh, my God.  Because then Triple H is married to his daughter.  Right.  Which would make some big incestuous sick thing.  Well, they're trying to get ratings up in Alabama.  That'd be good.  Finally.  He did look long and hard at Mr. Kennedy.  Who the fuck is Mr. Kennedy?  George Kennedy, the actor?  Loved him in those airplane, airport movies.  I pride myself in knowing some of these guys, but who the fuck is Mr. Kennedy? 
[03:38:30]  Mr. Kennedy is a big superstar right now.  Is he?  Dr. Kennedy.  He has his wig removed with a shotgun whenever he enters the ring.  Or in the kitchen on the way in.  They shoot him.  So it's him?  No, I'm saying it could be.  It could be The Miz.  The Miz was in Detroit.  It could be him.  Why didn't we ask him?  The Miz is a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  He wrote all about the virus tour on his blog.  I read it.  It can't be someone old.  We know it's not like...  He lost his virginity at 12. 
[03:39:00]  And how old is Vince?  He's got to be 60.  You're just stalling.  I just got to communique.  So they're doing this so it could be anybody.  No, I got to communique.  Sorry to stop you in your tracks, but it's coming in.  Ask Sam how Mr. Kennedy introduces himself, and supposedly he could do the yell, whatever the yell is.  Well, he just shouts his name.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  He goes, Mr. Kennedy. 
[03:39:30]  Kennedy.  Oh, my God.  This guy is not real.  No, he doesn't.  What the fuck?  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, the mic comes down from the ceiling.  Like an old boxer.  He pushes the ring announcer out of the way.  He won't let anybody else announce it.  He announces himself.  Wow, that's terrific, Sam.  It gets the crowd moving.  Oh, I bet.  A lot of people are suggesting that Vince's son is the Undertaker. 
[03:40:00]  That Vince, like, fuck him.  Oh, fuck the dad or something?  He went to the cemetery.  So they made him lose his virginity at 12 so that it couldn't be anybody.  Yeah, and then there's no one old enough to be, like, 50 and wrestling.  Well, Ric Flair was standing right behind him right after he said 12, and they said,  that means it could be anyone.  And then Ric Flair was standing right there, but I think Ric Flair is a bit out of the age  ring.  Maybe.  I hope so.  Although Ric Flair looks a little bit like this Mr. Kennedy. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Is that him?  Yeah.  He looks like a younger version.  Looks like a younger version.  Can we hear it?  Is there a relationship there?  No, no, no.  Let's see how good of an impression Sam did.  Let's go.  Mr. Kennedy!  Kennedy!  What a douchebag!  What do you mean?  Douchebag!  Mr. Kennedy is a big superstar.  Mr. Kennedy's a tool.  Wait, there's a retarded character? 
[03:41:00]  Eugene?  Yeah, well, Eugene is.  He has special needs.  Stop it!  There's a retarded wrestler?  He comes out in a superhero outfit.  Come on.  All right, find him.  Find him.  Is that Vince's son, you think?  Wow, the layers.  No, he actually plays Eric Bischoff's nephew.  That's how he got the job.  So there's too many relations there?  He just does other wrestlers' moves because he's such a big fan.  So it's probably the retarded one, then.  Does he talk funny?  Yes, he does.  Do we have any of him? 
[03:41:30]  Oh, no.  I didn't even know what's going on with the WWE these days.  My God.  I'm going to have to start watching.  What a calamity.  I got to find out whose son is Vince's.  Yeah.  Oh, who even needs the wrestling part?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's crime time there with you.  Crime time?  And super crazy.  Could it be crime time?  See ya!  Yo, all the numbers.  All the numbers, baby.  Yo, yo.  You want to be in a room?  What?  You want to be in a room?  You want to be in a room?  You want to be in a room?  What number you want? 
[03:42:00]  It's for Arena?  Yeah, for you.  You want a number?  Yeah, give me any number.  Any number?  Because I am super.  He's super.  I am crazy.  He's crazy.  I am super crazy.  He's super crazy.  Come on in here.  He's got Rich Voss' old haircut.  And mental capacity.  Dinero.  Mucho dinero.  Come on, baby.  Come on.  He's Mexican?  He looks like J. London, doesn't he?  Yes.  200.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  Here you go.  Check it out.  Every Saturday.  Come on.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  They're taking advantage of this.  That's crime time.  I'm just saying.  He's a retarded Mexican guy with the Mexican flag on his chest.  No, that's you, G.  No.  That's the slow one.  Oh, here he is.  Okay, G.  You got any money, you, G?  Come on, baby.  You got money.  Come on, G.  I don't have your money.  You got money.  Oh, my gosh.  They're acting retarded because they're talking to retarded guys? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  They had to cast retard, by the way.  This guy passed the audition to be retard wrestler.  Oh, my God.  Since you special, I got a special number for you.  Yeah.  Bam!  Oh.  Calm down.  I'm number 30.  I'm number 30.  Yes.  Yes.  Eugene.  Eugene.  He's not a good number in the world.  No good number.  No, no, no.  Not in the world.  Eugene, you want to be number one.  We can make you number one. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  You want to be number one?  You want to be number one?  I'm number one.  You want to be number one?  Oh, my God.  Why?  It's crazy.  It's a really old version of a retarded person, too, that he leaves out.  He talks like a caveman.  Because retarded people don't talk like that.  No.  Me got good number.  They don't talk like that's how they made fun of them in the 40s.  Me got good number.  Me got good number.  Good number.  No, retarded people, they don't talk slow like that.  They don't leave words out and talk like a fucking prehistoric human. 
[03:44:00]  Mr. Fishbaking!  Fishbaking!  Coming in.  Fishbaking!  Fishbaking!  Fishbaking!  That's Grizz Few, I guess.  Last names are for dummies.  Thank you.  From Massachusetts.  Let's do line of the day and get the vote.  So they haven't gotten any crap for a retarded guy?  He's special.  He's not retarded.  Oh, okay.  You do that shit on the radio, you got special interest groups going nuts.  But, you know, Vince could kill wrestlers or whatever the fuck you want.  And that's on national television.  That's all over TV. 
[03:44:30]  Like regular family television.  He gets away with murder.  Literally.  I mean, team Hugo!  Hugo!  Hey, hey, hey.  Hugo.  You had your fun.  You had your fun.  It was funny.  We got lines of the day?  Yes, three runners.  All right, here's a runner-up.  Are you ready, E-Rock?  Yep.  E-Rock had a bad day today.  Oh, yeah.  He's had a bad day since fucking 2004.  It's about time you had a good day. 
[03:45:00]  Fucking Amish beard, flesh neck.  Here's a...  Yes!  Bill Rizzuto has died.  Yeah.  What a shock.  The scooter.  The scooter.  What'd he die of?  I like that the Yankees have to confirm it like he's their property.  Yeah, what the fuck?  It's not the Rizzuto family.  Confirmed by the Yankees.  It's just another move by the Yankees this year.  Before the trade deadline.  They're going to use his prostate.  We've decided to let him die so they can bring in Whitey Ford as a consultant. 
[03:45:30]  His prostate's going to be used as the fucking pitching rosin.  You know how he died a fucking mule kicking through the front window of the money store?  The money store.  That's right.  We have money here.  And a fucking...  A little mule just put his foot right in his chin.  Holy cow, I don't think I'm going to make it.  Poor Phil Rizzuto.  He was a good announcer.  What, too soon?  Two seconds?  He was walking out the front door and fate said, stop right there! 
[03:46:00]  And he grabbed his chest.  And stopped.  That's right.  Fell face first.  I hope Cora was watching, too.  His wife that he always talked about, his stupid old man glasses fell off.  The scooter can eat my ass.  The scooter.  I used to love the scooter.  His awful stories.  They were great.  Yankees would be losing 14 to 1 and he'd be talking about his nephew and you wanted to  slice all their throats.  Shut your fucking doddering mouth.  We're getting killed.  He would sneak out to beat traffic. 
[03:46:30]  Of course he would.  Those stories came out.  Oh, God.  He didn't want to get stuck in that Yankee Stadium traffic.  So he would sneak out of there.  He would sneak out with an hour or two to go.  Frank Messer had to change his diapers.  He was lying.  He didn't have to get out of traffic.  Bill White and Frank Messer, he would smell like shit.  He would doody in his pants.  They'd be like, could you get this fucking cryptkeeper out of here?  Put him on the fucking Van Wick and shit his pants in his car.  Bill White was, he was good, too.  I love Bill White.  I love.  And Mercer. 
[03:47:00]  Well, Bobby Mercer was after, but Bill White.  But he was a good one, too.  When I was a boy, it was Messer, Bill White, and Phil Rosado.  Yeah.  The scooter.  They all worked together.  Frank Messer.  Bobby Mercer.  Oh, okay.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  World's oldest woman died.  And, you know, this happens.  Yeah, whatever.  The world's oldest vagina is in the ground now.  Wow.  I didn't even think of that.  Yeah, Louie!  New angle! 
[03:47:30]  That was a very good angle.  Just buried now.  Just sitting there somewhere six feet under.  Louis C.K., the YouTube star.  Oh!  Oh.  Your phone.  Everyone's got such weird, uh...  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Let's see what Polish videos are beating it right now.  Ah.  Wow.  All right, here's the Polish...  Quiet person doing the same thing.  Oh, boy. 
[03:48:00]  That was...  That was great.  That was very good.  And we're not explaining.  Listen to the replay.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  He was like the Gummo Marx of Demolition, wasn't he?  Like, not really.  The top-billed ones.  He was the one who had a girlfriend.  The other ones were funny.  Reference of the day right there.  He was the Curly Joe Besser.  Not even Zeppo.  No.  Not even Zeppo.  He...  Fucking Zeppo is ruled compared to Gummo. 
[03:48:30]  Gummo.  I like how they just end.  We're all staring at our phones.  Maybe we should...  Everybody's checking PDAs.  It's like the clip is playing and we're just all staring at our various phones and PDAs.  It's time to go.  Here's our line of the day.  The fuck out.  Here...  Here...  Here...  Comes...  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  We're...  We're...  Oh, no. 
[03:49:00]  He's got a sore throat today.  He's just got a swollen throat area.  Certainly does.  His throat is sore from having fish lobbed into his mouth.  I'm queer every day.  Ah.  Beautiful.  Paul.  All right.  What plugs need to be done?  What do we got?  Louie?  Go to your MySpace for your tour dates.  MySpace slash Louis CK.  Tour dates all over the country.  Chewed up is the name of my tour. 
[03:49:30]  Theater is everywhere.  Nice.  Jimmy?  I'd like people to buy happy endings because I want to stay on the best solo list.  And I'll be in Boston at the end of next week for a signing.  All right.  Going to Boston.  Boston Mass.  Let's make it easy.  We're out.  Hello.  This is Louis CK.  And you are right now listening to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know you, but I fucking...  I hate you right now.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
