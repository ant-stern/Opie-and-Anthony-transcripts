<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts reflecting on the previous day's incredibly funny show, featuring Rich Vos and Bobby Kelly, contrasting it with the anticipated less exciting current broadcast.  Opie recounted a near-paralysis incident during a vacation, expressing anger at negative Twitter reactions from people he called "apes" and detailing his strategy for blocking them.  The conversation shifted to Jim Norton's frantic trip to Los Angeles to film a Jay Leno skit after Terry Bradshaw's cancellation, highlighting Norton's furious response to flight delays caused by severe weather. Opie then showcased (and later admitted to faking) photos of a possible waterspout/tornado in New York City, prompting joking confrontation with E-Rock.  Financial disagreements with their employers, Opie's past poverty contrasted with his current wealth, and the viral fake storm photos were also discussed.  The hosts reviewed the "Death Wish" movies, criticizing the later films and commenting on the actress who played the daughter in the fourth movie,  and similarly criticized Stan Lee's "Superhumans" show.  The segment concluded with discussions of disasters and the public's fascination with them, including anecdotes about Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami, laced with crude humor and references to bodily functions.

The show then delved into a segment heavily focused on voyeurism.  Opie, Anthony, and numerous callers shared explicit stories of observing neighbors engaging in various activities, often nude or sexually explicit, using binoculars, security cameras, and even a Barrett .50 cal sniper rifle. The descriptions were highly detailed and graphic.  One caller, "Striker," detailed repeated observations of a 17-year-old neighbor, claiming a friendship with the girl's father.  Other callers recounted similar observations of neighbors, babysitters, and witnessed sex acts.  Jim Florentine was a guest in studio during this segment. The conversation also revisited the frantic efforts to get Jim Norton on the Tonight Show, detailing the stressful airport journey and the meticulous transport of a valuable autographed Black Sabbath poster to be signed by Bill Ward,  including considerations of airplane closet space.  Further sexually explicit listener calls and anecdotes punctuated this portion.

The next segment centered on Jim Norton's obsessive pursuit of autographed memorabilia.  The hosts detailed Norton's meticulous methods, including special pens and his intense focus on lighting and angles for photos.  Anecdotes about Norton's attempts to get photos with celebrities like Mark Wahlberg (phone call only),  a hypothetical encounter with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Metallica, Ace Frehley (who left before Norton could get a photo), Carol Burnett, and Selena Gomez were recounted.  The difficulties with lighting, camera malfunctions, and celebrity availability were highlighted.  Norton's apartment, described as a "museum" bordering on hoarding, and the struggles of an interior decorator to make it livable were discussed, as was a picture of Marilyn Manson he obtained at an awards show. The latter half focused on Blind Stevie's disastrous errand for the "Morning Mashup" crew â€“ a failed attempt to get Dunkin' Donuts, resulting in Tim Hortons donuts and dirty money.  The hosts' reactions included insults and jokes, leading to a humorous challenge for Stevie. Sam, another staff member, also received blame for various incidents, including accidentally calling 911 multiple times.

The final segment featured comedian Tommy Tiernan as a guest, after an apology for making him wait.  They discussed a CNN story about a woman who threw acid in her own face, initially finding it humorous before learning the context.  Tiernan discussed his experiences in America versus Ireland, his controversial jokes and resulting backlash, cancelled tours, a performance at a bar with "girls with leather bras," and the differences between American and Irish audiences.  Political correctness and the challenges comics face were also discussed.  Blind Stevie's Dunkin' Donuts debacle was a recurring comedic element. A lengthy interview with Ira, a weatherman, touched upon Yom Kippur, Sukkot, his experiences with women of different races, and a recent severe weather event in New York City. The show concluded with promotion of upcoming events, including Tiernan and Florentine's shows, and Ira reading humorous tweets from 50 Cent.

[00:19:00]  duped a lot of people on twitter and a lot of people in the media yeah i was big i was uh i was a part of  the big scam the statue of liberty picture so now the other picture iraq you gotta be honest man  all right give me a second let me tell you because you even said i can't wait to see your video because  part of my scam was saying look this is a still from the footage i took outside my window i'm editing  the video as fast as possible but as we sit here 6 30 obviously there's no video because i didn't put 
[00:19:30]  it up on my youtube channel so now walk me through this and don't make me look like an asshole  because it sounded like you bought into this no the a lot of people did by the way you're not the  only one i will tell you this when i saw the first one which was the statue of liberty one you could  see the edges the second one yeah when i looked at it this morning i was like oh and i really didn't  give it enough thought but you kind of got me on the second one there all right so you're right  you're gonna admit it now and then i said i didn't see your video but see the one yeah i haven't edited 
[00:20:00]  yet right i didn't bring it up any further past that right because you're waiting for the video  i honestly thought there was a video okay there you go all right he's fessing to the yeah the video  i definitely thought there was because technically you do have a you do have a view from your apartment  that can face that way you didn't not only do i have a view but it looks like that could have been  the hudson river but don't you see the scan lines and that he's taking a picture of a monitor you 
[00:20:30]  can see his reflection in it i think if you look it was early i didn't look close enough at that  one and i fucked up because the cursor's in the picture yeah that's that's i i i wanted to get it  uh no i didn't even see the cursor till you pointed that out what you think it was yeah a rocket ship  it's an arrow yeah i fucked up because i i wanted to get it on twitter as soon as possible but  fuck i got a lot of people yeah picture did very well out there in the twitterverse twitterverse  yeah oh paint me red well you are red right now who's got 800 gallons of paint 
[00:21:00]  yeah so the uh the two pictures i posted obviously fake but uh iraq wasn't sure about the second one  especially still waiting on the video yeah yeah are you waiting on the video see that looks like it  could be jersey in the background right yeah it could be the midwest in the background there's no  landscape or buildings well that's because the clouds are covering up all the buildings on the  jersey side there finger of clod  but the one from 1976 got a lot of people a lot of fucking people there is that a real picture from 
[00:21:30]  1976 i would guess tornado come approaching new york and uh going by the statue of liberty  yeah that's probably a real one yeah it just looks old too it's got like an oldie look to it  yeah but when when when it's a storm picture you don't know because everything's dark around  yesterday like maybe it's possible yeah it was some fucked up weather though huh what's some 
[00:22:00]  fucked up weather though a lot of hail and thanks iraq like uh uh downed tree limbs actually what  happened with uh to me the real story i'm an idiot because i saw the i live i live pretty high up  and i looked out my window toward the jersey side where the storm was coming from and i see  really dark clouds and i go to myself you know what if i leave now i think i can make a loop in  central park what do you think on my bike these things move like fucking yeah i do the big loops 
[00:22:30]  in central park as you know as many days during the week as possible so i'm like i think i can get  one in so i jump on my bike and i go and i'm a i'm about three quarters of the way uh through my  bike ride yeah and all sudden that fucking thing hit dude i've never seen rain as hard as yesterday  it was like a wave of water i can't even explain it i mean obviously we're talking to a lot of people  that lived through it yesterday or whatever and and the hail there was some hail not a lot in uh 
[00:23:00]  central park i'm not going to make it more than it was in central park because yeah because that  wasn't the the where the the main storm went through but it was the edge of the edge of it  obviously so i saw the hail and then i'm under a tree just getting fucking pounded at first i'm  like i got a nice spot for this storm i'm not getting wet and then the rain was so hard it  didn't matter where you were you just got completely soaked and then and then the lightning is right  above central park or probably in the distance but it felt like it was right over central park and 
[00:23:30]  it was one right after another too it was unbelievable i was stuck under this tree probably  a half hour to 40 minutes as this thing went through mm-hmm yeah crazy crazy weather what  did it do on long island uh it knocked down some trees and shit and uh power lines my power went  out for like i don't know five minutes i'm top priority you know they get that shit turned right  back on they know they know the people that pay their bills really some of the other neighborhoods  not so lucky you think you think that's how it works oh yeah i think that's how it works that's 
[00:24:00]  exactly how it works they look and go who pays the bills and then they look and go oh good okay  that neighborhood we'll take care of that we'll leave these people in the dark for a while right  it is unbelievable what they do to the poor people oh really poor poor people  poor poor people hey man i was i was poor most of my life so was i most of my life when you look  at a chart of my life most of those years were fucking pretty bad it's very i mean the 
[00:24:30]  graph really tails up right at the end here you get that you look at the entire life on a poverty  scale uh mine tails up very very close to the end of the uh scale of age so far you get that social  security thing yeah where they show you what you made yes what you made every year of your life that  you've worked man that is a weird thing to look at isn't it i'm trying to i'm trying to explain what  mine would look like i mean there were there were multiple years multiple where i i didn't make 
[00:25:00]  more there was no income where i didn't make more than ten thousand a year dude i have years  where there's none because i was working off the books installing pools well granted i i had some  off the books money myself because i was a caddy but caddy but multiple yeah and then i was squeezing  almost 20 for um almost a decade and then all of a sudden whoop you know what that would be a good  thing to do to show something without having to actually reveal finances is to just do a graph  uh a little chart like a stock graph right uh from the time i started working till now and just show 
[00:25:30]  how long that graph was at the bottom right before it tailed up and because i i was very poor for very  long and these motherfuckers around here are doing their best to try to get us back down back down to  fucking ground level they certainly want a big spike somewhere they absolutely want that roller  coaster to make its way back down fuckers enough of the right they want the part by the way i didn't

[00:28:00]  talking about how it was a fake picture and now i'm hearing huffington post i hate the huffington  post you hate the huffington post it's gotten so popular now it's being used a lot yeah online  as a source of information and i hate looking at it as according to the  huffington post but now now i'm hearing the picture from 1976 might be an actual picture from 1948 that was 
[00:28:30]  what that that was pushed along back in 1976 so now that picture could be close to 60 years old  tell from the statue of liberty well the statue of liberty has been the statue of liberty for  when they build that base i know it was just kind of standing there for a little while do we have  info on the uh the big statue of liberty tornado picture danny 76 they're saying it's definitely a  picture from 1976 all right yeah yeah i wasn't i don't think i was i wasn't the main guy but i  definitely pushed that along and and that picture went everywhere yesterday fucking everywhere yeah 
[00:29:00]  because how could you tell it's the statue of liberty right it's a funnel cloud right there's  nothing in there that says what year it is yeah so good good for them i just tweeted a few things  about uh what i was watching that's pretty much all i tweet these days unless i could be outside um  no you're stuck inside just watching television your tweets were funny yesterday i was tweeting uh 
[00:29:30]  you want to officially follow each other or what it probably should well i click an engagement  but i told you you're part of you're part of my funny people list you don't do lists yet no i don't  even know i i just don't listen are way better than following people yeah yeah because you put  everyone in categories i got a categories i'm gonna start a category called apes just all the  fucking apes that i have to interact with i i have my definition of ape is different than your  definition all right it really is i figured that i don't know how to do the um the list categories 
[00:30:00]  like i have a news list so it's all just like news people and and you know that type of thing and  then i got like all the funny people yeah a lot of comedians and and and i even threw like pat  from minaki in there because he's a funny he's a funny fuck and i have a few others i'm trying to  think i got world leaders world leaders yeah you got all these fucking weird world leader guys and 
[00:30:30]  they're tweeting just dumb stuff it's really strange people shouldn't in a lot of languages that i just  don't understand though there there are a lot of people that probably just shouldn't tweet like  we're just dopey fucking radio guys so it doesn't matter if we tweet something and it's stupid or silly  or whatever uh but world leaders once you get on record like that that shit just follows you true  so maybe you should just lay off it used to be you used to have to step up to a microphone and give a  speech uh in order for people to know what you're thinking or and you could think it out and right go 
[00:31:00]  over it with your speech writers and now on a whim some guy may be having a couple of beers and he's a  world leader can just start tweeting fucking what he thinks about another country start a war i'm gonna try  to get this up real fast i want to see what the world leaders are talking about today world leaders  yeah instead of like leading the world yeah what are they tweeting i don't know i can't get to my  twitter because all i was tweeting was like um well i was a fourth installment of um death wish  is it is it four we talked about three yesterday is is there a crackdown drop off from three to four 
[00:31:30]  even dude it's all shit after one really like and one if you watch it now is silly but two three it  just and but they do get worse as they go along because uh death wish four the crackdown they start  at four they started getting the subtitle it wasn't just death wish two dash with death wish three  right now it's for the crackdown and it was about like cocaine and cocaine dealers and of course um 
[00:32:00]  you know uh paul kersey he's there at the beginning and say he's got a chick and his chick's daughter  um uh is uh this young girl a young girl and she goes to the the video game place at the movie theater  or something and uh buys some cocaine and she ods and dies oh boy i've seen more character development  in a pamphlet really than what was going on in this movie as far as the daughter characters the daughter 
[00:32:30]  they actually had a get a scene where charles bronson and the the girl's mother are in uh the  living room and she goes she really loves you and thinks of you as a dad well i like her and that was  like how that was the emotional connection between uh bronson and the daughter that that's it you  didn't see them interacting really that much or anything that was the setup so you feel for the 
[00:33:00]  daughter you felt nothing worse aside from the fact that she was kind of cute and had nice tits when  they were trying to give her a cpr right um on the table they pulled her shirt down a little bit  um she's actually the girl that was in christmas vacation she played the daughter you know the  interchangeable daughters in the vacation movies i'm trying to remember which daughter it was for  christmas vacation it was uh obviously not the original one juliette lewis it was the original  right no no the original was dana uh something she wound up she had some kidney problems and wound up 
[00:33:30]  dropping dead what i want to know that next time i watch one of these vacation movies sorry that's why  i can't watch meet the parents anymore the girl with the bloody nose that gets hit in the pool with  the fucking volleyball oh dead it's hard to watch poltergeist too because you got kidding two dead  girls in that one i think i think both of the daughters dead that's uh dana wait a minute she's  another dana baron no no no not her wasn't she the original is that the original no no no i think 
[00:34:00]  juliette lewis was the original no was it the second one i don't know hold on i know one of these  one of them are dead i didn't know this was it the second one no it was the first daughter  isn't that the daughter maybe not audrey yeah audrey's the daughter yeah of course randy queen  was in this one audrey chriswell european vacation the original vacation are you on dana hill 
[00:34:30]  that's the dead one that's european that's european who wants no way no one watches that  one okay that's the third one then it was the third one okay she's dead the original one though  okay she was the one in the original you watch the original one then you go christmas and then  maybe european yeah yeah it's kind of a drop-off of that one big drop-off okay so original one was  dana baron and she was in she was the chick in the movie in death wish 4 and then the second one 
[00:35:00]  was juliette lewis right juliette lewis in the second one she was excuse me she was in christmas  vacation well they couldn't hold a fucking daughter in that franchise would that or a son or a son right  yeah rusty rusty was different rusty was casted uh because anthony michael hall was the original  rusty christmas vacation right on they just replaced the fucking son and daughter yeah  who cares whatever so that girl was in yeah she was in as the as the daughter right the tragic 
[00:35:30]  daughter right that uh got to paul kersey all revved up to kill drug dealers right but uh he was a  kind of um bamboozled into doing it by a guy another drug czar or another drug dealer guy so um  oh just tragic a lot of people dying and paul kersey again at the end kills the lead bad guy  and i mean as he's still blowing up because he gets him with a grenade launcher well because the 
[00:36:00]  death's got to be more oh yeah yeah it's got to be that big he's like the um use the the the boss at  the end of a game right when you're killing like the little thing and then you get the boss at the  end of the game and got to kill him you got to get some shit to kill the boss that's how the 80s  movies were right you got the the big boss at the end and the second i mean his body fragments were  still hitting the the floor and the credits are rolling they just killed him over that's it that's  it paul kersey again walking off to where tonight death wish five my friend and this is the last 
[00:36:30]  one in the installment yes thank god last night was atrocious i couldn't even deal with it death  wish five he's got to be fucking 80 years old in this fucking movie what year did it come out i have  no idea they showed him running in death wish four and climbing up a ladder and it was just like oh  he's gonna hurt himself you can tell his back's bad oh it's just horrible now i gotta watch all  the death wish movies i haven't watched those in years oh kersey long long fucking time i'm the  vigilante oh yeah he looks fucking old man he's just old his face looks like a apple that was left 
[00:37:00]  out of the sun a little too long he has a shrunken apple shrunken apple he uh he does and and just  watching so many of these i i was i really want to shave because i'm just looking at his mustache  thinking i can't do that anymore why can't you do the mustache i gotta i can't i'm because i'm  looking at at charles bronson and just going it just doesn't i can't do it yeah but is there a 
[00:37:30]  picture of charles bronson without a mustache i don't know that might look really fucking strange  which means you might look strange without the mustache i know and if you remember oh my god is  that him without a mustache yeah you want to keep your mustache you want to keep your mustache there  is a picture from the um hard rock when i went to the hard rock and we met cousin brucey and took a  picture with him and we met michael moore for the first time yes and i was clean shaven that night  was that the beatles thing yeah yeah yeah the big beatles tribute we've never been anything

[00:42:00]  above the water line nothing better than a dump that goes above the water yeah above the water line  that's tough to do it is it happens though from time to time i don't like the splashback when you know  that there's just a world of hurt going on in the water that's one of those just go don't even pull  your pants up no right to the shower yeah right to the hit the showers yes dan what i find to be the 
[00:42:30]  worst is when you have solid in front and then there's air behind so it just shoots into the  bowl like a fucking potato launcher yeah because then you have to like you have to start wiping the  back of your thighs yeah that's when you just go just get in the shower shower time you gotta hit  the showers hit the showers people you ever dump in the shower never i haven't how do you do that i  haven't either gotta fucking step on it in the drain like a play-doh fun factory what the fuck is that

[00:46:30]  time like it would be a great show to watch you know what it is it's a fucking carny act it's carny acts  it's the fucking guy with the nail through his nose he's a superhero who could drive a nail into  his own sinuses and like last night they had b guy and it's like this man is a superhero because he  can control bees he's invented his own formula of pheromones and what he did is something that's 
[00:47:00]  been done a thousand times he puts this shit on him that like comes out of a queen bee and then the  whole swarm covers his body right now who hasn't seen this shit right that's not a superhero it's  a fucking carny act and the guy that fucking slices the uh sure bullet in half with the samurai sword  yeah it's impressive but it's something you know hurry hurry hurry everybody step right inside for a  nickel you can see it sure and all right whatever but it's not superheroes these are super fucking 
[00:47:30]  carny act the samurai thing that's not a real one though right uh yeah the guy actually was firing  some kind of weapon what show was this on it was on superheroes oh it was yes he fired a gun and  the man had a samurai sword and he sliced the bullet in half  can't stand that guy that fucking rules traveling the world looking for super humans and the bee people  do they get stung no this guy didn't get stung he they have to get stung a couple times come on well 
[00:48:00]  this guy got all those bees on you none of them are like he took a one bee and actually stung himself  in the finger just to have uh the guy daniel the host daniel right uh to smell it after it's stung  right he smelled it and goes it smells like bananas yeah uh and and it seems that when you when when  that that that this guy likes bananas oh he loves the fucking bananas does he like bananas i love bananas

[00:56:00]  10 wins and then 88 was doing some and uh everyone they went to  reminded me of chip chipperson because they they were trying to be kind of funny  with what happened one guy was like yeah it was raining and he even sounded like chip a little he goes it was raining you know one minute  it was like getting dark and then before you knew it was like uh someone turned on a fire hose or something  and i'm like oh my god they're throwing chip chipperson lines out 
[00:56:30]  they don't even know they don't know but they sound just like chip right they're trying to sound like  seinfeld yeah yeah yeah no they sound like chip chip they sound like chip  something and one one old lady was she actually did talk about her  garbage pails  she goes and i was watching and my garbage pails flew over the fence into the river  into the river i say good morning to the river every morning 
[00:57:00]  it's a spot but at least there wasn't like a four-day build-up but like this big storm yeah yeah true they  didn't do any of that because they didn't really know it was coming which opie i was following you on  twitter with the whole hurricane down in north carolina and you were out of your mind it was so funny  like these fucking people are panicking there's nothing and then they just yeah they made him  evacuate i'm the guy on the beach i'm definitely the guy that would stay through a storm and then  probably would lose my life but right but i i'm that guy i want to stay and check it out  but we were in a house with 20 people and we were divided and i lost in the end civil war and they 
[00:57:30]  finally said mandatory evacuation so now you don't have a choice now you have to go and i'm thinking  i've talked to a few locals that's what's great about twitter you talk to the locals  they told me just put the car behind the house you'll be fine right they come they come looking  to see who stayed yeah i know they'll not they're not gonna they'll knock on the door you don't answer  your door and they're not gonna go around back to make sure you're actually gone to see where your  car is with a landlord when he used to come on like oh fuck mandatory rent what the fuck is that 
[00:58:00]  i'm uh i don't know i'm like george carl and george when these things hit slow down well no yeah i don't  mean it like that i know sorry but i mean as far as how he looks at shit that's what i meant uh when  i see these storm things i want to see fucking devastation i think everybody does you think  everyone does because i wonder about that yeah then why doesn't anyone else talk about it but that's why  the news pumps it up like they do you don't want to it's you don't want the devastation to happen to 
[00:58:30]  you or anyone you know obviously yeah but if you don't know the people who gives a fuck you want  to see some horrific uh fucking video whenever they say something like thank god the hurricane  took that last minute turn because uh could have done some real damage to the area uh back to you  in the studio it's like no they're like they wanted it they wanted a direct hit no they want to send all  their reporters out to fucking trees down and wires fucking jumping electricity and shit and  people know what i say at that point what the fuck am i gonna watch this weekend now yeah 
[00:59:00]  because is there anything better than watching a disaster unfold on tv right in front of your eyes  people really do love disasters i know i don't know why even when they like cnn they keep showing that  same footage over and over again you still keep watching it yeah you watch it look at that fucking  remember the earthquake in la and they had one angle it was it was kind of bad with this going back  fucking 15 years ago i think but uh they had one angle down one road where there was a fire 
[00:59:30]  um a broken water main and some downed wires and a busted up house yeah and it looked like  fucking armageddon right and then if they turn the camera a little bit there's no damage nothing  they picked they picked a fucking perfect angle to make it look like la was fucking falling off into  the pacific when i was watching the hurricane katrina because that's the five-year anniversary just  passed oh as soon as they said ah we got the we got the levy the levee's under control i'm like 
[01:00:00]  all right what's what else is on tv click i was bummed no i'll be honest i was bummed next disaster  have fun with the cleanup i'm gonna go watch always sunny and how many how many times did you watch  the tsunami videos where people are on the beach and you just see like the water yeah pull out and  then fucking comes back in and all the videos of people in restaurants and and the tables start  floating it's like oh this is fucking great i'm just gonna watch this every hour there was brand  new footage you're like oh someone else is coming oh i'm watching this this is great but those people 
[01:00:30]  are stupid because you see the ocean sucking its itself out to sea yeah and these idiots like oh  let's go see if there's some cool shells we could pick up i think everyone knows now but no one knew  back then that that was a tsunami coming they just thought oh look at low tides coming in three seconds  goes back to the apes i was talking about earlier yeah you're on a beach and you see the ocean  sucking itself back out yeah and you're thinking that that's normal and uh and you're not getting  low tide i'm not like that's a little weird i never saw that before no yeah but but oh cool let 
[01:01:00]  me walk out there and get some shells low tide takes five or six hours to happen when you see this  happen within a 10 15 minute period but did you not thinking but did you know that before this can't be  good before this should happen did you know that the ocean pulled back before a tidal wave honestly  i did not i had no clue but something in my brain would go this i don't think is good you think  you should get the fuck out would you you wouldn't want to leave the fucking no no you'd have been  standing on the beach going why is the water going let me try to explain you're right though you are 
[01:01:30]  right i would have been on the beach too you caught me uh being a hypocrite but but i would try to get  to high ground or in an area go all right well the ocean just sucked out i gotta see what fucking  happens now i'm not i'm not in my uh beach chair anymore i probably would have walked down to the  beach and been one of those people that got washed away because you'd be like oh wow what's happening  down there but let me see because because that's usually covered up with ocean and now i get to see  what's under the ocean let me walk out there so you so you're thinking oh the shoreline just decided 
[01:02:00]  to readjust itself instantly i'm like i'm in it i'm on the other side of the world maybe that's how  the oceans work over here i haven't heard of samami since seventh grade so i don't even know  how they work whatever this video all of these videos are unbelievable why would you turn the  camera you idiot shit when that water just started going into the pool at that resort yeah it was like  the sickest shit it just comes in and people like yeah we're on the fifth floor we should be okay 
[01:02:30]  and you just see the water coming up to the fourth floor sure you got models hanging from trees yeah yeah  like model girls hanging from a tree a boyfriend washed away but because her i talk about this too  and no one wants to discuss this shit because her boyfriend washed washed away she became a huge star  big star yeah she kind of did for a while yeah i don't know what she's doing now fucking star she  was fucked up this erne andrews that's that's the big one i like talking about because technically it 
[01:03:00]  doesn't really hurt anybody because that guy was peeping her and got you know naked pictures on the  internet she became a huge star she milked that thing too and she was on dance with the stars she  wasn't going to be on there if some creep wasn't uh looking at her through a peephole with some milked  my video pictures oh i know did you say i got the video of that i'm very hot did you milk it of course  that was a good one there's something about voyeurism absolutely always fantastic even when i go to the  porn sites and it says you know hidden camera girl masturbating i know that they set it up yeah yeah 
[01:03:30]  for some reason i believe it and it works for me yeah yeah it's and the chick doesn't even have to  be as hot as another girl would have to be in another video like she could be very average but  if if you're just peeping in something and you know you know it's fake because she positions  herself perfect where the camera is moves her legs right right gets the dildo out and starts  masturbating it's not even from a side view where it's totally believable like damn that guy can't get  a good view because he's peeping i'm i'm with you as long as they don't look at the camera though 
[01:04:00]  because they always fuck up and yeah give a look to the camera like no man make believe you don't  know don't break that fourth wall yeah you're not in moonlighting stop it you don't know this is  happening don't wink i just went with a moonlight moonlighting ouch uh bonnie in dc what's up hey guys  i just wanted to say that if the water started to fuck back opie you would probably just think it  was a cool new place to shit you'd go out there and take a dump you know what though i finally 
[01:04:30]  found someone that's going to agree with me who and his name is jim florentine you think so you  absolutely you could throw this out to anybody and kelly almost almost was with me that animal  no he said he fucking shit during hunting and people or or camping and that's normal you find a  tree you dig a big hole at the base of the tree you lean on it you take a dump you brought toilet  people with you it's as civilized as you can be and then you bury it take a hole you're in nature  already nah because you got to cover that shit up florentine have you ever shit outside of course 
[01:05:00]  i knew it we used to have to do this we worked on this uh this house it was all fucked up right for  like nine months and there was this big tree stump like 50 feet away with a big hole and it was like  a perfect toilet i would just go to every morning i wouldn't even shit at home i would sit on that  stuff and shit with the new with the new york post and the and 50 feet from all the other  construction workers see now all right danny get me that link email me that fucking link is fantastic  i'm sorry what is danny danny caught masturbating danny got caught masturbating yes and i want to 
[01:05:30]  see it on video no there's uh if you're gonna masturbate it's probably best to do it away from  the window and there's just some it's an open window and some girl is just rubbing one out  come on she's gotta know dude that looks pretty good because it's from far away yeah gotta know  she's got a small room she's gotta know look it's fine she's probably going with it that's her thing 
[01:06:00]  i've talked about the uh she's gotta know the asian girl that lives behind me right she leaves her  fucking window shades up all the time and goes to bed takes her fucking clothes off  and walks in front of the window naked and she's like college age and uh what was it the other day  we were in the yard and now my yard's kind of lit up a little tiki torches and some lighting and  everything like that everything off well we did that once it's like it was like it was like world war 
[01:06:30]  two when an air raid siren went off shut everything down yes i can't come on light discipline people  light discipline get that cigarette out you motherfucker uh yeah so well we didn't turn the  lights out she turned the light on and we knew it's dark enough where she can't see out the window  even with a little bit of subdued lighting in my yard so i'm like lights on so me and danny like  stand up and look out like looking at in in the window and we see her walk by it's like oh 
[01:07:00]  oh there she is there and then the lights shut out and we're like oh lights out and then we we sit  back down because now she could probably see us i'm like and then the light came back on like  lights on we stand up and then instantly went back out again and we're thinking she's fucking with us  now she's fucking with us and watching us stand up and sit down is she hot uh yeah yeah she's she's  got a pretty good body on her i saw her once uh best shot i ever saw of her was she was looking at 
[01:07:30]  her computer on the bed and her bed is right under the open window so she would she had like her back  arched and her ass up she was on her knees and she's on her elbows looking at her computer so you  had a good arch back ass up shot and i was just watching that for a while and and i saw you have clothes  on no totally totally naked so i actually went into my fucking office and spun my security camera  around and zoomed right in on it were you able to yeah he's got great oh i was sitting there just 
[01:08:00]  fucking looking at my security camera screen uh and just a great shot of it and then one day she  was also there and danny grabs the fucking binoculars and i only got one set of binoculars  so i had to grab my fucking 50 cal with the scope on it and i flipped the scope up and just fucking  was sitting there looking at her through my fucking barrett 50 cal scope what's wrong with you  it's like i thought there was a sniper something really sexy about looking at a girl through crosshairs 
[01:08:30]  i'm like looking at her going this is so hot and i could shoot her fucking nipple off if i wanted  neighbors looking at you so now they're seeing you looking through a fucking scope they weren't  looking at me i shut the the kitchen lights out yeah and had the uh the uh rifle on my um island in  the middle of the uh kitchen and i was looking out my window which was totally blacked out and her  light was on so i got a perfect view uh through the scope right really nice fucking leap hold scope so 
[01:09:00]  nice nice high power quality it was great i had a friend of mine who had a girl across the way same  thing uh would always get naked but he was outdoor in a day working so he'd set his video camera up  and just put it on record and put it in his window and then when he got home he just scanned through  the whole thing there's six hours it's like fishing to find a day hoping he got one that day yeah he's  like about three and a half hours in i think that's even better that is a good one for the video like  come on come on do we get lucky today it's like watching uh deadliest catch when they get the 
[01:09:30]  first crab pots all right when they pull it up come on come on what do we got did we hit pay dirt  here guys how great would it be if grandma's visiting and using that room that day though  gotta throw that one back yeah yeah that's not a keeper my brother i've told the story a few times  but i'm telling it for florentine my brother brett owns uh fh riley's terrific place out there in  huntington fucking he had a situation where his neighbor same thing as what aunt's going through but 
[01:10:00]  these houses in huntington he'd lived in the village real close yeah so she would turn her  lights on every morning she was an early riser five five thirty i'm not really sure exactly riser but  really early my brother's in the restaurant business he would set his alarm it got so good she would get  up every fucking morning would be completely naked from the window the whole deal he would he got to  the point he not only set his alarm he would he would put snacks on the windowsill for the show  and he would the alarm would go off he knows that she's ready to you know i think it was the 
[01:10:30]  bathroom or whatever ready to go in the shower and he would just kind of peek his eyes up because  i mean the windows only try to remember maybe 40 feet away right and then he would just nibble on  some snacks and then watch her get ready for work snacks yeah he thought she was uh he thought she  was on to him though because she would give kind of looks as she was going to her car in the morning  oh really when he would happen to be outside the same time whatever yeah and she would give a look  like yeah you know we got a little agreement here it's all good i gotta wait till a little bit 
[01:11:00]  winter so these things look at look at this view right here here's the window you need some leaves  to fall yeah yeah that's the window see she leaves it she's shut it a little bit it's usually up there  but her bed is right here there's a lot of reflection in the daytime but at night and look how far away  this is dude watch this it's like i'm just showing florentine how this is like how sick is that that's  like a half mile away i would break into apartment just to put the blinds up higher send somebody in

[01:30:30]  we had new neighbors move in and she wasn't she wasn't hot i'm not gonna make it like it was the  other stories but she was probably like a seven and uh they were painting the apartment they moved  their bed in front of the window and i'm walking through my kitchen and i look out the window all of  of a sudden i see them fucking railing he's railing his girl against the window i mean she's holding  on to the fucking window frame and i'm like oh i always had to i had to stop and go to the door and  just hang out there for a little while a wife's like oh what are you doing oh nothing 
[01:31:00]  fuck that was it those are the two stories better than the mastectomy anyway  yeah  as he's hanging up what did he say yeah fuck you yeah fuck you  poor guy all right there's a good one take it so personally you cunt this is a good one tom go ahead 
[01:31:30]  hey how you doing boys all right brother uh i was at uh ruckers not too long ago actually and uh one of my  buddies we're at the the hockey house one of my buddies it's one of those 20 guys three girls  thing gets his uh religious girlfriend he's been trying to fuck for years gets her down in his room  and we all pile up on the porch he's got the room around the porch we're drinking beer and we actually  did get there he's fucking her we're watching it's a good time one of my buddies gets the bright idea to uh  through the open window take the broom that was on the porch and start poking him in the ass as he's 
[01:32:00]  fucking her out of the bed the big irishman gets so pissed off he comes chasing out we actually  somebody snapped a picture of him half it's still fucking hard on half through the window coming  out to beat the shit out of us that's pretty good  that is pretty good thank you sir good story brother  space trucker what does he have for him watch him have sex with an asian girl  everyone's got fucked a girl in a park i was hiding in the bushes watching and got stung by a 
[01:32:30]  bunch of bees what tom and madison tom bees how you doing all right yeah me and a girlfriend you  know it was one of those things where we couldn't go anywhere we wanted to go so we picked a nice  great big park we found a nice secluded area and threw a blanket down and and let things start to  happen we were just in the middle of it she's on top just we're we're having a good time and all of  us then we start hearing son of a bitch right right right right and the guy comes swailing out of 
[01:33:00]  the bushes with his arms bitching about bees and it was just unbelievable the girl immediately starts  reaching for the clothes that are within her reach to cover up her tits stop because she was on top  of me i throw her off but the guy was the guy actually started ragging on us for yeah you shouldn't  be doing that out here in the park but well meanwhile he had been in the bushes yeah probably jacking  it yeah checking out the whole thing jacking that's his load probably attracted the bees  jesus it was never never creepy enough to sit there and jerk off it was just kind of cool to see 
[01:33:30]  yeah you know it's like if you're sitting there standing there jerking off peeking in on something  that's probably where you're crossing the line yeah yeah that's crossing you would use that vision  later on yeah later on you might be able to you know conjure it up and and use it to  all right but if you see that one that lives across from you for like a half hour just masturbating  on the bed you won't just a half hour straight you won't try trying to think you probably right  across that no i'd rather just concentrate on looking at it try to figure out a better view or something 
[01:34:00]  yeah it's it's something weird there's not it's not like i'd rather just put porno up on the  fucking screen and that's a little more a little easier but there's just something cool about watching it  it not so much about jacking it and watching it like i i was i was watching her on the bench it  wasn't getting a hard on or anything but it was just cool to watch yeah it was something just fun  opie what was that um you plugged some uh website like camera phones where chicks take pictures of 
[01:34:30]  their camera i used to go to but i forgot what it was it's a great site where chicks these crazy  chicks just take pictures taking pictures in the mirror on the mirror themselves camera mirror or  something yeah horrible news that's that went down update on that that site went down really  yeah because they're not sure how old uh the girls are in this and i love that site what was it called  camera camera mirror anthony actually turned us on to it first then i tweeted it but yeah i think  that thing went away i think it was girl girl camera mirror something like that let me see because 
[01:35:00]  it was a great site a lot of the guys in philly love that site and they over vacation like bad news  man that site went away i'm like what then i'm thinking yeah it's got to be because they're not  sure how old some of these girls are yeah so wasn't that what makes it good unless you're running that  fucking uh website yeah there's the other guy running it right and then there could be a problem  it's good for everybody except that guy i was trying to sleep at night wondering when they're  gonna knock on his door that uh it's like when you download a clip of like you know you watch a clip 
[01:35:30]  of like on you porn on one of those sites and they say like college girl whatever and she's getting  fucked and you're thinking in the back of my man if i ever have to get my computer fixed or the  cops have a look at this like i didn't know what you said college girl so she's got to be over 70  could i get in trouble for looking yeah yeah that's always in the back of your mind what's wrong with  you guys who gets their computer fixed no you don't no i don't either but i'm just saying no  glitter does and you see what happens there pete townsend does you get your shoes fixed no you go out 
[01:36:00]  and get new shoes new shoes and that computer breaks down oh time for a new computer i don't have  horrid porno in my shoes that's what i'm saying i know my apple like you throw away an old pair  of shoes super drive and hard drive my apple and i got it fixed one time i gave them their computer  so and then i was a little i'm like i was nervous i'm like what about those that college girl thing  that i looked at one time i'm like is this gonna come back and i was something i dropped off in  seattle because i was on the road they were gonna mail it back and i'm on a fucking plane back home like 
[01:36:30]  what the fuck did i just do right when uh when i throw a computer out it uh the thing looks like  it's been exploded the way i take it apart take it down hard drives got to come out yeah the best  thing is just to take the hard drive down the down to the range and just blast it with a 50 cal it's  amazing when someone commits a crime and they know they're eventually going to get caught and they  still have their computer there and the cops come like two weeks later yeah it's like why wouldn't  you just could completely destroy that computer you can get one at best buy for three hundred dollars 
[01:37:00]  and you keep the same with all the evidence on there to fucking threatening emails the whole plot  pull at least pull the hard drive they never do that i i tweeted uh the other day i was watching um  i love that show i almost got away with it right and it's uh these guys and they they talk about how  they got caught they were fugitives for a while and then they get caught and one of these guys  get caught because he tied some bitch up with duct tape and or guy and killed him and then took the 
[01:37:30]  duct tape home and put it in his drawer it's like 395 at home depot you dumb fuck and and they matched  up where it had ripped right and where the tear was on the oh no kidding it's like he didn't even  tear off another little piece right so it wouldn't match he kept the duct tape and yeah the hard drive  thing it's like if you know they're kind of on to you wouldn't you just pull your fucking hard drive  and and throw it in the river or something i i throw my computers in the hudson river is that what 
[01:38:00]  you do in the river the entire computer speakers and all fuck it like who knows what those speakers  could fucking uncover like if someone's hammered one night or whatever it is and you go to a kiddie  porn site and you're looking at pictures the next day you should get rid of your computer  just get rid of your fucking dump it take your hard drive out fucking drill holes through the hard  drive and then just explode it take it to the range yeah take it to the fucking firing range should we 
[01:38:30]  take a break sure oh full of shit you get broken computer to broke brother now they have a shitty  computer it was just a dumb joke you stupid fucking ape i gave uh one of my computers to my sister and  patrick and uh but beforehand i completely wiped it and yeah like the whole hard drive was wiped complete 
[01:39:00]  and uh re reinstalled windows like here's a new unused computer kind of a thing but there are there are  forensics guys computer forensics that could probably still pull shit oh i'm sure off of that but i'm  sure i don't have anything bad on there that's why it doesn't bother me it's i've never gone to  a site that has anything illegal on it and you know they they look for people that are using their credit  cards and fucking trading shit and back in the old early aol days it was all about trading so you had to 
[01:39:30]  deal with other people like like oh okay trade in gif's question mark bing yeah this is what you'd  do you'd be like or you'd put one picture up you're like all right let me if you even had a picture i  got well i've never go to those rooms and have nothing to trade you're like fuck they're on it  it was early on and in fucking internet porn so yeah even getting one picture if someone was stupid  enough to send their picture then you stole that and said all right well i got a picture i'm  reset in the same fucking room it was just more and and you finally got one you get one picture 
[01:40:00]  you'd send it out to the room and then you'd wait you'd sit back and just hear you've got mail  you've got mail you've got mail you've got mail and you're like oh you get all excited and you  fucking start like downloading it and people were cool to download real slow but people were cool back  then because if you sent a really good one then that fucking thing would be  because they were hoping if they gave you something you were going to like continue 
[01:40:30]  yeah yeah yeah with your good stuff your good stuff yeah they thought you were like the hell  of the guy in the room right it's oh man you gotta if this guy comes in the room he's got some great  shit right i love waiting for it to download the little pieces come in like oh there's the tit  so far so good top of the head  yeah 
[01:41:00]  yeah we'd start off with just like one  that's what you said like that's when you would  fuck with the room like send some horrific picture 
[01:41:30]  because in the end you're always just trying to make the joke  so you would just go all right let's see what we can do with this room all right  let's some horrific some asshole sent me this picture  no this is uh you know you've got mail you gotta bait that  you've got mail you've got mail you've got mail  right all right let me send this fucking thing out  goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye

[01:54:00]  that's pretty cool that is an odd thing that jim norton can replace terry bradshaw for something  right like i don't understand what that could be they're not quite similar right and then  then we we all know our pal norton he was out of his mind yesterday yeah i heard there was a big  crisis pretty much yelling and screaming at god because god decided to throw a storm our way  when he needed to get to an airport i know because we have the same agent and manager and i had some 
[01:54:30]  shit going on yesterday i need to talk to her about the look look there's a jim norton situation  yeah i gotta call you back in three hours and both of them said that i'm like what's going on is he  okay like he's trying to get to the airport i'm like he if i can't talk to you about this thing in my  career like no we have a situation yeah jimmy was losing his mind he if his flight wasn't delayed  he would have missed his flight right exactly he was that late i laughed because i thought you said  to your agents i got a jim norton situation to make them drop everything no they did that's what  you should do yeah i should go on i got a norton situation now you know we're having bill ward on 
[01:55:00]  that metal show we're taping in like two weeks out in la very cool the gym has this big black sabbath  picture the only autograph he doesn't have on there is bill ward oh you're so involved  this whole thing is that it's out of control that's all it means now that's all it's about  now so it's him getting that he's been trying to get this picture he's been trying to get this picture  out to la so we could uh get it signed for him and uh he had uh kenny checking out flights to make 
[01:55:30]  sure there's like a um a closet where they could put the picture in because he can't put in the overhead  apartment it's a whole thing so he's calling the airlines to make sure like a 777 has the closet  but the 70 67 doesn't he needs a special plane yes picture he's out of his mind here comes kenny  uh wow he he's he's out of his mind with this stuff right well first of all take us back to  yesterday because this was all last minute shit with leno and and kenny had to take the brunt of  it now my home office was the command center for seven hours yesterday seven hours kenny told me 
[01:56:00]  i had two three phone lines my two home phone lines and my cell phone going between jim his manager  his agent the tonight show the car service the hotel and while i'm talking the internet when i'm  checking every airline every airport every flight tracking the weather 
[01:56:30]  this by the way i gotta tell people is not a joke yeah this is what kenny has to deal with  when there's a jim norton situation yeah and getting text messages every five minutes from jim  all right who took two hours and 15 minutes to get from his apartment in manhattan  to john f kennedy airport which should take a half hour yeah yeah all right but he just left  in rush hour traffic during that tornado 
[01:57:00]  right and thank god his flight was 25 minutes late or he wouldn't have made it yeah he'd have  missed his flight yeah and you would have to hear it right yeah i'm cool i'm calling the port  authority police to try to get him an escort to the to the airport he knows how to get escorts  through tsa security oh my god right and then he's got this picture that i'm surprised he didn't  have an armed guard or me accompany with him because he basically has his manager has to like get an 
[01:57:30]  armored car stuffed with pillows to transport this picture yeah it's got to be on pillows and yeah and  because my manager is not going to be in town or something tomorrow so he wants he's freaking out like  who's going to pick the picture up and how are they going to transport it to your office where's  the picture now well jimmy brought the picture with him so he has he made sure that there was a closet  is there was there a closet on this flight well he he's cursing me because the dumb people that 
[01:58:00]  answer the phone don't know the closet dimensions on the plane people he's punching up yeah i i can't  he punch up the specs on a seven seven seven i need to know the dimensions of uh the closet florence  you're so involved he's not going to ask you how the taping went none of that it's going to all be  about did you get inside uh ladies and gentlemen once you do a buckle your seat belt we're going to  have a little turbulence uh now no no bumps i got a picture in the closet

[01:59:00]  award the bill ward to complete the the autographs i'm amazed he took it out of his  apartment something happens to this fucking thing because it's got to travel six thousand miles yeah  oh my god but if anything happened to that he's freaking out because my manager can't meet him at  the airport or something so he doesn't he's like who's going to pick this picture up how is it going  to get transported to your office 20 minutes away from lax who's taking this like what do you think  they could put on the back of a flatbed and not tie it down and you make one turn and it's going to 
[01:59:30]  fucking roll over on the 405 oh shit so who's taking it to your i don't know he was trying to  work that out he was in such a crisis last night why wouldn't he take it there no they hired somebody  i don't know because they hired somebody to take his picture because last time um his his manager  he's he's fucking crazy yeah well you know him jonathan you know he's nuts you know he travels the  world no jimmy's fucking crazy everyone does but he he for jimmy's birthday one day he got him like

[02:00:30]  connected to jonathan he won't call he won't call his personal yeah secretary because he will not  talk to her oh wow what you don't be the greatest thing if we get on set at that metal show and bill  ward's like nah i don't want to sign it oh man i just i'm not in this i don't know if you're going  to put this on ebay because you got all of it how now imagine that no i don't i'm not i don't sign  with those guys is it like some problem yeah do you got the special pen too well i don't right you  need the special pen you better talk to norton it's got to be a virgin sharpie right kenny knows it's 
[02:01:00]  got to be virgin yeah you can never have been used on something or just sign it with a horrible  a ballpoint that's just some horrible that you can't see his signature at all and you have to  test the sharpie to make sure it's an even ink flow really so it's not to make a blotch yeah are you  kidding beforehand erock's got a life or death assignment today oh shit what's he doing going  on well philip seymour hoffman is coming uh to serious today 11 o'clock to do interviews okay 
[02:01:30]  he's a very fine actor i gotta hear it right from erock and then kenny obviously you'll fill  in the blanks but uh erock just ran down the hall which is kind of strange running  this is nuts what what with this philip seymour hoffman thing yeah a lot of people have been  working on this don't and well jimmy gets everybody involved and expects everyone to drop their  duties everything you know what's amazing about this whole thing that's going on the bill  ward and philip seymour hoffman the guy's doing a bit on the tonight show 
[02:02:00]  tonight right and he's worried about this other shit like you think you'd be in your hotel and  totally focus and this is a big night for him he will focus on this other stuff way before  focus obsess obsess he'll obsess on this he's got five million people watching him tonight yeah yeah  but that doesn't mean a thing he's going to be all over erock and everyone else making sure that's  done here's my picture people comedians die to get on the tonight show it's the biggest break in show  business you're forgetting this too he only likes to go out there so he could eat sushi at his 
[02:02:30]  favorite sushi place and get the miles on continental  and meet other people that are on leno and get their autographs and pictures can we just uh go  back to what was just said because this is the god's honest truth because some people get confused  you guys making jokes no he he books trips to la just to go to a sushi joint that i have been to  twice and it is amazing it's in a dumb strip mall it's a shitty place oh that place but yeah i know  which one sushi uh with the hunchback guy huh yeah yeah yeah if you're in the la area that's the 
[02:03:00]  only place to get sushi but he will book trips specifically just because he obsessed about the  sushi at this joint yeah yeah that's the tonight show is secondary yeah that's just you know the  reason so ira go out there why is your assignment nuts well this has been going in the planning stages  for a while because there's a uh an a-list celebrity who's going to be here today oh we  already said who was okay so philip seymour hoffman's gonna be here now going through publicists and um  talent bookers and all this other stuff it was said that he wasn't taking any photos not signing any 
[02:03:30]  autographs but somehow it got through that jim norton would be the only one he's always the only one  only one who would be allowed to get a photo so this was the big deal jimmy tells me yesterday he's  leaving for los angeles he's got to do the tonight show so kenny will have something for me to get  signed now originally he was not going to sign anything right they just made the exception for  the photo so now the photo exception has to be changed to an autograph exception what do you think 
[02:04:00]  uh it would be like more of a hassle for philip seymour hoffman uh the signing or the photo i would  think signing would be easier so i think it's easier right yeah because he's probably looks like  shit he didn't feel he's doing radio so he feels like he doesn't have signatures oh by the way i  just saw him right there he is on the tv same guy right there uh there you go he's a philip seymour  he's directing this what movie is he in i don't know this is the movie though that he'll be promoting 
[02:04:30]  today it's not on our show obviously not on our show what show is he doing by the way uh i'm not 100  sure i gotta go check the should we just start ripping him apart to ruin this whole thing for  jimmy zach goes boating zach goes boating is the name of the movie well that movie looks like  jimmy would hate me so now you got to get an autograph so now it got to prove that now the  autograph is acceptable it's a go so i have to make sure that i'm there waiting the second he's done 
[02:05:00]  to get it signed right before he leaves if you fuck this up what's getting signed by the way um  his copy of boogie nights that has several other signatures on it oh wow do you have a special pen  did he talk about the marker yes with all the turmoil going on yesterday right he's like don't  forget to stop at my apartment and pick up the dvd oh my god so i go to the doorman it's in a padded  manila manila envelope that says fragile on it 
[02:05:30]  handwritten fragile by jimmy  he's so funny man  the dvd is never fragile never fragile  i've never gotten a dvd in the mail and it broke  are we allowed to look at the boogie nights dvd right now um i can't allow it  i really want to see who signed it who has signed it already um i didn't look at i i think heather 
[02:06:00]  graham signed the gram um she was here i didn't look at the other signatures because i was really  trying not to touch it mark walberg was mark walberg i don't think no i've never had him on  we've had him on the phone riley guy john c riley i said oh yeah he might yeah riley's great right  so there's two things going on there's a few there's a few signatures i picked up the um the  black ones in the back but i grabbed the silver one just to bring in here silver these are the  special kind of pens yeah it's like it's like a spray paint can yeah you got to shake it and it's 
[02:06:30]  a silver thing and those are very dangerous you could get a great signature or you could ruin the  fucking thing if you press too hard the shit just pours out onto whatever you're trying to sign  as jimmy has instructed me over the years when you get these new ones because i've done this many  times with him so you get the new pen and usually he likes to do it because he doesn't trust me doing  this but i'll hand him the new pen and he'll sit there and he'll go like this dab oh oh really does 
[02:07:00]  a quick fast scribble no this goes on for almost 30 seconds like he's just sitting there scribbling  this just to make sure that each side because if you get it pointed at one side here it could dry out  and then all the ink is also he's shaping the uh the point so that if it's a brand new marker  you go to sign it won't smudge yeah it won't smudge or it sometimes it won't the ink won't  come out if you go too right right so you'll miss half the signature so that's an evenly distributed  amount of uh on both sides or whatever that is and then it's closed back up and not to be used 
[02:07:30]  until please sign his dvd and if you're sitting there please sign it for as philip seymour hoffman  please do this for us i don't know it'll be one for the we've been friends for so long i don't  know if i can do that to him you guys have been friends forever he would not talk to you like he  doesn't talk to the secretary absolutely it would be over they would it would be that  motherfucker he would tell the manager agent get rid of him if he's not you you're a kind florenton 
[02:08:00]  you would just be that that guy yeah oh man wow there's two situations up there was one time i  forgot who the celebrity was but uh jimmy and i went down there with his photo to get another  photo and get the photo that he had signed uh the person was coming over but then a publicist  or somebody went to talk to that person interference and so we had to wait a couple seconds more but  jim turned to me he's like put the cover back on that marker it's drying out so i'm sitting here  with the photo like this and not only here's the photos professionally done by this photo lab really you 
[02:08:30]  you know high tech stuff and it's sort of on a cardboard uh mount so that you don't have a  newspaper or magazine flat yeah it's perfectly on a piece of cardboard so when it's signed it could  be signed evenly perfectly no little bumps on it or anything so i i would be standing there holding  this while jim goes to shake his head uh whoever the person's hand is and uh say hello and what have  you so i'd be sitting there holding the photo and the marker with the cap if the person's coming over 
[02:09:00]  and then gets uh derailed for a moment put it back on put it back on three two one mark  not only that when you're the cameraman for his photo we've all we've all had that pressure you you  you you you can't you got to look inconspicuous i don't know how you look inconspicuous i'll tell  you to do that yeah you're stalking somebody waiting to take their picture you can't turn the camera on  too soon because even though if he has a hundred percent battery you can't waste it you know and 
[02:09:30]  you gotta do dry runs you gotta we've all done the dry runs we've got a metallica backstage i remember  like all right headfield's in that room so jim you stand by the door like you're coming out let me take  a picture to make sure the lighting's good so i would be walking out the door and coming that way  and we're looking at it like it's not to be the headfield like stand-in yeah so it's like all right  we gotta get headfield over here because the lighting's better so not when we won't get him  right when he comes out of the door yeah yeah yeah wait till he takes your five steps you remember 
[02:10:00]  when we're at giant stadium backstage two hours after the show getting uh getting all the guys  pictures were you at that one no i was at the newark one uh the prudential arena with him was  the prudential arena i thought you were there because it was the last time i ever hung around  with uh norton backstage because i couldn't take it anymore but by the time we got to our car  there was there was no cars in the lot that's how long we had to wait he'll he'll wait until the  sun's coming i know an hour and 45 minutes for ace freely he ran out the other door 
[02:10:30]  we were sitting you weren't there i know i was at nassau coliseum for metallica god smack but i  thought you were there for the last time i i went through this so how mad was he mad at ace freely  that he left we were sitting it was the house of blues in new orleans you know and uh you know  they treat us to dinner you know they have that uh and vip tickets and it was a great show and  everything and then they bring us backstage and we're sitting in the green room we're the only 
[02:11:00]  three people me norton and marina franklin and uh you know time's passing where is he what's going  on jim's like oh he's taking a shower like he's always got an excuse to justify how long the time is  taking right until you hit like the hour mark now he's starting to second guess like what a loser he  is and you know he's waiting and he's never gonna come and i got you know now i gotta try to get him  positive and give him some hope and everything you know and then all of a sudden they're turning the  lights out and they're security guards like kicking us out they're like he left an hour ago oh how 
[02:11:30]  how was that night after that how is that the entire night's fucked to talk him off a ledge he  probably went back to his room and emptied the minibar you know how many times did he say  fuck ace freely yeah yeah also he hates the person i wanted to eat through him out of band right right  right we went through uh this recently with carol burnett over at the jazz at lincoln center all right  right carol burnett okay so jim was so excited that she was uh she was doing another xm program that 
[02:12:00]  were there so we get there really early and in that same area they're also setting up for um uh  it's that thing where the networks display what's coming up in the fall so discovery channel was there  and a couple other things so we're walking by and right in the area where we're supposed to meet  carol burnett they're setting up oprah winfrey's dressing room mike tyson's dressing room all these  other people and he's like oh my god oh my god we have to get this fast they're gonna kick us out  of here oprah's right there like he's freaking out about who's these rooms next to us so we're 
[02:12:30]  waiting for carol and carol is a little bit late not a lot i'd say maybe five ten minutes past the  time she was supposed to be there but we had gotten there so early that jim was freaking out that she  wasn't going to show up they were going to kick us out because they're setting up this tv like he's  pacing back and forth driving everyone nuts and he's trying to rationalize in his head where she is  what's going on what's the delay finally shows up and here's the other problem with taking photos  with jim i'm glad he got this new camera that he's been playing with yeah his old one the silver one 
[02:13:00]  the flash takes a little bit longer oh that's the worst so you you sit there and you hold it but you  have to wait for the flash to go off when it finally does you have your photo but that's nothing you can  do anything about yeah and if you've probably seen it in the studio a few times he would sit there  come on come on like it's not going to pass come on come on come on and he also goes i think i was  blinking can we get another one so he does the two shot and he did it with carol burnett both photos  came out fine and then he got annoyed because somebody else asked him to take a photo didn't 
[02:13:30]  know who jim was but it was working for the company said hey could you take a photo and jim was just  staring at the guy like dead eye no expression on his face and then hands the camera off to me and  walked out of the room he should have done the uh old chop their heads off picture yeah  but now you can't do it with digital it sucks yeah yeah you press the button i got scolded  once by norton it was camden we were doing a live broadcast i think it was ozfest i'm trying to  remember who it was i think it was rob zombie i'm not sure but we're getting pictures with everybody 
[02:14:00]  it was a really cool thing and jim i was camera guy like revolve in and he scolded me because after  the picture was taken that i should have known that the glare was going to come back off the window  that they were standing in front of and he was all bummed that we didn't do a dry run and see how  the window thing was going to interfere with the picture and blah blah blah and that's all i heard  for uh at least an hour or two oh fuck that was the famous had to be photoshopped picture right yes  i mean the picture was perfect you could see jim you could see if it was rob zombie i believe it was 
[02:14:30]  glare i hate the glare but he was obsessing with the glare that had didn't take away from anything and  then it was famously photoshopped yeah he figured out how to take the glare out he should just really hire  a professional photographer to go with them around with an amazing camera and he'll know  the angles the lighting all that stuff he'll snap 50 of them in five seconds and then he has a whole  roll to choose from it's like his head shots we'll send you to contact sheets tomorrow you know how long  it would take him to choose a picture and get he's a mad man selena gomez was here about a month or two 
[02:15:00]  ago i remember that so he got it set up like again like you know for him to get the vip picture yeah  and they bring her out to the lobby but i guess some of the bosses brought like their little  teenage girls here they certainly they're tweens yeah to get their picture so there's like like 20  girls out there waiting to get their picture with selena gomez and here we i walk in with norton  yeah i think i got a picture with her too yeah she's pretty yeah and that's another thing jimmy's 
[02:15:30]  taken a lot of pictures or i had a lot of pictures taken on his camera of me and people in the  studio i don't think i've ever seen a one oh really he usually sends him yeah he'll he'll  he's never sent one he's absent i don't think he's ever sent me one no he will he will he's  probably got a camera full of me i think he secretly hates me for not getting the randy johnson  secretly for no you secretly hate me oh uh the randy johnson photo that made his book where randy 
[02:16:00]  johnson blew him off yeah that's a great one i think he really wanted me to like try to risk my  life and run in traffic to get on the other side of the fucking street to get the front view of  randy johnson walking away from norton i i think i think he holds a grudge to this day over that one  too yeah yeah yeah i thought i was bad with the pictures we have all these metal guys on our show  and no matter how many times they're on i always get a picture i got like six with rob halford i've  gotten like 20 with lemmy over the years i just have to get an updated one yeah and i just hit up 
[02:16:30]  lemme lemme and half were on the same day this is like six months ago first show second show i got  lemme earlier i got halford so my guy fine and then at one point i see them both talking to each  other in a dressing room i'm like if i can get a picture with lemme and half of them at the same  time so i had to go back in there and interrupt their conversation they're like enough what you  were ready oh shit you let me was only had like one jack daniels so he was fucking cranky  and i i said i don't give a fuck i was supposed to be back on set i'm like i gotta get in and i 
[02:17:00]  got a picture with them i don't care if i pissed them off it takes two seconds i want to get  pictures but sometimes it's too much work dude i i couldn't do what jimmy does i was just as guilty  as jimmy with uh out in la um oh with chris cornell with uh chris cornell yeah it happens to all of  us guilty i handed uh i handed my phone to uh my girl there and said uh said uh the second i start  walking over and i'm even in frame with him just keep snapping just keep snapping i go i'm going in the 
[02:17:30]  pool he's in the pool i said i'm going to swim over and we're going to have a conversation in  the pool i go just snap go around the pool get so i was doing the same fucking shit jimmy does it's  like just keep going get every different angle and and i'm on purpose kind of holding my hands like  hey like hey i'm having a real conversation here we're in the pool and you know how just don't stop  snapping but i want 50 pictures i gotta defend you and everybody else in the room the difference yeah we 
[02:18:00]  all have those moments we got someone we want a picture with and you'll do crazy  shit absolutely but he does it with people that you shouldn't care about yeah yeah like  selena gomez if i had a picture with selena gomez that would be kind of cool if she was walking by  and i could make it happen sure right but not waiting around for someone like selena gomez you  know to to get a picture yeah that's the difference i think we all have people we really like that you  really want to get it like fuck i would love a picture of that person that's why iraq uh he's  learned over the years but the worst thing man by this no well but iraq knows what i'm gonna say 
[02:18:30]  there is so much pressure put on you it's worse than dealing with you two at times in here  because he'll come in he's right he runs down the checklist and his procedure he'll show you how to  hold whatever he's need to get he needs to get signed he already knows like once he's in there he  scouted the location of where you're going to take the photo unless he has to be brought somewhere  else to meet the celebrity yeah so which i think comes from from the glare he's the guy right we've  all been the guy by the way you're just the latest guy yeah yeah he bribes me with dinners and things 
[02:19:00]  like that and he goes well that's a good you can come in here i'll take it yeah steak dinner why not  i have a stock of boxing gloves and baseballs in the office oh yeah yeah just in case yeah just in  case somebody comes so yeah he had a stock fucking just boxing gloves and baseballs  generic boxing gloves and baseballs baseball players so that if a boxer or a baseball player  comes in what about footballs a lot of football guys coming through these days he had me pick up 
[02:19:30]  a nhl professional puck because that one time i said i was going over to the nhl store across  street oh my god he gave me money to pick one up and keep in the desk in case a hockey player came  around that he might know he doesn't even know hockey it's locked in the drawer you might know a little  bit about it but kenny it's jimmy could you pick up a good year slick don the snake through domes  coming in and i need it signed pick up a slick i don't know if we could do this break if jimmy 
[02:20:00]  was in by the way i know it's not not cool to do this to him but we've been trying to get this out  for a while but we're too scared to do it in front of him he was nuts yesterday when nascar people were  walking around i don't think he can name one nascar driver wait till you see his apartment's like a  museum he's got his last cases full of stuff yeah pictures hanging everywhere it's not it's a museum 
[02:20:30]  it's not a he's close to being a hoarder when it comes to yeah he's hoarding but that's his hoarding  the only difference between him and the hoarders are he hoards cool shit right it's like stuff  that's cool celebrity pictures we're gonna find him under a glass case one day this is a giant sabbath  fucking thing with the corner stuck through his chest as everything collapses on him in his apartment  there's a new thing lately if you if you want to watch him next time we have somebody who has a book 
[02:21:00]  to promote jim now does this thing with books if it's really important to him uh because i learned this  the hard way too if it's really important to him um the cover of the book has to be signed not the  they usually open up they open up and sign the inside and everything how is jimmy going to display  that in his museum exactly because in the museum that makes sense a few people get to see he wasn't  he wasn't here one time he's and maybe a friend every once in a while get to see this amazing collection  of his he wasn't here one time and i forgot who who was in the building but it was supposed to get the 
[02:21:30]  book signed and you know had the inside signed and he looked at it and he grits his teeth and  holds it inside after he smells the pages he grips and holds it right um then he goes thank you so  much and he's like he's like i really wish they would have signed the cover and i go i i didn't  know you didn't say that now i know because when there's a book to be signed where do you want it  signed inside is fine which means he wants the book but he's not going to display it it's not going  to be if it's got to be on the cover that's going to be put into a glass case in his house now i'm not 
[02:22:00]  crazy with getting like signatures of everyone in here like i said before if somebody important  that's cool to me or something i'll do that but in the old days iraq used to do something that i  wanted to fucking kill him for because i don't care about probably 90 of the people that come in  right i don't need photos with him i there's like shit like hot girls i like getting pictures with hot  actresses and shit like that it's kind of cool uh but most of the people don't care iraq used to come up  right in front of the guy and go anthony you want a picture wow and now i i'm sitting here and you 
[02:22:30]  know me i could sit here the whole fucking show right on my ass and not get up i don't care i'm  doing this show whatever and now i gotta be like yeah you rock yeah i want a picture well what started  out as this who gives not knowing thanks all right because it was i was just making sure you got a  photo that you didn't want later became i'll do it because that's the only way i could get back at  you for being yelled at for something yeah so it'd be like hey you want a photo and then i would sit 
[02:23:00]  there sure like yeah okay thanks iraq uh because you can't say no at that point then it's like nah  now this unimportant piece of shit now let him leave i do it to d-boy now because when i bring  certain people into his studio to get ids i'm like can derek get a photo and then he gets all these  photos with people that he has no interest about oh good hey uh rick in california i don't have time  to go to the phone right now but he he says bob kelly had to suck a dick for a steak eroc only had  to take a picture ah there you go yes poor paul back to yesterday's show i got um marilyn manson was 
[02:23:30]  at this award show and i wanted to get a picture with him that's a good one fan yeah you know it's  a tough one to get yeah sure he's not out in public and he was just blown by everybody so i knew he went  in this one room he just he was presenting an award i knew he was going to come out that door so i had  my friend stand i go look i'm just going to walk with him because there's no way he stopped because  there's people all over so just as i'm walking just snap it i'll ask him but just keep keep going  back we were practicing it absolutely just like jim north so he comes out and i go hey marilyn can i  get a picture with you he wanted nothing to do it supposedly you can't call him marilyn if you call 
[02:24:00]  manson he'll talk to you oh i didn't know that he made up his name so i said amen and he this is  the picture look how miserable he is oh let me see look at you you're like it looks like you're going  just snap it that's actually when we were walking look wow he is miserable god it's gotta be said  florentine's a mini jim norton you you get into this a little bit too don't you well there's certain  people but with certain people he hates you yeah that's hilarious holy fuck man yeah it's only with 
[02:24:30]  people that you know you like and i was like you know what i wasn't even mad i go look he didn't have  to break a stride fuck him yeah you know i didn't he didn't even have to stop as just as we're walking  you're still walking absolutely i just stuck my mug in there we make fun of him but noren's  probably got one of the biggest collections of probably of course he does gotta be right up  there with anyone in this country yeah well uh that was um hundreds of things hundreds thousands  probably at this point yeah well from what i hear it and i talking to keith and uh ang because uh 
[02:25:00]  keith's uh keith the cop's wife and uh did my whole house did my whole house decorated the whole  fucking thing it's beautiful the thing is my house was completely empty when she came in and  said all right clean slate i didn't want to because i had sat there a lot of times with my girlfriend at  the time looking through swatches and of material for one couch it took like i sat once for three  hours in a fabric store with this woman just babbling and and talking about materials and it's for one 
[02:25:30]  couch and it was a maybe right and i'm like three hours it will take years to furnish a house at this  rate so um uh i get ang in there to take care of it she did a fantastic job and jim has been over the  house and complimented my house and stuff and said i'd like ang to come over and you know uh hook up my  place so she went over there with keith and keith just sits down he's got his like freaking psp he's 
[02:26:00]  playing with on the couch as and just talking to jim and she's going well jim you know there's  certain things that i think because it's not empty it's a museum like we said yeah uh in order  to make it more of a home you know we'll have to take some of this stuff and that and jimmy's like  no this can't go i need this this is good i'm willing to and the things he was willing to do  is like all right i'll get rid of the coaster i'll get rid of one and like a hoarder like a hoarder  there's not one feminine like touch in his apartment and now that his girlfriend's over 
[02:26:30]  there a lot he wanted to like i don't know what he wanted to do he wanted to because i i know what  he wants to do and ang would come back to my house and just she she she was shell-shocked it likes like  she had just hit the beaches of normandy she's i don't know what to do and she's a professional  decorator and she goes i don't know what to do he really won't get rid of anything or put stuff in  away or in storage and and yeah that was something he said go this could stay right it can hold lots 
[02:27:00]  of stuff like that's his criteria if it could hold lots of stuff it's like no like like so she's like  all right let's start here with maybe um uh your dining room you know well no it's like my office  right it's like his office well okay we'll get a desk i don't want a big desk like anthony's no no  no we will get a desk that'll suit this and work good you know let's start somewhere else do they  give up uh no no haven't given up but she but she is beside herself she doesn't know what to do he 
[02:27:30]  won't give an inch yeah he needs to get a house and just make a whole room the museum that's what  it needs his place is not big enough to have a museum and a house a museum in the middle of the  thing if he wants to live in the museum that's fine and then i heard this was great because keith  told me this it's like you walk in and there's the bedroom and now now if you want to have a bedroom  that's that i guess a guy in his 40s and you want a kind of a classy nice bedroom it's very hard when 
[02:28:00]  the gentleman that owns the bedroom has a wall size kiss poster on the wall so it's hard to choose a nice  bed and and and you know fabric light fixtures a dust ruffle that goes with a kiss a wall size  billboard poster bigger is better with him i forgot i forgot about that poster i've seen 
[02:28:30]  that one it's just like i don't know what goes with a kiss poster you can't blow up anything bigger  than that fucking she's at my house and she knows because i just recently said i got i got to billboard  i kind of i go and i really could use like a new bedroom set because it's like the first thing i  got when i moved in and i got like raymore and flanagan crap instead of like really kind of nice  furniture everything else in my house is really nice furniture so i'm like let me get change my 
[02:29:00]  bedroom set and get something new and and she'll just be like all right she knows what i like she'll  come in with pictures which she did she lays them out in the uh in the kitchen i walk in i look i go  all right this is nice done so she's spoiled with with working with me with jimmy what goes with a  kiss poster as far as bedroom furniture goes how do you fucking make something like what would do you  pick that when you got this giant kiss poster on the wall that's awesome it's our little jimmy you 
[02:29:30]  know what the funniest after you wait four hours to finally get that picture and it's great you just  got you know everyone in metallica wherever it is as soon as they walk away and he looks at the  i'm a fat fuck like a fucking fortune what a fucking fat asshole i am yeah he's never satisfied  that's fucking awesome let's go celebrate a fucking fat piece of  look at my chin i have no chin look how pale i am my head i'm a fat mess look at me oh look at this 
[02:30:00]  our poor little jim so you got to la for the leno thing yeah that's where we were that was the  situation yesterday yeah seven hours from start to finish there's a full-time job yesterday yeah  you've worked seven eight hours you did that just to get jimmy to la and wait till the picture won't  come back to new york till bill ward's doing the show i think october 1st oh so it has to stay out  there for the next 15 days he's going to be checking on it in jonathan's office probably 
[02:30:30]  because we're not taping that's when we're going to see bill warden to sign it oh my before yesterday  he was flying a separate trip just to go out to get this picture signed i told my manager i said  why don't you just fly bill warden to new york and have him sign it he said he would do it  just fly bill warden to sign it for everyone yeah it's just oh man right so now that's got  to be in someone else's possession for a while yeah for a while now where is it going to be stored 
[02:31:00]  probably in the office which oh my manager's office yeah now isn't that the same office that  fucked up you threw out jack klugman and threw out the cigar box with the gastro fidel castro  this has yeah disaster written all over it and then and then if jonathan the manager brings it to his  place is it a safe neighborhood right right break up break-ins in the neighborhood yeah  because it's going to be there until october 1st so and then he probably won't i don't know how it's  coming back next time he does leno he'll probably bring it back it's got to lie flat yeah how is it 
[02:31:30]  going to get from the office where it's stored to the place where it's got to be signed yeah oh boy  this is this is a catastrophe i can't wait to that day on the set when jonathan has to bring it oh  oh and have him sign no no i don't i'm not going to sign i got i gotta i gotta get my hd flip into  his apartment oh yeah i'm gonna do a little video you have to he'll do it updated cribs  that's right we did one of those yeah yeah oh god he's that mold on his walls now he has kiss

[02:37:30]  something else going on before she oh yeah came in and did a little jÃ¤ger with us because the jÃ¤germeister  machine worked very well for us see me trying to save the client uh the jÃ¤germeister machine worked  very well for us for many many years until that incident but i think the girl like i said was already  yeah doing her own thing i got one in my house it's great doing uh chill shots of jÃ¤ger love that thing  fire it up press the button and you know pumps out yeah freezing nice chilled jÃ¤ger but i'm not

[02:39:00]  it's tearing me down you're breaking me and beating me down to nothing  love godsmack florentine's a godsmack fan too they were on um the crew fest last year yeah  blew away motley crew oh yeah godsmack went on before blown away i said this and some people got  a little mad but uh they warmed up for metallica at the nassau coliseum show a few years back and i 
[02:39:30]  thought i thought godsmack had a better set had to be honest maybe maybe metallica had a bad night  i don't know i've seen metallica many times love metallica yeah i did the snake pit man i was one of  the snake pit guys so i go way back with metallica but that particular night i thought godsmack had a  better set those guys are pros man yeah sully rules man and sully's got a uh solo album right yeah i  gotta check it's called avalon it just came out or it's coming out next week or something you haven't 
[02:40:00]  heard yet i haven't heard it but i hear it's a little it's different from godsmack yeah but  every band says that and then you get the record it's only like two songs that are different this  album's completely different you're expecting you know uh yeah whatever the like the last album it's  not gonna happen and like it's all these 10 in it 12 songs could have been on the last record right  right yeah you did something different on two stop it i like when godsmack and sully just slows it  down a little bit i don't mind that at all i love the acoustic stuff they do you liked right yeah  absolutely you like good times that they did good times bad times yeah that was off i think 
[02:40:30]  their greatest hit cd they threw that at the end great version of good times bad times godsmack  very good man uh we have a situation we always have a situation around here uh sam what's going on  i don't know why i'm always involved in this situation yeah all i saw was blind stevie our new  intern i i just uh tweeted a new picture of him trying to read by the way it's amazing you really got  to go to my twitter oh it's crazy uh and check it out but i guess uh there's a situation and as you  and i were coming back from the bathroom that was nice and we socialized in the bathroom yeah yeah 
[02:41:00]  we took our piss together it was nice it's like the old days uh just kind of talking and taking a  piss holding our cocks it's weird talking to you when the mics are not on and that doesn't happen  doesn't happen that often you guys don't call each other like they're not anymore  that's the age of the text and email who cares yeah that though i don't know i would  i would even take a text from you every once in a while join my family like if opie was feeling  like shitty had a call bad cold would you text him later today say how you feeling  probably not i wouldn't want i wouldn't want that though no no a text from a guy how you feeling 
[02:41:30]  are you feeling better or something like that if you i swear to you and and i'll put my phone down  right here if my sister's listening uh dawn text me right now about how i keep in touch with my  family that's all and i'll read her response okay and that will give you a little insight on  on everyone i communicate with or actually the lack thereof well it's going to be less and less with  your family now after you just told you people were peeping well sure her friends were eight and she 
[02:42:00]  was ten right right good point jim florentine i really have just sequestered myself in my house and  just shut myself off from everybody and i've got the asian girl across the way that's all i need i need  the asian girl in her window my fucking 50 caliber with the scope and your jaeger machine  and jaeger machine and i'm set hey uh sam's in studio so when we were coming back from the bathroom  man blind stevie he's blind he's legally blind yeah no she he came running right after sam and i 
[02:42:30]  really thought he was going to try to like punch you or a wall or something pointing his finger at me  going you you we got a you from blind stevie because basically he was i thought he was going  to punch you so did i like he was huffing and puffing and sweating profusely and he was like  you the only thing i had working for me was he had no idea where i was standing so yeah  he saw a blur that looked like um no because i sent him to he was just looking for things to do 
[02:43:00]  around here and just kept asking and and pestering people so i sent him to get the morning mashups  breakfast and i guess they sent him down to dunkin donuts and they asked him if he knew where it was  and he said yes and then 55 minutes later 55 minutes how far is it dunkin donuts is in the subway  station under this building so realistically for an average person how long would it take to go  down there get something and come back up even for an intern and it's like his first week oh boy uh 
[02:43:30]  like seven minutes would be like a nice long enough time to go and get a couple donuts and come back  55 55 minutes but why is he pissed at you 55 minutes he comes back with a tim hortons bag oh  well he just smelled donuts and he thought it was dunkin donuts his sense of smell is twice as good  this guy's going through live playing one long game of marco poll 
[02:44:00]  he sucks well well we got the morning mashup outside the studio they're not happy because they  were hungry for their uh for the last hour or so of their show starving hi there you go there's  nicole tin hortons no and they're not the donuts i asked for and he put the dirty money in with the  donuts that i have to put in my mouth he put your change in with the donuts all of it in the food bag  oh man listen if he didn't know where it was that was fine that's why i asked you yeah yeah i  know where it is and i would have told him it's right downstairs i wanted a specific donut right 
[02:44:30]  blueberry the mashup doesn't abuse interns they actually try to help them they treat them nicely  not like us and those dollars are all rolled up so you know they were in some strippers garter  from flash dances about two hours ago exactly i had uh i had nicole all paranoid like he probably  fucking walked into traffic and now he's dead and he's blind because of you and she started like  getting upset about it i mean it was longer than 55 minutes i think it was over an hour yeah goodness  what the fuck took him so long i don't know i refused to hear anything from him until he 
[02:45:00]  until i went in a public hearing yeah a public hearing yeah he's sweating too like profusely  and while you guys are in here talking to him about him on the air he's out there  like yeah now i don't understand why he came up an hour later with the wrong thing and  fucking dirty money in the donuts and he's pissed and me he's pissed well let's bring him in i don't  get this here's blind stevie his father used to beat him which is great i don't know what that has 
[02:45:30]  to do with anything stevie is such a oh the door he gets out with the door every time stevie what's  wrong stevie why what are you why are you mad i'm gonna kill sam all right he's gonna kill sam  why what's up because i asked him to do an intern task no no no here's what he does he pimps me out  he pimps me out to the morning mashup crew now i've just met these people today okay yeah i've never 
[02:46:00]  met them before hello i've never met them before today the outrage of me introducing to other people  i'm not done yet network oh no an intern actually meeting other people in the industry wow so now  he knows that's crazy two morning shows this is awful that can only hurt oh me and my conniving ways  that's not the whole story that's not the whole story so what he does he pimps me out to them and  they asked me to run an errand for them so they say okay can you go to dunkin donuts and pick us up to 
[02:46:30]  blueberry donuts or whatever this doesn't sound too bad well it'll get worse trust me and the call  said get something for yourself if you want as well oh oh and i mean the nerve of us thinking  he should run errands he's already been here four days wow so so here's what i did i get out  i get out of the studio i go onto the street and i figure all right well maybe it's two blocks away 
[02:47:00]  all right Nicole's problem Nicole asked you yep do you know where it is and you said yes i didn't  want to seem like a dumbass but what were you in actuality  now that's dumb you don't want to seem like a dumbass but you're being a dumbass because  why didn't you say what where is it she wasn't you think she would be oh dummy she would tell  you where it was i figured she was gonna send me somewhere out on the street not in a subway station  i've never been in a subway station so you thought you would wander around the streets of new york 
[02:47:30]  looking for dunkin donuts well there's so much crap in new york i figured one was  the whole world look like a dark tunnel to you anyway  i i'm sorry for sending you on this on this errand it's not your fault well i feel it's my fault  no you were just pimped out yeah whoa pimped out  these don't know yeah some tells me you look like you enjoy donuts i'll take the no i'll take  the money fucking hepatitis money in there he's like wet i'm gonna thank you nick fall yeah because 
[02:48:00]  i ran back i knew that i'd taken a long time and i'm thinking well 50 blocks i walked all around i  pretty much covered like a two mile radius around this studio and i figured well were you just panicking  yes that too he was that too he must have just been panicking walking around like i'm  fucking this off i'm fucking off do you have anyone's phone number who works here i called  the kid the kid the big every time he dialed he got another country john right 
[02:48:30]  what yes uh the kid who was here yesterday with us he's not here today why would you call  i texted him i texted him and i go well listen where's dunkin donuts because i need to get donuts for  these people and it goes in the train station so i figured he was talking about penn station and  i'm like fuck that i'm not walking that far i just walk around randomly for an hour there's only one  train station here in new york city why didn't he call 401 on his phone and ask what a fucking  nearest dunkin donuts is in midtown what kind of phone do you have do you have a regular dumb 
[02:49:00]  old cell phone it's not it's not an iphone who puts out the dumb old  wait it's a regular dumb old cell phone let me say oh that explains it holy  shit wow can that do anything like uh pinpoint location or find a dunkin donuts even it communicates  it's all it does worst case scenario oh jim norton's got a power cord for that yeah  worst case scenario he doesn't have anyone's phone number a human being with any sense would think oh 
[02:49:30]  i'm interning for a radio show that accepts phone callers and the person who answers the phone  works for the show call the show so if i call 866 wow one wow i'll be connected to troy and i can ask  him where dunkin donuts is but see i've had some problems in the past couple of days no getting  answers from troy right because he called himself there a couple of times and started that whole 
[02:50:00]  confusion name game with me was whatever  like dunkin donuts and tim hortons yes look i went to tim hortons watch out behind you  oh my god you see his face i'm not even happy with kenny today  kenny's not very happy with you what did kenny do to you there's a whole story there's a whole  story that happened before that immediately before this one happened i'm in the office with sam and 
[02:50:30]  we're just are you sure yes i'm sure right anyway i was there right i don't remember it could have  been anyone yeah you know yes he's been doing this all day pretending he doesn't know anything right  right so we're in the office and he's talking with me we're going back and forth and i know i  gave him some new bits that i had and he read them oh so if we want to do stevie bits we got lots  all right cool oh yeah i'll thank i'll thank sam um so anyway exactly 
[02:51:00]  he's not mad about anything well we realize five stories deep yeah you're five stories deep we still  don't know what happened so what can he do yeah donuts oh no okay why are you mad at me for the  donuts okay the donuts i'm mad at you because first of all first of all why would you send me to a  dunkin donuts in a train station because it's right out of the building closest one yeah but i didn't  know i don't know that they have dunkin donuts but you said you knew where it was stevie how is he to  blame you were asked if you knew where it was you said you didn't know where it was uh or you said you 
[02:51:30]  did know but you didn't you realized once you were outside that you had no idea where you were  going you walked around for an hour because you made the mistake and you know you made the mistake  so stevie are you mad at sam or are you mad at stevie i'm mad at you because first of all i don't  know the city and he's mad stevie you picked out the blind intern to other shows oh now he's bringing  up his handicap and there it is he should start by being mad at god by the way what you should 
[02:52:00]  start by being mad at god oh yeah i didn't make your mind stevie oh it's not my fault sam oh this is  not the time to make jokes with me and oh you're right now it's turning to get a little no not on the  air on a comedy show yeah not the time for jokes but i'll tell you what stevie it's  fucking stevie rules he's amazing if you'd like if it will make you feel better if we can be  friends again i will stop introducing you to people who work here and can possibly help you 
[02:52:30]  with a career hold on i will never do that again aren't bats good in caves kenny you should have  just went it's not the best i'm afraid you should have clicked and used sonar to find dunkin donuts  stevie don't you think if you're legally blind and you don't know too much about the city you  probably just wouldn't walk out and eventually hope to find a dunk of donuts like just bump into  one all the other places that i've been sent to are only like a couple blocks from the studio so i  figured this one's actually the same block but downstairs uh oh all right so you're like reason 
[02:53:00]  why you're like you're like con in the wrath of con your thinking is two-dimensional we sent you to  the closest you had to go down uh further than the street level and it was just in process see  right but there's four directions nebula right there's four directions you could have went when  you went downstairs did just you know what i mean there's not just one way to go you go it's got  to be a dunk of donuts this way because it's the only way to go up down left right i've never been 
[02:53:30]  to a subway station that had a dunk of donuts in it and i figured that there's no way there's  dunk of donuts well stevie you made an assumption and what happens when you assume ah  oh yeah you go blind you go blind that's correct i'm not gonna go through dirty subway stages  looking for a dirty stuff never even crossed my mind you didn't have to go through you said you  knew where it was which would mean you wouldn't have to look for it you just go downstairs to  the dunk of donuts i said i knew where it was because i figured i'd find it eventually anyway  find it eventually you know how this is very timely you gotta get get their food and breakfast it's 
[02:54:00]  my god they did a whole hour of the morning mashup hungry hungry because of you because of stevie no  blueberry donuts okay this it's not just this why don't we tell sam why don't we tell what happened  in the office when you called 911 on my cell phone twice and now there's cops there's cops looking for  me now are they looking for you yeah i don't know what happened you should ask them where to dunk a  though it's worse yeah there you go wait what's this about sam here's what happened i'm bad with 
[02:54:30]  cell phones and a lot of times when the interns every time we have a new intern i borrow their  phone and then for some reason my finger slips i don't know how these phones work and all of a  sudden it's calling 911 i don't know what happened no here's what he did he was on my facebook page  and wanted to know why my profile picture wasn't actually of me so what he did what he did was he took  myself he goes can i see your cell phone i'll take a picture of you and he so he takes a picture  of me gives it back to me and it says calling emergency or calling 9-1-1 or whatever and i'm 
[02:55:00]  like how sam how did this happen sam is an asshole i don't know and i said i don't know how it happened  yeah oh yeah he doesn't know even though i saw his you know finger clearly hit you know that he  clearly knows how it happened i tried to save the picture and all of a sudden it's calling so what  happened the cops came no so then he takes it he goes here oh i'm gonna see this for a second i go what  are you doing i'm wiping my fingerprints off the phone because i said i was gonna blame it on him  if the cops came for me and i get the phone back again and it says emergency again he's calling 9-1

[03:03:30]  remember that story from when we were on vacation yep and she went on cnn and she was talking like a  mummy like and i i laughed my fucking balls off in front of people that don't really understand me  or the radio show and i felt like a real fucking jerk turns out today that she did it to herself so  now i don't feel bad she did it to her why did she do it herself i don't know it's breaking news  but she was on cnn giving her exclusive interview making sort of was kind of light-hearted about it 
[03:04:00]  kind of and i was laughing i thought it was hilarious just because she sounded weird that  shit's hilarious and i got really a lot of dirty looks but now that i know she did it to herself i  don't feel the guilt anymore yeah is that good or what no absolutely yes tommy hello there how you  doing let's sit here i really i gotta apologize like we made you wait about a half hour so we  could talk to this this dopey i heard you shouting i heard you were annoyed oh i'm sorry yeah he's  blind really and and and we don't care and we don't yeah we don't care he said he knew where 
[03:04:30]  dunkin donuts was he didn't know he was he's lying we don't even have donuts in ireland they've been  outlawed really catholic church of band donuts oh because they look too much like vaginas it's the  hole you see yeah it's too much temptation too much temptation a lot of guilt a lot of catholic  guilt yeah yeah god damn that's one place i really want to go i've never never been guilt  no we go to guilt all the time guilt is a good country uh yeah ireland's just to me seems like 
[03:05:00]  the place to go why is that now it's very small because i know i know but that's kind of like i like  that kind of quaint thing and i love i love pubs oh yeah and i love guinness so for me that sounds  like a no-brainer well i was uh my ass there bored last night wandering around new york so i went to  hogs and heifers right right there's a bar yeah yeah yeah yeah and you get you get some guinness  there girls with leather bras and getting up on the stage bikers are up on their tap shoes it was great 
[03:05:30]  getting up on the bar and dancing yeah yeah any any civilian girls get up there because i know the  bartenders do that no it's just me a load of guys oh yeah it's kind of gotten to the point that's the  problem with those places when those places start out there's girls you know coyote ugly  same thing same thing and then it turns out to be a shitload of guys and these poor harassed girls  that work there that have to go up you know they got the the owner with a bullwhip that gets them up  there and they have they just want to mix fucking drinks for these savages and they got to get up 
[03:06:00]  and shake their ass for for these monsters because no regular girls yeah yeah no regular girls are in the  the crowd anymore because they think it's just a fucking there's about 14 000 bras yeah hung up  on the wall it's kind of like you know once there were women yeah it's like cave paintings  yeah because because they used to get regular girls that we get up on the stage and one of the  things they had to do i guess was take that bra off and and flip it over the thing and now uh it's 
[03:06:30]  you know jock straps well you know maybe there's a maybe short maybe there's a the equivalent somewhere in  some country where women go to a bar like that and up on the wall there's like underpants and  socks yeah yeah that'd be sexy skid marked fruit of the looms yeah tidy whiteys that's great there's  something about bra that's kind of sexy and fucking cool and you think wow the chick took it off and  she was wearing it once they were men yeah now it's just piss stained fucking guy hasn't changed his  underwear in three days it doesn't work the same way with uh guys and girls as far as uh that goes 
[03:07:00]  so uh where where are you gonna be what are you doing i'm uh over here for uh two nights and in  comics comics yeah around the corner from hogs and heifers yeah i'm right in a meat package yes  there's a great comedy club yeah so that is nice and then back to ireland on sunday so that's why i'm  here how does the uh how do you like the american audiences they uh they like your stuff i don't really  like them at all yeah they are assholes i'm not a big fan of people yeah you know something most comics  aren't we're not well you've gotten in some jam ups before because hey that's my style  that's your uh offend and leave your love of everything that is kind of cool you could get 
[03:07:30]  an ocean away yeah but uh people are too fucking touchy and politically correct i mean obviously  you had some problems with he talk about some down syndrome people and then they got all pissed off  and then uh you know isn't there something isn't there something kind of delightful about being the  autistic person in the room and just kind of saying whatever comes into your head there's such freedom  and letting you know letting people with full brain power deal with the consequences yeah yeah 
[03:08:00]  they have to you just described our radio that is exactly yeah let the people down the hall deal  with it we have autism yeah i can't tell you how many times they said ah i just said it for the  radio show don't worry about it because the parents had the kid out of wedlock it was a mistake to  begin with so like you know what fuck you now i'm gonna ruin your life there's something delightful  about uh driving a bus that has no brakes yeah you know there's just something wild about it now  did you get shit in ireland or america about everywhere everywhere yeah because america's  super uptight about that stuff not papua new guinea yeah people people there have been remarkably 
[03:08:30]  tolerant right but they're short as well the papua new guinians right very difficult to annoy them  they seem like a happy folk yeah they're short attention spans as well as legs and arms and what  were the consequences of uh some of the stuff you've done like um i know there was that some kind of  holocaust problem yeah people don't like what are the consequences of it yeah here with you 
[03:09:00]  we hear that we've done the same thing that's why we're sitting here instead of maybe being retired  already do you know people people who say these things like uh every moment everything in my life  has led to this moment yeah yeah that's it there are a few crossroads that i probably should have  made a left right i ended up here that robert frost form i took the road the least left and  that's made all the difference so here i am glad to be here destination radio yeah it uh you have  reached your final destination yeah everything seems that in in my life in my career uh everything is 
[03:09:30]  based on a consequence of something awful i've done it's just nothing good it's just based on  consequences of things that have gotten me in trouble well you know i used to have a line about  that it says career is the word they use when a car goes flying off the road it ends up in a field  so that's why i look for my career careering from one kind of one field to the next i thought  it was kareem is he not a basketball player my car kareemed off the road uh so yeah but i 
[03:10:00]  i i abdulled off the highway american audiences though they uh they no problem with the um  translation as a comic it would be hard to go either american comic going overseas or  from someone from overseas coming here kind of get because there are different cultural  things that might not translate yeah i have a guy that's that you know when um every now and again 
[03:10:30]  a comic has a a signer for the deaf and um right i'm an american translator an american translator  that can stand there and let the audience in on some of the jokes yeah there's no real difference  the main thing is not to make any compromises so not to try and be american or not don't try to be  understood oh okay i got you know so whatever do you ever get people just look at you dumbfounded  like what is he talking about why is he talking so fast oh is that it yeah you know that's something  because obviously your your accent isn't as bad as some people because some people in ireland 
[03:11:00]  i cannot understand yeah watching movies i can't like at all idea what they're saying yeah very  fast like like uh like what like can you remember an irish movie that you watch that you couldn't  understand maybe it was an english movie maybe it was train spotting oh it was that uh  irish movie yeah yeah mad max yeah yeah that one the one about the famine mad max yeah no brave  hard yeah that was it it's one island i don't know what it's not here that's the main thing yeah 
[03:11:30]  it's not here i don't know i don't really care no i just keep talking is the main thing you know and  whatever differences there are you hope that they're interesting rather than yeah about like when i when  american comics come over to ireland um or if i listen to american comics on cd and stuff like that i don't  want them trying to be irish right you know so i'm not going to try and be american what was your biggest  controversy my biggest one yeah i had sex with my sister that's a big one uh my dad paid me so 
[03:12:00]  my biggest controversy i have no idea i'm so offended i uh we've had some doozies yeah you  ever have a doozy you had to kind of work your way out of um i was on the front page of the jerusalem  post if that's a big thing yeah that would be big yeah that's probably a biggie i can only imagine  what i had a couple i had a canadian tour that was cancelled on me and an american tour that was  cancelled american tour though i can understand canadian because they they're kind of crazy about 
[03:12:30]  their um their political correctness and they don't know what it really do you know what it was it was  that um uh the comedy world now parts of the comedy world are kind of holding hands with corporate  worlds in order for comedy events to happen yes so the corporate side of things got nervous  um and then and they decided to pull me from the show and then i was supposed to do a tour of the  west coast and that was cancelled as well and so what was it about lawyers make why do they get 
[03:13:00]  nervous they got nervous because i guess the people who owned the theaters uh were jewish and the people  who and they said we don't we're doing it what was the uh jerusalem post thing about i i don't know  the holocaust it was irish comic mox holocaust so i send them an email but it said the clue is in the  job description yeah yeah but it's within comedy man yeah people like taking comedy and leaving  putting it in the same context as um a political speech right it's like no it's comedy and i don't  think anything's off limits in context anything could be funny so is it something you said on 
[03:13:30]  stage and then it got out there to you make a fun of holocaust or was it a tv interview or something  like that a big thing where i wanted to record a dvd and i switched that was the thing ah yeah there you go  uh yeah whereas i'm dressed in a uniform the crowd are dressed in pajamas yeah  that's what i wanted to do but that's see i never heard that yeah i didn't hear that's great  that's a tough nut to crack is it really i just have to get sponsorship on that one now florentine 
[03:14:00]  has no problem with that no no why in the name of comedy you know jesus wow i probably dug myself  another fucking whole night don't worry about it you're just trying to make not many of them in  show business don't worry about it i think you're fine yeah you picked the right group to go after  the eskimos run show business in new york don't they yeah you knew it's as they like to be called  those are people you can really just there are people you could just unload on the amish uh eskimos  and you'll never get in trouble puerto ricans they're not really that puerto the deaf 
[03:14:30]  you could for the asians for a while but now are you getting some now the asians have a great power  base it's very hard to goof on the asians anymore yeah especially on regular radio you can't even  make like the uh the asian uh voice sound that got someone fired just that just going like that  you're joking me no it drives me nuts and the guy had an asian girlfriend or wife and then there was  some there was some um actor or something like that made the chinese eyes in a picture and he had  to apologize yeah he's drunk with his friends at a party don't their eyes look that way yeah so he 
[03:15:00]  went like that and pulled them apart and why is that a problem i don't know because the world is  is crazy you know there's a uh an asian radio station right now and the guys go you know who you  really fuck with you know who you can really fuck with you can fuck a whitey white man very easy to a  goof on yeah but when the guy comes to my door with the fucking order from the sushi place it's always  20 a dollar 22 cent like he's not going at 20 22 dollars and 22 never so you imitate that why do you  get fired yeah i'm imitating somebody the way they sound why why would that get me in trouble 
[03:15:30]  don't get it at all i don't get it i don't know there's a kind of there is a culture of fear isn't  there is you think it more conservative in america or ireland where do you think the most conservative  of the country uh no i think america is just full of so many extremes like you can have a radio  station like this and you can have a bar like hogs and heifers where anything goes and you can but  you also seem to have this huge midland conservative reactionary thing as well so 
[03:16:00]  i wouldn't say america is one thing or the other you have both okay uh i would say in terms of loud  mouths yelling at each other in terms of countries that are conservative i'd say the vatican is probably  yeah that's a good one right out there there isn't square there's no opie and antony show in the  vatican a couple of priests are going around you know i'll tell you something who i'd like to  fuck tell me all the saints you wanna fuck that's a good one yeah yeah one of our bits cost us two 
[03:16:30]  years yeah that's a good one well what are you gonna do long years yeah we got fired for a couple  years and that was uh an irish cathedral saint patrick's cathedral oh look who it is oh we gotta  get him in yeah he's gotta get in here at some point he has to um in in ireland let's see how famous  are you in ireland who would you say in america version oh that's good of you are you joe biden joe  biden you're the second most famous person in ireland

[03:20:30]  fucking lose it one day with a gun and just shoot you i dream of that day true  coincidentally my uh my new news piece has a thing on uh the guy who killed john lennon who was in the  news recently what does that have to do with you two because they say i look like mark david  chapman is he is he due to be released soon or something chapman is he still in prison he said no  again he'll be there forever yeah there's just certain people that'll never never get out  manson's another one charles manson he'll never get out yeah like and he didn't even really kill 
[03:21:00]  anybody oh was he just he was just very suggestive yeah very suggestive oh can he spin a yarn why don't  you yeah text i got something for you how do you get life for why don't you why don't you that's a  great point it was horrific what happened to those people but but you know you can't put the guy that  was the why don't you guy is the why don't you guy the guy's got a swastika on his forehead he  shouldn't be allowed out of prison no well that's true but some of the people that actually did it 
[03:21:30]  got out yeah he could change that to a rubik's cube or something really good  oh you want to see manson walking around with that you can make a windmill out of it  something of an origami cash or something yeah come on gentlemen it's been a pleasure talking to you  what you gotta go yeah i'm gonna go he's a busy man yeah i'm gonna go thank you for having me  and i'd love to come wait you don't like the direction the show's going in i just i just  i just need a drink that's awkward oh yeah that's sort of why believe me you want to go to hogs and 
[03:22:00]  heppers i want to go back to guinness man i want to bring a bra back to our line thing was too much  probably yeah yeah yeah i feel for him yeah but he doesn't have down syndrome at least somebody does  oh shut it it's not about you he has up syndrome well i didn't know we only had a limited time  with you i didn't know we had a limited time with you oh maybe we don't maybe i thought you guys are  winding me up so i said i'll i'll make i'll say my goodbyes now we we want you to hang out already  okay okay yeah we're fine all right uh i want to know what took him so long he number one didn't 
[03:22:30]  have a fucking clue where dunking down he did not have a clue he walked around he went a full block  out of his way he was just walking around looking for a subway and then once he got down into the subway  he hoped that that was the right station and he just looked around and smelled around hoping  that's why i gave him the challenge because i knew you knew i knew even though he knows that it's in  the subway i knew he had no idea he didn't have a clue and he never even asked he didn't bother to 
[03:23:00]  ask the intersection which is directly next to the studio was don't walk okay so i figured someone  told you that yeah so i figured i'd go to the next block because that was open and walk i walked  across how do you know because i didn't get run over that's how i know right so he did run across  the street though he didn't know he wasn't sure it just turned green no i was gonna run out so i 
[03:23:30]  i figured i'd run beat it so i went and i walked out of the subway i walked down i looked just turned  green and i you know i saw the the dunking donuts colors and i could smell it so i knew i was close  for colors except he went out of signs he went a full like you walk out of this building if you walk  straight and across the street you can take that's the subway entrance he chose all right which is the  most inconvenient entrance yeah uh to choose outdoors but it wasn't that bad if he had known that that was  his entrance why would he come out of the building make a right make a left and make another left 
[03:24:00]  because i didn't want to wait because i had to beat the 10 minute mark which i obviously didn't do  anyway no because you didn't know where dunking donuts yeah you had no idea where what you said  you knew again for the second time i was all trying to lose this guy because he found me with a camera  freaking me out i just happened to be going downstairs oh yeah he just happened to have a camera pointed at  me the entire time why don't we send him to dunking donuts for a third time now and see if he can get  there yeah see if you could do it see if you could do it before the end of the show you know what
