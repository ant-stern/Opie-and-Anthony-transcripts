<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts establishing their shock jock persona, using profanity and making provocative statements.  Anthony's single life and his plans for his large, empty house (either a haven for "wayward coke whores" or potheads) were the initial focus. This segued into a discussion about a radio bit to find Anthony a prom date, quickly escalating into increasingly vulgar and sexually suggestive scenarios involving the prom date's parents.  Listener calls followed, with suggestions for Anthony's prom date image (like the character from *Boogie Nights*), commentary on Anthony's "creepy" demeanor, and corrections of their *Godfather* references.  Steve, a studio employee, was ridiculed for faking illness.  Listener suggestions for the prom date contest name led to further outrageous and inappropriate discussion.  A caller mentioned a man dying from eating too much cake, sparking a morbidly humorous running gag involving murder and Gypsy.

The show then transitioned to the 2008 Presidential election, focusing on a controversial photo of Barack Obama in Somalian clothing, speculated to be leaked by the Hillary Clinton campaign.  The hosts analyzed its potential impact, discussed newspaper coverage, and interspersed this with jokes and off-color commentary.  Sports-related jokes, including Barry Bonds possibly signing with the Devil Rays, were also included.  A listener-submitted audio clip of a bird (initially mistaken for a horned screamer) with harsh vocalizations was played.  The prom date contest continued to be promoted, with calls including one from a 16-year-old deemed too young for the contest.

The next segment began with playing more bird calls, followed by a discussion of Oprah Winfrey and Valerie Bertinelli, fueled by speculation about Oprah's sexuality and analysis of Bertinelli's reaction to a question about kissing a woman on Oprah's show using poker analogies.  The Oscars were criticized for low ratings and the omission of Whoopi Goldberg from a host montage, leading to the hosts discussing being overlooked in their own careers.  Various news stories followed, including a sex offender at a Borders bookstore, a pretzel resembling the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus sold on eBay, and a woman's death on an American Airlines flight, all interspersed with the hosts' opinions and jokes.  Callers shared voyeuristic experiences, prompting discussion about the line between voyeurism and perversion.  An upcoming movie screening with a possible Andre 3000 appearance was mentioned.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the woman's death and other news.

The following segment started with a discussion about a family's complaint of lack of oxygen on an American Airlines flight, followed by a caller, Mark, detailing explicit voyeuristic experiences while repossessing cars.  The hosts then discussed two teachers facing sex charges: a male middle school teacher accused of soliciting explicit content from underage boys and a female teacher's aide having sex with a 15-year-old student.  Their commentary was sexually explicit and graphic.  Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000) then called in to promote *Semi-Pro*, discussing his musical preferences, fashion sense, filming *Revolver*, his love for chess, and other topics.  He confirmed a special screening for the show's listeners.  After the interview, the hosts discussed seeing Gary Coleman and his wife at XM Satellite Radio, speculating about their sex life,  and further discussed their upcoming animation festival, including USB wristband giveaways (jokingly suggesting USB cock rings as an alternative).  They also mentioned fan websites, briefly interviewed a man resembling George W. Bush, and promoted the TV show *Quarterlife*.

A subsequent segment featured an interview with Bitsy Tulloch from *Quarterlife*.  Tulloch discussed her roles, the confusion around *Lonely Girl 15*, and other acting experiences.  The conversation shifted to the differences between internet and network television,  a bizarre story involving a booking agent's on-air prostate exam to book guests (including Tulloch), and a playful casting call for *Quarterlife*.  The hosts also discussed past controversies, Hollywood gossip, and a planned, but unfulfilled, on-air stunt.

The final segment focused on planning the animation contest, discussing sponsorships (aiming for $2,500 from XM as a backup), venue options (Beacon Theater or Giant Stadium), and USB wristbands.  Frustration with Steve about logistics was evident.  Listener-submitted "lines of the day" (many obscene) were read, and the tasteless "prom date" contest for Anthony was revisited.  The hosts discussed past segments and a potential "feedback show" format.  The segment concluded with chaotic and irreverent banter, heavy profanity, and sexually explicit jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives where we use these unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where entertainment is going.  You're a drunk pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver letting you suffer.  They are sick freaks.  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Sud, sud, sud. 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  What?  Good morning.  This is always the awkward part of the radio show.  What do you do?  What do you do?  You just kind of say hi.  How you doing?  You comment on the little music thing.  Just awkward for everybody involved.  Just go, hey, how you doing?  We're here.  You give them a big good morning.  Good morning.  But you don't want to sound overzealous.  Yeah, you don't want to sound like a hack show or something. 
[00:02:00]  Right, right, right, right.  Hey, good morning to you.  Well, here we are ready to broadcast.  I guess we could be a little more professional.  But screw it.  They gave up on that years ago.  Us being professional.  The first words on the radio show shouldn't be,  why isn't this life fixed?  Yeah.  Where's my cereal?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we're here.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  We're here.  Again.  Again.  I was going to do a chant for everybody.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Really shake things up.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  You got onaradio.com.  That's a fine website that links a lot of the visual things that we talk about on the radio show.  Also has Stephen S. from Bayshore's Rundown and other fine little things to check out.  So keep that in mind.  You got the instant feedback. 
[00:03:00]  Have they?  Ah, whatever.  Why am I asking?  I already know the answer.  Why?  Why would they?  There's an instant feedback that's linked on onaradio.com.  Uh-huh.  But that's not the one we read here in the studio.  No.  So don't even bother using it.  And they want me to acknowledge that there might be a PD in the house.  Okay, sure.  Oh, really?  Take care of the basics and then I'll acknowledge you.  Ooh.  How are you, Anthony?  Very well.  How's single life treating you? 
[00:03:30]  Good?  Good.  Yeah.  It's just in my house last night.  Mm-hmm.  Kind of big.  Big.  Big.  Empty.  I notice it echoes a lot.  Very echoey.  Yeah.  But I am able to fling all the doors open to all the rooms.  Because, well, when little Jack-Jack was walking around.  Little Jack-Jack.  That's your little cat that you miss.  Little cat.  Hardly.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I was trying to keep him out of the rooms. 
[00:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because so then he wouldn't, you know, muck up any of the other beds in the bedrooms and  stuff like that.  But I could just fling him open and the curtains are open so it's nice and bright.  It's bright and sunny.  And I was able to sit down and play Call of Duty for as long as I wanted.  That's nice.  That was it.  I just sat there for hours on end and played.  Yeah.  You're like Richie Rich.  You're like Richie Rich if he was able to grow up to be an adult instead of staying young 
[00:04:30]  and in cartoon form.  Yep.  You have no responsibilities.  No.  All the money in the world.  Fancy cars.  A fancy house.  And a lot of video games.  It's just, yeah.  And I finally decided, oh, maybe I should eat.  So I went to the fridge and...  And saw nothing in there?  No, no.  Because the cook was there yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She had cooked the food.  So it was all in the fridge. 
[00:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I was able to make something to eat.  But for the most part, I just hang around now, eat, drink, and play video games.  Oh, my God.  You should have like a cargo line of people coming through your house to take care of you.  The cook.  The maid.  The shopper.  The duster.  The stripper.  What?  Well, Keith and his lovely wife came by yesterday to discuss some plans about decor in my house. 
[00:05:30]  Because she's very good at that.  You know, getting some actual human furniture in there.  Mm-hmm.  And they were very nice.  They actually, like, folded my laundry and...  Oh, they feel sorry for you.  Yeah.  And unloaded and then reloaded my dishwasher.  Oh, that's a sign that they feel sorry for you.  No.  Let's go over to Anthony's and make sure he's okay.  They were being very nice.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  And, yeah.  Take care of all that.  That's a sign that people are worried about.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  He's just going to live in his own filth if we don't go over there.  Yeah.  They're going to have to put me in the shower.  Well, are you going to work on, like, a home for, you know, girls?  A home for wayward girls is what we were discussing yesterday, I guess.  Now, I'm not sure if I want wayward girls, like, that have maybe psychological problems or coke whores.  Because I'm thinking I could open up a place for coke whores. 
[00:06:30]  I got a couple of bedrooms.  No.  I could open it up like almost a rehab center.  But my trick is I have a crap load of coke in the house.  So, you know, a coke whore will do anything for a little coke.  No.  Stop with the coke thing.  That keeps everyone a little too hyper.  It's old hat.  You want potheads.  I don't know.  You want to keep them mellow.  Let me tell you something, though.  You want to keep them mellow.  Pot does not have the reaction that coke does. 
[00:07:00]  Girls that are there for coke will do anything for coke.  Pothead chicks, you know, they still hold on to their morality a little bit.  Not really.  Coke heads, though?  Wayward coke head girls.  Yeah, but, you know, there's going to come a time you're going to have to start talking to them because they're not going to want to sleep ever.  No, just coke.  They're going to be just grinding their teeth.  So, what do you want to do now, Anthony?  No, they have to stay in a certain part of the house that's, you know, relegated to the wayward coke head girls. 
[00:07:30]  And then I am in the administrative center of the house, which is where I sleep and do my business.  I come in and check on them every so often, make sure everything is okay.  It's pretty obvious to everybody that you certainly don't want to be married, don't want to have kids.  No.  So, yesterday I came up with the idea that you turned into some kind of, like, playboy mansion.  Yeah.  And you went with the wayward girl thing.  Yeah.  It's easier.  I'm lazy.  Hot wayward girls.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Well, I don't care.  None of that emo crap, right?  You don't want emo girls, right?  No.  I don't care.  Whatever.  Come on in.  There should be.  You're right, though.  There's a scale at the front door.  There will be a scale.  A way scale.  Like, you have to.  It's open all the time.  You have to get on it before you're on that.  You have to get on.  It's a foil it out.  And then there's an entrance to the door and a little exit on the side for those that  don't quite make the top back to the street.  Yeah.  They don't even know it's there.  It's actually the welcome mat.  Yeah.  Right above the door inside, it shows the weight as they're ringing the doorbell. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So, I could just look up and go, oh, no.  And start treating them like a...  And then you push your button.  That is the trap door that gets rid of them on a nice slidey slide.  I will treat them like meatloaf in Fight Club.  Yeah.  Standing on the stoop, calling them disgusting and fat.  Yeah.  You can't come in here.  If they're over a certain weight, the buzzer just disconnects so you don't have to be bothered  with their fat finger ringing the bell.  Yeah.  No sound will be heard in the house at all.  No.  Exactly.  If it's over a certain weight, yeah, the doorbell doesn't even...  Yeah, it doesn't ring. 
[00:09:00]  No.  That's a good idea.  I'll have to have that installed immediately.  So, and then the other thing we started on the other side of the show, got to clean it  up for this side.  Mm-hmm.  We're trying to find Anthony a prom date because we noticed that he breaks up this relationship  a long-term relationship right around prom season.  Yeah.  And we're thinking that there might be a girl out there that would actually go to the prom  with you this year.  Go to the prom.  Yes.  So, I would be going to a prom. 
[00:09:30]  But...  The high school students.  But there's some stipulations.  Yeah.  I mean, the polls are already lit with girls that want to ask you to their prom, but...  See, the...  See, the girl has to put out...  No, see, the problem, it got way out of hand yesterday.  It wasn't just me going to a prom with some stipulations.  Yeah.  I had never heard such disgusting stuff coming out of Jim Norton about what these girls need  do, what their obligations will be for me to go to the prom with them, what the father's 
[00:10:00]  obligations will be.  Wow.  It got a little ugly.  Sure.  I don't know.  There's no reason a father should have to smell my fingers at any point.  Oh.  That's degrading.  Degrading.  The concept...  The concept was innocent enough.  It just kind of took off and...  It got away from me.  Yeah.  Just a little...  Yeah.  It took on a life of its own, but...  It turned into me getting in the limo in the driveway.  Yeah.  As the parents just look on proudly. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  The door of the limo shutting.  Yeah.  Some noises.  Yeah.  The window cracking from the inside.  Yeah.  Where you still can't quite see what's happening.  Maybe some muffled screams.  Yeah.  Me leaving the limo.  Yeah.  You don't even go to the dance.  I don't go to the dance.  No.  It turned into some rape.  And the parents horrified.  Well, when Anthony Shelby would be parked by the side of the road.  Yes.  It's still running.  He's going to be in the limo for a few minutes. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And the part you forgot was, after the inside of the limo incident, the window cracks a quarter  inch, and you put your lips to it, and you'll, I need a washcloth.  Oh, my God.  And the mother has to bring a warm washcloth for you.  Yeah.  This isn't...  And listen to her whimpering daughter in the vehicle.  Because the excitement for the girl is to actually have you at her prom.  At the prom.  She's going to be, you know, Queen S if you're walking around the prom with her.  Who wouldn't?  But that's the beauty of our bit.  See, Anthony never actually goes to the prom. 
[00:11:30]  I never go.  Oh, the whole set up.  He'll get a tux and everything.  Apparently.  And he'll put a little corsage on your daughter.  Oh, I'll nail the corsage right into her breast.  But it never really goes past the driveway.  No.  Apparently, all...  Of the parents' house.  All it turned into was me sexually assaulting her in the driveway and then leaving in my own  car.  It was...  Hey, look.  The millionaire shows up.  It has to be a senior prom.  The girl has to be of age and improve with identification.  Of course. 
[00:12:00]  We wouldn't want to do anything...  Nothing illegal or immoral.  Illegal, right.  Something that the girl wants and the parents are happy about.  And you show up.  Yeah.  What you do is you still have your tuxedo is still in the hanger.  It's still in the little bag that comes with the hanger.  The dry cleaner, yeah.  And you get in the limo with that and then you get out with it still on the hanger.  Like that one.  There's like blood splatters on it.  Oh, my God.  We're still holding out hope that we can get you to a prom, though.  See, any discussion like this is not going to really help, I think. 
[00:12:30]  I understand, but this is kind of a hacky radio bit.  It's been done many, many times, but it's never been done in the O.P. and Anthony style.  Well, of course not.  So we're truly open to the possibility that there might be a girl out there that needs  a prom date and Anthony is single and he likes young girls.  Is that the case?  So we'll just kind of leave the door open and see if this thing takes off. 
[00:13:00]  Let's say hi to Scott in New York.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  You know, I picture Anthony like that guy from Boogie Nights with a little Asian guy throwing  firecrackers around.  Hell yeah.  Who was that?  That was good.  Very nice.  He loved the Night Rangers.  What song did he love so much?  Sister Christian.  Yeah.  You got Sister Christian for a girl.  Sister Christian.  Motorin'.  And he's just got the Asian guy blowing off the fireworks. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  What a great scene that was.  He's dancing with his robe.  He's on a coke bench.  There's a guy throwing firecrackers.  All right.  Listen.  Now I'm going to want to hear the whole song.  It's one of those guilty pleasures.  Guilty pleasure.  That's one of my guilty pleasures.  I'd always put that on when I was playing Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah.  I tuned the radio station to that.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Steve in Cincinnati. 
[00:14:00]  Hello, Steve.  Steve, I want to correct you on one thing about the wayward girls wanting to talk to Anthony  in the house.  Yeah, yeah.  Snow.  He's an older gentleman and he's creepy.  And whenever he comes in to talk, if they're not high, they're going to be like, he's kind  of creepy, don't you think?  More coke.  Yeah.  And then the bag opens up and Uncle Anthony's not creepy anymore, is he?  Anthony seems a bit happy, though.  Something's going on.  Yes, of course.  And those doe eyes of his.  I'm a very happy man. 
[00:14:30]  Let's go to Cincinnati, Ohio.  Steve, what's up?  Steve, wait a minute.  Let's...  Oh, it's the wrong Steve.  Here's our Steve today.  Is that where you got that from?  Yeah, it's the godfather.  Is that Turek Forehouse?  No, not Turek.  No, that's where he's dropping dead.  That's actually godfather.  No, I understand what you just played, but there's a bit where you do that cough. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What bit is it?  I forgot.  Where you go...  I think it's Turek's Whorehouse.  Best coughing death ever.  Yeah.  So...  Tomatoes getting knocked at a rolling.  Our Steve came in because he was sick yesterday.  Yes.  And he didn't want to get anyone sick.  Uh-huh.  But he's here today because, of course, all the germs just fled his body overnight.  He doesn't think he'll actually get people sick today.  And he's walking around with sick voice.  Everyone's accusing him of having fake sick voice. 
[00:15:30]  Are you kidding me?  We're 10 guys that never want to work for 11.  You don't think we know how to do sick voice?  Sick voice.  So Steve's like...  Every day when I was working.  Uh, I'm, uh, going down the hall to, uh, uh, record Black History Month, the nominee  for today.  I'll be, uh, back in a little while.  Yeah.  He's, uh, doing his best Clint impression.  Don't forget you got a screening of Semi-Pro after the show today.  Oh, we do.  Punk.  Just faking the, uh, the sickness.  Can we hear...  Can he come on mic?  I want to hear him talk.  Oh, it's great.  He doesn't sound like cool Clint. 
[00:16:00]  He sounds like heartbreak Rich Clint.  Yeah.  The one that just did it.  Not like the old days Clint.  Yeah.  Where it was cool to sound like this.  He sounds like the throat cancer, Clint.  Here comes sick Steve.  Yeah.  What is, what is, uh, sick voice?  Yes, Steve.  Oh, sick voice.  Sick voice better.  Sick voice better?  How did, how is it better?  You came out sounding horribly.  When you left the office, when you were sounding like this, and then you walked down the hall,  I heard.  So Tim, I'll, uh, I'll, uh, I'm coming to production to... 
[00:16:30]  It wasn't that bad.  Oh my God, your voice completely changed since you were out of our...  I got my, I got my throat drops, so I'm hoping those...  Wait, you don't have sick voice anymore.  Yeah, I know, because I'm numbing my throat with it.  No, because we called you out on it.  Now you look like how...  You feel stupid.  If I was faking, I'd admit it, but I'm not.  What happened to...  Travis, help me out!  What happened, like, literally a half hour ago?  Uh, guys, uh...  Yeah.  You're looking happy today.  I'm still sick.  Completely different.  Oh, please.  I never do the walking wounded thing.  I never do.  Your voice is completely different from a half hour ago. 
[00:17:00]  You leaned over, you leaned over Opie's computer, and we're pointing at something, and you're  like, yeah, this is, uh, we'll grab this, and...  You notice some of the animations are now up on the website, but...  Yeah.  And now he's talking normal.  Now it's just Steve again.  Yeah, exactly.  Poor Steve.  I don't care, you know, and I just know that I'm gonna walk in here.  Stupid kid's just babbling. 
[00:17:30]  Just pours DDT on him.  I didn't realize.  Hey, can we do a Steve remix going into break?  Where's that disc?  We haven't played those in a while.  Hey, uh, Steve, what do you got in Cincinnati there?  Hey, I had a pleasure for Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes.  I just want to know, how big is his house?  Square footage.  Square footage.  He's got about, uh, he's got about 2,000.  2,000 square feet. 
[00:18:00]  Perhaps more than that, Opie.  Really?  It's, uh, it's a good size.  Let's just say that.  Yeah.  Good size.  Hey, uh, I got a name for your, uh, prom contest.  Okay.  Well, we came up with a name yesterday, but...  Oh, we certainly did.  I don't think it'll wash, though.  How about prom poon?  Prom poon?  That doesn't even come close to yesterday's selection for a name.  No, no.  Yesterday's selection, let's just say, cut right to the chase.  Oh, yeah.  Go right down to the brass tacks. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Put it this way, the description of the contest's name, um, uh, would be me going on the prom date  and never having to look her in the face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, the word spread was in there.  Uh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot that one.  Yeah, so let's say hi, Chris.  I was thinking of, uh, there's chocolate prom, and there was an...  Yeah, that was...  Prom C was one.  Right?  Chris in the Poconos.  How's that heart-shaped tub?  Uh, it sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm calling to see if, uh, E-Rock's all right. 
[00:19:00]  I heard a man died the other day eating a cake.  Yeah, E-Rock, uh, thank God you didn't die from, uh, that cake.  It wasn't E-Rock.  What?  It wasn't E-Rock, thank God.  It was a cake-eating contest or something?  And some guy had...  What did he die of?  Did he choke?  Cake.  I don't know.  You can't die of cake.  Died of cake.  We learned you could die drinking too much water.  He died of cake.  Sam, we found Duncan Hines in his pulpit hair.  Here comes Gypsy.  He died of cake, apparently. 
[00:19:30]  He had frosting on the corner of his mouth.  But it wasn't in his hand, Sam.  Somebody put it there.  Do you think so, Quint?  That's right, Detective Monaghan.  It was murder.  Of course it was.  Gypsy, it's always murder.  Can't it just be something else for once?  Why does it always have to be murder?  It's always murder.  He never just picks up a body that died of natural causes.  I have frosting all over my members-only jacket.  It's always murder. 
[00:20:00]  And the frosting was so smooth, I could spread it with my girlfriend's flat cardboard knife  ass.  And your stupid boat.  I live on a houseboat because pederast laws don't apply in international waters.  I don't do anything.  They're just so cute when they're that small.  What did he die of?  It was murder. 
[00:20:30]  Gypsy said so.  Good enough.  We've got to take our first break.  He's frosting on his mouth and not in his hand.  It's obvious.  Yeah, we're going to do that one.  Number one.  Listen, we're going to take our first break.  877-212-018.  We've got lots to do today.  We've got the Obama controversy.  It's on every front page.  Oh, yeah.  His picture.  The Hillary Clinton campaign really stepped it up and I think did a great job, even though  they're being called out on it.  It's called throwing in the kitchen sink.  Yep.  They're a little desperate.  Oh, this desperate move, but it's a pretty good job. 
[00:21:00]  It's on the cover of every paper.  I think they look bad.  The Clintons look bad.  It looks bad.  Look what they're pulling this time.  It looks bad to people that think.  You've got to realize most of the country just looks at that and goes, ah!  Well, now we don't have to discuss it because that was our angle after the break.  We'll talk about it a little more after the break.  Also, Whoopi's crying.  You've got Oprah.  The Oprah clip is great.  Yeah, love it.  The Oprah clip is great. 
[00:21:30]  She had Valerie Bertinelli on and I know we're a dude's show here, but they were talking about  kissing women and Valerie Bertinelli asked Oprah and her reaction was,  uh, priceless.  Great.  And we'll get into that after the break as well.  But first, in honor of Steve being, yeah, sick voice, sick voice Steve.  But he wasn't sick voice on the air.  I'm fine now.  He's suffering from a, I took a lozenge.  He's suffering from a dented tonsil. 
[00:22:00]  Is that it?  That's right.  I had a hip in each hand.  I couldn't control him.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got a crushed tonsil.  Yes.  Something banged into it last night.  Looked like Muhammad Ali working the speed bag.  Yes.  Ouch.  It looked like a little fleshy boxing glove.  Right.  Muhammad Ali just doing rights to a speed bag. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, here's Drew Boogie.  Steve hates midgets as we go to break.  Opie and Anthony.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Thank you. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[00:23:30]  Every other day when I was working for a living.  We all did it. 
[00:24:00]  Hi.  Hey, hi, Lou.  Yeah, I'm not going to make it in today.  Oh, I feel like crap.  Such, it's really bad.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just going to take the day so I feel better for tomorrow.  That's right.  I don't.  Wait, hold on.  Yeah, I was just coughing.  Sorry.  Okay.  Tomorrow.  What? 
[00:24:30]  And then we call him out on it and he comes on the air and has his normal voice back.  And then he's like denying that he ever talked sick only a half hour ago.  This place is insane.  It really is.  Before we set up the next little segment on the Opie and Anthony show, we have to do this.  One, two, three, four, five, six, 2008, Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State.  She's going to do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  We'll see. 
[00:25:00]  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be your president, Hillary Clinton.  That answer is false.  With plans to make our dreams come true, Hillary Clinton, there is nothing she can do, never  heard the word impossible this time, except keeping her husband from doing things to insurance. 
[00:25:30]  She's going to do it, on your market set and vote now, got a dream and got the know-how.  With plans to make our dreams come true, working for us all day, yes, all day, yes, all day.  She's working for us all day, yes, all day, yes, all day, yes, all day, make all our dreams 
[00:26:00]  come true, for me and you.  Man, I'm loving this reality show.  Yeah.  It's just a reality show.  Oh, the whole election?  Oh, my God, it's the best reality show on TV.  You never know what's going to happen.  Can I tell you something?  I think it's pretty obvious.  I hate politics.  Yeah.  I think they're all just full of crap.  Well.  I hate politics.  I barely follow this stuff, usually. 
[00:26:30]  But this time around, man, it's got my interest.  Yeah, they're really taking some jabs at each other.  Yeah.  You never know what's going to happen on a daily basis with these two.  Yeah.  Hillary and Obama.  It's not even like they're going after McCain, really.  They're kind of, there's no real unity there yet.  No.  But the second one of them becomes the Democratic nominee.  The other one will be like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  This is the best person for the job ever, ever, ever. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  But meanwhile, all that stuff I said before, just don't even think about that.  I was in the gym yesterday, and I was thinking why I want Obama to be president.  And it's a very simple thing.  The show?  Well, it's very good for the radio show, because you're going to lose your mind.  In the end, I don't really care.  But if I had to pick one, I would go with Obama.  Yeah.  And I was thinking, why do you really want Obama?  And I remember being a kid and learning about President Kennedy.  Oh.  They were going to say, I remember being a kid. 
[00:27:30]  And it comes down.  And what my father used to say about those people.  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  That was me.  I think my dad saved that for the VA hall.  Was that it?  He didn't bring that home.  But, man, when I went to the VA hall with him, wow.  Words were flying.  Wow.  Yeah.  But they all were doing it.  Of course.  The black vets, the Polish vets, the Italian vets.  They just rag on each other.  Oh, my God.  They were amazing.  But anyway, it's as simple as this.  I want a young president.  Oh.  You learned about Kennedy when you were growing up.  And you're like, wow, it must have been really cool to have a young president. 
[00:28:00]  With some young ideas.  Right.  And some young energy.  And you knew he was banging, you know, really hot broads in between signing things with 100 pens.  Nice full head of Kennedy hair for Oswald to aim at.  Sure.  Whatever.  Not old and gray.  But it came down to that.  It comes down to that.  I just want a young president.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, this time around, the choice isn't that great.  I'm not going to sit here and think and tell people that Obama's amazing. 
[00:28:30]  He lacks a bit of experience.  But I still.  Sure does.  I still want someone young in the White House.  Like, old white guy is getting just old at this point.  Yeah.  But we still have a country.  McCain was babbling on TV this morning.  I'm like, another old white guy.  Just, argh, argh, argh, argh.  Like Frankenstein.  Yeah, just saying old white guy stuff.  But old white guys kind of kept the country together.  Has it?  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  We're still here.  We've been a bit of, we're on a downturn.  Well, that was because of the last white guy.  Last white guy wrecked.  Last white guy kind of screwed some things up.  For everybody else?  Yeah, and that was on the heels of, you know, a bunch of Arab guys in airplanes.  Mm-hmm.  So that could get screwed things up.  But I don't know.  Is the answer young black guy?  Or menopausal white woman?  Or really old white guy?  Or old white guy?  Or oldest white guy ever? 
[00:29:30]  Wow, do we have a choice.  That's what I said yesterday.  Out of all the people that live in this country and all these qualified people, we get this?  And a woman with her seeds drying up.  A black guy that I don't think has ever been out of his state until the election.  Yeah.  Until he's going around campaigning.  Yeah.  And old Frankenstein.  He can't lift his hands up above his head.  Look, we all got to acknowledge that the choices are a bit weird this time around. 
[00:30:00]  Mm-hmm.  But Obama, the big news today in this reality show, you got Obama in Somalia.  Yeah.  Somalian garb, right?  It's on the front page of the New York Post here in New York.  It's pretty much on every paper today.  And it's obvious that Clinton's people put this out there.  Hillary Clinton is saying, I have nothing to do with this.  Oh, oh, oh.  She's saying that?  Huh?  Hillary Clinton.  That voice.  She's saying that.  Well, this is what she's saying.  All right.  Hillary Clinton is denying involvement in a new photo of Barack Obama circulating on the web. 
[00:30:30]  Now, the picture shows Obama in traditional Somalian dress during a visit to Kenya in 2006.  It was posted by the gossip and news website Drudge Report.  The site claims it received the photo from the Clinton camp.  The Obama camp says it's part of a smear campaign.  It says the photo is trying to fool voters into thinking Obama is Muslim when he is, in fact, Christian.  The Clinton campaign says if Obama's camp wants to suggest the photo is offensive, they should be ashamed of themselves. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, what a brat.  That's great.  You should be ashamed that I put this picture out in.  The post says a hilarious cartoon.  It's Obama saying to Hillary, I don't complain about the way you dress.  And she's dressed like a witch.  Yeah.  Oh, that's brilliant.  You know.  She just sucks.  Her whole camp sucks.  You know, everyone knows that when these politicians go overseas and stuff, they dress, you know, like the locals. 
[00:31:30]  George Bush recently was, like, looking like an African.  Oh, that was ridiculous.  That was kind of creepy.  They hold hands with Arab leaders.  Yeah.  Yeah, they walk around holding hands in the Rose Garden of the White House.  How embarrassing is that?  But for the most part, most Americans are very scared of Muslims.  And you see a picture like this, and that's all you have to say.  You know, you're not even looking any further.  You're like, oh, my God, he dresses like a Muslim.  It is, you know, the Clinton campaign and the Clintons over the past eight years have done nothing but bash George Bush about his use of fear of Muslims and Arabs, which I don't see as being unjustified. 
[00:32:00]  But using that fear to get his own means, you know, whatever he wants.  Right.  And she's doing the same thing.  Yeah.  She's using that fear that people have.  She knows that people are going to look at that picture and go, ooh, I kind of like him better in the suit and tie than with the turban and the I hate America wear that he's wearing there. 
[00:32:30]  This will definitely be effective.  Yeah.  This will get people a little nervous, unfortunately.  I think it will.  I think smart people will look and understand, you know, it's ridiculous.  But there are some, you know, this country is pretty big.  Obama is claiming that, yeah, this is absolutely fear mongering what the Clinton campaign is doing.  And in the Daily News, they're showing Bill Clinton with a turban on his head from a past visit when he was in India. 
[00:33:00]  That's a sea rag.  Yeah.  They got a picture of Hillary with a pointy hat.  Yeah.  She's got one of those Chinese hats, right?  Yeah.  The pointy hat.  It's the hat they used to wear when they were working on the railroad.  Actually, it was when she was touring Vietnam.  So there you go.  Oh, is that it?  And then you got President Bush in a Chinese jacket.  That's when you're used to throw a grenade in a helicopter with.  Yeah.  A lot of apocalypse.  The difference between the Daily News here in New York, they show those pictures of, you know, some key people right there. 
[00:33:30]  You got President Bush, you got Hillary, and you got Bill Clinton in, you know, traditional local garb or whatever.  The Post only shows Obama, and they don't really.  But they do say it's a photo smear.  Oh, they do say that at least, Jimmy?  Yeah, it was the Barack Muslim photo smear on the cover.  Yeah.  People were familiar with the Clintons and all these other presidents' religion when they would do this.  And all you would do is look at the picture and go, wow, that looks wacky, them dressed like that.  But there are people that still think Barack Obama is a Muslim. 
[00:34:00]  And when they see him dressed like that, it just affects them.  And that Muslim thing was kind of sneaked out there as well.  Let's get people thinking that he's actually a Muslim or used to be a Muslim or there was some kind of Muslim connection.  And now with this picture, look, you see, he dresses like a Muslim, too.  The Clinton campaign is doing some of the most dirty, mudslinging tactics I've ever seen.  And she's holier than thou about the whole thing. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, she's desperate, man.  She's lived her whole life to become the President of the United States of America.  Yeah, this is a big shot, her big chance.  She even put Bill in there first.  Yeah, it was just a prerequisite.  Yeah, that was just to set her up to be President.  Are you kidding me?  So now it's looking really bad.  Obama nationwide has caught up with Hillary.  And I think actually more than caught up, he's got a nice lead.  And they're saying it's desperation at this point for Hillary and her campaign.  I want Frankenstein in. 
[00:35:00]  Do we have other newspapers?  I want to see how other papers are covering this.  Because the way these two papers are covering it, it's not like it doesn't make Obama look bad.  It looks like a photo.  They both say smear on the head.  It doesn't matter what's said, though.  It's like that old, you know, it happens in courtrooms.  When somebody says something and they object and the judge says, okay, don't listen to that.  But they heard it already.  It doesn't matter what's written on the side.  All you've got to do is look at that picture and go, okay, why is he dressed like that?  What the hell is that?  Yeah, I agree with you. 
[00:35:30]  What is the Boston Herald saying?  What do we got in Cleveland?  What are they doing with this?  We got him dressed like that on a rooftop with an RPG.  Aiming at one of our Blackhawks.  Yeah, why don't they, you know how in the back on the sports section, the post, we'll put like the Yankees in a Marlin uniform.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't they do a little photoshopping on the front?  A little photoshopping.  Put an RPG in his hand.  Show him from Blackhawk down.  Just get a clip.  Sure.  Pointing at a white body and laughing.  Oh, God.  Speaking of sports, did you read that Barry Bonds might sign with who? 
[00:36:00]  The Marlins?  Where's our sports expert?  Devil Rays.  Devil Rays.  Devil Rays?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  He might be signing with the Devil Rays.  Ew.  The Giants didn't want him back.  No.  Which kind of proves a lot, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  The year after the guy sets the home run record, you don't want him around.  You get rid of him.  Oof.  And the Devil Rays are thinking of picking up Bobby Bonds.  Bobby, jeez.  Barry Bonds. 
[00:36:30]  What year is this?  Barry Bonds.  That'll get some people in the seats, right?  I guess so.  But, yeah.  Well, that was kind of a scummy move.  They also had Fred McGriff.  Tampa Bay years ago, Fred McGriff.  They always get these guys that are ready to retire.  The Devil Rays just stink.  Why don't you guys stop it?  Get some young players of your own.  Well, we've done the bit.  Kind of like the Yankees.  We've done the bit over the years where you see these very famous sports stars in weird uniforms. 
[00:37:00]  And it just doesn't look right.  Yeah.  I forgot all of them now.  But, like, Walt Frazier was a Cleveland Cavalier way past his prime.  And what were some of the other ones?  There was a website.  They showed these guys.  It was like, you remember them in a certain uniform.  And then they're, what do you got there?  Jordan.  As a wizard.  Yeah, Jordan as a wizard.  Hank Aaron as a, was it Met?  Oh, no, no.  Willie Mays as a Met.  Willie.  Yeah.  Very bad Met.  Well, it was 50.  Yeah.  We were looking at some of the covers of the newspapers over there. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, good, good.  Boston Herald's got fishy finance.  But then in the side, there he is.  Pure over this Obama photo.  There it is.  Any other papers there, Iraq?  That's all.  That's the Herald.  All right, well.  Well, I thought maybe we'd get a few papers.  Let's just go, one city at a time, one medical order, starting in Alaska.  Go to some web page where there's all the covers of the newspapers. 
[00:38:00]  I know there's one out there because I've seen it.  See, this is the type of thing we probably should do before the radio show.  Yeah.  Be a little prepared.  Well, he's saying.  I mean, everyone's talking about Obama in a dress.  So, yeah.  So, as a radio show, you try to, like, enhance that and figure out ways that we can have fun  with this.  Yeah.  You know, what's up there?  It's Obama in a dress.  It's Obama wearing a dress.  Obama wearing a dress.  It was a dress.  It was something about a dress.  You in a dress.  Something in a dress.  Jimmy's interview.  That's right.  Lee-lee.  Yeah.  The sites that do do all the... 
[00:38:30]  Do-do.  What?  The front pages of all the papers.  Yeah.  I do not update until, unfortunately, later in the show.  Oh!  All right.  So, maybe later in the show, we can do the bit we want to do now.  Let's say hi to Ed in Jersey.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ed.  There's a story down in Philly, right outside.  There was two brothers that got in a fight over Hillary and Obama.  Yeah.  And the ones have the other ones.  Yeah, this...  He didn't die, but don't die. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, that's a big story today.  You got two brothers.  One's for Hillary.  One's for Obama.  And they get into a huge fight outside Philly, too, huh?  Yeah, it was, like, right outside, like, Montgomery County or something.  And two Puerto Ricans, surprisingly, with noise.  That's being very stereotypical.  That's right, sir.  Philly definitely doesn't...  If I know Philly, and I think I do, I don't think they want Hillary or Obama.  No.  No.  They don't have an open mind when it comes to... 
[00:39:30]  They want Frankenstein.  Yeah, they want Frankenstein.  Now, Philly has one section that certainly wants...  Oh, yes, absolutely.  Oh, well, sure.  Yeah.  I'm sure they weren't working hard today.  All right.  All right, we get it.  Jesus Christ.  Something else?  I'm trying to be clever and veiled.  Want to make a hubcap joke?  Jesus.  Anthony, fullblownease.com.  No one heard what you said.  Okay.  All right.  He tried it again.  Uh-huh.  Oh, it's fullblown.  I thought you said cold, cold something.  I don't know.  It sounded like Bernays.  I don't know what he was saying. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, we have Craig Treadway here in New York.  He decided to act like a valley girl.  This is a quickie as we go right here.  Oh, horrible.  What's this story about?  It was a couple of bitches.  A couple of bitches got kicked off a plane because I guess they were wearing stuff too revealing.  What were they wearing?  Why are they having...  A little short skirts, I think.  That's not right.  And their tops were a little revealing for the cleavage.  I don't know.  I don't know who the people are that are kicking these girls off planes. 
[00:40:30]  Almost.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Yeah, that works.  Most people hate to fly.  Like, give us a little eye candy.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  Well, you're scared that you're going to, you know, plummet to your death and you look  to your left and you got some girl, you know, dressed like Britney Spears.  And you kind of have an impure thought before you die.  That might be why.  Might be good.  Okay.  That's true.  That'd be it then.  But they were talking about the story and then the girls apparently, the news crew decided  they were going to imitate the way the girls talked in Valley Girl fashion. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  Because it's 1984.  Right.  Or something.  Whatever year that was.  82.  So you get this.  A news guy doing this.  And like, in Florida, two 18-year-old girls say they were treated like unfairly on a Southwest  Airlines flight because they were like too.  By the way, this is.  Oh, Jesus.  This proves how effed up we are as a country.  This is a black guy.  Of course.  Doing a Valley Girl impression.  But if you do a black guy impression. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Fire!  Fire!  You couldn't do that.  They threw a black woman off the plane and she said, why are you throwing me off the plane?  Let's see Sam Champion pull that one off.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Do the impression.  Go ahead.  Okay.  One needs to get somewhere.  That's right.  She sang Old Man River as they dragged her off the plane.  And everyone's laughing in the background as they're all being fired.  Fired, fired, fired, fired. 
[00:42:00]  Totally and completely fired.  Stupid.  So fired.  But a black guy, you know.  Yeah, he could do whatever he wants.  And like in Florida, two 18-year-old girls say they were treated like unfairly on a Southwest  Airlines flight because they were like too pretty.  The college students say the flight crew was like rude to them.  One of the girls claims that when she got into a heated argument with another passenger over using the bathroom, the flight crew only like questioned her.  The police later escorted the girls off the plane and it landed. 
[00:42:30]  They were not charged.  Southwest Airlines has banned them from any future flights.  As is.  Wow.  Like shut up.  I mean just because they look like that?  Yeah.  I mean oh my gosh.  Are they too pretty?  Like let's go to Jill Nicolini now.  Totally.  Totally girls.  Okay.  Good morning guys.  And Jill didn't get the joke because she talks like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to see a nice stereotypical black voice. 
[00:43:00]  Of course.  Please.  Yeah, you won't say that.  No, why not?  I wonder why.  A little bit of a, well there's a couple of double standards out there I guess.  When did the local news turn into like morning zoo radio shows?  It really is.  Just read the news.  Like.  Oh, really?  It happened when Kennedy was assassinated when Cronkite came out and he goes, did y'all hear what happened in Dallas?  Yeah, exactly Jimmy.  Never happened.  Not with Cronkite.  No. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know.  You turn on these morning news programs and they got to be wacky and zany.  Doing impressions.  Every ethnicity represented.  We get it.  Yeah.  We get it.  Thank God you can get real news on the internet now.  Thank you.  Thank you to the internet.  Whether you can believe it or not.  Right.  Hey, we got to play Surfer Dude.  I mean, because you got the Valley Girl.  Oh, yeah.  It leads into Surfer Dude.  This guy's for real.  We love Surfer Dude.  But the park is still flooded.  So you'll see kids out there again today.  Some of those kids today will be my co-hosts.  It's just like, dude, you got the best barrels ever, dude. 
[00:44:00]  Just like, you pull in and you just get spit right out of them.  And you just drop in and just smack the lip.  Hoopah.  Drop down.  Snap.  And then after that, you just drop in, just ride the barrel and get pitted.  So pitted like that.  It's a way of looking at that wave and saying, hey, bud, let's party.  That is a real life picoli.  I was turned on to that clip months ago by AJ and just ignored him. 
[00:44:30]  Just get pitted.  That's a wonderful clip, man.  Did you get pitted, son?  He really enjoys his surfing.  Good luck getting a job.  Good luck on that one.  All he needs is cool birds and tasty waves.  Yeah.  All right, Hamilton.  After the break, remember yesterday we were talking about that screamer bird?  Yeah.  One of the faithful listeners sent in audio of the screamer bird. 
[00:45:00]  You're not going to want to go anywhere.  Horrid.  Oh, my God.  Why are there any of these left?  Why aren't they extinct?  And by the way, remember the bird noise we played yesterday?  And I thought it was the screamer bird.  It was the bird that Than recorded when he was away in Mexico.  He was at a wedding.  And this bird was waking him up every morning.  And I was thinking it's the same bird.  You remember yesterday, right?  This bird, I'm going to play for you after the break.  Oh, my.  You might turn around and slap your wife this morning.  No, the one we played yesterday, the bird from today, 
[00:45:30]  makes that bird yesterday sound like a little robin red-breast tweeting in your backyard.  Yeah, after the break, we'll play the bird from yesterday,  and then we'll play the actual horned screamer.  It's called the horned screamer.  I want to thank Robert from Dallas for finding this,  because we were looking for it all day yesterday.  It doesn't sound like anything that could actually be alive.  Oh, my God.  We'll do that after the break.  And also, we're going to do the Oprah clip.  It's pretty damn funny.  It's really, really funny.  I hate birds. 
[00:46:00]  And then we're going to reset and maybe do a real break on the Obama picture later on this morning.  Oh.  Why?  Let's acknowledge that fell flat.  Well, we need covers from other papers, I think.  Yeah, we'll do that later on.  Let's go to break.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, who's going to be in Cleveland this weekend.  Nice.  Friday night only, two shows.  Let's get right back into this.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:30]  From instant feedback, you got Bob Larson from Manorville.  He writes, let your teenage daughter get pitted by Anthony on prom night.  Pitted.  Oh, okay.  He came up with a name for the contest.  Yeah, we're trying to find a prom date for Anthony.  It is prom season.  And Anthony is now officially single.  And we're trying to develop this contest there.  And, yeah, Bob's name is actually this.  Let your teenage daughter get pitted by Anthony on prom night, dude, contest. 
[00:47:00]  I don't really see that working.  I don't think the names of the contests are really going to help out getting contestants  based on maybe their parents and things like that.  We've got to soften our delivery, I'm thinking.  Do you think that?  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  Because I'm kind of thinking that won't do it.  Is there a girl out there that needs a prom date?  Jesus.  How about help daddy pay that mortgage?  Anthony will admit to being 42.  Prostitute voucher. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Give us a call if you want to go to the prom with Anthony.  We're dead serious.  I know this is a hacky radio bit, but it's never been done this way before.  Do I have to?  I swear to you.  Do I really have to?  Well, the only thing that we cannot change, the only thing, we're willing to bend a little  bit, but if you're a potential, here it goes, if you're a girl, a bit lonely, you don't 
[00:48:00]  have a prom date, it's the only thing we're not going to budge on.  You have to put out for Anthony.  The other stuff, how you put out and all that, we're willing to bend a little bit.  A little bit.  Three different ways you have to put out.  I am not going to sit here and sound desperate.  The only thing we will not change is the fact that you definitely have to put out.  Whatever your definition of putting out is.  Let's maybe get that definition from the ladies. 
[00:48:30]  I think.  Negotiate a little bit.  You're setting me up for a bunch of little piggies.  I want to go to the prom.  Yeah, but what if they put out?  Girls that would not be, and that goes back to the thing we discussed a few days ago.  What's that?  About the fact that they put out, or chubby girls are better at doing certain things.  It doesn't matter to me.  I don't want to look at that.  All right, get the chart ready, because we've got to figure out the... 
[00:49:00]  Oh, turn down your radio, please.  Martina.  Yeah.  We've got Martina from Jersey.  How old are you?  I'm 16.  Uh-huh.  Too young.  All right.  Well, we'll be the judge for that.  That's terrible.  You're 16.  Yeah, I need a junior prom date.  You need a junior prom date.  Wow.  All right.  What do you expect on a prom?  What's your idea of a really good prom?  I think we've got to be careful, because she's 16.  Oh, it's fine.  To be honest with you. 
[00:49:30]  Because the bit we want to do, we need the legal age of consent.  What's the legal age of consent for Jersey?  That creep Dan Natterman knew.  Of course you did.  17.  17.  When's your birthday?  Tomorrow?  Yeah, if your birthday's tomorrow, give us a call back.  What do you want, though?  What's your perfect prom date?  Fun.  Fun?  Well...  And what?  And funny.  Oh, fun and funny.  Well, that's me.  Jesus.  Anthony is?  I'm so fun and funny. 
[00:50:00]  He's very funny, and he always has a pocket full of Vicodin and other barbiturates.  Yeah.  So he's fun, too.  Oh, it looks like a tin of Altoids, but...  Do you underage drink a little bit?  All right, listen.  Um, yeah.  All right.  Look, the phones are lit with girls that we could possibly talk to.  I hate to do this, but this is where we would get fired for the third time.  No, it's only if you get inappropriate.  I understand.  I think I'm just carrying on a conversation.  But we're dead serious.  We want to get you to a prom in the next couple months there, Anthony. 
[00:50:30]  Um, okay.  What...  Just describe yourself a little bit.  Okay.  Um, 5'2".  Okay.  Petite.  One...  132...  132 pounds.  All right.  I hear some Hispanic in you.  That could be a problem.  Oh, actually, um, I look Hispanic.  I sound Hispanic.  I even speak Spanish.  But I'm Egyptian and Lebanese, so...  Egyptian and Lebanese.  Good.  You and Anthony can have interesting political banter in the back of the limo. 
[00:51:00]  As I'm punching you in the face.  I guess we found the werewolf that Bob Kelly, uh, saw.  Oh, yeah.  How often do you have to wax?  Hourly?  Oh, my God.  No, never.  I just get my eyebrows done.  That's it.  Oh.  Do you get that unibrow thing going if you don't?  No, I don't...  Uh-uh.  I'm not a werewolf.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You don't have any bombs strapped to you or anything like that?  And would you go to the prom with a guy?  Just, you know, as a goof.  As a what? 
[00:51:30]  Never, even as a goof, would I go to a prom with a guy.  But it's okay, because it's a goof.  Mm.  All right, Martina.  Thank you.  My sweetheart.  When I was 21 or 22, I was dating a girl who was in high school, and I had to go to  her senior prom, and it was so creepy, because I was older than all of her friends, and  then the next day, she went down the shore with, like, some guy that she was banging on  the side.  It was really...  Oh, oh, Jimmy.  Or Jimmy.  Or Jimmy.  Poor me.  Nothing.  It was so stupid.  We're going to find you a prom date, Anthony.  Yeah?  Yes.  All right.  Well, that was...  That went nowhere, though. 
[00:52:00]  Well, just because...  Well, the age thing.  A little...  Oh, trust me.  If she was legal, we would have had a little more fun with that.  Hey, we got this bird thing.  It started out as a goof yesterday, but it's taken on a life of its own.  I was reading the New York Times on Sunday, and there was just a dumb little article  about this bird called the Horn Screamer.  Yeah.  And what's going on, it's in South America.  It's only in a couple places in South America, and this bird is so obnoxious that it's driving  people from their homes, and a lot of homes are for sale because they're beautiful. 
[00:52:30]  They got waterfront property.  They're in a really nice neighborhood.  It's like...  It's a dream.  But these birds...  But these birds, and you as the buyer, you have no idea, so you're like, oh, my God,  what a deal on this great home, waterfront property, great neighborhood, whatever.  What, do the realtors bring the people by when they're not making these noises?  Oh, you know, the realtors are scum.  So they probably know, like, these birds do this at night or in the morning or sometimes.  When they're sleeping or nesting. 
[00:53:00]  Absolutely.  It must be like one of those movies where you've got to get home before dark.  Yeah.  Where they're like, oh, we just want to take another look around a little bit.  No.  No.  We have to leave now.  Right.  No.  It's I Am Legend again.  So leave.  The article is great because that was the whole gist of the article, that people are  pissed because they're buying these homes thinking they're getting a great, great house, and  these birds are driving them nuts.  So yesterday, a little twist to the whole thing, Than was in Mexico for a wedding, and  he recorded... 
[00:53:30]  He didn't know I was reading this article.  Yeah.  And he recorded a bird that was keeping him awake.  Donkey show for the bachelor party?  It's Mexico, no?  Yeah.  Got to go to TJ for that.  So every morning, Than was being woken up by this bird in Mexico, which turns out to  be a different bird.  And Than recorded the bird that was waking him up every morning.  And it is an obnoxious sounding bird.  I'll give you that.  I don't know which bird I ate more.  Really?  I'm not sure, yeah.  Oh, really?  Wait till you hear the horned screamer.  But here's the bird that was waking up Than yesterday. 
[00:54:00]  We played this.  And I said it sounds like a rusty car trying to be start.  Oh, you're trying to start, yeah, yeah.  Trying to start a rusty car.  Yeah.  Where the whole engine is just rusting away.  Yeah, you have to choke it.  This is the sound you hear before someone goes, you have to pull the choke.  Yeah.  Don't be confused.  This is not the horned screamer.  Right.  It's the bird Than was woken up by.  Actual audio from Than's Visit.  That's all you'd hear from my house. 
[00:54:30]  That's all you'd hear from my house.  Got one.  Got one.  It hit the roof. 
[00:55:00]  Very good.  I see that.  All right.  So there you go.  That last one was when you shoot yourself because there's too many of them.  Too many birds running out of ammo.  Save the last bullet for yourself.  They just keep on coming.  Are you ready to hear the horned screamer?  This is the horned screamer.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:55:30]  Way more obnoxious than the bird that woke up Thad every morning.  Here is actual audio of the horned screamer.  Hey, that's not the audio of the horn. 
[00:56:00]  What happened there?  That was a sweet boy sound.  That was part of our contest.  The most annoying 30 seconds ever.  A contest we had to stop because it was really, really bothering people.  Oh, yeah.  This bird is really bad, too.  Yeah.  You got it, Ant?  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony's got the actual audio of the horned screamer. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's not that.  That's the North American fat-bellied zilch.  It flutters in a circle around the Boston Harbor.  Goes nowhere.  Unless it's under the wings of the giant Dane bird.  Yeah.  Here's another...  The horned screamer?  Yeah, the horned screamer.  All right.  Here we go.  Actual audio. 
[00:57:00]  We got to get to the audio.  Is that the horned screamer?  No.  That's the Florida incompetent willow.  It does nothing but stupidly buzz over radio stations and wreck their signal.  Feeds on mayo.  Actually eats cake.  The only bird...  Is that it?  A cake-eating bird?  It's a cake-eating bird.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  And then there's one that eats things that sound like cake. 
[00:57:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Of course it is.  Sorry.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present you the actual audio.  Yeah.  The horned screamer.  Not too bad, right?  No.  You can handle that.  Definitely.  Okay.  Kind of relaxing.  Right.  Right. 
[00:58:00]  I don't have to kill that thing.  It's a seal with wings.  It's a seal with asthma.  Like, it starts off okay.  Yeah.  You're like, all right.  A little guitar mixed in with this.  All right.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Driving people from their homes.  Sounds like Chrissy Snow laughing.  Yeah.  These things should be extinct.  Human beings should have just done away with these.  Yeah.  This is what dinosaurs sounded like. 
[00:59:00]  Danny said it sounded like Q-Bert.  Q-Bert.  It's a $50,000 fine for killing them, and that's why.  Yeah.  Oh.  Because everybody wants to kill them.  What could they possibly be contributing to this planet?  You're right.  I don't care if their turds have the cure for cancer or them.  I want them all dead.  Would that drive you nuts, Jimmy?  I hate them already.  I've heard them for three seconds in New York, and I hate them. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  That isn't even earthly.  No.  There should be the cantina music should be playing behind that.  The Star Wars cantina music.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Boop.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  What's up?  Hey, Steve.  That sound that that bird makes is the same sound that Steve's hybrid makes when he honks  the horn in traffic. 
[01:00:00]  Frunkus to you, sir.  Yeah.  I haven't heard of Frunkus in a while.  All right.  Changing gears.  So there you go.  That's the horned screamer.  Yes.  Horrid.  Horrid animal.  My lovely girl was watching Oprah yesterday.  Why do you allow that in the house?  Oprah?  You can't allow the chick to watch Oprah.  Man is not a true man if he lets his woman watch Oprah.  No, but did they start reading the books she recommends and then the relationship has problems  and they start seeing the flaws? 
[01:00:30]  My girl don't like that.  I don't allow that in my house.  She was watching Oprah.  She likes to watch Tyra and wow, but she likes to watch these shows the way I like to watch  them just to goof on it.  Yeah, she can't get enough of Tyra and goofing on, you know, Tyra just talking about herself.  Well, yesterday I was horrid yesterday.  I was doing a little that dumb Omaha, which is just it's the luckiest card game ever invented.  No skill whatsoever.  And she's she yells for me.  She goes, you've got to come in here. 
[01:01:00]  Oprah is talking to Valerie Bertinelli about kissing girls.  Which is like, OK, cool.  Valerie Bertinelli is admitting a lot of stuff now that she's divorced from Eddie Van Halen.  And Oprah.  Now, there's been rumors about Oprah.  Let's just be honest with with the people out there.  There's been a lot of rumors.  A lot of people are scared to talk about it.  But a lot of people are saying that Oprah is a lesbian.  She don't know.  Got that Stedman, I guess, is the boyfriend.  Right.  And been a boyfriend for how many years? 
[01:01:30]  Forever.  Forever.  But you never see him anymore.  And they're not married.  They're not married.  He looks a little questionable.  It looks to me like a very genuine relationship.  Yeah.  You see a lot of affection between the two of them.  Sure.  They hit knuckles before they go to bed.  It's been rumored that JL possibly is more than a friend.  And Oprah has denied that.  A lot of denials.  We have no idea.  But they're floating out there.  And then one of the websites showed a picture of a really hot black woman that hangs with Oprah all the time. 
[01:02:00]  And some people have claimed that that might be something.  I want to make it perfectly clear.  We have no effing idea.  We don't know.  What do we know?  There's certainly some suspicion out there.  Who is she?  Oprah's assistant?  Is she like an assistant?  I don't know.  But she's some kind of black model that is gorgeous.  I forgot what website had that.  Really?  It went away fast, by the way, too.  She can make things go away.  So Oprah's talking to Valerie Bertinelli.  She's got the pounds.  And this is what's weird.  Oprah's allowed to ask whatever question she wants. 
[01:02:30]  But then the person asked the question back.  And now all hell breaks loose.  Okay?  So here's a clip of Oprah asking Valerie Bertinelli if she's ever kissed a girl.  And this is how it went down.  Just listen.  Listen closely.  And then we'll decipher what we hear here.  You also wrote about passionately kissing another woman while you were married.  Did I write about that?  Yeah.  She was a good kisser. 
[01:03:00]  She really was.  That's why I just said, as I was reading, I would just tell everything, you know?  Have you ever kissed a woman?  No.  Okay.  No, we don't start.  There's rumors again.  No.  No, I'm sorry.  I really haven't.  No.  No, I believe you.  And if I had...  You'd let us know.  I know.  Yes, you'd let us know all the time.  You'd let us know all the years ago.  Yes.  Yes.  Now.  Now.  Now.  That is...  That's nervousness right there.  You could not get the no out fast enough.  Yeah.  You could not get it out fast enough. 
[01:03:30]  My favorite part was Valerie Bertinelli.  Oh, we're not going to start those rumors again.  Yeah.  She was just trying to awkwardly talk to her.  Have you ever kissed a woman?  No!  No.  It's like...  We were talking about this in the back room.  Oh, like a poker.  In poker terms.  Yeah.  In Texas Hold'em terms.  Yeah.  When you're sitting there and, you know, you want to bet correctly so you don't chase  everybody away and your card turns over and you hit the full house.  Yeah.  You're sitting on two pair and you're hoping another ace pops up, let's say. 
[01:04:00]  And the second the card flips down and hits the top of the table, the second it happens  and you see your full house, it's in the air.  But you can see that it is an ace.  It's your ace and you go, all in!  All in!  All in!  Oh, you hit your full house.  Oh, damn it.  Is that being obvious?  Now, I do study this stuff thanks to Charles Getzinger, my fine professor at Geneseo, who 
[01:04:30]  taught the class interpersonal communications.  I was trying to remember.  Oh, who?  And I don't know.  How she answered this question, there's something going on.  Whether she doesn't want the rumors to start again or she's covering up something.  But not only does she say no really quickly, then she, Valerie Bertinelli is just a quick  question and Oprah kind of harped on it a bit there.  No, no, I would, oh, no.  She elaborated, yeah, she was just like, she couldn't say no enough.  Yeah.  Or quickly enough.  Yeah, listen again. 
[01:05:00]  She really was.  That's what I just said, as I was reading, I just, well, just tell everything, you know.  Have you ever kissed a woman?  No.  Okay.  No, we don't want to start those rumors again.  No.  No, I'm sorry.  I really haven't.  No.  No, I believe you.  And if I have, I'll let you know.  You don't let us know.  I told you years ago.  Yes.  Yes.  See, Valerie Bertinelli is even like.  She got scared.  Like, oh, my God, Oprah's going to kill me.  Yeah, Valerie.  She's going to have me killed.  Feeling a little weird.  It's like, no, I believe you, because Valerie Bertinelli is a throwaway question. 
[01:05:30]  I know it would have, would have sufficed, but Oprah had to go, no, no, no, no.  Hey, we don't want to get those rumors started.  I didn't even notice that the first time I heard it.  We're going to get those rumors started again.  Started again, you know.  Rug.  Yeah, like we all know, stamp licker.  We all heard those rumors, didn't we?  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  Thank God those rumors are dead, right?  Oprah didn't mean to bring that up again.  It's all that.  You said, as I was reading, I just, well, just tell everything, you know. 
[01:06:00]  Have you ever kissed a woman?  No.  Okay.  No, we don't want to start those rumors again.  No, I'm sorry.  I really haven't.  No.  I love it, man.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I want to start those rumors again.  But, you know, your breath does smell like trout.  I don't want to start those rumors again.  Rumors again.  She really nailed it to her, didn't she?  That really was an unintentional crucifixion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If she would have just said, I'd hate to start a rumor, that's one thing, but we wouldn't  want to start those rumors again.  Rumors again. 
[01:06:30]  You know, the ones that were around a few years ago about you being a lesbian.  If you're going to lie to someone, you've got to, like, you've just got to pause before  you answer the question.  Keep it smooth.  Right.  Keep it smooth.  Fall in!  You just don't see that on the professional poker tour.  Just count to 100 in your head before you answer the question.  Take a breath.  Yes.  I don't know.  You can't wait too long, though.  No.  You can't, like, all right, say to me.  Like you're thinking about it?  Say to me, have you ever kissed a guy?  Jimmy, have you ever kissed a guy? 
[01:07:00]  See, that's no good.  You can't.  You can't do that.  It's got to be just a quick.  Yeah.  No, I have not.  You can't.  But you can't also do it.  Okay, ask me.  Anthony, have you ever kissed a guy?  No!  No!  Don't start those rumors again.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  I want to do a little something with this, if you don't mind.  I was reading.  I just, well, just tell everything, you know.  Have you ever kissed a woman?  No.  You're a liar.  I want to start those rumors again. 
[01:07:30]  No.  God damn liar!  No.  No, I believe you.  And if I had, you'd love to.  Say it again.  Say it again.  I told you years ago.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah, I'm sure she is.  Isn't that a little weird?  She hasn't, I'm sure.  That road trip with Gail is legit.  Oh, yeah.  Well, who knows?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hmm.  She's powerful.  We don't know for sure.  Yeah, of course.  We don't know.  One more time.  Just tell everything, you know. 
[01:08:00]  Have you ever kissed a woman?  No.  Okay.  No, we don't start those rumors again.  I'm sorry.  I really haven't.  No.  No, I believe you.  And if I had...  You'd let us know.  I'd let you know.  Yes, you'd let us know.  I told you years ago.  Yes.  Yes.  That answer is...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  False.  Oh!  Oh.  No!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[01:08:30]  She's so open and upfront and honest that she would have said it on her show. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, of course.  That's exactly what she was implying.  I wish something would come out someday and then someone could play this clip.  Remember you said this?  Yeah.  Oh, well, you know, that was my personal life.  Yeah, okay.  That's why I don't really respect Rosie O'Donnell.  She came out after she didn't need the TV show anymore and made all that money.  Yeah.  You know, because she knows it's not good for business to be an open lesbian on a morning talk show when you're talking to housewives. 
[01:09:30]  Hasn't hurt Ella, though.  Huh?  I'll tell you one thing.  Hasn't hurt Ella?  Yeah, that's why I do respect her.  You know, but Rosie waited.  She waited until the show was done and then she's like, all right, I got an announcement.  Why don't you make that announcement during your, you know, the pinnacle of your TV career?  That talk show was huge.  Had everyone thinking that you were in love with Tom Cruise?  Oh, God.  That's, that was nauseating.  Oh, her with that fake, what'd I do to him?  Kick him out and invite in a girl?  Exactly.  Move his face out of the way and say, hold on, Katie, here I am. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  What'd you do to him?  What'd I do to him?  I'd knock him out cold.  And have my way with Katie Holmes.  What'd I do to him?  Well, I'd drop him some roofies.  Get rid of him.  Right.  Have him killed.  Maybe she was being honest.  That's all she really said.  What'd I do to him?  Tom Cruise.  Oh, my Tommy.  My Tommy.  Oh, stop it.  Tammy, maybe.  My Tammy, yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, don't forget, we're hosting a private semi-pro screening today right after the old radio show at the AMC Empire, 234 West 42nd Street here in Manhattan.  I think the screening's going to start right at 11 a.m.  The first 75 people will get to attend the screening and get a free corn dog.  A free corn dog?  What?  Yeah.  They're giving out a free corn?  What, are they trying to break the bank?  Unbelievable, right?  Yeah.  First come, first serve.  Semi-pro starring Will Ferrell putting the funk into the dunk in theaters Friday. 
[01:11:00]  This movie looks like it's going to be good.  And they're allowing us to see it ahead of time.  That's always a good sign.  Usually they hide these screenings from us if the movie's not going to do that well.  Is Will or anybody going to be there?  No.  We got Andre coming in, though.  Andre 3000.  Is he in the movie?  I believe so, yeah.  Will Ferrell was at Radio City Sunday night.  Yeah, we can't get the big stars, you know.  Oh, he might have left town.  Huh?  Who knows?  Maybe he left.  I don't know.  You know, we push, we push, we push these movies for these guys, and then we don't get 
[01:11:30]  the big star.  No.  No respect.  That's all right.  No respect.  We get someone.  We got Andre 3000.  I know.  That's huge.  Outcast, dude.  Yeah.  We'll talk to him in about an hour.  Hey, Black History Month continues just for a couple more days.  We're just about at the end of this bit.  Here's today's honoree.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes.  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the 
[01:12:00]  melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Academy Award-winning actor Louis Gossett, Jr., for his portrayal of grizzled  Air Force Colonel Charles Chappie Sinclair in the 1986 film Iron Eagle.  A bunch of things must have gone wrong if you're listening to this.  Crank up that Walkman and fly high, Iron Eagle.  We know you can't hit the broadside of a barn without blasting your tunes.  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History.  Chappie!  On the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:12:30]  How's everybody doing today?  I want to say good morning to Cleveland.  Hello, Cleveland.  And Cleveland.  Buffalo.  And Boston.  Boston.  And Syracuse.  Celebrating me third wife's demise.  And I guess we could say good morning to Grand Rapids, too.  Eh.  What's...  Don't eh. 
[01:13:00]  Grand Rapids?  My goodness.  Ah, they know we're just goofing, I guess.  Speaking of Cleveland, Jimmy's going to be up there Friday night for a couple shows, right?  Yeah.  He is.  Sold out, by the way.  We're just excited that Jimmy's going to Cleveland.  I also am going to Atlanta, Denver, a bunch of whole cities, Detroit.  Check my MySpace, Jim Norton, and you'll see all my dates.  You're all over the place.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Very psyched actually.  You're what they call a phenomenon.  Not really, no.  I'm just a mediocrity rolling from city to city with three wheels and one falling off. 
[01:13:30]  With your cohort?  Yes.  Ken is there.  Of course.  All of my shows.  All right.  Moving on to other things.  I don't know if America's talking about this, but the Oscars, lowest ratings ever.  Down 14% from the lowest ratings before this.  That's amazing.  So, like, really, really bad.  A really bad showing for the Oscars.  No one cared.  They keep with the cornball stuff.  They're not going to be funny. 
[01:14:00]  They're going to be...  I'm talking about just everyone's so safe.  People are tired of it.  You're competing with cable and the internet now.  Now, nobody wants to see that safe crap.  Yeah.  The networks are just so behind, man.  Also, there weren't a lot of blockbuster movies that were part of the Oscars that were up for awards.  And they said that hurt the Oscars as well.  And Jon Stewart was flat.  And he's a really funny, clever guy.  Jon Stewart has that little title now.  What do you mean?  The lowest rated Oscars ever.  He's the host.  And I mention this because they did a montage during the Oscars where they showed all the past hosts of the Oscars. 
[01:14:30]  And they left Whoopi out.  She hosted four times.  Did she really?  I believe it was four times.  At least it's as a host that I had.  And what's that about?  Like...  She must have pissed somebody off.  But who...  Tough S.  Remember when...  It's still history.  And if you're showing a montage of the history of the Oscars, you've got to include her.  Do you?  Remember when WAAF did a big story about the history of their station? 
[01:15:00]  Ah, well, good point.  And we were completely left out of it like we were never, ever there.  Yeah.  Stupid Dave Douglas.  We brought that station from nowhere into a major station in the Boston area.  It was a Worcester piece of crap station.  And, you know, we gave it some juice.  We got it some respect in the Boston market.  Well, not respect, but we did get them a name. 
[01:15:30]  We got respect as far as other radio stations go.  They had to, like, pay attention to the station for the first time.  And, yeah.  It was FMQB, I think?  Yeah.  They did this big history of their station.  And because Dave Douglas...  Still holding a grudge.  Yeah, and did not even mention us.  Yeah, didn't WNEW do that also?  What do you mean?  They did a whole retrospective on the rock of New York when it was WNEW. 
[01:16:00]  It was the rock of New York.  And when they changed, I guess, over to Blink or whatever the hell they were going to, they did a whole retrospective and never included us.  We're part of, like, Russian history.  We're like Stalin.  If you know anything about Russian history, they just, like, omit stuff that might not be good for the country.  Like, oh, that didn't happen.  Chop it out.  Chop it out.  It went from rock to Blink.  You know what?  F-NEW.  There's a bunch of jocks that think that N-E-W was the S. 
[01:16:30]  It never got good ratings.  They still talk about it like it's the holy land.  We were the most popular show in N-E-W history.  And it kills these old dudes that spun records for 20, 25 straight years.  And they don't even acknowledge that we were successful at that radio station.  When I was growing up, I thought their music sucked.  I thought they were the same corny playlist over and over.  I hated it when I was a teenager.  I thought it was terrible.  Yeah, people thought that this was a legendary station.  I guess it was in a way. 
[01:17:00]  But as far as ratings go, it wasn't anywheres close.  Yeah.  Big deal.  Angela Lansbury's a legend.  I wouldn't want to listen to her either.  The music on this station right now on K-Rock here in New York that they're playing, I like a lot.  Yeah.  I like the rock selection a lot.  Yeah, I turn on one day.  It's like Hendrix, then Guns N' Roses, and then Sabbath.  It's like, all right, that's what I want to listen to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we should play the Carol Miller Clubs.  Oh, God.  It might be the day for the Carol Miller Clubs.  Those were so fringe-inducing.  The Whoopi montage, yeah, let's do Carol Miller.  We're feeling it today.  We haven't done that in a while. 
[01:17:30]  This dope that's still spinning records thinking she's important.  How far back did they go?  Did they show, like, Carson?  From the beginning, yeah.  They did a whole montage of all the hosts that hosted the Oscars, and they just left Whoopi out.  And I didn't even know she did it four times, Jimmy.  And Steve Martin, he was a repeat host.  But how many times did he host?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  But, you know, a bunch of times, obviously.  So, Whoopi on The View yesterday got all choked up.  It takes a lot to choke up Whoopi.  She's pretty, she's a tough broad, man. 
[01:18:00]  She can hang in there with the best of them.  Yeah.  But she was really bummed out that they blew her off in the montage.  I don't.  I don't know.  Why do you think you're a great host?  Yeah.  You'll be a great host.  Just make stuff for it.  We love you.  We love Whoopi.  Well, you know, Pete, being slighted is never fun.  It's not fun.  No, it's fun.  I wouldn't like it.  It's not.  It's not fun.  It makes you ask why.  You know, it just always makes you ask why.  I just can't be of any reason.  Why are you the second black woman to ever win an Oscar, period?  Yes.  That's Hattie McDaniel and then you. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  I mean, you did make history.  So, it would have been nice to.  Right.  Oh.  It's a better visual.  I mean, Whoopi was all choked up and just really bummed out.  Yeah.  She should have been bummed out.  I mean, that's a real slap in the face.  And there's no reason for it.  She hosted it four times.  Who'd she piss off?  Yeah, there's a story that I'd love to know.  That isn't just an omission.  No.  That isn't like an oopsie.  Oh, F Hollywood.  Do we have a copy?  Bunch of pompous asses.  Oh, that montage of all your visual?  I would love to see if they show any black hosts.  Well, who else was? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, Chris Rock.  I'm sure they had Chris Rock in there.  Chris and Whoopi are like the only two black hosts.  Am I wrong?  No, I mean, the story came out that only Whoopi was omitted.  No one else.  So, obviously, it's like, what is this about?  What is going on here?  Her and Steve Martin.  Huh?  Steve Martin was omitted, too, but he only hosted twice.  Steve Martin was omitted?  Still, if he hosted twice, he should have been in there.  I agree.  He was probably hard to work with also.  I'm just saying.  Also, when they did the death montage, I love the death montage. 
[01:19:30]  Death montage.  Because then you've got to see who's a more popular dead person than other dead people.  Makes me laugh every year that people applaud louder for certain dead people than others.  That just amazes me.  We liked this person more.  Yeah, this guy dead is way more popular than this guy.  Than that guy dead.  It's sick every year.  It's hysterical.  Now, I'll tell you, Steve Martin had one of the funniest lines, though.  It was after that death montage.  Yeah.  He said, next, we're going to show you a list of people who you thought were dead but aren't. 
[01:20:00]  That was really funny.  That is good.  But they didn't include that guy from, help me out, from, what was the movie?  Maybe he should have been omitted.  Yeah, maybe.  The guy that OD'd on the heroin.  Heath Ledger?  No.  No, he didn't OD on heroin.  That was the rumor.  That was the other guy.  The other guy from Pupil.  Apt Pupil.  Apt Pupil.  What?  Brad Renfro.  Yeah, there's a lot of controversy because he was not in the death montage. 
[01:20:30]  Really?  Yeah, even in death, not on the list.  Ouch.  As fans of Apt Pupil, no doubt knows on last night's Oscar broadcast, that film star Brad  Renfro was snubbed during the tear-jerky montage of actors who died from February 1st, 2007  to January 31st, 2008.  Heath Ledger, on the other hand, was honored in the final applause-garnering slot.  How about this, you whores?  How about you just show them in alphabetical order?  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:21:00]  How about that?  So it's not making one more popular than the other.  Yeah, you gotta make, uh, you gotta, yeah, you gotta, you gotta end with Stairway to  Heaven, though, even with a death montage.  And he got a huge ovation, was that what happened?  Yeah, you're dead!  Woo!  Yeah!  That's the dead guy we wanted to see!  Yeah, you're dead!  Nice!  We do too many opening dead guy acts before the big headliner.  We relate to you, cause you went out in style unlike a lot of us who should have died a  while ago.  Woo!  You're dead! 
[01:21:30]  Just the worst.  It's not tear-jerking for me, I laugh pretty hard.  That's us.  You gonna get a big applause for some actor, and then some boom guy who was on Gone with  the Wind Dyes, and one person in the back.  Yeah.  Yay!  It's his brother or something.  You got the Carol Miller tapes, or, well, we got all the things we can do today.  We got, uh, we got the, uh, the sex offender busted peeking at Women in Borders, uh, bathroom.  We got a man finding, uh, the Virgin Mary holding, uh, you know. 
[01:22:00]  Holding Jesus.  Wow.  In a pretzel.  In a pretzel.  Yeah.  Lunatic.  I think God is.  Lunatics.  I think God's getting bored with this thing.  Just popping those, uh, Marys and Jesus everywhere.  For some of us, a tasty treat can be a religious experience.  Oh, my God.  They have to do the news like this.  Do they have to try to have clever little quips for everything? 
[01:22:30]  A little cute tie-in?  Little tie-ins.  Oh, enough.  The news.  Hold on a minute.  Arizona's very mad at us right now.  Why am I?  Grant in Arizona, what's up?  Hey, I'm not really mad.  I love the show.  Yeah.  But, uh, but you never acknowledge Tucson.  Hey, look.  I'm your only listener.  Hey, Tuxin.  Listen.  I love Tuxin.  I've been there.  Yeah.  What do you want us to do?  I love mispronouncing the name of cities.  Tuxin. 
[01:23:00]  What do you want us to do?  Say hi to all the meth heads?  What do you want from me?  What's going on in Tucson?  That's pretty much what it is out here.  It's nothing but meth heads.  You're listening to this show in the middle of the night.  You drive through.  You just have this smell of cat urine.  That's what it smells like when they're cooking up meth.  We're live, right?  So what time is it now in Tucson?  Oh, it is 5.50.  Oof.  5.50?  And what's even worse is they simulcast it.  So you guys only are on from 4 to 6.  Then I get to listen to the last hour of your show the next day. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, God.  Tuxin.  All right.  Well, we ought to.  I get it.  That ought to be a ratings grant.  Yeah.  I get it.  You don't like the show in Tucson.  How can you make it any more clearer?  That's correct.  We used to be, like, in a nice slot, and then they moved us to the middle of the night.  I thought at least they had the full show in the middle of the night.  But no.  You get two hours.  They've dissected it and sewn it back together.  And then the next day you get the hour you missed?  Yeah, the first hour of the show today I got to listen to you guys talking about Anthony 
[01:24:00]  and his Playboy Mansion idea from the day before.  That was today we talked about that.  Well, we went back to it, but.  Yeah, you went back to it.  Wow.  We get it.  You don't like the show.  We'll find cities that like the show.  We have no problem with that.  God.  Thanks, Grant.  Hey, take it easy.  All right.  Bye, Grant.  So here's Jesus and the pretzel.  Yeah, with the cute little news banter.  For some of us, a tasty treat can be a religious experience. 
[01:24:30]  And one man may have found his miracle in a rolled gold bag.  A pretzel resembling the Virgin Mary cradling baby Jesus has been posted on eBay for only two days,  and the bidding is already up to $1,000.  That fine may just be cause for a hallelujah.  Oh, yeah.  And that's why we don't really vote for the president of the United States of America.  They can't trust people that see Jesus and Mary. 
[01:25:00]  Pretzels and want to pay $1,000 for it.  Why would she have to go with hallelujah?  She could have said, good thing they weren't nuggets that fall through the holes of his hand.  I don't know who's worse, the people that buy into this crap or the news for the way they report it.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian, what's up? 
[01:25:30]  Brian!  What?  Did you just say hi to yourself because you're nervous?  Yes, I did.  No, he said Brian.  Hold on.  Is it Ryan?  Are you crying?  Brian.  What is it?  Brian.  Anyway, don't sell yourself short in Grand Rapids.  You guys are the bomb.  That all swore there.  Thank you.  Well, listen, we got free beer and hot wings show here.  All they do is trivia and name that too, and it's horrible.  Yeah, I'd have to do that.  I guess we're going to have to start acknowledging Grand Rapids, 
[01:26:00]  but we've got to teach you a little bit about sarcasm so you can understand what the hell is going on.  Let's go to Chris in Cleveland.  Chris?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hello.  Whoopi Goldberg, the art of the mentionless, linger longer.  Hey, why don't we, thank you, sir, why don't we move on to the next story?  Sex offender busted peeking at women in Borders' bathroom.  This guy is a classic.  This guy is a classic.  And then what he did besides that is just an interesting thing. 
[01:26:30]  Let's start with this, though.  38-year-old David Flavel of Brockton is a registered level three sex offender accused of sneaking into the ladies' restroom at the Borders bookstore in Braintree back on January 29th.  He confessed to the crimes and was apologetic.  He indicated that he followed this woman into the bathroom because she was attractive.  He said that his intent was not to rape her but just to look at her.  The 36-year-old woman from Holbrook positively identified Flavel from photos posted on Massachusetts' most wanted list. 
[01:27:00]  And last night he was arrested in a donut shop in Brockton carrying the same backpack he had at Borders three weeks ago.  Inside the backpack was a black ski mask, duct tape, and three pairs of work gloves.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Whoa.  That ain't good.  Red flag, red flag.  Maybe he does construction in the cold.  Yes, that could be it.  A bit of a red flag.  Yeah, if you're a nut like this and are carrying duct tape, it's over. 
[01:27:30]  Someone's getting duct taped.  Can we go ahead, Jim?  No, he was going to assault somebody in one of those bathrooms.  Absolutely.  Can we buy the pretzel and make a YouTube video of us smashing the pretzel or eating the pretzel?  Who's going to eat it?  You eat it.  I don't want to burn in hell.  I'll eat it.  You take your chances.  We got more on this guy.  Yeah, listen to this.  He's also under investigation by Boston's Crimes Against Children unit. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, boy.  We're making obscene phone calls to a child at risk hotline in Connecticut where he calls the  hotline and makes comments detailing sexual acts he's committed in graphic detail.  Hopefully it is him.  One less person off the street.  Oh, the man on the street interview, Jimmy.  Ah, good.  These people give us some insight into the story on a local angle.  Yeah.  Committed in graphic detail.  Hopefully it is him.  One less person off the street to be bothering us. 
[01:28:30]  Obviously.  See, that's an interesting point that she made because my take would have been, well, I hope  that this guy doesn't go to jail because he didn't get to commit the rape he wanted to.  Yeah.  See, that was a good point she made.  Yeah.  Just amazing.  Really adding to the story.  Thank you for that.  Obviously, the employees at the Borders bookshop are very, very relieved that Flavel is behind  bars here at the courthouse.  He is going to be transferred to prison. 
[01:29:00]  He's being held on $10,000 cash bail.  Again, a man with a very, very long history of sexual offenses.  Offenses.  10 G's.  Put a bullet to his head.  That's it.  Yeah.  Bullet to the head.  Why is it $10,000 bail?  And then you get somebody that's, you know, selling some weed and it's without bail or half  a million dollars or something.  How does a ghoul like that get out on 10 grand bail?  I don't know.  Let's go to Charlie here in New York City. 
[01:29:30]  Charlie, what's up?  Charlie.  Maybe he was looking for his wedding ring.  Linger longer.  The wedding ring story is one of my favorite of all time, by the way.  One of these days when we take a vacation or something, we got to play our favorite news  stories of all time.  Yeah, that was a good one.  You got the horse guy in Seattle.  That could be a number one.  That could be up there.  But what about the guy in the outhouse?  Yeah.  That was putting himself. 
[01:30:00]  A lot of people have seen these outhouses.  You're doing drive-by nature.  You got to take a little, you know, relief.  And you go into this outhouse and it's just a hole in the ground that drops down, what,  four or five feet?  And it's just a muddy, just, it's just a mess.  Yeah, disgusting.  Well, a guy came up with a wonderful scheme to hide down in that so he can look at girls  as they're doing their thing.  And he finally got caught because the girl, for some reason, looked, well, no, I think  we all kind of look after we're done, right?  Sure.  So she looks and just kind of sees, like, eyes, like, kind of popping out of the brownness. 
[01:30:30]  He must have just been covered.  You don't remember this story, Jimmy?  Yes, I do, but that's awful.  He must have been covered.  And his excuse was that he dropped his wedding ring.  Yeah, so he had to crawl in there.  And try to find it.  You got to do that.  If you're married and you drop your wife in there, you don't go in after her, never  mind the wedding ring.  Right.  There is no way I would chase after anything once it falls in there. 
[01:31:00]  Of course not.  So he obviously wasn't doing that.  He was submerged in there, peeking up when ladies would sit there doing their business.  I'm watching CW11, and they're showing Bernadette Peters with some animals.  Yeah.  And this is what they put for her.  Bernadette Peters, actress slash animal advocate.  And it's like, no, you're an actress.  The animal advocate is your personal business.  That's not how we should identify you.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, actress slash eats healthy.  Who cares? 
[01:31:30]  Well.  Oh, my.  Isn't irritating.  Yeah.  Andrea has more to the story that we just had of the guy at Borders.  Andrea listening on BCN.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to add a little bit more to that.  The guy was lingering there for about two hours and pretending to be on the pay phone,  watching women go in and out, kind of scouting out this particular person that he wanted,  and then move the magazine rack in front of the exit so that she couldn't get out.  I think it was a little bit more than just keeping.  Oh, so he was going to, yeah, get in there and use his duct tape? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  I think the whole thing.  Backpack, duct tape.  Oh, yeah.  He was up to no good.  This is not an innocent guy whatsoever.  He should just be shot in the back of the head.  I agree.  So, thank you, Andrea.  Have a good day.  I remember a gym I used to work at, work out at.  Um, I don't go there anymore.  Um, is this wrong?  They used to have like a, like a, like a board, like a, like a, like a, like a message board, 
[01:32:30]  like a, uh.  A little cork bulletin board.  A little bulletin board.  And they would tell you about the yoga classes and the, uh.  Sure.  The spinning classes.  And you could do a little tie bow.  Tie bow.  Great.  And I, uh, looked like I was really into like doing some of these classes because I  would be over there all the time just studying when I was going to take my next yoga class. 
[01:33:00]  But I, uh, discovered, and I think I was pretty much the only one because I, I would even watch  the bulletin board as I was, as I was working out and saw that no one else discovered what  I discovered.  And that is if you look straight at the bulletin board and study the yoga classes, but you look  just off to the left.  Yeah.  It goes, it gives you a nice view into the, uh, the women's locker room.  Oh.  But you don't see, what you do see is a mirror that now bounces to where they're, where they're 
[01:33:30]  changing.  Very strategic.  And I'm watching these, uh, women that I've seen walk around this town, small town, completely  naked.  Wow.  Completely.  So in between sets, this was my thing to go to the bulletin board and study the, the,  the yoga, the yoga classes.  Bring a camera with you.  Start snapping pictures.  Yes.  I got this yoga schedule.  Yes.  I, I'm going to take this class.  And I'm amazed that no one discovered this. 
[01:34:00]  Now, of course, most guys are, are not going to be the ones running to the front desk.  Excuse me.  Found a flaw at your gym.  You know, there's ladies in there and I could see them in the mirror and you better solve  that problem.  But I'm wondering, not one woman looking at the bulletin board, didn't notice what I  did.  If you just, you don't have to.  Looking in the mirror, doesn't see you looking out of the corner of your eyes.  Right, but you don't have to even strain.  It was pretty much a nice, perfect angle. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  You just look off to the left slightly.  Wow.  And that went on the entire time I was working out at that particular gym.  I couldn't believe it.  Just bring some free weights over there.  Right.  Working out in front of the bulletin board.  Having a little backpack with a mask and gloves.  Gloves and duct tape.  Can we all agree that we all are voyeuristic in nature?  People love voyeurism.  Can we all agree that, to that point?  People love to be voyeurs.  When does it become perverted? 
[01:35:00]  Seriously, when does it become perverted?  When it becomes a true invasion of someone's privacy.  Like, we see this girl get dressed every morning.  We gave up on her because she's a mess.  But it was fun for a while.  But she was naked once again this morning, right outside our window.  Yeah, it's her windows are open, her blinds.  All these windows are open.  It's her prerogative to open up the blinds.  But if we sent somebody out there to open her blinds while she was naked, that's a different story. 
[01:35:30]  Well, most people in New York just don't have blinds.  I mean, there's a lot of perverts in this city because there's so many people that just change in front of windows all the time.  And there's people you don't want to look at.  Going back to N.E.W., remember that row of windows?  Yeah.  Women just showering one after another all the way down the row of this building?  Yeah, it was all bathroom windows.  And we just watch.  We did an afternoon drive, so it was women coming home.  And once in a while, you throw in the guy. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  It's part of the whole thing, I guess.  And what?  They still do freshers, female jocks.  Oh, the female jocks still watch?  Huh?  Yeah, I've been over there.  That row of windows and the female jocks are fresh now when they're not on the air.  They're watching these ladies come back from the gym, shower.  I miss that row of windows every day.  It was a new treat.  And we had the perfect time because it was women coming home from work and getting ready to go out to happy hour or something. 
[01:36:30]  So they're getting a quick shower in for the night's activities.  Without fail, every day.  And they had no clue that.  We're just sitting there watching them.  Yeah, I know.  We got to do that.  That does make sense, though, that they would sit there and now fawn over guys.  If I was one of the guys in there, oh, man, what a show.  Yeah?  What a show.  They would just get the crank show.  If they're going to be looking, why not? 
[01:37:00]  Just every day.  It's like, here he is again.  And when does it become perverted when you're, like, you're voyeuristic?  It goes more than just looking where you shouldn't look.  It's like if you're violating someone.  Like, if you're doing, it's common sense kind of dictates.  If you just look at a window across the thing, that's pretty normal.  I think it is, too.  But especially if they don't have shades or blinds and they're openly naked, they got to think someone's looking at them, right?  Yeah, but if you're skulking in the bushes and then you're peeking up through the window. 
[01:37:30]  You're up in a tree or you're trying to find the ladder.  Yeah.  Yeah, then there's a problem.  Yeah, like that Moxley girl.  I was thinking more Animal House with Belushi on the ladder.  At the golf club.  Peeping Tom.  Yeah, if you're becoming a peeping Tom.  What's this?  What did you find?  There was a guy a couple weeks ago who emailed us some photos of this girl in a condo next to his office.  And everybody in the building just takes photos of her every day. 
[01:38:00]  She so knows she's naked.  She knows.  And she's beautiful.  Can we get those up on our website?  Really?  No.  Where exactly?  That's illegal.  Where is this?  It's somewhere on Long Island.  Are you kidding?  She so knows she's just naked and she's making believe she's on the phone and she's kind of posing.  Wow.  Wow.  Stashing herself.  She has big floor-to-ceiling windows, too.  She looks like Jennifer Aniston.  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  Oh, that's so hot.  See, I think she's into that, obviously. 
[01:38:30]  Come on.  She knows.  Of course she does.  She's completely naked, huh?  But you do actually lose a sense of caring.  Because I honestly, I have Opsie in my apartment.  I kind of have surround windows and they're floor-to-ceiling.  And I literally will almost just walk naked and not care who's looking.  It's like, what are you going to see?  Me?  Good for you.  It's uneventful.  They'll start snapping pictures.  They'll end up in the tabloids.  I've actually duck-walked out to get toilet paper.  Honest to God, I don't care.  Duck-walked. 
[01:39:00]  I literally have.  Oh, God.  You know, with the little pants around the ankles, here's the jiggle of the belt because  it's hitting the floor.  Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  What is she doing in the window?  She's doing weird exercises.  Her bed is right next to the window.  Of course it is.  Because looking at this shot, she could easily have the bed over there behind the air conditioner  and no one would ever see her naked.  But she has to be on that part of the window.  Yeah.  And she's looking out the window.  Yeah.  More of those pictures?  All right.  We've got to take a break, unfortunately. 
[01:39:30]  Just a bit of a tease.  We'll look at more of these pictures as we go to break.  Opie and Anthony.  Go.  Andre 3000.  We'll be on the show in about 10, 15 minutes.  From Semi Pro.  We've got lots to do still.  We've got two teachers busted doing the sex thing with the kids.  We've got the woman that died on the plane.  That was a big story yesterday.  Yeah.  I guess the family's a little angry.  You know.  We've got the famous Carol Miller tapes. 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  Some of this stuff we'll just have to do tomorrow.  We also have guys that want to talk about being voyeuristic.  Why don't we start there?  Let's say hi to Dane from Boston.  Dane, what's going on?  Well, where are you, Dane?  Hey.  I'm here.  There you go.  Yeah, what's up?  It's actually Dana, but I figured I'd rather have you three guys make fun of me than your screener.  Yeah.  Hey, Dana.  Girl's name.  Girl's name, guy. 
[01:40:30]  Pray for me.  Yeah.  Dana.  I'm here.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  Let's go.  What's up?  All right.  So I went to the University of Georgia.  Congratulations.  Anything else?  Wonderful.  Your parents were rich.  Congratulations.  I went to a state school.  Rub it in.  I went to Middlesex Community.  Yeah.  I got a B and three Fs in the one semester I learned.  And I dropped out of high school, so my credits were supposed to transfer.  They were supposed to be credits that worked for high school and community college. 
[01:41:00]  Nice.  You know, like retort credits.  Those are retort credits.  I took biology, F, Western Civilization, F, Problems and Statistics, F, English, a merciful  bee.  Nice.  I was getting sober, so I used that to manipulate my professor who was just being kind.  God, I'm sorry.  You were writing poems to your professor or something?  Almost that pathetic.  Yeah.  I wanted to take my college schooling seriously.  Got into Geneseo State University.  I was very excited.  And then Playboy came out with their top drinking schools in America. 
[01:41:30]  And sure, Geneseo is right there.  Made it.  I was like, all right, well, I guess I'm not going to be going here to actually learn anything.  What do you got, Dana?  So back in my stupid state school, I was in a stupid fraternity.  And the pledge class before me, we had to do like a little project for house improvement.  And they decided to build a recycle bin.  And they, for some reason, built it underneath the window of the girls' bathroom.  But during band parties, we could get drunk and take turns standing outside the bin, like 
[01:42:00]  standing on the bin like a bunch of creeps, checking out uppity sorority girls going to  the bathroom.  Now, what's funny about that is the house was an old piece of crap house, so we raised  money over the couple of years that I was in school.  And we had an architect come in and design a new house, which we subsequently have built.  But it's funny, during one of the chapter meetings of the last, one of the last weeks  in the old house, and one of the brothers raised their hand and asked if the architect 
[01:42:30]  had designed a new voyeur bathroom in the new house.  He was doing so well.  So your story just stopped.  I know, man.  How do you make, like, naked sorority girls sound boring?  The big, like, the big peak there was the whole thing about how you originally had it,  and then the whole new construction thing really lost.  Yeah.  Yeah, you lost your flow there.  Yeah, we were looking at naked girls, but then we moved out, and who knew?  The truck was late, and we hit a lot of traffic.  The architect gave the plans to his son, and he lost it on his bicycle, and he died of AIDS. 
[01:43:00]  Graduation day came, and, well, that was the end of that.  Great, thanks.  All right, well, I saw, hey, Jimmy, when are you going to be in Boston?  It'll be a while, sir.  I was up in that area recently, but you just hold on to your hat.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, let's go down, well, not go down, let's go over there.  Brian, California, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I drive an 18-wheeler locally, and I pull up to a stoplight every morning, 
[01:43:30]  and this is a women's aerobic spot, and every morning, just normal girls are doing their thing,  and, of course, I've got a good three minutes to spend checking them out.  Well, somebody wisened up and put paper over the window so no guys couldn't look anymore,  but since I'm up in the truck, I can see right down in them, and I just enjoy it every morning.  All right, there you go.  I love that.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, thank you, sir.  Hey, sir, you got the woman dying on the plane.  Yeah, and now I guess it was American Airlines.  Yep. 
[01:44:00]  They were saying everything worked fine.  The oxygen tanks worked.  The flight attendants knew what they were doing, administered help to the woman, but she died  anyway.  She needed the oxygen?  Yeah.  For what reason?  Uh, she had heart complications and diabetes.  Oh, boy.  She had the diabetes.  You didn't say, uh, diabetes, did you?  I said diabetes.  You really didn't say diabetes.  I'm Wilford Brimley.  Yeah.  And I get my diabetes supplies from Liberty. 
[01:44:30]  You didn't say diabetes.  Because if you have...  No, I didn't say diabetes.  What'd you say?  I said diabetes.  Oh, diabetes.  The way you're supposed to say it, like Wilford Brimley says it, diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes testing supplies.  From Liberty.  From Liberty.  Here's the story.  Old curmudgeon.  Well, this is, in fact, a terrible story. 
[01:45:00]  A woman has difficulty breathing on a flight out of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to New York.  Twice her family says she is denied oxygen before being given a tank that they say was empty.  Don't let me die.  Don't let me die.  Were Corrine Desir's final words before she finally did die.  An American Airlines strike 896 out of Port-au-Prince.  Her grieving cousin, Antonio Oliver.  Who spoke to us at his Brooklyn home this evening.  Was on the flight with her.  He tells a harrowing tale. 
[01:45:30]  His cousin, he said, was having difficulty breathing twice.  They were denied oxygen before the tragic final act.  Oh, wow.  Tragic final act?  Is it a play?  What is he talking about?  Now, Oliver says there were two doctors and two nurses who happened to be on the flight.  They tried to help, but they could not, he says, because that oxygen tank was empty.  His cousin, he says, died in his arms.  Her body was transported on the flight here to JFK. 
[01:46:00]  Now, we do have a spokesman from an American Airlines statement from an American Airlines spokesman.  Does she just come popping out of the baggage thing?  Oh, God.  Like, how do they do that?  Oh, that would be horrible.  The family's crying as thud.  You have to look outside the plane window and see her being offloaded, roughly.  Samsonite thrown on her.  Still in the sitting position.  That's terrible.  Is that our body? 
[01:46:30]  Check the tag.  Well, they accidentally forwarded her to the wrong airport.  Look, we have bad news for you.  Good news is she'll still be dead.  Bad news is we routed her through Boston.  Now you're going to have to wait at the airport for an extra couple hours.  A statement from an American Airlines spokesman who told us, quote, our flight attendants are professionals and they are trained in assisting passengers in medical emergencies.  I have no doubt they did everything in their power to help this passenger. 
[01:47:00]  But, in fact, there was a tragic result here.  There are more questions than answers this evening.  This is a story that requires further investigation.  Yeah, well, it sucks to be her.  Yeah, but they did promise to give her some, like, those American Airlines dollars to her family so they can have, like, free drinks and headphones next time they go to the Port-au-Prince.  So, I don't know what the hell is going to come of that. 
[01:47:30]  They said there was oxygen in the tanks and it should have been fine.  I don't know.  I believe the family more than the airline because the airline was like, well, we have faith that they did everything that, you know, you weren't there.  Yeah.  No one says, don't let me die if they don't give you oxygen twice.  Right.  No one makes that up.  We asked for oxygen twice and they said no.  Really?  No.  I just made that up.  What were they going to say?  Hold on.  I got to get the movie started.  Why would they say no?  That's like an odd thing.  Of course they would say no. 
[01:48:00]  Let's say hi to Mark.  He's in Miami.  Mark?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I repo cars for a living, man, and I'm constantly running across, you know, voyeuristic situations.  Probably the best one, I was in an apartment complex taking a car and I look down as I'm trying to get it out of the parking spot and there's a couple going at it in the car next to me.  And they see me and get more excited than I see them.  And so I stood there and enjoyed the show for a while.  Let's just say by the time they were done, I was pitching a tent. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  Let's just say it then.  Watch that fresh talk.  Yeah.  I'm constantly walking into situations like that.  Are you?  I walked into people's backyards and, you know, found people.  What Iraq is to death, this guy is to sex, apparently.  Try to explain that one, what you're doing back there.  Yeah.  That's awesome, Mark.  That's a lot of fun.  All right.  Just awesome.  That's totally it.  I got pitted. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Two teachers being just dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty.  You got a female teacher and you got a male teacher.  Which one do you want to hear first?  It could be a trick question.  We hear the male and see the female.  All right.  Male teacher first.  All right.  They might both be female.  Now, I'm not sure.  Two teachers in the news.  A former middle school math teacher in Queens is facing sex charges. 
[01:49:30]  Bradley Deipenbacher of Levittown, Long Island is accused of sending sexually explicit instant  messages to eight male students.  Prosecutors say he also asked the 12 and 13 year old boys to use web cameras during sex  actions.  Deipenbacher resigned from the 14th middle school on February 14th.  He faces 15 years behind bars if he is convicted.  Anthony, I got a question for you.  Yes.  I usually ask Jimmy the question.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You think this guy got fired?  Uh, this guy not only got fired. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  He got so fired.  So fired.  So fired.  So completely, totally fired.  Would it be discreet, buddy?  You would have to fire him, hire him back, and fire him again.  Just to make sure.  Immediately after.  Just to make sure he gets the point.  That he is fired.  Webcams, I am.  Oh, just couldn't.  He couldn't take it.  Needed the young boys. 
[01:50:30]  Please cam up, oh dear.  Cam up.  Hello, dear boy.  Please call yourself William.  William, oh dear.  Do you have a webcam, my dear boy?  Yes, oh dear.  Hurry up, fatso.  The piss almost all over.  Look at him, look at him.  I've seen donkey hooves be more graceful.  On buttons than you are right now.  He's losing his mind.  Hurry up, fatso.  There you go.  He's trying to find it.  All right.  Oh dear. 
[01:51:00]  Okay, young boy.  Could you please send me webcam pictures?  Woo!  Don't call the police.  I won't last in prison.  Oh, look at that one.  So tender.  Oh dear.  Look, it looks like a little clamshell.  You know what part I'm talking about?  I can't say it here.  On FM radio.  Woo!  Woo!  Thanks for the music when I had material, E-Rock.  Ugh.  E-Rock.  I could see his hands shaking from here. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, I know.  And he was nervously fumbling through all the little papers.  I need to watch it.  You know what?  I'm the question man today.  I got a question for E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock, eventually you're going to move into the future.  And you're going to be a different E-Rock.  What would you do to this E-Rock if you could go back in time?  Back in time.  Yeah.  You're seeing this E-Rock.  You're now future E-Rock.  You're seeing the incompetent E-Rock that is the current you.  But I have hope for you.  I think you're becoming a different E-Rock in the future. 
[01:52:00]  What would you do to this E-Rock?  Oh, I would so beat the crap out of this one.  Oh, would you?  Yeah.  You know what I would do?  I'd give me the sports almanac so I could make bets and make a...  I hear someone...  I hear a Back to the Future guy laugh.  Okay, good.  Don't ask him to find Back to the Future music.  Are you crazy?  Oh!  He gets that real quick.  Hey, look at me.  What happened?  Future E-Rock here? 
[01:52:30]  No, it just happened to me next to the Lost in Space music.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's an hour and a half later.  All right, well.  Yeah.  E-Rock said he would kick...  Well, that's wonderful.  But to be creative, you've got to come up with a clever way of how you would beat him up, though, E-Rock.  That's the bit.  Yeah, see?  You show up.  Like, shove cake down his throat until he chokes to death.  You know, stuff like that.  I think I'd break his jaw.  Break his jaw so he can't eat anymore?  Yeah.  Why am I trying to improv with you? 
[01:53:00]  Here's another teacher story.  Well, Long Island teacher's aide is under arrest, accused of having sex with one of her students.  Police caught 39-year-old Maria Cummins with a 15-year-old boy.  You know what's great about this?  All of a sudden, it's got hot.  It's got hot.  Everything.  The first story, creepy as all hell, right?  Creep.  Right.  Male teacher, male student's really creepy.  You've got the female teacher hitting on the male students. 
[01:53:30]  Every guy in America has that freaking fantasy from the old days.  Well, Long Island teacher's aide is under arrest, accused of having sex with one of her students.  Police caught 39-year-old Maria Cummins with a 15-year-old boy Friday at a hotel in Riverhead.  Now, authorities were tipped off by a private investigator hired by her husband.  Police say Cummins admitted buying the boy beer and then having sex with him.  Oh.  Then having sex with him. 
[01:54:00]  That's pretty hot.  39-15.  Yep.  15-year-old.  If you're 15 and you're getting that, you're going for it and you're not going to be damaged.  The husband got the private eye on the case there?  A PI.  Wow.  Well, so he knew something was going on.  Yeah, panties smelled like bubble gum.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We can do more on that, but we've got Andre, who doesn't want to be called 3000, coming in next.  Andre Benjamin from SemiPro will be on the radio next with us. 
[01:54:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show in studio.  Andre Benjamin.  We've been promoting Andre 3000.  Then someone comes in, hey, man, he doesn't go by that anymore.  So I apologize.  That's totally natural.  Hello?  Yeah, you're on.  Oh, yeah, that's totally natural.  I go by whatever you call me.  All right, very cool.  Because then we felt bad because we had a promo running.  We had this excitement and then we're like, oh.  Oh, no, no, I'm not that picky about it.  All right, cool.  Whatever you call me, I'm great with it.  You a morning guy or does this suck for you?  It depends on what happens the night before. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  So I'm pretty good today.  Yeah.  Still going out and partying?  Not really.  You know, it's a lot of work.  You know, we're promoting the SemiPro.  So, you know, you kind of got to go to sleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stupid responsibility.  Does it go in order?  I can't do it.  I just can't do it.  Does it go in order of Famous who has to get up the earliest?  Like, Will probably doesn't have to do anything before noon.  So, like, don't they go, like, further down the line?  Like, you got to get up at 7 and do the promo?  Nah, nah.  We all have to be up at the same time, you know.  What time are you up, Jim? 
[01:55:30]  He's probably...  I don't get to go to bed.  Yeah, I think him and Woody are up doing something else.  You know, kind of spread out the love so we can get the big net, hopefully.  Well, the movie looks really, really good.  We're going to go see it today.  Well, thank you, man.  Appreciate it.  We're seeing it today right after the radio show.  We got, like, a special screening for us.  Oh, that's cool.  And some of our fans and stuff.  But, yeah, the concept looks great.  The commercials and the trailer just look hilarious.  We had a really good time shooting, and I tell you that.  What is the premise of the movie for the people that, at this point, are waking up from comas? 
[01:56:00]  Well, if you don't know anything about the ABA...  Well, first of all, it takes place in the 70s.  Right.  And the basketball league was the ABA, the American Basketball Association.  This was...  It happened around the same time, the NBA.  You know, they were kind of like the stepchild.  With the red, white, and blue ball.  The red, white, and blue ball, which was a little bit smaller.  People don't know it.  It was a little smaller.  Oh, it was?  And, you know, this was the exciting league.  You know, they invented, you know, three-point shot.  There was no three-point shot before the ABA. 
[01:56:30]  Slam dunking and all this kind of stuff came along with the ABA.  But the movie takes place, you know, in Flint, Michigan.  You know, we're this fictitious ABA team called the Flint Tropics.  And I play this kind of high-flying, kind of Dr. J-ish type character.  And we're on this kind of bad news team.  And Will is the promoter.  He's the coach.  You know, he's a player.  And back in those times, and it's true, you know, they would do anything to get people in the stands.  So they would wrestle, you know, wrestle bears. 
[01:57:00]  You know, they would, you know, say if we hit these many shots, everybody in the stands gets corn dogs.  All this kind of stuff.  So we're trying to mirror that.  It was like going to a minor league baseball game.  But this was like, it really was the pros.  I went to see the New Jersey, the New York Nets when Julius Erving was the star in the ABA.  Yeah, actually, I talked to Dr. J Julius Erving before we shot the movie, you know, just kind of get this little input on what it was like to be back in that time.  Did you have to go with the Afro?  I know Will Farrell had to do the Afro. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, mine was a wig.  Will, he grew his out.  You didn't want to commit totally.  I couldn't.  I couldn't.  I didn't have enough time, to be honest.  We have one of our guys growing an Afro.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing Afro Wars with another radio show.  Is it Goof?  I don't know where he is right now.  Where is he?  He's growing out the Afro.  So, he would have fit in.  See, look.  And it's not even for semi-pro.  It's just for our show.  That's cool.  This guy usually has it really tight, but he's been, this guy, Sam.  That's cool.  He's been growing for like three, four months.  I mean, you get it long enough, you can look like Lion-O. 
[01:58:00]  He has his Thundercat shirt on.  Yeah.  He's all right.  Lion-O.  Yeah.  That's working out for him.  You actually won an Emmy for your animated show?  Yeah, yeah.  The soundtrack, the music.  I was happy, you know.  I'm sad, you know, that the show is not on anymore.  They cut it after two seasons, you know.  At least you got two.  I was on one that got one, so.  Yeah.  It's nice.  I mean, but it's sad because the kids and the parents, you know, they ask about it all 
[01:58:30]  the time.  And it was just kind of regime changes at Cartoon Network.  You know, they're trying to figure out, you know, what's their place in the market right  now.  Of course, you know, they have Adult Swim and kids cartoons, and so parents are kind  of confused of what to let their kids watch, you know.  Yeah, they sit their kid down in front of one of the cartoons that are on at night.  Yeah.  So, you know, I kind of got sucked in the whole thing.  But, you know, maybe we'll find a home for it.  You know, it's still alive.  We're actually about to put it on stage, so you'll see Class 3000 on stage, so check 
[01:59:00]  it out.  Are you still, is Outkast still together?  Are you guys still work together, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, still work together.  The next projects, though, they're going to be solo albums, not like Speaker Box Love  Below, where they were sold together.  These are separate products.  Big Boy, I think he's coming out in the summertime, and I just started working on an album that  should be out this fall.  Well, you're a lot more recognizable, and that's not to knock him.  It's kind of like, is this going to turn into like a Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff thing, where  like Will goes on to become like a massive star?  No, not at all, not at all, because Big Boy in his own light, man, he is ferocious, you 
[01:59:30]  know?  Yeah.  And, I mean, he can hold his, actually he's, I must say it, he's probably like one of the  better rappers, you know, going on right now, you know?  So, and film career is going really well.  He just did Who's Your Caddy?  So, I mean, it's, you know, we just, I mean, we grew up together in high school, you  know, so, you know, we're kind of equally like, you know, we're doing the same things  basically.  You got the, yeah, the music thing and acting, what was really first, I guess, OutKast? 
[02:00:00]  To be honest, drawing paint, I thought I was going to be an artist, and then me and Big  Boy met in high school, and we started this group.  Before I met Big Boy, I was actually acting in school, doing stage plays and stuff like  that, so it's kind of like everything was before the music, but I've, you know, gotten  fame, you know, what paid the bills was OutKast, you know?  Yeah, but then after that, I guess you were approached to do movies and...  Yeah, yeah, you know, it's kind of, we're in that time now where if you have a little 
[02:00:30]  record out, they want to put you in a movie now.  So, I just tried to take advantage of that, and, you know, tried to take it seriously,  and, you know, not try to just, you know, take these, you know, jobs where they kind  of just throw you in these things and make you be you, you know?  I don't know why it's like, like, you take musicians that are white guys and put them  in movies and they stink.  But black guys can be put in a movie if they're, you know, rappers or musicians, and they just 
[02:01:00]  kick ass.  I don't know what it is.  You ever see Bon Jovi in a movie?  It sucks ass.  It's horrible.  I never thought, I never thought about it.  Yeah, but Johnny Cash on Columbo is unequal.  I've never seen it.  You know, you know, I never thought about that.  I don't know.  I mean, I think with the studios, studios are like, we just want to get people in seats.  So, basically, you know, a lot of, you know, rappers seem to be able to act.  Well, a lot of rappers act on their records.  So, you know.  You know, obviously, one of the things you're known for, too, besides the music, is like, 
[02:01:30]  you're really a fashionable guy.  Like, you always, always have some kind of a very original outfit or a very original  look going.  And, I mean, not that I don't.  You're dressed like a soccer mom with stupid white sneakers and a sweatshirt like a fat  lady.  And, uh, do you pick your own clothes?  I know that's like a really, that's like a real view question to ask another man, but  it's like, I mean, I wanted to ask you.  No, no.  I mean, it's legit.  It's not, especially in this day and age, man.  Everybody got a personal trainer and somebody to shop for them. 
[02:02:00]  I mean, nah, I pick my own clothes.  To me, I think that's what personal style is all about.  I mean, like, if I pay somebody to dress me, you know, that's not my style, really, you  know.  So, I mean, actually, I love it.  I have fun going shopping.  You know, to me, that's one of my enjoyments in life.  You know, I can go pick out this and this is for me.  You know, I'm, believe it or not, I'm not a fashionable person.  I don't know all the new designers and all that kind of stuff.  I just know what I like.  And I'm actually, this is what I'm wearing now is my clothing company. 
[02:02:30]  I know it sounds crazy because everybody and their mom has a clothing company now, but  I've been, you know, loving clothes for a long, long, long, long time and just find  enjoyment and putting together, putting, you know, things together and design is like,  you know, it's art to me, so.  It's a nice outfit.  It's like, it looks like a leather jacket.  Yeah.  And like a corduroy vest under it with a tie and like a hat.  It's kind of like an old school vibe, like a 20s or 30s vibe, but it's nice.  Well, the first season, which will be in stores in Barney's this fall, the name of the brand 
[02:03:00]  is called Benjamin Bixby.  Yeah.  And it was inspired by, I have all these old pictures and kind of these clips of early  American 1910 to 1935 American football, college football.  And that was the inspiration.  So you're right on it.  He looks really good.  Jimmy hitting that one on the head.  It looks really good, but it looks like too much work.  Too much work?  Yeah, too much work.  Well, that means I did a bad job.  No, no, no.  He means you're putting a tie on and a shirt.  Like a shirt, a tie, then a vest, then the leather jacket, making sure it all matches. 
[02:03:30]  Let me wake up at 4.15 and I'm out the door at 4.30.  It's pretty much it.  I'm lucky to find an iron, you know, a shirt I could iron quickly if I'm going out.  It must be nice.  It really didn't take that much time.  It was a compliment, by the way.  I'm just saying.  I have my own clothing company, too.  It's where you wear corduroys that the cleaner has pleated in the front so you can look like  you're in 1986, awkwardly in high school again, with white socks like a hillbilly.  And we wonder why we're still doing radio.  Let's see, that's what's cool about style, man. 
[02:04:00]  It's all about, it's no one style that's better than another.  I mean, to be honest, it's all personal.  You know, it's whatever you feel like.  Some days I feel like, you know, crap.  I mean, I didn't want to say that word.  And I look that way, so, you know, the way I dress is reflective of what I'm feeling  that day.  So we were talking, as Andre came in, we mentioned, I hope mentioned to him that you were in a  movie that we interviewed Guy Ritchie on called Revolver, which was an interesting movie.  It was really hard to follow.  A lot of listeners had thought it was kind of hard to follow.  Did you know what was going on, or were you, like, not 100% sure? 
[02:04:30]  Because I watched it, I think, like, one and a half times.  I'm like, I have no idea what's happening.  No, no, I definitely knew what was going on, but you really have to pay attention to it, you  know, even when reading the script.  You know, I had to read it, you know, lots of times, you know, to get it.  But I mean, I guess that was, you know, what he was going after.  And it was a really entertaining movie.  We had a great time doing it.  We shot it in London and on this island called the Isle of Man, where I was the only black  man on the island.  Really?  Why is that?  Yeah, it was, I don't know. 
[02:05:00]  I mean, it was kind of crazy.  I walked down the street and people would look at me like a unicorn.  You know, but not, not, not in like a racist way.  They were like, oh God, look at him.  Like, you know, like they've never seen a black person.  A unicorn is a great thing.  Like, like in that country, DreamWorks, it just has a black man walking out through clouds.  But did you get an explanation for this?  Of course, Jimmy.  Say it again?  Did you get an explanation why there were no black people on the island?  I mean, no, there was probably like one or two more, but I have no idea why.  It's so weird.  It's just, it's right off the coast of England and, you know, it's just a lot of sheep and 
[02:05:30]  a lot of land and, you know, you can film for cheap, you know, on this island and I don't  know, maybe, maybe, maybe the black people just don't want to go and watch sheep.  I don't know.  Eat awful British food with guys like, a guy makes you a nice guy, but, you know, I wouldn't  exactly hang out with him, you know, after work.  We played a lot of chess on set and Jason Statham and, you know, they teach me the English  slang and all this kind of stuff.  You're a chess player?  I love chess.  Jimmy's a big chess player.  Well, actually, I'm not a big chess player. 
[02:06:00]  I had to learn a couple of moves to actually play that role because I'm not a chess player.  I don't know it, you know.  And you don't want to look like a novice, like, horsey, right here.  Right, right, right.  You know what I mean?  It is a hard game.  Like, it's easy to learn which way the pieces move, but then just sitting there, I can't  play at all.  Yeah.  I don't know how they, like, oh, I'm already looking five moves ahead.  And I go, well, what if I do this?  You didn't see that coming.  Yeah.  How about I knock the board over?  There you go. 
[02:06:30]  See, it's a good thinking game.  You know, a lot of people, you know, they do know, you know, five, seven moves ahead of  you.  Wow, that's done.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And they say you can tell a person's kind of like the way they think by the way they play  this game.  Yeah.  Like, if they're really good at it, they're not idiots.  That's pretty much it.  I tried teaching my girlfriend, and I just wanted to dump her after three, so I can capture  this.  Just get out of my house.  I don't want to date you anymore.  Stick to checkers.  My son actually plays.  He's 10.  Yeah.  And he gets into it, man.  Like, hard call. 
[02:07:00]  You ever see those kids?  A lot of kids are like prodigies.  Like, a lot of those kids in the park will beat adults when they're seven or eight, which  is humiliating to lose to a child at any type of a thinking game when you're 40, and they're  like, you know, still in, like, third grade.  But a lot of kids, like, have just a knack for it, because their minds are really open.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why I just said that and expected people to, like, add to it.  I just made, like, a definitive, boring statement.  I was like, okay, I get it.  Let's go to...  I'll save it, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to James in Brooklyn.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  James?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey, James.  We got Andre Benjamin in studio from SemiPro. 
[02:07:30]  I'm a huge fan.  The first concert I was old enough to drive myself to was the Stank Onya Tour in St.  Louis, which was a fantastic, fantastic concert.  But I've followed you ever since I was maybe, like, 12 years old.  And back to your point earlier, Big Boy and Andre really are probably two of the greatest  lyricists that have ever existed in hip-hop.  Man, appreciate it, man.  No, it's great.  And to see what CeeLo's doing now, to, like, look back and play, like, play old Organized  Noise and Goody Mob records and then see what's going on now is just crazy. 
[02:08:00]  I know, man.  Sometimes I look at it and say, man, you know, we've had a crazy ride life, you know, to  start off, you know, one thing.  But to be honest, like, me and CeeLo, we've known each other since third grade, you know,  so all the Niles Barkley, all that, we've always, you know, just been doing things that  pleased us and had fun doing it.  We'd be on tour together, you know, singing and all that kind of stuff.  So it's not really like a, you know, let's change up and do new stuff.  Like, before we put out the first Outkast album, I remember telling Big Boy, hey, man, 
[02:08:30]  let's do this rock album and don't tell people that it's us, you know.  And so it was always there, you know, so it's not like a new, oh, they're trying to, you  know, sell records and all this kind of stuff.  I don't know if you remember me.  I saw you, in Boston, actually, they did the River Rave.  You guys headlined the River Rave a few years ago.  I don't remember.  For BCN.  After a while, it's, you know.  It was at BCN.  It was at the thing.  And afterwards, you took a bunch of pictures.  And when I came up and I, like, shook both your hands, I'm like, dude, that was a great  show.  I mean, I don't remember. 
[02:09:00]  I'm sorry.  Jimmy, you are an ass.  I get questions like that.  People, do you remember me?  We took a picture home.  Now you get those questions all the time.  It was like 50,000, 60,000 people.  It was a massive crowd.  Hey, so is Semi-Pro going to be good or what?  Yeah.  Give us a scoop on this, Andre.  Okay.  Okay.  To be honest, I mean, I'm a big Will Ferrell fan.  So when I saw Talladega Nights, I called my agent and I say, man, I mean, I've never really,  you know, did the comedy thing hardcore, but if I do it, I want to do it with this guy  right here.  So my agent, you know, he reached out to him and found out, you know, Semi-Pro was 
[02:09:30]  going on.  So I had to go in and audition for the movie with Will and he's one of the funnest people  in the world.  So when you go to this movie, if you love Will Ferrell, you're going to love this movie,  you know?  And if, if you love short shorts, long socks, big afros, I mean, it's really, it's really  straight on point to the period, man.  We had a great time doing it.  Woody Harrelson, you know, myself, Will Ferrell.  It's a...  I love the ABA too. 
[02:10:00]  Growing up, I loved the ABA.  Yeah.  You got to see some of the antics because it's on point.  I mean, we didn't stretch it too far.  We didn't stretch it.  I was bummed when that went away.  Yeah.  I mean, it's still around.  ABA's still around.  Well, they brought it back or...  Yeah.  I mean, it's, it's like...  A lot of cities have ABA teams, but it's not the same.  No, it's not like the original, but they are trying to...  Yeah.  That's right.  I did read something about it, but I'm not following it or anything, you know?  What do you like doing more of the acting or music?  To be honest, they're two totally different things because in music, I'm, I'm the writer, 
[02:10:30]  director, you know, produce everything, you know, you kind of, you control your whole  time, you know, you're not feeling like doing an album, you don't do an album.  And in movies, it's like you're, you're riding on the ship with a whole bunch of people  and you're taking direction.  I mean, it's a great balance, you know?  So that's you though, being, you know, your own producer and stuff.  Some musicians, they have to kind of listen to people and you're pretty, pretty lucky  to be talented like that, where you can just lay it out. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, I mean, I listen to, you know, but mainly when you, when you're writing rhymes,  I mean, well, some people get their rhymes written for them, but I mean, mainly you're  writing your own stuff.  So you're your own boss, which is sometimes bad, you know, cause you can take as much  time as you want to, which is bad.  Sometimes you take a little too much.  Yeah, I know.  And hopefully I'll have an album out this year.  I'm trying to crack my own whip.  One of our guys said that you, it's rumored that you're playing Hendrix.  Is that true?  There's been, there's been talks about it. 
[02:11:30]  The only thing is the music, you know, it's, it's been difficult getting rights to the music.  Oh, right.  So maybe, you know, one day I'd love to do it.  You know, I think it'd be a great thing.  I think it's a great time for Hendrix movie.  But maybe the, one day the family will, you know, let, let some.  See it your way.  Yeah.  Do they want too much money for the family?  Or is it Mitch Mitchell?  They're having all kinds of infighting, aren't they?  No, no, no.  I think the infighting is, is over with now.  I just think, I just think they want to make sure the project is, is, you know, a great 
[02:12:00]  project.  They, they don't want to let it go.  And then, you know, it's not the definitive Hendrix.  Right.  You know, movie, you know, yeah, they don't want some awful, they don't want like, you  know, 50 playing Jimi Hendrix or somebody that looks nothing like him.  Not that 50's not a terrific actor.  Oh, damn.  I said he's terrific.  I love his stuff.  Oh, stop it, man.  Who do you think is the best stuff?  Can I get your ass handed to you?  I actually like him.  Who's the best lyricist out there, would you say, in rap?  I go for Eminem for not the obvious reason.  Eminem is really challenging.  It's really hard to say who's the best. 
[02:12:30]  And they always get into these, you know, top five, all this kind of stuff.  But you really, they really have no credit because sometimes there's names in the top  five that shouldn't even be in there, you know, and then sometimes, you know, you can't  discount people from the past, you know, so it's kind of like, and then you can put  lyricists in certain categories, you know, you have certain people that just have, you  know, flair, you know, and they're great for punchlines, and you have certain people  that, you know, they actually have substance, you know, so it's kind of hard to say who's 
[02:13:00]  the greatest MC, to be honest.  Yeah.  All right, we got that.  That music you're hearing means that we're done with this side of the show.  We have to go over.  Oh, y'all trying to cut me off of that music?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Y'all want me to act like Kanye West or something?  Yeah, right?  Nine o'clock.  It's a computer that just goes, bam, and knocks us off the air.  We don't want to cut it off before the plugs.  Right.  Obviously, the movie's called Semi-Pro, starring Will Ferrell, and Andre Benjamin is in it,  and also Woody Harrelson.  And it starts this Friday.  It's in theaters.  It's obviously in theaters.  But you can see it today for free with us.  Only 75 people, so don't worry. 
[02:13:30]  We're not going to mess up your box office receipts.  But we're seeing it today at the AMC Empire, 234 West 42nd Street, right at 11.  First 75 people get to see Semi-Pro today for free.  And get a free corndog.  I mean, come on.  Yay!  Don't look at us, though.  We didn't come up with that.  Because we think that's kind of hacky to actually promote that we're giving out free corndogs  to see the movie with us.  We really are like a local zoo show he'll forget about before he leaves.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's part of the movie gag, you know.  Yeah, I enjoy it.  All right, very cool.  The corndogs are fun. 
[02:14:00]  It was a pleasure, Andre.  Thank you.  Well, thanks for having me on the show, man.  I'll be back, hopefully, with this new album.  That would rock.  We would like that a lot.  Yeah.  All right, we're over to XM.  Thanks, guys.  See you later.  All right, peace, man.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:14:30]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  All right, we got two out of the three guys here today.  Last I saw Jimmy, he was deep in conversation somewhere on a phone, so something's going on.  Hi, we're here at XM Satellite Radio, and we walked into the studio, and we see Fat Al Roker, who's gaining the weight back, interviewing Mini Black Earl. 
[02:18:00]  Mini Black Earl.  I don't think that's Mini Black Earl.  Gary Coleman is Mini Black Earl.  Is that who it was?  We got to kind of put them side to side, their pictures, because if Earl was a midget, he would look exactly like Gary Coleman.  And Gary Coleman's on with Al Roker with his new wife, who looks like a giant. 
[02:18:30]  She is, I guess, normal size, probably bigger than most people, tall gal, redhead.  And she was sitting there with this look like she had something wrong with her.  Yeah.  And you can only assume she does.  I say assume.  I'm assuming.  Uh-huh.  Because she's with Gary Coleman.  Yeah, Sam's going through the audio right now to see if anything is there, but there's any gems?  Well, the story goes that he hasn't had sex with his wife yet. 
[02:19:00]  And they've been married since July or something like that, so.  And it looked like he was on the brink of crying.  Oh, boy.  So, hopefully, we get some juicy audio.  She looked like somebody.  She looked like when you, like, when they drug a chimp to do dentistry on him.  Like, she had that look on her face.  Like, she was just waking up from the drugging?  Yeah, yeah.  Just coming around.  She still has.  Staring off into space.  But they tagged her, and they're going to let her loose.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're going to let her loose.  But very groggy.  Ah, she looked like. 
[02:19:30]  So, hopefully, we'll have that in studio.  If there's something there, if not, then you won't hear it.  Ignore that we even talked about mini black girl.  Forget all about it.  Hey, Damian Thomas, he's a regular from Akron, Ohio.  He's got a good question here on the instant feedback.  And it's something I was thinking about, and I'm glad you're bringing it up.  I missed the last few minutes of the FM show.  Did Anthony talk about Obama with Andre?  I was ready to bring up the Obama question with Andre.  And the only reason I was going to bring it up was because he's a black entertainer. 
[02:20:00]  And then I'm like, that's so a hack.  It really is.  I was thinking, if it comes up naturally, then sure.  Ask a black guy about Obama.  But I don't know.  It was in my mind, and I'm thinking, why are you going to just bring it up because he's black?  I know.  And he's barely black, too.  He's like, you know, he's white black.  Well.  Andre, he seemed kind of white black.  What do you mean?  He wasn't like ghetto.  Why?  Because he was well-dressed, well-spoken, and nice.  You're terrible. 
[02:20:30]  You're worse than me.  And he's in white boy movies.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know much about Outkast.  I know this much.  Every time I hear an Outkast song, I really, really, really like it.  Yeah.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to buy an Outkast CD or wristband.  We were talking about that.  Music is now on wristbands.  Which is pretty cool.  You got like on your...  The UB...  The USB.  Your USB port.  Yeah.  On your computer.  A wristband.  And the USB plugs into the other half of the wristband and kind of closes the wristband. 
[02:21:00]  Until you need it.  And then you need it.  You take it off.  You pop it in.  And there's the music.  And what they're doing at concerts, they're recording the concert that you go to live.  Yeah.  And then when you leave, you can then buy a wristband with the recording of the concert  on it that you just saw.  Right.  Which is pretty unbelievable when you think about technology and what you used to have  to go through and how impossible that was years ago. 
[02:21:30]  Know who did it?  I believe Matchbox 20 did it at their latest show.  Yeah.  You saw the concert.  And as you're leaving, they're giving you the USB wristband.  And it's the concert you just saw in audio format.  How great is that?  That's pretty cool.  And the old days, man, they'd wrestle you to the ground if you attempted to record a  concert.  But now it's like, now they finally realize the marketing value to that.  I remember a situation that I saw.  I forgot where I saw this, but a guy really got in trouble.  I believe the Doobie Brothers were playing.  Yeah.  And there was this very rotund black gentleman jumping around to the music. 
[02:22:00]  And his tape recorder fell out of his jacket.  And the band just stopped playing.  Yeah.  And very embarrassing for the gentleman with the tape recorder.  Noah was brilliant about that episode.  Episode?  What?  They stopped playing.  I know.  Let's tear down a wall here.  Jesus.  My God, man.  I was going to go with that for hours.  Hours.  The Doobie Brothers were playing for about 20 people.  And they got upset that one was actually recording. 
[02:22:30]  I'm thinking they should have been pretty happy that Rerun decided to record the Doobie Brothers  concert that they were doing for 20 people.  I don't even think they were on a stage.  They were on the floor the same level as everybody else.  And Rerun's up front jumping around.  And way to get crossover back then.  See, you got a black guy recording a white band.  Yeah.  The Doobie Brothers.  If I was the white band, I'm thinking this could be good for us because he's going to  take this back to the ghetto.  We're going to get a whole new audience. 
[02:23:00]  Some copy of the tape.  Right.  Pass it around.  Yeah.  Well, the problem they had with it was that the tape recorder was the size of a casket.  A giant.  Like, did you try to be subtle, fatso?  And he's jumping around to the Doobies.  And they're all like, we thought you were our friend, Rerun.  Yeah.  And the whole audience stops.  They can't believe it.  Someone was recording.  Sure.  How naive.  Trying to bootleg.  Hey, go back to the USB thing, by the way.  That's what we want to do with our animation festival.  Really?  Where are we at with our animation festival?  Let's get Steve in here.  Nowhere. 
[02:23:30]  What?  Let's get Steve in here.  Let's get the update on our animation festival.  But this is the other element.  Because I was reading about Matchbox 20, giving out the USB wristbands at the end of the show.  That's what I think we should do.  After our animation festival, we got the 20 or 30 animations.  A big celebration.  And we announced the winners.  As you're leaving the venue, USB wristband with the animations.  Nice.  The first Opie and Anthony USB wristband thing that we did.  That can't possibly cost $8 billion to put together. 
[02:24:00]  I don't think it would be that much.  I don't know.  Let's look into it.  But we are doing an animation festival.  We're going to get some comedians involved.  We're not calling a festival.  We don't know what the name is going to be yet.  Yeah.  We're thinking animation palooza fest stock.  Cartoon-a-palooza.  Mania thing.  But we're looking for a very big venue.  A respectable venue.  No offense to Hard Rock Johnny.  But we're trying to maybe do this at the Beacon Theater or somewhere really cool.  And we're going to get a bunch of comedians.  You get to check out animations.  And then we're going to announce a big animation winner. 
[02:24:30]  We're going to do the contest the right way.  We still got to get a winner for the animation contest that we kind of just threw out there.  We got to announce the winner of that one.  Steve, where are we at with the big animation festival that we're trying to put together?  Together.  A big animation festival?  Yeah.  Way to go.  You are the executive producer.  Yes.  Thank you.  And he just said, you're doing a what?  What do we got on it so far?  We got, I just walked into the studio and heard that you want to do a big animation festival.  I'm so, I'm not feeling well. 
[02:25:00]  You are the executive producer.  Yes, I understand that.  We talked about this yesterday.  And we had a lot of excitement.  Did we really?  In our voices.  Yeah, we really want to do this one.  I'm so glad.  I'm going to go beat up the staff now because I just walked in there and said, guys, can  you give me some, a little bit of a fill in?  Because I don't really know what they're talking about.  I was sick yesterday.  And I, and I, and I, and Stan and Sam look at me and go, they haven't really talked about  anything other than just the animation contest.  So go ahead.  You were, I'm sorry to hear you were sick.  Apparently he had a cold of the ears.  I said they only talked about it, what they said on air yesterday while you were IMing 
[02:25:30]  me.  So I assumed that you were listening to the show.  I'm not having this conversation.  Apparently there's an animation contest they want to do.  I will get on it.  Apparently.  Yeah.  It's between, by the way, me and everybody who listened to the radio yesterday.  Yeah.  Great.  Thank you for, you got it.  Hold on now.  We got a little, a little tension here.  No, there's no, there's no, there's no tension.  I'll find out exactly what you guys want to do.  If you guys want to tell me off the air, that's fine.  We want to do an animation contest.  No, we're doing it on the air.  The animation contest is on.  We're doing the animation contest.  This is real.  We decided that the animation contest that the other side put together sucked a big 
[02:26:00]  one.  Well, it didn't last long enough.  It was all about promoting a movie when it should have been promoting the radio show  and promoting the fine talent that these listeners have.  So now we want to do it the right way.  So the animation contest technically is still going on, even though we officially have to  announce a winner to the one that the other place did.  Is everyone following?  Sure.  But the contest continues and it's going to continue for at least a month to two months.  Yeah.  Well, sometime in April, we're going to be at a really cool venue with a big screen, 
[02:26:30]  a fine sound system.  We're going to get a couple of comedians.  We're going to we're going to show about 10 or 15 animations, no more than two minutes  of a piece.  We're going to take a little beer break, maybe throw another comedian on, maybe some  other debauchery that is associated with this fine radio show.  And then we're going to come back for the second half of the animations.  And then we're going to be doing a lot of and then we're going to announce the winner.  Yes.  And this guy will have bragging rights.  And then as everyone's leaving the studio, they get their dumb wow sticker that we have 
[02:27:00]  to hand out at every function.  But they're also going to get a USB wristband that has all the animations on them.  Very cool.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty.  That was you guys talking about when I came in.  That's pretty cool.  USB wristband.  That's brilliant.  Yes.  You see these things yet?  No.  Very cool.  It's a little USB thing.  And it goes around your wrist and like plugs in and you carry it around.  It's like a bracelet.  And then you take it off, pop it in your computer.  And what they've been doing at concerts, some bands have been recording the live show.  And then they sell them when you're walking out.  The show you just saw, they sell it. 
[02:27:30]  You put it right on your wristband.  You can do it on a computer right there?  Yeah, they sell the wristband.  They do it and they sell the wristband.  So you walk out with the concert you just saw in audio form.  And then you pop it in your computer and there you go.  And you got all the music from the concert you just saw.  How big is the, how many gigs is the thing?  Is it a big hard drive?  It's pretty cool, man.  It's at least a mega gig.  Oh, we just know such a thing.  Mega gig.  I got so mad about technology fuck-ups.  It's huge.  It looks like a big wristwatch with a Commodore 64 on it. 
[02:28:00]  Walk around with the ENIAC.  I have a love-hate relationship with the instant feedbackers today.  It's a hate relationship.  Oh, mostly hate.  They're trying to make fun of me because I mentioned Matchbox 20, like, that's so gay, blah, blah, blah.  It's called reading.  You took a...  It's called reading the entertainment section of a newspaper or a magazine.  You mentioned Matchbox 20, you homo?  Yeah, and I read Matchbox 20 at a recent show did this USB thing with the wristband,  and I think that's effing cool technology, and that we should bring it up on the show. 
[02:28:30]  I read it, too, with a much, much cooler band.  Oh, yeah?  I have no idea.  I wish.  Who, pink?  Do they sell those in stores, those wristbands?  Yeah, it's starting to become the thing, Jimmy.  I would love to sell those on that one.  Music is basically wristbands now.  How much are they?  Let's go get one now.  What's on it?  I don't know.  We're just figuring this out.  I'm sure Laszlo probably knows a lot about it.  This is just starting to come together.  Oh, okay.  Email the Las.  Yeah, we'll know.  Email that faggot.  We're on top of this one.  That faggot. 
[02:29:00]  Laszlo rules.  He's a fucking girl who knows too much about technology.  I don't know whether to fuck him or fight him.  Someone's saying...  Not someone.  This guy's got to get the credit.  I wish I could just say this, but in true O&A fashion, Pat's got a great idea.  Pat is good.  Pat on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Instead of wristbands, you guys should give out USB cock rings to everybody.  What do you say?  I love it.  USB cock ring.  That's fantastic.  Wonderful. 
[02:29:30]  Can I say hi to Carl in Jersey?  Yes, I can.  What's up, Carl?  Hey, what's happening?  Oh, B.  Listen, since I was paying attention to the pay yesterday and Steve apparently wasn't,  can I be a guest at this fine venue whenever it is?  I'd love to go.  You know, Steve, I don't think, really likes the radio show.  I think he likes the gig and all that, but, you know, when he's off the clock, he's off  the clock.  See, I, if I'm sick, I'm going to at least, like, email some people and see what happened  on the show.  Get caught up.  Go to the show's website, onaradio.com. 
[02:30:00]  Can I tell you, I was on...  Hold on, sir.  We'll get to you, sir.  I was on O&A Radio.  Can I tell you, I was very impressed.  Yeah.  God damn it.  What?  I was on the onaradio.com.  They're doing a great job.  I really was...  That's why we promote the hell out of it.  I was impressed with the way the videos and the animation, I was good.  I will promote any website that really gets the radio show and is all about the radio  show.  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  It doesn't get caught up in all the other nonsense and becomes nonsense instead of talking  about the radio show.  Yeah.  Mostly in a positive light, by the way, because there's enough negativity from other fuckheads 
[02:30:30]  out there.  MySpace.com slash Jim Norton is all about this radio show.  Is it?  Boo.  I'm...  Boo.  I'm going to give props to radiogoldfans.com.  Have to do it.  They're doing an okay job so far.  They're just a little organization that is attempting to, you know, get things going.  Yeah.  How about that?  And then you got Wackbag still, you know, going strong with talking about the radio show  for the most part.  Yeah.  That's all we ever asked for, by the way. 
[02:31:00]  That's the only thing we've ever asked for.  Yeah.  And we got more guests.  They've been waiting out there.  Patiently.  Listening to this crap, thinking this is more important than what we got to talk about?  No.  We just like to kind of, you know, pave the way a little bit first instead of just popping  in and getting a guest on.  Now these bastards are making Maroon 5 jokes.  Okay.  Please.  You already knocked me down with your words.  You know, I have a Nickelback wristband that I just love.  You know what? 
[02:31:30]  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  Oh, don't say it.  Nickelback is all right.  All right.  Let him fly.  Nickelback.  You could go a lot worse.  Hold on.  You could go a lot worse than Nickelback.  Yes, you can.  And that catchy, wordy song.  Tell me you don't kind of like start humming that a little bit.  A guilty pleasure.  What's the name of it?  About Rockstar?  That's what it's called.  It's Rockstar.  Nickelback.  You could get a lot worse than Nickelback, Anthony.  Our guests are staring at us.  Well, bring him in.  I already said, come on in.  What do you want, a formal invite?  Let's go. 
[02:32:00]  Chop, chop.  Chop, chop.  Look at Roland.  I wasn't staring at you.  I was staring at the TV.  Hi.  Wow, you're hot.  Hello.  What's going on?  Hello, sir.  How are you?  Oh, yeah.  Take a seat.  Yeah, sit wherever you want.  No problem.  Don't mind the coats.  We walk from one show to the other.  Yeah, we have a real stupid job.  We have to go from one studio to another studio halfway through our show.  Well, that's silly.  It's really silly.  I'm glad somebody thinks that.  Do you wear these things?  If you want to. 
[02:32:30]  Feel free.  You look like a casting guy.  A casting guy?  You look like an important person in entertainment.  Then that wouldn't be a casting guy.  I'm hoping to be discovered and taken away from this horse shit.  So good luck.  I'm going to be showing you nice to me.  You could be on our show.  You could be on our show.  Yeah.  I'm going to show you a lot of profile.  I'm going to show you a nice smile.  I got beautiful blue eyes.  Yeah, you're doing good already.  I love it.  And you've heard, obviously, this is, we have a studio, a Marshall, or how do you say it?  Herskovitz?  Herskovitz.  Herskovitz. 
[02:33:00]  And I'm going to try this.  Bitsy Tulloch?  Tulloch.  I suck.  Bitsy Tulloch.  Yeah, it's okay.  And obviously you've been told you look like Bush.  I'm sure many times you've heard you look like Bush.  Oh, yeah.  A younger Bush.  I look like Bush?  George Bush, yeah.  A little bit.  The shave of your face?  Oh, man.  I'm out of here.  I know, right?  I love hearing that.  That's disturbing.  Oh, for two right now.  No, I've heard Mandy Patinkin, but not Bush.  Mandy Patinkin.  That's because I'm dressed up today, because I had to go on the Today Show.  Oh, really?  Oh, look at that.  How was it?  It was good.  We were outside.  It was cool.  Yeah, it was cool. 
[02:33:30]  Wolfram and Woody Harrelson were running around with basketball.  And we jumped out of a plane.  It was good.  That's me on the monitor.  We tried to get them on the other side of the show.  We had Andre from Outkast, one of the guys in that film.  But, you know, Will doesn't want to do radio, so we'll just keep promoting that fucking  movie with the fucking corndogs.  I'm sure it's a real hoot.  Another athlete movie.  We get it, Will.  We're stuck with 75 corndogs.  The guy can't even come over and say hi to us.  How about Woody Harrelson, for Christ's sake? 
[02:34:00]  Please, can we at least get Woody Harrelson?  I mean, Andre was cool and all, but I bet you he has a big part.  Sorry, you have to see this.  Oh, sorry, yeah.  I'm currently a little confused, but I'm trying to keep the microphones right in the  middle of both of you, but I can see everyone.  Actually, you don't have to pay attention to these people.  I'm meeting these two.  Yeah.  We're good.  We'll talk.  So, tell me a little about the show.  The show is called Quarter Life.  It premieres tonight on NBC at 10 p.m.  Yeah.  10 p.m. on NBC, and then on Sunday, we move to our regular time slot, which is Sundays  at 9, and it is Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick's new one-hour drama, and the last 
[02:34:30]  shows they did were My So-Called Life and 30-something and Once and Again, and they did  Blood Diamond and Catholic and The Last Camerox.  All right, look, man, she's my press agent.  Just take me away from this hell, please.  Listen, man, we're going to put you in the show.  I'll get on a plane right now.  We're going to put you in the show.  No, he's ready to go.  Really?  You know, somebody in the show is going to do something, and you guys are going to invite  them on, and we'll do it here, you know?  Yeah, I like that.  Actually, this show is based on, didn't it start on the internet?  Yes, it certainly did.  It started on the internet.  It's still on the internet. 
[02:35:00]  It's still on the internet.  But is this the first of its kind, like a show from the internet making the leap to regular  TV?  Yes, because this is the first time anybody's done a show for the internet that could go  to TV.  In other words, we sort of made it like it was a real show, you know?  Like network.  Yeah, spending our own money like idiots.  Really high production value, so it made sense to segue.  Lonely Girl 15, is that you?  No, no.  I'm not.  I didn't think so.  No, I wasn't.  I was on it, but...  Okay, okay.  I didn't think so.  And it said Lost.  What were you in Lost?  Well, you know, the funny thing about Lost, and there's some uproar on the internet about 
[02:35:30]  it, is because it never actually aired, because it was supposed to be a potential recurring,  and then I was shooting my show for two months.  It's the last episode of Lost.  I was shooting my show for two months, so I couldn't finish it.  Did you learn anything?  Yeah, do you know what happens?  Yeah, did you learn anything?  I played a Dharma Initiative scientist, and I got to play with bunnies.  Yeah, big, fat, fat bunnies.  But they never aired it.  Yeah, no, it never aired.  It's probably on the internet somewhere, but it never aired.  Was it the bunnies with the spray-painted numbers on it?  Yes!  Okay.  Don't tell me I didn't get that far.  That's okay.  Hey, please, I didn't get that far.  I thought you looked familiar. 
[02:36:00]  I'm still on season three.  Yeah.  The bunnies weren't really into me.  No?  No.  Why not?  I don't know.  I'm shocked.  Were you scared?  They could sense fear, bunnies.  I don't know.  Yes, they do.  I know.  I scare them and just like their little huts and just tip over to their sides and make  them go to sleep.  Remember Ben did that?  We thought he killed the rabbit, but he didn't, thank God.  Let's go back to it.  Let's go back to it.  So, Coraline started on the internet as what?  I don't know anything about this.  Okay.  It started on the internet as a show that was in these little eight-minute pieces, but 
[02:36:30]  they come together into hour-long stories.  Okay.  And this comes because Ed Zwick and I have done a lot of TV over the years, and we got  sick to death of networks telling us what to do and, you know, thinking they were smarter  than we were.  And finally, we said, to hell with this.  Let's go and do it on our own.  We'll do it on the internet.  We'll make a lot of money.  That was the only part that was wrong.  Yeah.  We haven't made any money yet.  We're spending money.  Was it on a website, or was it more like a YouTube thing?  Well, it was on MySpace, and it was also on our website, quarterlife.com. 
[02:37:00]  Okay.  Which everybody should go to, because it's a social network for creative people, for artists,  for passionate people, for people trying to create their life.  There ought to be tens of people going there, then, because when I go to MySpace or any of  those things, or YouTube, 99% of the stuff is a waste.  That's the vast wasteland.  That's the problem.  That's the point.  But ours is a site where the talented people go.  It's really amazing.  Really?  You've got to check it out.  He's not biased at all.  Oh, I will.  So, these little eight-minute shows, what were they about? 
[02:37:30]  Well, it's about six people in their 20s sort of trying to figure out their lives.  Bitsy plays a writer who works at a magazine and blogs about her friends and gets in trouble,  and somebody else is an actress.  Two other guys are filmmakers.  You know, people sort of trying to figure out how to, you know, what their life is going  to be.  Is everyone trying to have sex with each other?  Yes.  Well, that does happen, but I wouldn't say that's what it's about.  But, you know, it's kind of...  And by the way, the opera word is try.  Try.  Everybody's in love with the person they can't have. 
[02:38:00]  Yep.  All right.  That's never happened to anybody here.  I'd love to play an older gentleman on the show, like the older gentleman who comes into  town and the young girls are kind of smitten with.  The creep.  Hey, buddy.  The internet's a creep.  Yes, that's me.  I put myself in the pilot as an acting teacher.  No, he really did.  Who sleeps with one of the actresses?  He's a smart man.  I'm a method actor.  This is what happens when you get powerful in Hollywood.  Very smart guy.  I caught some shit for that.  See, we delve into a little internet stuff here ourselves. 
[02:38:30]  We have Pal Talk, which is just kind of, you know, a little video thing.  So we have people, they watch us.  I should pick a bunch of cameras here to go to.  I see.  And we watch one attractive girl out of 50 people that are online.  Does she know she's being photographed?  Yes, she does.  Hi, Jen.  How are you?  It's been much hotter if she had no idea.  Hold on.  There, she's waving.  Wait a minute.  What?  You don't like the name Jen.  On her, I do.  See, this is cool. 
[02:39:00]  I'm going to put one of our people on that.  Yeah, see?  And we'll put you guys in the show.  You should.  You're in the wrong city, that's all.  We can't afford to come here.  What do you guys film, L.A.?  L.A., yes.  Yeah, it's not set in L.A., but we film in L.A.  So then now that you make the move to NBC, does the show change now?  No, sir.  It's the same show.  By the way, we're delivering completed episodes to NBC.  They don't even know what the stories are about.  That's never happened in the history of television.  We have creative control.  Now, why is that?  Because you guys got the backing of the fans from the internet? 
[02:39:30]  Because it's an internet show.  It's a show we're making, and they're just basically licensing the show.  So they don't have any say in the creation of it.  It's incredible.  It's kind of nice to see that TV's embracing the internet, finally.  They looked at it like, ah, that thing.  It's a fad.  They're scared of it.  They're scared of it.  But like TMZ, as a TV show now, it's just basically the website on TV.  And I said, finally, they're going to embrace the fact that some cool, creative stuff is happening on the internet.  Well, you know, it's all going back and forth. 
[02:40:00]  And who knows, three or five years from now, it's all going to be the same.  You'll have that big screen in your room, be your TV, your computer, you know, and so it'll all be mixed together.  Are you worried that NBC, though, with their standards and practices and all that, will come in and take a show that's a finished product and go, ah, that's not right for the network, and then take something that may be critical out for the storyline?  All right, we have to make some changes for NBC, but they are FCC requirements, stuff you guys would know about.  We know about, but we constantly break the law. 
[02:40:30]  We have to take out certain words, and that's all.  But we have not made any changes, and nothing, there's no aesthetic changes, no creative changes.  They don't have any input about that stuff.  Good.  It's pretty wild.  Good for you guys.  That's great.  Hell yeah.  And do you have, like, a website connection?  Like, do people watch it on NBC and then maybe go to the quarterlife.com or NBC.com?  Yeah, there's a call-out to quarterlife.com on the NBC site so that people can come and see.  It's really, quarterlife.com has become this amazing thing. 
[02:41:00]  You really should check it out.  It's like, that's the thing.  Unlike MySpace, where people go out there and say, hey, look at me, and, you know, this is people who are really serious, want to be artists.  They want to be filmmakers.  They want to be photographers.  And it's, like, filled with really, really cool people connecting.  It sounds original, definitely.  Different.  I like it.  I'll pick it up.  All right.  I like it.  There you go.  This was a pitch meeting, right? 
[02:41:30]  No, that really sounds cool.  Yeah, we're excited.  We're having a good time.  We're having a really good time.  And there's this whole, like, user-generated concept that they're coming up with, assuming the show goes forward, where people can actually, like, submit music and photos and, you know, maybe they'll end up having it on the show as part of it.  Yeah, we're calling it user-generated television, where all the stuff on the show is going to come from our community.  Wow.  And, Bitsy, what did you do with Lonely Girl 15?  I shot Lonely Girl 15 after I shot the pilot for Quarter Life, and I was playing this kind of evil character who was affiliated with the Order. 
[02:42:00]  And it's funny, because I was initially hired to only do five episodes, but the fans were really into it, because at that point, it was before it expanded.  So, you really just had those three hero characters, and they were kind of into this ambiguously evil character.  And I ended up doing 15, and I was doing something in the Order, and I still, honestly, don't know what the Order is.  Like, they never even explained it to me.  I just was like, all right, I'll go with it.  I was duped by that whole Lonely Girl 15.  A lot of people were.  At first, I was like, wow.  I didn't know it was all set up or anything. 
[02:42:30]  Just a girl talking from her bedroom, I thought.  It's brilliant.  I thought it was too well edited.  Did you know right away?  I had heard about it and heard that there were people that thought it was kind of a put-on.  So, I went into it a little bias, and then once I saw it, I was like, this is a little too well done.  That's smart of you.  Because most of the stuff, oh, I troll it all the time and just look and go, oh, this is crap, this is crap, this is fake.  Right.  It's getting easier to distinguish between the fake and the real stuff. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Probably true.  Well, we never tried to pass ours off as real, so.  Mm-hmm.  Although, there is a lot of confusion with the show, which I think is a testament to the show itself and the directing and the producing and the acting.  Even a month after it had premiered online, people were really confused and emailing me on MySpace.  Yeah.  Like, is this a reality show?  Are you you?  Are you your character?  I'm confused.  There are a lot of confused people out there.  It's really true.  It's just the way it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else were you in? 
[02:43:30]  You look very familiar.  West Wing she was in.  Oh, really?  West Wing was my first professional gig, yeah.  Really?  Not a bad one to get.  Right after I moved to L.A., I've done Cold Case.  I recently did Moonlight.  I have a movie with Sam Jackson coming out this fall called Lakeview Terrace.  Just booked an animated feature, my first.  Does Sam Jackson just run from set to set of movies that he's on?  I really do.  The 10,000 movies he makes a year?  Yeah.  That guy's going to pull in 150 G's a year.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  And plays golf more than anybody in the world. 
[02:44:00]  Does he really?  He's a golfer.  Is he good?  Time for that.  He's a golfer.  Yeah, apparently really good.  Hey, can I bring Roland in here for a second?  Sure.  You know Roland?  Did you get to do scenes with Alan Alda, by the way?  What?  Did you get to do any scenes with Alan Alda on West Wing?  No.  No.  It was with Bradley Whitford and Janelle Maloney, but it was funny because I graduated  from Harvard, and the first thing I did when I walked into Bradley Whitford's office,  I was like, dude, the diplomas are not that small.  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now.  You don't blow by, I graduated from Harvard. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I know.  How do you just do that?  By the way, I graduated from Harvard, and combined we have nine years of education.  Yeah, when I moved out to L.A., he's like, you want to remind me why I just spent $150,000  on your education as you're just moving to Hollywood?  What was your major?  I double majored in literature and the fine arts.  Jesus.  Nice.  I don't like most classic literature.  Like, I try reading the scarlet letter.  Not good.  You read the first 50 pages and then the cliff notes after it.  That's how I did it in college.  Exactly. 
[02:45:00]  It has to pray for me.  I like this guy.  He's a cheater like me.  Absolutely.  I just want to hang out with hot chicks.  Yeah, of course.  He gets it.  He's dug through a few garbage pails in his day to find tests.  Hey, Roland's a nervous mess, but he's really, really good at getting guests for our show.  Extremely good.  He's very valuable to us.  Right, Roland?  He looks valuable back there in the corner.  Yeah.  Nobody put a baby in the corner.  He made sure I got a muffin, so I like that.  Roland?  Yeah.  But we'll make call him this week.  He's not blowing you guys off. 
[02:45:30]  Just so you know.  How about Woody, though?  What about Woody Harrelson?  Woody H?  What's that called?  I want to talk about natural born killers.  I saw him on Sunday, but he had to go back because he had a tight schedule.  Listen how good he is on the radio.  Isn't he great?  I received that.  But he's on the show today.  I'm a little confused.  Yeah.  I could have stopped him and I would just say hi.  See, Roland's also great at the excuses of why people aren't on our show.  Right, Roland?  No.  I just tell the truth.  He's on the space shuttle this week.  He's not here.  No, he was busy, though.  I brought Roland in because he just said he tells the truth. 
[02:46:00]  Well, no.  I mean, I just think...  I want you to explain to our guests why they're on our show today.  I'm ready.  And we have no problem with you guys being on our show, by the way.  Yeah.  We're enjoying you guys.  It has nothing to do with it.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Roland, I want you to tell everybody what you did.  Oh.  No.  We're ready.  Are you sure you're ready?  I don't know.  He's ready.  It's nothing that bad, is it?  Don't be insulted by what he's about to say because I will explain. 
[02:46:30]  It doesn't matter.  Go ahead.  All right.  Roland?  Did I just send an email out?  No.  No, no, no, Roland.  What?  No.  Roland?  Come on, Roland.  How did this come about?  They tortured me on air.  It wasn't a torture.  It wasn't a torture.  It was like...  Let's just put it this way.  I'll explain this much.  There's people and guests that are offered to us that we don't know much about, so it's  very safe to say no.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  You guys might have been in that no category is all I'm saying, but Roland, we did a little 
[02:47:00]  negotiating with Roland.  Yeah.  And by the way, this is working out for us because I see your people out there getting  very nervous.  Oh, no.  So we negotiated with Roland, and Roland, what did you do on air?  You guys gave me a prostate exam.  Roland got a prostate exam.  By a doctor.  By a doctor.  To get how many?  Three.  To get three, what we call free passes.  All right.  He could book anyone that he wants on the show.  Okay, this is fine, but why did Roland want us?  Because I love the show. 
[02:47:30]  Isn't that cool?  This is my man.  Isn't that sweet?  This is gross, but it's great.  It is.  Isn't that cool?  This is a great story.  So technically, it really is.  It really is.  Wow.  I believe that you should actually come in.  He believed in you guys so much that he took a finger up the ass line on our show.  This is my man.  Wait.  Don't misinterpret.  Let's hear my man.  It wasn't like we didn't want you guys on the show.  We hadn't said yes or no.  No, he didn't know who the fuck we were.  He thought he was in jazz.  I get it.  Roland just came in and said, these are two of the guests I'm going to use. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  But that's what he did.  It's working out again.  Yeah.  It's a shame this is radio because this is a very lovely woman.  He was fantastic.  Had you known what she looked like, I don't think he would have had to get a finger up  his ass.  Yeah, there wouldn't have been anything instead of thinking that the casting agent and his  bring your daughter to work day thing is going on here.  Do we have the audio of Roland?  See, that's what you need to be doing.  Oh, you're not going to show up.  Why would they do anything?  No, no.  No, there's no showing.  It's radio.  Thank God.  See, that's why. 
[02:48:30]  I'm really touched by this story.  I really am.  Well, we figured we'd make it fun for you guys as well because you do a lot of interviews  and you might wonder why you're on certain shows and not on others.  It's true.  I was kind of out there asking my publicist.  I'm like, what are we doing here?  What are we doing here?  In our case, that fine gentleman over there had to take a finger up his ass.  But it's good on two things.  He's a fan of the show.  That's the coolest.  And he's going to be around a while because his prostate was very healthy. 
[02:49:00]  Very healthy.  I'm glad to hear that.  You have a fan that won't be getting soaked.  Hopefully, if we come back, it won't be quite so torturous.  No.  Exactly.  No.  Yes.  So have you guys gotten in trouble recently?  What's your most recent?  What do you know about us being a bigwig in Hollywood?  Well, I know about the church thing.  Oh, the church thing.  Yeah, I know about that.  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  Not bad about that.  Oh, for me, that was thumbs up.  I was going way to go.  Okay. 
[02:49:30]  I like these guys.  Clearly, people don't understand.  And their sense of humor.  Yeah, we were making a statement, man.  Freedom of religion.  That's what I say.  Exactly.  We've been good boys for almost...  Two hours?  Ten months.  We've been out of trouble for about ten months.  Uh-huh.  So we're due.  Is it better being over here on the satellite side?  When you're explaining the whole thing with the internet and being able to do whatever  you want and stuff?  Absolutely.  But this is our dilemma.  We don't feel like we're talking to enough people yet.  Yes.  So for us to be able to do both, kind of like what you're doing, that's what's exciting 
[02:50:00]  for us, because we still want to reach as many people as possible with this crap, like guys  getting fingers up their ass and stuff.  I have a lot more fun on this side, though, because the freedom is here.  Right.  Right.  But there's never...  It's never...  Right.  ...less fun to have freedom.  Yeah.  I understand.  But it's getting easier and easier to maybe do satellite full-time, because the numbers  are starting to get up there.  Yeah.  Like when we started...  Same thing on the internet, by the way.  The internet audience...  It's never less fun to have freedom.  What?  Not quite a Jefferson quote. 
[02:50:30]  It's never less fun to have freedom.  That's true.  Wow.  Maybe he said that.  That's a regular...  Ask not what you...  If you want to do things for your country, don't ask what your country can do, but rather  what...  Never less fun, bitch.  I'm a bumbling ass.  Never have fewer had more fun than the greatness of the...  Whatever.  For less people than...  As far as technology goes, we're in a transitional period, and it's kind of exciting, because  I'm starting to find myself spending a lot more time watching videos and stuff on the 
[02:51:00]  internet than I did two years ago.  That's right.  It's obviously, like you said, it's really starting to grow at a quick pace.  But the numbers, just like what you're dealing with, the numbers of people that watch video  content on the internet is nothing compared to television.  No, right?  Nothing.  Yeah.  It's like one-tenth.  So that's the problem.  When you get a video that gets a million views, we've had a few in our day with some  of the stuff we're doing.  Yeah, but that's a one-time thing.  It's not like a series yet.  I understand, but even a million doesn't compare to what million... 
[02:51:30]  What is going to watch Quarter Life on NBC?  2.3 million.  2.3 million I got on one of my YouTube videos.  2.3 million hits.  Wow.  Good for you.  Wow.  Did you ever see the Seattle video of the guy on the horse?  That's him.  Hey, that wasn't me.  Do we have Roland getting the finger up his ass?  Looking.  Oh, boy.  We can all do that.  Oh, are Steve going to get a beating after the show?  Yeah, we'll do it all together.  We've all had it done.  Actually, Steve's not going to get a beating today. 
[02:52:00]  Now I go right to Eric Lowe.  Well, not all.  There's somebody in this room without sans prostate.  Wow.  You know.  Wow.  Women don't have them.  Wow, I was talking about the men in the room.  Okay.  Yes.  I should have assumed that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, so Roland, you're off the hook.  They don't replay it.  Why do you keep looking out there?  Are you getting nervous on us?  What?  No, I was seeing what he was bringing in.  Oh, yeah, because Kenny just lumbered in with the...  It looked like food, and I was like, hey.  Are you going to split my turkey sandwich with Jimmy?  Split a turkey sandwich with Jimmy. 
[02:52:30]  This is Kenny.  Thank you, sweetie.  Hey, Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  How are you doing?  Kenny, show your personality.  Why don't you grab a mic.  Grab Roland's mic.  He's not using it.  This is our trained killer.  He looks like one.  I don't want to interrupt your interview.  What interview?  He even gets it.  He's just eating a muffin going, all right, I'm with you guys.  What the hell is this crap?  Is that hold even on the air at all?  Let me just plug my show.  I want to live here.  This is great.  I've got a surprise for you guys. 
[02:53:00]  You might be one of our guests that actually go, when are we going to go on the air?  We've been on the air for 20 minutes.  This is Clubster to Kenny.  He's a big wig in Hollywood, Kenny.  You might get discovery here.  Yeah, but is he in the March issue of GQ magazine?  No.  I don't think so.  Who's in the March issue of GQ magazine?  Oh, P and Anthony.  Really?  Who are they?  Oh.  Exactly.  See, that doesn't impress a guy like this.  You're going to have to be much better than that.  We are.  Look at his small dinosaur head.  It really is a little Bronto head. 
[02:53:30]  My head is very small.  He actually has to grow his hair out on the sides to make it look like a normal head.  You're more like a stegosaurus.  You have a real little head and a big body.  Maybe you could cast him if you're doing a story about a witch doctor.  And he could be the one who said the inappropriate thing.  I'm good at that.  Shrunk his head and his hair's really dry.  What should he do?  Your hair has a nice luster to it.  What do you use?  It's my fabulous hairstylist, Jeremy Clark, who's sitting up there who did this.  What's up, Jeremy?  Good job, dear. 
[02:54:00]  You did her hair for a radio interview?  Absolutely.  But look at what happened.  I mentioned it.  There you go.  Who is that cool person in the hat and the glasses?  That's my cute little publicist.  I call her Sasquatch.  Sasquatch.  That's always affectionate for a woman.  Why would you?  Well, no.  See, we were on a photo shoot for Interview Magazine, and I came out in this gorgeous Versace gown,  and she was like, wow, you look like such a sex pot.  And I thought she called me Sasquatch.  And I was like, oh, my God, I totally love that you called me Sasquatch.  And she was like, I didn't call you Sasquatch, you idiot. 
[02:54:30]  That would be nice for a sexy look.  You're just like the Yeti.  Good luck to you.  Now go.  Oh, you look like the abominable snowman.  I thought she had a hairy...  All right.  Well, that is an odd thing to tell when you look like Sasquatch.  I mean, you have to go with that.  I kind of like that look.  She looks kind of cool.  Now, a little fedora.  Sure.  Little black boots and glasses.  And her hair is probably up right behind.  She has long hair.  It's up.  My cut?  She's cute, right?  Is this the best interview you guys have done?  Cute girl.  Best interview?  No question.  Today?  Yes, so far.  No question. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah?  Anyone ever tell you you look like Rick Yorn?  Do you know who Rick Yorn is?  Talk about big wig in Hollywood.  Oh.  Could this be good for me?  Famous manager?  No.  Oh, manager.  I don't want to be a manager.  No, he's going to be a very important guy.  Who's Rick Yorn?  Yeah, he doesn't want to look like anyone else.  He's going to be on the show.  I'm going to be on the show, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's handsome.  Yeah.  Are we going to try to have sex on the show?  No.  No.  You're going to try.  That's too far.  No, well, too far.  Very cool.  You're terrible.  Why am I terrible?  Because you'll have to be a creepy guy. 
[02:55:30]  No.  Would I be a creepy guy?  No.  What would I be?  You would be a boss.  Let me think here.  You would be a boss.  Go around the room and tell...  You could work at Women's Attitude Magazine.  You could work at Women's Attitude Magazine.  That's like a gay thing.  I don't want to do the gay thing.  You're a boss.  Oh, that's good.  No, it's not good.  Go around the room and tell each of us what we would play on quarter life, let's say.  Okay.  Because you're good at this, right?  You're going to be a well-meaning boss who's about to be fired because you refuse to compromise 
[02:56:00]  your principles.  Okay.  Wow.  That's a stretch.  Yeah, seriously.  How about...  Can we switch that a little bit?  All right.  How about a boss who is always ready to be fired and compromise his principles?  Yeah, and completely compromise his principles.  Well, yeah.  How about Anthony?  All right.  Anthony...  Let's see now.  Anthony is going to be, when they have a new apartment, because they just lost their 
[02:56:30]  apartment, when they have a new apartment, okay, he's going to be the guy that lives  down the hall.  Yeah.  That they're worried is a child molester.  Worried?  But it turns out he's a famous psychologist and has actually, you know, saved a lot of  people.  Hey, that's all right.  You got a good one.  I like that.  That's better than my boring role.  I don't like the famous psychologist thing.  Why would they assume I would be into young girls?  Maybe they saw your hard drive. 
[02:57:00]  We're trying to get a prom date for Anthony.  For real.  Really?  And I know it sounds like a hacky radio bit, but we're going to do it in our own style.  In a high school prom?  Look.  Oh, yeah.  Your own style is stupid and shouldn't even be touched on.  Well, our angle is that the girl has to put out.  I'm not going on a prom date, first of all.  Is there anything wrong with that?  I'm not going with a girl as a prom date.  That's interesting.  Yes, and I'm not going to violate some high school girl for this program. 
[02:57:30]  Really?  Do it on my own time.  He dates two kinds of girls, 18 and 19.  That is not true.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy and Coraline.  I've upped it a couple of years.  Yeah.  What would Jimmy be?  What if we can vote out?  Jimmy is a, let's see, what is Jimmy?  Debonair, older gentleman.  Like a John Forsythe type.  Yes.  Who comes in as a lawyer.  Get E-Rock and Kenny in here, too, because we're going to continue this bit.  Yeah.  One of them, yes, one of them has a car accident, and you're the insurance agent who comes to 
[02:58:00]  figure out, and then you hit on one of the girls.  And she's quadriplegic, and as I'm working on her settlement, I say, look that way, and  I give her breast a little squeeze.  And I continue with the paperwork.  Oh, my God.  And how about Kenny and E-Rock?  We just might have lost Bitsy on that one there, Jimmy.  She's right with us.  She's fine.  I was thinking he could be more like the brother of the Nebushy character on the show.  Oh, there you go.  He could be Andy's brother.  He could be Andy's brother.  He could be Andy's sort of Debonair older brother.  Kenny, can you come into the light? 
[02:58:30]  I don't know where the Debonair is coming from.  All right.  This is Kenny.  No, how about him and E-Rock together, though, because I think they should be an alternative  couple that he's in.  I like him separately, though.  I know what Kenny is.  Kenny's 6'5".  Kenny is the bouncer at a club.  Of course.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Who gets into a relationship with Lisa because she flirts with him in order to get in, and  it turns out that they have all this stuff in common, and they end up having this real  relationship.  Yeah, but I don't like girls.  What is that?  You're an actor.  Why do you have to try?  You're an actor.  You're an actor.  Yeah, why? 
[02:59:00]  Pretend.  How about this?  Kenny's the bouncer who everyone thinks is retarded, but then they test him and realize  he almost is.  Not quite that bright.  Who's this person?  What's he going to be on the show?  E-Rock, why don't you say something?  Show this man your personality.  There's not much to go with there, but I'm Eric.  Hi, Eric.  How are you?  Oh, we already have an Eric on the show.  Sorry.  Can he be Ted, the president of the Tiny Sweater Club?  Actually, you know, it's funny you should say president. 
[02:59:30]  He's a guy who's already made $15 million selling a web design company, and he's a young,  rich guy.  Oh.  Yeah, is he?  Well, he kind of is.  And he's known around the neighborhood for washing his clothes and then drying them on  very high heat.  Stupid dicky.  It's not that bad.  No, it's not.  I mean, it's not great, but it's not that bad.  It's not great.  It's a medium.  Trust me.  He's a disaster in many ways.  We like you, Rocky.  He's a good boy.  Well, we tolerate him.  How about Sam?  How about young Sam?  Who's going in Afro for Afro Wars? 
[03:00:00]  All right.  Young Sam.  Okay.  Wow.  Wow.  Wait, why the wow, Bitsy?  He's in the hair.  Young Sam should actually be on the show.  The rest of you guys forget it.  You're a bunch of old boys.  Young Sam.  You know what?  I think...  You know what?  We're going to talk to you afterwards.  I want you to read...  There's a part I want you to read for her.  I would love to do that.  I think he'd be great as...  Let's see.  When Eric...  Wait a minute.  Are you serious?  Yes.  Are you serious?  I'm looking at him right now.  I'm like, oh shit. 
[03:00:30]  He's serious.  You're so old.  This guy, this fucker, just is on call.  It's Sam.  He's in the demo.  His whole attitude just changed.  He's in the demo.  That's a real casting call now.  Yeah.  I'm a creative 20-something.  It's our target demographic.  He has to get hurt his face.  What the fuck?  I think Sam just got discovered.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat Duffy waiting in the wings.  I think it's finally going to happen, buddy.  So what would he be?  I think he's a graduate student who falls in love with Debra and... 
[03:01:00]  Supports her in a Garfunkel cover band.  She's in a difficult moment in her life, and he's so sweet to her that for about a month  they get together, and then she breaks his heart.  You're going to like this, by the way.  The girl who plays Debra is a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model.  Yeah.  All of a sudden.  From 1937.  She's an older lady.  Michelle Lombardo.  She's on Entourage. 
[03:01:30]  You would know her.  Are you guys really going to talk after the show?  No.  To Sam?  No.  If he wants to...  By the way, that's the point.  He should come on cornerlife.com, put his picture on, and if there's a possibility, then  we'll cast him.  You should get Sam.  You guys should bypass that and get him an audition, because if Sam can act and get discovered,  he's a real deadweight on this program.  Sam, how old are you?  I'm 24.  See?  He's the demo.  He's right in there.  I was going to say, he doesn't look old enough to be a grad student.  No, he's got a very earnest face. 
[03:02:00]  I like it.  Thank you.  Do you think he's black?  Do you think he's a real descendant of Thomas Jefferson?  He's a real descendant of Thomas Jefferson.  He's got a Jew-pro.  He's a Jew-pro.  Absolutely.  He's got Thomas Jefferson in his past.  I'm serious.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a Jeffersonian-type person?  Yes, he looked back at his genealogy.  Are you an intellectual?  Yes, I am.  What's your last name?  Roberts.  Roberts.  Yeah.  He's from the side.  How did you get that hair?  I don't know.  Well, just there one day.  You're going to have to ask Thomas Jefferson about that. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  You know about the other side.  Of the family.  Well, Jefferson occasionally went out back.  Yeah.  I'm going for a walk, honey, with some lemonade.  Are you related to Thomas Jefferson?  Yeah, he really is.  No joke.  We did the family tree.  He's like a great-great-great-great-great-cousin or something.  Cousin?  A great-cousin.  A great-cousin.  He's related to Jefferson the same way we're all related to, like, Adam and Eve.  Yeah, exactly.  No, exactly.  Actually, a bottleneck.  I don't have the paperwork in front of me, but he's there.  No, you can always try out for the show. 
[03:03:00]  I will.  That's it.  And what New York casting?  What website should he go to?  Let's get the big plugs.  Quarterlife.com.  You want to do Travis or Than real fast?  Any of these guys?  No, Travis is...  I haven't even seen you.  Travis, get out here.  Okay.  No, that's Than.  Who are you?  I'm Than.  Oh, all right.  Well, you're the one I saw.  Okay, you're the...  Let's see.  What is he?  He looks like an FBI agent who is investigating Eric for un-American activities because of 
[03:03:30]  his political activism.  Wow, that's good.  Yeah, he's a young FBI agent.  He looks like he'd be a friend of Eric's.  He could be a friend of Eric's, but actually he's a double agent working for the FBI.  Nice.  Well, can I make an amendment?  He's an FBI agent who also has dreams of being an actor, so he goes out and auditions  for commercials that he never gets.  Because we ruin them for him.  Yeah, because I give you guys the script and read it on air.  Yeah, that didn't work out too well.  And, of course, our own Travis. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Right here.  Travis.  This little waif-like...  He looks like he could be from New Orleans.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Maybe Debra brings him back from New Orleans.  He's a...  That's perfect.  He's a friend that Debra brings back from New Orleans.  Yeah.  See if you can give me a casting credit on the show now.  Okay.  Yeah, she brings him back from New Orleans.  Okay.  I would guess from his body type, it's right after Katrina, and he was starving for about  three weeks.  Oh, sorry.  You look thin.  Where are you from?  Originally Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Close enough.  Baltimore.  I was born there.  The Wire territory?  Oh, I love that, Joe. 
[03:04:30]  You like it?  Baltimore.  Baltimore.  I love The Wire.  Yeah, me too.  The Wire rules.  I have it on the DVD for the playing back.  Oh, very cool.  What season?  I think four.  Okay, good.  I'm up to the kids.  The end of season one, finally.  Good.  Finally.  Season one's still my favorite.  Oh, amazing.  Yeah, season one is still my favorite.  Really?  Yeah.  Cool.  All right, we'll just sit here and talk about other shows.  Let's do that.  That's great.  Let's do that.  It all intermingles.  Maybe you'll have somebody from The Wire on.  Maybe a Michael Kenneth Williams, now that he's dead. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, come on your show.  Make sure you guys watch Quarter Life tonight at 10 on NBC and then Sunday at 9 p.m., which  is our normal time slot.  Why are they starting at 10 tonight and not why they should give the big push, right?  They have this big push tonight.  They have this two-hour Biggest Loser that's supposedly going to get big ratings and they're  going to promo the hell out of it and then they'll have us.  I love the Biggest Loser, so.  Yeah.  You know, so I'll-  There you go.  Well, I can't watch it tonight because it's too late.  But I'll DVR it.  DVR it.  No, we go to bed at like 9.  Go on, please.  I can't go watch it on our website.  All right, let's do that. 
[03:05:30]  Quarterlife.com.  Quarterlife.com.  You guys got to go?  It's cool.  I'm off to The View.  Oh.  Excuse me.  Pretty much the same thing, right?  The View.  Can you do me a favor?  When you see Whoopi, this is true, tell her the Opie and Anthony show agrees that she should  not have been snubbed at that Oscar mention the other night.  We are very irritated that she was snubbed.  The what?  They didn't-  They were showing a montage of Oscar hosts, and they didn't show Whoopi, who hosted us  four times.  Oh.  And she was actually very hurt, and she should have been.  Yeah, she was all choked up on The View.  Why didn't they do that?  Probably because they're racists. 
[03:06:00]  That's my guess.  That's unbelievable.  But we wanted to-  But they didn't have Steve Martin either, right?  Yeah, but he's known to associate with black people, and I think that's a problem they  have with him, too.  Have you seen that?  I just think that they had a problem with Whoopi Goldberg for some reason.  Well, they didn't have him because he remade the Pink Panther, and they can't acknowledge  the fact that he would actually do that to Peter Sellers.  No, don't show him at all.  Humiliate himself.  Hollywood is funny, Steve, with the mustache.  Don't you agree some comedy should never be remade?  Caddyshack.  Yes.  Pink Panther.  Of course.  They're perfect.  Absolutely. 
[03:06:30]  They remake Caddyshack?  Yeah, they called-  They did?  They called it Who's Your Daddy.  Yeah, Black, Black.  Who's your Caddyshack.  I agree.  And that's the other thing Hollywood's doing, is the black version of very classic things.  Like the Honeymooners.  The Honeymooners.  Yeah, that was a shame.  Guess who's coming to dinner?  They remade.  Wait, did they?  They did, that's right.  In the other direction.  It was one of my favorite movies.  The biggest disaster was The In-Laws.  Remaking The In-Laws.  Oh, yeah.  Peter Falk was a genius in that freaking thing.  I love that film.  What's his name?  Alan Arkin.  Alan Arkin.  Alan Arkin, right?  Yeah.  Alan Arkin was great, and Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross. 
[03:07:00]  I don't want to steal the leads.  No?  All right.  I love that.  Sorry.  Have you ever seen The Russians Are Coming?  The conversation stopper.  Huh?  You ever see The Russians Are Coming from the 60s?  Yes.  Emergency.  Everybody.  Everybody will get from streets.  Streets.  Yeah.  Whitaker Walt.  I love that film.  Do we have a clip of Roland getting up the ass?  Oh, do they have to?  Oh, for heaven's sake.  How long is the clip?  Her reason for this.  She's got to go to the view.  I really fast.  I know, right?  This is the reason why you guys came on the show.  We had a great time.  Yeah.  It worked out in the end, but this is truly the reason why. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  You have to put your head in front of the ass.  And then we...  Don't mess up your hair, though.  Put it near your ears.  Yeah.  Just hold them near you.  Although you do have your hairstylist.  Yeah, you'll be okay.  Yeah, that's right, Jeremy.  All right, we're ready.  This is truly what Roland had to do to get you guys on the show.  All right, here we go.  Yeah, don't show us the top of your head.  All right, this is...  We love getting the reaction shot.  All right, Dr. Steve.  If you can't see the camera while you're getting a finger up your ass, the camera can't see you  getting a finger up your ass.  All right.  Remember that.  Are you doing the testicle first?  All right, he's moving up now.  And there he goes.  It's going in.  It's going in.  Watch that face.  It's going in right now. 
[03:08:00]  Oh.  Stay out of the way.  Here we go.  Are you ready?  Oh, it looks like a...  One eye.  One eye.  He's turning into pops.  Roland, how is it?  Roland?  Perfect.  Absolutely normal.  How was that?  Roland?  It was the most awkward thing ever.  I'm going to go home and take a shower.  His ass is a little big, so I can only get in about one knuckle.  Oh, wow.  But it was enough. 
[03:08:30]  And I've got long fingers, but it was enough to feel you got a totally normal prostate.  There you go.  And it was a real doctor, by the way.  Real doctor.  I hope so.  No, it actually wasn't.  It was the guy that played Trapper John.  We had Wayne Rodgers in.  It was all on the up and up, that jam.  On the up and...  Yeah.  All right, well, thank you.  Quarter life.  Yes, thank you.  She's going to leave on that note.  She'll never be back, unfortunately.  Quarter life tonight.  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  NBC.  And then when is the new time?  You can go to quarter life.com.  Sunday.  Sunday's at 9.  Sunday's at 9 for another five weeks. 
[03:09:00]  You guys were fun, man.  I'm happy you came in.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  You're terrific.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Marshall Herskovitz.  Herskovitz.  And Bitsy Tulloch?  Tulloch.  Tulloch.  Sorry.  From quarter life.  Great.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Quick break.  Take care.  Bye, guys.  We'll continue.  All right, buddy, run.  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  Oh, that sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled. 
[03:09:30]  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is it?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wow.  We got to head out soon.  Yeah.  And don't bitch.  We gave you 45 extra minutes yesterday.  It all works.  Oh, my God, did we?  It all works out in the end, doesn't it? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  It's like, you know, an average on the week, I would say.  Oh, my God.  Did I just ask a question?  O.P.  As does it work out in the end?  Does it?  Black CC!  Black CC!  Copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's put a poll.  Poll.  What do you think?  Does it work out in the end?  Oh, my God.  Don't forget about the poll, of course.  We created this monster.  Oh, I know.  This proactive thing. 
[03:10:30]  We created it, and now it's like our worst enemy.  Is it their worst?  All right.  Copy, paste, complicit, complicit.  Gary Coleman on the Today Show.  We can do that.  I want to find out what that was all about, because his freakish wife.  Yeah.  Does Ronnie B, the great Ronnie B, acknowledge that Black Earl is...  Incompetent?  Stupid?  Well, he acknowledges all that.  That's all the obvious stuff.  Useless.  Yeah.  But has he acknowledged that Gary Coleman is the mini version? 
[03:11:00]  Mini Black Earl.  I don't know.  Has he gone down that road yet?  I don't know.  Oh, that would be interesting to see both of them together in kind of a mini-me thing.  Yeah.  Have Gary Coleman dress up exactly like Earl, only in little black clothes.  Well, I think we've got to start with a side-by-side comparison, and then we'll go from there.  I see it in the face, definitely.  Earl doesn't even acknowledge us anymore.  Nope.  No.  Hello.  Hello. 
[03:11:30]  I'm Earl.  Hello.  I don't know.  Hello.  Oh, fuck you.  He gets mad.  All right.  He did that, too.  All right.  I'm trying to find something good.  You cleaning house?  He did all this stuff.  This is all...  Really?  This is good?  No, there was something else that we really did want to do today.  The...  What was it?  There was one more story left over from today. 
[03:12:00]  Funny.  Hey, did we ever do the potty talk?  I don't think so.  Okay.  What's funny?  Just...  Earl is...  Did I ever acknowledge Earl as...  And then I just got an answer that I shouldn't say on the air.  Oh, okay.  Stupid.  I didn't.  Fucking funny.  Boy, man.  That bore fest just took all the air out of ourselves, didn't it?  Oh, no!  Oh, I'm full of piss and vinegar here. 
[03:12:30]  Ready to roll.  Oh, my God.  Who gives a shit about your show?  Oh, my God.  Don't say that.  What?  I like that.  I'm just joking.  Just trying to make everyone uncomfortable.  He was cool as hell, man.  Pretty cool.  I like that guy.  Yeah, bullshit.  Fuck this.  He understood the whole thing.  Yeah.  There's a look with Hollywood girls.  Isn't there a look with girls that are on TV?  They all look like they've been pink-socked. 
[03:13:00]  No.  No.  They got these eyes like this, like, whoa, that wasn't supposed to go in there.  Think about that the next time you see a Hollywood actress.  When you see a Hollywood actress live...  You see too much of the whites of their eyes, which means something went in the back door.  They're crazy?  Oh, or something went out.  No, there's, like, something kind of...  I don't know what it is.  Like, I guess it's their stylists and hair people and all that, makeup and crap.  They kind of have that look that you kind of know they're Hollywood. 
[03:13:30]  I don't know.  I don't know how to put it.  What, do you want us to do 15 minutes on that?  Jesus.  You know, right when I was saying it, I was like, why the fuck?  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, Anthony, I agree with you.  Hey, if you agree with me, give us a call here at the station.  We'll let you...  How many times does one of us start down one of these roads and you're thinking to yourself,  what the fuck are we supposed to do with that? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, every day.  Like, what kind of fodder was that?  You know, you ever notice when you get a book, I mean, sometimes the glue in the bike,  it's not as gluey, quote unquote, as other books you've had.  Your thoughts, callers, go.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm fun at that movie today, man.  That's supposed to be a big...  Hey, why aren't you going?  Why am I not going?  Yeah.  I don't feel like seeing it.  Why?  Because I don't feel like seeing it.  That's why.  Well, you don't feel like seeing it?  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to.  Well, you know something...  You want to not show up?  You want to not come in?  Out of principle, if Jim Norton doesn't show up, then I'm not showing up. 
[03:14:30]  Stop.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  You agreed to this one.  I certainly did.  There might be some beautiful girls there.  Beautiful girls.  I'm going for a movie.  Are you bringing someone?  No, I'm not bringing anybody.  Are you?  A boy or a girl?  I'm bringing my girl.  You are?  Yeah.  Bring in Lindsay.  Let's double date.  Can she sit in the middle?  I have someone to talk to. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I'm bringing my fucking Cialis hard-on and my corduroys while my girlfriend sleeps.  That's a bad combo.  A hard-on and corduroys, man.  That's wonderful.  I remember those days from fucking...  Mine's cool, right?  See the thing moving across like a snake eating a mouse.  Chasing it.  Just go from side to side as you're walking down the hallway.  All right.  Why don't we do this?  You know, go-to material it's called.  News Anchor Flubs. 
[03:15:30]  The store took more than a year to build and has more than 200,000 square feet.  And it employs more than 400 employees.  Reporting live from the newest Walmart in the Shreve City Shopping Center, Jonathan McCall.  KSLA News 12.  Be careful with that one.  That's one of those words you don't want to mispronounce.  Don't want to fuck up.  Oops.  Accidentally, Jonathan.  Thank you.  We'd like to pass this along.  Don't forget to join us.  Yeah, you filled in the gap.  I know you got the joke.  Don't forget to join us this Friday. 
[03:16:00]  Thanks for fucking pointing it out, douchebag.  No kidding.  Let it go.  He barely said shit.  He did say shit.  Did you think?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That was pretty funny, though.  Yeah.  And then the guy's got to point out that he said shit.  Because he's a veteran news anchor dude.  And he's hoping to be discovered by a bigger city.  That's cute.  But we don't tolerate that here in Kansas City, Missouri.  Yes, we have here on the number two train the number of baby cunts. 
[03:16:30]  The number two train.  Did I say baby cunts?  Oh, you got to watch that word.  Because sometimes it'll slip out.  Baby cunts.  Hey, what is this thing about Kansas City?  I hope you were saying, Althea, about Voss's shows?  I don't know, Jimmy.  We're looking into it.  But I don't want to say anything just in case it's not true.  Oh, if it's not true.  And then they're going to not show it when they, whatever.  We're getting to the bottom of something.  Okay.  Hey, Ope, what happened to the code for the shit products versus the good ones you guys promote? 
[03:17:00]  We really want to come up with some kind of code word that would kind of slip in very subtly  where people know that we pretty much have a gun to our head and we have to promote something  we really don't want to promote because they got a nice buy.  A secret message.  Yeah, it's called the buy in the biz.  Yeah.  They got a nice buy, so have Ope and Anthony talk about this product.  How about Hunk of Shit?  We slip that into the copy somehow.  That's a little too veiled.  No one will get it.  Is it?  How about this? 
[03:17:30]  Hullabaloo.  The word hullabaloo.  Hullabaloo.  I'm working on a, I'm working on a new bit.  Uh, I'm going to, well, it's a very simple one.  I shouldn't like, uh, give it too much, uh, credit, credence.  But, um, I want to ask every person that comes in now when they're like in a movie, if they're  hoping for an Oscar nomination.  Hmm.  No matter what the movie is.  Oh yeah.  Like even the worst movie.  When it's obviously a Hollywood, one of those crappy Hollywood comedies and all that just.  How about this?  How about we all have one question we ask every single person? 
[03:18:00]  Mine's going to be that.  Well, how about you, you also say that you've heard rumors.  You've heard there's been talk of a possible Golden Globe or something.  Like people are saying Golden Globe.  The Oscar is crazy.  How about, yeah, Golden Globe.  Yeah, but you say you've heard it and these, let's see how many of these idiots are actually  like, well, you know, I mean, it was really a good role for me.  You know, if, uh, you know, the people like it.  I get no stupid.  Yeah.  Uh, code word.  This is fabulous.  Uh, fast ready.  Huh?  I can't say fabulous. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  So that's your question.  Hold on.  Fabulous.  Your question is, do you want me for an Oscar?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What's your question?  Let's see.  The movie.  They, they, they sit down and go, are you hoping, um, I have nothing.  Hoping for a sequel.  I was like, oh, that's a good one.  Okay.  Did someone come up with that?  I don't want to.  Hoping for a sequel.  No, I don't think, I think I finally came up with something on my own.  Awesome.  I get a question.  Mark the day.  Yes.  So, um, you ever lay down with a color? 
[03:19:00]  Lay down.  You ask him that.  Oh, that's good.  White, black, Spanish.  It doesn't matter.  Black, I would go, what?  That's great.  Just say that.  Hey, uh, uh, Doug in Arkansas, I, I completely agree.  He writes, if you get the stars in the movie, it's shit.  If you get the main guy, it usually means it's shit.  Because if it's a really good movie, the main guy does, like, the big, uh, the heavy lifting. 
[03:19:30]  He goes on Letterman.  He goes on Leno.  He does the Today Show.  Yep.  So, usually when we get the big stars, it's because the, the product, uh, needs a lot  of help.  That's a, that's a good point.  Uh, well, remember who we got for Poseidon?  Richard Dreyfuss.  Richard Dreyfuss.  Right.  And that movie kind of.  We had fucking Richard Dreyfuss in the studio.  Yeah.  How amazing is that?  He was good.  Hey, uh, coin cleavage, coin cleavage has been postponed because you, you broads aren't willing 
[03:20:00]  to come in here and have change dumped on your, uh, chests.  On your tits.  You'll gape your asshole, but you won't, uh, let us pour coins on your chest.  What the fuck is that about?  We got like 10 girls for the, uh, the cherry darts thing where they had to spread their  assholes wide open for us, but, uh, coin cleavage, which is pretty innocent.  I don't even think you have to be topless.  The girls don't want to do that one.  What the fuck?  And, and there was a lot of money up for grabs.  And basically the girl that holds the most, uh, coins gets all the other coins that are 
[03:20:30]  spilled on the floor.  And I was, uh, perusing, uh, rate my wow.  Right.  And, uh, there are some girls on there that have tits that could actually be shaped into  gunny sacks.  It looks like they could actually hold shit.  Yeah.  Uh, in these horribly flappy, droopy, saggy child chewed out tits.  Yeah.  Uh, you could win some money.  Right.  Hmm.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[03:21:00]  How about, are you suggesting we raise a generation of super kids?  We're already doing that with everybody, but Hey, and here's the other thing.  Good news.  The first, um, the first piece of the old puzzle, $2,500 for animation contest.  Wow.  That's good, but I want better.  Cool.  Who's giving up the $2,500?  All right.  Yes.  Dig deep.  What do you got then?  How much?  Who's giving up the $2,500 for the, uh, for the cartoon fest stock to anime bash palooza 
[03:21:30]  cartoonamania.  Who's giving up the $2,500, Steve?  To be determined.  Steve is frazzled today.  Poor guy.  But your sick voice went away, huh?  Um, $2,500.  Yeah, it's gone.  Oh my God.  The $2,500 is, uh.  Who is it, Steve?  Who is it?  The $2,500 is courtesy of XM right now.  Who's giving it out, Steve?  Who's the sponsor?  He's so annoyed.  Who's the sponsor, Steve?  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot do. 
[03:22:00]  Come on, spit it out.  He's not even looking at us.  Yes.  And do not throttle the shit out of the person to my immediate right.  He basically wants to strangle someone.  I love this.  I'm trying to beat, beat the matter.  Oh, he sat down.  That means it's time for therapy with Steve.  All right.  All right.  So what are we talking about?  $2,500.  He's laying back.  $2,500 to give away, which is great.  $2,500.  Who's sponsoring?  Who's giving it away?  Come on, spit it out.  Okay.  No sponsor?  XM is just throwing $2,500.  XM will pony up to $2,500 if we can't find a sponsor.  All right.  We have pricing on the wristbands. 
[03:22:30]  And we're looking into a price on the venue that you asked for.  And somebody brought up a good point.  He's like, you know, if we're not part of your tiny little O&A community and we live  somewhere else, what about wristbands for us?  So somehow we'll, you know, maybe mail some wristbands to some other folks or something  if we can.  We got to figure it out.  We can.  We'll figure it all out.  This is in its early stages, but we're very excited about this animation contest.  We got $2,500.  I want the prize money up to at least five Gs there, Steve.  And I want other things possibly in there.  I want to give out a lot of prizes. 
[03:23:00]  I want this to be an extravaganza.  We're not calling it an extravaganza.  No.  We want it to be an extravaganza.  And what kind of venues are we looking at?  So far, we got Hard Rock Johnny.  I guarantee that.  Beacon-sized venues.  Check the garden.  We want a couple thousand people at this stage.  Check Giant Stadium.  I want Giant Stadium in March.  Yeah.  Get it.  Make it happen.  What is this?  Book it.  Book it.  What is this?  The XFL?  Jimmy?  Jesus.  Oh.  Hey, so, but that's good.  We got $2,500 so far. 
[03:23:30]  We're looking at the USB wristbands because after the animation contest, we want to spread  this material around to people.  So we're going to hand out the wristbands after the show for everyone in attendance because  we might have to charge some money for this.  Hopefully, they leave the venue with something in return.  Yeah, those wristbands aren't cheap.  I checked a few prices online.  I think they're like three or four bucks a piece.  Okay.  That ain't bad.  Yeah, but for a beacon-sized theater...  That's a lot of motherfucking money, Steve!  Exactly.  Well, wake Will up from his hangover and tell him to start getting some sponsors for this 
[03:24:00]  to pay for half this shit.  He said he's got several that would be on board with this.  All right, very good.  We're very excited about this animation contest, and we got an...  Did you fart?  No.  Steve, we got to announce a winner from the other contest?  Yeah, we still haven't picked one from the other contest.  All right, we'll have the winner tomorrow.  What's up?  Those are three to four dollars.  So we can get...  We can get all the animation on a three to four dollar fucking...  Disgusting.  Yeah.  That's amazing, man.  That's fucking amazing.  Yeah.  It's only going to be about...  Stench comes out of your asshole. 
[03:24:30]  It's only going to be about 45 to an hour of material on there, so I think we can get  that done.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Q-Point made us stinky.  All right.  Animation winner from that dumb contest that was poorly executed.  We'll give the winner tomorrow, but the animation contest is officially continuing.  And this is all I ask for from the creative people out there.  Hold back your work.  Don't start putting it on websites.  I want it to be a nice big surprise when we're all at the Beacon Theater seeing it for 
[03:25:00]  the first time.  So try not to spread it around until the contest is over.  That's right.  And then we'll put it everywhere for you, because we all want to be surprised.  You're obviously going to have to submit it to us so we can pick the better ones, but  we want the audience to be very surprised, okay?  And we'll let the people know.  How about this?  For everyone who gets picked, first class airfare in a hotel suite.  Get on us, Steve.  All right.  So we need a venue, and we need an official date.  We're looking at...  Mid-April.  Mid-April.  Mid-April.  So it gives it a solid month and a half at this point. 
[03:25:30]  Do we want to do it on tax day?  No.  That's April 15th.  We can make it a whole taxing animation taxing.  Oh, I suck.  All right.  So that's good.  This is moving along, Steve.  You'll have more info tomorrow?  Yes, I will.  Every day I want an update on this, please.  All right.  Because we haven't been out there doing anything.  This is a good one for us.  Well, all right.  So hold on.  Why don't we look at it starting this thing?  Stop with the farting.  What's the matter?  I took some Metamucil.  Metamucil in the house.  Metamucil in the house. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  We got another.  Oh, God.  Jimmy's stinking up the whole room.  I took Metamucil yesterday.  I can't help it.  That scrapes your shit walls.  Oh, God.  Metamucil is God.  I just picked up the orange flavored.  That's what I got.  I love the orange flavored.  Dude, it's fucking like a little...  It's God's fingernail scraping your colon walls.  Get the smooth texture.  Oh, you don't go smooth texture.  That's for fucking...  It's for rookies, man.  I like a fucking gravelly one.  It gets in there all the nooks and crannies.  You want it to feel like a mini Freddy Krueger is going through your...  Yeah, I want those walls clean. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, another flub.  Line of the day.  Out of here to go see semi-pro.  Free corn dogs, too.  That's fun.  A 1,000 footer lake freighter has bottomed out.  The bulk freighter was on its way to its winter berth located on the superior side of the Duluth  Harbor.  Julie Pierce is on the scene and she's here now with details.  Julie.  Good evening, Michelle.  This ship is one of those 1,000 foot shitters that ships that you often will see out in the  harbor during the summertime and during the shipping season. 
[03:27:00]  It was built over three years ago.  Why would you continue?  I would just be like...  Did she lose her mind?  I would just be like, did I just say shitter on live TV?  Shitter.  A 1,000...  Oh, imagine the cock you put in there.  I'll go!  I did impressions.  Keep that close.  We'll replay that one.  That's a good one.  Very nice.  Shitter.  That's a good one.  Shitter.  1,000 foot shitter.  You need a big cock to make her yell.  Hey, there's a panic going on in the animation world. 
[03:27:30]  A lot of chatter among the animators.  They're wondering if CokeLogic is going to be eligible for this contest.  I say yes!  XM has to figure out that loophole because technically XM pays CokeLogic, but you got  to let him in.  He started this phenomenon.  You got to let the guy in.  He started the whole animation thing, I believe, with Warner Brothers back in the day.  Yeah, back in the 30s.  Back in the 30s.  He first started animating for Warner Brothers and Bugs Bunny, I believe. 
[03:28:00]  Didn't even look like him.  Little known fact about CokeLogic, he animated the colors.  What?  Oh, you mean from black and white to the color?  No, he animated the colors.  Oh, okay.  I was trying.  I was really trying.  Yeah.  His stuff has been banned in 38 states, but he was the one that animated the colors.  I crack myself up sometimes.  Oh, God.  Line of the day is brought to you by some fucking website. 
[03:28:30]  No.  What?  They tell you which one.  Oh.  That's a boy, Stan.  Well, we just straighten the shitter.  Let's go to a runner-up line of the day.  Now, we do have a spokesman from an American Airlines statement from an American Airlines spokesman  Did she just come popping out of the baggage thing?  Oh, God.  Like, how do they do that?  Oh, that would be horrible.  The family's crying as thud. 
[03:29:00]  You have to look outside the plane window and see her being offloaded roughly.  Samsonite thrown on her.  Still in the sitting position.  That's terrible.  Is that our body?  Check the tag.  That was nice.  We all had a little piece of that.  Yeah.  Remember when it used to be Line of the Day?  Yeah.  Really?  Now it's just replay part of the show of the day. 
[03:29:30]  Thingy.  Here comes 20 minutes of the day.  20 minutes of the day.  Thank you, website that is promoting Line of the Day.  That's good, right?  No.  Why is that bad?  There's so many websites, Opie.  Well, pick one.  My personal favorite, skicoloradonow.com.  Really?  Yeah.  Who are they?  Suck up.  Yeah.  Brown nose!  Contract honorer. 
[03:30:00]  Do you really want to know why, Opie?  Because I thought you might have known why.  Why?  They're such a great website.  Oh, who gives a crap.  All right.  I do want to ski.  I thought about that the other day.  Yeah.  Metamucil is like Opie trying to find the G-spot.  That's Charlie, lingering longerer.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Oh, my God.  That's not that.  That's the North American fat-bellied zilch.  It flutters in a circle around the Boston Harbor. 
[03:30:30]  Goes nowhere.  Unless it's under the wings of the giant Dane bird.  For those of you that may have missed it, it was Bob Kelly.  I was scared.  Of course.  We didn't do much on Anthony's prom date today.  I'm a little bummed about that.  What's the way we get to it tomorrow?  Can we get a hotline set up so the girls could call and maybe promote themselves and all  that?  I don't want to ask Steve because he looks like he's going to fall down any moment at 
[03:31:00]  this point.  Well, what if we had a special phone line the girls call?  Can they just use the FU line?  Yeah.  Make it easy for everybody?  All right.  You got the FU line, but we're also going to use that phone number for the girls out  there that are hoping Anthony goes to the prom with them.  Uh-huh.  Just remember the one rule you have to put out.  That's right.  In the S.  Put out.  Anthony has to be able to pink sock you.  Oh, yeah.  We're on this side of the show.  That's right.  This isn't a...  What he's going to do is this.  He's going to pull that fat cock out of your ass at such speed. 
[03:31:30]  Your asshole is going to window shade back.  How did you fucking talk?  Your asshole is going to snap back like a fluttering window shade.  Oh, my God.  And you have to get out of the car and go back up and see your parents with your asshole  hanging out in the back of your dress like a fucking aardvark nose.  Like an anteater's in the back of your fucking dress.  It's the only stipulation for the contest.  That's all we ask, right?  A bleeding fucking pink anteater nose.  I don't think that's going to work out very well. 
[03:32:00]  So, potential dates, start calling the F.U. line and tell us a little something about  yourself, where your high school is.  What do you think?  What?  You honestly think that's going to happen?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Something about skiing.  The lines of the day.  This website's...  Oh.  I figured this much out about this, SkiColoradoNow.com.  Yeah.  I believe it's a skiing website.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  What are we up to live today? 
[03:32:30]  It's great.  You're going to get all kinds...  What?  Why don't you say something about it?  It's a skiing website.  It's SkiColoradoNow.com.  SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  26th World Class Resort.  Shh.  What?  We shot it in London on this island called the Isle of Man, where I was the only black  man on the island.  Really?  Why is that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, it was kind of crazy.  I walked down the street, and people would look at me like a unicorn.  You know what?  I hate the Opie and Anthony from two hours ago. 
[03:33:00]  Why?  Oh, if I could go back, I'd punch certainly myself in the face.  I would have punched me for not saying what I wanted to say.  Exactly.  Opie and Anthony from two hours ago, they suck.  Because the joke was, what's the name of the place?  Yes, Jim Norton should have said, well, how would one get tickets for this island called  Utopia?  I was going to say Paradise.  But I didn't.  But I didn't either.  I just did a weak DreamWorks joke.  It was a unicorn. 
[03:33:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  That one flopped.  I'm a unicorn ball is what I am.  The best we came up with was, why is that?  Why is that?  Hopefully, you'll make the funny black joke, because we're too scared of doing ourselves.  Instead of, yeah.  What a wonderful place this island is.  Right.  Yes.  Sergeant G from Iraq.  Yeah, Opie.  I'm sure you need a hotline dedicated entirely to teens that want to get their assholes deep  dick by Anthony on prom night. 
[03:34:00]  I think this bit has potential.  I really don't.  It does not.  I really don't.  You're probably just safe giving out your home number.  1-800-ASSFUCK.  That's seven letters.  Oh, my God.  Brian from St. Louis.  I apologize to the ladies in advance, but Brian writes,  Ant's going to cunt punch some chick with his large Italian sausage.  You motherfuckers.  Holy shit. 
[03:34:30]  I don't think this innocent prom thing is going to work out.  Oh, I came up with another idea yesterday.  No, it's weird.  I got to tell you guys something.  The fact that Dan's trying to wrap the show up, and we're just going on and on?  They can't start the movie without us, Dan.  Don't you understand that?  Well, they will.  They will?  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  I'll tell you what's weird tomorrow.  All right.  Something to do with this radio show that after three years and four months, 
[03:35:00]  I decided to start doing radio again.  Oh.  That's weird.  Actually, I'm starting to write down ideas and stuff again.  All right.  See how that works.  We'll give that a whirl.  We'll see if that helps the show.  I don't know.  But no, really fast, I want to do a feedback show very soon.  Yeah?  Just a show that is based on just feedback. 
[03:35:30]  You guys can be part of it, or you guys go home, and I'll just do it for an hour.  I want to do a feedback show.  Instant feedback?  Yeah, that's all it is.  We come in here with nothing in front of us and just go, duh.  All right.  So you want to do a show tomorrow or Thursday.  All right.  And then we look at the feedback, and they got an idea or something, and we go with that.  And then we move on to something else, and then we just work off the feedback for an entire hour or two.  Not a whole show.  That would be crazy.  But maybe for an hour.  The feedback show coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program.  Here's your line of the day. 
[03:36:00]  We've got to get out of here.  Right to commercial.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  He's suffering from a...  I took a lozenge.  He's suffering from a dented tonsil.  Is that it?  That's right.  I had a hip in each hand.  I couldn't control it. 
[03:36:30]  2015.  Wow.  This is radio, and it's most fascinating.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the worst radio I've ever heard.  Ah-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  It's fucking boring.  It's hard to be a good listener in general,  but to try to listen to this...  You better off jerking up into a napkin  and crying yourself to sleep.  Trust me, kid. </pre>
