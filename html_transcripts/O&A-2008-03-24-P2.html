<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a scathing critique of Colin Quinn's song "Going Back to Brooklyn," which the hosts relentlessly mocked for its perceived poor quality.  This was followed by comedian Adam Ferrara's shocked and disgusted reaction to the "Two Girls One Cup" video.

The main event of the show was an in-studio interview with George Carlin.  Their conversation covered Carlin's early radio career, the evolution of radio, the decline of American society, political correctness, the absurdity of modern life, and the sensationalized nature of modern news reporting. Carlin shared anecdotes about his career, including his experiences with radio consultants and the pressures of political correctness.  The hosts and Carlin engaged in humorous exchanges about various societal issues and media.  A brief segment afterward discussed a poster of comedians associated with the show, mentioning Lewis Black’s appearance and segueing into a discussion about Rudy Giuliani's hypocrisy regarding his public moral stance versus his private life.

Lewis Black then joined the show in-studio.  The conversation ranged from Timothy McVeigh's execution and the death penalty (including a graphic description of Iranian stoning), to a Vermont senator's party switch and criticisms of U.S. energy policy (mentioning Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton).  A significant portion of this segment was dominated by Black's frustrated attempts to tell a story about a charity event with Kathy Lee Gifford and a paraplegic singer, Gracie, constantly interrupted and derailed by Opie and Anthony’s jokes.  Gracie was described as a paraplegic singer who performs inspirational songs and participates in extreme sports, though the specifics of her performance and interaction with Gifford remained unclear due to the interruptions.  The segment was marked by playful antagonism and vulgar language. Later, Dane Cook joined the broadcast, sharing anecdotes about his Madison Square Garden shows, his tour with Bob Kelly (including a humorous account of Kelly breaking his knee and listener-created remixes of his pained cries), and his experiences with different audiences.  He also discussed his new CD/DVD *Retaliation*, awkward corporate gigs, and unsolicited advice.  A caller shared a positive experience at a Cook and Kelly show.  The segment concluded with playing these audio clips, a short snippet of Martha Stewart rapping with P. Diddy, and further tour stories, including Kelly needing a pedicab to a show.  Bill Burr’s HBO special was also mentioned.

Patrice O'Neal's highly theatrical entrance to the studio followed, marked by his frustration with the show's security guard, "Master Poe," whose excessive security measures were described in detail.  The conversation shifted to Patrice’s experiences in Brazil (involving graphic descriptions of sex and sex toys, some of which he brought to the studio), loneliness, relationships, and his self-described "sexual deviancy." Opie also shared details of his recent breakup.  The Hot 97 radio controversy surrounding a racist song parody and a potential connection to a former Opie and Anthony producer were also briefly touched upon.

Mark Maron joined the show, discussing his recent cigar smoking, his unexpected and brutal divorce (attributing it to his anger issues), and his experiences with unhelpful couples counseling.  He openly discussed his anger issues and the emotional impact of the divorce.  The conversation also touched upon the dynamics of his marriage and his views on China and the future of the United States.  A phone call with Bob Kelly occurred concurrently with Kelly's live TV interview in Boston, where Kelly recounted his appearance on CNN and Spike TV and described an on-air altercation.

A chaotic interview with Bob Kelly followed, focusing on a slapping incident on a Fox 25 news segment with Jay Davis and Gene Levanchi, and numerous references to John Carr. Kelly promoted his website and Myspace. After a short break, Al Franken joined, discussing politics, Bill O'Reilly's hypocrisy, the Bush administration, the Iraq War, the upcoming presidential election, his USO tours (including an anecdote about Sylvester Stallone), and his views on potential presidential candidates (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Rudy Giuliani).

The show concluded with a remote stand-up performance by Rich Voss at a Cleveland diner, hampered by technical difficulties.  The hosts heavily heckled and insulted Voss throughout his set.  Voss promoted his website and Myspace. The show ended with the hosts discussing other comedians they liked (Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, and Colin Quinn), Voss plugging his gigs, and mentioning Metamucil, followed by standard outro announcements and sponsorships.

[00:06:30]  We're fortunate enough to interview a lot of people  With this radio show  And every once in a while  Someone comes through that door  Where we're like starstruck  And a little freaked out  And you're one of those guys  And it's only a handful of times  This has happened over the years  Thank you  Now calm down  Right  We're all obviously huge fans  And we love everything you've done  That's great  I really appreciate it  50 years right?  50 years since I went into radio in 1956  Wow  Top 40 was just starting 
[00:07:00]  Rock and roll was just starting  I was 18  And I had the advantage of having a car down in Shreveport  I was in Shreveport, Louisiana  I was in the Air Force  And I could go out at night  And tell the chick  Hey  You want to hear a song tomorrow?  I'll dedicate it to you  What do you want?  You know  It was magic  Magic man  Two paychecks  Didn't have to do anything on the airbase  Just do my show  That's why  That's just never changed  As far as that goes  That's why  I see it as a way to get girls 
[00:07:30]  That's why most people got into radio  Was for the free CDs  Well free CDs now  Whatever  Free music  And hopefully picking up a few extra women on the side  And trade outs with the sponsors  Right right  Yeah the old plugola  The payola  What was  Radio must have been a hell of a lot different back then than it is now  Did you have freedom to really talk and say what you want?  You didn't have a PD up your  It was the first stage of Top 40  So personalities were still in play 
[00:08:00]  And you had a kind of a persona on the air  And they did set your pictures out  You know and all that  And I was a young guy  So they wanted  You know we had a lot of young listeners naturally  And so they wanted to have like a fan club and all that stuff  And yeah the thing about it was  Our radio station was a day  Dig this  It was a day timer  That is to say it went on the air in the morning  Went off in the sundown  Because that was the way you did it 
[00:08:30]  Some of them  A thousand watt  And we had to gain our audience back every morning  And we had a 52 Hooper in a nine station market  A 52% share of the audience in a nine station  A hot radio market  Shreveport  They had a big CBS station  With Louisiana Hayride  Had a lot of great radio stations  And we were number one  But yeah we had an owner who hated rock and roll  But he played it  But he also played Ray Anthony  And stuff like that  So it was schizophrenic 
[00:09:00]  And you could choose everything you wanted  You know you had 30  Top 30  You had the newcomers  And then you had oldies  And dusty discs and all that  But it was up to you  You know  Yes you can make your own program  You would pick it  And then what about like talking between the records  Absolutely  Get some of your personality in there  It wasn't just time and temperature  And label and artist  Right  It was you talk about whatever you felt like  And you could play around  I used to  Any live spots  I always had fun with them  I would do them in foreign accents  Or I would do them as characters  You know 
[00:09:30]  So yeah  It was a lot of freedom  Yeah  Now  Oof  Yeah  It's a business  Which I think  Ope says it a lot  When he got into it even  You know  It was a bunch of guys  Just kind of  Hanging out  Yeah  Especially FM radio  FM radio  They hired you because  Because you smoked pot  Yeah  No I'm serious  And like the  Album oriented rock stations  In the 70s especially  They hired you because  You were one of the guys  And you would smoke pot 
[00:10:00]  And play whatever the hell you wanted  And then someone  Figured out  Whoa  We can make money off this  That's right  Which turned out to be a bad thing  In the end  They called it underground radio  For a while  Sure  It was underground radio  Underground radio  I used to listen to old air checks  And you hear these guys  They're completely stoned  Looking out  Looking out  I mean you hear it on the radio  They're like  I'm just watching the snow fall  Yeah  They're just completely gone  And this was CMF  I got to listen to some old air checks  And then you fast forward 
[00:10:30]  A mere 10-15 years  And there's consultants  And there's PDs running in  And the general managers  And it's a whole different  You know  Ball game now  They test everything  And they send out hooks  Yeah  They actually have people  Listen to hooks  Yeah  To see which hooks  They don't bother  With the whole record  You like this whole section  Okay  That's a good one  Yeah  If you like two seconds  Of this song  Our station's gonna play it  How ridiculous is that  I know  And I was one of the guys  When I first started radio  I was the guy  That had to play this  Little hook  For people at home 
[00:11:00]  While they were trying to eat  Really?  You did that  I was an intern  And that was my job  Yeah  And I would just  Fudge the results  Because half these people  Would be cursing me out  Saying F you  I'm eating  Don't ever call again  I'm like  All right  They like the song  Is that a yes?  Right on the air  So you know  And the consultants  Would take all this research  Seriously  But they would  Give it to interns  To do  Of course they're not  Gonna work that hard  At doing that  Well it's just  It's just another sign  Of the absolute disintegration  And decay of this country  It's been in its death throes 
[00:11:30]  You know  Since World War II  It's on the way  It's going away man  People think it's  It's going away  If you can't smell that  If you can't see that  You ain't paying attention man  You've said a lot of things  That have been  Really controversial  With some people  And that's  That's one of them  I happen to agree with you  Yeah  I think we're doomed  As a nation  We're going to go down  In history  As one of those  Empires that kind of  Peaked and then  Kind of went away  Overreached  Yeah  Selfish  Arrogant 
[00:12:00]  Ah  And have  And now we have things like  Tequila lollipops  You know  And I counted  In the car wash  About a couple of years ago  By now  I counted  Of all the ways  You could change the smell  In your car  From things you hang  On the window  To beads  To sprays  To  They had several  Delivery systems  For this stuff  I counted  Over 200  Different things  You could do  To change the smell  In your car 
[00:12:30]  And one of them  Was called  New car smell  And  I mean it's over  It's finished  Take a look  You know  One of my favorite things  Is like as the years  Have gone on  You're less good  At hiding your revulsion  For everything  Which is  What's so  It's great  I love it  As it's gone on  It's just gotten  Like just angrier  And just  Less trying to be polite  To them  And just assaulting  The people  That are actually  Sitting in the room  And you know  I want to just  If I may  For a moment  Correct the word 
[00:13:00]  Angry  Even though  It's an understandable  Word to use  When you describe  Some of that stuff  I do  It's really  A disappointment  And a disillusionment  And a contempt  For people  This country  And the human species  Either one you want  To take  The American nation  Or the human species  We were given  Great gifts  This mind  This brain  That we have  As humans  And the wonderful  Gifts in this country  And we have  Squandered them  Made all the wrong  Choices  Organized ourselves  Poorly  Ourselves poorly  We believe 
[00:13:30]  There's an invisible  Man in the sky  Who's running things  And all we want  Is the latest gizmo  We want a cell phone  That'll make pancakes  If we can get that  We're going to be fine  And it's just absurd  And what it is  It's frustration  You know  It's not an anger  You intensify it on stage  And it reads as anger  I know that  But I don't live  An angry life  And I look at this  And it's an amusement  To me  This big world  This big round globe  Is theater in the round  To me  I'm just here for the show  And you've got an outlet 
[00:14:00]  You can go on a stage  And kind of  Spew what you're seeing  Out there  And we have an outlet  We get to do a radio show  And we point out  A lot of stuff  That's going on  You have the immediacy  Going for you  You can get right on it  The next day  I think I would go insane  If I wasn't able  To just go on the radio  And talk about  All the craziness  That's happening around us  I really do  We were talking about the news  And how it has just  Deteriorated from  You know  When I was growing up  As a kid  You'd see Walter Cronkite  On the news  It was a desk 
[00:14:30]  It was a clock  It was Walter  And you pretty much  You pretty much believed him  You know  What he was saying  You felt he wasn't  Trying to pull something  Over on you  Whether he was getting  Accurate information or not  He was just reporting  The news  He never got up  And danced  I never saw him  Get up and dance  He never needed  Flashy graphics  And he never teased  What was coming up next  With some kind of  Deadly disease  Or  There's a toy in your house 
[00:15:00]  That could kill your child  We'll tell you about it  In four hours  As your kid plays with toys  It's just this thing  This business  To get people to tune in  And keep tuning in  It's an entertainment show  I once heard  A 7 o'clock news  Tease that said  A prominent  No it was during  The entertainment hours  It was during prime time  Like 8.30  Something like that  They said  Prominent senator dies  Find out who at 11  You know  I wrote it down 
[00:15:30]  We have to play  Some of these news  Teases for George  I think he would  Really appreciate it  A couple of the  Hall of Fame ones  That we picked  We make fun of  The local news  And they're news  Teases right George  You might want to  Put the headphones on  So you can hear this  Or put them close  To you there  Whatever you want to do  I'm not going to  Tell George Crowley  What to do  This is a good thing  To tell me what to do  Yeah  But what we do  Is we collect  All the news teases  That come into our show  And then we make  A Hall of Fame  Of the best of the best  So far  We've only been doing  This about two years  And I think we got 
[00:16:00]  Like six  We'll play a couple  For you  Like this one  One city wants to  Pack all their sex offenders  Into a three block area  Problem is  It could be right  Next to your house  All the sex offenders  Three block area  Right next door to you  Right next door to you  Three block area  Small city  Right  That's fantastic  And who wants  Who's running  On that platform  Yeah  Like who wants to do that  We will have  The sex offenders  Every one of them  One three block area 
[00:16:30]  That's great  And then we got this one  How a twist on the  Predator law  Could shut down religion  Let's hope so  Yeah  Please  But just one little twist  And that's it for religion  That's it  That's all it's going to take  After all these years  Right  Complete anarchy  Could frequent hiccups  Be a sign of cancer  Watch News 8 and 10  That's on the money  It's always that  Fear of your health  And the music  They got  That's the exorcist music 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  Is it  Like playing underneath  It sounds exactly like  Tubular bells or something  Playing underneath  Yes  We can't get enough of this  George  Here's another one  Are you normal  Thursday at 11 on News 8  Are you normal  Don't go by us  What a set on these  Idiots  Doesn't that sound like  Something from  Kentucky Fried Movie  Or SNL  But it's really the news  Yeah  We only got a couple more  Real fast  Could your house  Be making you fat  Tomorrow  CBS 2 News at 5 
[00:17:30]  We collect these  Like baseball cards  They are just  Too much fun to own  And we take it very seriously  We debate it on the air  Should this one be  In the Hall of Fame  We're not sure  Yes  You know  It takes a lot  To get to the Hall of Fame  And the ingredients  In shampoo  That can make a boy  Develop breasts  Tonight at 10  Give it to the girls  Send them to the neighborhood  With the sex predators  The three block radius  Might as well play it out  We got two more  This one  Go go go  Sex offenders  Maybe in your house  In your house 
[00:18:00]  Especially if you're one  Right  And then finally  The problem solvers  Have uncovered sexual predators  Sent to live in our nursing homes  Do you really know  Who's living down the hall  Could this happen to your mother  Just the thought  You sure  They're not making fun  Of themselves  They've got to be  At this point  Just the thought  Of your mother  Being ravaged  That's pretty much  What they wanted you to get  Your mom's laying  In a nursing home  Barely breathing  And being ravaged  By some predator  By some predator 
[00:18:30]  That you didn't know about  In the hospital  What a great project  When did it happen  It's like  And I talk about  The downfall  Of the society  The whole time  I'm constantly saying  We're doomed  We're doomed  But I don't know  What did it  Is it the nation  As a whole  With getting greedy  Is it just  The leadership  Is it political correctness  The world just opening up  And getting more info  You know  It used to be  Kind of us against the Soviets  But then when  Information started being spread 
[00:19:00]  A little more easily  They kind of figured out  What was going on  I don't know  No  But it's just  It is depressing  And just disappointing  It's kind of entertaining  When you look at it  You know  When you're born in the world  You're given  A ticket to the freak show  When you're born in America  You're given a front row seat  And some of us have notebooks  And that's as simple as that  You and all of us in this room  We have notebooks  And we make little notes  Some of the freaks 
[00:19:30]  Are self-appointed  Michael Jackson  Mike Tyson  Certain ones  Other ones are thrust into it  Leona Helmsley  You know  It's just an interesting  Thing to watch  I mean  From the standpoint  Of personalities alone  But I don't know  I think it's a cascade  You know  Yeah  It builds on itself  And they say  Hey  As you say  It reminds me of a line  From  Fireside Theater  Hey  We can make whiskey  You know  Hey  We can make money  Like you said  Once they find out 
[00:20:00]  There's an extra dollar  Or two to be squeezed out  They do it  Yeah  You have this great  I'm sorry George  You have a great knack  Of taking the way  People are thinking  And just really making you  Doubt your own point of view  Like with voting  It's such a brilliant point  You made  About how people say  Ah you can't complain  If you don't vote  And then you point out  How like  The people that voted  Are the ones that put  These people in office  So you have every right  To complain  Because you're not a part of it  You stayed home that day  Of course I'm complaining  I didn't do this  It wasn't my work  The greatest  The greatest ability 
[00:20:30]  To narrow everything down  To one simple  Beautiful point  Like anorexia  I think it's probably  My favorite thing  You've ever said  Is anorexia  Rich C's  Don't want to eat  F'em  Yeah  I mean what a beautiful  Accurate thing  I had a friend  In my neighborhood  Jack Heaney  We called him Billy Heaney  He was Bill John  And he had that reductionism  He could do that  And I sort of like  Liked that  And I think I must have  Picked some of that up  From him  He had a way  Of looking at something  And really presenting it 
[00:21:00]  To you in bare bones  And of course  He went into a different field  But I was able to use it  In my field  You know  It's just a way of  Not BSing yourself  Looking at the thing  And saying  Hey  Wait a minute  What is this really  Oh yeah  Here's what they're doing  You know  When did stand up  Become so likable oriented too  It's really like  Annoying how they're focusing  So much on people  Being likable  And people being like  A sweet  And kind of cuddly  For an audience  In what respect  Where 
[00:21:30]  Well just like  On television  It seems like  They just want to take  Like the balls  Out of anything  Oh yeah  Especially stand up  Performance wise  Well  I think  Everybody's running  Really scared  And I think  Any voice  That sounds  A little scary  To them  Is going to be  Neutralized  Or compromised  Or you know  Yeah  It's just  It's a  It's a  It's a  It's a stupid  If you're talking  About commercial  Television  Forget it  Commercial anything  I mean that's all 
[00:22:00]  It's all it's about  Is selling goods  All that other stuff  Nothing  The stuff in between  Doesn't mean anything  It's just a delivery  System for  Sales  And  And you're not  Going to get  Anything worthwhile  In between the selling  You've been  Linked to the  FCC  Now  I mean forever  You will be forever  Linked with the  Seven dirty words  Which is now  Seven hundred  But it's gone  It's gone so far  Beyond that now  Because now we don't  Only have to adhere  To FCC regulations 
[00:22:30]  We have to adhere  To nice regulations  We have to  It's political  Correct  Little interest groups  That'll  Like Reverend Al Sharpton  And people that will  Just fire off  Some letterhead  To your boss  And they will then  Give you another  List of words  That you can no longer  Use on the air  This disgusts me  Sure  It completely  Takes the  Takes your  Balls away 
[00:23:00]  You can't do  The show you want to do  No  Once advertising  Is involved  Once the cash register  Comes into play  Everything else  Is subordinated  To that  And has to be  Unfortunately  That's just  What they do  I just think  It doesn't  It would never  Pan out  To where the  Advertiser  Really would have  To worry  Like you say  Something on the air  A group comes up  And says  Alright we're going  To boycott  I would love  For someone to go  Go ahead 
[00:23:30]  Let me see  If this affects  Coca-Cola's  Bottom line  At the end of the year  Let's see how far  This really would go  But they get  So scared  We're talking about  The Ima situation  Obviously  When you do a radio show  You follow the FCC guidelines  You have to  You're going to get fired  And get the company fined  But now  Like Ant said  It's not about that anymore  You have to now  Be nice on the radio  You can't offend  You can't offend  Rutgers basketball player  Woman's basketball player  People think 
[00:24:00]  They have a right  To not have  Their feelings hurt  I know  They actually think  That's a given right  That the forefathers  Wrote in  That said  Your feelings  They can't be hurt  Right  And that is  You could say  Whatever you want  As far as hurting  Someone's feelings  They could come back  At you and say  Something else  But  That's that left wing  Paternalism  Big white  Oh yeah  Big white daddy  Knows best  Yep  That came  You know  Everyone  We all got to  Understand that 
[00:24:30]  We could expect  Censorship from the right wing  Over time  We know that's  Where it's going to come from  But to expect it  From the left wing  From the  Politically correct  People in the campuses  Especially the eastern  Ivy League campuses  That caught me by surprise  I mean isn't that  The guys  The people you grew up with  That were going to  You know  Really change things  And you know  Had this  Freer thinking  And then it just turns out  To be a bunch of 
[00:25:00]  Phonies  Just like you said  Paternalistic  The conservatives  Have always hid behind  Like family values  And religion  And it seems like  What the liberals  Hide behind  Is things like  Hate speech  Like that's how  They get you  To kind of  Not say  What kind of  Smashes their ideology  Yeah  It's  This  This country  Went off the cliff  And it's just  In free fall now  It's just  You know  We're waiting  For the  For the big bang  To happen  And it's so wonderful  What nature is doing  To smack us back  This

[00:29:30]  It's  Just  Whatever  Is  Funny  When I  Was  A  Kid  Yeah  George  Could  Go  Real  Deep  And  Real  Silly  Like  Your  Whole  Thing  On  Moving  And  Stuff  And  That  Whole  I  Love  That  There  Were  Three  Areas  Actually  Four  Areas  Now  That  I  Kind  Of  Draw  From  Language  Itself  Just  For  It's  Own  Sake  Talking  About  Words  And  Phrases  And  Stuff  Words  Hurt  George  We  Had to  Read  A  Pamphlet  Here  To 
[00:30:00]  Our  Radio  Show  A  We  With  The  Political  Correctness  And  Stuff  They  Handed  Out  This  Pamphlet  About  How  Words  Hurt  Called  Words  Hurt  And  We  Had  To  Read  Different  Stereotypes  And  How  They're  Used  And  We  Shouldn't  Use  Them  And  We're  At  A  Point  Now  On  Regular  Radio  Where  I  Can't  Go  Into  Chinatown  And  Speak  To  Somebody  And  Then  Convey  The  Conversation 
[00:30:30]  Here  Using  The  Accent  Of  The  Asian  Gentleman  Because  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  Imitating  The  Guy  To  Any  Other  Store  And  He  Said  Well  That  Shirt  Looks  A  Little  Big  On  You  I  Can  Do  That  But  I  Can't  Talk  About  How  The  Egg  Foo  Young  Isn't  Done  Yet  So  This  Words  Heard  It  The  Pamphlet  We  Read  Every  Word  On  The  Air  And  Made 
[00:31:00]  A  Huge  Joke  Out  Of  And  Then  We  Get  In  Trouble  For  Making  a joke out of it we're like you're gonna drive us insane we can't take this stuff seriously  in in in what we're doing on on our radio show words have become so um yeah so empowered people  have become very very nervous where are the four places you draw from though uh well the english  language um social commentary kind of i think that's the best word for some of that stuff  because it's not political really more like social and um silliness you know uh and um observations 
[00:31:30]  you know like about stuff things things that universalities things we all know and uh and  therefore you have half the job is done with the audience because they already know the premise  and all you have to do is kind of like then take care of business i think i started throwing stuff  away after uh listening to your stuff bit like you know we just collect stuff that just means it's it's  nonsense well if there's an interesting thing about something that someone gives you um you know 
[00:32:00]  you you it's very hard like a year after your aunt gave you a bad looking clock or a dumb thing for a  lamp a year later two years later ten years later it's real easy to be in storage and say get that  out that goes in the big pile over on the left that's going to salvation army or goodwill or whatever  but you you know what's really hard to do throw it away the same day she gave it and it's the same  clock and you feel the same way about it but your conscience won't let you take it and put it in the 
[00:32:30]  dumpster when she leaves the house it's very interesting enough time has to pass and then you  feel okay i can throw this away now you're so right that's really right throw it out with the gift  wrapping still on it that's right yeah say just why don't you meet me in the back meet me back by  the garbage cans when you get to the house because i got on it to make it easy for both of us i throw  stuff away now and people get outraged like you just got that for your birthday my god they they will  never know that i just threw their stuff out i'm not i'm not maybe that's where they're getting this 
[00:33:00]  stuff yeah going through the dumpsters what is what you know what is it about just the passage of  time that makes certain things okay when immediately it's just not i was brought up the um  the titanic you know being just a horrific thing a ship sinks kills thousands and then  yeah you fast forward a few years relatively speaking a blink of an eye and there's a an inflatable  ride at kids parties that is shaped like the titanic sinking into the lawn with a hose and little 
[00:33:30]  kids slide down the deck and it's like now it's a ride and they give you some smokestacks too so  the kids could bounce yeah they could bounce off the smokestacks and you're like this was a horrible  tragedy where people died in horrifically painful ways but enough time goes by and it's a kiddie ride  now and they wonder why it's all ending yeah what's wrong with our country that's why uh after 9-11 
[00:34:00]  uh i i brought up that same thing i go how my how much time has to pass before they have a ride based  on that horrific disaster and uh then people call up hey hey hey what do you say you're sick well  the titanic come on you don't think those people had family friends loved ones that and now it's a  kiddie ride enough time goes by people just seem to want to forget it and it's all different people  yeah yeah all different people and i've also found that um it's okay to show dead people 
[00:34:30]  if they're far away yeah or if it's old in black and white like old world war ii stuff it's fine you  could show japanese people just burned to a crisp from a flamethrower um and you can show dead people  now as long as they're a certain uh a few miles away yeah you can't show them here like they won't  show american dead people in a car wreck or shooting the newscast tells me uh you you you may  this coming the footage we're going to show may be too graphic for you yeah and i you know and i 
[00:35:00]  think not for me what else do you have in there you must have some more i start show me the raw feed  i start licking my chops all right i know you're lying where's the raw feed i don't like that's an  and i you know something else i don't like when these local newscasters say there's a woman in  los angeles and she said after any accident or most accidents the ones that follow the description 
[00:35:30]  i'm going to say right now she'll say well thank goodness no one was hurt and i don't agree with  that i don't like that's an editorial remark save that for the editorial page maybe it's it's good  some people got hurt maybe they're people who deserve to be hurt you know maybe we should have  more people hurt well how who is she to decide this for me yeah tell me what happened lady that's  right i want to know that's why i tuned in here i'll say thank goodness they weren't hurt or good 
[00:36:00]  for him right i hope he's dead yeah they might be horrific people yeah i like getting carlin reports  like once in a while you'll see like a comic that will go to see you as you're working through the  special it's always funny to hear like the things that cause certain people to walk out of the room  and occasionally over the years i've gotten them from people like yeah he was doing this thing on  abortion and some woman screamed f you george and walked out it's funny to know like even you  and as who you are you're still getting this crap on the road occasionally it's funny that people will  buy a ticket who only saw you on the johnny carson show in the 1980s or 60s or 70s or something 
[00:36:30]  there are people who that's why i really don't like las vegas audiences i go there for for sound  reasons for my own um travel i list my markets kind of breathe a little you know i go out 80 90  dates a year that's a lot of every two years i go out to a place and so i like to let them breathe  and i go to vegas to earn some money and um i've always told those audiences and there's three kinds 
[00:37:00]  of people here tonight i come out and i'd say this in the beginning we have three kinds of people we have  we have hardcore fans the kind of people and some of them cheer when you do that hardcore fans the  kind of people that'll drive from buffalo to cleveland to see your show they're fine i said  then you have casual fans people who've seen you a few times and they saw you in college in the 70s  and they've heard a couple of your albums and they're okay with you but they don't really know  what it is you do i said and then there are the schmucks there are the schmucks and the a-holes 
[00:37:30]  i say these are the people who uh one of them is from thailand i'm sorry thai people one of them  is from thailand the other guy has on short pants and and and socks and is scratching his nuts and he  has a coupon and these people if these people are sitting near you don't be influenced by their  reactions please you know i i used to give them a great little about five minute pep talk because  you couldn't trust those audiences they go either way on you aren't they dumb but isn't it there's 
[00:38:00]  nothing more aggravating on stage bombing is acceptable but when you know you're bombing on  content because they object to the content like oh there's nothing that drives jimmy nuts i would  rather just get stared at i respect them staring but i hate when they try to throw there just it's  like an acting job for the rest of the audience yeah yeah yeah no and i don't know why they go out  i don't know why they go out to aggravate you it should be open if you go into a theater of any  kind should be open you should be there for wonderment and a new experience and surprises yeah 
[00:38:30]  things like that not not oh oh i have to leave i can't even be in the same room as it's like you're  physically beating them they can't take the audio that is going into their ears it freaks them out too  much what kind of friggin close-minded ass leaves a room because they're hearing something that  yeah they they don't really like let's go to the phones a lot of people really experience it really  want to talk to george chrissy in jersey what's up we got george carlin in studio 
[00:39:00]  hi i just wanted to say that i love the f word the shit that he does about the f word thank you  i am obsessed with it it's the probably the funniest thing that i've ever seen in my life and  every time like i have a couple of friends over i show the skit to him and it's probably by far the  funniest thing that i've ever seen in my life i love it you sound like a nice group thank you very  very much chrissy what what's that about there george just for the people i think she's talking  about the f please uh no i'm sorry chrissy the f word she said yeah you just do a whole thing on it 
[00:39:30]  yeah different uh yeah it's always funny variations in usage you attack the baby boomers i don't think  anything makes me happier that when you really slug the baby boomers it's just such an accurate  awful and have them in the audience they're such pigs and it's not just a demographic thing it's a  certain type of boomers i mean some guy in rural minnesota who's of that you know age group obviously  doesn't fit the description but the stereotypical baby boomer who was you know all in favor of free 
[00:40:00]  love and peace and and and screw authority who became a banker you know and now is kicking people  out of homes and shit you know what i like i like that uh commercial the retirement commercial now  with um oh who the hell is in it ah uh yeah yeah yeah um the guy was an easy rider yeah  oh fonda hopper no dennis hopper oh thank you dennis hopper is trying to be like cool man and he's  but he's talking about your retirement plan man and how you got to go keyword is dream yeah yeah 
[00:40:30]  they think if they say that they get some in the door all the way right right your dreams didn't die  man yeah your dreams don't retire man come on man and and you're like wait a minute this this is the  guy who was smoking pot and yeah a wild man should have that then pan to an old lady being beaten by a  black orderly by the way uh during the break you were talking to george about uh you know just going 
[00:41:00]  about your life and and seeing stuff and going wow this is why the rest of the world hates us yeah  yeah and and i'm one that like i just kind of skip through life with my shoelaces untied i know i  kind of have a good time i like having fun you enjoy sucking up all our energy and i i drive a  enjoy big cars disgusting gas guzzler i have a sports car that even uses more gas  i don't care i really don't care i'm on a roller coaster ride and i could give a crap if the sun  exploded tomorrow i'd actually feel better about it because i'd get to watch absolutely true you know 
[00:41:30]  that's how i feel that's how i feel about the whole thing but i do understand watching television shows  and seeing things that happen around at least i know what i'm doing uh i see why we're hated by the  rest of the world it's it's some of this reality programming uh things like like you bring up  anorexia uh the news you just watch certain things and go you know we have no clue how  like france and spain uh other countries are looking at us and just going oh malignant narcissism 
[00:42:00]  americans what's that malignant narcissism that's what we were guilty of we're narcissists we see  our own reflection and we were entranced by it well we were the big you know we were the big kahuna  on the block for quite a while and we were pretty much the world's saviors uh keeping everyone safe  from the dreaded commies for so long you can get into the details of a lot of that well i'm talking 
[00:42:30]  about perception here you know it's it's as far as uh especially americans go uh we were raised  thinking oh my god these awful communists are here uh they're taking over the world and and we're the  good guys so when that whole thing came down uh we ended up with no one to really uh have as an  enemy right and i think we really started turning on ourselves yeah then we found then we found the uh 
[00:43:00]  the muslim religion to turn on yeah yeah well win by the way i say that in some of my shows yeah  yeah the muslims are going to win because they're going to out reproduce us they're already doing  that they will definitely have more babies than we do and they don't care you see they have nothing  to lose i learned very early growing up in west harlem you don't necessarily if you have to you have  to but if you don't necessarily get into a fight with some guy who doesn't give up an f a guy a person 
[00:43:30]  who has nothing to lose will always beat someone who has things at home that he wants to protect  always always always always always they don't care they don't care and there's more of them and  they're going to be more and more and more europe is already becoming muslimized that that stuff is  over white race is on its way out we don't even reproduce a replacement rate no we we kind of barely  replace ourselves because we actually think about it sometimes they go can i afford this is this well 
[00:44:00]  my career is a little more important how many kids can i afford you know college costs are so high i  guess we could do two i really wanted five or seven yeah i agree with you because i i yeah because it's  it's a long game we look at it as like uh this generation yeah right this they're in for the long  haul man that's right they're in for the long time is on their side and we're so anxious to look at  the next quarterly dividend the next quarterly dividend they could wait a thousand years 
[00:44:30]  folks that some of you are going to be alive to feel the blade  it's going to be wonderful they certainly can wait a few hundred years yeah because especially in  america everything is uh add everything is instant gratification oh yeah they don't think on that  level they're like we'll take our time here what do we got got some sand you got a little fire going  okay man we're good for another hundred years yeah we'll wait this one out as they're concerned  about getting their latest phone that cooks pancakes like you said that's right yeah and 
[00:45:00]  rubs you nuts man i thought the exact same thing i'm like these guys are going to win because they're  not about this generation again about getting it done right now right this is a long-term thing doomed  we're just doomed you uh you ever regret going after anything or no like anything you went after  that you're like i shouldn't have no i've never i don't remember ever feeling like that no no i  sometimes i wish i had uh done some things extra you know some some i wish i had thought even harder  about something because i hear people like that so much why didn't i get put more work into that you 
[00:45:30]  know that kind of feeling but nothing on the other direction no good and uh well you're acting  kevin smith has put you in a few movies yeah yeah very entertaining that was it's fun and kevin's a good  good dude and it's a lot of fun but um it's a waste of time because you sit around all day for  someone else to tell you what to do about something another guy wrote right a different guy wrote it  one guy wrote it one guy directed it and you all you do is you just show up and repeat and i'd rather  be sitting there writing stuff and going out and saying hey listen to this you know what do you hear 
[00:46:00]  this yeah yeah you don't seem like the kind of guy that wants to just sit around and i started  at 19 and then we had real tough good acting coaches in new york good teachers good course  you know i really learned technique and all that acting would have been a great life  but that didn't happen and you can't just say oh i'll do that too in my case you can't yeah  some guys do it some guys pull it off very well george carlin's show lasted i think one season  was that was that i'm sure it had some was the writing difficult because of what they were telling  you above was it hard to go where you i knew it probably wouldn't have much of a chance but i was i 
[00:46:30]  think i was 55 then and i said to myself you know i've had a lot of offers from different  directions about sitcoms over the years and uh maybe i ought to at least give this one shot  so i don't say someday gee i should have tried that i mean i hadn't really turned into as good  a writer as that was 15 years ago and i'm a better um i didn't know i was a good writer then i mean i've  had three books since that thing failed i'm so glad that show went away when that guy called me from fox 
[00:47:00]  i said thank you thank you so much for doing this because i was afraid this would drag on for another  year and then come to an end you know um we i had a i had a showrunner creative partner sam simon  who was a brilliant uh brilliant brilliant comic talent but famously disliked by his colleagues in  the business and he admits that and he was very difficult for me and i don't i think the cards  was stacked against me i wasn't part of the club you got to be part of that club that's a hollywood 
[00:47:30]  club and you have to work your way into it in certain ways and coming in from the outside like  that uh uh it didn't work and and they didn't back my show fox didn't really back it so so that's fine  but um i wanted to give it a shot i want i didn't want to walk away saying i'd never tried that yeah  well that music means that we are ending this side of the show slightly damn it um we're definitely  plug uh joey we're so happy you came in man by the way for the trick-or-treaters we're we're

[00:51:00]  let me get this straight  you're a married guy  you're kind of  you're not getting along with the wife  they haven't been getting along for a long time  now it's all coming out  she hasn't spoken to the guy  in years  is what they're saying  yeah  and the idea of the two of them  mating it all  just gives you  makes the hair  on the back of your neck stand up  you just  you're thankful  that their children are old enough  so that you can say  it happened a while ago  yeah  you know  happened a long time ago  i don't want to think of him doing anything now  and from what we hear  he's not doing much of anything 
[00:51:30]  justice  take away our td bars  take away uh  the strip clubs  take away your boner  see  no sex in a year  it's karma  see and one of the few times  it actually has had  had any effect  where you could actually see it happen  yeah  because most of the time  good people die  and schmucks live on  right  live on  this was a  this is a great moment in time  but i mean this guy  decency  it's like  i didn't move here  for decency  if i wanted decency  i go to omaha  yeah exactly  when you moved here 
[00:52:00]  this was  you knew what you were getting  a despicable city  disgusting  if you wanted to go to the bathroom  you could go to the bathroom  anywhere  nobody bothered you  it wasn't like  oh god  oh look  there's uh  there's an origins  i can't hear  too much light  yeah you didn't  you didn't  that's not what we bought into  no  in new york  on 42nd street  was when i moved in  42nd street  it was nice  now you hear the tourists  go oh  42nd street  you're like  what  you could get  and a burger 
[00:52:30]  right  what more could you ask  what a  what a good afternoon  that is  right  and now we miss that  oh man  but it's just incredible  and the other thing  that whole thing  about the catholic church  look  you know  he like  he's the defender  of the catholic church  i  catholics  knocked the catholic church  it's the church  it's there to be knocked  right  okay  because why  because they got a big guy  you know the pope  and he wears a dress  you call him the big guy  i think he's the big guy  i like him  i get a big  i love catholics 
[00:53:00]  because basically  the jews created guilt  and the catholics codified it  and then the  then the protestants  transformed it into tension  so  you've got this guy  i mean  are you screaming  oh boy you can't yell  about the church  that's why  you don't yell  about another catholic  that's what you don't do  yeah  but the church  hoo ha  and he said well  if somebody yelled about jews  but you're yelling about jews  we don't have some sort of  a monolithic structure  that's unbelievable  you got  i mean  it's called the banking system  how can you not  how can you not 
[00:53:30]  yell about it  it's fabulous  louis what  why did you kill our god though  oh  why  because he said  we're gonna leave now  and we went  no  hello  we want to stay  in the playground  that's why  he said come on  follow me  we're getting out of here  uh-uh  nope  really was the wrong time  we just started organizing  as a as a being  on the planet  and what  now you're putting down  rules and regulations  we just got out  of the goddamn caves  yeah really  i mean wait  wait a sec  they wrote this book  the old testaments  and you're actually saying  we have to live like that 
[00:54:00]  i don't think so  give us time to sin  a little bit  a couple of thousand years  of fun  then come back  a little wrath  and we're fine  well come back now  you know  now would be a great time  but anyone that comes back  and says they're jesus  we gotta put them in belvia  we talked to the son of god  two weeks ago  did you  right here on this show  yeah he called up  it was uh  he said he was jesus  he was in belvia  yeah  he called from belvia  and then you think  oh my god  well it would be tough  for him to find tv time  that would be the thing  well he enjoys the show  they wouldn't even give him 
[00:54:30]  a cable channel  he enjoys the show  i think i think  uh it was better  in the old days  when if you knocked  the catholic church  they put you on a rack  and disemboweled you  yeah  now you know  you just get  julianney kind of  yelling at you  i mean the biggest shock  about that uh  that uh  that painting in brooklyn  was is that  who knew there was a museum  there  yeah  see i think it was  a plug for the museum  you too  a museum in brooklyn  yeah really  i lived there  i didn't know  there were no signs  there's no signs  i didn't even know  where it is  it's out there 
[00:55:00]  somewhere  the brooklyn museum  so he's all up in arms  about that  but then meanwhile  now he's got his chick  who has now been  kicked out of the mansion  yeah  he can't bring her in  so now you hear  what the latest is  julianney now trying  to have donahann over  removed as the official  hostess at gracie mansion  man  so he  i missed that one today  yeah it's just getting  so ugly  and i i love  looking in on it  well nothing  nothing after spending  time in the big house  for that  for that pig's 
[00:55:30]  concept  of morality  makes me happier  than watching him  torture  it is a lot of fun  what does lewis mean  by that  you know  the old  the old voyeurbus.com  there's naked women  on a bus  driving  through a town  in my city  so let's go  let's go and stop them  and there's a jew  on the bus  let's torture him  yes sir  because i heard him  say some bad things  about our lord  let's get him  seems like you're still  holding a grudge  lewis  i will hold a grudge  he cost me money 
[00:56:00]  he cost me time  i had to listen  to norton weep  it was only six months ago  it was only six months  and he'll never pass  he will never pass  he will always pay for that  he doesn't  we can't even file suit  against him  you know  yeah we almost got tb  tb  i think i may have tb  isn't that from  anal intercourse  no no no  oh i'm sorry  i thought it was vd  no no no  vd  they said watch out  for tb  and uh hepatitis  ah  you know 
[00:56:30]  what do you think  of the timothy mcveigh man  well you know  you got a guy  who uh wants to die  and we're not gonna kill him  that's the kind of country  i love to live in  yeah  you know the guy  it's the first time  we got somebody  and it's the first time  everybody i think agrees  except for about six people  that this is called  out of control  okay  we can discuss  all sorts of things  about the death penalty  but anyone  you know  with any kind of  lick of common sense  basically he's like  no he wants to die  he did this  we're not gonna talk about it  but then how does the fbi  misplace 
[00:57:00]  three thousand  and that's now  it's supposed to be  more pages  i mean just give it  just give it to them  you know why  he fessed up to it  it's not like you're  holding  uh oh  look at this  it's uh  an fbi file  on the tires  he had on the car  we busted him in  this might set him free  yeah  this might turn over  his confession  and the evidence  and the fact that  he uh  he said he did it  and did it  yeah  but for some reason  they held it back  and now it's screwed  the whole thing up  it's completely screwed  it up  and it's basically  you know  it's really  you know  i mean 
[00:57:30]  we have very little  stake in it  other than  you know  we kind of  look at it  okay  but those  those poor  bastards  who were  who were involved  whose families  were involved  it's like  talking about  torment  i mean  it's like  you know  poking them  with a stick  in the eye  every day  i like the um  the iranian way  they take care  of their criminals  i got it  well they're a fun  group  a little  i heard  this story  was in the paper  the other day  there was a  a woman  accused  of um  being in porno  sentenced to death  guess how they 
[00:58:00]  found this chick  i never knew  the law enforcement  was so good  over there  in iran  they watched  the movie  her electric  meter was in  the background  they zoomed  in on it  got the number  off the meter  and busted her  no  and and went  into her house  she was uh  convicted of some  wacky crimes  against god  kind of thing  uh  and they stoned  her to death  and get this  how they stone  you to death  over there  they bury you  up to your head  if you're a man  up to your armpits  if you're a woman  and then proceed  to throw huge rocks  at your head  and if you can 
[00:58:30]  crawl out  of your your hole  that you're buried  in and probably  tamped down  uh  then you're free  because it was  god's will  to let you in  as you're getting  boulders thrown  at your head  but i kind of like  that concept  louis you like that  right  well it's an  interesting guy  except your show  would be off the air  yeah  you would have  uh  basically there'd be  no women coming out  well i don't like  the laws  i just like the way  they deal with it  like if you blow up  a federal building  buried up to the neck  because i doubt  i would ever be  buried up to my neck  with rocks hurling  towards me going  how did this happen 
[00:59:00]  well yeah  you know  yeah but you know what  that's all right  the problem here  then is  since we're a  democracy  then we'd have  to discuss  it would be  a 72 year  discussion  of the size  of the rock  the democrats  think that the  rocks should be  6.6 inches  republicans  i don't like  the idea  of rocks  of this size  where's my  shivis  jason what's  going on  dude i totally  agree with ruse black  and i totally  believe in like  the u.s  the united states 
[00:59:30]  it's becoming  feminine  we're turning  into a pussy  no one stands  up for anything  anymore  we take it in the  ass every day  by every freaking  country we don't  do anything anymore  dude a dude  wants to die  fry him  get rid of him  yeah we try  harder to keep  them from dying  even when they  want to  right  he wants to  die and it's  not like a lot  of people that are  against the death  penalty they bring  up things like  maybe it's not him  maybe if there's  evidence maybe  this but no  it's him but  this is who is  responsible  but the most  ironic thing is 
[01:00:00]  it's not a group  of guys it's not  a group of like  20 years ago even  you'd have a group  of people out you  know the aclu  or whatever they  would be out in  front you're trying  to stop this is  kind of barbaric  and now it's the  fbi it's the  people who want  him smoke  right you know i  mean what are they  thinking and why  and there's like  it should be just  sort of a giant  investigation that  goes on because  those guys  or maybe they  should be wearing  dresses like jay  edgar hoover  that's my solution  go home at night  put on a dress  i just think there's 
[01:00:30]  scandal in everything  now because people  i think there always  was i think people  look really deep  into things now  when they make the  news and you find  the scandal that  happens but everything  is a scandal now  yeah everything is  scandalous yeah  what and what about  this guy this uh  senator from um  oh the turncoat  the turncoat  this is unbelievable  that's the best  this guy  how do you change  your party  in midstream  totally smacking  your constituency  in the face 
[01:01:00]  society just doesn't  want to be a  republican anymore  it's not the  constituency  because the  constituency of  vermont pretty  much will drift  wherever they're  going you know  we're not talking  if you sat there  and voted republican  right and then all  of a sudden they  have the majority  but they're you  know they're a  state that basically  is a heavy  environmental state  and you got this  idiot comes into  office and god  love him because  for me he wins  he i've never seen  anything like him  here we go  he is one of the  most it's unbelievable  i watched his  press conference it 
[01:01:30]  was clinically i  can't watch it i  literally have to  start hurting myself  i'm getting into  cutting while he's  on  you know i just  take a chunk out  just to stop myself  from the pain he's  giving me  it's unbelievable  that's what caused  jeffards to leave  i mean it's like  he's going well  what are we going  to do about the  oil what are we  going to do about  energy oh we're  going to we're  going to dig for  more oil you know  we're going to  come into your  home and you know  and put a little  something up your  keister and look  there if we can  he'd pump it out  of human beings  if he could 
[01:02:00]  that idiot  he's star craving  man like it's a  really great energy  proposal if it was  1958 if there was  black and white tv  and we didn't know  squat you don't like  the energy proposal  it's psychotic  what's the matter  with it what's the  matter with it it's  got nothing to do  we're in the 21st  century i got a phone  that's like three  inches big this jackass  is going to tell me  you can't there's no  alternatives to energy  are you nuts how do  people listen to him  we're just going to do  a little drilling in  alaska no big deal  great nine months of oil 
[01:02:30]  that's all it's going to  get nine months  that's going to help  have you ever been to  alaska yeah  it doesn't affect us  i haven't even seen it  we're not going to go  there i've been there  you don't want to rile  those people they'll  come in those are the  people who will come in  and do damage to us  they don't care they're  liquored up the entire  year them and the  animals leave them  alone it's nine months  of oil okay it's not  worth anything nine  months is not worth  anything tell me you've  gone up there and you're  gonna get 50 years of oil  it's gotta be more than  nine months nine months 
[01:03:00]  that's the deal  what two dinosaurs died  and got buried years ago  i sit and read this  crap every day do you  think i get upset for  no reason at all so the  proposal the energy  proposal is too hard on  the environment is what  you're saying no that's  got nothing to do i don't  care about the environment  not a tree hug i live  i'm looking where i live  if i like trees i like  buildings i like  buildings and people  right animals and trees  i look at them for a  second ago they give me  a rash you know so 
[01:03:30]  what's your problem with  the proposal that was  stark raving mad you  think so well look  first off they have to  live to another energy  crisis we had an energy  crisis didn't we and  what was the idea well  let's conserve let's do  this let's do that why  don't we do something to  find out about solar  energy why don't we find  out about things why  don't we use that 30  year period to actually  make coal something that  can be used coal is  still according to  everything i've read to  say that there's a safe  coal thing is like saying  there's a safe cigarette  right madness and then i  got cheney and if it was 
[01:04:00]  somebody else i got oil  boy one and oil boy two  i got the heat cheney's  over there he's getting  hummers in his uh in his  little pad from people  who gave him 250 000 bucks  most of them a ton of them  are oil guys and they're  saying that's nothing that  bill clinton didn't do  oh no no i look let's not  even go back i don't even  want to talk about him i  spent eight years bashing  that pig now i got a new  pig let's get off that  pig we got a new pig to  bash  dick cheney was having a  little party  fun outside he put up a 
[01:04:30]  little tent he had people  come in that um supported  uh the campaign right and  it's not like come in here  and then kick the money in  they kick the money in first  so it's not it's even better  than what clinton was doing  no it is better it's a really  good thing it's a really  clean way to want a  government and let's let's  let's just keep doing it  let's put everybody in a  toga too while we're at it  and have big parties and  drink till we vomit  carl says carl says you're  wrong lois carl  carl  hey guys what's going on 
[01:05:00]  hey what's up carl  lois is totally wrong  no i'm not i mean i don't  know what he's reading but  nine months of oil  nine months of oil  fact nine months of oil  it's a fact  no way it's at least 30  years at least 30  no it's not it's nine  months of oil  the jews can make it last  for 30 years  nine months of oil  look at what they did in  Hanukkah  that's what that's what i  got over at the daily when  they did their research it's  nine months of oil and i'm  going to stick with the  daily show  daily show research  that's what we do we got  to  you're insane  we got it because 
[01:05:30]  you lose your credibility  i sat there i said it  can't be nine months of  oil and they said it was  nine months of oil  so getting back to the  senator what does the  energy thing have to do  with this  now you don't you don't  like uh bill clinton  bill clinton's you don't  like uh uh bush's uh  energy proposal and i can't  see what you can't see  what i can't see i think  it's a viable plan you  know what i think too  while we're at it let's  sell more suvs and you  know what you know say  you know what screw the  suvs let's get monster 
[01:06:00]  trucks  you know because as long  as we're going to do this  let's make it impossible to  move on the streets let's  not worry about  i think we should i was  walking over here trying to  get a bus to come up the  street and i'm sitting  there going this is  psychotic it is reached  epic in this city you  can't even get around so  should we be like ed  bagley jr and ride around  on scooters no that's not  the alternative it's not  ed bagley jr where do you  come up with this i see  ed bagley jr with his 
[01:06:30]  electric car that oh yeah  that technology is great i  just passed 30 electric gas  stations on my way in all  right no so so that isn't  even a concept i and and  believe me you want to go  back to the day of the  pinto and the yugo and  the other o's that suck  this car i like my suv i'm  glad it sucks down the gas  a little bit and you  can't but then and it's  smaller than a monster truck  it is smaller than a monster  truck but those are coming  next possibly more derricks  there's plenty of oil down  there is not plenty of  oil and it's not a question 
[01:07:00]  i should keep pumping the  oil that's fine by me but  you know why when 30 you  know it's basically both  sides and we can't even  begin to discuss that it's  not both sides that are  involved in this this huge  problem we tried nuclear  look what happens there one  pops up and the whole  population goes crazy you  think you're going to be  able to put a whole  battery a solar panel  somewhere without people  going it's too close to the  schools it causes brain  tumors of course yeah i mean  whatever we do is going to  be wrong right but that's  the wrong right let me say 
[01:07:30]  that  no you've got it you've got  to uh you've got to look it's  just the fact that this is we've  done we did this 30 years  ago yeah and that nothing  you remember the gas lines  right yeah and nothing  changed they did nothing  they sat on their asses they  didn't they come up with a  come up with a department of  energy that actually that  really does anything about  this no meanwhile we got  cell phones meanwhile you  know you got uh you got like  they can come up with this  uh technology to like shoot  like uh missiles non-existent 
[01:08:00]  missiles out of the air oh we're  going to do it we're going to  send things up in space we're  going to have lasers the star  wars that was introduced by one  of the greatest presidents of  all time ronald rade  he was a genius by the way  thank you lewis i'm glad i'm  i'm glad you agree oh yeah  there's a man who hated my  my motherland russia okay and  right and talk about stupid  oh the russians are going to  get us my family came from  russia okay they arrived here in  1906 these idiots didn't know  they were here until 1964 we're 
[01:08:30]  not talking about a country filled  with geniuses oh boy they're  going to come get us they're  diabolical god they didn't do  they barely had plumbing i don't  even have shoes that's because  they spent a lot of money on  bombs and missiles that uh could  have done a grave damage to this  country if not for the likes of  ronald reagan who outbid them in  the cold war made them fold their  hand the cowboy president he  certainly was revered yes we got  to let lewis towel off i need a 
[01:09:00]  bath you need some espresso mr  gorbachev tear down your  underwear i remember that what's  that goddamn stain on your head  it's shaped like bonzo hello  nancy yes uh lois well here's the  thing yes here's the here's my  problem you got richard cheney was  given a 20 million dollars we call  him dick here well and there's a  reason there's a reason you call him  yeah now dick richard dick cheney was 
[01:09:30]  given 20 million dollars when he quit  working for big oil that was his last  job big oil oil that's so big it has no  name it has no name we don't even know  what they do we don't even know where  they get their oil from and they gave  him when he went to run for vice  president they gave him 20 million bucks  in the and he's and he kept it okay and  he said he'd have no trouble being  objective about oil companies well you  know what liar liar pants on fire oh my  god he pulled out the liar liar pants on  fire you get 20 debates over and the 
[01:10:00]  argument you get 20 million bucks okay  from an oil company i'll tell you this  and i think most people would agree  you have there's no objectivity less  you are in love with oil companies right  as a matter of fact if somebody pumped  your gas you probably okay and give  them a 20 and say hey partner thanks  keep the chain well you know something  uh meet the new boss same as the old  boss bill clinton i'll bring him up  again he got so much money from the  goddamn chinese and in return uh people 
[01:10:30]  were saying that uh the chinese weren't  taking our military secrets and that he  wasn't selling it and companies didn't  have free reign to give china our uh  missile technology no but the food  which i think is a lot more dangerous  than a little oil deal going back and  forth the food in the restaurants was  better that's true i'll agree with you  that it's the same thing nothing  changes no i know nothing changes but  you have to still scream about the  fact that it's not changing is  completely idiotic and at some point  you gotta you gotta go hey the emperor  has no clothes enough is enough you you

[01:34:30]  deals where it was  like a restaurant  and there was a  function room  to the right  it was like  some sort of  bachelor party  was going on  and I'm standing  there in front of  like eight people  going  what's up  with Dan Quayle  just eating my balls  and all of a sudden  I just look over  and I see  these three  fucking evil  high school  football player  looking guys  just standing there  and I didn't get  what was going on  I'm like  guys  there's plenty of seats  plenty of seats  and I'm just 
[01:35:00]  fucking standing there  and all of a sudden  in the middle  of one of my jokes  this fucking dinner roll  comes in at about  at least  Mach 4  bangs off my forehead  and then  plow  against the back wall  and I'm fucking  dazed  and I turn  all those guys  are gone  just sitting there  I got like a welt  from a dinner roll  it was a fresh one too  that's how fucking  it was the butter side  that hit you too  I remember  it was just this  butter  mouth  side of man  nobody does anything  nobody who's running 
[01:35:30]  the restaurant  does a fucking thing  and I still got like  another ten minutes  sitting there with butter  on the side of my face  and how long  do you think  they sat there  going  dude I'm gonna  throw a fucking  roll at his head  oh at that point  I think everybody  was thinking  of different things  they could throw  for the rest of the show  so I'm on the gig  and it was  and then  Alan the Monkees  me Robert Kelly  and a couple of other guys  were in this comedy group  we had to go up  later that night  and remember  there was a magician  Jeff Apotheca  who did magic  at the time  masters of ceremony  Jeff Apotheca 
[01:36:00]  that was his  outgoing message  calling this guy  for gigs  you have reached  masters of ceremonies  and he's fucking  Lee Massachusetts  like he's fucking  Billy Graham  but he had like  a bedazzled jacket  with like  and so he's got  all his stuff  set up like  previously on stage  like in all these  cards  you know  giant joker card  you remember  Bobby just goes up  on stage  and because Bobby's  set wasn't going great  he just starts  picking up this guy's  acting like  he's pulling the shit out  he's like 
[01:36:30]  oh there's a  there's a fake dove  in here  and this guy's  just standing there  watching Bobby  and he just  this is the exact  quote  you see the color  leave his face  and he goes  my illusions  my illusions  my illusions  that night was  the first  the first three  three and a half  years of our  fucking career  every night  running into him  in one impossible  situation  the fucking  bell rick and  ninety nines  that were standing 
[01:37:00]  up there  they're like  shutting off  the bruins  playoff game  okay you guys  ready for some  coming  put the game on  it was better  when they  would leave a game  on for us  but like  turn the sound  down  so it'd just  be like  you're set  going all  sudden  you hear  come on  come on  me and my  brother used  to do acoustic  gigs  out in  Huntington  and they  would do  that during  the  Islander  games  and they  turn the  sound  down  and you're  playing  and sometimes  it would  coincide  right when  you finish  a song 
[01:37:30]  something would  happen  and you'd  hear  yeah  and you're  thinking  wow  we did  we did  great  and then you  look and  realize it's  just a  fucking  television  and you  stink  and no one  wants you  there  you nailed  it because  I had to  do a gig  Robbie Krieger  was playing  at a stupid  rock club  probably the  same rock  club you  played at  yeah  one of those  tiny tiny  little  yeah  it's Robbie  Krieger  from the  door  it was that  shithole in  Long Beach  I think  I forgot the  name of it  whatever  so I'm  the DJ  I gotta like  do the whole  thing you know  hand out  bumper stickers  and say  hey everybody  Robbie Krieger 
[01:38:00]  and the place  maybe fit  a hundred people  maybe  and they had  an Islander game  on you guys  nailed this  and they wouldn't  turn the sound  down even  for Robbie  Krieger  it's Robbie  fucking Krieger  I mean they  turned it down  but you can still  hear the game  and people are  playing pool  and you know  I'm gonna say  the exact same  thing you did  but yeah  during these  you know  he's just  playing  without Jim  Morrison singing  obviously  just the great  guitar riffs  and people are  screaming you know  for the Islander game  what is going  through his head  at that moment  right  right  I was in the  fucking doors 
[01:38:30]  man  Hollywood Bowl  yeah  fucking rock  that place  now people are  screaming for the  Islanders as he's  playing you know  Spanish Caravan  thinking it's  Stephen Wright  you ever seen a show  at the Bowl  have you seen a show  at the Hollywood Bowl  it's basically like  a great show  until 920  and then there's  like this ordinance  that they have to  turn the fucking  volume down  to like 4  really  so like mid show  Aerosmith  you're like  this is great  and it's just like  goes all the way down  because the neighbors  have this thing  at 920  you can't  they can't  crank the music 
[01:39:00]  anymore  oh that sucks  that's the worst  combo I think  ever  comedy and music  and everybody  always tries to  get those shows  together  where it's like  yeah it's gonna be  back in the day  yeah you're gonna  open and you know  you know  Juice Newton's  gonna come out  and do 22 minutes  that'll be great  nobody's there to see me  they're here for Juice  oh yeah  speaking of  that's a tough gig  opening for a rock band  I was gonna say  speaking of music  and comedy  the VMAs  yeah  we gotta get  into that a little bit  Dane Cook  they gave you what 
[01:39:30]  3 or 4 minutes  yeah it was like  2 minutes  2 minutes  and it was  2 and a half hours  into  I mean that was like  that was like a blitz  man coming at you  that was just  I was backstage  they had me back  with Snoop  waiting to go out  and they were like  the guy's pushing me  one of the guys  you guys are like  you gotta stand right here  stand right here  and I'm literally  up against electricity  everything is just like  wires and all the  backs of the stage  and then I hear  hit the water  because that was the theme  electricity and water 
[01:40:00]  and there's water  dripping on me  before my set  I'm like I'm getting  I'm getting rained on  as I'm leaning on  all the wires  that are like  right around my head  what are you thinking  are you thinking  like this is  I'm gonna kill  or are you like  this is just  fucking horrendous  okay so first of all  there's  there's fireballs  going off  during everybody's  performance  you've got rappers  that are threatening  each other  and Suge  Suge had been shot  the night before  a guy with a hooded  sweatshirt shot  Suge Knight  and so all this  stuff's happening  and they got monsoons  and I'm standing there  like I've got two jokes 
[01:40:30]  and that's about it  I'm like can I have a  sparkler  I'll stick it in my ass  I don't care  just give me something  you know body paint  so it really was  one of those things  where I was like  either just go out there  and just you know  talk about the show  I really kind of wish  I'd go on my first instinct  because I went out there  and just ended up  playing for the camera  but I wanted to go out  there and say  you know what  fuck you 50 cent  fuck you Fat Joe  I'm in this thing now  and just like try to get  involved in their beef  but it was just like  go out do it  and get the hell out of there 
[01:41:00]  man that was wild  and Bill you were saying  what Kelly Clarkson  was right before him  oh yeah  oh yeah  screeching in that shower  that's what I was  because I knew  he was going to be on  I started out  I want to see Dane  on this thing  it's going to be  fucking great  and like  two minutes into the show  I'm like  oh this is going to be  this is horrifying  it was just like  everybody  half the fucking girls  that can't even sing  so they have to  add all this extra  they like lower them  from ceilings  they're coming out  with animals and shit  they think if you  excite their visual sense  that your audio sense 
[01:41:30]  won't pick up  on the fact that they stink  Mariah Carey  who can sing  is standing there  in this pool  and she's got  backup dancers  who did a back flip  into a pool  and started dancing  underwater  with this underwater camera  and then like  we got comedian  Dane Cook  and I'm like  oh dude  this is going to be  fucking horrific  and everybody  right around the front  like all these kids  they were flipping out  and I just remember  at one point  sometimes you just see  random stuff  during your set  where you're like  you're trying to  you're in your head 
[01:42:00]  you're trying to figure out  and I looked down  and there was a kid  just smacking his own face  I'm like  I don't know  he's on E  or this is just like  the new way to clap  but he's like  he's just staring  and he's like  yeah  and he's smacking himself  over and over  he's like  in the face  hit me in the face  isn't that great  when you don't  you're not looking at  because everyone assumes  you're looking at  the big picture  and a lot of people say  oh the lights are in their eyes  so you really don't see  the crowd  there are sometimes  you do just pick out  one person  or one event  that's going on  a fight  a conversation 
[01:42:30]  and even though  you're going through  the motions  and you're saying  or you're singing  or you're doing  whatever you do up there  you're thinking  what the fuck  is going on  out there  and it never comes  across on stage  because you're a professional  you're doing what you do  but you're looking  and going  that is the most  fucked up thing  I've ever seen  this should really  distract me  I did a college gig  a couple months ago  and there was a girl  in the front row  I swear to god  this girl looked 14  but she's showing her titties  during the show  and it was like  it was great  because it was titties  but I'm like  this girl's like  literally 14 years old 
[01:43:00]  she's like the  Doogie Howser  of this college  she was just like  she was advanced  from 8th grade  to like  cake parties  in every way  apparently  yes  wow that's funny  you guys all  have nightmare stories  though  I haven't seen  one comic that went  every gig's been gold  since I started  there's always  a fucking nightmare  or 8th  and it never ends  either  no huh  even if you keep  doing college gigs  it never ends  it never ends  did Bobby ever tell you  the Boston Garden gig 
[01:43:30]  when we played  we did the  Rock of Boston show  back when they were  doing that every year  it was the biggest  bomb gig  we'd ever done  and Bobby was  probably so psyched  oh Bobby was  I mean he was  it was the group  again we were  doing this  you know  every year  they did  the Rock of Boston  and they're like  we're gonna put you  on again  music and comedy  you're gonna be on  right before Fish  it's two hours  into the show  it was like  Extreme's gonna go on  and you  I was actually  in the crowd  for that  I don't even know why  you're always at 
[01:44:00]  the worst possible  situation  I swear to God  he's like  I'm gonna tune in  I'm like  don't fucking tune in  Burr  when Billy says  I'm gonna be at the gig  or tune in  I know I'm in trouble  that was early on  he didn't  no I was like  everyone else  I was going there  for the music  like everyone else  I already had  I already had tickets  at least he's being honest  no I didn't know  that they were gonna  be on that  and then all of a sudden  it's just like  yeah dude  we're gonna be doing that  so literally  it was one another thing  two minutes into the show  I'm like  how the fuck  are they gonna do like  there's like  20,000 people there  oh man 
[01:44:30]  like this improv group  they bring us out  okay  and when they first announced  that we were gonna go out  and perform  people didn't know  we were comedy  I think they thought  we were like an acapella group  so at first  everyone's like  we're like  we've arrived man  they really care  so we get out there  we've got these awful  lapel mics on  there's four of us  and I'll never forget  Bobby's up there  and Bobby goes up to the mic  and he's like  yeah we're gonna do some improv  we're gonna blah blah blah  and it's just  it's the garden  so the sound is awful  it's just echoing  you can't hear anything  anyone's saying 
[01:45:00]  nothing  nothing  and about a minute in  you feel the entire  like you feel people  oh no  looking at each other  going  they're not gonna sing  they're like  trying to do comedy  and I'm telling you  it was like  three, two, one  and all of a sudden  lighters  a million lighters  just came like  whipping  lighters in shoes  people sacrificing  their shoes  that's what I'm thinking  I'm like  I'm getting pelted  with lighters  but I'm like  did they bring 
[01:45:30]  extra shoes to throw  or are they so angry  that they're taking  off their shoes  that they don't even care  they're gonna be  walking home without shoes  I mean upper deck  shit littering  wow  you guys were in  that kung fu bit  and Al would stand  off stage  he remembers  doing the voices  and they were like  I will kill you now  and you know  we're acting out  and they acted out  with somebody else  doing the sound  oh no  and so we're getting  hit and all this stuff  and then finally  you know  we're hitting  sha-na-na-na  right at that point  right  it's you know  hey hey hey 
[01:46:00]  goodbye  hey hey goodbye  yep  Bobby goes up to the mic  and he's like  I want to say something  something something  oh no  and they actually shut up  the whole crowd  like stops  and I'm like  Bobby's my hero  at this point  right  I'm staring at this kid  he's got his long  Rico Suave hair  down to his fucking asshole  right  he's looking like  Crystal Gale  and he's like  I want to say something  right now  and then everyone  shouts up  and he goes  we didn't come here  to ruin your night  oh no  he starts getting  like defensive  yeah  and then he goes  like this  he goes  and we're gonna leave 
[01:46:30]  and of course  they're like  yeah  after the next two skits  that we're here to do  and it was like  more lighters and shoes  holy shit  what a nightmare  wow  a set of balls  walking up to the mic  like that  oh no  that is really funny  oh and it's like  home turf for him  no more music  and comedy please  no especially  like a fish show  just laid back  and comedy  and especially  improv comedy  you need the crowd  to be focused on you  yeah you don't want  to do it in front  of a bunch of potheads  like you can't get 
[01:47:00]  a concert crowd  to pay attention  all at once  to the band  that they were there  they're talking  they're smoking  they're doing  whatever the fuck  they do  for comedy  it's like  unless you have  a huge portion  of that audience  focused on you  you're done  no we're asking  we're like  we need an appliance  and like millions  of people are like  Justin  I think I heard  I think I heard  a microwave  I think I heard  it's like  I think I heard  a thousand people  yelling shit at us  right now  clusterfuck  yeah  but these are the gigs 
[01:47:30]  gentlemen  that build your character  now you're playing  the garden there  Dane Cook  last night  show number one  how was it  it was amazing  I think that tonight  we get two tonight  was that the biggest show  of your life you think  no it was  we did the tourgasm tour  and we did some  pretty big venues there  and I did that  Gator Graw last year  which was 50,000  I don't know if you've  done that  that's pretty cool  what's your audience  made up of a lot  yeah it's pretty mixed up  I mean it's definitely  that college core  but no I look out 
[01:48:00]  and it seems to be  all over the board  yeah you got a lot of  chicks though  that like  want to fuck you  and things like that  a lot of girls  yeah they wear t-shirts  with my joke  which is really great  because like  half the time  I'm just kind of  going off the cuff  anyway so I'll look down  I'll see titties  with like  fuck bees on it  and I'm like  I'll do that next  some 14 year old girl  hasn't lifted it up yet  hey let's say hi  to Ryan in New Jersey  saw Dane Cook last night  Ryan what's up  what's up dude  Dane man  you fucking ruled last night  hey thanks a lot man 
[01:48:30]  thanks for coming out dude  yeah dude  Bob Kelly ruled too  my girlfriend doesn't  even like 0 and 8  and none of that shit  but last night man  she fucking loved Kelly  loved you  and now I think  she's an 0 and 8 fan  oh that's cool  oh that's good  good deal man  it's hard to get  the girls on  but see  you got it knocked  you know  the girls are there  with you  you got a very  diverse crowd  us  it's a cock fest  it's just like  yeah fucking A guys  and the girls  they hate it  and I don't know  what we're doing  we're trying to soften  our delivery a little bit  so we can have more  women out there 
[01:49:00]  yeah  it's not working at all  let's bring some girls  down to the studio  we're gonna do hugs  we're gonna do free hugs  every hour  come on down  well we noticed  since Jimmy's been gone  the past couple days  girls have warmed up  to us a little bit  that's right  we had girls in the studio  that were willing to  take all their clothes off  which is always a good thing  a girl called up to play  guess what's in my pants  Jimmy  we had a strap on show  the other day  Jimmy scares girls away  they walk in  and he looks like  he's gonna be a problem  he looks like  he looks like  no matter what they do 
[01:49:30]  he's gonna want to go  one step more  than they're willing to go  like they could want to  take that  like the girls the other day  they came in  completely naked  took that wiffle ball bat  right up there  lubed it up  and stuck it right inside them  and we measured  how deep it went  everything fine  with Jimmy  they're probably thinking  he's gonna want to  stick it up my ass  like just that  one step  where it's probably  gonna be a problem  so they don't even  want to get started  when you think about  what Jimmy talks about  and then you wonder 
[01:50:00]  what the skeletons are  in his closet  yeah what could there  possibly be in there  he's gotta be  holding something back  it has to involve  murdered children  it's all I can imagine  it's gotta be  kids  death  rape  he's just gonna have  like another room  that he's dug out  in his basement  or something like that  but he's just got him  down there bound  and gagged  and tries out  his new bits on him  what a little creep  by the way  speaking of Bob Kelly  he gave us the  famous cast  alright  oh yeah  how's that going  on the auction  uh yeah  on our O&A auction 
[01:50:30]  it's up to  thirteen  thirteen hundred dollars  nice  for I broke  my knee man  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee man  hold my hand man  Dane Cook obviously  was there when that happened  filming the tourgasm thing  I've never heard any  horrific sound  like that in my life  that was just  that pop  and then  and when you see  the video that goes  with it  it's just  it's crazy  he had no business  no business  playing football  we did  none of us did  here's what was stupid  you could 
[01:51:00]  I'm telling you  we were playing  on uneven terrain  in like a gravel pit  you know  we were just like  oh we'll throw a ball around  and then we got competitive  it was not flat  like a field  it was really like hilly  and it was just  we were dumb  we were dumb  but Bobby tried to  you know  go up and do some kind of  like a Heisman fucking catch  no Bobby gets crazy  when he plays sports  I remember one time  I was playing against him  and he wasn't having  a good day or something  I had a couple of catches  and he just  he's hilarious  he's just competitive  so he got mad at me  so I just see the look  on his face  that he wants to take me 
[01:51:30]  out on this play  so he came at me  and somehow I was able  to push him down  to the ground  he landed on the ground  he got  he was so mad  that he grabbed  two handfuls of grass  ripped them out of the ground  and he got up  and he just threw them at me  and they went about  90 miles an hour  for two inches  and then they went  right in front of me  I just remember this  this black kid  who was on my team  goes  yo he bugged him  he had to go back  to the huddle  he's trying to hit you 
[01:52:00]  with like confetti  oh yeah  he was unbelievable  what is that gonna do  the rage  angry little guy  he's the most competitive  guy I know  and I admit  I'm pretty competitive  but we had a  when we used to have  a game back in 93  I don't know if Bill  you were part of this  awful horrible thing  it was called  punch each other  in the asshole  no I would have  remembered that  that's something  you don't forget  okay so we started  this thing where  we would just start  randomly if you know  the other one was  walking in front of you  up the stairs  we would not just punch  we would uppercut 
[01:52:30]  and try to hit taint  try to hit anything  we could  full tilt boogie  punch into your asshole  and it became like  Bobby and I being  so competitive about it  that we actually  had to sit down  I'll never forget  sit down and have  a very serious  conversation about it  where it involved us  looking at each other  going we gotta stop  punching each other  in the asshole  this is really  like can we just  can we call it even  are we  you know  we have to stop  doing this  and we couldn't  I mean for the  longest time  we just still had  to like  and we wanted  to make each other  like shit our pants 
[01:53:00]  it was like a full  like a real  like the hardest hit  you could imagine  I wanna know  how that starts  one of you  had to come up with it  you didn't both  come up with the idea  at the same exact time  who punched  whose ass  and it's pretty brave  to be the person  I was gonna say  it's pretty brave  for the person  to introduce that  to other guys  hey guys  I got a great new idea  for us to pass the time  I would think  to do the classic  leg sweep  if someone was in front of me  I would never think  we used to do  blindside tackle  you know  one guy would like  you know  be on all fours  behind someone  and then you knock 
[01:53:30]  him over the guy  oh yeah  when he was  the bottom of the shoe  kick  when you're behind  somebody and they're  walking  they step  and you kick  the bottom of their shoe  and they  they do like  a Nazi goose step  with one foot  goes flying  or the flat tire  where you just step  on the back  of their shoe  and take off  their Achilles tendon  the cross check  into the locker  you could be looking  down for his notebook  those unforgiving  metal lockers  I like the coin slap  anytime somebody's  counting their change  you're like  what do you think  I can't  and you just  hit it underneath  it's just like  this rainbow 
[01:54:00]  of currency  you had your guys  doing a lot of  activities on tour  there  I saw the  yeah  saw the scooter  we would have slept  all day  I mean that was  the thing  it was like  these guys hated me  because I'm going  every day  we're going to get up  just for the sake  of filming  during the day  because we'd sleep  until the crack  they had some mean  things to say  about you though  there Dane  you were working  hard in between shows  horseback riding  what else did you guys do  oh we trashed Bob  for that shit  I was like  I hope for Charlie Murphy 
[01:54:30]  but no point  did he make me  do activities  my day was mine  he didn't call me up  yo we're playing  checkers this morning  get your ass down here  bitch  it looks like  it's going to be  a great video  when it finally comes out  I was watching  the video portion  of your package  the Dane Cook  CD  DVD thing  on the way to LA  with the shorties  and the preview  for tourgasm  it looks like  it's going to be  a good thing  when it finally comes out  everyone's been saying  that  you got a clip  of Bobby  laying on the ground 
[01:55:00]  something about  Bobby with his knees  yeah just screaming  and stuff  we filmed that  the scooter race  though  who took a dive  on that  was that you  yeah that was  really nasty  that was day one  and we had  these little  electronic scooters  and it was just  oh it's going to be  great we're going to  be racing again  me and Bobby  let's eat  and Bobby  very competitive  again  sticks his fucking  foot right back  into my tire  he says he didn't  do it on purpose  but if you look  you kind of see him  kind of look back  and I think he aimed  it so he could  jam my tire 
[01:55:30]  and I of course  went over and cracked  electric scooters  and Bobby's acting  like it's the road warrior  Bobby is a winner  he will figure out  how to come out  on top  yeah  he hates to lose  yeah  go for him  very competitive  yeah we did  we did activities  I saw that clip on Kimmel  that's alright  I saw it on Kimmel  yeah  is that where that was at  yeah just face first  through the asphalt  and Dink  you were in Rolling Stone  recently  the CDs like  selling like crazy  what is it up to now  because we've all been  paying attention  going holy shit  the first week  it was like what 
[01:56:00]  close to a quarter million  copies sold  or something like that  I like the  yeah we went gold  we went gold  I like the  I don't know  when they know  the exact number  Barry Katz knows  exactly how many units  of course he does  he knows exactly  but the CD  gold really  the CD's gotten gold  yeah we went gold  you can't really call it a CD  because you have the DVD  in there and all sorts of stuff  but  what is that  half a million  it's gold or a million  with a double album  we've shipped  almost 500,000 
[01:56:30]  so once you hit 250  that's gold on a double  and then platinum  is probably a few weeks away  yeah  that's amazing  I know man  I sold three of my CDs  off my website  and I bought two of them  I'm pretty proud of them  you want them back  it's just amazing  because people aren't  people are just not  I'm going to autograph them to you  people are just not  buying CDs obviously  like they used to  so a comedy CD  to sell that much  that's just phenomenal  yeah somehow the CD  I've noticed  like I said  in like the last few months  all of a sudden  you go to a college  and it's like you're holding up 
[01:57:00]  like a fucking 8 track  oh you were saying that  the other day  yeah yesterday  it's just  oh now they all want  like a DVD  because they can get  this shit for free  somehow you know  yeah somehow  just ask Steve  he knows  let's say hi to  burn anything for us  yeah Mike on Long Island  Mike what's up  hey boys how you doing  alright  what's up  good  Dan I was at a show last night  wonderful job  thank you dude  how do you feel  when people applaud  for bits you're about to do  oh yeah  all you said was 
[01:57:30]  I went to a party  and the place blew up  right  right  I mean you know what  it's flattering  of course when people  you know kind of hear  they're you know  you feel like a little  like Bon Jovi  it's like you guys  know bad medicine  and everybody just starts  but you know  that's why dude  I like to kind of  I always try to improvise  with stuff  and really not really  know exactly  where I'm going with it  because at least  that makes it interesting  if you've heard the bit before  there's something in there  you're like  oh I never heard that part  or it takes on  kind of a new energy  with every crowd 
[01:58:00]  but it's cool man  it's definitely  I did that one bit  last night  where I threw the mic out  and they finished the  I did the set up  and then they finished  the punch  and that was  I've never really  done anything like that  that was kind of wild  yeah  we've talked to Brian Regan  about that  he goes  it's frustrating  when people are yelling  out the punch line  of jokes  saying cup of dirt  do cup of dirt  and Brian's like  well that's the punch line  alright I'll do it  big yellow one's the sun  yeah exactly  yeah it's weird  I mean even like  I know  I was reading all those  things with Chappelle  before he went into hiding 
[01:58:30]  where it was like  people were just coming  and just  I'm Rick James bitch  and it's like  yeah that must have  just been all over the place  it's a blessing  and a curse  because you dream  as a comic  of doing something  that people actually  give a shit  about quoting at all  and so you want that  your whole career  and then when they do it  you realize  oh man  sometimes it can throw off  the flow of the show  but at this point  I'm digging it  well you gotta be  and it's great  to be huge  and on top like that  are you thinking about  something like burnout 
[01:59:00]  or you know  overexposure  shit like that  where you go  uh oh  you know  what do you do about that  I'm just  at this point  it's  I mean really  things are just  starting to roll  so I'm certainly  not thinking  yeah I'm just  you know  whatever  I gotta take it  right to the end  he's going into  movies next  is that it  do some flicks  he offers  he'll be the next  he'll be the next  guy that just  leaves his comedy  behind  never leave comedy  behind  and does the movie  thing  no I definitely  I'm going to start  doing some more  more flicks  but you know 
[01:59:30]  comedy is  how many lame offers  have you had  for like sitcoms  and movies  that are just like  stop it  here's the worst  pitch I ever had  a guy brought me  in a few years ago  and he goes  we're really excited  we want you  to do this  I'll never forget  look at it  I wanted to  fucking kill you  man  I got Barry  next to me  can we get Barry  on the air  Barry we love  when you come  on the air  with us  this is going to  be the best  pitch you've ever  everyone imitates  Barry and when we  do it no one  understands who  we're imitating  but we have him  in studio today  you have to see him  he's the only guy 
[02:00:00]  I know who wipes  his teeth  while he's talking  to you  listen  so the guy  brings us in  and he goes  here's the show  and this was the  actual pitch  he goes  okay you're a  teacher  you're like a  substitute teacher  and so far  I'm like okay  that hasn't been  done you know  a million times  but yeah  and he's like  and the kids  love you  but here's the deal  you're magic  what  and I'm like  okay I do magic  he's no no no  you're magical  you're Mr. Wiz  that was the name  of the show  you're Mr. Wiz  and he had me  driving like 
[02:00:30]  a rainbow  VW bug  and I do my  spells on the  kids  and I mean  it was just  wow  sit there  and hear this  you're like  have you seen  my stand up  first of all  am I doing  anything like  what you're  talking about  Mr. Wiz  I'm Mr. Wiz  every week  I think I was  on notice  for a month  after that  well you should  have been  that is horrible  and what year  was this about  buddy  you're gonna be  a big star  like 98  or 90  I don't know  it was bad  you know 
[02:01:00]  it just would  have been  bad effects  like bad  cheap sitcom  special effects  for your magic  yeah where you  stay still  yeah  and then they  put the other  person who's  supposed to  appear around  you  but you've  moved a little  bit in between  some awful  time slot  you're on  right after  Sabrina  the teenage  witch  you've made  two of  yourselves  and you  have to  talk to  each other  and there's  got to be  a wall  line between  the two  of you  where they  superimpose  you  talking animal  I got like  a llama  he's got 
[02:01:30]  those real  creepy  mannequin eyes  wow that is  a bad pitch  you gotta think  people are  joking  at first  when you sit  there and  they come up  with these  pitches  and you're  like  alright  this is  a joke  they're  doing  some kind  of a  punk  show  or  something  I actually  I had  some guy  pitch something  to me  a few months  ago  again with  these guys  and I thought  they were  fucking with me  I really  really thought  sometimes you get  guys who  pitch and they  have phenomenal  ideas and they've 
[02:02:00]  actually written  and produced  million dollar  things that have  gone on but they  are so nervous  when they pitch  that they look like  they're having a  seizure when they're  pitching  that was the one  you're talking about  the guy was  sweating and  he's just rambling  on and on  there's no rhyme  or reason  but that was a  real idea  it was a real  idea but the guy  literally had to  carry him out of  there  I was on  notice again  yeah  all right  you're hanging  right Dane  we're going to  take a break  what are we 
[02:02:30]  promoting today  Barry  because Dane's  not going to  do it  retaliation  baby  it's  retaliation  it's out  there  and you can  come by the  show  we might release  a few tickets  that people don't  show up for  for guest lists  and things like  that like if  your people don't  show up  no I'm going  we're all going  tonight I'm serious  we're all going to  go see Dane  it's going to be a  kick-ass show  tonight definitely  without a doubt  all right more with  Dane Cook  also on the way  we got Martha  Stewart and  P. Diddy  rapping together  oh this is  we got to do this 
[02:03:00]  while you guys  are in the studio  today  he you know  he I keep saying  wow that guy's got  no street cred  but he lost it  so long ago  when now though  when he's rapping  and teaching Martha  Stewart how to  rap words  and he  he's got his own  line of craftsman  tools that he just  released  yo let me tell you  about my wrench  that's the snoop  the snoop with the  golfing  snoop is the worst  let me tell you  it locks on to the  nut  it's wonderful  rap is where like

[02:07:30]  show  oh hey you  well guess who's back  it's the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the O.B. and Anthony  show  all right  very very busy day  on the O.B. and Anthony  program today  Bill Burr in studio  definitely want to  remind people  Bill's half hour  comedy special 
[02:08:00]  on HBO  is tonight  at midnight  make sure you check  out Bill Burr  I'll be here  tomorrow night  at midnight  too  well I got the  on demand  so I'll be watching  it's Sunday morning  when I wake up  in your slippers  and of course  Dane Cook  playing Madison Square  Garden tonight  it's a nice little  room  not bad  Jesus Christ  playing the garden  where is that  it's no Carnegie Hall  but it's  no one's got to ask that  I'm playing the  chuckle hut  where is that  I'm playing the garden  is that the  what garden  the fucking garden 
[02:08:30]  that's fantastic  I think last time  who said it  it's great to not have  the words ha ha  in the phone number  oh that's good  and of course  the CD slash DVD  is called  Retaliation  Dane Cook  selling like  hotcakes  yes  were hotcakes  ever really selling  was there like  a time in history  when hotcakes  were just  just for that  saying to be there  there must have been  one time  where like  we're fresh out  again  Jesus  they just sold  comedy clubs  really do have  some of the worst  fucking names  I worked to play  side splitters  side splitters 
[02:09:00]  why don't you just  call it knee slappers  gay club that I had  to play years ago  remember Fiddlesticks  did we play that  Fiddlesticks  then I'll be at  Gaffaws  we had to take a break  just to take leaks  and stuff  but the stuff that  was happening  during the break  was really entertaining  as well  Dane met the lead  singer of Missing Persons  Bill was talking  about Scary Spice  oh opening up  for Wynonna Judd  just talking about  Wynonna Judd  outside at a racetrack  at like 12 noon 
[02:09:30]  at a racetrack  the cars or horse  what was it  a horse  it was like a horse track  and I'm standing up  there just bombing  you can't shit on the crowd  because it's her audience  and you don't  you need the gig  at that point  so you're doing it  and I'm standing there  there's people  kind of filing in  and there's this lesbian  biker looking chick  my whole set  she's just standing there  chanting  Wynonna  Wynonna  oh god  and you just want to be  you fucking whore  you just want to go off on her  and you can't  you got to be actually  cordial 
[02:10:00]  how do you do that  like a game show host  how do you not  first of all  have a nervous breakdown  before you go out on stage  and how do you even  step out onto that stage  that's where you comics  I don't even know  people ask me  they go  why don't you try stand up  are you insane  to have to do  something like that  where you know  the gig is a  fuck it's noon  at a horse racetrack  to a crowd  that wants to see  Wynonna Judd  and you actually  make your legs  work  and walk out  onto a stage  I literally learned 
[02:10:30]  how to bomb gracefully  on that gig  I'll never forget  I was sitting there  I was just eating my balls  just feeling like an asshole  and somewhere in the middle of it  I swear to god  I just started imagining  Patrice O'Neill  Keith Robinson  and Jim Norton  sitting in the back  watching me  laughing at me  and I somehow started  laughing at myself  how fucking ridiculous  I mean I was in the middle  of my set at one point  out of nowhere  they all just go  ah  screamed  and I'm like  you know  I thought my fly was down  I turned around  way in the background  it was a carnival  and some guy 
[02:11:00]  was on that ride  where you get shot  into the fucking air  and I guess that went up  up and over me  from behind  I just started doing  this self-deprecating  how pathetic  my career was  and I was able  to handle that lady  in a roundabout way  called her a lesbian  which of course  the whole country audience loved  I said something  about her haircut  how short it was  and people knew  what I was alluding to  so you know  country people  fuck the queers  I got them on my side  but no  it was just  it was brutal 
[02:11:30]  I just  I have no clue  how you do that  that's what I do now  anytime  I just picture  Dane  I'll picture somebody  I know  just laughing  yeah  that's a good one  that's how you  you got through  like the beginning ones  like as you're going  going up at the  fucking bell rick in 99  and the game's on  it's like  I've been watching him bombing  and it's like  you want to laugh  but it's like  you know you're going up there too  it's like you got an ass kicking coming  so you're almost  you're almost jealous  like fuck  these guys love  he's going to be done 
[02:12:00]  he's getting it over with  he's halfway through it  these guys love  when they're on bomb  that's the one thing I learned  you know hanging out  with a lot of comedians  you guys love  when someone's eating  yeah  it's almost  absolutely  it's like sport to you guys  oh yeah  it's fair game  with each other  it's almost like  you know the way black guys  can call each other  the n-word  and like it's cool  like comics can be like  dude you stink  you bombed  and it's like  yeah it was good huh  but anybody else says it  do you know  do you know like  the worst heckle  like you've ever gotten  do you keep that on tap  like the worst thing  that anybody's ever yelled 
[02:12:30]  oh yeah  the most bizarre one  I ever got  I was at Dangerfield's  third show  on a Saturday night  there's like fucking  30 people there  that place is  the worst to do comedy  so there's these three  angry white dudes  in the back  and you just can feel  the rage  ghosts are walking out  during your set  it looks like a funeral home  man  I know  it's like  you just feel the rage  in these guys  and I hear them talking  and I know they're  fucking talking about me  and I'm like  dude don't go there  don't talk to them  I just  after a while  I just couldn't  I finally just said  you guys 
[02:13:00]  what's your problem man  you're just  you're just talking  you know  what's going on  and this dude  this most bizarre  heckle ever  he goes  anything red  and on stage  is a faggot  and it was just  it was so fucking bizarre  I didn't even have  a comeback to it  what the hell is that  but it was like  brilliant  and I was sitting  there going  like  and he was so angry  the way he said it  I knew if I just said  one thing back to him  I had a fist in my face  so I somehow  had to just go back  into my act 
[02:13:30]  so I got a computer  recently  and just completely  blew it off  I had a guy  at Dublin's  one night  he was sitting  in the front row  and he was really  really despondent  and he's drunk  and he's talking  to himself  and he turned  his chair  away from the stage  but he's right up front  so he's facing the crowd  he's like doing  little monologues  to himself  and trying to  like the show's on him  and I  same thing  I'm like dude  what's your problem  what's your problem  three or four times  and he keeps  like shrugging me off  and I finally  I go  really man 
[02:14:00]  what is your problem  and he stands up  and the whole place  goes quiet  because he's holding  a bottle in his hand  I think somebody  thought he was  going to throw it  and he goes  I've got seven problems  and you're five of them  wow  that's really  fucking genius  did he name them  did he name the five  no he never even  got into it  we did actually  get into a little  I think I  we had a little  fight up front  why are those people there  like I don't get  why they're even there  I've been to comedy clubs 
[02:14:30]  and I've seen comics  that just have sucked  and you sit  and wait for the next guy  it's that  why  why do people feel compelled  you fucking suck  you're an asshole  I'll tell you  what are the best  like you go up  in front of an all black crowd  it's like  what I quickly learned  is they're gonna have fun  with you  or without you  so either  you make them laugh  it's the way  you bomb in front of a black crowd  it's like  the joke bombs  there's nothing  and then everybody laughs  that it got nothing  I remember one time  just  mixed nuts 
[02:15:00]  in LA  just eating my balls  and it's all black crowd  so I do some jokes  ba-da-ba-da-ba-da  nothing  and then I see this big black lady  in the background  and goes  wah-wah-wah  and then they all just  start fucking laughing  and once again  I don't address it  I go into my neck  so I fucking  oh just  dry mouth  and it's even worse  and it's even worse  when you're making the  oh yeah  sound on the mic  yeah and you forgot  to bring water up  and it's just  oh it's the worst  I just remember gigs  where nothing was happening  and I could just hear  that fucking Patrice laugh  from the back of the room 
[02:15:30]  where it would be like  that same kind  because he has that kind of  yeah  Patrice can actually  make you bomb  I've had crowds  liking me  he didn't like the joke  and he's so fucking loud  and intimidating  he would get a crowd  to turn on you  oh what's that shit  yo Bill's up there  he's talking about  this motherfucker  just said  and the whole crowd  is turning around  and no one's gonna  tell him to shut up  and then you start  yelling at him  and then all of a sudden  the white guy's yelling  at the big black guy  this is racism 
[02:16:00]  and then you lose  all the white people  in the crowd  and he can literally  turn around  a good set  that is true  let's go to the phones here  Andy has a question  Andy what's up  Andy  hey  no  nothing  you  his name's not Andy  it's probably like  somebody else  Andrew  and he thinks it's  or Anthony  or  the guy that has  a question  for Dane Cook  about a corporate gig  no  no nothing  alright  he wanted to ask you 
[02:16:30]  if you were  fired from a corporate gig  like there might be  a story there  is there urban legend  out there about that  no you know what  no I'll tell you what it is  because I was hired  to do these two corporate gigs  and I just did the first one  out in LA  and I never  I never  I never do them  you know what I mean  no because it's just like  you don't really  you don't really enjoy it  you feel rented  you feel like a part of the  you know  you really do  it's just  so I agreed to do it  because they were  really enthusiastic  you came with the tent  oh yeah  one of those floppy arm  dolls that's behind you 
[02:17:00]  on stage  like you know  come by a car  and so  ugh  I agreed to do it  oh  hold on  hold on  go ahead Barry  what happens  these corporate gigs  they like  they always overpay  they completely overpay  they'll send private jets  they'll do whatever  it's like  whatever it takes  whatever it takes  and so it's  it's always hard to  turn down  yeah  to walk away from those things  so I'm like  you know what  I'll do it  I haven't done one in years  and it's two gigs  and the money's fucking great  so I go down  and the first thing 
[02:17:30]  I always say  the second I walk into  any gig  you know what I do on stage  you got the material  you've heard the CD  oh yeah  we all listen to it  that's what I'm going to do tonight  they even have to sign a waiver  to do it  so I do the show  I do my show  you know exactly the same way  and the crowd's laughing  they're into it  actually you know  I didn't think it was going to  it wasn't so bad  they weren't  but of course the president  of the deal comes up  but you got a full standing ovation  at the end  I know  I mean the show was good  for that environment  and then they came up 
[02:18:00]  and they're like  we just want to talk to you  about the content  oh boy  the president of the company  was not too enthused  and then I'm like  okay and he goes  if we make you a list  for the next show of things  and I was like  goodbye  I'm not the guy for you  obviously you should  you know call somebody  who can come in  and do what you need  but it's like  I gave you the shit  watch the stuff  you know what I mean  and if I'm not  now Dustin Diamond  is doing the gig  yeah  now I'm just kidding  I wouldn't have doubted it though 
[02:18:30]  so no  I wasn't fired  did you get paid for the whole thing  no I got paid for the first show  I told him  see you later  keep the other half  and it was a mutual walk away  you know someone's head rolled  for that too  you know someone got the axe  who was the head of entertainment  for that corporate gig  it was some missy  down in personnel  and it can literally be  just one little thing  and then they'll try  not to pay you  yeah  oh yeah  all kinds of things can happen  let's say hi to Sarah  get the Bacon Brothers  they'll do it  remember we saw  the Bacon Brothers  at one of those 
[02:19:00]  they're on morning TV  yesterday  promoting their singing thing  hey Sarah  what's up  hey guys  I was at the  Dane Cook  and Bob Kelly show  last night  granted it wasn't  Bob Kelly show  but  it was  so funny  my friend and I  had such a great time  and I just wanted to tell them  that you guys were awesome  and afterwards  it was  well we thought  it was pretty hysterical  these two fat chicks  come up to  my friend Britt and I  and  and they're like 
[02:19:30]  we just flirted our way in  and blah blah blah  and I looked at them  and I'm like  you look like you  got in because  you're one of  Mari Povich's  special children  they said  they flirted their way in  what to the  backstage or whatever  yeah  that's what they were  telling us  and  it was pretty funny  and also  Dane Cook  signed my friend's boobs  and Bob Kelly did too  oh very nice  sounds like a great night  for everybody  everyone had fun  we had so much fun  but we have to say  like  my friend and I  like we felt kind of bad  because you know  Dane Cook was like 
[02:20:00]  leaving in like a limo  or a town car  or whatever  and Bob Kelly was  getting in a minivan  I love it  I can't wait to get  Bob on the phone  that's perfect  we're trying to get  Bob on the phone  but I don't know  he's probably sleeping  or whatever  so  he sprained his wrist  closing that sliding  door on the van  yeah Bob's not here  Sarah  oh okay  well I've been  an ONA fan  since you guys  were on WNEW  my brothers got me

[02:22:30]  on that big  8 person circular  bicycle that rides  through Times Square  that you want to  fucking run over  when I'm driving  in the city  no there was nothing  there was a brand  new one though  it was brand new  he said I was the  first one ever  on that bike  who cares  you don't ever want  to be seen in that  thing  well what was I  going to do  walk  do you stop  to listen to the  guys play the  spackle buckets too  I'm sorry I didn't  have a limo  pick me up at my  five star hotel  you're not a fancy  man  hey Bob we learned  a lot about you 
[02:23:00]  today thanks to  Dane Cook  you used to have  very long hair  oh shit  looking like  what did you say  Crystal Gale  oh yeah he's  great reference today  Crystal Gale  he had long long  luxurious hair  remember that Bobby  fucking Crystal Gale  I called you  Crystal Gale  man  and you used to  play the punch in  the asshole game  yeah but that was  Dane invented that  he came up to me  one time and just  punched me in the  asshole  and say I just  shit my pants  and then you ran  with it  and what do you do  afterwards I made  that up 
[02:23:30]  what do you say  that's mine  I trademark it  I sell it on my  website  you can buy a kit  it's a home game  but Dane you had  long hair too man  yeah I had kind of  the mullet thing  going  there's a picture of  you on the internet  bro  me and you both  at the same time  we looked like  Charlie's Angels  there was a time  there was a time  when the mullet  wasn't the mullet  no it wasn't  it was just a haircut  it was a feather  Dennis Miller had that  haircut for a long time 
[02:24:00]  that's what it was  and then it like  turned into this  mullet  where all of a sudden  to have it was to be  just some  backwards  cross-eyed hick  at a car show  or something  I gotta say though  Dane's hair was  beautiful in conditions  mine was nappy  and curly  I do say that  Dane had better hair  than me  Dane you remember  that time we picked  up those two chicks  at the beach  oh my  the witches  oh my  me and Dane  picked up two witches  from Salem  at the beach 
[02:24:30]  but Dane was always  a conservative type  of kid  and I was always  like the creepy  I want to lick  somebody's ass  like they had like  knife scars  on their face  Bobby's chicks  you know  yeah  so we wind up  going back  but I'm the one  always the aggressive  with the chicks  and Dane's kind of  laid back  kind of always had a chick  and I'm the one  you know  banging broads all the time  and talking about pussy  and we get back  and we get back to this  their apartment  in Salem  and it's this  like this house  has been there  since 1702  and they're telling us  they take us in the basement  and tell us about the witches 
[02:25:00]  and I'm shitting my pants  we go back upstairs  they both get naked  start taking showers  yeah  I'm frantic  I'm frantic  Dane has the guitar  in his hand  and they come out naked  I'm like dude  what the fuck  are we gonna do  he goes Bobby  get your fucking shit together  and just starts playing a song  on the guitar  he knows how to work it  get the guitar out  start playing a little  but Bobby's like  they're doing spells in there man  they're putting spells on us  or something dude  he was so concerned  that they were trying to  really put some kind of 
[02:25:30]  how much coke  had he done to paranoia himself  of that much  yeah  when it comes time to gameplay  Dane really is the quarterback  get your shit together faggot  how you girls doing  do you ever hear this song  by Moody Blues  witchy woman  Moody Blues  this is Vixen's edge  of a broken heart  did you tell him  that you shit in a bucket  no  now we're in the  see now we're in the  yeah we're in the dirt  we're in the good stuff now  who  we're in the fucking tour  you can't shit on the tour bus 
[02:26:00]  yeah you're not allowed  to take craps on the tour bus  you're not allowed  to shit on the tour bus  whatsoever  that's good  we understand that  and so I'm sitting there  I'm on my computer  Dane goes in the bathroom  he comes out  he goes hey dude  check this out  he has a brand new  sterling silver  toilet bowl  and it's  it was the  it was so perfect  the shit  that I thought it was fake  there was no like  little  you had the wastebasket  he showed you the wastebasket  yeah I had the wastebasket 
[02:26:30]  probably  it was a whatever  Barry  shut your face  you're not my manager  alright  shut your mouth  well you did say that  you let him on the microphone again  I'll come down there right now  and punch him right in one tooth  it was a wastebasket buddy  listen  people are listening  I could do something for you  you're gonna be a big star  you're gonna be a big star  you broke your knee  this is gonna put you  on the map buddy  I'm thinking  if we could dislocate  your shoulder  I could  I could get you 
[02:27:00]  on Carson Daly  god that's how it works though  alright  so the shit in the wastebasket  it was perfect  you know my weak stomach  yeah  I didn't think it was real  oh no  but then  I look in again  and I just saw  a shit drip  and then his face  Bobby gets that face  when he's like  he wants to puke  but he starts getting that  like body in a river  for three days look  you know it was just like  bloated  his eyes look like a shark  they just like turn black 
[02:27:30]  and glazy  who shits in a bucket  well you got it  not on the bus  what a great rule that is though  because once someone  shits on that bus  it's over  well these guys  Anthony I agree with that  when you're doing 85  down some highway  but when you're parked  next to the college  and there's 98 toilets  5 feet away from you  there's no need  to shit in the bus  these guys locked me  I know you guys locked me  in the back room one night  I had the back 
[02:28:00]  you know back room  it was like a little  sliding door  and the bus was so dry  that I bought one of those  humidifiers  and so I have to  take a piss  at like 5 in the morning  we're moving  I get up  and the door is jammed  and I know these guys  have like pinned it  or done something  so I'll lay down  for like another hour  but now I've really got to go  and I'm like I'm back  I'm like come on guys  but the engine is  I say three hours later  I finally had to piss  in my humidifier  that's how bad it was  I had to piss  in my humidifier  and it's all on film  I hope you throw it away 
[02:28:30]  after that  the bus driver  what was his name again  Dan?  Brian  oh this guy  I love this  this guy was the biggest creep  I was out  I would wake up  in the middle of the night  and just go sit with him  like two weeks  into the tour  he starts yelling at me  he goes  what the fuck  kind of tour is this?  the fuck?  there's no alcohol  there's no fucking drugs  you guys on fucking whores  what the fuck  is you playing Xbox  you fucking bunch of faggots  what was wrong with that guy?

[02:42:30]  seven times for more information  phone number  and I'm sitting there  I know he's dangerous  so I'm going  uh  uh  Mr. Poe  why  are you asking me for this  oh that's just in case  um  Opie asked me to call  and you can't go take a hike  because it's something  I know he's big  under all of that garb  what the hell happened  he just has these skills  he's like a knife fighter  he knows how to do  all these things  I can tell  he's a Puerto Rican  with a mullet  that can't be  that has to be dangerous 
[02:43:00]  Patrice  I can tell you this much  Spanish mullets  I can tell you this much  we really don't know  why he's here  XM hired him  he works for XM  so we're wondering  what  what kind of threats  did XM get  that they had to hire  like a trained assassin  and put him in a lockup  dude he's our secretary  and he has a thousand  technically he's our secretary  where you know  he's dangerous  like you  you look at him  and go  oh my god  this guy is dangerous 
[02:43:30]  yeah  and he's just  and it just  and it takes long  but you're scared  to do this  they hired him  to train guys  at where  Quantico  yes  to train guys  to kill  with their hands  what's Quantico  Virginia  the uh  marine corps  they brought him in  to train them  to kill people  to train marine  marines  who already  pretty much  got a good hold  on how to kill people  they had to bring him in  to make him kill  better  more  or faster  and yeah  now he's in 
[02:44:00]  in control  of our listeners  coming by  with like  gifts  he's training killers  he's gonna take  stalker patty out  if she hacks up  I couldn't believe  I'm sitting there  trying to behave myself  I could not believe  what was going on  I thought  I thought it's cause  you hated me  but it's  absolutely not  but he  he thought it was like  canning cameras  it's a real deal  he took a picture  of my ID  this was  and then I see  the Quantico thing  I don't know  what Quantico was  but the Quantico  he's very proud of that  he's got that hanging up  he's got that hanging up 
[02:44:30]  in his little area  you just can look at him  and tell his name  you just look at him  Tyson did you get  Friston  no nothing see  see nothing happened  to Tyson  why Mr. Poe  okay well first of all  what's the difference  between these two guys  that I could think of  there's no difference  big guys  but he said hello Patrice  my good friend  from years ago  then he proceeded  to pummel me  you know  Tyson and you  are about the same size  big guys  I don't know  what the difference is  I think almost  the bigger  I think the bigger  the better 
[02:45:00]  for people  like he sizes you up  and I think he wants  you to be bigger  and in shape  so it makes him feel better  when he hurts you  feel a little better  how many bones  have you pushed up  into somebody's brain  no no  I'm not about violence  I'm really not here  to hurt you  I have to do a job  and I just wanted  to make sure  I just wanted to make sure  that I got all the information  from you  in which I did  yeah but you had no problem  when the superior race guy  walked right through  well let's go  no no no

[02:49:30]  I'm here talking  I'm throwing out  probably some of the  funniest stuff  of my career  and the mic was off  dude I did not  touch that mic  it's gonna take  two years for him  to get out the  I'll show you guys  stage  he's at that stage  I'll show you guys  watch this  I've been humbled  trust me I've been humbled  it's gonna take some time  to get back where I was  oh my god  but Ross is in  for a heartbreak  oh I can't wait  it's like any relationship  you take that chance  you know we're having  a good time  you know  like Gary Williams  listen  no we're gonna get  into a couple things 
[02:50:00]  but go ahead  I mean you know  you went out  and bought a swing  for sex  oh it's great  do you really  who  Norton I think  brought that up  you have a sex swing  what happened to you  you went down to Brazil  and you lost your mind  calm down  he's choking  uh oh  that was two  see I told you  I'd come back  can I explain something  about that sex swing  and all these things  is that a tear  yeah  jeez  can I just say 
[02:50:30]  I realized something  about myself  and about sexuality  yes  I delve deep  deep into  into sexual  deviants  deeper and deeper  right  I stopped  and you know  what it was causing  this serious moment  condoms  because it's very hard  to keep it up  with the condoms  on for me  and I realized  that I had to get  I had to go deeper  and deeper  into this visual  dirt baggishness  to keep it up  oh  with a condom  on  so I went raw  for the first time  in a long time 
[02:51:00]  like a month ago  and I  and I had regular sex  for the first time  in a long time  so I've stopped  some of this stuff  some of it  you're back to appreciating  normal  I'm back to normal  sex  but  the girls  that I have  brought down with me  and still around  no longer  want to do regular sex  so now I'm stuck  in this world of  ah  did you corrupt  them or something  I corrupted them  you did  they come over  they set the swing  up themselves  sit in it 
[02:51:30]  when you're swinging  like it's kind of like  you feel like you're  having sex in a tree  or something  like you swing  like a monkey  I didn't say it like that  stop it boss  that was  that is brutal  that was very underhanded  I'm telling you  you know what it is  he gives all his  funniness that he  would have had  to her  he would have  like a life tap  just grabbing any  bit of boss  that has any shine to it  he headlines  and then he brings her  on after him  but it all started 
[02:52:00]  with Brazil  you went down there  one time  and you just lost  your mind  Norton's been telling  all the Patrice stories  for the last  four months  I don't understand  what it is  is  there's a bunch  of us that go down  I know  he talks about  how you guys  all sit around  with heart-ons  because you're  all on Viagra  waiting to go upstairs  I have a heart attack  on Viagra  Norton is sitting  there sweating  like a dirty  little stress doll  with his robe  and he's packing  like a monster  wood for a wormy  kid  so it's a strange  thing  we've all seen it  I saw it once 
[02:52:30]  I was like  Jesus  it is kind of  Opie  are you still  in a relationship  thanks for bringing  it up  no it's over  I've been trying  to get him to come  man  change your lives  man  it's not what you  think  it's not just  yeah but honestly  we have discussed  this openly  on the show  I don't get  the hooker thing  and I'm not just  I'm not playing  a game  I've never got  into it  I never got  into the hookers  and I never  really got into  the lap dancing  because with me  I need to feel  like the girl  actually wants me  and when I just 
[02:53:00]  know they're doing  it for money  or for whatever  reason  I'm so out  of the game  are they still  hot to look  at and all that  of course  as a human being  visually I'm like  wow that's hot  but as far as  doing anything  I'm like no man  I need someone  to kind of  want me  that's the  at the time  when I was  explaining it  y'all weren't  here for me  to explain it  to you  I would explain  it to you  first  it's not  about the  hookers out  there  they will  make you  feel like  that  you are  buying that  you are  buying that  when you  you're gonna  buy into  that 
[02:53:30]  no way  I'm telling you  Norton almost had  a girlfriend  from it  remember that  he fell in  love  Norton got  dumped  by a  prostitute  he got  dumped  by a  prostitute  Norton was  dumped  by a  prostitute  oh man  wow  he gets his  feelings hurt  out there  yeah but here's  the thing  you'll meet  somebody like  just reading  notes  no we got  Don Imus  calling us  today for  some reason  actually we  called  wow okay  we just looked  up at the  TV and we  saw Imus  in a really  bad pink  shirt so I  told Ben 
[02:54:00]  hey why don't  you call our  friend Imus  so now he's  gonna call the  show  that'd be cool  alright go  ahead so you  went down to  Brazil  yeah  you should go  did you think  it was gonna  be a one time  thing but now  you're kind of  hooked on the  whole Brazil  thing right  yeah  and so  isn't Norton  it's almost like  a relationship  and so isn't  others  that know  dude  forget about it  we know  I don't know  I would have  to say close  to a dozen  people that  I've seen  in comedy clubs  and here and  there that now  go like you  guys are dragging  new people in  all the time  it's the best 
[02:54:30]  it's the best  see look  first of all  let's get it  straight it's  dangerous out  there it's  really dangerous  sure in terms  of you know  violence and  in terms of  whatever there's  a whole bunch  of homeless  master pose  walking around  Brazil for no  reason at all  asking you for  money and the  girls are just  as dangerous but  they make you  feel a certain  you should go  just you know  what it is  it's just to  make you  understand what  a winner you  are here  you don't put  up with any  bullshit when  you come back 
[02:55:00]  here because  you go wait  a minute I  really am a  winner when  you go out  you feel  they make you  feel like that  because you buy  because if you  can't find a  free here  not the cooch  no one needs  to buy it  it's all kind  of their bags  walking around  a bunch of  losers  there's a lot  of losers  I've seen  myself  naked  look at  her  god damn  g-string  is up  over by  her neck  she's a  mess  who are  those girls  there's a lot  of girls  who sleep  with me  for free  and I  look at  myself 
[02:55:30]  naked  and I  go why  and then  that makes  me  not like  them more  because I  go why  would you  sleep with  me  I would  never  give me  wow  so it  always  it's  already  a problem  yeah  but you  go out  there man  and those  girls  because the  fact that  it takes  the pressure  off  the sex  the pressure  of the  hunt  the pressure  or whatever  that's why  guys get  girlfriends here  because they  don't want to  deal with  all of the  nonsense of  getting a  girl  you go there  and you  know you  can have  this gorgeous  girl so you  really interact 
[02:56:00]  very well with  them man  it's a  sincere thing  I learned  how to speak  portuguese  it's fantastic  I barely speak  english  how many times  a year you  go down  now  twice  oh that's it  I thought it was  more  twice  twice a lot  they teach kids  to be prostitutes  almost at  like  oh jesus  stop it  I'm a good  guy now  boss  why are you  guys letting  him do this  man  have I missed  out this much  what happened  we've been  off for a while 
[02:56:30]  it's kind of  hard to get  back into the  swing  why are you  allowing him  to do this  man  because he  got this  little phony  relationship  that's coming  to a complete  halt  I'm gonna  be there  to catch  you  so what  about the  aids in  brazil  you worried  about the  aids  and all  that  yeah  I'm worried  about the  aids  on 125th  did you bring  them down  here for  any specific  reason  I guess  they heard  I don't  know  I just  came down  to show  the guy  because I 
[02:57:00]  know Norton  talks about  it but I'm  getting tired  of hearing  that I'm  the only  dirtbag  getting the  whole  you know  here it  is with  Jimmy  he likes  to commiserate  with other  people  it's like  any other  addict  you know  they like  seeing other  people doing  the heroin  drinking  you know  and with  him  he's such  a degenerate  he's such  a sexual  just a  complete  dirtbag  that he  loves seeing  anyone else  even kind of  getting tied up  in the whole  thing  so he looks  at you  you go down  there  you find  something  you really  enjoy  you bring  some toys 
[02:57:30]  with you  all of a  sudden  oh that  Patrice  he's sick  he's a  disturbed  sick  individual  yeah  drop another  log on my  face  honey  yeah  oh Patrice  he's out  of his mind  isn't Norton gay  if you're  with a  transsexual  aren't you  gay  I would think  if you're  with a  tranny  there's got  to be  some kind  of  there's  something  going on  there  it's still  a guy  it's a  man  if you  don't  first of all  if you  don't make  out  okay  right there  you're not  gay  look at  these rules  he has  well Norton 
[02:58:00]  says if  you don't  push back  you're  not gay  push back  Norton's a  sissy  a sissy  so  Norton  wasn't  it's not fair  he's not here  to defend himself  I don't know  he was blowing  maybe a  transverse  so he  blew him  and he  didn't know  it was  an accident  you know  because some  of them  look good  and you  know  he said  he put  his hand  on her  back  and as  he's  rubbing  her back  he noticed  it was a  very wide  strong back  but he  let him  finish  and then 
[02:58:30]  said he  had to  wash off  man breath  off of  himself  is it  worse for  your career  to say  you're  gay  or say  somebody  takes a  dump  on your  chest  that's a  good point  we're still  figuring that  out  taking a dump  on your chest  doesn't destroy  your career  being gay  is  I think  if you had  to choose  between the  two  you still  have to  go with  the dump  on the  chest  I think  it's all  geographic  why  you think  gay  ruins  your career  I think  it depends  on where  you're  unless  you're  Ellen  Degeneres  in Hollywood  depends on  where you  are  how many  breaks we  have left  one more  and that's  it  alright  we'll just  try to  keep 
[02:59:00]  going  well you  brought the  sex toys  in  are these  girls  going  well if  they don't  do  nothing  we  look  I'm just  curious to  see these  things  because  I've heard  they're  finally  cracked  two  cases  like CIA  it's  like he's  carrying  the bomb  you go  down to  Brazil  with these  things  look I  want to  engage  in evil  every  day  that I'm  there  I can't  take that  Viagra  that stuff  will kill  you  so  to get  the good 
[02:59:30]  rods  you have  to go  down  this  path  the  regular  sex  to you  is  like  whatever  you need  some  craziness  involved  so you  taking  these  toys  and  using  them  on  chicks  gives  you  that  visual  thing  that  gets  you  that's  why  I  have  glass  it's  very  safe  get  the  cases  I  would  love  to  see  really  fast  you  want  to read  this  we told  you guys  Patrice  we'll get  back to  you in  one second  we have  so much  crap going  on here  today  we told  you guys  Hot 97  the tsunami  song that  we finally 
[03:00:00]  get dragged  into this  whole mess  yeah  and we got  an update  from Inside  Radio  Inside Radio  reporting  there's an  Opie and  Anthony  connection  to the  Hot 97  tsunami  song  mess  and that's  the headline  Opie and  Anthony  connection  the producer  of  Miss  Jones  show  on  Hot 97  is  Rick  Delgado  who  produced  Opie and  Anthony's  show  for  WNAW  until the  infamous  Sex and  St.  Pat  stunt  now  Delgado  Miss  Jones  and the  rest  of  Hot 97  morning  crew  are on  indefinite  suspension  for airing  the  We Are  the World  parody  that uses  racial  terms  against  Asians 
[03:00:30]  we're  not  saying  that  Rick's  responsible  for what  happened  in either  controversy  but he  probably  feels  he's been  at ground  zero  two times  too  many  and  then  they  go  into  meanwhile  McDonald's  pulled  its  ads  off  in  Hot 97  followed  by  tax  prep  firm  Jackson  Hewitt  and  Sprint  also  an  online  petition  demands  that  Emma's  fire  the  entire  morning  show  has  now  gathered  over  30,000  signatures  and  there's  that  demonstration  at  Hot 97  Hudson  Street  Studios  this  morning  at  11  o'clock 
[03:01:00]  Emma's  faces  some  tough  choices  if  the  noise  level  doesn't  diminish  soon  so  Rick  and  us  getting  tied  into  the  whole  thing  we  said  they  would  drag  our  names  into  it  somehow  and  we  have  nothing  to do  with  this  no  nothing  go find  your  mommy  oh is that  the worst  song  parody  he was  producing his  morning show  we think he wrote  the song  but we have  nothing to do  with it  the other guy  that was supposed  to be my job  how's your singing voice  would you have been  able to 
[03:01:30]  I would have said  no but that's  why I didn't  do it  you gotta raise  your hand  to talk  and everything  in there  and then  you gotta go  and then Rick  came in  and when I did it  hey man  you gotta raise  your hand  I'm like  what Rick  do you even know  he forgot you too  right  you have to  raise your hand  no bullshit  we have a messed up show  it's like  just everyone  we don't care  talk at the same time  no one gets  like credit here  we all just have fun  it's all about having fun  no egos or any of that 
[03:02:00]  raise your hand  that's why I love you guys  thank you  okay I'm gonna  I'm gonna go out  on my character  and really kiss your ass  your mouth is full of food  I know  you let  yeah  you let  people be funny  talk for  exactly  I'm telling you  you can't have more fun  on anything else  than this  yep  okay  is that good enough  that's very good  ass kissing  because there's a lot of people  that have egos  and they're  they're self-conscious  and stuff  and they  at the end of the day  have to be the funniest person  on their radio show  and Anthony and I  figured out a long time ago 
[03:02:30]  you know  Patrice is killing today  Voss is killing today  when I go talk to my people  after today  they're gonna all say  wow that was a  you guys were really funny today  no  well maybe we were a little bit  but you killed today  we still get the credit  for having a funny show  and Anthony was funny  I'm raising my hand  nice visual  I'm not lying dude  raise your hand  when I came in there  because I knew her  and I came in there  and she sort of treated me  like Opie treated me today  I wasn't that bad  when I came in  I was just distracted  we're gonna do an interview 
[03:03:00]  and you know  I was sitting in this chair  I went to sit in there  she came in and goes  that's somebody else's chair  didn't even say hi  I go hey baby  hey baby  right at me  so I was okay  I see how this is gonna be  so they were trying to treat me  like the new kid  at the high school  so now you know  how do you work in that environment  how do you have any fun  don't find your mommy  yeah  wow  we don't know what's gonna happen  we thought they were gone  screaming chinks  what  we thought they were gonna fire them  but it looks like they're gonna  I don't know  I think they're gonna try 
[03:03:30]  to ride the storm  that'll probably fire  I think they'll fire  Friday's always the fired day  what's that  what is indefinite suspension  what's that code  is that code for fired  or code for  code for fired  indefinite suspension  is code for  they're already fired  we just have to figure out  what to do with  their contracts  who we're putting in here  that they're done  and there is no  trace of them  on the website  yeah  oh they're gone  off the website  that's a biggie  and McDonald's  pulls their ads  that tax firm  pulled their ads  Sprint Telephone  pulled their ads  and they pulled their ads 
[03:04:00]  for an indefinite period of time  until they said  big changes are made over there  they want them fired  sponsors definitely  control radio programs  a lot of people  talk about the FCC  it's like  well yeah  gotta worry about that  a little bit  and fines  but you gotta worry  about the big sponsors  when these sponsors  are a lot more  these Asians  ran to McDonald's  and said  look what you're  advertising on  you know  get off of there  oh my god  and people don't  listen to Asians  they're not  like the top  getting you fired  no getting people riled  black people are the best  Jews, blacks  and then Latinos 
[03:04:30]  blacks are better than Jews  blacks are better than Jews  at getting people fired  no  because the Jews fire you  at raising a ruckus  at raising a ruckus  blacks don't get you fired  as well as Jews do  I think if you make  a racial epithet  or a racial comment  a derogatory racial comment  on TV or radio  and it's against blacks  or Jews  blacks will get you in trouble  faster than Jews will  but blacks don't get you fired  black people go  okay  blacks complain to the people 
[03:05:00]  that own the companies  which are the Jews  and then the Jews fight  I can't argue with that  I mean you know more than me on that  but I just never felt like  we'd get people fired  Jews take it a little easier  they're like you know  Jews are more passive  you know  and Wasp heard about this thing  this is the thing  the Chinese people  and then all the O'Reilly's  and the Hannity McCombs  they don't have it  O'Reilly's such a hypocrite  O'Reilly's an ass  he really is an ass  I bought some of these dildos  from O'Reilly  exactly  he loves it  now these things  USA has to love you  these dildos  you just open this thing up 
[03:05:30]  like James Bond  I know  a suitcase of stuff  Q gave him  dude  he's got you know  he's got suitcases  with combination locks on them  if you put that into something  then it's  the Arab  the Arab security guard  downstairs winked at me  and said  is this  is this going down now  oh that's great  alright partner  I gotcha  why are these glass  why are they glass  because it's safer  and where do you get  glass dildos from  from the glass dildo shop 
[03:06:00]  how much do you spend  on that  glass dildos are rough  is there  I have thousands of dollars  worth of sex  I really did go  and look  I can't argue  the loneliness man  well I know  this looks like  the missing scene  from Pulp Fiction  when Marsalis Wallace  opens the briefcase up  the tree sitting there  next to the glowing dildos  and somebody should read off  some bible terms  to me  and then shoot me for this  and you will know  when my glass dildo 
[03:06:30]  goes inside you  that I am the lord  when I lay my dildo  upon thee  maybe the dildo's the shepherd  and I'm the righteous man  and you're snatch  and I got  and the thing is  I don't corrupt it  you know  you know  you corrupt  a few girls  and they get  they love it  yeah  and it just gets deeper  and deeper  and they trust me 
[03:07:00]  that when I bring  weirder and weirder stuff  they had trusted me  from the weird stuff before  so they're like  I got nipple  things  you put a nipple on  and suck the nipple in  which I don't get  but  they're in  wow  that is odd  Voss is holding it  with his sleeve  because he doesn't want  to touch it  yeah okay come on  how do you clean those  do you boil them  yeah  it looks like a popsicle stick  what do you get one of those  girls in here to try it  you clean them well  you know what I'm saying  because they're glass  are you scared  this will chip off  into the  nah man  it's not as  it's pyrex anyway  you're not beating them 
[03:07:30]  with it  what the hell's on the other  look at that  what gets me is  how do you follow that  you don't  like he said  it's you don't  it's like  the thing he just said  is always in context  right  the dude just said  he doesn't bother comics  because he's going to end up  getting the credit  for the situation  yeah yeah  this  I get credit for their  orgasms  this is not  I'm not following this  I'm just attached  she's attaching me  to the whole  the whole process  yeah the process  you can't follow it  another guy can't follow it  there's all sorts of  different sizes  we got to explain  because it's radio  all different sizes 
[03:08:00]  of glass dildos  different colors  this one is  this one by far  that's the McDaddy  with the handle  this one by far  is the top  this is my  this is my headliner  this is the trooper  alright that's the headliner  which one's your Voss  this is the Voss  believe it or not  really  yeah  doesn't seem to satisfy  that gets booed  all the time  this one spits  on itself  that one's good 
[03:08:30]  at bringing up  the other one  but this one  the other place  this is the headliner  for other places  this is the headliner  for  wow you put that one  in the back door  for those who enjoy  oh my  and that one  with the handle  now that's ribbed  all the way down  right  oh this is  that is just  do you open up  the briefcase  and then let the lady  pick a weapon of choice  you don't ever give women  a choice in sex dude  no  no  you don't give them

[03:22:30]  confined environment  with a bunch of  volatile personalities  all of whom think  that their opinion  is the most valid  you can pretty much  last a few months  before you want to go  on a fucking shooting  rampage  die  die  die  so we're taking  a little time  for ourselves  to decompress  and regroup  until then  enjoy the worst  of Opie and Anthony  or go outside  you're all pretty much  shut-ins anyway  the Opie and Anthony show  it's the best  the best  of the worst  of the comedians 
[03:23:00]  of the Opie and Anthony show  just hilarious  I'm sorry  yeah  really funny  really awful too  by the way  I'll acknowledge that  holy mother of god  now presenting  comedian  Mark Maron  uh Mark Maron's  in studio  yes  oh thank god  hi  how are ya  good  let me take my nicotine gum  out of my mouth  oh you got that going  for yourself there  trying to quit  trying to quit  I haven't smoked a cigarette  in seven years  that's a pathetic part of it  he's still chewing the gum  have you been on the gum  for seven years  no no 
[03:23:30]  I don't know what the hell  happened man  I haven't been smoking  cigarettes in seven years  and then at some point  I picked up a cigar  like Colin  you know  I'm like  I didn't smoke cigars  and I'm like  I'm smoking four a day  and my entire life  is built around cigars  and where are they  how do I get them  how do I get more  I got things coming  in the mail bundles  it's ridiculous  so now I'm on nicotine gum again  20 pieces a day  to get off the cigars  I don't know what to do with it  just so I feel better  I don't know  I'm just putting things  in my mouth to feel better  what does the nicotine gum do  it just fills you up  with nicotine  it's beautiful  I'm lit up right now 
[03:24:00]  because of gum  and now they got in flavors  I'm all set  flavored nicotine gum  yeah  if I had an IV unit  with nicotine  I would roll in here with it  see you know what it is though  I don't think the nicotine  was why I smoked  I just enjoyed  the whole ritual  of smoking  of searing your lung tissue  with hot smoke  yeah exactly  yeah that's the good feeling  when you wake up  and you're like  your lungs aren't supposed  to make that noise  I'll just burn through it  with a cigarette  then I'll feel better  just plow through it  with some hot smoke 
[03:24:30]  blast through the blockage  and start anew  yeah you gotta just burn off  the fog that's in your lungs  right  and it feels like  you're actually doing something  you look forward to it man  I mean when I smoked  I used to get up  I'd have like a triple expresso  I had like four cigarettes  and my body would just  deplete all its energy  processing toxins  I have to go to bed again  literally I was exhausted  I was sweating and exhausted  after five minutes  yeah  it was always about  like having a cigarette  though and a drink  or something  you know  after eating  cigarette sex  something like that  cigarette and driving  yeah yeah 
[03:25:00]  yeah cigarette  but I think it was more than  it's not something gum  could take the place of  really with me  it became this thing  where you know  and I used to do drugs  so I know what the  commitment to it is  and I feel  like I feel bad honestly  for people who've never  been addicted to anything  because they're the real losers  because on some level  they just don't know  what it's really like  to want something  you know  and get it  again and again  and again  until they're sick  and have to stop  that's passion  I didn't quit doing drugs 
[03:25:30]  because I didn't enjoy them  I quit because I couldn't  handle the commitment  so what happened was  is that these cigars  I didn't realize  what was happening  because I'm not a cigar snob  I don't care  I'd smoke them alone  I don't care if anyone sees me  and I'm just sitting there  in my own house  plowing through these cigars  and I realized  like this is an hour  of just you know  nicotine distribution  you could sit there  for an hour  and you just become  like a nicotine sponge  so it wasn't even  the oral thing  or anything else  it was just like  I need this stuff  in my body  at all times  and the gum  is the way to go  right now  yeah  yeah because I was  inhaling the cigars 
[03:26:00]  you feel disgusting  my hands  wow you were inhaling  the cigars  a little bit  my hands were getting numb  I was having chest pains  I'm like  is this how I want to go out  really  is this how  I want to go out  with a cigar in my mouth  I want to be that guy  and you rationalize it though  you know Jim  because you're thinking like  hey Milton Berle  smoked cigars his whole life  so I'm like Milton Berle  he's still alive  he lived in 90  you always find that one guy  who out survived everybody  in your barometer  and that's going to be  the benchmark  exactly  that's my guy  Milton Berle  if you have to follow a guy  you might as well  you know  pick someone like that  yeah exactly 
[03:26:30]  not the guy  that had his jawbone  cut off  at 22 years old  what's the follow  I don't want to hear  that's what was killing me  I'm sitting there going  I think my jaw is a little sore  I think I did it  I think it's over  oh you got it  I start like opening my mouth  looking for purple spots  it's ridiculous  how long have you been on the cigars  I was on  why you think it's over  you think I'm done  no no  Colin was going through them  I know  I know  nonstop  I remember when he was on that  and then I got into that situation  because when he got heads like ours  he got this idea that like  I'll just smoke one on Saturday 
[03:27:00]  and then two days later  you're smoking five  and I don't know how the hell it happened  as I'm listening to Mark talk  I haven't smoked in five years  you want to smoke  dude I'm dying for a cigarette right now  no don't even think about it  no I won't touch the nicotine  it'll pass  but I'm just saying  listening to somebody describe the Jones  he's describing it like it's a bad thing  because it is  yeah  but it's like I'm such a sicko  I'm like god I would love a cigarette right now  you know  it's like your soul is itching  like something  you're inside your body  like scratching at your skin  and the only thing that's going to make it better  is a cigar or a cigarette 
[03:27:30]  but the gum will work for now  I'll figure out something else  hey now we were catching up  we haven't had you on the show in a while  and I was thinking to myself  why haven't we had Mark Maron on the show  you're hilarious  and we were catching up a little bit  and you said that your wife left you  oh well what happened was  she brought it to my attention  that I have an anger problem  but she said it differently  she said I'm leaving  wow  and she  you know  let me tell you  now is that why you're smoking the cigars 
[03:28:00]  dude it's  well right now  is it all related  no no  it was before that  I don't  this is the weird thing  it's like when that happens  after a few months  I'm looking at Jim  and I'm like I don't care  I'm over it  it's been a few months  and then when you see anybody  that might know you  have you seen her  did she say anything  oh Jesus  I don't know where she is  I don't know what she's doing  but I'll tell you man  I have never been hit that hard  I've never been  like I  I'm almost grateful  to be honestly heartbroken  because I need a new hour  and you know  and I got  and I got about 45 now 
[03:28:30]  and it's looking good  so whoever's expecting politics  at comics  forget it  it's going to be borderline  it's going to be rational misogyny  I think is what  yeah  what it's going to be  you've been very introspective  as a comic  Mark is not just political  you talk a lot about  your own dysfunction  which I always like  constantly  your own psychosis  well that was a misunderstanding  you know  I mean I was never really  a political comic  because you know  when you talk about that  when someone says  it's a political comic  you're like  well I think I'll watch TV then  because what is it  political comic  is a guy who does one liners  about things that people 
[03:29:00]  barely care about  I mean I'm always  pretty broad  you know comic  but yeah  so she takes off  I didn't see it coming  oof  I was deeply in love  with this person  and it was brutal  so you didn't  there was no hint  there was problems  in your marriage  well apparently she  I mean obviously  but you had no idea  and this came out  of the blue  well look you know  it's like  okay so I got  I'm a little angry  sometimes I wake up angry  what are you going to do  I mean I don't know  and it got out of hand  I'm not going to  I'm not going to  take that away from it  you know I do  I do have a little bit  of a rage issue  yeah  but over time 
[03:29:30]  I thought we were working on  we were going to  couples counseling  I'll be honest with you  if you're in couples counseling  and you're a guy  that is basically  an ambush  that you pay for  you are paying somebody  to sit there  and witness your wife  call you an ass  over and over again  and for you to go  I know  I know  I know  and you just have to take it  well yeah  that's what I'm thinking  we can spend this money better  let's go to a dominatrix  you know  she can do me with a strap on  you can watch it  who knows  maybe I'll learn something  about myself  and we can broaden  our sexual horizons 
[03:30:00]  but we got to waste money  on this old Jewish lady  we go to this lady  who's supposed to be  an anger person  and this woman  who I'm seeing  that's the racket too  it's like  we're going together  she bolts  and then all of a sudden  the therapist is like  well I was on your side  anyways  why don't you keep coming  oh I get how this works  oh okay  so this woman  she's like  she's in her 60s  she can't hear well  so now I go in  it's ridiculous  I go in there  and I'm like  and you know  I think I'm feeling  a little sadness today  she's like why  I'm like  I'm feeling a little sadness  I don't know  you're glad 
[03:30:30]  what are you glad about  I'm sad  why are you sad  why are you yelling at me  why are you yelling at me  my mother yelled at me  and you're yelling at me  and she's like see  I think we made some progress  Mark were you guys  the same problem man  with the anger  it's like  were you yelling at her  or was it just like  she would watch you  raging at other people  and go  you're a psychopath  well here's the thing though Jim  it doesn't  you know  after a certain point  you know  look  I believe  and I believe this for a while  that if you want to get honest about it 
[03:31:00]  that if you're ever yelling at a woman  if you're ever yelling at a woman  and you know  if you're a rage guy  you know what it means  you feel it coming  and you're like  don't do it  it's not that important  that she didn't move the pencil  you know what I mean  that whatever the hell  you're about to lose it about  and you feel it happen  and you're in it man  it's like drugs  it's like anything else  and you're just like  you're in it  you can't think about it  and you know  there's no happiness  until she's crying  and it's bad  Jesus Christ  there's no happiness  until she's crying  do you ever avoid her apology  because you're like  I like the anger so much 
[03:31:30]  sometimes  like you want to keep the anger  and she tries to say sorry  and you're like  I don't want to hear it  I want to be mad  but it's not that  it's because you don't believe her  you know  you don't believe it  that when they're apologizing  like well why'd you do that  I think generally  you feel like you've been disrespected  somehow if you're yelling at them  I would yell at her  or to her  or you know  but it wasn't  the thing was  is I was working hard on it  and I really  what I was going to say  is I believe that  if you're ever yelling at a woman  99% of the time  all you should be saying is  why can't you be my mommy  why  why can't you be my mommy  why aren't you my mommy 
[03:32:00]  you know  so if you  if you just say that instead  maybe it'll disarm it a little bit  we can understand what's going on  but ultimately what happened  is even though  you know  we were working it out  or I was trying to work on it  that she had filled with my bile  and she'd you know  gotten enough resentment  to make a case against me  and when she saw her opportunity  she took off  and it's awful  when someone leaves  because you realize  there's no way  to leave  there's no way  to do it gracefully  you know  if you're going to leave  you leave  it's like one day  I get home  she picks me up  from the airport  she says I love you  she takes me home  she says I'm leaving  and you know  and she leaves  and how else is she going to do it 
[03:32:30]  wait she dropped  she took you  you came back  from a gig or something  she took you home  yeah I've been away for a week  took me home  and uh  came in the house with you  or just dropped you off  came in the house  you know  she's like  how was everything  was all our stuff  packed and ready to go  no nothing man  you know  she just said  I think I want a trial separation  what does that mean  and I'm like  yeah what the hell  what the hell is that  and you know  she's like yeah  and then she just walks out the door  right  and I'm like  what am I supposed to do  but  this is what she said  it was classic  she goes  well maybe you should call somebody  oh  I don't mean to laugh  no no no it's alright 
[03:33:00]  that sounds brutal  I want people to laugh  directly at my pain  that's right  I'm cutting out the middle part  the joke  I'm just inviting  I think jokes are for wussies  I'll just open my heart  and why don't you just pee in it  that's all  I think you should call somebody  that's kind of funny  I'm sorry  wow  that's why I'm here  that's brutal  it's brutal but also funny  yes go ahead  I want to see how Mark handles this  because believe me  I'm next  so I want to know exactly  what you're doing  so what happens to me 
[03:33:30]  I'll tell you man  when we go over  if we wait till we go over to XM  so we can talk about it  like men  I'll do it  with all the curse words  because I'm making some mistakes  and I didn't handle it well  and the arc of this thing  has been profound  because I'll be honest with you  I've not been  I don't know if I've ever been  in love with somebody  deeply  because this thing was like  this was a gut punch  because the horrible thing  you realize when this happens  it's like wait  I don't have complete control  over her  I don't 
[03:34:00]  you know you don't  you can't stop it  it's out of your hands  that's it  that's really what it's all about  how long were you together  eight years  eight years  married  granted when I met her  I was married and drunk  but  but  but you know  but  I was kind of doomed  from the beginning  but she did get me sober  and you know  it's alright  but  wow  oh so here's the thing  like you can't  you can't  there's only one way  to leave somebody  what was she going to do  what was she going to  like lead up to  like two weeks  give two weeks notice  you get the memo  I'm going to give you 
[03:34:30]  two weeks notice  and then  what about our stuff  it's still sitting in there  I've got a museum of her  in my house  and I don't  you know  oh that's terrible  it's  oh I remember this one  let's look at this exhibit  well yeah  at least it's not like  Ed Gein  she's not sitting in there dead  you know  it's on a stick  yeah yeah  you just yell at her  oh this is my wife  yeah yeah  oh man  but I guess I've got to  get this stuff out of the house  because it doesn't look like  it's coming back around  I was holding on  how long has it been  well it was 
[03:35:00]  we did the three months  and then I ended up  filing for divorce  because you know  you don't want to  it got  you got to do it first  well it wasn't even  a matter of being petty  it was just that  she was unwilling to decide  like she needed  she needed to do this for her  she felt overwhelmed  I got it  there's part of me  that's the thing  when you're like  when you're like us  you know  when somebody leaves  there was part of me  that I was angry  but there was part of me  that was like  well good for her  you know what I mean  that took a lot of guts  and I've been trying  to leave me for years  but apparently  it's just that simple 
[03:35:30]  you walk out  yeah I can't  I'm like I'm trying  but so it's been  at three months  she still didn't want to  she didn't know  and I was starting to drift  so what am I going to do  just sit here  and live in relation  to her indecision  and wait until she  would you guys talk  and stuff on the phone  yeah we tried  she didn't want to  but I did  and I was trying to be cool  and you know  I was trying to sort of  give her her space  but you know  it's very hard  when you're desperate  and in pain  and you're worried  about what they're doing  who they're talking to  well I mean  I wasn't too worried  about that  once I got past  once I really believed 
[03:36:00]  that it wasn't another guy  I just don't think it was  and you know  and after I followed her  around for four days  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  I didn't do that  I didn't do that  but it wasn't about that  she you know  what happened was  she got a book deal  she's writing a book  you know  she got some bread  and she was unhappy  she saw her window  she got out  you know  so she had a buffer  you know  so and that's  and that was it  I'm trying to be a mensch  about it  but some days  are better than others  and when we get over  to XM  I'll shit  alright cool  and it's interesting  that people think 
[03:36:30]  you're a political comic  I mean  your political stuff  is really really good  but I mean  you're  you talk about everything  man  yeah no I always do  your technology stuff  always makes me laugh  you did a whole  ringtone bit  when I saw you  at the comedy cell  I left my ass off  yeah I've always been that  it's just that  when I did the work  on Air America  you know  you get  that's why it got labeled  that's right  okay I remember  you used to be over there  right  and then you start to  and then people start to expect it  and I got fans that are like that  but I've always been pretty broad  yeah you're definitely a broad comic  I just want to get that word out there  it's the worst 
[03:37:00]  the worst  of Opie and Anthony  I personally recommend  you see Mark Barron  really really funny comic  yeah  a thinking man's comic  at times  yeah  and I need help  and he needs help  apparently  this is a weird thing now  where  I don't mind  given the state I'm in  sometimes audiences leave  and I like it  when they walk out  and say  that guy was hilarious  I really had a good time  but I'm okay with them  walking out going  you know I hope that guy's okay  I hope he's good 
[03:37:30]  and all of a sudden  you're talking more about  your breakup  and I thought I was listening  to my pal Anthony  because wow  oh my god  I guess it's similar  no matter  who  you know  who goes through a divorce  because  yeah I heard you  talking about the whole thing  you know  when finances are involved  and lawyers get involved  and stuff  it just gets so  I just  you know  long  and ugly  and just  there's no justice in it 
[03:38:00]  well that's it  well  and California  is a 50-50 state  and I don't really know  where we are with it  and I don't have that much bread  you know  I just don't  I'm not some sort of superstar  she knows what we went through  I know what we went through  she always felt like bad  that she didn't work more  bring more money in  and I never had a big problem with it  and now she made some bread  and she found her window  and there's part of me  that's sort of like  well walk away  you know  I mean  be big about this  you left me  walk away  just walk away  do the right thing  just walk away  well there's something to it  but you know 
[03:38:30]  she's entitled to it legally  so why would she not take it  on some level  but again  I don't have that much bread  and the root of this  really  and that was  I was telling Jim  is that  she needs  she got overwhelmed  by my personality  my negativity  my cynicism  like even if you're not yelling  or even if you're having a good day  you're still  you know  a little  you're kind of like  a negativity sprinkler  you just emanate it  like you're  a negativity humidifier  sitting there on the couch  and they walk into this environment  and she'd had enough of it  and okay  so I get that 
[03:39:00]  so she takes off  and she wants to be independent  I just don't understand  why do I have to finance that project  yeah  you know  given that she's got a few bucks  but I guess that's something  that all men go through with this  and you just got to accept it  and try not to hate all women  God bless you  for just sitting there saying  you just got to accept it  because we could take phone calls  for the next four hours  of guys that are having a problem accepting it  well I don't know what California law is  as far  is it 50-50  based on what you have at that moment  it's 50-50  of what you acquired during the marriage 
[03:39:30]  like if there's stuff before the marriage  then that's not on the table  and the only reason I'm saying  that I accept it on some level  don't think I don't have these  these waves  of anger and sadness  is that  first of all  I have no choice  but to accept it  because knowing me  if I let it eat me up  then I'm going to have a resentment  that's going to dig into my heart  and it's going to stay there  for God knows how long  and on the other side of that  I know I was an ass  I mean  I'm not in the dark  about  you know  how much of a douche I've been  I mean 
[03:40:00]  I'm not trying to deny that  I'm not a complete victim here  I did  I did have some part in this thing  but  but you know  when you have  that's the thing Jim  is that when you have the anger thing  when you're done being angry  there's that right after  you're like  okay we good  you know what I mean  you could sit there  and scream  and yell  and rage  and accidentally break a chair  it was an accident  I swear  and then right after you're done  if they're upset  and they're freaked out  you know  when you're a guy who rages  right after you're done  you're like I feel better  do you want to have something to eat  and they're like no  no I'm a mess 
[03:40:30]  forget the emotional  like kind of hangover  they're going to have  three days from now  exactly  or a day from now  because what we do  yeah  and you go through cycles like that  which is what I think  one of the big problems with her  is that she said  this happens over and over again  you say you're going to do something about it  you don't do something about it  and then we're back in this  and I'm like  well what do you mean  and then if you think about it  you're like  oh crap  you know  maybe she's right  you know  I realize that I'm only dating a girl  for a while  I'm not married  but I'm 75% of the problem  oh I am  I know it  she's not perfect  she's a boob  but I mean I am 75% 
[03:41:00]  that probably means you're 85% of the problem  by the way  I mean  I'm downplaying  it's got to be said  but when you're like us  so I mean  I have an inner Jim Norton  somewhere in there  that doesn't have the courage  to put myself through  whatever the hell it is that you do  but I  but  but the thing is  is that  if you have that insecurity  or if you  if you beat up on yourself  by nature  you're going to shoulder  the whole burden immediately  like when she left  I'm like  it's all me  I'm going to  I'm going to  I'm going to go hook myself up  to a box  that's going to fix me  you know  it's almost like 
[03:41:30]  you got cancer  it's like  could somebody lobotomize me  could you disconnect this thing  that ruined my life  can you help me out  and then as time goes on  you're like  wait a minute  she's sitting here  she's been here for eight years  it's got to be feeding something  you know  I wasn't holding her hostage  except for that once  but thank God  she didn't call the cops  because that could really hurt me in court  but I  but I  but it is a 50-50 thing  you know that  it's not 75%  it's got to go both ways  because why the hell is she sitting there  she's probably  she's probably working out  childhood demons through me  I mean I'm sure I remind her  of somebody awful 
[03:42:00]  and she's just trying to fix it  believe me  I'm her lamb  that she ran with  yeah  yeah  she's trying to  work something out  well that's what  well that's what happens  stop hearing the crying  I've never  that's what happened  heard it put that way before  I like that  well that's what happens  I find that the women  that I've  that I've attracted in my life  they're always  they're cute  they're sexy  they're charming  they're cutting  they're funny  and deep down  they resent every member  of our gender  that there's some part  and the problem with women  really  all women  I think  is that they all have fathers 
[03:42:30]  and at some point  you know  whatever their father  didn't do  whatever they didn't do  or whatever they did do  to whatever extreme it was  you know  men are going to pay for it  in their lives  and I'm just that guy  you know  I mean I'll look into  somebody's eyes  and I'll just see  you know this hurricane  and I'm like  I'm going in  you know  there are Barbie parts  flying around  camp counselors  you know  missed rides  you know what I mean  and I'm just sitting there  going  where's the broken daddy box  where's the broken daddy box 
[03:43:00]  I'll hook directly into it  and I'll just hold on  you know  that is  it's so true man  I  I have made  a career  in my relationships  over my whole life  going out with girls  that just  didn't have fathers  they left  right  for some reason  during their life  at some point  and just  and those are the girls  I've always  like somehow  connected  I had a couple  of those too man  I'm not even talking  a couple  I'm talking 
[03:43:30]  every single  one of them  it's a continuum  it's just  yeah there's just  not every single one  like when I was younger  of course  just basically  you know  high school stuff  of course  some of them  had fathers then  but I'm sure  they eventually  left the family  but then you have  that moment  where they do  that slip  and it'll always  happen  once or twice  in your relationship  they'll do the like  hey dad  I mean mark  oh  yeah  oh  yeah  awkward  what was really  awkward for me  is that my wife 
[03:44:00]  called me daddy  outside of the bedroom  and I knew  I knew that  that was going to be  an issue at some point  I was always  a little uncomfortable  with it  never in the bedroom  always outside  of the bedroom  hey mark  it's worse  if they call you  father  changing gears  slightly here  because you really  wanted to talk about  the Chinese are coming  or the Patriots Act  or surveillance  there was a bunch  of things you were  trying to get off  your chest here  well I need to learn  the Patriots Act  that's where you  can't film a team  from the sideline  there you go 
[03:44:30]  I need to learn  Chinese because  it's now the biggest  mark in the world  I know the future  is Chinese  there's a lot  of freaks out there  that think it's  going to be Mexican  I mean you watch  Lou Dobbs  you'd think he was  doing a show  from the Alamo  but  but it is Chinese  and I you know  I've become fascinated  with Chinese people  recently because  I really don't know  anything about them  I don't know anything  I mean I just don't  know anything  they've been here  longer than most  very mysterious  yeah they've been here  longer than most  ethnic groups  when was the last  time you sat down  with a Chinese guy  and just said  probably never  what is going on  I think they're  never  you know  and I go to Chinatown  I'm fascinated  with their food 
[03:45:00]  you ever go down  to Chinatown  and just spend an hour  walking down the street  going what the hell  is this  what is that  is that a rock  is that a bug  is that a root  what is that moss  I think it's a dried clam  what the hell is it  how do they use that  what is that going  are we eating that  I mean I wonder  how many times  Chinese grocers  have to see like  you know  white guys  holding things up  going dude  what is that  eat it  you're high  come on eat it  you think it's a  cleaning product  it's dessert  yeah exactly  it's that gelatinous  stuff  but this isn't about  food  it's about the future  and I think  what you're talking  about is  I've been saying  it forever  yeah if you look  at the papers  it's slowly but surely 
[03:45:30]  coming  yeah most of our  national debt  is to China  they own this  country on paper  the best I can figure  we are outsourced  Chinese labor  in this country  and our job  is I think  to eat and buy  things  and the other  thing is  I think that  the future  is Chinese  environmentally  because if you  read the reports  if global warming  continues  at its current  pace  all that's going  to be left  in the ocean  is prehistoric  toxic algae  and mutant jellyfish  and if you think  about it  the Chinese  are really the  only culture  that knows  how to prepare  that stuff  so I'm saying  get a new cookbook  learn a few key  free areas  just get ready 
[03:46:00]  for the new bosses  yeah they do  own this country  oh yeah  they're holding  on to more  of our money  more of our cash  we got no money  this is a complete  debt run economy  all we manufacture  here is need  that's all we  manufacture  yeah you flew  by that thought  it was pretty  interesting  that our job  in America  is to eat  and buy stuff  that's it  that's it  and they manufacture  they try to  exploit our desires  basically advertising  the industry  their job  is to desire farm  they're farming  our desires  to give us 
[03:46:30]  new ones  that we don't need  you got everything  you need  what do you need  you need toilet paper  some food  and maybe  what  what else  that's about  you don't even need  toilet paper  so all you need  is food  and a house  you don't need  all the other crap  so every  that's all  all they're doing  is  and that's why  I think  there's never  going to be  national health care  because really  the economy  needs the turnover  if poor people  if they can't afford  to be part of it  if they can't afford  to be part of it  we'll die  you're going to die  we don't need you  sorry  yeah yeah  what are you going to do  adapt or die 
[03:47:00]  that's like a lotto  sorry  it's Logan's run  should have kept up  it's all about consumers  and I have more thoughts on it  but I  the thing about  oh god  what the hell  just happened  to my train of thought  breathe  breathe  make a pink gum  go ahead  grab another piece  I was in Scotland  Scotland  okay  I'm in Scotland  well this is  what made me  what are we talking  about the Chinese  though  what happened  right  and we're going  to follow the thought  worldwide  we're going worldwide  I'm in Scotland  worst month of my life  I go to the Fringe Festival 
[03:47:30]  and I'm performing  for people  that don't like Americans  I didn't realize  that there were 900 shows  going on every night  so I'm drawing audiences  of 12  so I go to Scotland  to perform for 12 people  for 28 days  and I gotta be honest with you  I'm critical of this country  but I've never been  more patriotic in my life  because I resented  these provincial  alcoholic dummies  I mean  no one has given them  the memo that  one alcoholism  is a disease  not a way of life  and two that  hey maybe you shouldn't  have a piece of pig  and butter  with every meal  with every meal  you gotta have pig  and butter 
[03:48:00]  I mean  a full English breakfast  in this country  is an attempted suicide  now  so  and if I heard  one more time  in the UK  they're like  Americans don't understand  irony  and I'm like  what are you talking about  I'm an intelligent person  I live in the United States  my entire existence  is ironic  now  but getting back  to the food thing  this is where it's coming around  is they eat this crap  I mean the things they eat  you know  in this country  would frighten people  would frighten people  and there's not a lot  of obese people in Scotland  and I'm thinking  how the hell is this possible  how does that work  well I realize  that apparently  in other countries 
[03:48:30]  in between meals  they stop eating  which is just unheard of here  you know  I mean that's part of our freedom  you gotta spare a moment  shove something in your mouth  they're gonna change  the slogan of the United States  from America  land of the free  home of the brave  to America  all you can eat  step up to the buffet  quick get some food  between you and your feelings  before they lead to questions  god damn  that is so  friggin right on the mark  it is the eating  in between eating  oh yeah  when I leave my house  it looks like I'm going 
[03:49:00]  on a camping trip  and I'm just going  across town  if I'm at the hotel  and I gotta get on the subway  I'm like  I need an apple  some water  maybe a backpack  a tent  where's my tent  you just really don't see  the amount of fat people  anywhere else  than you do here  and the news  I love when they do the report  we talk about it all the time  when they have to take  the b-roll  from the neck down  of fat people  when they're doing  the fat story  and we always imagine  the person at home  knowing that he wore  those clothes out  and was walking  through Central Park  and it's like  oh my god 
[03:49:30]  I'm the fat guy  for the fat story  fatty number seven  in the montage  fatty number seven  I think it's sad  on some level  but I have the  I've often thought  about how  that the government  should get involved  and I know that  a lot of people  don't think the government  should be involved  in our lives  but I really think  that they should  the Food and Drug Administration  should create  a special task force  of fat marshals  you know they have  air marshals  on the planes  supposedly  if there's a terrorist  they're going to snap  into action  and take care of it  but I just think  that they should have  fat marshals  that are out  at McDonald's  at Fridays  and some of the  chain restaurants 
[03:50:00]  if they see a guy  over 250 pounds  about to dig into a sundae  they just get up  and go  put the spoon down  I'm a United States  fat marshals  put the spoon down  step away from the ice cream  but I really  wasn't going to eat  much of it  get away  drop it  drop it  drop the spoon  how do you think  how do you think  the country  this country  will just end  every empire  has its day  and then just ends  how do you see  the United States  because I'm amazed  we can be  so much in debt  have such horribly  out of shape 
[03:50:30]  people running around  and still be  the superpower  on the planet  where does this end  I've heard one idea  the thing I've always thought  and it's the best thing  that could ever happen  is for some reason  on the same day  everybody on the planet  wakes up and can't breathe properly  and they finally go like  oh my god  maybe there's a problem  if this is a common experience  perhaps  maybe capitalism  at this extreme  wasn't that great idea  but I think  the one thing I read  that I thought was funny 
[03:51:00]  is that America  just ends with a traffic jam  you think it's just a big  no one can get anywhere  exactly  oh that's it  there's people outside  their cars  everyone look at each other  like what the hell's going on  up there  it finally happened  just complete gridlock  of the entire country  no one can get to work  like a clogged artery  and our empire crumbles  the end  that's pretty good man  Mark Maron  we gotta end this side  of the show  unfortunately  it's the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony 
[03:51:30]  welcome back  to the Opie and Anthony  radio program  it's the best  the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the Opie and Anthony show  hey it's Louis CK  and this is the worst  of Robert Kelly  on the Opie and Anthony show  uh Robert Kelly  fat  just like all  everybody else  on this show  if you were  if you were in the room  when Robert Kelly  was being born  you'd see a cunt  coming out of  some cunt's cunt  hey Bob

[04:01:00]  times  and he had  no idea  he's like  that's good  good for you  that's great  that sounds fun  can we get that  we're gonna have it  in a few minutes  hey Bob  you also were on  CNN recently  yeah  you're blowing up  buddy  why were you on  CNN  I was on  Spike TV  too last night  like I said  you were on  CNN recently  you know  I'll tell you  Spike TV  that son of a  bitch  are you family  with that guy  who  what's his name  Sharippa 
[04:01:30]  Steve Sharippa  yeah  no he blew us off  let me tell you  something  I'm gonna tell you  something this guy  this guy  I go on  right  I'm on the show  he literally tells  right off the bat  he hates comedians  right  that's good  I'm like  oh that's good  I go  yeah  because he books  he used to book  the club  the Riviera  yeah  I go  oh you club owners  you guys are really  happy together though  no you guys don't have  any problems at all  and uh  and then he  actually  whatever  we're fucking  busting balls  and uh  he keeps saying  some gay shit

[04:02:30]  and then a comedian  comes with real wit  they don't have  anything really to say  and that's probably  why he was  uncomfortable with it  because you were  being funnier than him  you're lucky  he didn't throw  a garbage douche  I'll make you  look like a  bio  man  will ya  yeah  and they just  kept talking  they just kept  talking  like they're supposed  to ask me shit  but they just kept  yapping  and they just  kept reading  like they just  wanted to get  we're on XM  right  wait wait  hold on  this is all  on the air  with Sharipa  dude this is all

[04:03:30]  so  wanted to see  if she had  a cast on  you know  a what  nothing  it's a callback  go ahead  so yeah  dude it was  it was  it was atrocious  yeah  I mean who  tells a comic  not to be funny  yeah don't be funny  what do you want  to talk about  the news  you get the USA  today you fat  bastard  right  oh wait  this is all  on Spike TV  this is all  on Spike TV  I'm sorry Bob  I was confused  I think you saw  him today  no no  it was on his  show  and I was actually  really looking forward  to it  because he  you know I thought  he's comics 
[04:04:00]  he knows comics  he says I hate comics  oh thanks  cool  well he probably dealt  with a lot of douchebags  but  I know but you don't  tell me that  you son of a bitch  alright Bob  so you were on CNN  commenting on Britney Spears  we got the audio  oh god  what  oh god  you didn't like it  it was  they cut out a lot  of stuff  I actually  the line they  they cut out  I did a nice  rich Voss plug  into it  and they cut out  a line about  Michael Jackson  so they kind of  edited it like VH1  to make it more tame  so 
[04:04:30]  what was the  Michael Jackson line  I said something  about you know  Britney Spears  got the past  torched  from Madonna  she made out  with Britney  and that was kind of  passing the torch  to Britney  and you know  a lot of people  do that  I said something  about Michael Jackson  passes the torch  but you know  he does it to little kids  in a different way  alright well  let's listen to the audio  of course it's the  Britney Spears stuff  another thing  that is on YouTube  that everyone's  checking out  I heard talking  with Kevin  they look like 
[04:05:00]  they're fucked up  either smoking pot  or drunk or something  and then they have  all these pot thoughts  and they talked  about time travel  yeah she's called  the time speed  space travel  time speed  space travel  what a dope  so here's Bob Kelly  on CNN commenting  and while some are  taking this latest  Britney sighting  in stride  it really is not  going to hurt  her image at all  her fans know  that Britney Spears  is just a pretty  down to earth  simple low key girl  and this is exactly  what she's doing  in the video  she's hanging out  having some snacks 
[04:05:30]  having fun  this really isn't  going to hurt  her career at all  others got a look  at Britney's  whacked out theories  on time travel  have you ever seen  Back to the Future  is that possible  to time travel  speed  yes it is  and they're  taking their shots  at her  you know she just  went out and bought  a DeLorean too  she's put  she put a  she put a Jack LaLanne  juicer on the back  of it  she's sticking cabbage  in it right now  it don't work  honey it don't work  dude  dude you gotta put  lettuce in 
[04:06:00]  I've seen them  use lettuce dude  you sure  yeah  wow  hello  wow  hello  do you know  right now  I don't blame  anybody who  have slapped  your face  in the last  five years  right now  John Ramsey  is having  bigger laughs  at the news  he just got  wow  they really  cut that up  yeah  they must have  they did  all the good stuff  they did a  humectomy  what do you want 
[04:06:30]  to do  Lucky Louie  on CNN  in the afternoon  attaboy  good plug  I'll take it  I actually did  a great plug  and they cut it  because they  pissed me off  I did look  we're talking  about Britney  today  we're not  talking about  the Stones  alright here's  has it hurt  her reputation  Bob Kelly  on CNN  Showbiz Tonight  is wondering  after months  of tabloid  coverage of her  marriage to  Kevin Federline  her missteps  with her baby  and now  this clip  are people  now laughing  with Britney 
[04:07:00]  or at her  how about  music videos  can we try  that again  maybe we get  back to the  old singing  routine  back when  Britney was  doing the  old singing  routine  beginning with  hit me baby  one more time  Britney quickly  became an  iconic superstar  she sold  more than  76 million  records worldwide  I lived  for Britney Spears  she did it  all  from commercials  to perfume  and even  kissing Madonna  she made  out with  Madonna  you know  you have 
[04:07:30]  to be big  to make  out with  Madonna  alright  not only  do you have  to be a  woman  but you have  to be big  she was the  biggest thing  for a minute  I mean she was it  she was the next  Madonna for a second  and then you know  um  wait a minute  I want to put out  an open call  to any comedians  we have a vacancy  on the O&A  traveling virus  tour show  listen jackass  they called me  at 10 that  morning  where were you  at awake  what do you  want to do  that was a  pretty good  line 
[04:08:00]  dude  that was a  pretty good  line  dude  where were you  Britney dude  she made out  with Madonna  you gotta be  big to make  out with Madonna  I mean not only  do you gotta be  a woman  but you gotta be  big  that was a  pretty good  line  but that's  the line  they cut it  up dude  they had the  other line  the Michael  Jackson line  but they  wouldn't use  that  and then the  plug was in  that  it was pretty  funny  what are they  trying to do  like a VH1  thing on CNN  well yeah  dude I had no 
[04:08:30]  idea  they called me  up you want to  do CNN  of course I do  would you think  they wanted you  to talk about  the war  yeah  the fuck  well I thought  yeah I mean  you know  Hezbollah  and Lebanon  I mean  and Israel  there's certain  things going on  that I know  about that maybe  could help the  situation  they got a  juicer on the  back of their  tanks  I'm telling her  put in lettuce  she bought a  Lamborghini  it's got a  juicer on it  and then you  realize it wasn't  going the way  you want so you  started naming  things she put  in there  dude you got  hot peppers  you got red  peppers you got  green peppers 
[04:09:00]  you got lettuce  they put a  whole bunch of  celery  oh please be a  funny vegetable  coming up  put in Karen  and Quinlan  well maybe you  should have  maybe you  should have  slapped the  reporter in  the face  put my  cock all  over your  Darth Vader  cheeks  alright Bob  we have one  more clip  from CNN  by the way  at the  connection  Bob will  be doing  the complete  version  of the  Lamborghini 
[04:09:30]  juicer bit  and driving  mishaps with  her son  Sean Preston  made her a  bit of a  tabloid joke  anything with  a baby  you know  it ruined  Michael Jackson  and it ruined  Britney  okay you  can't have  kids  and if you  do have  kids  adopt them  like Brad  and Angelina  but some say  don't count  Britney out  you can keep  an eye on her  she's really  going to come  into her own  next few years  she's gone back 
[04:10:00]  into the studio  right now  she's recording  another album  so she certainly  has plans  after her next  child to get  back on the road  keep touring  put another album  out so I think  we're just going  to have to wait  and see what  you know  this next album  produces  to see what  kind of star  she's going to  become  and no matter  what you have  to say about  her video on  YouTube  we're still  talking about  it  whenever a person  did that  took that little  video dumb clip  it worked  because we're  talking about her  we're not  talking about  anybody else  today  we're not  talking about  U2  we're not  talking about  The Stones  you did it 
[04:10:30]  good for you  what  you go girl  cut the good  stuff  I'm with Bob  I said  they're not  talking about  U2  they're not  talking about  Bob Kelly  at the Comedy  Connection  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  it was a  great plug  and the guy  the guy  was laughing  his ass off  I said  some stuff  about a vagina  that's good  for CNN  it's CNN  Bob  but I said  it with a B  I made it  cute  what was the  other line  before this  what was the  line right  before this  oh yeah  because that

[04:18:30]  it was the  day of  i think  the day  of  john carr's  name popped  up every  three seconds  on every  newscast  you bring  him up  as a  comic  you're  working  with  he was  on the  tv  in front  of us  and talk  about how  fantastic  he is  and you're  saying  look  john carr's  gonna stop  by and kill  six  that's gonna  be great  he's gonna  kill it  i know him  um  has anybody  noticed that  john carr looks  exactly like  doug stanhope  anybody freaked  out by that  at all  and it does  it really  does dude 
[04:19:00]  he really  does  i'm wondering  if doug  had a one  nighter in  boulder that  night  you know  i'm looking  into it  they think  it was actually  him because  they found  a garret  and a man  show dvd  girls gone  wild  young girls  gone  wild  your love  and life  i mean  this has  gotta be  bigger than  you thought  it would be  i mean  you always  hoped that  it would  be big  but  you're  actually  bigger than  i thought  you'd be  well i didn't  play hockey  i thought  you were  smaller  you're thin  you look  gone  i get that

[04:25:00]  well guess who's back  it's the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the opium anthony show  and we're back  with the opium anthony program  that was a quick break  huh  broadcasting live  broadcasting live  from washington dc  in studio  al franken everyone 
[04:25:30]  sorry to make you wait  we had some  no no  we had some broads  in here  we had some dames  in here  they call their show  broad minded  so we had a couple  of the broads  a little play on words  because they're women  i got it  broad  yeah  so mr franken  how are you  i'm great  very good  you're uh  quite the uh  best-selling author  these days  i'm quite the best-selling  author  yes  people buying your books  up like crazy  uh  i think half the people  that buy them  love your point of view 
[04:26:00]  and half hate it  i think it's more  two-thirds  a third  but it'd be nice  if uh  half the people  uh  thank  well it'd be  actually i get some people  uh buying it  who haven't decided yet  and that's nice  or who uh  actually are curious  actually want to  find out something  i like reading things  that get me angry  a lot of times  you read and just go  mother  this  no  well there's a lot of that 
[04:26:30]  in this book  is there  yeah  a lot of people are starting to say  that you're biased to the left  just a little  who are these people  little left  and where are they  i want to talk to them  but it's a little left-leaning  i love  well it depends  where you  where you are  but i mean i've read  i've read uh  uh  some of o'reilly's  uh books  yeah that'll make you mad  and  and then michael moore's books  right  and i'm equally as pissed  reading either one  uh-huh  because uh  it's so far  one side or the other 
[04:27:00]  that it cannot possibly  be based in fact  or truth  it is just ridiculous  you know  uh  mine are  are  maybe  different than  anyone else's  in that  uh  i have a  particular thing  about lies  and the truth  so  i do a tremendous  amount of research  and also people  on my shows  or research in my book  do it  so  and at least there's some humor 
[04:27:30]  thrown in  yes  so that would be  that would  those two things  would distinguish it  certainly from o'reilly  yeah  yeah  where there is just  a complete lack of humor  at least  his private life  is hysterical  as all hell  that  uh  yeah  little problem  he had with the phone  phone calls  yeah he did a good job  making that go away  his ratings are just as strong  yeah  unbelievable  yeah he paid her off  so  yeah  but didn't do anything  uh  didn't do anything  i'm just gonna pay you  he actually never denied it 
[04:28:00]  yeah  he never denied it  but he never came forward  and said that he did it  no  but uh  all he had to do  was make a settlement  pay a lot of money  and part of the settlement  is that you never talk  can't talk about it  that sure sounds like  you did it  yes  yes  i would say  and she had  she had what seemed like  a transcript  yeah  of a thing  which um  you know  leads me to believe  there is a tape  somewhere  which yes  which leads me to believe  that's why he settled  which  but anyway  that's you know 
[04:28:30]  what's interesting about him  is that he talks a lot  on his show  about  morals  morals  and he talks about  traditional values  and his traditional values  as opposed to  uh  we were part of that  secular  leftist  yeah  uh  human  you know  and  and  and he keeps talking about  his traditional values  and i don't know what  phone  what is traditional  about phone sex  i didn't think the phone  had been around long enough  to be a  you know  maybe telegraph sex  is a traditional value 
[04:29:00]  but this is a guy  you know  a married man  uh  calling  a female employee  who doesn't want  to be called  and making  very very  filthy  calls to her  yeah  that's not a traditional value  where i  you know  it's a lot harder  my tradition  it's a lot harder  for the right  to preach  their agenda  because  they can come off  looking hypocritical  very easily  by the life  they lead  their personal life  and stuff  it seems to me  if you're more left leaning 
[04:29:30]  no matter what you do  you go  hey  it's part of the lifestyle  man  well no  i mean  you can fuck  and suck  and this  it doesn't matter  is this  on  xm  yes  i just figured  that out  yeah  no here's the thing  i think it's  you can be hypocritical  wherever you are  if you  you can be hypocritical  if you  you know  if you preach  being an environmentalist 
[04:30:00]  and  you know  invest in  litter  if you throw a can  out the window  i mean more of  more of a moral lifestyle  thing  i think  yeah but i mean  there's plenty of room  for hypocrisy  all over the place  yeah hypocrisy  sure  even you know  liberals of course  can come off  looking very hypocritical  yeah  so i wouldn't  i wouldn't say that  that uh  they they have  a lock on hypocrisy  that the right does  but  there is 
[04:30:30]  i mean obviously  look at there's  there's limbaugh  who for years  would when any  uh drug addict  would die  would say  just another dead doper  good riddance  to you sir  yeah  and uh  anyone who  uses drugs illegally  should be put away  should be thrown in prison  and now you know  so  and and  and uh  uh bill bennett  likes to say like  uh i never  uh you know  wrote against gambling 
[04:31:00]  uh  therefore i'm not a hypocrite  and i said well  of course you didn't  because you knew  you were a gambler  i know  why are you gonna put  yourself in that trap  but uh  you know  you were  you gambled away  eight million dollars  there's something wrong  with that  it's a bit of a problem  yeah  it's a problem  and and  by the way  you're uh  empower america  whatever your group said  that that  did label uh  gambling as a  as one of the things  that hurt society  and and so you're 
[04:31:30]  a hypocrite  sir  yeah  you know  but anyway  so  what uh  none of us are perfect  right guys  huh  right  right  and we all agree  is that a bipartisan  agreement  there we are  there we are  let's not point  you know when you're  pointing a finger  at someone else  there's three fingers  pointing back at you  pointing back at you  that's right  absolutely  that's what i always say  who do you want to see  as president next  time around  you for or against bush  uh  i um  how happy are you 
[04:32:00]  that he's not looking  good at all these days  you know i have to say  that i don't take  joy in  our president  doing badly  but it's great  um  no he's just  uh so many things  are coming home to roost  and it is sad  it is sad  that it has to happen  because of uh  people suffering  in katrina  i mean that  this sort of opened  everyone's eyes  to how much cronyism  there is  and how  you know  after four years  after 9-11  how we didn't  get anything together 
[04:32:30]  um  and and  and what's  and in iraq  now there's a thing  in the new york times  today saying  he's going to  the new york times  what's that  uh  it's it's actual paper  that you have on your  on here  we read the new york post  see the difference  in our  see the difference  between you  and us  we don't read any articles  without a picture  not enough pictures  in that one  uh  no picture on this one  it's just too big  it's just too big  it said he's scheduled  to give a speech  in annapolis  maryland on wednesday 
[04:33:00]  assessing progress  both in iraq  and what he calls  the broader war  on terrorism  and several officials  said he's expected  to contend  that the  uh  iraqi forces  have made great progress  now this is on the heels  of a piece  in the atlantic monthly  by james fallows  who we're having  on our show today  which says that  there's been  no progress  or essentially  no progress  and you just can't  trust this guy  and i think that's  what people  are are getting  is that  so if he goes out  and says  we've made a lot 
[04:33:30]  of progress  in in building  this iraqi army  and we're going  to be able to  leave just in time  for the 06 election  you know midterms  yeah  i don't trust him  you know  and we're not  going to cut and run  we're going to turn  and tiptoe out  yeah  pull the old vietnam  yeah  and and it really  worries me  it it uh  i'm going over there  actually next month  i'm going  i do uso tours  speaking of which  my wife asked me  she doesn't like me going  she says  you don't see o'reilly 
[04:34:00]  going over to iraq  do uso tours  and i say honey  that's not fair  he has no talent  that's what i say to her  that would dishearten  the troops  to bring morale down  yeah  if they were too happy  and chipper over there  then you send o'reilly  he's just a pompous ass  do you do the radio show  there or do you just  stand up  or both  uh i just do stand up  i do actually phone in  from uh  uh  but but you don't know  what your schedule's 
[04:34:30]  going to be  you can't do a scheduled  radio  jimmy did uh  he went over there  yeah  performed a few times  we did like a week  there  yeah  where'd you go  uh  we were in uh  baghdad  kirkuk talil  balad we couldn't land  because the fog was  too thick  so we spent two days  in baghdad  just a week  balad's anaconda  that base  i don't know  we went down  it was like 100 feet  they couldn't see  the other way  we went back up  had to fly  you know  we hit the history  with ricardo sanchez  you know  oh well that's  then you're safe  yeah 
[04:35:00]  bunch of double force people  real men and me  real men and you  who are the other  comics with you  uh colin and uh  laurie kilmartin  who's a writer  great  isn't it amazing  doing it  yeah i mean  the gigs are fantastic  the soldiers are happy  that you're there  they're really happy  you're there  they're really grateful  that you show up  yeah and you feel safe  i mean you're surrounded  by the u.s military  right  you feel uh  we didn't go though  we flew only uh  uh c-130s  we didn't have any blackhawks  i did blackhawks  which made me nervous  yeah it's scary  yeah i did um 
[04:35:30]  it's funny  i after the first time  went in 2003  and then i also went  last year  uh but after i came back  uh i went around  christmas time  and uh in the spring  i was out in la  the friday before uh  oscars  and uh ariana  huffington invited me  to this big hollywood  party  and at this agent's  house and there's  all these a-list people  there uh mel gibson  and tom hanks 
[04:36:00]  actually some people  i knew from doing  saturday night live  but they had been  hosts but at one  point i got like  literally overwhelmed  by all this  and i went to sit  in a room by myself  it was a library  at this agent's house  and i sat down  and i heard  hey uh  and it was  sylvester salone  and i never met him  before so i said  hey  sylvester  and he said  hey i heard you  went on one of them  u.s.o tours  and i said  yeah i did  he said yeah  i was supposed to  but i didn't  and i said 
[04:36:30]  well why didn't you  and he said  i thought it might  be dangerous  and i said to him  well it's not really  because you're with  the uso  and they don't want  anyone in the uso  to get hurt  and you're traveling  you're really embedded  well let me ask you  this was any time  at any point  that you felt  that you might  be in danger  and i said  yeah i guess  the only times  were when  we took black hawks  from baghdad  to crit  and there had been  some black hawks  shot down  so i guess  then i felt like 
[04:37:00]  maybe i had a  one in ten thousand  chance of something  you know  he goes  yeah that's why  i didn't go  and i said  weren't you  like fucking rambo  in the movies  and he went  well yeah  but i got a good life  you know  i don't wanna  you know  i like my life  but essentially  yeah you're very safe  and my wife  goes nuts  for the three days  that i'm  in iraq  because we also  go to  we're also in  kuwait  and in afghanistan  and i can't 
[04:37:30]  and we're  taking great care  of and i can  imagine  what the family  members of  guys that are  over there  for a year  year and a half  yeah sure  not just a few days  so they must  and my wife  was saying that  too the other day  just yesterday  because you know  she said god  i can't imagine  what it would be  like to be a family  member or somebody  over there  i think it's worse  for the family  members and for  the troops  in some ways  i actually felt  safer in iraq  than i did in kuwait  we were in kuwait  for one night 
[04:38:00]  or a night and a half  because iraq is a war zone  everybody knows  what's going on  but in kuwait  you're in a hotel  which is deemed safe  but it's like  you're in like  a middle eastern city  i just didn't feel  comfortable in kuwait  at all  oh you're in a hotel  there huh  yeah yeah  see they put us  on a base  oh we didn't stay there  no we stayed in a hotel  we're all bases  was there a starbucks  there jimmy  there actually was  absolutely there was  in a hotel  that didn't make you  feel safe  that made me feel  there's a starbucks  i may be beheaded  but at least a latte  will go down first  yeah it was kind of  horrifying 
[04:38:30]  so who do you want to  see as our next  president  did you answer that  i didn't  oprah winfrey  no  some say it should be  the next president  what do you think  of joe biden  i like joe biden  i'd be more of a  hillary person  i'd be also  see you're throwing  you're throwing away  your vote  you're throwing it away  it's a gimmick  ticket  what  hillary  she's not a ticket  she's a person  it would be  no it would be  a gimmick ticket  why is it a gimmick  ticket  she's an incredibly 
[04:39:00]  able person  and and  does america  ready to  elect a woman  yeah that's the  question  elect a woman  who they think  is  that's the question  i think there's a lot  of forget about  women i think  there's a lot of  people that don't  think she's very  credible as  as an elected  official never mind  president  why though  why  you know  why  there you go  i think  she's become this  picture of feminism  and to be honest with you  what bothers me about her  is she did  what any other woman did  what she did  which is stay with a guy  who was sleeping with 
[04:39:30]  everybody under her nose  and embarrassing her  and she stayed with him  and there's something  about that  that really bothers me  it's like  if any other woman did it  they would be attacking her  as this 1950s  housewife  weak  yeah  yeah but because she does it  they're like wow  look at her  she's staying with her  i don't i don't know  first of all i think  you might read that  differently i think that  actually helped her  in a way  is that she stood  by her man  in an odd way  and and  uh that's not  the sum of  what she is  i think that's a  in fact she may have 
[04:40:00]  the strong  you know  if she runs  and uh  in 2008  and people say  well i have a  i have a real problem  with bill  clinton's personal life  she has the argument  of like  you think you have  a problem with it  how about me  and they go  oh yeah  yeah yeah  okay  and i think she's  incredibly brilliant  now i mean  there are other people  that i really like too  i like  barack obama  it's probably too soon  for him to run  but i just think  he's uh  going to be president  someday 
[04:40:30]  see here is why  the democrats  screw up  year after year  uh with  with the election  four year after four year  you guys  gotta get  a legitimate  candidate in there  not some  obama  ain't gonna happen  i just said that  hillary  yeah i know  but even to bring it up  and hillary  just knock it off  find a credible  no hillary beats  any republican  except mccain  i don't think so  no way  i don't think so  i think for a woman 
[04:41:00]  name a republican  who beats her  mccain  no name a different  republic  i mean name a republican  besides mccain  who beats her  um  strom thurmond  name a republican  who's alive  that beats her  friggin cheney  would beat her  oh my lord  no  that's how bad  that's how bad it is  i think you don't  i don't think you know  i don't think you  i think you read  you read your new york post  the problem  i'll read my new york  the problem with a woman  being elected  she'll have to be a conservative  i think 
[04:41:30]  because you're gonna get  i think to get a crossover  you're gonna have more liberal  people and  thinking the power of a woman  being president  is gonna be important  and crushing over  then you will have  conservatives going to vote for  you understand what i mean  i think for a minority  or a woman to win  they're gonna have to be  republican  eventually  i understand that  and you put it so well too  yes  i understand that sentiment  but i think she's a  i think she is very very well regarded  certainly in the democratic party  and stands a good chance of getting the nomination 
[04:42:00]  and if she does  i don't see a republican  you've just named  giuliani  giuliani's not gonna get the nomination  well you're saying republican  i think he could beat her  but he's not gonna get the nomination  well how do we know  you're right how do we know  but he he lived with two gay guys  so what he's a good egg  i know but crossover helps out with the uh  no no no no  but what i'm saying is  is that he's not gonna get the nomination  yeah  you know  they're not gonna  they're not gonna go with the guy  i still think giuliani can beat her though 
[04:42:30]  i think credibility wise  giuliani is seen as this rock  this ex-prosecutor  and the way he handled new york after 9-11  and what he did for new york  and i think that his  inaction in public service  not that she's not sincere  which i don't think she is  but people would argue that  but i do think  you don't think she's sincere  nah i i personally never  never never dug her  i just don't  i haven't seen her do anything  i don't man  i don't  i have  she's done nothing  that's how people vote though  but she's never said anything  welcome here to  you know i like  who's a devil  issues in focus  i think  jimmy carter's a sincere guy 
[04:43:00]  never dug her  it's nothing against her  but i think her  her career motivation  is  oh you mean she's ambitious  well  ambitious  but it's more  it's it's it's more for herself  than it is public service  i think  that's just  how she comes off  it sounds corny  but that putting that yankee hat on  it's almost like  you're not a yankee  there's something about  giuliani being a new yorker  and a yankee fan  people feel like  or at least this is the person  who we're seeing  well here here's  if you talk to like  firefighters in new york 
[04:43:30]  and by the way  i thought he did  it was masterful  after 9-11  but  and i went to a number of  of services  funerals for  firefighters  because  because  giuliani asked people to  because you know  when a firefighter dies  normally  all these firefighters  from all over show up  but we had  several hundred die  and so they had one funeral  after another  so giuliani asked the public  to show up  so  my wife and i would go  just went  just as  just to go 
[04:44:00]  and i  and i saw him  at a number of them  and he was great  but  if you talk to  firefighters now  they don't like him  too much  and one of the reasons  they don't like him  is  and  and  is that he did  nothing to get  interoperability  between radio signals  between the police  and the fire department  done  between the first attack  on the world trade center  and the second attack  and that cost a lot  of lives  and i don't  i think if you really  examine his record 
[04:44:30]  before 9-11  it ain't so strong  i  again  i think he did  a masterful job  afterwards  i  you don't think  he cleaned up  new york before 9-11  as far as the way  the shape it was in  like with with  you know just with crime  and the little  quality of life stuff  that people called  him a nazi for  i think those  some of those were good  i also think some of them  were started during dinkins  i think that  community  policing was started  during dinkins  it was started  during dinkins  it gave  giuliani a lot of stuff  to clean up  make new york 
[04:45:00]  look better  well uh  dinkins was  oof  cops didn't like  i remember driving  into the city  uh when dinkins  was mayor  and uh  nothing but uh  uh squeegee guys  uh porno shops  which you know  fine i frequented  uh quite a few  but you know  they wouldn't exist  without people like you  absolutely  but as far as uh  you know  bringing money  into the city  and and building  well you know  you have to also 
[04:45:30]  remember that  that uh  i mean bloomberg  has improved over that  if you  yeah  and and  but also that  uh  you know  giuliani was mayor  during the clinton  administration  and things really  uh  during the clinton  administration  went very very well  for the united  for america  and for new york  because of the  the markets  and stuff  so a lot of that  was really about  uh economic forces  that had nothing  to do with giuliani  well look at all 
[04:46:00]  the Koch years  before that  when you look at  Koch and dinkins  it's just kind of  like the mess  that it turned into  well we had  Democrats running it  well no  we had  we had  uh  the crack  epidemic  and uh  you know  and and again  community policing  did start during  dinkins  which he doesn't  get any credit  for at all  but that was  toward the end  of his  um  his term  i think giuliani  was a really  great mayor  and a lot of  people will bring  up something  like uh  the brooklyn art  museum  which he was  wrong to  to try to  center the art 
[04:46:30]  and they'll say  well that's who  he was  but i think  he did a lot  of great  things for the  city  he's a republican  i think that  on credibility  would be  well i just  don't think  he's gonna  get the  nomination  because  of who  the republican  who votes  in republican  primaries  and that's  why i think  i think  i think  that mccain  won't  but i'm beginning  to think  that the more  desperate they get  they may turn  to him  yeah they kind  of need  somebody  they might  need  but looking  at the field  i don't see  someone from  the normal  ranks of who  they would  nominate  that would 
[04:47:00]  beat hillary  i don't see  george allen  or bill frist  or one of those  guys  well they can't  pick anybody  that's really  been kind of  buddied with  uh  the president  involved in  any of this  uh  shenanigans  with the war  if i may call  them shenanigans  yeah shenanigans  has a kind  of light  field  yeah  light  hearted  type of  oh the shenanigans  oh yes  oh the shenanigans  going on  in in bagdad  were you buying 
[04:47:30]  were you buying  and were you buying  any of the um  uh intelligence  when it first broke  yeah  you were buying  that too  i didn't think  that uh  presidents lied  to you  yeah i i was  i was buying  all that  yeah  because anthony  was i was buying  that  like i  i can't  stand bush  now and i  was a big  supporter  um first  election  i believe  colin powell  uh yeah  and colin powell  had such  credibility  with the people  most credible  man in the world  yeah i thought  i thought 
[04:48:00]  and he came out  when he came out  in front of the u.n  and showed those  pictures and gave  the speech it was  like wow okay  you know  we gotta do  something  and then  afterwards  it's like  they found  nothing  and kept  finding nothing  and then the  whole re  that's when  i just  changed  over  when  the entire  reason  for the war  changed  fuck the  weapons  it's not about  that anymore  it's about  these people  need to be  free  well  that isn't  kind of what 
[04:48:30]  you told us  in the first  place  because if it  was about  freeing these  people  i wouldn't  really be  going rah  rah  and backing  this because  it seems to  me they  really  don't crave  this freedom  they don't  understand it  and saddam  seemed to  rule with  that iron  fist that  kept terrorists  out of his  country  and now  it's a  clusterfuck  as they  call it  any ideas  because a lot  of people  say we  gotta stop  the war  somehow  even the  democrats  are saying  we can't  cut and 
[04:49:00]  run  right  do you  have any  no one  has real  solution  to the  problem  do you  have any  ideas of  how you  get the  guys out  but keep  it from  just  anarchy  after we're  gone  well we're  close to  anarchy  now  i mean  we're  closer to  anarchy  i mean  there's  another  story  yesterday  in this  thing  called  the  new york  times  yeah  about  moctadar  al-sadr  who is  this  radical  shiite  cleric  didn't he  start the  whole thing  wasn't he  the one  who was  the original  problem  he was 
[04:49:30]  one of  the original  problems  he was  the  he was  the original  problem  in the  south  and  in the  shia  side  he wasn't  the sunni  side  which is  that was  fallucia  that was  that was  also the  start of  the problems  and  but  sotter  yeah  his  his army  his militia  killed a lot  of americans  and now  he's going to  be on the  ballot  he's going  to be  have 30  guys on  the ballot 
[04:50:00]  as many  as the  dawa  party  as many  as the  skierty  party  he's going  to have  as many  guys  on the  ballot  as possible  and they  just killed  like about  30  like 30  sunnis  the other  day  just in  like a  massacre  yeah  I mean  it's  it is  friggin  crazy  over there  now  I'm having  James Fallows  on today  who's written  a piece  for the  Atlantic  on  getting the 
[04:50:30]  Iraqi military  up  because that's  the whole  thing  is like  we'll  we'll  when they  can take  over  we'll  leave  then that's  what we  keep saying  but we're  not serious  about that  we have not  been serious  about training  this army  and part of  it was  is that  we failed  to recognize  for a long  time  refused to  that we  were facing  an insurgency  in what we  were facing  and so  we wasted  the first year  and we  don't really  put enough  resources  and guys 
[04:51:00]  into training  and we  don't have  enough guys  over there  we don't  have enough  guys to  both train  them  and to  keep things  at bay  essentially  some gentleman  on Meet  the Press  yesterday  see there  you go  you watch  Meet the Press  he says  training  the Iraqi  army seems  to be the  selling point  of the  administration  right now  we got to  get them  trained  once they're  up to  speed  we can  leave  then he  brought up  a great  point  that  no matter  how well  trained  they are  they have  to believe  in what 
[04:51:30]  they're  fighting  for  once we  leave  and he  doesn't  really see  that happening  you can  give them  the guns  you can  teach them  how to  use it  but unless  they really  believe in  this cause  for freedom  and are  united  once we  leave  they're just  better armed  insurgents  and fractured  pieces of  governments  and back  to their  tribes  and then  now you're  screwed again  even though  you trained  this army  they just 
[04:52:00]  don't  believe  in what  they're  fighting  for  and I  seriously  don't  think  they  do  I don't  think  they  understand  what freedom  is enough  to really  have that  passion  to fight  for it  I think  many of them  do  and I think  when we first  got in there  there were a lot  of people  who were just  elated  the Kurds  well the Kurds  certainly do  for the people  yeah everyone  that was being  shit on  loved it  well that's  true  I mean the  she is  but a lot  of that  includes  people who  it was like 
[04:52:30]  a majority  of Iraqis  and we  blew it  we blew it  by allowing  looting  and by not  getting the  electricity up  and not  we just blew  it  but let me ask  you the electricity  and stuff  weren't they  constantly sabotaging  not that you  don't have to  overcome that  but it's not  like we weren't  trying to do it  it's like their  own people  are sabotaging  but we  there's all  kinds of  pre-war  planning  that was  done  that was  ignored  that said  that they  were going  to do  that  that said  the first  thing you have  to do  is not  allow chaos  and we 
[04:53:00]  allowed  looting  right away  and that  they did  12 billion  dollars worth  of infrastructure  damage  during the  looting  is estimated  and that's  when we  lost control  of the  country  and that's  when it  be  that's when  the insurgent  you know  the first  bomb  that killed  more than  one person  from an  insurgent  didn't happen  until four  months after  the invasion  did you think  maybe that's  when Saddam  got caught  it seemed  like a lot  of them  like what  I want to  know is  once they  realized  Saddam Hussein  was not  coming back 
[04:53:30]  that's to  me when  the country  completely  fell apart  it's like  not that it  wasn't happening  before that  but that's  when they  all went  okay now  we can do  what we  want to  do  where was  al-sadr  I think  his father  was murdered  by Saddam  he's a  cleric  where was  all the  anger  and the  militia  when Saddam  was killing  his father  where was  that  the balls  then  where was  this  well he  had  because he  had clamped  down that  country  with 500,000  troops  we have  150,000  so in other 
[04:54:00]  words  they should  be handled  yeah  well this  is what  our army  was saying  Shinseki  who the  army chief  of staff  said we  need to  send 400,000  guys in there  and Rumsfeld  no I want  to transform  the military  and I can  do this  with 100,000  yeah  and Tommy  Franks  finally got  them up  to like  150 or  something  they went  in there  and he  thought  and they  called it  mission  accomplished  and they  thought they  had done  it  and they  really  did  and  I would  really  recommend 
[04:54:30]  this  Fallows  article  in the  Atlantic  Monthly  maybe  your  listeners  aren't  smart  I wasn't  going to  say that  I was not  going to  say that  we got  some  smarties  out there  yeah  yeah  no and  maybe  they're not  they're  they're not  the type  to read  that kind  of article  even though  they're  brilliant  they  prefer  to apply  that brilliance  to gossip  together  yeah  there's 
[04:55:00]  there's  nothing  but  it's  a very  you know  there's  other  things  I mean  I've  been  just  really  engrossed  in  the  progress  of the  war  and  you know  I mean  as I say  I'm going  over there  for my  third time  you can't  go over  there  entertain  the  troops  and not  support  the troops  and not  want us  to succeed  you can't  right  it's  impossible  you know  how  emotional  that must  had to be  emotional  for you  of course  I mean  you're around  guys who are  being shot  at and  they're  happier  there  and you  know  that some 
[04:55:30]  of them  are going  to be  killed  yeah  of course  yeah  so I mean  and so  so I  and it  just makes  me mad  that  the feeling  I get  is that  Rumsfeld  doesn't  really  care  that  Wolfowitz  didn't  care  that they  and that  also  that they're  going to  continue  to  mislead  us  that's  that's the  that's the  thing  that really  drives me  crazy  is that  they  you know  you know  Cheney gives  a speech  about anybody  who says  that we  misled  you into 
[04:56:00]  the war  is you  know  doing the  most reprehensible  thing  well come on  come on  you did  you did  and you know  it  and so  stop it  and be  accountable  for your  errors  anyway  I know  I gotta  go to  something else  yeah  yeah  and another  Republican  that could  beat Hillary  Scooter Libby  Scooter  his name  that's an  adorable  cute name  Al Franken  thank you so  much  we like  when you  come on  our show  thank you
