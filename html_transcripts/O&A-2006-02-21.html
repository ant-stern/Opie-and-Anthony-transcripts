<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, as pieced together from the provided summaries, was a chaotic and highly offensive rollercoaster ride.  The show opened with the hosts and Jim Norton engaged in boisterous banter, escalating when the topic turned to intern Bobby’s unauthorized use of Anthony’s bullhorn and chair, documented in photos and video.  Bobby was brought on air, claiming it was a prank instigated by Eric (possibly E-Rock) and escalated by Danny's filming.  He even performed several bullhorn-enhanced Anthony impersonations.  This prompted criticism from caller Fuzzy, and a reprimand of another caller, Paul, for interrupting at an inconvenient time.


Following this, the show took a bizarre turn with the reading of scripts written by intern Bill. These scripts contained highly exaggerated and fictionalized (and extremely offensive) accounts of Anthony's childhood, involving graphic details about his father, and included a fictional scenario involving producer Steve offering pornography to children and a ludicrously racist portrayal of a Black History Month event.  The hosts reacted to these scripts with a mixture of outrage, amusement, and disbelief.  A listener then recounted the disturbing details of a previous "Guess the Sound" segment featuring a man using his scrotum as a dildo.


The show then transitioned to a discussion about germs and hygiene, sparked by hand sanitizer.  This devolved into gross-out anecdotes, including licking ketchup bottles and an extended, absurd discussion about pen-chewing and the hosts' suggestions for their disposal (involving their rectums). A news report ranking the germiest jobs, placing radio DJs high on the list, sparked further discussion.  This was followed by a series of offensive ethnic and racial jokes.  The conversation briefly shifted to George Carlin's comedy before a news report about a woman killed by a Long Island Railroad train led to a call from a railroad worker detailing how such accidents occur.


An undertaker, Nate, then called in, providing graphic details about his job, including descriptions of decomposing bodies and the processes of embalming, frequently employing dark humor.  The show concluded this segment with a lengthy, furious rant about Howard Stern, fueled by Stern's perceived attack on the Opie and Anthony "army" and its impact on a former Stern colleague. Opie and Anthony aggressively challenged Stern, boasting about their success on satellite radio and contrasting it with Stern’s perceived decline and negative press.


The following segment featured an extended, expletive-laden rant about Howard Stern and Robin Quivers, focusing on their perceived failings on SiriusXM, the diminishing audience, and Quivers’ supposedly worthless contributions.  The hosts bragged about their "O&A Army" – their listeners who, they claimed, were harassing Stern and Scott Ferrall through phone calls, protests, and other disruptive actions, citing specific numbers involved (e.g., 1300+ listeners on a single PalTalk feed). They repeatedly used highly offensive language, especially targeting Quivers, and boasted about their own success and growing audience, contrasting it with Stern’s perceived decline.  Stock prices of Sirius and XM were discussed, with the hosts suggesting Stern's move had negatively affected XM's performance.


Another segment featured a scathing critique of Stern’s move to SiriusXM, mocking his salary and the failure of his promotional strategies, particularly the lack of college tours. They continued to contrast their own audience size with Stern’s, using exaggerated numbers for comedic effect, and relentlessly insulted Stern's perceived self-importance. A recurring joke involved a mock "key-turning" ceremony for Jimmy, symbolizing his perceived insignificance.  Listener calls reinforced the negative assessment of Stern, and the hosts boasted about their ability to negatively impact others’ careers (mentioning Scott Farrell and Pharrell).  The conversation then shifted to listener-submitted audio of Tyra Banks discussing her fear of dolphins, followed by Opie discussing his fear of a ghostly figure in his house, which he attributed to his furniture arrangement.  The segment ended with a discussion of technical difficulties and the upcoming appearance of guest Rich Voss.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down  syndrome children.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  Hysterical.  We will be at the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  See you then. 
[00:04:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
[00:05:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Let it try now. 
[00:05:30]  Let it try now.  Let it try now.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  And, and, grr.  Good morning to you.  Ho, ho.  Can I touch my things?  Are they safe?  Can I use my slide whistle?  My other whistle? 
[00:06:00]  Anthony's a little pissed off.  Just a little pissed off today.  A little annoyed.  People around here.  Want to say hi to the past?  Yes, of course.  Want to say hi to the fans?  Fans.  Want to say hi to the listeners?  The casual listener.  The casual listener.  That might punch out of our show every so often.  Maybe listen to the Trucker Channel or 70s or I don't know.  What else is there over here? 
[00:06:30]  The casual listener that doesn't know who's who.  And doesn't even give a shit.  Justin's gotten a laugh every so often.  And every so often he checks in.  Is O.B. talking?  Is Anthony talking?  Is little Jimmy talking?  I don't give a shit.  He don't even know.  He goes, what's that guy?  Johnny Norman?  I think Johnny Norman's running on the show.  I listen to Open the Knee and Anthony.  Open the Knee and Andy.  I listen to them and they got this guy.  I think he's a comedian or something.  Johnny Norman. 
[00:07:00]  They won't know.  They don't care.  But they listen.  But they listen sometimes and laugh.  Hello to you two.  Yeah.  Deep Tracks is really boring.  So all of a sudden they pop on us for a minute or two.  And then back to Deep Tracks.  To hear Jethro Tull do a 35 minute song.  Not everyone's hardcore.  Jesus.  Holy cow.  We get it.  You play the flute.  That's great.  Great.  Oh my God.  20 minutes of that.  And then you got the hardcore listeners that know where we live. 
[00:07:30]  Know all our phone numbers.  Yeah.  Know our credit ratings.  Every appearance.  This is a twisted, twisted job we have.  If you could call it a job, I know.  It's great.  So what's wrong with you today, Anthony?  I don't know.  I got an email last night from maybe somebody in our organization.  I don't want to, you know, point fingers or anything.  But apparently, you know, again, I guess one of Ron and Fez's interns. 
[00:08:00]  Is that what he does?  What?  How did that happen?  Wasn't he a Ron and Fez guy?  Swap.  It's like a fucking whorehouse, this place with the interns.  They swapped, huh?  I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm getting pictures of him in my seat using my bullhorn.  You know how sacred my bullhorn is?  It's pretty sweet.  I don't, I wash my hands after urinating. 
[00:08:30]  And then I don't touch anything.  I do that for a reason.  I don't like people.  I don't like their germs and things all over.  This is something that goes against my mouth.  Right against my mouth.  Right on it.  Right on it.  I don't want other men's mouths broke back bullhorn.  That's what I got now.  I've smashed three of these so far.  Right?  Iraq has seen.  He's had to go out and purchase more than I've had to pull money out because goddamn they 
[00:09:00]  don't go for shit over here.  I have paid for my own bullhorns.  It's tax deductible, you know.  And you're turning Jewish.  Oy, I'm not.  Stop it.  What are you saving up to be, Anthony?  Jewish?  Jewish?  Hey, that'll take.  Who didn't even know that's tax deductible?  I don't fucking know.  Is my cab fare tax deductible?  Probably is.  Of course it is.  Whatever.  Uh, so I'm getting pictures of, um, uh, this gentleman. 
[00:09:30]  The fuck is his name?  Bobby.  Bobby.  I didn't know.  He didn't have a name tag or anything.  Sitting in my seat, um, using my, my bullhorn, you know, the instant replay, which I don't  care, you know.  Like I said, I wash my hands.  I don't think he's digging his fingers in his ass or anything and using them afterwards.  Although, who knows?  But, uh.  How about up his nose or in his ears?  Well, that could be kind of disgusting, too. 
[00:10:00]  Just point it out.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Sure.  Johnny Norman.  And, uh, well, I, I just pictures.  And then I, I hear this video of it.  Because Danny came in and, because Danny knew.  And E-Rock knew.  When they saw this, they went, eh, Anthony's the easygoing guy.  I understand.  I am, I am, I come off like the very easygoing, friendly guy.  Which I am.  I'm very friendly to everybody, uh, in the place.  Uh, until lines get crossed. 
[00:10:30]  Then, I'm more of a fucking maniac than this guy over here.  Can I make an observation, though?  Greg Opie Hughes.  I fucking, when I snap, I snap so badly.  Like, I think E-Rock saw it once.  He saw the wrath once.  Um, uh, another Ron and Fez jack off.  Saw it once.  Harry, he saw it.  A cabbie saw it Friday night when I was driving home. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, but it's just.  Oh, boy, did he see it.  Yeah, but it's just a lot of yelling.  And they know that.  You gotta pop one of these guys in the face really hard.  You think a punch will do something at some point?  And then the legend grows.  Look at my stuff.  It is exactly how I left it.  You've hit people.  Jesus.  You know that.  Not interns.  He hits people.  I've been in three or four fights live on the show.  Yeah.  And look, because of that, look, everything is exactly how I left it last night. 
[00:11:30]  Because Ron and Fez didn't do a show yesterday, so I was able to keep all my stuff out.  No one was touching my stuff yesterday.  I'm too friendly and easygoing.  No, I mean.  Yeah, no one was in Opie's seat.  Would you ever, let me ask you this.  Okay.  Would you ever have sat there and fucked with, because since Ron and Fez were not on yesterday,  Opie left instructions, just leave everything here.  That way we come in for today's show.  And it's all safe.  Everything is just like it was when we left the show yesterday.  That's very important.  Would you have sat there? 
[00:12:00]  I'm asking you honestly.  Would you have sat in Opie's chair and started fussing with anything over there from the most  smallest thing?  I really didn't think about it.  Probably not.  But that was the closest seat, and there was someone in the jump seat over there, so.  But no, I mean, let's say everything was wide open.  We'll be hypothetical here.  Would you even have thought of sitting there and fucking with Opie's CDs?  No.  Well, between the two of you.  Why?  I would like to know why, because he's a little scary.  He's a little scary. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  He's a little scary.  I'm telling you, man.  Okay.  You got the yelling down, Ant.  It's good, but you really need to pop somebody.  No, just one pop is all it takes.  I'll tell you, I would love that, but it really isn't in my nature.  But there are other things that are in my nature.  I can be the most vindictive fucking prick ever.  I would get you thrown the fuck out of here and laugh as I watch you walk down the street to the sad Hulk music. 
[00:13:00]  And then sleep like a baby that night.  Sleep like a baby.  This only happens.  I am like a lion or any other animal that sees the carcass they just took down being infringed upon by a hyena.  Don't think twice about just biting the neck and that's it.  They don't think about it that night.  You think the lion sits down and goes, I kind of felt better how to take that hyena out.  You know?  I bet it doesn't. 
[00:13:30]  No.  That's me.  I'm very cordial to everybody in here.  I smile.  I say hi.  But there is a hidden rage inside of me that I swear to you when it comes out, it is yes?  Opie, do you really want to hit that?  I am not in a fucking mood.  Exhibit A.  Exhibit A.  Yes.  The bullhorn. 
[00:14:00]  There it goes.  Ooh, that was outrageous.  No bullhorn today.  But that was outrageous.  No bullhorn.  You should have smashed it.  Someone might get to use it.  I'm sure during your show, you'll get to use it.  In all fairness, it wasn't like a malicious thing.  It was just...  The way it transpired is Eric was in the studio and it was me and Bill speaking about when we have a show, what is it going to be like?  And then...  Right.  Eric kind of jumped in and wanted to discover us and produce our show. 
[00:14:30]  So then...  They're doing radio on the planet Venus now because that is the only fucking place I can see you two doing a show is on the planet Venus.  Well, it was kind of a goof and then, you know, Eric, I don't know, it could have been sarcastic, but who really knows with him, that he said, oh, why don't you go sit in Anthony's seat?  And I said joking around...  Oh, right here, here.  Now we see.  Ladies and gentlemen, there is the shove off, the passing of the buck.  We have seen it happen.  It was right in front of you, right there. 
[00:15:00]  We saw that E-Rock is now responsible for what happened last night.  E-Rock was not responsible for what happened last night.  E-Rock was sitting there taking photos of Bobby just going amongst his business.  Because E-Rock knew this is something that just should not probably happen.  But why did you suggest that he go into Anthony's seat?  I didn't, Jimmy.  Oh.  He's lying.  What happened here?  Now you're lying.  I'm not lying.  He was looking at singles cruises or something, remember?  And then, you know, he says, we were talking about the show and he's like, oh, if you want, I'll help you out. 
[00:15:30]  You know, I think he was being serious.  And sarcastically, probably, he said, oh, you know, why don't you see how the big seat feels?  And then, you know, I kind of just moseyed over there.  Not to, you know, not to play with anything, but, and it just kind of, and then Danny ran in with the camera.  And I knew I was bagged.  There's nothing I could do after that.  So I just kind of was just joking around.  It was like a goof.  Bobby, you were not set up.  You did this on your own.  Danny just happened to have the camera, walked in and goes, hey, Bobby, what you doing? 
[00:16:00]  You were already snapping photos of me.  Yeah.  But no one told you to sit in Anthony's chair.  You said it joking around.  It seemed like a joking around manner that you said, why don't you sit in the big seat?  Right.  Like, I told you, oh, pick up the bullhorn and go, hey, this is Anthony doing Ronald Reagan.  You turn on the bullhorn and go, hi, I'm Anthony doing Ronald Reagan.  Oh, there were little impressions of me, Don.  An impersonation, perhaps?  Oh, an impersonation.  Well, that's clever.  All right.  We have that.  Do we have some audio?  I would love to hear it. 
[00:16:30]  What was that you were just playing with?  The bullhorn?  Why were you playing with it?  Because I was doing Anthony Comey doing Ronald Reagan.  Well, see?  Do it again, Bobby.  Well, see?  It's Anthony Comey doing Ronald Reagan through a bullhorn.  Do some more Anthony impersonations.  What's your favorite Anthony bit?  Well, I like when he does the Mike and the Mad Dog when he does what he did.  Do some.  Do some for me.  Gotta give him credit!  When he does the gotta give him credit? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty funny.  And it's like, well, dog.  Well, more fud.  Anthony doing it.  I should probably sit in his seat if I would.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You should do that.  Oh, there you go.  All right, it's on, Dave.  Sounds just like Iraq.  I should probably sit in his seat if I'm gonna do that.  But that point was not my voice.  That was Danny.  I know, I was kidding.  But I was in the seat already, and he was taking a picture of me already, and I figured  I was done no matter what.  I realized, you know, as he's snapping shots at me, what am I gonna do now?  That this was probably not a good thing. 
[00:17:30]  Probably not a good idea.  Yeah.  But it wasn't, like, malicious.  Like, I wasn't goofing.  I was just goofing around in general, because, you know, goofing...  I don't mind the sitting in the seat.  I mean, you know, Ronnie sits here for his show.  Another professional in the radio business, just like yourself.  And, but, you know, the bullhorn thing.  It just, that's what got me.  Understandable.  I wasn't, like...  I don't want to just...  We got more audio, though.  Oh!  More impersonations. 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  And it's like, well, dog.  Yeah.  It's Anthony doing...  I should probably sit in his seat if I was in...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You should do that.  Do an impression.  Yeah.  Because it doesn't make any sense if you're sitting at that mic.  Yeah.  This is the mic.  So.  So, like, if I was Anthony, I would just be sitting here and I go...  Like that.  Oh, wait.  There you go.  Yeah.  Did you...  VR.  That's the place to be.  See?  Or I could do, like, which one would be the car crash?  Would be...  Very last one.  That would be me, Frashing. 
[00:18:30]  Will?  You're filling all my cards.  And he touched that.  And that.  Uh-oh.  Why don't you go through the replay, find that drop of Vince McMahon going,  You're fired!  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  Do me a favor. 
[00:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  Go through this here.  Write down some phone numbers.  Okay, I'm nervous now.  You know how to do Google searches on us, all right?  I don't want to read either.  Uh, Rod and Cake Bakeries in the New York City area.  What about that other one?  Right.  I can't find the place.  Travis says one name and I'm not seeing it.  Will?  Yeah, this one's definitely better.  I'm Anthony.  Hi.  Is my bullhorn being, uh...  Look, there's Bill over there. 
[00:19:30]  He's being all...  Again.  Abused.  Or E-Rod.  In the jump seat.  Daddy!  Oh.  Yell into it more spit-wise.  Yeah.  There's so many fun little toys around here.  Tell the story about your dad and you in Capistana, California.  Listen, listen up.  I'm so wasted.  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted.  Daddy's just filled me.  You know what would be a funny gag? 
[00:20:00]  If you took Ant's mic screen and then rubbed your balls on it and not tell him...  I would never do that.  I would never do something that would be...  Very smart.  ...that would be perceived as evil.  They have you on the other hand.  I'm not trying to, you know, be a dick.  You got a comedian.  Yeah.  Well, the comedian's seat's there.  You want to be on the...  We're doing a mock O.B. and Anthony show.  No.  Bill's going to be E-Rock.  Could you be Jimmy?  Bobby, do your Anthony impersonation for Nathaniel and Travis.  Ready?  Ready?  It's Anthony doing Ronald Reagan for a bullhorn. 
[00:20:30]  Will?  See?  That's it.  That's the impression.  Oh, I'm on.  You're having fun tomorrow, Bobby.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Someone's got a hard-on for airtime.  Good call, fam.  Dan's got to really wrap it up and put the realism right into it.  That was just three minutes of awfulness.  That was really awful.  Holy crap.  What the hell goes on around here after we leave?  That's just it.  I have no idea.  The games begin as soon as we leave the studio. 
[00:21:00]  I have no idea.  Well, that was wonderful, Bobby.  Thanks for wasting 20 minutes of our show.  Yeah, that was good.  That was stupidity from yesterday.  That was good.  But how come you said Eric said to get in the seat when you clearly said...  Hold on.  And you clearly said, I should sit in the seat.  Yeah.  Well, it was being sarcastic because I was in the seat already before that while he was  taking pictures and then I got out and then Danny came with the camera and he said,  why don't you get in the seat?  And I figured I was done already anyway.  Yeah.  So there was no turning back after that moment.  All right.  And you've now worked for our show?  Yes.  Had that happen. 
[00:21:30]  Who did you trade with?  Yeah.  Who traded?  Originally, I think it was supposed to be Ray and then he got a different job.  But, you know, I don't know how...  I don't know if there was a specific trade.  How much air time did you get on RanaFest?  A lot, actually.  I thought I did pretty well.  I remember hearing you a lot.  That's going to change, my friend.  Yes.  You are what is now known as behind-the-scenes guy.  You are now known as coffee boy.  Coffee boy, behind-the-scenes guy, never-to-touch-my-shit-again guy.  Yep.  That's who you are now. 
[00:22:00]  You're now known as stop trying to make a big splash guy.  Right.  How long have you been working for this program?  I guess since January, the middle of January.  Really?  Yes.  Well, I try to stare out of everybody's way.  It wasn't, you know, like...  Good job.  I was just joking around after the show.  We usually joke around, but never to...  Just joke around.  All right.  All right.  Can we start our radio show now?  Thank you.  Thanks.  Hope you enjoyed your air time here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hope you got a lot of tapes of you on Ron and Fez. 
[00:22:30]  Let's go to Fuzzy in Connecticut.  Fuzzy!  There he goes.  Yo, I'm getting the fucking douche chills listening to this guy.  This guy's a hack.  You need to get rid of him immediately, please.  All right.  Thank you, Fuzzy.  Yeah, man.  Goes to a cubicle in the far corner of the office to sit down and reflect on his past glory  on the Ron and Fez show.  Holy crap.  Let's go to No Filter Paul.  Paul!  Hey, good morning, guys.  Do you think of anyone else besides yourself? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I think I'm going to prove I'm thinking of you guys in about the next 10 seconds here.  No.  It's four.  No, no, no.  Why are you calling?  Because I'm going to be giving out...  No, no, no, no.  Why are you calling?  Because you asked me if you could call the program, right?  Yep.  Because you want to promote something, right?  Yeah, I'm going to give out...  So why do you decide to call right in the middle of the beginning of the show where we're getting  into all sorts of shit?  Were you listening to the show at all?  Yeah.  Like, maybe you could have, like, picked a better spot to call in? 
[00:23:30]  I was going to sit on hold until you guys were ready for me.  Dude, I said you could call the show.  So at 7-0-1, he's calling the show.  It's like, relax.  Call a little later.  Okay.  Everyone knows the first half hour to 45 minutes of the show.  We don't need any phone calls.  We're usually busy with what happened last night, what's happening this morning.  But you have to jump right in because your thing is so important, right?  I just had to set my alarm because it's 4 a.m. in California right now. 
[00:24:00]  That's why.  So you even woke up at 4 a.m. to make sure you called right away.  Could have slept.  Okie-dokie, then.  No, dude, you really annoy me on a level I can't even explain.  All right, get your plug in because it's so important that you do it right at the beginning of the show.  Well, okay.  Like, right in the middle of all that stuff where we're trying to figure out what happened to Anthony's stuff  and Bobby coming in and all the guys with the video and stuff, Paul calls.  Just because he doesn't give a shit what's going on on the show. 
[00:24:30]  No.  He needs to get his thing in immediately.  No.  Go ahead, Paul.  That's not true.  I just waited on the whole few guys.  Okay, anyway, I'm going to be giving out wow stickers that ESPN's on tomorrow night, Anaheim, California, 8 p.m. at the NHL bar.  That's it.  Anyone who wants a wow sticker, come on down.  And feel free to hang up with me now.  Hey, and that's what I'm talking about.  Punch it up.  Punch it up.  Punch it up. 
[00:25:00]  Holy crap.  Yeah, he really, uh...  Like, he has no sense of timing whatsoever.  You know, there are times it is so obvious not to call the show because all hell's breaking loose or might be breaking loose, you know?  Yeah.  He just added...  What he had to say had nothing to do with the beginning of the show.  It might be more of a personal thing, I understand, but it just drives me nuts.  Because I said, yeah, call the show and we'll get a plug-in for your thing you're doing in California.  That's fine.  At 7 o'clock, as we sit down, it's ringing. 
[00:25:30]  There's the phone.  It's like, you know, stop.  And he would have sat there for, what, hours tying up that phone line?  That's what we probably should have done.  Yeah.  All right.  So you threw the bullhorn away?  Yeah, I got this one now.  You got another one, though?  Hopefully this is the, uh...  This one will work.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Will.  Will.  Will.  Is it really?  I guess it works.  Why doesn't Danny come in and tell Anthony that?  Yeah, because Danny was videotaping.  What, he used that one, too? 
[00:26:00]  I have no idea.  Danny?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Anthony was just using that bullhorn.  He used that one, too, didn't he?  Probably.  Honestly, I just, like...  I heard on the tape, he goes, this one's better or something.  It's all on video, so if you'd like to review it.  No.  Rather look at you guys in the office on the weekend than that tape.  So what goes on here after we leave?  Well, I mean, I have stuff.  We all have stuff to do, so I don't know what Bobby's doing. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I mean, to tell you the truth, I don't even know what E-Rock was doing in here after the  show.  Ooh.  No, I'm just saying he was in here.  I just don't know what he was doing.  No, I wasn't trying to shit on E-Rock.  I really wasn't.  E-Rock was setting up things with, um...  I don't know.  With places.  Bakeries.  But I just remember seeing Bill and Bobby in here, looking like they were having a ball,  and I figured it would be a perfect time to break out the old camera.  And then this morning, Bill writes, like, he wrote some script for some short little  thing. 
[00:27:00]  It was like three pages long, and it was about my life in California again.  Like, he wrote this story that had nothing to do with any...  Like, you could take what I've said on the air, the stories, and make it into a story,  but this is nothing.  It was like, I'm living in a shithole of garbage, and my father woke up drunk and tried to shoot  me, so my brother hit him over the head with a baseball bat.  Like, I read the thing and promptly tore it into a thousand pieces and threw it away, Bill.  You're fucking insane. 
[00:27:30]  I didn't like it.  You are literally insane.  Well, Bill's like, you're kind of like a writer, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A writer.  If you mean that by he can take a pen, put it to paper, and letters will come out and  form words, all right, I'll give him that.  But as far as, where did that story come from?  It was not based on anything I had spoken about on the air.  The closest thing was a gun was involved, and I grew up with guns.  Because everything else was, I woke up under a pile of newspapers and garbage. 
[00:28:00]  My brother woke up under a deflated kiddie waiting pool, and to a yelling degenerate  vagrant, who turns out to be my father.  Do we have this script?  How long is it?  I ripped it up.  Why is Bill making fun of that?  I have no idea.  Wait, do you have a copy of this still?  Yeah, I could go print it out if you want me to go get it.  Please do.  Yeah, we got it.  Please do.  How many parts are in this thing?  It was a promo.  I was going to, I was throwing it out.  We have to check this out.  A promo.  About the tales of you in California. 
[00:28:30]  But they're nothing like what I, yeah, there it is.  There it is, if you want to tape it back together.  They're nothing like what I have to explain.  I've told many, many stories about me in California when I grew up in San Juan Capistrano.  None of them included waking up in a shack with garbage on top of me.  You know, I always lived in a house.  I had horses for God's sake.  I grew up, I got a beautiful pistol for my birthday. 
[00:29:00]  And a family friend to have sex with.  And it was wonderful.  It was a wonderful time to grow up.  And he has it like, my father's all fucking hammered drunk and my brother's got to hit him over the head with a bat or he'll shoot me.  My loving father, I lost ten years ago that you're joking about, my friend.  I don't like everybody shitting on my friend Anthony today.  Jesus H. Christ.  I don't like it.  Wait, give me a copy of this, too. 
[00:29:30]  We all need copies.  I wasn't shitting on you, it was an homage.  Can you, an homage?  If homage is French for shitting on you.  By the way, I got to admit, this is a very strange way to begin our radio.  So now the phones, I can't answer any phones.  Nothing.  See, look, nothing happened, so we have to deal with that.  Fix that.  Reboot it.  Hey, wait, can we get another copy of this?  Because I'll be the narrator.  Anthony will be Teen Anthony.  Do I have to audition? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Oh, um.  Jimmy, you'll be the derelict.  Ooh!  The derelict, that's it.  The derelict is my ten years dead father.  Thank you very much, Bill.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Why do I get the sad part?  Derelict.  All right, well.  There's also a great promo that Bill wrote where Steve jumps out from behind a dumpster  to give kids pornography.  All right.  I really like that one.  At least that's based on some kind of fact.  That's a documentary intro.  Where's that script?  I think it's in the room. 
[00:30:30]  I think this kid has talent.  I think Bill has some talent here.  Thank you.  Talent?  Yes, I think he does.  In pure fantasy?  All right, narrator, this is a promo you want to make?  Well, I throw a lot of ideas around to Steve about different types of promos that are on  the breaks, and this was one idea, and I don't expect most of them to go through.  That's why I make so many.  They all should go through.  With a little disclaimer, another crazy promo by intern Bill.  Narrator, yes.  Phones work.  Thank you, E-Rock. 
[00:31:00]  This monologue should be over simple music, by the way.  Oh, my monologue?  Yeah, your monologue.  What's simple music, Bill?  What would that be?  I don't know.  Something with a violin in it.  And why did you want to use the hammer cocking sound of that?  Oh, dude, it gets insane.  When you read it, it'll make sense when it gets that point.  Can we use that audio for this?  I don't have a cocking thing.  I just have things firing.  Wait.  Oh, I thought you meant that video that we checked out yesterday.  Oh, no.  I saw a hammer cocking. 
[00:31:30]  That's click, click.  And I thought that was the video from Guess the Sound number four yesterday.  Is that video up on opiananthony.com, by the way?  It's linked up, yeah.  It really should be up there.  It should be.  If you were listening to Guess the Sound yesterday, the fourth clip was the guy with the dildo in his ass and his huge cock, I guess.  He was swinging it backwards to hammer it into his own ass.  His ball bag, yeah.  Oh, that was his ball bag?  His ball bag.  He was moving so fast, he had no idea what it was.  All right, here's the narrator in intern Bill's promo, right? 
[00:32:00]  All right.  You might know him as the host of a popular talk radio program, but few know the real Anthony Cumia.  Growing up in a broken household and then relocating to an even broker household in Capistrano, California,  Anthony Cumia lived a life of irresponsibility and danger at the hands of a neglectful parent.  Thanks to the Internet, a journal kept by a teenage Anthony Cumia has surfaced and became open to the public.  Look, these are those stories.  February 24th, 1978. 
[00:32:30]  Dear journal, it's me again, Anthony Cumia.  Today was another normal day.  I woke up frigid.  The newspapers and garbage bags I used as blankets were all over the floor.  Joe was fast asleep under his deflated waiting pool.  I snuck out to get a glass of water, trying as hard as I could not to wake Joe or the nest of raccoons in the dirty laundry pile.  When I stepped out of my bedroom, I was startled to see all the furniture turned upside down and stacked against the corner of the room. 
[00:33:00]  In front of the door was boarded shut.  I was confused until I turned around and realized I was looking into the barrel of a .357 Colt Python held by a pantless derelict.  Chick, chick.  I'd love to if I had the page.  Jimmy doesn't have the fucking page.  Jimmy doesn't have the fucking page.  There you go, Jimmy.  Now, what's my motivation?  Chick, chick.  Who the fuck is you? 
[00:33:30]  What are you doing in my house?  Dad, it's me, Anthony, your son.  Don't shoot.  Who what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh.  The smell of wild turkey and burning rubber bands made...  Emanating from him made him queasy?  I...  Grammatical error.  I have two copies of page one and I'm missing page two.  I see what happened.  We're in the middle of this dramatic reading here.  You fucking incompetent ass.  It's three fucking pages. 
[00:34:00]  All right, why don't we start over?  Oh, God.  Because it was sounding good.  We got the other sound effects, by the way?  All right, well, Anthony will do the hammer cocking sound effects.  Sound effect.  And then the music plays out through the whole thing, I guess.  All right, here we go.  I took my pants off.  Where are we going from?  We're going to start over.  Oh, Jesus.  And who's going to play...  All right, Jimmy's playing the derelict.  Who's playing Brother Joe?  And who's playing the woman?  There's a woman in the air.  E-Rock, you play the woman. 
[00:34:30]  E-Rock.  Well, he's looking at singles cruises.  Make sure we get back to that.  Ew, what a douche.  Anyone else hear that?  Mike in Philly.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  When Bob was talking before, he said something about E-Rock surfing the net looking for singles  cruises.  Yeah.  Please, let's not forget that E-Rock said that.  We'll get back to that in a little while, okay?  Okay.  Thank you.  Do we have all the parts?  They're putting out more.  We also had other scripts.  Other scripts we're getting from... 
[00:35:00]  Look at this idiot that IM'd me to tell me he just got pal talk and loves it.  Thank you.  Oh, cool.  I pardon you, asshole.  Don't IM me.  Unless it's important or unless it's a funny joke.  No, ever.  Ever, ever.  Only if it's a funny joke.  I pardon you.  Anthony's listening to his fucking mind.  I love it.  But you came real close to your first and last day.  Little by little, every day.  Chip, chip, chip.  Just a little more.  My sanity.  Goes away.  My sanity's like a big piece of granite. 
[00:35:30]  Chip, chip, chip.  I absolutely love it.  His girlfriend's going to walk in the room one day.  He's just going to be hammering boards across the door.  What are you doing?  Help me.  All right, we're getting all the scripts together.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to try this again.  Everyone have their parts?  Hey, what do you mean by the smell of wild turkey and burning rubber bands made...  Oh, emanating from him made...  Yeah, I only wrote this. 
[00:36:00]  I didn't even go back and change everything.  Wow, really?  Usually what?  You know what?  Usually I write it and then if it's a bad idea, I trash it.  If it's not, I go back and do a lot of revisions with the help of Steve.  You do.  All right, so everyone's got their part.  Uh-huh.  I'm narrator.  Anthony's teen Anthony.  Jimmy's derelict.  Who's brother Joe?  Who wants to play Anthony's brother?  Than, come on in here.  Ooh!  Than is brother Joe.  His acting debut.  And E-Rock will be the woman. 
[00:36:30]  Let's see if something works here.  No.  No.  No.  I ain't got nothing like...  I need a cocking sound effect.  Yeah, but you can just do that.  I'll just do it.  That's easy.  But I mean, it's a future reference.  E-Rock, you're going to be the woman.  Make sure you play it up, all right?  Here we go.  Derek, hit the music.  This is intern Bill's idea for a promo.  His idea that makes no sense and is based on nothing of any of the stories I've told in California.  Well, it's going to be a running promo.  There'll be more of them if you liked it, which you don't. 
[00:37:00]  I just don't understand where it comes from.  This sounds more like your life put into mine in California.  I had a wonderful life in California.  I had a horsey.  I want Steve to produce this anyway.  Oh, you just ruined his week.  Oh, my God.  Steve is trying so hard to get out of this.  All right.  Yeah, but he could be a much better narrator, and someone could imitate Teen Anthony.  It could be fun.  Oh, boy.  And then you've got to be more of a Teen Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  You've got to be a better fucking narrator.  I'm going to try.  Your narration stunk on ice.  I like my narration.  It was very dramatic.  Do you ever watch investigative reports?  You ever watch any of those shows?  I can't do Bill Curtis.  Bill Curtis is a narrator.  I can't do Bill Curtis.  Well, then do something like Clockwork Orange.  Your humble narrator.  All right.  Hit the music.  You might know him as the host of a popular talk radio program, but few know the real Anthony 
[00:38:00]  Cumia.  Growing up in a broken household and then relocating to an even broker household in Capistrano,  California, Anthony Cumia lived a life of irresponsibility and danger at the hands of a neglectful parent.  Thanks to the Internet, a journal kept by a teenage Anthony Cumia has surfaced and became  open to the public.  These are those stories.  February 24th, 1978.  Dear journal, it's me again, Anthony Cumia. 
[00:38:30]  Today was another normal day.  I woke up frigid.  The newspapers and garbage bags I use as a blanket were all over the floor.  Joe was fast asleep under his deflated waiting pool.  I snuck out to get a glass of water, trying as hard as I could not to wake Joe or the nest  of raccoons in the dirty laundry pile.  When I stepped out of my bedroom, I was startled to see all the furniture turned upside down and  stacked against the corner of the room and front of the door was boarded shut. 
[00:39:00]  I was confused until I turned around and realized how I was looking into the barrel of a .357  cold python held by a pantless derelict.  Who the fuck is you?  What are you doing in my house?  Ed, it's me, Anthony, your son.  Don't shoot.  The smell of wild turkey and burning rubber bands emanating from him made me queasy.  Who?  What? 
[00:39:30]  I'm not Anthony.  You're not Anthony.  Who the fuck is Anthony?  Who do you think you are?  Dad was obviously having one of his spells and I didn't think quickly.  If I didn't think quickly, I'd be dead.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  You're dead!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Uh, goodbye, cruel world.  I'll save you.  Thanks, Joe.  That was another close one. 
[00:40:00]  No problem, brother.  You never know when I'm going to need you to save me.  Oh, my head.  What happened?  Did I do it again?  Listen, I'm sorry, kids.  I'll tell you what you both can take the week off from school.  Hooray!  Three cheers for Daddy!  That's when I realized what the word family really means.  What's all the noise out here, honey? 
[00:40:30]  Is it the DEA again?  Baby, baby, nothing.  Nothing at all.  Now blow my kids, whore!  That's my pop!  What the hell?  All right, after the read-through, I don't find it that bad anymore.  See?  Well, I had to step out of the realism of it. 
[00:41:00]  What would you like to do next?  The Steve C. dumpster promo?  Or the acknowledge another significant moment in black history?  Oh, Jesus.  We should end with the black history one, I imagine.  Wow.  Let's do the Steve dumpster one first.  Ooh, we're all acting.  You are a madman, Bill.  We love Bill.  A madman.  All right.  These are coming out better than I ever possibly imagined.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, thanks, Dan.  You got it.  In turn, Bill, what's this one about?  Which one? 
[00:41:30]  The Steve?  This one was just another, like that one, a promo that would go in between breaks.  And this one stars Steve, though.  All right, let's get Steve in here.  We got to know what every, like who everyone is.  Okay.  There's two little kids walking home from school, and the school bully comes up and offers them drugs.  All right, who's the school bully?  Jacob.  Jacob's the school bully.  Who's Bert?  Little kid one.  Little kid one.  Melissa?  Little kid two.  Little kid two, and Jacob, again, the bully. 
[00:42:00]  Then Steve is Steve C?  Yes.  And that's the entire cast?  Yeah.  And narrator's also Steve C.  It goes in and out of calling him narrator Steve, because I've said it so many times.  Well, Steve, then, as narrator, has to deliver his lines as the narrator, and then as Steve  has to be Steve.  Well, it's always Steve.  Just, I forgot to change some of the Steve.  So Steve is the narrator, too?  And, yeah, same character.  All right.  I think Jimmy should be the bully.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I think E-Rock should be the woman. 
[00:42:30]  Of course.  He did such a great job playing the woman.  Is he Melissa?  He'll be Melissa.  He'll be Melissa.  And I'll be Bert.  Anthony should be Bert.  And that's it, I think.  What's the bully's name?  Jacob.  Jacob.  Jacob.  All right.  All right, everyone got their parts?  Nice biblical name.  They're junior high school kids.  And they're frolicking home as this?  Frolicking home.  As this takes place there, Bill?  Should there be some kind of happy frolicking music that turns ominous?  It's like an 80s anti-drug ad is the inspiration for this one.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Oh, I can't go to the phones again.  Oh, boy.  Gonna have to reboot that.  All right.  Don't worry about that.  Let's get to the problem.  Steve, there's some great phone calls coming in right now.  All right.  Steve liked this one.  Did you like this one, Steve?  I don't know.  Just say you liked it.  All right.  Fine.  I love that.  I'm going to play mine like Beaver Cleaver.  Ooh, attaboy.  Way to get in character.  A little innocent little...  What kind of music do you need here, Bill?  Um, like, uh, 1950s sitcom music. 
[00:43:30]  Like the background music.  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Yeah, that kind of...  All right.  I think I have some, actually.  Type of, uh...  All right.  Let's get some, uh, 50s, uh, sitcom music.  That?  Phil's directing and producing and writing.  This is the weirdest speaking of a radio show ever.  I don't like the fact I only have two lines.  I'd like some revisions to this script.  Okay, I'll get right on that.  I thought you were the star of this, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  I only have two lines.  I mean, I'll accept it.  It's called a cameo.  I don't mind doing it.  It's an independent picture. 
[00:44:00]  This gets you some street cred, is what it does.  It keeps you off of those big blockbusters that make it look like you're selling out.  Absolutely.  I'll get it.  All right.  What's happening there, E-Rock?  Steve's running.  He's getting some 1950s.  To get the music, because he knows exactly where it is.  He's Steve.  It's right under a trout.  Yes.  And, um, some small mammal he killed earlier, before hibernation.  It's between his milk and rape films.  Oh, wow. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  I'm so happy you guys like my stuff.  Oh, it's terrific.  I mean, you like the sex offender jingle I wrote, right?  Sex offender jingle?  Derek's got it.  All right.  Can we produce some of these, Steve?  Oh, poor Steve.  Well, you know what?  Now-  I would like to go home at some point.  The angle is, like, obviously pointing out how crazy intern Bill is.  I don't mind doing it.  The question was always, would they get used, you know, instead of me spending two days producing  something that, you know, got, eh.  Look, I think if you're going to do them, the opening should be like a movie where it's 
[00:45:00]  like a Bill, whatever the fuck his last name is, production.  Right.  And really pump it up, you know, that it's a Bill production.  Right.  I wouldn't do it without that.  And right after you say that, just do this.  Can I please point out-  With a big movie thing like, dun-dun-dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, the following is a Bill production.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  You know, something huge.  Roar.  Dino De Laurentiis or something.  We'll get it back in a second.  Fucking Hawk highlighted his parts. 
[00:45:30]  Oh my God.  He fucking took a pink highlighter and highlighted Melissa here.  Now read it.  I do too.  I do too.  So, fine.  All right.  Come on.  Here we go.  All right.  Let's get the music.  Hey, you want to go to my house after school and play Pokemon?  Hey, what are you kids doing?  Oh no, it's Jacob Goldowitz, the local bully. 
[00:46:00]  You kids want to smoke pot?  Come on.  Be cool.  Have a toke.  Hey kids, do you know who I am?  Oh my God.  It's ex-bouncer Steve C., producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Curses.  I'll get you next time.  Kids, you don't need drugs to be cool.  Really?  That's right.  Being cool is not something that can be gained by smoking a joint or shooting up heroin.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  The only way to be cool is through pornography.  Oh.  Oh my God.  Yeah, this is some quality smut.  Hey, how old are you?  Twelve.  Here's my card.  Call me in two years.  Oh, dust hands off.  Well, I guess my job here is done.  I suppose I'll be going.  Will we ever get to see you again?  I shall live in your hearts forever and ever. 
[00:47:00]  Thanks for believing.  I have no sound for that one.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Was it Steve flying away?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hi, this is Steve, and I may play a superhero on the...  Oh, we're going to back up.  Oh, sorry.  It's not very announcerous, Steve.  I hate to criticize your work.  I apologize.  I'll do better next time.  All right. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  You got the sound effect of him taking off it?  Uh, yes.  You have the better one.  I have this one.  Oh, that's a good one.  All right.  We'll use that.  Maybe the intern can come in and do it.  All right.  Go back to, uh...  Well, we could start over, actually.  Oh, boy.  It's a quickie.  Am I too menacing?  I'll take it down a notch if I was frightening anyone.  You were scary.  I like it.  You were very believable, Jimmy.  All right, good.  A lot of people tell me that.  All right.  Two junior high school kids frolicking home.  Take two. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, you want to go to my house after school and play Pokemon?  Hey, what are you kids doing?  Oh, no.  It's Jacob Goldowitz, the local bully.  You kids want to go smoke some pot?  Come on.  Be cool.  Have a toke.  Hey, kids.  Do you know who I am?  Oh, my God.  It's ex-bouncer Steve C., producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Curses!  I'll get you next time.  Kids.  Kids, you don't need to do drugs to be cool. 
[00:48:30]  Really?  That's right.  Being cool is not something that can be gained by smoking a joint or shooting up heroin.  Oh.  The only way to be cool is through pornography.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, this is some quality smut.  Hey, how old are you?  Twelve.  Here's my card.  Call me in two years.  Well, I guess my job here is done.  I suppose I'll be going.  Will we ever get to see you again? 
[00:49:00]  I shall live in your hearts forever and ever.  Thanks for believing.  Hi, this is Steve C., and I may play a superhero on the Opie and Anthony show, but I will not  always be there to help a kid in trouble.  So remember, parents, pornography is always a safe and healthy deterrent to drugs and alcohol.  What could be more important than a child's health and well-being?  The more you know.  What the hell?  That's wonderful.  You left off your home.  I like Jimmy's bully delivery better this time around. 
[00:49:30]  I agree.  I could get better every time.  I got more in character.  You really did.  I was feeling frightened.  I'm mad that you didn't do the harumph.  I didn't like it either, Opie.  I didn't want to say anything.  And Opie's foley work was fantastic.  It really was.  He did the shoes walking away, the porno box dropping on the ground.  Wonderful.  I have one writing critique.  It should be, how old are you?  Ten. 
[00:50:00]  Here's my card.  Call me in tears.  Right.  If you want accuracy.  Because 14 is completely acceptable on takes away from the joke.  Absolutely.  This is the last one.  Which one is this, Bill?  I wrote this for Black History Month, and seeing I was on a time basis, I guess I was  thinking it wouldn't be used, because it's almost over.  It's still Black History Month.  Yeah.  Right?  Check my watch.  All right.  What kind of narrator voice do you need here, Bill?  Well, the way it was going to be done, I guess, was he was going to do his deeper  narrator voice and then just do himself as Steve. 
[00:50:30]  Like a black man.  Yeah, but we can use a different voice.  Yeah, but Steve can't do both right now.  Yeah, so you could do narrator and Steve can be Steve.  Anthony will do narrator.  Do narrator.  Anthony's got to do that.  I'll be the narrator.  There.  The good voice here.  Violin music?  We got any of that?  What do we need?  Yeah?  Should it be violin music?  Well, the first part is just like a guy talking.  How about some jazz music Dirk is saying?  I think it should be something a little more, yeah, black. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  The second part, it's like Steve is sitting by a fire, and it's crackling in the  background.  He's reading a book, and you come in, and it's like, oh, hello there.  I didn't notice you come in, like that thing.  But jazz will be good.  We could use that.  Something mellow, though.  Mellow-y jazz.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, we got some?  All right, here we go.  It's time to acknowledge another significant moment in black history, as brought to you  by the Opie and Anthony Show, with your host, Steve C. 
[00:51:30]  Why, hello there.  I didn't see you come in.  Probably the most overlooked of all holidays, Black History Month is probably the most important  month in all American history.  Without the acknowledgement of white people, the black population would surely fester and  die from starvation.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Do I have to read this?  Oh, you do.  Where?  I lost my place.  Well, you might as well back up.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  And make sure you say probably twice when it's written. 
[00:52:00]  All right, cut from here.  All right, all right, all right.  I probably should have pre-read this.  Well, no.  Wow.  No, it's good you didn't, because I am, and oh, my God.  All right, take two on the Black History Month promo written by intern Bill.  We got a hit on our hands.  I can't wait for more scripts from Bill.  Here we go.  It's time to acknowledge another significant moment in black history, as brought to you 
[00:52:30]  by the Opie and Anthony Show, with your host, Steve C.  Well, hello there.  I didn't see you come in.  Probably the most overlooked of all holidays, Black History Month is probably the most important  month in all American history.  Without the acknowledgement of white people, the black population would surely fester and  die from starvation.  When you take away all their superhuman physical abilities and high blood levels of THC, you  quickly realize they are people just like you and me.  Pull up a chair, and I'll lend you a tale that's woven into the fabric of America, the 
[00:53:00]  legacy of the Underground Railroad.  It was the year...  It was the year 1849, and after escaping the rule of her slave master, a young Harriet Tubman  hijacks a passenger train traveling north on the Pennsylvania Railroad with nothing but  a peacemaker in one hand and a cool beverage in the other.  However, unbeknownst to Harriet, her actions on this day will set another staple in the  African-American community that will continue to terrorize white people to this day. 
[00:53:30]  Back to the story.  After kicking Whitey off, she derailed the train and proceeded to careen the locomotive...  careen the locomotive through the prison-like walls of a local plantation.  With the train filled with new friends, it set off a new destination, Canada.  Oh, woe is me.  Look at the time.  I hope you'll join me again soon for another look into the past.  God bless us, everyone.  This has been another acknowledgeable moment in black history as brought to you by the 
[00:54:00]  Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, and he's a complete racist.  Wow, Bill.  Not only is he a lunatic, he is a complete racist.  How is that racist?  He's just reporting what happened.  Is that the Underground Railroad?  Of course it is.  I didn't know she had a gun and a drink and hijacked a train to crash into a plantation.  I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere.  Yeah?  All right.  Who is she?  Truman Capote?  Ascot? 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Wow.  Intern Bill, everybody.  Intern Bill.  We look forward to more scripts in the future.  Now, there's a man that will get some airtime on this program.  Yes, of course.  Thank you very much.  All right.  There you go, Bill.  All right.  Security.  Security.  Hey, Bill.  Oh.  He did stop for a second.  Yeah, you got him.  Of course he did.  You got him.  We should take a break and we'll start the Opie and Anthony Show next, I guess.  We got lots to do today. 
[00:55:00]  Derek, get us out of here.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  We like to call it the ONA virus.  Want to say hi to Elvin and Yonkers. 
[00:55:30]  Elvin, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  I got to bring up that video I saw yesterday on your website.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Was that horrifying, bro.  The video from Guess the Sound from yesterday's program?  Yeah.  The guy using his nutsack as a ping-pong paddle to pang the butt.  Ping-pong paddle.  Look.  That was the most disturbing footage I've ever seen, even more so than the planes crashing  into the towers.  This guy was using his ball bag, which seemed to be huge and swollen. 
[00:56:00]  Huge.  And he had a butt plug up his butt.  He was assuming the frisk-type position against the desk.  It looked like a huge butt plug, too.  Yeah, huge.  And he was swinging his sack back and forth so hard that it would flap up and smack the  back of the butt plug and slam it in a little harder.  It wasn't just that.  I mean, the sound that he was making, that was not human sound.  Dude, that had to be dubbed.  That sounded like the Incredible Hulk.  It didn't sound like a normal man.  He was screaming with pleasure. 
[00:56:30]  It was disturbing.  That's all I got to say.  All right.  Is the video up on opandanthony.com?  Definitely, yeah.  We should give this clip to Patrice O'Neal for WebJunk 20.  Yeah.  Yeah, VH1.  I love it, too.  Let him play that one.  Thanks, guys.  Punch it in.  All right.  There it is.  We're checking out the video right now.  Is that his bag or his dick?  It's moving so fast.  It has to be his ball bag.  It's got to be his bag, because where would his bag be?  It could be tied up.  That has to be his ball bag, right? 
[00:57:00]  It doesn't look like dick.  It's got too much mass at the end.  I don't know what the hell's going on there.  That's all ball bag.  Does he have something that he put over his penis?  No.  That's his ball bag?  Dude, don't try to fight it.  It's just what it is.  Here's the audio from yesterday.  Here's the audio from yesterday.  ¶¶ 
[00:57:30]  Holy shit, Yahoo, indeed.  Yes, go to opianthony.com to check out the video.  Hey, we were talking about germs and stuff to start the show.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[00:58:00]  A little bit.  I mean, you got the soap and everything, right, Anthony?  Somebody put that there yesterday, the Purell hand sanitizer.  I really never use this stuff.  I don't think you're that bad, actually.  Only occasionally at an appearance.  If I can't get in to wash my hands, I'll use that before I eat something or drink.  Or if you grab a ketchup and there's something on it, you can go, ah, let me use that.  No, not even.  Just club soda on my hands.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  I remember being in Woolworths with my friend Dean many years ago when I was, like, 14.  And we were eating at the counter.  And he opened the ketchup bottle and just, like, licked the top around.  Oh, fuck.  What a creep.  And then just put it back, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And then Jimmy was commenting today about how all the pens are half-chewed and stuff.  I throw them out when I see them.  This is a half-chewed right there.  Who's chewing the pens?  Are they chewing themselves?  Who's chewing them?  Someone's chewing the pens.  Someone's got the nervous hat that they gotta chew the... 
[00:59:00]  Derek does it.  I will put them in my ass.  I will put the pens in my ass cheeks.  Believe me, I'll do that.  Could you please not do that?  I'm just saying, if people are daring me, I'll fucking do it.  They'll come out chewed.  Could someone please come in here with a pen in their mouth?  Strong rectal muscles.  Could someone please come in here with a pen in their mouth that they're chewing?  Who chews them?  What would you do if you saw that?  I mean, I wouldn't assault the person, but I mean, I would...  Put him up your own ass.  I just want to see if he's all talk. 
[00:59:30]  Danny, chew that pen.  I'm not putting it up there with his saliva on it.  It's already chewed.  No, no, no, no.  You don't understand what I'm saying.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What I'll do is, um...  What I'm saying is, not in front of people, but I'll put them in between my ass cheeks so the next time someone chews them...  So clean pens, you will throw up your ass.  Yeah, because then if the guy chews them, he's going to be chewing on Jimmy's ass.  All right, here we go. 
[01:00:00]  Now all you really need to do is do one of them, right?  Now I'm doing two.  All right, if you do two and mix them in, no one will help.  Jimmy now has two pens up his ass.  All right, throw them back in, mix them all up, and now...  Oh, God.  Good luck to the person that loves to chew on pens.  Oh, shit.  No, good luck to the person that wants to use a pen.  Nah, they're fine to use.  Gobble, gobble. 
[01:00:30]  Jesus Christ.  This could be one of those days.  You've just destroyed all the pens.  I didn't mean to make it hot like that by spinning in a circle, but you've got to give people a little show.  Well, we've got another picture of Jimmy's ass if you want to check it out.  Plenty of those.  It'll be up on the website very soon.  How do I look spinning?  Is I dainty?  Most downloaded ass on the internet.  It really is nice.  Jimmy Norton.  I'm like Danny Ash.  Anyway, Good Morning America did a whole piece on a radio DJ that hates germs. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know which...  Do we know this guy's name?  Like in a crazy way?  Hates germs?  Is he anyone we know in the business?  No, it's not actually a whole piece about a DJ.  They were doing a piece about some of the germiest jobs to have, and radio DJ happened to be one of those.  Wow.  Really?  Well, yeah, you are dealing with a lot of people's other shit.  I'm sure a dealer, like a dealer or a croupier or something in Vegas is another one of those jobs that are just disgusting.  What's a croupier?  It's one of the people that run the roulette table, other gaming things. 
[01:01:30]  Isn't he just a dealer?  No, dealers are with cards.  So a croupier is a what?  It's somebody that runs the roulette table.  Usually any game that doesn't involve cards.  Cards are dealers.  But he's just a guy.  You've never heard croupier?  No.  I'm a croupier.  Anyone else ever hear of croupier?  It was gray, man. 
[01:02:00]  The cards were gray.  How do you know this crap?  I think I saw that one on Discovery.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  The guy knows a little bit about everything.  I try just a tad.  And we hate you for that.  Oh, with a passion.  Croupier.  We just nod.  So do we know what the number one dirtiest job is?  If I recall, yeah, I think it was a teacher.  Teacher.  A bunch of sick kids.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Good thing they don't mention pornography, where everyone's got a cold and a dick is being  stuck in you unprotected.  Yeah.  Fucking assholes at Good Morning America.  Yeah, is that mentioned?  Porn star?  How about garbage man?  No.  Oh, good, but they really hit all the dirty ones.  How about the guy that has to kill rats in New York?  No.  There are guys in New York.  That's their full-time job, just to kill as many rats as possible.  Rat killer.  Well, Jim mentioned garbage man.  I used to haul trash for private sanitation, and I was, oddly enough, never sick.  Is a nurse in there?  Or a hospital worker?  Uh, no, I believe second was doctor. 
[01:03:00]  Family doctor has to be up there.  Yeah, doctor.  All right.  All right, well.  Teacher over doctor?  I believe so.  I think that's the way it works.  How is that?  You're working with sick, fucking contagious people.  Kids are awful, but you're not scooping out of their diapers like you are with, well.  It has to be a teacher.  The classroom has 20 kids.  Odds are, you know, there's a sick room.  Yeah, and they all give it to each other, and now you're in a room with 20 sick kids.  They're sneezing on their papers, and you're grabbing them.  But in the hospital, everybody's sick.  No, but like a family doctor, you know, you're coming in because you have a broken bone and 
[01:03:30]  for other things.  All right.  Teacher.  I'm thinking teacher, too.  Radio DJ number four, germiest job.  A new study unearthed the truth about the germs, the bacteria, the viruses you work with  every day, and the results are not pretty.  Take a look at the germiest jobs from the top.  Teachers, well, because they're around little kids.  Accountants, bankers, maybe because they shake hands, and maybe they have trouble laundering  money.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Radio DJs, doctors. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, she skimmed right over radio DJs.  Radio DJs was three.  Four.  It was four.  No, it's not.  And doctor was five.  Wait, she said, she said teacher.  Right.  And then she said.  I think the second was like banker or anybody who handles a lot of money.  Banker.  Accountant and banker.  Right, here it is.  And then.  A new study unearthed the truth about the germs, the bacteria, the viruses you work with every  day, and the results are not pretty.  Take a look at the germiest jobs from the top. 
[01:04:30]  Teachers, well, because they're around little kids.  Accountants, bankers, maybe because they shake hands, and maybe they have trouble laundering  money.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Radio DJs, doctors.  Radio DJs, that's right.  Accountants, bankers seem to be one job.  But it can't be.  Yeah, it is.  No.  You're an accountant or a banker.  Accountant, banker.  It's somebody in the money handling business.  I think that was because she said accountants, bankers, under one, like, heading.  I think Radio DJ's number three.  Over doctors. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Why would Radio DJ?  She just skimmed over it without any explanation.  Is it the fact that your mouth is shoved where somebody else's fucking mouth was?  Like on a fucking, like on your bullhorn?  Yeah, my bullhorn.  I think it has to do with, you know, Radio DJ's going to write something down and then  taking a pen that's been shoved up someone's ass.  Of someone's ass and putting it in their mouth?  Or that people have been touching and handling and then the fucking dummies are chewing on  it.  They're eating it.  And that pen is somewhere in that pile of pen right there.  Yeah, good.  Right away, boys.  Maybe it has something to do with people in the back office touching their ball bags. 
[01:05:30]  Good job.  Yeah.  All right, more on.  I think she's right.  Well, they're going to, I think she might explain a little further here at the radio  thing.  I hope so.  The water fountain in that section is no good?  Well, I wouldn't go near it.  There was hundreds of thousands of bacteria in that water fountain.  But your phone is actually pretty good and your office is better than average.  Actually, TV media does better than radio.  Radio has much germ in your offices.  That's strange.  Why?  You know, because I don't think people are watching me as closely maybe when they're on  radio.  That's funny. 
[01:06:00]  It's a hoot.  They're not watching as closely as like television.  I would love to answer the phone.  Are they saying it's just filthy people are on radio?  Yeah, the phones have taken a complete shit today.  All morning.  There's all kinds of prompts coming up just telling us that we can't use it.  Errors.  And we lost a lot of really good phone calls earlier.  Yeah.  I'll just call back.  I'll just guess who's on the line now because now we have no screening. 
[01:06:30]  Unknown.  And I don't even know what that symbol means.  That color is unknown.  There's a little house.  It's like Pac-Man.  Ooh.  All right.  We'll try again in a second.  And finally, one more dumb clip about this.  I want to get back to the business about shaking hands because we do that all the time.  And I think it was Donald Trump I heard who said he doesn't shake hands.  And that is something that people do.  In general, I mean, if you could wipe out shaking hands, would you?  Well, I think it would be better to bow. 
[01:07:00]  I think the Orientals have a good practice.  That's why the Japanese don't have germs as much or something like that, right?  That's right.  That's a good practice, actually, I think.  If you're going to shake hands a lot, just remember, wash your hands a lot because everybody's handing you their germs.  He uses the new racist term, Oriental, the latest one.  He said the Orientals do that.  Wow.  Don't you know they're Asians?  Yes.  What happens?  Well, occasionally a dink will approach you.  A bow could be good if a slope wants to say hello. 
[01:07:30]  Good to see you, zipper head.  That's a good gook.  Well, a lot of times what happens is the Jigaboo will high-five, but as we all know, the filthy kike likes to make the pinky promise.  Oriental.  Well, great.  We're in a filthy job.  Where is that Purell?  You know what?  What? 
[01:08:00]  Well, Carlin raised a good, because he's such a genius, raised a good point in one of his specials about germophobia,  and he was saying that he never gets colds because he doesn't shy away from shaking hands or any of that stuff.  There is a certain amount of it you do need.  There's a line between filth.  You know what?  Handshaking is fucking fine.  Just wash your hands.  Not right now, Anthony.  No one's going to wash their hands.  What about money, though?  Money's really dirty.  Exactly.  I don't know if money holds germs as well as hands.  By the way, Anthony doesn't think George Carlin is brilliant.  Yes, he does.  Not anymore.  No, he doesn't.  He was.  Oh, I love him more now than ever.  He was. 
[01:08:30]  I watched his special recently.  He's just now a bitter old guy.  There's nothing left of the old, fun, not mean-spirited all the time George Carlin.  Now it's just about, fuck this, fuck this, fuck you, fuck everybody.  You know, all right, we get it.  You're angry.  I like that, though, because it's like he's beyond the, this is why I like it, he's beyond  the point of having to, like, he's done so many hours of material, I mean, he's got 
[01:09:00]  like 12 hours of individual material.  Yeah.  Amazing.  And he just doesn't care about a piece, he doesn't even want applause breaks.  Okay, thank you, thank you.  He just wants to plow through.  Yeah, plow through his shit.  But he still hits you with stuff, like, fucking, he closed with a bit about there being no  God on a live special.  I'm like, what a fucking brilliant observation that is.  But he's so, yeah, he's got these great observations and thinks, you know, he's got these ideas. 
[01:09:30]  It's more like ideas that are going to save the world.  How about some comedy?  He still makes me laugh.  He's got these monologues that go on and on.  Shut up.  Dude, he still makes me laugh.  Where's the joke?  Colin likes his old stuff.  Me and Colin in an argument one time, he likes his old stuff better, too.  Yeah.  The more, I haven't seen his new ones, but, like, the last one I saw is You Are All Diseased,  and I like that better than anything I ever saw him do before.  Because you're a lunatic.  Dude, it's just mean.  He fucking just shits on people.  I love that.  He doesn't want their applause. 
[01:10:00]  I don't mind the shitting on people, but make it funny.  I don't find them funny anymore.  I haven't seen them.  I watch it, it's like you're being lectured.  By an old, bitter guy.  It's like your fucking neighbor calling you over and just bitching about shit in his life  that pisses him off.  I just love it.  You don't want to burn that bridge, do you?  No, I really do love him, man.  I love Colin.  That bridge.  How do you not love him?  Speaking of no God, another example of there is no God.  Yeah, these come up every so often, don't they?  Man sees sister die in Long Island Railroad horror. 
[01:10:30]  One of the stories we didn't get to last week.  A woman rushing to her church.  Ah, there you go.  Going to praise God.  Was struck and killed by a Long Island Railroad train yesterday as her brother looked on in  horror, police and relatives said.  How do you get hit by a train?  Aren't they really big and loud?  How the fuck do people get hit by trains?  Sneak up on you.  They sneak up on you.  Ding, de-ding, de-ding. 
[01:11:00]  Boom!  They don't sneak up on you.  You can hear them coming a mile away.  Gnarrr, gnarrr.  They're rattling down the tracks.  Rattling.  Yeah, you feel everything shaking.  Vibrations.  How the fuck do you get hit by a train?  Sometimes you just don't see them coming.  There are plenty of ways to die in this world.  Plenty of ways.  And most people have no clue how they're going out. 
[01:11:30]  I can guarantee I'm not getting hit by a train.  I will guarantee that.  If I do, if I go out getting hit by a train, you have permission to laugh at me.  All right.  No, you're going to go out in a boarded up place under police fire.  Or a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  They're going to find you in your Nazi coat with a hat on and fucking black Nazi gloves.  Next to your body, a bag filled with your own nails that you had to save. 
[01:12:00]  A bunch of Purells empty.  They find it in your stomach and your esophagus.  That would be great.  That would be great.  News reports just talk about how many ridiculous amounts of weapons they found in my house and ammo.  Love when people go out like that.  Well, this lady died rushing off to church.  Rushing off to church and gets hit by a loud, big chunk of metal on metal wheels. 
[01:12:30]  You would think God would go, yeah, you know what?  Not today.  It's on a track.  They can't even swerve to hit you.  Right.  It's not like, well, I was walking and a train swerved.  You know, it saw something on the tracks.  So it swerved and hit me and then went back on the tracks and was on his way.  It's a track.  You can only get hit by, you can only get hit by a train if you are in between about a six foot wide swath. 
[01:13:00]  Unless something really bizarre happens and the train derails, but that rarely happens.  People that get hit by trains usually get hit on the tracks.  You know you're on the tracks.  Holy shit.  The better chance of one of those cartoon type situations where a safe falls on your head when the guys are trying to crank it up to that window.  Because that happens every day.  You just never know, though.  You could be walking.  There could be a safe over your head.  You don't know.  There's no safe above you sign.  That was the dumbest thing growing up. 
[01:13:30]  All the people getting hit on the head with safe.  With the safe or the big grand piano.  Right.  How many of those did they have to load up to the tent story?  Plenty of people getting pianos through their window.  Well, you never saw, you never saw like somebody on the other side of the tracks that you needed to talk to and were running along.  Yoo-hoo.  And the train sneaks up on you.  Well, we got a guy that works for the railroad.  Let's see how this is possible.  Brandon in California.  What's up, buddy?  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, this is how they get hit out here, man.  They'll sit there and they got those iPods. 
[01:14:00]  And they're walking down the track, looking down, listening to the iPods.  Smack.  Who walks on the train track with something blocking their hearing, not facing the train?  That's true.  Again, sir.  Just because you can't hear.  They do it all the time.  You know you are approaching a track.  They got signs out here along the railroad tracks that say,  1-800-SUICIDE.  Really?  I will take pictures.  I'll send them to you guys.  What do they do when they call and they give you the train schedule? 
[01:14:30]  They go, right, just stand there for about a half hour.  6-15 should be coming through soon.  That's your next choice.  I'm trying to kill myself.  Well, look, we had track delays.  You'll have to wait.  Nah, it's just, you know, plus when we work out here, the wind's blowing.  You can't hear the train coming the other direction.  Yeah, but you're on the track.  It's the way it is, I hear it, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Guys, was she walking or in a vehicle?  She was running.  All right, running.  Because I think that one guy.  She was running for church. 
[01:15:00]  That one guy is saying they pull up bumper to bumper.  Right.  What's this about?  Craig.  Hi, Craig.  Why is there a buzz on the phone today?  Yeah, there is a wicked buzz going on.  But what's going on?  Hey, the reason these people get hit by trains is they pull up bumper to bumper at the crossings.  Yep.  Trying to get across because they can't sit there 10 feet back and take a chance that they've missed the light at the next intersection.  Here's another thing I've seen that I've never, ever done in my life. 
[01:15:30]  You pull up to the train tracks.  Somebody is across the tracks.  Stopped.  You pull up right behind them on the tracks waiting for the light to turn green.  You ever see the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding when someone's in there and watch the panic on their face and laugh at them?  Do they drive through it?  You have to drive through the thing.  Well, sometimes they're pulled up so close to the guy in front of them, they can't.  Go around them.  Hit, hit, hit.  Do something else.  Right.  You got to get off the track, but you shouldn't be on there in the first place.  Right.  Unless you can make it completely across, you don't fucking stop on the track, but you see it all the time. 
[01:16:00]  Craig?  Yes.  Thank you so much.  I would love to hang up on you, but I now can't hang up on anybody.  Oh, why can't we?  They're not part of the show.  The radio show is yours.  The Jimmy and Craig show.  So say whatever you want, because I can't do it.  Look, I can't get rid of you.  Thank God you're a fan and not trash us.  Craig, you just say whatever the hell you want, because look, I can't get rid of them.  Look, look.  All right.  This is my dream come true.  All right.  See you guys.  Don't hang up, Craig.  We need you.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  Now I can hang up on you until that problem happens for the 10th time this morning.  Yeah.  There's like a weird squeaky humming noise.  Nate in Florida.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up, Nate?  Hey, I'm an undertaker.  How about that?  Hey, there's a cute little job to have to go to every day.  I'm in the back of the van right now.  What's in the back of the van right now?  A 77-year-old woman.  Hey, dude, please, can you do this?  Can you pull over and go in the back of the van for a second with the phone? 
[01:17:00]  Nothing bad.  Can you do that?  Hold on.  Please.  You just picked up a 77-year-old?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  And the connection to the desktop director, DD2, has been lost.  Assistant producer is changing to passive mode.  Hold on.  Is he still there?  That's how we have to answer phones.  Don't fuck with it.  Don't fuck with it.  Don't touch it.  Just don't touch anything.  Don't touch anything while this guy's on the phone.  What did she get picked up for?  Natural?  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  She was at an assisted living facility.  Yeah.  Assisted dying, apparently.  Well, yeah.  Don't make it sad.  So you're killing my phone here.  So she's in the back.  What did you put her in?  She's on a gurney, wrapped in a sheet, covered in a shroud.  Oh, okay.  A shroud.  So her face isn't, like, her face isn't visible?  No, no, no.  She's covered.  It's the Shroud of Ethel.  Right.  The sacred Shroud of Ethel.  Or some other sexy name.  Gertie.  What's her name?  What's her first name?  No, don't say it.  Don't say it.  I can't say it.  I can't divulge any information. 
[01:18:00]  The guy's already playing.  He's already playing with us here.  So let's keep it very basic.  Dude, I really wanted him to go back there and slap her face on the air.  I wanted to hear him slap her face.  I can let her with a taser if you'd like.  Smack old Gertie in the face.  I wanted to hear him smacking her face.  Her final resting place, she's on a shoulder on 280.  No, that's a very, very serious, felonious offense.  Oh, shit. 
[01:18:30]  I don't think that's a felony.  No.  Oh, absolutely.  She said she wouldn't shut up.  She's got to be misdemeanor.  Drop her off at Starbucks.  Just prop her up for the afternoon.  Or dude, quote unquote, accidentally open the back door and drive away quickly.  So she rolls out.  Dude, what's she wearing?  A hospital gown.  A hospital gown?  Is it open in the back?  Yes.  Can you maintain an erection on the radio?  This is really twisted, man. 
[01:19:00]  This is not right.  Goddamn, that is awful.  Loves the show, guys.  It's awesome.  So you're going back to the funeral home?  Yes, you're going to the funeral home.  And then what?  You slide her in a little icy drawer for a little...  Put her in a cooler.  Put her in the cooler, and then the family comes and makes some arrangements, and you embalm  her.  The arrangements are made.  Will this one be getting...  Actually, I picked up Terry Schiavo from the medical examiner's office, took her to the  crematory.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  You got a celebrity.  Pinellas Park, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  Huh?  Yeah.  I'm in Pinellas Park.  I'm in Pinellas County, Florida.  That's where she was at.  Did she still have that look on her face?  She was hot.  Even after an autopsy, you know, where they took her brain out and everything.  They took her brain out?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fun.  She just posted the...  What did they do with the top of her head afterwards?  Don't they got to kind of glue...  They throw it back on.  They got to glue you back together.  Do they have to do surgery to take her brain out or did they just shake her head and it  fell out from the ear?  That little walnut. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Reach in and grab it.  Yeah.  Well, when you get done at the medical examiner, if you die and you're under 50 or they don't  know how you died, if you didn't have cancer or leukemia or something, you go to the medical  examiner.  They cut you open and find out.  Well, when you get done, they take your brain and all your guts and throw it all in  one plastic bag and chuck it in there and just sew you up.  Well, like in your chest cavity or something?  In your chest cavity, yeah.  And it's only about four stitches.  It's that they don't do...  You know, they're not there to do.  Right.  Right.  Oh, my God. 
[01:20:30]  So now what's going to happen to this lady you got in the back?  She's going to be embalmed.  Why?  It's party time.  In Florida, there's a 24-hour period between death and disposition that if you're going  to be cremated, they can't do anything to you.  You have to be put in a cooler.  Right.  But if you're going to be buried, you have to be embalmed within 24 hours.  Will she be getting hair and makeup?  Oh, absolutely.  Hair and makeup.  What's she look like?  Is she fat, skinny?  No, luckily, she's only 80 pounds.  I like the little ones.  The big ones.  I like the little ones. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I get from people all the time.  You know, how can you do that?  Because I drive the meat wagon.  I pick up people.  And I live in, you know, God's waiting room.  So people die here religiously.  A bunch of old people.  Oh, my God.  Especially now in the wintertime, people that come down first class, they go home freight.  Does it ever bother you when you're picking these people up?  Only when they don't get discovered in like the first two weeks.  If they've been there for a while, especially in the summertime, you get what's called a  decomp.  Yeah.  They're, you know.  They stink.  You have to throw, you have to throw a sheet over them and pop them before you move them 
[01:21:30]  because the fluid builds under the skin.  Oh, God.  Dude.  That's got to be fun.  It's like stepping on those, those packing things, those plastic packing things.  And you can't, if they're heavy, if they get, you know, real heavy, you can't pull on their  flesh because it flays off the bone.  You have to take like towels and wrap it around their ankles and wrists and carry them by their  ankles and wrists because the meat just flays off the bone.  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:00]  God damn.  Dude, do they ever smell bad?  Yeah, I ordered off eBay.  I have a cool, awesome old Russian officers from the 50s gas mask that I wear when I show  up to the decomps.  Yeah, I got one of those.  Yes, I got one of those.  Of course you do.  Yeah, I know you do.  Oh, so sometimes you go in there wearing a gas mask?  Oh, yeah.  You have to because the flies and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Do you ever have nightmares?  Nah.  The worst one I ever saw, the guy was about 600 pounds and was in a single wide mobile 
[01:22:30]  home, and the dude had gotten so fat, he couldn't walk through his bathroom door, so he would  just back his ass up to the door and just projectile shit into the bathroom.  You gotta do what you gotta do, right?  So did he ever miss the toilet?  They had to cut him out of there with the jaws of life.  He couldn't get out of his door?  No, they couldn't get him out of his trailer. 
[01:23:00]  So they opened up the trailer like a tin can and just pulled him out?  Like a tuna can.  Who brought him food?  I don't know.  I don't know the people.  They're dead.  Did he smell?  It was the worst thing I have ever, ever.  I mean...  I was distracted.  Can we back up a second?  Was it a Munaki?  Yeah.  How much crap was in the bathroom, did he say?  Oh, piles.  Piles of shit in the bathroom.  Just piles everywhere?  Dude, yeah.  It was the worst thing I've ever seen.  You ever get the heebie-jeebies driving at night, maybe, and there's a body in the back, 
[01:23:30]  and you look in that rearview mirror, and just...  You ever get the heebie-jeebies?  You know, you'd be surprised.  I talk to a lot of nurses who, you know, can't handle dead people, you know?  And they're like, don't you, you know?  I'm like, look, live people are way more dangerous than dead people.  And look, if the dead come back to life, yeah, I might die first, but we're all fucked.  You know?  This guy has this whole rationale on the whole thing.  Like, you have to to do what you do.  You have to, because people tell me all the time.  How can you pick up kids? 
[01:24:00]  I go, they're light.  You gotta be polite.  How can you pick up kids?  They're light.  You know?  You get five, six hundred pounders that are on the floor.  Because I pick up people from the house.  You know, when they die at home, you gotta go get them.  People die on the toilet.  People die in their backyard.  I picked up, you know, a lot of people off cruise ships that die on cruise ships.  So I guess, just to be practical, every time you get your phone rings, you're rooting for SIDS.  Or something that's easy on the back.  I'm just saying.  Every time my neck tugging is off, I'm praying for a Shivo. 
[01:24:30]  Because, you know, when they starve them to death, you know, they're easy pickups.  So how many do you do a week, on the average?  No, during the busy time.  There's a busy time to die?  The rush.  What's the busy time to die?  The winter time in Florida, we do twice as much as the...  I usually pick up about four or five a day.  You know, the company I work for handles about 30 a week.  And that's because of the cold weather on the old people?  Oh, yeah.  The snowbirds come down, and then, you know, when they die, we take them back to the airport. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, you gotta just call us every time you're picking up somebody.  Hey, when I get somebody good, I'll give you a call.  I'm on PowTalk all the time.  Really?  All right, well, you know...  What are you, cadaver?  I'm Nate the Undertaker.  Oh, cool.  Nate the Undertaker.  Is that your real name?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Hey, Nate?  Yeah?  Do you have any pictures of the fat guy's fucking place after he's shit all over the place?  Jimmy, you'd love my job, dude.  I get shit on all the time. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that.  Not by a body.  Huh?  Come on.  Hot old broads, crap on you.  I mean, what else?  I see 105-year-old vaginas.  I see a guy the other day.  He had been catheterized so many times.  His dick looked like a hot dog that had been in the microwave too long.  Why?  What do you mean?  Because the catheter tears it up.  When it's constantly being catheterized, it blows it out, bro.  And a bunch of scar tissue in there?  Oh, foulness.  I was messing with a guy at the crematory.  I was dropping a guy off that had two cock rings, and I had hired a new guy at the crematory 
[01:26:00]  I go to, and I said, hey, you seen anything yet that, you know, really fucked with you?  And the guy was like, no, not really.  I go, well, take out that guy's cock rings.  He enjoyed that.  He had to take out his cock rings?  Well, yeah.  Why can't you just shove him in and burn him?  You can, you know.  Pick him up later.  The family wants all the jewelry back.  No, they don't come out.  They're, you know, the kind that clamp in and didn't come out.  Yeah.  And we were just messing with the guy, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Some of that gallows humor.  Yeah, your family gets your ashes. 
[01:26:30]  There's just two fucking black circle rings and a pile of ash.  What were these for?  Do you like your job, Nate?  What's that?  You like your job?  I love it.  What does that pay?  What do you, how do you do?  I make, I make good money.  Yeah?  Well, how much?  We don't know you.  65.  65 a year?  Not bad.  What did you want to be when you were growing up?  Oh, God.  Because no one goes and says, you know, this is what I want to be.  I want to be an undertaker.  No, I kind of fell into it.  Yeah?  But look at the numbers. 
[01:27:00]  You would appreciate this, Anthony.  The baby boomers turned 65 this year.  Yeah.  A lot of them.  95 million people.  Are going to die in the next 15 years.  Because of the baby boom.  It's a growing industry this guy's in.  Yeah.  Everybody needs you once.  What's the, he's got all the lines.  Yeah.  He's got all those undertaker lines.  You go to the conventions and shit.  You know, you do all the stuff.  You do the junkets.  You go look at the new equipment, you know.  The new equipment.  There's like shows, like the electronics show and stuff. 
[01:27:30]  Like CES.  Yeah, there's the undertaker show.  What's some of the new equipment that's made the job a little easier?  Oh, the new embalming equipment, new gurneys.  You know, there's just all sorts of stuff.  It's not the same thing where you take that big fucking syringe looking thing and shove  it through the neck.  Well, it's all the same, but there's more efficient, you know, transfer equipment and  better chemicals.  And it's computerized.  Is it true you've got to hang the dead body to let all the food, is it true you've got 
[01:28:00]  to hang it?  No, you don't hang them.  I think it's a tilting table, right?  Yeah, it's on a tilting table.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'll take pictures of an empty embalming room and send them to you.  I've seen them in movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's six feet under?  Six feet under is one of the most realistic depictions of a funeral setting, home setting  you'll ever see.  It's like that.  You know, we're all sick.  All right.  Well.  Wow.  Cool.  All right, Nate.  Yeah.  All right.  Nate the ghoul.  And how many more you got today, you think? 
[01:28:30]  Dude, I go get them when they die.  You can't arrange this sort of thing.  Yeah.  Who is he?  God?  Yeah.  Just hope for him.  Reaper?  I have one.  We have one at 630.  That's not that stupid.  I'm thinking the home office has already called and go, all right, when you, you know,  drop this one off, we already have another one.  And then my next toe goes off, I go get another one.  I'm hoping that the Oregon euthanasia laws pass because then we can schedule these  things, you know, nine to five type stuff.  Right.  No more having to get up at two in the morning and go get some old lady. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  All right, Nate.  Very interesting few minutes here.  All right.  Love you guys.  See ya.  See ya, buddy.  Hi, man.  There you go, Nate.  The phones are really fucked up.  It's driving me nuts.  Can we even answer them at this point?  Nate's quite a ghoul.  I'm glad we didn't lose him on the phone.  We're going to take a break, try to figure out the phone situation.  All right.  We'll continue.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:29:30]  The number one satellite radio company, by the way.  That's it.  There's no denying that one.  There's no denying it.  There's no spinning that.  Number one.  I guess Howard is just going off on O.P. and Anthony.  Just going off. 
[01:30:00]  Just losing his fucking mind.  He lost his mind.  He snapped.  Oh, we better back off now.  We better back off.  The army fucking got him to snap.  Job well done.  By the way, they're a pest, Howard.  Because every other morning zoo in America has a cute little army where you get on their mailing list.  And, hey, army, we're going to be at a bar.  And it's going to be two for one.  And wings are going to be five cents apiece.  Join us.  That's like army crap.  Right.  We have what's called pests. 
[01:30:30]  Pests.  The pests have formed their own army.  And, boy, they are a force to be reckoned with.  Tell you that.  These guys, I guess Pharrell, Scott Pharrell, used to be a friend of ours when he was on WNEW doing mornings.  Turned his back on us.  Bad-mouthed us.  Went over to Howard.  Sucked Howard's dick.  Trying to get a job over there.  And for the entire time he was on the air, all of his phone calls were nothing but pests. 
[01:31:00]  Just ragging him, doing O&A references.  It was hysterical.  And he bad-mouthed the show completely unprovoked.  Yeah.  Completely unprovoked.  And that's why we had such a huge problem with Scott Pharrell.  Just to kiss the ass of the guy that fucking hates us.  So the pest took over one of Howard Stern's channels on Sirius.  We got huge publicity out of it.  It was the pest channel.  We got huge exposure out of it.  Yep.  The pest completely controlled the situation.  Yeah.  To the point where they said goodbye to Scott Pharrell, supposedly. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, he's not on.  I mean, I don't think they've replaced him with anybody.  If he was doing such a good job, wouldn't they just leave him there until the next, you know, audition or whatever it is came through?  The guy's show was destroyed by the pest.  It was the pest's show.  So?  Well, we're getting reports Howard's losing his mind.  Of course he is.  And he's talking about the ONA Army and Opie and Anthony.  And by, what did he say?  The snap of his finger he'd get us fired and kicked off satellite radio.  From here?  Here's how delusional this fucking over-the-hill idiot is. 
[01:32:00]  He thinks that by being at the competing company, the only competing company with XM satellite radio,  that with the snap of his fingers he can get us fired from here?  Do it.  Howard.  Howard.  This is directly to you.  Do it.  Go ahead.  I would love to see how that's done.  I would love to see how you can snap your fucking fingers and get us fired from the competing fucking company.  Show us your power, Howard.  Do it.  I'm telling you to fucking do it. 
[01:32:30]  Show us your power.  Snap those fingers, Howard.  Snap away, Howie.  Snap away.  Now they got the ONA Army, brought in zero people.  I got news for you.  Zero people.  All right, hold on.  First of all, when they were attacking Pharrell, it was over 1,300 people.  1,300 people on Pal Talk alone.  Right.  There was more people that don't have the Pal Talk that were involved in the Scott Pharrell.  On Pal Talk alone, pounding him. 
[01:33:00]  Pounding him.  And if it wasn't much of an army, why is he talking about it?  Why even talk about it?  Obviously, we made an impression in your little mind there, Howie.  Now they got the ONA Army, brought in zero people.  I got news for you.  If I was at ONA, I'd be beside myself.  Those guys at XM and Sirius, we're both talking to them because they can't get a job on regular radio because...  Sorry.  Let me tell you something there, Howie.  We couldn't because we were under contract with Infinity for the two years that we were fired because they were afraid that if we were released from our contract, 
[01:33:30]  we would compete with you and take away some of your fucking listeners.  That's why we weren't working, not because we were blackballed.  That's first of all.  Secondly, we get offers every fucking day to go back to terrestrial radio.  I'll say that.  Talk to Bob Eatman.  Give Bob Eatman a call, Howard.  Ask him.  I give Bob permission to tell Howard Stern what offers we have on the table.  And what offers we had when we were sitting at.  And what offers we've turned down on terrestrial fucking radio. 
[01:34:00]  We get them every day, Howard.  Every day.  And remember the lawyers?  You know the lawyers from Infinity Broadcasting.  You know them.  You know the piece of paper because you were involved in that.  The Howie Clause.  They would let us out of our contract so we didn't have to sit out for two years.  If we sign this contract, which basically said you will not talk about Howard Stern or any other present or past Infinity employee.  Who runs Infinity? 
[01:34:30]  Joel Hollander, right?  Call Bob Eatman and ask him about some conversations he's had with Joel Hollander.  That's all I'll say.  You do the rest.  Make the fucking calls.  Get some facts, asshole.  And Sirius, we're both talking to them because they can't get a job on regular radio because of what they did in the church.  And those guys, each one, Sirius NXM, gave me a call.  Howard, can we employ these guys?  Will you give us permission?  Oh, you're such a liar! 
[01:35:00]  All right, that's one of the best ones I've heard of.  And I can hear it in your voice and your listeners can hear it in your voice.  Do you hear them all stuttering before that?  You fucking liar!  Dude, listen to the setup before...  What a fucking phony you have become!  Listen to his setup before that lie.  He's all shaky.  His voice is fucking shaking because he's lying.  Because he knows he's losing the battle.  You don't have that kind of fucking power anymore, Howard.  Those guys, each one, Sirius NXM, gave me a call. 
[01:35:30]  Howard, can we employ these guys?  Will you give us permission?  I sat there like the godfather.  I go, what do you want?  I go, would it be all right if we employed Opie and Anthony Army?  I said, look...  Opie and Anthony Army?  There wasn't even an army then.  It wasn't even like that.  He's losing his focus and everything.  Dude, he's losing his fucking mind is what he's losing.  Guys, guys, Pess, you're driving this motherfucker crazy. 
[01:36:00]  You're putting him over the edge.  This is great stuff.  We're getting there, trust me.  Holy shit, we're getting there.  Chip, chip, chip.  We know this is a very long battle, but guys, we're getting there.  Chip, chip, chip.  We are getting there.  I read on the message boards all the time about, hey, guys, why don't we attack Howard?  Why don't the Pess get on and attack Howard?  Dude, see what's happening?  This is the strategy.  Through what you do on the peripheral, it affects this motherfucker so much he can't sleep at night.  Listen to a man losing his fucking mind. 
[01:36:30]  Our strategy is very simple.  Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.  Sometimes you've got to be very, very patient.  You don't go directly at this guy.  You never have.  That's never been the way to deal with Howard.  Chip away at his credibility.  Chip, chip, chip, chip.  Chip away at his staff.  Chip away at his fucking, now chip away at people he wants to hire.  Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.  And slowly but surely, you get releases like this that show how effective this tactic is. 
[01:37:00]  This is the sound of a man losing his mind.  I go, do you think, would it be all right if we employed Opie and Anthony Army?  I could give a shit who you employ.  I'm putting you on a no cursing band.  Employ whoever you want.  My cursing's funny.  No, it isn't.  You're one of the worst.  I said, listen, you could employ whoever you want.  But can you imagine, with one flick of my finger, I could have kept them both off satellite. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, you couldn't.  I mean, for crying out loud, how does that make you feel at the end of the day when you're such a maggot?  No, you fucking, when you're such a maggot.  Well, I always say, how does it make you feel that nothing happens when you're talking?  Shut up, Paul!  No.  With XM.  Nothing.  On the other hand, I see...  People hardly reported on it.  Hardly reported on it.  Okay.  Hardly reported on what?  Because I was too busy losing my mind.  People hardly reported.  I actually tried to have something to say there.  People hardly reported on the fact that we got hired by XM when we got hired by XM.  That's just false. 
[01:38:00]  That's another bit of bullshit.  Do your research.  We got fine.  Plenty of coverage.  We got a lot of national exposure.  Plenty of coverage.  Did we get as much as Howard?  No.  No, because he's Howard.  But did we get a lot of national exposure?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We were completely satisfied with the coverage we got.  We're completely satisfied with the way things are going.  We're getting listeners piling on to this program on a daily basis.  How are you doing over there, Howie?  How's it going?  Subs dropping off a bit?  Yeah.  Getting a little nervous, are you?  This fucking rant right here proves he's getting a little nervous. 
[01:38:30]  They were crowing about how XM had a bad quarter over the past three months, and the next day, serious results came out, and they were worse.  They didn't say boo.  They didn't say boo.  But he's saying it all right now.  You could hear it in his fucking voice.  His life depends on this.  His life depends on this deal working for him.  It's not even his life, his ego.  Yeah.  His overblown ego. 
[01:39:00]  And listen to him.  Do you honestly think – let me try to rationalize this for everybody out there.  Do you honestly think that two competing companies at each other's throats are both going to listen to this one guy who is going to determine who you hire or don't hire regardless?  Like Howard goes to Sirius.  Like he had any power over who XM can or can't hire and vice versa.  Let's say he came to XM. 
[01:39:30]  Do you think he'd have any power over who Sirius hires?  No.  He's delusional.  He's got this delusion that he's all-powerful and transcends corporate fucking greed and corporate tactics and strategy.  What a fuck – he's – dude, he's losing his mind, and I can't tell you how happy I am and how much I'm enjoying listening to this.  It's killing him that he went from a huge audience to a very, very small audience.  See, when we went to satellite radio, we had nothing to lose. 
[01:40:00]  We had no audience.  So every day when we get the numbers of more people coming on to our program, it's exciting to us.  It's growing every day.  Slowly but surely for the last 16 months, it's just going tick, tick, tick, tick up, and our audience is just growing across America.  To him, he was in the position where he had a massive audience, millions upon millions of listeners, and went down to way below a million listeners.  And that's driving him fucking nuts.  Driving him nuts.  It would have drove us nuts. 
[01:40:30]  Howie, you got a lot of press when you went over to satellite.  I'll give you that.  Got more than we did.  That's for sure.  Let's talk about the press that we've both gotten now since we are on satellite radio.  We've been here well over a year and –  About 16 months.  This is called –  A year and a half or whatever it is.  I don't know.  In February.  We've been here.  The articles that have come out about this program have been positive articles.  Very positive.  People enjoy the show.  They love the interaction with the audience. 
[01:41:00]  They comment on that.  They comment on how we have a twisted take on things and we're able to discuss any subject matter on satellite.  Those are the articles they do on us.  What do they do on you?  Every article I've read that's come out since Howard's gone to satellite has done nothing but bash him.  How he claimed to – he was going to revolutionize the industry yet again.  This big thing, it was all about a big revolution and a new revitalized and energized Howard Stern show coming to an uncensored medium. 
[01:41:30]  And what do you do?  You re-tape old bits.  People are calling you tired, uninventive.  These are things I'm reading in publications like Rolling Stone.  All the big newspapers in the major cities are all just commenting on where's the revolution?  Where's this big fucking revolution? 
[01:42:00]  It ain't there.  You don't have it left in you.  Take your check and shut your fucking mouth.  And don't worry so much about us and our army.  The thing with Pharrell, I'll throw your bone there, Howard.  It wasn't even about you.  It was about him being a fucking asshole.  But apparently it got under his skin a little bit, the army.  And for the pest, some emails and some calls, very basic stuff.  Just go, ha, ha, ha, you're not getting Topey and Anthony.  Yeah.  How does that feel, Howard?  Show them that there's three or four listeners in the pest army. 
[01:42:30]  Obnoxious laugh, you're not getting Topey and Anthony.  Nice try, though.  Yeah.  Let him know.  I was insulted.  I'm reading one, you know, I'm ready to gloat and I'm reading one article and they have me pictured up against Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  In a little publication called USA Today, by the way.  Go get the USA Today article, please.  That little periodical.  A boss wants an article.  That, and here, again, people, that bugs the living shit out of him. 
[01:43:00]  Because they say, Sirius has Howard, XM has Opie and Anthony.  There's the comparison that's always made.  We pushed and pushed and got under everyone's skin until they had to acknowledge that that's what the battle is.  Opie and Anthony versus Howard Stern.  And we're not afraid of that battle.  He hates the fact that we're successful.  He hates the fact, and this is the truth, too, hates the fact that we are not on his channel.  That he had to hire the likes of Bubba and try out people like fucking Pharrell when he knows damn well if we were on his channel, if it was Howard in the morning and us doing afternoons, say, over there, it would be huge. 
[01:43:30]  And he knows that, and it bugs the shit out of him that there's no talent pool to pick from, and we're over here bashing you, and there ain't shit you can do about it.  Flick your finger, motherfucker.  Flick your finger, this is another article that just came out yesterday.  We're in all the articles. 
[01:44:00]  We can't even keep track of all the articles we're in.  This was in USA Today yesterday, and we didn't even talk about it.  Satellite radio rivals mine new revenue streams.  Ad sales can be major for shows built around celebrities.  The article starts off by saying, Howard Stern versus Opie and Anthony.  That's how the article starts.  There it is.  And that's driving him nuts.  Drives him crazy.  Driving him nuts.  And there's a picture of Anthony and I, and there's a picture of good old Howie.  Howie.  With his poodle wig. 
[01:44:30]  Dugout Doug.  Dugout Doug sent me an IM.  I'll ban him.  I don't want to compete against a guy that goes to the parlor.  The parlor.  Dugout Doug says he's plugging us.  That's fucking great.  That's what we thrive on.  That's right.  The pests are getting plugs on Howard's show.  Well, let's see what this clip is all about.  I was insulted.  I'm reading one, you know, I'm ready to gloat, and I'm reading one article, and they have me  pictured up against Opie and Anthony.  I sit there, I want to vomit. 
[01:45:00]  I go, yeah, right.  What three people did they bring into that?  I was going to say, here we go.  Three people.  Three people again.  Three fucking people.  Hey, Howard.  That's at least seven, you asshole.  Hey, Howard, here's a little tidbit.  Jesus.  Here's a little tidbit that might interest you, Howard.  Little tidbit.  We have more listeners than you do.  That is a fact.  We have more listeners to this program, to the Opie and Anthony show, than you, the Howard 
[01:45:30]  Stern Radio Show.  You're lucky that your name is mentioned up against ours.  Right.  Because we have a bigger audience right now, you asshole.  It insults us.  It makes us sick.  We have more fucking listeners than you do.  And again, it's driving you crazy, isn't it?  Get the crazy songs ready, Derek.  Three people did they bring into that mix.  I was going to say, they did a lot for XM when they were signed.  If that's who I'm competing with, well, guess what?  Game over.  Yeah.  You're the one. 
[01:46:00]  Game over, all right.  Nobody cared that they went there.  The ONA.  No one cared that we went here, huh?  Yeah.  You're caring right now, Howard.  You care a fuckload, don't you, Howard?  This is today.  This is happening now.  This happened about a half hour ago.  You care.  USA Today cares.  Do you know there are people on the radio all over this country that bash Howard Stern  on a daily basis?  Does Howard ever mention them?  They are completely under his radar.  They don't make an effect on him, an impact.  They don't anger him.  This program, for fucking ten years, we have been under this guy's skin. 
[01:46:30]  For ten fucking years, in some way, shape, or form, we have been a splinter in this guy's  fucking ass, and he hates it and hates us for it.  And for ten years, he's been trying to get rid of us.  And we've been successful and continue to be successful and continue to just keep climbing.  That's right.  And the motherfucker is so pissed, because he does not know what the fuck to do about 
[01:47:00]  it, because no strategy he's used on anyone else to destroy.  Mark and Brian, DiBella, all the other fucking jocks he's taken down over the fucking years,  none of that has ever worked on this fucking show, and we've continued to chip away at you  and piss you the fuck off.  You know why?  Because I'm a black ninja.  I'm bobbing.  Hey, ho, ho.  Watch it.  Missing all the blows.  Ooh, that fucking star.  Almost hit me.  Karate. 
[01:47:30]  And Anthony's smart.  Yeah.  Say something smart, Ant.  We breathe air.  Attaboy.  See how happy we are today?  He has no idea.  Was this supposed to get under our skin?  You idiot.  Gonna have to try a little harder.  Yeah.  Look, nobody cared that they went there.  Nobody.  The ONA Army.  In fact, the funny thing about it is, they didn't know what to do after they got signed 
[01:48:00]  to XM to try to bring anybody there.  Well, they didn't.  Well, I swear to God, the next time I see Robin Quiver, an open-handed smack across her  fat face.  Nice.  Just comment on, if you see her in public, just comment on how fat her ass has gotten.  She loves that.  This hole.  Which, by the way, makes Howard's show feel old, by the way.  Yeah, the hole.  Howard, you don't need the hole anymore to say the racist shit.  You don't need the hole to have the naked girls in the studio. 
[01:48:30]  Back in the day, in the 80s, yes, it made sense to have some female presence in there  so you could get away with murder.  You don't need her anymore.  She adds nothing to your show.  Get rid of the hole.  You, Fred, and Artie will do a fine job.  There you go.  Get rid of the hole.  She says the same shit.  She goes, and they didn't know what to do when they came to Satellite Radio, Howard.  Our work speaks for itself.  Go to audible.com.  There's volumes and volumes of stuff up there that's being downloaded like crazy all over the fucking world. 
[01:49:00]  That's what we did.  That's our catalog of stuff since coming to Satellite Radio.  Listen for yourself, and you tell me if she's telling the truth or not.  Howie, how many people are you bringing in that never heard your show before?  How's that working out for you?  How many people are calling you up, writing you, and saying,  Man, you know, I never heard your show before, but a friend of mine turned me on to it,  and I'm listening.  That's called growth by word of mouth. 
[01:49:30]  I really don't see that happening with Howard.  You get the big initial, everyone that was listening, a small portion of them actually, signed up.  And then what happens, Howie?  Everyone knows who you are and what you do.  It's predictable.  There's no surprises out there.  So your subs, what are they doing?  Dropping off, Howard.  It's driving you crazy, isn't it?  That's a fact.  It is dropping off.  Dropping off.  He's great at the celebrity interview, but the celebrities don't want to be on the show  because he doesn't have a big enough audience. 
[01:50:00]  Hey, where do the A-listers go, Howard?  Not quite friends of yours as much as they were the 10 million listeners you allegedly had.  Oh, now there's quite a few less listeners, and maybe those A-listers ain't showing up as much.  Is that what's happening, Howie?  That's really what's getting you.  You're taking it out on us.  That's all right.  We'll be your punching bag for today.  Go ahead.  Let out a little steam.  We'll help.  We'll help you.  And listen to the hole that is Robin with info that is just completely false because she has nothing to add to this conversation. 
[01:50:30]  Nobody cared that they went there.  Yeah, of course.  The O&A Army.  In fact, the funny thing about it is they didn't know what to do after they got signed to XM to try to bring anybody there.  Because you hadn't done it before.  Because you hadn't done it before.  Oh, my God.  Take your slathering big fucking lips off his cock, you stupid fucking cunt.  Oh, my God.  So what do we do?  We just sat here and just.  Yeah.  This is what we did for. 
[01:51:00]  For 14 months.  This is what we did for a little over a year.  We just sat in the studio every morning, whistling to ourselves and twiddling our thumbs going,  Well, he'll be here soon.  Soon Howard will be here to tell us what to do.  So in the meantime, we'll look.  I'm twiddling.  Listen to people.  Please, I implore you.  Listen to what these people are saying.  Listen closely to what Howard and Robin are saying in this tirade and realize how insane this is driving them. 
[01:51:30]  Who comes up?  Who actually?  She actually just said, we came to Satellite, did nothing because Howard hadn't done it yet.  And Howard goes, that's right.  Holy shit.  So what did we do for over a year?  Just sat here and did what?  We put on a fucking entertaining show that has gotten subscribers to come to XM and to this program.  That's the fact of the matter, you dumb fucking cunt.  I don't, to be honest with you, I don't think Robin likes you guys. 
[01:52:00]  I'm getting that feeling.  I don't know.  Well, good, because we don't like her and neither does her own fucking staff.  They don't like you either.  Hole.  Their army.  Pharrell was all freaked out.  He got five of their, their five listeners, we called them.  All right.  All right.  Listen, Howard.  He's obsessed.  First of all, guys, I am, this is a very proud day for the army, for the pests.  Dude, you have, you have gotten so far under this guy's skin. 
[01:52:30]  He is obsessed with you guys now.  You're about to hear Howie Math once again.  Here's some Howie Math.  We all love Howie Math.  I have in front of me probably 10 CDs that are filled with ONA pest calls to the Scott Pharrell program.  Pal talk alone, this is fact.  These are numbers that were there.  It was over 1,300, 1,300 people.  And those were the fans just with webcams.  Right.  And someone was keeping track the first night, like Scott Pharrell took 50 phone calls and it was like 38 were from the pests or something like that. 
[01:53:00]  No, no.  50, 57 pests, three regular calls from Pharrell.  Okay, three regular calls.  But how he staged calls.  But you're about to hear Howie Math.  Howie Math.  That's a fact.  And if you listen to the program, you know, because we spend well over an hour just playing the pest phone calls.  Hey, that would be some five people if they could tie up his fucking phone lines for every show he did, every minute of every show he did. 
[01:53:30]  And this guy, he has such a huge ego.  He doesn't realize how out of touch he is.  He doesn't realize that it's not like 1990, what are we going to give him, 94-ish?  Yep.  He has no idea.  Where's the revolution, Howard?  He doesn't have the same fan power.  You don't have the fan base.  No, why?  Because you don't hang out with your fans.  When you do a rare public appearance, you got a million bodyguards around you and you got a roped off area that's well protected.  You're so out of touch with your own listeners. 
[01:54:00]  You have no connection with your own listeners.  When was the last time you fucking...  I'm not going to do shit for you, Howard, because you...  Wrote back to one.  You bailed on them years ago.  You bailed on them years ago.  Yep.  And they bailed on you.  Sure, you got your fucking lunatics out there.  You got a couple of lunatics out there.  That's it.  That isn't even big.  The widespread, like, lunatics that'll do anything for them.  Those days are so fucking long gone.  And, Howie, just shut your trap.  You don't want to piss off these guys. 
[01:54:30]  They've just begun.  They're out of our hands, man.  They've just begun, and at this point, you can't even play catch-up.  I challenge you.  You cannot do what the O&A Pests do.  You just can't.  You lost it a long time ago.  Didn't you?  Didn't you, Howie?  I'm to XM to try to bring anybody there.  Because you hadn't done it before.  Their army.  Even Howard is like, shut up.  They're five listeners who called them during the show and said,  Hey, you're a traitor.  You're on with Howard. 
[01:55:00]  I said, don't even react.  Who cares?  You're not being hurt.  See?  Ah, that's telling, isn't it?  Ah, that's telling.  He said, don't react.  Don't even react.  All Pharrell did was react to every fucking call.  And now Howard's reacting.  Which, what happened?  That must have pissed Howard off to no end.  What do I do?  They're fucking calling me.  I can't take a phone call.  I go, Pharrell, don't even react.  And every call, he fucking reacted. 
[01:55:30]  And Howard must have gotten pissed and said, pack your fucking bags.  During the show and said, hey, you're a traitor.  You're on with Howard.  I said, don't even react.  No, they said Frederica Pimmel.  Who cares?  Nobody heard.  Nobody listens to that.  Oh.  I didn't even know.  Yeah.  Someone like me didn't even know he was part of them.  I'm in the business.  The O&A Army.  But you know what's funny?  Army.  The O&A Army would have to buy Sirius in order to hear their pranks begin.  They're probably all subscribers. 
[01:56:00]  They have to.  The O&A Army.  There you go.  Sorry, Howie.  Sorry, Howie.  They were all listening for free because we set it up that way.  Sorry, Howie.  1,300 people were listening to one fucking internet feed that was bootlegged.  And that was being transmitted to all of those people for free.  You didn't see dime one of it, you fucking asshole.  And Howard once again lying because the lawyers got involved and a bunch of the pal talkers got.  Cease and desist.  Some C and Ds.  Which didn't stop them. 
[01:56:30]  They are still listening.  And he knows this as he's saying this and lying through his teeth once again.  This is all bullshit.  You would have to buy Sirius in order to hear their pranks begin.  They're probably all subscribers.  The O&A Army.  Army.  I mean, how gay?  An army of four.  They would show up at all my events.  I saw five signs.  Oh, my God.  Look, it's almost embarrassing to listen to this audio because, you know, we have done a lot of appearances ourselves.  And we've done quite well for ourselves. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Do the celebrity softball game.  Any of our road shows.  Yeah.  You go out on a stage and at times you see 2,000 people in front of you, right?  Yep.  There's no way you would ever just notice five people maybe holding Howard signs just to turn this whole thing around.  You're not going to notice.  The only time you would actually notice in that position that Howard was in as he's saying he's at these events is if there was a big, huge presence.  Enough people to make you notice.  Exactly. 
[01:57:30]  That's it.  Exactly.  And, Howard, if you think there's three or four people, again, I implore you, do another appearance.  Do another fucking appearance somewhere.  Please, please, please, please.  Please hit the streets somewhere because now they're all wound up in a froth the past.  Why don't you tell your listeners this little story?  When you decided to go down, where was it, Union Square, and we had a whole Mission Impossible thing that we were doing with walkie-talkies.  We rented rooms in the hotel overlooking the whole place that you were making your big appearance for Satellite Radio for the first time. 
[01:58:00]  We had hundreds and hundreds of ONA pests and fans with signs to wreck your fucking day.  Yeah.  We have pictures of you looking at the signs with a look on your face that can only be described as you wanted to kill somebody.  Why don't you tell your fans right now that you were planning on doing that in all the big cities, but after what happened that day, you bailed on that.  That is a fact.  You even talked about it on your commercial radio show that you would do the same thing in L.A., Philly, Washington, Boston. 
[01:58:30]  What happened to that little road trip, Howie?  What happened?  You couldn't control it.  You knew our listeners were going to show up wherever you went, so you bailed on that idea.  Why don't you tell your listeners that story today?  So full of shit.  I mean, you're four.  They would show up at all my events.  I saw five signs.  Five signs.  Sure you did.  Yeah, they were at the Letterman Appearance.  They were just following you around.  It's pathetic.  Hey, congrats, pests.  You were well noticed at the Letterman Appearance. 
[01:59:00]  And you're going to try to say there were five listeners at the Letterman Appearance when you showed up?  Yeah.  How about there were more Opie and Anthony fans there than Howard Stern fans?  Than there were Howard fans.  And the Howard fans are holding these little, handed out by serious people, eight by ten pieces of paper with Howard Stern printed on it.  And our fans had huge signs, banners, so that they had to crop pictures to put up on websites and news.  And we're not going to play the same game as Howard. 
[01:59:30]  You know, we're saying, we're telling you the truth here.  Yep.  But if you don't want to, if this party is like, ah, come on, are these guys like telling the truth?  Go to OpieandAnthony.com and check out the pictures of just the Letterman thing alone.  This is all researchable.  You can look and get the facts on all this stuff.  This guy is just losing his mind, and I love it.  They're just following you around.  It's pathetic.  Trying to let somebody know that they're, but why would you prank us?  We're not, it's not like radio anymore where everybody could possibly hear. 
[02:00:00]  They're already serious subscribers.  It's over, douchebags.  ONA, ONA's Cub Scout Troop.  They know, Army.  Where's the Army?  Cub Scout Troop?  You're the one wearing the Boy Scout uniform, you big faggot.  I forgot about that.  He's calling our Army Cub Scouts when he, one of the most embarrassing radio promotional  pictures I've ever seen in my life.  And radio guys will do the wacky promotional pictures.  Yep.  But Howie in a Boy Scout uniform?  Yeah, it was cute, Howie.  And you're going to tell our Army they're fucking Cub Scouts? 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  It's either you're wearing a Boy Scout uniform or you're wearing hip-hop clothes at 55 years  old.  Holy crap, you're, you're.  He's gone.  Man, he is fucking gone.  You're an embarrassment to yourself.  ONA's Cub Scout Troop ain't no Army.  Where's the Army?  What's the Army?  Let's get out the Army.  If you're going to get out an Army, you better have more than seven people in that Army.  Is that, ask Pharrell.  Ask Pharrell how many people. 
[02:01:00]  Ask your gem that you put on the air there, Pharrell.  Is that a bring it on, by the way?  Yeah, that sounded like a...  Did I hear a bring it on?  Bring it on.  Is it kind of challenging, the ONA pest?  Little challenge.  You could call...  He's saying Army a lot, and I know why.  It's a psychological thing.  He's trying to get under his skin because he knows there's a lot of radio shows out there  that have done the Army mentality.  Yeah.  Where you could get some dumb shirt that has ONA Army and it's fatigues and stuff.  Yeah, stop.  And then you get a number, but it means nothing. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  You get maybe a discount on a concert ticket or whatever.  Yeah, that's the lame Army.  So, Howie, I get it.  You're saying Army to try to get under our skin, but we already know that this is way  past that, and they're pests.  They're pests.  No one has ever explained it in this way in radio before.  Yeah.  We have ONA pests.  They know how to get to people.  They've gotten to you.  Let me back it up.  Did he actually say, bring it on here, Ed?  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's get out the Army.  If you're going to get out an Army, you better have more than seven people in that Army.  Well, if their only ammunition was Opie and Anthony, I thought it was rather pathetic 
[02:02:00]  that all they could do was follow us around and hold up signs at your rallies.  Well, no, Rob, and that's not all the pests have done.  Because you're the douchebags.  Dujour.  You're the ones that we're targeting at that time, you idiot.  Right.  The pests have done many, many things that had nothing to do with Howard Stern and the  hole.  And the hole.  But in their world, it's all about them.  The entire universe revolves around Howie's head, so they can't see past that. 
[02:02:30]  No, the pests have been involved in many, many other things that had nothing to do with  you guys.  There was a little campaign called the Assault on the Media that was quite, quite successful.  Yeah, I remember that.  That was another thing the pest took on.  And hold up signs at your rallies.  Well, I mean, it's not even...  Come on, Rob, and that's a good, solid idea.  It's like, that's the arrogance of XM.  Don't pit me up against those two jerks.  Put me up against your whole company.  I told you that when we sat and talked. 
[02:03:00]  One company's going to win.  Yep, yep, you got that right.  One company.  How stupid is it?  You got a group full of people who've stood around in the rain to listen to Howard Stern  and you hold up an ONA sign.  It was just pathetic.  Like, that's going to convince somebody to buy XM.  Make you proud.  No, no, no, that wasn't the goal there.  Excuse me.  Hole.  That was not the mission or the goal was to get people to convert to XM. 
[02:03:30]  It was to annoy the shit out of an out-of-touch old fucking doddering fool and a kiss-ass fucking cunt hole.  And, uh, mission accomplished.  And have...  You're babbling about it for fucking 20 minutes.  And have them talk about XM and Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  There you go.  Which makes it bigger in the end.  Howard, you know this game.  Yeah.  You know this game.  Good job.  Good job.  Thank you.  Just keep saying Opie and Anthony and XM.  That's it.  It was just pathetic.  Like, that's going to convince somebody to buy XM. 
[02:04:00]  Make your product good.  We have been.  Don't sit around and follow me around in all my appearances.  It's gay.  It's lame.  I feel bad for them.  See, he's saying all this because he really wants us to stop.  Yeah.  He really...  I should be a psychologist.  This is...  Please, please stop.  I should have a second career.  I'm telling you.  I know this shit.  Yeah.  I know this shit like the back of my hand.  I'm going to open up a practice here in Manhattan.  Oh, I know I'm nuts.  But the reason I'm nuts is because I understand all this shit. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  He wants us to stop.  That's why he's bringing this up today.  And he thinks he'll get to us like, guys, this is really lame.  We don't think it's lame, Howard.  How about that?  How about them apples?  He saw what we did to Pharrell.  He saw that.  He knows that in order to build his channel, he's going to have to get the next guy.  That comes in and does a show.  And he knows the potential of what can happen to the next guy and the guy after that and the guy after that. 
[02:05:00]  And this is this is a cry for help.  Please stop.  And he doesn't have bosses to shut us up anymore.  Nope.  You can't run.  And that's got to be driving him nuts.  You never would have heard this in the old days, by the way.  And this shit was happening all the fucking time.  This speech that he's giving right now on the air would have been done behind a door with the name Mel Karmazin written on it.  And we would have gotten a phone call and a threat to be fired.  Now, there's no boss you can call, is there, Howie? 
[02:05:30]  No boss.  No flick of your finger to get us thrown off the air.  Fuck you.  And when did the lawyers come to you?  Maybe yesterday, maybe over the weekend.  Yeah.  And they basically said, look, we did the research on the ONA pest thing and there's nothing we can do.  Nothing we can do about it.  When did they tell you that?  Yeah.  When did they tell you that?  And it just drove you nuts that you had to go on your show and talk about it today, hoping there's another way you could stop this.  Because for once, the lawyers couldn't help you.  Right, Howard? 
[02:06:00]  I love this.  See, we're smarter than we used to be.  Oh, I love this.  We're more intelligent than we used to be.  We do our research.  We work at this.  Don't sit around and follow me around at all my appearances.  It's gay.  It's lame.  I felt bad for them.  I know.  It was rather pitiful.  I was like, geez, that's all they've got?  Yeah.  That's all we got.  No offense to their army, but if people have a choice, go one way or the other, they're going to go with me. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, that's just the way it is.  It's the way it's always been and the way it always will be.  Well, we'll take that challenge, Howie.  Yeah.  Challenge on, because we have more listeners.  Come over to Sirius.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Because that's the future.  Look at him begging.  I do believe it.  He's begging.  I really believe it.  I believe this company's got some momentum.  Call me nuts.  Okay.  You know.  Game fucking on.  Listen to him begging.  Come over to Sirius.  Game fucking on.  Hey, pests.  We'll take that challenge, Howie.  We have more listeners than you. 
[02:07:00]  We'll continue to have more listeners than you, Howard.  And that bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it?  And it's true.  It's going to end up with this being a one company thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's going to be the company that is more financially sound than the other.  The one that's more responsible.  We're more than ready to take you on, Howard.  And you know that.  You know that.  We've been waiting for this day.  We've been waiting for the day where the bosses don't shut us up anymore.  You can't play your stupid games behind closed doors and then go on the radio and act like you take on all comers. 
[02:07:30]  All newcomers, all newcomers, the old, the new.  You take on everybody.  Everyone.  You were the greatest thing in radio.  You took on everybody, right?  But your listeners didn't know what was going on behind closed doors.  We shut up people with lawyers.  That's the shit we had to deal with.  And Mel Karmazin.  That's the shit we had to deal with.  And that's why sometimes people ask, why you got a problem with the Howard?  Why do you talk about him?  Because we went so many years where we couldn't because that speech you just heard was delivered  to our fucking boss, the head of Infinity Broadcasting.  And it came down to us that we were to shut up and not talk about Howard, no matter what 
[02:08:00]  he said about us, calling us clones and ripoffs.  And then we couldn't answer back or we would have been fired.  Now, game on.  Game fucking on.  Bring it.  You, your fucking hole, the pests.  And by the way.  Oh, is he obsessed with the pests?  Yeah, they know.  Oh, pest job well done.  He is obsessed with you now.  Bunch of nudges.  Oh, you, you, ugh.  Know why?  Because he was too busy for the last, who knows, 10 years living the high life. 
[02:08:30]  Doing subpar radio.  Doing subpar radio.  His own words.  And just allowed us to sit there and just build this thing that's called the Opie and  Anthony program.  To build this, uh, you want to call an army, Howie, fine.  To build this pest mentality.  And you're obsessed by it because you're like, fuck, that's a great idea, but that takes  years to develop.  And I didn't have the time because I was too busy jumping in a helicopter and going out  to the Hamptons to hang out with the rich and famous.  Yep.  You've lost touch with your audience and now it's too late to play catch up. 
[02:09:00]  It's way fucking too late.  And you know it.  Game fucking on, Howard.  Game on.  And every article will mention Opie and Anthony alongside your name.  They've been doing that for well over a year now.  Yeah.  And it finally got to you.  And I'm glad you're finally, you know, taking on the battle because we didn't want to be  bothered with Bubba the Love Sponge and Scott Farrell and the rest of these asses that used  to fight the same battle as Anthony and I.  The slim pickings that you had to choose from to try to fill two channels, uh, 24 hours a 
[02:09:30]  day.  Slim pickings, ain't it, Howie?  I love it.  I love it, baby.  Come on.  Give me the theme song.  Let's get going.  What are you loving so much?  What am I loving?  I'm loving this, uh, while we were gone, all this, uh, XM's board of director guy freaking  out and leaving.  And, uh, I got a whole, I mean, man, I got tons of articles about it.  I just want to talk about it. 
[02:10:00]  I want to gloat a little today.  Maybe I want to get rid of that guy, by the way.  Bye-bye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You want to be like Robert De Niro in Cape Fear?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  That's right.  And instead of problem child, it's XM.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I saw, you know, I'm, I'm Mr. Stock Guy now.  I get the New York Times business section, because I want to look cool for the chicks. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that'll turn them on.  I saw XM drop two and a half bucks.  Well, you know, when I met...  That is big. That's a lot.  Oh, my God. What about Sirius' stock?  Sirius' stock is way the fuck down, too.  What happened is...  Right now, the whole sector is down.  Everyone knows that.  They were commenting on the bad quarter that XM had,  and they were gloating.  And the very next day, Sirius came out with their quarterly result.  Perhaps they should have waited. 
[02:11:00]  And saw how Sirius did before they did their gloating,  because Sirius was in worse shape as far as their quarter went.  And Howard hasn't even moved the stock.  No.  No, Howie, what happened?  Howard hasn't even moved the stock.  It's almost at a 52-week low as well.  What happened?  What happened to the people that bought in at nine?  Oh, what happened?  You haven't even moved the stock.  And gloating is in very poor taste,  because if Sirius had a bad quarter or whatever,  nobody on this program would gloat.  Of course not. 
[02:11:30]  We would be going, better luck next time, guys.  Keep your chins up.  Gee, what can we help?  But the point Anthony makes here is that both companies had very bad fourth quarter reports.  These companies, in a lot of ways, especially with Wall Street, run in parity with each other.  If one company does something good, you'll notice the other company also goes up.  It's called a sector.  There's only two companies in this sector. 
[02:12:00]  But a lot of times, one company can have no news at all.  Another has good news.  Both go up.  One company has bad news.  The other company has no news.  Both go down.  Sometimes they split.  But if you look at a graph of both companies over the past couple of years,  they really do follow each other percentage-wise as far as how their stock goes up and down.  Right.  It's just the way it is.  So if you're gloating about anything with our stock going down, yours is dropping at the same time. 
[02:12:30]  It just happens.  It's called Wall Street.  If a stock just kept going up, please, let me buy it.  A little message to Doug OutDoug.  Yeah.  Have the boys push the button.  Have the boys push the button.  Just show just a little power.  Have the boys push the button.  What does that mean?  Here's the word.  Have the boys push the button.  All four boys.  All four boys.  We want all four boys. 
[02:13:00]  They must have big, huge, meaty fingers because four boys have a lot of power.  Doug, yes, push the button.  Thank you.  When I met with those guys up in my apartment not too long ago, I don't know, year and a half,  I don't know, I've lost track of time, two years, whatever it was,  I said to them, you could put away this whole baby.  You could push the button.  Push the button.  I don't like when you yell. 
[02:13:30]  This is your puppet master.  Push the button.  Push the button.  Push it.  For the love of God, push the button.  I don't like the devil.  Wow.  That was the devil, not the black engine, by the way.  I don't like the devil.  Push the fucking button.  There you go. 
[02:14:00]  You want it.  You got it.  Push the fucking button.  Let's see how four listeners, four listeners can tie up your fucking phone lines for the whole show, Howie.  Very serious.  Right.  I'm telling you right now.  I said, I got the plan.  I know what I need to do.  You guys do what you've been doing and let me do my thing.  By the way, he has no plan.  And I saw the look of the room.  The plan is re-recording old bits.  I saw, I saw, they all sat there like big puds. 
[02:14:30]  They didn't jump up and run to the phone?  No.  Nothing.  They kept going, what do we do next?  What do we do next?  What?  What do we do next?  What?  I said, listen, satellite could be your future.  And they looked at me with this arrogance because XM was, oh, you know, no one cares about Sirius.  They only have 600,000 subscribers.  Don't worry.  We're going to win.  We have superior this, superior people.  Oh, what do you know?  Oh, they gave me answers and pie charts and graphs about what they were going to do. 
[02:15:00]  And I said, listen, shit or get off the pot.  Well, you saw the newspaper.  The report, Sirius Satellite's subscriber base increased by almost 200% in 2005.  To boil it down, here's what happened in a nutshell.  Well, when you start off with not many subscribers, yeah, that's a very easy thing to do, Howard.  When you talk percents.  Yes, you had an influence on that whole thing.  Of course, you're Howard Stern.  You better have had an influence.  But this is a very long race. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Everyone knew you were going to do just well for the company in the fourth quarter and possibly part of the first quarter this year.  Yeah.  After that, then it does come down to the car deals and what else each service has to offer.  Portable units.  Technology.  It's not all about you.  Howard seems to think it's just about Howard.  Whoever gets Howard wins.  That isn't the case.  Mr. Half a Billion fucking dollars that now has to be paid.  That isn't the case.  It's not about whoever gets Howard wins. 
[02:16:00]  You pompous, fucking arrogant, conceited dick.  It's a company.  Whoever runs it better wins.  And yours is running it like shit.  Yeah.  You got to run it well from top to bottom.  You're a little responsible.  I would love for XM to come to us and say the whole company is about Opie and Anthony.  Of course.  Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?  We all have egos.  Of course that would be great.  But that's just...  Bad for the company.  But you know what?  As I'm collecting this massive paycheck, I'm throwing myself in Howard's shoes. 
[02:16:30]  I would be panicking behind the scenes going, how many of these checks am I going to be able  to collect before the whole thing collapses?  Because they're just concentrating on one fucking thing.  I'm an under the radar kind of guy.  I don't care where Howard is or where Opie and Anthony are.  I just don't want the devil to show up again.  Scared me.  You know the difference between the two, right?  Black Ninja and the devil?  Yes.  Okay, good.  ...released by almost 200% in 2005.  To boil it down, here's what happened in a nutshell. 
[02:17:00]  XM freaking out.  Freaking out.  The board of director guy is right.  XM starts freaking out.  Yeah, the one guy.  And they decide to combat me.  You know what?  I'm sorry we're spending so much time here, but we have to.  Yeah.  This is a very important thing.  You know, we're not going to allow Howard to walk all over us or the company and spew  his bullshit.  Okay?  Let's logically look at this.  If the board of director, yes, we had one quit. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  And he said some dumb things.  He probably will never be on a board of director...  Board of directors.  Board of directors for another company because he blew up his spot.  Now, if what this guy was saying was the truth, don't you think everyone would have  followed him out the door or at least a few other people?  Harumph.  He was the only one.  He left and they all said, all right, so long.  That's what you think.  Not one other person said, you know what?  That guy makes sense.  Why is that, Howard?  To combat me. 
[02:18:00]  That would be a real crisis.  It's always about him.  To combat me.  And they decide to combat me and my move to satellite, to Syria satellite, they spent  $196.5 million on advertising that went nowhere.  It wasn't $196 million.  But this is Howie math, so...  More Howie math.  You know, you've got to accept him at this point for this Howie math.  It was, well, they probably don't want us to give up the number.  And it went nowhere?  I could tell you this, it was way less than that. 
[02:18:30]  And it went nowhere, by the way?  Really?  No one bought XM satellite radio?  We made our number.  We made the number.  We did what we had to do.  Made the projection.  That's right.  Advertising that went nowhere.  Nobody cared.  First of all, the ads were bogus.  Number one, nicely produced ad, but a bunch of crap.  What you saw in that ad is what actually goes on here at Sirius.  I'll give you an example.  Oh, my God.  In XM's ad, you saw Ellen DeGeneres hanging out at the studio slapping on headphones while Snoop Doggy Dog passes her in the hall. 
[02:19:00]  And David Bowie's in another studio.  And David Bowie's in another studio.  Yeah, because that's every morning there.  Yeah, lies.  Let me tell you what happens here.  That does happen every day.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dog on a daily basis.  And we eat pussy with Ellen.  That's right.  Ellen, pass the pussy.  I need some. 
[02:19:30]  That's what we do.  The guy doesn't seem to understand.  Right next to the Starbucks machine is fresh pussy.  And we eat chicken with Oprah.  Does somebody have to explain a figurative ad to Howard?  Does someone really have to explain a figurative ad to the man?  Remember yesterday we all put on fat suits with Tyra Banks?  Right.  That's right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  He's...  I'm still wearing the bling bling that Snoop gave me.  That's right.  Because we're pals.  Dude.  Dude, he's going crazy.  And sometimes we'll all lay in some dirt from our home country with Bob Edwards.  That fucking ghoul.  We all lay on satin pillows with Bob.  I don't know how many nights I've spent hanging from my feet.  That's right.  Sometimes we all turn into bats and fly around the studio with Bob Edwards. 
[02:20:30]  I wish he'd come into the studio, but he has to be invited in.  Someone take that garlic off the windowsill.  Food!  Food!  All right!  And one thing I do want to point out, we're still having a lot of fun on a daily basis here.  That's the difference.  You could hear the stress and pressure in his voice.  It's all about fun over here at the end of the day.  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:00]  He's losing his mind.  We used to get in so much trouble at the old place for just having fun.  That used to blow my mind.  Meetings with people that looked at us like they were our fathers, yelling and screaming at us.  Like, we, you know, blew off curfew and actually blew off even coming home for a week.  Yeah.  I'm like, we were just doing radio and making people laugh.  What's the big fucking deal?  Well, the big fucking deal is you made fun of Howard, and he doesn't appreciate that.  Blah, blah, blah.  His fucking ego is out of control.  And please, please, could you please stop?  Because it's driving me nuts and making my life a living hell. 
[02:21:30]  But we're just making people laugh.  Let me tell you what happens here.  Like Gary said, he goes, you're here all the time.  You see, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart's here at least two to three times a week.  You run into her.  Wow.  You see, wow, that's got to be great.  That must be an exciting little conversation.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Martha.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sitting down with Martha, are you, Howie?  Yeah.  Robert Plant wasn't just hanging out with the staff down in Washington.  You want to play this game, Howard? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Robert Plant didn't come down there for an artist confidential and just hang out, playing his songs  for a small audience, then signing autographs, taking pictures with everybody.  Couldn't have been nicer.  Same thing happened with Paul McCartney.  Let's play that game, Howard.  Who?  Paul McCartney.  Never heard of him.  What do you say to Martha when you see her?  So, you're over 50, your show failed, and your daughter's a twat.  What can I get you for breakfast?  I hear that daughter's a real C word on wheels.  That's just what the word on the street is. 
[02:22:30]  The word on the street has it.  On any given day, you know, the main facility is in Washington, although they're building  this Lincoln Center facility here in New York is getting bigger and bigger.  Obviously, they just moved out everyone from this area to go over there, and people are  walking through those halls and down in Washington every day, too.  Yeah.  Every day.  You see a senator, then you see John Riggins, and you see everybody hanging out and doing  that.  Holy shit.  He said he sees Martha.  Martha.  Martha.  That's my Long Island accent. 
[02:23:00]  I get excited.  All right, whatever.  Now, now, don't beat yourself up.  Martha Stewart.  Yeah.  A senator.  Ooh.  I want to see if he's onto something here.  A senator.  Uh-huh.  Which senator, by the way?  And John Riggins.  Ooh.  We see Than.  That's right.  Call our agent.  Derek.  We need to work over there.  And Travis.  And we see Hawk.  Hawk is here on a daily basis.  Steve C.  Rolling around in foliage, doing nothing. 
[02:23:30]  Master Poe, opening the door like it's a fucking, it's a ninja studio.  That fucking sociopath.  We see Mars running around aimlessly, pointing at the phones, going, and running back out like  a fucking kook.  We see Ben herkying and jerking, like fucking a 1912 movie.  Nosferatu.  Bah!  Who needs Martha?  You see John Riggins, and you see everybody hanging out and doing that. 
[02:24:00]  What was in the XM commercial actually goes on here at Sirius.  The reason.  He just, okay.  I hate to keep stopping, because he's talking about the XM commercial that got a lot of play  to the point he knew all about XM.  He noticed it.  So in the XM commercial, we had David Bowie, Ellen DeGeneres, and Snoop Dogg, right?  Those are three huge names in entertainment.  He compared Martha Stewart, a senator, and John Riggins to those three people.  That's what he's doing in this.  And you know what I forgot to mention, the biggest of all, is we see all these people, 
[02:24:30]  but more importantly, we see Danny and Derek's balls.  That's true.  And that's why we're better.  Bigger celebrities.  That's right.  We don't need to name drop.  That's right.  We don't care about Martha Stewart.  We have big young man balls.  We have Derek's ball bag.  We certainly do.  He's just a few drinks away from hammering in his own butt plug.  That fucking mess of a ball bag he's got.  Jesus.  That's fucking great.  He's got the haircut of Eric Logan and the balls of a 90-year-old. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Who knew?  Oh, damn thing is stuck to the side of his leg as we speak.  Get in here, son.  Tuck those balls into your socks.  Yeah.  I guess he's, did he announce his decision that he's only doing four days a week?  I don't know.  That he's not doing Friday?  Because apparently Doug has this whole thing that his fans are very upset about this.  All of his message.  Well, that's how much passion he's got.  Yeah.  Not only is he taking the money and running, something XM wasn't willing to do, 
[02:25:30]  he's only going to do four days a week.  That was supposed to happen right off the bat.  But the company is in such a shaky position here that I heard, and now this is, I'm going  on speculation, okay?  I really am.  At least you admit that.  But I heard through some pretty reliable sources that they had a nice meeting and said,  look, can you help us out here and do five days a week for a while until we get on steady  ground?  And then you'll do the four days a week that's in your contract.  Not counting the three months a year he's going to take off for vacation, by the way. 
[02:26:00]  Here's the difference between the two shows.  We, of course, both shows want the companies that we're with to succeed and do well.  That's a given.  The way we approach it, and have approached it from the beginning, is if we put on a quality  show that people want to listen to on a daily basis, the rest takes care of itself.  People will subscribe because of that.  They'll tell their friends about it who will subscribe, and our audience will build by us 
[02:26:30]  doing a show like that.  Howard seems to think that by pitching and selling and being a fucking salesman, that  that's going to do it.  That getting on and just talking about how great he is and how great Sirius is, without  putting on an entertaining program and having a passionate fan base that you can relate to,  that that's going to get the subs in.  What do you think works? 
[02:27:00]  What do you think works?  We've seen a lot of growth.  I see over there an old guy begging, begging for fucking subscribers.  Good luck with that strategy.  You don't give a shit anymore.  You did at one point.  I was a fan when you did.  You gave a shit about radio.  It was fun.  Now it's about how much money can I get, how many days off can I take.  By the way, Howard, we're going to be doing a live broadcast, St. Paddy's Day.  Yeah.  You're more than welcome to show up.  Come on in.  We'll show you how it is to hang out with your fans and give a shit. 
[02:27:30]  And have a good time.  When was the last time you just did something where you just hung out with the fans?  Yeah.  And it wasn't all about you retiring from regular radio and this and that.  When was it?  It's not climbing up on a double-decker bus and driving past your fans, leaving them  in a plume of exhaust.  Right.  With ten bodyguards just in case.  Yeah.  Because everyone wants to get to Howie.  That's how he handles it.  You fucking freak.  Do you just sit in your fucking house and replay the book signing video, Howard? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Let me...  From years ago where there were thousands of people around.  Do you fucking replay that and go, hmm, those were the days.  The glory days.  The glory days of the Stern Show.  Like, what do you have planned for your listeners in the near future?  Well, I could tell you what we have planned, okay?  We're doing an impromptu O&A pest late-night karaoke thing in my brother's restaurant in  Huntington.  That's nothing to even do with the radio show.  Yeah.  Just a bunch of us hanging out doing karaoke.  Oh, what?  There won't be thousands of people there, potential subscribers to cash in on? 
[02:28:30]  Well, then we shouldn't do it.  And guess what?  Just hanging out with a couple of hundred of our fans and having a good time is pathetic.  And there will be no cover charge, by the way.  Because if you did do something like that, you'd probably charge them for everything.  Of course.  You'd probably rent the microphone as they're getting up to fucking sing their stupid, you  know, Charlie Daniels song.  Or all that she wants is another baby.  What day are we doing the karaoke, by the way?  Two weeks from...  Hold on.  It's in the old phone. 
[02:29:00]  FH Riley's.  My brother's restaurant's a great place.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington.  And just for the hell of it, we're doing late night karaoke with the O&A Pass.  I, I, I, you know this, I'm trying to get to this, but I lost my stylus.  That's only one event we're doing in the next month and a half or so.  Then we're going to be broadcasting live from the Hard Rock Cafe, St. Paddy's Day.  I think it's March 4th would be two weeks from...  This past Saturday?  I believe so, yeah.  Saturday was what, the 18th?  Yeah, it's going to be Saturday night, late night.  Around 11 o'clock, we're going to start up the late night karaoke at my brother's restaurant. 
[02:29:30]  St. Paddy's Day party.  Then we got the St. Paddy's Day party at the Hard Rock Cafe, broadcasting live.  We're bringing the Pal Talk to both of those gigs, by the way, so the rest of the country  could see it, okay?  We don't get a dime for Pal Talk, by the way.  We just know it enhances the show and it's a great thing to do.  And then finally, I think we're doing opening day in Boston.  That's three events we're doing in just the next month and a half alone.  What are you doing for your fans, Howard?  What are you doing, really?  Besides taping old bits like Jackie Martling never existed, throwing Artie in doing Jackie's 
[02:30:00]  parts in the old bits, and rebroadcasting them.  Cutting edge, dude.  They're the revolutions on, man.  Yeah.  Let freedom ring and let it be rung by a stripper.  Wow.  You're so fucking cool.  Ugh.  He's supposed to be so original, and then he just steals the black power fucking symbol.  Yeah.  That's real original.  Yeah, what, you were going to make believe no one? 
[02:30:30]  You just assumed no one was going to remember the black power fist?  Howie power, Opie.  He goes on here at Sirius.  The reason...  And they just took on Oprah, who'll never appear in their halls either.  Right, but she'll be on the commercial.  The reason XM's commercials are lying is none of those people actually do anything.  They don't go to any place and all hang out together.  There's no common meeting space.  I mean, let's call a spade a spade.  Ellen DeGeneres.  Hey, now signing Oprah was one thing.  She's not doing anything.  She ain't slapping on any headphones.  That kind of talk. 
[02:31:00]  Only she's slapping on.  It's a pair of women's thighs over her mouth.  Well, of course, she doesn't have a home, but that doesn't matter.  Well, hey, that's the truth.  So, all of a sudden, they spent $196.5 million on commercials that didn't make a difference.  Didn't make a difference.  They should have taken that money and spent it on talent.  Is that what they spent on those commercials?  $196.5.  XM's expenses included a $196.5 million marketing list. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Holy shit.  Then they came up with the money.  They started to panic in the fourth quarter.  Then they signed Oprah, who's going to be on a half hour a week, to the worst radio deal  in the history of radio.  Well, I think the worst one is you for a half a billion dollars.  A washed up fucking radio guy for a half a billion dollars.  Probably a worse deal, I think.  Or Oprah that talks to 27 million people on her show.  Yeah.  And plugs XM on her show. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, that's a real bad deal.  Well, Jesus Christ.  In the history of radio, and this board of directors guy said, I have enough.  Now, you could imagine, if he's on the board of directors, he must own a piece of the company.  For him to resign like that means he must be really pissed.  You think, Howard?  XM was the leader.  And now they're floundering. 
[02:32:30]  You know what's going on at car dealerships?  I just got a letter from my friend Wayne Siegel, who sells all kinds of different cars.  His friend is a car dealer.  And he says to me, he hasn't moved any XM product in months.  Ah, shut the fuck up!  What a lying sack of shit.  If you've got a choice, you're going to come here.  I just love it.  I just love.  Wow.  I just love it.  I love that Sirius is doing so well.  Yeah, you keep telling yourself that. 
[02:33:00]  Because I think back to those meetings.  Keep telling yourself.  I had two meetings with Sirius, and they made me a deal.  Maybe it was me, too.  That was all it took.  That's all he cared about.  We know what we have to do.  They had no fucking choice.  We understand who you are.  We understand your audience.  Your audience is loyal to you.  And you guys have been loyal to us.  And that's it.  Sirius Satellite's subscriber base increased by almost 200% in 2005.  Yeah, if you had four, and you got eight, or 16, or 12. 
[02:33:30]  It would be 12.  I love percentages.  You're not good with math.  If you had four, and then you have 12.  Right.  Is that good?  That would be 200%.  That's 200%.  When you hear people talking in percentages, they're covering something up.  They're covering up some real numbers.  Always.  That's like saying I went out with, I fuck a girl that I went on a date with, and that's  the only girl I ever went on a date with, and I can say, I fucked 100% of the girls  I've dated.  Right.  Right.  That's Howie math.  Percentages.  Howie will throw those in. 
[02:34:00]  I got to hand it to him.  He's good at Howie math.  Very good at Howie math.  You keep telling yourself your company's doing great.  But here it is.  Keep telling yourself.  Here it is.  Even with the massive push that Howard gave that company, yesterday, we don't even,  this is the latest article that came out, unless something came out today, I don't  know.  It's USA Today, okay?  2005 subscribers.  According to USA Today yesterday, XM, 5.9 million subscribers.  Sirius, 3.3. 
[02:34:30]  There you go.  And that was after the huge Howie push.  Yeah.  They're not going to get the huge Howie push for the rest of time here.  And for him to say the advertising did nothing when the projected numbers were reached, the  projected numbers were reached.  XM got the number of subscribers that they were looking for, that they predicted they would  get.  It happened.  Where was your giant impact that was supposed to take away from XM? 
[02:35:00]  Where were the cars that he hasn't sold that his friend, his car dealer friend, that's  another guy, Howard.  Please, Howie, realize this.  It's sad to listen to.  All of your friends, and I'm doing the quotation mark with my fingers, all of your friends are  just guys sucking your cock because you're Howard Stern.  That's it.  They're going to kiss your ass.  Holy shit.  Is that true, Derek?  How do you guys know this?  Just get on mic.  We were just checking it online. 
[02:35:30]  What's up?  See, because we do our research here.  We don't just babble.  We try to give you guys facts.  But we do add in babble also.  What was Howard's friend's name?  What was it?  Again, it was...  What was his friend's name that he was talking to that was selling...  Wayne Siegel.  Wayne Siegel.  Who hasn't sold an XM product in months or something like that?  Months, yeah, that's what he said.  Yeah.  All right, Derek, what is the info you found that anyone can find by just, like, Googling  a little bit?  This is quick research.  He's a used Nissan car salesman. 
[02:36:00]  I don't even think XM has a deal with Nissan.  I don't think so either.  I don't know.  So that would probably mean that, yes...  And he's selling 10-year-old cars, probably, so it's a used Nissan salesman.  Yes.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Well, what do you mean?  XM is not going to be in that 88 Nissan I have my eyes on?  Well, then, fuck us.  We're done for.  Good research.  Guys, this is the babbling bullshit this doddering old fuck is sputtering out of his 
[02:36:30]  mouth on a daily basis.  He's desperate.  It's obvious.  We sit here laughing, having a good time, even with this whole thing.  It's funny to us because the company is doing well.  We know XM's doing well.  We talk to the brass of the company.  We find out what's going on.  We know it's doing well.  We're excited about the technology that's coming out, the portable unit that's coming  out.  It's amazing. 
[02:37:00]  And they don't stop doing this.  It's growing by the day, this company.  Over there, everything is banked on Howard fucking Stern, and it just ain't working.  I'm sorry.  He had a push around Christmas time.  He had 14 months to promote the fact that he was going there.  And now, dropping off a bit, isn't it?  And you're desperate and a little scared.  2005 ad revenue, XM, 20.1 million, Sirius, 6.1. 
[02:37:30]  Nissan.  Use Nissan dealer.  You fucking liar.  This is a number that now we're getting too technical as far as this business goes.  Cost to acquire a new subscriber in 2005, okay?  It costs the company money to sign up a subscriber.  Yeah.  Well, as a growing company, eventually they'll turn the corner, they call it.  You got to throw the salaries in, the advertising, the marketing, the research for new products. 
[02:38:00]  All that costs money.  And then you turn around and you figure out how much it's costing the company per new subscriber.  It costs, yeah, a certain dollar amount to get one subscriber.  Right now, it's costing both companies money to get subscribers.  To get a subscriber, right.  I hope people understand that, okay?  In 2005, it cost XM $64 per new subscriber.  So, XM, it costs XM $64 to get every new subscriber.  Right.  Sirius, 139. 
[02:38:30]  This is 139.  What, are they taking each one to dinner?  What the fuck are they doing over there?  These are the numbers that scares the shit out of Wall Street, by the way.  Yep, that number's way too fucking high.  Way too fucking high.  And that number, by the way, will probably be higher in 2006 because of the signing of Howard.  Because of Howard.  It'll be much higher than that, probably.  You're adding a half a billion dollars to that.  Jesus Christ.  And that's what scares the shit out of Wall Street, by the way.  And Howard.  By the way.  And it scares Howard.  One of the many numbers. 
[02:39:00]  100% in 2005.  Ending the year with 3.3 million subscribers.  XM 5.9.  Nah.  Ha ha.  XM pioneered satellite radio in 2001, but has been steadily overtaken in the last five  years by Sirius, which opened up shop in late 2002.  What?  That's not true, by the way.  One key question for media planners and buyers is blah, blah, blah, whether to accept advertising,  offset costs, blah, blah, you know, who cares about all that.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, who cares, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, because that's the stuff that makes it better, you asshole. 
[02:39:30]  I tell you, I was so...  I want to go on a gloating tour.  I even called Dan Clora as my publicity guy, for lack of a better word.  I've never really had much need for publicity.  Does he work at Produce down at the Super Pocket?  Dan, I called him up.  I said, book me on a few shows.  I want to go gloat.  I really do.  I love it.  Yeah, but then...  Bunch of guys all at XM standing around pulling their puds when I'm trying to talk sense to  them.  Talk sense.  No.  Listen to this fucking...  I would sit in a meeting with these guys. 
[02:40:00]  I would...  Pompous ass.  He is so...  I mean, if you're a regular listener of this show, we've played a lot of Howard Audio where  he talks about this great meeting he had at his apartment at 67th Street in Columbus  across from Starbucks on, I think, like the 50-something floor.  It's a beautiful building.  I'm thinking of getting a place in there myself.  That is nice.  Just to be under his skin.  Well, that would ruin him in the elevator every morning.  Howdy.  I saw...  How you doing?  I saw a great place recently, and it's not too far-fetched. 
[02:40:30]  Ah.  Take the elevator down in the morning together, Howie.  That'd be fun.  Anyway...  That'd be awkward, Hope.  This guy just listened to this audio over and over again about this meeting and how XM  wouldn't sign him.  He's obsessed and cannot believe...  That they didn't sign him.  That they blew him off.  They can't believe...  He wanted to go to XM.  I'm telling you, in the end, Howard is a very good businessman.  Yeah.  But he got the ego in the way and the amount of money in the way, and that's what's going  to fuck him in the end.  He knows business, and he knows XM was in much better shape to sign him. 
[02:41:00]  Instead of...  And they didn't want to.  No.  The numbers didn't work out for the company.  That's all.  Didn't work out.  So instead of saying, XM didn't think I was worth a half a billion dollars, he's saying,  they're so stupid over there for not signing me.  You're not worth a half a billion dollars.  You...  The desperate company, the one that is floundering, Sirius, was desperate.  That's why they gave you anything you asked for. 
[02:41:30]  You had them.  You had them over a barrel.  And now they're fucking paying for it.  Talk sense to them.  I would sit in a meeting with these guys.  I would go, man, we got to do college tours.  We're going to go out.  We're going to preach the gospel.  We got to set the world on fire and let them know how great our product is.  And they would look at me like...  I sit there and go...  Yeah, when you said how much you wanted.  I'd do the same thing.  How much do you want? 
[02:42:00]  A half a billion dollars.  Get the fuck out.  Exactly.  And did you hear them?  We'll go on college tours.  We'll do this.  We'll do that.  Well, now you're on satellite radio.  You're not doing any of that shit.  Maybe XM realized that you were full of shit and just talking out your ass.  Yeah.  Where are the college tours, Howie?  Too busy re-recording old bits.  Sorry.  Where are the fucking tours?  He's busy.  Because you still have to fucking work your ass off on satellite radio.  So XM blew you off.  You went to the little doggy company.  Where's the big tours to tell everyone about satellite? 
[02:42:30]  College tours.  What's he going to get in one of those raccoon skin coats?  23 Skidoo.  College boy.  Where's he going to do it?  A little past the college tour, my friend.  What's he going to do?  A cake stand?  I don't know how many college kids actually give a flying fuck about Howard Stern.  It's not 1989 anymore, you fucking idiot.  I sit there and go, are they on acid?  Are they tripping and I'm the only one not at the party?  Where is everybody?  Wake up, god damn it. 
[02:43:00]  Don't!  I mean, I'm sitting there.  I go, I think these guys are in a coma.  Wake up, guys, people.  You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  What's wrong, buddy?  Fine.  Are you sad?  No.  I'm scared.  Are you scared?  Only when you yell.  Only when the devil comes.  I love this shit, man.  I can't even tell you.  I love it.  We had muzzles on for so long. 
[02:43:30]  That he can't do anything now except whine and cry.  Go ahead.  Well, ONA Pess, you heard him.  So I guess we should just give up on the whole concept.  We're only able to recruit, what, seven, four?  Is it two, four, or seven that we have?  I love exaggerated humor.  Yeah.  But exaggerated facts to make someone look stupid is so embarrassing.  Yeah.  Like when Scott Farrell said, ah, they have five listeners.  Five listeners.  And then Alan Sniffen on the New York radio message board. 
[02:44:00]  Ah, satellite radio.  Yeah, they have, what, 100 subscribers?  A couple of hundred subscribers.  A couple of hundred subscribers.  Meanwhile, a-  Howie.  What?  They have four army members?  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, we watched 1,300 people in one room, in one fucking place, at one time,  ripping apart Scott Farrell.  And that was nothing because that's just the people that were there at that, in one fucking  room.  Think of the rest of the outlets the people had to call from, what they were doing, other 
[02:44:30]  rooms.  That's how it works.  Four people, eh, 1,300.  Yeah.  Same thing.  What is Alan Sniffen, though?  He should be rubbing his half-hard dick on the knee of a passed-out woman while he's  got his fucking dumb fingers in her mouth.  Fucking dentist.  She's coming out of it.  Yeah.  Better button up that blouse.  I better yak your tooth.  How did a dentist become an expert on New York radio? 
[02:45:00]  Exactly.  Explain that to me.  Anthony, it's never been done before on our show.  Uh-oh.  But the day has arrived.  There's your key, sir.  And here's my key.  Can I have a key?  No.  I want a key.  It's a key?  I like keys.  You don't have enough responsibility in your bones to have one of these keys.  But I like keys.  Turn your key, sir.  I will turn my key.  Turn your key.  Here it is.  On.  Wait.  Ready?  Set.  Go. 
[02:45:30]  There it is.  Thank you.  The key is turned.  We have confirmation.  We just turned the keys.  I feel sorry for everybody.  Me too.  I'm sorry.  You just can't have a key yet, Jimmy.  I want a key.  I can give you the little one.  I don't want the little one.  Look, I'll give Jimmy the little one.  I want a bigger key.  So he can feel like he's...  The little one.  Here.  I'll give you the little one.  That's to the file cabinet in the room where the key... 
[02:46:00]  Turn, turn.  ...where the missile silo keys are.  Here.  Put this key on your key, Jimmy.  I don't want that faggot key.  I want a man's key.  Here.  You got the little key.  No.  So you feel like you're part of this.  That's embarrassing.  That's the child's key, and I don't want it.  It's the tiniest key I could find, and it's yours, Jimmy.  Your fucking lock?  Yeah.  Bicycle lock?  That's a...  I don't want it.  What are you, open a cockhole with that?  I want a big key.  Well, that was fun. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  It's great to listen to him lose his mind.  Quote bullshit.  Let's say hi to John in Minnesota.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I wish Jimmy was as pissed at Howard as you guys are, man, because he would really add  to it.  But, hey, I wonder if he isn't in the anger or the...  You're having a real problem here, aren't you, John?  Yeah, a little trouble.  Let me start over for you.  Slow down. 
[02:47:00]  Start over.  Don't be nervous, son.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  I got to tell you, John.  Don't worry.  There's a mere million people listening right now.  That's no real big deal.  Trust me.  We've talked to bigger audiences in our past.  So don't picture the millions of listeners or the million listeners that are listening  to you right now.  In two countries.  In two countries, by the way.  All the way from Vancouver to...  Florida.  Florida.  Miami.  Yeah.  I saw some guy selling his car in front of his house.  It was a for sale sign.  It was a 68 Nova.  Yeah.  And I looked in. 
[02:47:30]  No XM.  No XM.  That's bad marketing.  We're done.  We're doomed.  All right, John.  Hey, I want to know if he's in the anger phase or the denial phase of the death of his  career.  Yeah, it's got to be rough.  No, you know, when he reaches the acceptance page, you'll see him doing infomercials late  and tight with fucking hair care products.  Got to be rough for all those millions of listeners.  Yeah.  And then you go to satellite thinking they're all going to follow you and they don't.  Yeah.  And your subscriptions start tapering off. 
[02:48:00]  You're not getting the calls that you were getting because you have a very limited audience  now.  The show that you hate, the Opie and Anthony show, has more listeners than you do.  That's got to kill him.  Hmm.  That's got to be rough.  What's going on, bro?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  This is one of your four pests.  Yeah, we only have four.  Hi.  Dude, I am so sick of this crap, man.  I dealt with this shit on Power Talk last night with these idiot fucking Stern fans and 
[02:48:30]  now this fucking hook nose hack today with this bullshit.  This fucking idiot is so delusional, he doesn't realize that with a flick of our fingers,  we fucking own him.  Yeah.  We own him.  That's how it works.  That's why I said push the button.  He's done.  Look at what we did to Phillips file.  Look at what we just fucking did to Pharrell in five days.  Yeah.  Took down Pharrell in five days.  It was done.  We ruined him.  We ruined them.  And you know what?  Hope you like your phones, Howard. 
[02:49:00]  Hope you like all your phones.  Howard doesn't know how to fucking deal with us because he doesn't seem to understand that  we have nothing better to do than to ruin people's lives.  That's our boys.  Goddamn.  Doug is having an influence.  You hear the brain?  You know what?  Yeah.  When I get home.  The brainwashing that's going on?  Love it.  When I get home later, I'll be contacting Doug, Bam, everybody.  I'm going to see what we're going to do.  Let's see what the next move is.  You guys turn the key.  Game on.  We just turned the key.  And listen to me.  Game fucking on.  Listen to me. 
[02:49:30]  To the guys that are in charge of this whole damn thing, just be smart.  Yeah.  You have shown.  Smart, man.  You guys have shown your intelligence in recent months.  Let's keep that going, please.  Guys, you know how smart we are.  You know how careful we are because we want to destroy them.  Clever always wins, buddies.  Yes.  The whole gas in the lobby thing that you set on fire.  Let's wait on that.  Yeah.  That was my idea.  We're not going fight club mentality yet.  Not yet.  Well, hopefully it doesn't come to that. 
[02:50:00]  Hopefully we can destroy him the way only we know how.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Why is fucking Ellen dressed like Professor Snottenberry?  My God, those are awful clothes.  Jesus.  Just a nightmare.  All right.  It's like fucking Shakespeare if he was a metrosexual.  Stupid clothes.  Kurt, what's up?  Hey, man.  A long time pal talk wanker.  Yeah.  First time caller.  Hey, I talked to an industry insider at a Peugeot dealer, and dude, he's not moving the serious 
[02:50:30]  stuff at all.  Say good.  It proves we're winning.  There you go.  Peugeot is all ours.  Man, hey, the virus is all over down here.  You guys have converted all of us guys in North Carolina to going, yuck, and stop it over  and over.  We fucking sound like you guys now, and Jimmy's our hero.  Jimmy's everyone's hero.  You know what, we had hoo-hoo for a while down here, but dude, it got old.  It was fucking breast implants. 
[02:51:00]  It was the same shit.  There's a revolution going on over there now, though.  A revolution.  And then they dropped him, and you know, the guy who followed him is now on Extreme XM, and  we all were waiting for this guy's show to come on.  I mean, in the very beginning, with the shitty radio we had, we thought, this is like in  97, we thought, oh man, this guy's incredible.  But yeah, after a while, we were like, shit, this is getting old, and you know.  He just stopped caring, dude.  Stopped caring.  The virus is out. 
[02:51:30]  The virus is out.  Bye, mister.  Let's go to Mike in South Carolina.  We're going to try to move on, but the phones, they have exploded.  Mike, what's up?  Oh, man, just wanted to let you guys know, I love the show.  Just last week, a buddy of mine turned me on to you guys, and I mean, I fell in love.  I went out and bought an Extreme Radio just because of the show.  He put me on the website.  Yeah, see, that's the virus working right there.  That's why we call it the O&A virus.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, buddy.  Thanks, Mikey.  How's that pay-per-view thing working out for him? 
[02:52:00]  Remember that e-show he used to do for free?  And now you can see that on pay-per-view?  Yeah.  I wonder what the numbers are like on that, some kind of on-demand thing that you got  to pay to see.  I wonder how that's working out.  Not too good.  I bet people are just signing up in droves for that thing, Howie.  Howie, how's that working out?  I'm waiting for the Howie math on that.  I got some news, by the way, a bad news for Sirius.  A good friend of mine is a schooner salesman, and he said they're not moving Sirius models  at all.  You mean an actual schooner? 
[02:52:30]  Absolutely.  The only time they move a Sirius is when they need to sink one.  They put a Sirius in the middle.  To scuttle it.  To scuttle it out.  Whatever that means.  I just like the word.  To scuttle a ship.  Ooh.  You sink it yourself.  Hello, bro, whoever this is.  Like if you scuttle your wife in Modesto?  Right.  I just scuttled her and the baby.  We're not getting names today.  This is Tim.  Tim.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Timmy!  What's up, Jimmy?  That's me being exuberant.  Yeah.  I got to thank you guys.  You guys opened my eyes to hoo-hoo, Howie. 
[02:53:00]  Two short months ago, I was going to have a listener.  Yeah.  I go to Best Buy.  I said, hey, give me the portable Sirius.  They look at me like I have two fucking heads.  I said, give me the portable unit.  They don't have one.  My brother-in-law said, no, no, no.  I'm going to get you guys the Tau, the XM to go.  Beautiful fucking device.  So that Sirius company got me to go to XM, but you guys got me to stay.  Fuck Howard.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  That language isn't necessary.  There you go.  All right.  That was fun.  That was an hour and a half. 
[02:53:30]  As he loses his mind over there, we continue to have fun over here.  By the way, I want to thank Howard.  We really did have nothing to do today on this show.  Thank you for the material.  Some days we just lucked out playing his audio.  Oh, we were going to just plow through this shit.  Howard Sparks.  Really.  We were just going to plow through this shit today and make believe we are the greatest  broadcasters ever.  The fact is, ah, we didn't have much.  We didn't have much to do today.  But because of you, you just gave us a nice hour and a half.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  What do you guys say we show a little bit of a program unity and I'll go to the men's  room together?  You want to all take a leak together?  More than I want to breathe.  Me, you.  All right, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  You're listening to the radio show that is still having fun.  More listeners.  That still has the passion to do this.  That's right.  Bob and Tom.  The O.P. and Anthony program.  Search and, seek and destroy. 
[02:54:30]  Search and, seek and destroy.  Uh-oh, breaking news from John Q in Boston.  Yes.  Says, breaking news, serious models being recalled from spacecrafts because eight-ton units compromised  takeoffs.  It won't be on the shuttle.  And, by the way, you can listen to us online.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Howie doesn't want to do that one yet because he's not making money on that.  Nope.  Got to squeeze every dime out of it.  Yeah, if you want to listen to this show for free, just go to eatitbullet.com under the  calendar section.  That's right.  Whore.  What?  You're a whore.  I'm not.  I'm a good boy.  And someone is very mad that we said we make believe we're brilliant broadcasters.  Anthony D'Angelo from Tony Bagel's Whack Bag. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, Tony Bagel.  Make believe?  No, you guys are brilliant broadcasters.  Oh.  I'll second that.  There's a lot of really, really funny freaking, uh, listen, feedbacks coming in.  Yes.  See, because we still throw the funny in there, even though we're pissed off.  Occasionally.  Oops, did I just give away a little secret?  Oops.  I had a bit idea.  Where's the funny, Howie?  Where's the funny?  You had a bit idea?  Mm-hmm.  What are you, crazy?  No, it was a good one, too.  This would have just set the bar.  Did you run this past anyone? 
[02:56:00]  No, live on the page.  Look how he licks his fingers.  I have to to turn the pages.  Look, but you stick your tongue out all like, ew, well, look, he's got a bit idea, but he  doesn't know what paper.  No.  He's panicking.  I'm all, but I, guys, I don't want to throw, oh, no, it's not this one.  Oh, my God.  Aw.  Where's your bit idea?  Oh, it's in here.  You wait.  All right, we'll wait.  You wait.  What is it about?  Oh, I don't remember.  I just saw it, and I went, we should do that.  Is it, it looks like you'll look.  Ah.  Here it is. 
[02:56:30]  Ah, let's see who laughs last.  Strangers to Ty Knott on PLJ's webcast.  Oh.  That's right.  That gets, uh.  Put on your excitement hats.  I don't think I own one.  Well, you better get one.  Right, fella?  Morning hosts Scott and Todd have spent the past two weeks arranging two strangers in a wedding where the catch is that the wedding couple won't meet until minutes before they say, I do. 
[02:57:00]  Oh.  And I think we should do something like that, and I think we should do something like that, only with diseases.  I think something, man.  You're getting a huge laugh from out in the hall.  Are you kidding?  That's what they're doing?  That's what they're doing.  It's going to be a fake wedding.  No, it's going to be real, Opie.  Scott and Todd don't fake things.  So it's like, Opie, you've done radio for many years.  You know a lot of the ins and outs of the standard hack-type radio. 
[02:57:30]  This is a little different than the normal wedding zoo morning bit.  Zoo morning wedding.  Usually they marry a couple on Valentine's Day or something.  Yeah.  Or they get outrageous and they marry, you know, the same sex.  Whoa.  Because they want to be edgy.  Alternative.  That's nice.  This is a new concept.  So they just, they don't know the people.  But then they're going to get married when they-  But you know what?  Mark my word.  Let's do some research. 
[02:58:00]  They never really get married.  There's going to be some kind of loophole where they're like,  Hey, they get out of it.  Yeah, there's an annulment thing or something.  Well, the guy's not really a preacher.  Yeah, there's going to be something.  So it's just words.  Because, you know, they want the water cooler talk.  They want everyone to be-  Can you believe what they're doing?  Well, by gosh, it's working because Jimmy was talking about-  And I thought of it at the cooler.  Well, that's what pisses me off.  The fucking radio column in the Daily News.  David Hinckley, who did a very fine article on us recently.  Thank you, David.  He buys into this horse shit and promotes it. 
[02:58:30]  It's just going to be some phony radio bit.  No one's going to get married.  If you wonder why this show is a scourge,  they're doing like a little wedding bit.  And the one show did the thing about the kitten in the balloon.  And you bringing people to have their genitals stung by wasps.  Yes.  And we watch gentlemen taser their assholes.  Yes.  Live.  Hey, is that video available yet?  I saw one clip of it yesterday.  I got to tell you, thank God that Howard came to Satellite Radio.  Because before he got here, we didn't even know that tasing of the asshole was possible. 
[02:59:00]  This is true.  Didn't even know it.  No, that's one you got to give to the blacks.  If it wasn't for the blacks and their relationship with the police department.  We wouldn't know.  Never know the humor value of a taser.  We got that video somewhere there, E-Rock?  Yeah, because I haven't seen the video yet.  Not where it's synced up with the sound or anything.  Yeah, we're trying to sync up the sound.  Because I know there's got to be somebody smart that could actually take the show audio,  not the audio from PalTalk, but the show audio,  sync it up to the video that was on PalTalk, 
[02:59:30]  and make a nice little production piece out of it.  No, Than's waving his hand like he did it?  No?  Steve did it already?  Steve did it.  Why isn't it a headline on opianthony.com?  Is it on shipping?  Why is E-Rock going into search mode to try to find this?  I don't know, but I know E-Rock's about to get a good scolding and perhaps a slap.  No, I like the E-Rock.  I do too, but I might have to go over there and give him a scolding.  E-Rock has come a long way.  He's starting to get this whole thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think...  Our little E-Rock.  I don't know.  I have to disagree. 
[03:00:00]  I think he's a punk.  Wow.  What's the screaming about?  Everyone's heckling you.  Eric, how?  They're yelling at you, Steve.  Why are they yelling at you, Steve?  As you're going to the other room.  Steve, what are you doing?  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  I love that song.  I'm going to go old school.  It's Martini, Steve.  Oh.  Martini, Steve.  It's Martini, Steve. 
[03:00:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr.  Grr.  I'll wait.  Yes, yes.  Go ahead.  He won't do it.  As you were saying it, I've been instant messaging.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Shut up.  All right.  Yes, it's all linked up on the front.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That was loving.  You're going to take that shit, Anthony?  Yes, he is.  It's on the front page.  Yeah, it's on the front page.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr. 
[03:01:00]  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  I want to see what people want to see more.  The tasing of the nuts or the tasing of the ass.  Wow, yeah.  All right.  We keep tabs on that?  Yeah.  I would say tasing of the ass.  All right, tasing of the nuts got downloaded so far 1,077 times, right?  Yeah.  All right.  And the tasing of the ass, does it be tasing of the nuts?  I think so.  I'll say yes.  You'll say yes?  I'll say no. 
[03:01:30]  Just give him 40 minutes to open it.  Oh, wow.  More people want to see the tasing of the ass.  Yeah.  But it was a very close race.  Can we say it?  I want to see him go into the wall again.  That was hilarious.  The guy just flew forward.  Yeah, it's on opanthony.com.  He couldn't get up.  Guy tased himself in the nutsack and in the anus yesterday on the program.  His wife actually did the tasing.  Oh, the wife did it.  You're right.  His wife actually did the tasing.  And the guy hammering in his own butt plug with his ball sack, how many times has that  been hit?  I want to see how sick our listeners are.  Oh, I can't tell because it's on somebody else's site. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Did I tell you about my battle to get my name and how it worked out?  You know my domain name?  Anthonycumia.com?  Mm-hmm.  Some guy had it.  And it was just directing traffic to his site.  He did some kind of a podcast.  And you'd punch in anthonycumia.com.  And it would take you to this guy's site.  Apparently, or allegedly, he was a fan of the show.  And, you know, I send people out. 
[03:02:30]  I send people out to get my name because it's my name.  My name.  So as the people are working on it, he emailed me and said, dude, I'm letting the domain  name expire.  You could pick it up after it expires.  He let the fucking thing expire.  You know what happens to domain names that expire?  They go on to an auction.  So there I am on this fucking website having to bid on my own name against some guy who 
[03:03:00]  I did a little research on buys domain names and sells them.  That had to get, I don't know, tens of cents.  Well, here's the thing.  It kind of puts your life in perspective, doesn't it?  How much did your name fetch?  I didn't want to.  How much did it fetch?  I had to pay $1.79.  I had to pay $360 for my name.  Now, I was happy because I was willing to bid about $3,000 I was going to pay to get 
[03:03:30]  my name back.  This guy's bidding against me, and we're kind of going back and forth a little bit, and  he stopped at like $350.  He bailed at $350?  And then I was happy that I didn't have to pay more than like $365, but then I started  thinking, this motherfucker doesn't think my name is worth more than this.  You could have negotiated this in a dollar store.  How small do you feel today?  You're not going to like my statement. 
[03:04:00]  I was a little like, what, Jimmy Norton?  JimNorton.com.  The guy won't sell it.  I had a similar problem.  Why won't he sell it?  Because he's a cunt.  But you are Jimmy Norton.  Jim Norton.  And the quote I heard was like over $20,000.  $20,000 for JimNorton.com.  I would never pay it.  I'm fooling.  I have JimNorton.net.  That's extortion.  Yeah.  Dot net is great.  A lot of people go to that.  Dot net has taken over the world.  Maybe not, but I want dot org.  Dot net is just dot edu. 
[03:04:30]  Congratulations.  Jimmy, I'd be happy with a dot net.  Can someone show me how to get my dot com?  I get all these dumb things.  Dude, go check it.  I know who he is.  I don't know how to get it.  You would have a problem if his name is also Jim Norton.  No, it's not.  He's a cyber squatter.  Douche.  All right.  Well, then you might be able to.  My name is a little odd and obscure.  There aren't many Anthony Cumias.  I have an odd last name like that that isn't very popular.  Me being such a huge celebrity.  It makes it easier for me to claim a name like that. 
[03:05:00]  What ancestor decided to change the pronunciation of your last name, by the way?  I've always wanted to ask you this question.  It doesn't look like Cumia.  It's like Cumia or, well, years ago I used to pronounce it Cumia.  That doesn't look like Cumia either.  What is it, Cumia?  Yeah.  So there was an ancestor somewhere that said, hey, man, this is not cool for the family.  We got to change the pronunciation.  No, because the original pronunciation from Sicily is Cumia.  Cumia.  Cumia.  Hey, Cumia. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, that's kind of romantic.  So it's now Cumia without the Cumia thing.  And, yeah, that's it.  Actually, you got a cool last name.  It's just a link page.  What am I saying?  I'm a Hughes.  Hughes.  That's pretty common.  See, Greg Hughes would probably be hard to get, too.  Do you know that my...  I'm sure it's taken, right?  I don't know.  Let's look.  Do you know that my cousin...  Gay porno?  Yeah.  Do you know that my cousin married a Hughes? 
[03:06:00]  That's a little weird.  So a Hughes married a Hughes.  Isn't that a little weird?  And you do a radio show with a Hughes.  Two Gs or one on your name?  Wait, I'm trying to think about what Norton just said.  Oh, shit.  You had so much confidence that I was going to figure that out, too.  What is this?  You're just acting like, yeah, you keep thinking.  This is a good one.  This is my website, greghughes.com? 
[03:06:30]  What is it?  It's two baby pictures and some old guy holding a baby.  Oh, shit, man.  I hope this isn't my son.  We're slamming this guy's bandwidth right now.  This guy's probably got, like, the Yahoo simple plan for things.  He's just, like, if you download a picture three times, it's done.  And right now he's getting hammered.  What's the, uh, what's the...  Wrestling?  What is this?  What's the front page?  Uh-oh.  A picture's already gone.  Baby pics, Waynesboro Blues Brothers, and wrestling. 
[03:07:00]  A night the state of Georgia will not soon forget Jake and Elwood Blues.  Oh, it looks to me like these wacky people on greghughes.com got together and did a little  Blues Brothers, uh, skit.  What a bunch of dorks.  Ugh.  See, you'd have a little bit of a problem getting this, because the guy's name is probably Greg.  No, you wouldn't.  Not if the fans kept hitting it, you wouldn't.  Not if he got, uh, fucking 500 emails.  He'd probably cough it right up.  We're like Hitler. 
[03:07:30]  We're gonna go too far.  I want jimnorton.com.  Hold on to Russia.  It's my name.  How can you have a claim to it?  It's mine.  He's sitting on it.  Is, does he work for a business that has that name, like an auto group, maybe called Jim  Norton Motors or something like that?  No, just sitting there.  By the way, Jim Norton Motors, not moving a single XM unit.  No, they're not.  And you could probably get it back to have your attorney.  What attorney?  Eatman?  Eatman tried to get it for me.  Look what they got on me.  And, and fucking Eatman tried to do it.  I know he didn't do it right.  He put a bid in ahead of time so they knew somebody wanted it.  You don't have to bid on it. 
[03:08:00]  All you have to do is prove that you're making money with that name as a stage name, and you  can probably get it handed right over to you.  How?  Yes, a lot of times you can get it.  What lawyer can I talk to to do this?  No one's helping me.  A domain lawyer.  That's right.  Intellectual property rights attorney can do that for you.  Oh, or Steve C.  Well, can you help me with that?  Yes, I can.  I would go over and maul him.  Yeah.  I don't hear a lot of help.  I hear a lot of jargon perfectly enunciated.  You should talk to, you should talk to Paul Jacobs.  Oh.  Who's he?  Wasn't he the angry bully guy in the play that Billy wrote this morning? 
[03:08:30]  I would like to have Jim Norton.com.  You can get it.  Can we listen to some Star Jones audio?  You bet we can.  We love Star Jones because she just babbles and babbles and babbles and babbles.  Everybody knows that I am a diehard Democrat, but I went to the basketball game to watch  the NBA All-Star game.  You know, it's sort of like our anniversary.  We got engaged there.  Oh, that's right.  Two years ago.  And I'm sitting down and a friend introduces me to George Bush, President 41.  Okay. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, really?  The senior Bush.  Now, I don't like his policies.  I didn't even care for him.  I actually became giddy.  I realized when you're in the presence of the president.  Does that mean hungry?  It doesn't matter.  It's the president.  So now this one who has interviewed everybody on this planet would never get giddy, and  I kept trying to be Barbara, go, try to have dignity, Star.  Have dignity.  And I go, how you doing, Mr. President?  She met a president.  Who hasn't in this room?  I got to tell you, you know, you do get a little giddy when you meet a president. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, here he goes.  You really do.  When you have that moment with one of the leaders of the free world.  When I opened up my Christmas card from Richard Milhouse Nixon, I got a little giddy.  Sure.  My signed Christmas card from Richard Nixon back when I was a kid.  Very excited.  Never met a president, though.  No.  I met a president, and I was giddy for a little while, but then I put my arm right around him.  Secret Service wrestled you to the ground. 
[03:10:00]  Click, click.  Beat that, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy can't beat that.  You still haven't beaten that celebrity photo.  Beat the Clinton picture.  Not that one, no, but I will.  I'll get it in volume.  He'll get a president.  No, it's not about volume.  It's about quality of celebrity.  How about, would De Niro and Pacino together beat Clinton?  Do you have that picture?  That's big.  No.  If I had that, you'd know it's going to be hanging behind you.  Would it?  I think the only way you beat a president is a more popular president. 
[03:10:30]  If one is fucking you up the ass and you're blowing the other.  How about if I got Bin Laden and Zarqawi, and all three of us are doing Beastie Boy poses?  I would give it to you.  I would give you the title at that point.  And then they chopped off my head and laughed at me.  Yeah.  Why are they laughing at this?  Oh, shit.  Nah.  Let's stay away from that.  Can I see it at least?  Leave him alone.  Don't do it to the guy.  Leave him alone.  And he said to me that he was getting ready to go to the Dominican Republic. 
[03:11:00]  So me, instead of being dictified and asking something about world politics, I said,  Oh, you just want to get brown like me.  And I honest to God said this to the president of the United States.  And he said, If I could, I would.  I liked him.  I really did like him.  Yeah, George Bush Sr. wants to be black.  If I could, I would.  He does not.  He does not.  I mean, he probably said, Get away from me. 
[03:11:30]  I thought my stupid mic is coming up.  I don't know.  The mic stand thing kind of went down there.  I'm sure someone behind the scenes got fired for not getting him out of that situation fast enough.  Oh, yeah.  Star Jones.  That's the reality of the situation.  But he probably had no idea who she was.  He's old.  He's an older gentleman.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Probably asked what it was like to work with Naomi Watts.  Guys, I can't get enough of Tyra Banks.  Now we're just going through shit in front of us here. 
[03:12:00]  That's the beauty of having archives.  Tyra Banks.  I want everyone to watch America's Next Top Model.  I can't get enough of this fucking show.  Because you want to talk about another person that has a massive ego.  Massive ego, delusional, thinks the world revolves around her.  She browbeats these people that are looking to be the winner of the show.  And at the end of the show, you know how they have to vote someone off.  That's such an original idea.  Thanks, Mark Burnett, for sending us down that road. 
[03:12:30]  Voting people off.  Voting people off.  So at the end of the show, America's Top Model, you're looking at tens in this room every single episode.  Nice.  Tyra Banks stands in front of them.  And it's not good enough that she just stands in front of them and browbeats the shit out of them, right?  Saying like, look, I can tell from this picture.  And they're looking at these pictures where they're just drop-dead gorgeous.  I can tell you don't want it.  I can just tell.  But I do.  Look at your eyes. 
[03:13:00]  You're somewhere else.  And these girls are perfect.  She does this as she stands on a box so she's taller than them and looks down at them.  She stands on another model?  Is that what you were?  She was eligible to be doing a handstand on one.  You know, so her face is closed.  VH1 was doing, you know, a rerun of one of the past seasons, right?  And this girl that was getting kicked off, just, she's like, she's unbelievable how hot she is. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  And this girl is losing it because she realizes she just got kicked off the show.  And she's just crying uncontrollably, right?  We love the crying audio.  Uncontrollably.  You know, maybe we can find that.  Thang, can we find that?  The model Crying Her Eyes Out?  They might rerun it on VH1.  Crying Her Eyes Out.  This was a dream.  She was born to do this.  This is all she wanted to do with her life.  Tyra Banks actually says this.  This is very tough for me this week because I'm debuting my new music video. 
[03:14:00]  Wait, tough for her?  Right.  What makes it extra tough for me is because today I'm debuting my new music video.  Oh, and you can see it on eatabullet.com.  I'm just a plug whore.  You can, too.  I know you can't.  The new season of America's Next Top Model starts soon, and we're going to have lots of  audio because I can't get enough of this show and how she just talks down to people.  Do you like Tyra?  You guys.  She's beyond beautiful. 
[03:14:30]  But between the ears, nothing.  I think it makes her look ugly, Jimmy.  You know, it's funny you should say that.  I tend to look inside.  She has nothing inside.  That's right.  It's all about her because she's been told her whole life how beautiful she is.  No, I mean, I tend to look inside, I mean, by opening the asshole.  Getting a little gaping.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's take a little look-see.  So Tyra Banks on her other show because she's the new Oprah. 
[03:15:00]  I mean, let's be honest here.  She's just as good.  She's terrific.  She did a show on phobias.  I'm afraid of shows on phobias.  What are you scared of, Anthony?  What are you scared of?  That's fun.  What am I scared of?  Yeah.  I'm scared of the dark.  Jimmy, what are you scared of?  I have trisky-decaphobia.  I'm scared of the number 13.  No.  I have kicked off the air again of phobia. 
[03:15:30]  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Oof.  I have no phobias.  Can't pay the mortgage phobia.  Yeah.  I have the, hey, Bob Kelly, could you help me move a phobia?  I'm scared of the ghost that greets me every morning, but I'm not going to talk about it  right now.  I hate ghosts.  There is a ghost?  I don't know.  I think it might be my eyes playing tricks on me.  But the hair stands up on the back of my neck, and I get that feeling like, holy shit,  holy shit, holy shit.  Wait, wait.  When your hair stands up, do you only see this ghost in socks on a carpet? 
[03:16:00]  Does he ever touch you, and you hear a tick, and get a little blue spark?  No.  Your ghost is a faggot.  I'm scared.  Like, I get pretty much the shit scared out of me every morning.  Because I wake up, and since we're ready to move, not a lot of things put away. 
[03:16:30]  A lot of clothing on hangers that are kind of around the room.  I thought it was crazy.  Now we've got to talk about this.  Thank you.  There was one day, the treadmill and a shirt and something behind it all melded into one  image of a RoboCop in my room, ready to kill me.  I've been kind of debating if I should bring this up on the show.  Oh, you just nailed exactly what I've been dealing with for weeks now. 
[03:17:00]  And I live in, like, it's two floors.  I sleep in the basement, okay?  Yep.  I come upstairs every morning, literally seconds after the alarm goes off.  I'm one of these guys, especially because of these stupid hours, you don't have time  to kind of hang out in bed.  No.  Alarm goes off.  Bam, turn off the alarm.  Get up and just go.  So we're not late.  Do you bounce off walls?  Oh, man.  I get up and I have to make, like, a 90-degree turn to get into the bathroom. 
[03:17:30]  Every day, the hip goes right into the fucking dresser.  I'm almost falling down.  You've got, like, morning fucking hard-on sticking straight down.  You know how many times I hear this from downstairs?  I thought Jimmy would want to hear that.  This is what I hear from downstairs almost every morning.  You all right?  Yeah.  But that would be a female voice.  You all right?  You okay?  You okay?  Yeah.  Well, I get worried.  You might hurt yourself.  Jimmy.  Because I'm banging into things. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  I have bruises all over my legs.  I cannot swing that corner without having to frigging put my arm up.  We are the stupidest people on radio, by the way, to start our morning careers at our  age.  This is like something you should start when you're in your early 20s.  You two idiots waiting until you're 34.  Oh, my God.  I'll admit to 35.  All right?  It is 35.  Old ribbon candy hip.  Anyway.  It's going to take one fall and it's over, Johnny.  Every morning.  So I go upstairs and I thought nothing of it for months and months and months.  But recently, two to three weeks ago, it started. 
[03:18:30]  I walk upstairs, just woke up, like I said, seconds.  Go up the stairs and I see what I believe is a ghost on the couch.  And then, boom, it just disappears.  I'm like, holy shit.  Holy shit.  And I literally have the fear where someone kill me now.  Like, just get it over with.  I was so fucking scared.  The hair is standing up on the back of my neck, as they say.  You just get that feeling.  You feel like an actual electric shock goes through your body.  Yeah.  You feel the needles going through your whole body because you're that scared, right? 
[03:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And it was gone.  I'm like, okay.  Dude, it was happening every fucking morning.  The alarm clock would go off.  I was scared to go upstairs because I'm like, I'm going to see that thing again.  Room for one more, honey.  The ghost of parties past, just one lonely ghost with chips and no seats for his friends.  My Super Bowl party was good.  I'm thirsty. 
[03:19:30]  Where are the beverages?  Bring me some fruit from the corner.  I have to stand because there aren't seats.  The ghost is probably scared of all the mice.  Mice ghost.  You electrocuted me.  Well, the mice play into this, by the way, because now I'm downstairs.  It's the middle of night, and I'm being woken up because I hear footprints. 
[03:20:00]  Upstairs.  I'm like, oh, boy.  And I'm half awake or half asleep, whatever.  And you hear this, and I'm like, now the ghost is running around upstairs.  They'll do that.  No, I did some research on that.  It's not a ghost.  That's just the mice running between the ceiling of the downstairs and the floor of the upstairs.  But what do you see on the couch?  It's a quick image like, oh, my God, that is a person, and then poof.  But what is it?  You still don't know?  Or is it clothing?  No, so it's going on every day. 
[03:20:30]  Every day, every day.  To the point I was so scared.  I'm leaving lights on at my age.  Yeah, I do that.  Upstairs.  I'm leaving the lights on.  And know what I do before I go to bed now?  Because this is the only thing I think it is, is exactly what you just described.  Things are placed in such a way on the couch that it looks like a person.  Like, I prop a pillow up when I'm watching TV.  There's a little couch blanket that happens to be like this and hanging off the couch a little bit.  Now it's an arm.  And then there's a, yeah, and then there's a water glass that I left out the night before. 
[03:21:00]  So now all of a sudden.  There's a gun.  All of a sudden.  Yeah, exactly.  Now the ghost is holding the water cup.  It all just lines up.  Yeah.  So that's the only thing I can think of.  So every morning I'm like, oh, please don't see anything.  Please don't see anything.  And I walk up the stairs.  It's been a thing that's been happening with me for almost a month.  Leave the light on.  Now I leave the lights.  Not only do I leave the lights on upstairs, before I go to bed, I study the room and go,  okay, could any of this shit look like a ghost in the morning? 
[03:21:30]  And I go, yes, that blanket.  That can.  I'm not even kidding.  That blanket's still on the couch like that.  Looks like a person laying down.  Nope.  Throw the blanket behind the couch.  That pillow has to go in another room.  Now you just made it into a monster.  Now that pillow has to go into another room.  Now the ghost won't have a head.  Hang up all the fucking coats.  Don't leave them on the leather recliner.  That looks like someone just hanging out.  Or stop acting four.  Dude.  It shocks you.  Thank you, because Anthony's with me on this one.  Look, I understand that sometimes a shirt on a hanger, if it's positioned right, will 
[03:22:00]  look like a ghost.  I was half asleep one time and my closet door was open and I thought immediately there were  75 ghosts standing shoulder to shoulder and I didn't know why.  And they were awfully thin.  Very close, single file line waiting to kill me.  That's right.  A bunch of ghosts not looking at me.  Your first thought was, they need a sandwich.  They're getting too thin.  Some of the things are like, it's only the position you're in because like some of the  items are five feet behind.  Right, right. 
[03:22:30]  But it all lines up.  Or the bad guy.  Right, right.  And then from right where you are, it lines up perfectly.  So if you stand up, it doesn't look anything like it.  But from laying in bed, right when I open my eyes, I see legs, arms, and a shady looking  head with, and there's someone standing in the room looking at me.  Yes.  I am so glad you said this today.  Petrified.  It'll make me sleep better now.  Because this has been something that's been driving me crazy.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm like, am I seeing shit?  And it only happens for a split second because your eyes are just starting to focus because 
[03:23:00]  you just got out of bed.  I don't like walking into a dark house also.  When I walk in, I like having a light on.  My electric bill's ridiculous because I do leave a lot of lights on all the time.  Our light bulbs, now that we're moving, I have one light bulb left in what is considered  like the family room where the TV is and the couch.  There's one light bulb left in the vaulted ceiling because I don't have the pole to change  the light bulb.  And there's only one that's left burning. 
[03:23:30]  Okay, we're going to leave.  When we finally do move, there's not going to be one bulb working in this house because  we just leave the lights on all the time.  I have my place dark always.  You're a ghoul.  No, I never mind it.  I'm not afraid of it.  Jimmy, you are the monster in the room.  I thought it was a ghost.  It was just Norton jerking off on my couch.  Howdy.  Drop by.  I open.  It would have been fun to go to the phones and see, but we can't do phones today.  No.  And we still gave you guys great radio. 
[03:24:00]  Look at that.  We are brilliant broadcasters.  The phones have been broken the entire day.  This is how radio works.  We throw this out and all of a sudden, wow, that sparks a thing in my head.  I got a call voice.  Someone would call and say, you know, I woke up one day and blah, blah, blah, or it was  a real, I didn't give it any thought, but it turned out that it was a real guy in my  house.  Right.  Plenty of stories the listeners come up with.  We touched an old nerve because the phone's every single line ringing.  They all have a story about that.  And they're all labeled unknown and you can't answer them. 
[03:24:30]  Thank you.  Maybe they're ghosts.  And one is, this was one of those things I didn't want to bring to the show.  I'm like, people are going to just think I'm even more nuts than I am.  And then you said what you said.  Which really backs up your point with me saying that it's okay because I see it.  I'm the nuttiest guy on the crew.  And they got mice living within the walls.  I cannot wait to get out of my place.  And they are multiplying because there is a lot of them, man.  I've killed 12.  I can't kill them fast enough.  Today.  You're still killing them?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  I got one a couple days ago.  Oh, boy.  What day was that?  You're infested.  Tuesday or Wednesday.  They're nesting.  Oh, they're in the walls.  I'm not kidding.  I'll even hit the wall sometimes just to show off.  Like, listen to this.  Hit the wall and they just start scattering.  There's a lot.  It is a real problem.  You're infested.  Good luck.  Get the fuck out of there.  I'm trying.  And make sure you boil your clothes before you take them over to your new place.  Or you're just going to take a roach over there with you.  Do you have roaches, too?  Haven't seen a roach in a while. 
[03:25:30]  But you did have them?  You don't see them.  I haven't seen one in a long time.  There was one sitting on your couch with a derby cigar going, meh, meh.  I go for my house inspection today to find a little walkthrough with the builder and go,  that must be fixed.  That must be fixed.  Everything's actually done.  Just making sure everything's done.  Get that mold, inspector.  It's done already.  No mold.  The feedback.  Jimmy's tits from whackbag.com.  Opie.  Opie, most people hear footsteps, not footprints, dumbass. 
[03:26:00]  How do you hear a footprint?  I know.  It was then that I was a ghost.  I was just very excited.  I'm sorry.  I know.  It's all right.  But then, during the hardest part of my life, I didn't hear the footprints and realized  Jesus was carrying me.  I saw only one foot and I realized that Mabel King was Christ.  Then again, she had no legs.  Another one from whackbag.  How long till Anthony stumps, stump prints in the sand is the poem's name. 
[03:26:30]  Here's another one from whackbag.  Nine toes and I realized Pat Munaki is Lord.  Another one from whackbag.  How long till Anthony shoots his imaginary person?  I can't tell you how much buckshot I put through my periwinkle shirts.  How many fucking pillows are just going to be all fluffed up like in True Romance?  Honey, who is it?  A pillow.  Very scary in these houses.  Oh, wow.  A lot of people picked up on the footprints comments. 
[03:27:00]  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  That was my only mistake today, though.  I've been keeping track.  There was one more.  All right.  There might have been a few others.  Here's your outfit.  My outfit?  That's right.  What's wrong with my clothes today?  It's not an outfit.  It just clashes.  Ensemble.  It's a brown shirt and jeans.  Ensemble.  Ensemble.  Can't get any more boring than that.  All right.  And we can't go to the phones.  That velour sweat jacket he's wearing is really bugging me. 
[03:27:30]  You know what sucks?  We really needed the phones today, too.  Yeah.  We got a lot of good subject matter for callers.  We depend on our phones.  Boy, now we know what it feels like to have you have the phones taken right out from under you.  I know.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Hope we don't pick up and have a Ramon guy yelling.  Ramon!  All right.  Whatever.  All right.  So here's Tyra Banks on our show talking about phobias.  Yes.  Now here, guys.  The beginning of tomorrow's show, we could continue with this fine topic.  Because I know there's some good phone calls out there as far as this is concerned. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Because we really can't go to the phones.  Okay.  Bring it back up.  We'll bring it back up or someone remind us.  Anyway, Tyra Banks did a show on phobias on her new talk show because she's the new Oprah and she's terrific.  And she has a phobia of dolphins.  Dolphins.  Cute little animals.  The dolphin.  Tyra Banks.  Today, my guests and I are coming face to face with our fears and phobias.  Now, some of the fears that you're going to hear today may sound funny to some people. 
[03:28:30]  But trust me, from my guests and from me, too,  the fear that we feel is absolute terror.  Now, people may laugh at my fear.  My fear is dolphins.  I think the dolphins is ugly, but to me, they're not.  And I feel anxiety and I feel panic whenever I'm confronting or even thinking about or talking about a dolphin.  We're sharing a subway with a dolphin.  I went to SeaWorld to try to conquer my fear.  It's terrific.  It's terrific.  Right now I'm at the Loberge Del Mar Resort and Spa, and I came here a couple of days early because I needed to relax. 
[03:29:00]  I needed to kind of meditate because I really do have a true fear of dolphins, and I know I'm conquering that today.  But I couldn't just arrive today and just jump straight in because that would freak me out.  So I've been relaxing here, kind of getting into it, and I'm ready.  You hear that plug she threw out for the place?  They probably gave her free accommodations.  Oh, of course.  The Loberge Resort and Spa.  Is that important to the story?  Your fucking awful, stunted delivery? 
[03:29:30]  She's another one that is just so full of herself and have people around her that just tell her how great she is  that she doesn't see the ridiculousness of her phobia.  Jesus, thanks.  It's dolphins.  People have real fears out there.  You know what I'm afraid of?  Blacks.  That's right.  At least Tyra can walk around Manhattan, and you know what?  She's not going to run into a dolphin.  When's the last time 30 dolphins got on the subway car you were on and started fucking smoking and causing a problem? 
[03:30:00]  Right.  There is so many.  It's so easy to avoid dolphins your whole life.  You never have to see a dolphin.  Just in case.  Just stay away from SeaWorld and pretty much your phobia is cleared.  I'm going to bet you, you don't encounter a dolphin today.  Every time you eat tuna, just smile and think, ah, that's right, dolphins are faggots.  Her fear is dolphins.  What a shallow dolphin.  Out of all the scary shit in the water, too. 
[03:30:30]  And she built a whole show around it.  The dolphin.  What a fucking shallow, non-existent fear.  I wish she was afraid of, like, killer whales, and then she had her leg bitten off like Bo Derek in Orca.  Oh, that's a good scene.  I'm afraid of Richard Harris.  Who isn't?  It's on my couch every morning when I wake up.  I try to face my fear.  I'm afraid of girls tinkling in my mouth.  I'm trying to face it and overcome it every day. 
[03:31:00]  That's right.  I'm trying to drink my fear.  Well, here's the tease for tomorrow.  We'll do the phobia thing maybe when we first start tomorrow.  Rich Voss coming in tomorrow.  Ooh, Rich.  Tyra is afraid of dolphins, and she has someone on her show called Christina who's afraid of anyone?  Wait.  Butterflies?  Ooh, that would be scary.  I couldn't even.  Popsicles?  Oh, any army?  Baby cocks?  The answer is?  Anteater assholes? 
[03:31:30]  The answer is pennies.  Pennies.  She's doing a whole show about her phobia, which is dolphins, and Christina's phobia, which is pennies.  I would like to shoot pennies at her with a wrist rocket.  How much fun would that be?  We'll make her suck your dick and then pay her in pennies.  A big bag of them.  Can't beat us.  Over her head.  Oh.  But my phobia is...  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. 
[03:32:00]  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
