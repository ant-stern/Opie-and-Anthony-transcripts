<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a listener's quirky question about mailing an unpackaged banana, which a post office employee confirmed was permissible.  Following this, the hosts welcomed in-studio guests Robbie and John from the Goo Goo Dolls.  The band's initial audio suffered from a significant reverb effect, leading to jokes comparing the sound quality to papal broadcasts from the Popemobile.  Conversation turned to the band's demanding summer tour, revealing they'd only had fleeting visits back to their hometown of Buffalo.  This prompted a darkly humorous tangent about reckless and often fatal stunts at Niagara Falls, including a failed jet ski attempt, a suicide by kayak, and a harrowing drug-related incident near the falls' edge. The segment concluded with the Goo Goo Dolls performing a song, offering a preview of a forthcoming single they characterized as a departure from their current chart-topping hit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're Cursed Man anymore.  Well, if you stick around, we got the black version of Cursed Man on the way.  A legit guy.  Legit guy.  We got to kind of cut out his curses and then we'll be able to throw him on the radio.  Cursed Bro.  Cursed Bro is on the way.  Hey, you can get the latest concert club and comedy listings anytime you want just by dialing the WAF Infamaniac Hotline, 617-252-4AAF.  You can call that 24 hours a day, 617-252-4AAF.  That same number also gives you the most up-to-date weather and the joke of the day, 617-252-4AAF. 
[00:00:30]  Through the mail, as long as you have the right address on there and the proper postage.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Wait, you work at a post office?  Yeah, I work in Susbury.  Did you hear what we're doing?  What?  Well, I started yesterday.  I was just wondering if you could actually mail a banana through the mail, not putting it in an envelope or anything,  just writing the address right on the banana, putting a stamp on the banana,  and I was wondering if the post office would actually deliver it.  Yeah, they would.  Oh, that's awesome.  Yeah, we get coconut sometimes and all kinds of weird stuff. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, very cool.  Well, thanks for the info.  I'll try to mail you one.  All right, cool.  It might be a little squat, but...  Well, if they got to hand stamp it, obviously.  Yeah.  Can't put a banana through the machine?  No, I don't think so.  All right, thanks.  Okay.  Cool.  Bye.  Bye.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and we're joined by the Goo Goo Dolls.  Yes.  They are here.  We got Robbie and John.  How are you guys?  We're doing good.  Welcome back to Boston.  Nice to be here. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, wait, they got the reverb on your voice.  You guys can hear this.  Nice to be here in Boston.  It sounds like you're in a big gymnasium.  We have Dwight and Wright.  Oh, there it is.  This is how it sounds when the Pope talks.  There you go.  Wherever he goes, he's got reverb on his voice.  Did you see that on TV?  Can I have more toilet paper?  Yeah, the Pope wasn't looking good on TV at all.  Well, he's 140.  In Pope years.  Right, he used to be...  I don't know what that is.  That's 47.  He used to be the young, vibrant Pope.  Now he's a real old man.  The old Pope. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  He is a real old Pope.  You know, I just want to know if his vestments and Pope hat are bulletproof.  Nobody's in that huge, bulletproof fish ball.  Yeah, the Popemobile.  It's like a converted AMC Pacer.  Yeah, it's got that big glass thing.  The new 1996 Popemobile.  Right.  With driver, passenger, and Pope side airbag.  Pope side.  So how was your summer?  What did you guys end up doing this summer?  We played about 100 shows this summer.  Wow.  And that was nice. 
[00:02:30]  So you didn't get back to Buffalo, I would assume, huh?  For four days.  Four days here, three days there.  Right.  So that was about it.  Did you hear about the jet ski guy in Buffalo?  Oh, going up to the falls.  Was it Stan Jetski?  He lived down the street before?  Stan Jetski.  The dude trying to do the falls in a jet ski.  Oh, yeah.  He had his parachute apparatus that failed to open, and he got crushed.  That's what everybody from Buffalo knows about, other people in the country.  We hear about the guys in the jet ski, but people that live in Buffalo hear about the 
[00:03:00]  guy that tried in the paper bag every week.  There's nobody else.  They're throwing themselves off the falls.  We talked about this on the radio when I was living there for about two and a half  years.  There was a guy that kayaked the falls.  Yeah.  He was nuts, and he, you know, he was, no, he wasn't planning on making it.  That's how he wanted to die.  He kayaked the falls.  I'm out of here, man.  I'm going to get in this kayak and kill myself.  That's so weird.  We have a friend who took handfuls of drugs and actually stood on the edge of the falls  one night with water rushing past his ankles. 
[00:03:30]  Cool.  Not cool.  Not cool.  Give that a whirl.  That's a rush.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, congratulations on the success of the CD.  It's about time people are discovering the Goo Goo Dolls, huh?  In case you don't know, this is us clapping for ourselves.  Right.  A boy named Goo.  And you guys got your guitars.  You want to jam a song real fast for us?  Yeah.  We're going to jam the big single, and I hope that we don't scare America when we give 
[00:04:00]  them our next single, because it doesn't sound anything like this.  All right.  The Goo Goo Dolls.  And even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away. 
[00:04:30]  It's all the dreams you never thought you'd lose.  It's all the dreams you never thought you'd lose.  Tossed them on the way.  Letters that you now meant to send.  Tossed them thrown away. 
[00:05:00]  Now we're grown up  Because I never knew  That leaves  So for long  To no one  That's the same  You could hide  Beside of me  And live for a while  And I won't  Tell no one  Your name 
[00:05:30]  And I won't  Tell no one  Your name  The stars are souvenirs  You never lose  The past is never far  Did you lose yourself  Somewhere out there 
[00:06:00]  Wish you'd get to be a star  Don't it make you sad  To know that life  Is more than who we are </pre>
