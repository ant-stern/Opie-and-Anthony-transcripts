<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Monster Magnet and Mark Terry concert tickets, followed by crude jokes about a recent FHM photoshoot.  Opie recounted a miserable Mets game experience involving rain and long concession lines, prompting callers to share their own offensively-described tales of fellow Mets fans, particularly those wielding large umbrellas. The conversation shifted to Jay Moore's upcoming *Regis and Kelly* appearance, rife with speculation about potential awkwardness and scandal, interspersed with offensive jokes.  They also criticized *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* for preemptively announcing winners. A caller then recounted a humorous anecdote about a botched massage parlor sting on *The Job*, involving Adam Ferrara's discomfort, leading the hosts to arrange a call with Ferrara.  They then promoted upcoming segments including a whipped cream bikini contest with a Jersey Shore trip as a prize, Dice Clay’s upcoming appearance, and ongoing issues with Kenny.  The show ended with a discussion of Christina Aguilera on *Blockbuster Words* and an offensive song about the Special Olympics, with Kimmy from *Survivor* and Allison ("best ass winner") slated to appear later.

A brief mention of the Ron and Fez show and a penis-size joke preceded a commercial break punctuated by an on-air mishap with a remote contributor, Chris, who was initially unaware he was live.  After the break, the hosts discussed Planet Java iced coffee, specifically the high-caffeine "Tremble" variety, before announcing in-studio guests Andrew Dice Clay and Kimmy from *Survivor*, teasing Kimmy’s past promises to flash them.  Caller Zach promoted the UPN reality show *Chains of Love*, sparking a sexually suggestive discussion about the contestants' intimacy and bathroom breaks, met with skepticism and humorous back-and-forth from the hosts. Jennifer called to express her disdain for the show, followed by Suzanne, who described chasing the "Wow Mobile" to flash for the hosts.  The hosts then fantasized about more outrageous reality show concepts, involving nudity, bodily functions, and even potential harm.  A listener offered Britney Spears tickets, prompting a discussion of the "Mommy, what would you do...?" segment, playing a clip of a previous winner firing a bottle rocket from her vagina. This led to a similar contest for NSYNC tickets.  Kimmy's arrival was punctuated by jokes about her difficulty finding the studio, followed by a fifteen-year-old "Team Slut" member inquiring about the whipped cream bikini contest, triggering a discussion on age appropriateness.  Further inappropriate conversations, sexually suggestive topics, and humorous anecdotes continued until Andrew Dice Clay's arrival.

The next segment featured Andrew Dice Clay, Jim Norton, and Kimmy as guests, dominated by highly sexually charged and vulgar conversations. Dice Clay's oversized pants became a recurring joke, alongside sexually explicit commentary on Kimmy's appearance and *Survivor* experience.  Dice Clay's attempts to interview Kimmy for a potential CBS segment were a major part of the discussion, alongside numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendo, often referencing specific sexual acts.  A listener call interrupted, followed by an appearance from "Stalker Patty," adding to the sexually charged atmosphere.  A discussion about a limousine company sponsorship further fueled the sexual jokes.  The segment concluded with more sexually explicit commentary and a heated moment between Dice Clay and Anthony.

The final segment opened with Dice Clay recounting a bizarre underwater fight with a Frenchman.  The conversation then jumped between "Pinnacle Monkeying Around" (a libido-enhancing supplement), offensive jokes about Bing Crosby's alleged child abuse, a recurring gag about "Bad Back Blumberg," Dice Clay's Westbury Music Fair performance with Jim Norton, and a prolonged, sexually suggestive interaction with a female guest, her mother, and daughter, involving vulgar descriptions and encouragement of provocative actions.  The hosts made numerous sexually explicit comments and suggestions regarding various sponsors, including Sam Adams and Harley Davidson.  The segment included Kimmy, Allison and her daughter, and Deb DeDyke (from Island Tattoo) as guests. The show maintained its highly sexually explicit humor and vulgar language throughout, with constant interruptions and tangents. An attempted "big finish" involving physical contact between Allison and her daughter was unclear, ending with more off-color remarks and plugs for Dice Clay's show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.P. Anthony.  This is a God-given talent to be this stupid and this funny and this filthy.  First off, right off the bat, I want to get out some tickets, Anthony.  Yes.  Then played Monster Magnet, Space Lord.  I heard that.  How was the segue? 
[00:00:30]  I missed it.  It was really good.  I was taking a leak.  It was sweet.  Mark Terry before the Monster Magnet, of course.  And both those bands play Monday night at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  We got a pair of tickets to join us at the show.  Join us in the O&A Skybox.  And you get to meet and greet O&A.  The band.  Oh, sorry.  Tenth caller gets a pair of tickets.  212-757-1027.  Take your bra off and check it out now.  Nice head, Zeke. 
[00:01:00]  Whoa, calm down, home.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  What the hell were you thinking?  Your balls are hewing.  Cancel your appointment. 
[00:01:30]  I thought I told you to shut up.  I got sort of a kind of one.  Yeah, it's the O&A show.  Hey, there.  A little dragon today.  Well, we had a...  Here comes the abuse. 
[00:02:00]  Woke up pretty early this morning.  We woke up early.  Because we had a...  I hate saying this word.  Well, Anthony, we had a photo shoot.  It was a photo shoot.  Hey.  A couple of faggots.  We were hanging out in a loft in Soho.  Yes.  Having our little photo shoot. 
[00:02:30]  Howdy, faggot.  You're a girl.  Big loft.  Sipping espresso.  Oh, that's nice.  Beck playing in the background as they did their photo shoot.  Photos.  Photos.  What was that for?  FHM Magazine.  There you go.  I think the July issue, Anthony, I think?  Yes, the July issue.  You know how magazines work, though?  If it's the July issue, it came out last month.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  I think it's coming out on newsstands sometime in June, early June.  Ah.  And we're going to be in Brill Content.  We don't know when, though.  They did that article.  It seemed like a year ago.  I think it's coming out next month, but I'm still waiting to hear back from the guy.  Yeah, maybe someone from Brill Content can help us out with that.  We don't know.  Uh-huh.  But we did this really cool photo shoot today.  What?  Sorry, I was yawning.  I am so not used to getting up that early.  I know a lot of people do it, and, you know, I used to do it. 
[00:03:30]  Wait.  Tell everyone what time you got up so they can just yell at their radios.  Hey.  This is early.  I'm just saying.  It's a brilliant perspective for our...  Relative.  ...for our hardworking listeners.  Yeah, right, Ben.  It's all relative before you start bashing me.  You think 8's early.  You need to wait.  I got up at 8 o'clock in the morning.  What?  I had to get up at 8.  Now, it's all relative because I didn't get to sleep until 3.  I went to the fine Mets game last night. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, but knowing you have to be up by 8, why would you go to bed at 3?  Because that's the time I go to bed.  It's not like I could go to bed and go right to sleep.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  I'm kind of used to these hours, but then when I got to get up at 8, holy mother of God,  I'm drag-assing.  That Mets game sucked.  You know when it sucked more?  Sitting out in the rain watching it.  Try sitting there in the rain watching the game. 
[00:04:30]  When you told me you were going to the Mets game last night?  Yeah.  And it was raining like it was after the show?  Yeah.  I'm like, what is this guy doing?  He's going to be stuck in traffic for an hour.  He's going to get to the stadium.  It's going to be raining on him, and he's going to turn around and go home.  I'm really surprised that you stuck it out.  I had to be there because when I'm there, the Mets will lose.  That's what happens.  So I'm a team player.  It's too early for that crap.  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  And it's not too early to yell,  Yankees.  And then, you know, you see a bunch of the Yankee fans. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  They give you that nod.  Oh, yeah.  And then they're, you know, the big let's go Mets.  They put on the...  There you go.  How you doing?  Hey, common news.  What's Anthony doing at the Mets game?  He's making sure they lose.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, and it's raining.  And they can do the let's go Mets.  Let's go Mets.  I'm just saying let's go home.  Let's go home.  Let's go home.  It was pouring.  Well, you said that the game ended at, what, 9.15?  It was one of the fastest baseball games I'd ever been partied to.  Swear to God.  All of a sudden, it's like, oh, it's the ninth inning, and it's before 9 o'clock.  I think it was five hits total, right?  I know it was one hitter, but I think the Braves got four hits.  Chipper knocked one out. 
[00:06:00]  Larry.  Chipper.  Larry.  And then it was pretty fun, though.  Did you see the bottle hit John Rocker or almost hit him?  Something, yeah.  Okay, flying out.  I saw that.  That was cool.  That's in the news today.  They arrested some, I think it was a 17-year-old kid or something.  Yeah.  He threw a water bottle, I believe.  Yeah, yeah, I saw it.  They didn't even come close to him.  Jesus Christ.  At least I've better aimed.  Where was Rocker?  In the bullpen or already on the mound?  I think right when he was coming out.  Oh, really?  Which was really fun to watch because I'm sitting there, and they call Rocker out, and he's 
[00:06:30]  running, and all I'm thinking is the Brewer bit that he does of John Rocker running.  It looks just like him.  I'm laughing my ass off.  And, of course, the people that have left at Shea, not many, I'll tell you, the weather  was just awful, were booing, booing.  And I'm like, that man's a hero.  That man's a hero.  He'll look at me like I've got three heads.  And then, okay, come on.  He closed it out.  What are you going to say? 
[00:07:00]  What are you going to say?  No one will doubt that he's a good relief pitcher.  Yeah.  And then there's a bunch of new names on the Mets you've got to get used to.  Chang, fang, fang.  Chang, fang, fang.  Can't pronounce half the guys.  Oh, in Japan, that is a home run.  Here, it's called pop out.  Your fear is too big.  I don't even have the strength to start this.  I'm on it.  It was fun.  I'm on starting the Met Yankee thing this early.  I just, I'll wait for that first, you know, quote, subway series thing. 
[00:07:30]  I want to go to the stadium, catch me a real ball game.  We're going to soon, I believe.  Yes, I do believe so.  Let's go to Drew.  Drew, first call of the day.  What's going on, Drew?  Yeah, man, I was at that Met game, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It sucked.  You know why it sucked?  Why?  Well, yeah, the game lasted about an hour and a half, which is probably a good thing.  But anyway, Shane Stadium sucks.  It was raining.  They got nobody working there.  You guys are probably sitting down in the boxes, right?  You all big shots now? 
[00:08:00]  Big shots?  Yeah.  I got my tickets from Finger Bang from the message board.  I'm a big shot.  Well, anyway, I was up there.  We had to run underneath the damn thing because it was raining.  I saw about four innings.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Drew, I got to back you up, too, here.  Back you up.  Big shots don't go to the games.  Right.  Where do they go?  They just don't go.  They don't go.  Yeah?  They're too cool for the play.  I was sitting down front, and I had the option to go up top because a lot of people left,  and no, I wanted to sit up front. 
[00:08:30]  One guy was so pissed off.  This guy gets up right in front of us a few rows, and he's all pissed.  He's yelling,  I'm in front of my face.  Gets up, he goes,  $45 a seat.  I got a stare at a god-effing umbrella.  Somebody in front of him had this huge umbrella.  Who has the balls open up on the umbrella?  Get yourself a goddamn slicker.  Put the umbrella down like they're the only people in the goddamn park.  You want to smack them.  I swear to God, I would buy an umbrella just so I could sit in front of him and pop it open. 
[00:09:00]  See, that's the difference between Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium.  I'm a huge Met fan, but I have to say it.  If you pull that same trick in Yankee Stadium, you could die.  Oh, yeah.  But for some reason, we tolerate this crap at Shea Stadium.  They were selling the poncho.  It's where family are in.  Ponchos, ponchos, ponchos.  And I'm looking at the ponchos.  They've got the big Met logo on the back.  I said, thank you.  I'll stay wet.  I'll stay wet.  She just brought a hefty bag.  Does the same thing.  Oh, that always looks good. 
[00:09:30]  One guy had a shopping bag over his head with a little hole cut out in front.  There's the look you want to go for.  There it is.  We just ended up getting wet.  I didn't care.  We were sitting there.  There's french fries and the beer, and I'm cowering over them to keep the water out.  And that was it.  It was cold.  I just hate watching baseball that way.  I can watch football in those conditions, but baseball?  No, I'll tell you. 
[00:10:00]  We stayed for the whole game.  It was short.  We didn't get there until, I don't know, fifth inning.  And then by the time we got off of the concession line, ooh, they are so speedy there at Shea.  I got to tell you.  And it just doesn't matter what line you go on.  It doesn't matter.  I'm convinced.  I'm convinced they got people watching for when I get on the line.  Anthony, he's on line number three.  Slow it up.  Slow it up.  But line number two and line number four go real fast. 
[00:10:30]  And then you move.  Then the big order is right.  Slow that fun.  Yeah, right.  He's on the move.  Right, right, right.  That's good.  KC, what's going on?  KC, let's go.  Hey, what's up, faggots?  Hey.  You guys still wearing your makeup?  From the photo shoot?  Exactly.  No makeup.  Hey, let me ask you a question, man.  So you can't go to sleep, right?  You can't go to sleep when you want to, right?  Yeah.  Why don't you smoke some AK-47, man?  It'll put you right to sleep.  It doesn't smoke the pot anymore.  I don't smoke weed.  Man, you got to do it, man. 
[00:11:00]  Everybody does it.  Don't smoke the weed.  The weed, man.  Psycho Mark.  Let's Psycho Mark.  I call him on, man.  You need to supply the AK-47, buddy.  All right, KC.  Thank you.  All right.  Shout out to Rose, yo.  All right, yo.  You got it, yo.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I was at the home opener on Monday, and they did the moment of silence for Tommy Agee  and for Brian Cole, the other kid that died who was in the minor leagues.  Yep.  Dead silent.  All the players are on the field, and some guy next to me yelled, 
[00:11:30]  Hey, Rocker, you should have effing died.  Oh, God damn.  Let me tell you, it was so quiet.  You could have heard this guy from, like, all of Queens, and I was just like, oh, my God.  Wow.  What was the reaction around you?  Well, it was, like, very silent, muffled laughs.  Like, no one really wanted to laugh, but you kind of hear people go, oh, my God.  Did you really say that?  That's great.  All right, guys.  Later.  I just don't understand how you pop a goddamn umbrella at a ball game.  I don't get it.  That takes balls.  No, that doesn't even take balls, because it's not the person with balls.  Like, I'm going to do it. 
[00:12:00]  It's stupidity.  No.  It's inconsideration.  And it's these people that think they're the only people in the world.  That's what I mean.  That takes balls to think you're that important.  I don't know.  I don't see it.  I think balls would be like, you know something?  F everyone else.  I'm not getting wet.  I'm popping the umbrella.  That's balls.  This is, oh, I'm getting wet.  Let me open my umbrella.  Not even thinking about people behind them or anything.  That's not the small umbrella.  Dude, this umbrella, it was covering a whole box.  Swear to God. 
[00:12:30]  It was huge.  Same umbrella you use to cover your picnic table when you're having that barbecue in the summer?  Right.  A beach umbrella.  A beach umbrella.  It's a huge umbrella.  Yeah, the head umbrellas, I could deal with that.  You could kind of see around that.  It looks stupid as hell, but at least you're being considerate.  This guy was so pissed.  Mother of God.  Boy, fuck out of that guy.  I want that umbrella.  By the way, can we remind everyone in the city to keep the umbrellas up, please?  I don't want to lose an eye.  Oh, yeah.  Well, hold them high.  Asians.  Asian women, I swear to God, are ruthless with their umbrellas. 
[00:13:00]  Walking down the sidewalk, they'll see you coming.  And they'll pop your eye right out with the side of it.  And they're short, you know, Opie.  So what you got is it's at eye level.  Well, they got the short legs and the flat ass.  Yeah.  And then they can't see you coming because of the eyes, I guess.  Right?  Yeah, the peripheral vision is a little weird.  Peripherally, they can't see you. 
[00:13:30]  Peripherally is what I'm thinking, really, if you think about it.  Lewis!  Okay, now let me get this straight.  Anthony's complaining.  Now, far be it for me to pick on you guys, but Anthony's complaining.  Yeah, far be it, Lewis.  You want to play this game?  Anthony's complaining about being a big guy.  Being up at 8 a.m.  Oh, I've got to be up at 8 a.m.  I can't take the pressure.  What time do you go to bed at night, homo?  3 o'clock, Lewis. 
[00:14:00]  3 a.m.?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He has to be up after only five hours of sleep.  What about the rest of us who work for a living, you fake?  You don't work.  Lewis, you don't work.  Lewis, you call every radio show here.  When do you have time to work?  Hey, Lewis.  When do I call every radio show?  I call your show.  I've heard you on other shows.  Let's not fake it.  Hey, Lewis.  Mm-hmm.  When Spaz left this station, did he take his sense of humor with him?  Because I swear to Christ, any call you have made since he left has been probably the most 
[00:14:30]  unfunny crap I've heard on this side of Vinnie the Racist's act.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You're pumping up all night for your pictures, Anthony?  You know, getting all buff?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's good.  You want to try another one?  That guy-less smile?  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  That's Opie, the guy-less smile.  Well, that was before I got angry.  I've changed my smile.  You'll see in this photo shoot.  Anything else, Lewis?  Okay, I guess this call sucked.  Let's try again next time. 
[00:15:00]  I thought I had you, but I blew it out of my ass right there, right?  Okay.  At least you're honest with yourself, Lewis.  Okay.  I still love you, though.  Mm-hmm.  I wouldn't take your call if I didn't.  All right, man.  Take care, dude.  Bye.  Michael, what's up?  Jesus.  Yeah, what's up?  He's trying ponderous.  Michael.  Yes, O&A.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, yesterday when my friend gave me the, you know, he got extra tickets and everything.  He got them for free.  And yesterday when he showed me where the tickets were, I was like, oh, this sucks.  Where the upper level, row V, which is basically the top of the stadium. 
[00:15:30]  The only thing above us is the pennant flag.  But when it started raining and we had the little overhang cover, then I realized that maybe these seats aren't so bad.  Hey, can I tell you something?  It got real full up there.  Yeah, can I tell you something about those seats?  You know, you want to be a hardcore fan and sit that high up.  You know, there's only one reason you should be sitting that high up, and that's because you're getting a Hummer in front of everyone.  Is that it?  No, that's not it.  He just got them free from some teacher guy.  No, I'm just saying.  I understand you accepted those tickets. 
[00:16:00]  You sat in the rain way up there.  There's no reason to.  I'd rather stay home and watch it on TV.  There's only one reason to sit that high, and that's to go get a Hummer.  Is that the reason?  Yes.  Also, one other thing about the concession stand, Anthony's right.  Two of our friends went to go get some hot chocolate or whatever because it was so freezing last night, and they left at about the middle of the second, and I said, you know what?  Watch them not come back until about the sixth, bottom of the sixth.  Lo and behold, when do they come back?  Right at the beginning of the bottom of the sixth inning. 
[00:16:30]  It was unbelievable.  Just waiting.  I swear to God, we were there for an hour on the line, and we got on that line because it was the short one.  I think there were only four people in front of us.  They moved like molasses, and then if you ask them for, let's say, a burger.  Well, what was I going to get?  A burger, a pretzel, and some fries, and some beer.  They get, as she's waiting for the burger, she's fixing napkins and stuff.  It's like, spend this time getting the pretzel and the beer and the fries as she's waiting on the burger and doing nothing in the meantime. 
[00:17:00]  And if they were that smart, they'd be working for IBM instead of helping you at Jay Stadium.  Yeah, that's right.  That's why when the recession really kicks into high gear, we'll see these bad employees let go, and then we can filter back down.  See, there's too many people working, so the slobs that are normally on welfare, they have jobs now.  What?  It's true.  The people that are normally on unemployment, all of a sudden, jobs opened up at Shea or at McDonald's or somewhere else. 
[00:17:30]  Because the people that were working at Shea and McDonald's, the jobs opened up on a level a little above theirs.  See, the economy's good.  What about the businesses where they have, like, middle management, Anthony?  They got a little better.  And the people in middle management went up to mid-upper.  See, but now when you get the recession, it all falls back down again.  The people that got laid off from the kind of good job they had now go back to McDonald's.  But they're a little more competent because the people that should be on unemployment, there are people that should be on unemployment. 
[00:18:00]  I'd rather pay, with my unemployment, the taxes and the money they take out of your check,  I'd rather pay them to sit home if at least I'm going to get good service at a fast food restaurant.  It's well worth the price.  Interesting theory.  Thank you, Opie.  You pay for it anyway.  I'll pay you to sit on your goddamn ass because it's taken up my valuable time.  This can't be true.  Recession.  Financially thinning the herd.  Let's go to Tony.  What up, boys? 
[00:18:30]  Dude, tell me this isn't the most effing annoying thing at a ball game.  You got hardcore fans there, right?  Drinking beers, getting whacked.  And there's always that one a-hole yuppie.  The other night, right, at the rainy game, this guy had a mother-effing tent built around him.  He had everything on him from a laptop, and this idiot has like a waterproof covering on his cell phone.  I can't tell you how many times we were beaming this guy through the whole game.  He had the bullies to try to shush the crowd. 
[00:19:00]  Don't you want to choke these people?  That's a good move.  Also, the big plastic.  Yeah.  And a whole row will put over him.  He's like, hello?  They're not hurting anyone.  Sure they're not.  How do you try to shush a crowd, 20,000 drunk people sitting around him?  Oh, shit, I got an important call.  Ding, right in the head with a pretzel.  People think they're front row at Gallagher.  Oh, man.  With the plastic.  That's funny.  You're at the ball game.  People are behind you.  Congratulations on the photo shoot, boys. 
[00:19:30]  Not going to take pot shots at you.  Well, this was a tame photo shoot compared to the past photo shoot.  Very quick.  Where they had makeup and wardrobe and stuff.  It was just Aunt Nye, a photographer, and someone from FHM Magazine.  That was it.  Looking forward to it, boys.  Have a good one.  They took one shot.  That's all they needed.  Wow.  Still took two hours for one shot.  I don't get that, but okay.  All right.  Whatever it takes.  Hey, let's take a break. 
[00:20:00]  When is Dice getting here?  4.30.  About 4.30 or so.  Is he in Manhattan?  I think he's coming from the island, actually.  Yeah, I think they put him up on Long Island?  Yeah.  Because he's playing Westbury Music Fair this weekend?  Where is he staying?  I'm not really sure.  What hotel?  Let's give it out.  We can find out, man.  We can find out.  Hey.  Who's calling?  Yeah, call me up in my hotel.  I'll personally invite you down to the show. 
[00:20:30]  How you taking?  Medium rare.  Hey.  Hey, what else we got today?  Kimmy?  Kimmy just called.  She's on a train.  So she's heading on into the station.  Nice.  Our friend from Survivor.  Yes.  Yes, Kimmy from Survivor.  We had a wild interview with Jerry yesterday.  Will she be coming on the show live anytime soon?  I don't know if we'll ever have anybody from Survivor again.  Now, see, I know why Deb pulled that from CBS.  Because Elizabeth's going to get kicked off tonight.  And they're thinking Elizabeth's too sweet and innocent for our show. 
[00:21:00]  She'd probably love it.  Are they going to make believe, look, they're punishing us, blah, blah, blah.  Don't make us fake an Elizabeth.  We'll tear her apart even worse.  We'll get some girl on the phone and say to Elizabeth.  Who knows?  Hey, we got Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is so done.  She's so out.  You think?  Yep.  Why?  She's been a bitch?  I don't know.  I don't watch the show.  If you're not following the show, there's only like two left in her tribe, four in the  other.  So it's got to be either of her. 
[00:21:30]  It's a conspiracy thing.  You know, I'm not Kreskin.  It's pretty obvious.  That's a...  Roger's the weaker one.  So they'll be like, eh, we can keep him another week.  We'll get rid of Elizabeth.  And then we'll get rid of Roger.  They have too many of those cliques because of the tribes.  They've got to have an every man for themselves kind of thing.  Well, I think that's what they're going to have to do for Survivor 3.  They're going to have to, you know...  Because once the numbers reword the show from one tribe, it's over, John.  Yeah, because then you wait like a bunch of weeks as they take out the rest of the tribe  and then it gets interesting again.  Yeah, no matter who's like cool or fun to watch on TV, if they're in the wrong tribe, 
[00:22:00]  you're done anyway.  There you go.  Kind of stupid.  And Allison, our best ass winner?  She's going to be coming in.  Okay.  Stopping in.  Where's she bringing her ass?  Her winning ass winner?  Good, good.  And we've got details on our next contest, the bikini...  Whipped cream.  The whipped cream bikini contest.  Mm-hmm.  Starts a week from Monday, I believe.  With fine prizes.  Trips and stuff, right?  Yes.  All right.  212-757-1027. 
[00:22:30]  Give us a call.  Hey, this is John Velby.  They call me Dr. Dirty because I'm a f***ing ass.  But you're still listening to Opie and Anthony on 102.7.  N.E.W.  I like him.  I like, I like, small boys.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You are officially out of control.  Agreed.  1-2-7.  N.E.W.  Watch them run. 
[00:23:00]  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool that's diving.  At the Special Olympics.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell. 
[00:23:30]  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball have got to be about the funniest friggin' thing I've ever seen in my life.  At the Special Olympics.  At the Special Olympics.  Verse 2.  Kid with Downs wins the race. 
[00:24:00]  Even though he stood in place.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Olympics.  Around his neck.  Gold medals hung.  Resting on his giant tongue.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  But I kid when I sing. 
[00:24:30]  Cause these games are a beautiful thing.  Okay, really, I'm just avoiding karma cause I know my children could be born crippled and blind and this time I retired, I'll have to spend all my time.  At the Special Olympics.  Bravo.  I feel so guilty, I can't even tell you. 
[00:25:00]  That's pretty, yeah, you should.  Steven Lynch.  He finally added a verse to Special Olympics.  Sending that out to Isabella.  She was having a rough day and needed to hear that.  So there you have it, Isabella.  Isabella.  1027 WNEW.  The phone number, 212-757-1027.  Dice will be in studio by 4.30 today.  Yeah.  If not sooner, Kimmy from Survivor on a train somewhere.  Yeah.  Looks like we're going to have another party today in the studio, Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Also, our best ass winner, Allison, coming in to say hi.  A lot of people writing in about Jay Moore, Anthony.  Yeah, what is this?  It is true, by the way.  I confirmed it.  How is this confirmed?  A lot of people saw it on Regis this morning.  Actually, Jay called my house last night.  He did. 
[00:26:00]  Rob from North Brunswick, New Jersey.  Not sure if you guys heard, but Jay Moore will be co-hosting with Kelly Ripper.  He's co-hosting Regis and Kathy Lee, Regis and Kelly Ripper.  Where's Regis going to be?  I guess he's on vacation or something?  On vacation, they're going to have guest hosts, and Jay's going to do Thursday, next Thursday.  Jay Moore.  That is weird.  I wonder if the big Jew gave him the call.  Jay, you're not going to believe what I got you. 
[00:26:30]  You're filling in for Regis Philbin.  Oh, what?  On the millionaire show?  No.  With Kelly Ripper.  That's going to be a wild show.  Who is he going to...  Like, the guests that are going to be on, he's going to have to be like the nice guy, Jay.  That's right.  Know how much info we're going to get on that show?  Oh, yeah.  Is Gelman really a prick, like everyone says?  Does Gelman go on vacation when this happens?  I doubt it.  Gelman, you come with me.  You're like my cabana boy. 
[00:27:00]  Come over here, Gelman.  Gelman, I've had an ugly movement.  Wipe me, Gelman.  Wipe it.  Speaking of Regis, while we're on this subject, we're going to try to get Jay on the show today  to discuss his little two hosting duties to make it so he does not get the call.  Is that what we're going to do?  If he has any brains, he would not call this show before he does this.  Until it's over?  Yeah.  That's true, I guess.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  They had that guy, he won $2.18 million the other night. 
[00:27:30]  Game show whore.  He's a game show whore, you're right.  He's a whore.  He's a game show consultant?  Yeah.  Who knew this was out there?  This guy consults people on game shows.  And he consulted the last winner they had on Millionaire, which was last July Millionaire.  They've done quite a few shows without any winners.  And then this guy comes and takes me for $2.8.  You know what I want to say about who wants to be a millionaire? 
[00:28:00]  When the show first came out, I watched a lot, like I think a lot of people.  I guess it still does well in the ratings.  It does very well in the Midwest.  But there was a reason why I watched every night.  Because I wasn't sure if that was the night someone was going to be the millionaire.  Yeah.  You know, they kept it under wraps for a while.  Now you know when there's going to be a winner.  Yeah.  And they pretty much start promoting the fact, this week on Millionaire, someone finally wins.  It kind of takes it out of the...  Takes you out of it.  And a big F you to Charles Gibson.  I was watching their stupid morning show. 
[00:28:30]  And they basically said, we're going to have the guy on tomorrow.  He's going to win tonight.  We'll have him on tomorrow.  I'm like, gee, thanks for ruining the surprise.  That totally ruins a game show.  You're not supposed to know how this happened.  You never knew in card sharks if they were going to break 21.  What if they printed that?  Don't go...  Don't take another card.  I know what it is.  $10,000 pyramid.  Oh, you never knew.  Never knew.  The Dick Clark was there and he's telling people...  He tells them afterwards.  He didn't tell them beforehand. 
[00:29:00]  I used to hate when he would sit there so condescending after somebody got through maybe half of the pyramid or even just missed one.  And he goes, okay, don't turn around.  Don't turn around.  Would this have helped?  Tire.  Yeah.  Rim.  Yeah, because I'm smarter.  Lug nuts.  I'm smarter than your...  Wheel?  Yes, see, it would have been Wheel.  If I was your partner, you would have won.  But this stupid mother effer over here couldn't even get it.  He was saying spaghetti and sauce.  That's a good observation.  And I'd hate that because he'd be... 
[00:29:30]  Don't turn around.  Don't...  Don't.  No, watch how easy it is.  Watch how the Dick Clark does it.  Yeah, I want to give it a shot at this.  Son of a bitch.  Of course it's easy for you.  You know what it is.  Plus...  No pressure.  Plus the guy already had a few other clues to go along with what Dick Clark's going to say.  That big thing is spinning around.  The pressure on that show is unbelievable.  But millionaire, you're ruining the show.  Don't tell people that someone's going to win.  No.  And if it's something like what happened this week with the guy winning the over two million...  Yeah.  ...then you just replay the show. 
[00:30:00]  So you get some more, you know, exposure out of it.  Yeah.  Well, why tell us that, you know, you're getting a winner?  That means every...  That means no one's winning tonight.  Mm-hmm.  Because no one has talked about it.  Charles Gibson wasn't hitting that they're going to have the winner on tomorrow morning.  That's funny.  Samantha says, Jay's probably going to try to bang Kelly Ripa pregnant or not.  I wouldn't doubt it.  There's a formula...  Hey, baby.  There's a formula for disaster right there.  Kelly Ripa...  Well, maybe even Gelman. 
[00:30:30]  Kelly Ripa's very new still, very green.  Uh-huh.  She doesn't know how to handle herself by herself yet.  She still needs kind of regions and she still looks to the side to look at Gelman.  She ain't going to know how to handle it.  No.  And if Jay just decides to go with it, I think he will.  It could be some interesting TV.  Be slapping that ass with what we saw in the room movie.  Velvet.  Velvet.  Oh, gosh.  God damn. 
[00:31:00]  I can't wait.  He won't call, though.  Hey, we should do that.  Any way to get tickets for that show?  Send Marco and put him right in the front row.  Howie?  That's exactly what it is.  You've got to find somehow, some way to get Jay Marco in that audience.  Right.  All right.  Later, guys.  That's not a bad idea.  Did you see him just stand up?  Jay, I love you with his little shorts on. 
[00:31:30]  Painter talking on my ass again, Jay.  Whip me with the crop, Jay.  Oh, boy.  Hey.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Rob, you're next on WNAW.  Rob, hey.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's happening?  How's it hanging?  Good.  Listen, last night on the job, hysterical episode.  I loved it from beginning to end, but you guys got to bust Adam's balls because he reined 
[00:32:00]  it.  Yeah, he did reined it.  He reined the whole entire WAC Palace.  Yeah, the whole place was getting Yankee Crankies.  I told Adam how to tell.  Yeah, and then he goes in, he ruins the whole thing.  It was funny, though, man.  I thought you guys were going to be all over that as soon as you came on today.  Yeah, can we get Adam Ferrara on the phone?  That is a good point.  Yeah.  If you didn't see the job last night, they discovered that this massage parlor was given  a little...  Yankee Cranky.  A little, yeah, tug and a rib.  A handy.  A handy.  Gives you a handy with every massage. 
[00:32:30]  So then Dennis Leary goes in, and he was supposed to get the tug, and then they were going to  bust the place, you know, because then they have evidence.  But it was so good that Leary decided, no, no, my boys need to experience what I just experienced.  And they were going in one by one, and then Adam Ferrara's sitting there, all naked and  stuff, which was all real.  Hey, you know what?  Jesus Christ.  And then he ruins it.  You're right.  Opie, I think, because if you notice, it was taking him a long time to complete.  That's what it was.  I think he didn't like it as much as everyone else did. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  He was embarrassed, so he had to wrap the place up.  You've got to get him on the phone, though.  You've got to bust his chops.  Hey, Rick, can we make that happen?  Let's see if we can dig up Adam.  How funny was Lenny Clark last night?  Oh, he was even funnier, because he was on the show first with you guys.  Yeah.  He's becoming one of my faves out there.  It was pretty good last night.  Rob, we'll definitely get him on to talk about that.  All right, boys.  I'll be listening.  You guys talk.  Thank you.  Later.  Joe, what's going on?  What's going on, O'Day?  How are you?  Two quick things. 
[00:33:30]  One, on the, you know how in a lot of contests you can't be an employer, you know, an employee  of people running the contest?  Well, if this guy's like a quiz master, shouldn't it be kind of illegal for, you know, get the  rules for him to be on this show?  No, he doesn't work for ABC, so he's just, he's a consultant.  What he does is he also goes around and organizes those high school quiz bowl things, you know,  like the college bowl stuff.  Yeah, he runs that thing.  I mean, he runs a questionnaire thing.  Yeah, this guy basically plays Trivial Pursuit for a living.  He's a ringer. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  He's a ringer.  He knows, there's probably not a question he couldn't answer.  Let's not forget, too, that he won $27,000 on Jeopardy! in 1994.  He was on Jeopardy! as well.  Game show whore.  And before I get to my big FU, the one other thing is, but I knew he was going to win it,  but when Regis first came on in his little, like, 10-second monologue, you kind of knew  the guy was going to win.  They're like, this guy has already consulted the other guy.  It was kind of like, you know, they never really gassed it up as much as they did this  guy.  It's so obvious. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, they're just wrecking the show, because now, you know, you could watch for the, you  know, I guess they, no, they already said that someone else has won.  Yeah.  Right.  So, you know, someone else is going to win in the next day or two.  What I'm trying to say is, you know, after this guy wins, then you know, no one's going  to win for a while, you know, until they start telling you again.  The other thing is, I'm up on business.  I'm up in Port Tuckett.  You're cutting your own neck of the woods, though.  And I go to this bar, I push you from the...  Borsup!  Borsup!  Borsup!  Borsup!  I go across the street, there's some bar they're coming to go to, you know, I want to watch 
[00:35:00]  the end of the Knick game.  I'm in there three friggin' minutes.  I go to the bathroom, I come out, somebody stole $20 off the bar and my gap leather jacket.  So a big F you to everyone in Port Tuckett.  All right, Joe, thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  It said on the screen you wanted us to talk about the job that was on ABC.  I know.  With Dennis Leary and...  He bamboozled us.  Adam Farrar.  The show was really, really good.  Yeah.  How much does it suck for your pal?  He finally has a hit on his hands. 
[00:35:30]  I know.  Because he's been trying to make it for so long.  He's had pilots.  He's very talented, very funny guy, but he's been in situations that, you know, the show  has just never really went anywhere.  He's finally on a show that's going, and they're going to have this huge actor strike, Sue.  You know what it is, though?  So I honestly think even if they strike, it'll come back, and they won't lose any of the  heat.  There's nothing good on TV.  And this is, you know, a show that's funny.  It's clever.  The show needs to be an hour.  It has that feel. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  That's when you start getting into it.  It's like, oh, it's over.  Okay.  Let's go to Nicole.  Nicole, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to know more information about that bikini contest, because I'm getting married  in two weeks.  Hi, Michael.  He's a UPS driver.  I know you hate UPS drivers, Anthony.  No, I do.  Anthony hates other people more now.  But I wanted some information, because I wanted to come down and do that as, like,  my last hurrah before the big day.  Oh.  This is what we got planned for you ladies, okay? 
[00:36:30]  We're going to have a whipped cream bikini contest.  A week from Monday it starts.  You girls will have a whole week to show up, and we'll supply the whipped cream, and you  guys make fancy little bikinis out of it.  Yeah.  Maybe bring some other accessories from home.  Yeah.  Like sprinkles and cherry pieces.  Things like that.  Sprinkles, cherries.  We'll even supply a lot of that stuff.  And then you decide how you want your bikini made.  Mm-hmm.  And then the best one, you know, we'll put all the finalists up on the website.  You guys know the deal by now. 
[00:37:00]  And the listeners will vote for their favorite.  Awesome.  Awesome.  And we have, I guess we can't announce it yet, but we got some trips.  Uh-oh.  Ben's giving me that look.  Wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Ben, grab the mic.  What's the problem with this contest?  Why do I hear this on the, listen to me in the morning, get a trip to Hawaii?  We have one definite.  All right.  And we have another one on hold.  What's the definite trip?  It's, uh...  See, this will excite the ladies.  They hear where they could go, and then they're going to have to come down.  I don't know where it is.  It's somewhere down on the waterfront, way down on the Jersey Shore, and it's a weekend, 
[00:37:30]  and everything's paid for, and all that stuff.  Where are we going?  Like, Wildwood, New Jersey?  We're setting up.  I can get there.  I can get there myself.  Wait, what's wrong with Wildwood?  Wait, we're setting someone to Jersey?  It's down by Atlantic City, and it's, uh...  It's Jersey.  There's another trip to really take.  Oh, Delaware?  Allentown?  Boston?  They can go to Hershey Park to get coupons off for Great Adventure. 
[00:38:00]  It's not your fault, Ben.  We understand your pain.  Believe me.  Now, is the Jersey trip hopefully not the grand prize?  No, no, no.  They're working on a big grand prize.  What about airfare for that trip?  Do they get to go, uh, you know, down to Jersey in one of those buses with the chance of rolling over there?  Some guy puking and stinking up the whole bus?  All right.  Do you go on a bunch with a bunch of old people going to Atlantic City? 
[00:38:30]  They just drop us off?  This is going to be my big hit.  I'm going to be able to win.  You ever see that?  Why do the old people love Atlantic City so much?  Like, what do you think?  You're going to win the million so-odd dollars?  You're still going to be in the home.  Man, they go there for the free food, and they get the free food, and they're getting the room on at like half price.  And I play the slots.  All right.  Do I need to tell you guys when I'm coming down, or do I just show up? 
[00:39:00]  Just show up a week from Monday, well, basically any time that week.  All right?  Okay, great.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  And, ladies, we'll have updated info on WNEW.com, right, Rick?  As they become available.  But the whipped cream bikini contest starts a week from Monday.  Adam Ferrara on the line.  It's the death bus to Atlantic City.  Either I'll die of old age, or this sucker will roll over.  What skilled drivers they all have.  How many times do you hear us drizzle, and those things slide 80 yards off the side of the road? 
[00:39:30]  It just busted.  The driver dug his own trench so he could go off into a trench.  There wasn't a trench available, but he dug one.  Humid, nice, hot, dry day.  Can't they just put bumpers on the side of that?  They should.  Of that highway.  Thank God those drivers do adhere to all speed limits.  I have never been on an Atlantic City bus that wasn't going.  They do like 90. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, let's keep the pan on the side.  Yeah.  You can see that diesel.  I hate bus rides.  They always scare the hell out of me, man.  Never had a good experience in one of those.  And someone will always take a dump in that little bathroom.  And, gee, the ventilation's great.  It's not like we can smell it all the way up to the front seat.  Forgive me, I had broccoli to op.  I was gambling.  You know what happened is I had some cold yichel this morning. 
[00:40:30]  And that stuff is very gassy.  Oh, God.  I had a loose movement.  Abraham, did you eat the chachach?  I had the chachach.  You know, I told you, don't drink the blach before you get on the bus.  Never, I always stick to chachach, thank God.  Thank God you can digest it.  I haven't had good chachach in years.  I've had the chachach. 
[00:41:00]  Adam Ferrara.  You know, the chachach is very tasty.  Hey, Adam.  Hiya, pal.  Hey there.  A lot of people saying you ruined the job last night.  All the boys were getting the Yankee Crankies and you shut down the place.  You're damn right.  Adam, why couldn't it have been the Puerto Rican?  It's the way it was in the script.  And why didn't you get off?  It's a character.  It wasn't me.  It's a character.  It's a character like Mr. Adam.  I was looking at you on the TV and saying, hey, that's Adam and he can't, you know, perform. 
[00:41:30]  You couldn't do it.  You know Superman can't fly.  You know that, right?  Only on TV.  Right.  I just don't want to crush anything for hope.  And what are you doing with your clothes off on television?  Yes.  See, I was looking at that and I thought, man, I have the complexion of a tuna fish.  When I looked at the show last night, I go, I'm a geisha girl.  Look how white my skin is.  I'm a carton of milk with a limp crank. 
[00:42:00]  I haven't known you as long as I am, maybe six or seven years.  And, you know, why does it take, like, a hit TV show to see you, like, with no clothes on?  Why, would you hope this would happen sooner in our relationship?  No, but it's just strange how, like, oh, whatever.  It's strange.  Why?  Most friends, like, you have for six months, you get the whole view or what?  I'll tell you, I've never seen him with no clothes on.  Well, I'm talking, you know, maybe we should hang out at a beach or something, you know?  Oh, wait, there was that gig up in Poughkeepsie. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, we had to get changed.  Okay, I did see him with, like, in his underwear or something.  There you go.  A little strange.  Yeah, you're the new Sipowicz.  Sip-a-dick.  You're a funny man.  Thank you, my friend.  When are you coming in?  When am I coming in?  I'll come see you soon.  Sure.  What's going on?  I'm just waiting for this to happen.  Because it's a big hit show now.  Oh, okay.  The show's deemed a hit.  It's deemed a hit?  Yeah, it is.  Because it's a hit.  Your mouth to God's ears, because my father keeps calling me up, like, De Niro, did the 
[00:43:00]  ship come in yet?  You could pull in $100 million for a movie deal, and your father would still give you  crap.  I know.  Well, you couldn't hold out for $101?  Yeah, well, he gives you crap, too.  You know, Anthony.  Oh, I know.  Anthony's doing good on the radio.  Yeah, it's because they can't see him.  Yeah.  He's my father by proxy.  I swear to God.  You go over to Adam's house, and his father will treat you like you're his kid.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  What are you doing?  My mother's the optimist.  Take out the garbage.  Yeah.  My mother's the optimist.  Like, Joe, look, the glass is half full.  That glass is half empty.  There's crap floating in the water.  Don't drink it.  You can't trust anybody.  You know what had me laughing the other day?  Wow.  I saw some retrospective on that whole Chambers incident.  Remember that, where he was strangled a girl from Robert Chambers?  Yeah.  And Adam's mother was so...  We used to play poker at the house.  He was so caught...  She was so caught up in that trial that the whole time it was going on, you couldn't 
[00:44:00]  talk to her.  And we would play in poker over Adam's house all the time.  And if you went to ask her anything, what would she say?  Shh.  Chambers.  That's it.  That was it.  She'd shush her way and, like, push her.  And we'd go, stop.  Chambers.  Chambers.  She was talking back to the screen like a black lady.  Yeah.  He did it.  Oh, he did it.  He did it.  He's guilty.  Why is this even happening?  Chambers.  That poor girl, dead in the park, panties around the ankle.  No way to go.  Chambers.  Chambers. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  Hey, did you go on that cruise with your brother?  Sure.  How was that?  It was a lot of fun, pal.  Yeah?  A lot of drinking.  Yeah.  Good food, plenty of it.  Yeah.  And a casino.  What else do I need?  How do you gamble?  You didn't play craps on a boat, did you?  No, why?  Six.  Wave.  Seven out.  I did play roulette, which was a little weird.  Yeah?  And the whole thing is based on a very balanced wheel.  Did you win?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah?  And then blackjack, which isn't affected by waves at all. 
[00:45:00]  I lose regardless.  I was just in Vegas.  There's gambling all over the place.  In the laundromat.  I went in with dirty clothes.  I came out with wet clothes.  I didn't pull the jack.  That's so true.  You go to Vegas, everything.  Yeah.  The gas station bathroom has like a slot machine.  No, you can't get the paper towels unless you hit the sevens.  You need a couple of lemons.  Sure. 
[00:45:30]  Sure.  All right there, Pally.  Good talking to you, champ.  Yeah, great show last night.  Yeah, it really was, Adam.  Thank you.  All right.  Big start.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Hey, we had Lenny on.  We had Lenny on yesterday.  Oh, was Lenny screaming?  He was awesome.  Yeah, isn't he great?  I think we're going to get along just fine when he comes in here.  Oh, yeah.  He's a blast.  All right, boys.  All right there, pal.  I'll talk to you soon.  Cheers.  Later, O.  There you go.  Bye, Adam.  There he is, half naked on TV.  Great.  You know what?  I'll take the abuse. 
[00:46:00]  It just didn't come out right.  What?  I missed it.  I know what I...  Julian, and I'm not even going to try to explain myself because it's just...  I'm just going to bury myself.  Well, I usually not have these.  You caught it.  Julian, go ahead.  Oh, what's up?  You a fag or something?  You want to go to the beach with guys and take out their naked bodies?  Wow.  At least I don't have a girl's name.  I was expecting to talk to a girl.  Yeah, so I got a girl's name.  So what?  At least I'm not a fag.  Hey, Julian.  I'm Julian.  I'm Julian.  So what?  But I'm not talking about running around the beach with naked guys. 
[00:46:30]  You fag.  You a homo.  All right.  Thank you.  You're a sea catcher.  All right.  That's good.  Thank you.  You got me.  There's nothing I can say.  I'm Julian.  It didn't come out right, though.  Oh, brother.  It's just weird to see one of your pals, like, half naked on TV.  But it didn't come out right.  I'm sorry.  Apology accepted.  I don't like the wording of your apology outfit. 
[00:47:00]  You didn't apologize.  You just said you were sorry.  Send it back or the airmen never get released.  Right.  Kimmy should be here soon from Survivor.  Nice.  And a happy face called on Dice's behalf.  Yeah.  And?  He's about 30 minutes away.  They're in a car.  What's the story with Club Soda, Kenny?  Ask Dice when he gets here, but Kenny can't work with him anymore.  I've heard this. 
[00:47:30]  Who's going to call him handsome?  Kenny can't work with Dice anymore.  No.  All right.  In between Westbury Music Fair plugs, I'm sure we might get a story about it.  And I hope happy face doesn't start screaming as soon as he gets in here, because...  Is Norton with him?  I hope so.  Is Norton coming in today?  I hope so.  Because Norton's warming up for Dice at Westbury Music Fair this weekend.  He's going to be funny.  Oh, man.  All right.  Rick.  Rick, Rick. 
[00:48:00]  Rick deals with Dice.  You know what Dice is listening right now?  Are you insane?  Okay.  Put a check mark next to Rick's name.  Someone funny?  Okay.  Okay.  You be funny.  Jake or face?  Oh.  It's a deal.  Oh, my God.  It's been an industrial accident.  Mike, you fall down the stairs.  Guys.  Where are you working?  Mike. 
[00:48:30]  Yo.  Where are you working?  Oh, I'm unloading my truck.  I stopped.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Did you see the blockbuster words last night?  Unfortunately, I did take a little peek at that.  Did you see Christina Aguilera was the funniest thing ever?  With the big afro?  He had an afro like O.J. from Naked Gun when they showed him when he was young, remember?  He had that big old wig on?  God, I got to see that movie again.  No, really.  Her afro was so big, it was unbelievable.  I never say anything like that.  Hey, Anthony thinks she's hot.  She looks horrible. 
[00:49:00]  She looked like John Benet Ramsey last night.  You should have saw her last night with that tiny, thin, like, sickly-looking body with this afro.  Look.  Yeah.  And the makeup is hot.  Wait, wait, wait.  I've got to give the visual to Anthony.  All right.  Afro this big, no joke.  Send me a picture.  This big.  Somebody email me a picture or pop it up on our instant feedback, a link to the picture.  Huge.  She must have looked like one of those dandelions you pick and blow off her.  That's exactly what she looked like.  That's the point.  Okay.  That's a perfect way to, yeah, look like her with the two. 
[00:49:30]  And the color of the hair was just, you know, the same.  I don't care what you say.  She's hot.  She looks like a four-year-old kid.  She's hot.  She looks like John Benet Ramsey.  Remember those?  John Benet Ramsey was hot.  Oh, okay.  Maybe I went too far.  You got problems, man.  Starving Marvin with a huge, yeah, afro.  Starving Marvin.  Hey, it's Blonde Starving Marvin.  All right.  All right, guys.  Later.  Bye.  Hey, we've got to play that Alabama Man commercial.  We said...  Alabama Man!  Let's play the long version as we go to break here, okay? 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Okay, then.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Here it is.  We'll be back.  What?  Hey, kids.  Do you like him, Pokemon?  Yeah!  Then you're going to love Alabama Man.  Alabama Man.  He's quickie from the afternoon.  I take Alabama Man to the bowling alley where he drinks heavily and shoots tobacco.  Yeah.  He's a bull.  He's a bull.  He's a bull.  Alabama Man.  His wife asks him where he's been. 
[00:50:30]  Just use the action button.  Alabama Man bust her lip open.  Yeah, bitch.  Wow.  He's a boy.  He's a boy.  I want to be just like Alabama Man.  Alabama Man comes with everything you see here, wife.  So, separate.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Not all people from Alabama are white beers.  Opie.  I'll be honest.  I'm an ass.  What can I say?  Could you please get those two jerks out of here? 
[00:51:00]  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.  Fez, it says here that in extremely windy conditions, the Empire State Building has a gift of 1.48 inches.  Now I'm jealous.  About what?  Even the Empire State Building has given more inches than I do.  You're talking about your own lack of endowment again, aren't you? 
[00:51:30]  But, Ronnie, it's so small and helpless.  Remember to go online to ronandfez.com to compete for $10,000.  From Ron and Fez, now in Midday.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027.  WNEW.  That dress is cut down to the stinky place.  Hey, Chris, real fast.  We're in the middle of commercials.  Chris.  Yeah?  Real fast.  We're in the middle of commercials.  All right.  Dick! 
[00:52:00]  Chris?  Chris?  Chris?  Yes?  What are you waiting for?  Oh, I'm on the air?  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Not anymore.  I'm on a cell phone.  I can't really hear you.  Hey, Anthony, did you notice that Christina Aguilera looked just like Guy Schneider?  Yes.  From Twisted Sister. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you, Chris.  Should have taken three seconds.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Finally, iced coffee just got cool.  We're drinking the stuff like crazy in the back room.  Yes.  You might have seen the trucks.  They're cruising the tri-state area, giving out free samples.  The packaging is really cool and edgy.  Mm-hmm.  I got to say it.  It's better than the Starbucks iced coffee.  Hell, yeah.  Without a doubt.  They're pushing three flavors, Anthony.  You want to tell them about it?  It's a javadelic.  It's a grown-up milkshake.  The perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee. 
[00:53:00]  Then they got the Karamocha chocolate caramel in a coffee.  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  It's a great mixer, too.  Sure.  A little Kahlua in this thing.  A little vodka.  Ooh, nice.  Right?  Nice.  Nice.  And, of course, tremble.  I need a little tremble today.  Need something, an extra kick in your day?  Something to give you an extra kick?  121 milligrams of caffeine.  That'll do the trick.  Tremble's the highest caffeinated drink in the country. 
[00:53:30]  Is this stuff legal?  So if you're a student or trucker, mom, anyone who needs a boost, tremble's going to do the trick for you.  I highly recommend the tremble.  Yes.  Be yourself with Planet Java iced coffee with an attitude and available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, go in there and say, hey, get some Planet Java.  Iced coffee just got cool, and it's called Planet Java.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Envy.  Proving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island. 
[00:54:00]  This is 1027 WNEW.  Minutes away from Andrew's Ice Clay in studio.  Minutes away from Kimmy from Survivor in studio.  Yes.  She promised she would flash us the next time she came in here. 
[00:54:30]  Ah, that's right.  We would get a wow from her.  Or did she say only if she was in here on a Wednesday?  This is such a cop-out.  She's showing something today.  Yeah.  We'll see a little something.  Come to think of it, though, she's already shown something.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And a few hundred of you have already seen that something.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Yeah.  And that's all I'm going to say about that for now.  A few hundred?  A few thousand, probably, I would say. 
[00:55:00]  Probably.  Zach.  Yes.  It's Opie and Anthony, and you're live in New York City.  All righty.  Hello, Zach.  Hello.  I was actually holding to talk to Rick.  Yes.  Well, what do you got?  I wanted to see about bringing Andy Dillon, the picker from upcoming show Chains of Love.  Andy who?  Andy Dillon.  Andy Dillon.  Upcoming picker from the show Chains of Love, April 17th.  Oh, Chains of Love, another reality show.  Yeah, on UPN.  Ah. 
[00:55:30]  And I wanted to have him come on and talk about his experience on the show and the women  that were chained to him and how he subsequently let him go.  UPN, getting into the act now.  Wait, so he's the guy that has the broads chained to him?  Yes.  Four girls chained to him periodically, eliminates him over four days.  And each time he eliminates them, he gives them cash.  He has a $10,000 cash pool to work with.  And when he cuts them off, he gives them a certain amount of however much money he wants  to build up they deserve or are worthy of.  Can they give him an immunity BJ? 
[00:56:00]  Is that how it would work?  I don't think that happens on this particular one.  That would be interesting.  Imagine the immunity BJ.  Right.  Like the first chick that gives him one in the morning cannot be voted out that day.  Well, I think that would probably work for their favor.  He'd be having his knob hobbed at 1201.  Hey, Zach?  Yes.  You're obviously promoting this for UPN?  I'm working.  We work.  Yeah, I'm working alongside with UPN.  You tell me why we should watch this show.  That's a good way to put it. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Give us a little sell-asson.  Because, I mean, let's face it.  There's reality shows out the A at this point.  Well, I think the reason why you're on, you should watch the show, because I think it's  great to watch a guy chained to four girls, periodically release them, and kind of be  cocky and arrogant in the meantime, showing the girls who's boss and having four girls  chained to them.  Name one person in your listening audience who wouldn't want four beautiful women chained  to them.  You're not doing a good job, Zach.  Now, how long does it take to unchain the girls?  The actual unchaining process takes about 10, 15 seconds. 
[00:57:00]  No, I mean, but how many days does this thing go on for?  Oh, four days.  It's only four days, this show?  This show, each episode is one day.  It's over four days, and it's into one episode.  So, each episode of the sixth, there'll be new contestants each time.  Oh, so like every week or so?  Yeah, every Tuesday, you'll get a new guy and a new batch of chicks.  Well, in the next week's episode, you'll have a girl chained to four guys.  Wait, does this show start already?  It starts on April 17th. 
[00:57:30]  And I'm not getting, what are they, just in a room?  No, they're in a huge mansion down in Palos Verdes, California.  All right.  How are they actually chained together?  They are chained.  Andy will be chained to, the girl on his left is chained to his wrist, and the girl on the  left is then chained through her ankle to another girl, and the girl on the right is  chained by the foot, and then she is then chained to the girl to her right by her wrist.  And, um, how do they do things, uh, like personal things? 
[00:58:00]  Um, they have personal time during the day to, uh, when they have, when nature calls,  they have to go to the bathroom.  They have to go to the bathroom.  So you unchain them so they can take a little duty?  You, uh, wait a minute, you, you, I don't like that part of it yet.  You almost had me.  God damn it.  Why can't you guys go the distance?  Look, I could tell you all about it and sell the show to you, but what you gotta do is  you have to have Andy come on and tell him about his personal experience with the girl.  He kissed, so he didn't kiss.  You lost, you lost, I was, I was kind of getting like, all right, if, if they have to all go 
[00:58:30]  into the shower, or all go into the bathroom, and this guy takes a crappy dump and is disgusting,  and these four chicks have to sit through it, that's gonna make for some good TV.  Well, the girl's gotta change her pun or something.  You know, I'm in for the long haul, but you, you let him go?  And you want him on our show to talk about how he kissed them?  Because he kissed some of the girls who he kissed and who he didn't?  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna send you guys a review copy.  You guys take a look at it. 
[00:59:00]  I think you guys are gonna want him on this show, and if you want him on this show to  talk about it, we'll bring him on.  Our reality show quota has been met.  The clock's ticking on the reality show.  We've been, we're into the boot camp, we're into the Temptation Island, we're into the  Survivor, of course.  Temptation Island was even pushing it.  We were getting pretty damn pissed off at that because nothing was happening.  So, why, why did you let him go?  Well, who made that decision, Zach?  That decision wasn't, wasn't made by me.  Would you have made that decision?  You let him go? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, for bathroom breaks and showers and, uh, pond breaks and stuff.  Oh, I don't know.  I haven't really thought about it that much, to be honest.  I haven't thought about it.  It's probably the most important part of this whole thing.  Hey, Zach, I think you have a bomb on your hands.  I don't think so.  I think this is the first reality show that's just gonna be a complete disaster.  Damn.  You had me for a second.  Well, why don't you have your audience tune in on Tuesday, April 17th at 8 p.m.  Well, you can get that plug in.  It's not gonna help too much.  They'll check out the first one.  They'll check it out, I'm sure.  Well, when they smell crap, they know it's crap. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Well, help us, Zach.  Anything else?  Are they in lingerie?  Yeah.  The girls?  Hot tub, bikini.  How do they change?  They change separately.  Oh!  So there's no nudity between any of these people?  No nudity, but they're skin.  They all share a bed together.  Does the guy get a little, you know, Yankee Cranky or anything?  Anything going on between these people?  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna send you guys a review tape, let you guys take a look at it for yourself, 
[01:00:30]  so you guys know exactly what we're talking about.  Oh, Zach, we're giving you the shot right now.  We have a huge audience.  You gotta pull us in.  Pull us in with a big sell.  I'm pulling you, I'm pulling you.  You guys gotta put this guy on the show.  He's gotta tell you about what it's like to be chained to four women over four days,  sending him packing.  Wait, wait, we got somebody here that actually saw the screaming.  Hold on.  Torture!  That's torture!  Guys already understand how it is to be chained to a woman. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, believe me.  And if only you could cut the chain and they'd be gone.  And if they got a mother-in-law in the picture, that's two girls that he's chained to.  That's the beauty of what Andy had.  He had the ability to cut them off the ones that he didn't like, sent him packing.  I'm telling you, he's your type of guy.  He's the type of guy who listens to your show.  Any boop squeezes going on?  A lot of making out.  Your show sounds nothing more than the time Rick and Louis Black and Norton got arrested.  With the voyeur chicks. 
[01:01:30]  Same thing.  I don't know.  Only there was nudity.  You know, if you had them all having to go into the shower, all having to figure out how to get their goddamn clothes off and put on clothes that wouldn't have to go through their legs and their arms and things like that, I think you'd have had me.  But the concept of letting them go, I would get some strategically pierced women and chain them that way.  Yeah.  I got a show for you.  You ever hear this one? 
[01:02:00]  All right, guys.  Zach?  Yeah.  Just one final question.  When this show fails, what are you going to do next?  Yeah.  What's next on that?  What's the next thing you're going to be pushing?  Oh, you guys are cracking me up today.  No, we're not trying to crack you up.  Oh.  Oh, so funny.  What the hell were you thinking?  All right, guys.  You have a good rest of the day.  I'm going to get you out those materials. 
[01:02:30]  Look for it on UPN, April 17th, Tuesday at 8 p.m.  All right.  There's the plug.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Sweet, merciful crap.  The reviews are in.  Are you ready?  Oh, ah.  We got the new sports guys promo. 
[01:03:00]  Been lost to sports guy.  Said there's no longer worth the sports guys.  I know.  What, are we going to have to replace the whole morning show or something?  What are we doing here?  We're not going to trash Sid.  He's a really good guy.  Wishing the best.  He likes Sid.  Craig and Blaine, honestly, they got something going on.  So, uh, you'll have to listen to see what you think, okay?  Right.  But this is the new promo for the guys?  Not all people from Alabama are white beers. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Alabama man is, uh, standing in.  He's the newest sports guy?  All right.  How about that?  Jennifer, what's going on?  Hey, it's me, Jennifer, from yesterday. 
[01:04:00]  The first, uh, first wow girl?  Oh, yeah.  I was just passing the same place where I'd called you, and I thought of you, and I was  listening to that moron with no brains telling me about the idiots all chained up.  I'd rather watch my laundry than watch that guy.  Yeah.  Remember him telling you guys that the man's going to tell the girl to his boss?  Ass.  Ass.  Ass.  He's not even worth the toilet paper that I'd wipe my butt with.  They're pushing the reality concept just a little too far.  Oh, please.  Like I said, I'd rather watch my laundry. 
[01:04:30]  Whoa, calm down, ho.  Whoa.  Whoa, calm down, ho.  Oh.  Hello.  Turn that goddamn radio down.  Turn that down.  Oh, my God.  And I got my tickets.  Thank you very much.  All right, Jennifer.  We can't wait.  Are you guys going to be there tomorrow?  Uh, where?  At the, uh, Andrew Dice Clicker.  Oh, yeah, yes.  I, I, I, yeah, I will be there.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Cool.  Thanks.  All right, Jennifer.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, thanks, Dick. 
[01:05:00]  Suzanne, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hello.  We're having fun.  All right.  I have been driving down the BQE chasing the Wow Mobile for 10 miles.  Ah, you dopey ass.  Slow down.  What Wow Mobile?  I know, I was on hold ready to flash, but I realized it's Thursday, not Wednesday.  No, no, you're not listening closely.  This is true, darling.  Ah, it's, it really is whip them out whenever.  We just focus on Wow on Wednesdays.  The guy was going too fast, and then he went off on an exit and I missed my chance. 
[01:05:30]  So, basically what you're saying is,  if you see a car with a Wow sticker or a homemade Wow sign, you will flash today?  Even if he's 82 years old, absolutely.  Nice.  And what road are you on?  Now I'm on the LIE.  What exit about?  Exit about 32.  All right, cool.  Have fun, Suzanne.  You guys are best.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Chains of Love.  I'm looking at the website.  All right, there's Check.  There's some guys. 
[01:06:00]  They're chained together.  They totally missed the mark on that one.  Wouldn't you think?  You've got to have, and UPN is a station that can't afford to, ooh, let's hold back a little  bit here.  They should go balls out.  And it's probably going to be like beautiful people, right?  Beautiful girls chained to a guy.  Not even beautiful girls.  No, no.  It's UPN.  You're going to have, you ever see those girls that are on that, what's that show?  Like, even Blind Date or the other one where you come on with your significant other.  They both go out on dates with someone else. 
[01:06:30]  Right, that is, um.  What, uh, yeah.  Change of Heart.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  These people come on, and they're just this side of good looking.  Like, just that side.  Just over the line.  And the guys are always these douchebags that come out with these fake, like, gang  sign things they're doing with their hands.  Yo, yo, let me tell you.  With the big jams on, and the jams.  That's what it's going to be.  Just described our intern, Jesse, but he's white. 
[01:07:00]  No, that's what it's going to be.  It's just going to be a bunch of tools.  And the whole thing would have been, they're chained together for four days.  Think about it.  The first thing that pops in your head.  I'm not going to watch this show.  The second thing that pops in your head.  If only they were doing personal things.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  The girl's got to put that one leg up on the toilet, like on the instructions for the pond.  Anthony, I think you're even missing it.  The cross section of the chick.  Right.  With her foot up on the toilet.  You ever read the instructions on those things? 
[01:07:30]  No, I never had to.  No.  You ever sit on the ball and you're like, I got nothing to read.  And you just grab the tampon box.  All right.  This is interesting.  Wow.  Look at that.  And you see the little cross section of the uterus.  And the girl's got her foot up on the toilet.  It's on the box like that.  Oh, yeah.  On the inside.  A little paper thing on the inside.  You read the instructions.  It's like, hmm, look at that.  Do you got to put your foot up on the toilet?  You know what this show should do, Ann? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  It's very odd.  Thank you.  Yeah, I was heading down that same road.  Screw like beautiful people.  You get a guy.  You get like a girl that maybe is really hot, but she has AIDS.  You have a homeless guy.  Yeah.  And like a serial killer.  And then you have to decide who you need to, you know, release first.  Who's not watching every week?  See, that's what UPN should be doing.  Enough with the beautiful people on TV. 
[01:08:30]  Get a little funky.  Right?  That would be entertaining.  And that's what UPN.  How about a guy chained with three or four gay guys?  And they all have loaded guns, if you know what I mean.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  How would you handle that situation?  Who do you let out?  Who do you let out?  I think who you let in is more than one.  Who you don't.  That would make it a little more interesting, though. 
[01:09:00]  Hot chicks, one's got the herp.  You got to have sex with one of them.  The last person you vote on.  There you go.  So you have to figure out who has the herp.  Who's got the herp?  And they don't have any physical signs, so you're just taking that chance.  Right.  Rich, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, I think, like, I don't know how many promos on UPN because they just run them every five minutes.  The thing is, like, chains of tools.  It's horrendous. 
[01:09:30]  If they want to make it interesting, like, you know, Chuck Norton on, you know, chain to, like, four or five S&M chicks.  And let them just beat on them all day.  And, you know, whoever complains they need medical attention is out.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  All right.  We can make it more interesting if UPN wants to call us.  We'll give them some ideas.  All right, fellas.  Thank you, Rich.  I'm going to go spank myself on the radio.  All right.  Wang fellas got a good idea here.  What?  Teen chains of O&A.  Chained together 14 girls, and we don't let them take the chains off when they got to go to the bathroom or do a thing. 
[01:10:00]  Teen pajama chains of O&A.  And they have to drink beer the whole time.  Oh, nice.  And they have to, they have to go right here in the studio.  Jesus.  They wear diapers.  Teen tinkle party.  Put them in diapers.  The first one that goes.  Oh, this is horrible. 
[01:10:30]  Well, what are we waiting for?  Get the chains.  Get the team.  Get the pens.  That would be fun.  You want to do that?  We ought to do that.  We'll do our own chains of whatever.  Yeah.  We'll show UPN how it's really done.  The right way.  The most interesting aspect of this, they opted out of.  Pussies.  You get a kid toucher and you chain them to three or four kids.  Oh, God.  Oh, my.  And the parents are, you know, rooting their kids on, saying, hang in there. 
[01:11:00]  We can win the money.  Oh.  You like having your background.  Oh, what?  Four kid touches and one kid?  Oh, God.  Who gets to the kid?  They're all duking it out.  Oh.  Not a bad idea, though, Rick.  Yes.  You get a Klan member and a bunch of black guys.  That wouldn't last long.  But, man, would it make for some great TV?  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  The brain surgeon Klan guy would go, look at all you knockers in chains.  It's just not bubbling at all.  By the way, TV guy, check it in.  ABC is running promos today, saying, we gave away a record amount of money on Tuesday on  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.  See us give away another million tonight.  Thank you.  Prove them the point we made earlier, douches.  Now you know never to watch Who Wants to Be a Millionaire until they tell you, yeah,  tonight's the night that someone's going to win. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Oh, that's good.  Pete from Connecticut.  How about chaining four people to dice, the one who could put up with him the longest  wins?  Got me the key!  We're basically playing that game in about ten minutes.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, 187-WNEW.  Got to break in real fast. 
[01:12:30]  Nancy.  Hi.  Hi.  Who are you?  Nancy, obviously.  Yeah?  I'm 20 years old, and I was really interested in doing that thing with the girls chained  together and not going to the bathroom.  Oh, nice.  Would you wear an adult diaper?  Yeah.  I have amazing bladder control.  All right.  I have a little problem, Nancy.  What?  Kicking the bladder.  I was going to say that, Rick.  Me and you are on today, man.  What were you going to say?  You're going to read it.  Go ahead and read it.  I'm having a slight problem with Nancy's voice. 
[01:13:00]  Why?  It's a little deep.  A little...  Yeah, I have a deep voice.  I used to be a bass and chorus, but I am a female.  Does the body go with the voice is what I guess we're getting at?  Um...  Oh, hesitation.  No, I'm...  No, I'll be completely honest.  Oh.  A carpet naked.  Oh.  What?  All right, go ahead.  Be honest.  Um, I have normal-sized breasts.  I'm a little overweight, but nothing like massive. 
[01:13:30]  Go ahead.  You can laugh.  No.  No.  Stop it.  You're laughing at Alabama, man.  You love the Alabama Bowl.  I love Alabama Bowl.  The fact is, I'm a big fan.  I listen to you guys as much as I am in New York, and, um...  I don't know.  I just thought it would be really fun.  No, I think you're in.  So hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Alabama Bowl.  All right, you guys.  What? 
[01:14:00]  We're on to something.  We're hovering, Anthony.  We're hovering.  We have a really good idea, but we need to hammer it home and the listeners help us with  this stuff.  Something with this concept.  Something with...  Teens.  And chains.  Chains of...  Teens.  Teens.  Lesbian bubble bath party.  Urination?  Teens.  We don't quite got it.  It's close.  It's almost there. 
[01:14:30]  It's really close.  Okay, what's involved?  Teen girls.  Teen girls.  Chains.  Belly shirts.  Teen girls.  Teens.  Chains.  Teen chains of love.  Okay.  They're chained together.  But the thing is, we need something that...  Okay, they're chained together for a long time.  What can transpire in that time that could be fun, exciting, and make us spank it? 
[01:15:00]  All right, we'll think about it.  By the end of the show, we'll have the concept down and we'll be doing it next week.  Guaranteed.  Okay.  Teen chains of...  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Hmm.  Teen chains of...  Oh, gangbangs.  We'll figure it out. 
[01:15:30]  Anthony?  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  I'm expecting Joey Paisano to show up at this station today because Dice is coming in.  Where is Joey?  I don't know.

[01:16:30]  Pick up Hagstrom's new New York City 5-4-0 Atlas wherever maps are sold.  Listen to Ron and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  Ready?  3, 2, 1.  I found out why the government is actually behind the glow-in-the-dark monkeys.  Why?  Because they figure it'll be easier to spot your television leaving your apartment at 6 o'clock in the morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Sorry about this, kids.  Stay tuned.  1027-WMW.  That's Jim Norton, who's warming up for Andrew Dice Clay at Westbury Music Fair this weekend. 
[01:17:00]  Hoping Jim makes a visit to the studio today or tomorrow.  It's always fun.  That would be cool, right?  Yes.  Kimmy from Survivor.  She was on the phone and then someone might have hung up on her.  She thinks we're making fun of her?  What?  She's lost.  Oh, she's lost?  No.  We don't want to make fun of her for being lost because she's a half a block away and  can't find her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, because someone said she was calling in because she thinks we're making fun of her.  We haven't made fun of her today. 
[01:17:30]  No.  She's standing in front of the Russian tea room.  She doesn't know where to go.  The Russian tea room?  I'm not exactly the sharpest knife in the pool.  Hey, don't make fun of her.  God, you're making fun of all our guests, Rick.  You're kidding?  Who's going to want to come by?  You said Dice isn't funny and Kimmy doesn't have a brain.  My God.  What the hell?  Dice doesn't have a brain and Kimmy's not funny. 
[01:18:00]  Tell her.  Tell her.  Hey, guys.  This is Team Slut from the O&A Message Board.  Yes.  Team Slut.  Yeah, I was wondering if there's an age restriction on the whipped cream bikini contest.  How old are you?  Fifteen.  All right, you're in.  Are you insane?  No.  You can't do the whipped cream bikini contest if you're fifteen.  What about the Teen Sains?  No, because it will involve nudity and maybe bodily functions.  I'm not sure yet.  That doesn't bother me. 
[01:18:30]  It bothers the police.  Yeah, you don't.  Trust me, it doesn't bother us either.  That's not, you know.  You doing anything yet?  You involved in that, um, uh, what they call, uh, fooling around?  Oh, it's a fool.  You should check out my post on the message board.  All right.  All right, Jesus.  Nothing but trouble.  We got a pass on you.  Yeah, we definitely have to pass.  Well, what about the Teen Sains you're talking about?  No, because that'll involve things that you can't be part of.  But on the team.  Yeah.  All right.  That's exactly the point.  Eighteen and nineteen, fine. 
[01:19:00]  Fifteen, no.  All right.  We'll go for an Olsen twin.  Sixteen if you have a fake ID.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Uh, Rick, you got some good news for us?  Yes?  Yeah.  Rick, to you.  What's up?  Rick, comment.  Remember, uh, last year, the, uh, the thing we started?  Uh, fire out on the, um, what?  Uh, clothes.  No, this is for, uh, for Britney Spears tickets.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  All right.  Of course.  Yes.  Well, we have, uh, another pair of tickets that a listener has brought us. 
[01:19:30]  Oh.  He's got him.  He's standing outside.  Well, bring him in.  Let's get him in.  Okay.  Okay, his name's Matt.  I heard that.  I heard that.  Rick's wheeling and dealing.  Not in our lobby area.  What's up, Matt?  I'm like.  What's up?  What's up?  Uh, Tenafly, New Jersey.  I am.  Tenafly.  What's up, man?  I'm a board, uh, whack bag kid.  There you go.  Okay.  And, uh, basically, I got an extra two tickets for NSYNC.  Oh!  Stop! 
[01:20:00]  That's like gold for our show.  Be still my heart.  Hey, Kimmy's here.  Holy.  Instinct.  I don't know where you came in.  Oh, Kimmy just came in?  Okay, I'll keep talking.  Um.  Kimmy went to take a crap.  Maybe you could have the same luck you did yesterday with Jeff Hedges.  Go, right?  And, uh, I know you guys like to give away the NSYNC tickets.  Yes.  So, uh.  Can we see the NSYNC tickets?  Yes, you may.  Are they in a good location?  Ah, let's see.  They're in the lower tier.  Opie, I'm holding them.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  NSYNC.  When's the show? 
[01:20:30]  Uh, June.  Don't look at me out.  June, uh, something.  Giant Stadium.  Very good.  Very good.  What's up, Rick?  So.  We gotta learn that a lot.  Freaking bathroom door.  Did you just walk in on Kimmy?  I keep popping up going, I'll pay you!  Nice.  Nice.  No way.  Get her in here.  She doesn't have to wait.  You guys watch the Survivor?  Come on in, Kimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my dear Lord.  Kimmy, did Rick walk in on you?  Yes, he did, but that's okay.  As you were peeing.  I mean, she saw that, like, in my pants, really. 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  Like, my pants is actually, you know, what it, well.  Rick, you're a dog, man.  Why couldn't it have been the guy that would have enjoyed it?  Rick's a dog.  Oh.  No, we're not talking about you.  Hey, who's with the camera?  Who's the camera guy?  What?  CBS.  What does CBS want?  What does CBS want, Kimmy?  What did you get us into today?  I don't know.  CBS.  We're going to document the chaos for everyone to see.  You know, I told you guys to get me back here on a Wednesday. 
[01:21:30]  It's a Thursday again.  It's Wednesday in China.  Right.  Where the airmen flew out of.  So, in respect of them, I think you should show your pants.  Yeah, it's Wednesday somewhere.  Somewhere.  You're just a big talker.  We knew it all along.  I think I'm in my pants.  Kimmy, I wouldn't take that for a second.  Right now, I would flip my shirt up.  Yeah.  If I were wrong.  Hurry, before the cameras get in here.  That's a private show.  He's a big camera. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, my.  So, what are these people doing here?  And, yeah.  Wait, why is the CBS guy here?  I think because they're documenting me.  For what?  For what?  I don't know.  To see how I've grown.  I don't know.  Really?  Yeah, because they said, holy crap.  Look at her on the show.  I'm looking at her now.  What a stark difference.  You know, a huge difference.  You know what a shower can do.  Yeah, but I just walked on Penn Station.  So, like, I just got myself all sweaty.  What's worse, Penn Station or the Outback?  The train getting out here. 
[01:22:30]  My God.  The Outback doesn't smell like urine.  No, it doesn't.  That's exactly what happened.  As soon as I got on the train and it was just, like, permeating.  That's why I decided to walk over.  That's when you know you're home, though, Kimmy.  Yeah.  I know.  Hey, so what are we doing with the NSYNC tickets?  They're in a good location?  Kimmy, we have NSYNC tickets.  Can I have them for my niece?  Oh, please.  If you want to shoot a bottle rocket out of your cooch.  No, no, no.  It's not Fourth of July and I'm not that desperate of a mother.  Well, there are desperate moms that are out there.  You heard that show for the Britney Spears tickets?  Yes, I did.  A mother shot a bottle rocket out of her you-know-what. 
[01:23:00]  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and you had, like, a little plexiglass all around it.  Do we have that audio real fast, the short version?  We'll play that really fast.  Yeah, get that.  It's really good.  Now, because we wouldn't, in our right mind, give away NSYNC tickets on this show in a serious  fashion.  You know, we're not going to do a tent call or something ridiculous like that.  We want, and we know the mothers out there love doing things for their daughters, because  if your daughter's at an age where she likes NSYNC, she probably is starting to get confrontational  with the mom, and the mom's doing anything to get back in the daughter's good graces. 
[01:23:30]  And NSYNC tickets, Mom, that's worth a million bucks right there.  That's like gold.  Thank God.  You'll have your little girl back again.  Remember your little girl that you would take places?  Not the co-core you got now.  Right.  But if you give her these, she will love you forever.  It's buying her love, and there's nothing wrong with that.  And you've got to update the times, though.  Why?  X.  X.  X?  X.  There's still coke whores out there.  Please.  More X hoes.  More X hoes. 
[01:24:00]  Are there X hoes?  I've seen them in the clubs.  God damn.  And X is cheaper than coke.  And they get very friendly on them.  Remind me to put a call into my dealer.  No more coke.  They get very friendly on the X, Anthony.  Yes.  Nice.  Yes.  Paint my schlong like a glow stick.  So is game on?  Game on.  Game on.  Mommy, what would you do for NSYNC tickets?  They're in a good location.  Yeah.  I want to thank Matt for bringing them in.  Matt, great job, man.  Thanks.  So basically, the mommies have to call and tell us what they would do for the NSYNC tickets 
[01:24:30]  for their lovely daughter.  We're not looking for, you know, I'll jog a marathon.  We're not looking for I'll paint something for you guys.  You know what we're looking for.  Well, here's an example.  Uh-huh.  When we played Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Here's the grand prize winner.  This baby is clear.  Psychomark is downrange.  No, sir.  All right.  Psychomark is downrange.  He is hiding behind El Duque.  The big, giant, life-size cardboard cutout of El Duque. 
[01:25:00]  We're firing a bottle rocket at a black eye.  Isn't that a, uh...  Hey, stop it.  Uh, Opie?  Here you go, Ed.  If you would please give me the lighter.  Okay.  Yes.  Clear the range.  Clear the range.  What a great moment in radio this is.  And fire in the hole.  Let's go.  Fire in the hole.  And that's never been more appropriate than it is right now.  Ready?  Don't move. 
[01:25:30]  Here it goes.  Look out, Rick.  And...  We're lit!  We're lit!  We're lit!  Oh, my God.  And...  Achoo!  Uh...  Achoo!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh, my God!  It was beautiful!  It was beautiful!  Wow!  Yeah!  Yeah!  She fired a bottle rocket out of her most intimate of areas.  Fantastic. 
[01:26:00]  Fantastic.  We have a go, Mission Control.  Holy cow!  Wow!  Holy cow!  Steve got that on tape, Anthony.  Steve got that on tape.  Oh, my God.  And there you have it, Anthony.  Yeah.  I was a little excited.  You don't see that every day, though.  I lost it a little bit.  What happened?  Huh?  Why?  You don't see what every day and what happened?  The bottle rocket out of the... 
[01:26:30]  The, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's something you don't see every day.  Sure.  I kind of got a little overexcited by that, so...  Yes, of course you did.  I get abused every time we play that clip.  It's like, oh, relax, man.  You wouldn't have relaxed if you saw what we saw.  It was a fantastic moment for America.  All right.  So, game is on.  We have, uh...  From now until, uh...  Monday, June 4th, to get a winner.  Mommy, what would you do for NSYNC tickets for June 4th at, uh...  Giant Stadium?  And we love when the, uh...  Mother and daughters get involved. 
[01:27:00]  If, of course, they're of appropriate age.  Well, we're...  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  The, uh...  The mom-daughter, uh...  Queef team?  Yeah.  Do we have that audio still?  Do we have that, too?  That was a great, uh...  Moment, also.  So, you missed a lot.  I know.  You didn't hear that one.  No.  You know what happened?  I missed the whole bus thing, because I was away.  I missed...  I missed a lot.  So, I came back, and I was listening to everything.  I'm like, oh, my God, what happened? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  It's not good.  The, uh...  Queef thing is amazing.  It's a mother-daughter, uh...  Making noises from a certain area.  Sure.  It's fascinating.  What are you moaning about?  And I think they did it to a Britney Spears, too, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Jeff, what's going on?  Yeah, man.  I got a question for Kimmy, because she said something on the show that seemed to be so  stupid.  I figured it must have just been, like, bad editing or something.  When she was talking about not eating, and she was like, I don't eat any land-dwelling  mammals.  Can you explain what the difference is between a fish and, like, a chicken? 
[01:28:00]  Why it's wrong to eat a chicken but not a fish?  Do you think?  Land-dwelling mammals, and then you bring up a fish.  Okay, this is the thing.  If you really want to get technical right now...  Yeah, I want to get technical, because that is so stupid, I can't even believe you said  it.  Don't get her in a bad mood.  We're going to get her shirt off.  Yeah, take off your shirt, and then I'll be happy.  As soon as the CBS film crew leaves, we're getting down to business.  Okay, this is the thing, all right?  When I stopped eating meat, it was, like, 15 years ago.  Yeah, you're killing it.  Because they're mammals. 
[01:28:30]  They nurse their young.  They have, like, this family bond.  Fish really aren't big into the family thing.  How do you know?  Well...  They do that school thing.  So you actually...  Get the hook in the mouth, stuck it and wheeled up.  Bye!  I love you!  Bye!  You don't know.  You don't eat meat.  Can I finish my sentence?  Yeah, go ahead.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Let's see.  Give it a shot.  So, the animals that are raised, like cattle and everything, the factory farming and everything,  is just such a hideous, hideous place to, like, grow up, okay?  Whereas the fish, at least, they're not... 
[01:29:00]  Most of them are in the ocean.  Kimmy?  What?  They have fish farms.  They have fish farms.  The chickens weren't raised on a farm.  They're in the outback.  They're enjoying it.  They can run around as much as they want.  Then you chop off their heads and eat them.  What's the chickens are you talking about?  Then you eat them.  The chickens from Survivor.  Listen to me, okay?  It was more chickens for them.  You have...  It was more food for them, bottom line.  You don't have...  Bottom line...  So who cares if anybody...  Bottom line, you don't have a leg to stand on.  You're just another Nimway.  What are you talking about?  I don't...  Okay, okay, this is the thing.  If I was meant to eat chicken or poultry... 
[01:29:30]  You don't eat it because chickens have feathers and you think they're...  Let her talk, yeah.  Can you just hang up on him and I'll just...  All right, I'll be quiet.  I'll be quiet.  You'll be quiet, Jeff.  I'll be quiet.  If I was meant to eat a chicken, I should be able to eat the chicken raw and digest it  without worrying about salmonella, trichinosis, or anything else.  Most of the fish in the ocean, 90% of the fish in the ocean, you can eat raw without fear  of any kind of bacterial infection or, like, brain rot or anything else.  So, if I was meant to eat a chicken, I shouldn't have to, like, kill it and cook it at, like,  this great temperature for an X amount of time. 
[01:30:00]  If I was able to eat it raw, then there would be no problem.  But I don't believe that my body was meant to digest chicken or beef...  All right, now I'm going to call you a nimwit.  I hope you have...  Jeff, what the F did you do?  Her head is spinning around now.  It is.  All I want to say is I hope you have really nice knockers, because that's the only saving  grace, because you are definitely a nimwit.  Well, you know, you...  We like you, Timmy.  You know what?  I look good with my mouth shut, too, okay?  Hey.  Tim, oh, hey now.  All right, Jeff.  Timmy, if I could just ask you... 
[01:30:30]  Chickens a long time ago, you could have eaten them raw.  It's a matter of now, the way they're processed.  Sometimes fecal matter gets mixed in with the meat when they're hacking them up and all  that kind of stuff, and that's what gives you the diseases.  If you just hunt a chicken down or something, you could...  Hunt a chicken down.  You could just cut off a piece of meat and rip open its intestine and stuff.  Some of it you really just shouldn't eat raw.  Same thing with a pig, but a lot of the chicken, the bacteria just start duplicating. 
[01:31:00]  As soon as it's dead.  And what's wrong?  So you're against cooking food?  I'm trying to get...  Wait, you eat fish, though, right?  I've got to get you...  Would you eat the poor, cute dolphin?  No.  That's a mammal, Opie.  No.  I mean, but...  But you all did say land-dwelling mammals.  Yeah, that's a...  It's more food for them.  You know, that's the bottom line.  You know what?  I'll cook it for somebody else.  I just choose...  Well, where do we draw the line? 
[01:31:30]  Like dolphin, tuna, tuna, dolphin.  We've got to make, you know...  Depends how smart you are?  Yeah, I guess.  You know what it is?  They nurse their young, and that's why the whole mammal thing started.  And then, like...  It's cute.  You know, it's just...  It's cute animals.  I just don't do it.  Fish are ugly.  So anything that suckles, you won't eat anything that suckles.  Right.  But it's just more food for everybody else.  Oh, so you're helping out.  I know.  Yeah.  All right.  You've got no problem with that.  What do I care?  You figure it was like seven of us that were there, and we only had six people sharing a chicken. 
[01:32:00]  That worm probably had a family.  Oh, yes, I did.  I felt so bad.  Oh.  You felt bad eating worms?  No way.  No.  My stuff...  No, literally, I felt bad.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  When you were standing there by the wheel of crap, and you got the brains the first time,  and you were like, I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Can we see that big tongue of yours again?  Wow, yeah.  That was all covered with dirt.  That rocks.  We don't want to get into this, because now someone's saying, you know, we have canine 
[01:32:30]  teeth, chickens are not mammals.  Oh, yeah.  No, we're not going to get into the old vegetarian.  No, there's so much more things that we can...  Yeah, we'll talk about some cool stuff.  You hear our interview with Jerry yesterday?  No, I didn't.  I totally missed it, so I've got to know everything that happened.  She loved us.  All right, we'll tell you next, okay?  We have Kimmy from Survivor in the studio.  Andrew Dice Clay coming by.  Oh, again?  Oh, he's going to be in here today.  Yeah, that's what we say.  Oh, that's right.  He was on the phone when you were in here?  Hey, how you doing, Kimmy?  What show are you on? 
[01:33:00]  That survival show?  What's that?  What's that?  Right.  And who did I play?  You don't eat meat?  If you ate meat, how'd you take it?  Medium or well done?  Medium or well done?  Yeah.  We'll try to do a really fast interview with Kimmy next before Dice takes over the mics.  212-757-1027.  Yes, Rick?  Oh, how long is this?  It's just a few minutes.  Okay.  Another example of Mommy, what would you do for...  Was this for NSYNC or Britney Spears?  This was for Britney Spears.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets? 
[01:33:30]  Just so the mothers out there get an idea.  Britney Spears, Oops, I Did It Again, by making ourselves queef.  Whoa!  Wow!  I'm not kidding.  Wait a minute.  The both of you are willing to come into this studio.  Yeah.  We put on Whoops, I Did It Again, by Britney Spears.  You two perform it by queefing.  Yeah.  We can make ourselves queef.  I guess it runs in the family or something.  You taught your daughter how to do that?  No.  She just knew how to do it all.  She just learned how to do it.  Oh, but there's a little problem here with that one. 
[01:34:00]  What's the problem?  That she's daughter's 14 years old.  I mean, it sounds all well and fine, but maybe...  I bet it's a pitch you can't even hear.  Like, dogs turn their hands.  Like, mom's is like a bassoon, and the daughter's is like a piccolo.  Dogs all over Manhattan are turning their hands.  Oh, my God.  All right.  How do you know she can do this? 
[01:34:30]  She's done it for me before.  And what?  Are you all giggling and everything?  Oh, yeah.  It's like a bonding experience.  I guess.  Yeah.  Are you...  How does your family run?  Are they overweight?  Is that why you're queefing?  No.  We're very thin.  Thin, thin girls.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, Anne, she doesn't have to be naked to do this.  I don't know if it's a sexual act.  I'm just playing devil's advocate.  Right, right.  I'm trying to figure out if there's anything here, Anthony.  Is there any way maybe we can hear a precursor on the phone? 
[01:35:00]  You want to hear a queef on the phone?  Let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone.  All right.  Ready, honey?  Let's do a mother-daughter queef over the phone.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  This could be the best thing we've ever done in our lives.  I told you.  I heard one low one and one squeaky one.  God damn.  You're all burning in hell.  You're all burning in hell. 
[01:35:30]  Damn you.  All right.  Let's...  Hey, were you the first one?  Yeah.  Yeah, I could tell.  It was just like I said.  But...  I think it's bigger with each.  And then all your daughters is a little tickle-off.  Yeah.  What is...  What?  Oh, my God.  Let's turn the mics up outside of their house.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Can we hear that again?  You want to hear it again? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Get the phone a little closer to both of your areas.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  We'll be careful.  Yeah.  Quiet, I should say.  All right.  Did you hear it?  Wow.  I got to say. 
[01:36:30]  That is amazing.  All right.  Of course, we haven't...  Thank you.  We haven't described what they're doing.  So, if John dumped out of the show, I will...  No, no, no, no, no.  Everyone knows what Queen's name is.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, this is great.  So, you could do this through your clothes and everything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Okay, they're loud enough.  And this is what Mommy would do for the Britney Spears tickets.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  We both love Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  Do you hear?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we did.  Yes, I...  I...  All right, listen.  Oh, no.  All right, hold on.  Where are you, folks?  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:37:30]  The legend is here, Anthony.  The legend.  The legend.  We'll get him in the studio in a few minutes.  And drove.  Why doesn't he ever come just alone?  He's got like 30 people out there.  He's always got...  Very...  He's a posse.  Very intimidating.  Anthony, which one is this?  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Yeah, just when you thought you heard it all.  Here comes Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Kimmy, do you have any problem with the sex?  No, I do not.  All right, man, you don't have to listen to this commercial.  He thinks he's black, what?  Because he's got his posse.

He's smelling a hair.  No.  I'm out of my face.  I'll stick it up your ass.  Hey, be nice, Dice.  That's CBS.  That's CBS.  It's the company we work for.  That's like a real network, not this UPN stuff.  Real.  Real.  What's a UPN?  You don't know him.  What do you mean, I don't know him?  The guy's doing the camera on me. 
[01:39:00]  Well, what do you want?  He's doing the track in the mountain.  The guy's doing his job.  Yes, sir.  Who is he?  Is he with you?  He's with CBS.  He's with Survivor.  He's with CBS.  He's with Kimmy.  Kimmy's with CBS.  Yeah, we all work for the Tiffany Network, my friend.  Doing what?  Doing it.  Yes.  You ever see Survivor?  Yeah.  They take him to Australia.  They got to hang out.  Yeah, good.  Where's the ass for us?  On the floor.  Right on the floor.  She's the one that doesn't eat meat.  Where do I sit? 
[01:39:30]  I want to sit in there and him.  No, no, no, no, no.  We figured the seating arrangements out.  This is really nice.  Yeah, so you're over there now.  I've got to be near Anthony.  No, that's okay.  I like being next to Kimmy.  I've got to be near...  He likes the boy.  Hey, look.  He doesn't like the girls.  Look at Kimmy.  Look at her.  Who smells better, you or her?  Look at her, Dice.  Hey.  Who smells better, you or her?  I smell good.  All right.  All right.  Let's get past the Pinnacle Hornigot.  Yes.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.

Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh!  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh!  Dice, Dice, baby. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, man, they're here now.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Gotta love the dice.  Oh!  Oh!  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  I'm over here now.  I gotta have that.  I got your legs. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, man, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with bulls.  Oh, nice, nice, baby.  He's a gentle at this point, does he?  Nice, nice, baby.  He's a scumbag.  Nice, nice.  I'm over here.  Nice, nice.  I'm good like that, my friend.  Good boy.  Oh, look what we did to you again. 
[01:42:00]  The rain doubles.  You know, I can't go on to that.  You gotta give me a cup.  Isn't that nice?  You want that, right, guys?  Nice.  Beautiful.  All right.  I need one CD4.  Let me introduce everyone else, even though no one else is going to be able to talk.  I need one for performance and one for pleasure.  We have Jim Norton, who's becoming a star.  Dice.  You better watch.  He's becoming a star over there.  That's the whole point.  The headline material.  Becoming a star on our show thanks to you.  You introduced us to Jim Norton. 
[01:42:30]  That's the whole idea of them opening for me.  And we got Kimmy from Survivor to your left.  Uh-huh.  Nice, huh?  Nice.  Yeah, she's very nice.  You're not feeling it with her, though.  No, I didn't even get starved.  What am I supposed to be all over this board?  You like the lips?  She's got a nice lip.  She's got a light...  The bottom lip, when she closes it, looks like it's got a nice drag on it.  You know, for the underside.  Nice drag.  You know what I'm talking about.  I know.  I know.  When they pull up slow, like...  Oh, we understand the drag. 
[01:43:00]  You know what I mean?  Put a pop at the top.  You know what I mean?  That's how you do it.  I wonder if CBS could use that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not doing this for CBS.  Yeah, you are.  You don't like the CBS?  I don't have a problem with them, but, you know, I didn't bring them in here.  I don't even know this guy.  This guy could be anybody.  They're not even focused on you.  I don't even know him.  What, they don't focus on him?  What are we talking about him for?  They're here for Kimmy.  All right, well, let him talk to Kimmy.  It's fine.  This is our chance at national exposure.  We're going to be part of this, you know?  You seem to get ice with us, Kimmy. 
[01:43:30]  You keep looking over here.  Kimmy's hot.  I'm not saying she's not hot.  She must be half a fag or something.  Look at her.  I see stuff like this all the time.  Oh, God.  This is what I do.  All right, all right.  I'm not you.  This is what I do.  Like that, yeah?  Like this.  They're all over the joint.  I mean, she's hot, you know, but...  Dice, your pants are really...  I've been with her before.  Maybe a different hairstyle, different height.  Dice.  Genitals.  What's up with your pants? 
[01:44:00]  Millennium.  What's up with your pants?  Millennium.  They're big.  32-inch.  They're huge.  Look at those bells.  Look, you got these big...  The pants, but they're not bell bottoms.  They're that size the whole way up.  Well, figure it out.  They're like tree trunks.  Figure what out.  Figure what out.  What grade are you in?  What do you mean?  Figure what out?  The back of them have big pockets on them.  What are you talking about?  The whole leg is a pocket.  Wait, you got pockets on them, too?  Oh, yeah.  I'm right.  Bosco, or you bet?  I say you bet.  You bet?  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  You see what I mean?  Yeah.  I guess.  Yeah.  Now, why, though?  Bosco, or you bet?  Which way?  You bet.  You bet.  What about the...  That's all I say.  That's it?  And...  Na-na.  That's all I say.  Oh, I don't understand.  Maybe I'll dress like you.  No, I'll be in crap brown.  That's green.  This is green.  I've got to take my glasses off.  Pine tree green he's wearing.  All right.  Go for him. 
[01:45:00]  We had a photo shoot today.  He's a tree.  We were looking good today.  I'm not saying it's normal.  But you've got cartoon figures on your pants.  Yeah, exactly.  It's millennium.  What's cool about that?  It's got a vibe.  Yeah?  Juvenile.  See, you walked down...  What?  She's calling you juvenile.  You bet you were back in school, right?  I am.  You know, you're not supposed to grow up and be like this.  Oh, yeah.  We're so grown up.  Look it up.  He's like in a normal shirt.  What's wrong with that?  You could be an accountant.  I don't have to impress anyone. 
[01:45:30]  You've got the chest hair hanging.  Guys, it's not like you've got to go around dressed like a superhero.  No.  Man, whatever.  And you've got some bling bling.  What's the bling bling all about?  Yeah, you've got a little...  You've got some bling bling around your neck.  Some ice bling bling thing.  What do you got on there?  The lion.  The lion?  The big old Leo.  Get your hands off me.  That's harassment.  That's harassment.  It only works when I touch them, right?  Did you catch that CBS?  She was looking at your lion, Nadal. 
[01:46:00]  That's male harassment.  She grabbed your lion.  Yeah, well, then what?  She wanted to pet it.  You know what I mean?  The next thing, it's in the Enquirer, and there's a whole thing, and she's making money.  Things could be worse.  That's how I earned today.  Things could be worse.  You know what I mean?  She brings her lips with her...  You know what I mean?  She survived.  Hey, ask her a survivor question so they can get it on CBS.  Oh, well, we've got to trust him.  Sure.  Why?  Okay.  Go ahead.  You've got some kind of reputation, Dice, or something. 
[01:46:30]  About what?  I don't know.  She seems to think you're not capable of asking a legit question that CBS would air on their  TV show.  Yeah, they're filming right now, Dice.  You're under pressure.  Mm-hmm.  Don't worry.  You look good.  You're handsome.  All right.  Now, ask her a question.  We all know that.  Of course.  Like, about the show.  But aren't you off the show?  They threw you off or something?  Yeah, I got thrown off so I can come over here and play with you guys.  Yeah, so?  Why'd they throw you off?  Because I didn't play well with others.  Why not?  What's your problem with people? 
[01:47:00]  She doesn't like me.  What's your problem with people?  What's my problem with people?  I'm not a doormat.  No, no, no.  You know what I think it is?  Why?  That your whole life, you're walking around, everybody's like looking at you going, oh,  I got to get in there.  And you know that.  Oh, no.  So the minute you're on the island all, you know, rolling around in mud and you got  a little dirty, nobody's paying any attention, so you had an attitude, so they got rid  of you.  No, I'm just from New York.  That's what happens.  That's not what happens.  No.  That's not what happens.  I like it.  I'm wrong.  You don't like it. 
[01:47:30]  I kind of like that.  But that's what's wrong.  You meet a, you know how pretty girls are.  Like, God forbid you don't do what they tell you to do because, you know, because they  got back.  That's the most sense you've ever made in your life.  That's the way it goes.  But she didn't look pretty on the island.  Exactly.  So everybody was treating her, as you said, like a doormat.  She got an attitude about it, like, God forbid, you know, where's my mascara?  You know what I mean?  And the minute she didn't look all hotsy-totsy, good to go, horny like Harriet, you know what 
[01:48:00]  I mean?  She threw an attitude and they said, get rid of her.  Now, she tends bar out on Long Island, so obviously behind the bar the guys are looking  at her all the time.  She's got the cleavage going here.  You know what I mean?  And then she goes to the island doing the meat pants.  She might have a point here.  No, you know what?  I hate to say it because it's coming out of Dice, but I think he's got a point.  Nobody was looking that good.  And B, you know what?  She's wearing the pink lettuce specials.  You know what I mean?  Hey, she smelled on the island, too. 
[01:48:30]  I'm high maintenance.  You're not high maintenance?  I wasn't smelling high maintenance.  You're not high maintenance.  You've got a boyfriend.  I'll do it myself.  No, I'm dating.  What do you mean you're doing?  Is that a nice thing your parents could be listening to?  You'll do it yourself.  No, no.  My parents are way upstate.  What kind of filthy, dirty thing is that to say?  That's millions of people.  What's the matter if a girl wants to take care of us?  No, there's nothing wrong with it, but why is she talking about it?  See what I mean?  Now, any guy that might be interested in you is going, good.  You know what I mean?  That's the thought.  Master B.O.  She's talking about releasing clitoral tension. 
[01:49:00]  That ain't it either.  That ain't happening.  She's releasing a vulvomania.  That's what it was, Diane.  You know I know what I'm talking about.  She's heading the pool.  The night of the conversation, I was the only one that said something that was actually  permitted on family television.  There was a lot of other stuff that was said that night about girls doing their thing  to their boys with implements, okay? 
[01:49:30]  What?  Wait a minute.  What?  All right, we can get into this.  Like back or the front?  Well, if the girl was using it on her...  A lot of things for your parents to hear.  That's nice.  Obviously, she wasn't going in the front.  So she had some kind of a device.  Yeah.  And she was doing the boyfriend.  This was on the show.  And this was discussed.  They edited it out too messy for a family TV.  Yeah, that's what they always say.  If a girl wants to lay there...  I just can't believe that people even believe that. 
[01:50:00]  And pet the poodle.  What's wrong with that?  Dice, have you had a girl do that to you?  What?  You know, the apparatus?  No, no, no.  You don't like that?  No.  I like straight, vicious banging.  A little...  A little tickle with the pinky?  It starts off with an argument mid-afternoon and ends with a vicious banging.  That's how it should be.  That's any good relation.  You're a hopeless romantic.  Yeah, exactly.  I got the high school sweetheart syndrome.  You know what I mean?  You throw the flowers at them. 
[01:50:30]  Now look what I gave you.  Now open up.  You know, I told you when I called in there, you got to keep constant testicles coming  at them.  That's the only way to keep a relationship going.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's it.  It's got to always...  You can't let them breathe.  Fire, fire, fire the whole time, right?  Yeah, constantly.  Wherever they go.  They go to the broom closet.  There you are.  Oh, look what I got.  My testicles are out of my pants. 
[01:51:00]  Come in here a minute.  Come on.  Your family will wait for you to carve the turkey.  You know what I mean?  You got to always be there.  You got to sneak up.  Well, let's ask Kimmy.  You're in there.  You know, she put your head at their feet.  So when they go to hug you in the middle of the night, hey, kids, right in the yapper.  Into what?  Are you into what Dice is saying?  Is this the way to romance a fine woman like yourself?  Well, you talk in between.  You know, hey, I'm the one that's in the closet also saying, hey, you, get on your knees.  Oh, really?  You know where your mind really is, sweetheart.  I know where mine, absolutely. 
[01:51:30]  Don't give me this Ivory Snow girl next door bull crap.  Come on.  She hasn't given that.  I have not given that.  If it feels good, it's good.  There you go.  And you know what?  The woman could be the wrestler and the initiator as well.  Thank God.  She's going to flash us a little off.  So move over.  That's fine by me, because at this age, when I'm on top, if I get tired, I just hop off.  You know what I mean?  What am I trying to prove already?  Do we have to get him to horny goat weed?  Right.  You don't care about making the girl feel good? 
[01:52:00]  Well, they're always feeling, you know, I'm going to have my tenth orgasm.  Like, no, you're not.  You know what I mean?  We're ten.  Where's the first?  You want to see orgasm?  Look around the room.  Look at the carpet.  Look at your hair, your face, your sister's head.  You know what I mean?  That's an orgasm.  There's the proof, you filthy slob.  You know what I mean?  What can I do with you?  Wear the stamp?  But you're going to do it for the tenth time. 
[01:52:30]  If I did it ten times, we need a snorkel in this room.  Dirty animals try to come off like nuns.  But you've got to do, you know, one good turn deserves another.  But you've got to finish the job.  You've got to return the favor.  You never finish with them.  You never finish.  There's no real proof.  They can say whatever they want.  That's why I don't understand, guys.  That's why I don't understand.  When a guy is in bed with a girl afterwards, he's going, 
[01:53:00]  uh, did you?  Don't question it.  If she gave you a couple squeals and a moaner, good.  She had a good time.  Go to sleep.  I want to call my friends now and tell them what I did to you again.  Hey, why is Norton so quiet over there?  Oh, my God.  No, because he's a little wild today.  What's wrong with Norton?  There was a lot of leakage.  Yeah.  I'm in a really foul, vicious, perverted mood today.  That's why he's enjoying what I'm saying. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  You want to share with the room?  What do they call the filthy animals?  I'm just cranky and I'm really horny.  Wow.  So are the rest of us.  Come on, share.  Whoa.  You don't know what he could do to you.  He even said that like a goody two-shoes.  Come on, share.  Come on, what is that?  You've got to talk sexy, baby.  You've got to put a certain tone in your voice.  You know that.  What, like that?  No, not like me.  I'm a guy.  You're sexy.  Come on.  Hi, Dice.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:54:00]  I thought you were talking to me for a second.  I got confused.  I was.  You know what?  What happened to the CBS film crew?  They ran, fled.  They fled the studio.  They gave up on their idea, I guess.  Yeah, we're going to use this.  Another network I'll never be on again.  So you know what I mean?  You've got to hang.  You've got to be loose about it.  You know what I mean?  The looks are okay.  You're okay?  Jeez, you're looking at her like, you know, like...  Look at everybody else in the room and look at me.  I'm a lot better than...  No, no, you're a very pretty girl. 
[01:54:30]  There's nothing wrong with you, uh...  We'll show you the girls in here.  We'll show you the girls in here.  We'll show you the girls in here.  We'll show you the girls in here.  We'll show you the girls in here.  And on the calculator, you're gorgeous.  Statistically?  No, you know what I mean.  Like, uh...  On the monitor, whatever it would be.  What is it?  You don't...  I don't need to know.  What are you going to make me start thinking?  I mean.  All right, because I...  We understand.  Do you know what I'm talking about, Ophie?  I'm not aware.  Like, regimentally, she would be like, good look.  Like in today's standards. 
[01:55:00]  He equals MC hot?  Yeah.  Where...  Exactly.  I mean, the hair's washed.  I smelt it when I came in.  You saw that.  You know what I mean?  Uh, she's got good cheekbones.  Sure.  You know, she's got the dragging lips.  Nice.  She's got pretty eyes that you would go...  You know, this is a girl that maybe, uh...  Mm-hmm.  Some serious could go on.  Like a nice girl.  You know, and then you date her three weeks.  And, uh...  You walk in and she's with three Mexicans in the room.  Uh, you got me mad last week. 
[01:55:30]  You know, that's what happens.  Don't kick me off.  All right.  Would you tend to do that?  You have a bad temper.  I could see it.  You're hiding it.  No.  Yeah, there are things going on.  You got issues, sweetheart.  Are you a hidden bitch?  No, but...  It's not even that.  I'll play dirty pool.  If somebody, if somebody, you know...  Oh, boy.  What do you mean dirty pool?  Like if you got mad at dice...  I'll pull punches.  Like what?  If you got mad at dice, would you bang the opener to get him back? 
[01:56:00]  You know what?  I just might do it and videotape it and everything.  You know what?  She's got good gums, too.  You like that?  Yeah, she's got good teeth.  That's the first thing you look at.  Teeth and gums.  That's a good thing in a girl.  No pyorrhea or anything.  Right.  Pyorrhea.  You don't need that.  Yeah, like her gums aren't degrading.  Degrading?  You know what I mean.  Oh, some form of degrading, not the gums.  Degrading, sure.  Instead of her gums.  You know what I mean?  Degrading.  No, she's hot looking.  Thank you.  You know, for you.  For him.  But not for that.  No, I don't see her with Anthony. 
[01:56:30]  I see her more with Opie.  They're like...  They could be like the all-American couple.  That's a compliment.  Oh, you get that kind of...  This could be like the new Lee Majors and Farrah Ford.  You know what I mean?  Remember, they were like clean cart.  Right.  Like, wow, look at them.  You look more like Lee Majors than I.  No, no, but you got that, like, all-American...  Like, you could have been a ball player.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That kind of thing.  All right.  So, Kimmy, if there was a guy, you're going out with a guy.  Yeah.  And he doesn't have sex with another girl, but he's maybe in a bar, making out or something.  Do you then instantly go bang the first guy you see to get back at him? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, no.  No?  Oh, no.  What do you do?  She bangs the first 15.  Like, I want to know what level you would take your vengeance to.  Would it be equal or greater than what he did?  It would be when he's not suspecting it, that's for sure.  She would go for his best friend?  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't go for the friend because then that just gets way too dirty and ends.  What's the body language?  You see how both the hands went right between the legs like this now?  Yeah, what does that mean?  No, I would go and look for bigger and better. 
[01:57:30]  Bigger and better?  Mm-hmm.  You're talking downstairs?  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you.  She means black.  Oh, God.  It was just one 14-inch worm, and it was in the Outback.  That was the only job.  Yeah, but think of what you've got to be built like for that to fit in all that crap.  Oh, man.  You know what I'm talking about?  Look at Norton just like, oh, you filthy whore.  Look, yeah.  Norton.  But think of that.  Norton, speak up, because you've got some thoughts in the head.  Norton just made a face.  You're looking at their mouth.  I saw you.  Yes, it's nice.  It makes me very happy. 
[01:58:00]  How nice a gun would look at that temple.  Norton would do whatever with that mouth and then punch every tooth out of it.  No, I wouldn't.  She's very nice.  She's very, very wonderful.  Oh, yeah?  Thank you.  She's a pleasant couple.  Listen to what you're saying.  Don't go by the cover.  No.  Right.  You know what?  There's nothing wrong with somebody that enjoys sex.  There's nothing wrong with somebody that enjoys sex.  I'm not saying you.  I can just admit.  You're talking about stuffing 14 inches.  Kids don't come out 14 inches long.  Do you understand?  And you want to stuff 14 inches in there, plus two big bulldog balls? 
[01:58:30]  Come on.  No, it wouldn't fit.  It would not fit.  You're absolutely right.  And the balls, you're just juggling anyway.  I hope so.  You know, you get some slap action with them.  Yeah.  We're going to have to be careful with the way we're describing.  She doesn't know radio technology like me.  You laid out three things and probably got dumped, Dice.  All right, listen.  Why don't we tell you what I'm saying?  You said the number.  And two big yams. 
[01:59:00]  She's got a mouth like a snake, Dice.  Speaking about all that, I've got to wish my parents a happy anniversary.  Today's their anniversary.  Like the way you're talking.  No, I don't mean what I'm saying.  You know, it's their anniversary, and I want to wish them a nice happy anniversary.  Shut up when I'm talking to them.  Chris, what's up?  This is the best radio ever.  Wow, look at that.  This is the best I've heard since day one.  Wow, look at that.  You rock, Kim.  You rock.  All right, Chris. 
[01:59:30]  CCO from Brooklyn.  You know?  Big up.  CCO representing.  We've got to take a quick break, okay?  All right, man.  Whatever you've got to do.  We have Stalker Patty.  Hey, your girlfriend's here, Norton.  Oh, Stalker Patty.  Patty, remember you felt her up?  Oh, that's right.  Dice is here for that day.  She's got a new attitude, this chick.  Yeah, I know.  I've noticed she got her ass taken, a photograph taken for the contest.  Yeah, now she's like, she's bad-mouthing Opie now and stuff.  Is that nice?  It's kind of cool.  Speaking of asses, the best ass winner is here. 
[02:00:00]  She showed us.  You want to see a good ass, Dice?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  What's his name?  What does that mean now?  I don't know.  It's kind of a joke.  I think that would be, wouldn't it?  That would be.  It would be.  See, that's the humor in it.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah, we'll talk to her next.  We've got a break, though.  Stay there.  It's like the Grease Man said.  Well, if I were to turn gay, I'd want to date Clint Eastwood.  Waddledoodle.  Go ahead and put that shit on the air, man. 
[02:00:30]  I don't care.  Opie and Anthony.  Uh, Anthony.  Wow.  We just found out who won Survivor.  No.  No, I read faces.  I just figured it all out.  You didn't read anything.  I just figured it out.  Be nice and read a commercial.  It'll be our little secret.  Brand new sponsor to the O&A show, Anthony.  Victory Limousine.  We love limo company.

And, Kimmy, you've been limo'd around there?  Uh-huh.  It's nice, huh?  That's been funny.  Thank you.  What do you do with those things, Dice?  Well, where?  The limos.  What do you mean?  You probably had some.  You could do anything.  You probably had some experiences over the years.  I'll tell you the truth.  I did.  I bet.  I did.  They got extra high roofs. 
[02:01:30]  You like that?  Footroom.  I call it.  Footroom.  You know when you push your feet all the way up to the ceiling?  It's a lot better when you just stand up.  And you give them, like, the, uh, you call it the horse.  The horse?  Yeah.  That's the horse position.  How's that now?  What's the horse position?  The horse position is when she's on her back.  Okay.  Right?  Now you point the feet up towards the limo ceiling.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Right?  We're with you.  Now you, uh, incite whatever's around.  All right.  All right.  All right.  And then you pick her up so you're sitting like a seesaw. 
[02:02:00]  No, it's not the horse.  It's the seesaw.  Well, what's the horse?  I don't know what the horse is.  The horse is...  No, it's the horse is like somebody else.  No, the horse is when you bang them and cut their head off and put it in Jack Waltz's bed.  That's the horse.  I thought the horse was grabbing on the hair myself.  Uh-oh.  No, no, but this is the seesaw.  You like your hair pulled?  Wrap it around your hand, Joey.  Wrap it around your hand, Joey.  See, I like with the pigtails. 
[02:02:30]  See, she's really giving the girl next door a look now.  You like that, though, getting the hair pulled a little bit?  Yeah, a little smack on the air.  You know what?  There's a time...  Give me your hair.  Get over here.  Give me the hair.  You like a crowbar across the forehead?  You wrap it around your hand like this.  Give it a little tongue.  Nice.  Wow, nice.  Look at that.

Andrew Dice Clay.  Jim Norton.  So I've got to watch my language a little, huh?  Yeah, he dumped out of a lot of that last segment. 
[02:05:30]  He's good at some of the best stuff, too.  This is what I mean.  And Anthony laughs at me when I use radio technology.  You don't use the technology.  No, I do.  And, you know, I went off a little.  And people don't get big bullies and stuff.  And the thing with...  When you're talking about positioning, like we were saying, like the horse and stuff...  This is medical terms that one of them doctors...  Ah, nah, nah.  Listen, when you're talking about...  Ah, nah, nah.  Technology.  I don't know what everybody said. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know.  I sound like my ex-wife's lawyer, please.  No, it's good.  When you use radio technology, you have to...  But when you're talking...  See, you can't talk about things in certain contexts when you say going in.  Now, I'm just saying it like going in the front door of a house.  But in certain places when you say...  They're not that stupid.  No, but it could be like them cowboy doors.  You know where they had the two doors and... 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, you go in.  I love those doors.  You know what I mean?  Aren't those great doors?  Don't you as far still have those?  Those are the best.  Right.  And that's how I see every time, you know, I'm with a woman.  It's like...  Cowboy doors.  Cowboy doors.  Cowboy doors.  It just doesn't have the shutters.  The HIV corral.  Oh, cowboy doors.  God.  You know what I mean?  Cowboy doors.  Cowboy doors.  I love it.  You know, and then...  I'm not going to say nothing because I don't want to get beats on it.  Fuzzy cowboy. 
[02:07:00]  Fuzzy doors.  Yeah, where do you stand on that?  The fuzz?  Oh, we actually played out what's in the pants.  We played that.  Oh, really?  Yes, we did.  The choices were a regular triangle, a mohawk, a Hitler mustache, or the JonBenet.  No, it was like the boomerang.  Oh, yeah.  The koala.  We had like...  Yeah, but we like keeping it easy now.  Yeah.  What do you guys...  The long guy I went with, it was ridiculous.  She used to lay there and just twirl it with her fingers.  Oh.  She actually would put rollers in it before we leave. 
[02:07:30]  We say that looks like a pool rack full of apple hair.  And when I would see it, I'd go like this.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Nice.  Hey, where's the ass girl?  So now you played that game already?  Yes, we played that last week.  Looks like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  Nice.  You know what I mean?  No.  Nice.  Oh, man.  Wait, that's some radio stuff.  I don't know what he even said. 
[02:08:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait, let them get it down.  You better get that.  Wait, what'd you say?  Don't say...  Wait, wait.  Did you use the C word?  Yeah.  You can't say that?  No.  You can't say the C word.  Unless it's comb.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What the hell is he doing?  Yeah.  I thought you...  I couldn't possibly imagine you used that word.  So I'm like...  What?  I'm trying to figure out what he said.  We all looked at each other like, what did he say?  All right, start over, Jim.  Clean it up.  Yeah, clean it up. 
[02:08:30]  Be a comedian.  The last time I saw her...  No, the last time she combed the...  Ohm.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We heard you whisper the word.  Yeah.  No, but if you said comb in the sentence, you could use the other word.  No.  You can't say that.  You can't.  It's tricky.  It's tricky.  I didn't know what it is.  Exactly.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  All right.  Now, what were you trying to say, Jim? 
[02:09:00]  You don't need Dice's help.  No, no.  Just talking about a girl, very hairy.  And the last time I saw her baby maker, it was selling pot in Jamaica.  It was a Rastafarian.  I like it the other way better.  Well, me too.  Well, of course.  Well, he'll do it the other way at Westbury Music Fair this weekend when he owns up, right?  Yeah, of course.  I didn't even do a plug yet.  I helped you out there.  Of course.  That's right, Westbury.  I forgot why I even came to New York.  That was a freebie for you.  I was on the plane.  I'm going, why am I going there? 
[02:09:30]  Are you doing it in the round?  That's the only way they do it.  It spins.  So it spins?  Aren't you going to get dizzy and fall down?  Yeah, but I'm already dizzy, so, you know.  So it'll equal everything out for you.  Before the show, you've got to spin around the other way real fast.  How many shows did I do at Westbury Reading Happy?  Like, 50?  You've done at least 50, sir.  I've done a lot of...  I did a...  Might I add that the legend always sells out because he is a star?  Ah, there you go.  Thank you, happy face.  That's happy face.  Yes, we all know.  All right, he's starting. 
[02:10:00]  Madison Square Garden, the Beacon Theater, Rose Bowl with Guns N' Roses.  Shall I continue?  No, no.  You know, people are starting to say, funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  Exactly.  How about that?  Now, excuse me, Mr. Opie, I can't help it that he's a legend and that he goes up in  front of thousands of people and entertains them.  That's not my fault.  I just say what the truth is.  I just lay the facts out.  You understand me?  Put him away from the mic.  Happy.  Get away from him.  Happy gets all upset. 
[02:10:30]  Well, respect.  Where do you get the name Happy?  He's never happy.  He's happy.  When was Dice disrespected?  Dice wasn't disrespected.  Yeah, now you're yelling.  Happy face.  Come on.  The simple fact that you can't see how he was disrespected is disrespectful.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, come on.  What is he ever having?  What is the problem?  It's not a problem.  Happy.  The guy said, give us a beautiful plug.  There'll be a Westbury Friday and Saturday.  Right.  We are having a fun time.  We're having a good time.  We've got this island chick with us. 
[02:11:00]  It's Kimmy, Dice.  You know, the island girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She could come.  You want to come to the show?  Yeah, you want to come to the show.  Sit in the front row.  I'll tell you what I really think.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  I really get in there nice for you.  All right.  You'll be slipping off that chair.  So check out our best ass winner.  Let's see.  All right.  This is the lovely Allison.  She won the best ass contest.  We put photos of her ass on the ice.  Nice, right?  Show it to Norton now.  Nicely nice. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, that makes me very happy.  Bite it like a Macintosh apple.  I just want to put saran wrap over my face and take it like a man.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  He wants to touch it.  Nah, I wouldn't touch it.  What do you do?  What about a poke?  Besides poking.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask this.  Yeah.  Besides your ass work, whatever you do with that.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Oh, God.  Here we go again.  Lots of things. 
[02:12:00]  I do hair and nails.  I teach.  What do you mean you teach?  You teach what?  I teach manicuring class.  Oh.  Well, I did up until last night.  I'm sorry, guys.  That's my class.  I would say I wouldn't mention that.  And I just saw it.  And I saw it.  And I saw it in a movie over the summer, which I brought scripts in.  Oh, Jesus.  What just happened?  Holy.  I just wanted to go.  You're talking too long.  I'm going to take a nap.  Hey, she just got divorced today.  So let's give her a round of applause for that. 
[02:12:30]  There's something, though.  What?  They moved my name again.  What, for the divorce?  Yeah.  Oh, so you're not divorced yet?  No.  No.  The minute you stop bouncing on a stranger's bag, consider it over.  You know what I mean?  And then everybody danced.  You know what I mean?  That's what happened.  Yeah.  You know, people are always looking for a problem.  Right.  Yeah, no, I was in the, with the. 
[02:13:00]  With the tank.  In the, what do they call that?  The gas station.  The gas station.  Are you brain damaged?  Yeah, the gas station.  How do you forget these things?  What's that thing?  No, well, you know, they put different names.  So I'm with my lady, right?  And the guy looks in the, in the window.  He's like, uh, fill her up.  I got out.  I wrapped the nozzle around this guy's neck.  Well, you don't open your mouth.  You don't know her.  You know?  And then everybody danced. 
[02:13:30]  You know what I mean?  This is why there's so many problems in the world.  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  Nobody knows when to keep that mouth shut.  Right.  Just asking if you want to guess.  You know what I mean?  It's like I was with, uh, I'm at one of these outdoor cafes.  Yeah.  I'm with my lady.  You cafe?  Right.  You know what I'm talking about.  Like an outdoor luncheonette.  Right.  And, uh, you know, my wife goes, uh, uh, what time is it?  So before I even answer, the guy sitting at the next table goes, 3.30. 
[02:14:00]  I'm like, where are you to get involved?  I start smacking him in the face with the table.  You know?  You know, like he's trying to make me look bad.  Like I don't know the time.  And everybody danced.  I just took her out to, you know, give her some wine, uh, have a couple laps.  You know, you gotta have a couple laps, right?  Even if you're manicuring someone, right?  Probably take your foot, do something down there.  Yeah.  You know, get the tip.  Allison, what was the problem with your marriage? 
[02:14:30]  What was the problem that you had to get a divorce?  I can't go there.  All right?  Because I'm not first talking.  Give us a call.  Pending litigation, right?  Pending litigation.  We're good.  Everybody gets nervous, you know, when they're being sued.  Yeah, they call pending litigation.  We're trying to get everything from them.  We're good like that.  What happened?  He got everything.  Yeah, but you got that.  Hey, sir.  Can I help me, honey?  Yes.  Got you married the first time.  It'll get you to Westbury.  Brian, what's going on? 
[02:15:00]  Brian.  Guys, I call and watch in a while, but this is the funniest radio I've ever heard in my  entire life.  There you go.  You can see the ass we're looking at.  It's really lovely.  And his name is Andrew Dice Clay, and we'll be...  Andrew Dice Clay is a staple of comedy.  Right.  He's funny.  He's a funny guy, but he's so bald, but he can't accept it.  Take it easy, Diamond.  Good for you.  At least he's got a job.  What are you doing?  Happy months.  He's in Manhattan for $5,000 an hour, you punch! 
[02:15:30]  You bum!  Shut your mouth!  By the way, sir, he's not going bald.  He had hair, but your mother pulled it out.  Wait a minute.  You can't say that.  You can't say that.  Can they beep that?  I think they got it.  They can beep it for the replay.  Sugar!  Dice was doing who went to what, and then what happened?  My friend, I get very defensive. 
[02:16:00]  No, it's okay.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Wow.  Look at your head.  It's okay.  What's wrong with his head?  It's awful.  My head really looks like a turtle's erection.  My head stinks.  No, you've got a great head.  I don't.  It's all head-like.  I know.  You know what I mean?  Do you like his head?  It's like you look at his head, and you're going, ha, ha, ha.  I have no structure.  No, you don't see that.  Do you like shaped head?  I love the shaped head, because then you can rip your hands over the stubble.  It's the chemo, pal.  Love that.  You know what it is? 
[02:16:30]  There's no real thing.  My head looks like a cancerous donkey testicle.  There's no real...  Oh, God damn.  There's no real structure to it.  You know what?  That's the only thing missing.  Structure.  Yeah.  It goes any which way.  Yeah.  Fat pill.  We just need some mold and stuff.  What's wrong, Norton?  Nothing.  I just had a...  I thought we were all having fun.  I'm having a very good time.  Her ass is really nice, though, man.  You want us to break talk to Patty in so you can calm back down?  That was definitely...  That's definitely the thing in the yang.  Yeah.  Patty, bring her in. 
[02:17:00]  Let's see what Patty looks like.  Of course, we all remember Patty was felt up for the first time by a man, by anybody.  How old is she?  That was Jim Norton.  She's in her 40.  45.  45.  She is a virgin.  The first hands that were ever laid on her bare chest.  Was Norton.  I know.  Look at this, Dice.  What a mess.  I met her.  I met her.  Yeah?  You like, huh?  Nice.  Nice.  Patty, show Dice your ass.  She's not too tough, heavy, but baby got some back.  You like that, huh?  Patty, show Dice.  Show the hiney.  Come on.  Not every day you get to show it to a star. 
[02:17:30]  Are you wearing a thong today, Patty?  No?  All right.  Just show her, man.  Show her.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's be nice.  She's got the sex appeal of stomach cancer.  See, they should get married.  They get along.  Right.  Right.  Look how she gives them like a little whack.  Patty's got little barrettes in her hair today.  Pulling it back.  Very cute.  She's cute.  I like it.  Now, show that ass.  Patty, come on.  Show the Dice, man.  Come on.  There's no cameras in here. 
[02:18:00]  Let's go.  Don't be shy.  There you go.  No one's looking.  There we go.  There's got a log stick out, is there?  You've got a turn in.  Come on.  You're a mountains girl.  Go ahead.  There you go.  All right.  Look at this, Dice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  It's like a whole thing.  It's a virgin bottle.  Nice.  You've got a whole thing going on down there.  Not bad, Patty.  Patty, Dice, no one's ever touched that.  You know, that's a virgin territory.  You're lacking, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  Imagine how she'd scream the first time.  Forty-five-year-old virgin right there. 
[02:18:30]  That's the only ass that would be safe in a prison shower.  He touches way of complimenting me.  Yeah, I know.  Patty, can I ask you something?  Are you wearing a little makeup today?  Yes, I am.  You are wearing a little...  I see a little rouge on your cheeks.  Yeah.  You've got some lipstick on, and you've got a little eye shadow on, don't you?  Yes, my new wife.  Patty, very nice.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:19:00]  Stomach cancer still?  Mm-hmm.  With the makeup?  No, bowel.  Okay.  It's moving out.  Stop making fun of her.  I like her.  She's right.  It's my girl.  Thank you.  Patty's nice.  It's my girl.  All right.  Shoot an oyster right on that ass.  Everybody goes home a winner.  Have a couple laughs with her.  You know what I mean?  That's my girl.  You would turn her down.  Is that what you're saying?  No, I wouldn't. 
[02:19:30]  Patty's very nice.  Yeah, say something nice to her now.  Um, I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  You see what I mean?  That's sort of like a compliment.  There you go.  I like the compliment.  That's endearing.  That's sweet.  Norton, compliment her on one of her features.  Take a good look.  Compliment her on one of her...  Like, Kimmy has the beautiful eyes, the nice mouth, the nice rack, the nice butt, nice belly with the belly ring.  I don't know what's going on between them.  There's a lot going on there.  What about Patty?  Um, I like you because you have the posture of a Down syndrome vagina. 
[02:20:00]  What does that mean now?  She's a little round-shouldered, that's all.  A round-shouldered, you call that?  No one got that.  Of course, there's a weak bust line.  That's a weird thing that I say.  Down syndrome. 
[02:20:30]  See, you're right.  Right?  You're slouching, Patty.  Don't slouch.  See, now you're popping.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, look at that, Patty.  Patty, you've got to start wearing bras, Patty.  No, you don't.  Yes, you do.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  You want them to stand on their own.  No, I like it when breasts look like love handles.  I've never worn a bra because they're so uncomfortable.  They're so uncomfortable.  And who's looking?  You've never worn a bra in all your years? 
[02:21:00]  I try to.  Patty, you're talking to a microphone.  You're talking to a microphone.  With the microphone.  I'm sorry.  No, they're just uncomfortable.  They never fit.  They never fit.  They're small.  You have to go to a bra place, a nice lingerie, so I now measure you up and...  Oh, there's Miss Perfect down Patty, what to do now.  See what's going on, see?  What's that?  She's like, you're stepping on her like...  No, I'm not.  Oh, like you're going to make her look like you. 
[02:21:30]  Come on, you see what I mean, Kimmy?  Where do I get you in that audience?  She's got a lot of...  When I don't have to use technicologies.  You're saying that Patty has potential?  Yes, I do.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  What would you do to her?  Adrian, uh...  Potential?  We will take her out and buy some clothes and get her the lift and the...  Well, what's wrong with the clothes?  And a black jean separates the meat pellets.  Is that good?  That's good.  That works.  Fine.  She's got a nice casual gray shirt on. 
[02:22:00]  The hair's like berettet out.  You know what I mean?  And they're popping.  She's got sexy glasses.  You know what I mean?  Oh, new glasses, too.  All right, man.  Let me tell you that right now.  They should get a...  I go right to your neck like an animal.  They should get a makeover to get her into...  Like a pit bull destroyed.  Yes, absolutely.  That's right.  A makeover.  I really believe that.  You get a guillotine and a house painter. 
[02:22:30]  Let me go to Jim.  The men and the girls are not a perfect 10.  I like Patty.  She knows I like her.  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  Uh, Tim, it's Tim.  You're the one that molested him.  Hold on, hold on, Tim, hold on.  Sure.  I like that.  Uh, Tim, go ahead, go ahead.  Listen, Patty, you want to make the bra fit better?  Yeah.  Put it on backwards.  You know, in a way, he's got a point.  Yeah, there you go.  You know what I mean?  I always felt that was the one mistake, like that breast wearing on the back.  You know what I mean? 
[02:23:00]  Because normally you've got that face buried in the pillow, right?  So now you've got to start reaching around to play with these, uh, unessential things.  Normally, if they were right on the back, you could be squeezing them, get in there.  You know what I mean?  You know what?  They should be on the ass, if you think about it.  You know, so there's no stretching involved.  Blue boobs are one on each cheek.  You know what?  I'll tell you this.  Maybe they throw a pair on the front just to be ambidextrous. 
[02:23:30]  Grab one in the front, you grab one boob on her ass, and everybody's dancing.  You know what I mean?  You know when you try to get a good grip and you start slamming them back?  Yeah, yeah.  If they were boobs on their butt, you'd just grab onto them like, uh, like stick shifts.  They'd say, get over here now.  And then you say like this.  You know what I mean?  That works for everybody.  This way the girl's not going on.  You're pulling on me too hard. 
[02:24:00]  Why, they say that to you?  Yeah.  And why is the face normally buried in the pillow for you?  Because you know what most of them look like without makeup.  Like you.  You don't like face-to-face types.  Uh, no.  What's wrong with the face-to-face?  I mean, now and then you get a good face, but that's how dog invention was invented.  You know, uh, dog style.  Oh, okay.  You confuse me sometimes.  Yeah, because, you know, you see, like, you can see a girl like Kim, like, from behind. 
[02:24:30]  So the hair looks great.  Uh-huh.  You know, uh, you know, everything looks perfect, and then you run to meet her, and only she's got a face, like by Joe's towing service.  So now you're stuck with her.  Now you've got to take her out.  So now you've got her home.  What am I going to do?  You know?  Uh-huh.  So you, that's what, you know, you're stuck the face in the pillow.  Sometimes that's good to do during missionary sex as well.  At the end of sex, it's really hard if she looks like Nicholson at the end of Cuckoo's Nest. 
[02:25:00]  We have to take a break.  Dice playing Westbrook Music Fair.  I just think that works.  How do they get tickets, Dice?  Are tickets to the Elm Store that works?  Pete the Meet.  How do you get tickets?  Let Pete talk.  Pete's the ultimate fan.  He actually got 400 tickets.  Pete, are you a scalper?  No.  Oh, okay.  You get tickets through Ticketmaster or at the box office.  Look how he knows.  If there's anything left tomorrow.  Oh, look at that.  Or Saturday.  Okay.  All right.  It's Pete the Meet.  What's the number?  What is the number?  I don't know.  Pete?  Pete the Meet.  Talk.  You're on radio. 
[02:25:30]  It's Ticketmaster.  I'm making you a star.  Not a star.  Ticketmaster number.  I don't know.  Go to your local Ticketmaster outlets or go to the box office tomorrow night.  Pete just got married.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he just went on a honeymoon with her.  Happy?  She's nice as wife.  Yeah, happy.  All right.  All right.  We got to take a break.  What do you mean?  I'm going to take a break.  He went to Italy.  Commercials.  All right.  We'll talk about Italy next.  No, but he's got to go.  Where are you going?  Got to go back to work.  Where do you work?  What do you do?  You want to tell him what I really do?  I don't know what you do. 
[02:26:00]  I don't do much.  What do you do, then?  I'm unemployed.  How would you like a punch in the face?  I'll open your mouth like that.  This guy followed me up dice.  I'm your biggest fan.  That's how I put you on the radio.  Now he's going to want me to tell you what I really do now.  He's got a problem.  Stuff a potato in his mouth and throw him out of here.  I serve French fries at McDonald's.  Oh, do you really?  It's for Patty, though.  Oh, I didn't mean nothing then.  Hey, you're making fun of Patty's job.  Oh, Patty, you work at McDonald's?  Yeah.  Oh, look.  Now he's making a connection.  Patty, how long have you been at McDonald's? 
[02:26:30]  Can I get a discount?  Talk into a microphone, Patty.  You're talking to this one.  Nice.  Talk together.  Almost two years.  Two years.  And I'm looking to leave for another.  There's a lull now.  I don't like when there's a lull.  All right.  That's why I want to take the break.  Take the break.  Another joint over here.  This guy with the French fries.  Piece of meat.  Yes.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  And anything, do you know what to do?  If I don't know, I'm trying to push a button.  What button should I push?  Push the pretty red button. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, it's retarded.  If that's what you get when you put unprofessionals on.  107.  We are a bunch of retards.  WNW.  From the fine folks that brought us Pinnacle Horny Goatweed, Anthony.  They're at it again.  They got something for the ladies to help them with their...  You don't like that.  I know.  You're being too polite, Anthony.  Dice is in my space.  Dice, you're avoiding his...  I'm trying to talk to you about that.  You're invading...  What?  All right.  Wait, wait. 
[02:27:30]  You're invading his space.  You're too close to Anthony.  I'm freaking out right now.  You just decided you're coming back on the air when I'm discussing...  You're too close.  Why do you got to stand here?  No, because I want to talk to you.  Look how I got a job.  Look how uncomfortable he is.  Hey, jerk off.  I'm working.  How come he could say that and I can't?  Because it's used in the term of using you like if I called you a dick.  Go back over to your mic.  I'm using it as a noun, not a verb.  Why so close to Anthony? 
[02:28:00]  That's all.  Why so close to Anthony?  Because I haven't seen him and we were talking about something.  But then we get on the air and I'm trying to do it.  You're right here in my face.  What do you mean in your face?  Come on.  You want me in your face?  I'll get in your face.  You're in a space.  You don't frighten me.  Take it to street level, my friend.  Yeah, maybe we take it down to street level.  Now we take it back to where it was.  What does that even mean?  Now we take it back to where it was, my friend.  Now I go back to where I am.  Dice, I'll fight you underwater.  No, if I was...  Wait.  When? 
[02:28:30]  Back to where it was when?  I'll take it back to where it was.  At what time, though?  When everybody said, hey, hey, hey.  You know what I mean?  Nobody knows.  Dice.  Yeah, you said, right?  You and me underwater.  You said underwater.  I'll be at a fight with a French guy 60 feet underwater.  Well, how stupid is that?  It was really stupid.  It was stupid.  But I was diving in Turks and Caicos down in the Caribbean.  Oh, and you went on the vacation?  I didn't even talk to you for a vacation.  He's 60 feet underwater.  A French guy comes down on his head.  Where's Caicos?  What's that?  Near Baghdad?  No, it's near Haiti. 
[02:29:00]  A French guy comes down on his head, and then his tank hits his hip, and Opie punches  him underwater, 60 feet underwater.  And like, what he does behind water.  This French is his business.  I punched the guy.  How do you get in a fight underwater?  It was great.  No one gets hurt.  He's throwing slow motion sea hunt punches.  Really?  Was it fun?  It was great.  So it was set up, like you're going to fight.  No one gets set up.  How do you set that up?  I punched the French guy in the face.  He pushed me, and then I tried to tackle him.  That's why we should pull him up next.  That's all.  Yeah, the French. 
[02:29:30]  We all hate him.  All right, listen, Doug.  Didn't they give us the Empire State Building or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Liberty.  Lady Liberty.  Yeah, they gave us the Empire State Building.  I think.  The Empire State Building.  That's why I went up there.  I disagree with him now.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  The Empire State Building.  They gave us that Empire State Building and I explained it to him.  Can we talk about the Brooklyn Bridge?  The Brooklyn Bridge comes from Staten Island, I think.  Monkey and Around.  That's where you cross that.  Dice, listen to this.  You're going to love this product.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around, it's called.  The stuff is called Monkeying Around.  You know what it does? 
[02:30:00]  Nah.  It fans the flame of passion.  Listen to this.  It has these herbs in it.  The legendary Monkey Tai Kuan Yin herb.  Pitched from about 110th Street.  It comes from China.  It comes from the Fukin province of China.  Flat-faced monkey.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  I can't say I.  The letter I.  Friggin Bing Crosby.  Okay.  I think it was Norm Crosby. 
[02:30:30]  No, Bing Crosby.  He was always the one beating on his kids.  Sinatra hated them for that.  What the?  I beat my kids.  Picked the oranges.  You know what I mean?  What did we do with that?  He had all them oranges.  Right.  You know what I mean?  No, that's what he would do.  He'd have his kids like in the back up.  Picking oranges like animals.  I read that.  Yeah.  Friggin Bing Crosby.  I'm dreaming of beating up my kids.  You know, that's all he'd do.  That little babbling Bing. 
[02:31:00]  What does this have to do with the functioning problem?  Same thing with bad back Blumberg.  What are you talking about?  Oh, I got a bad back, Blumberg.  Get it?  You know what I mean?  Bing's never going to be on that network, and he won't allow it.  You know what I mean?  No, that's what happens.  You know what I mean?  That's what happens.  No, that's what happens.  Him and Bob Hope, always in the friggin' Enquirer.  Maybe they'll team up again together.  Bob Hope was supposed to be dead three years ago, and he's still getting covers. 
[02:31:30]  You know, I'm feeling a lot better now.  Maybe I'll go over to Bing's and pick some oranges with them kids.  You know what I mean?  Monkeying around.  Maybe bad back Blumberg will be there.  Triple B.  Rub your back for an hour.  Back, get it, Blumberg.  Allison, show your ass to calm him down.  There you go.  Calm down.  You got a bad back, go.  Look at the curve.  What's wrong with the curve?  You always got a lot of pain in that back.  That's a nice womanly curve. 
[02:32:00]  Get over here now, because you said like this.  When you look at us standing together, you see the difference in career success.  These two and those two.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, Dice has the hot Allison and she's got Stalker Patty.  She's got a nice coloring, too.  She's like a bronze.  Right.  She's got a bronze thing working.  Okay.  Where are you from?  Oh, because you're red.  Hey, listen.  I have a real red hair.  Listen, we got to do the Monkeying.  Aren't you excited about this pinnacle monkeying around?  I'm excited about being at Westbury and entertaining my fans once again. 
[02:32:30]  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Those restaurants are all over.  You can have everything back in an hour.  You bring it in.  Just press it.  And then everything's faded when you pick it up.  We didn't put the stain.  Happy birthday.  Wearing our coats over their shoulders, walking around.  Every country comes in.  They don't even know how to put their jackets on.  You like this stuff, though? 
[02:33:00]  Isn't it like a retard?  You're like a retard, guys.  What are you talking about?  You know, with the foreigners, when they come in and they wear their coats over their shoulders.  Right.  Okay.  They have 15 parking lots.  See, I get one thing.  Pinnacle monkeying around.  It's an herbal thing that women take and make them horny.  Oh, kid.  I would like some.  What?  You get them horny by rubbing the banana against there, whatever you want to call it.  I don't even know what to call it anymore.  The pink lettuce. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, the pink lettuce.  See, that makes sense.  We came up with that.  So for great romance and sex, remember the three Ps, pleasure, passion, and pinnacle.  Pinnacle monkeying around.  Go to GNC, get it there, or call them up 1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Then you have to go to stop playing with chopsticks.  They don't tell you the side effects.  And you forgot the fourth T.  Fourth T.  Punch in the face.  Right.  Pinnacle punch in the face.  Pinnacle monkeying around.  Go to GNC and pick it up, or call them 1-800-899-5323.  When it's time to get funky, reach for the monkey. 
[02:34:00]  All right, we're back already.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  You know, what do you care if I talk about Bing?  What's your business?  I don't mind if you talk about Bing.  You talked about him when he was on the news last night.  He's been dead for six years.  No, it's just a fact.  I got angry because he didn't treat his children nice.  But that was years ago.  Yeah, but I was thinking about it.  I don't know what happened.  I snap out.  Neither do we.  No, I was listening to that going, what is this?  What happened?  I gave you a lot of information.  That's all.  Yeah, but about Bing.  Bing, Bob, Hope. 
[02:34:30]  And the guy with the back.  The back guy.  Bubba Backer or whatever.  Lumberg.  Lumberg.  Who is he?  I don't know.  You son of a bitch.  Who is he?  What are you talking about now?  All right, now you take over.  Go ahead.  No, no.  Somebody's got a bad back.  Bad Back.  Lumberg.  Lumberg.  Whatever his name was.  Who is that?  I don't know.  You just were talking about him with Bing.  I got crazy, Mike.  You don't know what happens to me sometimes.  Who was it?  Bad Back who? 
[02:35:00]  I can't remember the name.  You said it ten times already.  Three.  Look, up in the sky.  I can't.  Bad Back, Lumberg.  The three B's.  No, no.  You don't even know what I'm talking about.  You got me crazy, me, with this mawong crap.  All right, can we talk about Sam Adams now for a little bit?  Yeah.  You know what?  I like Bud.  Oh, Sam Adams.  Oh, no.  Sam Adams is the beer.  And guess who drinks it?  Dice.  Bing.  No.  Bing.  Perfect for child abuse. 
[02:35:30]  Jim Norton drinks the Sam Adams.  Oh, I got a bad back.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't drink because I...  Like it's my fault.  I give it to women, though.  I will buy a Samuel Adams, but I'm not just sucking up to the sponsor.  It really gets girls loaded, and that's why I like it.  Sam's great, and they got so many different kinds of beers.  They want the summer ale, but the lager's my favorite.  Love the stuff.  And you can listen to Jim Cook on the commercials talking about all kinds of things.  Brewed with the grains of paradise.  Like my great-grandfather used to say,  when you get chicks drunk, they'll bang at the drop of a hat. 
[02:36:00]  I don't know if his great-grandfather said that, but he says things like that.  His great-grandfather probably said,  look, don't tell anyone I came in here last night.  Wow.  I'll pour this beer you could suck on my creamy head.  On my Sam Adams.  Oh, that's so funny.  He loves it.  This guy is a pro and a perfectionist when it comes to beer.  He's a stark-raving drunk when he's here, 
[02:36:30]  but he's a professional when it comes to brewing here.  Look at Kimmy.  She likes to see how it is.  All right, so you're getting all your beer.  What about my shirts at Harley?  We're going to talk about it in a minute.  We'll discuss that in a minute.  We'll get them on the phone.  All right, we'll get Harley on in a minute.  I don't see the cash pouring in from Harley right now.  I see the cash pouring in from Sam Adams.  No, but they told me if I say something, they'll give me a shirt or something.  Who?  You can't buy your own.  Harley.  Harley Davidson.  Oh.  You see, I'm wearing the shirt.  So they said if I said something about them, they'll give me a shirt. 
[02:37:00]  And Sam Adams said if we said something about them, they'll pay us money for the reads.  Yeah, but I got cash.  I need the shirt.  Well, not you.  We don't.  Not for you.  I thought you were done.  And we talk about Sam Adams.  They sent us beer.  To the back office.  No, but lots and lots of great beer.  Sam Adams, clear beer.  You got to drink.  I'm not sure about Sam Adams.  Sam Adams is over here now because they said nice and nice.  There you go.  Drink, drink, drink.  Let Kimmy talk about Sam Adams.  Do you like Sam, Kimmy?  You know what it is?  I like the seasonal beer.  Yes.  Isn't that great?  Yes, you do.  The winter rail, the summer. 
[02:37:30]  That's right.  Nice.  And how do they figure that out?  It's made with different grains.  Oh, really?  And the hops.  And every season, around Christmas time, you drink the winter rail, and it's got sort of  almost a peppermint kind of flavor to it.  They get summer.  Very nice.  They get summer stuff, and they make a beer out of it called summer ale.  Now they got, yeah, the summer ale.  Summer stuff, summer ale.  So I drink a bottle, and Kim gets it from the other end, like.  Whatever you want to do, as long as you're drinking Sam Adams.  Sam Adams goes in, and then it comes out. 
[02:38:00]  The best plug for Sam Adams, Samuel Adams kills the taste of a roofie.  What did you learn on the show today?  Really not too much there.  Not anything useful, anyway.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned absolutely nothing.  I actually lost rain cells.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today, this bitch still sucks. 
[02:38:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  One, two, seven.  There you go.  W.N.W., yeah.  Harder.  Harder.  Kimmy from Survivor in the studio.  Andrew Dice Clay getting some elbow to the back.  Yeah.  No, I got a bad neck.  Jim Norton.  He's getting a massage.  He's getting a massage.  Yeah.  Jim's warming up for Dice at Westbury Music Fair this weekend.  And you're going to give him more than like three minutes this time or what?  What are you talking about?  He's got the greatest show. 
[02:39:00]  How many minutes are you giving him?  20.  20?  20 minutes, yeah.  That's what he does with that.  Nice.  Yeah.  Pretty standard, actually.  That's what we normally do.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Then you should give him 35, 40.  Believe me.  20 standard.  He hates that he has to do 20.  Yeah, I just want to be in the back trying to get boxed.  Yeah, do you know what Jim says before he goes on?  Uh-huh.  He doesn't care about pet.  He just goes, please, just let one girl like me.  Oh, that's kind of sad, isn't it?  Yeah, I know. 
[02:39:30]  I know.  No, but that's what he cares about.  We turned you on to a cool chick.  She's the greatest.  Hey, Kimmy's coming down.  Maybe she'll bring some animals.  Did he tell Dice about the girl that we turned you on to?  Oh, Aaron.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Where's she buried, Norton?  Where's she buried?  No, she's not.  No, I thought maybe she'd be in pieces.  In the end zone, a giant stadium.  I thought she'd be in pieces.  It was wrong.  Matter of fact, she hasn't called the show since you guys hooked up.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh, yeah.  Scarred for life.  No, but Kimmy's going to bring some chicks down, right?  Sure.  Long Island girls don't go for me at all. 
[02:40:00]  I never get a phone number.  The one she knows will.  Never east of Manhattan do I get a number.  I strike out miserably.  You know what?  You come out to the clubs that I'm working at that night afterwards,  and I will find you plenty of girls.  No fat ones either.  No fat ones.  No, no.  You got girls.  I'm watching.  I don't want, you know.  Kimmy, you got girlfriends and stuff?  She's got hot girlfriends.  Do you?  I'm trying to.  I'm wondering about that.  Yeah, I have a girlfriend.  You got any girlfriends with the big Long Islanders?  Notice how she doesn't want to push the girlfriends. 
[02:40:30]  You know what it is?  No.  Notice it's all about her.  The attention thing again, Dice.  You know what it is?  The attention thing.  It's unfortunate that most of my girlfriends are, like, approaching the witching hour of  marriage, like, all around 30.  Yeah, that biological clock.  And they're all dropping like flies, getting married, having kids.  I told you they've got a shelf life.  No fun.  A shelf life.  Women have a shelf life.  Just like butter and milk.  Yeah.  Hey, Dice, did you meet?  I studied this.  Did you meet Deb DeDyke over there?  What do you mean?  That's her name.  Deb DeDyke.  Yeah.  How old are you? 
[02:41:00]  We were talking about Holly.  Hey, get next to Jim Norm.  Yeah, we were talking about Holly.  Off the back a minute.  Come on.  Take a break.  Patty, it's like the Tonight Show.  You know how you got on the couch, and then Bob Hope would be there, and then Bing would  come in.  What do you mean, Bob Hope?  And then Bing would have to slide over on the couch and make room for Bob.  Yeah, and he's yelling about Bayback Plumberg.  That's what you've got to do, just to make room for the new people that need the mic.  Right.  Yes, there you go.  They get bumped by Bob Hope, and you're being bumped by Rosie O'Donnell.  All right.  Deb DeDyke.  Dice, talk to Deb DeDyke. 
[02:41:30]  Deb, you work at Holly?  No, I don't work at Holly.  I work at Island Tattoo.  Oh, no, I know.  I want to get the shirts.  We were going to call them.  Hey, Deb.  Don't worry about it.  What do you mean, don't worry about it?  Don't worry about it.  I've got to get the shirt.  Who do you find hot?  I've got to get the shirts.  Who does Deb DeDyke find hot in the studio?  Oh, definitely Allison.  Allison, huh?  Definitely Allison.  Because of her scantily clad outfit?  He, well, you know, I get her to run her fingers through my hair all the time and stuff like that. 
[02:42:00]  Wait, do you guys know each other?  Oh, for about ten years.  Have you guys ever bumped donuts?  I've been trying real hard, but I've noticed that.  Ain't working out, huh?  You haven't given her anything?  A little taste?  Although, she did give me a little camel toe last year.  A little camel toe?  A little camel toe.  She's giving everyone a little camel toe today.  Really?  Yeah, take a look.  I can't see any camel toe.  Look at these words that come up.  Hey, Allison, pull...  Camel toe.  Pull the, yeah.  It's called smuggling a yo-yo.  Yeah, show us some camel. 
[02:42:30]  Show us the hoof there.  And that's a Duncan butterfly.  The what?  Jim, explain it to her.  She's looking confused.  What happened?  What you have to do is, what they're talking about is you pull the bikini briefs a little bit tighter  to showcase the reason men acknowledge you.  Give a...  Give a...  Give a...  No, give a frontal wedgie.  She's got a frontal wedgie.  She's got a daughter in here.  I didn't say to do it.  She's telling her to do the horseshoe.  Well, have the daughter do it, too.  A frontal wedgie.  Yeah.  The daughter... 
[02:43:00]  Your what?  Mother...  Mother...  Oh, you will.  Please wow.  All right.  Please wow.  You're going to let your daughter wow, Allison?  Yes, she will.  Shut your mouth.  Let her wow.  Wow.  It's our decision.  Uh-uh.  That's not a real wow.  That's a real wow.  That's a wow.  That's a wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey.  Very nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Who said...  You, you.  Very nice.  Na, na.  Pretty big.  Allison.  Allison.  Allison.  Allison, what happened to your boobs?  Your daughter got them all, huh? 
[02:43:30]  She shook them all.  Yeah, those are big.  Huh?  What happened?  I got the teeth.  I was just two and a half pounds.  She was only two and a half pounds when she was born.  That's almighty.  Okay, so I...  What happened?  Yeah?  What?  How long were you pregnant for?  Three weeks?  That's amazing.  Six and a half pounds.  Wow.  Oh, that's really spectacular that your daughter's got those.  They are wonderful.  They're wonderful.  You guys make out and stuff, too?  Sure.  You ever do the mother-daughter tag team action? 
[02:44:00]  Huh?  Don't they want to win NSYNC tickets?  You want the NSYNC tickets?  Mommy, what would you do for NSYNC tickets?  Contest is on.  They're both of age.  We could get some good things going.  Well, Kim, what are you suggesting?  I'm suggesting, you know, make the show a little bit more interesting.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, look.  That's a bad show.  Dead to Dyke, yes?  Well, Allison was going to do a mommy-daughter thing here once, but it kind of got panned.  What?  Wait, get back on mic.  Who are you?  I love your hair, right?  Allison, talk to us.  Get on mic. 
[02:44:30]  And what were you going to do?  What were you going to do?  What was the joke you were going to do?  She called in.  Well, we were just, like, goofing off, talking about those, like, what was it, NSYNC tickets?  Britney Spears.  I was Britney Spears.  Yeah.  And we called, she called in.  And?  We were going to make out.  Oh, you were the two.  That never showed up.  That didn't show.  I don't know.  I told you that was in.  Guys, you got something to make out?  No, I think they're hot chicks.  You never get, like, kissed nice, go to bed, you know, nighty-night.  We like the incest stuff. 
[02:45:00]  You got something for the incest?  Just get a strap on and rail that ass.  Please kiss.  Please just for, I got a spot in my pants the size of a baby's head.  How about, how about just a, we got to work this, I'm telling you.  Can you help me out?  Well, what do you want to happen here?  You're going to give a face full of Chili Norton?  It's called working a pimp hand.  Nice.  Work it.  You work the pimp hand.  You work the pimp hand.  Mother.  Mother-daughter thing.  Okay, how about, how about this? 
[02:45:30]  But they got to want to do that kind of thing.  Well, that's our job.  You cop a feel off your daughter.  That's easy, right?  She pulls her top down.  You just kind of juggle it a little.  Yeah.  What about that?  It's not like you have a wash during the bed.  Right.  So what?  Now they're a little bigger.  You could possibly get me through something that sick.  What?  One thing that would get me is something that sick.  What's that?  You would have to stick me in the dugout at Yankee Stadium.  Yeah.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Where's Mike Torrey when we need him?  Ben!  Damn.  Yeah, call Mike Torrey.  Just maybe.  Mike Torrey? 
[02:46:00]  You wouldn't just juggle one of those a little bit?  Joe sucks.  You grab the bottom and you kind of juggle?  Yeah, it's your daughter.  Why do you think they say it's your daughter?  Right.  I touched that naked seat like I had to.  Well, let's see.  It's a long overdue.  You got to respect her for that.  You got to respect her for that.  You know what I mean?  Doesn't mean Kim can't do it.  Well, Kim's not a relative.  Right.  You know, Kim could get together with the daughter.  Everybody laughs.  We kind of...  You know, technically, they're your breasts anyway because they came from you. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  It's not a part of you.  What's the big deal?  Yeah, it's like it is.  Hey, how about this?  If I juggle them, will you call me, Mommy?  No.  No, I'm not gay at all.  You're a fag hag they call?  Yeah.  Who's the fag hag?  The daughter.  She's a fag hag.  I'm in gender.  What do you expect?  She likes the gay guy.  She's terrific, the daughter.  Look at her.  It's great.  It's all attitude.  Leopard skin coat and boots.  Yeah, you like that? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, a lot.  Allison, does the daughter, you know...  Please call her.  Could use a good trash.  Does your daughter, you know...  Nice.  Does she go?  Nice.  The daughter goes, Opie.  I'm just asking.  Digging in there.  Does she talk to you about her kind of question?  Oh, yeah.  Do it.  Oh, really?  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  It blows my throat.  No.  Come on, West Side Story.  No, I'll do it at Westbury.  No.  You won't.  I will do it.  I promise.  Yeah, he likes to hum the theater.  Ready?  Come on. 
[02:47:30]  One time.  One time.  It blows my throat.  It blows my throat.  What if Kimmy helps out with it?  Do you know?  What?  I want to see the mother and daughter kiss.  Who cares about it?  Yeah, I know.  I just touched the cleavage.  Who's this guy with the video now?  Who's he?  It's Father.  That's Steve.  Is he your friend?  I don't know.  He's a great guy.  A friend of hope.  A friend of hope. 
[02:48:00]  A friend of everybody.  Oh, really?  Thanks.  We're all friends in here.  Yeah, I don't care.  They're in here.  They're friends.  I don't trust you.  He used to play Santa Claus in Colorado around the United States.  What are you going to do with it?  Maybe the camera should.  Who?  Who?  Damn.  The mother and daughter.  Allison, come on.  Help us out.  This is like the showstopper.  Yeah, just real quick.  Throw you a half hour.  We're only looking for a half hour.  All right.  Yeah.  Come on.  How about, this is the showstopper, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is it. 
[02:48:30]  We have to end with a big finish.  Yeah, we need the big finish.  And we could all, we could yup to it.  We could boogaloo to it.  Yeah, one yup, double yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, one yup, double yup, yup, yup, triple yup, yup, yup, yup, one yup.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  So they can do what they're going to do.  We're giving them like background.  Will they do it?  And then she holds her buzz.  Come on now.  All we need is a little erotic physical contact of your choosing between mother and daughter. 
[02:49:00]  We can see.  Because we've never had any kind of mother-daughter erotic physical contact.  It's all we're looking for.  This is a part.  Something good.  Does it count that I blocked her?  How about a spanking?  How about daughter gives mommy a spanking?  That's easy.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Let me be the incestuous one thing.  Daughter gives mommy a spanking.  Is this something that goes...  Wait, we'll make a deal.  If you touch her breasts, Kimmy will sit on my face and read the Unabomber's manifesto. 
[02:49:30]  You know, my brother's listening to this.  Oh, nice.  You're probably listening to this.  So will your brother come in, Kimmy, and touch you?  No.  All right.  He's got to have the tort.  All right.  We're going to have to go to the phone.  He's got to have the tort.  You know what I mean?  The what?  Yeah, the tort.  When she's like walking around the house.  You know what I mean?  With them boobs bobbling all over the place.  Yeah.  She's in like...  You know what I mean?  All right.  Well, let's go to Rocky. 
[02:50:00]  Rocky, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a question for Stalker Patty.  Brother's flood in his hand.  Yeah.  She's right there.  Does Stalker Patty realize she's going to die a virgin?  Ouch.  She's just picky.  Picky?  That's not always true.  Yeah, she's very picky.  She just wants to find somebody with a really strong stomach.  Hey, Norton, is that you?  Yes, buddy.  It's me.  Go for it.  See you later, guys.  All right.  We got to keep going with the phones because we're all there hugging a little bit, so maybe 
[02:50:30]  we got to...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're so close to those breasts right now.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Oh, a little touch.  A little touch over the clothes.  Yeah, I saw that.  I think we might get some juggling.  Come on.  Got something going over here.  Some nursing reenactments?  How about a quick ghoulie finger?  I don't even want to know, man.  Stalk juggling.  Play the hurdy-gurdy music.  Now I'm on.  Let's go.  Play some music.  Let's do something.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  A couple quick ones I learned.  Yeah.  I learned that Stalker Patty has the posture of a Down Syndrome badge. 
[02:51:00]  Right.  Norton, what a line.  Thank you, buddy.  And Opie wants to know why it took so long for him to see Adam Floor naked.  Yeah, that was a little weird before.  Great show, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Nothing over there, Dice.  You're useless today.  What do you mean I'm useless?  I gave you a great show.  You're 30 minutes ago.  I'm the greatest thing.  Get this done.  What am I supposed to do?  It goes quick.  Get it done.  I don't do this.  This ain't my thing.  I mean, this is a pimp.  Pimp hand.  What?  You've got to work your pimp hand.  You've got the clothes.  It looks like you can do it.  No, come on now. 
[02:51:30]  Get over there.  Do something.  Take off your shirt already.  Do something.  You look like a superhero, right?  Get the leopard off.  There you go.  Get over here.  Come on.  It's not every day.  How old are you?  18.  All right.  Throw your shirt off.  Come on.  Come on.  There she goes.  Okay.  Dice is working.  Nice.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  You know what I mean?  Look at the black bra.  Lose the bra.  Come on.  All right.  Come on.  You did it.  What do you mean?  Let them hang like the animals they are. 
[02:52:00]  You know what I mean?  They're very lonely animals.  What do you mean they're lonely?  You've got guys.  Come on.  How many bananas have seen them?  You know what I mean?  No, actually 29.  They all like bananas.  You know what I mean?  The minute a guy meets you, what's he thinking?  Hey.  And now I go like this.  Nice.  You do.  The big TF, right?  Nice.  You do.  How many guys want to just TF you?  Well, she's also got that mouth.  You know what I mean?  I thought Jimmy had the mouth. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, but she had a mouth.  I thought it was a mouth.  Who's got the better drag, though?  You know what?  The lower lip drag.  Jimmy's got the drag.  The lower lip drag?  But she's got an over-the-top hang.  You know what I mean?  She's got a great mouth.  Believe me.  All right.  Now her shirt's off.  Dice has done very well.  She'll feed off of it.  And her mom's in the right now.  Now the daughter's in the bra.  You know, it's also the hunger for it.  Yeah.  You know, a woman's got to have a hunger for that.  You know what I mean?  Like they get their oxygen from it or something. 
[02:53:00]  Now, Kimmy, you know, she's playing like nicey-nice.  Right.  You know, I'm over here.  This one's at least saying, you know, you know, I love the banana.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Right.  You know, give me some palate paste.  Whatever she says in bed.  I don't know.  Keep working it over there.  I got to talk to Kimmy.  What do you mean keep working over it?  You're doing well.  Look at your puppet all of a sudden.  Look how well you're doing.  Yeah, she's got her shirt off.  Danielle, what's up?  Hold my neck a little more.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned a couple things today.  Hold my neck.  Yeah.  I learned that E equals MC hot. 
[02:53:30]  And I learned that I have a set of cowboy doors.  Yeah, you got the cowboy doors.  Did I bring something to this show today?  Cowboy doors.  That's ours, though.  We did that.  What do you mean?  We did the cowboy doors.  That wasn't me?  No, that wasn't you either.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was.  No.  What about the other thing?  The Bing Crosby, you know what I mean?  We were talking about Bing yesterday.  So you must have been listening to our show.  You know, that's what happened.  Because I don't even know what I was thinking about him.  That's obvious.  What about the other guy with the bad back?  What happened?  Blumberg?  I don't know. 
[02:54:00]  Bad back Blumberg.  He's our friend.  Comes in here all the time.  Does he really?  Yeah.  How's his back?  It's not good.  Really?  Not good.  You should massage Dice's back a different way.  Yeah, rub it.  Yeah.  Wrap him around my neck.  Let me see how that looks.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Dice is going bald.  Got you left.  Bye.  What is that?  You know, you started the gotcha last game.  I'm going to remove my ear hair and have it implanted in my head.  You started the gotcha last game. 
[02:54:30]  Remember?  That was me.  That was you.  I don't know.  I don't remember that.  I'll give you that one.  Stai.  I never said that ever.  Hey.  What's up, Stai?  What's going on, Nona?  Hey.  Hey, Norton, everyone.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, a couple things.  I learned that on a calculator.  Kimmy's gorgeous.  Right, yeah.  And, uh, Patty's got the only ass that would be safe in a prison shower.  You were paying attention, right?  Thanks, Norton.  You're welcome, buddy.  Bye.  Peace.  Why are they saying what they learned?  Because it's an educational program. 
[02:55:00]  I didn't know.  You turn this, like, into a thing?  This is like Sesame Street.  We give out grades and stuff.  I didn't know that.  Over here.  Harder.  Over here.  I don't think we're going to get the big finish today.  You know what?  This ain't my problem.  It's not my show.  What happened to the big finish?  I don't know.  Why are you looking at me?  That is a tough call.  You're not a success unless you get people to commit incest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't just get your hands under the sides of those things and give a little...  Just give a little squeeze.  There you go.  Come on. 
[02:55:30]  Listen.  Oh, nice.  I've done that before.  I missed the whole thing.  That's a big finish.  There it is.  There it is.  Take him out.  Take him out.  Mom just felt up the order.  Take him out.  You got to take him out.  Mom just felt up the order.  Here we go.  Great.  Nice for you.  Boogaloo.  You got to take him out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Whip him out.  Whip him out.  Whip him out.  Whip him out.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Nice.  You should be lucky you can do that. 
[02:56:00]  Do you realize Olivia Newton-John's mom can only do that with one hand?  Oh, my God.  Wrong.  Oh, here come the noises.  Check, please.  That's a winner.  Here come the noises.  The noises.  What's wrong with the noises?  We like the noises.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  See, that's funny.  That was great.  How about this?  Your balls are showing.  You're part of our noises, Dick.  I know, I know. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, baby, got back.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  How come this girl isn't like this?  How come she's not, she runs out?  She's scared of you.  What?  She's scared of me.  I didn't say nothing.  Because you're a ruthless prick.  How can you say that?  Because what are you saying?  She's a nice girl.  She interns here, and you're saying things about her.  What's wrong with her?  I didn't say anything about her.  What'd you say?  What's wrong with her back?  What'd you say to who?  I said baby got back.  What'd you say?  About her back.  What's wrong with her back?  What about it? 
[02:57:00]  No, no, baby got back, right?  What a big ass.  Nice.  No, it's a compliment.  I don't know.  That's what I like, that kind of packaging.  How old are you?  They made them all talk about it.  21.  So she knows what I'm talking about.  What are you talking about?  She knows what I'm talking about.  Get in here.  I don't know what you're talking about.  21, trying to look like she's 12.  Pulling it off.  No, maids.  See, this is the girl next.  Come here.  Kim, look at her.  What's your name, sweetie pie?  Kelly.  Kelly.  You live alone?  Um, yeah. 
[02:57:30]  Really?  No boyfriend, right?  Yeah, I have a boyfriend.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So does he like the baby's got back?  Yeah.  He does, right?  So it's not like I'm making anything up.  No.  You know what I mean?  Like he constantly has to be around it.  Yeah.  Right?  Like your ass is golden, Dan.  Right?  Right or wrong?  Sure.  It's like, does he ever say, you're my little girl with the golden ass?  Did he ever say that to you?  Like, well, like from behind, like he's biting your neck deep and he's going, oh, oh, baby 
[02:58:00]  got golden ass.  That's the biggest compliment you could ever pay a girl, I think.  Like, biting her neck?  Like you throw a bottle of perfume at her or, you know, one of them fake rings and go, oh,  look at that golden ass.  Now, come here.  You know what I mean?  I mean, this is a guy you serve.  How long are you dating this guy?  Three years.  Three years, right?  So, oh, so you're bored already, right?  You're cheating already?  No.  Yes, y'all.  Look at me.  Come on.  No.  Come on.  Give me a kiss now.  Come on. 
[02:58:30]  I'm back.  Come on.  Kiss the legend.  Oh, wait a minute.  Why, why did Anthony say that?  What?  Why did he get involved?  With what?  What happened?  Is this your girl?  No, it's not my girl.  Oh, is this the girl on the side?  No, that's not the girl on the side.  Then who's the girl on the side?  There's no girl on the side.  So what do you care what I'm doing with her?  I don't.  All of a sudden there's a little jealousy going on.  I said nothing about that, Dice.  You know what?  You're the one that's asking her to kiss you and you're married. 
[02:59:00]  I'm a legend, though.  My wife understands a legend.  Oh, sure.  I hear the phone calls when they're...  What are you talking about?  She walked through the other day.  I told her, get out of here.  She's got a boyfriend in there.  I heard when you call the house.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah, it's Andrew.  What are you doing?  Then I hear in the background.  Dice, get off the phone.  Okay, honey.  I'm sorry, baby doll.  Oh, you got to say that sometimes.  I'm my own man.  I do.  I do.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm my...  Come here.

There's rules I laid out now.  Rules?  Yeah, there's rules in the house.  Yeah.  I'll get off the phone when she says.  Now, what are you talking about?  You're the one, when I'm talking to you at home, like we're just cuddling up watching  a basketball event.  That's what he says when I'm talking to him. 
[03:00:00]  What are you doing to you like basketball?  I'm just sipping a beer with my little sweetie Petey over here.  He hates basketball.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Baseball, whatever he watches when I call.  Why the killing me?  I'm my own man, Anthony.  I'm my own man.  I gotta hang up now, Dicey Dice.  I gotta hang up now, Dicey Dice.  Yeah.  I gotta hang up now.  Dicey Dicey.  Ah, you, you, because you said.  I'll clean the toilet in a second, honey.  Dicey, get off the phone and clean the toilet.  Okay, sweetie pie. 
[03:00:30]  I gotta go.  Now, you're the one when I call up, we're doing a little cuddle with spooning.  That's what he tells me on the phone.  Dicey, mow the lawn, goddammit.  Okay, baby doll.  Any second now.  Can I please talk another minute?  We gotta get out of here, man.  What do you mean, we gotta get out?  Where's baby got back?  Why did Kelly lean?  You did that to sneak her out of here.  I did nothing.  That girl liked me.  She would have made out.  Dicey made out? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, I was gonna make out with her.  Dicey, I was gonna crescendo this.  Dicey, you gotta take your nap.  What nap?  It's nap time.  Really?  Yeah.  Take your superhero clothes and go take a nap.  Not that he needs any beauty sleep.  And Kelly.  I need a phone boot to get changed.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, what about Harley?  You gonna call him?  No.  You said you was.  Next time.  Harley got the plugs.  No, I don't want him to plug.  I want the shirt.  I want him to stay on the road.  All right, what hotel are you staying at?  They'll send some stuff. 
[03:01:30]  We're staying at the Sheridan in New York.  With you.  No, you're not.  You know what?  I'm gonna crack this ashtray over your head in a minute.  Where are they gonna send the stuff?  They're not.  I'm gonna pick it up.  They'll send it right to your hotel.  No, I'm picking it up now.  Where are you staying?  We're at the Sheridan on 50-something.  No, you know.  You're on Long Island somewhere.  No, we're not.  You know the...  Look at him.  Look at him smiling.  You're on Long Island.  So what?  What does that mean?  They're trying to find you so we can hang out.

And you guys are missing...  Why do you care what hotel he's staying at?  All right?  Let's just shut your mouth.  All right?  Don't worry about where he's staying.  Oh, happy face.  It's blatantly obvious he doesn't want to say.  So let's just end this now.  And you're all missing the point that beautiful Kelly has a book.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  So let's get back to business over here. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Rub my neck.  That'll show me that you love me.  Come on.  Gorgeous.  Come on.  And your boyfriend will be happy.  Can you get my tampons at the store?  Okay, baby.

They're doing the best of Ron and Fez.  It was the time that you and I went on their show really, really drunk with the dominatrix  and all that.  Is that the one with Brian Regan was sitting there? 
[03:04:30]  Brian Regan was hammered.  We were hammered.  Yeah, that's a good show.  Ken Stevens came in hammered.  Hammered after he was with his girlfriend.  I remember that.  We're going to be part of like seven hours of radio tomorrow.  So check out Ron and Fez as Ant and I are in rare form for this one.  Yes.  I made a dominatrix leave when she started crying.  Opie insults a dominatrix and she leaves.  Good for Opie.  Good for Opie.  Which was just beyond me.  Yeah.  So it's going to be interesting radio with Ron and Fez.  Then we're going to be on with Ted Demme, director of Blow, Anthony.  Ah.
