<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie complaining about neck pain and his skepticism of chiropractors, quickly transitioning to a discussion of the recent Metro-North train derailment, blaming driver fatigue or texting, and criticizing the MTA's response and the expected lawsuits.  The hosts then critiqued the rising George Washington Bridge tolls and the perceived mismanagement of New York City's transportation funds.  This led to a discussion of Mayor Bill de Blasio's seemingly staged photo op reading to children,  spurring commentary on his image and his wife's past.  Callers Gene and Jose contributed to this discussion, with Jose comparing NYC's pre-K program to later school start times in Scandinavia.

The conversation shifted to Billy Joel's Madison Square Garden residency and a comedic analysis of a video clip showing Paul McCartney's surprise appearance at a Shea Stadium concert.  Next, the hosts criticized the New York Post's sensationalist coverage of a woman taking a selfie with a suicidal man on the Brooklyn Bridge, expanding into a broader discussion on inappropriate selfies and social media's role in documenting such events.  The proposed ban on e-cigarettes in New York City was debated, with the hosts sharing personal anecdotes about smoking.  The show then covered a prankster using social media to target individuals, highlighting the implications of readily available personal information online, before concluding abruptly mid-sentence while discussing addictions, specifically caffeine.

A subsequent segment heavily featured a scathing critique of Criss Angel's "Believe" magic show, with the hosts using offensive language to describe what they considered poorly executed illusions, specifically dissecting the "resurrection" and elephant disappearance tricks, highlighting the obvious flaws in the performances and camera work.  Brandon Steiner, a collectibles expert, was mentioned as an upcoming guest.  The segment included tangents about Justin Bieber's legal troubles, a politician's anti-bench-warmer legislation, a short impromptu song, a host's alleged subway encounter with a zombie-like individual, a LiveLeak video of a man urinating on a subway car, and further tangents involving Hanukkah, Roy Orbison's death, and Miley Cyrus.

The next segment revisited the debunking of a Chris Angel magic trick, this time using Google Images and YouTube to analyze the elephant disappearance illusion, pointing out inconsistencies in the video.  Brandon Steiner then joined the show, discussing his business, including the creation of ice scrapers from broken hockey sticks and his unique business selling game-used baseball field dirt.  He described other items he sells, shared anecdotes about acquiring autographs (including Peyton Manning, Mariano Rivera, Mike Tyson, and the difficulties with Curt Schilling), and discussed the value of various sports memorabilia.  He fielded numerous calls from listeners, some winning prizes, others seeking valuations for their own memorabilia.  The segment ended with continued discussion of his business and a call about restoring faded signatures.

A later segment with Steiner focused on sports memorabilia sold by Steiner Sports, including autographed boxing gloves and stadium dirt maps. He discussed the value of various items, including a caller's Jim Brown signed shirt (deemed worthless) and a glove signed by multiple boxers. A humorous and chaotic discussion ensued regarding a possibly stolen Mariano Rivera signed baseball.  Callers participated in trivia for prizes, often struggling with the questions. The conversation touched upon Joe Paterno's legacy and controversies.  A potential Opie and Anthony memorabilia auction in collaboration with Steiner was discussed, including profit-sharing negotiations.  The segment concluded with a gruesome anecdote about Ted Williams' cryogenically frozen head.

The final segment featured Jim Norton answering listener calls, offering advice on various personal issues.  He addressed addiction (food, exercise, and substance abuse), relationship problems (Kegel exercises, ex-girlfriend's sister, and remaining friends with an ex-boyfriend), financial advice (lending money to a friend), and career advice (stand-up comedy, specifically for a caller who grew up Amish).  Norton used frequent crude and offensive language, plugged his upcoming stand-up shows and IHateStevenSinger.com, and discussed a possibly fabricated story involving a caller and his father, potentially linking it to another comedian, Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg, audio!  Antonio!  Enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah, good morning everyone.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Broadcasting live to...  Who the fuck knows?  Now we're styling.  Huh?  Now we're styling.  Yep!  Good morning.  If anyone knows how to get a neck back into place,  please call the radio show. 
[00:00:30]  I need one little fucking stretch to pop my neck back.  Do you want me to work on it?  Oh my god.  Oh yeah.  All of a sudden I'll just have a shooting pain  because the damn neck is pinching something.  Yeah, you got pinch?  I don't know.  This happens from time to time,  but I haven't had one of these in a while.  That sucks.  My neck...  My head is forward.  It's supposed to be back here somewhere.  So I need it to...  I need it to pop back in.  Wait a minute. 
[00:01:00]  Like your neck bones or...  I don't know.  Oh man.  The fucking vertebrae or whatever the fuck up there.  The discs.  I think, uh...  Yeah, you probably got some nerve in there.  Ah, fuck!  What do you do?  I know it'll just pop back in.  You need someone to grab your neck.  And then it'll be alright.  Yeah.  You need someone to grab your neck and go...  Fuck that.  Do that whole thing.  That's why I don't go to the chiropractor anymore.  Yeah.  That neck snap they do?  Yeah.  How the fuck they know that that's not going to break your fucking neck?  That does not fucking... 
[00:01:30]  I do not trust that.  No way.  This looks good.  Yeah.  It's thunked.  Yeah, they go...  No fucking way.  Yeah, they go, relax.  Oh, okay.  And then they...  Shake a little...  They grab the sides of your head.  Yeah, they shake it a little bit and then just go...  Yeah.  How the fuck do they know that's not going to snap something?  And then you get so tense because you can't relax.  The anticipation.  Your whole body's basically telling you not to relax for that.  Yeah.  So I had to bail on chiropractor.  That's quackery, if you ask me.  A lot of it is, I think. 
[00:02:00]  Uh-huh.  Just to kind of get an adjustment, I think, is alright.  But when they start breaking out, I don't know, like penis bones and whatever the fuck it is.  That's not enough.  If you ask me, it's like somebody going to a knuckle cracker.  Here you go, let me...  Oh, really?  Alright.  Yeah, well, that's good.  I don't know.  I adjusted your knuckles.  Oh, I cracked my knuckles.  When I get a massage and they kind of do something with the spine, you feel it going back into place.  And you do feel much better, yes.  Into place.  But that neck twist, get the fuck out of here.  No thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I'll have none of that.  No.  Jimmy might be right about the Metro North guy.  Yeah.  Although I'm still holding out hope that it was texting.  Yeah.  But he was a bit snoozy, they're saying.  Fell asleep.  A little snooze?  He had to take a little nappy?  A little snoozy, yeah.  Oh, boy.  It's basically saying he was in a daze.  And he's saying he doesn't know what he was thinking or doing.  He got that kind of road hypnosis, they're saying.  That's what his union's saying.  What's a road hypnosis? 
[00:03:00]  That's when, you know, you just, and you see shit going by.  And it happens to people like truckers on the highway sometimes.  Right.  And you just kind of nod off.  No, it happens to all of us.  Yeah, yeah.  We've all had that experience where you go, holy crap, what?  What?  I think I was hurtling down this highway.  Right.  No sleep.  Right.  Is that white line fever?  He's got white line fever.  White line fever.  You know what it's called?  Chuck, if we get that left line.  Crash Train's driver dozed.  He caught himself, but he caught himself too late.  He put the train in emergency, but that was six seconds prior to derailment. 
[00:03:30]  Whoops.  Yeah, they're saying the train was in perfect fucking shape.  Yeah.  So, the MTA is fucked.  The first lawsuit was announced yesterday.  Oh, of course.  And they're saying there's going to be a bunch of them, a whole bunch of lawsuits.  You can't derail a train.  You just can't do that.  No, there's a bunch of people on those things.  You can't be going 82 when you're supposed to be going 30 around a turn. 
[00:04:00]  Is there anywhere on that track where they're supposed to do like 80?  I'm sure.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Straightaways.  Straight?  I think so, yeah.  Good old straightaways.  And then you get that curve coming up.  Man, I would love to know what the process is.  You're allowed to go 82, but you know you've got to slow down to 30 around that curve.  Yeah.  What are the warnings that pop up?  Is there shit on the train?  Supposed to be like signals, I think, right?  Yeah, but why can't they do that automatically? 
[00:04:30]  Slow down the train or really...  They're working on it.  Or fucking buzzers go off like, don't forget, you've got to slow this shit down.  They've got to incorporate all kinds of shit like GPS and signals and sensors on the tracks.  They've got no money.  That's what they're saying.  They've got no money.  You know how much we pay for transportation in and around New York City?  Where's the money going?  They said it was supposed to be in place by 2015.  Right.  But that ain't going to happen.  Well, they're talking about, obviously, cars driving themselves.  Yeah.  Which seems kind of pretty crazy still. 
[00:05:00]  Uh-huh.  But trains that are on actual tracks, it seems like we should have done that years ago.  You'd think.  Especially, like you're saying, with the GPS and everything else.  Yeah, technology's got to be there.  Well, the GPS hits you and you go, okay, obviously you got a couple miles before that curve,  so now we're going to start slowing you down.  I'm not saying for sure, or I know this.  I'm just speculating based on past history with unions and people like that at the toll booths and stuff.  But I bet there's a big fucking to-do about that.  But the unions probably don't want the conductors and engineers taken out of the loop and made it automated, 
[00:05:30]  even though it'll be safer and faster and everything like that.  But can't you just incorporate some of this stuff?  That GPS technology is pretty impressive.  It certainly is.  You'd think so.  But it's like the toll booths with the E-ZPass.  You'd just fucking turn on the booth, have one guy there with a wrench in case something goes awry,  and let everybody just zip right through.  But no, we've got to have people still there taking tolls.  And man, I don't know if you heard from the truck drivers yesterday on Twitter, 
[00:06:00]  but they raised the tolls again.  Oh, yeah.  And now its official trucks are going to be spending over $100 to cross the GWB.  Where the fuck does that money go?  It's ridiculous.  Just to get more tickets once they get here.  Well, exactly.  And then they park to try to unload their shit,  and they get parking tickets the entire time they're in Manhattan.  The entire time.  Not one ticket either.  Every stop they get a parking ticket. 
[00:06:30]  And we pay for all this shit.  Oh, yeah.  And the MTA has no accountability.  Where the fuck does all that money go?  I don't know.  Do they ever really do any assessments on these people?  Oh, they got the city by the balls.  Yeah.  They're not controlled by the city or anybody else.  They can do whatever the fuck they want.  Like the mob.  Well, some say.  Yeah.  Some say.  I'm sure de Blasio will take care of the whole thing.  Oh, will he?  Oh, yeah.  He's great.  He's amazing. 
[00:07:00]  Did you see him in the paper yesterday?  I mean, I guess he's doing, he was reading Where the Wild Things Are or something.  What?  He was reading to kids.  Oh, really?  I swear to you, it looked like he was in like some faraway land.  I didn't see one little white kid in the school.  Apology.  No, it doesn't bother me.  It's just, it's pandering.  It doesn't bother me.  See, everybody gets the wrong impression. 
[00:07:30]  It doesn't bother me.  Yeah, but it's obviously pandering.  To who, though?  To his fucking constituents.  Most white schools don't need stupid de Blasio reading a story to them.  Trust me.  Well.  Where my kid goes to school, they don't need de Blasio.  Ah, all right.  I don't need de Blasio reading a dumb story to my kid.  Fuck that.  Paying a lot of money.  I guess he wants to get this pre-K shit for every kid in New York.  Is there room for that?  Are there schools for that?  Is there money for that? 
[00:08:00]  Well, what, a lot of kids don't go to school until kindergarten?  Yeah.  But that's how we did it.  I know, right?  I remember that.  I remember the weirdo kids went to...  Strange children went to pre-K.  Pre-K, preschool, whatever the hell.  Those were the weirdos that ended up becoming really successful, by the way.  The parents were on to something.  The first year of school that I had was kindergarten.  I'm one of seven kids.  I think we threw my sister into preschool.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Not that she's a weirdo, but she was one of seven. 
[00:08:30]  Because it just wasn't what you did.  No, no.  You just, you know, public school.  Hey, it's kindergarten.  My kid is two years away from kindergarten and already in school.  Yeah.  And I'm thankful because at first I thought it was really stupid.  Yeah.  Like, I can wait until kindergarten.  We'll teach him some shit at home.  Fuck no, man.  You have to get your kid into school early now.  It's crazy.  It really is.  He goes four hours a day.  He's pooped out when he comes home.  It's like a full day.  Kid, Jesus.  But he knows shit now.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  He knows a lot of shit already.  Is he learning stuff over there?  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  He's tracing his name at three and a half.  Damn.  He's knowing his letters and his numbers.  That's good shit.  So what?  De Blasio wants all kids to be in...  Yes.  Holy mackerel.  Where's the picture?  I think it's kind of...  Yeah, it's a video right here, I guess.  He's reading.  And then he had his transition team going to work, I guess.  And then him and his family took a little trip to Gracie Mansion to see if they want to stay there or they want to stay where they live. 
[00:09:30]  Where they live.  No one's been living in there for 12...  How long is it?  No, Bloomberg.  12 years, was it?  He hasn't lived there.  12 years.  Yeah.  Because it's a shitty place compared to what he can afford.  Isn't this brownstone on 60...  When you cross through the park, you can see his brownstone because he's got like a little...  It's just a little police booth outside of it.  It's nothing crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he owns that whole fucking building, obviously.  And probably a few others in the city, I would imagine.  You know how nice his place must be? 
[00:10:00]  It's ridiculous.  I want to go in there.  Have you ever seen Gracie Mansion?  I've seen it from the water.  It's pretty fucking impressive.  Yeah.  It's really cool, yeah.  Yeah, they're looking to see if they want to move in there.  And they're also looking for a new police chief, I guess.  And I guess they were saying that de Blasio's wife is in on the whole police chief thing.  Oh, good.  She's talking...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good.  Why does everyone have to get their wives involved with what they do?  I don't know.  It's the dumbest thing.  Oh, boy.  It's the dumbest thing. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, he turned her away from lesbianism, huh?  How about that?  She was a lesbo back in what they call the day.  Yeah.  De Blasio's wife was a lesbian.  She was officially a lesbo?  She was an official lesbian.  Wow.  She wrote about it for a magazine and everything, about how she's a lesbian.  And then he swoops in there and fucking gives her the old de Blasio.  He must know how to use his fucking stick.  That fucking de Blasio cat.  Wait, he talked a black woman out of lesbianism? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Bill de Blasio knows how to fuck.  I guess so.  He should be our mayor.  Yeah, he's all kind.  All right.  You know what?  I'm all in.  If you can turn a black lesbian around, you should be our mayor.  Because that's pretty damn impressive.  Man.  Wow.  I can't get a black lesbian to be my friend.  Wow.  Wow.  That's all right, man.  Yeah.  No kidding.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he skipped her right up.  Learned something already today.  Had a couple of kids there, and there they go.  Couple Afro kids.  Big Afro son gets them elected. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, he's going to suck for the city.  Oh, is he going to be a detriment?  But it'll be fun to watch.  It will be.  It'll be a joy to watch.  It will be fun.  I can't wait to see who he's going to appoint to some of these posts.  That's the big thing.  Well, but he's trying to get kids learning earlier.  Yeah, I guess so.  You know, it's a noble idea.  But, I mean, again, something that's good for the masses,  sometimes it's just not really attainable in the type of capitalistic society we live in. 
[00:12:00]  Well, you're going to have a lot of kids that are way behind, though.  Well, that's true, too.  There's a lot of people starting their schooling a lot earlier.  And then you throw your kid in at five years old, they're way the hell behind.  That's what I've learned.  And they never round up.  And they never touch up, really.  They never round up the school to the people that are excelling.  They always wind it back down to the people that aren't.  And everybody's got to be at that level.  Right.  You know, because you don't want to exclude anybody.  You don't want to make them feel stupid, God forbid. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  So you've got to change the curriculum and everything to suit the dummies  instead of really showing that there's talented young people out there  that should be put to the head of the class, as they say.  But he was reading to kids.  That's a good photo op.  He was reading to kids.  I haven't seen that photo op.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, they don't really do that.  Oh, yeah.  Gene in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Good morning, Gene.  Are you a dancing machine?  Nice.  I am a dancing wrestling machine. 
[00:13:00]  Are you mean?  Oh, you're mean, Gene.  Yes, I've been getting that all my life.  Of course you are.  The time I heard that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I just wanted to comment on Bill de Blasio and his photo op  with all the little beautiful black children.  I mean, obviously that was a position for him to be that way, you know,  just to show that he's a people.  He's a man of the people of the different franchise  and the malcontents of society.  And he's going to be the savior.  He's going to be the guy.  Because obviously he wasn't in a private school reading books. 
[00:13:30]  The kids, he picked an inner city school with as much black kids  and Latino kids as possible, and they sit him in the middle,  and he's supposed to be this, you know, savior that's going to save us all,  you know, in New York and get our kids smart again.  Yeah, that seems to be the thing.  I mean, he's not the first guy to do this, that's for sure.  You could see Hillary and George W. Bush and everybody.  They always pick the inner city's goals and sit down. 
[00:14:00]  I'm not a de Blasio guy whatsoever, but I don't mind that he's reading to kids.  No, no, I don't care about him reading to kids.  I just hope he has his shit together, because what he's trying to accomplish  with New York City could really, really fuck up the entire city if it's not done right.  He's pandering is what it is, though.  It's that obvious, and not just him, it's all the politicians.  Well, that's how he got into office.  They do that.  He pandered to the minorities.  Absolutely.  Afro kid, that's all we need to know.  Afro kid.  He got elected because of Afro kid.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Period.  Yeah.  All right, Gene, thank you.  All right, thank you.  Rock on, Gene, rock on.  De Blasio, head start is bullshit.  The kids don't start school until they are six or seven.  What?  What's that?  Jose, Long Island, what's up?  Hey, man, how are you guys?  Hello.  We're fucking tired.  What do you think?  Let's go.  Yeah, me too.  I'm trying to adjust to work here.  But listen, I've been reading over a lot of this head start stuff, and it's really not, 
[00:15:00]  it's really bullshit, because in Scandinavia, like within the country that kind of, the socialist  country that everybody really, like, looks up to, that they're so perfect, that you got  all the free healthcare and all that stuff, they don't start school until they're six or seven  years old.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, but they probably, like, do some of that homeschooling, I would imagine, some  of those places.  Probably.  They probably have more time to spend with their kids.  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  I bet, you know how Aaron always talks about stats?  I would love to look into that.  I bet you there's a reason why they start at six or seven. 
[00:15:30]  They probably get a lot of education at home.  From what I read, they're saying that you get, your mind is, like, better molded, ready  for school when you get into it when you're six or seven years old, and you're ready to  learn all this.  I mean, obviously, you're right.  They learn how to read and stuff like that from their parents beforehand.  Yeah, I just kind of remember that before kindergarten.  I do have some recollection of that, and it was mostly, like, talking to your mom and  dad and saying dumb shit, and they'd read to you, and you'd learn stuff just by walking 
[00:16:00]  around the house and fucking poking around and looking at shit and asking a lot of questions.  Yeah, that, like, was pre-K.  And then kindergarten, you'd go in there, and that was your culture shock of other kids  and fucking, you know, a teacher and another authority figure.  It comes down to parenting again, though.  Yeah, exactly.  You probably had cool parents.  There's a lot of people out there.  Both parents have to go to work, and you're sitting there with some, you know, fucking  babysitter that doesn't even speak English, because they're the cheap ones, to guess. 
[00:16:30]  Maybe, yeah.  And what are they teaching you?  Yeah.  A couple Spanish words?  A few Spanish words, I would think.  Right.  Learn some Spanish.  All right, Jose.  Thank you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Yeah, you got it.  Is that Billy Joel?  Yeah, Billy Joel's going to, like, live in Madison Square Garden or something.  He's doing a residency.  What does that mean?  John Rickles.  One show a month until the public doesn't want it anymore.  Like, it's a residency is when you just do it in one...  Yeah, it's mostly casino hotels.  Yeah, you do it. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, once a month.  That's easy.  Okay.  Yeah, because he had tickets go on sale from Madison Square Garden, and they just keep adding  shows.  They're like, holy shit.  Yeah.  They didn't expect it was going to be this crazy.  So then they sat him down and made a little deal with him.  So once a month, you get to see Billy Joel at MSG.  At the Garden, yeah.  And you know he'll mix it up, you know?  Probably one month, he'll just do an entire album or something.  A lot of these rock artists are being...  They're very successful with that.  You go see them, and they do one album.  And then their encore is all their greatest hits. 
[00:17:30]  It's perfect.  Yeah.  Did you ever see the footage of McCartney coming at Shea Stadium at the end of his...  It's great.  When he did those Shea Stadium shows to close Shea, he had special guests, and McCartney  had said no at first because he mixed up a date, and then he realized he could actually  come.  So he flew in.  They actually delayed the show just so McCartney could fly in and come in at the end.  And I heard that they met him at Customs, and like the chief of police and whatever,  they rushed him, and he literally just made it before. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  Curfew, right?  You ever saw that?  Yeah, he came to the stage.  Oh, wow.  It's on the Blu-ray for the last play at Shea.  That's a hell of a moment.  You don't think they'd do that for the singer of Men Without Hats?  They'd whisk him to Shea Stadium.  They wouldn't let him in the thing unless his past was perfect.  Is this it right here?  Yeah.  So what?  Did Billy Joel know at this point?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I think the rumor was around, but people didn't know he was coming. 
[00:18:30]  I actually haven't seen this footage here.  Wow.  That's a lot of people.  Man, I just hung out and had wine with Billy Joel last year.  Oh, there he is.  In Huntington.  It's so fucking weird.  There's Paul.  Jesus.  Hey, New York.  It's so cool to be back here on the last night. 
[00:19:00]  Came here a long time ago, and we had a blast that night.  Why is there pubic hair on the screen?  I'm very busy.  We're having another one tonight.  Asian subtitles.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  I couldn't pick a better song.  Come on, man.  Come on, man. 
[00:19:30]  Play something we know.  I'm going to find myself in time.  There's a trouble.  Mother Mary comes to me.  We're playing this out, by the way.  You think up till now and stuff, Paul McCartney's had a good career?  A few flops.  Billy's trying to figure out when he comes in. 
[00:20:00]  Just shut your mouth.  Let's watch a Beatle.  But he's like a fucking ten-year-old kid.  See, he keeps putting the mic up.  He's like, no, I can't do this.  I've seen footage from the audience of this. 
[00:20:30]  I've never actually seen this.  You think people are singing along?  It was odd.  I think a couple of more.  Oh, it's all right.  That McCartney, uh, fucking amazing. 
[00:21:00]  That cocksucker, she really built out a tune, Kenny.  Nice guy in person.  How many people are on that stage?  Jesus.  How about if Billy Joel is going to be jumped up on the piano and the legs broke and he fell?  How many people are in there?  It's like McCartney's shin. 
[00:21:30]  What do they get, 100,000 in there almost?  I don't know.  With the floor?  With the feel.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, a feel check.  That is, uh, what year is this?  How about you?  Oh, in the closing.  Okay.  Stupid shit stadium.  Everybody gets all nostalgic.  Play stunk.  Nostalgic.  The winter night is cloudy.  There is still a light that shines on me. 
[00:22:00]  Shine until tomorrow.  Let it be.  This guy was shut up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, we're going to the sound of music.  But the Mary comes to me.  Speaking words.  He literally doesn't know what to do.  No.  He's sitting there watching a Beatles sing and he's like, what's shining there?  It's fascinating, actually.  He's being alpha male, big time.  Yeah.  Let it be.  It looks like five different people now, sort of. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  It looks like Scorch.  Don Rickles, Scorch.  Wish the world will let it be.  Zin, zin, zin.  Wow.  Billy just didn't know what to do there.  That was really fascinating.  It was something McCartney did.  He was just singing.  But Billy didn't want to step on him. 
[00:23:00]  He's always got to do.  Right.  But then Bill's like, well, look at my show.  He's close to the time of that jam.  How many did he do?  He did one more.  I don't know.  Jesus.  It looks like Mike from Breaking Bad, too.  Billy Joel.  Yeah.  Oh, you can make the audience chant.  Sounds like a Nuremberg rally. 
[00:23:30]  Nice.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That's really cool, actually.  I thought he did, too.  I mean, he might have done another one.  He flew in just to do Let It Be.  Yeah.  He might have done one more.  Probably did one more.  Yeah.  Because I've seen footage of him saying it was like, she was just 17, or I saw her standing  there.  Yeah, I saw her standing there.  You think the cops got him through traffic?  Oh, yeah.  I think the cops got him through the fucking U.S. Customs.  I think the chief of police got him through U.S. Customs.  Yeah.  Whoever it was was really high up in the police department, and he was whisked. 
[00:24:00]  That's nice when you're whisked.  Yeah.  I've never been whisked into a building.  Oh.  I've only been whisked out.  When?  The whisk.  Philly used to whisk us.  They used to whisk us.  Philly would whisk us around.  Philly whisked us around.  An old whisking Philly.  A whisking.  Yeah.  A good old whisking.  A good whisking.  It was embarrassing, actually.  Yes, it was.  They'd pick us up at five in the morning.  There's no one on the streets, and they would have full sirens.  A motorcade all the way to YSP.  We don't know how to accept nice things. 
[00:24:30]  Whenever someone is nice to this show, our whole attitude is like, oh, bull, bull, bull.  I know.  Oh, bull, bull, bull, bull.  We don't deserve this.  Oh, yeah.  He comes back.  We don't deserve this.  What song is it, New York?  I saw her standing there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Now, Philly's like, I can play on this one, at least.  Right.  Yeah.  Play a little honky-tonk piano.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Sir Paul McCartney. 
[00:25:00]  Again?  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom.  Oh.  Well, she was just 17.  Hey.  You know what I mean.  And I wish you looked way beyond your bed.  He just sounds just like you did.  I watched 42 days sing, like, Brazil recently.  Like, I got all these McCartney loops. 
[00:25:30]  And he's singing this fucking 50-year-old rock song.  Yeah.  And fucking, like, 20-year-old chicks are, like, jumping in.  He gets a thousand to it.  It's amazing.  Yeah, because it's a pop song.  Yeah.  I'm glad he's one of those guys that, like, still sounds like Paul McCartney.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's not sad to watch.  No, he's in great shape.  Yeah.  When we saw him play, how long did he fucking play?  It was amazing.  I love his drummer.  Yeah.  He's got that drummer who's really fucking kind of a weird dude.  But he's really good. 
[00:26:00]  And he seems to really enjoy playing with Paul McCartney.  I bet he does.  Yeah.  We got a guy that was at the show saying that Let It Be wasn't even the highlight.  Oh.  Come on.  Rob, what's going on?  How's it going, fellas?  Hey, man.  Well, for a lot of people, Let It Be was definitely, you know, the highlight before for many people.  Hello?  Wow, we're so listening to you.  Let's go.  Miss Saigon.  Billy Joel had a chorus of veterans on stage. 
[00:26:30]  Miss Saigon.  It's goodbye, Saigon.  Miss Saigon was the Broadway play, silly.  Correct.  Miss Saigon.  Anyway, he had veterans on stage in a chorus singing.  And there were people crying.  Like, I looked over and I saw at least a dozen people.  I was probably about 30 rows back from the stage.  And I looked around and I saw about 30, 40 people crying during that song.  Wow.  With the veterans on stage.  So you might want to just check that out.  That was incredible.  I might have to download this show.  Yeah, this looks good.  Paul McCartney just leaned on Billy Joel's back when he was playing. 
[00:27:00]  Did you see if Billy just fucking hit him?  Yeah, and then had him explode on stage.  Stop touching me.  He's a germaphobe.  He had his back Pireld in front of everybody.  Security just takes Paul McCartney off the stage.  He's got to be weird for Billy Joel.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And before too long, I fell in love with her. 
[00:27:30]  I'll never dance with her mother.  Woo!  I saw her stand.  Sounds a little better than when the Beatles were there.  Since I saw her stand.  Since I saw her stand.  All you've heard was...  Terrible.  I was watching Beatles footage from some really weird black and white show they did.  And it's so funny how the cameras were back then.  There was just no movement. 
[00:28:00]  No.  Cut!  Cut!  Cut!  Shots and shots and shots.  It was just one shots on everybody.  Yeah.  And then the band.  It was like from the middle of the fucking...  It was probably from like 50 feet from the stage.  And, you know, the angle was awful.  It was...  They just had no mobility.  Hadn't had that figured out yet.  How did we get on Billy Joel?  This is Madison Square Garden.  Oh, the MSG thing.  The deal he just signed.  So once a month you get to see him at Madison Square Garden.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's great.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  The Post is killing a woman on their front page today.  Wow.  I tweeted a photo for the people that are somewhere else.  Huh?  They're killing her?  Man.  Pretty much, man.  Pretty fucking harsh.  We had a guy that was saved from jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday.  Oh, an asshole that was fucking up traffic.  Crazy.  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck if these guys jump.  I just don't give a fuck.  Even if it was someone in my own family, jump.  They just jump.  You've had enough of it, yeah?  With the me, me, me shit. 
[00:29:00]  Just jump then.  But anyway, this woman did what I would say most of us would have done in this day and age of social media.  Everyone's looking for that picture for their Facebook page and their Instagram and whatnot.  So she took a selfie with the guy in the background.  Yeah.  So the front page of the Post today, selfie-ish.  My photo with Brooklyn Bridge suicide, dude.  Now, meanwhile, even if she didn't do that, the Post would have published the picture of the guy trying to jump. 
[00:29:30]  Of course.  So what makes them any better?  And then you read the story and they're trying to do a whole, it's all about me.  Yeah, the jumper.  Not the selfie broad.  She's doing what everyone would do.  There's a moment happening and she just wants to get a picture of herself in that moment.  Right.  What the fuck was she supposed to do?  She can't help anyway.  Who took that picture?  The Post photographer.  Oh, so he's just as guilty.  Of course.  Dude, these fucking vultures, they're still putting pictures of Lanza in the paper because there's a new book on Newtown coming out. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  They're still doing two-page spreads on them.  Right.  These fucking cocksuckers to criticize anybody else.  You know what?  I didn't even catch that.  Yeah.  The selfie is not even the selfie pic.  No.  It's a picture of her doing a selfie.  Right.  So you're right.  The photographer for the Post had a snap that.  She wouldn't give her the same thing.  Huh?  She wouldn't give her name.  She should have gave her name.  Should have gave her a Facebook page.  Fuck it.  Deal with the hate.  You'll get some likes.  Yeah.  That's what you're going for, right? 
[00:30:30]  Don't jump until I get this picture lined up.  You think she said that?  Of course not.  But that's how the article starts by Paul Martinka, I guess.  America's selfie obsession reached a new low on Tuesday when a woman snapped a cell phone  self-portrait that also captured a suicide man on the Brooklyn Bridge.  With scores of onlookers watching the dramatic 10 a.m. rescue by cops, the crass camera woman  turned her back to the scene, angled her phone toward the bridge, and snapped a shot.  So what?  Exactly.  How dare she do something when the Post is trying to capitalize and make money off it? 
[00:31:00]  Right.  Fuck them.  The scarf-clad blonde even cracked a thin smile.  When approached by the Post afterwards, she suddenly became camera shy.  I'd rather not, she said when asked for her name.  She then hustled out of Brooklyn Bridge Park.  Yeah, Jimmy's right.  They were going to show that picture on the front page no matter what.  Anyway, yeah.  So they make a story out of it.  The shot of the unidentified man who was saved by officers has instantly earned a place in  the Rogues Gallery, not far behind Anthony Weiner's infamous crotch shot and Amanda Bynes' 
[00:31:30]  topless breakdown photos.  Selfies have become so widely popular that the term was named Word of the Year for 2013 by  the Oxford Dictionary.  The craze includes not just celebrities at their worst.  Average people have also become viral phenomenons.  One of the most notorious came in the Bronx in May when Basid McClain, 23, murdered his  mom, Tanya Beard, then posed with a picture of her severed head. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  That's a great selfie.  Wow.  In October in Florida, high school junior Malik Weiter snapped a selfie in a classroom  while his teacher was seen going through labor in the background.  Yeah, that's what people do now.  Wow.  So this is the message the post says.  We are going to give people infamy for doing this shit.  Right.  And then if you want to make yourself a part of something, we're going to criticize you  for it.  They're just such creeps.  Is that the pic that they blacked out?  They blacked out the head that he's holding up in his selfie. 
[00:32:30]  Maybe his mental illness is the issue there.  Where's the selfie?  Where's the picture?  Why'd they block out the fucking head?  Yeah.  Someone's got the picture with the head still, right?  Where's the actual picture?  There's got to be.  If they got the edited one, they got to have the real one.  Mm-hmm.  No?  That's funny.  He fucking...  Boy, did he hate her.  Yeah.  He's smiling, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is smiling.  That's some creepy shit.  He loved cutting off his mom's head.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I wonder what she did.  Mm.  Yeah.  I mean, not only did he cut it off, but then he actually had to line the phone up and hold  it like...  Right.  Yeah.  You know, he probably had a couple bad shots until he got it right.  Mom's head was swinging, so it was a little blurry.  A little blurry.  Yeah.  Not completely in the shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not framed.  I have no problem with this broad doing that.  I don't know what you're going to do.  So...  Because the Post was going to show this sad individual anyway.  Yeah.  About to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge, but it turns out he did not. 
[00:33:30]  And then another thing going on...  Most of these guys don't jump, by the way.  Now the cops talk him down.  Well, I mean, yeah.  I mean, I'm all for the NYPD, trust me.  But I think in the end a lot of these guys...  Yeah.  ...don't have the fucking balls to do it.  And they're kind of thankful that the cops finally show up and make it look like,  Oh, thank God, we're here.  I don't have to go through with this.  Right.  But I guess the city council, again, getting their nose in shit, wants to ban the e-cigarettes 
[00:34:00]  now.  Why?  In every place where there are cigarettes.  Now they want to ban the e-cigarettes.  The whole thing was the secondhand smoke thing and like...  I hate to say it.  I don't have a problem with it.  With them banning those?  Yeah, because I think it just leads to people doing the real smoking.  Really?  I don't see that.  They just don't want people fucking smoking anymore.  Period.  But they can't think for other citizens like that.  Like, I get, like you said, the secondhand smoke thing, but this is just... 
[00:34:30]  There's a workaround and they found it.  Yeah.  To be able to just sit there and smoke.  Like, Ronnie...  Is there any health issues?  Ronnie B was puffing away on one here in the studio.  No, is there health issues when you puff on those things?  There's got to be some kind of fucking chemical shit entering your lungs, right?  There's two camps on this one and no one's really showing any facts.  Right.  Whether it's dangerous or not.  It's vapor.  It doesn't smell bad.  It's not smoke.  You can't smell it at all.  I'm going to change my opinion.  Oh, shit.  Right here.  Right now.  Right here.  Right here.  Right now.  Right here. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Yeah, they shouldn't be able to do that.  No.  I mean...  I didn't really think that went through.  Yeah, I don't like them fucking telling us what to do.  Yeah, because they're just speaking for you.  Especially when it's legal shit.  Yeah.  So I have to change my thought on that immediately.  They just want to blanket cover like, hey, wherever cigarettes are illegal, we're making  these illegal too.  It's like, why?  Yeah.  You need a reason.  You're absolutely right.  And half of the people who do that drink and then get there, fuck them.  Yeah.  Me and Kenny on the way in, we saw three guys, probably mid-20s, heading toward the Christmas 
[00:35:30]  tree area.  So I don't know what the fuck's going on there.  I don't think they were there for the tree lighting, which is tonight.  Tree lighting tonight.  It must be something the Today Show's doing.  And all three of them, it was like 5.20 in the morning, they're just smoking.  And I turned to Kenny, I'm like, that just seems so fucking weird now to me.  Smoking?  Watching people just smoke in this day and age.  You ever see a guy coming in?  Huh?  He probably just left the bar.  But then I told Kenny I was guilty of it.  I was one of those fucking bar douche smokers. 
[00:36:00]  Thought I was cool.  Don't you feel sick when you see somebody doing it?  Like, there's a guy I told you, we've talked about him before, when you walk in, you see  he stands outside and he smokes and he's chewing gum.  Right.  And he holds the cigarette like between his middle and pointer finger low, like towards  the hand.  Oh.  And he's just taking deep drags and chomping on gum.  And I'm just like, cancer mouth, cancer mouth, cancer mouth.  Like, all I'm thinking of is how sick his mouth must be.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, you gotta stop.  I wanna hug him.  And you two smoked pretty heavily for a while there.  17 years.  Yeah.  You did 17 years.  17 years.  Hey, I was a smoker when I first met him. 
[00:36:30]  Loved smoking.  When did you stop smoking?  I don't even remember anymore.  I don't know.  Early 2000s.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  I loved smoking.  It just seems fucking weird when you see it now.  Really strange.  I smelled it last night.  It smells good.  Indoors, it was, Attel was smoking because we, we was, he was shooting something.  It was in the village.  The place was closed over to the public.  And I'm in the building and I smell smoke.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  Yeah.  I thought we were on fire.  The fuck is just Dave standing over there like a fucking lunatic.  I'm like, all right.  I remember, uh, jumping on the school bus as a very young lad. 
[00:37:00]  And then, you know, the smokers, kids would wait until they were about a mile away from  the school.  They thought it was safe and they would light up in the back of the bus, but they would  have all the windows open and all that shit.  But you would still smell that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to love smelling that on the way home.  Smoke would walk.  But I didn't smoke.  Before you take a drag, you'd have to look in that giant mirror that was over the bus driver's  head.  Right.  See if you could catch a fucking drag before she opened up.  They all knew and didn't give a fuck.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't give a fuck back then.  They'd let you do it. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because of course they knew you were doing it.  Everyone else smelled it.  We had a bus driver, a black bus driver.  I'll never forget this guy.  Like, they would rotate whoever would pick us up.  And some school administrator had yelled at all the students smoking on the bus and came  in and said, no smoking.  And then we drove away.  He said something like, you heard the lady, no smoking.  You can smoke all you want.  He's great.  Kevin in, we don't hear from New Mexico often enough.  Kevin, what's up?  Or old Mexico. 
[00:38:00]  Or old.  Yeah, what's new about it?  I was smoking cigarettes.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, go ahead.  I was smoking cigarettes about a year and a half ago and I started on these electronic jobs.  Man, I can't even stand the smell of regular cigarettes.  They make me just friggin' want to puke.  But these things, you know, you get a different flavor.  I'm smoking grape flavored right now.  Well, look at you.  You know, people, maybe they should like the gum and stuff.  Hey, how come you can chew the gum?  I mean, the fucking gum is probably bad for your mouth. 
[00:38:30]  Like, Voss has been chewing it for five years.  It's like, dumbbell, you got to stop that too.  You chew a little bit and it's to wean you off.  Right.  But that's no one's business but Voss's or anybody else's.  In 2013, you would assume they'd have come up with electronic cigarettes at this point.  You know, that's kind of a futuristic thing you would have seen back in the day in movies.  Like, oh, look at what's he smoking.  Oh, it's an electric cigarette.  That's crazy.  And the tobacco companies are still kicking ass, right?  Yeah.  Even though smoking is pretty much banned at this point.  Yeah, overseas. 
[00:39:00]  You get one circle outside your building where you're allowed to smoke.  Yeah.  You know, Dr. Steve put up a thing.  Fuck, Dr. Steve.  He recommends smoking.  I know, I know.  He's the one out of ten that recommends it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good for you.  Rub it on your gum.  Right.  That nine out of ten doctor shit.  Who's the tenth guy?  What?  Yeah, he put up some article or something on Twitter, you know, about the pros and cons or whatever. 
[00:39:30]  And I can't exactly remember what it said.  But, you know, like you said, there are two different camps.  Some say, yeah, it's okay.  And some say, no, it's not.  Well, you know, all I know is this thing has just a small amount of nicotine in it compared to cigarettes.  And it's almost, you know, really, really nominal as far as nicotine goes.  But it doesn't have the 400 or some stupid other chemicals that fucking cigarettes have.  But you're right, dude, but it's also, and as much as I hate to say, it's not, I think, again, I don't like paying for people's health insurance when they're fucking doing things on, we all do unhealthy shit. 
[00:40:00]  But when you're smoking in 2013, you really fucking, you're really just kind of jacking up medical costs for the rest of us.  So maybe I'm, I don't know, I kind of like, I don't want to think for the people.  I don't want to pay for it either.  Well, you know, and here's the second thing to that.  Now, nicotine, according to different studies, and I've done my reading on it, nicotine isn't the one that causes the, you know, the health issues. 
[00:40:30]  Nicotine's no more addictive than coffee is.  So, you know, it takes, you know, I don't know what the hell to say, com si, com sa, you know, whatever.  It's catch-22.  What?  What are you talking about?  Did you just have a mini-stroke?  What do you mean?  Are you just blurting out fucking cliches?  Cliché, man.  Yeah, sorry, Chinese bullshit.  Six to one, half dozen to the other. 
[00:41:00]  Ying-yang.  That's what I was looking for.  Yada-yada.  All right, Kevin.  Jesus.  All right, see you later.  Thank you.  Your time is done.  I have no idea what he was saying.  We've had you up to here.  Oh, man.  Did that call go awry?  Sure did.  So the selfie thing is a phenomenon, and there you have it.  I think that's a great selfie.  Yeah, it's a good one.  Made the news.  Oh, they'll kill her, though.  Now she's got a selfie on the fucking front page.  This prankster.  What do you do?  Fox is doing a story on the prankster. 
[00:41:30]  He uses social media to read people's minds.  So basically what he does, he's using his Twitter, does a little Twitter search, sees  someone tweeting some shit, let's say outside of Starbucks or something, and then he's  in the area.  He goes there, finds the person that just tweeted that shit, and depending on what the person  tweeted, he...  Oh, here he is.  He's explaining.  He puts their information out there on their social media profiles, thinking it's just  for friends and family and stuff.  But really, strangers have access to this information, and that's kind of what blew me away, is that 
[00:42:00]  people put this out there thinking it's safe, but it's available to me.  You mean stuff like...  Thankfully, you're a nice guy.  Yeah, thankfully, exactly.  Personal stuff like this, Jack?  Watch.  Business that you're in, some kind of a business that has to do with self-sell company or phone  company or something like that.  Yes?  Wait, wait, wait.  Someone in your family is referred to as Pops.  Is it like a dad or a grandpa or something?  You are tripping me out right now.  Really?  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  Hi, Jack.  Happy birthday to you, too, because I know you were actually... 
[00:42:30]  I should have said it to you, because yours was before hers, but...  How do you know what their birthdays?  Anyway, like a little white, curly dog, sort of, like a little white dog.  Stop it.  That's creepy.  Give a dog.  Hear it.  Recently, like, had lunch, dinner, or something like that.  Chicken.  There was chicken involved, I know for sure.  Shut the up.  Jack, what has the response been that you put this out there?  I mean, you get a lot of YouTube bits.  That's a great shirt.  Anyway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Usually, you know, I'm just looking for reasons to come up with a new prank video. 
[00:43:00]  Sure.  And so this was a really interesting response, because I get to come on, you know, cool news  shows like this.  Just like that.  Cool news shows.  Who are interested, because it's sort of a privacy issue, I think.  It's a disconnect between what we put up in the privacy on our terminal at home,  and what you find on the boardwalk at various places in California.  Absolutely.  100%.  But a good message within the funny.  Jack Field, where can everyone find you?  Oh, shut up.  Good message within the funny.  Good message.  Oh, yeah.  Go eat bugs.  Yeah.  What's the bug girl? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, boy.  She'll always be known as the one that ate bugs.  She's pretty, man.  Fuck.  She's a twat.  Is she?  Yes.  Everyone knows this.  What's her name?  I forget.  She was on Barbara Walters, The View.  What's her name again?  Oh, is that Elizabeth Hasselbeck?  Oh, Hasselbeck.  Thank you.  Oh, I didn't recognize her.  She's a twat.  Yeah, she's irritating.  Indeed.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Anyway, that was pretty smart on his part.  Yeah, it's a good gag.  Someone tweets in the area.  I guess he focuses where? 
[00:44:00]  By the village or whatever.  You search by wherever you are.  You just look up your tweets.  Yeah, right.  People post their locations.  And they're tweeting all the time.  It's like, oh, fuck.  This person just tweeted from that restaurant right over there.  There, nice.  And then he goes over there and fucks with them.  I'd probably mess it up.  Because then he quickly looks at their...  You quickly look at photos.  Their Twitter to see what they've been up to in the last few days.  And then you could fucking nail them with something.  I'd mess up and refer to them as their Twitter name.  Just give it away.  Oh, that would ruin everything.  Somebody here, Janet1520.  Yeah, it's my Twitter name. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, forget it.  The other side of that, obviously, there's got to be some fucking major crimes going down  because they use it for e-veal.  Yes.  You know, all these people that are, you know, Instagramming the picture of them with their  family going to Disney.  Yeah.  Now everyone knows that your house is empty.  Oh, right.  No.  Right.  It's very scary.  That shit has to be going down.  That for scams, you know, for people that want to scam people.  Well, anytime you're getting information on people, you get a little leverage to work 
[00:45:00]  shenanigans, as they say.  Will they ban nicotine completely?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I doubt it, considering we're getting close to legalizing marijuana.  The weed?  The weed.  But they found a medicinal purpose.  They found the work around there with you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, hey, it helps me out.  Dude, I've been trying to get off coffee for a while.  I mean, wow, what do you want to talk about addictions? 
[00:45:30]  And they always said that caffeine was a motherfucker.  Yeah.  I've drastically dropped it, but I get the headaches and everything.  So then I have to, like, I've been barely drinking it this morning.  I had to drink a full cup just to get rid of the headache.  Oh, man.  I'm 75% down, though.  I'm down to one small, lousy cup of coffee a day, finally.  You got the monkey on your back.  Well, you were a coffee monkey.  When we met, I was doing three pots of coffee a night.  Nice.  And it continued for 20 years. 
[00:46:00]  Now what?  One small fucking cup of coffee, and now I'm down to half decaf, half regular.  But yesterday I was dealing with a fucking headache, so I got just a regular today, and boom, no headache.  What happened?  Do I like a nice shot of a stress out?  She's got some.  What?  I was thinking, as you're talking as regular Joe, I just kept thinking, eh, if I was an octopus, I'd be holding eight cups. 
[00:46:30]  But you don't really think of caffeine as a drug.  They always say it, obviously.  But then when you do try to get off it, you realize, oh, fuck, man.  It truly is.  I never really got on the coffee.  People have worse addictions, obviously.  Yeah, you're lucky.  I like that, you know, espresso with dinner kind of a thing, but that's about it.  I don't do it during the day anymore.  Like, I'll start.  This is my second.  Sometimes I'll have just two mediums in the morning.  Right.  But I used to go all day with coffee, and now I... 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, then that fucks up your sleep.  You get dehydrated.  It's all sorts of shit that happens.  Oh, no.  Everything fucks up my sleep.  Like, last night, I landed with an apnea mask on, just staring at the ceiling.  Yada-da-da-da-da-da.  Oh, no.  I couldn't be more awake.  And you don't put anything on, right?  Like a TV or anything?  No.  That's crazy, because you got the apnea mask.  Nice and loud in your ear.  You need something to distract from that, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't know how anyone sleeps with a TV.  I can't do it.  Dude, I sleep way better since getting rid of most of the caffeine.  And I feel a lot sharper, and I'm not as stuttery. 
[00:47:30]  Not as stammery.  I think my fucking tongue was way faster than my brain.  Caffeinated?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You were all caffeinated?  But still trying to, like, you know, drop it completely, and I had to have a cup just  to get rid of the headache.  It's unbelievable.  Look it up online, what it does to you when you try to...  Some people die when they give up caffeine.  That's crazy.  If you don't do it right.  That's probably because they get into an argument with the wrong guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they're cranky. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  They fucking sound off at the wrong dude.  Yeah.  I was watching something yesterday coming from the gym, and I'm leaving, and there's a fucking  Chinese guy in a van stopped in front of a hydrant.  And he's being blocked in by another van, and then there's a woman parked in front of  him.  She's in the passenger seat.  So the Chinese guy gets out, and is just yelling at the woman in the passenger seat,  but she's not in the car that's blocking him in.  She's, like, in a legit parking spot.  And people...  I think the guy was just mad that he was blocked in.  Right.  And I'm walking, and I'm thinking, like, I hope this girl's boyfriend or whatever comes 
[00:48:30]  out and just breaks this guy's jaw.  Wow.  I couldn't even hear what he was saying.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, like, he was talking to her...  He was trying to get her to move so he could get out of his spot.  I don't even know if he could have because it was the van...  She wasn't double parked.  She was against the curb.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess that prevented him from sneaking out around the double parked guy.  He was hoping to use her to get the fuck out because he's blocked in by the van.  But I'm just, like, some people just start arguments with the wrong people in life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm amazed people aren't getting killed every day by that type of shit because you see it 
[00:49:00]  every day in Manhattan, these, you know, arguments.  Yeah.  Believe me.  I see it.  They're starting to say, engineer, nod it off.  They're really going with that one.  So I might be wrong with the texting thing.  Yeah, they probably checked his phone, and you can figure that out pretty easy.  Pretty quickly, you think?  Yeah, they just check the towers or whatever.  They see it.  But if you haven't said the text in 40 minutes, they know what you did.  Right.  So.  Good luck to you.  Good luck with that defense.  But you're right.  That's not a crime as opposed to, I mean, there's negligence, but, I mean, it's not as 
[00:49:30]  bad as texting.  Yeah, and you could say, oh, it was, you know, I didn't know I had this, and I wasn't  Well, it saves his ass, but.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the union, of course, will stand by him.  Of course they will.  Because that's what they do.  Regardless of whether you're right and wrong, you've paid in, so they're going to stand  by you.  Yeah.  Even if you're wrong.  Well, they're going to get fucked with lawsuits, so.  A lot of lawsuits.  Yeah, union rep tells, that's, that, oh, okay, I feel, that he feels very much.  All right, I'm sure.  What?  Nah, this is, there's nothing there. 
[00:50:00]  He said the union rep.  This accident may be a window into, Mr. Golds.  Well, I think that's what the FRA is pointing to.  All right, that's a foreign shit.  What the hell is the FRA?  FRA, I'm going to guess, some Federal Railroad Association.  That's about right.  FRA.  Yeah, it's the FRA.  It's France.  The whole country of France.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, the wonderfulness of, um, Criss Angel last night.  What?  Can we save it for after the break? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, we certainly can.  You're still watching Criss Angel?  I don't know why.  I can't not watch that dumb ass show when it's on and just get angry at it.  That's Shaq Ballone, man.  Oh, yeah, Shaq Ballone was fucking great.  Took on a life of its own.  It's...  The one video of us just breaking down Shaq Ballone is doing extremely well.  People love it.  It's a nice little visual element for the radio show.  I have a theory about Criss Angel.  All right, save it.  I will save it, but I got a theory about this Spike series that's on. 
[00:51:00]  Really?  Yeah.  And you're still watching?  I don't know why.  I watch and I get mad.  He brings someone back from the dead last night.  Was that the one?  That was a rerun.  No, he did the album one, but I saw it last night, too.  Okay.  They do like a marathon before the new episode.  We're going to do some Criss Angel shit after the break.  And very good news.  We got Brandon Steiner coming in.  Oh.  The collectible guy.  He's very entertaining.  I like him a lot.  And he's going to get...  He brought in a shitload of stuff he's going to give away just in time for the... 
[00:51:30]  Literally a shitload?  I was going to say just in time for the holiday, but guess what?  Hanukkah, not so much Christmas, though, yes.  Is Hanukkah over?  No.  How many more candles?  No, it started.  Oh, it started.  Thanksgiving, yeah.  Oh, I didn't realize.  It's got to be just about over.  Yeah, I think it's been...  Five days.  Five.  Five or six days.  How many do they do?  Seven?  There's eight crazy nights.  Well, that's true.  Eight crazy nights.  He's got a one-day present.  And we stress about one dumb night.  But they don't have to get him good shit. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, you don't celebrate all eight.  It's like stupid stuff.  Oh, wow, a dreidel.  Oh, boy, look at that.  It's the little coins.  Oh, wow.  The little fucking chocolate coins.  I didn't know fucking things.  I thought it was during Christmas time.  They went early this year.  Yeah, this year it went very early.  Oh, it changes.  One of the earliest ever.  It won't coincide with Thanksgiving again.  75,000 years.  8,000, yes.  I don't know.  8,000 years?  78,000.  Oh, 78,000.  Who the fuck's going to be around for that from here? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, most of us won't be.  You'll know someone's lying, by the way, if they say,  I remember the last time this happened.  No, you don't, Pop Pop.  No.  It was 78,000 years ago.  Pop Pop.  Probably won't even be using the same calendar anymore.  No.  This will be in South East.  78,000 years?  Absolutely.  Okay.  In the year 25, 21.  Wow, 78.  That's right now, that's almost, say, 30 times.  It's 30 times the time since now in Christ. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Away from now.  It's like recorded history.  That's a long time.  But it's a drop in the bucket in the universal terms.  Oh, of course.  Shut up.  Okay.  And Justin Bieber's in trouble there, Sam?  Well, the mayor of...  He hopes so.  ...some Australian town.  Okay, we'll get into that.  Video memo.  Justin Bieber.  We love Justin Bieber stories.  Because he's just a...  Raw man.  He's just an asshole.  It's me and you making fondue.  Having fondue.  Even though I like the chorus of that song. 
[00:53:30]  Ugh.  Boyfriend.  Ugh, I bet you do.  I do.  It's a good song.  It's not a deal with me liking cocks.  It's not about cocks.  I like the song.  You don't like his pseudo raps?  No, I don't.  Asshole.  He's going through an awkward time.  I wish he would just go through it like...  Miley Cyrus is taking the exact same time in her life and becoming a sensation.  Yes.  She might be man of the year.  Yeah.  She should be.  Fired out of a cannon.  She's awesome.  I think she's in the lead, right?  For time's man of the year?  That's person of the year, Opie.  Whatever. 
[00:54:00]  That's man of the year.  Oh, and we've got to talk about some asshole politician that wants to legislate bench warmers.  What?  That's something we love talking about on this show.  Oh, boy.  The PC bullshit continues.  Love it.  Find that story for me.  I don't think we have it today.  Or I'll find it.  Whatever.  Yo, be there, three, two.  Anything you want, you got it. 
[00:54:30]  Anything you need, you got it.  Anything at all, you got it.  Baby.  Baby.  Baby.  Every time I hold you, I begin to understand.  Everything about you tells me I'm your man.  I live my life, I live my life, could be with you. 
[00:55:00]  No one can do the same thing you do.  Anything you want, you got it.  Anything you need, you got it.  Anything at all, you got it, baby. 
[00:55:30]  For a minute there, I thought we were just listening to the radio.  Yeah, right?  Just kind of hanging out with some Roy Orbison.  Sometimes you forget that, you got to throw your participation in there.  Roy Orbison.  Never got into Roy Orbison.  Yeah.  But when I listen to this stuff, I like it.  Yeah.  I guess he gave his final concert 25 years ago.  Gee.  And then died two days later, excuse me.  With the Wilburys?  I don't know. 
[00:56:00]  Was it a Wilburys concert?  Traveling Wilburys, yeah.  Concert?  That's when George Harrison, I think, called, what's his name, Tom Petty.  They were in the band together and said, ain't you glad it isn't you?  Oh.  Who died.  Like he was just saying, like it's sad, but he's our friend, but it's better him than us.  Hey, better him than us.  Yeah, right.  Oh, me head hurts.  Let me get back to you.  Someone's been following me with a half full fishbowl shaking it.  Oh, that's just me ears.  Oh, my God.  Good impression, Jim.  Now, this is written, though.  It says, Roy Orbison gave his final concert 25 years ago. 
[00:56:30]  He died two days later.  Damn.  Like he chose to give his final concert, and then two days later happened to drop dead.  No.  He was going to keep on going.  Had more concerts.  Right.  He wanted to keep on going.  But God had another.  Yes.  Did he?  Yeah.  Was he blind, or did he just wear those?  No, that's the whole plan.  God had a different plan for him.  Was he blind, or did he just wear those big dumb glasses?  No, I think he had some shit going on.  Did he? 
[00:57:00]  Man, I thought I was looking at a zombie on the subway yesterday.  He just reminded me of something.  Yeah.  An old lady with a cataract thing happening with the cloudy eye.  Really?  I couldn't stop looking, and she knew I was looking.  And I kept looking down, and then I said to myself, you've got to look again.  I would look up, and she would be staring at me because she knew I was looking.  But it was one of those really over-the-top cloudy ones.  Yeah, like zombies.  That's cataract, right?  Yeah.  Cataracts.  Cataracts.  Yeah.  And then she got off the subway. 
[00:57:30]  I'm like, man, was that a fucking zombie?  Was that like just...  Was she poking around like she couldn't see, or...  Yeah, she was out on a bit of a time.  Did you grind on her ass with your heart on her?  Always amazes me, the blind people in Manhattan getting around.  It blows my mind how they do that.  Dude, they should all get fucking prizes.  It's amazing.  Yeah, that's scary.  Up the block from us, they put in those weird, like, it's these fucking Bloomberg turn things.  Right.  And when you go to cross the street, in the street, there's like that raised bump. 
[00:58:00]  Is that for blind people?  I would assume so.  Ooh.  Good idea.  Like little bumps, almost like something you put your dishes on.  Braille.  Braille, like a braille.  Yeah.  One of the strange things about living in New York, you'll be at a light waiting for it  to change, and all of a sudden you'll hear someone just go, excuse me, is anyone around?  Oh, no.  Anyone around, and you turn to your right or your left, and there's a blind person needing  a little help.  Run away.  Every once in a while that happens, and it's so strange to me.  And you've got to put your arm out so they can't grab on your arm. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you know, have a little conversation and do the right thing.  I say, yeah, don't worry.  It's all right.  All right, go now.  Go now.  Go now.  No.  Go.  Go.  I don't think that works.  That's mean.  How do they count out the steps?  They find subways, and oh, my God.  They make it home.  We're proud of those people.  They make it home.  Yeah.  All their other senses are heightened, maybe.  Maybe that's it.  But do you get freaked out, though, when they're doing that little stick? 
[00:59:00]  I'm just thinking, they're dragging that through dog shit and spit, and then they put it on  their rug.  Oh, God.  You're right.  Yeah, I guess.  Well, maybe they just put it in a little thing and use it outside.  Yeah, blind people are pretty fucking amazing.  Maybe they have the outdoor cane and the indoor cane.  Oh, okay.  You know?  Oh, you know what?  I would do.  That's pretty smart.  Put it in a cane holder as you can go in your front door and grab the nice one.  The nice, clean cane.  The nice, clean one.  And then you have a shit cane for outside.  Sure.  Do you have a holiday cane? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, striped.  Yeah.  A little striped action.  Yeah, that's what I saw.  The cloudy eye yesterday.  Oh, God.  She looked like she had kind of like a lizard eye or something, and it was only one.  Cool.  I was so close to taking a picture.  Oh.  So close.  That's not nice.  But it's just because it's fascinating to me to see stuff I've never seen before.  Her zombie eye.  It wouldn't be nice, right?  No.  Probably not.  She'd probably be like, oh, look. 
[01:00:00]  God, I miss that gene.  She's just trying to be.  I just don't have that gene.  She's trying to exist.  Yeah.  This guy's snapping pictures with my wacky eye.  Yeah.  What about the guy pissing on the subway that you tweeted?  Oh, God.  What a fucking pig.  That guy scared the shit out of me.  Oh, he looked like a problem.  Just watching that video, I was kind of scared.  He looked like a problem.  Absolutely.  Some guy sitting on the subway.  Was it LiveLeak that had that one?  Yeah.  Because I don't think YouTube allows peeing videos.  No.  Oh, it was LiveLeak. 
[01:00:30]  And he just pulls his dick out and just pisses from the sitting position all over the floor  of the subway.  But he's peeing on himself, too.  Oh, yeah.  On himself.  Obviously, you have to be.  Just another fucking mental case.  Yeah.  Lunatic.  Another fucking...  But he looks angry.  Oh, yeah.  That is a thing of anger, yeah.  Oh, boy.  He looks like he's got a problem.  He's got issues.  Yeah.  Where is it, Sam?  Stop not finding it.  Go to LiveLeak.  Literally.  Go to Ant's Twitter.  Yeah, Ant and Sam.  He tweeted it.  Yeah.  What are you doing? 
[01:01:00]  Stop fucking around with it on wrestling sites.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop looking at Hulk Hogan.  That's...  Look at my pictures.  There's the...  There's the fucking rectal exam that...  The prostate.  The Dr. Steve brought in.  Yeah, the prostate exam.  Right.  Yeah.  Prostate.  Prostate.  I always add that R on that word.  I don't know why.  What?  I know it's prostate.  What do you say?  Prostrate.  Sometimes.  Ah, geez.  My prostrate there.  And I do know.  Yeah.  That's like a professional...  Prostrate. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  You find it?  Sam, what are you doing?  You're not...  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, that was him.  Sam, where is it?  Something about a zoo.  That was him.  Come on, Sam.  Click on that.  What the fuck's the matter with you?  Sam, stop fucking around.  What are you doing, Sam?  No.  Sam, you're ruining it.  No, that's not it.  It's the one where you commented that he's a zoo animal or something.  Yeah, live leak fucking video.  Right there.  Yep.  There he is.  He just won't do it. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God, Sam.  Yep, right there.  Oh, Sam.  Sam, what are you...  You're not helping.  Right there.  There it is.  Yep.  Ah.  You're not 18.  Oh, Jesus.  Looks like Kanye.  Yeah, he's a problem.  Ugh.  He's just peeing.  What the fuck?  Imagine saying, hey, you fucking asshole, what are you doing?  You're just charging you and biting your genitals off?  Yeah, well, you just gotta worry about a knife or a razor. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  See, looking at the camera, it's hard to tell.  What a fucking pig.  It's just an animal.  An animal.  Ugh.  Yeesh.  Yeah.  Probably smells great.  How great would it be to see a cop come and take a nightstick and crack it across his forehead?  Oh, that'd be great.  Bam.  And then they'd sue the police department.  Bratality.  Yeah.  Uh, so, Criss Angel.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, Criss Angel.  You're watching his new show on Spike, huh?  Yeah.  Now, I have a theory, and it's only because the show is so utterly bad. 
[01:03:00]  It's Criss Angel, you know.  He's, you know, the big Vegas magician.  And, uh, he's doing these unbelievable stunts and fucking magic and illusions and whatnot.  And it's called Believe.  Right.  But they capitalize the A-L-I-E in Believe.  Right.  So it says Lie.  So I'm speculating, only because this can't possibly be someone's idea of good magic and illusions, 
[01:03:30]  that it's all done on purpose.  Like, hey, assholes, look at me.  I'm doing horrible magic.  I'm lying.  This isn't Believe.  It's a lie.  It's, it's obviously I'm faking all of these.  Now watch.  I, I, because I can't imagine anyone thinks.  He's not that clever.  Can I see that insignia?  Or the, uh.  He's not that clever, and he's, that's probably his way around lawsuits in some weird way. 
[01:04:00]  I don't know.  It's so, he's so bad.  You think too much of him.  He's not that clever.  He's not that clever.  I like the guy too.  He came in.  He was cool enough.  He's great.  He liked us, but this is just horrendous.  Don't try this at home.  Where's the belief today?  I want to see that.  Oh.  Okay.  Episode of Believe.  Believe.  Is that right?  Oh, you nailed it.  I want to pay homage to Houdini by attempting an escape with two straitjackets. 
[01:04:30]  While suspended high in the air with weight around my neck.  That's putting pressure in your carotid artery.  No.  Two straitjackets, huh?  That thing.  Yeah.  How are you going to hang like that?  Mystery jackets.  It's Justin.  He's probably going to kill this weight.  I would just come.  You're going to come in here, right?  Oh, he goes back to his little Long Island home.  And why is mommy worried?  I don't know if I'm going to be successful, because I attempt to be the first person to 
[01:05:00]  escape two jackets, and I'll be 50 pounds around my neck.  If he died, we'd have heard about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a 50-pound weight around his neck with a noose.  Oh, look.  He's on top of a Luxor.  And then, uh-oh.  Look.  He's going to levitate.  He's just flying.  He flies.  He's an amazing flying man.  Look. 
[01:05:30]  Look.  People are looking up like, oh, my God.  He's floating in midair.  Chris Angel, believe.  It looks like all the letters are the same size.  Yeah.  But on other graphics, they show them where it's fly is bigger.  Right.  How is he not scared of being up that high?  I would be.  Because he's attached to a crane with cables. 
[01:06:00]  He can't get hurt.  Right.  All sorts of wires and shit.  Yes.  And there's nothing to worry about.  Right.  So what did he do last night that bothered you?  See, look.  The lie is, like, highlighted on the side of the Luxor.  Well, last night, they do the marathon before the big new episode, and I watched the one that  I had missed, which is him bringing a dead person back to life.  All right.  Was the person really dead?  Can't you look that up?  It was Shaq. 
[01:06:30]  It was Shaq Balloon all over again.  Oh, no.  It was a dummy.  Right.  It was a dummy or something laying on the table.  Right.  And it was supposed to be some kind of cadaver.  Why wouldn't they use a real dead guy?  Well, because they couldn't, you wouldn't even get past the censors to say, we're going  to show a real dead guy on a fucking gurney.  Well, that would make the illusion way more impressive.  And then you take the dead guy's clothes, put it in another guy that sort of looks like  him, and you're good to go.  Obviously a fake. 
[01:07:00]  So how does he handle this?  With fake people in the audience.  No, but how does he try to sell that it's an actual dead guy?  He just sells it.  He goes, ah, here's the dead body.  What?  I've got to see a little of this.  Oh, you've got to.  It's probably just a live person.  It could be a live person in makeup.  See, that's supposed to be the dead body.  I love the pants for the faces.  Oh, yeah.  Skeptics, paranormal experts, and medical experts to prove beyond any doubt what they're 
[01:07:30]  about to experience.  A guy in makeup.  He's real.  This gentleman, he's in his early 50s.  You can tell that he's had an autopsy.  I don't know how they describe.  It's the deceased individual.  Why is the video frozen?  Why can't we just watch the video?  Why is the video frozen?  It's just frozen.  Chris Angel froze it.  The whole place of business.  The devices we brought today, K2 EMF meter.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  What? 
[01:08:00]  They got paranormal experts in the room, and they have these certain meters and gauges  and whatnot that they put up by the dead guy, and they just start jumping like crazy.  It looks like an ohm meter and fucking volt meters and stuff you pick up at Radio Check.  No, it's a life meter, buddy.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yes, it is.  This was so fucking fake.  And, like, I have to tell people it's fake that he didn't bring a dead guy back to life. 
[01:08:30]  Of course he didn't.  But it's done poorly.  Do you know how much big news that would be?  Right.  It would be huge.  If he brought a dead guy back to life for real?  He would be the Messiah.  Yeah, exactly.  He wouldn't have a good night's sleep.  He's basically saying he's Christ.  Yes, he's Christ.  People would be pounding at his door all night long.  No one's covering him.  But, I mean, your point, because people go, of course it's fake.  Our point here is that these illusions are done horribly.  Yeah, they're done very poorly.  It's done with camera tricks, bad makeup, and actors that are supposed to be there. 
[01:09:00]  Horrible reaction shots.  What's going on.  Right.  He then, I guess, made some elephants disappear last night.  And, all right.  Yes.  But the elephants, of course, are behind the curtains in a big open field.  And then he made sure he put a ring of bystanders, witnesses, around the curtains with the elephants in the middle. 
[01:09:30]  And they were all, like, cuffed together.  Right.  So, you can't sneak the elephants out past these people.  Right.  But, meanwhile, you've seen so many of these that you know everyone that's involved is fake.  Or they just do the famous David Copperfield trick.  They just rotate the stage until the Statue of Liberty disappeared.  This was totally different.  You know that one, right?  Did people know that they were doing it?  I think the Copperfield, they, no.  They had a stage that slowly moved.  And the Statue of Liberty, they covered it. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Covered the view with, like, tapestries or curtains or whatever.  And then they slowly had a turntable that the audience was on.  And then they opened up the, you know, the curtains.  And, of course, the Statue of Liberty is now gone.  There's no way the audience didn't notice, oh, there's a giant statue 30 degrees to our  right.  No, because the curtain that was blocking it was now blocking the Statue of Liberty.  And where it actually was now.  It was actually kind of clever on his part.  At that time, yeah. 
[01:10:30]  At that time, it was kind of clever.  How do you not feel that you don't notice the cityscape behind you?  Unless they go towards the Jersey way where you can't see it.  Well, he figured out an angle where it would be tough to tell, I guess.  Yeah.  And the curtains are placed like they're supposed to be.  You know, the biggest challenge there was trying to figure out how to move the stage  without anyone really noticing it.  Yeah.  It's an impossibility.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't think they were in on it.  I really believe that, you know.  Yeah, I don't think that audience was in on it.  No.  But everybody, I mean, you can't cuff people together, have them surrounding some elephants, 
[01:11:00]  and then all of a sudden the elephants really disappear.  When you do tricks like that, the thing, whatever you're trying to make disappear is always  brought away from where it was, away from the cameras or the audience.  Right.  Through some kind of, you know, deception.  Yes.  Magic.  But since we start using curtains and stuff, I'm out.  The curtains in it.  Because you're like, okay, that's part of the trick.  People that are in on it.  It's such a gag.  Why not just make it disappear while we're looking at it?  Exactly.  That's a good point.  There.  Be magical. 
[01:11:30]  What's with the curtain?  Stupid curtain.  Well, in the old days, I guess it made sense in some weird way, but now it's like, as soon  as you use the curtain, I'm done with you.  So done.  Yeah.  The dumb curtain.  There's got to be other ways to do your illusions.  You're right.  Yeah.  Why do you need the curtain if you're so fucking brilliant?  Wouldn't you want people to see it just kind of disappear?  He tried to sell the curtain as another thing that could keep...  Needed?  Yeah.  He needed?  Well, that could keep the elephants from going out the back.  You'd see the curtains move.  We'd see them if they moved.  I know.  I don't need a fucking curtain to tell me that a six-ton animal is moving. 
[01:12:00]  But that's our point again.  Yes.  It's how these illusions are done.  That's so stupid.  Yeah.  You want people to believe ridiculous things.  Yeah.  That's the reason he's using a curtain?  Get the fuck out of here.  And then they showed his...  He went home to Long Island and I guess Long Island, his original house.  Was he born and raised on Long Island?  I think so.  Yeah?  Because it looked like Long Island.  Right.  Yeah.  He's a Long Island guy.  Yeah.  And he's there with his mom and his brother and all. 
[01:12:30]  And I'm thinking, oh, God, we bash him and maybe his brother listens or something.  Yeah.  It looked kind of bad.  Yeah.  I know.  But he's not taking care of his brother if he's still living in some shitty house in Brentwood.  How about you make money appear for your family?  Yeah.  Get him the fuck out of Long Island or get him into a better town.  All of his illusions are done so, like, they're so obvious.  And the acting is so bad.  He walks up to a building at one point and he sees, like, this dove, this whatever, pigeon, 
[01:13:00]  white dove, whatever it is.  Right.  And it had flown into the window and snapped its neck.  And it was laying on the ground, flapping a little bit, just twitching blood.  And they go, oh, no, his head is severed from his body.  And the woman that's with him is like, oh, oh, and acting so bad.  And a couple walks up and they're like, that's Criss Angel.  Oh, it looks so bad. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, God.  And then he pulls the fake head off of the pigeon thing.  Right.  And then the little pigeon body goes out of frame.  Right.  So that he could put his arm back and grab a pigeon that has its head tucked under the  wing like they do it.  Right.  So it looks like it doesn't have a head.  And then he's, like, pushing the head back on it.  And he's shaking.  And then the wings start flapping.  And he, oh, it's alive.  Ugh.  That was last night, too?  It was part of the marathon.  It wasn't last night's episode. 
[01:14:00]  Let me see the dead guy thing.  It's so bad.  How long is the dead guy?  It was much too long, but.  We've been parted.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Very apparent in those meters.  In those meters.  That manifests itself.  That manifests itself.  Okay, would you turn on your devices?  I'm going to bring back the dead spotty.  And may I take them?  Those devices are horrible.  Life forms and spirits suffer on succotash.  Look at how horrible their devices are, though. 
[01:14:30]  I know.  They're little old meters from.  They look like just old TV remotes.  You're completely relaxed in itself.  What's why are they using a live person?  Feel.  You need her energy or something?  Yes, yes.  See.  Or is she now going to be dead?  He goes without a pulse for a while.  Physicality.  As the dead guy gets a pulse.  And his body, you see him start breathing.  Who would volunteer to be dead for a little while so the other guy comes back to life? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, B.  He assured her it was safe.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're right.  He said, I guarantee you, you will leave here exactly like you do.  Oh, okay.  He's like, okay.  Can I see your medical degree?  All right.  Yes.  Yes.  He tries to be so mystical.  Criss Angel's from Levittown.  That's coming in.  Levittown?  Did you feel something?  Touch his dick.  Yeah.  See?  He...  Now he's touching the dead guy and she's feeling it. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  What's going on?  Why does he touch his dick?  He keeps poking at his dick.  All I would do if I was a fucking mortician.  Poke the dicks.  Shame them.  Where are you at?  Shame them.  Where are you at?  At a park.  She's at a park.  She's got this long-winded story.  You see...  You see a bench.  Ah.  There's a man.  And there's a tree.  A big oak tree behind it.  It's blowing in the wind right now.  Do you feel that? 
[01:16:00]  What's this mean?  You see...  There's nothing.  A man.  Sitting on the bench.  Yes.  That's this dead guy.  I want you to approach that man, and you will discover that man is Robert Brooks.  I would like the use of two medical students.  May I use both of you, please?  Oh, two actresses.  I mean medical students.  Hey, hey.  Oh, two frumps. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Well, then place it onto your right hand, please.  Yeah, because you don't want to touch the fake dead guy.  And I want you to tap the glass in a couple of moments in the rhythm of her pulse.  As you feel the pulse.  Oh, God.  See?  I want you to tap the glass.  Put your hand on his neck.  Wow.  If you feel a pulse begin...  And Chuck Berry appears under it?  I want you to just interrupt me and tell me.  Right.  Here's the magic... 
[01:17:00]  He took his coat off, so here comes the magic stuff.  Here comes the magic.  Now he's standing between the girl and the dead guy, waving his arms out, of course, like  he does because he's magic.  He's looking like...  The pulse is slowing.  Uh-oh.  It is.  Look at those things.  The meters are going off.  What are they?  The old TV remotes.  Yeah.  He can't even come up with something that looks modern enough.  Turn on the EKG.  Looks like Gordon Gekko's cell phone.  Uh-oh.  They turned on the EKG.  You just killed a girl? 
[01:17:30]  Listen to the music.  Oh, my God.  Now the EKG is picking up.  He's breathing.  He's breathing.  Oh, my God.  It's a robot.  Look, his stomach's going in and out.  Yeah, there's some kind of embalming fluid coming out of his mouth.  Oh, the black lady just ran out of there.  Oh, she's all scared.  F***. 
[01:18:00]  Bad camera moves.  He sits the girl up.  There's a dummy.  Right.  Why?  She's crying.  He's holding her.  This is very good.  Like she isn't an actress.  Stop.  She's a lady of magic.  It's inexplicable.  I saw the chest rise.  Oh.  I have no explanation.  Supposed to be a doctor, that guy.  In your meters?  Did they...  He's going to have a tough time getting a gig after this?  Yes.  Yes, there was a definite break in the electromagnetic field.  Was there?  What field? 
[01:18:30]  There was some kind of a spirit presence.  What did you feel?  You're getting sucked out of the room.  I noticed tears in your eyes.  Tell me what's that's about.  I'm stupid.  Tears in your eyes, I guess.  As you raised the dead.  You're getting maced.  Love is so strong.  You saw the dead body through your tears.  Right.  Did you feel?  Felt out of breath.  Felt displaced.  I felt displaced.  Shut up. 
[01:19:00]  Why wouldn't they...  No, that feeling was, what the fuck am I doing here?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they have the fake guys, like, sit up?  Because that's too much.  Yeah.  Or was it a robot?  It was a robot.  Or was it an actual dead guy?  I think it was a robot.  It was a robot.  I think it was a, yeah, fake dead guy.  Yeah.  It was a shack balloon with a little thing inside that made his diaphragm look like it  was moving to breathe.  So why?  And just pumps fluid out of the mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  So why bring him back to being dead, then?  Because the woman... 
[01:19:30]  But he has his power, so why not say, fuck it, let's make this guy dead now?  See, here's the gimmick.  The woman has to be there.  She said that you need to take someone's life in order to give someone back that life.  Life force.  So he could have kept the dead guy alive, but then the woman would have been dead.  But that would be damn impressive.  Well, yeah.  He's like Frankenstein.  And then wheel out the broad as a dead person now.  Yeah.  If you really want to freak people out.  I'm sorry.  Leave him hanging, and then have that guy sit up and walk out of the room. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, the guy that's been dead for a week.  He's fucking rotting.  He's got the autopsy scar on him.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just bought that dead body at a Halloween store.  Oh.  It's not true, Sam.  It's true.  He's a man of magic.  Every one of his dumb tricks are like this, and it's so obvious that I am starting to  think that the whole show is just a put-on.  But what's the payoff?  Maybe the final episode, season episode, season finale.  And he's lying to everybody. 
[01:20:30]  And it kind of shows people how he did some of this shit, because that would be kind of  cool.  That would ruin his career.  No.  That would ruin his career.  It might.  Because after this is over, he's still got a huge show in Vegas.  There's no way that that's what this is.  Maybe he's doing shitty tricks so that he can reveal them at the end, because he doesn't  want to reveal his good tricks.  Right.  Just go look.  You know, I really do have magic in my blood, but I also do shitty tricks.  These are all camera tricks.  That's not a magician.  I remember with an 8mm camera making it look like you disappeared. 
[01:21:00]  That's not a magician.  No.  Just fucking stop the camera, move out of the way, and restart the camera.  But his concepts are just stupid.  She has to die for, what, 30 seconds to see this guy's chest start moving up and down?  So he's a temporary murderer.  He killed her for 30 seconds.  He killed her for 30 seconds.  Shouldn't he get a year for that?  Shouldn't he get a year for that in jail?  Should get something.  You can't kill someone temporarily without consequences.  You want magic?  How about you make two sandwiches and peeling my lunch pail? 
[01:21:30]  How about you get a job in on time, right?  How about you, yeah, you want magic?  How about you get the electricians to do their job?  That's a good one.  Yeah, I know.  Sad but true.  I think this is why David Blaine does like a big trick once every two or three years.  Right.  Because when you've got to do one every week, you just put shit on TV.  That's nice language.  That's shit.  Sorry.  It's shit.  It's utter shit.  The Shaq balloon is still the greatest thing ever.  Yeah.  That he's done. 
[01:22:00]  Maybe that'll be the season finale that will be like, well, Carrot Top had this Shaq balloon.  You know, people...  Hey, let me borrow it.  Our followers were killing Criss Angel over Shaq balloon.  We're just killing him in not one response from any Criss Angel fan or Criss Angel himself.  He just got killed.  We'll wait till they see Dead Mannequin.  Dead Mannequin.  Dead Mannequin is good.  Yeah.  Dead Mannequin.  Yeah.  He doesn't have the same ring as Shaq balloon.  No, Shaq balloon is the best.  All right.  Yeah.  So that was my evening. 
[01:22:30]  How did he do the elephant thing?  I don't know.  I'm just thinking that they had the ring of people around the elephants.  They pull up the curtains around the elephants.  Could you show me that, Sam?  And then they say, drop the curtains and the elephants are gone.  I'm sure there's just a camera cut somewhere.  Right.  Like he cuts the camera.  Cuts the camera.  Gets rid of the elephants.  That's it.  I want to see the quick setup and then the reveal.  It's outside.  Maybe you can see where the shadows are.  Yeah.  Maybe we can figure out how long it actually is.  Follow the shadows.  That's where Copperfield blew it for me at his Vegas show.  I just got one question. 
[01:23:00]  Are you ready?  What is he doing here?  What is he doing here?  It's going to make the elephants disappear.  Elephants on a football field.  They're surrounded by drapes.  Oh, I thought he was in the safari.  Oh.  He can't even do that.  They don't have a travel budget.  No.  That's great.  These abused, beaten animals.  Poor things.  The shadows are definitely going with the...  The elephants could already be gone. 
[01:23:30]  The yard line.  Yeah.  Like, he puts up three walls.  Oh.  There they are.  All right.  All right.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Raise up the front curtain.  Let's do this, bad boy.  All right.  So now the fourth curtain goes up.  Fourth curtain goes up.  Right.  Kristen.  Raise to me, Kristen.  Are you up to me?  And the people make a chain on three out of the four sides?  No.  They're all around, aren't they? 
[01:24:00]  No.  Here's a peanut.  No.  None of these shots are steady shots.  No.  They all have breaks in them.  Right.  Right.  Any one of these, they just simply put the wall down and have the elephants walk away.  Exactly.  Of course.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I'm going to give you a peanut.  There you go.  There's a peanut.  There you go.  Are you ready?  I'm fucking ready.  Yeah.  Someone dug a hook into the elephant's fucking nose and pulls it out. 
[01:24:30]  The elephants are gone.  They just walked away.  All right.  So it's obvious what's going on here.  They got the crowd on only one side.  So the people making the chain are obviously in on it.  And then the elephants go out the back.  Right.  Or they're just splicing this applause for something else.  Right.  Yes.  No, because they try to use the real people to, you know, they would have seen the elephants  to sell the illusion. 
[01:25:00]  Not if you know it.  You could take them straight back out and they're not going to see them at all.  Look how it's set up.  You saw the YouTube video, too, where he was fucking up his tricks.  Right.  And they said the louder you cheer, the more likely you are to be on television.  Right.  Here's what I've heard they do.  The people in the human chain are in on it.  That's obvious.  Yeah, yeah.  They're in on it.  The audience could see the elephants and they put up the final, what do they call it?  The fourth wall.  The fourth wall.  Yeah.  And as they put up the final wall that's right in front of the people that they want to trick, 
[01:25:30]  they drop the back wall and the elephants just walk straight out of the fucking stadium.  I don't believe that.  It was a man of magic.  They were all cuffed.  That's all.  And they do things where the audience sometimes sees how phony it is, but they're applauding  for the preliminary act.  Right.  He'll do some kind of amazing thing to get the reaction shot.  But my problem is if you're in on this audience shot, right away I'm like, oh, we're only  allowed to stay here.  This is ridiculous. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it is ridiculous.  And everyone's trying to figure out magic tricks these days, so you've got to trick them  better.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  As soon as you know you can only stay in one area, you know exactly how the trick is  done.  Exactly.  There is no trick here.  You're just like, okay, stop the camera, stop the camera.  That's what I think.  I don't know.  No, I think they just walked them out the back.  Let's see where they could have walked the elephants.  They could have walked them out the back easily.  Let me see.  It's a big open seat.  Go to the setup shot again, because I want to see what's behind. 
[01:26:30]  Okay, they're right there.  Yeah, see, they can walk right out.  There's nothing stopping them from just walking all the way to the goal line.  Yeah, but somebody would see them.  Yeah, you'd see them on one.  Look at how tight.  David, the crowd is on one side, and they're squished even together.  But you can't be done, but I want to see where they're going.  Yeah, they can make noise.  The other might make noise, walking out.  Instead of having the people 10 to 12 deep, why would they spread them all the way out  to the sidelines?  They don't want them near the sidelines, obviously. 
[01:27:00]  Why wouldn't you give them a better vantage point?  Unless you don't want them in that area.  They'd have to leave the curtains up for like 15 minutes.  Well, that's the thing.  See, that's where the edit is for the TV show.  Just cutting all that time.  Yeah, so he must be fucking around, blah, blah, blah, giving the elephants time to do  it, and then they do it in post, the quick edit.  But where do they go, to the left or the right once they reach the end?  They go straight out, man.  Where, though?  Where after the end zone?  There's trees there.  It just keeps going.  Oh, my God. 
[01:27:30]  There's no seats.  That's a mile away.  But that's the trick.  He probably takes his damn time, you know, yapping with the crowd, joking with them and  stuff.  I don't know about that.  I'm telling you, dude.  I think it's just pure camera.  Yeah.  I do, too.  I think it's an edit to take.  It probably takes five minutes to get them out of there, and they probably, you know,  chop it down in the edit to a quick, you know, 30 seconds.  But somebody, here's my thing.  Those drapes are not high enough to conceal all the way back.  Like, the drapes, if that was 20 feet. 
[01:28:00]  The people who are on the ground, you're not going to see over the drapes ever.  I still don't think you can conceal that far back.  The giveaway is the people aren't all the way to the sidelines.  He's forcing them to be 10, 12 back.  Right.  So he doesn't want them on the sidelines, obviously.  Because then you would see them in the distance.  Where do they go, though?  Let's say the offense goes straight back.  They go straight back, obviously.  There's a scoreboard, I think.  It's probably something right under the scoreboard is where, is the out.  It's just a truck there, and they get into the truck and drive away. 
[01:28:30]  Maybe.  Or behind those trees.  It's the, look at the sideline.  That's the giveaway.  Why doesn't he want them by the sideline?  I see here what you're saying here, that they stop at midfield.  Maybe they turn them to the right.  Huh?  Maybe they go out and then turn them around that corner.  But people would see, but somebody would, I think the risk of being seen is too big.  No, he already figured that out by not having them all the way to the sidelines.  I'm going to obsessively say that over and over again.  Because look at the vantage point for most of these people. 
[01:29:00]  They have five, six, seven, eight people in front of them.  Right?  They're playing again to show the crowd.  Because all those people would not be in on it.  The people that are making the human chain have to be in on it.  See, those people, you've got to know, are in on it.  The human chain.  So let's blow them off.  But you can't have the whole stadium in on it. 
[01:29:30]  You can come around here.  You're going to bend around the contour of the curtain.  Those are all his friends.  Family members of his staff.  You see how narrow of the viewing area is?  And he forces people to be way the fuck back.  Look.  The human chain hand-possed to each other.  He set that up purposely.  Go back one second, Tim.  Watch.  This is why I'm not sure about that.  Because when you go here, if there was something right behind them, I would...  But go right to where they show that back angle.  Where can they go? 
[01:30:00]  They just walk straight back.  They take their fucking time.  And then in post, he cuts down what probably was a 10-minute bullshit session with him.  There's a fence back there.  And make it quick.  Right?  Yeah, that is a fence behind the trees.  What happens is you go back there...  You can't really see if there's an exit at the fence or anything.  You can't see.  They'd have to turn to the right, but they may turn to the right.  All right, maybe they do.  You know, there's a reason why he doesn't have them all the way out to the side.  Right.  Period.  You can see how much longer the shadows are. 
[01:30:30]  If you had to wait that long, the shadows would have been...  I mean, how long does it take elephants to go?  It looks like 40 yards, maybe.  But, you know, that could be less than five minutes, really.  That's a couple minutes.  It's crazy.  And then he just edits that down in post with a cut shot.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think camera...  I think his camera's the simplest solution.  Yeah.  It's the ease...  Like, he does something to get them crazy, and I think...  We're going to have to agree to disagree on this one, gentlemen.  I think it's...  I think that's...  They're not selling me on that.  I think he would have gotten... 
[01:31:00]  Because I think he needs some people that are not in on it.  Oh, I don't think that the audience is in on it at all.  Right.  I agree with you.  I think they're not in on it, but I think they're cheering for something else, and he's  just splicing that together like they're cheering for the amazing trick.  Because I don't see how you would...  What's that?  You walk...  You walk him straight back, and then, you know, the exit I'm not really sure of, but...  Are we ready?  Yeah.  Raise up the front...  He even makes the shot of the audience tight, like they could be all the way to the sidelines.  Raise it up. 
[01:31:30]  Raise it up.  Kristen!  Wave to me, Kristen!  Are you up there?  Wave.  Mm-hmm.  So there's the cut.  Yeah, they keep cutting.  That's the cut, because they need to cut down the time of the illusion.  And look, they're only tightly in the center of the field.  Can't even drop the curtain, right? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, it's straight back, period.  See, look, why would you have people 20 deep?  Well, they could be on the sidelines.  Especially if it doesn't matter, if you're going to do a cut shot.  Let me say hi to Jessica in New Jersey.  Jessica.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, Jessica.  So, the math magician did a thing on this trick, where, like, they show you how he does it. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  You can find a clip online.  It's basically like there's a fake scenery that they put the elephant behind, so you can't see him with camera angles.  A fake what?  A fake scenery.  A fake scenery.  Yeah, so he doesn't really go that far away.  He's, like, maybe 30 feet away, you know?  And he's hiding behind what looks like big trees.  This is an outdoor thing in a football stadium.  Unless there's just a camera motion.  A fake fucking scoreboard or something.  Like, it's just fake.  All right, here's magic revealed, and it looks very similar to... 
[01:33:00]  Let's do the exact same trick.  Okay.  All right.  ...with the magician, seeing exactly what the witness has seen.  Wow.  Nothing unusual here.  No.  Other than a man in a red shirt and a scary black mask.  Wow.  We've now walked to the other side of the sheets.  Is this the Chris Angel trick?  There's nothing extra...  I mean, it looks like...  Or is this that trick in general, or is he specifically addressing Chris Angel?  No, I don't think he's...  No, I mean, the Chris Angel trick...  No, that's the problem with Chris Angel.  He does a lot of tricks that have been done a million fucking times, too.  That's how you know he's a hack, like...  He's trying to put his own little spin on it.  But there is... 
[01:33:30]  He's not even doing his own spin.  The curtains even look the same.  Exactly.  The best magician has already shown how to do this trick.  That's why Penn and Teller are brilliant.  Yeah.  Because they spend ridiculous amounts of time coming up with new illusions.  They actually create.  And they're not satisfied until it's done perfectly.  Illusions.  And then they finally bring it to the public.  Penn has said many times on our show, some of these things they do, it takes years...  Yeah.  ...for them to figure it out right.  Let's see what this guy is up to.  The magician commands his assistants to bring in the sides of the sheet, forming a large, 
[01:34:00]  three-sided box.  Now to close it up.  He commands the smaller sheet to be raised to form the front of the box.  Okay.  Not much of a trick, but there it is.  A big, fabric box in the middle of a parking lot.  Yeah, a trick.  Maybe he's not done.  He tells his assistants to hang on firmly to the large sheets as they battle the wind.  This is the high cost of doing a trick outside.  That's exactly what...  One final command for the TV audience to keep our eyes on the box, and the magician prepares 
[01:34:30]  to reveal the results of his conjuring.  Oh, my God.  Let's watch.  What do you know?  A five-ton elephant.  Oh, it's the reverse.  Yeah, he makes it appear.  Where did he come from?  He was definitely not on the witness list.  No.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  The girls are impressed.  Maybe the masked magician can do real magic after all.  This is the exact same trick.  Yeah.  They said Chris Angel seems to reverse it.  So how does the magician make the elephant appear from nowhere? 
[01:35:00]  I know.  I see how you do it.  In the middle of the lot.  They cut a hole in the parking lot, and they lower it, and then they raise the elephant,  and then they quickly have a truck come in and seal it up.  And re-pave it.  The fucking thing walks from the back.  That's obvious.  Let's see what he says.  And that's what Chris Angel did.  By spectators.  Is that tree fake back there?  It sounds impossible.  It is.  Here are the secrets.  Oh.  First off, let's start with a group of spectators. 
[01:35:30]  The secret here is...  They're in on it.  They're all in on the tree.  All right.  So far, I'm right.  The magician has no trouble positioning them in a circle since they've been rehearsed.  Right.  This 360-degree walk is designed to convince us that the parking lot is empty and free of wandering elephants.  There you go.  Next, the large sheet is raised.  Again, we can see the surrounding parking lot appears empty, but appearances are deceiving.  We know he had to be hiding somewhere in this vast, seemingly empty lot. 
[01:36:00]  But where?  We've been looking at his hiding place the entire time.  What?  Don't you remember seeing it?  You did.  What?  Constructed near a group of trees by the edge of the lot is a painted Hollywood backdrop and some fake trees.  Holy shit.  This is the elephant's hiding place.  Sound far-fetched?  It's true.  And chances are, it fooled you.  Even though this looks like a setup that a cartoon roadrunner might use to trick a Wile E. Coyote, 
[01:36:30]  it's actually an effective hiding place for the elephant and his trainer.  No one would ever expect a real pachyderm could be stashed away behind some phony trees in the middle of a parking lot,  completely undetected.  Well, in the middle of a football field.  Right.  The farther away the camera travels, the more deceptive the phony setup looks.  There you go.  See it now?  When you know it's there, it's much easier to spot.  Yes.  The trick is that you didn't see it the first time because you didn't know where to look. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  This continuous camera angle from the illusion is low and only shows the front side of the sheet.  The trick only works from this perspective because as the sheet is raised, the elephant begins to approach from the rear.  So Angel just walked the elephants out the back.  Right.  We should walk that again.  You can see the elephant walking.  And the key here is that it takes some time.  So that's where you guys are right with the fucking edit. 
[01:37:30]  To knock down the time from whatever would take two minutes to get the elephants out.  I think Obie's absolutely right.  Maybe there's a fake.  If there's a fake thing put in, that's definitely possible.  Well, a fake thing.  There was no way he was walking them that far.  But this makes sense  I think he can also just walk them that far  And just get rid of it in the edit  Let's see now that we know to look for it  Let's see if we can find this secret hiding place  For four elephants  Oh there it is  That fat woman's vagina  Oh sorry 
[01:38:00]  It's going to be hard to  To see the fake area though  On TV like this  So you can blend it in  It's probably the scoreboard  It probably is the scoreboard  Do we know what field that is?  No  Not offhand  All high school probably  But all it has to be is the trees 
[01:38:30]  Right  Yeah  Giving the illusion that the trees are way far  Wait a minute maybe it's the scoreboard  It could be  Wait it looks like there's a scoreboard in front of the scoreboard  It could be  Doesn't it?  Yeah  That is something  It looks like there's something in front of the actual scoreboard  Looking like another scoreboard  Like between the goalposts?  Yeah  Yeah  Wait hold on  Missouri State  That's Missouri State  So let's take a real look at the real Missouri State  Field and see if that's 
[01:39:00]  Trying to debunk this  Yeah something fake  It was obvious  It was obvious  He walked the elephants out the back  Mmm  So obvious  Yeah  I mean he had to  Be real here  Because I mean the people in the human chain  Yes  You got it  They're in on it obviously  But you can't have the whole crowd in on it  Because you do want some fucking dummies in their reactions  Is that the scoreboard right there?  Okay so this is where he was in the middle of the field 
[01:39:30]  There looked to be more trees  Yeah there were definitely more trees  More trees  Yeah  There's no real trees  Wait a minute  It goes right to a parking lot  It goes right to  It looks like from the other angle  It might be a scoreboard  Unless the other side has the trees  Yeah try to get the full field  Maybe that whole fence area was fake  To the left of the scoreboard  There were more trees  A lot of trees  That goes right to a lot  The parking lot was definitely on this side  Unless there's parking lots on both sides  Check the other side and just see  See if you got a better shot of the stadium  Yeah the whole field  Come on Sam you're not finding it 
[01:40:00]  Why you think there'd be two scoreboards?  Oh yeah there is probably  Oh look  It has to be  I don't know  There's no real trees  There's no trees on either side really  There's some  It's not the park  We were just looking at the parking lot side  Right  So the other side has even less trees  So this is  What we were just looking at  Yeah  This is 100% the same area  Now let's see  And there's no trees look  There was all trees back here  Come on  So the scoreboard isn't fake 
[01:40:30]  But the trees right behind the scoreboard are fake  Look at it  Look it's all trees  What the hell is that  Chris Angel's so fake  There's an elephant behind those trees  Come on  Nice  Now let's see  I want to see if they can pick it up  So they did walk quite a way  They probably did  Yeah  But they had a lot of elephants  So I mean  But Chris Angel's really good at distracting the crowd  It fools around with them a little bit  And they hid him behind all those fake trees  Which are a lot closer than they appear  And the whole thing 
[01:41:00]  No they're not  No because you could see the end zone  Or the track that goes around the stadium  That's pretty obvious  They're at least behind that  So they're at least behind that  So I really believe they had to walk them a real long way  Big elephant footprints  See they had to walk them all the way to  Yeah that's similar  There's no trees at all  There's absolutely no fucking trees  Find me the other side too  So the trick goes like this  It took a while to get the elephants out the back  Chris Angel babbles for a while with the crowd  And then in post they go to that cut 
[01:41:30]  To chop down the actual time it took  Where he asked that guy like  Oh you've got to hold on  Because the wind is blowing it or something  He did say something to one of the  Right so that was the distraction for the people  And that probably went a lot longer than they showed on TV  And I think he'd get the elephants out within two minutes  Probably within a minute to be honest with you  A little over a minute maybe  But for TV that's a long time  That's pretty funny  You can take ten minutes  He can distract the crowd for ten minutes  Yeah because he could fool around with other shit 
[01:42:00]  Because they're like  Okay the elephants are obviously in there  We see the human chain  So they're not  Swallowing a sword  Yeah they're not sitting there going  Why is this taking so fucking long  They don't care  If you can entertain them during that time  Oh that Chris Angel  What a piece of shit  But this is  I've got to say it again  I know we say the same shit over and over again at times on this show  But this is where he's a lazy fuck with his illusions  Yeah  Look how easy it was for us to just google image the stadium 
[01:42:30]  And see how the stadium is actually  And also just do a YouTube search for the magician  Man's magician reveal  Right  Reveals it  But as Chris Angel  That's your business  When you do that and go  Okay fuck  So people know how this trick's done  So now I've got to do it in a way where it tricks them  And where they go  Wait a minute  That's not how I saw it done  Or I've got to stop worrying about looking pretty  And actually think of a new trick  Right  Or  I've got to find a stadium that people can't look up online  Right  Because there's no trees at this fucking stadium 
[01:43:00]  No  Google it  Not like that anyway  No  Wow  He put a lot of trees in there  He put a lot of forest  What about those light  You see those light posts  Yeah it looks like in between the light posts  In between those light posts  Where there's a little shenanigan going on  What are those  Those like  What light posts  The uh  That and  Yeah  You mean the posts that are holding up the fucking facade  Thank you  So go back to the other shot  Yeah I'm pretty sure  Where do the real trees end  There's none of that there 
[01:43:30]  It's exactly  The real trees end where the light posts begin  Wait how do we know  Hold on  Wait you see the light posts in the actual stadium shot  No  No  Okay  Because that's where the trees are  How do we know that that's the  We're not looking at the other side  Because the other side is a field  And there are cars back here  Behind the trees  You see cars  Yeah we saw them  You can see them throughout the trick  I don't know  You can see right there  Look at this  What's that  Oh those are all the cars  Right so  There's a car right there  The parking lot is behind this 
[01:44:00]  Yeah so they're using the parking lot side  That you can look up online for yourself  This whole shit is fake  Right  And you see the  The actual poles  Where the fake scenery  Can you imagine if one of the trees  You couldn't even figure that out  The trees fell over  How great would that be if a tree blew over  That's pretty funny  It's held out by fake light posts  Now the fake light posts  Could you zoom in on that somehow  This I can't  Yeah cause I want to see how he blended the fake trees with the real trees  Yeah can you take a screen picture and then we can zoom in 
[01:44:30]  How do you do that  Go take a screenshot  I don't know I know you can fucking click  Right  I don't know what the pieces are  Cause I want to see how the trees are blended in  There's gotta be where to do it  I know  Or just make the  Yes  Maybe make the video full screen  Can you see anything  Enhance  Enhance  Enhance  Enhance  Enhance  You need some kind of a  Oh god 
[01:45:00]  Put an MS paint  Zoom in  Zoom in  Let's go  Oh man  Look at you  He's working this  You are working this keyboard  What are you doing  Who uses paint  Here we go  Okay  Alright let's see the screen  I don't mean you  Alright let's see this  Now we're zooming in  Zoom  Keep zooming  Alright hold on  Go to the sides  Okay  I do see  That right there  Look at the green on this tree  Versus the green on the  Yes  That is half a tree 
[01:45:30]  Half a fake tree  And there's so much more bright  Alright  Like look at the freshness  Of this green life  And then those trees  Oh no  Oh Chris  Look at  Oh Chris  I don't see any difference  Oh I can totally see it  You see how these trees  Are literally in front of those  Right  You can see the depth of field  Is totally different  From this tree to that tree  Zoom in again  Right  You know why  Because there's an elephant  Behind this one  Look at the bottom of it  Right 
[01:46:00]  Look at where it meets the ground  Look at this  It's a straight line  Yes  Like a facade  Right  Wow  That's a  What a hunk of shit  Now  The only thing  I add to this  Is  Could he be using real trees  Just to make the trick  A little different  I bet he could  You know what I mean  Just haul in a whole bunch  Of new trees  Fake trees  Fake trees  Yeah  Fake foliage  And real foliage  Painting  And then  And then  Yeah  That's also  I mean the mass magician  Had some real trees too  Yes he did  He did  But what an idiot 
[01:46:30]  That he doesn't realize  That everyone could just  Google these days  And you could google  The stadium the trick was in  And you could just see  How ridiculous it is  Exactly  Yeah there are real trees  In there  It's literally just a big version  Of the mass magician's facade  Right  He put some real trees  Real trees in front of the canvas  That needs to completely  Block the elephants  And then the canvas  Has fake shit on it  Fake trees and stuff  What a buffoon  Alright  We're just obsessed with this  I know  Yeah I know  You're right though  He did what  You're absolutely right  He walked him back 
[01:47:00]  We are obsessed  That's a false front  Well yeah  That was the only  Missing piece of the puzzle  Where's the exit  Yep  And he didn't have to  Put him on either side  But he could have done  This trick anywhere  Where it would have been  A lot harder to google  The place he was doing it at  At least block out  The big Missouri State thing  Right  He doesn't care  No  He's just trying to put together  Some cheap television  He doesn't care  He's just trying to put  His lies together  He's going to try to sell  Some Vegas tickets  Yeah  Alright now that we  Bored the hell out of the audience 
[01:47:30]  We got Brandon Steiner  Coming in  And he's going to give away  A lot of cool stuff  That's right  He's actually got me  I signed a bunch of  Baseballs and footballs  You did  Yes  Oh I can't wait to get those  We got some NHL  Game used hockey sticks  Steiner Sports NHL  Game used hockey stick  Ice scraper  I have no idea  What is he using  Old hockey sticks  And making ice scrapers  Out of them maybe  Iconic college coach  Bob Knight  Quote autographed piece 
[01:48:00]  Wow  That's like  A $500 value  Lou Holtz  Autographed play  Like a champion  Today  Photographed  Tom Brady  Unsigned  Walking with hands up  What?  I don't know what that is  Signed by somebody  I'm guessing the photographer  Signed by Hauser  Wings?  He'll explain this  Hauser  He'll explain this stuff  But stand by if you like sports memorabilia  Because you've got a very good chance of winning some stuff today  I want to welcome Brandon Steiner back to the old radio show 
[01:48:30]  Brandon  Here he comes  What's up sir?  Sorry to make you wait there  That works  You alright?  Oh that's the ice scraper  I was trying to figure out  Oh  So what you get the old NHL hockey sticks 
[01:49:00]  And you make ice scrapers out of them?  Well  Absolutely  I mean I'm sitting there  We're about to throw these things out  I'm like  Shit what the hell do we do with this?  Right  And then I'm like  Ice  Ice scraper  Ah  You know  See that's how you do it  You gotta pull out your ice scraper  With a hockey stick  See that's why  That's kind of smart man  Come up with a good idea  That's kind of cool  I hate to throw things out  Obviously I have some issues when it comes to that  Since I'm a kid frankly  And all those sticks have been used in NHL games? 
[01:49:30]  Yep  Yeah game use sticks  They're cool  Oh my god  They're going to sell like crazy  Funnel items  Just came out with it just a couple weeks ago  Do you know what game they were used in?  Or you don't go that far with it?  I didn't go that far with these  Because actually some of them are actually decent player sticks  They're just broken  These sticks are really expensive  Like 150 bucks  So I think we make like three or four of these scrapers  It's crazy  Out of a stick  Wow  But you know  Listen  You have the dirt  I'm trying to figure out ways  They could use the ice  Melt the ice down  We've sold a lot of grass 
[01:50:00]  You can make iced tea or something  You gotta do something with that  Yeah  We want to filter the water  We were thinking  If you won a championship game  Right  You know  Stanley Cup  Can you go melt the ice down  And filter that water  It would be cool to drink  Stanley Cup ice water  Well  It'd be kind of a limited  I'm thinking I'm not drinking that  Even if I was filtered  Yeah  Or how about you  We nixed that idea  Guys bleeding on the ice  Getting fucking hit with sticks  Or how about you get some water  And make believe it's the ice  You know  Who's gonna figure it out  Yeah  Yeah  I got kind of  How do you feel about those guys  The Rangers 
[01:50:30]  No there's a lot of  You know  A lot of fake guys  A lot of fake shit out there  No I'm feeling good about it  As a matter of fact  Tonight for the first time  A positive piece has been done  On collectibles  On Showtime 60 Minutes  Oh  And they did a nice little piece  On you know  They did a 60 Minutes Showtime  With just sports  Our arm contained  Who's  It's interesting  Because he had interviewed me  20 years ago  When I was like  In a little office  Probably about the size  Of the studio  It was my whole office  And then for him to come back  And do the retrospective 
[01:51:00]  It's 50,000 square feet now  It's very cool  Everybody's always  This in the collectible business  Brandon  20 years later  We're in that small studio  Yeah same  You guys are making  A lot of money though  Thanks for that  But you're making a lot of money  That's  We should be in a big space by now  We deserve it  Yeah I'm feeling  You could go with  A little bit of a bigger studio  I'm gonna  Add the bigger studio  A few years ago  Yeah  Anyway  I'm having a lot of fun  These days at Steiner  Yeah  And it's nice  That things are a little more  Under control  And I think  When I looked at 
[01:51:30]  I didn't see the whole piece  But even when I looked at the tease  I was like  Man  15 years ago  I mean  Everybody was like  Everything's fake  And this and that  But I think now  There's like an order to things  And I'd like to think  That had a little something  To do with it  You know  Working with MLB  And working with  Their authentication process  And obviously the Yankees  And some of the big teams  And players  Have entrusted me  60 minutes  That's pretty strong  I gotta get up there  I got the invite  To check out your joint  I still haven't done it  I gotta tell you  If we were dating 
[01:52:00]  I'd be in therapy  Now the amount of rejection  I've got  Oh man  I mean  I gotta go up there  I want to  How many times  Does a brother  Gotta invite you guys  I know  I wanna go up  And you'd love it up there too  I mean  This is a good time of year  You probably need  A couple Christmas gifts  Yeah I could use a couple  A couple things  A couple broken hockey sticks  But we did bring  Some really cool stuff  I got a football  In my office  That needs to be signed  By Dan Marino  Doable  Doable  Alright let's get that done  Love Dan  Do you guys want to get  George Foreman  Yeah  Every now and then  He doesn't sign a lot 
[01:52:30]  But you know  We got that grill man  It made him too much money  But every now and then  He'll sign some stuff  And we see some Foreman stuff  Opportunities come around  We'll be able to do that  You know what we're gonna be doing  Next month is Mike Tyson  Oh yeah  I'm interested to do something  With him at our signer store  In Roosevelt Field  And he draws a big crowd still  I mean he's amazing  Oh shit right  He draws a big crowd  No he's had a huge comeback  Yeah I mean  He does our show regularly now  He's got the one man show  You know  Which made it to HBO  The book is unbelievable 
[01:53:00]  It's a great read  And he gets new movies  He's amazing  Yeah  Yeah he figured it out  Oh that's a good one  So  Who else  Who else is big right now  Well you know  I'm kind of fortunate  To have Mariano Rivera  Oh yeah  On the wing  So we've had a great run  With him  We've had the whole  Mariano Rivera line  That's been just an amazing year  And you know  Peyton Manning  We just did a signing  With him yesterday in Denver  Yeah  It may take a little while  To get the stuff back  This is a snowstorm  In Denver right now  What was he signing  He signed some footballs  We did a special  What do you mean by some footballs 
[01:53:30]  How many does he sign  We did this special program  On Amazon  We did 150 footballs  And a flash special for them  And then we created these helmets  With him and Elway  Put him and Elway  On a helmet together  So we did  Oh wow  Elway happened to be  In the neighborhood  So we got a couple of his  Oh nice  If you're a Broncos fan  That's got to be cool  Yeah we love  We love Peyton  We've been with Peyton  For about five six years  Some ups and downs frankly  You're going to have  Geno Smith sign some shit  No  Some dog shit  Yeah we've been  Get it 
[01:54:00]  He stinks  Yeah we've been kind of  Staying a little bit  Careful with the jet thing  Thank God Sanchez  Who I wanted to sign  Coming out of school  You should have him  Sign clipboards  Rejected me  Rejected  Wouldn't let us sign him  No  So we're just so grateful  I sent him a thank you note  Actually for not letting me  Throw that money away  You would have lost money  On that deal  Yeah I would have lost money  On that deal  No question  You know we just signed  Carmelo Anthony  We're hoping the Knicks  Make a little comeback  But you know who just signed  You know who just signed  A deal with us  We're going to do a signing  Next week with him  This guy has never signed 
[01:54:30]  And I hate to admit this  On radio  I haven't told anybody  We did this  Because he's a Georgetown guy  But Patrick Ewing  Wow  Oh  It's weird  But he just never  Wanted to sign autographs  And finally  He gave in  He probably needs  A few bucks at this point  I don't know  I think you know  He's getting ready  To be a head coach  Building up his image  He's been getting ready  To be a head coach  For 10 years  No he's focused now though  But no one will  Fucking give him the shot  Maybe he's going to  Get the shot now  For the people that don't know  He's an assistant coach forever  For Charlotte  Yeah  For Charlotte  I tell you something 
[01:55:00]  I was surprised  I liked him  I've always  First of all  He's always been  A great basketball guy  A warrior  Probably underappreciated  Here in New York  Actually when I look back  On him  But he's taking the  Coaching thing a lot  More seriously  And supposed to be  Turning it up a notch  I always felt he should  Have coached in college  For a couple years  He's been a good initial step  Instead of the assistant  Do you really like  Carmelo Anthony  The Knicks will never  Win a championship with him  I'm biased  I'm a Syracuse guy  So I love Carmelo  He brought me my championship  In 2003  But he's a great player  But he doesn't make  People around him better  And that's what you need 
[01:55:30]  To win a title  You've got to have  The right people  Around you too  I still have confidence  In this team  Is going to get on a run  Oh you're crazy  I know  I believe the orange  What are they now  Last I looked  They were 3-13  They're struggling  It's been a tough  It's a tough couple months  For New York sports  I can't wait for the Super Bowl  I mean bring that on  Let's go  I'm a Jets  Knicks  Islanders  Guy  Brutal  Nothing's going on  With any one of those teams  Nothing is going on  In New York  I mean New York sports  Steiner sports  I'd say thank God  For the legends  For the Derek Cheaters 
[01:56:00]  The Eli Mannings  The Steiner  Otherwise  Boy I don't know  What I would be doing  I'm thinking about  Maybe going to unemployment  Or filing or something  I really think  The ice scrapers  Is a really smart  Clever idea  Next to the dirt  The dirt's still cranking  You know  We're still  Now up to  Now I just want you to know  I want to give you an update  We haven't been on  I haven't been on  Probably for 6 months  Or maybe 8 months  That long  Wow  But we're up to over  40 million dollars  Of game use dirt now  Approaching 50  That's crazy  And when you see  The whole line  When you come up to the office 
[01:56:30]  You'll see this whole  Now dirt operation  Because we came up  With this whole new line  Of products  That are flying  We're able to customize  The dirt maps  Where you can take  A picture of you  And then you know  You go and travel  To see all the different  Ballparks  So you'll actually  Be able to kind of  Take a picture with you  And then you'll have  All the different ballparks  And as you  Hit these ballparks  You're able to kind of  Check it off  And have a map of that  It's kind of cool  That's been sounding like crazy  Do you cheat with the dirt?  No  Out of bounds  Out of bounds 
[01:57:00]  Dirt  Is what I'm saying  All the dirt  Is authenticated  By MLB  So it's witness  And we can't even  Open up  We can't even  Open up a tub of dirt  Unless the authenticator  Is there  Wow  A tub of dirt  How do they get the dirt again?  It's been a while  I'm trying to remember now  We're at the ballparks  You know  They have authenticators  And the field guys there  And they'll take a bucket  And they'll take it right off  Usually the pitcher's mound  Usually the infield area  But some of the ballparks  Will actually go  And take some off  The warning track too  What's kind of cool  I think I have one of them here 
[01:57:30]  Is all the dirt  From the ballparks  Is a little different  The texture  The color  It just kind of  Makes a cool piece  But how much  One of our best sellers  But how much  You take out  In any given day  Usually a bucket  Goes a pretty long way  A bucket  A bucket usually  Goes a long way  Usually sometimes too  And they obviously  Just replace that  And move on  The margins are unbelievable  Where the hell  Figured that out  Were you the one  That figured out  The dirt thing?  Yeah  That was my creation  I remember it  For the guys selling dirt  Because you remember  When you used to run  On the field  After the championships  You would watch 
[01:58:00]  Everyone just grab  That handful of dirt  And throw it in a beer cup  Or whatever  Now I'm watching  Everybody runs on the field  And seeing what the hell  They're taking  And trying to get security  To stop them  So you can sell that stuff  But you know  We have a pretty good  Pretty very  Actually it's extremely  Well organized  When these championships happen  Like I was thinking  The Auburn-Alabama game  Is that a better game  Than that game?  Amazing  I mean screw Alabama  I'm so happy  That Auburn won  Which that's another story  But where's the ball?  Where is the ball  From the final?  From that game  No one knows 
[01:58:30]  No one knows  Where that ball was  Now Steiner was there  And we had our system in place  We'd at least know  Where the ball was  And all the equipment  Would be authenticated  From the guy who ran back  For the touchdown  You know and stuff like that  I mean it's one of the  Great college games  And that's my whole thing  It's like  You know people  Knock me a little bit  Here and there  For grabbing stuff  And taking stuff out  Of the locker room  With the teams  And that stuff  But at least people know  Where it is now  And it's real  Yeah  People want it  I thought they had that  Down now  Where they just know  Where that ball was  Yeah not a lot  Well some of the teams  But not all of them 
[01:59:00]  And that's my goal  And that's one of my  Visions is to  Get all these teams together  So that we can authenticate  And we can organize  This stuff  So 50 years down the road  We're not arguing  Who has the home run ball  And who has the touchdown ball  And I'm hoping  That's going to come true  Did I ever ask you  We all know the  Honus Wagner card  Is the most valuable card  Right?  Yeah  Did I ever ask you  What the second  Most valuable card is?  Does anyone actually know that?  It's a good question  There's  Obviously there's the  Triple crown card  With Mantle 
[01:59:30]  His rookie card  Very valuable  There's probably about  15 or 20 cards  That  Are sort of in that category  Matter of fact  There's a bunch of  Really cool cards right now  We're doing an auction  On our website  And there's a whole set  Of these cards  This guy Jeff Gittemer  You ever hear of him?  The one  The little red book  Of selling  And he's a real character  But anyway  He's a huge collector  He's got some issues  I mean several million dollars  And finally his wife  Finally said  Either you or the collection go  And he decided  The collection  And he has these  Incredible cards  As far as part of  The collection 
[02:00:00]  I'm a mild card collector  But there's definitely  Cards that are worth  As much as  $10,000, $15,000  On our site right now  That we're auctioning off  Really  Very cool  Great  Like which ones  There's a  There's definitely  A Babe Ruth card  On there  On the site  And there's a couple  Other ones  Some individual cards  Some very cool stuff  You know we're doing  The Deacon Jones collection  Unfortunately Deacon passed  Wait wait wait  You're too much going on here  Okay  I gotta slow you down a little bit  I was thinking on the auction  How much does the Babe Ruth card  Go for?  I don't know  It's on an auction 
[02:00:30]  But how much do you think  It's going to go for?  I guess it's good enough  $10,000, $15,000  That card  There's very rare cards  In this set  Right  And the whole set  Could go for as much  As $100,000  Wow  Be dialing  Be dialing people  I think  Not to push you on  SteinerSports.com  But if you go there  You can take a look  At the set  I think you could sneak  A Babe Ruth card  My way at this point  You think?  Yeah I think so  The fat, drunk,  Numinizing, cancer, kazoo man 
[02:01:00]  Or how about a Babe Ruth ball?  I'll take one of those  We have some nice  Babe Ruth items  How much does a Babe Ruth baseball  Go for?  I think more like  Why don't you take  One of the lockers  From the old stadium  We're trying  No I want a Babe Ruth thing  You want a Babe Ruth thing really?  How much for a baseball?  The baseball is still  Anywhere from  A decent baseball  Seven or eight grand  All the way up to 50  Damn  I mean people will pay  Fifty, sixty thousand dollars  For a baseball  Wow  But you can get a Babe Ruth shit  For a couple thousand dollars  You know like an autograph  That somebody's cut  That may be signed  On a photo  And they just cut it out  They cut it out  Yeah that sells 
[02:01:30]  For anywhere from  Seven or eight hundred dollars  Oh that's how they get  Around the personalized autographs  You just cut the thing out  Exactly  And then mount it nice  Yeah  Mount the dice  Underneath the photo  Right  It's kind of what we're doing  With Kyle Clemens  You know on the Rams  Who used to be on the Jets  Oh I got to quit  You take all the Jet crap  And now you cut the photo  That's not a good story  But did you march into  Kurt Schilling's house  For the open house sale?  Oh I couldn't be happy for Kurt  Really  I couldn't be happier  Really?  Kurt is not one of my favorite people  I remember  You had a bad experience with him 
[02:02:00]  You said  Bad experience  But I'm just  It's nice to see him  Coming down with all the rest of the people  But he was selling his DVDs even  He should be  We did an hour on all the stuff he was selling  It got more and more pathetic  I wouldn't sell it  I wouldn't sell it  I wouldn't sell it  One of his laps  If there's any Schilling fans out there  Please  I mean you can steal Schilling stuff off my site  I'm hoping by the year 2020 to get rid of it all  Wow  Yeah  It's taking a while  Maybe he gets an all-fame  I don't know  Maybe  But yeah  He was just  He was just bad  He didn't treat us well 
[02:02:30]  I'm putting Alabama underneath Kurt  But Alabama was right up there too  And not treating us well  Really?  In that relationship  What did they do?  I don't think they liked  I don't think they were really fine  Well first of all  Anytime you have  An equipment guy  His name is Tank  That's a problem  Yeah  But I mean  Tank had his own little gag  Had his own little thing going on there  And they just didn't get the cooperation  They weren't just on board with me  Although I love Saban  Saban was great  Saban was great to work with  And he was a true pro  And they did all the right things for us 
[02:03:00]  We should do an Opie and Anthony collectible  What do you got?  What do you got in mind?  Anything?  I think it's got to start with the bobblehead  No  We're better than bobbleheads  You've got to start with the simple stuff  Come on  That's what you think of us?  A bobblehead  A bobblehead  But I think you've got to take all your favorite sayings  And put it on a baseball  Probably that would be a good start too  That would be a good start  That would be a good start  Yeah let's think  Pass the bobblehead  Please  Jeez  I don't like a good bobblehead  Bobbleheads are hot  If you're like in baseball or something  Not for radio guys 
[02:03:30]  The bobbles are hot  They're still hot huh?  Yeah they really are  Especially this year at Yankee Stadium  Where they were doing the giveaways  And I mean people were calling me up  Asking me usually  You know for tickets  They're asking me for the bobble  Look at the Sam Roberts bobble  Crazy  There's a Sam Roberts bobble  That's really nice  Wow  That's hot  Yeah  I bet you that's what we saw it after  Very  Quite quite  How many of you saw  No there's only one  Only three were made  Oh no  That's even more limited  Very limited  Probably somebody  You probably auctioned that off  That means it was in high demand 
[02:04:00]  Yeah  How can you tell the difference  Between limited edition  And nobody gave a shit  Well you go to my website  You look under Kurt Schilling  Signed photographs  And you see some of the limited editions  Did nobody care?  Yeah  Not a lot of people care  Wow  And the guy  I mean broke the curse  I mean he did probably some good  For the people up in Boston  But you see  It's weird  We felt bad for him  Because that whole thing  But you're someone who had a real experience  With him and just said he was a fucking jerk  Just really not nice  I didn't quite use the F word 
[02:04:30]  No I used it  But I'm just powerful  But you're right in the territory there  I mean you know  Imagine you have 5,000 items  To get signed  And the Red Sox  One of the best years of Steiner Sports ever  When they won  They broke the curse  After I got over the misery  Of the Yankees losing and everything  I kind of got on the Red Sox bandwagon  So imagine we have these 5,000 items  And you know  You have a truckload of stuff  And we needed to have four players sign it  Kurt being one of them  And he's like  I said Kurt  Well we have to get a hotel  And these other two guys  Can only sign on the same day you're signing 
[02:05:00]  It's okay if these guys come over your house  One of them was Johnny Damon  I forget who the other player was  And he's like  No they can't come over my house  I said you're a teammate  Oh boy  No they can't come over  Did he ever give you a reason why?  No  Oh gosh  And then I saw that attitude  When we were in a hotel  About a year later  We were at the Hyatt  And he wouldn't go in the room  With the other players  It was Ortiz  I forget the pitcher's name  There was three guys in the room  At the Hyatt  We were doing a signing  And Schilling's like  I'm not going to the room 
[02:05:30]  Those guys are signing  I have to have my own room  Oh boy  I'm like you've lost your mind  And I'm like by the way  I'm not one of the signing guys  You know I had to reintroduce myself  You know I'm like  I'm here  And I'm like  I don't come and do these signs that often  So you need to come in this room  And sign this shit now  He actually did  He actually kind of came  You know came down a little bit  And went in the room  With his teammates  To sign this stuff  Yeah wow that's outrageous  This is why I don't have any hair left  On my head  I mean it's insane  You know it's like  You're dealing with this insanity  It's crazy  Do you have any personal stuff  That you collect yourself 
[02:06:00]  Oh all the time  What's like your best thing  You got  I mean it's a couple different things  I mean obviously  I have a lot of stuff  That I've collected  My Thurman Munson autograph  That I got when I was a kid  That's a good one  When I got  You know he came in the elevator  After I was screaming at him  On the field  And I was staying in that hotel  And he came in the elevator  And got in my face  And said what do you want  I was like 14 years old  I was like  I just need your autograph please  So that was a great moment  And then my Mark Messier photo  Of him holding the cup  We wrote  We did it  That's how I started 
[02:06:30]  Steiner Collectibles  Because I just figured  I could sell 15,000 of those  You know  That's the amount of people  That the garden holds  That's how it all started  That's how it all started  Wow  Yeah it was that one photo  And I love Mark  So he's one of my favorite players  Just a great person  So I have that  It's one of my favorites  And then one time  I was doing  You know I would do a show  On Yes Network  Memories of the game  Sure  So I go to Mariano's house  This is early on  Like 99  Don't you dare tell  That god damn  Cardboard glove story again  Well  Did I tell you that right 
[02:07:00]  I told you that story  I'm getting old  I'm getting senior  This will be the third time  That's one of my favorites  To be honest  Last time you were in  And told him  He made believe  We didn't know  I wasn't here when that happened  I would say that glove  It was a cardboard  He was here  It was a cardboard box  It was his first glove  He used as a kid  But the other favorite items  Is I have his cleats  From the last game  I have his cleats  From the last game  Of the Yankee Stadium  He gave me  Which is kind of cool  All the dirt on there 
[02:07:30]  And everything  So that was kind of cool  He used to actually play  He would cut the glove  And play with a cardboard glove  And fucking  Yeah he was pouring stuff  You get that on my website  Get that on  BrandonSteiner.com  You can watch the whole  Mariano story  You want to give some stuff away  Let's do it  Oh man  Let's do it  I brought some really cool stuff  You want to do sports trivia  Or something  We've got to do something  Yeah  Yeah  Can't just give people stuff  Our phones  It's crazy  I guess they love you  Brandon  Because our phones  Keep it  They keep blowing up  Yeah 
[02:08:00]  All the lines are ringing  And then they go dead  Now they're ringing again  Well I'm very grateful  First of all  The fans  I'm 26 years now  And at least I'm thinking  Of stuff that people still want  And I never take that  For granted for a day  So thank you  For everybody out there  That has supported  The product line  Steiner  Because it's  I love it  And I don't want to stop  How's the A-Rod stuff  Been selling since  His big controversy  You would find him  In the category  A little underneath  Kurt Schilling  Oh shit  Really  Actually I love A-Rod  He's such a great collectible guy 
[02:08:30]  Because he was one of those guys  Who would write anything  And loves the sport  So he actually still sells  A little bit here and there  But obviously a big drop for him  I'm hoping that everything  Gets straightened out  Maybe we'll get him back on track  Who's like huge?  Jeter I guess  Would be  I'll tell you  Mariano  Mariano was huge this year  No question  And you know  What we're kind of getting into  Also  I know it's a stupid thing  You know when the guys  Are on the mound  And they can pull Mariano  Out of the game  Him, Jeter, and Pettit  That's like been 
[02:09:00]  The hottest thing  Signed  Unsigned  People just love that moment  It's just a moment  I think  Just the end of his career  Kind of the last thing  That happened for his career  And people just  Just buying that stuff  Out of sight  Wow  And I love that  I love that moment  I love moments  Moments  That's like a great moment  You know  Jeter diving over the wall  Or the catch with Eli  And you know  In the Super Bowl  Right  I love that stuff  It's more than a  Catch  It was more than a catch  It was more than a catch  Whatever happened to that guy  Yeah where is he 
[02:09:30]  He's at the Steiner store  At Roosevelt Field  In a couple months  Signing autographs  Well now we have them  Drawing out the play  Which I love  I can't believe that Eli  Was up in the office  The other day  Drawing out the play  I'm like  I cannot believe  You're drawing out the play  I can't believe  You remember the play  And he's like  He's asked me to do it  So I'll do it  Eli Manning  Is the nicest  That's what I hear  Being on the planet  Yeah  The best  Okay  We got the phones ringing  Give me a number  From one to nine there  To make this totally random

[02:11:30]  What you got  In your hands right there  That's pretty damn cool  This is like  Where we have to go  With you guys though  We got to get  Some of your famous quotes  Oh yeah  I like that idea  We're in  We got the  Don't go home with hope sign  On the door  You may need one of these  You may need one of these  Up in your office  No kidding  Now we're in Coach Knight's  In Lubbock, Texas  I was a little nervous  Frank  The first time I met him  First thing I'd seen  His house  Was he nice?  Unbelievably nice  And what kind of house?  Nice house  Middle of kind of  In Slubbock  I mean 
[02:12:00]  Not much going on there  But  It was just  It was humbling  To be around a guy like that  Because so knowledgeable  And a great guy  Way, way  Took me by surprise  What was in his house  That made you go  Wow  First of all  An insane collector  Really?  Had to have at least  150 guns  Wow  He was a big hunter  Fishing rods  That he fished with presidents  That were 30, 40 years old  Game use, basketball  I don't think the guy  Ever threw out a pair of sneakers  That he coached with  Just  He was a big saver  And what surprised me 
[02:12:30]  The most with him  Is the amount of books  Had to have at least  A thousand books in the house  There wasn't a basketball book  I'd ever heard of  That he had in the house  Which he didn't admit  Reading them all  But I think he did  Right  His knowledge is  Unbelievable  Right  I could talk basketball  With him for days  Did he take any of his sneakers  When he wasn't looking?  Took them all  I took them all  This is very close to my size  Good for you  And you know  It's crazy  He saved every red sweater  Right  Which is crazy  He had probably  200 red sweaters  And then the amount of ties  Were crazy  He was my kind of guy  Because he's a serious collector 
[02:13:00]  Right  Closet collector  But he never admitted it  Yeah  Coach you are a collector  I mean I know  You don't want to admit it  But I love when we're at the garden  About two months prior to that  He's like  Brandon I'm going to give you  Two months to get to my house  Where I'm throwing this shit out  And you either get to my house  Or I'm throwing this out  I don't want to hear it  And he was kidding  What did you get from him?  Well his rings  You know we had auctioned off  His rings  I think there's a few things  On the auction site now  That we're still selling of his  But his rings 
[02:13:30]  And he had some trophies  That he wanted to get rid of  He was moving to another house  So he had the red sweaters  The ties  Wait actual red sweaters  You're selling?  From Bobby Knight?  Yeah  Holy fuck  I mean the guy was notorious  For wearing a red sweater  No I know that  Yeah  I didn't know he actually  Gave you the sweaters  When my time on earth  Is gone  And my activities here  Are past  I want them to bury me  Upside down  Oh no don't say it  So the critics can kiss  My ass  I love that  As soon as I saw him  I'm like we gotta replicate that

[02:19:30]  So anyway this has  All of Mariano's  Accomplishments  It's a really cool poster  What are some of the  Accomplishments on there  You know Moe  Well his 602  When he broke the record  Part of the core four  He's the last one  To wear 42  Five time world champion  42 postseason saves  Mariano Rivera  Mariano Rivera  So ready for that  Yeah let's go to  Bobby in New York  Bobby  Hey what's up  Hey man  Hey Brandon  Brooklyn guy  Can I have one quick question  I have a 39 team ball 
[02:20:00]  From Christy Walsh  That was authenticated  By James Spence  Before he was JSA  Like actually authenticated  By him  I've been trying to trade it  For a cut  Gehrig  Which is  Gehrig's on the ball  Demajer's on the ball  Chris Setti  And you know  Most of the team  Is like 9 or 10 guys  Including Joe McCarthy  On the sweet spot  I can't find a way  To trade it  For a good cut  What does a good cut mean  Well what you do  Is you take an autograph  What we were talking about  Before the chit  You take a cut off  You cut the autograph out 
[02:20:30]  Yeah cut the autograph out  I'm just trying to put  A collection together here  Okay  You short an autograph  Hold on  You cut the index  Well the index card  Would be a cut  So sometimes the autograph  Is on a photo  Sometimes on something  That you really don't want  Or sometimes on an index card  That would be  Or it's personalized  And you're not that guy  So you cut out the autograph  Gotcha  Personalization  But you know  With the old  Old autographs  Sometimes people  Putting collections together  Original people  In the Hall of Fame  Or a particular team  And you're trying to find  These different autographs  eBay really gives you 
[02:21:00]  A good chance to do that  Or these auctions  That we do  Right  And he's trying to put  A collection together  And who are you missing?  Well no  I have the 39 team ball  But it's hard to display a ball  So I wanted a Gary cut  Now on the ball  Is Gary, DiMaggio, Joe McCarthy  Frank Corsetti  Nice ball  All the guys from the team  And it's authenticated  By a reputable guy  I just  I feel like the value  Of the team  Signed balls  Are going down  In relationship  To the cut signatures  Because I think  They're a lot easier  To put together  And you know  Display  Oh so you want to  Get rid of the ball 
[02:21:30]  And just get the actual  Cut autographs  So do you want to sell that ball?  Gotcha  You want to sell that ball?  I would definitely sell that ball  But I would only want to replace it  Because I'm a very, very big Yankee fan  Very big Lou Gehrig guy  You're going to have to call me  In the office at some point  You've got to call me  The next couple of days  Maybe we can work something there  He's such a huge fan  He's trying to get the disease  That's what I would say  Wait Brandon  I don't want to kill  You know your negotiations  I'll give you 100 points  But I just need to know  How much would a ball like that 
[02:22:00]  Go for you  You don't have to say it  They're not as much as I thought  They're not as much as you think  Really?  They're not as much as I thought  I think to the right customer  Again you have to see  The quality of the ball  And the quality of the signatures  But it's probably a $10,000  5 to 10  $5,000, $7,500  Maybe even $10,000  Yeah I think on the low end  The thing is  It's one of those  The Christy Walsh on the blotter  With the  You know like that was  What does that mean?  Well Christy Walsh  Used to give them his gifts  And they were on like this blotter  So they would sit on your desk  And I have it off the blotter 
[02:22:30]  In a shadow box  But it's just not  It's not as good as I want it  Because the Gehrig autograph is smaller  And Joe McCarthy  The coach is on the  The manager on the sweet spot  So I'm really  I was out for the Gehrig autograph  And that's why I got it  But it's still a  But none of their signatures  Are smushed right?  They're all there?  No no  They're all perfect conditions  Is the blotter a good one?  That's a good thing or no?  That it was on the blotter?  It's a story  Is this Bobby the champ?  Yes  Former intern?  Yes  Extraordinaire? 
[02:23:00]  Sure  Yes  And a collectible  And a collector  And a collector  How much  How much would  You be able to sell  Let's say  A birthday card  To George Steinbrenner  Signed by  The 95  Yankees  What do you think?  Nice and framed  I like that  Yeah  The whole team?  The whole team  That's Donnie Baseball's last year  Donnie Baseball  Yeah  Yeah  I bet you that would sell  For a few hundred bucks  Five hundred bucks 
[02:23:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Some kid that's got it  Yeah  You know his autograph  Is through the roof  Also is  Mr. Steinbrenner's  Great autograph  Yeah  People love that  Anyway you want to do  A quick tribute  Oh  I was in on that one  Yeah Bobby  I mean you  So you got a chance  At the subway map thing  You want to tell us  The year that  Well first of all  Tell us the year  That Mariano Rivera  Won the World Series MVP  The World Series MVP  Was  Oh damn 
[02:24:00]  I think it was 99  That's correct  Wow  Look at this guy  All right  Good job on the line Bobby  All these subway pieces  They're a great Christmas  You want his number  So you guys maybe  Could do a thing too  I would love to get  An office number please  All right  So hang on  We'll exchange numbers there  Bobby  Good talking to you  It's been a while  I don't remember  I have no idea  I heard like  He's an intern  I have no idea  I have no idea  What did he do for us  I was just making believe  Because I saw what you wrote  Two big standouts  Number one was 
[02:24:30]  He used Anthony's megaphone  Oh yeah  All right  And Ant threw the megaphone out  And yelled at him  And was very mean to him  Okay  And the other thing was  He created No Homo  For the show  For the show  Rappers created it  But  No we created that  No no  And then rappers took it from us  We all know that  He brought No Homo  We did that in Boston  Stop it  And Jay Moore stripped nude  And wrestled him  Oh  Yeah  Oh gosh  I don't remember this stuff  I have no idea who this  Kenny  Bobby the champ is a cool dude  He just came to Jim Norton's show recently

You got a question for Brandon as well?  Because it seems like a lot of you guys  Have questions as well  No I mean  I'm a huge collector myself  I just actually  Went out last night  And met Martellus Bennett 
[02:28:00]  Signed a helmet  So  What's your  What's your number one item  That you got  In your collection?

No I was personalized  And I kind of keep that one  From my collection  Well we have a  Cub subway sign  Actually it's some game  Used dirt from Wrigley 
[02:28:30]  I'm a big fan of Wrigley  I'm a huge Cub fan  Oh god  What happened there?  Hold on  Let me turn down the phone  His phone got a little excited  I like that  Go ahead Mike  That's how Cub fans get  So what do you got?  Lord knows  They haven't won in a long time  That one has actual dirt  What player said  Let's play two?  Ernie Banks  Correct  Wow  Alright  This is a nice piece  You'll love this subway sign  And listen  I know it's been tough  For you the last  What is it?  80 years?  Oh man  Hopefully maybe next year  Could be your year 
[02:29:00]  Yeah I hope so man  Thank you  Hold on Mikey  I appreciate you calling  A question coming in  Is there a way  To restore a faded signature?  It's difficult  But there's a way  To stop it from getting worse  You know  Every situation  Is a little differently  But what I try to do  Is just because it's fading  Doesn't mean you have to  Completely lose it  So you got to kind of  You know  There's protective glass  And there's certain cases  We sell the cases  On our website  Of Steiner Sports  So we have 
[02:29:30]  Obviously always protecting  What you collect  Is important  And there's also  Some special glass  You can do if it's a photo  You know  Protecting what you collect  One of my biggest things  Is  In doing  I see so many people  Have their collections  Under their bed  In their closets  Because they're afraid  It's going to get faded  Or ruined  And there are really cool  Protective stuff  That you can get  To at least showcase your stuff  And have fun with it  Well Brandon  I got signed  To Boxy Gloves  And Jimmy pretty much  Had a heart attack  When it came over  To my house  Because my  I think he was seven 
[02:30:00]  At the time  Nephew  Had him on  And was punching people  Sugar Ray Leonard  That's not good  Yeah probably not good  For the kids to play with  I didn't even yell  I sent you a case  For those gloves right  No I was trying  To get a case  I had to order them  From somewhere  I wanted the UV protected  Yeah I thought  I'd send you  A boxing glove case  My gloves are in  My closet right now  I'll send you  I have an Ollie glove  I'm trying to get  Our cases are  Probably the second  Best thing I've ever invented  Wait are they on the site  Can I go to the site 
[02:30:30]  Sometimes I can't find them  The boxing glove case  Are beautiful  So not a good idea  To have your  Not a good idea  To have your nephew  Wearing it  And punching people  Not a good idea  When your autograph  Hits you  Unless your nephew  Should be the next  Sugar Ray Leonard  Wait where are they  On the site  Because I think  That would be a big seller  And I try to find them  If you go to the website  And you punch in  Which ones  Do you have signed  The Ollie  The Joe Frazier  Oh yeah those are good  I want those protected  I had to order them  From some other place  I don't want to do that  Yeah don't do that  And they are UV protected  Yeah  Because I put everything

[02:35:30]  You know way 200 and nothing  Right  No talent  Didn't they exaggerate the story for the movie though  Isn't everything a little exaggerated though  A little bit  Give the guy a little slack  He still came through  It was a good movie  Great movie to watch with your kid  Great movie but not believable  It was a little stretch  But anyway  See people know that  A little too much Hollywood in that one  But you know when you watch that movie  You're crying at the end  Of course  You ever see radio  I cried at that one too  Cuba Gooding Jr  Good actor  Go ahead  Thank you  Play like a champion  You know the sign that the Notre Dame team 
[02:36:00]  Touches on the way out  Sure  One of my favorite  Lou Holtz  I like what Penn State touches on the way out  So  Tough year  Tough year for Notre Dame by the way  A fucking  Not as tough as Penn State  Right  Can you imagine  What goes on with Paterno and his collectibles  Bloody underwear  Not good  He didn't sign a lot  He wasn't the most cooperative  When it came to this sort of thing  Right  Yeah  And you know he wasn't 
[02:36:30]  At what  Investigations  He's got to deal with  And now he's erased from history  Like he never even was a coach officially  Is his legacy hurt by this whole thing?  Hurt would be a word  Damalish would be a little bit more accurate  He officially never won a game  Yeah I mean  Wow  Amazing  But you know they don't  Listen  Damalish  His career is demolished  No question  But when you go up there  They don't think anything happened  Oh yeah yeah yeah  I mean it's very strange up there  I mean there's people still  Where the statue was 
[02:37:00]  You know before every game  You know people are crying  You know they're  So it's very twisted  They still love him  Yeah they still love him  I mean he's cherished up there  He's such a  And I'll see  He's a bum  It's really weird how they worship  Like when it came out  That he just didn't do  What he was supposed to do  They fucking  How are people so tied to a game  That that's more important  Than him reporting a pedophile  What the fuck's wrong with people  It seems like you knew  Well you lose your way  Yeah I guess so  You get to the top of the mountain  You start looking down on people  Instead of you know  Being blessed and being happy  Somebody got there 
[02:37:30]  And doing something good with it  Right  And that's kind of what happens  Sometimes in sports  You get a little  People get a little crazy  And radio  I happen  On the flip side  I happen to like this coach  I mean I thought this coach  One of my favorites  Lou Holtz  Who always seems to have done  The right thing  And we love  We love our relationship with him  And I like to play like a champion  Which is a little  Inspiration motivational  Sure  Anybody there in the Midwest  Or  Indiana  Indiana's good  Alright  Let's go to Clay in Indiana  Clay  What's up boys  You got a question for Brandon  Yeah 
[02:38:00]  Is this the Joe Paterno Blanglers  That's pretty funny  I didn't think I was going to like you  I thought I was going to have to  Mold you into something  But you really came through  Alright listen to Brandon  You got  You got a chance at this  Are you a Notre Dame fan  What  Are you a Notre Dame fan  Or what are you a fan of  No I'm a Cub guy  I was hoping for the dirt  But  Oh jeez  Yeah the Cub

[02:39:30]  You can have a field day there  Why can't you get rid of it  Because the Cups suck  But what kind of stuff you got  I have all the jackets  And the jerseys  And bricks from Wrigley Field  And all this stuff  And they just aren't selling  Cup fans are down  You know they raised the prices  Of the tickets  Which kind of pissed off people  Because they always had a sellout  Now they don't  And Cup fans are a little sensitive now  They feel like they're getting  A little bit pulled and pushed  Am I wrong  Is that listener still there  No we got right  Yeah I mean  They hung up on them  Yeah Cup fans are a little touchy

[02:46:30]  A lot of familiar stuff  One for them  One for me  One for them  One for me  Oh man  Two for them  Thirty-seven for me  E-Rock  Have you ever  Grabbed anything  From some of those  Auctions  Never  That's bullshit  We didn't do the last auction  We have piles of stuff  Once again  We'll tell this fucking story  The last day  At the XM studio  We gave all the shit  We had in the office  Away because we never  Did the other auction  Not the good stuff  No we didn't  We gave everything  That we had in those bins  No we didn't  No we didn't 
[02:47:00]  What did you keep  We should do our own auction  Nothing from that  Not to make money  But just give it  To all the listeners  Well we never  All the extra stuff  Ends up in the nagle  Well we should start like  Let's start collecting again  And we'll have one big  Fucking over the top auction  Maybe we'll give money  To charity or something  We'll do that  On Steiner Sports  We'll do the auction for you  And then you gotta figure out  An Opie and Anthony collectible  I'm gonna do it  But that's for like  You know  A little taste  Yeah  We want a little taste  Of that one  A little scratch  A little scratch  A little pocket money  We're gonna do it  We're gonna come up with  I'm gonna come up with  A couple ideas  We're running by you  And how much do you get 
[02:47:30]  I gotta make some money  How much is your taste  I mean usually  We go like 50-50 on it  50-50  I gotta make it  I gotta sell it  I gotta commission guys  To sell it  I gotta ship it  I gotta pack it  But then us three  Have to share the other 50  Well  You'll work it out  That means it's 17-ish  But  For us  17%  But it actually depends  On the item actually though  But you guys want to  Maybe sign something  How about we give you 33%  We're negotiating  Yes  Okay I'm good for that  That means we still 
[02:48:00]  Only get about 22%  Each  That's fair  Let's do it  I think I can come up  With a couple good ideas  You know what  I'm gonna do this whole thing  Myself  Fuck it  I don't need you  Maybe you should get  A little more  I'm going on Shark Tank  Fuck you  I'm gonna come up  With that idea  But by the way  You guys should do  A little auction  We'll do it once a year  Around this time  Yeah  We'll figure some out  Pay some money for one  Of your charities  I got a signed  Ted Williams  It was  Ted  No not the head  It's a signed  Thing  Congratulating the Red Sox  On their World Series victory 
[02:48:30]  How much is that  A photograph  Or  Yeah  It's about 500  600 bucks  Nice  Okay  Nice  Hey have you  Do you really believe  That the Ted Williams  Head exists  Yes  He died before that happened  Yes  I dealt with John  I dealt with John Henry  And I believe that  He was a little crazy  I read the whole thing  Yeah we were  Like his distributor  No I remember the stories  His son was a complete asshole  He made Ted sign  All fucking day long  He didn't want to do that  At the end of his life  But where's the head  And can you see it  I don't know 
[02:49:00]  No  The head's in Arizona  I think  There was  I read something  It was the day they took  Ted Williams' head  And it was a story  About what they did  They got him  They ship him over  In ice  And then they  It's a long operation  They gotta drill holes  In the side of his skull  To relieve any pressure  And then they put sensors  To see if his brain  Was freezing  And then they  Lopped their head off  They cut through  And then they take a bone saw  And saw it through his neck 
[02:49:30]  It was a whole like  Play by play  About him getting his head cut off  This isn't a Seinfeld episode  No swear  Swear  Holy fuck  So we know somebody  That has seen the head  How do we get to see the head  There's a staff there  That then put it  In a cryogenic freezing  No the tank isn't  See through or anything  And you can't take it out  Why can't we take a little peek  I don't think they allow that  There was a photo of it  But that people didn't know  If it was real or not  There's a picture  That was taken of it  As the procedure was happening  No way 
[02:50:00]  I don't know if it's real or not  I'm just telling you  What I've seen  I'd say no  Alright we got Steve  Still waiting  Poor guy  He's dealing with our nonsense  Steve from Staten Island  Welcome to the show  You got Brandon Steiner  He's gonna give you a chance  To win which ball?

Sell hats  I was a writer  I was a football editor  I actually have a helmet  I was gonna ask Brandon about  Really quick that I have  From the trading cards  What kind of helmet?  It's um  Well it's awful  It's from the 2006 NFL draft  It's got a couple of autographs on it  It's got uh  Mario Williams  Vernon Davis  Reggie Bush  But it also has  Vince Young and Matt Liner  Completely diarrheaed the bed  In their NFL careers  But I don't know if it was  What kind of helmet was it?  It's just a plane  It just has the NFL logo on it  Oh NFL logo?  Yeah  It's worth  You know basically  It's always worth a few hundred bucks 
[02:51:00]  You always wipe off  The bad autographs  Off that helmet  That's the good news  And keep the good autographs  And add some other ones to it  You never want to wipe them off  Because you never know  Because you never know  What somebody will do one day  Like you never know  They may save the president  And you'll be like  Oh no  I wiped that off  I wiped that autograph off  I'm not sure  That any of those guys  Are going to be saving  I have a tampon  That Bob Apodaca signed  How much is that worth?  Not a good item  So anyway  Brandon stop playing  Not a good item  I'm not  Fucking with his livelihood  I love this  No but people probably 
[02:51:30]  Come up with all the time  With these fucking idiotic things  That they think  Are worth a lot of money  Tommy John's girlfriend  Sent me an x-ray  Of his surgery  You know  Tommy John's surgery  What kind of surgery?  The x-ray of the  Tommy John surgery  Of course  Oh really?  And you couldn't sell that?  Well that sounds like  Something that would be  I wasn't feeling that  But I would have liked  If Tommy John now signs it  I wanted Derek Jeter's  Cast to his foot  That it would have sold  Wait I think  Hold on  I think Tommy John 
[02:52:00]  Signed the Tommy John x-ray  Right  That's big  Pretty fucking cool  For a lot of people  Out there  Really?  I didn't feel that  Mass produced the x-ray  Get him to sign that shit  Well I could get you one  Did you want to buy one?  Because I could transact  With you right now  I'm just thinking  If you're a big time  Baseball fan  And give you a discount  And now the surgery  Is legendary  To see the x-ray  Of the first one  That's kind of cool  We've got to fix this  We've got to put that there  And then  What should we call  This procedure?  Exactly  He changed the name  I mean  No he didn't  But they did  Let me have to think 
[02:52:30]  That again  Alright  That's good feedback  If you like that idea  I like goofy items  I'm a fan of the goofy items  It's something no one else has  Come back to me  Send that in to me  Please  That's a tampon.  That's a tampon is big.  Ed Cranepool once signed a booger, and I ate it, though.  Couldn't help yourself.  Let's go.  How do you sign a booger?  Who was on the phone again?  I don't know.  Steve's still there.  Steve.  Steve.  All right, we got the ball.  Who was the 1996 World Series MVP? 
[02:53:00]  John Wetland.  Correct, Armando.  And one of Mariano's mentors, that's why I bring it up.  Jesus.  You won the Mariano ball.  Good for you, Steve.  Even though you can't find this on my website.  I'm kidding, by the way.  I assume you're a relatively intelligent, functional person.  Probably know how to find it.  We came up with a new case.  We did these cases that actually have the photo in the case and game used dirt.  It's the case that gave me.  And game used dirt.  Let me see the game used dirt.  Cool.  Wow, you got a lot of things here.  I got to remember what's kind of cool is the dirt is on the bottom of the case, and then you have the photo in the back. 
[02:53:30]  Pretty cool, right?  Where's the dirt?  I don't see the dirt.  I have it covered.  E-Rock.  Wouldn't you love that?  Yeah, just laying around.  E-Rock's crying.  By the way, E-Rock.  You don't have to show me.  It's okay, buddy.  I have one.  Of course.  I have one of those in my house.  It was sent by Steiner Sports.  It's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool.  You take the packaging off, and the little round circle that the ball sits on, sits on a little bit of dirt.  It looks great.  I got my Rivera ball on that.  This is cool.  It's like a new product line we just came out with. 
[02:54:00]  I figured, let me take the photos we do, the dirt and the ball.  You never can read the autograph sometimes on the ball, except with Mariano, you can.  Speaking of dirt.  Hold on.  Let me get rid of Steve.  I'm not going to hang up on you.  Don't screw this up.  I hope the Arizona guy does call back, because I feel horrible.  Steve, hold on the line.  Line two is Steve.  It's a nice signature.  He does have a great signature.  Mickey Mantle has a beautiful signature.  Always took it seriously.  Yeah, look at that.  Rivera's is so legible and nice.  His liver.  When we did signs with Mickey, back when I first started Steiner, he would actually come up to me when you mess up an autograph and be upset and want to re-sign it. 
[02:54:30]  He always wanted things to be perfect.  Really?  Took a lot of pride in his autographs.  It's the way Mariano does, too.  I've got to ask you a business question.  You've got this shit figured out, right?  Why don't you go into other fields, like rock memorabilia?  Trying on the rock and roll.  The rock and roll has been tough for me.  You can't get some of these guys to come and sign some shit?  We have a couple, but we need Bruce Springsteen.  We need Elton John.  We need the biggies.  We need the biggies to get it kind of kicked off. 
[02:55:00]  Okay, I got you.  But close.  Sylvester Stallone just signed their autograph deal.  With you?  No, with another company.  But you've got the business model, so I'm surprised some of these guys aren't coming to you.  Every now and then we're able to kind of break through and do some different things.  But the rock guys really want to do some of the bands.  Movie stars, any of that shit.  So we're getting there.  Godfather.  Imagine some Godfather memorabilia.  Like Pacino's been signing.  Right.  Pacino's been signing.  For you?  Not for me, but for somebody. 
[02:55:30]  And I'm able to get some stuff from him.  Pacino, guys, the problem is you're reputable.  And that's why you should.  Because so many guys, I never buy that shit because you don't know.  You just don't know for sure.  I don't care about their certificates or any of that stuff.  Like, you get everybody so you're believable.  I think it's about the authentication always is number one and then putting the right collection together so that it really extends, you know, the image and who this person is and what the career was all about.  And you take pictures of the guy signing and all that crap.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Absolutely. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  I think we have time for one more if we've got something really cool over there.  We can do two.  If you want to.  Well, we've got these coasters, these Derek Jeter coasters.  Oh.  You always think you put a martini, a dirty martini, you put it on the coaster, you've got a dirty martini.  It's kind of a cute thing.  They're actually drink coasters with game-used dirt from Yankee Stadium on there commemorating Derek Jeter's 3,000 hit.  We can do a quick trivia for that.  Yeah, sure.  Who was the 1978 World Series MVP? 
[02:56:30]  Wait, we'll go to the Bronx.  No, I just want anybody in this room to answer.  That's a good one.  Uh-huh.  19-what?  1978.  1978 MVP World Series.  Chris Chambliss.  Nope.  76 was his big home run.  Wasn't Reggie?  Was not Reggie!  He was a heartthrob.  Oh, Bucky Dent?  Uh-oh.  Oh, is that your heartthrob?  Yes.  Everyone loved Bucky Dent.  A man by the name of Brian Doyle. 
[02:57:00]  Of course, I knew that.  Murray?  Paul DeBronx.  Huh?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Love the show.  Of course you do.  You have ears.  We all know that.  We're gifted.  You know, we're going to give away something.  You don't have to suck up here.  We're going to give you something anyway.  Don't worry.  I got an idea for a good O&A giveaway.  Yeah.  Window clings or sign wow stickers.  We do the wow stickers.  You could mail it.  What do we used to do?  A self-addressed stamped envelope, and we'll do that. 
[02:57:30]  You have to be a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Are you a baseball fan?  Baseball fan, by chance?  Hockey fan.  Hockey fan?  Okay.  Islander, yeah.  Who is the goaltender, who is the backup goaltender for the 94th Stanley Cup Ranger  team?  Oh.  Van Biesbrook.  Wow, guys.  Definitely not.  We're hanging up on you.  Oh, my God.  Jeff, if you're wrong, you'll be a hockey fan. 
[02:58:00]  Edgar Mellencamp.  Oh, my God.  Just hung up on him.  All right.  Let's go to, you know what?  It was Glenn Healy, by the way.  Mike Richter making the big save on Brewery, and it's nothing like that.  Can I send stuff to Canada?  Have we figured that shit out between the two countries?  Okay.  Let's go to Joe in Canada.  Joe.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Welcome aboard.  Joe, a baseball fan?  I like more of a hockey fan myself, too, up here in Canada.  More of a hockey fan?  Yeah, what are you doing?  You hosing down a fucking...  What are you hosing?  I can't think of anything to hose down. 
[02:58:30]  I'm not hosing down.  I bombed.  Where in Canada are you from, though?  Ontario.  Ontario?  Sure.  Oh, man.  It's cold up there?  That's not bad today.  What number was Mark Messier when he played for Vancouver Canucks?  22.  Oh, you clod.  That was Emmitt Smith on the Cowboys.  Oh, God.  You're a fool.  Keep hosing down whatever you're hosing. 
[02:59:00]  Hopefully it's a toaster.  You not only let yourself down, but you let your country down with that answer.  Oh, wow.  It's Mark Messier.  You could have asked me a Leaf question.  Leaf question, you said?  Yeah, Toronto Leafs.  Oh, all right.  I'll ask you a Derek Jeter question.  Okay.  Ready for this?  Yep.  What number does Derek Jeter wear?  It's also what you are.  Zero?  No.  Number two. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, shit.  We're going to have to give these gifts away to charity.  Sorry about it.  Wow, man.  Canada just doesn't know sports.  Do you have a curling question for this guy?  Yeah.  You need a curling question.  What do we do with Joe?  Say goodbye to him.  He was really...  Joe failed twice in a row.  Oh, no disrespect, Joe.  Oh, Joe.  I'm sorry.  But Brandon has good items here.  We should give them to people who know the trivia.  Jimmy's in control.  I'm sorry. 
[03:00:00]  I would give you something.  We love this show up here in Canada.  No one gives a shit.  Of course you do.  I can't believe that you get the Austin Jackson question right.  It's Detroit.  I mean, it's...  Where's the...  All right.  Where are we going?  How do you not know who Austin Jackson is?  From St. Louis, baby.  Brandon, I'm now going to give you cities and states, and you tell me where you want to go.  We got Chicago.  We got Atlanta.  Let's go to Chicago.  Really?  Yeah.  Didn't we do Chicago already?  Let's do another one.  I have a great Chicago item.  All right, Andy, go ahead.  Oh, great.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, my buddy.  How are you doing? 
[03:00:30]  Who is the manager who is a former Yankee, left fielder, who's the manager of the Cubs?  Former manager of the Cubs over the Yankee.  Played left field for the Yankees.  How do you not know this?  Oh, shit.  Who's the manager in the last three or four years?  Oh.  Not Dusty Baker.  No.  Y'all. 
[03:01:00]  That's fine.  Oh, my God.  No, it's not.  Wow.  Wow.  Exactly.  I'm going to yell at you.  It's going to sound like I'm booing.  Shit.  Can I have one more?  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Should we give you one more?  Sure.  Why not?  Um.  Oh, boy.  Name.  What number was Walter Payton?  34. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  There you go.  I got a baseball signed by the former manager of the Cubs, but really a great guy.  Former manager of the Seattle.  Lou Piniella.  Lou Piniella.  Great.  Sweet Lou Piniella.  That's a cool little function.  Was he number 14 or am I remembering that role?  You're remembering that right.  I love those players.  No, that would be the kind of player I would have been, actually, if I was actually capable  of playing baseball.  All right, Andy.  What?  Big up top, thin legs?  Hold on a line.  Fiery.  Fiery.  Fiery.  Fiery.  Fiery.  We have one more from New York? 
[03:02:00]  Well, I mean.  Someone on the phone.  E-Rock?  But we got Atlanta, Iowa, Houston, Oklahoma, Virginia, North Carolina.  I've been everywhere.  I know you got a lot of New York stuff, but.  I have other stuff.  We can go Rets, Boston?  We did Boston.  We did Boston.  I got Jersey, too.  You know what we'll do is let's just give away a couple gift cards, then.  I'll give away a gift card to anybody you want.  Oh.  The extra?  Yeah, you got any extra just laying around?  Any garbage?  Would you be okay with a gift card, E-Rock? 
[03:02:30]  Sure.  He just wants goodies.  Let's try.  Treats.  Treat, boy.  Let's try Virginia there, Brandon.  This is good.  We got D in Virginia.  All right, D.  I'm giving you a.  If not D, it's G.  Oh, whatever.  Stop.  You're acting like a real C.  Anyone's going to care after we hang up with you.  Sorry about that.  Just try to win this shit.  Who won the World Series MVP this year in this past World Series? 
[03:03:00]  Shoeless Joe Jackson.  I have no clue.  Oh, man.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I called in because I have amazing gloves that's signed by a bunch of boxers, and I want to know how much it's worth.  You can see it on cam.  How much are they?  Yeah, who's signed?  I have a buck glove signed by a bunch of boxers, too.  I got like LaMotta, Floyd Mayweather, a whole bunch of really good ones.  I love those.  People buy those all the time.  It's amazing how many people have things out there that want to know what it's worth. 
[03:03:30]  Again, I'll promote the sign on Facebook.  If you Facebook me with those questions, I'll be more than glad to.  You've got to take a picture of the item.  You Facebook me with the item, and I'll always tell you what it's worth.  For all those of you out there that can't get through.  And by the way, if you want to sell your stuff, I'm more than glad to buy it.  In many cases, I have to get it authenticated by an independent authenticated, but we're always looking for cool, unusual items.  Anyway, it was Big Poppy who was the World Series MVP for this last year.  Oh, man.  How did you not know that?  Wait, who was on the glove that you have, miss? 
[03:04:00]  I see Floyd Patterson.  Wow.  I'm right now.  Okay, I can't see, miss.  Who else?  From 1989?  Floyd Patterson.  Who else?  Who else is on that?  I can't really make out the signature.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's Jake LaMotta.  Good.  To Robert.  That's good.  So if someone named Bob wants a glove signed by Floyd Patterson and Jake LaMotta.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Madam, you're holding it upside down.  Turn it the other way around.  And you're shaking. 
[03:04:30]  And stop touching the signature.  I know.  Easy, Hepburn.  Hold on.  Miss.  You know who was Floyd Patterson's trainer?  God, you're moving it around like you're fucking boxing with it.  Customers.  Ray Mancini?  Ray Mancini?  No?  No?  Ray.  Is that Ray Mancini?  No.  No.  Ray Mancini?  Miss, you keep moving it.  You're doing a hard one.  Oh my God.  Push it back and stop touching the hand.  And she's got her fingers all over the signatures.  Why don't you put butter on them?  We got the Jake LaMotta one. 
[03:05:00]  What the fuck are you doing?  Just grab it by the tippy top.  Gee, hold on.  We'll give you a certificate for Steiner Sports.  Exactly.  Let me get some whisk so you can clean that glove off.  $100 for her, right?  $100 gift card for her, yeah.  Exactly.  So you can buy fucking something to put that in.  I really want a boxing glove, a UV-protected boxing glove.  I'll pay for it.  I don't want it for free.  We're going to send it to you.  It's right on the website.  No problem.  Go to the website, Sam.  I really thought I sent it to you already.  I'm sure the mail.  No, they sent me some stuff, but they never sent me that. 
[03:05:30]  You got one last one, Brandon, or are we good?  We got one last one.  Yeah.  Okay.  Houston, Oklahoma, Iowa, Atlanta.  Where do you want to go?  Anywhere you want.  What is that?  Let's go to Iowa, fuck it.  Let's say hi to Justin.  Justin in Iowa.  Hello.  Justin.  How you doing?  To win a pair of coaster sets with Derek Jeter with Game Use Dirt from Yankee Stadium.  You also got my book, You Gotta Have Balls, which you got to read that book.  It's an inspirational book, my last book I came out with. 
[03:06:00]  What number is Derek Jeter?  Two.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wait, hold on, sir.  Here's an extra trivia question, which you will win nothing for.  Who is number one, three, and four?  Um, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Mickey Mantle.  No.  Everyone knows Mickey Mantle was number seven. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  You could have even gone six on Mickey, but number one is Billy Martin.  Billy Martin, buddy.  And I think...  We're still going to let you win the book and the coasters now.  Number four, was number four Lou Gehrig?  Hold on a line.  Number four was Lou Gehrig.  And number five was Yogi?  No, and number eight was Yogi.  Wait, hold on.  Number five was a catcher, I think.  Was that Bill Dickey?  I don't remember.  Who's number five?  Thurman Munson?  No, he was number 15.  Who was number one?  Oh, right.  I knew it was five.  No, Munson's 15. 
[03:07:00]  Sorry.  Jesus.  What do you say?  We don't like when you mix up Munson's 15.  We get sensitive about the Yankee shit.  Who was number five?  But who else?  Who are we missing?  Which classic?  I don't know.  We know Torrey's number six.  DiMaggio.  DiMaggio.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Joel and Joe DiMaggio.  Joe's yelling at me right now.  Number five for those knuckles.  I want to thank the good Lord for making me a Yankee.  How much is a DiMaggio ball worth you?  Just a regular sign baseball by Joe DiMaggio.  I'm about $750,000 a day. 
[03:07:30]  I would have thought higher.  How about a Reggie Mantle Balls that were up to $2,000 to $3,000 now.  And even up, depending if you wrote one of those cool inscriptions.  Okay.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Good item.  All right.  Why don't we thank Brandon?  This was great.  Really great stuff.  We love when you come in.  Thank you for having me.  Thanks to all the fans out there.  I appreciate it.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  We'll have you back in the spring.  And I'll come back with a true opening Anthony collectible.  There's no question.  Yeah.  We can work out the percentages. 
[03:08:00]  Okay.  All right.  I'll have my people call your people.  We'll get that worked out.  Unless you're throwing a Babe Ruth in.  I just want to know on the air.  Then I'll look the other way.  I want living proof.  Are you guys coming up to the Steiner offices?  I would love to.  The Rochelle, huh?  The Rochelle.  It's 50,000 square feet.  You need like two hours.  Man, how far is it?  Where are your signers?  Are they on Long Island or no?  Because I look at your website all the time.  The Steiner stores the Roosevelt Field in Long Island.  Yeah, that's right.  Go to the website if you really want to see what you want before you come to the business.  It's going to take you two hours to go through the warehouse and really see what you want. 
[03:08:30]  Can we go there when there's somebody signing that's cool?  Yeah.  Okay.  This Saturday we have Mariano over there.  Do you want to come Saturday when you're a kid?  Wait, do you have an area?  Yeah.  You have a cool area up there as well?  We have a whole room where we have like 100 people.  We'll do a Q&A.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  This week we're doing the core four with Jeter, Mariano, Pettit, Posada.  Wow.  We should go up there for one of those.  I would love it.  We get to check out the warehouse and all that.  I want a Pettit ball.  I have Rivera.  I have Jeter.  I don't have Paul O'Neill.  Pettit will be up there next Wednesday.  He's coming up Wednesday. 
[03:09:00]  We have to show you.  You can come up.  We'll probably be up.  Guys from the 98 team or like the 870 team.  You can go right after the show.  That's easy.  Half hour ride.  Can we jump on a train?  Yes.  One walk from the train.  Keep your fingers crossed and get on the Metro North.  And make sure your life insurance policy is all covered.  Yeah, let's do that.  That'd be fun.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Brandon Steiner.  It's been a pleasure.  It's always fun being with you guys.  Thank you.  What's the big plug?  The website is?  SteinerSports.com.  Okay.  Also, if you go to Brandon Steiner and go to my What Else blog, the first 25 people,  I'm going to send you a Mariano Rivera gift card. 
[03:09:30]  All you have to do is register for the blog.  Go to BrandonSteiner.com.  Register.  I'm giving you a gift card for the first 25 people.  Just go in there and register.  That's all you've got to do.  My What Else blog that I do.  It's a great blog.  Great blog.  Good pods.  All right.  Thanks for having me, man.  I love it.  Thank you.  My advice show is today after we're done here.  Oh, fun.  We're sticking around.  I think we'll probably do a couple more minutes of radio after the break.  Brandon, thank you.  Brandon Steiner.  Thanks, sir.  That was good.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor. 
[03:10:00]  And you're a chance to speak directly with him.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Oh, yeah.  Mmm.  Sorry.  The sound you hear is me swallowing a couple of almonds. 
[03:10:30]  Welcome to the Jim Norton extravaganza.  I'm picking my teeth.  There's nothing worse than getting almond in your teeth.  Comer shit, probably worse.  But as far as little snacks that I have in studio, almonds, the only option, trying to  eat better.  So call in.  EROC, what's the number?  866-969-1969.  Okay.  How annoying would it be if I just repeated that?  It's like their ears didn't work when you said it.  All right.  Let's start with Brandon in California. 
[03:11:00]  Not the Brandon we just had here who's addicted to smoking and can't quit.  Hi, Brandon.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you doing?  Good.  How are you?  I've got a real problem with smoking.  I quit.  And then I found myself started smoking again and hiding it from friends and family because  I'm so ashamed of it.  I'm treating it like a meth addict.  And, you know, I'm hiding cigarettes around the house.  Yeah, sure.  I take showers before I can see my girlfriend.  It's getting to a point where I just feel horrible about what I'm doing. 
[03:11:30]  I know I need to quit.  I don't know what to do.  How long have you smoked?  Since 18.  How many years is that?  I don't know how old you are.  Oh, sorry.  I'm 33.  I can do the math.  I don't know.  15 years.  Okay, listen.  I smoked for 17 years.  Quitting smoking is, A, the best.  I quit in 2001.  It's the best thing I ever did or, you know, besides not drinking.  And it's hard.  But it's not as hard as you think.  The scary part, the boogeyman doesn't exist. 
[03:12:00]  Because, again, we think that smoking is a part of who we are.  Like, you feel like you're giving up a part of yourself.  It was a very, very, that's how it is with an addiction.  It's a really insidious way of thinking where the addiction convinces you that it's a big part of your makeup and your personality.  Oh, God, how will I do this?  Because what happens is I tied all this shit into smoking.  I couldn't picture being on my keyboard on my computer without a cigarette.  I couldn't picture enjoying coffee without a cigarette because it had become so ingrained in me. 
[03:12:30]  But when I finally quit, and I've told this story before, I used the patch.  I did it the way that they suggest to do it.  My way is always to do it half-assed, to cut it in half.  I'll do it this way.  I did it exactly as they suggested.  I drank a lot of water with it.  And it helped, dude.  It really helped.  You can quit if you want to.  Yeah.  It's not a part of who you are. 
[03:13:00]  I've quit like 10 times, and I always seem to come right back to it.  I got the pill, the patch, the gum.  What's the longest you've quit?  Every time.  It's successful for, you know, months.  And then I fall off the wagon.  I find a new way to get a cigarette.  I sit right back on it, and I'm back to the back of the egg.  Of course, because that's the way an addiction works.  And it's like the way it works is like they say when it comes to booze.  They say it's not the 10th drink that gets you drunk.  It's the first one.  Because you can't have the second until you have the first. 
[03:13:30]  So all you have to avoid is the first cigarette.  You don't have to avoid the second pack.  You don't have to avoid 10 cigarettes in.  Just avoid the first one.  And the urge, and again, Colin Quinn told me,  it's the only good thing he said to me in fucking 18 years of knowing him,  but he said the urge to smoke will quit.  I'm sorry.  The urge to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not.  And I never forgot that the urge to smoke will pass either way. 
[03:14:00]  So if you give into it, the urge goes.  If you don't give into it, the urge also goes.  So you just have to suffer through that, that jonesing period and realize that your mind is  telling you a lie.  Your body is telling you a fucking lie.  You don't need it.  But it's not doing anything for you.  And eventually, that obsession goes away.  I would never have stayed quit if that obsession was here, dude.  And yeah, you only gave it a few months. 
[03:14:30]  And then, you know, it gets kind of tough and you got to stick through it.  You got to stick through it.  Just avoid the first one, okay?  You can quit.  Thank you very much, Jim.  Okay, buddy.  Take care.  Thank you.  You know, you can't scare somebody into recovery or getting sober.  But go Google pictures of jaw cancer.  Go look at Roger Ebert before he died.  I don't even know if he smoked.  But look at what it looks like when they remove your tongue because there's cancer on it.  Or they take out a fucking, your throat and you're drooling into a fucking bag. 
[03:15:00]  That's what scared me.  It wasn't dying.  Because death is an intangible thing for people.  Well, we know it's going to happen.  But when you see somebody with half their fucking face missing, that is a very, very real thing.  All right.  Before we do that, Eric, let's just go to a call.  And then we can switch that.  We have this stupid error message blocking the cunt screen.  How about, well, since I can't see anything, how about this?  I have a fetish question.  Dan in New Jersey.  Hello, Dan. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, Jim.  How's it going?  I'm good, buddy.  How are you?  Good.  Uh, so sometimes on the show, I hear you talking about how you would get off to like, you know, seeing the girl that you're with, get off to like, you know, thinking about being with another guy.  Yes.  So, so my, my main thing is with my girlfriend is I like to put on like a blowjob scene, like on the side of the bed.  And I like, I will, I honestly won't even watch it.  I'll just watch her watch it.  Right.  And like, see her get off to, and that's what really gets me off. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you mean pornography.  You'll put a porno on blowjob scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's something really, I don't know what you'd call that.  I think sometimes what will turn me on because I've gotten turned on by things when a woman likes them that wouldn't normally turn me on.  Like, and I think sometimes a woman's dirtiness can turn me.  Like I, I knew one woman, that's what it is for me.  I've told this story before too. 
[03:16:30]  I knew a woman who got turned on by incest because she had had sexual relations with her father.  Now, this is again, before I knew her and I met her later in life and I don't know if it was traumatic for her or not, but she would love to talk about that while she was going down on you.  And she would call you daddy and all this.  Now, normally daddy stuff doesn't do anything for me.  But because for her, it was such a weird turn on, or maybe it was just reliving trauma, which I kind of feel bad about, but I got very turned on by it because it was so inappropriate and dirty for her to like it. 
[03:17:00]  You know what I mean?  So I relate to that, man.  It's almost like with a hooker, I would never have wanted like a hooker to go, Oh, you're a whore because she is.  So what would turn me on with a hooker is if there was love involved or if we talked about loving, caring things.  So I sometimes the opposite is the turn on.  Is your girlfriend a good girl in real life?  Oh, she's great.  That's what my main problem is.  She recently, because we've been dating for a while now, I only recently started bringing this into the mix of our love life. 
[03:17:30]  So she's like now coming and telling me that she feels very uncomfortable when you do stuff like this because she honestly only wants to think about me.  You know, and I just feel, I feel so bad because I feel like I'm just indulging in this like terrible, like creature comfort part of myself that I don't really, I'm not really happy or proud about.  It's kind of like I'm a little bit ashamed of it.  Don't be ashamed of it, dude.  But here's the thing.  Women can do that.  I just want to look at you and think of you because again, I, maybe they're as fantasy based as we are. 
[03:18:00]  But for me, I very rarely can only think of my partner all the time.  Um, maybe she's afraid that she'll get distracted and then never think of you.  I don't know.  But I've had that too where girls like, I just want to think of you.  And I'm like, that's great sometimes, but like anything else, it gets to be a little old.  And especially in the world we live in now where pornography and visual images are such an easy and accessible thing. 
[03:18:30]  It's hard to not to want to incorporate them a little bit, you know?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Just keep enjoying it.  Keep eating her pussy while she watches that stuff.  You're a good egg.  Okay.  Thanks, Jim.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  You too, man.  Okay, you rock.  This thing is, well, these computers are dog shit.  We've been asking for fucking years for the phones to be fixed, for the computers to be fixed, and they just do nothing.  Let's get to one more call first.  Craig, Craig in Arizona.  I don't know what you're going to ask about, Craig.  It's a mystery.  What do you want?  Yeah.  He has a question about food addiction and what to do about it.  Oh, Craig Schickle. 
[03:19:00]  Hi, Craig.  Welcome.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, Jim.  How are you doing?  I actually talked to people about eight or nine months ago about a food addiction.  Okay.  I haven't had moderate success going to a certain program and that kind of stuff, but the thing I'm discovering, and I probably have already known this, is I'm also very likely.  I'm definitely a food addict, absolutely, and I'm also very likely, like, an exercise addict.  Sure.  And it's probably the reason I weigh 230 instead of, like, 300 pounds, which is fine, but I noticed that, like, you know, the same sort of compulsive behavior definitely affects, you know, my exercise. 
[03:19:30]  I'm a real shithead to my family and stuff, but I don't get to go for my daily run and that, you know, that kind of thing.  So, you know, as an addict, do I need to work on, you know, all of my additions or is the, you know, exercise addition, should I look at that as, like, a healthy addition and just kind of go with it, or, you know, do they kind of play out with each other, basically?  That's a great question, and it's a tricky one because I'm exactly the same as you, where I get hooked on anything that feels something. 
[03:20:00]  It doesn't always even have to feel good, it can feel painful, and I can get hooked on it, and maybe some would say the dopamine drip is the same for cocaine as it is for chocolate cake, as it is for the runner's high, as my father would call it because he used to run marathons.  I think that you have to do addictions in order of how fast they're going to get you into a pine box.  You know, you can't do everything at once, you're going to be overwhelmed.  Food addiction, you know, as much as I've gotten angry at fat people suing the airlines, I really, I have a tremendous amount of empathy for people with food addictions 
[03:20:30]  because it's so fucking hard, and sometimes the exercise addiction is just a way to enable us to continue eating badly.  You know what I mean?  Like, sometimes we convince ourselves that it's okay, because I'll go do some push-ups now, and then I can still eat the cake.  So we're using one addiction to enable us to continue in the other addiction.  Sure, sure.  But, you know, to change the addiction, dude, that's just a symptom of what's wrong.  It's the underneath that we have to fix.  So whatever the personality stuff is that's making you do this stuff, that's the stuff, the character defects and stuff that you have to deal with or I have to deal with. 
[03:21:00]  So I wouldn't worry as much about the exercise, as long as you're not sacrificing work to exercise or doing things that are really damaging to your life.  Sometimes if we're offsetting something bad, having a healthy outlet is okay, even if we're compulsive with it.  You know what I mean?  I've found, like, don't get crazy, and you know what I mean?  I can only exercise for one hour.  You know, if you're doing six hours of exercises, then you're fucking something wrong with you.  Okay, okay.  But I would just continue to work on the food addiction. 
[03:21:30]  Continue to go to that.  That's the one you should be working on.  The other stuff, deal with in time if it becomes a problem.  But I think the food is the main one.  And make sure you get into the, you know, if there's any steps involved in your program, maybe get into those and delve into those, okay?  Okay.  All right, Jimmy.  You rock, man.  I really, this show's great, and you do a great service for all of us out here, man.  I really appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I know some of this shit and some of it I don't know, but good luck, my friend, all right?  Okay, thanks, man.  Okay, let's see.  Anonymous in New York.  He's 90 days sober. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, thanks to my advice.  Well, it's not thanks to my advice, but I'm happy.  Hello.  Jim, Mr. Darden.  Thank you.  What's your first and last name?  Quick.  No, I'm just kidding.  First off, I love the show.  It's awesome.  I hope it expands and goes to five days a week, whether it's on this channel or another channel.  Thank you.  But I'll make it brief, because I know you've got a lot of callers.  I just want to thank you.  I called a few months ago in a very dark place, and I started going to meetings, and I know you don't like to always talk about, you know, what's groups or whatever. 
[03:22:30]  Right, yes.  Let's just say I started taking suggestions.  Okay.  I got my sponsor.  I got commitment.  I go to a meeting a day, sometimes two, if I can do it.  Great.  And I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do.  My sponsor tells me, just keep doing the work, and I'm going to see the results.  And God willing, if I don't take my will back, and I let God's will work, later this month I'll be celebrating 90 days.  Great.  And it's just, you know, I know a lot of people call in with all kinds of addictions, as I did with you, and I tell you, if you work it, it works. 
[03:23:00]  And I just want to thank you so much.  I love you.  I know you don't know me, but I love you.  I really do.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you for such an inspiration.  And I wanted to ask you also one other thing.  Levity Live.  Would I give you away any of my location, where I'm calling you from?  Sure.  Since I'm anonymous.  But any chance of you performing at Levity Live over at Rush Night?  I hear it's a good club.  I've never done it.  But yeah, sure, there's a chance. 
[03:23:30]  I mean, if they come with the cash.  Yeah, no, I've actually never booked that gig, but it is a good gig.  So I will do it eventually, sure.  And thank you.  You know what?  Well, next time I'm over there, I'm going to mention and say, you know, listen, any way of getting this comedian signed up,  because you're a funny, funny man, and you're an inspiration.  And I'll let you move on to another call.  But thank you so much, and God bless you.  All right, thanks, buddy, and good luck.  90 days is a tremendous milestone.  I mean, you know, the day after it, they say, is just day 91.  And the reason they say that is because we look at it, or a year, or two years, 
[03:24:00]  these incremental little milestones we hit of being sober are big deals.  I mean, for a guy who's an alcoholic, a drunk, and anybody out there, picture the worst one you know,  or the one who's a motherfucker that won't stop.  90 days without it is tremendously important.  It's a tremendous accomplishment, and you should feel great about it.  And then you realize, okay, this is just day 91, and then you move forward.  And then all of a sudden it becomes a year, and then it becomes two years.  And then all of a sudden this is your life, and you realize all these great things you get. 
[03:24:30]  But, you know, we don't always look at life cumulatively.  Like, I forget.  Like, I look at my life, I'm 26 years sober or whatever, and I've done a lot of things wrong.  Sex addiction has hampered my sobriety.  I've done a lot of shitty, unspiritual things.  But all that is said and done, I have a comedy career and a radio career, and I'm alive, and I'm fairly healthy, and I have an apartment.  All of the stuff I have is because I'm sober.  I would have none of it without being sober. 
[03:25:00]  Some guys can accomplish shit without it.  Good for you.  I cannot do it.  So, to the guy with 90 days, man, everything they tell you is true, because it was for me, and I thought they were all full of shit.  So, all right, let's talk to Trenton, North Carolina.  How do you ask your old lady to start doing Kegels?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Is this Ozzy?  Because, you know, she had the vagina titan.  All right.  Hello. 
[03:25:30]  You know, we've had two kids, and, you know, it wasn't too bad there for a while, but I guess, I don't know, it's just over time.  Yeah.  It's not like it used to be, though.  How do I approach that, match that question?  I don't know, man.  Again, I'm not married, and I've never had a girl who I've been in that position with.  But maybe you could just talk to her, I mean, and say, do you feel as good during sex as we used to?  And she might go, yeah, I feel just as good. 
[03:26:00]  Maybe you might want to just mention it to her, just be honest, but be gentle until you still love sex with her.  Like, don't go down on her and then put your fingers and then flop them back and forth, like, what the fuck happened?  You know, I would say, have you ever considered, or maybe when you're fucking her, stuff some old newspaper in there and go,  Oh, this feels better, finally.  Or, you know, call her old shoebox pussy.  Anything you're going to ask that's sensitive like that, I think you have to mention it because this way you don't build up resentment and lose sexual interest. 
[03:26:30]  But just be gentle about it and realize that her feelings might get a little bit hurt, but let her know that you still find her really, really sexy.  That's what I would suggest.  Yeah, because it's been going on for a while, and I have started to find myself losing interest a little bit.  Yeah, better to talk to her and go through an awkward moment, that's all.  Yeah, all right, thanks a lot, Jimmy.  All right, good luck, buddy.  Rob in Texas says, a friend needs some money and you want to lend it to him, but you're afraid it might change your relationship.  Good point.  Hi, Rob.  Hey, Jim, what's happening? 
[03:27:00]  Hi, buddy.  How much money?  Pushing five grand.  I'm probably my wife bought it.  I'm not quite sure yet.  Maybe not quite that much.  I've known this guy for, gosh, 20, 26 years or so.  He's bought my best friend I have, but he has struggled with his business, and he's tried.  He's never asked anybody for anything, and I'm sure to put this on his doorstep, which is going to be a struggle for me to do this, too, now, but I don't want to change the relationship. 
[03:27:30]  Sure.  You know, you see what I'm saying?  I do.  I definitely do.  Now, let me ask you, is the $5,000 something you have to lose, or do you not have it to lose?  Oh, I mean, yes and no.  You know, I mean.  How much would you be comfortable loaning him?  I'm not willing to do it.  I would have, if I had it, if I had the excess cash, I would have anything I could. 
[03:28:00]  I mean, I've got a little money set aside I've had.  It's more like a rainy, not even a rainy day fund, just money set aside, which I don't want to give up.  I've got children.  Sure.  Of course.  Yeah, absolutely.  And even though you love this guy, his fucking up or whatever caused his thing is not your issue, because you have a family.  Because it's like, I know he's got another business that everyone wants to get into, and he's not like, oh, if I just had this, I have it made. 
[03:28:30]  He's not handed that around at all.  But I know he could use this.  And I'd be willing to lose for him, but I'm just, well, my main concern is just what that'll do with him and I, if I give this to him.  Can you tell him that you'd love to, but you just don't have it?  Wait, say again now?  Could you tell him that, hey, look, I'd love to help you, but I don't have it?  I could, but he has not asked for this.  I mean, this would be a complete surprise to him.  Oh, I misunderstood.  He hasn't asked you for money? 
[03:29:00]  No, no, no.  He's not handed around.  He's not, if I only had this, none of that.  Oh, okay.  Then why all of a sudden are you saying that he, oh, you see him in trouble and you'd love to help him, but you're afraid it will change the dynamic?  Exactly.  Oh, I apologize, but I misunderstood.  So you have no issue then.  This is what you might want to do.  Think of how much you could afford to just give him as a gift.  Maybe that's nothing, but let's say you have an extra $1,500 that you could afford to give him as a gift. 
[03:29:30]  You might want to, because he might not want to borrow money for you.  So you could go up to him and go, look, do you want to borrow money from him?  He might go, like, what?  No, you're not a fucking bank.  No.  But if you have $1,500 that you could legitimately not mind losing, then you might want to give it to the person and go, look, here you go.  If you want to pay me back, that's okay.  But if you don't, honestly, it's a gift.  Or just give it to him.  Sometimes that would not change the dynamic of the friendship if you just gave him a little bit that you can afford to lose. 
[03:30:00]  You see what I'm asking?  Maybe I'm overthinking it.  But, I mean, I would be like, here's the money I know you need.  I'm like, fuck you.  You think you're better than me.  That's what would worry me.  Well, maybe you could ask him, do you need anything?  Can I help you?  That's if you want to do it.  If he hasn't mentioned it, dude, you're creating your own issue.  I know it.  I know it.  I mean, look, I would take a bullet for this guy.  Well, look, I've given some money to friends, too, okay, who are sick, who have medical issues. 
[03:30:30]  And I just send the money when I can.  And if I have it, I send it to them.  And they don't ask me for it.  And I don't want it back.  I probably wouldn't accept it back.  It's a gift.  So, again, if you're giving somebody a gift, you're giving them a gift.  And if he gets mad at you, you go, okay, sorry, man.  I was just trying to help you out.  No offense.  But he doesn't share to anybody.  God forbid anybody catches my voice and knows what I'm talking about.  But he's about to lose his house, his children.  It's a really bad deal.  And I just don't know. 
[03:31:00]  I would anonymously give it to him if I could.  But I just, you know, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, maybe you could talk to him then.  I would suggest talking to him and see how he'd feel about it.  That's all.  But he may not want to borrow money from his friend.  So be prepared to give it if he doesn't want to borrow it.  You know, again, he may not want it, buddy.  I hope you're upcoming callers.  Maybe, yes.  Anyway.  Good luck, buddy.  Thank you.  Have a great day.  Bye.  You send me money, I'll accept it.  All right.  Let's see.  Keith in Illinois, your ex's sister is showing interest in you.  How do you proceed? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  She spoke up with me about six months ago.  How long did you date her?  Uh, let's see.  I don't know.  Probably about six months.  Okay.  And the sister, did you know her before?  Did you get along with her?  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  And how is she showing interest in you?  Uh, just starting to talk to me and, uh, stuff like that.  And, and not just talk, you know, like really talk.  You know, maybe like hanging out, go to a movie sometimes, stuff like that. 
[03:32:00]  Trying to get me to hang out with.  Well, now, did she and her sister get along?  Um, yeah, I guess for the most part they do.  Did you think that the girl, the sister was interested in you at one point?  Uh, you know, I really never paid any attention.  So maybe she's always liked you or maybe she's just trying to motherfuck her sister.  You never know what someone's trying.  Well, that's what I was, yeah.  See, that's what I was thinking.  Maybe it was some kind of a, a revenge thing.  And I, you know, I didn't want to step into something and then get used and feel like complete fucking shit, you know? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, you don't necessarily want to.  Do you hate your ex-girlfriend?  No.  Uh-uh.  No, I just, uh, I just really don't talk to her anymore or anything.  But no, I don't have a hatred for her.  You probably don't want to do that then.  Let it go.  Move on.  You don't need that fucking dirt, dude.  I understand it's tempting, but I wouldn't, no matter how hot my ex's sister is, I don't think I could do that to her.  Unless you, you know, unless, again, I was just in a really, I'd have to really dislike somebody to do that to them. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because that's kind of, that's really, her sister's kind of a cunt for doing it.  Yeah, I, I, now that I look at it that way, I just kind of shitty, ain't it?  Yeah, it's her own sister and she's trying to fuck the ex or, or just hurt her with the ex.  I think she's trying to hurt her sister with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Well, thanks a lot, Jimmy.  All right, buddy, be good.  Billy in, uh, Boston, a junkie and I'm having troubles.  Oh, no, it's Bill in Boston.  Dan, I, I feel like the government's after me.  I'm getting high. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, no.  What's up, Bill?  Oh, not that, Bill.  All right, phew.  No, it's not, you nitwit.  Okay, what's up?  I've never talked to you before.  Hey.  Sorry.  Um, I got four kids.  I was sober 10 years.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, I just fucking came, uh,  I had, I had, uh, like a chance to pick up some, I ran into a guy that fucking, I used  to know that they'll drugs and he still deals them.  And I bought some, uh, 30s off him. 
[03:34:00]  Prox at 30.  Okay.  And, uh, and I just, uh, uh, you know, it hasn't taken over my life yet again.  Sure.  But I know it's there.  But you understand what's, like, what's happening.  I hate to say that you understand that you really are, you, you understand that the hammer  will drop.  You just don't know exactly when or where it will drop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just don't know when.  So let me ask you, how long ago did this happen?  It's been a year now.  Okay.  And you were sober for 10 years.  I'm sorry, but were you sober in a program of some sort? 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Were you?  I went to detox, you know, uh, 13 years ago.  And then, you know, I got out and I, you know, screwed around for a couple of years and  then I got serious about the program.  Now what happened towards the end?  Did you stop going to meetings?  Did you lose touch or was there a reservation in there?  No, my best friend died of a heroin overdose in my, in my sponsor.  Uh, I just, it just kind of blew up and said the wrong thing and I fucking walked 
[03:35:00]  Well, here's the reason I ask you that because Patrice died and I loved Patrice loved him  and it didn't even occur to me to pick up.  And the reason I'm saying that is not that I'm better than you.  I don't mean that, but, but meaning that what we do as addicts and you know, this  and alcoholics is we take anything we can.  And if, if our foundation is weak, when that fucking one moment comes where that part of  our brain knows that we're vulnerable, it just attacks and we use, and they, they say  picking up is the end of a slip, not the beginning.  Whatever went wrong, started going wrong before that. 
[03:35:30]  Um, my suggestion would be very strongly.  Don't look at the fact that the hammer hasn't dropped as an indication that it's not going  to be lucky that you have for so far, not overdosed and you have not lost everything and get back  to meetings fucking immediately.  All right, Jim, you know, you have to get back to meetings.  The fact, the fact that hasn't happened, you know, it's going to happen, dude, you will 
[03:36:00]  lose everything.  I know I got everything.  So what you can do is go back, tell your story and the way you can help people is okay.  Maybe your year out there wasn't devastating yet, but the way you can help people is you'll  eventually figure out what you were missing in the beginning and why this happened.  And then that experience will help other people because other people will be in that position  where, Hey man, it's the five year point.  A lot of times they say between five and 10 years, there's a lot less candles on the cake  because life gets good and we get lackadaisical and we go back out. 
[03:36:30]  So, uh, I would suggest, uh, getting sober, figuring out what happened and you can help  people.  All right.  All right.  Good luck, buddy.  Don't, don't stay out there cause you're going to lose fucking everything.  And you know that.  I know.  All right.  Good luck, man.  I hope you, I hope you do the right thing.  Be good.  Um, let's see here.  Uh, hi, Mary in Arizona.  Uh, should you be friends with your ex-boyfriend?  Well, let's, let's analyze this.  Okay.  Hey, how long did you date this cad for? 
[03:37:00]  Oh, almost two years, two years.  And when did you break up and why?  In a nutshell, he broke up with me one month ago today because he took me to church and  he just said, I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore.  I'm not in love with you.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.  And he kicked me out and, um, like I didn't talk to him for a couple of days.  And then all of a sudden it started like, he started texting, calling, I want to have  sex with you, like send me dirty pictures, stuff like that.  And so now he says he does love me, but he wants to start dating me, but not live with 
[03:37:30]  me and not be exclusive.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  He, uh, he was a little selfish to throw you out on sudden notice like that.  That's kind of a cocksucker thing to do for him to say, look, I love you, but I'm not  in love with you.  It's just honest.  And that happens to people.  And at least he told you, but I would say, uh, for him to boot you is very shitty.  And then a couple of days later to want sex.  And did he pursue you in this relationship in the beginning?  Very hard.  And Oh, it's Jim right before he broke up with me, like two hours before he broke up 
[03:38:00]  with me, he put it in me.  I was so mad.  Okay.  How long did he pursue you before you had finally agreed to go out with him?  Um, just like, I don't know, like a couple of months.  So what happens sometimes in a relationship is when we are the pursuer and we finally get  what we want, we get in a way what they call buyer's remorse, where sometimes the high of  getting the person wears off after a while.  And it's no reflection on you at all.  It's simply a reflection on the motives of the person doing the hunting. 
[03:38:30]  So it could be that he fucking, the idea of getting you is really strong.  And then when he finally got you, he had you.  There's no more challenge that then he gets rid of you.  And now he has to kind of challenge again.  And I'll bet if you start dating somebody else, he'll come after you harder because  he may be addicted to that chase.  I think so.  Oh my God, that makes sense.  So you have to decide, do you want to be with somebody that just likes chasing things  around?  Because he's probably going to chase somebody else.  And he probably misses that.  So he wants to do it with somebody else and he'll be much more interested in you. 
[03:39:00]  I bet when he's still single, if you hook up with somebody, he'll probably come and  pursue you much harder.  Nice.  Okay.  But I don't know if you want to be involved in that nonsense.  If you want a sincere guy who wants to just date you, maybe he wants the freshness and  newness of it again.  Because there's no high in your girlfriend sending you a cunt picture.  There is, however, a high in your ex doing it because it feels slightly inappropriate.  Yes.  I get it now.  Okay.  Okay.  So make a decision on what you want since you probably know what he's doing. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  I think so.  I can play with him for a little bit until I get bored and then...  Yeah, but you don't want to get hurt, so just, you know...  No, I don't.  I don't.  All right.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Good luck, sweetheart.  Thanks.  Bye.  There are all these whales stranded in the Everglades.  It's very sad.  Can't they get a boat and pull them out, put them in a net and drag them into the ocean  or some shit?  All right.  Let's see here.  We have...  Todd in New York has severe anxiety.  You know, it's funny, Todd. 
[03:40:00]  I go through the bouts of this myself, which makes it hard for me to sleep.  How are you?  I'm good, Jimmy.  Yeah, I have a business partnership, and lately I've just been showing up to work, and  I don't pull my side, yet my name's still on the business.  Okay.  And my business partners are getting really upset with me.  Sure.  What are you anxious about?  Anything in particular?  Everything.  My sexuality, my mother.  Okay.  Well, those are big things.  So, are you straight, and you think you might be bisexual or gay? 
[03:40:30]  I think I'm asexual, or I think I'm gay.  Okay, wait a minute.  So, asexual, you're concerned because you don't get the urge to have sex very often?  Right.  Were you abused sexually?  Not really.  My father did hose my ass out in the driveway once.  What do you mean he hosed your ass out?  With a real hose?  Yeah.  Now, why the driveway?  That's kind of publicly humiliating, no?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  So, what was the motive of that?  I'm not sure. 
[03:41:00]  I'm not sure.  My father recently died, and I think he might have been a closet homosexual, perhaps a pedophile.  I'm not sure.  Oh, is this fake?  Are you joking?  Oh, all right.  Thanks, Iraq.  Thank you for saying that.  I didn't catch that.  All right.  Did that happen to Fez?  Yeah, those are Fez's stories.  Oh.  As soon as he said the hose thing.  Okay, thanks.  Because Iraq was looking.  So, did Fez's dad really do that? 
[03:41:30]  He hosed him with a fucking...  Yeah, I think that's the story that Fez said one of the traumatic times was that he was taken out on the driveway or in the yard or something, and his dad hosed him down.  Oh, yeah.  That would be fucking...  That's embarrassing.  All right.  Let's see here.  Oh, the guy in Queens has a solution for the guy who wanted to give money to his friend.  Yes, this is what this show does.  We heal and we bridge.  Hello, sir.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  Well, love the show.  Thank you.  Sorry, love you.  Love the show.  Anyway, we had a similar situation with a family friend last year, right around the same time. 
[03:42:00]  And what we did, my wife and I did, was my friend also had kids, and I know the guy mentioned his friend's got kids.  And we got little gifts for him for the kids and told him, hey, listen, you know, bring the kids by.  Santa Claus left the gifts for him, gave him little gifts.  The kids were really happy.  And right then we just kind of slipped him an envelope with the check and said, hey, Santa left the gift for you, too. 
[03:42:30]  And at that point, I don't think we shamed him into taking it or anything like that.  It was a gift.  And, you know, everybody gets caught up in that sort of gift-giving.  Okay.  That's not a bad idea.  So maybe the guy you could use a childlike fictional character to give your friend.  No, I'm not teasing you.  That's actually not a bad idea.  I know what you're saying by saying that.  And that's not a bad suggestion.  So maybe the guy listening.  Or maybe what you could do is your friend who's having financial troubles offer to pay him to fuck his wife. 
[03:43:00]  That's a great idea.  You make him like a fucking Robert Redford offer, really humorous.  Yeah, there you go.  And I do have one question for you as far as I'm concerned.  I mean, can I like Uncle Paul too much?  I mean, does that make me creepy that I just really, really love him?  Not at all.  Uncle Paul.  Like, I love doing ship.  Okay?  I love it.  It's fun.  But Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul is my favorite.  And people, somebody recently on Reddit, I think, was like, Jim just does that too well. 
[03:43:30]  Do you think he, you know, and they were just a fan asking.  But honestly, there's no, I have zero pedophilia leanings.  Zero.  I think kids are fucking revolting.  And I thank you very much for the call, buddy.  I very much appreciate it.  All right, man.  And, you know, why, I don't know why, Uncle Paul, I have a very dark mind.  So, Paul, it's so fun to explore the humor of something so dark and terrible.  But that's the attraction of Uncle Paul for me, is to say these things like you get a little tent in your diapers. 
[03:44:00]  Like, as a real thought, that's repulsive.  And I think that Ian Watkins, I think he should be executed for what he did, for trying to fuck a baby.  I literally think that you should be decapitated by the state.  A hundred, yeah.  I think pedophiles, once they're convicted, beyond a reasonable doubt, should be killed.  But it is fun to explore things, which is why actors always want to play bad guys.  You ask most actors, and they'll say it's more fun to play a bad guy, because they like to explore the dark side of their psyche.  And, you know, in humor, how many taboo things are there for real? 
[03:44:30]  Pedophilia is a big one.  It's hard to be funny with that.  So it's kind of fun to explore the darkest thing you can.  And, you know, even around the holidays, I do that.  I know you say, well, the holidays, you shouldn't joke like that.  But what do I care?  And I know there's not a lot of time left before the holidays.  We all know that.

[03:47:30]  Or you can call 1-88-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Or online IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM  All right.  One more.  Mike in Ohio has a question on stand-up comedy.  Well, Mike, you're calling an expert.  Hi, Mike.  What's your question?  Hey, Jim.  Big fan.  Thank you, buddy.  I've done it a couple times and loved your show.  Thank you.  I am just started in the stand-up, and I think I write really funny shit, and then two days 
[03:48:00]  later, I think it sucks.  Is that normal?  Yes, it is.  The suggestion is a lot of times you just got to keep trying it on stage and taping yourself.  That's very, very normal.  And you never know.  Sometimes you're right.  Sometimes what seems funny in your living room is just dog shit.  But other times you lose the alive feeling of it when you thought of it, and that's why  it doesn't feel alive and good anymore.  You'll find out through the process of just performing how much is true that it was shit 
[03:48:30]  to begin with, or how much is, hey, that was really funny.  I'm just being irrationally critical.  Just keep performing the stuff and taping it, okay?  Okay.  The other question I have is, I grew up Amish, and I could do an hour of crap about that,  but I don't want that to be who I am comedically.  Sure.  Because I don't, I don't know, I would rather have 10% of the people think it's hilarious  than 90% think it's funny and kind of tacky. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, here's my suggestion, and I've got to wrap up, but thank you for the call.  I would suggest that's a great question.  There's a buddy of mine called Raymond the Amish comic.  He's got that market corner anyway.  You don't want to be the other Amish comic.  Raymond is great, and that's what he does.  So I would suggest mentioning it, because it is your life.  Talk about it a little bit, but talk about it in the context that you're comfortable.  If it's two minutes, it's two minutes.  Like, I don't want to see a black comic do an hour.  Who gives a fuck?  Or a woman, or a white guy talking about an hour.  Talk about it as a piece of your act. 
[03:49:30]  Whatever that piece feels comfortable is up to you.  But it's good to have diversity in your material.  And real quick, American Degenerate is on Netflix, and then here's my upcoming shows briefly.  Thursday, next Thursday, I'm doing my one LA show in X amount of years, the LA Improv.
