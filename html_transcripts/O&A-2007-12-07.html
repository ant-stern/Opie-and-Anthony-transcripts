<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a lengthy comedic bit centered around Jim Norton's new glasses, necessitated by upcoming LASIK surgery.  His eyewear became a running joke, with comparisons to various figures and comical descriptions of his impaired vision without contacts.  This was followed by a discussion on home invasion preparedness, contrasting Anthony's elaborate security system with Opie's more relaxed approach.  Opie's anecdote about finding a college girl's panties and examining them further fueled the comedic banter.  Briefly, Terry Schiavo appeared as a guest, expressing negativity towards the show.  Kenny from the Philly crew also guested, performing musical segments, including "99 Red Balloons" in German and "Friday, I'm in Love," and becoming the target of jokes regarding his size and attire.  A segment promoting listener-submitted wedding videos was also announced. A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to mocking Bruce Springsteen, his music, his portrayal of New Jersey, and his absence from the Grammy Album of the Year category, alongside discussions of other nominees like Amy Winehouse and Rihanna.  Listener calls further contributed to the Springsteen critique and featured a lengthy debate on the Plain White T's "Hey There Delilah," focusing on the lyrics' stalker-like implications.


The show continued with a discussion of Grammy nominations, focusing on Paul McCartney's perceived decline and Daughtry's potential.  M.I.A.'s music was played and debated, particularly the gunshots present in some versions.  A large former Marine caller admitted to crying during *Extreme Home Makeover*. A news story about a Long Island rape sparked a conversation on home invasions, home security, gun ownership, and the dangers of unlocked windows.  A tragic story about a toddler accidentally shooting a man was also discussed.  Steve's remixes of popular songs using a recurring soundbite were featured throughout.  Guests included Jim Norton, who discussed his book signing and diet, and Joel McHale from *The Soup*, with whom they discussed celebrities and TV shows, notably *The Tyra Banks Show*, including audio clips showcasing Tyra's dolphin phobia and an interaction with Omarion. The show also included a news story about a woman pouring hot grease on her sleeping husband.


The broadcast then featured a segment mocking the news report about the hot grease incident, with speculation on the events leading up to it and football picks from Jimmy's brother.  Brother Elmo's upcoming appearances were announced.  Further news stories were satirized: one about an intoxicated substitute teacher, Mary Kaminsky, and another about a principal found naked, watching gay porn, and smoking crack in his office.  Promotional announcements for Bill Burr and Caroline Rhea's shows at the Borgata, including a Bar 9 party, were made.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking audio clips from *The Tyra Banks Show*, particularly segments featuring children with illnesses, followed by similar mockery of Maury Povich's show, focusing on overweight children and their mothers.  Highly offensive language was used to describe the children and their parents.  The show concluded with a discussion of a perceived slight by a colleague, Than, sparked by a text message from producer Steve C., leading to further comedic banter with other staff members, including a "German guy" impersonation and interactions with an intern named Patrick. More promotional announcements and humorous banter ended the show.


Another section of the broadcast began with a discussion of Steve's recurring German character impression and a bizarre Craigslist/“wow” sticker skit.  A news story about a man shooting at people after a flatulence-related argument was followed by a brief discussion of a video of someone falling off a stage.  A phone call with Steve from Texas revisited the comedic impressions, including the "big dick" character.  A news report about a fight at a funeral where a man tried to "raise the dead" was then discussed. A studio sing-along with inappropriate lyrics followed. A news story about local inventor Stan Myers and his water-powered car, including speculation about his death and conspiracy theories, was covered.  The final major segment involved a news report predicting humans marrying robots by 2050, leading to a discussion about robots fulfilling the sexual needs of pedophiles and crude speculation about sex with robots.  The near-occurrence of a studio fire due to newspapers on hot lights preceded a call from Jay Moore, discussing his son's kindergarten application, featuring various impressions and tangents.  Finally, details for a "Roll Around in Honey for Money" contest were announced.

[00:30:00]  then when i leave the concert a limo takes me to my huge mansion here's the other thing that  bothers me about bruce he makes it so you can't hate him oh i try but he makes if you've ever seen  bruce springsteen you just described it perfectly who doesn't like a pair of jeans who doesn't like  a pair of work boots who doesn't like a nice comfy like you know shirt that maybe a construction  worker would wear or whatever and then he does have the bandana and then he has the american flag  yeah he's just he has every sports team represented on the stage like if you wanted 
[00:30:30]  to hate him you couldn't but that's trying too hard that's what i'm saying  so anyway this is a controversy because he didn't get a nomination right uh well he got four  nominations but uh the big one the album of the year for i think magic is his new album or something  like that you knew that and uh well i listened to the news on the way in so i'm informed what did he 
[00:31:00]  get nominated for i don't see anything here oh there it is okay all right really fast uh we'll get to  that uh grammy nominations album of the year yeah best rock album where he's nominated for best rock  album uh not album of the year you know what i'm saying yeah best rock album is like niche crap yeah  you want you want the biggie yeah album of the year you got um that's like best picture yeah  by the way what do you notice about album of the year you everybody it seems like they're they  really are trying to represent everybody equally only to get viewers you got you got foo fighters for  the rock dudes you got vince gill for the country dudes you got herbie hancock for the herbie hancock 
[00:31:30]  for the for that one where the mannequin robot legs are kicking yeah i thought he was a one-hit wonder  but i guess not herbie hancock older black people that's for like yeah i guess and then you got  kanye west for the rappers and then you got amy weinhaus for the uh for the for the drug down  well no for the misunderstood yeah the white kids were just hanging on i get it you like to party amy 
[00:32:00]  wow she's unpredictable you're outrageous i just saw a picture where they had a nice uh close-up of  her nostrils and it looked like she might have done a little of that coke dude she was one thing she  certainly knows how to get in the news all the time she is in the you open the newspaper every  day the daily news of the post in new york here she's in there all the time this song my my uh my  girl was humming this and love this song and i just wanted to smash her but then i kind of i got into  it i was like god damn i like this one let's be fair when this comes on still i i turn it up a 
[00:32:30]  little damn good song a little bit you like this one a little bit yeah she's an umbrella the other  one that's nominated she's just an emaciated kind of heroin chic thing she's like dustin hoffman  she's awful she's got a great voice though but she's we get it you're out of control misunderstood  you might die any day oh we'll watch she cancels too many shows i don't understand the attraction  to an artist that never shows up for live performances i've had enough of musicians  bruce shows up all the time of course he does never takes off hey wait a minute we got a blue

[00:35:30]  i can't listen to this type of music dude i i i don't know and the video is so sexy i i'm a big  fan of like catchy pop songs sometimes i think it's because all those years i was i was playing the rock  and roll that i i needed something different when these songs come on i definitely listen to them yeah  but i'd rather listen to like ridiculous uh pop songs like older ones yeah i can't listen to this 
[00:36:00]  crap i didn't like it either dude i hated it hey uh i don't i don't know if we're playing this one  here in new york but there's a song that i i i caught on another surface oh you know i listen to music  many different ways who doesn't uh and it's uh maybe someone can help me out they they they take gunshots  maybe it'll help our home invasion stuff that'll be a nice say they take gunshots and they and they uh  and they and they put it to music in a rhythmic way and it's so freaking catchy that doesn't sound

[00:43:00]  distance uh crap one time and by the time i got back to geneseo after spending a whole summer summer  pining away for this chick writing letters and stuff i get back to find out that she went back  out with her boyfriend in her in her small little hometown who was the star quarterback and they banged  all summer that's fantastic as i'm sitting there listening to the words of songs at the time and  and writing my letters this girl is getting oh isn't that wonderful every which way possible 
[00:43:30]  that was the last time i believed in a long distance relationship they rolled over on the  wet spot and crinkled on your letters right i bet you her ass like his letter was half sticking out  from under her ass as the quarterback just railed oh i was 18 years old and a douche it doesn't work  yeah you're absolutely right the internet wasn't what it is today i was writing my ass off yeah you  had to either write a letter or go there and i was i was checking the mailbox every day hoping for a 
[00:44:00]  return letter i had opportunities i'm like no man she had she had a mailbox right yeah she did she had  a lot of checking her mailbox she had a lot of deliveries herself you know what i mean overflowing  with letters right and here i am going no no man i'm i'm taking i'm an 18 year old douche taken  had this girl a girl uh of course lisa she went to quinnipiac college and uh had a summer that was  just fantastic uh inseparable it was uh it was amore amore and um then she goes off to um school 
[00:44:30]  quinnipiac it's in connecticut not too far but far enough away where ain't gonna be seeing you you know  every night and uh i visited the school a couple of times and uh it's kind of cool and then i noticed  some kind of a left turn took place and uh then i i got a phone call and she said uh uh hey uh anthony um  could you call if you're gonna come up you know because you usually i usually would just drive up 
[00:45:00]  and pop into her uh dorm and just go like hey how you doing you know we'd hang out and stuff and then  i got the old could you just call if you're gonna come up oh okay all righty i'll give you a call  i'll bet you that's so she could have gifts and stuff yeah that is so she could you know get  everything ready uh because she was so excited for me uh showing up dude yeah i i are you done because 
[00:45:30]  that you just remind me oh that's all i need to say because uh listen to this one uh so a lot of  people know that i went to geneseo you know western new york and then i uh moved on to i had a choice  when i was graduating geneseo i don't think i've ever told this on the radio i i i knew a lot of  people at geneseo that decided they were going to move to boston yeah okay like a lot i'm talking like  20 30 people it was this it was this movement for whatever reason everyone was going to graduate 
[00:46:00]  geneseo move to boston and start like uh you know getting their lives together plus also having a really  good time because it's like 20 or 30 people in a new city together i decided to stay behind  because i was starting my radio career in geneva new york at cq 102 hit music and more wow while my  friends went off to like bartend at the coolest bars in boston and get these like kind of white collar  jobs and they were rocking the tea and and just partying all over boston and i'm i'm swapping to 
[00:46:30]  my first radio job in the middle of nowhere right my girlfriend at the time decides she's going  to be one of these people and goes to boston and i'm like it's okay though me and buzzy who  was uh seeing this girl uh really serious at the time he ended up marrying her uh we decided every  weekend we'll just go to boston so we could still get our careers going but we'll go party in boston  with our friends from geneseo and she lived uh outside of boston actually got closer to like cape  cod area uh so anyway we were going up weekend after weekend after weekend how hard in our asses 
[00:47:00]  geneseo uh well rot it was rochester area it was it's a long ride two hours six seven hours  this is like a commitment you have to leave on a friday and then come back on a sunday because we  had real jobs we couldn't like blow up mondays or fridays it was like get there party leave sunday  morning type stuff and i was doing it and just like you said also i'm getting well uh yeah give me a call  when you're uh coming to boston like just what are you talking about we're kind of like going out you  know i was kind of seeing her so so i remember like all of a sudden she's blowing me off uh a 
[00:47:30]  couple weekends in a row she's like yeah i got the extra hours at the restaurant i'm not gonna be  able to see you this time around but you know you'll be back next weekend suspicious like anthony  was saying right so finally i i talked her in i go to boston i talk her into hey why don't we have  lunch and she was like all right but i i knew something was wrong and i have my i had my bag right  yeah i open up her trunk at the time to put my stupid weekend bag in and there were size 
[00:48:00]  god i don't want to exaggerate this but i got i'm i i think this is accurate what looked like size 13  basketball sneakers oh no oh that's not good oh that's not good oh yeah and then she finally came  clean new year's eve and said yeah i uh i uh i'm seeing somebody else and uh with the sneakers and  the size you probably didn't want to know who it was oh yeah explain why she was in the wheelchair 
[00:48:30]  what happened with your broad uh well we uh sorry and i i you know what i i got so excited i think i  did interrupt you no that's it's just she told me to to call uh and and i i did a couple of times um  and then it was pretty much i'm transferring uh from school from that school she went to a school on  on long island which was kind of closer uh yeah which was odd but again i couldn't show up or call  and then um she pretty much just was unavailable for any calls it was like i was supposed to call 
[00:49:00]  before i showed up but i could never get her on the phone so i never showed up and then it kind of  drifted away but then uh i was with uh some girl at a bar and she comes in all drunk off her ass  uh with this guy trying to get the guy to kick my ass well that's because why she wanted to talk to  you or something that she yeah yeah yeah she she she wanted to talk to me and then she complimented me  on my sexual prowess or something and uh she was all drunk and i said well you know i gotta go 
[00:49:30]  and uh then she wanted her boyfriend to beat me up but he wanted no part of it right i think he just  was gonna you know take her out in the car or something i don't know kumi is all hog i know you  are you're all hog you're just a little skinny weird twerp with poofy hair and just a tripod demeanor  like sam but i picture little walnuts yeah oh yeah i'm perfectly proportioned all right we gotta take  a break uh i don't even know what we're doing today we're beating up bruce we're beating up the 
[00:50:00]  grammy nominations oh can we play a little more of hey there delilah when we get back i like that  one this dummy pining away for delilah and she's just doing horrific things in new york city of course  she is because she can he's that's what it comes down because she can oh you go to the comedy cellar  and you meet up with a mediocre act and he puts it in your mouth in the car  say why you losing weight 
[00:50:30]  you know we gotta play more delilah now finding like rewind a little bitty rock after the break  we'll continue with uh hey there delilah and other things opian anthony  oops whatever you're checking out the opian anthony show we're just making fun of the plain white tees  hey delilah yeah a lot of people want to comment about that song uh melody from new hampshire what's  up melanie hold on start over melody you hear me yeah go ahead okay that song hey there delilah yeah 
[00:51:00]  sounds pretty and everything like that you know i like it i'm a girl whatever but um it's actually  kind of creepy because he only met the girl once she's a real girl she's i i forget why i looked it up  on wikipedia once and that's always right article about it huh we only met her once wikipedia is  always right of course it is anthony what's wrong with you see i thought it was a long distance i  already i thought they might have dated or something but it's someone he is really attracted to that's 
[00:51:30]  her yeah well i mean i mean he's attracted to it but like he met her once he kind of got across  and i asked her out she said no because she had a boyfriend and in part of the article she's quoted  as like yeah i hear it in the gym sometimes and i'm not really sure what to think it kind of puts  her off so the dude from plain white tees is a stalker basically he's stalking this uh delilah  girl and and she doesn't want anything to do with him and and so he writes this song and and she 
[00:52:00]  still is like whatever i don't want anything to do with you yeah and she hears it in the gym every  once in a while that's pretty interesting okay and the the interesting thing is the song came out  on the radio this year but it's actually three years old oh wow really oh really let me say this  how good is her boyfriend in bed what prowess does he have that he trumps this song when you write this  a good song and this guy wrote a really good song for this chick and uh she's like no i'm staying with 
[00:52:30]  the boyfriend because apparently he bottoms out well maybe delilah is waiting to see if this guy has  another song in him that's what i'm thinking one hit wonders aren't going to get the broad  you know if you're not if you're prolific she's a former columbia student and she's training for  the olympics now so she's obviously got like going on oh yeah okay he didn't you know try to hook up  with some slob then no no no she's not like believe me she's not some some chick from the midwest  right he thought she was gonna you know fawn over him i guess yeah and he wrote a little song 
[00:53:00]  what's what what's more of the song you maybe they maybe he tells more of the song all right let's  hear the lyrics let's hear plain white tease let's get back to hey there delilah hey there delilah don't  you worry about the distance i'm right there if you get lonely give this song another listen close your  eyes listen to my voice it's my disguise i'm by your side what a creep  oh it's what you do to me 
[00:53:30]  oh it's what you do to me  oh it's what you do to me  oh it's what you do to me what you do to me  hey there delilah i know times are getting hard but just believe me girl someday i'll pay the bills  with this guitar we'll have it good we'll have the life we knew we would 
[00:54:00]  you know what the bit is what the follow-up song would be because you know delilah is ignoring this  guy  if he's three years old yeah that explains a lot now he's paying the bills with it yeah he  probably sent it to her and she's like yeah this guy's kind of a sappy douche yeah now oh there's a  grammy it's almost like neil diamond finally came out and and and said who he wrote uh sweet caroline  about yeah all those years yeah and it was caroline hirsch who owns caroline's who knew 
[00:54:30]  i didn't know where you were going i didn't either it just came i put up my hand and it came out thank  god wow yeah she owns the comic club here in manhattan hey there delilah yeah it's gonna get a little  scarier now that she's ignoring uh the plain white teeth hey there delilah will you enjoy  columbia university even though it's on 110th street and you know there's a lot of  people to be careful of because those people will do things you don't like 
[00:55:00]  hey there delilah i wish anthony had his beep ready because i could have really plowed right through  that i know i suck that's right that's too late he's gonna he's gonna give her a knee injury  or something there for the future there's gonna be no more olympic uh training for this delilah girl  is there more pictures of her could you could you google her she's really pretty man yeah she's  all right i wouldn't mind uh taking her out for a for a soup at uh at hearty hails malted  ew she's like anorexic is she in that picture man look at her arms 
[00:55:30]  yuck all right we'll we'll uh link all these pictures up on onaradio.com later today everything  we talk about is visual on this radio show we link up on that site for you later on the day  all right let's move on screw up delilah and that dumb happens in the song hope what happens with  the rest of it he never gets the girl i know but he was gonna pay the bills with a guitar and then  what you need to know i would love to know i don't know i don't listen to this stuff all right 
[00:56:00]  is that your impression of a fuzzy guitar that's just what i do i'm a rocker man i can't help it you  mentioned rock and roll i'm out of my mind you listen to this stuff what do i know i put on some  sabbath wow you're rocking go ahead let's uh  i've got so much left to say if every simple song i wrote to you take your breath away i'd write it all  even more in love with me you'd fall we'd have it all 
[00:56:30]  he's presuming a lot what you do to me he's paying the bills for the guitar though  i guess nothing else it's just he just keeps talking about you know that's a lot of pressure  for this delilah's you know delilah's delilah's boyfriend my question is a lot of pressure there  let's just say he had a momentary infatuation with her and he moved like like kind of like neil  diamond did at that one point then you move on it's nothing it just becomes an artistic work as  opposed to the way you feel about the girl yeah you don't think he's still completely infatuated 
[00:57:00]  ah three years ago no no this guy's probably getting ass all over the place he probably kicked  a lot of the skinny ass out like a bag of antlers beat it stupid he's probably got a  at this point he probably has a list of girls names he's got to write songs for really  i wrote that song before i was having girls drop to their knees when i walked into the room  so uh do you think that the husband would you would you use this as your wedding song  uh because you knew it was written for her if you were marrying this girl but you also knew that  this guy wasn't some obsessed creep you knew it was no no you couldn't do that really no 
[00:57:30]  you couldn't do that why because he'd be a musical cuckold  just sitting there just some guy singing to your uh right your new wife okay all right everyone's  staring at you at the big table yeah this is written by that guy that really like and you  know it sounds to me uh and he probably would write his own vows and they would stink compared  to the song about nice you know we'll be together because i love you he probably go 
[00:58:00]  he goes well i guess everyone here knows that uh uh my wife uh had a song written about her three  years ago well you know i'm gonna sing her a song too that i wrote that's probably gonna be  the yeah another grammy nominated song i doubt it so if you would humor me for three minutes  uh yeah a band are we ready to go i wrote this myself it's about you delilah uh hey there delilah

[01:00:00]  we've all been to a million weddings and those best man speeches especially we want some of those  awkward and awful you know think wedding singer obviously and you know well boy that would be a  good one yeah no kidding but you know those really ridiculous moments uh from from uh from weddings gone  by i did something kind of creepy last night my girlfriend and i were there and uh we were just  sitting around and we uh put on the champ with ricky schroeder it was almost over why i don't know the 
[01:00:30]  first scene in the move that we saw in the film was like a half hour left was uh was when the champ  tells ricky to go on the boat and he and john voight slaps ricky schroeder and my we both of us were  crying inside of probably 40 seconds it was awful and then she was bawling so horribly because she's kind of  of like about hormonal so i went and got my tape recorder because like literally there's one point  where she was going it was like those type of just great tears i thought she was laughing at first 
[01:01:00]  um and i went and got my recorder and i'm like oh this is good because i wanted to  no i didn't bring it in because she didn't cry as hard i figured i wouldn't it once the champ is gone  all right just get another mushy movie yeah it's done oh she was but it was sobbing like  i was like all right already i like the champ too hon but all right i'll i'll admit one do you  have one uh what a crying moment yeah you can't cry by the way not watching any of that mine is a 
[01:01:30]  mine is a weekly one this is not good to admit as what good time being a shock jock this is not a  good thing to do but good times where you go uh wait is it a sitcom or a show it's a show and  every week i uh i have to awkwardly leave the living room and go hey uh you need anything from  the kitchen like kleenex i oh i'll be right back dude that extreme makeover home freaking show are you 
[01:02:00]  kidding brutal what they had but i've seen it it's not it's so last week they had four kids that all  might none of them are gonna make it to high school and they have all these health problems  is that what they're doing these days then they're just taking uh i hate yeah and also i'm  like what is this strange feeling i have it's emotion this this this moisture in the eyeballs  this is strange i don't openly ball but i get a little i get a little action going with that dumb 
[01:02:30]  show every week every effing week when they start chanting move that bus move that bus and then the  bus moves and you see the reaction of the family as they see their brand new house that they  supposedly built in a week yeah right yeah yeah that's the one that gets me i'll be honest your  show may be cry a lot too believe it or not lost i don't know why i cried a lot watching lost yeah  emotional wreck i've told you that but i don't know why that one got me really yeah certain moments of  it did wow like what i don't remember trying to to be honest i don't remember but i remember i i would 
[01:03:00]  sometimes sappy stuff just gets you that's why it's sappy it's yeah i hate to act like i'm i'd love to  tell you i'm above it but extreme uh extreme makeover move that bus extreme makeover oh yeah  they got you know you could have a whole marathon with yourself you go to youtube that's the beauty  of youtube they got the move that bus moments of every show they've done so you don't have to sit  through the crap of how they they're explaining how they're building stuff you just get to see  the moment where the family there was one family a black family where the lady falls on the pavement 
[01:03:30]  well that actually made me laugh really hard i think i brought that to everyone's attention  but the like the lady the mother oh yeah the you know my son was killed moment yeah but it's  actually for a new house she falls down and they gotta they're trying to run and get her before she  hits the payment and then one of the her daughters falls over that one was hilarious that one was  hilarious i think that they should uh only do extreme makeovers for burn victims and in every week  they give them the mask of another superhero but you're gonna be spider-man from now on and they give 
[01:04:00]  him a hat and white gloves and i'll stop bothering people scram all right hey sorry that was just  mean and basted nothing we have so much material we haven't gotten to anything which means we're  having a fine show uh grammy nominations there's two more categories we'll move on oh you do hard  rock well there's an opportunity here for maybe some uh well you know this one over here uh pest uh best  pop vocal album you got bon jovi in there oh you got this feist again it's amazing he's still relevant  you got maroon five you got amy weinhaus and then you got jimmy's favorite jimmy loves this 
[01:04:30]  oh my god that's right paul mccartney what do you think jimmy i do like him a lot i didn't like this  this trite dreck that he put out and that's all it was was was trite but he's drivel but he's  playing the ukulele oh dance we're gonna be not that no way it's kind of best pop vocal  album terrible paul mccartney memory almost full yes oh and they'll give it to him yeah 
[01:05:00]  it'll hop up everybody gonna dance tonight everybody gonna feel all right this guy wrote  with lennon this is what he's doing now he watched lennon right there's something to be said about  being taken out in your prime i know everybody gonna hit the ground are they he probably kept  screwing up the songs like lennon wrote strawberry fields forever and then mccartney said and the  next line should be we're gonna leave it never i'll take care of this one 
[01:05:30]  yuck all right and then finally best rock album that uh that daughtry he's uh he sold uh he sold  three million uh cds i heard he's the one from american idol right home he's nominated he's got an  amazing effing voice i think you've just seen the beginning of what this guy's uh capable of i'm not a  fan but i i you're not a fan of his stuff i i noticed on american idol like the first time he  sang i was like whoa okay this guy's got a voice yeah he doesn't have the right people behind him 
[01:06:00]  yet i think they kind of threw this band uh together his yeah and they got some really good writers to  you know throw out some songs that are very catchy and and people are really enjoying obviously but i  don't think i think when he really figures out what he's doing it it's gonna be way better than this  stuff way better and guess who's nominated for best hard rock performance i don't even go to  hard rock it's the first place i go uh best rock album so you got daughtry you got john fogarty  revival didn't hasn't he made that city like four or five times of course he has 
[01:06:30]  john fogarty i thought he was dead first of all john fogarty revival if you know anything about ccr  they have used that word of a few times it's in their name no i know but as far as yeah good point  i didn't even know that yeah but they've had albums also like revival and they're working off  that as well but foo fighters are in there bruce springsteen for best rock album when magic and  wilco and ozzy's nominated for i don't want to stop for best hard rock performance but that's only for  song song good good boy ozzy won't win i think i'll probably give it to the stupid foo fighters but 
[01:07:00]  hey stupid foo fighters exactly i don't know i don't know if this means anything to anybody except  myself but i was listening to you know something else and uh you know getting turned on to new  songs and stuff and there's this band uh mia and i think this is the chick that fell off the stage  the famous stage diver someone is telling us oh she don't want to woof woof do we have that iraq  this was a great clip where this chick uh the lead singer of this band mia i don't know much about 
[01:07:30]  him mia or mia or whatever she stage dove and there was no one to catch her and she hit the floor  yeah we played the clip a million times you got that e all right anyway i i think it's the same  person there's a song called paper planes and i heard this and i'm like man there's something  about this song it's catchy i don't know if i like it or what but it's definitely catchy i'm not  sure if i like i'm not gonna lie to you but i heard it and i like it made me turn my head and  kind of turn up the radio a little bit and and and go what is this about it's one of those catchy  songs by some we just got a taste here it is limey band they they do some interesting things uh with 
[01:08:00]  gunshots and the sound of a cash register just a taste don't worry  m.i.a is the name of the chick okay  i fly like paper get high like planes if you catch me at the border i go visas in my night  if you come around here i'll make more day i get one down in a second if you wait 
[01:08:30]  i fly like paper get high like planes if you catch me at the border i go visas in my night  if you come around here i'll make more day i get one down in a second if you wait  sometimes i think sitting on trains every step i get to i'm clocking that game everyone's a winner  we're making our fame bonafide hustler making my name sometimes i think sitting on trains  every step i get to i'm clocking that game the hook would be nice it's any second 
[01:09:00]  weird right i hate this chick it's just the accent yeah because she sounds like dana but she's 
[01:09:30]  trying to like embrace rap culture but she's just not cool there's something very interesting where  you guys get this version of the song uh i think it was it why because the version i heard those  gunshots are as clear as day and and the version we just play it sounds like maybe strategically it's  more in the mix so it's not so it's not as obvious i'm wondering or if it's just an itunes  download that whatever isn't it isn't uh of good quality whatever i just want to throw that out 
[01:10:00]  there today and uh here is the um stage knife  do you got the long version yeah here's the long version because the song ends it's not the same  girl people are saying by the way well we might as well play it listen to this  good hey uh we got sean in boston listening on bcn heading toward a break here but first sean what's 
[01:10:30]  up hey hey uh which one of you guys is just saying that uh you were crying over uh what was it extreme  home makeover look i already look like a wuss here i i what i what i say hold on hold on i i get  a little moisture i'm not openly bawling but i get a little but in a different area in that show

[01:13:00]  what i said i i'm not really sure if i like the song but it's different enough where it made me  like take notice and go wow there's something a little different going on a little catchy for some  reason yeah i don't know i'm not really sure i like it but it was it was different and someone's saying  that uh they're sampling the clash in that song maybe that's a little obscure going down the music  road but supposedly that uh that gunshot thing is from possibly a clash song so i don't know what did  you think of that song lisa it's okay what did did it pique your interest or you're like whatever 
[01:13:30]  whatever okay it's not my thing fair enough fair enough love you all right love you lisa in dub bronx  we should take a break right we got a woman pours hot grease on sleeping husband  we got uh the home invasion story that we were supposed to start to show yes very frightening  uh mall killer update oh there's your update we ain't giving that effort any time on this show

[01:18:30]  stomach that's flat so i was saying i got some really good abs under this little small layer of  fat i can still grab two handfuls of fat i want to kill myself via slicing my fat forehead open  are you waiting for us to go oh no don't do that jimmy no i'm expecting you to encourage me  to get me fresh razors if i just walk into the studio for the first time  i always wonder when people like kind of admit something like serious on our show if they're 
[01:19:00]  expecting us to be like hey no why would you ever no no all right home invasion time yeah oh this  this is anthony's favorite subject this is a subject that uh it terrifies me i'm still fighting a good  fight and i just think uh anthony might be a bit paranoid nope a little bit a little bit i address it in  my podcast that i'll never ever get online i actually have it i just got to get somebody to  host it so um you got to send me an email or something you got a 20 minute video ipod i went 
[01:19:30]  off a little long look it's my first video ipod i really put together and i was just going off the  cuff i wasn't scripted or anything i sat in front of my camera uh in my office and uh the whole segment  is anthony's office where i could go in there and just uh pontificate and i mentioned you know it's  it's uh different than the opie and anthony show because i don't have opie or jimmy uh making fun  of me and my my my thoughts on on home invasions and calling me crazy i don't think you're crazy 
[01:20:00]  actually you know i am yeah but i i think you're right about the home invasions but then i i'm called  and i mentioned this also like i'm called a little excessive maybe a little overly concerned  yeah uh but then when you see all these home invasions uh that's that's when i i start saying  see see so i put together like a thing that shows what i do uh what i have to protect myself what you  should do to protect yourself it's like a public service message although i am drinking during it 
[01:20:30]  what i like about your video ipod yes a video uh uh podcast i finally got to see your house yes  the inside of my office very nice that's uh oh great you got a nice joint there it's nice i pulled  a little chair in there uh lighting you should see it it looks like a studio now yeah but i i put it  all together and uh it's i can't stand the thought of being in your own home uh it's your own house 
[01:21:00]  house you you're you're looking at things that are very familiar to you family things on the wall  pictures and at the same time you're you're being a big fist is bashing you in the face and you're  going i'm i'm home this is my house it's supposed to be the safest place ever and here i am getting  pummeled my my wife or daughter getting ravaged in the back room and and there's nothing i could do 
[01:21:30]  about it because i didn't give this any thought well here's the latest home invasion yep and a  woman on long island is recovering this long island thank you sex attack she was at home asleep in north  of avalon tuesday night when a masked man came in through the window there you go okay hold on right  there what came in through the window came in through the window yeah well that's what the you  know the beatles joe cocker who was it no you don't come with that's they just came in to sing 
[01:22:00]  did you give me that came in through the bathroom window it's it's very normal to keep your windows  open what no it's not it is probably the worst thing people could do because they're always coming  through open windows you dummies and i also address the fact that if you're having work done  to you need some of that december fresh air then uh turn on your air conditioner and get some cool air  to blow in because there's no way my windows are are opened or unlocked unless i am home and armed 
[01:22:30]  because i'm not going to have some guy flying through a window and not be able to blast them right  back out again it just ain't gonna happen to me uh but the open window thing and i bring this up  because you were talking about how you have workers at your house yeah now obviously you're pretty high  up in a building i don't think you got to worry about uh a superhero spider-man coming in spider-man  might cause you some problems if he decides to go to the dark side i'm yeah i'm effed yeah the black 
[01:23:00]  suited spider-man you're screwed yeah uh but i'm talking about suburbia you know you got your house  the windows are at ground level like that you can't leave them unlocked and if you have people  come in that work on your house check every single window and make sure it's latched when they leave  hold on hold on hold on yeah you came in through the back yeah there you go uh-huh the beatles  encouraged us back in the day yeah real silver spoon's all you got should have it protected by a gun 
[01:23:30]  came in through the bathroom window i blame the beatles for for everyone leaving their windows  unlock yeah came in through the bathroom window  yeah 
[01:24:00]  this is what it sounds like when doves cry  can we get to the rest of the story and uh you know there's there's this is a very serious 
[01:24:30]  story we understand of course let's separate the the comedy from the seriousness of what happened to  this uh poor lady out there on long island all right we want to acknowledge that yes we do night  when a masked man came in through the window and raped her the suspect is described as a slim man who's  about five foot six people in the neighborhood were shocked to hear about that vicious attack  even in the neighborhoods themselves there needs to be more watch more police out and i was robbed  once so i've learned my lesson they came through a window and that's i've always i lock the doors even 
[01:25:00]  when i'm home see who is that person uh of special resident jimmy why who cares what she does she  lives on the 11th floor no one cares about her you weren't raped i lock my windows yeah do you good  then why are we talking to you you have to lock those windows and when you have workers come in  you don't know you don't know if one of them is uh not trustworthy they leave a window open they  unlock it and then they tell their friends hey i left the window unlocked and then before you know it 
[01:25:30]  home invasion home invasion now you're screwed well you're there with your family uh uh and and and  that's no time to be thinking about hey what do i do now i got that phone cord around my neck um i'm  being a pistol whipped and what do i do hmm what do i do this is a great time to really think this out  when i'm moments away from maybe being shot you gotta you gotta be prepared let's say hi to tim in  rochester we don't hear from rochester that often why not why not tim uh because they've got rovers 
[01:26:00]  morning glory on in the morning which sucks hmm well that wasn't nice why don't you like rovers  morning glory uh because do g is to see you next tuesday the one i don't know who do we like those  guys all right tim what do you got for the show now that you heard everybody with anthony yeah ah see  i keep one chambered and five magnums ready to go somebody comes through my front door i'm gonna 
[01:26:30]  light them up like a christmas tree oh see that's nice is it possible to light someone up like a  christmas tree i don't think literally i'm always figuratively speaking all right tim uh what about  loaded guns in the house that can be dangerous too right um no well we got a story that says yes  okay curtis collins's family says he was doing what he loved last night when he died police say a  single bullet to the head killed collins and a two-year-old had the gun it happened here on 
[01:27:00]  stone what was it baby finster baby face finster oh finster baby nutty finster  gone it happened here on he had a load in the gun and a load in his pants  his little diety diaper would have been a much funnier line boy he might have been shocked he must have  been shocked when that thing went off the whole story is ridiculous you know well it gets interesting  well was it his gun or did the kid bring it it was the kid's gun the gun it happened here on stonewall 
[01:27:30]  street collins's family says he was working on a cd at this recording studio trying to make it in the  music business he was a good-hearted person he liked to make people laugh he loved to sing and dance  ballasthorpe and curtis were engaged to be married pregnant with his baby  she's due in just two months of course why not investigators say a loaded gun sitting on a table 
[01:28:00]  was in reach of a curious toddler and the night quickly turned tragic brunswick police chief edna  johnson says the gun didn't belong to collins and she says it certainly didn't belong in the hands of  a child obviously um someone wasn't watching and the child was able to how do you just have someone  else's gun laying on the coffee table that's loaded ready to go see this isn't it's not your gun this  isn't the way i'm talking about being safe at home uh there's a gun laying on a table there's a two-year-old 
[01:28:30]  running around they don't know whose gun it is how do you if you walked into your house and saw a gun  sitting there i'd make the face like bruce willis did when he walked back into his apartment uh to make  those uh toaster pastries and saw the gun on the shelf on his counter that's exactly what i would do  it's like what the hell is that there's a gun on my counter wow but this guy just is is recording uh 
[01:29:00]  music there's kids running around and there's a gun on the table that no one knows who it belongs to  wonderful played with the gun and the gun discharged i can't see a two-year i can't see how a two-year-old  could pull the trigger forbes says none of this makes sense to her and she has a lot of unanswered  questions but right now the family is focusing on collins listening to his music and remembering the man  they loved and the family says they don't know this two almost three-year-old they believe though that he is 
[01:29:30]  the son of a friend they don't know the kid dude they don't know the kid or who owned the gun  why do i think it's a friend uh this two-year-old did not it was an adult that shot him and they're  blaming the kid does they they're gonna have they'll do a powder test of the kid this is not  the kid yeah you think that's gonna be the case we don't know who the kid we don't know who the kid  is or where the gun came from or anything he just showed up with a bus ticket and his bags he's two  he's two years old running around their house and they don't know who he is and there's a gun on 
[01:30:00]  the table and they also found a pound of cocaine which they believe the kid brought with him  yeah this kid's just evil gave him a columbian necktie  kid slapped him and demanded to know where the money was this kid's a problem  uh we got new uh steve remixes new steve remixes i think we can fit them in before we go to break  here uh of course we know oh i didn't realize the sounds of steve what 
[01:30:30]  this is him warming up his voice before he does production for the show  the listeners have taken those sounds and they've uh thrown them into some very very popular uh songs  excuse me we got that uh bon jovi one i'll start with that  all right that just doesn't get old no we got we got two new ones that we got to play for everybody  today uh but first this is the one that a lot of people are requesting those sounds put to a bon jovi 
[01:31:00]  song  oh 
[01:31:30]  I like that one.  I can't work these CD players anymore.  They're getting worse and worse.  Brad the Rooster in Michigan came up with that one.  All right, very good.  And then Van likes this one.  Actually, a lot of people on Instant Feedback like this one, too.  We have only played it, I think, once, maybe twice.  It's Chris in West Virginia took Steve's sounds  and put it to a little song we all know and love from the old days. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[01:32:30]  What?  What?  There you go.  What?  And then now we got two new ones, two quickies.  We'll start with, yeah, we'll do Skinny Pete.  New ones.  Two new ones.  They keep coming in.  By the way, we were kind of throwing the idea around during break. 
[01:33:00]  Maybe a little Barking Dogs for Christmas time.  Yes, Barking Steve.  Barking Steve could be good.  All right, here's this one.  Okay.  Even though you know where it's going.  Yeah.  I didn't realize. 
[01:33:30]  We got this one that came in, the last one for today, from Austin.  Austin came up with this next one.  Just waiting for it to queue up.  Who would have thought so much mileage out of that?  Out of some dumpster.  Some stupid Steve sound. 
[01:34:00]  This is stupid.  It's absolutely stupid and hysterical.  Just when I think the bit has run its course.  I don't know, man.  Then you hear a new one, you're like, I think I need to hear more still.  And they've all been good.  Yeah.  All right.  Quick break and we'll continue, right?  Right.  We still got the Canadian PSAs. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, my God.  How are we going to fit all this in today?  Do we have new ones or the same ones?  No, the Canadian Accident.  Spilled my coffee.  The greatest.  The Canadian Accident Prevention PSAs.  Can we get the Spilled My Coffee one?  We've got to replay that.  It's got to be bleeped.  We do?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He really curses.  Oh, does he?  Very realistic.  We got a clean version of that?  All right.  We'll figure it out during the break.  And then we got these new Canadian Accident Prevention PSAs that are very disturbing.  Mm-hmm.  They're very interesting stuff.  And I think we're on top of what's going on in the world for the most part. 
[01:35:00]  I don't see.  Yeah.  We're all right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Still lots to do on the Opie and Anthony show today.  We've got Roland.  He has stopped by to stick up for Bruce Springsteen.  That should be good.  Oh, great.  I have an...  E-Rock called me.  Is Joel on the phone yet?  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'll get to this after Joel.  Just remind me that E-Rock called me last night.  So I had to...  Is it Quirk?  Yeah, Eric.  He just called me.  And he had a story for me.  So I would pass it on to you.  I got a call at like 7.30 last night. 
[01:35:30]  I never get calls from Eric.  And what do you have for Jim Norton there, E-Rock?  Um, went to, uh, Dennis Leary's book signing to get Jimmy's book signed by the cast of Rescue Me.  And, uh, Dennis announced that we need to sell more books in order to beat Jimmy Norton  because he's too important to come down to get his book signed for himself.  That's the story I got.  Thank you, by the way.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:36:00]  What?  What?  What's the publisher's name?  Ow.  Carrie Gordon.  And why did you want me to thank Carrie Gordon?  You didn't finish the story because that part of the story...  Oh!  You probably think this kid...  All right.  That story sucked, but there's more to it.  Oh, there's more.  Radio Gold about to happen.  Yes, E-Rock.  Go ahead.  Carrie and Adam Ferrara got me to the front of the line.  So I was first on line to get Jim's book signed in front of 500 people.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:36:30]  Getting back from break here.  I know you were doing me a...  Did you get your book signed?  Then shut up.  You weren't doing me a favor.  You were using my name to do you a favor.  Yeah.  Stop being a braggart.  Yeah.  Cutting the line.  Those people work hard for a living, and they're sitting there for hours to get their book signed.  But he made it seem like he...  Why don't you brag a little more?  This is what bugs you about you, Rock.  He made it look like he did me this big favor, but he wanted the cast to rescue me to sign  his book.  Yeah.  And he just...  He used you to get to the front of the line.  I'm just a whore, but thank you.  Also, let's say hi to Bill Burr. 
[01:37:00]  Hi, Bill.  Bill.  Hello, Jim.  Nice having you back.  Yeah, I got in the car coming over here, and the first thing I heard, the second we turn  on the radio, is I hear you going, you live on the 11th floor.  You didn't get raped.  That must sound really funny out of context.  You're just turning on your radio, and you just hear a line like that.  Oh, it's hilarious.  You don't know what it means or what they were discussing.  Yeah, I'm like, all right, these guys are in full sprint.  Yeah, we were in our home invasion mode.  Of course.  Talking about home invasions.  And we also have Roland in studio. 
[01:37:30]  Roland, I know you're wearing the Bruce Springsteen shirt.  That's terrific.  Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band shirt he's got on.  And I will say it again, the most overplayed and overrated artist.  One of the most in rock history.  Did you see him?  He kind of put his hand out at you and went, I disagree.  Why don't you defend Bruce Juice?  Well, I mean, to me, it's like the greatest band ever.  I mean, Bruce wrote Born to Run at 24 years old, so he did tell about his middle-aged stories with his friends. 
[01:38:00]  His what?  About his stories, because Jimmy said, like, you didn't know about his, like, upbringing.  I answered that.  Oh.  Yeah, I said that.  I like two songs by him, and Pink Cadillac is not one of them.  Pink Cadillac, run down the street, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, jersey.  What?  That's a rare song in concert, though.  Oh, yeah.  You have to sing, like, ten nights, and they'll hear it once.  Really?  That's great. 
[01:38:30]  So why should we like Bruce?  Ten nights.  Jesus, the guy can't sell out places.  Defend your hero.  You saw him how many times on the last tour?  Oh, the last tour, I saw him 22 times.  22 times.  I saw him eight times this tour.  Did you take your top off?  No.  It's good you're not using your connections in the business.  Wait, you saw him eight times when he was in New York alone?  Yeah, well, this tour, though, and there's rehearsal shows on that.  And I heard a number that was coming out of his mouth right before that.  Yeah, how many times have you seen him total? 
[01:39:00]  78 times total.  78?  78.  78 times.  And I'll go to the, remember, 15 nights in Jersey this summer.  Every night you'll go.  15?  Yeah, every night I'll go.  You'll go to 15 nights.  Why would you do that?  Because each night's different.  He does, like, different set lists.  Like, eight to nine different songs each night.  And then he'll make special T-shirts.  Different stories about factories.  Yeah.  About working class guys and the Jersey Shore.  Yes, well, I mean, he doesn't have any opening bands because he doesn't need it.  And he just hops on. 
[01:39:30]  No one's buying this working class guy anymore.  I picture, after a Bruce Springsteen show, that he goes back to his mansion like Batman  used to go back to his lair.  Yeah.  But it's all underground, freaking tunnels and stuff.  Clarence drives him home.  Because he doesn't want, yeah, because he doesn't want his fans, you know, knowing where he actually  lives.  In a gated community in a massive mansion.  Takes off his working class jeans.  Right.  Puts on some slacks.  Yeah.  Takes out a pipe.  Well, he signs autographs for the fans. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, does he?  He knows everyone's famous.  What else does he do?  Wave at them?  Through the car?  No, he points at you.  Has he ever pointed at you?  Oh, yes.  Yeah?  After the ninth night, he's having security look at you.  Yeah.  He's like, hey, security.  Who's the Hawaiian chick staring at me?  The Samoan.  So, Roland, doesn't it lose its luster by like, I mean, I'm a Sabbath freak.  No.  But I couldn't see them 15 nights in a row.  No.  By the sixth night, don't you like, all right, you're just as excited?  Yes. 
[01:40:30]  Do you cry the last night?  No, just get misty-eyed because he does Jersey Girl the very last night.  Oh, good.  Thank God he saves that one.  Jersey Girl.  So, the 15th night, so you get off, finally.  What's that song about?  A working class girl in Jersey who blew somebody in a factory?  Jersey Girl.  I don't even know Jersey Girl.  It's Tom Waits' song.  It's a cover.  Oh, good.  You were at 30 Rock this morning?  No, that was a while ago.  Oh, no.  A while ago?  Okay.  I was there at 30 Rock at 5 a.m. to watch him. 
[01:41:00]  You could have said like at some point, Iraq, write down, it wasn't today.  Yeah.  At 5 a.m.  For the Today Show.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bruce was playing the Today Show, so you went and got there at 5 in the morning  to watch him.  To watch him.  Yeah.  You're right in the front.  Did you have a sign?  I love you, Bruce.  I had a special pass I could blow by people.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did you get to meet him?  Yeah.  You've met Bruce before?  How many times?  Three.  Three.  And did he remember you? 
[01:41:30]  Yes, because he said I look unique.  Also, while we have Roland in here.  Because we've got to get to Joel McHale from the soup.  Oh, God.  We hear you do the best Steve impression.  Oh, sorry.  I don't know.  Hold on.  Let me get the noise for everybody again.  But we all do the noise around the office.  You know this.  Oh, I didn't realize.  But we're hearing you do the best one.  I go, oh, I'm just too angry right now. 
[01:42:00]  What did he just do?  Oh, I'm just too angry right now at everybody.  Seriously, Iraq.  Oh, my God.  I got the DCs.  He does these impersonations.  Let's say hi to Joel McHale.  Joel, I'm really sorry you had to hear the last few minutes of our fine radio show. 
[01:42:30]  I want to know when Roland's getting his own show.  Oh, boy.  You can give it to him.  The Bruce Springsteen orgasm hour.  Hey, Joel, why don't you even acknowledge that we're friends on that show called The Soup?  Well, I don't have friends in an E.  They don't let you have them.  And if I don't say that Ryan is my friend, my best friend, then I get in huge trouble.  Yeah, it's all about Ryan.  Ryan Seacrest.  That's the Ryan Seacrest network.  That guy's good.  How about you save a few jobs in entertainment for other people? 
[01:43:00]  Well, when he runs out of time, then that will open up some jobs for all of us.  No, I know you know and like Ryan, but honest to God, they put him in a lot of places where  there's a lot of men and stuff, and I don't know any guys that like him.  I think Joel doesn't really like Ryan Seacrest.  Well, Joel has never said that.  I mean, but if we say, like, Ryan sucks, Joel kind of smiles and nods.  Just listen to how he talks about Ryan.  Read between the lines.  He has a team of snipers. 
[01:43:30]  He does.  Wow.  I often will just be doing the dishes, and I look down, and there's a little laser on  my chest.  Yeah.  And I know that it's him.  Hey, Joel, are you a big Bruce Springsteen guy?  No, not really.  Good.  I mean, sure, I like a few songs, but I didn't realize, I mean, I've known Roland for a while  now, and I never realized what he actually is.  A creep.  He really is creepy.  Roland, by the way, refuses to wear coats in New York City in the winter. 
[01:44:00]  It's freezing cold.  He goes out.  He'll be out in that Bruce Springsteen t-shirt.  It's bizarre.  Walking down, and not even, and he's not cold.  He's sweating.  Yeah, he's sweating.  Yeah.  All he needs is a copy of one of the CDs in his back pocket, and he's good.  Yeah.  This shows how pathetic my life is.  I got a pair of tickets to see the Islanders and the Rangers here in New York City.  Nice.  And after trying to figure out who would go with me, and I realized I don't really have  friends, I had to call Roland, and I met him on a street corner, and it was a cold night 
[01:44:30]  here in New York.  I had my puffy coat on.  I had a hat, gloves.  You know the deal.  And I meet him.  He's on the corner in a t-shirt, in a Rangers old school t-shirt.  And then you're on your way to an ice rink.  Yes!  He's standing there with his terminal flop sweat.  Yeah.  That's what he's got.  Roland is a very hairy guy, though.  Yeah.  Except where you need the hair.  Yeah, right on top of your head, which is always bizarre. 
[01:45:00]  But like his back.  Has he ever been mistaken for a Sasquatch or something?  He always looks like he's bombing.  He does.  On like a really important set, too.  Like on Letterman.  Not just like a late night club.  Hal Talk is coming up with it.  They're saying Roland looks like George the Animal Steel.  Like a younger version of George the Animal Steel.  That is not a compliment.  Joel, how's the soup going?  You know, as long as Tyra keeps on the air, you guys, we can keep the lights on. 
[01:45:30]  Joel, we're on the same page with this Tyra.  We were just saying the other day, we just don't give this Tyra justice on our show.  We can't make it work.  Because it's such an amazing thing.  But I don't know if we do a good job with it.  She makes this show all about her all the time.  No matter what subject she talks about.  It's very hard to get a word in edgewise or to get your story out without Tyra jumping on and saying,  That happened to me. 
[01:46:00]  And then she just goes on and on about how it happened to her.  And leaves the guests hanging.  She talks about her, the hardship she suffered as a young model in Paris.  When she was alone and didn't have her mother.  Her poor life of her making $25,000 a week walking down a runway.  Horribly tough.  And now you guys have her in New York.  They ran her out of L.A.  Yeah, they threw her out of L.A.  This week we got a clip of she's trying to talk to young hip-hop stars about what they're like in bed. 
[01:46:30]  And this guy named Omarion told her to shut up.  And it might have been the greatest moment on the Tyra show I've ever seen.  Wow, really?  What does she do?  She's like, Omarion, what would you say to me in bed?  And he goes, say something.  And she starts talking and he goes, shut up.  Good.  And I was like, yes, a genius.  Did she laugh, try to laugh it off?  I think she had already started another story about her hard time. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  You know, trying to touch a dolphin during a swimsuit.  Yeah, one of her.  That was my favorite show of all time.  She was petrified of dolphins.  Yeah, she did one of those phobia shows.  And we learned that Tyra is afraid of dolphins.  Something you could pretty much avoid.  Yeah, that's like being afraid of glaciers.  Don't go near them, you're fine.  But she had to conquer her fear of dolphins.  So she went down to like a SeaWorld or something and jumped in a tank where, of course, the dolphins down there are very well trained. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  And she finally, the big culmination of this show was her kind of touching the dolphin's little head in the water.  She invited people on her show that had real serious fears.  Right.  Like people, you know, like agoraphobes and people that could not be around other people.  And she started trying to tell her story and had to bite her lip.  Yeah.  In case she started crying.  But the best part after they spill their guts out, she goes, I also have a fear. 
[01:48:00]  And then the music stars.  When I'm doing the cover of Sports Illustrated.  Right.  Making $7 million.  Right.  And they tell me to go into the surf in the Caribbean.  I get so scared.  If I were to hear the theme song from Flipper, you might as well be playing the Death March.  I feel like 9-11 survivors.  Oh, my God.  I was 5-11 in the eighth grade.  Everyone made fun of me how tall I was.  She is a little self-centered. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  We also got that Tila tequila on our radar.  Oh, right.  Right.  Hold on.  Before you move on with that, we found the Tyra Dolphin Club just to bring everyone on  board.  Oh, right on.  It's a quickie.  Today, my guest and I are coming face-to-face with our fears and phobias.  Now, some of the fears that you're going to hear today may sound funny to some people.  But trust me, from my guest and from me, too, the fear that we feel is absolute terror. 
[01:49:00]  Now, people may laugh at my fear.  My fear is dolphins.  You think a dolphin is sweet, it's cuddly, but to me, they're not.  They're not cuddly.  Why aren't they laughing at her?  And I feel panic whenever I'm confronting or even thinking about or talking about a dolphin  is happening right now.  I went to SeaWorld to try to conquer my fear.  And here's a little teaser.  Dramatic music.  Right now, I'm at the Loberge Del Mar Resort and Spa, and I came here a couple of days. 
[01:49:30]  Resort and Spa.  This has got a horrible moment for her.  I'm at a resort and spa.  After my seaweed wrap and my mud massage, I decided it was time to conquer my fear.  You hear that stupid whore was plugging the place she was at when they gave her a free  stay?  How irritating.  After I had five umbrella drinks.  SeaWorld shows would begin with that music. 
[01:50:00]  She'd be terrified of these killer whales and dolphins.  I got to hear that again.  The resort.  Oh, boy.  And then she had a show where she dressed up as a stripper.  Yeah.  And she wanted to see what it was like to be a stripper.  And she was going to go out on stage and dance, but she just couldn't bring herself to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the end.  And we were like, God forbid she walk out on stage barely wearing any clothes to make  money.  Yeah, that's what she did.  She walked down the runway. 
[01:50:30]  You could see through half of the crap she was wearing.  It wasn't Victoria's Secret stuff.  That's the problem.  It was not nearly as fierce as I was expecting it to be.  I rewound a little bit.  Here's the dolphin clip.  Right now I'm at the La Berge Del Mar Resort and Spa, and I came here a couple of days early  because I needed to relax.  I needed to kind of meditate because I really do have a true fear of dolphins, and I know  I'm conquering that today, but I couldn't just arrive today and just jump straight in because  that would freak me out.  So I've been relaxing here, kind of getting into it, and I'm ready. 
[01:51:00]  Do people understand how ridiculous this is?  It's almost like she's doing it on purpose.  At the resort.  Can anybody be that out of touch?  Right.  How ridiculous that is?  Like the average woman that would watch a Tyra show, like who's struggling, like a housewife  and four or five kids can relate to this, that she needed a couple days at a really nice  resort to get ready to conquer her fear.  Like a battered wife?  People haven't even seen a dolphin, ever.  Right. 
[01:51:30]  Exactly.  It's like I'm afraid of spaceships.  It's so bad.  Spaceships.  Right.  Yeah, you've got a fear of spaceships.  And it's coming in like a lot.  Who cuddles with dolphins to begin with?  You don't cuddle with a dolphin.  Yeah.  No, of course not.  Why would you have an opportunity ever to hug a Gordon?  It's so great.  Oh, it's great.  I have a big fear of sharks, but I just don't go in the ocean, so it doesn't consume me.  Problem solved.  It does not consume you.  When you look at the ocean, do you just cringe and stay away just in case the sharks might 
[01:52:00]  be, you know, going for you?  I've got a big fear, too.  I've got a big fear of streets that are over 100.  Yeah.  I've got a big fear of number streets over 100.  So guess what?  I just don't go there.  That's really smart.  Thank you.  I have a fear of old record players.  Ooh.  Like phonographs.  Yeah, the ones that you crank.  Yeah, the crank ones.  Those are scary.  It might as well be a guillotine, because I am terrified.  Hey, we've got that other clip. 
[01:52:30]  What is his name?  Omarion?  Omarion, yeah.  Omarion, okay.  This is the clip you referenced we got now played to bring everyone on board here.  We're talking about all love and sex today.  What about lovemaking?  Do you like to talk during lovemaking?  I do.  You like to talk?  What do you say?  Say I'm your girlfriend.  What do you say?  Say I'm your girlfriend.  Say something.  Shut up. 
[01:53:00]  Say I'm your girlfriend.  Yeah, he was then later shot, sadly.  By Tyra's bodyguards.  How dare you?  Yeah.  Who watches her show, though?  She's obviously got a popular show.  I mean, who...  It does very well.  She made 14 million bucks last year.  It's...  I watch every day.  I mean, at least Oprah veils what a self-centered, just creep that she is.  I mean, she is a self-centered woman, but she's not as bad as Tyra.  At least she was a fatty.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Tyra is in a stratosphere all herself.  I think she needs to invite New York from I Love New York 2 on.  And she could straighten her out, I think.  No, there's no straightening her out.  No.  What else were you...  Constantly makes it about herself.  No, I think she kind of hates us.  We did that whole sign thing out there.  Fatty pig fatty.  We called her a fatty pig fatty, and it made TMZ and all that.  Oh, boy.  That was awesome.  Well, actually, it was our pest out west that did that.  She didn't laugh that off?  No.  She burned a bridge with Tyra. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  That's okay.  Very valuable bridge there.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'll try to talk to her for you guys.  All right.  What other celebs are in any kind of trouble?  Well, I guess Keeper Sutherland went into jail today or yesterday.  That's a piece of cake for him.  Yeah, people will be like...  He's high-fiving people on the way in.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to have a really good time.  He's not going to be like Paris Hilton crying after she did, what, 48 minutes.  Yeah.  This guy's going to come out like, oh, man, I bonded. 
[01:54:30]  And it's just the funniest image ever, him walking into prison.  Who high-fives is he going in?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  It's really good to have a show like 24 on where they believe you might be able to kill  them by just looking at them.  Yeah.  Just can't survive out there, man.  I'm sure he won't object to being around all those men in one room anyway.  Mm.  Yeah.  Really?  You think?  I do.  And then it was Britney's birthday this week, so thank God.  Happy birthday.  She made it to another birthday.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:55:00]  How old is she now?  26.  Why do I know this?  I don't know.  26.  And she makes $750,000 a month.  A month?  Yeah.  Doing what?  That is a good question.  Showing her clams.  From her old songs or?  Yeah.  Just from, she sold like 55 million albums.  Wow.  And you know, like when people always make fun of Paula Abdul, which we do obviously constantly  on our show.  But that woman sold 40 million albums in the late 80s. 
[01:55:30]  Paula Abdul, 40 million albums?  40 million.  E-Rock bought 30 million of them.  Yeah.  He's in love with her.  Joel, one of our guys loves Paula Abdul.  Really?  Yeah.  That's sad, isn't it?  Well, it's great that you have a diverse staff.  Yeah.  Exactly.  What do you mean he loves Paula?  E-Rock, comment.  You're on with Joel McHale from The Soup on E.  I find her rather attractive.  Oh, my God.  And what's your favorite song?  Is it that Push Push song? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Is it the one where she's dancing with the cartoon cat?  That's two steps forward.  MC Scat Cat?  Yeah.  MC Scat Cat.  What's your favorite Paula Abdul song?  Two Cats, One Cup.  What?  Opposites what?  Opposites attract.  This is it right here, Joel.  This is his favorite Paula Abdul song.  By the way, Eric, if this is your wedding song, I'll set the entrances on fire.  Oh, yeah.  Old school rap. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  I could almost see her flipping her hair back and trying to look sexy.  I need to go grab my generic sweatshirt.  This is awesome.  Hey, Joel, on The Soup, you doing anything on Two Girls, One Cup?  We tried to tell a joke this week about it, but the network was not in there.  Are you kidding?  Come on.  I know that it's a stocking stuffer for my family. 
[01:57:00]  Of course, TVD.  Yeah.  I love the YouTube.  Did you see the one with Kermit the Frog?  It is watching Two Girls, One Cup?  No.  Go on YouTube and type in Two Girls, One Cup and Kermit, and it is great.  Oh, okay.  Because we've been making our own reaction shots with the various people that come into  the studio, and a lot of them are up on YouTube.  Comedians, Bob Kelly.  We had Dennis Leary watching it the other day.  How did he do? 
[01:57:30]  He did okay, but he didn't freak out, but he couldn't watch.  He had to keep turning his head away.  Hey, do we got the audio?  Oh, we can't do it that way, of course.  Why would we?  Why would we be able to do it?  Why would we be able to be spontaneous?  You guys pulled up that tyrant clip faster than we've ever pulled a clip up on the suit  ever.  Well, because we're on the tyrant thing.  Hey, Joel, what was the joke that you couldn't do?  Well, it was just a setup to a joke.  I mean, you know, we forget.  You know, in the thousands. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah, of course.  It was just in the setup.  You know, I think we wanted to say three girls, one cup as introducing a girls next  door clip or something like that.  Oh, all right.  So it wasn't.  Why'd they say no?  I don't know.  Could be the fact that it.  I guess we could.  Video where.  We don't agree with it, but I guess we could see why the network would say no to that.  Hey, Joel, we got to take a break here.  So it's the soup on E. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, and then we're doing a special on Monday.  You'll see a best of the daytime, worst daytime show moments ever.  You're all over the view, obviously, right?  Oh, yeah.  Sherry.  We love Sherry.  Yeah, we love her here.  She knocks it out of the park about once a month.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, Joel.  Always a pleasure.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  Good luck, man.  Yes, thank you so much for having me.  All right.  It's Joel McHale from The Soup on E.  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing with all the shows now.  They have so many awful ones.  It's kind of much just love watching television. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, well, a while back, they only did things like Springer and stuff like that, those talk  shows.  Yeah.  Like talk soup.  It was just talk shows.  Now they take it from everything.  Soap operas, and they're really goofing on it.  They do a good job.  They're smart.  Pop culture.  He does a great job.  He's one of the best hosts out there.  He is funny.  I was watching the Carson Daly show last night, and they're just doing shows even though they  don't have writers, and it was brutal.  He was literally just sitting there going, all right, what have we got next?  They were bringing out people from their staff with hidden talents.  One guy could say the alphabet really quickly backwards. 
[01:59:30]  Carson Daly with writers?  It's brutal.  I can only imagine.  You got to watch it.  I hate that show.  I know it's Roland's Boy, but I hate that show.  I saw somebody could come out who could clap with one hand.  Really?  I like that.  That's cute.  No, you don't.  Sure I do.  You can clap and hold your beverage at the same time.  No, you don't.  Yeah, but Carson was actually funny.  He was going like, this is what we've come to.  Well, at least he's acknowledging it.  But see, now he has an excuse why the show's bad.  So he's jumping on that, if you know what I mean. 
[02:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Bill Burr, Carolines, tonight through the weekend.  A couple things to remember.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got Jim Norton doing his New Year's Eve show.  Let's get those tickets bought, people.  It's going to be a great night.  North Fork Theater in Westbury, Long Island.  I added a show at the Borgata, too.  Tickets on sale tomorrow, 10 a.m., for the final show at the Borgata.  And then we got Bill Burr in the studio today before he goes back to L.A.  We kind of miss Bill.  We don't get to see him as often as we used to. 
[02:00:30]  He's playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York City.  Nice.  Keep that in mind, okay?  Nice.  We got to do football picks and half the stuff we want to do, we didn't get to, unfortunately.  But I think we did all right today.  That's fun.  We got a woman that poured hot grease on her sleeping husband.  We got a teacher falling down drunk in class.  What do you want to do?  Why the hot grease?  What do they do wrong?  See?  Let's start with the violence and then we'll go to the slapstick.  All right.  Yeah.  And then we got...  Slapstick.  Oh, so then... 
[02:01:00]  All right.  And then...  I was going to make a dumb show.  Same thought I had, believe it.  You did, right?  And then it didn't work in your head and you were...  Yeah.  Right?  Okay, good.  What do the Jews have to do with this, right?  Yeah.  And then Tyra Banks has Alicia Keys on and decides to perform a freestyle poem for her.  If we want to...  Oh, my God.  ...continue with Tyra.  But first, why don't we do the grease?  Jimmy, you want that?  I think so, yeah.  Okay.  Here's the story. 
[02:01:30]  24-year-old Tanisha Young sits in a jail cell following a heated argument with her husband overnight.  Investigators say what happened next in their Tampa home is what led to her arrest.  Maybe you could lose the news advice.  What happened overnight?  Who talks like that?  Nobody.  Gotta make sure I have good tone for this story.  Oh.  Can we hear this dude again?  The sleepy village.  I think if some dude just went on the news with his regular delivery, I think he would be a huge star in local news. 
[02:02:00]  I really don't know.  No.  But instead, you're going to get this guy.  ...is what led to her arrest.  After the argument, the husband went, laid down in a chair, eventually fell asleep, and he unfortunately woke up to find his wife pouring hot grease all over him.  29-year-old Antone Neely suffered burns.  29-year-old?  Oh, my God.  Antone Neely suffered burns.  What you got to do is talk without moving your tongue.  Try to help. 
[02:02:30]  And plug your nose up completely.  But don't move that tongue at all when you're doing their story.  But why does anyone think that sounds better?  Nobody talks like this.  Exactly.  I'm a commodity.  Most people view a lazy boy as a safe haven.  What happened next?  Horrifying everybody involved.  Call the oil.  That's the hacky way.  You always got to say how this is really usually peaceful.  Yeah.  And now it's terrifying.  What I love about these stories, I think we got this in people's heads. 
[02:03:00]  When you hear these horrific stories, we go back thinking, what was the wedding song?  You know, it was a nice wedding with some kind of Celine Dion song or some song about butterflies flying.  I don't know.  And then it ends in this horrific incident where the guy's just trying to, you know, take a nap.  And he's awoken by hot grease all over his face.  Hot grease being poured on him.  Above ground pools are usually refreshing.  Refreshing.  A place to relax with a hot sun. 
[02:03:30]  What happened now?  Horrified.  Turned to horror.  Horrified everybody involved.  Shocked, even experienced above ground poolers.  And he unfortunately woke up to find his wife pouring hot grease all over him.  29-year-old Antone Neely suffered burns over his arm, legs, and upper body.  Doctors who treat those type of injuries say grease burns can be very painful.  Really?  Wow. 
[02:04:00]  Doctors that treat them.  Not just anybody.  Are they more painful than boiling water?  Let's start there.  Did this idiot actually throw that into the news story that grease burns are painful?  Are painful.  Just in case you didn't know.  Right.  Because you might go, grease burn.  What the hell is that?  God, they're just incompetent.  They're incompetent.  Meanwhile...  He's an open microchip.  Cut him some slack.  He's an open microchip.  No.  Nine black kids beat up a white lady on a...  And it's nowhere to be found.  They won't come to that story accurately.  But this one is all...  You know, the grease is painful according to experts. 
[02:04:30]  According to experts that deal with that type of thing.  ...burns over his arm, legs, and upper body.  Doctors who treat those type of injuries say, grease burns can be very painful.  The part that makes it even worse is the fact that it's mostly second degree burns, which means not all the...  Yeah, I don't even...  I can't even think of a time where it wouldn't be painful.  It's not painful.  Right.  They're always painful.  Maybe if you're a paraplegic, it's not that painful.  It's on your leg.  You're just like, eh.  Oh, can someone clean this up? 
[02:05:00]  Everybody's an idiot.  Even the other guy describes, after eating dinner, he laid down in a chair.  It's like, really?  How do you do that?  Yeah.  So still there are nerve endings in the skin, so you just have a lot of pain.  Oh, really?  Dressing changes are painful.  Oh.  And it's still going to require skin grafts.  Now I get it.  Police eventually found Young hiding in a closet at her mother's house.  She's been arrested and currently is charged with aggravated battery domestic violence.  In the meantime, her husband is listed in good condition and is being treated for his burns. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, really?  I thought they weren't going to treat this guy.  I said, ah!  Ah, it's just grease burns.  Yeah, just lay there.  What?  Usually hiding in a closet is a game.  But things got a little too serious.  Well, this wasn't a game of hide and seek.  Hot grease can make things people enjoy.  French fries, potato chips, bacon.  But this time, if bacon...  Well, this was no laughing mug.  This grease was not poured in a jar. 
[02:06:00]  It was poured on his unit.  God, that was a horrible news story.  It was just terribly done.  Of course.  Worthless information.  They should have doctored on all those nerve endings and that's what causes...  He's explaining why fire hurts.  And it didn't even seem like the guy...  Cavemen know that.  It didn't even seem like at the end of the day there was a lot of grease or he even got  burned that bad because there was no, you know, second and third degree burns.  It's like, evidently, grease can hurt. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She fried up some bacon and he got caught cheating on her and she threw it on the face.  He splashed it.  It's not like a whole big vat of it being poured on his face.  There's nothing left but a skull sitting in the chair.  He actually gets a mystery like mint jelly was dumped on the guy's chest and now that burns.  That's an explanation I'd like to hear.  If you were pouring, like, burning grease on...  Wow.  Look what Holly Hunter did to herself.  Got shot like Mary Jo but a few go.  Oh, my God.  That's called freaking face work.  She doesn't even...  She's like Bonnie Raitt. 
[02:07:00]  Anyway, that's a visual.  Hey, we got Paul.  Paul checking in.  Paul.  Hey.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  You mentioned at the beginning when they used the article, they said they got involved  in a heated argument.  This couple got involved in a heated argument.  That ended with grease being pulled.  Literally heated argument.  Where would you go with the grease?  Things got a little too hot.  She was hot under the collar and then made her husband the same.  With hot grease.  Hey, speaking of useless information, going off what Jimmy said. 
[02:07:30]  Or worthless information, yes.  It's time for the football picks.  Ooh.  Ah.  It's worthless information.  This is who gives a crap stuff.  I like football, though.  I'm losing.  Horribly.  Who's the big winner?  For most people, football is enjoyable.  I like the sponsor, though.  Dish Network.  Of course.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  I like them.  To Daryl Stingley, it wasn't.  All right.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:08:00]  My brother's back.  Jimmy going back 30 years.  Yeah.  My brother's doing the football picks for me this week.  And he writes, I'm still making the right choices, but it's amazing what little luck have befallen me.  Overtime losses, injuries, you name it.  Oof.  It's almost coin-flipping time, to tell you the truth.  Ah, see.  He's losing hope.  He's losing faith in himself.  He writes, Giants over the Eagles this week.  How the Giants keep winning is beyond me.  Game in and game out.  Eli looks like someone I wouldn't even trust in a family Nerf game on a sunny Easter Sunday. 
[02:08:30]  But somehow they keep winning.  The answer is the Giants, D.  He also picks the Chargers over the Titans.  Tough game here.  Who's going to show up for the Chargers is anybody's guess.  Jekyll or Hyde.  But they have the horses to win this one.  The what?  Horses.  Yes.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[02:09:00]  Brother Elmo will be appearing at FH Riley's tonight and tomorrow night, by the way.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers over the Texans.  Garcia should be back and giving the Texans the old two-step, dancing around their rushers  and finding receivers.  Boo.  Boo.  He takes your Cowboys this week there, Jimmy, over the Lions.  Kitna should take every snap lying on his back to save the D some time.  He's going to be hounded by the Cowboys all the live long day. 
[02:09:30]  Boo.  Uh-oh.  The kiss of death.  I am again predicting a good day for the state of Ohio.  Good afternoon to Cleveland, by the way.  Bengals over the Rams.  Tough call, but I think the Bengals will outlast the Rams in a high-flying game.  And the Browns over the Jets.  The Browns are a very possible playoff team and got ripped off on a bad call last week  that cost them the game.  Stupid zebras.  Anderson's aerial show will ground the Jets.  Boo. 
[02:10:00]  And finally, he's taking the Steelers over the Patriots.  Oh, I'm just kidding, guys.  Patriots over the Steelers.  The Steel can definitely beat the Pats, but with it being a home game, I've got to go  with New England.  I hope I'm wrong with this one.  Oh, man, he doesn't want the Pats winning this one.  Nobody does at this point, except for me.  No, I'm with you, Bill.  Everybody, I think a lot of people do.  I like a good sports story.  Me, too.  Cowboys beating them.  Shut up, Jimmy. 
[02:10:30]  Cowboys.  F America's team.  No.  Football special.  Whoa.  Football.  Football Picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  We can't play substitute teacher, Guy?  Boo.  I want to hear that.  All right, let's squeeze in.  Squeeze in.  We got a substitute teacher.  He's accused of being drunk on the job.  Nice.  You know, now that I'm older, I understand this, but I remember back in the day when, 
[02:11:00]  like, you would get a substitute teacher, and the guy didn't look quite right at the  front of the classroom.  You're like, wow, and he smells a little bad, right?  And I figured it out when I finally got into some of that drinking.  You do a little extra drinking when you know you don't have to perform the next day,  and I think with these substitute teachers, all of a sudden they get that last-minute  call.  Oh, I got to go in.  Yeah, if I went to bed three hours ago, I'm still drunk.  They get the call that morning.  Yeah, some of them seemed like they were drunk.  They get the call in the morning, because, like, the teacher has the flu or something.  So we have one of those cases.  Police say 54-year-old Mary Kaminsky fell down in her fourth-grade classroom while working 
[02:11:30]  as a substitute teacher.  The school superintendent tells CBS2, quote, it's extremely disappointing.  Clearly, this woman must have had some significant personal problems.  These news people are stoked.  Clearly, she was a drunk whore.  He sounds like that cartoon character.  Which one is it?  Oh, my God.  Is he has the same...  I don't know.  Oh, sorry.  It's sad that someone who's been teaching all her life would conduct herself in this way.  Well, I think it's probably a woman who might have had a really good record and had a horrible 
[02:12:00]  day.  Maybe something terrible happened in her life.  Officials say Kaminsky, who's been held on $50,000 bail, has been fired and banned from working  in the school district.  She also faces criminal charges of endangering the welfare of a child and possession of alcohol  on school property.  She has booze with her?  Back in the day when you could actually drink at work.  If you watch those old Mary Tyler Moores, where Lou's like, man, sit down, have a drink,  pulls out a big bottle of scotch. 
[02:12:30]  $50,000 bail.  $50,000 bail.  What do you really learn in this?  $50,000 bail.  I just want to be part of it.  She fell down.  It's ridiculous.  Poor lady fell down.  Let's hear more.  Substitute stunner in New Jersey.  A teacher accused of being drunk on the job in front of fourth graders at Manalapan Elementary  School.  CBS 2's Jay Dow live there right now with reactions.  Jay?  Reactions.  With reactions.  Who cares?  Boy, let's guess what the reaction's going to be. 
[02:13:00]  That person's an alcoholic.  They should be fired.  There you go.  End of story.  You don't need reactions.  Can't they have one guy going, man, that's pretty effed up.  It's really funny, man.  Let me guess.  You know, you trust the school system.  You send your kids.  And, you know, they got to do a better job.  My kid is traumatized.  And I'm thinking about a lawsuit.  You know, this is just really, you don't expect this around here.  We came here because it's a good school system.  Okay.  We got to wrap it up.  So what do I got there?  Jay?  Good evening. 
[02:13:30]  Education officials say Mary Kaminsky worked at the school only part-time  as a substitute and that she's actually a retired teacher who was fully certified 21 years ago.  But police say because of her actions, she's traded a classroom for a cell in the Monmouth County Jail.  News spreads fast at Manalapan's Pinebrook School.  Especially with you spreading it.  News spreads fast.  Well, you're the news spreader.  God, they're just disgusting humans. 
[02:14:00]  And trading a classroom for a cell.  That was a big buildup.  Trading a classroom.  I thought it was going to be something else.  He was proud.  For a jail rumor.  He was proud.  I bet you he wrote that himself.  Yeah.  It's Pinebrook School and everyone's talking about a substitute teacher arrested yesterday  by township police for drinking on the job.  Generally, I feel that this is a CX school.  But this hasn't been something I've heard about at all before.  Shut up, you nerd.  What?  What a dork. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, really, man.  I can see if the teacher was like, you know, pulled out a bong in class.  Yeah.  But, you know, so what?  Someone's had a few drinks.  They bring a bottle in to keep it going and she fell down.  She'd feel bad for her.  My stupid kids aren't learning anything anyway.  That's a little weirdos.  My favorite school story, but we've run out, is that principal.  Oh, yeah.  He was just despicable.  Naked in his office.  Watching gay porn.  Smoking crack.  And smoking crack.  It's one of the greatest stories we've ever done on the show.  That it's just a cry for help.  Oh, please.  Right there in his office. 
[02:15:00]  You think they busted into his office and he's like, about time.  Thank you.  I need help.  What else did I have to do?  I'm screaming over here.  My insides have been screaming for attention.  I got a text from my friend.  He sounds like the voice that says, if Woody would have gone to the police, none of this  would have happened.  Does he sound like that guy?  I'm lost.  Woody would have gone to the police.  None of this would have happened.  I don't remember what that voice was.  Does he sound like that or no? 
[02:15:30]  It's a narrator.  Yeah, a narrator voice, but I don't know what cartoon.  All right.  We'll have to listen to it.  It's plug time.  Tell your friend he didn't give enough information.  Stupid.  Bill Burr, Caroline.  Tell me.  Thanks a lot, Kim.  For nothing.  For nothing.  Thanks for humiliating me.  We got Bill Burr, Caroline's all weekend long.  Let's not forget that.  And then Jimmy's got another.  Yeah, the Borgata.  The first two shows are sold out.  So the third show for Sunday, December 20th, night before Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday  goes on sale tomorrow morning, 10 a.m., to Borgata.com.  And a huge party tonight at Bar 9. 
[02:16:00]  Of course, can't say the name of the party.  Not on this side.  Oh, really?  But it's, yeah, big party there at Bar 9 on 9th Avenue.  Will you be there, Anthony?  Of course.  Me, Ron Bennington.  It's going to be fun.  Chicks, as Ronnie would say.  Chicks.  What time's the start?  Hey, whatever you got there.  You coming by, Bill?  I got two shows tonight.  Maybe, uh...  These guys party.  These guys party.  Please.  It's going to be...  The sun will come up.  It'll still be there.  All right.  Yeah, no joke. 
[02:16:30]  And it's the real deal.  Oh, yeah.  The real deal.  It started off as an innocent party.  As an innocent party.  It ended the same.  With Anthony Cumia falling down like a substitute teacher while he was doing 80 on the LIE.  No, there won't be any driving for me this evening.  Police cards couldn't get him out of this one.  We got to go.  Go after ourselves.  Exactly.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:00]  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.

[02:20:30]  And here we are.  And here we are.  And here we are.  And here we are. 
[02:21:00]  We play that version today  because Metallica  nominated for a Grammy  Best Rock Instrumental  for their version of  Ecstasy of Gold.  There you go.  There you go.  And we're all broadcasting  with our coats on.  Yeah, for some reason  it's cold in here.  Not me, not Bill.  What?  Not me and not Bill.  Well, you're hugging each other.  So what?  For the whole show.  I hug you from the back.  He hugs me from the back.  We switch.  Called equal. 
[02:21:30]  It's called bonding.  Yeah.  Bonding.  I'm holding him.  Gently rocking.  Gently rocking.  Caressing.  Stroking his smooth head.  We got to start with the tire clip we mentioned.  Tyra Banks has Alicia on  and decides to perform a freestyle poem for her.  Oh.  Freestyle poem.  We mentioned this and the boys got it for us  during the two shows.  So why don't we play this?  Please tell me the opening line is  Thank God you're here. 
[02:22:00]  I thought you'd be on a hunt.  Yeah, probably not.  No?  I like it.  Freestyling.  Yeah.  Kind of anticipate what's coming.  And so, you know, you don't know exactly.  Let me braid your.  Oh my God.  How do you do this thing?  Alicia Keys is gorgeous,  but she has like that really like dude kind of voice.  Remember that song she came out with  and in the middle of it  she was like supposed to be calling the guy  and supposed to be sexy  and it's just like  Yo, I was seeing you in a diner. 
[02:22:30]  He's just like, wow.  It's coming out of you.  That beautiful face.  She really is a pretty  but her body's a little fucked up.  I think she's gorgeous  but she really looks like she could choke you out  with the second she starts talking.  Yeah, yeah.  You know she knows how to do a few of those.  Gang signs?  Throwing up some gang signs?  Here it is.  And so, you know,  you don't know exactly.  And so I was like, wow,  she's really sweet.  This is nice to speak to someone  that's really so sweet like that.  Can I express myself poetically right now? 
[02:23:00]  Write me a poem.  How?  Okay.  Okay.  Are they sick of this shit?  It's obviously not off the cuff by the way.  She obviously planned it.  I would look like  Alicia must have just had a look of horror on her face like  Alicia's getting into some shit  and then Tyra,  can I express myself?  You express yourself  during the entire show?  It's always about her.  Somebody stole our presents  when we were eight.  Okay.  Can I express myself now?  Right, right, right.  Can I just get into me?  And so I was like,  wow, she's really sweet. 
[02:23:30]  This is nice.  It's cool.  To speak to someone  that's really so sweet like that.  Can I express myself poetically right now?  Write me a poem.  How?  Okay.  Okay.  How I felt that day.  She's one of those people.  All the way to how I feel now.  Alicia,  I must tell you  that when I met you  at  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I thought that you were the shiznit  and thought that we would have 
[02:24:00]  a friendship family  Me, me, you, and Kimora Lee  But my dreams of sisterhood  Got squashed down  And I felt like a victim  in the movie  Boys in the Hood  But as I sit here  with you on my couch  End it  What rhymes with couch?  Cunt  I'm not feeling any pain  All the pain is gone 
[02:24:30]  No more  Ouch  There you go  Here you go  Maybe you can be my plan  For the air  Goddamn rich cunt  Goddamn rich cunt  Like you rich cunt  You know what I like  before she went into it  It was like  You know when somebody's  not listening to you  like their reaction  doesn't make sense  to what you  You're talking about  something horrific  and they go  Oh that's cool  So anyway  they just launch into their shit  That's exactly what happened 
[02:25:00]  What the fuck was that?  And then I was burned  over three quarters of my body  That's neat  No no  No  You're actually leading  to exactly what we want to do  Tyra did a show  where she helps sick kids  and then is able to turn that around  to talk about what happened  No way  Yes  How could she turn that?  Maybe she also has  bad genetics  Nothing  This is the ultimate  of her making it  about herself  Constantly 
[02:25:30]  Constantly  And if I knew  how to work  these fucking CD players  we'd have it on the air  for everybody  It's fine  Don't embarrass the boss  Oh then you do that  Great  Alright  So Tyra did a show  on helping sick kids  This first clip  Tyra has good advice  for a girl being picked on  for having cancer  So this girl's on the show  She's got cancer  Mina kids  Oh the worst  What are you going to die?  Oh god  Oh god  I mean what are you saying 
[02:26:00]  How do you pick on someone  with cancer?  That's the only way to go  Ha ha  Your hair's falling out  Yeah  Nice wig  Are you going to cry?  Nice wig  Faggot  Right  Kids are brutal  Next year we're in 5th grade  and you're in the ground  Oh  Oh yeah  I mean what else  are you going to say?  I know  Where do you go with that?  Where's Cosby and kids  say the darndest things  with this fucking topic  I don't know  So  this kid has cancer  picked on in school  He wants some pudding 
[02:26:30]  for lunch  or are you just going to  eat what's between your ears?  Fucking rotten children are  Listen  I like how we're making the jokes  and then blaming it  on the kids  Of course we're on the kids  The beauty of us  That's right  We're brilliant broadcasters  This is how they describe  the clip here  I believe this would be Sam  Tyra has good advice  for a girl being picked on  for having cancer  because  Tyra  was a cruel kid  and was picked on  Ah  Tyra was picked on 
[02:27:00]  for being beautiful  Wow  For being what  tall  and lanky  and heading toward  a multi-million dollar  modeling career  Just like cancer  I mean didn't she make it  when she was like 16?  Yeah  Like how much struggling  did you do?  She struggled between  probably 13 and 15  That's tough  Pretty much everyone  struggles during that time  She'd been picked off  for wearing a fucking  horsetail on her head  Stinks  I love how we're in here  like we're at  fucking Mount Everest 
[02:27:30]  climb  I know  This is where  we're at base camp one  I think I'm good now  Are you good?

[02:28:30]  Wow  and another thing  that I'm struggling with  is the kids at school  are really horrible  about like accepting me  with my cancer  and things like that  What do they say  do they say stuff  to you at school  Yeah like um  in the sixth grade  when I was diagnosed  on April Fool's Day  Uh-huh  A couple kids  in my class  wrote can't  um  cancer can kill you  on the wall  and stuff like that  and like scream cancer  in my face  and things like that  Jesus  You know what I would do  because kids are so cruel  They scream cancer  I've been a cruel kid  and I've been made fun of  I've been on both sides 
[02:29:00]  and I think it's important  to tell them  that this really hurts me  Alright  Okay  What about you?  Yeah kids understand that  Oh my god  Yeah okay  Kids understand that  Hey I just wanna  Hey I just wanna  Cancer  Yeah cancer face  Basically she's going  I want  Yeah I wanna let you know  that you're getting to me  That's Tyra's advice  Let them know  that they're getting to you  What the fuck  Fucking idiot  I mean I was a funny kid  but what kind of kid  runs up and just yells  Cancer  And runs away 
[02:29:30]  What a hack  What is that?  All of them  Yeah  They're horrific  They're just bastards  Dude you hit it  You said it earlier  They should have the kids  say the darndest things  and actually show  the real mean shit  Yeah the real darn things  they're saying  By the way  we're really distracted  because Maury  Look at this  Look at the shot  of this kid  Look at the angle  Maury's doing these  camera angles  They have fat kids  It's the fat kids show  With little  with little baby halter tops  They have little halter tops  on these kids 
[02:30:00]  that are like  three years old  They give them  little shorts  They give them  mozzarella sticks  to eat  And they give them  like hot dogs  and mozzarella sticks  They have the little thing  walking down the hall  Cupcakes  Look at that  Walking toward the set  Pizza  And they have a camera angle  They got the camera  obviously shooting  from the floor up  so it looks like  there's big monsters  coming at you  Big gut  in slow motion  But you look at  the mother's a fat cunt  Look at this shot  Look at this shot  She's leaning with her belly  She's four years old  This woman has five kids 
[02:30:30]  and between them  they weigh 450 pounds  Can we once have a fat kid  with a mother who's human?  This is Gilbert Grape's mother  She's disgraceful  I love the fact that  Maury doesn't give a shit  Why aren't those kids  taken away  I know  That is worse  than other kinds of abuses  that they do take kids away for  Look at that monster of a mother  She's wider than  like three seats  Maury could put together 
[02:31:00]  three seats  and that fucking ass  would still hang out  over the edge  What do they got her eating?  The baby sister is four  and she weighs on her butt  That kid's hysterical  He looks like  Ungabunga Vingabunga  from Bugs Bunny  Yeah, they have like  man tits  at four  Look at that kid  He's got like  Was it the Junkyard Dog?  You guys ever used to watch wrestling?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  S.D. Jones  Wow

[02:32:00]  Where their fucking  wrestling shorts  were up to their nipples  But then it barely covered  below their ball pegs  Yeah  Then they had tights  underneath it  in those hooker boots  Bulldog Brower  Ivan Putsky  The Polish Hammer  Polish Power, yeah  I can't believe  that this fat pig  of a mother  Pat Patterson  Holy shit  Is allowed to do this  to her kids  Yeah  You're a fat little fucker  aren't you?  I'm going to see Maury  be completely honest 
[02:32:30]  with these kids  How about we do this?  The guys are going to get  some audio clips  from the Maury Fat Kid show  and we'll continue  with Tyra helping sick kids  Yeah  Because the next clip  we got here  Tyra plugs  America's Next Top Model  her other show  that is all about her  while talking to a girl  with lupus  then asks when was  the first time  she saw her father cry  Good lord  So Camille  I know  you have  you're diagnosed with lupus  Yes  And do you know  of an America's Next Top Model  that has lupus too?  Yes I have  Who's that? 
[02:33:00]  She's cross promoting it  With a disease  Exactly  She had lupus  and she had some struggles  but she really persevered  and she fought through  Yeah  And I know that  you said that you saw  your dad cry for the first time  Why was that?  Holy shit  Why?  Basically she's saying  in that clip  So look  get over your stupid lupus  Okay  And she was cross promoting  using a disease  Yeah  That's wonderful  So at some point  somebody had to make  the decision  well  what was wrong  with that chick 
[02:33:30]  on the  the model show  if we could just  somehow get a kid  with the same  fucked up disease  Yeah  This next clip  is great  Tyra mentions  that a girl  with sickle cell  was picked on  just like she was  This isn't  comforting people  Does she understand  this isn't  comforting people  when she tries  to relate  by telling people  how beautiful  she was  and how hard  it was  growing up like that  She thinks  like people  really look up  to her  like she's 
[02:34:00]  this goddess  Yeah  And if she can  just somehow  say that  on any level  she had some  sort of difficulty  Yeah  It's equal  to the horrific  situations  that people  It's just  So she's got  no sense  of reality  And then the  final clip  because I don't  want anyone  turning their  channel off here  Tyra asks a girl  with sickle cell  to talk about  how excited she was  to meet Tyra  Tyra is trying  to remove herself  from a pedestal  that no one  has her on  Yeah 
[02:34:30]  Right  Here we go  And then  Henrisha  I know you  you looked  up to me  because you  got teased  you get teased  teased for  being long  and skinny  Yeah  And I got  teased a lot  too  You have sickle  cell anemia  don't you  Yes  Yeah  And they used  to tease me  about that  because I have  yellow eyes  sister  Oh  Come here  Wait let me see  I think your eyes  are beautiful  No you don't  I remember when 
[02:35:00]  I got a yellow  diamond  We're doing a  swimsuit shoot  What an ass  Wait let me see  I think your eyes  are beautiful  I have this  camp for young  girl  Maratu  Exactly  And Ron Chaney  junior eyes  No one thinks  yellow eyes  are beautiful  That's why  it's a sign  of illness  Yeah why don't  you do a poem  about that 
[02:35:30]  Tyra  They sell  They sell color  contacts  in blue  and green  and brown  They don't  sell yellow  Why  Because you  look sickly  Sick  Oh come here  Wait let me see  I think your eyes  are beautiful  I have this  camp for young  girls called  T-Zone  And there  is this one  girl and she  used to cry  about her eyes  but to me her  eyes were so  beautiful and I  love that your  eyes are like big  and almond  shaped and they  kind of slant up  on the sides  like that  That's pretty  Yes just the 
[02:36:00]  color is repugnant  to all who  walk here  She also cross  promoted her  little camp  Yeah her camp  had to get in  there  What is sickle  cell by the way  I don't even  know what it  is  Your red blood  cells which are  supposed to be  very round and  smooth so they  can slide past  each other take  on a more sickle  shape Jimmy  Oh sickle cell  And then they can't  move through the  arteries and veins  as efficiently as  red blood cells  So what's it do  to you  clod up  Okay  It kind of gets 
[02:36:30]  stuck and clod up  How do you know  that  Well being Sicilian  you know  That's true  Teasing of course  I just kind of  knew it  Linger Linger  Forget Aristotle  and fuck Socrates  Here comes  Professor Anthony  God I forgot  that fucking  We haven't played  that in a long time  Hated theme song  How come  Can you cure it  No  It's treatable  but it's not curable  How do you get it  African Americans 
[02:37:00]  get it  Only why though  How come white people  I don't know  It's one of those  things they say  we're all you know  the same under  inside but we're  really not  It's just  the habit  Do white people  get it  Very rare cases  of people that  aren't African American  but I think  they'd probably  look back  and their family  treat something  happened you know  back way back  I'd hate to have  my cell shit  like a sickle  That would be awful  What do they do  to treat it  Blood thinners  and then things  to lubricate  the cells  so they slide  past each other  easier  Yeah  God it's amazing 
[02:37:30]  how about  sickle load anemia  I wouldn't mind that  a girl's trying to  pick my fucking  cum out of her hair  and it's fucking  yanking the roots  little sickles  It tears the skin  off her back  It's like swallowing  glass  Shooting nails  Yeah  Take some fucking  sickle seeds  right in your mouth  Cockpiece  Sickle seed anemia  Hey uh  I liked how uh  What's his name  handled it on um  in a full  full metal jacket

Bravo  The fucking audience  and it's a big audience  today  They came out  in this cold weather  to do the walkover  which we couldn't do  because of some  fucking equipment problem  I don't know  I forgot it again 
[02:44:30]  They filled up the bleachers  They're standing room only  They're sitting there  bored shitless  as we're playing  fucking  who gives a shit  stuff for the last  ten minutes  And then  as we're getting ready  to go back in the air  Jimmy and I  watched  half the  half the audience  just march off  Yeah why  Why did half  have to go?  Like why can't this  be done on an  individual basis?  How about you do it  during the boring  commercial shit?  Do you want to talk  Poe?  Yes  Oh my god  Well he doesn't even  know that we're

The whole reason  they're here  is to watch  the show  Yes I know  but we're trying  to do the paperwork  as quickly as possible  Why not doing it  while they sit there  doing the commercials?  We did  We had to make copies  We were watching  They were bored  like doing this  with their thumbs  bored  waiting for us  to come back  and we're just  about to come back  and Anthony  actually pointed out 
[02:45:30]  Wow Poe  just pie-pipered  everybody to another  part of the building  to the bleachers  Sorry guys  Can't it be done  individually?  Like one person  at a time  or handing the papers  and have them  fill it out  like a fucking  motor vehicle  or something?  They are filling it  out individually  Where?

[02:54:00]  sent me a text  and it said  it said  I had a talk  with Than  because he noticed  that Than  had thrown a little  jab  a little bash  at me  on that day's  show  so he had  had a talk  with Than  about this  that it  wasn't  appropriate  for him  to chime  in and  give a jab  to the  on air  staff  as they are  doing the  show  and then he  texts me  with that  information  then says  if  you didn't 
[02:54:30]  mind this  I'm sorry  and that  was pretty  much it  and then  I'm thinking  why wouldn't  he ask me  first if it  bothered me  and then  if it did  have the  talk with  Than  so I  then  had to  text Than  with this  long apology  of oh my  god I  didn't  because then  all I'm  thinking is  you had the  talk with  Than  and Than  thinks I'm  the biggest  fucking  douchebag  to go to  Steve and  go Steve  tell Than  that I 
[02:55:00]  didn't  appreciate  what he  said  that's  not at  all  that isn't  exalted  at all  what it  was  I can't  remember  who  mentioned  it  but somebody  said in  the studio  and I  would mention  it if I  could remember  who it was  that you  flashed in  like some  kind of  mean look  after he  did it  and that's  why I  pulled Than  aside  and said  maybe you  shouldn't  have done  that  I don't  know if  he got  mad at  you  but maybe  you  shouldn't  have done  that  and then  afterwards  I  thought  let me  check  and that's  what I  texted you  and said 
[02:55:30]  I talked  to Than  about bashing  you on  air  if it  was a  mistake  then I  apologize  how did  that  conversation  go  you should  have  milked  this  do you  know how  great  that would  have been  you should  have written  back and said  yeah dude  that was  just it  wasn't cool  let me tell you  something  I couldn't  just the time  in between  the talk  that Steve  had with  Than  about this  and me  finally texting  Than  and him  getting back  to me  that he  got the  text  I was  just  thinking  it was  killing me  to think  that Than  thought I  was a  douchebag  that would  get pissed  at something  like that  I was kind 
[02:56:00]  of freaking  out  and I  told Than  I go  it's  open  game  I go  I have  no  problem  with  anything  Than  would  say  he's  a clever  enough  guy  that he's  not  going  to  blurt  something  stupid  out  that's  just  hurtful  he does  it  in jest  like  everybody  else  does  here  what  was  the  talk  like  that's  what  I  was  curious  about  every  other  talk  probably  I 
[02:56:30]  blow  blow  everybody's  brains  out  in front  of  everybody  else  what  a  disciplinarian  you are  I'll  suck  your  cock  till  you're  stupid  I  say  dumb  things  was it  uncomfortable  for you  Than  because I  could only  imagine  yeah I  mean it'd  be  just like 
[02:57:00]  somebody  telling me  that sky  was red  or something  it was the  complete opposite  of what  I thought  yeah Than  writes me  back and  says  you know  I thought  I thought  I didn't  know how  to read  a room  or you  know  a person  or something  like that  which you  kind of  pride yourself  on being  in comedy  and on the  air you  kind of  gotta know  how to  read the  room and  if you  could jump  on somebody  or not  and then  Steve just  fucking takes  your confidence  away  I think I  tend to be  protective of  everybody  and that's 
[02:57:30]  shut the  fuck up  you're not  protective of me  he's rejecting  your love  Dan's gonna  have a talk  with me now  it's alright  if I wasn't  that might have  bothered me  more importantly  more importantly  it's been brought  to my attention  that you do  a new character  which one  asshole who  doesn't  isn't perceptive  guy  no that's always  a character  I'm doing  can't take a joke  guy  can't take a joke  asshole who  isn't perceptive  I think Sam  will help us out

[03:05:00]  reporter Zach Wheeler  tells us flatulence  may have started  this shooting rampage  well that's right  Jeff  witnesses told  to Monk County  Sheriff's deputies  why they think  32 year old  William Hoover  pulled out an assault  rifle last night  they say it all started  because the suspect  passed gas  now deputies say  William Hoover  started arguing  with three people  in Wheeler's  beverage store  after six o'clock  last night  they say  the argument  moved outside  and turned physical  that's when deputies 
[03:05:30]  say Hoover  ran to his car  pulled out  a semi-automatic rifle  and shot  at the three  nobody was hurt  an investigator  says the three people  claim Hoover  passed gas  and could not take  the teasing  that's pretty tough  for just  oh jeez

[03:06:30]  possibly took place  over  some comments  made about  the suspect's  body odor  which  led to  the  defendant  suspect  becoming extremely  irate  over these comments  they were simple  verbal comments  which  uh...  verbal  is apparently  he  did not take  too well  and sheriff's deputies  say Hoover admits  the three victims  were teasing him  about farting  he's  behind bars  at the Shimon County 
[03:07:00]  jail  deputies say Hoover  had been drinking  but they don't know  if he was drunk  and Jeff employees  at Wheeler's  beverage store  would not comment  about the incident  today  the victims  also have requested  they not be identified  due to fear  of retaliation  jimmy would have  been like  shot  800 times  no i didn't  make the  no the guy  who cut the  fart actually  did the shooting  which is just  a double whammy  he cuts a gasser 
[03:07:30]  and stinks  the place up  and then shoots  and tease him  about it  there's some  chelsea grammar  ah  this is  look at him  looking so  he's got one  hand in his pocket  what the hell  was that  commercial  looked like  that guy  that's the  other thing  the other thing  through it's a  small world  pretending i was  a u.n.  interpreter  i think i'm  wow  that was  really  really bad

[03:09:30]  expecting right  there  that was all right  my comment on it  got a zero too  so there's something  in the air all of a  sudden  yeah it's just  awful this  yeah just bombing  i think we need  more on a scat  guy to pull this  one out  yeah  or new german  guy but he's  nowhere to be  found in steve's  head  yeah he's still  looking for uh  for that guy  he's probably in  there in a closet  somewhere  well of course he  is but  where is it  well we got a  great little story  that happened in a  funeral home  we'll play a little  mop up today  fight breaks out  as man tries to 
[03:10:00]  raise dead at  funeral  the chaos at the  casket started  with a misunderstanding  in the eyes of the  pastor  he raised his hand  and said  in the name of  the lord jesus  rise up and  walk  pastor glendy  hamilton believes  timothy cleary  seen smiling here  in his mugshot  was only trying to  help an 18 year  old murder victim  he wanted to  raise him from  the dead  yeah so we  wanted to raise  him from the  dead  so is that what 
[03:10:30]  i'm being  rise up and  walk and the  guy got up  as the  wow  jesus jimmy  i was gonna say  he had a fight  because the dead  guy got up and  hit him  i was gonna say  see i took the  glasses off that's  the problem the  glasses just made  me an unfunny  faggot  apparently but  with them  you guys like  jimmy's glasses  thank you 
[03:11:00]  thank you  you don't like  them sir  thank you  all right here's  the second half of  the story so the  guy's trying to  raise the dead  basically  but the family  of zarek harrison  who was found  shot and killed  over the weekend  saw something  different  just start  smashing the  boy's face  in the  thing  and saying  the name  of jesus  and that  would start  the whole fight  hamilton says  in the crowd  of 200 mourners  as many as  30 people  ran to tackle  cleary  hitting him  and kicking  him until  police  interfered 
[03:11:30]  in the  commotion  the pastor  says  two people  fainted  requiring  medical  attention  but outside  the mob  continued  smashing  each window  on cleary's  car  it was there  we found  this motivational  message  to the dashboard  reading  i always do  everything i need  to do  police eventually  dispersed the crowd  and arrested  cleary for disturbing  a religious assembly  have you ever seen  anything like this  before  never  never  never  not even  on television  i've seen  the cops  knocking the 
[03:12:00]  truck window  out  and i thought  they was giving  the man  ups  i thought  the man  was dead  that's the way  it was  ups  the best clip  ever  ever  i thought  they were  giving  the man  ups  she's making  mistakes  although this  woman's  great too  that aired  on the news  they couldn't 
[03:12:30]  understand what  she was saying  and she said  kicking him in  the balls  i love that  kicking him  in the balls  can you imagine  being trampled  to death  how much  that would suck  worse ways  to go  you would get  used to it  after a while  you're probably  so distracted  by the trampling

[03:20:30]  oh is that  it  yeah  there's a  whole big  bunch of  things happening  it's like  doing a  line  remotes  that's good  alright here  we go  humans to  marry robots  by 2050  oh I don't  believe it  the future  we were also  supposed to get  the water  powered car  yeah  that didn't  work out too  well for  anybody  especially for  Stan  poor Stan  I was thinking  about Stan  like last night  a couple of  times  that made me  laugh  all night long  like wow  that's really  a drag  the guy  killed himself  by just 
[03:21:00]  opening his  mouth  poor Stan  he's gotta  keep his  mouth shut  next time  all excited  that the  military  was and the  government  was all  psyched about  his invention  flying out to  check out the  invention in person  and he didn't  make sure it  works  that he probably  that lieutenant  colonel probably  like got to a  secure line and  went like holy  shit it works  it actually works  alright you know  what to do  you know  kill him  let's go with the  poison thing  make this problem  go away  and Stan  no red flags  were you know  popping up 
[03:21:30]  with poor Stan  how long after  was he poisoned  do we know  three years  one meal later  it was 95  it wasn't 98  I was actually  talking to Danny  95 was the clip  and in 98  they took him  out  he went to a  ground round  got the potato  skins  I don't know  where he went  but you know  it would be  something like that  I would love  to know the  details of his  poisoning  why'd they wait  were they  monitoring him  the whole time  they probably  wanted to see  they actually  wanted the  technology I bet  Danny 
[03:22:00]  got a little  something on this  on poor Stan  sort of  I was trying to  read up on him  a little bit more  today and  apparently he was  eating at this  small restaurant  in his hometown  and just in the  middle of dinner  just stood up  and just shouted  they poisoned me  they poisoned me  and he ran out  and he collapsed  in the parking lot  dead  he even said  they poisoned me  oh he was probably  feeling it like  oh fuck  I mean you know  we gotta play this  news  they obviously  didn't poison him  there  some of the reports  say that it was  an aneurysm  had nothing to do  with poisoning  and then obviously  the conspiracy 
[03:22:30]  theorists  say that it was  poisoning  you know what  conspiracy theorists  always seem a little  nuts to me  like the first  three quarters  I believe  but on this one  he's basically  hey I discovered  a free way  to fuck over  the top 1%  of rich people  in the world  come on over  to my house  come on and  check it out  in case you  weren't listening  yesterday  we love this thing  we gotta do it again  the top  our news  here at 6 o'clock  an age old dream  becoming a reality 
[03:23:00]  a local inventor  has discovered  a way  hear this  to use water  to run your car  it's a major  breakthrough  that will no doubt  make motorists happy  and as Ralph Robinson  explains  the pentagon  is also showing  lots of interest  in this project  water has always  been considered  a precious commodity  but Stan Myers  invention may make  it even more valuable  he has developed  what's called  a water fuel cell  it has taken the place  of his old gas tank  the water fuel cell  breaks down  water molecules  into oxygen  and hydrogen  the hydrogen  is used to run  his dune buggy 
[03:23:30]  I don't care  if you use rainwater  well water  city water  ocean water  if you don't have  any fresh water  go ahead and use snow  if you don't have  any snow available  to you  then use salt water  because there's  no adverse effect  to the fuel cell  if you don't have  that available to you  just cry  that'll work too  just amazing  we can run on  poisoned blood  any liquid  what an idiot  keep your mouth shut  Myers started working  on this project  four years ago 
[03:24:00]  he's not a scientist  he isn't even a chemist  in fact he never  graduated from college  Myers was determined  he says  to design something  to protect this country  from oil embargoes  we have calculated  that if we  take the dune buggy  from Los Angeles  to New York  we would roughly  use 22 gallons  of water  the pentagon flew  a lieutenant colonel  in last week  to look at Myers'  invention  there's talk  of possibly using it  in the star wars  defense program  and to run army tanks  Myers is currently  perfecting a water fuel  cell for cars  it will cost about  $1500 
[03:24:30]  he says it won't need  any maintenance  and you won't have  to replace it  it will be at least  two years before  the fuel system  goes into mass production  the day it happens  will be one  the fuel industry hates  but it will put a smile  on the face of those  who've had to say  at one time or another  fill her up  it never happened  no my favorite part  is flying in a colonel  yeah they're flying in  a lieutenant colonel  from the pentagon  and that was  also known as  a professional killer  a hitman  to use it in tanks  he's not even a hitman 
[03:25:00]  he goes in there  just gains all the information  gets all the plans  see if it works  take the invention  we'll use it later  up it works  it got crated up  and put in that big room  that the fucking  Ark of the Covenant  is in at the end  of Indiana Jones  and that Tesla guy  with the wireless technology  from the 1800s  Tesla shit  everything  they'll give us  the water powered cars  like you know  200 years after  we're all dead  oh that's great  it's gonna be  two years  before Stan's dead  so how did he die 
[03:25:30]  he was poisoning  he ran out  he said a dairy  yeah  some little restaurant  he just you know  started got up  started screaming  right in the middle  of the restaurant  they poisoned me  they poisoned me  and then collapsed  out in the parking lot  they  who's they  you should call  that restaurant  he must have known  that you know  they were on  they were on  he knew something  because the more  I'm reading about this guy  he like the  from the time  that he had announced  that he had made  this breakthrough  he just became  increasingly paranoid  and he always  you know  he never wanted  to show anybody  fully the technology 
[03:26:00]  because you know  he would claim things  like he would lose  his patent rights  and everything  so he you know  every time people  ask for a demonstration  he would show you  but not just  not the whole thing  yeah  they probably  told him to show anybody  they probably  poisoned him slowly  they were calling him up  I'm gonna fucking kill you  and then just hang up  as he's sitting there  watching like family ties  Stanley  Stanley  we're gonna kill you  what  oh  they poisoned me  they poisoned me  picks up his phone  stay away from the windows 
[03:26:30]  just get in his fucking head  slowly drive him nuts  they probably have books on that  yeah how to do it  how to just completely  drive somebody insane  make him have an aneurysm  oh yeah  what'd the report  what'd the Carter's report say  excuse me  well I think the official report  say that it said  it was some kind of  brain aneurysm  but some people believe  that the aneurysm  was brought on  by the poisoning so  oh well those guys  got poison  you can never find  there's a carno  that'll never find it  let's go to the  next invention  humans to marry robots 
[03:27:00]  by 2050  I've come up with  there's gonna be  another guy in those  I've come up with  a new vagina  that runs on water  why would you have to  marry the robot  isn't this about  having sex with robots  why would you have to  fuck the robot  I wanna know  when is that  virtual reality  sex suit  coming out  remember that  you put the sex suit  on and you put  the goggles on  anything you can  think of  you'll be feeling  like you're doing it  yeah  you can picture  the girl on top 
[03:27:30]  of you  whatever  that ain't happening  with the Wii  and little weird  technologies like that  which are kind of  interactive  they are starting  you put the Wii  controller up your ass  the Wiimote  they actually  they have  like USB  I swear  there's like a USB  vibrator  and like you could  connect to other people  kind of like on  PalTalk sort of  you know  where you can see the  person and you could  control their level  of excitement  yeah  so you slip a sleeve  over your dick  and shove a dildo  in there  and then you can  fuck with your mouse 
[03:28:00]  and like  I like that  they also have one  I think that plugs  into your iPod  that shoots out  like vibrations  according to what song  to the beat of the song  humans to marry robots  let's see what this is all about  by the year 2050  humans will fall in love  with robots  it says here  it's science  it's specifically  the science of a Dutch  researcher who claims  robots are becoming  so human-like  that it's only a matter  of time  apparently 2050  before humans  become attracted to them  getting all googly-eyed 
[03:28:30]  over them  and eventually  walking down the aisles  with machines  debates have no doubt  begun  could robots  actually be  fulfilling life partners  well shut up  it'd be a big piece  of metal  and the pussy lips  would look like  a cow mouth  by the way  we make fun  of local news  this is Fox  this is Fox News  this is Shepard Smith  Shepard Smith  is reporting this  that is fucking ridiculous  is something burning  out there  I smell the same thing  dude  what the fuck  it's it  what is it 
[03:29:00]  warning warning warning  oh my god  we almost went up  in flames  what do we got  Danny just saved us  fire  I smell it  what was it Danny  whatever  retard  decided to put all the newspapers  on top of the very hot  and bright lights  that are in the floor  that's gonna start a fire  out of these days  I knew I smelled it  if you see it over the O  you can see the  where was it  it was right over the  those lights  those halogens  those lights  are the worst design  I've ever seen in my life  love the studio  and all that  but explain  we got these lights  around the border 
[03:29:30]  of the studio  that are about a foot  off the ground  and it's so easy  to just put things  well they're on a shelf  on this little shelf  yeah you can cook shit  on there  they get so hot  I think one time  they burn through CDs  yeah they burn through  some kind of plastic  and then one time  on a Saturday night  someone came in  to film something  I think it was  actually for Uninformed  and somebody put  their camera bag  on top of it  and I had no idea  and I just smelled  burning straws  and the guy's  camera bag  had melted to the thing  we gotta fucking  put signs  or have them redesign them  they gotta take those out  that is so dangerous 
[03:30:00]  that's just not  because what's gonna happen  we're gonna like  throw newspapers on there  leave the studio  in between our show  and Ron and Fez  and this fucking place  is going off  just get elevated  like grills  to put on them  this is going  god damn  Anthony is fucking smart  thank you G  we're like  take them all out  call the police  have a fireman  just stand here  24-7 to protect us  call the engine company  Anthony just  wow  it went through  a lot of pages  oh it did  get past the sports  wow look at that

[03:37:30]  he like looks  all the way  to his body  looks all the way  like the whole  point of the meeting  was they'll be  so alone  on this little  shuttle boat  and he looks around  and he's so  he's high on  lack of sleep  fucking Robin  send that you  for a job  Robin Williams  wrecked that movie  man  that could have  been a good movie  I think  you think  yeah  gentlemen  didn't really add  to anything  but what the fuck  Jay Moore  bye Jay  alright Jay  later man  Foxports.com  if the spirit moves you  hey wait a minute 
[03:38:00]  speaking of which  Pat's  do they go undefeated  I'm asking everybody  that I can get my hands on  16-0  what  16-0  and the Dolphins  go all in 16  but you think  they're gonna have to  sit Brady  to wrestle for the playoffs  or is it more important  to get the undefeated  by three points  two games in a row  Belichick's not gonna  let him sit down  no  and here's another question  I know you're a huge  football guy there  Jay  who knows  who the backup  quarterback is  for the Pats  Brad Castle  he was the backup  to Carson Palmer  at USC  he never played a snap  he hasn't  so he's just 
[03:38:30]  it would get scary  if Brady goes out  right  he's pretty good  I mean they picked him  for a reason  he was behind  Liner and Carson Palmer  he never got  I don't think  he got a snap  I think maybe  he got 11 snacks  snaps  and some snacks  and really fast  and really fast  Jimmy's pushing  for the Cowboys  what did you say  Jimmy's pushing  for the Cowboys  I'm rooting  for the Cowboys  yeah it's gonna be  Cowboys and Patriots  in the Super Bowl  I hope so 
[03:39:00]  that would be  a great Super Bowl  from your lips  to God's ears  and what happens  Dallas gets blown out  54-10  I didn't know  you were in the studio  sweetie  yeah yeah yeah  I've been here  the whole time  oh my gosh  Tranny Island  I love them all  because of the Cowboys  Manhattan is  Tranny Island  here's Jimmy's  favorite  here's Jimmy and Quinn's  I think favorite  impression I do  it's Chris Duranzen  and Dog Day Afternoon  okay  you want to talk to him  you talk to him  don't kill me  but I have my hands 
[03:39:30]  adjusting my robe  up to college  of course you do  little Leon Shermer  never hurt anybody  you're killing everyone  around you Leon  Jay I'm getting requests  from the audience too  they need a little  Tracy Morgan  before you leave  oh I'll do that  because I'm legendary  I was on Rachel Ray  yesterday  I went to a club  with Tracy  and he said  you want to get nice  and I said  what  he goes  do you want to get nice 
[03:40:00]  yeah  Jay Moore's my uncle  so we smoke in the street  what we think is a joint  and he goes  I go  what is this  he goes  oh you never smoked  I thought you could smell it  we're like tripping on PCP  at a club  and they give me a check  because they think  I'm like his manager  and he flips the table over  and he takes off his shirt  and goes  I'm the rich N-word in here  he's out of his mind 
[03:40:30]  I hear the N-word  I'm just out the door  I'm on the sidewalk  they throw him out of the club  it's like a basement club  they throw him up the stairs  with no shirt on  he lands on the sidewalk  his shirt comes up  like a second later  like Bugs Bunny  and lands over his head  and he stands up  and goes  that's how you get out  and pay for the trick  Jay Moore  oh that's good  I like white women  yeah  everybody gets  impregnated  when big Tracy's around 
[03:41:00]  Jay I saw Tracy  at Caroline's  Jay's long gone kid  alright sorry  and uh  Tracy gave up  on his uh  his comedy  and decided  he needed to show  the front row  his pubic hair  yeah that's my bush  that's my disco bush  disco bush  and then he's trying  to get the girls  that are with dates  at Caroline's  to touch his pubic hair  and he did it  for like heaven's sake  once they touch it  it's all over  then give them  a couple of mouth farts  yeah 
[03:41:30]  ugh  fuck  sometimes I eat an apple  and I love eggs  that's exactly  Tracy  yeah  he'll just  blow shit up  I'm beautiful  you're beautiful  Captain Kirk  was beautiful  in the galaxy  in the galactic man  that's exactly  what Tracy does  yo  holy shit  you can't sleep  on them helicopter fumes  when you got  your new wheelchair gloves  I got new wheelchair gloves  I lost my legs  in Vietnam 
[03:42:00]  you gotta make sure  you got the con  with your finger cut out  so you can stack up  all your sardine money  yeah  Jay Moore's my uncle  just rambling  you find yourself  laughing  going I hope  I'm supposed to laugh  right about  it's like what the hell  is Tracy talking about  it don't matter  how do I get so skinny  it's true  alright Mr. Moore  look at my belly  that's a mating call  laughing  you're gonna do it all day  laughing 
[03:42:30]  laughing  you do Tracy Morgan  he's African  laughing  uh  Bosco  we're not in there  laughing  laughing  laughing  alright boys  God bless ya  bye sweetie  the great Jay Moore  thanks Jay  fucking Jay killing man  that is exactly  what Tracy does though  he'll just ramble shit  and you're like  what the fuck  is Tracy talking about  he's one of the few guys  though who can  not only nail the impression  but then actually  like come up with 
[03:43:00]  bits about it  like when people just do  like they'll do  Schwarzenegger  and they just  yeah and they just  do what he says  in the movie  he gets the whole  personality down  and everything  he does these  impersonations  humans to marry robots  let's get this out of the way  off our plate  and then we  then we enjoy our weekends  yeah cause I gotta guess  humans to marry robots  by 2050  that's where we were at  before he went off roading  for a while  with Jay Moore  I guess one of the theories is  and I had to read deep in this  to find anything redeeming 
[03:43:30]  but deep down in the information here  from this scientist  by the way  is maybe someday  pedophiles  and child  child molesters  and other people  who have perversions  will be able to be hooked up  with robots  so they can do their thing  in jail  and not hurt anybody  which also sounds preposterous  but I mean  there's that  it's disturbing isn't it  I wouldn't go so far as  it sounds like he's trying to say  it would be cathartic for them  or they'd leave children alone  but the problem is  they don't want 
[03:44:00]  control over machines  they want control over humans  you can't replace  that human side of people  and that's what  is more disturbing  than anything  that they're gonna  they would even think  of even placating  pedophiles  or rapists  it's about control  it's not about sex for them  so they're having  a serious discussion  about this  about having robot children  for pedophiles to fuck  yeah  who's the maker of those  and then  wouldn't that  make the pedophile  then just acceptable  that's okay  we got him a robot 
[03:44:30]  yeah it's just a robot  he gets his fix  that's okay  but then you know  it's gonna happen  the PC police  alright yeah yeah  hello this is robot  Chris Hansen  why don't you sit down  yeah exactly  hey wait a minute  but she's a robot  yeah someone will  start yelling and screaming  that robots have feelings too  and this is not right  and blah blah blah  look how adorable  it's not it's like video games  it's gonna lead to real violence  right we gotta protect  the you know  the robot kids  if they made a robot  that actually looked like  an accurate depiction 
[03:45:00]  of a kid  people would be outraged  because it looked like a kid  yeah  so you'd feel for it  and stuff  you can't just build robots  that look like real people  so you can like hunt them  a whole lot  robots to be raped  yeah  robots that you rape  you can murder  you just  and they look  and act like real people  people would be so  fucking outraged  even though it was a machine  that'll be like a new defense  I thought it was a robot  I thought it was a fucking robot  dude  what the fuck  I just 
[03:45:30]  it just looked like  the way he was walking  so I just shot it in the head  going  you pull your dick out of the test  you got little metal shavings  on the helmet  because it didn't clean out properly  a robot doesn't have to be made of metal  what are they going to make you  I don't know  a space age polymer  I don't know what a polymer is  I don't either  I just have heard that for years  most of us think old school robots  yeah  you know metal  and just clunky and stuff  I want to rape Tweaky  from Buck Rogers  beady beady beady  beady beady  if you had a robot  that 
[03:46:00]  I do  club soda Kenny  I never realized  how small his head is  it's fucking brontosaurus like  he's a fucking  he's a fucking  he's a  he's a  a leaf eater  if you had a robot  that looked  and acted  exactly  like a woman  would you rape it  sure  yeah  why not do it to women  why not to a robot  there's no like law against it 
[03:46:30]  because it would be a robot  nah it wouldn't be fun  it wouldn't be fun  no because then it would rust up  taking the shame bath  oh my god  what are you fucking  the tin man  I don't know  where do I go with that one  it's waterproof  I don't know  because it brings up  that whole moral issue  it's not rape  a robot can't say no  you just turn the fucking thing off  no but it works like  real people  there are robots walking around  let's see like  real fucking people  they look like them  they act like them  when they go to call the cops  you just unplug them 
[03:47:00]  yeah  what is your emergency  and they act like it  in a way  I got  they act like it  in a way that they're  horrified  they're terrified  it's scary for them  they're emoting  all of this  would you be able to  actually carry through  with that  punching it in the face  fucking  fucking video games  we've discussed this  where like  they're starting to look  like their emotions  are getting a little  fucked up 
[03:47:30]  where you're starting to get  a little weird  when you're killing people  yeah like in Grand Theft Auto  you take a crowbar  and you smash a hooker  over the head  but  you know  it's still on the screen  and it's a game  with kind of an interface  that is different  than actually just  punching a robot  girl in the face  I don't know  I don't think I could do that  even to a robot  we'll have to wait  what 50 years now  to find out  shit  43  yeah  with our flying cars  here's the final  the German robots  are dropping  tootsie rolls  into the mouths of humans 
[03:48:00]  that'd be tasty treats  the bionic woman  will  you can program  what kind of shit  you want  do you want solid  do you want an animal one  do you want a suppository  to bounce off your chest  the bionic woman  will  I mean  she wasn't  she wasn't maybe  tailor made  but she was sort of robotic  I guess one of the things  that this scientist points to  is how men try to create  the perfect woman  a la Stepford wives  and it's not as if  women don't try to change us  I mean the moment  the moment they got you 
[03:48:30]  then they want to make you  into somebody else  kind of like a bad  television executive  well but women  see women are improvers  women like to  they're process oriented  so they want to improve  the relationship  themselves  the man  guys are goal oriented  so once they get their goal  they're done  that's why most guys  just sit in a relationship  and they get their girl  and they're done  right  then you can eat  more trans fats  and drink more beer  because there she is  brilliant  yeah  and if it's a step  for the wife  what's she gonna say  honey go out and play golf  all day  watch your sports  with your guys  and come home 
[03:49:00]  and have sex with me  whenever you want  and only find me  if you're hungry  or want sex  and I'll be happy  with that  wow  well if that's possible  you never know  the robots might become  all the flash  you know  all the flash  of the rage  before you go to sleep  I don't know  at least next to the Blackberry  that'll keep her closer  to the room  wow  that was on Fox News  yeah that was news  horrendous improv  that had to have been  the slowest news day  in the history of news  how about  I like a robot  because you can just  put it's head  in the sofa cushions 
[03:49:30]  and deep dick it  right in the anus  while the fucking team  is playing  I almost said  while my team is playing  and I said  but while the team  is playing  what a non-sports  aficionado  the big game  while the team  that I choose  to clap for  is playing  in the big game  Thomas Overbeck  from Dallas  writes  two robots  one oil can  so  that's funny man  why don't we do  line of the day  brought to you by  BodogFantasy.net  if you  oh my god  new copy  oh barely
