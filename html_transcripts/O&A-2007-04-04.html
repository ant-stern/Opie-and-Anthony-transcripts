<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor and mocking their listeners.  A caller, Bruce, inquired about a Quentin Tarantino interview on Audible, leading to a discussion about its popularity and their shared Tarantino fandom.  They then reviewed *Grindhouse* movie reviews, focusing on Lou Lumineck's critique in the New York Post.  The conversation shifted to Ice Cube's *Are We Done Yet?*, criticizing its lack of originality and casting choices, contrasting it with Ice Cube's earlier work.  Listener suggestions, including bringing a "traveling virus" to Chicago, were briefly discussed, alongside early ratings data showing increases in Chicago and New York, with uncertain results in Philadelphia.  They mentioned meeting Ben Vereen.  The segment "Whip Em Out Wednesday" was highlighted, featuring a caller, H-Cup Jane, planning to expose her breasts on the Garden State Parkway. Opie discussed a Break.com video of a large-breasted woman, revealed to be promotional material for a band produced by the show.

The show then covered a news story about two men arrested for public lewdness, sparking a discussion about Charles Nelson Reilly and societal attitudes towards homosexuality.  A story about a 700-pound woman requiring a rescue led to a discussion about morbid obesity and related Break.com videos. Callers shared their experiences moving morbidly obese patients, including one describing finding a half-eaten cheese sandwich in a patient's folds. The next segment focused on Sanjaya Malakar from *American Idol*, debating his impending elimination.  The show briefly revisited "Whip Em Out Wednesday" and ended with a mention of Keith Richards allegedly snorting his father's ashes.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about Keith Richards's purported action (later revealed as a hoax), followed by speculation about Howard Stern's alleged attempt to influence the *American Idol* vote for Sanjaya. Light news stories, including a child-naming dispute and a Georgia man's life sentence for raping his daughter, were discussed. Jim Norton shared an embarrassing anecdote about interrupting a romantic moment to defecate, leading to sexually suggestive jokes and caller stories about awkward sexual encounters. The hosts promoted their upcoming Las Vegas comedy tour with Patrice O'Neal and the Spearmint Rhino.  They teased a Henry Winkler PSA on child molestation from 1984.

The Henry Winkler PSA segment followed, with the hosts dissecting its awkward acting, script, and content, including contributions from John Ritter and Marlo Thomas.  Listener calls, sharing reactions and personal anecdotes, punctuated the segment.  The PSA's lyrics, explicitly mentioning genitalia, were heavily discussed.  A story about a Delta flight passenger removed for smoking and assaulting the pilot was interspersed with off-color commentary and calls. The show concluded with promotion of a video, mention of the "dump report" segment, interaction with the studio audience, including conversations about penis size.

A significant portion of the show focused on US foreign policy, particularly the Iraq War, featuring callers expressing diverse opinions and using highly offensive language.  The "Daily Dump Report" segment featured sexually explicit listener stories, interspersed with crude jokes.  The hosts expressed outrage over subpar Mets game tickets provided by XM, escalating into vulgar exchanges.  The show concluded with a crude sing-along about child sexual abuse and a Vanilla Ice performance about taxes.

A segment featured the local emo band Nigel, including 17-year-old Jordan, in studio.  The hosts and Jim Norton criticized their music ("Prom Dress"). Professional wrestler "Dirty Joe Puccini" was a guest, with jokes about him using his finishing move on a staffer. Callers shared stories about molestation and sleeping with a girlfriend's boss.  Nigel's song was played, followed by more criticism from the hosts and Steve Carr.  The broadcast ended with announcements about upcoming events and Jimmy Norton's stand-up show, and the reveal of the "line of the day," "Your uncle just came. You are never to blame."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  We have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  If I were here to apologize, go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious, people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's go right to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's going on?  Good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Yeah, I love you guys.  Love the show.  Especially you, Opie.  You're the best.  But that Quentin Tarantino interview yesterday was absolutely unbelievable.  When is it going to be on audible.com for download?  You brought him out of a shell that a lot of interviewers could not do, and I loved it.  I just thought he was like that with every interview he did.  No? 
[00:02:00]  No.  Well, in a way, yes.  But no.  Other guys don't get his personality and let him come out.  When he does Jay Leno or something, they just don't get his mindset or even his movies,  I don't think.  I would like to think we are just that talented, but he seems to be the type of guy, just turn  on a mic and let him go.  Yeah.  And maybe you direct him a little bit.  Kind of like when you direct your toddler at home.  You kind of put him down and let him go, but then you keep him away from the 
[00:02:30]  power tools and keep him away from anything that might fall on him.  But you kind of like let him go.  That's Quentin Tarantino, I do believe.  I would love to take credit that we got a great...  We just got along, that's for sure.  I think being fans of his movies helps.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if a lot of people or everybody that interviews him are fans of his movies,  you know, so they really don't have that kind of like passion and fascination for his work  that we do.  I think that helps out. 
[00:03:00]  All right, Bruce.  Yeah.  Quentin can talk.  When is it going to be on audible.com so I can get it on my iPod?  Yeah, we got some stuff on audible.com.  It should be up there already.  It's usually about 12 hours behind or so.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You have a good morning.  All right.  Thank you.  You too.  Now we got to do another show today.  How does this work?  Yesterday was all good, but merely a memory.  Yeah, people barely remember the Dyke teacher bit by now.  What do you got for me today? 
[00:03:30]  You watch what we do next.  Good morning.  Yeah.  Hey, speaking of Grindhouse, three stars in the paper.  They gave it the guy...  I was just saying the reviews are starting to come out and the New York paper giving it  three stars opens Friday.  This little lumineck.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou, lumineck.  Okay, Lou.  He's a bit old.  Lou.  How's the movie, Lou?  Do you like it?  Okay, Pookie.  Let's go to see Grindhouse. 
[00:04:00]  What did Lou say?  Mary.  Murr.  What did Lou say?  Murr.  There's one for the 25 to 54 year old.  Murr.  Sitting there in front of his stupid typewriter.  What did Lou say?  No, I can't even...  Who?  Lou.  Lou.  Lou, lemonade.  What?  Lou.  Lou said that... 
[00:04:30]  Lou.  Lou.  Lou said that...  Lou.  Lou.  I'll see you on the dock, Senator.  Okay.  He said, it's easy to grin when your ship comes in.  Guy from the Post.  Guy from the Post.  What's his name?  Yeah, what's his name?  Is it Lou?  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  I'm sorry, Lou.  Lou.  Lou. 
[00:05:00]  Murr.  Mary.  Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Lou Lumineck like that.  All right, what does Lou say in the Post today about Grindhouse?  Lou gave it three stars out of, I think, four or whatever, five.  But he loved the second Tarantino one, but he really didn't like the Robert Rodriguez, the first one.  Which is probably not...  He seems like an older man, of course. 
[00:05:30]  Why would he?  Older gentleman?  Yeah, he's just a...  He really didn't like the zombie slasher film that starts off the double feature?  Right.  Planet Terror, right?  Yeah, Planet Terror.  Which I thought was really good.  It was beyond good.  It was unbelievable.  And, of course, his dope didn't like it, but I thought it was fun to watch.  And I liked the second one a lot, too.  They're two totally different movies.  So Lou Lumineck kind of half got it right.  He loved the second one.  Yeah.  Did not like the first one.  But overall, he gave the experience three stars.  He said the trailers were good, yeah. 
[00:06:00]  You know what?  Speaking of movies, no one movie I want to see this weekend is that Ice Cube movie.  Oh, God.  That looks so funny.  Are We There Yet?  Or something like that?  Oh, well...  My God, I can't wait to go.  When is it opening?  It's a sequel to Are We There Yet?  And it's called Are We There Yet?  Are We Done Yet?  Oh.  And it's called Are We Done Yet?  Oh, okay.  That's what I want to see.  And it is so funny.  You know something?  All I saw was the picture in the paper. 
[00:06:30]  They got like a half-page ad in the movie section of the post, I believe.  And it just shows the cube.  See?  And he was on a ladder that was apparently leaning against his house, Opie.  And the ladder is now pushing back.  And he's falling backwards.  Oh!  Look.  He's falling backwards.  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  See?  And he's got a look on his face like, huh?  Oh, boy.  And apparently a raccoon.  No, the raccoon is on the other side of the ladder. 
[00:07:00]  And he pushed the ladder off of the house.  Oh, that's crazy.  And he's falling.  And he's like, whoa.  And tools and paint are flying.  Oh, yeah.  And there's the house.  And look at the corner of the house.  His family's peeking around smiling at him, even though daddy's ready to break his spine  when he hits the ground.  He used to break into homes.  Now he owns one.  And then.  Oh, this is terrific.  In a move I can only say is even more disappointing than Ice Cube being in this,  John C. McGinley is in it, which is just a grave disappointment. 
[00:07:30]  I really like John C. McGinley.  I think he's very funny.  Yeah.  What was that movie he was in?  Platoon.  Yeah, of course.  A little movie called Platoon.  Of course.  That was great.  Hey there, Ralti.  Are you saving up to me, Jewish?  Best line in the movie, I think.  That was fantastic.  And the funniest part is the way Sergeant Barnes just thinks that the funniest thing.  Oh, shoot.  John.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He can't get over it.  First time Barnes has laughed since his face was blown off. 
[00:08:00]  He can't get over it.  The great joke he just heard.  Of course.  So what's up with the Ice Cube?  Oh.  All I know is he's lost like every.  When he did Friday.  Friday.  Yeah.  That was a cool movie.  That was good.  It was funny.  And it still had like that street cred.  He could get some street cred from it.  You could still hang out with your friends.  You could still hang out with the homeboys.  And it would still be cool.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  He has gone into an area where he just has none of that left.  And this is a guy who was just hardcore.  An OG, Opie.  An OG original gangster.  And now are we done yet?  Now he's doing like, yes, someone from Bayside nailed it.  He's doing the Black Money Pit.  Yeah.  The Black Money Pit.  Oh, we got the trailer, Anthony. 
[00:09:00]  This is the movie everyone needs to see Friday.  Oh, right.  This is like, what's his name?  What's the comic?  This is a Tim Allen movie with black people.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  He's got the mug face on.  Mark my words, by the way.  This is how pathetic America is, Ant.  More people will see, are we done yet this weekend?  Oh, yeah.  Than Grindhouse.  I've got to see the cube.  That's hilarious. 
[00:09:30]  Look, he's falling off the ladder.  But that'd be hilarious.  By the way, we go to RottenTomatoes.com.  Yeah.  A website that Wee's turned me on to years ago.  So far, zero stars for Are We Done Yet?  It's got nothing.  It's got nothing.  16 reviews.  They all hate it.  Nice.  Grindhouse getting very good reviews.  And you watch.  Are We Done Yet?  We'll beat out Grindhouse in the box office this weekend.  Is that it?  You know, I would have liked a nice little contrast thing where we can play a little old school ice cube and then go into the trailer. 
[00:10:00]  But E-Rock has been informing me, we can't find a song where we can play more than three words until right now we can play the first verse of a song.  Yeah.  Is that how much we can get through of old ice cube?  This is how much of a badass he used to be.  Yeah.  You couldn't even get through a song.  Now he's dressing comfortably.  He's on a ladder with a raccoon and tools.  And WA.  Oh, that stuff was great.  Yeah, he's got nine. 
[00:10:30]  All right, you got the idea. 
[00:11:00]  Look at him.  He's buck bucking.  Yeah, yeah.  He's shooting people with his nine.  Isn't that a great one?  Yeah.  That's a gem.  That's good.  That's the old school cube.  By the way, we just woke up uptown.  You guys can go back to sleep.  It's way too early for you guys. 
[00:11:30]  I think we just scared a bunch of listeners.  Yeah.  There was a home invasion going on.  There was another problem.  And the show was thrown off the air and formats had flipped.  Anyway, well, are we done yet?  Here's the trailer.  No one thought a guy like Nick Persons would settle down.  I'm Nick Persons.  But now he's a family man.  Oh, there's something that we really need to talk about this morning.  Who's about to get a big surprise.  Uh-oh. 
[00:12:00]  Honey, I'm pregnant.  So they're leaving the city behind.  So he kicks her in his stomach.  I think I'm going to be sick.  Now?  Right now.  Pregnant lady coming through.  For a new life in the country.  Ew, what's that smell?  Smells like oxygen.  The place was built in 1889.  It's a really amazing place to raise a family.  Can we really afford this house?  She is a picture-upper. 
[00:12:30]  Guess what?  I can do the fixing.  We'll take it.  Now, they're experiencing the joys of home improvement.  Oh.  See?  Everything is working out just like I promised.  I can fix that.  Mm-hmm.  I think you should just call the contractor.  Are we done yet?  Now do you want the number?  Oh, my God.  This is great.  Is this trailer done yet?  Also the local contractor.  Oh, it goes on. 
[00:13:00]  It goes on.  It's dry.  What?  He may be in over his head.  What is this?  Phase one.  But he's about to reel up.  Oh, my God.  Longest trailer ever.  He's not just building a home.  He's building a family.  I'm moving off.  I think you're a cool son.  And you're a cool dad.  Kevin!  You messed with the wrong kid.  Are we done yet? 
[00:13:30]  Honey, what was that?  The raccoon.  You think you're bad?  I got it.  Did I get him?  No.  Rascal.  Yeah, rascal.  Oh, my God.  What happened to the cube?  I don't fault Ice Cube.  I still like him.  Shut up.  No, no.  Guy's probably making five million a film.  Guy's a gangbanger.  He's making...  The movie...  The people who make these movies 
[00:14:00]  and the people who do the trailers  should be executed.  Yeah, stupid Hollywood.  He's not just building your house.  He's building your family.  Hollywood should be embarrassed.  And the way they whiten up the family.  Yeah.  They can't just have a black family  that actually black people  or talks like black people.  It's got to be a white black family.  It's got to be rated G.  Oh, it's just...  That's a good point.  Anyway, there you go.  Oh, is that awful?  Oh, look at Iraq Run.  So you got a choice this weekend.  Do you watch...  Go see Grindhouse,  or are we done yet? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, director Steve Carr.  Are we done yet?  Steve Carr is directing?  Yeah.  Yes, Cube.  I'm going to need  a little more emotion out of you.  We can't explain that  to the listeners right now.  Let's say hi to Chester's Ashes in Chicago,  listening live on WCKG.  What's up, Chester's Ashes?  Good morning, boys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  I just want to let you guys know  we got an online petition started  to get the traveling virus to Chicago.  I'd like to give out that URL  to my MySpace,  where it's in my blog,  so people can click on it 
[00:15:00]  and sign it.  All right, let's go.  All right, my MySpace URL  is MySpace.com  slash Chester's Ashes,  B as in Victor 5,  and if anybody can't get a hold of that,  just go ahead and email me  at Chester's Ashes at gmail.com.  Okay.  All right, very cool.  Yeah, we want to bring  the traveling virus to Chicago.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Anthony, to see the U-505.  Anthony, do you know what that is?  Ah, yes.  Submarine.  Yeah, the Nazi submarine  that they captured in World War II  that you get to walk through  and look through the periscope 
[00:15:30]  and everything.  Ooh.  Can I take it for a little spin?  Maybe take out a couple of ships?  All right, guys.  That's all I got.  Punch it out.  All right, thank you, sir.  Cube, cube.  No, cut.  Cut.  Ice cube.  Here's the way I want it delivered.  Why not?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That's right.  How did the squirrel die?  Now, when something bad happens  to your house,  deliver the line like this.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  And action.  Steve calls.  Steve Carr.  Our own Steve Carr  is the director.  Yes.  All right.  Hey, really fast.  We're getting some ratings  coming in this week.  Bah.  Oh.  And for the fourth month in a row,  Chicago's showing another tick up.  Just going tick.  Tick.  Tick.  Tick.  We got a long ways to go.  Nothing to brag about.  Trust me. 
[00:16:30]  But.  But.  The correct direction.  Yeah, it's just ticking up every month,  slowly but surely.  This show started with a 0.0.  0.0.  Considering we walked into a slot that, yeah, in all reality,  there weren't any listeners.  0.0.  The ratings showed 0.0 for Chicago.  Mr. Blue.  Mr. Blue Tarski.  Get the pencils out of his nose.  I love that when he turns around.  Mr. Blue. 
[00:17:00]  Mr. Blue Tarski.  Right.  So there's some promise in Chicago.  So they actually, at 0.0, to get people listening,  they actually have to go on the street and go,  look, no, no, just turn this.  Yeah, get at least one person that just,  you got to shove them in front of the rating and go,  look, at least one person's got to be forced into listening.  Like I said, nothing to brag about.  New York.  They're loving us in New York again.  Still a ways to go in New York,  but definitely moving in the right direction.  Again, right direction.  And the only other city that came in is Philly. 
[00:17:30]  Again.  Philly?  To everyone listening on WYSP,  I don't know.  We don't know.  No one knows.  I can't get an answer from Philly  because no one knows how to read the new ratings.  They're using some new wacky kind of system.  They've been using the same ratings for who knows how many years.  Decades.  And they're going with like electronic system.  And Philly's like the test market.  Yeah.  And it started last month  and this is the second month of this new rating system.  And no one could read them. 
[00:18:00]  Still can't figure it out.  I'm not even kidding.  We don't know how we're doing in Philly.  That is the truth.  They just don't know how to read them.  And then some of the radio companies didn't even want to subscribe to this new system,  but now they are.  So it's just a complete mess in Philly.  So I don't know.  I hope you guys are listening.  We have no idea.  No way of knowing.  And that's your ratings update.  Did I just see a 30-year anniversary of Roots?  Yes.  Is that what it is?  Holy mother of pearl.  Can't believe it's how long ago, right? 
[00:18:30]  30 years.  And I guess they're playing it on Easter.  They're good.  I like to TiVo it and then play it backwards.  Oh, that's right.  That's an old gag.  Oh, right.  I met Ben Vereen out in front of XM.  Did you?  Yeah.  He looks exactly the same, but he looks maybe 10 years older.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But he didn't Roots.  Yeah.  Black people just don't age.  Yeah.  It's amazing. 
[00:19:00]  Black don't crack.  That's what they say.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, let's say hi to H-Cup, Jane.  It is Whip Em Out Wednesday.  H-Cup.  Hey, guys.  Happy Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Where are you going to be today showing off those boobies of yours?  I'm going to be on the Garden State.  I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm still out here wowing.  Yeah, of course.  See, guys, this is happening.  You've got to get a wow sticker on your car or your truck or get a homemade wow sign  or ride it in the dirt.  Wow stands for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  And there are girls like H-Cup, Jane. 
[00:19:30]  They're out there right now looking for stickers.  And I just want to say one other thing to Jimmy.  Yes.  Looking forward to seeing your show at Caroline's next month.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, appreciate it.  Bring that gigantic rack.  I'll be happy to find you a seat near the front.  Hey, H-Cup, if you have any luck, call us back, okay?  Absolutely.  But it's up and down the Garden State.  I'll be there all day today.  Yeah, see, she doesn't even really go to work.  She just goes up and down the Garden State.  From what exit to what exit for the most part?  Probably from like exit 120 down to about 105. 
[00:20:00]  And what color car?  I'm in a Jeep Cherokee, and it's Army Green.  Army Green.  There you go.  H-Cup, Jane, you find that car today, you will see boobies as you're driving to work.  Yeah.  Hey, and speaking of – thank you, H-Cup.  Huge ones.  All right, speaking of boobies, I was on break.com last night just checking out videos.  No big deal.  And, you know, we talk about this all the time.  All of a sudden, it leads to something. 
[00:20:30]  Uh-huh.  And I discovered this video of this well, well, well-endowed woman in a tight-tie T-shirt.  And then she takes the T-shirt off.  And she's got a tiny, tiny, tiny little red bikini on.  Next thing you know, she's in a bubble bath, completely nude, covering up everything or trying to.  But she doesn't have enough hands to get the job done.  Like trying to hold on to two big orbs of mercury.  Right.  And I swear to God, I wasn't even looking for porn last night or anything like that. 
[00:21:00]  Nah, nah.  That's what happens with the internet.  You go on there looking for one thing.  Next thing you know, you're like, wow, how did I get here?  Yeah.  So last night, my surfing got me to big boobs, I guess.  I don't know.  And then I noticed that the video was put out by you and I.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't know we were producing such things.  And then I come running in here this morning.  I go, Steve, what is up with this? 
[00:21:30]  Because that's how I now I know how I got there.  I was just like searching our name on break.  And then I'm like checking out this and that.  Next thing I know, I'm watching this video going, I don't remember this.  I don't remember talking about this.  No one brought this to my attention.  It's some girl named Nicole.  Yeah.  She's fantastic.  So, I mean, it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  So, you know, there's a bunch of people that would love to check this out, I'm sure.  It's Nicole Takes a Valentine's Day Bath. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  We got a bunch from her.  She's washing her hiney.  How nice.  She certainly is.  She's a lot of bubbles in the tub.  And she's got this little red, what are those, boy shorts or a little, it's a thong.  Thong thing?  Because she's got quite a wedgie.  It's more boy shorts than thongs.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And it's all just ripped apart on the sides a little bit.  I just got a wedgie.  I don't wear them.  She is what's called a cam girl.  These girls do like little non-nude, like lap dance-y things in front of their little performances 
[00:22:30]  in front of their webcams, and sometimes you can chat with them live, and that's like  a promo video.  Okay.  And you get it out there the way we do it.  Promo video, it's great.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Usually promo videos stink.  Oh, but these are great, and these are some of the hottest girls.  And what we do is we use it to help promote bands and their music.  We format it like a music video, so a band can get her an unsigned band.  So the music in the background is the band.  Listen to me.  I couldn't tell you what song was playing during the big day.  Oh, I'm sure you couldn't.  Not even if the band was behind her playing it live. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, I'm sure.  But you know what?  But as much as you, you know, but people pay attention to it.  It's got like half a million views on it already.  Yeah, it's moving up the list of most viewed videos on Break.com.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Nicole takes a Valentine's Day bath.  After you see that video, you might want to call us and tell us what you think.  That's too big, actually.  I mean that.  I like large breasts, but they're giant, like, fake breasts, and they're not necessary on her.  They're fake, but the doctor did a very good job. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, excellent.  Just not necessary.  If she's got a little B cup, she'd be perfect.  There you go.  It is Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We're just getting started.  Oh, my God.

The O&A virus spreading across America.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I see Whip Em Out Wednesday is alive and well on Pal Talk this morning, Anthony.  Yes.  Trying to find it.  It just adds to the listening experience, this Pal Talk. 
[00:24:30]  We've got the cameras in studio, webcams, and, you know, they get to listen to us during breaks.  We get to watch.  We get to watch our listeners listen to us.  I don't know what cam that is.  Kind of weird.  Wow, does this, look at this, there's an ad in here for a blackbird or whatever, and it says full counts.  But look at the way that's written, the way the O is scratched through.  Oh.  What does your mind say when you see that?  Almost looks like a bad word for girls.  That's amazing.  They did that on purpose.  They certainly did because that little blue line. 
[00:25:00]  Subliminal advertising, man.  That really works.  Yeah, sometimes.  With you.  If you look really closely into...  Anybody will think, will see that.  Into ice cubes and stuff, you'll see, like, orgies going on.  Yeah.  I learned about that in school.  But they do actually do that.  Oh, yeah, you mean like an airbrush or a liquor ad and stuff?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But if you look really closely, you'll see some crazy stuff in, like, especially ice cubes.  They have a lot of fun with ice cubes and ice in general.  And they said that the camel cigarette ad, that went with Joe Camel. 
[00:25:30]  Joe Camel, yeah.  It was a big pile of junk.  A big bag.  Yeah.  A big bag.  That's what it was.  Cute towards women, not kids.  You don't see him anymore.  All right.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  We got lots to do today.  We got a 700-pound woman that had to be taken out of our home in Jersey.  Trying to get some audio of that.  She's a fan of this show.  Another fatty.  A man busted for...  Wow.  Can we even do this story on the air? 
[00:26:00]  This is a crazy one.  What did he do?  We'll play ad-libs, I guess, here.  Two creepy motorists put on a disgusting roadshow for cops in broad daylight after they were pulled over in Brownsville, authorities said yesterday.  Sources said the strange Brooklyn incident occurred Saturday as Tommy was driving a 2007 Toyota Camry while his passenger, Ivan, was blanking him.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  While he was blanking him. 
[00:26:30]  While he was blanking him.  Huh.  Should we guess?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Alright.  Two creepy motorists put on a disgusting roadshow for cops in broad daylights.  Tommy was driving while his passenger, Ivan, was blanking him.  Fanny?  I say quizzing him.  Ah, quizzing.  Hmm.  Everyone's writing down their answers. 
[00:27:00]  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh, he's got it right.  He's like, oh, this is an easy one.  This is easy.  Wow.  I'm going to put the marker in my mouth.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Look, I'm wearing an ascot.  Wow.  Wow.  That guy came to a game show wearing an ascot.  Are we going to do the whole show for 35 to 64-year-olds today?  Did anyone think that guy was straight? 
[00:27:30]  Even as a kid, I'm like seven years old going, God, what a fag.  Back in the day, though, they didn't talk about the homosexual.  No, everyone, like, loved everybody and didn't really think about that.  Like, um...  Paul Lynn.  Paul Lynn.  Paul Lynn.  You saw him as a center square and you're just like, oh, it's Paul Lynn.  Everyone loves him.  He's a little quirky.  Just a little quirky.  But you weren't thinking he was doing, like, poppers and, you know, taking it.  Because they just didn't talk about the homosexual. 
[00:28:00]  Power bottom.  Now, nowadays, it's all about the homosexual.  The homosexual.  Yeah, you're right.  I'll tell you something, Riley.  Oh.  I didn't know about any of that stuff growing up.  No.  I just thought he was whatever.  Flamboyant.  Yeah.  Like Liberace.  Yeah, like Liberace.  Your grandma would be watching Liberace.  Come here, watch Liberace with your grandma.  And you sit down and watch and go, this guy's not like guys I see. 
[00:28:30]  It's not like dad or his friends.  Yeah.  Or like when we have father-son breakfast day at school.  None of the dads are like Liberace.  But he's a man, Grandma.  Oh, yes.  He's wonderful.  Listen to him play the piano.  Yeah.  And Grandma knew.  Grandma knew.  Grandma knew.  Don't ask questions.  Don't ask questions and don't end up like him.  But he's wonderful.  All right.  So there you go.  Tommy was driving while his passenger, Ivan, was blanking him. 
[00:29:00]  That's when a police car heading to a call tried to pass the vehicle at Rockaway and Dumont  Avenues with its emergency lights flashing.  Tommy allegedly failed to yield, so officers stopped his vehicle.  As the officers approached, they saw the pair still involved in their dirty deed, sources  said.  What'd they think?  The cops are going to go hot.  You can go.  It's like it's two girls.  Like if two girls are doing this, it would be fine.  The cops probably would join in, let them go. 
[00:29:30]  Everyone's having a good time.  It could be a callback to yesterday's bit.  Same type of thing, although it's not the Dyke gym teacher, but it's the tough cop.  The tough cop.  Walking up to the window.  Yeah.  Licensing.  Knocks on it with his flashlight.  Licensing Reggie, please.  What the hell is going on in there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's hot.  He can't even get the statement out.  Licensing.  Licensing. 
[00:30:00]  Steamy.  I, uh, I'm going to go back to my, my, uh...  You got a license for that?  Do you have a license to carry?  Yeah.  Whoa, hey, there's something you don't see every day on Pal Talk.  What am I missing?  Cafe Latte.  Just a flash for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Is that it?  I, I, I don't have the, the names down.  Poison Shatara.  Yeah, is she a good one?  Oh, yeah, she's a good one.  Whip Him Out Wednesday is alive and well on Pal Talk. 
[00:30:30]  Anyway, so, one cop ordered, uh, Tommy to, to zip it up, but he wouldn't.  He wouldn't?  He refused?  Not only did he refuse, they refused to stop.  Ugh.  Both were charged with public lewdness, and Tommy was additionally charged with improper  operation of a vehicle.  Tommy.  Of course he couldn't operate properly.  Can't drive right.  You're hitting the brake and the gas at the same time.  Your legs are twitching.  And then they were released on their own recognizance. 
[00:31:00]  Cognizance.  Their own recognizance.  You can go now.  On your own recognizance.  Finish your business.  You're doing that.  Why don't you just get out of the way when a cop is driving through?  Yeah.  They want to get caught.  Pick your head up, dummy.  Well, the best part, they refuse to stop.  No.  You do get to the point of no return, though.  It's like, ah.  Yeah, don't you stop.  At this point, Mom could work in.  There's nothing I could do, man.  I mean, this is it.  Nothing I can do. 
[00:31:30]  Finish faster.  That's what I mean, though.  Mom.  The point of no return happens.  Mom.  Mom.  Ah.  In other news, this monster in Trenton.  Oh, you got the story, Jimmy?  I do, yeah.  It says, rescue cruise freedom.  I love these words.  Morbidly obese woman.  Morbidly.  From her Mercer County home.  They were called in because she fell in the upstairs bathroom.  They said she weighed about 700 pounds.  And they said she was in good spirit.  She had a pleasant personality. 
[00:32:00]  Of course she did.  In that situation, I'm just a big gal.  Big fat snow trap between the radiator and toilet.  That's how they found her?  Yes.  Oh.  That's wonderful.  That's good.  Hope the radiator left a brand on the cow.  They had to dismantle the toilet and radiator and rip out part of the bathroom wall and window  in order to get, like, a large enough hole.  You know that toilet's probably seen some action like Normandy.  The beaches of Normandy.  I bet the toilet was thanking the rescuers.  The lid actually opened and went, I appreciate it. 
[00:32:30]  They took the toilet out on a stretcher and put it in the ambulance.  Damn, things all cracked.  The woman who was taken to the hospital in a specially equipped ambulance, the only one  in the state able to move, I say, is a patient of that size.  Flatbed?  Yeah, that's what they should have thrown on.  They should have grabbed her by the ankles like cattle and just dragged her to the hospital.  Roper.  Any sympathy for the...  Morbidly obese?  Yeah, any?  On the level of how awful it must be to live that way, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Nobody wants to.  No.  But the fact that you would...  Let's say alcoholics.  I mean...  No.  Or drug addicts.  You are technically making your own misery.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Food's a harder one to quit.  Food.  It is disgusting.  I have no sympathy.  None.  I love watching the videos on Brick.com.  You put in, I don't know, fat or something like that.  Fabby.  And you get to see these monsters and it's comedy.  Monsters.  It's comedy for the whole family.  Oh, that's awful. 
[00:33:30]  It really is, though.  I mean...  And then you...  You want to, like, strangle the family members and go...  Yes.  When did you realize that this was a problem?  Did you ever realize this is a problem?  They continue bringing the food.  The person can't even move anymore.  So, there you go.  You can take care of the situation.  Yep.  Someone's enabling.  And I know doctors are going to say, blah, blah.  I'm saying, look, you can start giving them a little less food every day.  Just a little, little, little.  And then eventually they're eating a lot less.  Or healthy food.  How about a salad instead of ho-ho's? 
[00:34:00]  Tell yourself, no, that's where I have no empathy at all.  Because then they go, no, I don't want...  Yeah, no, just give me that.  Yeah, just one.  Just let me...  Okay, when the fire department's breaking a hole in your home.  Keep up the gregarious chit-chat.  Yeah, because when I see these videos online, like, it's so tough.  I want to stop, but I can't, you know.  And then they show them frying up, like, everything.  Everything.  Like, fried salad.  I mean, everything is fried.  It's like, you make your own choices. 
[00:34:30]  Like, yesterday, I wanted an ice cream, like, shake so bad.  I was craving one of those.  You know what I did?  I went and got a boring freaking juice thing.  Juice.  Like, vegetable juice thing.  Juicy.  With a body like yours, you can afford to eat once in a while.  All right.  I'm just saying, you're in amazing shape.  All right.  Wait for the pictures.  Then we'll discuss.  What's wrong with someone commenting on the incredible physique of his friend?  Let's say hi to Gino.  Is that the end of the story, Jimmy? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's, uh, alive.  Is she okay?  Um, as in corral?  Yes.  See, there.  Here's one.  She is okay.  She's Oklahoma.  Here's one.  John Kites.  K-E-I-T-Z.  Or the 750-pound man.  Right there on one of our websites that we're not allowed to mention right now.  Yeah, that one didn't make it.  I think that's that show that at the end they say he's dead. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, well.  Uh, Gino, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Great show.  Hey, thanks, Gino.  Hey, listen.  I used to move these fat bastards around.  Well, I mean, you get to move one a decade?  I mean, it's not like you're moving one of these people around every day.  Oh, let me tell you.  In Newark, where I used to work, we had like seven or eight frequent flyers who were all that friggin' size.  No kidding.  You worked in a hospital?  Oh, yeah.  Say what?  Hospital?  I think you, what are you, like EMT or something like that? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, I was on the ambulance back then.  Okay.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  Go.  No, no, no.  Honestly, I had nothing.  How bad does the smell, dude?  Oh, dude.  That's kind of what I was going to ask.  These people, like Jimmy said, these people make their own misery.  We moved one once.  We flipped her bed over to get her out.  She had, no kidding, a case of chocolate bars under her bed.  There you go.  That's what you get.  Yeah.  How about a case of something that's not disgusting like that for you?  That's where it's like, you got to stop. 
[00:36:30]  Yes, yes.  I mean, where does the food come from?  It ain't like they're running down White Castle on their own.  If they had that kind of thought process where, you know, I'm going to eat better than this,  they would never have gotten to that point.  Well, you can always change it.  I mean, look, what you have to do is this.  You're eating like that.  Whoever molested you.  Right.  Write a letter to them and then burn it.  Burn it.  Give it up.  Get it out of your system.  Yeah.  So the smell was really bad?  Oh, the smell, it's indescribable.  Yeah.  There are places on these people's bodies that no one has reached in years. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Big, hidden, dark, dank fold.  That grow mold.  Yeah.  Oh.  Skin tags.  When I tell you to get these people off the floor, to get them off the floor, you're going  to injure three people.  I mean, we use equipment that they use to lift a train.  No, no.  The reference was SeaWorld, sir.  We were all waiting for it. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Like Shamu when they got to put them in a different tank.  And you were there.  You were like, like, like, and everyone was yelling at their radios.  It's like, well, well.  We use that SeaWorld.  Trains.  They don't really lift trains and move them around much.  They just stay on the tracks.  The bit is like Shamu and Miller Wells and SeaWorld.  That was your reference, sir.  The best thing to do is when you see someone that fast, go, you look pretty good, actually.  Like, did you lose anything?  This way they'll think, like, oh, the eating's not getting me, and they'll just keep doing  it.  I could eat more. 
[00:38:00]  Here, let me put a tag on it.  We used to call these jobs operation Dumbo Drop.  Does that help?  There you go.  Dumbo Drop.  Ah, good.  Make a reference to an awful 10-year-old movie.  All right, Gino.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  All right.  Somebody get that, by the way, that thing you think you're not racist on CNN tonight at 8 o'clock.  Please tape that.  Oh, yeah?  You have to hear that politically correct drivel.  All right, Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, what's up, Steve?  Hey, I was on that job yesterday in South Jersey with that lady.  She was enormous.  700 pounds. 
[00:38:30]  How big is 700 pounds?  Let me tell you something.  700.  Let me tell you something.  Wait a minute, dude.  Dude, you were on that job.  What was the name of the street she was on in what city?  Hamilton.  What city?  Hamilton Township.  What do you know of the street?  I don't know.  I wasn't driving.  They woke me up when I got there.  I was tired.  I did it double.  Are you lying to get on our show, sir?  I think you might be fibbing. 
[00:39:00]  No.  What color was she?  Why would I waste my time?  All right.  What color was she?  Why would I waste my time?  That's the best answer I've ever heard.  Hey, we give you a...  You're faking.  Just to get on the...  Why would I waste my time?  All right.  Go ahead.  You'd be right.  All right.  So what do you got there, Steve?  Stop.  Just telling me.  She was enormous.  You see these people in restaurants and stuff?  Her ankles were as big as my thighs.  Yeah, the ankles always...  You ever see, like, morbidly obese people walking around before they get to this point? 
[00:39:30]  Their ankles look like they're under such strain.  Like, they're full...  They look like Sharpay.  Like, all folded.  And...  It looks like she screwed her shoes on.  Very funny.  I screwed her shoes on.  I never heard of that one before.  That's a good one.  I might have to steal that one, Steve.  That's too good.  Let me tell you.  I've been on a lot of jobs where people fall out in their head and they get between the  bathroom and the toilet.  Yeah.  When they took that toilet out, it was thankful. 
[00:40:00]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks a lot.  Have a good day.  Yeah, you should have left after that line, man.  That was one of those lines where you just drop the microphone and leave.  You just leave on a laugh like we want more and you're gone.  That's all you're going to give us.  But instead, he's like, the toilet, the toilet, the letter of gratitude to the prosecutor.  What?  Get all to yourself.  Go.  Know when to leave the program.  Drop your phone and leave. 
[00:40:30]  Speaking of, I don't know, eating and stuff, Sanjaya performed last night.  Where does that have to do with eating?  Well, remember, this is an update.  Remember the fatty that was on a hunger strike?  Oh, okay.  I knew you'd bring it around.  You want to explain to the fine folks out there?  Yeah, some fat broad was on a hunger strike until Sanjaya got booted off the show.  Yeah.  She went on a hunger strike.  Apparently, she got hungry.  I love hunger strikes because no one could ever commit. 
[00:41:00]  It's very difficult.  I think when you get up to like two weeks, you're like, oh my God, what am I doing?  Uh-oh.  This sucks.  This is serious.  This doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon.  So, Fatty had to eat.  Hi, this is Jay.  It's been 16 days since I started my hunger strike.  16 lousy days.  What's the record?  I don't know.  It's going to be 16 days.  I have no idea. 
[00:41:30]  Well, voluntary or involuntary?  I'm talking like Gandhi did one, right?  How long did Gandhi go?  Did Gandhi do a hunger strike?  Give me some of the famous hunger strikes and how long they went.  Who's the most famous one?  DiMaggio and then Pete Rose did 40.  Oh, no.  And I regret to inform you that I went to the doctor's the other day and he advised me against  continuing this hunger strike.  Duh.  Can we pause that for one second? 
[00:42:00]  I'd like to ask you a question.  Did you think the doctor was going to say, good, 16 days without food, keep up the good  work?  Keep going.  I'm recommending you don't eat.  Thank you.  See, I got my answer.  Oh.  Back in 1975, somebody went 385 days without eating and somebody?  Who's the somebody?  No.  They got the record and we don't even have the name.  That's impossible.  That has to be impossible.  They must have had some type of supplement. 
[00:42:30]  Right, right.  You can't just live on water for over a year.  No.  All right.  Continuing this hunger strike.  I, for medical reasons, I'm going to discontinue the strike.  However, I do plan on continuing to vote for other contestants.  Oh, well, that's brave.  And I hope that everyone who has supported me will continue to do the same.  Supported me?  Like she's on a hunger strike until our boys come home from Iraq. 
[00:43:00]  Attention whore.  Supporting me?  What a nation of self-centered asses we're in.  Oh, absolutely.  Thank you for supporting me.  How about you do this for the troops in Iraq and you're not going to eat until they come home?  Then I'd be impressed.  Can we get her on the phone?  I mean, I would love to get this back on the phone.  She's probably ordering takeout all day today.  She'll probably get a busy signal.  She probably was sneaking food the whole time.  Everyone who has supported me will continue to do the same. 
[00:43:30]  If you joined me in the hunger strike, I strongly encourage you not to continue this as well.  It can be very bad for you.  It can end very badly.  We will be organizing a voting strategy for the coming weeks, so stay tuned to our MySpace page for more information on that.  Thank you very much.  That's MySpace.com slash Anthony Cumia. 
[00:44:00]  That's where you could get her.  Wow.  Do you have info on her, Travis?  No.  The longest hunger strike ended in 1973 after 385 days when Dennis Gaylor Goodwin protested his innocence in Wakefield Prison.  Work your share of a rape charge.  He was fed by tube orally.  Oh, okay.  Fed by tube orally.  Going back to the other story, the guys in the car.  That wasn't the answer, by the way.  No.  No, it was not the answer to the other story. 
[00:44:30]  It was a rowboat operation style.  Just imagine, you know, shifting a car.  That's right.  A lot.  And then cleaning your knuckles.  Are you kidding me?  No.  And here I was thinking it was the other thing.  No.  I bet every one of our listeners thought it was the other thing.  Well, yeah.  We wanted them to believe that it was that, but it was the other thing.  Oh, okay.  There was a lot of car shifting going on.  Oh, it was shifting the car.  Okay.  I got you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Interesting.  Don't drive the car like that. 
[00:45:00]  You've spilled yogurt on your knuckles.  So what do you think?  Sanjaya goes through again?  You know, because Howard Stern is telling all his listeners to vote, so of course.  But I thought he was off this week.  He is.  He's off.  He's on vacation.  I could always tell when he's on vacation.  A couple of ass wipes have to come through to the pal talk room.  Yeah.  It's like two or three.  Whole day.  Ah, they're just bored.  Yeah.  Does Sanjaya get voted off tonight? 
[00:45:30]  I'm going to say, I was going to say yes.  Like last night I was saying, yeah, I think he's gone because no one really cares.  It's kind of, you know, that whole, the whole thing about him staying on is kind of papering off like into the who cares category.  I think he has another week, but the tides changed last night.  A little overexposure kind of thing.  Yeah, people were like, all right, this was fun.  But now.  Yeah.  See, that's how Americans are.  That's how I felt.  That's what I felt last night when I was watching.  They're just about done with their obsession with Sanjaya. 
[00:46:00]  It's like a gimmicky thing, and then it's like, yeah, you get bored with it.  Right.  And for people that think, this is why the media sucks.  They all jumped on the whole Howard Stern is keeping this guy on the show.  It's so ridiculous.  Howard Stern does Howie math, and the media's really got to start paying attention, and they got to do the math themselves.  Yeah.  Howie's talking to tens of thousands of people every day.  That's it.  That's it.  You know how many people are voting for American Idol every week? 
[00:46:30]  30-some-odd million.  Mm-hmm.  Just do the math.  It doesn't watch.  The media looks completely stupid for running with that story.  Sanjaya just became his own sensation since he tried out for the damn show.  Yeah.  He knows how to market himself.  Everyone's talking about him.  He's on the front page of a lot of newspapers.  He's on the front page of magazines.  They're doing stories all over the news about him because of his hair thing.  That's why he stays on the show.  Yeah, he had a gimmick.  He had a gimmick.  And now it's kind of wearing thin. 
[00:47:00]  And so I was going to say, yeah, it's done.  They'll vote him off.  I think he's going to work.  But then I saw his performance, and at the beginning I'm thinking, oh, he's got to be gone.  But then he gets up and starts, like, dancing with Paula a little bit during his song.  And I'm like, all right, that's enough to push him through.  The audience is like, woo, yeah.  I was like, uh-oh, that might put him over.  Yeah, he's got maybe one, maybe two more weeks left.  I think one.  That's it.  But you can see that the tide is definitely changing. 
[00:47:30]  How many people are left on the show?  Nine, I think.  Oh, I think he's going to make top five.  I mean, that's just my American Idol pick.  Oh, Jimmy.  All right, so we're into the who gives a crap category.  I don't know.  I think that the other ones aren't as electric.  Electric.  I love these stories.  Flaming.  Al, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Al.  How you doing?  What's up, Al?  How you guys doing?  All right.  I had a funny story about we, I work at a hospital where we work on these morbidly obese patients. 
[00:48:00]  We had to do a test on the upper thigh of one of these, she had to be five or 600 pound woman.  We had to get two guys to lift her belly up.  One thing fall on the floor.  It was a half of a cheese sandwich with two bites missing out of it.  Are you joking?  No.  This has to be a joke.  No, I'm serious.  How do you not know that there's a sandwich in between your belly folds? 
[00:48:30]  Don't ask me.  Did you eat it?  Oh, God.  How bad did you smell?  That would have been fantastic to have to make somebody eat that sandwich.  Excuse me, worst guy ever on radio?  How bad does your smell?  Oh, the smell is horrendous.  What kind of sandwich was it?  It was a cheese sandwich.  Oh, you said that.  Okay, all right.  Wait, did she have a mayo on it?  On the outside?  Yeah, after it was.  How did this sandwich fall out?  I could see if it was a crumb. 
[00:49:00]  It was just bread.  It turned into a cheese sandwich sitting there so long.  Oh, funny.  You put bread there and 20 minutes later you pull back the fat and it's a Subway sandwich.  It's got lettuce and tomato wine.  Small worker.  Oil and vinegar.  Skin tags.  A little fat person's skin tags.  Joe, check it out.  All right, Al.  Thank you.  That was disgusting.  Skin tags.  You ever see like fat people get the big skin tags on the back of the neck?  I just like to go over and flick them.  Flick your skin tag.  Do we need to listen to Sanjay?  Everyone who cares has heard last night. 
[00:49:30]  I want to hear him sing a little bit.  I've not heard.  I was busy.  You've got to take a look at this American Idol there, Jimmy.  This guy was all slicked back.  Yeah, he went for the slicked back sort of look with a little white jacket on.  White suit jacket.  Heaven, I'm in heaven, and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak, and I seem to find 
[00:50:00]  the happiness I see.  When you bury it between my cheeks.  He's really not that bad, but nothing special.  He's not bad if he's singing at your daughter's birthday party.  Right, right.  But for national television.  In front of 30 million people a year, you're looking for something a little better than this.  Oh, I love you.  So, whatever.  I mean, that was him last night, and then, you know, this is what Simon had to say. 
[00:50:30]  Let's try a different tactic this week.  Yeah, what are you going to say?  Incredible.  We'll leave it at that.  You do a great job staying under the radar, Sanjay.  I see he was exaggerating.  Did Ryan give Simon the business again?  That Ryan's really coming into his own.  Ryan does a great job staying under the radar.  Well, you know, because the story's definitely my day.  Everyone hates him. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, he stinks.  Why is he so hateable?  Because he's so successful.  Because he's such a pretty boy.  Yeah, that's what it is.  He's got three or four shows he does every day.  He does a morning show.  He does American Idol.  He does the Daily Ten or E! News every night.  Yeah, he hosts the hugest show on television.  And then he hosts everything that Dick Clark used to host.  Yeah.  The guy's everywhere.  Hope he suffers the same fate.  But basically, Sanjay, the judge has basically said, look, we're not even going to comment  about your singing anymore because we've already told you you suck. 
[00:51:30]  So they're commenting about everything else.  All right.  That's it.  There's your little update.  Nothing.  Good luck to you.  So you think he makes it through tonight?  Yeah.  One more week?  One more week of dopes voting for him and then they'll be tired of him.  And then people are like, all right, I didn't know.  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip him out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Ready?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female. 
[00:52:00]  I'm not a mate.  Wow.  It's Whip him out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip about Wednesday.  Hopefully, you have your wow stickers on your car or your truck.  We haven't heard from H-Cup Jane since she called in.  She was going to call if she had some luck finding people with wow stickers on the Garden  State Parkway today.  Wow-age.  Out there in Jersey.  Just kind of got light out.  Hard to wow in the pitch black.  You know what? 
[00:52:30]  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  Yeah.  Well, we're all waking up to the news.  I mean, the world is a crazy place.  Is it?  Oh, it's just insane.  But the front pages of the New York papers, we're waking up to the news that Keith Richards  snorted his father.  I snorted my dad.  He mixed what?  His father's ashes with a bit of cocaine?  Or actually, it was a lot of cocaine and a bit of ash.  And then a fourth, Jimmy pointed out, you got to give credit to the New York Post when 
[00:53:00]  they get a good one.  The New York Post, father knows best.  Oh, but knows is spelt N-O-S-E.  I get it.  Rolling Stone, I snorted dad's ashes.  So, I mean, this story is all over the place.  And it proves one thing.  Every paper picked it up, right?  Every paper picked up on this story, yeah.  Some papers that are a little more conservative, you know, they buried it.  Yeah.  Deeper into the paper, but not the New York Post, man. 
[00:53:30]  You got to wake up to that headline today.  And it just proves one thing.  The media will pretty much print anything.  See, they're showing it on the news right now.  There you go.  There it is.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Keith just looks...  And that's an older video of Keith Richards, by the way.  Is it?  He always looks sweaty.  Like, he smells like your grandmother.  Headband.  I went to one of the press conferences a couple years back.  He looks like...  Like, you ever see alien autopsy?  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  You ever see, like, an alien's body?  It's kind of, like, pouchy?  Yeah.  And it has, like, really thin arms with no muscles on it?  Don't need no muscles, those aliens.  And then, like, stick legs?  Sure.  That's what Keith Richards looked like.  Alien.  Awful!  But the media, you know, they're just gullible.  They will print anything.  Why do a little research?  Why try to find out if it's true or not?  You know, someone tells them, hey, this was in a magazine interview.  Well, print it! 
[00:54:30]  Front page!  They don't do any background checking whatsoever.  Did he give any explanation as to why he did this?  To feel closer to his father.  I think they had had a falling out in, like, late 60s when his father and the mother split up.  Uh-huh.  He even dropped the S from his last name.  They said it was Keith Richards for a long time.  And then they reconciled, like, 1980.  And Dad came on tour with him and they made up.  And then I guess their father died in 2002 and he dreamt about him a lot.  Are you telling me the truth or is this one of these Jimmy stories?  No, this is true. 
[00:55:00]  Okay.  And then Jimmy will rattle off something like that and you'll go, really?  And he'll go, no, I have no idea.  No, that is true.  They reconciled and the father came on tour with him and stuff.  Well, here we go.  What does an aging rocker do for a start me up?  That's a song, too.  Oh, boy.  Lila Day Kretzer was the writer for that cute line.  That's a good name.  Well, he snored his dead father's ashes, of course.  Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards has admitted that he once mixed his dad's ashes with cocaine, 
[00:55:30]  rolled up a bill, and inhaled the mixture up his schnoz.  Inhaled.  The 63-year-old guitarist made the shocking confession enough to make a dead man cry.  Can you just get a few more of those wacky...  Wow, I almost passed on that, so let me try that again.  The 63-year-old guitarist made the shocking confession, comma, enough to make the dead man cry, comma,  in the latest edition of British music magazine NME. 
[00:56:00]  The strangest thing I've tried to store it?  Well, my answer is my father.  I stored it in my father, Richard says in a feature about his impact on rock that hit Stance Friday.  He was cremated, and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow.  It went pretty well, and I'm still alive.  Richard's dad, Bert, was in World War II.  He's a World War II vet who worked in a factory for much of his life.  In the mid-60s, about the same time Richards was expelled from school and formed a friendship with Mick Jagger,  his father split with his mother.  While Richards stayed close with his mom, he was estranged from his dad for more than 20 years 
[00:56:30]  and even dropped a S from his surname.  Wow, that's really showing everybody.  Instead of being known as Richards...  I'll show you.  Right.  Wow.  A lot of you don't understand, but my father's a real S-O-B.  My real name is Jim Norton'd.  I had a falling out with him once.  I thought it was going to be Jim Norton's.  No, no, no.  Jim Norton'd.  Norton'd.  It's N-O-R-T-O-N with a capital D at the end and an apostrophe, and it just stops.  Norton'd. 
[00:57:00]  So, they're all printing this up today, right?  Yeah.  And, well, the media has been had.  Why?  You don't think, uh...  No, we got an update.  We do.  It's from the father.  Did Keith Richards really snort his dad's ashes?  No.  It was a joke.  He said it in an article as...  In jest.  Like, kind of joking.  Comments made in a magazine interview were only said in jest, manager tells MTV News. 
[00:57:30]  Maybe you saw the Keith Richards item that started popping up all over the place on Tuesday.  The one about...  All right, blah, blah, blah.  All right, in a buzz-killing mood, though, we decided to check the Richards' longtime manager,  Jane Rose.  This is all he had to do, but...  Somebody actually checked.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Like, the Daily News, they don't check their facts.  The Post doesn't check their facts.  These dumb, dopey morning news shows, they don't check their facts.  They're lazy.  One person decided to...  Well, you know what?  Why don't I check this out a little bit? 
[00:58:00]  So they went to Richards' longtime manager, Jane Rose.  We asked her about the dad snorting quotes in the NME interview.  She responded with an email.  Said in jest, she explained, can't believe anyone took it seriously.  Yeah, that's great.  In a buzz-killing mood, though, we decided to check with Richards' longtime manager.  Yeah.  That's all you have to do is check.  No one else.  Then again, he thinks...  It was such a great story, no one bothered to try to confirm it with Richards' representatives.  Why spoil the fun with facts? 
[00:58:30]  You think he told the truth and then just was embarrassed at how big it got?  Probably not.  He wouldn't care.  Keith Richards wouldn't care.  Keith Richards, at this point in his life, what's he got to be embarrassed about?  He doesn't care.  He wouldn't care whatsoever, right?  That guy's probably making $200,000, $300,000 a year.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Perhaps more than that.  And by the way, we were doing the Howie math for everybody,  and a New York criminal, none from New York City off the instant feedback.  This is why it's so frustrating with the media.  They could do their own math. 
[00:59:00]  They could look into some of these things, but instead, you know,  they just print up a story, and then everyone else prints up the same story.  No one does their own research or fact-checking.  If it's funny or sensational, they'll just run with it.  Why check?  So Howard Stern, he went on a show, and I guess he's trying to get his fans to vote for Sanjaya,  which is very interesting.  But the fact is, Sanjaya is just his own sensation.  Yeah.  His own marketing genius.  It's a drop in the bucket. 
[00:59:30]  There's other websites, vote for your worst idol.  But, you know, Howard's claiming he's the one keeping Sanjaya on American Idol, right?  Right.  And I'm sitting at home like, will you just do simple math, you dumb news reporters?  So a New York criminal did.  He writes, if 500,000 Stern fans vote 10 times, first of all, he doesn't have 500,000 fans that would vote.  He just doesn't.  But let's say he does. 
[01:00:00]  And they vote 10 times each.  10 times.  Each fan, each 500,000 of these fans would have to vote 10 times each.  Every single one of them.  That would have to add up to 5 million votes.  Yeah.  If you could accomplish that, which right there is insane, right?  Well, there's over 30 some odd million votes every week for these idol contestants.  Yeah.  You're going to sway the vote?  How are you going to sway the vote?  Maybe back in the old days when he was on regular radio and he was talking to, I believe it was close to 18 million people a week. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, perhaps then you can sway a vote.  But now, I mean, it's safe to say he's probably talking to about a half a million a week.  That was a week?  I thought that was a day when people broke it down, like how many listeners you have.  No, no.  It was like 18 million a week or so.  And I think that's a high number.  I don't know exactly.  I'm sure Tom will run in here to tell us the exact facts.  But there you go.  But the media, they don't bother just doing basic math problems and then at least writing this scenario. 
[01:01:00]  Like, well, if he's claiming this, well, this is what would have to happen for him to make a mark on the voting.  Yeah.  But instead, they just print it up like, you know, it's got to be true because he said it.  Because he said it.  Right.  Yeah, that's the source.  The guy.  Jesus.  People are dopes.  All right.  In other news, this, I guess it's a slow news day.  I guess maybe none of our troops died in Iraq overnight or something.  I don't know.  I'm sure.  Yeah, well, you've got to have the front page with Keith Richards, though, of course, right? 
[01:01:30]  With the fake story.  The fake story is the get today.  The fake story makes the front page of all the newspapers.  Yeah, you know, the British thing.  That might just become.  Ah, it's blowing over.  Ah, that might turn into World War III.  But ah, Keith Richards snorting his dad.  Come on.  Could blow over.  Speaker of the House in Syria.  Yeah.  Pelosi's in Syria talking.  That's right.  Talking with the Syrian leader.  Trying to convince him to get a chin implant so he doesn't look so ridiculous from the  side.  Like, you look like a sock puppet, sir. 
[01:02:00]  All terrorists respect you.  Could you just stop at the mustache?  All terrorists respect you.  They do.  I don't like how American women have to wrap up when they go over there.  It's insulting, right?  They all got to wrap up.  How come when they come here, they scream and cry that they don't want to unwrap?  Because we're a free society, and they're not.  Are we really free?  Are we?  Well, I mean, really, Hope.  I don't know.  Kid caught me on that one, Jim.  I don't mind if the ugly ones wrap up. 
[01:02:30]  I guess you wrap up facially completely.  They're two dumb eyes with shades on them.  There's something about Pelosi, though.  It just creeps me out.  She looks like, I was telling Ann in the office, she looks like the mother from What About Bob?  I don't remember.  Or the stewardess from Airplane.  But that's the younger version.  Oh, she has the same?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  She has those same, like, kooky eyes.  Crazy eyes.  Kind of like doll's eyes.  Old crazy eye Pelosi.  She should be forced to wrap up like the Phantom of the Opera.  Or the Invisible Man. 
[01:03:00]  And when she takes her hat off, she just unwraps and disappears.  There's no one there.  And Assad feels somebody tickling his neck slash bird chin.  It's like a mustache with an Adam's apple under it.  Get that fixed.  Almighty, they couldn't decapitate him.  They started cutting, like, at his mid-farhead.  I don't know what it is.  His far-headed shoulders.  Danny from Yonkers.  Yeah, how you doing?  I get to listen.  I never continually, because I do work.  Yeah.  Didn't you guys claim you had something to do with the Jerry Springer and the Dancing with the Stars? 
[01:03:30]  Ah, yes.  And I do believe we did.  First of all, not as many people vote for Dancing with Stars.  Second of all, we were on regular radio, which means we were reaching a hell of a lot more people  than Howard does.  A crap load more listeners.  And Jerry Springer came on our show and admitted that that's what was going on behind the scenes,  that there was an acknowledgment that we had something to do with it.  But we weren't able to, like, even with all those circumstances, we weren't able to keep  him on and actually win the whole thing.  Yeah.  Because I think other people also thought it would be funny to vote for Springer. 
[01:04:00]  I mean, this should have helped.  But other people would have thought it was a goof to vote for him, too.  Yeah.  I think it's two different scenarios.  It's American Idol you're talking about.  Millions of votes.  Right.  I say vote for Heather Mills.  She's going to go, like, pretty much all the way.  She should tap the third rail.  She's the stupid body of destroying one of the Beatles.  She's the Sanjaya or Sanjaya or whatever of Dancing with the Stars.  She's got all the attention.  I couldn't even tell you who else is dancing.  She's Sanjaya.  Name one other person that's dancing. 
[01:04:30]  I have no idea.  Exactly.  Mabel King.  No.  Name one other American Idol, Jimmy.  You know about Sanjaya, right?  Pete Stevens.  I know Melinda Doolittle.  I mean, I watch every week, so I'm up on it.  But how about Jimmy?  And Apollo Ono was dancing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you're right.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  I took your only person from Dancing with the Stars that you knew.  Oh, you were going to say that?  I got a picture with him.  He's that skater, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fruity skater.  All right.  Here's a...  I can't look at Mills, Heather Mills, dancing. 
[01:05:00]  I've not looked at anything but her leg.  Like, don't you just, when you watch it, you're just looking at her leg?  Mm-hmm.  That's it.  You don't look at what she's wearing, her head, her face, her hair, nothing.  Just that goddamn leg.  What do you say?  I guarantee it comes off in one of the things on purpose.  Oh, that would be great.  She keeps saying that's not going to happen.  She's going to pull it off at one point, and then, like, she's going to use it like a cane.  All right, cha-cha.  Hat.  Dun-dun-dun. 
[01:05:30]  Like an old vaudeville act.  She'll have a straw hat.  Put it on the wrist.  Hop, hop.  You guys are boring.  I hope she takes off her leg, holds it by the ankle, and takes out her partner like a baseball hat.  Oh, that'd be good.  Holds it by the fake ankle.  Right across his teeth.  Knocks him out cold on national TV and just goes,  Ta-da!  Ta-da!  Where she pulls off the leg off the stump, and she makes her partner eat potato salad out of the little lower you part that goes into the stump.  Yeah, there's some kind of tasty treat in there after they're finished dancing. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's either a potato or a macaroni salad.  She has chips under her wig, and they have a snack as McCartney sings, Help, and kills her.  All right.  Stern has more than 500,000 listeners.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah.  You believe that, George, in Pittsburgh.  Here's a quickie.  Parents want to name their kid Metallica.  A Swedish couple is fighting for the right to name their baby Metallica.  The couple wants to name their daughter after the legendary heavy metal band, 
[01:06:30]  but Swedish authorities rejected the application because it was associated with both the band and the word metal.  One official called the name ugly.  The couple said the name suits their baby because she's decisive and she knows what she wants.  So they're going to continue to fight for the right.  The name of baby Metallica.  Fight for the right.  Good.  That's kind of using an old Twisted Sister reference to get to a modern-day point.  Poor Beastie Boys.  Poor Beastie Boys.  Right.  Oh, I'm thinking if we're not going to take it.  I'm sorry.  All right.  You know what? 
[01:07:00]  I'm glad I didn't know that.  Beastie Boys.  Come on.  How can you not like the Beastie Boys, Jimmy?  I don't hate the Beasties.  They're unbelievable.  License Tale.  I thought it was a great album.  I like the old-school Beasties.  I'm not too hip on the new Beasties.  They're the Beastie old men.  Old Sabotage.  Is that considered old now?  That's considered old.  I like Sabotage.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  I liked it when Sabot did it in 75.  I'm just saying they stole the CD.  Whatever.  I'm just telling you.  Same with Sabot's CD.  You don't see Sabot doing License Tale, do you? 
[01:07:30]  You're hysterical.  Southern News.  They're filling up their time with all these goof stories today.  I had a real mood-killing vibe last night.  Yeah.  Can we tease that?  We certainly can.  Is it worth teasing?  I don't know if it's worth teasing, but I'll tell you what happened when we come back.  I hope I don't lose his nerve over the break.  Huh?  I hope you don't lose your nerve over the break.  Why don't lose my nerve?  I don't know, because you kind of mentioned it during the last break and was kind of like,  uh-huh.  I don't want to jump in at the wrong time. 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  I can't wait.  I love Jimmy's stories.  And what else are we doing today?  Talking about my Miami shows this weekend.  Oh, yes.  Coconut Grove.  Improv.  Improv.  What are we doing?  What else are we talking about today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Uh, venereal disease.  No!  It's a biggie.  Wow, we all have short-term memory problems.  No!  Talk about that.  Wait, wait, wait.  Um, can't look through the papers.  Georgia Man sentenced to life for raping daughter in a cemetery? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, that is a weird story.  We can talk about that when we get back.  That's actually the name of the show I pitched for Comedy Central.  Working title.  Oh, we have an addition to Vegas.  No!  We will mention that, though.  We'll come back.  My pal.  Yes.  They know, uh, they know, uh, out in Radioland.  They're screaming it.  Damn.  Uh...  Henry Winkler, PSA from 1984.  Oh, my God, how did I forget?  Henry Winkler, PSA from 1984, about child bowl estate. 
[01:09:00]  Good call.  You know, I knew you had a golden tidbit there.  You were smiling too much.  Featuring the song about your private parts.  This is wonderful.  Henry Winkler doing a PSA.  From 1984.  It's from 84?  Yeah.  Was Happy Days still on in 84?  Oh, yeah.  He's doing the whole...  Hey.  Hey, kids.  That was like some really bad Happy Days in 84, though.  That was the tail end of the run, wasn't it?  Yeah, all right.  For the shot, she was 41.  Are we doing this when we come back?  Because I'll spit mine out.  There's no...  There's no...  All right. 
[01:09:30]  Why don't you spit yours out?  Last night, my girlfriend came into the bedroom, dressed in very sexy lingerie, out of a shower,  looking lovely, and lay on the bed, and she started to touch my chest, and I was like,  you got to stop, because I had to take a dump.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I had to stop and go to the bathroom.  You ruined the moment.  I ruined it.  I atomic bombed it.  You're supposed to...  I was so embarrassed that I had to get up, because it was like that... 
[01:10:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You were gurgling and percolating?  Destroyed the vibe.  We got what she was thinking at that time.  I came back in 20 minutes later.  She was wearing sweatpants.  There goes that.  Watching Lifetime.  Oh, Jim.  You couldn't just hold it.  No, I couldn't.  I just...  What would you have done?  Now, how long have you two been going out? 
[01:10:30]  We started in, like, October, November.  We were friends for so long.  It's hard to say.  Wow.  We're trying to figure out a date.  We just don't know.  I'm just saying, you're at the point, still, where you should be able to just hold that  back.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  I couldn't.  Because, like, if I would have went, like, one, like, oh, like, a sigh.  Right.  Some pleasure.  It would have been...  You just lost it.  Yeah, I would have looked like a pudding rocket taking off being launched out of space.  Tub boy.  Tub boy.  Tub boy. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  Hey, it is really hot in here.  Anyone else?  Hot?  Blazing.  Thank you.  All right.  It's good.  I thought I had a disease.  God, a disease.  I was hoping that someone would agree with me.  I know.  Did you ever do that?  Hey, anyone else feeling hot?  No, actually.  It's cold, actually.  It's cold in my house.  I hate that.  It's, like, great.  Oh, great.  What symptom is this?  On an all-new house, one person's hot, the others are cold.  Can house solve this mystery?  Most exciting house ever. 
[01:11:30]  What?  I'm just...  I'm hot.  It's not real.  I don't need house.  Stop cutting me.  Only an infant's spine can cure him.  Yes, can cure him of his being hot.  He's always a little warmer than everyone else every day.  Sounds innocent enough.  Can house cure it by cutting off all his limbs?  What?  My limbs?  I'm just hot.  Could you turn the air conditioning on?  House doesn't know how to work a thermostat.  Oh, crap.  My grandmother was always cold.  It was so annoying. 
[01:12:00]  She said, why am I cold?  It's, like, because we make you sit around naked.  That's because parts of her were dying.  Oh.  Oh.  You just don't die in one big lump.  She's star-bott...  What?  I got a good laugh.  I ain't pushing it off.  I was thinking she's dying a piece of the time.  She goes to hug you and her right arm is good, and the left arm is just like a black tree limb.  Just hanging there while you're hugging.  Just cold and rotting.  Just rotting.  If you want to have fun today while you're out and about, look at old people and just kind of take notice of the parts of their body that are already dead. 
[01:12:30]  That are just rotting away.  Oh, there's a lot of them, man.  Fingertips.  Yeah.  You know, the hair, obviously.  The boobs, obviously.  I like the old ladies you see sometimes with the big cotton candy hair, but you could see right through it.  Yeah.  They've teased it up and hair sprayed it into one place, but you could see people right through it. 
[01:13:00]  You're like talking to your friend through her hair.  It's not even a distraction.  Hello.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  All right, we're just babbling.  Henry Winkler next.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  I just got wowed.  I got wowed.  I just got wowed.  Oh, thanks, guys, for being Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker, get flashed, get happy.  Details on.  God forbid we mention a website.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:30]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program.  I'm Jim Norton, possibly.  And I drove a deer or tated at me.  Really?  Did she just?  Yeah.  Why would?  See, that's interesting.  There are certain things you talk about on the air.  Yes.  And that was something that kind of got her a little.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just because, you know, your family's like, you know, possibly could be listening and they all know now that your boyfriend. 
[01:14:00]  It was just an unsexy lump who rushes to the toilet when you come in in the sexy lingerie.  It's kind of awful on every level.  Yeah, but see.  I got your point.  You should have just came up with some kind of weird excuse.  Like, you had to openly tell her what the problem was.  Oh, she.  Like, here's the thing, though.  There's no way around that.  Well, you're like laying there and she comes out of the shower and she has a little, little, I'm sure, or as I call it, just to give big laughs, lingerie.  You know.  Because it's like that.  Right, right.  Right.  Right.  And you're like, all right, I'll be back in 10 minutes. 
[01:14:30]  There's no way around that.  Why don't you just, getting a little romantic, and then you say something like, now you don't go anywhere.  I'll be right back.  That's right.  And then you get up.  Grab the paper.  Grab the paper.  I'm going to slip into something a little more comfortable.  Yeah.  Some toilet paper.  She has ears.  She can hear through the door.  How close is the bathroom?  It's in the bedroom. 
[01:15:00]  It's right there.  Yeah.  And there's another half bath.  But then you got to run.  Because I bought a porno.  I actually did buy a porno that she did not care for at all.  I swear to God, I just saw it.  It was called Raped in the Forest.  Oh, my God.  You can't bring home Raped in the Forest to your chick.  Yeah.  I just thought it would be kind of a fun domination movie, and she wanted to smash my face.  What's wrong with you?  Let's just say that there was a rake and an incident.  Yeah, it was awful. 
[01:15:30]  It was awful.  And did you continue watching?  All right.  Well, you go inside and watch something else.  I thought it was a comedy, I told you.  I was laughing and pointing.  Was it in the forest?  It was woods.  Oh, woods.  Two guys, three girls.  Well done, though.  Well done.  Yeah, I think it was Germany or something.  Can I film a vid?  A vid?  How was the dialogue?  Good?  I couldn't hear.  I heard just German guys going, oh, ah, over-the-top moaning.  They all sound like German soldiers dying in an old World War II movie. 
[01:16:00]  Ah, ah, whoa.  So, yeah, I really struck out sexually horribly last night.  I mean, I didn't think it would be.  I figured she would, like, not really love it.  But I'm like, yeah, maybe it would be sex.  A little domination.  Ugh.  Nothing, huh?  I was 0 for 2.  You guys, I hope you guys last.  Me too.  You guys are good together.  Make it work, Jimmy.  Make it work.  When I'm not penguin walking out while she has on lingerie.  Oh.  I'll be right back.  Pants around the ankles.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I saw you at Grindhouse. 
[01:16:30]  You guys looked adorable.  Pecking and stuff.  Noodling.  You know why?  Because in all the years I've known Jimmy, this is the first time you've been in a relationship  with a girl that we know and enjoy her company.  The rest of them.  She's nice.  We like her.  The rest of them.  You never want her to bring around.  I know.  And it would really be, you know, it would be sad for everybody.  I was afraid that if I brought my other girlfriends around, they'd do somersaults and their skirts 
[01:17:00]  would hike up and you'd go, wait a minute.  And I'd go, I didn't ever notice.  Yeah.  I tried to discriminate.  You'd rather us think that you were gay than bring your women around.  No, I don't.  I just, you guys had like, you guys were in real relationships and I hadn't been in a  real relationship in a while.  I dated some very nice girls, but I hadn't been in a relationship since Erin.  So now you got all of us involved.  See, you went and got us all involved in your relationship with your girl.  We all like her and everything.  And now you got to keep this thing going.  She swim walks.  She's a good girl.  She does this silly swim walk. 
[01:17:30]  Swim walk.  Yuck.  Well, it's high.  It's high.  Pound's not the way I stay physically fit.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  You sparked a little memory in Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hello?  What's up, Mikey?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love your show.  Good evening.  Yeah.  Speaking about, Jimmy's story is very familiar to me.  Me and my girlfriend are at the bondage and I had her handcuffed to my headboard and  I was pleasuring her orally.  Right.  I don't know about that. 
[01:18:00]  Hold on.  Let's just say.  You know what?  He doesn't know.  You had her handcuffed to the headboard and you were doing something that any gal would  like.  You don't even have to say any of that.  That you couldn't talk.  We've all been there.  Right.  We've all been there.  Maybe not with the handcuffs, but with the thing he's trying to explain.  So, Mike, it's simple as this.  She's handcuffed to the bed.  Right.  Let the imagination run wild in our listeners' minds.  I'm sorry.  What?  Yeah.  Just keep going.  I'll continue.  Now, watch this.  Heavy up. 
[01:18:30]  Go ahead.  So, I'm about...  A little uncomfortable, are you?  Yeah, well...  Yeah, well, there's only a million people listening now.  Go ahead.  Continue.  I'm about like three or four minutes in and I get the feeling in my stomach and I'm starting  to sweat.  And I'm like, oh, I'm not stopping.  I keep going.  And, you know, my body temperature just starts to drop.  So, I just left her there and I just...  I had to run.  I did a penguin run, just like Jimmy said.  You have to sometimes, man.  You got to get out of there because you have a choice. 
[01:19:00]  Do I want to kill this vibe?  The vibe is getting killed one way or the other.  Oh, there's an awful way.  Yeah.  It's either going to be...  It's going to be with me leaving this poor girl or it's going to look like a paintball  accident.  But the headline here, girlfriend was handcuffed to bed and you had to go to the bathroom and  you left her there.  You left her there cuffed.  Yeah, it was ridiculous, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mikey.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  You pulled it out in the end.  Congratulations.  Let's say hi to John.  By the way, FCC upheld the ban on cell phones on planes.  That's going to cut down on air rage. 
[01:19:30]  Thank you.  Because, let me tell you something.  Although, one thing is they always had those big phones, but I guess no one would use them  to spend the money.  The air phone.  How nice is it to be on a plane and not have to listen to other people's cell phones?  That's the biggest problem.  It has nothing to do with the instruments or anything.  And the FCC said it's more of a problem.  They were concerned with cell phones on the ground, it affecting cell phones on the ground.  I think they just said that.  The truth of the matter is it would interfere with people trying to sleep and relax and just 
[01:20:00]  the...  Watching a movie, just the dumb stuff you're doing on a plane.  And the flight crew trying to serve the passengers.  Like, it's bad enough that they're going down and they've got to take somebody's order and  they're on the phone holding their finger up like, oh, could you wait a second?  Right.  Meanwhile, you know, that happens a few times.  The last person that gets served doesn't get served for another hour later.  And that's all you want is some guy next to you?  Loud guy? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, I got the papers right here with me.  Been working on it.  We're on the flight.  We're scheduled to land at...  Who cares?  Shut up.  The second the plane lands, you hear like, beep, beep, all the phones turn on.  And you hear people start yapping.  I want to smack them in the head.  Shut up.  The air rage that would be going on with that would be a lot.  There'd be a lot of air rage over people on the phone.  You guys never commuted on a train.  It is beyond.  I have.  Beyond.  Yeah, I have.  What am I?  You don't really...  1800s?  No, you would come into the city to go see like Molly Hatchett or something. 
[01:21:00]  But you didn't like...  You didn't actually commute.  Dude, I've been to Washington on the Amtrak so many times with annoying people on their phones.  All right, good point.  You're right.  Yeah.  How do you think I get around riding fat girls?  I got to hop on the old subway.  Big boy takes a choo-choo.  Jimmy took a choo-choo for the first time in a long time yesterday.  All by himself.  Wow.  I went from 42nd to 72nd Street all by myself on the train.  Aw.  I could call my girlfriend.  Which one do I take?  You're a big boy now. 
[01:21:30]  Big boy took the choo-choo.  Yeah, you've been scared of the subway for a long time, right?  No, I'm not even scared of it.  It's just...  It seems like something I won't be able to learn, so I just take cabs.  But no, I was comfortable taking it.  Yeah.  Isn't it intimidating when somebody that knows the subway really well starts like somebody  goes, how do I get down to...  You know, I want to get down to 30th.  And they go, oh, well, you take the...  And they know all the letters and stuff.  I know nothing.  There's a subway station right out there.  I couldn't tell you what train line that is.  Our own Earl knows that. 
[01:22:00]  Earl is a pro at the subway.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I told this story.  It was a bunch of us hanging out one night.  I forgot where we were, a concert or just some dumb thing, maybe a sporting event.  I really don't remember.  But then we're taking the subway back uptown.  Isn't it strange?  No matter what train he's taking, it's always the N train.  And Earl, who knows the subways, and he's also a bit darker.  It's important to the story.  You got to laugh out there. 
[01:22:30]  They're still chuckling.  I'm just moving on to the next thing.  It's a damn good one, man.  Yeah, it's very good.  The N train.  So we're on a train.  It's a local, and it's stopping every, like, five, six blocks, right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, it's at 59th Street, and I think I was going in, like, 72nd, something like that.  So I'm thinking in my mind, I got two stops left, okay?  Out of nowhere, without giving me a warning, Earl steps off the train.  Earl's the subway Superman because he just knows all the letters. 
[01:23:00]  And he was going where I was going.  But he just steps off the train and assumes that I know the subways, and I will just follow him off.  But I'm, like, distracted looking at whatever, some dumb thing on the subway.  A rape?  I turn.  Right.  I turn.  Oh, my God.  We lost a great phone call because we're babbling.  So what?  They let them call back.  Yeah, they'll call back.  The person with the thing that happened while they were doing sex with the girl, you know, taking her clothes off, and then something happened. 
[01:23:30]  Please call back.  We really were going to you next.  This is good talk.  That call might have been, I did the thing.  So then I kind of, I happen to look up and turn to where Earl was sitting, and Earl's gone.  And I see him outside the subway as the doors are closing with him just going, no, like in slow motion.  I'm like, what could this possibly be?  You left your kid on the train.  Right, right.  There they go.  You just see him through the window.  The key is it was late.  It was probably 12, 31 o'clock in the morning, okay?  And he's out there, no, like maybe he could open the doors. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  And I'm like, what?  Earl, what could be the problem?  Uh-oh.  Where's the train go?  168th Street.  Oh, no.  Something like that.  It was like, yeah, it was like the, uh, what?  Jeez.  The Express.  The Express.  Thank you.  You know, I might have the streets a little off for the locals that know exactly, but it  went from like 59th Street all the way up to something like 168th Street.  I got off the train.  I was scared out of my effing mind.  Well, you should be. 
[01:24:30]  So what do you have to do?  Just go to the downtown area and hop back on it, right?  Yeah, but I had to wait, like, because it was late, like a long time, and there were  some, some cretins.  Some shady characters.  There was some shade on the, uh, on the platform.  Here's what you do.  This always works.  I'll always go, excuse me, I'm not from this part of Manhattan.  Could you tell me how to get back on the train and get back to where the hotels are?  I'm a little nervous because I'm carrying a very large sum of money.  Yes, my traveler's checks almost fell out.  But I'm a stupid white boy still on the subway, and there's Earl outside, like, doing everything 
[01:25:00]  you do to say no.  He's waving his hands like, oh, no.  I'm like, what?  How bad could this really be?  Earl's a pro.  What is the subway outside of 50, uh, by Columbus Circle?  They have everything on it.  Fanny, are you one of those guys?  You know all the subways?  Yes.  Ah.  People who are earlier in their careers are quite, uh, familiar with these subways.  Yeah.  So, Fannykins, if I want to take, if I want to get 72nd later, I'm going to get some  businesses on 72nd.  If I walk out of here and I get to Columbus Circle, I can just hop on down to the 2-3, 
[01:25:30]  the 1 maybe if I want to, but the 2-3 would be the express, but that doesn't probably stop  here.  It's not going to go to the 1.  Just say yes, because they don't care, West Palm Beach.  Yes, they do.  They don't care about this.  West Palm Beach, they're coming to see me in Miami.  Of course they want to make sure I'm okay.  Thank you.  Yes, for the show.  Bill in Waterford says 168th Street at 1 a.m.  Must have been floating teeth and eyeballs everywhere.  Why?  Why does it have to always go there?  Let's say hi to, uh, you.  Hi, you.  What's your name?  This is John in Jersey. 
[01:26:00]  Hey, John.  What's going on?  I'm up, guys.  I got a good killjoy story.  I had a girl one time who was trying to be real cute and fun, decided she was going to  do a little striptease for me.  I'm laying in bed.  She's standing over me.  She's taking off her chair, taking off her pants.  Next thing you know, the poor girl's staring straight up into a moving ceiling fan.  Oh, I'm telling you.  Were you banging, Vic Morrow?  The worst part of the story is, though, is it was so damn funny that the next morning  I had to go to work and tell my buddies about it. 
[01:26:30]  So I call the guys.  I'm the big funny guy at work the next day.  Two months later, one of these jerks decides he's going to get drunk at a party at my boss's  house and tell my fiancee, hey, guess what we heard you did?  Oh, she didn't speak to me for a month.  Yeah, they don't like when you tell the embarrassing stories.  And by the way, you should have stopped after the ceiling fan hit her head.  Yeah, believe me.  I just got to tell you.  They didn't want you to get the details.  As we were talking, I had to answer a text that said, no, I didn't mention the small animal  that we included.  Ah.  Ah.  Hmm? 
[01:27:00]  All right, guys.  Hold on, sir.  Let me soak in that bomb.  Just let it simmer.  Let it come to a slow boil and finish it off with it.  Yeah.  That was...  Okay, terrific.  I actually swung so hard on that one that I threw the bat down the third baselon.  That's your back.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Best clip.  I love that one.  Let's go to...  What's up?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[01:27:30]  A couple summers ago, I was dating this really cute blonde chick from NYU, man.  Yeah.  Everything was going great.  I don't know.  For some reason, we were in the middle of everything, and let's say she was on top.  All of a sudden, I feel something dripping, dude.  It was like runny number two.  You know what I mean?  That'll never make it, by the way.  Hey, you know what?  I give George an A for effort, though.  Yeah.  I tried, man.  That's okay.  George, A for effort, though.  That's right.  Let's just say you were being intimate with a girl. 
[01:28:00]  Let's try that.  Okay.  And she is in what they call the dominant position.  Ah.  You know?  Where you can maybe lay back and put your hands behind your head.  Ah.  That's exactly what...  And, uh...  The old headstand.  Yeah.  And, uh...  She may have not been feeling well.  Ah.  Not at all, man.  And, uh...  Can you say, ah, that this gentleman was dating Al Dukes?  He was dating Al Dukes because his girlfriend heard something she didn't like and had to dump out. 
[01:28:30]  Are you insane?  Why not?  That's what Al does.  Please let me know if that made it through.  Of course it made it through.  You think it did?  I know it did.  Brilliant, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Let's go to Sarah on Long Island.  Sarah!  I'm looking for my sister Sarah.  I'm on Florida Street.  Stupid, retarded Bill.  How do you remember Florida Street?  Shut up, Sarah.  We're having fun.  Okay.  So, um...  We're talking.  I'm having sex with my boyfriend. 
[01:29:00]  Ow.  And we were switching back and forth between different orifices.  If that were right.  Oh, yeah.  That's gonna...  That's...  That's...  Wow.  You know, we should do a whole show where the listeners try to get it right.  Yeah, that's gonna make the radio.  What?  You and your boyfriend...  I don't know how to put it.  Come on, guys.  I know we're...  As a radio show,  I know all of us,  including the hosts,  are so much smarter than this.  If you just say that you're...  You know,  you're getting intimate with your boyfriend or your husband,  then we just imagine all the crazy stuff going on. 
[01:29:30]  Well, you have to see...  We're going back and forth between a couple of different options.  You can say that.  There you go.  Yeah, options.  We were experimenting.  How is that?  We all know what happens when you get into a bed.  Yeah.  Experimenting.  Experimenting in a way where the girl goes,  ooh, that's nice,  and also,  ow.  Yes.  How about this?  Well, why would you poke her in the eye in the middle of that?  You got it.  Your nose is thinking this.  Flounder,  Staten Island,  flounder,  Staten Island,  flounder,  Staten Island,  flounder,  so he's on top. 
[01:30:00]  He's dominant,  and he's kind of...  Hold on,  hold on.  Bill from Waterford,  I can make it FCC-friendly for everybody.  The guy was blanking this chick,  and she took a blank on him.  I don't think the blank game works anymore either,  right, Aunt?  No.  They got rid of the blank game, too?  I think so.  Taking away all the great stuff we used to do on the radio to describe things.  Go ahead, Sarah.  Okay, so picture me in, like, a full crunch position.  Hold on.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  Okay, and I thought I farted,  and there was something more,  like, a lot more.  Do you mean spiritually?  Spiritually.  There was a lot more?  You know, I thought there was something,  but it was more, a lot more.  I found Jesus.  Yes, I thought it was a fart,  but it was just a Virgin Mary crying on the window chair.  All right, thanks.  Brought to you by the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints.  I don't know.  Did that make an answer?  You're more of an expert than I.  I doubt it.  Well, it's nice to know that that happened to Sarah. 
[01:31:00]  Look at that plane.  Look at that first class.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  He's sleeping in his own house.  Hey, sleeping in it like a frying pan.  Let's say hi to Newman.  Hey, how about Henry Winkler, by the way?  Hi.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with us?  If we forget Henry Winkler today,  I swear to you, I'm going to be very angry.  Wait, can we start it?  Because if we start it,  we have to break,  but if we start it,  that will get people to come back  because they might think that we're lying again.  All right.  Henry Winkler, The Fonz, 
[01:31:30]  a PSA from 1984 about child molestation  after the break.  But first, we got...  Newman.  Newman, what's up?  Yes, Newman.  This is why O&A shouldn't be on FM.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, someone really said that?  Yeah, but why?  Because some of the callers  can't describe certain situations properly?  Shut up.  I'll be good.  Not you.  You know what?  Who is that dummy, by the way, Ant? 
[01:32:00]  Newman.  Not you.  Oh, God.  Stupid Newman.  I like Newman now, though.  Yes, we've got to give Newman some credit for that.  Right, accurate.  At justifiably low self-esteem.  Yeah, hold on, Newman.  We'll get to your...  N-C-O-N-A fan.  So I guess North Carolina O&A fan.  N-C-O-N-A fan.  Shut up.  See, that's just dumb.  I think there's some value  in seeing if people could get some of this on radio. 
[01:32:30]  Of course.  And then we goof on the fact that they can't.  There's an entertainment value to it, you dope.  I like the split.  I like being able to say what we want  from a 9 to 11 at XM,  and I like the fact that we can get some fun  out of trying to do it here.  Yeah, it's absolutely...  What else am I going to say?  The best of both worlds.  How many times did we say that?  That's true.  We're like...  Newman, what's up?  Hey, you know, it's the best job in radio.  It's the best of both worlds.  We stink.  I didn't say that.  We stink.  We're soundbite hacks. 
[01:33:00]  Cliche asses we are.  Hey, we just want to try to make it work.  The best of both worlds, you know,  bird in the hand's worth two in a bush.  It's a dream come true for us.  It's a dream come true.  It's the best of both worlds.  You know, we're not putting all our eggs in one basket.  Shut up with your cliches.  Hey, my minutes are going to run out.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  What are you, in prison?  Where are you today?  You should have laughed at that.  Even I knew that was stupid.  Go.  All right.  Let's go, Newman.  I had an ex-girlfriend, 
[01:33:30]  and I heard her husband and her were playing around,  and she got an orange.  They were playing with fruit.  Okay, wait a minute.  And they played knock-knock,  and then she said orange,  and he couldn't get it,  and they got divorced.  No, I don't think they got divorced.  They did get divorced.  They weren't playing with bananas.  They were playing with oranges,  and it happened to get lodged in a certain spot,  and they had to go to the emergency room.  You mean orange? 
[01:34:00]  That was stuck in her.  Oh, you just blew it.  That's pretty funny.  You blew it.  You blew it right there.  I bet it was stuck.  Newman.  Whatever.  I'll bet you.  I'll bet you.  All right, Newman.  I bet it looked like Don Corleone at the end.  All right, Newman.  I'm hanging up on this junkie.  Stupid Newman.  Dude, I think he made it.  He made it right up to the end.  It's like running a great race,  and then falling down 10 feet from the finish line, 
[01:34:30]  and then he blows the whole thing.  Just think bedroom, orange, emergency room.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's all you have to say.  X-rays.  There you go.  We got one more,  but what do you got, Jimmy?  No, I'll do it as we go on a break.  Just a quick, quick, quick update.  All right, this is a good one.  This will make the air.  Chris in Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  All right, yeah.  Me and this girl were just having angry pig sex. 
[01:35:00]  All right, hold on, Chris.  Hold on.  That's nice.  That's beautiful.  Well, actually, I was the actual pig  because I was weighing about 250 pounds,  and she was about 98 pounds.  Yeah.  And about 15 to 20 of the pounds were actually her boobs,  but the rest of her body was just like bone and skin.  Yeah.  And, well, after I finished, I was like,  you never seen, like, the Discovery Channel  where the bear falls asleep on top of a female  and the female has to kick them off?  Yeah.  Well, she couldn't exactly kick me off 
[01:35:30]  because I was so freaking passed out.  I weighed too much.  Wait.  All right.  So she, huh?  Oh, go ahead, Chris.  Sorry.  Yeah, and I was so freaking drunk,  and I just passed out on top of her.  She was screaming for three hours.  She was trying to get the neighbors.  She was banging on the wall  so the neighbors tried to see her to get me off her.  Three hours, sir?  About three or four hours, yeah.  So she couldn't breathe for four hours?  Well, imagine if she could breathe 
[01:36:00]  because she's still alive.  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Bye, Chris.  Well, he's 250 pounds.  She was 98.  I'm kind of buying into it,  and then they did what they did,  and then he passed out,  and she couldn't get up for,  I don't think three hours,  but maybe an hour,  maybe a half hour, maybe 40 minutes.  Why don't you scratch your face  or dig her, you know,  and then he's not attacking her.  By the way, this is coming in.  Yeah.  Someone is acknowledging.  Is it, where is it?  It's Dr. Steve, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Yesterday, you guys talked to Quentin Tarantino.  Today, you're talking to people  that had something happen.  I can't say it.  During sex, yeah.  That's the beauty of what we do.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Wonderful, wonderful Las Vegas virus tour update.  Mm-hmm.  Finally, Patricio Neal.  Patrice is confirmed for the Vegas show,  as he should be.  Yes.  Not because he's so great on the show  or because we love him,  but because he's black.  That's the only reason  we don't want to have a racist tour. 
[01:37:00]  He should be on these shows.  He's a tremendous part of the whole thing here.  He certainly is.  He's sitting in for you on Friday, matter of fact.  Good.  He's been added to the O&A traveling virus.  Absolutely good.  In Vegas, at the Joint,  at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino,  April 14th.  And I've heard about some very good comics  that will be accepting some dates.  Yeah?  Yes.  Oh, very good.  And then we've got to promote the strip club  that's helping us out.  Vegas is all over it.  Yeah, it's called the Spearmint Rhino,  and they signed on to provide girls 
[01:37:30]  for the press conference,  and they're going to dance on stage for the show.  So I think that there's supposed to be  like one of the hottest strip clubs in Vegas,  which is the Spearmint Rhino,  which I might be going to one night.  I don't go to strip clubs,  but this one I actually want to check out.  Okay.  And hopefully get a lap dance  and get thrown out.  How great would that be  if they're sponsoring the tour  and Jimmy gets thrown out of the joint?  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, I guess the webpage is  SpearmintRhino.com.  It's probably just a bunch of strippers,  which is always good on a webpage.  Yeah.  All right.  You better go to my MySpace  and see my photo 
[01:38:00]  where I'm Annoying Sabbath.  I'd say go to SpearmintRhino.com.  Just me, four real men.  And all the info is up on the website.  Yes.  And for the pests out west  that are going to join us,  you might want to check out  the press conference  by the pool during the afternoon.  That's where we'll announce  all the other cities  and the comedians  and all that stuff.  All right.  But April 14th,  we kick off the  ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour  in Vegas.  When we get back,  they're yelling at us  for the feedback.  They're just screaming at us. 
[01:38:30]  I want to hear it.  Henry Winkler,  The Fonz,  a PSA from 1984  about child molestation.  If we all focus,  we could do this next.  Let's do it.  We will do it.  All right.  I love showing my  introverted fat guys  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Hear what everyone else  is talking about.  ONA Uncut and live  continuing the show  on XM Satellite Radio  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com  to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Sunday, Monday,  Tuesday, Friday,  Tuesday, Friday,  Tuesday, Friday, Friday,  Tuesday, Friday, Friday, Friday,  Whoa, Chachi.  Is someone touching you  where your bathing suit covers?  Whoa.  Hey.  This is wrong.  Right.  What's Mr. C trying to do  with his pinky Tuscadero?  Hey.  His new nickname for Joanie  is short memory. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, feels so right  it can't be wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like Chuck  was only in the first season.  He has a little incident  at the school.  There was a problem  on the set.  They had to get rid of him.  Sharing a room  with Mark Parento now.  Unhappy days?  Unhappy days.  Happy days.  Saturday.  Yeah.  You promised nothing.  Proving all week with you.  Oh.  These days are home. 
[01:40:00]  You'll never remember them.  We're back with  the Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  There's another call coming in?  Oh, my God.  What's up, Kurt?  There'll be gunfire.  What's up, Kurt?  Hey, I was just with my girlfriend  the other night  and I'm kind of kicked back  and she's  and the next thing I know  it's got to be my turn  so then I start  and then I start  going  at her pretty heavy  and we're really  and the next thing  she gets this crazy look  on her face  and there's  everywhere.  I just couldn't believe it. 
[01:40:30]  You just...  Yeah, yeah.  It's time.  He gets the slow clap.  All right, God.  Woo!  You go, Kurt!  No, but the thing is  that was no good  because, dude,  you kept hitting your phone  and I couldn't understand  what you said.  Yeah, what are you trying to do?  Effing Kurt.  This is a very rare thing  but you did it today. 
[01:41:00]  You have started  something new, my friend.  That's good.  I like that one.  If we didn't have  a short-term memory problem  on the show  we would even call it  the Kurt bit.  Yeah, but we'll just take it.  Thank you.  Maybe the listeners  if they can remember  go, hey, I'm going to do  the Kurt bit.  Very good, sir.  That's good.  They have their own beep.  They sure do.  Every caller has their own  potential beep  that they can censor  their calls with.  That's right.  Tell your story  walking, Al.  That's right.  We could fire Al finally. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Al's on his way out.  You've been replaced.  Finally get him back  for that.  You're redundant.  Finally get him back  for that little St. Patsen.  Yeah, who was riding  the button that day, Al?  Exactly.  Who was there that day?  All right, Kurt.  All right.  Let's go into  Henry Winkler.  Yeah.  Let's do a little  Henry Winkler.  Henry.  So what is this?  Does anyone know?  1984?  Yeah.  What did he do wrong 
[01:42:00]  that he had to do this?  It's a PSA  on Child Molestation  from Henry Winkler.  You know what's horrible?  I was watching TV  and you know how  all these shows  have these reunion shows  like Happy Days  and whatnot?  Yeah.  Happy Days  had their show,  but apparently Henry Winkler  went around with a camera  the whole time  like filming  what was going on  behind the scenes  and their softball games  and little things like that 
[01:42:30]  and I was like  all right,  that kind of sounds interesting.  Like here's a show  that was on for years,  very popular.  I'd like to see  how they interacted  behind the scenes  and stuff.  He took the most  boring home movies.  It was like sitting  watching your aunt's  home movies.  Yeah, okay.  It was horrid.  What did you think  was going to happen  that Marion Ross,  he was going to be  filming a car  and you were going  to see a black gentleman  and all of a sudden  Marion Ross' head  popped up out  of the passenger seat?  Why couldn't you?  Turn that off, Henry.  I'm trying to shame  my father, Henry. 
[01:43:00]  Maybe Potsy and Ralph Mouth  being pulled over  by the cops.  Mouth not stopping.  They get arrested.  Let's go to Chuck  in Glen Cove.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Open up, Anthony.  Love you.  Love the show.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fonzie,  it feels so right  you can't be wrong  because Fonzie  is an older guy  who hangs out  in the bathroom  and of course  younger boys  in the bathroom.  Yeah, he calls  the bathroom  my office.  Yeah, that was  a little weird, right?  Cunningham,  step into my office.  Did you just say it?  Did you? 
[01:43:30]  Without beeping  yourself, sir?  You had the cleanest  story of the morning  and you had to blow it  by just throwing  the curse in there  in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah, he did.  Way up on the quota.  Well, let's hear  some of this PSA.  We haven't heard any.  Thank you, Chuck.  Yeah, got to hear it.  You had a great day.  But that's a good observation.  He's hanging out  in the bathroom  with the boys.  Wow.  Because they were all  supposed to be only  in what, high school, right?  Yeah, that's a joke.  Not much of a joke was that.  That's when it started.  Yeah, Richie was like bald. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  Had a mustache.  In his 30s.  Still getting it.  I'm a sophomore next year.  Right.  Are you?  In his 30s getting  sex advice from  Henry Winkler  in a bathroom.  The hell was that about?  Howard ran a hardware store  and sold Richie a gildo.  Let's hear the audio.  All right, here we go.  Fonzie introduces you  to Henry Winkler.  Oh.  What?  Is this like your bit?  Is this the bit  when Opie introduces  Greg Hughes, 
[01:44:30]  the actor that plays Opie?  It's not a bit.  Well.  I'm Greg Hughes,  the actor that plays Opie  on the Opie and Anthony show.  There's no bit there.  That's a good point.  Now, I'm thinking  if this happened in 84,  I'm thinking maybe  hoo-hoo-hoo.  He tells us  we're going to learn  about what to do  to prevent molestation  and abduction.  Then, for some reason,  Fonzie threatens  to run over  the children's knees  with his bike  if they don't sit there  and enjoy themselves.  He's threatening.  The best part of these bits  is how the guy  set it up with the...  Oh, this is horrible.  ...with the writing  of the tracks. 
[01:45:00]  By the way,  we can't take credit  for this.  Laszlo turned us  on to this.  Oh, really?  Laszlo,  and he's working  on the new GTA,  you know, 4.  Yep.  A lot of controversy  with the trailer  because it's set  in New York City  and the politicians  blah, blah, blah,  aren't happy,  blah, blah, blah.  All upset.  What, what?  Opie.  What?  What?  Opie.  What?  I want to hear it.  Thank God for Jimmy.  Jimmy just won't  stop pounding away.  I can't...  I have to hear this.  Don't change the subject.  All right.  Hey, would you listen 
[01:45:30]  to that beautiful  chorus of voices?  Thanks, kid.  And now I'd like you to...  Sounds like Tony Danz.  Yeah, what Fonzie is that?  He can't do it  when he's not on set  or something?  Did they franchise out Fonzie  and that's like  a different guy?  Hey.  Hey, would you listen  to that beautiful  chorus of voices?  Thanks, kid.  It's Rocky meets  Tony Danz.  Hey.  Hey.  Sounds like Fonzie.  Huh? 
[01:46:00]  Nothing.  I don't know.  Nothing.  It's a little joke.  Hey.  Looking good, sports fans.  Does anybody remember  last year?  I should have put it 
[01:46:30]  on my own.  That's the way  I do it.  I guess I should have  done that one.  Yeah, what's his name?  Fagsy?  Wait, we've got...  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How did that not go in?  Speaking of hockey,  stupid Islanders.  Back goes Griffey  looking up  and it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Yeah, your mistake, all right.  Back to this weird version  of Fonzie.  Yeah.  And now I'd like you  to meet a very good friend 
[01:47:00]  of mine.  We're almost flesh and blood,  you know?  Joey, in case you...  This is Henry Winkley.  Hey, take a bow, Henry.  Hi, I'm very glad to see you.  Who's the little Jew?  Ew, what a tool.  He introduced himself.  I am squirming,  literally squirming  in my seat.  I cannot take stuff  like this.  Take a bow, Henry.  Take a bow, Henry.  Hi.  Hi, I'm Henry Winkley.  Don't hurt me.  Oi.  Oi.  Fonzie belts him 
[01:47:30]  in his face.  Yeah, Fonzie makes Henry  eat a urinal mint.  Beat it, sissy.  What a bummer it was, though.  Most of us grew up  kind of like  looking at Fonzie  like, wow, he's cool.  Because you're too young  to really understand  how hardcore he is.  But then Henry Winkler  would like show up  on a show  and he'd be like,  oh my God,  that's the guy  that plays Fonzie?  Well, I'm doing  a new movie  trying to break character.  He was a little  white in the wolfers  when he wasn't  playing Fonzie.  He was a little  white in the wolfers. 
[01:48:00]  Four foot eight  comes strutting out  on the Tonight Show  and you're like,  what the,  who is this guy?  With his blow-dried hair.  All feathered.  He's like, ugh.  Yeah.  Why would you ever admit  that this is how  you really walk around?  Hear the intro again.  Yeah, I gotta hear  the intro again.  My friend,  take a bow.  Take a bow.  You used to be  in that position.  Bye.  Sounds like Sam.  Thanks, kid.  Bye, Fonzie.  Hey, would you listen 
[01:48:30]  to that beautiful  chorus of voices?  Thanks, kid.  And now I'd like you  to meet a very good  friend of mine.  We're almost flesh and blood,  you know.  Mr. Henry Winkler.  Hey, take a bow, Henry.  Hi, I'm very glad  to see you.  Bye, Fonzie.  And I'm very glad  to see you.  And I'm very glad  to see you.  Ooh.  So let's take charge.  Wow.  You're cool.  Huh?  So here we are,  parents and children together.  We're gonna learn  about each other,  we're gonna learn  about ourselves, 
[01:49:00]  and what to do  to prevent sexual abuse  and abduction.  We got a lot of surprises  for you along the way,  so sit there,  enjoy yourself.  Surprises.  Or I'm gonna run over  your knees with my bike.  What?  What?  Wow.  And he goes,  hey, little A,  I'm gonna run over  your knees with my bike.  It's funny.  No one screams  except a little girl  named Heather M.  Who lost one  in a motorcycle wreck. 
[01:49:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Ooh.  That's terrible.  He couldn't even  commit to his E.  E.  Why didn't Fonzie  just do the PSA?  You'd rather hear  Fonzie telling you  how to avoid certain things  than...  No, you needed  a father figure, Jimmy.  A creepy Henry Winkler.  Right.  Who do kids listen to more?  I'm gonna teach you  how to do your taxes.  With his Perry Winkles  sweater  and Perry Winkles shirt.  Oh, this is the video  where...  With the collar  popping out.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got a purple collar.  He really...  He looks like a kid toucher.  He looks like a queer.  He's giving him 
[01:50:00]  awful advice.  Here's how you avoid it.  And he pulls up  these little tight  like spandex shorts.  You wear these.  And you run around  shirtless through the sprinkler.  God almighty.  You want to hear  the next track?  How can we not?  It's the greatest thing  I've ever seen  better than...  All right.  Henry introduces us  to his friends  including...  Beware a nude man  who are straddling  the end of a slip and slide.  Whoa! 
[01:50:30]  Put on your knees  at my bike.  Fuck you.  Oh, it's just  potty mouth day.  It's infected the studio.  Jimmy just drops  the F-bomb.  I just did that  because it's the FCC, man.  I won't tolerate it.  Yeah, you're a rebel.  That was great.  You just dropped  the F-bomb.  Bird in Philly.  One of his catchphrases  was sit on it, right?  Sit on it. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, sit on it.  Telling all the  neighborhood kids.  Hey.  Sit on it.  Hey, sit on it, nerd.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  It's not gay  because I'm the F-bomb.  Hey.  Hey.  We got...  We got three places to sit.  We got my thumbs.  My thumbs.  One on each thumb.  Thumb.  All right.  Or Al's nose.  Al.  Al Delvecchio.  Oh, if you were 
[01:51:30]  a size queen.  Didn't he look like  Andrew if he wasn't  retarded with a bigger nose?  Big A, yeah.  Yay.  Happy, happy, happy.  Ah.  This is a part  of Celebrity Special.  What?  Oh, forget it.  All right, let's go to this.  Yeah.  Next clip.  There are a couple of friends  I'd like you to meet.  Saul Gordon,  whose life's work it is  to keep families family.  Hi.  This is a program  for families.  Don't forget Chris Wallace.  And me,  Marriott Hartley. 
[01:52:00]  Hi.  Me too.  John Ritter.  Hey, hello.  Uh-oh.  Wait, hold on.  Is this a PSA  on how to avoid  just breaking  your family's heart  behind a sofa  on the set of  a second-rate sitcom?  Three's company.  Two's awake.  Oh, my God.  Leave him alone.  Come collapse  on our floor.  Holy Jesus. 
[01:52:30]  That is not right.  That is horrible.  We will do the dump report  today over at the other joint.  Yeah, it's been close to the can.  Yes.  Well, I tell you,  if it's got Marriott Hartley  in it,  it's got to be good.  She's terrific.  What was she in Marriott Hartley?  Nothing.  For anybody under the age of 71  who might be playing this program.  She's, like, famous 
[01:53:00]  for just being around.  She did, like,  what?  The Polaroid commercials,  and before that,  I just remember  she was in an episode  of Star Trek.  She looked pretty good in that.  Yeah.  It was downhill all the way.  She wasn't a star  of a show or something,  or movies?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We're running out of time.  Damn it.  If these clips are won.  Come on.  Play them.  E.  Hello.  Oh.  What was that?  Down there in front. 
[01:53:30]  Tally what?  What?  Ding dong.  Tally locker.  It says across the screen.  That's coming up.  Oh, that's coming up?  Yeah, that's the song.  They sing a little song.  Oh, they do.  Oh, we're up to the song.  Are they going to dump out of this?  No.  It's an 84 PSA  done by Fonzie.  Yeah.  And it was sung to kids,  so it should be okay.  This is a song about your,  you know.  Yeah.  Your throat?  Well.  Well.  Depends on the gentleman's preference. 
[01:54:00]  Penis  is what boys have down in front.  Penis  is the word,  though it seems blunt.  Wait, stop.  Oh, oh.  And the girls have a...  Oh, all right, all right.  I thought we were in trouble there.  I thought he was going to rhyme something.  It's what the boys have down in front.  And by the way,  your mother really is acting...  What?  Who's singing?  Anyone?  Danny?  Ah, hold on. 
[01:54:30]  There you go, Danny.  I think it's that Saul guy  that they introduced earlier.  I was very injured.  And I don't know if it was mentioned,  but the reason that you hear all these wacky sounds  and like everything's cutting away strange,  that's like not me editing that together.  That's how it actually aired.  And I think,  I don't know if you guys have ever seen the show  Wonder Showsen.  It's like this really weird, strange cartoon,  but this was definitely,  the premise for that show  was completely lifted from this PSA.  Really?  Yeah, the production of that show,  almost identical to this exact PSA.  What was the context to this?  Like, where did it play? 
[01:55:00]  How did it play?  Was it before or after a show?  Was it a half hour special?  Was it,  does anyone know?  I don't remember seeing it as a kid.  I can't imagine.  No, I definitely don't remember seeing this.  And this seems like something I would know about.  Wow.  I think, yeah,  it was something snuck into the cartoon hour  in the afternoon  because I definitely remember seeing this.  And that guy with the...  Because that's a little risque  playing a penis song like that.  He's got overalls on  as he's singing this creepy song  with a small guitar.  What a ghoul.  I thought that was a kid.  No, that's the guy singing this song. 
[01:55:30]  Let's hear the rest of the song.  By the way,  for, you know,  you throw strong kids,  safe kids in a search engine,  you'll see the video for yourself.  And he's sitting on a big slide.  He's sitting on top of a slide.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here's the word,  though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis,  so no matter what you've heard,  remember that penis  is the proper word.  Vulva  is what girls have down below.  Even though most people call it vagina  and some children call it Virginia. 
[01:56:00]  Vulva  When she's naked,  it will show  Oh my God!  What?  This is...  Are you...  This is the worst...  The worst.  ...example of like  a PSA against...  What the hell are they thinking?  This is just getting...  They were all on the dope.  This is a hit.  This is getting everyone  worked up into a...  Yeah, this is like...  It's like pedophiles  would play this on their iPods now.  This should be on the...  This should be playing 
[01:56:30]  on the good humor truck.  This is horrid.  That's a real attention grabber, though.  When the opening line  of the song is penis,  you're like,  you know what?  I'm sticking around.  All right, let's see  with the next verse.  Hold on, honey.  Just don't turn the channel yet.  I gotta see what comes up next.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Vulva.  When she's naked,  it will show.  All girls have a vulva,  so no matter what you've heard,  remember that vulva  is the proper word.  Our anus  is a useful thing indeed.  The anus 
[01:57:00]  gives relief  in time of need.  We all have an anus,  so no matter what you've heard,  remember that anus  is the proper word.  So don't be appalled  because that's what they're called.  And each of them's  the proper word  for private pause.  The radio is discomfort.  My God, man.  There are so many jokes in there. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, my God.  There's song lyrics  that I could just think.  And I have a feeling  in about 30 minutes or so  that song is going to get played again.  Yeah, I think we play that again  over the next time.  Why don't we...  Put on your thinking caps, boys.  Got a half hour  to figure that out.  That's the proper word.  And if you put your penis in it,  you'll come back with a turd.  I had to do it.  That's got to do that.  What?  What?  I think we may have seen  part of the dump list right there. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We got three more clips to play  before we get out of here  for today.  We have  Nobody's Supposed to Touch  Your You-Know-What.  Yeah.  Fonzie's Rule.  We learn what Fonzie's Rule is.  And then Fred Flintstone  gets involved.  Volvo.  It's the safest car indeed.  Volvo.  Might as well crash myself.  Volvo, it's cool.  Good for catching seed. 
[01:58:30]  And then we end.  And then we end  if we come back with this.  A song called  You Are Never to Blame.  Oh.  God, I thought  how great it would be  if it would be  You Are Always.  You Are Never to Blame  and then parentheses  Yes, You Are.  All on the way  from the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Herbie and Anthony  just got me wild.  I just got wild. 
[01:59:00]  We tell you  how to get a wow sticker  but we can't  plug the website.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  I'm Opie and I love you.  Oh.  Anthony, your turn.  What?  Say whatever you want.  Hey.  How you doing?  What's going on?  That's it?  What am I going to  profess my love to who? 
[01:59:30]  The listeners.  Hey, I don't want to hear it.  They do though.  No.  I, Greg Opie Hughes,  love you.  I, I, I like you.  I don't love you  in the way where, you know,  where we got to do stuff together.  Where they got to sing songs  about it.  Right.  About various parts.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus  spreading across America.  I'm a little uncomfortable  as I sit here.  Oh, no.  You need a little belly massage?  Oh, boy, do I.  I need something squeezed out.  Oh.  Maybe a little push. 
[02:00:00]  You know, push it down.  Really?  The rest of the toothpaste out.  All of a sudden  the red October's on the floor.  Our phone number  1-866-313-FREE.  What do you want to do?  More Henry.  Isn't there more?  Henry what?  Henry Winkler.  Huh?  Remember?  We were doing it.  Don't even start.  Don't even start.  Henry Winkler.  Henry Winkler  doing the PSA.  Oh, the Fonz, yeah.  Oh, the Fonz, right.  We can do that tomorrow?  No.  No.  It's on.  I can see the part of the video 
[02:00:30]  and we're continuing.  All right, let's do that.  By the way, really fast.  And this is something  that's been brought up  all morning long  on Instant Feedback,  some phone calls.  We haven't been able  to get to it today.  But people are starting  to check to see  if we've made our video yet.  Oh, they're looking around, huh?  They're starting  to look around around.  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  People are saying,  those people being  Anthony and I  from yesterday's program,  late in yesterday's program,  we will be making 
[02:01:00]  a video very, very soon.  Yeah, a little video  can end up on  all the usual sites,  you know,  YouTube,  Break,  whatever other video sites  want to pick it up.  And it's going to be a video.  Yeah.  It's going to have us in it.  Yeah.  Describing  something you people  can get involved in.  One of a series of videos  from your pal's opiate answer.  It's going to be a series.  Possibly a little Jimmy Norton.  Well, if I can't be a part  of that video, 
[02:01:30]  I'll certainly do something  in line with the Henry Winkler.  I'll make a video like that for you.  Example.  So basically,  I can't confirm or deny  the fact that we may be  hiding cold hard cash  in Manhattan somewhere.  Actually hiding it  somewhere in Manhattan.  There could be a large sum  of money hidden somewhere.  I think that's safe to say.  And a video may start  the whole thing.  Yeah.  It could be.  It would be a video 
[02:02:00]  where you see Ant and I  and just details from there.  A hot tub.  But people were paying  attention yesterday  and they're already searching  to see if the video  is out there yet.  No, it's not out there yet.  Okay?  Hopefully in the near future.  Okay.  In the future.  In Jersey.  Pat, what's up?  Pat.  What's up, Pat?  That last skit, man,  with the Fonz,  I almost crashed my car.  Hey, you don't crash your car.  That's right.  It's not done yet. 
[02:02:30]  We got more Henry Winkler.  I want to hear more.  Yeah, we're done.  No.  No.  Dude, I'm going to crash, man.  It's just too fucking...  Oh, my God.  There is some kind of sickness  going around today.  What is up?  Where people just can't stop  dropping that F-bomb.  I love it.  It's amazing.  All right.  Ruben from New York,  then we'll get back into it.  Ruben.  Ruben Kincaid.  Yeah.  Oh, uh...  Back in fifth or sixth grade,  they didn't hear that on TV. 
[02:03:00]  We had to get permission slips  from our parents.  And we got all pulled into the cafeteria  and watched this.  Is that what the kids in 84  were getting as their, like,  sex ed thing?  Remember they used to drag us in  and show us horrible  black and white films of...  And here is the male genitalia.  Young boy shaving?  Yeah.  You're going to grow hair  in certain areas  and maybe you'll need  deodorant and hygiene.  Yeah.  And this was like the... 
[02:03:30]  Well, you talked.  Go ahead.  Every time I try to say something,  you just babble over it.  You go right ahead.  Go ahead, Ruben.  It's all about you, Ruben.  Go.  I guess you're also syndicated  in 25 cities  and heard in two countries.  Go ahead, Ruben.  What do you got going on?  Right now.  It's all about you.  You're on, Ruben.  You're on.  Go.  You can take the show.  I'll let you go.  No, no.  Go ahead.  You drove the bus.  You did a good job.  You were a hell of an agent.  You got the partridges booked.  See, as it wasn't getting last,  I decided to explain it  more and more.  Let's go, Bob.  The bus.  All right, let's go.  Here we go.  He's driving a baseball team.  If you're just tuning in,  wow, look at that.  They drove off the bus. 
[02:04:00]  The bus went.  Oh.  The wheels on the bus.  Go.  You're ending me.  No time.  Over on the highway.  Whipping Mount Wednesday  is alive and well  on Pal Talk this morning.  Thank you to all the fine ladies  that are wowing  or maybe one girl.  No, there was a  African princess  that was wowing earlier.  Okay, here we go.  Henry Winkler,  the Fonz, PSA from 1984,  84 about child molestation.  We're up to 
[02:04:30]  nobody's supposed to touch  your you-know-what.  Yeah.  Nobody is supposed to touch  your private parts.  Period.  No.  Don't touch me like that.  Stop it.  Stop.  If you don't,  I'm going to tell my dad.  You know I really like you,  but I don't like the way  you touch me.  No.  Did you ever hear  anything like this?  Your mommy and daddy  would never love you again 
[02:05:00]  if you told this.  You're so bad,  you might never get  another hug.  You might have to  grow up alone.  Grow up alone?  I knew I wasn't wrong  to say that.  How else are you  going to shut  the little snitch up?  Wow, that acting.  The acting is just  beyond brutal.  Yeah, this is really bad.  It's a puppet?  Yes.  It's a sock puppet?  It's a sock puppet snake. 
[02:05:30]  It's with a lady  who has hair like  Leif Garrett.  Yeah, I see  what's going on there.  Yeah.  All right.  Fonzie's rule.  We get to hear  what Fonzie's rule is.  Hey, Fonzie's rule.  Yeah, but there you go.  There's some of the scenarios  that you might encounter.  What's Fonzie's rule?  That's a whole thing.  Here we go.  Fonzie's rule.  Fonzie's rule.  Now, listen.  We don't use no  when you got to go to school,  do your chores,  make your bed, 
[02:06:00]  go to sleep, dig it?  If a stranger  offered you  an ice cream stalactite  to come into his cave,  would you go?  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's over the top.  Fred.  Now, Fred's  fake Fred's gone too far.  It is fake Fred, too, huh?  Oh, it's stupid fake Fred.  How disappointing.  The guy that did  the real Fred voice  died, like, years ago,  but they kept  Fred Flintstone going,  and that voice  you just heard  was fake Fred. 
[02:06:30]  If someone offers you  an ice cream stalactite,  hey, Barney,  and Dino,  Wilma,  that's not Fred's voice.  It's not the Fred  we grew up with.  It's phony fake  fake Fred Fred.  Fred Flintstone stinks.  The old original  Flintstones I liked,  but I can't stand  fake Fred voice.  Hey there, Barney.  What?  And now he's talking 
[02:07:00]  about child molestation.  Invites you into a cave?  I'm, uh,  well,  rock, uh, what?  But I am  Rock Quarry.  Yeah, Rock Quarry  was the kid toucher.  I'll tell Fred  he has to go out,  and I'll stay  with Pebbles.  Pebbles.  What have you done  with Pebbles?  Oh.  Ten minutes.  You might remember me  from this porno. 
[02:07:30]  Jaws,  make your bed,  go to sleep,  dig it?  Yeah, dig it.  If a stranger  offered you  an ice cream stalactite  to come into his cave,  would you go?  Don't fall for that line.  Ow.  Yabba-dabba-doo.  So he's saying  you should go.  Yabba-dabba-doo.  That means go.  Yabba-dabba-doo it.  That's what he gets  on him  when he's done.  Little yabba-dabba-doo.  Dabba-doo-dabba-doo. 
[02:08:00]  Harriet Hartley's here.  Oh, good.  I'm sure she'll have  something poignant.  I think she's here  to intro the song  You Are Never to Blame.  Okay.  Ew.  You are never to blame.  You are never to blame.  You are never to blame.  They show a little crying kids.  You may feel shame  but all the same  You are never to blame. 
[02:08:30]  Look at Nathaniel  singing this song.  You are damaged goods.  Wait.  They told you  to stay out of the woods.  So what happened to you  happened because it should.  Even though you're not to blame  you were dressing  kind of sexy that day.  He wanted me  the next Jim Croce  singing these awful songs.  That is awful.  Sounds more like  Harry Rapin. 
[02:09:00]  It's kind of corny.  A little corny.  And Chester's liver  has a Bam Bam joke  so there you go.  Oh my God.  Peaches and cheese.  Opie, please stop  saying molestation.  It's...  Oh, stop.  Pronounce it both ways.  There's no one.  It's fine.  Molestation.  It's molestation.  I always said molested.  You say molestation.  It's one of those  that could go either way.  Thank you, man.  Of course.  Thanks for finally  sticking up for me.  Don't be fancy. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  Anytime once a year.  You are never to blame.  Self-respect is cruel  and so are you.  Hey.  Oh.  Look at that smorgasbord  he's got to choose from.  Yeah, I bet you  this went over well  in Compton High School.  Yeah, I know.  A bunch of white kids.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Is that it?  That's pretty much it.  What about John Ritter?  What about him? 
[02:10:00]  What did he say?  He's dead.  I know, but he didn't  say anything.  He had to have.  What did John Ritter say?  Someone call 911.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hi.  My name is John Ritter  and if a man wants  to touch something  that rhymes with my last name  tell him no.  All right.  Get it?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Oh, I'm punchy and tired. 
[02:10:30]  I'll apologize  to the listening audience.  No, it was a fine show.  We got a quickie  before we leave here.  Okay, Barney.  Well, it was a long flight  to Hawaii  and it was made  even longer  for some Delta passengers.  A rowdy passenger  forced the flight  from Cincinnati  to land in San Francisco.  She apparently  got very upset  after she was caught  smoking in the bathroom.  The pilot had to leave  the cockpit  to try to calm her down.  The pilot was talking 
[02:11:00]  to her  and she was screaming  and she said,  I require Vicodin  for seizures  that I have  and I have to have it  so that I don't have  the seizures  and it was prescribed medicine.  She didn't really weigh in  on the smoking part of it though.  Well, the passenger  was removed from the plane  in San Francisco  and taken to a hospital.  She should have had her face  slapped so hard  that a couple of teeth fell out.  I've jonesed like that  for a cigarette  on a plane  and I do empathize  with smokers.  There's a panic 
[02:11:30]  you go through  when you're jonesing  for a cigarette.  Anthony, you know,  I mean, you've smoked  back in the older days.  It's awful.  That's what it was.  She was jonesing  for a cigarette.  A small detail there  is that she punched  the pilot  for some reason.  Oh, that didn't make  the story?  Well, when you punch  the pilot,  yeah, then there's a problem.  She got upset  that she wasn't allowed  to smoke  so she punched  the pilot.  You know what I don't  understand?  Never punch the pilot.  Why, when something  like this happens  on a plane,  why do they have to  land immediately  or turn the plane around?  Why can't they, like, 
[02:12:00]  figure out a way  to just, like,  freaking restrain you?  Get us to our airport,  please.  Why do we all  have to suffer?  Because of lawsuits  if something happens  along the way  and a pilot decided  not to land,  everyone sues.  And also, you know what?  You have an eight-hour flight  from the West Coast,  I'm thinking.  Yeah, just get her  off the plane.  Waste the hour,  hour and a half,  get her off the plane  and have a pleasant fight.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  I would go crazy.  Oh, thank you.  At least admit that.  Oh, no, no.  Because we've all  flown with you.  You would lose your mind. 
[02:12:30]  They're screaming.  They're turning around  for what?  But, no, no,  they were on their way.  They just made a land.  They didn't turn around.  Cincinnati to Francisco.  Get down to about  8,000 feet,  open the door,  one boot,  problem solved.  One kick to the...  Back to cruising altitude,  you're on your way,  you barely notice.  No, dude,  I would be furious  if I'm saying  if the option is that  or have your whole flight  with this screaming  whore on it,  you have to get her  off the plane.  And then you should  knock the teeth out.  Well, then you gag her.  All right.  Was she in first class?  I don't know.  Probably not.  Probably not behaving that way.  Then I wouldn't care. 
[02:13:00]  Ben G from Boston,  up your blank  with a rubber blank.  Missed the obvious there.  Yeah.  What was the famous line?  That was from  Welcome Back.  Oh, yeah.  Up your nose  with a rubber blank.  Oh, yeah.  That wasn't a Fonz thing.  Dummy.  Sorry.  Who emailed that in?  Ben G from Boston,  you stink.  Getting your shows  all mixed up.  Why don't you talk about  Keith Richards  and say,  up your nose  with your father?  Uh-huh.  This is fake.  Fake story.  I can't wait  to sing that song  in a few minutes.  All right, guys.  You have the lyrics 
[02:13:30]  already working on him?  Oh, I'm working on him  in my head.  I know.  I'm like Smokey Robinson  right now.  By the way,  a big thank you  to the cities  that are loving us.  Yeah.  Ratings are going to  come in all week  and we'll see  if a few other cities pop.  But New York,  thank you.  Chicago,  everyone listening  on WCKG,  stay tuned for Gary Meyer  who's back  on Chicago Radio.  And Philly,  we don't know.  No one knows  if we're doing well.  I swear to God,  no one knows.  It's not us making  an excuse or any of that crap.  No one knows  how to read the new ratings. 
[02:14:00]  They said it's like  reading the matrix.  It's just green symbols  that are falling  from computer monitors.  They really,  truly don't know  how to read the new system  that's in place in Philly.  Philly's like a test market,  the first city  to embrace  this new rating system.  And they've been doing it  for the last two months  and no one knows  what's going on.  No one can read them.  No one knows  if the show's doing well.  We just don't know.  Eventually,  they'll figure that out.  But I assume  that Philly's loving the show.  Everyone on WYSP,  thank you for listening.  And I'm back Monday.  Tomorrow's Bob...  What? 
[02:14:30]  What happened, Jimmy?  I'm going to Miami  to do some jokes  at the Coconut Grove Improv.  Not important.  Tomorrow's Bob Kelly.  Friday is Patrikio Neal.  Nice.  And then I'm back on Monday.  All right.  Have fun, Jimmy.  I hope so.  We'll see you guys  over at XM.  All right.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed  to talk about it, though.  I gotta go now.  Introducing the  Opie and Anthony Wow Line.  If you get wowed,  we want to hear about it. 
[02:15:00]  Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message  isn't too stupid,  we might just play it  on the air.  Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show!  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  We still walk every day and we still encourage the listeners to follow us on the walk and then you come up here and you become part of like this new live studio audience thing that's been happening lately. 
[02:19:00]  Uh, where is anybody?  They got to get their dumb paperwork.  Oh, just in case they're on the air.  By the way, in case you weren't listening yesterday.  That's his brother Joe, that's his version of Anthony's brother Joe, uh, we're loving it and we encourage other listeners to send in their version.  Yeah, we're always looking for new versions of that tune.  Yeah, we're always looking for new versions of that tune.  I like John S. in Hartford. His acoustic version was very, very good.  Yeah, really good.  Right now we're jamming the brother Joe version, so until another one, another one, another good one comes along. 
[02:19:30]  And then we'll give you some exposure as well.  Pretty fucking creative out there.  Absolutely.  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is the word, though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis, so no matter what you've heard, remember that penis is the proper word.  Penis is the word, even though most people call it vagina, and some children call it Virginia. 
[02:20:00]  Virginia?  What the fuck is that?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Just wondering why it takes so long to get people in here.  I don't know, because someone has to look important.  I like the smiles.  What do you say?  Miles of smiles.  Bulba.  Why don't we just sit here and wait for our studio audience?  I don't think Letterman performs without his audience. 
[02:20:30]  No.  How long is it going to take?  Jimmy's pissed.  Yell Jimmy from there.  Where are the people?  Where are the people?  Where are the people?  Just because what's going to happen is this.  There's a bunch of people that are standing outside in the shitty drizzly weather.  We're going to be halfway through a bit.  There's a microphone on out there.  And they're going to walk in and be seated in the middle.  It's like you should hand them paperwork while they're sitting here. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, why can't they?  They're fucking standing outside.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  They should fill out the paperwork while they're sitting.  They're on the hallway like a bunch of fucking creeps.  That was the greatest visual.  You just got up, opened the door and said, where are the people?  Where are the people?  The visual was the greatest.  Because when they come in.  Dude, I'm with you.  Trust me.  They don't talk.  They're not disruptive.  But when you have a microphone on outside.  I can see a little bit going on in the background.  Yeah.  They're going to walk in and get settled.  And I can see it.  I can hear it through my headphones.  It's going to drive me nuts.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Well, we got four of the people.  All right.  Where are the rest of the people?  That's twice as many as I thought.  Oh, okay.  Downstairs.  Downstairs.  They're all signing in with that fucking ghoul cunt that works at desk.  E-Rock what?  They're bringing them up now.  All right.  What was the fucking hold up?  What?  They have them polishing tiles down there?  Jimmy doesn't like that guy down there.  Just fucking bring the guys up.  There's a bunch of them.  Show ID.  Sign in.  Fucking hurry up.  That guy, by the way, is so pissed that I will not acknowledge him.  He's a jizz bucket.  He is out of his mind that I will not acknowledge him. 
[02:22:00]  I used to acknowledge the guy downstairs.  The guard at the desk.  The desk guy.  Because when the terrorists attack New York City again, of course they're going after this building.  Because, you know, because there's pianos in it somewhere.  Fuck.  Very important pianos.  So, I used to have a relationship with a guy.  You know, believe it or not, when I'm doing my everyday life, I'm actually nice to people as much as I can.  And so we had a little thing going.  And I would say hi to him every morning.  And then, I know I told a story, but right around Christmas time, I actually had Christmas gifts up here that I needed. 
[02:22:30]  And I was leaving town.  And I didn't have, um, I didn't have my, uh, oh, my building ID.  I lost it.  You need that building ID.  I lost my building ID.  Bye, gum.  This motherfucker downstairs who sees me every day, and we have this little small chat.  Oh, you were just pointing at him.  He goes, sorry, you can't go upstairs.  I thought he was joking, so I started walking. 
[02:23:00]  He goes, no, I'm serious, you can't go upstairs.  I'm like, you see me every fucking day.  Hey, I got Christmas presents upstairs.  Sorry, I can't let you buy.  Did you say it like that?  You see me every fucking day?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It got really, it got really ugly.  You got off on a wrong point.  No, well, it developed to this point.  You should have agreed.  I was nice.  I was nice at first.  Sure.  But then it developed to that point.  And to make a long story short, never came up here.  And I had to actually tell two people, your Christmas gift is stuck in my office. 
[02:23:30]  And they're looking at me like, what a scumbag.  You didn't buy me anything?  I'm like, no, I did.  It's in the fucking office.  I swear to you.  The guy would not let me upstairs.  I'm like, you bastard.  So I haven't acknowledged him since.  And now he's just out of his mind.  He can't understand why I won't look at him or say a word to him.  It's three months.  And Jimmy was the one that started this because I was like, ah, Jimmy, you're crazy.  He's all right.  I pioneered this, what I call the hating shitbag campaign. 
[02:24:00]  And I refused to talk to him because he's a cunt.  And you want to treat me like a robot, then I will look at you like the dog shit piece  of machinery you are and not speak to you like a person.  I don't say hello to the door and I don't say hi to the elevator.  So why would I say hi to you, robot boy?  You want to play official boss with me?  Fuck you.  You're a piece of equipment.  The other guy I say hi to, I see.  And then there's another guy because then I had people visiting.  I'm like, hey, I want to show people where I work.  So I took a chance and I walked.  I still didn't have my building ID and I walked by. 
[02:24:30]  I'm like, oh, it's a different guy.  All right, let's give it a try.  So we came in.  And not only did the guy let me up without the building ID.  I didn't have a key or anything.  He freaking gets some kind of master key and lets me in.  Like any human being would do.  And they would figure it out on their feed.  Like, oh, obviously, you know, there's a problem that I can help them with.  Yeah.  He's by the book.  I like him.  I like the guy down there at the desk.  He's by the book.  He's a douche.  The book called Jerkoff.  He's by it. 
[02:25:00]  He's a douche.  Studio audience.  Let's hear it.  Oh, there they are.  There they are.  Live studio audience.  Are we going to have to do a studio audience every day now?  No.  I don't know if they can pull this off every day.  This is what I was shouting for.  This collection of white people.  You might as well open that door again and say, where are the people?  Are there more coming up?  Oh, just you guys.  What is the coveted seat?  The couch?  Yeah.  Girls have come on that couch, by the way, and squirted. 
[02:25:30]  And one girl had her period.  So enjoy the seat.  Wait, were you here last time with a sister?  Yes.  You were?  Okay.  And this is your girlfriend now?  My fiance.  Oh, congratulations.  Hey.  Wow, she's a huge step up from your sister.  Oh, my God.  You shouldn't fuck your sister, dude.  Girl's much better.  It was pretty crazy what you admitted to us on the air that day when your fiance was not here.  Fiance's smoking.  I bet he's got a red-headed boy.  I bet he has a big fucking, a big old hog with freckles on it and fucking little red pubes around it.  I mean, I'm just speculating.  No disrespect. 
[02:26:00]  Does he got a big hog, ma'am?  Yeah.  How big?  Show us with the fingers.  Yeah, right.  Dude, that, or is that from, from the asshole?  Where are you measuring from?  Yeah, you don't measure it from the back of the spine.  From the top of my head.  Yeah, exactly.  Back of that neck.  Do that again.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's, let's, let's move, uh, the goalposts in a little bit.  He's eight and a quarter.  He's eight and a quarter.  You got eight and a quarter?  Good boy.  I bet Thans hung like a horse. 
[02:26:30]  Call his sister.  Confirm that.  Fancy that got 12.  Fancy that got, Fancy that got nine by five or, or two by two.  There's no fucking around with fucking, uh, Nathaniel.  Have we ever, um, or have you over the years know what this fucking monster is packing over  here?  Oh yeah, he's told.  So do Kenny.  I've never asked Kenny.  No, he's told us.  What?  I'm going to guess like six.  No, he's, he's got nothing.  Because Kenny's an animal.  He's a big monster.  Well, why do you think he tastes karate?  But not where it counts. 
[02:27:00]  No?  No.  Yeah, he's an animal there.  Just a lemming.  What do you got?  Smaller one.  What is, no, I would say less.  You're lying.  What am I holding up, Jimmy?  Um, I'd say six.  No, that's maybe five.  That's five.  Maybe four.  Anthony laughs at this.  I'm looking like, what the.  Anthony laughs at that even if it's girth.  All right, tell me when.  And be honest, Kenny.  Tell me when to stop.  I'm moving the goalposts in.  Okay.  I hope he's moving his fingers closer.  Closer.  Be honest. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  Oh my God.  You have like.  Hey girls, feel free to laugh at Kenny.  What is that called?  When you got the dick the size of an infant?  Baby dick.  Baby dick, right.  Okay.  This is what Kenny's sporting right there.  Kenny, you got five?  Five.  That's more like four.  I haven't measured since I was 16.  Well, sometimes we misjudge our dicks because you're looking at it from a weird angle.  Do you measure from the top or the bottom?  I start from the base.  I'm fair.  But I always suck my gut in a little.  And I push in that skin because I can technically get that into her box. 
[02:28:00]  Anything I can push into the pussy, I fucking measure.  It's considered dick.  Like, yeah, there's like a little skin there, but if I fuck hard enough, I'll just fucking  force it all in there just to keep the stats.  He's like fucking tucking in sheets.  Oh, are you doing?  My thigh skin is all in.  While we have Kenny here, dump report with Club Soda Kenny.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let's do that today.  And also getting news that Iran has pardoned the British sailors there.  Yes.  Of course, the president of Iran got up there like a big fucking Mr. Making Everybody Free 
[02:28:30]  Guy had to get up there and have his personal little speech.  Well, I mean, I'm almost going to say with Iran this time, they saved face.  Everybody had to save face and everybody did.  It was like when the U.S. spy plane or whatever had a problem and landed and they actually crashed  into a Chinese military jet of a Chinese airspace and China captured them.  They kept the spy plane, but they let the pilot go, but they had to posture a little bit.  That's what they do.  That's what, especially a country like a communist country like China or fucking Iran.  Iran is supposed to not have taken them. 
[02:29:00]  Supposed to chase them out of their waters and leave them alone.  We're not in any conflict with Iran.  Yeah, but we're not friends either.  Oh, I don't know.  I get so nerfed.  I don't like it.  I think some bombing.  I see some bombing.  No, that's diplomacy.  And I think it's good that Pelosi is going over there.  I really do.  Ugh.  I do.  I think you've got to have relationships with these people.  I'm sick and tired of being isolated.  Did you see her put the rag around her head, though?  Yeah.  Ideal.  It's all right.  You're giving up. 
[02:29:30]  No, I'm not.  You're giving up.  Nah, common sense.  9-12-2001.  Were you thinking like this, my friend?  No.  No, I wasn't either.  Neither was the whole country.  But I'm not bailing out either.  I just think that you have to use common sense.  And you can't not have relationships with Syria or Iran when they're in the Middle East.  It's like, you might as well.  What the fuck?  I think just because we're in a douchebag situation in Iraq doesn't mean we have to let everyone  else off the fucking hook.  Agreed.  But it's not just Iraq.  It's everybody fucking hates us. 
[02:30:00]  I think that makes it hard for us.  Immediately, they should have blockaded Iran.  I think immediately the British Navy should have gone out there with their wooden ships  and cannons like South Park.  Well, they didn't need to, though.  They wound up just holding out a little bit.  You talk, we talk.  Everybody saves face and they're fine.  They saves face.  The British soldiers now fucking look like assholes.  They look like assholes now, man.  No, they don't.  I don't think they look bad.  They look bad.  They were fucking on television being paraded around like fucking assholes. 
[02:30:30]  They did that to our guys in the original Gulf War.  Zahn, I think his name was or whatever.  That guy with the Z, the fucking pilot that was shot down.  Yeah, well, then how come nothing fucking comes of it but you put a leash around some  savage's fucking neck in a jail and the world goes bullshit?  What the fuck is that about?  You know, we take more shit.  I'm tired of these fucking monkey countries.  We take so much shit for treating these people badly.  And the second they fucking start parading soldiers around and making them make statements, 
[02:31:00]  let's use diplomacy.  Everything's fine.  And now it'll look like St. fucking Ted Redd is letting these guys go.  Fuck him.  Fuck his stupid sand country.  Don't forget, he's got to say, and again, in fairness, he's got to save face in front  of people too.  Save face.  It's too late.  He can't be seen as a puppet of the West.  They're not really rational people.  He knows those people aren't very rational.  I mean, he's got to save face in front of his own people.  And the difference between that, I think, and the hostage, like the parading, I do think 
[02:31:30]  the whole world overreacted.  I do think the whole world overreacted.  Absolutely, because any fucking thing we do is shit in the world.  Anything we do is shit.  And these fucking assholes can get away with whatever they want.  And there's no outrage.  There's no...  Look at them.  They're putting them on camera.  And Britain even said, don't put our fucking soldiers on camera confessing.  It's bullshit.  They don't mean it.  They're being forced into saying this stuff.  And there's no outrage for it. 
[02:32:00]  They'll get them back.  These guys are going to be fucking drummed out of the service, if I might say that.  I don't think so.  Absolutely.  Why?  Because they fucking went...  You're not supposed to do this.  You're a soldier.  You're supposed to name rank and serial number, my friend.  Yeah, but they would...  I don't know, man.  When you look at the...  Here's the problem with the whole Lindy England situation and the whole fucking prisoner abuse  in Iraq is that we have to stop shooting off our mouths and telling everybody else how  to live and telling everybody else how to be and then...  Who's telling us how to live?  When we tell people how to live, we sure as shit don't fly a couple of planes into their 
[02:32:30]  buildings because that's what they were doing, telling us how to fucking live.  They don't like our way of fucking life.  No, no.  I mean, but I mean, we're like the democratic country.  We're supposed to be different than that and we're supposed to have different standards  and we preach about shit like that and then when you get caught doing embarrassing  shit like that with prisoners in a country you're supposed to...  It just looks bad.  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's just embarrassing and it looks bad.  I don't know.  It's not like they're just knocking some guy who's a terrorist around like Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed to get fucking information.  These are people that were just humiliating because they were bored and I mean, again, 
[02:33:00]  it's not a beheading.  No big deal as far as I'm concerned.  Yeah, it's not.  The whole world though who was against the invasion to begin with is not going to look  at that favorably.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like most of the world was like, look, just fucking stay out of there.  We should have stayed out of there.  Fuck Saddam.  He should have just been able to wipe his own people out if he wanted to.  I agree with that.  I agree with that 100%.  But just like I said, because we're in a shitty situation in Iraq and the world fucking  can't stand us doesn't mean we ought to let some of these other fucking piss countries  off the hook.  They ought to have been given a little more.  And the United Nations, useless, given their stupid statements about these British troops 
[02:33:30]  that were held.  Take 10 fucking years for the UN to work anything out.  Yeah, they're awful.  These guys would be old men.  Sorry, audience.  You picked the wrong data.  Um, to see.  Oh, no, no, no.  We have some kid toucher jokes.  Don't you worry.  Yeah, don't worry.  They want the dick jokes.  I want the Fonzie song.  Uh, let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Chris.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Where the hell are you from?  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:00]  Listen to Anthony.  He's wise beyond his years.  Where am I from?  What do you mean, sir?  And go slow.  Don't barrel through.  We'll go back and forth.  Go.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Listen.  Just seeing Pelosi with that headscarf on, what does that say to the world?  Nothing.  Come on.  Dude.  It just says that she's a fucking cunt that will bow out to these fucks.  You should never agree, too.  I mean, obviously, you're a well-spoken man.  You make a good point.  But the problem I'm saying is we've tried the other way.  And I'm not some bleeding-heart liberal. 
[02:34:30]  But the guys from Iran and Syria, they both went on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer.  In their own way, these are radical fucking guys.  They're the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world.  And they are, in some weird part, doing public relations shit, which certainly goes against the philosophies of guys like Al-Zarqawi and bin Laden.  And they're making some kind of a weird little move into the middle of the road.  So you have to kind of meet with them just because if you don't, you're going to have these problems.  And I'm sick of having these problems.  They're all part of a machine, though. 
[02:35:00]  They're part of a whole mechanism where you've got the real fucking fanatics that are chopping heads off.  And you have these guys that are meeting with our diplomats and politicians.  And they're part of the same machine.  They're working a lot of different angles for the same purpose.  They hate us.  They hate our way of life.  They're Muslim extremists.  They hate the Jews.  They want Israel wiped out.  They all have the same ideology. 
[02:35:30]  They're just using different ways to get their goals.  But I tell you one thing.  If you have some kind of dialogue with these people, they can go in and get things done that you can't.  Dialogue's great.  I mean, look at Musharraf in Pakistan.  He has the most radical people, and because he is on our side, and his people hate him for it,  but because he's on our side, we get shit done with Pakistan.  I mean, if you have Assad and the Iranian president in some kind of relationship with you,  they don't give a fuck about these small packs of beheading people.  They will give them up in a second if it's going to help make their lives easier, too. 
[02:36:00]  They don't want to fucking have problems with us constantly.  It's silly.  It doesn't work for them either.  But they have to do it a certain way just like we do.  We can't just – Pelosi, let her go over there.  It's about time.  But she puts the fucking towel on her head.  She just – it seems like a cave.  Like, again, again, September 12th, 2001.  Agreed.  Do you think one fucking politician is going to put a rag on their fucking head?  They would be crucified in this country.  It's not – you add a few years to September 11th, and people just fucking lose it. 
[02:36:30]  They forget, they blame our own government, they blame everybody.  I watched fucking videos last night of Building 7 falling down and hearing some asshole college cunt talk about how it was exploded.  Enough.  Shut up.  I don't want to hear your fucking theories anymore.  But those are separate – those are like separate things.  Those are not like – you're right.  But those radical douchebags were doing that stuff right after September 11th because they need attention and they need mommy and daddy to see that they're doing – they're phonies. 
[02:37:00]  They're not real.  I mean, with this – I think Bush fucked up so bad that we can't even dish out discipline to those who need it.  And as far as her wearing a headscarf, all right, it's cool.  But these guys are radicals and they're wearing members-only jackets.  I mean, it's not – you know, it's like we've got to fucking – I mean –  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Yes.  Penis.  Let's say hi to –  Slides right in a cunt.  Penis. 
[02:37:30]  Kick her out if she has a bunt.  Let's say hi to John on Long Island.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Love the show.  Hey.  Yeah.  I agree with Secretary Norton over there and I have to disagree with Anthony because I know you're a millionaire and you can afford the price of gas.  But if we had attacked Iran, forget about it.  $10 a gallon.  Oh, don't worry about the gas.  20% of the oil that we get out of the world comes out of that strait of Amuse over there.  And it's already gone up because it escalated – the hostage situation escalated the price to go up from like – in the 50s, it's like $65 a gallon. 
[02:38:00]  And then the second they say something about the fact that they might get released, it drops back down again.  That's great.  No one is saying the U.S. should roll over and get our fucking teeth kicked in.  I'm not saying the war would I ran.  Stop it.  I just – I'm like, I'm tired of these problems.  I'm tired of fucking hearing about soldiers being killed every day over dog shit.  See, we're worn down.  We've been worn fucking down because I'm – you're right.  I'm tired of it too. 
[02:38:30]  I'm tired of fucking sitting here and watching the news every day and you look for a solution.  And then if a solution presents itself that's like, eh, all right, we got to make friends with this guy or that guy, then you kind of go, all right, if it's going to end this.  But it's not.  You think we could talk to these other – these fucking heads of countries all we want.  We could be on the best of terms.  They come over to fucking dinner and you have dinner with them.  There's still going to be motherfuckers that fly planes into buildings if they get an opportunity.  There will be radical elements, yeah, but these guys, I'm telling you, man, they have an interest in this too. 
[02:39:00]  They're politicians in their own country.  They have an interest in success and in not being at war either.  And I'm telling you, if they can make life easier with the U.S. and still look good at home, that little fucking radical faction that is actually going to kill themselves, they will fucking throw them to the wolves in a second.  I'd like to see that.  Just like any other group would throw their people to the wolves.  I would like to see that.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  I think we might have to agree to disagree, Jimmy.  Hey, I haven't talked in 20 minutes and that was going to be my line.  Oh, shit. 
[02:39:30]  That was my worth today.  What's up, Max?  That's true.  You had a couple of doozies in Free FM.  Boy, did I.  Love you, boys.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Sorry, man.  We just chit-chat sometimes.  I've become more moderate in my old age.  I respect your right to your opinion, but I got to go with Ann on this one.  Oh, no.  I mean, come on.  What about those fucking animals dragging our guys through the streets in Mogadishu?  Dude, Max, I don't even disagree with you, but that's Mogadishu. 
[02:40:00]  We shouldn't have been there to begin with.  We shouldn't have been in any of these places.  Fuck them.  I'm not saying let's go over and be, let's let them kill each other.  I don't give a fuck.  Fuck Mogadishu.  Either drop a big bomb or stay out.  Stop interfering with everybody's business.  It's not our problem.  Oh, boy.  I totally agree with you.  They're leaving.  They're putting their coats on as we speak, and they're heading toward the door.  You see how those people over there respect women?  Who cares? 
[02:40:30]  I don't respect women.  I'm sick and tired of hearing about women in Middle Eastern countries.  Big deal.  They couldn't vote here until the 20s.  Big fucking deal.  We didn't let blacks vote until the 60s.  All of a sudden, we're this fucking bastion of free speech.  England, I think, as annoying as they are, has a little bit better grasp on free speech than we do.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, you get to see the porn.  Yeah, I mean, they're a little bit sexually more liberated than we are.  I'll tell you something.  I'll tell you something.  Well, that's true, because I've seen some awful fucking protesters over there in England  that are allowed to really, really bash England, Muslims, holding up signs saying the Britons 
[02:41:00]  should be put to death, and this was in England, and whatever.  There should be consequences to that.  A good spanking, perhaps?  Yes, yes, on their hairy bottoms.  Harry in D.C., please remind callers that love the show is supposed to sound forced.  Yes, that's the bid.  They're already forgetting the bid for some reason.  Rich in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, Rich.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what's up?  How can you say that George Bush is a big fuck-up, and what he's done is fucked up?  We went into Iraq to get rid of someone.  We did.  Now we're having trouble getting out.  Well, that's why he fucked up.  He answered your own question.  Yeah.  That's why Bush Sr. didn't go in, dude, because you can't pull out.  There's no exit plan.  Who cares what Saddam is doing?  That's not our problem.  Guys, fuck the Kurds.  I'm tired of hearing about the Kurds.  I used to say Kurds.  The Kurds suck.  No one gave a shit about the Kurds. 
[02:42:00]  Is this Anthony or is this Jimmy?  This is Jimmy.  I believe I said Anthony.  Oh, well.  I don't know.  Let me address you.  I apologize, sir.  I didn't mean to interfere with your stupid question.  You answered as you were asking.  You honestly don't think that – did you think when we went into Iraq that four years later, longer than the U.S. involvement in World War II, we would still be there with really not a peep of light at the end of the tunnel?  Did you think that, Rich?  Honestly, I don't have a – I didn't think that at all. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I didn't either.  I didn't think that at all.  Bottom line is, though, name one other president that said I'd put up with two major disasters in his presidency.  Bill Clinton, the 93 Trade Center bombing and a cigar in the cunt.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good joke.  That's real funny.  Yes, I know, sir.  That's why I said it.  I'm just saying.  I'm glad you appreciate that.  You can give a correct answer without trying to be funny, though.  What's that, sir?  Can you give a correct answer without trying to be funny? 
[02:43:00]  That's why I question it.  If you really think you're going to –  This shows term from funny –  This is not meet the press, you fucking cunt.  If I want to make a joke, I'll make a joke, you crushing bore.  You called up and said, why don't you like George Bush just because he went in and couldn't get out?  You answered your own question, stupid.  You answered your own question.  I'm stupid now because I ask a question that you can't answer.  You answered your own question.  And what was the second major disaster for Bush?  How about another president with a major disaster? 
[02:43:30]  I don't know, Kennedy.  How about this?  Vietnam and his head coming off.  I would say those are major disasters.  Katrina was no big deal for the people that don't live down there.  How about Nixon, Vietnam, and Watergate?  It wasn't a big deal for the presidency.  He didn't take a lot of heat for that.  What's that?  Maybe he did.  We're over that one, though.  Maybe he did.  He did.  Dude, you can't say you don't think –  You guys can sit here and bash Bush all you want.  Look, it's not a Bush bashing.  This is bashing a president that really didn't go about this really the best way he could have. 
[02:44:00]  And I'm putting it very mildly.  What's that?  Name one president has had a great eight or four years.  Harry S. Truman.  Bomb him into the Stone Age.  Yeah, look what I got us.  Out of World War II?  Do you think Bush is doing a good job?  I don't think he's doing a bad job.  That's not answering the question.  He's doing a job that he's surrounded himself with smart people.  Yeah, really smart people. 
[02:44:30]  Colin Powell fucking has his dick hanging out in the United Nations saying that there was proof of uranium sales.  Yeah, you're right.  They're really smart people.  How do you explain that?  If we went into Iraq without permission, do you think we're going to go into Iran without permission?  Dude, how do you explain that?  If he surrounds himself with smart people, how do you explain Colin Powell, the most overrated guy in the government ever,  swinging his dick around in the United Nations saying we have absolute proof when we didn't?  How do you explain that if he has smart people around him?  Bottom line is, Colin Powell knew something, and they got rid of something. 
[02:45:00]  That was a good answer.  Colin Powell knew something, but I won't make any jokes because you're trying to be serious.  I say, all right, explain that.  And you go, he knew something, they got rid of something.  You are an ass.  They got rid of what they were hiding.  You can't sit here and tell me that they weren't fucking working with weapons.  Oh, God, here it is, the speculation on whether there were weapons.  You get more speculation that'll never fucking be resolved.  You're a horrible bore, sir.  Why don't you guys sit here and say, well, the Iran guy's being real political.  That motherfucker's the biggest terrorist in the world. 
[02:45:30]  Of course he is.  That's what I said.  Yeah, Anthony said that.  Those screaming monkeys over there are terrorists.  That fucking president of Iran is one of the guys that held our guys hostages back in the 80s.  And he's not the biggest terrorist in the world, sir.  He's not a cleric, which is a big thing.  I'm telling you, an elected president, this guy is a wolf in sheep's clothing, Jimmy,  if I might use an outdated fucking...  He's not as bad as a cleric.  He wears a Western attire to make us fucking look at him like, well, he's a regular guy.  He's not wearing a rag on his head. 
[02:46:00]  He doesn't shave, unless he does every day and it just grows back in 15 minutes.  Yeah, he shaves a few times a day.  The guy's got the constant fucking Don Johnson look.  But he wouldn't have released these British troops if he was going to do anything really crazy.  He wouldn't have.  It's to make himself look better.  And it worked.  Yeah, it worked.  Now people are thinking this guy's fan-fucking-tastic.  He's a rock star.  He could have done anything he wanted to, but none of the world would have approved any country  to go in there and do something about it.  I hear Pelosi had a clit removed while she was over there with a spade shovel. 
[02:46:30]  Well, she doesn't need it anymore.  Yeah, she accidentally hit it with that fucking weak gavel swimmer.  Someone's saying she's got huge boobs, though.  Is that true?  Someone's noticing that she's got the big boobies.  We'll agree to Frankus.  In the words of Anthony Cumia, holy shit.  I know.  Holy shit.  How did we get so dull?  Holy shit.  We're having fun listening to the Fonz, and all of a sudden we see a few uncut cots on TV.  We all lose our minds.  Jimmy, savage cock.  We go wild.  You know what you have to do to make everyone happy?  What? 
[02:47:00]  La, la, la, la, la.  Like when Jimmy sings.  Jimmy knows.  Oh, okay.  Jimmy knows.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's a guarantee every time.  Yeah.  Jimmy's ass was being held hostage.  He just released it.  I just showed it.  Give everybody a little something.  Show that it's safe.  We got a little jingle for the dump report.  We haven't done it in a while.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:47:30]  All right, Club Soda County.  Wow, all those?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Schlemiel.  Oh, Kenny can count to ten.  Wow.  None of us cocky, Kent.  Stops at four.  7.42 a.m.  We start off.  I was pleasuring her orally.  Yeah.  A caller talking about bondage sex.  Knew that one was coming. 
[02:48:00]  Uh-huh.  7.52 a.m.  Felt something dripping.  It was number two.  Yeah.  Knew that was coming, too.  We can't handle that as a society.  Number two.  You can't hear that on the radio.  You can't hear about dripping number two on the radio.  Even though five, six-year-olds talk about duty.  I got to go number two.  All that shit.  Actually, parents say that.  Do you got to go number one or number two?  Supposedly, we're protecting the children, but this is the only thing they talk about when  they're that age.  Yeah.  Right.  And then Al's. 
[02:48:30]  And we have nothing to do with that.  Al's editorialized explanation is,  Caller talking about having sex with his girl on top, and then things were interrupted.  All right.  Thank you, Al.  7.53 a.m.  We were switching different orifices.  Yeah.  Okay, we knew that one.  Caller during discussion about having sex with her boyfriend.  7.54 a.m.  I was blanking my boyfriend, and he took a blank on me.  It's the took a blank, right?  Opie reading an instant feedback. 
[02:49:00]  After the previous caller's story, this didn't make the air.  That shouldn't have made the air, but I agree.  7.55 a.m.  I was in the crunching position, and I farted, and something more happened.  A lot more.  I don't know why that.  That should be all to go through.  That's a little fucking panicky by Al.  Yeah.  Caller saying she was on top and having sex with her boyfriend.  Explosive diarrhea all over the dude.  Yeah.  7.58 a.m.  Yeah, it was stuck in her. 
[02:49:30]  Caller talking about having sex with a woman and using oranges during sex, and she had  to go to the emergency room.  Spelling it.  And the boyfriend squirted her with fucking insecticide.  You're spelling it.  8.16 a.m.  Opie said to call her cursed.  And here's Al.  It was mumbled, so I didn't know what it was, so he dumped it just to be safe.  Yeah, I heard a shit or a fuck or something. 
[02:50:00]  He was in the middle of me yapping.  8.23 a.m.  Little Jimmy.  Fuck.  Yep.  That was cute, because he thought, he got all embarrassed, he went, fuck, and then put  his hand over his mouth, like, oh.  I like fucking Sandy Duncan in Roots.  I should have had a white glove on.  Just covered my mouth daintily.  30-year anniversary, Roots.  Yes.  It's on Comedy Central.  Go ahead, Kenny.  8.30 a.m.  Little Jimmy singing. 
[02:50:30]  If you put a penis in it, you come out with a turd.  Yeah, I kind of knew that was happening.  Like a little Lincoln hat, so much gray area in that one.  And number 10, 8.44 a.m., it's too fucking hilarious from a caller.  The callers were potty mouths.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get into the song over here.  Oh, yeah.  It's the Henry Winkler song.  And then we got Vanilla Ice rapping about taxes.  Tax season's here.  What?  Ew.  Yeah.  No, stop. 
[02:51:00]  No, I'm serious.  Oh, no.  After the break, you get to hear Vanilla Ice rap about taxes.  Thank God.  Can you write this just for this?  Only the best for our listeners.  Well, the song...  This is our A stuff, by the way, guys, because we knew we had a studio audience.  I want to know what he's going to...  Where is he going to go with the song?  Because I know one of the lines is, my tax bill is getting bigger.  So I'm interested to see...  Yeah, what he comes up with next.  Hung out the window by what?  All right.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It's not nude.  It's just girls flashing guys that have W-O-W on their vehicle somewhere. 
[02:51:30]  That's the WOW campaign.  Wow.  For details on how to get your very own WOW steer, go to opieandhempony.com.  Look at that WOW.  It's still happening.  Oh, it's still...  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I got it one piece at a time, and it didn't cost me a dime.  You'll nurse me when I come through your town.  I don't know this one, Jimmy.  Yeah, this is...  This one's like a big kickball.  Still on the Cadillac.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Wow, I don't know this one.  Johnny Cash, right?  See, he works at a car factory.  Give me that!  And he takes pieces of cars out, and it took him a real long time to do it,  but he bolted them all together, and he finally had a full car,  but it was, you know, all big conglomerated mulatto mongrel.  Oh, Cadillac.  They got to get, by the way.  Let the song play.  They shouldn't just keep playing the same guitar lick.  Let the next thing play.  Somebody look up my Mets tickets for opening day and tell me where I'm sitting. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, boy.  If they're not good, I'm ripping them up right now.  Atta boy.  Let's go to Philly.  Say hi to Ray.  Ray, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, Bo?  You know, about, like, the dumps, man, and the ratings,  he's like, I want to help you guys out with ratings any way I can,  but, like, when Al's dumping out all the words, the number two,  like, it's really hard to listen on Free FM, and, you know, I mean, like,  what do you guys, like, want me to do?  Like I said, man, like, I want to listen and help out the Free FM side and everything, 
[02:53:00]  but it's like...  You're not a fan, because you started to call any way I could.  You know, sometimes you've got to help us out and do what you've got to do.  No, no, no, here's what you do.  You just lie.  Yeah, dude, what the fuck?  Support the local stations, sir.  Don't you understand what support the local radio stations actually means?  Support the stations.  Do we have to spell it out for you?  That's all we're saying.  Allie, if we do spell it out for you, we'll get in trouble.  All we say is support, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Al does not dump that bad. 
[02:53:30]  For a while, they had a talk, and he actually is very good compared to...  You ought to see what JV and Elvis' guy dumps.  I went over a dump thing that Minnelli prepared for us,  and that JV and Elvis' dump guy should have his fucking nose bitten off.  It's awful.  What the...  Picture your grandmother naked.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Picture your grandmother naked, pledging herself over the dump button.  See, you went...  Ah, goddamn, punch it out.  You had no faith in that.  Too late.  You can't punch out. 
[02:54:00]  Did Elo buy me tickets for the fucking parking lot?  Oh, no, what happened?  Let's see.  Turn around.  Let me see.  Where is it?  Where is it?  Are you serious?  Could you spin that around?  Where is it?  You see this?  Oh, my God.  Those are the worst seats.  It's not even left field.  It's way up in the right field bleachers.  Oh, that's hilarious.  It's the second to last section.  Dude, that is hysterical.  You know what you could do there, though, in that seat?  What the...  This is my view. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, you know what you do, though?  What?  Check every fucking plane from LaGuardia.  Make sure the baggage things are closed and tightened.  You can reach up and spin the handle and check on the tightness.  Elo, thank you for the Met tickets.  Oh, no.  You're actually closer to home plate than Yankee Stadium.  Oh, no.  Oh, look, look, look.  Oh, look, look.  Look at through the window.  Look at the disappointed look on Danny's wearing a meth hat.  You don't want to sit in fucking right field...  Danny doesn't care.  Yes, he does. 
[02:55:00]  You're closer to your car than your park.  Just being in the park.  It's a home opener.  Just being in the park.  Huh?  You can still use that if you want to really...  Oh, no.  Oh, why?  Danny wants to go.  Fuck.  Danny, you want to go, right?  Yeah, well, he can dig out the garbage and then...  I take him back up.  Garbage picker.  Garbage picker.  Garbage picker.  What the fuck, Elo?  What are you looking for, garbage picker? 
[02:55:30]  Food?  Garbage picker?  By the way, y'all...  Look, go pick the garbage.  Garbage picker.  By the way, you saved me a trip heading out there, so...  You dropped one of the...  You dropped something, stupid.  You dropped something.  And by the way, you know, he also said that the tickets for you were behind home plate.  Yep.  You know they were way down the third base line, right?  They weren't even close to home plate.  Why can't we get good tickets?  They were nice tickets.  Ah.  They aren't nice tickets.  We got Major League Baseball on XM. 
[02:56:00]  Get us some fucking tickets.  Were they bad tickets, Stan?  No.  They were...  Where's the mic?  Oh, sweetie, what happened?  How bad were they, really?  Danny, stop looking at your tickets.  Stop taping together your tickets.  Turn the mic on.  Garbage picker.  They were coming in, yes?  No?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  They were, like, six rows back, about ten feet back from third base.  Yeah.  He said they were behind home plate.  Behind home plate would not be the proper description.  Well, technically...  Thank you. 
[02:56:30]  He said they were behind home plate.  If you count, like, the foul lines and everything behind it being behind home plate...  Yeah, we weren't in play.  Yeah, you weren't in play.  Dude, I have a better view from a seat on Continental than these fucking tickets he gave me.  They do stink.  That's a flying over Shea Stadium plane joke, by the way.  Yeah.  Well, Continental occasionally.  I think they probably just...  No, they just don't.  They just didn't get it.  I'm going to find the humor in it.  I'm going to be honest with you.  I don't think Continental flies out of LaGuardia.  Oh, yes, they do. 
[02:57:00]  I've flown through Cleveland.  Jet Blue does.  Do they?  Oh, no.  Jet Blue flies out of Kennedy.  We've taken that flight.  Out of LaGuardia?  Sweetie.  Sorry.  When all of these tickets weren't there, that was LaGuardia Airport going to Cleveland.  So you guys flew and I didn't.  That's all right.  Thanks for reminding me.  No, but you got a better flight.  You got a direct.  18-hour flight to Vegas.  Yeah.  You are none too happy about that one.  I don't know.  Usually when you assume you're getting on a plane, you get on the plane.  How about Henry Winkler?  We're just kind of going in circles.  Hey, yeah.  All right.  But listen, dude.  Just support the local station. 
[02:57:30]  That's all.  That's all we ask.  We're treading on dangerous ground.  I understand.  Just.  No, the Henry Winkler is important, but there was something else that was really good.  Oh, yeah.  I don't see anything more important than Henry Winkler right now.  Maybe my new hero, Georgia man sentenced to life in prison for raping daughter in cemetery.  What a ghoul.  I can't believe that got a laugh.  Of course it did.  I didn't know Bob Edwards was from Georgia. 
[02:58:00]  Yes, they read from Bob.  I'm here.  Man got life raping his own daughter in a cemetery.  It was just days after her 16th birthday, and he took her to a graveyard and told her to lie down.  He said, you know, you're old enough to date boys now.  He told her, I'm about to break you in.  Oh, break you in.  Sometimes you gotta.  Otherwise, how did they learn?  You ghoul.  I guess they didn't know what to get her.  Yeah.  What do I get? 
[02:58:30]  How about I'll give her a fucking.  I'll give her a trust shatterer.  You know it's sounding more like, you know you're old enough to be with boys.  I'm going to have to break in.  We got to play the song now.  Well, he took out a condom and raped her.  Oh, and he used a condom.  And he later brought her back to the cemetery and sodomized her.  Oh, and this is not funny. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Sorry.  During the sentence during Friday, the daughter sobbed as she spoke to her father for the first  time in a year.  I got so depressed that I wanted to kill myself.  How could someone I trust to protect me and I knew all my life do something as evil and  dirty as this? 
[02:59:30]  Boring.  Can we play the, uh, do you have any of the, uh, dramatic music?  Uh, it's terrible.  Oh, the.  Oh.  Stingers?  No, just because with the joke.  She was very badly raped, you see?  Oh, my God.  See, why do we miss the obvious lines?  Barry from Pittsburgh, uh, raping a graveyard for her 16th birthday. 
[03:00:00]  You won't see that on MTV's Sweet Sixteen.  Sweet Sixteen.  Um, uh, yes, uh, uh, Jimmy?  Um, the judge said you did this to your daughter twice.  Once in the graveyard and then again in the courtroom.  Once in the graveyard and again in the dumper.  Brought her back to sodomize her.  You gotta love the fact this guy won't even spring for a hotel. 
[03:00:30]  What a chiseler.  Not only does he like incest, but he's a fucking pinch penny.  He's cheapo.  You would think you would, uh, teach, you know, uh, never mind.  Forget it.  What?  No.  Honey.  That's a, that's a bell right there.  All right, here we go.  Here's the song.  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is the word, though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis, so no matter what you've heard, remember that penis is the proper word. 
[03:01:00]  Vulva.  Vulva.  Is what girls have down below.  Even though most people call it vagina, and some children call it Virginia.  Vulva.  When she's naked, it will show.  All girls have a vulva, so no matter what you've heard, remember that vulva is the proper word.  Our anus.  Anus.  Is a useful thing indeed.  The anus gives relief in time of need.  We all have an anus, so no matter what you've heard, remember that anus is the proper word. 
[03:01:30]  So don't be appalled, cause that's what they're called, and each of them's the proper word.  Bum, bum.  For private parts.  A radio discomfort.  What?  I don't know, I don't understand that.  What did the little kids say?  I think he just accused the guy with the guitar of hurting his anus.  Hey, where's my, uh, I was only joking, uh, clip?  It's over at Free FM. 
[03:02:00]  They don't have it over here?  No, I think Dan refused.  Oh, all right.  Why are we not doing anything with that song?  We're just kind of listening to it.  I know.  I think it's fucking top 40.  Well, I liked it.  Anus.  Tom from Connecticut.  Just anus.  Opie, just because you're not funny doesn't mean you have to always be outrageous and rip up  tickets.  You could have given it to someone.  Good one.  You dick fuck shit bag.  All one word.  Mr. M from Flushing. 
[03:02:30]  The seats.  Hold on, excuse me.  Either laugh or don't.  I don't mind if you don't, but don't give me that, uh, titter.  Dude, how bad are those seats?  Seriously.  They're awful.  Mr. M deserves something.  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  I love the people that think they're, you know, too cool for, where they would, like,  go to the game because someone gave them to them.  Oh, I got them.  I don't want to be rude.  You know what?  Be rude.  The seats stink.  Danny's going to be sitting into some stinky seats. 
[03:03:00]  And I did give them to Danny, sort of.  If he went in the garbage, he got them, and he's going to go to the game one day.  He picked them out of the garbage.  It wasn't that degrading.  He got three tickets.  But, you know what?  XM has Major League Baseball.  We should get good tickets to the home opener.  Absolutely.  Danny should go in the garbage for his tickets.  I don't want to sit in a seat where you need binoculars.  And his pay.  That's what he does around this show.  You ought to just, you know what you ought to do, man?  You should have went to the game and then just insisted that you belong down front.  And you should have just kept pointing at yourself going, I am OB.  Do you know who I am? 
[03:03:30]  They just don't respect us in Washington.  They give us this fake respect.  Let's ask Elo on the phone.  Fake respect.  It's embarrassing, those tickets.  He's traveling?  Wow.  It's embarrassing.  He's probably going to Flushing to sit behind the dugout.  Yeah, he's going to the game.  Oh, he's at the Masters today.  Oh, is he?  In Augusta.  So, you know what?  Tough shit if you think differently.  It's embarrassing.  We're the hottest show on XM.  They say they're giving us tickets.  I'm seriously pissed off.  Yeah, I'm playing.  And I get better tickets from fans. 
[03:04:00]  They send tickets in and go, hey, dude, I can't use them.  And it's a box seat.  It's real nice.  You get treated nice.  Anus.  You think your own company that has the proper word.  Anus.  Put in your dick, pull out a turd.  There we go.  Very good.  Anus, where those tickets belong.  Shitty Mac tickets.  Fucking Elon.  Dude, how bad are they, really?  They're horrible.  You're fucking in right field somewhere.  So, what are you supposed to do as a real human being?  You're supposed to go, oh, wow, thanks for thinking of me. 
[03:04:30]  Thanks for giving me seats way in right field near the railing so I could see the car that I drove to the stadium.  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  Everyone's too nice.  We bring in a lot of money for XM and they should have, you know, did the right thing and got us good seats or said, ah, we couldn't get you good seats.  Instead of this horse shit.  Yeah.  In the middle of nowhere.  Fuck that.  Elo, you should call us really quick.  Elo, your fucking tickets suck a dick.  All right. 
[03:05:00]  And Sean and Georgia, if it wasn't for instant feedback, Opie would never get a single laugh.  Oh, that's got a, that's got a sprain.  That's going to leave a bruise.  Yeah.  That's going to put some ice on that.  Why don't they just call in with those comments?  Because they're a bunch of pussies.  And say, my name is, here's where I live, here's my phone number, and I would like to say.  Right.  You'll never get that.  All right.  What do you want to do?  We got the studio audience and some interesting things outside.  We got the.  I hear rumor.  I hear rumor.  What?  Of some stories out there.  You want to go to that? 
[03:05:30]  That's all I hear.  I hear rumor.  We also have Vanilla Ice rapping about taxes.  Can we please hear that?  Vanilla Ice tax rap.  I mean, obviously, we all grew up on the guy, loving him.  I want to hear what he's doing now.  So I'm just trying to say that deep and right field, they're good seats.  Are you kidding me?  You don't even know who's at bat unless you look up onto the Jumatron.  Are you insane?  They're not deep and right.  They're not good seats for a fancy gentleman.  It's not.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Everyone knows where the good seats are.  What is wrong with admitting that you're disappointed?  It wasn't like they were like down the third base line. 
[03:06:00]  You were hoping to sit behind home plate.  I was hoping to be able to tell who's at bat.  Behind home plate or right over your home team's dugout.  Are you on the ground?  That's fun.  Are you on the ground or are you up?  You're in like the fucking bleachers, right?  Way up.  Dude, it's embarrassing.  And you know Shea.  Shea, like, they stack them up.  That's awful, yeah.  You're up high and I'm not shitting about those fucking planes.  That stuff is scary.  And once again, you know what?  I know I sound like an asshole for speaking the truth, but tough shit.  No, you don't.  Tough shit. 
[03:06:30]  You sound like an anus.  Tough shit.  That's the proper words.  That guy was a fucking ghoul.  We should be stabbing Janet Leigh through a shower curtain.  The creep that sang that tune.  You guys can't see him, but he has like a fucking dark black awful hair and fucking ghoul  eyes and a Tony Perkins face.  He should get aged and stab Janet Leigh.  Because that's what happened with his penis.  And he put it in an anus of another man.  Let's say hi to Brian in New York.  Brian, use your hand. 
[03:07:00]  Brian.  What's going on, you anuses?  So you guys make good money and you guys bitch more than anybody I know.  First of all, that's right.  You know how hard it is to tote around our bank books.  Not for me, it's not.  You know, stop bitching about it.  You want some good fucking seats.  You think you need everything for free because you make good money.  All right.  Well, there you go.  You summed it up.  But that's not what this was all about.  Like, Elo made a big production out of the whole thing saying, hey, I'm going to take  care of you guys. 
[03:07:30]  Home opener.  I'm going to get you nice seats.  That's what was said to us.  And then they arrived and they're awful nosebleed seats.  It's embarrassing.  Sorry.  It is.  Hey, can we hear?  The company sucks.  I'll tell you right now, they stink.  Goodbye, mister.  They really do.  They got to start showing us some kind of respect.  We're bringing in so many fucking subscribers and they're paying every other fucking show  just ridiculous money and they can't even do this right.  Merger.  Fuck yourselves.  Right.  How you doing, Mel? 
[03:08:00]  Can we...  Merger.  You two fuck off and go to hell.  Can we...  How about that little song, It's Never to Blame.  I really feel that that's important.  That was a good song.  You want that too?  I think we should.  It's responsible.  What about the video I think?  We'll get to that right after.  We got still...  We got 40 minutes.  It's sing-along time.  Yeah.  All righty.  Yeah, I like that.  Maybe the crowd can chime in a little bit.  Yeah.  This is a fun one about, you know, if something happens to you, children, you're not to blame. 
[03:08:30]  It's not your fault.  It's not your fault.  It is, but they say it's not.  I like how the first part of it is, like, preventing anything happening, and then this  song is just, all right, it's over.  You've already taken one in the dumper.  Yeah.  All we can give you is this little bad song.  Yeah, that's it buggered.  If you've been buggered by a neighbor, this song may help you out a little bit.  If you were rogered by an older gentleman...  If an older gentleman gave you a roger... 
[03:09:00]  If you were your face in the backseat of a Plymouth in the fucking...  In the crook in the bottom of the seat, you know, the corner of the seat, and you were  crying with your little fucking granimals, and your little tough skins pulled down to  your brand new jock sneakers, here's a song that may help you through.  If the damage has already been done, if you've been belly sleeping since Tuesday, this song  may help you out.  It may not.  It's not like we're going to go back in and re-sew your asshole. 
[03:09:30]  Hey.  Got some groans.  Yeah.  Oh, cheers.  Just like the poor lad.  They were happy girls, though.  Bill in Illinois, what's up?  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Opie, get over it.  I got shitty seats at the Viner show, but I'm going to enjoy myself.  I'm going to play poker with Anthony, and I'm going to have a good time.  Why?  Because I love the show.  I love who's down on the stage. 
[03:10:00]  I'm going to have a good time, no matter how shitty the seats are.  All right, but were you giving the seats...  Get over yourself.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on, Bill.  Don't hang up.  We want to talk here.  You bought the seat yourself, right?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  That's a little different.  No, it is.  This is what we do.  Where are you going to the Vegas show?  I'm going to see where you're headed with this.  I'm very excited.  I know.  Which direction are you going to go with this one?  Now, watch.  Watch.  This is how it's done, though.  All right.  You're going to the Vegas show? 
[03:10:30]  You're going to hang up on me, right?  No, he's not.  I don't want to be predictable, believe it or not.  Bill, are you going to the Vegas show?  Yes, I am.  You're going to hold on the line, and I'm going to show you how it's done.  Club Soda Kenny is going to get your info, and we're going to fucking make sure you have  a great seat for the show.  That's how it's done.  That's how you take care of people.  All right?  And this is where I get hung up on?  No.  I swear to God, no.  Honestly, I hate your fucking guts, but I'm trying to make a point.  They'll put you on hold, and honestly, just stay on hold for a minute, and they will  get your info and give you better tickets. 
[03:11:00]  I just hung up on them.  Did you, Anthony?  Oh, Anthony.  Wow, that's a rarity.  Penis.  You should certainly feel like one.  I didn't know what this phone did in front of me.  I got some fun.  Click.  Done.  Bill, you're back?  Yeah, I'm back.  All right, it's back.  Listen.  No, I'm dead serious, because this is how it's done.  When you work for a company, and you do what we do for a company,  they should take care of us.  Sorry.  And they have Major League Baseball, so they get these tickets for free. 
[03:11:30]  And look, I know it sounds like Oprah's bitching, but when you're on a high-profile show,  and you're not getting the kind of money in the stratosphere of what Howard's getting,  and you're bringing money into the company, and they have baseball.  How about fucking Oprah?  One hour a week for a bloody fortune.  We're bringing in way more subs than stupid Oprah, and they tell us they're going to give  us tickets to the home opener.  I know I sound like an asshole, but trust me, this is some deep shit coming out now.  It's like, get us some fucking tickets that aren't in the nosebleeds in the middle of  nowhere. 
[03:12:00]  It's a fair request.  Like, when we give out tickets on our own show, like we're giving away Bob Saget tickets  over at the other joint, they're all good tickets.  You don't, like, give your fans tickets to something and say, well, it's the last row.  I'm sorry.  You just don't do that.  So, Bill, I'm dead serious.  I'm putting you on hold.  Everyone can see it.  Opie, you give this motherfucker a ticket upgrade, I'll shoot him on principle.  No, seriously, because I don't want to make a point.  Bill, we're going to get your info.  Club Soda Kenny's going to get a hold of you, and we'll make sure you're sitting a lot 
[03:12:30]  closer to the stage of Vegas on April 14th, okay?  Okay, we'll see.  No one believes me.  Just stay on hold.  Because they're expecting me to be the douche that I am, but there you go.  He's on hold.  Get his info.  It's never, you're never to blame.  Okay.  Never to blame.  I just say, never to blame.  You are never to blame.  You are never to blame.  You may feel shame, but all the same, you are never to blame. 
[03:13:00]  Michael just came.  You are never to blame.  So take this keister full of shame.  You'll never be the same.  I have to be done.  Can I play the song now?  All right.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Fucking came.  I don't know why I thought I'd have the fucking, I had the patent on that one. 
[03:13:30]  But I couldn't get that out for us enough.  You are to blame.  You may feel shame, but all the same, you are Chinese in pain.  He treated your ass like a dame.  All right.  We're going to see how long it takes for you to run out of steam now.  Now you got the obvious ones out of the way. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Go ahead.  This is the chorus again.  All right.  Feel shame, but all the same, you are never to blame.  It's only on the rug I have bad aim.  So are you.  Anyone else?  Anybody out there have one?  No.  Got one, Ant?  Huh?  Ant's doing a math problem to see if he's got one. 
[03:14:30]  I don't know.  I was thinking.  Yeah, well, let's get a bomb.  Go ahead, try it.  Who says you can bomb?  Don't be afraid.  Come on.  All right, hold on.  You got to do the song.  You got to do the song.  Yeah.  You are never to blame.  You are never to blame.  You are never to blame.  You may feel shame, but all the same. 
[03:15:00]  So let's go play some Monster Rain.  I liked where it came from for some reason.  I think here's the problem.  Here's why that bomb.  Let's dissect it.  I'll tell you why.  Because your eyes closed and you really tried to sing it.  Yeah.  Just fucking throw it.  Play some Monster Rain.  Yeah, yeah.  He was kind of kidding, but he really wanted to sing it well.  The singing shouldn't try to overshadow the joke.  Yeah, just spit it out.  Don't try to belt it out like a crooner.  You are never to blame. 
[03:15:30]  You are never to blame.  Although your ass is in flame.  Let's go to Bill in Illinois again.  Bill?  Yes, sir.  Hey, what do they do?  They took my name, my address, my email address.  There you go.  And that's it.  In Vegas.  And we'll be able to see you from the stage.  All right.  Goodbye, Bill.  Thank you for calling.  We'll see you in Vegas.  You are never to blame. 
[03:16:00]  But all the same.  You tell your mommy you'll get brained.  You know, it's a punch in the face joke.  As a kid, you just got fucked.  I swerved.  I should have to make it more gruesome than ever.  Or they'll put you on a milk carton and then you'll have fame.  Boy. 
[03:16:30]  All right.  Let's try this one.  It's all right.  Oh, you put it back?  Oh, we filed it.  I'm sorry.  Let's see what happens here.  Hold on.  Give me a second.  I like this.  I'm going to be humming this one all day.  You can just probably play You Are Never to Blame once, right?  You may feel shame, but all the same.  Your Star Wars sheets are all stained. 
[03:17:00]  Thumbs up, Sam.  Wait, hold on.  Oh, you got one?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I don't know about this one, but we'll give it a shot.  I have a bit ender coming.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  All right.  You may feel shame, but all the same.  Poke the colons, my game.  I like it.  Brian and Flores got one.  Brian?  Hey, guys.  How about that?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got to wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got to wait for the song.  So you hear the song drop out.  You jump in with your line.  Okay?  You got it.  You may feel shame, but all the same. 
[03:18:00]  You'll feel like you got shitty tickets to the game.  Wow.  I thought he was stumbling.  You stuck the landing, my friend.  You got it.  Thanks, Brian.  You got shitty tickets to the game.  Go fuck yourself.  And I said game.  How did I miss that one? 
[03:18:30]  Fuck.  I was looking forward to going Monday, too.  So that's why it's beyond disappointing.  I'm not sitting there.  Let the Puerto Rican sit there.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened?  You can laugh.  Don't worry.  There's one, and he doesn't even know he's Puerto Rican.  How about, what, here, Vanilla Ice now?  Oh, yeah.  Because this bit's getting lame.  Lame.  All right.  Vanilla Ice rapping about taxes. 
[03:19:00]  Oof.  This has got to be good.  Vanilla Ice.  Thanks.  Fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  I saw my rhymes like a bull.  Shoot him out like a narrow.  I swoop on suckers like an eagle, not a sparrow.  I tour around the world, spit my lyrics for dinero.  Pay my taxes on time, do the budget, make the payroll.  I walk a wide path, never, ever walk it narrow.  I step on stage, funky hip hop apparel.  I 1099, my employees like Will F***er roll. 
[03:19:30]  Get my refund, take my famo all the way out to Tahoe.  Business deductions from Miami to Palermo.  On April 15th, yo, you better be prepared.  So you learn before you burn or you end up like a proko.  Or do what I do and use that TurboTax mojo.  Audit defense, deduction maximizer, most trusted in the USA.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Let's just go home. 
[03:20:00]  How do you follow that?  I like it.  I like it.  It's got everything.  It's got information.  It's got a beat.  Guy's got his pipes still held up.  Oh, yeah.  He's singing about TurboTax.  Yeah, TurboTax.  I like the B-side.  Quicken.  Want to play, uh, know the audience?  Okay.  Yes.  Let's meet the audience.  E-Rock, uh, talks to the audience to see if there's anything good out there.  We don't have a lot of people.  We got, like, what, seven or so?  Uh, we got Gabe and Michelle. 
[03:20:30]  You two in the front, right?  Yes.  Couple on couch.  Uh, they're picking out their wedding rings today.  Oh, that's adorable.  Let's look at how happy they look right now.  Ugh.  What, when's, uh, the big day?  Uh, June 10th.  June 10th?  June 10th.  That's, uh...  How much money you got for the ring?  Uh, well, I already bought the engagement ring, so the wedding rings aren't that expensive.  Yeah, how much was the engagement ring?  What'd you, what'd you spend on that?  Uh, close your ears. 
[03:21:00]  Three months, Salad?  $100.  What?  $1,200.  I'm a cheap Jew.  That's $1,200.  You just heard $1,200.  That's all right.  I only spent, like, eight.  It's okay.  I knew he was a cheap Jew.  Are you a Jewish Jew, miss?  Partially.  And what's the other part?  Um, Catholic.  All right, good.  So I'm part Catholic and part damned.  What, uh, nationality?  Italian and German.  Ah.  That's interesting.  Part German, part Jewish.  A little inner conflict. 
[03:21:30]  No, German-Jewish.  Oh, you're German-Jewish.  Oh.  Do you like the show?  Great-grandparents?  I do like the show.  Grandparents have any interesting stories, tattoos, anything like that?  No.  Uh-huh.  Nope.  Hmm.  I was hoping to hear a few.  Train stories.  Any train stories?  No.  All right.  Just like that.  So they're, uh, getting wedding rings today.  We got-  That's wonderful.  Hey, Chris.  Good luck.  Chris in the Hooters, uh, shirt.  I'd like to see him in nine years.  I just would like to.  Not every-  Along my marriage. 
[03:22:00]  Not every marriage ends in a disaster there, Anthony.  No, it's just they look so happy.  They're sitting right next to each other.  They might end up, uh, being one of the lucky couples out there.  Once those nuptials.  You got a prenup?  Dude.  Uh, no.  No, huh?  No.  No.  What do you do?  Uh, computer tech.  Yeah, how old are you?  25.  25, computer tech.  You make a pretty good living, right?  But you're not, you're not, you know, a millionaire or nothing, right?  No, I'm not like you.  Yeah, see?  So you don't have to worry about it.  You got any hopes, dreams, aspirations?  You'll want to be a computer guy your whole life in this job?  You have no dream of being something, like if you fantasize in your head about the ideal 
[03:22:30]  dream job, uh, something you want to do, what would it be?  Uh, to have a better position in computers.  That's it, huh?  Are there people running around like this?  Yeah.  I never fucking worked a day in my life where I wasn't thinking, how the fuck could I get  out of this and get a job that isn't really working?  I, I just never, never thought of it that way.  You're dedicated.  That's nice.  What if something happens?  What if you win, uh, the lotto? 
[03:23:00]  Uh, then I will not be working anymore.  And then, and then, God forbid, you end up hating each other.  I don't mean breaking up and sitting there and shaking each other's hand, movie breakup  and going, I'll always remember you, but I need time and this and that.  I mean, hey, you fucking cunt, and she's calling you an asshole and fucking, all that shit.  By the way, that's not equal.  And you break up evil.  Those two aren't equal.  Yeah, asshole.  And then she goes, I want half of the lottery winnings.  What'll you think?  Uh, hmm. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, I'm Jewish.  I probably run with the money.  Yeah.  See?  But you'll be, you'll be, you'll have to go to court and everything.  How, why don't people get prenups?  Prenups would not stop a lottery winning while they're married anyway.  Prenup could stop anything.  Prenup can stop anything.  Can I jump in here?  Maybe she makes all the money.  What do you do, sweetie pie?  I'm a, I'm a graphic designer and a personal trainer.  Ah.  See?  Ah.  Who makes more money, really?  She does.  It's close.  Yeah?  No, you don't?  It's, it's kind of, it kind of evens out.  You're a personal trainer? 
[03:24:00]  Yes, I am.  Swim walk.  What was I doing?  Are you, swim walk?  There goes Jimmy showing her how to swim walk.  What are the benefits of swim walking?  Um.  Show her, show her a little swim walk.  And, and, and, you could kind of say what muscles it works.  Here he goes.  Now, what does that do?  I have never seen that before.  Keeps you physically fit and of course you haven't.  How much do you charge for a session?  Um, it's a sliding scale.  It depends on the person and where they're located.  Are you in New York?  I am. 
[03:24:30]  Um, my girlfriend and I wanted to get personal trainers.  She suggested I get one.  But I don't think she was being insulting.  I don't think she got a personal trainer.  She, you know, we were lying in bed nude and she pinched my fat stomach and said,  do you need 50 bucks a week?  And I'm like, what do you mean?  All right.  Well, good, good luck to you.  Thank you.  All right.  That's good.  We got Chris the, uh, the trucker in the Hooters, uh, shirt.  What's your wedding song?  Sorry.  You got picked out?  Uh, you really got me by the kinks.  No, stop it.  Really?  It should be, you are never to blame. 
[03:25:00]  This way, when you argue, you can both just kind of, you know, remember that one.  You are never to blame.  That's right.  Uh, trucker dude, anything?  No, I just want to say Jimmy Rock last night at the cellar.  Oh, you were down there?  Great.  Yeah, I kind of went in and did some jokes.  Cool.  Yeah.  Jimmy's hometown club.  If you're in the New York area, he's there almost every night.  But, but, but, you only do like 10 or 15 minutes because you've got to get a lot of guys on  stage.  Yeah, yeah.  Colin was on after me and Bobby Kelly was there.  Yeah, nice lineup every night.  Oh, the laughs we had upstairs. 
[03:25:30]  The usual suspects.  I like to call them.  Cut it out.  Yeah.  Uh.  What else do we have out there?  We have a gal over here.  Well, we got, we got Zach and Cheryl.  Who's Zach and Cheryl?  It's a mother, uh, son team, right?  Good.  20 feet apart.  That's healthy.  A loving relationship.  That's good.  Don't embarrass me, Ma.  Stop it.  You're described as the portly gentleman in glasses.  Wow.  That'd be me.  And you're, you have an emo band.  You're a bassist in an emo band called Nigel. 
[03:26:00]  Yep.  And his mom brought them up from Nebraska.  Do you, all the band?  Do you cry because you play, you play a bass in an emo band?  No.  Yeah.  I would think you would just cry and go, why can't I be the lead guitarist?  I'm so emo.  I'm not talented enough for that.  What's your, uh, what's a big song you guys have?  Um, probably Prom Dress.  It's called Prom Dress.  Prom Dress?  You're in an eat more band. 
[03:26:30]  I'm just commenting on, he's portly.  That's all.  And funny that E-Rock called him portly in the description.  I know, E-Rock, who was jogging in the other studio and his fucking forehead was shaking.  Boy, that was just when he stopped weighing him.  I'm fucking kidding.  He has a face like a pound cake.  I've had enough of Eric.  That fucking straw hair.  Did you bring the song Prom Dress?  Fucking awful.  It's like a meatloaf with straw on it.  That's what his fucking head looks like.  Stupid cap.  I like to remove it with a lead pipe. 
[03:27:00]  You are never to eat.  Did you bring your song?  No.  Oh, boy.  No.  How are you supposed to promote it?  How do you do that?  You're going to be on a big radio show.  You can get some air time with your music and you don't bring it.  Got a website?  What, are you making a date with him?  All right.  Jesus.  Just getting his MySpace address.  Oh, are you?  So I can make a date with him.  All right.  We might play a little bit of Prom Dress. 
[03:27:30]  Dan was whispering.  Dan was getting all mad at me.  He goes, so I could make a date with him.  He's doing my job.  I love these wireless mics.  And why did your mom bring you to New York?  Just for vacation.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What are you guys doing while you're here?  This is like, I wanted to come here.  Yeah.  And she wanted to go to see the Today Show.  Ew.  Wow.  Boy, I'm sure she'll change her opinion after this fucking debacle.  Two idiots arguing about the Middle East and fucking these two getting married.  What a nightmare this show is. 
[03:28:00]  I'm sorry, madam.  You had to endure this.  And me bitching about almost good seats.  I know.  He rips up fucking opening day tickets.  He's a millionaire.  Did you go to the Today Show?  Yeah.  We went yesterday.  Did you get...  Well, that's the Yesterday Show.  Yeah.  See?  See?  Fuck.  Did you get right up front?  Yeah, we got right up front.  Did you hold up a sign?  No, we didn't bring a sign.  Were you talked to by anybody?  No, but we got to shake Al Roker's hand and Matt Lauer. 
[03:28:30]  You did?  Matt Lauer, too.  Yeah.  So that was like kind of a thrill for you?  That was nice, yeah.  Was it on camera or off?  On camera.  On camera.  So you were on television yesterday?  Yes, we were on television.  A TV star.  They didn't ask where you were from or anything?  No.  Just a quick shake.  You should have held up a sign that said, hello, Fallujah.  All right.  It's like a shitty place that you're having to run.  All right.  Or hello, Compton.  You're not a big white lady.  By the way, this is leading to something.  This is just babble.  We love getting to know what our listeners are all about. 
[03:29:00]  We're going to hear some of this young man's...  But we wouldn't have done this if we didn't have a doozy out there.  Is there a Lulu?  There's a Lulu.  But first, we got Joe.  He's a professional wrestler.  Joe?  What?  Where?  Stand up.  Let me see you.  Stop it.  You're a professional wrestler?  You're not.  Sam is bigger than you.  You are just about the size of Sam.  I'm sure you got moves and all, and I wouldn't fuck with you.  But, I mean, wrestlers are a lot bigger than you. 
[03:29:30]  Nowadays, you can be a smaller guy.  What's your move?  My finishing move?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has a bear trap.  He snaps on their cock when they go to grab, but he tackles them.  He's better.  No, what do you do?  You're a little fella.  You take jujitsu?  No.  No, just pro wrestling.  Just train for, you know, two years.  What's your finishing move?  It's called the New York Minute.  I grab the guy in a full Nelson run and face-plant him into the mat.  Oh, can you do that to E-Rock?  He's a big wrestling fan.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  He wants to deliver the New York Minute to you.  E-Rock.  Tell everything what we do with this fucking tight shirt. 
[03:30:00]  God, I hope we paralyze E-Rock today.  How funny would that be?  Hey, could you remove his fucking R-Gang hat with a spin kick?  Is that possible?  That fucking spanky hat makes me sick.  She'd be throwing her on a baseball with Ty Cobb and that fucking hat.  E-Rock.  E-Rock drives home in a car that's powered by a dog chasing a cat on a conveyor belt.  E-Rock's going for this.  E-Rock, you all right?  Don't hurt Eric.  Don't hurt Eric.  You all right?  Yeah.  Maybe do it in slow motion so you don't hurt the kid. 
[03:30:30]  He's a big fella.  I don't know if you can lift him all the way up.  No, no.  Don't hurt him.  Don't break his neck or anything.  We need E-Rock.  Who else are we going to fuck when we're tired?  Don't hurt him in here.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's a full Nelson.  All right, hold on.  Is this going to break his neck?  You know what you're doing?  It's a full Nelson.  What do you do, though?  Because Eric doesn't know how to fall.  His whole life is spent on the floor.  He has no idea how to get there.  I just take him like this, step to the side, run.  One, two, three.  Oh, oh, okay.  So you just drive his face. 
[03:31:00]  Do you go down, too?  Yeah, and I go down.  And on top of him, and he kind of like, it's almost like bulldogging a person.  Right.  You ever see how the cowboys grab the bull by the horns and kind of twist their neck  and drive the bull's face into the ground?  Yeah.  You kind of do that with the guy in a full Nelson.  You run and trip him and plow his face into the canvas.  Oh, and I'm like, oh, I'm so scared.  Don't do that to me.  And I dry-gulched him.  Dry-gulch.  You remember that?  Fucking this boy's life.  It's a basic move, but I don't want to do it out here and break his face  because I've already busted people's mouths. 
[03:31:30]  Hey, calm down there, tough guy.  I don't want to do that.  I understand.  If Eric fell face first and he got up and he was okay,  there's a big hole in the floor.  The economist looking up at us.  And what's the finishing move called?  It's called the New York Minute.  New York Minute.  And what wrestling organization are you affiliated with, sir?  House of Pain Wrestling.  House of Pain Wrestling.  Yes.  And where are these events held?  We have them in Sanford, North Carolina.  Where are you from?  I'm actually from Long Island, but I live down in Raleigh now. 
[03:32:00]  Okay.  All right.  I was going to say that's a long fucking way to deliver the New York Minute.  Wait a minute.  What's your wrestling name?  Or wrestling name.  What's your name?  Wrestling name.  Dirty Joe Puccini.  Nice.  Dirty Joe Puccini.  They got dirty Joe Puccini at the causeway.  Actually, me and my partner's actually used your brother's remake of the Godfather theme  for our theme music.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Very good.  You'll be getting a bill.  Okay.  Good luck, man. 
[03:32:30]  And I tease Paisan.  Now we come to Rob.  Rob, how are you?  Hey, Rob.  How you doing?  Rob's a, ooh, what kind of Mustang you got there, my friend?  Oh, I got, I don't have a, nothing like as good as what you have.  That's okay.  I'm just, I'm a big Mustang fan.  I have a GT.  You got the GT?  Yeah.  So what are we looking at?  About 350 horse on that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's all right.  Died to get one.  You'll just like the shirts.  Yeah.  So you have a Mustang shirt on.  That's why I commented.  I had the shirt about a year before I got the call. 
[03:33:00]  Ah.  By the way, Rob has the best story out there.  Ah, I know.  I just heard it.  He's got a Mustang.  It is?  All right.  Let's go home.  No?  I want to go home.  He's got a better story than that?  Yeah.  Rob, you want to tell everybody?  Right.  What you told D-Rock?  Let's listen up.  You can hide your head in shame if you want.  No, when I was 14 years old, I was molested by a woman.  I don't know if you would call it complete molestation, but I used to hang out at this  apartment complex out where I lived, and you're never to blame, by the way. 
[03:33:30]  There was always this woman who would hang out with all the kids, and she seemed pretty  normal, but she always used to come on to me, and I didn't think anything of it.  How would she come on to you, by the way?  How would she come on to you?  How would she come on to you?  She was a hell of a lot nicer to me than she was to everyone else.  Even at that 14, you could tell there was something going on.  How old was she?  She was like 28, 28, 29, and she had a two-year-old kid, and that's where it gets interesting.  So we used to hang out with her all the time, and even the people I used to hang out with  knew that she really was looking to do something with me, so they would always hang around to 
[03:34:00]  make sure she didn't, and at one point somehow we ended up alone.  Can I slow you down for a sec?  Did you want something to happen?  At 14, absolutely.  Yeah, thank you.  Absolutely.  That's why I don't know if you would call it molestation, but what did she look like?  That depends.  She was decent.  I mean, she was, you know, at 14 I really didn't care.  Was she skinny?  Was she a big girl?  Nah, she was a little thick, but she was, you know, she was a lot bigger than me.  She was like six feet tall.  So Miss Bimmel was after you?  She kept asking if you could massage the diamond cuts in her back.  But she, we ended up alone at one point, and she basically, you know, we talked, and she 
[03:34:30]  grabbed me and threw me on the couch, and meanwhile her two-year-old's in the room.  So, this is where it gets funny.  Hysterical.  She, you know, starts going down on me, and I'm like frozen, because this has never really  happened to me before, so I like freeze.  And I'm looking over her head as it's going, you know, up and down, and I see her kid, 
[03:35:00]  and right there I'm like, oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  So, and the kid's walking towards us.  Yeah, his cock out.  Oh, I didn't know I was feeding Ty.  It was so embarrassing.  It was bigger than mine.  Well, his mother's doling out the Hummers.  So, he turns around, and he got close, and I'm like, I still, I was frozen at the point.  Punched him in the nuts.  And he gave me a good swipe in the balls.  Oh, fuck.  He did.  Yes, he did.  I jumped.  And then she, because she obviously had her eyes closed, she didn't see him.  So, she grabs him, and she's holding him back, and she just keeps going. 
[03:35:30]  And she just, and the kid's like, you know, trying to, and she's got him by the head holding  him.  Sexy.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I was like frozen, I didn't know what to do.  God, so she obviously did this a lot, the kid knew.  Yeah, the kid comes up and socks him a ball.  Like, what the fuck?  Ah, go chase yourself.  It's a fidget.  It looked like a bottle.  She didn't know what it was.  The kid probably thought his mother was feeding, and he was hungry.  We ended up, you know, at that point, I, you know, grabbed her and just brought her in  the room and slammed the door. 
[03:36:00]  Leave the kid outside by the side with the hand.  With some matches and fucking tweezers and a socket and whatever else.  And then she used to come by my house once in a while and drive by to try to say,  oh, I used to like duck and run into the backyard.  Yeah, why would you want to acknowledge the woman who blew you?  What's the matter with you?  He pushed a baby away to suck your dick.  What a good egg.  Yeah.  Did she get caught or anything?  Anything happen to her?  Not that I know of.  I just stopped hanging around after that.  You did?  How long after that were you having sex again?  It took about a year.  A year, huh? 
[03:36:30]  I was like a little, yeah, I was a little, I'm still in this day.  It's like, you know.  Are you fucked up?  One of those things you never forget.  Are you fucked up because of that?  Nah, not really.  I mean, it's just one of those.  The friend's nodding and saying, yeah, all right, give the mic to the friend.  He can only come.  Why do you think he's fucked up, brother?  I got a mess.  Why is he fucked up?  He can only come with the smell of shitty diapers in the room.  He can't come without little hands hitting his balls.  Fuck, he would have had a field day outside the elevator at Free FM.  The fart I let go with all the rotting diapers.  That was truly disgusting. 
[03:37:00]  I couldn't even enjoy that in a humor way.  I was like, this is revolting.  Do I do this to people?  My apologies, fellas.  I had a lot of vegetable juice yesterday.  Sweetie.  Your brothers?  Yeah.  So you remember this?  Nah, he was a lot younger.  He was a lot younger than younger.  Oh, so you don't remember.  You don't remember the girl or anything.  He's going to this place.  Okay.  He wasn't there that day, but he definitely remembers it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You don't have any stories like that?  Didn't run in the family?  All the women chasing after young kids?  Nah, I fucked my girlfriend's boss. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, wow.  You know, the sexist mind I have, I always have the image of a boss as a man when it's  first said.  I think that's why you said wow.  Yeah.  So right when he said the boss, I'm just thinking of Flintstone.  You know, that type of boss.  Mr. Slater.  And he's in there fucking, yeah, Mr. Slater.  Yeah.  It's Mr. Spacely.  Oh, Spacely.  No, Jetson Spacely.  Slate.  Flintstones?  Yeah, Slate was Flintstones.  What about mom?  Mom?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Now, what kind of job did that?  I want to know.  You fucked the girlfriend's boss.  What was the boss? 
[03:38:00]  My girlfriend's a dance teacher who's the boss of the dance studio she worked at.  Nice.  The boss of the dance studio.  So how did that transpire?  Yeah, how did that happen?  She was like 41 and we were all kind of close because it's a small studio that they work in  and I used to help her out a lot, you know, when I was done with my regular job and we  just really got close and one day we were working out in the studio and she just came  up behind me and tried to tell me I wasn't stretching properly.  What were you, dancing?  No, no, just like working out.  Fucking faggot. 
[03:38:30]  He's Leroy in fame.  Leroy in fame.  Were you on the ballet bar?  Did you slip the digit up your ass?  So yeah, you had a little experience with her in the dance studio?  Yeah, in the dressing room behind the dance studio.  She took me back there and we started fucking.  So that's not being faithful to your girlfriend?  No, it's not.  What type of way is that to behave?  It's a horrible way.  She knows.  She found out.  I don't appreciate that type of behavior at all.  She break up with you?  Jimmy. 
[03:39:00]  Huh?  She break up with you?  No, we were about to break up and then my grandfather died and she kind of felt bad and stuck with  me.  Then he went out with his friends in a car and fucked her on the Verrazano Bridge.  Then he fucked his funeral director.  Hey, is mom shocked?  You all right over there, mom?  Yeah.  They don't do this on the Today Show now, do they?  No.  I listen to this on the radio too.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Hey, back to your son's band.  We got his song Prom Dress.  Oh.  It's the band Nigel. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  And we got some kind of poem in front of us.  What's this?  Oh, that's something that I think we, that's the lyrics, but that's like a picture thing  that we made for our MySpace page.  You want to read the lyrics?  No.  No?  I don't.  Where's the name come from?  Jimmy's very good at reading poems.  I'll describe the picture here.  There's a young lad, there's three lads.  The young blonde boy looks a little rebellious, maybe about 16, 17 years old.  How old is he?  Um, 17. 
[03:40:00]  Okay.  He's got a rebellious, like a young DiCaprio looking ahead, bit of a challenging look on  his face.  You know, if you need some business, you come this way, mister.  And the two gentlemen are behind him, yourself.  You have kind of like a mop hair, like a bit of a mop do with glasses.  And you're peeking into his ear.  You're giving his ear a little peek.  And there's another gentleman who will be behind him to his right, looking up to the  right into the stars, as if to say, eh. 
[03:40:30]  Would you cut these pictures out with Microsoft paint?  What did you do?  Oh, that's great.  You could Photoshop this a little better, my friend.  I don't do any of the Photoshop.  Oh, wasn't you?  No.  Someone's to blame.  What was this kid watching?  Why is he looking up in the sky?  It's kind of, it's like a Green Day posters they have.  That is like the thing that they had.  Yeah?  Their base player was looking at him, and then the other one was like looking away.  Is it an homage, a rip-off, or you accidentally did it? 
[03:41:00]  Rip-off.  Okay.  All right.  Why are you looking in his ear?  I mean, he's a good-looking kid, though.  You're looking at his profile going, ooh.  Holy Toledo.  What's that kid's name, that 17-year-old?  Jordan.  More importantly, when is Jordan 18?  Ma!  Give him a kiss.  Ma!  Hey, let's play prom dress.  Nigel is the name of the band, right?  Yeah.  This is prom dress.  Debut.  You're on XM Satellite Radio.  Debuting for two countries, my friend.  Huh?  The pressure's on.  The pressure's on.  That's right.  Huh?  Eh? 
[03:41:30]  Eh?  Emo?  Oh, it's emo, right.  All right.  I'm Tim.  I'm Tim.  I'm Tim.  Oh, it's emo.  Oh, it's emo.  Thank you.

[03:43:30]  It's already morning  You're still in your progress  I hope that you feel guilty  Don't bother to close your eyes  It's already morning  You're still in your progress  See, I'm not  Travis knows  Emo  Hold on  Why don't we get Travis in here  Where's Travis?  He's the  What?  What did you do?  Put the shades down 
[03:44:00]  Travis, you know  Jimmy just put the shades down  Hold on, I'm just kidding  Hold on  You're a fan of the emo  I was kidding  I was kidding  You want an emo song?  Can I ask you  What's your name again, sir?  Zach  Zach, can I  I need your permission  Can I read some instant feedback?  Yeah, that's fine  Oh, now it's not fine  No, now you're good  I can't do it to the kid  No, let me  We all have hopes and dreams 
[03:44:30]  I can't do it to the kid  How old are you, Zach?  17  How long have you been in the band?  About a year  Okay  A year  It's a good band  Are you gigging?  Yeah, we  Where do you play?  What's your biggest gig to date?  It's always just around our  Our biggest one is  That concert is a live recording  Oh, that is a lot  I was wondering why the recording  It didn't sound like a studio thing  Okay  Because the music is actually good  The singing  I like the guitar that you play  And I like the  The bass is shit  But I like the guitar  And the  Oh, God  He's the bass player  He's the bass player  He's not a guitarist  No, he's not the bass player 
[03:45:00]  Big Duties  Jay wants to know  If they were all playing  Three different songs  Oh  Well, again  It's a live performance  They're probably jamming  And they're probably  Everyone that's talking  Is like out of their demo  Yeah  It's like, you know  This is music that probably  A classic rock guy  Isn't gonna fucking appreciate  Remember, this show's all about jokes  They're not gonna tell you if it's good  Yeah  It's so much easier just to, you know  Tear someone apart  Like, young gentlemen  This poem that's under the poster here  What is the poem about? 
[03:45:30]  Who wrote the poem?  That's the lead singer  And that's the lyrics  For what song?  For that song, Prom Dress  I'm sorry  Oh, it was  Was that Prom Dress?  Yeah  Okay  It was Prom Dress  I'll read some of the lyrics  There are exclamation points  So I'll read them appropriately  Under these fake fluorescent skies  We breed lovers  We breed liars  Before your very eyes  Exclamation point  Oh, exclamation point 
[03:46:00]  Yes  On this passage to paradise  We can put all of your hopes and dreams  On ice  Stop whining  Before your eyes  Shut up  Shut up  With perfect poise  And perfect charm  You take to the court  All arm in arm  With perfect precision  You walk to the floor  With your ones and twos 
[03:46:30]  You light it on fire  With the soles  Of your shoes  Shut up  Hold on a second  What?  That means  I want to clear something up here  Okay  What does that mean  You walk to the floor  With your ones and twos  Because sometimes  Artists when they write lyrics  Like this Jordan kid  With the kid with the steamy  Smoky glare  I want to know 
[03:47:00]  What this kid is talking about  What does that mean?  Dude, it's the prom, right?  Yeah  So you fucking walk to the floor  And you're thinking about dancing  You don't know about fucking  So they're like that  Kind of one, two, three, one, two  Oh, the one, two, two  I think you hate to piss and shit  On the way to the dance floor  You want to turn your twos  And now you light it on fire  With the soles of your shoes  You mean basically cutting a rug  To dance records  You're tripping the light fantastic  Frank in Massachusetts  And he writes  Everything all right  It sounded like a bunch of people  Burning in a fire 
[03:47:30]  What type of talk is that?  I think they're being a little harsh on Nigel  Steve is laughing a little too hard over there  Steve Carr  Now, Steve, of course  Foundry Music was a band site  And a staple  Before it was us  Staple of the show  Before it was an Opie and Anthony thing  It was a site about music  Right  Bands  Steve himself was in a band  Called Foundry  That's right  Some of the hits you may have known 
[03:48:00]  Pendulum  Anybody, of course  Ah, a little pendulum right here  Exactly  Now you'll be hearing some music  Ladies and gentlemen  Steve Stings from the next room  Steve Carr  It's called Reverb  Steve Carr  Reverb Pendulum  It's all mistakes  Who's playing guitar in this?  I am and a kid named Alan  Yeah  Now listen  Listen closely  We'll have a good mix  A little double bass drum  Happening there  You might want to remake this 
[03:48:30]  This song's about 10, 15 years old now  Very dynamic  At least I'm on key 
[03:49:00]  Around America  Fuck yeah  You can almost see the pendulum swinging  Yeah  Yeah  Steve Carr  And my gut swinging from side to side  At the time  You have a fat sound  It grows on you after a while  Oh man  Look Sam's rocking  I want this  Sam loves this song  Who wouldn't?  The pendulum be swinging back the other way 
[03:49:30]  Motherfucker  That's right  It's my third fucker  Get out of my way  Cause I'm 400 pounds  In a lame Brian truck  Oh yeah  We forgot about that  Yeah  Alright enough of pendulum  I'm wearing the living room curtains  Of a Puerto Rican  I'll tell you though  It never sounded so good  Yeah  What do you mean?  When stacked up against  That bowl of diarrhea  Oh wow 
[03:50:00]  Were you just calling Nigel  A bowl of diarrhea?  What's wrong with you?  Steve  The kid has hopes and dreams  He's 17  You know you remember  When you first started on the scene  Yeah you know what  The first time I handed something  Of the equivalent of Nigel's tape  To somebody  When I was working in Nashville  I handed it to someone  At  An A&R guy  I think it was at  MCA Deca  He said  Never hand this to anyone  Again  And that was it  He was just  He was like adamant  And it was of that quality  Wow 
[03:50:30]  So what you need  My friend  Is brutal honesty  Don't hand that  To anyone ever again  The fact that  A couple million people  Just heard it  Oh no  Steve  Wait a minute  No that is how  You address somebody  If he's resilient  He will re-record  They're not resilient  They're emo  They cry  He's a young man  They cry  This could lead to a hit  If he cries  Not even  If you go home and cry  Travis is saying  For the record  Steve's getting a lot of aggression out  I know 
[03:51:00]  Did you know  You should not have handed that in  And we can't read your mind  When you want  Discs in front of you  Wow yeah  It's all disconnected  This should be aimed that way  I think  Someone told Steve  This exact speech  Back in the day  I just said that  Steve  You didn't say like  I don't care for the song  You said and I quote  This bowl of diarrhea  Yes  Do you understand  That's worse than shitty  Because diarrhea is disgusting  And to have a bowl of it  Means it's all been captured  In one small area  For someone to look at 
[03:51:30]  And possibly smell in it  Yeah a tablespoon  Alright  But a whole bowl  Who fucking shits  Diarrhea into a bowl  It's like a  It's like a spaghetti strainer  Of cancer  Oh my god  Holy shit  Dude  The kid is looking at us  He's hoping  He's probably a fan of the show  Wants us to like his song  I like it  Come on Steve  It's got potential  It's  Potential 
[03:52:00]  You said it was  It's a crock pot  Full of skin tags  That's a step up  This is diarrhea  Can be reshaped  Continue giving the kid advice  What else you want to tell him there  He's looking at you  He's emo  He's sad  Poor kid  You could re-record that  With a different singer  What's wrong with the singer  It's off key dude  He's young  Look at the steely blue eyes  What age is going to make him  Find the right notes  Maybe not  Alright fuck them  There was sort of an issue 
[03:52:30]  With the singers  Have you ever noticed that  Or has anyone ever told you  That the singer  Might have like a pitch problem  We all  Like everyone always says  That they like our singer  He says it's unique  To like our music  Girls say that right  Yeah  Yeah  He's handsome  He's got a good look  But  I hope this kid's  The next Kurt Cobain man  And we just missed it  He transforms the music  And just shoots himself  This Jordan 
[03:53:00]  This Jordan  Is an anchor  Around your right looking neck  I don't like him  Put a black kid in there  He'll work harder  We like the bass in the song  Right  The bass was terrific  The bass was fine  Well why didn't you say that  It's like a bowl of diarrhea  With good bass  That's all encompassing  With a good bass  Alright way to put a flower in it  Yeah  A bowl of diarrhea  With a daisy  With a daisy  Shaped like a bass guitar  Just once I want to see  A bowl of diarrhea  Now I need to see  One bowl of diarrhea  It looks a lot like chili  A lot like chili  Yeah with little 
[03:53:30]  Grape skins in it  Oh god  Bits of chewed up hot dog  And some peanuts  Alright are we ready to do line of the day  Maybe a tooth  Hey what's the MySpace account  People are asking for it  MySpace.com slash Nigel Rock  Nigel Rock  N-I-G-E-L Rock  One word  I like it  Mom you proud of your son  Yeah  There you go  Have you seen  Have you seen Nigel live  Yes once  And  They were pretty good  Yeah but what's  Pretty good  What's that mean  Pretty good  It might not be  They don't practice all the time 
[03:54:00]  They've probably only performed  Five or six times  So I mean they need a lot more work  But what do you like to listen to  Maybe you don't like the emo  Okay  Yeah they're okay  Well what's your favorite like  Type of music  Peter Cetera  I like classic rock  Peter Cetera  Southern rock I'm thinking  A little southern rock in you right  No I don't like southern rock  Oh boy I missed that one  Like wait a minute  I'll bet if I put on some  Fleetwood Mac right now  I'd like Fleetwood Mac  Yeah see I hate them  I'll never get to his MySpace page
