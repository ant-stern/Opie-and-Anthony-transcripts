<pre> Big 70s ending, yeah!  Couple of explosions.  The Rock of New York 1027WNW.  I can't tell you how many people just called saying, who is that?  That rocks.  Come on, it's the Motor City Madman.  It's Uncle Ted.  Ted Nugent.  The Nugent.  Stranglehold.  Off Great Gonzo's, which is, I forgot how good this CD was.  Yeah.  The back of it.  Cat scratch fevers on this doggy dog. 
[00:30]
 Free for all.  Stranglehold, of course.  Baby Please Don't Go, which was cool.  Wango Tango and Wang Dang Sweet Poon Tang.  Now Ted's spending all his time jerking his meat.  That's what he does now.  I saw it on VH1, I believe.  They had a little documentary on him.  On Behind the Music.  Yeah, and he just makes beef jerky now.  Yes.  He hunts.  He gets this deer and venison jerky.  He makes jerky.  He jerks his meat. 
[01:00]
 He also was in our business.  Yes.  He did a talk show in Detroit.  He got fired recently.  I saw Saturday Night Live this past weekend.  Did you see it?  A guy, one of the cast, I don't even know who it is, doing Ted Nugent.  And he's got the bow and everything.  And at one point in the show, I was dying, he shoots Prince as Prince is performing 1999  right in the chest with an arrow sticking out of his chest.  Awesome.  The Hunter.  Totally awesome. 
[01:30]
 Cool.  All right.  We were in a high powered meeting for the last two hours.  So Anthony's hungry.  He needs food.  Yeah.  Well, aren't you too?  I'm hungry as well.  Bring us food.  Bring us food.  I don't want to eat anything people bring us.  Why?  We'll have like, Ben the Fag, you know, try it out.  Like the food tester.  Yeah, he'll be the food tester.  The royal food tester.  We'll bring Ben the Fag in if he eats it and he doesn't die, then it'll be OK for us. 
[02:00]
 All right.  We are hungry.  Someone send us food.  We usually get here and we prepare for our show by going out to lunch.  We were able to do that today.  Oh, no.  High powered meetings today.  Did you learn anything?  The brass.  I was upstairs.  You know, be upstairs.  We were called upstairs.  That's never a good sign in the corporate world.  Scott's office.  Yeah.  Showed us his new bat.  Yeah.  I don't know what that meant.  At least when he was talking to us, he didn't walk around us with the bat like last time. 
[02:30]
 That's just a scary feeling.  And he's behind us with the bat.  He tends to walk around this place with his bat.  Yeah.  The big, you know, the time we had that huge fight with Carol Miller about three or four  months ago.  Yeah.  He comes walking in the studio with the bat.  With a bat.  And goes, is there a problem here?  No problem anymore, sir.  No.  But he didn't realize at the time that he was holding the bat.  He just realized he had to come down here and take care of the problem. 
[03:00]
 That's what he says.  I think he knew he had the bat.  Okay.  All right.  So please, please, please, we beg you.  We need food.  All right.  We'll eat anything.  Okay.  Fresh bounce.  That's my close two.  Which was just a little lift I needed to get me bouncing on with my day.  What the long-lost?  Fresh set of bounce into your morning.  And have.  Beautiful.  One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York with Rush. 
[03:30]
 Before that, in my opinion, the best track off the new REM CD Up, song called Lotus.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  I must admit I'm a little sad today, Anthony.  Well, I would probably know why.  No bit here, really.  It has to be because of the Brazilian financial crisis. 
[04:00]
 I knew you were a little choked up about that.  You see, that's why you're sad today.  Oh, yeah.  Because that's affecting the stock market, I heard.  Well, yeah, a little bit.  How does that affect the stock market over here?  I don't get this whole world economy.  Well, we have some money invested in Latin America.  Not much in Brazil itself, but if Brazil goes, what's next in Latin America?  Opie.  A lot of assets down there.  A lot of the banking stocks took a hit today. 
[04:30]
 One thing I didn't understand, the Internet stocks, which is pretty much an American thing.  There's not much problem with other countries interfering with those things.  But those take a dump, too.  I'm hearing that there's some money to be made in the foreign Internet stocks.  Oh, really?  Oh, yes.  Wow.  That's starting up as if the American ones aren't risky enough.  You're going to jump into some Asian Internet stocks or something. 
[05:00]
 Now, do you have any money in Nike today, Anthony?  No, but I would guess they took a bit of a hit.  I want to know how bad of a hit they took today.  I read they took a nasty hit on Wall Street because of the retirement of Michael Jordan.  Really?  Which made me very sad today.  Is that what made you sad, Opie?  I think it's our Babe Ruth retiring.  Yeah, this generation's Babe Ruth just retired.  I'm having a hard time believing that he's retired for good. 
[05:30]
 I think he's got another year or two in him.  Well, he kind of left it open, saying he was, what, 95% sure that this is the right decision  to make.  Well, he knows in his heart it's the right decision to make now.  But with Michael Jordan, he has the right to change his mind and he just might do that.  Don't play the market, Opie.  Nike up a quarter, 42 and a quarter.  No kidding.  Yeah, because it was down yesterday with the rumors of Jordan retiring.  Well, I don't know.  It made a rebound today.  It did. 
[06:00]
 All right.  But it was just a very surreal thing to watch him retire today.  I didn't find it as touching as his first retirement speech.  I know what it is.  When they retire a second time, it's just kind of the wind is taking out of it.  I think that's why he just might come back again.  I don't want to start the conspiracy theory, though.  But if this was truly completely it without a doubt for Michael Jordan, why wasn't his  family there?  Why weren't the players around him?  Where was Phil Jackson?  As much as Phil Jackson hates the management of the Bulls, you would think he'd make an 
[06:30]
 appearance for Michael Jordan.  Well, maybe because it is his second retirement.  Yeah.  It's like the second wedding.  You know, when a girl gets married the second time, you don't do the big white dress and  the whole thing isn't as serious.  You know, they kind of make jokes at the altar, stuff like that.  Maybe that's it.  But ESPN is doing 24 hours of Michael Jordan.  Oh, they're in hour number two right now.  Well, the fan is going off, too. 
[07:00]
 Michael Jordan.  Hey, how about that, Michael Jordan?  Hey, but how about that?  I don't know, Mikey.  Wait a minute.  Then the caller's got to come.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mike.  Michael Maddock.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm calling about Michael Jordan.  Yeah.  You know, what a class act this guy has been over the years.  I'm very sad to see him go.  This guy, a role model for all the kids.  And that's exactly what he was.  A fantastic role model for all the children.  Very, very professional.  We're not going to tell you somebody like this in very, very years to come.  And he's a very, very good actor.  He's a very, very good actor.  He's a very, very good actor.  He's a very, very good actor.  He's a very, very good actor.  He's a very, very good actor.  He's a very, very good actor.  It's just like a parade of the same calls over and over again. 
[07:30]
 That's great.  See, we'll dedicate one break to Michael Jordan today.  Maybe two.  You think his tongue's stuck to the roof of his mouth or something? 
[08:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[08:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  How could I truly satisfy his appetite for competition? 
[09:00]
 Yeah.  Parenting.  And being the best.  And parenting isn't, you know, it's not, it's not something that you need this extraordinary  talent to do.  I mean, well, it's a very difficult job to do it right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just, I just find it hard to compare the two and say, well, yes, now that I don't have,  I'm going to focus on raising my kids, which I'm sure he'll be excited about, but something  that bounce them around on the floor, dribble them something inside. 
[09:30]
 It's going to eat away at this guy.  It's rough, but maybe that's the price you have to pay, you know, for all the good that  you get while you're playing the game.  That's how frustrating it is when you have to leave the game.  Who knows?  So hats off to you, Michael Jordan.  Godspeed, Mike.  Godspeed.  Godspeed to you.  And all the Nick fans, because I am a true Nick fan.  I wouldn't be excited that Michael Jordan is out of the game.  I would, I would like to see the Knicks beat a Michael Jordan Bulls team. 
[10:00]
 Yeah, because now it's just, if it gets to that point.  You talk to the people on the streets of New York, everyone's excited.  Wow, now the Knicks have a chance.  Blah, blah, blah.  It's like, if you're a true sportsman, you want to, you want your team to beat the best.  Yeah, because they'll always say, well, they wouldn't have done it if Jordan was playing.  Yeah.  And simple as this, the season now is just a wash.  This doesn't matter.  No.  This doesn't matter between the lockout, Jordan retiring.  It's going to be stupid.  Bunch of guys out there that haven't been practicing.  Right. 
[10:30]
 But that's been rehashed enough.  So let's move on here.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  We had, we had the Jets Chan in there.  Yeah.  And Rick is talking to the winner.  She was kind of lame though.  Yeah.  We've got to get her back on the air.  She can't even do the chant right.  She didn't do the chant right.  We're, we're giving you a chance to win a trip to see the big game Sunday in Denver.  And she was a little scared because she didn't want to shout at work. 
[11:00]
 Oh, Rick just hung up with her.  Oh, well, maybe Rick's not happy with her either.  Yeah.  She's like, okay.  I'm J E T S Jets.  Uh, got a couple of jets.  Yeah.  When you hear the Jets chant, we want you to be excited, enthusiastic.  Yeah.  You call up, we get you on the line and you just start screaming the jet chant and do  it right.  She said J E T S Jets.  It's not how it goes. 
[11:30]
 It's not how it goes.  Who doesn't know that you're letting Eddie down.  Eddie is known for the chant now.  Of course.  Fireman Eddie.  What's her name?  She's on.  Yep.  All right.  Let's see if she's learning.  Let's see if she's learned anything by listening.  Karen.  Yeah.  Okay.  Everybody wants to go to, uh, Denver to see the game.  Now, I don't know if we're going to qualify you.  Come on. 
[12:00]
 Come on.  Oh, my.  Come on.  I'll beg.  My Joey.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Now, now we're going to make you do the chance again.  Okay.  There are 20 lines lit right now.  Everybody wants this.  I mean, it's a good idea.  Now, do you know how to do the Jets chant?  Well, to be honest, I'm a big fan of hockey.  I'm a big fan of hockey.  My favorite sport.  We won't hammer you too bad. 
[12:30]
 Good.  We should give you the chance just for taking our abuse.  Okay.  Now, all right.  The chant goes J E T S Jets, jets, jets.  Okay.  Not J E T S jets.  Okay.  Say it like you're sitting in a cold stadium.  You just took a couple of nips off the flask.  All right.  Let's go.  Now go.  Jets.  J E T S jets, jets, jets.  Oh, no. 
[13:00]
 Come on.  Maybe she just doesn't have it in her.  Are you hot?  Am I hot?  Yeah.  Well, it comes down to that.  Yeah, I think I'm hot.  Well, good.  Let's get started.  We'll go to Denver.  Modesty.  I'm all right.  I'll try you on.  I won't.  Come on.  You're a torturer.  I know.  You're torturing me.  You're torturing me.  We figured if you could take our abuse that you deserve a chance to go to Denver.  Listen, I can take very much of your abuse. 
[13:30]
 Ask anybody that knows me.  One of my pet things.  Okay, Karen.  We're going to qualify you.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  We appreciate it.  Okay, bye.  All right.  There she goes.  Karen from New Jersey.  We hear the Jets chant.  You call up and we want you a little more excited than that.  Just a tad, please.  Yes.  We don't want to put you out or nothing.  God forbid that you get excited about a trip to see the Jets in Denver.  Only a trip to Denver.  You know, I want to beat the living crap out of a Bronco this Friday. 
[14:00]
 We should do that.  You think our marketing department could get this together?  Get some energy out.  I know we haven't given them a lot of time.  I know they need about a month, but the game is Sunday.  Right.  I want to have a Jets pep rally.  I haven't even talked to marketing about this.  This is just our idea that we just came up with.  Spontaneous.  And what are we going to do?  We want to broadcast a show somewhere Friday.  Yeah.  So we need to get sales involved.  Okay. 
[14:30]
 God forbid.  But got to find a location.  Right.  We'll be there live.  Okay.  I like it.  And we're going to find a Bronco and we're going to beat the living crap out of it with  sledgehammers.  I like that.  That should be something we can make happen.  Do you think the staff here at any W can help us out, Anthony?  I have confidence in that.  They can do that.  I'm sure they can do better.  I got a better idea.  Okay.  Let's do the same thing.  Only get a real jet and crash it into the Bronco.  They can do that too, right? 
[15:00]
 We'll fly a jet into the Bronco.  Sure.  We are going to challenge the staff of our lovely radio station here to make that happen  for us by Friday.  Yes.  We need an old Bronco.  We need a place to broadcast and we're going to have a pep rally and we're going to get  sledgehammers and beat the crap out of the Bronco.  We'll spray paint stuff all over the Bronco.  Yeah, like Elwigs, Bob Sox, big horse teeth bastards, socks, you know, stuff like that.  Yeah.  And then people will take turns just beating the crap out of a Bronco. 
[15:30]
 Yes.  We're going to try to make this happen because we're hearing from you guys.  You want to know what we look like and we've got to get out there.  All right.  We'll get out there.  We're putting out Ben the Fag and Black Earl at all these appearances.  Black Earl was a hit at the Black Crowes show.  They're getting mobbed now when they go out.  It's like, hey, look, it's Ben the Fag.  Hey, you fag.  Ben, you're a fag.  Hey, look, it's Black Earl.  He's black.  Hey, Black Earl. 
[16:00]
 That's what happens though.  We got to get out there.  All right.  So we're going to try to make this happen.  OK.  Wheels are in motion as we speak.  It's the new Opester.  Positive Ope.  I'm positive.  All right.  We're going to be positive.  Right.  If they don't make this happen, though, we're going to bitch and complain.  I'm positive.  OK.  Positive.  This ain't going to happen.  So once again, I'm kidding.  Of course.  Very positive.  Once again, sales staff and the promotion department and programming, they have to get together 
[16:30]
 somehow, someway.  Get us an old Bronco, a place to broadcast Friday, and a bunch of sled chambers.  We'll do the rest.  We're going to throw a Jets pep rally.  Oh, and the Israelis and the Palestinians have to come together in peace.  Throw that in, too.  Someone bring a cake.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from Collective Soul.  That's heavy off the CD dosage.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  We're coming into the studio and he told us that Roger, marketing director extraordinaire 
[17:00]
 for any W, is working on getting us a Bronco for Friday.  Yeah.  Huh?  At Giant Stadium.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Come on.  Really?  Kick ass.  If this gets pulled off, we can do this.  That will be great.  Yes.  Yes.  Indeed.  Came up with our first idea of 1999.  My head hurts. 
[17:30]
 We want to do a Jets pep rally Friday.  We want to broadcast live.  Looking like maybe Giant Stadium.  It's on?  Oh, no, no, no.  We're working on it.  Ben the fag.  Ben the fag.  What do you mean you're working on it?  I'm working on it.  Ben gets all nervous when he has to come in here now.  You work on it.  Oh, no, after the last time.  You work in the marketing department.  You work in the marketing department.  You work in the marketing department.  You work in the marketing department.  You work in the marketing department here at NAW.  We're in the process of working on it. 
[18:00]
 That's it.  Sometimes these things have to be done.  All right.  Looking around.  Looking around for certain people.  All right.  Yeah, we're trying to do it live at Giant Stadium Friday afternoon.  We're going to get a Bronco, maybe a bunch of Broncos.  We'll see how many Broncos we can get.  We'll settle for one.  We're practically giving them away.  We're just going to allow the listeners to beat the living crap out of this Bronco with  some sledgehammers and stuff and get psyched for the game Sunday.  Cool.  So keep listening to our show.  If we can pull this one off, I'll be amazed. 
[18:30]
 Yeah.  You know.  In a good way.  In a good way.  I'll be very happy.  Yes.  Okay.  The Rock of New York 1027WNEW.  Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Blue on black.  We've got to get a Jets qualifier here, Ant.  All right.  I'm very excited about this.  When you hear the Jets chant, you've got to call in at 2127571027 and you've got to do  the Jets chant yourself.  And if we're satisfied by your performance, we'll qualify you to see the Jets in Denver 
[19:00]
 Sunday.  We need some real motivation.  Hi, who's this?  This is Scott.  All right, Scott.  Don't let us down.  Karen kind of let us down last hour.  Oh, I won't let you down.  All right, Scott.  Here we go.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good.  That's the way you do it.  Now, where are you calling from?  I'm on my way home to East Northport.  Okay.  Hey, that's our neck of the woods.  Yeah.  Hey, if we have a pep rally Friday, will you come?  Yeah, absolutely.  We're trying to put it together last minute.  So.  I heard about it.  So keep listening for details.  Okay.  Will do.  Hold on the line.  Rick's going to take care of you. 
[19:30]
 All right.  Thank you.  Right on.  There you go.  No stadium full of people standing around.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  No stadium full of people saying it like that.  That's when it sounds like, know who the most famous person is through this whole thing  is Eddie, the fireman.  Right.  Who does the chant at the stadium.  Yeah.  You can't turn on the TV or open the paper without seeing him with his fireman jet hat  on.  Rally's up the crowd.  It sure does. 
[20:00]
 But no one kind of stinks.  What?  His brother is the one that has him on his shoulders.  His brother doesn't get any of the credit.  his brother hoist him up on his shoulders for those chants and no one gets to see the  brother's face really.  Oh, and there's Eddie living it up, you know, getting everyone quiet and he's in the limelight  and his poor brother, he just has him on his shoulders.  Some people are in the limelight and some are just the supporting players.  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  All right. 
[20:30]
 Now, what do you got on the jets over there?  Well, I'll be tickets flying out of ticket brokers in people's hands in Denver, Colorado.  $800, upwards of $1,200 for a ticket to the game.  Wow.  The Broncos Jets game being paid by New Yorkers.  And did you know that scalping is legal in Colorado?  I did not know that.  It is.  And they, this guy Bruce Brown in Colorado, we love New York, he says.  He's already sold 1,200 seats to Sunday's game for about two and a quarter up to $550 
[21:00]
 He says New Yorkers will pay any price for tickets because they're used to paying big  money to get the best seats.  It's part of your culture.  What?  Culture?  We're in the same country as you.  Like the grass skirts we wear and the bones through our nose.  Part of our culture to get ripped off?  It's not part of our culture.  We don't like it.  But you see in New York, we have good sports teams. 
[21:30]
 Yeah.  What does Denver have?  Oh yeah, the Broncos won last year finally.  And besides that, their teams suck.  Mr. Ed Tooth, Elway, Colorado, Rocky Mountain High, Jackasses.  And that was pretty good.  Thank you.  That was pretty good.  You know scalping is also legal in Jersey.  Legal?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Ticket scalping is legal in Jersey.  And Garden State based brokers are commanding top dollar for the game too.  Alright.  How about that? 
[22:00]
 Well we're going to send someone to Denver for free. 
[22:30]
 for my friend Buzzy.  Did you?  We wanted to go so bad as the Knicks playing the Spurs.  And the guys said to trust them.  I wanted to believe so bad because it was a sold out game.  So we jumped into the ATM machine area.  Not to get money out.  We already had the money on us and he showed me the tickets. 
[23:00]
 I think deep down I knew they were fake but I wanted to believe.  So we went for it.  How much?  $150.  It was like $75 a ticket.  So we get to the ticket guy.  He looks at the tickets.  He's ready to rip them and then he takes a second glance and I'm like done.  And then all of a sudden the security guard goes follow me.  Now I'm like what are we going to get in trouble for scalping?  Everyone scalps in this town right?  Maybe they're faking it. 
[23:30]
 They're taking us back to the refund area.  So they take us down to their little security area in the garden.  There's a line of people outside this office that all got used on this particular game.  So we wait on line and then they basically ask us to look at a wall of people.  Mugshots.  Mugshots and say which one was it?  And the guy that sold it to me was up there.  He goes oh yeah Eddie.  They know him by name and everything. 
[24:00]
 Used.  And then they escort us out of the building.  Unless you've been raped in New York you know.  So you're not really living here.  No that's true.  At some point.  Now a lot of people are calling up saying why are you guys jumping on the bandwagon?  You guys don't pay attention.  From day one since we moved back to New York we're from here.  People still haven't gotten that through their thick skulls.  We said that we're huge Jets fans.  Yeah.  We said even though this is like the Giants station we're not going to fake it. 
[24:30]
 We're big Jets fans.  Right.  Always have been.  Had Wayne Craben on the show a couple days ago.  Yeah.  So people you know the hardcore fans never want to believe if they hear people on the  radio saying that they're fans.  Yeah that's a guy you're bandwagoning.  Yeah you guys are jumping on the bandwagon.  Yeah.  So yeah.  All right.  We're arriving in New York 1027W&EW.  Black Curls from By Your Side kicking my heart around.  They rocked Irving Plaza last night. 
[25:00]
 Boys looking really really good.  They are those brothers still fighting.  Yeah they hint to that all the time.  Isn't that something?  It's just weird because they just both they just have completely different personalities.  Yeah.  Chris Robinson is very outgoing and witty and quick with the one-liners and stuff.  I don't know.  I've met him a few times and he just is not into it.  Really?  Well that's what he portrays that he's just not into it.  That's something. 
[25:30]
 Leave me alone.  Huh.  Seems a little bitter for some reason.  But they fight.  That's not.  But they came from the same gene pool which is kind of strange.  Not as bad as the Oasis the Gallagher brothers but they fight.  Yeah.  Oh look who's here.  Hey look look who's here.  Look at this.  Marco.  Mark from Maxim magazine.  Where do I put you?  It's been a while.  This is a beer.  Did you bring your own beer today?  Yes I did.  Yeah you did.  Alright cool.  Alright well we'll let Mark settle in and uh.  Let's encourage people to continue to supply us. 
[26:00]
 Okay.  We'll talk to Mark from Maxim next.  Alright.  He's always a fun guest.  He always comes up with some twisted crap.  Last time he was here.  You are constipated.  Are you still having nightmares from the last time you were here?  Last time he was here he watched uh.  What was her name again?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wilda.  Wilda.  Wilda.  A wilda.  A wilda.  A wilda ate a piece of stockbroker Dave's of a sectomy tube that he had taken out. 
[26:30]
 For Aerosmith tickets?  For Aerosmith tickets.  Yeah she ate it.  And Mark Golan you were pretty sickened.  I was near blinded.  Yeah.  This is from a guy whose pal was walking down the street one day and kicked a pigeon with  an army boot and it exploded and Mark laughed.  So a girl eats a piece of a sectomy tube and that set you off?  Well quickly as I was.  That's gross.  As a little warm up here tell the pigeon story because that's how we met.  We're like this guy is a sick ass. 
[27:00]
 We've got to get him on the show.  This was the first time after college when I was up here and uh.  Ended up finding this apartment that this woman needed a roommate to the village voice  and I moved in with her and so on.  We got this whole host of weird friends and we would get really drunk Saturday nights  and then go out on Sundays have brunch at six o'clock at night and she had this closet  on the floor of the building that she had that it was just a closet.  She actually rented it out to this guy from South Africa.  A six foot four inch guy named Udo. 
[27:30]
 And we're walking down the street one day and he all of a sudden says you want to see something.  I love it when people say you want to see something.  Of course.  Yeah.  And he had on these I mean he had like size 14 feet and these boots with steel tips on  them.  There was a pigeon and he kicked it so hard it just vanished.  I mean if it vanished I don't mean like it flew away.  I mean it was gone.  There was a beak lying on the ground and blood and that was it. 
[28:00]
 I've never seen anything like it.  Oh wow.  The other pigeons around started to pray to him as if he were an angry god.  It just made you disappear.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York.  It's open Anthony.  Hey look who's in the studio our pal Mark Golan.  Hey.  Editor in chief of Maxim magazine.  This could be his last visit because the magazine is so hot he's going to forget the little  people but.  Yeah it doesn't need us anymore. 
[28:30]
 It doesn't really need our support.  I forget clothes in the morning said the little people.  Yeah it's next to nothing.  It's amazing.  That magazine is the hottest in America right now.  Maxim.  Of course you two aren't little people.  You're two six foot tall women.  Secrets out.  Thanks.  Exposed.  For you.  Exposed our secret Mark.  Yeah it's kicking everybody's butt.  Everyone's trying to copy it now.  It's very satisfying.  You see it now.  You see the whole style of it.  Everyone's trying to copy certain other magazines. 
[29:00]
 Spent 10 minutes a day working on my smirk.  I saw Jugg's magazine for one trying to copy Maxim.  Right.  Yeah.  Swank.  Swank.  Yes.  Not quite legal magazine.  Yeah.  Well I love the latest issue.  The calendar section is hysterical.  My favorite.  Yeah this is we had so much fun.  It was me and the deputy editor Keith Blanchard were sitting at a bar just going.  I can't remember what it was but a whole bunch of the new calendars had come out like it 
[29:30]
 was September or October something like that.  You just know when there's stores that just around Christmas just the calendar store.  There's too many calendars out there.  You know there's one that's like puppy dogs and Jesus and they both have the same eyes.  And then there's like you know it's a supermodel calendar.  There's those middle earth calendars.  Yeah.  You know with Gandalf and crap.  Anyone you want.  Yeah yeah.  I got grandma the yarn calendar.  A calendar with different colored yarn.  It's just too many calendars. 
[30:00]
 A yarn for every month.  You don't need that.  Look look at the beautiful color on April.  So Max magazine twisted the colors.  Of course goofing on that whole thing.  Right.  Yeah.  So we just picked the ones that like we hated the Star Trek calendars.  Right.  So let's do the.  My favorite.  Let's do the Klingon prison calendar.  And so we got this artist to draw Captain Kirk. 
[30:30]
 Captain Captain.  Captain Crutch.  Captain Crutch.  Captain Kirk on all fours with a menacing Klingon figure behind him.  Ready to get it in the showers.  Filling full of tranya.  He's going to need some tranya after that episode.  My God I'm violated.  I can't believe it.  Captain Kirk.  You've been violated.  So we started with that one and then we're like well let's just keep going here. 
[31:00]
 And then we thought what about old people's mouths.  That's my favorite.  Tire calendar like close ups on really old people's.  Pruney.  Yeah very wrinkly.  Teeth missing.  It's beautiful.  And we have scary babies.  Scary babies was fun.  We have breakfast in Germany every month just like a big plate of greasy Wiener schnitzel  with a little German flag in the top of it.  Another favorite though was the. 
[31:30]
 What was that other one.  Oh.  I'm going to show you now.  Oh the.  Yeah.  That one.  There it is.  Yeah.  Wait a second.  Yeah.  It's sheep's asses of Scotland.  What was the copy on this?  This is pretty good.  When you're tramping over the frozen.  You know what if you do a good Scottish accent you got to read that.  When you're tramping over the frozen pit and north winds blowing up your kid.  There's nothing warms the heart like the sight of a wee sheep's crepe and two nether. 
[32:00]
 What?  To other way.  To other.  Twelve wooly comforters for your winter pleasure.  Good man.  It's sheep asses of Scotland.  That could be a good name of a band.  Sheep's asses of Scotland.  In every issue now we refer to sheep's asses. 
[32:30]

They want to come in and sit around while the editors kick around ideas.  No.  No you don't want to.  Of course not.  We want to talk about some of the ideas you're not allowed to put in the magazine.  Yeah what you've been working on.  We'll get to that.  We'll let you think about it.

Well they're doing the hotel thing now Mr. Shatner.  I know I was staying at a place on Rigel 7.  Cost me an arm and a leg.  I had to borrow money from Spock.  If only I had called Priceline.

Enthusiastic.  I like it.  We're going to qualify you for that trip.  Alright.  Hold on the line okay?  Okay.  Thanks a lot.

 Thank you.  Tell the other guy he's a loser.  Alright we'll tell him.  I won't give you my dirty work.  Dude.  Dude.  You didn't make the cut.  I got boned.  That's alright though.  The lady was much better.  Because she's a lady.  If you guys were three girls over there I think I would have got it.  No you got to know when you were calling up that we want you to yell.  Oh of course I've been listening the whole day.  And you couldn't yell but you called anyway.  Ultimately I want you to get fired.  Do we have a consolation prize for this guy?  No.  I think we have like a winger CD or something.  Winger?  She's only seventeen. 
[38:30]
 You improved your Christian now.  You guys your show doesn't get plugged enough.  Tell me about it.  The black crows.  If I hear that one more time which I love them though.  But you guys get no plugs.  They get plugs every five minutes on your station.  Well because they're the crows.  We love the crows.  Alright man hold on the line.  We'll try to get you something stupid.  Winger baby.  Alright hold on.  Winger baby.  Well we had to do that though because you know that girl Karen from Jersey.  We let her slide and the real Jets fans are really mad at us now. 
[39:00]
 They call up.  Yeah they get pissed.  Alright so we got Mark from Maxim magazine.  He likes to come in once a month but now that the magazine is getting huge I don't think  he'll be coming back anymore.  No.  He'll forget about us like everyone else does when they get big and famous and stuff.  It's true.  It's true.  But know what I liked about the latest issue of this magazine is that website.  Ah yes.  Oh there was a little nice lead in.  That was slick.  Thank you.  That website.  That website.  As you have it open to that website. 
[39:30]
 Right.  Jailhouse Rockettes.  That's the one.  We were doing what we do best which is wasting time looking around on the web for disgusting  stuff and found this.  It's called Jail Babes and basically it's a dating service for guys on the outside looking  for women on the inside.  Only in America.  This is great.  This is a guy, Ken Klein.  62 year old Ken Klein.  His comment is, I think there's a big misconception as to what these girls are all about.  Oh of course.  They've made mistakes and society says they have to pay by spending time in prison but 
[40:00]
 they're still human beings.  I'm trying to give them something to look forward to.  Anthony's on the site right now.  I popped it up.  Boy this is great.  I like this.  We have a cake 21 year old, Thrissey.  She enjoys traveling, dancing, well not traveling.  It's hard to travel.  She motorcross races and says she's a firm believer in loving from the inside out. 
[40:30]
 Well she's in the right place to love from the inside.  Oh my God.  What have we got?  Look I pop up the site and I get a sketch of a woman.  What's her name?  It's Kronique.  Oh it's Shaniqua.  I like Kronique.  She said Kronique.  She'll be getting out in 1999 this year.  She's getting out. 
[41:00]
 She wants somebody of any age, any race, doesn't matter.  She just wants someone to pay her bills.  Wait do we have a quote or something?  She's single.  She's a witty, sexy, fun, outgoing, caring, giving, intriguing, honest, mysterious and  definitely not your girl next door.  Yeah unless you live next door to the pen.  Know my way around cutlery.  I enjoy reading, writing, shopping, outdoors, sex, movies, rollerblading and swimming.  I'm hoping to find someone special with the same interest as myself. 
[41:30]
 I'm teaching men a lesson that they'll never forget.  Someone who I can be open and honest with.  Obviously she wasn't honest with somebody.  This is a great site.  Only in America though.  You don't see the Turkish prisons having a little website for their people.  Or Indonesia in between beatings or something.  Fendi is an 18 year old boy, thoroughly broken in.  Recommends bottom. 
[42:00]
 What's the address again Anthony?  Jailbabes.com.  I'm looking at Tanya who is 26.  I didn't know they had panelling in prison.  She's a black woman, baby got back.  I see that.  Single, release date unknown.  That's not a good sign.  She's caring, color blinded, sincere, sexy kitten.  She enjoys dancing. 
[42:30]
 I can tell by the tat on her ass.  They don't want her dancing in prison.  Another one who likes traveling.  Willing to relocate.  I thought I'd stay in prison after I got out.  I fixed it up nice.  With his box of weapons.  Prisoners made in jail.  Prison weapons, shanks.  I'm down with this.  You don't want to be shanked in there. 
[43:00]
 Homemade tattoo guns.  Made out of bones.  From whatever they ate that day.  Whatever they didn't kill and still ate.  They're very industrious.  We shot those and asked for letters.  Two so far.  I don't want to give away the whole story.  One is this guy from West Virginia. 
[43:30]
 I got in here and this old timer came up to me.  How did you come here?  I told him I come in a van.  The old timer goes, I came in a horse and buggy.  The guy is 99 years old.  He got popped for robbing a train.  Probably a horseback or something.  He was on a horse on the back of a truck.  And killed somebody during the robbery.  He's been in there for 80 years. 
[44:00]
 What a rip.  We had this other guy who said he had just been transferred to...  not bisexual.  Co-gender facility.  Co-ed facility.  He was talking about the women there.  He's like, they're scary.  I met this one.  Cut him up, stuff him in mason jars.  And nail him one by one back to this guy's parents. 
[44:30]
 That's why she's in prison.  Bad canning technique.  That's a good one.  Nobody could get sick from these.  We got a lot of them with their whining and stuff.  It's like, I'm innocent.  That's something the family doesn't forget.  Getting your son mailed to you in jars.  Can you imagine someone who didn't know about this? 
[45:00]
 For Christmas, mails him jellies.  That's something you don't just wake up and not instantly go.  My son was mailed to me in jars every morning.  I've got to tell you this one.  Along those lines, wake up.  I had him stick something on the web that said  what's the weirdest thing you've ever seen when you first wake up in the morning?  We just got one the other day.  He's a med school student.  He's got about 20, 30 lab animals. 
[45:30]
 His friends got all the lab animals, hamsters, gerbils, rats and stuff  and super glued them to the walls and ceiling of his dorm room.  He wakes up in the morning and there's these live animals  glued to the walls and ceiling.  There were 30 of them.  He had to shave them off.  Why are these things shaved?  Anti-gravity experiments.  Can you imagine 30 gerbils glued to your ceiling still alive?  That's pretty funny. 
[46:00]
 1027 WNEW, the latest from Sugar Ray.  That's every morning.  It's Opie and Anthony and Mark Golden from Maxim Magazine.  Everyone is getting excited about this Jets contest we got happening here.  All you have to do is listen for the Jets chant.  That's your cue to call in.  You will qualify to see the big game Sunday.  We're going to give you a Jets prize package  just for trying with the Jets sweatshirt and other things.  Your chance to win is coming in a few minutes here. 
[46:30]
 Hi, N.E.W.  I'm over here doing a side job.  I'm painting away here.  I got the radio on because it's my best buddy.  I want to scream on the top of my lungs.  Just listen to these people.  We got another chance to win in about 15 minutes.  I just want to scream right now for you.  Jets, Jets, Jets, J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets, Jets, go! 
[47:00]
 That's the way you do it.  I'll give a call back to Danny.  Give me a little shot there.  You just did it all.  We want you to get psyched for the game.  Does anyone have any opinions on the worst dress list  that Mr. Blackwell put out?  That guy's a fag!  The inimitable words of Jeff Spicoli.  You ever see Blackwell? 
[47:30]
 Wow.  Is this what he does all year now?  He puts together this one little list.  Jerry Lewis after the telethon, he goes,  It goes all year.  I start the day after the telethon to work it up.  Let's get to work, people. Our job is not done.  We break down, we set up again.  Wow, look at what it is.  It's time to get to work on the 2000 worst dress list. 
[48:00]
 They did.  Linda Tripp is the worst dressed of the past year.  Do you know what she looks like in this picture?  Remember Total Recall?  When Arnold Schwarzenegger had to get to Mars  and he had to dress up in that mechanical get up of that woman,  the big fat woman, and they asked him,  Where are your papers? He's like, Excuse me?  And the mouse started going crazy. 
[48:30]
 That's what Linda Tripp looks like at a press conference.  She looks better when photographed against panelling.  They photographed her great.  She's walking straight on with just hips like a Clydesdale.  She's got this big silver belt buckle accentuating that huge area  that is her gut.  We always used to call that a map truck with the doors open.  I think she's kind of cute. 
[49:00]
 Oh yeah.  She's adorable.  Mark, Anthony thinks Linda Tripp looks like the Seahawk from Popeye's.  It's the Seahawk.  Makes me member shrinks.  And what's with that big belly?  I bet it covers her pussy.  Well, blow me down.  I bet it covers her pussy.  I bet it covers her pussy. 
[49:30]
 Well, blow me down.  You can't say pussy on the radio.  We've been through this already, Popeye.  I don't even know what that means.  No? Pusky.  But I bet it covers her pussy.  I could have gone to med school.  I could have been a urologist right now.  Where did things go awry?  I'm not going to do any pesky jokes. 
[50:00]
 Who else is on this list? Madonna?  Yeah, she makes it every year.  Blackwell's an idiot.  What's Madonna supposed to do?  Dress up with the Mindy stuff and the getup every time she walks out?  She walks out of the house wearing a t-shirt and some pants  to go maybe get her little kids something.  And Blackwell's people are there, snap a picture.  Then I'm wrong.  And Courtney Love gets the worst dress? 
[50:30]
 Oh, wait, you skipped over Kate Winslet from Titanic.  Well, she always looks like she's wearing her underwear.  Yeah, but she had the best boobs of 1998.  And they've only gotten bigger with the rest of her.  Yeah, Courtney Love's on there.  I don't understand that.  At least give her some kind of improvement.  She doesn't have it all figured out yet.  But Blackwell, I don't know.  And who is he to judge how good a woman looks? 
[51:00]
 I mean, really.  I look at Courtney Love in this picture and go,  she looks good.  I don't know what he looks like actually.  I always picture him as a goatee.  Really? Like a goatee with one of those French berets on?  Very feminine.  Like one of those pointy Van Dykes?  If you were in Armenia, maybe women would have goatees like this.  Alright, so congratulations to Linda Tripp. 
[51:30]
 Linda Tripp, looking good.  The Seahag, worst dressed of 1998.  Wait, who is best dressed?  Does he have that?  No, he doesn't care.  He likes that whole look.  The pillbox hat thing.  She's a classy woman.  Isn't that classy?  She's got it all together. 
[52:00]
 Dress up a woman so no man can ever be attracted to her.  And that's what he thinks looks good.  Oh my God, did you see the version Mary with the cow?  Mother Teresa, that's a look.  You go into some guy's apartment and you see Judy Garland on the wall.  Or Marilyn Monroe, you knew he was gay, right?  Hillary Clinton.  She's such a strong woman.  She would understand me.  1027WNAW, the rockin' New York talking heads, life during wartime, before that ever last doing what it's like. 
[52:30]
 It's Opien Anthony and it's Mark Golan from Max of Magazine.  And we'll be right back.  The editor in chief of Max of Magazine has cute little pictures in every issue.  Editor in chief.  It sounds like he's Mr. White from the Superman thing.  Editor in chief.  Great Caesar's ghost. 
[53:00]
 Get in here, Kent.  You call this a photo?  Get me one of Spiderman.  I'm Jameson.  Parker, you're fired!  We've talked about Superman on this show many times.  I used to think when your boss fired you, it was like that.  When I was a kid, just from what I saw on TV shows, I always thought if you got fired, you went in and the boss went,  You're fired!  You've got to get to like back and forth. 
[53:30]
 You're fired!  And they also have to flick a cigar ash on your nose.  And then they have a button they push.  And the trap door opens.  And you're fired!  We're going to have to let you go.  There's been a layoff.  We're downsizing.  You guys got fired.  We were terminated. 
[54:00]
 This is a true story.  We were terminated.  There was a guy coming in with an Uzi.  Up in Boston, our last radio gig, we got terminated.  It was a week long big investigation on whether we said the mayor was dead or not.  Everyone knew that we said it.  I would imagine it was pretty public.  But they didn't know what to do about it.  So they had this big internal investigation to see if we would roll over on anyone else so they could fire them too.  Under the guise of, open up and maybe you'll get fired. 
[54:30]
 So this guy comes in.  What's his name?  Don Belukas?  Who now works for the CBS organization.  We're one big happy family!  Right, Donnie, boy?  And he comes into this conference room in a hotel.  With a hundred foot long conference table.  With this little weasel lawyer guy who is shaking and sweating.  Did the lawyer guy giggle? 
[55:00]
 No, he was like, come on, tell him boss!  He sits us down and Belukas goes, um, we're going to have to terminate your contracts.  I was like, wow!  And then Opie gets ready to say something and I'm like, what's he going to do?  I go, wait, you're going to tell him something and he's going to go, you know?  You're right!  I'm going to get on the horn to the boss and tell him your side!  All of a sudden streamers start falling.  It would have been like Sarah Connor going up to the terminator and going, no, but it's okay! 
[55:30]
 I'll tell my son not to do that in the future.  No, he's the terminator! His job is to kill you!  You don't reason with him!  Did he actually take out your contracts and shoot them?  No, he held it up and it burst into flames as he left.  We're convinced this guy had no heart.  I didn't think I was leaving the conference room.  I thought it was going to be like the scene in Goodfellas where Pesci gets it.  Hey, what happened? 
[56:00]
 Hey, I'm going to be made!  But we were terminated. It was fun.  Then we go to a bar. This is the funniest thing.  We were the last people to know we were fired.  We go to a bar because that's what you do.  You're fired!  And we're at the bar less than five minutes after we were terminated because you don't stick around for a small party.  No, no.  Small time.  So we were terminated.  How's the wife and kids?  So we're in the bar, up on the TV.  VJ's fired for their stunts. 
[56:30]
 We're at the bar looking at him.  But we just found out.  Now the key thing here is, did you get a free drink?  Yes, we did.  Did you?  Many free drinks.  Yeah, the girl at the bar was very nice.  They were really bummed.  And then they escorted us to the Connecticut border.  Yeah.  Leave!  Connecticut, that's vicious.  If you know anything about Boston's Mayor Menino, he went,  There's the lady, there's the lady.  The worst speech impediment.  We used to goof on him relentlessly. 
[57:00]
 And he finally got the best of us.  Now we have Giuliani.  So we're happy.  Yep.  All right.  Well, I was going to talk about the baseball.  Do we have time?  No, I don't like seeing memories or something now.  Yeah, I'm getting all choked up.  I'm misty.  I'm freaking misty here.  Yeah, cute story.  I didn't even know you back then.  Don't you feel for us now?  Yeah, I'm nostalgic.  The best part though, I want to open my mouth and argue our case.  It's like, you don't argue your case with this guy. 
[57:30]
 He's a Terminator.  We affected the stock of this company.  It was that bad.  All of a sudden the stock went down because we held up this billion dollar merger between  American radio systems and CVS.  It was like these two idiots on the radio.  Million dollar merger held up.  People jumping off of roofs losing millions.  Oh, what?  If you can't win a Nobel Prize, go the other way and screw everybody's lives off.  Just totally screwed it up. 
[58:00]
 And I'm sitting there like, what?  I thought we were all just having fun.  What happened?  OP calls me that morning.  It's like April Fool's morning.  Anthony?  Yeah?  What's up, O?  I've got an idea.  April Fool's.  April Fool's, are you?  Okay, it's good.  What do you got?  What do you got?  We go in the air and say the mayor was killed in a horrific fiery car crash in Florida.  Oh yeah, it's hysterical.  All right, I'll see you later, man. 
[58:30]
 And from such humble beginnings.  Yeah.  You think back, if I just would have said, were you crazy?  He just got up an hour earlier and had coffee.  Yeah, that would have been better.  The fate of a nation.  But hey, look how it worked out.  All right?  It worked out perfectly for us.  We're in New York.  We're home.  We're back home.  That was scary though.  Reporters chasing us all over the highways. 
[59:00]
 Welcome home.  Yeah, that was good.  That was great.  We're just goofing and stuff and it really started getting bad.  And a reporter for ABC comes out of the lunchroom at the radio station as we were leaving.  The mayor, I am very upset about your words.  What do you have in response to say?  And now we're at the apologetic point.  So picture me looking at the camera going, well, I just want to say I'm sorry.  I'm all laughing.  It's so insincere. 
[59:30]
 It made it 20 times worse.  There was no way out of it.  And he leaves and I'm told, was that good?  You think I was good?  And of course, the mayor's dead t-shirt you were wearing didn't help matters at all.  Oh, it's ugly, man.  He had to hold a press conference this short.  He was alive.  I'd like to say that I am still breathing.  Perfect timing.  The consequences of which could only be akin to winning the Irish sweepstakes happened. 
[60:00]
 Where when we said this, he was on a plane so no one could get in touch with him at the time.  So, hey, the mayor's dead.  What?  Mayor's dead?  Oh my God.  Going to emergency mode.  There were DEF CON 5 in town hall.  Al Haig showed up.  Al Haig was in charge.  I'm in charge.  I'm the mayor now.  We're just two bumbling idiots screwed stuff up so bad from a dopey joke.  So what's going to happen to you guys? 
[60:30]
 Oh my God, this is just in Juliani Den.  Don't even go there.  I wonder who's on a plane right now.  From the neck up.  We've been told at N.E.W. that we get April Fool's off.  Yeah, we get it off.  So, alright.  We'll talk about the front page of the news next.  Oh, nostalgic there.  I didn't really want to bring that up ever again, Ann.  It was like therapy.  It was good.  We needed to get that out, I guess.  We got to call that Don Balukis guy.  We're all for the same company now. 
[61:00]
 Get his number.  We'll call him up and say, I think it's big hug time.  Yeah, sure it is.  We'll go on that show with the big black woman.  What is that?  Where you apologize to each other?  They have that show?  You apologize to a big black woman?  Well, she negotiates the whole thing.  She's the broker.  It's this show, yeah.  Mother love or...  Yeah, and you go on and it's forgive and forget or something like that.  Or forgive or forget.  We'll do that.  I'm sure that'll work.  That'll work.  All right.  1027W, N.A.W., the Rock of New York with the latest from Collective Soul. 
[61:30]
 That's run off the Dosage CD.  It's Opie and Anthony and Mark Golan from Maxim Magazine.  I think we need to get a jet qualifier here, Anthony.  We have the Jet's chant there.  We got a Jet's prize package and a chance for you to go to Denver for the game Sunday.  I want a screamer.  Someone's got to yell.  All right?  Well, let's see.  Plunk the phone down.  Get somebody that can... with some lungs.  Hi, N.A.W.  Hello.  Hi, who's this? 
[62:00]
 Mike Rozak.  All right.  He sounds good.  You sound psyched.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Clifton, New Jersey.  Are you psyched for the game Sunday?  Oh, you better believe it.  What do you think our chances are?  I think we are going to win.  It's going to be a tough game, but the Chess are definitely going to beat Denver.  What are the chances Elway loses his teeth?  No, I'm hoping.  All right.  Those huge teeth.  I hope he did not get more out of his head.  You know what?  They would look like the little lines in between the... on the field.  That's a good one.  And also, it gets knocked out of his mouth and it would go, wait a minute. 
[62:30]
 Those are the hash marks.  There's a couple more hash marks on the field.  All right.  We need the Jets chant as loud as you could do it.  Okay, not a problem.  Now we've got Mark Goleman from Action Magazine.  He is the judge, so you've got to impress him.  All right.  You already have won the Jets prize packages.  All right.  Cool.  Okay, go ahead.  Ready?  Hit it.  All right.  Mark, what do you think?  Not bad.  The idea qualifies for...  Do you need another stab at it?  I'm happy with it.  Yeah, I want to hear tonsils flying across the room and splatting into the wall.  I'll give it my all again.  And I want to know there's a good 50 feet between you and the wall. 
[63:00]
 Yeah, we want to hear that you're turning red.  Okay.  You ready?  Hit it.  J-E-S-Jets chant.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Now that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There we go.  You're qualified for the trip.  You're qualified.  Hold on the line, all right?  I hope I get there.  Hold on the line. 
[63:30]
 No problem.  Line five.  Very cool.  All right.  Front page of the Daily News.  What do you guys think about the McGuire ball going for $2.7 million?  It's ridiculous.  I'd pay for Elway's teeth like $2.7 million.  Well, Anthony and I said yesterday I'd pay for Mickey Mantle's liver.  Mickey Mantle's liver.  I'm the babe.  I have a baby boy.  I have a baby boy for the children.  You ever see that tape?  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape. 
[64:00]
 I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  I've never seen that tape.  to theром áreaifall Wrong mama duck panel  Brad Jian 
[64:30]
 pointed out the right field ran out there and died.  That's horrible.  That's a little harsh.  Wow.  He put his larynx up onto the bleachers.  He nailed it to the side of the stadium.  Man, that's hard.  He painted his number on it.  God, that's nasty.  Or Holyfield's ear.  Yeah, that disappeared from the canvas.  Where did that go? 
[65:00]
 Where did that go?  You know someone has it and he's bragging and probably getting laid because he hasn't.  Well, you know, there's a big collector's mark.  I was just reading about this guy.  He's like a doctor.  I mean, he's 75, 80 years old.  He's got this collection of all these, like, you know, some bloody pillow that Abraham  Lincoln was laid down on when he died.  Oh, yeah.  He has the largest Kennedy murder memorabilia collection.  I mean, he's just got like hundreds of pieces with pieces of Kennedy.  Really?  Wow. 
[65:30]
 I mean, like, the seat covers from the car, you know, the fuzzy dice.  Ah, jeez.  I don't remember seeing fuzzy dice in the Zapruder film.  Wait, another conspiracy.  Who stole the fuzzy dice?  You see it from a different catamaran.  You don't see it dangling there.  But yeah, and his big fear is when he dies, the collection will be broken up.  They'll be split up.  Well, that's why I lose sleep.  I'll tell you.  I just think that collection will be cool.  Who cares? 
[66:00]
 Now, Mark, you got a letter about Jenny McCarthy's breast implant.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  One of our...  Is this going to make a future issue of Maxim Magazine?  It may.  I mean, depending on how successful he can be, because he wrote in and he was saying he'd  heard that Jenny McCarthy's going to have her breasts, her fake breasts, her implants  removed.  And he wanted to know, like, could he write a story?  Could he, like, go try and buy them?  Like, maybe they'll come up for auction online or...  Or at www.fakebate.com.  And our next lot... 
[66:30]
 Up for bid.  We only have two of these.  It's up there.  Of those guys on the shopping channel.  These are great.  Have you ever seen implants like this?  Ladies and gentlemen, do not make me break this up.  There are only two.  Here is the low price.  We're looking at implants that will gain value in the hundreds of dollars over the next couple  of weeks.  Sign.  Did I mention sign?  Limited edition one and two.  Ever so some guy gets so excited over baseball cards.  Hey, Mark McGuire, rookie card. 
[67:00]
 Oh, Sammy, sold a rookie card.  Balls in his back.  Oh, my God.  I'm hemorrhaging.  Oh, my God.  Look at the quality of this cellophane.  So, yeah, so he's going to try and buy them.  And he was like, talkie.  The letter went on.  He was, like, talking about, look, you know, like, I'll keep them in my house on the mantle.  And when friends come over and are watching a Super Bowl and stuff, we're, okay, who makes  the next touchdown?  Whoever wins gets to hold Jenny McCarthy's breasts for five minutes.  Here you go.  Yeah, there you go.  So he's really trying for that.  Yeah. 
[67:30]
 You know, Jewish people have, like, a mizuzo on the door.  You can just, like, nail her, like, breasts onto, like, the door of your house.  Just touch him as you leave and touch him as you come back in.  Ms. Bubba.  Ms. Bubby.  Would make a nice paperweight at work.  Yeah.  Conversation piece.  Keep them with you when you're in the desert and there's no water.  You're messed up.  I want to talk to your dealer.  The Rock of New York, 1027W, I.W.  I won't say anything corny. 
[68:00]
 Like, that one goes out to the Jets.  But I say it goes out to the Broncos.  What?  That's Freddie Mercury and John Elway have the same dentist.  You have a sick thought on Freddie Mercury.  Mark would appreciate that one.  Well, after everybody found out his sexual preference after a few years, the only thing  I can think of now when I see him is who was on the receiving end of those choppers. 
[68:30]
 I'm sorry.  It just comes to mind.  You know.  Tell it like it is.  How it is.  They are a pep rally for Friday.  It looks like it's coming together.  It's actually coming together.  No, wait.  What is this?  It's not a definite, but it looks like it's coming together.  The Jets have been working their butt off.  We want to have a big bash with a bunch of Jets fans on Friday.  We're going to get a Bronco.  We're going to give them all sledgehammers.  Sledgehammers and just pummel this thing. 
[69:00]
 Just beat the crap out of it.  After they're done with the Bronco, we get to go home.  We burn it.  Yeah, we'll burn it.  Roll it over.  Yeah.  And then the books.  We'll burn the books too.  People.  People, yeah.  Smart people.  Just smart people.  People with their own ideas.  Yeah, people that think things.  Might undermine our organization.  Oh, but first we're just going to hit the Bronco.  Yeah.  Sledgehammers.  It'll be fun. 
[69:30]
 Yeah.  So keep listening for details.  I think we'll pull this off.  Somewhere around Giant Stadium I think we're going.  Sports bar down there.  What?  I'm looking in the paper.  Did you know a toy that was in demand this Christmas.  I read about this.  Is now on like the CIA's hit list.  Who knew the lovable cuddly Furby was so dangerous to national security.  Now why is it dangerous?  Well, the National Security Agency has banned Furbies from its offices.  For fear the chatterbox computer toys will gather and repeat national secrets. 
[70:00]
 First of all, how many of these were in the offices in the giveaway?  Yeah, to begin with.  That worries me.  Nuclear weapons around.  Yeah.  And they're hanging out with Furby dogs.  There's Furbies.  Where'd I leave the briefcase?  Furby on the desk.  Do it.  Do it.  Push the button.  Do it.  I love you.  What's this cue?  It's a Furby, James.  Spits fire out of its eyeballs, James.  Very dangerous.  But yeah, they're a little upset because it does talk after a while. 
[70:30]
 You might just hear this when you first get it.  Which is funny because that's all the Russian secrets that we were learning.  But then after a while it learns English.  It starts repeating you.  Find its way out to the woods.  Out to the woods to make a drop of its pictures.  We had these pictures taken, these telephoto pictures of a Furby outside the Kremlin. 
[71:00]
 A big Furby with one of those big tall fur hats on.  The plutonium is in transit.  I see the RCBM.  Health agents.  Very dangerous though.  They consider it a recording device.  And they don't allow any cameras or camcorders.  Sort of like a concert.  Yeah, they probably won't let them into concerts.  I bootlegged the show on a Furby, man. 
[71:30]
 These guys are holding this thing up to make daggers.  Oh wow.  You're getting frisked in the game.  No Furbies, no open containers.  No Switch plays.  Keep your Furbies at home, people.  I guess we've got to wrap up this mess.  Yeah, look at the time.  Where does time go when you come in?  It's always so much fun. 
[72:00]
 I steal it. They take it home. I'm hoarding it.  Mark Golland from Maxim Magazine.  We didn't even talk about the magazine once again.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  That happens every time.  Here, wait. Let me just hold it up to the mic.  There you go, people. Pick this up.  Maxim Magazine on your dude stand.  Maxim Magazine.  Trying to be copied by many people.  Larry Flynn.  You know what? We're actually going to out Larry Flynn.  I think he's probably had a couple of fairs.  Stop it.  No, I'm sorry.  You could get in trouble.  We're going to dig.  We are going to dig. 
[72:30]
 Dirt will be flung.  I'm going to get very upset with you if you sell that much.  Larry Wills Flynn.  Come on, man. I'll take him on.  I could kick his ass.  I could kick his butt.  Call me Uncle Flynn, you boy.  I'd have to turn him over, but I could kick his butt.  Christ.  And on that delightful thought.  Yeah, we'll get out of this train wreck, run up the stairs.  Hey, Larry.  All right, Mark. 
[73:00]
 Thanks for coming by and getting us in trouble again.  It's always a pleasure.  My pleasure.  And when is the next issue going to be out?  Well, this one's Jan Feb, which means sometime next year.  Now, the marches will probably be out like mid-February.  Anything you could tease about the issue?  Yeah.  You get us excited?  The march that I'm real excited about.  That's right.  You know, we just got, you know, we still go to the lost and found of a big transit thing, like the subway.  Right.  Claim all the false teeth and like fake limbs and take them to like a local pool or like public fountains. 
[73:30]
 That's cute.  You won't be bored.  Do you want to put these jet songs aside because we're going to need them like tomorrow?  Well, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, give me that new one.  You want the new one?  Yeah.  Why do you want the YMCA one?  Well, give me the new one first.  I've got a real special place. 
[74:00]
 Now, you're not going to do anything to this song, are you?  Why would I do anything?  It's wonderful.  I just want to put it somewhere safe where nothing will happen to it.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Can I trust you?  You can trust me this time.  All right.  Here you go.  Because we know the other guy, every time we break, it sends us a new copy.  Every day like clockwork, we have a new YMCA song.  But this guy didn't even send a name or address.  So this could be the only copy we ever, ever have.  Yeah.  So you better put it aside. 
[74:30]
 So let me really take care of this one.  Okay.  I'm just going to put it somewhere safe.  1027WNW, the rock of New York, Jerry Harrison.  Rev it up from casual gods and psycho killer before that.  Let's check in with them.  Last night, they've been online.  People from all over the country, people from Florida, somebody from LA was here, California.  It's just insane.  And they're inside now. 
[75:00]
 They're all set up, signing autographs.  You buy a CD, you get a ticket until they run out.  Okay.  That's the story.  We'll see you at the show tonight.  Absolutely.  All right, man.  Can't wait for tonight.  Rave reviews last night at the Bowery Ballroom, Plain Irving Plaza tonight.  Rock on.  Got my tickets right here.  I see you.  Haven't been to a show in a while in this town.  Yeah, look at you.  Last show we went to is Melonhead.  Yeah.  Went there.  Johnny, Johnny Cougar.  I went to Metallica.  Ah.  How was the Metallica show?  God damn, they kick ass. 
[75:30]
 Those guys just kick ass.  One of my faves.  Yep.  Man, definitely.  All right.  We were checking out their latest CD, Metallica.  Yep.  They do a version of Tuesday's Gone that is really pretty cool.  Yeah, good.  They did a good job.  The Rock in New York, 1027W, NW2 for Tuesday, Def Leppard, Rocket and Armageddon in it.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Got some R.E.M.  How are you feeling over there?  Oh, I just felt like I was on that sneezing verge. 
[76:00]
 You ever get that?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like right there and it goes away.  Anthony's been a little under the weather the last two days.  Maybe you can tell.  Maybe you can tell at home.  Can you tell?  I don't think I've come out with one wacky, zanorific thing in two days.  I'm sorry.  I'll be better tomorrow.  I swear to you.  You sure?  Yeah.  Have you been doing the NyQuil?  Yeah.  It just screws me up though.  That NyQuil should be outlawed.  No, shut up, man.  You never speak ill of the Quil.  The Quil.  The green liquid.  The green liquid of life.  I love NyQuil. 
[76:30]
 Little shot glass.  It's fun.  You take it and then you just ... All of a sudden you're sitting there and you're like,  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  You take it and then you just ... All of a sudden you're sitting there like, I'll be  sitting watch TV.  I'll take the NyQuil.  Sit down and like, all right, just wait and come on.  And then all of a sudden it's ... You just get this fuzzy feeling comes over you.  Like, oh.  That must be like one one thousandth of the heroin high, you know? 
[77:00]
 You know like when the junkies talk about you put the needle in and like, man, then  all of a sudden you just get this feeling.  This warm feeling all over.  The Quill feeling is like a little piece of that I guess, you know?  You just all of a sudden, well, hey, there it is.  It just hit me.  I think your nose just clears up.  You don't care about anything.  Do you get a good sleep on the Quill?  Yeah, I pass right out.  I get funky dreams.  Well, that's ... My mind is like racist when I'm on that stuff. 
[77:30]
 I dream every night.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I sleep well during it.  Do you see something on the paper the other day?  I think it was in Dr. ... What's that shrink that does the paper column?  Joyce Brothers.  Dr. Joyce?  Yeah.  And she had some girl saying that some guy that she knows had a dream that he was having  sex with a girl.  And he feels bad now because he feels it's cheating.  Oh, shut up. 
[78:00]
 There's so much guilt in our society.  Shut up and enjoy it.  I picture this guy just this young ... It has to be like 16 years old, probably his  first girlfriend.  He feels really bad.  You are going to enjoy those dreams when you get older because it's the only way you cheat  if you're in a faithful relationship.  You all of a sudden are ... You're laying there, oh, who's this girl?  Oh, all of a sudden I'm naked with the girl I just saw in Burger King three days ago. 
[78:30]
 Wow.  This is great.  I never go to completion because my wife always walks in on me.  Even in my dreams.  Like in my dreams I'll be with a girl, ready to do something, and I'll be like, oh my God,  Jennifer's in the other room.  I can't do this.  And I don't do it.  The guilt overwhelms you.  But it's a dream.  I feel like I should know.  It's a dream.  Just go for it.  Yeah, that's the difference between you and I.  I go to completion and then I try to find the dream girl's sister. 
[79:00]
 Just go for it.  Clean the sheets and leave the house.  But I don't know what happens.  Something just a monkey wrench gets thrown in there and I just can't get it to work.  Those dreams are just great.  You can't count on them, but they're great.  Oh, when they come up, it's like great.  You're just, hey, look at this.  I didn't have to work at this at all and it's free.  It is free.  It's great.  No drinks to buy, nothing.  We are getting requests for the Hummer Time song. 
[79:30]
 We'll play it again here.  Sure, the Hummer Queen.  We're encouraging local bands or whoever to come up with songs for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  We got our first one today.  1027WNEW, the rag of New York, R.E.M. from Life's Rich Padgetts.  That's Superman and What's the Frequency, Kenneth, from the Monster CD.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Just about out the door.  Yeah, well.  Got one more twofer, I think, and then we're going to hit the road.  Twofer. 
[80:00]
 I remember talking about dreams before and cheating in your dreams.  And this guy is emailing us.  He says, I used to live with a girl in Southern California.  Whenever I had those cheat days while I was doing the deed in my dream, I was actually  thrusting and thrashing in bed.  She'd wait until I stopped and then wake me several times by Hummer and ask, what were  you dreaming of?  Yeah, I guess, you know, sometimes you...  I remember when I was younger having those dreams where you would just complete the act  and make a mess, as they say. 
[80:30]
 Jesus, Ed.  Well, when you're a kid.  All right.  I think everybody's done that.  What?  I'm just saying.  You didn't have to go the distance on that.  I think people understood when you said complete the act.  Well, sorry.  Made a mess.  Well, that's what I mean, yeah.  Did you have a sock under your bed that stood up on its own?  No, that was just the sheets.  But then you do.  hazy doubled memory of the dream and also like just thrashing around on the bed like 
[81:00]
 that.  Yeah, pretty twisted.  I haven't had one in years, though.  Good kid thing.  You know why?  Because you get too much sex.  Oh, that must be it.  No, you get the wet dreams because, you know, it's built up.  It's built up.  Yeah.  That's true.  You're releasing your dreams.  I can see that.  Unless you release yourself.  But if you can hold out, the dream is great.  Yeah.  Well, you know that?  Yeah, without a doubt.  I know that.  I get any sex.  I don't.  I wait for those wet dreams. 
[81:30]
 That's like your relationship.  It's your dreams.  My relationship is going to sleep.  I gotta go to sleep.  My girlfriend.  The Rock of New York 1027WNW.  Two from the Who from Quadrophenia, Bellboy and Squeezebox.  Before that from Who by Numbers.  I'm going to be an Anthony just about out the door.  You going to bid on the McGuire home run ball tonight?  I'm going to bid like maybe ten bucks. 
[82:00]
 No, I would rather bid on Mickey Mantle's liver or something.  That would be something cool to have.  The mixed liver.  The mixed liver.  You know someone somewhere has Mickey Mantle's liver in a jar and they brag about it at parties.  Well, he did get a transplant.  They got the transplant.  You know they didn't just take his old liver out and throw it away.  Someone's got that liver and I want to know who and I want to make a bid on that.  Little vials of the mixed liver.  A little piece of it.  I think someone of the doctors or something or one of the interns that are supposed to 
[82:30]
 throw the stuff away.  Someone has.  Packed it up.  Mickey Mantle's liver.  Who is it?  It's Mantle Pate.  What would that go for?  How do you validate that?  DNA testing?  DNA testing possibly.  That's what I want.  That's what I want.  I don't want a stupid ball.  Or like the babes voice box.  Yeah.  The babes riddled voice box. 
[83:00]
 Now you're listening to this and saying you guys are sick.  I guarantee there are people that have this type of stuff in their collection and it's  a major hit at parties.  Well, didn't the Evander ear make it to market?  Did it?  Somebody underground.  Yeah.  Alright, where is the ear?  Where is the Evander ear?  Someone has the ear.  Have you seen the new Snickers commercial?  Speaking of the ear.  Is that one of the funniest commercials out there?  Yeah, the guy's got the huge ears.  But you don't know it at first and his trainer is like,  Come on, you gotta fight him. 
[83:30]
 You gotta.  And he finally uncovers his ears and he's got these huge cauliflower ears.  That is so funny. </pre>
