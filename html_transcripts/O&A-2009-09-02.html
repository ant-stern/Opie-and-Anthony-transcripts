<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a lengthy discussion of Opie’s upcoming, reluctantly accepted, fly-fishing trip with Robert Kelly.  Kelly’s meticulous planning, including securing a guide ("J.W. Trout"), a motel, and even the flies, was contrasted with Opie's anxieties about the lack of shopping for his girlfriend and the presence of Kelly's two dogs.  The segment included numerous tangents, referencing the Roscoe Diner, the perceived "gayness" of antique shop owners, and comedic comparisons to "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy."  Callers weighed in, confirming the lack of shopping and spotty cell service in Roscoe, New York, with Psycho Bob adding comedic commentary likening the trip to "The Andy Griffith Show."

The show then dramatically shifted to a scathing critique of a Larry King interview with a rape victim.  The hosts and callers expressed outrage and disbelief at King's insensitive questioning, focusing on the victim's groceries instead of her trauma.  Numerous sarcastic and offensive jokes mocked King's interviewing style.  The segment briefly returned to the fly-fishing trip before Anthony's abrupt exit due to a severe need to defecate, prompting further jokes.  Crude comments about Sharapova and other female tennis players were also made.  This segment extensively detailed crass and insensitive jokes about the rape victim’s experience, focusing on irrelevant details like the location of food in her car and the rapist’s actions.  The poor execution of the interview and the interviewer’s inappropriate questions were also heavily mocked.

Following this, the discussion turned to the death of Diane Shuler, the controversy surrounding her intoxication at the time of a fatal car accident, and the criticism of Dominic Barber for his repeated media appearances and seemingly insensitive behavior regarding the investigation and his push for an exhumation.  Listener calls continued the barrage of absurd questions related to the rape interview, including discussions about the song “Pussy Control” playing during the incident. The show then included a comparison of John Sterling's Yankee home run calls to those of Mike Lang, playing audio clips of both.  This transitioned into an extended discussion of various pornography websites, particularly "Rank My GF," with graphic descriptions of women's bodies and clothing and preferences regarding how women undress. The segment included numerous off-topic discussions about celebrity birthdays and workplace banter involving colleagues.

A substantial portion featured guest Rich Vos.  The hosts and Vos engaged in commentary on graphic images of women, using crude and offensive language and a subjective "Mother of God" rating scale. The conversation shifted to Vos's work at "Poco Nuts," his struggles with anger, his golf game with Opie, and his return to 12-step meetings.  The fly-fishing trip was revisited with further humorous exchanges and disagreements about its details and Opie’s resistance. The show concluded with a discussion of a disturbing video depicting the culling of male chicks in a chicken factory, prompting expressions of disgust and shock at the cruelty of industrial farming.

The final segment opened with a discussion about chickens and roosters, featuring Opie’s admission of ignorance about the relationship between the two.  Three voicemails from the absent Norton were played.  One described a gathering at Anthony’s house as a "cockfest," mentioning Rich Vos, Joe DeRosa, Danny, and Danny's dad.  Another detailed Norton's LA experiences preparing for the Jay Leno show, including an anecdote about his girlfriend being embarrassed by his Preparation H use.  The third voicemail described his mother's worry about him due to the California wildfires, which the hosts found absurd.  A trivia competition between Bobo and Rich Voss, moderated by Danny, followed. Questions covered US presidents (in reverse order from Obama), Hitler's birthplace, Africa's deadliest animal, the scientific name for the Northern Lights, the Million Man March leader, the first city hit by an atomic bomb, and Thomas Edison's nickname. Bobo's spelling and answers were frequently mocked, leading to laughter and insults. Bobo ultimately won 6-4. The show concluded with plugs for Rich Voss's shows and further comedic banter involving Bobo.  The entire segment was filled with vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  And we're off!  Hi.  We didn't get the pep talk from Sam today.  I know, I hope you have a good show regardless.  God, I hope we can do this.  Without the Sam pep talk.  Without the pre-game pep talk from Sam Roberts.  Sam.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, Anthony.  This hump day.  I guess I'm going fly fishing.  Are you really? Did he talk you into going?  Well, Robert Kelly was in yesterday talking about fly fishing. 
[00:00:30]  And I was stupid enough to go, you know what?  I'll try that.  I like nature. I'll give it a try.  So I'm watching...  What was I watching last night?  Some nonsense.  Fly fishing channel?  Yeah, right.  America's Got Talent?  Yeah.  I'm watching that.  Those shows.  Some mundane crap.  And I get a phone call with Robert Kelly.  And he set up the whole trip.  Did he?  I'm like, I didn't say I was going for real.  He'll rope you right into it.  Where are you going?  Well, I got the email right here. 
[00:01:00]  It's upstate somewhere.  Yeah, we're going to go to Roscoe.  Where's Roscoe?  How far is that?  Roscoe's about an hour and a half north of the city.  I passed it many, many times going back and forth to western New York.  We used to live up there.  It's the Roscoe Diner.  You've got to know the Roscoe Diner.  It's very famous.  I really don't.  Just because it's off Route 17 and everyone stops there for a little grub before they hit the city.  So I got an email last night.  The Bob and Greg fly fishing extravaganza weekend with the girls and two dogs. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, God.  Like he wants...  The girls will go, though?  He wants the girls to go and he wants them to go, like, shopping.  And it's like...  He wants to be friends with you so bad.  I know.  It's like redneck heaven up there.  He really wants to be friends with you.  And what?  We set the women loose up there while we're fly fishing in a stream somewhere?  They'll shop and you fly fish.  So my girl, she's like, fuck that.  I want to try some fly fishing.  Really? 
[00:02:00]  She'll try the fly fishing.  She doesn't want to go shopping.  I saw this episode on the honeymooners.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  See, the guys wanted to go fishing, but they didn't want to take the girls.  But then they had to.  And the girls then wanted to, you know, go fly fishing and bought all the gear and everything.  And let me guess.  Oh, you said the honeymooners?  I thought you were going to say, I'm still half asleep.  I thought it was, I love Lucy.  Oh, right, right.  Because then I was going to say, let me guess, Lucy messed up things in the end.  Well, you know, there was a Lucy episode, too, with fishing.  That's what I was thinking when you started saying that. 
[00:02:30]  And she bought all the gear also.  Yeah.  I think the honeymooners were first on that one.  All right.  Well, the Bob and Greg fly fishing extravaganza weekend with the girls and two dogs.  I can't wait to tell him that I'm allergic to dogs and he's going to have to, you know, keep those dumb dogs at home.  I'm not fucking sneezing for 12 straight hours because he needs to bring his dogs into nature to do some fly fishing.  How, like, annoying is it to keep tabs on your dogs in the woods and by a river and stuff?  I don't know.  But you got to keep tabs on them. 
[00:03:00]  And you know what?  The whole time he's talking to me last night, it's obvious that I really don't want to go.  But he's getting so excited.  He was.  He's a young boy.  And I think we've all been through this, and I'm kind of, like, trying to keep the door open so I can say no.  I'm like, oh, yeah, it sounds good, Bob.  Sounds good.  Yeah, I'm there.  Let me check to make sure I got nothing else going on that weekend, and I'll get back to you.  Well, you got to get the hotel.  I mean, they're going to sell out these hotels.  Now he booked it.  Hotel.  It's a motel, first of all.  Oh, no.  It's like a $75 night motel.  Oh, no. 
[00:03:30]  You're staying in, like, a hunter's hotel.  Oh, yeah.  And then he's got a guide.  He called up this guide.  A guide?  Who refuses to be called his real name.  We have to call him J.W. Trout.  All right.  J.W. Trout is going to be our guide for the fly fishing extravaganza weekend with the girls and two dogs.  J.W. Trout.  Yeah.  Is going to guide you.  That's his fishing name. 
[00:04:00]  And then the email has J.W. Trout's info.  And you're going with BK Douche?  Yeah, pretty much.  And then at the end of the email, it says, match the hatch.  That's his.  So we're going to be matching the hatch.  Which is your fly, I guess, has to look like a bug.  So I was just minding my own business watching some dumb mundane TV before I go to bed.  And now you're stuck going to Roscoe.  I think I'm stuck and I'm going to go fly fishing with Robert Kelly because he was so excited and how he's talking about it. 
[00:04:30]  And I kept saying, well, let me check my schedule.  I'll get back to you.  And then I hang up.  And then he calls back.  Why?  Because he's a little nervous that I'm not going to get a motel room.  I'm like, I'll get back to you.  You are so stuck doing this now.  He's like, if you don't call ahead, you're not going to get a king bed.  What do you get?  At the $75 a night motel up there.  What do you get?  Like a little twin?  You got to share with your girl? 
[00:05:00]  No, no.  We squeeze into whatever beds available.  Yeah, I mean, that's fine.  You know, as long as you're not.  Bobby will probably be like, we'll sleep together and let the girls sleep together.  Actually, when you get a hotel room and you do get the two beds because maybe the king size rooms are all taken.  Yeah.  That extra bed comes in handy.  Just throw all your crap on.  All your crap goes right on top of it.  All nice.  And then they're usually queen beds.  So there's plenty of room in there.  There's plenty of room.  If you're into your chicken stuff.  So that's the announcement.  I'm going fly fishing with Robert Kelly.  Behind the Roscoe Diner, there's a stream up there. 
[00:05:30]  I want to see this stream.  Are you Google mapping the stream in Roscoe, New York?  I mean, the whole area up there is really nice.  It's like a hunter's paradise.  Is it, though?  I mean.  We're going to look so faggy because, I mean, there's going to be real hunters up there with real rifles.  You know, dragging real shit out of the woods.  And we're going to be throwing what?  Twine into the stream hoping to get a bite?  Thin little fishing line.  And what if we don't match the hatch right? 
[00:06:00]  That's your problem.  You really got talked into this.  Yeah.  And he said he would make my fly for me.  I'm like, thank you.  That's wonderful.  He was so excited.  I wish, I wish that I recorded the phone call yesterday.  He's going to be standing there with you just going, dude, isn't this the best?  Dude, right?  Dude.  It's just, you know, you're one with nature.  Shut it.  I go, do I have to wear a jacket? 
[00:06:30]  Because, you know, it might be cold when we go.  It's probably going to be chilly.  It's upstate a little bit.  He goes, you look like a fleece guy.  Like, shut the fuck up.  I look like a fleece guy.  You're going to have a vest on.  You're going to have the waders.  And you're going to be standing in cold water trying to catch fish.  Yeah.  And someone already on Instant Feedback, you do not want to take dogs fishing.  Yeah, they're going to fuck up everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Because dogs like.  They trot through the water.  Yeah, they love playing in streams.  Yeah.  So.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  So I got all the info.  Good luck to you.  Keep up your good nature.  I guess I'm supposed to call today for the hotel.  I got to call J.W. Trout.  J.W. Trout.  Because he's going to, like, rent me all the gear.  Who is J.W. Trout?  I don't know.  Like, what's his real.  I think his website's jwtrout.com, Dan.  There it is.  There he is.  For real?  I'm looking at his picture right now.  What does J.W. look like?  He refuses to be called by his real name.  He goes by the name of J.W. Trout.  Looks a little like George W. Bush. 
[00:07:30]  What do we got on J.W. there, Danny?  Anything?  Any good info?  Nothing good so far.  Nothing good.  Nothing good could come from J.W. Trout.  Yeah.  Fly fishing equipment and guide services.  Yeah.  What is his guide services?  It says guiding services.  We offer...  He's going to take us to where the fish are biting.  Half and full day trips.  All day trips for wading or drift boats. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  You're going to do the wading, though, right?  And that's drift boating.  By the way, where do the girls shop in Roscoe, New York while we're in the fucking stream  with J.W. Trout?  Dude, there's nothing there.  There's the diner.  What, are they going to shop at the diner?  I don't know.  Get some knickknacks?  Are they going to go antiquing?  My girl doesn't go antiquing.  Yeah, yeah.  There's plenty of antiquing upstate.  That's all they do.  That's...  There's antique shops everywhere.  Which is stupid because every house is just filled with antiques.  Yeah.  They don't need any more. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  You know who had an antique shop up in Andes?  That, uh, the woman that used to play Gunny on Major Dad.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, you know that dikey woman?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I never saw the show, but as soon as you said that, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  She's that dikey woman with the glasses.  Yes.  And the dikey hair.  She, uh...  And apparently not just, you know, dikey hair and dikey glasses.  Yeah.  It's an antique shop up there.  She enjoyed a trout every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  A little trout.  She preferred tuna. 
[00:09:00]  But, uh, yeah, she, uh, she had an antique shop up there, and you'd walk through it and  see, like, okay, it's like a little toy train.  Oh, uh, 800 bucks.  Yeah, of course.  Get the fuck out of here.  Of course.  And then the homo-thexes moved in, uh, up there, and they open antique shops all over  the place.  They love their antiques?  Oh, do the gays love opening up little antique shops?  But why?  I don't know.  It's a gay thing to do.  Well, the men are fly fishing.  Yeah.  The gay men are, uh, selling antiques to the wives. 
[00:09:30]  I think they're, they're more manly than we are.  Than J.W. Trout?  Good old J.W. Trout.  He's gonna take care of us, according to Bob Kelly.  But I-  How does Bob know about J.W. Trout?  I don't know.  I don't know what Bob's life is all about.  Well, he's an addict.  Yeah.  I mean, he's got the tattoo.  It just says addict and all that.  He's one of those guys.  So when-  He finds something.  And he gets into it for about, I don't know, this one might last three months, and then  he's gonna move on to something else.  If that, if that.  He's gonna move on to something else. 
[00:10:00]  But the point of this conversation right now is the fact that I got swept away.  Yeah, you got-  I was just watching TV, and next thing you know, I gotta, I gotta talk to J.W.  Now you're gonna be in a river with J.W. Trout and Robert Kelly.  And you know what?  I think I'm gonna be miserable.  Yeah, you will be.  A lot of people say fly fishing is cool.  I, I wanna try it.  I like, I definitely like trying new things.  Yeah, but-  But I, I have a feeling after an hour I'm gonna be like, this sucks.  This just sucks.  Because I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get the handle of the whip motion, the 10 and 2, like 
[00:10:30]  Bobby was saying yesterday.  You know what?  You're exactly right.  When you go like deep sea fishing, how easy it is to put a worm on a hook and just drop  the line in the water.  But fly fishing, like you, it's gonna be all day for you just to learn how to do it.  If you got, like you might start getting the hang of it when they go, all right, we gotta  go.  Right.  Old J.W. Trout is gonna be like, all right, wrap it up.  Right.  My services here are done.  And he'll be like, I just got it.  If I don't get the hang of it immediately, I'm gonna be miserable.  For real.  But if I get the hang of it, I can see where maybe I'm into it a little bit. 
[00:11:00]  How the fuck do you get the hang of something people like don't get the hang of for years?  It's like golf.  It's like the first time you go out playing golf, you're gonna suck.  Right.  And what, you got one split second to, to yank it in?  Yeah, yeah.  After it spits out your, your hatch?  The second it, it like, boof, grabs the fucking thing, you gotta set that hook.  I'm in though.  No cell phone coverage in Roscoe?  Great.  Here we go.  No.  This is the start of some horrible movie.  Chris in Albany. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, I travel that Route 17, which is now they call it Route 86, on a regular basis, and  there's no cell phone coverage between Middletown, well, Middletown, Monticell, but then Monticell,  they call it to Binghamton.  Yeah, there's nothing.  And as far as the girls going shopping, they probably have to drive an hour north on Route  17 to Binghamton.  Yeah, there's like a mall in Binghamton.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  I think Bob wants to, I think Bob wants us to like, be like, couples friends. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know how you have like, couples friends?  Yeah, he wants the girls to get to know each other, and then you guys could go out.  It kind of sounds like the type of thing where you don't bring your girl.  Yeah, this is like a guy thing.  Why does he need his girl around if there's nowhere for them to go?  What, are they supposed to hang out in a motel while we're in a stream with J.W.  Trout?  They're supposed to drive to Oneonta.  Really?  And, hey, Chris, why did they change the name?  Route 17 has been Route 17 forever.  Because they're making an interstate. 
[00:12:30]  And in order for it to become an interstate, they're doing all kinds of road construction  there, and that way they get federal funding for that road.  Because, obviously, when you went to school up there, you traveled 17 a lot.  Oh, yeah.  Semantics.  I was going to be Route 86 all the way up to Rochester.  Okay, yeah, Route 17 was a great road.  So it's semantics just so they could get more money?  And that makes sense, because the last time I was looking for Route 17, I was lost.  So I guess I was on 17 the whole time.  Yes, it's 17, and in some places, it's already Route 86. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, okay.  There you go.  Well, thanks, Chris.  You have fun.  And the other fun thing is, as you drive by, you see everybody fishing in the streams.  Oh, great.  And that's where you're going to be waiting and fishing.  And, you know, we're not going this weekend.  We're going soon.  And it's going to, I think, I think deer...  It's getting colder by the day up there.  Yeah, and I think deer season's going to start, so that's great.  You have an arrow in your head.  Yeah, that's...  That'll be a lot of fun.  I, my ex, you know, the mother, lived up there, like in Andes. 
[00:13:30]  Well, you had some info, I imagine that's why.  Which is, yeah, pretty fucking cold.  And also cell phone coverage.  That's why I wound up getting my satellite phone.  Right.  Because you can't talk to anybody.  You're stranded.  You're amongst no one and nothing.  So now I've got to get a satellite phone?  Yeah, you've got to get a satellite phone.  I mean, I've been upstate a few times, and a friend of mine has a place in Downsville,  which is not too far away from Roscoe.  Yeah.  And I noticed that...  Is that where the syndrome goes? 
[00:14:00]  There is.  Well, believe me, I've seen some of the people that live there.  I know, that's exactly it.  I've noticed that if you stay close to a service station, you can get cell coverage.  Because apparently, I guess that's where they have a small repeater or something.  So if you stay close to the road, you might be able to get cell phone coverage.  Hey, that's good advice right there.  I like that.  Pull up your desk station.  Well, let's say hi to Psycho Bob.  Psycho Bob.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Opie, you're going to look just like the beginning of the Andy Griffith show. 
[00:14:30]  You and Bob Kelly walking along.  Oh, my God.  With little Opie carrying his fishing pole.  Dude!  Yes.  With Bob Kelly and Greg Hughes as Opie.  Yeah, well, since I was 12.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Now you got to throw a rock in the water and then run to catch up with Bob. 
[00:15:00]  I don't want to insult the fly fisherman out there.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  But I don't know if I'm going to be.  I don't know.  You're going to be like if there's another fly fisherman up there, you're going to be  the one they look at and laugh.  You got to be.  I'll just start wandering around in the woods.  Bobby's going to be so disappointed.  There's the opening of the Andy Griffith show.  The Andy Griffith show, the opening.  And there's Bob Kelly and the young little Ron Howard, Ronnie Howard.  Oh, they called him Ronnie Howard. 
[00:15:30]  There's little Ronnie Howard.  Ronnie, stop throwing fucking rocks in the water.  You're going to scare the fish away.  Sponsored by Post Corn Flakes.  And all the Post products.  Let me say hi to David in New York.  David.  Hi, what's up, fellas?  Hello, David.  Hey, I deliver beer, Roscoe.  I'm heading up there now.  First of all, it's the Trout capital of the United States.  They have a sign that says so.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's why J.W. Trout lives up there. 
[00:16:00]  Where else would he live?  And also, I have AT&T, which is garbage, and I have a cell phone signal up there.  I am?  I mean, there's some dead spots on the way up.  Yeah.  But you should be fine.  And about shopping and shit like that, good luck.  There's a few cool bars, but here's what's going to happen.  Yeah, great.  Both your chicks are going to be in a bar with a bunch of these fucking degenerate fishermen  guys.  With a bunch of townies.  Yeah, trying to pick them up while Bob and you are fucking commuting with nature. 
[00:16:30]  I like townies as long as they're not drinking with my woman.  Yeah, exactly.  Townies are cool until they're with your woman.  I mean, not for nothing, but imagine you're one of these locals in Roscoe, New York, and  you walk into a bar, and then Ovi's wife is sitting here.  Yeah, I know.  You're going to be like, what the fuck?  Where'd this one come from?  You better get one of those child locator things and just keep that in her purse or something.  No kidding, man.  I believe she has all her teeth.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  You know what? 
[00:17:00]  From now on, I want to be called JW Radio.  Wow.  My new name is JW Radio.  JW Radio.  God, that's great.  What name do you want?  I can't think of one.  You said JW, though.  Oh.  I mean, you like guns.  Yeah, yeah.  You like Obama.  Let's see.  No, I do.  What?  I was just checking to see if you were listening today.  I want to be JW Ammo.  JW Ammo.  I'm JW Ammo.  That's pretty pompous to change your name to JW Trout. 
[00:17:30]  Trout.  You better know where the fucking Trout are.  Unless he didn't change his name, and it's just a wild coincidence.  Can you imagine?  Mike in Roscoe.  Mike.  Oh, he's right there.  Hello, Mike.  Hey.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Do you know JW Trout to begin with?  No.  You know, actually, I've been up here five years.  I moved off of Long Island.  Hey, Anthony, I lived in Babylon right next to you where you grew up.  I'm not sure.  I was on North Shore.  I've been up here five years.  You know, I never heard of JW Trout.  He could be here. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  Oh, he's there.  Hey, LP.  Yeah.  LP.  You know how to whistle that song from Deliverance?  Yeah, I figured as much.  No, I'm only kidding.  I figured as much.  Yeah, it's one of those.  It's great up here.  I'm calling you on the phone.  I left Roscoe.  I tried to call.  I got service up here.  I got some friends, but I got service.  Oh, would I love to see Bob Kelly fucking on his.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Bob Kelly on his knees just getting fucked and making pig noises while OB's got to grab  a bow and arrow and start shooting the fucking rapist hillbillies. 
[00:18:30]  Can you imagine it just turned into some horror movie?  You got a pretty mouth in your mind for that.  Stop it, dude.  Oh, my God.  There's a few stores up there.  At that point, you know, I'm just going to talk through him like he did me, okay?  I'm just going to do this because, like, everything I was saying, he just talked over me.  And you had some good stuff.  Yeah, well, you know, trying to make a deliverance, funny bit.  You know, you got a pretty mouth, and then Bob Kelly talking about it, but all right,  sir.  Yes, sir.  Mike. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Oh, my God.  See how lonely it is up there in Roscoe?  I liked driving through Roscoe.  I liked seeing all the deer on the hoods of the cars.  Oh, I thought you were going to say on the sides of the road.  No, man.  All just shot on the hoods of the cars, right?  Tied to a fender.  The old 17, which is now 86, that was a great road to drive during deer season because  when you were bored of driving, you would just start counting dead deer. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, on the hoods and the roofs.  Yeah, fenders, the roofs of all the blood running down the back.  Oh, yeah.  It would be a brand-new Honda with a deer on the roof.  Yeah.  And you would just count them on the way back to Long Island.  Plenty of cell phone coverage.  It's near Bethel Woods.  Let me say hi to Dan in Florida.  Dan.  There it is.  Is that the actual stream?  Yeah, it's one of them.  Hold on, Dan.  Hold on, Dan.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  We're looking at a picture of the stream. 
[00:20:00]  That JW is going to take us to for some fly fishing.  I'll tell you, that looks exciting.  It doesn't even look like nature.  That could be a video, by the way.  It's a still picture, but it might as well be a video because that's how exciting it's  going to be.  You're just going to stand there, stand still, and let your line out.  I enjoy a stream when I'm hiking, but I think I'd rather hunt.  I'm not a big hunter.  Actually, I don't hunt.  I'm going to be better than that.  I'm not a hunter. 
[00:20:30]  Dan, what do you got?  Yeah.  If you've never gone fly fishing before, it's probably a good idea to get a pole and practice  out in the yard or something because it's hard.  The first time I ever went, me and my boss, we split up on the field on the streams and  they didn't want me casting over them.  And I spent the first probably 45 minutes working on a knot.  Oh, great.  Yeah, your line.  No.  This guy's right.  Your line's going to get all tangled.  I'm going to have to bring Kenny to untangle my knots. 
[00:21:00]  It's so hard to get a knot out once it gets really good.  I mean, you don't even know it's knotted at first.  Untangle your line, GH?  Yeah, fuck that.  JW Radio, untangle your line?  Can I bring Kenny?  Can you bring something?  It is.  It's a nightmare.  All right.  It's definitely something you don't want to pay to learn how to do.  See, he's saying you should be on regular land.  You could be in your yard somewhere. 
[00:21:30]  No, you can stay in your yard.  You can stay in your backyard and just practice casting because that's what you're going to  do.  The first time you go, that's what you're going to do.  You're just going to learn how to cast.  A lot of people...  If you don't mind it, I do it.  You might as well just practice.  All right.  A lot of people are saying, yeah, practice.  I'm not practicing before that.  What is it called again?  The Bobby...  Hold on.  What is it called?  Oh, no.  I can't believe I got talked into this.  I can't either.  I went from, yeah, sounds good, Bobby.  I'll get back to you.  To, holy crap, I got to get a motel room today.  You're getting up.  And I don't want to go. 
[00:22:00]  A motel room.  And you know it's just going to be like...  Get a picture of the motel room.  I'm sure there's probably a picture of the Roscoe Motel.  Yeah.  It's called roscomotel.com.  Of course.  I just said Roscoe Motel.  It's the Bob and Greg fly fishing extravaganza weekend with the girls and two dogs where we  match the hatch.  And he writes, baby.  Match the hatch, baby.  Baby.  Oh, that looks nice.  Looks very rustic.  He was excited because he said $75 a night, continental breakfast, and free HBO. 
[00:22:30]  HBO.  When they got to sell the HBO in this day and age, I'll lick the air conditioner in the  wall.  They got your...  The wall unit.  They got your new name.  I'm now JW Radio, and Josh has your name.  Josh and DC.  Who am I?  Josh.  Good morning, boys.  All right.  This is a callback from yesterday's conversation.  Anthony, you can be JW likes young girls.  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, but all right, I'll take it.  JW pedophile.  How about that?  JW teen fucker. 
[00:23:00]  JW pedophile.  Pedo.  Pedo.  I'll be sure it's pedo.  Yeah.  I'm losing my insides right now.  I'm going to crap myself.  What happened?  I really am.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I got to shit.  For real?  Oh, my God.  For real.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  What the fuck's going on?  I'm bent over.  I really got to shit.  Are you going to shit in your pants?  Oh, my God.  I can call you from the bathroom.  Call my phone.  I'm here. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  He just walked out of here like he's 80 years old.  Bent completely over.  Holding his stomach.  Holding his stomach.  And I think he shit himself, but he's not.  Like, if I shit my pants or Jimmy shit his pants, we would admit it.  Anthony would never admit if he actually shit his pants just now.  Over the break, I went to Austin, you know, Ziggy.  Fuck.  How cool is Austin?  Austin's really cool.  And we went to this town, and this is a little small town, and, like, there's, like, the world's 
[00:24:00]  oldest music hall is there.  I think it's called, like, Gruen or something like that.  Yeah.  And there's this really huge antique store.  I know you guys were just talking about antiques, but it was actually really cool.  Right.  They didn't have, like, bullshit furniture.  Like, it was a really cool store.  And we had just had dinner at, like, the neighboring place.  Like, it just had, like, chicken fried steak and all sorts of crap.  I almost, I came very dangerously close to shitting my pants in this antique store.  Really?  Oh, dude, it was terrible.  I had to run.  Just because of the food?  Um.  It had to be some beers, too, right?  Well, yeah.  I mean, you know, it's vacation. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  And, uh.  What the fuck did Anthony eat?  I don't know.  I don't know.  And I had to run, and I actually had to take a shit in this, like, outhouse kind of thing.  Yeah.  And, uh, my favorite part was, as I'm shitting, everybody that's coming into this, like, outhouse  thing, because it was, like, bigger than, like, a one-person outhouse.  Yeah.  Everybody had a comment on how the outhouse smelled.  Like, this is some kind of big surprise that a place where people take shits all day smelled  like shit.  Jesus.  You should have taken pictures of that.  But at least I made it. 
[00:25:00]  That's something you'd tweet.  Anthony.  Wow.  What the fuck happened?  That was volcanic.  Oh, please.  Jesus.  You've already released?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Get a picture.  Believe me, it was on the verge of coming out.  I had to bend over.  Well, I think your new name is J.W. Poopy Pants.  No.  Oh, what is it?  J.W. Poopy Pants.  Holy mackerel.  What the fuck did you eat last night? 
[00:25:30]  I had chicken, um, chicken with mushrooms and some type of gravy.  And just the gravy part seemed to be coming out.  Did you shit yourself in here?  No, no.  Oh, my God, though.  I couldn't even stand up straight.  Yeah, I know.  You walked out like you were 85 years old.  That's how bad that was.  I'm running down the hall, clenching.  Fuck, I should have got that on.  I got to start.  Holy, holy mackerel. 
[00:26:00]  That is like, oh, you know when you're sitting there, it's like, it feels like there's a knife  inside you trying to come out.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's one of those shits, though.  It's over already, right?  Yeah, yeah, that came in.  And then it was followed by enough gas to, like, launch the shuttle.  There must have been a pocket in there.  Just pushing everything out.  It was like that fucking oil rig show that's on Discovery.  Did it come out at the same time so that you just airbrushed the entire inside of the bowl? 
[00:26:30]  No, at first it came out, and then all the gaseous fumes came out.  Jesus.  And I must say, it smells like an oil refinery in here.  Did it come out like beef stew?  Yeah, pretty much the consistency of beef stew.  Beef stew.  And then just this gurgling, it sounds like a sucking chest wound.  Was it spicy?  Yeah, it's a little, not very bad. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It's like, I'm not going to have to sit here for an hour.  All right.  But, yeah.  Well, you carry on.  Wow.  All right, I'll be back in a flash.  All right, there's Anthony, live from the bathroom, shitting himself.  Fly fishing is not a sport you'll learn in one day.  Jimmy James, you'll be in the river with J.W. Trout and R.K. Whale.  Opie can practice on Long Island.  If that's Tony Brooklyn, if you don't know how to fish, don't waste your time. 
[00:27:30]  I agree with you, John, in Kingston.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll get Anthony back in here.  Larry King.  Holy shit.  Larry King was talking to a rape victim, this Philip Garrido.  Is that how you say his name?  The ghoul that had that girl in his backyard for 18 years?  I think that's how you say it, Garrido.  Well, back in 1976, he kidnapped and raped this woman. 
[00:28:00]  And I believe he did 11 years in prison.  So he should have never been in a position to kidnap this young teenage girl and have her in his backyard for 18 years.  Well, anyway, the victim from the 1976 crime was on Larry King.  And Larry King, how he interviewed this rape victim, it's just unbelievable.  It's one for the ages.  It could be one of the best things ever that Larry King has done.  So we're going to do that after the break.  As we go to break, talking about Bob Kelly. 
[00:28:30]  Butcher put this together from Bob Kelly's last appearance on the show.  Join us as comedian and psychoanalyst Bob Kelly discusses Anthony Cumia's Need to Be Loved.  Everything everybody in this room does is a scream to fucking love me.  You are banging nails, you fucking afro faggot.  You're the only cocksucker that went backwards in his career.  You're supposed to start with a podcast and work your way up to a hit show, not work your way backwards, fuckhead.  Damn.  You're on fucking at two in the morning on the internet. 
[00:29:00]  I know.  We're all screaming for someone to love us, okay?  It just so happens, I do it in 140 characters.  I didn't buy a TV studio and put it in my mansion and go on and hire fucking all my friends to come over and hang with me, okay?  Yeah, it's called hire.  When you buy booze, that's fucking money.  That's fucking monetary fucking gain for these guys.  If you didn't have shit over there, if you had fucking pretzels, would Danny show up?  No.  Probably.  No.  He's got a fucking fat Guinness in his hand and he gets to drink for free all night over some tap you have downstairs. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Bobby is really good.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Satellite.  Radio.  Oh.  We're on 197 on one of the things and 202 on the other thing.  What do you got in? 
[00:30:00]  Who's that playing tennis there?  Did you play last night?  Who's the hot tennis broad this year?  Shara fucking Parastrova.  She's the new Ova girl.  Every year you got to have a new Ova girl.  Yeah, it's Sharapova.  The U.S. Open.  She was injured, I guess, last year.  Yeah, Sharapova's all right.  Dude, Sharapova's pretty hot.  Well, from behind, yeah.  She ain't bad from the front, neither.  Give Sharapova shot.  Sharapova's pretty fucking...  Look at that.  She's... 
[00:30:30]  I dig that.  I like that Sharapova.  You know when I went on that honeymoon of mine, she was there.  Really?  She's a monster.  What do you mean a monster?  She is a monster.  Oh, she's cute.  She is...  I don't consider myself short.  Oh, God damn.  I'm about six foot with shoes.  Yeah.  With shoes, I call it.  With shoes.  And she was definitely way taller than me.  And she was...  She was...  Dude, she's a monster, though.  Dude, I don't care.  Yeah, that's...  Proportion monster is fine. 
[00:31:00]  Proportion monster is all right?  Yeah, because she just looks statuesque.  Yeah.  She looks statuesque.  She's a big girl, but she is in proportion.  I mean, she's...  I don't like her.  She's not a beast.  She's a monster.  You know who the beast is.  Yeah, the beast as well.  The one Williams sister is a beast.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  She's a height.  She's sitting in a director's chair.  I think there's...  With another director's chair in front of her, and I feed her up, and you can see camel toe  and shit.  Yeah, that's definitely a good picture.  I think there's a hotter Nova out there, though. 
[00:31:30]  A hotter Ova?  Ova.  Right.  Ova.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah.  I mean...  I'm not going to complain about that.  Yeah, but it's not in proportion.  If you put another girl next to her, you would see how big she actually is.  But that's hot.  She's big in proportion.  I want to have sex with a giant woman.  Jerry, I want to have sex with a giant woman.  That was a good Seinfeld episode.  He want to have sex with a giant.  God damn. 
[00:32:00]  No, she's a fucking sexy ass Ova.  She's a big Ova.  You know what?  Remember many moons ago, I would bitch relentlessly about Russian strippers.  I still don't like that attitude that they have, but I must say, they are fucking hot  as a motherfucker.  Those bodies on those girls, when they drag them over here, I'll say, that's just nice.  Oh, gosh. 
[00:32:30]  I think...  The bodies on these strippers, you totally threw me with that.  He just put fucking Shara Bowman in a bikini laying on her side picture.  I just think there's a better Ova.  Wow, you see the picture of her swallowing the banana?  No way.  In between sets?  You missed that one, Dan.  Look at that, dude.  Right?  Go down there.  So smoky.  Oh, no.  Oh, you motherfucker.  Oh, boo.  That's a good picture.  Yeah, she's swallowing a banana in between sets.  Wow, she likes bananas. 
[00:33:00]  Well, I think the photographer likes to take pictures of her swallowing bananas.  Oh, wow.  Jesus, that's not right.  That's a hot shot.  She's got her little visor on, and her mouth is agape, and she's just shoving a banana  in there.  Well, she needs nutrition before the match.  Of course.  Yeah, the Russian broads are put together well, huh?  Yeah, like you go to a strip club, and you see these Russian broads and Ukrainian broads  and shit like that.  They just...  Their bodies are fucking, like, smoking.  They got some facial thing that you could tell they're Russian by looking at them. 
[00:33:30]  Usually, like, one of those moles or...  No, no, that's a little later.  You hope not to see one of those moles.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Especially the invisible ones?  Eastern block fucking mole shit.  Yeah.  Mole that pops out of nowhere like it's a tumor?  Jesus, what is that about?  What the fuck happened in your country?  So, let's find a hotter Nova, though.  A hotter Nova.  Nova.  Nova.  Yeah.  I keep messing it up. 
[00:34:00]  Nova.  Nova?  It could be an Nova.  I think there's a hotter woman playing in the U.S. Open this year.  Really?  I think.  Where is the artist formerly known as Big Titted Monster?  Is she...  No one cares about her anymore.  Is she all her tits cut off?  Yeah, she had them reduced drastically, and now no one cares.  Obviously, she isn't playing.  She's probably still recouping.  Well, she's in the junior circuit.  Oh.  She's a junior tennis player.  Well.  What have we got here?  Anthony, Larry King. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Actually, we got a lot of Larry King because Dominic Barber...  Dominic Barber was on Larry King with the husband of the broad that went the wrong way  and killed everybody.  Yeah, this...  A month and a half ago.  Dominic has hitched his wagon to this fucking story.  Before we go to him, though, I got to play the clip that I played for you this morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, you got this guy, Philip Garrido.  Yeah.  How do you say his name?  Garrido.  Something like that?  Yeah.  He was the one that had the teenage girl in his backyard for 18 years. 
[00:35:00]  Now she's 29, and she has two kids with this ghoul.  Yeah.  Turns out this guy kidnapped and raped this woman back in 1976.  Ah.  And he did 11 years, I believe, for this crime.  11 years.  Supposedly, he was supposed to do 50.  Supposedly, this guy was not really supposed to ever be out again.  Yeah.  But all of a sudden, you know, a few years ticked by, and you assume that he's still in jail,  and he's out somewhere.  Yeah.  Oh, he was a model prisoner.  Oh, was he? 
[00:35:30]  Really?  Was he?  Yeah.  And then they let him out.  And yeah, the reason they're a model prisoner is because they're in prison.  Right.  You let them out amongst the populace, and they start killing again.  So, this woman was minding her own business, and she was picking up food for her then-boyfriend,  I believe.  Yeah.  And somehow...  Guy came by with a van and wanted help with a chair.  Yeah.  I believe his arm was broken.  But somehow, this girl picked up Philip Garrido back in 1976, and then, you know, horrific  things were done to her. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Larry King, though, is the dumbest interviewer ever.  He used to be the best interviewer.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  He used to be an amazing interviewer.  He made it seem effortless.  That's how he made his bones.  Right.  You know, years ago, he'd get the big celebrities.  They would sit there, and the Larry King interviewer's a big thing.  Who's that?  Oh, my God.  There you go.  The hottest ova.  It's another ova.  That's an ova?  Daniella Hantachova.  Daniella Hantachova. 
[00:36:30]  Is the hottest ova.  Let me see some pictures of her.  Sure.  How about that one?  Playing tennis.  Oh, wait a minute.  She looks a little haggard there.  A little manly there, too.  She's in the middle of serving.  Yeah, but that's crazy.  Yeah, let's get a hot picture of her.  Hmm.  All right.  Okay.  Let's see if she's a hot ova.  Hantachova.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, she's not bad.  Yeah.  How old is she?  She needs just a little more miracle grow.  She'll be all right.  Yeah, yeah.  What's that one? 
[00:37:00]  Is that her?  Apparently.  All right.  Let's take a look at the...  Oh.  Yeah.  She looks angry, though.  She looks like an angry Russian stripper.  Yeah, she looks like a Russian stripper, which is no problem there.  Expressionless.  Not as good as the other ova.  Yeah.  All right.  That's not a bad ova, though.  That's a good ova.  There's a lot of ovas.  Jesus Christ.  I'm looking at the U.S. Open women's list.  Really?  A lot of ovas.  Is there really a lot of ovas?  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  All right.  Keep looking at the ovas.  Find us another ova.  Find another hot ova.  So the woman is picking up food. 
[00:37:30]  Philip Garrido somehow talked her into driving him home or something.  What a guy.  And she was raped repeatedly for eight hours.  She's telling her horrific story on Larry King.  Listen closely to what Larry King is concerned with during the description of the rape.  As I came out of the grocery store and got my car, Philip knocked on my window and said,  you know, I can't seem to get my car to start.  It's cold. 
[00:38:00]  Do you think he'd give me a ride?  You know, which way are you going?  And of course, he was going to go any way, any which way I was going.  And so I did.  Why did you let him in the car?  I don't know.  It was the worst decision I've ever made, I think.  I guess.  It truly was.  Well, she's stupid.  She's not sure if that's the worst decision she ever made.  She's not sure.  Yeah.  What comes in second to an eight hour raping?  I think that's the worst decision I ever made.  I think.  She's not really sure, Anthony.  As that or buying Citadel stock. 
[00:38:30]  I remember both of them was it was a rape, an ass raping.  But I want to take this rape thing lightly.  Of course.  But I would really have to think hard.  What was the worst fucking ass raping?  I might want to be raped for eight hours than taking on that IPO back five, six years ago.  Fucker.  Why did you let him in the car?  I don't know.  It was the worst decision I've ever made, I think.  It truly was. 
[00:39:00]  What happened when he got in?  When he got in, I filled his hands with a lot of food that I had in the front seat anyway.  I tried to engage him.  He was holding your food?  He was.  I tried to engage him in small conversation on the trip.  I tried to stay on the main street.  And when I got ready to turn, he said, well, where I'm staying is right up the road here.  So I took him a little further up and then just turned around the corner and pulled over.  And he slammed my head into the steering wheel and pulled out handcuffs. 
[00:39:30]  He took my keys out, threw him on the floor, and pulled out handcuffs and handcuffed me.  And said, I just want a piece of ass.  If you'd be good, you won't get hurt.  Wow.  I stop it there because that is a very vivid description of what this guy did to this woman, right?  Yeah, that's a pretty horrible setup to an eight-hour raping.  Right.  So after you hear that as an interviewer... 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  What have you taken in from that story?  I'm going to back up a little bit.  So you hear the end of that horrific description of what happened leading up to the rape.  And as an interviewer, you would take in what she's saying...  Right.  ...and then formulate a question, a statement, something that has to do with that story...  Right.  ...and the impact of it.  I think I would go with, just off the top of my head, did you think you were going to die?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Or...  Did you think you were going to die?  What was going on in your head at that moment? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Did you try to escape?  Right.  Anything like that.  Where you were so physically hurt that you couldn't fight back.  And that's just us just kind of riffing off the top of our heads.  Off the top of our heads.  And we don't have an interview show on CNN that's seen around the world.  No.  Well, here's Larry King's question after that.  Here's what he got from that story.  I backed up a little bit just leading up to the Larry King question.  He took my keys out, threw him on the floor, and pulled out handcuffs, and handcuffed me,  and said, I just want a piece of ass. 
[00:41:00]  If you'd be good, you won't get hurt.  What did he do with the food?  He put it on the floor, I guess.  I don't know.  I was just...  You've got to be shitting me.  Dude, a college radio guy would come up with a better question than Larry King did right there.  That is...  He's concerned about the food after that amazing description she just told.  What did he do with the food?  Did you get coupons? 
[00:41:30]  Did you use coupons?  Did you have one of those cards?  What did he do with the food?  What the fuck was he listening to?  She tells a horror story of this guy knocking her head against the steering wheel.  Right.  Handcuffs.  Eight-hour rape.  Right.  Right.  Slamming her head against the steering wheel to basically make her a bit woozy.  I want a piece of ass.  I want...  Right.  And that's what Larry garnered from that conversation. 
[00:42:00]  And you can hear in her voice, like, what?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a delay there.  The food?  There's a delay there.  And it's like...  She's trying to go be like, what?  This guy didn't just ask me that, did he?  Yeah.  Once again.  He pulled out handcuffs.  He took my keys out, threw him on the floor, and pulled out handcuffs and handcuffed me and  said, I just want a piece of ass.  If you'd be good, you won't get hurt.  What'd he do with the food?  He put it on the floor, I guess.  I don't know. 
[00:42:30]  I was just...  Yeah.  Yeah.  He put it on the floor, I guess.  I guess.  I don't know, Larry, because my head was against the steering wheel, and I was half unconscious  at that point.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I put it on the floor.  I don't know, Larry.  I was being raped.  I don't know.  Really.  I really wasn't concentrating on, hey, you know, be careful with those.  There's eggs in there.  Right.  Because after a good raping, I'm going to be hungry.  I hope you don't destroy my food.  Please, Mr. Rapist, could you get this done with quick?  I have ice cream in there, and it's going to melt.  What do you think he did with the food, Larry? 
[00:43:00]  What did he do with the food?  He probably threw it out the window.  He's fucking insane to ask that question.  Right.  Amazing.  And we're off.  And we're off.  Let's start with Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Did you have paper or plastic?  Yeah.  What type of bag did you use?  I don't mean a condom.  Right.  Paper or plastic?  Did they double bag it?  Did he double bag it? 
[00:43:30]  What kind of food was it?  Jesus.  Now, the steering wheel where your head was wrapped into.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Larry.  So you want to talk about that?  Yes, my head was hit against the steering wheel.  Leather or wood steering wheel?  Right.  Was it one with the horn that you had to push with your two thumbs?  Or one in the middle, like the old days?  I appreciate the one right in the middle.  After the eight-hour rape, did you get to read your fortune?  What the fuck? 
[00:44:00]  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Was there grape juice or garlic in the bag?  Did you purchase Welch's grape juice?  Did it look like Welch's was pouring out of your bung?  You know what?  Get it over with.  Just move Anderson Cooper into the slot.  Yeah.  That's obviously that's going to happen eventually.  Just move it along already.  This poor woman talking about her rape, and Larry goes, what did he do with the food? 
[00:44:30]  Let's say how to Bob in Indiana.  Bob.  Hey, did he pour the chocolate syrup on your nipples before he started?  I like your impression.  You really gave it your all.  I'm trying, Ant.  Damn it.  I'm trying.  I've been up all night working.  Just rugged your voice up, asshole.  At least try.  Even I could do a Larry King.  Everyone can do a Larry King.  You just do this.  Everyone can do a Larry King but me, damn it.  All right, bro.  Automatic transmission or manual shift. 
[00:45:00]  What was it?  Jack in South Carolina.  Jack.  So tell me, what radio station was he playing when he was raping you for an hour?  Was it Barry White?  Did you at least get to listen to your favorite song?  Was it a twofer from Skinner?  Donna wants to know.  It was the extended version of Stairway to Heaven.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Did she have 12 items or less? 
[00:45:30]  12 items or less.  Did you go through with 13 or 14 items, thus deserving what you got?  You know, we have to play one more time.  Oh, please.  She's just describing.  She's boggled, too.  Something horrific.  Boggled at his answer.  Turned around the corner and pulled over and he slammed my head into the steering wheel  and pulled out handcuffs.  He took my keys out, threw him on the floor and pulled out handcuffs and handcuffed me 
[00:46:00]  and said, I just want a piece of ass.  If you'd be good, you won't get hurt.  What did he do with the food?  He put it on the floor, I guess.  I don't know.  I was just...  She wanted to reach over and just smack him.  I guess he put it on the floor, Larry.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did you ever find your keys that were on the floor with the groceries?  Must have been hard to find.  Don't you hate when you can't find your keys after an eight-hour rape?  I don't know, Larry.  I wasn't concerned with the food. 
[00:46:30]  I was worried about my asshole being stretched out by this monster.  What the fuck?  What was in your glove box?  Do you keep gloves in there?  Let me say hi to Sean in wherever.  Sean, what's up, buddy?  How important was the steering wheel to the rape?  Of course.  Bill, what do you got, Bill?  Did your husband slap you around for his dinner being late? 
[00:47:00]  Right.  Did he at least get to eat the food?  What happened with the food?  That's all I care about.  That's amazing, isn't it?  What a fucking lunatic.  I'm a lunatic to ask that.  And then we got a second part to this.  Larry King, yeah, he handles the conversation of rape very delicately and with tact.  Listen to how he, I guess when you're interviewing a rape victim, it's not an easy thing.  Larry just, like a robot, though. 
[00:47:30]  No emotion to the fact that she's spilling her guts out about this rape.  Some emotion, a little tact.  Right.  A little sympathy.  Right.  Something like that.  Right.  All right.  Now you're in a car.  You're handcuffed.  How does this happen?  How does this happen?  How does this happen?  Run me through the details.  How big was his cock?  How does this happen?  She just, first of all, told him how it happened.  Right. 
[00:48:00]  So there's no like, how did it happen?  How did she get in that position?  Because she's already answered that.  What does he want to know?  Like, how does it happen?  What, what happens next?  All right.  Now you're in a car.  You're handcuffed.  How does this happen?  How, how was he able to consummate this?  Well, Jesus, Larry, you fucking pervert.  Isn't it like, how is he able to sexually assault you?  Something, consummate is something you do on your wedding night.  You consummate your marriage. 
[00:48:30]  How did he get his penis in your vagina?  Yes.  How, how did the lovemaking go?  Right.  When he was making love to you.  What do you, what do you think, Larry?  Holy shit.  Or like the newlywed game.  When you were making whoopee.  How did, consummate.  When it comes to rape.  It's a sexual fucking assault, Larry.  It's not consummating.  Holy shit.  When you were being romantically involved with this gentleman. 
[00:49:00]  As you were handcuffed.  And the food was, what did you say, on the floor?  Holy shit.  When you were making whoopee.  Did he have, did he have an, if this van is rocking, don't come knocking bumper sticker.  Did he have an ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free sticker.  I used to have one of those on my Ford Econoline van. 
[00:49:30]  Back in the 70s, with my Molly Hatchet airbrush paint mural on the side.  Let's go to Dan in Cleveland.  Dan.  How important is the cock in an ass raping?  No shit.  Larry is a douche.  Let's go to Chris in the Poconos.  Chris.  Did you have leather or fabric seats?  Yeah, because leather is easier to clean after you make love to somebody. 
[00:50:00]  J.W. Driver, check it in.  He writes, J.W. Driver.  Does AAA cover unlocking handcuffs?  Holy shit.  Were there tampons in your grocery bag?  You know what I mean.  Were you, uh...  Trucker Bob.  Trucker Bob.  Were the handcuffs fur-lined?  Fur-lined handcuffs.  Were they novelty or real handcuffs? 
[00:50:30]  Why didn't you try to say a voop and get out of them?  Much like Ed Norton in The Honeymooners.  See you, boys.  Did you boop your way out of the cuffs?  Let's go to Booger Couch.  Booger Couch.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Hey, I heard she changed the worst decision she ever made from picking up a rapist to being interviewed by Larry Hatch.  Would the car have qualified for a cash for clunkers?  Billy. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, Billy.  Hey, listen.  I think he actually set up the food question, if you rewind the tape a bit.  I think he...  Didn't he ask, hey, uh...  Was he carrying your food?  Yeah.  And then she went on and had a follow-up question after that horrific story?  Yeah, he's following up with the food question.  Well, since he had the food, how did he rape you holding the food?  Yeah, but that's stuff you don't have to ask.  The food was obviously on the passenger seat.  You pick up the rapist dude.  He's holding the food now because...  Who gives a shit about the food? 
[00:51:30]  Obviously, he just threw the food about.  Yeah.  Who cares?  He flung it.  You know he's not hearing anything she's saying.  No, of course not.  He's just like, all right, I'm going to nail this one home with a follow-up.  Yeah, of course.  What did he do with the food?  Yeah, of course.  Let's go to Shane in the Bronx.  Shane.  I want to know, did you get garlic and did you pay cash for credit?  And, uh, very good.  Oh, God.  Let's go to Franco in Oceanside.  Franco.  Were you illegally parked? 
[00:52:00]  Just, he fucking is inept.  All right, now you're in a car, you're handcuffed.  How does this happen?  How was he able to consummate this?  Well, you mean how was he able to handcuff me?  Yeah, no, rape you.  Oh, well, he took me to a mini-work.  No, rape you.  How was he able to rape you?  Well, uh, Larry, he pretty much put his penis where I didn't want it.  Right.  Rape is pretty vicious, Larry. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  You don't need to know how.  How did he rape you?  Well, I'm cuffed.  Right.  And, uh, my head fucking was smashed against the steering wheel.  Uh, I don't know, Larry, you figure it out.  Like, you could have figured out the food question.  Who gives a shit?  No, rape you.  Oh, well, he took me to a mini-warehouse.  Well, he took you out of there.  Yes, he, um, he transferred me after he handcuffed me.  He transferred me into the passenger seat.  He pulled a leather strap out of his hair.  And he tied my head to my knees.  Were you fearing for your life? 
[00:53:00]  I was.  I thought I was dead.  There you go.  Well, there's this.  And then he, what, raped you repeatedly?  Uh-huh.  How repeatedly was it?  She was getting pissed.  Uh, Sam's got to find the longer version of this because it goes on and on.  Dude, if, if he used the leather thing to tie her head to her knees.  No kidding.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Uh, let me say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  Charlie.  What's up, boy?  Hey, Charlie.  Are you going to send him the bill for the car being detailed because he made a mess of it? 
[00:53:30]  Did he pay?  Did he pay for the food he wrecked?  Right.  Uh, let's go to Mike in Chicago.  Mike.  Did your guy have bench or bucket seats?  Very important to the rape.  Of course.  All that stuff.  Very important.  What did he do with the food?  Larry.  What did he do with the food?  Just cannot conduct an interview. 
[00:54:00]  It's, it's embarrassingly bad.  Let's say hi to Perry in Jersey.  Perry.  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Did he engage the childproof locks to prevent you from fleeing?  All right.  All right.  I like, I like your Dr. Evo delivery.  Did he slip it into your hot pocket?  They're quite delicious, you know. 
[00:54:30]  Uh, Bob in Florida.  Bob.  Did he have that shit growing on his nose 35 years ago?  Yeah.  What is that shit?  Uh, uh, Tim in Texas.  Tim.  Did he know you're biblically in the rumble seat?  Did he know you're biblically in the rumble seat?  Did, uh, Larry Fishmonger, did the Jiffy Loops sticker on your windshield indicate you need 
[00:55:00]  an oil change?  what was the odometer reading  fucking Larry  John and Buffalo  what was more forced  this interview or his entry  there's no reason 
[00:55:30]  Jimmy and DC  the rape  well she couldn't even understand him saying  consummate  like that fucking blew right by her  I don't think  Jimmy  did your mouth say no  but your eyes say yes  he handled that pretty delicately right  oh yeah  unbelievable  he's good like that Larry  but the longer version of the clip  Larry just really really 
[00:56:00]  just gets insensitive  oh yeah  he wants details of the rape itself  oh yeah  oh yeah  see it's not  you can't really  you don't really need details of  of a raping  complete  huh  I'm just reading the definition of consummate  right  to bring to a state of perfection  fulfill  to complete an arrangement agreement  or the like  by a pledge 
[00:56:30]  or signing of a contract  to complete the union  of a marriage  by the first marital sexual intercourse  this guy  could not have used  a worse word  aside from saying  something like making love  oh  Andy in Staten Island  Andy  good morning  did he make thumbsies in the car  yeah 
[00:57:00]  well you get the idea  good old Larry King  at it again  when your head was tied  between your legs  did you see any dried up  McDonald's french fries  in the seats  well Larry also had  Diane Shuler's husband on last night  with Dominic Barber  yes  with Dominic Barber  apparently the husband  cannot  cannot deal with the fact  that the coroners  have come up with the  conclusion that his wife  was tanked  and stoned 
[00:57:30]  when she killed  eight people  driving the wrong way  down the Taconic Parkway  yeah  about a month or so  I think  I think he should just  let this rest  yeah well  with the likes of  Dominic Barber  anchored to this story  now  he won't let it go  he won't let it go  Dominic loves  being on television  he loves publicity  and he's got it  with this  so he joined  this husband  on Larry King  last night  so we got a little 
[00:58:00]  yeah we got a little  of that  a little taste of that  oh good  I don't know  maybe  we'll see what this  is all about  almost  now four calls  were then made  to and from  Diana's car  en route  and one of those  calls apparently  sounded fine  discussing future  plans with her  sister-in-law  what can you tell  us about that  well Dominic  you would have to  well the four phone  calls that are made  the four phone calls  the four phone calls  ugh  why is she being raped  the four phone calls 
[00:58:30]  yeah  the four phone calls  that were made  the four phone calls  well Dominic  you field this one  well the four phone calls  that are made  the first phone call  and the second phone call  are fine  by the third phone call  from what we understand  she sounds as if  she's had  some sort of a  psychiatric  or stroke type issue  she is unable  to see  clearly  and she is saying  words in a very 
[00:59:00]  strange fashion  not in an  alcoholic fashion  you just described  someone that is  pounding vodka  was it vodka  yeah  right  and the legal limit  was just  off the charts  off the fucking charts  she had double the legal limit  yeah it wasn't close  to the legal limit  and there was still  undigested vodka  in her stomach  the fat fan cards  not in an  alcoholic  fashion  oh how was it then  she  says she can't  see you straight  right  she's fucking 
[00:59:30]  talking weird  he just described  someone that is  shit faced  right  smatted  right  the vodka  took hold  and the coroner's  report said it  mm-hmm  oh jesus  dominic  you look like  you eat a lot  of food  if a rape victim  had to put her  food aside  would you have  eaten all of it  now are we  saying here  daniel  are you saying  that the authorities  are lying 
[01:00:00]  when they say  there was  0.19  of alcohol  and evidence  of marijuana  are you saying  they're making  that up  i know my wife  was not drinking  she doesn't drink  very rarely  so why  why would the  authorities say that  there's an error  there's an error  somewhere  an error  okay we'll take  we'll take a break  well thanks  Larry  well we'll take  a break  to getting more  out of him  he goes my wife  doesn't drink  only occasionally 
[01:00:30]  well that must have  been the occasion  yeah  because that's what  the coroners are  saying  and dr bodden  said they should  take a hair sample  because you could  tell if somebody  um has been  uh an alcoholic  for years  buy a hair sample  really  dr bodden  that creepy  knows his shit  he knows uh  how to get  the answers  from a  from a  from a corpse  yes you can  get it from  the hair  but you also  must pull  the colon  out of their  belly button  and scrape  the colon wall 
[01:01:00]  that ghoul  he's such a ghoul  he is a ghoul  he just loves  death  you can do it  with the hair  or you can  put your  hand through  the chest  and go  ghoul  and pull  the heart  out  ghoul  you think  bodden  like just  throws dead  animals around  his apartment  for potpourri  he loves it  instead of  scented candles  he just picks 
[01:01:30]  up roadkill  and tosses it  about  the autopsy  you must  like the  ancient  Egyptians  pull the  brain  out of  the  nostrils  it's the  best way  to find out  if she  had been  drinking  a creep  what is  this  hold on  a minute  my  in North  Carolina  Marie  that's great  yeah  the song  playing on  the radio  pussy control 
[01:02:00]  yep  how you guys  doing  I listen to  you guys  all the  time  that's  the first  time  I've ever  got on  the radio  and  what song  we're playing  pussy control  yep  pussy control  yeah  yeah  that's a good one  so why  why are you  calling about  that  why are you  calling about  that  I can't  hear you  I'm in  a real  bad area  I'm in  North Carolina  right now  I'm traveling  yeah 
[01:02:30]  why are you  calling about  the song  we're playing  well because  they've been  trying to get  through to tell  you the name  of the song  on the video  that was  playing while  he was  raping her  oh  wow  see  yeah  pussy control  was playing  on the radio  because he  was  yeah  in control  of  the food 
[01:03:00]  right  what  we got the  long rape clip  oh  yeah  because Larry  just kept  going on  and on  like  she gave  enough  description  of the  rape  but Larry  just kept  going  and going  and going  details  to spank  to later  you want  to do  ADD radio  or you want  to continue  with Dominic  Barber  first  let's do  Dominic  Barber  then we'll  move back  to the  long rape  clip  okay  a spokesman  with the  New York  police department  told us  today that  levels were  indicative  of Mrs.  Shuler  smoking marijuana  anywhere from 
[01:03:30]  15 minutes  to one hour  of the accident  now since he  won't discuss  marijuana  Dominic  how do you  explain that  now  you know  the New York  city police  are not  well  as the state  police  number one  but number  two  I can assure  you that  if it ever  occurs  and it probably  will never  that if I  cross examine  that expert  you're not  going to  ever hear  that there  was marijuana  smoked  within that  short period  of time  why  why  explain why  if you  cross examine 
[01:04:00]  that guy  oh my god  and then  this is why  we're playing  this today  Dominic  Barber makes  the big  announcement  it's like a  concert announcement  yeah yeah  it's like he's  announcing a  concert  think of your  favorite radio  station when  they have that  big concert  announcement  make sure  you're tuned  in at 5pm  because we're  going to have  a big  announcement  to make  about something  very special  that you're  going to be  interested  a little  here's the  big announcement  from Dominic  Barber  yeah  when we learn  more do you  want the body  exhumed  well we're 
[01:04:30]  going to announce  it tonight  yes  what  the body  will be  exhumed  yeah  you're going  to have to  pay the cost  right  of course  that's not a  problem  yeah it's not  a problem  that's not a  problem  because I'm  not paying  right of course  that's why it's  not a problem  he's sitting  Dominic's pulling  money out of his  pocket to  exhume a body  and the way  he says it  it's like  we're announcing  it tonight  tonight  on your show  Larry  we're exhuming  the body  just another 
[01:05:00]  insensitive  fucking creep  I wonder who's  going to warm  up for the  exhuming of the  body  yeah  yeah  gotta have a  warm-up band  Dr.  Barden  perhaps  or maybe a  warm-up  exhuming of  the body  of somebody  else  yeah  they'll exhume  somebody else  not as  in the news  right  right  just to get  the whole  thing going  oh  he made  a big  announcement  that they're  exhuming  the body  now are  they going  to allow  anybody 
[01:05:30]  else to  do any  testing on  this  after it's  exhumed  I would  guess because  this guy's  footing the  bill  to exhume  the body  that it  will be  their  experts  and their  experts  are going  to be  biased  that's why  that whole  thing is  just a  crock  of  shit  because  you have  your  expert  to look  at the  body  after  exhume  it  of course  the expert  is going  to give  you the  answers  that you're  hoping  that you  want  because  why  wouldn't  you  you're  also  paying  that  expert  right  there's  a  cases 
[01:06:00]  there's  certain  cases  where  they will  bring in  financial  people  and they  will  look  through  the  books  of  people's  personal  finances  company  finances  things like  that  and come  up with  different  figures  even  though  it's  math  it's  just  basic  math  but  the  defense  will  come up  with  different  answers  than the  prosecution  or the  plaintiff  and defendant  come up 
[01:06:30]  with different  answers  obviously  it's because  one person  is being  paid by  one side  one person  is being  paid by  the other  but when  you have  the state  doing the  autopsy  which happened  with this  woman  you know  they're  supposed to  be  and for  the most  part  pretty  unbiased  they're just  doing the  autopsy  unbelievable  you watch  they'll  exhume  this  body  Dominic  Barbara  will  just  bilk  this  guy  he'll  be paying  money 
[01:07:00]  for  experts  and all  this other  shit  and they'll  get the  answers  they need  and they'll  say  well  we have  signs  that there  could have  been a  lesion  on the  brain  or this  or that  or that  it'll be  anything  but  she was  drunk  and stoned  right  well  that's  what  you're  getting  that's  what  you're  paying  for  right  because  the  expert  is told  ahead  of  time  we need  find  them  we need  something  here  so you  you dig  up that  corpse  and go  to town  yeah  nothing  creepier  than seeing  like  the  tractor  in a 
[01:07:30]  graveyard  it's  always like  a rainy  muddy  day  as they're  digging  up a  body  and it  hasn't  been  that  long  so  the  coffin  won't  really  be  that  dirty  right  so  you know  for  some  reason  I was  watching  a show  just  yesterday  on  mummies  mummies  in  Italy  and  underground  apparently  they mummified  a lot of  priests  and shit  like that  oh yeah  and for  some reason  you could  just show  fucking  dead people  as long  as enough  time  passed  of course  these were  dead people  from the  1700s  and shit  right  and just 
[01:08:00]  horrific  like faces  that are  like  because they're  all mummies  and their jaws  are all in  the leather  skin  and shit  like that  they're all  in the middle  of singing  opera  yeah  they're like  just creepy  but the new  dead bodies  you can't  really show  that  hell no  no  you don't  want to  see when  they crack  that lid  open on  that fucking  woman  we're not  going to  see Michael  Jackson  for 200  years  200 years  and all  of a sudden  they'll put  him on display  somewhere  yes  in museums  across America 
[01:08:30]  back on tour  Larry King  so some of this  audio you heard  already  obviously  but here's  the long  version of the  clip we've been  messing with  where he tries  to hot it up  he just keeps  going and going  like we get  the point  she was  horrifically raped  for 8 hours  in a warehouse  but listen to this  details  and now you're  in a car  you're handcuffed  how does this  happen  how was he able  to consummate  this  well  you mean  how was he  able to  handcuff me  no rape you  oh  well he took  me to a  mini warehouse  oh he took

[01:10:00]  head tied  between her  fucking legs  how'd it  finally end  how'd you  get out  of there  how'd you  get home  right  that type  of thing  but no  did he have  a knife  or threaten  you with  any weapon  no I didn't  I never saw  any weapon  I don't  you know  most of the  actual rape  has just been  totally blocked  out of my head  was it on the  floor  on a bed  he had  he had me  he took me  what the fuck  on a bed  did he sprinkle  rose petals  on the bed  right  was it romantic  what song was  playing  did you have  candlelight  well Larry

[01:11:30]  are heavy  and about  a foot  behind that  was another  wall of carpet  with the opening  at the other  end  and then another  one behind that  it was like a  maze  and in the  back part of  the mini  warehouse where  he had me  he had it  set up to  keep someone  for a while  he had a  mattress  you're a pretty  good observer  though  well I only saw  this on the  way out  holy shit  pretty good  observer  observer  really  you're a good  observer  really Larry  it's not like  you're trying to  remember what  you did last  Wednesday  estimate how

[01:16:00]  Keanu Reeves  45  has he  stopped  making movies  yeah  what was  the last  piece of  shit  he put out  I couldn't  tell you  the last  movie he  was in  the  lake house  what  for real  I don't  know  the lake  house  what was  his last  movie  or is he  busy with  his band  I think 
[01:16:30]  the last  thing that  anybody  actually  heard of  was the  day the  earth  stood  still  oh  right  okay  he was  in that  piece  of  dreck  I saw  that  that was  pretty  awful  I didn't  see that  I just  don't go to  the movies  anymore  nah  that one's  like out  I mean  I want  to go to  the movies  nah  that's  an older  movie  now  but  I want  to go  to the  movies  but  there's  never  anything  to see  yeah  I don't  know what's  going on  with that  shit  I wait  for him  to show  up in  hotel rooms  okay  this is  good  what's 
[01:17:00]  up with  the  California  fires  we're  alright  now  yeah  everything's  fine  alright  good  let's  move  on to  the  John  Sterling  phone  call  John  Sterling  home run  call  home run  call  home run  call  yes  we were  being  quizzed  by  Travis  on this  one  did we  get the  answer  no  did we  get the  answer  he walked  out of  the  room  no  we  you're  not  going to  see it  coming  now  this  isn't  one  like  we  know  when  A-Rod  hits  a  home  run  no  I  never  heard  this  one  yet  it's  an  A-bomb 
[01:17:30]  from  A-Rod  and then  the  Yankees  win  somebody  looped  that  in a  video  on my  Twitter  I  got to  retweet  that  I forgot  to retweet  that  last  night  if  that guy  is listening  send it  to me  again  so I  can send  it  out  to  everybody  else  what a  dush  and  you know  he has  these  fucking  lame  ass  calls  for  every  player  when  they  hit  a  home  run  yeah 
[01:18:00]  now  who  homered  there  Travis  it was  Eric  Hinski  yes  Eric  Hinski  homered  and  I'm  trying to  figure out  what he  would have  said  un  hinged  unhinged  unbelievable  Hinski  and we  threw out  the challenge  a while  ago  is there  another  play-by-play  guy doing  this douchey  shit out  there  being such  a douche  we broadcast  to the  country now 
[01:18:30]  there's got to  be another  guy that's  douchey  like this  that has  something he  does every  time a  home run  is hit  I can't  even  unhinged  believable  I know  well that's  how ridiculous  they are  anyway  alright  let's just  play it  see what  the answer  is  the pitch  swung on  and drilled  the deep  right center  it is high  it is far  it is gone  another home run  for Swisher 
[01:19:00]  at Camden Yards  unbelievable  Nick Swisher  drilled a  two run  home run  in the right  center field  seats  okay I'm  going to  stop it  there  yep  because if  it ended  there  I don't  mind  John Sterling  I like  his excitement  you know  it is high  it is far  and then  it's a  home run  he tells  what happened  he describes  where the  ball went  everything  I don't  mind it  to that  point  and just  real quick  this is  the entire  call  because there  were  back to back 
[01:19:30]  home runs  last night  so that's  why this is  Swisher  so I gave  you the whole  thing  so the  Henske  call is the  second  home run  call  there were  not two  in a row  because  that's a  belly to  belly  right  I wanted  to give  you just  the whole  thing  what does  sports radio  do with  this  do they  praise  John Sterling  or they  have to  be making  fun of  him  they have  to be  yeah I  don't know  I would  think they  would be  making fun  of him  come on 
[01:20:00]  he is  swish  delicious  and the  Yankees  taking  8-6  lead  you know  he is  swish  someone that's  swish  delicious  Steve probably  knows people  that are  swish  delicious  it sucks  that the  guy's last  name is  swisher to  begin with  but I'm  sure if  you asked  him he  would say  look I  don't like  being referred  to as  swisher  licious  could you  knock it  off there  Jan  please  he is 
[01:20:30]  swish  delicious  and the  Yankees  take an  8-6  lead  they got  a fastball  right over  the middle  of the plate  and hit it  out  swisher  is a  great  fastball  hitter  may not  have trouble  with the  breaking ball  but here's  Henske  and he  takes  inside  and the  count  1-0  now Ray  deal  swung on  hit in the  air to  deep left  center  that ball  is high  it is  far  it is  gone  Eric  Henske  hits one  the other  way 
[01:21:00]  right over  the  364  foot side  oh  Henske  with your  best shot  Eric  Henske  drills his  sixth  and the  Yankees  now take  a 9-6  lead  oh the  Yankees  and Swisher  and Henske  hit him  back to  back  and a  belly to  belly  pitches  inside  no no  he did  not say  Henske  with your  best shot  I  never  you know  what  we should 
[01:21:30]  have  came up  with that  one  I  wouldn't  have  come up  with that  as a  goof  Henske  with your  best shot  wow  what a  douche  that  I could  have sat  here  all  fucking  day  and even  if that  came to  my mind  I never  would have  thought  he would  have been  that douchey  to say  that  but  I can't  even say  it  Henske  with your  best shot  Henske  with your  best shot  wow

[01:25:00]  Yankee fan  and was listening to a lot  of games on radio  that would drive me nuts  crazy  but the local guys  they  like I was watching  the local news  and they all do  oh  there was a belly  to belly  last night  they love it  they go with it  I don't know why  you would go with that  all right  all right  god is that  embarrassing  what is the best  fucking like  female wear  that is  really hot

[01:55:00]  it's their name i don't know it's a local thing for it's later knows and it has coconuts right  so it's like because coconuts is funny and wacky for some reason so you got coconuts  here's what i'm saying uh it's it's labor day weekend so i wanted to stay local that's  my rationalization for working there we're doing it okay my horrible career is i couldn't get  anything else so if i say well it's local and i could stay in you know close and drive home at  night yeah i'll do anything like that you know what i mean or i could say uh i'm almost done 
[01:55:30]  it's easier to say the other one you're starting to feel that though a little bit oh it's  fucking the only thing that's rejuvenating me yeah this is rejuvenating you is is is the word  jew is in it uh is two things is this uh documentary we're doing that's going  fucking great awesome and the fact that i'm starting to go back to 12-step meetings i went 
[01:56:00]  to two and last night why were you been getting an urge for something no it's just my my anger  my resentment just lashing out just i can't control really you've been doing that  i know i haven't even seen we would love to see you angry rich no all these years i don't think  i've ever seen you angry except when you fluff your stupid fucking wedge oh yeah  then i see the anger yes first of all uh he probably punches bonnie square in the face when  he gets no oh no but maybe maybe you don't play well on the golf course because you have to 
[01:56:30]  check your fucking messages in between every shot no i don't first of all i play last time we  fucking played i shot three over par on the back nine with a triple bogey and second of all  i i asked what did i shot this huh what did i shoot i hope it should have been heroin okay that's what  it should have been i didn't fuck you i didn't card you have a touch of a burn victim  it's my turn i had a horrendous round  the whole time you gotta fucking babysit him because he's fucking opie from radio and you're no don't 
[01:57:00]  worry listen look at the positive okay at least you don't have to walk into the woods because it's  an environmental area you know he gave me a mulligan because it was in it was an environmental area  some stupid fucking bird in there trying to lay eggs you know that i guess is going extinct you feel  bad for the guy and you gotta talk him down you know it's like therapy and golf at the same time  i think you gave me food poisoning from your stupid sandwich oh yeah he did now he's happy that i 
[01:57:30]  fucking brought this yeah it used to be a goof yeah i was a fucking oh look at this fucking  bitch with the sandwich now it's like where's the sandwich yeah how about those three guys that were  on that fucking uh raft in mexico you know for eight days they would have loved to have my sandwich  you know what i was ranting about your uh your sandwich to my girl last time we played because  you put onions on the uh what the fuck were we eating it made the difference though it was like  chopped up onions uh wow what the fuck was it i don't turkey and swiss i don't eat red meat so 
[01:58:00]  it was like turkey and swiss and shit was it with onions on it the onions made it  fucking onions man oh but so now now now you're going back to these meetings i need to go anyhow  because you can't have 23 years without drinking and and be as fucking dry as you know what i mean  you know it's dry your hair looks moist next to my dryness okay cactus head what i'm saying is  you should be blowing in front of a saloon before a gunfight you fucking hair 
[01:58:30]  it's like dry please maybe in the one picture we all saw  i didn't have any product that picture did make the rounds his hair's i thought you should hear coyotes in  his hair it was really bad so i go to because i have to i have i can't you can't not drink and  just have the anger and resentment and envy and jealousy and all the fucking every deadly sin i  don't know i know there's seven of them so i'm probably like fucking 10 uh so i can't i can't keep 
[01:59:00]  going on you know i gotta control my anger like i was in traffic coming here through a tunnel and  usually i'd be fucking hitting my dashboard or i bite myself but that's normal oh you bite yourself  oh yeah that's a good way to release tension biting myself have you ever been like i used to bite right  above the uh bicep that went between the bicep and the shoulder i did it once and broke a tooth  but what i'm saying is for real well it was one of my loose yeah uh so i you know i don't get me

[02:37:30]  long island so de rosa can you give me a ride so i have to give him so i go okay i'll give you a ride  you know because i just like to hear his fucking his just miserableness in the car he's been in the  business a week and yet he's fucking angry and bitter okay you know so fucking co-emc he's a funny  guy but he's too angry to be he shouldn't be this angry but i love listening to it because it makes 
[02:38:00]  my anger seem calm it is good so i'll give you a ride and as i'm driving i'm in fucking new york  somebody hits my car my bumper oh taking it making a right turn and they just took off and i had to  pay uh a couple hundred bucks to get your bumper fixed yeah they they jimmied it they fixed it instead  of putting a whole new bumper which the guy tried to get me to get a new bumper it's the rose's fault  not mine that's what i'm saying don't you think the rose owes me the money uh well did you offer  to drive him or did he say can i catch a ride with you well he didn't he first asked can i get a ride 
[02:38:30]  uh if he said can i get a ride then uh he should probably fuck up i would never make him pay because  200 bucks he's got to work fucking three months to get that but i just want him to deal with the guilt  but the party was a very good party and i just wanted to thank you it was fun that was good and  patrice can uh he can cook very very well he's very good at barbecuing yeah do you believe he  actually had a couple of guinness yeah i've never seen him do that i've never seen him drink it's the 
[02:39:00]  weirdest fucking thing and then he just sat there in the chair kind of drunk it was weird to see man  yeah not as weird as when you guys all went in the pool and looking at your fucking unhealthy bodies  all it was just horrible look like a i was at a fat club camp it was at least we were in the  fucking pool fucking norton looks like a light-skinned scallop he takes his fucking shirt off that glow-in-the-dark  human all right it looked like someone threw a turkey in the 
[02:39:30]  why didn't you go in the pool because it wasn't hot in the day in the day it was hot towards the end  in the evening it keeps the pool at 93 degrees that night it's gonna feel nice and hot it was  beautiful but my idea there's jimmy in the pool oh my god jesus you can't  holy shit he's on a little floaty yeah does he have tiny little  fucking swim trunks on too yeah i think he was wearing a little of course like showing his boner 
[02:40:00]  and everything oh god damn yeah everybody had fun in the pool why you didn't come in the house was  amazing i said to anthony thank you sir you know he's fucking loves his house i said every time you  guys lost the market i was hoping a room would disappear yeah he was being a real smart ass  i'd be down in a closet right yeah i'm sitting in a closet oh fuck happen to my house  we had a tough year we had to think anytime patrice was in the room alone anthony made him clap so we 
[02:40:30]  knew he wasn't stealing anything why don't we take a break because uh we're setting up the big  competition yes i'm hungry i want to see this rich voss versus what bobo oh that's really general  knowledge oh please he's not even really yeah this is the last time i'm doing that kind of shit i'm  changing my image oh yeah really yeah okay why you think you're gonna kick his ass i'm not worried about 
[02:41:00]  him well you guys probably already gave him the answers that you forgot no no guaranteed no uh  first of all i don't change my image okay because he's fucking morons that listen think that they  you know well actually they don't try to test me in a club no no they don't that that they should  because you fucking kill people i've seen rich bring people to tears where they're actually crying  because rich just beats them up uh with words it's fucking ridiculous uh and i think i might change 
[02:41:30]  my image on stage too i really i think i might just become real clean and we're kinder gentler uh rich  boss is what we're looking at i think i have to make a whole new oh man you were like a brian  regan oh my god how great with that face i would love to see that with your hair just slick to the  side or something just doing observational humor a nice a nice part down the side you ever notice  when you lose your socks in the dryer oh no i notice when there's a large black penis headed 
[02:42:00]  towards my face that's the things i notice all right listen uh voss is going to be at poco nuts  yes this weekend still water pa poco nuts comedy.com and they're closing after this weekend rich rich  voss one word on twitter and then uh wow you're playing brother wheezes club the comedy club in  rochester new york september 10th 11th and 12th yeah that's gonna be cool i haven't been up there in  in years nine years they enjoy uh a fine comic yeah i can't wait to get a lot of crappy comics to be 
[02:42:30]  honest with you so this is a this is a biggie for that club yeah but the only thing i'm worried about  there and hopefully people show up it's the week and after labor day weekend so hopefully is there a  college up there where where kids go to college no you know what i'm saying no listen let me explain  something to you why i say that i i i know what you're saying no you don't you're an idiot no you  don't know why would you say is there a college up there where kids go to college there's pretty much 
[02:43:00]  a college everywhere no because if you're working like during a holiday weekend or after a holiday  weekend like if you're working thanksgiving yes okay you want to work in a town that there's no  college because they all come out they come home right if you're working like the weekend after  labor day you want to work in a town where there is a college because they all came back  do you understand what i'm saying they never went away it's just labor day weekend are you kidding  that's your biggest weekend everybody goes away so last summer weekend no for people well i mean 
[02:43:30]  families that take their i think i think people are heading back to college like this week yeah  i know i'm doing a show sunday at a college but we're saying families there's uh r.i.t  there's uh university of rochester there's geneseo there's a bunch uh a bunch of them great  and some good golf courses i'm fucking starving where's one of your interns all right we'll figure that  rich voss yeah i didn't uh click on that one i clicked hell fucking no i clicked because uh 
[02:44:00]  it's uh it was a baby chicks yeah it was on drudge uh the drudge report uh what it was i guess peter  put this out they had a guy in there that was uh infiltrating this chicken factory that's what you  got to call them and there were these baby chicks little baby chicks you know cheap cheap cheap the 
[02:44:30]  little yellow little baby chicks and they come by on this conveyor belt and this woman is is uh  checking them for sex you know checking them for male and female and she does it real quick she can  pick them up and then she's just you know the female she just lets them go down the conveyor belt  the males though she's throwing in this chute this like big uh opening in a like a piece of duct work  and she's just tossing them one after the other like every two seconds there's another one going  and then they go on this conveyor belt where they fall into a giant auger and are chopped up uh uh and 
[02:45:00]  ground up alive are you serious little little baby chicks how many fucking chicks are there they are  coming out of the eggs and this is where they laser their beaks off the tip of their beaks  why uh i don't know i guess so they can't pluck each other's fucking little eyeballs out right  they're gonna die anyhow so they lazy and there she is throwing them down this chute look at her  just just throwing throwing them down the chute yeah that's uh that's good and and you know where 
[02:45:30]  they end up they end up on another conveyor belt that feeds them into an auger but she's not getting  every uh mail obviously well so maybe they just don't need as many look at them look at them they're  alive just going beep beep beep and then just ground right up jesus how twisted is that i'm not a  animal rights guy i'm not either but that is fucking sick i have to add the butt i i that is  fucking gruesome because the males i guess are useless as far as uh like alien eggs and stuff yeah 
[02:46:00]  so they grind them up see look the choppy ground up fucking baby bird choppy comes out i guess they  use it for something maybe dog food i don't know i'm sure something but uh that was that was really  twisted you know what the fucked up thing is though we eat so much fucking chicken in this country  there's really is there is there a way to do this wait are these are these just new products yeah 
[02:46:30]  yeah they actually just cracked them out of the egg they they they weren't even had they're not even  doing it on the road they just break the egg and say you're trying to get out and die pretty much  just did that and the females they'll they'll let them grow but they they lose quite a few of them i  guess in the process it's like a golf ball factory i was saying it's like they might as well just be  golf balls because they don't treat them with any compassion like they're actual living creatures 
[02:47:00]  they um they just treat them as product that happens to be alive but we eat so many see that's  uh one of them that didn't get through the on the belt and went into the scalding hot water oh my god  yeah yeah it's so sad that someone's gotta clean that up it's a chicken holocaust is what i uh i i  pretty much conclude that is like auschwitz for chickens i was thinking i was thinking that but  i didn't know how to make it funny no it's something i'm not trying to make it funny obviously it's just 
[02:47:30]  uh i don't know i love chicken and then they say at the end of this they ruin it by saying if you  were horrified by this uh look up uh having a vegan diet that doesn't include it's like no i love chicken  and i don't really know of any other way to do this with at the quantity that we need chicken in  this country right to eat without it being this uh impersonal and cruel and everything else you can't you 
[02:48:00]  can't take every male little chick and i don't know put it somewhere what are you going to do with  it you're going to lull it to sleep you're going to give it an injection and nurse it until it uh dies  peacefully or you're just going to throw it into a meat grinder it's got to be a factory like this  well but wait a second oh it's got to be it's horrible it's horrible but you know can you put  them out in the wild where you're going to put those fucking male chickens you see how many there  are where you're going to put all those fucking male chickens just roam around on the rain first of 
[02:48:30]  all they're babies put them in the inner city they don't know the difference in the fresh air funds for  fucking chickens they're babies so they would die anyway out in the wild you'd have to raise them  which costs money which uh they don't want to do because they're not uh useful to them it's  fucked up i understand that much but well i mean when a male chicken grows i don't know like when i  have chicken if it's male or female but when it grows can you eat it then uh i guess certain ones if 
[02:49:00]  they're raised for food chickens but they don't raise like roosters like that roosters are just made  to feed the fucking eggs to to fertilize the eggs i guess if you need more chickens but they want  unfertilized chickens are roosters oh my dear sweet jesus are we are we in the test yet no let's bring  in bobo yeah bobo's a good segue you know what get the stupid i didn't fucking realize that roosters  are chickens after they were a whole nother out you're right yeah right the roosters it's a rooster 
[02:49:30]  it's not a chicken a chicken is a female female is a hen oh and then wow that does look like a  golf ball factory i didn't i know i didn't know what danny was doing but it looks just like the  chicken factory it sure does frightening exactly well where's that video on drudge i think it  you probably still find on drudge drudge archives i i guess has it um yeah i really didn't need to see  that one but whatever oh what is this gonna haunt you no no it won't haunt me or nothing i'll still 
[02:50:00]  eat my chicken i have a piece of chicken i had chicken for three meals yesterday three meals if  you go to google news and just put in chicks as the keyword yeah you'll find it you'll find the  video it's okay what if your filters are turned off for porno will you still get that that no you  actually might come up better if you have your filters on yeah uh before we get bobo in here for  the big competition with rich voss general knowledge history what are we doing it's a  mixed bag but a mixed bag you could be bobo right i could be probably everybody in this room except

[02:55:00]  well but i got my mother apparently thinks i'm in great danger because of the fires that are raging  in california so this is the uh the message i got from my mother uh today  hi um this is mom uh we just worried about the fires i assume you're in la uh i hope you're safe  and uh i'm just worried very good you picked this on tv with a global fire so here's a call let us know 
[02:55:30]  you're safe okay honey we come from the back here we love you talk to you soon sweetheart bye  i'm nowhere near the fire i couldn't be farther from the fires than i am right now i mean i'm more  in danger of somebody flicking a cigarette out the window and burning me but she's home panicking  thinking that her her baby boy is going to tinseltown and being burned up in the awful fires  i should call back screaming i was gonna help close my department and hang up on her 
[02:56:00]  fucking jimmy man you know what though fucking old people have nothing better it's hysterical  parents are the worst when it comes to that when i hit 60 i start my rock climbing career  really because i ain't sitting home fucking doing nothing hi that means fires they're making me  nervous they watch tv probably 12 hours a day they see the fires holy shit jimmy's in la and then  they have nothing else to do but worry about their son in la what do you think he's doing yeah hiking 
[02:56:30]  it's not in the woods i were in the uh the brush in the in the hills and fly fishing he's in a city  where there's a lot of concrete he's in a major city that won't burn from these  fucking brush fires now one of the most uh finance tv shows on the planet that i'm sure to keep them  yeah yeah i think it's you know they're not gonna let jay leno's program burn please  what what do you think she's thinking though that jimmy is is sleeping with like the the light of 
[02:57:00]  flames out his window and there's no escape and yeah he's surrounded by fire man that's just it  also proves how the news just really fucking gets people you know oh the fire is so close to downtown  los angeles like yeah go ahead try to get into just keep marching until you see the pacific ocean  you'll be fine what's up a floating ember gonna set the capital records building on fire i don't think  so i think he's okay my father got old it was depressing it was it was uh gas prices it was uh 
[02:57:30]  where to get good like fucking diner food yeah what happened what happened so you gotta take up those  crazy hobbies when you get older i've been talking about broads my mother's old she's ready to go  but here's my new bit yeah when they die when she's ready to die you could do anything you want just  go that's what they would have wanted like the day after she dies i'm going to six flags and people go  hey that's what she would have wanted she would have wanted it that way we're big fans of the 
[02:58:00]  bit that's what they wanted that's or or this is exactly how he would have wanted to go yeah  like no i don't think so yeah my my uh the first time i learned about death was my principal  at washington drive school died while scuba diving somewhere in uh wading river i believe  really to get real local right and that's what went around the school well he died doing what he  wanted really really basically i think he had a heart attack 60 70 feet in the water oops with no 
[02:58:30]  one around to help him yeah that's a that's a wonderful way to go that's what there was a  comic an open mic from l.a i don't know who it is but he said hey my brother passed away but he died  doing what he loved shooting himself in the head that's pretty good i don't know who this  fucking guy is but i always said a great line that's a funny line right line no one dies what yeah what  they love doing they love doing because it's called living because the act of dying is horrific 
[02:59:00]  you don't want to do that stage when a quarterback played i don't want to say his name played during  the game with his dad which is funeral he goes i'm going to play today that's what dad would have  wanted and you go really how come the kid from baskin robbins doesn't dad would have wanted me to  make a banana split today you know really that's what he would have wanted why don't you want to say  his name because you don't remember his name i remember his name i don't know just because he might  call in he might be one of your guests someday who was it just say it who is it oh i remember the story  but i can't remember the name he retired then he came back he retired came back who was it oh 
[02:59:30]  his father you know it is kind of a legendary story i have no idea and he he actually threw for  the most yards he's ever threw for well who is it just say it i it brett farve oh okay  damn it was it brett farve and you weren't sure if it was no i know it's brett farve  whatever the fuck his name is let's get bogone here we're gonna do 10 questions we're gonna make this  easy for you rich you versus bobo hi bobo he can't sit near me dive in what you know why don't 
[03:00:00]  you get on a fucking microphone or wait for a microphone before you start yapping can you sit  on somewhere not close to anybody um yeah it's a line i thought up what's the line time for pussy  diving is that like your catchphrase now yeah it is why is it your catchphrase i get people in my  neighborhood that recognize me oh there's like two people in my neighborhood that recognize me 
[03:00:30]  let you get on that microphone and and they and they were asking me they said hey bobo you went  pussy diving the queen's motor in ho ho  yeah there's people that have actually said that to me yeah and i think one time i walked  in new woodside coincidence not far from the queen's motor and they've mentioned that oh wow  coincidence yeah unfortunately though i couldn't find a guy in donovan's named dogshit sniffer  i have no idea what he's talking about what am i missing um yeah i think that day some someone 
[03:01:00]  called in all right yeah yeah so did you have uh did you have fun at the party bobo can i tell you  something yeah i did yeah we've probably done a hundred bits since your dumb queen's motor in thing  yeah i don't remember this what the happened at the queen's motor in i'm sorry you don't even want to  know i'm trying to change my image he's trying to yeah i'm with some girl yeah there's no way in  hell it was ever gonna happen it got very creepy um yeah uh yeah you had fun at the party yeah yeah i did  don't force you what happened was that time that i i actually forgot my bathing suit that day 
[03:01:30]  because i rushed because the long on railroad takes forever at this at that certain time of  day so that you don't have to rush yeah it's so interesting you're lying now i was trying to get  that train because i knew the next one i'd be waiting like three hours whatever so what happened  what are you talking about that's why you were in the pool naked you went at his house and actually  originally i originally i just went i just went in the pool with my tighty whiteys but danny thought  it'd be funny to cut off the tighty whiteys i was originally gonna go in the pool with the tighty 
[03:02:00]  whiteys and just and just go commando on the way home and then he's and then he's standing in the  hot tub with jimmy and his chick and and just being horrific horrifically naked and then and then for  some reason jimmy decided he thought it'd be a great opportunity to play that up and down game  again  jimmy jimmy was in the hot tub with his with his chick and uh i just kept saying to bobo bo what are they 
[03:02:30]  doing and they kept like bobo uh jim and his chick were making out i just kept going bo what are they  doing what are they doing what are they doing he kept trying to look away bobo keep looking keep  looking and then bobo stand up and of course he had a big rager yeah bobo well big well  a little rager hold on linda is kind of mad at us because of uh the jimmy parent thing jimmy's  parents oh linda hi guys hi what's up nothing i just well why are you sitting on jimmy's parents  for calling in and checking on them well because it's stupid it's stupid worrying i mean i don't know 
[03:03:00]  their story is jimmy an only child i don't know no it's just um jimmy's uh correct to beat up his  parents over there that's silly if you look at a map look or look at the news and see where the  fires are you realize la isn't burning you know and not many i mean not many people are dying i  mean it's sad that we did lose a few people and sucks for those families but i mean here's the  scenario jimmy's out in la uh and just uh over the top earthquake happens at that point you call 
[03:03:30]  jimmy and go wow are you all right because he said there's no point calling huh if he died there's  no point calling but well just to make sure he's okay if it's an earthquake or something but fires i  mean he's not hiking anywhere near the he's not doing anything near the fire he's not firefighting  i'm telling you i got a 21 year old kid and i already starting that crap like he's going around  the corner did you put your seatbelt on did you do this did you do that but i wonder if they if they 
[03:04:00]  didn't call him would he care that his parents don't care i don't know you don't care i have a  19 year old i have one question for her is he white that's pretty much it you're bad i guess i  don't all right i guess we don't know what it's like to be a parent i don't know maybe the worrying  never never ends all right why don't we do this bobo it's you versus rich voss we want you guys to  write down the answers to the questions danny's gonna read the questions whatever it's gonna be 
[03:04:30]  you want to do that danny and you guys write the answer down and we'll see who um gets the most  right correct does he have to stand right behind me isn't there another place where can you nothing  personal it's just i i'm claustrophobic can he go maybe a little bit over there or something or  really does that really bother you is somebody leaning right behind you then we'll keep that's  breathing yeah but how is he gonna write anyway yeah he can't write just standing up he could write on  rich is back okay okay hey by the way it looks like murray's hitting hitting up your alley 
[03:05:00]  what what they're talking about on today's show younger older relationships they're hitting your  alley oh i see  thanks bobo for that you're welcome you ready to play yep you think you could beat rich voss  yeah you're gonna have him sit down over there okay all right write down your answers don't uh  say your answers until we ask for them and then uh and we'll see who's smarter here 
[03:05:30]  spelling doesn't count do you have no no no no points off for misspelling of words  does bobo have anything to write with i believe uh the lovely danny is getting our supplies oh we don't  have um the papers stationary here we don't have stationary we have a lot of people that are  stationary i noticed interns and whatnot oh yeah but stop all right blow blow you got that yeah i got it 
[03:06:00]  got it all right rich got his pen and paper ask him about his brother oh my god who's brother his  yeah yeah he either that he either blew his brother or that brother blew him that that never  happened wow that never happened as a matter of fact you're lying i don't know as a matter of fact  i didn't eat rich he's lying if i would have realized you were in california i would have had  you act he's lying rich i would have given you ob my brother's address and you could have found out  the truth directly from him i would think he'd done it his brother because look at those lips man he's 
[03:06:30]  lying i'm not lying how can you lay in the room i'm not lawyer he's lying i'm not lying  lying no i'm not lying you are lying you are lying i'm not lying i understand you you want some  pussy now but you you're lying you are lying no i'm not lying how old is your brother older or younger  he's older he's older that's how he was able to overpower um bobo and have sex with him yeah that  you're lying that never happened you're lying no it never that never happened liar liar that never 
[03:07:00]  happened you're you're lying no i'm not lying it doesn't make you a bad person it's not your  fault yeah it isn't your fault doesn't make you a bad person it's your fault if you swallow because  that means you're enjoying it this is one of the best ones yet i hate this character bring back anyone  else ah that's funny all right why don't we get into the uh the contest here danny you ready for  the first question sure all right let's do it come on rich i'm counting on you oh let's do i'll pay for 
[03:07:30]  your uh next golf round if you beat bobo oh all right all right let's have a beach i don't care and i'll  make the sandwiches let's do uh let's name the presidents backwards from obama let's do like the  last eight presidents we'll see or no go go as far as you can yeah right down from obama backwards the  presidents okay they're starting to write rich boss uh is uh cranking away there he's got two 
[03:08:00]  bobo's going pretty well as well bobo is right but bobo's probably drawing pictures of dicks  bobo's pad looks like super bad yeah it is caught pictures rich boss uh is counting  just tell us when you're done when you just don't know any more presidents going backwards  all right i see uh boss 
[03:08:30]  bobo's having a tough time  like five times  oh boy oh wow that is weakness he can't write he can't write no oh bobo's illiterate 
[03:09:00]  oh no what he wrote he's still on number two he wrote obama three times  wait could could someone could he someone write for him he's starting to write his list  and then if he spells something wrong he crosses out the entire list and then has to write the  list over again  well how are we gonna do this he doesn't know how to write 
[03:09:30]  sam how's he doing over there okay um he's starting his fourth list  he can't write and this is a tough question to start with because there's a lot of writing yes  it's not just a one-word answer yeah the rest of them will pretty much be one-word answers yeah  hold on rich is still working on his list how's bobo doing somewhat panicking rich is uh panicking  a little bit no he's he's redoing certain things i see something's crossed out 
[03:10:00]  bobo's picking his nose and writing and he's more successful at picking his nose another cross out  oh boy but at least he didn't do the whole list over again oh yeah wow i think this and  twice is probably the song twice yeah somebody might three times yeah somebody might want to read  for bobo too just to make sure yeah 
[03:10:30]  is he continuing his list he is continuing his list okay um some things are spelled phonetically  so that's that's okay that's fine that's enough for now one two three four five how about we do  this you're done with your list rich yeah yeah yeah you want bobo to do i think i've gone as far  back as i can let him do his verbally i can remember all right all right we're gonna start  with bobo you do yours verbally all right i'll go you don't have to read your list just go back  verbally if you all right go ahead who's gonna keep track of this all right bobo just start going 
[03:11:00]  back go back all right i'll go uh obama right bush jr clinton bush senior reagan  carter ford nixon johnson kennedy and eisenhower that is correct is that it and that's so he got 
[03:11:30]  back to ike he got 11 he got back to ike is that it bobo yeah he got 11 i don't remember  i don't remember what was between i think i thought that'd be ford and carter that would be  harry truman yeah oh wait let rich uh read his last stand please oh uh please yeah no no i  just don't want him to correct shit i'm not i'm not gonna cheat all right you gotta you gotta  beat 11 yeah so obama bush bush that's three because he had two terms well we're not going

[03:32:30]  bush jr is of course b-r-u-s-h jr  which of course is the same as bush senior b-r-u-s-h right brush senior uh reagan  of course is i'm assuming that's a g but it appears to be r-a-z-e-n 
[03:33:00]  his excuse is he was writing it quick i'm ronald reagan carter of course c-r-a-r-t-e-r  he's he's anti-chinescent he throws an r  johnson of course johnson is spelt correctly which is j-o-n-d-o-n  And Jondon.  That's right, Jondon. 
[03:33:30]  Jondon.  He made up for that with Kennedy, of course.  K-E-N-I-D-E-Y.  E-Y.  And we round the list off with Eisenhower.  Oh, no.  Which is I-R-D-I-N-H-O-W-E-R. 
[03:34:00]  Eisenhower.  Eisenhower.  And those are Bobo's answers.  All right.  Wow.  And you lost that, Rich.  He did not get one right.  And you lost to that.  You lost to that.  No, we have another question.  No, there isn't another question.  We don't have another question, though.  That's it.  Do we have another question?  We can get one.  Or you can double down.  Because he actually, and I do want to think, I do want him to win.  Because, you know, in life, that'll make, maybe help his self-esteem. 
[03:34:30]  But he did say the Korea War when it was the Korean War.  He said the Korean War.  No, he said the Korea War.  He said the Korea War.  The Korea War.  The Korea.  He said the Korea War, which is not, would have been the wrong answer on television.  But he answered the Korean War first, I believe.  No, he said the Korea War.  Go back to the tapes.  But I'm not going on technicalities because.  Yeah.  Let me go to Dana in Boston.  Dana.  Doug, good morning.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to find out when boss is going to be back for the next installment of Miserable Pursuit. 
[03:35:00]  What do you call it?  Miserable Pursuit.  Let's go to Tim in Rhode Island.  Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Tim?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  You're on the air, you know.  Oh, I'm on the air right now?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Hey, I was just wondering if Bobo could do some impressions of Patrick Kennedy because I'm  listening for one of the first times this week.  I think he sounds exactly like him.  He sounds a little like Patrick Kennedy said during the eulogy. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you give him some ammo?  Have him talk about his father's moles or something?  Yeah, we'll give him a little something there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We got another question, Danny.  Uh, yeah, hang on.  I might concede.  This is boring me.  Oh, well.  Oh, really?  No.  It's knowledge.  It probably is boring.  Bobo, you're not trash talking anymore.  Well, I do got to say that I think I got more laughs at the stress factory that night 
[03:36:00]  than you did.  Let's go over the tapes.  You did well.  I was very impressed.  Yeah, you did very well.  I was very happy that you could show up.  Thank you.  You're welcome, boss.  You can't trash talk and then say you're welcome.  But you did very well, and I was very pleased, and I would love to have you at any show I'm  going on, because I know how, with your drawing power, uh, did your family have to pay that  night? 
[03:36:30]  No, no, no, I don't, I don't think so.  Good, because they shouldn't have had to.  Mm.  You deserve, uh, uh, four-star treatment to come all the way up from Queens to do that.  I was very impressed.  See?  I don't have to attack that.  And he just goes, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  So thank you.  Anytime you're, uh, available.  All right, should we do one more question as a goof?  Sure.  Yeah.  All right, this is it, no matter what.  Sure, no problem.  One more question.  I'd like to see what, I'd like to kick Mr. Ed's ass some more. 
[03:37:00]  That was very nice.  You got me on that one.  You know what?  You are absolutely right.  When you call me Mr. Ed, it just, it makes me look, maybe I should have my teeth filed  down.  Thank you for, uh, pointing that out.  I'm going to go, you know what, thank you, because I think my teeth are a little too big  for, for me, and I, and you know what?  Oh.  I've been in denial about this for years, and with your help right now, I'm going to go  get them fixed.  Thank you.  Wow, Bubba.  Thanks.  All right, good, good luck with that one, because my mother complains about her health coverage, 
[03:37:30]  not covering dental.  You know what?  Apparently it doesn't cover mentally.  You know what?  If there's any way I can help your mom out, I will.  Well, she does say she needs, she needed her teeth fixed.  No, by pushing you in front of a bus.  Very funny bus.  No, but thank you for pointing out the teeth thing.  Yeah.  That was nice.  Yeah.  You're kind.  He's a, I don't know why people say mean things.  He's, he's a kind guy. 
[03:38:00]  One more question.  Danny's got it.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Ooh.  What is the largest planet in the solar system?  The largest planet in the solar system.  Here we go.  Bobo is making a face like he's smelling some, some dog shit.  He's a little confused.  Rich Voss, not even writing it down?  I'm thinking.  Oh.  Okay. 
[03:38:30]  All right.  I'm going to have to go with, uh.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Do you have an answer, Bobo?  Yeah.  You're good?  Okay.  Hang on.  Hold on.  Whoever you guys want to be.  All right.  You both have answers?  Rich didn't write anything down, so he's going to do it.  Rich, uh, I think, hold on, hold on, hold on, Bobo.  You could shut the fuck up, Bobo, right now, okay?  All right.  All right.  Mercury.  Mercury.  Wow.  Mercury.  I don't know.  I just felt like saying Mercury.  I felt like a nice word to say at this point.  Mercury, uh, would be incorrect. 
[03:39:00]  Mercury, as a matter of fact, one of the smaller planets.  I know, I know, but it has, it has a lot of heart.  I believe.  Same with Mars and Pluto.  A lot of heart for these kids.  Yeah, yeah, and I think there's a, I, I, and I think also that planet's got a lot  of cum.  What?  No, no, I was making a joke.  It was a pretty Mercury joke.  All right.  What the fuck?  For the record, Pluto is no longer a planet. 
[03:39:30]  Yes, yes.  See, they kind of threw Pluto out, so Mercury could be the smallest planet.  I, I guessed Mars.  Oh, we're both wrong.  Well, Bobo was closer.  Yes.  You're a little closer.  It's Saturn.  You think it's Saturn?  No, I think it's the sun.  No, the sun's not a planet.  I know, I just want to see if you knew that answer.  I got a few left.  Uh, I would have to go with Uranus.  No.  No.  No, not at all.  No.  I'm not going to say you got another guess.  I'm going to guess, uh, Neptune. 
[03:40:00]  No.  No.  No.  I didn't say you had a good basketball game.  I think I'll guess, uh, I'll guess, uh, Venus.  No.  Wow.  Venus.  Let's see.  No, it doesn't matter how many times you say it.  Let's see.  Let me guess.  Wow.  They pretty much say them all.  How many plans?  I think you got one left.  You got one more.  Whoever says it first.  Whoever says it first wins.  Whoever says it first wins.  Uh, let's see.  Let's see.  You got one left.  Mars, Neptune, Mars, Neptune, Mercury, Uranus, Saturn. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  Holy shit.  This is tragic.  Did I guess Venus already?  Yeah.  Seven times.  Yeah, I guess Venus.  Let's see.  More.  More.  More.  This is tragic.  Mars, uh, I can't remember.  What?  It's the only planet.  The only one left.  That's the last.  Oh, Earth.  Earth.  No, it's not Earth.  Well, there's another one left.  There's another one.  The largest planet in the solar system. 
[03:41:00]  The moon.  No, that's not a planet.  The moon.  Holy shit.  Oh, wait, man.  I'm going to guess Jupiter.  Yay!  It is Jupiter.  Bobo takes it away.  It's Jupiter.  Jupiter.  Six to four.  Bobo wins.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Oh.  The only planet left.  How did you miss Jupiter?  Because it's an anti-Semitic planet.  Yes.  Rich Voss. 
[03:41:30]  That's how Bobo spelt it.  J-E-W.  Pitter.  Pitter.  You did a great job.  Yeah.  Wow, Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Just fantastic.  When will you be appearing at the train platform again?  Are you talking about when he'll be appearing at a show again?  Oh, shit.  He's implying you do shows on the train platform.  Wow.  Damn, Bobo.  Good one, Bobo.  You can't give him his fucking smashes.  Oh, he didn't mean that?  Remember when he was going to the Mets game? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, I remember.  It was a callback.  But I was hoping he was smashing you.  You can't smash me.  He wasn't, so I gave him an assist.  You can't smash a guy that agrees with everything he says.  Okay, well, he's smarter than you, so.  Yeah, let's get the plugs and get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, let's do that.  You guys are leaving already?  Yeah, we leave already.  We've done some overtime today.  We did our time.  I fucking love this now.  Rich Voss is at Poco Nuts.  Poco Nuts.  Poco Nuts.  Still Water PA. 
[03:42:30]  Poconutscomedy.com.  That's September 4th and 5th, so what?  Thursday and Friday.  Friday, Saturday.  Friday, Saturday.  Okay.  But how about the Rochester's a big one?  Yeah, I think it is.  Well, Weez is going to fucking sell that out for you, but the Comedy Club in Rochester,  New York, September 10th, 11th, and 12th.  That's big.  Yeah, it's going to be fun, man.  That's big.  Because Weez has been trying to get some of our comedy friends.  Oh, wait a minute.  I got a little plug.  I might be stopping by FH to pick up a cheesecake because my sister's birthday is coming up on  Monday. 
[03:43:00]  You're going to go all the way out to FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington  Village, to get a cheesecake for your sister's birthday.  Cheesecake.  She said she wanted an Oreo cheesecake after I described how good the cheesecake was.  She said, get one for my birthday, she said.  All right, go get one.  And here's another real quick one.  If you're in the Chicago area, what's his name?  Has the best cupcakes, this guy.  I forget the name of it.  Oh, it's the one that has the Ron and Fezza?  Yeah, when I was in Chicago. 
[03:43:30]  I think you're talking about Molly's Cupcakes.  Oh, damn, Molly's Cupcakes.  Oh, seven to four.  Oh, my God.  Molly's kicking ass.  Yes.  Jesus, right?  Molly's Cupcakes.  How could I not know that one?  My aunt just came in a few weeks ago, and she was in Chicago not long ago, brought me a few  of them from that place.  I told her about that place.  Bring back some.  Next time you head into New York, bring back some. 
[03:44:00]  Rich, he's never been there.  You've been there, but he knows the name and you don't.  And I've had the cupcakes from there.  How come he has a story for every answer?  He does.  He really has a story.  If you remember, that's kind of how, in Slumdog Millionaire, how that kid was able to answer  it was through actual experiences.  That's exactly what Bobo was.  It was based on his life.  Dumbdog Millionaire.  That's fucking classic.  You went in orange juice today.  All right. 
[03:44:30]  Thanks, boss.  Another thing I meant to tell you, guys, a crazy occurrence happened to me earlier this  week.  What happened?  Well, two worse things.  A man came up to me and said, I haven't had a bike in three weeks.  Two worse things happened.  Shut up.  It's all a hack joke.  Two worse things happened.  My speakers went down.  Yeah, we know that.  During the time I couldn't listen to the show, my speakers went down.  And when my uncle walked out in the back.  Like you and your brother?  No, no.  Going down? 
[03:45:00]  No.  No, the speakers don't work.  The speakers don't work.  The speakers I used for my XM radio and for my iPhone.  So how is it a wacky story?  No, but what happened after that, I ran the same, almost shortly after, my uncle walked  out of the bathroom and there was a flood in the bathroom.  And I found myself cleaning up that flood.  What?  I found myself cleaning up a flood that wound up all the way into the kitchen. 
[03:45:30]  Next time you clean up a flood, try to fix your speakers at the same time.  Now all the speakers was in a separate room.  All right.  Now it's another problem.  Bobo.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  He is a gem.  I don't even give a flying fuck if anybody doesn't like him.  I don't understand why we have so many listeners that don't understand humor and sarcasm.  But they're like hardcore fans of the show.  Yeah.  You get Patty in here.  She doesn't even know when we're telling a joke or being sarcastic. 
[03:46:00]  Same with this Bobo guy.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  What are you doing with those binoculars?  These are given to me.  So what are you going to do with them?  Hey, use them whenever I use binoculars.  When do you use binoculars?  What would you need binoculars for?  She was living in the hair on his leg.  Anytime I'm somewhere that...  Well, I don't know how much I have used for binoculars now because the new stadiums, 
[03:46:30]  those seats all the way to the upper tank are still a lot closer and the upper tank at the old stadium.  But I remember they used to be so high.  So you're talking about when you go to see the Mets, you might use the binoculars to see the field a little better.  The seats are pretty good.  Yeah, but the seats are so good that I might not be using them that much.  Do you have any neighbors with windows that you might want to look in?  Well, I haven't figured out all the neighbors if there's any hot chicks.  But unfortunately, they don't live somewhere near any of the windows that I can look at.  You've checked. 
[03:47:00]  I've checked.  I just know one thing.  That dog, my sister's dog, that dog is...  Love's peanut butter.  No, that dog is a real chick magnet.  Oh, yeah?  I swear, I get so many chicks, they say, oh, they want to pet the dog.  And for some reason, there's something...  There's something about that dog that just attracts people that they just woke up to.  I mean, they ask, oh, can I pet the dog?  I don't know if they're trying to really hit on me or they just want to pet the dog. 
[03:47:30]  On and on, doesn't he?  The why the heck I need Windex.  I got plenty of Windex at home.  All right.  All right.  All right.  How come him and Patty don't go out?  Oh, shit.  They really should.  You wouldn't bang Patty, right, Bobo?  If I was dead drunk, how would we tell the difference?  Why wouldn't you bang her?  No, you wouldn't know I was dead drunk.  Someone would bring in a breathalyzer and know I was dead drunk.  I don't even remember it.  Did I bang? 
[03:48:00]  What's the problem with Patty?  Yeah, why wouldn't you have sex with her?  You're both virgins.  Oh, let's just say she's probably all dried up, probably all shriveled up.  What if we put a mask on her face that looks like your brother?  No, that would just be even more irritating.  He turns into Morse code.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  That would be more irritating.  You're lying.  I would literally have to be dead drunk and blindfolded. 
[03:48:30]  He's not a virgin.  He's gotten laid, hasn't he?  No.  With a hooker?  You're kidding.  Never had a hooker?  No.  No, never even got laid.  One of these weekends, I need to go to head out to Vegas, maybe.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  How old are you?  27.  Why don't you get him laid?  He just beat me.  His prize should be getting laid.  Can you do that off the air?  We've tried.  Wait, can we give him a D.L. Hughley?  I mean, D.L. Hughley paid for Yankee Cranky for intern David. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, I mean, he's not an intern.  We can give him whatever we want.  Oh, shit.  I say we can get the guys fucking laid already, man.  All right, we'll figure something out.  We've got to go.  Rich, thank you.  Yeah, it's got to happen sometime around over the course of the Labor Day weekend.  He wants to, like, now.  It's got to happen, like, the next 48 hours.  Jesus.  Rich Voss, one word on Twitter as well.  Is it?  Wait.  You don't know that?  You don't even know that?  No, I've been tweeting, though. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, you certainly have.  Time for pussy diving.  Oh, his catchphrase.  I feel dumber.  I really do, though.  I actually feel dumber.  Is it just sucking any IQ out of this room?  I'm going to go to your driving range, I think.  Yeah, good for you.  I got a new friend.  I got to practice fly fishing.  I'm going to go to your maybe do that.  Yeah, the fly fishing range.  Where the fuck do you go to?  I was going to use them.  All right.  What are you doing, Sam?  Well, I was taking back the binoculars. 
[03:50:00]  You can't actually keep them.  Why?  They're outdoors.  We don't have any windows to look out of anymore.  Sam was just flustering him by giving him things to hold as he's trying to talk.  And so we bought my kid little toy binoculars and take it away.  She cries.  And I just thought that was going to happen.  Yeah, he's looking very sad.  He likes those binoculars, don't you?  That's no big deal.  But I think that was given to me.  That was given to me.  The harness shoes I gave it to you for women.  Yeah, that was given to me.  Sam's trying to take away the harness shoes.  And he's like, that was given to me. 
[03:50:30]  That was given to me.  That was.  That was.  That was.  That wasn't.  You're lying.  No, I'm not lying.  You're lying.  You just took that from a boss.  You're lying.  No, I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Bobo, did you really mean you were going to really have sex with Bonnie today at a hotel?  Because I'm very upset about that.  No, that was actually just part of the goof, that line.  Okay, because I got scared.  That wasn't actually going to happen.  I was just going to use that as part of my punches I was going to throw as I got the questions right. 
[03:51:00]  Okay.  I had a couple of ones that I just came up with for this.  Okay.  Thank you.  Did you use all your lines that you came up with?  Yeah, those were lines I came up with.  No, did you use them all?  Or do you have a couple more?  Your lines?  No, I think those are all of them.  All right, yeah.  All right, we're going to go, guys.  All right, let's get out of here.  Patrice O'Neill will be here tomorrow.  Thank you, Rich.  It was great.  Rich did a great job today.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
