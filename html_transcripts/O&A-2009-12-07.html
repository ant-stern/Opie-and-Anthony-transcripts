<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The December 7th, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show opened with characteristically crude sexual humor and boasts about the show's controversial nature.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of Pearl Harbor, employing offensive and outdated terminology regarding Japanese people, followed by a debate on the appropriateness of their language.  A major segment focused on a scathing review of Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory show, highlighting its perceived poor production quality, including noticeable editing errors and what the hosts believed to be staged scenes.  They extensively speculated on the show's fakery and the potential involvement of lawyers.

The show then transitioned to a deep dive into "junk TV," primarily focusing on MTV's *Jersey Shore*. The hosts described the show's cast of "guidos" and "guidettes" from the tri-state area, detailing their stereotypical behavior, heavy drinking, fighting, and excessive hair gel usage.  Numerous clips were played, showcasing the personalities of Snooki (including a clip of her being knocked unconscious), Pauly D, The Situation, and JWoww, emphasizing their outrageous behavior and language.  The potential for lawsuits and the show's surprising popularity were discussed at length.  This *Jersey Shore* segment continued later in the broadcast, with further analysis of the cast's behavior and speculation about the show's future, including potential spin-offs.  More clips and commentary on a *Jersey Shore* episode punctuated this extended discussion.

The show also included a segment on the Biography Channel's *I Survived* series, detailing graphic accounts of violent crimes, including rape and dismemberment, and the seemingly lenient sentences given to the perpetrators.  A caller shared a personal connection to one of the cases.

Another significant portion addressed the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal.  The hosts excitedly recounted the growing list of alleged mistresses, using vulgar language and making numerous jokes about Woods' sexual behavior and the women involved.  Specific details of the alleged affairs were discussed, along with speculation on Woods' future sponsorships and public image.  A caller shared a joke about Woods' alleged sexual preferences.  The hosts also discussed the controversial Golf Digest cover featuring Obama and Woods, given the timing of the scandal.  Multiple callers weighed in on *Jersey Shore*, "Guido" culture, and the Tiger Woods situation.  A humorous bit about Italian storm chasers was also included in this section.

The show also covered the then-recent Saturday Night Live skit depicting a domestic violence scenario involving a Tiger Woods parody, along with the ensuing controversy.  The hosts also discussed Michael Vick's return to professional football after his dog fighting conviction, contrasting public reactions to his comeback with the continued negative sentiment surrounding Tiger Woods. Sharon Osbourne briefly called into the show.  A significant portion dealt with the aftermath of a heated on-air confrontation between Jesse Ventura and Jim Norton, with the hosts criticizing Baltimore Sun blogger Kevin Eck and CNN's Rick Sanchez for their perceived biased reporting on the incident.  They cited their own audio recordings contradicting the published accounts.  A video of a football player suffering a severe leg injury was also mentioned.  Further details regarding an alleged past DUI incident involving Rick Sanchez were also shared.

A later segment included a discussion about "Ronnie" and "The Situation" (apparently from a reality show),  the death of professional wrestler Umaga and his relationship with The Rock, and another wrestler referred to as "Mr. Ass."  This transitioned into more speculation on the Tiger Woods scandal, including his future media appearances and his wife's potential reaction.  Caller Cody shared his experiences at sex addiction meetings, prompting a discussion on sex addiction.  The show also discussed Hulk Hogan's divorce and appearance on Joe Rogan's show, with the hosts criticizing Hogan.  The segment concluded with two 911 calls: one about a woman shooting an intruder and another about a man shooting his wife.  Andy Levy from Red Eye was a guest during a portion of this segment, contributing to the discussions on Tiger Woods and the 911 calls.  A "12 Days of Guido" Christmas song was played.

Another segment began with a discussion about D-Boyâ€™s theory that Lionsgate releases many initially promising but ultimately disappointing films.  This led to a digression involving Andy Levy and his admired on-air bits.  The hosts then discussed Greg Gutfeld's upcoming book and his supposed marmalade obsession, followed by criticism of blogger Kevin Eck.  A lengthy and vulgar discussion of Alexa Ray Joel's alleged suicide attempt ensued, focusing on her appearance and the pressures of having famous parents.  A caller defended Joel's attractiveness, and she briefly appeared in-studio for a performance of her song "Invisible," with the hosts debating whether she lip-synced.  The show concluded with discussion of Madonna's new music video, promotional announcements for upcoming appearances by Andy Levy and Jim Florentine, and a final recap of attempts to contact Kevin Eck and disparagement of critical bloggers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horse shit.  This show is never short of death.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  Hi.  It's Monday.  Hey, everybody.  December 7th.  2009.  December 7th.  A day which we're living in for me.  That was a few years ago, huh?  Japs blindsided us.  Pearl Harbor.  You can't say Japs.  You can't on December 7th, you can't.  You can't say Japs because the Japs will get offended. 
[00:01:30]  I think you can on December 7th.  That's one day a year you can say it because that's what everybody said then.  What about the G word?  Can you say that on December 7th?  What?  Jerry's?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, no, no.  I don't think they came out until maybe Korea.  Oh, really?  Oh, Vietnam, yeah.  That was the war of the...  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't come out with that.  It was just Japs.  How was everyone's weekend?  Good.  Very good. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  Very good.  Fun.  Did a little acoustic singing gig with Bro Joe up there in Connecticut.  Really?  Had fun doing that.  I haven't done that in a long time, so I figured that was fun.  And then caught up on a lot of television.  Um, the Jesse Ventura thing just continues with that stupid show of his, because I finally  caught the whole thing.  Conspiracy.  I had seen...  What's it called?  True conspiracy theory.  Conspiracy theory. 
[00:02:30]  Conspiracy theory, right.  And, uh, it was the one on that big radio installation in...  Harp.  Alaska.  Harp again.  The mind control.  Mind control.  This show is so fake.  Not even, like, just fake that Jesse's going around trying to make something of nothing.  Oh, I forgot to turn off my ringer.  Um, it's just fake, like, they add in fake things.  Like, they had him at the gate of this installation trying to get in, and they had a security guy 
[00:03:00]  there with his face digitized out.  Obviously some type of an actor.  Sure.  And then it's like...  And then, uh, the cameras went crazy.  Like, they zeroed the beam in on the camera.  And you could tell it was like...  It was a special effect done to make it look staticky.  Meanwhile, digital cameras don't get staticky like that.  Right.  And it got all staticky.  And he...  Ew!  Oh, dude, it was so incredibly bad.  Ah. 
[00:03:30]  So incredibly bad.  And then he meets with all of his investigators in the war room.  He's got a team of investigators?  Yes, a team of investigators.  And they tell him who they've spoken to and what they've said.  And he's like, all right, well, I guess then we're going to have to go to Alaska.  And they show a helicopter take off and then land, and he's at the place.  And then, meanwhile, they show the helicopter land the same place it took off from.  Like, it's just done...  There's so many bad edits and cuts. 
[00:04:00]  So they weren't even smart enough to land the helicopter a little differently.  Ten feet away.  Ten feet away.  Yeah, if you turn the camera 180 degrees, you'll get a much better shot.  It's so phony.  And his experts that he's talking to aren't...  I think they're actors, too.  All the reality shows.  It's so disappointing.  And, you know, I blame the lawyers.  I just think that lawyers got involved, and you can't do this because a lawsuit will happen here.  You can't do that because of another lawsuit. 
[00:04:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So I bet you we go back to sitcoms.  Yeah.  Because I think the public is going to be aware that these reality shows are so fake.  Yeah, the reality shows are probably so much cheaper, dude.  We don't pay residuals, so much cheaper.  Yeah, but if they keep doing this fake shit, you know, who's going to watch?  And then the ratings are down, and then what are they going to do?  It doesn't matter if they're cheap anymore.  I absolutely think a lot of these experts that they have or these people that are talking...  And then at one point, he was talking to this private investigator, this woman, but she didn't want her face shown. 
[00:05:00]  So she's holding an umbrella sideways, and Jesse goes, okay, what do you got for me?  Like, it's supposed to look like this whole clandestine thing.  And then he had to bring up that he's a Navy SEAL three times during the course of the show.  We get it.  He's like, it's a military installation.  He goes, run by, you know, the Navy, and they wouldn't let a former Navy SEAL in?  Why would they?  No, why would they?  It's a fucking secure installation. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, you can't just walk around willy-nilly.  Well, I was a Navy SEAL.  He just kept bringing it up.  All right, enough about the Navy SEAL.  I cannot look at this guy.  And then someone said, well, technically it was UDT then.  Yeah, exactly.  Before the merger.  Shut up.  Well, fuck.  I'm going to watch this damn show.  I didn't see any of that.  I saw, like, the last 15 minutes.  I actually liked the last 15 minutes, but I didn't see any of that stuff leading up to it.  But that other thing he did where he went and spoke to that guy, and supposedly this...  What's it called? 
[00:06:00]  Harp.  Harp.  This harp thing.  You're supposed to be able to do some mind control by putting this electronic impulse into people's heads.  Sure.  That's the same wavelength as your brain, blah, blah.  Yeah, he told us about the harp.  Yeah, of course.  So they hook him up to what amounts to a disc man and some other little contraption that came out of the disc man  to two things that looked like little headphones that he pressed up against his jawbone  and plugged his ears, and he could hear the music still. 
[00:06:30]  Of course.  It's bone transfer.  It's acoustics.  It has nothing to do with radio transmission.  Hold on.  It's sound.  When he was here, I told him, isn't it true that some people could hear the radio when they get some dentistry done?  But even that is different.  Why is that different?  Because that's even picking up on radio waves, and I've heard that's rumor.  I heard that's like an urban legend.  But he was touching what amounts to speakers in some way, shape, or form to his jawbone, 
[00:07:00]  and then it resonates through your bones.  It cuts out the need for sound to travel into your ear, but it's still resonating in your head.  Can I tell you a brilliant point that somebody brought up to me, and I didn't think of it.  It was so obvious, it didn't occur to me, that some listener sent me, and they go,  if what he's saying is right, if 9-11 conspiracy had something to do with the government,  and all this government stuff, and the government's doing this, and they're so powerful, 
[00:07:30]  why are they allowing him to do a show on regular television about it?  Exactly.  How is he getting away with doing a TV program?  Yeah.  Someone could get thermite paint into the towers, and they could cover all this up.  Cover it all up.  But yet they can't get to the advertisers to say, don't advertise on this show.  They go like, oh my God, I can't believe it.  He was a governor, and now he's a kook. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  He's doing the show, and we're in trouble now.  Jesse Ventura's doing the show, and we can't stop him.  We brought down the towers.  We have this harp thing.  We could do mind control on him.  We choose not to.  Exactly.  They can make him listen to a certain song.  Why can't they just make him not want to do the show?  Yes.  I won't do it.  Absolutely amazing.  A hunk of crap.  Well, speaking of, I call it junk TV.  I was calling it junk TV over the weekend.  A bunch of people turned me on to the Jersey Shore. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, you've been watching that one?  I haven't seen that yet.  I said, there was such a buzz happening with people around me.  I'm like, all right, fuck it.  I'm going to check out this Jersey Shore.  It's the greatest fucking show on TV.  Yeah, it's all about guidos and guidettes.  You haven't watched the Jersey Shore yet?  A bunch of ginzaloons.  No, I haven't watched that yet.  Well, Sam is getting a few clips together.  We'll have it for the next break.  So maybe I'll wait until we get the clips because you haven't really seen the show yet. 
[00:09:00]  It's just amazing, though.  They got guidos and guidettes from pretty much the tri-state area all the way up to Poughkeepsie,  Staten Island, the Bronx, Brooklyn.  Yay, Brooklyn.  They pretty much got one from each area.  You can just see from the picture.  And then they throw them down to the Jersey Shore to live in a house together.  It's kind of like a real-world situation.  Real-world with the guineas.  But it's with guidos and guidettes.  Should it be watched?  Do you think?  Is it weird to see a summer show during the winter?  This thing is unbelievable. 
[00:09:30]  Wait till you meet Snooki.  I think she calls herself that Snooki.  The princess of Poughkeepsie.  Oh, that's what you want to be.  The princess of Poughkeepsie.  And all the guidos talk about their gel and all the shit they do.  Pauly D.  Yeah, Pauly D.  There's one guy called The Situation, and he talks in the third person.  The Situation says.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't watch a full show, but there's some pretty decently lengthy clips on YouTube.  And I just couldn't believe.  There's one guy.  He's like, oh, they show them all packing to go to this Jersey Shore house. 
[00:10:00]  And this guy must have had about 15 bottles of gel.  He's like, God, I can't go anywhere without my gel.  It's gel.  And it's not the tri-state area.  It's like, I mean, because one guy's from Rhode Island.  One guy's from Poughkeepsie.  Well, the girl's from Poughkeepsie, Staten Island, the Bronx.  And they're tanning.  They're gelling.  And looking like the typical Guido, to be honest with you.  And then they go down the Jersey Shore, and it's nothing but drinking and fighting and drama.  And the situation, talking about himself. 
[00:10:30]  That is retarded.  And I've been out of, like, real-world type of shows on MTV for many years now.  But this thing brought me right back in.  It's gelled up there.  Wait till you hear some of these clips.  Look at all this gel.  Wait till you hear some of these clips in about 20 minutes.  Yeah.  Highly recommend the Jersey Shore, as far as junk TV goes.  Oh, look at this piece of trash.  And then you've got JWoww, who has ridiculous, like, breast implants. 
[00:11:00]  And pretty much goes out with a little more than the nipple covered up.  That's it, huh?  That's just about it.  That's there in the green, I guess.  Yeah, in the background there.  Oh, she's a good dancer, though.  Oh, God.  She's good.  Snooki, huh?  Snooki rolls.  She gets...  And then, look how short Snooki is.  They did a two-hour...  The first show was two hours long, whatever.  And then they did previews for the whole season.  And the last clip, they show Snooki getting knocked the fuck out.  Really?  So I want to know what that's about. 
[00:11:30]  Some guy.  Some guy just fucking hits her, and she goes down.  And I'm thinking to myself, wow, MTV allowed...  That's weird.  ...allowed that to happen, and where's the lawsuits, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Maybe it's fake.  Oh, wait.  Here's John in Georgia.  John, what's up?  Oh, one of the best parts...  Well, there's a couple best parts.  One is, I think it's Snooki on TV at the very beginning, just saying how every night she wants to go out and fuck a different Guido.  Yeah.  Oh, really? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's a...  What about the fist pump?  Yeah, Vinny.  I think it was Vinny who's obsessed with fist pumping.  It's standing in the ocean fist pumping.  Yeah, but the fist pump...  You can't just fist pump, though.  The Guido, you know, shows you how to do it.  You start down low, and you get it going, and then you get way up here.  Oh, my God.  I'm telling you, I haven't been...  I haven't been this excited about a junk TV show in a long fucking time. 
[00:12:30]  There you go.  See?  Oh, Jesus.  And then you get way up high.  Look at him sweating.  Wait, go...  Here.  I finally got the audio on.  Look at Vinny's pit stains.  Yeah.  Have fun at night.  You know what I mean?  Like party and fist pump like the best.  And then it starts, and then it comes off.  And then it comes off.  And then it all goes on.  I'm having your fist like a maniac.  Hey, I'm proud to be a F***ing Sweet-O.  Oh, I didn't get so...  This is my first 21 summer at the Jersey Shore. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, it's the whole episode.  Holy shit.  Definitely DVR the Jersey Shore.  People are going to be talking about this one.  They already are, I guess.  But, yeah.  All right.  What else is going on?  Speaking of junk TV, we've got some clips from Steven Seagal's Lawman.  Right in front of me.  Lawman.  Little Lawman.  I was also watching the new season came out, so it did like a marathon of I Survived.  Look at this JWoww.  JWoww.  Jenny JWoww. 
[00:13:30]  Big tits.  I can't wait to be a kid in a candy store.  I can't wait to see what happens.  I can't wait.  It's going to be interesting.  She's got that voice.  JWoww is coming.  Pretty face.  Ah, whatever.  She's a pretty face.  Like I said, Sam's getting some solid clips together.  We'll talk about it.  What were we saying at?  Fucking guy.  I was watching the, yeah, they had the season, I guess, premiere of I Survived on the Biography  Channel.  Bio.  And, um, man, there's some sick shit. 
[00:14:00]  There are some just twisted individuals out there.  Every time they went to a clip, too, of a woman, and they show the woman, like, kind  of sitting there, and she's going over this situation.  You don't really know what happened yet.  And then it's, you know, a guy breaks in, and then he asks me to take my clothes off.  There are so many rapes on this show.  Jesus.  Ah.  Rippity rape break.  There are so many.  And, uh, they also have that story, and we had talked about it a while ago. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, that chick, she was 15 years old at the time, got picked up by some guy in a van.  She, uh, falls asleep.  Would you?  She falls asleep, wakes up, and, um, the guy's over her, and smashes her in the head with,  like, a sledgehammer.  Ties her up.  A sledgehammer in the head?  Yeah.  Ties her up naked.  Rapes her for just hours on end.  Hours and hours on end.  And then she goes, oh, I, would you just set me free?  Would you just set me free?  He goes, well, you want to be set free? 
[00:15:00]  I'll set you free.  Takes a hatchet out.  Grabs her arm.  And just starts hacking at her arm.  Fuck.  Right just below the elbow?  Yeah.  And she goes, I was holding onto his, his arm, but I'm falling over.  And I'm like, how can I be falling over when I'm holding onto his, his arm?  Her arm was off and still gripping this guy's, uh, arm.  Um, and, and, and he chapped her other arm off.  And she's there now, two arms off.  Was she 15? 
[00:15:30]  Yes.  Threw her down in the ditch.  In California, right?  Yeah.  Yep.  The guy got 14 years.  14 fucking years for that.  He gets out.  What the fuck is the legal system doing?  And in 97, kill someone else.  What are they doing?  How do you get out in 14 years for raping and hacking the arms off a 15 year old?  For some reason, they said it was the, uh, the steepest penalty they could give someone  for that crime in California at the time.  It's like, what?  What?  I guaranteed someone with some weed on them would get more than 14 fucking years. 
[00:16:00]  How is that not attempted murder?  It was.  It was considered attempted murder and, uh, uh, rape and all kinds.  14 fucking years this guy got.  Jesus.  What year was that?  Ludicrous.  Um, well, if he got out, if he, 97, he killed again.  It had to be like, what, 83, maybe?  82?  Yeah, I think it was.  Has that been changed?  Unless he got out early for a good time.  They must have changed that fucking, uh, law.  Maybe he got out early for the good time.  But then he went out, he went out and, and just killed someone again.  And then he wound up getting the death penalty, but I think he died of, um, cancer in prison 
[00:16:30]  before he even got the death penalty.  This guy was sick.  And this chick is thrown off fucking embankment.  Now she's laying down there, no arms on the side of the embankment, knowing she's got  to get back up to the highway.  She took her stumps that were left and drilled them into the ground so the dirt would form  like a mud coating over it, crisp crumb coating.  A mud coating so she'd stop bleeding and then crawled her way up to the road where a car 
[00:17:00]  stopped and she went, help me, help me.  And then the car sped off.  I was just horrified.  She was covered with blood, no arms.  The guy got out and kicked her back down the hill.  Oh.  If you could do that again, then I'll help you.  Wow.  But, uh, that was a twisted ass story.  And to hear her tell it like, like it happened, um, there she is with her hook arms.  Is there a picture of the guy?  I can get her.  Oh, she's in good shape too.  She's pretty, man.  Yeah, I guess she, you know.  Wow.  Does a lot of lower body stuff. 
[00:17:30]  Her abs is a lot.  A lot of upper body work, I think.  That's just, that's just from getting out of bed every morning.  Yeah.  You know, working on her abs.  That's just from trying to get up without your arms.  What a horrifying story though.  She, uh, she, oh, it was 78, 1978.  Wow.  So he got out and wound up, but God knows how many other people he killed, uh, before he  was caught for the, the one in 97 where he went and got life in prison.  Um, just, um, but there he is.  Look at her.  She goes, yeah, he was an old grandfatherly type, I think. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  What a sick motherfucker.  That guy hacked, wow.  Yeah.  Hacked her arms off.  Oh, a few stories.  Well, when you said that he died of cancer, I was thinking it was a young guy, like, okay,  but no, he's an old guy that died of cancer in prison.  He was, uh, she goes, she was all like fucked up and, and she saw him flicking his, his hand,  like trying to get something off of it.  And it was her arm still gripping his, his arm. 
[00:18:30]  Jesus.  And he was like trying to flick it off of him because it was still gripping his arm.  Jesus.  Oh, and then other ones of people that were just left for dead, like shot in the head  and in the back and then had to just lay there.  This one, um, woman gets shot in the back and, uh, falls down and she's like, okay, I'm just  going to play dead.  I'm just going to lay here.  And then the guy proceeds to shoot her like two more times.  And she just lays there like, okay, I'm being shot and I have to lay here. 
[00:19:00]  Is that the one that called?  I think it might be the one I saw.  It was her boyfriend and she called 911.  And, uh, is that the one where they called?  No, that was a different one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another one that happened.  Dude, there are so many sick motherfuckers.  This other guy breaks into this apartment where two girls are just out of college.  They get a room.  One of the girls' fathers said, I'm getting bars for the windows because, uh, you're on  the ground floor here and it's dangerous.  And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Whatever.  And a guy breaks in and, uh, comes into this one, uh, girl's room and just, just starts 
[00:19:30]  raping her and, and asking her, this is good.  You love this, don't you?  And she's like, and she had to start talking to him like it was good because he had the knife  to her throat and shit and trying to get his confidence by saying how good it is.  And she, he goes, I know someone else lives here.  Tell me or I'll kill you.  So now she's got to go into her friend's room and go, hi, there's a rapist here.  He wants to rape the shit out of you.  Your turn.  And it was, he came and raped the shit out of her too. 
[00:20:00]  And then he only had a knife.  Did he have a gun too?  He had a knife.  He, he held the, the one roommate, he held her mouth while he raped her and kept the  throat to the other one's neck and kept asking the other one to comment on what  was going on.  So twisted.  Turned out to be a guy that lived in the same apartment complex.  But I've been watching them.  Yeah, I've been stalking.  I don't know how you can watch those shows.  Oh, it's twisted.  There's six shows.  I could watch a little bit, but that's it.  No, I did the whole marathon.  Oh, I saw people fucking slit the roads.  It's other, these two guys just trying to camp and have a good time. 
[00:20:30]  And some drifter comes up and, uh, it catch, it caught a little few trout.  So they put it up on the frying pan there.  They invite this guy to eat.  And then he walks behind him, shoots one guy in the head and shoots the other guy square  in the neck.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't want to lose this guy.  This guy, this guy's saying it was his grandfather.  Uh, Eddie in Jersey.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up guys?  My grandfather was actually the guy who stopped to pick that girl up.  Henry and my father were traveling through California.  And, um, my grandfather actually pulled away first. 
[00:21:00]  And my father said, what are you doing?  She's obviously armless.  I didn't know that joke.  It was a, it was a, it was a, you got me.  I used it last night, by the way.  I used that joke.  Why didn't they pick her up?  She looks armless.  No.  Yeah.  It was a honeymooning couple or something that, uh, picked, uh, picked, uh, picked her  up.  There was one good one I saw with that show where there was a guy walking.  It was on Sixth Avenue here in New York.  He's got an AT, he goes to ATM and he comes out and two black guys are in a car and they  gunpoint, put him in, kidnap him, take him to Brooklyn or Queens or something. 
[00:21:30]  They hold him for a few days and they, and he was a prosecutor and they had no idea.  I don't think that he was a prosecutor.  And, uh, he said they actually started getting friendly and he just talked to them and talked  to them and talked to them.  They tried to get him a hooker.  Uh, to get him a blow job.  It was his birthday, Stanley.  And, uh, he said, no, thank you.  I don't want to, because for some reason he didn't want them to see him.  I don't know why he said no, but he thought it would help him.  And they eventually let him go.  And he remembered where they were, uh, being a little, little nerdy prosecutor. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Both doing a lot of time in jail.  But he said he just talked and talked and talked and humanized himself by talking  to them.  Yeah.  Apparently a few people have mentioned that, that whole thing with, you know, yeah, I talked  a lot.  I did this discussion, kept calm, tried to keep calm.  How about the woman?  Remember that guy broke out of, this is not that show, but the guy that fucking shot up  the courtroom, that black dude, and he goes to, he takes that lady.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And, uh.  And she's like, yeah, we'll, we'll pray together.  And, you know.  And he spared her.  Yeah.  And he was killing cops and deputies. 
[00:22:30]  He was a motherfucker.  Oh, shit.  That guy didn't give a shit.  He was a naughty fella.  Yeah, that's a good show.  That's a solid show.  Man, the fucking, my fucking Jets are, uh, have a chance to fucking make the.  They're not going to make those.  What?  They're not going to make those.  They're not.  They're 6-6.  They're game out.  I know.  Because the Dolphins beat the fucking Patriots yesterday, 22-21.  What the hell's going on in that damn division?  Your Cowboys don't look good, Jimmy.  No, they look great.  Why tackle when you can just yell at someone, stop?  That fucking disgraceful tackling. 
[00:23:00]  Disgraceful special teams tackling.  And, you know, look.  Actually, it was 31-24.  Yeah.  Well, they, they had a 10-0 lead.  They had a 10-0 lead.  Oops.  And, uh, they, you know, they.  14-10.  It was fucking enraging, that game.  Enraging.  Did Brett Favre win last night?  Enra for around.  Anyone stay up late enough to watch the rest of the game?  No, he lost bad.  What was the final?  I think it was 30-17.  Wow.  That, you know what?  That shows I went to bed early.  Because it was, it was still a game when I went to bed. 
[00:23:30]  Really?  He got spanked, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, he threw two picks.  Oh, bound to happen to the poor guy.  Yeah.  I had ESPN Classic on for some stupid reason while I was sleeping.  I think I was watching poker or something.  And I woke up and, uh, couldn't find the remote.  And this, uh, college game was on from 1974.  It was hysterical.  A football game.  Right.  It was just hysterical to watch.  The, they, they had like the, uh, they had the scores from other games that were going 
[00:24:00]  on at the time.  And they're literally on a roller, rolling in front of the screen.  Oh, wow.  Because you'd see it like back up a little bit.  Like old game show credits would go by and shit like that.  Oh, no kidding.  And the camera angle was so bad that when they kicked a field goal, the announcers couldn't  tell whether it went through or not.  Because they only had that one angle.  They were like, I'm not sure.  They had one angle and you couldn't even tell.  Yeah.  Anything.  Unfortunately, we remember watching sports when they had one fucking camera. 
[00:24:30]  One angle.  I'm embarrassed to admit that today, but.  And the quarterback running like a motherfucker.  They still run like motherfuckers in college football.  I mean, no, I'm talking running, then head first, trying to get through the line.  Not even like, all right, I'll run and I might take a little hit.  These guys are running and taking massive hits.  Football is in serious trouble.  They're talking about the concussion a lot this year.  Yeah.  What, start taking people out? 
[00:25:00]  Well, they don't know what the fuck to do.  The problem is these guys are getting too big and too strong for the sport.  Yeah, they're really killing each other.  You know, fast forward another five or six years, I think football's got some serious  problems.  Yeah, I guess they're saying if the symptoms aren't there anymore of a concussion, that  the guy can play.  Right.  And some of the people in the medical community are saying, no, it's not just the symptoms  that have to go away.  You've got to rest your brain that was just smashed against the inside of your skull. 
[00:25:30]  You're not supposed to be taking any other hits.  No.  But I think football's going to have some serious problems.  Yeah.  These guys are just animals.  They're just getting stronger, faster, bigger.  Yeah.  And I don't know if the equipment could keep up.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens.  Oh, also, yeah, I'm talking about this old 1974 college game.  You watched this for five minutes, by the way.  You're not sitting through a 1974 college fucking football game.  Dude, I swear, I think I watched the whole fourth quarter. 
[00:26:00]  Why would you?  Because it's just so nostalgic to watch.  Like, they would do something, and the band was all like, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, and  they're showing it.  And they're showing oldie-time cheerleaders.  And then there's 16 seconds left on the clock after this field goal kicker missed the game-winning  field goal from, like, 38 yards out.  Look how close the fans are to the field, too.  Dude, they poured onto the field with 16 seconds left.  They had to clear them off, and they started ripping the goalposts down. 
[00:26:30]  Well, just what, lawyers wrecked that, too.  I guarantee it.  Just blame lawyers for everything.  They ripped the goalposts down, too.  Dude, I'm telling you, I was at Rich Stadium up there in Buffalo, and I was fortunate enough  to be at a game where they ripped the goalposts down and carried it out of the stadium.  I told you the story where they tried to figure out how to get the goalposts out of the stadium,  so they figured, you know what?  We could just push it over the top.  Just lob it over the top.  So hundreds of fans are just carrying this thing over the top of the stadium, and then 
[00:27:00]  it goes over the side of the stadium.  It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life.  They're security.  I wonder if there's any video of that online, because, I mean, this goes back to, I think,  I guess I've got to say late 80s.  They were still doing that?  Early 90s, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  And then I told you, we were driving home, and people are walking down the roads with  a huge piece of the goalposts still. 
[00:27:30]  Dude.  Yeah, there you go.  Look at the guy just scores a touchdown.  I guess it was 3-3.  Hey, something happened.  Either a pickoff.  He's not even in the end zone yet, and people are flooding onto the field.  Right.  They'd be shot now.  They're right on the edge of the field.  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing.  I watch ESPN Classic for hockey.  The old school hockey games where they have, you know, chain link fence fences because they  don't have the plexiglass yet.  And, of course, the goalies without the freaking goalie mask. 
[00:28:00]  Just insane stuff.  I love watching for the horrible announcing, for the most part, and the bad cameras, and  the horrid graphics that they used.  Yeah, but all that was state-of-the-art.  I know.  The announcer's state-of-the-art.  The fucking graphic's state-of-the-art coverage.  You never said to yourself, like, oh, my God, that graphic looks awful.  And we were talking about this.  Fuck.  And slow motion.  They showed some slow motion stuff that was, like, a blur.  You couldn't see anything. 
[00:28:30]  It was like, I think he was going in for this, past this guy.  Couldn't see shit.  Now, it's crystal clear.  You could see shoelaces, you know.  Did you watch some real college football over the weekend?  No.  Why would I?  You didn't watch Bama beat the Gators?  No.  Oh, man.  Well, you have a vested interest in the Gators.  With the Tebow.  Oh, I don't have any.  Not really.  My nephew graduated.  He's on to fucking medical school, that brainiac. 
[00:29:00]  Anthony.  What the fuck was he going to tell you?  What was this?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, was that the.  Well, we got the Lawman Clips.  We'll play a little later.  Jersey Shore.  Oh, yeah.  Greedo Beach.  You want to hear some of this?  Oh, let's hear some of this.  Yeah, there's Tebow crying.  And fucking.  That's pretty funny, man.  Bama beat the Gators.  So, the Bama players, a couple of them are doing the Gator chomp.  Oh.  Like, there's your Gator chomp.  Oh, that's not very nice.  No.  It was number two versus number one, man. 
[00:29:30]  It was the game of the weekend.  Is he crying?  Yeah.  Wait.  Tebow.  The guy is.  The guy.  The guy.  The guy.  That's Tebow.  He lost?  Yeah.  Number one lost?  Number one lost to number two.  So, why was the guy.  Was the quarterback crying?  What a bitch.  Look at him.  His.  His under-eye black shit is all smearing.  It's.  It's my makeup running.  It's Tebow's final year.  It's very emotional for the guy.  I'm sure it is.  His college career is just about over.  And, you know.  He's not happy about it. 
[00:30:00]  Wasn't Tebow simmered down?  Man up.  Okay.  Let's do some Jersey Shore clips before the break here.  Yeah.  I want to hear some of these brain surgeons.  All right.  We meet Pauly D.  Sam watches the show.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  I've seen the first episode at least four times.  By the way, you're trying to turn us on to a lot of shows.  You weren't trying to turn us on to this one. 
[00:30:30]  I found out from other people that this show was worth a beat.  I told you about it on Friday.  I thought everybody knew about this.  I heard about it Wednesday, Thursday.  This is the biggest show on the Wednesday, Sunday, Saturday.  Who's your favorite?  The Situation.  Yeah, The Situation's an asshole.  The Situation.  They have to work at like a t-shirt shop, you know, on the Jersey Shore.  Yeah.  And he's talking like old bags to buy panties that say The Situation on it.  People hate on The Situation, but when you take your shirt off and look like Rambo, it's like, you know. 
[00:31:00]  Is that what he said?  He really does have depressingly good abs.  He's like Voss, but he's in perfect shape.  Situation.  He's the best.  He's one of the best characters in any television show.  Shut up.  Not reality show.  What's Snooki?  No, Snooki's second best on the show.  The Snook.  The Snookster.  Except they all call her Snickers and Schnookums.  You can never remember her name.  And the first night she gets fucking just wasted.  Of course.  Puking everywhere.  Nice.  I mean, it's a revolution in reality television.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  A bunch of young dummies fucking drinking. 
[00:31:30]  It's just the real world for Guidos, man.  Yeah.  I know, but this is, that's the revolution.  Guidos and Guidos.  Out here in Rhode Island, Guidos.  All right, here's Pauly Day.  We meet Pauly Day.  Out here in Rhode Island, Guidos.  When we stop, our chrome keeps spinning.  Hold on, hold on.  I got to even stop right there.  Why?  Isn't Guido like a derogatory term?  Yep.  Is it used like nigga?  Where it's like, it's like you could use it amongst yourselves and it's not derogatory. 
[00:32:00]  No, anybody can say it, except it's a, it describes a subculture of Italian people.  But I'm thinking if an Irish guy, right?  Absolutely.  You got a few Irish guys and they go to the Jersey Shore and they're hanging out and you're  like, hey, you fucking Guido.  I'm thinking they're going to like start fucking romping.  Yep.  Of course.  When you say it with that sort of tonality.  That's kind of luster.  That's what I mean.  Dude, this show is all about, they just go out every night and there's fights everywhere.  Of course.  And the girls are puking and the girls are making out with three different guys. 
[00:32:30]  It's just insane, this show.  Just the four.  Hey, was there a horrendous hit in the Vikings game last night?  YouTube, the hit on the Vikings linebacker last night, the dude breaks his femur.  Ow, fuck.  I'm telling you, football has some serious problems in the future.  These guys are too big and too strong for the game.  That would have to hurt.  I don't know what kind of rules they can make.  I don't know what kind of equipment changes they can make to keep this game going.  Just build robots to play.  I'm thinking you just turn them into gladiators. 
[00:33:00]  They're running down the field.  They were even talking about the concussion problem is so bad, they're like, will manufacturers  even make the helmets after a while?  Because they don't want, you know.  They're going to get sued.  They don't want the liability.  Yeah.  So they're like, you know, the question is, will they continue to make the helmets?  Helmet will not protect head.  With all the concussions.  Disclaimer.  Helmet not made to protect head.  Because I'm sure some of these guys, after their careers are ruined because of a few concussions, 
[00:33:30]  they're going after everybody, including the helmet makers.  Oh, fucking Steve from Bayshore.  Huh.  Yeah, Steve from Bayshore is kind of saying what another player did with the guy's femur.  Oh, really?  That involves his nose.  You take the femur bone?  I don't even get it.  I'm going to get it.  God damn, Steve from Bayshore.  Let's go to Pauly D.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  I was born and raised with Guido.  It's just a lifestyle.  It's being Italian.  It's representing family, friends, tanning, gel, everything.  I got a tanning bed in my place.  That's how it's here.  Right after friends and family comes tanning and gel.  This is a guy who had 15 bottles of hair gel that he had to put in his suitcase.  It's everything Italian.  You know, it's his family, friends, gel, fuck tanning, gel.  Did you get the clip where the chick goes, I'll cut your hair while you sleep? 
[00:34:30]  There's so many clips.  I know.  I don't even know where to go.  She had some problem, right?  It's, you know, their old roommates.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I don't have that.  She goes, I'll cut your hair while you're sleeping.  I guess that would be a major problem to a Guido.  That's got to be huge.  To cut a Guido and gel, everything.  I got a tanning bed in my place.  That's how serious I am about being a Guido and living up to that lifestyle.  My tagline is I'm your girl's favorite DJ.  I want the Guidats to in their pants when they hear my music.  It takes me about 25 minutes to do my hair. 
[00:35:00]  It comes out perfect every single time.  There's no way I'm going to Jersey without my hair gel.  Can't leave it on my gel.  When I hit the Jersey show, they're going to see a new Guido.  Every girl loves the new guy.  25 minutes on your hair and you're a dude.  He's got a gel, dude.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Does your hair look perfect every time you go out?  When you go out to the club, you've got to look right.  You've got to look fresh, clean, perfect hair.  I probably spend 25 seconds on my hair every day.  That's why you don't get the girls that Pauly D has.  I haven't combed my hair in 20 years. 
[00:35:30]  Pauly D is because he's the one who later on in the episode started hooking up with JWoww at the club.  Yeah.  And even though she had a boyfriend, said that JWoww wanted to have her cake and eat it too.  And he'll be that guy.  He doesn't mind.  He'll be.  I thought you'd see those tits.  Of course you don't mind.  This is so stupid.  Is there a lot of smart dialogue in this show?  Yes.  Yeah.  I bet.  Well, let's say hi to Sammy.  She's a guide.  Yeah, Sammy Sweetheart.  Sammy Sweetheart's kind of nice. 
[00:36:00]  She's all right.  Kind of like that Sammy Sweetheart.  She's a little bit of a whore.  I'm going around town.  It's Sammy Sweetheart.  I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet, but do not f*** with me.  I'm not looking for Mr. Right.  I am looking to break a lot of hearts and to get with a lot of good, hot, sexy guidos.  Your number one mission is to go out and find the hottest guidos and take him home.  The smaller the shorts, the better, because all the little guidos guys out there love  them.  I love to get dolled up. 
[00:36:30]  I love to look good.  I can never go out without my hair extension.  A guidette is somebody who knows how to club it up, takes really good care of themselves,  has pretty hair, cakes on makeup, has tanned skin, wears the hottest heels, pretty much  they know how to own it and rock it.  If you're not a guido, then you can get the f*** out of my face.  See?  Holy shit.  And the only date, yeah.  I'd love her to f*** Voss and then find out he's a Jew.  How great would that be?  Voss kind of has the guidos thing on.  He tries.  Oh my God.  I f***ed a Jew. 
[00:37:00]  And a drooly one.  Alright, let's meet the...  I thought it was hair gel coming out, but it was drool.  Let's meet Snooki.  Hair gel.  Here's Snooki.  I'm going to Jersey Shore, bitch.  Thanks.  I want to marry Guido.  My ultimate dream is to move to Jersey, find a nice, juiced, hot, tan guy, and live my  life. 
[00:37:30]  Guido applications accepted.  Over here.  I love guidos.  Let's go.  I like canned Italian boys with muscles.  Size does not matter.  You know, even though I'm small, I have a loud mouth.  I stick up for myself and I don't give a f***.  You haven't seen anything until you see me at the Jersey Shore.  She's the one in the preview where she gets knocked the f*** out.  She gets knocked out.  She gets punched in the face as hard as I've ever seen anyone.  Wow.  She gets punched in the face.  That was the last clip of the preview. 
[00:38:00]  And it's like, if you're not hooked after that.  They said, coming up this season, they're just like, oh, the guidos.  Oh, they're putting in hair gel.  Oh, they're arguing.  And then all of a sudden, Snooki gets punched in the face.  While she's sitting at the bar and she has a hat on.  That hat goes flying.  Is there a clip of that?  It should be in the preview.  The preview clip's got to be online.  All right, then we move on to The Situation.  The Situation is a breakout star.  Breakout star.  He is going to be big.  He's going big places after this show. 
[00:38:30]  You think?  The Situation is the next big thing.  Mm-hmm.  This is The Situation right here.  My abs are so ripped up, it's called The Situation.  A guido is a good-looking, smooth, well-dressed Italian.  It's good.  I check out the mirror, I'm like, whew, today's going to be a good day.  Girls love guidos.  I'm not even joking.  I know girls that just go for that.  I mean, you can hate on me all you want to, but what can you possibly say to somebody that  looks like Rambo pretty much with his shirt off? 
[00:39:00]  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  He pretty much looks like Rambo with his shirt off.  He calls himself The Situation because of his abs?  Yeah, because he named his abs The Situation, and then he took it on himself.  He is The Situation.  What is The Situation, though?  I don't understand.  Well, like girls, that's what you would say.  If you said, what's The Situation, he'd lift up his shirt and say, right here is The Situation.  Here's The Situation.  Here's The Situation, yo.  Pretty much look like Rambo.  Without his shirt off.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I mean, this is the greatest show MTV's probably ever produced. 
[00:39:30]  Really?  Well, the first two hours were just, I was hooked.  It's only going to get better from here.  All right, Paula D. arrives at The House, meets The Situation, and comes up with a plan.  Yeah, you got to see, when these two guys put their mind together, wait till you see  what they came up with for their room.  In the Cadillac, riding out.  I'm so anxious to see what this place looks like.  I've never been to Jersey.  Yeah, this is it right here.  Oh, look at the entire flag.  This is what I'm talking about.  That's it.  So I pulled up.  I was pumped.  Shut up, homie.  What's up, man?  Four.  What's up, Mikey? 
[00:40:00]  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  What's going on, man?  Just trying to get the nice room or the nice bathroom, trying to check it out.  So if I was you, I would pick out something, you know what I mean?  Yeah, let me see.  So I walk in.  I see the first dude.  Right off the bat, we click.  I got a nice amount of stuff, but definitely not as much as you.  We decided that we're going to bunk together, and then we were thinking, we can bunk with  a chick.  That'd be kind of cool.  Bunk with a chick.  That might be kind of cool.  And they also, like, they go in to this house.  And they start talking, like, they're trying to be as intricate with their words as possible 
[00:40:30]  and saying, it's very nice decorations.  It's a nicely decorated place.  The interior's nice.  The walls are covered.  There's a Scarface poster.  There's a giant vanity New Jersey license plate that says, New Joy-Z, N-U-J-O.  Spell fuck that.  Damn.  And then there's a big Italian flag with a Cadillac logo.  It's just the tackiest, most stereotypical, insulting house you could ever live in. 
[00:41:00]  That's like having a show with black kids with, like, a watermelon statue.  Yes.  We're Irish with a big guy vomiting.  Watermelon statue.  A watermelon statue.  This is, where's the, um, where's that Italian group guy that gets involved in everything?  Uh, saying the Sopranos were, like, offensive to Italians, where this is just, like, the  He had a heart attack when he saw that.  They are pissed off.  Domino's has already pulled sponsorship from the show.  Why?  I guarantee you the show doesn't last. 
[00:41:30]  The pressure will mount and they will pull every, every time.  I don't know, man.  The ratings are huge on this show right now.  I'll start a support group to keep this show on the air.  This show just fucking exploded out of nowhere.  Huh.  Uh, the situation works out and gives some advice to the audience.  Yeah.  You like my moves?  We do our thing in the gym and we work out hard.  We take it seriously.  We make sure that we have certain foods afterwards.  We got to get back to the house, man.  That protein ball.  You know, it'll be alright.  If you want to look somewhat like the situation, which is definitely going to be pretty hard,  uh, you need to get that protein in your diet. 
[00:42:00]  See?  If you want to look somewhat like the situation.  Somewhat.  You're never going to look like the situation.  Oh!  See, it's Snooki!  Here it is!  Here it is!  Watch her get...  That's Snooki!  Boom!  Oh!  How is that on TV?  Oh, I watched that clip like...  So she fucking gets...  Look at the guy.  Like, what's...  The guy just gives her a right cross to the gym.  I am really shocked they're showing this.  Did he fucking punch her in the face? 
[00:42:30]  I watched that clip 19 times minimum this weekend.  That is a fantastic right hand he gives her.  An amazing right hand.  And her head's in perfect position for it.  Oh!  That's a right cross.  She did not expect that hat removal.  Wow!  Shut her up.  And then five minutes later, you see them in love.  Dainty?  Yeah!  But look in the guy's face.  He had it with Snooki.  What was she doing that got him...  That's the preview.  We don't know.  She was mouthing off.  Snooki's got a mouth on her.  Yeah, big time.  Well, fuck.  Hopefully there's teeth in it still.  Yeah.  Look at that. 
[00:43:00]  Just all fighting.  Paulie D got in a fight and kicked out of the club on the first episode.  Because somebody pushed one of his boys.  Oh, here we go.  We got info on the people protesting.  Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  Hey, Ronnie B was saying something on Friday about...  They were talking about it.  And MTV told...  They'd been getting a bunch of letters and everything about it.  MTV told them that they didn't care.  They were standing by the ship.  Yeah.  Well, hold on.  Let me explain something about MTV, by the way.  They're owned by CBS.  Yes.  CBS is the company that told us we can't do any more Asian humor when we were still doing 
[00:43:30]  regular radio.  Were they owned by CBS or by the same parent company?  Well, the same whatever.  They're under the same...  Yeah.  Okay.  They're under the same corporate umbrella.  And for some reason, we weren't allowed to do any more Asian humor.  And this is all Italian.  Yeah, yeah.  Basically.  MTV's official statement has been that the protesters should wait and see the rest of  the season before they pass judgment.  Really?  Let the whole season air.  Too many clips on this season on the Jersey Shore.  It's insane. 
[00:44:00]  Let me tell you something.  I have no problem with it because there are people like this out there.  Yes, the Guido's.  They're not making anything up here.  There are people that act like this and do this, and it's entertaining as hell to watch.  All I'm saying is, let's take it farther and go and just do the same thing with a bunch  of black guys.  And have another show with, yeah, a bunch of fucking drunken Irish.  Well, you know what?  Just do all the different races.  But I think if this show is a hit, I bet you that's the way they go. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah?  I bet you that's the way they go.  Yeah, because the Jersey Shore is all, it's not just the Italians down there.  They love doing the Italians, though.  This is not the first Jersey Shore visit for MTV.  They have a Freaknik show.  Freaknik!  Where you just see fucking, like, dancing in the street, fucking savage behavior.  MTV has done three different one-hour true-life documentaries.  I'm going to the Jersey Shore already.  Oh, so they know they got gold.  I mean, that's how they developed this show. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, we got another clip from the situation selling T-shirts and booty shorts.  I can sell a T-shirt standing still.  Matter of fact, I just sold one just right now.  Let's pick something out, girls.  What are we going to get on here?  I really, I really like, like, the situation.  Like, I love the situation.  I mean, I didn't really show you guys, you know, what's going on here.  But, that is, that's the situation.  Like, he was working it, you know, he had the abs and everything.  Any girl that came into the shop, you need booty shorts with I love the situation.  I mean, we can get anything on it. 
[00:45:30]  Maybe, like, I love the situation, or...  Everybody loves me.  Babies, dogs, you know, hot girls, cougars.  So, are we going to get something for moms?  Does moms need anything?  I just have unbelievable mass appeal.  I need to trademark this.  I need to trademark.  Is it trademark?  He works at a t-shirt shop where you can print whatever you want written on the shirt  of the booty shorts, right?  Why wouldn't there be a boot for that?  He's putting up panties or little booty shorts that say, the situation.  With the situation.  I'm going to rifle through my girlfriend's drawer, and if I find anything with the situation 
[00:46:00]  on it, I'm going to fuck her and then kill her.  The situation.  We got a guy, Owen, from the Jersey Shore.  He has a little more info on this whole damn thing.  Owen, what do you know?  What's up, guys?  I live down here.  I actually live right close to here, and when they applied for the show, MTV has done  two shows down here.  They used to do that summer, that whole summer house.  They did it twice here, and when they applied to Seaside Heights, they said, hey, listen, 
[00:46:30]  we're going to do a show, we're going to do a show, and they said Seaside Heights couldn't  say no, so they just said okay, and they found out that while the show was going on, they  found out all the crap that they were going to do, and the way they were going to make  Italian-Americans look.  The Italian-American organization is trying to get the whole thing stopped, but they couldn't  get it stopped.  I guarantee it doesn't make it through.  It will eventually get off, because the advertisers will start targeting the parent company, and  I guarantee the show will get yanked.  We'll see.  Funny.  We'll still have this whole gel thing. 
[00:47:00]  It's too good.  It's too good.  The situation.  Well, Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, what the fuck are K-O-O-G-H-I-Z-Z?  Cougars.  Was he trying to say cougars?  Cougars.  Cougars.  Like cougars?  Cougars.  Yeah, they like me, too.  I bet this show makes it, and then the situation gets its own show afterwards.  A little spin-off action?  Of course he will, and a movie deal.  Stephen Bayshore is also saying he hopes that the situation in the future includes cancer.  Oh, come on, why would you hope that for the situation? 
[00:47:30]  What's wrong with you?  He's in such good shape.  He sure is a ghoul.  Have you seen how tan he is?  Oh, the situation?  Yeah.  Of course.  Here's a douche.  Here's Snooki arriving at the house.  Hello, party's here.  The party's here?  How are you?  Good, cool.  Hug.  Nice to meet you.  How are you?  I'm like, wow.  She was like a little miniature chihuahua painted with some spray paint black.  Yeah.  You guys drinking or what? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, it's right here.  Woo!  Give me a shot.  This is crazy.  What's your nickname?  Snooki.  Snooker.  A snooker.  Nobody calls it Snookies.  Snook, Snick, Snickers.  I don't even know what it is.  That was the minute she arrived in the house.  It's still the morning, and she's asking, where are the shots?  Shots!  Shots!  Woo!  And they're not really young.  No, like, Pauly D is 29 years old.  He's 29?  Pauly D.  One of the guys is 29.  I thought they were all like...  These were adults?  Like, for real?  Yeah, I think they're all out of... 
[00:48:30]  They're like 21 or something.  Yeah, I think most of them are out of fucking college.  Oh, definitely.  The one, JWoww, was pissed at Pauly D because Pauly D was trying to get a 20-year-old to make  out with him in the hot tub.  Yeah.  Jesus.  They were fishing off the roof for girls.  That's right.  They were fishing.  Holy shit.  But the best part is that they shout off the roof, hey, girls, you want to come up?  And the girls say, yes, we do.  They do?  They were getting ass all over the place.  First episode, they're just getting ass everywhere.  Wow.  Weeders get girls.  Here's Snooki getting drunk. 
[00:49:00]  Where's the game?  Superman?  The f***?  Come on.  Looking around at my fingers.  That's why I hate guys.  I love you.  I love you.  And I love you.  And I love all my roommates.  Are you serious?  Little Snickers, she didn't waste any time grabbing up and playing Ring Around the Rosie.  She was having a good old time.  Oh, is that wonderful?  And then Snickers joins us in the hot tub, and that's when the party started.  Yo, can you get that s***?  What?  Look at the jacuzzi right now.  Snooki's wearing a bra and a leopard thong into the hot tub with four testosterone-ridding 
[00:49:30]  guidos.  What is she thinking?  I would not be able to do that.  What is she doing, this girl?  How do you go in a jacuzzi with a thong and a bra?  Wear a thong bikini.  It's a little bit more classier if you're going to wear anything at all.  That is a blast.  The word classy should not even f***ing be in this situation.  It's more classier.  It's more classier.  It's more classier to wear a thong bikini than a thong underwear. 
[00:50:00]  Of course.  And then Snooki goes in and tried to make out with every single guy in the house, and  none of them were having it.  Just throwing herself on them.  The other one was Angelina, whose nickname is Jolie.  Oh, right, right.  That's what they call her.  Worked at the t-shirt store.  And she told the camera that she thought she was above working.  Like, the t-shirt store was beneath her.  Because back home, she's a bartender.  She does great things.  And that was her quote.  I do great...  I'm a bartender.  I do great things. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  She can't work at a t-shirt store.  She's a bartender.  Dude, the show, it's worth checking out.  It's so ridiculous.  How many episodes have aired?  Just a one, two hour.  Yeah.  Technically, it's two, one hour episodes.  Oh, it's a one hour show.  It's a one hour show.  Yeah.  But they start with a two hour fucking premiere, man.  I may have to watch that.  I fucking watched every minute.  I was hooked.  I haven't been hooked on an MTV show in many years.  If we could get one of those guys on the show, would you take them?  Oh, in a second.  Yeah.  Might as well.  In a second.  I'm already trying to track down Snooki.  Yeah.  You know, there are so many Tiger Woods whores out there. 
[00:51:00]  Can't we get one of them on our show at this point?  No, they're all buoyed up.  Every single one of them?  Yeah.  They're all waiting for their payday, dude.  Yeah.  Uncle Sully writes from Beacon Hill,  I hope you need to play Italian storm chasers and to break.  We could do that today if we still have that around there, Travis.  I think it's time for a break, actually.  Yeah.  One more thing I love about that show is that, like, Guidos is a very East Coast thing.  That's why all these kids come from the East Coast.  Yeah, true.  It's opening up an entire world to the Guido subculture. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, so you're thinking maybe they might take on, like, you know, like the rap culture  is taken over in middle America.  I'm telling you, Guidos are going to pop up in every little town everywhere.  They're going to say, oh, yeah, I could jell up my hair.  Look at all the girls the situation gets.  That's what I need to do.  I'll start tanning.  Yeah.  Our good friend, Coke Logic, has just named his abs.  Oh, what is it called?  Well, actually, because of his abs.  I've now named my gut the Abomination.  The Abomination. 
[00:52:00]  The Abomination.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  Let me go.  A lot of people checking out this show.  Walter in Connecticut.  Walter.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hi, Walt.  The situation, he goes, yeah, you know, if I ever saw myself in a club, I told my girl a little  partner, too, you know, saying he's going to steal someone's girl.  Oh, if he was in a club and saw himself.  Yeah, he goes.  He would hold his girl a little tighter.  He goes, if I walked into a club and I saw me walk in, I'd hold my girl a little tighter, 
[00:52:30]  too.  Oh, that's great.  And then Snooki, she gets up the next day, she throws up, and one of the other girls  is like, oh, get away.  You're not going to put your puke wrap on us.  Everybody's pissed.  That's on rocks.  Well, then Snooki brought some dude home the first night, and he went on the roof to watch  the sunrise, and the guy is so fucking hammered, he starts puking on all their nice MTV shit.  Yeah.  And so one of the Guido roommates is like, yo, can you at least get him puking over the 
[00:53:00]  side?  Hey, yo.  So then the guy walks to the side of the roof and is just fucking hurling.  And then Snooki walks the guy home all pissed off because she didn't get any action with  the guy.  That's great.  Chicks getting punched, alcoholism, puking.  Snooki had this quote, she goes, I'm looking for a tan, muscular, gelled up guy, but they're  hard to get because it's the Jersey Shore, you know?  What are you even talking about?  What?  Where's the situation from? 
[00:53:30]  Um, the situation, I believe, I'm trying to remember, uh, I don't know.  Is he a New York guy?  Um, yeah, I think he might be like a Staten Island, maybe a Staten Island.  I'm going to be a Staten Island.  He's not a, he's not a, from the city.  He might be listening right now, who knows?  I can't comprehend that world.  Why?  No, no.  I mean, I've performed for enough of them, but I can't comprehend doing well and enjoying  that world.  New York has a lot of Guidos.  Yeah.  And you shouldn't say no, we grew up with a lot of Guidos around us.  Pitsy, who used to work on Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  He should have been on this show.  Yeah.  Now, me growing up, though, that wasn't, it hadn't really been, meh. 
[00:54:00]  But, in high school, there was, you know, the guy with the fucking IROC.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  The IROC Camaro and the fucking chick and shit like that.  But it wasn't a culture like this.  It wasn't some kind of thing.  It was just, it was just like, hey, that's fucking, you know, that's Richie and he's a  fucking asshole.  Yeah.  You know.  And Maria, his chick.  Being a fucking asshole is a subculture.  Yeah.  She's a bunch of assholes. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Now it's a bunch of assholes.  Let's go to Pam.  And then set rules for her and everything.  Pam, what do you got?  Pam.  Hey, Pam.  Oh, Pam.  She's probably off with the situation right now.  I'll bet you she's counting those abs with her tongue and lips kissing them.  Whoever I'm talking to right now, it's your turn.  Everyone say hi.  Hello.  Hi.  What's your name, girl?  What's your name?  I'm from Brooklyn.  What's up?  Wait, what's your name?  Nastassia.  Hi.  Nastassia.  How did I ever get Pam? 
[00:55:00]  It says Pam.  Her name's...  They just made up a name because they couldn't spell Nastassia.  All right, what do you got?  I wanted to know if you guys had the clip where the situation tells Angelina.  to lose five or ten pounds and then we could talk.  Yeah, because she was getting a little lippy.  So he's like, look, why don't you lose five or ten pounds and then maybe we'll talk.  Are you attracted to the situation, madam?  I love the show.  I love it.  Are you a guidette?  No, I'm actually black and I'm from Brooklyn, so it's nice to see another stereotype.  That water melody, that water melody, that water melody, that water melody.  It's only good. 
[00:55:30]  Now, would you sleep with the situation?  Not at all, no.  Yes, you would.  Okay, yes, come on.  Yes, you would.  If the situation was around, he started talking to you, showing you the situation.  Oh, come on.  Watch out, hair.  What is this, a Bronx tale?  Stop it.  The situation couldn't do that.  He'd be thrown out of the fucking regimen.  He's looking for guidettes.  But you like seeing the other stereotype, right?  Yeah, why do you like the show?  I love it.  I love it.  It's great.  It's wonderful.  And the fact, first of all, they're fucking morons. 
[00:56:00]  That's the best part.  In fact, they're idiots.  And the fact that he thinks that he's so hot and he's not, it's amazing.  What are you talking about?  MTV's hit gold.  What are you talking about?  They hit gold with the show.  I love it.  I love it.  I went to work and I was telling everyone, you have to watch the show.  So when I heard you guys talking about it, I jumped on the phone and, oh my God.  Awesome.  It's the best show ever.  Hey.  Guys, I got to punch out and go to work.  I love the show.  What?  You have to go to work?  Thank you, madam.  What?  Call the paper. 
[00:56:30]  We found one.  Bye, miss.  Bye.  All right.  The situation gave tips on how to go to the club and feel as fresh as possible.  You got to make sure you get a haircut the day of and then you wait.  And right before you go out, that's when you shave and put on a new white shirt right  before.  None of this.  You know, you get yourself ready, but you just wear your wife beater around the house.  Right, of course.  And then right before you go out, put on your white shirt, make sure you get a fresh shave.  And there's one animal that hasn't worn a shirt yet.  Yeah.  In the two-hour episode, he didn't even have a shirt on the entire fucking time. 
[00:57:00]  Is there anybody with a gut or tits?  Any guys?  Hell no.  How could you be a hint of a fat cell?  These fuckers.  Didn't you hear what the situation said?  You got to get some protein in your diet and you'll maybe look somewhat like the situation.  Maybe look somewhat.  Would you like to look like the situation?  I wish I looked like the situation.  A little while, actually.  Could we dress you up like a Guido?  Yeah.  How could we do that?  I don't know.  We got to get some Guido.  Get a fucking drum of gel.  And paint roller it into his hair.  Yeah.  And then light him on fire. 
[00:57:30]  Walt, New Jersey Shore.  What do you got?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Hi, Walt.  Listen, I used to work down there in a seafood place.  And we have a secret language down there calling all these ethical backgrounds different names.  So we called these fuckers Guile from Street Fighter.  So any time these guys used to come up, we go, hey, Guile, what do you guys want?  Hey, Guile, what do you guys want?  Guile had the big hair.  They had no idea that we talked about.  Oh, okay, right.  From Street Fighter.  Yes.  Yeah, right on.  That's good. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, there is a...  We would call Isaac, black people Isaac, Mexican stans in it, and all kinds of different  clothes.  Why black people Isaac from the love boat?  Yep.  Okay.  Yeah, he goes, yeah, Isaac.  What do you mean?  Right on.  Let's go to Jason and Coram.  Look at this guy.  We'll just look at that Guido picture.  See, that's what girls like.  Jason and Coram.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I think you guys are forgetting that on Fox has been a black reality show for quite some  time now. 
[00:58:30]  It's called Cops.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, see.  That's totally inappropriate.  That's not...  Come on.  Oh, Belle.  What happened?  What happened?  Let's try to talk about Jersey Shore here.  Jimmy James.  Tiger can't keep his dick out of anything, apparently.  Bless him.  Yeah, we're going to get the fucking scorecard after the break on Tiger Woods.  Put me down for nine.  Including the naughty shit that just wasn't really...  Not surprising.  Naughty, naughty.  Gossip was right.  Jimmy James, what do you got?  Morning, boys.  Hey, I just wanted to correct Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  There were Guidos around when he was young.  Unfortunately, they all looked like John Travolta with hairspray instead of hair gel.  And that cigarette?  Yeah, you're probably right, you know.  They had a different look.  It wasn't a gel thing, yeah.  I'm going dancing.  The feathered back hair.  In the hairspray.  I'm touching that one.  I'm going dancing.  All right.  You get the point.  The phones are still lit on the subject.  We could talk about Guidos all day.  We should, maybe.  Could you get a couple more clips?  Hell yeah.  All right.  What do you want? 
[00:59:30]  What do the people want?  You want more situation?  You want to meet the little Pauly D?  The situation would be good.  But also, yeah, the old guy, Pauly D.  You know, did...  Do you want to go over the love triangle that went down with Ronnie and Pauly D, Sammy Sweetheart?  Aw, shit, yo.  You want to...  She started with one guy.  She started with the situation.  Well, the situation started with her, too.  Yeah, so the situation was put in his place because at the club, she decided that one of the other guys in the house...  Ronnie, the big muscular guy.  Ronnie, I guess, yeah, is hotter or whatever. 
[01:00:00]  So she started making out with him, and the situation was fucking pissed.  He was heated.  He was heated.  Because no one fucking does that to the situation, ever.  How did the situation handle it?  Let's hear the clips.  I'll get the clip.  All right, get the clip of that.  And we've got to get a picture of JWoww for the boys.  JWoww was...  Where she walks around with, like...  She's pretty much topless.  Yeah, she tapes fabric to her breast implants.  And that's it.  It's amazing.  And then she's sitting there, and Pauly D. starts hooking up with her.  But they're just laying on the bed, and he's got his arm around her, and he's got his shirt off, of course. 
[01:00:30]  And she's supposed to not be doing anything because she has a boyfriend, so technically, I guess, she's not doing anything.  And all of a sudden, Pauly D, like, taps her on the shoulder to look down,  and he's got his hand down his pants, and just shows her that he's got a pierced dick.  He just shows that his dick is pierced.  He goes, wow, you got a pierced dick.  It's like, normally...  Everybody's like, yeah, don't tell anyone.  You could charge with assault or something.  You're just like, look at this.  But JWoww's like, damn.  Someone's got to explain these stupid pet hamsters, too. 
[01:01:00]  It's the toy of the year everyone's trying to find.  The Zuzu.  Yeah, we'll talk about that after the break.  I don't know much about the Zuzu, but I guess it's really hard to get.  And it might be one of the dangerous toys, really.  Yes, they're saying it might be.  It's got a bunch of marbles in it that taste like candy.  It's made of lead.  Yeah.  Oh, let's go to Brian in Virginia.  Trying to get off this topic with some of these calls.  That range is coming off.  Hey, boys, what's going on?  How you doing?  Good, Brian.  Hey, Jimmy, I saw you down in Virginia Beach a couple weeks ago. 
[01:01:30]  You killed, man.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, so anyway, listen, I used to work at this water park down in Seaside Heights,  and the Greedos would come in, and they would only go on the rides that would guarantee  that their hair wouldn't get wet.  Well, what are you going to do?  I can't do that fucking ride.  I'm going to fuck my hair up.  So what's wrong with that?  Well, hey, you know, I can't blame them.  And then one time, there's this big ride that every time, you know, a girl with a skippy 
[01:02:00]  bathing suit would go down.  There was a car and a car and a car would fall off.  Dude, we were scrambling.  We were all trying to guard for that particular ride.  Just so you can see it.  We're kind of losing you, but we got the gist of your call.  If you had perfect hair, you're not going to go down a water slide and mess it up,  because you've got to go to the club after the water park.  Well, you've got all that gel, though.  I'm saying it's perfect.  Doesn't the water bounce off your hair if you've got that much gel in it?  Nah, it just activates it.  There's no guarantees.  Danny in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. 
[01:02:30]  Danny.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah.  Co-heels really a new term.  They used to be called coo-jeans going back, growing up in Brooklyn and cruising down  like 86th Street.  Co-jean is the old term.  That's right.  That's everybody, though, in Bay Ridge.  You know, back in the 80s, everyone used to cruise down 86th Street with the Cadillac  and the disco ball in their car.  Disco ball.  Paulie D. is still rocking the Cadillac, and as if having the Cadillac car wasn't enough, 
[01:03:00]  he's got the Cadillac logo, the full-text Cadillac tattooed down the entire side of his  body.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, yeah.  From his armpit all the way down his fucking hip.  He tattooed Cadillac on a...  Why would you do that?  It's massive.  Because he drives a Cadillac.  Unless Cadillac paid you.  No, he paid to have, like, multi-millions of dollars to do that.  Because the girls will look at him in a club, he'll take his shirt off, he's looking all  muscular, all tan, perfect hair, plus they're like, damn, he drives a Cadillac? 
[01:03:30]  Well, you know.  He's advertising.  Exactly.  That's right, I drive a fucking Cadillac.  I guess for the rest of his life, he can't drive anything but Cadillac, so that could be a  Why would he?  That's what the girls like, Cadillacs.  That's classy.  Yeah.  It's a little more classier than some of the other clients.  A little more classier.  I hope Cadillac becomes the car of the faggot.  Oh, no.  That would be rough.  That would have a problem.  I think he would have a little bit of a problem there.  Hey, don't tell me, come on.  I drive a Cadillac.  Whoa, whoa, what are you saying?  Yeah, but you don't have...  Cadillac.  Yeah, but you don't have the Cadillac tattoo, so if the car is not cool anymore, who cares? 
[01:04:00]  You don't have a tattoo.  I'm waiting to get the situation going here.  You should jaw your hair in.  I got the situation going.  You should jaw your hair.  I've jelled my hair.  No, I mean, like, out like that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had a situation going on this morning.  Yeah?  In that bathroom.  Oh, in the bathroom.  I had a situation.  I hope he had called the situation where he's laying snake in the fucking bowl.  He smirched his name like that.  We all have a situation.  First break, I guess. 
[01:04:30]  We got lawman clips.  We got, I don't know, Danny, you brought this in?  Guy's wife cries at Back to the Future 3 and Star Wars?  Yeah, somebody had sent it to me on my Twitter.  I didn't know what to think of it when I first saw it, but the minute I watched the first video, I was laughing hysterically.  All right, cool.  Is it a visual or is it?  No, I think it works with audio.  Good, good to hear.  Then we'll talk about that dumb pet hamster that's the toy of the year, I guess.  I don't know.  We've got to be informed.  And when we get back, we're going to talk about this tiger shit.  What the fuck? 
[01:05:00]  He's just a pig.  This guy's just a pig.  That's what it comes down to.  Let's go to the Jersey Shore.  Do you think it's going to start affecting things?  His sponsorship?  Oh, yeah.  Now?  See?  I was saying that.  I think it's...  Let's get into it after the break.  We'll start fresh with the tire stuff.  And also remind me, Hulk Hogan wants his toilet back.  He's not happy.  Why?  You thought your divorce was bad, Ed.  Holy shit. 
[01:05:30]  Fucking Hulk is going through hell.  Oh, yeah.  Stormtrooper?  How do I set this up?  You guys said we need a little setup on this?  Stormchaser?  I mean, Italian stormchaser?  Yeah, just because it just kind of starts.  I don't even remember it.  It was just what Italian guys would sound like if they were stormchasers, pretty much.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's probably all I really need.  Let's check this out as we go to break.  It was Brooklyn.  They don't see tornadoes.  Hey, I'm a storm chaser.  Yeah, the Brooklyn storm chasers.  Hey.  We chase him in IROC Z's. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, Kaminoosh.  I'm detecting an F2 on the Fujita scale.  Hey, let's go out and get some Fujitas.  With some galamah.  Some galamah.  I was eating my galamah.  And I see a tornado coming.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  F5.  Forget about it. 
[01:06:30]  Bird in Philly.  An F2 is the finger of Rich Voss.  It's nothing.  Nothing.  There's nothing going on with the F2.  I'm sitting there in Brooklyn.  This tornado comes screaming through my neighborhood.  I'm like, you know, hey, I don't mind the tornado as long as the stay out of the neighborhood.  And we don't need that.  You know, this tornado does enough damage.  We don't need the f***ing f***s coming in here. 
[01:07:00]  I heard something that sounded like a, what do you call it, a freight train or something.  Came right down the street.  I'm trying to eat my galamah.  America!  My galamah.  I thought a bunch of f***ing f***s were coming over from the Bronx or something.  I reckon a joint.  And then the roof comes off my house.  Hey! 
[01:07:30]  Let's go storm chasing.  Hey, extreme, man!  Hey, yeah!  Come on, get in.  Get Maria.  Get Maria.  Because if she's f***ing hanging around here when a f***ing tornado comes through,  I don't want to hear about it.  And I got to get my car out of the way.  Because if this f***ing thing gets scratched, I'm going to be pissed.  Hey, Kaminoosh.  Got you the Yankee tickets?  Are they safe?  I will go to the game tonight. 
[01:08:00]  The hell is that music?  Oh, this is from Twister.  Come on.  This was the big, uh, the big get in Twister.  Van Halen's human being.  Yeah?  You got any Sinatra?  I like chasing tornadoes to Sinatra.  It scares the f***s away.  Yeah.  Here's the official story on the tornado in Brooklyn.  It was a freak tornado Wednesday morning wreaking havoc on homes and cars in Brooklyn 
[01:08:30]  and trashing streets four blocks.  At this Bay Ridge car dealership on 66th Street and 5th Avenue,  in a matter of minutes, the rooftop and awning were ripped off  and trees yanked out by the roots.  The worst of the storm brought winds of 135 miles an hour amid a furious thunderstorm  and three and a half inches of rain just after 6.30 in the morning.  This is the first tornado believed to have hit New York in more than a century. 
[01:09:00]  Say, just after 6.30 in the morning.  Oops.  What were we doing at 6.30 in the morning?  We let Brooklyn down yesterday.  Sorry, Brooklyn.  Sorry, Brooklyn.  Tornadoes howling through.  Howling through.  And we're giving our bonds commentary.  Oh, we suck sometimes.  Opie and Anthony.  I go to bed.  I think Tiger was up to five broads. 
[01:09:30]  I wake up.  It's up to, I think, nine.  Amazing.  You need a scorecard.  You're right.  I think at this point, Tiger Woods, he's damaged goods as far as sponsorships go.  Especially in the world of golf.  The world of golf is a little more highbrow, a little more class.  I think this definitely hurts the sponsorships for the next few years.  Well, I think, didn't ABC do something? 
[01:10:00]  What did they do?  I don't know.  Oh, no, no, what they did, I'll tell you.  It was the Tiger Woods golf tournament over the weekend that he was supposed to be at.  And, of course, he wasn't there because of the injuries.  Bullshit.  And usually they said there's a commercial, a Tiger Woods commercial, every commercial break.  Every commercial break, yeah.  And there were none.  He appeared in a PGA image ad, I think, or a couple of those.  It's pretty much a montage of, I believe, PGA golfers.  But besides that, no Tiger Woods commercials during his own fucking tournament. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, what's that about?  So they're all just kind of pulling their stuff for now to see what the hell happens.  Here's the deal.  Tiger, he's a pig.  He's a pig.  He shouldn't be married.  He wants all these broads.  And I think what happened with this guy is he was playing golf at a very young age.  He never had a chance to fucking get the pussy out there.  So then he gets famous and wealthy and whatnot, and he's getting the pussy now.  Now he's getting it.  He never got to do this naturally like most guys do growing up because he had hit 10,000 golf balls a day or whatever the fuck it was. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, you don't play golf like that if you're out fucking every night.  You think his father was going to allow him to date when he had golf balls to hit?  No.  How many balls did he hit a day when he was growing up?  I forgot the number.  It was something insane.  It was just insane.  His workout schedule with his dad.  Ridiculous, actually.  So he never really got to be a kid or a teenager or a young adult.  Because, I mean, he started winning tournaments in, what, PGA tournaments when he was 19, 20, something like that, 21, somewhere around there. 
[01:11:30]  So why did he hook up with this fucking, you know, buxom blonde?  Well, TMZ is reporting, alleged mistress, Tiger said marriage is a sham.  Tiger Woods told one of his alleged mistresses his marriage was a sham.  It's only for publicity, this according to her lawyer.  So, you know, this is through a lawyer.  Here's what happened with that.  She goes, aren't you married?  He goes, that's a sham, it's for publicity.  He probably said that to shut her up so he could fuck her. 
[01:12:00]  Because she was putting out that phony, we shouldn't be doing this, you're married thing.  And she needed to be, like, told it was okay to fuck a married guy.  So he probably just said, ah, nah, it's a sham, it's for publicity.  And she went, okay.  That's probably how that went.  Well, I think we got the list of mistresses right here.  Let's see.  Hey, wait, you're married, aren't you?  It's just a sham.  Okay.  Well, this one broad doesn't seem too smart.  This Jamie Junger, the one in Vegas, the second, I think she was the second one. 
[01:12:30]  Is it a J?  It's a J, it's probably younger.  It's probably younger.  Yeah, you're right.  Here's what they're reporting.  The list of mistresses.  Team Tiger may be sitting with their tail between their legs as the list of women connected to Tiger Woods continues to grow.  The latest edition, Chelsea resident Corey Rist.  She reportedly hooked up with a married golfer after meeting him on the Manhattan club scene.  All on the wrist.  Then there's Mindy Lawton, a Pancake House waitress from Orlando who says she was dumped by Woods in 2007. 
[01:13:00]  Add to that Jamie Grubbs, the cocktail waitress and Tool Academy star.  Next up, New York nightclub hostess Rachel Yucatel.  Kalika Moquin, a Las Vegas club manager, also allegedly hooked up with Woods.  All clubs.  And then there's Jamie Jungers, an employer of Trashy Girls, a lingerie line and entertainment agency.  Also, a few women who want to remain anonymous, including a former Orlando, Florida cocktail waitress and a sexy British TV broadcaster.  For once, my pronunciation was right. 
[01:13:30]  Unless hers was wrong.  I'm completely mad.  Then I should shut my fucking trap.  Wow, a pancake waitress.  It ran the gamut, huh?  He really did.  He didn't care what you did.  As long as you had an apron on, he'd put his dick in.  Could you give me that?  Sure could.  That's what a good boy Tiger is.  I think...  Man.  I mean, I think if he cheated once, I think he gets through that very easily.  But, I mean, how many girls did they just list?  Was that close to nine?  3,445.  Yeah, now he's just looking like, you know... 
[01:14:00]  That's just showing that image that we all thought was complete bullshit.  The tiger image is complete bullshit.  And I think that's what's going to be the problem with sponsorships.  I don't know.  Maybe you're right, but...  One person, you go, ah, you know, I'm fucking human, blah, blah, blah.  And you kind of, you say sorry, and then you're a good boy, and you move on.  And then, you know, about six months later, the sponsorships come back strong.  He'll do a mea culpa, because Oprah's already contacted you.  He ain't doing shit.  He'll go on, listen to what he's going to go on, Oprah. 
[01:14:30]  He's going to talk about it, look, I was this, I was going to come clean.  Because people are suckers for that.  I'm telling you, when you...  What is he going to be able to say?  He's going to have to say he's a sex addict.  Whatever he says, look, I was...  Which isn't true either.  He just wanted pussy.  There is a difference.  I didn't experience certain things as a young man.  However he phrases it, he's not a pedophile.  He's not a violent guy.  Like, he hasn't done anything criminal.  Every man understands why he did what he did.  No one's underage.  There's no drug allegations. 
[01:15:00]  If that stuff doesn't happen, I think he'll be fine.  He might lose a couple, but he'll pick them up other places.  Fucking Nike is Nike.  Guys fucking mostly buy Nike because it's high ground chicks.  I don't think it destroys his career, but it definitely hurts it a bit.  Yeah, he's going to have to get through this one.  Yeah, I think he will.  And then what's the S&M thing?  Woods S&M bombshell revealed.  Why is that a bombshell, though?  Why is that a bombshell that he likes?  Does he like to be tied up or something? 
[01:15:30]  Who cares?  Let's find out.  What was he like?  I'm going to read every single word of this article.  Tiger Woods avoids the rough on the golf course, but not in the bedroom.  Right.  God, the fucking puns.  Holy shit with the puns.  Oh, mommy, you don't want to know.  Turn off your radio, mommy.  What happened?  No, we can't tell you what your boy was up to in this one.  What happened?  No, no, go back in the house.  What does he like it?  How does he like it?  Sometimes, I looked like a rag doll after we'd made love, said Mindy Lawton, 33, a busty 
[01:16:00]  Florida brunette who gushed about the well-endowed golfing greats penchant for marathon S&M romps  in an exclusive interview.  S&M romps.  The greasy spoon worker claimed that the steamy year-long affair began while Woods' model wife  was pregnant and that they conducted their extramarital trysts in the Tiger Woods mansion.  Ah.  Right in the fucking mansion.  He really did like it rough, said Lawton, who became the latest, all right, whatever. 
[01:16:30]  That's a big house when your pregnant wife can hang around and you could just be fucking  in another part of the house.  What is that about?  Holy shit.  He also owns another house down the road or something in that same development I was  reading.  I bet the Woods' closet is a lot bigger than mine was.  The Woods' closet is a whole house.  You can't do that in my house.  He really did like it rough.  She claims a 33-year-old golfer got off on Dirty Talk, but that his favorite fetish was  tugging her trusses. 
[01:17:00]  Really?  What is that?  What are trusses?  He likes hair pulling.  He likes to pull her hair.  But it was asshole hair.  That's what makes it weird.  Dude, what's better than a fucking, when you wrap asshole hair around your fist and  lift them up by their middle?  I love a fistful of asshole hair.  And you lift her up like London Bridge.  Or wrap it around a few times and it looks like twine.  The way Pesci wrapped that thing around his hand in Raging Bull, that's how I wrap asshole  hair around my hand.  That's great. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, he was a dominant guy.  Good for him.  Yeah, so he, okay, he wanted to spank me and loved pulling my hair as we had sex.  He also liked me to talk dirty to him, but hair pulling was what really turned him on.  Lawton said the world's richest athlete has an insatiable appetite for getting it on.  For getting it on.  Getting it on.  He has a very strong sex drive and knows his way around the bedroom. 
[01:18:00]  There's a bed.  What guy doesn't know his way around a bedroom?  David Patterson?  Good point.  On a scale of 10.  Well, he knows his way around a bedroom, but he holds his skillet and tries to cook.  His stove is soft and cushy.  That's a pillow, sir.  On a scale of 10, I would give him a 12.  That's not a scale of 10, whore.  Dummy.  I hate that 1 to 10 shit, and then you give him 11 or 12. 
[01:18:30]  Exactly.  It goes to 10.  Get it?  So you're a 10.  Maybe she means a 1.2.  Us goes to 12.  If it was early in the morning and Tiger was going away for a tournament, he would call  me up for quick urgent sex, and I was happy to oblige.  Of course.  Lawton said they met in 2006 while she was working as a manager at Perkins.  At where?  Perkins.  He's a billionaire.  Eating at Perkins.  What a chiseler.  Wow. 
[01:19:00]  And she worked at Perkins.  A chain eater.  We know what it is.  A chain eatery in Orlando, it says.  At the early morning golf practice, he would call the diner to order breakfast.  Usually, he was ordering breakfast from Perkins?  Egg white almond with broccoli and orange juice.  I mean, Perkins is good after you've been drinking all night.  When you're scoping out the fucking chick to be fucking, that's probably his main motive.  I bet she never ate it.  He would pick up the food and dump it in the garbage and then have his cook make him a real omelet.  Of course, he never ate it. 
[01:19:30]  He's half black.  Oh, the breakfast.  Okay, I thought you meant something.  Usually, egg white omelet with broccoli and orange juice.  Jesus, you want to talk about farts.  And he even brought his wife to pick up the breakfast at Perkins.  The first time I saw him, he had a baseball cap pulled over his eyes.  She said, I was a little starstruck and helped the service at his table.  We didn't speak, but made eye contact.  After a month, he would call and ask to speak directly to her, invite her for cocktails at his favorite bar, the Blue Martini.  Yeah.  Local joint in Orlando. 
[01:20:00]  Spelled B-L-E-W.  And Martini was Danny DeVito from Cuckoo's Nest.  I knew he was married, but whenever he had come into the restaurant with his wife, he looked so miserable.  They didn't talk and never held hands.  There was no affection there.  But I didn't feel bad about seeing a married man.  As to me, it was just a drink.  Their relationship quickly heated up.  The first time they had sex was on his couch during a late night at his mansion.  Where the fuck is the wife?  Yeah, really?  I mean, you're making those jokes, but she had a... 
[01:20:30]  Where is she?  She may have been fucking on a shopping thing in Paris or in Italy or wherever wives go when husbands want to fuck Perkins waitresses.  It probably wasn't a mansion.  It was probably a room at one of those fucking awful hotel...  Where the doors are on the parking lot?  Something suites.  You know what I mean?  An embassy suites room, which he thought was his mansion.  And then he just had 500 guests and all their cars were outside.  A quality in.  Yeah, she didn't know.  She was dumb.  Perkins, pussy. 
[01:21:00]  Okay.  He started to strip off my clothes and I took off his, she said.  We were sitting on a brown sofa and within seconds we were both naked.  As a sportsman, he's in great shape, but he's also very well endowed.  Tiger's got a piece.  The sex left her completely drained.  That first time he was very dominant.  Him the same way.  And knew what he wanted and what he was doing, she said.  I wonder if he bags it.  Because, man, that would be inexpensive.  I bet you he does.  Either that or he probably just pulls out and makes cumsies all over her eagles. 
[01:21:30]  Whatever the golf term I can't think of.  All over her birdie ruffs.  Her birdie ruffs.  Fucking dumb golf puns.  And he cums all over her carts.  All over her green.  Yeah.  Gives it to her on her sand trap.  Turns her over.  He yanks the hair out of her sand trap.  That's the Perkins broad?  That's the clown.  Oh, that's a different shot.  That one is ugly.  That's the first ugly one.  He threw an ugly one in the mix, huh? 
[01:22:00]  Over the course of the year-long whatever, they had sex in five different rooms.  Dalliance.  Oh, yeah, dalliance.  Five?  Ooh, cut.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  I don't care.  No, I was in five different rooms.  They had sex in five different rooms in his home, she said.  They also exchanged dirty text messages.  All Tiger cared about was getting me into bed, she said.  He had an urge, and I satisfied it.  There was very little emotion from his side, although I fell for him.  Of course you did.  This is called a guy.  A guy.  He was just getting rid of the poison, you dumb whore.  It's the marriage part that is, you know, if he wasn't married, this would just be, wow, 
[01:22:30]  Tiger's fucking, fucking.  One of the last times the two hooked up was a quickie in a church parking lot.  Tiger wanted to have sex on the back seat, but it wasn't comfortable.  But he was desperate, insisted that we do it up against the side of the car.  Oh.  Jesus.  By 2007, no.  You look like that.  Wood stopped returning her phone calls, because he found another broad.  Yep.  He was bouncing from broad to broad.  Deep.  She said the experience left her bitter.  Tiger just used me as his sex toy.  No shit, you should have known that from the beginning. 
[01:23:00]  What the fuck?  I don't know, read the last line.  How smart this broad is.  I thought I meant something to him, but all he cared about was lust.  He is a selfish, heartless man.  You were fucking a married man in his house.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Exactly.  You knew what you were.  Know what it is.  It is what it is.  He is, any guy that cheats is selfish, fair enough, but you knew what he was.  You were fucking him in his house.  Right.  Shut up.  You fucked him in God's fucking parking lot. 
[01:23:30]  Do you understand?  God's driveway.  You fucked him against a car while the Lord looked on.  You fucking, getting more info.  Oh, this is unbelievable right here.  Jason in Virginia.  Not going to believe this one.  Yes, Jason.  Hey, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Hey, man.  Hey, Opie, I read the same article I thought, but it sounds a little different.  It said that he came in there so she could read the news and information to him off the  back of the placemat, and that she eventually had to meet him because she chased him out and  he didn't leave a tip.  Oh, he didn't tip. 
[01:24:00]  Wow, dude.  You fucked up your joke.  Because they're chasing him in a restaurant.  See, it says the reason they met was because she had to chase him out of the restaurant  because he did not leave a tip.  You said, get it because the ends don't tip.  I know.  I think you just messed it up a little bit.  That's all.  Hey, we got Anonymous checking in.  We love when Anonymous calls the show.  Anonymous.  Hello, boys.  How are you today?  Good, Anonymous.  What do you got for the show?  Just want to let you know that I wanted this to be exclusive.  I ran into Tiger Woods, their club in New York City. 
[01:24:30]  He approached me and started flirting with me a little bit.  And what we did was we left and went to my apartment.  And I just said, Tiger, I want you to drive those balls deep inside of me.  And that's where he proceeded to give me the Hoover.  Who was he supposed to be?  Anonymous.  Oh, okay.  Sorry, man.  He doesn't want his real name out there.  It's Anonymous.  This is Anonymous.  This is an exclusive Anonymous, my relations with Tiger Woods, where he got me good. 
[01:25:00]  The Samoan Pile Driver, all of that.  Could you just work the word gurney into this, please?  Um, no.  No.  All right.  Maybe the next anonymous caller will.  Met and gurney.  You know, powdered cocaine and crack cocaine.  Yeah.  I am most shocked that he got his food from Perkins.  No kidding.  No kidding.  More than anything else in this story.  I don't think I've eaten in a Perkins since my Buffalo days.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know this.  Tim in New Bedford. 
[01:25:30]  Tim.  What's that?  That's you, Tim.  What up?  Yes.  Yeah.  I wanted to tell R&A about Tiger Woods' signature move called the divot, where he's making out  with a chick.  He gets his hand on their pants and yells, four, and rips out a handful of pubic hair.  Jesus.  That's funny.  The divot.  He ripped it out.  I like the fact that he puts his hand down her pants, so she's still dressed and standing  there and he just yanks it out.  Yields forward.  And then you've got to throw it like a divot. 
[01:26:00]  Well, that wouldn't make a divot now, would it?  Yeah, there's a lip stuck to it.  Please replace divots.  It's a big mess-a-ro.  Let's go to Chris in Vegas.  Chris, fill it with some sand.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Chris.  Happy birthday, Yini.  Happy birthday.  Hey, I just wanted to see, I just got my new Golf Digest in the mail, and on the front  cover, it shows Obama kneeling down in front of Tiger, and it says, top ten things that  Obama can learn from Tiger.  Let me explain something.  Wow, really?  Obama has the worst luck ever.  The latest issue of Golf Digest, this guy's correct, and there was an article on it, because 
[01:26:30]  Golf Digest was like, look, we have to announce to the world, it's too late to pull this thing.  This went into print three months ago.  It's coming out now.  We don't know what to do.  And sure enough, on newsstands, you can see Obama and Tiger Woods on the cover of fucking  Golf Digest.  Oh, there it is.  And Tiger hasn't been on a cover in a while, either.  Nope.  Not a perfect timing.  Nope.  I'm so happy they have it.  Now, did they just put Obama's picture there?  It looks like it's the real guy.  It looks like they're both looking at a fine set of fucking, you know, little legs or pussy 
[01:27:00]  or something.  They did not get the president to squat while they did a photo.  No.  The Tigers went Obama's caddy in that shot, huh?  All right.  That's Photoshop.  Let me say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris?  Well, I'm not going to attempt my divot joke now.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, that divot joke was too good.  I'm not even trying mine.  This is probably why guys like Phil Mickelson and some of the other established guys in the 
[01:27:30]  truck hate fucking Tiger because they knew he was a lie.  Wow.  You know what?  Yeah, there's a lot of guys.  You always thought it was a jealousy thing, but they probably also were like, what the fuck?  This guy's banging broads all over the place and nobody knows except we know because  we're so close to him.  He's making $8 million a year on endorsements and he's living the fucking lie.  Yeah.  And Phil Mickelson was a stand-up guy, you know, gets a bad rap because, you know, he  gives Tiger a rash and his shit all the time. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  I don't think Tiger was.  I think the bottom line is Clinton did it.  Fucking Spitzer did it.  Too many men in power have done it.  It's not.  Again, there's no pedophilia.  It's not like he's blowing guys in a rest area.  He's a fucking guy.  See what else surfaces.  Well, yeah.  I'm with Anthony, not yet.  I don't think this is over by any means, man.  He's just having...  And everybody's lawyering up.  And the thing I read today in the paper, you know, these girls are being contacted by Tiger's  lawyer ahead of time.  Yeah, probably for...  They're trying to make deals left and right to make this go away. 
[01:28:30]  Settlements.  Yeah, I'll blame him.  I mean, you know...  And Opie, you know, you pay attention to golf.  Like Camilo Vegas, that guy's going to make a shitload of money on endorsements now that  he's in that fresh face.  Yep.  Tiger's money's fucking gone, man.  Well, it's definitely gone for the, you know...  Yeah, he'll take a year off.  No, he won't take a year off.  No, not a year, but I'm saying the endorsements will be a little weird for a year.  Oh, yeah, the endorsements will be a little weird for a year.  I don't think everyone bails on Tiger.  They shouldn't. 
[01:29:00]  But I think he loses a few biggies.  At least that's winning more tournaments.  But who cares?  He's a billionaire.  I don't care.  I can't wait for the golf season now.  I can't wait.  He's half a billionaire now.  And what is Tiger going to do?  I don't think he talks to the media because the media really, you know, fucked him.  Oh, they're just going to keep asking, hey, what about these allegations of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?  Well, that's why he'll do a mea culpa on fucking Oprah because then he can say, look, that's in the past.  I've discussed that.  That's probably the best thing he can do. 
[01:29:30]  Because Oprah will be a friendly place for him to go.  Yep.  Oprah ain't going to get hard on his ass.  No.  And he'll be able to...  Maybe he just doesn't say anything.  No.  Maybe he'll always question him.  Maybe he's one of these guys who will just ignore it right to the end and just keep just fucking playing golf.  He can't be.  A lot of the guys in the floor are already saying he should just come out and play and keep his fucking mouth shut.  No, he'll have to...  I'm telling you, just to shut the media up, he doesn't owe anybody an explanation.  But in order to shut the fucking media up, he'll have to say, look, I've addressed that. 
[01:30:00]  Because then you'll look stupid when you ask him a redundant question.  He'll be like, I addressed that.  He's got to do damage control.  And you're right.  He's got to do a mocking mea culpa out there somewhere.  Yes.  Stop stealing my truth.  And it's best that is a one-shot deal.  Someone is asking, I don't have time to go to him, how many of these stories are bullshit.  There's too many of them coming out.  That doesn't even matter at this point.  Exactly.  Why would you want to get sued by Tiger for fucking lying?  I mean, if there's close to nine women out there, if one or two are bullshit, there's still, you know, seven women. 
[01:30:30]  You had to know that three was just the tip of the iceberg.  I mean, let's face it.  I said it when the Rachel girl came out and lured it up.  Then I'm like, wow, this is going to get really ugly.  There's a lot more shit under the water.  And she doesn't want to talk at all because she's saying it's a lot bigger than Tiger, whatever the fuck that means.  She said that?  Something like that, yeah.  Maybe him and Jeter would have threesomes with her and they'd all giggle, watch Met games.  Who knows?  Maybe, I don't know.  I don't even want to speculate.  Maybe there's another woman in there. 
[01:31:00]  Thank you, Chris.  Let's go to Bill in PA.  Bill?  Yeah, you think he had to explain the shit on his dick by saying he played the back nine?  Jesus.  All right.  A boob.  A boob.  I sort of liked it.  It needs just a little tweaking.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Oh, yes.  You're from Jersey.  He doesn't like to do clumsies in the hall.  He likes to leave it on the fringe.  Watch it out.  Oh, we got a soccer mom checking in. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  I love when the soccer moms call the show.  I do, too.  Let's say hi to soccer mom.  Soccer mom.  Your wife should never let you watch Tiger a bit.  It's despicable how women are just shit upon these days.  Well, we can't hear you.  Could you just start over?  Yeah, right.  The soccer mom bit has potential. 
[01:32:00]  I'll just say that much.  Yeah, if someone else does it.  Well, of course.  Oh, that was horrid.  Let's go to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Hey, morning, Stryker.  Twice last week, I think it was Monday and Wednesday, CNBC was interviewing some of the  PR people with some of Tiger's various sponsors, and most of them kind of were hinting that  his sponsorships are fine as long as there is nothing illegal involved.  Exactly.  What he was doing.  So, I think, you know, like Oaks said, he might lose one or two, but I think for the 
[01:32:30]  most part, they're all just going to say, you know what, he's a guy, fucking probably  half the guys out there are like right on.  Their answer will be it's a personal matter between him and his wife.  It's a family matter.  They'll say it like that.  Yeah.  I just, I don't think we have all the info.  I think this gets uglier.  Yeah, but I think as long as there's nothing illegal involved.  Oh, yeah, sure. 
[01:33:00]  I understand that point.  Oh, some fucking companies.  Yeah.  Procter Gamble.  Yeah, things like that.  I mean, I'm trying to think of other things I've seen him do commercials for besides just  like Cadillac.  Well, the sports stuff, whatever.  But I think you're right.  There's other, yeah.  You know, because they do have like, they're really into the family image.  Yeah, yeah.  And they want to protect that, these big companies.  And they just don't want to, or maybe even temporarily, but it's going to affect it somehow.  You know, hey, until the heat blows over, we're not going to run these fucking Tiger 
[01:33:30]  Woods spots.  Sure.  When everyone will just see it and equate our product.  You know what?  With some pig who likes fucking whores.  This came out in a perfect time, though, because the golf season is pretty much over.  Yeah.  Starts up again in, well, we got a couple months off now.  So, in a couple months, we'll be on to tell the stories, and maybe nothing happens at  that point.  What happened with SNL?  Yeah, let's talk about that.  I guess I've got to start watching SNL again.  People are saying this.  No, don't subject yourself to that. 
[01:34:00]  But SNL criticized, you can't criticize SNL ever.  It's a comedy show.  But when you look at where the criticism comes from, this is just somebody trying to make  a story.  Look at where the criticism, it's like some blogger on the fucking Huffington Post.  It's just a few little douches.  SNL criticized after airing Tiger Woods, but it's all over TV now.  Oh, is it on TV?  So, this fucking blogger got everyone's attention.  Did it really start with the blogger?  I don't know.  Maybe not.  I've seen it.  We have eight TVs in here, and I've seen it on three or four already. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, good for SNL.  SNL criticized after airing Tiger Woods' domestic violence skit while...  Well, Rihanna on show.  So?  Who cares?  Exactly.  How about you criticize her for fucking dating a guy who did that?  Right.  Saturday Night Live is making headlines for featuring a skit over the weekend, which  parodied domestic violence.  On Saturday night's episode, the NBC sketch comedy show made light of Tiger Woods' scandalous  week, satirizing reports denied by the golfer that his wife, Ilan, or whatever, attacked 
[01:35:00]  him prior to his early morning car accident with a sketch featuring Kenan Thompson.  And Blake Lively.  However, the show's musical guest was Rihanna, a victim of domestic violence.  That's just bad timing.  Yeah, too bad.  Then, you know what?  I bet you they sat Rihanna down and said, look, you know what?  We're doing this skit.  We just want to let you know.  I guarantee they made sure she was okay with it.  A victim of domestic violence earlier this year from her boyfriend, then-boyfriend Chris  Brown, prompting concerns from several media outlets that the show's humor was insensitive 
[01:35:30]  from some corner.  Oh, good.  Good.  Be sensitive with your humor.  Here we go.  It was another sketch that gave us pause.  Who said that?  Pop Eater.  What is Pop Eater?  Pop Eater is pretty fucking big.  What is it, though?  What is Pop Eater besides mom?  It's an entertainment website.  It's sort of like an edgier people, I would say.  Exactly.  Shit.  Kind of in between people and TMZ, I guess would be the way to explain that. 
[01:36:00]  Gave us pause.  Noted Pop Eater in an article titled, SNL Lampoons Alleged Violence in Tiger Woods' Marriage.  Good.  We think, had the genders been reversed, SNL wouldn't make light of the potentially violent  situation.  So what?  Maybe they're right, but so on.  They're probably right about that, if I think about it.  Female-oriented site, Jezebel.  Now, that one I don't know.  Called the sketch one of the show's obvious missteps when you consider that Rihanna was  the night's musical guest.  They didn't surprise Rihanna with this. 
[01:36:30]  Rihanna knew what was going on on the show.  Not a misstep.  It's like, again, her personal life, she had nothing to do with their fucking, with  their humor on that show.  Who watched SNL?  I need to know, when was the skit and when did Rihanna perform?  Because if she performed after the skit, then she was totally fine with it.  Apparently.  Because she could have walked.  She didn't walk.  Right.  She knew beforehand.  She knew, though.  I mean, what these people are stupid.  They do those rehearsals and shit.  They know.  While over on the TV squad blog.  The TV squad.  You don't like the TV squad blog. 
[01:37:00]  Well, bloggers, the fact that they're taken seriously.  Getting all this credibility.  It's just silly.  They're just fucking, most of them are just nerds.  Not all of them.  Most of them are just nerds with nerd sensibilities.  Dude, the local news just now, as you were talking, did a montage of all the Tiger Woods  girls.  It went on forever.  And then they faded to black like it was the Oscars.  Like it was the death montage.  See, once again, this is another example of fucking humor.  Getting shit.  But no one has criticized the news for capitalizing completely on this. 
[01:37:30]  Or any Jezebel didn't criticize themselves.  The TV squad did for showing the photos of the car action.  Did she beat him?  The curiosity was fine.  But don't address it with humor.  It's so silly.  Well, let's see what the TV squad blog said.  As soon as this sketch started, I immediately thought, oh, no.  Stop the sketch.  Rihanna might see.  Is that serious? 
[01:38:00]  I swear to God.  Come on now.  Adding, had the tables been turned and a man was suspected of beating up his wife, there  definitely wouldn't be a lighthearted sketch like this.  But since it's female on male domestic violence, our current culture deems it kind of sort of  okay to make fun of.  And the scandal had to be addressed before it lost heat.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It is kind of, you know, people do find it funny when a woman beats up a man like that.  I want to see Invictus just to look at Morgan Freeman's horrible accent.  Stinks.  It does look bad.  Entertainment Weekly and the Huffington Post raised their voices over the sketch. 
[01:38:30]  Entertainment Weekly is abysmal.  The Tiger Woods sketch was terrible.  Domestic abuse is not funny.  To you.  To you.  But that's why you make fun of it.  A lot of people think that's funny.  That's why you make fun.  Like, people, no one says the real situation is funny.  Making fun of something or address it in humor doesn't mean that you think the reality with  the humor removed is funny.  God, what a country of jizz bags. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, we got to, we got to, hold on, hold on to the statement until I'm done.  That's very interesting.  Thanks.  Good find, Travis.  Uh, uh, there was, okay, it's not funny.  It was even more awkward since Rihanna was there.  Emotional and physical violence is toxic and not funny.  The lipstick femme wrote.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Hey, good for SNL.  They're getting a lot of fucking ink this season.  Yep, they better not apologize.  You were cursing and on SNL and now you got this skit. 
[01:39:30]  A lot of attention for SNL.  Good for them.  Uh, uh, Travis just gave us a statement from 2007.  Meanwhile, as Vic awaits his December 10th sentencing, almost two years ago, right?  And so this was two years ago, uh, Tiger Woods had this to say.  If you made that big a mistake, you've got to come out and just be contrite, be honest,  and just tell the public that I was wrong, what's told ESPN.  And I think waiting a long time got a lot of people polarized.  I just think if he would have come out earlier, he would have diffused a little more of it. 
[01:40:00]  But it's totally disconnected because Vic was a fucking, was a barbaric scumbag and he was a criminal.  That was criminal shit with death in it and cruelty.  This is just the guy getting laid.  Hey, man, enough time goes by.  It doesn't matter.  Vic fucking played in Atlanta over the weekend and they were cheering him on.  Of course.  By the end of the game, they were, they had chants of, we want Vic and everything.  Yeah.  And he's hugging people that he knew from his Atlanta days.  Oh, it was a big homecoming.  Turned out to be a great homecoming for Michael Vick. 
[01:40:30]  That's great.  Good, good for him.  It's all bullshit in the end.  It really is.  All nerds to him.  Oh, God.  I just want to read bloggers' blogs now.  What fucking nerds?  What nerd empowerment bloggers?  What was the last one?  The lipstick femme?  Exactly.  My hair has got a kiss of my thing.  Oh, Sharon Osbourne checking in.  Oh.  It's been a while.  Hi, Sharon.  Sharon.  Hello, boys.  Hi, Sharon.  Hi, Sharon.  By the way, Michael Vick got rough for a touchdown and two for a touchdown. 
[01:41:00]  What do you mean?  Tiger Woods was hit with the horny stick, boys.  Yeah.  Right on.  You better apologize.  The horny stick.  I am sorry.  I don't have a nice Sharon Osbourne voice, but I do apologize.  I'll tell you.  You almost have a Tyson voice.  You might want to be our Mike Tyson caller.  Listen to that.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:41:30]  I didn't mean to do that.  By the way, yeah, Michael Vick did have two touchdowns.  He ran for one and threw one in there.  Ooh.  Let me say hi to Tom in Iowa.  Tom.  Hey, as Jimmy knows, an inch of a strap-on up your ass is not funny when it happens to you.  And Bobby from Facebook just writes, Tiger was, see, I can't do the voice.  Tiger was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a, I can't think of a golf term at the table. 
[01:42:00]  Players couldn't get any tees from the pro shop.  I don't know.  Could they get a fatter black guy to play Tiger Woods on SNL?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's the only guy they got.  That's the token.  Is it the one black guy?  Yes.  Why don't they put two black guys on SNL?  Because that would scare America, Jimmy.  You can't have two.  You can have one.  Oh, very good fucking, look at this, Graham.  Doing some math.  Go ahead, Graham. 
[01:42:30]  Good evening.  Hi, Graham.  Hey, I was thinking Tiger's dad must have been sporting a monster piece to counteract that little Korean Dick Gene  that his mom was carrying.  Yeah.  For Tiger to have an endowed penis, Tiger's daddy must have had a fucking Louisiana black snake in his pants.  Right on.  Have a good one.  All right, brother.  Yeah, because it could have went the other way for Tiger.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been embarrassing. 
[01:43:00]  Poor guy.  Oh, I didn't know this.  That's why he's getting so much fucking pussy.  He's rich and he's got a big cock.  Stig, what's up?  Hey, I hear VH1's going to be giving Tiger Woods his own dating show.  It's called 18 Holes of Love.  Punch it out, boys.  I just hope the number settles at 18.  That would be great.  All right.  Well, there's your Tiger update.  Tiger.  Wow.  Who knew?  Who would have thunk?  Yeah, that's... 
[01:43:30]  All those romantic pictures of him and his wife and the kid and we all went through the  pregnancy with them and he's just fucking, she's pregnant, he's fucking in their house.  Allegedly, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  One brud.  I don't think he's going to come out with a cease and desist on anybody at this point.  Dude, barrel, man.  No matter what the fuck you talk about as far as Tiger goes, I don't think he's going to  come to our show and go, oh, you were talking about me and you didn't say allegedly.  But Sam just handed in more from the Jersey Shore clips. 
[01:44:00]  Jesus.  We got more The Situation clips.  Great.  With Ronnie and Sammy.  Oh, fuck.  Are these good?  They're great.  All right.  I have to break more clips from The Jersey Shore.  My favorite show on TV right now as far as junk TV goes.  And then we find out about Hulk Hogan.  He just wants his toilet back.  He's not asking for money.  And we got clips from The Lawman, Steven Seagal.  Steven Seagal.  Yeah, I haven't watched it. 
[01:44:30]  Ant watches that one, right?  Oh, yeah.  Fantastic.  He's such a tool.  Can we get a moment of silence for Barrel Man?  Should we do it before or after the break?  How about during the break?  During the break?  Fuck Barrel Man.  How about we dramatically go to break with some silence for Barrel Man?  Of course, Barrel Man was that Denver Bronco guy who went to the Broncos games for the last  30 years with just the Barrel Man.  One of those guys?  You've seen it.  Oh, we've got to talk about Billy Joel's daughter for that cry for help crap that she did over 
[01:45:00]  the weekend.  Turns out the pills she OD'd on, whatever, would not kill you whatsoever.  It's like broccoli.  It's like she ate a lot of broccoli.  We might have to get Dr. Steve on the phone to explain, but she was rushed to the hospital,  OD, 911, blah, blah, blah.  She's troubled.  Coming out in the paper, what she took would not cause death.  She just panicked a little bit.  That's all.  Yeah.  She's a little troubled.  Yeah, it happens.  All right.  A moment of silence. 
[01:45:30]  Denver Broncos Barrel Man dies at age 69 after 30 years of going to games in a barrel.  Shh.  This is our moment of silence.  How many seconds do you do a moment of silence?  A moment.  I know, but 10 seconds.  But what's a moment?  10 seconds is a moment of silence.  That's too long.  Four seconds.  Just say whatever you want to say, we'll go.  It's Barrel Man.  Let's give him a half a second of silence.  All right.  Go.  Rest in.  Yeah.  Okay.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I know we're moving on from the Jesse Ventura-Jim Norton competition thing. 
[01:46:00]  That was big last week.  Yeah.  Big.  But a lot of people tweeted me this article over the weekend from the Baltimore Sun.  It's quick.  Was that from the actual paper or an online blog?  Kevin Eck blogs about pro wrestling.  He blogs.  Hell anymore.  Why are they giving credibility like that?  My take on Jesse Ventura walking off radio show.  Listen to this douchebag who's completely uninformed about what happened. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, of course.  And then commenting about it.  He writes, I haven't commented on the incident in which Jesse Ventura stormed off a satellite  radio show earlier this week because I really didn't want to give the show any more publicity.  Yeah.  Your blog is going to fucking give us so much great publicity.  The guy is a blogger and he's, what are you afraid, 40 more people are going to know my name, you silly goose?  Yeah, you piece of shit.  We were on CNN.  CNN is fucking international, you cock.  How many people read your stupid blog? 
[01:47:00]  So full of yourself, you idiot.  It doesn't want to give the show any more publicity.  Since several people have asked me about it, however, I'll give my opinion.  Why don't you just say you wanted to talk about it?  Of course.  Why?  Why?  You don't need to preface why you're giving an opinion.  Just say you want to talk about it and be heard.  It goes on.  Silly.  Uh, the name of the show in question is out there, but I'm not going to give the people  involved with the show the satisfaction of getting another mention in the press. 
[01:47:30]  Gee.  I'll give you fucking attention, Kevin Eck.  I feel so bad.  There you go.  You might get three more people to read your blog because I said your name.  Uh, that's exactly why they pull these kind of stunts.  Judging by that, you could probably guess which side I'm on.  No.  Look, we know how to get attention for this radio show.  Absolutely.  When Jesse Ventura walked in here, it wasn't our goal to get him to try to, like, punch 
[01:48:00]  somebody in this studio.  It just went down that way after about two hours.  Okay?  You fucking idiot.  How long was he on that day?  But then when something like that happens, yeah, we do know how to work the media and  make sure it gets out there and gets a lot of exposure for, uh, for us.  How long was he on that day?  Over an hour.  For over an hour, yeah.  I keep saying two hours because I think it was close to two hours.  And this is what, and this guy's not a journalist, he's a blogger, so he doesn't have the same  responsibility levels.  But what, you know, oh, you know who I really didn't like? 
[01:48:30]  I don't care about this guy, he's a nobody.  It was that guy Sanchez from CNN.  Oh, yeah, we got it from Sanchez, too.  Did you guys get the Sanchez audio from Friday?  You really should get it.  There's nothing worse to me than, journalists are just lazy.  They don't do their, it's like, man, if you're going to talk about something as a journalist,  listen to the entire bit of audio, you dummy.  Yeah, listen, uh...  What dummies?  We'll have the Sanchez audio, it's unbelievable.  I want to hear that.  He didn't even do the basic fucking research on the big show. 
[01:49:00]  What a shitty representation of the media.  He goes, uh, for those who don't know, Ventura appeared in studio on the show to promote his  new show.  The former governor of Minnesota ended up in a heated debate with some obnoxious comedian  who I've never heard of.  Yeah, sure.  You're fucking lying through your teeth.  If you're in the media, you kind of know who Jim Norton is at this point.  He's on Leno every other week, you idiot.  And if you don't know who I am, that's acceptable, too. 
[01:49:30]  He knows exactly who you are.  Why does it matter?  Like, if I'm arguing with somebody, what's the difference whether or not you know who  I am?  How does that come into play?  If this guy knows you or not.  Am I more validated if you know who I am?  It's irrelevant.  Stupid asshole.  It's the phoniness that really bothers me.  He knows who you are.  Uh, never heard about the government's possible involvement in 9-11 and whether the U.S.  should have gone to war.  In the five-minute clip that I saw on YouTube...  There you go.  That's right.  Thank you.  In that sentence... 
[01:50:00]  Sentence.  Yup.  He didn't check anything out in the five-minute clip I saw.  Right.  And like I said, it's safe to say Jesse was in here at least an hour and a half.  We should...  I hope we have the audio on your thing.  At least.  The entire audio should be a link up there.  Uh-huh.  No.  Uh-huh.  No.  No, because people don't have problems that I'm actually giving the listeners a little  extra for their fucking bang.  No.  I don't have that, Jimmy.  Okay.  It'll just cause major problems.  Maybe someone used mind control on him. 
[01:50:30]  Mind control.  Stop.  In the five-minute clip that I saw on YouTube, the comedian raised his voice even after Ventura  asked him to calm down, spoke over him, insulted him, and basically did everything he could  to get Ventura to take a swing at him.  That is such bullshit.  I can't even tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what happened.  Such fucking bullshit.  To think that I wanted him to take a swing at me, it's like, you dummy.  Crazy.  Stop it.  I really didn't.  I was being sarcastic, and I was addressing the posturing he was doing. 
[01:51:00]  What an asshole this guy is.  I fucking...  Do your homework, dude.  And by the way...  Fucking baby.  The walkout didn't happen because of the 9-11 discussion.  No.  You idiot.  No.  The walkout came about when they were discussing immigration.  And putting words in whose mouth.  Right.  Had nothing to do with 9-11 at that point.  Like, didn't that guy...  And even the clip, if you just pay attention to the dumb five-minute clip, it says 20 minutes  later.  And right after that graphic appears, 20 minutes later, that's when all hell breaks loose. 
[01:51:30]  So you don't even know what was being discussed when Jesse walked out.  So you can't say it was about 9-11, you idiot.  And the thing that's funny is, in that little clip, you see me saying to Jesse, look, you  put words in my mouth, I put words...  I think you put words in your...  Whatever.  Like, I think you put words in my mouth, you think I put words in your mouth.  You said I didn't respect the Constitution.  It's something I've watched...  It was something I said about the Constitution.  Yeah.  It's like, can't you tell that there has been a heated discussion between two people? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Most of the hate mail I've gotten, which again, I love it, I really do, is a bunch of you  fucking 9-11 truth or jizz bags.  That's what they are.  And don't be wrestling fans.  And I don't care if you don't like me.  Well, when he finally does that show on his show...  You disrespected a veteran!  Shut up.  When he finally does his 9-11 rant on that stupid show of his, it's really going to just  show him for the phony that he is, especially as far as that conspiracy goes, look, film 
[01:52:30]  through this window, I want them to see.  And all you see is like a light.  Oh, really?  What the fuck he's even talking about?  Lunatic.  Take a swing.  Okay, so you wanted Ventura to take a swing at you.  That's so ridiculous.  This is just an asshole blogger misinterpreting what he saw, which is, by the way, this is  saying, Kevin, that's why you're a blogger.  Yeah.  That's why you do a wrestling blog.  Well, dude. 
[01:53:00]  In the old days, it would be in a newsletter.  Hold on, guys.  You can listen to Kevin.  He does radio, too.  At 3 p.m. on WNST, 1570 AM.  Oh, does he?  No way the numbers go up to 1570.  I defy you to tune a radio into 1570.  Holy shit.  That's short waiting.  Kevin, your career is just taking off.  Yeah, he's obviously a powerhouse blogger radio star.  You have a couple hundred people that read your blog, and you're on an AM fucking radio 
[01:53:30]  station.  My microwave oven throws off 1570.  That's the frequency.  Jesus.  The fuck?  Well, you were trying to get just, okay, to swing at you, Jimmy.  I thought Ventura showed remarkable restraint by not doing so.  I honestly can't say that I could have done the same thing under those circumstances.  Of course not.  You're probably a fighter.  Can't help yourself.  By the way, how good of a radio guy could he be if he couldn't restrain himself from  punching somebody in an argument?  Right.  How awful a radio show must he do if he can't handle a heated disagreement with somebody 
[01:54:00]  without restraining himself?  He's just jealous.  He knows exactly who we are.  He knows who you are.  He wanted to talk about this.  Of course.  It's all right here for you to see for yourself.  I suppose Ventura should have known what he was getting into by appearing on the show.  Now, personally, I can't stand these shock radio Howard Stern wannabe shows.  How did he know?  Why would he say that?  Why would he say it's a shock radio show if he had no idea what it was? 
[01:54:30]  How would he know?  He's just hearing an argument between two people.  How do you know what it is?  You know exactly who we are, douchebag.  They're too mean-spirited for my taste.  And when discussing serious subjects, they only lower the discourse.  That's such bullshit.  We have very intelligent conversations in this show, Kevin.  Let's have a debate with him.  Love to have Kevin on.  I would love to see who lowers the discourse.  It probably would be us.  Someone get a hold of this dumb Kevin.  What's his fucking name?  Ick.  Oh, it should be Ick. 
[01:55:00]  I read this, and it only annoyed me because the guy obviously didn't do his homework.  But there was one comment below that kind of annoyed me.  Some guy was going, I saw this comedian.  And then some guy was walking out.  Did they say so-called?  I love when they go, so-called comedian.  No, they put quotes.  That's a sign of great writing.  And the guy goes, I saw this comedian perform, and some guy had to leave because he said his  father was in the hospital, and the comedian said he hopes the father dies.  It's like, dude.  Oh, I got it.  Let me read it for you.  That's just a lie.  I was actually at a show where the comedian in question went on a tirade against the guy 
[01:55:30]  that walked out.  He starts spewing profanities and names, and the guy explained his dad was in the hospital  and he needed to go call and check in on him.  And the comedian said something about hoping his dad died and called him a pussy or a prick.  It's pee, something.  He's a piece of garbage.  I didn't even see the argument, but Ventura's immediately right in my book.  Now, that's healthy.  I don't care about that, but I'm just saying that right there.  That's the only thing that really annoyed me, because it's a lie.  That's all I got to say. 
[01:56:00]  Howard Stern is way more talented than these goons.  His interview with Jesse was much better.  Really?  Oh, yeah?  Anyone talking about the Howard Stern-Jesse Ventura interview, you dope?  Read all about it.  You know how jealous Howard was that we got all that ink?  I love when people think that, hey, he's trying to get his face out there.  I honestly mean this.  Viral video's fine.  I don't care about it.  It's like, look, I'm doing Leno this week on Wednesday and Friday. 
[01:56:30]  Two days this week.  Yes, so you figure, what do you want to say, six million a night?  That's 12 million people.  I'm not being arrogant, but I'm really not trying to get my name mentioned by this dickhead  or Rick Sanchez on fucking...  I've never heard of either one of these guys.  So I'm really not...  You know, come on, be realistic.  The bloggers have gotten this fucking credibility.  What a sense of self-importance for people who aren't good enough to make it in the mainstream media,  which you can be shitty and make it in.  They got credibility because the mainstream media is very lazy. 
[01:57:00]  That's extremely lazy.  This is the New Millennium...  They would rather copy and paste instead of do their own fucking research.  New Millennium's way of putting out a newsletter.  Yep.  That's what this is.  Of course.  You used to have to sit in your fucking house and print something out from your word processor.  But when we were growing up, your newsletter didn't have a chance of appearing on CNN.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Like now, they have all this power because of that, but it's the equivalent of what that used to be.  It's no more or less credible or gives them any more or less intelligence on a subject. 
[01:57:30]  But they think, for some reason, because they're on a blog, they're on the internet, look, it's a web page.  It looks just like CNN's.  Yeah.  Well, before we start, why don't we try to do this?  I would love to see if Rick Sanchez...  Is that his name?  Yeah.  ...will come on this show.  Because he obviously, again, he's another guy who just didn't do what he was supposed to do.  Yeah, basically.  So I would love to not even yell at the guy, just ask him, why would you spin it a certain way when you're obviously... 
[01:58:00]  He won't come on the show.  I guarantee...  Once you hear the audio.  No way.  None of these guys come on the show.  It wasn't that bad.  It was just irritating because he obviously didn't do his homework.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, though.  The blogger not doing his homework, whatever, but a guy on CNN not doing his homework, that's embarrassing.  Although I'm not surprised.  I'm not stupid when it comes to that shit.  All right.  Like, I went on Joy Behar and I explained, I think pretty well, what happened.  And I didn't use it as a chance to shit on Ventura. 
[01:58:30]  I just said, hey, you know, it's two guys.  He's argumentative.  I'm argumentative.  It was a pretty basic thing.  And this guy's like, and the shock jock.  It's like, oh my, you fucking terrible journalist.  Horrible.  You terrible hack journalist.  How was Joy?  Good?  She was great.  Yeah.  She's very nice.  And again, she's a comic.  So I'm always biased towards comics.  But I love the bias of people.  I'm reading the comments.  It was really funny.  He's a Jew.  Some people are calling me a Jew because I'm a Joy.  It's just silly.  You're a Jew? 
[01:59:00]  Some of these white supremacists really are just dumb cunts.  We're trying to get Kevin on the phone.  So we'll see if he's brave enough to back up his words.  Yeah, I don't even want to attack the guy.  I really don't.  I'm not angry.  I just want to know why would you do that without researching it first, bro.  Also, that play in last night's game of what's-his-name, Henderson, I believe, breaking his femur bone.  It's on YouTube.  If you've got a strong stomach, check it out.  We checked it out.  Wow.  Yeah, you kind of see his femur busts right above the knee, it looks like. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, so it looks like he's got two knees, basically.  His leg, like the lower part of his right leg, he's running after someone, and someone goes to tackle,  and their helmet drills his femur, and as he flips over, his right leg kind of does like a 360.  It's a ragdoll.  Like below the knee.  Yeah, a ragdoll leg.  It's ragdolling.  Wow.  Ragdolling.  Jimmy pointed out, I mean, he was in such pain, he's holding two guys' hands.  They're holding his hands.  Probably as tight as he could hold.  Hold my hand. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, Bobby Kelly had to.  I mean, that's a kind of a pain where any bullshit masculine image.  I was saying while we were looking at the clip, why don't you just give the guy propofol immediately?  Why go through that fucking pain?  Knock him out for the 15 minutes.  Why don't you get him off the field?  Yeah, when a huge man wants another man holding his hand.  Can't be good.  It's just fucking, like, that's pain.  Can't be good.  Here's the play again.  Here he goes.  One of the chronos is running, and his own man hit him.  His own man went for the cardinal tackle, and they just missed. 
[02:00:30]  Just a complete accident, obviously.  Why did I say that?  Who didn't know that?  That's got to be a career ender.  I don't know if he'd come back.  I don't know about that.  I don't know if he'd come back from a femur fucking break, man.  I don't know.  Someone else would know better than I, but.  That's the biggest bone in your body?  I don't know how you'd come back from that.  That's terrible.  Ed Henderson.  I love this YouTube guy.  Best wishes to EJ Henderson, really?  Yeah, best wishes, but I'm just going to show it.  You're just hoping they don't fucking yank your video.  I wonder if that's a two-year rehab or a one-year. 
[02:01:00]  Oh.  That could be career ending.  It could be, but I mean, you can come back from a lot of breaks.  Derek, Louisiana has a problem with us.  Derek.  Oh, no.  Hello, guys.  Hi, Derek.  Why?  Yeah, you especially.  Why do y'all have to attack everybody?  What do y'all stand against anybody?  Derek, we're only attacking people that have kind of attacked first.  Like, this Kevin Eck kind of attacked first, and Rick Sanchez did a bad job. 
[02:01:30]  To explain further, because Derek sounds a little dumb, he's mad that we're criticizing everybody that's attacking us.  No, we're criticizing the people that didn't do their basic fucking homework about what happened between Jimmy and Jesse Ventura.  People are allowed to have their opinions.  We're all, we're fine with that, but when they misrepresent because they're lazy fucks, yeah, we have a problem with it.  Yeah, Derek, honestly, like, if somebody was talking about you and saying something that you felt they were misrepresenting you,  wouldn't you kind of just, you know, shit talk back? 
[02:02:00]  Well, but see, like, y'all say that there's nobodies, that they don't have anybody listening to them.  Why would you even credit that?  Because I don't, because I don't look at, I'm not so arrogant, honestly, I'm not so arrogant where I think,  well, I'm a, I'm, I'm this big important thing, and he's a nobody.  He's a guy online who got, I didn't mind that his opinion disagreed,  but he was coming off as a guy who kind of knew what he was talking about.  It was obvious he didn't, and that was irritating.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  And he hangs up.  Wow.  We did not hang up on that guy.  No, no, we didn't hang up.  We waited for an answer.  Derek, where'd you go?  You called up.  Because you killed him with intelligence.  But I mean, where'd, why'd you hang up?  That's what we're getting at.  It's like, you were allowed to talk, no one was going to yell at you?  No, he didn't have a comeback for that.  That went way above his fucking brain capacity.  I don't get, I don't get this now.  He's like, oh, fuck, I'm drowning.  He's just, oh, wait, this guy's friends with, all right, Brian in Baltimore. 
[02:03:00]  What's up, Brian?  Hey, I went, we grew up together, Kevin and I.  We graduated from Dundalk High School.  And when we were kids, we were all into the wrestling thing, like all of us probably were.  Right.  But then the rest, most of us outbrew it.  You know, Kevin's still into the wrestling.  That's what he writes about in the Baltimore Sun.  His blog is called Ring Post.  It's all about professional wrestling.  Right.  I think it's funny he rips on you guys, because, you know, the lowest common denominator, yet  he loves professional wrestling.  That is hilarious.  Is he right for the paper, or does he write for their online site? 
[02:03:30]  The online site is where he has his blog.  I mean, he does occasional features, like if they come to town, the wrestling show comes  to Baltimore, they'll do a bit about it.  That's funny.  He writes about wrestling, and he's worried about lowering the bar of intelligence in a discussion.  Jesus Christ.  As another wrestler dies, by the way, of a heart attack, was it, at 36 years old?  Who?  And look, that radio station he's on at the 1570, it's owned by his best friend. 
[02:04:00]  It's a guy who goes by the name Nasty Nestor, who worships at the feet of Howard Stern.  Wait, you never want to work for a radio station that is owned by Nasty Nestor.  Nasty Nestor.  What the fuck?  Does Nasty Nestor write a wrestling column?  What's that?  Does he write a wrestling column, too?  Dude, Nestor?  No, no, he's above that.  He's got his own website.  He's got all sorts of Baltimore sports on and such.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Can we hear any clips of this guy's radio show?  I'm embarrassed.  Kevin Eck.  There has to be clips of his radio show. 
[02:04:30]  I'm fucking embarrassed.  This guy did a Q&A with Jesse Nestor on his Twitter.  Because he writes about wrestling, so he gets the wrestling guys.  Oh, okay.  Now you can see the agenda here.  Just shut up.  Exactly.  Just shut your fucking mouth with your agenda.  You think he's biased?  Oh, just a tad.  Guys, breaking news on Billy Joel's daughter.  We are your one for whatever.  Breaking news about Billy Joel's daughter. 
[02:05:00]  Yes, Dan.  Yeah, I found out why Billy Joel's daughter attempted suicide.  Yes.  Oh.  She found out she has a dad's looks and a mother's talent.  Oh.  How old a gal is she?  23.  28, yeah.  23?  Yeah.  All right.  And Sanchez.  She's impressed over a guy.  That's all it.  Is that what that was?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Mike.  Mike, you got something on this?  Rick Sanchez.  Mike!  From CNN.  Hey, how you guys doing, boys?  All right.  We got the audio, too.  Good.  What do you got?  Hey, listen.  Hey, Rick Sanchez used to be a head anchor here in Miami for Fox. 
[02:05:30]  And one day he was at one of the Dolphin games.  And I guess he had a little too much of a drink.  And he ran over a couple people.  So they shipped his ass out of Miami.  Come on.  Please tell me that's true.  Come on.  Hey, look at me.  Look it up.  I'm not kidding you, man.  Come on.  Oh, please.  Why am I happy?  I'm telling you the truth.  Come on.  He was a head anchor on Channel 7 in Miami.  And he was at a Dolphins game. 
[02:06:00]  And he had a little too much beer to drink.  And he ran over a couple people when he was leaving the stadium.  And they just swept it under the rug and shipped his ass out of here.  Oh, fuck.  Danny's looking it up right now.  Well, if he was with Fox, they probably fired him because he's with CNN now, no?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  That's what happened.  Well, he works with actor Fox.  I guess he went to MSNBC for a while.  And then after that, he went to CNN.  Here's the thing that bothered me.  Because somebody said it might be his immigration stance.  But it was obviously such a biased thing. 
[02:06:30]  And then even after the explanation on Joy Behar's show, which wasn't some radical, crazy explanation.  It's like, why would you take the same stance when you heard the person in question explaining it?  Well, we got it.  We're going to play it.  Hey, thanks for that news.  We got it right here.  Oh, 1990.  Mike's right.  1990, December 10th.  So the anniversary's coming up.  Oh, no.  He died, this guy.  Jesus.  We should probably send an anniversary card to Rick Sanchez.  On December 10th, 1990, Sanchez struck a pedestrian.  Oh, he did a little Tom Brokaw, did he?  You hear about Brokaw?  Yeah.  Oh, well. 
[02:07:00]  Brokaw wasn't involved, really, in it.  We'll look into the Brokaw thing later.  Jeffrey Smudzenich.  Yeah, with the car.  Read it from there, Jimmy.  It's hard to read.  On December 10th.  Where is this from, Danny?  The Wikipedia entry.  All right.  Well, this is Wikipedia.  So whether it's true or not, who knows?  I mean, on December 10th, 1990, Sanchez struck a pedestrian, Jeff something, with his car  on a residential street near Dolphin Stadium, after the guy darted into the road.  The guy was paralyzed and eventually died in an assisted living facility in 95. 
[02:07:30]  Sanchez, who had just left, I guess, an NFL football game with his father, and then in  parentheses, and left the scene of the accident, was not charged with causing the accident,  but was charged with and pleaded no contest to DUI.  What's below that?  Anything or no?  Now, try to find that from a legitimate news source.  Wait.  That's not a fucking Wikipedia.  How are you not charged with causing the accident?  Because the guy darted out in the front.  Oh, darted.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  But, you know, again, that's not from a legitimate news source.  It's Wikipedia.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, so it's not like he completely... 
[02:08:00]  Anyone can change that.  Yeah, exactly.  Could have been that guy who just called up and wants to get me sued.  That was Rick Sanchez.  Well, this is how Rick Sanchez handled the Ventura thing on Friday.  This might not be true, by the way.  Because, again, he's Googling the guy's name and it's not coming up.  Well, Google News only...  They don't give you results from 1990.  I don't think we have to scream at each other, Dan.  Screaming.  More news coming in.  Chris M. from Boston.  Nasty Nester is best known for choking Gordon Keith. 
[02:08:30]  Whatever that's supposed to mean.  What's that?  I don't know.  Do we have Sanchez's name come up in that?  Lawyer, Richard Essin.  Well...  We're just doing research right now.  Researching...  Indeed, when former anchor Rick Sanchez, now a CNN host, decided to plead no contest in 91 to driving under the influence and seriously injuring a pedestrian,  and infuriated Essin withdrew his counsel. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, okay.  That's a pretty serious injury.  Death.  Yep.  Well, he died...  According to the story, the guy died like five years later.  So he was paralyzed in the accident and then died later on.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, five years.  Oh, that's right.  In assisted living.  Okay.  In hell for five years.  Sleep with himself now.  And God did the right thing and took him.  Why don't we play the Sanchez shit from Friday?  Here we go.  The former Minnesota governor, obviously a one-time pro wrestler.  He's making the rounds.  He's plugging his intro conspiracy. 
[02:09:30]  Oops.  I can tell this clip is going to take a few minutes to get paid.  The former Minnesota governor, obviously a one-time pro wrestler.  He's making the rounds.  He's plugging his new show, Conspiracy Theory, on True TV,  which, like CNN, full disclosure here, is owned by Tom Warner.  The former governor goes on a radio show earlier this week,  and he spars with one of the shock jocks there. 
[02:10:00]  First of all, shock jock is a great term in 1990,  when you were fucking plowing into people.  Nobody says that anymore, you fucking cornball.  And I'm a comedian.  And at this point, is what we do shocking or what he does?  It's not shocking.  I think it's more shocking that you're running over people  leading a fucking football game than what we say on the radio.  I wouldn't be shocking ever if I was Rick Sanchez with the history he has.  Shock jocks there, which is, in and of itself, 
[02:10:30]  probably not a smart move on his part, but I digress.  I want you to watch.  I want you to watch.  Why do you digress?  Yeah, this is going to take some time.  Why wouldn't it be a smart move?  Why?  We've had great interviews with a lot of great guests,  and we've helped them out, and they've helped our show out.  He's a man who said thermite paint was partially responsible  for bringing down 110-story buildings,  but yet it's crazy to go on this show, 
[02:11:00]  which he'd go on legitimate news sources.  Why wouldn't it be a good idea, Rick?  Do you know?  Yeah, exactly.  Get him on the fucking phone.  Yeah, exactly.  Could he at least talk while he's driving or drinking  or whatever it is he's doing?  Why wouldn't it be a good idea?  Uh-huh.  A list of people that have been on our show  where we've had great, you know, discussions.  Exactly.  It's not a long one, but...  But, I digress.  I want you to watch now what happens  as Ventura is all but assailed on the radio.  But it just so happens to also be captured. 
[02:11:30]  On video.  On video.  Yes.  It was captured on video.  Exactly.  What's happened?  That was a combo platter.  Do the bit.  All right, we will.  Oh, my God.  How's the search for a job going, dummy?  How'd your parents die?  What's happened?  Oh, ah. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, shit.  That's terrible.  Jesse Ventura was invited to that show.  It's like a pit bull.  Oh, okay.  So, I guess he plays the clip?  Yeah.  All right.  So, he sets up the clip.  He plays the...  I bet you didn't play the whole clip, by the way,  which is important, too, but whatever.  No, of course.  He might have, but he didn't play the whole interview.  I didn't see it myself.  And he watched the whole interview, obviously.  So, then he comes out of the clip, and that's what we're about to hear here.  Okay. 
[02:12:30]  Jesse Ventura was invited to that show.  It's like a pit bull being poked with a stick.  Well, he was supposed to be invited to a game,  but he was afraid there'd be too much drinking in the parking lot after all.  So, he didn't want to go to the ball game,  because he was afraid somebody might drink and then plow into a pedestrian.  Yeah, Rick, I think he's safer here than near you while you're on the fucking road. 
[02:13:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Just go back inside.  Your son's banging everything in sight.  That's what happened.  Make the men some coffee.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, we're going to be you all night.  We're going to get some fucking food cooked for us.  Tigers in the knoll of the street.  Yeah, we got some reporter ran by and hit him.  This is fucking Rick Sanchez. 
[02:13:30]  Come on our show.  We'll explain everything to you, you dummy.  Honestly, what he said wasn't so terrible.  No, I know, but do you understand that he hadn't listened to the whole thing?  Do you understand Jesse didn't come in here,  and it wasn't our intention to try to get him to swing at anybody at all.  But we're not pussies either.  It got intense, and we go with it.  It's been on the show before, first of all, a couple of times.  And we always get into a heated dispute with him because we definitely don't share the same ideology.  And if you listen to the clip, you'll see that it's really him that babied out on Jimmy having basic conversations like we had in the past with the guy. 
[02:14:00]  Because he keeps threatening to leave.  I'm going to leave.  All right, well, I'll take it either.  And then we had a nice chat with him.  Well, he gets mad if people don't agree with him.  Yeah, and I bet you did a lot of fucking interviews where people just sat back and let him, you know, spew his horse shit.  I don't get intimidated.  I get angry.  That's what he said on the show last night when I was watching. 
[02:14:30]  When they wouldn't let him through the gate, I don't get intimidated.  John in Houston, with the instant feedback of the day, he writes,  At least Jesse got up and walked away.  That's a good point.  Oh, shit.  Wow, that is good.  Oh, wow.  You're a shock driver.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the shock jock.  You boo.  Like a pit bull being poked by a stick or a human poked by a bumper. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, shock jock.  We hurt people with words.  He hurts people with his car.  There's a difference, you dope.  His name is the bumper kid.  Shit, man.  It's like a pit bull being poked with a stick.  Isn't it?  And it continues.  Last night, that shock jock visited with Joy Behar on HLN to explain his version of how things got so out of control.  Now, do they play what he played on there?  I believe so, yeah.  I'm just pausing because the word shock jock, it's like, dude, it's enough already with that. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, people aren't shocked anymore in this society of ours.  Another hacky reporter.  Shock jock.  It was relevant maybe 10 years ago, I would say.  Maybe.  Jesus.  Come up with a new word.  Yep.  The reason I insulted him like that was because, you know, he had cursed at me, I had cursed at him, and then he patted me.  He goes, all right, well, thank you for your patriotism, and he patted me.  And when he touched me, it's like that raises it because I'm not going to give up and touch him back. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not stupid.  I mean, I have a big mouth on a microphone, but I'm not going to challenge an ex-wrestler.  He would have punted me through the wall.  Exactly.  Well, he's a lot older than you, though.  You might have been able to take him.  He's an older gentleman.  Hopefully, he'd have a Viagra heart attack, but there's nothing else I could do to combat Jesse Ventura.  Yeah.  So I just insulted him, but people made more out of it.  It was like, look, we're both guys.  We had a fight.  He's a combative guy.  I'm a combative guy.  I'm glad he didn't punch me in the face.  Because we know this has gone viral, and we knew many of you would be talking about it. 
[02:16:30]  We reached out and put the folks from Opie on our list.  From Opie.  Rick's list, that is.  What the fuck does that mean, you idiot?  But can you hear it?  Like, he obviously heard that explanation, which was not...  What was shocking about that explanation?  No.  Were both guys...  Because I am argumentative.  I know that.  He is two guys.  He had an argument.  So what?  That's all it was.  You explained it perfectly.  Perfectly.  And to hear that and then still have the same douchebag, smarmy reporter thing, it doesn't  make sense to me.  What's the list? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know.  Maybe people he owes apologies to in Florida?  No, I think...  I think what he meant was he just added my Twitter to his dumb Twitter.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, that's good.  I think.  And now he reads comments.  And a lot of you are responding.  Let's go right to that if we possibly can.  These are folks just watching our newscast right now.  We're interested in your take.  He says, he's lucky Jesse Ventura didn't slam that microphone into his head.  Yeah.  There's another one, I think, just like this one. 
[02:17:30]  It says, what?  Let's check that out and see if we can get it.  Back to...  Is that...  No, the one right under that.  There you go.  Cameron Frye is saying, with Jesse Ventura on CNN, Jesse Ventura, all I see is a shock  jock being a jerk.  It's the third one right there, Robert.  All I see is a jock shock being a jerk and Ventura calmly listening while being insulted.  So there you go.  We've got different perspectives from different people.  We invite you if you want.  No, you don't.  We're going to try to put it up and you can see it yourself or you can see it, of course, 
[02:18:00]  on the Internet.  You had your perspective, one asshole, and then two assholes who agreed with you that  you selectively read.  Where's all the different perspectives?  We've read plenty in support of Jim.  But he didn't ask him for mine.  No.  He did a horrible job with that segment.  Of course he did.  Oh, God.  Did a worse job driving out of that parking lot.  He sure did.  Vroom, vroom.  All right.  Vroom, vroom.  I love the sound clips.  He has to blow into a breathalyzer before the teleprompter starts moving. 
[02:18:30]  No, down the next one.  Okay, walk a straight line.  What?  You guys want more Jersey Shore clips or what?  Oh, fuck.  I want more Sanchez fucking drunk stories.  I could listen to them all day.  Ouch.  I got to find a full story on that.  I really want to know the details.  I would love to. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Fuck.  I'll just slam that guy.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, he's a dope.  Just another dope.  That's where we got more little guineas walking around Jersey.  Yeah, more from the Jersey Shore.  Great.  TV show.  We have more situation clips.  The situation.  The situation of the character.  Yeah.  Name's The Situation.  How cool is that?  If you're just tuning in, listen to the replay.  We did, I don't know, a half hour, 40 minutes on this just brilliant show called The Jersey Shore that MTV's got going on. 
[02:19:30]  First MTV show I've paid attention to in many years.  It's about guidos and guidettes hanging out on the Jersey Shore for the summer, living in a house.  This is kind of a real world thing with Italians.  Are they going to track down Rick?  Yeah.  We'll get Rick on the fucking show?  I just spoke to the CNN publicist.  They are trying to track him down right now.  Okay, good.  We're going to set him straight.  I just want to ask, I don't even want to yell at the guy.  I honestly just want to ask, why wouldn't you listen to the whole interview as a journalist? 
[02:20:00]  How about we ask him, what do you know about this?  Yes.  And then we'll go from there and go, really?  Well, we'll point out about a million things that are wrong.  So Sam came in with more clips from The Jersey Shore, more clips of the situation.  Oh, mostly the situation, good.  Yeah, I wanted to go over some of what he did.  During the first two-hour episode.  Yeah, I mean, the first clip is what we were talking about earlier when he gave some of the rules of going out and clubbing. 
[02:20:30]  Rules?  Fuck your shirt.  That's why I didn't put anything on you.  I do not want to put anything on you.  I wait until the last minute to put a shave and wait until the last minute to put your shirt on because you feel fresh.  These are rules to live by.  Shave last minute, haircut the day of, maybe some tanning in the gym.  You got to do the Guido handbook.  Get the haircut.  We should write that book.  I bet you the situation writes a Guido handbook.  He should.  I'd buy it.  You would, right?  And adopt some of his lifestyle traits.  Do you get a haircut the night before you go, the day of the night? 
[02:21:00]  The day of.  The day of?  Yeah, if you're going out the night.  Wouldn't that be a lot of haircuts?  Yeah, because you got to keep your look fresh, keep the line up straight, everything.  I get ten haircuts a year.  I guess I can only go out ten nights a year now.  That's it?  Yeah, that's right.  I want to follow the situation's rules.  And who doesn't?  Yeah, if you want to get girls.  Yeah.  Holla.  Exactly.  He gets the chicks.  Like Rambo.  The situation and Ronnie, talk about girls in the car.  Ronnie says he likes Sammy.  Well, yeah.  And so does the situation. 
[02:21:30]  Sammy Sweetheart is the girl that's rooming with Pauly D in the situation.  That's right.  Thank you for reminding us.  And the situation.  She's a guidette.  She's a guidette.  But the situation and Sammy Sweetheart are sort of, you know, starting to head it off.  And she's the girl that the situation is looking at.  He starts to get alarmed when he's talking to Ronnie, the big muscular guy in the car.  And now Ronnie is talking about maybe he likes Sammy.  Sammy Sweetheart.  Sammy Sweetheart.  Yeah, so there could be a problem here.  I kind of can't wait to go out, dude. 
[02:22:00]  There's so much.  You had a chance last night.  I'm probably just going to get sloppy.  I should have just pounded out what's your name on Friday.  Which one?  I mean, on the first night.  Snickers.  These guys think you like Sammy.  Not necessarily like him.  Maybe you want to hook up with him.  I'm not saying.  Exactly.  At least somebody says she's cute.  Yeah, Sammy's cute.  There's something about him.  It's like, you know what I'm saying?  She tires herself very well.  I was like, do I have a little competition?  I was thinking with Ronnie.  But then I was like, nah, I don't.  That's why you got to like this situation because of his natural confidence. 
[02:22:30]  He's being honest.  You can tell.  Yeah.  And he's just naturally confident.  He knows what his strengths and weaknesses are.  I got to tell you, I think MTV just set up a situation right there that is about to go down.  The situation is part of the situation.  Yes.  There's now a situation with the situation.  Hopefully one woman with a whip making two guys practice forced by.  Sammy talks to the situation.  What the hell is forced by?  Timmy, you just don't make that up. 
[02:23:00]  What is that?  Forced by.  What is forced by?  That's when you're forced into bisexual sex.  It's a very common term with doms.  I'm surprised you don't know that.  It's a very...  Yeah.  Oh, doms.  Yeah.  Forced by.  Yeah.  It's like you learn all the terms when you're looking through all their ads.  There's a...  Like this...  Of course.  Sam, please.  You're trying to embarrass me?  What's wrong, Sam?  Hell no.  It smells bad in this area.  I wonder why.  Oh, it's awful.  Then he kept talking like this.  Then remove yourself from the studio then. 
[02:23:30]  I didn't mean to do that.  Huh?  Turned that around on you there, Sam.  Smells bad and it's talking like this.  Oh.  That's bad.  Yeah.  All right.  Sammy talks to the situation.  Situation cock blocks Ronnie.  Any guys like me in the house?  I'm like, what?  Are you serious right now?  I know guys talk.  Let's go.  Definitely not Ronnie.  I don't know about Mike.  Like if he is just like a schmoozer or if he's really intimate.  So I'm holding back.  I'm holding back a little bit. 
[02:24:00]  What do you think about Ronnie?  He's like raw.  He thinks he's raw.  He says some like...  Yeah.  Some like crazy...  He's badass a little bit.  He doesn't care what he's going to say.  He just says like some like...  I want to pound on every girl in Seaside type stuff.  You know, that's how he is.  I'm trying to pretty much block Ronnie with Sam.  Um...  I don't necessarily feel bad.  I didn't even think twice about it.  If you notice his tact at the beginning of that clip, he thought he was going to really  trick her because she goes, do any of the guys in the house like me? 
[02:24:30]  And before she could even finish, she goes, well, definitely not Ronnie.  Definitely not him.  He sounds like this tough guy or whatever, but he falls for this Sammy Sweetheart.  Big talk.  He's definitely in love with Sammy Sweetheart.  Then gets his heart broken by the end of the two hour fucking season premiere.  Yeah, you saw her.  I mean, she's not bad looking.  As far as the Gweedettes go, yeah, she's probably the best looking out of the bunch.  She's no Snooki.  Well, I mean, JWoww has the fucking boobs, but...  Yeah, but JWoww's not the one you bring home to mom, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:25:00]  Snooki has a punchable face, as we learn.  As we learn later on in the season, that goes down.  Wow.  A very punchable face.  What happened?  What happened?  I went wow, actually, that they showed that.  Oh, the punching?  Yeah.  The punch or whatever?  Yeah.  It is a tough punch she takes, man.  That's a right hook.  Wow.  Right cross.  I can't wait for that episode.  Situation says he and Sammy will hook up.  Ronnie lets his intentions be known.  Yeah, this is where they're coming.  Me and Sam, we're vibing. 
[02:25:30]  It's not a matter of if she wants to hook up with me.  It's a matter of just when I decide.  I'm going to hand my hands on the Kool-Aid tonight, brother.  She has the nicest legs I've ever seen on a woman, bro.  Seriously.  Ronnie, he's not an ugly dude by any means.  I'm not a hater at all.  It's just sometimes you've got it.  You've got the lingo.  You can talk to girls.  And sometimes you ain't got it.  You look very pretty tonight, Sam.  It should be definitely interesting tonight, considering Sam is in love with me and Ronnie  is also in love with me, probably, too, because, you know, he wishes he had what I have. 
[02:26:00]  Wait, so now Ronnie's in love with the situation?  The situation believes that both Ronnie and Sammy are in love with each other.  With him.  All these guys, I swear to you, are a few shots away from just sucking each other's dick one night.  They are so close to just, you know, a few shots.  And if there's not a girl around, they'll just be like, yeah, we'll just suck each other's dicks.  No, no, no.  That's not part of the Guido lifestyle. 
[02:26:30]  Go back to the punch again.  The Snooki getting punched is just...  Wonderful.  It's unbelievable.  That should be the whole show.  It's un-fucking-believable.  Boom!  Boom!  Boom, popped right to the jaw.  That is a fucking...  You punch a man like that.  That was a bad punch.  Boom!  For a guy, that would be a devastating blow.  It hurt me so bad.  You would fall right on the fucking...  Did she get knocked the fuck out, or is that what it is?  There it is right there.  They're tending to her right after the club.  And then they have a shot of the guy being arrested.  And she's got like a thing on her nose saying, who punches a girl? 
[02:27:00]  A bunch of dumb fucks that hang out at the same clubs you do, dummy.  The situation all...  Well, this is the after effect, because then they go out.  Right.  And the situation kind of awkwardly decides to make his move, which is just standing in  front of her and starting to dance, and then forcing a kiss.  Right.  And then like a half hour later into the night, she just randomly goes up to Ronnie and starts  making out with him on the dance floor.  Yeah, so she blows up the situation, starts making out with Ronnie, so now fucking... 
[02:27:30]  the situation's like, what the fuck?  The situation is heated at this point, because he didn't expect that.  So, I'm going downstairs, and get some drinks, and sure enough, Sam was there, Ronnie was  there, and then I just flipped, I snapped.  Did you have a good time, son?  Yeah.  I'd be dead.  No, you did.  Because you f***ed things up.  Mike right now is jealous about me and Sam being together or whatever, talking.  He needs to get over it at this point.  I don't be happy with your choice. 
[02:28:00]  I know you're happy.  Yeah, I'm happy.  Deep down, I'm a sweetheart.  I don't know if everybody sees the exterior, that I'm a little player.  But in reality, I was very pissed, and I was about to Jerry spring her ass.  He must think that he can just get any single girl he wants, that every girl likes him.  I don't know why he thinks I like him like that.  Like, I want nothing to do with you, Mike, honestly.  Um, yeah, I hooked up with you, but I went to Ronnie.  I liked Ronnie.  I do like Ronnie.  Yo, you was feeling me?  You was holding my hand the whole time at the ball walk?  What was that?  All right, whatever.  I actually liked you, too. 
[02:28:30]  Why is it hot?  I'm jacked.  Do your thing.  Do your thing.  Do your thing.  Have fun.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He's talking to her like she really blew it.  Well.  Yeah.  She did.  Come on.  I know.  I mean, that's what I'm saying.  She could have been with.  She had the chance to be with the situation.  She did blow it, Sam.  Who can beat up who?  Ronnie or the situation?  Ronnie is a bit tougher.  Ronnie looks like a kick in the ass of the situation.  He's a little bit bulkier.  I mean, the situation is cut, but Ronnie. 
[02:29:00]  See, the situation only lifts up his shirt every once in a while.  Ronnie is fucking rocking without the shirt the entire two-hour episode.  Yeah.  Ah, well, see.  Ronnie is a giant.  And is Ronnie the one with the big Cadillac tattoo?  No, that's Pauly D.  Oh, Pauly D.  They all looked alike.  No, Ronnie is the big, giant, like, muscular.  They all do look alike, these guidos.  Whereas, you know, the situation is a little slimmer.  Mm-hmm.  You know, he's not in fighting form.  He's more just some eye candy for the ladies.  Oh, we got breaking news from Andy in Cleveland. 
[02:29:30]  I did not know this.  Yes, Andy?  Oh, yeah.  I just can't wait for the next episode when the situation has a three-way with the event and the circumstance.  Okay.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Right on.  Those aren't names of real characters.  Are you sure?  Yes, I'm sure.  Sounds like they would be.  Which wrestler died, Sam?  Because people are asking, and I know he was one of your favorites.  Umaga.  Umaga died.  Which one is that?  How old was he?  36.  And he was still actively wrestling? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, he was just on the Hulk Hogan tour that Hogan and Ric Flair did in Australia like a week ago.  Which one is he, though?  I don't...  Have I ever seen him?  He's a big Samoan, right?  He's a Samoan bulldozer.  And who did he used to, like, wrestle with?  He was in WWE.  He was a big star.  No, he wasn't.  He was dying.  He's former Intercontinental Champion.  He wrestled on Rome.  He wasn't in the WWE anymore?  No, they let him go because he violated the wellness policy.  They call it the wellness policy.  They have a wellness policy, and once you hit three strikes and refuse rehab, that's 
[02:30:30]  the rule.  What did he die of?  Heart attack.  Ah.  Several repeated heart attacks.  That heart attack gets a lot of 36-year-olds, Sam.  They're right.  They're right.  It has nothing to do with the wrestling world.  You never know.  But, I mean, they give these guys the chance to go to rehab even after they fire them.  Like, they're saying, we'll pay for your rehab.  Uh-huh.  You don't even work here, and we'll pay for it.  Well, I don't need it.  You know what?  I don't need it.  Yeah, but Vince had no choice.  This guy's dropping dead all around him.  He finally had to go, all right, we'll pay for your rehab. 
[02:31:00]  But now he's offered rehab.  He doesn't want to pay for their rehab.  But he will, and they won't take it.  There's no choice.  Is it true?  The Rock's cousin?  That was the Rock's cousin.  He's the Rock's cousin.  All the Samoan guys are related.  Wow.  Yeah, he's the Rock's cousin.  Oh, wow.  That sucks.  He had a big tattoo of Samoa written in bamboo across his belly.  Jesus.  It was a real tattoo, too.  That's tragic.  Add him to the list.  I guess.  It is tragic.  Add him to the list of wrestlers.  Where only one died of natural causes.  I only care.  I only care if one is still alive. 
[02:31:30]  If there's only one wrestler I care about, that I hope he's still alive.  I hope he's doing well.  I think he is.  But I think you know who it is.  Let me hear it.  Travis.  I thought I saw Travis actually working.  No, well, you know.  Paul has to distract me.  I actually looked at him for a while and saw him working.  And I was like, oh, he's got it.  We all know who the wrestler is.  Who gives a shit now?  You know the wrestler.  I know the wrestler.  We'll do it again.  It'll be great. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think you know who it is.  Great timing.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  Yes.  Because this is a real wrestler to me.  He talks about asses.  That's right.  And he wrestles in high school in New Jersey.  Yes.  And you've actually called some of his matches, I believe.  Yeah, this.  Wow, how the mighty have fallen right on their ass.  Mr. Ass.  Yes, Mr. Ass.  Steven asks for Bayshore. 
[02:32:30]  Are they sure Rick Sanchez didn't run Umaga over?  You're sure it was a heart attack?  Well.  And that Rick Sanchez was not in the area at the time of his death?  Oh.  If he was in the area, I think that should definitely be looked into.  Because Umaga was still very active.  I think there would be a big dent in the vehicle.  Yeah, he's a Simone Bulldozer.  Somebody that size.  Yes, yes.  I have to tinkle.  Oh, you've got to tinkle.  Make wee-wees.  Badly.  Aw.  Make wee-wees, Jimmy.  Hey, he's doing the I have to wee-wee walk. 
[02:33:00]  Was that a juicy fart that he let loose?  Oh, you couldn't have waited outside.  Holy shit.  We got out.  Took your fucking pants on that one.  Because those are so bad.  He's really got some bad ones today.  The wet ones don't smell usually, believe it or not.  No.  It's those dry dusters.  The dry duster ones.  The wet ones and the hot ones that go.  Yeah, those are the dry dusters.  That smells way worse than a.  Yeah.  We have the 12 Days of Guido.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, no. 
[02:33:30]  There's two versions.  Yeah, you could take your pick.  The long version, the full four-minute version, or the heavily condensed 45-second version.  Let's make these fuckers suffer today.  Yeah.  Let's make them suffer today.  The 12 Days of Guido Christmas or something like that.  We play this going into break.  We got Andy Levy from Red Eye joining the program next.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Joe Bulls.  Merry Christmas.  I'm a nooch.  I heard you saw your nooch.  Yeah, my Paisan.  Let me tell you what he got me this year.  On the first day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me a ride in his Irox Z. 
[02:34:00]  I love that car.  On the second day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  On the third day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me four fresh cannolis. 
[02:34:30]  All tree godfather's old tree godfather's old tree godfather's old tree godfather's two guinea teas.  On the fifth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis.  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's old tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  Let me tell you this more.  On the sixth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings. 
[02:35:00]  Four fresh cannolis.  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  On the seventh day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me seven Piazza jerseys, six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis. 
[02:35:30]  All tree godfather's two Irox Z.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  On the eighth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me eight, how you doing, seven Piazza jerseys, six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z. 
[02:36:00]  On the ninth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me nine balls a-grabbing.  Eight, how you doing, seven Piazza jerseys, six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  On the eleventh day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me ten new hand gestures, nine balls a-grabbing. 
[02:36:30]  Eight, how you doing, seven Piazza jerseys, six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  On the eleventh day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me eleven Sinatra CDs.  A moment of silence for the chairman of the board.  Ten new hand gestures. 
[02:37:00]  Nine balls a-grabbing.  Eight, how you doing, seven Piazza jerseys, six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  On the twelfth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me twelve gobs of hair gel.  Would you watch the hair?  Eleven Sinatra CDs.  Ten new hand gestures. 
[02:37:30]  Nine balls a-grabbing.  Eight, how you doing, seven Piazza jerseys, six Sergio Diquinis, five pinky rings.  How you like me now?  Four fresh cannolis.  All tree godfather's two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Irox Z.  Yeah.  That's for you.  God bless. 
[02:38:00]  Obi and Anthony, we welcome Andy Levy into the studio from Red Eye on Fox News.  Fox News channel, everyone knows.  And tonight, Jimmy, you're going to be on Red Eye?  Yes, I am.  You've got a big TV week ahead of you.  I certainly do.  Red Eye tonight and then Jay Leno?  Wednesday and Friday?  Wednesday and Friday on Leno.  Yeah.  What a coincidence, because I'm doing Red Eye Thursday night.  So Tuesday is the only night this goddamn show will be dark on television.  I don't like it.  We love Jim. 
[02:38:30]  We'd hate him to leave.  Would ya?  And Opie still refuses to come on.  Yes.  Well, are you going to talk politics tonight?  We talk politics every night.  I could have done a little something, something on the Tiger Woods thing, I'm thinking.  But the Obama shit?  Yeah.  I'm out.  I've got to find a show where I can maybe talk more like sports, pop culture shit.  That would be my day.  And if they delve into that whole thing.  A little bit, a little bit.  You should host your own radio show or something.  Ooh.  Yeah, just something like that.  That's a great idea. 
[02:39:00]  A radio show.  Maybe I'll go to the taping with Norton today.  I haven't stopped by and said hi before.  Stop by.  What are you guys going to talk about tonight?  You know yet?  No.  We'll know that until 3 o'clock.  But if it's anything like the past two weeks, it'll be Tiger and Tiger and the golfer guy.  I won't make fun of it, though.  I kid.  Andy, what's your take on the whole Tiger Woods thing?  All I know is, I was just telling you before, I went to sleep last night.  I think it was 6.  Yeah.  And now it's 9.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  At least that was as of a half hour ago.  I don't know what it is now.  I don't think it stops here.  It's like the swine flu.  We need to have a vaccine or something.  Like a girl in every hole.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  And it's very obvious what happened.  I mean, he grew up with his father just telling him he has to hit a million golf balls a day.  He didn't have time to get pussy.  And then it finally all came out.  Like, I fucking need pussy.  Well, I don't know what that word means, but I know certainly he likes ladies.  Yes.  Classy ladies.  Yes.  That waitress at Waffle Houses. 
[02:40:00]  Perkins.  A Perkins waitress.  Perkins waitress.  Not really going high end.  Like, they're attractive girls.  But not really hitting those high end girls.  He's going for the girls who you know will never drop a dime on him, too.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Right.  The Perkins waitress is all mad that she wasn't treated properly.  What are you fucking kidding me?  He didn't tip her 20%.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to continue living the lifestyle I was accustomed to. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  That was a slinging hash, you whore.  I love the fact.  Where'd you guys meet?  Well, I was cleaning the toilet at McDonald's and he walked in and invited me to his mansion,  which is bigger than the store and the parking lot.  And we had sex on the sofa.  How do you not love this guy?  Apparently, yeah.  When his wife was pregnant, just going at it with these little chippies.  Something.  I don't know.  He had such a squeaky clean image is why it's shocking. 
[02:41:00]  You know, you get somebody that, you know, when the revelation came out that David Duchovny  was a sex addict.  It wasn't like, you know, oh, my God.  He didn't have a squeaky clean image or anything.  He didn't have a lot of scandal around him.  But it wasn't like Tiger Woods is just the all-American, hey, I'm driving a Cadillac and  I got the commercials and every kid, every dad wants his kid to play golf like Tiger.  You thought it was a goody two-shoes, really? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Well, goody two-shoes under the bed.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  The question is, when does he go to rehab?  Yeah, yeah, because that's one of those.  Jimmy thinks he goes on Oprah.  I don't know.  I think he goes on Oprah.  You really think he goes Oprah?  Of course he does.  He can't do Larry King.  Larry doesn't even know.  Larry wouldn't know who he was.  Right.  Who are you?  Mr. Nicholas.  Nicholas, make sure you use the correct drinking fountain outside.  Larry.  Makes him sit in the back of the studio. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Come on, Larry.  Far away.  I think he'll do Oprah because it's by far the biggest, by far the most prestigious.  Very sympathetic, too.  Very sympathetic.  He'll explain it.  She'll ask questions that almost sound tough but aren't.  Like, well, but you knew you were married.  Why would you do this?  Like, she'll give him the reason to explain after the pseudo-tough question.  Oprah, it was such a mistake.  Such a mistake.  But you, of all people, know how great Bush is. 
[02:42:30]  Don't you just know?  Will he cry on Oprah?  Oh, wow.  Really?  Absolutely not.  That would get the...  If he tears up even a little bit.  I think he has to.  No way.  No roll.  No roll down the cheek.  Nope.  What about fills up a little bit and is like, you know...  Single tear?  Single tear.  Like Denzel and Glory?  That'd be a bit much, don't you think?  Or Demi Moore and Ghost?  Demi Moore and Ghost.  No.  He doesn't cry.  He doesn't cry.  He doesn't cry.  No, he does not cry on Oprah.  Why?  He expresses regret. 
[02:43:00]  He wears his hat.  Oh, no, he has no hat on.  He goes on as a gentleman without a hat.  You know why he might cry?  Because he knows he can't get pussy anymore after this.  Oh, it's done.  It's done.  She's watching him like a fucking hog.  He will not cry on Oprah Winfrey.  He will be apologetic.  But he's not a groveling guy, I don't think.  Well, it's reached a point where it doesn't really look good for Elan to be staring with him, does it?  Yes.  I mean, that's what I'm sure.  I'm with you, Eddie.  I mean, she's getting paid to be with him now.  Isn't there a word for that?  Yes.  Fantastic. 
[02:43:30]  It certainly is.  I'm with you.  And, you know, it's crazy that she's staying.  The thought that the price goes up the longer she stays.  You know, that's typical prostitution stuff.  The girl wants to stay longer, you've got to pay her longer.  Well, rumor has it he's up to $80 million he's going to pay her, so it looks like $10 million per war.  Here's the thing.  Oh, wow.  She'll stay with him.  Hillary stayed.  Silda stayed.  A lot of them stay.  Well, they're stupid. 
[02:44:00]  Because, but it's the power.  Power is what attracts men sexually.  It's not.  Well, you could get another fucking guy that's sort of in that high-powered position.  You can't get a guy who is Tiger Woods status, arguably the greatest who has ever lived.  And you're talking about these politicians and stuff who's white.  President.  Or president.  Yeah.  Governor.  But women that aren't really the most attractive of women.  True.  Like, she can walk out with a shitload of money and still hook up with, like, fucking Hollywood 
[02:44:30]  stars.  She could get any billionaire in the world.  True.  But I want to thank Anthony for using a term that my aunt would use.  Hollywood stars.  Hollywood.  Big Hollywood stars.  She could go out there and meet TV and screen stars.  Someone who's in the pictures.  Yes.  She just has to stand next to Hollywood and Vine.  That's where they all are.  Hollywood stars.  Find out where some of the young stars are jerking sodas.  Getting discovered. 
[02:45:00]  Hollywood stars.  What an ass I am.  Hollywood stars.  Go to the Brown Derby.  I hear they hang out there.  Brown Derby's a very good reference, by the way.  The Brown Derby.  We'll see.  We'll see what her move is.  If she does, she's fucking lame.  Even if she doesn't.  She's lame either way.  Look, I don't know what she's like.  She might be a great lover.  But again, when you have that, especially when it's the mother of your children, it's 
[02:45:30]  kind of hard to want to be filthy with her.  It's like she's watching the kids.  She's a mom.  So maybe they have an open marriage.  No, she wouldn't have hit him with a golf ball.  That's not the sign of an open marriage.  That's not the sign of an open marriage.  That's not the sign of an open marriage.  But maybe they agreed to a certain thing and all of a sudden it all came out that...  Yes, fidelity.  They're called vows.  They agreed to being faithful to each other.  And he'd put his penis in everyone making under $8 an hour from fucking here to Portland,  Oregon.  Or Portland, Maine for that matter.  I like it.  There's always so many Morgans she could give him, right? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  True.  How many winter rules you know?  Oh, I got you.  Tiger.  Tiger.  It's...  Yeah, it's an odd situation with him though.  Yeah, the squeaky clean thing.  So you say he goes on Oprah, he gives his mya culpa, and then what?  And then he goes quiet, his wife stays with him, and then the media, because he goes on  Oprah, he can shame them when they ask by saying, I've addressed it. 
[02:46:30]  I'm telling you, when you say...  Have you met the media?  That's a good point.  He could do what would shame anybody who wasn't a despicable vulture.  That is impossible to shame.  You're right.  I stand corrected.  Yeah, they won't totally back up.  Now, Andy's talking rehab.  You think this is a little...  That's the way to go these days, isn't it?  The sex rehab thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, by the way, I digress, because Rick Sanchez said that, and I want to be like him.  Uh-oh.  Why don't you...  Here you go.  It feels better.  Oh, that'll hurt. 
[02:47:00]  I watched a little bit of that sex rehab show, and there was some guy, some musician,  it was actually really good, he had his dad there, and he was talking about how guilty  he felt, because the last time he talked to his mother on the phone, he rushed her off  the phone so he could masturbate, and I was kind of laughing, but I was like, oh, I've  done that.  Did you?  Actually, I've actually rushed to get her on the phone.  But I was like, wow, man, I've actually done that, and it's such an embarrassing thing  to admit.  Man, it's just better than keeping her on the phone.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't want to do it.  What are you wearing, Mom? 
[02:47:30]  What?  A hospital Johnny.  What are you wearing, Mom?  An IV.  Nice.  I've answered the phone during sex, and had it be like, Mom, something like that, and  you're like, oh, hi.  And she says, while you're picking up the phone, I'm right here.  Mom, get off your phone.  She just rolled over and elbowed your cell phone.  Why would you answer your phone while you're having sex?  Yeah, that's the big question. 
[02:48:00]  That's weird.  Why would you answer when your caller ID comes up?  I don't know.  It's like right after, when you're still in.  Was somebody else there?  I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  Not just masturbating.  And he was cranking a sketch for footage.  They're asking, what the fuck is sex rehab?  Do they cut your balls off?  Yeah, that's sex fucking addiction.  It's got to be the top one.  Oh, it's one of those psycho babble.  You sit there, and they talk about why you do this, and blah, blah, blah.  How the fuck do you kick the sex addiction?  You have to realize what you do. 
[02:48:30]  Because you've still got to have sex after you're done.  You can't kick coke and continue to have coke.  But you can't eat food healthier, like food addiction.  So that's what it kind of is like.  It's like a necessity.  So they work on you having sex healthier.  I'm actually asking a legitimate question.  Not abusing.  I'm not bleeding.  I have a hard one now.  Why can't you have a drink healthier if you're an alcoholic?  Yeah.  Because that's not a necessity.  Like, food you need.  It says you.  That's true.  I don't know who you're talking to here.  Anthony turns into Shakespeare's McGillicuddy. 
[02:49:00]  By 10 o'clock.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, he's got to have a fucking belt of booze.  Or he turns into William Holden.  And fucking head-bust the coffee table.  Thank God Anthony's a happy drunkard.  We'd all be in trouble.  We'd all have lumps on our head by now.  We'd be in horrible shape.  Holy shit, would we?  Like a Billy Martin drunk?  Is that what it is?  It's not a necessity?  Like eating, obviously, if you have a food addiction.  Necessity.  Sex.  Yes. 
[02:49:30]  Something like that.  But wait, can't it be treated the same way?  Well...  Now, if you're a sex addict and you've had successful treatment or a food addict, which I call fat people, and they have treatment and it's successful, can't you then have an alcoholic who undergoes the same type of treatment about where this comes from and stuff and be able to just curtail your drinking?  No, because I, first of all...  It's a good question, though.  No, because the substance itself, your body develops an allergy to the substance itself, and it's like when you drink, it's like the physical withdrawal from drinking or from drugs is so... 
[02:50:00]  I would think it would be from sex.  If you're addicted to sex and can't have it, or food, too, you're big...  You don't go through DTs, detoxing from sex.  You don't have to be strapped down to a bed sometimes.  You understand?  It's a much more mental obsession.  Much more of a mental obsession than a physical...  It's more physical if it's alcohol.  I think alcohol and drugs are much more physical and mental. 
[02:50:30]  But you're also assuming that these people, and I'm sure some of them are, but I'm guessing a lot of them aren't really addicts in the sense of the word.  They're just looking for a cop-out.  Yeah, true.  I mean the sex people, not the...  I think sex addict thing...  How come single guys never go to this sex addict treatment?  It's always some motherfucker that got caught by his wife, and now, oh, yeah, I'm an addict.  I gotta go.  We got one on the line.  Cody went to sex meetings, man. 
[02:51:00]  Cody, what's up?  Yeah, I've gone to the, let's just say, anonymous meetings.  Yes.  And the meetings are complete bullshit.  What they want you to do is they want you to remain what they like to call sexually sober.  And it defined to them is including no masturbation.  There's no sex, including sex with your wife.  It has to be wife.  It can't be girlfriend.  Unless you're trying to procreate.  And I think that they're putting a little too much religious focus into it. 
[02:51:30]  And that's, hold on, let me say, I'm not going to say the name of any of the fellowships,  but that to me, there's one of those 12-step groups that involves sex that is very strict like that,  which I would never go to.  But let's just say I've looked around at a couple, at another one that does not make those kind of judgments  and talks about sexual sobriety.  So they really work the religious angle.  In some, not in the one I'm talking about.  No, I understand.  The one I'm talking about talks about sexual sobriety as being just a healthy sex life.  Like, you know, masturbation, pornography, you can get off of those things. 
[02:52:00]  Hold on.  You say a healthy sex life or whatever, but I mean, I think every single person wants a little dirt in their sex life.  You can have dirt.  The health doesn't mean...  The same, you can still have the dirt, too.  It depends on what your dirt is.  If your dirt is isolating and alone and masturbating and prostitutes, you shouldn't.  But, like, I think with your partner, whatever you guys do together, as long as you're not hurting anybody, it's fine.  It's the reason behind having so much sex, I think.  If you're doing it because it feels fucking good and you enjoy doing that, that's one thing. 
[02:52:30]  And you're not hurting anybody.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, emotionally, not physically.  Yeah, if it comes down to hurting the people around you, then I got it.  Self-destructive reason or some other reason that you're doing it, then I think it's more of a mental addiction than just having fun.  Cody, what was your poison, by the way?  It fucking feels good.  How could you be addicted?  It's great.  It fucking feels good.  Sticking my dick in a girl and back and forth repeat, it feels good.  Who doesn't want to do it? 
[02:53:00]  It's not that.  It's when I'm jerking off and my dick is limp.  And I have to go to do a set to be on stage by 9.20, and it's 10 of 9, and I'm like, just pull your pants up and get to the car.  Yeah, it gets to that point where it's a complete zone out where you get high.  It's like sniffing glue.  It's like a weird high.  If any sex addict who does that, understand.  Cody, you must know.  Cody, what was your poison with the sex thing?  Well, before I tell you that, real quick.  Young boys.  Anybody who's ever seen a movie that has had a hot girl and a sexist, you know, whatever meeting? 
[02:53:30]  Bullshit.  Don't ever fucking go.  It's a bunch of old, creepy guys that are forced to go there because they fucked a kid somewhere along the way.  Yeah, that's...  Honestly, I've only gone to men's...  I never went to one that had both because I didn't want to see it.  I didn't want to see women there.  I just wanted to...  Because with guys, it's like, I understand the guy mentality.  I don't want to look at women.  And more of them were straight.  I figured that's going to be a bunch of gay guys. 
[02:54:00]  It was really not.  I would say 70% of the guys, at least the place I went, were just straight guys with girlfriends, married, who just got out of control.  Yeah, I don't understand the mixed gender meetings.  Isn't that like having an AA meeting in a bar?  Yeah, it's true.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  He's just going for the joke, though.  Come on.  He's also making a point, though.  Let Andy have the laugh.  Temptation.  I don't know if he was looking for an answer on that one.  No, actually, I kind of was.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Cody, what was your poison, though? 
[02:54:30]  Okay.  Well, I was in a relationship and kind of was getting caught trying to get pictures of girls that I was friends with.  So I realized that it was habitual instead of just fun.  Getting pictures?  No.  A little sexting going on?  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't trying to get pictures of them like a graduation aunt.  It was fucking dirty.  No, I understand.  But that seems like, I don't know.  That's like.  No, it does seem normal.  Not that hardcore.  If you're doing it when you can't even realize that you're doing it, it is a problem. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, you know, I love my girlfriend.  Aw.  But it's also, yeah, you're deceiving the person who you actually do love just to act out and solve some other need.  Because a lot of times you find yourself doing it when you're not sexually turned on.  Like any girl I know, I would love naked pictures.  Patty.  I don't care.  I've seen her naked.  But you know what I'm saying.  Like, you do when you're not horny.  When you're jerking off when you're not horny, you're just like, you know, you want to try to avoid when it becomes an avoidance tool. 
[02:55:30]  Wait, you actually jerk off when you're not horny?  Constantly.  When you're bored.  I don't know when I'm horny.  Do you understand?  It's like people who eat, they don't know if they're hungry or not.  I just grab it because it's there.  You're going to crank because you're bored.  Yeah.  No, but he's saying because he's not horny.  Or hungover.  Yeah, but sometimes it makes you forget that you're hungover and you've got a headache.  I've been laying in bed and you're like, oh, I feel like shit.  I'm like, eh, let me do this for a little while.  Being hungover makes you a bit hornier, though.  What the fuck is that about?  It's a little weird.  Yeah, and then I just feel lousy afterwards because now I'm still hungover and I've got no energy left. 
[02:56:00]  Because you've got the fucking blood pumping too much to that headache of yours.  Want to move into Hulk Hogan?  As long as we handle it with grace.  Hogan.  And all the dignity this story deserves.  Oh, boy, way to phrase it.  Hogan's going through a nasty fucking divorce.  Hogan.  She's taking everything because, you know, she took all the bumps in the ring all those years.  No, she didn't.  He did.  Oh, literal Jim.  That's one of my characters.  He's literal Jim.  Literal Jim. 
[02:56:30]  Literal Jim.  Hulk could barely walk at this point because of everything he did in wrestling.  But she's getting, you know.  Oh, he's got to go halfway around the world so he could fight a fucking geriatric Ric Flair.  And the only reason he did that was because, you know, he's losing money fast.  He has cash.  Well, listen to what he said to a paparazzo.  Paparazzo.  The last few days.  Hey, who's the greatest wrestler of all time?  Who's the best-looking wrestler of all time?  Who used to have the most money of all time?  Man, who's still single? 
[02:57:00]  Who's still single?  That's right.  Who's too single?  Who's still single and still moving?  Now, I heard something.  AMG, I'm starting to move on.  Is it true that your wife in divorce took, like, the fixtures from the house and the toilet  seat and stuff like that?  She took everything.  Like, everything.  She took the toilet seats.  She took the toilet seats.  She took the toilet seats.  She took the sink.  She took the bathtub.  My lawnmower.  I ride the lawnmower in the tractor.  I got to maintain, cut the property.  She took my lawnmower.  She took the mops, the buckets. 
[02:57:30]  She took the dishwasher.  You got to do it on yourself now?  No, she took the washer.  No, she did take the washer and the dryer, though.  She did take that?  She does that.  She took the washer and the dryer?  She took the sink.  The toilet seat.  Come on.  Come on.  Is it real?  Come on.  Is the wife taking all that shit?  He might have just been using the expression that she took everything in the kitchen sink.  No one takes the sink in a divorce.  No one.  She didn't take the toilet seat.  Yeah, watch these phones start ringing.  I guarantee they take some weird shit.  My wife took this thing.  You're right. 
[02:58:00]  What do we know?  Was there a case where the guy tried to get the breast implants back during a divorce case?  I believe he was a doctor.  It's like, fuck, I paid for him.  I want him back now.  Yeah.  That's just being petty.  You think?  A little petty?  Yeah.  Can I have something?  Yeah.  The court said no on that one, right?  Yeah.  We got a 911 call.  That's pretty good.  It records a woman shooting an intruder.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't heard this yet.  Is it the end of Sleepy with the Enemy where Julia Roberts sees all of her cereal lined up and then now she's going to shoot? 
[02:58:30]  Was that her, Julia Roberts?  Yeah.  Okay.  I wasn't familiar with it.  Oh, yeah.  She's married to...  I was just looking, hoping you screwed something up.  No, she was married to an OCD guy who used to beat her up and then she fakes her own death and runs away and then...  I didn't see it.  Oh, okay.  Did you, Andy?  Years ago.  Yeah.  Do you know what he's talking about, Andy?  She catches her ex-husband in her house.  She comes home one day.  She's made a new life and he's tracked her down and she sees everything has been neatly arranged. 
[02:59:00]  It's actually a pretty scary moment when she sees like, phoom, phoom, all the things and she knows he's there.  And then I forget what happens.  And then they tussle.  She gets a gun and he's on the ground and she calls 911 and she's like, he's like looking at her and she goes, I've just shot or I've just killed an intruder.  And she hangs up, fucking shoots him.  And then she smiles and Richard Gere scoops her up.  She's like, why did the jizz out of your teeth, fucker?  Two movies in one.  Boo. 
[02:59:30]  Before we play this clip, CJ in Houston.  CJ.  How's it going, guys?  Hi, CJ.  On the Ultimate Fighter finale, Joe Rogan was doing an interview with Hogan talking about his new show or trying to get on to TNA and having both TNA and WWE mixing it up with each other.  And when Hogan started going into his whole thing about what you're going to do, brother, when he's, you know, whatever, the look on Joe Rogan's face was absolutely hilarious. 
[03:00:00]  Y'all ought to check out that clip.  Yeah, a lot of people are talking about this.  Rogan was pretty much mocking Hulk to his face.  Was it, yeah.  Were they talking about the names rhyme?  Oh, we're trying to get the fucking audio.  I mean, why would Hulk Hogan talk to like a...  Audio is nothing.  You guys need to get the video of it because the look on his face is fine.  Oh, cool.  Wait, were they talking about merging like Hulk Hogan doing something with MMA?  No, it was just Hulk was looking for some exposure, that's all.  Oh.  And he went on...  He and WWE are getting together.  Yeah.  Oh.  So...  I'm a Hulkamaniac. 
[03:00:30]  I'm not ashamed of it.  Hulk is just like an MMA fighter, right?  No, he's a professional wrestler.  Same thing, right?  Thank you.  Well, CJ, we'll get the clip.  Here's the woman shooting an intruder on 9-1-1 call.  There's a man at my back door.  He's trying to get in.  Uh-oh, it's too late already.  Okay, do you have a gun?  Yes, I do.  I do not have it out.  Okay.  I want you to stay...  I will use it.  I want you to stay on the line with me?  I will.  He is banging on the door.  He looks like an older man, but I don't know. 
[03:01:00]  I don't understand what's going on.  He's getting close to the door.  I'm going to go ahead and get the gun out.  It's a shotgun.  It's large.  Can you understand what he's saying at all?  Oh, she doesn't even say don't get the gun.  He's crazy.  I'm taking safety off the gun, ma'am.  He's acting crazy.  Okay, do you have a place that you can go inside your house and lock yourself in a room? 
[03:01:30]  Uh, not really.  I've got a big shot.  Did you hear the part about the gun?  Oh, crap, he's at the back.  Okay, County 13 is advising that you can defend your property if you need to.  I don't want to have to kill this man, but I'll kill him great.  They're a dead man.  I understand.  All right.  He's breaking in now.  He's breaking in.  I've got a gun on him.  He looks to be an older man.  I don't want to kill him.  God, I don't want to kill this man.  Okay.  They need to hurry.  He's going to break this thing open.  And he does. 
[03:02:00]  I'll have to kill him, ma'am.  I don't want to kill him.  I understand, ma'am.  You have to protect yourself.  I will.  Ma'am, it's about to your house.  I'm going to shoot.  Can you, is there?  Oh, my God.  Oops.  Ma'am, is your phone on the court?  I shot him.  I shot him.  I'm going out front.  I hit him.  He's shouting.  God, help me.  Oh, please, dear God.  I think I've killed him.  Please, Father in heaven.  Please, Father in heaven.  I'm so sorry, Father. 
[03:02:30]  It's okay, ma'am.  It's okay.  You have to protect yourself, okay?  He was selling something to my husband.  Yeah, right?  That audio is great.  But, yeah, but why didn't she run out the front door to begin with?  If she had a shotgun, or why didn't she just yell, I got a gun?  Or why didn't she, I don't know why.  Maybe I would do the same thing.  She's, you know, obviously she's entitled to protect her property and stand her ground,  but I don't think she's mentally capable of taking the after effects of killing someone. 
[03:03:00]  Ma'am, he's coming up the driveway.  She's like, ma'am, I'm going to kill, ma'am, I can't, there's nowhere I can go except  out the front door and into the room.  Yeah.  I don't blame her.  I might have done the same, but she's trying to touch my eyes.  And she covered her ass.  I don't want to kill this man.  Yeah.  I'm taking the safety off the guy.  She's like a blow-by-blow description.  She neglected to make that her vagina was getting wetter and wetter with every fucking screw  that popped out of the kitchen floor.  In her defense, those Bible salesmen are out of control.  He wants me to join, ma'am.  Jehovah's Witness. 
[03:03:30]  Hello, would you like to blammo?  Yeah, something about a cup of sugar and borrowing it, and it ain't happening, ma'am.  How great is that?  Some crazy old guy, so...  Ah!  Broke the door there.  Yeah, I'm surprised by the 9-1-1 operator basically saying, look, you have the right  to defend your property.  What state was that in?  I don't know.  I'll tell you, it wasn't in Illinois or New York.  Yeah, that's for sure.  Nebraska?  Was it Nebraska?  I don't know.  It was a lot of Lincoln.  No, it was not.  What happened? 
[03:04:00]  Well, you see...  What happened?  What happened?  Well, there was an intruder, and she got her gun out.  Okay, Oklahoma?  Oklahoma?  Well, that would...  Oklahoma?  It's my favorite musical, by the way.  People want to know if you're jerking off right now, Ant.  Yeah.  Did the guy die?  Yes, Ant is jerking off.  Did he die?  I don't know.  You can't do it!  That would mean we have to read the story.  Killing intruder.  Wow, he looks a little weird.  He looks like an older Chuck Liddell.  He looks like...  Oh, no. 
[03:04:30]  I hope it wasn't Chuck.  He looks like Anthony Hopkins a little bit.  From my angle.  So he's banging on the door.  Any more with the story without the...  Is that the news report or just the 9-1-1 audio?  9-1-1 audio.  He looks nuts.  He does look a little nutty.  Boy, that's...  That's the guy...  That is finally a guy that looks like the targets at the range.  I'm always complaining.  The targets at the range never look like the guy.  That's him.  Mah, Shane.  Why was he breaking in like that loud?  He was knocking.  A little crazy?  Maybe he was drunk? 
[03:05:00]  Knocking with his gun, right?  Yeah.  Is there any like...  He's really just kind of trying to knock the door down.  What the fuck?  How about...  How about some background on that?  There he is.  I'm always shooting this guy.  Yeah.  See copper?  You'll never take me alive.  It's like the old-fashioned gangster.  She shot Richard Widmark.  You know what I do to squealers?  I fall on their kitchen floor.  Sean in Georgia wants to point out a lot of things wrong with that phone call.  Sean.  All right. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  First off, Ant, how many scared old women are going to say, I'm going to kill him instead  of, I'm going to have to shoot him?  Yeah.  Banging on the door sounds like knocking.  If the window's big enough for her to see the guy and fully describe him, why wouldn't  she just show him the gun, yell out, I have a gun, and scare him off?  Yeah.  Yeah, there are...  It's a little fishy.  A little fishy, the whole thing.  She went through a full detailed explanation of every single thing she was doing.  Everything she was doing. 
[03:06:00]  And I know...  Part of the problem here is the sheriff in this county is Chuck Mangione.  Is that his name?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a busy place.  When he asked for comment, he went...  I hate that.  Who likes it?  Everyone.  And also, I know you're supposed to aim for center mass so you don't miss, but with a  shotgun, especially at that range that she sees in the house with the door, you would 
[03:06:30]  think you could shoot a little low, maybe take the legs out.  Not if he has a gun, though, right?  Well, I don't know.  Did he take the legs?  Did he have a gun?  She probably just shot the handyman.  She forgot she's fucking hiding the guy to fix the porch door.  Well, the Mr. Clean guy came in.  Yeah, he looks like that.  Well, that picture's a 2005 mugshot.  Oh, wow.  So he's clearly not Mr. Clean.  Yeah.  I think she was going for the left ear.  Smelled of alcohol and had a lengthy history of drug and alcohol offenses.  This guy's morgue. 
[03:07:00]  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you got more on this?  Yes, I do.  His name is Corey.  He's from Australia.  Yes, we have him on the phone now.  We're talking with the corpse.  I executive produce.  How's it going, guys?  Hi.  Hey, man.  All right.  Hey, I'm from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  And I actually listened to that clip a couple days ago.  And I must tell you, I want to thank you guys for playing the whole clip.  Because I heard it on the news this morning, national news.  And these guys chopped it all to hell and made it look pretty negative.  Of course.  And finally, we got some positive press on this.  You know, on somebody actually protecting themselves. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm all for it.  You know, some guy's banging on the door like that.  You don't fucking know.  You break into someone's house, you get what you get.  Andy, you ever hear the one where the guy goes,  She enticed me in my entire life.  She enticed me.  To do it.  Oh, we got one.  Travis, can you find that?  Let us know if you can find it.  Another 911 call.  Where the guy openly admits he fucking killed his wife.  And his excuse was that she enticed him.  She enticed me to do it. 
[03:08:00]  My entire life.  He's the greatest guy ever.  You're only going to want to talk to him.  And you just know the crap he had to put up with his whole life.  It came to the point where he had to do that.  She made him.  That guy has rules.  Yeah.  Is it an easy find, Travis?  Or should we get...  Oh, you got it.  Try this rules.  This is for you, Andy.  Andy Levy on Twitter.  Here we go.  North Richland Hills 911.  That's it.  Hello?  This is Freddie Wilhite. 
[03:08:30]  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  What address are you at?  8432.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's lying on the floor.  And what is your name?  I'm Hargrave.  Well, he will.  All right.  Where's the gun at?  What?  Where's the gun?  It's in the closet.  Do you really need a...  What is her name?  Donna.  Is there anybody else there with you?  No. 
[03:09:00]  Okay.  Why did you do this?  She enticed me.  And she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  He says, no.  He's right.  Okay.  And you're at 8432?  That's it, baby.  Okay.  I'm going to get somebody out there.  Where out in the house are you right now?  Well, I'm in the dining room. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know if she's dead or not.  How long ago did this happen?  A few minutes.  Okay.  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  You're alive?  You're dead.  You're what?  Paul, did you hear me?  He said he shot a wife on a sperm. 
[03:10:00]  He said he shot a wife on a sperm.  You're there?  Are you there?  Sir, I'm here.  I think she's dead.  Okay.  Is there anybody else in the house with you?  No.  I'm peaceable.  It's okay.  Okay, sir.  It's okay.  I understand.  I've got help coming up there.  I just want to stay on the line with you until they get there.  Okay, okay.  Then I'll go down.  I'm sorry?  I'll go down. 
[03:10:30]  Okay.  Okay, you all right?  We look up that guy.  I've got to see what he looks like.  Is that the greatest fucking call ever?  She entashed me.  Just calm.  He finally just had it with the bitch.  I'm at the corner of Vine Street and some other street.  She, uh...  In the stomach.  Yeah.  Are you alive?  He sounds drunk, doesn't he?  Yeah, he does.  He sounds a little...  She ridiculed me my entire life. 
[03:11:00]  Are you alive or dead?  You know, she was just nagging him constantly.  Not even saying she deserved to, you know, die.  That's no excuse.  I understand.  I think we all have learned something.  Did we?  I don't know.  She should have shut up a couple of times.  I'll tell you who learned something.  Dorothy.  Oh, Donna.  Sorry.  Or Donna was her name, right?  Whatever.  I don't know Dorothy.  Oh, is that it?  God.  Damn, he looks like the other guy's brother.  Same guy. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, that guy, he's the greatest hairdo ever.  And ridiculed me my entire life.  God, he looks exactly like he should look.  Yeah, he really looks exactly like he sounds.  Sarah from Buffalo writes,  That's not alcohol, it's relief.  Yeah.  He's finally relaxed.  First time in his whole life.  I like the fact he keeps those wispy hairs on the front of his forehead.  He's got the Jesse Ventura cut.  He does.  It's not going to get better than that, Andy.  Right there.  That's one of the best calls you'll ever hear.  I like that one.  I'll ever hear. 
[03:12:00]  That's terrific.  We have a bunch of them.  Oh, the Hulk Hogan thing.  We got the audio.  Okay.  With Joe Rogan.  Oh, good.  Joe introduces Hulk as the blonde and only.  I guess Hulk Hogan announces his TNA debut at UFC.  What is this about, Sam?  Sam is our professional wrestler.  Thank you.  Yes.  Knowledge guy.  No, you're not a professional wrestler.  You just, you know much too much about it. 
[03:12:30]  You spend too much time thinking about it.  That's a matter of opinion.  It's men fake fighting is what it is.  Well, it's a drama.  Yeah.  It's a, you know, there is drama involved.  You were going to say performance art.  He was going to say that.  You were so going to say that.  And I was going to put the frigging chair through your head.  Hey, did you ever go out there and get Bruno from Fame and see if you want to come in here  for a couple of minutes and get to sit down?  Okay.  It's my son's music.  Okay.  But there's some athletic competition involved as well. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, yeah?  We're not paying attention.  Yeah.  I was just looking at Tiger Woods number 10.  Just walked by.  Jesus Christ.  Big log hanging out like an oxtail.  Oh, lonely dream.  Why don't we just play the audio?  We don't need to spend a lot of time on wrestling shit, Sam.  You understand.  Of course I do.  All right.  It is my honor to be here with one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.  Sports and entertainment.  Huge personality.  The one and only Hulk Hogan. 
[03:13:30]  Welcome aboard, sir.  How are you?  Thank you, my brother.  You know, to be here with Joe Mania, Dana White, it doesn't get any better than this, brother.  These guys are going to war out here.  It's unbelievable.  Now, you've been to some MMA fights before.  Are you a UFC fan?  Oh, I'm a huge fan, my brother.  I sure am.  My brother.  First of all, Hulk's wig, it looks like broom bristles.  What are you doing?  Yeah, because now he's wearing the bandana, but he's got, like, extensions hanging out  the back or something. 
[03:14:00]  It looks terrible.  I think he adds some to the sides, right?  That's got to be from...  From the back, it looks awful.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, that's...  He did add some extensions.  Of course his hair or something.  Joe Rogan's got the haircut from a boy's life.  Yeah.  He's got the haircut from a boy's life.  What's what Rogan doing?  Tell him that and then he'll fucking snap your arm.  Joey!  Joey's hair cut like the guy with fucking Pepper the dog.  He looks...  Rogan looks like the gay friend.  I hear Joe fights for the ping team. 
[03:14:30]  All right, now he's going to hit you first.  That's good.  Thank God.  Joe lives in Denver.  Good luck shoveling out.  He can't hit me until fucking April.  He moved to the fucking snow country.  Rogan tweeted that he was high as shit right before the interview.  Of course he was.  Nice.  Thank you, Mike, from Hoboken for that little tidbit.  Of course.  We don't expect nothing less from the guy.  Rogan does like his weed.  Can I see that video again?  I want to see fucking Joe's do. 
[03:15:00]  I can't believe he's such a nice guy haircut.  What is he doing with that?  His hair.  He looks...  He has hair like the guy that killed Harvey Milk.  Fucking...  Rogan should be shooting Harvey Milk.  He's a psycho.  Click on play there.  Let me just see him move a little bit.  I announced a partnership with TNA Wrestling and its president, Dixie Carter.  Yeah, wait.  That's this clip.  We could just watch it up here.  Now, I understand that you have recently announced a partnership with TNA Wrestling and its president, Dixie Carter.  And you're going to be moving to Spike TV. 
[03:15:30]  We're going to see some Hulkamania on Spike TV.  Tell us more about that.  Well, you know, brother, tonight I got a ton of energy.  And I'm partners with Spike.  I'm partners with Dixie Carter.  I'm partners with TNA.  And we just got the green light, brother.  Green light?  On January 4th, TNA Impact.  We're going wide open.  We're going head on head.  We're going to battle with a WWE.  Monday night.  We got the WWE.  On January 4th, Hulk Hogan and TNA.  What's wrong with Mildo on that?  We're coming after everybody.  We're coming after everybody.  Now, I understand that you have... 
[03:16:00]  You recently released a book.  You've done a wrestling tour in Australia.  When are we going to see Hulk Hogan wrestle in TNA?  Well, brother, I'm going January 4th.  Like I said, Monday night.  We're going to war TNA Impact.  But you never know.  I'm going over there to take over.  The maniacs are coming.  All the TNA stars are going to be there.  And you never know when the old man with the yellow boots might just step in that ring, brother.  Hulk Hogan is coming back, ladies and gentlemen.  TNA Wrestling live on Spike TV. 
[03:16:30]  Hulk's here for the fights.  You know you want to watch him on TV.  What you going to do, brother, when the UFC runs wild on you?  What are you going to do?  That's the difference.  I don't know.  Pepper!  That was some great improv.  That's fantastic.  What are you going to do?  Oh, poor Joe.  I want to see fucking Hulk's head going back and forth over a car as it fucking goes through a wash.  The old bristled dude.  Couldn't come in and see us because you're a shitty publicist.  Nice hair, dick.  He'd promote his fucking daughter's shitty music. 
[03:17:00]  And the least he could do is come in here.  Oh, wow.  Looks like bendable spaghetti strands.  His hair is enragingly awful.  Al dunte.  Yeah, Sam, why isn't Hulk on our show?  Yeah, why, Sam?  Point.  Why don't you fucking explain that one?  He's probably, he's a publicist.  Publicist?  He's upset that you kept Brooke Hogan 20 minutes late.  Oh, yeah.  God forbid we promote her shitty music for an extra minute or two.  Where'd she have to go?  Yeah, she had to get on one of the huge stations we got around here. 
[03:17:30]  So she couldn't spend 20 minutes on this station.  She probably had to go do...  Out Cue?  Yeah, Out Cue and some random show on Hits 1.  Yeah, correct.  Want to take a break?  What's Steve DeSantra?  Jesse Ventura, Bring Back the Music Remix.  I don't know what this is.  D-Boy made it.  So it's got to be good.  Whatever it is, it's fucking alcohol-fueled.  Whatever it was, he did it drunk in his basement alone.  His fucking awful...  His fucking man sandals.  You're not a Cuban model, stupid. 
[03:18:00]  Stop wearing fucking open-toed sandals.  Fucking...  Are you mocking, D-Boy?  His awful...  His awful, like, fucking...  What are they called?  With a fucking strap that goes over the foot.  A mandle.  It's called a mandle.  Is it really called that?  Yeah, like a bisexual Cuban.  They're flip-flops.  They're not flip-flops.  They are flip-flops.  They are flip-flops.  Was that D-Boy?  Yes.  A rare appearance from D-Boy.  Exactly.  Fucking...  Damn.  He's fucking wrestling with a tequila arm.  Flip-flops. 
[03:18:30]  What he does going down the stairs.  Not flip-flops.  D-Boy, there's a lot of Lionsgate films coming out that look pretty good.  Yeah, which ones?  Isn't the Brothers one?  It's going to be shit.  I'm telling you.  He has an aversion to Lionsgate films.  Oh, really?  He just will not see him.  They're not like that.  And I've never heard of anybody choosing their movies based only on the distributor.  It's the movie at the distributor.  Why do you...  I don't remember.  Why don't you like Lionsgate?  It just happens to be that every movie that looks really good and then turns out to be 
[03:19:00]  shit comes from Lionsgate.  He's got an answer, at least.  He'll have an answer for anything.  Well, what are some of those movies?  Give us a list.  My God.  I mean, all the Saw ones were released by Lionsgate.  The first one's good, right?  The first Saw, good.  Yeah, but all the other ones after it are pretty bad.  All right.  What are some of those other Lionsgate films?  Oh, I have no idea.  I mean...  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah.  They're very forgettable.  You just know them when they come up.  Yeah.  Could we get a list of Lionsgate films and see if D-Boy's onto something? 
[03:19:30]  Please.  Exactly.  No, I'm serious.  You don't think he's onto something.  He's on something.  He just might be onto something.  We'll find out after the break.  We're going to play D-Boy's little piece going into break.  We got Andy Levy from Red Eye with Andy Levy, one word, on Twitter.  Tonight, Andy will be on, of course, with Norton and a lot of other people.  Andy's on every night doing the pregame, the halftime, and the postgame reports.  And I told him, it's one of those bits.  When I saw it for the first time, I got really mad.  I'm like, God damn, is that fucking smart and clever.  We should fucking steal that.  Well, they did something smart where they put Andy right up front, too, kind of just 
[03:20:00]  mentioning a couple of the topics that were going to be talked about.  It just, it works.  It's good.  In a whimsical way, Jim.  Yeah, I mean, he throws Huber around the way so many of us throw around nickels and dimes.  Don Corleone.  You hold all the jokes in your pocket.  Exactly.  Why not share the wealth?  We're not necessarily stealing a bit if Andy actually does it for our show when he's here.  Oh, really?  Make him work. 
[03:20:30]  Maybe after the break, he does a little postgame for us.  Maybe a few observations.  How about you go on their show and do something?  It's true.  Andy's made a few appearances already.  Bill and his fucking...  I'm going to fucking collect some placemats, and I'm going to go on that fucking show.  Bill's vagina bag showed up.  I'm going to be on that show with my knowledge, which is my placemats.  Do a maze.  When is Godfell's book coming out?  Not until next year, I think.  A book?  Yeah, I won't talk about it until it comes out, because then everybody will rush to Amazon.  What the hell is he writing about?  Is it his experience at Fox, or is it a growing up thing? 
[03:21:00]  He's quite the prolific author, Anthony.  I think this is his 23rd book.  Wow, that's amazing.  The first 21 were all about living the same life as Sonny Wurtzik and Leon Shermer from  Dog Day Afternoon.  21 books on that.  It was really overkill.  He wrote about Marmalade, Jimmy.  One page book.  Yeah, he did.  That's my subject.  The History of Marmalade.  Obsessed with Marmalade.  By Greg Gutfeld.  You're obsessed with Marmalade.  Hey, we got the Lions game films? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, he's out of his mind with Marmalade.  What year do we go with?  Oh, they only kicked...  All right, so you got...  American Psycho.  American Psycho?  You didn't like that?  What's wrong with American Psycho?  Read the book.  Who wants to see that dumb movie?  I liked Marmalade.  I liked Marmalade.  I liked Psycho.  Book was better.  Book was great.  Fralty was a good movie.  Dogma?  What's wrong with Dogma?  I mean, you're bound to hit a couple of gems and all you do.  Shit.  I mean, they had Traffic also.  Yes.  And it won an Oscar, so... 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, Traffic was good, right?  Wait, look at the list.  They did American Psycho 2.  Hold on, though.  Look at the list.  With William Shatner.  D-Boy.  And tell us which ones looked like they were supposed to be good in their circle.  Exactly.  Here we go.  The Cube, I don't know, looked good and maybe sucked.  The Rules of Attraction looked good and sucked shit.  It was gut-awful.  Okay.  Let's see.  The Cooler was good.  House of a Thousand Corpses sucked.  The Cooler was really good.  Oh, you'll get an argument out of that.  Shattered Glass was good.  Alec Paul was great in The Cooler. 
[03:22:30]  I don't remember half of these.  Dirty Dancing Havana Nights.  Ooh, that was a really good one.  Who's in that?  Who's in that?  The Punisher?  Yeah.  Who's in Havana Nights?  I don't even know.  Oh.  That was the...  All right.  This is a crappy...  Believe me, dude, there's a lot of them.  Yeah, all right.  You make your point.  You backed up your point.  Yeah, you certainly did.  I'm looking, just going, this is horrible.  Oh, Pinocchio 3000.  Wow.  You made your point.  You made your point.  Don't mess with me, man.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Let's just go break.  Hard Candy was good.  Oh, all right.  Is that the one with the chick with the photograph?  Yeah.  That was a good one, right?  Sexy as shit.  There he is again.  Worst hairdo ever.  Look at this.  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  Kumar Pachuri.  It's like he killed an animal with a hammer and just threw it on his head to keep it dry.  It's like a skunk.  It's the worst.  He's got his beard.  Rajendra Kumar Pachuri.  He's on CNN.  Probably as an anchor.  That fucking hairdo.  He has something to do with global... 
[03:23:30]  That has to be a wig.  Yeah.  But it's like a triangle wig.  That is horrible.  I love his hair.  He's a scientist.  Yes.  I imagine.  Natural Born Killers was Lionsgate.  Damn, guys.  Like I said, they're bound to have a few good ones every now and then if it is on there.  But the high percentage is shit.  High percentage is shit.  It's like 95% shit.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We go to break with this.  I hear the music.  It gets into you.  I hear the music.  Millions of watts.  All of this low-level sound. 
[03:24:00]  Well, it gets into you.  And so I said, well, you know what?  I hear the music.  Bring back the music.  All of this music.  Well, you know what?  I hear the music.  And so I said to him, I said, bring back the music.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  And so I said to him, I said, wait a minute.  I hear the music.  Wait a minute.  I hear millions of watts. 
[03:24:30]  And so I said to him, I said, you all talk a big thing.  They only talk it.  You don't walk it.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  billions of watts going up into the ionosphere.  You hear it through the front of your skull.  I hear billions of watts.  You hear it through the front of your skull. 
[03:25:00]  Going to do a little wrap-up here.  Homeless shopping spree, let's not forget, a week from this Thursday.  Oh, yeah?  On Twitter, it's OAHSS to follow what's the latest on the homeless shopping spree.  We should put some more info up there today.  Andy Levy's on Twitter.  It's Andy Levy, one word.  That's not people.  People aren't going shopping for homeless people.  No, the homeless go shopping.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's an amazing fucking fit.  Yeah, okay.  They walk into stores and try on clothes for the horror of the store owners. 
[03:25:30]  It's wonderful.  There's never been a violent incident or an unpleasant incident.  People chant and they cause a ruckus, but it's fun.  There's no stores have been hurt.  They treat the homeless like human beings.  And it's amazing how many of these stores are elitist scumbags.  It's like the homeless really all are block stars.  They actually start pulling the gates down as the homeless start walking toward their store.  It's classic.  And a couple thousand listeners show up and there's buses.  And it's just a great event for the Christmas holiday. 
[03:26:00]  Jimmy, what happened?  We tried to get that blogger on the phone.  Kevin Eck.  Is that his name?  Something like that.  Which, as most of you know, is a powerful name in media.  And Kevin Eck blogs about wrestling people.  Listen.  You better watch out.  Your life will never be the same if he blogs about you.  He didn't want to give us any further publicity by mentioning the name, which is fine.  We're happy giving you some more.  We tried to get him on the phone.  Honestly, not to sideswipe him, but really just to ask him, why would you do that without really investigating it? 
[03:26:30]  And his wife apparently answered and said that he had just woken up and he was too groggy.  Oh.  I believe was the word that was.  It was groggy?  That's what I heard, that he was too groggy to come to the phone.  That's smart.  That's how you're going to get your career to big places.  So we left.  You had a chance to talk to, I don't know, at least a million people today, but you're too groggy.  We left the number to the hotline, but apparently.  He's still groggy? 
[03:27:00]  Grogginess.  Yeah.  Is still there.  Maybe, hopefully, if his grogginess were his wife.  His wife just fucking threw him under the bus, man.  Oh, Kevin's groggy.  Whoever she was.  Whoever the girl was.  It might have been his mom.  He just came out of surgery?  That's like the only time you ever used the word groggy.  He's still a little groggy.  You better wait until he's out of recovery.  All right, we're calling him right now.  Let's give him a call.  Let's just say, has the grogginess passed?  Has said grogginess passed? 
[03:27:30]  But he said if he was in Jesse's position, he would have punched it, Jimmy.  Oh, that's scary.  Someone that's groggy trying to punch.  I wouldn't like that at all.  Maybe he's groggy from beating up a lot of people.  He perhaps went on a big beating fest and became groggy thereafter.  Groggy.  Went to answering machine.  See, he's chicken.  He's scared.  Well, just call and say, we'd like to know.  You were real brave in your blog.  Well, that's... 
[03:28:00]  How in the same position...  If you were in the same position as Jesse, you would have had to swing at Jimmy.  Real brave.  I honestly didn't want to yell at the guy.  I wanted to turn him around.  But that...  We would kill him with our intellect.  But to me, that is...  That, in a nutshell...  That happens.  Never.  We'll kill him with our intellect.  Yeah.  We watch.  That is what a blogger is.  We surprise people sometimes.  To me, that's why I dislike bloggers.  Because we say, do you want to come on?  And look, if he comes on and we're dicks, then he should hang up. 
[03:28:30]  But to not even come on and attempt to discuss it, I would...  I would be on a hostile radio show.  Goddamn bloggers.  Yep.  They bring down property values.  That's right.  Hate the bloggers.  And we tried to get Rick...  And I would say...  I don't know if Kevin Eck is on...  Twitter.  But I know Rick Sanchez, I believe, is RickSanchezCNN on Twitter.  Oh, yeah?  So, you know, follow him.  Maybe he's an interesting guy to follow.  I imagine he is.  Following him better than being in front of him.  Yeah, he sure is.  Apparently.  Exactly.  He feels like Tiger Woods Tree if you're in front of him. 
[03:29:00]  He's not.  What?  Interesting to follow.  Oh, is he boring?  What's Kevin Eck's thing?  His Twitter is ringposts.  Trey.com slash ringposts.  R-I-N-G-P-O-S-T-S.  Ask him about his grogginess.  And what other things it affects in his life.  Poor guy's groggy.  Groggy?  It happens.  I've been groggy.  I've been groggy, too.  You get jet lag, you're groggy.  Alexa Ray Joel was groggy.  She was groggy after...  What?  Taking fucking asparagus pills? 
[03:29:30]  Great.  Another...  What did she take?  Another cry for help.  Ugh.  Is there anything worse, Jimmy?  I don't fault her because she's only...  She's young.  She's 23.  I want to die.  Wait, Anthony, could you, like, reenact the Alexa Ray Joel for me?  It's one of my favorite things.  That was her...  Where you have to get the whole family involved.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Just fucking...  I took some pills.  How many?  Oh, my God.  You took how many...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  There's a bottle...  What do you mean you don't know?  How many pills did you take? 
[03:30:00]  I don't know.  I just want to die.  The bottle's here and it's half full.  How many pills did you take?  It's half full or half empty, depending on how you look at life.  Right now, I'm thinking of it.  But I was there.  There were a few.  I took a mouthful and I drank some alcohol with it, too.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  I'll be right over.  Make believe I give a shit.  There was a man of Shevitz and a couple of pills. 
[03:30:30]  I'm not sure.  Either that or they were PES.  It's a cry for help.  Help.  We're always like, why would you call 911 if you want to kill yourself?  You don't do that.  No.  Also, why would you take homeopathic sleeping pills?  Yes.  They said there's no way she could have killed herself with these pills.  Like Flintstones chewables.  I'm not a fan of the cry for help.  Are you, Andy?  No.  You're a fan of the cry for help?  Look, if she's depressed. 
[03:31:00]  Where everyone has to get involved and drop everything they're doing.  I mean, if she's depressed.  Look, and I guess he tried to kill himself in the 70s, didn't he?  No, he's older?  Yeah.  He's battled depression his whole life.  So, you know.  Really?  I get that.  But don't.  Half a bottle of homeopathic sleeping pills?  Yeah.  Half a bottle?  Yeah.  What supplement did he try to kill himself with?  First of all, if you're trying to kill yourself, who are you leaving half the bottle for?  Are you just being polite?  Take the bottle.  Throw your cell phone out the window, and then take the whole bottle of pills, and then 
[03:31:30]  we believe you.  Yeah, you've got to make sure you smash the cell phone, rip your phone out of the wall.  And maybe spring for an actual prescription.  Yeah.  Don't go to GNC and, you know, get some Valerian or whatever.  Stephen asked for Bayshore, just rinsed with scope, send an ambulance.  He's a little nervous right now.  That's his cry for help today.  Cry for help.  Well, poor girl.  She is, you know, she's young.  She's an ugly girl.  She felt jilted.  She's supposedly a very nice girl, too.  Yeah, but she's ugly. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, man.  She's ugly.  It's brutal.  She's horrendous.  If your mom's a supermodel, you should be at least a five.  Well, it's just the problem is she got screwed.  She looks like her dad.  Right.  Which is just the worst look ever.  Those big bug eyes.  Your mom looks like she looks.  But she's definitely not ugly.  I don't think she's ugly.  She's not at all.  She looks good there.  You know what?  She looks like a glamour shot.  Show a regular shot.  Let me see the bug.  I'm sure all of this is helping her with the depression, by the way.  Nice job, guys.  Yeah, yeah, this is great. 
[03:32:30]  Just talking about it.  You don't think that's ugly?  Honestly, no.  Not at all.  No, no.  I mean, Christy's better looking at someone.  Christy's a supermodel.  She's going to be better looking at that view.  She's a cute girl.  Her pussy smells.  What?  She just has that look.  What?  Oh, my God.  You're awful.  I can't believe you're turning me into a hole on this radio show.  I would say it's probably difficult to have two parents that famous. 
[03:33:00]  You think?  Yeah, man.  I mean, look, unless you're doing what one of them is doing and she's trying to sing,  she hasn't been able to get a record deal and her boyfriend dumped her.  Maybe she's, you know, look, I'm not saying it's right, but that happens.  She's got, look at all that talent.  She didn't get either side of it.  I don't know if she's a good singer.  She didn't get the looks to be the model and she didn't get the talent to be the next  fucking Billy Joel.  Pilly Joel?  I know.  Pilly.  I kind of did say Pilly Joel.  It kind of worked out in my favor, that one.  I don't really think we need a next Billy Joel, by the way.  Yeah, that's true.  I think one was quite enough. 
[03:33:30]  You weren't a big Billy Joel fan?  What's wrong?  Growing up, I was on Long Island.  What's your favorite song?  I like the one about jerking off, Captain Jack.  I liked moving out when I was moving out.  Yeah, it was a good song.  Vroom, vroom.  I love Down Easter Alexa.  For real?  I do.  Yeah.  Anthony?  Captain Jack will get you high tonight.  Nah, I think, you know, something, New York State of Mind is pretty good.  Actually, yeah.  That's a good one, man.  J.C. remaking that fucking song.  How dare him.  Also, Brenda and Eddie's are good, whatever, it seems to be Italian. 
[03:34:00]  Restaurants are pretty brilliant songs.  Fucking Billy Joel is great.  What are you going to say?  What about a bottle of...  Anything off The Stranger, I think.  Yeah, yes.  I celebrate his entire collection.  Catalog, excuse me.  Shit.  That's all right.  How about the Ballad of Billy the Kid?  Oh, now you're going, you know.  I don't know that.  Heavy rotation on BAB.  No, that's deep track shit.  I do like the Ballad of Curtis Love.  Bob Buckman.  Yes.  Bob Buckman.  The Q and the D coming up. 
[03:34:30]  This is the Ballad of Billy the Kid.  We all remember this.  Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.  Billy Joel is a completely different entity than he was.  Like, some people look like older versions of themselves, and then other people just turn  into completely different people, and Billy Joel turned into a completely different person.  It really is amazing.  When I saw him backstage a few years ago, the only time I've ever met him, he was in between,  it was when he was touring with Elton, and Elton was on, so Billy was just chatting, and  he was eating.  Me and Bob Kelly tried to bond with him. 
[03:35:00]  It was really humiliating, but he stood there, he had a big bag of fisherman's friends, and  he was just chewing them.  I guess that's how he keeps that, like, whatever you need for your voice.  Yeah.  Maybe that prevents his voice from getting fucked up while he's waiting.  Long story, was really, the amazing thing was, it didn't even have the promise of a pay-off.  I saw him eating cough drops, news at 11.  You told a Billy Joel eating cough drops story.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  By the way, song, not historically correct at all.  Why not?  Took a lot of criticism for that.  For what?  This song.  What song is this?  About Billy, about Billy the Kid.  He made him a legend in his time.  And it's not historically accurate.  Yeah, he's all right.  It's great.  He's aight.  Billy Joel's aight.  Billy Joel's a very nice guy.  Piano bars all over Long Island.  You'd find hack versions of this, and many other Billy Joel's.  Piano man, look, it's slightly overplayed, but it's a fucking brilliant song. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  You know, dude.  Where from Long Island were you from?  Smithtown.  Smithtown.  There you go.  A little bunny in the levy.  Wow.  There you go.  No.  Do you just say that, but you mean King's Park?  No.  Smithtown.  Smithtown.  What did you do before you did that?  Apparently not the part you know about, though.  Well, the part I knew about, I knew some chick that lived on, like, Landing.  Okay, that's there.  Yeah, that was the richer part of Smithtown.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  No.  Not my part.  Not yours?  No.  We were solidly middle class.  Were you, like, you know, where town is, 25?  Yeah.  Not far from there.  Not far from there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, you poor guy.  You know, high school east?  Yeah.  If you know where that was.  Which one did you go?  Did you go to high school east?  I walked to east.  I live right down the block.  Ah.  But they're the ones that always painted the bull's balls red for graduation or some shit.  Across from Frog's Place, the strip club.  Yeah.  I love Smithtown.  You got it.  Come on.  Fuck, I forgot about that joint.  Yeah, I used to go there. 
[03:37:00]  I haven't seen the bull or that strip club in a long fucking time.  I don't think the strip club is still there.  Probably not.  I'm not sure, but I don't think it is.  I used to do all the stupid air conditioning work at, what was that, St. John's Hospital  up the road?  Yeah.  So, yeah, I did a lot of work there.  And during lunch, we'd all hit it down at the strip club.  Andy, what did you do before Red Eye?  Were you a comic or did you do a journalism?  No.  No, I was, for a while, I was one of those bloggers you love.  I don't, honestly, I don't dislike bloggers.  Um, my, my dislike of bloggers is the ones who will just blog and then fuck and then 
[03:37:30]  hide.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, bloggers who, like, are comfortable discussing what they write about is fine.  Right.  But, no, I only did that for a little while.  I, uh, well, I was in, I was in the army for three years.  And then I, uh...  Stop it.  Exactly.  Biloxi Blues incident?  No.  Okay.  Did you ever serve your country, Jim?  I actually did.  You know what?  Shut the fuck up.  Just shut the fuck up.  I did serve my country by not joining the military because I'm what's known as a coward. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, shit.  You would have got a lot of people killed.  Cowboy.  No, but you know what it is, though, man?  Well, you know, I actually was never in the military.  But when I was over in, uh, when I was over in Iraq, in the war zone, you know what it's  like over there.  Or you've heard.  I mean, I spent some time over there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ricardo Sanchez and I zipping around on the plane from Kirkuk to Baghdad, you know, a  member of all Allied forces.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, you know, entertain the troops, give them something to fight for.  We have a little...  Surrounded by people that fight. 
[03:38:30]  Men, the word you look for.  Yeah.  Even the women.  And you tell your little jokes and leave.  Yeah.  I really did.  I really did throw it.  I did a little soft shoe.  And then left the men for the fighting.  I was like the fucking strippers in Apocalypse Now.  Exactly.  I knew where you were going.  Yeah, like the cowboy cheerleader.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some guy fucking threw a flare over his head.  And I put on my fucking, my bunny ears and then got fucked in the extended version  by a chef.  Could you wear the wig?  Do your little six-gun shooting thing. 
[03:39:00]  Dude, that is a cool fucking scene, though.  It's fantastically sexy, man.  That really is.  I used to jerk off to that scene a lot.  No shit.  You jerked off to the fucking part where they chopped up the cow.  That's true.  It looked like a vagina in the back.  They teach young men to drop fire on people, but they can't ride fuck on their airplanes  because it is obscene.  He wrote, he was reading a poetry book called The Golden Bough. 
[03:39:30]  What a great poetry book he read.  Wow.  Damn, I never noticed the title of that.  How could you not?  He threw it at his fucking Dennis Hopper.  And then the library was looking for him.  That's why he was hiding in the fucking, in Cambodia, off the Nung River.  The library wanted the golden bough.  He wrote a fucking horrible poetry.  Yeah.  That's a great poem.  They teach young men to drop fire on people, but they can't ride fuck on their airplanes  because it's obscene. 
[03:40:00]  What a great, I wish I had thought of that.  Let's go to Matt in Queensbury.  Matt, are you really friends with Alexa Ray Joel or whatever her name is?  Yes, that is correct, gentlemen.  How do you, how do you, how do you know her?  He's friends with her the way that guy was friends with Uma Thurman.  He just stalks her.  The guy that this story revolves around is from my neck of the woods.  I grew up playing in bands with him and stuff.  Okay.  So I met her through him.  And I was just calling, mostly to say that, you know, a lot of the pictures that they're  showing are pretty unflattering. 
[03:40:30]  In person, she's, you know, she's pretty, pretty, pretty good looking girl with an amazing  body.  Yeah, well, the problem is, like, she would be a good looking girl if you had an average  mom, but your mom's fucking, you know, Christy Brinkley, that makes it, that's the problem.  And someone writes, Puddle of AIDS writes, maybe Alexa Joel is depressed because when  you do a Google search, Alexa Ray Joel, the first word in autocomplete is ugly.  Is it really?  No.  That can't be good when you're Googling yourself.  No, she's not. 
[03:41:00]  Believe me, in person, she's a knockout.  Puddle of AIDS, her music, you know, I grew up on Kiss and Aerosmith and Zeppelin, so  it's not my kind of music, but she's a very talented singer and songwriter, you know, and  she's trying to do it all on her own and not living on her dad's coattails kind of thing,  which is why she's still just like an independent artist.  Really?  You know, she has a fucking multi-million dollar bank account.  I think she's cute.  But she's doing it on her own.  I do too.  Well, I mean, as far as making it a music business, you know, I'm sure she's getting help to survive. 
[03:41:30]  Can I ask you this?  Can she close her eyes?  Uh, yes.  Okay.  Yes.  But anyway.  All right.  I don't ask for much, but I would like this.  She has big eyes.  Yeah, maybe she doesn't want to just write her father's name.  They're a bit on the googly side.  I mean, that is her name, Alexa Ray Joel.  No, it's fucked up.  Maybe she doesn't want to ride his coattails.  Every other picture that Danny shows us, she's really fucking hot.  And then the next picture, you're like, well, but not that one.  Not so much.  And then it goes back to another hot picture.  It's easier to fucking take an ugly photograph of an attractive person than to take an attractive, 
[03:42:00]  consistent photograph of an ugly person.  Is that from the poetry book?  That was...  That's actually...  That's actually when I scream at myself in the mirror when I'm fucking fighting, actually  running warm water in the tub and fucking wrist shaving.  I yell that at myself.  Jim, it's the ugly pictures that are wrong.  You do have a chin.  All right.  She's hot when she's not smiling.  I finally figured it out.  Is that it?  Yes.  Real hot when she doesn't smile.  Puts on that serious kind of sulky, sultry side. 
[03:42:30]  That picture's brutal.  Wow.  That smile...  All right.  Now go back to the page.  I'll tell you why that's not a good picture.  Because her hair...  The way she has her hair and her bangs is wrong.  Retard bangs.  Well, she shouldn't have those bangs.  She's trying to cover up a really big forehead.  Is she?  I want to say, at least we're not shallow pieces of shit.  Yeah.  The girl's depressed.  I have to point out, I'm not comfortable with this conversation at all.  Yeah.  We're terrible.  She's really depressed that we're saying her hair looks better like this.  Well, look at the forehead she's trying to cover up.  But that's a better picture.  What is it?  She should advertise her latest CD on that forehead. 
[03:43:00]  She's cute.  Oh, see, that's not necessary at all.  Check out the music, though.  I mean, it's kind of like Nora Jones.  It might not be something you're into, but...  Give me a song that you know very well.  Well, her new single is called Invisible, which is...  She was trying to...  Maybe she's trying to do to herself.  On YouTube, they have her performance from your favorite, the Wendy Williams show, doing  that song.  It's a good song.  Let's hear it.  We're going to take a listen to that.  On YouTube, Invisible?  Yeah.  By the way, I said it off air, and I'll say it on air, just in case anybody doesn't like 
[03:43:30]  it.  Madonna's new video is fucking kick-ass, man.  I hate to say it.  Don't say kick-ass.  Hey, fruit.  It's what?  You've said it three times already.  You're not on the show, I haven't.  Flaming homosexual.  No, I'm not.  The fact that I'm wearing a little sailor outfit, as I say, and I have a flower in my  hair is irrelevant.  But you said kick-ass.  When your mom is supermodel Christy Brinkley, and your dad is superstar musician Billy Joel,  it's only a matter of time before you end up in the hospital. 
[03:44:00]  And that is exactly where our next guest is now.  She's here to sing her single, Invisible, for the first time anywhere.  Please welcome singer-songwriter Alexa Rachel.  Jesus, no one else wanted the performance, huh?  Thank you.  Thank you.  I feel nervous, probably.  They say it doesn't matter.  There's an invisible mind.  We never got it right anyway. 
[03:44:30]  I think the keyboard player is a little intimidated.  Hey, I've met a big guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not bad.  I always hear when she kicks in.  And she looks really good.  She looks really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too processed.  She sucks.  No, she doesn't suck, man. 
[03:45:00]  She's not.  Look, she won't be the prodigy your dad is, but she doesn't suck.  No.  She's not Billy Joel's daughter.  She's not on TV singing this song.  It's not good enough.  And you know a little something about fucking process.  Remember, everybody, vote number three.  Vote number three for her.  American Idol.  This does sound just like...  In all honesty, I don't know as much shit about this as you, but her, right?  That chorus was very processed and overdubbed, and it was drowning her out.  Yes.  Yes.  You say you're moving on now.  What's going on? 
[03:45:30]  I gotta let it go.  This is not healthy anymore.  I'm not even sure if she's singing this.  Really?  Not sure.  All right, I figured it out.  The right side of her head is horrendous.  What?  The left...  Look at that.  The left side, hot, right?  Watch when they show the right side, though.  Look.  Thank you.  They did it for me. 
[03:46:00]  The right side of her head is fucked up.  Where's the voice in that, Jimmy?  For real.  There's so much processing on it.  Say it again, that's...  She's not singing this, by the way.  You might be right about that, actually.  I don't think she's singing this.  You think maybe she's lip syncing?  Yeah.  All right, well, then maybe, after the process, maybe...  Too much process.  This is the album version.  It's, like, really produced and everything.  Like, but, like, I noticed she's too on fucking key with everything. 
[03:46:30]  There's no difference when she moves off mic a little bit.  So it's her first TV appearance.  So to protect her, they lip synced.  All right.  Doesn't sound bad, though.  Oh, she's lip syncing.  That wasn't fucking synced up at all right there.  Yeah, she's tying her shoe right now, actually.  I ain't got no problems with it. 
[03:47:00]  No.  I ain't got no qualms with the girl.  It's not my style of music, but it's not...  I got no beef.  It's not bad enough to shit on.  It's a little heavy for my taste.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean, I'm saying it's not a little bit of angry and devil or shit.  Like a little lighter.  Tell Danny if he doesn't find Madonna's song, I'm going to kiss him on the mouth until the  cows come home.  He's not going to find it now.  I know that.  That's why I said it.  That's average at best, guys.  Come on.  Well, she's Billy Joel's daughter.  Yeah, I know.  Expect more from Billy Joel's daughter.  There's probably a lot of pressure to be Billy Joel's daughter. 
[03:47:30]  Maybe she's good at driving.  That would be like something.  You can't make money off being a good driver unless you're a NASCAR.  Yeah, maybe.  Could be a problem.  Maybe she got that.  What is this?  Now, remember, Jimmy said it kicks ass.  It's phenomenal.  She's kicked ass.  I heard it's phenomenal.  I'll say this.  She's 50 years old.  I understand that, but you can say it's a good song.  Don't start making excuses now.  It's called celebrate, I think.  You said kicks ass.  She's fucking 50 years old. 
[03:48:00]  It's a good club song.  Again, it's not the style of music.  There's all the closed minds in this room.  Official video.  Oh, closed minds.  Here we go.  Let's see.  Let's watch a song.  Can I see it, Dan, so I can enjoy the ass kicking?  Watch a song that Jimmy says kicks ass.  This is the advertisement.  This is the ad.  They're advertising my show in Kansas City this Saturday.  No.  Florentine.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  Jim Florentine.  Two mediocre comics. 
[03:48:30]  Kansas City.  Uptown.  Here we go.  What's this song called?  Celebrate.  Celebrate.  Yeah, it's just a good video for a 50-year-old lady.  You look familiar.  You want to dance?  Yeah.  Come join the party.  Yeah.  Let's get this started.  You.  Yeah.  Dude, she's a 50-year-old woman.  I don't care.  That makes it even sadder. 
[03:49:00]  Why?  She looks good.  Listen to this.  It's club music.  It's not my style of music.  This is not bad.  This is a good club song.  I think you want to come over.  Yeah, I heard it's a great band.  You wouldn't fuck Madonna.  She looks great.  Dude, I can't.  They haven't shown her in one shot for any longer than a billionth of a second.  I like this a lot.  There's a reason for that.  Do you like this?  And they're doing some video trickery.  Opie's just leaving.  Opie just left the studio.  He's at it.  This is great for a 50-year-old woman. 
[03:49:30]  I'm telling you, this is a very good video.  I don't care how old she is.  Look at her.  She's grabbing her pussy.  You can't even see.  I'm starting to wish Jesse Ventura had kicked your ass.  All right, look.  I understand the consensus of the room.  And it's very over.  When they show her, it's overexposed.  Yes.  So they got the white background.  It does.  That cures the world of ills.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that the video itself is the video is a cool video.  I don't think it is.  How do you say that?  Oh, jeez.  That velociraptor leg arm. 
[03:50:00]  So we got a black guy doing all kinds of...  It's just a bunch of people dancing, really.  Acrobatics.  I think it's a good video.  And she's...  What's so good about it?  Because, again, it's a fucking, like, a young, hip club video from a 50-year-old woman.  And I guess I'll tell you why I said that.  Because I watched it right before Britney's new video.  And it was such garbage Britney's video.  And I'm like, look what she's doing.  What is happening to you? 
[03:50:30]  Where were you watching this?  What gay club were you in?  A woman.  What's that?  A woman turning these things on.  He saw this before the Britney...  Yeah.  I saw this.  And then you...  How was the Jonas Brothers video?  Was that good?  Did you finish up with Lady Gaga?  I did, actually.  The new video where she's wearing the fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to fuck Lady Gaga.  But you went Lady Gaga, Madonna, and Britney.  Britney, one listening session?  Lady Gaga, by the way.  I have to compete with her in the Borgata.  Oh, goodbye.  January 15th and 16th.  Jesus Christ.  She's doing the fucking Saturn in the event. 
[03:51:00]  Poker or Blackjack?  What's that?  See, it's a casino joke.  I don't get it.  Yeah, neither did I really.  She's not that hot these days.  Don't worry about that.  I like her clit.  I don't care what her head looks like.  Jesus.  I don't care if she's wearing a fucking Fender hat.  Well, at least...  I'll understand that I'm in the minority in this room.  Everyone thinks I'm a fucking flaming homie.  At least it's not Ozzy.  Because that's all you usually talk about musically.  So that's good.  Yeah.  You're expanding your taste.  The song is not like...  Look, it's an average punk song.  I get what you're saying, Jim.  I'm just not going to say it on air.  We're done, right? 
[03:51:30]  She's, uh...  Oh, yeah, we're done.  No, that's not a buttery beat.  Got a fucking, uh...  Buttery beats are different than Madonna songs.  Watch the new Britney video.  How fucking uninspired and awful...  Like, when you look at where she petered out in her 20s and just stinks now...  Well, I think this Lady Gaga, if you want to get into it,  made Madonna get off her fucking ass.  Maybe.  You know what?  Maybe.  What the fuck is Lady Gaga doing?  Might act.  I got to go back out there.  Who who?  Who who is ripping her off?  Possibly.  The problem with the video, now that I'm back with the show here, Ant,  you kind of said it. 
[03:52:00]  Like, it's so many cuts, so you can't really see Madonna.  But I don't mind that.  Because she knows she's got problems with her body at this point.  Yeah, it's like a choppy, weird video.  And she's wearing huge sunglasses, because her eyes certainly look 50.  Yeah, but that's the style of the video.  The rest of us don't.  That's fine.  It doesn't matter.  I still like it.  I like Ray of Light.  I'm a Ray of Light Madonna guy.  I'm not going to lie.  I also like her version of Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.  And La Isla Bonita.  Andy, what's your favorite Madonna song?  I go Ray of Light. 
[03:52:30]  Did you ever dance for your country?  That's right.  That's right.  Were you an electric boogaloo?  I was.  Right, pal.  And admit one Madonna song you kind of like.  What?  We all did.  We just heard that one.  Except Randy Levy.  I can't really think of any.  One.  One that goes, all right, it's all right.  Papa Don't Preach?  You're a Papa Don't Preach type of guy.  Are you kidding?  Come on.  Did you see the video to that one?  I don't know.  You think I'm going to like that?  I don't remember.  Jesus.  You should like Like a Virgin.  Vogue? 
[03:53:00]  No.  Yeah, you're a Vogue guy.  No.  Do you justify my love?  What was the one?  Probably Material Girl.  What was the one from the movie Tell the Tale?  I think I like Material Girl.  All right, Anthony likes Material Girl.  I like Ray of Light.  Jimmy mentioned his.  Andy, it's up to you.  I'm blanking on the name of the song.  It's from a movie.  I think Lenny Kravitz actually wrote the song.  Oh, that's.  But I'm completely blanking on the name of the song.  We're moving on up to the Jefferson's theme song.  I love that.  His mother was Roxy Roker.  I love that.  Sung by Janet DuBois of Good Times.  You wish you knew that.  Really?  I wish I didn't. 
[03:53:30]  No clue.  Why are we still here?  I don't know.  Why am I giving out old lady facts at 10.  51 a.m.?  I feel like I'm trying to be interesting around a bunch of old women and bombing.  All right, plug time.  What do we got?  We got Andy Levy on Red Eye Every Night with Greg Gutfeld.  Yes, on Fox.  It's on Fox News Channel.  Midnight West Coast, 3 a.m. East Coast, but just DVR if it's too late.  I'll be on tonight.  And I'm on.  I got to do Kansas City with Jim Florentine this Saturday.  I believe the Uptown it's called. 
[03:54:00]  And then Borgata January 1516.  And let the record show that Rick Sanchez did not come on our show today.  No, we tried that guy Kevin Eck twice.  Right, so there you go.  A lot of brave guys out there talking about our show, but not willing to back up their shit.  Yep.  See you guys tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
