<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with significant technical difficulties affecting the audio.  Once resolved, the show launched into a discussion of President Bush's State of the Union address, focusing on his delivery, Nancy Pelosi's reactions, Dick Cheney's health, and the variations in coverage across different news channels.  This transitioned into a heated debate about an antique store owner on Madison Avenue who sued a homeless man for $1 million for sleeping on a heating grate outside his store.  Opie showed more sympathy for the homeless man, while Anthony defended the store owner’s actions.  The discussion included listener calls offering diverse perspectives and detailed the store owner’s subsequent rerouting of the grate's heat.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the movie *Hound Dog* and the controversy surrounding a scene depicting what is perceived as child sexual abuse.  This segment involved Bill Donahue of the Catholic League, who was criticized by the hosts for his reaction without having seen the film.  The hosts also discussed Dakota Fanning, calling her a "phony" who maintains a childlike public image while allegedly behaving differently in private.  This led to comparisons with Drew Barrymore's career trajectory.  The discussion also included a significant segment devoted to Donald Trump's calling them "two slobs" in the New York Post.  The hosts questioned Richard Johnson's reporting, played a clip of a previous phone call with Trump highlighting inconsistencies in his statements, and speculated about Johnson's motives, suggesting a possible drunk driving arrest. They announced their plans to postpone a full response, preferring to gather more information first.  This segment also featured Louis C.K. as a guest in studio, who along with Bill Donahue, participated in discussions about both *Hound Dog* and *Lucky Louie*. The show also promoted a video contest sponsored by hotmovies.com.

A phone conversation with Bill Donahue followed, focusing on his criticism of HBO's *Lucky Louie* and *Hound Dog*.  Donahue's criticisms were challenged by the hosts and Louis C.K., who highlighted the inconsistencies in Donahue's stance and used derogatory terms towards him. Donahue, in turn, employed what the hosts perceived as deflection tactics and hypothetical offensive scenarios.  The hosts further criticized Donahue, referencing the child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. The conversation continued after Donahue's departure, with further discussion of *Lucky Louie*'s upcoming DVD release.

A later segment centered around Melinda Doolittle's American Idol audition, with the hosts and Louis C.K. offering crude commentary on her performance and stage fright.  This transitioned into discussions of a radio show mimicking their format, a listener's report about a Donald Trump commercial, and a family removed from an AirTran flight due to their three-year-old daughter's behavior.  The hosts and Louis C.K. expressed strong, vulgar opinions about the parents and flight attendants.  The segment also covered their upcoming "ONA Traveling Virus 2" tour, confirming Louis C.K.'s participation, and concluded with a discussion on childhood spankings, including Louis C.K.'s personal experiences.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls detailing their experiences with childhood physical discipline, ranging from mild spanking to severe beatings.  Callers shared stories highlighting the psychological impact of this punishment. The debate included discussion of a proposed California bill banning spanking children under three, the effectiveness of physical discipline,  parenting styles shown on nanny shows,  and the hosts' personal experiences with difficult relationships and marital conflict. One caller recounted an incident involving underage drinking and inappropriate behavior with babysitters. The segment concluded with a listener's poor karaoke performance of "I Saw the Sign."  Mentions were also made of a Buffalo, NY promotional event involving strippers that resulted in FCC complaints.

Finally, a segment promoting "Whip'em Out Wednesday" detailed instructions on accessing online stickers and mentioned sponsors Bodog and iliketolisten.com.

[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failures, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a war fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee, oh, do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Northen, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled for, 
[00:00:30]  why are you crying, the virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy, you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the Opie and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the USA, I hate you, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road, 
[00:01:00]  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Uh, damn you.  I gotta change my buttons.  What's the matter?  I'm not really...  Well, is that better?  No.  No?  No, I can't hear me.  How about that?  That's good.  What's different today?  No, it's not a replay, we're here live, it's just the way, uh... 
[00:01:30]  Well, there's different settings on the board, and some of the other shows here in New York like the, uh, the Stern setting.  Is that it?  Yeah.  We hate the Stern setting.  We have our own setting, but it's not labeled.  Uh, how about...  No, that's not gonna work.  That was an echo.  Uh, where's Tim?  Help me, Tim.  All right.  What do you feel is wrong?  It's too tinny?  Yeah, it's too tinny and bassy at the same time, if that makes sense. 
[00:02:00]  That's impossible.  It's just, uh, a lot of stuff coming at ya.  I hear distortion.  Tim, which one is me?  Program?  It is that one, right?  It is.  Now I gotta crank, because I don't hear me.  How's that?  Wow, now I'm thinking that the other setting is good.  All right, whatever.  It's, uh, Whip'em Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Jesus.  I know.  This old gag, uh, I don't know, we're not gonna spend a lot of time on Whip'em Out Wednesday  because most of the cities we're broadcasting to, uh, well, it's a little cold for women 
[00:02:30]  to be flashing you as you drive to work.  They're frozen over.  But you know what?  It's something that, uh, continues to happen all year long.  And of course, I acknowledge that West Palm Beach is nice and warm today.  I acknowledge that Las Vegas is, uh, nice and, nice and warm today.  And Dallas, you never know with Dallas.  It could be, uh...  It could be frozen or warm.  You just don't know at times with Dallas.  But, uh, Whip'em Out Wednesday is a fine, fine Opie and Anthony promotion.  You gotta get your WOW stickers. 
[00:03:00]  You gotta get your homemade WOW signs.  You gotta write WOW on the back of your truck or the back of your car in the dirt.  And basically, that, uh, alerts the women.  Yeah.  It alerts the sleazy women.  No, I'm just kidding.  There are lovely women that do this.  Over the years, we've had moms and, uh...  A little bit of everything.  Yeah, a little of everything.  Well, they see the WOW.  They know it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  They know it's the Opie and Anthony show.  And they will flash you.  Yeah.  All we ask is you do not harass the ladies. 
[00:03:30]  Just let them do it.  Let them give you a little, a little freedom.  Let them let freedom ring.  Right.  You get the little peak.  And everyone goes on their way.  That's it.  And then you move on.  Right.  Simple as that.  So, uh, most of the stations that we're on, they're motivated.  And they got a way of, uh, getting you the WOW stickers.  Other, other stations that we're broadcasting to, they just expect us to do everything and  do all the heavy lifting.  Yeah.  So, uh, I don't know what station you're listening to us on.  But hopefully it's one that, uh, is motivated enough to, to try to get WOW stickers to you. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Get some stickers out there.  Whether it's through other radio shows on the station or, or promotions or, or just  as simple as going to the website and clicking on something and sending an address in and  they send out a WOW sticker.  That would be great.  All right.  But it is whip them out Wednesday.  Get the WOW stickers on your cars and your trucks.  Did, uh, did you happen to, um, watch the, uh, president last night after American Idol? 
[00:04:30]  I like how it was promoted like a, like a show.  It was like, catch the president's State of the Union address right after American Idol.  What?  Really?  Uh, too bad you can't get like Simon and Randy and Paula.  To critique his, that was awful.  As he's going.  That speech had no substance.  It was horrid.  He was all over the place because, uh, now with the Democrats came in, in charge, um, he  couldn't just, you know, blah, blah, blah, terror, terror, terror, freedom, terror, Iraq, war, 
[00:05:00]  terror.  He had to throw in other stuff, which he hasn't like touched on in years.  Remember every other president, I brought this up before, every other president, there  was clip after clip on the news through their entire administration of them seated with  an open like leather book and the pens and they would sign things and they would hand  the pens out and get another pen and sign something. 
[00:05:30]  By the way, you know how much of a president working.  But you know how much of a pain in the ass that has to be?  Oh, I know.  To sign your name, but you got to use 10 or 15 different pens.  Try it at home.  Stop your signature and pick up another pen and continue.  Do they teach the presidents how to do this?  Yeah, there are times that where you would just sign a little bit of your name, another  pen, sign the rat a little bit more, another pen.  That way they could give out the pens as this was the pen used to sign such and such a bill.  But they don't tell you there was a hundred pens. 
[00:06:00]  He gives you a hundred pens, he's just like that one dotted an I, this one crossed a T.  Yeah.  So, but you remember like Bill Clinton, you would see him doing that all the time.  I don't know what the hell he was doing, but that was what, that's just the president's  job.  Sit there and sign stuff.  You never see Bush do that.  All you see is him on TV talking about the war.  That's, that's like his whole gig.  So, uh, this state of the union, uh, the first one with the Democrats in charge there and 
[00:06:30]  Madam Speaker behind him, Nancy Pelosi.  Oh, she's just sitting there smiling, rubbing, like gnawing the lipstick off her lips.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her.  She was just like someone's mom got in and sat behind the president and she's just sitting  there like biting her lip and, and like scraping the lipstick off her lips.  Yeah.  And another limp wrist, a little ding, ding, ding, ding, the president of the United States. 
[00:07:00]  There she is.  Yeah.  Like, look at her just gushing, smiling.  He said something, uh, you know, Bush said something, acknowledging her, the first woman  speaker and she got all misty eyed.  I was getting misty eyed as well because I'm, I'm sitting there getting chills thinking  she's, she's second.  She's like, well, she's three.  I mean, number two.  Number two is Dick Cheney.  But I mean, yeah, besides the president, uh, yeah, here's, here's what I saw number two 
[00:07:30]  do last night.  I don't know how many people caught this.  Did you see him coughing?  And then very discreetly, he put his head down, he grabbed something, popped it in his  mouth and looked back up.  I think he was putting nitroglycerin under his tongue.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  Well, who, who isn't amazed that he's, uh, he's lasted this long.  No, no, no, no, no, he's the bionic man.  Who is a, who isn't amazed?  They just chase him around with medical personnel and defibrillators are with him and he doesn't 
[00:08:00]  carry luggage.  It's like medical equipment.  Yeah.  And, uh, so she, so she's behind him, you know, and, uh, Bush comes out, acknowledges it and  then starts talking about like things that he hasn't talked about in years.  He threw everything in there.  He was talking about the war obviously.  And, uh, but, but then he started talking, uh, now, Opie, what are you going to do, Jimmy?  What are you going to do to cut our fuel consumption by 20% over the next 10 years?  That's what he wants now?  I think it was 10 years. 
[00:08:30]  Wasn't it 10 years?  20.  There's no way you're cutting fuel consumption by 20%.  By 20%.  That's a bold statement.  Ain't, ain't going to happen.  That is called a distraction.  It's exactly, he's, and he's talking about the thing, you know, we got to get, uh, the  plug in cars, plug in cars, uh, electric, uh, cars, uh, the fuel based on, uh, methane,  corn, corn on the cob, cars that run off corn on the cob. 
[00:09:00]  And you're just like, shut up.  You're a lame duck.  First of all, you're out.  It doesn't matter.  Then I like how he goes, I have a plan.  I'm going to enact that is going to have a balance to budget in five years.  It's like, well, you are out before that.  So what do you think people are going to jump on board this?  Like all your other ideas are going to be great that all the Democrats are going to go, this  is great.  We got to like, even though, you know, we'll, we might have a president in the white house. 
[00:09:30]  Um, we definitely want this to go through.  Yeah.  So the applause also the applause from the, uh, left side.  If you're looking at the president, the left side, as opposed to the, uh, right side, just  nothing.  They, they sit on their hands.  The whole left side is like, ah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  And it's just crickets from the other side.  They don't, they don't care.  And it just shows you like you watch that.  They can't even get behind an idea, you know, together. 
[00:10:00]  Both of them.  Because the wrong person came up with the idea.  Yeah, exactly.  So that, a Democrat comes up with that same idea up there.  Oh, the Democrats are, oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  You just realize there's no getting along.  There's no cooperation.  So the, the wheels grind away very slowly.  Uh, expect absolutely nothing to get done for the rest of Bush's term.  It's just, nothing's going to happen.  No one's going to sign off on anything.  It's just, it's done.  The lame duck.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And then if they get a Democrat in there as president, stuff might get done, whether  we like it or not is another thing.  But, um, the state of the union was all over the place.  And, uh, when he starts talking about the war and more troops and even the Republicans  were like sitting there going, all right, I know I, I'm obligated to do this, but this  is a tough one.  Well, thank God for DVR because, uh, the speech was on what, 89 channels last night?  Yeah, of course.  Everybody needs their version of this?  Yeah.  I don't get that. 
[00:11:00]  There are different, uh, versions.  Let me tell you something.  Fox's version, which I was watching, uh, didn't seem to show Hillary and Obama a lot.  Really?  Yeah.  Because, like, it's kind of giving them air time, I guess.  Uh-huh.  But then the CNN version had a few camera cuts that, like, showed more of them.  I don't know how they did that.  I think it's one feed.  I think they're able to choose, pick and choose which cameras they're using.  Yeah.  At any given moment inside there.  But it was odd.  Like, they didn't want to show Hillary. 
[00:11:30]  It was halfway through and they pop Hillary and Obama on there for a second on Fox.  These people are going to say I stoned for them.  Oh, my God.  I can't be bothered.  Complicity.  I just can't be bothered.  It's the same crap every single time.  Yeah.  It's, you know.  I watched it a little bit and then I just couldn't take it.  Nancy Pelosi.  Yeah.  Someone's bringing this up.  I noticed this, by the way, Vinny.  Blinking a lot.  What was that about?  She's blinking away.  She got the twitch.  She got a little twitch.  Got a little bit of a twitch.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Apparently, I didn't know.  What was she? 
[00:12:00]  Some soccer mom until she was, like, 41 and then decided to get into politics and now  she's third in line to the presidency.  That's pretty impressive.  She's third person in.  See what you could do, America?  See what you could do?  Third in.  All right.  I was watching Idol.  Yeah.  I watched American Idol, of course.  Then I have I Love New York on DVR, so I had to watch that.  That's way more important than the president's speech.  What the hell is that?  You don't know why I love New York?  No.  New York from Flavor Flav? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, I'm so done with that.  Yeah, no.  It's the spinoff show on VH1?  No.  It's pretty funny, man.  Is it?  Yeah, it's all right.  It's not bad at all.  I don't watch shows that I experience just walking down the streets of New York on a daily basis.  You don't walk around New York on a daily basis?  Okay, drive.  You drove a block yesterday.  That was because-  Or a half a block.  Poe brought my vehicle out front of XM, and we had to come back here for a meeting. 
[00:13:00]  And yeah, kind of just drove down the road, so my car would be out in front of here in New York.  Who was the client again?  The wonderful people at Hotels.com.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, right on.  Yeah.  We have no problem with Hotels.com, but we were on a conference call with a bunch of other talk show hosts from around America.  Yeah, let me give you-  And we had to listen in. 
[00:13:30]  I'll give you a quick briefing, though, on this, because when we do these, usually, if it's by conference call, it's one-on-one.  It's an Opie and Anthony show, which is us two sitting there in a conference room in front of that little conference call thing, that little Star Trek thing on the middle of the table.  And then we talk to the client, the sponsor, whatever, the agency, a few different people we can talk to.  This one was different.  But all of a sudden, they had a roll call, and there's people beeping in, and there were 20 people on the line from different stations all over the country talking with, like, this agency that handles the sponsor. 
[00:14:00]  And most of them had a voice like this.  Yes, I'm here from Miami, Florida.  Yes, my audience loves this product, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all just lapping.  So they're spelling out their strategy.  And they were fine.  They were completely fine, because I know Tom's probably getting nervous down the hall.  No, no.  They were fine.  They were doing what they had to do. 
[00:14:30]  We had to listen to make sure we're all on the same page.  They spell out what they want, and we listen.  And you know what?  We have very busy days.  We want the meeting over with.  We want to go right home.  Just get to the facts of the matter, and we will absorb it.  We'll do our job.  Everything will be dandy.  And then there's just do-gooders that have to be heard.  Oh, speaking of that, I got a question that's going to take 10 minutes to explain.  People with questions.  Oh, shut up.  And one guy chimed in, and I swear to you, he goes- 
[00:15:00]  I got to call him out.  I believe it was Jay Severin.  Really?  In Boston, yeah.  I don't know who it was, but he is the biggest dude.  Maybe someone listening to us on WBCN can help us out.  Is Jay Severin the guy that does a lot of hiking?  Speaking, this guy came across so pompous during this phone call.  There was no reason for him to chime in at all.  You know, we're talking with the people from Hotels.com, and it's all about Hotels.com. 
[00:15:30]  And if you have a question about that and how they want to present it and stuff, that's fine.  But he chimes in and goes, I got to tell you something.  I'm a big, with his voice, I'm a big hiker.  I do a lot of hiking, and I fly-  Well, my audience knows that I'm going to be gone six weeks out of the year, and that  means I'm climbing a mountain somewhere, whether it's in Switzerland or Colorado.  They just know I love my hiking.  He's like, I do a lot of hiking, and let me tell you something. 
[00:16:00]  I fly first class.  I stay at the four seasons.  Dude, what a pompous ass.  Yeah, he goes, I only fly first class, and I only stay at the four seasons.  But let me tell you about Hotels.com.  I went online, and I checked it out, and I was amazed by what I could do with the four  seasons hotel.  Not only that, here's how it was presented.  I'm a big climber.  I do a lot of climbing.  I only fly first class, and I stay at the four seasons.  I was in, I grew up in Aspen. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, that's right, yeah.  And let me tell you something.  I went on the website and found magnificent hotels in the Aspen area.  And let me tell you, you had me at Aspen.  I forgot about that.  And we're sitting there drop-jawed.  I was sitting there staring at the contraption on the conference table, wanting to punch it  because of what this idiot, it all of a sudden became nothing. 
[00:17:00]  It wasn't a question.  He didn't have a question, he didn't have a question, he wanted everyone on the conference  call, because there had to be 30 friggin' people on the line.  Easily.  Wanted everyone to know that he hikes, that he can afford first class, and the four seasons  hotel, he hikes, he's been to Aspen, he grew up there, so he's so familiar with it.  I know all the hotels in Aspen, and when I punched it into Hotels.com, the quality of  hotels that came up just stunned me.  You had me.  He actually said it. 
[00:17:30]  You had me at Aspen, and we're just thinking, you had me at ass, because that's what you  are.  And Jimmy, I can't tell you how many times Anthony was diving for the mute button.  Oh, because there's a button on those things.  And we're live.  We can say whatever we want.  And everyone will hear us.  So the green lights are lit when we're live.  And then when you hit a button, the red lights are on and start blinking.  So they can't hear us?  And it lets everyone in your room know that they can't hear us.  So our sales rep that was sitting there with us. 
[00:18:00]  Brian.  Brian's a good guy, man.  He clicked it off so the red lights are on, so we could listen but discuss a few things.  And then we click it back on to acknowledge certain aspects of the meeting.  And then I go, you better just click that back off, because I'm looking at Opie just gearing  up to go, or say something.  He started laughing at everything everyone was saying.  Well, because they were all so hacky.  So I started like, I was just like this in the background. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  It was like the subtle version of the obnoxious laugh I did on the show.  I'm like, shut this off.  Shut it off now.  Yeah, but then they did roll call.  And Opie and Anthony, are you excited?  And Anthony gets on and goes, yes, I'm very excited.  Well, do your part.  Oh, I had to give it right back to this guy.  It was right after his whole thing on climbing and stuff.  I go, yeah, I got to tell you, I'm a pilot.  I'm a pilot.  I have my own plane.  I was born and raised in Hawaii.  I'm also an astronaut, and I've been to the moon. 
[00:19:00]  And let me tell you something.  I went to Venus, and I was checking out Hotels.com, and I got to tell you something.  You had me at the upper stratosphere.  And they were laughing, and you didn't hear a peep out of that douchebag that said.  In all fairness, you definitely got some laughs.  Oh, but most of.  And you deserved the laughs.  Jimmy, it was really funny.  So uncomfortable.  But most of these people are just like, you know, what is he doing?  Yeah, I heard, like, one person go, who is that, Opie or Anthony? 
[00:19:30]  Like, and someone went, it's Anthony.  Yeah.  And then the rest of them, just silent, like horrified that I was just mocking this douchebag  hiker.  Oh, he's just a.  Is this him?  He's just a pompous douche.  He looks like a tool.  Did he talk about anything in his private life about.  Hold on, let's go to Steve in Boston.  Steve, he might have some intel.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I'm out in Boston.  I'm a huge fan of you guys.  But it's so funny because I talk about J7 all the time. 
[00:20:00]  The guy is just the most pompous ass.  Like, if he was pompous on the phone, I bet he was a hundred times more pompous on the air.  The guy is just such an ass.  Is he a hiker?  Yeah, I guess he's a hiker.  So I don't listen to him much.  But I heard something about his personal life, too.  Like, something to do with him being gay or something like that.  Now, it says, although his on-air persona heavily suggests he's a bachelor if Severin  has been married since 1997.  Yeah, we don't know if the guy's name there. 
[00:20:30]  His show is called Extreme Games.  The status of his show at WTKK Extreme Games.  What the hell is that?  I don't know, but it does sound like the name of something for somebody who hikes.  Oh, man, after listening to him for a minute and a half, two minutes.  Let me tell you something.  I do a lot of hiking.  And we're looking at the little gizmo in the middle of the table going,  where's this going?  Where's this question?  What the hell is he doing?  Why is he wasting time?  He's wasting everyone's time just to let everyone know what a guy he is. 
[00:21:00]  Ugh.  All right.  Just getting started.  We got lots to do today.  Man, I'm trying to turn Anthony around with this bum on Madison Avenue.  Nope, you ain't going to do it.  You got to hear what the owner of this antique store did.  God bless that antique store owner.  If you've been following this story, see, with our show, we keep track of these stories.  We present them to you, and then we see how they end. 
[00:21:30]  And if you remember, there was a bum sleeping outside in the cold over a grate that was keeping  him warm.  The antique dealer on Madison Avenue said no way and decided to sue the bum for $1 million  because he doesn't want him anywhere near his antique store.  Good for him.  Run the business.  The story gets pretty good today.  And I can't turn Anthony around.  I want to see where Jimmy lays with this one.  At this point, I'm less turned around than you could have gotten me when the story first  broke because of the new details. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  We'll get into that next.  Also, you're listening to two slobs according to Donald Trump.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, we're slobs.  We are really not surprised about this.  Donald's just taking on everybody.  But we made page six in the New York Post today.  You want to be on page six, I guess.  It's the place to be.  And we're getting a little print in page six today.  A little link.  And Donald Trump is kind of saying that he'll never call our show again.  Yeah, because we're two slobs.  And he's calling us two slobs. 
[00:22:30]  Like I said, no surprise here.  We'll get into that in just a few minutes as well, okay?  Yeah.

[00:23:30]  Paul, what's going on today?  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning, Paul.  Hey.  Uh, listen, when I beat cancer, the doctors asked me, how'd you do it?  I said opie and Anthony and then radiation, which is, you know.  Oh, well.  How about that?  Yeah.  Congrats.  Thank you.  Listen.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What kind of cancer?  Ball cancer.  Ow.  What?  I had the nut cancer.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  How about that?  How about that?  They took the right one.  Well, good thing. 
[00:24:00]  They took the wrong one.  Then you'd be left with none.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Here's what I want to tell you.  Did you guys see the New York Negro on the speech by Bush last night?  Yeah, the subway hero.  He called that Azu Pep out.  He stepped up and he was pointing to everybody like he was accepting a Grammy for best rap  performance.  Yeah.  It was hilarious.  The subway kook, we like to call him on our show.  He's the, you might remember him a couple weeks back, the subway hero, some kid had 
[00:24:30]  a convulsion, fell on the train tracks, the subway tracks.  He dove onto the tracks, covered them with his body as the train rolled over both of them  and they both emerged unscathed.  Right.  This guy was invited to the State of the Union address last night.  I think, there we go.  There it is.  We're seeing a clip right now on the news, actually.  Everything we talk about ends up right on the news.  They point out a lot of people during the State of the Union.  A few people, military people, family, special interest, you know, or what do they call 
[00:25:00]  that?  Human interest story people.  And they all get their applause and then they sit down.  You're done.  It's not about you.  It's the President's State of the Union address.  What's key, they keep applauding until you sit.  Yeah, until you sit down.  Right.  And then that's it.  That's just how they do it down there, right?  This jackass would not sit down.  He is standing there with his arms in the air.  Yeah.  Just doing the Rocky up the stairs move. 
[00:25:30]  And everybody's, they keep clapping.  He's pointing at people like he knows them.  Yeah, he's like, he's kissing his fingers like his fingertips and then pointing at people  like, yeah, yeah, you, yeah.  Like he's like, he's picking up a source award.  I was going to say, it looks like he just won a gold medal at the 1972 Olympics.  Fellas, thanks for taking the call. 
[00:26:00]  You have a great day.  And Jimmy, take it in the rear.  See you.  Oh, all right.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Take care of yourself there, fella.  It's like, it's like being in a 767 when you're in his situation.  Yeah.  It's two engines, you know.  One can go out and you can still land perfectly, but you really want to keep tabs on that one  that's running.  Yeah, you sure do.  You're running one nut, my friend.  Be careful.  Well, here's the headline.  Plot to bum out hobos.  So we've been following this story.  This guy, he's a homeless gentleman.  Yeah.  An older homeless gentleman. 
[00:26:30]  Out of nowhere, he decides to leave his entire family.  I think they were living in Denver.  And he shows up on this grate outside this antique store.  Yeah, where the heat comes out of.  About a week, a week and a half ago.  That's what the bums do around here in New York City.  They sit on grates.  They do it in every city.  Where heat pops out.  Yeah, in the cold cities.  Where heat pops out.  And they stake their claim.  And it doesn't matter if it's in front of your apartment, building, front door, a store,  anywhere.  And let me tell you something.  They aren't walking around searching for restrooms in the middle of the night either. 
[00:27:00]  So this guy's got heat, and he's got a restroom, which is this antique dealer's front door.  That's what they do.  They go into the doorways and stink it up with their bodily fluids.  Oh, just leave the homeless guy alone.  Get him out of there.  Leave him alone.  So Carl Kemp.  Ugh.  I hate Carl Kemp.  Carl Kemp.  So look, obviously he had a problem outside his antique store.  Of course he did.  I understand that much, okay? 
[00:27:30]  Well, but what turned me was when he decided to sue the homeless guy for a million dollars.  He figured he needed a strategy.  Telling this guy to move wasn't helping.  Calling the police wasn't helping because they can only do so much.  Their hands are tied when it comes to the homeless.  So he thought, let me sue this guy for a million bucks, and at least when he has to end up in court and he doesn't go to court when he gets a summons, then they could put him in jail because he's not answering a summons. 
[00:28:00]  So he started the ball rolling to get this guy away from the front of his place of business.  I commend him.  How funny would it be if he sued the guy and the guy showed up with a check and had it and then just paid the million and camped out.  There you go.  I'm still going to sit here.  It goes, now what?  Now what?  One of those kooks with a bunch of cash.  Now what, tough guy?  So this has been playing out in the papers for the last week or so.  Here is the latest.  Plot to bum out hobos. 
[00:28:30]  Hobos?  Isn't that a derogatory term for the homeless?  What paper said that?  Well, it's the telling news.  That's like the homeless version of the N-word.  Yeah, you can't say that.  You can't say hobo.  The temperature above a Madison Avenue sidewalk grade has plunged 70 degrees in the past week.  But for once, the recent cold snap wasn't to blame.  Listen to what Carl Kemp.  Carl Kemp genius, I am calling him.  Carl Kemp ass.  Carl Kemp super genius. 
[00:29:00]  I like the way that sounds.  My reference, yeah, I should have went with the 1968 Olympics.  They got a sports writer calling me out on that.  Oh.  Very, very good there.  Mo from Brooklyn.  All right.  Antique dealer Carl Kemp, who made headlines after slapping 64-year-old vagrant Roger Greenlee with a $1 million lawsuit last week,  cut off the hot air to a steam grate yesterday in a bid to drive away the homeless from the front of his store.  Is that great?  Contractors hauled away large metal heating ducts yesterday morning after rerouting the 109.9-degree air from the basement boiler to a locked alley behind the store in Madison. 
[00:29:30]  Bravo.  The guy's brilliant.  How brilliant is that?  All right.  You like the heat that's pouring out in front?  I'm going to take it away and pipe it out back to a locked friggin' alleyway.  Can't you at least admit that Carl Kemp is a douche?  Carl Kemp is a genius.  He's a douche.  I'm digging this guy.  He's a go-getter.  He knows how to make things happen, like make homeless disappear. 
[00:30:00]  I'm going to take it one step further.  He should have had carbon monoxide coming out.  Pumped out.  And then invited them all.  And then just had, like, a homeless treat stand.  I can't bring you on my side there, Jimmy.  No, I'll tell you why.  Because I think it's just a smart thing to do.  It's like, that's the problem.  They're standing there.  It is right in front of us.  Like, when you look at that little teeny grate, it's like, it looks like he's selling an old man.  It's the smart move.  Carl Kemp was always smarter.  I mean, literally, this guy is, it's not like it's a big store. 
[00:30:30]  It's a little storefront.  It's a little storefront.  That's just like the common sense way to do it.  It's like, he'll find another great to stand.  But you know the guy's just an ass, Carl.  You just know Carl Kemp is not a nice guy.  I'm digging Carl Kemp.  He's just not a nice guy.  And the other twist to this is the fact that this homeless guy has a family.  The family's been found.  Yeah.  Take care of your friggin' nut job homeless dad then.  He doesn't want to be taken care of.  Because he's crazy.  This isn't a movie about a homeless guy. 
[00:31:00]  The lovable curmudgeon.  This is a smelly, crazy homeless man that needs the family to help him.  I like to think that Robin Williams is under that big coat.  That big winter coat.  You'd like to.  I like to think.  Nick Nolte is under there.  Actually, the guy looks like the cover from that Jethro Tull album.  Yeah, he's Aqualung.  He is Aqualung.  The once toasty grape beneath Kemp's window, a mainstay for Greenleague,  and at least three other homeless people named in the lawsuit, 
[00:31:30]  had cooled to a near-freezing 38.9 degrees.  They put a little thermometer in the news.  Got this digital thermometer.  How cold is the grate?  Well, they like to just.  Go find out.  They're just nuches.  Yeah.  The nuches.  The nudge.  The Daily News is just like, we're going to get a temperature for this grate.  Point.  Yeah, the Daily News measured it yesterday.  We put in new insulation, so now instead of all the hot air coming out in front,  it goes out in the back, said a contractor from a company that did that for Carl Kemp. 
[00:32:00]  Good.  The guy, he did something about it.  He had a problem, and he had a solution.  And if you ask me, I would say this is the final solution to this problem.  I don't think he'll have a problem anymore with this homeless guy.  Final solution.  Done.  Problem solved.  He's just a douche.  Going, I mean.  Let the family take care of this guy. 
[00:32:30]  Have him committed.  Now, the guy left his family 30-some-odd years ago.  Oh, well, look.  You found your dad.  He had some dispute, and he just left his family.  I believe they were in Denver, and just, they all thought he was dead,  and out of nowhere, he shows up here in New York in front of this antique store.  But he's been in New York for a long time.  And there's another guy that allows this homeless guy to sleep outside his joint on the Upper East Side.  Oh, there you go.  So what does he need to get in front of this place?  He gives him a sandwich every once in a while.  There you go. 
[00:33:00]  But he allows the guys, like, you know what, the guy's, he's harmless in the end,  and he allows him to sleep outside his East Side residence.  Give a man a sandwich he eats for one day.  Teach a man to fish for a sandwich, and he'll starve, because that's impossible.  Or poison his sandwich, and he'll never bug you again.  I like that.  Let's go to Paul in Philly, listening to us on WYSP.  Support the local radio stations, will you?  Paul, what's up?  Hey, I agree with you 1,000%, Anthony. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  That guy should not be there.  But does anyone else understand that Carl Kemp is an ass?  Why is he an ass?  You can just tell him he's an ass.  You don't know the man?  He wants to run his place of business without this bum in front of it,  and without the smell of urine in front of his doorway.  Yeah.  He took the bull by the horns, hired a contractor.  You know what it was probably like for that poor guy to part with money?  To have this rerouted out the back?  Well, there you go.  Jesus.  There you go.  Jesus. 
[00:34:00]  You can always take him home, buddy.  And that's got to stink, too.  Hey, you know what?  Paul, I already got homeless people sleeping outside my place, and I let them be.  What's one more?  What's one more?  The smell can't get any worse?  Honestly, I don't have enough room.  I swear to God, there's a homeless guy.  I haven't seen him lately.  He sleeps outside my place of residence.  And you know what?  Every once in a while, it's a drag.  There's something that he has left behind.  Thank God I have a super that takes care of all that.  I wasn't too happy when he relieved himself into the air conditioning unit that pumped into the bedroom. 
[00:34:30]  How great is that?  Oh, man, that's great.  The guy.  So, you know, Paul, I deal with this.  Yeah, I'm sure you do, but I think we should all take Jimmy's suggestion.  When I'm walking out in the morning and Club Soda Kenny is waiting for me in a nice, warm car to make my life really easy,  I look at the guy like, oh, my life could be so much worse.  Move to Florida.  Let this guy be.  Be homeless in Florida, then.  Let this guy be.  Maybe he doesn't have a male prostitute friend like Ratso Rizzo.  He has no way to get to Florida.  The guy is obviously has mental problems. 
[00:35:00]  He now has this family.  Yeah, you left him 30 years ago.  But, I mean, he's got a family that is doing nothing.  All right.  It's their problem.  The guy's a kook.  He's crazy.  He needs mental help.  And no one's giving the homeless guy mental help.  They're giving problems to the guy that wants this mess out from in front of his business.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ernie. 
[00:35:30]  Good for him.  Ernie, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  How you doing?  We're doing all right there, Ernie.  All right.  Look, Jimmy, love you guys.  I'm a new listener since you guys have been on K-Rock, and I absolutely love the show.  Thanks.  Anthony, I totally agree with you.  That was a great way to get rid of the guy without doing anything bad, having him locked up or anything like that.  And, Jimmy, your comment about poisoning the sandwich, absolutely priceless.  That's why we love Jimmy, Ernie.  Sometimes you feel bad to like...  I love you guys.  Punch you now.  I've got to go to work.  Have a great day.  All right.  And I like that you said K-Rock. 
[00:36:00]  I don't really...  No, I do, though, because the station we're on here in New York, it's free FM.  It's free FM in Detroit.  It's free FM.  It's free FM everywhere.  They should have just...  Oh, whatever.  No one's going to...  We're on a few that aren't.  Whatever.  I don't really get the whole free FM thing and how that makes sense.  But that's not my decision.  Yeah.  What were you saying, Jimmy?  I like letters.  I forget, actually.  I had a point...  Oh, damn it.  I just like went away.  Oh.  Something about the guy.  You were feeling for him a little bit.  There was something in you. 
[00:36:30]  I hope not.  No, there was something.  You were going with a butt there.  You don't blame Carl Kemp, but you...  I heard it.  I know.  I'm an adult fish.  There was something in him.  You were going with the butt.  What are you talking about, Opie?  You're like a dog.  You leave for one minute and the dog thinks you've been gone a week.  What is that about?  Jesus.  You'll remember...  You got a memory, will you?  Too many drugs, man, when I was young.  You don't remember?  For that week.  All right. 
[00:37:00]  Then you realize, I can't handle this stuff.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Where's NB?  North Carolina.  I'm in Nebraska.  Nebraska.  There you go.  Do you realize how funny this is hearing you being an advocate for the homeless, Opie,  and Ant taking the other side?  I love it.  I'll tell you why.  I...  He isn't Nebraska?  Isn't it...  N-E is Nebraska, right?  Nebraska isn't N-B?  That's New Balance.  Who wrote that?  That's New Balance.  Oh, Craig. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, may I say...  Oh, you dope.  We don't pay him, though, so let him be.  Yeah.  Okay.  You just keep messing up.  We don't really care.  We'll just get someone else.  It's no big deal.  N-B.  It is N-E, right?  All right.  Brian, what were you saying?  I said, it's just so funny to hear you taking the advocacy side and Ant taking the bad side.  And one other thing, please.  Othar, your balls huge that you're willing to mess with Donald Trump and you're still trying 
[00:38:00]  to find a place to live in Manhattan?  Well, good point.  And I was looking at some Trump places recently, but I guess I'm going to have to move on from  that.  Oh, it doesn't matter with Trump.  As long as it comes to cash and him getting paid, it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  What's said?  The guy's just looking for publicity.  Thank you, Brian.  I got to tell you, yeah, I'm taking the good cop side here, but I just hate rich people.  I hate rich people like Carl Kemp, who can push people around. 
[00:38:30]  I understand the homeless and his plight.  No, he's a douche.  You can just tell he's a douche.  Anyone that would sue a homeless guy for a million dollars is a douche.  It's his gimmick in order to get the ball rolling on us.  Trust me, I'm not the rah-rah, help the homeless guy.  Trust me.  But I could tell, I could just tell Carl Kemp is a douche.  If it was a family or a homeless guy where his family was in the shelter and he's looking  for work.  You know, those fictional homeless people that advocacy groups talk about all the time. 
[00:39:00]  You know, those fictional groups of people like homeless families and stuff.  I've never seen them.  Never seen one.  The only homeless people I've ever seen in New York are stark raving lunatics.  We've had them up in the studio.  They're incoherent drunks.  They babble like idiots.  They go to the bathroom anywhere they please.  And they're crazy.  I understand all that.  You can't run a business with that guy doing stuff in your doorway. 
[00:39:30]  I understand all that.  But the guy could have done so many other things.  He did.  He sued a homeless guy for a million dollars.  After a year of calling the cops and trying to somehow, other ways, get this guy away from  the front of his business, he finally decided, I got to do something.  I don't think the first day he came out and went, there's a homeless guy on my heater.  Great.  Get my lawyer.  You know, well, he is Jewish.  Okay, he might have.  He's a douche, and I think someone should drop a douche in front of that freaking antique  store.  I think the guy did already. 
[00:40:00]  Well, then we probably did.  That's why he called the cops and filed a suit.  We should continue down that road, because you just know the guy's a dick.  Rerouting, so the freaking greatest is ice cold.  He should have piped refrigerated air so it's even colder than outside.  But see, in the summer, they all come back, though, to hang out over that little cool hot spot.  Yeah, I hope so.  God, do I hope so.  People are a little confused.  You know, homeless in general, whatever. 
[00:40:30]  I'm not going to go out of my way to help a homeless guy, obviously.  Go out of my way to step on his cage?  Yeah, of course.  But rich douches like this guy, I caddy for a million of these guys at the Huntington Crescent  Club, so I sort of know what I'm talking about.  I don't know.  Guys that just because they have money, they think they're better than everybody else.  This guy could just be a guy just struggling with a business.  How is he rich all of a sudden?  He's struggling.  He runs an antique store on Madison Avenue in New York City.  The guy's not struggling.  Real estate costs a lot of money over there. 
[00:41:00]  The guy's not struggling.  Probably cost him a lot to rent that place.  He's not struggling.  You're spending the tens of thousands of dollars to rent the place every month or whatever, probably hundreds of thousands, and there's some bum stinking up your  doorway.  Bye.  He's got to go.  The bum has got to go.  I want to talk to the bum on the show.  Let's go find the bum.  Get the bum.  Maybe one of our listeners could help us.  Where does he preach? 
[00:41:30]  He preaches every morning.  He preaches?  He's on Fifth Avenue, I think.  What kind of preach?  Are you going to listen to a guy preaching that is in his own waist?  I've read a lot of this guy.  I guess he holds up a Bible and he's just screaming and preaching to the cars.  One of those.  Oh, I hate this guy.  Let me, uh, can I get one pro call for me?  All right.  Pretty much everyone's beating me up, but let's go to Brian in Connecticut.  Brian, what's up?  Roger on the great. 
[00:42:00]  You're on the, uh.  Hey.  I'm with you on this one.  I mean, these guys got to have somewhere to sleep.  You know?  Do they?  How about a shelter?  How about, how about, uh, a house or an apartment after you get a job and work?  Or how about a mental hospital?  Because you're a kook.  We closed down the, uh.  There are plenty of places.  We closed most of them down.  That's why you got more homeless people and crazies on the streets of New York and every  other city in America.  That's right.  I mean, when we, when we closed down the mental hospital in Connecticut here, all the people 
[00:42:30]  from all those nuts went into, uh, like Norwich and it's, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  It really made the area nice of it, right?  Oh yeah.  It's, it's awesome.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for your support.  Not much coming in today.  Let's say hi to John.  John, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Good.  I work across the street from where this guy got picked up, but I'll tell you the only  reason why this was such a big deal is because exactly what you said, he's on Madison Avenue. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  That's the only reason.  That's the only reason is if he was over on Lexington where the same thing is going on.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be a news story.  And here's the irony for you.  The guy that picked up all these people up the street years ago, Giuliani, lives two  blocks away.  So he had to pass this guy every day too.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  We could go all day on this.  Uh, Doey or Dougie, what's up?  Hey, uh, hey Opie, what's wrong with you, man? 
[00:43:30]  Are you brain dead or something?  I mean, Opie's got this whole thing down pat.  The guy's trying to prove a point.  He's got to conduct his business.  You know, he's not trying to be a douche to the guy.  He just wants to get him off his damn property and the guy refuses to listen.  It's like anything else interfering with your business.  Well, you got it.  You got to remedy the problem.  No one sees, no one sees the problem with suing a homeless guy for a million.  That was like his last recourse.  It was a creative way. 
[00:44:00]  Dude, the guy's life already sucks.  And you're just like, you're just like kicking him in the teeth as hard as you can.  It's a creative way to start the ball rolling to get him out of the way of your business.  That's all.  All right.  That's how I see it.  Well, this story is definitely, uh, it's got some, let's agree to disagree.  I don't give a crap.  You don't like the rich people.  That's the problem.  You don't like the wealthy people.  I truly, this is one of my things I want to get across today.  I hate rich people that think they're better than everybody else because they have money. 
[00:44:30]  And, and, and this smells of that.  I don't know.  It goes back.  When I was a, just a lousy little caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club.  Um, and these guys would treat you like slaves and like crap because they were rich.  If, if this was like the opening sequence of trading places, I would agree with you, but  this guy's running a business.  But in all fairness, they're also, you know, from my experience, I caddy for a lot of guys  that had a lot of money, but they were just the regular guys that just happen to, you 
[00:45:00]  know, have more money than you.  Yeah.  But there was also, there was also those, those people that treated you like crap.  I felt black when I was caddy.  Whoa.  Felt like a Negro.  All right.  Send somebody over to the store later today or whatever, just to get a vibe for the whole  story.  Yeah, talk to him.  See how reasonable that bum is.  Oh, I bet he's just a joy to talk to.  Whoa.  We'll get him on the show. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, please.  We'll try to get him on today.  All right.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to get into the Donald Trump.  He's calling us two slobs in page six today in the New York Post.  Thank you.  We'll get into that next.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wowed.  To get your official Opie and Anthony wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading. 
[00:46:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Make sure you get those wow stickers or the homemade wow signs on the back of your cars  and trucks.  There are women out there.  They see the wow.  Wow stands for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  They will flash you.  This has been happening for, I don't know, about 10 years now, maybe more.  Yeah.  Something like that.  We'll really get into it when it starts getting warm again for most of the cities. 
[00:46:30]  I know it's warm still in West Palm Beach and we went over it earlier.  Dallas, who knows?  It's always a toss up with you guys.  Hey, are we going to have our John and Jeff moment of the morning?  Are we?  Oh, E-Rock is nodding saying yes.  Can't get enough of John and Jeff.  You guys are funny, man.  Also, we've got to talk about the Dakota Fanning movie.  Ah, yes.  Hound Dog.  Hound Dog.  It's called, yeah.  And good old Bill Donahue is all over that. 
[00:47:00]  We should try to get him on the phone today.  Yeah, Bill Donahue wants a federal investigation to see if any child pornography laws were broken  during the filming.  And I think the producer of the movie, someone involved with the movie, maybe even a publicist,  was saying, hey, perhaps, again, they bring out the same thing that everybody brings out  whenever Bill Donahue kicks in with something.  Perhaps you ought to look in your own organization and the Catholic Church for these things instead 
[00:47:30]  of a movie set where the parent is there and everything is done very sensitively on camera.  And so it looks brutal on film when you're watching it in the movie.  I heard this is one of the most disturbing scenes in movie history.  Did you say what it was?  They're billing it as Dakota Fanning being raped in a movie.  And how old is she in the movie?  She's whatever age she is, 12.  All right.  Well, she's 13 now or something.  The weird thing is this movie's a comedy. 
[00:48:00]  How'd they pull that off?  At least he's got a Smokey and the Bandit vibe to it.  What was I going to say?  Last time I was in L.A., I saw Dakota Fanning.  Did you?  Yeah, I was at...  Let me tell you something.  She is adorable.  She's a phony.  What?  She's a phony.  She's in a...  She's 12.  She's a phony.  A phony.  She's a phony.  She's an adult in a 12-year-old's body.  Oh, okay. 
[00:48:30]  Dude.  I was going to say, you are off your rocker today.  She is a phony.  All those interviews you see on TV?  Yeah.  She's acting like the innocent 12-year-old.  This girl is way older than her years.  You think she's in her 20s?  No, I'm sure she's 12 or whatever, but she's way older.  Yeah, she comes off that way in interviews.  She really does.  No, but she comes across like, I'm just a kid.  I'm like a smart, intelligent kid.  No, hear me out.  She's playing the part like, I still get an allowance.  I still have to do chores around my house, and my parents don't treat me any different 
[00:49:00]  than the other kids in the family.  That is all BS, man, because it helps her movie career.  We saw her at Fred Siegel.  She walks up.  First of all, she's dressing like she's 18 or 19 when she's not on these morning shows.  She's got like the Paris Hilton sunglasses on, the big over-the-top sunglasses.  She's got a cell phone and a blackjack and a sidekick and all this crap.  She's big.  She's Hollywood royalty. 
[00:49:30]  She's big.  But as soon as she has to do an interview, this is the point I'm trying to make.  On these TV shows, she dresses down in little girl-like little dresses and stuff.  But when she's out there in Hollywood, man.  She's whoring it up, you're saying.  She's whoring it up.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We saw this all going down.  She was with her handlers, and she had like a long, tight, like black dress on that you  would expect maybe someone like Paris Hilton to wear or anyone else out there in Hollywood. 
[00:50:00]  She's on her cell phone making a call with her big sunglasses on like, I got everyone fooled.  She's a phony.  She's a phony.  Absolutely.  Did you eat today?  Yeah.  You did?  Your blood sugar's okay.  Oh, man.  We're going to rock today.  Trust me.  You're a madman.  She's a phony.  I'm telling you.  Her handlers are telling her how to act on TV as the cute little recent kid that is a  bit smart, a bit intelligent. 
[00:50:30]  I've seen interviews with her.  Yeah, she comes off very, very wise and, you know.  But also cutesy.  Wise above her years.  Like almost surprised.  I don't know.  I don't know how this is happening.  I'm just a regular girl.  Wouldn't that be the way it would work if you had a 12-year-old girl, a 13-year-old girl  kind of that is very smart, that sometimes she would revert back into that kid.  It's like she's riding that fence of I'm very smart. 
[00:51:00]  I've been around.  I know how the business end of this works.  And I'm also a kid.  And so sometimes I kind of slip into that kind of thing.  Well, we saw in L.A.  I just forget it.  I'm done.  I'm not buying into it anymore.  She's ordering like a cappuccino and sitting out there.  She is adorable.  Well, what about a banana split or something for the kid?  She's got to watch her figure.  When she's not on TV, she is walking around like she's 18 already.  I'm telling you. 
[00:51:30]  I saw it with my own eyes.  She's a phony.  Let's wait until she's 18, though, and see what she's in.  Very few of them make the transition.  Foster, Jodie Foster did it.  Very few of them can become.  She's a great little actress, though.  She's really good.  And Dana Plateau wasn't?  Oh, well.  Anyway, so everyone is up in arms.  Well, not everyone's not up in arms.  They're just saying it's very disturbing.  Bill Donahue's up in arms. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  He's going crazy over this whole thing.  And they say it's very disturbing.  Apparently, the gist of this movie is she's a 12-year-old girl who loves Elvis.  It's set back in those days, the Elvis days, I think the 50s, somewhere around there.  And she deals with her hardships through singing Elvis songs and kind of dancing to them.  But she dances around, and they're kind of saying it's a little suggestive, and that  she kind of almost, it can be interpreted that she coaxes this 20-year-old delivery guy 
[00:52:30]  to rape her in the movie.  And it's kind of a brutal scene.  Is it a violent scene, or just like graphic?  It's too graphic for her to actually have acted in it, is what they're saying, because  it's actually her.  And she's doing the part, so I guess there's some uncomfortable moments.  But I'm thinking it's like one of those moments where you sit in the movie theater, and it's 
[00:53:00]  got that, you ever know those movies that had the moment, and you sit there and go,  oh, here it comes.  Okay, here comes the part everyone talks about, you know?  I think that's what this is going to amount to.  Oh, no, the actor wasn't hit the actor's head, because you've got to do something like that.  It's got to be uncomfortable.  She can handle it.  She's 25 years old in a 12-year-old's body.  Well, you don't want to do anything wrong.  Like, if you knew that with an actress.  Well, the other actor was Mark Carr, so I don't think he had much of a problem.  Roman Polanski picture. 
[00:53:30]  First acting role ever.  All I'm saying is, man, I saw a much different Dakota Fanning.  She was hanging out at the same place for, I don't know, 45 minutes.  Yeah.  And I'm like, this is the same girl you see all cutesy on Good Morning America, and I  still do my chores.  Let me just add, she's adorable.  Of course she's adorable, but she's also, you know, not that innocent.  Not that innocent.  She's not, I'm telling you. 
[00:54:00]  She's got us all fooled.  Are you saying this, that perhaps there's a Drew Barrymore thing going on here?  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah.  When Drew Barrymore was growing up, she came off as a very intelligent yet innocent little  girl, and now we find out, you know, later on that she was 10 years old, smoking,  drinking, doing drugs, and living as an adult.  All I'm saying, man, they got an image for her.  Yeah.  Because it's selling movie tickets, and she knows how to play that role perfectly on TV. 
[00:54:30]  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  And when she's walking around Hollywood, she's, you know, she's not playing that same role  that you see on TV.  That's all.  That's all.  She's a star.  She's playing the part.  All right.  Let's say hi to...  It's like dress up.  Let's say hi to Teddy and Historia.  What is Historia?  Who is on the phones today?  Who wrote Historia?  I imagine Teddy's calling from Astoria, right?  Teddy, you calling from Queens? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Historia.  Well, these guys...  You're asterical in there.  It's not Travis, by the way.  I know, because there's something going on.  The abbreviation for Nebraska today was NB, and what was the other thing?  There's been three already today.  Hold on, Teddy.  Hold on.  Someone spelled Astoria H-I-S-T-O-R-I-A, and that would be Craig.  Who's the hash that was sitting in there before you?  They think this kid has something, really. 
[00:55:30]  R-I-A.  All right.  What's up, Teddy, from Historia?  Yeah, I just got flashed by some girl.  You got flashed?  Yeah, I have a wild sticker on my truck.  There you go.  On your truck.  We could take calls like this all day.  Was it nice?  Yeah, they were nice.  Before we continue, could I get a crank water?  What?  Yeah, go ahead.  I figured it out.  I'm the brain.  Yeah.  I was turned to rule, guys.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, again.  And, and, and? 
[00:56:00]  Teddy.  Go ahead, Teddy.  I know.  It's really...  You know what the saddest part is?  It's one guy.  It's the same guy.  Teddy, I don't get...  Teddy.  Oh, and then he hangs up.  He's on right now.  Oh, is he annoying?  If he rules, he's on right now.  Go listen to him.  The most annoying part of his call is when he hangs up, because you just want to confront  him and say, dude, you're one guy.  If it was a barrage of calls or something, it might be different, but my God, you're one  sorry son of a bitch. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  I look forward to his call.  If it was a call like that, it wrecks the whole show.  What do you do?  I'm, and by the way...  I'm flustered.  By the way, had that guy, the second he opened his mouth, I knew it was him.  Right.  Knew it was him.  Knew he was a, a, phony.  A phony, you sfachim.  Curtis from Atlanta.  Opie said she, Dakota Fanning, had a blackjack instead of a blackberry.  You do know there are blackjacks out there, right, Curtis?  Oh, no.  You do know that, right? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, I thought it was her boyfriend, Jack.  I was getting upset.  Or maybe I thought she was in Vegas card playing.  Yeah, sure.  Made a little money.  Someone's saying I'm threatened by a 12-year-old girl.  I don't get that, David, from the Bronx.  Threatened?  What are you talking about?  Because you're player-hating, dude.  What?  You're player-hating.  I'm just making an observation.  That's all.  Don't be a player-hater.  Be a player-participator.  I don't know how the, I don't know how the Negroes say it. 
[00:57:30]  I think it's like that.  All right, let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Don't tell me you guys are going to wolf out from good old Donald Trump.  Oh, my God.  Don't talk about it.  We don't want to get in trouble.  He's calling us two slobs in the paper today.  Of course, we're going to talk about it.  It's not like she's, you know, it's not like it's Whoopi Goldberg or anything walking  into your studio there, guys.  Come on.  We'll have some fun with Donald Trump.  We just need a little more time than two minutes.  We've got like two or three minutes left before we've got to, you know, play a few spots there. 
[00:58:00]  So just hang in there.  Hang in there.  Bring it over to XM later, all right?  I want to hear it.  All right.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, let's say hi to Steve.  Steve brings up a great point.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  It's the only call you were going through.  Oh, okay.  Brings up a great point.  Let's go to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Hey, how's it going?  How's it going, man?  Hey.  What's up, man?  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hey, man.  I just thought it would be kind of, I don't know if anyone else noticed, but it's kind  of weird that Opie was watching Dakota Fanning for 45 minutes in LA. 
[00:58:30]  I was starstruck.  Just like anyone else, I was starstruck.  It's like if she sat there for 45 minutes.  Sipping her cappuccino.  No, he's told what she drank, what she was eating, what she was wearing, who was with  her.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't even realize that.  All her phone accessories.  She's got a dossier on the girl the whole time.  I'm like, why would they leave her alone for one minute?  I only need one minute. 
[00:59:00]  That's funny.  Would you go up and take a picture with her?  There's a little Dakota.  She's very cute.  I love you guys.  Thanks, Steve.  I'm so weird with kids, man.  I would like to because she's very famous and she's a star.  She's a kid.  That's what I might ask you.  I don't think she would mind.  But it's odd to...  It is odd.  I would hate to be blown off by her because I'd have to punch her.  It's just Decker.  Punch a little girl in the face.  Let's go to Ezra.  Ezra. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, Therese.  Hey, man.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Two things.  Actually, I don't know how affected she really is more than any other 12-year-old.  I go to Starbucks all the time and see these girls getting mochaccinos and cappuccinos  and every other woman drink, girly drink.  Young girls that age, by the way, they are.  They're kind of adultifying themselves.  It was in the paper the other day.  Somebody wrote an article about how dressing slutty isn't as bad as people say it is or 
[01:00:00]  have said it is over the years, that it's just part of them kind of feeling out their  adulthood as they come into it.  I'm a DJ.  I'm a DJ.  I do a lot of parties for like 13-year-olds, you know, bar and bar mitzvahs.  Yeah.  You know, and a couple of years ago, I guess it was six, seven years ago, Lindsay Lohan  was at a party I did.  And you know what happened to her.  But she was at the party.  She was just like every other 12, 13-year-old girl.  She was non-affected.  It was right after she made that.  10 years ago?  Right, right.  That was like, what, 10 years ago or something?  Whatever. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  What, is she 19 now?  So it was like six, seven years ago.  All right.  So she wasn't any different.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  By the way, 12 is the new 18.  So there are many people in jail saying that.  Best, Freddie and I are thinking the same.  He said 12 is the new 17.  Yeah, it's still illegal.  12 is the new 18.  There you go.  Trying to keep it legal.  When did we start the countdown clock on the Olsen twins?  Oh, God.  I think we started when they were eight. 
[01:01:00]  Before they had the show.  I'm sure somewhere out there, there's the Dakota countdown clock.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  This is what we got to do.  We all know by now this show has A-D-D.  Okay?  What?  I wasn't paying attention.  So we're going to go to break, and we're not going to get distracted.  And when we get back, we have to talk about Donald Trump and nothing else.  Are we in lockdown? 
[01:01:30]  We have to be in lockdown.  Lockdown.  Put it in lockdown.  Lock the doors.  Lock the doors.  Don't let them call us.  Don't look at pal talk.  We've got to concentrate.  All it takes is, like, we get those moments.  Oh, a butterfly.  Ooh, something shiny out the window.  Right, exactly.  Can we focus for once?  On what?  And get something done.  Donald Trump.  Oh, right.  Tattoo it on your arm.  Let's do a little memento here. 
[01:02:00]  Just tattoo Donald Trump on our arms.  That's what we have to do.  So we remember when we get back that we've got to get into that a little bit, okay?  All right.  Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is calling us two slobs in the paper today.  No surprise, to be completely honest with you.  We knew we made a deal with the devil, so we'll get into that, hopefully.  Talk about the devil when we get back?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Donald Trump.  Oh, Donald Trump was the subject at hand.  Right.  Right.  Let's talk about that.  Oh, boy, look at that.  What happened?  Dream Girls got snubbed for the Oscars. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Did they get nominated for anything?  Not for Best Picture.  Yeah, because the movie got, like, average reviews.  Yeah, they nominated that American Idol girl for Best Supporting Actress.  But what were we talking about?  Eddie Murphy.  I don't know.  After break.  Talk about the Oscars.  No, the three-year-old kid getting kicked off a flight.  Right.  Okay.  Sorry.  For starting a tantrum.  Yeah.  Cool.  It slipped my mind.  We'll talk about that after we take a break.  Wait, what's that?  It's Whip I'm Out Wednesday. 
[01:03:00]  I just got wowed.  I got wowed.  Awesome.  I just got wowed.  Oh, thanks, guys, for Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.

I know you have the ADD, so we want to talk about Dreamgirls. 
[01:04:30]  That was it.  All right.  After the break.  Thank you, Jim.  I greatly appreciate that.  Pass.  Oh, they'll kill us.  It took us a week to get to my baby is black.  Yeah, Donald Trump's in the New York Post today.  Page six.  No surprise, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  He's, I guess, trying to eke out a little publicity for his TV show. 
[01:05:00]  He's trying to keep his name in the papers because, uh...  Yeah, it kind of trailed off with the whole Rosie thing.  That's done, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a dead issue.  And, uh...  You know, he's still got his TV show there, so he wants to get a little more press for that.  So I guess we were the latest, uh...  People to be bashed by him.  Yeah.  What else is this guy calling everybody out?  And then he'll move on to somebody else.  Yeah, then he'll move on to someone else.  The fact is, The Apprentice, you know, it's doing all right in the ratings, but it needs a little help. 
[01:05:30]  It needs a little help.  I heard it was disastrous.  It's, it's, it's doing all right.  They're not happy.  Yeah.  They thought, uh, you know, the ratings would be a little higher.  It doesn't have that buzz that it had, that's for sure.  Like the first season.  I'm not really watching this year.  No.  Actually, I shouldn't say, uh, really.  I haven't watched, uh, one episode yet.  Ooh.  And, uh, we made a deal with, uh, Donald Trump and The Apprentice that we'd have some of the guys that are getting kicked off on our XM show.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, eh, whatever. 
[01:06:00]  Here's the deal with Donald Trump.  Are we slobs just here, or are we slobs at XM too?  Well, he's calling us two slobs.  I got it.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's the interview.  Huh?  Yeah.  The interview with the guy that got booed off his show.  Oh, you think?  Yep.  That's part of it.  I bet you that's part of it.  You think?  Yep.  I'm trying to think what we said.  Was it something stupid?  Well.  From the beginning to end.  Oh, right.  The black gay gentleman.  Yeah.  We had a lot of fun with him over on our XM show. 
[01:06:30]  Ah, what are you going to do?  Got a little crazy.  Got a little saucy.  I don't know.  But, I mean, this is what I could tell you about Donald Trump.  And we knew this going into it.  Donald Trump's a Howard Stern guy.  We all know that, okay?  Yeah.  But he's also not stupid.  Like, Howard's not reaching the audience he used to reach.  This isn't a bash or a slam.  It's just the way it is.  So, don't bother.  This is the reality of the situation.  So, Donald Trump knows that, you know, we're reaching more people than Howard. 
[01:07:00]  So, you know, he's on our show.  Yeah.  That's how it works because they're not that close.  They were close because Howard had a huge audience that Donald Trump wanted to reach.  Yeah.  That's what happens with a lot of the celebrities.  They want to come on the show because they want to reach a big audience and sell their wares.  We have a lot of people that used to be big on Howard's show calling us.  Yeah.  And they want to be on our show.  And we're picking and choosing.  And some were like, yeah, this would make sense for us.  And others were like, nah, sorry, we can't really use you.  Yeah.  You know, so we knew going into it that we were kind of making the deal with the devil.  We really did. 
[01:07:30]  So, the New York Post, page six today, who calls whom is the headline.  And it says, Donald Trump will never be a guest on Opie and Anthony again.  I somehow doubt that.  I'm sure he'll call up if he needs something.  The XM satellite radio duo begged him to come on recently to discuss his feud with Rosie O'Donnell.  That is completely false, Richard Johnson.  That is completely false.  By the way.  Donald Trump's been calling us off and on since we came back to regular radio. 
[01:08:00]  And with The Apprentice, we were one of many people he was calling to drum up some publicity for The Apprentice.  We didn't beg him to come on our show to talk about Rosie O'Donnell.  Dick Johnson from The Post also just can't stand us.  Richard Johnson from The Post, page six, is another Howard Stern guy.  I like using the short version of Richard, though.  Dick.  Dick Johnson, yeah.  He's Dick Johnson to me.  Well, he's saying we begged Donald Trump to come on recently to discuss his feud with Rosie O'Donnell. 
[01:08:30]  That's not really true.  And, you know, I mean, if anything, we would have loved to talk to Donald Trump about the Rosie thing when it was really hot.  It was pretty much almost ice cold by the time he got on our show to talk about it.  Yeah, the guy wanted to keep the thing going.  He wanted to keep that spark lit.  Right.  So he could get some publicity.  Trump agreed with what Richard Johnson just wrote here.  It says Trump agreed. 
[01:09:00]  But after his interview, the shock jock sent out a press release claiming Trump had called into the show,  implying he was hungry for publicity.  That is not true.  No.  Well, I'll tell you exactly what happens.  We'll tear down the third wall here for you.  Uh-oh.  You know, when we have a hot interview or something that might be interesting to the press,  like any other radio show out there, we alert the media.  Hey, Donald Trump is on our show, and this is what he said.  This is what shows do. 
[01:09:30]  It's what every show does.  Not just ours.  It's protocol.  What do you think?  The newspapers listen to everybody's show and watch every show?  That's what happens.  Okay.  Here's what today's program.  Does anything use?  Yeah.  That's what they do.  It is what radio shows do agree.  But after the shock jock sent out a press release claiming Trump had called into the show,  lying he was hungry for publicity.  Forget their show.  Earned down Larry King.  Trolled page six.  The idea that I called the...  Donald Trump, so you're building something called the Empire State Building. 
[01:10:00]  Very interested in this new project.  It's going to be one of the tallest buildings in the world.  Tell me about it.  This new Chrysler building is amazing.  That top is so shiny.  Larry King.  Yeah, well, Donald Trump says...  How about those pyramids?  Everybody in the world was trying to get me on their show.  I turned down Larry King. 
[01:10:30]  Trump told page six, the idea that I called these two slobs is laughable.  Use the slob line for Rosie.  He's running out of insults.  Rosie's a slob.  We can be a lot of things, but we're not slobs.  We're slobs, we're ass, H's, we're that, we can be idiots, we can be jackasses, jerk-offs.  Silly geese.  Silly geese.  We could be stupid sometimes, we can be annoying, arrogant. 
[01:11:00]  But we're not slobs.  We're not slobs.  I take pride in cleanliness and wearing nice clothing.  Same here.  I don't want to be a slob.  I shower every morning.  And he's calling us slobs.  Slobs.  And we're not overweight.  No.  We're not fat guys like Rosie called a slob because she's fat.  So it's inaccurate. 
[01:11:30]  Thank you.  I blame Richard Johnson, to be honest with you.  He's just stirring up some crap.  When I'm talking about Trump, I always call him the Donald.  Donald.  Well, this is what's really...  Donald.  This is what's really interesting as we fight back a little bit here.  This is Donald Trump when he did call our show.  Mm-hmm.  The actual phone call they're referring to here in page six.  He doesn't seem like he thinks we're slobs during the interview. 
[01:12:00]  No.  Hey, we've got to break into this and say hi to a big star.  Donald Trump.  There he is.  Good morning, fellas.  Donald Trump.  How are you?  Very good.  What's new, sir?  Yeah.  Very little.  Very little.  I haven't seen you in the news lately.  You really got to do something to get your name back out there.  It's a very, very low-key week.  It certainly is.  Is it finally calming down?  Well, I hope so.  It would be nice if it would calm down.  I've been trying not to do any interviews.  I've been trying to keep it low-key. 
[01:12:30]  But, you know, when somebody says something like you guys, I respond.  And I guess I respond in somewhat of an inflammatory way.  But people say things and you respond.  We've got to get Donald Trump on the phone.  Let's hash this out.  Yeah.  Let's hash this out.  Why are we slobs?  What did we do?  Yeah, what did we actually do to you?  What did we do?  I'd like to hear it right from him.  Before a full-out attack, I want to know what we actually did to Donald Trump.  To see if maybe Richard Johnson, Dick Johnson, had called him up to instigate things and said, 
[01:13:00]  Hey, O&A said that you were calling up begging for publicity or something.  Right.  He's been a regular caller since coming back to regular radio.  He's been on, I think, three or four times at this point.  We had a give-and-take relationship.  Yeah.  We'd get Donald Trump on the phone.  You know, the guy's a name.  He's a celebrity.  We'd get him on to talk about whatever he wants to talk about.  And in exchange, he would get our listener base to plug to. 
[01:13:30]  So what's the problem?  I bet Richard Johnson's the instigator here.  I think so.  I hope he isn't because I'd just love to tear into Donald Trump.  Yeah, no kidding.  But we've got to get our facts straight.  Yeah, someone get rolling to call Donald Trump.  We'll get to the bottom of this.  Because at the end of the phone call, Donald Trump had this.  And we had a lot of fun last year getting the guys that were getting kicked off on our show.  What's going on with that?  Well, if you want, we can give them to you again. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, we'll be in touch.  Okay, you be in touch with us.  All right, Donald.  Thanks, fellas.  Great show.  Thank you, sir.  So long.  Donald Trump, everyone.  Great show.  That's what he really thinks of us.  But now in the post, he's calling us two slobs.  Great show.  Two slobs.  Let's say hi to Sean in Brooklyn.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Sean?  I think you just played the clip, but I was going to remind you that right at the end  of that clip, Donald said, I really like you guys.  You're a great show.  Hey, every time we've talked to him, we've signed off with, you know, hey, great show. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, I like you guys.  Have fun.  Take care.  Be good.  Be good.  He's been nothing but complimentary.  Yeah.  And then it went from that to slobs in a second.  As you can tell, we're just kind of sitting here trying to figure out what to do because  it doesn't make sense.  It really doesn't make sense.  No.  You know, we didn't tell the media that he was desperate for publicity or hungry for  publicity.  That's ridiculous.  Everyone knows he was on everything.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  You know, everyone was searching him out.  Right.  He was doing a lot of shows.  So can we get Richard Johnson on the phone?  Of course not.  That ain't going to happen.  Of course not.  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone to get to the bottom of this?  Maybe.  We want to know why we're two slobs now.  Richard Johnson.  The idea that I called these two slobs is laughable.  He did call us.  He called us.  He was not laughable.  He called us.  Yeah.  It's not like you were pulled over drunk driving. 
[01:15:30]  That'd make you a slob.  Right.  Well, there's been allegations about Mr. Johnson, but he doesn't write about that in his little  column now, does he?  I don't think it's alleged that he was arrested.  Was he arrested for allegedly drunk driving in the meatpacking district?  Yeah.  That's embarrassing.  That's what I heard.  Take a cab.  You're in Manhattan, you stupid ass.  That's a strange place.  The ways you do things like this.  That's a strange place to be driving around drunk, by the way.  Yeah.  Be sober.  This way at least you know who's who.  Yeah.  You can see the Adam's apple a little clearer if it's not through the bottom of a shot glass 
[01:16:00]  that you're looking at.  It kind of distorts things.  Well, now I'm a slob because I just spilled coffee all over myself.  Ah, you're slob.  So now Donald Trump is 100% right.  Thank you, Than.  So what do you want to do here?  Well, we'll see if we can get in touch with him.  Hammer it out.  All right.  Well, there's, you know, we can play some more of this.  You know what I like?  Someone hits you with a pea shooter, you fire a howitzer back at him.  You have to do it.  That's the only way you stay alive in this game. 
[01:16:30]  When you deal with scum, you have to treat him like scum.  So it's one of those things.  All right.  Now that makes sense.  What?  We're back from the tape.  See?  It went from nowhere to him just firing slob at us because that's his howitzer.  But the reason I brought that up at the time was because that's kind of how we fight.  So if he throws slob at us, oh, boy, believe me, I have a little Rolodex full of things to throw back at him. 
[01:17:00]  S.O.B.  Oh, hey, easy, Jim.  Easy.  Right.  There's plenty of plenty of insults that can be hurled in his direction that that will make Rosie's look stupid.  What started the whole thing was, you know, you gave this girl another shot.  And for some reason, which, by the way, I thought was brilliant, Miss USA, because it usually.  Well, because no one ever gets a second chance.  Rosie would have given her a second chance.  I guarantee you that.  Oh, I'm sure. 
[01:17:30]  Believe me.  In a different sense.  Yeah.  But she would have given her many, many chances, as many as she could.  Oh, man.  We love this guy.  We're having a good time.  If it comes down to it, it comes down to it.  We'll have a lot of fun with Donald Trump.  Oh, if we've got to go to blows, forget about it.  No worries here.  It's over.  You know, it's the honesty, whether people agree with you or not.  But no one is as blatantly honest as you are when it comes to show business.  Everyone keeps their mouth shut. 
[01:18:00]  They try to be polite and nice and not burn any bridges or anything like that.  So that's why people are so captivated by this.  You are coming out and saying things that, you know, a lot of people have thought of.  Well, Rosie, you have to understand, when you deal with scum, you know, Rosie's a liar.  Rosie said, I went bankrupt.  I never went bankrupt.  Rosie said, oh, she talks about my hair.  I'm not allowed to say she looks like a slob, and yet she can talk about my hair.  So some people said, oh, Donald, you've been so personal.  I said, what about her?  Very good. 
[01:18:30]  All right, there's a couple things coming in.  Craig on Long Island.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Here's a question for you.  Donald Trump takes a personal conversation that he has with Barbara Walters and turns it  into a media frenzy with Pumpkinhead.  Right.  Why do you think it's such a stretch that he's going to sell you out and call you two  slobs in the paper?  Oh, we're, you know, we're not stupid.  We know we don't have a friendship with Donald Trump.  He's using us, and we're using him for good radio. 
[01:19:00]  And obviously, he's all about getting publicity for himself, for his pageants, and mostly for  The Apprentice.  That's not doing as well as the TV folks hoped.  Right.  Well, there you go.  But don't be surprised when he sells you down the river.  That's fine.  We'll definitely have some fun with it.  Trust me on that one.  All right.  Later, boys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jay in Jersey.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You guys suck.  Thank you, my friend.  You guys are reading this quote, and you guys are focusing on the fact that he called you 
[01:19:30]  or he didn't call you.  I don't know.  That's how you guys are interpreting it.  When I hear it, it kind of sounds like the fact that Donald called you guys slobs is ridiculous.  Maybe he just said a quote, and Richard Johnson turned it around and wanted to stir up some  trouble.  Yeah, that's why we got to get to the bottom of it.  Well, the quote is, the idea that I called these two slobs is laughable.  Well, maybe he was talking about, you know. 
[01:20:00]  I think it's pretty obvious.  I'm looking at it going, hmm.  That's kind of funny.  You can twist it into the idea that I called these two slobs are laughable, meaning that  him, the act of him calling us slobs is laughable.  Yeah, but the punctuation makes it what it is.  The idea that I call these two slobs is laughable.  You know, he called into our show.  It was, you know, the Rosie thing was still simmering.  We went right for that. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  Because we're a pretty good radio show host.  And he went with it.  He wasn't like, oh, I'm done with this.  And then he said some interesting things.  We sent out a little thing to the media, not a press release.  We sent the audio like, hey, you might be interested in this.  And guess what?  It was printed up in a bunch of places.  Yeah, so it was in the news.  So it helped our show out.  And then we moved on.  But now Richard Johnson is stirring up some crap.  And we want to know what the hell is going on here.  Richard Johnson is an ass.  I think what was brilliant also was during your opening salvo, how you threatened to 
[01:21:00]  take away her girlfriend.  Yeah, no, I think it would be very easy.  Honestly, if I weren't married, I'd have no trouble.  But because of the fact that I'm married, I have many friends that would be capable of  taking her girlfriend away, in my opinion, very quickly.  Let's say hi to Roger in Cleveland.  Roger, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to, I think you just hit on it.  But I want to let you guys know, don't piss this guy off. 
[01:21:30]  He's going to take all your girlfriends from you.  Oh, you got to watch out.  See, my girlfriend has a brain.  It would never, ever, ever happen.  I'm married.  Ever, ever happen.  I'm married, so I can't do it.  This week.  I think my girlfriend would dump me for, I think she'd go with the money, to be honest.  For Donald, yeah.  You're stupid.  Take the cash.  Yeah, please.  Not a chance in hell.  And then she could just come back, like, have sex with you, and bring you some of that Donald money.  Let him deal with her awful caustic remarks. 
[01:22:00]  She'd bring her back over her shoulder and apologize to me and drop her off in my apartment.  Do you hear the things she says?  I'd be like, I know.  I know.  Donald knows how to fight, like, take it down a street level, which is nice.  You see a businessman like you, usually these things are behind closed doors.  They're handled by lawyers.  To see you, a very successful businessman over the years, just take the gloves off, it was refreshing.  And I think that's why it's getting so much coverage.  Well, I think it's right, because everyone wants to be politically correct. 
[01:22:30]  You watch these politicians, and, you know, if they see a girl who's 21 years old, they call her a woman.  And because they would hate like hell to call her a girl, because that would be terrible, and they'll be criticized.  I mean, give me a break.  So, you know, you see all these politically correct people, and you know what?  People are tired of it.  There you go.  There's some audio of us just getting along.  It was a great little...  Yeah, talking, having a fine time, complimenting him on his fighting tactics.  Right.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island. 
[01:23:00]  Greg, what's up?  How you doing?  A new take on the John and Jeff promo.  Yeah.  We have two slobs that have Donald Trump angry at us.  Two slobs.  Okay.  All right, Greg, thank you.  Let's say hi to Kenny in the Bronx.  Kenny.  Hey, fellas.  The Bronx.  Seems like you guys are sort of playing yourselves.  If this was anybody else, you guys are taking it easy on him.  I mean, you guys went crazy on Whoopi, everything like that.  Fire away, man.  I think we're going to, like, kind of just sit on this for a day, because we know what  Richard Johnson's about. 
[01:23:30]  Richard Johnson.  Yeah.  Yeah, the only reason, that's the only reason we're even holding back anything is because  Richard Johnson is such an ass that he would absolutely print something that was inaccurate  about us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Richard Johnson's a big Howard guy.  He's never liked us.  He's taken Howard's side in this whole dumb thing.  And now that he has nothing to write about, as far as that show's concerned.  I think Donald Trump just reacted to, hey, Richard calls him up and goes, hey, you hearing 
[01:24:00]  what's going on here?  They sent out a huge press release saying you were hungry for publicity when you called  their show.  Yeah.  And then Donald reacted, because that's what he does.  He doesn't do any research.  Richard Johnson is a gossip columnist, which, to me, makes him a, he's a wash woman.  An old wash woman.  Every conversation he has, and I've said this before, and I mean it, should be held over  laundry in a yard.  Yeah.  You're abroad.  Over the picket fence with your neighbor that's doing the same thing, hanging her laundry.  While your husband is out working, you should be kvetching with another wash woman, with 
[01:24:30]  a little kid and a little papoose in front of you.  Stupid woman's job you have.  Well, even though Donald said he would never be on our show again, I encourage Donald Trump  to call so we could see what this is all about.  Why is he calling us two slobs today?  Yeah.  In the New York Post on page six.  Why?  Why?  We'll just, we'll just have this sitting here.  Right here.  There it is.  This isn't going anywhere.  Keep it right there. 
[01:25:00]  This ain't going anywhere.  It's in the in-bin still.  It's in the in-bin.  Yeah.  I just like the sound of it cringling.  Oh, yeah.  It's right here.  Look.  Not going to lie to you.  We don't really know what to do with this one yet.  It's right here.  All right.  Get all your Trump stuff together.  We're not hiding.  Call our show and let's talk this over.  Get the ammunition.  All right.  If you've been a phony for the last eight months and you really, really like Howard, but you  had to kiss our ass to get on here to promote stuff, then so be it. 
[01:25:30]  Tell us to our face.  Tell us to our face.  Okay.  Or, you know, every phone call, you say how we're great, like the show, blah, blah, blah.  Is that true or is that crap too?  Yeah.  Because you just want to keep the relationship alive to get ratings up for the apprentice and  everything else you're doing.  So it'll just sit here.  We've never hid before.  Look, Jimmy, it's sitting right here.  It certainly is.  That is loud. 
[01:26:00]  It is.  Sitting right there in a ball.  Sometimes you got to sit on something for a day.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  Because people are expecting us to have an all-out war.  But we know that Richard Johnson is the biggest dick as far as gossip columns go.  Do you think she might have made that up?  Huh?  Do you think she might have made that up?  Oh, she.  Oh, Richard?  Yeah.  Maybe having a belt of scotch.  Maybe playing Pinochle with the ladies.  Nah, belt of scotch.  Behind the wheel. 
[01:26:30]  Driving.  Kvetching.  You know how you work.  How's that charge going?  That thing go to court yet?  Nah, they were able to kind of make that go away.  How can it go away?  Hey, they know how to make things go away.  It was a drunk driving arrest, wasn't it?  They know how to make things go away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Has Richard Johnson ever been to Thailand?  Ever?  Anyone?  Don't know.  It's time to pay a little more attention to Richard Johnson. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  So that's that.  That's what it is right now.  We're just going to kind of keep it there.  Gather our facts.  Yeah, we're going to keep it there for a day.  We got calls into Donald Trump.  We got calls into Richard Johnson at page six.  I know Richard Johnson will blow us off because he hides behind his stupid computer.  His stupid keyboard.  He's one of those guys.  He just hides.  He just hides.  He's he's at the parties, but he's in the dark corner, like lurking.  He's the whole he's the. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my God.  Look what that guy's doing.  And then they can't even write their real names in the paper.  Guess which Hollywood hunk?  You pussy.  Why don't you just say the name?  But he's in the corner with his little cocktail.  Afraid of getting sued.  Afraid of getting sued.  So he's just lurking and hiding in the shadows at the at the at the clubs and stuff.  Just trying to get info on people.  Oh, look what they're doing.  And then what they're doing. 
[01:28:00]  And that doesn't even have the balls to like name names.  Guess which sports star likes to hob the knob a little when he's on the road.  I picture him.  Yeah, with a little tiny dirty pad.  And a pencil that's like an inch and a half long.  All chewed up.  And he just scribbles things.  Oh, look at what he's doing.  Are they canoodling in the corner?  Oh, I think that's canoodling.  Yeah.  Yeah, because canoodling is a safe word.  Yeah.  He's not even brave enough to say that they were just sucking face. 
[01:28:30]  Because they're not.  Usually it's in a loud club.  That they sucked each other's face off each other.  Huh?  Usually it's in a loud club.  And somebody goes up to whisper something in someone's ear.  Or yell in someone's ear.  And it looks like they're nuzzling.  Right.  So, oh, who is canoodling?  All of a sudden it's like, oh!  Canoodles.  So is so is canoodling.  Not canoodling.  But when I write it in page six, I'm going to have to say, guess which?  Richard Johnson. 
[01:29:00]  He's always jotting.  He's a jotting.  He's jotting.  As the pen is just going back and forth.  He probably has one of those stupid micro recorders.  So he doesn't forget.  I've got to remind myself that Jessica Simpson was canoodling with John Mayer.  But I'm not brave enough to say that in the paper because I don't want to be sued.  He licks the pencil point.  It's called a blind item.  They do blind items.  And then you have to sit there and guess. 
[01:29:30]  Try to figure out who the celebrities are.  Oh, real brave, Richard.  Real brave.  You know who he is?  He's the guy from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Just lurking, watching who had golden tickets.  Looking around.  Yeah.  Creep in the corner in the shadows.  That ghoul.  He is a ghoul.  People are asking, was there a press release?  There was no press release.  No.  We got emails of people in the know.  And we send the audio out with a little note.  Hey, you might find this interesting.  Not a press release. 
[01:30:00]  And guess what?  Most of the time, they don't find it interesting.  Like, all right.  Well, we thought it might be interesting.  That's it.  That's how it works.  Throw it out there.  See what sticks.  Richard John.  Someone says he was licking something, but it wasn't a pencil.  Down at the meatpacking district.  Probably salt before he did a shot off his hand.  We'll sit on this one.  Put it aside.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, we got Louis C.K. stopping in for the last hour here.  Nice.  And also, this call.  Sweetie, what?  Mike in Westchester.  Mike.  Yeah, Opie, cut it out already.  You're going on and on about Johnson.  We get it.  Just move on already.  What would you like us to talk about, Mike?  It's now your radio show.  I want the Mike show right now.  Go ahead.  What would you like us to talk about?  Seriously.  I'm giving you a chance.  What would you like us to talk about? 
[01:31:00]  It's just enough already.  You're killing this thing.  Enough.  We're revving up.  Trust me.  Because we've had a problem with Richard Johnson and Page Six for many, many, many, many, many years.  All right.  We do have to take a break.  Louis C.K. is in.  And we're going to talk to Bill Donahue next about the Dakota Fanning movie?  I hope so.  It's been on the news.  This is what's going to happen.  We're going to talk to Bill Donahue.  It might get interesting.  If it does, guess what?  We're going to alert the media.  Alert the media.  Because that's what we do. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whiff-A-Mouth Wednesday.  To get your official Opie and Anthony Wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.

It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, man.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Too much going on, bud. 
[01:32:00]  You guys are having a lot of fun with the Good Morning America segment they're doing right now, huh?  There's some funny stuff going on there.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  What's the product?  I don't know.  It's some kind of mop.  One of those things you put in water and you can mop floors and clean pots and pans.  It uses oxygen to clean the blah, blah, blah.  It's one of those things.  You can't even go into it.  That was during commercials for the Pal Talk people only. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, they enjoy that.  Speaking of Pal Talk, Wow is alive and well on Pal Talk today.  Thank you, ladies.  Yeah.  Just another reason to get Pal Talk.  You get a little extra.  There's a bittersweet thing going on here, though.  It's on the Apollo AC cam.  Thank you for the tribute.  I used to work for Apollo Air Conditioning in New York.  Yeah.  The girl's flashing all morning long.  Very, very nice.  Very nice.  Great.  And then here comes the dude. 
[01:33:00]  And then the camera goes back to Beefcake Guy.  He's got his shirt off and he's sitting there.  Dude, put your goddamn shirt on because the girl is what everyone wants to see.  It's not about you.  It's not about you.  It's, it's, we want to see the girl flashing.  There she goes.  Beautiful.  Very nice.  But then you muck it all up by sitting there without your shirt on.  No one wants to see you without your shirt on. 
[01:33:30]  Very nice.  There she goes again.  And the guy is like, he can't help himself.  He's trying to get back into the frame.  Yeah.  He keeps turning the camera.  He looks like my agent, Pete Pappalardo.  But he has an adorable Siamese kitten.  Just saw that.  All right.  In the chest.  Pete is built like a 13 year old Vietnamese girl in the chest area.  We got Louis C.K. joining the program.  And we got to go right to the phone.  We got Bill Donahue on the line.  We were talking about the Dakota Fanning movie this morning.  I guess it's being shown in Sundance finally. 
[01:34:00]  Hound Dog.  Hound Dog where she gets raped.  Yeah.  Oh.  They say it's one of the most disturbing scenes to watch.  She's 13 now, but she's 12 in the movie.  She gets raped in the movie.  It's a very horrific scene from what they're saying.  Very difficult to watch.  Statutory rape?  No, no.  This is just violent.  You know, no bones about it.  This one is really bad.  But I don't think it's presented or meant to be presented as something pleasant or nice or anything like that. 
[01:34:30]  And I read this morning Bill Donahue, head of the Catholic League, was trying to launch some kind of an investigation into whether any laws were broken.  Any child pornography laws were broken.  And we have Bill on the phone.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bill.  Bill Donahue from the Catholic League.  Hello, sir.  How's everything?  Hello, Bill.  Very good.  We're still working.  How are you?  You're doing great.  Yeah.  Look at us.  You can pick Donald Trump.  That's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  Donald had a – we're still sorting that out to see.  We like getting the facts first before we unload on people, Bill. 
[01:35:00]  I was a little surprised about your move here.  This really doesn't have anything to do with the Catholic religion, and that's usually your forte.  That's usually when you dive in and defend the faith, as it were.  But this movie has got you motivated.  Well, it does.  And also, you're quite right about what you just said.  It's not normally within our orbit.  And also, you're right, and most of the media today are wrong up on the Drudge Report and all over the world, saying that I've called for a boycott of the movie and asked for it to ban. 
[01:35:30]  I never asked for any of that stuff.  I don't know where these reporters get this information.  What I've called for is a federal investigation to see whether the child pornography laws have been broken.  Now, why did I do it, Dan?  I don't want to skirt your question.  We know there's been a problem in the Catholic Church, all right?  Right.  And I'm so sick and tired, if we have a real interest in protecting kids and not just in getting priests, then it shouldn't matter whether it's coming out of Hollywood or a priest, an imam, a schoolteacher, a rabbi, whoever it is. 
[01:36:00]  And I don't like the double standard that we can celebrate, oh, this is cute.  It's artfully done, I'm told.  It's a carefully choreographed child rape scene.  Look, if, in fact, child abuse is wrong, then simulated child sex rape, I think, is also wrong.  So, yeah, when you kind of enter that world of art, though, it's a very tricky situation. 
[01:36:30]  If done properly, if it's part of a story, no matter how horrific it is, and someone wants to depict it on film, why shouldn't that person have that right to depict that art on film?  I think they do have the right.  But that's why I object to what came out in The Guardian today in the U.K., saying I called for the movie to be banned.  I never asked for it to be banned.  Now, look, this is the way liberals think, okay?  They think this is cute, okay?  You can have this.  I don't think anybody, wait, wait, wait, Bill.  I don't think anyone's saying this is cute. 
[01:37:00]  All I've ever read about this whole thing is that it's a horrific thing to watch.  I don't think it's a comedy.  Well, if you read Lou Luminick this morning in the New York Post, he tries to say it's okay.  If you listen to the chicks on the interview yesterday, they tried to say it was okay.  Yeah.  You know what would bother these people, the Rosie O'Donnells of this world?  Let's say the guy who was trying to rape the little 12-year-old was a black guy, and she would use the N-word while she's getting raped.  That would upset liberals, but not the rape scene. 
[01:37:30]  That's the way they think.  All right, well, I do agree with that.  He's kind of making that up, though.  Yeah, that is kind of a long way around that whole thing.  Yeah.  Now, what is the investigation all about?  Because I would assume, now, I don't know, and neither do you, what was going on behind those cameras  and how sensitive people were to this child's needs and protection on the set.  Well, there's no question.  Her mother was there, and, of course, we have the teacher slash child social worker holding her hand. 
[01:38:00]  That's all very nice, but she's 12 years of age.  What happens 30 years from now or 20 years from now?  She's a middle-aged woman, and she has some problems with this.  There have been other women who have been involved in these kind of situations.  They've had problems, too.  But look, my real interest in this was to create a national discussion.  I have no doubt that the people who are defending this would defend a 12-year-old being penetrated two years from now.  Hollywood's going to keep pushing the envelope, and quite frankly,  when you're dealing with kids, it seems to me it should be hands-off. 
[01:38:30]  I've got to disagree, though.  I don't think people would be defending real child sex.  Depicting something in a movie, not because it's sexy art like Mapplethorpe tries to pull off,  but because it's an event that occurs.  It's like depicting a murder.  I mean, no one thinks that a child murder is acceptable, but it is depicted in film.  And I think that the term art, again, not to be confused with quote-unquote erotic art,  which is made to titillate, but this is something that is an actual awful event that happens.  And if it's handled properly behind the scenes, and the kid is protected, 
[01:39:00]  and there's nothing sexual behind the scenes, it's almost like doing a murder.  What's wrong with it if it's done properly in the real world?  Well, you make a persuasive case, but here's my response, fellas.  Because if you have an 18-year-old playing a 14-year-old, okay, I can deal with that.  This girl's five or six years off of a tricycle.  She's 12 years of age, and she's doing it.  You know, there's a lot of sick men in our society who get a lot of strange ideas from the Internet.  I'm not saying that the average guy seeing this movie is going to go out and rape somebody. 
[01:39:30]  Of course he's not.  But somebody who's inclined to be disturbed, he sees this, he says,  hey, not only on the Internet, this is my local neighborhood theater.  I think it says the wrong message.  I think they could have done this movie and gotten that same effect  without exploiting a 12-year-old.  See, you're saying exploited like it is exploitation before you really have all the facts.  And from what you say, there are guys that can grab a catalog for children's clothing  and go off on a tear outside their house in their community. 
[01:40:00]  I don't think they're going to bother spending the $10 to see a fanning movie  so that they can go and then do what happened there.  You know, it's interesting.  You can't even talk about the subject of religion at a public school  because the kids are considered to be, quote, impressionable.  I get that a million times over.  The kids are impressionable at that age.  Well, did she become less impressionable at the age of 12?  I think also you really have to take this as a case-by-case thing  because this girl is definitely kind of very mature beyond her years 
[01:40:30]  as far as an actress and it seems life in general.  She seems very intelligent when you see her.  I think also she got paid very well for that rape.  Got paid very well for it?  For the rape, yes.  Can I mention one other thing, fellas?  At Sundance, they also have this movie Zoo  where it's about a real-life story of a guy from Seattle a couple years ago.  Right.  He decided to have sex with a horse.  Yes, yep.  He's punctured his colon and the guy's dead.  Now, I want to ask, and nobody's talking about it, 
[01:41:00]  so let me bring it up.  It's all I do talk about.  What happened to the horse?  Whatever happened to the horse?  Yeah, I want to know.  Whatever happened to the horse?  He put an ad out on a Craigslist.  Nobody knows that the horse has actually killed a bunch of people with it.  Well, did the horse survive?  And his pedophile lawsuit alleging that his animal rights have been violated?  And because this horse was an Arabian stallion,  I want to know, does this constitute a bias crime?  Oh, God.  Wow.  Look, I like that.  You're having fun with it.  You're having fun with deviant sex.  You still have a good sense of humor.  I think so.  We've learned that about Bill Donahue. 
[01:41:30]  He has a sense of humor.  Apparently so.  I'd like to bring up, by the way,  my name's Louis C.K.,  and I had a show called Lucky Louis,  and you issued a press release saying a lot of negative things about my show.  So I'm on the radio with you.  I can't not mention it.  I remember one thing you said.  You made a list of things that were offensive to Catholics about Lucky Louis,  and one of them was an episode we did where I wanted to help my wife have an orgasm before we had.  We decided not to have another child until we were having good sex and she was having an orgasm. 
[01:42:00]  And you listed that as something that's offensive to Catholics, which I don't understand,  because a married couple trying to make sure that their sex life is healthy before moving on to a second child.  How can you have a problem with that?  Do I have a problem with that?  Wow.  According to your press release, the Reagan defense, I love it.  That's offensive to Catholics.  Bill, is there anybody that ever does the press releases that you might just kind of glance over and go,  all right, and then they kind of, I mean, do you word everything accurately?  Because what Louis is telling you is the truth. 
[01:42:30]  I mean, that really didn't come out.  Yep.  Well, I mean, listen, I write all my own stuff, so I can't blame it on somebody else.  Have you watched Lucky Louis?  No, I haven't.  Well, that's odd because you wrote that thing.  Quite frankly, I don't recall.  I did.  Why don't you send it to me?  All right.  Well, you know.  I'm writing about Arabian horses and buyer's crimes.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, is it probably in your archives on the site because it was up there?  Yeah.  You wrote it, and it was not nice.  When was that?  Liar. 
[01:43:00]  It's over the summer.  You're a liar.  That's when the show came out in June.  Yeah, June or July.  Yeah, we're trying to find the actual thing here, Bill, for you.  Okay.  Google Lucky Louis Catholic.  In the meantime, how is the call for some type of federal investigation going?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I'm not going to bother with these people.  My whole purpose here really is to create a national discussion.  Would the average parent let their 12-year-old be involved in a child rape scene if it was  carefully choreographed? 
[01:43:30]  I don't think so.  I think if their child, they knew that their child was mature enough and an actress and  knew that, you know, this isn't her first role.  I think she can understand the differences between being in a movie and a life event.  You know what I mean?  She may be able to, but how about some of the disturbed men that are going to see this?  Well, we can't base our – see, Bill, that's the biggest problem I have with everything  in life that people complain about.  We cannot base our entertainment and our lifestyle on the fact that a few people might have deviant 
[01:44:00]  behavior based on something they see or play a video game or something else.  Why should the large percent, the majority, have to stop living their life and enjoying  their life because a few people might lose their mind if they see something?  Well, listen, I'm raising moral objections.  Again, I didn't call for a boycott, which I could.  It's a First Amendment right.  I didn't call for it to be banned.  I want to know that the child pornography laws, have they been broken?  And they may happen.  Don't you think there are people on set that really are there to take care of the children 
[01:44:30]  and make sure things don't happen?  There are things, for God's sake, when animals are on the set, they make sure  that the ASPCA is down there.  When children are on set, they have tutors, they have social workers.  All that stuff is taken care of, and there are laws in place to protect the children.  I don't believe you.  I want to know what happened to that horse.  I think the real thing is that he's trolling for stuff that's out, and he goes,  oh, there's a rape of a girl.  I could do something with that.  That sounds good. 
[01:45:00]  What I'm looking at is the hypocrisy in this country, which says that,  whoa, we have priests who molest kids, and that's awful,  but Hollywood can celebrate it, make a buck off it.  Okay, so priests should be allowed to molest kids because Dakota Fanning was depicted being raped in this story.  Oh, I know.  It's simulated.  I think one, yeah, one is a movie.  You know, there's definitely a difference between simulated rape of an actress and the actual rape of a boy in a church.  That's not the way the law reads.  As a matter of fact, there was an amendment to the law just last year,  the Adam Walsh law by Mike Pence out of Indiana, 
[01:45:30]  and simulated sex using a child is, in fact, illegal.  Right, so it's just as bad.  You're right.  Hey, Mr. Donahue, you're not off the hook.  We found the press release about Lucky Louie.  Okay, what does it say?  It says, HBO's Lucky Louie is barbaric.  Catholic League president Bill Donahue commented on last night's episode of the HBO program, Lucky Louie.  Blasphemy often tracks obscenity, and Lucky Louie has been obscene from the first episode, so we were due.  And then you make a bunch of bullet points of things. 
[01:46:00]  Here's a sample of the nine previous episodes, but you said about five minutes ago you've never seen Lucky Louie.  Well, the fact, you know, you don't have to be...  How does that work?  No, no, no, because we have staff here looking at this stuff.  I can't sit around and look at this stuff, but they give me the report.  Now, are those bullets inaccurate?  Why don't you read them?  Yeah, so here's one.  It says, Louie, the main character, is found blanking in the broom closet doing something with himself.  Which, yeah, I know now, and that's again, Catholics don't believe in doing that.  That's kind of cute.  Yeah.  Louie does not want to give his wife, does not want to get his wife pregnant until they figure out a way for her to have consistent orgasms. 
[01:46:30]  So what's wrong with that from a Catholic point of view?  Well, we prefer them to be inconsistent.  Now, look, you've got some of the bullets there that you probably don't even want to read on the air about some of the stuff that's going on there.  No, well, but address this one, because these are your words, and you're making, you're laughing,  but I don't take anything you say about Dakota Fanning seriously, because you don't take this seriously.  Because you couldn't even repeat on the air what I just said there in taking out one of the statements. 
[01:47:00]  We'd like to, but there are FCC regulations in place that are way out of hand.  Now, this is one, it's your words, Louie does not want to get his wife pregnant until they figure out a way for her to have consistent orgasms.  That's something you found objectable, made you call my show barbaric.  So tell me what's barbaric about that.  I'm bringing attention to something which is patently obscene, and if I have a snide remark and you can't get that kind of humor,  I don't know what to do with it.  Now, Bill, I don't understand that.  Yeah, he's trying to, see, Louie wants your reason why that's something the Catholic League would be interested in, 
[01:47:30]  well, would object to.  Why is a guy and a husband and wife having a healthy sex life before they decide to get pregnant?  Why is that a problem?  Well, quite frankly, the media call me here all day long wanting to know, to give a moral, traditionalist view on a particular subject.  And so while my orbit is generally anti-Catholicism, yes, of course, we branch out into other areas when you deal with something that's patently obscene. 
[01:48:00]  Are you just, so you're pretty much just from the school of sex just for procreation?  Well, obviously.  But no, no, no.  The Catholic Church's teachings on that.  Not just for pleasure, so that would be the problem.  We don't defend adultery, is that what you mean?  No, no, it's inside a marriage.  Inside of a marriage, two people having sex.  That's the way it should be.  Making a choice not to get pregnant until they're having a healthy sex.  That's wrong.  That would be in the best interest of everybody in society.  All right, that's what the episode was about. 
[01:48:30]  That's what they were doing.  Yes.  They were married.  I think you're leaving out a few things, a few ellipses here.  No, Bill, actually, I have a question for you, too, because you just said that a lot of times your staff will make points, but then the context is lost.  If you're going to quote something and say it's obscene, you should see it in context, because right here, there's one you put a 16 year old girl offers to perform oral on Louie.  Now, you're correct. That did happen. But in the episode, it was about a rebellious teenager running away.  And Louie not only didn't accept it, he told his wife that he was disturbed by it, and the wife talked to the teenager and worked it out and tried to help the girl go back home. 
[01:49:00]  So the episode was not about being titillating or being dirty. It was about something uncomfortable that happened.  And Louie, the character Louie, goes to his wife and tells her.  And we help reform the kid and send her back home.  And send her home. It's like a Facts of Life episode.  Yeah, it was just like Facts of Life.  Here's the thing is that, like you say, your guys watch this stuff. You don't even watch it.  They prepare a statement, and you say, yeah, that sounds like that's us. 
[01:49:30]  And then you send it out, which to me is...  No, wait, wait, wait. Don't put words in my mouth.  It depends on the show.  Why? The other people did.  Yeah, they put the words in your mouth.  It depends on the show and what's going on.  For example, we take The View every day and we have somebody watch it.  And if Rosie goes off on Catholics again, then obviously I come in and take a look at that little part of it.  Yeah, because that's going to get you more press.  I just think that you're a press hound.  I don't think you really care about the stuff you say, because you wrote this.  How do you know about motive? Now you're getting into motive.  Well, because you didn't watch the show, and you put out this statement calling it barbaric, which is a very strong statement. 
[01:50:00]  Do you guys actually think that anybody who runs an advocacy organization, whether it's GLAAD, ADL, now NAACP,  do you actually think that the CEO, I actually write all the news releases,  do you actually think that Abe Foxman over ADL sits around and watches TV about Jews being bastards?  If they write the press release, then they should watch it.  You guys are living in another world.  Yeah, but you wrote it, so you didn't watch the show, and then you wrote the release, which is dishonest. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, but you haven't found one thing there in that release that's inaccurate.  Yes, but in context, it's dishonest.  If you quote something, and you quote it selectively, it can be dishonest, because you're quoting it out of context.  So in the meaning, if someone says, I'm going to kill you to their friend, and then you say that that was a murder threat,  you're quoting them correctly, but the context you're using it in is dishonest.  Right.  So context does matter, Bill.  Well, that's what the apologist for Dakota founding is saying.  You have to look at the context.  You do, though.  Well, rape can actually look at the context.  But you do. 
[01:51:00]  Everything is in context.  Well, in the last temptation, wait, I'm sorry.  What was the movie with The Christ recently?  Is The Passion of the Christ a movie that advocates violence because there was violence whipping Christ?  Or in the context of the crucifixion, is that violence acceptable to show in a movie?  Well, there's no question about it's acceptable.  It's a historical story.  Right.  So then why is the context there acceptable and not considered a violent or a gratuitously violent film?  We really have to have all this discussion about oral practice.  Sure, if you're going to bring it.  All these girls coming on to the guy, right? 
[01:51:30]  No, no, Bill, Bill.  That's really important.  I'm talking, let's just say.  Of course it is.  Conduct in context.  Girls leaving their homes because they're confused and living in a violent place and then offering oral sex to other men  and finding out that that was a mistake from a responsible adult is important.  And it's relevant.  It's extremely relevant.  And you don't know that because you didn't watch the show and yet you wrote this.  I don't know what it was.  Look, have you seen Dakota Fadding yet?  No, but that's why I wouldn't comment on it.  I wouldn't have my organization if I had one say anything about it until I saw it. 
[01:52:00]  Isn't that interesting?  It was about a year ago, the media kept telling us, you don't have to see the depictions of Muhammad because we've made up your minds for you.  We think it's offensive.  But because of me...  It's got nothing to do with what we're talking about.  I agree with that.  Let me give you one example.  Just imagine this.  A white guy is performing oral sex on a statue of Martin Luther King with an erection.  Now, do you have to actually see it in order to find out that it's ugly?  Well, depending on the context, that could be very interesting.  Of course the context.  The context of that, by the way, is your bizarre imagination. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, Bill, come on.  You're going to make that up.  Yeah, you sicko.  I love the guys who say, what if some guy performed oral...  How would you like that?  I don't know.  What's your problem that you're even picturing that?  Why don't you explain to African Americans what the context is?  I'll give you a context.  It never happened to you.  I would absolutely give you a context of how that would go over.  If it was on an episode of the Dave Chappelle show when that was on, in some type of comedy sketch, 
[01:53:00]  it would be completely accepted by the black community.  Oh, I don't think so.  I do.  Well, I don't care.  No, no, there would be certain people that would be outraged, but the majority would find it hysterical.  Dave Chappelle put out a lot of material that would have been racist if it was the other way around.  I beg to differ.  I think you're totally wrong on that.  Blacks would be outraged and rightfully...  But you made up the whole thing.  You made it up, Bill.  I know, but you're making a case on something you made up. 
[01:53:30]  You keep dancing around this whole question of context.  We're not dancing around.  We're talking about things that actually have context,  and you're dancing around them by creating false things that don't have context in reality.  That's an analogy.  What's that?  I have to give you an analogy.  No, you don't have to.  You can actually talk about the thing we're talking about.  The first time we raised this just to get your reaction on your own words,  your only reaction was, well, I don't know, because I didn't see it.  Somebody else watched it and told me what was on it, and then I poked this up.  Yeah, but you just raced it with a bullet, it seems to me.  That was sufficient. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, but HBO's lucky is barbaric.  All they're saying is they think you should at least watch the thing.  I don't want to take over your show with this, but I think this guy is full of baloney.  Louie, he knocked your show, and you had every right to talk to him about her show.  We watched what you liked, Louie, and you got a very interesting picture on life, I'll tell you that.  But no, the context discussion does matter, Bill, because to bash something is barbaric.  When you took the complete opposite intention of the show, which was a positive thing about a family. 
[01:54:30]  Well, because you didn't watch it.  That's what's wrong with being the president of an organization  and saying a very strong and out-of-context statement about it without having seen the show yourself.  It's irresponsible.  That's kind of disturbing that you haven't seen the show.  And then you write this thing about it.  It's nice to know that Lucky Louie likes the child rape movie.  That's what I like.  Oh, see, you're just good.  That's the next statement.  You're an idiot.  That's the next statement in the press release.  Lucky Louie likes child rape.  You're unable to discuss it. 
[01:55:00]  You can't defend your own words.  You're full of it.  Fanny Flick balk worse than bite.  Yes, there's a rape scene, and it goes on about.  There's no nudity.  Just seeing her underwear and whatnot.  So what?  You didn't see it?  No, you didn't see it.  You don't watch the stuff you comment about.  What a stretch.  You're totally uncredible.  You're not interesting.  You know, quite frankly, every movie that comes down the pike that slams the Catholic Church,  you like.  There's no question about it.  No, that's not true.  No, that's not true.  And you also like that.  You don't know what I like. 
[01:55:30]  Well, I certainly do.  I know you like this movie.  He likes men, Bill.  No, you don't.  I didn't see the movie, you blockhead.  I didn't see it.  I'm not even interested in it.  I'm not even talking about it.  I'm talking about my show that you slammed and are unwilling to stand behind your slams  because they came from not even watching the show.  They came from being president of the Catholic League and wanting it.  Attention.  You just want attention.  Well, I'll tell you, you certainly gave it to me, didn't you?  Yeah, I did, because you pooed on my show, you dink. 
[01:56:00]  All right, Bill.  Also, by the way, Catholics are wrong about God.  Let me just throw that in.  Hey, it's the only true religion, my friend.  You burn in hell.  I'm not.  I'm going to have a ball there.  All right.  All right, Bill.  Thanks for coming on the show, and we'll keep tabs on the news and see what pops up about  this whole thing.  I'll have to try to keep it in context.  Keep it in context, Bill.  Go find that horse.  Learn something.  Good.  All right. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe go see the movie.  Take it easy.  All right.  There he goes.  Bill Donahue from the Catholic League.  Wow.  F-ing O.  Wow.  Louis just completely called him out on that, and there really wasn't an answer.  See, the thing is, I would have been totally happy to debate him about it, because, look,  every one of these points, from a religious standpoint, he might have a point on it.  I was really interested in hearing it.  And if your name is on it, you had better be familiar with it.  Totally interested in hearing it.  If he had said, yeah, no, you shouldn't be giving your wife an orgasm, I'd like to hear the  Catholic point of view on that. 
[01:57:00]  That's interesting.  But he didn't.  He just said, I don't watch stuff that I write about.  The one subject matter of the show that Jimmy pointed out was a perfect example of context.  How, when it's written like that, it sounds like this is a gratuitous scene with a young  girl, impressionable, and sexual activity with an older man.  And meanwhile, the whole thing was about you getting upset by the whole situation and taking 
[01:57:30]  care of it, but taken out of context.  And then when he came up with the context of his imagination, it just blew the whole thing  apart.  He's got a great imagination, though.  Wow, huh?  Where did that come from?  How great is it that he goes, I never saw the show, I don't remember writing that.  And we got it right here in front of us.  Yes, exactly.  I mean...  No, that's what these guys do, though.  If you give them something that's in reality that they shouldn't have said, they come back  with something that doesn't exist and say, what about this? 
[01:58:00]  I want to know how you get a statue of Martin Luther King in that state.  Yeah.  In the state of arousal.  And then he decides what other people would have thought of it.  Yeah.  Right.  That's his only way to argue back.  Yeah, well, I bet if I killed your mother, you would get all weird.  And you...  Well, I guess I would.  I'm not sure.  We're in the right context.  Also, go ahead, Jimmy, go.  And these hilarious Lucky Louie episodes on DVD the 30th.  That's right.  Nice plug.  The 30th of January. 
[01:58:30]  That's right.  Next week.  Next, what, Tuesday?  Let's sign a copy and send it to Bill Donahue.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  He probably would enjoy watching.  Also, let's not forget that the great Louis C.K. called Bill Donahue from the Catholic  League a blockhead.  A blockhead.  He was stumbling over curse words.  And he goes, you...  Well, blockhead.  Because he wanted to make sure people heard that he, you know, called him a name.  So he's, like, searching for something that would make sense on regular radio.  Nice little rascal's insult. 
[01:59:00]  You...  Can't wait to get over to XM.  You blockhead.  You dink.  Can we please call him from XM so I can try again?  Just unload.  It was painful.  It was like he moved the football when you were trying to kick it.  But we've got to take a break.  All right.  We'll do that.  Louis C.K., yes.  Lucky Louis on DVD this coming Tuesday.  Is it Tuesday already?  Wow.  Yeah, this coming Tuesday.  Very exciting.  Already for pre-sale on Amazon.  You can already go try it.  Oh, go to Amazon and then...  Watch it and burn in hell.  And do some pre-sale.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:59:30]  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I've got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME-05.  That's 866-WOWME-05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Louis C.K. in studio on the Opie and Anthony show.  That was a lot of fun to listen to.  You guys with Bill Donahue from the Catholic League.  Don't forget, Lucky Louie on DVD this coming Tuesday.  And I got to mention yesterday, next time we had Ricky Gervais do a great hour with us.  We forgot to mention his website, RickyGervais.com, from the office, the British version of the office.  And, you know, we had a wonderful time.  Man, was he a blast.  He sure was.  He was hysterical. 
[02:00:30]  And somebody, who is it?  No Filter Paul, sent me a website that featured his band from 1983.  And he looks like David Bowie with black hair.  Yeah.  You look at him now.  And, you know, this guy from the office.  Yeah.  And he looks like a girl.  He's, like, very feminine looking.  He's pretty.  That's what my girlfriend said.  You'd have to call him pretty.  I go, guess who this is? 
[02:01:00]  And she couldn't.  And I go, that's Ricky Gervais.  And she was, like, oh, my God, he's beautiful.  All right.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Tom.  I hope Bill Donahue's staff down there at the Catholic League has a good claw hammer to detach his sack from the wall.  You nailed him, Louie.  Nicely done.  Oh, yeah.  Watch it out, boys.  Poor Bill.  Yeah, he was blindsided.  It just came together.  We were going to have Bill Donahue on the show today. 
[02:01:30]  Lucky Louie was stopping in as well.  I had no.  Louie C.K. was stopping in.  I had no idea that he wrote all that stuff about you.  So it worked out perfect.  I love when that happened.  You heard his name, and I was like, oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice opportunity.  I remember, too, before you even, because Louie held up a sign and said, this guy trashed our show.  And I remember before you even said that, I was like, boy, I think I remember him coming into conversation not liking Lucky Louie.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, and like I was saying, if he had responded to the things he said and backed them up, I would have had a civil conversation with him. 
[02:02:00]  I wanted to find out why he said them and debate it, because he has a right to those feelings.  I was raised Catholic.  I mean, it's a religion.  But he's just, oh, I didn't watch it.  Somebody watched it for me.  There's a staff.  And by the way, what if somebody had oral sex with a Martin Luther King statue?  Where did that come from?  And if Dakota Fanning can get raped, then we should be able to have sex with boys.  It was a wild and woolly conversation. 
[02:02:30]  He must have had a hell of a youth with that imagination.  Alone at night in his bed.  I know.  Here's what the problem is.  He's got some great scenarios.  He has a sense of humor.  You can tell to some point.  But when other people like staffers are writing stuff and he's signing off on it, he wields a lot of power.  The guy is the guy, believe me, that got us fired.  It was the Catholic League's input to Infinity Broadcasting that got us thrown off the air. 
[02:03:00]  Regardless of if you agree that we should have been thrown off the air or not, I don't even want to get into that.  But he's the guy that did it, though.  He wields too much power to, just on a signature, be able to have people condemned.  Well, and the thing about the Catholics is that my grandmother is Catholic and anything that she's told to believe that has Catholic written on it, she goes, oh, okay.  Because they're very devout people and they're very loyal to their faith. 
[02:03:30]  They don't question anything.  So if you put something out, they're going to believe it.  So, yeah, that makes them very proud.  You know, I knew this family growing up that was strict Catholic, ridiculous Catholic, where they would – the mother would read the newspaper, the Catholic newspaper, when we wanted to go out to the movies.  They had like a bevy of beautiful daughters in this house.  So us as young guys were like in our teens.  We used to just pile over that house and try to take the daughters out.  So we'd go to the movies with them.  And she would look through the Catholic Digest and check the rating for the movie. 
[02:04:00]  And some of them were condemned.  It was like this movie condemned.  This movie is excommunicates.  Yeah, we would have to pick a movie that was acceptable from that.  Meanwhile, we never went to the movies.  No.  We would go and have just ridiculous sex in parks and schoolyards.  And it didn't matter as long as the movie we said we were going to.  I don't want you pretending to see this movie while you're having oral support with my daughter. 
[02:04:30]  That's exactly it.  That's so Catholic.  That's so beautifully Catholic.  It's typical.  And, of course, she knows that you're doing that.  Exactly.  She just doesn't want it done while pretending to see the wrong.  I'm pretending that you're going to this movie.  As long as the story lines up, you're seeing a nice movie that I won't even think about.  And they used to go, hey, take our car because they had the station wagon.  I can't tell you how many of me, my friends, my brother, all the sisters just in this car, their own car. 
[02:05:00]  It was like that 70s show type station wagon.  With the paneling.  Just unbelievable.  Hey, Fred's in the background here from Brooklyn.  Yeah, Fred, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I adore you guys, man.  Hey, Louis.  Beautiful pie in the face, man.  What hypocrisy and what power he's been wielding for so long.  With such limited information.  Yeah.  How many people has he probably destroyed careers and never even seen or heard what they put out? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Just hypocrisy, man.  Beautiful timing.  Incredible.  And you've got to love that he called him a blockhead.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  My favorite insult of the day.  He was searching, searching, searching, and he came up with blockhead.  Why you blockhead?  I ought to make us.  Glad you didn't threaten to give him a knuckle sandwich, Louis.  Up your nose with a rubber hose.  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Unfortunately, we could so do another hour, but we've got to get out of here and get over  to Exxam.  Got to go over to Potty Mouth Central.  Two more hours.  No blockhead over there.  Remind us about John and Jeff.  These guys are great.  Yes.  And how the station here in New York has decided to take our words and make it look like we're  endorsing that program now.  Twist them around.  Oh, we'll get into that tomorrow.  Yeah.  Also, oh, the kid that got kicked off the flight, the three-year-old. 
[02:06:30]  That would have been a good one.  Bravo to the flight crew.  I think we'll just go and do that over at Exxam.  That's what we do.  Hey, if you're not joining us over there, have yourself a great day, all right?  Oh, Louis C.K., Lucky Louis, on DVD this coming Tuesday.  You can buy it now on Amazon.  Yeah, pre-order it, man.  Very cool.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  I love showing my introverted fat guys to whip them out Wednesday. 
[02:07:00]  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:07:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:09:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:09:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:10:30]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd. 
[02:11:00]  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  O.B.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:11:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  We got to change the intro.  No, we don't.  That model thing.  I know.  I don't want to hear that line anymore.  I remember when you said it and it just like, I don't know why, the beauty of it just hit me one day.  I was thinking of it.  It was just so fucking obnoxious.  It's perfect.  Do you know I could have been a model?  Yeah.  That has to stay.  That should be the whole intro.  Just that line over and over again. 
[02:12:00]  Louis C.K. has joined us here over at XM.  Lucky Louis on DVD this coming Tuesday.  That's right.  In the intro to this version of the show.  Yeah.  It's Opie, Anthony, Jim.  And then there's a little snippet from the show.  And someone was getting under my skin so bad one day.  The best I could come up with was to scream as loud as I can with passion.  Do you know I could have been a model?  Yeah.  Did you mean it?  Was it a real feeling?  It couldn't have been anything but.  Yeah.  Despicable. 
[02:12:30]  And now we're finally breaking it down.  It's been part of the intro for a long time.  It's like, I'm such a douche.  It's like, I'm basically telling everyone how lucky they are to have me.  It's awesome.  The modeling world was calling and I decided, no, I need to be a shock jock.  You're a lucky bastard.  I might not be here to entertain you.  Right.  It just struck me as funny one day.  I'm like.  Oh, it's awful.  It was just such a moment of like, just something that had to be said finally being said.  Sure.  Yeah.  Well.  Hey, the dump report is very, very funny today. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Let's get a little looksy at that.  Looks like old Bill Donahue's a potty mouth.  Potty mouth.  He got some dumps.  It's fun when you could read the dumps of the president of the Catholic League.  8.17 a.m.  A child being penetrated.  Yeah.  Bill Donahue from the Catholic League.  Had to talk about that one with Tom on the way down.  And I was saying that would have been great to leave that because could you imagine if we 
[02:13:30]  got an FCC complaint based on that?  Right.  Yeah.  And it would have been him.  Yeah.  The press, we would have had to say, yeah, we got a complaint.  The FCC wants to fine us $320,000 because of something that the Catholic League president  said on our show.  How great would that be?  And he was talking about penetrating a child.  Because then you would have gotten to put out a press release that says, we ourselves were  shocked.  Shocked by the language.  Disgusting man.  We'll never have him on again. 
[02:14:00]  As we were adhering to FCC regulations, the Catholic League president blurted out, we  do not condone the words of this disgusting individual.  Our fault was-  I think he should step down immediately.  Our fault was assuming that he'd behave.  Yeah.  We thought we'd give the dumb guy a break.  Like that's a-  What could possibly happen with the president of the Catholic League?  The Catholic League.  Oh, yeah.  Who's going to complain?  Oh, my God.  8.13 a.m.  A guy performs oral sex on a Martin Luther King statue with an erection.  Holy shit.  Bill Donahue again. 
[02:14:30]  I don't know where.  What the fuck was he thinking about?  And by the way, a brilliant example by Anthony.  Because I was trying to think where would that be acceptable.  And Donahue was wrong in that on Chappelle's show, under what context, say Chappelle was  doing a funny sketch about how white people always want to know what they can do to make  black people happy for the way they treated us.  Here's a start.  Black people would not be enraged about that.  A few might be, but the majority would laugh.  Like, what movie was that, Barbershop?  Some people got upset at the-  Rose of the Park.  They were talking about Rose of the Park, trashing her in the barbershop. 
[02:15:00]  And it was only a few black people that got upset with it.  But by the most part, they were loving it because they were paying money in droves going to see  the movie.  That's right.  No, I was working with Cedric when that movie was made.  He's the one that said the remarks.  And most people, that's what black people are, a lot of black people are tired of being  told that they revere these figures.  Right.  And a lot of them are like, oh, those old fucking niggers, I'm tired of them.  So, yeah. 
[02:15:30]  The thing is that Jesse Jackson doesn't speak for even, I don't even think that many black  people.  Yeah.  So, whatever.  But it's just funny that that's what, he has nothing on his side.  So, he goes, whoa, what about that thing I just made up of somebody blowing Martin Luther  King?  Like, what's swimming around his head?  How do you feel about that?  I got to jump in really fast because Joey from Howard Beach has a great idea.  Okay.  Guys, you should put out a press release with all of Bill Donahue's quotes taken out of  context.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, right?  We didn't actually hear the show.  Right.  But what he said was this.  And here is the audio.  Martin Luther King.  Well, I think blacks ought to be outraged by his depiction of Martin Luther King.  And here's the funny thing about, like, wow, did my thought just go away.  Dude, you're a goldfish.  Oh, my God.  No, I had a thought.  I was thinking about his idea and, like, I'm enjoying his idea about the press release. 
[02:16:30]  You know what?  Wow.  Even if you weren't on the radio, that would have been retarded.  It's okay because you're in love.  Yeah.  I know what happens when you're in love.  I love that you were looking at me, though, because I saw the whole process.  I saw Jimmy go, yeah.  And then there was that silence, and then he just kind of looked at me like, oh, my God.  I have no recollection.  His eyes went blank.  It was like watching a guy die in a movie with his eyes open.  The Terminator.  You're a terminated fucker.  And my eyes just went black.  I wanted to come over and slowly shut his eyelids. 
[02:17:00]  Yes.  Oh, so sad.  Hey, we got to get this in, Chris.  Come on.  It's the truth.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to call and kiss Louis C.K.'s ass.  The HBO special was amazing.  And the comment about sitting on Jeff's ass while he masturbated.  Oh, my God.  Thanks, man.  Okay, bye.  Thanks a lot.  I was just telling Louis, I watched it twice.  I watched it when it first came on, and then I'm going through the channels, and you're about 
[02:17:30]  ten minutes in, and I just stopped and watched it again.  Oh, thanks, man.  It's so fucking funny.  You take on stuff.  It's not like, you know, you could see a few comics, and they might touch on some of the  same stuff, or this, that.  So original.  So fucking funny.  Oh, thanks, man.  That time machine shit, I almost fucking pissed myself.  Thanks, man.  Because no one, like, everyone thinks of that stuff, but you gave it such a great, unique 
[02:18:00]  twist.  Oh, thanks, man.  Like, this dopey conversations.  You know, what would you do if you had a time machine?  Yep.  And then you always got to chime in.  Yeah.  And it's always the other guy that wants to say what he'd do with it, so he's got to present  it in the form of a question.  Yeah.  It's so fucking good, man.  Such a great take on it.  Go back 30 minutes and punch you in the face.  Thanks.  You've got a different look, which is very refreshing.  Yeah.  Louis is a great clarifier of points.  Like, this is what, I get lost in an emotion of something. 
[02:18:30]  You get lost in trying to remember a line you just had in your head.  You don't even know where you are.  But he's a great clarifier of points.  Like, yes, that's exactly, if I was not a dumb motherfucker, that's what I was trying  to say.  Let's go to DC.  What's up with DC today, Nico?  What's going on, guys?  Love the show.  Listen every day.  Hey, I'd like to comment on Louis C.K. calling Bill Donahue not only a blockhead, but you  missed the best quote. 
[02:19:00]  You called him a fucking dink.  I did hear that, a dink.  I called him a dink, yes.  Yeah.  I grew up with that being a bad thing to call somebody.  Yeah, it's not just like some kind of Asian thing.  You dink.  No, it's like calling somebody a dick.  Yeah, it's a dick dork.  He is a dink.  That kind of thing.  He's also a faggot cunt.  Now that we're over here.  XM.  Love it.  God bless XM.  Rocky on Long Island.  Fucking no.  Hey.  Lou.  I like the fact that Opie has a problem with the intro, where he says he's a model, but 
[02:19:30]  Anthony has no problem with the fact that he says I'm gay.  Yeah, I kind of yell out, I'm gay.  I don't know where that came from.  I don't know.  Your subconscious?  Yeah, perhaps.  Well, someone reminded me why I said, you know, I could have been a model.  There was some just twat saying how ugly we are and how she's seen our pictures and this  and that.  Oh.  And then you blurted out, I could have been a model.  You don't know how wrong you are, Misty.  Listen, lady.  Look at me, Charlie.  There's a surprise for you. 
[02:20:00]  I am so not ugly.  It still sounds douchey.  I could have been a model.  It sounds worse because you're saying not only am I not ugly, but I'm beautiful enough  that I could have made a living on it.  I could have been a model.  Look, man, I know it.  I'm insane.  That's awesome.  I know it.  We do blurt out things or things, again, the context, taken out of context.  They have clips of us saying stuff, you know.  Horrific things.  Oh, and then that cock in my mouth.  Yeah.  Now they have that.  That's right. 
[02:20:30]  See?  But out of context, you know, I think if God met Bill Donahue, he'd shit right in his  mouth.  In or out of context.  Yeah.  Fucking piece of shit.  It just makes me mad because of my stupid Mexican and Catholic grandmother who listens  to dorks like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too much power, man.  Yeah.  Too much power.  We were laughing on the walkover because Jimmy was talking about kind of, you weren't  defending Donahue.  No.  But you were kind of saying that it's, I don't know, you didn't give him enough 
[02:21:00]  credit for having as much power as he has.  Well, he was saying he's a funny guy and he's a guy who will reverse himself.  Right.  He'll reverse himself.  That's what you said.  He'll reverse himself.  And I said that's all well and fine, but he wields too much power.  He destroys lives and livelihoods.  And I brought up the point that Hitler would probably have been a pisser in a bar as the  painter.  You know, you get a few drinks in this guy and he'll go off on the Jews. 
[02:21:30]  That's what you were saying because that's what Hitler was.  He was a beer hall nut.  And people would get him drunk and he'd stand up there and say, that's Jews.  And they would all bang their mugs.  This guy's fucking great.  Listen to him.  And then some guy that used to watch him at beer halls reads the paper.  What the fuck?  He's chancellor?  What are you nuts?  He was funny.  It was funny.  He said, kill the Jews.  It was awesome.  We'd laugh our asses off, finish our beers.  Oh, now this guy's running the show.  Are you crazy?  Yeah.  And that's kind of the Bill Donahue thing is like, it's fine when he's making jokes 
[02:22:00]  about horses fucking guys up the ass and killing them.  Fine.  But then when he's putting out press releases, getting people, yeah.  No, no, no.  The Davian Goliath fucking logo at the end of the show on there.  Yeah.  No, I agree with you.  You're right.  But I'm saying, like, if you look at whether it's Muslims or Jews, any religious guy like  that is awful and pious.  Yeah.  At least with him.  Anyone else running the Catholic League, you're going to get a guy who is religious and self-right.  You can't avoid that.  Duff shirt. 
[02:22:30]  But at least with him, you do have the other angle where he will come back and go, all  right, look, I didn't see it.  You know what, though?  If he had argued about the points, I would have had no, as a matter of fact, I prefer  a guy who has those beliefs and puts out a statement and says, this is what our religion's  position is on this, to a guy, I mean, imagine a Muslim guy, like the guy who said, whatever,  somebody makes a fatwa on the Danish cartoonist, and you call him up and he goes, oh, I didn't  see the cartoon, I just, I don't really look at these things, I just signed off on his 
[02:23:00]  death warrant.  Yes, that's all, it just was a, you know, I don't think Bill Donahue reads, looks at  his things.  By the way, what if someone sucked off George Bush in an Easter parade, how would you like  that?  You would have his head cut off, wouldn't you?  Yeah, I bet you guys would, you hypocrites.  God damn, that is fucking funny.  And Martin Luther King had an erection, too.  Yeah, just an amazing imagination from that guy.  It came out of his head, he didn't even have to think about that one. 
[02:23:30]  He didn't have to go, okay, let me come up with a horrific little scenario for you.  Give me a minute, I gotta think, it was just, let's say Martin Luther King's being sucked  off by a white guy, what the fuck?  Jesus, you sure can't come up with him, Bill.  What a show today.  Brian.  Oh, Bill.  Oh, we haven't asked this question in a while.  Brian's, hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Brian's a trucker.  Brian, what are you hauling today?  I'm hauling insulation.  Insulation. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  Gotta watch that shit, Mixich.  Yeah, I don't have to unload it, I don't give a shit.  Good.  But I wanted to tell Louie, I love this comedy special, and yesterday me and my wife were  having an argument, and it completely changed when she told me to suck a bag of dick.  We both just started laughing, and that was the end of it.  Oh, I'm glad I was able to help there.  You're gonna get the DVD on Tuesday.  What's that?  You're gonna get the DVD on Tuesday.  I certainly am. 
[02:24:30]  It's already on pre-order.  All right, right on.  Thanks, man.  That would have been a better story if he said, she told me to suck a bag of dicks and  I knocked her teeth out.  Probably did.  He just left that out.  Yeah.  But then he still laughed.  Yeah.  I knocked her teeth out, then we laughed.  Let's go to Florida.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, uh, Anthony, you got that, I'm gay, from your friend out in California, when you  were describing him, when you went back, and he was like, I'm gay.  Gay Richard? 
[02:25:00]  No, it's not Richard.  Trust me.  No, no, I know.  So I blurted that out.  I know it's not Richard.  Richard has been dead a few years.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Go ahead, man.  Jimmy.  It's not going to work.  Yes, bud.  Yuck.  What?  That's all I got to say.  What?  In love, little fool.  I am in love.  Oh, in love, little fool.  You're just a fool in love.  Well, I can't help it.  I mean, we get along very well, and last night that she was over, I did a lot of this.  I'm glad you're my girlfriend. 
[02:25:30]  You know what they do at the airport that is just nauseating and hysterical?  At the same time.  They'll walk down the center's concourse while we're walking to the terminal, and just, like,  look at each other, turn, and go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, just start laughing at each other.  Like the obnoxious couple.  Obnoxious couple laugh.  Yeah.  And they're doing it, obviously, on purpose. 
[02:26:00]  They're not discussing anything.  They're just walking down laughing, and people are looking at despising them.  Just shut up.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I know.  Like I was saying, though, when it's a good-looking couple doing that, you just hate them.  But they're half a good-looking couple.  I mean, because she's really cute and nice.  And Jim is so lucky.  It just makes me happy.  Because you have friends, look, Jim is a, I think he's a handsome guy, but most people 
[02:26:30]  don't.  I mean, by America's standards, which I don't think are right, he's not doing so good.  But he's got a great, he's the kind of friend you worry that he's going to die alone someday.  You know, like when you have a friend, you're like, please, somebody fucking pick up this  girl.  Please.  Yeah, please.  His looks are just taken out of context.  They are.  You know what?  Girls fucking just find him so endearing.  No, girls love Jim.  And they love Jimmy.  Yeah.  They love Jimmy.  What about the West?  And he's despicable.  It's not what he's fucking saying. 
[02:27:00]  No.  I don't understand it.  It annoys me.  I'll tell you what.  It's got a charm to him.  What about the hats, though?  They forgot about the matching hats they had.  Coming back from West Palm Beach.  Oh, God, the West Palm Beach hats.  They went into the souvenir shop and got...  Matching palm tree hats and then walking the other laughing.  And they walked back to the seats going, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You can't even describe the colors of the hats.  They were such bright neon.  They were so god-awful.  Pink and a light purple.  Was it a pink?  Yeah, they were awful.  They were awful.  You were a horridly obnoxious couple.  Yeah, it was great. 
[02:27:30]  It was hysterical.  Yeah, she really makes me laugh.  Yeah.  Yeah, fun.  Then I just, I say little things.  Like, um, goodnight, angel.  Amanda, Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, Amanda.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to tell you guys have the best show ever.  You guys keep me company.  Oh, really?  During my long days of driving.  Thank you.  Is it cold in Buffalo today?  It is, 31 degrees.  31's not cold for Buffalo? 
[02:28:00]  Um, it's actually, yeah, pretty warm, I guess.  Yeah?  But I'm actually not in Buffalo.  I'm actually just outside of Rochester right now.  What town?  What's up?  What town in Rochester area?  Uh, we're on the 90th at a service station.  Okay.  Well, what do you like the show?  Yeah.  What do you like about the show, Amanda?  You guys are going to, like, laugh.  They never, oh my God.  You're batting 1,000.  You're batting 1,000 with that. 
[02:28:30]  And it's been two years.  Anyway.  Should we get it to, it's quick, but should we do the American Idol?  You watch American Idol, Louie?  I haven't seen it this year, but I always do.  Do you like the show?  You seem like the type of guy you couldn't be bothered by this crap.  I like watching the, um, the, the early round auditions.  When they're goofing on the retards.  Yeah.  Once they're there.  Two different shows.  Yeah.  Once they're there, I couldn't, I really hate it.  It's two different shows.  It's the freak show, make fun of retarded people. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Which is great.  For the show, which is great.  Yeah.  And then there's the talent show, star search portion.  Who cares?  Where it's, yeah.  Well, when it's, uh, early, I like it because I love watching somebody just off the street,  actually sweating a little from being outside.  Yeah.  Totally convinced that they're awesome.  Yeah.  And sucking.  And all the people also, it shows you that part of American culture where people like,  I got self-respected.  I know I'm somebody.  Yeah.  If you're not anybody, you shouldn't think you are.  You should be, you should say, I'm not anybody.  Maybe I will be if I work hard. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  If I really put, apply myself to something, but just people that automatically walk around  with their shitty lives.  They already think they're somebody.  I'm somebody special.  Well, not yet.  You could be.  Because they convince people within their little circle that they're somebody.  Yeah.  So now, of course, America's going to fall suit.  Every year, there's the guy or the girl, too, that is, uh, just completely stinks, is thrown  out.  And on the way out, they're like, well, the show's going to suffer because I'm not on it.  Like, you just, you just lost so many viewers. 
[02:30:00]  You're lost.  You're lost.  And it's your loss.  Because if I was on the show, the ratings would be, and it's the biggest ratings ever.  And then year after year, they just keep going up.  You're lost.  Taco Bell's game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're lucky to have me.  You haven't seen the last of me.  Let me tell you.  I'm going to go play.  And then, and not one of those people have I seen doing anything.  We have seen the last of you.  Yeah, we did.  And then the people, the people at Fox are like, oh, wow, we could have had 37 million  10 listeners instead.  We only have 37 million this week. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, well.  This was the highlight, Sundance Head.  Oh, yeah.  That guy could sing.  Holy shit could this guy sing.  Last night wasn't about the freak show.  They didn't have great freaks, really.  They had a couple.  They did a monte of some freaks.  Sundance Head has a very famous father named Roy?  Roy Head?  Head.  No, Block, I think his name is.  He runs the Catholic League.  Right.  Block Head.  Well, listen then.  Listen to this guy.  Right.  Your name, sir, is? 
[02:31:00]  Sundance Head.  Uh, I don't have to go after that, is there?  Okay, Sundance.  You're having a lucky year, it says here.  Yes, sir.  Why is that?  I got married to my wife I've been with for seven years.  Unlucky.  I'm having a baby that's due Christmas Day.  Not great news.  And I made it to American Island.  All right.  One out of three.  What are you going to sing?  Stormy Monday, Bob.  Bobby Blue Bland.  Okay.  Ready?  You know they call it Stormy Monday, babe. 
[02:31:30]  White guy.  Lord, now today's just as bad.  You know Wednesday's even worse.  Oh, and Thursday's oh so sad.  You know the year flies on Friday, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  The rain's.  Yeah, Mark.  Saturday goes out to play.  Lord, when Sunday rolls around.  Lord, I get down on my knees and I pray.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  That fucking guy is going to go far in this contest, man.  With a nice gun.  And also after getting shit on by Out of Bullet Simon. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, I know.  For no reason.  And fuck you, also.  Unlucky.  Yeah.  Basically.  I just got married.  You suck.  Yeah.  You watch the cunt.  I had a child.  Fucking retard.  Go ahead and sing now.  Yeah, not sing.  What you didn't hear in that clip.  He talks about his father, Roy Head, who had a number one hit with Treat Her Right.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And his father absolutely hates the Beatles because he was knocked off the charts by a  little song called Yesterday.  A little song called Yesterday. 
[02:33:00]  Just fucked up Roy Head's career.  And now this is his son.  And this is what the judges had to say.  You know what?  Wait.  Before you do that, I knew a guy who fucked up Roy Head's career.  No, it didn't.  There was this guy we knew.  He was in a doo-wop band.  He used to frequent a bar.  My mother tended a bar out in Comac.  And he would always talk about how the Beatles fucked him up, fucked his career up.  He would have been huge. 
[02:33:30]  Like doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop.  Yeah, that was going to go forever.  Never going to end it.  No one was going to change that.  You know, the Beatles came along and that music all of a sudden was your fucking parents' music.  And the Beatles was the new shit that the kids listened to.  But if it wasn't for the Beatles, to this day, 2007, brand new song.  Let's listen to it.  Also the Rolling Stones and The Who. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, they were all fans that just came out.  The British Invasion, it was called.  An invasion.  Not just four guys.  It was an invasion.  We got the Roy Head song from back in the day.  Treat it right.  Roy Head.  A little rockin'.  Yeah, my man.  Yeah, my man.  The white guy sounded black, yeah.  All right.  The white man just completely ripped off the black man and then sucked his dick. 
[02:34:30]  That a context, sorry.  Oh, you're looking good, baby.  Does he sing?  Holy crap.  Let's go.  While we're young.  Yeah, it's the Beatles' fault.  Yeah.  Fucking non-singing dork.  I want to tell you a story.  All right, here he goes.  All right, here we go.  Every man ought to know.  If you want a little love, everything.  It's all right.  You ever hear this song before?  It's fine.  No, I was too busy listening to it yesterday.  Yeah, she's going to love you tonight if you just treat her right now. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  I'll squeeze a real jump.  All right, enough of Roy Head.  But that's so different than what the Beatles were doing.  It's like the 50s to the 60s, man.  That would have been dead anyway.  That's funny.  30 years later, Bob.  Wow.  Yeah.  Of course not.  That music was never going to die.  Well, this is what the judges had to say about Sundance Head.  Powerful voice.  Didn't expect it.  We're in Memphis, and you come and sing a blues song and blew it out.  Man, you sounded great, dude.  Amazing.  Thank you.  Probably one of the best voices we've heard on the audition tour this year. 
[02:35:30]  Thank you.  I agree.  In every way.  Yay.  Randy, yes or no?  100 million percent yes.  This boy's the bomb.  Great audition.  Great voice.  Yes.  I'm going to be amazed if you don't make the final.  I thought it was terrific.  Well done.  Welcome to Hollywood, baby.  Welcome to Hollywood, Sundance Head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That guy can say.  I think it blew Taylor apart. 
[02:36:00]  Dude, I'm saying a circle.  Blew Taylor apart?  Yeah.  He basically said this guy is so much better than Taylor Hicks, who won last year's American  Idol.  Yeah, because it's like that genre, trying to be soulful and stuff, and that was Taylor  Hicks' whole MO when he went up on the stage.  And this guy just got out there and just completely chewed him apart.  He's a big guy.  He's fat.  Not like that type of disgusting, big, huge, gut, fat belly, but he's like one of those 
[02:36:30]  big guys.  He's wide.  Kind of like how Steve used to look back in the day.  Yeah.  Kind of gay.  He's got like some wacky big beard thing going on.  Oh, like where the beard has a couple of tears to it?  Just the chin, and it comes down, yeah, and then the edges come down a little further.  Yeah, he doesn't really commit to a full goatee or just the little chin thing.  Yeah, it's the chin thing, and it kind of goes down, but he's, you know, looking like 
[02:37:00]  a soul guy.  The other one worth playing from last night, then we could obviously move on to some more  exciting things, this Melinda girl, the backup singer.  Oh, right, the backup singer.  This girl's been singing backup for some very famous artists all her life, and this woman,  this girl Melinda, is scared of her own shout-outs.  Yeah, she comes in, she's got her hands in front of her, she's got her head down, and  she walks up to the mic and just belts it out, but she's scared shitless up there. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, I like what, that's one reason I like to watch the show, too, is people.  Yeah, it's like real people, you know.  Actually getting to be on, you know, taking a shot, and when a waitress takes a break  from her job, and runs down there and sings, and they give her a shot.  That's awesome.  35 million people are going to see you.  Yeah.  Here you go, and go.  And people complain about the contracts they get, but in fairness, they really are taking  you from nowhere and making you a household name.  You're plucking these people.  I mean, look at that, not even a winner of American Idol is now an Oscar nominee. 
[02:38:00]  Just out of nowhere.  Where would this chick be?  Where the fuck would she have been?  She came in like, fuck it, when did she come in?  She'd be a singing waitress somewhere.  She wasn't even second.  She was like fifth.  Yeah.  Something.  She'd be fucking eating asses off Chrysler and humming tunes.  I'm going to be somebody, somebody.  Yeah, whatever, shut up.  So here's Melinda, scared of her own shadow, nervous, can't even look at the judges, looking 
[02:38:30]  down, sweaty palms, just like all like crunched up.  Yeah.  Like this, with her shoulders way up, and this is what came out of her.  So you're Melinda Doolittle.  I am.  Doolittle.  And what do you do?  I sing background vocals for different artist session work, and then I travel quite a bit.  Do you hate every single person you're singing backing vocals for?  I don't.  No, truthfully.  Okay, truthfully.  Do you think, fall off the stage, break your leg, and I'll take your place?  Because he hates everybody that he works with. 
[02:39:00]  For me, it's fun, and I've always kind of loved being in the background.  It's my comfort zone, so that's been my fun little place, and I can be there, and they  can do their thing.  And what's changed?  I just, I know that for me, I need to get over the fear of standing in front of people  myself.  Okay, what'd you sing it?  For Once in My Life, Stevie Wonder.  I love that song.  Okay.  You do?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  I love Stevie, too.  For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me, not like it's hurt me before. 
[02:39:30]  For once I have someone I know won't desert me.  I'm not alone anymore.  For once I can say, this is mine, you can't take it.  As long as I know, I have a love I can make it.  For once in my life, I've got someone who needs me.  Jesus. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  She's not white.  No.  No.  She's not white.  No, only the whip can get a sound like that.  No way.  Years of whipping.  A nasty boat ride can sound like that.  No milk-fed whitey's going to bother to sing that well.  Nope.  We don't have to.  Lucky Louie on DVD coming this Tuesday.  Oh, God damn.  That is fucking great.  Every time you kill for us, we'll give you a nice plug there.  So then she sang that and then went right back into her shell, all shy, looking back down 
[02:40:30]  at the floor.  Wow.  What do you think, Paula?  You're good.  You're really good.  Thank you.  You got it.  I have.  I have to shake it, but thank you.  You look scared to death, man.  You are.  I'm good.  Manny?  Thank you.  I always have this thing about, if you're a background singer for a long time, I don't  know if you can really come up front and be that solo singer.  Because, you know, most of the solo lead singers have that kind of Simon Cowell thing. 
[02:41:00]  You know, they only think about themselves.  Okay.  Simon, wouldn't you agree?  Uh, Melinda, we have a lot of people who come in here with a lot of attitude, a lot  of confidence, and they're not very good.  You walk in with no confidence, no attitude, and yet you are a brilliant singer.  Yeah.  A brilliant singer.  Thank you.  Seriously.  Look at that look on your face.  I scared the doubt.  But, you know, you are what it's all about. 
[02:41:30]  A great voice.  I am concerned about the lack of confidence, about the fact that you've been in the background.  But let me tell you, you are in the top 2% of good singers this year.  That's true.  1 million percent yes.  A million percent?  I think you're brilliant.  Yes.  I think you're sensational.  One of the best auditions ever, vocally.  I agree.  Welcome to Hollywood!  Woo!  Yeah!  Woo!  Do they ever disagree?  The judges occasionally disagree.  But does Simon ever say yes, and the others say no? 
[02:42:00]  I've never seen him say yes to them saying no.  Wow, that is very rare.  That's true, and it hardly ever happens.  There was one that they put through.  It was Randy that said no, and the other two said yes.  Well, it can't be that, right?  It's almost two out of the three.  One of the whites says yes.  People say it.  She'll do well.  Hearing the train wrecks is much better, but there weren't many train wrecks yet.  Nah, nah.  Nothing like the bush baby kid and the fat retarded gentleman. 
[02:42:30]  And the rest of them.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  We're going to get into some spanking after the break.  What?  Who's spanking who?  Louie's got kids.  We'll get his thoughts on this.  Oh, that type of real, like, legitimate kid spanking.  And something we could all relate to, a screaming kid on a plane.  That's a great story.  We'll get into next as well.  Lucky Louie.  Tuesday.  January 30th.  Tuesday on DVD.  Pre-order now.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Whether you like it, medium, bitty, medium, or enormous.

[02:43:30]  Louie C.K. in studio.  Killing once again today.  Oh, man.  Got to say hi to Jason in Arizona.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  I've got a rip-off alert for you guys. 
[02:44:00]  A rip-off alert.  Did you buy that new show on Showtime, Lucky Larry?  This morning hack show in Phoenix, Arizona.  And it's called Holgrim's Morning Sickness.  Wait, what is it called?  Holgrim's Morning Sickness?  Holgrim's Morning Sickness.  I don't know the characters' names.  Yeah, they are sick.  But they're betting on the Super Bowl, and one of his posse, if he loses the bet, has 
[02:44:30]  to do the baby bird.  Oh, really?  And, yeah, what piqued my interest was Ralphie May is in concert down there this weekend.  He phoned in to the radio show, and he's on part of the attack.  It's like he's Pavarotti.  He's going to be out there.  Ralphie May in concert.  What'd you say?  I thought he was your guy's boy.  He was in on the bet somehow.  I only caught a little bit of it.  Well, Ralphie, I'll only say this. 
[02:45:00]  He wasn't around when baby bird happened, so maybe he hasn't been informed.  Oh, I see.  That's possible.  He just didn't know.  Well, it being on YouTube and all the...  I'm not going to say he definitely saw it.  I mean, who knows?  Ralphie's a homosexual.  You know what's worse than that, though, Jason?  A fucking rat.  Tattletail.  A fucking rat.  Snitches get stitches.  I tried to phone in and call him on it, but I couldn't get through.  I listen to you guys, and I just happen to be tooling around the FM. 
[02:45:30]  He didn't know he was the rat.  I'd hit him with a sound effect, but I have no templates.  Yeah, don't tell him.  Let me just randomly...  Was that supposed to be sexy?  I'll just randomly press buttons because...  Where's your templates?  I don't have...  I don't have...  They weren't given that to me.  Because somebody slacked off.  Whose job is that?  I want to know whose job it is.  Whose job is that?  E-Rock.  E-Rock again?  No, not your job.  No, whose job is it?  I've never been informed as to whose job it is, because when it happens, I'm never told. 
[02:46:00]  Watch.  Whose job is it supposed to be?  Is it yours?  I'm never going to answer.  I think it needs to be assigned.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  I'll just assign it to somebody.  Yeah, good.  Very good.  I'll assign it to somebody, and then if it's not done, that head rolls, and then whoever  really was supposed to do it feels all guilty.  That's how government works.  Right.  No, when you get an appointment in government, dude, this is your job now, you're in trouble.  Yeah.  That means we need someone to take a fall. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, we're going to promote you.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Hey, Mike from Tampa, I love the commercial with Donald Trump that just aired on XM.  You slobs.  What was that?  Was it a promo for the show with Donald Trump, or was it a commercial?  What was it?  Yeah, what was it?  It might have been when they fired off the brakes, something was there.  Nothing we played in between.  So what was it?  Was it a...  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding, right, Bill?  It would have to be in...  You didn't answer the question. 
[02:47:00]  Poor Bill.  He can't press a button right or talk.  Does anyone know the answer to the question?  Steve, answer?  No, I don't know.  I love this place.  Nobody kind of pays attention.  This place is fan-fucking-tastic.  It could have been an ad for Stern Show on Sirius, and nobody would know it.  And no one would know why, where it came from.  We have to wait for a listener to catch it.  We don't hear the spots here.  Uh-huh.  Any of us.  Way to humiliate us.  We're being funny.  Yeah, sure.  I would hate to let...  Hey, the facts get in the way, Jim. 
[02:47:30]  My bad.  So when it goes to dead air, like, that's one of us, unless we were...  That's when Washington is doing their thing.  Exactly.  And then they...  All right, all right.  Well, fair enough.  It's just funny.  We have to learn this stuff from the listeners, though.  Is it a commercial for one of his, like, real estate money-making seminars?  I have no idea.  Because I know he does that.  That's the only thing I've heard.  University or whatever.  Yeah.  He has a school.  Yeah.  He's always hawking that convention thing that he does down at the Javits Center, where 
[02:48:00]  he goes down and, I'll tell you how to be rich.  First, have a rich father.  Then...  Yeah.  That helps.  Use his money to get richer.  Build more buildings with that money.  Sell them for more money.  Yeah.  And before you know it, you're rich.  Go ahead now.  Go ahead and enjoy that.  Oh, and do an occasional seminar, because I'm taking your money.  Yeah.  Why didn't he help you get a play zone?  Oh, that was just all bullshit for the radio.  Like, what do you have gotten...  I actually try to call his people.  They could give a flying fuck about me and the fact that I need a place to live. 
[02:48:30]  What did they say when you called him?  So, we don't want slobs living in the building.  Take the message.  We'll get back to you.  You know, the blow-off stuff.  How stupid is that?  Like...  Whatever.  That's ridiculous.  Real stupid.  He'll get another person in there in a second.  Trump buildings just fill up.  It doesn't matter.  No, but it's not even about the Trump buildings, which, you know, if you want to live in a snooty  place like that, fine.  Yeah.  It's simply about the promotion, like, just for his name.  It's like, why wouldn't you do that? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  It doesn't make sense.  It was whatever.  Hey, Sammy from Queens says, Trump commercial is about the learning addicts.  The learning addicts.  There you go.  Okay.  Thank you.  Let's move on to this kid on the flight.  I love this.  I would have loved to have been on this flight.  Of course, I would never travel AirTran.  No.  No first class.  What is that AirTran?  That used to be Value Jet.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Until that one went into the Everglades.  I always liked that that had a funny smiley face on the airplanes.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Like, you want your planes to be funny and silly? 
[02:49:30]  Smiley.  That plane looks hilarious.  Yeah.  The tail logo was a plane with a big smile, and it was kind of curled up like a shrimp.  Yeah.  It was laughing like a plane should bend like that.  As it went into the drink, it was going, yee-hee-hee-hee.  Yeah, like, no matter how horrific, there's screaming people inside.  It's in flames going down, yet that tail is smiling.  Well, it's not smiling when it's upside down in the swamp.  No, no.  Oh, no.  Just wham.  It looks like a frown.  Aw.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  So, how did they solve that problem? 
[02:50:00]  They got out the old paint roller and put AirTran on it, and they want us to forget.  Yep.  Yeah.  Right after that happened, as a matter of fact, short little story, we were fired from Boston,  and they were flying us around.  We were being courted.  We were being courted by other stations, and we got our tickets, and it was for AirTran.  And I was like, dude, this is ValuJet.  They just painted over the fucking planes.  Yeah.  This has nothing to do with, it's not a new airline, just because it's got a new paint 
[02:50:30]  job.  And that was when I was beyond scared of flying, so I was on a payphone.  Oh, yeah.  You were just giving Bob shit.  Just giving our agents shit, the people that were flying us down shit.  So, she got us the cheapest fucking airline that just crashed into the Everglades, and  they paint the plane.  It's still wet.  It's like tacky.  Like, I got a little ritual where I have to kind of pat the plane a couple of times before  I go in the door.  Mm-hmm.  I kind of give it like a ding-ding, yeah, get us there, buddy. 
[02:51:00]  You got wet paint on your fingers.  Yeah, there's like wet paint.  Like, what is that?  And I'm seeing kind of a smiley face playing underneath it.  This is a red fucking car, Rudy.  Yeah.  Wait, did you ever, you really, you really tap it when you walk on the plane?  Yeah, I give the side of the door.  My right, my middle, the right knuckle, the knuckle of my right middle finger, I have to  go like this, on the outside of the plane.  Yeah, I give two taps with, not the palm of my hand, but the tips of my fingers.  I go like, dunk-dunk to the right side of the door. 
[02:51:30]  I do too.  I have to do that, and then I have to put my cock in the cockpit and yell Allah Akbar  and go sit down.  It's just a ritual.  But then you know everything's going to be fine.  Yeah.  I don't know, yeah, a little ritual.  Everyone does.  It's probably going to be so many people do things like that, that rapid decompression  of the plane because some idiots are knocking next to the door.  They're wearing.  It's weak in the aluminum.  Yeah, they're wearing that out.  A rivet popped out.  Investigation has determined tapping.  All right, what happened on the plane? 
[02:52:00]  Well, flight attendants often deal with it.  You're going to want to kill the kid and the parents.  Obnoxious passengers, usually, the flight attendants, who won't listen to the instructions,  and they kick them off the plane.  Massachusetts couple, think Air Tran Airways went overboard by treating their crying three-year-old  daughter in much the same way.  Julie and Jerry Cal-cools-cols.  Julie and Jerry.  Julie and Jerry Forn.  Yes, exactly. 
[02:52:30]  Julie and Jerry Donahue and daughter Ellie were removed from the flight when the girl refused  to take her seat before takeoff.  But the parents said they just needed a little more time to calm her down.  Get her in the seat.  There's the problem.  Get her in the seat.  Get her in the fucking seat.  Just take her physically and put her in the fucking seat.  Pick her up.  Grab her by the hair.  Yeah.  But they had just visited her Grammy to Grammy.  Yeah.  So I guess she was upset with leaving Grammy. 
[02:53:00]  Who cares?  She was removed because she was climbing under the seat and hitting her parents and wouldn't  get in her seat.  Put her in the seat physically.  Get in the fucking seat.  You've got to calm her down, don't you?  What?  Put her in the seat.  Put her in the seat.  Put her in the seat.  Put her in the seat.  Put her in the seat.  Yeah.  But the thing is, they're just shitty travelers.  Right.  There's a whole system to put it.  I've traveled with two kids.  I've got a two-year-old and a five-year-old.  And we travel with them all the time.  Oh.  And you've got to get your fucking shit put away fast so that you have time to calm  your kids.  They're just fucking assholes. 
[02:53:30]  They don't know.  Right.  They're just like those people that...  Like, you know when you see on an airplane where you're starting a taxi and a guy just  gets up like a cunt, just stands up and goes in the overhead?  And the plane stops and you hear, we need everyone to sit there.  It's usually a fucking Hasid, by the way, who just looks at the front of the plane like,  what?  They don't...  They're just going to get my money or whatever.  We need all passengers to be seated and belted in for the taxi. 
[02:54:00]  And by all passengers, I mean the one guy that's standing up.  So I'm going to chastise everybody like you're all assholes because one fucking asshole.  All you people that were belted in and just reading and paying attention to the rules because  you're experiencing this flying thing, you're all assholes too because one fuck stood up.  Thank you.  Enjoy the flight.  It would be funny if they chastised him specifically if they said, we appreciate all of you being  in your seats, except for you, the Jew with the fat wife. 
[02:54:30]  Would you please sit down so we can taxi?  Get your stupid ass in the fucking seat.  No, so these people are just incompetent.  I mean, I've...  Yep.  Look, I don't believe in...  People that hate babies on flights, I think, are assholes.  Like, when my baby is crying and people, like, crane their necks to look back, like, could  you turn off that machine that makes that noise?  I fucking looked them in the face like, please actually say something so I can piss in your  mouth.  It's like, it's a fucking child, you fucking piece of shit. 
[02:55:00]  We're taxiing.  You know, we're very good at keeping our kids quiet.  They don't cry through flights.  But if my daughter goes like, eh, eh, eh, fucking some rich asshole, like, rustles his newspaper  in the back of me like, whoa, this is unheard of.  And I look in this...  I love it.  I look right in their face.  I've been with this kid all fucking day.  I would love to unload unfairly on a string.  Wow.  Give me a reason.  No, it's great to see the other side, because there's no one in this room that's going to  agree with you, Louis.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  People hate kids crying.  But it's great to see the other side of it, because we, yeah, we want to turn around 
[02:55:30]  and tell the shit.  I want the parents to treat the child like that Korean woman treated that chicken in  the last episode of Mad.  Right.  That's what I want.  Damn you, you made me remember that.  Yeah, no, exactly.  It was a chicken.  It was a chicken, right?  Holy fuck.  I'm at...  It's very simple.  I just want the parents to at least try.  That's the...  Yeah, that's the thing.  I hate parents.  I hate parents.  I get frustrated they're still crying, but at least try to do something.  And for the four hours, break your fucking parent rules. 
[02:56:00]  Like, if there's no candy allowed before dinner, and the kid's crying for candy, fucking send  them into diabetic shock.  No, you're absolutely right.  And they should have kicked them off.  If the kid is not in his fucking seat, he's a liability.  Fucking kick the whole family off.  Absolutely.  And they did.  They did, and they should have.  Yeah, just the kid, and the kid's standing there on the empty jetway, you just see him  like crawling dangerously close to the edge.  No, no, most parents are fucking idiots, and I hate parents on airplanes that don't. 
[02:56:30]  Like, I saw this guy flying with his daughter, and she's crying, and he doesn't...  Like, he's a guy, so he just sits back.  Does it...  All he has to do is hold her for a second.  Right.  Won't do it.  Why the fuck?  And a mother I saw once is feeding Mountain Dew and M&M's to her fucking kid.  There you go.  Whose face is purple with sugar rage by the end of the...  And fucking caffeine.  Idiots.  Are you ever embarrassed?  Like, I understand, like, Geraldo made a good point with time. 
[02:57:00]  He goes, I know it's annoying, but what do you want people to do?  Not travel with kids?  It's like, you have to.  And they aren't kids, they're not machines.  Well, the reason I hate people that complain is because they have no...  They'll complain about anything.  Like, again, my daughter had a rattle once.  She's not actually speaking...  We give her a rattle so that she'll be pacified.  She's rattling a rattle as we're taxing.  And people are looking at me like, oh, come on.  Yeah.  Well, fuck you.  Get on your cell phone and call your fucking girlfriend and let me hear that now.  You fucking adult cunt.  What?  Once the engines really crank up, it's really hard to hear anything around you anyway. 
[02:57:30]  But it is that when you're boarding, the taxiing, when you get a kid crying, it's not...  I won't do the turnaround, but my shoulders go up and that sound, I'm like, I can't take  baby crying sound.  Right.  To me, it's the old nails on the blackboard.  Sure.  But you know what is good now?  iPods.  Everyone has...  Can't you put your fucking iPod... 
[02:58:00]  Because I have one and I won't notice a kid crying.  So what you're saying is take it and hit the kid with it repeatedly, holding it with your  earbuds?  I don't even realize a kid is crying.  I swear to God, like someone would go, why is that kid crying?  And I realize, oh, I'm fingering it.  Uh-oh, here comes Bill Donahue.  Before you finish the story, Eric in Colorado, this just sounds completely insane.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, a couple years ago, my wife and I were flying out of Denver, and this guy kept standing 
[02:58:30]  up on the plate, and the stewardess told him twice to sit down.  On the third time, he was standing, and the cockpit door was open, and this was before 9-11.  The pilot slammed on the brakes on the taxiway.  The guy went face first to the ground and broke his nose.  Awesome.  The stewardess out of another passenger looked at the guy and said, they told you to sit down.  Why would he keep standing? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, no, I've seen that so many times.  By the way, Craig is just stupid.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Yeah, and Sam jumped up and started pointing, like, this Craig right here.  Sam can't wait to get in the middle of this.  What happened?  Well, I would have never went.  The phone said in mid-flight, the pilot jammed on the brakes.  Right, mid-flight.  So that's why we went to the phone call thinking it'd be, you know, we could point out how stupid  this guy is.  Like, I can understand if the pilot wants to, like, hit those, the air brakes and put 
[02:59:30]  the engines into reverse at 35,000 feet.  Like a top gun?  Yeah, like that.  Let him pass me.  Let him pass me.  And da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  But do you really want a pilot that's that into fucking someone else, that he's just going  to stop the plane?  We're going to do a barrel roll now, and then knock this guy's head off the fucking roof.  But Craig's having a tough day.  He's learning the ropes.  He's learning the ropes.  He has roofs.  Yeah, the story continues. 
[03:00:00]  There's rules.  She climbed under the seat, wouldn't get out.  Said they were following FAA rules that children age two and above have to have their own seat  and be wearing a seatbelt.  The flight was already delayed 15 minutes.  And in fairness to the other 112 passengers on the plane, the crew made an operational  decision to remove the family.  Good for them.  We were given an opportunity to hold her, console her or anything.  Warrant given, sorry.  Ellie was sitting in front of our seat crying. 
[03:00:30]  The attendant motioned to a seat and asked if we purchased it for her.  They had paid for the seat.  Jerry said, another attendant, yes.  Big problem here is that it sounds from what they're saying that the little girl was sitting  by herself and the parents were sitting together behind her.  Yeah, what's that about?  Yeah, because, and parents that do this fucking are the worst.  That they put their kid, if three, if there's two parents and a kid traveling, like I sat 
[03:01:00]  next to some little girl on the flight here from L.A. recently, her parents are sitting  together eating and having a great time.  I'm fucking raising their kids.  Oh my God.  You're raising the kids for that part and a half hour.  I'm helping her with her juice.  I'm listening to her fucking cunty little stories about her grandma.  I don't want to hear any of it.  Why they weren't good stories?  She said, do you want to play my game, boy?  No, I got fucking work to do.  I'm trying to watch softcore porn on my fucking DVD player and mom and dad are canoodling.  Or they're having a great time on the other seat having fucking margaritas and shit. 
[03:01:30]  Another cocktail here, please.  No, they're sitting, that's, and that's why she's crawling under the seat to get to her  parents because they're not sitting with her.  It should have been the mom and the kid or the dad and the kid and then the one parent,  and the reason I'll tell you why that didn't happen is because the parents fought.  I'm not sitting with her.  No, I fucking sat with her on the way to grandma's, oh, well, let's just make that stranger  say with them.  Let Louis C.K.  Yeah.  Let's let him.  Yeah.  Fucking asshole. 
[03:02:00]  Do you want to say something to the parents?  They should have been thrown off the plane while it was in flight.  They should have been thrown off from 30,000 feet, Goldfinger, right through the window.  You thought they would say something, though.  You want to say something to the parents?  I would, you know, if they were there, I would, especially if there was a problem and it  was holding up the plane.  I think I would have said, why isn't she sitting with you?  You guys stink.  I hate you.  I'm sure people would have just mumble.  Fucking people.  I bet they got applause.  I hope they got applause.  Yeah.  Her cunty little stories. 
[03:02:30]  Cunty little stories.  She's won.  They told the family, you need to get her in control and in her seat.  The couple told the attendant they were trying.  Julie said she asked the attendants if Ellie could sit on her lap, but they said no.  The family flew home the next day.  Wait a minute.  Were there three seats?  And she was in, they might have been three seats together.  But what they're saying there is that she, we're trying to get that she was, what was  the one sentence back?  That she was in front of them?  Yeah.  It's the seat in front of us.  She wouldn't get into her seat. 
[03:03:00]  They were, um, she was like under the seat.  Yeah, but then right before.  No, she was sitting in front of the parents.  I think they mean like on the floor in front of them.  Like, say it's parent, empty seat, parent.  I think the kid just crawled out of her seat and was sitting on the floor in front of her  parents.  She was climbing under the seat and hitting her parents and wouldn't get in her seat.  And then what's the, and then what's the next thing?  Children under two and above must have their own seat and be wearing a seat belt upon 
[03:03:30]  takeoff.  And then?  The flight was delayed 15 minutes.  Yeah.  In fairness to the other passengers, they were removed.  We weren't given an opportunity to hold her, console her, or anything.  Ellie was sitting in front of our seat crying.  Oh, so you're saying she's sitting on the floor.  Maybe she was on the floor, like where you put your little fucking bag.  I'm sticking in.  I am enjoying my anger.  I'm sticking out.  Stick where you started.  It makes a lot more fun.  We got a guy that looks like he was on the flight.  Larry in Florida.  What's up? 
[03:04:00]  Hi.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  My son's a big fan of you guys.  I've never really heard you.  You guys are funny, though.  I'll tell you what.  Thanks.  I was on this flight when this happened, and it started, they were just kind of, this  little girl was really upset.  She was, you know, obviously, she was more tired than anything.  And, you know, I've got three daughters myself, so I know what that's like when they're  kids and they haven't slept.  I'm calling Papa Sierra.  I think they were in Disneyland or something.  I don't know.  Let's just see where he goes with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And?  And then I said, 
[03:04:30]  Get this shitting bitch off the plane!  We're so on to him, like right from the start.  Jimmy gives me a look like, I'm already looking up at the name, like, this guy just  isn't.  Who is this guy?  He was a punk.  Just someone who thought he'd get us.  He was a blockhead.  He was a what?  A blockhead.  You blockhead.  That's my new favorite.  Why, you?  Insult. 
[03:05:00]  Blockhead.  Nerds to you.  Don't be a blockhead.  Well, get this.  The family flew home the next day.  The Orlando-based carrier reimbursed the family about 600 bucks, the cost of the three  tickets, and offered them three round-trip tickets anywhere the airline flies.  But it's too little, too late for the kules, Saz.  The father said they would never fly AirTran again.  What a shame.  You're shitting over the first time.  Wait.  Where do they live?  Let's try to get them on the phone.  Yeah.  Call them up.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey. 
[03:05:30]  Joe?  Get them immediately.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  First, I love your field special.  It was great.  Thank you.  With the fuck you kids and all that.  Oh, yeah.  I'll tell you what.  I tell my kids I want to do that every day.  Thanks, man.  Number two is I was coming home from Florida two weeks ago, and we had a problem with we  were about to land into Newark, and my daughter was sleeping on my wife's lap, and the stewardess  asked my wife to put, you know, put the seatbelt on before we land, and my wife said, well, you 
[03:06:00]  know, she's sleeping.  We let her sleep.  And the stewardess said, well, no, you've got to put the seatbelt on, so my wife starts  arguing with her, and basically it came down to, she told my wife, but we will not land  the plane.  We're going to have authorities at the airport and let you do this.  You know, the stewardess are pretty much assholes on the flight.  Dude, you've got to strap your kid in, you know, it's the thing is, something happened  to the kid, and your kid, like, slammed its face against the fucking train. 
[03:06:30]  The thing that people don't understand, and there's a million comedians that make hay of  this stupid fucking, I hate stand-up comedy that's based on ignorance, the whole thing  of, like, put your seatbelt on, like, that's going to help if we crash into a mountain.  Yeah, that's what they're for, you fucking dunce.  They're there for when you're taxiing, because when you're fucking land, you're going about  150 miles per hour.  Sure, Louis C.K. runes bit for hundreds of hack comics, the film.  That's an 11.  If the plane wheel hits a chuck hole in the runway or something, you could, your head could 
[03:07:00]  go slamming, and the reason to put the seat goes up, so, sir, it's important, it's a  federal fucking regulation, if something happened to your kid, the flight attendant would be  run out on a rail and sued and everything.  He's just lucky, fucking lucky goody-two-shoes, if you're going to call that show.  My chippa-tooth.  No, here's the thing, though.  I understand what you're saying, and Louis is technically correct.  You tell the story.  But they have, in the airline industry, turned into a bunch of just fucking, just, they're 
[03:07:30]  just a blind robotic twats.  Like, I was on the plane today with DIC in Chicago, and I had my laptop open, the cabin  door's closed, and the captain gets on and goes, oh, we got to DIC, we're going to be  about 20 minutes before pushback.  So I'm on the laptop.  30 seconds later, the stewardess walks by, and goes, you have to close that, sir.  I'm like, but he just said there's going to be a 20-minute delay.  20 minutes.  She goes, I know, but the doors are closed.  So I closed it, but I'm just like, you fucking cunt. 
[03:08:00]  Like, he just said 20-minute delay.  Like, I understand if we're backing up, but you heard him say it.  You know who ruins that?  Who?  Other people that would just do it.  The door would close.  Like, they got to make the rules so basic.  They can't say.  Well, because...  When the door closes, unless we're DICing and there's a delay, because then there'd just  be everybody, hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I got the folder here with me, and I'm...  No, because she's basically caring for a fucking 200 children.  Everybody on a plane is a child.  And if she had to go, like, make these Solomon-like rulings for every single... 
[03:08:30]  You opened it after the DICing.  However, you...  And it would just go to hell.  You are an idiot.  You are okay.  You're a fucking mongoloid.  Yeah.  There's a power trip.  Absolutely right.  There's a power trip thing going on, too.  Yeah, that federally...  That they're federally...  But, I mean, she could obviously look past that, but she has this little bit of power  and she wants to just kind of...  No, and it comes down to the people, because most of the time you get up, like, they'll  say, now it's absolutely federally, and I get up and piss. 
[03:09:00]  You guys take it late.  All the time.  The point was, the first half hour of my trip, my wife, my daughter was screaming, so she  was quiet, so my wife was like, hey, let's keep her quiet, you know, keep it down.  We had a half hour to land.  And then what happened?  You know what I mean?  We weren't...  That's, you know?  And then what happened?  Well, we put seatbelt on, you know, that was...  That's another thing.  It's like, we have a half hour to land.  It's not the point of the landing, also.  It's the point that when the plane is changing altitude, it's hitting different air, you get 
[03:09:30]  turbulence, the things...  It's not...  No, look, I sympathize.  I know what it's like to fly with kids, but you just have to work within the system  that there's, you know...  Oh, yeah, no, it's understandable.  And the bottom line is this.  I'm sorry.  No, just let me make a point.  If they fucking hit some bumps, and you fall and break your fucking nose, you're going to  sue the airline.  And you're going to sue?  And you're going to settle out of court, and the airline is going to have to pay out some  money, no matter how much your fault it was.  No, but people do...  It depends on who you're...  It depends on who you're...  It depends on who you're at in the end.  It always ends.  Joe Consumer.  Exactly.  I like to say... 
[03:10:00]  I was just...  The Jimmy put me at the point.  It's the robot.  They have no, you know...  No, so you can tell when you're dealing with somebody who's got the ability to decide based  on the human there, or people that...  Like, I checked in a hotel, the heat turned off in my shitty apartment, so I went to the  Mercer Hotel.  Yeah.  And I go down there, and they charge fucking $530 for a room, which is crazy.  That is bizarre what they charge.  But I'm there, and I've got all my crap, so I just go ahead and pay.  And then I'm going to walk in and ask for a room. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  And they give one to me.  I go upstairs, it's tiny, the bed's not even like a whole bed, and the window's wide open  and it's freezing, and it's crazy.  So I just go to the front desk, and I go, I'm bailing, I can't do this.  And she goes, oh, well, you're going to be charged.  I'm like, no, I've been in there for 10 seconds.  Yeah, why?  And she says, well, because you made a reservation and you need 24 hours.  No, I didn't.  I walked in and took the fucking room.  What is that based on?  She says, well, when we rent the room, we're expecting that we're making that rate on that. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, but I've been in there for 10 seconds.  10 fucking seconds.  Now, that's ridiculous.  She says, I'll leave a note for the manager, and tomorrow he'll decide.  I'm like, no, you're not charging my fucking credit card.  And we started yelling at each other, this woman, and then some guy eating an apple walked  by who works there and goes, what are you doing?  Let him just take the charge off.  Right in front of her, you take out your Amex, and you get on your cell phone, you call Amex,  and you look her right in the eye as you're going, yeah, I just had a charge.  I want to take it off, and you guys deal with it. 
[03:11:30]  Like, Amex has thugs that deal with situations like that, and they will fucking, they'll fight  for you, and you tell them what happened, the hotel tells them, and they take the fucking  shit right off your credit card.  Oh, I hated that woman.  If you're fighting up.  The airline thing, though, is like people bringing up little things.  I consider it fucking point A to point B transportation.  I'm not looking to play slot cars in the middle of the lane, the aisle.  I'm not looking to fucking, you know, fun and games. 
[03:12:00]  It's travel.  So I will, I don't care if they're robots, bring me my drink, bring me my food, I'll  buckle up, I'll stay in my seat when they tell me to, and then I'll get off the fucking  plane when I get where I'm at.  The plane isn't the big fucking adventure.  I'm not five years old, like, on a wild journey.  Also, I, you know, not to keep shitting on comedians, but most of them are hard.  So easily shit-onable.  Yeah.  The other thing that comedians make fun of is all the problems, like, how annoying it  is to fly, and you don't like the food. 
[03:12:30]  You're flying through the fucking air.  It's a miracle.  You're flying, it used to take a lifetime, and with most of your family dying, to get  from the east coast to the west coast.  And now, it takes five hours, and 99.9% of the time, there's zero problems.  You're on a Conestoga wagon with Indian shoes and arrows at you.  And these motherfuckers are upset.  I had to put my belt on.  You're hurtling through the fucking cosmos at 500 miles an hour.  The captain was so boring on the thing. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, well, he has an amazing skill, and he is putting his life in your hands and taking  you for $300 to another city thousands of miles away in minutes.  It's almost like a transporter room.  Fucking unappreciative.  It's time to have dinner that day.  Yeah.  That is great.  And the food was weird.  Shut the fuck up.  It gives a shit.  I don't like it.  Let's go to Terry in Georgia.  How's the problem with Louis C.K.? 
[03:13:30]  Take your shit with you, too.  It's not just you.  No.  Bags of your shit, too.  Exactly.  Terry.  Lou, you're such a cock.  What are you doing sticking out for these flying whores?  Get my fucking drink.  Get my meal.  Get me a blanket and shut the fuck up.  They do.  Yeah, that's what they do.  I've never had a problem.  Yeah, when have you not had them do that?  Sitting there going, we're walking out if we don't get service in another five minutes.  Because the second I sit down, would you like a drink?  Here's a menu. 
[03:14:00]  Try it and coach.  What do you have?  I know.  Hey, Jesus.  Oh, is there?  Not everyone flies first class.  Let me tell you something.  A menu.  I was under the impression I was flying a fucking eight-foot-long plane.  He's losing touch.  Oh, my God.  I thought all planes only had five rows.  How much people in coach must hate it when they make those announcements, please split  your seat up and your tray table.  Those of you flying in first class, please let your hooker take the dick out of your mouth. 
[03:14:30]  All dicks out of hookers' mouth.  Put away the DVD player, the massage unit, the fucking...  But a menu.  When we travel, the fucking...  You don't get a menu and the coach will give you a menu and say, this is for lunch.  Eat it or go fuck yourself.  Those are your choices on the menu.  No, most of the airlines, they don't serve food now.  Right.  Yeah.  On cross-country flight, they say, you know...  Not behind that curtain.  Enjoy the fucking McDonald's that...  You're the guy next to you.  We still got to relate to the little people.  I never knew.  I thought everyone got that fine service. 
[03:15:00]  That was really bad.  Silverware.  He was commenting on the flight attendants.  But that's what they do.  I've never had a problem with them.  Yeah, they do bring you your shit and they do shut the fuck up.  Never had a problem with them.  And then, yeah, but there's no way there's anything worse than being a flight attendant.  I don't think that ever...  You have to fucking care for these idiots that you're definitely better than as a person.  Yeah.  No, but when I'm talking about the robots, it's not like them then following those federal  regulations.  Yeah.  It's like when my girlfriend and I were flying and we had our seats together, we booked 
[03:15:30]  them together, and all of a sudden they were different.  So I go up to the lady at the desk and I go, we were booked together.  Yeah.  Why are we separated on the plane now?  And she goes, oh, well, they changed aircraft.  And I'm like, well, I fly a lot.  And it's a 757-300.  The other plane was a 7-300.  So why would they swap out for similar aircraft?  And she goes, I don't know why.  They just do that sometimes.  And I'm like, you fucking genderless fucking bag of shit.  Look into it.  Look into it.  That's the company line.  Don't lie to me.  I fly too much, you fucking pig. 
[03:16:00]  That's what bugs me.  Not when they make you stick because you're hitting turbulence.  Oh, listen, yeah.  I deal with plenty of pieces of shit.  Well, when they separate people based on race, I agree with that too.  All right.  Let's step aside.  I have to tinkle, Opie.  Yeah, that's why.  Can I just say one thing quickly?  Yes.  I was on a plane and there was a foreign flight attendant from Italy or something,  a really weird lady with a European accent.  And she said to this couple with kids, you have to separate.  There are rules about having too many children in one row because of how many masks there are. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, right.  Because you have to assist the...  Yeah.  So she says there are not enough masks for the children.  And so if there's a problem, that one child will not survive.  She told him that?  Wow, that is great.  That's wonderful.  Fuck you, lady.  I'll rip the oxygen mask off your face and put it on my own kids.  No kidding.  All right.  They wouldn't be pandemonium, but not survive.  Spanking kids next on the Opie and Anthony show.  It was with them that Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway. 
[03:17:00]  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, you were lucky, Louie.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  A little lower, Bill, will you?  Thanks.  Speaking of comedy, we were talking about comedy during the whole break. 
[03:17:30]  ONA Traveling Virus 2.  We're working on the details, man.  Pete sent me a bunch of possible dates.  Holy shit.  Fucking great.  They're motivated over at Pete's office.  Animals did.  I think they wanted to go on the road like 10 weeks.  Starting in April.  A little bit motivated.  I think they cut into my vacation.  Yeah, we had like a day.  We had to tell them to relax.  But they want to start this up in April.  We had a helicopter onto the ship, Anthony's vacationing on now. 
[03:18:00]  He's talking about stuff like that.  Look, we'll just get him off the ship for a day.  We'll get him back.  Yeah, there you go.  A helicopter to me.  You won't miss the buffet and the gambling.  No.  Who's on the virus tour?  Well, we're going to be asking you, Louie C.K., not to put you on the spot here.  And you'll be paid $500 per performance.  $500.  No, we wanted to bring some new names in this show.  Just to mix it up a little bit.  Have to have a little.  And then, of course, the regulars that you know and love from the show.  Yeah, Louie's been killing for us. 
[03:18:30]  We'd love to have you, Louie.  Well, I'd love to do it.  You don't have to say anything.  No, I'd love to.  Just keep it at that.  Okay.  You know, the business end will call you.  It's always fun.  That'll be up to you guys.  We hope we can work something out.  Yeah.  I hope you're ready for it.  No, I mean, I'm going on the road all year.  This year is a road year.  My wife and I made a deal that I'm going to go.  It's going to be two weeks off and one week off all year.  Does she want you gone or she wants you home?  She wants me gone and we need the money and I want to do another special this year, so  I'm building another hour.  Wait, two weeks on, one week off? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, so I'm going to be on the road like all year long.  How lucky are you?  I know.  I can't wait.  Don't have to deal with the screaming kids.  I can't wait.  Wow.  I go on the road well, too.  Like, I have the club pay.  Like, I have them pick me a really nice hotel, like the best one in town.  I don't.  They pay.  I pay for it.  But I have them take it out of my check.  And it's all fuck my wife stuff.  It's all.  When I go on the road, I stay out there fucking Ritz and it's like half my check, but fuck  her.  That's why.  So many things are motivated, I think, in the world by fuck my wife. 
[03:19:30]  I really think, like, there was a guy in Egypt and his wife, don't make pyramids, and  he's like, fuck you, I'm making them.  And that's where I swear that motivated that.  But no, I do.  I, yeah, I go nice on the road.  Yeah.  I pay.  It's not, nobody's, I'm not a star.  Nobody lets me have that.  They're not paying for it.  But my wife doesn't bother looking at the books and seeing she doesn't, you know.  You know.  It's a way to hide.  You've got to keep yourself rested and comfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah, but not at the Ritz.  I literally stay at the Ritz. 
[03:20:00]  Do you order home service?  That's, of course.  That's like the best.  I fucking, I rent a Jaguar.  What else in DC?  Come on.  No way.  I rent, I always rent a Jaguar if it's available.  Oh my God.  Just because I'm an asshole.  And then I fly first class and I stay at the Ritz.  It takes a huge amount of my check, but my wife doesn't, you know, because it's not  like it's coming off our visa bill.  I have the club pay for it, which is also bad for my taxes.  It's really dumb.  Yeah.  Because you could write all that shit off.  But it's because at home I got to fight for everything I want.  I have no fucking, there's no, I don't have like a proper office in our house. 
[03:20:30]  Like there's nothing that is, my comfort is the last priority of our family.  It's our kids, our, the poor tired mom who works so hard to raise the kids and I can  go fuck myself.  But on the road, I'm like, fuck everyone.  I am the president of the United States.  Jaguar and the Ritz in first.  Fuck you.  If there's no Ritz, I stay at the presidential suite at whatever fucking shithole I'm staying  at.  I'm such an asshole. 
[03:21:00]  That's wonderful.  The greatest.  Yeah, speaking of the ONA traveling virus, Vegas, West Palm Beach, these are just thoughts  so far.  Washington, D.C., Long Island, looks like possibly Jones Beach, Connecticut, hopefully the city  of Boston this time around instead of Worcester, Detroit, Chicago, Homedale, and Camden for  all the Philly folk.  Going back to Philly, huh?  We should punish them this year.  Let's skip them. 
[03:21:30]  I hope they're going to behave.  We'll have more details.  Fucking snipers up in the rafters.  Yeah.  Spanking of the kids.  Where are you staying?  We all got spanked growing up, right?  We all got hit.  I got spanked.  I got spanked on the front.  My dad would...  I can't even make the joke.  It was that awful?  It's that bad.  Yeah, my parents would...  He would hold your dick in his hand and slap it like that?  With his face.  I wasn't going to say that.  I was actually going to say...  I'm glad you did.  I had the image already, and then it went into motion. 
[03:22:00]  Like, it moved.  Why can't you make the joke?  My parents listen to the show sometimes, and there's certain things I just can't see.  Oh, they're starting.  They're starting to...  Oh, jeez.  They don't understand anything.  I do love my girlfriend, though.  She's so nice.  Oh, yeah.  We do a little trick.  She'll go to kiss my cheek, and I'll turn and plant one on her lips.  That's adorable.  But I do that right after I eat another girl's pussy.  Lucky Louie on DVD.  It's coming Tuesday. 
[03:22:30]  Kid order now.  Amazon.com.  I think growing up, if you're at a certain age, you got spanked.  That's, you know, it's just the way things were.  When did that end?  When did the time out start?  Louie, you had the kids.  I got kids, and we don't spank them.  I don't...  So you're like the barrier.  You're the generation that got spanked.  I know what it did to me.  I ain't going to do it to another kid.  It horrified me as a kid.  It did not help me at all.  I don't speak to my father.  No, it's one of those things that, like, they were bad spankings.  Well, there's a difference. 
[03:23:00]  I don't either.  Yeah.  I don't talk to my father.  No.  I've been dead 10 years.  Because I remember that.  Wait, Louie, you don't talk to your dad?  Well, no, we're starting to reconcile now because I'm finally beyond my problems.  So we're starting to be friends now, my dad.  Are you?  Yeah.  But for a lot of years, I didn't speak to him.  Yeah.  That's got to hurt.  I guess.  Well, you know, it's one of those family things.  You don't want shit getting in the way.  Well, it's like, I remember my dad.  He would lecture me first and tell me why he's going to, which is like torture. 
[03:23:30]  That's fucking A, man.  Here's why you're getting spanked.  And I remember standing there thinking, the instant I'm old enough, I'm getting the fuck  away from this man and never seeing him again.  My mother used to hit me, but with her, it was different because she was overworked.  She was a single.  My parents got divorced.  She's a single mom, tired.  Shut up.  Bang.  I totally relate to that.  If you're a parent and you're overwrought and you just out of frustration need to hit  your kid just to settle you, just to center yourself, I totally understand. 
[03:24:00]  Center yourself.  I understand.  I sympathize with it.  Yeah.  But the idea of hitting kids methodically as a way to discipline them, I just, I don't  think, I think it's wrong.  I don't think it's like morally wrong.  I just don't think it works.  I would get, it doesn't work.  I would get the strap.  The fucking belt would come off.  My dad had the belt.  He had the belt and he would like, one time I was walking my bike across the street and  we had hedges that were higher than I was and I decided I was just going to walk out 
[03:24:30]  in the street and not look for any cars coming or anything.  I don't know why I decided to do this.  I just walked my bike out in the middle of the street and a car, like jammed on the brakes.  He's yelling at me and my father was in the yard and saw this happen.  So he's like, what the fuck?  Grabs the belt and here's what he would do.  He would fold the belt up into two, you know, so you get that like nice loop.  Yeah.  And as he's hitting me, this reciting would happen with each whack. 
[03:25:00]  Why did you run out in the street when you, and I'm like, oh, could you leave out some  fucking adjectives?  Yeah.  Just got to get to the point.  Even more.  This is not four syllables in the.  Yeah.  The.  W.  H.  Y.  D.  I.  D.  Y.  O.  You're fucking dead.  You're spelling now.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  And it just was, it just got like fear and pain and you just didn't. 
[03:25:30]  Mistrust of your parents.  You don't think they left.  It didn't help.  It's pain before you can take that kind of pain.  Didn't help.  Yeah.  What kind of kid is supposed to take that kind of pain?  The ignorant shit I hate hearing is when people are like, well, my child mouthed off to me, and I slapped him in the mouth, and he never did it again.  Is that all that happened?  He never did it again?  He never did it again, and he's scarred.  It's like a kid isn't a product.  Like, hey, it worked. 
[03:26:00]  That's all I care about is the result was the kid wasn't nasty again.  Well, you could have gotten that respect by the fucking kid liking you as a person, or just fucking giving them some positive.  I mean, there's a million ways.  When you yell at your kid, it destroys them.  I mean, you don't need to fucking hit them, you know?  Yeah.  I just don't think it works.  The hitting thing was really weird.  I thought you'd be a hitter.  No, never.  I thought you'd be a spanker.  And also, to me, it's like fucking perverted.  It is like an S&M thing.  You're going to spank your kid's bare bottom while they're screaming? 
[03:26:30]  Pull your pants down.  Fucking sicko.  If you're doing that, and you don't have a boner, then I don't even understand what's going on.  Hey, Glenn from Connecticut.  Opie said there were bad spankings.  Does that imply that there are good spankings from your father?  I think there's...  I think you could go too far is what I'm saying.  I think there's a...  The whack on the ass with the open hand.  Not a fucking send him flying across the room thing, but just an attention getter.  Like a, hey, no. 
[03:27:00]  So, I think if a parent does that, and me, not being a parent, I'm talking to my ass here.  I don't know.  But I just seem like that's a little less destructive than the fucking ritualistic strap beating.  Which, by the way, it's funny you mention it.  My parents, too, got divorced.  And then my mother had to be the disciplinarian.  She tried it once.  Yeah.  And she tried the strap thing.  And we had bunk beds.  So, I went, like, rolling into the lower bunk bed.  And she tried getting in there, like, with the fucking sidearm pitch. 
[03:27:30]  Because she couldn't go overhand.  Right.  Because the top bunk was in the way.  The Louis Tiot.  Yeah.  Submarine pitch.  Nice.  I see the Red Sox hat.  I'm helping Louis today.  She went in with the side swing.  The tip of the...  And she didn't know to double over the strap or anything.  Nice.  The tip of the belt did a perfect fucking Cat-O-9 tails snap right on the tip of my dick.  Oh, nightmare.  I was screaming like I had been shot in the abdomen.  And my mother dropped the belt and just, oh, my gosh. 
[03:28:00]  She's crying.  She's grabbing ice.  She doesn't know...  Kissing it, making it better.  Yeah, well, that helped.  She's putting ice on it.  Sucking out the poison.  She said I wasn't hitting me with a cobra.  I was like, oh, make two X's.  There's no snake.  Just in case.  I wasn't sure what I picked up.  Was it my belt or a snake?  She put ice on.  She's crying and never fucking even...  Never hit me again.  That was it with the disciplining with hitting. 
[03:28:30]  No, and again, I understand.  If you're bringing your kid up in a tough situation and if a kid goes out and almost dies, you just  want to fucking get it in the head.  A quick message.  I understand it.  So I don't look down on parents to do it.  I understand it.  But people that are arrogant about it on mics, it works.  Yeah.  It worked on me.  I'm fine.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You're an idiot like the rest of us.  Your eyes don't even focus.  No.  And it's not working.  The world is a fucking mess.  It's fucked things up.  It's like if your refrigerator's making noise. 
[03:29:00]  I unplugged it.  The noise stopped.  Yeah, but now it don't work.  Your food's rotten.  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't make that noise.  I didn't hear a peep out of it all night.  Something stinks.  I got to jump in.  Tom in Tennessee.  Daughter enjoys to get spanked.  What's this about, Tom?  What's going on, boys?  Yeah.  I can't even spank my daughter.  She's four years old.  I can't even spank her anymore because she would start to do shit just for me to spank her.  And she likes to get spanked.  Holy fuck. 
[03:29:30]  Of course.  What a whore.  She wouldn't cry.  Yeah, she wouldn't cry.  She would just look back at me and just give me the fucking eyes.  See, that's the territory you're getting into.  Holy shit.  She's fucked up.  She's fucked up, yeah.  It is.  Wow, I've never fucking heard of that.  That is not right.  There's a guy in her future that's going to be real happy.  Oh, yeah.  No, my daughter likes getting timeouts.  She likes, she has to sit in the corner with, like, face in the wall.  Yeah.  She, she'll do something and then go, do I need a timeout?  She gets off on it.  She likes it. 
[03:30:00]  Wow, that's like some kind of discipline thing, maybe some time alone.  Do you watch any of those nanny shows?  No.  Nanny 911 or something?  I got enough fucking time.  Yeah, I realize.  The idea of watching somebody else having a problem with a kid.  Fucking, I'd rather.  Let me give you a little insight.  Then, yeah, I'll give you a little insight on single guy with no kids.  Yeah.  You know, I got a girlfriend, but, you know, no kids.  Those shows fascinate me.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:30:30]  Because it is a fucking madhouse at the beginning.  Kids running, spitting at their parents, cursing, ripping hair out of the siblings' heads.  And then they're smacking them around.  And then this nanny comes in and makes a little timeout area and it takes time.  She gets down on the level of the child, like on, takes a knee and explains to the child what the problem is.  And then by the end of the show, there are these little angels that put their clothes away.  And then what you find out is that the parents aren't doing anything. 
[03:31:00]  Right.  Most parents don't do anything.  That's usually what it is.  They don't put any thought.  They just live with these kids like they're roommates.  Yep.  They let them watch television, which just makes your kid into a fucking idiot.  And puts the, TV is a level of stimulus that nothing can compete with.  Louie, it's all I fucking did as a child.  I know, me too.  Me too.  Was sit in front of the TV.  Pump them full of fucking MSG and sugar, which all food is.  Same thing.  And give them television to watch, which sends them into this fucked up state in their minds.  And then they get, the kids don't have a regulatory system. 
[03:31:30]  No.  They just, they get agitated.  They do, they don't know how to stop themselves from doing something.  So these parents, like, let the fucking TV raise them.  Give them bad food without even thinking about it.  Don't give them any fruit or actually fucking any nutrition.  Yeah.  Then the kid goes, ah, and then they hit them.  I mean, it's, it's turning.  It's why the whole, and people are like, well, it works.  No, it doesn't.  The country's going to shit.  Yeah.  It's fucking crime and drug.  That's where drug addiction comes from.  Interracial relationships.  What's that?  Interracial relationships.  Interracial relationships, which is a huge problem. 
[03:32:00]  Bring, you know, a girl gets hit enough times and doesn't want her.  She's bringing one of them home.  That's right.  Dark, dark, and a pink hat.  Oh, I'll show you in the end.  Makes up for every fucking beating the father ever gave.  Ever, ever, ever.  Hey, pops.  Want to introduce you to Tyrone.  Hit me now.  Holy fuck.  Hit me now.  Andy from Chicago.  Andy.  How's it going, fellas?  Hey, Andy.  It's spreading out here, so keep it up.  Yeah, growing up, we lived on a little cul-de-sac, and not only did I get everything on my  ass from a wooden spoon, like the cake mixing spoons and ping pong paddles and studded belts, 
[03:32:30]  but it was pretty much the norm.  If I was acting up and my folks weren't around, my neighbors could take care of it.  It pretty much got to the point where if the neighbor was having a bad day and I was acting  out of it in any way, they could pretty much take it out on me.  Oh, permission to hit you by a neighbor.  That's nice, too.  Not just hit, man.  One time, we had a little crick by my house, and the guy, the neighbor had me over his  head.  What is Mark Twain's character this guy is?  At a crick.  I don't know.  What about the crick?  How did he discipline you, sir?  Did nigger Jim hit you? 
[03:33:00]  With a radio?  Hey, man.  He had me over his head.  He's like, I'm throwing you in.  I'm throwing you in.  I'm like, no, you're not.  You're a liar.  He drops me and kicks me with steel-toed boots in the ass for calling him a liar at  five years old.  And not only did I get a boot in the ass, but then he tells my mom that I called him  a liar, so I had to do that, wait for daddy to get home.  Oh, great.  You get hit.  That was another thing.  Yeah, wait until your father gets home.  And now you've got to sit like fucking the Green Mile.  You're just waiting to get fucking bludgeoned. 
[03:33:30]  That's the worst part.  I remember when I was a kid once.  Psychological damage.  My mother gave me $5 to go to the market to buy some stuff for the family, and I was  walking around with my friends just playing and not going to the store, and then I'm walking  down.  Little Louie fucked up.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  And I'm walking through this little alley behind the stores that we used to fuck around in,  and I found $5.  And in my insides, I knew it was my $5 that I had dropped and then found, but I didn't  go in that pocket because I didn't want to believe it. 
[03:34:00]  I wanted to believe that I found $5.  And I bought ice cream, and I bought the Guinness Book of World Records.  I remember it was a big deal to me that I bought that.  Of course.  I'm a nerd.  Yeah.  It was a big book when we were kids.  17.  Yeah, I was 23.  And I went home, and I told my mother, look at this stuff I got.  And she said, where's the food that you're supposed to buy?  Oh, my God.  I lost the $5.  How did you even think that would pan out for you?  So she sent me to my room, and then when my father came home, she told him the story. 
[03:34:30]  I could hear them talking, and they're laughing about the story.  Of course.  They just think it's hilarious.  So I'm like, I have to be off the hook.  But they laughed at my story, and then he beat the shit out of me.  Oh, shit.  Which is the worst.  I mean, it's seared in my memory.  I remember every moment of it.  Look, it's right there now.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Let's go to the story here.  Should spanking under three be illegal?  Parents could soon find themselves in timeout for spanking their kids.  A California Assemblywoman is proposing a ban on spanking children younger than three. 
[03:35:00]  If that bill passes, hitting your toddler would be a misdemeanor offense, landing you actually  behind bars, or with a $1,000 fine.  MSNBC legal expert Susan Filan joins me.  Now, Susan, this is a fun one.  What?  What do trial abuse laws cover?  Abuse.  Abuse, neglect, beating, cruelty, endangerment, spanking.  But here's the problem with this legislation.  What's a spank?  Is it a tap?  Is it a love tap? 
[03:35:30]  Is it a smack?  Is it a punt?  And who decides that?  Exactly.  Exactly.  And now we're going to start telling parents how to really parent their children.  Why don't we now have a bill you didn't love your child enough?  You didn't nurture your child enough.  You know, you're overly critical of that art project.  It is a slippery slope.  As we're both parents, so we can both really feel this one deeply and personally.  I hate that slippery slope.  I do, too.  No, you make stuff.  You have to.  It's slippery.  Everything's a slippery slope.  Everything's a slippery slope. 
[03:36:00]  Yes, exactly.  Even a fucking, even a well-adhered slope is slippery.  Yeah?  You don't want to stand on that stable ground because it's a slippery slope.  Slope has been salted and still people are bitching about it.  Well, they ask, how could this even be enforced?  That's the question.  What judge is going to believe a two-year-old?  Experts say, and I think this is pretty true, spanking usually happens in the home.  Experts.  So how would this even be enforced from a legal standpoint?  Oh, my gosh.  Can you imagine now parents bickering?  I'm calling the cops so near for spanking the child. 
[03:36:30]  I mean, it's just a really, really bad idea.  It's an impossible bill to enforce.  It's going to be impossible to define.  It's going to be impossible to determine appropriate punishment.  Who gets a year?  Oh, that was a really bad spank.  You get six months because that wasn't the worst spank I've ever seen.  I mean, I just, for me, it's like how this differs from, I mean, child abuse is important  to have laws in the book to protect things, leave a mark, et cetera, et cetera.  There's an easy way to say abuse happened here, physical abuse happened, and you need  to be punished. 
[03:37:00]  This is a slippery slope in a gray area in the law.  That said, what do you think the chances are of this passing?  Zero?  I mean, I just think it's stupid.  I just, well, you're stupid.  Then why are you guys talking about it?  Exactly.  I don't think they should pass a law like that.  No, no law.  It's just fucking...  People shouldn't have common sense to do it, but, you know, they shouldn't pass it.  And California doesn't give a shit about kids.  No.  That's the meanest state in the world.  They care about themselves.  They care about themselves, right?  Yeah, no, I mean, I did a benefit for this place that was a foster home for kids that 
[03:37:30]  are like, kids that were left in cars by the highway because they had terminal, kids that  have terminal diseases in poor neighborhoods, they get fucking left just on the highway  all the time.  So this was a foster home for them.  And California, the state of California closed it because they didn't like the statistics.  The foster homes is where they get the statistics of how many kids are endangered.  And the statistics were getting too high in California.  Makes the state look bad.  So they just closed the home.  Closed it down.  They won't count them.  No way to count them.  And we look better. 
[03:38:00]  It's awful.  Do you read the fucking Grapes of Wrath?  It's an awful place.  No.  It's a cruel state.  So they're hypocrites.  I think what we need to be aware of is if you see a kid in a grocery store whose parent  or caregiver is whacking them, you know, pants down with a hairbrush on a bare bottom.  Hold on a second.  Get that camera phone out.  Who the fuck has seen that?  YouTube.  Another fucking Bill Donahue type.  Yeah, no kidding.  Oh.  What if a child is blowing Martin Luther King?  And being spanked for it. 
[03:38:30]  You can be spanked for that, sure.  ...store whose parent or caregiver is whacking them, you know, pants down with a hairbrush  on a bare bottom.  You call the police.  I don't think anyone's going to call that a spank.  And I think that's what we're talking about.  I think we're talking about egregious.  You're talking about abuse.  Disappointment of children.  Abuse, right.  But a parent, a love tap, a little smack, a wake-up smack, whatever you want to call it.  Wake-up smack.  Wake-up smack.  I used to do that every morning.  And under three, sometimes they don't get the verbal cues. 
[03:39:00]  So that is what they're targeting.  Oh, interesting.  Anybody out there with a two-year-old?  Yeah, exactly.  So this is dumb.  Okay.  I mean, really.  We need serious laws.  And we need real police enforcement.  Anybody under three will be really funny.  Aren't we all talking about showing that and then putting our resources toward that.  Sexual predators, people who molest children.  I mean, that's where we should be putting our resources.  Spanking.  Oh, please.  Spanking molesters?  What?  But again, it's like these people that are like, you know, should we be watering our lawns 
[03:39:30]  in the summer?  I don't know.  But what about people blowing children and Martin Luther King?  I was talking about something completely different.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We got another great story.  Lee in Indiana.  Lee, it's your turn on the Open Anthony Show.  What's up, Lee?  How you guys doing this morning?  All right.  Yeah, when I was a kid, my stepmom used to use what they call bed slats.  The one-by-twos they used to put underneath the mattress.  Yeah.  Oh, those things.  Bed slats.  Oh, shit.  That's fucking like in the hole beating. 
[03:40:00]  That's like fucking when you're in the hole in jail.  In prison.  Oh, it was the worst.  And she beat me one time so bad, she almost broke my arm, so I called the cops.  And the cops come out there and showed her a special hole to put on my neck to make me  pass out.  And they said, if he ever gives you that kind of problem again, just squeeze his neck  right here.  He'll go down like a brick, you know, like a bag of bricks.  Who are you, Radio Raheem?  Indiana.  I got it.  Wow.  Hey, I was up in Chicago seeing you guys' billboard up there yesterday. 
[03:40:30]  And I don't know what they did to your face, Anthony, but it looks like you're just one  false sword of a rubber helmet, man.  I mean, they got that thing so distorted up there, no wonder nobody listens up there in  Chicago.  They distorted your face on the...  Oh, no, it's just the way I really look.  You know he could have been a model, right?  He could have been a model.  You know what else is really bad when you're a kid?  I used to get hit with different objects if something wasn't readily available.  And one thing was when they hit you with your fucking toys that you... 
[03:41:00]  Like, then that toy all of a sudden is not fun for you anymore.  You would lose that toy immediately.  I got beat with a Hot Wheels track.  Fucking hot with those orange Hot Wheels track are custom made for beating children with.  Yeah.  And I got a smack on the ass with it.  And then you're playing with your Hot Wheels and just getting anxiety and not knowing why.  Right.  You know, kids also, you're teaching them to use it against each other.  Like, if you have siblings...  Yeah.  ...the parent who hits becomes like this justice system... 
[03:41:30]  Right.  ...that you learn how to subvert and use against you.  Now I will use this.  Yeah.  Like, there was a little kid across the street from me when I was growing up named Benji,  and I didn't really like him, but I got threw in with him because we're the same age.  So our parents, oh, go play with Benji.  So I was over there, and he was just...  I started poking him with a stick, just being an asshole to him.  And he was going, stop it!  And I just kept poking him, and then he hit me.  And his father saw it throughout the window.  And his father came running out and beat the shit.  I just spanked the living shit out of him.  Wow.  And I was thrilled at that cause and effect. 
[03:42:00]  Just watching that, yeah.  So the next day I went over and I started poking him.  And he's trying to resist because he doesn't want to get hit, and I just kept bothering him.  And then he hit me, and the father came out and beat him up again.  And I was like, this is awesome.  This is so good.  That's what I was taught by spanking.  Yeah, see?  And he was taught, and it was unfair to him.  Oh.  Now Benji's in a bathhouse right now, probably voluntarily being tied up and fucked in the mouth.  Thanks to you and your stick. 
[03:42:30]  Hey, Mr. Torrance, for Mincent Feedback, my father went to the WWF School of Parenting.  He would just grab random objects nearby to beat me with.  He once broke a shelf over my head, and I remember thinking, I built that in shop class, you asshole.  The things that go through your head.  I was blaming things on animals and stuff.  Like, I used to take things apart.  I would love just disassembling stuff, but I was a kid, so I never knew how to put it back together.  You could just take things apart.  And my parents had a nice clock, and I just wanted to know how it worked. 
[03:43:00]  So you never think you're going to take the whole goddamn thing apart.  Of course I took it apart.  You just want to kind of look at the insides, and then something goes boing.  Yeah, and it's over.  And it's just gone, and it was apart.  So I laid it out on the floor, and I took the dog, we had a dog, and I took his paws, put him up on the table that the clock was on, and scraped with his nails into the table.  Like, I'm setting up the perfect crime here, and left it like that. 
[03:43:30]  And it would have been better if I said I did it, because I had to watch my father beat the shit out of our dog.  This poor animal's going, and I'm like, oh my god, I just fucking condemned that dog, that innocent dog, to this beating that he's getting.  No, but that's the thing.  That's what beating your kids, because a kid can't face a beating.  Right.  It's too awful for a kid.  That's what I was doing, I couldn't take the beating.  So that's what you turn kids into liars, and I am a liar my whole life. 
[03:44:00]  I'm a dishonest person, because I couldn't face negativity.  I couldn't face making a mistake.  This is like therapy.  Yeah.  I'm getting a therapy session.  But that's what, if you hit your kid, people, he never did that again.  Yeah, he did.  He just got good at hiding it, you fucking faggot.  You know what would be really funny, if you have to see that with a clock, if your dad fucked the dog in front of you?  That was the punishment for the dog.  And it died.  He fucked it to death. 
[03:44:30]  How do you know that isn't just the part I left out, Jimmy?  We got another great time.  Dad, fuck that dog.  We got another real good one coming in here.  Justin from Oklahoma.  Justin.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Justin.  Hey, listen.  Whenever, I used to go stay with my dad in the summertime, so I hated going, because my stepmom used to beat the shit out of me.  But I always had a hard time going to sleep, because I was always homesick from my mom.  And he would tell me that the little black boys would come around and come in my room and wake me up if I did not go to sleep at the time I was supposed to go to sleep. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, my God.  How much pressure is that?  Yeah, I remember that one, too.  Did it ever happen?  My favorite movie now is my girlfriend is black.  That's cool.  And your favorite movie is Ghost.  My favorite movie is Ghost.  Did that ever happen?  Did any black boys come in your room and...  Now that I ever knew, I fucking went to sleep.  Sure.  Me and my brother, you know, we used to talk.  We had bunk beds.  We shared a room.  So we would talk.  And we lived in a real small shithole apartment where our bedroom was right off the living room. 
[03:45:30]  So my father and mother would just be miserable on opposite sides of the couch watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Trying to get a laugh in their lives.  And my mother looking snidely over my father every time he'd laugh because it implied he was enjoying himself.  And that just pissed my mother off that he was having fun.  Just the hatred between the two of them.  Totally.  And me and my brother would sit there and just, like, we would be on bunk beds in the bedroom.  But they could hear us.  And we'd be just whispering to each other. 
[03:46:00]  Anything like, Jay, did you see the commercial for the new Hot Wheels and stuff?  It's so cool.  We just want to get inside.  And we'd hear from inside, hey, knock it off in there and get to sleep.  If you're not to sleep in 15 minutes, I'll come in there.  And then you're sitting there going, oh, my God, my body has to fall asleep.  Or he's going to knock.  No, I'm not asleep.  How much pressure is that on a kid to sleep?  I know.  And then we couldn't talk.  So we could even lower.  We weren't just kids trying to enjoy each other's company.  And he would come over and hang the belt on the doorknob. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, Jesus.  And it would, like, swing.  The light would glisten off the buckle.  Like, I remember this vividly.  Like, that belt would be the warning.  That's going to make you sleep.  And you'd stare at the belt and be, I've got eight minutes left.  Holy shit.  He's going to know I can't fake it.  I can't shut my eyes.  I'm not a fucking actor.  I can't shut my eyes and make believe I'm asleep.  He could tell I'm not asleep.  It was just frightening.  What would have happened if, like, after you went back in the living room, if you opened  the door and took the belt and threw it back down the hall and go, you forgot your belt, 
[03:47:00]  stupid.  That would have been awesome.  Oh, and I would have loved to have been able to do something like that.  Like, plank it on the floor after you threw it.  He wouldn't be here today, man.  And, you know, let me tell you something.  I don't know what effect this had, but when they would go out or leave the house and a  babysitter would come over or something like that, me and my brother would break into  the fucking liquor cabinet and start drinking.  At what age?  We were drinking.  What age? 
[03:47:30]  I had to be fucking eight.  Holy shit.  And maybe my brother was nine.  And my brother would start fucking making out with the babysitters.  Right.  They were like 15 years old, 16 years old babysitters.  No, that's what happens.  Yeah.  You just lose fucking control and say, fuck you.  I'm doing it.  When my parents went, Mike, because my dad left the house and then my mother would work  and I used to go home.  I used to leave school in the middle of the day all the time.  Just leave.  And I'd go home and I'm just leaving.  Yeah.  I'd just buy. 
[03:48:00]  And I was like a feral cat in the house.  Rubbing my dick against every surface in the house.  Fucking, you know, just disgusting.  I used to climb.  We had an upstairs neighbor's because we lived in a two family house.  And I used to go through the basement, go into their apartment and steal shit.  But I became a fucking mess.  It really worked.  It worked well, that spanking thing, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  I've always kind of been an advocate, too, of the spanking.  But now that I look back, it might not have worked.  Because Louie brought up a great point where it's like, hey, it worked. 
[03:48:30]  But you just don't know what else it's doing.  That's a huge problem.  It's so...  It's teaching your kid that hitting is how you get stuff.  I mean, that's how, you know, that you listen to people who hit you.  What kind of fucking life lesson is that?  Well, if someone hits you, just listen to him.  Yeah, just do whatever they said right before you.  Or he'll keep hitting you.  Yeah.  It's bad in raising a kid, although I do think on, like, places where it should be yanked  at it, like if a kid's crying on a plane.  If he's not used to being hit, and all of a sudden you're hammerfisting him. 
[03:49:00]  Now, I think an attention-getting whack on the ass is kind of an attention-getter thing.  I mean, I wouldn't do anything about my...  I mean, I can't imagine...  Fucking, the kids are so tiny.  It's just bizarre to me.  Pick them up by the arm.  But look, I don't believe in hitting my dog.  I don't believe in it.  But my dog once snapped at my daughter, and I fucking laid her out.  And I felt bad, and I don't think it was...  Did you get a good...  ...out of it?  It was pretty good.  Oh, they get surprised when you hit them.  I smacked her in the face.  Hard?  Yeah.  I threw her outside, I dragged her outside, and as I closed the door on her, I gave her 
[03:49:30]  a fucking nasty whack in the face.  Do you think the dog knew why?  It was just snapping?  I didn't matter.  Didn't even care.  It was retribution.  It wasn't fucking rehabilitation.  It was just rehabilitation.  It was just rehabilitation.  Yeah.  Dog behaved after that, though, right?  Well, yeah, but with the dog especially, actually hitting dogs is a plain bad idea,  because they do get aggressive, and they don't...  It confuses them.  Yeah, they don't...  Because they don't hit each other.  Dog.  Yeah.  Why don't we go to Jason in Wyoming?  Well, they do lick each other's assholes.  It doesn't mean we should have to interact like they should. 
[03:50:00]  No.  Right, right, no.  We should, perhaps.  If he doesn't bite the dog...  When my dog was a puppy, I did bite her on the ear, which I heard is a good...  Like, I laid down flat on top of her and bit her on the ear.  Did the alpha male thing?  Yeah.  And it worked.  She sat and pissed on it.  Just pissed in her face.  Piss in its favorite corner.  Showing who's boss.  Hey, this has come in a couple times as well.  Jason in Wyoming, here's another angle.  Jason, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys got me reminiscing about the, God damn it, if I gotta come in there.  Yeah.  But, you know, my dad used to give me a tune-up. 
[03:50:30]  If I was being good for an extended period of time, he'd whack me in the back of the head  to remind me of what would happen if I was naughty.  Wow.  This came in a few times.  People that, they were too good for too long and the father felt like they gotta hit him  anyway.  That's a good one.  Oh yeah, you gotta get a tune-up.  Just to keep him going, I guess.  No, I think you tapped into something when you said that your father's laughing at laughing  and his wife is sneering at him.  That's why he's yelling at you.  They were, of course, they were miserable. 
[03:51:00]  No, there's nothing, that is the trait of a miserable marriage and I've been there, that  your wife does not want you to be, which is again why I stay at the Ritz on the road.  Because, like, if my wife calls me at work, like, I'm working on a comedy show.  Right.  And everybody's in my office and we're laughing about something and she calls on my phone and  she's, oh, what, do you just sit around and laugh all day?  Yeah.  Is that what you're doing while I'm home with the kids?  You're sitting there and laughing?  She's angry.  So when people call me on my phone at work when I'm on a show, I have to go, shh, like 
[03:51:30]  it's, I'm smoking pot and my mom's calling.  No fun in the air.  Yeah, yeah, no.  No fun.  Everybody get out.  Hi, no, we're just working really hard on the comedy.  It's just miserable.  I was married for nine years and Opie remembers, I would love doing the show and then we used  to carpool because we lived in the same town.  So he'd be driving me home and, like, he could see the point where he'd make a corner and, 
[03:52:00]  like, the fun and vibrant life I had would be sucked from my body.  My shoulders went down.  Like, we're talking, yeah, we'd be talking about that day's show and what we're going  to do tomorrow and just our career and how excited we are about being in New York and  and then we'd turn a corner and my shoulders would slump, my jaw would kind of go down,  my eyes would kind of get, like, down and she'd be at the door kind of looking out the  door and I'd be walking toward the door and Opie would hear some shit like, like, the garbage 
[03:52:30]  was supposed to be at the curb this morning and he'd drive away just, and I'm a beaten man.  Well, the vacuum cleaner is the story we always tell.  Oh, yeah, when he comes to pick me up.  Anthony's not a morning person and I used to pick him up around 10, 10.30, whatever.  But the point of the story, Ant was awake maybe five minutes because he would wake, get in  the car and try to wake up, you know, for the ride.  All psyched to come in because it's a fucking fun job.  Sure.  So I pulled up one day and there's, like, this huge argument going on on the stoop and 
[03:53:00]  I'm thinking to myself, I know he gets up real, just in time to jump in the car.  What could he have possibly done wrong?  He's been awake maybe ten minutes.  And she was yelling and screaming because he didn't vacuum before he left the house.  Because vacuuming was my responsibility.  To do our shock jock radio show.  Vacuuming was my responsibility.  And another thing, as you brought it up, there were a couple times I was ready to drop him  back off at the house and I would actually go, you want to go around the block?  What do you want to do?  You don't want to go home. 
[03:53:30]  So I would, like, I would drive past the house just so he could get, I don't know, psyched  or just get himself together.  No, my wife, we had one of those ridiculous garbage arguments because she came in the  kitchen and said, how come the garbage isn't out in the bin?  It's sitting on the kitchen floor.  And I go, the bin is full.  And she goes, really?  It's full?  And I'm like, I have to breathe to not get my, oh no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's full.  And she goes, so even a bag wouldn't fit in there.  And I'm like, why don't you go outside and look? 
[03:54:00]  Why don't you go look in the bin?  And I'm saying it with, like, a tight smile.  Why don't you go look in the bin?  And she's like, why are you being shitty?  I'm only asking you if it's full.  No, you're not just asking.  You're asking three times regardless of my answer.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  I've answered you.  Yeah.  You asked again and again.  Yeah, and then so I start talking like that.  Like, I'm going, you asked again and again.  And I told you it was.  And then she goes, look at you.  Look at yourself. 
[03:54:30]  Look how you're talking.  Oh, women are awful.  She's like Perry Mason.  Yeah.  Like, trying to trip you up on your testimony.  And then finally you lost, you were the guy that went, all right, all right.  And see the temper, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  See, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  Yeah, but here's how fucked up things are.  The bin was not full.  It was.  And I am mad at her because how would she know I'm lying?  Like, I'm mad at her.  Right.  I'm mad.  I'm indignant that she's calling me a liar simply because I know she has no reason to  doubt me.  She would have had to have looked.  But it was not full.  Did she check the bin? 
[03:55:00]  What's that?  Did she check the bin?  She would have had to have looked into the bin.  She didn't do anything.  No, she didn't.  She didn't look.  She did not look.  Then how did she know it wasn't full?  No, she just doesn't trust me.  Just because she knew you're a liar.  See, I'm angry that she doesn't trust me even though the fact is I'm lying.  You shouldn't be trusted.  It's true.  I love it.  Let's get a hot story on the air here.  It's Michelle in Jersey.  Michelle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, I just wanted to relate to Anthony.  My dad used to do the same thing.  Me and my sister would share a room.  Late at night, he would turn the TV down so he could hear us talk. 
[03:55:30]  A bunch of little girls would cheer shatter.  He would come with a belt and then beat us.  He would just say some things like he'd beat us in syllables or what have you.  We would have to laugh at him for what he tripped up with.  Then he would hit us somewhere for that.  It was ridiculous.  It was relentless.  You laughed?  Yeah, he would laugh.  We had to laugh because he was tripping up.  He would say stuff that didn't make any sense because I don't know why.  Oh, because he was just doing it in syllables and got all mixed up. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, that syllable beating is the worst for a kid.  You're just like, oh, my God, where is he going with this story?  How long is it going to go?  When does this wrap up?  Jesus.  And it was teaching us a lesson.  Meanwhile, it was because he was miserable.  Why do you punch it in a little bit and punch it out, guys?  They're all talking about the Dakota fan.  Oh, now they got a little clips of the movie?  Oh, boy.  Well, look how cute she is.  Some critics are saying it wasn't graphic enough. 
[03:56:30]  Pedophiles are coming out.  D.A. says film crew did not commit a crime.  Look at this guy.  Oh, he looks like...  Investigate him.  It's a clean-shaven Bill.  He's a talk show host?  I think it's from Air America.  I think it's from Air America.  Fucking Air.  Ben Ferguson.  Or Radio America.  Is that different than Air America?  Yeah.  I think that's...  He looks like the conservative.  Ben Ferguson tells me this guy was first online with a handful of tickets.  Yeah.  No kidding.  These people are causing the problem.  Because it's a movie about where there's a child rape, like we were saying, in the context 
[03:57:00]  of a story.  Right.  It's probably dealt with very tastefully and artistically.  It's supposed to be hard.  But these people are removing it and just showing her picture and saying, raped, on  camera.  Rape.  And just turning it into...  This big thing.  They're distilling it down to an ugly thing.  And so that kids are going to see...  Kids aren't going to see that movie.  No.  Because it's a piece of shit Sundance art.  Fuck.  Right.  Artsy-farsy movie.  But they are watching CNN over their parents' shoulders seeing a little girl's face and it  says, rape.  And they show her when she's like eight. 
[03:57:30]  Not that 12 is anything like that.  But at 12 or 13 years old that she is now, it's a lot different than the pictures they're  showing her smiling with her missing teeth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rape.  Yeah.  It's a movie.  She's a fucking actress.  Let's go to John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got a price this one on this.  I swear to God, this is true.  And before my father died, he admitted to my wife so I had a witness that he did this.  When I was a kid, he was too lazy to get up off the couch and spank me. 
[03:58:00]  So one day, he was a World War II buff.  So one day, he pulled off this book from the bookshelf and he said, come here, boy, I want  to show you something.  And he opened it up and he shows me Auschwitz and all the bodies and all the ovens and all  this stuff and explained to me what it was.  And then he showed me all these kids and they experimented on.  And then he puts it to the stage and he says, this guy here, his name is Heinrich Himmler.  And he was the head Nazi that was in charge of all this.  And he lives at, you know, that German restaurant on the main road we go to eat?  I said, yes, he lives in that basement. 
[03:58:30]  He said, I got his number.  And anytime you're bad, all I got to do is call him and he will take you away and put  you there.  Wow.  Your father threatened to send you to the Nazis?  So that's what happened to Himmler.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He ended up in a restaurant?  And how many...  But the killer part, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the killer part is, then they would take  us to eat at this restaurant and wonder why...  Great schnitzel.  What are you going to do?  I don't care if Heinrich Himmler is in the fucking basement.  The fucking pigs be to Rossum.  We had Mengele's soup recipes. 
[03:59:00]  John, what would you wonder when you were in the restaurant?  I was freaking because I just knew he was...  And my father would nudge me and go, hey, boy, he's in the basement.  You best be good.  And I would just freak the hell out.  John, how many...  He shared the pitch of fish.  How many hookers have you strangled?  Wow.  I quit doing that a couple of years ago when I got married.  There you go.  I'm okay now.  Thanks, John, for the story.  Let's go to Tom in New York.  Tom?  Morning.  Hey.  Yeah, my stepfather and his brother came from Europe in the 60s, and they had this real 
[03:59:30]  strict disciplinarian streak.  And we were over at their house one time visiting my cousins.  The youngest boy did something bad.  All four kids had to drop their drawers and bend over the bathtub and get spanked with the  belt like Anthony's father.  And I'm 12 years old watching a 15, a 14, and a 13-year-old girl bent over the bathtub getting  her ass spanked.  Wow.  That's completely hot.  That would cost a lot of money now.  Yep.  You can see that.  And you've got to fly all the way to Thailand. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And sit next to John.  Or is it Jeff?  We don't know.  Either one.  All right.  This is getting depressing.  The voices are changing on the phones.  Yeah, everybody's kind of like...  Yeah, people are thinking about it too much.  It was...  Whoa.  I remember it was 1973, and it was an early morning.  There was a mist in the backyard.  Everyone's got these vivid memories now.  We're supposed to be having fun here for these people.  It's like the way people describe 9-11.  Yeah.  It was a cold, crisp morning.  I remember where I was. 
[04:00:30]  September.  It was...  The sun was shining.  The sky was so blue.  It was unusually sunny.  It was the last thing you expected.  It was such a horrific day.  Right.  All right.  Time for the line of the day.  We got three runner-ups.  Three runners-up?  That's correct.  Oh, my God, Dan.  I say wow.  I say runners-up.  It's like brothers-in-law, brother-in-laws.  What is it, though?  Is it three runner-ups?  I don't know.  It should be runners-up, I think.  I don't know.  But not at all, but then again, a runner-up, a runner-up is one thing.  So runner-ups, it's like pluralizing runner-up. 
[04:01:00]  You're not pluralizing the up.  You're pluralizing the runners.  Runners.  All right.  It's like a turner's up.  Like attorneys general.  Exactly.  No, but it's different.  I suck at plural.  Dan, pants down.  You're being spanked.  You fucked with Jimmy.  Yes.  I don't know if he's right or wrong.  But you said it right.  You said it.  But now I'm thinking like, but it's not like brother...  If you have more than one sister-in-law...  Yeah, I know.  If you have more than one sister-in-law, it's not sister-in-laws.  It's sisters-in-law.  Yes.  Now, runner-ups, your argument, Dan, is that you're pluralizing the ups. 
[04:01:30]  You're not.  It's one word.  It's kind of runner-up.  Yeah, because...  You're the runner-up, so runner-ups.  Because you're not saying one runner.  And it's what?  It's a runner-up.  I think runner-ups is actually correct.  One is runner-up.  What are you saying?  It's not one word.  It's two words.  It looks official.  Runners-up.  I think it's runners-up.  Is that Webster's?  It was BBC.  Now, BBC is C.  They stink.  Fucking England.  They say schedule, you ass.  Exactly. 
[04:02:00]  Shut up.  And tomato.  Don't be honest.  Every time I listen to BBC Radio, at some point, genocide.  Genocide.  The small African nation.  The genocide.  The genocide.  Getting us all in trouble.  Both, right?  No.  No?  No?  Than?  According to dictionary.com, is that a reputable method?  It's just runners-up.  Runners-up.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'll suck your dick later.  What the fuck do you want from me?  Dealing's fair.  Son of a bitch.  Runners-up.  Runners-up.  He's always right.  All right.  Here's the first.  Never go against Than. 
[04:02:30]  Nope.  Here's the first runner-up.  Give a man a sandwich he eats for one day.  Teach a man to fish for sandwich, and he'll starve.  Because that's a problem.  Or poison his sandwich, and he'll never bug you again.  Hey, that's a combo platter, right?  A nice, clean, funny line of the day.  No cunts, nothing.  Yeah, I know, right?  It was completely acceptable.  That was funny.  Wow.  Nothing but cleverness.  Bodogfight.com sponsors line of the day. 
[04:03:00]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I don't even realize a kid was crying.  I swear to God, like, someone would go, why is that kid crying?  And I realize, oh, I'm fingering it.  And the other end of the spectrum.  There you go.  It is so filthy.  I'm surprised Al didn't dub that.  Go to Bodogfight.com.  Wait for a second, wait a minute, where the fuck were we?  And check out what they're about, please.  Bodogfight.com.  The final runner-up line of the day.  I got someone who needs me. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  She's not white.  No.  No.  She's not white.  No, only the whip can get a sound like that.  Louie C.K.  Lucky Louie on DVD this coming Tuesday.  January 30th.  That's a goddamn good line.  Order now on Amazon.com.  Only the whip can get a sound like that.  Jesus.  That's the most brutal thing said today.  That really is horrid.  And it was clean enough for fucking, for Ed Sullivan. 
[04:04:00]  Most brutal thing said today.  And we went through an hour of beating stories.  Yeah, right.  And a psychological effect.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Here's today's line of the day, courtesy of Bodogfight.com.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Every movie that comes down the pike that slams the Catholic Church, 
[04:04:30]  you like.  There's no question about it.  No, that's not true.  No, that's not true.  And you also like that.  You don't know what I like.  Well, I certainly do.  I know you like this movie.  He likes men.  No, you don't.  I didn't see the movie, you blockhead.  I didn't see it.  I'm not even interested in it.  Let me see.  Yeah, the blockhead line.  You blockhead.  Yeah, you blockhead.  You wanted to call him a cunt so bad. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, did you?  I was so close to saying cunt, so he would hear it, and America wouldn't.  Yeah.  What comes after blockhead?  You just go, fat?  All right.  Louie, thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  Of course, lucky Louie on DVD coming Tuesday.  Buy it.  Maybe they'll bring the show back if you buy it.  Please buy it.  I cannot wait until you come on the show and bomb one day.  It'll happen.  I'm waiting for it.  It will happen.  I'm like, God, and we'll enjoy it.  Another one.  Bat in a thousand, you bastard. 
[04:05:30]  Because we're asses.  Hey, failure is comedy.  That's what it's about.  Hey, uh...  You'll be like, I was sick today.  I didn't feel good.  I'm really sorry.  I hope you guys have me back.  I was off.  O&H on Virus, we mentioned that earlier.  Cleveland's bitching already, because we didn't announce a Cleveland date.  Oh, okay.  And Buffalo's bitching.  Buffalo should absolutely be included.  Buffalo has...  Yeah, they gave us great numbers, man.  Absolutely.  Buffalo has a really interesting situation.  They got that Darien Lake in between Rochester and Buffalo, and we're on in Rochester, too.  It would be perfect.  We do have to find out.  It would be perfect. 
[04:06:00]  Wants and warrants.  We have to find out if we're wanted up there.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, we went up there after that.  Okay.  We could stay in the state of Rochester, as long as we don't go in the state of Buffalo.  Yeah.  There's the state of Buffalo.  Buffalo's not part of New York.  It's its own state called Buffalo, and Rochester's a state as well.  Okay.  So as long as we stay before the border of Buffalo.  That's true.  We are in Rochester, and we are in Buffalo.  We should do something.  We had a party in Buffalo that made the corporate rule book on how not to run an event. 
[04:06:30]  Let me tell you...  Literally.  Let me tell you how bad Sex for Sam was.  We were supposed to get fired for this party we threw in Buffalo.  Yeah.  But they forgot all about that.  There were complaints sent in to the FCC.  This is all no bullshit.  Complaints were sent in to the FCC for this Buffalo thing.  It was never on the air.  Wow.  It was a live appearance.  They were so pissed off.  They still want to get us in trouble.  It was a live appearance that never aired.  Wow.  So people were so pissed at what happened. 
[04:07:00]  We had fucking strippers.  It was supposed to be stripper volleyball on the beach in Buffalo.  We had strippers.  It started out all cute.  They were batting the volleyball and stuff like that.  Within moments, the alcohol started flowing.  It ended up...  We didn't close the beach off to the public.  Oh, no.  So there were families.  Kind of not like right there, but on the periphery were families.  And the strippers, within minutes of doing a few shots, completely naked, shoving zucchini 
[04:07:30]  up each other's assholes on a public fucking beach in front of kids.  It was classic.  Oh, that's awesome.  Fucking eating each other out.  There are pictures of it on the web.  You can pop it up now to this day.  Oh, my God.  69ing on the beach with, like, a fucking kid looking on with googly-eyed.  One of the worst things we've ever done.  Oh, it was great.  Those kids remember that, that it was a clear day on the beach.  Yeah.  69 degrees.  There is some kid, like, still jerking off to that image in his head. 
[04:08:00]  Forcing dead women to do it in his bathtub.  And there were rumors they were trying to arrest us.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how true that is, to be honest.  There was, uh...  Well, the Sheriff's Department got involved because of the bar and indecency being shown  during an event at the bar.  And then the bar made believe that they didn't know us.  Oh, they turned on us in a second.  I can't even tell you.  They were running up to us so excited.  They never sold more beer.  They're like, dudes, we're running out of beer. 
[04:08:30]  This is unbelievable.  They couldn't keep the beer cold enough, so they were just serving warm beer.  No one cared.  Sure.  Because it was like their, you know, the beer in the basement that they were going to  replace after we left.  Their official statement.  If we had known that anything like this would have happened, we never, ever would have allowed  this kind of thing.  We apologize.  Liquor license is the most precious thing in the world.  They turned on us so fast.  Yeah.  We're going to leave you.  Leave you now with the sounds.  We didn't forget.  I saw the sign.  Pamela. 
[04:09:00]  The entire song.  Oh, shit.  The whole song?  The entire song.  Okay.  So we leave you.  Now I got to stay.  I usually throw the headphones off and get the fuck out.  Right.  Now I got to listen.  From our karaoke contest.  Bye, guys.  She is so bad.  And I saw the sign.  See you tomorrow.  The whole version.  I saw it.  What'd you see?  I saw it.  I saw it. 
[04:09:30]  I got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad.  I'm a new person.  I love you.  I love you.  I don't bother. 
[04:10:00]  You're not the one for me.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  Love you till you belong. 
[04:10:30]  I got a new game.  There's any fears I've wanted.  Who you are.  I'm a new person.  Love you.  We enjoy.  I'm with a pale moon.  Where I see a lot of stars.  I saw the sign. 
[04:11:00]  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  But where do you belong?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I saw the sign. 
[04:11:30]  And it opened up my eyes.  And I am hoping I'm living without you.  I left you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong. 
[04:12:00]  The sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Holy fuck.  All right.  We didn't leave.  Look.  Yeah.  How could we leave?  How could we leave? 
[04:12:30]  We couldn't leave or not comment after that.  Oh my God.  That is gold.  Yeah.  Phenomenal.  I'll tell you right now, ONA Traveling Virus, she has to do that song in front of 10,000  people.  Oh, my God.  Live.  Has to.  The clip that we've been listening to is great.  It's gold, right.  That is-  Well, that was a real effort.  She really got it.  Oh, my God.  Well, you got to remember, too, she had no idea that it was going to become what it became.  Right.  A hit.  A hit?  Like, you ask musicians.  Like, you know, you ask, you know, the guys from Zeppelin, you ask them with Stairway 
[04:13:00]  when you were writing it and recording it, did you know it was going to become this?  That's how I feel about that song with her.  Did you know it was just going to sweep the nation like this?  Wow.  The people cannot get enough.  They want that fucking version.  So good.  That has to be emailed to me.  I want that.  When I get home, I want to open my email and have that to put in my iPod.  That fucking rules.  It's got to be, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I want to play that when my girlfriend and I are fucking. 
[04:13:30]  She's like, we're going to start listening to music and we're fucking.  All right.  It's either Sabbath or this.  What the hell of a choice?  Damn.  How about some Enigma or something?  Jesus.  Well, that was great.  There was something else in there.  Yeah, we'll get it right up immediately.  Beautiful.  All right.  Now we can get it.  Now we're out of here.  All right, pal.  Talk.  Later.  You guys have a great day.  Yeah.
