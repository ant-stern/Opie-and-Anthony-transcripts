<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts in the "After ONA Live" segment, began with a discussion of Opie and Anthony's interview with "mob wives." This transitioned into a promotional segment for a 4/20 event at Twisted Glass in Long Island.  The conversation then shifted to comedian Chris Rock and a past O&A appearance where he offered career advice to Patrice O'Neal, focusing on O'Neal's struggles with self-promotion and the harsh realities of stand-up comedy, including shared living situations and varying meal quality based on a comedian's success.  A humorous, almost intervention-style discussion about O'Neal's career and persona followed.

A call from Sirius XM employee Club Soda Kenny detailed his encounter with a possible dead body and discussed Anthony's "stalker." This led to a conversation about Bob Kelly's experience with a strong-smelling tree he dubbed a "jizz tree," resulting in a lengthy, vulgar comedic exchange about the smell and its resemblance to semen.  The tree's true identity as an ornamental pear tree was eventually revealed. Several Sirius XM staff members, including Rich Davis, Nicole Biggins, and Stanley T., briefly participated. The show concluded with an announcement of a contest for the most annoying 30-second sound clip, showcasing submitted examples and briefly mentioning Ron Bennington's discomfort during a past O&A appearance.

A subsequent segment heavily featured Ron and Fez's ongoing attempt to train Fez's cat to say "cookie."  The previous day's efforts, described as a "rollercoaster" of near successes and failures, fell short due to time constraints.  The hosts expressed excitement for "part two" of the cat training, discussing Fez's improvisational skills and persistence, and listener reactions ranging from criticism to enthusiastic support.  A humorous comparison was made between Fez's efforts and a scene from *Everybody Loves Raymond*, with the cat playing Fez's role.  The segment also briefly mentioned an upcoming guest, Phil Rosenthal (creator of *Everybody Loves Raymond*), to discuss a Russian remake of his show.  A discussion about a prior appearance by Sammy "The Bull" Gravano's daughter, highlighting an uncomfortable exchange with Anthony about her father, was compared to a more respectful interaction with Gotti's daughter.  Finally, a side conversation arose about Eastside Dave's $15 sports bet with Opie, which Opie perceived as Dave treating him like a bookie.  The segment concluded with a promotion for the upcoming Ron and Fez show, highlighting the cat's anticipated verbal breakthrough.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony have left, geez, scorch into mob wives.  I don't know what better a combination you could have, but I did fear for Ant for a moment  when he asked Sammy, when he informed Sammy the Bull's daughter.  That's Sammy the Bull's daughter, right? 
[00:00:30]  When he informed her that she could talk because her father had...  Danny, you're still in here cleaning up the studio.  Isn't your friend's... It's 420. Isn't your friend's thing today?  It is today.  You talked about it yesterday.  I did.  Well, I forgot what it was already.  Oh, well, it's because you don't pay attention, and I don't think this is your kind of party.  This isn't for you.  It's Travis's party. I see, Travis.  They're probably going to have snacks and stuff down there, but they're not going to have pizza rolls and things that you have.  What kind of snacks are they going to have?  Just adult pizza, probably.  What's adult pizza?  Like a slice of it, not like a roll that you put in a toaster oven.  Yeah, but you could cut off the tip and roll it.  Well, you could pretend. Is that what you do? Do you roll up, like, whole slices? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, I order a slice, and then I cut it into threes, and then I roll it up.  Well, that's not that. It is 420. It's going to be 420 all day.  Eric's smoking the ganja.  If he is, I don't know. If he is...  Eric's down for the green.  I know he's down with the munchies, so if he's...  He just has the munchies.  Yeah, he just tells people he smokes.  But, yeah, they're huge fans of ONA. They're big, big, big-time fans, and they asked me if it would be cool to let everyone...  Because they want all the ONA fans to know that they're all invited. 
[00:01:30]  All the pests and fans.  The pot pests.  They could all go down to Twisted Glass and Wontaw all day until midnight and have fun and raffles, and then everybody's going to be celebrating the big day.  So that's Wontaw and Long Island?  Yeah, South Shore.  All right. TwistedGlassShop.com, everybody. Go have fun.  All right. Twisted Glass celebrating.  Now, E-Rock, I heard that you just, like, on 420, you celebrate with brownies, but you just say, without the pot, that's fine.  Yeah, the pot's just totally a cover for me to overindulge. 
[00:02:00]  You just want the brownies.  Eric just shoves food in his face. He just goes, dude, it's so high.  Were you upset, Eric, that you didn't even need to heat up those hot pockets? I just eat them frozen.  Just eat them, yeah.  Yeah, sometimes you chip a tooth, but big deal. What do you need them for?  Were you upset that you didn't get a picture with the mob wives?  Because I know you like your pictures, I mean, almost as much as I do, but not quite as much.  I don't know anything.  I mean, other than who their, like, husbands and fathers are, I don't know anything about them or their show.  So are you going to be bummed out when you watch the show, and then you're like, oh, shit, I could have gotten a picture with them.  I don't think I'm going to watch their show. 
[00:02:30]  Why?  Because who cares?  They're like bitches fighting with each other.  No, they're right behind me in the Al-Q studio.  Say bitches.  Because, no, you're right.  Did you fear for Anthony when he made the Sammy the Bull joke to his daughter?  Did you hear that, or were you back?  I was in the back, but I mean, what is he going to do?  Like, nothing's going to happen to him.  I guess so, but I mean, at some point something could.  Well, let's just walk a different way to work in the morning.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  He has security.  We don't.  A bunch of stuff happened, but before any of that, we were talking about Chris Rock and the Chris Rock play.  Jim went to see Chris Rock's play.  Motherfucker in a hat.  Or with a hat.  Yeah, motherfucker in a hat is just you.  That too.  Yes, he went to see the play yesterday.  He said it was fabulous, which I think is Broadway lingo, and he said Chris Rock acted better than he could have ever expected in the play, that he completely got lost. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  I would recommend seeing the play if Jim Norton enjoyed it, because he doesn't just give his endorsement to anything, but it brought up a conversation of the last time Chris Rock did O&A.  He hasn't done our show in a long time.  I don't know why he doesn't, but why would I know?  I'm not an informed person.  Hopefully he will soon, because the last time he was in, he was in with Patrice, and they kind of got to running down why Patrice hasn't been successful in this industry.  Yeah, they went through the list of shows, and Patrice has been on some really big shows, but he didn't last that long. 
[00:04:00]  What's great, too, is that he auditioned for the role that Terry Crews got of Chris Rock's father on Everybody Hates Chris, correct?  Yeah.  And Chris said basically, well, you know what?  We'll let Chris say it to Patrice, won't we?  I don't need to tell you what Chris said.  You can listen for yourself.  Hopefully we'll get the mob wives out of here, because I feel like we can't talk freely.  I know, apparently they canceled another show that was supposed to get them and just slid them into O&A. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, well, I guess we lucked out.  Which is, you know, props to Roland and Spencer again.  This is a gruesome twosome when it comes to talent booking.  But this is Chris Rock, speaking of talent booking, one of the best talents we've ever had on the show, talking to Patrice O'Neill, giving him some career advice right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Patrice decided it was a good idea to get a website a mere three months ago.  Wow.  Remember all the times you would come on the show and like, do you have a website to promote yourself? 
[00:05:00]  That's how you get the show.  Exactly.  That's how he did it.  He doesn't know how to promote.  He goes, I feel weird promoting.  Do you see him trying now, though?  You are trying.  Jesus.  Patrice's brilliance is as a comedian.  You're playing some big rooms now, right?  You know, I'll get back to you.  Yes.  Thank you, Chris.  It's funny.  As a business man, it's time to plug myself.  I'm doing maybe a thousand is probably the maximum.  That's so funny.  Hey, you're out to clubs.  Yeah.  You made it.  That's the goal of every comic is to get out of the chuckle huts. 
[00:05:30]  My only goal, I swear to you, was to be famous enough to not have to do radio.  That was it.  Not that I'm going to be up now, but I mean, you know.  I don't have to do radio and I don't have to stay in the comedian condo.  That's all I wanted.  You mean you're on the road.  I want it to be like down my era, George Wallace was my goal.  He's been on the show a bunch.  Yeah.  That was my goal.  He shot past that.  We should talk about the condo thing. 
[00:06:00]  A lot of people out there don't understand when you guys go to these cities, you have  to stay in the same condo that other comics were in the week before.  The same sheets.  Right.  Because they're trying to just save money.  They're trying to save money.  So these guys buy an actual condo.  Comedians are disgusting.  Right.  Right.  I can't even imagine.  You got to share.  You got to share sometimes with.  I've done so many gigs with a headliner in the middle act.  Sometimes you have to share.  If you're not a headliner, you share the room with the.  Some strange comic you barely know.  Like damn near bunk beds.  Right.  It's like. 
[00:06:30]  Oh.  Yeah, I've done that.  I woke up one time.  It was three comedians in a room and I woke up and the two guys had left.  We had like a two hour drive to the next game.  They just left a note like we'll meet you there.  Dirt bags.  Hint.  You ever had that thing where you're at the club and they have the meal, the menu,  and then there's the stuff the headliner can eat.  But if you're an opener.  Oh, no way.  You can't get shrimp.  Oh, my God.  The chintzy ass.  What crap is that?  The middles can't get scallops.  We're sorry. 
[00:07:00]  You can have the chicken wings.  Chicken wings for you.  I was doing a club recently up in Massachusetts and they said that the MCs, the opening acts,  couldn't get soda.  I'm like, you don't give the guys.  I can see alcohol.  You know what I don't like?  Wow.  I saw one that said, don't touch the waitresses.  Was that a problem?  You know what's bothering me about this conversation?  What?  That Norton and Chris Rock are having a nostalgic conversation that I still live.  If you had the right attitude, you're as funny as both of us. 
[00:07:30]  I'm not going to sit here and say I'm funnier than you.  I guess it's time to tell you this is an intervention for you.  You thought we were having Chris Rock to promote his New Year's gig, but it's really an intervention  to get you on the right track.  How do people be able to move on from old school news?  I'm not like that.  I'll tell you what it is.  As a comedian.  You're like Whitney Houston.  You're going to have to be clean for 10 years before we buy it.  Like, ooh, we're supposed to just buy it now?  But she's looking good again. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We've got to prove it to the public.  I need four crackless albums.  I'm going to have to be like Michael Vick after he gets out.  I'm going to take care of dogs.  You're going to work at a shelter.  You're going to pet every dog you see walking by.  You're going to have to shake hands with a few audience members as they walk out.  I thank the club owner for having you.  It's not your act.  People love your act.  It's who you are.  It's who you are.  They hate you.  They just hate you as a person. 
[00:08:30]  This is your intervention.  I've been waiting for this day.  There is no awful human beings.  I'm a good person.  I'm just, it's just.  You just got a thing about you.  I can name 10 guys.  You're funny.  And you know what?  And quick, you know what?  This is how you know.  This is how you know.  Way more successful than you.  This is Chris.  Chris is talking to me like a middle-aged white man.  That's how middle-aged white people talk to me.  You know I'm finished because Chris is like, look, my son.  You need to work on this.  If you think it's just jokes, you got. 
[00:09:00]  Jokes are only half the battle.  This is every conversation you have about Patrice goes like this.  He's a funny guy.  This is years ago.  This is in the mid-90s.  I used to do this.  I met him.  I hated Patrice.  He's a pomposity.  I met him, and he was like, we're doing this hell gig for Jamie Dukin.  It was a college.  I was opening.  You keep telling that story.  I killed that room, by the way.  You didn't kill that room.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:09:30]  It's not about the comedy.  It's not about the jokes.  It's a delusion of who he is.  I had maybe a one.  Help me help you.  He's Rod Tidwell.  I like to see him sweat.  It's rare you sweat on our show, man.  All right.  I guess it's a deal.  Nobody's got a bad thing to say.  No.  No.  Except for about as funny.  Just my essence stinks. 
[00:10:00]  Before they trash you, they'll say things like, yeah, it's funny.  Are you friends with him?  I don't know.  Patrice O'Neal will not be at the garden.  He'll be at the undergarden.  Chris Rock wants to make it perfectly clear.  He doesn't want you painting his garden a pair.  There's the 5,000, there's the 20,000, and then there's the bathroom. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, poor Patrice.  Hey, are you working with anybody in the garden?  Jill Scott.  Jill Scott for the ladies.  She's opening?  Yeah, she's opening.  Wow.  I don't know Jill Scott.  I don't either.  Okay.  I want to find out about...  If you were having sex with a black woman, you'd know.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  She's big.  Yeah.  Neo soul, as they used to call it.  I don't know.  Oh, wait.  She's the performer.  She does music.  Yeah, yeah.  I knew...  All right.  I know who...  Oh, she's not a comic?  No, no.  Oh, you was thinking comedian Jill Scott?  I was thinking comedian Jill Scott.  I've heard of Jill Scott.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't really know what she...  I just know she's in music.  That's smart. 
[00:11:00]  Have music in front of you, because this way you don't have to worry about somebody stepping  on everything you want to talk about.  Exactly.  That's why Pryor did it with Patti LaBelle.  Exactly.  I'm going to start doing that music.  When I saw Dane Cook at the garden, it was just him and a stool.  No opening act, nothing.  Hour and a half.  Dane just came out.  Yeah.  I'm like, wow, that's pretty pompous.  Not even a warm-up.  35 minutes of scream.  Right, right.  Give us a band or something to hang out with for a while.  I hate working in the round.  Not that I have an opportunity to do it.  Believe me, I very rarely do.  Shut up, stupid.  You're not in the round yet. 
[00:11:30]  Not even in Westbury.  You can't count the Westbury Music Fair.  I'm only doing half.  Believe me, every time I'm in the round, there's a curtain.  It's like, well, we've got to be more intimate.  You're in the crescent.  And no one wants to see your back.  You were getting to something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When you hosted the Oscars.  All we had to hear was from Rich Voss about how he was writing for Chris Rock.  Good.  Finally. 
[00:12:00]  And all I wanted to do was...  He might have got a couple in there.  Did he?  Yeah, I think he got that.  He bragged about that for a year.  And the intros.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All he was talking about, though, is, well, I got to get over and see Chris.  I'm writing.  It's like, what could you possibly be writing?  He would call us from L.A. in between writing sessions.  And just talk about that.  Make sure everyone knew what he was doing.  Every time we talked to him, he had to bring that up.  Yeah.  And it's still one of his big credits.  How long after you hired Voss did you realize, all right, this was a mistake? 
[00:12:30]  He's a nice guy, but he contributes very little, and he's dumb.  He'd have some stuff.  Dumb as dirt.  He'd have some stuff.  I forgot you posted, man.  That was so great.  It was so fun to watch.  It was so great, they never called again.  Good, though.  What the hell was that about?  Wait, wait.  Did it again?  Hold on.  I'll tell you what that's about.  That means you did a great job.  As a comedian, you were a comedian doing the Oscars.  It was great to watch.  Just smashing them.  I loved it.  That stupid Jude Law.  Oh, who is he?  That was so great.  And then Sean Penn, who's one of our finest.  Shut your mouth up.  One of our finest actors. 
[00:13:00]  Boy, what a sense of humor that guy's got.  As we'll say, Sean should have taken the joke.  Oh, what a douche.  It was just nice to see a comic doing that and not being polite to them, but really tearing  the throat.  Absolutely.  It was great, man.  Thank you.  Could you hang for a little longer?  See how I said thank you?  Wait a minute.  Let me practice.  That goes a long way.  That goes a long way, Patrice.  Thank you, Chris.  See, I'm going to follow you.  Let me just practice saying thank you to people.  Just say something to me, Owen.  I don't have anything I can say to you.  It's okay. 
[00:13:30]  Thanks anyway for...  I'm trying to learn instead of going, ugh.  This is Patrice in the compliment because he is a sweet guy, but he doesn't know how to  get love.  He's got that tough outer shell that you've got to break through.  If you said Patrice, that hosting job you did was so good that one time.  Shut up!  Right, right.  That's Patrice.  Patrice doesn't realize he's a big black man.  So he thinks he's going, hey, how you doing?  But what we hear is...  Ooga booga! 
[00:14:00]  Thank you so much for the opportunity.  Ooga booga booga booga booga booga!  People who don't like Patrice hate him.  Because he gets to people because if he teases you, he's loud.  You're not going to be louder than he is.  No.  I never realized he couldn't take a compliment properly.  Because I had complimented you on your appearances on The Office.  Even though they were very brief, but you were very good.  Can I tell you really quickly why...  People always, when they write for Patrice, they make sure they can write him out, too. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know how this is going to work.  Put a pre-existing medical condition in the character description.  It starts off with diabetes in the show.  He's boisterous with a heart condition.  Just in case.  That fun-loving, weak-hearted man.  It starts off with diabetes in a doctor's appointment.  First episode.  First episode.  You could go into a coma in season two.  They don't want to lose a minute of production time. 
[00:15:00]  If you're lucky.  Oh, man.  Actually, Arrested Development, too.  I love that show.  I think I got thrown out of there for the same reason.  Why?  I don't think I said thank you.  Yeah.  See, that's your problem.  What are you going to do?  I don't...  What are you...  Just...  Hey, we...  Just be nice.  After ONA.  Live.  You're a complete wreck, Eric.  You're like...  Sorry, I got...  I got startled when I looked over at the console and who your guest was.  How long have you been doing this?  How long have you been working in radio? 
[00:15:30]  Not long enough, apparently.  How long has it been, really?  A long time.  How long?  A long time.  You're in your mid-30s.  Early 30s.  Early to mid-30s.  Sure.  We're compromised.  And what age did you start this thing?  16.  Okay, so you're approaching 20 years in the business.  Oh, 15 years in the business.  And you still can't hit the cues on the after show.  Yeah, I put that card a little too close.  Well, it is what it is.  You're right.  He's using cards?  What is this?  This is 1987?  He doesn't know what he's doing in there, Rich. 
[00:16:00]  Rich and Nicole from the morning mashup were just walking by and they wanted to come in.  What was the mashup like today?  You know what?  The mashup was good.  It was a little stressful.  No, at the best.  We have a new thing that I find hilarious is that Stanley T has, you know, crutches when  you say the same shit over and over on the air, and he can't stop saying, of course.  And of course.  And of course.  And of course.  And of course.  Oh, there he is.  Tell him to come in here.  We're going to do the morning mashup.  Come on in.  He goes, it's serious sex and hits one.  And of course.  And of course.  It's Stanley T. 
[00:16:30]  Of course.  And of course.  It's Stanley T.  You all can kiss the baby.  And another thing he does.  All he does is he quotes old shit.  You only got no show.  That's what you spend your lives talking about me.  You got a life.  He's that big of a celebrity.  What Stan will do is he quotes other famous black men.  Yeah.  No, he doesn't.  He watches the Chad Ochocinco show when it was on like years ago.  Do you quote Ochocinco?  You sit there quoting Ochocinco?  No, no.  I thought you meant like Malcolm X.  A quotable black man. 
[00:17:00]  There are a lot of black sayings that he uses.  Like child please.  These are things I grew up with.  He thinks I'm taking them.  And you're just stealing them from Chad Ochocinco.  Yeah, that's what he thinks.  So did you guys have the mob wives on?  We didn't.  Was that the one blonde one?  Was that a mob wife?  Yeah.  She was dynamite.  The other ones were weathered.  Like fucking Carl Weathers.  I mean, listen.  You can say what you want about the mob wives, but that's going to stay in the Rich Davis  camp because I know who they're related to.  I'm not going to make jokes about mob wives.  Where's Rich?  You got whacked.  Why did the morning mashup have mob wives?  You know, I'm not into that reality show. 
[00:17:30]  It's a hit.  What difference does it make?  Why didn't you tell the truth?  You said they weren't important enough.  I didn't say that.  Now you're just making up crap.  It's true.  Okay.  And there's so many reality shows we talk about, so we've got to cut out some.  I can't watch them all.  Okay.  Now, I'm noticing in the room right now there's a lot of chemistry here.  There is.  Obie and Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez have both told me that I need to get the fuck off  this show.  Like, I need to find something else.  Okay. 
[00:18:00]  Is this working for the mashup, do you think?  So what are you suggesting?  That we get rid of Ryan and add you?  Oh, I forgot he wasn't here.  Who's Ryan?  That's so weird.  So what are we thinking?  Who's Ryan?  Roland, is this working?  Are you listening?  Is this for some working?  Yeah.  They've got good chemistry.  They told me I needed to leave the show, Obie and Ron.  They said that to you?  Yeah.  Wow.  They said, this is the advice.  Just get out of here.  Do something else.  They did.  Is this for some here working?  You should.  The new morning mashup?  Yeah, you should. 
[00:18:30]  And I'll bring Roland.  I mean, he booked the mob wives.  Oh, cool.  We could have the mob wives if I were there.  Well, okay.  Oh, okay.  Great.  Roland, you're full of life today.  You seem to have so much energy, so much to say.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  Eric?  You're just pointing and stuff.  No, Rich was going to talk.  I was telling Roland to switch mics.  Oh, oh, oh.  You can see Eric?  I got a little monitor.  I'll bring the monitor with me if I can be on the mashup.  Oh, you're on.  You're in.  That was sweet.  Let's try it.  It's the morning mashup on Series X and it's one, and of course, 20 on 20, with Rich 
[00:19:00]  Davis, Stanley T, Nicole Biggins, and Sam.  And Sam fucking Roberts.  Yeah.  Does that work?  Can you drop that bombs?  I like the...  I see the adults loving that.  Well, what you have to do is you have to be a modified version of yourself, as you know,  Sam.  Ah.  And I don't know if it would work for you.  Yeah, sure.  You know the dual life I live doing Covino and Rich and the morning mashup?  Yeah.  Can you be a family-friendly sitting at the Christmas dinner table version of yourself  every day?  Let me tell you something.  Primetime Sam Roberts is one way.  Overnight Sam Roberts on Hits One is just as milquetoast as they come. 
[00:19:30]  You know what I mean?  I don't get to hear it, so I don't know.  I haven't...  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm just your lead-in.  Sorry you don't wake up before your show.  Okay.  You don't need to be bitter and angry towards me.  I know what comes on before Opie and Anthony.  You should check it out sometime.  You sounded kind of bitter, Sam.  What's the matter?  What's the real problem?  Well, Stan, I know you listen to what comes on before your show.  Uh, yeah.  See?  That's my man.  That's my man.  And, of course, my man, Stanley T.  And, of course, Stanley T. 
[00:20:00]  What are you running at?  ONA are doing a contest for the most annoying 30 seconds.  I like that.  People can enter.  It's at SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  That's where all the rules are.  You just send them in to Opie and Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  Somebody's going to win $2,000 cash for making the most annoying 30 seconds.  I need, like, an example.  Okay, here's one of them.  This one is...  You're good at this radio stuff.  This one is from Sean Baker.  Oh, my God, dude. 
[00:20:30]  Was that a pickle jar?  That was the most annoying thing I've ever heard in my life.  That was really good.  That was good.  Is that... 
[00:21:00]  Are you panicking, like, in your hits one minor?  You go, we got to get back to the music.  What are we playing here?  We got to get back to the music.  Yeah.  It's actually really convenient.  You know what that was?  That sound?  Because it's got to be, like, ONA related.  That was actually Bob Kelly puking.  That's how he pukes?  Yeah.  Well, do you want to hear how he pukes?  Do you guys...  Yeah, I want to hear the real Bob Kelly pukes.  Because Opie put on his Twitter, his Twitter's Opie Radio, his YouTube is also Opie Radio,  and he retweeted this YouTube video of Bob Kelly puking at what he called the jizz trees. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, dear.  He said there are trees in New York City, and they smell like jizz, and when he smells  them...  Roland, you remember this, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When he smells them, he has to puke, so we decided to...  He told the story on the air, and we decided to go out and get some of the flowers.  Jizz trees.  Right.  And we brought them to the air.  Morning mashup.  Enjoy with all of us.  This is Bob Kelly and the jizz trees.  After ONA Live.  Got a pretty good show going on today, and Robert Kelly's going to join the festivities 
[00:22:00]  right now.  Where's Bobby?  Bring Bobby in.  Bring in Bob.  Bob Kelly running down the hall.  Look at this.  Bobby hasn't been on in a while.  I know.  He's been away in Los Angeles.  It's been a while since we've seen Bobby.  Bobby!  What are you doing in L.A.?  Where have you been?  Hi.  Hi, sweetie.  What's up?  What are you doing in L.A.?  Fucking dumb chair.  It's not you.  Why is it so high?  Bobby's having trouble with the chair.  Fuck it, I'll stand. 
[00:22:30]  Dude, yes, I'm...  You know what?  I am an L.A. guy kind of now.  Why?  I don't know what happened.  I quit smoking.  I woke up every day.  Ran up a canyon.  You run up canyons?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  It's just fucking trees.  Please.  Fucking cheese trees in New York.  Why? 
[00:23:00]  He smells cum flowers.  Fucking cheese trees in New York, you cunts.  You smell them?  You're fucking Jack in New York, Anthony.  Welcome home, Bobby.  Welcome home, Bobby.  I hate the fucking smell.  I think I was molested or something.  Please take this off.  Please. 
[00:23:30]  Put the new one on.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  Get it.  Just put it.  Bobby, what is this all about?  Yeah, I don't understand what this is about.  What is this all about?  What are you talking about, cum trees in New York?  Dude, there's jizz trees in New York City.  What does that mean?  They do smell like cum.  They smell like fucking...  Smell that, dude.  Have you smelled them?  I smell that.  Smell it, Bobby.  It smells like a fucking someone, like nine guys just danked on your cheek. 
[00:24:00]  I can't fucking take it.  The whole neighborhood.  It stinks.  It smells like fucking jizz all the time.  Oh, God.  It smells...  You know when you...  Oh.  Look, I fucking smelled...  You know, you jerk off.  You get a little on your hand.  Yeah.  You get it on your cheek.  Talk to the mic.  It smells like it.  It does.  I smelled it.  It was okay.  I mean, it was strong, but it wasn't that bad.  You're not a magician.  I...  You're a fucking dickhead.  I've seen him. 
[00:24:30]  All right, Chris, Santa, you...  Oops, sorry.  It's fucking terrible, dude.  I can't take it.  Yeah, you don't like that.  I don't like what?  Jizzy smell.  No.  No, I don't.  Do you?  I'm sorry.  No.  Am I stepping over a fucking Italian?  Boundary?  Fucking disrespect my family.  Jizz is part of our lives.  This is what your fucking face would smell like if Anthony jizzed on it.  This is how much jizz comes out of his huge dick.  So what?  Because the trees are blossoming. 
[00:25:00]  They smell like cum.  Oh, the fucking microphone smells like cum.  And the microphone smells like a cum.  Dude.  You know what?  We all took a whiff and...  Steve at the bar is a friend of mine.  He gave me my cum for free.  He gave me...  He gave me HIV.  HIV.  He bombs with his jokes.  He'll treat your cock like a smoke. 
[00:25:30]  And stick it where food ought to be.  Bobby, we all took a whiff and it's a really, really bad smell.  Dude, I actually...  This fucking...  I was walking around all weekend smelling jizz.  And I'm just...  I'm like...  Wondering why the fuck am I smelling that?  I started getting mad at my wife.  Oh, no.  I'm not kidding, dude.  I was walking around and I'm smelling it.  She's like, do you smell it?  She's like, no.  And then I'm like, is this bitch... 
[00:26:00]  Is this fuck...  Come here.  I was like, good old...  Let me smell your fucking face and chest and hands.  Like, are you fucking...  Did you do something?  How did you finally find out what it was?  Dude, I...  It had to be the fucking jizz trees.  These white trees in New York City.  I grabbed one of the leaves off it.  Well, it's not even leaves yet.  They're just blossoming.  So it's like the blossoming of the leaves is giving off this really bad smell.  Do we know the actual name of the tree that you're calling the jizz tree? 
[00:26:30]  Jizz tree.  I got a photo of it if you want to fucking give Danny some help.  We actually watched it on your YouTube video.  I think...  I don't know.  Look, I know that it's pollen because I put the thing to my nose and it was like it fucking jizzed all over my face because the pollen was all over my face.  I don't...  Does tree fucking jizz smell like...  Human jizz?  Can I ask you a question?  Yes, sir.  What smells worse?  Can I do this?  What smells worse?  That or my belly button?  You smell...  Take a whiff of my belly button? 
[00:27:00]  Dude, I don't have to...  You could fucking...  I showered this morning.  You could put this jizz on a dead guy's belly button and then shit on it.  Well...  And I would say you.  Take a whiff of Jimmy's belly button and tell us which is worse.  I don't know what it smells like.  There's actually nothing there.  Oh, boo.  I showered like an asshole.  I do shower.  Listen, fucking magician boy.  I know your tricks.  Fucking asshole.  Still trying to do the fucking...  I showered.  Small ball, little ball trick to me.  I get it.  All right.  Fair enough. 
[00:27:30]  Hang in there, Bobby.  Hang in there.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby, come on.  Hang in there.  And he's holding the jizz tree thing.  Come on, Bobby.  He's going to run his head.  This fucking jizz thing is terrible.  I can't take jizz in massive amounts.  You don't sound like a fun guy. 
[00:28:00]  I can't.  What'd you say?  You don't sound like a very fun guy.  Can we eat too much jizz?  Can you take a full whiff of the jizz tree?  I just did.  It's fucking...  No, don't we have another bag of it somewhere?  Someone went out and...  It does smell like cum, dude.  I mean, it really does.  Yeah, you're a fucking mad smell.  Like dirty, though.  It's dirty.  It smells a heck of a lot.  No, Bobby, we all smell it.  We fucking...  Why am I...  Why am I discovering this?  Hold on, hold on.  We're not happy with the smell, but you take it to a whole new level.  It's a horrible smell.  But why...  But it makes you fucking puke.  Why am I discovering this? 
[00:28:30]  Why hasn't this been discovered?  It's fucking 2010.  We have iPads and shit.  The jizz tree should have been fucking discovered in like the 1800s.  It's the jizz tree.  Yeah, like every 48 years, the jizz tree comes back.  Yeah.  And fucking blossoms and everybody smells like fucking...  Loads and Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen.  They're saying it's the flowering dogwood.  Someone else is saying it's the Bradford...  I think that's how you say it, too.  Bradford pear.  There's probably a bunch of names.  Like chicken cacciatore is also fucking Hunter's chicken. 
[00:29:00]  You know what I mean?  There's a bunch of names.  It is.  Derek mentioned dogwood.  Dogwood?  It does look like...  I mean, the flowers do look very similar.  It looks like it's the dogwood tree and they're blooming and it's giving off this horrendous  smell.  I don't know why I can't take this much load.  Oh, really?  You don't know why?  No.  It brings you back to another time.  Snip that.  Yep.  It brings you back to when you were younger and you were trying to do something innocent  and an older man was coming into his own hand and feeding it to you like a little... 
[00:29:30]  like a zoo animal.  You're going to tell the story.  Be specific.  In the closet.  You're going to buy the fucking grain out of a machine.  And he even knew not to curl his fingers in so you wouldn't bite his fingers like a  fucking horse eating an apple.  Flat hand.  I think Jimmy's on to something there, Bobby.  I think so.  Yeah, well, we got you.  It actually came up.  Sperm tree?  Spunk tree?  Yeah, well, according to the Urban Dictionary, there's a sperm tree, which is saying the same 
[00:30:00]  thing.  It smells like sperm.  It's the ornamental pear tree.  So let me pop that into some...  Spunk tree?  Sperm tree?  Spunk tree?  Look at that shit.  You see?  People thought of this before.  You're on to something, Bobby.  Oh, that's definitely it.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the fucking...  That's the jizz tree.  The ornamental pear tree.  That's the jizz tree of fucking New York City right there.  That's the culprit.  That's why all gay guys are walking around singing and smiling every afternoon.  Backing into trees.  That's why they all...  I love the spring.  Of course you do.  So we figured out what the jizz tree is? 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Judging from the images and the Urban Dictionary, the jizz tree is indeed the ornamental pear  tree, everybody.  Ornamental pear tree.  A.K.A.  We got to the bottom of it, Bobby.  The jizz tree.  Mystery has been solved.  Oh, fuck.  You really have a hard time with that.  It definitely loses its fucking potency after you cut it off the tree.  Or it dries up on your stomach.  Just like regular jizz. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, when you peel it off an hour later, it doesn't have the same potency.  It's not as good when you have fruit roll up it off your belly and eat it.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Tastes like grilled cheese.  It's not as good when you let the hot water hit it and it turns to fucking egg in the shower.  Yeah.  Fucking rubber cement on your stomach hairs.  After ONA Live.  Yes, it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  That was Bob Kelly and the jizz trees.  Opie, as I said, retweeted the video that he took of Bob puking to the jizz trees. 
[00:31:30]  He retweeted it sometime yesterday.  His Twitter name and YouTube name are both Opie Radio, as if you didn't already know that.  But, yeah, I highly recommend checking out the video because if you've never seen Robert  Kelly, comedian Robert Kelly puking, it's a sight to see.  He just, I mean, his whole entire bald head turns beet red.  His eyes get all teary.  It's the greatest thing in the world.  I think, as a matter of fact, he's coming in tomorrow? 
[00:32:00]  Is he coming in tomorrow?  Yeah, he's in tomorrow.  Oh, this is exciting.  Bob Kelly, he called in to special delivery as well over the weekend because he admitted  that he's back on the wrestling bandwagon.  But I doubt that he'll admit that on Opie and Anthony's show.  Of course, we've got to thank the morning mashup for stopping by.  Sorry, Mark Zito, you missed your pal some morning mashup as he sets up for Ron and Fez.  But the morning mashup, I don't know what they were doing.  They were wandering around in the hallway.  But, E-Rock, are they together always?  Yeah, they show up together. 
[00:32:30]  They do the show.  They take their breaks together.  And then when they're finished, as Kenny knows their schedule very well.  Of course he does.  He's just a creep.  Um, so when they finish a little earlier than we do, so they'll walk by and then they all  go to breakfast together.  I don't know what they were, yeah, but this is off schedule for them.  I mean, they were still all together, but I don't know what they were doing, um, wandering  around at this time.  Oh, also, the only reason I know that they all go to breakfast together is Kenny has  expressed that he gets hurt that they don't invite him to go to breakfast.  Why would they invite him? 
[00:33:00]  He's on the job.  You know how he is.  What's that photographer doing out there?  Is there some more famous people coming here?  I don't know.  I'll go take a look.  Fine.  Yeah.  See if we can find out.  Um, speaking of club soda, I, yeah, by the way, the morning mashup walking together,  maybe it's just odd for us coming from the world that we come from where when the mics  turn off and everybody who's associated with the show completely dispersed in opposite  directions, no talking, no eye contact, nothing, but maybe that's just us.  Um, speaking of club soda, Kenny, I talked to him. 
[00:33:30]  Uh, Opie told a story at the beginning of the show today and throughout the show.  Well, Kenny was on twice about finding what he thought was a dead body.  Uh, and Kenny just driving right by it.  It didn't phase him whatsoever.  Kenny's basically a robot at this point, but we talked to him about not only that, but  also about aunt stalker who was brought up again on the air today.  She's still leaving texts and voicemails and whatnot, but this is club soda, Kenny in the  hallway.  We really only talked to him because he sits in the hallway and he gets very bored. 
[00:34:00]  So we figured, you know, if I talked to him, we, I, I figured if I talked to him for a little  while, at least he'll fill up some of his time.  Here's Kenny club soda.  Big day for you today.  Check, check.  One, two, check.  Test.  I did that before.  Oh, big day for you today.  How so?  Two major appearances so far?  Two for two.  Now, are you legitimately worried you drove by what could have potentially been a dead body  this morning?  Uh, are you worried that you're now suspects? 
[00:34:30]  No, I could care less.  I minded my business.  I did the right thing.  Do you think, uh, I'll be bringing up all the questions.  It's just not a good idea.  No, he just wanted to make a video.  He's a filmmaker.  I thought he was a radio guy.  No, that's what he does.  Which?  No, don't you see, like, his bio on Twitter?  It says, like, he gave up his modeling career to tell dick jokes on the radio and make films  about people that he can beat up or something like that. 
[00:35:00]  You don't remember, do you?  It, it, that's the gist of it.  What about this, uh, stalker that Anthony has with all the texting and the calling?  Isn't there something he could do?  Yeah, ignore her.  Not talk about her on the radio?  Negative.  You think this is only helping her?  Exactly.  What is her motive?  Cock.  This is a place of business and you're in a public hallway of the work area.  Well, I'm an honest person. 
[00:35:30]  You asked me a question, I answered honestly.  They were making fun of your suit today.  What, why?  Let, let me read you a little something.  You'll have to edit this for a time.  No problem.  Sam, if you look sharp, people will assume that you are sharp.  If you look sloppy, people will assume that you perform sloppy work.  And you have to act sharp.  Carry yourself with professionalism and authority. 
[00:36:00]  Know your job and be confident in your abilities.  Keep your temper in check.  If you lose your temper, you lose control of the situation.  You almost lost your place.  Be the voice of reason in the midst of chaos.  What is all this from?  It's from my Blackberry.  I wrote it down so I could remember it.  Those are just things that you thought of? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, and I write them down so I don't forget them.  So why don't you get a better suit then?  Whoa, I just got a text from Jim Norton.  What did he say?  May I have a ginger ale, please?  All right, then you better take care of that, huh?  Yeah, I got to step and fetch it.  Go do your real job.  Thank you.  Wait, one more thing.  Yeah, sure.  Facebook.com slash Club Soda Kenny.  Might as well just take that out and post.  No, no, no.  I don't want people to be left out.  That's the place to be. 
[00:37:00]  Kenny really is a sad, sad person.  He used to be a cop.  He was on the beat.  He was solving crimes.  He was, you know, interacting with the roughest and toughest there was.  Tuning up people.  Tuning up people.  Well said, Iraq.  His life had a real sense of purpose.  Now he just runs errands.  It's really a horrible thing.  But speaking of sad, sad individuals, we talked about Scorch today again.  He is my radio mentor.  As I've said, everything I've learned about this business and about this industry is from Scorch and no one else. 
[00:37:30]  Scorch taught me everything I know.  And that was a lot.  There was one clip, one O&A clip.  We played again, PFG TV, which is his TV show.  If you didn't hear it, oh, A-Rock, somebody's, I'm assuming that's Club Soda Kenny on the hotline.  Yeah, just put him on hold and you can pick him up from over there.  As long as I can hear him.  I think Club Soda Kenny is going to want to sound, because I guess Club Soda Kenny is going to, yeah, pick it up.  Hello? 
[00:38:00]  Hi, Sam?  Yeah.  Kenny, I guess.  Club Soda Kenny.  You heard your voice, so you figured you'd need to call.  Yeah, you know, Facebook.com slash Club Soda Kenny?  I left the plug-in.  What are you calling up to plug for?  I can't believe you got the mashups on your show.  How'd that booking happen?  Well, I mean, I know people, and I pulled some strings, and like the Mob Wives, it just kind of fell together at the last minute.  I can't believe it. 
[00:38:30]  I'm driving home here, and all of a sudden I turn on the radio, I hear the mashups.  I know, and that's so weird, because usually when you're at work, and you're supposed to be listening to Opie and Anthony, you're listening to the mashups.  So it's like the same thing.  No, no, no.  I got two ears.  You can listen to one thing in each ear, I guess, then.  Exactly.  I have no brain to process what I listen to.  It just sounds.  Yeah, yeah.  What was your...  It amuses me. 
[00:39:00]  What was your favorite part?  What was the most amusing part of today's show for you?  Hey, Shane, did you know it's going to rain today in New York?  I just asked you a question.  I know, but I figured I'm driving home, I'd give you the traffic and weather.  Okay, so what's the weather?  It's going to rain today in New York.  Yeah, in New York.  I don't know about the rest of the country, but in New York, I believe it's going to rain.  You couldn't have checked?  If you wanted to do the weather, you could have just checked.  It's online. 
[00:39:30]  I know, but next time, maybe I'll prepare a little bit.  All right, so give me the...  You said traffic and weather, so give me the traffic report, then.  From the road, our man on the scene, Club Soda Kenny.  I'm driving home, and it's clear sound.  Driving home?  On what road?  I'm over here, you know, the way I get there.  I hear you.  Well, listen, did you wish everybody a happy Passover?  No, I didn't.  I mean, I hope everybody did have a... 
[00:40:00]  Passover's over, right, Kenny?  Yeah, especially remember Big Dick Dave, the intern?  Of course.  I think you're the only person who still calls him that, but of course, we should have played  an intern David bit to celebrate Passover.  Let's write that down for tomorrow.  Already done.  Okay.  That's a good idea.  And listen, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Facebook's last Troi Kwan.  Why are you...  Now, enough with the plugging.  He got a plug for his dumb DJ gig yesterday.  He doesn't need more plugs. 
[00:40:30]  It's not dumb.  He's on the wheels of steel on the one.  What was your favorite or most amusing part, since you can't process things, the part that  amused you most about today's Opie and Anthony show?  The part of what?  The part of the show that amused you most.  Anytime you speak.  You like that?  What about when you speak?  When I speak, I've spoken.  Tell me this, Kenny.  What do you think of the Mob Wives? 
[00:41:00]  Because you're somebody who is on the other side of law enforcement.  The Mob Wives kind of just came in at the very end of today's show.  Catch the replay if you missed it.  But what did you think, as a man who used to work for law enforcement, and I stress, used  to work for law enforcement, what did you think of the Mob Wives?  They're beautiful people.  Let them live and be well.  God bless them.  Well, you don't have any judgments about what they're coming from or what they're profiting  off of or anything like that?  Hey, Sam, I got news for you. 
[00:41:30]  If it wasn't for people like them, people like us wouldn't have jobs.  Who's us?  I'm not a cop.  No, you're undercover.  Oh, shh.  Don't blow it, Club Soda.  You're like 21 Jump Street.  Just like that.  Richard Grieco.  Yeah.  Johnny's back.  And, Kenny, before you go, too, tell me about the possible dead body.  Did we confirm whether or not this is a dead or alive guy?  The guy called in and said it was just some drunk. 
[00:42:00]  Do you believe him?  Yeah, he's got no reason to lie.  All right.  Well, number one, I thought I'd bring it up because in case there's any developing news,  and number two, not everybody heard that part of today's show.  I didn't even see it, to tell you the truth.  I was driving and it was dark out.  I saw the radio car pull up.  I saw the cops get out and I just kept going.  And what was your quote?  Opie said something like,  Jesus, I think that was a dead body. 
[00:42:30]  And what did you say?  It happened.  Do you feel like your time on the force has just left you cold and barren?  I had a very fulfilling and enriching career.  But it's over now, isn't it?  Yeah, I'm a husband.  Did you get Jim that ginger ale he wanted?  I sure did.  That's what I do now.  I'm coffee boy.  How do you feel your missions today compared to your missions of yesterday?  Listen, I'm a very vital part of the organization. 
[00:43:00]  Of the O&A show?  Yeah, yeah.  How's that?  You can tell by all my Facebook followers.  Okay.  Enough about Facebook.  Kenny, we appreciate you calling in.  Well, you know, you've got some time to kill.  So do I when I'm driving.  I get bored.  I just call people.  Well, I don't have time to kill.  I'm trying to wrap you up.  All right.  Let Eric talk for a while.  Okay.  Thanks, Kenny. 
[00:43:30]  Thanks for the advice.  Oh, hey, listen.  I heard our Steven Singer commercial playing.  Yes, good.  All right.  I hope everybody else did, too.  Yeah, but I got to get, like, residuals for that or something.  Yeah, I think we all need to get some residuals for that.  We need to get residuals for a lot of stuff around here.  Yeah, that was, like, last Mother's Day.  I didn't say it's Mother's Day.  Kenny, why would you say, why would you break the illusion?  Now we're just going to have to record another one.  The illusion of what?  There's a Mother's Day every year.  That's no puzzle.  Can I move on with the show, please? 
[00:44:00]  It's up to you.  Thank you, Kenny.  I appreciate you calling in.  Where's Troy?  Troy, did you talk about his sore throat?  No.  All right.  Let Eric talk for a while.  All right.  I'll talk to you later, Kenny.  God bless.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Eric, I'm not really going to let you talk.  Is that okay?  That's fine.  I had a boss in here who insisted on talking to me.  Which boss was it?  The one that's stumbling around right now.  Rob Cross.  You can say his name.  He's an after-O&A celebrity.  He's stumbling around. 
[00:44:30]  He's walking a little, uh...  He looks like...  You know, like, if you're on a boat,  and it's really kind of just tossing.  Yeah.  But he just does that down a straight hallway.  Well, you could say Rob Cross's name.  He's an after-O&A live celebrity at this point.  He's been on the show a whole bunch of times.  But we've been talking about  the most annoying 30 seconds of sound.  Now, Kenny brought up Steven Singer  when he was on the phone just now.  Steven Singer, out of the goodness of his heart,  is giving one of you listeners $2,000 cash.  Now, you could pay it forward 
[00:45:00]  and just buy jewelry with it.  Or you could do something a little more sensible  and invest it.  You could do whatever you want.  It's your $2,000.  But first, you gotta win it.  And the only way to win it  is to enter the most annoying  30 seconds of sound contest.  All the rules are at  SiriusXM.com slash The Virus.  What if they did something really nice for us?  Like they bought us a present  or took us out to a nice dinner?  Yeah.  That's something you could do  with the $2,000.  We played...  I mean, I think it's a great idea, Eric. 
[00:45:30]  We played a sound  that was based on  Bob Kelly puking earlier.  This next one  is coming from  someone named  Aslan?  Is it...  Would you say that's pronounced  Aslan, the second one?  A-S-L-A-N?  Aslan, yeah.  Aslan, okay.  Aslan...  I'm not even gonna try the second name.  It's really not my job.  But this is not...  Again, these are not finalists.  These are just examples.  You can still enter the contest,  but you can only enter till Friday.  Send them in to  opianthony at SiriusXM.com. 
[00:46:00]  Here's another example  of an annoying  30 seconds of sound.  Put your hand on the edge of my cup. 
[00:46:30]  Jesus Christ.  I don't know what that last part added,  but Aslan, who submitted that  for the most annoying 30 seconds,  took a little more of a musical route.  I had no idea that Bob Kelly  was such a muse for our listeners.  E-Rock, are you jealous  that there aren't more...  There are a lot of Bob Kelly sounds  we're hearing.  Yesterday, we heard a Troy Kwan sound.  Not a lot of E-Rock sounds this time.  Nah, I haven't really been 
[00:47:00]  performing as well on the air.  I mean, they could take the sounds  of you getting waxed  and loop them together.  And, since we aired it on  Worst of Opie and Anthony,  I think technically it's show-related.  They could probably  do something with you  meowing on Jason Ellis' show.  Sure, why not?  Did he really kick you  in the legs that hard?  You said it was pulsating  when you came back to the office.  Yeah, my thigh was throbbing.  He came in, Jason Ellis, 
[00:47:30]  and he said that he didn't know  what you were so up in arms about  because he didn't do anything.  I wasn't up in arms.  I couldn't walk,  and I went to my office  and sat down.  But he said he's not hurt.  I barely even kicked him.  He's lying?  No, when he kicked me,  it was light,  but at one or two shots,  he got in a little too close,  and his knee went into my thigh  instead of his foot.  So that hurt even more.  And he got you in the gonads once,  correct?  Twice.  Ouch.  Well, I'm sure you'll hear that  sometime on...  We don't talk about 
[00:48:00]  getting hit in that area.  Why?  Because then you go on vacation.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Eric.  Maybe we'll play that soon.  We're not going to have time  to play the Scorch thing today,  so instead,  we'll try to get it in tomorrow  along with the intern David bit  to celebrate Passover.  Oh, my goodness.  No.  Not here.  Not like this.  Not today.  It's Ron Bennington  from the Ron and Fez show  and from the  Ronnie and Sammy Sweethearts  Variety Hour. 
[00:48:30]  Could you have  E-Rock start and toss me beers  as I'm coming through with that  so that I could pour it all over me?  Well, you've got to give him  one of these.  One of the stone call signs.  Give him one of these,  and then he'll just start  chucking beers.  But he puts that thing there  is to not let the audience  know what's coming next.  They have, like,  little signs back there.  Right, little hand signals.  Ron,  I listened to Ron and Fez yesterday,  and it was maybe,  you said,  you came on  the Opie and Anthony show,  and you said,  you were co-hosting,  you said,  I can't exist 
[00:49:00]  on this level  of uncomfortability.  Right.  Paul Reiser  was only in for 20 minutes.  Right.  Yesterday,  you spent two hours.  You know,  it's very funny  that a lot of people  wrote to me.  Did they?  Saying I thought  that you hated uncomfortability.  I thought Fez could pull it off.  I believed his cat,  I'm going to guess the name's Snooki,  I can't think of the real name,  was going to pull it off.  Today,  part two,  the cat talks.  It can't happen.  Fez has promised  that the cat would come back in.  Well,  here's what I said,  the cat's coming back in tomorrow.  He goes,  I don't think I can do it.  I go,  then call me tonight 
[00:49:30]  if you've got a better idea.  So,  the cat is in today.  So,  you spent two hours yesterday  trying to get Fez's cat  to say the word cookie.  It was so fucking close,  apparently.  Almost there.  Yeah.  I heard,  what was nice about,  it was like a rollercoaster ride.  There were,  there were,  you know,  hills and valleys  because at first it was like,  Fez was like,  this isn't even going to happen.  Right.  And then the cat would start  getting a little closer  and maybe,  maybe.  Right.  And then I guess time ran out.  Yeah,  unfortunately time ran out. 
[00:50:00]  That's why we're ready  to go with a part two.  Two today.  Very,  very exciting show.  Well,  I'm so glad because,  I mean,  I was in,  I even stopped by a couple times.  I went into the phone screening booth  because I said,  I got to see this.  Go on.  Right.  It's Fez and a cat  and you  and then Chris Stanley  with the video camera.  By the way,  always feel free to stone cold  your way into this  if you need to.  Just go.  I didn't want to,  stone cold.  I didn't want to disrupt the cat  is the only thing.  I know,  it was so close.  That cat is fragile.  But today's the day  I feel really,  really good about it.  Yeah,  it's going to happen.  I think it can kind of talk  a little bit anyway. 
[00:50:30]  Cookie.  Cookie.  Cookie.  Cookie.  Fez was amazing  how he was able to  improvise his way  in and out of that storyline.  That's why it never got flat.  His ability  as an improvisational actor  took you on a journey.  Based on what I was listening to yesterday,  the one thing I'll say about Fez  is persistence above all else.  Right.  I mean,  no quit in him  because you said,  do you want to quit?  And every time you said,  no,  no fucking way.  This cat's going to say cookie today. 
[00:51:00]  And if not,  he's going off the George Washington Bridge.  It was very funny too.  My emails track  a very great thing of,  hey,  this is so funny.  Stop it.  Worst show ever.  Into,  this is so funny.  Hills and valleys.  Yeah,  it started to come back up again  where people are going,  all right,  you're brilliant.  And does Fez see the metaphor?  Does Fez know  that he's playing the part of Ron today?  And the cat is playing the part of Fez?  And I,  that's why I think today will be the day. 
[00:51:30]  And I'm amazed  that he's going to do it two days in a row.  I didn't think he would do it two days in a row.  It's persistence.  All night long,  I'm saying,  I'm going to wait,  you know,  for the phone to ring.  I said to my chick,  I go,  well,  Fez calls,  let me know.  No.  He's going to do part two.  And I'm fucking blown away by it.  I like that you can come on,  uh,  Ronnie and Sammy's Sweethearts,  though,  and just go literal with it.  Just explain.  Here's the metaphor.  This is what's going on.  It's like that backstage thing  that they do after Jersey Shore. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah,  this is,  this is the after show,  but,  and we're bleeding right in.  By the way,  coming up a little later on,  one of your favorite people in the world,  Phil Rosenthal,  he's the person who created the television show,  Everybody Loves Raymond.  They took it to Russia,  and they got it,  a Russian,  kind of like,  Everybody Loves Boris.  Oh,  Roland was telling us about that,  about how hilarious the whole,  it's insane.  Yeah.  It's absolutely insane.  Yeah,  and is it a book or documentary?  It's a rockumentary.  Okay.  Where they sing,  it's kind of like Glee. 
[00:52:30]  I got you.  I got you.  I mean,  it's a hit.  Did you,  did you hear the Mob Wives on O&A today?  No,  I heard about it though,  it was on my way in.  Sammy the Bull's daughter.  Yeah.  Said,  can I talk for a second?  And Ant goes,  yeah,  of course you can,  your dad sure did.  It was an uncomfortable moment.  Did she get mad about that?  She did.  That was the one,  that was the one moment she was like,  well,  we really don't talk about my dad that way.  Because I remember when Gotti's daughter was in,  they were very,  very respectful.  Yeah,  they loved her.  The boys were incredibly respectful,  yeah.  And I, 
[00:53:00]  yeah,  I do think there was like a little crush thing.  I could tell when they think a woman is attractive,  but not somebody who's like,  hey,  let's use you as a spittoon.  Well,  they'll really think like,  hey,  this is someone I could do well with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean,  you knew that she was good looking because they blew off Mike Rowe.  And that was the last time Mike Rowe did the show.  Major mistakes.  He's got commercials going on right now.  He probably could have gotten us a truck or something.  A fleet.  Well,  we'll let you get into the Phil Rosenthal and Fez's catch. 
[00:53:30]  I'm very,  very excited today.  If you want to talk to Cookie,  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ,  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  First time in the history of radio a cat takes phone calls.  Who's on the hotline right now?  Is that for us or Ron and Fez?  I'm finding out.  Hang on.  Okay.  Yeah,  take your time.  There's plenty of time.  We're in between.  You know,  I mean,  we're bleeding into your time.  I got no problem.  It's all,  it's all the same.  Now,  your partner,  your Saturday night.  Eastside Dave.  You've got so many partners now. 
[00:54:00]  And no one knows where you're going.  That's why no one trusts you.  Well,  fair enough.  Text me.  He puts in a bet.  I don't know.  He's treating me like I'm a bookie.  And he's got,  he puts up,  he wants Boston and five and under 15 bucks.  15,  $15.  Dave is the,  as much as he knows about sports,  he's a sports genius.  He's the worst at picking.  Like he's,  his,  his,  his,  his,  his,  his brackets are always totally wrong.  Yeah.  His,  his bets are always off. 
[00:54:30]  Well,  by sports genius,  he,  he listens to fan.  That's it.  And then he repeats what they say on the podcast.  But loudly.  With a little more cursing.  You know,  that's the thing,  like sports fans can be so loud that you're like,  okay,  I guess so.  I guess they should have made that trade.  But I thought it was an odd thing.  He's betting against the Knicks.  Yeah.  He's against his own team.  He's using,  he's saying,  what he thinks,  not what he hopes.  It's odd though.  It's just like the most anti-New York thing in the world or South Jersey.  Like where Dave's from.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:55:00]  So I'm starting a,  I know he's a Nets fan.  Oh,  so he doesn't like the Knicks.  Dave,  I know he's a Nets fan.  I'm assuming that it must mean he doesn't like the Knicks.  Brooklyn Nets.  Yeah,  I guess he doesn't.  But,  uh,  he had locked in with the,  uh,  what he said was either this thing is going to go seven games or a sweep.  Okay.  And then he writes back,  15 bucks,  five and under.  And I just expect him locked in.  As if,  I'm like,  why is he treating me like I'm a bookie?  Yeah,  you're there.  You're handling all the bets.  I can take an action from everybody. 
[00:55:30]  You're the $15 bookie too.  Yeah.  $15 bets from Ronnie B.  It really is like the fucking nickel slots of gambling.  Well,  we're way over.  So we'll let you start your show.  You got all this stuff planned.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  You don't want to miss it.  Cookie speaks.  Cookie speaks.  Today on Ron and Fez.
