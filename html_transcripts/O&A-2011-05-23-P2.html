<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, on Opie's birthday, saw Sam Roberts filling in for the absent host.  The show opened with a discussion about the impact of Opie's absence on Club Soda Kenny, his driver.  Kenny's atypical early arrival and strange behavior, including following Sam to the bathroom, were attributed by Sam to constipation potentially caused by the disrupted schedule.  Kenny later called in, confirming the constipation but blaming a steak eaten two days prior in a tribute to the recently deceased Macho Man Randy Savage.  He justified his early arrival by claiming a high-paying, life-saving job and discussed his Facebook interactions, particularly his unfriending of E-Rock due to excessive self-promotion.

The main segment revolved around a birthday prank for Opie: a revisit of the "baby diaper mustache" bit.  Rich Voss unexpectedly arrived with a used baby diaper, fulfilling a prior challenge.  Voss proceeded to apply the diaper's contents to Opie's face as a mustache, resulting in Opie's repeated vomiting and profuse expressions of disgust.  The segment involved graphic descriptions of feces and vomit.  Following this, the show discussed the death of Macho Man Randy Savage, with Sam, E-Rock, and Troy sharing memories and opinions.  E-Rock's intense wrestling fandom and sometimes inaccurate predictions were also discussed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live, I'm Sam Roberts.  Anthony, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, they all went home.  It was a fabulous show today, full of laughs.  If you missed any of it, I would highly suggest listening to the replay 
[00:00:30]  because you're not going to want to miss a minute.  But Opie, obviously not here, as today is Opie's birthday.  E-Rock, are you doing anything to celebrate with Opie?  No, I am not.  That's not a surprise, given what's gone on.  But Opie not here today. He stayed home to celebrate his birthday.  And the one person who, it wasn't mentioned on the air today,  who was affected, I think, the most by Opie not being here,  was not Anthony, his co-host.  Anthony managed to pull himself up by his bootstraps 
[00:01:00]  and go through with a memorable, hilarious, entertaining, and wonderful show.  Club Soda Kenny was the guy who was completely affected by this.  Kenny was walking around like a dog without an owner today.  And I know that he's here for the whole show,  but he was walking around like he was lost,  like he didn't know where to go.  So what his usual routine is that he wakes up in the morning,  he drives from his place in Jersey,  he picks up Opie on the way, 
[00:01:30]  and then he gets here and he starts, you know,  fulfilling the needs that Opie,  and then once Anthony gets here, Anthony have.  And then Jim, too, once Jim gets here.  Today, however,  and Kenny is a creature of habit.  I mean, he's very OCD,  and he likes his things to be a certain way.  He gets here today,  and since he didn't have to pick up Opie this morning,  since he took the show off,  he's just wandering around at 5.30 in the morning.  Just wandering around the floor looking for something to do. 
[00:02:00]  I guess he didn't realize that everybody else would be busy,  because Kenny was not.  I mean,  I know that he's attached to his, uh,  his, whatever,  his, his  regularities,  but this is ridiculous.  Then,  once the show started,  uh,  he was following me to the bathroom when I went,  as if I needed protection,  and,  and I'll tell you this in confidence,  E-Rock,  I don't want you repeating this,  because he may be embarrassed by it, 
[00:02:30]  Kenny was constipated today.  And I think that has a lot to do with the fact that  his job was not what it usually is.  Um,  E-Rock,  I know when you,  when things change for you,  you tend to get a little backed up,  correct?  No, that's not true at all.  Then where did I get that information?  Oh,  you made it up,  like you do everything else.  Oh,  well,  this I didn't make up.  I was in the bathroom with Kenny,  and Troy could actually back me up on that,  because he,  he heard him say it,  Kenny was constipated today,  and I think  that it had a lot to do with,  uh,  with him 
[00:03:00]  and his job descriptions changing.  Speak of the devil.  I think that's him.  It's like you put out the bat signal.  Uh,  Club Soda Kenny,  is this you?  Yes,  it's me.  How are you doing,  Kenny?  I mean,  I was just telling the audience,  uh,  that today was an off day for you,  because you're,  you're,  there were changes in your schedule.  Well,  I heard what you said.  You thought my XM radio was still turned off,  but it's turned back on.  Oh no,  Kenny,  oh no! 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  So,  I'm not embarrassed that I'm constipated.  Well,  that's good.  You shouldn't be.  It's a natural process.  You know,  you know what an accountant does when he's constipated?  What's that Club Soda Kenny?  She works it out with a pencil.  That's disgusting.  That is absolutely disgusting.  Uh,  Kenny,  do,  your constipation problems,  were they mainly due to the fact that Opie wasn't here,  and thus your schedule changed? 
[00:04:00]  No,  it's because I ate a steak Saturday night.  Saturday night?  That was like,  Yeah.  Two days ago.  It's still stuck in you?  Yeah,  but it was in honor of a dead wrestler.  Macho Man Randy Savage.  Yeah,  because he likes Slim Jim's.  Well,  that's very,  uh,  that's very kind of you,  Kenny.  Uh,  do you feel like you're a lost puppy when you're here without Opie?  Because you get here in the morning,  and you just wander around. 
[00:04:30]  There was no reason for you to be here as early as you were here.  Sure,  I was making my security rounds.  But there was none of,  the talent wasn't here yet.  Why would you be here 20 minutes before the talent gets here?  I get paid to be there.  You do?  Yeah,  they pay me a lot of money.  What for?  I have the hardest job there.  Staying awake?  No,  I'm responsible to save lives.  Yeah,  but Opie wasn't here, 
[00:05:00]  thus changing your schedule.  Usually you drive Opie in,  so one would think that since you didn't have to drive Opie in,  you would just get here once Anthony and Jim got here.  But no,  you still got here at your regular time.  Happy birthday,  GH.  I hope you're having a nice day.  I hope he's at home listening.  Yeah,  you didn't wish him happy birthday.  Well,  happy birthday.  I was going to.  I haven't worked out here what I'm planning on doing this morning. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm glad my constipation was on the top of your list.  Well,  I had to start with something,  Kenny,  and this is something that the people who listened to the entire show today wouldn't have been aware of.  Well,  it is topical since it is the shit hour.  Good one,  Kenny.  That was solid.  Did you watch the Billboard Awards last night?  I didn't even know it was on.  I went to sleep.  You didn't watch anything?  No,  I watched,  uh,  like,  60 minutes. 
[00:06:00]  I turned it on,  but who gives a fuck about Lance Armstrong?  Uh,  16 minutes?  You mean 60 minutes?  Yeah,  that show that comes on Sunday night?  Yeah,  I got it.  60 minutes.  All right,  Kenny,  well,  uh,  hopefully tomorrow,  Opie will be back,  and you can get back to your regular schedule,  and,  uh,  your regular bowel movements.  Yeah.  By the way,  do you have a weather report for us?  It's overcast in New York City. 
[00:06:30]  Anywhere else,  or?  I'm not there.  I'm only in one person,  one place,  at one time.  Okay,  traffic report,  then.  Some,  some report on the traffic.  It's clear sailing where I am.  Which is where?  I'm going across town.  Okay,  how about on another part of the town,  or in another city?  Good luck.  All right,  thanks a lot,  Club Soda.  Wait,  what are you going to talk about next?  Well,  uh,  we got a couple of things to play.  I wanted to play an Opie bit, 
[00:07:00]  in honor of Opie's birthday.  Which one?  I was thinking,  uh,  baby diaper mustache.  Yeah,  but nobody likes when you play clips.  They like when you talk.  I hear mixed things.  I hear some people say that,  and other people say,  we need some Opie and Anthony thrown in there.  Hey,  Sam,  did you hear the news?  What's that?  I broke 3,000 likes on my Facebook page,  Club Soda Canyon.  I know,  because you're plugging and pandering, 
[00:07:30]  like you always do.  You started a Facebook topic,  which was just devoted to your number of followers.  It's getting,  it's to the point,  you're not doing anything on Facebook.  Yeah,  I'm,  I'm entertaining.  No,  you're not.  You have the most boring Facebook profile of anyone on the staff.  Yeah,  then how come so many people comment?  I don't know,  Kenny.  That is,  that is a question I do not know the answer to.  Yeah,  even you were compelled to comment.  Well,  I just simply wrote that you were pandering with your dumb comment about 3,000 people. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah,  and you used that word out of context.  No,  it was in context.  You'll,  you'll see how many people write on my wall now about you.  Well,  they can write on my wall too.  No,  write on mine.  Write on whichever wall you want.  Thank you so much,  Club Soda Kenny.  All right,  thank you for taking my phone call and speaking with me.  Have a nice day anyway.  And thank you,  Sirius XM,  for refreshing my radio. 
[00:08:30]  I'm starting to think that you're just pushing your own personal agenda here,  Club Soda.  No,  I was,  I was with an upset light radio all weekend.  You know how bad that was?  No,  I keep my radios refreshed at all times.  Well,  I didn't,  I,  I,  I had nothing to do with it.  All right,  Kenny,  goodbye.  Goodbye.  That was Club Soda Kenny talking about his day.  E-Rock,  did you train over the weekend?  Nope.  Yeah,  I bet you,  I bet you trained a little bit.  Not at all.  Tell me this, 
[00:09:00]  before we get into this Opie bit,  Eastside Dave told me on special delivery on Saturday night,  you defriended him on Facebook.  Yes.  Why is that?  Because I was tired of the constant plugs for,  uh,  Eastside Dave country.  He feels like,  uh,  you defriended him and you're just checking out his wife's Facebook now.  No,  she,  she doesn't plug.  Oh,  so you defriended him because of the constant plugs.  Yeah.  I do enjoy Dave's videos, 
[00:09:30]  but it was just constant Eastside Dave country.  I was just like,  all right,  enough.  All right.  Well,  E-Rock,  it is Opie's birthday and we want to wish a sincere happy birthday to Opie,  uh,  Opie Radio on Twitter,  Opie Radio on YouTube,  Opie Radio fans on Facebook.  That's the different one.  Uh,  and yeah,  as much as club Soda Kenny talks about it,  let's face it.  Opie Radio fans on Facebook is a lot more entertaining than whatever dumb club Soda Kenny is doing.  Uh, 
[00:10:00]  but this,  uh,  to me,  Voss was in studio today.  And as we celebrate the life of Greg Opie Hughes,  it is his birthday.  And we think back on the great moments that he's brought the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh,  there was one day when he went on the air and said,  if by the end of the day somebody brings me a used baby diaper with shit in the diaper,  or no,  a baby who has shit its diaper, 
[00:10:30]  I will take that shit and wear it as a mustache.  E-Rock,  you decided to take it upon yourself to call Rich Voss that day.  Yes,  I knew,  uh,  I knew Rich was in the city.  He wasn't that far.  And I knew he was in with his family.  Rich didn't bring in a baby.  But he certainly brought the diaper in.  Without further ado,  ladies and gentlemen,  in honor of Opie's birthday,  this is the baby diaper mustache on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:11:00]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh,  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is he doing here?  Oh my God,  please.  He didn't,  he didn't,  he didn't,  Oh no!  All right,  I know what the fuck he did.  I know what the fuck he did.  My heart just stopped.  Yes,  and it should.  You don't have a kid with you,  do you?  What's that?  Do you have Bonnie and the baby?  First of all,  I always have a heart of Bonnie and the baby with me,  whether they're here or not.  Okay?  So what are you saying?  Do I have Bonnie?  Do you see Bonnie with me still?  Do you understand?  I would love fucking,  You have no idea.  Do you understand?  What?  I just surprised people out of nowhere. 
[00:11:30]  It turns into baby diaper mustache day.  Today happens to be one of those days.  And the odds of it actually happening are slim.  But when we saw your face at the door,  I'm like,  Oh my fucking God.  Yeah,  because he's somebody that would have been listening.  Because you have stopped by with the baby too before.  You know,  here's the thing though.  I mean,  there's so many rules to this thing,  you know.  The bottom line is,  you would take baby shit  and put it under here.  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  You'd make a little mustache with baby shit.  Oh my God. 
[00:12:00]  Bobby's puking.  You fuck me.  Oh God damn it. 
[00:12:30]  Oh fucking Bobby's got the weakest.  Oh Bobby's got the weakest stomach.  Does your baby have pus come out of its asshole?  You think it'd be thinner  or he throws up so much?  Nice laugh.  If you could do that after each meal,  you'd maybe lose a few pounds.  Holy Jesus.  I don't care.  I'll fucking puke. 
[00:13:00]  I want to see it on his lap.  Fuck all of you all.  It's baby shit fucking Friday.  Dude,  Opie did,  it's like,  the plane landed  and everybody started to clap  and then it fucking rolled over  and exploded.  That's exactly it.  This is the best day of radio ever.  Who fucking called you?  Because the beauty of this bit  is I go,  Steve,  make the problem.  I'm doing baby diaper mustache.  Don't tell anyone.  And then,  wait,  Sam,  then I play the thing 
[00:13:30]  and no one has enough time  to come over here.  So someone obviously called you  and said,  get your ass into New York  with some fucking baby shit.  Well,  here's the thing.  No one,  Eric's idea.  No,  whoa,  whoa,  whoa.  Oh,  wow.  No one called me.  I had to come in anyhow  for some promos  and I always keep  a dirty diaper with me  just in case  it's an emergency.  Bobby can't take it.  Bobby can't take it.  I just don't understand  why it's green  and white.  Yeah,  why is it?  Why the multicolored?  What do you feed your baby? 
[00:14:00]  Oh,  God,  he touches it.  Oh,  he's touching it,  Bobby.  Look at his ass crack  hanging out.  He's got his ass crack  hanging out  as he's puking.  Oh,  fuck.  Pull your pants up,  you mess.  What a disaster you are.  I'm a disaster.  Look at both of you.  Fucking Laszlo  and both of you.  What?  Fucking awful.  I don't need gloves.  Fucking stock car racing bodies.  I'm sick of both of you. 
[00:14:30]  You really are,  you thin assholes.  Yeah.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Yeah,  yeah,  pitted.  So pitted.  Here we go.  Well,  here,  let's,  here we go.  Oh.  Yeah,  you can't.  Dude.  You're not using this  on anything,  this newspaper?  No.  Oh,  no.  Oh,  my God.  Oh,  you fucking asshole.  You just set yourself up  using this newspaper.  Oh,  God.  All right.  Oh.  Oh,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah, 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  What are the odds  that I got to set you guys up?  Oh,  shit.  Oh,  my God.  He's putting on surgical gloves.  Why are you putting on surgical gloves?  So he can handle  What's wrong with your baby?  What's wrong with her?  He can handle the diaper.  Nothing.  I want to just fiddle through this myself.  Let's go.  Let's make a nice Yosemite sand.  Holy shit.  I just got my first whip.  Oh,  oh.  Dude,  disgusting.  You gotta bring it.  Oh,  I can't bring this to you, kid.  How do you have a kid?  It's your kid. 
[00:15:30]  How do you change it and puke?  Why is this affecting you?  It's your baby shit.  Yeah.  It's different when I'm...  When it's coming out of its asshole?  Yeah,  when I have clothes on.  Dave from Massachusetts.  Dave from Massachusetts.  To add insult to injury.  To add insult to baby shit injury,  Opie has to live with the fact that he got outsmarted by Voss.  That's true.  That is bad.  I love how diapers have cute little cartoon animals on them  because once they're used,  then they're just smeared with shit.  That looks like cute animals that got shit on. 
[00:16:00]  They put that on there to make you feel guilty  for what you're about to do.  You got gloves?  Yeah,  right here.  I gotta go.  Why do you need gloves?  You're about to put shit on your face  and you're going to put plastic gloves on?  Oh my God.  I am so puking.  And I don't...  It takes a lot for me to puke.  I see sometimes babies...  Fucking fair.  Sometimes babies don't go to the bathroom  for a whole day at a time.  So this could be like built up.  This is like a couple days of crap.  All right.  Let me see what you got.  It's not fair though. 
[00:16:30]  They set me up.  They know why I do this bit.  It's all about the timing of the thing.  Yeah.  This was never supposed to go down.  No.  Oh my God.  Just staring at shit  sitting in a chair on a newspaper.  The quicker you do it,  the quicker it's over.  Do you have baby wipes right near you?  Help.  You need baby wipes.  You can't just leave it on your face after that.  Where is the diaper?  It's on the chair.  Is it in the chair?  Here we go.  You got to face forward a little bit.  Here we go.  Hold your breath.  Okay.  Don't smell.  There you are.  Don't smell.  It's not a big deal. 
[00:17:00]  It's like food only,  you know,  in the second stage.  And it came out of  Voss's kid's asshole.  Food in the second stage  is called shit, Rich.  What's the good part?  What's the good part?  The green part.  You're not Bobby Kelly.  He's on fire.  You got to give it to him.  That's pretty good.  But you know it's coming.  He's going to bomb any second now.  You know it's happening.  How the fuck am I going to do this?  You're going to stick your fingers in there  and do it quick.  It's a Sesame Street diaper.  It's a cookie monster. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What do you want on a diaper?  Look at that part.  It's so fucking funny.  Ray's on the golf course.  It's unbelievable.  You can take an eight-inch cock  in your mouth,  but look at that 
[00:18:00]  and you're puking like a maniac.  Eight-inch cock is fucking soft  and smells nice.  Let's clean up for you.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Okay, I saved you.  Hurry up.  I've got to get your diaper back.  All right.  What are we going for?  I say a big wad on your finger.  I didn't fucking shave today either.  God damn it.  Oh, man.  It's going to be stuck in there.  I've got to go.  What do you got an audition for?  I'm fucking.  I don't care.  Fucking go. 
[00:18:30]  It's not.  It's a callback.  Cool.  I know you've never heard of one of those.  Oh, shit.  Definitely not with a girl, is it?  Yes, I knew it.  I'm going to come.  See you, Bob.  You're really just a fucking greedy asshole.  You really are.  You and your fucking extra large polo shirt.  Just do it, O.  Do it.  Man up.  Ready?  Here we go.  Two fingers, each side.  Fucking nice little mustache.  Oh, my God, no.  One, two, three.  Ready?  This is so fucking disgusting.  One, two, three. 
[00:19:00]  This is a new law.  Do it.  A new fucking law.  Travis, move your head.  Do it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Travis.  One, two.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is called baby diaper mustache.  Oh, God.  One, two, three.  Do two fingers at a time.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  He's got it on his finger.  He's got some.  He's smearing.  He's got. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, no.  Oh.  I see YouTube sensation right now.  This is going to be a YouTube sensation.  Can you say RobertKelleyLive.com right after you do it?  That is fucking disgusting.  All right.  This is called.  Oh, it stinks.  Once again, this is called baby diaper mustache.  One, two, three.  One, two, three. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  One, two, three, dude.  Oh, babe.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I've got to get it off.  He fell on the floor. 
[00:20:30]  He fell on the floor.  He did it.  He took two fingers.  Wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's got the diaper in his hand.  Where is he?  He's going home.  All right.  He's running off to the bathroom.  Holy shit. 
[00:21:00]  What a fucking prop act.  I'll see you guys later.  Take it easy, Bobby.  Thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  He's got tears.  I fucking love you.  I fucking love you.  I really didn't think he'd do that.  I fucking love Laz.  I'll see you later.  I did not think he would do that.  This is the best show I've ever fucking done, ever.  I'll see you guys.  I'm going to puke.  Because Opie's rarely on the receiving end of any of that stuff.  Literally, that shit.  And to see him... 
[00:21:30]  Actually, he took two fingers full on his index fingers and smeared it right under his nose.  And the worst part is he hesitated.  He held his fingers right under his nose for a minute.  Yeah.  And then kept going back and forth with him.  And then after he finished throwing up, he tried to wipe it off.  And then he just had green shit spread across him.  And it went on his lip.  Like, now it was so close to his mouth.  And it was a big wad.  It wasn't just like...  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, that shit is green.  That baby shit was green. 
[00:22:00]  Alien fucking green.  You guys called me one day and said you...  Oh, what a picture.  That's it.  E-Rock's showing me a still picture.  Opie's horrified and just got baby shit smeared all under his nose.  I am so disgusted.  A new low.  A brand new low on the Opie and Anthony show.  I didn't think it could be done.  After ONA Live.  And now he's got a baby of his own.  This is after Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And that, in honor of the great Greg Opie Hughes' birthday, which is today, was baby diaper mustache. 
[00:22:30]  One of the finer moments in the history of Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  It was absolutely one of the most disgusting things that have ever taken place.  Not the most, probably.  But I would rank it in the top five most disgusting things.  Would you put it there, Eric?  Yeah, it's up there.  But a lot of our disgusting things involve shit.  Yeah, the Tippy Tom thing was probably more disgusting. 
[00:23:00]  There was that.  But that also, the Tippy Tom underwear tied into brushing your teeth with it, right?  Brushing your teeth with dog excrement.  All right, so that's another thing.  You think that's more disgusting than wearing baby excrement?  Brushing your teeth with it, yes.  Yeah, I guess, because then you've got to get it in your mouth and all over the...  I guess this really is the shit hour this morning.  Yes, and our least offensive shit bit, I think, is Big Boy Makes a Duty.  Well, yeah, I mean, because Jared, the fish boy, Cream Pie Jones deserved it. 
[00:23:30]  All this stuff, if you search around YouTube, you can find it.  I don't think it's on any of the official channels anymore, but if you search around, you can find videos of all this stuff.  Though I don't really know why you would.  Listening to it is bad enough.  E-Rock, while that was playing, actually, before I talked to you, I saw Jim walking around the hallways.  I don't know what he was doing here late.  Probably trying to apologize to people, because there's nothing better than hearing one of the guys go off on a rant on the show, on the air, 
[00:24:00]  and then maybe 20 minutes later, they have to apologize, because they jumped headfirst into something that they didn't necessarily have all the information on.  That scenario happened to Jim a little earlier on this morning, so if you didn't hear it, you've got to catch the replay,  because there's nothing better than seeing Opie, Anthony, or Jim with their foot in dung.  Now, what were you going to say, Eurek?  Nothing, I'm listening to you.  Oh, I thought you had your mouth open and just hungry a little bit? 
[00:24:30]  No, yawning.  Oh, I knew it was one of the two.  We talked...  Go ahead.  I wasn't saying anything to you.  You were about to say something that time.  No, I was clearing my throat.  Getting ready.  We talked about it a little bit today, the death of the Macho Man Randy Savage.  To me, and I mentioned a little bit of this on Special Delivery, he was my absolute favorite as a kid.  Oh, you had the bed all queued up, huh?  This might be the first bed we've ever played on after ONA, isn't it? 
[00:25:00]  Probably.  He was my first favorite wrestler.  And probably the most meaningful, because, you know, throughout my whole childhood, he was my favorite pro wrestler.  And, I mean, to this day, it's hard to argue that he was the best.  My favorite moment of the month.  And I know, I would love to hear what Danny's favorite Macho Man moment was, because I was surprised when I got in this morning that Danny said that this sucks.  Because Danny has never said that about any of the wrestlers who have died, but he was kind of bummed out that the Macho Man had died. 
[00:25:30]  So if he's listening in the office right now, he can come down and share if he pleases.  But a lot of people say WrestleMania 3 is the best Macho Man moment.  Uh-uh.  To me, WrestleMania 7 is the best Macho Man moment.  Really?  Seeing the Macho Man carry the Ultimate Warrior through a great match.  Anybody can have a great match with Ricky the Dragon Steamboat.  He's a great wrestler.  But seeing the Macho Man and the Ultimate Warrior compete in a career-ending match, which turned out to be one of the best in both their careers. 
[00:26:00]  To get that out of the Ultimate Warrior and to have the kind of human drama that was associated with that match is something that doesn't happen very much in wrestling, especially not anymore.  Even Troy was bummed out about the Macho Man dying, which I have no idea what he's basing that on, since the only wrestling knowledge that he has is associated with the Rockers and the Bushwhackers.  But, Eric, you are somebody—and again, he can come down. 
[00:26:30]  If he has any Macho Man memories, he can share, too.  Any of you can, if you're listening back there in the offices.  Um, Eric, you—well, let's get to Troy, because I want to save you, Eric, because you—I want to talk about some of the wrestling theories and predictions that you have as well, because they're always so terrible.  You were—Troy bummed out about Macho Man?  Yeah, you were the one that gave me the news.  Yeah, I know, but—  That was—that just—that sucked, dude.  Why—what about—what Macho Man memories do you have?  I mean, you've always said that wrestling is stupid.  It was, but, you know, when you're a kid and you're growing up and, you know, wrestling is everything to you. 
[00:27:00]  See, I stopped liking wrestling about 1990.  Okay.  Where some people kept going after they knew it was fake.  I thought it was real up to that point.  Oh, so you were like a little retarded kid.  You knew when you were a little kid that it was fake?  I had an understanding of the business in an early age.  Well, whatever.  But anyway, Macho Man was always kind of like—  What are you shaking your head at, Nagel?  That's funny.  Oh, thank you.  He was the bad guy, but yet he was a good guy. 
[00:27:30]  He didn't know.  Yeah.  He was unpredictable.  Yeah, and he really sold it.  He made it seem real.  Like, he was really pissed off.  He was crazy.  Yes.  Like, you wouldn't want to cross him.  Yeah.  He was schizophrenic.  Yeah.  Where he was, like, real calm.  And then he would just sneak up and scream at you!  And you always liked that.  Is that where you learned some of your sort of arguing technique from?  A little bit, yes.  A little bit of—I could see a little Randy Savage in your classic fight with Danny.  Yeah.  A little Macho Man was channeled there.  Of course, my inner Macho Man came out.  But you don't remember enough to have any favorite opponents or anything that you like 
[00:28:00]  to see the Macho Man with.  Well, he went against Hulk Hogan.  You liked that?  Yeah.  Well, that was a big deal, because it was like, wow, these two are going at it.  Right.  And then, of course, you know, Miss Elizabeth, you know, she was at his side, and she was  beautiful, and, you know—  Of course.  It was just such a juxtaposition, wasn't it?  It was.  And it was just—it was the whole package.  You know what I mean?  Eric, I thought—Troy, you know, E-Rock is a giant wrestling fan.  And Anthony really described it well on the show today, where he said, I'm a bigger wrestling  fan than E-Rock, but it's also—we view it in two separate ways. 
[00:28:30]  Like, I view it in terms of just an extremely deep appreciation for the business and everything  around it.  On every level, I appreciate everything that's going on.  Whereas E-Rock does still have that childlike mentality of the way you watched in 1989 is  the way E-Rock would still watch today.  As a 33-year-old man.  That's how you see E-Rock, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's pretty accurate, right, Eric?  Because I enjoy watching it for entertainment, where you try to make every aspect of it your 
[00:29:00]  life.  No, because you still, like, you know, wear the John Cena hat when you're at home on your  couch, like, saying, you can't see me.  No, I do not.  And you want to see The Miz go down hard because of the things he said.  And he's rooting for the match, but it's all predetermined, and it's, you know, he's  bummed out when it doesn't happen.  It's like, well, the writers had written it that way.  Like, he hates to see the bad guys win.  Right.  Because he's like, how did that—how did his villainous ways pay off?  There's a picture, actually, by my desk that somebody printed out for me—it might 
[00:29:30]  have even been you—where Eric has the belt, and he has it around his shoulder.  We did.  Back when I was doing Backstage with ONA, remember the Backstage reports that I did?  I remember doing a report where, E-Rock, you were walking around the office with a million-dollar  championship belt on.  Oh, hell yeah.  Showing it off to all the girls.  It ruled.  You remember, he was showing the belt off to all the girls.  He was really proud.  And what would happen is he'd walk up to all the girls who worked here, and he'd show  them the belt.  Like, they didn't ask to see it.  He walked over to them and showed them, and they'd kind of go, yeah, that's really cool, 
[00:30:00]  ha ha.  And then he'd walk away, and the girls would look at me or you and get the eye roll.  Like, what is he doing?  Meanwhile, their pussy dries up like the Sahara.  Right.  With him walking around like that.  Well, we don't need, you know, a walking Toys R Us to, you know—E-Rock, did you get  that vibe?  No.  Jealous.  Jealous.  Jealous.  Jealous.  So, I talk to E-Rock sometimes and get his wrestling predictions.  Like, I say, you know, after a big event, like after the Royal Rumble or something, I'd  say, okay, so everything was set in motion at the Royal Rumble. 
[00:30:30]  Where do you think this goes?  And I listen as in these childlike, no sense of, this is a business, this has to go somewhere.  It's all just his predictions, quote-unquote, are just things that he thinks would be cool  and don't make any sense.  And I like how Sam's, like, getting on my case for this shit for an industry that neither  one of us work in, but I'm enjoying it from an entertainment point of view, and he's getting  mad at me because I'm not taking it seriously.  Well, he doesn't have an understanding at his age.  Don't you think if he's watching it, he should have some kind of understanding of the business? 
[00:31:00]  Like, if you were predicting—if you were watching a television show, and you were predicting  where do the characters on the TV show go next, you wouldn't just think of crazy things  that nobody would watch that would just be funny to you.  You would think of, where does this show go that it makes sense?  Right, but if you know and you see the people that are in their 30s and plus who are still  enjoying this as an entertainment form, he fits into that demo perfectly.  Perfectly.  So it all really makes sense. 
[00:31:30]  He really is just a mark.  He's exactly who they're selling to.  Exactly.  You know?  I mean, it's poster boy right there.  That said, I've been dying to get this.  We were talking about our favorite Macho Man moments.  Guys, I think this is going to work for me, because I haven't asked Eric, but I would  like to know, based on the fact that E-Rock is a super fan, he's been watching wrestling  all his life, and he just said on the show today that he is a big Macho Man fan.  He did a great impression.  E-Rock, number one Macho Man moment of all time. 
[00:32:00]  WrestleMania 4.  The tournament?  Yep.  That was the number one?  I was there.  I enjoyed it.  See, that's...  But look at his career, not just what moment were you at.  You asked what mine was, not what the industry or anybody else thinks was his best moment.  No, no, no.  What is the best moment of his career, not what moment of his career were you at?  Fuck that.  I like that moment.  He got the title for the first time.  Do you know who he beat?  Yeah.  Who? 
[00:32:30]  DiBiase.  You didn't really remember, though, did you?  You weren't sure.  Because I was trying to remember the outcome, because it was a bunch of cheating going on.  He doesn't remember.  The greatest moment in the history of the Macho Man.  Again, I'm going to look down because I'm not into...  And you don't remember.  I'm not nerding it up on wrestling.  You don't remember the moment.  The end of the tournament, WrestleMania 4, Hogan and Andre were interfering.  Troy gave me more specifics.  Who fucking cares?  He's not a fan.  No shit.  I did see Macho Man live, though. 
[00:33:00]  You did?  Yes, they did.  They played the Allentown Center there, where they did live wrestling.  Well, it's no surprise to me that Iraq failed at just naming what his favorite moment was,  because he fails at everything.  I discussed this last week.  He's going to fail this Friday, when it comes to the physical fitness challenge.  No one cares.  You're not physically fit.  You care, Eric, and you're masking it.  No one cares.  You're masking the fact that you care.  You're the one who's fake bullshitting. 
[00:33:30]  You're going to lose.  Posturing that you're going to win.  I am going to win.  All this other crap.  And you're going to lose.  Who cares?  He's setting himself up for when he does lose.  He will care.  He does care.  He does.  But when it comes down to it, he's setting himself up so when he loses, it's like,  oh, see, I didn't give a shit anyway.  Now you care, too?  I care because I'm going to win 50 bucks.  Yeah.  He knows he's going to lose.  He just wants an excuse.  And with that, we close after Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony Show is now over.
