<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the show's controversial nature and the perceived expectation of radio to be "nice."  The hosts then transitioned to complaining about their exhaustion from the previous day and the ineffectiveness of work meetings.  Anthony's girlfriend's purchase of coffee table books featuring nude men and women sparked a lengthy and explicit discussion about pornography, including their experiences with gay pornography, prompting numerous caller interactions filled with humorous and provocative comments.  They also played audio clips of police using tasers, leading to a debate about police conduct and a call from a former NYPD officer offering a police perspective.  A significant portion was devoted to criticizing *The View*, particularly Sherry Shepard's perceived lack of intelligence, with examples cited.  This segment was interspersed with discussions of various female celebrities and included further caller interactions and comedic commentary.  Dennis Leary's upcoming appearance was mentioned, along with a song from his band.  Adam Ferrara was also mentioned as a scheduled guest.

The show continued with discussions about relationships and infidelity, prompted by a female guest's new album.  Tyra Banks was mentioned as a guest known for hijacking conversations.  Numerous listener calls detailed marital issues, particularly weight gain and its impact on intimacy, with some callers advocating infidelity as a solution.  One caller described their spouse encouraging weight gain to prevent attractiveness to others, and another detailed their girlfriend's infidelity, including a deleted phone call with her ex-boyfriend.  A lengthy discussion about a "Guess the Sound" segment (a child playing Wii while being attacked by a dog) occurred.  *Rescue Me* and Dennis Leary (along with Adam Ferrara, who was a guest later) were discussed, including a conversation about Leary's transformation from an "obnoxious ass" to a sex symbol.  A caller described a pact with her husband allowing infidelity if either gained 50 pounds.  The segment concluded with promotion of a *Rescue Me* coffee table book.  Throughout this segment, there was considerable sexually suggestive commentary and crude humor.

Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara then appeared as guests, promoting their *Rescue Me* coffee table book.  They discussed Nicolas Cage's filmography and Jim Gandolfini's performance as Tony Soprano, with Leary arguing it was the greatest acting job in television history.  The conversation shifted to their book signing event, including details about time, location, and giveaways.  Leary shared an anecdote about his childhood rivalry with his brother and his Packers fandom.  This led to a discussion of the Patriots, Bill Belichick, Brett Favre, and Ricky Williams.  Leary's recent comedy shows, particularly his handling of Larry Craig material, were discussed, followed by tangents on men's bathroom etiquette, celebrity encounters (Randy Johnson), the Dallas Cowboys, and the Red Sox.  A heated exchange regarding radio personality Darren O'Toole and her interactions with Opie, particularly detailing their ongoing feud, concluded this segment, interspersed with crude humor and sexual innuendo.  The *Rescue Me* book and the guests' upcoming appearances were promoted.

A segment focused on E-Rock's relationship with a woman named Darian Atul, both with red hair.  The hosts and Jim Norton speculated about the nature of their relationship using explicit and vulgar terms, focusing on alleged communications and the possibility of a romantic or sexual involvement.  Fictional names (Bill Peters, Donnie O'Toole) used by E-Rock to disguise his texts were discussed.  E-Rock denied any serious involvement despite evidence presented.  The conversation delved into personal sexual preferences and experiences, including detailed descriptions of sexual acts and fetishes, with Jim Norton even demonstrating a nipple stimulation technique.  A caller inquired about Darian and E-Rock's relationship, followed by an open letter to Opie containing vulgar insults toward E-Rock.  A lie detector test for E-Rock was suggested.  Two adult film actresses, Caden Cross and Brie Olsen, were brought in.  The conversation shifted to their careers, experiences with other performers (like Lex Steele), and penis size preferences.  Adult films featuring the guests were shown and commented upon using explicit language.  Discussions about the adult film industry, specific performers, and graphic depictions of sexual acts continued until the segment concluded.

The final segment featured Brie Olsen and Caden Cross in studio.  It began with a discussion about a sea urchin, leading to a conversation about sexual acts, including anal sex.  They watched and reacted to "Two Girls, One Cup." The actresses discussed their experiences in the adult film industry, including rates, preferences for sexual acts (including double penetration), and past sexual experiences.  One actress revealed starting at age nine, and the other at age twelve with a twenty-year-old Jehovah's Witness.  The hosts received sex toys from Adam and Eve and attempted a demonstration, frequently interrupted by discussions about Sirius XM restrictions preventing penetration or explicit sexual acts on camera.  Despite the restrictions, the segment featured much discussion about sexual acts, preferences, and experiences, along with the guests' reactions to the industry's limitations.  The hosts expressed frustration with these restrictions. The segment concluded with the actresses promoting their work and websites, and the hosts summarizing their experience. A Dennis Leary song about rehab played, followed by a segment promoting the submission of wedding videos to the show.

[00:05:00]  books all the rage for gifts and uh oh jesus uh my my girlfriend went out and um got uh some coffee  table books not so much as gifts yeah uh until i saw them and said no you you got to give them away  as gifts because one of them is pretty cool it's um a photography book those are always good and  it's just of nude women which is cool like it's very artistic it's done very well and tastefully 
[00:05:30]  and but they kind of i've i've looked through those books and bookstores and and uh photoshops or  whatever you want to call them camera stores yeah and they always wreck it how's that i know it's tough  to wreck a uh like a a nude woman but they kind of do because they get too artsy with it they do get  too artsy but i mean they they don't want it to just be well you know a hustler i know but you  should bring the book in because i don't have a a good example right now yeah they they paint them 
[00:06:00]  up weird oh you're exactly right or they put weird masks on just stuff that just ruins it so you can't  really look at it and and think uh that it's really a hot picture right right you know it's uh it's  definitely not made um for a spanking right you know but anyway i interrupted so you got that which  was which was pretty cool but then there's another one it was um it was called romance and it was a  book of nude men in romantic poses with other men yes oh dear lord i was like what so she opens it up 
[00:06:30]  and uh i go i'm not even looking at this and i quickly scoot right up my next door i yeah i get  up there so i could get a good look no i said i go i'm not even gonna look at this so she goes oh no  look at this one it's so sweet and and it's a guy um like with his head on another guy's chest 
[00:07:00]  and he's doing something with his mouth like but he's laying on the guy's chest it's not anything  hardcore but it's like what like why i think that's nice a couple of men to a little head on the chest  there's nothing wrong with that it was so this and i told i go i'd rather watch a porno where it's just 
[00:07:30]  like nasty like that stuff then see guys in these romantic poses and then there's one where this guy  and he's like this this muscle guy and he's on a boardwalk to a beach and he doesn't have a stitch  of clothing on but he's holding an umbrella it's just like yeah it's raining out so you draw the line  with um romance the romance man stuff's okay but soon as it looks like there's a little feelings 
[00:08:00]  involved then you you're out that's when you tap out everyone is out everyone has gone on to uh  various uh websites uh porn sites or whatever and been subjected to uh watching uh man-on-man  hardcore just just horrid stuff animals whatever you want i mean just just hardcore sex  it's harder to look at guys making out a tender moment done in black and white photography your 
[00:08:30]  problem is the tenderness it's a horrid well especially if you know that one of the guys  is more attached than the other one you're like he's gonna get his feelings hurt look at the love in  his eyes i'd rather i'd rather something else get hurt than feelings of course you would if you're  talking about that because yeah we've had instances here where uh everyone's gone oh my god look at 
[00:09:00]  this and you gather around the computer and you just watch something horrific and it's funny it kind  of looks weird uh but that is just pure like it's cringe inducing in a man to watch that and and see that  type of tenderness romance and caressing yeah yeah caressing you don't want to hear caressing  that's cringe inducing when i see it between a man and a woman  so that was another of the uh books so i suggest that she give it as a gift yeah who gets it for 
[00:09:30]  chris well figure it out your mom no no figure it out it's uh well it's a little early hopefully  they won't listen to the replay it's uh somebody on staff someone else just say don wicklin well i  didn't think of that we might have to get two books you know the guy who threw us off by getting  married yeah does he get the coffee table oh boy you sure fooled everyone with that move didn't you don 
[00:10:00]  i saw don on page 96 of the book wait someone on staff yeah well on staff over at xm someone that  would enjoy a book full of nude men hey it could be could very well be one half of the great radio  team could very well be that's known as uh ron and fez yeah uh uh yeah well i mean everyone is  thinking it i mean wow i wow i blew the big reveal boy stupid me uh it could have been three or four 
[00:10:30]  guys over there shut up so fez he gets the coffee table yeah it looks that way how funny would it be  if ron was really the big fruit like the greatest joke of all time why don't you hand that book over  this way was that fez like chicks and that ron really enjoyed ron is just flaming but deep man  kissing ron likes ron doesn't even like it's not even the sex between many likes it's the kissing  and the sound like the eyes wide open just to connect to me that's horrible hey you got the

[00:32:00]  get back in the studio there was a german version that was a hit for like a day or two on the radio  so he did uh 99 red balloons in german for every chairman yeah this might get you very excited  anthony oh well it just sounds really good i don't know i don't know what the hell he's doing but it  sounds really good  it sounds hebrew yes it does it sounds like 
[00:32:30]  uh he's speaking it sounds like gerbil's being bar mitzvah  99  give it to me 
[00:33:00]  he's just a dope what a buffoon 
[00:33:30]  he went along with the song though  well kind of he was right there he uh he was right there with the song yeah well in in german  that's uh that's a that's a tough one but he did he was he was he was throwing in some yiddish  wow  all right uh hey speaking of tasing uh change the subject a little bit we got the brand new  tase audio for today yes almost every day there's one that uh is released cop tases driver only 45 
[00:34:00]  seconds after pulling him over is that true wow man that is maybe you could give him a little more  time will the guy get out of the car do we have video of this i don't know i don't i don't know  the video he better have a gun yeah does who we got this danny maybe danny could give us some uh  back uh background on this but here's uh here's how it went down it's really hard to hear but you  you could you could tell when the tasing yes at least 
[00:34:30]  so we'll talk about two phones he drives license 15 insurance  going 70 in a 65 mile an hour zone he's got a license for the 70 car and then license for the rear  of the car and she drives license for the insurance  whoa whoa whoa whoa no not whoa whoa whoa drive his license for the insurance or get out of the vehicle  step out of the vehicle 
[00:35:00]  step out of the vehicle and give me a driver's license for the insurance  step to the back of the vehicle  step to the back of the vehicle  come on ladies  oh wow women sure know how to uh they sure know how to scream when they get tased that is funny  every time man because it's not you it's funny because it's not you oh thank god 
[00:35:30]  sure makes everyone calm though as soon as it's done well the whole thing is calm the cop calms down  it's that moment of of the scream and but then everything's cool 
[00:36:00]  everything's cool everyone's cooperating hey i'm cooperating here what's up  i gotta go with the i gotta go with the cop on this one though really yeah i mean why are you arguing with the police officer just  he asked for the the proof insurance and your license what is the big deal about showing it just show it  why when did he actually tase her though because i mean uh she sounds like an idiot  but well what when she went violent or was she just being argumentative 
[00:36:30]  i think you can tase somebody just being argumentative  uh especially when she's a chick and you can just smash it with the nightstick  she just wasn't cooperating  i mean why can't you just just if you got pulled over by a police officer just cooperate with the officer  i think uh i think they might be getting a little taser happy  i don't know it just seems like maybe a little more dialogue uh to get them to comply  look man you know you're a cop you got a gun you want to you want to shoot that gun oh hell yeah 
[00:37:00]  but you pretty much can't under almost any circumstances uh these days but you get this  you got this taser oh you're gonna use it man yeah no one gets hurt in the end you're gonna use this  oh dude i'd be using that thing for like i'd be using on dates but she's like i don't he's yelling  at me this guy which is like who cares if he's yelling at you that's right was she on the phone  was that another one well no i don't think she was on the phone she i think the officer had pulled  her over for uh i think she was barely speeding yeah it was probably you know what was the what was 
[00:37:30]  the charge again this cop sounds like a dick well he said that she was doing like 65 it was like a it  was like five miles over the speed limit she went down oh boy did she just drop like a  sack of potatoes she was only five miles over the uh the speed limit yeah and she had most cops  will give you that man she admits to it but most of the boys will give you that they'll give you  five or six miles no problem i think he wanted to tase somebody that day yeah he definitely just  wanted to tase them let me hear the beginning of that too because i i i kind of want to hear the 
[00:38:00]  dialogue going on okay tasing it doesn't sound there's any threat to him at all yeah that's what i'm  trying to by the way once again you're starting to know the show i hope uh all this stuff we talk  about that is visual we we give you a link later on in the day at onaradio.com so you'll see this  video later on today okay uh but here it is again the audio portion  that's what's going to do is get out of the vehicle 
[00:38:30]  no this guy doesn't hear you  I don't know. 
[00:39:00]  I don't know, but...  There was no license on the front or the rear of the car, too?  There was a plate on the front, but not the rear.  Oh, that's odd.  Hey, you know, we support the cops.  You know that.  Looking at the video, I really don't know why she got tased.  I need more info on this one,  because the video doesn't really show where she was, you know, being that bad. 
[00:39:30]  He did what I would want to do.  Oh, yeah.  Just shut up.  Just shut up.  Shut up.  She got out of the vehicle.  Now, apparently, she was talking to somebody.  Was this a passenger?  Yeah, I think there's a passenger in the car,  although you can't.  It's kind of the video is kind of hard to tell.  Yeah, because she said, like, you know, this guy would, you know.  And then she stepped out of the vehicle.  And what was she not complying with once she stepped out of the vehicle?  Well, he's asking her to step to the rear of the vehicle.  It looked like she was walking toward the rear of the vehicle. 
[00:40:00]  She kind of turns to, like, further engage this guy in an argument.  And he's just shut up, put your hands on the vehicle, and when she didn't.  I have to jump in.  A lot of people saying it's a dude, not a chick.  What?  Oh, is that a dude?  It's hard to tell.  I thought it was a guy.  It sounds like a chick.  It sounds like a dude when he's saying, it sounds like a dude when the guy is saying,  I don't know what he's yelling at me for.  That, to me, sounded a little bit like a man.  A lot of people saying it's a guy.  The description that Break's given, break.com, it's a dude.  Oh, well, then he should be tased just for talking like that. 
[00:40:30]  That was a very femme-y way to talk.  It doesn't sound like a dude.  No.  It can go either way.  The face is blurred out, so it's kind of difficult.  No worries.  Maybe that's why he tased it.  How do we get these police videos on Break?  Like, how do the cops release it to Break.com?  Somebody's...  They have an exclusive.  They have to?  I don't know.  Hey, we've got to form a cop on the line.  This is amazing.  He's going to stick up for the cop here, and he should.  Dennis in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Great. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, I'm a former cop in New York, and I just want to talk a little bit about this, the  tasing thing.  Okay.  You know, I haven't seen the video, but just listening to it, you know, the cop goes up.  She has no license plate on the rear of the car.  Is there another person in the vehicle, it sounds like?  I think a woman.  It looks like there's another person in the vehicle, sure.  Okay.  So he's asking, he already asked her four times, at least, to exit the vehicle, take  your seatbelt off, and then it looks like he made, like, a motion to go and, like, you  know, take her out of the vehicle.  And when she resisted, his life could have been in danger. 
[00:41:30]  He doesn't know if she has a gun, if the person in the car has a gun.  Not having license plates on the car is a lot of times what drug runners do.  And, I mean, just because she sounds like an older white woman doesn't mean she doesn't  fit that mold.  So he's protecting himself.  He has another person in the car that he can't control.  So he's got to get her out.  And when she says no, he's got to do what he's got to do to protect himself.  There you go.  The cops are right again.  See?  All right.  Totally justified.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Should have tased the passenger, too.  We have to take a quick break here. 
[00:42:00]  Our old pal Dennis Leary is stopping by.  He hasn't been around in a while.  He's a big, huge TV star now.  Of course he is.  He's coming in to say hi.  And Adam Ferrara will be here as well, I think, within the next half hour.  Yep.  And Dennis Leary, you know, he performs with his band that he's been with since the college  days.  Mm-hmm.  And they released a new song called At The Rehab.  And when I saw Dennis Leary and Friends, I don't know, a couple weeks ago, this was a  big hit for everybody.  Everyone enjoyed this in the audience.  So check it out as we go to break.  Dennis Leary, At The Rehab. 
[00:42:30]  You must be rich and famous, or somewhere on the end is for The Rehab.  Yeah, everybody's knowin' Ozzy Osbourne since he's away to The Rehab. 
[00:43:00]  They got a hot tub and a sauna if you are a star.  And if you dip the staff, you get a mini bar.  If you're homophobic and you're hatin' the gays, checkin' to where Isaiah Washington stays.  At The Rehab.  At The Rehab.  If you are an alcoholic, pretend to take care of it.  At The Rehab. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe you're a junkie, we can help you hide your monkey.  At The Rehab.  If your career is in the toilet, it will be okay.  Disappear in treatment for just thirty days.  Eat and sleep and come out later looking clean.  Get on all the covers of the magazines.  At The Rehab.  At The Rehab.  Robert Downey Jr. said to Nick Nolteh. 
[00:44:00]  Promises in Malibu's to play to stay, ma.  Kevin said that Britney baby sits in the buff.  So when you go to Rehab, you can see her muff.  Whitney Houston, crack.  Bobby Brown, boo.  Courtney Love, crack.  Kate Moss, hope.  Pete Doherty, everything.  Mel Gibson, true hate.  Billy Joel, he sucks.  Amy Winehouse, ironic. 
[00:44:30]  She used a big book for a photo op  to try and push the numbers on her latest flop.  It's going to get worse before it gets any better.  Here's to Betty Ford.  She was a real transcenta.  At The Rehab. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, At The Rehab.  They got big fluffy towels.  At The Rehab.  You can see Tom's eyes were at The Rehab.  They got a five-star menu at The Rehab.  Say hello to Danny Baldwin at The Rehab.  Yeah.  Oh, it's all happening at The Rehab.  Let's all get some sushi at The Rehab.  I don't know. 
[00:45:30]  I know we're like a guy show.  We got some chicks listening.  We got some broads listening.  We got some skirts listening.  We know that.  But for the most part, we, I don't know, we're broadcasting for men.  So maybe bringing up The View is kind of stupid on our part,  but I can't get enough of the stupid view. 
[00:46:00]  You really should DVR The View.  Every day, it's amazing to watch these women speak.  These hens.  My chick, she gets pissed off how stupid they are.  And I think a lot of women out there get pissed off at how stupid they are.  It's an amazing show.  Worth watching for the comedy value.  It's for chicks.  Just cackling egg layers.  That's what they sound like.  Cackling egg.  They should all be sitting on a white thing in a nest. 
[00:46:30]  Just fools.  You know, people describe our show, the appeal of the Ovi and Anthony show,  you get to hear guys being guys, right?  And I think that's the appeal of The View.  You get to see broads being broads when the guys aren't around.  Broads.  And if this is any indication, wow.  Wow.  You ever go to a party or a get-together,  and the people kind of split up.  The girls end up somewhere in the kitchen or somewhere, 
[00:47:00]  and then the guys end up in the living room, and they're both talking.  And then you kind of get an ear over there into what the girls are talking about,  and you're just like, they're talking about baking and baskets.  It's usually shoes or something that you just, I couldn't go over there.  Just banal nonsense.  Decorative baskets.  Yeah.  So I think it looks pretty good.  It was a little blondier than I like it.  But he highlighted, shut up! 
[00:47:30]  There's a war going on.  You never lean in and hear that.  You never lean in and hear that.  Well, I can't believe there was that many troops killed.  It's just always some banal drivel.  It's just dreck.  By the way, I love the word banal.  It should be used way more on this show.  Just nonsense.  Banal's a great word.  I told her that the lashes were a little long,  so she goes, she want me to make them shorter.  I don't know.  Get it.  I don't know.  We cut off a half an inch. 
[00:48:00]  I really wanted an inch.  What do you think?  Never political.  It's never, it's never, I don't know,  Obama did say that once in a debate,  and then he backtracked,  and I don't know why Hillary's not calling him.  It's never that.  No, no.  I got a new nail girl,  and she's not as good as my last one.  Oh, it's just.  What do you think of the color?  You think he went too light?  That's it.  Look, and I broke this one.  I'm hoping it looks natural.  What do you think?  You know what?  And you can shut them all up  by just dangling a shiny thing in front of them. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Just hang a watch and watch them all up.  Well, I think that's why I watch The View every day.  It's the type of stuff that's on  after we're done with our morning show, by the way.  It's all chick programming, so you can't help it.  It's around you.  I take a peek at Tyre every day,  and she's still, you know,  we never really harness the potential  that Tyre brings.  We really haven't.  I mean, she still makes it about herself no matter what. 
[00:49:00]  No matter what the subject is.  No matter what.  She has been through worse.  She had Mandy Moore on the other day.  Yeah.  I know this is chick stuff.  I get it, but Mandy Moore's, you know,  Tyre goes,  have you ever had a bad breakup?  And Mandy Moore is ready to spill her guts  about her bad breakup  that still affects her to this day.  And Mandy Moore maybe started talking about it  for 15 seconds,  and then Tyre's like,  yeah, let me tell you about my bad breakup.  She asked a question just so she could talk  about her bad breakup,  and Mandy Moore's face was priceless. 
[00:49:30]  Have you ever been a black supermodel  in a white world?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me tell you about my experience in it.  What?  You know, we never minded the gold that Tyre has.  We just haven't.  I mean, we'll continue to try,  but she is god-awful.  So anyway, The View,  they have this new broad, Sherry Shepard.  She's as dumb as they come.  She brings nothing  but potential heart failure to the table. 
[00:50:00]  Who did she replace, by the way?  I don't know.  Star Jones, you know.  Quirky?  She's stupid.  It's an old reference,  but how many of the famous retards are there?  True.  Uh-oh, liberals pipe up,  George Bush!  So, let's remember,  this is what Sherry Shepard said  a month or two ago,  maybe three months ago at this point.  Uh, about the,  she doesn't know if the world is flat.  Yeah.  Honestly.  Women, this is who's representing you on TV. 
[00:50:30]  This, uh, this thing.  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I never thought about it, Whoopi.  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about whether the world was right?  No, because I,  but I'll tell you what I've thought about,  how I'm going to feed my child,  how I'm going to take care of my family.  The world is the world flat has never entered into,  that has not been an important thing to me.  You'll teach your son, Jeffrey, right?  If my son, Jeffrey,  asked me if the world flat,  I guess I will go.  You know, 
[00:51:00]  didn't come over?  My husband's already worked this question out.  I mean,  why are we doing it?  Wow.  It's funny.  Yeah.  Didn't we already work this question out?  Yeah.  That's a good answer.  It's amazing.  All you have to do is look at one stupid photo  they're taking from the space shuttle every once in a while.  I mean,  she was serious.  Well,  it does look flat from the shuttle.  Just looks flat like a disc just sitting there.  It looks like a ball just kind of floating.  Who are you kidding?  It's like at a party when the girls break up  and you poke your head in.  What you hear?  It's unabashed idiocy. 
[00:51:30]  Unabashed idiocy.  It really is.  It's pointless verbal pecking  and it's just dumb meandering.  It really is.  It's a bunch of fashion tips  and just pointless meandering.  And banal in nature.  The banality of their dribble is mind bending.  Look,  see,  there's a picture of Earth.  It looks flat right there.  Shut up.  What a dolt. 
[00:52:00]  Shut up.  They just are piping up about eggnog recipes.  Yeah.  A bunch of guys are in there talking about  at least important things like tax.  When's the last time you heard a bunch of broads  talking about tax codes?  And where your tax money's going.  Exactly.  No.  Important worldly things.  How much do you tip if they put the frosted highlights  and I'll throw them $22?  Will ya?  I spent three hours at the parlor. 
[00:52:30]  What do you think?  Yuck.  Did you go to Perez Hilton today?  Oh.  Anyway.  Did you read an Us magazine?  Hmm?  About, um...  Us.  It's more like cosmopolitan.  They read cosmopolitan.  No, no, no.  But they read like...  They like the celebrity stuff, too.  Of course they do.  You know?  Johnny Depp. 
[00:53:00]  Who's dating who?  Mm-hmm.  Who made a fashion faux pas?  On the red carpet.  Did you see what she was wearing?  All right.  Well, if Barbara Walters wasn't so senile,  well, she would have fired this thing  for saying that she doesn't know if the world is flat.  Yeah.  But anyway, we played that clip today  because she did it again yesterday.  Yeah.  The Sherry Shepard.  Not a smart gal.  She stated yesterday on The View, 
[00:53:30]  and I'm telling you, man,  this is not a rare thing.  Every day, it's great TV watching.  She said yesterday that nothing predated Jesus.  Nothing.  Nothing predated Jesus.  Good.  Like, wait a minute.  So there was just this vacuum.  Joy Behar was talking about like Greek philosophers,  I believe.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know which one in particular,  but some Greek philosopher.  Right.  And then they got into a discussion 
[00:54:00]  about Greek gods and Jesus,  and this is what this dummy said.  You got to get past the yip, yip, yip,  and the ah, ah, ah,  the clucking that goes on in the beginning.  It's so hard to hear anybody talking through that mess.  But here we go.  This is a, oh, what is it?  The verbal jousting began when Joy Behar  mentioned watching a History Channel show  on the Greek philosopher,  Oh, boy. 
[00:54:30]  Epicurus?  No.  Huh?  The E's actually silent.  It's probably like Epicurus.  Epicurus, probably.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, they do that.  Yeah, sure.  Epicurus sounds like a nail bot.  Yeah, you could cure that.  And his definition of happiness.  Keep in mind that probably when Epicurus was around,  there was no Jesus Christ stuff going on,  said co-host Whoopi Goldberg.  And then that's when Sherry Shepard had to jump in.  Here we go.  Here's from The View yesterday.  Keep in mind that probably when he was around, 
[00:55:00]  there was no Jesus Christ stuff going on.  No, no, they still had Christians back then.  No, no, no.  They still had Christians back then.  I don't want to think they had their...  I mean, they had their gods.  The Greeks believed.  They had Christians and they had...  They had Christians and they came in the back.  I think you just might predate that.  I think this might predate that.  Who came first?  Then the Romans, then the Christians.  Jesus came first, before they saw them. 
[00:55:30]  I don't want to start the story.  It doesn't matter, anyway.  They don't believe in Jesus.  They believe in Polytheism.  Thank God for Joy Behar.  What was it, polytheism?  Well, we're going to play the clip now without all the sound effects.  But we were just trying to have fun with that.  What sound effects?  You're not going to add anything or take anything away from it by playing it regular.  It's the same.  You can't hear any of it. 
[00:56:00]  It was funny, but a bit distracting.  So now here's the clip without us being dicks.  This is what you should listen for in the beginning when she says something about they didn't have any Jesus stuff back then.  And then Dummy, Dummy pipes up with, oh, they had Christians back then, meaning the time of the Greek philosophers, which was, what was it, 5,000 years ago?  Yeah.  Even though it's 2007.  Probably when he was around, there was no Jesus Christ stuff going on.  No, no, they still had Christians back then.  I don't want to think they're, I mean, they had their gods. 
[00:56:30]  The Greeks believed them.  They had Christians and they had, I'm doing the outshot thing now.  In the Greeks, they had Christians and they threw them instead of lions.  I think this might predate that.  I think this might predate that.  You don't think anything predated Christians.  No, no, no.  It's all the right.  The Greeks came first.  Yes, the Greeks were first.  Then the Romans, then the Christians.  Jesus came first before them.  So I, I, I, okay, all right, all right.  Not on paper.  Okay.  Not on paper.  Okay.  Yeah, I don't want to turn this to a reason.  It doesn't matter anyway. 
[00:57:00]  They didn't believe in Jesus.  They believed in polytheism, many gods.  You can't be this stupid.  In the year 2007.  Yes, because that means.  Year of our Lord.  He was born 2007 years ago.  Right.  See, that's what our calendar is based on.  Based on the birth of Jesus.  There's a whole thing called BC.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now this, which is something I actually have been told that I have.  Now this, uh, this sissy, uh, philosopher was born.  This sissy.  41.  Philosophers are sissy. 
[00:57:30]  Let me jump in.  That, uh, looks a lot like Rich Voss.  Uh, the haircut anyway.  It's got the Rich Voss do.  The big head.  This Greek philosopher.  Um, 300, 341 BC.  So it's, it's not that long before Christ.  But it was before.  Philosophers are all terribly boring people.  Of course.  They just, they're like, they just sit around and say things and someone goes, well, that sounds  pretty bright and I'll, I'll live by it.  And it was because, and it was only because it was so long ago that not many people had  spoken anything that even sounded remotely bright.  So you just say one thing that's kind of bright and you're like, whoa, this guy, we got to write 
[00:58:00]  this down and save it for the ages.  Whoa, we got a brainiac.  Look at this guy.  You just had to say it with confidence and sound smart and the other dummies who are all  short.  Have semi-nude young boys around you while you're saying it.  Just, yes, nymphs and satyrs.  Boy, did they love it.  So there you go.  If a man falls, he must rise.  Well, I'll live by that. 
[00:58:30]  Check out the big brain on Play-Doh.  Hate philosophy.  If nothing was around until Jesus, wouldn't that have made him the oldest man on earth  this whole life?  Cool.  That's Gut Shot Drew from Howl.  Let's say hi to Caesar in New York.  Caesar.  Look, Connor, this is why no country will ever have a woman president because some other  country will come over with a mirror, a lighter and some sparkly stuff and they'll be conquered. 
[00:59:00]  They're a retard.  Well, there have been women, not exactly presidents, I don't know, but leaders.  There have been a bunch of women leaders.  Maggie Thatcher ran England for quite some time.  Absolutely.  And she did a good job.  And the Queen Mum.  Ronnie.  The Queen Mum.  The Queen Mum's a douche.  Runs a few things.  What, we don't know.  The Queen Mum is just awful.  Enough with that whole ancient way of doing things and thinking irrelevant. 
[00:59:30]  Well, you're not.  Let's go to Christy in Boston listening on BCN.  Christy.  What's up?  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  What's up?  There's tons of girls that listen to your show.  I don't know what you guys are talking about, but...  Oh, take the joke, will you?  Come on.  But no, the view, embarrassing to the gender.  Embarrassing to the gender.  That's disgusting.  They hate that shit.  Dope stuff.  No, don't.  Dope.  What are you trying to say, Christy? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  What am I trying to say?  Yeah.  That women are intelligent.  We don't sit there at well.  Ah, that's what she's getting at.  No women are intelligent.  I kind of defended that in the beginning of this break, so...  Yeah, some of you are fine.  I don't think the view is intelligent watching, I think.  No.  And especially that dolt.  Joy is by far the smartest one.  Joy is really...  By far the smartest one.  Joy's really good, but the little interaction I've had with her, you know, out and about,  she is holding way back.  She is filthy. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Well, she's got a dirty, dirty mind.  On that show, she absolutely has to.  I think she's a real calm.  She's a real standard.  I think she's biting her tongue all the time, man.  Yeah.  She's got to get a huge paycheck.  She's very, very famous.  She can't just go out and drop the C-bomb on Barbara.  She should.  Of course she should.  And they all...  She should call her one.  They all suck up to Barbara every day when she's on the view.  It's disgusting.  Barbara, it's her show.  It is disgusting.  It's disgusting, though.  Barbara Walters should just shut her face and step down.  I love the fact that Pryor banged her. 
[01:01:00]  Paul Mooney said that.  Really?  And I asked him when I sat next to him.  Wow.  Oh, I tell you that.  Yeah, I sat next to him on The Roast.  And he was actually very...  We had a good time just talking and making fun of other people.  Did he do the Paul Mooney?  That's real.  That's real.  I can't really do him.  I love that.  No, you're doing a really good one.  He's doing great.  Only a few people out there appreciate it, but it's a great impression.  You know, I'm butter.  That bitch is dirty.  Let's do it.  But Mooney is...  He's a really funny guy, man. 
[01:01:30]  And I was sitting next to him.  It was Lisa Lampanelli, Paul Mooney, and myself were on the little small couch of the Gene  Simmons roast.  And so we were talking, and I had heard that Paul claimed that Richard Pryor had sex with  Dolly Parton.  So I'm like, did Richard really bang?  And he loves talking about Richard, so he'll tell you all the inside stuff.  And he goes, yeah.  And I'm like, how about Barbara Walters?  I heard that you've said that before.  And he goes, oh, yeah.  Yeah, he banged her.  And then he was talking about how when Farrakhan interviewed her, he's like, you can see the  way she reacts to black guys.  She likes black.  Really?  Yeah.  He said that watch their dynamics.  We watched a prior interview with her and re-watched it. 
[01:02:00]  Can I ask you something?  Sure.  Would you ever bang Barbara Walters?  Many, many years ago, maybe.  I don't know what she was like.  There's a nude picture of her on the internet.  There is?  Yeah.  She doesn't look that good.  What would be the circumstances where you would actually bang her?  She'll have to do a story on me.  There you go.  You could pick any Barbara Walters, too.  Obviously, you could go for the young one if you want.  The 70s one?  She's never been attractive.  But prior, he was such a charismatic guy. 
[01:02:30]  I could see where a white girl would fall for him.  And I just think it's so great that he probably did it not because she was beautiful, but because  she was Barbara Walters.  Yeah.  And he was just going to give this snooty, uppity white lady a taste.  Let's say hi.  They're hooked.  Let's say hi to Eric in Queens before we lose him.  He's got a good observation here.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Let me tell you, I was doing the math in my head, and that means that, according to what  she just said, Jesus was hatched because he had no parents, because there's obviously 
[01:03:00]  nothing before Jesus.  There were no human beings before Jesus.  Wow.  This changes everything.  You're saying that Jesus came from an egg.  Hmm.  Well, obviously, because obviously...  I mean, you know, the egg that we all think, like a chicken egg.  What about Adam and Eve?  Didn't she, like, get into that whole thing?  And Noah?  Like, she's even got her stupid religion stuff all mixed up.  What about Noah?  Yeah, what about all the Old Testament stuff?  Hey, I'm not defending it.  If she wants to make a stupid comment like that, she can go right ahead. 
[01:03:30]  Personally, if she wants to believe that Jesus came from, I don't know, a spaceship, she  goes right ahead.  You know something, one of our own, Black Earl, who works on the Ron and Fez show, oh,  excuse me, who's affiliated with the Ron and Fez show.  I almost used the word for it.  Well, he fills a quota for the Ron and Fez show.  He has some, and if I may use the word cockamamie ideas about religion and earth history. 
[01:04:00]  Does he believe the earth?  Because I remember Carl Everett of the Mets believed this, I think, or Red Sox.  Or 6,000 years old only?  Yes, he's one of these people that think the earth is like 6,000 years old.  Carbon dating is wrong.  That carbon dating is wrong.  That Noah, when he put the animals on the ark, had baby dinosaurs on the ark.  Little baby dinosaurs.  How adorable would that be?  That would be awesome.  You rub a little stegosaurus belly and go, Jack, Jack. 
[01:04:30]  I would call him Jack, Jack just because my cat's name is Jack, Jack.  Oh my God, please don't.  You must have went out and bought Jack, Jack.  Oh God.  No, actually, Steve from Bayshore gave him.  Why?  A little known fact.  I didn't know that.  Linger longer.  You didn't say it.  Linger longer.  You didn't say it right there.  Linger longer.  I'll do it.  Linger longer.  Hey, listen.  Coming out.  Hey, getting ready for Dennis Leary.  We were talking about Tyra and the Mandy Moore thing, and Sam, right on top of it, he ran and  grabbed the audio for us. 
[01:05:00]  Of course he is.  He has an iPod.  The bag.  So this is Tyra making it about herself again.  This is all she does with her team.  Great show.  Oh, what a good guy you are.  Tyra asks about heartache, then starts to hijack the conversation.  Listen to this.  There's a lot of, like, heartache to me, especially on the song, Garginia.  Yeah.  Were you heartbroken?  Oh, yeah.  Is that why you are talking about it so much in this album?  I mean, I think as a young woman, it's a pretty prevalent theme in all times.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Realizing it's okay to feel confused about what you want in life and what you don't want in  life.  And heartbreak definitely factors in, and it has for me.  But when you think about your heartbreaks, because I think about my heartbreaks, and  I have probably two that stand out the most for me.  And there she goes.  And I have two.  Not one.  It's not even a quick story.  Let me tell you a quickie and then get back to your story.  I got two that stand out for me.  Why don't you just go backstage?  Why don't you leave?  Right.  Just leave.  Your limos outside. 
[01:06:00]  I'll finish the show.  I'll finish my show.  Yeah.  I just needed you to set me up.  You've got to see the video because Manny Moore's eyes get real big.  And then I just got the hiccups.  She's very hateable.  Cool.  Sarah Banks.  Yeah.  Hatable.  Hatable.  She's hateable.  Yeah.  And then Manny tries to take it back.  Nice.  Good.  Good for her.  Because Tyra said heartaches.  You know, your whole album's about maybe someone doing you wrong.  Heartaches in your life.  Have you had any?  And Manny said yes.  But then Tyra makes it about herself.  Hijack the story.  And then Manny tries to take it back. 
[01:06:30]  You know something?  You think the publicists and other people that are affiliated with some of the guests now actually  say, look, Tyra's going to try to just make it all about  her.  You've got to get in there and fight to be able to get your story out or plug your album  or whatever it is.  I still believe that the Tyra thing can work on the Opie and Anthony show.  You've got to find more moments where she just hijacks the conversation.  That'll be your gig for a little while, Sam.  So Manny tries to take it back.  Me too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two that really stand out the most.  And it was.  Did you leave them or did they leave you? 
[01:07:00]  My first one, I left him, but it was still very painful for me because we broke up 12  times.  Yeah.  And then finally one day I woke up and I was like, okay, it's over.  The second one like dropped my ass really, really.  I mean, it was awful.  He dropped me and I was like begging him back.  Like it was really, really sad.  But this is not about me.  It's about Mandy.  No, no, no.  Well, she actually says it's not about me.  It's about Mandy after making it completely about her. 
[01:07:30]  And then Mandy has to go.  No, no, no, no.  Yes.  And we don't want to bore people with Tyra close.  But then Tyra continues.  She's no way.  Yeah.  And talks about after she says this isn't about me.  It's about Mandy.  She is incapable.  Yes.  She looks like Francine in that picture.  Does she?  Yeah.  She looks like nutty Francine.  I hate Tyra.  She's a hateable person.  She's beautiful and all that.  But man, she is not.  She's disgusting.  She's beautiful yet disgusting.  Because there's beauty that comes from a woman when they're talking and conversing and all. 
[01:08:00]  When?  I knew Jimmy.  Hold on a minute.  I'm not going to allow that one.  When?  Unless they're saying it's big.  Beautiful.  When is there beauty when they're conversing?  I don't know.  I've never seen it.  I love my girlfriend, but the less she yaps, the happier we are.  That's wonderful, Jimmy.  If it works for you, God bless you.  I love her.  God, just quit yapping.  God bless you.  Just listen to this Sabbath I'm playing.  Keep it down over there. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  We got to take a break.  Dennis Leary a few minutes away here.  Where is Dennis Leary?  We also have to play.  I don't know.  He's probably on.  Is he here?  That was just a little radio tease.  I don't know.  Also, we got a Billy Joel song that we want to play for everybody today.  That somebody else is singing.  It's an anti-war song.  It's rare for an artist.  Yeah.  And also after the break, I swear, too.  After the break, we'll finally tell you what this sound is.  Guess the sound.  Oh, right.  We really will.  A lot of people are trying to figure this out. 
[01:09:00]  Here it is.  Guess this sound today.  After the break, we'll tell you what that is.  Yes, Jimmy?  I have a guess.  Okay.  That's what goes on inside a woman's head when you say, I'd like you to discuss something 
[01:09:30]  other than hair and makeup.  Let's not forget, the word of the day is banal.  Yes.  Just the banality of your childlike thoughts make me ill.  I'm kidding, of course.  I'm coming off as really anti-woman, but I'm not.  I'm very pro-broad.  Topian Anthony.  Dennis Leary on the way 
[01:10:00]  Tommy Gavin  in the house today  Rescue Me  what's going on with Rescue Me with the Rider Strike  I guess we'll find out  love the Rescue Me  finally caught up  got all the box sets and  I'm up to date man  phone number 877-212  O&A Adam Farrar also coming in  he'll be in in a few minutes  actually  at the rehab  that chorus is running through my head 
[01:10:30]  one of those things you hear all day  it's stuck in your head  it's badgering me  I'm trying to  I keep hearing at the rehab  hey let's do guess the sound  yeah please  let's stop being radio teases  and give the people the answer  do this get this done  it's an old radio trick  oh there's a bunch of people who go  I'm not going to play their game  and they just go about their business  but there's a lot of people right now  they're not turning off the show  until they find out what that dumb sound is  I'm not  oh wait  if we were really smart  we would drag this out for another hour 
[01:11:00]  but you know  we'd try to be nice as well  we'd drag it out for an entire day  here's the sound  and let's go right to the phone for the answer 
[01:11:30]  John in Jersey has it  John what is  guess the sound today  I think it sounds like  Richard Piner having sex with Barbara Wolfe  there you go  watch him talk  you can see the dynamic  very good bro  very good  let's say hi to Angelo in Jersey  Angelo  oh hey how are you  long time  how are you doing buddy  hey buddy  yeah  I always thought  a lady in a shower perhaps 
[01:12:00]  a hot water gets shut off on her  oh it gets shut off  or gets too hot  or gets too cold  that's a good guess  that scream sounds like it's cold  yeah but she would be  standing in there for a little long  yeah  wouldn't you jump out  instead of just standing there  screaming  right  like that  ah  ah  ah  turn the water off  dummy  they don't know any better  they just jump up and down  you know you feel  extreme hot water  for maybe  a millisecond  oh yeah  and it's still just awful 
[01:12:30]  no one  no one stays in there  you know what you do  and  and what you do  is you like  you jump up  like you're  you're in a tip off  for a basketball game  and smack the head of the shower  yeah  so it just like  goes off to the wall somewhere  oh yeah  but you do  you only feel it for a split second  but you know  this is really hot  and painful  you rush  if it's really hot  you rush  towards it  to you under the spigot  like under the shower  oh you do that  just tower  and then it's over you  and then you just like  reach down like right next to your fat stomach 
[01:13:00]  or mine  turn the valve  you know when  when the water gets too hot  you find out that your body  can do amazing things  amazing things  yeah  it's amazing how fast  you can turn your girlfriend's back  to the water  you do like matrix moves  yeah you're bending over  you go into matrix mode  when that happens  let's say hi to Cody in Indiana  Cody what's up  what's up  hey man  I think that the sound actually  is the inside of Jeff Ross's head 
[01:13:30]  when Ken Burns was on the show  hey that's a good guess  this guy lingers a bit longer  oh I don't know  thank you sir  let's go to Eric in Jersey  Eric  hey what's up guys  hey  alright  I uh  I'm pretty sure I saw this video  the other day  it's the video of the crazy German  kid playing Counter-Strike  and screaming at the computer  ooh  ooh  kid playing Counter-Strike  ooh  getting a little warmer  yeah  a little warmer  let's say hi to Greg on Long Island  Greg what's up  wow I really didn't think 
[01:14:00]  I'd get on the air with this one  Anthony's ex-wife  when the  the last check  runs out  well  is this a look into the future  is that what you're saying sir  hopefully coming soon  it's the future  the future  very good Greg  and in the meantime  it's me  every time I have to write one  yeah  well the sound is simple  it's um  it's a  a kid  playing with his Wii  oh  it's Than 
[01:14:30]  huh  it's Than  it's not  Than has a Wii  and he gets very childlike  when he plays it  um  well the kid's playing with his Wii  and um  his dog is in the room  yeah  and the dog  uh  attacks the kid  so to speak  no way  as in  you know  you've been to someone's house  and they're  the dog was getting frisky  with the  oh  way frisky  as the kid was trying to  play the Wii  yes  and now the kid has a dilemma 
[01:15:00]  because it sounds like  he's having a really good game  with the Wii  so he doesn't want to ruin his game  he doesn't want to ruin his  real good game that's going on  but you certainly don't want a dog  uh  doing that  no  wow  what a  what a dilemma  so  and it comes out like this  oh  give me one  give me one  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah 
[01:15:30]  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  okay  now it's hysterical  yeah  absolutely  I had no idea what that was  it comes together  if you listen long  I haven't seen the video  the video's pretty funny  it's up on break.com  I believe it's on the front page  D-Rock's popping it up  and then we'll  like we said earlier  yeah  link it  yeah  yeah we'll link it to  onaradio.com 
[01:16:00]  later on  oh no  the video is really good  oh the dog is just  tackling this kid  you know what  the  he has to pretty much  stop playing the game  it's not even about  messing up his good game  at this point  he's fighting for his life  yeah  the kid is fighting for his life  and  and who's like  filming this  his genetic code  is about to be changed  right  why wouldn't  the person  he was pwned by his dog  yeah who trained the dog  why wouldn't the person  filming this  drop the camera  and help out the little fella 
[01:16:30]  cause it's hysterical  it really  it seems like  a parent or somebody  is filming it  because it looks like  it's coming from above  so it's somebody  who's a lot taller  than this little kid  yeah  and they're laughing  in the background  so I think the parent  just saw the  dog attacking the kid  and just started laughing  at him and grabbed the camera  that is great  hey we all know  the Steve sound  ah  that is real  I'm  that's hilarious  that is really funny  the dog is  very into it 
[01:17:00]  the dog is bigger  than the kid  and the kid's  just screaming  oh yeah  is he screaming more  because of what the dog's doing  or that it's ruining  his Wii game  I think it's a little  of both  yeah  I think he's so bummed  that he's like  oh my god  I'm never gonna get  to this point  of the game again  Stan would you be upset  more at the game  or what the dog is doing  I know you're a big  Wii fan  oh I'm good  with the paws  I could  oh okay  you can paws  and throw the dog  off of you  just put some oven mitts  on him  it just goes 
[01:17:30]  to show you though  what dogs think  of Wii players  the kid wants  to get the dog  to paws  yeah Wii players  are all bottoms  of course  do you think  it's embarrassing  for the dog  in those videos  when they have  to tape  the oven mitts  on it  even though  he's getting  to have sex  with a human  do you think  he feels stupid  with those mitts  and silver duct tape  the thought  that you know  that they use  oven mitts  is really disturbing  I never would have 
[01:18:00]  thought that  they do  oven mitts  it's like they do  don't for a second  think I doubt it  no one's doubting it  I know they must  but you know that  just because  it's a dog's instinct  to sink his claws  into somebody  they have to have mitts  they get that  the dew claw  it's called  that one that's  on the side  that could just  scratch right into you  plus it's perfect  because after he has  sex with you  he can go grab  the casserole  burning his little paws  bring me  bring me that  hot quiche  I didn't realize 
[01:18:30]  no you didn't  Steve  so the remixes  continue to come in  we played this once  and it's worth  playing again  that's Steve  making his dumb noises  before he does  production for the show  and Brad the rooster  in Michigan  took that sound  and put it to music  and people are  starting to say  this is the best one  that came in  a lot of good ones  came in  but here's living  on a bear  once again  you live for the fight  when that's all  that you've got 
[01:19:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  you've got to remember 
[01:19:30]  Steve did not make these sounds  so they would fit into songs  no  it's very talented people  yeah  let's say hi to Brian in Oregon  a second call from Oregon today  what is going on  we're hot in Oregon  Bigfoot country  yes  Pacific Northwest  Have you seen a Sasquatch?  A Sasquatch?  Yeah, she's sitting on my couch.  Oh, wow, that ain't good.  Uh-oh.  Guys, I'm getting so fed up with these girly shows, soap operas, crap. 
[01:20:00]  My wife was 110 pounds when I married her.  She's 165 pounds.  She's a hog.  Well, it says on the phone here,  her wife became fat pig from watching all these shows like The View and Tyra and Oprah and all of them, right?  Yeah, she DVRs them, and then at night when she's done with the kids all day and stuff,  she sits and eats a pound of chocolate, a bag of Twizzlers, drinks about a half a liter of Pepsi, 
[01:20:30]  and throws out on these shows for like four or five hours before finally passing out,  you know, drooling candy all over herself.  How annoyed do you get when you see her eating chocolate and a Pepsi?  I mean, it's like worn out, man.  I'm just sitting here trying to get some sleep.  I got to be up at 2 o'clock in the morning most of the time, 4 o'clock in the morning,  and she's sitting over there crunch, crunch, crunch, you know, slurp, slurp, slurp.  You know, sir, she's filling up some emptiness. 
[01:21:00]  There's some emptiness inside.  Yeah, apparently a lot.  You know what, sir?  Just cheat.  Just start cheating.  Cheating?  Just do it, seriously.  Just get, just start cheating.  Well, I'm a postal worker, and I've got a lot of postal girls that I see all the time,  and they start, they start flirting with me now, you know, it's kind of weird.  Well, it's postal groupies.  Yeah.  Definitely start cheating, sir.  She's not going to take care of herself, and she doesn't care. 
[01:21:30]  That's the problem is so many of these shows are telling women, like,  it shouldn't matter if you, you know, if you look good enough.  If you really love the person, you'll love them no matter what they look like or anything,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  If you really love the person, you'll love them no matter what the...  Ah, stop it.  I love the garlic butter song.  Sorry.  Oh, no, that's great. 
[01:22:00]  You know what the messed up part is?  Yeah.  Before we got married, I happened to sleep with the next-door neighbor, a friend of hers,  and she was kind of on the big side, you know.  But I was, like, really drunk that night, you know.  Cut diamonds in her back.  Yeah, you know, and ever since that, she's like, well, you've been with Patties before,  you know, and I'm like, well, I was with Patties.  I didn't marry a Pattie.  Dude, you got to tell her, look, I was pigging. 
[01:22:30]  That's what guys do.  Guys get drunk and go pigging.  We just pickle off anything.  Yeah.  No, we got to have, like, marriage contracts.  Like, really simple.  If your, like, wife or husband gains 30, 40 pounds.  All right.  I knew you were going to go there.  Gain an ounce.  You should be able to walk away from the marriage without the divorce courts getting involved.  Null and void. 
[01:23:00]  That's not what you sign up for, for your chick to, a few years later, be 50 pounds overweight.  You're talking about all kinds of things you can control.  Things you can control, like eating, things like that.  There's no excuse for it.  Maybe the sex thing.  Yeah.  There's just no excuse for it.  So, if you married a girl and she looked a certain way and then after a while she's just sitting there gaining weight, there's a big problem there.  You should be able to walk without any consequences. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  I will.  And what does she think?  What does she think?  That you're not going to look at girls that are more appealing?  Apparently.  And, you know, we brought another girl in the sack a couple of months ago, you know, and the other girl was skinnier than her.  And, you know, I kind of showed a little bit more attention to the other girl.  Brother.  It would spark something, you know.  That's funny.  His wife didn't take the hint when he put a pig mask on her and made her lie on the floor next to the slippers. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, wow.  Well, thank you, Brian.  Yeah, we got a girl on the line that actually agrees with what we just said.  This is awesome.  Thanks, Brian.  You guys take care.  Go find Bigfoot.  Lauren, Jersey, what's up?  Sitting on the couch.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I actually have to say that when a girl gets fat, I think she should actually, the guy should actually go to her and say,  you've become a disgusting pig and I want something else. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  I don't think bigger is better.  I never have.  And I'm really big, like, watching girls go into a Burger King and they already weigh 160 pounds.  Yep.  You can't get that.  Bigger is not better.  I don't care what anybody says.  It's just their excuse because they're lazy.  It's this phony sense of empowerment.  Like, we've talked about it before.  It's like, if you're married to somebody and they're going to get really big, well, you should have the right to say,  I don't want to have sex with someone that big and, or, or, you know what bugs me?  A lot of times women, like, women won't have sex with their husbands anymore.  Like, you know, they're just too busy taking care of the kids and I'm sure that's a huge responsibility. 
[01:25:00]  But if you're not going to give him any, you should just go out and cheat.  Cheat.  You should just go out and cheat.  Cheat.  Yay.  Get serviced.  Yep.  I agree 100%.  If you're going to marry a fat girl and she stays fat, good for you.  But if you marry her skinny and she gets fat, go elsewhere.  And the same thing's for women, too.  Like, if you marry a guy and he puts on a tremendous amount of weight, or if he's not having sex with you or he's not taking care of you at all and he's being selfish and disinterested and on the computer, go out and do what you've got to do. 
[01:25:30]  Which is what, Jimmy?  Cheat.  Cheating.  Absolutely.  Guys will, guys do not, guys do not want their chicks to get fat.  If they were skinny, slender, whatever it is, when they got married, they don't, like, years go by and then she gets fat.  The guy, first of all, it's taboo. 
[01:26:00]  They can't say anything.  You can't say, Jesus Christ, you got fat.  Then you just, now you're screwed.  So you have to kill him.  Absolutely.  The old elevator shaft.  The old oopsie.  All right, we should take a break.  I think, is Dennis here?  I know Adam's here.  We'll get Adam Farrar on the show next.  Shit.  Why does no one tell us when people are here?  I'd like a fax.  Fax.  Oh, we knew. 
[01:26:30]  We were just, that's just how it makes it sound cool out there for radio people.  By the way, I have a rash from my, whatever I'm using detergent-wise.  Oh, boy.  It's all over the lower part of my stomach.  You can't really see, but I can feel it.  You changed detergents?  I bought a new detergent.  I might have very sensitive.  This is one of these inane conversations that, what detergent are you using?  Because it could be the-  Well, the difference is I'm not talking about fluffing towels.  You're talking about a rash?  Yeah.  They would say, well, sometimes the baby's white son is white anymore, so I decide I  need it all temperature. 
[01:27:00]  Did you?  I'm talking about a physical malady.  And so you changed and it gave you a rash?  Yeah.  Remind me to tell you later how I made my girlfriend cry last night.  Again?  No, no, not sexually.  Just talking about my funeral.  Oh, man.  You're terrible.  There's your radio tea.  You are a torturous man.  She's PMS-ing and I knew it would get to her.  Oh, are you awful?  She's very sensitive.  She's very emotional right now.  Very emotional. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  We got a-  Oh, wow.  We had a girl on the line and she said she got married and the husband made her get fat.  That happens too.  You get these guys-  That lady's got to call back.  What's that about?  I'm afraid of being left.  Yeah, that's what they do.  They keep their women fat so that no other guys will really look at them and they won't  lose them.  And we got Mike.  You need some help.  Mike in Albany.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's going on?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, my girlfriend hasn't had sex with me in like six weeks, man. 
[01:28:00]  Really?  Every time I try, she makes some kind of lame excuse.  Yeah, she's cheating on you.  Wow.  She's cheating on you.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Damn, dude.  Who do you think she's cheating with?  Probably, I don't know, her ex-boyfriend.  You got a prospect, yeah?  Ex-boyfriend, you think?  I think so.  I found out she called him one night and she erased it off her phone.  Yeah, she's cheating.  She tried to lie to me about it.  Oh, boy.  Not necessarily cheating.  You can't for one phone call. 
[01:28:30]  It could have been anything.  I would say no, dude.  Yeah, but then she lied to me about it.  I called her out and she's like, no, no, no.  How old are you?  23.  And how old is she?  23.  Yeah, she's cheating on you.  Well.  Absolutely.  Where were you when the call was made?  Six weeks without sex and they're 23 years old.  She's cheating on them.  Yeah, where were you when the call was made, sir?  I was in the car.  We were in two separate cars and I called her and it was ringing and I could hear like  the beep, like, you know, she was on the other line. 
[01:29:00]  Uh-huh.  And we got home.  I said, who are you talking to?  She said, nobody.  I just didn't hear the phone ring because she didn't answer.  Uh-huh.  And so I was like, you know, BS.  And I looked at her phone and yeah.  Oh, you looked at the phone.  Yeah.  How long was the call?  But you said she deleted that call.  Well, she did.  She eventually did.  But I looked at it before she deleted it.  And then I didn't say anything to her and then she deleted it.  Yeah.  So what happened when she finally called her out on it?  Nothing.  She just said, oh, well, I didn't want you to get all worried about it. 
[01:29:30]  You know, it's no big deal.  And that was it.  And, uh, all right.  Does she still see the guy at all?  Where is he?  Does he live near you?  Yeah.  All right.  Then she's probably banging him.  I think so.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know, but it doesn't sound good.  We could call her and ask for you.  You want us to?  No.  You don't want to know, right?  We're good like that.  Well, she might get mad at me for that one.  So what?  She's calling her ex-boyfriend and lying to you.  How whipped are you?  Yeah, let's call her right now, sir.  How long are you dating her?  Um, about a year. 
[01:30:00]  And you're worried she's going to get mad on you?  She doesn't bang you for six weeks.  She calls her ex.  She lies about it.  And you're worried she's going to get angry?  What's wrong with men?  Well, we got a lot of people calling with their problems now.  I don't know what we started, but.  All right, Mike.  If, uh, we would love to call her for you, but it doesn't sound like you want us to do that.  We'll help you out, dude.  We'll be nice.  We're really good at this stuff.  Probably wouldn't get through anyway, though.  But the phone's busy.  What, buddy?  We did see Jimmy at Sweet Basil in Queensbury.  The show was great, man.  Oh, good.  Thank you for coming, man.  That'll make any couple feel closer. 
[01:30:30]  It certainly will, unless it's New Year's Eve in Long Island and you're coming to the North Fork Theater.  I mean, I'm not going to plug it, but I mean, if you want to, you go to Ticketmaster.  If you don't, break up.  It's a relationship.  I'm going to be there, too.  Thanks, Mike.  That's where I'm spending my New Year's Eve.  We're rushing toward a break, but I don't want to lose her again.  Becky in Jersey.  Got married.  Husband encouraged her to gain weight.  Right, Becky?  That's right.  What was that about?  You know what?  I was smoking.  I was hot.  So he just, you know, put on a few pounds.  You look better that way.  So I put him on, and they just keep going on. 
[01:31:00]  He didn't let me work, so I just sat home and ate, ate, ate, ate.  So finally, one day, I looked in the mirror, and I said, how can this man want to have sex with me?  I'm fat.  I'm a fat girl.  Wow.  What'd you do?  I divorced him.  I said, it's a sin to want to have sex with somebody that looked like that.  And then you lost the weight?  Well, you said...  I'm getting there.  I lost 30 pounds.  I got 20 pounds to go.  Wow.  Wait, hold on.  You gained 50 pounds in the marriage? 
[01:31:30]  I gained 50 pounds in two years.  How much did you weigh?  I weighed 130, but I'm tall.  I'm 5'8".  That's great.  5'8", 130, and you got up to 180.  I got 20.  Well, to one point, I was 205.  You're a kid or no?  205 on my 20th birthday.  205?  Can you send us a picture?  Can I send you a picture?  Yeah.  You guys can go on my MySpace.  What's your MySpace?  You guys can tell me my MySpace voodoo.  I'll request you guys.  MySpace voodoo. 
[01:32:00]  MySpace voodoo, baby.  Is that what you're pulling on your MySpace?  A little voodoo?  She lingers longer.  Do you know the name for Eric?  It's MySpace slash Frederica Bimmel.  All right, guys.  I'll give you a call back, but I'll definitely request you guys in the next five minutes.  All right, sure.  All right, thank you.  Now we got Tara mad because we're promoting cheating.  Tara, yes.  Good.  Hello.  Hi, Tara.  Hi.  I loved you guys up until the point you told people to go out and cheat.  That was me, Jim Norton. 
[01:32:30]  I said it.  Why?  I didn't say people...  I'm sorry.  ...to be cheated on.  I know it's horrible.  I didn't say go out and cheat on somebody who's just being good to you, but I'm saying  that there are people that will not have sex with their partners anymore.  Then leave.  Okay, fair enough.  Leave.  But if you can't leave because you can't afford the divorce or you can't afford to be away  from your children and you want to be with your children, just go out and bang.  No, that's wrong.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  You know what? 
[01:33:00]  110% wrong.  No, I'm not.  But cheating does more damage than leaving and not having time with your kids and paying  for a divorce.  Cheating does more damage when your kids find out.  Yeah, because you're going to get the kids and you're going to get the money and the divorce.  You're not a guy and most times it's women that are holding out.  What?  I'm going to divorce.  Oh, see this.  Dude, what...  Wait, hold on.  Did he cheat?  Did he cheat on you, sweetheart?  Did he cheat?  Oh, this could be a great combination, but her phone sucks. 
[01:33:30]  God, Tara, we can't hear you.  So, if you can hear this, Tara, we can't hear you.  Can you call back from the landline?  We cannot hear you.  I don't have a landline.  I'm in my car taking my kids to school.  Oh, there you go.  So, did he cheat on you?  He cheated on me.  We lived in Las Vegas.  Okay.  He cheated on me after 12 years.  How do you not?  After 12 years, which means he started three years in.  I worked.  I took care of the kids.  I was part of the PPA.  The whole Girl Scout mom.  The whole nine. 
[01:34:00]  You know what?  You know what?  That sounds very nice and great as a mother, but it doesn't sound very sexy.  No guy wants to bang a Girl Scout mom.  Mom in the PTA with the kids.  Don't give me four kids.  And the kids become so important.  Did you put a lot of weight on or no?  No.  I am the same way that I was when I got married.  Were you having sex with him?  Were you having sex?  Sweetheart, were you having sex with him?  Yeah.  Three times a week.  Okay, then this is not what I'm talking about. 
[01:34:30]  Okay.  He went out and cheated for whatever reason because he wasn't getting something out of the marriage.  I'm not talking about that.  Why women gain weight in a marriage?  Because their husbands are probably jerks.  No.  That's not why.  No.  They gain weight because they like eating and they've already landed their man.  That's not true.  Really?  So they just gain weight because he's a jerk?  I'll show him?  Huh?  When your husband makes you feel like crap, you go and eat a pint of ice cream.  Miss, stop making excuses for people.  Stop it.  You go to a bar and drink a couple of shots. 
[01:35:00]  How about personal responsibility?  How about the people when they feel like crap, they go to a gym or something?  Or they go for a bike ride?  Or they go for a run?  Work off the frustration.  That's a dumb excuse.  He makes me feel like crap, so I run and eat a pint of ice cream.  That's not true, miss.  That's ridiculous.  That's your problem.  I agree with you.  If you are in a mood, if you're in a bad mood, somebody makes you feel bad about yourself,  yes, you should do something positive to make yourself feel better.  But not everybody does that.  Right.  But stop making excuses for everybody's bad, destructive behavior.  And no one is talking about your situation. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not talking about a woman who takes care of herself and has sex with her husband.  It's a lame excuse.  You've got to take responsibility for yourself.  Yeah, you were giving up that old kid trough.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That kid flume.  There was apparently a gutter right into your lap.  Oh, boy.  A rain gutter.  You're not unhappy.  You sit down.  You have an adult conversation with the person.  Yes.  It's not working.  If she's not giving you any, you should just go out and just get hookers.  Just be safe. 
[01:36:00]  Our experience has been that a lot of guys get screwed in the divorce, so they have no  choice.  They do not leave because it's worse if they leave.  They lose the house.  They don't even get to see their kids anymore in some cases because they're holding a major  grudge.  Unfortunately, adults can't be adults when it comes to people getting divorced.  So they cheat and try to juggle and keep the marriage together.  It's a tough situation.  The kids.  No doubt.  But I'm sure the guy's not coming home guilt-free, but it's like he feels like he's trapped. 
[01:36:30]  How about giving him a little excitement?  How about realizing that it's a man's natural thing to go out and just impregnate?  That's what we do.  Oh, hello.  And that's fine.  I don't have a problem with that.  All right, Tara.  All right.  Bye, Tara.  We got to run.  We got to go commercial.  This is a great subject that we'll definitely pick up at a later date, maybe later today  or tomorrow or something.  Don't forget this.  This is where the listeners could really help us.  Yeah.  Remind us of this stuff and just call in with your stories tomorrow because we got Dennis  Leary in the green room with Adam Ferrara. 
[01:37:00]  We got to get them on next.  Okay.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  So off to a good start already.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Adam Ferrara and, of course, Dennis Leary in studio from Rescue Me.  Hi, guys.  Hello.  Really fast.  We got a girl on the line.  We started this right before the break.  I got to go to this call.  You guys jump in, please.  It's Ashley from Buffalo.  She's cheating on her boyfriend right now for the reason we said.  Guy's not giving her sex, so she said, screw that.  I'm cheating.  Let's say hi to Ashley real fast. 
[01:37:30]  Ashley.  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I just, I'd like to call in.  I just wanted to talk about the whole situation with cheating on your boyfriend and having  sex with his best friend.  Whoa.  That's a little dumb.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  We're with you.  That's not just, wait a minute.  That's not just, I'm not getting sex at home.  Shut up a minute.  Shut up a minute.  That's not just getting sex because you're not getting it from your boyfriend.  That's vindictive.  Yep.  Let me really screw this guy over sex.  His best friend? 
[01:38:00]  But it's not, yeah, it's his.  All right.  What kind of dog is his?  That's his best friend.  Oh, God damn.  Hey, Ashley?  Ashley.  Ashley.  Yeah.  Where do you live?  In Buffalo.  Yeah, so it has nothing to do with living in Buffalo, right?  It's really about your boyfriend.  It's not just complete boredom and it's going to snow 15 feet tomorrow.  The bills won't make the playoffs.  You know, everything's fine, though, between us.  And he just sometimes just doesn't want to have sex when I do.  So why not just go to the friend, right? 
[01:38:30]  All right.  Yeah, right.  The friend, though, man.  That's rough.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  You couldn't just find a stranger somewhere?  Like, that wouldn't even be.  That's dirty.  No, no, that wouldn't even be as bad.  Boy, you've got some convoluted morality going on.  It's dirty to meet a stranger and do it, but his best friend's okay.  Yeah, your vagina's mean.  You're using it like a weapon.  Well, I wouldn't even say that.  Hey, who's bigger, by the way, if you know what I mean?  It is bigger.  All right.  Who's bigger, the boyfriend or the friend? 
[01:39:00]  The friend.  Who's better in the sack?  But the boyfriend's great.  Oh, the boyfriend's great?  I just, you know.  This is really going to work out well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I see a gun and some CNN headlines.  Definitely.  Wow.  Murder, suicide today in Buffalo.  Body found.  They were shoveling snow in Buffalo.  In April.  When they found.  I'm no psychic, but I have a glimpse into the future.  There you go.  Yeah.  We're going to let you go. 
[01:39:30]  Two more really fast, then we'll get into what Dennis is all about and Adam's all about.  Christina in Boston, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I'm here with my husband, and we're going to pledge that if either of us gains 50 pounds,  the other one can cheat.  50?  Yeah, we got a new thing.  The divorce thing is rough on guys, so there should be just rules in place.  Like, if you marry someone and she gains like 30, 40 pounds, you should be able to just walk  without the courts getting involved.  It's like AppleCare.  If something goes wrong.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Does that work the other way, too? 
[01:40:00]  No.  Yeah.  If the guy gains 50 pounds, the chicken works.  Yeah, I see.  That's fair enough.  Sure it's fair.  As long as she doesn't gain 50 pounds also.  If they're both gaining weight, then they're both fat.  Jimmy thinks that she...  No, no, no.  If you're both gaining weight, that's like a mutually agreed upon, I don't know, some  kind of sick fantasy.  But I do think it should work either way.  One or the other.  Yeah.  If the guy turns into a fat slob and the chicken's still keeping herself in shape, she  can go out and do whatever she wants.  What's the weight gain?  Jimmy thinks 10 pounds.  I'm thinking...  10?  Jimmy's rough. 
[01:40:30]  Jimmy's rough.  Jesus, that is a...  Jimmy's a perfectionist, and rightfully so.  I'm saying I'd go 40.  10 pounds, but that includes pregnancy.  Jimmy should be in charge of hiring the waitresses at the Borgata.  It's definitely a job that suits you.  Well, we got a couple on the line.  It's like Rothstein and Casino putting them on a scale.  Yeah.  Christina, so you and your husband have made the pact today?  Yeah, we just made the pact on the way into work. 
[01:41:00]  We love you guys.  You could say anything.  I would probably agree with it.  But this is our pact.  If either one of us gains weight, the other one can cheat.  All right, now let's qualify that.  That's what I'm attracted to.  Let's qualify that, because if you or your husband immediately starts eating, you know,  12 packs of donuts, that's a different story.  It's not like, you know, passing, I just happen to gain the weight.  If you're trying to gain the weight, whoa, right?  Well, actually, I was, like, 40 pounds heavier before we got married, and then I sort of  said, you know, I don't want to lose my man, so I started to lose weight. 
[01:41:30]  I don't understand these women who, you know, sort of feel like they're comfortable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They trapped a man.  It's not fair to him.  He wouldn't be attracted to him.  That's very good.  Just be careful if he's, you know, if he's like, honey, come on, drink your mayonnaise.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  One more.  It's Carol.  Well, Dennis, before the break, we talked to this woman where the husband made her fat  after they got married, because he's a bit paranoid, because she was a hot chick.  Yeah, but chicks do that, too.  To the guys?  Chicks.  I've got a couple of friends where that's happened, where they start cooking food and 
[01:42:00]  making the guy fat so the guy won't, you know what I mean?  That's a different insecurity.  That is so weird.  They want to keep him through his stomach.  We got Carol in New York.  This is exactly what happened to her.  Carol, what's your story?  Okay, what happened?  I was very thin.  I was 5'4", 120 pounds, and then I started dating a guy.  When you start dating a guy, you go out to dinner all the time.  Okay, now you're going to get married, so now you've got to lose all that weight.  And then after you get married, now you've got to cook for the guy, and you've got fat  again. 
[01:42:30]  It's up and down.  Oh, come on.  Don't laugh at me.  It happens.  What a beautiful musical liltz you have.  Is your mouth full right now?  Yeah, you can hear the fatness, Adam.  Oh, you can hear the fatness here.  Am I honest?  Yeah, you're wonderful to listen to.  Oh, yeah.  Bye-bye.  And you know what?  This guy that you have on from Rescue Me, I don't know his name, but he is hot.  Tommy Gavin?  Dennis Leary?  You're talking about Adam Ferraro, right?  No, no, no.  It's Tommy Gavin.  It's Dennis Leary she likes. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Thank you, Carol.  She's looking at you like a buffet.  Dennis became...  Dennis went from being that obnoxious ass on MTV...  ...that would pop up to being a sex symbol.  He's sitting right in front of you.  No, but he was.  He was the guy on MTV that would come on with the cigarettes and blah, blah, blah.  And then all of a sudden...  And you found that obnoxious.  I did.  I love you myself.  And now I got to listen.  Every goddamn time I go over for the holidays, my aunt...  Oh, that Dennis Leary. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, come on.  Your aunt is a very smart...  My aunt's friend.  She's a looker, too, there, Dennis.  She loves you.  She's just like...  And she's constantly talking about you.  I'm like, what...  Remember what he was like?  Yeah.  Like in the MTV days?  Yeah.  You weren't like a chick magnet back then, really.  Like you're...  I, I...  You were a handsome gentleman, but...  Like I'm a chick magnet.  Your attitude...  Your attitude was a little, you know, raw. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  You know...  No, you are a chick magnet now.  I know.  Like girls just really...  Girls, that's the appeal.  They like the bad boy.  Yeah.  There's no good men out there.  Yes, they're raw.  You just don't pick them.  They like the friggin' bad boy, and they think, oh, the meth dealer wants to cuddle with me.  No, he doesn't.  No, no, what's great about Rescue Me, it's so obvious that Dennis Leary is the head writer.  It's so obvious.  Well, I'm not the head writer.  You're the head writer.  Who are you kidding?  I'm the co-creator.  You write your own...  It's a 50...  You write your own scenes, my friend.  No, no, no, no.  You're banging all the hot bras. 
[01:44:30]  Truthfully, it's a 50-50 proposition between myself and Tolan.  Yeah.  And I gotta be fair here, because Evan Riley, who was our writer's assistant on the job, and  then became, eventually, the third writer on Rescue Me, who's just...  I mean, there are episodes now which primarily belong to him as a writer, which takes a lot  of the pressure off me and Peter, but...  No, that's not true, actually.  But did he take a season off?  Because there was a season, I went through the box set recently, and there was a season  where you were naked every week.  What was that about? 
[01:45:00]  Well, he lost the weight.  I don't know which season he was.  He felt like he felt good.  He lost the weight.  He's like, I'm looking good.  I'm gonna write in some new scenes for myself.  I don't know which season that was.  I don't know.  I'm not sure, but...  They all blur.  Me and my chick noticed.  I was like, wow, he's naked again.  I like how he had to say, me and my chick noticed.  Me and my chick, yeah.  I know.  He threw that right in.  By the way, it wasn't me.  It was really my chick.  Yeah.  He pointed it out to me.  And I just, you know, oh, yeah, I guess he is.  I was like, is that...  Oh, you pointed out Dennis was naked.  I didn't even notice.  Hey, wait, Ant. 
[01:45:30]  Don't throw me under the bus, Ant.  It was start a whole conversation to start today's show that he's seen gay porn, and  most guys have seen gay porn.  I've never seen gay porn.  I've never seen it.  Wait a minute.  Let me...  I'll tell you this.  No, no, no.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Before he goes anywhere else with this.  I wonder, how did this come up in conversation, even?  I think it's our...  I think it's just our job.  This came up because I was talking about coffee table books.  We might be wrong about this.  My girlfriend bought this coffee table book that's nude women, like a black and white 
[01:46:00]  photographs, a photography book.  Yeah.  But then she also got another one that was romantic nude men.  And as she's unwrapping it, I go, I don't even want to look at this thing.  I don't want to look at it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait a minute.  She got this from who?  A bookstore.  Oh.  Yeah.  Did it come with the other book?  How did she present it to you?  She was like, oh, I was at the bookstore, and I got...  She wasn't buying them for me. 
[01:46:30]  She bought them.  And then I'm perusing through the woman's book, the one with the women in it.  And then she shows this romantic nude men thing.  And I go, I don't even want to look at it.  So she opens it up.  She goes, no, you got to look.  It's real sweet.  And there's this guy with his head laying on another guy's chest, and he's got his mouth  somewhere on the guy's chest.  It's just one of these things that I went like...  And I said, that to me is more disturbing than when you're on the internet and you see 
[01:47:00]  like just some hardcore, nasty, gay porno.  And I...  Okay, okay.  Okay, all right, okay.  I've been on the internet for years, and I've never come across...  You've never?  Never.  Now that...  I can't believe that.  What, it just pops up on your computer?  Sometimes, especially in an environment like this, and probably in an environment you work  in, someone pops it up there and goes, dude, check it out.  And it's just...  It looks silly.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:47:30]  It's not...  It never happened where I work.  Has it happened at rest?  I've never been on CNN and all of a sudden, prison break.  I'm not talking about CNN.  I'm talking about hanging out with a bunch of jackasses like this.  It was Derek over at XM.  You're blaming the staff of your show.  I am blaming the staff for showing me hardcore gay porno.  Okay.  Now, apparently, your girlfriend has seen that on your computer and thought, I'll buy this  car.  No!  That doesn't have to happen.  There's a gay guy blowing each other, and we will share it as a couple, and I will be  introduced to his fantasy world. 
[01:48:00]  She has a keystroke tracker, and she knows some of the things you've typed into your Google  search.  A fan.  No!  That's something to add, yes.  What happened is, I think Derek brought it up accidentally, and then moved on another  site, and Ant was like, wait, wait, go back.  Shut up!  The keywords!  Wait, wait, comma, go back!  I so did not.  And then we all started laughing, and he said, shh, this is getting good.  Why is Sam throwing me under the bus?  I think it's our occupation, because I think we might be wrong on this one. 
[01:48:30]  We just work with a bunch of freaks, I guess.  I don't know.  I think you should blame it.  But it is very easy.  Here's what your story should be.  Okay, help me out.  What do you guys, you work five days a week on this show?  Yeah.  How many weeks a year, 48?  Yeah, about that.  Yeah, I mean, it's like doing a talk show on television.  Sure.  You have to do a lot of work, and you have stuff to talk about.  How many hours every morning, four?  Oh, at least.  I would say, guys, eventually you run out of stuff to talk about, and I looked at the gay  porn, because I thought it would be a funny segment for the show.  That's your cover story.  And your sentence ends with, your honor. 
[01:49:00]  You've never seen anything gay on the internet.  Oh, well, see, now, what do you qualify as gay?  Because I've watched...  I don't know, like, look over there for a quick second.  That's called Lemon Party.  Whatever that is, it's blocked by Jim Norton's chair.  From my point of view.  That's called Lemon Party for some reason.  I thought we had you.  Well, now we do.  It's Arnold Palmer, and I don't know who else.  Mayor Koch.  You always try to decide who we'd want to be.  I would be him.  Why? 
[01:49:30]  Because he's getting from both ends.  He's getting a kiss, and he's getting...  Yeah, but you don't want the kiss.  And that brings it back to exactly what I'm saying.  The romantic gay book was more disturbing...  Than that?  Because there wasn't this romance in just the...  This guy's getting slammed.  It was just kind of funny to watch, and it wasn't a sexual thing watching it.  It was just kind of a goof thing to watch.  But then when they get into the tender moments things, that I cannot even bear to look at. 
[01:50:00]  There's just this...  He taps out there.  There's something inside a guy that just...  You can't look at that.  Okay, now...  Yeah.  This is probably the only time this is going to be a segue in either one of our careers.  Okay.  Speaking of coffee table, bloggers...  Oh!  Yes!  Let's take a left turn off your fantasy turn, Pike.  All right.  But you're going to confuse everybody out there.  No, I'm not.  They don't listen closely.  They're going to think that Dennis Lurie has one of these type of coffee... 
[01:50:30]  Listen closely.  It's that season you were talking about.  It's Christmas.  And coffee table books are available in all subject matters.  Genres.  Sure.  Genres.  And there's the ones that Anthony wants to buy, or his girlfriend wants to buy.  And then there's the Rescue Me coffee table book, which is coming out...  Heterosexual.  When's it coming out tomorrow?  I believe it's coming out tomorrow at the...  Seven.  Seven o'clock.  There you go.  Ah, okay.  We're doing a...  Are you doing a signing at...  Now we can talk about anything again.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're doing a signing at Borders, Penn Plaza, New York City, obviously, tomorrow from seven 
[01:51:00]  to eight.  Seven to eight.  It's the entire cast of...  Well, the main cast of...  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Very cool.  That's very cool.  It's in paperback and hardcover, so if you can't...  If you don't want to spend the cash for the hardcover version, you can get  the paperback.  Are you releasing them at the same time together?  Yeah.  It's actually a great book.  It's supposed to have copies there for you guys.  They should be here any minute, but it's actually...  It's a fan's book that we had very little to do with because the publishers took it over  and said, we're going to make it fanfare.  I don't know if you guys...  I was a big Sopranos fan. 
[01:51:30]  Absolutely.  Now, most of the time you get one of these TV or even movie books, you know, the coffee...  The Sopranos book, it had some great pictures, but most of it was just kind  of intellectualizing the show from David Chase's point of view.  And I bought it, and I was like, I don't want to hear what the writers think about it.  I want to see actual, like, my favorite scenes.  I actually wanted to read transcripts.  That was great about the Seinfeld book.  They actually just put the episodes out in book form.  This isn't actual full episodes, but it's your favorite scenes as chosen by the people  at the publishing company. 
[01:52:00]  And some of them are...  I mean, I even forgot how funny they are.  And it's tons of behind-the-scenes pictures, big, giant action sequences, and how those are  put together.  But mostly, though, it's just pick your favorite episode and your favorite scene.  And it's actually in transcript form for, like, three or four pages with pictures.  If it's a scene with me and Adam, it's pictures of me and Adam doing the scene.  And the exact, you know...  Yeah, it's great.  It's kind of like a fan book from a fan perspective, which is what Chase's book would lose because  it's kind of coming from a point of view that nobody's really in the camera.  I mean, I don't want to hear more about what David Chase thinks about the characters.  I've seen every episode at least twice in The Sopranos. 
[01:52:30]  Because I wanted to see, like...  I wanted to read the scenes.  Right, right.  Yeah.  And I wanted to see, like, the stuff that I saw on TV, then, like, them shooting it.  That's what I wanted to see.  How about the mother?  Was there anybody greater than the mother?  Nice language for your mother.  She was the greatest character in the show.  Great character.  I loved that show, man.  I just think that was the greatest television show of all time.  Did you like the ending?  Yeah, you know what?  I did love the ending.  And I'll tell you why.  The longer you sit with it...  You're not going to satisfy anybody.  At first, it sucked, but then...  There's no way to make everybody happy.  So he did what he wanted to do. 
[01:53:00]  Just like you guys, probably.  That night, I have to watch The Sopranos Live.  I could never watch it on tape.  I had to watch it at 9 o'clock.  Yeah.  And I was eating a sandwich when they went in the diner, and I was eating the sandwich.  And then I got kind of, like, nervous.  Like, hey, what's going to happen?  So I put the sandwich down, and I put my drink down.  I was still kind of, like, chewing the sandwich.  And it ended, and I was like...  Oh, man.  And I picked my remote up and tried to fix the TV.  And then I went...  Oh, he just said...  No, you didn't.  He just said, ask me to go screw yourself.  Right, right.  I thought it was great.  You know, the lead-up to the end, we talked about this a lot on our show when Meadow was 
[01:53:30]  trying to parallel park.  And you know, like, you're watching the clock.  Like, this is going to end great.  Park the effing car!  It was great.  It was great how it was shot.  I think Gandolfini, that, his, the job that guy did with that character is such a great  acting job that I think he should get the best acting.  No offense.  I say this, you know, from the point of view of being one of the nominees.  Even James Spader, I think, felt like, what am I doing with this trophy?  Gandolfini should win it for the next seven years, even though he's not on television 
[01:54:00]  anymore.  That's how great that character was.  Will he ever be able to work again?  Oh, yeah, I think so.  He's done enough stuff in between, too, you know, he's done, anything I've seen him  in, the character he played in True Romance, was that the one?  Yeah.  Oh, man, just brutal.  He was great.  But really great.  He's supposed to be great in Romance and Cigarettes, that new Dutero movie, which is  out, but you know, when you play on TV, I kind of think you've got to take a little  bit of time away from television.  Wasn't he in, I forgot the name of the movie, 8mm or something like that?  Yeah, he was in 8mm, too.  I just recently saw that again. 
[01:54:30]  Nicolas Cage ruined that movie, man.  That could have been a great movie.  Nicolas Cage has ruined a lot of movies.  I hate Nicolas Cage.  You know what?  I hate him.  He gets some great freaking, you know, movies, and he ruins them.  Leaving Las Vegas.  Well, you can't argue that one.  And Valley Girls.  Well, that was before.  You know what?  He was great in Valley Girls, and he was great in Moonstruck, and he was one of the  greatest character actors of all time.  And then, you know, you make that leap, and by the way, part of it, you can't blame  him, because when you make the leap and decide to be the $25 million or $20 million 
[01:55:00]  guy, you're going to get the mainstream script.  So, the power is out of your hands anyways, in terms of them being good.  They're middle of the road, at best.  Pop in on those indie flicks.  That guy was a great character actor, man.  He really was.  Yeah.  You nominated, dude, for Best Actor?  I didn't even know.  I don't follow the image.  Who?  You.  I've been nominated four times and lost, but that's okay.  Oh, that's great, dude.  Because I really, as a Sopranos fan, I've said it every year, and I voted for him every  year, Jim Gandolfini, Jim Gandolfini, Tony Soprano.  I mean, the line blurs with me.  Right.  So, when he didn't win it this year, I was just like, are you guys kidding me? 
[01:55:30]  They're probably just giving it to James Spader, because of what he made Robert Downey Jr.  do in Less Than Zero?  I never saw that movie.  Oh, there's an awful scene.  He made him have sex with other men for drugs.  He was great.  Spader rules.  It's in a coffee table book.  Spader's another great actor.  But come on.  When you want to match people up side by side by side, I don't know, man.  I just have a real hard time thinking that there was a better, you know, acting job  done in the history of television than Gandolfini playing Tony Soprano.  I prefer The Wire.  Great.  We have to take a quick break.  More with Dennis Leary. 
[01:56:00]  Where are we going?  No, you're staying here.  Oh, okay.  We're going to talk about Rescue Me and other things.  And let's not forget, the coffee table book is out tomorrow, and these guys are doing  a signing at Borders, Penn Plaza here in New York City.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Adam, Tatum O'Neill, oh my God, Callie Thorne.  Skurdy?  John Skurdy, Stephen Pasquale, Daniel Sinjata.  Wow.  I mean, it's like...  You got everybody.  Yeah, we got everybody.  From seven to eight, are you going to stay past eight?  Probably.  It's probably going to go for a while.  I imagine you'll have more than 50 people there.  There's going to be quite a line.  We're going to have at least eight people, because there's like eight of us in the past. 
[01:56:30]  There's eight of us.  So, are you bringing anybody?  You're going to be so annoyed to see how long the line is.  I'm going to say one thing.  This guy, the fact that he's still with you guys, unless you have some kind of blackmail  thing on him.  There's nothing to blackmail him with.  After his HBO special, it was one of the best ones I ever saw.  I figured he was gone.  I thought when he said something to you from the stage, and you guys got that...  That was our goodbye.  I thought it was the goodbye.  Yeah, that was just adios.  I'm off to bigger and better things.  Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you, man. 
[01:57:00]  We get cameos on HBO thanks to Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  That was a great special.  We take a...  And the book.  Happy endings.  I'm trying to write a book right now.  And when I bought his book, and first I read, of course, the intro from Quinn, which  I thought was historical, and I'm going, you know, I wonder what the book's going to be  like.  And then I was like, what's going on with Jim Norton?  He's like taking over the comedy world.  And then I saw the HBO special, and I was like, shit.  Yep.  But it's a great special.  We got to take a quick break.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:57:30]  Opie and Anthony with you.  Oi.  Dennis went to have a cigarette, and, well, the show's going to fall apart.  We're just going to sit here in front of mics and just go, daaah.  We don't know what to do, because they're not in studio.  I understand our books are arriving as we speak.  Oh, goody.  And they're back.  Goody.  That's all right.  We get time.  I'm glad he didn't hear that.  I know.  He's a big star. 
[01:58:00]  I got an announcement to make.  You have an announcement to make?  Yeah.  One of the publicists just gave me this.  The books apparently are like seconds away, guys.  Oh, good.  The first 50 people to buy the book and have it signed will get the full-season DVD set  of Rescue Me, third season.  The Red Sox have just signed Johan Santana to a 10-year...  No, I just made that one.  But anyways, if you come, if you...  First 50 people to buy the book tomorrow at the book signing at...  Wherever is it?  Where is it?  It's Portors.  It's at Penn Plaza.  It's right by Madison Square Garden.  It's very, very...  It's right at the Garden. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  So if you're the first 50 people in line, you...  Not only do you get to meet the cast and get it signed, but you'll get it signed  and get a full-season DVD set of Rescue Me, the third season.  That's really cool.  Hey, Dennis, I've got to ask you about the Pats.  Yes.  What do you think?  Well, I'm not a Patriots fan.  What?  I know.  This is a bizarro...  You are a Bruins fan.  You are a Red Sox fan.  I'm a Bruins, Celtics, and a Red Sox fan.  I obviously live and die.  Right.  So, when I was a kid, my older brother, Johnny, and I had always to share a room.  It's just the way the family thing worked out. 
[01:59:00]  So we were in an attic when we lived in a three-decker.  We were in the attic, which sucked.  Because you had to walk up three flights of stairs to get to the apartment, and then an  extra flight and a half to get to this attic hellhole where they put us.  And then when my parents actually bought a ranch house, my brother and I were put in  the basement next to the water heater.  I didn't think much of it.  Yeah.  We were like caved walls.  Like old Christmas decorations in the attic or the basement.  So my brother is three years older than me and a giant.  He's an ex-football player. 
[01:59:30]  He's a teamster.  And we just fought for the first 17 years of my life.  We had fistfights basically every day.  He always beat the crap out of me because he was huge.  And I never gave in.  And I never gave him the satisfaction.  I always just ended up smiling and just I melted his...  I did everything.  He had the huge record collection in his side of the room.  We had the tape down the middle of the room.  Oh, man.  And my brother got into a lot of stuff right before I did.  And one of those was psychedelics.  And so he didn't know half the time what was going on at a certain age.  And I would melt his records. 
[02:00:00]  Remember when you had records and that cool sound it made when it melted?  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes I would take them out and drive over them with the car and then put all the pieces  back into the sleeves so he could go to...  What a bastard.  Anyways.  Oh, that's great.  Why did I get into this?  Oh, the Pats.  Oh, the Pats.  So anyways, he was a Patriots fan.  That's when they were...  And that's why you didn't like him?  I purposely chose the Packers then because this is the late 60s when the Packers were  great and the Patriots sucked.  Just to get on his nerves, I ended up becoming a Patriots, I mean a Packers fan for life. 
[02:00:30]  So I admire the Patriots and what they're doing, but I'm really happy about the Brett  Favre, I don't know what drug he's taking, but man, is it working?  Amazing, right?  Story.  What is going on with him?  As a Packers fan, how annoyed do you get when they have to go, I'm a Cowboy fan?  How bad do you hate going to play in Dallas?  Well, I can never understand the America's team thing with the Cowboys.  Thank you.  You know, you get some guy from Jersey, Connecticut, Boston, whatever, and they go, oh, you know,  America's team.  I never understood that thing.  Why?  Because they had the cheerleaders first.  That was pretty much the only reason.  They're not America's team.  They're from Dallas. 
[02:01:00]  That's where they shot Kennedy.  How's that America's team?  I want the Pats.  I think Dallas needed a little boost after that.  Yeah.  They need a little help.  Something good.  I want the Pats to go undefeated.  I don't want the Dolphins to win.  I think that'd be a great.  Here's what I want.  Yeah, I'm with you.  I'm just a sick, twisted evil.  I want the Patriots, just because they were caught cheating.  Everybody cheats, by the way.  Thank you.  We said that.  I want them to go 16-0 just because they were cheating, just to prove that they don't need  to cheat.  They just got caught.  And I want the Dolphins to go in 16.  Yep.  And I want Ricky Williams to get caught with the biggest trunk full of weed in the history. 
[02:01:30]  More so than Mercury Morris.  More weed than Morris at Coke.  That's what I want.  That's going to happen.  That's pretty much it.  I don't want the Pats to go 16.  I don't like Belichick.  I don't like Belichick.  He's the greatest football coach since Vince Lombardi.  Stop it.  That mumbling guy in a flashed and sweatshirt.  He is a genius.  Bill Belichick is a genius.  Stop it with your ripped sweatshirt.  He's a genius.  He looks like a homeless guy.  You're in the NFL.  Take a shower.  Put on a suit and articulate.  Leave Bill alone.  What are you pissed about?  Eli Manning?  I'm a Jets fan.  You're a Jets fan.  There you go.  That's fine.  Now you know why he's pissed. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Bring it back.  Don't name it.  I was telling Dennis during the break.  I saw his new comedy recently.  Dennis Leary and Friends here in New York.  And then you did Comics Come Home.  And Jimmy was part of that up here in Boston.  Yeah.  Jimmy was great at that show.  Jimmy's always great.  He's doing a New Year's Eve show in Long Island.  North Fork Theater.  Tickets on sale now.  But anyway.  Yeah.  I was telling Dennis his new stuff is just amazing.  The energy.  I had so much fun watching you up on that stage.  And I told Dennis.  I'm like I got jealous because everyone was doing Larry Craig material.  But how he presented it on that stage. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know if you want to give it away because I don't know if you're still doing that stuff if you do more dates.  But it was brilliant.  You were play acting.  You were reading the story and play acting trying to figure out how this would make sense.  There's nothing to give away because you have to physically see it.  Which is part of my whole thing when I first heard about it was wide stance.  That was his defense.  And I was just like I've been in a lot of men's rooms and a lot.  I'm not one of those guys.  I'm not a Howie Mandel guy.  I can actually take a crap anywhere.  I've got to go.  I've got to go.  I've done it in a hole in the ground. 
[02:03:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm not a germ guy.  But so the idea of a guy going into a men's room.  I mentioned that on stage.  I mean you know those airport men's rooms in general are the worst places.  But I mean I'll go and take a crap.  But if I drop something on the floor I ain't picking it up.  And his whole thing about yeah I was picking up toilet paper or whatever.  Yeah toilet paper off the floor.  No you weren't.  No.  No.  Sorry.  And we know there's going to be about eight guys.  This whole week is going to be about at least another 15 guys coming out.  Coming out of the woodwork.  How about the guy that you can can you say. 
[02:03:30]  Whoa whoa whoa.  No you probably can't.  Oh boy.  Well if you have to ask that then I.  Yeah I know.  I would say probably not.  One of the guys that was involved with him was involved with the other guy.  The other Republican guy.  The evangelist.  The guy who went to the make me not a homo anymore.  By the way I love that you have a rehab joint.  They can say you know what you're a homo.  We'll fix you in 30 days.  Yeah.  You know you can give up booze.  You can give up drugs.  And being a homo.  How about that.  Homo rehab.  Homo rehab.  You know.  You want to shove a hot dog into your mouth.  You got to call your sponsor.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  It is just.  There's no way you can touch feet in a stall.  It just ain't happening.  Without.  Hey come on.  How many times have you been like at a dinner.  Like all you guys go out to dinner someplace and there's a cramped restaurant.  And you accidentally.  Sometimes maybe you're talking.  You don't even realize it.  That your knee is touching Jim's knee.  Yeah.  Right.  But you kind of feel weird.  Like we've both been touching knees for a while.  Why have we not moved.  Okay.  Now the moon now.  Like we all know those basic rules.  Yeah.  It's the homo seat rule. 
[02:04:30]  When you go to the movie theater and there's a bunch of seats.  Right.  And two guy friends.  You leave the seat in the middle.  Right.  I just did it the other day.  Yeah.  Do it all the time.  We went to see Imus doing his first show over there at a town hall.  That's exactly how we sat.  And Opie was sitting.  I came in.  You leave the seat empty.  Yeah.  I'm not going to sit next to him.  When your buddy says to you.  Hey I'm doing a special.  Like Jim Norton's HBO special.  Yes.  You really want to ask for three seats.  Don't you.  Of course.  But you can't get it because Jim's got a lot of friends.  You go okay we'll sit next to each other but we're not touching elbows.  We'll need the buffer seat.  But I'll lean to the right. 
[02:05:00]  He'll lean to the left.  Didn't you guys that night when I saw you on TV you had your girlfriends with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So wasn't it girlfriend guy girlfriend guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On television.  Oh absolutely.  Well we finally demanded that because there was another time Jimmy pointed us out in the  audience and they made Ant and I sit together.  No.  And our girl's behind us.  Like what's that about?  No.  No.  No.  No.  You can't do that.  It's going to happen.  You can't do that.  Either a girl or a buffer seat.  Yeah.  I realized that when I was like 4, 15, say 17 working with this black dude named Malcolm  and we all went to the movies and I didn't know it was like an empty theater so I sat  right next to Malcolm and he goes yo man I ain't your girl. 
[02:05:30]  He moved over one seat.  Sorry.  The other thing Dennis being a huge Red Sox fan.  Yeah daddy.  Your stuff on Joe Torre was brilliant too man.  Oh yeah Joe Torre with the ass cancer.  Basically explaining to everybody that he got ass cancer for this team.  He did get ass cancer for this team.  And they send him away.  You know.  I think if a guy gets you know Terry Francona had some kind of cancer too.  See that gives you an extra year with the team if I'm the owner.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Right.  But if you're Joe Torre I mean.  By the way that team had no right to even make the playoffs. 
[02:06:00]  How about the job he did last year alone.  Bringing the team back.  I mean they started it was one of the worst seasons they've ever had.  Yeah.  And he brings them into the playoffs.  Okay.  Didn't matter.  Yeah.  And he probably got some ass cancer and didn't mention it.  You know.  Got some.  He got a little bit of ass cancer but he didn't bring it up this time.  No.  He's a classy guy.  You know.  And that's going from a Red Sox fan.  I like Joe Torre.  And you were basically saying Boston people love Joe Torre as well.  How could he not?  Yeah man.  I mean first of all as much as I hate the Yankees. 
[02:06:30]  I'm with you.  There's no fun in winning.  I would have much preferred to beat the Yankees instead of the Indians in the playoffs.  And vice versa probably.  I'm sure for Boston.  Yeah.  Yankee fans want revenge.  And now Detroit got that big trade.  So that's going to up the whole division.  And you think Boston's going to pick up Santana?  I don't even want to think about it because I get too excited about this crap.  And they start talking about stuff like that.  I want the Indian kid.  You know the Indian kid that they have Jacob, Jacoby Elsbury?  I don't know if you remember this but they happen.  The kid's getting paid in beads basically. 
[02:07:00]  They mention the taco thing in the World Series.  They actually have a mic on somebody on the bench and he mentions to Elsbury that if you  steal a base everybody gets free tacos.  He goes out and steals like two bases.  This is how he's like I got beads and tacos.  I'm going to eat and I can trade the beads for some clothing.  I love this kid.  He may be involved in the trade.  And when he strikes out it rains.  I don't want the Yankees because one thing I hate about the Yankees is after Steinbrenner  was out when Gene Michael ran the team.  That's when Bernie was allowed to develop and all these young players.  I love Bernie. 
[02:07:30]  I hate when they go out and just Randy Johnson, I want it to bite my face.  That was the stupidest move.  And Kevin Brown and every other stupid move they've made.  They just buy these old men pitchers and he's still who?  I didn't want Kevin.  Kevin Brown got $100 million to pitch three innings in a Yankee uniform.  He did nothing.  He did absolutely nothing.  Randy Johnson, by the way, you know, he was a Cy Young winner and all that.  But he was, remember when he first came and he got in the pushing match?  Hey, you're in New York.  They should have a cameraman in your bedroom at night. 
[02:08:00]  In your bathroom.  It's New York.  You're getting $100 million.  Yeah, he copped an attitude.  Unless it was against the Yankees.  When he was with Seattle, he was great against him with Arizona.  Okay, by the way, it just proves to me that when the guy first started pitching in baseball,  in professional baseball, I said, you know what?  Half the time he strikes guys out because he's so ugly.  I think guys, they get to pitch, they can't bear to look at him.  You know what I mean?  And after a while, they got used to the looks.  And they're like, you know what?  He doesn't bother me so much anymore.  Jimmy got blown off for a picture with Randy Johnson.  Yeah, that stupid lumbering giraffe just walking down the street.  I was asking for a picture.  He goes, no, thank you.  I'm like, I wasn't offering you one, you jackass. 
[02:08:30]  I could take one.  We were at the Brooklyn Diner and you can't see heads go by because you're up high.  And all of a sudden, we're just eating and we see this head.  One head.  One head float by.  One ugly head.  And it's a crowded street.  So Jimmy and I are like, oh my guys, Randy Johnson, we run out.  And it was so awkward when Jimmy's like, can I have a picture?  And then Randy's like, ah.  So I got a picture of Jimmy with Randy Johnson walking away.  Was he by himself?  Yeah.  He's a total douche.  And every Yankee I've met has been a douche except for Giambi.  Okay, now let me ask you because you probably know this.  You know who Barry Katz is?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so Barry Katz. 
[02:09:00]  Now, is Randy Johnson not the Barry Katz of baseball?  It's the same head, basically.  Just a lumbering man with a tiny, he does have a big, he has like a brontosaurus head.  It's just too small for his awful body.  It's Barry Katz minus the ponytail.  I'm going to bring this around because we're running out of show.  We are?  One of the first copies is in my hand.  Yeah, you got it, guys.  Hot off the press.  I was just thumbing through it.  Besides the bookstore having them in boxes right now, those are the first three or four  copies to be.  I don't even have one yet.  It feels warm still.  You guys got one before me.  It's actually really. 
[02:09:30]  I was looking through it.  Very cool.  The pictures are great.  Really good pictures.  And then the behind the scenes stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the stuff I like seeing.  And like, there's something about seeing you guys sitting around and talking.  You know, you talk with the other writers or director or just sitting in your chairs  laughing with each other.  Or on this set, smoking.  Smoking.  I'll tell you something.  When we say this is the smoke in this cast going, we're not just talking about the chicks.  Including the chicks, everybody in this cast smokes.  Is there anybody who doesn't? 
[02:10:00]  Lenny smokes cigars.  Cigars.  But that's it.  I mean, there's no non-smokers.  They totally smoke cigars.  Wow, really.  I love everybody.  I mean, girls, guys, everything.  Dude, this is great.  Children.  It's insane.  Yeah, even his kids.  The kids are coming in.  Unbelievable.  No, this is great.  It's like having Finster on the set.  Yeah.  There's my side.  Now that your older daughter on the show is getting very attractive.  Well, because she's like 24 now.  Yeah, I know.  It's just noticing.  How old is your girlfriend?  Your current girlfriend? 
[02:10:30]  28.  Yeah, okay.  Let me just say, I want to say this right to you now.  In my band, my guitar player, Adam Roth, who I've known for 30 years, who's my age,  is now dating a cute, sexy, funny, smart 28-year-old.  And yesterday, he was bitching about some regular stuff we all bitch about, you know,  phone bills, this and that.  He went, excuse me, you're 50, you're dating a 28-year-old.  Shut up!  Shut up!  So I'm going to say the same thing to you, okay?  You can no longer, to me, complain about anything. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Okay?  How old is your girlfriend?  I met her.  25.  I said, oh my God.  You know what?  Your show should be taken away from me.  That's it.  Really?  Seriously?  That's unbelievable to me.  Shut up and look at the gay coffee table book.  How old are you now?  I admit to 30.  What do I know?  Please.  38.  All right.  So he's a 40-year-old.  Yeah.  A 45-year-old blonde guy.  I can't.  I don't even know.  Hey, I don't see you hooking up with my Aunt Fran.  How old is she?  Older than you probably, Dave. 
[02:11:30]  Okay, so forget that.  I'm just saying that you guys have no right to bitch about anything.  You're right.  Yeah.  We don't bitch about our girls.  Yeah, I know.  That's the one thing we don't bitch about.  I know.  I know.  I picked up on that.  I'm very happy.  I was trying to figure it out.  Now I know.  Hey, my girlfriend's 29.  I'm going to go home and fire the old bag.  The old.  Oh, you're evil, man.  It's really.  You guys, really.  I mean, when people wake up in the morning and they count their blessings, you two should  be, I don't know.  They should come and take away whatever you have in your apartment.  My life is true. 
[02:12:00]  My life is great.  You know?  Hey, uh, leave me.  You guys got fired because you basically pissed off God, right?  You couldn't find work for how many years?  You would be at divorces, multiple failed relations.  Look at what's going on.  I know.  You're making more money.  You've got two radio shows, a 28-year-old and a 25-year-old.  I'm writing a letter to dear God.  What happened with the St. Patrick's thing?  What are you doing here?  I thought you were supposed to punish these guys.  All I could think is there's going to be hell to pay in the afterlife. 
[02:12:30]  Apparently.  Oh, really?  It's going to be bad.  We're just getting started, but we're really running out of show.  I want to make sure everyone picks up Rescue Me Uncensored, the official companion.  Look, you know what it is?  It's a coffee table book.  It's the kind of book that you can...  Not a lot of words, which I like.  Yeah, it's easy reading.  I don't mind reading, but sometimes I don't want to read.  I want to prude.  Well, the script excerpts are great.  No, I know.  There's enough in there.  Hey, if you're a guy...  I'm not going to get bogged down by the reading.  If you're a guy, you could take this into the bathroom in the morning, and you could be in  there for 15, 20 minutes.  That's good for your dad, your boyfriend.  And then, if you're a chicken, you'll like the show.  There's plenty of hot shots of Sinjata and all of the hunky guys. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, tell us more.  Yeah.  The hunky guy.  But, you know, if you're like 50 and you have a 25-year-old girlfriend, I would say buy multiple  copies of this book and thank your...  It's one of those books where if you're in the bathroom and you're reading it, you get  up and you feel like a newborn fawn.  And your legs are numb.  Because you're just going to sit there and look at it for an hour.  This is coming in like crazy.  Rider Strike, what does that mean to Rescue Me before we end today? 
[02:13:30]  Well, you know, you've got to wait until it's over.  You've got to wait until it's over.  When were you supposed to go back?  Already?  We were supposed to be riding now and start shooting in January.  So, you know, I'm keeping our fingers crossed.  That means Dennis Leary will be on the road doing his comedy.  Hopefully, I'll be riding Rescue Me.  That's what I prefer to do.  But if the strike's going to go for a long time, yeah, I am going to go out on the road.  And Adam, you're going to be at the Improv?  Hey, did we mention the song?  Which one?  Oh, yeah.  Rehab.  Yeah, we played it before.  We played it.  Yeah, so what is it?  Actually, we're calling it Rehab.  What?  At the Rehab?  At the Rehab. 
[02:14:00]  At the Rehab.  I don't know where it's going to be, but it'll be there soon.  iTunes.  Probably iTunes, right?  And some other places.  And Adam Farrar is going to be at the Improv Comedy Club December 13th through the 16th.  At Hollywood, Florida, yeah.  Hollywood, Florida.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Guys, thank you very much.  Thank you, man.  Always a pleasure having you in, man.  Dennis Leary, Adam Farrar.  Thanks, guys.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:14:30]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:15:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  Adam Ferrari made the walk.  Hello.  There you go. 
[02:18:00]  There you go.  Adam made it.  Dennis has a thing.  My kids aren't playing hockey today.  He's got the thing to do.  His kids are playing hockey?  Yeah.  Is that a game today?  I believe him, actually, because he always does the walk with us.  Oh, he loves this side.  Yeah.  He does love this side.  He loves being able to curse.  That's the thing about smoking.  Because every time I come to see you guys, if I want to have a cigarette, I've got to have  it outside.  He's in the green room smoking.  I said, oh, okay.  So I get to light up.  He smoked in a hospital.  We had a scene in a hospital. 
[02:18:30]  And he's standing next to an oxygen tank having a cigarette.  And I said, Chief, you know, that's oxygen.  Yeah, I'm blowing the smoke the other way.  Don't worry about it.  Blowing the smoke the other way.  Like, it matters.  Two things.  First of all, we will hear about Dennis Lurie smoking.  Whatever.  Right.  We will, though.  It's just how it is over there.  And secondly, I think Dennis is one of those guys where he's going to be smoking right  up until 90 years old.  Yeah.  I think he's going to be one of those guys.  And nothing will happen to him.  Where he's not affected by the cigarettes.  Well, I don't know that you think this Dennis is a Superman. 
[02:19:00]  You were talking about one of your friends like that and your mother has to pipe in.  I don't know why you think he's just this Superman person.  Person.  But I really.  Who is this Dennis?  Who, does Dennis clean your underpants?  If Dennis jumped off a bridge.  Yes, I would, Mom.  The amount of smoking.  If Dennis paid me $80,000 a week, I'm sure he's making, I'd jump right with him.  I'd grab his cock and hold it on the way down.  Yep.  He's 50.  Still smokes like a chimney.  I forget.  I keep thinking he's like in his 30s, man.  Yeah.  The energy he had on the stage when I last saw him, I'm like, wow, the cigarettes aren't 
[02:19:30]  slowing him down whatsoever.  He wants to play.  He wants me to join his street hockey team.  He's like, hey, you ought to come down and play some street hockey.  I was just trying.  Like, what?  Yeah.  Dude, I was just trying to, you know, like, you know, kind of relate.  I'm like, you know that hockey thing you're into?  I'm into hockey.  You're a Bruins fan.  I'm an Islanders fan.  I play a little street hockey.  Next thing I know, he's signing me up for some roller fucking inline skating hockey league.  He goes, oh, you're going to be playing with us next year.  I'm like, no.  And I'm not even going to sit here and make believe that I could possibly do that. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I did a little street hockey.  That's what I mean.  A little street hockey.  He had the benefit every year with the celebrity hockey game.  Right.  Ice skate at the Garden.  We ice skate against the Bruins.  He's like, in one year, he's like, come on, Adam.  You're going to play?  I go, no.  Italians.  Phil Esposito is the only Italian that plays hockey.  We invented the Zamboni.  You guys got it.  Right.  I ain't doing it.  Who's this Dennis?  Is he a superhero hockey player?  Oh, well, we got another installment of What Renee Thinks is Funny. 
[02:20:30]  I just saw that.  Oh, that's a fave.  We got a woman upset with her butt implants.  Oh, no.  We got...  Was it a dick?  That might be a lie.  True.  It was implanted against her will by a black gentleman.  Her butt implants.  Her butt implant was named Renee.  We got a lovely woman out there in the bleachers that doesn't look too excited to be here.  Not you.  You're lovely, too, though.  You look excited to be here.  Yes.  She's my favorite.  It's my best friend.  That one looks like...  Ugh.  Why am I here? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, you never know, though.  I mean...  Brazil girl.  I bet you that Dennis Leary friend of yours would be happy to be here.  My mother would say his name wrong.  That Dennis Leary.  What does that Dennis Leary think?  She uses people's names wrong.  Really?  Which one is she?  Joe Pesky.  Joe Pesky.  Because he's pesky.  He's pesky, mom.  Look at Joe Pesky.  Yeah, my mother uses the the.  I saw you on The Rescue Me.  Really.  The Rescue Me.  The Rescue Me.  No, it's all insane.  Yeah.  No, what's cool about Dennis Leary, before we move on, he is very aware of what we're doing. 
[02:21:30]  He's extremely aware of what Jimmy's doing.  Oh, yeah.  But he's stand-up, so stand-up's kind of checking each other out.  I just kind of need to know someone that famous is, like, paying attention.  That was very nice what he said.  That was, and I thanked him for saying it as he was leaving.  I'm like, that was nice.  But he goes, no, I was telling you the truth.  But, I mean, it was still nice to, it still makes you feel really good.  It's nice to hear.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel great.  Oh, Dennis Leary's opinion is all important.  I guess the Dennis Leary is more important than your family telling you you're doing fine. 
[02:22:00]  As a matter of fact, it is.  Apparently, the Dennis Leary's in charge of your happiness.  The Dennis Leary.  Oh, Dennis Leary.  Hey, we've got to end this storyline we started about a week ago.  Tim in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, just want to remind you guys about the hole from San Francisco being on The View today,  supposedly.  Oh, yeah.  I was out that day.  Was Darren O'Toole supposed to be on The View today, or was that tomorrow?  Was it the fifth or the sixth?  The fifth, right?  I thought she did the fifth, yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Why'd you guys fight with her in a nutshell?  Because I honestly, I read about it on one of the message boards.  Briefly, yeah.  It was the fact that she had gone in the paper, some publication.  It was some little fucking rag.  It was a radio rag.  Yeah, radio rag.  And she writes like we're friends, and she knows us.  And we met and spoke and talked about things.  We never uttered a word to her in my life.  We never saw her.  Yeah.  Did you guys make the bet?  Yeah.  I tried, but she wouldn't take it. 
[02:23:00]  They were almost like backhanded compliments without the compliment.  Sure.  Like without even being able to put a compliment in.  That's pretty much an insult.  It was just the backhand.  Yeah.  And saying she has inside sources, and they're, believe me, they're not happy with those two.  And they're, and what, they have migraines, and they need Valium, and I don't know.  She sounds funny.  She's crazy.  She's nuts.  There's something wrong with her.  And she said she's going to be on The View today.  Yeah.  She was going to be co-hosting.  The Darren O'Toole on The View update. 
[02:23:30]  What do you got, E-Rock?  Well, she called last night.  Oh, she did.  Much to, uh, with my girlfriend in the background screaming, get off.  Excuse me.  Are you fucking her?  What?  My girlfriend?  No.  Darren O'Toole.  No.  No, he's fucking this show by working for her.  Oh, shit.  Swimwalk.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  She called you last night.  She called last night.  Shut up for two minutes.  I haven't heard from her since she was on the show. 
[02:24:00]  She's not going to be on The View today.  You fucking Darren O'Toole?  No.  You fucking Darren O'Toole?  You could have said anybody, but you said you and Darren O'Toole.  Yeah.  That meant something, E-Rock.  That meant something.  You said you, you said her.  What kind of sex are you having with Darren O'Toole?  Even you don't know what you meant by that.  Get your fucking stomach out of the way.  I can't even see the TV.  He's falling on deaf ears.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  He has no clue what movie you're referencing.  Of course he doesn't.  Jesus, you chick.  I know. 
[02:24:30]  If I did a fucking, if I did a waiting to exhale line, he probably would have tagged it.  I'll fuck you right in the mouth.  But there's some sex going on.  Is it phone sex, cyber sex?  No.  What kind of sex are you having with Darren O'Toole?  What are you doing with her?  There's nothing going on.  There's too much communication going on.  No.  What's up?  What's going on?  She called last night to complain about you.  Is she jerking you off?  Complain about you?  She's jerking him off.  Getting a handy?  Getting a handy from Darren O'Toole?  No.  Did she ever spit in her hand and just grab your cock a little while making eye contact  and tell you what a good job you do, how you're underrated?  Are you getting your balls tickled by Darren O'Toole? 
[02:25:00]  Oh, we lost the guy.  Did she ever lick your ass and tell you it tastes like bologna?  Oof.  What kind of sex you got with Darren O'Toole?  Yeah, nothing.  What's going on there?  Yeah, tell us.  Something's going on.  What do you got?  Okay.  You don't want to hear the news.  Yes, we do.  Oh, he's threatening us.  Are you threatening me?  Oh, rock.  Oh, easy.  Rock.  Well, you can just run into her on the street then.  What?  Yeah.  She's here?  Maybe.  I don't know.  Bring her in here.  She wants to come on the show.  She's actually staying across the street.  And she'll come over today? 
[02:25:30]  She flies in tonight, I believe.  And why isn't she going to be on The View?  She didn't tell me.  She's staying at the Park of Meridian?  So why is she complaining about it?  She said it's still open for her to go on that show.  Wait, why was she complaining about them?  Yeah, because they don't book a week in advance.  No, she complains about him.  It's still open for her to go on?  Like, what?  That's the way it is.  She can just walk in when she wants?  They call you day of.  Hey, you busy?  Come on.  I get a lot of people obsessed with me for whatever reason.  It's bizarre.  No, I don't know what it is.  Look at the eyes on you. 
[02:26:00]  I thought it was the charming cheekbone.  That's all part of it, but it leads up to those baby blues.  Let me just rest my nuts on your knee.  Come here.  You have eyes like a robin.  Look at you.  Hey, it's not about me, though.  Obviously, E-Rock's going to be, you know, he's going to be working late tomorrow, right?  He's the point man.  Hotel sex with Darren O'Toole?  I'm going to a book signing tomorrow.  Oh, that's the excuse.  That's good.  That's good, E-Rock.  That's good.  You know where she's staying.  I've got to be at the Dennis Leary book signing.  That's smart.  You're going to forge all the signatures and then sign Darian's face with your cock.  Wow, that was a long way. 
[02:26:30]  Are you going to be doing some?  Yeah.  That's quite the journey.  For nothing, though.  For no payoff at all.  You brought a lunch.  Are you going to be doing some pegging?  You're going to be doing some pegging with Darren O'Toole, right?  Yeah.  Is that it?  No.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Why was she married at Opie?  A little bit.  She's bringing the strap on, right?  You're going to do some of that pegging?  No.  What is that?  It's not pegging, by the way.  It's pegging.  Is that Darian's MySpace and I see E-Rock is in the top friends?  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:27:00]  Someone said I brushed over this.  What was your girlfriend saying in the background when Darian O'Toole called?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  She was screaming, you're crazy and shut up.  I had the phone on speakers.  To you?  No, to Darian.  Oh.  Why was Darian complaining about Opie?  Because that's all she does since he yelled at her.  Okay.  That's, she, she's, I think, it's beyond obsession with her.  Like, she knows his history too well for just for being another radio person.  She's got a crush on me.  But she, she swears, she, she wants a list of where and when she met you.  Hold on, E-Rock.  Greg raises a good point. 
[02:27:30]  I call you Greg in moments like this.  Where a couple of men are straightening things out.  Yes.  Taking rumors to cast.  Excuse me.  Wait, let Jimmy, uh.  Clarify, please.  Just, he's crushable.  Even if you're not gay, does it, like, like, like women, men, everybody looks at that and  goes, you know, I wouldn't mind just a neck kiss.  No.  Not necessarily a fuck.  That'd be queer.  I'm so sick of being hit on, I don't even leave my apartment at this point.  Absolutely.  That's how lovable I am.  The doorman hit on him.  Yeah.  They give him a little pinch on the fanny.  So what, yeah, she has a crush on him, you think?  She, she, she's obsessed with the fact that. 
[02:28:00]  You sound thirsty.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  She's obsessed with the fact that Opie doesn't know who she is and she swears up and down that she's met him.  She, she knows him.  They've talked all the time.  I, I actually, I don't know.  This is what I know of, uh, Darren O'Toole.  And I came to New York and I don't know when she came here, but it was early on.  19-0-7.  And she, uh.  Circa.  I just like saying aught.  And, uh, Q104, uh, put her in mornings and she failed miserably.  And she was supposed to be like the female Howard Stern. 
[02:28:30]  That's how they, like, uh, promoted her.  And that's all I know.  Mm-hmm.  Well, she's.  Did she have a career before that?  I really don't know.  I assume she would.  I mean, I assume she did like most radio guys and were in a bunch of dumb markets.  And then I know she went to San Francisco because, I'll give you the whole history, because we got the tape of her sounding really fucked up.  Right.  Uh, and David Tell was in and he's going to be on our show tomorrow, matter of fact.  And we'll, uh, talk to him about that, perhaps.  Mr. Man!  Mr. Man! 
[02:29:00]  Hey, by the way, I read something she wrote.  Not, was it on a MySpace or something like that?  Uh, I don't remember why I linked to it.  Huh?  From Whackbag or whatever it was.  And, uh, it was just, like, not really great writing.  Like, that's what, I don't know anything about her except for the fact that, uh, it wasn't funny writing.  It was kind of corny on the MySpace.  Yeah, she's, uh, from talking to her.  I remember that one time on the phone, because that's the only time we've ever spoken.  Um, she didn't come off as, uh, sharp or witty or anything.  She came off as a little weird.  She's coming in tomorrow.  Like a weirdo.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, uh, uh, you do sound, uh, you sound thirsty.  Let me get you a, uh, Opweiser.  There you go, you're off.  Ah.  Enjoy.  Thank you.  Oh, God, is that fucking douche-inducing.  Those fucking, that, what do they call it, the guys?  Oh, Lope-Wiser.  Lope-Wiser.  Lope-Wiser.  Lope-Wiser.  A Lope-Wiser should be a shot of cum directly delivered to your fucking tonsils.  Fucking awful.  They did make fun of you, too.  Nothing but thrill.  I, but I just, that's all I heard about it.  I didn't hear, I never heard it.  Eh, they'll fail miserably. 
[02:30:00]  Uh, but.  And I'll be proven right again.  I'll just write about to do my new book.  So annoying to be right all the time!  I know.  Anyway, so, uh, is your, uh, is your girl, uh, jealous of Darren O'Toole?  No, not at all.  She thinks she's insane.  But she, she's like, rar, rar, rar, with the claws, right?  Rar, rar, rar.  That's nice.  Your woman's fighting for you.  And says hi to Renee when she comes in, because she's a girl.  I, I love E-Rock's, uh, chick.  Mm.  I know.  It's like she doesn't understand how hot she is  and what a pile of shit she's fighting over. 
[02:30:30]  No disrespect to you.  None taken.  Don't even worry about it.  He's so out of his fucking league with her.  She can't understand why another girl would like this pile of shit.  Oh, wow.  This is my pile of shit.  I like the fact that she's defending her pile of shit.  Right.  That's beautiful.  Here's what it is.  Your father must have called her and said,  Look, I understand that he's a mush,  but I'm worth a lot of money.  Just stick with it.  If he dies, it'll be yours.  I'm going to wire you a million dollars,  but let's keep it between you and I.  Just keep my boy happy. 
[02:31:00]  We thought he was a fag until he met you.  Please just defend him as you would a real man.  Just make sure he has his ba-ba every night and we're all good.  What got her?  I don't know who you think you're going to get besides her.  What got her?  Was it the picture of you on a speedboat with your glasses?  Cool, huh?  Pretty cool, huh?  Was that it?  No.  No?  Has she been on the speedboat down there?  Once.  Once?  Yeah.  She'd go real fast.  What was the picture with the speedboat with the glasses?  Oh, it's actually my desktop picture on my laptop over at K-Rock. 
[02:31:30]  And every morning I boot up and it says on top,  the boys, of course, put pretty cool, huh?  And it's just E-Roth, just cruising, hitting some manatees.  I got to read the open letter to Opie.  He took it off?  Open letter to Opie.  I'll read the open letter to Opie. 
[02:32:00]  Let me just back up a little bit.  Who wrote that?  Darian O'Toole.  This is an obsession going on.  Single white Opie.  Hey, Darian O'Toole, don't you know?  All right, Jimmy, for you.  She sounds to me like she wants to cup your bag and give you a dick in deep sucking.  Banging with a shillelagh.  Open letter to Opie.  WTF?  Exclamation point.  Okay, that's an exasperated what the fuck.  What the fuck?  Okay.  All right.  Cool.  Is that the whole thing?  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  I like that.  She gets to the point.  She doesn't fuck around.  In case you missed it, here's the Darian log, just like Star Trek, but cuter.  All right.  Like Captain's Log, but it doesn't even...  You need music.  You need either Star Trek music.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get some Star Trek music.  Let's go.  Let's wake up in the booth.  Exactly.  He's not even paying attention.  Darian's Log.  That'd be you, Butcher.  Why would you pay attention?  Why?  Okay, I'm going to ask again.  No disrespect to Butcher.  Why is Derek not doing that job?  I'm fucking tired of hearing. 
[02:33:00]  He was very good at it.  Butch is not bad at it, but Derek was great at it.  Derek is still waiting for his hearing to come back.  That's true.  He is a blind, deaf idiot.  All right.  Oh, my goodness.  I love Derek, but he cares shit.  There's a hearing issue with Derek right now.  Derek makes production now, full-time.  Steve, what is it?  Why is Derek doing production full-time?  Steve, please, he's got to be doing production full-time.  What?  We don't have another person that can do the kind of job that Derek does.  We can't.  Oh, I didn't realize.  You didn't realize.  Oh.  Eric is actually...  Eric is supposed to be on the board during the XM portion of the show. 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  I didn't realize.  Oh, okay.  But Derek was very good at it.  I understand that, but he's better at doing production.  I'm going to defend Butch.  Butch usually does a very good job.  I'm not knocking Butch.  He wasn't paying attention at the moment.  He's looking very angry.  And I'm scared of people like him, so I'm going to stick up for Butch.  I've asked this before, Butch.  This is not going to do with Butch.  It's not about Butch.  I don't know Butch.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to see him.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  This is about Derek.  Before Butch was doing this, I asked, why is Derek doing production when he just had 
[02:34:00]  that weird sync thing where he was always doing a good job on the air?  Why is he doing production full-time when he could be here doing this?  Derek does...  I'd rather have him do production for the show.  Oh, I don't think he's valuable on that.  He is live on the air.  But then who does production for the show?  No, I like E-Rock.  He did it right after the show.  I like E-Rock on that board.  You can't start production at 11.05?  No.  At 11.05 and then stay here another eight hours?  Another eight hours.  It's a full-time job, Jim.  I don't...  I'm sure it is.  I swear to you, it's a full-time job.  But if it doesn't sound good on the air, what good is great production if less people  are listening because it doesn't sound good on the air? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, on the air.  On the air is number one always.  I understand that.  Did you want to hear if I was...  This is a perfect example.  Oh, boy.  Let's stop it, but it's a good question.  We got to...  I was getting sad.  It's just a basic...  It's a question about if I was like doing...  Or any performer was doing an hour or less going, yeah, but I'm writing for tomorrow.  You go, I don't give a fuck.  Write on your own time.  You got to be good on the air now.  No, I can't sit here and be quiet and go, look, you guys talk for the next time I'm  going to write.  Derek's producing stuff that's got to be on the air today.  Butcher does good. 
[02:35:00]  I'm not saying Butcher doesn't.  They both do good.  E-Rock, yeah.  But by the way, Darren O'Toole is...  Darian O'Toole is ripping off E-Rock's what the fuck.  That's being brought up.  Oh, that is the one to pay attention today.  What the fuck?  Where's E-Rock?  This is for him.  He's the one fucking Darren O'Toole.  I'm not.  I'm just fucking reading this letter to me.  Now, Butcher, you understand this is not a reflection on you.  Okay, he's smiling.  He's happy.  He is.  It is.  By the way, what I just said, I don't know.  Because she's a psycho broad.  I don't need a lawsuit.  About what?  I said that E-Rock's fucking her. 
[02:35:30]  He is.  I have nothing to do with her.  Oh, E-Rock.  He's just thumbs up.  Yeah, why the thumbs up, then?  And then he pointed towards his ass.  Apparently, it's shit erection or nothing for you, huh, kid?  The reason he had the thumbs up, he was letting the garlic butter saw...  Garlic butter saw!  Kind of just make its way down into his hand.  Monday, November 26, 2007.  Open letter to Opie.  WTF?  Exclamation point.  That means what, Jimmy?  It's a question, but it's an exasperated...  Yeah, that is exasperated. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  It's like, what the fuck?  That's what it's like.  All right.  In case you missed it, here's the Darien log.  Just like Star Trek, but cuter.  I like her.  She's got spunk.  I wish I could do Star Trek voices.  Nah, it's just...  All right.  Darien's log.  Captain Cunt.  7.30 a.m.  7.30 a.m.  Pacific.  Sound asleep.  7.50 a.m.  Abruptly awakened by one OA producer slash bitch, E-Rock. 
[02:36:30]  Bitch.  Fair enough.  E-Rock, she's calling you a bitch.  What do you have to say about that?  He's more surprised he was referred to as a producer.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  E-Rock, girl, her fatty.  There you go.  Is she fat?  Yeah.  Is this a love quarrel between you and her?  Sounds like it.  I'm looking at your eyes.  You guys, just talk about who cares.  No, I have no...  It's all right.  Maybe it happened before.  Let it out.  Let it out.  Let it out.  Talk about it.  Let it out.  No.  She talks to me to get to him.  That's what it is. 
[02:37:00]  Why are you calling her fat?  Is she fat?  Did you tell her that you like her more if she lost a few?  No.  I don't like her.  All right.  E-Rock, what did you send me, by the way?  It's a text overlay for PalTalk.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  We'll have to set that up during break.  All right.  I just had no idea what it was.  I just downloaded it.  8 a.m.  Back to the log.  8 a.m.  Again, awakened by E-Rock under the premise that Opie wants to chat.  They want to talk.  I want to sleep.  Go figure.  8 something a.m.  Full-on frontal attack from Opie, who is just plain pissy because I called him a dick in 
[02:37:30]  a publication he claims not to read yet.  That wasn't anything.  That had nothing to do.  Do you think anybody would be pissed that she called anyone a dick?  It claims not to read yet, has been stewing about for three days and felt the need to  rant and rave about on my private unlisted number, which of course he doesn't have.  LOL.  This fucking psycho blood thinks I actually have her phone number.  He thinks you have her number.  Are you insane?  Then why are you having conversations with E-Rock every night?  You should be having him with Opie.  Why don't you just call it?  Call you. 
[02:38:00]  Well, E-Rock is probably the go-between.  What happened is E-Rock's falling in love with her.  No, E-Rock is not falling in love with her.  Falling in love with her.  Exactly.  You put G's wherever you want.  He's not falling in love with her.  Falling in love with her.  You can't say a G word without the next word.  Not being a G.  Will you panic?  Hey, give him a break.  He's a little nervous because he knows his fiancee's listening.  He was pretty like adamant about it.  He's like, I'm not falling in love with her.  It's going to sound convincing, too.  Imagine if he was outside and he had to get to here. 
[02:38:30]  I'm sawing wood.  Failing miserably.  All right.  So I think he's developing some feelings for that.  So what?  It happens, dude.  You're human.  You're loyal to your girl.  You're just kind of loving someone right now.  So I-O-B was ranting and raving about her.  What color is your girlfriend's hair?  Okay.  Back to you.  What color is it?  Red.  What color is Darian Atul's hair?  Red.  All right.  Just trying to figure things out.  A lot of guys go for the same type of woman. 
[02:39:00]  Are you a chubby chaser?  No.  You like the big girl's name?  And Angela insists on not gaining weight, so you have to go back to Darian?  He's a chubby chaser like a dog chases his tail.  You're never going to catch your belly.  It's all an illusion.  So Eric, I'll just hit a little bit of an emotional point here for you with this.  Darian, what's going on?  By the way, no emotional point to it.  I got some more stuff I want to give to the jury. 
[02:39:30]  E-Rock is one of Darian's top friends on MySpace.  Top friends?  What's that about?  No idea.  She also photoshopped her face over your head in the press photo.  Sounds funny, at least.  She's good.  I like it.  That's why you like her.  She makes you laugh.  That's funny stuff.  We already have a broad on this show, and his name is Jim Norton.  That's right.  We don't need another broad.  I don't even know what that means.  I just figured it might be a fodder for something.  You have a thing for this girl.  No, I don't have a thing. 
[02:40:00]  Well, I don't want to let Eric off the hook.  Because I think Eric's heart now is getting involved with her.  He felt good he was in her top eight.  I wouldn't let Eric off the hook either.  You know what?  He'll bring it market.  Did you ever fall asleep at night and look at your girl and go,  good night, Darian?  Did you ever say that?  Never.  So what's going on with you and Darian?  Not a thing.  What kind of fucker?  That's all we need to know.  There's nothing.  Nothing.  Is she a good kisser?  I've never kissed her.  Fiery red bush?  Fiery red bush?  I've never seen her.  How does her quat smell? 
[02:40:30]  Is it like...  Lucky charms?  Fresh, clean, like Irish spring?  She ever put her asshole on your cheek and leave a mushroom print?  Mushroom print?  Ah, wow.  Back to the log.  Yeah.  So I was ranting and raving about her, or to her,  on her private unlisted number,  which, of course, she says,  I don't have, and then writes, LOL.  LOL. 
[02:41:00]  What do I...  What do you want...  What do you need me to swear on today?  Erock's heart.  Which is being broken by Darian.  Yes.  That's right.  This broad...  Erock.  I'm eating my grapefruit.  Does she really think I have her number?  That I'm not sure of.  Well, apparently from the little thing you're reading.  Yeah, she's absolutely fine.  This is just what she wrote, but what is she telling you?  Well, he's our inside source.  Yeah, you're the inside source. 
[02:41:30]  Please, we all know that.  You're deep throat.  What kind of...  You're having some of that pillow talk.  The pillow talk.  What is...  I was just going to say that, too.  What does the pillow talk say?  What's the matter, honey?  Jimmy really railed me on the air today.  I just...  I don't know.  Yeah, and she talks to you about what she'd do if she was there.  What does she say when you're...  How she'd cut me little bunny balls.  When you're spooning.  When you're tit-fucking her.  You are face-to-face.  Is there anything going on?  No, his idea of spooning.  She's in bed waiting, and he's eating a Ben and Jerry's. 
[02:42:00]  So, listen.  So, listen.  He's knife and forking with a steak.  When you need her, what do you guys talk about?  Yeah.  Like, for real.  I mean, no big deal.  What are you talking about?  When I what?  When you need her.  Like, emotionally.  I don't need her.  I don't want her.  I want nothing to do with her.  When you guys meet, you know, on the side there.  Clandestinely.  Yeah.  Is it all you can do not to use the private number? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  I won't call today.  I won't call today.  Do you have her listed under a fake name in your phone?  So, when you text each other, your girlfriend doesn't notice unless she reads the text and  wonders why Bill Peters is saying, I miss and love you.  Bill Peters.  Or Donnie O'Toole.  Stupid probably put Peter O'Toole, forgetting his name is.  So, now he's going to explain why he has Hollywood friends falling in love with him.  He played to Caesar in Caligula.  Peter O'Toole is calling E-Rog. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Back to the log.  Open the letter to Opie continues with, uh, Anthony never met him.  Don't know him.  Don't pretend to, but he looks and sounds like a mechanic from the Bronx.  Okay.  Go fuck yourself, you red-headed cunt.  Ugh.  Go shove.  Go shit in your hat.  Go shit in your fucking untalented, fired ass, never have a gig again hat.  Go shit in your hat.  I didn't bust your transmission.  Next time you fucking E-Rog, I hope he shits on you. 
[02:43:30]  That's right.  And then in your hat.  No offense, E-Rog.  That is not happening.  I know.  How many times have you fucked her?  You would never shit on her.  Never.  Once.  Never.  How many times has she sucked your dick and groped your balls?  Never.  Never?  Or just cupped them.  I bet you he's-  And she's got to insult me?  Let's take a-  Not that I'm insulted, you know, if you're a mechanic in the Bronx, you know, go fuck yourself.  Sorry about that.  If you're insulted.  Would you take a lie detector test?  Sure.  Mm-hmm.  Interesting.  Okay.  A little too anxious to take that on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know. 
[02:44:00]  You put the tack in your shoe and step on it every time they ask you a question.  Is that how they do it?  Yeah, that's how you're supposed to defeat it.  Drink a lot of cough syrup.  Yeah.  Because the pain affects your body and it gives a false reading.  Well, how about-  So who do you think you are?  George Lutz?  Like you're just going to take a lie detector test and pass it?  I'm talking about my ass over here.  They were goats.  They were goats.  Hey, we got a very good question coming in from Turtle from Whackbag.  Turtle.  Does that work?  Hey, E-Rod, does Darian titty fuck you?  Yeah, before she pegs you, some of that pegging, does she titty fuck you? 
[02:44:30]  Comment?  Never had a relationship.  All right, back to the log then.  Open letter to Opie.  Never met me, never fucking know me.  Well, that pisses me off too because she's like, Anthony never met him, don't know him.  But she said she did before.  All right.  Didn't she?  We never talked to this bitch.  I never fucking talked to her.  I think it was on the air, a little bit illegal on XM, and I know for sure I was called a  cunt and twat. 
[02:45:00]  No one's arguing, but give a girl-  Because I am.  Yeah, no one's arguing, but give a girl a little notice.  Give a girl, come on, this couldn't be the first time, honey.  Yeah, really?  Uh, jeez.  J-E-E-Z?  Z.  Want to pull my pigtails at recess, Opie?  Don't try to sound young, you fucking hag.  Love, L-U-V.  Mm, boy.  Uh, the so irrelevant that you devote an hour to me, dumbass. 
[02:45:30]  Can I point out something that she says-  She calls herself D-Dawg.  She's equating-  We got any comments?  That's for Devil Dog.  She's equating calling her a cunt with playfully pulling her pigtails.  Yeah.  There's a difference.  If he's just giving you little jibes, that's one thing.  But when someone's dropping a C-bomb on you, that goes a little beyond yanking your pigtails  at recess.  Exactly.  That's taking a shit in your milk at nap time.  For making you drink it like it's fucking Cocoa Puffs. 
[02:46:00]  All right, so she's going to come in tomorrow?  If you want her to.  I told her no, but if you want her in.  Because of course, you can't stand to see her in public.  You're afraid your feelings will show.  You're scared, aren't you?  Yep.  No.  She might say something.  You're afraid she'll say something.  What's she going to say?  She's going to talk about the mold that you have on your ball bag.  That only she would know.  That's true.  Do you have her number in your phone?  Yes.  Under her name? 
[02:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Why?  Would you like to see the logs, please?  Why?  Because I have everybody's phone number in this phone.  Really?  In the world?  Which begs the question.  In the world.  In the world.  Okay.  Everybody's?  All right.  Mm-hmm.  I don't have her name.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  How did you get her number?  Yeah.  Good question, Jimmy.  And how long have you had it?  Oh, God damn it, Jimmy.  Probably.  Probably?  How about how long have you had it?  No, no.  The thing is, she keeps switching her phone number.  How would you know that? 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  But you stay on top of it.  You have it every time.  Yeah, how do you know this?  That's good.  Dude, she's done with you.  The fucking was good, but she's, you know, she's done.  So how do you keep having her number?  What's going on?  She keeps calling from different numbers, or block numbers now, so that you don't know  it's her.  Well, then a block number, it doesn't even pop up on your phone.  No, it'll say private call or unknown.  So you have to answer the call and then say, hey, by the way, can I have your number?  What's your new number?  Because it didn't come up. 
[02:47:30]  She doesn't give it to the last people.  So how do you get your number?  I only have the last number that she had called me from.  How long have you had her number?  About a year or so.  Holy shit.  Wow, it's been going on that long?  A year.  It's been going on.  Does that number still work?  She's called myself and two other people from here for the last two years.  Wait, who else?  Two other people.  Steve.  One isn't here anymore, and the other one's right behind me.  Steve, so how many times have you stroked your cock on the phone with her?  Never.  Seriously?  Never.  You never put her on speaker, grab a towel? 
[02:48:00]  Nope.  You never just ask her leading questions while you're quietly jerking off?  No.  Oh my God.  What day's good for you?  Steve, what do you got on this Darren O'Toole?  How long has her and E-Rock had a thing?  You know what?  Until last week or whenever we had this little thing with her, I didn't even know Eric was  talking to her.  She would call me.  Oh, why wouldn't you tell Steve?  Why wouldn't you tell me to produce you?  Why do you keep it under your hat?  Because you weren't protect her.  Oh, really?  Because you didn't know for the last year or so.  Every time she called and said something about you, I didn't tell you. 
[02:48:30]  So why is it a secret?  Why would you keep it a secret?  Why do you keep it all this secret?  I was amazed that you had any type of relationship with Darren O'Toole, because whenever her name  would come up, you never brought it up.  That's not true.  So why wouldn't you tell your friend Opie that someone's bad-mouthed him so we can attack  her on the air and straighten it out?  I did.  Every time she's called to talk about him, I've told him what she said.  Every single time.  Really?  Yes.  I swear to God, I don't remember.  I've sent you emails.  I've talked to you in person about it. 
[02:49:00]  You don't really listen to you.  We got the San Francisco audio a couple years ago.  I said...  I believe.  I don't remember.  I don't know if I believe Opie.  I'm not sure.  He's relying on the fact that you'll say that because he knows that you're busy with other  things in your life.  I'm busy.  Yeah.  I'm busy.  So, uh, I don't know.  All right.  So you've been talking to her for two years on and off.  And she keeps changing her number, but she always gives you the new one to make sure  that you have it.  Is that true?  Of course it's true.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at him.  Anytime she called, I kept the number because it was from a different number. 
[02:49:30]  Why would you keep it?  Well, let's see.  When we did the thing with her article, we had the number so we could get her on the phone.  That doesn't explain why there's been two years of back and forth.  What says we had the number shit?  It's you.  You had the number.  I had the number so we could get her on the phone.  And you guarded protectively because you're afraid.  You're afraid of people moving in on your territory.  Ew.  No.  You're afraid of the info that she has.  Something happened.  We have ways of making you talk.  Here's whatever it is.  At some point.  Now you're making a story out of nothing.  Something happened.  Whatever it is.  I don't know what it is. 
[02:50:00]  Nope.  Here's what it is.  Eric has a fetish.  His girl knows his fetish because they've been together for a while.  She probably is disgusted by it, but she does it because she loves him.  Okay.  Darian also knows it.  So Eric knows that if Darian gets on the air, she can say, well, Iraq likes this and his  girl will listen and go, oh my God.  And it's confirmed.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's never even been joked about on the air.  Like something like, like when you're kissing, the only way you can come is to have your dick  pulled hard and your titty twisted and pinched.  Like it's something weird like that.  I was the only one that did that with my thumb.  Um, but it's something specific like that. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Like when I fuck, right?  My girlfriend, this is true.  It helps me to come to have my nipples brushed gently.  It's almost wax on, wax off, but my girlfriend has to put her hands up almost like she's  going, no, no.  Or she's waving at people on a plane flying above her.  She has to gently brush my nipples.  She's actually saying, stop, stop.  Not in the eye.  Just to brush him like that.  Gently.  Can I ask, and I know, because we've talked about this on the show and you're not the  only one.  I don't, I don't get that one.  What?  I wish I didn't either. 
[02:51:00]  I don't get it.  I didn't need it until I was in my mid-twenties.  No.  I don't, I don't want, I don't want, I don't want none of that.  You know what, I don't need it.  It's like, it's like a pickle with a sandwich.  It's nice to know it's there, but that's a nice side thing.  No, this is Jimmy.  I don't need that.  I wish I did that.  It's Jimmy's thing.  Like, he'll do this when he's like, like taking care of himself and stuff.  I'll tell you why.  He'll look at girls in the studio or something or a story on the phone.  Like, where does that come from?  And he'll be like, oh, I'm filling up.  And then he'll just be tweaking his nipples. 
[02:51:30]  I'll tell you why.  It's because I've abused my dick.  Right.  So I've lost a bit of sensitivity.  If I leave it alone, it's good.  But I've always, I can cum while my dick is soft.  I've abused my dick so badly, I don't even know when I'm horny anymore.  Like this, I'm like a chimp.  There's times where, when times get tough, you know, the tough go shopping.  That's me.  I jerk off.  I pick up a banana with each foot and I just jack off.  Your dick's got to look like a hammer toe.  It's fucking, it's horrendous.  So what happens is like, in order to, the stimulation is the nipple, this is a new erogenous zone. 
[02:52:00]  I discovered my 20s.  I never liked my nipples.  It's just, look, I'll do mine right now.  It's just uncomfortable.  And it's like a shooting pain.  It makes me tickle.  There's times where I don't like it either.  I'm like, stop.  But you say you like it lightly, right?  Yeah, who doesn't?  All right, let me try.  You gotta make that sound in your head.  You gotta make the noises as I do it.  Jesus.  What am I, fucking a leprechaun?  That's the sound I make.  Fuck, I'm nipping out, though.  What the fuck is that about?  I'm up to.  Don't look at me. 
[02:52:30]  Don't look at me.  I'm nipping now.  I need a band-aid to cover this up.  What the fuck, Jimmy?  Here's what you do.  Take your two middle fingers, like they're two bug antennae.  All right.  And just take it and just gently brush the nail over it and go, he-ly-ly-ly-ly-ly.  It feels terrific.  Now picture a mouth on your cock.  And who's not happy?  You should get your nipples sucked.  Have a girl fucking you in the lead over and gently suck your nipples?  Holy mackerel.  That's, um, no.  Okay.  You know, it's odd.  It's almost a feminine thing to have done to you. 
[02:53:00]  No.  I like my ass licked, too.  Get in there, girls.  Get lapping.  Well.  You know what?  I'll tell you what.  Hold on.  I want to go first.  Go ahead.  I know what my ass is capable of.  Fuck no, man.  Really?  Capable of.  I know what my ass is capable of.  I would never.  What is your, what?  Can you read?  What is your ass capable of?  That is, wow.  I will put a girl on her back, and I will put my ass out her mouth, and I will grab her 
[02:53:30]  face and hold it and say, lick.  Wow.  On Valentine's Day.  Yes, exactly.  With a red bow tied around my ball bag.  And a fucking, I eat food dye, so if I shit in her mouth, it's red.  No, I, my, uh.  Merry Christmas.  Wow.  My girlfriend's on an ass eater, unfortunately, which bugs me.  She's done it a couple times, but that's not her thing.  That's force.  That's like forcible.  When, when, if she's not into it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want it if she doesn't want it.  I would, uh, I, I would dig in anywhere, but, um, but as far as having that done with 
[02:54:00]  me, it just, first of all, I don't need it.  Secondly, I don't want to subject any, any girl to it that wouldn't want to do it.  Clean.  Clean.  I think answer with me.  A girl, for, for, for me, a girl is from head to toe completely, uh, ravageable, uh,  in any way, shape, or form.  Yeah.  But me, ah, just leave that whole area alone.  I'll get on my hands and knees.  This is one of the positions I've been in with massage therapists. 
[02:54:30]  I'm on my hands and knees.  Wait, can you do it on the counter?  Uh, yeah, sure.  All right.  Oh, clear it off.  Oh, God, okay.  We got a live audience today.  I figured we'd give them a treat.  Do we have any massage music?  Uh, I'm on my hands and knees now.  You're on, wait, don't move, kid.  You're not going to get to be like this again.  What's wrong with you?  I'm on my hands and knees like this.  Hero, Mr. Jimmy.  And I'll be, no, I'm propping myself up with my elbows right now.  It's almost, you're almost doing a plank.  I take each hand and I cross them under and I tweak my nipples like this. 
[02:55:00]  With my fucking ass being eaten.  For the people at home, Jimmy's ass is way up in the air right now.  My ass is up in the air.  I am on my fucking...  Oh, conveniently, Steve just walked in.  Of course he does.  I know.  I know.  Well, it's a wonderful view in here today.  What you do is I'm propping myself up with my elbows so my hands are free to do some nipple  tweaking.  So you're tweaking...  And she's working it?  Oh, yeah.  But I had a massage therapist put me in this position one time and she took my dick and 
[02:55:30]  yanked it between...  Not hard, but she pulled my dick back between my legs.  Hey, hey.  It didn't hurt.  And she was licking and spitting on my cock and lapping my asshole.  And I fucking...  I understood what it was like to see the Beatles for the first time.  Oh, my God.  This was a...  What?  This was a shidatsu massage?  No, no.  This was a wikers.  Oh, my gosh.  She was amazing.  Very sexy.  Oh, fuck.  Can we take a break? 
[02:56:00]  That was very...  Yeah, everyone's got rods.  I need a shower.  Everyone's got rods.  Black dicks out, fellas.  Hey, can I talk about...  Oh, man, Jimmy.  I got something.  I don't know.  I got a...  You fucking fearless.  I love you.  What?  After the break, I got something.  I got a hole in it.  But I attempted to read Clockwork Orange.  It's a tough read.  Can we get into it after the break?  Yes.  I was so fucking pissed.  I love reading.  People probably don't know that about me.  I like to read a lot of fucking books.  Yes.  And Clockwork Orange. 
[02:56:30]  I haven't seen the movie in, like, we...  I don't know.  15 years, maybe?  And I decided, you know what?  I don't really remember much of the movie at this point, except for some of the lines.  And I want to read the fucking book.  Sure.  I'll get into it next.  But I was so fucking disappointed.  You can't read this book.  You are bulls.  Great bounce of your blockos to you.  Right.  See you only now.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  On the next Opie and Anthony show, Opie and Anthony face their toughest challenge yet.  Hey, this is Jim Norton. 
[02:57:00]  Listen as one man describes an addiction.  Wherever there were cocks, there was me.  And how he went from one cock to many.  I was taking a hundred a night.  What do you think of them apples?  Then, you'll hear a horrifying tale of a bukkake party gone wrong.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  All over my fat, colorless stomach.  You can't tell where the cum ends and my skin begins.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  Plus, an ending you won't want to miss.  That's right.  I say a couple of men do some docking and settle this.  It all happens on the next Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:57:30]  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  What's all that banging?  Oh, you're opening up sex toys?  Ah.  Steve's opening up a box of sex toys from...  Do we have movies with these girls in it that are here?  Yeah, right here.  They're fucking smoking, man. 
[02:58:00]  What's the big plug today?  AdamEve.com or Adam and...  What is it?  AdamEve.com slash wow.  AdamEve.com slash wow.  Special deals.  Special deals.  50% off on almost everything, I think.  Caden Cross and Brie Olson are both...  They're getting ready to get in here and christen the studio.  Fucking sexy, man.  Hey, just because I started before the break, no real big deal.  So I tried to read Clockwork Orange.  Yes.  And I got through the first chapter, which took me over a half hour. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  Should have taken five minutes to seven minutes, maybe ten.  And by the end of the first chapter, my brain officially exploded and I actually threw the book.  Well, what happens is...  And I'm so bummed because I want to read that book.  It's a very tough read.  You should see the movie again first.  Read it.  Is there a glossary?  Someone's telling me who gets credit.  Jim A. in Jersey says there's a paperback edition that has a glossary.  Oh, yeah.  You don't have the glossary? 
[02:59:00]  You have to have the glossary.  It was a book...  There's a glossary and a 21st chapter.  The glossary...  For a bibliography?  Yes, there is.  I want a bibliography.  Are there footnotes?  Ibid.  Ibid.  No, on the back.  It's called...  I want to say it's Raz something.  It's a really weird dialect.  He kind of took from Russian and created this interesting dialect.  Are they called Nad...  Nasdaq or some shit.  Nad-sat.  Nad-sat.  Okay, whatever.  Nad-sat words?  Nad-sat.  Yeah, something like that.  Jim A. is helping me out with that. 
[02:59:30]  And there's a...  Thank you.  You're on your...  You have your fingers in the back in the glossary.  And you start looking at what the words mean.  It also helps you with the movie, though.  Oh, so...  It's absolutely words.  Anytime he says you have your fingers in your back,  I don't think glossary is going to be the next word.  No, but you have to.  With this book, you have to have a glossary.  Without a glossary, you're going to be lost.  So you should get it in paperback with the glossary.  It's worth it.  I was so fucking pissed, man.  Because it...  And I think as an author, like, wow.  You know how many people didn't read your fucking book  because you had to be uber cool? 
[03:00:00]  What's it going to be then, eh?  Too cool for the room?  Dude, I think tomorrow...  Is Roland going to be in?  We should have him read the first couple pages.  That's the opening line to the book.  I know.  What's it going to be then, eh?  But we should get Roland to fucking read like a page or two.  And then the listeners' brains will explode, too.  It's a very tough read.  But again, if you have a glossary, it's a lot easier.  I just finished Sully's book.  How was he?  He said it was good.  It was fantastic.  Do you got his email?  I have his number.  Number. 
[03:00:30]  Yes.  I just want to send him an email and say,  Hey, it was great.  Sully?  Although I would have, after that Metallica concert,  I couldn't believe that fucker plays the drums so good.  I would have given him a handjob out of respect.  It's not gay if you're just going,  Dude, good job.  Of course not.  Dude, he wasn't even known as a singer  when he was putting the Godsmack stuff together.  When he started the Godsmack project,  people said,  Well, who's going to sing this stuff?  And it's in his book.  Sully goes,  I want to give it a shot.  And they kind of like,  the people around him that knew him for so long as a drummer,  they started laughing at him.  Like, come on, stop. 
[03:01:00]  Really?  Who are we going to get for this?  Sully's like,  No, I think I could do this.  Wow.  Yeah, so he really wasn't even singing  before the Godsmack project.  And that's the whole sound of that band.  Yeah, I'm sure he did a song here and there,  but in general,  he definitely wasn't known as a singer.  There was a cool musician at the Gene Simmons roast.  I saw him,  and I walked by him a few times,  but I didn't get a picture.  You know Jerry Cantrell?  Of course.  Do you know Jerry Cantrell?  Yeah, but Alice in Chains is one of my favorite bands.  I should have got a picture with him,  but he wasn't at the after thing. 
[03:01:30]  I didn't do any before.  I've gotten less interested.  We've interviewed him many times,  and they're still trying to do an Alice in Chains thing  without Lane Staley.  I have a little problem with that.  He's dead.  It's not like they replaced him.  I mean, if a guy dies,  you've got to move on.  It's tough.  Especially him.  They found a singer.  The guy's voice was like...  Not that good, right?  Yeah.  Lane Staley had one of the...  It's amazing.  Kurt's voice was pretty amazing,  but Lane Staley, I think,  had a better voice,  and I think Scott Weiland probably...  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr. 
[03:02:00]  Let's not forget the great Stephen.  If you listen to Pendulum from the band Foundry,  you will hear a voice...  Unlike any others.  Fantastic.  The reason it's unlike any others.  But they're trying to do Alice in Chains.  They got a black singer  that sounds a lot like Lane Staley.  People are pretty freaked out by the sound.  By the sound that comes out of...  Because Lane Staley had such a special voice.  It was very different.  Certainly did.  But anyway, whatever.  We have these beautiful girls.  Girls.  Beautiful girls.  Kit Kat Club. 
[03:02:30]  Kit Kat Club.  And the one girl is on the cover of Hustler Magazine.  The February...  She was fucking fantastic.  Wow.  Fantastic.  Caden Cross.  Are these girls...  Where's Steve?  Hustler.  I'll wait until they come in.  Hustler is already into 2008, guys.  Yeah, I know.  Winner's over, according to Hustler.  It's hysterical.  The magazines are always that way  where it's like,  it's a July issue  and it's Thanksgiving.  The girls are the future.  That doesn't make sense.  Hustler has the best cartoons, too.  Fucking Playboy.  Shut the fuck up  with those faggot cartoons. 
[03:03:00]  It's a Santa Claus  holding a whiskey bottle.  I should have taken the expressway.  Ah, shut up.  Give me a Hustler cartoon  with racism and rape.  Fucking Hustler  is the best fucking adult magazine ever.  Ever.  You want to read the Connellys?  Sorry, right?  He's cartoon.  Maybe we shouldn't read that one.  Wow.  It's not even that good.  The Condoleezza one  is not even that good.  Find us a good cartoon  in the 2008 February edition  of Hustler.  Jesus Christ.  Now, the unshackled...  This movie. 
[03:03:30]  Sunshine Highway?  Oh, here's one.  Sorry.  Wow.  What a cock on this guy.  Most tasteless cartoon.  It's a guy kneeling.  He's very well built.  And he's kneeling  on the edge of a mattress  holding a girl's legs  and she's upside down  and his cock is probably  as wide as one of his legs  and it's buried in  and there's jism leaking  all over her  and she's hanging upside down  and the top of her head  is blown off.  Is this Marmaduke?  And there's brains.  Oh, sorry.  And there's bloody brains 
[03:04:00]  all over the floor.  Yeah.  And it's like,  shit, I did it again.  So what happened is  he came in it  with his big cock  and he blew the top  of her head off.  Yes, and he blew her head off.  That's a damn good cartoon.  People are so...  That's impossible.  People are so ignorant.  Can I just interrupt  for a second?  Paul from Wilmington, Delaware.  You're just ignorant.  I can't believe you think  Cobain's voice is good.  You suck at noticing talent.  What?  That's true.  Look at the two guys  on the radio with him.  You're right.  Maybe you don't... 
[03:04:30]  Maybe he's not  a Nirvana fan, whatever,  but you've got to acknowledge  that Kurt Cobain  had a pretty damn good voice.  Of course he did.  You're an idiot.  He was very original.  Yep.  Sounding.  Very soulful.  You're an idiot.  Very heartfelt.  All right, anyway.  Guy's a douchebag, I'd say.  The girls are adult stars  Brie Olsen and Caden Cross.  Do we have any movies  with them in Guy Girl?  Because the guy...  I like girl-girl stuff,  but I like regular sex.  Why don't you throw this movie in?  I think they'll...  I don't have a copy.  Here, right here.  Oh, yeah.  Here, use this. 
[03:05:00]  Here.  There's some deep dicking  in that one.  Oh, these are fancy.  Deep dicking.  The girls are here  courtesy of AdamEve.com.  Check out AdamEve.com  slash wow  to get 50% off  almost any adult item.  They're very pretty girls.  Let's bring them in here.  Yeah, go get them, Steve.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  I was listening to a little  Ron and Fez yesterday  and apparently Ronnie  giving the show the business  a little bit  about our content  and bringing in  the lovely young Lily  into this environment 
[03:05:30]  and he said that  she shouldn't come in here anymore  because it's just a bunch  of debauchery and stuff.  Sorry that we like to have  girls that maybe get naked  and do some fun things  as opposed to having  maybe a couple of your  male employees making out  and a certain red-headed  male employee  asking a black employee  if he could give them  a hand job  or a blow job.  There you go.  Sorry.  Maybe our atmosphere  isn't conducive 
[03:06:00]  to your staff.  And let me tell you  something about Lily.  Holy shit.  That's all I'm saying.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You must be the girls.  That just is.  Wow.  That's not even right.  Wow.  You can talk into  that big black man.  What are your names?  Wow.  Which one?  Who are you?  I'm Caden.  Where did they build you?  You cannot possibly  have been born.  What the hell do you do?  That's ridiculous.  How is my imagination  projecting out like? 
[03:06:30]  It's coming.  We're getting you  another microphone, madam.  Madam?  Yes.  Why are you saying  madam?  Because she's a woman.  What the fuck are you  calling them madam for?  They're ladies.  They're girls.  All right.  Both very lovely.  Congratulations on the cover.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, that's pretty nice.  You might want to move  the money down.  Do you get the name Larry?  I have met Larry.  Actually, I've had a few  covers with Hustler.  Oh, okay.  Where's the picture?  Put him on camera. 
[03:07:00]  What are you doing?  Shut up.  We're getting cameras.  Get to it, assholes.  Yeah.  Relax.  Was he nice to you?  He was very nice.  He likes to give head,  Larry Flint.  Yeah, he has to give head.  Did he really?  How did he phrase it?  Can I suck your pussy or...  Did he say...  Did Larry say that?  Did he make you put  the brakes on the chair?  Or did someone come in and...  I was.  He was at his desk.  His desk is like  the size of this.  Sure.  It's huge.  Did you let him?  No.  Come on.  No.  Did he be a good sport?  You know, I was shy.  I was... 
[03:07:30]  It was before  I'd ever done anything with...  You were disgusted by him.  She's not attracted to Larry.  I understand that.  But even if you're not attracted to him,  wouldn't you let Larry Flint do it  just out of respect?  Like, I mean,  he's just Larry.  No.  No?  Me personally,  I would blow Larry.  Seriously.  He wouldn't know.  Good luck to you.  You'd blow Larry Flint?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Out of respect.  Just to say I did.  Would you let him give you a head?  Just to say you did.  Oh, yeah.  I would.  See?  Who are you?  That's Brie.  Oh, Brie Olsen.  Hi, Brie. 
[03:08:00]  Brie in the house.  You do mostly Adam and Eve stuff,  both of you?  Yeah, I'm contract for Adam and Eve,  so just with them.  Very lovely.  So you're the goer of the two,  obviously.  You're the goer.  What are you talking about?  The goer.  Well, she would let Larry Flint  have his brother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other one has morals.  She's old.  It's a joke.  You know, I bet Larry's  really good, though,  with his tongue.  Oh, definitely.  I mean, that's all he's been doing  for how many years?  Yeah, I guess you'd have to learn  how to get pretty proficient  while you're watching 
[03:08:30]  meat ice cream.  With the tongue.  Larry has been steady eating pussy  for probably the last 20 years.  I don't know when he got shot,  but that's all he can do now.  His bachelor party.  No, not his bachelor party,  because when he married Althea,  he could walk.  All right, Tom, look.  You're all fucking tongue-tied  and flustered.  No.  No?  Good.  A little bit.  A little.  Yeah.  Pretty girls come in,  and we just fall apart.  It's all over.  The show falls apart  because we have no common ground  to communicate on.  Yeah.  You know, it's like,  hey, we enjoy the tits you have. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  It's pretty much as common a ground  as we can get to.  Is it okay if I smell your hair?  Hey, did either one  ever hook up with Lex Steele?  Oh, yes.  Wow.  I love Lex.  She's a trooper, this one.  You bang Lex?  Yeah.  I hear he's pretty straight  when he bangs.  He's not into ass-eating  or any of that stuff.  Lex is pretty much  a straight fuck.  Yeah, you know,  and I love it.  I love that straight fucking,  so it was good.  And then he gave me, like,  this dildo,  like a mold of his cock  to go home with.  What are you getting?  I'm like,  what am I going to do  with this, you know? 
[03:09:30]  A parting gift.  Use it as a flagpole  on your lawn.  Right?  Fucking guy.  What fuck?  That's a man who's confident.  Like, I would give you  a mold of my cock  to leave with,  but it would look like a comma  because I would be all  limp and nervous  and intimidated.  Use it to re-cork  your champagne.  In case you fucking  lose the thing  that holds your earring in,  use this.  Wow.  Fucking Lex.  How big's his dick?  Oh, God.  It's really big.  I don't know.  It's about 11 inches.  They measured it  on some show. 
[03:10:00]  How many?  Some show.  11, she's saying.  The View?  Where did they measure that?  I think it was Playboy Channel.  Hey, I assume it would  have to be some places.  Do girls like the big dick?  We were just talking about this.  We got two girls in the studio.  As a matter of fact,  I think it was Caden's  pictorial that got me.  As we're looking at this.  Oh, yeah.  Tommy?  Very pretty,  a very sexy,  Caden Cross and Tommy Gunn  is a very sexy pictorial  at Hustler this month.  And she's banging him.  And I said,  look at this guy's cock. 
[03:10:30]  And it's not even  the biggest dick,  but I'm like,  genetically,  that's what men  have to compete with.  And then the question  was brought up,  well, do chicks really  like the big cocks  or, you know,  average?  What would you prefer?  Giant?  You know, me personally,  I picked Tommy out  for the shoot.  And I've worked with him  a few times.  He's like,  his dick is perfect.  Like, bigger is too much for me.  Perfect.  Go to commercial.  It's perfect.  She picked a guy  with a big dick  and she's going bigger. 
[03:11:00]  Bigger is too big.  Yeah.  What is he, about eight?  You know,  I wouldn't say  he's more than seven.  It's the width.  Like, he's got meat.  It's huge.  I love it.  It doesn't even look  as good in camera.  Hey, I'm looking  at the pictorial.  Is that real splooge  on your face?  Or is that like...  No, that's called  Cetaphil.  It's a face wash.  Oh, see, it's real.  He missed my face.  Oh, damn.  He missed  and that's the guy  you picked.  So Cetaphil...  He's no Oswald.  Yes, he is. 
[03:11:30]  He fucking got  James Kegg  in the face.  That's funny.  Cetaphil...  The Governor Connolly cum.  More importantly,  Cetaphil is fake cum  in the industry  these days, huh?  Yeah.  Is that real  on your chest?  What is it?  It's stuck in my chest.  Like, what is it made out of?  It's soap.  It's cum.  It's just face wash.  It's cum.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Cetaphil is like a face wash, yeah.  Looks like the real thing.  How do you know?  Note to self,  change.  You got something in your shower?  Chicken home.  You got a chicken what?  I have a chicken home. 
[03:12:00]  Cetaphil.  I know Cetaphil.  So how about...  I just wouldn't know the name.  How about you, Bree?  Do you prefer...  She's saying that she's an average guy  or a little bigger than average  is okay with her.  For real, what's your thing?  Average to a little bit  above average.  Like, you wouldn't want  Lex as a boyfriend  to be dealing with that  all the time?  Oh, you know,  I don't think I'd be able  to walk anymore.  Is he brutal when he fucks?  Like, Max Hardcore,  I think, is a man  with little dick complex.  You know Max?  Yeah.  Max has probably got  like five and a half inch dick,  six inch dick max,  and he likes to punish girls  with it.  For sure.  I think it's angry 
[03:12:30]  because he can't...  Max is...  He's the greatest  slash most barbaric.  Like, he's into  like fucking total degradation.  He's like,  yeah, you little fucking  teenage cunt.  He's holding that...  He's really brutal  but I think he's making up  because his dick  is not like a Lex Steel dick.  Yeah, like the gynecologist  tools that he uses  and stuff.  No, a slap happy guy  is really nice.  He's what Max wants to do.  Does he put a speculum  in you?  He does.  He opens you up  with a speculum.  Is he a gentleman  who warms it under the lamp?  That'd be nice. 
[03:13:00]  It'd be cold.  Rubbing it between his hands.  Let me warm this up  for you first.  Have you had that treatment  done to you?  No.  What's like the weirdest thing  you've had in your pussy?  Goodness.  Well, it's in my personal time,  you know,  like when I was younger  before you could get dildos  or whatever at the store,  I'd use whatever  I could get a hold of for sure.  Yeah, whatever's around  the bedroom or the bathroom.  What was the weirdest thing?  Bedpost?  What did he use?  A cousin?  Oh, for sure.  Those bedposts.  Really?  You know, curling irons,  anything, cylinder, 
[03:13:30]  and any form of a cop.  Wow, that's something.  It's good to be a woman.  We're so replaceable.  It's like, I don't know,  do I like you  or is my hairbrush good?  Curling eye,  the brush handle.  I could be replaced  by a thermos.  They fucking use the water.  Do you know you're  fucking worthless as a gender  when they can replace you  with a water spigot?  Then they can come  using a fucking shower head.  We're finished.  If it wasn't for sperm,  they would just have  dogs eat us. 
[03:14:00]  So, yeah,  Max is a guy  who I think,  like you mentioned  Slap Happy.  That's Brandon Iron.  He's a guy,  a little Canadian dude.  We tried him in here.  That's why I was asking.  He's a sweet dude,  but his dick is massive.  So he doesn't need  to really hurt women  because his dick  does the talking,  but Max kind of  has to go that extra.  For sure.  Is that The View?  What is that?  Who's not having sex?  I'm having a little bit  of sexy time there.  Wait,  is that you,  Brie?  Yeah.  No,  she's hardcore  or is she so hardcore?  We're looking at  one of the videos right now.  Is it hard? 
[03:14:30]  I think it's hardcore.  This is an Adam.  Look at this guy.  He's fucking standing there  holding her up.  This guy's amazing.  He's holding her up  by her ass  and eating her pussy  as he's standing.  In a field.  Yeah.  I would prop you  against the wall maybe  if you were on a ladder  and do that.  I want to go  on vacation there.  A beautiful ocean view  in Hawaii.  It is Hawaii, right?  Okay.  Yes.  It's good to be that guy.  You get laid.  You're in Hawaii.  They probably fly out there.  Wow. 
[03:15:00]  I'm getting horny  just watching this.  You get for a DM?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Well,  you might as well  take your clothes off.  Oh,  Jesus.  Oh,  yeah,  I know.  Holy fuck.  The guy's like soft  and his cock  is pretty big.  What actor is this?  That's Evan Stone.  Okay.  Yeah,  take a bitch.  And Evan Stone.  Wow,  you get all the way down there.  You're fucking fantastic.  You would laugh at me.  She could blow me  while I was fully horny  and then just still talk  to her friends on the phone 
[03:15:30]  and never know  she was doing anything.  Oh,  goodness.  And,  uh,  wow.  Yeah,  you,  that's a good one.  You're on the verge of gagging.  Whoa.  That's fucking fantastic.  That's a fucking,  that's like in Ari Vox.  That's a fucking  drool blowjob  like where they hit  the back of the throat  and it's not puke,  it's just a lot of spittle.  That's very sexy.  It's Cetaphil.  No.  That's fantastic.  That's fucking, 
[03:16:00]  uh,  Aurora Snow kind of does that too.  That's really great.  Gotta love those  sloppy blowjobs.  They rule.  There's nothing worse  than a fucking  dry sandpaper mouth.  Fucking nervous lips  blowing you.  It's fucking horrendous.  What did you eat?  Fucking a lot of  bread products  before you showed up?  Wow.  Do you have an extra  salivary gland?  That's so hot.  My goodness.  Oh,  oh boy.  Spin her around.  Oh no,  he's gonna take you.  That's it.  Why is Evan being so rough? 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  That's who I'm competing  with genetically.  He's just standing up  fucking her  while she stands up.  Oh yeah,  it is big.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus,  Evan.  Evan's got a big bag too.  He's hurting you  with his balls.  You're just slapping your ass.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wow,  look at us.  We're on the radio  just watching,  oh no.  Fantastic.  It's two people  really fucking. 
[03:17:00]  That's why I would  never have a threesome  with letting another guy  fuck my girlfriend.  I would just,  how do you compete  with that?  You can't.  That guy's holding  his cock at the base  with his fist  and what's sticking  out of the top  is more than...  It looks like me  if I shave my head.  Was he able  to completely bury  that in you  without any...  Oh,  you know,  I don't remember.  I think it pretty much  goes all the way in.  You don't remember  so he hit your brain.  There was so many cocks  as what happened.  Well,  you know,  I mean,  I do a lot of fucking 
[03:17:30]  so I don't remember  enough to go on.  I guess so.  Yeah.  It would be funny  though.  It's your busy time.  Every time it pushes in  if you just saw the hair  lift a little bit.  A little bump on her head  like a cartoon.  Got hit with a rock.  You think...  No,  you gotta be honest.  A guy like that,  is he fucking on Viagra  or...  I don't know what they do  just as long as  they're giving it to me.  That's all that matters.  He's on plutonium.  My dick would fucking just...  It would shame shrivel  in front of all those people.  He's slamming your...  Yes.  Your, uh... 
[03:18:00]  Oh,  I love it rough.  Yeah?  Is this a sloppy part too?  She's giving him head again.  He's still standing there.  He hasn't even taken  his pants off.  If he had to run  from the cops right now  he'd fall and look silly.  A lot of spit.  I love a spit look.  It's fucking wonderful.  God,  it's like a cock  a spaniel's eye.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  Now she's on her hands  and knees  and Evan is squatting  behind her  and again,  he still has his  fucking socks on.  I love this guy.  His balls are hanging  like a rosin bag. 
[03:18:30]  I love he still has  his stretchy pants on  and he's fucking  got his legs wide open.  He loves those pants.  He certainly does.  He's probably rented them.  He has to bring them back.  If anybody's stealing  those rented tux pants.  All right.  We got sex toys  in front of the ladies here  from AdamEve.com, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  What do we have here?  Let me just turn down  the audio here  for a minute or two.  We'll keep that on  in the background.  We'll go back to that tape.  Pleasure Skin Eve's Pussy 
[03:19:00]  looks very good  for the fucking.  Oh, look at that.  Was that a little mold?  Yes.  These are like  vibrating lips.  For a guy?  No, I think for a girl.  Ooh.  All right.  What else is there?  The guy things  are just silly.  Yeah.  You get done  and then you'd feel  all silly having to  clean it.  Yeah, you gotta pull  your dick out of a Super Bowl.  It's a Super Bowl  with like a blonde hair  painted on it.  I couldn't get one.  I still have dishes  in the sink.  That thing would be a mess.  Just stick it to the wall 
[03:19:30]  and it'd be awful.  Leave it for the maids.  What else you got over there?  Is there a couple of...  What do you have, Kate?  An assortment of dildos  you can strap on.  How come we don't  open the packages  for these two?  Because we have  everything but scissors.  Yeah, what the hell?  Oh, there they go.  Easy opening  for emergency horniness.  Yeah, I got a little  vinyl.  A little strap-on thingy.  You ever strap one on  and give a guy  like Jimmy dick in?  You know what?  They've let me do 
[03:20:00]  like the softcore thing  where it's a joke.  Oh, really?  You gotta work for  Joey Silveira.  He does strap attack.  Strap attack?  He does fucking...  Joey is to me  the best director  in the world.  He knows all the names.  He's the Scorsese of porno,  I guess.  He's fucking amazing.  Well, Joey's a real filth bag.  That's why.  It's the beauty of Silveira.  Filth bag.  What's strap attack  all about, Jimmy?  Oh, please.  It's ladies  with fucking strap-ons.  I think they hit  other girls too  but they fucking  bang guys  and that's not my thing  so I don't necessarily  watch them  but Joey will show me  pictures of the girls  he's doing.  You know,  new strap attack girls. 
[03:20:30]  They're lovely.  Yeah.  Joey's a trooper.  Oh, there she goes now  and get that little  the purplish.  That is a little  small one,  isn't it?  That's the mold  you'd walk out of  if we had to  see them together.  Hang on your Christmas tree,  show your friends.  That's great.  She's like,  it's kind of dinky.  No, it's perfect for Kate  and I don't know  what she's talking about.  Her pussy's so tight.  I just banged  this bitch a few days ago.  Really?  Yeah.  She has to warm me up.  It's so sad.  Really?  What kind of banging? 
[03:21:00]  Aw, isn't that a shame?  She's got a tight pussy.  Wait, poor thing.  Wait, Brie did Kaden  recently?  Brie did Kaden.  It's called Brie and Kaden.  And what was that all about?  A lot of girls pecking.  Brie and Kaden  for Adam and Eve movie.  We did a great scene too.  It was great.  It was so much fun.  It was fun.  I'm in love with Kaden.  What can I say?  Are you guys bisexual?  Jesus.  I suppose you could say that.  I'm Kaden sexual right now. 
[03:21:30]  Do you live in L.A.?  No, Indiana.  Oh my God.  Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Is that where you're from?  It's a hotbed of foreign activity.  That's where I still live, yeah.  Really?  Is that where you're from?  No.  She moved there.  Yeah, right?  You moved there  because you want to work  under the hot lights  and get in showbiz.  That's it.  Wow, what do you just fly in for shoots?  What do you work for like a month  and then go back?  Yeah, two weeks to a month at a time.  And then blah, blah, blah.  Why'd you stay in Indiana?  Not to shoot in Indiana.  You know, I really like Indiana.  L.A. is too much for me.  Too much city.  Too many people.  They're too fake. 
[03:22:00]  I just like Indiana.  Really?  Yeah, I just bought four acres  way out in the country.  Right now I live in the city.  Smart.  The money you make from the films  goes a long way,  a lot farther in Indiana  than I would in Los Angeles.  Oh, for sure, definitely.  Where do you live?  I'm in San Diego.  Okay.  I'm the same thing.  I was born in Sacramento  and I moved to San Diego  because I couldn't live in L.A.  Oh, Mike.  That's all right.  L.A. is way too much city.  Yeah, Sacramento's fucking,  I love it.  We have a lot of fans here.  Awful.  Let's be honest.  I mean, it's the camera.  No, no, no.  It's awful.  I moved out of Sacramento.  It shows you what happens  when you go like an hour  from San Francisco. 
[03:22:30]  It just gets horrible.  Fucking Sacramento.  Oh, it's typical.  It's like Albany,  but it sucks more.  No offense.  I mean, I've been there many times.  No, no, I'm totally agreeing with you.  I drove, I drove.  I drove.  I drove through there once.  Yeah, I didn't stop.  It's just the great fans,  but it's just the depressing city.  I didn't want to stop  for coffee and gas.  No.  I just wanted out of that area.  You gas up in San Francisco  and you fucking stop  and get to Washington State.  There you go.  All right, so what do we got  the girls doing here today?  Christening the studio?  Dan?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Do you smell like plastic,  these things?  I love the smell of new plastic.  You like the smell  of a new strap-on dildo?  I never smelled a new strap-on.  My hands are clean.  Don't worry.  He's over here smelling the Percy.  Yeah, that's a jack-off tool.  What's this for?  It's for jacking off.  For jacking off.  See, you lube it up  and then you shove your dick in there.  I couldn't,  though I keep smelling it  like a new book.  This fucking smells so good.  Feel the inside of there.  It has little tinglers in there.  It's kind of neat.  Oh, it's awful.  It's a little gooey.  It scares me.  It looks like the mouth from,  like, it should be chasing 
[03:23:30]  Sigourney and Weaver  through a spaceship.  What?  It's fucking scary.  It's very scary.  But it doesn't hurt.  It probably feels good  to sink your hog into it.  Shoving your dick  in a sea urchin.  Exactly.  It's kind of...  I want to eat this.  It's like on a fucking rice.  It's like a piece  of an intestine.  Yeah, it's fucking bizarre.  There's nothing sexual, sexy about it.  The outside looks like a pussy.  Look at that.  When you've got it  wrapped around your dick  and you're pumping away  with some lube.  Oh, yeah.  That's a fistful of shame.  If I could get a rod right now, 
[03:24:00]  I would actually put my dick in there.  You'd fuck that?  Why not?  Yeah.  Okay, I'm just saying.  Ladies, can you get...  What if the ladies, you know,  get to it?  I wouldn't be able to get hard  under these circumstances.  I just wouldn't.  Not that they're both fucking fantastic,  but knowing that my girlfriend's family  listens to this radio show...  Oh, damn.  ...and your boyfriend was fucking  a piece of plastic on the radio,  it wouldn't work.  But they're okay with the  ass-in-the-air massage story.  Well, they don't care about that.  It wasn't my girlfriend.  Story's a story.  I was saying how  the first girl that I raped my ass,  I was on my hands and knees  and I was tweaking my own nipples  and she went in there 
[03:24:30]  and it was wonderful.  Oh, very nice.  Thank you.  Girls into the ass-eating?  If the guy, you know,  takes care of himself?  If the guy's hygienic...  My ass is very...  It's hairless.  You'd think it was a girl's ass.  Wait, what?  Well, I'm very submissive,  so, you know,  whatever the guy wants me to do,  I'll do it.  Yeah.  It's cool with me.  What's worse than bad girl?  I mean, I just...  You know, just as long as  it's not, like,  really gross and nasty, you know?  But if a guy takes care of himself,  then, you know, whatever.  You ever see  Two Girls, One Cup? 
[03:25:00]  Two Girls, One Cup.  You ever see the video  Two Girls, One Cup?  That's a weird Brazilian porno.  I'm so confused now.  It's a Brazilian porno,  but it's definitely  in a different style  than American adult films,  I would say.  A lot of people...  I've seen it.  ...have seen it.  Yeah.  Adam's seen it.  I think it's probably  one of the most watched videos.  What's the cup part of it?  The cup part is...  It's about sharing, really.  These two girls are, like, 
[03:25:30]  sharing with each other.  That's the theme.  Yeah.  You look like a fighter pilot  with his oxygen mask on.  Jimmy can't leave that alone.  Darth Vader?  Yeah.  Darth's vagina.  This is, uh...  It's like Dennis Hopper  in Blue Velvet.  Yeah, he's just...  Fucking bitch!  This is so...  Can I keep this?  This fucking rules.  I want to wear it  like a funny hat.  That's all for you, baby.  I love it.  Oh, we got a... 
[03:26:00]  All right.  This is a lot different  than, you know,  your features and stuff.  It's actually not, though.  I mean, it's...  It's in the same genre.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  It's independent.  All right.  Well, give it a roll.  Two girls, one couple.  Two girls, going at it.  See?  Lesbian stuff.  Nice, right?  Oh, this is the movie  you were telling us about.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  What?  What's wrong, ladies?  It's just ice cream.  I'm speechless. 
[03:26:30]  It's Cetaphil.  Yeah.  All right.  This is my favorite part  coming up right here.  Right about...  Boy, she looks like  she's so not enjoying that  that she eats it.  Oh, God.  Oh!  What's wrong, ladies?  Just sharing?  We were watching your film  a minute or two ago.  Now you watch one of ours.  You guys are always sitting here  still because you've seen it before.  Yes.  But you two are handling it...  Listen to me.  These two are just...  They're like...  They're grossed out by it,  but they're not going to freak out.  They're doing a lot better 
[03:27:00]  than I did.  Oh, I stay wrong.  And there you go.  Yay!  At the end,  they share a big piece.  The grand finale.  Everybody smiles.  There it is.  That was two girls, one cup.  Would you do that?  Wow.  Now, is that where  you'd draw the line?  I draw the line way before I ask.  Way before I ask.  Yeah, your reactions  are surprisingly  a lot tamer than  the guys we've had in here  have watched that.  They couldn't even watch it.  Turning away.  One guy who had this  vomiting. 
[03:27:30]  Bob Kelly.  You know Bob Kelly?  Big, fat, stupid comic.  Of course they don't.  Of course not.  That was my point.  Okay.  So, how are you not  sick of watching that?  I guess...  Like, you both...  Do you do anal?  Both of you do anal or no?  I have done anal.  Do you not like it?  It's not that I don't like it.  I've done, like, one video  and I'm trying to space it out.  So...  Yeah.  So you don't have  the ass cave.  Yeah, that's true.  You gotta protect  against the ass cave.  Yeah.  She doesn't want to 
[03:28:00]  shit and whistle  at the same time.  Yeah, that's...  Do you file...  Because they pay extra money  for that.  So, I mean,  a lot of girls  want to do it  just for the money.  Do you do it?  I love it in the butt.  Wow.  How great is she?  So, did you do it in Lex?  Could you do Lex in the ass?  Could you take a guy like Lex?  I could take him  better in the ass  than the pussy, actually.  Holy shit!  Yeah.  I just thought I'd explain it.  And I had told him  when we were doing,  you know,  a pussy,  a fucking pussy scene,  I was like,  I wish you'd stick it in my ass.  He was like,  I wish you had known that.  So, hopefully we can do it  from my website.  Wait, I wish you had known that. 
[03:28:30]  Why did he?  It's all about communication.  Was he done?  Well, I was...  No, I was like to find out,  you know,  you get paid a certain rate  for each thing  and he had already paid  for just a vaginal...  But isn't it like a wedding?  Like, if you want the band  to stay extra,  you just pay them?  Yeah.  On the spot?  Like, right there?  I mean, it was like  almost over.  It was like,  oh, well,  I'll just, you know, but...  Wow, that's cool.  Oh, he was working for him.  He paid you  because you were working for him.  Yeah.  Oh, it's production.  Okay.  But I'd love to do  Lex in the ass  for my website.  That'd be awesome.  Wow.  Wow!  Shit. 
[03:29:00]  I got pictures of Norton  on my website.  But why...  Up the ass?  Where's Bree's line?  Yeah, like,  what is it that you...  Like, what do you say no to?  Do you, like...  Like, what is beyond  what you would do?  Well, I don't do DPs.  I don't do gang bangs  for people that don't know.  Double penetration.  Double penetration, yeah.  Director of photography,  so...  I thought they should  stay clear.  Don't try to fuck me.  Dumb Pollocks.  I don't do dumb Pollocks.  I will not do dumb Pollocks.  So, all right,  no double penetration.  Wow, okay.  Why?  Because it's too painful 
[03:29:30]  or it just creeps you out?  No, I'm just waiting.  Just, you know,  something to hold on to  for a little while.  But I'd love to.  I'm such a freak.  I love everything.  How about...  Oh, so eventually  you do something like that.  Oh, for sure.  It's almost like  somehow you've got to keep  some form of virginity  throughout your career  where then you could be like,  this is my first  double penetration.  Right.  Save it for marriage.  Save it for marriage.  Yeah.  You have your husband  and the best man  or a big tax bill.  That's good.  Four nuts slamming  against your asses.  How about 
[03:30:00]  ass to mouth?  That was kind of  always a little weird to me.  Oh, you know,  my butt's clean.  I do it.  No problem.  But doesn't it...  Even though...  I'm sure it is.  Like, I watch that.  Even though the ass is clean,  it's still  a tough  sell to me  to be able to...  for a girl to do that.  It's just like a rough one.  Not even grossed out by it.  Just doesn't...  Isn't there any...  You know...  Not so much.  No.  It's fine.  She's fine with it.  All right.  Am I trying to discourage her?  Next road trip...  Indiana. 
[03:30:30]  I say we...  I know.  Pack up and go to Indiana.  That's where Jim Gaffigan  and Letterman are from.  I prefer you.  Are they...  Thank you, I guess.  A lot of girls  raised like you  in Indiana?  No.  They're like  kicking their ass  or something.  We do start faster.  Do you?  I know that  than the girls in the city.  Yeah, we don't have  anything to do.  We get in trouble  and fuck  in the cornfields.  What else do we do?  Really?  Yeah.  That's kind of  the fantasy thing.  Stop talking and start sucking. 
[03:31:00]  How old were you  when you started  your sexual...  Oh, goodness.  I was super young.  Am I even allowed  to say it on the radio?  Of course you are.  It's the truth.  I was 12 when I fucked a guy.  How old was he?  He was 20.  Mm-hmm.  So that wasn't really fucking.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  That was more an abuse.  That's what everyone says,  but you know,  I wanted it.  I came on to him  and I mean,  I kept fucking after that  and I loved it.  If you would have said  he was 15,  like, all right,  that's even pushing it,  but 12...  Jimmy, shut up.  What?  You know...  What are you,  a fucking psychiatrist? 
[03:31:30]  Don't be a party pooper.  She was a little  12-year-old whore.  She came on to the guy  and then he fucked her.  12 and 20  is a big difference.  Tell me you.  That's fucking...  Is that you?  Were you developed  a little earlier  than other girls?  I had C's.  So you had C-breast.  Did you have some hair  and stuff?  Of course.  So she had hair  and C-tits.  I looked very similar.  I was the same height  that I am now,  almost the same body build.  Did he know how old you were? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  How'd you know him?  He lived across the street.  He saw you growing up  the whole time.  He was Jehovah Witness.  Really?  Yeah.  That explains everything.  Yeah, that certainly does.  Let me look in here  for the Lord.  Were your parents...  What about the parents?  Were they aware of this?  Well, the parents sent her out.  They were like,  look, we'd rather have you  fuck them than talk to them.  Of course, my parents  were not aware  that I was fucking  at 12 years old.  How many times  did you bang this guy?  Three or four times.  And then, okay. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  There was no sexual activity  before that with anybody?  With girls.  I started having sex  with girls when I was nine.  Oh, really?  Cherry popped by a girl,  first kissed by a girl,  everything.  Wow.  My first was with a girl.  Oh, your little friends  I guess.  Yeah, and you know,  it's so fun  because my parents  had no idea  we could take showers together.  My parents wouldn't  think anything about it.  They just thought  it was the cutest thing.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you're  licking each other's  little fucking...  Sure.  Jesus Christ.  How about you, Kate?  How old were you?  I was 15.  How old was the guy?  He was 17. 
[03:33:00]  Okay, so you have  like a boyfriend, right?  Yeah.  But I was in the city,  you know,  I had other stuff to do.  I had other stuff to do.  I have cable.  It's not like fucking  12 years old  with a Jehovah's Witness  across the street.  Wow.  Wow, that's something.  Good times.  No Chris Hansen  back then, I guess.  Yeah, 20s are...  I'm not even judging you,  I'm just saying  he was a little fucked up.  Yeah.  If I was 12,  I would have, you know,  let a 20-year-old  service me, of course.  No.  Yeah.  What a guy. 
[03:33:30]  All right.  I have a way  of taking a sexy story  and just ruining it.  I don't mean to.  Here's your toy.  Just play with that  little cyberspace pussy  over there.  I don't want to fuck  this plastic pussy.  I can't stop smelling it.  You just want to smell it  the whole time.  I love the smell  of new plastic.  Sam?  Yeah.  No.  He's offered Sam a smell.  Are they going to  demonstrate their toys?  They have some very,  some cool stuff  from Adam and Eve here.  Oh.  Oh, damn.  We're demonstrating them?  They didn't tell you that?  I don't know.  What did they say  you were doing?  I don't know. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, boy.  Katie, man, over.  No, I want to wear this.  I think you should bend over.  All right.  Yeah, you want to strap it on?  I'll leave it and go in my ass.  I'm going to strap it on  and put it in her ass.  I'm not opposed to  giving anal sex.  You got lube?  There you go.  Let's play Jehovah Witness.  Oh, we have a little packet  of lube.  Let's play Jehovah Witness.  Yeah, go by the couch  or something.  Oh, hold on.  There's vibro.  Oh, that's cleaner.  Look how prepared  Adam and Eve is.  You can't do too much anyway.  Well, they could fuck  each other with strap-ons.  Of course they can.  And of course,  for all you at home, 
[03:34:30]  if you would like to visit  the toys that we're  about to visit right now,  it's adamandeve.com  Adam eave.  Yes.  Adam eave.  There's no and.  No and.  Adam eave.com  slash wow.  I'm so excited.  Do you have panties  on into it?  Yes.  Oh, blue ones.  Oh, sexy.  I would like to see her with it.  Not that I want to be  fucked with a strap-on,  but I would like to see her.  Steve's shaking his head.  Do you want me to demonstrate?  Steve, what's going on?  What's the matter, Steve?  What's the deal, Steve?  Let's see.  I just. 
[03:35:00]  How do I phrase this?  There are certain things  the girls can do.  There are certain things  the girls can't do.  Who did you speak to?  Homosexual Don Wicklin?  Higher.  Higher?  That could be anybody.  The janitor?  Higher.  In fact, it was.  Higher than Don Wicklin.  Yes.  They are more than.  We invite the girls  to get naked.  We invite the girls  to do a whole host  of things,  but any kind of insertion  can't happen.  Fair enough.  Okay.  Any kind of insertion. 
[03:35:30]  You can wear it.  Sure.  Yes.  I think we can still.  What about like a blowjob?  Is that insertion?  Can she blow me?  No.  Of course.  Of course she can.  She can blow a fucking dildo.  Absolutely.  If the day comes  where she can't blow a dildo  on fucking satellite radio,  I'm throwing you out a window.  That's the day.  Yeah.  You're living in America.  Right.  I think blowing the dildo is fine.  The terrorists fucking win  if that happens.  It tastes clean.  It tastes like a brand new.  Oh, yeah.  It is brand new.  All right.  It tastes clean.  You're fucking licking it.  It tastes good. 
[03:36:00]  He's smelling a vagina.  I guess we're not here  to be dressed,  so I'm going to go ahead  and de-clothe.  Yeah.  Just take those pesky clothes off.  Are we going to do something  or just take it off?  Why?  Do you got a ritual or something?  I don't get cheesy music  or anything?  Yeah, I wish.  Where's some cheesy music?  I'm getting a ruling.  You're getting a ruling?  I know it is cold in here.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Could you move the dildo box  over there, please?  There we go.  And lower...  Is this natural breast?  Yes.  Wowee.  Microphone is in the way.  Adams, maybe move that one. 
[03:36:30]  That microphone stand.  Fantastic, both of you.  I don't know.  Wow.  It's blocking the view.  Lovely.  It just got a little bit colder.  Oh, yeah.  You have very pert nipples.  We keep it cold in here.  It's very cold in here.  They're perky.  We turn and make it a little...  I almost said make it a little warmer.  What, so the nipples go down?  How stupid are they?  I really am a fucking dope.  Fruit.  What?  Hey, Don, can you give me a call immediately?  We got one girl that wants to strap on a dildo and fuck the other girl in the ass.  We need a ruling. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  We need a ruling immediately, so you or Elo have to call before we do this anyway.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Well, that's a lovely picture.  That's nice.  Wow.  Steve, so what's...  Ow.  Sorry.  That's...  What lovely girls.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  All right.  Get them over there.  They're just...  Oh.  Over.  Over there?  The couch.  Sure.  Why not?  Go to the couch.  Go to the couch.  Yeah.  Yeah, take whatever you want. 
[03:37:30]  You want to move the couch up?  It's Brie Olsen and Kate and Cross.  We can see you naked?  Huh?  We can see you naked?  No.  Please?  Please.  Only if I can suck your cock.  Whoa!  She's the greatest person I've ever known.  Would you really suck his cock if he...  Okay.  Would you really suck his dick?  Definitely.  Wow.  Let's do it.  Let's do it, she says. 
[03:38:00]  What are you thinking there, Jimmy?  I'm just happy to be involved.  I wouldn't dream of wrecking that.  Letting a poor old girl.  Is this one of those days you want to go home and pull her out of bed and leave her out with  the garment?  What I want to do...  One of my favorite lines ever.  What I want to do, and I don't mean any disrespect to my girlfriend...  Right.  Is I want to handcuff her feet and put a plank on my window and say, no, walk this. 
[03:38:30]  Oh my god.  My girlfriend...  I have to have your photo, so if my girlfriend ever gives me shit about anything I could say...  You could say, I turned down a blowjob.  She would have sucked my penis, and I said no.  That's right.  Just because of...  Until the mics were off.  Yeah.  By the way...  Until the mics were off.  And she'd blow me until my eyes turned red.  That's right.  So I thanked her and loved her.  By the way, it's being pointed out, and it should be said on the air, and we're getting  called out that we look like idiots right now. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, of course we do.  Because Howard, who's our main competition in the satellite world, gets to do whatever  the fuck he wants when it comes to this shit.  Well, that happens.  It has to be pointed out, because it's coming in like, and people hate when I say this,  but like crazy.  Well, we have to...  They're like, what the fuck is this about?  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck is it about?  Say...  Stern, Stern, Stern, Stern...  We'll talk about it.  Stern, Stern, Stern, Stern...  We'll talk about it in very loud, loud words.  Um, after the show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we'll get on the phone with, um, uh, Elo, and find out exactly why. 
[03:39:30]  Will you get Don on the phone?  Certain things are not allowed.  What?  Certain things are allowed.  I think he's on a plane right now.  Yeah.  I just, uh, we'll talk after the show.  That's all.  Right now we got two...  Oh, now the, uh, the dildo is strapped on.  And...  And nothing's gonna happen.  We've noticed...  So enjoy.  We...  We're just gonna look at her with the dildo strapped.  Okay, yeah.  What?  Did we veto the sucking thing? 
[03:40:00]  No, no.  The sucking thing's fine.  Okay.  I don't know.  All right.  Yes.  Yes, you can.  Uh, wait.  What's the rules?  We're allowed...  She's allowed to suck her...  Yeah.  Our tits.  Oh, wow.  Woo!  Sucking tits.  Woo!  Sitting the satellite world on fire.  Woo!  I don't know, right?  Come with us for a ride.  Wow.  I guess...  AJ Poopy Shits would love this.  She's sucking her tits.  She certainly is.  If I can do an impression. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, you guys.  It's some porno music.  I'm so lucky.  They both...  You certainly are.  I'm gonna talk through this vagina.  Right now...  Right now, Brie is, uh, is sucking Caden's breasts, and Caden has a strap on.  Oh.  And Iraq is standing behind, making sure not to touch, of course, holding the microphone  so he can hear.  And he looks like a little boy.  How about, um, would you be able to lose the panties and then do simulated sex? 
[03:41:00]  Like, softcore.  Only if I get to do, like, some cock-sucking here.  I need a crew cocky.  Isn't that amazing?  We can't even find somebody that wants their dick-sucking.  Do you understand how ironic this is?  It is moronic.  That is more ironic.  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  No, I think I understand what happens.  You ever notice when we have more than one girl in here?  At least one of them.  It could be.  Is it... 
[03:41:30]  Is it...  Is it that...  Is it...  Is it that time?  Oh, I get what you're saying.  No, it's not that time.  Oh, good.  Okay.  All right.  Not that it matters to me.  In fact, I'm very fertile right now.  See, it matters to Jimmy.  Nice.  But, um, it doesn't matter to me.  I've never let that bother me.  Are you on the pill or are you natural?  See, that bothers me.  No, no pill for me.  That bothers you?  Yeah, I don't want...  Do you want to have babies?  I don't want to see...  After I suck your cock?  I'd come.  Oh, I like that.  I don't care what it looks like.  I don't care if the bed looks like a mob hit. 
[03:42:00]  Fucking Jack Waltz to be pulled.  Is she off the...  Yeah, exactly.  I want her.  I don't want her aunt from Red Bank.  Wow.  So they're both kneeling on the couch.  We're in a holding...  Freezing.  We're in a hold position.  Exactly.  Fucking fucking erection circling your...  Well, let's go to Philly.  Josh in Philly.  What's up, Josh?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  This is fucking bullshit.  Who do we have to attack?  Who's the first shot that needs to be fired? 
[03:42:30]  No one gets attacked at this point.  It's fine.  Certain...  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, you know, we're going to speak with Elo.  There are just certain things...  Well, they pulled the...  I got to say something else.  They did pull the old switcheroo on us.  They said that these girls come in and do whatever the fuck they want.  We only found out yesterday that all of a sudden there was some...  A bunch of rules.  You guys can do whatever the fuck you want?  We can to a...  Yeah, we can do this to a certain degree.  It's just...  There's certain things they just don't want. 
[03:43:00]  It's not a big deal.  We have to go to XXXM.  That's right.  That's where we're headed.  The problem needs to be done.  We can get dirty here, but we just can't...  You guys rule.  Stinky rule.  Thank you.  It's just...  Yeah, all I can say is be patient.  Yeah.  That's all.  It's one of these be patient things.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hello again, fellas.  Hi.  Hi, girl from Indiana also.  Oh.  I can't hear anything.  This guy's from Indiana and he says hi.  His name's Cody.  You ever fuck him?  Oh, what's up, baby?  I don't know.  We could have fucked. 
[03:43:30]  I'm not sure.  You're with your whole of his witness?  If you haven't yet, I'd love to.  She won't fuck me.  I'm fat and I have no money.  Are you about 40 right now, I guess?  No, 30?  How old would you be?  What city is he calling from?  To us, it's just Indiana.  Yeah.  I'm in San Marino.  It's all state.  He's from someplace that's like farmland.  Anyway, Jim, you turn this girl down.  I have something to tell you.  One word.  Boo.  Boo.  Hey, man.  I got a girlfriend.  I can't. 
[03:44:00]  You know what?  I would go home and throw her in a fucking shark tank.  Shark tank?  Geez.  If I had one, it would have happened before I left this morning.  Because I knew they were coming in.  Let's go to Pat in Boston, Pat.  I can't fuck that up.  Pat.  The boys get insertion.  The boys get insertion.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The boys get insertion.  Yeah, we would love insertion.  That's not a big deal.  We'll go get it.  You guys want to talk about the war or something?  That was a great documentary. 
[03:44:30]  Spoke to Logan and the lawyer when?  Just now?  Just now.  And good news.  Logan did not want to hear from me.  Good news.  Oral sex on a dildo is okay.  And we knew that.  Yeah, what they were doing up until that point with the licking of the breasts is fine.  I asked about dildo and anus. 
[03:45:00]  I love these conversations that I have to have with lawyers, by the way.  Dildo and anus, not good.  No insertion.  No penetration whatsoever.  I asked about cunnilingus.  That was not, that was shut down as well.  How about binocular soccer?  Binocular soccer, surprisingly, was approved.  Weeks ago.  But, yeah.  The lawyers are just, all right.  It's fine.  I would still like to see her, a very sexy girl, put the fake penis in her mouth, 
[03:45:30]  since none of us, myself included, can have our penises sucked.  You want to see the technique?  Of course I do.  All right.  She was drooling doing that.  It was beautiful.  Steve, call up Logan and ask him if one of the girls, I don't know, trips and falls into a cock.  Where are we at with that?  I can't call Logan again, but I can call the lawyer and ask.  You can't call Logan again.  Logan is in a meeting, an important meeting. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And...  What if the girl falls face first into a cock?  What happened?  Can I do that?  What if it hits her eye like that coat hook in the fucking Bronx?  Just so you guys can hear me make these stupid phone calls, I'm going to do it right now.  All right.  Well, can she at least start on the...  God bless you, sweetie.  Thank you.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I just sneezed.  God bless you.  I'm allergic to fucking naked girls that can't do shit.  All right.  Steve's going to be on the phone with the lawyer in a minute or two here. 
[03:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Let's go to camera four.  And there we go.  That's better.  E-Rock's fat ass was in the way of the other one.  Thank you.  Oh, a little jiggling of the titties.  I like that.  Those are all natural, aren't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a corn-fed girl.  That's right.  You know, just one of those natural country girls.  That's good.  Do you shave your private areas?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like what you got to do, right? 
[03:47:00]  All of it or a little?  All of it.  All of it?  What a trooper.  She wants it to look exactly like it did when she first fucked.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm actually embarrassed.  I shaved mine, too, but today I have a couple of days of stubble.  Oh, really?  Oh, my goodness.  You got a Homer Simpson cock?  I do.  It's like Fred Flintstone.  Yeah.  You should just leave it.  Let it be natural.  I think it's nice and manly.  No.  I like the shave.  It's cleaner.  And my pubic hair is creepy.  It's straight like an Asian person's head.  It's fucking...  No one likes straight pubes. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, that is kind of creepy.  It looks like fucking ragweed.  You should part it down the middle like Alfalfa.  Yeah.  Alfalfa Schweitzer.  I gotta gel it.  I have to curl it so it looks like Sean Young.  My fucking...  If you don't, it looks like Pete Rose.  Yeah.  Give it the old Pete Rose cut.  It looks like my dick has Down syndrome.  I fucking...  I have to...  I love a naked broad laughing at a retard joke.  I did the fucking greatest.  That's fantastic.  Both sexy girls.  They both do hardcore porn. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  And they're both more willing than...  I have to tinkle too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet guys like to titty fuck you.  Right?  I guess.  I don't know.  I would assume.  Not more than...  I mean, not like in work.  I'm not talking about work at this point where it's scripted and stuff.  You still have sex for pleasure, right?  Oh, for sure.  Definitely.  I bet, you know, because you have natural breasts like that that are very, very big.  I would assume guys probably want to stick their dick in between them. 
[03:48:30]  Oh.  Silly me.  Making that assumption.  Do you want to?  Huh?  I think that would be okay if we have some titty fucking.  That's not really insertion.  Yeah.  She pretty much will do anything.  I'm on the Jimmy Norton plan.  Actually, me and Jimmy are the ones that are going out.  So, uh, I can't do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I got a little jealous when you talk about that cock sucking.  That's my dick.  Well, let's go to Utah. 
[03:49:00]  Uh, Mario.  Yes.  Yeah, someone's pointing out that we used to have penetration on NAW, which was commercial radio.  Yeah.  Thank you, Josie from Jersey.  Yes, Mario.  Yeah.  I can't believe you guys.  You got every guy out here wondering what the hell.  None of you guys can get a blowjob.  Well, well, yeah.  We're, uh, you know.  What about Pat Duffy?  Are they allowed to blow Pat Duffy? 
[03:49:30]  Kind of taken.  I'm also involved.  Yeah.  All these guys out here wondering what the hell.  How could you give one up?  Well, this was a great segment.  Um.  Well, it really was.  Exactly what I was worried about yesterday when I heard about this, but what are you going  to do?  Hi, Jim.  How was that piss?  Good?  I had to piss, yeah.  Was a little, did you have a little sticky on your leg?  Did you have a little sticky on your leg when you went to start?  What happens is after you, when you pee, like when you've been turned on, you pee, and  then when you go to finally shake, a little bit just kind of trails to your leg because  you realize it's been a little pre-seminal drips.  Oh, it snaps like Indiana Jones' whip. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  It just goes right on your leg.  Yeah.  My fucking dick is like a spider.  I'm trying to shoot a web to my thigh to catch something.  Yeah.  You caught it.  But, yeah, the girls are very sexy.  They're very willing to do things.  Andy S. from Tennessee.  Goodness gracious, of all the dramatic things I've ever seen in my life, they can't put  anything in their box.  And someone is asking, it's a Philly fan, he's asking if they can play Spin the Bottle. 
[03:50:30]  Are we allowed to do Spin the Bottle with two porn stars?  Oh, I like that.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Well, the bottle's got to go on the pussy.  All right.  Of course not.  All the lawyers are falling.  I'd love to play Spin the Bottle with them.  Spin the Bottle?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking nice.  Yeah, be all excited as the bottle's spinning.  I know.  Comes to a stop.  I'd probably, like, fucking have it land on the area just between them.  I'd have to lick the floor like a dog while they laughed at me.  My incompetence.  I love the girls. 
[03:51:00]  That's really very, very nice.  Where can we see them?  Yes.  It's AdamEve.com.  And they both have films out.  And Caden is the cover girl for this month's Hustler.  And Bree, you are doing what?  You get films out.  Where can people see your stuff?  Oh, yeah.  I have tons of films out.  With Adam and Eve, I have Sunshine Highway, which is sitting on your desk over there.  And then I was in the movie Eden as well, the one that we were watching that was shot  in Hawaii. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, that's the guy with the big cock.  Yeah, the guy with the big cock.  That's where you can find him.  And then also BreeElson.com, of course.  Okay.  Do you have a website?  A working website?  Yeah.  A working website.  I have three websites I've attempted.  No, I don't have any that are going to.  Anything like MySpace?  I do have MySpace.  Oh!  MySpace.com slash Caden Cross.  There you go.  Caden with a K, right?  Caden with a K and Cross with a K.  How many friends you got?  Um, I don't know. 
[03:52:00]  Probably hundreds of thousands, I bet.  I don't, I haven't even had a K.  You're so hot.  Could you write me back?  Could you leave a message on my MySpace so people think I'm cool?  Can you leave a message?  Yeah.  Leave a message and then I'll tell my friends.  Or put me in your top eight.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Please put me in your top eight.  10,000 people asking to be in your top eight.  Sorry.  Ladies, nothing against you, but I'm bored.  I'm going home.  So, thanks for coming by.  Adam Eve, thanks for whatever.  Thanks a lot.  Gee.  No, I enjoy looking at beautiful female forms. 
[03:52:30]  You're missing out free blowjobs after the show.  Yeah.  You both look lovely.  Sucks for you.  They're very beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  The problem is, it's like we would love to see you doing stuff.  And you're both willing to do stuff and we're not allowed to.  And that's where he's frustrated.  It's not with you.  At this point.  You both look great.  Let's just say.  That's gay.  But yeah, it's like when you work for companies, companies are like that.  And XM is kind of, you know.  You know what it is, though?  They've got to be that way.  They've been that way.  You know what it is, though? 
[03:53:00]  It's fine.  Let's say my favorite ice cream is vanilla ice cream.  I love it.  But there's some kind of strawberry ice cream there.  I'm still going to eat it.  I like strawberry ice cream.  It's not what I really would love, but it's still really good.  That's exactly what this is.  I want to eat.  Keep going.  Look what you almost said.  Live yourself out of that hole.  Ice cream.  Can I watch one?  Would you be willing to at least perform oral sex on that? 
[03:53:30]  Because Atomy did provide toys.  Oh, the toy.  Yeah, let's see your technique on the strap-on dildo thingy.  Okay.  That'd be great.  Let's see her technique.  She's got to take her gum out.  That's wonderful.  Do you mind if I come over there and narrate?  Do you have a microphone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please mic that.  Okay.  Camera one.  Camera five.  Thank you.  Shit.  I'm going to fuck your mouth a little bit.  They're talking dirty. 
[03:54:00]  Certainly are.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck your fucking mouth.  Fuck.  Like that?  She's gagging.  No, shimmy.  Are you spitting?  I'm getting horny.  Are you spitting on that one?  Oh, yeah.  It's taking the fucking...  It doesn't stick as well.  Yeah.  I know.  It's plastic.  Yeah.  She has very nice teeth, too.  Yeah.  That's really not a sexy thing to say.  I feel like a slave owner, but...  Wow. 
[03:54:30]  Wow.  There you go.  There's some spittle for you.  See?  It's dripping off.  You are...  Jimmy is really enjoying your technique.  She is dripping saliva off of that piece of plastic.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  You are gagging on that.  I fucking love that.  That's wonderful.  Do you want to high five?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, wow. 
[03:55:00]  Jimmy got a handful.  This is very sexy.  When she high-fived me with her hand wet, this would be creepy if I was on an escalator.  And I just grab the fucking...  Wow.  They're wonderful.  Yeah, so she has really got that thing.  That's a nice technique, man.  Sloppy wet.  That is a great technique.  That's fantastic.  And she's got like...  This is what makes me happy to be alive.  She has a piece of like spidule hanging.  Spidule just hanging.  And I really feel like a molester because I'm like unshaven and like my gray beard is coming 
[03:55:30]  and I just feel...  And you're just looking.  I just feel like the lecherous porn guy.  Hello, honey.  Show me how you like to be touched.  But it's really...  I'd love to.  It's really sexy the way she's got that.  She's holding it.  And unfortunately, Adam, you sent us fucking strap-ons that were modeled after Asian porn stars.  Because this fucking thing is like five and a half inches long.  I don't want to look at it.  This is perfect.  Well, it's not quite...  You know what it is?  We were looking at the movie earlier.  And in comparison, yeah.  That thing is a little puny. 
[03:56:00]  Kind of ruins it after you've seen the movie.  Yes.  But normally, that's pretty much an average-sized dick.  Right.  Which is fantastic for us.  But I mean like in adult situations, you want to see a fucking punishing penis.  Can I ask you to do one more thing with that?  Like while you're doing it and you're getting it wet, could I just...  Could you spit on it?  Could we...  Could you just like...  That's very sexy.  That sound of this...  Yeah, if you can.  Yeah.  Just spit on it.  Yeah.  I'm not really a spitting person.  I'm so submissive.  I don't like spitting on things.  I like getting spit on.  Yeah, because some girls do that whole thing. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, she likes being spit on.  Wow.  Wow.  I know what you're thinking right now, Jimmy.  What's that?  I know what you're thinking right now when she said she likes being spit on.  You would like to spread her ass cheeks open, spit on her asshole.  And stick your tongue in there.  Well, there's no need to get all poetic and shit.  You know, Anthony, you're bringing a tear.  Yeah, I don't...  Yeah, spitting in the ass is cool.  Where do you like...  I'm not going to spit on you.  I'm just kidding.  Where do you like...  I'm not going to spit on you. 
[03:57:00]  I don't want to think I'm setting up the fucking hot water.  Where do you like to be spit on?  In my mouth.  In your mouth.  That's very sexy.  Wow, really?  You hold the face a little bit.  You are submissive.  Yeah, it's very...  You know just how I like it.  I like to spit in people's mouths a lot, but it's kind of hard to...  You should talk it over first.  You don't want to improv that in real life.  Not when you're walking down the street, ask someone for directions, and then spit in  their mouth.  Somebody's yawning on the bus.  Sorry about the consistency.  I've had the flu. 
[03:57:30]  Just drank a milkshake.  All right, so you like when somebody spits in your mouth.  Okay, that's very sexy.  They're like on top of me, fucking me, and they're just like, do you want me to spit  in your face, baby?  Or maybe they just don't say anything at all.  They just give you a good slap afterwards.  That's good.  Maybe when you were younger, did...  Because I know people that would wrestle around, and they'd pin your shoulders down  to the ground, and slowly spit, and then right before it comes out, you go, suck it  back up.  No, I think that's so cool, though.  Yeah?  No, not so much. 
[03:58:00]  Any wrestling that turned into something back...  Um, okay.  Yeah.  Maybe that was...  Does it turn you on when somebody reads Watchtower to you?  I just assumed.  The Watchtower.  I like that.  Yeah.  I just assumed that had to maybe be some spitting thing or something that made you so submissive  like that.  I don't know.  You know, just enjoy it.  I am.  Just like it.  Yeah.  Love it.  Were you, uh...  Air pulled, slapped and stuff?  Like, in school, were you a girl with a rep?  You know, not really. 
[03:58:30]  I was really quiet.  I kept everything on the DL that I did, so...  Really?  Mm-hmm.  But guys are fucking blabbermouths, though.  They didn't go around going, eh, dude.  I mean, all the guys...  The 20-year-old, obviously, wasn't it?  I'm not old, so...  Yeah, he wasn't gonna say anything.  He ran for the hills.  Have you seen him since?  You know, he got kicked out of his church, and he was engaged, and lost his fiancée and  stuff.  Wait, for this?  For you?  Yeah.  How did the people find out?  Well, because I told my boyfriend, because I cheated on my... 
[03:59:00]  16-year-old boyfriend with him, and because he...  My 16-year-old boyfriend was a virgin.  He didn't want to fuck yet.  I was ready to get fucking, so...  But I ended up confessing to him that I had did it, so then he went and, you know, told  everyone that it was revenge.  I love the fact that, by the way, she even kept the religious theme, because she's like,  I want to confessing.  I kind of like that.  Yeah.  He's fucking sexy.  Confession.  She's on her knees talking about confession.  Oh, yes.  So the guy lost his engagement.  He gets booted out of the church.  All right, so he paid a fucking huge price.  Did he go to jail? 
[03:59:30]  No.  No?  No arrest?  No.  No nothing with the police.  Jesus.  No one called the cops?  They don't fuck around in Indiana.  Hey, for the little church, buster.  That's it for you.  That's like the punishment Carlos thought he was going to get.  Yeah.  You're out of the church.  I'm sorry.  But he actually got to leave.  Have you ever seen this guy since, or no?  Uh-uh.  No.  Oh, I think I just asked you.  Okay.  I'd love to fuck him again, though.  Would you?  Wow.  If you're out there, come find me.  Why would you want to fuck him again?  He's so hot.  Was he?  Yeah.  Would he move?  I don't know. 
[04:00:00]  I don't know what happened to him.  How old are you now?  You're, I'd put you at probably.  I'm 18 forever.  Yeah.  I'm going to get 22.  Gotcha.  21.  Yeah, I would have put it at like probably 10 years ago, so.  Yeah, I'm at the big 2-1.  He's 30 now.  So you'd want to, you know, hook up and.  So is your boyfriend now jealous that you do what you do?  Like, does he have a problem with you doing adult films?  Uh-uh.  No.  How about yourself, Gade?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Oh, cool.  No boyfriend?  No issues.  Do you, ah.  Have you had some in the past where there was a problem? 
[04:00:30]  Actually, when I went in, I had a boyfriend.  When I went into the, ah!  Ooh.  Ooh, hey.  When I went into the industry, I had a boyfriend.  Yeah.  And he was cool with it.  For like 10 minutes and then.  Well, no, actually.  Well, he saw a fucking Evan Stone.  And then there was a fucking note on the bed and his suitcase was gone.  Like fucking William Holden.  He's in a network.  Sorry.  That's a good reference.  Well, I was under contract with another company, so I only did six movies a year.  Yeah.  I didn't really have an issue.  But what was that?  Did the guy finally have a problem with it or he just left? 
[04:01:00]  Never.  Like, he's still.  Or you just cry to him with the.  You know, if I wanted a relationship, he'd still be there.  Oh, okay.  I gotcha.  Yes, he would.  Can I say right now that she's a beautiful, beautiful girl and she's standing there with  a strap on hanging off and we all have to acknowledge she looks damn cool.  Yeah.  It's not like it's a real dick.  No.  You know, if she was standing there with a real cock, that might be an issue.  Yeah, I know.  Might.  She would have known my name when she walked in.  Little tranny joke.  LOL.  Jimmy wouldn't be able to talk.  He'd have her dick in his mouth.  No, no.  The rules are the same in a relationship. 
[04:01:30]  Okay.  See, you look fantastic with that.  I guess that's for married couples, right?  What?  I don't know.  What the fuck is it?  A toaster oven?  It's a fucking strap on.  Maybe you'll register for that, kid.  That's true.  You should give it to a guy before he gets divorced.  Get used to this.  Yeah, the strap on is...  But I'm saying, like, Adam, you sell strap on, but who are they marketing it to?  Lesbians.  What?  Lesbians.  Okay.  I don't know.  There's two girls on the front of the packaging.  Yeah, two girls.  Here's why they're doing that. 
[04:02:00]  Okay.  This is so a fucking guy can go in and buy it so he can get his shit or  taught a lesson to, but he can still face the person at the fucking checkout company.  At the register, right.  Yeah, it's for my wife.  You know, two broads.  Believe me, if there was a guy biting a pillow, fucking, like, hiding his face from the camera,  that would be a more accurate, you know, cover.  Yeah.  Because, believe me, that sales would be down.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to fucking buy something.  You go to the register, plop that thing down, brag about how you got two girls coming in,  you're going to watch them fuck each other, and meanwhile, you're just puckering up your  asshole, waiting for the pain later. 
[04:02:30]  I don't know.  I had a girlfriend for four years, and we always use strap-ons, so.  Really?  Big users with the strap-ons.  We were always breaking them, though.  We always had to go get new ones.  Wow.  But these ones are pretty sturdy.  Yeah, they're pretty solid.  What, like, they would just pop out of the fucking strap-on thing?  I don't know, they would just break, we were just rough.  Wow.  Certainly must have been.  Well, is that a, is that really like a, it looks like the strap is not leather.  It doesn't look like leather, is it?  It's like pleather.  It's pleather, like it's like, can I feel the side of the strap? 
[04:03:00]  Nothing.  It looks like, if, if, oh, it's a little sturdier than I thought.  If there's like a hard, you know, like a pleather, it's not like a leather tough strap.  Well, whatever, whatever it is, it works.  Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm trying to make fun, this is, this is how fucking frustrating it is that they can't actually  do sexual things.  I'm actually analyzing the material.  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck are you?  It's like the roach, this material would survive nuclear holocaust.  Well, it's like QVC, you're trying to sell this thing.  I know, I should put that on my fucking forehead and just run around making animal noises.  I'd love to at least sit on your lap, baby. 
[04:03:30]  Give you a little hug for a goodbye time.  Oh, that sounds innocent enough, Jimmy.  It certainly does.  But I, that's how it starts.  Oh, God.  Look at that fucking Jimmy.  What?  No, I just mean it's, oh, where's he going?  I feel frustrated.  No, no, no.  No, I just, I, I, I can't, uh.  You can't, you can't deal with the situation.  You just ran away.  You fucking ran away.  Yep.  That's wonderful. 
[04:04:00]  Oh.  Come.  Yeah.  Now, I can't do that because I'm, I'm in a relationship and you, oh.  Wow, she really does have very nice teeth.  I'll say she does.  Look at her.  Oh, goodness.  All right, well, they're very lovely girls.  I feel something.  Does it feel like insects stinging you?  Does it feel like a hornet?  I don't know whether to sit on it or grab the off and spray it.

And I should know of which I speak here on Opie and Anthony.  I didn't feel the passion when you mentioned our name.  I'll do that again.  You must be rich and famous, or somewhere on the end is for the rehab.  Yeah, everybody's going as the Osborne and Dillow into the rehab. 
[04:06:30]  They got a hot tub and a sauna if you are a star.  And if you dip the staff, you get a mini bar.  If you're homophobic and you're hating the gays, check into where Isaiah Washington stays.  At the rehab.  At the rehab.  If you are an alcoholic, pretend to take care of it at the rehab.

[04:07:30]  Robert Downey Jr. said to Nick Nolteh.  Promises in Malibu to play to stay, ma.  Kevin said that Britney baby sits in the buff.  So when you go to rehab, you can see her mom.  Whitney Houston, crack.  Bobby Brown, booze.  Courtney Love, smack.  Kate Moss, hope.  Pete Doherty, everything.  Mel Gibson, true hate.  Billy Joel, he sucks.  Amy Winehouse, ironic. 
[04:08:00]  Ironic.  Lindsay used a big book for a photo op to try and push the numbers on her latest flop.  It's going to get worse before it gets any better.  Here's to Betty Ford.  She was a real trendsetter.  At the rehab. 
[04:08:30]  Oh, at the rehab.  They got big fluffy towels at the rehab.  You can see Tom's eyes more at the rehab.  They got a five-star menu at the rehab.  Say hello to Danny Baldwin at the rehab.  Yeah.  Oh, it's all happening at the rehab.  Let's all get some sushi at the rehab.  Come on, the crown royals.
