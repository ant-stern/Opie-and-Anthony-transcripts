<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts ribbing Jaleel White (Urkel) for his continued association with the character, suggesting it was likely due to financial necessity.  They then plugged an upcoming book signing at Newberry Comics in Natick.  The conversation segued to a radio personality named Doug, who was the target of good-natured (though somewhat crude) ribbing about his female audience.  This led to a protracted, vulgar bit involving the invention of obscene and ludicrous radio station call letters.  The show concluded its segment by promoting an upcoming listener trip to the West Indies, punctuated by tasteless jokes about potential encounters with Haitian boat people.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  When it's like, get out of here, Urkel.  Get your Urkel ass out of here.  Urkel ass, MF Urkel, M Urkel.  He is Urkel.  Right.  Because he goes out, and you see him on interviews now.  Yeah, man, well, I've been doing the character for quite a while.  You know, what up?  You know what I'm saying?  So I've been, you know, doing the Urkel thing, but I also got my rap act together.  And I'm going to be doing some movies now with this ending.  And then the reporter.  Hey, Urkel, do that Urkel thing. 
[00:00:30]  Well, okay, I'll be Urkel.  He doesn't like doing the Urkel thing anymore, but it's like his paycheck.  So he's got to milk it.  But you know all the guys in the community.  It's just like, get Urkel.  You are Urkel ass, Urkel.  And that's pretty much it.  That's pretty damn funny, bro.  Poor guy.  All right, we've got to get the hell out of here.  Yeah, where are we going, Ope?  Well, at 3 o'clock, we'll be at Newberry Comics.  Route 9 and Natick with the rest of the AF gang signing copies of Royal Flush.

We're going to have some Metallica coming up next.  Doug on your radio.  So I'm the guy you guys make fun of that.  Nah, he's on the radio.  I see how it is.  As long as you don't end up on one of those fag stations doing a two for Tuesday, everybody.  It's Doug, and now we got some Mariah Carey coming up.  I've done that.  I've done that.
