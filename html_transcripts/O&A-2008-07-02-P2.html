<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about a news story featuring a wedding between two individuals with Down syndrome.  The hosts and callers responded with numerous crude and offensive jokes targeting the couple and people with Down syndrome, focusing on their physical appearances and perceived intellectual capabilities.  One caller, Mike, vehemently protested the jokes, resulting in further mockery from the hosts.  This led to a lengthy discussion about Bill Burr's recent stand-up performance in Camden, New Jersey, where he insulted the audience, audio clips from both the news story and Burr's performance being played.  The hosts then shifted to Burr's Philadelphia show, describing his 15-minute tirade of insults against a hostile audience, which eventually won them over.  They repeatedly used the term "faggot" during this discussion, comparing Burr's performance to *Scarface*.  The hosts also mentioned Jimmy Schubert, another comedian performing that night who faced a similarly antagonistic crowd, jokingly taking credit for disrupting the audience before Burr's set.  A bootleg recording of Burr's performance was referenced as widely circulating on YouTube.

The show then took an unexpected turn, focusing on birds after Opie made insensitive comments about them.  Tom Chiasano, an African grey parrot owner, called in to express his disapproval.  Chiasano shared details about his parrot's extensive vocabulary and the challenges of owning a talking bird, leading to further humorous anecdotes about the parrot's behavior and interactions with his family.

The broadcast continued with a call from Nicky from New York, who criticized the show for juxtaposing a segment about suicide with a comedic bit featuring a seemingly intellectually disabled guest.  This prompted a heated exchange, with the hosts relentlessly mocking Nicky, particularly after he revealed a cousin had committed suicide.  The conversation became increasingly vulgar and offensive, employing derogatory language.

Finally, Joe Namath called in to promote his new book, engaging in lighthearted banter with the hosts, who continued to make off-color jokes and speculate about Namath's past, including suggesting a possible nude photo spread.  The show concluded with a Geraldo Rivera advertisement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, so Mike in Rochester, he likes when we make fun of the less fortunate, the waterheads.  That seemed to be what he was saying.  He gets a big kick out of when anyone makes fun of the less fortunate.  Well, recently there was a couple with Down syndrome and they got married.  Oh, that's sweet. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, I bet you the parents couldn't give the kid away fast enough.  Here you go.  The father wouldn't even walk down the aisle.  He opened the door, pushed her in, and then left.  Here you go.  Tuck and roll.  She's now your responsibility.  They don't play the Here Comes the Bride music.  It's the Benny Hill music to get it moving quicker.  They mush the cake on it to this face, but it's not on purpose.  That's just the way they eat it.  You know what?  Most weddings, like the photographer takes up half the day.  Not in this case. 
[00:01:00]  One and done.  The bride drools on the cake.  The bride drools on the cake.  They have to dance to Daddy's little disappointment.  All right.  Well, is there some audio?  Yeah, this is for Mike.  I don't know if he's going to like this or hate it, so who knows?  If he told us, we wouldn't know.  I have no idea.  But a couple with Down syndrome, they got married. 
[00:01:30]  What do you guys think about this?  I think it's very sweet.  I think it's a wonderful thing.  Yeah.  Then they could, I don't know, have children and have a family and live like normal people.  Sure.  Maybe one of them will become the president like Bush did.  That could happen.  Sure.  Their kids will be very healthy, I'm sure.  Can you imagine the electric slide at this wedding?  Everyone just banging into each other.  No rhythm whatsoever.  No music, but everybody dances to the chicken song.  The chicken dance. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  Here we go.  The world hasn't seen many marriages like the one that was prepared.  Oh, my God.  What is this from?  They're taking the serious approach.  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  With the piano and everything.  Are you kidding me?  I like it.  What was this?  Daylight?  What show was it?  2020.  Wow.  This DNA.  Which was both of their IQs.  Most times it's like the most overheard phrase at a wedding is congratulations. 
[00:02:30]  You got married.  That's awesome.  Here it's, I like chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk.  The serious approach.  Let's hear the piano music.  The announcer and you got the serious movie music.  Yeah.  The world hasn't seen many marriages like the one that was prepared for Carrie Bergeron  and her fiancee, Sujit Desai.  They would have two weddings, Hindu and Christian. 
[00:03:00]  So the plan went.  And two magical celebrations.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's a girl that is marrying a retarded Indian boy.  A retarded Indian boy.  Wow.  Hindu wedding.  Wow.  I work at a convenience store.  I work at a 640.  No.  No.  Wrong numbers.  No.  7-Eleven.  Those are the reading ages you are.  Get it right, old Slurpee brain.  Their lives are tough enough.  Why give them a tough name to go through life? 
[00:03:30]  He could drink a Slurpee as fast as he wants because he can't get brain freeze.  Exactly.  The inside of his skull is just empty with like a little freezer burn like you'd see inside of a freezer.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That's it.  And two magical celebrations.  But more importantly, they were bringing their family, a community, their religions, and a cause. 
[00:04:00]  Sorry, we've got to keep interrupting this.  Pat from Monaki, I now pronounce you dumb and dumber.  Very good, Pat.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  We have some awful listeners.  Yes, we do.  Talon, the trucker, what's up?  Hey, instead of a limo when they leave for their honeymoon, it's a short bus with shoes.  And every other shoe has a lift on it. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, Ralphie Mae, your chuckle there is funny also.  You guys, good luck.  Keep it up.  Yeah.  You chuckle.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Max.  I hope they get a bunch of mixing bowls so they can have something to cut their hair with.  Everybody gets a box set of Life Goes On.  Hey, it's a wonderful thing.  Come on.  No, it really is.  And to make fun of it like this is horrid. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, because they'll be good parents.  Yeah.  They'll be able to relate to their kid.  Yeah.  The kid will be teaching them.  Diaper changing time.  Kid's three months.  Smarter.  And now we go.  They don't realize the funny papers are not the intelligence part of the newspaper.  They think Marv Badook is an editorial column.  Trying to buy stock in Dondi. 
[00:05:30]  Dopes.  And now we go into the honeymoon suite to see what's going on.  Oh, right.  He's humping a pillow in the corner.  She's eating something out of the miniball without unwrapping it.  Oh, that's horrible.  Unity, their religions, and a cause along with them. 
[00:06:00]  A cause that could have kept them apart.  I had a hole in my heart, jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly hat.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Can you replay that again?  I want to make sure I heard everything correctly.  I think you did.  This is too easy, guys.  A hole in my heart?  Oh, my God.  We pride ourselves.  At first, I thought that was like.  And going clever, and this is just too easy. 
[00:06:30]  It's too easy.  Big tongue.  Play it again.  This show's on autopilot today.  Oh, yeah.  We don't even have to drive.  You can slobber on the bride.  I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may now.  Oh, it just updated.  Mother.  Hold on.  You may now lick the wall.  That's funny.  It would have been better if it didn't update that.  I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may now eat pennies. 
[00:07:00]  With them, a cause that could have kept them apart.  I had a hole in my heart, jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly hat.  And a what?  Jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly head?  Yeah.  A hole in her heart.  A hole in her heart.  What else?  A hole in her heart.  Jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly head.  You bubble-headed booby.  It's like God had a hangover that morning.  A cause that could have kept them apart. 
[00:07:30]  I had a hole in my heart, jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly hat.  It's bent.  As I got older, I also realized that I'm a flow learner.  Carrie Bergeron is 29 years old, a young woman with Down syndrome.  Technically, it means she was born with an extra copy of a chromosome in her genetic makeup  that causes people with Down syndrome to have learning disabilities that can be mild or severe.  Heart defects are common. 
[00:08:00]  There are also physical symptoms, such as an enlarged tongue that can cause words to sound slurred,  and extra folds of skin under the eyes.  Victim of the modern age.  Poor, poor girl.  By the way, they said learning disabilities that can be severe or mild.  Yeah.  I've never seen somebody with Down syndrome sound remotely intelligent ever.  As you trip over your own tongue.  Well, equal to the square.  Let's go to Eric in Oklahoma. 
[00:08:30]  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, man?  How about my big, fat-tongued, retard wedding?  Oh, my.  Punch it out.  That's just not right.  That's not.  Fat Al.  Steve Martin's doing a movie, but it's called Father of the Dope.  Still be way more entertaining than anyone in a movie.  Don't laugh me out of me.  Fat Al.  Yeah, I heard they were getting a his and her football helmet. 
[00:09:00]  I'm close to punching out.  Oh, it's just, it's so cruel.  You know, for the wedding gifts, no one's giving them a toaster because they have bathtubs.  Nothing.  Look, another bouncy ball.  The father would give a toaster and a big, long fork.  Here you go.  Fish around in there when a bagel gets stuck.  Or a toaster and goggles.  Have fun.  Good luck to you.  How big is that Indian guy's turban? 
[00:09:30]  That's what I want to know.  Those big-headed bastards.  How big is that turban?  It's probably a California king bed sheet.  All right, here's the second clip.  Despite being a slow learner, Carrie grew up to speak as an advocate for people with Down  syndrome.  She earned a certificate as a teacher's assistant, and she works as a volunteer aide in this daycare  classroom at the New Discoveries Learning Center in New York.  But in her teens, she knew there was something missing, and so did her mother. 
[00:10:00]  Not a chromosome.  When she was about 15, I really noticed the loneliness.  It was looming big time.  And I just could see when her sisters or her brother went off with friends, there was just  a look in her eyes as if to say, I wish I could do that.  That's not what the look said.  Blank.  There was just a look in her eyes that said, I'm hungry.  Do we have any cookies or pen chips? 
[00:10:30]  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Well, let's move right into a couple with Down syndrome getting married.  We started this about two weeks ago.  We never finished.  I think we've got to play the first two clips over again, right?  This was from 2020 or 60 Minutes or Dateline, one of those type of shows.  I'm so ashamed of myself.  You should be.  They're going to take your Panasonic Plasma TV back for that.  Oh, no.  That's right. 
[00:11:00]  And still weigh less than that kid's head.  All right, Jimmy.  You were working your way out of it.  What are you doing?  You're back in the forest.  You should have known when he got on the plane and it was short and yellow.  Your seat cushion is also a hockey helmet.  In the case of an emergency, your Pete Rose haircut will lower itself from the ceiling.  All right, here we go. 
[00:11:30]  Couple with Down syndrome getting married.  We started this a couple weeks ago.  Let's try to get.  A slide will pop out.  Please don't attempt to eat it.  That's not a slide.  It's the kid's puns. 
[00:12:00]  All right, here we go.  Couple with Down syndrome.  Downs.  Down do be do.  Yeah.  Short yellow plane.  Ah, well, here we go.  They get married.  Here's the first clip.  The world hasn't seen many marriages like the one that was prepared for Carrie Bergeron  and her fiancé, Sujit Desai.  They would have two weddings, Hindu and Christian, so the plan went, and two magical celebrations. 
[00:12:30]  Magical.  But more importantly, they were bringing their families, a community, their religions, and  a cause along with them.  A cause that could have kept them apart.  I had a hole in my heart, jaundice, a big tongue, and a wobbly hat.  As I got older, I also realized that I'm a slow learner.  Carrie Bergeron is 29 years old, a young woman with Down syndrome.  Technically, it means she was born with an extra copy of a chromosome in her genetic makeup, 
[00:13:00]  that causes people with Down syndrome to have learning disabilities that can be mild or severe.  Heart defects are common.  There are also physical symptoms, such as an enlarged tongue that can cause words to sound slurred,  and extra folds of skin under the eyes.  Okay, terrific.  No kidding.  Wow.  It could be loud on planes.  How can you tell which one's the bride and which one's the groom? 
[00:13:30]  I guess by the hairstyle.  I guess that's what I would do.  Same face, different hairdos.  I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may rub jelly on the face of the bride.  The priest has to keep stopping the ceremony to yell at the bride's father. 
[00:14:00]  Will you stop giving her away this fast?  It's not time yet.  He shows up a day away at the church.  Here, here, here, here.  It's the rehearsal.  He thinks he's done.  Here you go, here you go, here you go, here you go.  Come on, come on, come on.  Very proud, very proud, very proud.  God bless.  Carrie volunteers at a learning center.  She was very lonely there.  Despite being a slow learner, Carrie grew up to speak as an advocate for people with Down syndrome. 
[00:14:30]  She earned a certificate as a teacher's assistant,  and she works as a volunteer aide in this daycare classroom at the New Discoveries Learning Center in New York.  But in her teens, she knew there was something missing, and so did her mother.  Not a chromosome.  When she was about 15, I really noticed the loneliness.  It was looming big time.  And I just could see when her sisters or her brother went off with friends.  There was just a look in her eyes as if to say, I wish I could do that. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Very lonely.  That's sad.  But.  Bob Kelly's crying right now.  But then the loneliness ended when some of the neighborhood boys found alcohol and a mattress in the woods.  Are you nuts?  Are you nuts?  Oh, my God.  The local lacrosse team. 
[00:15:30]  More on the loneliness.  I was very lonely because my friends, they don't have any special needs,  and they can do things that I couldn't do, like having a job and sports,  and also hanging out with their girlfriends and girlfriends.  She sounds fine.  She sounds smarter than a lot of the broads I knew back when they were that old.  I was very lonely because I didn't have anyone. 
[00:16:00]  Like she's, she's not just like, you know?  She's talking, what's she talking about, things she can't do?  Just the fact that she's actually articulate in saying what she can't do,  she should be able to do it.  She sounds more articulate than Rich Voss.  Maybe Rich should be checked.  Special need. 
[00:16:30]  She should correct his English.  Sujit, also.  Those are silent L's in tortilla.  We get to hear from the groom now.  Sujit also has Downs Syndrome.  Took him a long time to learn the right words to express himself.  Life changed in unexpected ways when Carrie met this 25-year-old man.  He is Sujit Dasan.  Holy crap.  Oh, boy.  Off someone's cell phone on the instant feedback.  Yeah.  The guy has a Pete Rose cut.  The girl has an Emo Phillips. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Life changed in unexpected ways when Carrie met this 25-year-old man.  He is Sujit Dasan, who also was born with Down Syndrome.  His parents both work as dentists in upstate New York.  It took a long time for Sujit, as a child, to learn the right words to express himself.  But his parents found that music helped stimulate him. 
[00:17:30]  And although he struggled, he learned, and now plays six instruments.  None of them will.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Mike.  Come on, dude.  Stop it.  What happened?  Come on, cuz.  Stop it.  Stop mocking the unfortunate, really.  You know who should mock?  Comedians that suck.  Like the one standing there next to you.  A little troll.  What's the matter about you?  Oh, Danny, I know.  Why is this hitting you on a bad level, sir? 
[00:18:00]  Huh?  Why is this bothering you?  Do you have a waterhead at home?  Why?  Why don't you?  What's bothering you about this?  Let's tell the truth.  First of all, don't mock my family.  Come down here, I'll twist your fucking neck off.  Oh, hey.  Oh, ho, ho.  Why is this bothering you?  Hey, tough guy.  Why is this bothering you?  You guys look like two little trolls.  I'll come down here and read it.  That's right.  Wait a minute.  You at Jim Norton, you pussies.  Why is this bothering you?  Yeah, what's the matter?  Tough guy.  Don't mock me.  Don't say my family. 
[00:18:30]  Come down here, I'll kill you.  Why is this bothering you?  Oh, a death threat.  Cool, I could get a New York State pistol license.  Finally.  Thank you, sir.  I needed a death threat.  Now, listen.  Why is this bothering you?  Mike, we're allowing you to speak, but you've got to say something of relevance.  Why does this bother you?  Why?  Yes!  Because Jimmy Norton's going to be appearing.  Why does this bother you?  Does it bother you because it hits too close to home?  Because that's what happens with comedy.  No, comedy.  This isn't comedy.  Why?  It's comedy to some people out there. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, you know who's not a comic?  Jim Norton.  He sucks.  Why does this bother you?  I'm going to rip his little troll fucking head off.  Yeah, you do that.  Why does this bother you, sweetie?  And he hangs up.  No answer.  He hangs up.  He hangs up.  It bothers me.  Yeah, yeah, wuss.  It hits close to home.  Anything else is okay to make fun of, but if it hits close to where he is emotionally,  stay away.  I bet Mike laughs his ass off at the black jokes.  Yeah, I'm sure he does. 
[00:19:30]  Or the Asian jokes.  Don't make fun of the unfortunate.  Or when we go into the moronic Italian show on Sirius, that whole thing.  I bet, oh, he laughs at that the second we hit on something a little too close to home.  Hey, my family.  You shouldn't have done so much LSD when you were a kid.  Maybe you'd have a kid that could think.  He didn't say it was his family.  He wouldn't say what it is.  Oh, I bet it was.  I know it was.  I know it was.  He's got to look at that disaster every day and know it's his fault. 
[00:20:00]  It's your fault, Mike.  Keep listening.  You listening?  Your fault.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Your fault.  You smoked that joint before you had sex, didn't you?  We were just trying to have some fun.  Joint to it?  I don't know.  We were just trying to have some fun.  I don't feel too good about myself right now.  I'm feeling great about myself.  I have a problem that Dateline or 2020 did this piece.  Of course.  Because it's the modern day freak show. 
[00:20:30]  That's why people are watching two people with Down syndrome get married.  The girl sounds fine.  They're not feeling for anyone on the TV.  Maybe there's a small percent of the people watching, of course.  But most of us would watch this because we're like, oh, my God.  I've never seen anything like this before.  You ever talk to a stripper?  I swear.  And I'm not.  This is no joke.  We've got to take a break.  That girl, the retarded married girl, sounds more intelligent than any, any stripper I've ever talked to. 
[00:21:00]  There you go.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Mike sucks.  Mike brought it all down.  Mike's an ass.  He's a douche calling a radio show complaining.  Complaining.  And they won't admit why he bothers them.  What's the matter?  He didn't think my insults were any, were worse than yours.  He didn't like it.  Why does it bother you?  Don't come down here.  They!  Why not just admit why it bothers you?  He's going to twist your neck off, he said.  Who cares? 
[00:21:30]  Just put me on my knee.  Good luck.  You'd be doing me a favor, stupid.  He doesn't have a neck, idiot.  Exactly.  Good luck finding the chin.  You're going to twist me.  It'll be my arms.  I'll go, wrong area, fella.  We're trolls.  Hey, don't make fun of my appearance.  Ugh.  All right, with that.  I hate everyone, including you, Mike.  Mike's back, but we have to see.  Of course he is.  Is it, Mike?  Why don't you just tell us why it bugs you, Mike?  Mike.  Yo.  Don't hang up. 
[00:22:00]  I think I got disconnected.  Oh, you hung up.  All right, you hung up.  So why does this bother you?  Why?  I'm not going to admit I don't even know why it bothers you.  Why?  My son's not a disaster.  Who are you to call my son a disaster?  We don't know anything about you, Mike.  We're just assuming stuff.  If you're not going to say, I'm going to speculate.  This is what happens when you do the type of radio show we do.  When something hits too close to home, you get very, very offended, but you have no problem  laughing at all the other crazy stuff we do.  I don't laugh at it.  No, you're not understanding my point, though, really. 
[00:22:30]  If you had, if Jim Norton, look at Jim Norton's poor mother and father, what they got to go  to home.  Exactly.  They have a successful son.  The bottom line is this.  I asked you why it bothered you, and what's the problem with it?  Well, no, it doesn't hit close to home.  It kind of does, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry for that.  Well, what about all the other things that we make fun of?  Like the things that have wrecked my life and AIDS, which has affected everyone.  Why is that okay?  But something that hits close to...  Jim Norton's life is an open book on this show. 
[00:23:00]  He beats himself up more than he beats others up.  Yeah, I know.  But just turn around and say someone's son's a disaster.  With my four, I smoke too much pot.  What are you kidding me?  I didn't say that.  There was a little anger in the room.  I thought you were so upset, you tuned away.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought you...  Yeah, you're still listening.  Why were you listening?  And that was...  I work in the city.  I drive my truck right in front of the station.  I've come up and talked to you about it right now.  And you got a little troll that tells me I'm a tough guy?  Yeah, I am a tough guy. 
[00:23:30]  Why don't you...  First of all...  Mikey.  You have a problem with me.  Keep your problem pointed at me.  But stop blaming me for everything that everybody says on the show.  If you're going to just...  You talk like a little troll.  You see?  Stop trying to be funny, Mike.  Mike, stop trying...  I don't care if you like me.  Drive your truck drunk into a wall.  I don't care if you like me or not.  I'm talking to Jim Norton.  I know.  I am Jim Norton, you jackass.  Oh, my God.  You are stupid, Mike.  Oh, Jimmy, stop it.  You little troll, you. 
[00:24:00]  That was Anthony.  That was Anthony.  All right, Mike.  We got to go.  All right, guys.  Is it okay if we make fun of the blacks next?  Yeah, screw you.  You'd have fun with that, right?  Listening to that?  I got a black...  I got a black...  You know, whatever.  I know.  A black what?  What would you like us to make fun of?  Seriously.  What would Mike like us to make fun of?  Some of the towel heads and stuff, you know.  We do enough of that.  All we do is trash them.  You know, and there's some nice towel heads out there.  And then we're going to have to take phone calls from them.  Now you're pushing it.  That is one or two. 
[00:24:30]  I understand your point, but just maybe a little pissed off.  All right, Mike.  We'll move on soon.  Go listen to Z100 or something for a few minutes.  We'll be done with this soon.  Come here and smack in your head.  How's that?  That doesn't matter, man.  You can do that.  It would be very hard.  You know something?  Let me tell you something, Mike.  Let me tell you something, Mike.  Keep up the act that you're coming down to kick our ass, and you know what's going to happen?  You're going to get your ass beat and thrown in jail.  That's all that's going to happen.  That's all that's going to happen. 
[00:25:00]  I'm just being honest with you.  You pussies.  That's what's going to happen.  Pussies, pussies, pussies.  Three little five-foot-nothing pussies.  Goodbye.  And he hangs up.  And then he hangs up again.  There he goes.  I didn't say that, Mike.  No one hung up on you.  I didn't say that, Mike.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's go right to the phones.  Ken in Ohio.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys? 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Ken.  Hey, I was laughing so hard.  I don't know who actually made the comment, but you hit the nail right on the head.  I have a son nine years old and has sounds.  But, you know, all the funny stuff you guys do, you've got to laugh.  I mean, I'm sure if my wife's listening when I get home, I'll get my butt kicked.  But it is.  It's funny.  I mean, stuff happens, crap happens.  You can't change it, but you can't laugh about it.  What are you going to do?  We all have our crosses.  All right, Ken.  Well, the key is with cringe humor, it's like anything awful hurts somebody.  It's like if you draw the line with comedy, like as a general subject, then there's really 
[00:26:00]  nothing you can make fun of.  Even drunk driving is a safe thing.  Like, I was drinking.  I got a pull.  But, you know, is drunk driving funny when you break it down?  No, it's awful.  We try to make fun of everything.  We try.  Exactly.  And there's some stuff, like I said, doesn't harm, bothers some people, but, you know,  laugh at some stuff, other stuff, the I let go, other stuff.  I mean, don't get pissed off.  People, people.  We had a really pissed off woman from Philly, but she hung up.  Oh.  I hope she calls back.  The reason that I'll do stuff like that is because the things that hurt me on a personal 
[00:26:30]  level, like that I find really personally very sad or hurtful, like, look, I make fun  of them, too.  Yeah, you have to.  I don't just keep my own stuff safe.  Exactly.  I love to know.  You guys aren't afraid to hit anything, you know?  That's life.  You deal with it.  Even stuff that, yeah, affects us personally.  The thing is, I think all of us in this room really enjoy dark humor.  Yeah.  There's that gallows humor that all of us enjoy, and it's twisted, but we hit, you know,  all the subjects. 
[00:27:00]  Exactly.  We hit all the bad, like, nasty, despicable subjects and find some kind of a sick joke  in there.  A twist on it.  You know, you've got to have some humor or something.  I mean, if you can't laugh at it, then, you know, I mean, there's nothing else out there.  You've got to have something to, you know, to relax it.  All right.  Can we get your point?  Thank you so much.  Thanks, man.  Dancing as fast as I can.  Let's get back to the funny Donnie in Boston.  Yeah, I'm just wondering if that fine young couple registered at Toys R Us. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  And with that, we go back to the clips because we're running out of show here.  Which one are we going to play?  We didn't hear the guy, the groom.  All right.  Yeah.  We didn't hear him yet.  We didn't hear Sujit.  Also has Down syndrome.  Took him a long time.  No, we heard about him.  We didn't hear him.  Took him a long time to learn the right words to express himself.  Yeah.  We played that, right?  We didn't hear him talk, though.  Did we play that?  We heard that clip.  We heard that clip.  All right.  Let's move on here.  Sujit met Carrie at a Down syndrome convention.  Oh, my God. 
[00:28:00]  That must have been a treat to accidentally book a room with that.  No sleep that night.  Sujit has a special nickname for her.  And then whoever put this together for us, probably Danny, it says, you may want to pause  right before he says it to come up with your own nicknames.  All right.  He also entertains at nursing homes and events for people with Down syndrome.  And when he encountered Carrie Bergeron at a National Down Syndrome Congress in Pittsburgh,  it was love at first sight.  I said to my parents, this is the girl that I really want to date and to have someone in 
[00:28:30]  my life.  Do you have a special name for her?  Anyway, do you see?  And this is what drives me nuts.  Like, a guy like Mike will get pissed off at us.  But do you see what that guy in the media just did?  Do you have a special name for knowing he's going to get something good?  Yeah.  And he's doing it under the guise of being a concerned newsman when he's trying to get  something screwed up.  If that was a regular couple, do you think he'd say, do you have a nickname for your wife? 
[00:29:00]  No.  No.  No.  But he knows this one is going to be a gem.  He's got a nickname.  A doozy.  He's got a Lulu.  By the way, do you know if that was him playing the piano?  No, that's actually what he hears in his head all day long.  Three minutes left.  Holy crap.  It was either that or a tree, lady. 
[00:29:30]  Care Bear.  Care Bear.  All right.  Want to move right on so we can maybe finish this up?  Yes.  On their own excursions, including trips in a rowboat on the lake behind the Desai's house,  they were, in a very real sense, escaping into uncharted walls.  See them in the sand in a rowboat?  It is rare for people with Down syndrome to marry. 
[00:30:00]  The parents there with a drill.  Pretending they were all the nightstand.  Showing a hole in the bottom of it.  I won't tell if you don't.  They're scuba diving with a drill.  Syndrome to marry.  Carey loved pretending they were on the Titanic the way it was in the movie.  I'm so glad I'm with you, Jack.  I'm not going to leave you.  Oh, God. 
[00:30:30]  The question of children was settled by Carey's decision to undergo a surgical procedure to prevent conception.  Ah.  Since the likelihood of having a Down syndrome child would be high,  and it would be virtually impossible for Carey and Sujit to care for a child on their own.  Children is a big responsibility, and we just have to be responsible for ourselves, really.  She shouldn't bring up the Titanic, because they had to make some tough choices on that boat.  Women and children first. 
[00:31:00]  Water heads last.  Oh, God.  Who was she kidding?  Exactly.  That's why the Titanic sank.  It was actually those two in a rowboat, and they hit one of their heads.  All right.  We've got one more minute left here.  I think we can squeeze this in, hopefully.  For her first dance with Sujit as husband and wife,  Carey wanted her sister Wendy to sing the theme from Titanic,  no doubt heard at thousands of weddings since it became such a stand-up.  And you're here in my heart, and my heart will go on and on. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  In a world where we often honor people with special needs as inspirations  for achievements beyond our expectations,  but may look away from issues such as loneliness,  this couple had their own interpretation of the world.  What does that song mean to you?  It means no matter where we are in life,  we will never grow apart. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah?  This is her singing there.  Oh, no.  If you really love somebody, never, ever quit.  Oh, no.  Don't ever think that.  Part may go on, but your education won't do it.  When you really love somebody, you will know.  Oh, God.  Whatever.  That is inspiring.  That's the modern-day freak show right there.  They played her singing.  The dream is a star.  That is my dream. 
[00:32:30]  We're roasting soon.  I see it blow.  I see it blow.  I see it blow.  I'll take it to myself.  While the water pour.  And it disguised  The blue  The man in white 
[00:33:00]  The color of the rainbow  The beauty and white  I'm taking for myself  And the wonderful world  The colors of the rainbow  So pretty in the sky  Are also on the faces 
[00:33:30]  Of people going by  I see them shaking hands  Saying how you do  They're really saying  I love you  My faith is good  My worship road  The wind is warm  I'll ever know 
[00:34:00]  And I'm thinking myself  What a wonderful world  And I'm thinking myself  What a wonderful world  Hey, this is TJ Miller 
[00:34:30]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  Alright, let me unzip  What happened  In Camden, New Jersey  This past Saturday  With Bill Burr  Stuff of legend  It really is  I suggest you go to YouTube  And check out the entire performance  Of him just taking on  The entire  Crowd  But we have some highlights here 
[00:35:00]  A little booing going on  There were a couple of little booers  Out in the crowd  Yeah, we should set this up again  Just in case people weren't listening  Yesterday there, Jimmy  What was the vibe?  What, I mean  What was going on?  It was getting rough  They booed Jimmy Schubert early  I mean, again  Philly is notoriously rough  And then Tracy got them back  And, you know  The show was going well  But Philly crowds were always on the verge  They were right on the brink 
[00:35:30]  Always  At any minute  And the second half of the show started  Bobby Kelly went out  And just kicked ass  Boss killed  Everybody, for the most part, killed  Jimmy Schubert  Jimmy Schubert was destroyed  I'm gonna give Drew Boogie some props  He did a great job as a DJ, man  He held it together  I mean, believe me  That's a lot more important  Than people realize  To keep the music going  Keep people happy  With what they're listening to  And then Bobby Kelly kills  Dom Herrera goes out  He's doing well  And then he loses them a little bit  They boo him a little bit  Which is really weird  To see a rare get booed 
[00:36:00]  He's such a good comic  I know, and a legend  But it was late  And again, these psychos  Have been drinking since 11am  So, I mean  They're getting a little rowdy  They booed him a little bit  But he handled it  He handled it better than Schubert did  Because Schubert, I think  Just like went on autopilot  Whereas Dom kind of  I think addressed it a little bit  Or slowly  Whatever he did  He made it work  And he left  Billy Berry comes on  And from what I saw  Bill's first bit or something  Didn't work  Which happens a lot to us  As comics  You know what I mean?  You just come on  And your bit doesn't hit  It's no big deal  You want to open strong 
[00:36:30]  Though, don't you?  Yeah, but you do  But again, Billy  Is in a position on the show  Everybody knows him  And likes him  And he's really funny  So he doesn't have to prove himself  It's like if you're bombing  For 10 minutes  They're going to give you a hard time  Right  But one bit  They'll usually  Yeah, no big deal  But I think Bill got annoyed  At them because they booed Herrera  And said something to them  About it  I was watching this on a monitor  And then they started booing him  Started booing Bill  And it got really loud  And I'm like  Are they booing Burr?  And then I just heard him snap  And he had a moment of clarity 
[00:37:00]  Yeah  He was going to go down  And bomb horribly  Or he was going to attack back  And he attacked back  He knew  In a lovely fashion  He had time backstage  To say to himself  Look, if this happens to me out there  I know how I'm going  I know what direction I'm taking  He was a third guy  So he threw his act away  Yep  And then just improv  For like 12 minutes  And just beat up Philly  Slammed him  Everyone is talking about this  Yes  Everybody is talking about this performance  So  Tham, what's the first clip?  Him getting into the rant? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, that's when the wheels start  Well  The wheels don't come off  I guess because he killed  But yeah  It's just him  It's none of his actual  Like normal bits  Right  It's just the start of  When he starts losing it  Okay  So yeah  The set up basically  He did his act  He started doing his act  The booing started  And he said  You know what?  Screw you all  And this is what started to happen  You don't stop talking, do you?  Like, ah, f*** it  I'll just cook this side for a while  You know what's funny? 
[00:38:00]  I'm cooking my brain  Talking about nothing  I'm just walking around  Like, yeah, I just got a cheeseburger  Oh, f*** all you people  You know what?  You f*** losers  I hope you all f***ing die  And I hope the f***ing Eagles  Never win the Super Bowl  The f***ing die  All you. 
[00:38:30]  oh my god how many beefs are in that was at the beginning of the uh of the tirade right there  oh yeah yeah funny you could see bill with the line about the cheeseburger as a comic he could 
[00:39:00]  see right there he's really like floundering internally going all right that was his moment  of truth like right i'm gonna try to just turn this around with this and and then it just they  gave him a little hard time that was that was him standing at the crossroad right there it was like  all right do i continue with the cheeseburger joke just talking because i think he felt again like  you said the wheels coming off he was trying to steer all right let me get back off the shoulder  here and then he just kind of saw his wheel rolling in front of the car and he just aimed for the  children is this worth playing with all the the beeps i think it's at least play a couple of clips 
[00:39:30]  i think it's funny with the beeps to just show how it is funny with the business it was yeah please  play a little it took me over two hours to do all right no problem uh but uh the people listening  on xm don't worry later on this morning we're gonna play the whole thing yeah entirety without  the beeps no bitching you'll have to hear a couple commercials but aside from that we'll play it for  you no bitching bill's thing is sponsored by bud and for the people that don't have xm just go to  youtube and uh throw opian anthony in the search and you'll get to see this uh for yourself as well 
[00:40:00]  or get xm or get it yeah how about you throw that out there as an option no i you gotta balance  the two here don't you get what's going on well he means today too they don't push xm if you push  xm too much then the people down the hall here get pissed oh i know and if you don't push xm enough  then xm down there in washington gets pissed it's a balancing act we're we're like spinning plates here  i'm looking at i'm looking at poor uh elo's face over here on uh pal talk and you know i just figured 
[00:40:30]  hey there's an option perhaps do you think i was saying it without saying it that's how smart i am  i was keeping everybody happy i don't like his creepy goatee it hasn't grown in yet i don't care he  looks puerto rican and i don't like it all right here's some more bill burr takes on philly on stage  at the tweeter center this is where he gets into the whole cancer thing harold carmichael jerseys by the  way it made me really happy  i'm going to be up here talking about it that ain't gonna work what do you want me to talk about

[00:42:00]  set i'm doing every single minute i was supposed to do he's counting down every minute he's doing  that takes balls is it worth playing we'll continue i just love hearing the beeps actually  at the end there i don't even know what he was saying it was just beep beep beep  well then he got into the ben franklin bridge down there in philly  i hope you all get in your force focuses  drive off the side of that faggot ass ben franklin bridge

[00:55:00]  it at home  last night  I cannot  get enough  of it  it is  the most  watchable  act  I've ever  seen  it's like  you could  look at it  you could  watch it  ten times  and catch  something new  every time  animals  yeah  I literally  had a headache  at the end  I felt like  I yelled  at a relative  you  you know  what it  reminded me  of  it's like  somebody  that should  get the  congressional  medal  for  rushing  a machine  gun  nest  and actually  living  through it  and one 
[00:55:30]  man  single-handedly  took out  an entire  machine gun  nest  and bunker  emplacement  thought you  were gone  thought you  were dead  you turn  that around  can you walk  us through it  because we  just we have  no idea  what really  happened  we're just  getting phone  calls and  things like  that  you walked  out on  stage  I guess  it was  after  Dom Herrera  no it was  actually it  was after  the show  was about  three hours  and 15  minutes old  right  ideally  about 90 
[00:56:00]  minutes  is the  ideal comedy  show  yes and  you want  to go on  probably 50  minutes into  the 90  minutes at  the latest  ideally  the people  aren't drinking  in a parking  lot for seven  hours  before the  three hours  and 15  minutes  starts  it was  basically  I don't  know what  it turned  into Oz  Fest  up on the  lawn  and they  were booing  guys  like even  guys who  were doing  well  I was kind  of walking  to the  side  and they  were booing  and it was  just getting  worse and  worse  so you  heard where 
[00:56:30]  it was  coming from  I really  had no  idea  they kept  saying it  was up to  the left  it sounded  to me  when I was  out there  like it  was coming  from  everywhere  but  so anyway  so  then Dom  goes out  and Dom's  doing a great  job  and it's  almost like  they just  decided  yeah  out of  nowhere  this guy's  like from  Philly  he's been  doing it  forever  half the  reason they  got comedy  clubs in  that damn  city  is because  this guy  they boo  him off  like they  don't even  know him  so  unbelievable  and he's  Dom's funny  he doesn't 
[00:57:00]  deserve to be  booed  he's a great  comic  exactly  so  I was  pissed  and I  went out  there  and the  second I  walked out  I was like  you know  hey  you know  whatever  I was walking  down the  street  did you  they started  yelling  and heckling  and then  went into  that Hitler  bit  and I was  like oh  no  they've been  playing this  on Opian  Ante like  9,000 times  and I kind  of messed  that up  and then  they started  booing me  and fortunately  I had been  booed before  and I  I had made  mental notes  about things 
[00:57:30]  that I did  that I liked  and didn't  like  and there  was a lot  more stuff  that I  didn't like  so I  just  I had made  a mental  note  the next  time  whatever  happened  I'm talking  about all  your mothers  I'm trashing  your city  anything I can  think about  and I'm not  the Liberty Bell  Rocky  the Betsy Ross  Bridge  cheese steaks  the fact they  hate blacks  the sports teams  exactly Anthony  I swear to God  I already mentally  worked it out  if they started  throwing stuff  I was going to  go behind the DJ  booth and I was 
[00:58:00]  I was still going  to finish  I just was not  you were dedicated  to finishing  oh yeah  I was in the back  watching  oh it was fantastic  again because you  couldn't hear the  audience response  from the monitors  and I saw you go  what are you people  not going to laugh  like you just  scolded them  like Bill  because you  are like  I hate to say  money in the bank  it's a faggot  expression  but you never  had bad sets  especially gigs  like this  I'm like how  could they give  Bill a hard time  and then you just  went crazy  it was so good  and he made  all this up  so great  off the cuff  and we need  to tell people  that again  this wasn't 
[00:58:30]  your act  this wasn't  what you decided  to do in Philly  you were just  making it up  as you go along  in front of  10,000 people  that to me  I bow to you  today  that was the  funny thing  I had a bunch  of people  that had come  up to me  out of all  those people  afterwards  probably at least  15 people  had come up  to me  and they were  like did you  just make  that up  or is that  like part of  your act  that's 15  minute chunk  of my act  when I go  to Seattle  I just go  off on  specific stuff  about Philly  and somehow  it kills  that's what  I was amazed  at too  it's like  god this guy  knows a lot  about Philly 
[00:59:00]  dude you should  be gleaning  tours there  in your time  off of his  fighting  everything about  Philly  he just recalled  stuff subconsciously  that he heard  in school  it was like  your whole  brain worked  for you  and the team's  old players  from the  Phillies  like he's  Roman Gabriel  he's pulling  up old players  from  Joe Frazier  you mentioned  Roman Gabriel  and the lack  of respect  he gets  you don't know  who he is  you just  you mentioned  him  they're not 
[00:59:30]  gonna win  ever  they're never  gonna win  it was good  to see the real  Bill Burr  finally  because we know  this is what  you're really  about  and it finally  came out  for everybody  it was fantastic  to watch  you saw the reason  why I need  to do this  to me  when I was  watching that  like when  you're watching  you yell  like that  and just  just  just berate  them  I'm like  that's what  Bill hears  in his head  every time  he looks  into the mirror  I never loved  anyone as much  as I loved  watching you  do that  and you  you completely 
[01:00:00]  turned them  around  when you were  done  and you did  your little  countdown  every  every minute  like I said  there's a teleprompt  they're showing  the comics  how much time  they had left  and you'd  berate the audience  and they go  okay six minutes  and you kept  going and going  and I'm selling  my CDs  and I'm selling  my CDs  and then you  turned them  around  they're laughing  their asses  off  now the laughs  are much bigger  than the boos  but the boos  continued  right  and you knew  you had them  and then you're like  and I still hate  you people 
[01:00:30]  yeah I still  hate you people  and when you  left  they gave you  a hell of an  ovation  just for doing  I gotta tell you  it was one of the  most amazing  things I've ever  seen  I never saw  a set like  that in my  life  as far as  comic things  go  the brutal  honesty of what  you did  and the fact  that it was  it looked  fearless  I mean as a comic  I understand how  we are internally  but just the fact  that you exploded  and weren't gonna  back down  and they knew  he's not leaving  he's not leaving  he will not leave  you can only boo  so loud  so they just knew 
[01:01:00]  that you were gonna  kick 10,000 people  in the face  for 15 minutes  until your time  was up  and it was just  great  Tony Montana  up on the balcony  getting shot  come on  and that guy  that guy walked up  to your back  with a shotgun  and you turn around  and you slapped him  with your hog  it was blind rage  by the end  to the point  when I got off  I wasn't even  I was  really when I walked  back there  I didn't know  what the reaction  of you was  we all ran to the stage  because you know  the word spread 
[01:01:30]  Bill Byrd's getting booed  and he's just  attacking the crowd  we all  every single person  backstage just about  was on the side stage  just watching  we're jumping up  and down  we're hugging each other  we're falling on the ground  like idiots  we loved it  having gay sex  just had a mention  that's right  that's what I told myself  in the rest area last night  this one's for Billy  and someone bootlegged it  it's up on YouTube  and the word hasn't  even really spread  I mean now it has  obviously  because we're talking about 
[01:02:00]  but this morning  it was already downloaded  thousands of times  I'm like  man  people are talking  about this thing  you go to YouTube  and just throw  Opie and Anthony  in the search  and there it is  it's there  the first time  I got booed  that  there's this amazing  feeling  when you just  realize you can't  get them back  and the first time  I got booed  I didn't leave  that time  but  I kept trying  to do jokes  or something  I didn't leave  or whatever  and then they ended up  bringing me off  and people came up  to me afterwards  going  I got like  these awful compliments 
[01:02:30]  like  I thought you were funny  oh hey yeah  and the best one  you mean all the compliments  Jimmy Schubert  was getting  after his set  I mean that too  he just got thrown  to the dogs  oh my god  Jimmy Schubert  it's hilarious  that was the thing  because I love Jimmy  so I was pissed  from the beginning  of the show  and having gotten booed  I know what he was  going through  then he's got to  stand there  for the  what was it  the five hours  and you two guys  Jesus Christ  before I go up  these two  stand up virgins 
[01:03:00]  hey we got this  great idea  we're going to walk  40 rows  through the crowd  yeah  that's great  anything you can do  to steal their focus  more from the  so we get credit  for your brilliant set  that people will be  talking about for years  and then they go  to the concert  and right after we  intro you 50 rows in  the two stars  of the show  we're just going to  cut out the lights  and they're not going  to look at us  and try to find out  where we're going  I thought that was  a little ridiculous too  like I was like  uh oh  this could be distracting 
[01:03:30]  to the comedian  we make it up  as we go along  what can I tell you  we won't do that again  Bill  but Jimmy Schubert  was your biggest cheerleader  on the side of the stage  he was jumping up and down  just applauding  oh yeah  oh we were joking  about that afterwards  I go  I felt like we caught  the last chopper  on a nom  we were going to look down  and see like  Dom Irera  like Willem Dafoe  in the tree line  oh it was brutal  it was unbelievable  you must have seen him  it was platoon  you must have seen him  though getting booed  know what it's like  to be booed 
[01:04:00]  saw what the crowd  is like  and kind of prepared  yourself like  if these sons of bitches  even try  I am unloading  my mindset when I walked out  was you animals  you don't even deserve a show  I'm going to come out here  and I'm going to start  tap dance  and try to get your attention  you're not even giving  anybody any chances  so the second they started  moving you were already  locked and loaded  ready to go  I'm talking about  it's like I don't know  I don't know why  I even ironed  my shirt to come out  I don't even remember  half the stuff  I said it was  oh my god  total terrestrial  I've watched it like 
[01:04:30]  ten times already  it is all good  and it is all brutal  yeah  it's just fantastic  I've never  ever seen a set like that  I've never seen anyone handle  a stupid heckler  in a club  is one thing  you got 10,000 people  and you just  trashed them  to the point  where they loved you  when you left  hey what's going on  this is Bill Burr  you're listening to the worst  of Opie and Antony  Opie and Antony  Opie and Antony  Opie and Antony  Opie and Antony  Opie and Antony  Opie and Antony 
[01:05:00]  It's the worst  Danny you really need  to drink more  Opie and Antony  Birds are faggots  Useless  Really are  This is how stupid  they are  When they're in the cage  if you throw like a towel  over it  they think it's night  How do you not just  kill those things  on principle  Bunch of dopes  How do they survive  and morph from dinosaurs  to become such dopes  A pillowcase  makes it night time  It's five  It's four in the afternoon  Pillow 
[01:05:30]  Oh well  It's dark  Alright  These should be the smartest  things on the face  of the earth  being around that long  They're the last  of the dinosaurs  Last of the dinosaurs  They can fly for God's sake  Ah the rooster's crowing  First thing in the morning  Towel  How am I going to get up  for work  It's so late  Every time I see a bird  I want to grab it 
[01:06:00]  by the tail feathers  and smash it into a wall  Look it's night  Just be a bad pet owner  and just keep taking  the pillowcase off  and on  On and off  On and off  On and off  I must be 50 years old  by now  So many days  have gone by  Chomp chomp  That's what you do  to old people  Whenever they start  talking to you  once you throw  a face cloth on them  they just think it's night  and fall asleep  Oh it's so dark  I've missed my programs  When I was your age 
[01:06:30]  Shut up  Towel  You know  your father  was the  Towel  Old bird body  grandma  She still got coffee  in her hand  towels over her  dumb old face  You're spilling it  Stop  You're spilling it  Put this towel 
[01:07:00]  over your head  and go to sleep  your grandson  Frank  How do animals  fall asleep  so quickly  I tossed and turned  for two hours  last night  on comfy feather pillows  That annoy the hell  out of you  when you watch  a cat curl up  and just click  he's asleep  He doesn't have to  worry about anything  Birds are scanning up  holding onto something  with their feet  so they don't fall over  and paralyze themselves  and there they are  La La Land  Sleeping  The hell  I know  I'm rolling  waking up 
[01:07:30]  at three in the morning  can't get back  to sleep  How do you sleep  and hold on  for dear life  at the same time  What about  the flamingos  that stand on one leg  and go to sleep  One leg  Try that one at home  Just tuck a leg  under your armpit  and now go to sleep  Why do they tuck  the other  I don't understand that  They want to keep warm  It's dopey  You know what  the worst part is  Oh no  See exactly  I knew it  What's the matter  Tom Chiasano  just walked in  and he's a bird owner  Oh no 
[01:08:00]  I want to complain  about your insensitivity  to birds  I own birds  What kind do you have  I have an African  gray parrot  Does it talk to you  Oh yeah  It's a talking bird  Unfortunately  the talking bird  sounds all well and fine  but most of the time  they're just going  What is that  I like when they go like  Hello  Hello  Hi  Hi  Tom  Tom  But you walk past  and they go  Your neighbors think 
[01:08:30]  a murder is going on  at your house  You spend an hour  trying to get the damn thing  to say one lousy word  One word  It's just screaming at you  You just talk stupid  This bird talks up  a blue streak  Really  Yeah  What does it say  All sorts of stuff  All sorts of stuff  All sorts of different stuff  Yeah  It says  We taught it to be  May the force be with you  How old is this bird  Does it wear glasses  A geek bird  It's like 18 years  Wow  Really  This bird will outlive me 
[01:09:00]  Easy  They live like 50 years  Does it say  Why didn't you give me  more money  In February  It was going  You should have hired me  instead  Wow  How old do they  How old do they get  They live to be like 50  Jeez  50 or 60  And is it true  You put the cover on  Oh yeah  At night  Yeah  You cover him up at night  Then it falls right to sleep  Good night 
[01:09:30]  He says yeah  Good night  It's good towel  You idiot  Right  I mean it only says  It only says good night  Because they've heard  My wife and I  Saying good night to it  And my son saying good night to it  For the years when  We would cover him up  Nothing inappropriate  It's all conditioned  It's all conditioned response  The bird doesn't say  Anything inappropriate  Maybe he heard a couple of things  No  One of my son's friends  Told him to say cook me  That's about it  That's about it  No like dirty words  It's FCC compliant  Yes it is  As a matter of fact  I think it would have been  A better hire before us  To hire the bird 
[01:10:00]  Hey it's my bird  Of course it's FCC compliant  I would listen to a whole radio show  Hosted by a  Hosted by a talking bird  Yeah why not  A boozy boozy bop  Sorry  Plus we have four others  Four  You have five birds  You have five birds  Okay  Crazy bird people  Crazy cat people  My wife is  Dander allergic  To dogs and cats  So we got birds  Birds  Two parakeets  Parakeets just sing though 
[01:10:30]  Right  They're the coolest  Of the birds  They make the best noise  Yeah  A Belgian canary  Which sings beautifully  And a Madagascar parrot  Which is blinded  One eye  My wife took in  As a mercy mission  Hey Jim  Does it talk also  No  No  Hey Jim  Can you throw a towel  Over Tom please  I'm done  I'm done  Tom just nods off  When you put a towel  Over his head  I can see where  This is going  Alright  I'm out of here  Tom  Tom what's the matter  Well we have five  No more

[01:11:30]  Of holes near the windows  And big patches  Missing from the carpet  Birds are loud though  My grandmother  Had it years ago  They just make noise  That's all they do  When they can talk  It is wonderful  It's fun  I like when you see  A big parrot somewhere  And it's talking  But like I said  Most of the time  Can we lock that  Side door please  Holy crap  If Tom wants to  Come in and contribute  That was his first  Appearance on the show  And it was terrific  He had a bird information  Brett what's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey  I got a question 
[01:12:00]  How come they didn't  Dump out on Tom  When he talked about  His bird eating carpet  Oh check out  The big brain on Brett  No why  Because he put  The listeners to sleep  And the guy behind  The dump button to sleep  Alright boys  You gotta be awake  To dump out of the program  The FCC would try  To listen to that  Part of the show  And they'd all doze off  That's known  As a verbal towel  I'm a bird owner  I got many birds  Do ya  I thought it was nice  To learn a little something  You enjoyed the bird talk  With Tom Chiasano

[01:22:30]  Seemed like a good team  To work with  And right now  They are  And we're having  A good run  The book's finished  And we're very proud of it  It kind of feels like  It's got like a  Textbook feel to it  It's all got  Pretty cool paper  It's not like  That dry awful paper  I like the feel  Of a lot of photos  Yes  Yes  And by you know  Harry Benson  And Neil Leifer  And Bart Silverman  Are some top notch  Photographers  Yeah  And now  How about  The girls  Are there any  Talk about the girls  In here  Because that's  You know  The legendary  Joe Namath  We would love to know  About the girls  Well 
[01:23:00]  I've talked about  Most things  That were pertinent  That I could share  With the reader  This is basically  A book to be shared  With the family  And the DVD  That's added to it  By NFL Films  Is a very fine DVD  I've never  You know  I've worked on  Four books now  I had help  With Dick Schaap  And Bob Oates Jr.  On three of them  This one was different  Certainly 
[01:23:30]  And it was more difficult  And took longer  To get done  But I enjoyed  The process  Now Joe  I've got to ask you  In this book  Does it include  Probably the pinnacle  Of your career  Playing catch  With young Bobby Brady  On the Brady Bucks  Yeah  Old Bobby tried  To fool me that time  I remember that  You know  You didn't have to be  Such a nice guy  And go over their house  For God's sake  The guy's lying  That he knows you  Yeah we caught him 
[01:24:00]  No see  We taught him a lesson  Said he was sick  And then Joe  Being nice  Goes over  And sees this sick boy  And it turns out  That his father was sick  Yeah  And  You didn't walk into your trailer  And have to throw  Mr. Brady out  Did you  Yeah  I'm sure  I'm sure Mr. Brady  Really took a liking to you  It's pretty amazing  The Brady Bunch  Had such a following  To this day  Of course  People will say  Hey I remember  The Brady Bunch  You did  And that's  It's a kick  Go out for a pet  You should have  Drilled one  Right into his head 
[01:24:30]  Hey you know  They put him  In a harness  And raised him  About 30 feet  Over the stage  And then crossed  The stage  With him up there  30 feet  He crossed  I wouldn't have  Gotten up there  No  He went above  And beyond  The call of duty  I thought  Very memorable episode  You're right up there  With Davey Jones  Are you disgusted at all  With like a lot of the players today  Like  Maybe it's just perception  The media coverage  Is different  Are they like really  As arrogant and awful  As they seem  Like they seem a little bit  Different back  Like you know  30 years ago 
[01:25:00]  Well it certainly  Was different  But guys  You know  Things have been changing  For a good while now  We're not seeing anything new  That hasn't existed  Since the 80s  You know  The NFL has  Done a pretty good job  And policing the players  Behavior out there  And trying to keep it  Focused on the game  But you have  Show business  More in the game  Today than ever before  I personally don't like  That they're policing  All that  I love all the showboating  It makes it so  So exciting  All the crap  They're doing  In the end zone  And stuff  Right 
[01:25:30]  But some of it  Is certainly out of place  Any kind of taunting deals  And premeditated stuff  You know  We are a team  Out on the field  But when the individual  Of the stuff  Starts taking center stage  I know it's good  For home entertainment  But for teamwork  And the rest of the group  They don't really care for that  Yeah but they take care  Of their own  I mean if you're showboating  Too much  You know  You're going to pay  Down the road  Of course  Of course  But this has been going 
[01:26:00]  I remember when  Billy White Shoes Johnson  Started doing the dancing  Man  And that was alright  There were a lot of guys  You know  Doing some things  In nice ways  But then it got ugly  It got mean  It kind of got  You know  Out of line  And then it's really  Reach  Guys start reaching  You know  Whenever they're planning  And plotting  What they're going to do  For a game  Rather than play  You know  They're not quite focused  You know  When you're doing  A five step dance routine  In the end zone  It really is kind of  Uncomfortable to watch  Or pull out a cell phone  You know 
[01:26:30]  Oh didn't he  Grab the cell phone  Behind him  Yeah  That really is pompous  Yeah  Joe I got a memory of you  I used to be a caddy  At the Huntington Crescent Club  And I was maybe  Fourteen or fifteen  At the time  And you came to play  A round of golf  This goes back a few years  And you were out there  And every single  Female member  Followed you around  That day  You didn't even know  They were following you around  Because they were hiding  In the bushes  And behind trees 
[01:27:00]  And stuff  Joe was hiding  In the bushes later  That evening  But it was unbelievable  How many women  Were following you around  Just as you played  One round of golf  At the Huntington Crescent Club  Back in the day  Why didn't you tell me  I was just a  I was a nobody  Joe was  It was Broadway Joe man  You were  You were quite the showman  Back then  You know  But when you mention caddy  And you bring back  Some memories too  Because I did that  For about six years  And loved it  Yeah  It was one of my  It was probably  My favorite job 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  That was good  I have one complaint  Though  You know  You could have  Picked any broad  On the sideline  And you went after  Susie there  Well  The famous clip  I mean  She's not a looker Joe  I gotta be the one  To tell you  You could have  Any broad in America  And you picked her  I'm sure she's  A fine lady  And she does a good job  On the sidelines  But I mean  Come on Joe  You let us down  Well I have  Apologized  But not because  Of what you say  About her  Beauty's in the eye  Of the beholder  There you go  Hey did you wake up 
[01:28:00]  The next morning  And just go  Thank God  It wasn't Pam Oliver  No but when I did  The next morning  I felt like  A real dog  You know  Whenever I figured out  What had  Trans  Oh no one saw it  It wasn't bad dude  Don't worry about it  It was harmless  No it didn't  Yeah barely anyone  Barely anyone saw it  It was done you know  It was done  And then it was  Time to change the pace  Man  It happened  I'm sure the joking  Continues to this day  Among your circle  Friends though  You guys are bad  You know something Joe 
[01:28:30]  I have to  I have to  Confront you on this  You made a year  Of my life  Miserable  When I was in  Elementary school  Because of that  God damn fur coat  My mother  Who of course  Was in love  With Joe Namath  Saw you in the fur coat  Now when you're  Broadway Joe Namath  And you're  You know  Winning Super Bowls  And you're out there  In the fur coat  It's cool  Going to Hollywood  Premieres  Yeah you're going  To parties  You can wear the fur coat 
[01:29:00]  You're making  CC and Company  Yeah  You're making movies  Yeah  Yeah you know  You're CC Ryder  You're wearing the fur coat  It's cool  My mother went  And got a fur coat  For me  I don't even know  I think I was in like  The third or fourth grade  I got my ass kicked  Because I was wearing  A fur coat  Like a girl  Well it might have been  That ribbon in your hair  You know  Actually she was  Such a Joe Namath fan  She sent me in stockings 
[01:29:30]  Also  Hey did you  Honestly  Did you wear Brute  Of course I did  I did that  Even in college  That's why it was  So much fun  To go to work  With them initially  Yeah  The folks that were  Owners of Fabergé  Were just a terrific group  So I had fun  Yeah  Muhammad Ali  Wore Brute too  You know  And so did  It was something  We enjoyed doing  And it was a great  Company to work with  No high karate  Back then  No  No  Hey Joe  You bring up 
[01:30:00]  Muhammad Ali  Were you ever starstruck  Because I mean  Everyone  Yes  Yes  Yes  Who were you starstruck by  Bob Hope  Gregory Peck  Frank Sinatra  Matt Peck  Yeah  All the biggies  They turned out  Being guys  You know  That I had admired  Their work over the years  But  Yeah  For the most part  They were those  Kind of guys  And  You know  When you meet  Some folks  That have accomplished  Some things  Whether it's political  Or in the arts 
[01:30:30]  It's always fun  Starstruck  Man  I never met  Roberto Clemente  But I was starstruck  With him  Since I was a little kid  You know  I was a big baseball fan  And all  Oh that's right  You're from the Pittsburgh area  Yes  Yes  Just outside of Pittsburgh  But  I never forget  When I first met  Gregory Peck  You know  He had that really deep voice  And they introduced me to him  I said  How do you do Mr. Peck  And he says  Just call me Greg  Joe  I said  Yes sir  Mr. Peck  Yeah  Exactly 
[01:31:00]  I couldn't get myself  To call him Greg  Hey  Was there anybody  In the NFL  That you were scared of  I mean look  You got hit a lot  Was there anybody  That you just wanted  Nothing to do with  Hitting you  Yeah  A whole bunch of them  Man  You know  They were sick  A lot of those guys  What was tough  Is like before a game  You know  You're standing beside  Him for the introductions  And I'll never forget  One time  Standing beside  This defensive end  He was sweating  His eyes were red  He was about 6 foot 8  And I just said to myself  What am I doing here  I really 
[01:31:30]  I mean  Yeah there was some  Folks out there  And there are today  You know  That's their job  Man  They've got a lot  Of enthusiasm  And it's to knock  Other people down  You know  You know  It was fun to watch  Though back then  Where the quarterback  Would scramble  And run with the ball  Like that  Instead of just  Sliding down  Or heading for the  Heading for the sideline  Or something like that  I mean  Obviously it took  Its toll on your body  Well even today  You know  What the NFL has done  And it's not just  For quarterbacks  They've altered the rules 
[01:32:00]  To prevent some injuries  Hopefully so  For the  To the head  And to the knees  And all  And rules that have  Helped the offensive linemen  Defensive players  Help prevent some injuries  The quarterback  A bit of a stretch  I've seen some of the calls  Recently  And you know  If you're a defensive player  You can't believe  That you get a penalty  For that  But if they didn't  Enforce those penalties  Then the teams  Would lose their best players 
[01:32:30]  The fans wouldn't get  The quality of the game  You know  You get two or three  Quarterbacks  Knocked out  Man  It's a hard position  And you're just going to  Have the quality of the game  Go downhill  So I think it also  Helps maintain  A good play  Hey Joe  Who's the best quarterback  In the league right now  Well you know  I'd have to go with  Tom Brady  For past performances  If we had to go  In the one game  Right now  I'd take Tom Brady  Certainly  But in my opinion  I've not seen anyone  Like Peyton Manning  He's one of a kind  He really is amazing 
[01:33:00]  How about the most  Overrated player  What?  I think there's an  Overrated player in the game  Eli Manning  I don't know about  Overrated players  But I also look at  Some young players  And what I've been  Impressed with at this point  Is the quarterback  At Tennessee  There was a lot of  Questions about Evans  And the more I watch him  The more I'm saying  Yeah they're right  About this guy  They're right about this guy  We forget that the guy  Is just a rookie  But  And he won't be  Running around  Downfield a whole lot  Either  But Tennessee's  Coming on 
[01:33:30]  And I'm very impressed  With him as a young  Quarterback  Right on  And who wins  The Super Bowl this year  Joe?  That's the old question  That none of us  Ever know  Until we get there  It seems  Because of Lady Luck  Look what happened  To McNabb  The other day  He gets knocked out  And the Eagles  Aren't going to  Measure up now  They might have  Had a chance  To make the playoffs  But they're not  Going to measure up now  If Lady Luck  Were to  Pull the same  Cruel act  On a few of the  Other players  Not just  Quarterbacks  But if you  Lose  A Manning 
[01:34:00]  If you lose  Brady  You know  Look what Denver's  Doing  I'm a little surprised  Going to Cutler  You know  They're starting  A rookie quarterback  Now  And they're still  Really in the hunt  So that's going  To be interesting  Hey in 99  You were right  96 on the list  Of 100 greatest  Football players  Who was  95th?  I have no idea  What you're talking  About  They listed you  Apparently  We have it in our  Bio here  The Sporting News  Had a list of  100 greatest  Football players  And I was wondering  Who was right ahead  Of you  Because if it 
[01:34:30]  Annoyed you or not  But I'll tell you  There's probably  Got to be a whole  Lot of them  Ahead of old Joe  You guys got to  Remember something  Man  I knew  That I wasn't  Up to speed  When I was coming  In  And there have been  Guys that have  Played many years  Like myself  But have been able  To perform more  Consistently over the  Years  Yeah you had  Personality Joe  Anytime  When I hear  What Paul Bear  O'Brien has to say  Or Vince Lombardi  Or Wee Bue Bank  When those  Pro coaches 
[01:35:00]  And your peers  Have some things  To say about you  That's what I  Listen to  So I'm just  Glad that  Things worked out  And we won  The championship  Well  The book is called  Nameth  Really looks good man  A lot of great photos  A whole history  Of your career  And is it on sale now?  Yes  Less reading  More photos  Always good  Yes  Joe knows that  Lots and lots  Of photos  Very cool talking  To you Joe  Hey thank you  Opie Anthony  You guys take  Care of yourselves  And little Jimmy
