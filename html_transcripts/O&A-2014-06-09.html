<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts detailing significant technical malfunctions in the studio.  They then launched into a discussion about the dangers of texting while driving, comparing it to drunk driving,  before focusing extensively on the serious car accident involving Tracy Morgan.  They detailed the injuries sustained by Morgan, Artie Lange, and Harris,  including the death of James McNair. The hosts expressed concern for the injured and speculated about the accident's cause, also explaining their past relationship with Tracy Morgan and why he hadn't been on the show for years after his success on *30 Rock*.  They also discussed public reaction to the accident on social media and news outlets.

The show then moved to a discussion of the NHL playoffs, reacting to tweets about a specific game.  This transitioned into coverage of the Triple Crown horse race,  specifically playing audio clips of California Chrome's owner's post-race rant about the winning horse not running in prior races and subsequent interviews. The Tony Awards were briefly discussed, along with various Broadway shows, leading into a humorous, critical review of the musical *Rocky*, featuring audio clips and the hosts' commentary.  Sebastian Bach was mentioned as a previous guest who had discussed *Sing Your Face Off*.

The *Sing Your Face Off* segment delved into the show's premise, highlighting the celebrity participants – Sebastian Bach, Lisa Rinna, John Lovitz, and Landry Fields – and finding humor in the absurdity of the transformations, particularly Landry Fields as Nicki Minaj.  They discussed the judges, including Debbie Gibson and Daryl Hammond, mentioning past in-studio appearances and flirtations with Debbie Gibson and Tiffany.  The potential for, and apparent avoidance of, issues like blackface or whiteface was briefly touched upon. The discussion then shifted abruptly to Belle Knox's pornographic reality show, "Sex Factor," with the hosts playing promotional clips and one host expressing interest in participating.  The segment concluded with a food review by a guest called "Iraq," covering Pepperidge Farm Blueberry Cobbler cookies and a watermelon-flavored beer, followed by a discussion of a barbecue festival and the hosts' experiences there. The entire segment was filled with crude humor and offensive language.

A further segment focused on various public apologies, beginning with a discussion of blenders and Dr. Ian Smith's diet books.  This transitioned into reviews of alcoholic beverages and snacks, followed by a discussion of Iraq's weight fluctuations after following the diet. Chris DiStefano's comedy performance was mentioned, alongside a caller's question about bathroom logistics at a barbecue. The hosts then dissected several public apologies: California Chrome's owner, Chris Daughtry (for leaving a *Fox & Friends* segment), Melissa Stetton (referencing her past relationship with Anthony), Gatorade (for mocking LeBron James), and Bob Evans restaurant (for mistreating a breastfeeding mother).  This segment ended with a humorous trailer for a fictional show titled "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?", featuring Joe DeRosa, followed by news stories about a kicked cat named "Punty" and three inmates' failed helicopter prison escapes. A caller then expressed disappointment with the show's recent quality.

Another segment started with a discussion on listener initiative, contrasting it with those attempting to create their own shows.  This led to a review of the FX show *Fargo*, praising its acting and cinematography. A listener called in, initially criticizing the show but then defending them after a fart noise. This was followed by a discussion of a news story about a giant sea monster supposedly eating a great white shark,  speculating on its identity and the data's plausibility. The O.J. Simpson Bronco chase anniversary was mentioned, leading to a discussion on video quality differences between the 1970s and 1990s. Another positive caller chimed in before a discussion about undiscovered ocean creatures, using images from Cracked.com.  The death of Rue McClanahan (incorrectly stated as recent) was mentioned, leading to discussion of the *Golden Girls* cast.  A news story about a man and his mother dying in a Chinese latrine while retrieving a phone was discussed, highlighting differences between modern and less developed areas of China, and contrasted with views based on experiences versus Epcot. The possible appearance of someone resembling Anna Kournikova in the studio was noted, followed by speculation and amusement.

The final segments focused on intern Jenny Hutt, mocking her needy tweets to celebrities (including Rosie O'Donnell and Debra Messing) and her attempts to book guests via Twitter.  Her Twitter activity was extensively analyzed and ridiculed.  The show continued with discussions of Jenny's family relationships, her attempts to get celebrities on her show, and her personality.  A future guest appearance by Dog the Bounty Hunter and Beth was mentioned. The show concluded with Jenny discussing her weight loss journey and exercise routine.  A final segment detailed Jenny's experiences with celebrities, including a negative encounter with Lea Michele (described as "horrible," with Jenny stating "Fuck her"),  positive interactions with Ariana Grande and her mother, a less-than-stellar interview, and humorous speculation about vaginal dryness.  Further crude jokes were made about interactions with other celebrities like Joy Behar and Louis C.K.  The segment ended with promotional announcements for upcoming live shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  ...of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, yes. Good morning, everybody.  Welcome. Welcome aboard.  Ah, let's see.  Oh, well, Basie McGood.  They did test it, by the way.  I like it.  I saw them testing it.  Oh, yeah.  You got a very Basie mic.  It's good. I like it.  La, la, la, la.  What happened? The whole studio shit the bed?  Did it?  When did it shit the bed there, Sam Roberts?  Ah.  Well, we got here on Friday morning, and it was in pieces. 
[00:00:30]  It was in pieces?  Yeah.  Like an explosion?  Yeah.  So if we were here Friday, what would have happened to us?  Yeah, you would have gone right back home, I think.  Oh, damn it.  What would they do in work because they knew the show wasn't here Friday?  I would assume so.  Oh, Mars just yelled yes.  Now, Mars told me he was in studio Thursday night all the way to when?  Friday afternoon.  When did you wake up?  See, I was implying you were sleeping the whole time. 
[00:01:00]  I didn't get that.  I didn't get that.  He's basically saying that your home life is not fun and you're here just to sleep.  Just to snooze.  That was his idea.  With an empty bottle of tequila and a sombrero on the floor.  Jeez.  Oh, my surprise.  That's rum and a lid, I guess.  A little rum.  Oh, rum and like a hubcap.  That would be the same joke for you?  Yeah.  Ah, whatever.  I thought you were Mexican.  I don't know.  The hell do I know?  But it sounds really good, Mars.  We're back.  Yeah.  You pulled the whole... 
[00:01:30]  We'll see how long this lasts.  Why?  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Did you play any pranks?  I'm just kidding.  Oh, God.  Because you know the dugout.  You're amazing.  No pranks, no exploding sliders or buttons that pop out like a jack-in-a-box.  You know the prank was fake, right?  No, it wasn't.  Okay, it was fake.  He was trying to cover his ass going, oh, I was just pranking you guys.  Stupid rain in the city, huh? 
[00:02:00]  That was crazy.  Although we're broadcasting for the whole country, so maybe we shouldn't do local weather.  Yeah.  But they can relate to rain, I guess.  I guess.  Apparently, it rains everywhere.  Everywhere but Arizona.  They're like, what?  What's that shit?  Yeah, yeah.  But, I don't know.  It was figured out perfectly.  Really nice weekend and then rain for Monday.  I'll take that every time.  That is a good situation.  I'll take that every fucking week.  Although that drive-in is a lot of fun when it starts to rain because, I don't know.  I don't know.  And this text, let me tell you about this texting on the road. 
[00:02:30]  It's out of hand.  It's out of fucking hand.  I read an article over the weekend that said, and I've been saying this for years, it's worse  than drunk driving.  I agree.  I'm going to say it.  Worse than drunk driving is texting as you're driving.  I see people weaving off the road.  And if you see one drunk driver when you're driving on a weekend, it's kind of a surprise.  It's like, oh man, I think that guy's hammered.  Right.  I will see 20 people weave out of their lanes because they're texting. 
[00:03:00]  And then you pull up next to them and take a look, and there they are.  Right.  Dink, dink, dink, texting away.  Especially if traffic slows down just a little bit.  Yep.  But there are people, man, 70 miles an hour with that phone down to their side, no problem.  Just looking down.  Trying to get a couple strokes in.  You're taking your eyes off the fucking road like that.  It's unbelievable.  You're hurtling down the highway.  They're going to have to figure something out because people just refuse to stop. 
[00:03:30]  No.  I wasn't going to stop until I got my Samsung.  I've said it a few times.  I couldn't feel the buttons anymore, so it made it a lot harder.  And that was the thing that made me pretty much stop.  I said pretty much stop because I'm like others.  If you think you could squeeze a little in, you're going to try.  But in general, I just don't do it anymore.  It's just so fucking dangerous.  But the BlackBerry, you really knew where your letters were after a while.  It was nice.  You didn't have to look at all.  No.  Kenny likes those tactile buttons. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, they're the worst now.  Tick, tick, tick.  They are absolutely the worst.  When is our watch coming, by the way?  Our new Samsung watch?  Yeah, where's our white glove watch?  And our extra batteries.  Are you using your Samsung?  I have my contacts synced, but I've used it a little bit, but not that much.  I love it.  Yeah, me too.  I love my 5.  But the Aziz.  I love my Samsung 5.  If anyone's not using their phones, I'll take them in a second.  No, I like it.  It's not that you used to.  I've got people that need phones, so.  If they're going to just lay around in a drawer, bring them in.  I'll take them. 
[00:04:30]  No problem.  So I don't feel like buying everyone phones.  Tracy Morgan, our old pal.  I'm starting here.  He's doing okay.  He's still in critical condition, but it's looking like he's got a lot of broken bones.  And they did surgery on his leg, I guess, overnight.  So they're saying that he's got a broken leg, a broken femur, a broken nose, and several  broken ribs in that accident that happened over the weekend on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Sounds like it was pretty fucking bad. 
[00:05:00]  Yep.  Wall Street.  Wall Street.  A Walmart truck.  Tracked a trailer.  Some guy driving.  Obviously was snoozing.  Maybe.  That not slowing down shit.  And traffic slowed up, and he didn't.  Wham!  What do you do?  You're on the highway, and that traffic abruptly stops in front of you.  The first thing I do is just look behind me, begging that everyone else has noticed that  this shit is slowing down drastically, right?  Yeah.  And it seems like that sort of is the case, and he just plowed into them. 
[00:05:30]  I always do that.  You slow down, you look.  You look for some kind of exit, the side of the shoulder or something, and then you look  in the rear view and just go, eh, don't hit me.  I don't pull right up.  I actually leave space and pump the brakes.  That's what I do.  Yeah, so whoever's behind me can see the brakes pumping.  To see that light going on and off, going, oh, wait, okay, something's about to happen  in front of me.  But what?  They were coming home from a gig?  I think in Delaware, yeah.  They were doing a gig in Delaware, and they were on their way home. 
[00:06:00]  Does anyone know how Artie's doing?  That's all I care about.  I mean, I care about Tracy, obviously, but we haven't heard anything on Artie, and it's  freaking me out, because we know Artie pretty well.  Artie Foucault, yeah.  Artie has warmed up for Jimmy many times.  I remember the time at the Borgata for New Year's a few years back, and then he had that  huge fight in the club.  And he took on everybody with a chair like he was a lion tamer.  I'll never forget that, because some guys accused him of taking their bottle and Artie  doesn't even drink.  So he just fought them all. 
[00:06:30]  And then the security just pulled him out, pulled him out off his legs and dragged him  out of the club.  And then a few hours later, I see him just eating.  I'm thinking he's going to get arrested for this crazy shit that was happening in the  club.  Yeah, I don't know.  What a great guy.  Great smile.  He lost his son a few years ago, which was horrendously tragic.  But no updates on him.  Does anyone know?  Someone has to know.  I had heard a broken leg.  But again, that might have been information about Tracy that was confused. 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  Even people at the cellar, I mean, I was only there one of those nights, and nobody  knew, but that was right after it happened.  Harris might know.  I haven't talked to Harris yet.  And Harris was out of the hospital.  And Harris was pretty close with, I don't know Harris that well, but he was pretty close  with Patrice, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's a funny dude, and he was released a few hours later, no?  I'm wondering if Tracy and Artie were in the back of the thing, because I think the drivers  were unhurt, and I'm guessing they were belted in. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  The driver said he got out, was able to get out and try to open some doors, and they  just couldn't open it.  He saw everybody in there, right?  Yeah.  Couldn't really get to anybody.  Sounds like one of those, like, oh boy, that's a bad situation to be in.  Yeah, I mean, Tracy and Artie and Harris are likely to be alive.  That's a fucking, it looked like it had burned, but I guess that was just the photo I saw.  Right.  That was a terrible wreck.  The whole side of the thing was gone.  Yeah.  And James McNair died of injuries sustained in the crash.  I did not know James. 
[00:08:00]  I don't think I did either.  He's an older comic, right?  Supposedly he wrote for Tracy, and some say that it was Tracy's mentor.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think they were pretty close for many years.  And Artie Fuqua's Instagram has pictures of the night before the accident happened.  And it was a huge, successful gig, standing ovation.  And then there's Artie Instagramming a picture before he gets into the limo bus.  Whoops.  Yeah.  It's Artie Fuqua on Instagram.  A-R-D-I-E-F-U-Q-U-A. 
[00:08:30]  If you want to check out the pictures from the night before.  But I just hope Artie's doing all right as well.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  Great guy.  Four nights a week.  He just messes with people outside the comedy cellar, always smiling.  There's just weirdos out there.  People are trying to use the Tracy Morgan thing, and the fact that we've decided not to have  him on our show as a thing.  I don't understand people. 
[00:09:00]  I think there's a lot of mentally ill people out there.  You read Twitter.  It's obvious there's some mentally ill people out there.  I don't read Twitter as much because it's just an ugly, just horrible place.  It really is.  Yeah.  I'd take a peek here and there, but it's just not worth it.  There are mentally ill people out there.  It's kind of scary.  Yeah.  The thing with Tracy Morgan, we go way back with him.  He did our softball games at N.E.W.  He would come out in just a jockstrap.  And then he started doing our show a lot. 
[00:09:30]  And then these are the facts.  If you want to spin them and try to use it to spew your hate, whatever.  But here's the facts.  And he was on our show for many, many years.  And then when he got 30 Rock, he kind of blew us off.  And it bummed us out big time.  And he was gone for about six years, seven years.  And then after 30 Rock was over, he wanted to come back on our show.  And we felt as a show, that's crazy.  We can't do that.  But it doesn't mean we don't like Tracy or don't love Tracy Morgan.  So it's two different issues. 
[00:10:00]  Someone's like, are you going to reconsider now the banning of Tracy on your show?  That's mental illness.  You have mental illness.  That's mental illness.  It's two different issues.  It's also a dumb thing to say.  It's like somebody who's ill-informed.  It's like nobody, it's not a banning, like we're a fucking official organization.  Right.  If a guy says to you time and time again in a way, no, no, because we asked many times.  Yeah, it wasn't us. 
[00:10:30]  We really asked a million times.  And he was in the building and we just never understood it because, like I said, we do go way back with him.  Yeah, so that's what happened there.  But the fact is, it's two different issues.  I love Tracy Morgan.  He's one of the funniest human beings in the world.  When he's not doing his comedy, he's unbelievably funny.  When he's just off the cuff, he's amazing.  He can hold an audience like no one I've ever seen in my life with just complete strangers, you know? 
[00:11:00]  So, but mental illness is just taking over, like Twitter especially.  You could see it more now on Twitter.  The whole mental illness and lunacy.  I guess these people just used to hang out and, you know, just annoy the people that were in their house.  Right.  Now it's just, hey, I got a voice.  Yeah.  Right.  So, whatever.  But it sounds like Tracy's doing all right.  Yeah.  That's the feeling that I'm getting from these articles we're reading. 
[00:11:30]  They said he was yelling for help.  Like I read that in the paper.  Like I've gotten most of my information from the paper as well.  Right.  And, you know, fucking Twitter.  Right.  Like everybody.  But I'm guessing it was that femur.  That's a massive bone to ring.  Oh, yeah.  That's the Brian Regan bit.  Ow.  That's the Brian Regan bit.  Yeah.  The biggest pain you can ever feel.  That's a big bone.  And in a healthy person, it really takes a lot to.  It's the worst bone in your body you could break, I think. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  So, he was awake after that accident yelling.  Holy fuck.  Didn't they say, they closed the turnpike for like five hours, five and a half hours.  Yeah.  And for the turnpike to be closed for five and a half hours, something was really bad.  Yeah.  Right.  Really fucking bad.  I'm glad, Tracy, it looks like it's going to be okay.  And the Walmart driver, what, fell asleep?  Probably, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think he was drunk.  Fell asleep or just, you know, wasn't paying much attention in some way.  That turnpike is a racetrack, man. 
[00:12:30]  Hmm.  I mean, I mean, we all know the turnpike, I guess.  I don't know if things play.  Oh, yeah.  I go, I do the turnpike every other weekend in Philly.  It's a racetrack.  God, you can pay attention.  It amazes me.  Well, they have a lot of construction going on, so going home?  Yeah.  What the hell was that?  So, there's a lot of, you know, abrupt stops that happen.  Yeah.  It's nerve-wracking.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you got the four or five lanes going down to three or whatever it is. 
[00:13:00]  I forgot the exact thing.  You know, and they're trying to open up the whole thing to like five, four,  or five lanes.  So, they've got a massive construction project underway.  Yeah.  And you'll be flying along, and next thing you know, you're jamming on your brakes like,  what the fuck?  And then everyone starts taking off again.  It's really, really strange.  So, that happened over the weekend, huh?  Yeah.  What was that?  Thursday or Friday?  Remember Thursday? 
[00:13:30]  Thursday night, maybe early Friday morning.  They're supposed to be in North Carolina and do a bunch of gigs.  Artie's getting all this stuff, too.  It's really, I mean, it's always, you know, like, he's opening for Chris Rock in places.  Chris loves him, and, you know, it just stinks, man.  I'm sure.  I hope he's up and about soon.  Right.  I thought you would know more.  No, I was wished I did.  I mean, I went to the cellar that night, and the next night.  I meant to text you yesterday.  I was going to see if you knew anything.  No.  And I wish I did, you know.  Especially for Artie.  Artie is a really funny comic. 
[00:14:00]  You know, these news reports are all over the place, and they're not even mentioning Artie.  No.  No, that'll happen.  Yeah.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, Tracy obviously is a big star, so.  So, that's that, then.  That's that.  That's that, then.  The depressing, sad news.  Yeah.  Could be worse, though.  Oh, yeah.  Could be a lot fucking worse news.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  So, maybe we'll get more updates today.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  How about them Rangers?  Yeah, you're a big hockey fan, I see, now.  Huge.  Uh, was I trolling?  Were you trolling, or, because I was a little confused, too.  I read a few of your tweets.  Were you trolling, but actually getting sucked in and enjoying a really good hockey game?  I was, yeah.  There's nothing better than playoff hockey.  Who wouldn't enjoy watching, like, a really good hockey game?  Right.  And, uh, and that was, uh, there was some action. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  That was pretty fucking good.  But as far as, you know, some of the other tweets, people really take them seriously.  Of course they do.  It's their team.  They really take them seriously and get all pissy and mad.  I love it.  Yeah, they get, they have passion for their hockey team.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just like, you know, yeah.  I told you the Kings would win.  Oh.  I told you.  It's looking pretty damn good.  Yeah, but it's one of those situations where it was like, you know, fucking double overtime. 
[00:15:30]  Two overtime games.  Anyone could.  And there was action by both nets there.  That was crazy.  Right.  And then if you want to, you know, talk about, uh, the goalie having to share some fucking  real estate while the puck goes in, that was a weird little call there.  Never would have went to overtime, but you can't play that game.  I like the one tweet.  Someone, uh, what did they tweet?  They said something like, uh, oh, the better team won.  Yeah.  And your tweet was like, well, actually it could have went either way.  Could have went either way. 
[00:16:00]  The entire game.  I know.  The better team, I guess technically the better team in quotes won.  But that's a game that anyone could have, you know, either team could have, well, that's,  that sounds stupid, but you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Could have easily just been the Rangers.  Anytime.  During that overtime, I mean, it was insane.  Did they win or lose?  I really don't know.  They lost.  Yeah.  It was insane.  I mean.  They're down two games to Zippo.  So close with so many shots.  Right. 
[00:16:30]  But, uh, and just like I said.  Action packed.  Really fun to watch.  Very, uh, very cool.  I'll, I'll, I'll be watching when they bring it back to the garden.  When is that?  Tonight?  I think so, right?  So let's get tickets.  Yeah.  Don't we got hockey here at SiriusXM?  How about you give us some tickets?  Yeah.  I'll go to that game in a second.  Hell yeah.  I just got a tweet from somebody.  They said the femur is a bad one to break because there's lots of complications from clots and  infections.  So it's probably, it's just a long recovery. 
[00:17:00]  They said he's going to be in the hospital for several weeks.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  They're saying that.  You know what I mean?  That's good.  Yeah.  Because for a while you're like, well, what the hell?  Is he going to make it?  You know, it seems like people are starting to think, okay, he's going to make it, but  it's going to be several weeks in the hospital.  So in a weird way, I was happy to hear that because I'm like, okay, that means they feel  like they got control of this situation.  So, I don't know.  Did you go triple crown, Ant?  Did you go triple crown? 
[00:17:30]  Well, I bet, but I bet against the triple crown winner.  The California crown?  The triple crown contender.  Yeah.  California crown.  Who's just now, is just now another horse.  Just another horse.  I bet.  Another two out of three horse.  That's another two out of three horse.  That's why it's so amazing when they actually do it.  Name three two out of three horses.  Oh my God.  Okay.  Exactly.  Oh my goodness.  Only the hardcore horse racing fans could do that. 
[00:18:00]  Most of us could not name three, two out of three horses.  So California chrome is in that category.  I'll remember the name California chrome for another, I think I'll remember for maybe two  more months.  Maybe.  Ask me in the fall and I'm going to probably not remember the name California chrome.  And then just gone.  Right.  And then just gone.  And then what?  The, uh, the owner of California chrome turns out to be just an asshole.  Oh, it was great.  No, he turned out to be a guy, a real person. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, you got a real guy.  He's ragging about the fucking, uh, the, the way they run the, the, uh, triple crown.  And, uh, and, and, and then his wife starts giving him some shit and he's like, I don't  care.  Just tells her, tells her.  You probably had a few in them.  Okay.  But people really assume, I don't know.  People really liked this owner came across, uh, pretty good.  And then with this little rant, people are starting to think he's an asshole. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Yeah.  But I mean, what's the deal?  Like, uh, the horse that one didn't run in the other two.  I know that much.  Uh-huh.  That's what it is.  He wants.  And this happens all the time, right?  Yeah.  And it's, and it's part of the rules.  You're allowed to do this.  So, and he knows this going into it, that there's probably a few horses in this race that didn't  run the other two.  Yeah.  Because that Belmont is a much different race, as we all know.  Yeah.  It's a much longer race.  It's a longer race.  That's what makes the triple crown so tough.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  But, um.  And didn't California Chrome come in like fourth or fifth?  Tied for fifth?  Tied for fourth.  Somewhere around there, right?  Yeah.  I think it's like.  So why is he bitching?  He wasn't even close.  They're actually tied for fourth, I think.  Something like that.  So what, the four horses ahead of him, were they horses that didn't run the other two  races?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think so.  All of them?  So there were a lot of horses?  Maybe not all of them.  I'm not sure.  Where's our horse people?  Yeah, we need a horse. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it was, um.  I bet on the nine horse.  Nine?  I bet nine, eleven, two.  The two being, you know, California Chrome for the triple.  Right.  And then I just bet the nine and eleven for the X-Acta, because I didn't, uh, I put the  triple, California Chrome completely out of the money.  Right.  And then I took those two horses, the nine and the eleven, and I just picked one and bet 
[00:20:30]  fifty dollars to win on it.  And it was the nine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I should have fucking went the other way.  So it boiled down, it was a fifty-fifty shot of me hitting the right horse to bet fifty  bucks on, and I fucked it up.  Wow.  Whoopsie.  So, can we hear the guy's rant?  Yeah, I like this.  Sam Roberts, here it is.  And all those with California Chrome.  Throughout it all, Steve, it's been an amazing ride.  What were your thoughts as they turned for home? 
[00:21:00]  Well, I thought he was gaining ground, but he didn't have it in him, apparently.  You know what?  He's been in three.  This is his third very big race.  These other horses, they always set them out.  They set them out and try to upset the Alpicard.  I'll never see, I'm sixty-one years old, and I'll never see, in my lifetime, I'll never  see another Triple Crown winner because of the way they do this.  It's not fair to these horses that have been in the game since day one.  It's his wife over his shoulder.  Look at it this way.  If you can't make enough points to get in the Kentucky Derby, you can't run in the 
[00:21:30]  other two races.  So, if you had your way, you would say you've got to run the Triple Crown, or you cannot  come up in the Belmont and be a fresh horse.  That's right.  It's all or nothing.  It's all or nothing.  Because this is not fair to these horses that have been running their guts out for these  people.  You don't care.  And for the people that believe in them.  Horses don't care.  For have somebody to come up like, this is a coward's way out, in my opinion.  This is a coward's way out.  Well, now the wife is hitting them.  So, you think they can run into your horse, and that was the plan, just like they have 
[00:22:00]  other potential triple ones.  Did you see the wife hit him in the back?  Hey.  Our horse had a target on his back.  Everybody else lays out one.  Or they won't run in the Kentucky Derby, or the Preakness.  They'll wait until the Belmont.  You know what?  If you've got a horse, run him in all three.  If you've got a horse that can...  That...  Carol...  She's sticking to it.  If you've got a horse that earns points to run in the Kentucky Derby, those 20 horses  that start in Kentucky are the only 20 eligible to run in all three races.  This is the coward's way out.  Steve, I know it's a tough loss. 
[00:22:30]  We hope to see him down the road.  The little naggy wife.  All right.  Shut up.  Of course, she's lost, and she's fucking telling him what to say.  She's jabbing him in the back.  She's jabbing him in the back to make him shut up.  Because obviously, you can see there, she's starting to get texts from people saying,  your husband's losing his mind there.  You know, rein him in.  Why rein him in?  And she's reading the text.  And then she pokes him, and he's like,  Carolin!  Is he still talking?  The CNN clip hasn't walked away.  There it is.  Yeah, this thing is everywhere.  To be honest, this is why she was trying to rein him in, though. 
[00:23:00]  This is why.  Yes.  That's going to be frustrating.  But it's something they've been doing for a while, where they only run the Belmont.  Yeah.  Because they feel like their horse has a real good chance of that race, and maybe not so  much with the other two races.  Right.  So why wouldn't you keep him fresh for the Belmont?  Is there more Sam, or is that it?  That's it.  That was it, pretty much?  That's great.  He was not happy.  Wow.  Yeah, he was not happy at all.  No. 
[00:23:30]  It ain't good for him.  But I like the fact that he thinks the horses give a fuck.  They don't.  They just want to stop running, I think.  Yeah.  And go rest.  Yeah.  Oh, tired?  Let me hang my big dick out and go to the bathroom.  That's all they think of after a race.  I think horses...  Obviously, horses like to run.  I don't think they like running in that situation.  Yeah.  They like the open plains.  Where no one's really around, and they can just kind of run around.  Yeah.  I don't think they want somebody on its back.  I think they just get used to having someone on their back. 
[00:24:00]  I don't think they want...  How many people?  At least 100,000, right?  Yeah.  At least 100,000 people screaming as they're running.  Inches away from other horses.  I don't think they want that.  Yeah, getting whipped with some midget on his back.  You can train them to kind of, you know, do that, I guess.  Yeah.  But he don't give a fuck.  They have no idea they won in the end.  You think they have any idea in their horse brains that something special happened? 
[00:24:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  You don't think anything?  None.  I don't think they know anything.  They're dumb.  They got a little fucking pea brain.  Most of it's just to run that massive fucking body.  Right.  And that's about it.  You know, they see an apple.  They go, ooh.  Ooh.  Why did horse racing become the thing?  You think our ancestors tried running everything and it just didn't work out?  Do you think? 
[00:25:00]  Maybe.  Like somewhere they're like, let's try giraffes.  Oh, this sucks.  No, giraffes aren't going to work.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's try zebras, maybe.  Goat racing.  Although in some of these other countries, they certainly still race a lot of other animals.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just thinking it was a tried and true thing.  We tried a lot of animals and finally the horse one was like, fuck, this is working pretty  good, man.  This ain't bad.  All right.  I like this. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say a high.  Ha.  A high, a high, a high, a high, a high.  David in Ohio.  What's up, David?  David?  My David.  Hey.  The guy the next day goes on Good Morning America and talks about how unfair it was.  He said it was like him at 6'2", playing basketball against a kid in a wheelchair.  Oh, he said that?  Yes, he did.  The next morning.  You know you can't say wheelchair on TV.  What?  You can if it fits, but that just didn't really fit there. 
[00:26:00]  No.  That doesn't really make much sense.  Not at all.  That's bullshit.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  It happens.  It does happen.  Let's say hi to Greg in Indianapolis.  It's time for California Crawl.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you guys should listen to the Bob Costas interview with the winner right after that.  He didn't miss a beat right after that.  Instead of saying congratulations on winning the Belmont, he said, I've got to ask you,  Steve Soso said, this is a coward's way at it. 
[00:26:30]  No, really.  Yeah.  I guess he has to do that, though.  But I was just reminded, didn't they kind of change the rules to even allow California  Chrome not to run, but to wear those strips?  Remember they had to make a ruling on that?  Yep.  To breathe right.  So that's an actual rule they have that they said, all right, we'll let it slide.  So what is this guy talking about?  It's not fair.  Yeah, yeah.  They gave him a little upper hand there.  A little bit.  If you could call it that, but they changed a rule. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  Is this the GMA thing?  Yeah, let's listen to this.  For joining us, you're aware, I am sure, about the uproar in the sports world and on social  media with people calling you a sore loser.  Do you regret what you had to say after the race?  Not only no, but hell no.  I do not regret it one bit.  It's the truth.  Good for him.  You stand by those words and your convictions.  But of course, we were watching this on live television. 
[00:27:30]  We could see your wife behind you.  She seemed to be a bit dismayed.  You had some interaction and exchange a few words with her as well.  How does she feel about it?  And are you in the doghouse with her?  No, she's still getting out of bed right now.  But I'm here at the park.  You know what?  I'm going to stand by what I said, simply because, you know, there are people that train their  horses to run in the Kentucky Derby, and they have to qualify. 
[00:28:00]  They have to get points to run in the Kentucky Derby.  You don't have to have points to run in the Preakness or the Belmont, but you have to nominate  your horse for the Triple Crown, and that means three.  Triple Crown, three.  You might compare this to a triathlon.  You know, you've got to swim, you've got to bicycle, and you've got to run.  If you don't make it in one, you're not going to do the other two.  So that's the way I look at this.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but just to clarify for our viewers who may not be up to speed on  this, essentially your beef is that the horse that won and beat your horse last night didn't 
[00:28:30]  run in one of the two races leading up to the Belmont, and you're saying that's basically  a violation of some sort of code.  Do you think that the rules should be changed, that in order to compete in Belmont, you've got  to run in both the Preakness and the Kentucky Derby?  Yes, I do.  I mean, think of it this way, okay?  It says Triple Crown.  You nominate your horse for the Triple Crown. 
[00:29:00]  That means three.  Even the Triple Crown Trophy has three points on it.  So when you earn enough points to run in the Kentucky Derby, those 20 horses that start  in the Kentucky Derby should be the only 20 allowed to run in the Preakness and the Belmont  for the Triple Crown.  These people, they nominate their horses for the Triple Crown, which means three.  Like Mr. Haney.  Yeah.  And then they hold out two.  He lost his horse, too.  And then come back and run one. 
[00:29:30]  That would be probably screaming cunt in the car on the way home.  If you can fucking poke me again, I'll kill you.  Oh, God, you think she got a doggy, too?  Did she ever.  There were three horses in this race.  Yeah, I think she got a doggy, too.  Oh, yeah.  California Crone.  That's funny.  Right on Curlin and General A-Rod.  If you ever.  That ran in the first race.  Do that again.  It don't matter.  We should have vetted this before.  Yeah, just an interview.  He's just babbling.  Yeah, he's just going off.  But any time you see the guy with the cowboy hat on being interviewed, I always sit there 
[00:30:00]  going, oh, here it comes.  Going to say something stupid.  I wonder if they'll change the rules.  No.  Wow.  They've been doing it this way forever.  I think they consider it like, you know.  It just seems like more, what, horse owners are taking advantage of that.  It fills up the feel.  Because if you have a really good horse, you're like, the Triple Crown's a thing.  So you probably, for many, many years, were like, I got to run him in the Kentucky.  Yeah.  But now they're finally starting to think, like, let's just hold him back, I guess. 
[00:30:30]  How many of those 20 horses from the Kentucky Derby actually make it to the Preakness or  the Belmont?  You could end up with a field of five horses then.  Oh, right.  Because you can't fill out the field with other horses.  And that fucks up everything as far as the betting goes.  Gotcha.  You know.  It's usually a third.  A third of the horses will usually make it.  You got cheeky.  You did.  You got coy.  Yeah, you did.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Sometimes in the middle of a lie, I get very cute. 
[00:31:00]  A little bit there.  Yeah, so I don't think you could do it that way.  Right.  He's got somewhat of a point.  You know, you get a horse that runs all three legs and has a chance of getting the Triple  Crown, you kind of want him racing against like horses that have been through it.  Sure.  Well, all right.  And the Tonys were on last night.  Who gives a fuck?  Oh, who won?  Do tell.  Was Wolverine hosting? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  Was he?  Did he do a little song and dance number?  Because that's always a little weird.  I'm just saying that's always a little weird watching the old Wolverine.  It's a little weird how effortless it is.  It's effortless for him.  It's a little strange to me.  Just, you know, doing a little two-step up there.  You would think Wolverine would be a little, you know, clunky on his feet.  Right.  A little clunky.  But not this Hugh Jackman, man.  It's effortless.  He's a natural up on a Broadway stage. 
[00:32:00]  It's so easy.  He's eating a cronut as he does it.  Oh, true.  Yes.  He's trying to eat that cronut.  Oh, boy.  Why didn't Hugh Jackman come into our show if he was in town for the Tonys?  He's probably practicing for the Tonys.  Rehearsing.  Don't say practicing.  You show biz lingo.  Sorry.  I'm not in the business.  Hold on.  Before we move on from the horse thing, this guy has some knowledge.  Mike on Long Island.  Go ahead.  You're the last call on this subject for today. 
[00:32:30]  I just was listening to you guys.  At the end of that interview, he says that only three horses ran in all three races.  Is that true?  Is that true?  Yeah.  He named all three horses also.  So only three.  Oh, right.  He did say that.  So what is his problem?  General A-Rod and two other ones.  So what was he expected?  Three horses to run in the Belmont?  Yeah.  He's just a sore loser.  He is a sore loser.  Yeah, he is.  Obviously.  So three horses.  Wait.  He didn't have to wear those strips. 
[00:33:00]  And he still complained.  That would have made the triple pretty easy to get.  Only three horses.  Is that...  One of you said it right.  I mean, if they don't have horses, how are you going to bet on three horses?  Dan said that.  Yeah.  You can't...  Yeah.  He would have won the triple.  So everything he was saying doesn't make sense.  No.  It sounds like...  It sounds like by the time you get to Belmont, there's a lot of...  There's not many horses that ran all three races. 
[00:33:30]  Well, there's not a lot of horses that run a mile and a half.  Right.  Yeah, that's the issue.  That's why it makes it so tough to get the triple crown.  What's the longest one?  The Belmont.  That's it.  By far.  Belmont's a long race.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  All right, Mikey.  Thank you.  You get a horse that loses the Kentucky Derby.  Why the fuck are you going to put him in the Preakness and in the Belmont after that?  You know?  Really.  You don't want to strain him, stress him out, make him run that hard. 
[00:34:00]  Because if you win one out of the three, that's pretty cool, too, no?  Yeah, but if you know your horse, I don't know, doesn't have a chance at the triple crown,  and you just put him in the first one for the triple crown, you can't force the guy to  then, now you have to race in the next two races.  Right.  You know, my horse, this guy's foot hurts.  Hoof.  It's a hoof.  I think you're pushing your horse.  It's a sin, man.  Wouldn't you just push your horse as much as possible?  Because in the end, you know, you could really make some money off it. 
[00:34:30]  Oh.  That's right.  And I'd beat it if it lost.  I don't know.  If you think he doesn't have it in him, to win that, though.  Is there a place you could go just to see these horses?  See them?  Sure.  Like, is there, can you go somewhere in a couple months from now and just see California  Chrome?  Just munching on some grass in the pasture?  Well, because they never run again, really.  No.  After the whole triple crown attempt, they're done, right?  Yeah, that's it.  Does California Chrome ever run another race?  No, I'm going to put him out to stud. 
[00:35:00]  But how does that work?  Do these horses go on to run a few other races after this?  Nah, that's it.  So that's it for him?  I think that's it.  Because his jizz is worth a lot of money.  Right.  So you don't want him fucking up his legs, so you've got to shoot him.  Right.  You want to start jacking that horse off.  Absolutely.  Getting the jizz.  Now the fun begins for the owner and the horse.  Almost as precious as the Nagel seed.  Damn.  Really?  I don't know about that.  Yes.  Horses like, well, I've got to take this with me. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I don't trust these things.  And you don't have to show a horse Simpsons figures to get his company.  Who knows this shit?  So it's a complete timing issue and you just developed this horse for one lousy year of running?  Well, I'm sure he ran some shit before that.  So what's the lifespan of one of these horses as far as racing goes? 
[00:36:00]  They're three-year-olds, so they're just a couple of years.  And that's it.  Yeah.  At most.  Wow.  I bet.  They should have a stable just to see these horses now.  I bet they do.  And there's California Chrome over there.  I bet you they have their little ranch with, you know, home of California Chrome.  You think?  Two out of three.  Two out of three.  Ain't bad, though.  Yeah.  Meatloaf said that, I think.  Yes, he did.  He did.  All right.  We're done with the Tonys. 
[00:36:30]  That was great.  Great coverage on the Tonys.  Well, who won best?  Jimmy.  I don't know who won best.  I don't think any of us have seen a Broadway show in a few years now.  What was best musical?  We always see one every once in a while, right?  I saw Jersey Boys.  Yeah.  That was good.  Did you see...  It was really good.  Did you see Hedwig and the Angry Inch?  That was so good.  Really?  Yeah, it was good.  I didn't see it.  Although, people are saying you've got to see the Carole King musical. 
[00:37:00]  Fabulous.  People are saying you've got to see that.  It's fabulous.  Did you see A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder?  Ooh, that sounds mysterious.  Twelfth Night, but they spell it with that F.  That Twelfth...  Twelfth...  The Twelfth Night.  Twelfth Night.  It's a night with an N or a K.  Oh.  That must be starring a black cast if it's Twelfth Night.  Twelfth Night.  What about the Bryan Cranston joint? 
[00:37:30]  He won.  He won.  What is that, All the Way?  It's about LBJ.  He plays LBJ.  And gets up there and I guess puts on a pretty good performance.  He kills Kennedy for meth.  Yes.  It's a really weird connection.  Amazing.  By the way, I knew somebody that wore a hat.  He has a weird hat.  I always thought, wow, that hat looks really stupid on him.  But then I realized after I finally saw Breaking Bad, this guy thinks he looks like Walter White.  Oh, no.  I was so embarrassed for that. 
[00:38:00]  That is embarrassing.  You don't look like Walter White.  Embarrassing.  And then there's some show called Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill.  That just sounds awful.  That sounds...  Sometimes just the title alone goes, I don't want to see that.  But if you're like one of those broads from Long Island...  We're all going to see whatever the name is.  Wednesdays on the Long Island Railroad used to scare the fuck out of me when we worked at  N.E.W.  Oh, yeah.  When I was training it.  Every stop... 
[00:38:30]  We're going to Broadway.  The matinee.  The matinee.  We're going to the matinee.  And they all had their hair done.  I went to the parlor just for this.  Their hair is starting to look like cotton candy.  Do you ever, Chesterfield?  Does every woman end up just looking like that?  Yes.  I saw a woman walking around.  Her hair looked like a hat.  She had spun it around her head because I guess it was thinning and it was gray and nasty. 
[00:39:00]  It looked like old wool.  And it was spun on her head like a hat.  Like a wool hat.  Looked like...  That's her hair.  Looked like what you find in a lint trap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She just popped it on her head.  It's terrible what happens to these poor ladies.  Especially through like Westbury.  Oh, yeah.  I wore my mink.  And now that it's warmer, you're going to start seeing more of the Red Hat Society. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, I love the Red Hat Society.  Yeah.  There's some old broads that belong to the Red Hat Society.  Do they wear red hats?  You think any of them les out?  No.  Why not?  Why not?  Because the hat's the only red shit they've seen in years.  They have no sexual fucking...  None of these ladies would talk about where they were going to eat before their show.  Yeah.  And all the deals that they found online. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yes.  And they all know each other.  Like, the train stops and more come on and they know each other because they have it all planned ahead of time.  What train car they're going to be on for the big trip to the city.  It was Wednesdays, right?  Because I think that was matinee day.  Yeah.  Yep.  Wednesdays and matinee days.  They came in.  They would just take over the fucking train.  That's great.  Anyway.  To some lousy show.  What about...  Did Rocky win anything? 
[00:40:30]  Is that even open yet?  Yeah.  It's been open.  I don't know.  No buzz about it.  Did it win anything?  Do they sing?  Oh, does Rocky sing in that?  Yeah.  The list says, best scenic design of a musical.  And who knows what that means.  It stinks on ice.  What's one song from that new one?  Yeah.  I wish Mickey were here.  I'm sure it's something stupid like that.  To guide me through this year. 
[00:41:00]  Yuck.  I dropped a stewed tomato on the floor.  What are some of the songs that are Rocky I would love to know?  You got any Rocky from Rocky in the Musical?  These are always douchey.  They don't have any little samples.  They got to have samples online.  Something like that.  Young Sam Roberts is looking intently online.  I bet you one song is called Yo Adrian. 
[00:41:30]  Yo Adrian.  Ugh.  Oh, that sucks.  Yo Adrian.  And the bad, like, the dance troupe behind him comes out with boxing gloves on, like swinging.  And ship robes.  Yes, yes.  We're here to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.  I'll beat you.  Oh, is that some right there?  Yeah.  All right.  Can we do it after the break?  Because this might take a while.  As long as we get to it right away.  As soon as we come back. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to go in there and kiss E-Rock and then we come back.  Get distracted.  All right.  Simpsons.  And I want to talk about the most ridiculous show I've seen in years.  Ooh.  That was on over the weekend.  Well, I'm trying to think.  I was turned on by one of our guests that was in recently.  And I said, I remember this guy talking about this.  I'm going to take a look.  Check it out.  Oh, my God.  That's all I want to say right now.  Did you see any TV on what night was it?  Saturday night.  Saturday.  No.  Okay. 
[00:42:30]  You would have.  No.  This thing is so silly.  I'll explain next.  But first, we will do Rocky right after the break.  That's right.  So, Rocky.  We found some Rocky.  Yes.  Some musical.  The Tonys, I guess, were last night.  Notice I said, guess.  Yeah.  You're like, I don't know.  I heard something about, what is that?  Broadway.  They all have that song where they all come out in the robes and the box gloves.  They're singing that song.  I'm punching my way to your heart. 
[00:43:00]  I bet it's like that.  You don't like that?  I hate it.  When they all come out in little hats to sing.  I don't sweat you.  He don't sweat you.  He don't sweat you.  I don't sweat you.  Why would they just take that part?  I don't know.  Make a big song and dance number about it.  They all throw turkeys to imagine.  They all mock throw turkeys to windows and they harry them.  All over the top acting.  That Broadway acting.  Hey, Rock! 
[00:43:30]  Comes into the fucking meat locker and he's punching the meat.  I'm punching meat.  Yeah.  I'm going to go all the way to the top.  Going to go all the way to the top.  He's going to go all the way to the top, I think.  He's hitting the fucking meat.  Let's hear a song.  A real song.  Let's hear a Rocky song.  Please.  What's this one called?  This is an original.  I'm having my lip fixed by surgery.  This is Fight from the Heat.  Fight from the... 
[00:44:00]  Fight from the Heat.  What the fuck did you find?  To let him start. 
[00:44:30]  Is he Russian or something?  It's nice taking his time.  Rocky Marciano.  Oh, no.  If you was here, Rocky, what would you tell me to do?  Oh, gosh.  You've been in this corner. 
[00:45:00]  I'm not comparing myself to a champ such as you.  But, Rocky, you've been through it.  Oh, thank God.  Making the choice of your life in a second or two.  I've still got enough pride in me left.  I can still turn this down.  Here stands a fighter, but they want a clown. 
[00:45:30]  But now what I'm hearing, make a new start.  Rocky, fight from the heart.  Rocky, fight from the heart.  Thank God.  I've never a mount.  And always believe in their right.  All right, you got another one?  Like a big ensemble number?  All my life I've been down for the count.  Up until tonight.  Down for the count.  That's what Mrs. Dracula used to do.  I'll eat. 
[00:46:00]  She was sucking his penis.  Yes.  Is that it?  I got Eye of the Tiger.  Oh, let's hear it with that.  Yeah, sure.  What they did to that for Broadway.  What was this?  It must have been a preview.  A preview, huh?  Yeah, why isn't he speaking English? 
[00:46:30]  English-German.  You know, he sings fucking perfect English.  Maybe they're in Germany.  Das Musical.  It says Rocky, Das Musical.  Oh, so this is not the...  It's the same cast?  No, this is probably the guy who's...  Get under the glass table.  Open your mouth.  But this isn't like what you would hear on Broadway.  It's got guitars and shit.  Well, he's previewing the songs.  This isn't clips from the play.  Yeah, but not with the big orchestra and everything. 
[00:47:00]  Rocky!  Rocky!  You know, that shit.  Like a good musical, Sam?  I do.  Yeah, he liked Cats.  I love Cats.  Did you?  Rising up.  Oh.  Back on the street.  Oh, God.  What do you do?  Did my time.  Took my chances.  Chance Hills.  Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet.  He's just singing a bad cover of Rye the Tiger. 
[00:47:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  All right.  Too many times.  I've lost complete interest.  Let's see some more Rocky.  I've just lost complete interest.  Let's see the next one.  In this Rocky thing.  Come on, we've got to go into Rocky.  What would you do?  I know.  I would hope.  All right, this is the first look.  Oh, yeah.  All right, that's better.  That's more likely.  Oh, look.  It's pretty much like my life not being recognized, not having love in my life, just feeling very  alone and isolated. 
[00:48:00]  So I thought, why don't I take those feelings and put them in the body of a boxer?  And I had no idea that there's so many millions of people that felt the same way.  Sly makes any money with this or is he selling it?  This is a star we hear.  Yes.  But I'm hearing your voice in my head saying, don't let this go.  I'm sure he makes money.  Rocky's the story of the underdog, the person who always wanted somebody.  Is it Alex?  It's mysterious.  And never quite was able to achieve that and then gets a second chance in life. 
[00:48:30]  Make a new star.  Stop.  Rocky fight from the heart.  Oh, no.  Here are characters with tremendous heart, tremendous emotion.  Is it Link?  Who yearn to find one another and to find love and to redeem themselves.  Oh.  Something like true, something like warm, something like being sheltered from a storm.  Oh, that dumb boy, I hate it. 
[00:49:00]  What Rocky's able to achieve when no one believes in him is, you know, a global idea that many  of us can do what we dream of if we set our mind.  I love the sets.  What I liked about Rocky is he's just a kind guy.  He's not the biggest.  He's not the fastest.  He's not the strongest, but his pride is so explosive.  Sly just looks bizarre now.  Yeah.  Those eyebrows.  His face is half frozen.  It's quite a wonderful romantic story.  Did you get that work done?  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[00:49:30]  The fight was not the most important part.  The part was the heart.  It's a story that can go on from generation to generation about how everyone is entitled  to a moment of dignity.  Fight from the heart.  Oh, they do.  I'm in the meat locker.  Oh, boy.  I want to hear that one.  We should go.  Oh, boy.  Let's go see Rocky.  The music.  Yeah.  Yeah, we should.  Oh, boy.  Then we'll go see Wicked. 
[00:50:00]  And then Kinky Boots.  Then we'll go to a diner and get some food.  And then back to the trade.  So it didn't win much?  I don't know.  Who knows?  Who the fuck knows?  It has a fucking boxing ring and a musical.  They performed a number from it.  Well, I saw a singing show over the weekend.  You did.  Thanks to our pal, Sebastian Bach, who was in the studio.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  I was wondering who you meant.  He's part of a show called, I think it's called Sing Your Face Off.  Yeah.  Basically, they take celebrities.  Jimmy, look.  Sorry.  Oh, they're all boxing.  It's the whole thing.  That's what he was saying.  It was the whole thing.  They're all in my hood.  But you notice they're a little.  Yeah, yeah.  A little off.  A little mysterious.  I think you can say a little swishy.  Just a little swishy.  I want to be in the crowd because then they walk through the crowd.  Maybe they'll bring me on.  Maybe.  Is this from the Tonys last night?  Yeah.  Oh, yuck. 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  How you doing, radio?  How you doing?  Oh.  Oh, they bring out what, I guess it's Apollo Creed.  Hey, Creed.  That ring looks a little thin.  That final round of one of the greatest fans in the history of the sport of boxing.  It's unbelievable.  Both men are struggling to stand their feet.  They're doing like musical fake boxing.  I'm seeing it.  It's really. 
[00:51:30]  How do they fight with the ring spinning around?  Why would they?  No, that's symbolic.  Oh.  Yeah.  Why don't you just beat the shit out of the other guys just because it's on live TV?  Oh, look.  They're getting bloody.  Right.  Fuck me, Mick.  Fuck me, Mick.  This is so bad.  This is the thing last night?  Yeah.  Yes.  Silly.  He continues to shake them off and battle by challenging the dance punch and blow for blow. 
[00:52:00]  Have you ever seen anything like it?  Oh.  Oh, man.  It's over.  The fight is over.  What is that?  How douchey.  That's douchey.  Adrian!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  He's making out with Adrian.  Play a singing breath.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I like playing the pullovers from the audience.  All right.  Da-da-da. 
[00:52:30]  Da-da-da.  Stay tuned for the next 10 hours of the Tonys at the Winter Garden Theater.  Where's that?  Was it?  Rocky is.  Oh, that's right.  Now and forever.  Is that close?  Where are Caroline?  Yeah, it's right there.  All right.  Let's go see Rocky.  Where Mama Mia was.  Let's say hi to Ed in Vermont.  Ed.  Ed?  Hello, Ed.  Hey, good morning.  How you guys doing?  Would you like to know?  Yeah.  Yeah, you could be getting the best part of the play.  It's right at the end of the first act when they have 50 retarded guys come out on the  stage tap dancing to take me to the zoo. 
[00:53:00]  I was believing with what he said.  I know.  Well, that was a part of the movie.  Nice.  Take her to the zoo, Rock.  I hear the retards like the zoo.  So.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Good call.  Yeah.  So the show, Sing Your Face Off.  Sing Your Face Off.  So you get a bunch of celebrities and then they spin this like wheel.  Uh-huh.  Like you see on Let's Make a Deal.  Sure.  And then a face pops up and they have to like transform into that person. 
[00:53:30]  Oh.  Like physically?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  And you got Sebastian Bach on the show and who else is on this?  That Lisa Rinna.  Is that her name?  Lisa Rinna.  Uh-huh.  She's on that show.  And did they have to do it or are they like judges?  Yeah.  Yeah, they have to do it.  Oh, the celebrities.  The judges are Daryl Hammond and Debbie Gibson.  Wow.  And then like a special guest, guest judge.  Right. 
[00:54:00]  I saw Richard Simmons with his bizarre hair.  I don't know what the fuck he's doing now.  I think he's spraying some paint in there.  It's a whisper.  Yeah, but I think there's paint underneath.  Is there?  I think so.  His hair is like fucking Kaiser Sose.  You just talk of it and it's gone.  It's called Sing Your Face Off?  Yes.  And John Lovitz is on?  Really?  Yeah.  I think so.  The cast is John Lovitz, Sebastian Bach.  Right. 
[00:54:30]  Chyna Ann McClain.  I don't know who she is.  I don't know who that is.  Landry Fields, basketball player.  Right.  And Lisa Rinna.  And Lisa Rinna had to be Katy Perry.  And we're so uncomfortable to watch.  Oh.  The judges are Debbie Gibson and Daryl Hammond.  Right.  And then each week there's a guest judge.  Yeah, I said all that.  David Allen Greer.  Debbie Gibson cute.  She is.  Yeah.  She was in here.  I know.  Yeah.  She was flirting with us.  Her and Tiffany were in here flirting with us. 
[00:55:00]  We felt like we might have had a shot.  Have a shot?  Had a little shot at those two.  You missed the Carney Wilson episode?  I saw the Carney Wilson episode.  Oh, thank God.  I did see the Carney Wilson episode.  So.  And, oh, is this the one?  Landry Fields?  Landry Fields.  He's a basketball player.  He's a giant.  He's got to be at least 6'4", 6'5".  Uh-huh.  He's taller than Sebastian Bach.  And he spun the wheel and it landed on Nicki Minaj.  What?  The guy could get a girl's phone?  Yeah.  Wow, that's kind of crazy.  And they've got to spend a week, you know, becoming the person. 
[00:55:30]  It's a really dumb show.  It sounds it.  I don't want to sell this as something that's amazing that we all should watch.  It sounds stupid.  It's a dumb show.  Elisa Renna had to be Justin Bieber on the episode I saw on Saturday.  Now, will they use blackface or whiteface when you have to change race?  Well, it seems like the black girl on the show has gotten all black.  But if it's spinning the wheel, they're avoiding it.  I think they're avoiding some problems is what I'm saying. 
[00:56:00]  I hear you.  Because she was Michael Jackson.  She was, who's the one where her butt is like spreading out on the piano bench?  That's Alicia Keys.  Alicia Keys.  Rihanna.  And next week, I think she's going to be, I think she's going to be James Brown.  Wait, so it's the same celebrities every week?  Yeah, they get voted off because that's what you do.  Oh, okay.  Now I get it.  Sebastian Bach, he had to be Willie Nelson.  He had to be Freddie Mercury.  Uh-huh. 
[00:56:30]  And then John Lovitz is kind of getting the fat ones.  Uh-huh.  He had to be Meatloaf.  So I just want to show you this clip of Landry, the basketball player.  He's like 6'4", 6'5".  He had to be Nicki Minaj.  This is going to freak you out.  All right.  Landry Fields sings his face off as Nicki Minaj.  Yeah, look at this, lasers.  Look at this giant.  Big production. 
[00:57:00]  It's not Nicki.  It's not.  Huh?  Let's go to the beach.  Eat.  Let's go get away.  They say what they're going to say.  Have a drink.  Drink.  Found my own life.  Bad girl like me.  It's hot to come by.  This is what Japanese did.  Let's go get it on.  So, oh.  That's what you see in a drag club.  Yes.  I've heard. 
[00:57:30]  He's dressed like a serial killer or something.  Did you fuck me?  I fucked me hard.  The reaction says it all.  He's got a giant fake butt.  Yeah.  Horrible pink hair.  Delightful.  This is terrible.  Thank you.  That's why I brought it to you. 
[00:58:00]  That was terrible.  Let's stop.  Let's do this one last time.  Let's stop.  We're higher than a Richard Simmons.  Oh, now he's twerking.  I don't like the reaction shots of judges.  Yeah.  They're shocked.  Well, there's a whole thing with Richard Simmons because, you know, he might like that sort of thing.  Mysterious.  I'm higher than a Richard Simmons.  And there's Sebastian Bach as Freddie Mercury. 
[00:58:30]  You're already singing.  Oh, how was that?  It was pretty good.  Fucking Sebastian Bach knows how to fucking sing.  I want to see him as Freddie Mercury.  Let's see him as Freddie Mercury.  Where is he?  You got to play Richard Simmons because he's...  Oh, he's mysterious.  And he likes to be a little over the top, I think.  He certainly does.  Yeah, play this.  Let's see.  He's just staring in awe.  He can't imagine.  That's the end of the show.  That was it.  They don't give you the Richard Simmons going over the top.  No, they don't give you the judges.  All right.  I do want to see...  Entering the facelift now. 
[00:59:00]  Got Freddie Mercury.  Let's see.  Sebastian Bach has a pretty good voice.  He's got an amazing voice.  His Willie Nelson wasn't that great.  Yeah, he doesn't have that kind of voice.  No, so he kind of made it his own, which goes against the show.  Hell.  I guess you don't have it.  Episode two.  Do you even know what episode?  I think it was episode three, I think. 
[00:59:30]  They don't have all the clips.  Last week, the Face Finder handed out five new musical challenges.  The Face Finder.  Five famous faces transformed into five music legends.  Oh, boy.  Canadian John Lovitz tonight is...  No, no, this wasn't the episode.  Oh.  No, it wasn't the episode.  Uh, try a three.  I think it might have been three.  All right.  Let's go with...  There we go. 
[01:00:00]  Let's go with three.  What the fuck?  No, it was episode four, I just realized.  It was going to be episode four.  All right.  I just did some figuring out in my own head.  All right, episode four.  But they don't have the clip.  So this is going to be a waste of time.  Well, they had the full episode.  Oh.  Oh, do they?  Oh, do they now?  Oh, do they now?  What the hell's that?  Got to put in my thing.  It was a photo of two compassionate people.  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, do you okay, Grandma?  You're joking on your words.  I tell a little joke and then I just have to relax in my chair for a half hour.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Sing your face off.  Oh, it's a...  Just sounds terrible.  It's...  Tonight, comedian John Lovitz is Meat Loaf.  Meat Loaf.  Actress Lisa Renna becomes Justin Bieber.  I need to be older. 
[01:01:00]  Disney Channel star Chyna Ann McClain is Alicia Keys.  Rock legend Sebastian Bach is Freddie Mercury.  All right, there you go.  Star Landry Fields transforms...  Random records to Broadway.  Give it up for Debbie Gibson.  No.  Keep going.  Keep going.  And twice the pressure.  Sebastian Bach goes first, so...  Freddie Mercury is just, to me, like, so iconic way he performs.  I ended up watching Queen videos after this.  I'm actually not scared of the choreography.  You forget how much of a performer Freddie Mercury was. 
[01:01:30]  What a performer.  That whole Radio Gaga at Wembley.  Nobody wants to be a loser.  Wembley.  I don't love that song.  Huh?  I don't love that song.  But everyone clapping along.  Over 100,000 people clapping along at once.  Sebastian Bach sings the space off as...  So those people have to wait for them to get into the elevator all this time?  No.  Oh, is that pre-shot?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's a big lost answer.  It's Fat Freddy.  It's Fat Freddy. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I've taken my bows and my cuts and calls.  You've brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it.  I thank you all.  It's so weird to hear that voice coming out of this face.  Roses and no pleasure cruise.  I consider it a challenge for the whole human race.  And I ain't gonna lose.  We are the champions, my friends. 
[01:02:30]  Wait.  So a singer is competing against actors in a singing contest?  I know.  That is true.  That is true.  It's a voice.  This is a fucking...  I'm sure John Lovitz can hit those notes to find out it.  We are the champions.  He doesn't have to tame one line, one note down.  No.  We are the champions. 
[01:03:00]  We are the champions of the world.  Yeah, he's...  Nail it.  Totally.  That's so unfair.  It really is.  Yeah.  You should be able to throw cherry bombs at the real singers when they have to do it.  Because there's no more actor can compete with that.  He is fucking up.  Yeah, yeah.  That was awesome.  Some basketball player in drag.  Yeah, the basketball player is going to get up there and...  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  First off, Sebastian, give me a big old smile with those teeth. 
[01:03:30]  Hi.  They made him wear fake teeth to sing with, too.  Anything to fucking make the odds better.  It wasn't really that difficult to sing with the teeth in your mouth.  Yeah.  This is boring as fuck.  Yeah.  I feel like Sean Connery taking out Catherine Jetta Jones.  Let's hear what the professionals thought about your performance.  All right.  Can you do a Sean Connery?  Oh, remember.  That was flawless.  I'm not proposing marriage. 
[01:04:00]  You don't have to think about it.  Just nod.  That's the easy one.  Awesome.  He goes awesome.  Awesome.  Doesn't have a clue.  Lovitz is doing very well on the show.  Oh, is he?  Lovitz is a funny guy, man.  Yeah.  John Lovitz is fucking funny.  He did Billy Idol, Pavarotti.  And Meat Loaf.  And the Meat Loaf.  So he gets the fat people.  Well, you can see him as Meat Loaf quick if you want.  God.  Oh, my.  They put horrible notes on it. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, did they fuck him up?  It's a really dumb show.  It is so bad.  I like the theatrics.  It's very...  It's well produced, buddy.  Very huge.  That's not bad, actually.  Maybe they only picked these actors who could actually sing a little bit.  Maybe. 
[01:05:00]  It's got a little singing background, probably.  And I won't do that.  Oh, boy.  Some days that don't come easy.  He looks ridiculous doing that.  Yeah, he does look really silly.  Some days that don't come at all.  And these are the days that never end.  As long as the planets are turning.  As long as the stars are burning.  As long as the dreams are coming true. 
[01:05:30]  You better believe it.  That I would do anything for the love.  It's John Lovitz, though.  That I would do anything for the love.  How did this get picked up?  It's on a Saturday night.  And they only did...  Against Stanley Cup hockey, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  They recorded six episodes, and they're airing them back-to-back each week.  Yeah, committed to three weeks of Saturday nights for it.  Yeah, I saw it two episodes in a row. 
[01:06:00]  Man, that's great.  Anyway.  Congrats.  People were getting mad at my house.  Because I was...  I...  Because I was enjoying this.  I would be mad.  I was enjoying it because it's so stupid.  Yeah.  It is bad.  I like stupid shit.  That's a hell of a show.  That's a good one.  I can't imagine it's doing well. 
[01:06:30]  I haven't heard anyone else talk about this.  No.  You've had some great challenges over the series.  And then they just have to sit there for the rest of the show in the dumb outfit.  In the seat.  In the outfit.  Yeah, like it's Halloween.  Oh, goofy.  You think Sebastian Bach wants to sit around in that stupid mustache all day?  Hey, man, Sebastian Bach was in.  So I figured, fuck, I'll kind of check it out.  He got voted off, by the way.  Sebastian?  What?  Why?  No, he didn't.  I feel like...  I don't think anyone's going to actually watch this show.  So I feel...  What did he get voted off? 
[01:07:00]  I feel okay with the fact that I just spoiled...  He's the first that was voted off.  Get the fuck out of me.  What was it based on?  You know what I mean?  It's just he's too good.  It's like it's...  I don't know.  What, did he kick a judge?  I don't know.  I guess...  I guess...  I don't know.  The point totals are for every week.  He was better than John Lovitz, though.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, but...  What are you judging it on?  I guess he had shittier performances before that.  His Willie Nelson wasn't that good.  Why do I care?  Huh?  Why do I even care?  It's a terrible show. 
[01:07:30]  But Sebastian got voted off.  How?  Well, that I care about.  Yeah.  So now I'm not watching it anymore.  That's it?  You're done?  Yeah.  You don't want to see what John Lovitz has to sing?  Yeah, it's just a goof.  A goof!  If they don't run out of fat singers before John Lovitz gets voted off.  That's a good point.  I'm being reminded that they did a diving show with Louie Anderson, so of course they  did the show.  Oh, right.  The show was dope, though.  Oh, it was.  This was ABC, right?  ABC did the diving show? 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  So this is their diving show for this summer.  Jesus.  Except the diving show was on primetime during the weekend.  Crazy.  Yeah.  But wasn't there crying in that show?  Yeah.  Louie would always cry.  Louie was crying.  Going to the water.  He didn't cry.  He didn't think he could do it.  And I'm sitting there going, do what?  Jump into a pool?  Who was that?  Who was it?  Remember they couldn't get him out of the pool?  Oh, yeah.  Was it Kareem?  Kareem was Kareem.  Kareem that looked like he was going to break every fucking bone in his body.  Right.  Jumping into the water.  And they teased the Louie Anderson belly flop for weeks? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  For weeks.  I'm pitching a show, actually.  A celebrity show.  I've already kind of trademarked it.  Uh-huh.  Celebrity genital mutilation.  That's fantastic.  So celebrities get up, have their genitals mutilated, and then what's the point?  Yeah.  How do you get voted off?  Whoever's genitals are mutilated in the most amusing fashion.  Oh, all right.  Okay.  Well, it's just a mutilator.  They're a team.  You want to see old Lisa Renna?  Yeah.  Act like Katy Perry and everyone saying how she's, like, ageless? 
[01:09:00]  Oh, no.  Do you want to see it?  It's up to you.  They say she's ageless, though.  Uh-huh.  As she does Katy Perry.  That's her doing Justin Bieber.  Oh, good.  Does she drop end bombs like Justin?  I don't know.  What's the latest on?  No.  He's baptized.  He was really baptized in a bathtub?  That doesn't seem like it's legit.  So silly.  That's what they got to do now?  Well, I mean.  Wait.  They baptized him because he used the N-word? 
[01:09:30]  I don't know.  That's what the headline's saying.  Holy shit.  Bieber baptized in a bathtub after he was caught using N-word.  Bad boy Justin Bieber is born again.  The boyfriend, Krooner, cleaned his soul with a bathtub baptism at a Manhattan church last  week after a new video was released of the pop star slinging the N-word.  Five years ago.  Bieber sought atonement at the church after a week of rigorous Bible study.  Oh, my God.  And they write this like it's real shit. 
[01:10:00]  This is unbelievable.  We're all living in a play.  Yes.  There's not an ounce of sincerity in any of this.  This is weird.  The fucking song, My Nigga, My Nigga.  How fucking popular is that song?  It's huge.  YG.  Are they apologizing?  Are people attacking them?  It's like, what a fucking nonsense.  It's My Hitta.  My Hitta.  My Hitta.  Yeah.  My Hitta.  Which one you got?  The Rocks?  I love this one.  You better have the original.  Oh, no.  All the titles are censored in this system.  They censored titles.  Hold on.  Stop.  We'll know in a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Stop. 
[01:10:30]  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  They actually censored the titles in the system?  Yeah.  The G's are replaced with asterisks.  So.  The G's?  The G's.  Oh, no.  It says N-I asterisks.  Asterisks?  So people that work.  That's so weird.  So people that work for Sirius XM will be offended if they see the actual song title?  Yes.  Because that's the actual song title.  See, if you see the word, it's just as offensive as hearing it, Opie.  Words hurt.  That's true.  Oh, my God.  Good point.  That is unbelievable.  Great point.  We are in the weirdest place. 
[01:11:00]  But the song is okay to push play on, but someone around here might get offended if they  see that song title in the system.  They know they could turn that volume down on their headphones and not have to hear that  offensive language.  We are a bunch of pussies.  Yeah.  They even have HIDTA with asterisks in the title, and I don't get that at all.  Why?  Why?  It's HIDTA.  H-Asterick-Asterick-T-A.  Nice.  So it's two different letters.  That's so weird.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:11:30]  That's so weird what's going on.  Well, HIDTA is a euphemism for niggas, so because, you know, you have to kind of continue  because you don't want people...  Who's overthinking this shit?  Well, trigger words.  Trigger words.  That's right.  Oh, you better asterisks over trigger.  How do you second this song, then?  So, Bieber sought atonement at the church after a week of rigorous Bible study.  Bible study?  His pastor, Carl Lentz, told TMZ.  The actual baptism took place in the church's bathroom and was performed by one of the pop 
[01:12:00]  star's pals.  This is crazy, man.  That's his PR team.  Although, that's really nobody demanding it of him.  That's just his PR team deciding to do that.  It's craziness, though.  It was reported in February that Bieber was scouting New York City churches with a private  pool to conduct a cleansing ritual.  He eventually settled on Hillsong Church's bathtub because it was private.  Justin is serious about his Christian faith, and after recent events, he needed to take  a pause.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  A whole bunch of lies. 
[01:12:30]  We're in a play.  Yeah.  That's just a whole bunch of lies I just read.  Jesus.  Anyway, you want to see Lisa Renna?  I want this to hurt.  I want you to suffer.  I want you to suffer.  Since Sam cued it up.  Don't blame me.  He's all cued it up.  I asked you.  We can move on.  Or do you want to see Lisa Renna?  I can't be blamed for this, but...  Is she truly ageless?  That's what I want to know.  They say she's ageless. 
[01:13:00]  Even though she has frozen face syndrome, too.  Oh, God.  And she does diaper commercials.  Right.  All right.  Go ahead.  The facelift now.  Lisa Renna sings her face off as...  Wow.  See, she goes up the other and comes right back.  It's amazing.  This is going to bother you.  Yeah.  I'm sure it will.  Ew. 
[01:13:30]  She's licking a lollipop, and she just licks.  She's too old to be licking lollipops.  We're still watching this horrible show.  She did a diaper commercial.  Oh, God.  She has good yoga arms.  What's the problem, man?  It's a little bizarre. 
[01:14:00]  It's like in Mommy Dearest when Joan Crawford had to do the part her daughter did in the soap opera.  Okay, yes.  Very good.  We don't have to watch the last thing, do we?  I was done on the elevator right up.  Yeah.  To the studio.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  So there you go. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  So another just silly competition show on TV for everybody.  That's bad.  That seems to be the latest thing.  Silly competition shows.  Yeah.  They're all just silly in the end.  Very seriously.  With celebrity, what, judges?  That's hot right now.  What about Sex Factor?  What's Sex Factor?  Oh, you don't know about Sex Factor.  Have you started watching Sex Factor?  I don't know if it's on yet.  I saw the tease for Sex Factor.  Sex Factor.  It's, uh, what's her, Bell Knox's new show? 
[01:15:00]  It's like X Factor, but you get to fuck at the end.  Oh, it's nice.  Is this on Nickelodeon?  Yeah.  What happened to her schooling?  I thought she was going back to Duke.  She likes this better.  It's just what she likes.  She's exploring her passion.  She is such a fucking hooah.  I have just seen her Twitter and clips that she posts, and it's just, she can't get enough  dicks in her.  She's a good girl.  She's all in.  She's a good girl.  She's all in with it.  I think she's saying, fuck Duke. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Literally.  She wants to fuck Duke.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see some of this.  The Sex Factor.  It's like the X Factor.  At the 2014 ABN Awards show in Las Vegas,  some of porn's biggest stars came together to create a reality competition called The Sex  Factor.  Eight guys and eight girls will compete for porn startup and a $1 million prize.  These 16 contestants have never been seen on film before.  Never been seen on film before. 
[01:16:00]  What, you don't think she's good at this?  I'm Belle Knox.  I'd rather watch this than a fucking, them competing for some, whatever they compete for.  Oh.  Getting fucked with you.  The competition is fierce, and we will make history become an industry.  It's a win-win, Belle.  It's kind of a very simple breakdown.  Yeah.  So I'm expecting a really good show.  Oh, a big dick.  If I weren't already in the industry, and I heard a big dick, I would have said,  this is my golden opportunity.  This is my ticket to go enjoy my life.  Ticket to what?  Stardom?  And do what I want to do, and make tons of money at the same time. 
[01:16:30]  You've got to be fearless to be in porn.  The first couple scenes are a little nerve-wracking, but I'm going to have these guys.  I'd be getting dogged from behind.  America.  Nothing like this has ever been done before.  Carrie and Lee's penis is insured for a million dollars.  New contestants have never stepped foot in front of the camera.  Draw your pants.  Get your cock on now.  Oh my God.  What pressure.  Get your cock on now.  We're going to decide who's got the sex factor.  So follow us on Twitter to vote and interact with the cast. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  You've got no knickers on your phone.  I know.  I have no underwear on.  You didn't tell me.  A little fun.  Performance a hell of a lot better.  Either you listen to what I say, or you pop your shit on a Viacra.  This is a parody.  No, no.  One of the things I'm most excited about is that I'm going to do a scene with the winners.  I'm going to do a scene with the winners.  Would you or someone you know would like to be in this competition and win a million dollars? 
[01:17:30]  Oh, they can't even find people yet.  They're trying to get contestants.  Maybe a guy that's cocky and arrogant like myself.  If you think they could be the next porn star, then have them contact us on the Twitter for love.  We want you.  We want you.  We want you.  We want you.  Man.  Do you have the sex factor?  What do you think?  I'm going to do it.  You're in?  I want to do it.  Jimmy, you in?  Yes, I am.  You should sign up for it.  Well, let's sign Jimmy up.  Let's sign Jimmy up.  Let's get Jimmy up.  Let's sign up for the sex factor. 
[01:18:00]  I want to be a part of it.  Guys, I'm here to make love.  Get your cock on.  Well, hold on.  I need conditions.  I need to play with my nipples and take the cameras out.  I'm going to lose my direction.  I'm going to get nervous.  You would think that was an SNL parody.  A little wacky.  A little wacky.  But they can't find contestants?  Not yet.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Mainly because most of the people who would agree to it could probably just be porn stars anyway. 
[01:18:30]  You'd be a porn star anyway.  And if you aren't yet, you don't want to destroy your life.  No.  You'd just be a porn star on the internet.  They're going to get so many people for this because people want to – there's no good way into the business anymore to make yourself a name.  Like, Bell Knox made a name for herself quick, but it's hard to make a fucking name anymore in porn.  It's like with all these video things, it's all like online shit and quick scenes.  This is a shot at getting in and making a real name for yourself in porn.  Well, sign up, Jimmy. 
[01:19:00]  Sure.  I should do it.  Let's get Jimmy signed up.  See if they pick him.  Get your –  Do you know how embarrassing I'd be twiddling my nipples in my appendix car trying to get an erection?  Twiddlylylylylylylylylyway  Are everybody yelled at me?  That fucking cock would panic.  We're losing the light.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'd be –  I'd literally be injecting liquid Sialis.  The mean judge would be making you bashful.  Yeah, the British one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's no sing your face off, Sam. 
[01:19:30]  You prefer sing your face off?  Yeah, yeah.  Sing your face off or fuck your come out?  I'll take fuck your come out.  That's the best reality show idea I've ever heard.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  They're competing for a spot in the house.  Who cares?  It's a shit.  This is great.  You get to fuck this girl if you win.  I'm in.  Just fuck.  I love that one chick was like,  well, I'm expecting big things because you have a really big cock.  Well, very good.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  That's a great idea for a show. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  100% behind it.  And then if you win, you get to fuck Phil Knox.  Correct.  I just didn't like the radio.  I didn't mind the promo, but I didn't like when they were like,  You didn't like when they stopped it and then rewound what she said?  I don't like that sound effect.  I hate that.  Yeah.  You don't like that?  No.  That'd be fun, though.  Get your fuck on with her.  Bet you got to use a rubber. 
[01:20:30]  Why don't they just test you?  That sucks.  Fucking rubbers my ass.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  What?  Kenny gave me an article.  Girth, not length, preferred for one night stands.  I've heard that, too.  Oh.  Oh.  I disappoint in two ways.  Yes.  Is Kenny giving you tips?  Yes.  Well, he knows I'm thin and small,  and I always tell him I hate girth and length.  He's showing me that I'm wrong.  I told you it wasn't just me.  Yeah.  I prefer a girthier cock buried in my colon. 
[01:21:00]  It helps me feel like I'm alive.  The pain helps me feel like I'm alive.  It's like chewing an aspirin.  Oh, God.  That's bad.  When we get back, what was the one thing?  Do you want to talk about fucking what happened in Florida?  What happened in Florida?  Fucking West Palm.  They announced my show July 10th, 11th, and 12th.  Nice.  Jimmy's first time there in five years.  Jimmy's back on the road.  And then tomorrow, Cobbs goes on sale for San Francisco for August 7th through 9th. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I'm just back on the road.  Back on the road.  Very cool.  There's a few things.  Oh, the Chris Daughtry clip I wanted to see after that, right?  Oh, that's good.  And I also want to talk about the mystery sea monster.  Okay.  That's freaking people out.  Is that real news, though?  The mystery sea monster?  Yeah.  Probably not.  I think it's real news.  And then the two that were looking for a cell phone and a toilet and what happened there.  Oh, the Chinese people?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  It's always some wacky Indian story or China.  And we got an update on Punty.  Oh.  Good old Punty.  Little Punty.  Right.  Lots to do.  Stay there.  I don't know.  That barbecue thing looked pretty good, though, over the weekend.  A lot of barbecues going on.  What do you mean?  Well, I saw a lot of Instagrams from the E-Rock and a lot of food.  You mean the consumer?  The consumer.  Hashtag.  Hashtag consumer.  E-Rock, you had a big barbecue over the weekend? 
[01:22:30]  No, you went to one.  I went to one.  Who's?  The Big Apple Barbecue Fest.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  I saw a picture.  Roland was there.  It was a big event.  I just would never do that.  What are you guys doing?  I'm not saying it's wrong or anything.  It wouldn't cross my mind to go to a barbecue fest.  It looks huge.  Yeah, but Roland was there Friday through Sunday.  Roland, you were there every day?  That's for the whole barbecue experience. 
[01:23:00]  Where was it?  At the Madison Square Park.  What was that?  Down on 23rd and Broadway.  By the clock.  The big clock is over there.  It's where Shake Shack is.  That park.  Yeah.  Madison Square Park, doesn't it have that weird white head in it?  That giant white head?  Some kind of sculpture?  They have a bunch of them now.  Really strange.  It's a strange park, I think.  Yeah, they have new sculptures every so often.  Yeah, all right.  What do you mean you're there for the whole experience?  What do you think of egg whites? 
[01:23:30]  Well, I had a little brisket.  A little pulled pork one day.  Then I went back and had some whole hog, a little bit more ribs, sausage that following  day.  Lots of drinks.  Lots of drinks?  Roland had lots of drinks.  Oh, yeah.  Heather B. was down there?  Oh, yeah.  Who?  Heather B.  Do you guys still think Dr. Ian Smith's an asshole?  You do, Lowns.  Huh?  Yeah, it was his fault for not sending the right stuff, right?  Yeah, exactly.  That is true.  Look at that.  You guys are down there. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Pam Martin's barbecue was delicious.  He gave me drinks.  Everything was delicious there.  Booze?  Oh, yeah.  Tons of booze.  Were there a lot of big people there?  I feel slender.  Wow.  Did you really?  Yeah, there's tons of big people.  Of course.  I wish I would have known that was happening.  That looks good.  I had to go down there and just yell at her buddy and say, do you complain about the  fucking airline states being too small?  You'd be a funny-duddy.  Yeah.  There's dead fucking, just whole big carcasses.  And my, um, Pam Martin's, he's known for the whole hogs. 
[01:24:30]  I helped them do the whole hogs.  Does anyone know?  Yeah, whole hogs.  He's saying, Pam Martin.  Pam Martin.  Whole hogs.  I'm saying that.  Pam Martin.  Pam Martin.  Pat Martin's.  Pat Martin's.  Is it Pat or Pat?  Pat.  Pat.  Martin's.  Martin's.  Pat Martin's.  Oh, hi, Pam Martin.  Oh, Pam Martin.  Oh, hi.  Cotton shoes.  It's a delicious whole hog.  So it's a full fucking pig and you throw it on a, wow.  Oh, my God.  Why are you putting baseball hats on? 
[01:25:00]  There's a fucking hat on it.  I don't want a hat on my lunch.  It's a hat on a pig head.  Well, they cut the head off.  Oh, that's the pig head.  Yes.  Someone already said it.  They said it was Iraq's selfie.  It's so bad.  I didn't get to say that at all.  It's so bad.  Yeah.  Why do they cut the snout off of the pig?  That's where all the germs are?  It burnt off.  What?  They did it.  It burnt off.  Oh, my God.  Poor pigs.  What a life. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, the Cuban was there.  He was all lit up.  It's a little lit up.  I love the Cuban.  Is this show going to go?  More Cuban?  He finds out this week.  The Angry, the Mad, what's his name?  Mad Cuban?  Yep.  Blueberry Cobbler Pepperidge Farm.  Pepperidge Farm.  That's what you tried?  Iraq gave a review of the Blueberry Cobbler.  Will you just stop trying to build a cottage industry out of your fucking eating habits?  A cottage industry. 
[01:26:00]  What do you have to say about the Blueberry Cobbler Pepperidge Farm cookies?  The review is so good.  All right, go ahead.  I can't see the review from here.  Do you mind if I read Iraq or would you like to?  Sure, go ahead.  Did you have to make them or you bought them like that?  Come on.  Everything is.  They're the edition, though.  Everything's pre-made and ready to go.  It's all prepared the same way.  New Pepperidge Farm Blueberry Cobbler Cookies.  This product proves that the blueberry really is a standalone fruit.  Oh.  Oh.  No need to mix with any other flavors. 
[01:26:30]  Not too sweet and a good natural blueberry taste with real...  With real...  With pieces of real blueberries baked in.  Worth the...  Worth the...  Worth the...  Worth...  Worth the...  Worth the try during its limited run.  During its limited run.  Hashtag the consumer.  Ew, you wrote worth the try?  You know what?  Jess... 
[01:27:00]  Ew, yes.  Oh!  Fair enough.  I deserve that.  Is this...  They're delicious.  You would like it if you'd stop hating food.  I'd love food.  That's a problem.  I love food.  I know.  But you would like this one.  I'm sure I would enjoy it.  Iraq, I want an honest answer.  Yes.  Is this a bit tongue-in-cheek?  No.  It's delicious.  No.  Tongue-in-cheek is...  It's everything else in cheek.  I'm talking about...  Pork, mustard, fucking...  Everything but egg whites in cheek.  I'm talking about the reviewing and all that. 
[01:27:30]  Is there a little tongue-in-cheek or you're like dead serious?  No, I like doing this.  That review was serious.  It's serious.  Even the part about worth the try?  During its limited run, that's the most serious part of all.  During its limited run.  And he means get out there and get some quick before these disappear.  Limited time.  But it's not limited time.  They're just trying it out.  If they do well, then it'll always be there for you.  Iraq, were the blueberries distributed throughout the entire cookie?  Yes, they were.  Did you break it apart and go to the chef and say...  Yeah, do you study the...  Do you have any idea how long that's going to take? 
[01:28:00]  Look, you're onto something now.  You've got to walk us through this.  You don't just bite into a cookie.  Do you break one apart to see if it's equally distributed?  He fucks two of them first.  Take us through the process.  Yes, please.  You open the bag.  All right.  You smell it.  To see if it smells really artificial, you know it's going to taste bad.  I wouldn't know what artificial smells like.  I swear.  What does artificial smell like?  Open up any of those flavored Oreos, and right away you know if they're going to taste bad. 
[01:28:30]  See, you should have a fucking video of something of you enjoying the bouquet.  You should make like a video series of you taking regular packaged consumer whatever food.  This should be a video.  This should be definitely like a two-minute video.  Right.  Two-minute video.  You rock.  I'm serious.  Okay.  I'm trying to help your cottage industry.  That's all. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  So then what?  You smell for the artificial taste.  Then you take a couple out of the bag.  You get the feel of it.  The feel.  Yeah.  Sometimes you ever get a cookie that's just so solid, like you could bang it on the table  and it's not breaking?  Yeah.  You don't want that.  No, never.  You want some softness, but not too soft, because you don't want the whole thing to fall  apart in your hand, right?  Well, these are a little too soft.  They do crumble as you pick it up.  That's the way the cookie crumbles.  How many are broken in the bag?  I should point that. 
[01:29:30]  How many are broken in the bag?  Because that's always a drag, too.  None were broken in the bag.  Wow.  At least in this one.  I'm sure others may be.  All right.  All right.  Then you are.  Added value.  Then what do you do?  And then you taste the goodness.  But do you prepare your mouth?  What?  Like some sorbet?  Or wash it out with some roll water?  Roll water.  Roll water.  How do you prepare your mouth?  Load.  You have some water. 
[01:30:00]  You have some water.  Cleanse the palate.  And you try to go, like, I don't know, 20 minutes without eating?  Just so, like...  20 minutes?  Just so your taste buds are all calmed down and ready to go to taste something new?  As soon as you're done with the water, you're ready to go.  Okay.  Dive in there.  And then what?  How many do you eat before you're ready to write your review?  Usually...  A bag.  No.  Usually you do two.  You try one, and then you try a second one just to make sure that you... 
[01:30:30]  Only two?  That's not bad.  And who's you?  Usually you do two.  The royal you.  Me.  See, you have two.  But he tries a second one just to make sure.  I love that.  Just make sure, right?  How many do you celebrate after the review?  How many celebratory cookies?  I can't do this bit and eat everything.  And then what happens to the rest of the bag of cookies?  Well, I left it out for when we had people over yesterday, so...  How come I wasn't invited?  Yeah, me neither.  I'd love to go to the Nagel house.  I don't think I was. 
[01:31:00]  He's been invited.  Blueberry cookie, Jim?  Well, thank you.  I think he's had it with us.  I don't blame him.  Are you kidding?  Jim walked in, said hi to no one, ate, and then looked around the kitchen, and then he  left again.  Wow.  But it was all family.  I said hello to you and Ash.  I didn't know anybody, though.  I felt bad.  I thought you had a lovely home.  Iraq, you didn't give a good rundown on the cookie itself, though.  You said hi to no one?  Is it butter?  Is it oatmeal?  What is the cookie surrounding the blueberry?  It's a typical Pepperidge Farm kind of cookie.  Like a chocolate chip would be in there? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, it's that kind of texture.  Just a cookie.  Regular cookie.  But what makes it dull?  It's got a nice blueberry and a buttery taste to it to make it kind of cobbler-ish.  Yeah, the cobbler part is butter.  A little bit of cinnamon in there.  Gotcha.  A little butter, right?  Then it's cobbler.  All right.  Did you review anything else over the weekend?  A long weekend?  Had some drinks.  You reviewed drinks, too?  Yeah.  Hell or high watermelon.  Hell or high watermelon.  All right.  This is Erock Radio on Instagram.  You're going to get a lot of followers today. 
[01:32:00]  Hashtag the consumer.  Hashtag the consumer.  But you've got to make videos, I'm telling you.  But what does he have to say about hell or high watermelon?  He writes, I am in no way anything close to a beer expert.  I got an N.  Oops.  Oh, this is a beer.  It's not a bad thing.  I do.  Oh, jeez.  This is brave of you to try to, like, give reviews on beers.  Cool.  The consumer is a beer taster as well. 
[01:32:30]  I'm trying.  Although the Fruity Pebbles beer he brought last summer to my...  Awesome Lennon Kugel.  What you mean?  Sunset Wheat.  It was really good.  Lennon Kugel?  Yeah.  You can't have too many of them.  From Michigan.  You mix it in with a little Coronas or something else and you're good.  Yeah.  I liked them.  He writes, I do, however, know what I enjoy.  Uh-oh.  You need this.  Hell or High Watermelon.  This summer seasonal by 21st Amendment.  A small San Francisco brewery with an all-time brewery.  This guy's trying to get his groceries paid for. 
[01:33:00]  He really is.  This product has been available for a while.  It's a very nice...  It's a very nice wheat beer brewed with watermelon water.  Hold on, Sam.  Can I interrupt you?  This is what happened at home.  Yeah.  His wife started to scream at him and say,  these bills for your fucking treats are astronomical.  And he's trying to figure out a way to make them a tax write-off.  Yeah, yeah.  So he's like, they're a part of my business and I'm reviewing them.  That's a nice idea.  It is.  They're all a write-off. 
[01:33:30]  So it's made with watermelon water.  Yes.  The watermelon has a very nice subtle aftertaste.  Perfect for the heat.  Fill water balloons with it and have your friends throw them at you.  A little humor.  Hashtag the consumer.  The consumer.  And they wrote me back.  I am the consumer.  Wait, they wrote you back.  What?  What did they say?  They liked my review.  They weren't sure about the water balloons, but they said thank you. 
[01:34:00]  And they may be sending some stuff.  Oh, a little envelope.  Nothing wrong with a good envelope every once in a while.  Well, if you take care of the consumer, the consumer takes care of you.  That's right.  Nice.  You fuck with the consumer, you will rue the day.  Yeah.  A lot of rueing.  Fuck with the consumer, you get the horns.  Right.  That's right.  Roland, stay there.  We're going back to the barbecue.  Don't worry.  Oh, yeah.  Are we going back now?  Were there any other products that E-Rock tested? 
[01:34:30]  Not over the weekend outside of the barbecue fest.  I love the consumer reports.  Start a website, E-Rock.  You need a website, not just Instagram, because you've got to do an Instagram one,  but you have to have a website so you can do more in-depth reviews.  The video, though, where you show the product and all that.  Absolutely.  You putting your face in the bag enjoying the bouquet of cookies?  Fucking the screams of not again coming from the other room.  Everything has to be mass-produced in factories, though. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  So the barbecue fest.  Fuck.  Wow.  So all that cookie talk got me.  Are you excited?  Yes.  Wowee.  That's bad.  Damn, I just itched my butt and popped a pimple.  Smell your finger.  Oh, God damn it.  What the fuck?  Wash your hands.  What's wrong with you?  Popped a little pimple.  Oh, nice.  A little one.  Nothing crazy.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  And, Roland, more about the barbecue fest, please, if you will. 
[01:35:30]  I was only there on Saturday for a few hours.  But Roland made himself right at home.  He had a chair.  He was like the mayor of the barbecue fest.  Everybody knew who he was.  They were coming over and saying hi to him.  Wow.  He didn't need a pass.  He could just come and go as he pleased.  In through barriers.  They let you in?  Oh, yeah.  I know the pitmasters.  Is anyone else amazed at how many people Roland knows?  It is amazing.  It amazes me when I walk around with him.  How do you do it? 
[01:36:00]  Other pitmasters, I walk by, there's like a chair line, and then the woman goes, it's  back there.  Like, shh.  And they go, come on in.  I'm like, thank you.  It's two hours?  Two to three hours, yeah.  It's like thousands of people are going.  People wait that long for some fucking barbecue?  Yeah, they spend like two, three hundred bucks for the VIP pass.  Just go somewhere and get a fucking barbecue sandwich.  Hey, I'm going to go down the street and get a pulled pork.  I'll see you in four hours.  Buy yourself a grill.  Yeah, call up a family member.  I'm sure they're barbecuing.  Those smokers are millions of dollars that they bring over. 
[01:36:30]  Why?  Because it's special smokers.  Don't kill me.  I don't understand this world.  I'm asking questions.  What do you get with the VIP pass?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  What do you get with the VIP pass?  A free trip to Beth Israel.  The VIP go behind the other line, but still an hour and a half wait.  Yeah, it's supposed to be like the fast track pass like at Disney World.  There's the regular line and then there's the VIP line, but the VIP line has gotten so ridiculous that if you spend all that money, you're still waiting just as long as regular people. 
[01:37:00]  Could people wait more than a half hour for free barbecue?  Oh, yeah.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Why would you do that?  The streets were mobbed for every area that they had blocked off.  It was almost impossible to walk around.  Roland just walks around like the Black Hand in The Godfather 2.  Hey!  Scrabbing shit.  Oh, this is much too violent.  Jacket sitting on his shoulders.  Yeah.  I enjoy a good sample, but I would never wait over. 
[01:37:30]  I wouldn't even wait a half hour.  After six minutes, I'd be home.  Right.  I wouldn't even wait a half hour for a cronut.  No, I just go walk around and saw the guys from Salt Lake from Austin.  It was a three-hour line.  I walked by, saw the pitmaster.  They went, oh, wave me in.  Go there, try their sausage and their brisket.  And then I move on.  And then he moves on like locust.  Then I move on and make my way to my final destination is Pamardens. 
[01:38:00]  I just hang out there.  Pamardens.  Pamardens.  Yeah.  They eat the whole hog and just relax with the Cuban and the other chefs.  Thomas Keller was there.  So it was a lot of fun.  Other chefs would hang out.  I don't know if these are fucking chefs or Civil War heroes.  I don't know the names.  I know all Thomas Keller.  Yeah.  He has a huge restaurant.  But they're all the big chefs hang out.  You drink beer and bullshit.  So wait, did they tell you to get online when you get there?  No. 
[01:38:30]  But I'm just saying like somebody who doesn't know who you are will go like, okay.  They get back to the line.  I just keep on walking like, shut up.  There you go.  Then I get to my pitmasters.  I go, look at these people.  They go, come on in.  And I just go through the back.  How much do you end up eating?  Not too much because I just eat a little sample of each of the things because I got to keep  my stomach ready for other samples.  You don't want to spoil yourself in one place.  Yeah, and plus the meat's heavy.  So I just had like a few bites and then I move on.  It doesn't add up to be a lot. 
[01:39:00]  Well, I didn't say that, but yeah.  It was so weird watching him pace himself.  I think he did good shit at nighttime, good shit in the morning and around two.  He paces himself for these things?  Yeah.  When we were at the Ubon tent from Ubon Barbecue.  You mean Ubon?  Ubon.  That's what Roland says, but I think it's Ubon.  We were all saying Ubon, so whatever.  So we were there and they gave us food and this special bourbon drink with pineapple.  It was amazing.  Just drinking it.  He locks a fucking alcoholic. 
[01:39:30]  I love it.  He ends up fisting.  Bloody Mary too.  Right, yeah.  So Roland has a sample of everything and then he stops, has a little bit of water and then  he's walking around and it looks like he's doing deep knee bends.  He's leaning on the table and I don't know if he's having a heart attack.  No, he's fighting for his life.  And then he's just like, oh, I gotta walk around a little bit.  I gotta walk around.  I'm like, what's going on?  He goes, well, they're making another course right here, so I gotta get ready for it.  So he walks around, paces, then comes back and then...  He gets ready. 
[01:40:00]  This is like sex for you.  Yeah, it's...  Right?  I like to tease him, but it's like, I understand.  That's like being in a fucking place with all hookers or a red light district.  You go crazy.  You can't...  And they all invite you in.  Like, come on in.  The biggest girl is here.  She's new in town.  Oh, right over.  Okay, then.  She had to smoke for 12 hours.  Oh, God.  Sometimes they look like the pig that they were...  You know, I snout, same thing.  No nose, get burned off.  Oh, fucker.  You're like, no reviews of the barbecue fest for the consumer? 
[01:40:30]  I did not...  No, I did a couple.  What about the U-Bons Bloody Mary mix?  That is up there on...  Yeah, there it is.  Yeah, we did that.  The pork butt sandwich with the bourbon special was up there as well.  Oh, so this is from the barbecue fest.  Right, yeah.  Oh, let's read about U-Bons Bloody Mary mix, Sam, please.  Bloody Mary mix is really unbelievable.  Gluten-free, fat-free, no MSG.  You gotta shake the hell out of it before mixing. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  So good.  The barbecue sauce is awesome as well.  Order some.  Then he gives the website.  Oh, you want free stuff.  I love you.  Yeah, but if you want some, I could get a box into you.  They're delicious, the Bloody Mary mix.  Plenty of barbecue sauce.  I love a good Bloody Mary there.  What's it?  Yeah, I'll try it.  It's got a nice spice to it.  So you don't have to add anything else to it except for the vodka?  Yeah.  Really?  But you have to shake it up each time.  Really?  I'll try some of that.  Yeah, they sold out around 2 o'clock.  And tell them to send an envelope because we're talking about them today. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  A little envelope for the boys.  Three envelopes, please.  U-Bons, U-Bons.  Fresh out of the smoker, U-Bons Mississippi pulled pork.  The coleslaw is the perfect mix of vinegar and mayo.  And wash it down with the U-Bons special.  All of a sudden, he's got a sophisticated palate.  Exactly.  Like, what the fuck?  Exactly.  Wipe your mouth with a Doctor Who shirt.  This kid has no dimmer switch. 
[01:42:00]  A mere two months ago, he was all in with Dr. E. Smith.  Yeah, yeah.  Diet.  And the diet.  Anything else?  Any other reviews?  That's it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was a huge success, the barbecue fest.  It was.  Do you ever eat vegan?  Yeah.  I ate a place called, what's it called?  Something pure food and wine?  Oh, that's my friend, Sarma Melanchiala.  Of course it is.  That place was awesome.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing.  Bill Clinton eats there and a lot of top people, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  Did you go with a girl because she was a vegan?  No, me and one of my buddies.  Of course.  Because it's like, you'd never go to a vegan place unless you were out with a vegan.  That was really good.  She invited me and I had their lasagna.  Yeah, I had the lasagna.  It's really good.  And the mint ice cream thing at the end was fucking amazing.  But how do they make ice cream?  I haven't, dude, I don't know what they use, but it's probably soy again.  It was so good, man.  It's the best vegan restaurant in the city.  Yeah, I think so.  I like vegan. 
[01:43:00]  No, but I don't either.  I got to go there to try it out again.  It was so good, dude.  Yeah, it's really good.  Everyone raved about it, I'm like, it's probably not going to be as good as they said.  I'd rather have lasagna instead of vegan lasagna.  Trust me, I'm with you, but her lasagna is really good.  But what makes it so good if you're eating a lasagna?  I don't know.  You need the meat in there.  No.  You need some cheese, some real cheese.  What replaces the meat?  All that good animal stuff.  I didn't ask.  It's like, she has like eggplant and some other stuff in it, but it's delicious.  Dude, it's great.  I like a good eggplant if it's prepared properly. 
[01:43:30]  What's wrong with the eggplant?  The eggplant has feelings too, you know?  Well, you never give that consideration.  That the plants that they're murdering have feelings.  Eh, it's alright.  It's in my stomach.  It comes out of my asshole.  It has something.  That's murder enough.  Plants have something.  If you look at it as far as the whole universe goes, there's something going on with plants.  Maybe we don't understand it, but it's probably the equivalent of...  You know what?  Anything that doesn't ever move, fuck it.  Just stands there.  You're begging to be eaten.  Oh, that's certainly... 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, exactly.  The next time I can pet a yam, I won't eat a...  That certainly is the human perspective.  It sure is.  If a yam goes to get the paper and bring it back, I won't eat yams.  And also, she makes fresh juices.  Yeah.  One lucky duck.  What's that?  It's her juice place that's connected to her pure food and wine.  What kind of juices?  Look, I got a juice right now.  That's better.  It's really, really good.  Do you have an outdoor little area there?  Yep.  Man, did I break out that Nutribullet over the weekend. 
[01:44:30]  Nice.  Did you make some ice cream?  Oh, no.  You throw a bunch of fruit in there, some fucking rum.  Sangria?  Oh, no, no.  Just some rum and fruit and ice.  It made a fucking nice fruity drink.  I don't know why the Nutribullet people don't advertise that.  It was...  Right?  They're all about Nutribullet, you know, healthy shakes and stuff and smoothies, but there's  a whole market of people that would mix some nice drinks out of that. 
[01:45:00]  It's so quick.  Big salad dress is just right there.  Don't have to clean anything.  Nope.  I told the Nutribullet people over the weekend to send me another blender.  I don't ask.  I just tell them.  You got to two-fist it?  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I need a few blenders, so I just told them.  And then what they did?  Send me your address.  We didn't get the, um, Dr. Ian's, are they off the assembly line yet?  Those giant old blenders?  I keep trying to tape his infomercial.  Yeah.  Like, I'll see it on the guide real late at night, like 4.35 in the morning. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Every time I set it to tape, it's Zumba.  Like, it advertises his thing, but his thing is never on.  Oh, it's never there, yeah.  I think we fucked up his world when we told him, you know, about the Nutribullet, where  you don't clean the, you don't have to, like, dig in to clean blades anymore.  Oh, I think that fucked his whole thing up.  And I think it fucked him up, and he, I think he made a phone call to stop the assembly line.  Yes.  And according to Twitter, people have been posting that his books are 70% off at various bookstores.  That happens after a little while.  Yeah, that happens.  You get the initial run, and then all that shit goes away. 
[01:46:00]  Especially with diet books and things like that, because you can get that stuff online,  so people, like, you know, I think it's hard to sell books, period, now, unless you're,  like, doing a biography, a rock biography or something.  But his logic isn't going to change, so you might as well have just waited a couple months  for the book to be 70% off.  Yeah.  And you're 70% on, Iraq.  Nice.  See?  You gained 70% more weight.  There'll be more reviews later today.  I love them.  Wait, what, what, what, what reviews later today?  Some, uh.  You can't keep up with this.  Some different booze, some new snacks. 
[01:46:30]  Ian Smith has to come out with a blender that you can put pork sandwiches and blueberry  cookies in.  Right.  And then Iraq will.  Make it into a juicy.  Yeah.  Just having a shake.  Iraq, did you, um, gain the weight back that you lost through Dr. Ian Smith?  I'm sure I did.  Have you given up?  No.  What does that mean?  I mean, I haven't, uh, given up, but I haven't also made an effort.  That's true.  Eric, I call, I'm, right now, I'm a sabbatical. 
[01:47:00]  You're a sabbatical.  You're a sabbatical.  He's on leave.  You could be on sabbatical.  Yeah, stop replacing a fucking F with a B.  Oh.  That's so hurtful.  That is.  Sorry.  I didn't mean it.  Yeah.  Well, it sounds like you guys had a lot of fun there.  Any celebs?  No.  Chris DiSafano came on Sunday.  So he doesn't know.  Did he have some food? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, was that funny?  A lot of rage.  Oh, so great.  He was a psychopath.  He had a good appearance.  I hope he did well at Caroline's.  You get some numbers down there?  Yeah, he did well.  He did all right?  Good.  He's funny.  Good for him.  Oh, that's a great point.  Keith in Connecticut, instead of taking his call.  Connecticut.  At what point during the barbecue fest did you have to go to the bathroom, and where  did you go to the bathroom?  Did they have port-a-potty set up?  That must have been a disaster.  Oh, my God.  Those port-a-potty.  No, I have a system where I know how much I can eat and drink without going to the bathroom 
[01:48:00]  until I get home.  I need home base.  Oh, wow.  I like this shit at home, too.  By the way, Roland does not have a system, because I've seen him at restaurants have to leave  before the check comes, and run stiff-legged down mid-town sidewalks.  So your calculations are...  We're planning.  Your calculations are a bit off.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Hey, can you guys get this?  I'll pay you back.  I gotta go.  I gotta go.  It's okay.  I need to stiff-legged running out.  Calculating how much fuel he needs to get to a destination.  Plus, there's a hotel I know around the block that I use a restroom. 
[01:48:30]  I don't want to say the name of the hotel, so I don't catch me.  But I guess those port-a-potties over there were getting quite the workout.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, yes.  Wow.  At a barbecue.  Oh, my God.  Some poor sap right now is hosing them out.  Oh, my God.  Do you know how, like, in the port-a-potty world, how, like, the fucking...  The vegan port-a-potties are probably laughing so hard at the ones that get stuck onto the  fucking barbecue? 
[01:49:00]  I'm going to Bonnaroo.  Yes!  Hold on, man.  My wife, Carolyn.  Uh...  First of all, I need to apologize to the winners.  The horse honor.  The horse honor.  California Crow.  He's apologizing.  He deserved that.  I did not mean to take anything away from them.  So, I want to apologize to everybody associated with...  Tony West, his trainer, Mr. Clement. 
[01:49:30]  I sincerely apologize.  This is the world we're in.  I apologize to all the horse racing in the world.  I'm a very thorough apology.  Apologize to the horses.  He certainly was indirect.  I have to give him at least credit there for being direct about it and with his wife right  there.  But his original comment, you know, a lot of people do agree with it.  If you're a horse...  No, not a lot of people agree.  That doesn't make sense.  Someone said, by the time you get to Belmont, there's only a few horses that ran the two 
[01:50:00]  previous races.  Like, this year, it was three that ran all three races.  Just run three horses.  Cawthon won.  How many people were in that race?  How many horses?  Someone tweeted me that it was four.  That was the whole race?  No, no.  But it was four horses that ran all three races.  Yeah.  So, this happens all the time.  That it's brand new horses for the Belmont that you haven't seen in the other two races.  How funny is this world?  I was just about to ask...  That's hilarious.  Where are we at with the apologies and the apology clock? 
[01:50:30]  Trying to go ten days here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And there it is.  That was live.  We just popped the TV up.  I won't apologize for my wife.  Throw the horses.  But he doesn't want to apologize.  That's what...  No, he doesn't look like a guy that apologizes.  I love that shit.  That was a guy speaking his mind, and that's okay.  Why?  Who gets to him and says, you better apologize immediately?  And the other horse owners probably understand it in the end.  Yeah.  They're all...  They all seem to be a bunch of assholes, right?  Right.  I think you've got to be an asshole to own a horse, I would assume. 
[01:51:00]  No?  I don't know.  They're probably, you know, elite, I would say, at that level.  Well, what happens?  Two days ago, he was all in, and now he was looking down, and he was somber, and I got...  He just apologized to the whole world, I think.  We are in the fucking age of the apology.  It's amazing.  But it's all bullshit.  It is all bullshit.  The guy meant what he said.  I love watching that.  I think most of us love watching those moments, but because of all these dumb apologies, you're 
[01:51:30]  not going to see any of those moments anymore.  Any other apologies over the weekend?  I think there were a couple, right?  Sure there were.  Had to be.  Didn't Chris Daughtry apologize, I think?  What did he apologize for?  What did he do?  Well, that was part of the awkwardness that you were going to play?  Yeah, I know.  What happened?  We can play that now as we look up the other apologies.  I know there was a couple more apologies over the weekend as we try to go ten days.  Damn.  Yeah.  Let's play the Chris Daughtry clip from the books. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, let me hear that one.  This is a good one.  Good old Chris Daughtry.  This was on Fox and Friends morning show.  One of my...  The after show to the morning show.  The after show that was once invaded by that crazy cake lady, E-Rock.  One of my good Rochester friends is in this band, Elvio.  Elvio is doing very well with Chris Daughtry.  An extremely talented musician who's...  I mean, more friends with Brother Weez than me, but I've seen him over the years. 
[01:52:30]  Great guy.  And all of a sudden, Chris Daughtry...  He used to tell us that he's friends with Chris Daughtry.  We're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you mean friends, you know?  But he was in the business, so we assumed that he just kind of maybe ran into him here and there.  But all of a sudden, Chris Daughtry picked him up, picked him out of Rochester.  He said, all right, time to tour the world with me.  And pretty much has to leave his family and his family behind.  He sees his kids every once in a while.  Nice.  Nice tour, though.  He's gone a month, then he comes home for a week or two, and then he's gone another month. 
[01:53:00]  Get away from the kids.  The Chris Daughtry, he's doing well for himself.  Is he good?  I liked him on Idol.  I liked him a lot on Idol when I used to watch American Idol.  He's talented.  I liked his voice.  He had to kind of go into that pop genre, because the rock genre is dead.  So I don't really dig a lot of his songs that he's done since Idol, but he's got a great voice.  And LVO has helped pump up some of his shit. 
[01:53:30]  So this is from what?  The Fox and Friends after show.  Oh, okay.  They had already performed.  Right.  And so they were asking Daughtry to perform another song.  Right.  What is the after show?  Is it just online?  Yeah, they just film it for their online.  They just leave the cameras rolling, and then they think that it's good enough that they  can just improv.  Oh, really?  They suck?  Yeah.  I mean, you saw the cake thing.  That was all the after show.  E-Rock made that thing exciting.  That was weird before.  What did he do? 
[01:54:00]  E-Rock, oh.  Well, he took a cake out of Elizabeth Hasselbeck's hand.  Yeah.  And then he smashed it in his own face.  Come on.  No one would do that.  No, E-Rock did that.  See, E-Rock, you should have...  The consumer.  The consumer, if you did a video, you could have showed the cake smashing, and then you  could have reviewed what the cake tasted like.  It was very buttery.  Well, that's what he should do, like...  His sophisticated skull.  And the frosting burnt my eyes.  Oh.  You gotta review, like, different types of cupcakes, and every time you review a cake, 
[01:54:30]  you go, and I know a thing or two about cake, and then run to a clip of you smashing yourself  with cake.  Yeah.  Yes.  Are you in touch with the Food Network?  Me?  No.  Why?  This is a good idea.  They're all Roland's friends.  But you gotta spin it a little bit, and I think you might do all right with this.  He's finding his niche.  Yeah.  I should just open stuff in the supermarket and review it.  Oh, man.  Don't even pay for it.  Just start doing it in the aisles.  That'll be a good one.  Laugh, he's like a schoolgirl in there.  Because it's something with food.  He also forgot to tell you that after all the barbecue he ate, he was eating fried apple 
[01:55:00]  pies.  That sounds really good.  They were serving it to him.  A guy in overalls.  How do you...  Wow.  How does the fried apple pie...  Like, how do they do that?  I know they fry it, but...  It was pure heaven.  It was delicious.  Do they just take a regular apple pie?  No, they make it really small.  Like, uh...  They make a small little apple pie, and they fry it.  Aww!  That sounds...  That's adorable.  Sounds amazing.  Ice cream on it? 
[01:55:30]  No, no, no, no.  I can't have dairy right now.  Why can't you?  I can't have dairy right now.  Why not?  You can have everything else, but dairy?  He's worried about what he puts in his body.  Right.  It's a temple.  Oh, I see.  It's a temple.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Probably he's the temple of the lard.  Pile of rocks at this point.  All right, let's hear this.  Or see this, or whatever.  We get to see it.  They don't get to see it, I guess.  Because we don't have a...  Oh, whatever.  You know the deal.  All right, go.  We don't have much of anything.  All right. 
[01:56:00]  Even the studio's breaking down and no one gives a fuck.  There we go.  He's not going to.  He's done.  We've worked him like a dog.  They're done.  So they want one more song from Daughtry.  Ready to go.  Ready to go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, so they got the crowd chanting one more song.  The band's not even on stage anymore.  Yeah.  Has he turned into an asshole?  Daughtry?  Is he put him in a bad spot here? 
[01:56:30]  The American Idol Daughtry would have done one more song.  But they put him on the spot.  His band's not even on stage anymore.  There's no band.  But they just go get the band.  Where's the band?  They're probably just in a green room somewhere.  You know how hard that is, though?  This isn't live TV.  Oh, it isn't, right?  No.  Yeah, but it's still being filmed.  If he fucks up, then it's everywhere.  But Daughtry, right after Idol, would have done it.  So what is he worried about?  Well, let's see.  My mic is gone.  Way to go. 
[01:57:00]  Steve, you're going to be performing.  I don't think so.  I'll play the drums again.  I'll give you the words.  I tell you what, since today is D-Day plus 70, what patriotic song could we all sing?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  It did not do this.  I'm off the clock.  I'm going to watch you all.  You don't want to be part of this?  No.  I don't know about that.  I agree with him.  You ever play the drums and the guitar?  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, here.  Should we do that?  Will you all sing My Country Tits of D with that?  There you go.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  For D-Day.  Anna, you leave.  Oh, you leave.  Show it yourself.  You got to open up a can of worms.  Oh, this is bad.  Coming down.  Keep down.  What are you doing?  This is where I bail.  This is where I bail.  She's hitting the microphone, not me.  I would have bailed us, too.  Daughtry's leaving.  He left.  Yeah, he left.  Why wouldn't he?  Kayla, where are you from and how old are you?  Denville and 12 years old.  All right.  Well, thank you for being here.  You happy to see Daughtry today?  Did you think you were going to get to sing on national television? 
[01:58:00]  No.  Did you guys think you were going to get to sing on national television today?  All right.  Let's do My Country Tis of D.  What an awful.  Did you see the energy of the crowd?  They were like, no.  We thought we were going to see Daughtry sing.  Right, not you.  What are they singing?  My Country Tis of D.  Because they don't think out of the box.  What are you doing?  What is that?  Who wants to see that?  No one wants to see that.  We'll prepare for these idiots on TV.  Sweet land of liberty.  All right.  It's a good song, but they don't.  Yeah, not really.  Yeah.  It just isn't.  All right. 
[01:58:30]  Go ahead and start us.  Ready?  My country tis of thee.  Sweet land of liberty.  Oh, she's all off-key.  Fucking boo this kid.  This kid sucks.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Boom.  Let's breathe on.  Boom. 
[01:59:00]  Happy Friday, everyone.  You guys sound terrific.  Let's make it a great day.  So why did he apologize?  Oh, because he kicked the kid.  Oh, good.  He apologized for what?  For walking off stage?  Yeah, I thought he apologized or something.  Oh, yeah.  Here's the video.  Oh, is that his?  Yeah.  Here's the video of him pretty much explaining.  Now I guess I don't blame him.  Not at all.  No way.  Head play.  Hey, everybody.  I wish I was coming to you right now under better circumstances. 
[01:59:30]  What?  Yesterday, Friday, D-Day, we performed on Fox & Friends.  At the end of the performance, after the break, they wanted me to come up and do a quick send-off at the end of the show, as we had another commitment to get to.  Sure you did.  As we get up there, the anchor, one of the anchors, asked me to lead everyone in a patriotic song to honor our troops. 
[02:00:00]  In that moment, I was thrown off, unprepared.  I panicked.  Ah!  And in that moment, I tried to ingest, make light of the fact that I was feeling awkward, the fact that I was unprepared.  And I said, I'm off the clock. 
[02:00:30]  I'll watch you guys.  Yeah?  Can you pause this?  Well, we know how all that worked out.  But this is...  What, veterans are getting after him?  I don't know who's getting after him.  I didn't even think for a second that...  Not for a...  That was a slight at veterans.  That was a...  I'm not going to stand here...  And look like an idiot.  I'm not an idiot singing anything with this news crew.  And...  Oh, my God.  I'm off the clock.  Yeah, I'll watch you guys. 
[02:01:00]  This world is fucking stupid.  This is where we live.  This is it.  He didn't say no to the patriotic song.  He said no to not...  He didn't want to do anything else.  And then they said something like, well, what about, you know, some kind of patriotic thing?  Holy shit.  But he already committed to saying, no, I'm done.  He never said no to the actual patriotic song.  They could have said, how about this, this, this, and this.  He already said, no, I'm done singing.  This is a non-apology.  But I'll watch you guys. 
[02:01:30]  This is no reason.  There's no reason for this apology.  But who got to him where he had to make a video from his couch?  Yeah, the veterans are...  We don't know.  And he seems a bit scared here.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  Keep going.  Continue.  It was absolutely disrespectful.  What?  Poor choice of words.  Terrible judgment on my part.  Why? 
[02:02:00]  The worst part of all, I didn't honor our troops.  I didn't honor our vets who so deserve it, who sacrifice everything.  Their lives have sacrificed everything for our country.  What we do, what I do, is minuscule in comparison.  All right.  Could you pause again?  Because singing My Country Tis of Thee with a bunch of clown news people means nothing to the troops. 
[02:02:30]  Well, she said something about...  This is what happened.  She said something about D-Day.  Right.  Yeah.  And he probably wasn't even paying attention to that.  He's probably like, he didn't want to sing.  But now you're looking back, someone probably got to him and said, they try to honor D-Day  and you walk off a live news show and then you're probably like, oh, fuck.  It was a clusterfuck.  Clusterfuck.  A bit cheesy on the anchors' parts.  Oh, my God.  Putting some ridiculous pressure on the guy after he said, no, I'm done.  If he had any fault at all, it's a one.  And this apology is worthy of a ten mistake. 
[02:03:00]  Like, he's way over the top with this.  Right.  A bit much.  The groveling.  You guys want to sing it, though?  I mean, I'll sing it.  Sam?  Get out of here.  No, why don't you lead us?  No, you lead us.  I'm off the clock.  I'm off the clock.  I'm on the cock.  What's worse?  The fact that you said that or the first thing I thought of was that?  Can't get a cock joke out fast enough in this fucking program. 
[02:03:30]  Shit.  All right, let's hear more.  We're only halfway through with this groveling.  Please.  In the beginning, I thought he should have sang another song, What the Hell?  But I don't think he should be apologizing for anything.  No.  Oh, nerds.  It wasn't a very planned thing.  To what they do for our country.  Without them, we would probably not be able to do what we do.  Fortunately for us, our troops have never said, I'm off the clock when they had to do what 
[02:04:00]  they had to do.  Well, you're getting all crazy.  I'm embarrassed.  Bird dog did that.  I'm off the clock.  I'm going to go over here to the fucking enemy.  If there was anything about me or this man, you know that we wholeheartedly support our  troops, have always and will always continue to do so.  He's rubbing his hands like fucking sling blade.  Humbled. 
[02:04:30]  One apologized.  One has a moment in their life that...  Newt Anker told me to sing.  Killed her.  What are you doing with that songbook?  I aims to sing.  She was standing up there with old Jesse Dixon.  She wanted me to sing that patriotic song.  Picked up a Kaja blade.  Like some people call it a sling blade, I call it a Kaja blade. 
[02:05:00]  Tom in Staten Island.  Tom.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  What could you add to this?  Happy birthday, Jim.  I was actually watching Fox and one of the commentators or one of the news guys was making  disparaging remarks about how Daughtry walked off when asked to do this song.  And he just kind of gave him the old, you know, wow, how could he do this to our vets? 
[02:05:30]  It was totally out of the way.  It had nothing to do with the patriotic song.  It was a bullshit move on their part.  It was tearing up to being an embarrassing clusterfuck.  Right.  And he walked off before he had to be involved in it.  And then they tried to get him to sing by going down that road.  But that's just bullshit.  I'm glad he stuck to his guns.  But then again, here he is groveling. 
[02:06:00]  Groveling.  Thank you, Tom.  They played the clip.  So, you know, they played the clip.  I didn't think the guy did anything wrong.  No.  You got to make something of it.  No.  You know, their comments apparently, you know, prompted him to, you know, oh, you know, they're  making me look like I don't like vets.  Yeah.  He made it clear he was done singing.  I mean, if they said right off the bat, let's do a patriotic song to like, you know, sing  us out of here, then I could see that it would have been a tougher position for him to be 
[02:06:30]  in.  But he made it clear he was done.  And then they said, well, what about a patriotic song?  Because it's the anniversary today.  Yeah.  All right, brother.  Well, fuck apologies.  Thank you.  Sorry, our listeners wanted to hear that language.  Well, we say fuck apologies because just about all of them are bullshit.  Yeah.  I think a good apology is just sets everyone straight.  Yes, Jimmy.  Absolutely.  Am I right or wrong?  Is he almost done?  He's just going on and on with this video, too.  Let's hear him.  He's so sincere. 
[02:07:00]  Yes, he is.  To know that I've disrespected the men and women who fight every day and who have fought  for this country have died serving this country.  That's so dramatic.  And I apologize.  There it is.  For offending any of our troops, any of the men and women who have served, past or present.  Past or present.  Any of the families.  Families of the people who serve.  Any of the people that watched. 
[02:07:30]  Watched.  People that watched.  Event go down.  So the world.  Just apologize to the world.  Can you apologize to what's wrong with this?  I'm sorry.  You only apologize to the men.  That's it.  Please continue.  Just the men.  Absolutely.  All right.  I apologize.  And I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my...  Indiscretion.  Lack of judgment.  Damn it.  My stupidity.  Did you deeply apologize?  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  You didn't deeply.  I wish that I could have pulled it together.  And sang my heart to honor our troops.  Can't...  Thank you for watching.  If you had to make that video, wouldn't you just be all about...  Those motherfuckers put me in a horrendous situation.  They put me in a terrible position.  I didn't want to sing anymore.  It had nothing to do with it.  Yes.  And then they pulled out that bullshit to put the pressure on me even more.  I didn't even hear what they were saying.  I just wanted to get the fuck out of there.  So it had nothing to do with our troops. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  Wow.  So...  Yeah.  He really was groveling in that one.  Well, if you have to apologize, can't you just come out and go, this is what happened?  And look, I'm sorry if it came off like that.  It wasn't...  Right.  But, you know...  Yeah.  Focus on the Fox people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other ones that kind of put you in a bad position.  Put them in a corner there.  Right.  Yeah.  Is that it for the apologies over the weekend, Sam Roberts?  That I saw.  Yeah.  I felt like there was one more somewhere.  There's my ex.  You're right.  Oh, Melissa, that's right. 
[02:09:00]  What happened there?  I don't know this one.  Famous fashion model, Melissa Stetton.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, apparently, someone must have gotten a hold of one of her tweets.  She writes for XO Jane.  Right.  You know, XO Jane.  And I've enjoyed some of her writings and rantings.  They're pretty good.  She's funny.  We've had the XO Jane on the show.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  What's her name?  Mandy?  No.  Oh, Mandy Stadmiller.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She works for them.  She was in for the Bell Knox interview.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the one. 
[02:09:30]  So then, I guess somebody dredged up an old tweet of Melissa's.  Um, she said, her tweet was, holy shit, uh, no, it's Ugg, Ugg, just accidentally rubbed  my arm on a minority in the subway.  That's how contagion started, right?  And, uh, cause she's, you know, going off the fact, I guess Gwyneth Paltrow touched a  Chinese guy's hand and caught the contagion thing. 
[02:10:00]  I don't know.  But obviously, when the movie was out.  Obviously, you're just going for a joke.  That's all it is.  She's just going for a joke.  That's going for a joke.  What's the problem with that?  And no one, and sarcasm, no one really thinks, like, she doesn't really think, I caught a  contagion.  She's giving out an opinion that's so silly.  Let's really, you know.  Who the fuck really believes she thinks she caught a contagion from, come on.  I'll be obviously going for a joke, so what's the problem?  You're not allowed to joke anymore?  I guess not.  About touchy things?  Get it.  Touchy.  She said, I tweeted this two years ago. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  And then she deleted it, I guess, recently.  Any normal person would see that and think, holy shit, she's saying that all minorities  are gross and disease stricken.  What a racist bitch.  See, that's sarcastic, because no one would really think that, would they?  In my mind, she just talks about that tweet.  She got a bunch of shit for it, and was apologizing. 
[02:11:00]  She goes, this tweet was obviously backfired.  Reading it now, it is 100% racist.  Even if you have seen contagion and got the reference.  Also, it wasn't funny.  I sincerely apologize.  So that's her apology.  But then, she has to continue.  Oh boy.  A larger issue that I need to address is my history with Anthony of the Opie and Anthony  show.  Oh boy.  I dated him for a little over a year, starting in 2010. 
[02:11:30]  I found his show funny and was a regular listener for quite a while before I met him in person,  of course.  I always had a dark sense of humor, and I prided myself on not getting offended by misogynist  jokes.  I was a huge tomboy growing up and always felt comfortable as one of the guys.  When I started dating Anthony, his humor and views definitely rubbed off on me.  I'm a fucking Spengali.  I'm like fucking, I'm like Charles Manson. 
[02:12:00]  Which tends to happen when I'm in a relationship.  Constantly being around misogynistic and offensive jokes became my life.  Constantly.  Fair enough.  It's like I'm constantly doing it.  That's a fair and accurate point she's making.  You might, Robert.  You might.  A little insight to the compound.  Yeah, huh?  And I participated, she said.  I'm not blaming anyone for forcing me to laugh at offensive jokes. 
[02:12:30]  There was the style of humor I was into at the time.  I was also 26 and still getting to know myself and thought Anthony and his pals were hilarious.  Good point, and you're right.  They are hilarious.  Absolutely.  A goring, Himmler, they're a pisser.  All my pals.  Oh, Jesus.  Anthony did an internet show from the house a couple of times a month that I would be on.  We would do commentary for shows like Hoarders, Toddlers in Tiaras, and such. 
[02:13:00]  By commentary, I mean we would make fun of and criticize the people on the shows.  Yes, even those with mental illness.  So?  I laughed at tons of Anthony's misogynistic and racist jokes.  Tons of them, huh?  Can I point out something?  What she's doing is smart because she sees they're digging.  Yeah.  So she's making a strategic move, like knowing that this stuff is out there. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Look, let me just cut this off at the pass, get ahead of it, and address it.  Digging fire lines.  Yeah, but then, yeah, like, oh yeah, I said that before.  Yeah, yeah.  Digging those fire lines around the thing.  Fire trenches around the fire.  But I mean, that's the world we live in where you have to now explain why you joked and laughed a certain way.  Yeah.  You gotta explain the things you did many years ago.  Many years ago.  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  I'm sure I've said some things that were mean and disrespectful as well.  I thought I was cool for being so laid back and in on the jokes while my older boyfriend, well, and his comedian friends went off. 
[02:14:00]  But comedian friends.  I'm a comedian and I'm a friend.  I know.  That's accurate.  They always had.  Thanks for the plug, Melissa.  Oh, they always had respect for women who could hang with the boys and I wanted to be accepted as a cool chick.  Cut to 2004 and I'm writing articles about accused rapists and criticizing men for saying degrading things about women. 
[02:14:30]  I'm the definition of a hypocrite.  I went through my Twitter timeline and old blog posts.  Wait, 2004?  I'm sorry, 2004 or 2014?  No, this is 2014.  Oh, okay, okay.  We're talking about modern times.  And I honestly was surprised at some of the stuff I said.  I was into shock comedy.  But it mostly came off as mean and shitty.  I'm not the same person I was a few years ago.  I'm legitimately embarrassed about some of the things I said and did. 
[02:15:00]  They were funny and entertaining at the time to my boyfriend and I.  But deep down, I knew that wasn't the real me.  I love this.  But you know what, though?  It's like now everything you do, we all go through those times, but now it's all documented and saved and traceable and readable.  Everybody goes through those times in a relationship where you kind of assimilate the personality of the person and you say shit you probably wouldn't have normally said.  Like, she didn't do anything wrong.  Yeah, I've spent most of my 20s trying to fit in and adapt to the men I date. 
[02:15:30]  Sometimes I would lose my own identity because I didn't have the confidence to be the person I knew I truly was.  It's embarrassing that it took so long to not be afraid of myself.  In the past, I didn't think about how my words would affect people.  I believed I didn't care about offending people.  Well, now I'm a writer and I have an opinion that's heard by many people and I don't want to use that platform to say racist and offensive things.  Nor do I want to be that person. 
[02:16:00]  I realize that thinking these jokes were funny and then having the luxury to change my mind is the definition of privilege.  Oh, no, she didn't say privilege.  And a big part of what racism is, is she out of her mind?  She's trying to save her job, I think, and she's, you know.  All I can say is that getting out of that environment with my ex was an eye-opener.  Probably a liver saver, too.  Jesus. 
[02:16:30]  I now see what those jokes were, what they are, mean.  Hurtful and disrespectful.  I have much more respect now for myself and others than I did back then.  Racism and sexism are serious issues, not a joke.  I can't just say don't pay attention to anything I've done in the past because I can't change it.  It's there forever.  But what I can say is I made mistakes and that I'm ashamed and I hope that I can redeem myself. 
[02:17:00]  I have no interest in being that person anymore.  I'm constantly trying to prove myself.  I hope I can continue writing here because I love entertaining strangers with my words more than anything.  And again, I'm truly sorry for the tasteless, racist, and offensive things I've said in the past.  XO, XO, Melissa.  How the fuck could they fire her after that honest?  And maybe she's...  Because that's what you get.  Like they wanted her to apologize.  Right.  And here's the feminine or feminist or strong part of that saying, look, I used to assimilate to the men I dated because I didn't have enough faith in myself. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  To be myself.  So I said things because I wanted to be accepted.  Like how is that not a strong feminist point of view to come out and realize that?  Fucking Rebecca Carroll, if she fired her after that apology, is dumb.  If that's what got her fired.  She said she got...  It says on the website that she got fired because after the apology she said something on Twitter that undermined her entire apology. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, what did she say?  Thank you.  Her tweets are gone.  But why wouldn't they post that tweet if they're saying that?  Hey, what was the tweet?  Anybody know?  Oh, all right.  So it wasn't the apology.  It was something after.  What was the ex post facto tweet?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Don't you want someone with honesty writing for you?  You would think so.  I got no problem if she wants to, you know, say, hey, I was this.  I'm that.  Don Corleone did this.  Michael Corleone did that. 
[02:18:30]  I just said it.  Anthony, call me a joke about this.  Anthony, call me a joke about that.  It's funny.  So they want me to say, say, yeah.  Anthony, kill me as a racist.  I made the retarded person noises.  Sitting at the compound drinking champagne, champagne cocktails.  Mike, you don't hire someone for XO Jane who talks like that. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, shit.  I knew there was another apology.  Huh?  A biggie, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We don't have that tweet from...  We don't have a tweet, huh?  No tweets about that?  If we get it, we'll certainly...  Yeah, that seems like some bullshit going on over there at Jane.  Damn.  Gatorade had to apologize.  I knew there was another... 
[02:19:30]  Gatorade?  Yes.  Because they spell it A-I-D and they put an S in an apostrophe and then LOL.  That was just inappropriate.  Boo.  Terrible joke.  Gatorade, sorry for mocking Powerade, spokesman LeBron James over cramping.  Fucking God.  What?  What happened?  Apologizing for mocking the competition.  When LeBron James had his stagger off the court last night, obviously a couple nights  ago now, with a heat-induced leg cramp, one brand seemed all too happy to pour a few  hundred milligrams of sodium into the wound. 
[02:20:00]  You can't even...  They're in competition with each other.  Gatorade, which mocked James in a series of tweets about how dehydration wouldn't be  an issue if he didn't drink something else, today apologized for the post.  Can you even...  James is the most high-profile celebrity endorser for Powerade, a fact which Gatorade's Twitter  account seemed to relish with vindictive glee after the basketball superstar had to take  an early exit from Game 1 of the NBA Finals. 
[02:20:30]  The person cramping wasn't our client, Gatorade told a fan, who mistakenly called James the  brand's number one client.  Our athletes can take the heat.  Uh-huh.  In another response to a Twitter user praising Gatorade for its topical zingers, the brand  wrote, thanks, Randy.  We've been hydrating all day.  We never cramp.  While the tweets remain up, the brand has issued a statement of apologies.  Our apologies for our response to fans' tweets, Gatorade said. 
[02:21:00]  We got caught up in the heat of the battle.  As a longtime partner of the Miami Heat, we support the entire team.  Oh, because they were...  Gatorade, he's not with them, so they were shitting on people, but they have a relationship  with the Heat.  Yeah, obviously.  But who gives a fuck?  Peter Heat.  And then he called me and said, fuck this.  And then he called me and said, fuck that.  I'm like, yeah, this happened.  So I just said it. 
[02:21:30]  That makes me laugh.  I love that guy.  And no one better than Frankie Five Angels.  Cheech!  Have a...  So that went down.  Gatorade apologizing.  Chris D'Archery apologizing.  Who else again?  Oh, yeah.  California Chrome's owner there apologizing this morning.  And then I think there was another one.  Damn.  Let's see.  Bob Evans Restaurant to all breastfeeding mothers. 
[02:22:00]  What happened there?  Due to one employee's mistake.  This is AC 1018.  I don't know.  I don't know this one.  I know what happened there.  There was the one breastfeeding, and they took her meal, and they threw it on the ground,  and they said, get out of here, dog.  And they threw the baby out the door.  And now they're looking back, like, maybe that was harsh.  You know, shouldn't have to apologize for that.  You just get all sanctimonious.  I'm just...  These fucking... 
[02:22:30]  These fucking apologies.  I'm sorry.  Oh, was that the tweet?  What was the tweet?  She wrote, in the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes for being accused of racism.  That's kind of funny.  So why does that...  Because it makes...  Why does that undermine her apology?  Because they feel that she...  Because we all know the apologies are fake.  Well, they feel that she probably should not have said that.  Shouldn't have said that about racism. 
[02:23:00]  But everyone's playing the game.  They know her apology is basically fake.  They're not stupid.  But even if...  They don't want her to stay in line with, you know, her sincerity, her fake sincerity, whatever.  But even if her apology wasn't fake.  Maybe she really means it.  I don't even know.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's say her apology is sincere.  That doesn't take away from the sincerity of her apology.  That is a tweet...  Right.  ...about the fact that everybody will be famous for 15 minutes, what Andy Warhol said years ago.  And the fact that being accused of racism is your new 15 minutes of fame in this day and age. 
[02:23:30]  It's a good line.  It's funny.  It's good.  It's a clever line.  But that undermined her apology?  How did that undermine...  Oh, people are crazy.  Wow.  They're just fucking nuts.  I really am astounded by this dumb world we live in now.  It's just so dumb.  What's the other apology for the breastfeed?  Is it good?  Is it sexy?  Is it hot?  In late May... 
[02:24:00]  I don't mind seeing a woman breastfeed, by the way.  I can't fucking...  Get a little peek at the park every once in a while.  It's not even sexy.  The boobs are all engorged.  Nothing sexy about it.  I agree.  There's a lot of milk in them.  Yeah.  I don't like anything with...  A lot of nourishment.  Childbirth.  I respect it, but it doesn't turn me on.  Pulls out one of those big filled boobs.  But there's this big dumb fucking kid's mouth on it.  I'm just slobbering it up.  Dumb little feet with socks on them, kicking. 
[02:24:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  I do oopsies and kick...  And kick?  Oh, no.  And kick balls toward them.  Oh, do you?  Whoops.  Let me go grab that.  Let me go grab that.  And she found a quiet little area to do her breastfeeding.  Yeah.  What's the apology on the Bob Evans restaurant, Sam Roberts?  An employee in Tampa embarrassed a breastfeeding mother by asking her to cover up in late May. 
[02:25:00]  The mother left a comment on the Facebook page.  So, over the weekend, Bob Evans posted this on their Facebook page.  At Bob Evans restaurants, we like to say that we treat strangers like friends and friends like family.  Recently, we treated one of our guests, a nursing mother, with less than the heartfelt hospitality our employees pledge to bring to each table each day.  What's their slug line?  Because slug lines at restaurants are all bullshit, too. 
[02:25:30]  I think it's Bob Evans.  We don't shit in the food?  I think so.  Naval officer surprises Daughtry.  Daughter.  Oh.  I've got to get my eyes fixed.  Yeah.  That's more of an education thing, I think, than my eyes fixed.  I certainly will take the beating, but I'll tell you why that happened.  I saw a dot, and your arm was covering the rest of it, but I'll still take the beating.  I'm an idiot.  Go ahead, Sam.  Um, we support the rights of nursing mothers, and would like to offer our sincere apologies. 
[02:26:00]  Ah, sincere.  Sincere.  I would have went with deep on that one.  Deep apologies.  Deepest.  Heartfelt.  I would have went deepest.  Yes, deepest apology.  Uh, to our guest for her recent experience.  That's nice.  We are re-educating our teams on local statutes to ensure education and awareness of the rights of nursing moms.  We are proud to host the nurse inn, being planned at our Dale Mabry location this Saturday, June 7th. 
[02:26:30]  Wait, so they're going to have a bunch of breast, uh, feeding mothers?  You should find out where this place is.  Yeah, that would be like an orgy for me.  Yeah.  Oh, a whole restaurant filled with them?  Go ahead.  And we'll offer any nursing mother a complimentary meal.  Right.  We will donate 10% of the day's receipts.  Milkshakes.  Milkshakes to keep it fun for everybody.  That's fun.  Got some fucking milkshakes.  Yeah.  For the nursing.  Get it? 
[02:27:00]  Uh, 10% to an organization of the affected guests choosing.  Oh, my God.  We look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate our support for these moms in their efforts.  No, they don't look forward to it at all.  They don't raise awareness.  Right.  They just know they have to do this to calm idiots down.  They don't look forward to it.  You don't think they're looking forward to it?  God, they just want to fucking make some dumb hamburgers.  Yeah.  What's the slug line for the restaurant?  I told you already.  What was it again?  Bob Evans, we don't shit in the food. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  Correct.  No, the family shit.  We, uh, treat strangers like friends and friends like family.  No, you don't.  You do not do that.  They treat family.  Like dog shit.  Yeah, that doesn't seem very nice because they treat, that's saying, hey, we treat family  like we do our friends.  I hate that fake.  Like, oh, we treat you like family here.  No, you don't.  You try to give us good service, certainly.  We treat strangers like friends. 
[02:28:00]  And then for your friends, that's like, you're a piece of shit.  No.  You treat me like you treat a stranger.  No, friends like family.  No, but you treat strangers like you treat friends.  No, you treat strangers like friends.  And friends like you treat family.  And if you already know them, then you treat them even better.  So then your family, you go, oh, I'm no better than just one of your friends.  No, your family, you treat so good, no one will believe it.  That's the line.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Go stranger, go over to his house, try to borrow the fucking lawnmower.  There you go.  What?  You're not treating me like a friend.  That's right.  True.  I don't know you.  Yeah.  All right.  I think that's it for apologies.  Oh, I hope so.  Me and you both.  That's five.  I think.  Breastfeeding.  What was the other one before that?  Oh, Gatorade.  You have Chris Daughtry.  You got California Chrome.  And Melissa.  And Melissa Stanton.  We just did five apologies.  Not going 10 days.  Oh, I didn't even play the fucking stinger. 
[02:29:00]  That Troy put together.  We can play it right now.  Yeah, let's play it right now.  As we go to break.  Oh, no, you can't.  Because then it says here's today's apology or something like that.  Whatever.  All right.  You guys want to fuck around?  What?  Yeah.  Let's make out a little bit.  Jesus.  The Opie and Anthony channel.  All Opie, all Anthony, all the time.  It's real.  Welcome to Should I Suck a Dick or Not?  The show where nationally known comedians meet our panel and try to decide, should I suck 
[02:29:30]  a dick or not?  Today's guest, Joe DeRosa.  I do a bit about this, about like the stair step up to it.  It's like it's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  I might be fucking all in.  I might want to go all the way.  Here's the thing.  Now, what would you do with the dick?  Thank you.  That's the thing I don't know.  That's what he hasn't really answered.  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz.  No, you have to.  That's the thing.  Why are you making these rules? 
[02:30:00]  Florentine's rules.  Because it makes it more interesting.  Florentine's rules.  Okay.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I've had my own jizz on my face.  What's the difference?  It's another man's.  Wow.  It looks like Joe DeRosa is going to suck dick.  That's all the time we have this week.  Tune in next time when Ricky Gervais tries to decide.  That's not only a dick.  That's the biggest dick in the world.  Should I suck a dick or not?  Somewhere in the Middle East, a murderous crime ring is about to trigger an international crisis. 
[02:30:30]  Who can the world turn to to face this nightmare head on?  Two of the world's most notorious mercenaries team up to face this never-ending catastrophe.  If only they could stop arguing.  Are you professional or not?  Suck my tennis cup! 
[02:31:00]  He's an international superstar with an overblown ego and a really short fuse.  What don't you fucking understand?  Give me a fucking answer!  He's a drug-addicted, alcoholic, incontinent, bankrupt former wrestler with blown-out knees and a 10-inch penis.  Suck my tennis cup!  If they can get along, they might just manage to save the world.  Think for one fucking second!  Keep your fucking monster up!  Christian Bale 
[02:31:30]  Motherfuckin' kick your fucking ass!  You don't shut up for a second, alright?  The Iron Sheik  That son of a bitch!  This summer, one gets pissed off.  No!  Really easily.  No!  The other pees all over himself.  Fuck my fucking bitch, pussy!  Pissed on and pissed off.  Coming this summer.  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  On Sirius XM.  Best news ever.  So, uh, that cat in Brooklyn that was kicked by that animal. 
[02:32:00]  Oh my goodness, right.  We all remember that.  Which we named, uh, Punty.  Little Punty.  We felt like it needed a name.  Yes. 
[02:32:30]  And we also told you, uh, probably almost a month ago now, that this thing would be adopted.  Yeah.  It is up for adoption.  Is it up for adoption or got adopted or anything?  It's up for adoption.  That means this thing will be adopted right away.  It's famous.  Everyone wants a famous cat.  Yeah, King the cat who survived a vicious kick in Brooklyn is up for adoption.  Here's your update on this story.  This was an obvious one, right?  When we told the people it's what happened.  The one-year-old male cat that survived the brutal kick from a heartless perp outside of Brooklyn Housing Project last month is ready to be adopted. 
[02:33:00]  The ASPCA had been caring for King since a group of animal rescuers captured the skittish gray kitty on May 6th.  So they had to get the cat all back together.  Yeah.  How do they get these things ready for adoption?  I don't know.  I know they do all the shots and stuff, but do they try to retrain them?  Just their personality and everything.  They try to retrain it a little bit, the brain?  Good luck.  King suffered tissue injuries as a result of the trauma and was treated with painkillers. 
[02:33:30]  Painkillers, he recovered successfully and is doing well.  So somebody will be adopting this cat, I'm sure, immediately.  I mean, you know, we talked to Travis about his attempt to adopt a full-grown cat, and that didn't go well.  That's nuts.  I think you can adopt a full-grown dog before a full-grown cat.  Yeah, even that.  They got their own fucking problems.  Dogs?  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  But cats, man, they're just setting their ways.  Cats will fuck you up.  That's it.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, a full-grown adult cat that's been abused or something, or feral, it's just out there fucking screaming in the night.  But, yeah, try bringing that one home.  Try having a fun little pet it.  Oh, well, I just want to pet it.  Thing will be like, and rubbing its head on you, and then the next second, your fucking ten claws are in you. 
[02:34:30]  What is the definition of feral?  Does it just mean outdoors?  Wild.  Just wild?  Wild.  Can you calm that shit down?  No.  I don't think you can.  No?  I think it's...  Because they've just been outside too long?  It's so animalistic, and it's depended on its own survival skills for so long that, you know, you're just a threat.  They probably would just get depressed if it was in your house?  After fucking everything up and probably pissing on every corner of your house.  It needs to run, right? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, run, eat birds.  I love this helicopter story, to be honest with you.  Oh, the three inmates?  I love that you got three inmates.  They tried to escape from a prison or some kind of lock-up facility in Quebec.  They tried to use a helicopter.  How long ago was that?  I don't know.  It was a while ago.  Maybe we have the story here.  And then, you know, they got caught, and they got sent back.  So, these guys turn around.  And it's the same guys?  That's why I love this story. 
[02:35:30]  I thought it was the same method for different guys.  No, because, you know, the lock-up facility is like, well, obviously, they'll never try to escape with a helicopter again.  And, you know, these guys are in a cell or in the whatever, in General Pomp or something going, you know what?  We're going to fucking do the same fucking thing.  Let's just do it again.  Because they're not going to expect that.  The only thing that didn't work was this, so we'll make sure we change that.  Like, they tried it out once and figured out what didn't work.  I probably shouldn't say I love these guys because I have no idea why they're in jail, but I'll tell you this much. 
[02:36:00]  The balls it takes to try the exact same thing twice.  I love that part of the story.  I'm sure if they're escaping from prison in a helicopter, they did bad things.  Iraq's got his hand up.  March of last year, they were posing as tourists, and they commandeered the helicopter.  So, they just climbed up the ladder thing as the helicopter was getting ready to take off.  So, they were in the helicopter for the first time.  What do you mean, tourists?  Tourists are going to jails? 
[02:36:30]  It said they were posing as tourists, commandeered the helicopter from a Canadian tour company,  ordered the pilot to fly over the detention center near Montreal, and then hoisted the other two guys up on the...  Oh, some of the boys from outside.  Yeah.  Yeah, the boys from outside are like, hey, we're on sightseeing, this is great.  And then, you know, put a gun to his head and go, now take us over to prison.  Of course.  And the thing is, like, you think the prison officials, once they know these guys have done that,  the next time there's inmates in the yard, they hear... 
[02:37:00]  They'll be like, we should keep our eyes on the...  Right.  Why are they going to the fence again and looking up?  Maybe we should keep an eye on that noise.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not like they fucking snuck out in a stealth bomber.  It's a hell...  Like, it's the loudest thing.  It's like an angry duck landing in your yard.  Three inmates have escaped from a detention center, okay, with the help of a helicopter.  We are working with a few partners like the airports of Quebec City and surrounding areas,  the military bases, and of course, there's a ground search in the event that the helicopter is located. 
[02:37:30]  They haven't even found the copter yet, huh?  Mm-mm.  Damn.  Damn.  So...  That's...  So they tried the same thing.  Canada?  Quebec, yeah.  Yeah.  What could they possibly have done?  Oh, ho, ho, ho!  We're going up there to broadcast, are we not?  They probably told some kind of a racially inappropriate joke and we're thrown in prison for fucking 50 years.  Right.  They don't like words heard up there. 
[02:38:00]  You know.  Let's say hi to Tim in New York.  Timmy.  Timmy Kins.  Hello, happy birthday, little Jimmy.  What?  That is, uh...  You guys have been on the air, and I loved you guys since the 90s, 102.7, but honestly, lately, you guys have sucked.  Wow.  No.  What could we do better, you think?  I don't know, but honestly, like, I love you guys.  I listen to you in your morning commute all the time, but I have better interviews. 
[02:38:30]  I don't know.  Opie, you suck.  You always have.  I don't know.  Yeah, thanks.  Hold on now, Tim.  You opened up with such a nice compliment.  Right.  What happened?  And you turned it into an unpleasant discussion.  Jimbo, I'm sorry.  What happened here?  Oh, you like Jimbo, though.  I like Jimmy, and I like Anthony, and I like you.  I just feel like lately you need to step it up.  Opie.  What is it?  I don't need to step up anything for you, Tim.  How's that sound?  All right?  That sounds great.  I'll see you at the end of the dial.  Later, homie.  I'm out.  What does that even mean? 
[02:39:00]  Oh.  I don't know.  That was a line Denny used.  Oh.  Oh, well.  So he's a fan.  Ugh.  These people.  It's just a chore.  Yeah, you used to be good.  Now you just step it up.  Oh, what should be changed then?  What was better?  I don't know.  You just got to.  Oh, so you don't know.  Then, Tim, why don't you have the balls to try to do your own fucking thing?  There you go.  I would have respect for some of these people if they try to do their own thing. 
[02:39:30]  They don't even fucking try anything.  Oh, well, not like this guy.  Except for Sam.  He tries a little too hard.  He tries so hard.  I'm nothing, Sam.  He tries so hard.  So, dude, do your own show.  Yeah, yeah.  The market is wide open.  There's not many radio shows left.  So if you think you could do it better than me or anyone else in this room or the show  in general, go do it.  Because then you could fucking kick ass and be really wealthy. 
[02:40:00]  There you go.  Go for it.  That's what I would say.  Go for it.  Give it a whirl.  Give it a whirl.  Instead of sitting back and just observing and never doing anything with your life.  There's a million ways to do it now.  You don't have to be hired by a major company to do it.  Some of the people out there are trying to do it themselves.  I respect all those guys for giving it a shot.  I don't respect anyone that just sits around and observes and does nothing for themselves.  What's wrong with the show?  I don't know, but...  I don't know, but...  It's like, how am I supposed to take that at all serious? 
[02:40:30]  It doesn't fucking tell you anything.  No input there.  What if he had a nice PowerPoint presentation for you?  That would be...  It's like, oh, what?  Opens up his laptop.  Now he's showing us everything.  Yeah.  And then, oh, boy.  Could you guys just go to meeting, and I'll sync up with you guys, and I'll show you the  presentation on your own computers there.  This is where your TSL dips.  Fuck, man.  Guy...  He was right.  TSL dips sound delicious, don't they? 
[02:41:00]  Are you going to go rate them?  I should.  Do a review on them?  The consumer?  TSL dips.  They're like bonbons, but it's time spent listening.  I think if you're going to do that phone call, you've got to pick a time when maybe there  is a few shows in a row that were just like, eh.  Yeah, yeah.  But the fact is, the show is really on a swing lately.  Been feeling very good about the product we've been pumping out and jizzing all over the nation.  Right.  My word. 
[02:41:30]  I watched that goddamn Fargo show.  Did it get better?  It didn't get better.  It's been great the whole fucking time.  It is so good.  That fucking show is so goddamn good.  But explain this.  A lot of people have said that it started off slow.  No.  You're not one of those people?  No.  Who are these people?  I don't know.  I've seen it on Twitter and here and there, and they said, you know, a little slow.  I don't think so.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  The first episode had a lot of action. 
[02:42:00]  The second episode introduced some newer characters, and then it just took off from there.  You had to know that there were new characters from the movie.  It wasn't the movie, so people going into it expecting Fargo, the motion picture, might  be like, oh, you know, oh, they're just doing this, that.  You get past that very quickly and realize it's its own show, and then Billy Bob Thornton  is fucking great, and that goddamn Tim from The Office, Freeman, Iraq, dude, he is fan-fucking-tastic. 
[02:42:30]  He's a great actor.  He's a great actor, and his character in this is ruthless, just fucking great.  He's turning into such an asshole now.  I know, it's great.  It's such a good fucking transformation that this, his character's making.  Colin Hanks is in it, and he's fantastic.  It's just, and written and filmed very well.  Bob Odenkirk, too.  Odenkirk is the, yeah, he's like the police chief guy, he's kind of bumbling. 
[02:43:00]  He's in Breaking Bad.  Ah, that's right.  The way they filmed that, um...  Do they make it look cold?  Yes, they do make it look cold.  Are they good at that?  Make it look cold?  Pretty goddamn good.  A few filters, maybe?  Yeah.  You think when they filmed it, it was cold?  I think so.  It looks cold.  Where do they film?  I don't know.  Hawaii.  Oh, wow, that's strange.  A lot of potato flakes.  Yeah, hey, don't throw that pineapple at me, no.  Don't do that, it'll break.  Okay. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  The way they filmed that, in I guess the last episode, the second to last episode that just  showed, there's some shenanigans going on in a building.  And the way it's done, where it's, you never see inside the building.  You just see the windows outside, and the camera's moving about the building as you're  hearing what's going on in the building.  Oh, wow.  And it works so well.  It's such a great, cool way to do that scene.  And, um...  Yeah, I loved it. 
[02:44:00]  There's two episodes left, that's it?  I think so, yeah.  Man.  Even the hunt in the snow.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just blinding.  You could only see right by that person.  And no one knows who they're shooting at and what they're doing.  But it's really good.  It's on demand, so you should definitely watch it.  I have some theories, too, about what's going on and what's going to happen and who's who.  Is that Robert Rodriguez's channel?  No.  No, no.  That's FX.  Yeah.  It's on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Robert Rodriguez channel isn't...  Yeah, I hear about it every so often.  Yeah, I haven't really gotten a buzz on that yet. 
[02:44:30]  Maybe not yet.  Yeah, but it'll probably take a little while.  They need something that just...  Slow growth.  Kind of pops.  Slow growth.  You know what?  Yeah.  Can't find one person to defend us on that last phone call.  No, huh?  Fuck.  Bastards.  You would think one person would call and defend us.  Fuckers.  Fuck.  Fuck.  What happens?  Fuck.  Well, look, I'm guaranteed you guys got fans out there.  Oh, my God.  Absolutely.  I wish one would...  Jimmy just got so mad, he just...  He's got to leave.  He left the studio. 
[02:45:00]  I thought he was going to get up and fart.  He's been known to do that.  Why did he leave the studio, you think?  I don't know.  Probably has to make poopies.  Maybe.  But he was smiling, and he turned the corner the other way.  What do you mean?  It kind of almost looked like he was headed for the control room.  No.  I think he was headed toward the bathroom.  Oh, maybe you're right.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, what's up?  My name's Lyle.  I'm a big fan of the radio show. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, you should be waiting for someone defending us.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I didn't think that was really good with that guy.  I called in and started bashing everybody.  Would you guys make them fart noises?  I fucking laughed my balls off.  You like that one, Lyle?  Fuck, yeah.  That's your favorite part of the show?  Anything else you like about the show?  Nah, that's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  All right.  Well, we got that call for us, which is nice.  I'm talking and someone's like, I'm fucking rolling. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Well, as long as we're making someone happy.  Yeah.  All right.  At least we had someone defend us.  Yeah.  Right.  That's a good part.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  Thanks.  Thanks, Lyle.  Whatever.  Whatever.  It's nice to know.  It is nice to know.  Well, we got one person.  That's it, though.  Yeah.  That's all we need, really.  Think about it.  We can make one person happy.  I'm more worried about the mystery sea monster anyway.  What is that?  It ate a nine-foot great white shark. 
[02:46:30]  Come on.  How do they know this?  Did it fucking hashtag consumer reports or whatever it was?  It's the consumer.  The consumer.  The consumer.  The rock radio on it.  That's right.  There's a monster eating sharks and blueberry cookies in the ocean.  Blueberry cobbler.  Don't forget the cobbler part.  Oh, yeah.  That cobbler.  A huge nine-foot-long great white shark was eaten by an even bigger mystery sea monster.  You can't say mystery sea monster. 
[02:47:00]  Oh.  Researchers had tagged the healthy sharks to track its movements.  As part of a study.  But were shocked when the tracking device washed up on a beach in Australia four months later.  Fuck.  So why is it?  I guess it's a mystery because they didn't see it happen.  Right.  Data.  Couldn't it just come undone or something?  Yeah.  How are they coming to the conclusion that it was eaten by some giant monster?  I'm reading this cold, so I don't know yet. 
[02:47:30]  Data captured on the device showed there was a rapid temperature rise from 46 degrees to 78 degrees Fahrenheit, along with a sudden sharp 1,902-foot plunge.  Oh.  Something took this fucking thing down.  Oh.  1,900 feet.  Ah, that's why they know, huh?  The researchers believe the data proves it was eaten by something much bigger, saying the temperatures recorded indicate that the shark went inside another animal's digestive system. 
[02:48:00]  Oh.  A whale.  And then he shit out the fucking, uh...  Oh.  The transmitter?  The only theory they have so far is that the shark was gobbled up by a colossal, cannibal, great white shark.  Shh.  Well, now, what if it was just another shark that bit it right where the transmitter was...  Yes.  ...and then swallowed that part...  Mm. 
[02:48:30]  ...and then took a dive?  No, the thing had to be in the belly to get all the readings.  Yeah, but just the transmitter.  I think he did shit it out.  Then he shit it out.  He shit it out, or maybe spit it up.  But they're trying to conjure up this image that this giant fish ate the entire 8-foot or 9-foot fish.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  When it could have just taken a bite right where the transmitter is, swallowed just the transmitter.  Oh, yeah.  And then fucking, you know...  All right, a great point.  Yeah.  Great point.  So what dives 1,900 feet into the ocean like that? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I'm guessing a whale.  Scary.  Um, I don't think there are any down by Australian.  The case is detailed in an upcoming documentary by the Smithsonian Institute called The Hunt  For the Super Predator, which draws from an earlier ABC documentary, The Search for the Ocean Super Predator.  Oh, okay.  So they're trying to promo something in there.  When I was first told about the day they came back from the tag that was on the shark, I absolutely was blown away, the filmmaker said.  The question that not only came to my mind, but everyone's mind who was involved was, what did that? 
[02:49:30]  It was obviously eaten.  What's going to eat a shark that big?  But yeah, it's right.  Just the transmitter.  Just that part of the shark.  Who knew if the transmitter fell off and then something ate it as it was, you know, just sitting there.  Right.  I don't know.  That seems silly.  They're trying to make something of it.  They're trying to make a mountain into a something.  A molehill?  Yeah.  Why not an anthill? 
[02:50:00]  A molehill.  Who looks at molehill?  When's the last time you saw a molehill?  I've never seen a molehill.  No, this has an eminence, like mountain and molehill.  Why couldn't they take a fucking mountain and try to make it into an anthill?  Right.  Because you go, I know what an anthill looks like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not a mountain.  How about a hill of beans?  Don't amount to a hill of beans.  Exactly.  There it is.  What are we, on the 20th anniversary of the OJ Bronco chase?  What happened?  It's about right. 
[02:50:30]  OJ's wild ride, 20 years after the chase.  You think they'll just do it in real time?  That'd be fun to watch.  That'd be kind of cool.  Bring you right back.  It's Al Cowling.  I tell you, damn it.  When is the day?  When did the murder go down?  I think in this month, right?  June?  It was June, 20 years ago.  Fuck.  We started doing radio a little after that.  You know, OJ could have gone to prison for the murder and been out.  He would have been so out. 
[02:51:00]  If it would have just been like, well, it wasn't, you know, I was mad.  Yeah.  I'll plea.  I'll plea it down to 20 year sentence.  Be out in 10 or 15?  I'll get out in fucking 10 or 15.  He'd have been out.  Back on TV.  And now he's still in prison.  For something stupid.  For something stupid.  Fucking OJ.  He's been in prison for a while now, too, right?  He's probably been in three or four years by now.  Three years, maybe?  You ain't going to let him out, either.  No, we saw a glimpse of him about a year. 
[02:51:30]  Was that about a year ago?  Yeah, he was asking to get out because of his health.  Right.  I got the arthritis.  Right.  Goddamn, 20 fucking years.  The Bronco chase was on June 17th.  Okay.  But everything else I'm reading is saying the murders were June of 1994.  So I'm trying to find an exact date on the murders.  Yeah, well, it was a couple days later.  That was it, right?  Remember that?  We are actively seeking Mr. Simpson. 
[02:52:00]  All the press in the room was like...  That shit was crazy.  It was insane.  Every day, every hour when it first happened was like, you were fixated on that story.  Right.  If they did do the Bronco chase in real time.  Yeah.  And like younger people that don't know anything about that.  And they just tuned into CNN watching this thing for hours and hours.  Wouldn't know what the fuck is going on.  What is this?  When he pulled his fucking walkie-talkie cell phone out, they'd be like, oh, what happened?  Oh, I get it.  It's old.  It's old stuff.  But the video doesn't look as old anymore. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  We'll have to play with the bars.  But in 94, when you used to see video from 74, it really did old.  It looked old.  Right.  But now you look at something from 94.  I mean, you can tell it's older, of course, but it's not.  But it doesn't look ancient.  No, it really doesn't look old.  Yeah, there is that timeline where all of a sudden video just looks old and then it doesn't anymore.  I would say.  That could be a good.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Sometimes the tone of it looks old.  Or like music videos or there's something about the tone of the nature of it.  It always looks darker.  Like if you watch shows from the 90s and reruns, it always looks darker compared to like what you were saying, like All in the Family and stuff from the 80s.  And it always looks darker in the 90s.  I'm saying darker.  I think because car designs don't change drastically anymore.  Yes.  Because when you see the Bronco, if they show it 20 years later, you're not going to think like, wow, look at that old fucking car.  Yeah.  But in 94, if you saw like cars from 74, there's a drastic difference. 
[02:53:30]  Then it looks a lot different.  Right?  Yeah.  The Bronco's pretty squared off, but that's about it.  Yeah.  But you could still see them out there, too.  Did they stop making them?  Oh, gee.  Why?  I think so.  What?  Yeah.  They did.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I want to make sure we rock again.  Michael in New York.  Michael?  Hello.  Hello.  How are you guys doing?  We need to do this, guys.  Michael.  Go ahead, Michael.  He's dead or alive.  Do it, Michael.  Do it.  You guys have covered so much information from this, but I think I can keep up with all of it. 
[02:54:00]  First off, I want to talk about the caller that called in and tried to give some hash, air quotes, constructive criticism that was worthless.  Lyle was good.  Lyle was good, though.  He likes the show.  Yeah, Lyle was good.  You know, the last one, it was kind of ridiculous.  Like, hey, you need to fix this, but didn't really say anything to fix.  First off, it's a talk show, and you guys do really good at talking, so you got that going for you.  That's amazing.  Which is nice.  I'm kind of awesome at that.  So I think we're back to rocking.  I would say we're back to rocking.  That's good. 
[02:54:30]  You guys are awesome.  What about me personally, though?  Me personally.  I need to hear a little something.  I think your amazingness is what ate that shark.  That's right.  You ate the shark.  Yay!  There you go.  So we got, what, 70% of the ocean's been completely undiscovered, so of course there's something out there that could have eaten a shark.  Don't we know the big ones?  Of course.  When they say, that used to freak me out, too, but the shit they don't know is, like, who gives a fuck stuff, right?  Not the big ones, the big monsters. 
[02:55:00]  We know all the big monsters, don't we?  Yes.  We don't.  They're our listeners.  We're talking about a completely, it's all been seismographed, so they can tell how deep the ocean is in certain parts.  But discovered as far as man going there, no.  No, there's things in the ocean.  It's a completely different environment in the ocean.  Yeah, but it's all that weird.  The ones we haven't discovered is all that weird shit, where their eyes are, like, giant on tiny bodies because there's no light down there.  Yeah, creepy.  And you can see through them for whatever reason. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, I don't know why.  Right.  Like that giant thing in Waterworld.  Sam, could you show us some strange...  Show us some strange.  Some strange.  Some underwater creatures.  The strange ones, though.  I don't know how you get there.  Like, maybe the top 10 strange ocean creatures.  Let's try that.  Oh, man.  And then going to the OJ, the anniversary for OJ, things will be a lot different these days.  We got to go now because the first one is so fucking creepy.  I don't know what that is.  Thank you, Michael. 
[02:56:00]  Call back, though, please.  That's a monster.  All right, here you go.  It's off cracked.com.  Gets the plug today.  The fish that looks like the predator.  Where the fuck is that?  His mouth opens up sideways.  Right.  That just looks like a dumb fish.  Is it at the bottom of the ocean?  That's not a bottom of the ocean one.  It looks sort of like a sea robin with a giant flappy mouth.  Giant flappy vagina mouth.  Right.  On like a sea robin.  The teeth where the clipper picks.  Give me number nine. 
[02:56:30]  Number nine.  Number nine.  Number nine.  What the fuck is that?  How do you even describe that?  That is the Venus fly trap of the sea.  Yeah.  How do you describe that?  It's like a jellyfish.  Kind of.  It's see-through and it looks like a see-through cobra head.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Right.  Yep.  All right.  Number eight.  Oh, what the fuck is that?  Is it buried in sand?  The fish that kills from below. 
[02:57:00]  What?  Wow.  I can't even describe it.  It's just a monster.  Would you freak out if you saw-  Oh, man.  I imagine you're swimming near the bottom and that thing stares at you.  It looks-  Your dick was dragging.  Oh.  Ow.  What does that look like?  Hold on.  We can't just move on from that one.  That is-  Explain that one, Sam.  It looks-  It stays buried in the sand so you only see its face.  Right.  And it has big googly eyes.  Right.  What looks like a starfish on its head.  Right.  And then big, sharp teeth that look like the pit in Star Wars. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, it's very good.  Yeah, it looks like a zipper, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would think that was a human skull with the eyes still in it if you saw it quickly.  Beep.  Look at the whole body.  It's like its face is on top of its head so that way it can be buried in the sand.  I don't like it.  Now, what is it called?  One bit.  It's called the Northern Stargazer.  How big is it?  Big enough to do some damage.  You can't do any stargazing if you're at the bottom.  No.  It's just because he's dumb and looks up all the time. 
[02:58:00]  Salt water in his eyes.  He's not seeing any stars.  Imagine if he was buried in the sand and then you just put your feet in the shallow end  and then he nipped at your toes.  Yeah, he pulled your toe skin.  Fuck out.  I think I'm making the move to water shoes this year.  I love going to the beach and stuff.  But I think I'm finally done with my little tootsies feeling around in the water.  No, no.  You got to put on those scuba booties.  You got to, right?  Yeah.  I leave my Tevas on when I go in the water.  Do you?  Yeah.  Tevas.  There's those mandals.  You're just crunching everything. 
[02:58:30]  Sam just crunches everything as he goes in and out of the water.  Mandals are awful.  Yeah.  They're bad.  I'd rather wear heels in the fucking ocean.  Go right through a horseshoe crab.  I had enough of this dumb fish.  What else?  Why?  Whoa.  I don't know what that is.  What is that?  It's a shark that looks like a throw rug.  Oh, no.  That's pretty fucked up.  It's a carpet shark.  Whoa, you see it?  Eating the other shark thing?  Eating some other shark.  Maybe it was a giant carpet shark.  Where are these fishes?  It looks like flat moss.  A carpet shark is right. 
[02:59:00]  The end table fish.  The carpet shark.  The only thing that can kill him is the couch whale.  Oh, let's see.  Terrible.  All right.  Weak improv.  The 56-foot long fish.  That might be the Loch Ness, though, right?  That might be a little Loch Ness, actually.  Yeah, could be.  It's a giant oar fish.  It looks like an eel.  Or what?  Yeah, exactly.  And his sexual behavior is irrelevant. 
[02:59:30]  Five.  The real...  Kraken, like release the kraken?  Right.  Oh, man.  All right.  We should put this on our Facebook page.  Kraken.  The world's biggest fish.  Whoa.  What's the world's biggest fish?  I think it has a sunfish.  It's like a fish that's the size of a whale, but it's a fish.  That thing could eat you.  Oh, wow.  That's a fish?  Look at that little...  You can bite people?  That's crazy.  Unless it's right by the lens and the diver's like way far away.  A little forced perspective?  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Is there video?  There's video of all these fishes.  They have a video of that one, Sam?  It's a mola mola.  What's that?  Or ocean sunfish.  And it's the heaviest fish in the world.  What does it taste like, though?  Damn.  Tastes like chicken.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  That is big.  Three is the fish that walks.  Get the fuck out of here.  Is that a monkey fish?  This is one of nine new specimens of hand fish that were recently discovered near Tasmania. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my gosh.  They have limbs and everything.  Wow.  You got a video of it walking?  Some wacky shit going on with that fish.  Look at that fish.  All right.  It's crawling.  What the fuck?  What would you think if you saw that?  Well, I would think that in a million years.  And why don't they go the distance and stay on land like everything else that fucking walked  out of the ocean?  Because a few million years, that's what's going to happen there.  It's going to make a whole new type of people.  Whoa.  That fishes?  Yeah.  Shit. 
[03:01:00]  It's going to figure out how to get out of there and walk around.  Because it can walk and it has gills.  Yep.  All right.  That's it.  Like Kevin Costner in Waterworld.  Waterworld.  Behind his ears, he had those vagina gills.  Perfect.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  I saw part of that.  It looked stupid.  I hate this fucking hair tie.  Like his hair tie?  I hate the rubber band in his hair.  I'm so sick of that look to imply future.  Long hair with a little piece tied off like a Kung Fu master.  That's because he wanted to cover up his baldness in the water.  I heard that a lot of money went to, in post-production, to covering up his bald spot because his hair 
[03:01:30]  was wet a lot in it.  And wet hair, you know, makes it a lot easier to see.  It gives their world a hurt.  So, I think, in post, they had to fill in his hair.  You know, cost a lot of money.  Took over.  The movie was so bad.  Took up most of the budget, you think?  It was, I call Waterworld wet postman.  Ah.  And I called Postman dry Waterworld.  Ah.  Yeah.  Perfect.  What about Dennis Hopper and his eye patch? 
[03:02:00]  He was just like the other guy, the copy machine repairman from the postman.  Oh.  Same thing.  Did you know Rue McClanahan died?  No.  When?  I didn't either.  A couple days ago, yes.  Who's that?  From the Golden Girls.  The whore from Golden Girls.  You know, the old one.  Just stroke.  Trying to get fucked.  June 3rd in New York.  Damn.  Why the hell?  They're not doing much on her dying.  No.  I didn't know.  Are we done with the Golden Girls now?  Are they all dead?  No.  Betty White.  Betty White still.  Rue McClanahan died in 2010. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, did she?  I'm sorry.  Thank you for the breaking news.  No, I'll tell you why.  Wait a minute.  We're only four years off on that one.  Jimmy!  Somebody quitted something and I was looking at it and I Googled her and it just said June  3rd.  I didn't realize it was 2010.  I was off for a few years.  Boy, they're not doing anything with that death four years later.  I thought I remembered that she died, but I'm like, oh, maybe that was B.  I just still.  Holy shit.  I'm a bit of a shock that they didn't celebrate her four-year death anniversary with something 
[03:03:00]  spectacular.  I just figure they were all dead by now and most of them.  Of course.  Betty White.  Of course, Betty White.  Betty White.  What about the mother?  The old...  Estelle Getty?  Estelle Getty.  Yeah.  She was...  She died making interracial porn.  Oh, fuck.  Not a way to go out.  She's still alive, right?  Oh, no.  Breaking news.  Yeah.  She died July 22nd, 2008.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I thought she was still alive.  Stop or my mom will shoot.  Oh, was that her?  Yes.  Oh, she was in there. 
[03:03:30]  That's right.  Hey, can we...  I got to see the number one sea monster.  Well, you're only at three.  No.  Let's do this quick.  The number one sea monster?  Let's see what her name is.  The fish that looks like...  A xenomorph.  How would you know what a xenomorph looks like?  It's a black dragon fish.  Right.  And it lives deep in the ocean where light can't reach it.  But it has a strategy for seeking out its unlucky prey.  The body admits...  It goes...  An infrared light that only it can see. 
[03:04:00]  What?  How did I figure that out?  Meaning that it's basically wearing a pair of night vision goggles.  What?  Everything else is swimming around blindly.  How do they eat?  They get eaten.  They get eaten something.  Right.  Enough of them have to survive to keep their species going.  That's terrifying.  That is an unfair advantage.  For sure.  But how do the other ones protect themselves?  That's why it's so fucked up.  Whoa.  Mm-hmm.  They can find food, but they can't fucking see this glow-in-the-dark sea fish fucking buzzing along. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, no.  The number one is the clam that looks like a dick.  Oh, no.  The Sam clam.  Sorry, Sam.  How dare you?  You guys had to eat that shit.  The gooey duck.  Yeah, it's the gooey duck.  The gooey duck.  When we had our boiled meat episode.  I don't think I liked it.  I don't think it was for me.  Mm-hmm.  No.  The gooey duck.  The clam that looks like a dick.  Yeah, exactly.  To die after looking for dropped cell phone and toilet. 
[03:05:00]  Where did this happen?  I'm sure it was somewhere far away.  China.  Yep.  China?  China?  It happened in China.  A man and his mother have suffocated after trying to fish a mobile phone out of an open pit toilet and falling in.  An open pit toilet.  Did you eat any of that at the barbecue?  The open pit toilet.  Yeah, there's a ladle that hangs inside.  You just scoop a little bit of liquid shit out and you dump it on some bread.  The bread they store in the urinal in the border china. 
[03:05:30]  Some rolls.  That's terrible.  South China Morning Post reports that an unnamed woman in Chang'an City, China, dropped her phone worth about $320 into the open pit toilet.  Jeez, that's a lot of money.  Why would you want to use that after?  Who wants to make a phone call with a duty phone?  Yeah.  They're being nice.  It's just a hole in the ground.  Yeah.  Open pit toilet.  It's just a hole in the ground.  They squat over it.  Disgusting.  We got lazy and decided to build a toilet so we don't have to squat like that. 
[03:06:00]  Her husband tried to find it but was overcome by the stench, lost consciousness, and fell in.  So how do you, what do you, poke around a little bit?  Did he reach all the way in with his arm?  I guess he tried to lean into the hole there and fish it out.  Oh my God.  The fumes got him.  His mother then dove in after her son.  Oh man. 
[03:06:30]  Is it alright to laugh at this?  Of course it is.  Are you sure?  Yes.  It's far enough away.  Did he die fishing a toilet out of a shit pile?  A toilet out of a shit pile?  Well, a phone out of a shit pile.  But she dove in.  Dove in.  Alright, mom.  She also fainted.  Neighbors were called for help after the owner of the phone then tried to save her husband  and mother-in-law but also lost consciousness.  So now you got three people in the shit pile.  Fuck.  A total of six people had to be.  New name for our show. 
[03:07:00]  What?  Three people in the shit pile.  I like it.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  A total of six people had to be pulled out of the toilet.  In the end, there were six people down there.  The man and his mother both had pulses when they were rescued but died as they waited more  than an hour for medical assistance to arrive.  That's great.  Two lives have gone in five minutes and my cousin's wife is still in a coma.  You're going into a coma.  Leaving a partially paralyzed old man and a one-year-old son at home, the husband's uncle 
[03:07:30]  said, according to Shanghai.  Chang-fang.  What are we supposed to do?  It's just how the Oracle ends.  What are we supposed to do?  There's a weird situation over there in China.  Why?  Now they got like these areas that are completely modern and, you know, they got good medical  attention, factories and shit like that.  And then there's areas where they might as well be living in the old Ming dynasty. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  It's real.  You talk about wealth separation.  Holy moly.  It's crazy over there.  So, here you go.  I like going over there, though, and visiting.  Someone almost got me on Twitter.  What's up?  Someone just wrote, Paul Newman died.  Oh, my God.  I almost reported it.  I'm like, oh, wait a minute.  I swear.  I already knew that.  That was quite a while ago.  You almost already knew that.  No, I knew that.  You had to think for a second. 
[03:08:30]  I forgot.  Yeah, exactly.  You had to think.  They're going to get you now.  Your aunt's view of the world is just by visiting Epcot.  Yeah, that's true.  I will say that is very true.  I don't know.  I don't know much about that.  We've heard the stories coming out of China to know that it's a little bit different than  what we're used to.  You know what I know about China from Epcot?  You stand in front of the restaurant.  Right.  And then little Chinese kids come out and do juggling and acrobatics.  And then you go in and you eat and you come out and then you go to Mexico. 
[03:09:00]  Isn't that kind of racist, though?  No, it's great.  It's a bit racist.  Those little Chinese kids are real bendy.  They could bend.  But they're celebrating their culture.  Yeah, yeah.  That's racist.  No.  Is it?  Yeah, you can't celebrate your culture anymore.  It's racist.  If you're white, you can't.  How'd that Puerto Rican Day parade go?  Pretty good?  Yeah.  All without a hitch?  No wilding?  I think so.  That's good.  I saw the...  I didn't see anything in the papers.  De Blasio doing some Latin dancing.  I hate him.  I don't like him. 
[03:09:30]  He was marching in the parade.  He did a little dance.  Good for him.  Made a little love.  Got down tonight.  Oh, was that the song?  No.  It was some Spanish song.  I'm sure.  But a couple of people I knew, a couple of the boys on the jab, said that it was relatively  quiet.  A lot of hoochie mamas.  Yeah.  You know?  Women.  Puerto Rican women love dressing provocatively during the Puerto Rican Day parade.  Well, it's...  Yes. 
[03:10:00]  What's this?  Holy shit.  Was that Kornikova?  What?  Anna Kornikova?  Did Anna Kornikova just walk by?  Oh, in here?  Yes.  Whoa.  Went toward Troy's studio.  Oh, shit.  She's probably looking for me.  She's a big Boneyard fan.  You best check that out.  She still looks amazing if that was her.  Was it her?  Someone that looks like her.  No, the other way, Sammy.  Oh, is he just going on?  Oh, Sam. 
[03:10:30]  Look at how he walks with his dumb feet.  His dumb feet.  His dumb orthotic eating tootsies.  Oh, my God.  He walks with a slant to the left, doesn't he?  Oh.  Right?  Look at...  Yeah.  He's walking back.  He's walking back and he sees we're looking at him now, so he's all nervous.  And he knows we're laughing at his dumb feet.  There he comes.  He didn't do anything, though.  He walked halfway down the hall and came back.  I don't think his pants go... 
[03:11:00]  No.  There's too much space.  Too much space.  He doesn't get that...  He looks like a cowboy.  No word on if that was Anna Kornikova?  Sure looked like her.  Was it?  Why are you laughing?  Oh, God.  What?  He's an intern.  The blonde?  Yep.  She looks like Anna Kornikova.  Is she one of our interns?  No.  No.  Of course not.  The girl from the middle black is here, too.  No.  I found her.  She's not here now. 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  All right.  So no Anna Kornikova.  Back to the Puerto Rican day parade.  I want to know about the intern that looks like Anna Kornikova now, though.  Yeah, no kidding.  Anna Kornikova.  Who does she work for?  Get her back here.  Jenny Hutt.  Really?  She works for Jenny Hutt.  Did you see Jenny Hutt's tweets over the weekend?  Were they needy thanking celebrities for things?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Is she needy?  She tweeted Rosie O'Donnell, I think it was.  Was Rosie O'Donnell part of the Tonys?  Tonys, yeah.  She accepted an award, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  She was wishing her good luck.  And I'm sitting there like...  Oh, boy.  Rosie O'Donnell's not reading Jenny Hutt's Twitter.  You know what?  A lot of these celebrities do, and they retweet her compliments.  Who?  Jenny?  Certain celebrities, yeah.  All right.  Word it.  Oh, boy.  She's reaching out to E-Rock saying, I'll bake chocolate chip cookies for you guys.  Oh.  I didn't know your show was into eating cookies.  Well, no.  It's just...  E-Rock is... 
[03:12:30]  I'll reveal.  Get the Rosie O'Donnell one.  She tweets a lot.  Most of them are like, look at me, look at me tweets.  Those are her tweets.  It's her thing.  Look at me.  Everyone has their thing on Twitter.  Look at me.  I know this person.  It's her thing.  Look at me.  She's needy?  It is.  Some call me needy, she says, which is defined as requiring attention beyond what is normative. 
[03:13:00]  Isn't that everyone on Twitter?  Yeah, but normative becomes the norm of Twitter.  Right.  If you're needy on Twitter, then you're really, really needy.  She's above the normative.  Yes, the normative.  Oh, boy.  What?  Hey, Rosie.  Hey, at Rosie.  Have fun tonight.  Hashtag Tony Awards.  You deserve this honor.  Excited to watch.  Hashtag what will you wear?  XO. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, fucking awful.  Wow.  So what did Rosie say back?  Let me open it up.  Get some replies.  Oh, there's...  Looking for some replies.  There's no replies there.  Nothing.  It did get one...  It did get favorited.  By herself.  She favorited her own.  One favorite?  Yes, somebody named Andrew S. favorited it.  All right.  Wow.  That's nice.  One person favorited it.  Hey, Rosie, what you wearing? 
[03:14:00]  Any other Tony...  Or needy tweets?  Yeah.  Let's just go with needy.  Generally, go Tony Awards.  All right.  Go...  Go current from there.  Anything after that she tweeted.  Let's see.  You're going the wrong way.  Go up.  No?  Go back more recent?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go listen.  Yeah, we already looked at those.  Yeah.  There's no neediness in those?  No.  I mean, she's talking about her brother and stuff.  Right.  Okay.  But she's now going to bake us cookies.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  What is that one?  Hey...  Oh.  I don't want a cookie with...  Unless there's a nice red pube in it.  Hey, we're making a vibe.  Say hey.  Hi!  Oh, my gosh.  It's camera does.  Is that a boy band?  Yeah.  Which boy band is that?  I don't know.  Who's the grandma in the video?  That's...  Oh, no.  It's Jenny.  Oh, fuck.  It's Jenny in the video.  Shit.  Sorry, Jenny.  It's Jenny Hut.  I guess it's just because they're so young.  I got a confused.  Oh, no.  Okay, here's a meaty one.  What?  It's called Guess I'm Not a Milf. 
[03:15:00]  There she is, out the window.  Hi, Jenny.  Hold on, microphone.  Are you tweeting me?  Are you...  Why are you here?  ...and half hours of fucking traffic.  And the intern...  The intern is my cousin.  Nice.  How old is she?  She's my first cousin's daughter.  Does she look like Anna Kornikova?  She's adorable.  How old is she?  She's Joanna.  She's 20.  Okay, so a little old, but I mean...  I don't even have a show to do right now.  I just have Dog and Beth.  We want to know...  What?  What?  Dog and Beth. 
[03:15:30]  What's that?  Dog, the bounty hunter, and Beth, the...  How come we didn't get Dog?  We put in for Dog.  He's here.  Oh, that's my daughter in that video that you have on the Vine.  Wait, what is the...  I can't hear what you're saying in your Vine video.  Yeah, that was on the Long Island Road the other day.  That's fine.  My daughter was upset with me.  Your daughter's pulling up your cleavage?  She said you're not a MILF.  She's covering up your cleavage.  Not a MILF.  That's the audio that you guys aren't hearing.  No, you're definitely a MILF.  You're a MILF.  Anyway, hi. 
[03:16:00]  And then I was listening to you guys.  What does the G stand for?  In the...  Grandma.  Oh.  Bumper to bumper granny.  Oh, man.  Great.  That's the official word.  Did Rosie reply to you?  No, Rosie and I are really friends in real life.  Tell.  So why don't you just text her that?  I do.  Why does the whole world have to know?  I wanted everyone to know that she got an honor.  Oh, shut up.  How come she didn't get back to you?  Guys, I don't even have a sense of humor anymore.  Yes, we texted on the cell phone.  Prove it.  Give me a sense of humor.  Good luck tonight. 
[03:16:30]  It's gone.  Who's this?  Fucking L.I.  Who's this?  Jenny.  Stop.  Prove that Rosie texted you.  Okay.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  So I don't know.  Did I speak to her last night?  Did I speak to her a day ago?  I'll tell you when I was in.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  I'm going to find it.  Because you could give us a nice face today.  Huh?  What?  You could give us a face.  Like, see, face.  I am friends with her.  I really am friends.  Okay.  I'll text her right now.  Oh.  Oh, that means you don't have any text messages from Rosie.  No, no.  I deleted it.  Now you're reaching. 
[03:17:00]  Hi.  Desperated it.  Text back.  Why would you delete?  Nobody deletes texts.  What do you mean?  You don't delete texts?  No.  I'm going to jerk off to them.  You guys are so full of baloney.  From Rosie?  What's she going to say?  Anyway, I said to Iraq earlier, I'd be happy to bake cookies for you on the air.  Cookies.  Yeah.  But then he said you hate food.  So then we don't want to eat cookies.  We hate food.  No, we're trying to eat well.  Well, no.  You guys have definitely taken a stand against food segments as well.  Oh, we have.  All food segments are empty.  You know, because you used to have the pounds packed on you there, Jane. 
[03:17:30]  It's so bad.  Yeah.  So, you know what it's like to have to maybe cut back a little.  We see it, Chubby.  That's where I am right now, trying to cut back a little.  It's awful.  Chubbs.  Oh, yeah?  What was the real world?  The Chubbs?  Chubbs.  She called her Chubbs.  What's that?  No, what was the line, though?  We all see it, Chubbs.  No, fuck.  What was the line?  It was a great line.  You said we all see it, though.  We all see it.  I remember that one.  I called her Chubbs, I think.  I'm so annoyed that I did.  Do you have a problem, like, keeping weight down off of you?  Yeah, it's hell.  It's awful.  Every day of my life.  Every day, you've got to.  Yeah, on a scale every morning. 
[03:18:00]  Well, just eat oatmeal or something.  Just eat oatmeal, Opie?  That's what I do.  What is it you want to eat that you can't?  Well, pizza.  I love pizza.  Oh, I love a good piece of pizza.  It's pizza good.  You can't do it, though.  Well, no, I don't now.  But you guys know the story.  Don't you know the story of the pizza that I had?  You look TV-ready today.  I'm not.  I just have makeup now.  You're TV-ready.  I have meetings and stuff.  You are.  Meetings with who?  Trying to get an extra hundred bucks from this place?  Yes!  Good luck there.  Not for here.  No, no, no, no.  Good luck with that one, Jenny. 
[03:18:30]  They don't feel like paying anyone around here.  It's okay.  You guys make money.  That's good.  We do all right.  It matters.  That's true.  We do all right.  You keep me company on the treadmill, though, most mornings.  Thank you.  You're crowded up there, then.  6.30 in the morning.  Not in real life, Ants.  Oh, see, I thought.  You do burst trading?  I'm trying to now.  But how many seconds are you supposed to really?  Three seconds, five-minute rest.  That's not true, Jim.  60 seconds, 80% of your...  Maximum heart rate?  I believe.  Somewhere around there. 
[03:19:00]  Do you wear a heart rate monitor?  Hell no.  I just grabbed your vein under my dick.  Yeah.  I feel it bouncing, and I count.  Take your pulse off of your ball bag.  Yeah, my Vaz Deverns.  If that's pumping, I know I'm pushing my heart rate.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Iraq does burst training on his pants button.  Because it's ready to burst.  The consumer.  Hashtag the consumer.  Yep.  Did Debra Messing get back to you?  Why are you going down my...  Debra Messing?  Here's the thing. 
[03:19:30]  On Twitter, I try to book guests on Twitter, because I can't really affect people.  I'm going to turn your mic off.  I'm going to turn your mic off.  What did Debra Messing say about you?  Let Sam talk.  No, Debra Messing, I met her at CNN, and she was like, oh, I'm a fan, and blah, blah,  blah, but I guess not really, because she didn't respond to me.  Most people that say they're a fan aren't a fan.  It doesn't make her a bitch.  I guess she just didn't really care.  It makes her a bitch.  No, I mean, whatever.  People say things.  Most celebrities that tell us they're fans, we know it's bullshit.  You just go, oh, man.  I tell people at their word some of the time.  There's a couple that we believe are true fans, but the rest of them are lying. 
[03:20:00]  What did she say to Debra?  I wanted her to do my radio show.  Hold on, literally.  She got a skinny on the Twitter.  She said, hang on, I clicked on, Dr. Drew doesn't text her and tweet her back either.  He does, too.  He does.  And he did.  He's had it with you.  He's done.  He's done.  He does.  The one I tweeted to him, he did tweet back.  He used to be your boy.  How much do you want to bet?  The one from this weekend about Narcon, or like last week about Narcon, he totally did.  I was just looking at one, he didn't do it.  No, he just had it with you. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, boy.  She tweeted, she wrote, hey, Debra Messing.  All right, you guys, I am so emotionally messed up today.  I'm going to turn your mic off.  Wait, what did she say?  She wrote, hey, Debra Messing, want to be on my SiriusXM show to talk the mysteries  of Laura and hashtag dieting?  Follow to DM to set it up.  Fun.  There you go.  No one else is going to book people for me.  What should I do?  Did she follow you?  So what happened when she followed you?  Did she follow you?  No.  So now what I did?  Nothing I can do.  Whenever someone says follow me, I don't do it. 
[03:21:00]  You should get a public email.  Guys, you know what?  You don't have to tell me I'm a loser.  I already feel like a loser.  It's not that you're a loser, but you don't say follow the DMs.  I think you have more to offer, and you don't need to be as needy.  She wrote to Dr. Drew.  She wrote, hey, Dr. Drew, New York City police will start carrying naloxone.  He replied.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  Great idea, right?  He 100% did.  All right, let's see the reply.  He did.  Well, there's a reply from...  He might have deleted it, but he did.  I swear to God. 
[03:21:30]  No one deletes their tweet reply?  I swear to you.  He said it was a great idea.  He said, absolutely.  Why?  What, did he drop the N-bomb in it?  Yeah.  Did he think you were Jenny McCarthy and he realized, oh, wrong reply?  Let me ask you guys a bit.  Who can help me?  This is Dr. Glenn, not Dr. Drew.  It's a guy named Glenn.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Dr. Glenn replied to you.  Not Dr. Drew.  Oh, no.  It wasn't Dr. Drew.  Guys, I wouldn't say you did if it didn't.  Debra Messing definitely did not.  Yeah, neither did it, or Rosie.  I also had Christy Alley.  She said she was scared of me because it says I'm a lawyer in my bio, and so she won't  do my show.  Oh, boy. 
[03:22:00]  And nothing from Dr. Drew.  She's scared of a lawyer.  Yeah, that's what it is.  So why is she scared that you're a lawyer?  I have no idea.  She's afraid you're representing her scale?  I don't know.  Fucking monster.  I was going to have her on to...  Oh, wow.  It's a storm.  Oh, shit.  Anyway.  Wow.  Anyway.  So what's the rest of the day look like?  I'm going to interview Dog, the bounty hunter, and his wife, Beth, and air that tomorrow  because I couldn't have them on live today.  We'll keep them away from shade.  And then Tay Diggs is coming in as well.  Tay Diggs?  Oh, Tay Diggs.  Oh, yeah.  We say no to him every time. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  He went to Syracuse.  Huh?  He's the pride of Syracuse University's acting program.  My sister weren't there, too.  But not in those days.  I miss Fat Mommy.  She was nicer.  That's what my daughter said.  She says to you?  She said it the other day.  No.  Oh, man.  So you're getting it from all sides, not just your radio pals.  That's right.  You get it at home as well.  I do.  I am low woman on every total of us.  No, you're not.  We just fuck her out.  Does skinny mommy, does she flirt with some of your daughters?  Does she flirt with her friends? 
[03:23:00]  Me?  Do I flirt with my kids?  What are you, crazy?  You're skinny mommy.  You're just so near.  No, that's disgusting.  I just have children.  That's maybe why she doesn't bring out some drinks to the pool when she's having a party  in a little bikini.  Hi, everyone.  Jenny comes out.  She's going, I'm just going to sun with you, young people.  And she goes, I'm not like most moms.  I'm a cool mom.  Yeah, I'm a cool mom.  I have a 15-year-old son also.  I show up to school like a scrub.  Is there one boy that's kind of made you a little moist when they come to your house? 
[03:23:30]  I guarantee you.  Do you know what the teenage boys are the grossest creatures on the planet?  Is there one that just got things going a little bit downstairs?  Yeah, all of them.  You didn't expect it.  Oh, please.  She's the one who comes out with drinks and she goes, well, if you're going to drink,  I'd rather you do it under my room.  Thank you, Mrs. Hunt.  Next thing you know.  Oh, man.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  Give us some differences between Skinny Mommy and what was the other one called? 
[03:24:00]  Fat Mommy.  Fat Mommy.  Big Fat Mommy.  What's the difference?  What would Fat Mommy do and Skinny Mommy do?  I think I was more cuddly.  And I think I was, yeah.  I was not as verbally strong.  Get your arms around her.  Oh, it's awkward.  Yeah, right?  They know the arms aren't going around the back.  Well, they liked that I was cushy.  Oh, man.  But who else would, though?  It's like, oh, thanks, kids. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, you like me fat, but a man doesn't.  No, I mean, there was no problem.  I mean, I, yeah.  I've told you guys.  I think my husband misses that, like, I had a very big tushy.  Oh, a feeder.  And my boobs are very big.  Then he's a feeder.  Stay away.  Be careful.  A feeder?  By the way, we're married 17 years.  A chaser?  Thursday.  No, a feeder.  They just feed their women to keep them fat so they don't leave them.  Oh, right, right, right.  You got to watch.  No.  No.  Oh, yeah.  They'll be as happy if I'll eat French fries with them.  I like your ass in those pants. 
[03:25:00]  What are they, Muppet pants?  They're Sesame Street.  Sesame Street pants?  I was going to wear a sundress, but the weather, it's like fucking winter here.  What do you do with that?  We had a perfect weekend.  What are you talking about?  Yesterday I went running.  I ran three miles.  Can I put my Oscar in your garbage can?  Yeah, it's funny.  Oh, wow.  Here's another one.  Put your snuffle off the place in her Gordon mouth.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Now knock it off.  Jenny, what?  Sam.  This one is too.  Hold on, Sam.  Yes.  You were running yesterday?  Yes.  What celebrity were you running after? 
[03:25:30]  Oh, God.  I'll be for the win.  Well done.  Well, Todd was a little bad, but I still got it in.  Hey, Anthony Cumia.  I thought of you this morning while I was talking about Mark Cuban on my show.  Should have had you call in.  Arrgh.  Next time.  Oh, man.  I should have.  I missed your opportunity, Ant.  It was true, though.  I was.  I missed the opportunity.  I didn't think Mark Cuban did anything at all.  It's weird that you guys sound disappointed, because remember that time I told you guys  you should stick around and do a Jenny Hot show? 
[03:26:00]  You know what?  Oh, yeah.  And you guys were just like, oh, we have that thing where we have to go home now.  Did I leave that cartoon smoke when I ran out of the...  Yes, you did.  You did?  Yes.  I did try to get him to stay, Jenny.  I'm very busy.  I just like you guys to know that any day that I'm here, you have an open invitation at  the end of your show to walk down the hall and be on my show.  That's it.  Cool.  Do you like to be on my show next Monday?  I'll take her out for a nice meal.  It's your cousin.  That's not why I was my cousin.  Why not?  I'm a good date.  Because she's my first cousin's daughter.  I'm a gentlemanly date.  Would you bang her?  Not on the first date. 
[03:26:30]  I don't try.  I'm very gentlemanly.  Good for you.  Actually, yeah, I've heard that you're a nice guy in that way.  I am.  However, no.  Who's talking?  She's a little young.  Who's talking to tell you that shit?  20.  She's old enough to go to jail.  She's old enough to go out and have a fine van.  20's fine.  She might have a boyfriend.  I'll find out today.  All right.  Of course she does.  Any other needy tweets?  Not as needy lately.  I'm proud of you, Jenny Hunt.  Sam's got to go a long way to find the bad ones.  Well, she was just sending love you messages to Carney Wilson.  I'm not allowed to live and breathe on Twitter with you guys again in so much trouble. 
[03:27:00]  I love you, Carney.  Keep it up.  But you would text those people.  I like all of it.  I like the whole thing.  Love social media.  Oh, man.  That's what Carney said back.  How many pies did you two share back in the day?  Oh, man.  How long have you known Carney?  You knew her in your chubby days?  Yeah, I knew her when I was a fan, when I was fat, when I was fat.  Did she resent you?  Yeah.  Because you got skinny?  Your interview with Lea Michele is online?  Yeah, it's really ugly. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, apparently.  Lea Michele hates me so much.  That girl, Lea Michele from Glee?  Yeah.  Apparently, she was horrible with Jenny.  Why?  Hated me.  Just walked in.  Wow.  Hated me.  I get that.  Yeah.  Fuck her.  Yeah.  Now I want to defend her.  See, that's where you've got to learn a little more, Sam.  Because now I want to fucking...  My claws are going to come out.  Why?  You want to attack her?  What do you want from us?  No, no.  Don't.  Don't.  No.  No.  Fuckers, you're just like, there's another Target.  No, fucker, no.  Stop it.  Can you put the camera down, please?  It's rude.  It's mean.  What? 
[03:28:00]  You love getting your picture taken.  Not now at all, because I'm not.  No.  Oh, my God.  You're staring and yelling.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got one.  Got a few good ones?  Fucker.  That Ariana Mike flag.  I'm not putting ugly one on, please.  It's mean.  I would never.  Yeah.  What?  I'm assuming is Joan Grande Ariana Grande's mom?  Yes.  I met Ariana Grande.  I took my kids to her house.  That Ariana Grande really is special and sweet.  Hi, Joan Grande.  You must be beaming.  Did she ever write your back?  Hashtag BBMAs.  No, she did not write me back, but I can't text Ariana Grande's mom, but I did take my 
[03:28:30]  kids to Ariana Grande's house.  Why did that girl like you?  The Michelle.  She hated me.  For what reason?  No, she didn't like me.  Well, I think I called her young, and that might have set her off, or I called her a kid,  or said something.  Yeah, but comparatively.  But she was really angry.  How old is she?  I was being complimentary.  Like, she's young, and she's accomplished so much.  How old is she?  And she, whatever.  So did you back off, or did you grovel?  No, I was, no, I just kept asking her questions about her book, and I said things like, so  what are some of your favorite recipes?  And she's like, they're in my book.  Oh, I hate when people that have a book say that. 
[03:29:00]  So what?  It's like, oh, it's in my book.  It's like, what the fuck are you here?  So why don't we get a clip of this?  Go ahead.  What advice could you give young girls who want to follow your career path?  They should read my book.  Read my book.  So why don't we get a clip of that?  It's more show, Sam.  Tell her she stunk in the interview.  Easy, fucking bitch.  Because her publicist was right there.  Fuck her publicist.  And I got nervous, and I was dry in the mouth.  It was awful.  She just wants to be liked.  You were dry in the where?  The mouth.  Oh, I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I still get my period.  Aw. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, no.  Well, he was implying that there was vaginal dryness.  I didn't know where the dryness was.  I don't mind it either, Jenny.  If you're on the rag, I will still fucking pound.  Will you really?  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't care.  I just want to do karaoke with you.  Yeah.  Can you just arrange that?  Come on down.  We'll do a duet.  I got a mic you can sing into.  I hate that blood, that dry fucking non-vistus lube.  It just feels wrong.  Bye.  It just feels wrong.  It's kind of cloddy.  Yeah.  She loves Joy Behar, too, but Joy Behar didn't. 
[03:30:00]  I love all of you.  Did Joy Behar reply to you?  No, she didn't reply.  No, what was that one?  She didn't get to reply.  There she goes.  What was that one?  You know how Waltz's dick must have felt in that bed?  Fucking.  Yeah.  A lot of blood.  No reply on that one?  Not on that one.  Aw, she loves tweeting out the stars.  She did compliment Louis CK on his Fat Girl episode of his series.  He must have loved that.  I don't know for sure, because he didn't reply.  I'm curious what he said.  He didn't say anything back.  Some of those idiots lashed out at Louis for that episode. 
[03:30:30]  I thought it was brilliantly written.  Why?  And again, I don't know what it's like to be a Fat Girl, but they had an issue with him.  Whatever.  Fuck yourself.  Wendy Williams.  She was on Wendy Williams.  That's pretty impressive.  She's been on it a few times.  Jenny gets around.  Jenny definitely has a little thing going on.  A little TV, a little radio.  She's sexy.  She's there.  If you squint, she's on the scene.  Now I'm going home.  Oh, man.
