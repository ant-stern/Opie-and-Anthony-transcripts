<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from WYSP in Philadelphia opened with technical difficulties, setting a chaotic tone for the entire show.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton returned to their old studio, remarking on its unchanged condition and reminiscing about past events, including a deceased monkey and former studio personnel.  They recounted their police escort to the station (largely unseen due to the early hour) and interactions with a small crowd outside, culminating in Jim Norton mooning the crowd at their request.  Tickets to their upcoming "ONA virus" comedy show at the Tweeter Center were offered as giveaways.

Numerous guests appeared throughout the show, both in studio and via phone.  Notable in-studio guests included Doug Stanhope and Jimmy Schubert.  Other guests mentioned or who called in included Kid Chris, Joey Vento, Tracy Morgan, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan, Bill Dwyer, and Dom Irrera.  The hosts discussed their previous night’s activities: Norton performing stand-up at the Helium Comedy Club, and Opie watching a movie interrupted by a technical glitch.  They also addressed listener backlash to their move to commercial radio and Opie's frustration with online comments.  Anthony commented extensively on Paris Hilton's recent DUI arrest.  A significant segment revisited a past radio bit involving medical professionals analyzing callers' unusual medical issues, which unexpectedly led to a possible cancer diagnosis in one instance.  MacBooks were also given away as prizes.

A substantial portion of the show focused on an on-air contest for tickets to the upcoming show. This involved increasingly outrageous listener challenges.  One listener, "Pat," with a severe ear infection, had it scraped out and fed to another listener, "Mark," an act assessed for health risks by a medical professional who called in.  Doug Stanhope recounted a controversial joke about Irish women that made headlines, discussing his refusal to end his set early.  The conversation expanded to the anxieties of aging comedians, drug use (including cocaine and anecdotes involving celebrities and athletes), and the challenges of maintaining a career beyond forty. Joey Vento, owner of Gino's Steaks, was interviewed about the controversy surrounding his "Speak English" sign, offering his perspective on immigration policy and defending his stance.  A humorous bit about a weatherman's cockroach encounters on live television was also included.  The show featured a recurring segment with Big A, a news contributor with a speech impediment, whose attempts at delivering news stories were a source of humor. An audience member offered to lick Big A’s armpits for tickets, and another, "Mike Hunt," engaged in humorous banter.  The hosts interacted with an Eagles fan outside the studio.

Further on-air stunts involved audience participation for show tickets. One involved a man licking a woman's chest, described as "horrendous" by the participant. Another involved a forced kiss between Tammy and Big A (Andrew Cuomo), heavily critiqued by the hosts as awkward and unsexy.  Technical difficulties with wireless microphones plagued an outdoor segment in Philadelphia, featuring interactions with the crowd and a man dressed as Ben Franklin, further discussion of Ben Franklin's life (and alleged syphilis), and continued attempts at audience participation stunts.

The show extensively discussed Tammy and her relationship with Big A, including sexually explicit details of her actions at a wedding reception and speculation about her infidelity.  Big A's feelings and perceived rejection were discussed humorously.  A phone call with Tracy Morgan provided anecdotes about his marriage and career.  Tammy and her husband called in, resulting in a heated argument, followed by more jokes about Tammy's weight and appearance, with some expressed regret from the hosts.  A phone interview with Don Marrera was mentioned, along with another call from Dom Irrera.  Mary Masterson from CNBC engaged in sexually suggestive banter. The show concluded with a blindfolded "blind date" segment, featuring a female guest ("Mary") touching and interacting with Big A, a cab driver from the Bronx, described in graphic detail, followed by a phone call from Imus, and concluding with banter between the hosts, Jim Norton, and Doug Stanhope, and a tense exchange between the hosts and Norton.  The show concluded with promotion of upcoming events and sponsorships from General Motors and Dish Network.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, it works.  It works.  Well, you never know when you go to another city.  I, um, I think I'm on the radio. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  I'm on the radio.  Ah.  Wait, try talking.  Creeps.  Oh, boy.  It's not on the radio.  Try that.  And their ability to turn.  Oh, boy.  It's still not on the radio.  I'll just go back to the room.  All right.  It's the Anthony and Jimmy show.  No, it's the Opie and Jimmy show. 
[00:02:00]  Anthony.  All right.  You know what I'm talking about.  Keep it simple.  Norton and Friends is having technical problems.  Wait.  It's going to be, uh, Jimmy alone.  Well, um, if Anthony doesn't get a mic in two seconds, he's going to go into a rage that  has never been, uh, seen before.  No, I understand these things.  Just don't talk, because no one can hear you.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, that's better.  Now we're all broadcasting.  Good morning, and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  I thought you were getting me back for Letterman.  No, I would have to keep your mic off all morning long.  Oh, ow.  Yeah, the virus is spreading, and today we say hi to Philly, broadcasting live from WYSP.  Right off the bat, Anthony and I walked in here about, uh, wow, an hour ago already.  Yeah, about an hour, yeah.  And we realized that this place hasn't changed in four and a half years.  When we last broadcast here, uh, we left never, ever thinking we were going to return after 
[00:03:00]  we got the boot, and here we are returning, and I just want to thank the staff for probably  what must have took months, um, getting it to look exactly like it did when we left.  Yeah, they weren't.  Because it couldn't possibly have the same ancient equipment in here, and carts, and things that  have not been used in years, they must have just done this like a set.  This is a facade. 
[00:03:30]  A false front, they call it.  If you go behind these, it's just paper, and it's held up by wooden sticks.  It can't be real.  They just want to make us feel at home.  Wow.  But last time we were here, there was a dead monkey in the studio.  That's true.  With a guy doing horrific things to the dead monkey.  Yep.  And remember the girls in the corner over there?  I certainly do.  They're long gone.  They're not there anymore.  No.  That's the only thing that's different.  We don't have the hot lesbian action in the back of the studio.  But everything else, exactly the same.  It's kind of creepy. 
[00:04:00]  It's very creepy, actually.  Well, we're broadcasting live from WYSP.  Of course, we've got the big comedy show tomorrow night at the Tweeter Center, and it's going  to be a lot of fun.  We've got a bunch of people outside already, too, Ant.  Yeah, I see them.  They're on a screen.  There they go, waving.  They're on a...  Oh, Jimmy, give them a show.  There you go.  Jimmy's first move to the crowd.  Oh, you're not high enough.  You're not high enough.  It's all guys, too, and they're all pissed off because your moon wasn't high enough.  Oh, good.  Yeah, leave picture in picture so we can see. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, we got picture in picture.  That's good.  Now we can monitor ourselves.  All right.  Jimmy is now...  No, you got to get higher up.  Higher, guys?  What the hell is that?  Yeah, they're saying even higher.  You want Kenny to hold you?  Wait.  Wait.  All right.  Hold on.  Yeah, you have to pick me up over your shoulder.  All right.  Kenny, Club Soda Kenny, will help Jim Norton out.  He's got to moon the crowd.  I guess we got to explain.  We got a camera in the studio.  They got a camera outside.  We got a monitor.  They got a monitor.  So this is for the crowd outside.  There's Jimmy's ass, and they're applauding. 
[00:05:00]  They like Jimmy's ass.  That is really creepy, though.  Club Soda Kenny lifting Jim Norton in the air so he can moon the crowd outside.  So it's a nice crowd so far.  So that's the camera view we have, right?  Of course, we got to see No Filter Paul in the front row.  Oh, there he is.  He's trying to get upstairs.  You're not coming upstairs today.  A little shrunken head.  A little limey.  All right.  But I want to thank everyone here at WISP for having us. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And then we went into our show prep room.  Yeah.  Where we were able to sit, and that should be roped off as a radio equipment museum.  Because, again, reel-to-reel tape recorders, which have not been used in the radio industry  in at least the last people to use it probably a decade ago.  And I want to see Opia cutting some tape like the old days. 
[00:06:00]  I could do it.  No problem.  Yeah.  No problem whatsoever.  Well, I guess we got to start with the police escort.  Ooh.  WISP does it up right.  Every time we come to Philly, they want to make sure we have a really, really good time.  And I walk downstairs, you know, to the lobby of the hotel.  Anthony's there, and Club Soda Kenny's there.  Is this my cushion?  Ooh.  Do you have a little cushion for your bottom?  I want to sit higher.  That's so we can get higher up.  Oh.  Well, now I'm an inch higher. 
[00:06:30]  Great.  You might want to bring a few more of these.  So we're in the lobby of the hotel.  There's limos waiting for us and stuff.  And Philly's finest.  Yeah.  The Philadelphia Police Department is outside to give us a police escort through the city  of Philadelphia.  That was pretty cool.  From the hotel to WYSP.  Must have been crazy.  Which, of course, is on Fifth and Market here in Philadelphia.  So the sirens are on. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, we're weaving in and out of air.  You know, it was the only way it was supposed to happen, though.  Yeah.  We get a police escort with these awesome limos, and there's no one to see us looking cool.  Not one.  Actually, there was one homeless guy that got to see us looking like rock stars.  I didn't see one car on the road that had to pull over to let us by.  No.  There was not one car on the road, because it's an ungodly hour.  Yeah, we're just waking everybody up in the neighborhood. 
[00:07:30]  I'm sure they're none too pleased.  Yeah, they were happy with these sirens wailing and us coming through.  And we pull up to WYSP, you know, with this huge display, the Philadelphia police and the  limos.  Club sort of Kenny gets out like Secret Service to hold back the crowd, because here comes  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  And Jim Norton for the first time to YSP in four years, and we're greeted by five people.  Well, that'll happen.  Five people. 
[00:08:00]  Kenny, I don't know.  All right.  Let me try this.  I think that mic works.  You got to give the cops props, though, because they were actually blocking the intersections  for the motorcade to come through.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Didn't you notice we never stopped at a light or anything?  Blocked the intersections for the motorcade to proceed.  So there were more police on the route?  Yeah.  It was like a presidential motorcade.  You got to give props to the cops.  But no one saw it.  Do we get to do it after the show?  That might be more impressive. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're with us all day.  Oh, okay.  That's very cool.  So we thought that was very impressive, and we thank WYSP for that.  But no one got to see us looking like rock stars.  It's always the way.  We set it up like that, and we just look like a couple of idiots like we are.  It's early.  It is very early.  I got up five-something, and, you know.  Oh, five-something.  Yeah.  I'm at a bed at 525.  I left at 530. 
[00:09:00]  Did you have any fun in your room last night?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, okay.  You counted.  Yeah.  You don't want to share?  I'm nervous, he gets.  Nothing to share.  I was trying to think, how do I phrase this?  Lubricant.  Your monitor.  I got you.  And God watching.  And all your dead relatives looking down in shame.  Oh, boy.  That's you.  Especially if they saw the site I was on.  He likes that. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, no.  Not that site.  Who touched him as a kid?  Who touched him?  Do you think dead relatives that died before computers came out can understand what's on  your screen and what it's all about?  I hope not.  Well, you know, it's like, what is that contraption he's looking at?  Well, we talked about it.  They always tell you that your dead relatives are looking at you and they're still here.  Oh, great.  And you think, well, that's not too good.  That's all nice when you're doing something noble.  Right.  But when you're doing something horrific like Jimmy was doing. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  If you're feeding starving children in Africa, I want daddy looking at me.  Yeah.  When you're accepting an Academy Award, you always hear, you know, I know mom's looking down  right now and she's so proud.  Right.  It's like, but when you're in that position where your leg is up and her head is buried  in the pillow and, you know, the mirror is showing the backside of the whole action and  it's just disgusting.  Temples and all.  Yeah.  And there's a sheep in the room.  It's not like, I just want to know dad's looking down. 
[00:10:30]  How embarrassing is that?  There's a girl behind you strapping on a belt with a contraption on the end.  It looks like a long black nose.  Thank God.  Give us the on off switch for this amazing thing.  It looks like the black remake of Pinocchio.  Wow.  Don't need that.  No.  Except because he's black.  He always lies.  It never goes down.  By the way, we're attempting to take over Philly this weekend.  You know, we got the ONA traveling virus at the Tweeter Center tomorrow night and, you 
[00:11:00]  know, across the river in Camden.  Yep.  Matter of fact, for the people outside that don't have tickets, we're going to try to give  a lot of people tickets to the show tomorrow.  Last night, we went to the Helium Comedy Club and saw Bill Dwyer.  You did?  Yeah.  I just wanted to work on material.  Yeah.  So I stopped in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was cool.  You did a little set there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill's a buddy of mine.  So I wanted to see him.  And it was good.  It was a small crowd.  Something happened.  They were supposed to have more people and a bunch didn't show up.  So it was some kind of a weird event.  Something happened.  What?  I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  Anthrax?  No.  They don't know either.  But they said it was like a weird block of group that didn't show up, which is odd.  Well, football started last night, so he was competing with the Steelers and the Dolphins.  Congratulations to Pittsburgh.  Oh, good.  Pittsburgh beat the Dolphins last night.  Sorry, Big Ken.  Sorry about that.  But Pittsburgh over the Dolphins last night.  I'm trying to feel like I know what happened.  That was a heck of a ball game.  Yeah, huh?  Right.  Did you see that hit?  Yeah, the guy. 
[00:12:00]  But the other guy hit him?  Oh, I think about it with his wife.  But you got lippy at halftime.  But we were at Helium Comedy Club here in Philly last night.  We talk about Helium a lot because a lot of our guys come down here and do sets and stuff.  The first time I saw the club, it's really, really nice.  They run a nice club down here.  Yes.  And the area's a little weird.  They might want a bigger sign outside so you could find the damn place.  How about a sign?  It's a computer printout on the door.  Right.  It's a great club.  It looks brand new inside. 
[00:12:30]  And they need a better sign.  There's like a dumb tree hiding it.  Yeah, from outside, it looks like a bodega or something.  You're like, oh, this is where the comedy club is.  And then you walk in and it's beautiful inside.  So then Jimmy went on stage before Bill Dwyer just destroyed.  Yeah.  We're in the back row just laughing.  Your new material, Jimmy, is really funny.  Oh, thank you.  I was telling Anthony when we got to WISP.  Yes, I got to see it.  Thanks.  Really funny stuff.  Your stuff on dating is right on mark.  Right on mark.  Can you just come to my room and perform it? 
[00:13:00]  I certainly will.  Because I don't go out.  I'll act it out wordlessly on you.  Ask your chick to leave and I'll be the girl and I'll show you every punchline twice.  Thank you.  Let's set that up.  So, yeah, Helium was nice to us and we missed you, Anthony.  Where were you last night?  I was in my hotel room, which is wonderful.  Thank you.  The WISP, the fine people of WISP set us up with little gift things.  Did you notice that? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Opened up a little thing.  There was one for the ladies and one for the guys.  And you open it up and then we realized, like, all right, this is cool.  There's some, like, creams in there.  There was some kind of body butter cream that we opened up and there was a finger mark right in the middle.  Like, someone couldn't resist just sticking their finger in it.  I guess that went to the garbage can.  Yeah, that one ain't going to be used.  And then we noticed that maybe they filled some of the gift box up with various magazines that might have been just sitting in the hotel room. 
[00:14:00]  I think I saw the room service book in there.  That gift basket's stuck.  If Tonda didn't deliver it to me, I would have thrown it out the window.  But I just kept staring at her and I didn't realize it was awful until she was gone for a half hour.  It looked impressive, though.  Oh, yeah.  It did.  Until you started, like, rifling through it and realized, yeah, there's a bunch of Opie and Anthony, like, bumper stickers in there.  Yeah, I got a couple of those. 
[00:14:30]  I think I got that already.  There's a little card advertisement for the virus show.  So, yeah.  It's like, I think I don't need a reminder as to when and where this will take place.  The Philadelphia magazine.  Yeah.  You know.  The map might come in handy.  The map.  And then, what, the Eagles cheerleaders calendar or something was pretty cool.  That was pretty good.  Eagles cheerleaders calendar.  I didn't mind that.  Semi-clad women.  Hey, is Club Soda Kenny around?  I got to ask him something.  Of course he is.  And I want him to be honest. 
[00:15:00]  And he's probably running now to get in here.  Okay.  What's up, Keith?  He's downstairs meeting somebody.  Oh, there he is.  He's on the camera.  I'm on the camera.  And he's not even on it.  Look.  You see his dopey hand waving.  Is that him waving that?  Yeah.  He's not in frame.  Kenny, move over.  Move over, you adult.  YSP did it up right, man.  Can you leave that picture on picture on?  Yeah, we should do that.  So, we got cameras.  We could see the listeners outside WISP.  They could see us.  Of course, we're at Fifth and Market.  There's Club Soda Kenny on camera right now. 
[00:15:30]  This looks like footage.  The quality of the footage.  It looks like every child kidnapping, every caught on a security camera.  All right, Kenny's coming upstairs.  Only the guy on there now is creepier.  I got to ask him.  Kenny, come on upstairs.  I got to ask you something real fast.  Okay.  In the meantime.  Is there somebody dressed as a baby?  Yes.  We asked for an adult baby, remember?  He's got a bonnet on.  We want a real adult baby, though. 
[00:16:00]  That's someone that throws his arms up and goes,  Oh, it ain't party rock!  He's drunk already.  We want the real deal.  I think we should hand out money if everyone in that little tent rapes him right now.  They're all pounding on him, ripping his clothes.  Someone just grabbed the back of his head.  Hey, the crowd is growing, too.  This is pretty cool.  We got lots to give away, by the way.  We have ten pair of pit tickets to the traveling virus.  That's very cool.  We also have a pair of tickets to sit on the stage on the couches that we're giving away today. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, nice.  Those are popular seats.  We're going to do this all outside.  By the way, we're going to be outside WISP right at 9.30.  And we also have a pair of Eagles tickets.  They're playing the Giants.  Very cool.  So we got lots of stuff to give away as we're broadcasting live from Philly.  Isn't it weird to be back in here, man?  Like I'm looking at you over this console.  It's just a bizarre vehicle.  It's like we never left.  Oh, dude.  It's really weird.  Never, ever expected to be back here.  No.  That's what it was.  There was not a chance in hell of coming back here. 
[00:17:00]  I was here without you guys a couple times, just like doing gigs coming through.  I could never mention Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it was awful.  It was weird, huh?  Yeah.  It was horrible.  I was back here in May.  I sat right outside that studio for an hour waiting to be invited in to do a little radio.  Oh, you weren't going to be invited in.  Oh, that made me feel really good.  Oh, you weren't allowed.  Cousin Ed was doing his show, and I'm just sitting outside there.  I came in and said hi, and then he went back to do his show, and then I just sat out there  going, hello, invite me in.  Yeah.  Let's do a little something here. 
[00:17:30]  He thought I was just hanging outside because it was raining hard, I guess.  They wouldn't let you.  It was against the rules.  No, that was two months ago.  Oh, I thought you were talking about during the two years.  No.  I come down to Philly a lot, and I decided on one of my visits to Philly, I'd stop by WISP,  see the old joint now that we're allowed back in, and I sat outside that studio door  for hours.  Not hours.  That's about an hour, though.  About an hour.  Well, that wasn't very nice.  Club Soda Kenny in studio.  Kenny, you've got to be honest with me. 
[00:18:00]  Yes, sir.  So we get into town yesterday, and on the way down, we were listening to Matt and Huggy  on WISP, and who was it, Matt?  One of the guys said he can't go to the O&A traveling virus tomorrow at the Tweeter Center  because he's going camping.  Hmm.  So I called Jimmy because I knew you were still sleeping in New York, and I knew Jimmy was  about a mile behind me in Kenny's car, so I said, Jimmy, let's call these guys and bust  on them.  So we did a phone with them, and it was fun, but we couldn't hear each other, whatever. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  So then we're in the hotel yesterday afternoon, and we called Kid Chris, Ant and I did.  But to try to make a phone call out of the hotel, I couldn't do it.  I just used my cell.  Well, I didn't want to do that.  No?  I don't like people knowing my cell number.  I'm going to ask.  I know.  I wasn't thinking.  Who was going to know your number that you didn't want to know it?  Just a little paranoid, I guess.  I don't know.  Okay.  So I'm trying to call out from my room, and I just can't do it. 
[00:19:00]  I was getting so frustrated.  Kenny calls at that moment.  I go, Kenny, I can't call out.  And I knew you were already probably on the air.  Yeah, I wasn't.  No, I'm on hold.  And I was the one who said, come on, Ant, we got to call Kid Chris and do a little time.  They were talking to that crackhead broad.  Lizzie.  Oh, my God.  What a mess she sounded like.  That was fun.  Yeah.  So Kenny goes, I'll be right up.  And he runs up to my room, right?  And stupid me not even thinking.  My girlfriend is showering.  Oh.  And you got the same type of room where there's like two doors to the bathroom?  Two doors. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  So it almost looks like it's not even a bathroom, not a room, because the doors are huge and  stuff.  And you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  So Kenny comes knocking on the door.  I'm not even thinking.  And I just let him in.  I go, help me figure this out.  So the question I have for Kenny, did you see her naked?  I was too fixated on your tighty whities.  Oh, yeah.  I was walking around in my tighty whities.  Boy, did you look at the wrong thing.  No, I didn't. 
[00:20:00]  So you did not see her naked?  No, sir.  I have too much respect for you and your lady.  Well, she was in the shower, because after you left, you know, she's like, hello.  And I wasn't even thinking.  I averted my eyes.  Yeah.  I had blinders on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I was on a mission.  You had to make the phone call.  For some reason, now you can't dial a phone.  So I had to help you out.  Oh, that sounded like an insult.  I called the front desk.  They said, dial nine.  And I did that. 
[00:20:30]  Then they said, dial eight.  Then one.  And then the area code.  I did that.  Then someone else.  Because I called them three times.  They gave me three different ways to call out to my room.  At one point, they said, dial nine, eight, one.  And then the area code.  Yeah.  He was calling like other countries.  Hello.  Hello.  Whatever.  But we had a really good time with Kid Chris yesterday.  And we thank him and everybody here for their support.  What happened with the movie last night?  I was annoyed.  I just like, when we come into town, some people like going out.  Like, you guys get together. 
[00:21:00]  You go out and do things.  I am the room service movie guy.  Hang out.  Lay on the nice comfy bed.  Watch a movie.  I hadn't seen the Superman Returns yet.  Right.  And, of course, it's in the still in theater section of your menu.  Very nice.  So I buy that movie.  Get about halfway through.  You know, nature calls.  So we pause the movie.  Come back.  Go to unpause it. 
[00:21:30]  And you got to go through this whole rigmarole there.  Pressing buttons.  And it says, return to the movie.  Hit the return to the movie.  Waiting.  Waiting.  And just going like, oh, no.  Uh-oh.  And then, the Warner Brothers logo comes back on.  In the middle of the movie they had that?  I know.  The credits start rolling again.  The beginning of the movie.  And we're about an hour and 20 minutes in.  So it's not like you could just sit through five minutes.  That would be fine.  But, and there's no forward. 
[00:22:00]  There's no fast forward on it.  So you sit there.  And, again, in disgust, I'm throwing things like a chimp around the room and just got completely disgusted and gave up.  So now, thank God I know how the movie ends.  I was going to say, you know how Superman ends.  Yeah.  In a wheelchair.  That isn't Superman.  That's the Christopher Reeve story.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But I think Superman ends, you know.  What's the 3D stuff on regular TV? 
[00:22:30]  Well, my room was in 3D.  But the movie itself, still just two dimensions.  No, because when you went to the theaters, they made you throw on the 3D glasses.  Theater, what's that?  I haven't been to one in quite some time.  I forgot, you freak.  I don't go to the movie theater.  Like when the whole plane scene was kind of in 3D.  Yeah, I saw that.  So how did that look on a regular TV?  Like an action plane crashing scene.  But it looked real?  Yeah, it looked pretty good. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  But not 3D.  Like, I don't know what they do.  You had to wear the glasses.  Yeah, you had.  They got stuff floating in front of you, and you see the whole theater reaching out, trying  to grab the cell phone.  Oh, see, that wasn't in there.  That wasn't in there.  No.  No, they took all that 3D stuff out.  All right.  All right.  We just hung out in the room.  Didn't do much of anything.  I know you guys went to the comedy club and stuff, but I'm worthy.  Hang out.  All right.  By the way, once again today, and there's the plug, we're going late again today on regular 
[00:23:30]  radio.  Of course we are.  Which means we have to go late on XM later on this morning.  Yes.  To keep everybody happy.  Oh, perish the thought.  Because now they're bitching because we did an extra half hour on regular radio yesterday.  This is really tough to keep everybody happy.  I spent a little bit of time on the message board yesterday, and oh my God, some of these  people just want to reach out and choke them.  They weren't happy?  Not happy.  It was one of those, since ONA are doing FM radio, everything sucks now. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  What happened?  Everything.  And, you know, I just finally wrote, all right, whatever.  You don't like, screw you.  I gave up.  I actually, you know, I used to rant, and the F word was used a lot, and I'd insult people's  mothers and things like that.  And I just, this time, I just calmly typed, all right, what am I going to do?  Can't please everybody.  I go, but it's not about you, douchebag.  It's, you know, we're on a mission before, and they always bring up, I was a listener 
[00:24:30]  since day one.  No, you weren't.  You know who the listeners were since day one?  Me and Opie.  And the whole plan was to get a huge audience and be huge in radio.  That's what we said at the old IHOP.  And whatever it takes to do that might piss you off sometimes.  We're on commercial radio.  You know why they call it commercial radio?  Because that's commercials.  And we now love commercials. 
[00:25:00]  Commercials are the best part of the show.  They are.  They help build family.  All right, listen.  Why wouldn't I lay, let me just randomly bring out a sponsor.  General Motors.  Opie, just off the top of my head, let me say, General Motors.  Do you know what they're doing?  No.  They got 100,000 miles of coverage and a whole new level of confidence now standard on  2007 cars and trucks.  You can learn more about it yourself just by going to GM.com. 
[00:25:30]  Now, that might sound like, you know, a commercial, but I was just rattling that off.  And we want to thank them for making us work longer.  Working longer.  Yeah.  Because we don't get anything out of it.  They get so annoyed on that message board because, you know, I have 8,000 posts and I was here from the beginning.  And our goal is to build a huge audience.  And I'm sorry, that does entail getting new listeners.  They say we could be like a jackass over there on Sirius and entertain the same 100,000 people that he got in 1980 and 1990. 
[00:26:00]  That isn't what we're doing.  We're bringing new people on board the show.  And by doing that, sometimes the people that have been there a while are going to get really pissed.  Well, ask the fans.  Do they like that?  Oh, go screw.  Oh, they're not.  Well, maybe I shouldn't ask that question.  Of course they don't.  I think those are the guys that you were arguing with.  Those are the hardcore people. 
[00:26:30]  Wow, not the reaction I was looking for.  But they get virus shows and tickets, free tickets because of it.  You think if we were just sitting there talking to a couple of hundred thousand people, we'd be able to put on a huge comedy virus tour?  No.  Do you absolutely think we'd be able to do that in multiple cities around this country?  It wouldn't work.  It's part of the sacrifice.  It's what they call a give and take.  All right.  We're going late because...  We take entertainment from you and people give us money.  That's right.  We're going late because of GM today. 
[00:27:00]  So we'll be on until 930 on commercial radio.  Deal with it.  And if you're hearing this in a replay or later on the day, then you just figure it out.  We're going an extra half hour thanks to GM.  And I'm trying to get Pal Talk to work.  All right.  Yeah, we'll get Pal Talk up in the studio.  We're just getting started.  It could be a very long day on the radio.  We're psyched to be here live in Philadelphia on WYSP.  Here's the deal.  Doug Stanhope.  We ran into him.  He's coming by any moment now.  Uh-oh.  He's coming by. 
[00:27:30]  He's probably still drunk or on some kind of drug.  Some kind of narcotic.  We should play Guess the Drug.  Doug Stanhope is on.  Also, Jimmy Schubert's stopping by.  Joey Vento.  We met Joey Vento a couple months ago from Geno Stakes.  He is hilarious.  We love what he's doing.  Yeah.  And he's got all sorts of things he wants to talk about this morning.  So if you haven't heard Joey Vento yet, stick around.  Trust me on that one.  Tracy Morgan calling in today.  We got one of the guys from the Wu-Tang Clan calling in today. 
[00:28:00]  We got Bill Dwyer that we saw at Helium.  He's there all weekend long here in Philadelphia.  He's stopping by.  And Don Marrera will be calling the show as well.  So a very, very busy show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Today we say hi to Philadelphia.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  We're angry. 
[00:28:30]  I'm scared.  Good morning.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony show, the ONA virus.  Philly edition.  It has spread to Philadelphia.  That's right.  Broadcast live from WISP.  We have a nice crowd outside the studio.  They're applauding.  We could see them.  They could see us.  We got this huge flat screen TV in the studio. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, you can even move the camera around.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  I got a little remote control.  Hey, there's more people out there than I thought.  Nice.  And I'm moving around.  And they're showing up.  Yeah.  See?  Okay.  I hear there's like, I don't know, about 60 people outside so far.  We're going to be outside at 930 doing some stuff as we go from one show to the other.  And we're going to be giving away a lot of things, including tickets to see the Eagles  and a lot of tickets to see the ONA traveling virus at the Tweeter Center tomorrow night 
[00:29:30]  in Camden, New Jersey.  Oh, look at that, Jimmy.  Just for you.  Jimmy mooned the crowd earlier, and now they're starting to moon us back.  Nice tam line.  Good to know.  We still don't have any female listeners, by the way.  What do we got?  Two ladies in the crowd so far?  I see one.  And then I see one that might be a lady.  I'm not really sure yet.  And the camera.  Where is that one?  Where is she?  We got one lady, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there's another one, I think.  There's two right there.  Oh, another girl.  All right.  We got three girls. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, you're a lady, too?  Okay.  What's that thing right there?  That's the one I'm not sure about.  All right.  Right there?  Yeah, I can't.  Are you a woman or a?  I think she might be a woman.  You're a woman?  No.  Stop.  Yeah, I know.  This is very visual for everybody.  But we love the technology they got us here at WISP.  Paris Hilton on the front page of all the newspapers.  We said this would be great for her career, getting pulled over for DUI. 
[00:30:30]  It's not like she's running for political office or anything.  No, she's a whore.  She's a whore.  And if you get a DUI as a whore, that's a badge of honor.  Yeah.  That's good.  Absolutely.  And she's got the new CD out that stinks.  But you know what?  Just because she's on the front page of all the newspapers, she's going to sell more CDs today.  That's just how it works.  I don't know why.  Why would that make you buy her CD?  Hey, she's a drunk.  I got to get to the record store.  Yeah.  Why?  You were going to buy the Audioslave CD, but now that you see her on the front page of 
[00:31:00]  the newspapers and you find out she's a drunk, now you're like, yeah, now I got to check  out her CD.  You're right.  You need the Paris Hilton.  We're stupid in America.  The only way I would buy the Paris Hilton CD is if I was going to kill myself.  I'd load it into my CD player and just drive over people on the sidewalk as it was playing.  Yeah.  So then in the news story, there was this horrific thing they could say.  And for some reason, the Paris Hilton CD was playing in his CD player.  Well, the front page, Paris is squirming. 
[00:31:30]  Paris in cuffs, photo exclusive.  This is the moment of humiliation for party girl Paris Hilton.  That's the moment of humiliation?  No.  I think that night shot was the moment of humiliation.  Yeah.  This one was shot with lights, not the night shot camera.  Yeah.  I think the video of her going bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, was a little more humiliating.  But they're calling it this is the moment of humiliation for Paris.  For her parents.  For party girl Paris Hilton after being busted and handcuffed by L.A. cops for DUI. 
[00:32:00]  She was later released.  She's smiling.  She's not humiliated.  Of course.  And she looks really, really drunk, by the way, in these pictures.  They're trying to claim that she had one drink on an empty stomach.  And that's what put her over the top.  Yeah.  Blew a 0.8 or 0.08, right?  Yeah.  Always get that confused.  0.08, 0.08.  A 0.8.  You've been dead for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She blew a 0.8.  0.1.  0.8.  They're tapping your body and having a party.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  You become a keg.  You become the keg.  Speaking of which, I see Doug Stanhope outside the studio.  Oh, no.  This would be a great intro for Mr. Stanhope.  Let's bring Doug in.  We got lots of people stopping by the show today.  Ladies and gentlemen, Doug Stanhope.  That's good.  You don't look too bad, actually.  I feel that bad.  You feel bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you go to bed?  Yeah, I went to bed.  We were trying to figure out where you were performing last night.  We wanted to check you out.  Or is it tonight?  No, it was last night.  No one knew.  Not in this town tonight. 
[00:33:00]  No one knew.  No, you wouldn't want to.  It was a rock and roll bar, but it was packed beyond where a comedy audience could even enjoy  it.  I screwed a quarter of the crowd who showed up because they were in the bar.  They couldn't even see.  Oh, I can hear them over the speaker if everyone shuts up.  It was one of those gigs?  Yeah.  You guys get to do those fun gigs from time to time, huh?  Can everyone keep it down so we can hear the comic in the other room where we can't see them?  That works well. 
[00:33:30]  I tell the story from time to time.  Huge Doris fan.  Back in the day on Long Island, when I was working for WBAB, I did a lot of the rock shows.  And Robbie Krieger was playing this small play.  What was it called?  The Brokerage or something like that?  It was a really tiny rock club?  It was some crap hole.  I don't know.  I played it too.  Not that it matters, but I show up.  I have to be the DJ that introduces Rob Krieger and throw out a couple of dumb radio station  t-shirts.  So Rob Krieger comes out. 
[00:34:00]  I'm like, oh, wow, this is kind of cool, even though it's many, many years past his prime.  But there he is playing his heart out.  And it's not even a rock club.  It's one of these bars that has pool tables.  And they had the Islander game on.  And they had the volume up on the Islander game as Rob Krieger, Robbie Krieger, trying  to play in the corner.  And then the Islanders are scoring.  And everyone's cheering for the Islanders.  I felt so bad for this guy.  I mean, this guy has seen it all.  And it ends like this, him in this dumb dump as people are playing pool and screaming for  the Islanders on the TV. 
[00:34:30]  The same thing happened to me.  I played that same bar.  And the game was on.  And right when we finished a song, the Islanders scored.  And I go, yeah, yeah.  And I'm thinking for a split second, hey, wow, we really hit that one, man.  We knocked that one out of the park.  They're loving that tune.  And then you realize, oh.  I started in Vegas where you'd have people playing the slot machines right at the bar.  It was, say, you're the bar trainer.  And then there's the bar with slot machines or poker machines on the bar. 
[00:35:00]  And then the crowd.  So you'd have people hitting Royal Flushes right in front of you.  You thought you just had a brilliant joke.  And now they just got a Royal Flushes.  On the set up, they're screaming.  You're like, oh, this is going to be a gem.  Pain in the ass.  What was the name of the club, dude?  Voss left me some incoherent message about it.  The Kyber Bar.  It was a cool place.  It was just way too small for what we did.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  Well, Todd Barry plays there.  He set me up with it.  Did he?  Yeah.  He'll be a screensaver.  So the last time we talked to you, Doug just laughs.  Yeah.  And like a whole evening of phlegm comes up.  Tubercular cough.  Val Kilburn.  Are you sick?  Yeah, hey, Lunger.  Yeah.  Are you sick or something?  Yeah, I brought the AIDS back from Scotland.  I smoke so much.  Anytime I get the flu, the cough hangs on for another six weeks. 
[00:36:00]  Doug walks by Asian people, cover their mouths with tissues.  You were in Scotland?  Yeah, I did a month over there.  I swore I'd never do any more than a week.  And I did the full run of the Fringe Festival.  Yeah.  I've never been so depressed.  I was looking forward to the East Coast after that.  Have you ever gone over there?  No.  I get invited to do something.  I just thought, I hate you.  Why the depression?  It's just bleak and dismal.  It's always raining. 
[00:36:30]  Castle, yeah.  That old stone.  There's no colors over there.  It's not even that it's always raining.  I hear it's just always just like wet in the air, just misty all the time.  Yeah, and it's really cold.  Yeah, it's damp.  Do you see the sun?  Does it ever come out?  Yeah, but it's like Alaska.  It's always at a weird angle.  Occasionally, the sun.  Sorry, I'd like to die right here on your show.  He's just going to die. 
[00:37:00]  Do we have a medic nearby?  Do you need something to drink?  Yes.  I don't know.  You creep me out.  I want you to go get me something to drink so you're not looming over me.  Isn't he a ghoul?  He is.  Club soda Kenny.  He's a nice guy.  Oh, but he's a dolt.  I feel like I'm getting whacked.  He looks like an extra from The Sopranos, doesn't he?  He looks like one of Tony's boys in the background that never talks.  Here's some water.  Now I'm going to smash your fingers. 
[00:37:30]  He's a horrible guy.  Do you like the comedy in Scotland, though?  Yeah, they're great crowds because miserable people usually are.  I was complaining about it to the point where someone heckled me with that.  Why do you come here?  I go, because I'm a comic.  That's where we do well.  That's where our business thrives is where people are the most miserable.  You don't have comedy clubs in Costa Rica because everyone's happy.  That's a good point.  Rum drink on the beach.  They don't need you to point out problems.  Shut up, funny man.  I'm drinking and looking at some ass.  You know what else sucks? 
[00:38:00]  Stop with what sucks.  I'm on the beach with a rum drink.  I'm on the beach with a 14-year-old whore.  Will you stop with what sucks?  You know what I hate?  Nothing.  This is paradise, idiot.  Shut up.  Hey, Waikiki, about that Ramsey killing?  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  I don't mean to laugh at your lungs, but wow.  Yeah.  Do you smoke or is it that you smoke a lot?  I thought maybe it was just a club.  I quit five years ago.  Quit five years? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Voss, I talked to him and it was like 11 weeks.  That's a guy we never thought.  My mother's like, after 46 years, just quit.  She's six weeks quit.  She's doing the, she's got the emphysema.  That's what, if you get that, that helps you quit.  Yeah.  That'll help.  Yeah.  Suction your lungs out while you're awake.  Well, it might be time for you to quit then, because I'm hearing emphysema myself right  in the studio here.  It doesn't sound real good.  It's not as bad as I thought it would be when I quit, man.  I patched for like the 10-week program. 
[00:39:00]  It wasn't as bad as I thought, man.  And Doug Stanhope's in his prom.  I can't get that out of my head now.  Come on, Lunger.  Jimmy had a...  I'll be your huckleberry.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Jimmy got scared straight as far as the smoking thing goes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We did a bit on our show.  We got to bring it back.  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  What the hell is that is the bit.  And we have people just come in with things they don't know what's going on with their  bodies.  And we had doctors. 
[00:39:30]  And we thought it would be a fun, goofy bit.  Like one guy, when he eats spicy food, only half his face sweats profusely.  So we had him eat some hot wings and half his face.  And it turned out it was cancer.  Yeah.  And Jim never smoked.  Well, that was the...  It's not the tumor.  That was the problem, because to us it was just a funny thing.  But they're saying, oh, that's a sign of a serious neurological disorder.  And we're like, oh, man, this bit was supposed to be fun for everybody.  And then another guy, he's sort of going blind, but he thinks it might have been a temporary 
[00:40:00]  thing.  And the doctor had to tell him that his cornea is being eaten away slowly but surely.  Some degenerative cornea disease.  So by the end...  Oh, the show was a load of laughs.  By the end, it was hilarious.  And you thought you were just tired.  You're going blind.  By the end, we were so depressed, you know.  And these people called ahead of time.  So we knew their stuff was more goofy than serious.  But all of a sudden, a guy decides to walk off the street.  And he had what?  Some...  A white bump in his mouth.  A white bump in his gum line.  Yeah.  Yeah, in his mouth. 
[00:40:30]  So he comes in.  I'm like, I was listening to your show.  I'm a big fan.  I want to come by and see what the hell this is, right?  So one of the doctors slips on a little white glove and starts feeling around in his mouth  and touching.  And then he turned to us and made this uh-oh face.  Oh, my God.  And then one doctor tapped out.  He goes, I don't want to be a part of this bit anymore.  Another guy's giving us the big C sign that you do at sporting events.  He was doing like the YMCA.  Right.  He like did the big C.  Like, oh, what does that mean? 
[00:41:00]  Canker sore?  No, it's a bigger C than that.  Yeah, we're hoping that, yeah, it was any C word besides cancer.  He's looking around praying to see a woman.  Was that the closer?  That was the closer.  That was the closer.  That was all right.  So, Jimmy, take it from there.  You don't bring up the hangnail act after that one.  Well, you know, that's...  I can tell you this much.  The guy's mouth is wide open.  The doctors are taking a look.  The ones that were still in on the bit.  And all of a sudden, the guy, who was a tough, like, you know, construction worker type, all 
[00:41:30]  of a sudden is like, oh, God, just tell me what it is.  His voice is cracking.  Now, you watch a show like ER or any of those shows, they portray that moment when a doctor  tells someone horrible news.  And you watch and you're like, oh, my God, that must be awful.  Well, to see that live is horrific.  Well, he goes, the guy, they weren't, they wouldn't say, we think you should get tested  further.  Yeah, just have this checked.  The panic that hit this guy, it was like, he's like, he's trying to hold on to a sound  and he's like, okay, oh, what do I do?  Where should I go? 
[00:42:00]  Should I have this checked out?  And watching him try to stay, he had 10 questions calm.  Yeah, but he, exactly, like, that's what it's like.  Well, his mind is just like, the gears are spinning in his head.  Question after question without an answer coming, because he was just, like, freaking  out.  Who can I see right now?  Where can I go?  And his voice is cracking.  We're like, oh, crap, man.  He's just picturing himself, you know he's picturing himself without a lower jaw.  Did you ever hear from him again?  Uh-huh.  If he was a big fan and he found out he had cancer on your show, you'd think he'd be  listening to him all the time. 
[00:42:30]  And every time you brought up this story, hey, I'm still alive, guys.  Yeah, we would love to, you know, keep it right there.  But the update, it turned out, even though all the people in the studio said it was cancer,  it turned out it wasn't cancer, it turned out it checked out.  But he had to find out, like, a month later, because, you know, you have to wait and all  that, and then he finally called us with the update and said, you know, it wasn't cancer  after all.  I guess.  Right?  To me, yeah, but watching his face, when he thought he, I'm like, that's exactly what  it looks like when you find out you have, like, jaw cancer or mouth cancer.  And I'm like, I'm going to have one more cigarette and I'm finished.  I'm going to finish my pack and I'm done. 
[00:43:00]  I can't do it anymore.  Wow.  And Anthony screamed at me, just throw him out.  So I said, all right, I'll have one more.  So I have one more faggoty parlor in the hallway.  I went to the cellar and Esty from the cellar put the patch on me and I hadn't smoked since.  Wow.  But man, I thought it was going to be harder than it was.  I mean, I jonesed for a while, but then it got better.  Yeah.  So there you go.  That's what everyone says.  It's like falling asleep next to the bean pod.  You know, at the beginning, you don't want to, you don't want to.  And then once you do it.  I've quit for nine months.  Really?  Yeah.  And then when something happens and you're like.  No, it's actually, last time I started again, nothing, like everything over that nine months 
[00:43:30]  happened, my dad died as I got for a TV show or something years ago, like everything that  I could have used as an excuse, I didn't.  Yeah.  One day I was like, I was one of those, you know, you're going to die anyway conversations  to have some guy that was wicked in this ketamine.  I went to another planet and I talked to alternate life form and they said, you know, life's just  a joke and I'm like, I should have a cigarette. 
[00:44:00]  There's some really bad, no, non-reason.  That's awesome.  Are we promoting anything today, Doug?  No.  Because you're out of town?  No, I'll be in Worcester and Boston.  I'm in New York tonight, but.  What are you doing in New York, man?  No, in Sal's comedy hole for two shows and Pianos for one show with Todd Berry.  What's Pianos?  Some bar like this, like the Khyber.  Okay.  All right, cool.  You want to promote the Worcester show?  We're being heard in Boston.  Yeah, Ralph.  Yeah, Ralph's, my hometown. 
[00:44:30]  It was Worcester.  Ralph's Chadwick Square Diner.  And then on Sunday night, the Abbey Lounge.  Very cool.  All right.  Doug's from Boston?  No, Worcester.  I don't know yet.  Okay.  All right.  Listen, yeah, we're looking to have people send us their 30-second or less production piece  about the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yep.  And the week of October 2nd, we're going to announce the best five entries.  We did this a couple months ago.  It sucked because we didn't have enough time.  We have plenty of time to get some good entries now.  Basically, looking for 30-second production pieces about this fine radio show.  Yep.  And the top five entries will win new MacBooks. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  New MacBooks.  You got to.  Can I enter?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Those MacBooks are pretty cool.  Submit your entry at 923freefm.com, 923freefm.com by September 29th.  And we're going to pick the five best, and you'll get MacBooks.  Wait, do you know, maybe you know the question of this, because I never had Mac.  I always had PC, and they gave me a Mac, so I'm like, I want to dump my PC now.  If you pick up a bunch of laptops, can you hook those screens up, too, or can you all use 
[00:45:30]  those desktops?  What the hell are you talking about?  Like, with Mac.  It's too early.  With Mac, you can have three desktops open.  Yeah.  On one, and like one mouse running the whole thing.  Can you do that on laptops, too, or is it all with desktops, and you can network like  that?  No, I think you could do it with laptops, too.  All right.  Yeah.  Sure.  My PC.  To check out the new MacBook, go to apple.com.  All right?  So, we're going to take a break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Doug, they could see you, by the way.  We got, they're waving at you right now, and Doug's waving back. 
[00:46:00]  Good morning.  A little bit.  We got a nice crowd out there so far.  We got this huge flat-screen TV in the studio.  I'll be outside smoking in a minute.  Leave me alone.  Well, we can listen to you smoke.  We got a, I think we got a microphone for us.  I don't know.  Let me see if this works.  Uh, uh, uh.  Ah!  Wow.  Can we hear you guys?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Do you guys want omelets?  They got omelets up here.  All right.  I'll bring several tens of dozens down. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Leave Doug alone when he goes outside to smoke.  All right, guys.  Go with him and stand close to him while he smokes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sure he's okay.  All right.  We got to step aside.  Uh, we got lots to do today.  We got, is Gino here yet?  I think he's eight o'clock.  Is Gino at eight o'clock?  All right.  Don't worry.  We'll figure it out during the break.  I was just babbling.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  We're in Philadelphia at WYSP.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference he can get to something cool, hip, and groovy. 
[00:47:00]  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when your wife changes the line?  See, I'll be there for the show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetie.  If you walk past them, don't take your jewelry and take your purse.  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Freaky.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  Is this the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
[00:47:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oops.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie virus spreading across America.  Broadcasting live from the WISP studios.  We've got a nice crowd outside.  Let's hear the crowd.  Let's hear the crowd.  Let me pan the crowd a little there.  That is an amazing flat screen TV we've got in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  We can see the fans. 
[00:48:00]  They can see us.  And it's growing.  They did it up right here in Philadelphia for us.  As it gets a little later and some of the, our audience is a later audience.  You know, they're not early risers.  Well, we're going to be here, we're going to be doing regular radio until 9.30.  And we're going to do our XM show probably until about 11.30.  So, yeah, plenty of time to come on down.  Yeah, you, you, you whiners.  To WISP, Fifth and Market.  Tickets, we've got lots of things to give away, including tickets for the Eagles and 
[00:48:30]  tickets to the show tomorrow at the Tweeter Center.  Actually, what we're going to do, Kenny, can you go outside?  Yes, sir.  We want to, we want to try to see what people would do to sit on the stage tomorrow night  at the Tweeter Center for the ONA Traveling Virus.  All right, there's a lot of freaks down there.  They got signs, they're dressed in costumes, there's, yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, it's  off the hook already.  Well, you want to go outside?  One guy's dressed like Ben Franklin. 
[00:49:00]  How did you know?  He's doing the walk with you.  Is he?  Of course.  Yeah.  Is he Ben Franklin for Philadelphia?  You've seen the Ben Franklin guy?  Yeah, we have seen him.  You've seen him walking around.  All right, well, go out there, Kenny, and see what they'll do to sit on the stage tomorrow  night.  Okay.  Well, what Ben Franklin guy?  It's the Ben Franklin guy that walks around early.  You remember back in the day, Tim Sabian took us on the tour of Philadelphia?  It was awful.  We had to follow his tight slacks and see nothing. 
[00:49:30]  He could barely walk because his slacks were so tight, and he had very comfortable, comfy  shoes with tassels on them, and he took us to Ben Franklin's house that's no longer there.  It's not a house, yeah.  It's just kind of a frame of where his house used to be.  Right.  And he took us there.  But then Ben Franklin walks around, and he just talks like he's Ben Franklin.  Yeah.  Just a little bit of wisdom comes out of his mouth there as he talks.  It doesn't.  Hey, we got Jimmy Schubert here. 
[00:50:00]  We should get him in.  Where's Doug?  Doug is smoking outside.  He just came up.  Want to bolt in?  Whatever.  I don't care.  We're just making up as we go here.  All right, Doug Stanhope back in studio.  Also, Jimmy Schubert getting a cup of coffee.  And Jimmy doing the gig with us tomorrow night, man.  Yeah, 10 comedians on that fine stage.  Jimmy Schubert, everybody.  Hey, what's going on?  Good morning.  We haven't seen you in about four years.  How's it been that long?  Had to have been.  We were off the air forever.  Yeah.  I saw you in Montreal last time. 
[00:50:30]  You were up there hanging with the...  Oh, okay, yeah.  That was like, you know...  Yeah, for the comedy festival up there.  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  So it hasn't been four years.  You're right.  It's been a couple of years, though.  A couple of years.  Yeah.  By the way, Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus.  We're just whoring ourselves out.  Everything is sponsored.  Why not?  I think my crap break was sponsored by somebody.  I'm in the bathroom.  Charmin.  Yeah, probably cement.  I'm in the bathroom listening to the WYSP feed.  Everything is sponsored.  Everything we do.  That's how it is.  Anthony's breathing sponsored by whatever. 
[00:51:00]  Why not?  But the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus sponsored by Bud Light.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.  And Jimmy Schubert's one of the comedians that will be on that stage.  Who is that creep?  Looking forward to it.  Who is that?  What is that?  I'm just like a six-foot guy in a mess, but he's all made up.  He's like some kind of...  What is that guy doing?  Hey, Doug, is your mic on, Doug?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Can someone check Mr. Stanhope's mic?  Try again.  Hello.  That creepy guy.  Can you hear us?  No, you're a little low in the mix there. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know.  You want me to get on the mic?  Yeah, try that, Mike.  Oh, yeah, get on that.  That's a good one.  All right.  Take the respirator off.  I think it's interfering with the...  How was your smoke break, Doug?  That was the best cigarette I've ever had.  Ever.  Yeah, I'm just starting to come to.  We got inexplicably drunk last night where you didn't think you drank that much.  And this morning, I woke up on the couch in the hotel.  I'm like, what room are we in?  I hate that.  We lost Coke.  Someone gave me the heavy-handed handshake. 
[00:52:00]  He gave me a lot of Coke.  Heavy-handed handshake.  Yeah.  And then it disappeared.  Do you ever have that problem where you go, like, I'm more terrified that we can't find  it because, like, that's when you go to the airport and you go, I don't have anything to  worry about.  Wait.  Someone handed me Coke and no one ever found it.  Oh, man.  Hey, that makes flying a lot of fun, though.  Yeah, that's why you panic when you get pulled over, when you think, well, I have nothing  to worry about.  How do you know?  Because there's some kind of, like, brown biker bathtub crank, you know? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, well, whatever it is.  Whatever it is, I'm sure it's illegal.  Yeah, next time I'm getting wanded, oh, this is for explosives.  Sure it is.  Yeah, I'm going to think, where's that Coke?  I never thought of that.  If it does get lost.  The heavy handshake.  We all think about those things right before you're going through security.  I look at, like, my laptop bag and go, was I using this for anything else, like a late  night hit or something?  I left a knife in there or a shank or something. 
[00:53:00]  You ever hook up on a chick who turns out to be, like, a heroin mule and you don't know  it until you pull your mule out and all of a sudden there's a bag of heroin hanging off  it?  You silly goose.  I was going to use the same word four times in that joke.  It still works.  A heroin mule, you pull out your mule, there's a bag of heroin.  Mule, mule, mule, mule.  And you say, ha ha, mule.  All right.  Well, they didn't bother you outside, though?  No, they were very kind.  They're all nice.  Yeah.  Hey, Doug, did you say that Irish women are too ugly to rape? 
[00:53:30]  Well, I said a lot more words than that.  Well, someone on the phone is saying, hey, Doug, about the Irish women or something.  Yeah, I got no problem over there in Ireland, but that was the gist of the bit.  I used a lot more words than that.  Did I just give the punchline like it's a whole buildup and then you finally ended like  that it was a longer version of the same point?  Yeah.  But yeah, they shortened it to that for the tabloids.  Oh, it made the tabloids?  Yeah.  Were you put off stage for that? 
[00:54:00]  Not really off stage because I refused to leave until they gave me the light.  I'd make sure I did my contractual obligation.  You got some set of balls, man.  I love it.  I love it.  He had to be over there.  The whole nation was wrapped up and there's some pedophile scandal where they had passed  some court ruling that allowed some pedophile to walk on a technicality and the whole country  was acting like their kid was next because this guy's out.  Oh, brother.  They were going to pull their kids out of Our Lady of the Glory Hall.  How many can he really get per day? 
[00:54:30]  I think your kid's pretty safe.  Yeah, when he's on the front page of every newspaper.  The guy with the coat over his head leaving the courtroom.  Yeah, he's out of the back.  The kids will be running over because you want to grab this?  Sure can, kid.  Here, hold this in your mouth.  Well, that's pretty cool, though.  So they were after you for that?  Yeah, it was one show.  It was my guy.  I don't know if he's my agent or my manager or whatever.  There was some guy that gets a cut of my money when I go over there.  But he's like the major spin doctor when it comes to the press. 
[00:55:00]  As soon as they started booing, that guy was already dialing up, setting up a press release.  What he meant was, what he said.  Well, no, no, he's getting press.  Why would some guy that no one knows you, he said something to the bar and people hated him.  How's that getting on the front page of a tabloid, Brian Hennigan?  Wow.  Nice.  You need that.  Still believe it, though?  Yeah, they were pigs.  I stand behind the comment. 
[00:55:30]  Absolute pigs.  You've been to Kilkenny, right?  Yeah, but I was actually over with Dom Herrera.  Yeah, I was with Dom, too.  The Bulmers Comedy Festival over there in Dublin.  Oh, Dublin.  Yeah, but Dom has that thing.  He said, you know, there's no in-between Irish women.  He said they're either absolutely stunningly beautiful or they're, you know, sea skags.  You know, there's no middle ground.  And with, you know, I know you, I don't, but they do look like you a lot. 
[00:56:00]  That's horrifying.  Wow, you look like an Irish woman.  They look like Jimmy with a wig, right?  Yeah.  They can't even breastfeed because they all have man breasts.  Oh, that was an uncomfortable bum.  Since I've never been there, I always assumed that they looked like the really pretty ones  you see in the movie with the red curly hair.  No, they're really misshapen.  I know it's your word.  Misshapen.  Really?  Yeah.  They're just, yeah.  And there's not a lot of pigment over there.  They wear, like, two tight shirts with a bunchy bra underneath, I guess. 
[00:56:30]  Ooh.  Yeah, it looks like an adult diaper under a tube top.  Do they have the butt within the butt going on the back?  You ever see the women that have the really wide asses?  Oh.  And then in the middle of the wide ass is a mini ass.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fantastic.  I can't stop staring at it.  I will look at a bad ass for longer than I'll look at a good ass.  I'll look at a good ass and go, that's a really nice ass on there. 
[00:57:00]  But a bad one, you look and just, I follow it in the mall and go, I'm flabbergasted.  You look at every detail, every little sunken part, the double ass, the crack, the wedgie,  everything.  That's how those chicks worry, where you stare like, what's wrong with her?  I know you're a girl, but there's something you're shaped differently than other human  beings, and I want to figure out what it is.  Just the other day, we were leaving New York, and my girlfriend was following me in her vehicle,  and I make a right turn onto 57th, and a mess was crossing the street, right in the middle 
[00:57:30]  of the crosswalk.  A mess.  Her ass was like beyond, I can't even describe it.  So I'm going around, I had to put my window down, and I'm pointing, going, I'm pointing  at her ass, because I wanted my chick to see that ass so bad, like to share it later.  And then I called her on the phone, in my truck, and go, did you see that ass?  It was horrid. 
[00:58:00]  And they're the ones that are always wearing the juicy wear.  That's the one.  No.  Nothing juicy about their asses.  There is nothing I want to see juiced.  When they wear the slacks, and it just looks like someone hit them in the ass with a bag  of nickels.  Oh, come on.  I've been sitting in a gravel driveway for a while, and just got up and brushed the gravel  off.  Jimmy, are you psyched for tomorrow, man?  Oh, yeah, I'm pumped.  I can't wait.  We're going to get close to 10,000 people out there tomorrow. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, that's going to be a good one.  Yeah.  Tickets out.  We should have had Doug on the show.  I'm not.  I don't think I'm a very good comic anymore.  I love Doug's honesty, man.  God damn.  I think I'm washed up.  Oh, come on.  You get to that point.  You know, throughout your career, every time you hit a low, you get to a point where you're  burned out on what you're saying, and you go, oh, I think I'm done.  I can't think of jokes anymore.  But you always rebound, and then you get to a point where you know you're always going 
[00:59:00]  to rebound from that, but then you realize that I'm almost 40 now, and you look at every  great career that lasted into the golden years, somewhere between great and dead suck  shows up.  Now you go, wait, do I suck now?  Because I don't know anyone who's funny in their 50s.  You know?  That's true.  There's very few.  And that's with a lot of apologies.  Well, he's old.  He doesn't know that.  Very few.  At least comedy, though, you can do that. 
[00:59:30]  There are guys that, like in rock bands and stuff, that still try after 40, and it's just  really sad.  Dude, we're still going to make it, man.  I know the guy that knows this guy over at the record company.  We're going to get a demo out of it.  It's like, dude, how many bands?  Yeah.  Huey Lewis was pretty much it.  Yeah.  He was talking to us last time about Cheap Trick's new album, and he's saying it's great.  And even if it was, no one would listen to it.  They would be completely discounted just because they're old. 
[01:00:00]  Because it's Cheap Trick, yeah.  Because it's Cheap Trick, yeah.  He's holding four guitars, and you're like, all right, what a douche.  I don't know what his record sounds like.  Yeah, you don't want to see that guy at 58, still cranking out with his checkered pants  on.  You see the reunion concerts of some of these older bands that get together, you know, hey,  that's what I want to see, the Doobie Brothers, you know?  The big one, Asia.  Remember Asia, the first super group?  Did they get back together?  They're back together.  They're playing now, man.  God.  Remember Asia? 
[01:00:30]  I'm scared because what if I'm on the downside now?  Like, what if I already hit the peak and didn't realize it?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Like, every time you have a bad show, you go, do I suck now?  I mean, is this permanent?  Because at one point, that suck isn't going away.  That is always what you're thinking.  But you've still got drugs to fall back on.  Yeah, I don't do drugs that often.  It's hard to do drugs on the road.  Like, Coke is the only one that you can even screw with on the road.  Like, that's comedy friendly, and that's only, like, the third show Saturday where you, like, 
[01:01:00]  I'm too drunk.  You've got to make sure you take it at the right time.  Yeah, exactly.  If you time it well.  Coke was never something I did, like, long term.  Like, that's probably why I never get addicted because I only do it when I'm really hammered  to stay awake, and then it just makes you drink far more than your body should be capable  of drinking, and you just feel, like, such manure in the morning that, yeah, I'm not  doing that for another month, another week. 
[01:01:30]  It's three show Saturdays.  It comes in handy for the three show Saturdays.  Remember three shows on Saturday night?  You were doing blow, and you weren't doing it, but you were there at Governors in Long  Island with Levittown.  Two of the Jets, Nick Lowry and Bobby Brister showed up.  We were doing a gig together at the end.  I was, like, 1996 or something.  Yeah, they were playing for the Jets at the time.  That was very cool because there was Dr. Dirty, John Valderick coming in, and these football  players were doing blow in the green room. 
[01:02:00]  He wasn't, Norton was there.  He wasn't doing blow, but I was.  He was like, you party?  I'm like, yeah, sure.  I'm doing coke with football guys, and the crowd was so violent, like the Dr. Dirty crowd.  F you, F you.  They're screaming at the guys just bringing in the piano, and there's two football players  back with me and Norton.  They're going, jeez, I wouldn't want to be you right now.  Like, I get to go out there and open for this clown, and football players are afraid  of these guys.  Coke just makes you do awful things, too, because we were in Kingston, New York, opening 
[01:02:30]  for the band Blotto.  So they did that song, I want to be a lifeguard.  Yeah, believe me.  And we were opening for them.  So that tells you how well we were doing at the time.  So they figured they would be nice.  And this guy had an eight ball, pulls it out, throws out some lines for us.  We go out on stage, do our thing, come back, realize his jacket was hanging up in the dressing  room, went, rifled through his pockets, took all his coke, and left.  Ah, I hope that's what happened to us last night. 
[01:03:00]  I just sweat every time we go through airport security.  But it's like the guy was nice enough to, you know, hey guys, you want to do a little?  And we just took all of his cocaine and left.  I've turned into such a pussy, though, man.  I got sober three years before the comment.  I don't know how anybody does it.  I'm like at a point now where I'm like, well, should I have a green tea?  Oh, I don't know, the caffeine is bad before the first show.  I should be shot.  A green tea.  I'm a mo.  What a mo.  I'm trying to do.  Wow.  Disgrace.  Hey, are we going to go outside and see what Club Sort of Kenny is all about? 
[01:03:30]  He's trying to find people to do something crazy for the show today.  Where is that Frankenstein?  Just to let these guys know.  There he is.  There's Kenny.  Lily.  Lily.  Grandpa.  I'm with the listeners.  Before we go to Kenny.  Ass.  We've got to bring these guys up to speed.  The last time we broadcasted live from WISP, we did this thing.  What would you do for whatever we were giving away?  I don't remember anymore.  Oh, no.  Bring the strangest thing you have to...  What happened?  What happened?  He just spilled coffee all over himself. 
[01:04:00]  Like an animal.  All over the front of his child-like shirt.  Like a light blue shirt and get coffee out of it.  What are you going, golfing after the show?  No, no, bro.  I tell you.  I packed light.  What can I tell you?  I went for my...  But the last time we broadcast live from WISP, we asked people to bring the strangest thing  they own down to the station.  And this guy came with a freeze-dried monkey with his mouth open.  It was a freeze-dried monkey in a bag.  In a bag.  I don't know what you would use it for.  Some kind of medical thing.  I don't know.  But, yeah, he brought that down. 
[01:04:30]  And we thought that was good enough.  You know, it's like, hey, the guy's got a freeze-dried monkey.  Yeah, come on up with a freeze-dried monkey.  But someone had to top it.  And since the monkey was freeze-dried in the position where his mouth was open, this  guy decided to...  Allegedly, we really don't know anymore.  I think we're past the statute of limitations on that one.  I don't know.  What is the statute of limitations on bestiality with a dead monkey?  Because that's what happened.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  That doesn't top having it.  Yeah, anyone can do that.  But you have to have it.  Yeah, but you have to have a freeze-dried monkey before you can rape it.  I think the guy who has it still wins.  Do you guys remember the mom that was outside, too?  Was she the one...  Allegedly, she came by with her baby in a baby carriage.  She had an infant in a carriage.  And she had one of our crazy listeners babysit the kid while she took care of one of our listeners  just out of nowhere.  Yeah, she was great. 
[01:05:30]  And she didn't know the listener.  It was just a good egg.  Yeah.  And the kid is crying somewhere else in the parking lot.  And the listener is babysitting as she's getting on her knees for another one of our fans.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, she's lovely.  So with that said, we're hoping to top some of these things today.  Club Soda Kenny's outside.  Kenny!  Hello.  Oh, that's great.  Back off the mic a little bit.  I'm sorry.  Hey, Kenny, can you stand frozen solid like a frozen monkey?  And open your mouth a little. 
[01:06:00]  How's the crowd, Kenny?  Frozen, frozen.  Look at this, mafoon.  How's the crowd, Kenny?  All right, listen, people want to do a lot of things I don't think we can describe on  the radio.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're trying to figure out how to say it on the radio.  Well, why don't you try right now?  You've got to be clever about it.  All right, could you read that?  I don't have my glasses.  Okay, Kenny.  You ever see him in his glasses?  Yeah.  What a creep.  When he called me about doing this show, I thought it might be a prank, because he  left that message with that voice, and I'm like, no one in charge of something has that 
[01:06:30]  voice.  He's just a ghoul.  He's supposed to look intimidating, but when he throws on his glasses, ah, forget it.  Steve, what's going on?  I look intelligent.  All right.  No.  What's that?  What's that Steinbeck novel?  You know, the girl?  No, of Mice and Men.  Of Mice and Men.  Yeah, that's that guy.  That's what he is.  Lenny.  Lenny.  All right, try to describe what these guys want to do. 
[01:07:00]  Well, the first one's easy.  We've got a guy named Pat who is willing to eat his own ear infection.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, I'm completely repulsed.  Beautiful.  I love...  I don't clear away from much, but that one.  I love how Steve still uses his radio voice to explain that, by the way.  Ladies and gentlemen.  The first person we got out here, that...  He wants to eat his own ear infection.  What?  We need a little detail on that one. 
[01:07:30]  Wait, didn't the cheerleaders just came out?  Hey, Pat, come here.  All right, Steve.  Yes, yes, I'm listening.  We've got to take a break here, so explain further what's...  Yeah, what does he have?  What's his ear infection all about?  Pat, come here.  This is Pat.  Pat has the ear infection.  Can you describe exactly what's going on?  It's like this pussy boogers that just come out of my ear and just leak all day.  It's been going on for a little while now.  Maybe I should go see a doctor.  Yeah, perhaps.  I'll get a finger full and I'll eat it up for you guys. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, God, I am so skeeved out.  We've got to throw it on a Ritz cracker or something, though.  Which ear is it?  We've got to let it drip onto a Ritz cracker.  Do you see anything, Steve?  In his ear?  I'm looking right now.  Do we have anybody...  Where does it come out of?  Ah!  Yeah, yeah, he's got a crusty, leaky ear.  Steve, smell it.  Smell it.  Yeah, it smells like...  Give it a good whiff.  Yeah, go ahead, Steve.  Smell it.  Smell it.  Smell it.  It's really disgusting.  It's like rotten meat.  By the way, Steve hates hanging out with the fans. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks.  They're going to eat meat.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes, of course it is.  Removed every ounce of toughness.  All right, Steve, what else we got out there?  We have a gentleman named Dave.  I'm going to say this.  A gentleman?  Where?  A fella.  He's willing to make his pants wet without jumping in a pool.  Okay.  You think that made it?  That's a pretty good description.  That's always fun to say. 
[01:09:00]  If he jumped in a pool, his pants would get wet all over.  But I'm sure he wants to do something where his pants will get wet in a specific area  just from him standing there, almost like magic.  Like magic.  Right.  There you go.  He's going to have to do that outside because that will get a nice reaction.  Yeah.  What else?  A guy named Mark would like to take some.  He's willing to go to a store, buy some glue traps,  and apply them to his very hairy chest or back and rip them off.  Now, we know how bad those glue traps are.  We've done that before. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  You put it on there.  It just rips the hair, the skin, some muscle tissue,  and perhaps an organ or two right through his ribs.  This is for a pair of tickets to sit on the stage.  Anything else, Steve?  Yeah.  We have Mark is also willing to do the Icy Hot Challenge  if the other one wasn't going to work.  All right.  A lovely lady named Ashley is willing to give Jimmy a back rub for tickets.  Ugly.  Ugh.  Ugly.  A back rub?  I didn't glove.  What does she look like?  Where is she?  Can't she get an ear infection? 
[01:10:00]  Where is she?  She's coming.  Let's see.  This is so cool.  We can check out the listeners.  Get a look at them.  Oh, cool.  You want to give me a...  Oh.  Wow, look at that.  Can you do a pop list?  Yeah, could you flash?  Oh, hey.  Just give a little flashage.  I think that works.  Wait, tell Ashley to describe what she wants to do.  Ashley, can you tell Jimmy exactly what you'd like to do to him?  Rub you down?  Well, that's really sexy.  I'd like to rub her back with my bumper. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Are you going to give him an ironic ending?  That's a happy ending where the irony is I punch you in the face.  All right.  With that, Steve, see what other people are willing to do for these tickets for the stage, okay?  I think we got...  We're off to a good start, though.  We're doing all right.  That's pretty good.  I think we want to see the guy eat his ear infection.  Ear infection.  We got to get a cracker or a piece of steak or something.  We got the gang from Morton's here. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, piece of steak.  No, that would make it too tasty.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no steak.  I also think if we can get him to do it, maybe we can get somebody else to eat his ear infection.  They get even something better.  Oh, God.  I can't even deal with this.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Oh, God.  We're going to be here all morning, by the way.  I'm so skeeved.  We're going to be here for at least another four hours, so it's Fifth and Market, WISP Studios, if you  want to stop by.  We got tickets to the O&A Traveling Virus.  We got tickets to sit on the stage, and we got Eagles tickets as well to give away today.  All right.  Jimmy Schubert in studio and Doug Stanhope. 
[01:11:30]  We got to take a break.  We'll be back.  It's the O&A Virus spreading across America.  Today, we say hi to Philadelphia.  O&A Party Robbins.  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  That sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is it?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:12:00]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'd like to call it the O&A Virus.  Jimmy Schubert in studio.  Doug Stanhope.  And Steve.  Steve, get on Jimmy's mic for a second.  Those are my headphones.  And those are yours.  All right, bud.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He doesn't like that.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  He's going to have a problem now all morning. 
[01:12:30]  No, I'll be fine.  Jimmy Schubert just used Anthony's headphones.  You might want to explain to Jimmy what that means.  Wait, I've got to get your mic on.  This might work.  Try that, Jim.  Yeah, that one works, Jimmy.  Testing, testing.  Is that good?  Am I on the radio?  Explain to Jimmy Schubert why that was bad that he just used Anthony's headphones.  Jimmy Schubert's a clean guy.  He's not a slob.  I don't have an ear infection.  Why would it be crazy?  He's not going to say it to your face. 
[01:13:00]  I put him right on.  Listen to Jim Norton and I.  He doesn't want you to wear the headphones because you consort with the Jew.  At least someone's making sense.  That makes perfect sense.  There you go.  Speaking of which, what do Mel Gibson and Hezbo have in common?  They both got bombed.  They made any semantic comments.  Oh.  Oh, geez.  It's a little political.  It was a little hurt.  It was a little hurt.  All right.  Steve's in the studio.  We're trying to figure out what this guy's going to do with the ear infection.  Yeah.  The more discussions we're having about this, the more skeeved out I'm getting. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  It's really big.  We have, well, we have Pat who's got the...  Unsavory.  By the way, Jimmy, enjoy your oatmeal.  I was just thinking that as I'm shoving oatmeal and I had to put a package and a half in  because I'm 38 and I didn't know how much water to apply to my oatmeal.  I really should be executed.  I feel like I'm eating out of Olivia Newton-John's bra.  Oh, man.  And the crowd goes wild. 
[01:14:00]  Very good.  All right.  So what do we got, Steve?  Okay, so we have Pat who's got the leaky ear infection.  Yeah, yeah.  And a couple of guys have volunteered to eat the ear infection.  Okay.  Now we've, I guess we've decided that eating it off a cracker or bread just wasn't good  enough because that would kill...  Dilute the flavor.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jimmy.  So what we suggest is...  We try it out in the lab, Jimmy.  We try these things out in the lab and we've decided it'll dilute the flavor. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  So what we're suggesting is that Pat scraped down his leaky ear with said plastic spoon.  Okay.  And then feed it to one of these other guys.  Well, doesn't Pat want the tickets to sit on the stage, though?  Sure, but we have, what, six or eight, I think?  Because he's going to eat his own ear infection.  Yeah.  And then we're going to get a complete stranger to eat his own ear infection.  That's pretty cool.  I mean, great.  I don't know if anyone's going to beat that today.  Wait, now, is it deep in his ear?  It's sort of on the surface, like right in the middle, it kind of leaks out the...  Steve, you watch until enough leaks out where it fills up the spoon. 
[01:15:00]  I mean, here's what I'm saying.  I don't want just a little bit.  Him licking his own ear infection is not as gross as someone else licking his own ear infection.  So I'm saying, is it possible for somebody else to scrape his ear and feed it to him,  and then he feeds them his ear infection on a spoon?  I mean, I'm just trying to mix it up a bit and be cute.  Or you could get some Q-tips and do it, like, on a stick, like an ear infection on a stick.  No, Q-tips would...  How many leaks does it take to get this into my ear infection?  No, I'm afraid the Q-tip will get stuck to the Q-tip. 
[01:15:30]  And we could scrape out some peanut butter, too, to, you know...  Out of the ear?  Yeah.  To really make it interesting.  Let's go nice and deep, pull a little brain matter.  All right, Steve, you're downstairs.  Let's get that done.  If you want to join us as we broadcast live from WISP, it's Fifth and Market here in Philly, okay?  Thank you for wiping my headphones down.  You're welcome.  Sweaty Lebanese ears.  All right.  Really fast.  This might be boring to people, but we got $10,000 up for grabs for one of the members of the staff.  We're doing football picks this year. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  Courtesy of Dish Network, right?  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  That's 1-888-GET-DISH.  The football picks are sponsored by the Dish Network.  This is what's going to happen.  Who's in on this?  Than?  Yeah.  Who else?  Steve, Eric, Travis, Dan.  Still a rabid Cowboys fan?  Bill.  Not rabid, though.  No, Jimmy really likes his Cowboys, man.  I was, but I stopped watching sports, really.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't take off to watch me.  When's the last time a stupid, stupid Eric Williams showed up at one of my gigs or another  cowboy that played in 94?  Well, at least you have the Cowboys, you know, with the Eagles. 
[01:16:30]  Power crashed this effing computer.  They played so bad last year.  Just power crashed it.  Janet Jackson stood a better chance of getting back to the Super Bowl.  What?  What happened?  God damn, I hate, I hate dealing with things that don't work.  We're all happy and you're mad over there.  What happened?  I'm trying to get PalTalk working for the people that love PalTalk.  Yeah.  Now plug it back in, please.  Thank you.  What happened?  I'm trying to get it working and I keep getting those errors and now the errors are so much  fun on Windows where it says, hey, you want to rat out your computer? 
[01:17:00]  Like every error that happens, like, oh, the program's got to close for some apparent  reason.  We're going to close the program.  And then you go, okay, close it.  Do you want to report that error?  Where is it?  Where are eight billion a day?  It happens to me, I swear to you, seven, eight times a day.  Realistic.  I'll say seven, eight times a day.  Let's say it happens to everybody three times a day, once a day.  How about just once?  How about a few hundred million people who's sitting there going, this guy seems to have 
[01:17:30]  had a problem.  He reported it.  Is anyone reporting the error?  And where does it go?  They have an error team.  Bull.  There is no error team.  It's ratting out your computer and it goes nowhere.  Five Asians in masks just looking over at mispronouncing words and bothering everyone.  And scared of their chickens in the yard.  Boring their firstborn teehee.  So we're trying to get the pal talk up.  All right.  So we're talking football.  What were you saying about the Eagles there, Jim?  I just said the Eagles played so bad last year.  Janet Jackson stood up at her chance of getting back to the Super Bowl than the Eagles. 
[01:18:00]  They were that bad.  But this year may be better.  All right.  Well, we're doing the football picks.  We got $10,000 up for grabs.  You want me to throw mine in?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm a big Lions fan.  Yeah.  No, not Detroit.  The ones that ate Christian.  Well, I have one, too.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  I was talking to a couple of the Jets and I said, how's the Super Bowl looking this year?  They said, ask Mabel King's shoes. 
[01:18:30]  See?  I get the double amputee joke.  Old pristine shoes.  Just sitting there looking sad in the closet.  Dust on them.  Well, whoever gets the most right during the season is going to win $10,000.  Here's the twist because it's a contest for the guys behind the scenes.  Yeah.  But I'm going to do the picks, too. 
[01:19:00]  But I'm just going to just do stupid picks every week.  Like stupid picks.  Yeah, like throw darts.  You're going to pick baseball teams?  Pull them out of a hat just to prove you can do well by just not even thinking about this.  And just coming up with dumb ways of picking the games.  I guarantee you win.  Yeah.  And if I do, if I win the $10,000, I want to throw it out of a helicopter or something to the listeners.  Really?  Or over in our city or over one of the cities we broadcast in.  Yeah, that'll be allowed.  Well, we'll figure out.  Fly over Manhattan.  Why not?  And throw money out. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Well, we'll figure out.  That's good.  We'll figure out some way.  But I'm just going to take the $10,000.  I think I'm going to rocket launch here.  I'm going to take the $10,000, hopefully in all nickels, and just throw it at our fans.  Maybe get a potato gun or something and just let it go.  That's what I do, though.  I'll give it to the fans if I win.  And I'm just going to do dumb picks, okay?  So the five games up for picking this week for the guys, it's the Falcons and the Panthers.  All right?  I'm picking the Panthers because I went on vacation in North Carolina this summer.  Oh, that's how you're picking it? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  So I'm picking the Panthers.  The Saints and the Browns were heard in Cleveland.  So I'm taking the Cleveland Browns this week over the New Orleans Saints.  Jets over the Titans.  I'm taking the Jets because that's my team in the end.  All right?  We're broadcasting from Philly, so I've got to go Eagles over the Oilers.  Oilers?  There's Oilers?  I mean, yeah, over Houston.  Wow.  Oh, the Houston Texans? 
[01:20:30]  How old are you?  How awful is that?  You know, I forgot they changed it.  No, they should be the Oilers.  They're Houston Texans.  It was always the Oilers.  Stop.  Texans is terrible.  They're just trying to get more people at the games.  Yeah, more jerseys sold.  All right.  And, of course, we're heard on WJFK, so I go Redskins over Minnesota.  There's my picks for no real good reason.  All right?  There.  There you go.  And we'll have the results on Monday, and we'll do this every week.  That's all.  It's over.  Dumb bit.  Done.  But thank you, Dish Network, for giving us the $10,000, okay?  Per game? 
[01:21:00]  Uh, yeah.  Can you imagine?  For the whole season.  Steve!  We're going to get back outside to Steve.  So the roof didn't really help that much, I guess.  I know, I know, I know.  I know, I know.  I know, I know, I know.  Wow.  There's Steve.  There it is.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, guys.  Hey, by the way, Big A is in the front row, I see.  Why don't we get Big A on the microphone for everybody in Philadelphia?  This is Big A.  By the way, Jimmy Schubert, Doug Stanhope, this is our latest creation.  You're going to love this guy. 
[01:21:30]  Big A.  Yes, Hopi?  Say hi to Jimmy Schubert and Doug Stanhope.  He's trying to say hi, by the way.  Hi.  Shut up.  Hi, Jimmy Schubert and Stanhope.  He has a real problem with the S-T words. 
[01:22:00]  What is he wearing?  I don't know.  That looks like the stuff that covers a hooker's body when they find it in a little ditch.  All right.  Big A is going to do the news or a couple of news stories for everybody outside a little  later on the show.  Big A, how are you doing, though?  You took off work or are you working at this point?  Telemarketing.  Actually, I took off today and took the train to Philly. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you tell Doug and Jimmy what you do for a living?  You're going to love this one.  I drive a private cab in the Bronx.  In the Bronx.  He drives a private cab.  A private cab.  He's unlicensed.  He's just a fat man with a car.  That's the cab that will talk to you for the whole trip. 
[01:23:00]  You have to lean in.  You can't understand.  Don't talk to me.  But you're afraid to offend him, though, because he's a bloody child seeker in the front seat?  Yeah, you can read it in his new book.  He's finally overcome his crippling shyness.  All right.  Steve, are we ready for the ear infection thing?  Yes, I believe we are.  Okay.  Jimmy, I don't want to see this.  Yeah.  Norton, but...  I'm not usually this squeamish, but this is really disgusting. 
[01:23:30]  I think I'm going to vomit at the point.  I love looking at you, but I've got to look at the ear infection guy.  All right, Steve.  Get closer to Doug.  We're watching this.  That's perfect.  Steve, we're watching this, but tell everyone what's going on.  Of course.  Well, this is Pat, and Pat has told me now  that if he gets the implement into his ear deep enough...  Yeah.  ...he could actually pull out sort of like a snot.  Okay.  All right, listen.  Why don't we get to know Pat?  What does he do for a living?  What's he all about there, Steve?  I'm sorry, what? 
[01:24:00]  What is Pat all about?  We want to get to know him a little bit.  Here you go, Pat.  Pat, what's your story?  Where are you?  I've been...  I'm living in York, Thursday.  I just moved down here a year ago.  I live in Philly now, working on trucks.  Just took the day off to come down here with you guys.  All right.  And did he ever get this ear infection thing checked out?  Pat, have you ever had this ear infection checked out by, say, a medical professional?  Yes.  It was all clogged up.  They gave me medication.  They said, now it's going to break up, and it's going to ooze out.  What is it, swimmer's ear? 
[01:24:30]  What do you got?  Yeah, what happened?  What did Tommy Morrison bleed into your ear?  What do you got, truck driver ear?  I don't know.  What's going on?  Holding my head underwater all summer, I guess.  So, I don't know, I just can't get the job done.  All right, let's get some stuff out of your ear.  This is for tickets to sit on the stage.  Why don't you use a straw?  Yeah, that's not...  Do we have a straw we can suck it out with?  He's right.  He's got...  No, because it might get lost in the straw, too.  I'm afraid it'll get lost.  All right, look.  We're looking at it right now.  We got the camera on his ear.  Hold on.  Take this little in-screen thing down. 
[01:25:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  Spill it!  Yeah, good angle on his chin.  Well, tell whoever's got the remote.  Don't yell at Anthony, Steve.  Yeah, Steve is...  All right, how much stuff is on that...  Hold on.  I can't see.  Hold on.  It really looks like a wet booger.  Like a runny booger of clear yellowish liquid.  Cool.  That came out of his ear?  It certainly did.  He's a good boy.  Are we filming this for the website? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, we got two cameras on it right now.  All right, cool.  This will be up on opianthony.com later this weekend.  Steve.  Yeah.  Can you get more out of there?  You think you can get more?  This is really disgusting.  All right, he's going to get more out.  Why doesn't he put that on a spoon?  Put that on a spoon, what he's gotten out of his ear so far.  Sure.  All right, he's scraping it onto the spoon.  Ooh, we'll harvest.  I see.  Oh, God.  We're harvesting the ear infection out of his ear.  Now go in and get more of it.  It looks like a brown booger. 
[01:26:00]  All right, he's...  There better be enough for another person in there.  Tell him not to eat at all, greedy.  All right, he's digging deep into his ear.  Don't shoot your brain, dude.  All right.  Did he get more out, Steve?  Yeah, he did.  Is the spoon filling up a little bit?  Yeah, the spoon's got a nice layer of gook on it.  I see it from here.  Nice.  All right, who's going to eat this?  By the way, we're looking for what you will do to sit on the stage tomorrow night at the 
[01:26:30]  Tweeter Center for the ONA Traveling Virus.  God, I'm going to vomit.  Sponsored by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  All right, Steve, are we ready to do this?  Yeah, yeah, we are.  Now...  Oh, look at it.  It's gross.  Wow, it looks like a little bit of oatmeal.  That all came out of his ear?  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  Big ear.  It looks like a nice dollop of peanut butter.  What are you saying?  A chunk of brain.  All right.  Wait, the picture in picture.  How do we get that off?  Now, Pat originally wanted to eat his own. 
[01:27:00]  Do you want to stick with that, or do you want to have somebody else eat it?  Well, I think...  You've got to go with somebody else, no?  Well, he wants the tickets, though.  What does he get?  Well, we've got to get him tickets somehow.  You've got to take care of me.  You've got to take care of me.  I'll eat it, and somebody else eat it, whatever.  All right.  Getting someone else to eat it is beyond...  That's like almost borderline inhuman.  Oh.  I would rather see someone else eat it.  All right.  Yeah, someone else.  All right, let's get a stranger to eat...  We'll give it to him, just because hopefully he's got brain cancer.  Yeah, we'll...  I'm trying to frame up Mark here.  Steve, what's his name?  Mark? 
[01:27:30]  Mark.  You're going to eat that off George Harrison's spoon.  I think we've actually met Mark before.  I think Mark was an Assault on the Media contest winner.  Okay.  Hey, how you doing?  Mark, you ready to eat this?  Oh, yeah.  Now, I don't know if anyone's going to beat this today.  If you eat this, you have a really good shot at sitting on the stage tomorrow night.  Hey, I'll do whatever it takes.  Are we videotaping this outside?  Yeah, we are.  Okay.  All right, Steve, we'll take it away, Steve.  You got it.  Hey, I think he has to kind of turn around a little bit so the fans can check out the reaction here. 
[01:28:00]  It's got to be on his tongue.  He has to stick his tongue out with the stuff on it.  Yeah.  All right, here's the setup.  Here's the setup.  He's got a spoonful of his own ear infection, and he's going to feed a complete stranger this ear infection.  All right, now, don't swallow it all at once.  Don't swallow it all at once.  Hold it in your mouth and swirl it around.  There you go.  Oh.  Oh.  It's on his tongue.  It's on his tongue.  The spoon is clean. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, he's going to puke.  Ear infection.  So does Stan Hope.  He's got a garbage can in front of him.  Oh, my God.  Quick, somebody eat it.  All right.  Yeah, collect that.  We can use it for the next contest.  Oh, my God.  That is horrific.  What does it taste like?  It tastes like rotten wax.  Oh.  Rotten wax.  Rotten wax.  Spoiled meat and wax of another guy's ear infection.  All right.  These guys are going to get something for doing that.  Oh, hopefully it's hepatitis.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  It's going to get something.  All right.  Very, very good.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right.  Anybody else want to do something for the tickets out there, Steve?  We're going to ask around, yes.  Okay.  All right.  We should take another break.  Oh, he's got more.  He's digging in there.  Good boy.  Get in there.  Yeah, he's digging.  Dig farther.  Be a person.  He's digging for more ear infection.  Wait, wait, wait.  Every time he pulls something out, the crowd goes nuts.  What's he got, Steve?  What's he got, Steve?  Oh, dude.  A pussy booger-looking thing just out of the middle of his ear.  Hold it up.  Just out of the middle of his ear. 
[01:29:30]  Wait.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold it up.  Tell him to hold it up.  Yeah.  Put it right to the camera.  Let's see so we can see.  Hold still.  Hold still, Steve.  Oh, my God.  Up.  Up a little bit.  Where is it?  Oh, God.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  I can't look.  Oh, I'm going to throw up.  What is that?  That's somebody's lunch.  That looks like a slump.  It looks like a worm, a white tapeworm, is coming out of his ear. 
[01:30:00]  It looks like someone hacked up a piece of lung butter and just pumped it in his ear.  Dude, you've got something wrong with you.  Go to the hospital immediately.  You have porno girl face ear.  Oh, my God.  It does.  All right.  Save that for after the break.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wait.  Don't let him tell him not to lose that.  No, he won't lose it.  Save that for after the break.  That is what we were looking for.  The other thing was impressive.  Oh, God.  I'm going to risk.  The brown peanut butter substance.  Oh, where's my water?  But the slug that just came out of his ear.  Leave it there.  No, don't mess with it.  Leave it there.  Yeah, don't touch it. 
[01:30:30]  Don't even look at it.  Did it fall on the floor?  I think the guy's got more.  Well, Jeff, tell him to get that one.  I told you.  That one was the winner.  Yeah, get it off the floor.  Pick it up off the ground.  Pick it up.  Get it off the ground.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  What?  Are they afraid of germs?  They're going to eat an ear infection.  They don't want a piece of gravel.  Oh, what was that?  I told them.  What the hell was that?  It's a slug.  It looks like snot pretty much.  White snot.  Did they get it?  Save it.  Yeah, all right.  I saved it.  Thank God.  He saved it.  It's cold.  And somebody will be eating that next row. 
[01:31:00]  Atta boy.  By the way, really fast.  We're going another half hour today on commercial radio.  We did this yesterday.  We're doing it today.  So for everybody here in Philly and across America, an extra half hour, Opie and Anthony,  if you're listening to us on commercial radio.  And we want to thank General Motors for doing that for us.  Right, Ant?  Absolutely.  They're introducing what?  100,000?  100,000 miles of coverage.  Okay.  And a new level of confidence.  Learn more.  Just go to GM.com.  All right.  They're the ones helping us out here so we can go long. 
[01:31:30]  So we can watch guys eat ear infections.  Wonderful.  Hey, we got Gino.  I saw Gino outside the studio.  Oh.  He's a class act, man.  We got, I mean, Joey Vento from Gino's.  Yeah, Joey Vento from Gino's.  This guy, have you talked to this guy, Jimmy?  No, this is the guy with the sign that said order in English.  Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.  Love that.  Love that.  He's awesome, and we'll talk to him next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're live from WYSP in Philly.  Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:32:00]  Most of us get here on time.  We're just back, guys, on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people.  It's the battle of the mental illness.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll love us.  Do I sound better like this, or am I talking to it better like that?  I have no idea. 
[01:32:30]  These mics are different.  Wait.  One end works, and the other end doesn't work, so I'm talking like this, and I'm seeing which  end works.  Oh, no, that's no good.  No, they both work.  Perfect.  That's much better.  All right.  Up and clear.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show live from Philly from the studios of  WYSP.  A lot of people outside.  You can join them.  We're going to be here until at least 11, 1130.  We're at Fifth and Market.  That was really gross with that guy in the ear infection.  Yeah.  Timmy, you went outside and saw what he's got going on?  Yeah.  I looked inside the spoon, and Kenny described it well. 
[01:33:00]  It looks like semi, it looks almost like gray poop hot mustard.  It's like it's been liquefied.  You can snort that or lick it.  Like in the Wrath of Khan when a guy put the bug in the ear?  It's kind of like that.  They put creatures in our bodies.  Oh, Captain Kirk, they put creatures in our bodies.  It was gone. 
[01:33:30]  What, Kenny?  Horrible.  And Paris Hilton?  I don't know.  Your mic is...  What's happening to my mic now?  I don't know.  Your mic's crapping out a little bit.  Turn it sideways and fix it.  It's buzzing.  Buzzing.  All right.  Now it's back.  It's okay.  Hey, we got Joey Vento here.  Wait.  We got some important information.  Club Zoda Can.  We got a medical person with a diagnosis if you want to.  Yeah.  We would love to know what that is.  All right.  Just get him to the mic.  He doesn't have to breathe on me.  Whatever you do, don't eat it.  I hope.  I hope, God.  Where are you?  I hope there's death in his future. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, please tell me you can get AIDS that way.  Here's the official diagnosis.  It's Gastroenter Reuters.  Wait.  No.  Get on mic.  Who are you?  Get on mic.  I'm a friend of Jimmy Shrewars.  I'm Mike Feiland.  I'm an ER nurse.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got to turn the mics on.  We have a lot of mics here.  Yeah.  We got about 10 mics.  All right.  What's your name?  Mike Feiland, a friend of Jimmy Shrewars.  I'm an ER nurse.  All right.  So now we can do the contest again.  So, yeah.  You basically can get gastroenteritis because you're eating live bacteria.  Right.  I mean, so it'd be kind of like getting food poisoning. 
[01:34:30]  You're eating like a lot of bacteria.  You get nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  You can get pretty sick.  Yeah.  And your ear can turn out just like that guy's whose ear you ate.  Now, what's wrong with the guy's ear?  Oh, it sounds like he's got like an otitis externa.  It's an external ear infection, outer ear infection.  Like swimmers here?  Well, how about he fixes it?  It's an inner ear infection that you don't get drainage.  Wouldn't some antibiotics cure that right up?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely got to get some antibiotics.  What the hell is he waiting for, that ass?  Yeah, Jefferson's five blocks away. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, well.  They'd write him a prescription.  In a couple of days, it would start going away.  They're up in a couple of days.  Yeah, but then he'd steal his hook.  That's it.  If he had no viscous pus dripping from his head, he'd have no pickup lines.  Hey, baby, you want to see this?  Want to see something?  That's his take my wife, please.  So the guy that ate it is going to live.  No big deal.  Oh, he'll live, yeah.  He might get a little sick.  He might get a little sick.  He might get a little sick.  He might get a little sick.  He might get a little sick.  He might get a little sick.  He might get a little sick.  So he's not going to be able to enjoy the show.  He'll be puking the whole time while we're trying to do the ONA Traveling Fire. 
[01:35:30]  As opposed to us that we're watching it?  Yeah, I know.  I think Scotch will take care of that.  All right.  Yeah, there was a lot of dry heat.  See, he does a couple of shots of Scotch.  That'll kill that.  Yeah.  All right.  We should get Joey in here.  Yes.  Here he is.  I'm sure he appreciates the segue straight from the ear pus eating to his restaurant.  This guy is a hero.  Joey Vento.  Hey. 
[01:36:00]  Hey.  Here, I got some coffee mugs, a little few pens here.  You know, whatever you want.  Right on, man.  How about food?  You're thinking of eating a little?  I want to try one.  Are you kidding me?  I've never eaten one.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, grab it.  I have dreams about those sandwiches.  I gave you to American cheese.  That's what I was told.  Yeah, grab it.  Like the cheese that was coming out of his ear, Jimmy.  Cherry peppers.  Nice.  Cherry peppers.  Thanks for cherry peppers.  Everybody speaks English, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's get that point down.  They're all circumcised.  Give me those. 
[01:36:30]  Jimmy.  Check out his tattoos, Jimmy.  Check out his tattoos.  You got the real deal.  These are the real tats, man.  Wow.  Where'd you get all these?  I got these, believe it or not, eight years ago.  I didn't start riding the bike until I was...  These are my dream things.  But in my day, if I was smacking you, you didn't get no tattoos.  You really just got your tattoos?  Yeah.  They look like old school tattoos.  Yeah.  They look cool.  These are what I always wanted as a kid.  Right.  That my dad would smack me.  Not getting it.  So now, I'm a kid now.  Maybe that's just how tattoos look on old people.  And I feel like I'm 18. 
[01:37:00]  I'm a kid.  Like, you know, this was Johnny Humor, our little rebel friend in the cowboy show.  You probably don't remember.  No, no.  In the 50s and 60s, you know.  The snake, you know, there was always no Joey the Snake, so I finally got that done.  And here, I got my little Joey.  That done.  That's your Gino Stakes.  Hi, girl.  Oh, yeah.  In case I get lost, I got the Gino Stakes.  Yeah.  Hey, we're talking to a lot of people, so for the people that haven't heard, what happened  with you, with Gino's?  And, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, just give us the ABCs of the sign and everything. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, with the Speak English sign.  Yeah.  Well, what happened there?  In case people haven't heard the story, that's all.  Well, what's happened over the years, you know, a lot of my business people, we got together  and we started saying, we're having a problem with communication.  Orders are getting misinterpreted.  And they say, well, it's this language.  You can't get people to speak English, you know.  It don't have to be fluent English.  We never said that.  I don't speak fluent English, you know me, so nobody ever asked that.  So I said to myself, you know, let's research and see what we can do, because we're having  a problem just as a business sense.  And I happened to run across Theodore Roosevelt, 1907, the 26th president of the United States. 
[01:38:00]  All I did was dissect his bill on immigration.  And in so many words, it says, to be an American, you must be an American and nothing else.  Because if you're going to say you're something else, then you're not that true American.  Now, I took that to be as a, I'm an Italian.  I am not an Italian-American.  I am an American of Italian descent.  And so I took it.  Then he says, you have to be loyal to one people, and that's the American people.  And that's Joe Evento.  I'm loyal to the American people.  I can care less about anybody else.  We have room in this country for one language. 
[01:38:30]  That's the English language.  I'm all for that.  So I said, let me put this little sign out.  First of all, we've got to clarify something.  Nobody's ever been refused.  You can point.  You can mumble.  But we have these long lines.  And to be able to move the long line, you have to be able to communicate.  And how hard is it to say cheesesteak?  I mean, I'll teach you that first.  And then come next week, I'll teach you how to say American cheese.  So we're going to teach you two words at a time.  Yeah.  But they made this big issue.  Well, it started out with Jim Kenny, the councilman.  And here's a guy that's probably been eating at my store for 20 years when he grew up. 
[01:39:00]  And the sign I said originally was up for six months, but it really was up for at least nine months, and I got the proof on that.  That being said, my question to Jim Kenny was, why didn't it disturb you nine months ago?  Then we have the people that say, well, Joey, you did that for publicity, which is so far from the truth.  You don't need the publicity.  Well, if that's okay.  I mean, if that's it, then you tell me I'm a prophet because I put this up in September, figuring in June, you're going to have this immigration problem.  And I'm going to sneak in.  I'm going to become instant.  The timing was beautiful because everyone was talking about immigration.  Right.  What happened, all I did was say what everybody was thinking. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  I put my money where my mouth was.  They came down, threatened a lawsuit.  Can you tell everyone what the sign said?  Because it was correct.  All right.  Here's what the sign says.  This is America.  Please speak English when ordering.  And that's it.  It doesn't say if you don't speak, you're not going to get served.  Right.  It just makes it a lot easier because if you come in with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're going to get whatever I feel it is.  And that's the next thing that's coming off the grill.  So it could be a problem with onions.  And in your terms, you're saying I wanted to whiz without. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, here you are.  You've got a problem with onions.  You're going to go back and say, you know what?  That's not what I own.  I think I better learn English.  I mean, that's what the ethic is.  Nobody's ever been refused.  What about the retarded?  What about them?  They want to do things.  You said cheese thing.  Then we go.  Then we'll point and we'll show.  We help everybody there.  But like I said, all that was is to help move it.  That's what they think.  They got pretty pictures for the retards.  Is it true that they just got a point?  Yeah.  I get mail all over the country.  In fact, the world. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  In support of me.  They took ratings.  I think in the country was 90% rating approval on all the TV shows.  The lowest rating was on, I think, the Lindor.  That was 94%.  CNN, which is a very liberal station, gave me a 96% approval rating.  So I say to President Bush, I would like to meet him and sit down with him and let him understand.  Maybe I could change his way a little bit.  Good luck.  Because the fact, he's not listening to the American people.  Is it true you had a sign, thank you for being circumcised? 
[01:41:00]  No?  I heard that's a rumor.  Okay.  That's a rumor.  All right.  You should have a new sign every week at your place, Gino.  No, but seriously.  Joey, Joey.  You take a guy like Jim Kenney.  You know, he'd come back at me saying it was very shameless what I said about these people.  What people?  You know, how they bring the Spanish to begin with.  What people?  When I first said this.  To anybody.  I said everybody.  I named my own group.  The Italians, the Koreans, the Vietnamese, Russia.  I named them, but they never put that in.  The Daily News and the Inquirer, them scumbags. 
[01:41:30]  They came back.  The only reason, they never used the word please, by the way.  I can't believe Bushmore.  I didn't meet with you.  And they say, you know how I'm against the Spanish people.  Yeah.  So my question then was, well, the Daily News Inquirer, answer me this.  What section of the paper's in Spanish, you hypocrites?  Yeah.  Hey, they're animals anyway.  Let them lose their cheese sticks.  By the way, wait a minute.  I got to answer your question.  What section of the Spanish?  The police blotter.  Yeah.  You're right there.  But seriously, we enjoyed that a lot. 
[01:42:00]  What's happened, the country's in a serious, serious uproar, and I think I kind of brought  it to what said.  I became their leader, and I'm taking it to the grave with me.  Right.  So who was insulted, by the way?  Because if the sign was up for nine months, who?  I don't know.  We never had a problem, so I still got Spanish coming over.  It seemed to be guilty white people.  Here's the thing.  There's a do-gooder that came in, saw the sign, decided to make a big deal, even though  the thing was there for nine months.  My question to them was, they said it was discriminating.  I said, how is that?  Well, I debated a Spanish teacher on this one.  She said, well, you got to understand, Spanish people, they don't speak the English. 
[01:42:30]  Excuse me, can I stop you there?  Is it?  She said, yeah.  If you don't speak it, you can't read it.  Exactly.  That means the sign means nothing to you.  Uh-oh.  Our live audience is starting to look like Greta Van Susteren's audience during her show.  Look at that.  Why would you put up the sign if the people that you're trying to say that to don't speak?  Why have the sign?  Well, maybe.  Kind of a waste of a sign?  Well, here's the thing, then.  Maybe I'm trying to say this point deep down the side.  That, one, I took Theodore Roosevelt and say, I'm a true American. 
[01:43:00]  I speak the English language.  I believe in loyalty to the American people.  So maybe I took it that way.  Now, if you've read it, no matter what nationality you are, and if you've read it to say, well,  this is America, speak English for an order, and you took that to be offensive, then just  maybe you might not be that true American that you claim to be.  Oh, I don't claim to be a true American.  I'm saying that you don't speak English.  You don't read English.  It doesn't mean nothing.  So your sign is wasted on the people you're trying to speak English.  Now, the only ones that would do it when they said it became racist, that was the next 
[01:43:30]  thing.  I said, well, excuse me, one of the things that come into this country, you must learn to speak  the English language.  Well, that's their argument.  Everybody wants to make it a racist issue, and it's not.  That's right.  You know, it's like someone breaking into my house and going, hey, oh, you caught me inside  your house, but I'm going to do all the jobs that you don't want to do.  Right.  Just let me stay here, and I'll just clean the house.  I know you don't like to clean, but I'll do it.  You don't like taking the garbage out, right?  I said it.  I don't care if you're Canadian or you're Belgian, especially the Belgians.  If you're going to come here, speak the English language.  Well, the thing that's happening now, the people are in an uproar with the Spanish 
[01:44:00]  for the simple reason.  And, you know, I always make a statement that the second generation picks up, and they throw  that in my face.  Well, Joe Evento, you're the first one to say the second generation are the ones that  prospers.  Why won't you give these people their second generation a chance?  One, because my father was second generation.  When he went to school, there was no choice between Italian and English.  It was strictly English.  Tough love.  You learn English.  Every story you want, English.  You were forced to learn it.  Here, you're giving them their crutch. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, I got an option of doing Spanish.  They're going to allow me.  So, there's second generations who are possibly going to be on welfare, and I don't want to  thank for that.  All right.  Joey, for president.  How long?  And let's not kid each other.  It's not like the people from Philadelphia have to ban the Queen's English.  Spanish during the Spanish-American War when he charged that hill.  What was that hill?  What hill?  San Juan.  San Juan Hill.  San Juan Hill.  Yeah.  Do you think he was going, how do you say charge in Spanish?  They don't charge.  They just yell, steal.  I don't know if he's aware of what the Californians trying to pass with the governor. 
[01:45:00]  That's got to be driving you nuts, right?  How long did it take, like, your relatives to learn 500 plus the VIG?  Like, they learned that real fast, right?  You know, I hate to see somebody's wife or daughter get stranded and go to a gas station  for directions.  Oh, forget about it.  No speaking the English at $10.50, please.  How the hell did you know I was speaking English to begin with?  Joey's on top of this stuff.  Because you're not at $10.50, though, huh?  Joey, how many people have you whacked in your life?  Whacked? 
[01:45:30]  I can't say that.  Look at them.  I'll tell you during the commercial.  Come on, guys.  How many people have to put on the concrete shoes when you were around?  No, he's the tap shoes.  The concrete tap shoes.  He's the real dealer, this guy.  No, seriously.  The people in the country are really fed up.  All right.  We get all that, but we want the update.  So they saw the sign.  There was an uproar.  The politicians got involved here in Philly.  They threatened to try to...  They may be famous worldwide now.  Right.  And my business increased at minimum 40%. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, see?  And you weren't scared as they were threatening protesting?  No way.  They threatened to close me up.  Right, right.  You know, revoke my privilege license.  I said, here's what I'm going to tell you right now.  I'll say it again.  Listen to this.  This is the greatest statement ever.  Go ahead, Joey.  Revoke my license.  I'll board the place up.  I'll let it decay.  I'll never sell it and give you the ghetto neighborhood that you want.  I could have retired 15 years ago.  I do this because I love it.  I love America.  I said, you know, my family wasn't the greatest.  They didn't always buy by the law.  But only in America will they bypass that as long as you become a good citizen. 
[01:46:30]  They won't hold that against you.  So all these people, these wimpy whiners and...  Oh, let's just say it, Joe.  Go to work.  Go to work.  Let's go to work.  Joey holds all the cheesesteak eaters in his pockets like so many nickels and dimes.  Just ask you to let us wet our beaks.  Seriously, they can change...  Everybody writes me every day how to change things.  Well, you are a leader. 
[01:47:00]  And like I said, I'm taking that role.  I'll take it to the great.  Anthony, speak Italian to Joey there, will you?  I'm not going to be Greek.  Do you mind if we speak Italian?  That's what I'm trying to say.  I was going to say, if I was to go to Italy, you think they're going to roll over and say,  oh, he's German, we speak English?  No, Joey Vento better have a cue card or an interpreter.  And I wouldn't expect them to roll over.  I'm in their country.  I play by their rules.  Exactly.  We're in America speaking English.  So guess what?  Go back.  Then there's a few things we've got to change.  One, when they come over, you know, that girl, the illegal one.  She pops your baby out. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, now it's a citizen.  Oh, mommy's got to stay with the baby.  We can't let the baby without mommy.  Then mommy says, oh, I can't.  I can't have my legal.  But that's how I feel.  Husband here.  And then he comes over.  He wants, can't we have our own family?  Because we're paying.  We're getting everything free.  I say, no, pick the baby up and go back to Mexico.  But that's how I feel about just any American or whatever having children.  Well, I don't have children.  I respect the planet more than a crowd and even more.  And you're going to blow out eight kids.  I don't care if you're American, Italian.  If I have to pay for your schooling.  Yeah.  And not to mention the fertility drugs. 
[01:48:00]  We're going to pop them out nine at a time instead of getting bigger.  And I still have to.  Yeah.  I'm still paying for their public schooling and their health and blah, blah, blah.  I don't care if you speak the language or not.  I don't even know my neighbors.  I don't care.  I don't talk to anybody.  And Blockbuster won't even run NC-17.  Only are.  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  Yeah, you know.  Seriously, in California, I know he's been following him with the students out there.  Oh, yeah.  The illegal students.  Oh, yeah.  They're waiting for him to sign, what, by the 13th or something? 
[01:48:30]  The governor's got to sign his bill for illegals to be able to get financial aid and loans.  I love that.  I love that.  Give me a break here.  You got people over here.  If they make $10 over the quarter, oh, you don't qualify.  Give me a break.  I love the fact that Vento brings in cheesesteaks, so we all have our mouth full, so he gets out.  Yeah.  That's how he does.  You know he's now a man of every few words.  That big march downtown LA, 400,000 illegals.  And that was different how than any other day.  There's 400,000 illegal immigrants.  Everybody tries to pull words. 
[01:49:00]  Joey, you know, you're an immigrant from immigrants.  No, I'm not knocking them.  I'm just saying play by the rules like everybody else do.  We got people waiting 15, 20 years to get in here legally.  What mess is he, Bush?  If he says this amnesty, terrible, terrible thing for this country.  What are you saying to all the people who play by the rules?  I mean, what happens if everybody in Florida starts mugging?  Do we say, oh, let the mugging go.  We can't enforce it because everybody's doing it?  No, no, no.  I believe the law.  I say we build a wall and we hire the illegals to build it.  Right.  A little bit for everybody. 
[01:49:30]  Joey, how does this end in your world?  Do you start an army?  What do you want?  Well, first of all, we got to secure these boards with that wall.  It's correct there, you know.  Yeah, and I say to everybody out there, if they really believe in what I'm saying and  I'm hoping they do, I say go to your politicians, the ones that are running, and Jim Kenney is  number one on the list.  And I say, you hear that, Jimmy?  I hope you're listening.  Jim Kenney, you won't see him no more.  Set him up with a hooker.  If they're not against building the wall and they're not against his amnesty, vote them 
[01:50:00]  out of office.  Put anybody else in there but them.  Why not just end all the things that illegal aliens are coming here for?  All the welfare state.  Why don't you end that?  Well, it's a very simple project.  I don't know if you follow.  Come on.  Happy Kenney had it done right.  First of all, you got to build that wall.  Second of all, you got to go after these businesses.  And I'm dead against them hiring these people, you know what I mean, substandard slave wages  over there.  And they're putting that money in their pocket.  They're not giving it back to anybody. 
[01:50:30]  So maybe you put them in jail for a week or two.  Let me see.  I guarantee they won't hire illegals after that.  And second, when a cop, I hate to interrupt you.  I know it's your shot.  I don't know.  But seriously, when a cop stops on buying anything, they're not legal here.  Deport them.  If they got a criminal element, deport them.  I'll help pay for them.  Don't put them in jail and we got to pay.  No, put them back to Mexico.  All right.  Jimmy, you were saying.  I was just going to say, I love that they can come to this country and protest in this  country.  If they did it in their own country, they'd be thrown in jails or beheaded like some 
[01:51:00]  of these Muslims do in Europe.  They protest.  And they could only come to this country and do it in these countries.  In their own countries, they'd be dead.  And the important thing to remember, like a lot of places like Pittsburgh, like.  So are you saying that you should be like other.  Sorry.  That's right.  No, I was just saying that Pittsburgh, there's a big thing going on because I'll be there the  28th or 30th at the improv.  And I just, I think the important thing there is we're going to rally after the show.  I'm glad you said that.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  And by the way, Joey brought notes, it looks like.  Let's hear it.  I want to give somebody a few notes on Mexico's immigration laws. 
[01:51:30]  Everybody over here?  Oh, let's hear this.  I want to hear this.  Okay.  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, Stanhope, what were you saying?  He was making a point.  I lost it.  What was it?  Oh, no, it was about, well, they come here and protest.  Should we kill them like they would in their own country?  What's your point?  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  In their own country, they wouldn't be able to do it.  Kind of makes sense.  What's the point?  I like it.  I think what he's saying is the fact that protesting means that they should at least appreciate  the fact they have the right to.  Well, I mean, that's how our country works.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You should be.  If you have a point of view, you respect our culture. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, but me and my partner can't even get married.  We don't have a culture at all.  Are you kidding?  You can't even put a Christmas tree in the lobby of a building anymore.  That's right.  That's right.  All right, Joey, what do you got?  But it's okay in jail for a guy to get raped.  Yeah.  That's right.  You know what I'm saying?  That's legal.  Take the good with the bad.  All right, if you want to migrate to Mexico.  All right, because we've got a break.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  One, if you migrate to Mexico, you must speak the native language.  Okay, you must be a professional or an investor.  No unskilled workers are allowed.  But why not?  There will be no special bilingual programs in the schools, no special ballots for election. 
[01:52:30]  All government business will be conducted in Spanish.  Foreigners will not have the right to vote regardless of time lived in Mexico.  Foreigners will never be allowed to hold public office.  And their country sucks.  What's your point?  Well, you say, well, this is the way they work, and it sucks.  It sounds like a party.  You should adopt rules that suck?  No, no, no.  We're trying to tell them how much. 
[01:53:00]  I know what you're doing.  We're asking them to speak English.  I know you're pointing out.  Okay.  You'll not be a burden to the taxpayer.  No welfare, no food stamps, no health care, no other government.  That's why people aren't going there.  We need to adopt that rule.  Yeah, no welfare.  They're broken, corrupt.  Without the protests, no demonstrations, no waving a foreign flag, no political organizing, no negative comments about the Mexican president or his policy.  To do so is cause for the immediate deportation to your country of origin.  And foreigners come to Mexico illegally will be turned down and sent to jail. 
[01:53:30]  Now, you over here, we're trying to teach you to speak English.  Give me a break.  Well, that's just like the Statue of Liberty.  Give us your downtrodden, your wretched, you know, we need to change that.  Give us your hard work.  I think Lou Reed had a good lyric about that, that you probably can't play anymore in this free country.  What's that?  The Lou Reed song?  Give us your tired, your poor, we'll...  Yeah.  Oh, right, yes.  Blank on them.  We'll dirty word on them.  Yeah.  Not even dirty word.  Lou Reed, you don't even know when the song is over.  He just babbles in the same... 
[01:54:00]  I can't stand him.  Man, the color girl said, yeah, did she...  Did she say boop-dee-doop-dee-doop-doop?  Well, that's the guy I want to hear social statements from.  Let's thank Joey for stopping by.  All right, Joey.  Thank you for the cheese steak.  Thank you for having me.  A big plug.  Gino's Steakhouse, where is that now again?  Nice and passion.  Huh?  There you go.  Nice and passion.  Just in case, you never know.  Nice and passion.  That's really good.  Joey Vento, everyone.  Thank you.  The disc tech de fromage.  Thank you.  Just a reminder, we're doing another hour of radio on commercial radio. 
[01:54:30]  Of course.  We're going an extra half hour.  Thanks to General Motors.  They have extended the Opie and Anthony show these past two days.  That's right.  General Motors introduces 100,000 miles of coverage and a new level of confidence.  Learn more.  Just go to GM.com.  All right.  We're going to go back outside and see what these freaks are going to do for O&A Traveling  Virus tickets.  Yeah.  Let's not bring that up.  I want to eat this sandwich.  Just don't mention it.  And possibly sit on the stage on the couch as everyone's performing.  Ten comedians tomorrow.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is on OpieandAnthony.com. 
[01:55:00]  We'll continue in just a bit.  We're broadcasting live from WYSP in Philly.  Opie and Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you ready?  Are you ready? 
[01:55:30]  Definitely having a good time today.  Jimmy Schubert in studio.  Doug Stanhope.  I think Dom's calling in a little while.  Tracy Morgan wants to call in.  And Gino is now, what's his name?  Joey.  Joey Vento.  Joey, who I like, but wants to meet with President Bush.  I told him if he's going to write him a letter, make sure you write it in crayons so he can  read it.  He's the real deal, though, man.  He is.  I just don't see him meeting with President Bush.  Vento. 
[01:56:00]  Vento is an Italian.  I love when conservative guys like that also hate George Bush.  That's refreshing.  At least there's some of the conservatives, yeah.  Bush is hard to defend lately.  I mean, I always kind of support him just because the liberals hate him, but you can't  really defend him lately.  He's just a goose.  Silly goose.  Yeah, I don't want to get too political about language like that.  That was terrific, actually.  Big A is going to do some news in a little while.  He should do it in studio so you guys can really appreciate what Big A is all about. 
[01:56:30]  Watch his finger twitch.  Yeah, he's a creep.  What are you going to do?  He's a creep.  What are you going to do?  He's got him on a widescreen TV where he can hear you.  That guy's a creep.  Oh, yeah.  He smiles.  He's awful.  Look at that shirt.  That shirt would give Peter Max a headache.  Look at that.  Awful.  Yeah, we'll do that hopefully soon.  A tiger should be jumping out at Chef through that shirt.  What's his name?  What's his name?  Big A.  Big A.  Don't ever try to go to Ventos. 
[01:57:00]  Genos.  Oh, Genos.  Genos, yeah.  Sorry.  Joey Vento from Genos.  Genos.  Anthony, we got the cockroach.  Can I have a...  Can I have a cheese?  Get out.  You don't speak anything.  Well, he has a problem with his S-T words.  So he'd get cheese out.  I'd like a cheese.  Cheese.  Cheese.  I guess give the guy a piece.  Get out of here. 
[01:57:30]  Strangle him at the counter like Luca Brasi with that neck.  Just pat his fat, lonely hand and then hold it.  Stick a knife in it.  Choke him with some piano wire.  Big oaf.  Look at him.  Oh, there's a smothered baby in his future.  Oh, yeah.  And by accident, though.  Not on purpose.  He's just going to roll over on it.  Hug it real tight.  And the baby will be 17.  He'll just be watching it and roll over on it.  Well, I buried the little feller.  Get him.  Oh, oh, good news. 
[01:58:00]  The news is ready for Big A, so get him up here.  He's just a boy.  He shouldn't see that.  In the meantime, man, we got the cockroach story,  and I guess it does make for some good audio.  Yeah.  I didn't see this yet.  I saw this last night, and I was like, video is hysterical.  I didn't know if the audio would play,  but I guess if you give it a little setup.  This is a weather guy.  This black gentleman's doing the weather,  and they don't really capture it on this audio,  the beginning of it.  He's just doing a weather forecast like any other weather guy, 
[01:58:30]  and he seems a little effeminate during the forecast,  but he's got it under control.  Yeah.  A cockroach apparently runs up this guy's shoe.  Up his shoe?  Yeah, and he loses his mind and becomes the most flaming gay guy ever.  And he's petrified of this cockroach,  I guess because the word roach is behind it.  Yeah, spoiling the whole thing. 
[01:59:00]  So, yeah, he just loses his mind.  And then it happens again later in the forecast.  Yeah.  So they go away, try to fix everything.  He comes back, and it happens again.  Another roach?  And he loses his mind even worse.  What are the odds that it would happen twice, though?  Come on.  It did.  This guy loses it.  Where's he broadcasting from?  In the studio?  Yeah, they're inside a news studio.  All right, let's take a listen to the audio.  We'll be pushing across central Florida,  so places like Orlando, Daytona Beach,  the Cape Canaveral area, Vero Beach, 
[01:59:30]  we'll be getting in on the heavier rainfall,  and eventually I should continue.  I am so sorry, Bill.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.  What the hell just happened?  Oh, my God.  This is what just happened.  That thing was crawling on my leg.  Wow.  Apparently there's a gay front moving in.  Gay front. 
[02:00:00]  Jesus.  Wow, it's going to be cloudy with a chance of early death.  Well, it's going to be breezy with a chance of shattered dreams.  All right, we've got another clip.  So it happened again?  Yeah, he came out to do it again.  All right.  There's a forecast, and, yeah, it happened again.  All right.  Oh, God.  If that...  Oh, my God!  That is a... 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, no!  Oh, my God.  This guy...  Right at the wall for me!  Wow.  And they actually have audio of the roast going,  It's a faggot!  Get me out of here!  Hey, that's all right.  Is the video pretty good, too?  Yeah, the video's pretty good.  He's just, like, hopping around, and he's got his hand over his mouth, and he's just losing  his mind.  Wow, the guy came out of the closet like a Murphy bed right in the middle of a motherfuckers. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  We got Big A?  Oh, that's on YouTube.  Just throw weatherman cockroach into the search engine.  Yeah, you'll see him.  All right.  We got Big A?  Coming up.  He's coming up as we speak?  Okay.  And then there is the other story we wanted to get to from Wisconsin.  We'll definitely get to that. 
[02:01:30]  Fun little love story.  By the way, if you're listening to us on YSP, we're at Fifth and Market, and we're going  to be here until about 1130, because we've got to do our XM show right after this ends.  Yeah.  And we have lots of things to give away.  Did you guys see that story with the video from the guy at the Seattle, Washington involving  the horse?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, fantastic.  Those were my hands.  Yeah, because I actually downloaded that, and then I downloaded the video for Brokeback  Mountain, and I edited them both together. 
[02:02:00]  You're another one of these nuts on the computer that loves editing video.  I love editing.  I do it all the time.  That's a commercial for your G5.  Yeah.  To edit the horse video with the Brokeback Mountain trailer.  There's so much funny video out there now.  Yeah, you could just pluck it off the web, grab it from DVDs, and throw together your  own stuff, and you put it out there in your own little, like, Spielberg presentation.  Yeah, right on YouTube.  It says Brokeback Mountain.  Do me a favor.  The bell?  Yes.  Please? 
[02:02:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Good job.  Okay.  That was a Jane Goodall joke.  Oh.  Open the door.  We've got to do this before we take a break and go commercial-free, courtesy of GM.  Big A, come on in, bro.  Meet the guys.  All right.  There you go.  Big A is in the house.  Hey, how are you, man?  How are you doing?  Get one of those mics set up in the corner for him.  Sure.  Over there.  Jesus Christ.  This is a treat for Jimmy Schubert and Doug Stanhope.  You've never seen anything like this before.  I've never seen a man with a gullet before.  He does.  He does news for us.  Throw him a fish. 
[02:03:00]  He does news for us.  Toad pouch under his chin.  Oh, my God.  Toad pouch.  Toad pouch.  Right.  Right.  You are dressed like a camouflaged German 88 in World War II.  Well, look at the size of that.  A muumuu.  Yeah, it is a muumuu.  Is it?  Wow.  Is it?  Is it?  Oh.  He's playing back.  So Big A does the news for us, but it takes him forever to get through the story, so he 
[02:03:30]  only does like three.  Okay.  Like, he does the three top stories, basically.  So, how are you, Big A?  Not bad.  I'm over it.  Would you fly over the water and grab some fish, you pelican?  Fly, Big A!  Is that mic on?  Talk again.  Oh.  It takes so long for him to talk.  I don't know.  I don't think it's on.  I don't think that mic's on. 
[02:04:00]  Try that.  Hit that other one.  Yeah, go to that one.  That one's on.  Go, go, go, go, go over there.  He's coming towards me.  Fantastic.  All right, here we go.  Okay, Big A.  There you go, Big A.  Now, also, everyone in the studio, get the visual when he's talking.  The fingers start, like, doing this.  He taps his leg.  He really has a...  That's like Joey Coco Diaz when he's doing blow.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's so funny.  He's tapping out code. 
[02:04:30]  All right, Big A.  An development would help.  Sorry.  It's sort of like Grandma's closet.  What?  Oh, no, no.  That's okay.  Go ahead.  Maybe some orbit.  Go later.  Do the story first.  No.  No.  He can't chew gum and read it at the same time.  Look, he can take a few chews and spit it out.  No, he's all right.  Let him do that.  Come on, bro.  Look, this is a studio that I am not usually in.  I don't usually have the guests this close to me.  It's like a buzzer of a turd wagon.  I'm right here.  I'm picking it up, bro. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, see?  Right?  It's a little gamey.  A little gamey from right here.  Don't make it look.  You've got to do the news, this boy.  Jimmy, why don't you look him in the eye and say that?  No, no.  It's like one part of Master Blaster, you know what I'm saying?  I don't know what I get.  All right.  All right, here we go.  He's in the house.  You spit that out.  Embargo.  In the thing there.  Keith, put your hand up.  No.  No, put your hand down, Keith.  Don't want everything.  There you go.  Spit it into that. 
[02:05:30]  We've got to do a spin.  There you go.  All right.  Here we go.  Now we're ready to just put it in his pocket.  I'm just mad as hell.  All right, Big A, you ready with the news?  All right, now.  I'm just mad as hell.  Big A with the news.  Big A has a little speech impediment problem with them.  And it's not really a stutter as much as he just has problems with ST words.  It is a stutter combined with that.  It's like a stammer.  Yeah, it's not a stutter, though.  A stutter is more of a, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  This is sort of a, he makes sounds that have nothing to do with the words that he's trying  to say.  It's aquatic.  It's almost like a sea mammal of some sort.  Like some type of whale noises.  Yes.  All right, let's go, Big A.  And you'll notice there's a lot of ST words in the script.  He's a good boy.  Because we're that good.  We're that damn good with this thing.  Banging his head on the ceiling.  Jesus.  All right.  Go ahead.  Oof.  Um, um, um, um, um, Big A. 
[02:06:30]  And by what's hammering the news.  A news.  Are these hates that most Canadians leave?  Be nice.  Hates.  Is that his fault?  You're cheating.  You're cheating.  You're cheating.  It sounds like he's starting to cry all the time.  Yeah.  It's about to burst into tears. 
[02:07:00]  Take that hat off for one second.  Oh, who cares?  Hat head.  Big deal.  You're cheating, by the way.  Oh, my God.  You're so...  Holy sweaty mess.  I'm sweating.  Uh, Big A, you're cheating again.  You're doing...  You're saying, like, resonance of this...  Looks like a wet mop on his head.  And then you go...  What's going on out there?  You cut out...  And then you go...  Eight.  Wait, I have a question.  I'm sorry to interrupt, Jan.  I save a free traveling virus ticket to anybody that licks the inside of that hat.  Oof.  Wow.  Wow.  What do you have?  What about if a girl French kisses Big A? 
[02:07:30]  We'll give her a pair of tickets.  That's it.  Big A, you want some action today?  Or a guy.  Hey, uh...  Any women out there...  Any women out there want to tongue kiss Big A?  You don't have to do anything sexual.  Yeah, no filter, Paul.  Look around.  Help us out.  Tongue kissing isn't sexual, did you?  Nah, that's not.  It's just something you do with a...  Does it with grandma.  Yeah, exactly.  Any...  That's called payment for babysitting.  Any women out there want to French kiss Big A?  Why is it going to be a chick?  Oh, we got one?  We got one, Paul?  They're punting at Paul.  Why is it going to be a chick? 
[02:08:00]  Who do we got?  Oh, boy.  Do we actually have someone that will kiss Big A for...  What is the captain from the captain and Tennille doing out there?  Oh, he is just awful.  I don't know.  Look at that, bro.  We got a girl?  We got a girl?  Did we?  Where?  Where?  Where?  That way.  This way.  Yeah, you got to move the camera to the...  You know, how about instead of the guys pointing, we actually see a girl?  Yeah, bring her up.  All right, we'll bring her up.  How about this?  We'll take a break.  We got a girl that's going to kiss Big A.  Who's got the remote?  They're taking still pictures. 
[02:08:30]  And he'll do the news first, and we're going to get him some action.  Yeah.  Because he's a good soldier.  Yeah, we got to take our last break, and then we're going commercial-free.  Thanks to GM, we're going to continue the show on commercial radio.  Here's the deal.  When we get back, Big A does the news, and he also gets kissed by a girl, and the girl  will win tickets to the O&A traveling virus at the Tweeter Center tomorrow night, featuring  ten comedians from this fine radio show.  All right, so stay right there.  And now, Reflections on James Norton, with Mr. Robert Stack.  I'd sure like to be his girlfriend, walking in the park hand in hand, wrapping my legs 
[02:09:00]  around, cuddling in the spool position.  All right!  Oh, little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the fluking and krabler!  On the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show today, the O&A virus.  We're live in Philly today, having a real good time.  What's that, the outside mic?  Okay.  Yeah, a little outside ambient sound going on. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you to GM.  GM, we get to work even more today, an extra half hour of radio for the people listening  to us on commercial radio, and then we're going to do the walk.  We're going to go outside WISP, Fifth and Market here in Philly, at about 9.30, pull around  with the crowd for a while, then we're coming back inside, and we'll continue on XM exclusively.  Yes.  They'll be able to hear us outside on XM, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They'll keep the audio on?  Yeah, that's a good idea, actually.  You have to, sure. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, we'll definitely do that.  So we're going to be hanging around WISP until about 11.30, if you want to stop on by  and say hi.  We got Jimmy Schubert in studio.  We're doing the O&A Traveling Virus tomorrow night at the Tweeter Center.  Tickets still available.  I think a lot of people are going to do the old walk-up tomorrow and get some tickets.  It's going to be a great day in Philly, weather-wise, so it's going to be perfect for comedy.  And they're tailgating and doing all sorts of stuff, too.  Yeah, the Tweeter Center is a great venue.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a great venue to see a show, so yeah.  I haven't been there since Ozzfest.  Really?  We broadcasted backstage at Ozzfest. 
[02:10:30]  We had a great, great time, so.  Where's Big A?  We're bringing Big A back in.  We got them out.  Did the girl back out after smelling Big A's breath?  No.  All right.  Oh.  I mean.  You're mean.  He is going to smother someone eventually.  Hey, Big A.  You open.  We're going to get you some action.  Is that all right?  All right.  Where's the girl?  That'll be the showstopper, I guess.  Club Soda Canning, what's up?  You want to save it for outside in front of a crowd during the walk?  No.  I say we do it here.  Yeah, we got to do it here. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  You got to do it here?  All right.  I'll bring her up.  And if there's a love connection, then they can continue outside.  All right.  There's another guy that wants to lick Big A's armpits.  For a pair of tickets?  Yeah.  Bring him up.  Oh, bro.  Bring him up.  No.  He's got to lick the armpits while he's kissing the girl, bro.  Big A's not laughing.  Big A.  What's wrong?  Not a smile on your face.  Come on.  They laughed a little too hard in front of you, didn't they?  No.  Dude, I'm laughing.  The funny thing is that Kenny just said that.  Kenny just said there's a guy who wants to lick Big A's armpits. 
[02:11:30]  How do you not laugh at that statement?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The situation.  We're not laughing at you.  We're laughing at the situation.  If he said he wanted to lick Steve's armpits, I would have laughed just as hard and then  filled up a little.  Big A, remember who your biggest fan is in the room.  Remember who your biggest fan is in the room.  That's right.  If you're going to smother anyone, then you smother him, okay?  That's right.  All right.  Plus, he's getting action.  You're getting action.  He's getting action.  Come on.  I see Andrew socially.  I bump into him at the comedy clubs.  Yeah.  All right.  He's my...  They're back.  What is...  It's our turn. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, it's an Eagles fan.  Oh, there you go.  It's an Eagles fan.  Somebody should put him to sleep.  There's an Eagles fan outside.  Looks like Mel Carter.  This guy's losing his mind outside.  Hey, you're live on the radio.  You're live on the radio.  Who is this guy?  You know, my team's in the building.  No way.  You look bad.  You see me?  Yeah.  I don't know, but he forgot an L in the second word on his shirt.  Let's put it this way.  He is not getting served at Gino's neck.  No.  No, wait.  Now it sucks. 
[02:12:30]  T.O. Swallows.  Yeah.  He's not making any sense.  Talk to the little blonde Naomi Watts on his shoulder.  Yeah, I thought Patrice couldn't make it down from the broadcast.  All right.  He's just babbling.  You know, Ben Laden and us got something in common.  Yeah.  Bob Houston's is going down.  Rock and roll McDonough's.  Rock and roll McDonough's. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Well, great.  And we're going out to that mess in about 15, well, about 20 minutes or so.  Tell the nutty professor to wait.  What does the back say?  I don't know.  Yeah, he's got a picture of the Super Bowl.  All right.  We're going, baby.  Super Bowl champions.  And that's easy for you to slur.  I hate people with sports pride.  My team, my team.  God, shut up.  All right.  Let's get a couple new stories for Big A. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Big A, we're back to you, bro.  Okay.  All right.  We've got to do this new thing.  We've got to do it quickly, though.  We're running out of time.  Quickly, Pyle.  Remember, three stories.  This will take about 10 minutes.  So, sit down and relax.  Go ahead, Steve Potato.  All right.  Go ahead, Big A.  Start all over.  And don't cheat, because, Anthony, I caught you cheating.  Yes.  S, T, and then keep going.  Right.  Or we slap your hands. 
[02:14:00]  He started.  I'm, Big A.  And by...  For the Samaritan News.  There's a new...  A new study that most Canadians believe the Unites. 
[02:14:30]  The Unites.  Go with principalities.  Doug, stand on.  Come on.  Finally funny at 910.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Oh, you've been funny all morning, bro.  Okay.  Well, I believe the United, why?  Yeah.  The United States.  All right.  Is that fault for the strikes? 
[02:15:00]  The terrorists unleashed on 9-11.  The U.S.  The U.S.  The U.S.  The U.S.  The U.S.  And then, Paul, is strumming up a...  He nailed that one.  ...agguring amount of media attention and is singing many residents of the States. 
[02:15:30]  77%  of  Oh boy. Yeah, no one can read that.  Oh boy, good luck. We can do it.  A.O.P.H., can you help me?  No, just  You can do it.  You can do it. Just sound it out.  77% of  Of  Of Q  Because? Yeah, that's close.  QB Co's  Good records.  QB Co's 
[02:16:00]  You didn't even sound that out right.  Try it again. It's not QB Co's.  It's Cous Cous.  I don't know either.  What is it? Quebec.  Quebec Guam?  It has something to do with people that live in Quebec.  Yeah. Oh my god, he's only up to there.  I just  looked at the paper.  This is what GM gets.  Did you pass these out to everyone outside?  We all have cheat sheets, so we know what he's trying to say. 
[02:16:30]  Right, right.  You should pass this out to the listeners out front.  Go ahead, Sweetie Pie. You can do it.  GM paid for this crap.  I'd love to run him over with a GM vehicle.  Yeah.  He is a GM vehicle.  All right.  It's huge.  SUV.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Backies.  It's close enough.  We'll give it to you.  It's better than QB Coys.  Coming from the QB Coys tribe.  What is a string of QB Coys?  All the Polo Ponies. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Hey, speak French or get out of the country.  Constituents say that the states were at least somewhat at fault.  very, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, strong statement. 
[02:17:30]  Unfortunately, this is making many in the states, uh, uh, uh, uh, think.  Now, can anyone tell us how this sentence started?  Not at all.  All right.  I have no idea what that story was about.  No.  Yeah, well, we have, uh, three stories. 
[02:18:00]  One down, two to go.  A little entertainment news.  Yeah, a little entertainment news.  It's the big story of the day.  Yeah, Paris Hilton.  She actually blew over the legal limit, and then she went to the bar.  Wait a minute.  I don't like that type of talk.  It's libelous.  Yeah, he started the second story, by the way.  In case you're wondering.  Dark?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Darling, all that Paris Hilton was stopped by the, uh, uh, uh, LAPD. 
[02:18:30]  Early Thursday morning forward, reportedly steering her car under the fluence of alcohol.  They rode steering her car. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Of course they could have.  Under the fluence of alcohol.  Hilton's latest rated.  that this stunt only took place  because she was starving.  After not having eaten any sustenance all day. 
[02:19:30]  What? Eating any what?  Sustenance, that means ear pus.  Hilton ardently went behind the wheel  in an attempt to get a steaming hot hamburger. 
[02:20:00]  This could actually be a strategic plan  to string along the media  and boost strikingly low album sales.  We'll keep you posted. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, thank you.  One more.  One more.  One more story.  Forging ahead.  She has an album?  Yeah, she has an album.  Oh, she's good, man.  Shut up.  Acting lessons, dancing lessons.  Put her in a video with Ardoon.  Big A doesn't get a part in that picture.  You're going to act like a stammering idiot.  It'd be perfect for him. 
[02:21:00]  Go ahead, Big A.  My voice.  Hey, what's going on in sports, Big A?  Hey, there you go.  In the stupendous world of sports,  NFL season's party last night  with the Pittsburgh Steelers  against the Mammy Dolphins.  The Mammy Dolphins? 
[02:21:30]  The Mammy.  Ah, Mammy.  Mammy.  Want a touchdown, want a touchdown,  my dear old Mammy.  All playing in blackface?  Um, um, um, um,  Mammy Dolphins.  Right.  Is that better, Jim?  Attaboy.  Oh!  Hey, Jimmy!  Yes, I am.  I like Mammy Dolphins myself.  All right.  What else happened in that game? 
[02:22:00]  The Steelers.  Uh-oh.  The Steelers.  Schoolworks first.  And stayed on top  in the end  to win 28-17.  The Steelers had to play  without  hand-out quarterback.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Buckle in.  Oh, boy.  Pittsburgh's listening to you. 
[02:22:30]  You better get it right.  They're listening right now on K-Rock.  You better get this right.  Ben.  Ben.  Something German.  Ben Boethlisberger.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Got to give it to him.  Got to give it to him.  Sure, why not?  All right.  When he hopped suddenly, while riding his motorcycle over the summer, he struck the windshield. 
[02:23:00]  He struck him like a screaming baby.  Windshield of a station wagon, and wasn't wearing a helmet, which is stupid.  A little editorializing.  I didn't know Big A could editorialize. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  I'm Big A.  And that's the news.  Now,  up,  staring at me,  and  on your day.  There we go.  What do you think, Doug?  I can breathe.  I think someone's tongue should be in his mouth.  That's what I think.  All right.  Wow.  And we're going to do that now.  All right.  So what's going on?  Who's in charge of what's going to happen next?  We've got two guys that want O&A Traveling Virus tickets.  We've got a guy that's going to lick your armpits. 
[02:24:00]  Is that all right, Big A?  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Ready for him?  All right.  Hold on.  Are we doing the make-out first or at last?  Which one will be more impressive?  The make-out, I think, will be more impressive.  Yeah.  You want to close on that.  You want to close strong, right?  Yeah.  You want to leave him with wood.  I don't know a guy licking the armpits.  While he's getting kissed.  No, you've got to do one at a time, because I only have one hand.  What's up?  Wow.  How are you, man?  Hey, what's your name, bro?  Mike Hunt.  Mike?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:24:30]  Your name is Mike.  Hunt.  And your last name is Hunt.  Correct.  No way.  Let me see your license, please.  There's actually one that's alive.  I've got to see your license.  Wow.  Get out.  Wow.  Porky's one.  That is the biggest, like...  Man, your parents were jokesters, huh?  Yeah, everyone.  Wow.  Wow.  Are you kidding?  No, it's somewhere in here.  Did you keep in touch with Janet Leigh?  Look at you shake.  Wow, are you a nervous little Nelly. 
[02:25:00]  Don't be nervous.  You don't have your license?  I shake like that, too, but it's alcoholism.  We finally have a guy named Mike...  Pause, pause, pause.  Hunt.  And you don't have a license to prove it?  Wait, here it is.  Kind of...  Here it is, here it is, here it is.  Let me see.  This guy...  That's his name, really?  Michael?  Michael J. Hunt.  Your name...  And that's funny, because right over it, it says organ donor.  They'll be looking all day for that one. 
[02:25:30]  He's donating it, but I can't find one.  We need a pair of lips.  Got him.  Wow.  Here I am.  Did you ever ask your parents why?  Yeah, no answer.  No answer?  You ever have to give your name to be paged?  I didn't know that by cops.  Huh?  I've actually been stopped for cops for, like, smoking and joining on the corner,  and then they tell me I'm lying to them.  Because they ask you your name, and then they tell me.  You go, hey, smartass, what are you, a comedian?  Exactly. 
[02:26:00]  So they start tooling you up, and you finally have to show them that that's your real name?  Yeah, you're a real brazen son of a bitch, that type of thing.  Tuning you up, tooling.  What happens when...  I stink.  What happens when you give your name somewhere, and they have to announce you?  Do they...  You ever been...  They're real, real...  They make sure they pronounce you it.  Yeah, they say Mike...  Michael Hunt.  Michael Hunt.  All right.  So you're ready to lick Big A's armpits for O&A Traveling Virus tickets?  Yeah, I guess, uh...  Big A?  Oh, boy.  We're going to be harmless.  Did you throw any deodorant in there today? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  That mic doesn't work.  Did you ever lick a chick's armpit when she had antiperspirant?  Yeah, it's disgusting.  I like it raw, dude.  I like it raw smell.  It dries out your tongue.  Big A.  By the way, Big A's real name is Haywood.  You know his last name?  Big A, you guys share that mic.  Get that mic out of the game.  It's not working.  Yeah, that mic's no good.  Can he move it immediately?  All right, Big A, you're going to have to take your shirt off.  It's all right.  Oh, boy.  Don't be shy.  We all got...  Oh, my God.  His chest hair is as sweaty as the hair on his head. 
[02:27:00]  No wonder he's sweating.  He had a sweater under the shirt.  There it is.  Nice sweater, bro.  You are actually...  Oh, my God.  You got a big gut, but the rest of them is better than I thought it would be.  What?  I'm telling you.  It's kind of hot.  He's got a sweater bra on.  Yeah.  He looks like he should be clawing a tent apart looking to eat the person inside.  I do not appreciate that, dude.  All right.  Big A, lift up your arm.  Oh, boy.  We got to see you.  Oh.  Come over there so we can all see you.  I can't.  There's a mole, a skin tag... 
[02:27:30]  Let's see it.  ...and some discoloration.  We can't see it, sweetie pie.  Move over here.  Turn that way.  Turn it to everybody.  That's fine.  It's the pit.  Jesus.  Shut up.  Do a little turn on the catwalk.  Wow.  All right.  Mike, you're willing to lick that?  You got to make it look good or you don't get the tickets.  All right.  It's harmless.  They're going to hurt you, dude.  Here we go.  He's licking.  No.  It's got to be a real lick.  Come on.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got to impress these people outside.  Kenny was in the way.  They saw a mullet. 
[02:28:00]  Wait.  Can they see this on camera?  Oh, God.  He's doing it.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm at the chest here right there.  That's not that bad.  Yeah.  Right across the...  Right between the boobs.  Look at his nipples.  Just look at his nipples.  Come on.  Right between the boobs for the ONA traveling virus ticket.  It was backstage.  Bansies.  Yeah.  What do you guys think?  What do you guys think?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, now you're gay.  That was...  You didn't say no homo.  How was it?  Wait. 
[02:28:30]  Get on mic.  Horrible.  Wow.  Now your breath smells like your name.  Are you going to throw up?  We can throw a couple of tongue darts in this crusty dung bunker.  For backstage.  For backstage.  Horrendous.  What did it taste?  What did it taste like?  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  You got to describe it for us.  I mean...  Think.  Terrible.  No words to describe that horrible, horrible flavor. 
[02:29:00]  I wouldn't be qualified as a flavor, really.  I think we should have made...  See, the next person...  Flavor has to be something you could really...  Yeah.  Like a little tangible.  The next person has to just bury their face in the pit.  I think that's fair.  Anyone's pits are awful.  Oh, we have more tickets to give away?  Yeah.  All right.  Get someone up here to do that.  Yeah.  Well, let's get the girl in now.  Yeah, she's lovely.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just a kiss.  How did that feel, Big A?  Why is this all about the pitcher and not the catcher?  Absolutely.  Good point, Doug.  Good point.  Did it tickle, Big A? 
[02:29:30]  Awful.  It felt awful?  It felt awful?  Yeah.  And I want to ask the lead now.  You're going to kiss Big A.  Is Danny DeVito going to get jealous?  Oh, I don't know.  Now, what's your name?  Tammy.  Tammy.  I got you.  Yeah.  And very nice.  How old a gal are you?  A 37.  37.  Cool.  And you're going to French kiss Big A.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:30:00]  Mm-hmm.  And leave the shirt over, Big A.  Leave the shirt over, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to get a kiss from a beautiful girl.  Maybe she'll run her fingers through your hair on your chest there.  Wet dog hair.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  We're going to snap on here, Dickie.  Nice.  All right, well.  Wait a minute.  What?  Do you guys know each other?  Yeah.  All right.  Briefly.  Tell the fucking story.  Hey, hey.  All right.  Hold on.  Why are they cursing out there?  Listen, a potty mouth out there.  I hope they dumped out there.  Hey, listen, guys. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Guys.  Kill him.  What do you mean, tell the effing story?  What's that about?  Oh, Steve.  He's going on his notepad.  What?  Wait, wait.  It's Steve.  It's on the notepad.  It's on the notepad?  All right.  It's on the notepad?  Stupid Limey is trying to say something.  Yeah, just tell us.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah, for once, open your mouth with something constructive.  Yeah.  Awful hairdo.  It's working?  Yes, it's working.  Okay.  Tammy has been leading Big A on for about four months and banging every other guy off of 
[02:31:00]  Power Talk except him.  So poor Big A is heartbroken.  She broke his heart.  Now she's finally going to make out.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  I have to do a boyfriend and girlfriend.  You shrunken Limey man cow.  Okay, that makes sense.  Here's why.  Because we weren't sure if you guys were dating, in which case that wouldn't have been cool.  But no, the fact that he likes you, that's good for you.  We're happy this is working out.  And are you banging all the guys on Power Talk?  No.  She says no filter, Paul. 
[02:31:30]  How many?  Paul.  No filter, Paul.  Allegedly.  Yeah, no filter, Paul.  Allegedly.  Who has she banged?  Allegedly.  I don't know if I should name names.  How many?  Shut up and name them.  How many names?  Give us a number.  Give us a number.  Are they Jackers?  I'll forget.  Yeah, how many?  Hey, Paul, can you and your awful body...  At least four or five.  At least four or five.  At least four or five.  Is that number accurate?  No, that is not true.  Is it two or three?  How many?  No.  Is it one? 
[02:32:00]  Could be one.  Could be one.  Could be one.  One person on Power Talk.  At least five.  Is it in your prison pocket?  No, it's one.  Prison pocket.  That's this week, though, she's talking about.  Oh, just this week.  Oh, all right.  Hey, Paul, are any of them sitting there right now?  No, the guy is not here.  No, he's from New York.  So it's one this week?  Absolutely.  All right, this is boring.  Thanks, no filter, Paul, for shutting down the show once again.  Jesus.  Thanks for bringing us to a complete hall. 
[02:32:30]  Thank you.  He's doing pretty well up to this point.  All of a sudden, it became the BBC.  Just want to remind everyone that GM is paying for this crap.  All right, so we're going to do a little make-out here.  It's got to be a good one, though.  For Big Ed, we didn't know he liked you.  It's got to be a good one.  You ready, Big Ed?  You're nervous?  Make out like it's a guy that you actually care about and would want to kiss.  Andrew, you've got to turn your hat around, because what's going to happen is you're  going to add a boy.  You look better.  There you go.  It's more Millennium.  Wow.  Yeah.  Dig in.  Now, now, slow, sensuous.  Let it last a while. 
[02:33:00]  Don't go right into it.  Do it like you're a couple, maybe a little kissing at first, and then the mouth opens.  You know, like a scene.  Throw on a love song and make a scene.  What are you, Francis Ford Stroke?  Hey, Big Ed, you like her?  All right, now lose the pants, honey.  She has nice feet.  She really does.  You have nice feet.  I'm not a foot guy, but you have really nice feet.  Yeah, we found something.  Big Ed, come.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:33:30]  Come on, man.  That is just mean.  I didn't finish my sins.  Big Ed, you really like her, though?  I did like her, and I mean, her are just friends now.  All right.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Do you want to squeeze those things, though?  That's right.  Can he, you know.  Cop a feel while you're kissing?  Honka, honka, honka.  Come on, take advantage.  Say yes to the honka, honka.  Come on.  Yeah, you wonder how far she would have gone with this if you didn't just said it.  Would you, look, I'm going to just be, I'm going to be blunt. 
[02:34:00]  Go ahead.  Right here.  Would you lose your shirt, let him feel you up while you make out with him?  Hoo-hoo.  It's harmless.  A kiss.  Yeah, it's for backstage.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  You know Big Ed.  You look nice and high.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  It's fine.  I want to see these anyway.  It's harmless.  All right.  Oh, you don't have to be shy.  That's all right.  There you go.  Okay.  See, look at that. 
[02:34:30]  They're a very lovely set.  There you go.  They're lovely.  All right.  You let him feel you up.  Big A, look at them.  But will you have sex with him for $25?  Big A, look at them.  Look at them.  Look upon them.  Gaze upon them.  What would you do with those things?  Cut them off.  And make a trophy.  You said that.  Yeah.  I'd make a paperweight.  Big A, it's different.  Now, Kenny's actually put up a challenge.  Leaving your panties completely.  You wear panties? 
[02:35:00]  Leaving them completely alone.  You don't have to take those off or anything.  But would you take the pants off?  No.  Why are you ragging?  It's just like a big bathing suit bottom, right?  And it's just like a bikini bottom.  We have like.  Yeah.  So you can like lose the pants.  No?  The other stations will cut out when they want, I guess.  Okay.  Whatever.  All right.  So, so big A, look at, look at, look at her.  Yeah.  You like that?  Yes, I do.  When was the last time you had your hands on a woman where her clothing usually covers 
[02:35:30]  like that?  Never.  Where there wasn't screaming.  A couple of years ago?  A couple of years ago?  When's the last time you had both hands free?  When one was not holding a pistol.  Those are teardrops.  Those are nice.  Oh, wow.  I mean on your face.  Yeah, Steve, why don't you come back? 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  Do you have bad news?  No.  Well, I thought for the bearer of bad news.  I get it.  Grr.  Bearer.  Nothing.  Christ.  Ah, my sound isn't even on for me to crash.  Hey, Steve, are we staying on, right?  I suck.  All right.  It's on now, Baron.  Sorry about that.  Okay, I could crash myself.  All right, big A.  Awful wreckage.  You guys make this look good for tickets, okay?  All right, very sexy.  Do it up like you're in a relationship a little bit, and big A, it's not awkward. 
[02:36:30]  You're acting.  And if you start to get excited, go with it.  Right, go with it.  Don't hold back.  Tongue kiss.  And not this immediate, you know, right into it.  Kind of work as your shoulders.  Work your hand around until you reach, you know, what you want to reach.  And don't stop until you're a different in a gay sale at a Ricky Martin concert, all right?  Big A, try to get your tongue all the way in and then withdraw it so her front teeth scrape 
[02:37:00]  your tongue.  That's the way to do it, buddy.  Oh, my God.  Did you want any dairy products before we could start this?  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, come up, Barbell.  Come up.  It could be very romantic.  All right.  We're going to lose some stations.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Here we go.  And here we go.  Don't hold your breath.  What are you doing?  Here we go.  Very slow.  Everybody read that.  This is, this is, okay, I don't think you're getting the scene right.  This is, you just had a great date. 
[02:37:30]  You finally know it's time.  Okay?  You're upstairs.  It's your first real contact with each other.  You just came back from the war.  Awkwardly.  Right.  This is pre-restraining order now.  Exactly.  Turn sideways so they can see on the camera.  You got to turn sideways a little bit.  Yeah.  There it is.  We got to hurry up.  Tom's being a buzzkiller in New York.  He wants us to wrap up ASAP.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  No.  No.  Open your mouth.  Oh, my God.  Tom, what is that?  They're starting.  Okay.  Let them roll.  They're doing good. 
[02:38:00]  Not your grandmother, Andrew.  They're doing good.  Okay.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  She's cringing.  Why is she cringing so much?  She's cringing.  Come on.  He's reassuring you.  Oh, he's going right to it now.  Just after you've had an abortion.  Oh, look.  Wow.  She is wincing.  Wait.  That was not good.  That was not sexy at all.  That wasn't sexy.  There was no open mouth kissing.  Tongue.  Tongue.  There's no ticket.  Open your mouth.  Wide open.  Tongue.  Grab those, Big A, with those big mitts.  Open your mouth.  Start juggling.  Big A.  Oh, my God.  Big A.  Jeez.  Oh, my God. 
[02:38:30]  He's pecking her.  Big A, you're pecking her.  Head and mouth.  You're pecking her.  Why are you open mouthing it?  Why aren't you open mouth like this?  This is how you're kissing, girl.  You're leading your head in like this with your mouth open.  And you'll whore.  Yeah.  Throw your tongue down her gooey shoes.  And your mouth's kind of interlocked sideways and your tongue swish around.  It's a movie kiss.  Come on.  Just go.  Do it up.  Do it up.  Open mouth, Andrew, or I'll slap you.  Andrew, open that mouth.  Open up that damn mouth in yours.  Stick that tongue in there.  That's right.  Stick that retarded tongue in yours in her mouth now.  She is clenching her teeth shut so hard. 
[02:39:00]  Wait, wait, what?  Andrew, what?  What's wrong, man?  Andrew's trying.  It's like trying to get through a prison gate.  His tongue is smashing against her teeth.  She is wincing.  No, she's scared because she's friends with him.  She doesn't want to wreck the friendship.  Open your mouth, Andrew.  The friendship, he's not that fun to handle.  It'll be very quick.  Just let him trade a little tongue.  That's a kiss.  You have to accept his tongue into your mouth.  That's a kiss.  Here we go.  You know what, he's going to hurt his feelings?  Here it comes.  She says okay, right?  Yeah.  Let's do it. 
[02:39:30]  Poor big crimp smother.  Think happy thoughts.  Grab his package.  It'll take your mind off his breath.  All right.  Big A's in there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  His lips go like a bug.  All right.  They're like purse.  They get real tight.  That's the grand finale.  Oh, that is frightening.  He gets nervous.  Big A, you got very nervous.  Look at his rod.  Does he have a rod?  I don't know.  No, it's in his hand.  He wants to hit it with it.  All right.  We want to thank GM for letting us go an extra half hour, I guess. 
[02:40:00]  Thank you.  General Motors.  They sponsored this extra half hour of Opie and Anthony on commercial radio.  General Motors introduces 100,000 miles of coverage and a new level of confidence.  Learn more at GM.com.  I also want to thank Dish Network for today's football picks.  Give them a call at 1-888-GET-DISH.  We want to thank Jimmy Schubert, Doug Stanhope.  We want to thank Chapman Ford and CNC Ford in Horsham.  Morton Steakhouse.  We're cooking the fine breakfast we all ate today.  Thank you, Morton.  Good stuff.  I think we're having lunch with Morton's today as well. 
[02:40:30]  It just continues with steak.  Advanced AV.  The Philadelphia police were the escort this morning through an empty city.  That was terrific.  I got to tell you, we felt like rock stars.  Police escort.  With no one to get out of the way.  One homeless guy saw us looking like rock stars.  So thank you to the Philadelphia police.  First class limos was the limo that brought us over to WYSP.  And of course, everyone here at 94.1 WYSP.  Okay.  Yeah.  But now we're sticking around.  XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going outside to meet the freaks and the fans and the pest. 
[02:41:00]  And then we're going to continue on XM.  So we got lots to do still live from WYSP.  And the XM show will be broadcast on the streets of Philadelphia.  And they're at Fifth and Market.  Are we going to be able to use naughty language down there?  I don't know.  I don't know if WYSP is going to listen for a little while.  Are they going to listen for a little while?  They might listen for a little while.  And then we'll finally be on XM exclusively.  Okay.  All right.  Guys, thank you so much.  If you're not joining us on XM, have a great weekend.  Things I want to say.  Yeah, I'm backed up.  I'm all backed up. 
[02:41:30]  And we have to interview her, too, on XM.  I want to ask her about the kiss once we get on XM.  Yeah, we'll do that.  And, of course, plenty of tickets still available for the O&A Traveling Virus.  Jimmy Schubert is going to be one of ten comedians on that stage tomorrow at the Tweeter Center.  And we can't wait.  All right?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  This is not what I'm used to.  Here it is, live.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Zoo.  Nothing but vowel language and toilet humor.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson, uh-uh. 
[02:42:00]  Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy malarkey.  Tiny cooley.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good natured joshing around.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  Puppy cock.  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  Hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple. 
[02:42:30]  Oh!  But, boy, they sure did.  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Saturday, September 16th.  What happened to just riding around the country, you with a stick in your hand and a monkey  in the passenger seat?  Opie and Anthony present...  Her house burned down.  She's living in a car.  Yes.  And then what do I do?  You bring her home to fuck her.  Right.  You gotta slap her around and keep her lying just in case.  For one night only... 
[02:43:00]  She was mouthing.  The Laszlo Show.  I blacked out.  Is this a radio show still?  Saturday, September 16th from 9 till midnight Eastern on XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  All right.  There it is.  Did you hear me yet?  No, this is not working.  We're on.  All right.  I can't really hear myself.  I heard Jimmy for a second.  That's technical things.  I heard you, though, Jimmy.  Maybe the other mic.  Hold on. 
[02:43:30]  Is this working?  I hear you on that mic.  And you can hear me?  Yeah.  All right.  And I hear Jimmy a little bit.  We're just doing a little adjusting here in the lobby of YSP.  I hear you in that.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  We got you.  Maybe it's my headphones.  It's good.  Now turn up the volume on your headphones.  I just figured that out.  It's different.  Where's your...  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Jesus.  There you go.  We're in the lobby of YSP.  We're ready to go outside.  There's a few hundred people out there.  My headphones are fine.  This mic is low.  Yeah.  Now it's better. 
[02:44:00]  I think it's just through your headphones.  But through the radio, it'll sound fine.  Okay.  Let's hope so.  Yeah.  Mine sounds like that, too.  The people outside need to hear this.  Okay.  All right.  It's going to be really hard to hear, everybody.  Let's see.  All right.  I'm the Ben Franklin guy.  Oh.  I want to stand in.  Ben Franklin.  It's Ben Franklin.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Hello.  Hi. 
[02:44:30]  Hello, Mr. Franklin.  Yeah.  Nice.  What?  How are you, sir?  All right.  We got you.  Oh.  Perfect.  Perfect.  This is perfect.  Right here is going to be the best.  Is it?  Wow.  Yeah, there is.  That's fantastic.  I don't even know if these mics are working to be on today.  They are.  They are.  Franklin's here.  What do you do?  You walk around like Ben?  You walk around like Ben?  You're 300 years old.  What else can you do?  I walk around, have a good time, visit the people.  You know, when the best people come to Philadelphia, they come see me. 
[02:45:00]  Do they?  Right.  That's why you're here, isn't that?  Wait, does that work?  I don't know.  Unfortunately.  It does.  All right, good.  It does.  He is wearing his famous bifocals.  That's right.  Invented by Ben Franklin.  What other things did you invent, sir?  I invented the first musical instrument invented by an American, the glass harmonica.  See, all these guys out here, all these guys out here, play my musical instrument.  They don't all play this.  They all play the musical instrument I invented.  You know, you take a glass, you fill it with a little good liquid, dip your finger in, 
[02:45:30]  rub it around the edge of the glass, drive your friends nuts.  I invented that.  Did you?  Tell them, Robin.  I invented everything.  I invented the bifocals.  Very good, sir.  You get to invent everything.  All right, we got it.  You've been around 300 years.  Do you just kind of lead, like, tours of scenic Philadelphia and historians?  No, there aren't any tours.  I don't know what's going on here.  All I know is where I live.  Where do you live?  Franklin Court, not far from here.  Do you?  They tore down my house. 
[02:46:00]  Did they?  Don't leave anything.  Spend it while you're here.  Should we?  Spend it on yourselves.  Should we?  Right, because they take it once you're gone.  It's gone.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, you look great for your age, sir.  Does he?  I must say.  He's 38.  Hey, let's go have a parade.  That's one of the big things we do here in Philadelphia.  Do you?  Yeah, we parade.  We walk around the lot.  Cool.  We drink.  You do?  We parade, and we do that other thing you can't talk about.  What's that?  What's that?  Can't choose.  All right, let's hear it for Ben Franklin, everyone.  Let us continue down this way. 
[02:46:30]  Okay.  Hi.  We'll be back.  Wow, a lot of cameras out here.  Oh, yes, look at that.  Old cancer hair.  Hello, people.  Hi.  And, of course, Ben Franklin.  Hey, man.  Oh, look at this.  Who's the spokesperson?  Jesus.  He's on string band, Opie and Anthony.  Jackie Bam Bam.  Welcome to Filth Adolfia.  It's me, Noir.  Filth Adolfia.  Hi.  Wow. 
[02:47:00]  That's great.  Thank you.  Yes.  That's great.  That's wonderful.  I'm sure Anthony will be good.  I won't be dancing.  Anthony wants to dance.  No, dance it, Opie.  He looks like he's going to war in a bathhouse.  You got this?  You're going to walk down the street with us?  Yeah, we'll follow you.  All right, yeah.  You guys lead the way.  He got that in Liberace garage sale.  Look at that thing.  I've never wanted a drunk driver as bad as I do right now.  All right, go.  We'll follow you guys.  Come on.  Go ahead.  Let old tin mule lead the parade. 
[02:47:30]  Let's follow the cops.  All right, we'll follow the cops.  Yeah, let them go.  Let them go.  There they go.  Okay.  After you, gentlemen.  There it is.  Nice.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Oh, they got a lady here.  Three T-cells between them.  Wait, miss.  All right, now what?  Are we following these guys?  Go ahead, Opie.  See how far we get.  This is the silliest thing ever. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, this is ridiculous.  Not now.  Yeah, we'll take pictures in a little while.  We got to do this dumb...  Where are they going?  I don't know.  Make a right.  It's going to be funny if we just made a right and they kept going.  Should we just turn around and let them keep going?  All right, make a left.  Just let them...  Let them keep watching. 
[02:48:30]  See how far they go?  They went that way, we went this way.  This is so silly.  There's someone with no T-cells in the middle going, what do you want from me?  All right, we're outside WISP, Fifth Market.  Yeah, we'll sign and we'll take pictures in a little while.  We're still broadcasting, believe it or not.  I know it sounds like crap, but this is what we're doing today.  It does sound like crap.  We're going over to Betsy Ross' house, the original Monica Lewinsky.  Oh.  Yeah, that's where George Washington was helping her with the... 
[02:49:00]  Wait, where's Ben Franklin to lead us on this thing?  On how far we can get.  He already dropped out of a heart attack.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, we're only wireless, so they're going to lose us.  Oh, wow.  Okay, we got to stop right here.  Oh, there he is.  Why does Jimmy Schubert have the Howard Cosell headphones on?  I don't know if this is with the hat, bro.  I got the bottom of the barrel.  Oh, you lost you.  Oh, yeah, we're going to have to go back this way.  Make way, make way, make way.  Oh, look at Kenny.  We got to go through.  We got to go through.  Oh, a sign. 
[02:49:30]  All right, are we back on the radio?  I hope so.  Are we back on?  It sounds like it.  I know XM's got us, right?  Yeah.  All right, we're at least on XM Satellite Radio.  Outside WISP.  We're looking really silly as we just kind of walk back and forth on a sidewalk.  Yeah, like just tools.  Well, you know what it is.  We're only wireless.  We don't have, like, those big exotic broadcasting things where we can really go far.  Right.  Like we do in New York.  And we had, where else did we walk around?  Tell the band to play.  Make them play. 
[02:50:00]  Play something.  Play something.  All right, we're back to the silly band.  And the band's going to start up again.  Play a song called We Should All Be Killed.  And here they go, the band again, yes.  They would make the goofiest looking road pizza, wouldn't they, if a bus came by?  Oh, they're a chip.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Are we following them across the street?  That's actually what Eric hears in his head as he's whacking his bag to Hulk Hogan photos. 
[02:50:30]  All right, let's cross the street again.  Ah, here's Ben Franklin.  We thought we lost him.  Oh, God.  I'd love to see him just grab his chest and fall into that puddle.  Ben has more wisdom for everybody.  You're getting loose on the streets of Philadelphia.  Did you?  And in two seconds, you get lost.  No, you know what it was?  Our mics crapped down.  We can only go so far.  We can only go so far.  Yes.  You don't know about electronics and microphones, sir.  They didn't have that.  He discovered electricity.  I didn't go as far as I want. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, he did.  I didn't go as far as they let me.  I'd like to show you how far your electricity experiments have come by giving you a pair  of tweezers and have you stick them in a light socket.  We've got to get back.  I can find electricity that way, sir.  Oh.  We have to go back?  Yeah.  We're cutting out.  Oh, we're cutting out.  Oh, we've got to go back then.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Yes. 
[02:51:30]  Wow.  500 people.  One expression.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Are you going to Italy again?  Oh, my God.  Opium.  I'm stuck with Ben Franklin.  He won't leave me alone.  I found a new friend.  I'll just now.  Hey, shut up.  Are we being broadcast?  Are we broadcasting again?  We don't even know at this point.  Yes, yes, yes.  All right.  We're back on the radio.  Okay, good.  Some of the stuff.  It's a mob scene outside of the UISP.  We can only go a few feet.  All right.  Why don't we stay right here?  All right.  Cool.  We know the kite, the key. 
[02:52:00]  Shut up.  The kite, the key.  All right.  All right.  Oh, Ben Franklin's back.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Good.  That's cool.  We'll stay here trapped.  That's perfect.  Oh.  All right.  We're back on.  This is good.  I feel like the elephant man back in the corner.  They felt like they needed to hear this, so we're back on WISP.  All right, Ben, did you want to say something?  Oh, Ben is back.  Jesus.  Next thunderstorm, I want to see you guys.  You know, I got a little kite and a key.  Ah, the kite and a key, of course.  You can hold the string.  Oh. 
[02:52:30]  But listen, here's a man who's wise.  You guys got to learn from this man.  You ever play Monster Rain?  You want to see how wise this guy is?  Take a look at his head.  He's not wasting all of his.  He looks like John Valvey.  Growing hair.  He looks like John Valvey.  You guys got too much hair on your head.  You're wasting your male hormones.  Oh, you invented that look, so.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Yes.  I invented the thing.  Very good, sir.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  I did it, Ben.  You've been terrific.  Cool.  All right, Ben.  Ah!  Here we go. 
[02:53:00]  Don't, don't, don't.  Look, look, it lights up when I run with the kite.  Ah, don't.  Listen.  Oh, he's back.  Yes, Ben.  I'll give you a charge.  It'll put a tingle in your, well, you know.  Oh, cut it out, Ben.  You're being too fresh.  You got a million of them, huh?  I don't know why I used that one.  A lot of people take.  I got a million of them.  I don't know why I used that one.  Yeah, I don't know.  I got lost.  I got trapped by a bunch of Japanese tourists crossing the other way.  Yeah, I was a Harry Krishna for, like, three blocks back there.  Howdy, howdy, howdy.  We're shaving your head and we're putting you in one of those. 
[02:53:30]  You ain't doing nothing.  I'll knock you down.  I don't care who you are.  I saw the Asians.  Threatened Ben Franklin, sir.  Threatened Ben Franklin's life.  Were those Asian people, were they, like, were they in a good mood or were they crying?  I couldn't tell.  Well, I don't know, but it was a, one of the guys was really macho.  He had, like, eight cameras around his neck.  He was, like, showing off, you know.  You don't have to go across the street.  You can sign that declaration.  Can he?  Put your signature down there, right over the top of John Hancock.  All right, we get it.  Yeah, you didn't like that guy.  You didn't like that guy much, huh? 
[02:54:00]  That John Hancock would show off with that big name.  You weren't any jokes from 1776?  Well, you're not old enough to be Ben Franklin.  How long have you been around?  300 years.  Wait, no!  Hey, when you hit your 300, you would know better.  Ben Franklin stinks.  Ben Franklin stinks.  Ben Franklin stinks.  How could you say that about a hero of our nation?  Let me ask you, how would you smell after 300 years?  Let me tell you something.  Hey, correct me if I'm wrong. 
[02:54:30]  Didn't Ben Franklin die a syphilis?  Seriously.  No, he did.  I tried, but I actually had a lung infection.  Oh, was that it?  You were.  Hey.  No, the thing is, like, you've been here for a while.  Well, you actually.  Ever since.  You talk.  I wasn't finished.  I heard George Washington had wooden teeth.  Any truth to that?  Yeah, you know, he never took.  I heard you had splinters in your johnson.  Any truth to that? 
[02:55:00]  Well, no, the thing is, like, we come here, we're kind of novices.  We don't know a lot about, like, where the Liberty Bell is, or.  Hey, you're right across the street.  Oh, no, go ahead.  I wasn't finished, but you can go right after anything you want.  Yeah, why would I talk?  It's only my.  You're here, man.  Okay, yeah, no, I know, I know.  But, so, if I wanted to go and, like, see the bell and maybe do something touristy,  it's probably around here that I'd want to go, you know?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, go ahead, go ahead.  You just jump right in whenever you feel it's necessary.  No need for me to finish.  I'll just throw out the thought, and you finish, and you steal the show.  Go ahead, you know.  Ask him where the declaration was signed, Jimmy. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, wow.  Ask him where the declaration was signed.  The Declaration of Independence?  Yeah.  Where was that signed?  Oh, come on.  Everybody knows at the bottom.  Oh, come on.  Is it true that the Liberty Bell was cracked when someone with Down syndrome banged their  head into it?  Yeah, listen.  Without that crack, it's just another bell.  This guy's terrific. 
[02:56:00]  He looks familiar.  Your face rings a bell.  Oh, hey, oh, hey.  Oh.  Well, that was a good punchline.  You know, the rest of the joke goes.  All right.  Don't you get on the business end of a glory hole somewhere?  Oh.  So, you are in the center of everything here.  The Liberty Bell, right across the street.  Declaration, Constitution, signed right over here.  Yeah.  For Anthony, right here.  Right.  I mean, everything important is right here. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  I like that.  And Ben Franklin, right here.  And where's Betsy Ross's ass at?  Oh, you got a thing for Betsy?  No, but, you know, that's where George Washington was.  She's a bit of a so-and-so, you know.  That's where George Washington was, helping her with the flag.  You know, wake, wake, nudge, nudge.  Yeah, put some snow in it, Betsy.  Put some yellow, put some green in it, Betsy.  She's a couple blocks away.  Yeah, nice.  Yeah.  Nice young lady.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A bit of a so-and-so, but she's a bit of a so-and-so.  Wait, what, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  Wait a minute.  I'm not sure what you meant. 
[02:57:00]  Well, you know, she'll keep you in stitches.  Who?  Betsy.  Betsy Ross.  You haven't heard of Betsy Ross?  No.  Flags.  What about her, though?  Red, white, blue.  She sews.  Now, Friday, why?  Go over there.  Get something stitched up.  I'm not sure if she's funny.  You know, with needle and thread, you know, put things together, sew it up.  So she'll leave you in...  She can sew you a rug for that, you know.  So she'll leave you in stitches?  She'll keep you in stitches.  Yeah.  Keep you in stitches.  Why?  You gotta explain to him.  I get it. 
[02:57:30]  He doesn't understand.  You don't understand about sewing.  You take a needle, you take thread.  Why would I do that?  You see all those clothes you're wearing?  Without a needle and thread, you'd be here naked.  No, you mean without a little Filipino boy putting this together for me.  Yeah, right.  That's right, man.  It used to be Betsy Ross, but, you know, her job was outsourced.  Okay.  Ooh.  All right.  Good talking with you.  Listen.  All right.  Just turn your back on her.  Maybe he'll go away.  Is he still there? 
[02:58:00]  No, I'll be...  Why is everybody...  Who is everybody sending this little man to me?  Who are you, sir?  All right.  Who are you, sir?  What are you?  I'm Michael Oslo.  What?  From Philadelphia.  From Philadelphia.  I listen to you guys all the time.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You want me to sign something?  Yeah.  All right, please.  Jordan and Jimmy.  Opie.  Uh, what?  What's up, Anthony?  I love you guys.  That's Opie.  I listen every day.  Thank you, sir.  There you go.  Can you sign anything?  I don't sign.  Sorry.  Oh, come on.  Come on, Anthony. 
[02:58:30]  Sign for him.  All right.  Here you go.  He's going, come on, Anthony.  Anything for the retards.  There's your picket liquor down there.  Oh.  All right.  Here you go.  Take care.  All right, man.  And remember, the weather's always good here in Philadelphia.  The weather's always good in Philadelphia.  Oh, it is?  Well, I like a thunderstorm, so.  Of course.  Again, the key.  Why, though?  Thunderstorms are annoying.  It's loud.  Food, all right. 
[02:59:00]  But there's lightning.  Frankus.  One more lightning joke, and I say we all beat him up.  Lightning strikes twice.  He's got good $100 bill jokes.  Oh, really?  A $100 bill joke?  You didn't know I'm on a $100 bill?  No.  No clue.  George is only on the one.  Yeah.  You know why?  Why?  It's his habits.  Why?  It's his habits.  He slept here.  He slept there.  He slept everywhere.  You don't hear that about me. 
[02:59:30]  Okay.  No, I know.  Wow.  I was there, but I never slept.  You stay awake.  You'll have more fun, and you'll be alive.  I want to hear more.  Back to the lightning jokes.  Those were doing well.  Like, lightning strikes twice, just like Joel Steinberg.  Whoa.  Kenny, that was awful.  He gave me his whole rap before, about $100 bills and picking up chicks.  Oh, well, let's hear that.  That's right.  Let's hear that.  You know, have you ever noticed when you give a $100 bill to a woman, she smiles?  You wouldn't believe what she'll do if you give her $10. 
[03:00:00]  $10 $100 bills.  For you, well, for you, she'll probably only smile, but for most of you, I believe it's  a financial issue I'm having here.  On Craigslist for $300, I can probably get what you get for $1,000.  Yeah, but not, you know, now that they're busting people for doing that, you know, you  might also get a free room and more.  Ben Franklin's a dirty boy.  You know that, right? 
[03:00:30]  Yes, he is.  There's something going on.  Well, it was pretty feisty back in the day.  You went over to France, and I heard there was a lot of women over there.  Don't listen to any of those rumors.  No?  No, they're true, but don't listen.  Don't listen.  Okay.  There's a lot of sex going on with the women in France.  Listen, if all the rumors were true, you'd all be related to me.  Would we?  And you might be.  The most romantic thing a woman has ever said to him is, are you sure you're not a cop?  I know.  Oh, wow, we're bombing.  We're bombing.  I heard the last time you were the woman, she said, is that all there is? 
[03:01:00]  I'm getting heckled by Ben Franklin.  That's right.  His face.  Thank you.  Is that better?  Oh, my God.  Heckled by Ben Franklin.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  Anyone else want to say anything before we go inside?  That's great.  Anybody got anything really good?  Raise your hand.  Talk to Club Soda Canning.  Anybody?  I mean, I realize it's tough to follow that.  Yeah, I know.  Ben was killing out here. 
[03:01:30]  Anyone want to flash Ben Franklin?  What?  Wow.  Huh?  Anybody?  I don't know.  It is audience.  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  I'm a sad man.  You know, so many of them are flashed.  Yeah, it is a little rough.  All right.  Like a woman.  All right, all right.  Cool.  Nice Rubenesque woman.  Most of these guys are looking for a woman.  All right.  Some of them.  Now where?  I guess we go back.  Go back this way.  Back that way.  And end this magic?  This has been terrific radio.  Thank you, Mr. Franklin.  Yeah, yeah.  Pleasure.  That was great. 
[03:02:00]  Pleasure to meet Mr. Ben Franklin.  Where are we going?  Right there.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  What's up?  Hi, fella.  Oh, we're going through this way.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I don't know.  Kenny's ushering us around.  Hold on.  I told this girl it's not in a shirt.  I did tell her.  Mr. Sweetie, thank you.  Oh, on the back.  Great.  I was going for the tits when I get the back.  Oh, I'm fine.  All right.  All right.  Well, tell Jimmy.  Hold on, Jimmy.  This guy's got something for you.  What?  Two blocks that way on 3rd Street is the best spa in the world for you. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, great.  There's 30 cops watching.  That's very smart, Sam.  No, no, no.  Yeah, FMP cards are all over.  You'll be fine.  All right.  Are they white girls, Asian girls, black girls?  Asian girls.  All right.  Good.  Really good.  Yeah, of course.  That was real smart.  We've got shitty little gifts for you guys.  We've got shitty little gifts for you guys.  Okay.  Made some shirts for the Philadelphia trip for you.  I know last time it was only two shirts for you guys, so we brought three cute little ones.  Oh, wow.  Let me see.  You're all shitty at night.  That's a night.  What's wrong with that shirt?  Wonderful.  I want that.  Me, too. 
[03:03:00]  Let me have mine.  Cool.  I'll take mine.  Thank you, sir.  Slip in a puddle of AIDS.  Jim Norton.  Good boy.  All right.  I guess we're going to move inside and try to do a broadcast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are we broadcasting the show out here?  We are, right?  I think we're going to continue broadcasting the show.  Stick around, you guys.  We're going to be talking to you some more in a little while.  What's up, baby?  What's up, bro?  What's up?  What's up, baby?  What's up? 
[03:03:30]  I like it.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Oh, thank you, mister.  We'll be back out in a while.  I got him.  I got him.  Okay.  All right.  Signing a few things as we make our way back inside.  You're very welcome, miss.  Hi, miss.  Wonderful.  How are you?  Oh, those lovely girls.  I'll sign this for a girl.  Oh, I guess a little flashing. 
[03:04:00]  God, that Ben Franklin.  What a scream.  I try to get as close as he can.  Thank you, everybody.  Without kissing him on the lips.  All right.  I got to go in.  Bill Dwyer in the lobby of W.I.S.P.  How you doing, man?  Hi.  Who will be the last?  Hey, what's up, Bill?  How are you, buddy?  Are we out there?  Can you hear most of that?  Yeah.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now. 
[03:04:30]  Bobby, Hockey, Bobby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to speak to XM Satellite is...  Fuck my shit, because they ain't give me no money.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, Cash Up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, niggas.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch. 
[03:05:00]  I guess we're on, right?  Yep.  We are back. 
[03:05:30]  This is XM only right now.  Now we can say...  Fuck, shit.  Motherfucker.  Holy shit.  What a collection of cock downstairs.  Yeah, I mean that in a good way.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  Where are the women?  There are a few out there.  This is kind of cute.  The guy gave me a little birthday thing.  He said, squeeze me.  Yeah, squeeze me.  Throw it out the window.  Squeeze it.  Squeeze it between your ass cheeks.  Wipe some shit on it and throw it back at him. 
[03:06:00]  Where's the guy?  Wait, can you guys hear this outside?  Yeah, they can hear you.  Where's the guy that gave me this?  Who's the faggot with the bear?  What?  Where's the faggot with the bear?  That's me, Jim Norton.  Where's the guy who gave me this?  No?  He's not going to fess up to it.  Jimmy, you don't know what he did.  He actually cut along the scene.  He beat off and shot some man chowder in his countryside cup and said, happy birthday.  I think he had a crush on you.  A little crush on you.  Where's the guy?  He sat there for like three hours at a Denny's at one of those claw machines trying to win 
[03:06:30]  that for you.  Wait, what?  And then another three hours working up the erection.  It said something.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Happy birthday.  Fuck you.  Happy birthday, you fucking jerk.  Happy birthday, you big fucking loser.  Happy birthday, you fuck yourself.  You know, sir, if there was a way for me to just give you cancer for this.  I would love it.  That window open, Doug?  Yeah, let's open the window and throw the gifts back.  I don't think the second window opens. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, God damn it.  You know what?  We got to start by talking about what happened outside because I have no idea what made it  to XM.  I have no idea.  I mean, well, that fantastic Ben Franklin stuff.  He was terrific, wasn't he?  Wasn't he great?  Opie, you laughing two inches from his face, that over-the-top stupid loud laugh when he  was just doing his usual shtick.  I tried to get as close as humanly possible without kissing him.  Yeah, I did.  Dude, that doesn't sound like a sincere laugh. 
[03:07:30]  And then as he's talking, and Jimmy's just like, oh, yeah, why don't you go ahead and  just talk?  Why don't you?  Poor old Ben.  Oh, killing me.  Poor old guy.  Just every day walks around, probably has pictures of people adoring him, taking pictures.  Yeah.  He runs into the likes of us and our horrific fans.  He just wants to walk around and not be spit on.  Right.  That's all.  That's all he's looking for.  But a nice crowd outside.  And then what happened now?  What?  Was there a technical glitch that happened when we went off the air? 
[03:08:00]  Why?  What happened?  What are you talking about?  We're still getting to the bottom of that.  Getting to the bottom of it?  All right.  How long were we off for?  Wait, what do you mean?  I don't think we were off.  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about when we got done with the broadcast.  Right.  And Danny, I believe, hit the sweeper.  Yeah.  For XM.  It might have been broadcast over YSP.  Right.  Oh.  Waiting to find out.  The sweeper for XM. 
[03:08:30]  With all the cursing and stuff?  Right.  I'm sure they dumped out of that, right?  That's pretty long.  How long is that one?  It didn't happen.  It didn't happen.  We're all good.  No curses, Gil.  It's all good.  Gil's saying no curses.  Very good.  Nice.  Very good.  That sucks.  We'll try harder next time.  All right.  Hey, Bill Dwyer's joining the program as well here.  I don't have cans.  Can you hear me?  I don't have cans on.  You guys can hear me?  Why don't we have some cans?  Oh, yeah.  We saw Bill Dwyer at Helium Comedy Club. 
[03:09:00]  Fuck, yeah.  All right.  Nice.  Yeah, there we go.  I'm back.  Now you can hear.  Let's go.  Were they good last night?  Everybody good?  Yeah.  I got a couple extra hours sleep, so I'm ready to go.  Yeah, you're all ready to go.  We've already done like three shows.  I know.  We've done over four hours already.  I know.  Those fireball fans.  Look at them.  My God.  Look at the energy.  Look at them.  Hey.  Who loves carbs?  Jesus Christ.  What a bunch of go-getters. 
[03:09:30]  All right, you people.  Someday he'll be tremendous.  Anyone else notice that Ben Franklin was close to a heart attack?  Yeah.  We walked the block, and he was huffing and puffing, and then he was in the middle of his  horrendous humor, and I thought he was going to drop dead.  He was sweating.  He was sweating, breathing heavy.  I love the fact that the Army just raised the age to 42, that you can join the Army,  and they said it's because middle-aged people are now in better shape.  Look at these people.  These aren't the people they were talking about. 
[03:10:00]  Miss, who's this lady here with the light blue shirt?  Who is she?  Yeah.  Hi.  Look.  Hey, who's that?  Who are you?  You're on radio.  Wave.  All right, honey.  She's got a body for radio.  Wow, a human beach ball.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Why would you say that?  She's a fan of the show.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  Come back.  Where did she go?  Opie's sorry.  What food cart did she run to?  She got walking away. 
[03:10:30]  That's right.  Bean it, fatso.  Bring her up here.  You're making us look bad.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that cruel?  Not cruel.  Don't do a deep knee bend.  Mr. Exercise.  Jim Norton.  That's not nice.  She's been working out.  She's got heavier silverware.  Go wallow.  There's a total of three vaginas down there.  You chased one away.  No, I chased two away.  One on the back of her neck and one. 
[03:11:00]  Go wallow in a buffet.  No, tell her we were only kidding.  We were only joking.  Bring her back.  Yeah, bring her back.  Come on.  Somebody lasso her.  We want to show that we're good guys.  Bring her back.  Tell her we were only joking.  Run her down the chute.  Tell her we didn't recognize it without her bifocals and buckle shoes.  How about the guy telling you about the nice spa that's a couple blocks away from here as the Philadelphia police looked on? 
[03:11:30]  There's fucking 40 Philly cops.  This guy's telling me where I can get jerked off for $20.  Dude, you want to whisper that stuff?  Really?  Maybe hand me a note.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait.  Right behind the sergeant.  Yeah, right there.  See that place?  This guy's writing the address on the back of a cop's business card.  Yeah, it's right over here.  Hey, no filter, Paul.  Did she leave?  Oh, well.  Where's the mic?  If you're going to talk to us, you've got to get at least close to a microphone.  You know how bad she's feeling about herself right now? 
[03:12:00]  As bad as she should.  Yeah.  No filter, Paul.  Go.  Go, go, go.  Talk.  What happened to her?  That was the wife of the guy that ate that stuff from the guy's ear that won seats on stage.  She just stormed off with the car keys.  Oh, really?  That was the wife of the ear infection guy?  The guy that ate the ear stuff.  At the ear.  You fucking limey.  The guy that ate the ear junk, that was his wife.  I now know why he ate the ear junk.  Well, maybe he'll kill me before I have to fuck her again. 
[03:12:30]  So I think there might be two seats available on stage now.  Oh, look at this mess.  All right.  Kenny, anything else going on out there that we could exploit?  I'll go find out.  Yeah, go find out if we could exploit anything.  Tell her we're just kidding.  Anybody else we can make fun of, that would be great.  Get her back on camera.  I'm not feeling too good after doing that.  Why?  I don't know.  It wasn't nice.  Wait, wait, wait.  Who's that one? 
[03:13:00]  Heartbroken.  It looks like her from the neck down.  What's going on right there?  Oh, shit.  That girl's got some big giant cans.  Nice.  Nice cleavage.  We gave you the chicka here if you want to critique the kiss.  Yeah, the kiss was the most unsexy mess.  You want him in?  Fucking watching Goldblum eatin' the fly with sex here. 
[03:13:30]  No, I just coughed iced coffee all over the board.  Oh, I feel bad that we chased that lady away.  I don't.  It's an old lady.  I'm just trying to get her back.  We can chase her away again.  Right now, her husband's fucking wiping birds off her back.  All right, Big A back in studio.  Ah, there they go.  You got a mic or something?  Cute couple.  Love to talk to the couple here.  The cute couple's back again.  Yes.  All right.  Horrible.  Now, we were thinking about the whole kiss thing and what happened there. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Big A, you seem to horrify her.  I'm sorry, what's your name again, dear?  Tammy.  Tammy.  Tammy.  You're talking to the mic, sweetie.  Yeah.  Yeah, Big A kind of horrified you.  No, it's just we're friends, and it's kind of like kissing your brother.  Nah.  Then why'd you volunteer?  Worse.  Worse.  They all volunteered me.  Well, it wasn't that.  That didn't have the better look.  No, it wasn't like kissing someone you're, like your brother. 
[03:14:30]  That was kissing somebody you were so completely repulsed by.  Your face was all scrunched up.  Your cheeks were clenched like you wouldn't accept his tongue.  What was that about?  No, it's just that we're friends, and yeah, I couldn't do it.  I'm not buying a friend story.  No.  I'm not buying a friend story, lady.  I mean, friends could have a couple of drinks, and they're, like, making out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe if I had a couple of drinks.  A couple of drinks?  Friends with benefits.  Yeah, exactly.  You didn't mind a pot all over your tits. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that how you hang out with your friends at school, but the kissing?  Yeah, the kissing.  Yeah, like brother and sister.  I don't buy that.  I fucked my sister.  She didn't make a face like that.  Wow.  Is hooker etiquette?  Everything but kissing?  Yeah, a lot of them.  It's too personal.  Big A, what did you think of the whole thing?  Yes.  How was it?  You know, the guy's throwing a knuckle in her sausage wallet, but the kiss is too much  for her.  The guy's better than her throwing a couple of tongue darts in her crusty dung bunker, 
[03:15:30]  but the kiss is too much.  That's where you got to show her.  Unwashed analingus, fine.  Big A, how'd you feel about the kiss?  How do you think it went?  It was definitely holding back.  You felt that?  Yeah, because we were friends.  Yeah, that's why.  Because you're friends.  But you didn't hold back.  You grabbed a whole of those big titties and you started like...  Big A is a true entertainer.  At least admit you want a banger.  Yeah.  You know why?  That's how this whole thing started. 
[03:16:00]  Well, in the past, yes.  Well, how many times have you jerked off to her?  Why not now, though?  I mean, in the past you wanted a banger, but you don't want a banger now.  Why?  Yeah, have you ever gone home and jerked one off after thinking about her?  You ever to fire her?  No, not at all.  No?  No.  You ever watch her angrily on Pal Talk, just gritting your teeth and masturbating?  No.  I heard you were really pissed one night at some event, some pest event, because she  went there kind of with you and then ended up going off with other guys and stuff, and 
[03:16:30]  you were all pissed.  Story I heard.  Story I heard.  She's seen more dickens than weekends.  That's what we're hearing on the street.  Seriously, what's the deal with that?  Now, wait a minute, Tammy.  Now, you made a face when Anthony said that.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  When you went to the pest event and snuck off with the guy, what happened?  Yeah, it went to the pest event and there was some other guy.  Oh, no, it was the pest event.  It was Michael and Heather's wedding reception a few weeks ago, last month.  That was at FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in the heart, excuse me, of Huntington. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  Yes, my brother's a restaurant.  Wonderful place.  Thank you.  All right, so it was an event.  I had just met for the first time a lot of my friends from fullblownaids.com.  Right.  It's a website, just go with it.  So you were going there, too?  And then I was hanging out with a lot of them, and I had seen Andrew a lot before and everything.  I didn't mean to blow him off or anything like that.  No.  I didn't leave.  I left.  We all left together.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But you kind of considered... 
[03:17:30]  I didn't look up with anybody.  Your belly was a little fuller when you left.  Let's not be honest.  Yeah?  Someone said that there was some hanky-panky going on, and you may have been on the business  end of a flesh musket in the paint closet.  That is totally untrue.  I'm not...  All right.  You said it's nice.  After talking to Ben Franklin, he adds in a historic reference.  I like that.  He's smart.  He's smart.  He's a musket.  But you had bigger, more feelings for her than she ever had for you at the beginning. 
[03:18:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  And you were a little upset that she didn't share the same feelings.  It's natural.  You basically wanted to be her boyfriend, and it bothered you that she looked at you like  a repulsive burden.  Right.  Of course, you're going to put it in...  That would be a lot.  No, I mean, he was having feelings for her.  He thought he cared enough about her that, you know, he could bury her in a shallow lake 
[03:18:30]  bag somewhere.  It was really...  It was like that kind of relationship, and it didn't work out.  Why wouldn't you give Big A a shot?  He's a sweet dude.  Yeah.  He is, but, you know, the distance and everything, and...  Well, the first...  He'll move.  He'll relocate.  No, he's not really my type.  Oh, no.  What is your type?  Well, you said...  Hold on.  You said friends.  Women always complain that guys just want to get in their pants.  Right.  They don't view you as people.  Now, here's a good guy.  Granted, you're listening to him talk is a bit of a chore, but, I mean, he's a great  guy, so he looks at you as a person.  The most important thing about our relationship is we're best friends. 
[03:19:00]  There you go.  And she's saying...  Well said, Doug.  Well said.  And she's saying one asshole in her pants is enough.  Is that what you're saying?  Is it the size and the shirt?  Because it looks like a big dinosaur should be spitting acid at you.  It looks like Newman from Jurassic Park in the woods.  So what's the problem?  Oh, well, it was trying to communicate by phone and everything, and my cell phone bill just  got too high.  Wow, that is an excuse. 
[03:19:30]  You're blaming it on a poor cell phone plan?  No, the length of the calls.  Her whole network's hiding right now.  So if O&A pick up your cell phone tab, you'll be glad to hook up with it?  No, no, no.  No, I'm seeing somebody else now.  Oh, no, you are.  Who are you seeing?  How does he feel about him?  Is he here?  No, he's on FBA.  Oh.  You're seeing him?  Well, you just kissed Angela, though. 
[03:20:00]  I know, he's proud of me.  He just texted me that he was very proud of you.  Oh, who is he?  You can say who he is, right?  His name's Shadow on Full Blown Aids.  Is he black?  No.  Okay.  Well, Shadow, you never know.  All right, we've got to go to the phones.  Thank you, guys.  We'll, I don't know, maybe talk to you.  Did you enjoy the kiss, though, just as a kiss?  How do we do this?  As a kiss?  Yeah, it was fine.  I tell you, I wasn't even, I was watching.  It was very uncomfortable for me just to watch it.  Yeah.  I couldn't imagine it was enjoyable for anybody involved.  I missed it.  Can we see it again?  No, you don't want to see it, Bill.  You really don't.  I do. 
[03:20:30]  You don't know what kind of odd sexual hungers I have, gentlemen.  All right.  Can you guys kiss for Bill Dwyer?  He's a big-time comedian.  He was on Last Comic Standing.  He's playing the Helium Comic Con.  Bill's hosted this.  He's a friend of mine.  I don't want to be embarrassed in front of my good friend, Bill.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, quick kiss.  Quick kiss.  Yeah.  No, but you guys, here's the thing.  You guys were very good to do that.  Yeah.  But you didn't use any tongue.  It didn't feel like a real kiss.  I mean, I've kissed girls before.  I didn't feel like a girl-boy kiss.  Nope.  Quick and deep.  Yeah.  That's something like that.  One time.  Yeah.  That felt like a hitchhiker, a salient kiss. 
[03:21:00]  Try and reach uvula.  That's all.  Wait, what?  Tell the truth.  What was the...  His breath is kind of stinky.  Oh, now it comes out.  Boy, Big A, you're always getting that rap.  You're always getting that rap.  Big A, Dwyer always has gum.  Big A, you can't take that.  Ow.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Hulk angry.  Hulk angry.  That thing is going through her skull.  No, wait.  No, wait.  Hold on.  What does it smell like?  It's no big deal.  We all have it sometimes. 
[03:21:30]  I have it, too.  I need too much coffee.  So what?  Yeah, you know.  No, it's just...  Yeah, just...  You know, just...  It's not minty fresh.  Stale.  So the guy...  Musty.  So you're saying chronic halitosis is a turn-off?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Does it smell like a coffin?  Come over here and smell it.  No, it's a coffin.  Poor Big A.  Look at the poor guy.  You're talking about him like he's not even here.  So you're saying that...  No, no, no.  Poor guy.  So we all have it once in a while.  I'm sure he's never had it before.  The stick of gum is fighting its way out.  Big A, comment? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  How are you feeling right now, Big A?  Honestly, we talked about it.  I'd be embarrassed, too.  Are you embarrassed?  Yeah.  A little?  He's mortified.  Oh, Big A.  I think B.A., put a couple of fingers in her and see how she smells.  Yeah.  That'd be fair.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Poor Big A.  What are you embarrassed Big A for?  He's a great guy.  All right.  We got Tracy Morgan on the phone?  Oh, okay.  We got to talk to Tracy for a few minutes here.  Tracy, we got you?  What up? 
[03:22:30]  What up?  Oh, we made this work.  Cool.  They're answering the phone in New York where it never works.  What's up, Tracy?  I'm chilling, baby.  Who's this?  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jimmy Sugar.  What's up?  It's Jim Norton.  It's Bill Dwyer.  It's Doug Stanhope.  My brother's from another mother.  What's good?  Hi, Tracy.  Are you in town yet?  Yeah, I'm in town.  I'm on my way to filming my TV show right now, man.  I can't wait to see y'all this weekend.  It's going down, baby. 
[03:23:00]  It's going down.  Wait, you're in New York or you're in Philly?  I'm in New York.  Oh, okay.  We're in Philly right now.  Yeah, we're in Philly already.  Cool stuff.  I'm going to meet y'all there this weekend, right?  Yeah, kid.  You guys shoot in New York?  Huh?  You guys shoot your show in New York?  Yeah, we shoot in Queens over at Silver Cup.  Oh, okay.  We're right on the floor under the Sopranos.  Oh, it's called...  What's it called?  It's 30 Rock.  30 Rock.  And what's the girly show?  Oh, the girly show is the show that's inside 30 Rock. 
[03:23:30]  But the TV show that we're doing is not really based around that show.  It's based around the characters and their lives and their workplaces and stuff like that,  you know?  Is it like the comeback in a sense where it's about someone who's on a show, but it doesn't  focus on the show that they're on?  Yeah, it's like that, you know?  It's like...  It's based around Saturday Night Live.  You know, the writers and their life and how they live and how they work and how they  are in their work environment. 
[03:24:00]  So, you know, that's what it's based around.  Oh, so it's you, it's Tina Fey, Alec Bowlin is in this?  Nice.  Alec Bowlin, Jane Kowalski, and Richard Dratch, all of us.  Very nice, dude.  Hey, hey, Tracy.  What's up?  What was that picture of you in the Daily News, was it, or the post?  Are you licking some girl's foot at some bar?  Freaks come out at night, man.  Freaks come out at night.  Who was that broad?  How drunk were you?  That was my wife.  Actually, that was my wife. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, then I won't say broad.  I've been married there for 21 years, man.  And you still lick her feet?  That's how the Daily News get down.  They didn't put that part of it.  No, they didn't.  I was sucking some random girl's foot, you know?  That's what it looked like.  I was proposing to my wife to marry me again.  You know, this is her second marriage, you know?  Again.  We worked through a life this time because we got a little dope.  And your wife bought this story, by the way?  Yeah.  And you were licking her foot?  That was your foot, sweetie. 
[03:25:00]  Sweetie Pie, that was your foot.  That's an Asian foot.  What are you talking about?  That was a big foot.  That was a great picture.  We laughed really hard at that one, Tracy.  Thank you, baby.  You're getting married again because now you have some money?  Yeah, man.  The first time we did it, man, we did it.  You know, it was at the courthouse, city hall type joint, man.  You know, I always wanted to give her a nice big wedding.  You know, so she could invite all her friends, so all her friends could wish her bad, you know?  So 20 years later, you decided to get married again. 
[03:25:30]  Maybe I could phone one of her friends in the back while they cut the teeth.  Don't you decide to get divorced after 20 years and not get married again?  Yeah.  The first one was actually kind of...  I'm not going to get divorced, man.  It's cheaper to keep her right now.  I heard the first one was kind of formal.  They painted your shotguns white.  Huh?  I'm pretty lucky, man.  The sex is still good, you know?  We still doing our thing.  We're trying to make a baby right now.  Oh, you are?  You're going for another baby?  Yeah, man. 
[03:26:00]  Try fucking.  Try fucking.  I heard it works.  I got three boys, and now I need a girl to balance everything out.  Now, let me ask you, you're married, man.  One girl to three boys.  That balances everything out.  You're a pervert, man, like I am.  So do you try to keep that at home, or do you kind of go elsewhere for the real filth?  No, I go all out, man.  It starts at home.  Everything starts in the home.  Me and my wife do a lot of role playing.  I just bought a Girl Scout outfit the other day.  Nice.  I think I'm going to get a couple boxes of cookies. 
[03:26:30]  I told her to go outside and try to sell me some cookies.  Oh, I thought you were wearing it.  I would really be wrong.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  The other day, I made it dress up as a newborn baby, and I dressed up as a thermometer.  I dressed up as a butt thermometer.  Be careful if you're doing it in the butt, bro.  Make sure that they don't get pregnant. 
[03:27:00]  No doubt.  Yeah.  You can get pregnant doing that in the ass.  In the ass?  Yeah, where do you think lawyers come from?  Oh!  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!  Now you're going to walk the lawyers downstairs as well as the Batgirl.  We're walking this weekend, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're going to do a lot of walk-up tomorrow.  Yo, you guys are rock stars, man.  I can't believe the people that come out, yo.  It's like frigging awesome, man.  Yeah, that PNC show is... 
[03:27:30]  I've been being in front of that many people.  I know a million comedians that will never be in front of that many people.  Yeah, we did, what?  Over 12,000 at the PNC.  Yeah, it was very good.  Wow, weed.  Yo, that was rock the roll.  Backstage is awesome.  All the chicks in there, man.  Plenty of titties and ass and coochie cat.  I love it.  Tracy's the real deal, man.  It's the real fucking deal.  And whenever you guys rock, please put me down.  Yeah, of course. 
[03:28:00]  And you could put us in your new TV show.  How's that sound?  Yeah, I want to party.  All right, so when is your show premiere, man?  It's not until October the 11th, right?  October 11th, we're busting out.  30 Rock, yeah.  30 Rock with Tracy and Tina Fey.  I'm coming to party with y'all, y'all.  Okay.  All right, Tracy.  We'll see you at the Tweeter Center tomorrow night here in Philly.  Rock and roll, baby.  See you later.  All right, see you tomorrow.  Thank you, Tracy.  All right, Tracy Morgan.  Very cool. 
[03:28:30]  I don't know how to hang this up.  You just hit the...  No, take the other thing.  Then do...  But no, it's the...  I got to say hi to Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mark.  Um, the husband of the, uh, of the late, uh, girl you just, uh, made fun of?  Yeah.  We didn't just make fun of her.  That was, like, 15, 20 minutes ago.  Yeah, really, man.  Get your facts straight.  Yeah.  Yeah, man, you got to give her a break.  She just had a baby a couple weeks ago.  No, dude, we were just...  A baby what?  We were just...  You might want to go back to the hospital. 
[03:29:00]  You might have had twins.  Wow.  Hold on.  Hold on, sir.  Let us finish laughing.  No, she had a baby, which explains why she had hay on the back of her shirt.  Oh, my God.  Why are you setting them up that easy for us?  All right.  All right.  No, no.  Look.  Yeah, there was some things said, and we kind of felt bad that she walked away.  We were kidding you.  I still feel bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, the whole time she was on her pregnancy, she was all doped up on steroids because of 
[03:29:30]  some breathing problems, and that's why she gained the weight in there.  Oh, so that baby's illegitimate.  That can't go in the record books.  She was also...  What, was there too much food in her windpipe?  Yeah, she was also doped up on Twinkie.  That baby's name's got an asterisk next to it on your birth certificate.  Dude, we were just joking.  Where is she?  We'll apologize.  I actually did feel really bad about that.  Yeah, we're really good at smoothing things over.  Yeah.  We're assholes, but we also are good at smoothing things over.  She won't do it.  Why?  What happened was this.  This is why we kind of teased her, because I saw a girl sitting there. 
[03:30:00]  I'm like, who is that?  Because it was a chick who I hadn't seen, and she stood up, and all of a sudden she just  left.  Is that?  Huh?  She's sitting here crying right now.  Oh.  Let's completely rewrite history.  Why?  Look, can we talk to her?  Yeah, we don't even talk to her.  Yeah, you don't have to put her on camera.  Just let Jim talk to her.  Jim's real good.  I'll shut up.  We'll smooth things over.  Jim's really good.  I'm telling you, man.  You're going to want to do this.  You've got to get the relationship back in.  It'll make your life easier when you go home, dude. 
[03:30:30]  Jim's good.  Yeah, well, she just told me the XM stuff has to get out of the house and everything now.  Well, tell her, look.  Well, tell her the snack foods have to also leave.  Yeah.  Oh, babe.  Oh, come on.  That's right.  Hey, tell her, would she prefer them if they were double or triple XM?  What does she get?  She's crying in her bowl of ice cream right now, fellas.  You're really...  Come on, eh.  Hey, dude, we're trying to just have fun.  Take a squeegee.  Wipe those tears off.  See if she'll talk to us. 
[03:31:00]  Dude, how long have you been together?  We've been almost four years.  Okay.  Four years.  Now, did you have any kids before you met?  No, this is our first kid.  All right, our first kid.  How much did she weigh when you met her?  I would have to say probably about 115.  Yeah.  Oh.  115?  Listen to the groans.  Where'd you meet her?  In a fun house?  On Venus?  Was this the guy that ate the earwax stuff?  Yes.  Yeah.  This is the guy.  So, eating the earwax is okay. 
[03:31:30]  She can live with that.  But a couple fat jokes is too much.  Is that what you're telling me?  All right, man.  You know how girls are, are they?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  She's a little sensitive about the obesity.  We were just trying, like...  Here's the thing.  We weren't going to fuck with her.  I was just actually asking who she was because I saw her.  And then she just stood up and, like, kind of a...  Oh, the phone.  Oh.  Let's hope that's Richard Simmons.  No.  Seriously.  Jimmy, you don't know because obesity is a problem.  I read an article that said obesity has gotten so bad in America that two out of three people,  have now become four out of five people. 
[03:32:00]  That's how bad it's gotten.  That's how bad it's gotten.  Bing, bing, bing.  Wait.  Hey, dude.  Dude, what's her name?  Michelle.  Michelle.  Michelle.  Let's talk to Michelle.  Michelle.  Let Jimmy talk, Opie.  Yeah.  Because Jimmy...  I will apologize.  Jimmy will smooth things over.  He's very sensitive, and it'll be easier for you to go home.  You won't have to get rid of the XM.  You've seen him do this before.  I can't do that.  I really want to have a marriage after this. 
[03:32:30]  Well, you don't have a marriage, dude.  What a fucking marriage.  Did you?  All right.  I got to punch out.  My wife's really upset.  All right.  Well, before she grabs the phone and eats it...  Wait.  What is she saying?  She's just yelling.  Hello?  What a fucking...  Put the fat cunt on the phone.  Get off the phone, man.  Holy Jesus.  What a fat curmudgeon.  Wow.  She should get stuck in the mud running from lions.  Fucking storm off at two miles an hour. 
[03:33:00]  Sir, have some balls.  Stand up.  You've been sticking your dick in the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Don't take that shit.  Oh, my God.  The nerve of her to yell at you.  Oh.  God almighty.  We had to give you a ticket and eight for her for the traveling virus.  She weighed 115.  115 pounds.  We need someone from outside to tell us what's going on with this.  What's going on out there?  Yeah, someone grab the mic outside there.  They marched off? 
[03:33:30]  They left?  Oh, they left?  Yeah, they left.  Oh, okay.  She's probably got a feed bag on right now.  She won't get far.  I'm sure the cops will shoot her with a tranquilizer dart.  She lifts up her blouse to be little bruises from where guys were hitting her with 10-foot poles.  All right, well, that's enough.  Is it?  I don't think it's enough. 
[03:34:00]  How much is too much?  Listen, we're going to take a break.  Not yet.  No, but there's a lot more coming.  But yeah, that shame will probably make her get into shape.  You know, she'll go home and cry, but she'll start hitting the treadmill with bitterness.  That's right.  She'll be one of those bitter, thin people.  It doesn't matter that she's thin because she's all stretched out and useless.  She doesn't weigh much, but if you saw her naked, you'd still retch.  I think you did a good thing.  Her ankle fat will get caught in the mechanism of the treadmill. 
[03:34:30]  God, dude, I think this will help her, man.  She's going to fucking jump on the treadmill, and then her husband will fucking send it back  and say it was defective because it's broken, and then she'll have to get another one  that maybe is a bit more weight ready.  That's a long way to go for a mediocre fat.  She fucking falls into the Grand Canyon and clogs it.  I heard he didn't want to leave when she took off, but he was orbiting around her at the time.  Fucking poor guy.  He's going to drive one of those stupid horse rental trailers.  Stick her in the back. 
[03:35:00]  She hangs her head out the back and complains.  I don't want to be made into glue.  I don't want to be made into glue.  She's standing there on the street, a car running out of gas, trying to get around her  in the intersection.  She really bugged me.  All right, let's go to Jason from Wyoming.  Hey, Jason.  Jason.  Wyoming.  Can you see her from there?  All right, we lost Jason.  No big deal.  All right.  We're live in Philly.  We've got to take a break.  Don Marrera is going to give us a call in a few minutes. 
[03:35:30]  Okay, I know.  I will apologize, sir.  I thought there was something on your shirt.  It was like a little bit of plankton.  I apologize.  I made fun of you.  See, the phones are on work and we've got some great lines going in.  Mr. Motherfucker from Whackbag, what's up?  Yeah, I just got an update on that fat bitch.  Yeah.  She was last seen throwing barrels at two Italians.  Her poor husband.  Oh, God.  Poor husband that just ate ear pus. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Well, now you see why.  Yeah.  A hundred and fifteen.  Probably the only thing that she hasn't eaten.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Mr. H.  Mr. H.  Good morning, boys.  I just wondered if that woman was about a size 14.  Would you?  Would you?  All right, bro.  See you.  We'll take a break.  You're a great big fat person.  It's Opie Anthony, Jim Norton, and a bunch of our friends here in Philly.  The great thing about being with a broad that big is you don't even have to really find 
[03:36:30]  the hole.  You just got to take a roll of fat and just kind of roll over.  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah.  That's right.  Just kiss her.  What?  You never done that?  No, you fuck her wrist.  All right.  We'll continue.  Get us out of here for a little bit.  Presenting Opie and Anthony in-studio visitor guidelines, number 37.  Don't fuck the underage drunk guests.  Oh, mister, you're so tall.  Shh.  Not on the air.  Stay tuned for more pearls of wisdom from your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:37:00]  All right, that was sad.  We're back at XM Satellite Radio, the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're broadcasting live from WISP down here in Philly.  We got a lot of people outside the studio checking out the show.  They can hear us.  Right, guys?  You can hear us?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Very nice.  Tomorrow's going to be a great, great time at the Tweeter Center.  I think we're going to do very well with the walk-up. 
[03:37:30]  The weather's supposed to be perfect for comedy and drinking.  What is a good weather forecast for comedy?  Rain, so half of those drunks stay home.  And one of the guys, we got 10 comedians tomorrow, Dom Herrera, on the phone.  Dom!  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hi, Dom.  What's up, Dom?  Looking forward to hanging tomorrow night.  Yeah.  You got a good crowd, huh?  Why didn't you come in?  It would have been nice to see you.  I'm down the shore.  I'm down, I'm like 100 miles away.  I'm down in Walrus.  Oh, did you do Vito's Club? 
[03:38:00]  I did it, yeah.  I did it last week.  And then I just stayed down here.  I grew up around here.  Oh, okay.  Did you stay in a hotel or what's family?  I stayed at a house, you know, a friend's house.  Hey, Dom, how was that Sports Illustrated football phone of yours?  Oh, it's really, you know, starting to wear out.  You got a horrible phone.  Nothing on that?  That was pretty good.  I didn't know that you were telling the truth.  And I went old school on that.  Yeah, it was pretty old school.  But that was good, right?  You really had that phone?  Brought it back.  No, it sounds like you're talking like from Tim Cairn. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hard to hear you.  It's all right.  We can get it done anyway.  Well, you know, it's weird.  It's because I'm on the regular phone because I didn't want to call on my cell phone because  I thought that would be fucked up.  Well, now look what you did.  What'd I do?  Yeah, you picked the wrong phone.  Hey, can you see a big fat broad from where you are in blue?  You said you're a hundred miles away.  We just chased a nice big fat girl.  She was outside kind of wrecking the aesthetics. 
[03:39:00]  And we were trying to look at guys.  Yeah.  I'd rather look at fat cock than that fucking monster of a woman.  All right, hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  What happened?  Hey, Don, we should explain.  No, I'm...  We got Jimmy Schubert in studio.  We got Bill Dwyer in studio and Doug Stanhope in studio, so...  How are you, Dom?  Yeah.  Get Doug to tell you about Ireland.  Yeah, we already mentioned it.  Oh, we went through that.  Nobody brought more love to the Irish people than Doug. 
[03:39:30]  It was actually...  One night after, he goes, I did better tonight, huh?  I said, well, yeah, they didn't fucking hang you.  Like older times, they're chasing him around with pitchforks and torches.  Turned out, please.  So all these guys are on the show tomorrow night?  I'm not.  I'm at Healy and, Dom, Dwyer.  No, we just picked up a couple more guys on the way, because we're kind of taking over  Philly here.  We went and saw Bill Dwyer last night, and Doug Stanhope, we just found out he was playing 
[03:40:00]  some rock club or something.  Say, hey, come on by.  Say hi.  Yeah, I didn't think Dwyer could crack that lineup.  Oh, no.  Wow.  What the hell, girl?  Damn.  I was never as happy in one day of my life as you are every day.  It's a facade, Dom.  It's all a lie.  You seem pretty happy.  Huh?  You seem happy.  It bugs me.  Really?  Tears behind the laughter, my friend.  It doesn't bug you.  Yeah, exactly.  Inside, man, there's a rolling ball of hate. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  We're all right.  Hey, how's Schubert doing?  I'm good, man.  How are you doing, brother?  Good, Jim.  How are you doing, brother?  Out of curiosity, there's four comedians here.  How are we dying?  All of us.  Yeah.  All of us together.  There's four comics, and we are just fucking dying and stuck with this part of syndrome.  No, five of you include Dom.  What's that?  Nobody wants to push it.  Nobody wants to appear like they're doing a bit.  It's that low that comes after making fun of a fat girl.  That's true, too.  Yeah.  You serotonin dips. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, we're starting to feel bad about ourselves now that the mics went off for a little while.  Yeah, we're in a spiral of shit.  We were alone with our thoughts, and it wasn't good.  Yeah.  The angry mob is dispersed, and it's just you with blood on your hands.  Dom is right, though.  Nobody wants to seem like they're doing a bit.  That's exactly what's funny.  I thought of that, too, as I was going through the airport last week.  There you go, Jimmy.  There's a lot of stuff that happens in airports.  Yeah, I mean, what does the TSA stand for? 
[03:41:30]  Take scissors away?  Hey.  Oh, hey.  It's our power growing.  Super is never afraid of sounding like he's doing a bit.  At least they're quick, though.  Yeah.  At least they're quick.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to turn a camera on, and you watch what happens next.  Yeah, we just panic.  We panic and freeze up.  We'll perform for the camera.  I guess there's a local Philadelphia station that wants some B-roll or something, right?  Where are you from?  Some C-roll.  I heard Norton killed at the PNC.  Well, get our mic for that.  Thank you, Dom.  We don't bite.  Hold on. 
[03:42:00]  We got the media people in here.  Yeah, it was actually really good.  The whole show was great.  Nobody bombed.  No bad sets.  It's good.  Hold on.  We got a news person coming here.  Yeah, just start beating the fuck out of him like that Fox reporter.  Yeah.  Apparently, the cameraman, though, just stands there and tapes it.  Doesn't jump in to help.  But the sound went off, so he really wasn't doing his job.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Me and Doug just posted it.  Oh, good God.  I saw it, too.  What?  That was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.  What?  CNN just showed it.  What's a newborn baby?  A kid being born?  Right on CNN.  Oh, mucusy.  What is it? 
[03:42:30]  Why are they showing that?  It's called a baby.  Because he was born right before 9-11.  Hey, would this be a wrong time to plug my bananas date?  Let's get the lady on the show here.  You're from CNA?  Yes.  Mary Masterson from CNA Money Matters Today.  Money Matters.  Money Matters.  Ooh.  Really?  She sounds hot.  Money's important.  It always matters.  That's true.  So every story you do has to have some kind of a hook about finance and how it'll affect.  So how is taking B-roll in here? 
[03:43:00]  She's a gold-digging whore.  She is not.  You saw right through me.  You saw right through me.  What awful things are you going to say about us?  What awful things are you going to say about us as this video is running?  Because that's what we're used to.  No.  You guys are great.  I'm so excited to be able to come in and sit down with you guys for a couple of hours.  Don Marrera on the phone?  I'm a good Catholic girl.  You know what I'm doing.  We know the angle now. 
[03:43:30]  That should be even.  I'm in now.  That's good.  Me too.  And everything always relates back to money, so we get to do a little bit of everything.  Please don't ask about St. Pat's.  We're done with that.  Oh, no, no.  Hey, I'm a good Irish Catholic guy.  I'll fuck you without a condom on you.  Not because I want to.  That's what the Pope says.  Don't use condoms.  This is XM Satellite Radio that we're broadcasting on right now, so, you know.  Huge fan.  Oh, I am.  Thank you.  So what's the story really going to be about?  Really, how you guys balance the two.  I would think that satellite and traditional radio, you'd kind of be competing against. 
[03:44:00]  Boring.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  For a finance show, that is like the ultimate story.  How you get through hours of broadcast, not cursing, and then come here and let it all  hang out.  Do you feel like you're holding your breath?  Yes.  I'll give you a good answer.  Yes.  What do you think about baseball during the regular show?  Holding it all in.  It's like, I always use the analogy, when I was younger and dating, like in high school, 
[03:44:30]  you'd go over to the parents' house of the girl you're dating, and you'd have to watch  your language.  Right.  And then the XM version is breaking in later and fucking her mother.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  I didn't like that math.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was a great analogy.  Oh, that was a great analogy.  That deserved a lot more.  All right.  So, as a good Catholic girl, it's all about, for the first couple hours, I'm the girl you  take home, but then in the last couple hours, I'm the freak in the bedroom.  You're the fat girl, right? 
[03:45:00]  You're going to get to stick it in your ass.  We drop you off, pick up the whore, and you wonder why you're itching the whole next day.  Are you single?  I'm sorry.  Are you single?  Yes, I am.  You're very lovely.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, what are you doing single?  Professional girl?  I don't know.  Are you on the TV?  Are you familiar with Mr. Norton's proclivities?  I'm a producer.  I'm not on TV.  Oh, you're a producer?  Nice.  Do you ever get freaky?  You know, every once in a while.  She's a girl.  I don't talk about it, though.  She's a financial...  I have to keep up my image. 
[03:45:30]  She's into Jewish bondage.  She likes having her money tied up in an IRA account.  Hello!  Please!  I'm trying to be old.  I've been here all weekend.  Hey, and Tim, you want to tell her what you're into, or are you a little shy today?  I know.  I don't mind.  She seems like a lovely lady.  You guys might hit it off here.  I love that you keep calling me lovely.  You are.  You're very sexy.  I'm big on hair pulling and things of that nature.  Hair pulling.  I'm a big hair puller.  Yeah.  Did you see how long my hair is?  No, I wouldn't grab the bottom.  That's a rookie move.  You've got to grab it up by the head.  A rookie move, huh?  Yeah.  That's the way a retarded person grabs your hair when he's scared of thunder. 
[03:46:00]  You don't grab the bottom.  You have to...  Fuck it in at the root.  Yeah, you grab up the back.  You can pull the head that way.  But you don't push the head down.  What?  No, no, no.  I hold the head steady, and then I fuck it.  Yeah, yeah, no, no.  Don't break her across the board.  Really?  Fuck it like a pumpkin.  I think you're for the ladies out there.  Fuck.  Yeah.  You're not into a quick gag?  I'm not into...  Just a quick...  No, you can't push us into it.  We've got to want to.  Don't say us. 
[03:46:30]  A lot of girls like to...  They like that.  Yeah, yeah.  I prefer to push.  I prefer...  Don't sum up half of the population of the earth.  All right, but I'm just, you know, representing the good Catholic girls that I hang out with on the weekends.  For me, it's not good oral sex.  If she doesn't go, all right, all right, shut up.  That, to me, is the sign of a good hummer.  Yeah, slobber and tears.  That would be one out of a blowjob.  You know what?  Slobber and tears.  I would love to know the dialogue they're going to put over us all laughing and everything.  It's like a good time was at as they talked about finances and stocks.  Yes.  We can't show you what they actually said. 
[03:47:00]  But they were talking about, you know, XM stock and things like that, of course.  Huge.  You live here in Philly?  Yes, I do.  And you have roommates?  Do you live by yourself?  I live with my sister.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  What floor do you live on?  I'm the oldest.  There's eight.  What's that?  I'm the oldest of eight.  Wow.  So I'm the authentic.  Is Dick Van Patten your dad?  Five girls and three boys.  Five girls, three boys.  Wow, that's a big fan.  Hey, Dom.  Yeah.  You got anything for her?  I just want you to describe her to me so I want to hear what I'm beating off to. 
[03:47:30]  She's about, let me see, hold on.  You're about, I'm seven.  I'm five, nine, so you're probably about.  You're five, nine?  I'm five, six and a half.  Five, six and a half.  Five, six and a half.  You're about five, seven, five, six and a half.  Yeah.  She has long brownish hair.  She has a pretty face.  She's wearing a white shirt.  I can't really see through it.  I can see through it a little bit.  Very sexy.  Thanks, I'm done.  Oh.  Let me just wipe my stomach. 
[03:48:00]  She has very healthy, sexy.  He came at the five and five, seven.  She's got a great set of sticks.  Very, very, very nice legs and very sexy thighs.  Her jeans are hugging them in a delicious fashion.  And she's got the baby bear and hips, you know.  Yeah, nice.  She's really sexy.  Baby bear and hips.  Jimmy.  And her backside is.  In the house.  Wow.  Oh, no.  That's nice.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Okay, I don't know.  Is that another cock?  Oh, my.  I don't think I could. 
[03:48:30]  I know.  You're like a filthy schoolteacher.  Hey, by the way, again, thumbs up for the pal talkers.  You're on the pal talk camera?  They love you.  Oh, no.  Or someone is seeing you because they're on the phone saying you're totally hot.  Yeah, she is.  Probably someone with a computer downstairs.  All right.  I don't know.  Last morning, I've had a long time.  Wait.  What?  Nothing.  Say that again?  Nothing.  Listen to me.  Last morning, I've had a long time.  How do you feel about spanking, seriously?  I'm sorry?  How do you feel about spanking?  Spanking?  Being spanking.  Yeah.  For real. 
[03:49:00]  You like it.  Seriously.  What do you think?  I think the pause means she likes it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Should we turn it off the camera?  It can't be.  Like, it has to be, you know.  How about if it's not for sexual reasons?  Like, how about if it's for, like, really.  Actual discipline.  Yeah.  Okay.  You've been naughty.  Like, if we're going towards the S&M, you're just scaring me.  Right.  Because that's just scary.  Okay?  I can't even watch it on, like, real sex.  I can't do it.  Okay.  But, you know, like, a little, like, grab.  Like, a good grab that, you know.  A little mild fisting is always good. 
[03:49:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Nothing crazy.  Don't go up your elbow.  Like, up your wrist, you know.  Not going there.  Of course not.  Sorry.  Nice.  Again, bringing it back to the good Catholic girl.  Nice girl.  Why don't you have a boyfriend, do you think?  I don't know.  Do you look?  Do they, are you doing things?  Are you working at it?  I am.  I'm out there.  I've been told I'm too nice.  I fall into the friend zone.  Last relationship.  When was it?  Last serious relationship.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, two years ago.  Two years?  What happened there?  He was an asshole? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That's pretty much what it came down to.  He had a cock.  He went to Nashville, Tennessee.  I'm not doing that.  What the hell's there?  Yeah.  You know, can you see me on fringe?  No.  Hey, can I ask you to do something?  It's pretty tame, actually.  Okay.  You see Jimmy?  Look at his arm there.  The hairless is embarrassing.  I know.  It's so hairless and smooth.  There's a couple, like, just fine hairs that stick out.  Can you just touch his arm and check it out?  I will.  I'm intrigued by the star.  I'm intrigued by the star. 
[03:50:30]  It's wood.  How did you get that?  Shark bite or?  No, I was drunk and I sliced it with a razor.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  He tried to kill himself.  He's serious.  He's serious.  I was waiting for you, you know, like you fell over the toilet, something like that.  No, cute story.  He was suicidal for years.  No, I was actually, there was a building.  Into the wrong side of the arm.  No, there was actually, I was actually in a building.  Yeah.  It had to be evacuated.  And I, uh, I cut this trying to help an old lady out of her pants.  That's a much better story.  That's a much better story. 
[03:51:00]  Much better story.  She used that with the ladies, because that was her.  She can hang, man.  So now, a serious relationship two years ago, but when was the last time, you know, maybe  a little romance happened?  Oh.  You know what I mean by romance?  Yes.  Ass sex.  There was a guy that I really liked, but he was from Idaho.  I used to travel a lot for work.  Yeah.  And that was a problem.  We did the long distance.  Cock's like potatoes out there right here.  Oh my God, you know.  Short, fat, stubby, eyes on him.  And dirty.  Eyes on him.  He was originally from Ohio. 
[03:51:30]  I like Midwestern boys.  I think they're great.  Yeah.  You kind of set me up with the fucking guy.  I could give a shit about him.  I just want to know what, like, what happened.  So that, you know, like, that kind of, it wasn't anything really serious, but that was,  you know, that ended, like, six months ago.  Let's just call it, like, oh, oh, I thought it was like a one-night stand thing.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  It went on, but.  Yeah, but, you know.  So you've been celibate for six months?  Yeah.  Really?  Come on.  No, really.  Not even.  I'm groaning.  I love it.  Yeah, I know.  I was just groaning.  There's not a woman in here.  Yeah, there's a couple. 
[03:52:00]  There's one.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There's a couple.  She's hiding.  Okay.  They're back there.  You got to take care of your business stuff.  I am.  I am.  I can feel right.  No, no, I mean, you got to take care of yourself, like, business, you know.  Do you want that?  You release the pressure.  Chillin' off.  What's that?  What?  No, no, no, no.  What he means is, like, when it builds up frustrating physically, you have to relieve your own pressure.  You have to relieve yourself in bed maybe later.  Yeah, it's okay.  I'm just saying, like, I'm trying to keep it as vague as possible, you know, even though  it's satellite radio and I could say you have to pull out a big black dildo and just 
[03:52:30]  shove it.  But I could say that, but I'm not.  Yeah.  I'm saying.  No.  And hold on one sec.  Dom's trying to get in here.  Yes, Dom?  You know what?  I got to do WYSP in Philly now.  Oh, Jesus.  That's right over there, though.  That's right across the...  You got to do Bart?  All right.  Plug our gig, will you?  Are those guys, they can see me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You want to flash them or something?  No, no.  I just wanted to say...  Could you show them your underpants?  No, no.  All right, Dom, we'll let you go.  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right, Dom.  Let's go on, Dom.  Are you wearing a thong?  For sure.  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Let's go on, Dom.  Oh, the bow on the thong.  That's sexy.  Yeah, the bow?  Yeah, let's see the bow.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't believe I'm chilling.  Why not?  Let's show the bow.  Sexy.  Turn.  Turn.  What are you wearing?  Slower.  Turn slower.  God damn it.  Can the guy see it?  That is my little white thong.  That is nice.  Give her a wedge.  Let's see the...  No.  This is the greatest day of my life.  Get up.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Wow.  There's a little bow.  There's like a gingham check on there, too.  That's a purple...  That's a purple...  That's good.  I filled up a little.  That's really nice.  I filled up. 
[03:53:30]  Jimmy's just now going to be grabbing his dick the whole time.  Yeah.  I'm working for luck today.  Hey, you want to see Jimmy's now?  I would love to.  All right.  Okay, it has to be Boxer Brief.  Otherwise...  All right.  Wait, let me see.  That's all I can...  Whatever they are, they have shit in them.  All right.  Here.  It's only fair.  Now Jimmy will...  Now Jimmy will...  I need something.  All right.  Now Jimmy will give you a little something.  Okay.  It's only fair.  Here we go.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, no.  Show her the back.  They're Boxer Briefs.  They are, but they're a little...  Show her the back, though.  A little what?  Dingy? 
[03:54:00]  No, these are...  No, they're perfectly...  Oh, dingy.  Off gray was the color that he bought them.  See?  Oh, yeah.  Well, they're not brand new sparkling white, but there's no loads or logs in them.  I mean, they've been washed.  Jimmy, show her the back.  That's the best part of the underwear is the back.  Yeah, show her the back.  His underwear looks like a high school parking lot.  Nice!  That's what I'm looking for.  Awesome.  Jimmy's hairless little boy ass.  Now we're even.  I feel much better.  These are Boxer Briefs.  Thank you.  Thanks for...  Your ass should move to Thailand. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's smooth and hairless.  It's not even gay if you fuck me on your count.  For me, it would be a mold more.  I love the t-shirt, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  A lot of people say I look like him in this picture, so I just got it.  Really?  I can see the resemblance.  For sure.  Of course, Elvis Presley.  Yeah.  A young Elvis Presley on Norton's court.  And who doesn't want that?  Well, everyone in this room.  Apparently Priscilla didn't.  She'd rather fuck a karate instructor if you read the books.  Are you guys Larry David fans?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  I'm never tired of that.  My favorite one is where he goes back to... 
[03:55:00]  Is it the young Ava Gardner or...  Boring.  We're boring again.  He says that he's going back because Cheryl's pissed at him because...  Who's Cheryl?  Why?  Did he put his foot in his mouth?  No, he was...  Is that the one where there was that awkward moment?  I had enough of him already.  Is that the one with the mayhem ensues?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another misstep?  Then it all gets tied up together at the end.  Yeah.  Add a coincidence to a misstep?  It works out. 
[03:55:30]  All right.  Is that the one where they don't script it?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I can't believe she called my underwear dingy.  So how...  Yeah.  Why don't you run off crying like the fat girl?  She called my underwear dingy.  I'm getting rid of my ex-mails.  But they're not dirty.  No.  No.  Not dirty.  I want to clarify.  They're putting all your laundry in the same.  They're washing your whites and your colors together.  I do that myself.  I do my own together.  The second you put whites and colors together...  Problem.  Problem.  That's right.  I think it's dingy.  Absolutely.  When you wash your clothes or anything else in life, whites only. 
[03:56:00]  I'm a lot of mongrel class of undergarments.  Hey, are you looking for a date, by the way?  Always.  All right.  Bring in Big A.  I want to bring A.  We got Big A.  We got the perfect guy for us.  We actually have a guy...  Wait, wait, wait.  Before Big A.  Before Big A.  He's our new guy.  What is your ideal guy?  Give us a brief description.  Looks, personality, your ideal man.  Blindfolder.  You and Andrew have to share a mic, though, when he comes in.  Okay.  That's fine.  You're not going to think it's fine in a few minutes.  He's a guy. 
[03:56:30]  Tall.  I like...  Big A's tall.  Dark hair.  Dark hair.  So far, we're two for two.  I like him to have a job.  All right.  He's got a job.  You are three for three.  Three for three is his first three.  It's something that's very important.  He needs to be able to carry on a conversation.  Absolutely.  He does...  It carries on and on and on.  Let me tell you something.  The guy does the news on our show.  Really?  Well, obviously, he's informed and carries on a conversation.  He's a professional.  Yeah.  What's your name?  What's your name?  He's in the same industry as you are.  All right. 
[03:57:00]  So, okay.  So, what else?  You give four for four.  Okay.  Our look's important.  So, I'm sorry?  Our looks, yeah.  How important it looks to you, things like that.  Honestly, you know, it's the get because you see that guy cross the door and you're like,  oh, wow.  I want him to go.  Absolutely.  Yeah, you'll go, oh, wow.  Yeah, you'll go, wow.  I hear you.  He has a wow factor.  Yeah.  But, honestly, I mean...  You're going to go, wow, ooh.  When it comes down to it, it's really about personality.  Personality.  I know that's cliche, but...  No, it's not.  It's nice.  If you can't carry on the conversation, if you're an idiot, it's just, I'm done. 
[03:57:30]  Right.  I don't want to minbow.  I think it's in his chest.  I hear you.  I hear you.  I think we should just bring him in.  Smart.  Yeah.  You got to share a microphone.  Do you mind sharing a microphone?  Okay.  That one's broken.  You know what?  Can we maybe blindfold her?  Blindfold.  Blindfold before we bring him in.  I want to see.  I want to see.  Only because...  I want to see if love is blind.  I want to see if love is blind.  He has a creepy shirt on.  Here's the problem.  He has a creepy shirt on.  Yeah.  No one's going to touch you or anything creepy.  No one's...  We're not idiots.  We swear.  Well, you got the camera guy, Roland.  You got all this, Perry.  We won't do that.  You're getting evidence.  Don't worry about it.  We won't do anything like that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Perry's got it. 
[03:58:00]  But the bottom line is he's embarrassed about his stupid shirt and he's like, we had him  with a girl before and all she's doing is...  Because his shirt, I'll tell you one of them, it looks like it has like fucking palm trees  on it.  It's abominable, his shirt.  Yeah.  Okay.  And we'll allow you to touch him and stuff.  So his fashion isn't that good.  That's what I'm talking about.  It's awful.  His shirt.  The rest of the pants are fine.  The hat's fine.  All right.  I like the Hawaiian on him.  Because I got to tell you, the way a guy wears pants, also important.  Yeah.  Oh, cheers.  Well.  Yeah?  How'd you think of a handsome little fella named John Carr? 
[03:58:30]  He wore his pants, huh?  He wore his pants well.  That's right.  He wears the pants in his family.  Oh, yeah.  He wore his pants well.  He certainly does.  His pants were good.  I tie her up.  I need a blindfold.  I'm sorry.  No, a little blindfold.  Just a blindfold.  And this way, I think you should, like, well, guide your hands to his shoulders.  Right.  Okay.  And then you could start from there and kind of feel what kind of a man is in front of you.  Because he is manly.  You like manly men?  Always.  Or a little wussy man?  So I'm playing like a...  No, you...  It's like a blind dating game type. 
[03:59:00]  Mary Ingalls Wilder.  Like, I'm blind.  Very good.  Mary Ingalls Wilder.  And she watches Little House.  Anthony grew up on it.  I love it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We want her to...  With that blind school burnt down.  I want her to...  They can share a mic, right?  Yes, they're going to.  All right.  Listen, listen.  We want her to...  We want you to touch his face and comment, his shoulders.  Maybe his...  And ask him questions.  Maybe his belly, you know, he works out a lot.  You know, that type of thing.  But you have to sit...  Hold on.  Move over a little bit because you're going to share a mic.  I don't want you moving with the blindfold on so you don't fall.  Okay.  Now stand there.  There's a chair right behind you. 
[03:59:30]  Okay.  So you know where you're at.  All right.  Make sure she's safe.  Very good.  All right.  The blindfold is on.  You can't see, right?  He's harmless.  Just don't...  If you see...  We've got to get him another shirt.  Steve, check.  I don't want her seeing.  There you go.  You just pull that down.  She's not going to...  All right.  She's good.  She can't see.  Hold down like this.  You don't need to pee.  We're not going to put up...  She's got to breathe.  Hey, she's got the t-shirt.  I'm ready.  All right. 
[04:00:00]  Bring in Big A.  You've got to share a mic.  Hold on.  I'm still...  Big A.  I can guide her.  Okay.  Bring his handless.  Yeah, make sure you're talking to the mic.  Hold the mic so you know where you're at.  All right.  Here comes Big A.  Andrew.  Big A.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Big A.  She's going to put her hands on your shoulders.  Someone guide her hands.  And then just feel the man.  Hold on, Andrew.  Don't talk, though.  He's tall.  Put your one hand on his head, too.  Feel how tall he is.  He's a tall guy.  He's tall, right?  He's a big guy.  All right.  What do you think so far?  What do you think as you touch him?  He's a little warm.  He's a little warm? 
[04:00:30]  He's a little warm.  He's been outside.  Okay.  So he's outside.  Very healthy.  All right.  Big A.  Take your hat off so she can feel your hair.  Yeah.  Run your fingers through his hair.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's wrong with the hair?  Okay.  No.  It just feels a little cherry curl.  Yeah.  What he does is he puts way too much...  He just ran up the stairs to meet you.  That's okay.  Move your hand down to his gullet.  Feel his gullet.  I like the scruff.  You like the scruff?  Feel his chin, his neck.  Nice.  Nice.  You can stick a whole fish in that gullet. 
[04:01:00]  Nice.  Very nice.  Ask him questions.  He's very big.  Okay.  She's going for the nipples.  I like that.  She's tweaking his nips a little bit.  He has very nice breasts.  Wow.  That's good.  Now she's down to...  Okay.  He's definitely a silly guy.  He's got nice round tummy.  Yeah.  This is the beer belly.  Yeah.  This is the Philly signature beer belly.  So, you know, that's good.  It's good to be a Philly guy.  And...  And what about the bottom?  What's out of his pocket?  Oh, it's a tumor.  What about the...  It's not there.  You want to feel his butt?  No. 
[04:01:30]  Well, it...  It's right in front of you.  It's right in front of you.  It feels butt.  Oh, it's a little flat.  Okay.  Nice.  A little flat.  Nice.  Turtle.  All right.  And...  Turtle.  Snake skin sneakers.  Snake skin sneakers.  I'm so interested in what this is.  Because this is a lot of...  What is that?  Is it probably his phone?  That's a big fed cock.  It's a big red ball.  It's a running fed rubber ball.  Wow.  Jesus.  Big A's packing, man.  It's like...  What did he have in the pocket?  A big red ball.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now...  It's a big blue ball in his pants.  Now, Big A, she also likes a guy that can carry on a conversation. 
[04:02:00]  So, get on mic.  And talk to her.  Now, you see her.  Ask him some questions.  You see her.  Yeah.  Ask him a question.  Get to the mic.  And have him answer.  All right.  We want to get a reaction here.  All right.  Where would you take a girl on a first date?  Where would you take a girl on a first date?  Microphone.  Where would you take a girl on a first date?  Oh.  I would...  Ah, charisma.  I would take her to a quiet and romantic dinner.  A romantic... 
[04:02:30]  Get her up on the mic so she can talk at the same time, too.  Yeah, we can hear.  Okay.  Now, where is the last place you took a first date?  Like, where is your spot in Philly?  Where's the best place to go?  The mic's creaking.  Leave it there.  I mean, I'm not going to Gino's.  So...  There you go.  Where are we going?  Now, just...  Just lean in.  Talk in.  Lean in.  Go ahead.  Actually, I don't know too many places in Philly.  Uh-oh.  Actually, I live in New York, so I don't know too much about Philly. 
[04:03:00]  Oh, okay.  That's right.  This is in your ground.  I forgot.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's okay.  It's really understandable.  A lot of great places in New York.  We love New York.  Maybe you want to know about his love life, his personal life, things like that.  What he does.  All right.  Yeah.  What do you do?  It's very important to me that the guy is employed, that he has a job.  So what's your job?  Lean into the mic.  Why are we cab in the Bronx?  Oh, really?  Yes.  Okay.  So you know your way around.  So you give me a toy. 
[04:03:30]  It's so sweet.  Yep.  Fantastic.  You know your way around.  Okay, so now if I go there, now I get...  You're going to take me around for free, right?  Like, I can pile my friends in the back.  I can't hear it on the mic, Big A.  Hold on.  I cannot hear Big A.  Of course.  Yes.  Okay, but I also expect you to know the hot spots, because I'm going to, you know,  bring some girls.  We want to be out on the town.  He's recoiling from his breath.  Do you live in the Bronx?  She's now eight feet away from the mic. 
[04:04:00]  How did that happen?  I like the Bronx.  Yeah, if you could both get right on top of that mic, that would be nice.  Yeah, because we can't really hear.  Only because we're sharing one microphone, because the one left, he has his brother.  So both of you, it's just...  Big A is going to tell her what he likes, you know, in a relationship there.  Yeah, what do you look for in a girl?  Go ahead, Big A.  Go ahead, Big A.  He's nervous.  Mike, k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k.  Get on mic there.  Get on mic.  All right, go ahead.  Don't creak it.  Stop creaking it.  Yeah, stop creaking the mic.  It's creaking.  All right, tell her what you like there, Big A.  Oh, he's waving Than off, all right? 
[04:04:30]  Go ahead.  Not good enough, Than.  This will be your last appearance on the show, waving Than off.  All right.  Jimmy, help her up to the mic a little more, because...  No, he wants to...  I know, yeah, just move a little closer.  I was just waiting.  I don't mean to hear, but he's looking for it.  Talk.  Go ahead, Big A.  Get on the mic, Big A.  He's actually a nice girl who just has a humor.  Get on the mic.  A good personality who just has a humor.  Okay, but you can't be nervous. 
[04:05:00]  Girls want confidence.  They want you to strut in.  They want you to...  Big A, tell her what you like in bed.  Tell her what you like in bed.  He's a nice guy.  He's not going to hurt you.  Yeah, just tell her what you like in bed, Big A.  Yeah, what do you like?  What turns you on?  All right.  Get on that mic.  Aztecs.  I'm out.  No, no, he means receiving it.  He wants to gut someone's ass like a housing and urban development project.  All right.  Is she ready to take it?  Do you have ladies back in the Bronx where you're from? 
[04:05:30]  She completely recoils.  It's hard to pick someone up in a cab.  A lot of hookers are in cabs, you know.  They certainly do.  Did you see her go, whew?  Like, whew?  Oh, you know, I'm a dirty boy.  Yeah.  So, Big A, how long have you been single, Big A?  Get on the mic.  Yeah, you guys, I don't know.  She's a professional.  She should know about her.  Yeah.  It's only because we apologize for how he wants to be the mic.  You can kind of imagine where the mic is. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, what seems to be the problem with the microphone?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you want me to be heard of?  Both of you should be heard of.  I'm sorry.  Now we can hear you.  I was trying to share.  Yeah, that's okay.  Now get on that mic, Big A.  I'm on it.  Now stay there.  Now stay there, and Big A, now you get on mic.  Now tell her, really, what do you like in a girl?  What do you like?  Tell her.  Personality-wise and stuff like that.  Get right into that mic.  Go ahead.  She can't hear you.  She's right into the mic.  Pop it.  Tell her what you like.  Get to the mic, jackass! 
[04:06:30]  I just like the personality.  What?  Dude, you're not on the mic enough.  I'm on the mic enough.  No one can hear you out there.  Yeah, you've got to get right on that mic.  I can hear you if I hear your voice.  Dude, honestly, God, can I hear you?  Tell her you like girls that are hot.  But now we can't hear your response.  You've got to step up to the mic a little.  It's okay.  I'll, you know, do a little swivel.  There we go.  A little swivel, all right.  Look her in the eye and say you like girls that are hot. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  Hot like her.  You should be used to talking to blindfolded women, too.  All right.  Let's make it more comfortable.  Just say, look, I've contacted your family.  They understand everything.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Take the, why don't you take the blindfold off and get a look.  Can I, Andrew?  And then we can.  Get it right on mic as she takes the blindfold off.  There could be.  It's a little hot in there.  Yeah.  There's a love connection. 
[04:07:30]  He was the first person who said hello to me when I came here today.  Oh, see.  Very cordial.  Very nice.  Sweet guy.  So, Andrew, how beautiful is Mary?  Very nice to meet you.  Andrew, get on mic.  Isn't she pretty?  Here she is.  Yeah.  She backs away every time.  I'm not sure you're being coached into saying that.  I know.  No, he's shy.  Are you kidding me?  He just said yes.  I don't know if a neck has a rotator cuff, but hers almost tore, spinning, swiveling her  head. 
[04:08:00]  Wow.  Well, that was good.  That was kind of a cool little way you two kind of met.  It's always nice to meet a New York guy.  Do you think, now, I might be a little bold here, but do you think, just from this brief  little meeting, that anything more can happen, maybe between you two?  Maybe you take him out tonight and show him to maybe...  You know, but my last relationship was long distance, so I'm trying to find someone here  in Philly.  Would you be willing to relocate, Big A?  Jesus. 
[04:08:30]  It's a fucking ancient room.  They're turning on you.  No, they're all volunteering because they're from Philly.  Uh-oh.  Uh, any relocating possibilities?  Get on mic there.  It's always a possibility, yes.  Always a possibility.  See?  Now, you never know.  Fantastic, because you know what?  I walk all the time.  I don't drive my car, so I'm always looking for a good cab driver that can have on call.  You know, we'll go out and hit the town.  Well, Big A, you're going to be in town tonight, correct?  And what are you doing?  Andrew, microphone.  Yeah, I'll be in town all this weekend, actually. 
[04:09:00]  And what are you doing this weekend?  Are you busy?  Plans?  Maybe you can...  I do have some plans.  Oh.  I have to babysit tonight.  All right.  Babysit.  He's a great babysitter.  That's good.  He's wonderful.  Yeah, he absolutely is.  They stopped crying immediately?  Yes.  He, uh...  They stopped crying immediately.  Yes.  Look, Big A Yates.  It was very nice to meet you.  All right.  Oh, wow.  I don't think there's a love connection.  Yeah, we tried for you, Big A. 
[04:09:30]  We will get you somebody, Big A.  All right, Big A.  Get the hell out of here.  We love Andrew.  0 for 82.  Wow.  Yeah.  One of these days, we'll make it happen for Andrew.  He was sweet.  He was so sweet.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Something was sweet.  Two.  Two.  All right.  So, what happened now?  Andrew, we wanted to be blindfolded because...  Yeah, he can't hear you now.  He's back in the isolation booth.  Yeah, he's actually gone.  We, we, uh...  No, this is not on YSB.  This is only on satellite radio.  Okay.  We, we...  Why didn't you...  We like Big A's.  He's a sweet guy.  So, what happened?  Really, the biggest thing for me would be that he was nervous.  I, I need confidence.  That's something that you see in the room. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  You know, and you're attracted to.  And the fact that he was so nervous.  You're a liar.  What about the things you can't see in a room, but other senses pick up?  What about the yellow sweat pouring off him?  What about that?  What about the, uh...  What about his essence when you were picking up his essence?  Right, right, right.  When you were sharing a mic, did you notice anything?  Well, yeah.  The...  I, I put that into the fact that he was nervous.  What?  For what?  That's, you know...  I'm lost.  I think he was very sweaty, you know, and so that was a little...  How could you tell? 
[04:10:30]  Um, because I touched him and there was, you know, it was wet.  Yeah, was there any, um...  The halitosis.  Any smells.  Right, right.  Because I noticed you recoiling when he would talk into the mic.  What was that all about?  I can't hear you.  I was just trying to be polite and sharing the mic, you know.  We had to, we couldn't hear.  Oh, oh, gosh.  What a nice man this is.  Are you going to have to burn those corals for everyone that you're wearing?  All right, so what, sweetheart, what were you saying?  I'm sorry.  Um, no, just really it's about confidence because, you know, that's it. 
[04:11:00]  Purelling.  You weren't answering the, like, what was, uh, what was, why were you recoiling?  It was weird.  Yeah, there was a little bit of a recoil.  He wasn't talking too loud, I'm saying.  Was there something going on, maybe?  Uh, there was a, there was a little bit of a, you know, a little, there was a little.  Of raw sewage?  Well, you know, I was just trying to give him his face.  A breath issue, perhaps.  Yeah, yeah.  A little space for his.  Was it the ginger virus?  Was it the angel out?  No, no, no.  It's kind of like in the Green Mile when the guy opens up his mouth and the bugs fly out.  It's like that.  It's kind of like that.  All right, we've got to get out of here, so. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, damn.  It's 1125?  Yeah, we've got to do some interviews.  Bonus show, you sons of bitches.  I didn't.  We gave you bonus show.  I don't want to read shit tonight.  That's right.  Now Mary and I are going to the broom closet.  Woo!  Oh, yeah.  This was a thrill for me, seriously, guys.  Thank you so much.  I wish we could save this.  Thank you.  Oh, I hope he's a hard one, man.  Jesus.  All right, listen.  Before we leave.  Well, we've got to say goodbye.  No, we've got to play the Imus thing. 
[04:12:00]  It's a minute.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I want to say, I want to wait for the people out there.  Yeah, no.  Well, uh, Imus did a nice.  The, uh, Imus in the morning show.  He was talking about us today, uh, on his radio show.  Mary Levin?  No, not yet.  No, no, no.  I was just looking for my water.  Can I have a hug?  I think someone's going to call me.  All right, we'll get you water, okay?  I'm a big hugger.  Are you?  Sure.  Ooh, let's all hug Mary.  Jimmy, don't let go.  That was nice.  Mary smells really good.  Wait, what is it?  Yeah, she does.  Wait, Jimmy wants to hug you again.  It smells really good.  Yay. 
[04:12:30]  Don't let go.  Don't let go.  Don't let go.  It smells good.  What is it?  Can he hug you one more time for all of us?  I'll hug you nice.  I won't be crazy.  Yeah.  I think it's just my lotion.  All right.  Well, let Jimmy hug you.  If it's cool.  Didn't we just, well, with the eldest, you know.  Yeah, all right.  That's just my girlfriend.  That's just my girlfriend.  Hold on, hold on.  How did you lick her?  Who's that, Jimmy?  I'll call you back.  I'm about to bang a reporter.  All right, listen. 
[04:13:00]  Let's play the Imus thing.  Jimmy, I think he was plugging you, actually, today.  I love Imus, dude.  All right, let's listen to what Imus had to say this morning.  And I'm getting my Opie and Anthony t-shirts, and I understand we don't have to deal with Opie's brother.  We went right to the source, I'm in.  We got together with E-Rock, the producer of the fine Opie and Anthony program, who has assured the office that you will be provided with one of every version of the Opie and Anthony t-shirt, the pest, the whackbag.com, all of them. 
[04:13:30]  How about the little Jimmy Norton t-shirt?  Hang on.  I want one.  Isn't that part of O and A's deal?  No, no.  Jimmy has his own separate entity.  That's the part of Jimmy.  Jerry's trying to get out of line.  We don't need that.  Eatabullet.com.  He's not that funny.  Oh, okay.  He's going out on his own here.  We don't need that.  No.  If it's not for Opie and Anthony, what's he doing? 
[04:14:00]  Where's loyalty?  He's opening for Rob Bartlett at Chuckles in Newark.  Well, that's not exactly true.  He's on Lucky Louie, the HBO program.  Oh, no.  The fine HBO filthy sitcom.  Okay, great.  That's good.  Well, that's really taking the country by storm.  Yeah, that's, you know, you've got to tell me about something.  Yeah, you're right.  He stinks.  Do we have a shittier clip we could play?  That clip stunk.  Jesus.  I swear to God, I had no idea where I was going.  How did you get to open for Rob Bartlett? 
[04:14:30]  That guy's good.  I'm actually doing a benefit with Rob Bartlett.  How did I tell you?  If you've got to tell me about it, I don't know about it because I'm on the cutting edge  of everything that's going on at 105 years old.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  I swear to God.  That was shitty.  You had that look of...  I was all happy.  Like, I might as well talk nice about me.  Oh, boy.  Ah, fuck him.  Enough of my being nice to you.  Fucko.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, I mean, she started something down, man.  You have the wrath of Norton on you now. 
[04:15:00]  Jimmy, I swear I had no idea.  Oh, dude, I know.  They just cut the audio.  We figured it's been nice all along.  Yeah.  He had to be fucking hateful at one point.  Right, great.  That wasn't Rob's fault.  The streak is over.  That's fucking over.  That's it.  We're officially at war with everybody.  That's right.  No more being nice to that fucking cadaver.  Fuck him.  Fuck him, Jimmy.  Oh, what a way to end.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  Jimmy Schubert, we'll see you tomorrow night.  Absolutely.  Yes.  I want to get a traveling virus. 
[04:15:30]  Tweeter Center tickets still available.  Bill Dwyer, Helium Comedy Club here in Philly.  Helium tonight, tomorrow night.  Yeah.  I'm going to actually end it.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Jimmy's going on.  A lot of fans could go see you tonight, and then they empty the club and come see us tomorrow.  Beautiful.  Nah, Bill Dwyer's going to do just fine at Helium.  And, of course, Doug, thank you so much.  Thanks for having me.  What are we plugging, Doug?  Worcester game.  Worcester, Saturday night, Boston Sunday.  Right.  First time we saw you.  DougStanHope.com, it's all in there.  And first time that Doug has been in studio with us.  You did great, man.  It was a blast, man. 
[04:16:00]  You're a lot of fun.  I've never retched into a wastebasket on video before.  I know.  That was really nasty.  Dude.  That ear pus.  That's going to be a tough visual to shake.  Hard.  And we've got to thank the ONA Pest outside.  Thank you, guys.  Yes.  Absolutely.  The Pest.  Those awful humans.  They've been out there like five and a half hours.  Thanks again, guys.  We'll see you at the Burrito Center tomorrow night here in Philly.  If not, have a great weekend.  We'll see you on the radio on Monday, all right?  Bye.  I'll see you on Monday.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee. 
[04:16:30]  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God. </pre>
