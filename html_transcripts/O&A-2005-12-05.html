<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between them.  The show began with a post-mortem of their annual eggnog drinking contest.  The debate centered on whether Pat Monaki or Eric "Badlands" Booker was the true victor. Booker officially won based on the "puke, you're out" rule, but Monaki may have set a new record for most shots consumed before vomiting (71 double shots).  Audio of their vomiting was played, eliciting reactions from the hosts and Bonnie (the show's engineer).  Pat Monaki later called in, and the hosts also discussed his strained relationship with his father.

The show then transitioned to a scathing critique of Howard Stern's appearance in a Boy Scout uniform, utilizing homophobic slurs and mocking Stern's perceived need for attention. This led to broader complaints about management's outlandish publicity stunt suggestions.  A caller, Louie, shared an anecdote about Stern's 60 Minutes interview, prompting discussion about childhood experiences and racial tensions, further punctuated by homophobic slurs and a story about Opie's experience at an all-black public pool.  The hosts also extensively covered their MySpace rivalry with Jim Norton, detailing their tactics for gaining friends, including using provocative images.

Steve, a show producer, called in to recount his disastrous bear hunting experience in New Jersey, which involved being tranquilized and lowered from a tree.  This sparked a humorous discussion about hunting practices and animal rights. The hosts also discussed a gay bear convention they encountered in North Carolina, adding to the show's offensive and controversial commentary.

Stand-up comedian Rich Voss and his wife, Bonnie McFarlane, were in-studio guests throughout much of the broadcast.  The hosts discussed Voss's old stand-up routines and hairstyles, and engaged in sexually suggestive and crude jokes.  Bill Burr also made a guest appearance, creating an awkward moment when Francine, another guest, mentioned Dave Chappelle, a clearly off-limits topic.

A significant portion of the show focused on the development and execution of a new segment called "Tissue Time," involving live phone sex with listeners.  Several callers, including "MySpace Debbie" (a model from South Dakota), "Jay," "Michelle" (later renamed "Beth"), and "Stephanie" (later renamed "Allison"), participated, with the hosts providing real-time commentary and direction.  The hosts also played audio clips from the eggnog contest,  NAB commercials criticizing satellite radio (which they mocked), and a celebrity sex tape sound-alike game, revealing Tom Sizemore as the celebrity.  Bonnie McFarlane discussed her past experiences, including a negative relationship and her role in the sitcom "Social Studies."

Movie reviews were interspersed throughout, including negative reviews of *Ice Harvest*, *War of the Worlds*, and *The Constant Gardener*, and positive comments about *Harry Potter* and *King Kong*.  Sarah Silverman was also a guest in the studio, engaging in brief, suggestive exchanges with Rich Voss.  The hosts also planned a future "Money Snatch" contest involving women collecting cash in their vaginas, with explicit discussion of the contest's mechanics.  The show concluded with discussion of the success of "Tissue Time" and promotion of upcoming shows and appearances by the hosts and guests, including Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane's performance at the Miami Improv and an interview with a potential intern, Sean, known for his sharp suit and poker habits.  The conversation throughout the broadcast was frequently punctuated by offensive language and controversial topics relating to race, homosexuality, and body shaming.

[00:05:30]  I'm laughing again over the...  I'm laughing at the sound clip.  Yeah, the last time we were live, we did the eggnog drinking contest.  Yeah.  And, wow, what a day.  What a day, what a day, what a day. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, was that fantastic.  I was thinking about the eggnog drinking contest over the weekend.  Yeah.  And I want to start a little controversy.  Why?  Papamunaki lost, right?  That seems to be what happened.  And officially, he did lose.  Yeah.  Because the rules stated that you puke, you're out.  Right.  And who won?  Eric Booker, Badland?  Badlands Booker.  Eric Badlands Booker, a professional eater, right?  Yeah.  This is what I'm thinking.  I want to go to the videotape, if possible. 
[00:06:30]  I think Papamunaki actually has the brand new eggnog drinking record.  Why?  I went home Friday.  He lost.  But he slammed his whole shot.  Uh-huh.  Which would make 71 shots, 71 double shots of eggnog.  Before he puked.  And then he puked.  Eric still had time to get his shot down.  And how I saw it, but I want to see the video again, I think he only did half his shot. 
[00:07:00]  He started puking, because then I remember, after he puked, he finished his eggnog shot.  Okay.  All right.  I'm from the school of thought here, Opie, that it was whoever pukes first.  That's what I'm saying.  Now, in that 60 seconds that you have to finish your beverage, you could either slam it or  milk it.  Of course.  I think it doesn't depend, it wasn't who drinks the most to win that title, but are you saying  that he lost?  There's two different things here. 
[00:07:30]  He definitely lost the contest.  But he got the record.  But I think he may have the new record.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Because I remember that Eric definitely drank more of his shot after he started puking.  Right.  So, it comes down to, did Pat drink his entire shot before he started puking?  If he did, he's got the new record, officially.  Right.  At 71 double shots of eggnog.  Oh, the face transplant lady, sorry.  Yeah, this was a huge story over the weekend.  That's a real picture?  Yeah.  They finally have a real picture of face transplant lady.  Holy shit, they did a great job with that. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  It didn't look like Mr. Potato Head face or anything like that, where he just snapped it on?  The snap on nose?  He's got John Travolta's face.  Wait a minute.  Why?  From the movie.  That was a great joke.  Oh, that movie.  Face off?  Yeah, that was a good...  You know what?  You're too quick at that goddamn button.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was a movie that came out.  I would have started my appearance with that joke.  I would have liked...  First of all, you guys...  I would have went with some stronger material and then maybe worked something like that in. 
[00:08:30]  You guys...  No, it could only go up from there.  But you guys are sitting here in Boy Scout uniforms and you're criticizing my joke.  All right.  I thought it would go unmentioned, but is there a problem if radio guys want to come in and dress in Boy Scout uniforms?  This is very uncomfortable.  Like we have today?  It's very uncomfortable.  Look, everyone knows that Howard Stern invented everything.  Uh-huh.  And he invented wearing a Boy Scout uniform, so we figured it would help our careers if we came in here today in Boy Scout uniforms. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, but if you guys sell me cookies, you know I'm going to dodge you.  Everyone knows we don't do anything original.  Right.  We just wait for what he does and then we do it.  Those little scarves, too.  You guys went all out.  How come you have more badges than Anthony, though?  That's what I want to know.  Well, he works the board.  I work a lot harder.  He's an Eagle Scout.  He's got his volume knob metal.  I got my lesbian.  His badge.  You see my lesbian pin?  That's unbelievable.  Very nice, right?  I just want to go camping with you guys and get touched. 
[00:09:30]  Who doesn't?  You ass.  Holy crap.  Boy Scout uniforms with an AK-47 next to one.  Well, they have to be well armed.  We just want to jazz up our uniforms a little bit.  It's really awkward.  Fuck the Boy Scout uniforms.  Fucking faggot.  That's what I say.  Howard's a faggot.  He was wearing a Boy Scout uniform?  Well, we're at the beginning of the Howard Media Blitz, so he's going to be everywhere.  Yeah.  Yesterday, he came close to crying on 60 Minutes, and now I hear he's going to be in Newsweek 
[00:10:00]  or something, and they're showing a picture in the paper today of him in a Boy Scout uniform.  Obviously, we're not in Boy Scout uniforms.  No.  Your heroes would never wear Boy Scout uniforms.  That's silly.  And over the years, people have suggested that Anthony and I dress up in stuff.  Dress up in dresses and things of that nature.  We have been approached by photographers to do stupid things for the camera.  Right.  And they say, no, you don't understand. 
[00:10:30]  This is going to be a great idea.  And we say no.  Apparently, some people don't say no.  Right.  There was one article that they were doing last year when we came to XM Satellite Radio.  Yep.  And they wanted Anthony and I in an oversized T-shirt together.  Big T-shirt.  Both of us in it.  It would have been better just, can you two suck each other's cocks and we'll just snap away.  We'll snap away.  Management, management.  Isn't that awful? 
[00:11:00]  Management in any business has no clue.  None.  Right after last conversation, when my career couldn't have been any hotter, my manager calls  and says, VH1 is doing the best of the year.  Yeah.  Would you like to stand in Times Square handing out buttons and flyers?  Because I'm telling you, he goes, you can get $2,500 to hand out bracelets, buttons, and flyers.  Are you kidding?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  I just came off a TV show.  You want me to hand out flyers for only $2,500?  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Push the price up and you'd have been out there.  It's just, Matt, they have no clue.  Yeah.  Like, you guys are going to get dressed up in anything.  Well, they wanted us to do the oversized shirt and then they wanted us to dress as priests.  Priests and stand in front of St. Pat's and take a few snapshots of that.  There's only a feminine angle that came about that they wanted us to do.  There's always these costumes.  Just enough with the stupid fucking costumes.  You know, the Boy Scout uniform.  Oh.  And any type of costume.  Costumes are for one day a year. 
[00:12:00]  That's Halloween.  And I will join you on that day.  I won't even dress up for Halloween.  You're no fun.  Fuck that.  I'm wearing my Halloween pants, by the way, that Bonnie hated.  I didn't.  Bonnie didn't like those?  No.  Do you think there's people, like, there's people walking into Circuit City and different  places going, you know what?  Fucking Howard was in a Boy Scout uniform.  Let me sign up for Sirius.  I got it.  That's it.  That's what broke.  It's like these people that put these flags and...  When you start wearing, like, outfits like that in the press, you're just looking for 
[00:12:30]  attention.  Yeah.  You know, why don't you just let what you do speak for itself?  You don't need to wear a Boy Scout uniform.  He looks like such a faggot in this picture.  Yeah.  We got to get it up on our websites.  You see, he's starting to become the pathetic one.  Oh.  You know, through our careers, we've seen the pathetic one.  And it's a sad day when you become the pathetic one.  When you start wearing, you know, Boy Scout uniforms and stuff, you know, what are you 
[00:13:00]  doing?  Boy Scout uniforms.  What are you doing?  I saw it popped up on a few websites, the picture, and it was under one of the Photoshop  strings on the website, threads.  And everyone was saying, this has to be Photoshopped.  Like, it couldn't be real.  Like, they thought it was put there and somebody had already started fucking with it.  But no, it was from Newsweek, I guess.  And he's giving the...  Giving the Boy Scout salute.  I think it's more like the Girl Scout salute. 
[00:13:30]  Is that it?  Is it supposed to be, like, super ironic or something?  Yeah, I guess it's supposed to be that.  Like, Boy Scouts don't swear and...  Yeah, like he's really...  I don't know what he's going for!  It's the irony.  That was it.  Wait till he does his first, like, live remote or public, and he has eight listeners standing  out there.  Yeah.  That's when he throws himself out of the fucking window.  Well...  It's not going to be easy.  And a lot of the quotes look very, very familiar, by the way.  Yeah.  We went through this whole press junket about a year ago, a little more than a year  ago, and, wow, a lot of the quotes that are coming out in the Stern articles are very 
[00:14:00]  similar.  Hoo-hoo!  Very similar.  Because these dopey reporters will ask you about the shock jock angle.  You know, you guys are shock jocks, and we actually answer that question, you know,  perfectly.  Basically, if you go on the radio every day and just do shocking things, you're not going  to have an audience, and you would be off the radio, you know, I don't know, in a matter  of time, right?  And Howard has that exact quote today somewhere.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Very strange.  Yeah.  Well, have fun.  Congrats.  Let's go to Louie in New Jersey.  Louie!  Hey, man.  What's the story?  Hey, uh, that piece that he did on 60 Minutes last night, he's with Ed Bradley, they're running  around in, where is he, Bensonhurst is where he's from?  Uh, somewhere out in Long Island.  And they showed his house.  Yeah.  Is that fucking guy kidding me?  That's 20 times better than anything I ever fucking lived in.  He's got some fucking set of balls.  Unbelievable. 
[00:15:00]  The best part of 60 Minutes last night, because I watched, uh, he's talking about how he had  to go to school with all the black kids, and one black kid turned around and punched him  in the face.  I started laughing so hard.  And Bradley says to him, uh, what do you mean, he just stood up and punched you in the  face?  For what reason?  He says, well, you just, uh, well, I guess because I was white.  Get the fuck out of here.  Howard likes to think that he was the only one that was abused growing up.  We all were abused.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I wasn't.  You weren't?  Never?  No.  You were the popular kid in school?  I was super popular. 
[00:15:30]  In the group that was doing the abusing?  I grew up in Northern Canada.  There was four of us.  Oh, that's why.  You were isolated.  I'm going to have a wacky with a snowshoe.  I still don't know how it's a...  And the kid...  Who is that broad?  Uh, it's Bonnie.  Hey, who?  Who is that broad?  It's Bonnie Voss.  Oh, sorry.  It's Sarah!  Maybe I really shouldn't say that.  You married that fucking idiot.  Oh!  I should have, uh, yeah, said hi to our guest.  Are you Puerto Rican?  Who?  Yo. 
[00:16:00]  No, I'm a fucking guinea.  All right, relax.  Oh, I'm a fucking guinea.  Hey, you've got a problem with that.  And Howard probably got punched in class because he probably told the whole class that he invented  English.  He's full of shit.  I hate him.  All right, Louie.  Take it easy, brother.  Thank you.  Hasta.  But now he's getting closer and closer to crying and ugh.  He's taking himself too seriously.  You know, you put yourself out there, Robin.  Boo!  Boo! 
[00:16:30]  Turn around and punch me in the face.  Boo!  He was just trying to tell the class that he invented everything and he didn't even need  to be in school.  He invented black people.  My mother said we cannot run from black people.  But the problem was my mom stayed in the house all day and she sent me into Roosevelt  High School.  And I had a whole different experience.  I was a kid and I had to fend for myself.  I mean, I'd be sitting in a classroom and a guy would just turn around and bam, punch me  right in the face.  In the classroom?  In the classroom.  For what? 
[00:17:00]  For being white.  Or just for whatever.  For anger.  I mean, these kids were angry, man.  Howard, kids today are still angry.  Yeah.  Now they shoot you, Howard.  They shoot people.  Right.  All right.  And they didn't punch him as he was white because he was a half a Jew.  That's why they punched him, you dumb idiot.  Fuck, I grew up in an all-black neighborhood.  It was like, who...  Listen, if you can't get along, you know what I mean?  That means he's just a fucking nerd and a pussy.  I never got beat up.  I was raped once, but I was never beat up.  That was it, just...  And it's still, you know, not quite sure if it was a rape. 
[00:17:30]  We didn't have any, too.  You might have been asking for it.  In an all-black neighborhood, we used to go on these bus trips.  Can I tell you real quick?  Yeah.  So we went to Raleway Pool.  We're all going to go...  Oh, no.  All black people at Raleway Pool.  Like one of the public pools?  It was a public pool.  So we were going on a bus trip from our school, right?  I mean, from the block, from the block.  Holy shit.  So on the bus, everybody's going, I'm going to go off the high dive.  Everybody's going off the high dive, right?  So the day's going, everybody goes off the high dive except me and Reggie. 
[00:18:00]  Right?  I'm going, oh, please, God, don't let Reggie go, so I'm not the only one fucking tormented.  Right?  So next thing I look, and Reggie is flying off the high dive.  So it's only me or they're just going to fucking destroy me.  These are all black kids.  Faggot.  The whole thing.  Mm-hmm.  So I walk up onto the high dive, and I walk out, and I fucking go to turn around,  and these big black guys, I mean, they were fucking monsters.  They go, you better fucking jump.  And I get on the high dive, and the whole pool stops, just like hundreds of black people 
[00:18:30]  yelling, jump, jump, right?  And I fucking turn around and walk down, and that's why I am the way I am now.  You didn't go.  You fucking didn't go.  No, I didn't, but I finally...  They should have shanked you halfway down that ladder.  It was in Raleigh.  It was probably the most scary experience of my life.  I'm telling you.  And I didn't go off it.  Why would you go to Raleigh Pool?  Because it was where the block was going.  Was that like a field trip or something?  It was a block trip, and it's funny, because you couldn't even tell somebody shit in the 
[00:19:00]  pool that so many black people were in there.  See, now he's got to take it there.  Oh, Richard.  It was horrible.  You didn't get the reaction you were expecting, so you had to go there.  Now you had to take it to the next level.  Now you had to take it to the next level.  A very racist idea.  No, I'm just telling a regular story about black people, how of course you get punched.  Big deal.  It doesn't mean, you know...  All right.  Well, a Jew getting hassled by black people.  Yeah, you just...  You never see that.  And a Jew complaining about it. 
[00:19:30]  Why?  Is Roosevelt a tough town or something?  Long Island.  For Long Island, it was, you know, pretty...  Yeah, I guess.  Pretty bad.  Yeah.  If you grew up there as a white kid.  I don't know.  I was in Central Islip.  That was pretty bad when I was growing up.  It was pretty much the same thing, but, you know, I kind of stayed under the radar.  No one ever smashed me in the face, and it was a lot of black people in Central Islip.  That's for sure.  Did you not leave your house as a kid like you don't do now? 
[00:20:00]  No, I was out a lot as a kid, yeah.  I'm making up for it now.  I just sit down at my computer and do nothing.  Now he stays home all weekend and answers email and stuff.  Answers email.  He stays on MySpace like a lunatic, checking for new messages every two seconds.  Is somebody writing to me?  Someone want to be my friend?  Somebody want to pretend they're Opie?  Someone's going to be my friend today?  This kid really thinks he got me.  Good.  Well, the MySpace thing has taken off.  Norton's got 6,339 friends.  Anthony, you're falling a little behind. 
[00:20:30]  I haven't updated.  I haven't checked yet.  And Anthony has 5,426 friends.  And Jim Norton's and Anthony's MySpace accounts are on opiananthony.com.  And we're starting a propaganda war that's going back and forth.  Bulletins are going out to thousands of people that just badmouth each other.  And I don't know.  I don't see it helping.  I'm like the same distance behind Jimmy that I've always been.  Like everybody that's signing up to be my pal is also signing up to be Jimmy's pal. 
[00:21:00]  No loyalty.  No loyalty at all.  Well, you know, I was getting all kinds of friends when you had me in your top eight.  And as of last night, the military took over.  Well, I decided.  I decided why should I be like Jimmy Norton and put trannies and people begging to be  on the top eight and then they'll put him on the top eight and make deals like that.  I figured I am putting our servicemen on my top eight so I could give tribute to the people 
[00:21:30]  that are risking their lives and not be a terrorist lover like Jimmy and a smut peddler.  So I put all of the guys.  Yes, I am putting Howard in his Boy Scout uniform up there.  Oh, you got to.  Because that's a branch of the military.  You got to.  That's what you got to do for your top eight.  All military guys and Howie in his Boy Scout uniform.  And Howie.  Who told him that would be a good idea?  And someone's getting pissed at us that we're talking about. 
[00:22:00]  You got to talk about Howard in a Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  You can't let that one go ever.  All right.  So I can't seem to get more friends.  I can't seem to get any more than Jimmy.  Jimmy's doing a great job.  Jimmy schmoozes.  He puts dirty broads up there and people go to see the pictures of the filthy whores he has up there.  He puts trannies up.  I could say that.  It's something for everybody.  You know how to put all that shit on there and do all that crap?  Yeah.  And he's been building websites since like 88. 
[00:22:30]  When before they even had a worldwide web, I had a site.  I was just waiting for the web to be invented.  That's right.  I love that trannies are sitting around just getting on to my space.  Yeah.  Be my friend.  They really change.  Be my friend, Daddy.  And they try to pull it off being like, looking like a girl.  And, you know, some of the pictures are taken in the most subdued lighting ever.  Like, oh, here's Brandy. 
[00:23:00]  Hi, I'm Brandy.  And you see the picture of Brandy and it's like a half shot where the lighting is only one half of the face.  And that's really dim.  So you only see like maybe the whites of the eye.  And you go to the site and punch up some more pictures.  And you're just like, oh, Jesus.  Oof.  That definitely has a cock.  These guys, these comics I talk to, they go, yeah, I'm meeting this girl from MySpace.  And, you know, then you see them.  Oh, she was a pig.  You got to have a picture taken.  The girl has to send a picture with a newspaper with the date.  Oh, you want a, like, hostage picture? 
[00:23:30]  Well, yeah, because, you know what?  You don't know.  If she sent one, you know, before she had that fucking, you know, buffet attack and she's 300 pounds, you know, they're a mess.  This kid that got me, you know, he said he was Opie.  So I emailed him.  He goes.  On his front page, it says Opie.  But it says, I am holding this page for the real Opie.  I don't read any of that shit.  I look at the picture.  First of all, you sent me yours.  Same way he feels about the newspaper.  Yeah, exactly.  You sent me yours.  I'm going, okay, I can see Anthony on MySpace.  All right.  But then Opie sent me. 
[00:24:00]  It's Opie.  I'm going, okay.  I can't see Opie doing this shit.  But I didn't read anything.  So I write back.  How come I'm not in your top eight?  He writes back, well, whatever, I'm not in your top eight.  So I put him.  Then he says something like, while you're on MySpace, work on your comedy.  I go, I don't need to.  He writes back.  So then he says, when do you want to come in again?  So I said, how about next week?  Now he's baiting you.  So he says.  This is the fake Opie, right?  This is the fake Opie.  So he says, when do you want to come in? 
[00:24:30]  I go, next week, Monday or Tuesday.  He goes, well, how about tomorrow?  So I go, all right.  And I'm going, oh, fuck.  I don't want to come in tomorrow.  But, you know, okay.  So up to there, he had me.  But then I called Ben.  Of course I'm going to call and confirm.  So I called Ben.  I go, what time does Opie want me in?  And Ben's going, what the fuck are you talking about?  We're on the train.  He got you.  Okay.  No, no.  He just got you.  He made you call Ben to confirm when you're coming in.  But no, me coming in would have gotten me.  No, you even calling Ben. 
[00:25:00]  You thought it was Opie, and you thought you were supposed to come in.  You called Ben not to say, did Opie really say for me to come in?  You said, Opie told me to come in.  No.  He got you.  That's it.  Do you think that's getting me?  Absolutely.  Even worse, I'm going to use a word in a sentence.  No.  As in, no, I didn't read any of it.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  So I spelled.  How do you spell no?  No.  Why did you spell it K-N-O-W?  Because it was probably.  No, I didn't read any of it.  Okay.  An actual post from Rich Voss. 
[00:25:30]  Okay.  So you make one mistake here and there with grammar.  It's not a big deal or spelling.  Okay.  I got a lot of shit on my mind.  It's not there and there.  It's no.  No.  Everyone knows the no rule.  The there rule gets a little confusing at times.  I really am trying to think of a way to get you out of this, Rich.  I can't.  No is just no.  You don't sit there and go, wow, is it N-O or K-N-O?  Yeah.  Can I just say, he loves to type.  So he'll always pick the word with more letters.  Throwing in a little extra letters if he has to. 
[00:26:00]  It was a clear mistake.  Hey, backing up a little bit.  The eggnog drinking contest, are the videos up yet?  I do believe on boundary.  Were they up?  No.  Wow.  Why aren't they up yet?  Why the delay?  We need puking videos.  I know Steve was busy making sure he didn't get shot down from a tree this weekend.  I might puke.  Bonnie, rip the headphones off every time I play one of those.  Well, because I can feel it in my stomach, actually.  You certainly can. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  Something about puking is just always funny.  It is really hysterically funny.  It's always funny.  It's so disgusting, but so funny.  Get Steve in here.  I laugh like a retard.  The pictures from the eggnog drinking contest are up, but we want the video of the guys puking.  Hey, Steve.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  How are you?  Very good.  There it is.  Tough weekend for you, I heard.  Oh, yeah.  Bear season in Jersey.  Well, he got a deal. 
[00:27:00]  When he goes out, they just start shooting at him.  I know.  The hardest thing.  And then I saw they love calling you up when you come into the studio.  I'm not reacting this time.  I just hear them buzzing, and I know it's them.  I saw one picture, one video of you over the weekend where they were actually taking  you down from a tree with a big cable hook from a tow truck.  That was a little painful.  Lowering you down.  I think you want to furry, Steve.  I just wanted some privacy.  You go up in a tree, you get shot in the ass with a dart, and they take you down on a  cable.  Is this bear hunting only happening in Jersey, as far as the East Coast goes? 
[00:27:30]  No, I'm sure down South.  Oh, you got a phone call, Steve?  And who knew there were so many bears in Jersey?  Yeah.  That seems to be the problem.  I never saw a fucking bear in Jersey.  How many did they get?  Very strict limit on how many they can get.  Well, the bear population is growing in Jersey, and bears are starting to end up in people's  backyards, and knocking down mailboxes, driving through people's backyards, and they have  to call the, what do they call them?  Is it a herd of bear? 
[00:28:00]  A pack of bear?  A pack, I think.  I don't know.  I think it's a pod.  A pod?  A pod of bear.  And the hunters do that.  They go out, but then you get the animal rights groups that say it's cruel.  No, you know what, though?  Yeah.  The bear love it.  The bear really enjoy it?  They do.  Is that it?  That's one thing animal rights activists don't want you to know.  I don't think the hunters are actually saying the bears like it, either.  I think any hunter would say, the bear probably doesn't like it at all.  No, the bear enjoys itself.  Yeah? 
[00:28:30]  Very much.  The one thing that I think is disgusting, I would never eat my kill.  That's gross.  Just kill it and let it rot.  I'll just leave it there.  I'm a vegan.  I'm a vegan.  And don't mistake the bear for what Norton has on his MySpace, gay bears.  It's the two different type of bears, right?  Gay bears?  You don't know what gay bears are?  Those big, like Steve.  We were at a convention.  We were at a club, and they were having a gay bear convention in our hotel.  Oh, wonderful.  There was like 500 Steves walking around the hotel.  Where was this?  It was a hotel.  We were in North Carolina working at a club, Charlie Goodnights, and at the hotel we were 
[00:29:00]  staying, they were having a gay bear convention.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  What happens at a gay bear convention?  I guess they have gay bear, like, uh...  There was a lot of hot tubbing.  It was...  They were all coming in and out of...  The pool.  It was just...  Oh, my God.  I feel sorry for the filter.  I know.  It was all right.  Oh.  They would just get in the elevator and be so awkward.  They'd be like, oh, what are the bears?  What are the bears?  Did you take pictures? 
[00:29:30]  You went to a gay bear convention?  No, we didn't...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We didn't go.  Well, you were in the same hotel.  Yeah, we were in the same hotel.  You're rubbing elbows with the gay bears.  Yeah.  We didn't lay by the pool with them.  I'm sure you had a buffet with them somewhere.  The gay bears.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You saw them all around the pool and stuff?  Oh, it was horrible.  Yeah, they were everywhere.  All hairy and fat.  Hairy looked like just a bunch of inner tubes laying around.  Hairy and happy.  That's what they were.  Yeah.  Every now and then, one or two of them had a little young skinny boy.  You know?  Ooh.  You don't know if he was a hostage or what. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  That's really funny.  Fat stomachs hanging over this boy's back.  You know?  Gay bear convention.  Who knew?  Just hair and cum through the filter.  That's just...  Oh.  Oh.  But what gay guy has that?  You know, don't gay guys usually enjoy good-looking gay guys?  Why are you fucking looking at me like that?  Yeah, she's just totally directing this question to Rich.  Because I...  My husband's a little light in the loafers. 
[00:30:30]  And...  You've heard about your experiences.  None.  I'm starting to try to, like, catch him.  Like, I think, like, when he goes to take out the garbage, you know, there's something  going on.  Because he'll go out at, like, three in the morning.  He'll get out of bed and be like...  To take out the garbage?  He'll take a phone call.  And then he'll be like, I gotta take out the garbage.  All right.  There's absolutely something going on.  What is rich?  What the fuck are you doing?  It's weird.  You are absolutely doing...  He is absolutely up to something. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, he's...  No one takes a phone call at that hour and goes, I gotta take out the garbage.  In the car.  Yeah.  I'm taking it right to the dump.  Those garbage men work hard enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, he goes, right.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  She just...  She thinks she's gonna catch me with some gay liaison or something.  I've seen him talk to men where I think there's a bit of a gay vibe going on.  There's something going on?  Yeah.  No, maybe with them, not with me.  Wow.  You know? 
[00:31:30]  Like when there's a guy that you...  You're both too into it.  Well, there's a guy that you know is gay.  Well, him and Dice one time were having a conversation that was so gay.  Oh, that was Dice gay?  I mean, I couldn't hear what they were saying, but...  But that's just Dice.  Yeah.  Dice is just a weird old man.  I thought they were gonna make out.  Hey, Rich, so you, when you was fucking me, I understand I wasn't good for you.  I didn't feel good because I want to please my man.  I want to please my man.  Oh!  Hey, Dice, I hear you just got back from the gay bear convention. 
[00:32:00]  What was that?  I was at the gay bear convention.  Yeah.  It was good.  We went swimming and then we snuggled under an umbrella so we don't get burned.  It was lovely.  I went up the ladder to do the high dive, but I turned around.  I'm a faggot.  You snuggled and ate a lot of comfort food, I heard.  Comfort food?  Of course, when you miss out on the love as a child, yeah, you gotta eat to make up for  the love.  Or you can take the love of another man. 
[00:32:30]  Oh!  How was the hot tub at the gay bear convention?  Thick!  That's thick and creamy.  It's like swimming in New England clam chowder.  With hair.  Oh!  The gay bear convention.  Gay bear convention.  I'm going to say that all day long. 
[00:33:00]  But now, weren't you at that hotel?  I mean, I was there with you the last time, but you said you were there.  The year before.  The year before.  I worked the exact week.  The exact...  The year before.  He knew they were coming.  Oh, you knew they were coming.  No, no, no.  Let me tell you what happened.  Can I just say this?  A lot of them were like, hey, Rich, good to see you.  Oh!  He's like, they recognize me.  They have my DVD.  Which, yeah, it's not true.  No, the year before I was there, too.  Take hands to the last comic standing.  Yeah, yeah.  Last comic kneeling.  Can I tell you, he lied to me one time. 
[00:33:30]  Who was that guy?  Oh, Tucker Carlson?  Tucker Carlson was at the airport, and he wanted to go say hi to him.  Was he the bow tie guy?  Yeah, the bow tie guy.  And so, after Rich had his...  I wouldn't go meet him, but after Rich had his interaction with him, Rich goes, yeah, he recognized me.  But I, when I walked by, I heard Rich go, Rich was from last comic stand.  Oh, no.  So, that's not being recognized?  No, Rich completely lied to me.  It's not being recognized if you say who you are. 
[00:34:00]  Like, the guy might have been like, oh, okay, Rich, okay, good.  No, he said he, from Tough Crowd, he watched Tough Crowd.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Getting back to Steve.  You lied.  Are we getting video up of the eggnog drinking content?  Yeah, I talked to Chris Hummercash yesterday evening, and he's still editing it.  It should be up in both PC form and iPod form by the end of the show.  iPod form.  Look at that.  That's what we're talking about, the future.  The future of this show. 
[00:34:30]  iPods, things like that.  You got an iPod?  Yeah.  Speaking of iPods, where's Ridge Voss right now?  What am I on, Dave?  Oh, he's on iTunes.  iTunes.  Yeah, I have an iPod.  You can download.  What are you going cricket?  I'm on iTunes.  You were looking for a huge reaction.  Okay, you're on iTunes.  That's pretty fucking cool, isn't it?  Are you going to download it onto your VHS videotape?  What do you got on iTunes?  Like, some of your acts?  No, from my album.  Yeah, my CD.  Yeah, that's cool.  On iTunes.  Yeah, but my iPod, that thing.  Welcome to the year 2003. 
[00:35:00]  2003.  Yeah.  You're like the last person to do that.  What, to download everything?  Yeah.  That's great, man.  I'm just up all night.  We're on Audible.com.  Audible.  What's that?  All our shows are available on Audible.com.  And you can download them?  Like, this show will be available later today on Audible.com.  Yeah.  We haven't seen a piece of the action yet.  And I keep calling Bob to find out what the hell's going on with Audible.com, and he still  hasn't told me what's going on.  Well, maybe if you guys would wear a big t-shirt, you'd see part of the action.  I ain't wearing a big t-shirt or priest outfits or any of that shit. 
[00:35:30]  Boy Scout uniform.  Someone has an explanation for the gay bears.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  The gay bears, it's like a, I'm a part of it somewhat.  It's like a, it's a subculture.  Wait, why are you part of it somewhat?  Well, I don't dabble in it.  I don't travel.  These guys travel all over the world.  They go down to North Carolina.  They have these bear conventions, and they're all over the world. 
[00:36:00]  They have them in Amsterdam, and these guys travel all over the world to go and just basically  meet and go and have sex and whatever, and it's just hundreds of them.  What are some of the activities?  Yeah, what are the activities at the gay bear convention?  Eating, a lot of banquets and swimming, because there's a lot of admirers, skinny guys, I like  guys, big bearish guys, chubby guys.  That's the black guys that like the white, fat bears, right?  The black guys. 
[00:36:30]  No, there's a lot of, a lot of, a lot of white guys like them, too.  Big, fat, I'm a, I'm a really big guy.  I go hunting and everything, and I'm as clear as a $3 bill.  It's a whole acceptance thing, I think.  Yeah, but, and the skinny guys are attracted to the fact that, like, want to be, like,  are they, like, bottoms and tops and shit like that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that's usually the first question.  What are you, bottom, top, versus?  Oh, that's, that's like a cocktail hour question.  Before the full?  Oh, nice to meet you, darling.  You're a bottom?  That's an icebreaker.  That's the icebreaker. 
[00:37:00]  You want to know first what they are.  What if, here's a gay question.  If you're a bottom or top, right?  You know, when you say, what are you, a bottom or a top, right?  Yeah.  What if a guy says, nah, I just like oral.  What happens?  Is he getting shunned at the convention?  No, no, no.  There's a top and bottom oral.  The bottom is the guy that likes to give it, and top is the guy that likes to receive it.  Yeah, but that's, I'm talking about oral, just mountain, like, you don't want your ass  touched or touching ass.  Are you allowed still to go to the convention?  I just want to know for next year. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, there you go.  Rich is just trying to figure out how gay he really is.  Wouldn't this make a great gay romantic comedy, like, a bottom meets another bottom and falls  in love, but they can't ever be together.  Someone's got to take the initiative.  All right, Paul, thanks.  All right, take care.  Both there on the bed on their knees, asses up, just waiting.  Come on.  This is never going to try it.  All right, Steve, so the videos will be up later today or tomorrow. 
[00:38:00]  Great.  For the eggnog drinking contest.  Why don't we take our first break?  Right.  We've got Rich and Bonnie in today, and we've got lots to do.  I'm Sarah.  And Sarah Silverman is here as well.  My vagina's itchy.  I was going down here the other night doing ventriloquism.  You ever do that when you're down here?  Pretend you're, like, doing, talking without moving my mouth?  I know what it is.  I'm kidding.  Yeah, that was the problem.  You weren't moving your mouth.  Ah.  Ah.  Fine. 
[00:38:30]  A cock.  Doing Otto and George impressions down there.  What would that do?  Why would you be a ventriloquist to her?  It's fucking hilarious.  How could it be hilarious?  Because the whole thing with that act is the guy's lips don't move, right?  Yes, exactly.  You're right.  But when you're doing it to her, you can't see the lips.  So he's basically just down there going like this.  No.  No, no, no.  Smiling, smiling.  It's using your tongue and doing it at the same time.  That's almost, it's like.  And talking?  Yeah.  What would you say? 
[00:39:00]  I'd be like, hey, yeah.  You know, whatever.  I would just, you know.  I'm not here.  I don't want this disgust.  It's just, you know, you're just trying to spice up the sex life.  Were you really laughing?  I was laughing and trying to get him away from me because it was.  Laughing at him.  Well, did we talk about this last time?  I don't know.  That's so disgusting.  I don't know if we talked about it last time.  What?  I feel like fucking Stiller and Mira, what?  He went to go down on me.  He farted when he was going. 
[00:39:30]  And I said, I can't do it.  I can't do it.  That really ruins the mood.  And he goes, it doesn't matter if I fart, it's if you fart, we have to stop.  No, it's pretty much whatever she says.  Yeah.  If you've ruined the mood with some gas.  A fart just ruins the mood.  It was horrible.  You could be making a multi-million dollar deal and if someone farts, the deal's ruined.  Yeah, a deal breaker.  It's a deal breaker no matter what you do.  I got to get my brain into a certain place, you know. 
[00:40:00]  Then she says later, she goes, can you go downstairs and turn on the heat and the gas?  But I don't think, if I was a girl and some guy's going down on me, I just want to fucking  shoot my, you know.  Yeah, because you're not a girl.  You don't ruin the mood.  It's more mental.  Yeah.  With the girls.  I got to think of certain people and stuff.  All right.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  When we get back, I guess we got to talk about movies?  Yes.  Do our movie break.  Worst movie ever.  Anthony saw a movie?  Worst movie ever?  Yeah.  I saw the best movie ever over the weekend. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, good for you.  Bad for me.  There's a tease.  I love the Harry Potter movies.  Oh, you saw the Harry Potter?  No, I did not.  What?  Yeah, they're fucking great.  They actually are really good movies.  Little Emma Watson's looking very hot.  What is she now, 14?  She's got a little nubs.  Yeah.  She's working on the little nubs at this point.  Cute girl.  All right, quick break and we'll continue.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  F***. 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say f***.  F***.  F***.  Oh, it's the O.B. 
[00:41:30]  This is the O.B. and Anthony Programme on XM Satellite Radio.  The pioneers of satellite radio. 
[00:42:00]  That's right.  We've been at this for about a year and three months now.  It's getting more gooder every day.  Someone suggested we should dress up like pioneers.  Get in front of a Conestoga wagon.  Yeah, we'll dress like pilgrims.  Yeah.  We'll do a photo shoot and we'll dress as pilgrims.  Because we need all the attention we can get.  We are the first.  It's been great and it's getting better every day.  Unbelievable.  I guess there's going to be like a four-story billboard they're going to be hanging from  Madison Square Garden for us soon. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, the word's out.  Within a day or two, I believe.  Really?  A day or two?  One of the shots from our photo shoot they're making into a four-story billboard.  For real?  Yeah.  Where are they putting it?  Madison Square Garden.  Get out of here.  For real?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  Wow.  Look for that.  We've come a long way.  Four-story billboard.  Yeah.  How f***ing cool is that?  See?  Very.  See, we're back, Rich.  I don't need you anymore.  I don't need to cry on your shoulder anymore.  I know.  Hey, listen.  Who always supported you guys?  When I was on the road for two years, always brought up your guys' names. 
[00:43:00]  Without any question.  Those guys, Opie and Anthony, were assholes.  Always brought up the name, though.  I'm telling you.  He always plugs you guys on the road.  Yeah.  On the road.  Clubs.  A lot of O&A guys are coming out, man.  They're f***ing great comedy supporters.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to try to start an Opie and Anthony comedy tour soon.  That just roams the country endlessly.  I mean, there's f***ing idiots that, you know, on message boards that go, come to a comedy  show and see.  All right?  Voss? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  You get guys that.  Not from the comedy show.  Once they come to the shows, they were doing a sticker stop this week in Miami at the improv.  You know, they come down with the stickers.  They did it in San Francisco.  Voss.  What?  Did I try to?  I wasn't plugging.  You're dealing with pros.  If you want to plug your gig, just plug it.  Just plug it.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  Don't try to work it into the conversation.  Oh, listen.  Do you think, listen.  No one else does.  Was he working it into the conversation body?  I think he was actually trying to say to people who say he sucks that he doesn't.  No, no.  I don't care about that.  And I will prove that I don't suck when I appear at the improv in Miami. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, Jesus.  Just fucking plug the gig.  I'm not plugging it.  We're friends.  Just do it.  I'm just saying how the supporters come out.  And it's a fucking, it's a fun night, man.  And where would you like to support us to show up?  No, I don't care if they come to the improv or Caroline's the 20th, the week of the 20th.  But listen, here's the thing.  There's some guys that will keep coming to the shows.  Like, there's one guy.  He's been at like eight in a row.  He went to see Norton. 
[00:44:30]  He drove four hours and Norton canceled the gig up in a college.  Is that the guy that has all your shows, the O&A shows on tape and cataloged?  Who does?  I don't know.  I forget the guy's name.  He does t-shirts and he drove up for four hours to see him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're starting to notice the super fans.  Yeah.  Like, we've always had fans, which is cool.  But now it's getting to the point where you got the uber super fans and they show up at 
[00:45:00]  the gigs and stuff.  They're like stalkers.  And they have like pictures of us they took like five, six years ago in plastic.  And they carefully pull it out.  Yeah, like a Superman number one.  Yeah.  And then they have a special marker that you could use.  Even though we have Sharpies like, oh, no, no, no.  They got some like $50 pen they bought.  And then they like don't want you to touch the picture with the palm of your hand as  you're signing the thing.  And then as soon as you sign it, they grab it and carefully throw it back in the plastic.  And then they just run away.  And then their mom's dead in their rocking chair in their attic. 
[00:45:30]  Look what I got, mommy.  Finally.  Or some of these guys will have like the same picture, but they have Anthony's autograph,  but they don't have mine or whatever.  So now it has to match up like they got the autograph the same day.  So they got the exact pen that Anthony used like three years ago.  It's like in a case in their fucking basement.  Unbelievable.  A freak show.  And then they need their pictures taken a certain way.  But there are, you can spot nine out of ten times. 
[00:46:00]  In general, our fans are unbelievable.  I'm talking about a very, very tiny niche.  There's maybe ten of them out there.  You could spot some ONA fans, though, in the audience.  Like you could look at, go ONA.  Just no.  Well, because they have their shirts on.  The girls are showing their boobs.  And, like, I'm pals now with Kid...  Not pals.  I mean, we don't hang out.  But Kid Africa comes to the shows.  Wow.  You two had quite a little rivalry going.  Once I get this guy, Chester Liver, to come out and turn him around,  then I have nobody left to fight with on the message boards. 
[00:46:30]  Kid Africa came to my HBO taping then.  Oh.  What a great guy.  I don't know how he did, because there's really no trees leading up to that building.  Oh.  Richard.  Always got a just tape.  The message boards have gotten better, by the way.  What's that?  They become more like fans, you know, fansites.  No, but the real fans do come out.  There was a time that these, quote, fansites were...  They didn't look like fansites.  They do come out, though.  They do support.  Oh, no.  They're unbelievable supporters.  Yeah.  All right, let's get into some movie talk, because just before the show, 
[00:47:00]  Anthony said he went and saw a movie this weekend.  I didn't go and see it.  I don't go to the movies.  Oh, it's on DVD already?  No, it's on a hotel.  Oh, okay.  You go to the hotel, and you get the new...  On demand and all that.  Oh, okay.  I gotcha.  I gotcha.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was one of the worst movies I ever saw.  The Constant Gardener.  Why would you rank?  You know, when we were in Washington...  Yeah.  The Constant Gardener was one of the choices...  Yeah.  ...at our fine hotel there, and we chose that dog movie, that chick flick. 
[00:47:30]  Which, oh, no, see?  What dog movie?  You're just as guilty.  Uh, I don't know.  I ended up falling asleep.  It was all right until I fell asleep.  Oh, must love dog.  Must love dog.  Must love dog.  But I picked that over to the Constant Gardener, thinking, you know, this has got to be better  than the Constant Gardener.  Yeah.  It was, uh...  Well, from the trailer, it looked like a mystery.  It's kind of a murder mystery.  But it turned out to be like, I don't know.  I can't even describe it. 
[00:48:00]  The guy's wife gets killed in Africa.  That's all I know.  Well, they're in Africa.  Ray Fines is in it.  It's all shot with a handheld...  Handheld shaky cam, so you're nauseous by the end of the movie.  You know, they're trying to pull this thing off, you know, get this human interest story  that, hey, they're testing drugs in Africa.  Yeah, that was the story.  Let's go after the drug companies.  Yeah.  First of all...  Rich.  Oh, my God.  First of all...  Just let him go.  First of all...  First of all...  First of all...  Okay.  Of course they're going to test drugs in Africa. 
[00:48:30]  Where else are you going to fucking test drugs?  Okay.  Second of all...  For all the diseases.  Are you going to go after the drug companies?  Oh, my.  Is one guy or two guys doing, you know, some research going to be able to take down the  drug companies?  No.  All the money they have, they could have anybody off like that.  That's what I'm saying.  This explanation of it is worse than watching the movie.  Of course.  No, Woody.  I'm trying to...  It was so bad.  It was just so bad.  Well, but you're not explaining to the people, the lovely listeners, what the movie's about.  I just don't see it.  That's all I can say. 
[00:49:00]  Because I don't know what it was about.  It was about...  You have to see Rachel Weisz naked in the bathtub.  Yeah.  Really?  With a fake pregnant belly on her.  I couldn't figure out how they did it.  It was like prosthetics.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But naked.  They put like a fake belly on her.  She was pregnant.  It was horrible.  But the movie...  Why did he wait at the end to sit there to just get killed?  Because he knew they were going to kill him.  By the way, that was the end of the movie.  That was...  I still had no idea...  Spoiler alert!  I still had no idea what the movie's about.  Spoiler, by the way.  What it was about was this young lady... 
[00:49:30]  An activist.  ...was a drug activist doing research on why they were testing African kids with these  drugs.  Giving them drugs.  Giving them drugs.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it killed them.  Yeah.  And sometimes it killed them.  And they were covering it up.  And the government was involved in it because there was a lot of money to be made.  You saw this movie?  Yeah, we saw it in...  We went...  What did we see?  We didn't go to the theater.  We went to the theater.  We went to the theater.  Oh, we went to the theater.  We were in the theater the other night and some guy almost started a fight with me because 
[00:50:00]  I was smoking in the theater.  Well, what year is this?  You don't want to smoke in the theater.  But I'm in the back.  Are you saying Gone with the Wind?  I'm here.  I was in the back.  That was a wonderful motion picture.  I'm glad for this intermission.  When I smoked, I smoked in the movie.  Everybody does this.  You don't anymore.  But you're not allowed to anymore.  Well, you're not allowed to do a lot of things, but you do them anyway.  You light up, take a couple of drags?  Yeah, you put it out.  Oh, no, you don't.  Listen, if it was...  Whatever.  You're not supposed to use your cell phone in the movie theater either, but a lot of  people do it. 
[00:50:30]  Black people, you're not supposed to talk in the theater, but they do.  Well, you tell them to knock it off.  Would you...  You know, it's so funny...  No, I've talked about the movie theater stuff.  I don't say boo.  Okay, here's the thing.  I would say boo.  No, boo.  That might not be a good one.  Boo gashat.  I don't say shit.  I thought the movie that you saw, I understood.  I didn't think it was great, but I understood what was going on, Connor.  Wow.  Boss understood it.  I didn't.  I understood the movie.  Why did you go see Walk the Line?  Because it wasn't in the hotel. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, that's why.  That movie's going to get...  I heard that, Johnny Cash, yeah.  It's going to get all sorts of Oscars.  Awards.  Did you see it?  Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash.  Yeah, I did.  It was great.  I didn't know Johnny Cash had a hair lip.  I was just confused.  Yeah, that hair lip, though, man.  It gives him the Johnny Cash snarl.  It's very disturbing to look at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially in this movie, it's very, very obvious the hair lip.  Is it?  Yeah.  But he sounds a lot like Johnny Cash.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Doesn't look like him whatsoever.  No.  But the movie was excellent.  And he sang all the Johnny Cash songs in the movie. 
[00:51:30]  Himself, he can sing?  Well, I've seen a lot of interviews with Joaquin Phoenix, and they say that he wasn't a singer  before this movie.  Really?  Yeah.  Just out of nowhere.  And then he picked it up with a vocal coach, and he pulled it off.  Does he do a good impression?  He can make anyone sound like any person.  Is it a good impression?  He did a great impression of Johnny Cash in the movie Walked Alone.  Wow.  Certainly, yeah.  Why don't they get the guys that don't look like him?  Why don't they get somebody that looks like him?  There's a 10 billion actor.  Those movies suck when they get somebody that kind of looks like him.  Yeah, because you're constantly like... 
[00:52:00]  They just kind of got somebody that looks like him, that can't act.  It's better to have a good actor, I think.  Right.  We saw Ice Harvest over the week.  What is that?  It was with Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack.  Cusack, or whatever.  Cusack.  That's how it's pronounced in some countries.  Cusack.  Yeah.  Before they came to America, it was Cusack.  Cusack.  They Americanized it.  I think I love him.  He's a great actor.  I mean, he plays the same character in a lot of movies. 
[00:52:30]  He was in that Must Love Dogs.  Oh, was he?  Horrible.  Yeah, the Must Love Dogs movie.  The guy's had a career for like 30 fucking years.  Wait, but you watched Much Love Dog with your girlfriend or something?  Yeah, when we were in D.C.  Did you cry?  I fell asleep, to be honest with you.  I actually know what I was doing.  I was playing my PSP.  PSP?  That's the greatest invention ever.  What's that?  Well, because, you know...  Oh, my God.  Instead of turning your TV into video gaming, you could play a video game. 
[00:53:00]  While someone else is watching.  And while someone else is watching TV.  So you could take a peek at, like, yesterday I was watching all the football games and playing  PSP at the same time.  Sweet.  Definitely sweet.  Definitely sweet.  I almost, on the plane, almost shed a couple tears when I watched that movie with, what  was the lady's name?  Heather Lockley?  What's her name, the movie?  Oh, God.  And Heather Learjet.  Heather Lockley and the girl.  The Perfect Man.  The Perfect Man.  There were some sad parts of it.  So what's Ice Harvest about? 
[00:53:30]  It's the same old hack premise.  What?  I don't even really know what it's about, and I think I'm kind of semi-intelligent.  But it was like, you know, a lot of stuff didn't add up.  Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack.  Cusack?  I think that's how you pronounce it.  John Cusack.  John Cusack.  John Cusack.  Doc's brother.  John Cusack.  They stole some money from their boss, I think.  The mob.  The mob.  And then, you know, they had to figure out a way to, like, get out of it, and the chick, 
[00:54:00]  spoiler alert, is, you know.  Kind of who she's going to go with?  She ends up, she's going to kill them both, you know.  Oh, I thought it was a romantic thing.  Well, one, she's, you know, there's...  It's a strip club atmosphere.  There's stuff that just doesn't, I don't know what's going on.  Had the mob been robbed, you know, and, you know, the accountant or lawyer takes the  money, and they just fucking end up, you know, going after him.  And it gets four out of five stars in some, I don't know, in something she read. 
[00:54:30]  Platt.  What's that guy's name?  Platt.  Oh, he's good.  He's good after Oliver Platt.  Oliver Platt.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he's good.  He's the only good one in it, you know.  He's comic relief.  He's really drunk the entire time.  So what we're saying is there are real shit movies out there right now.  I was just about to say that, yeah.  It's also...  Thank God Kong is coming out.  Yes.  Because there's been a major dry spell.  I mean, Harry Potter, obviously, there's a huge movie doing crazy business.  Do you enjoy the Harry Potter movies?  I think a lot of adults enjoy the Harry Potter movies, especially because they're getting  darker. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, the first one.  And I hear this one's even darker than the last one.  Oh, the first one was just for the kids, but ever since they've been getting darker and  darker.  And Alan Rickman's a great actor, too.  He's fantastic.  He's an actor.  Hans Gruber.  I just can't wait for Kong.  Kong's going to turn around this dry spell, obviously.  Yes, Peter Jackson, another huge, massive hit.  Isn't he sitting in the rest of the week?  I'm hoping.  Oh, Jesus.  You know what?  I was thinking something else.  But yes, someone that... 
[00:55:30]  At first, I thought Peter Jackson's going to be here, and I'm trying to find out where  the Peter Jackson joke was, and then I realized.  Actually, Patricia O'Neill will be here starting tomorrow.  They put one out of 50 good movies out, you know, and it's just...  Because you know what it's got to be to make money?  It's got to be a movie that you're going to take your kids to see, because that's what  makes all the money.  But the adults can be entertained, too.  Yeah, but how are you going to connect both?  Wait, you don't think...  Shrek?  How?  They do it all the time.  Well, with the kids...  Like Shrek, yes.  Yes.  The Harry Potter movies are doing that. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, yeah, they're doing great.  With the fish, you know.  War of the Rings.  We're huge.  Did you see War of the Worlds?  Stunk.  No.  Terrible.  Stunk.  Terrible.  But it was a huge hit for Tom Cruise.  Why did the kid...  They made $200 million.  There's a bunch of why-dids in that movie.  The kid went off on his own and got home before Tom Cruise did.  Yeah, I thought he was dead, too, when he ran into that, you know, all the...  Whatever.  Up the hill and the explosions.  Kill him off.  How did he end up home before?  How did he get back to Boston before?  He hitched a ride on one of those spaceships. 
[00:56:30]  He should have just looked at Tom and said, I told you so.  Right at the end of the movie.  Faggot.  All right.  Oh, you know what?  We're going to have to do your...  Fucking bullshit.  We're going to have to do your 1990 stand-up in a little while.  Was that 1990?  I'm going to have to leave.  With a VHS tape.  I thought you were going to save that for, like, when Patrice or Norton's in the slam  it.  That's from 1990?  Yeah, we'll play it again then.  I've got to have dental work.  My whole bridge is...  It's all temporary.  Want to see?  Oh, no.  Stop.  Did it come out?  Rich, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:00]  Holy shit.  Can we get a picture of that?  Uh-uh.  Wow.  That's half your friggin' teeth just came out of your head.  That's not going on.  That's from back in high school when a black dude punched you in the face.  What?  What happened?  I've got to get thousands of dollars a bunch of work.  Wait, just to explain, Vos just pulled out, what, four?  What happened?  Four or five of his top teeth.  Starting with one of the big chiclets in front and working his way to the back.  First of all, I had three, a bridge with three teeth. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Right here, the top, the first one, then the next two was a bridge.  Mm-hmm.  But on the third tooth, the tooth under it decayed.  So now there was nothing holding the bridge, so they had to pull that.  Last week, oral surgery, there was like this, they had to go up in my gums and screw and  then yank it out.  And then they had to take the bridge all the way to the back, the two teeth.  So they filed the teeth down in the back, and they're going to make the bridge all the  way across.  And this is a temporary, and it keeps falling out. 
[00:58:00]  So I figured, you know.  Can we get the abridged version?  But I want to get these.  I've got to tell you one thing.  Your teeth are starting to look normal these days.  I know.  When we first met you, what was going on?  They were big.  You just weren't making a lot of money?  No.  Well, here's the thing.  I want to get implants, and they're like $3,000 apiece.  Double these?  What are you going for, Rich?  What are the big bears like at the gay convention?  I appreciate the, you know, getting the tits, dude.  So, wasn't that horrible looking? 
[00:58:30]  It's just horrendous.  Yeah, that's deep.  You instantly turn into a hillbilly.  Like, the second you pop your teeth out, you're a hillbilly.  I went from being on stage to being one of your fans, like that, overnight.  Nothing.  No.  I'm setting you guys up with a lot of shit, so don't fuck yourself.  Yeah, for the soundboard.  We got the audio of Pat from Monaki losing the eggnog drinking contest.  I think he's a little upset about this, Pat.  Has anyone talked to him since Friday? 
[00:59:00]  No.  No.  No, I didn't see any posts or anything.  I think he's just sulking.  Maybe he's in a hospital somewhere.  Getting another toe lopped up.  Well, he's got diabetes, so I don't think doing 71 double shots of eggnog is a smart thing.  And he didn't seem to have vomited as much as he did the year before.  No, I think this was after the show.  I went into the bathroom before, you know, I left for the day, and he was in there.  You heard about what?  Just bathroom stories that could be a problem. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's been suggested, you know, we just not talk about it.  Why?  Until, I don't know, because there's some building guy, and the guy that runs this studio, and they're talking, and I don't know.  It just seems to be a mess.  There's a problem?  Yeah, apparently, someone gave Tippy Tom a flask of booze when he was in here.  One of our homeless guys, yes.  And then he got lost on the floor somewhere. 
[01:00:00]  So he wasn't here in the studio.  He was out, and he was in the bathroom.  And apparently, he thought he was back in the bus station or something, because some guy from one of the reputable companies on this floor went in there to go to the bathroom.  And he was propositioned by Tippy Tom to ask if he wanted a blowjob.  Something I don't think that happens here in this building a lot, the Steinway Building, the historic Steinway Building bathroom.  We could talk about this. 
[01:00:30]  Of course we can.  I just did.  This is hearsay.  Like I listen to fucking Ben.  This is hearsay.  Okay, so what, wait, one of these business guys goes into the bathroom to take his leak?  Yeah, and Tippy Tom.  And Tippy Tom's there propositioning him?  Tippy Tom, first of all, had just shit all over the bathroom also.  I heard there was shit on the walls.  There was shit on the walls.  And there was eggnog vomit.  And we're not supposed to talk about it, but there's pictures up on opianthony.com.  And then some gentleman, because it is a shared bathroom, we have to be courteous, went in there to take a piss.  Yeah.  And he walks into a vomitorium with shit smeared on the walls, and a disgusting homeless guy asks him if he wants a blowjob. 
[01:01:00]  There's nothing more erotic than that.  I'm telling you.  It's like a graphic fetishism to have.  This show is starting to get back to where it was before we got fired.  I've been thinking about that lately.  Yeah, right up to getting fired.  I've been thinking about that lately.  We're finally there.  Yeah.  We're finally there.  Oh.  Oh, I just want to come in and take a leak.  What the?  I just like seeing Bonnie rip the headphones off.  That is great. 
[01:01:30]  Pat Brumanaki, everyone.  There he is.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, guys.  They labeled him former champ on the phones.  Yes.  How are you feeling?  Uh, not bad.  Oh.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  We still going to dinner, or are you inviting Badlands?  Well, Badlands, uh, I was talking to him, and he seems to, uh, have nothing to do for  Christmas, so I figured I'd take him out for Kwanzaa. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, Pat has nothing today, either.  Pat, I saw you in the, uh, the bathroom after the show on Friday, and you were still  puking like crazy.  You get it all out?  Uh, yeah.  I felt pretty good, but I think Badlands was worse for wear.  Because I, I drove him to Penn Station, and he was just, he was groaning all the way  there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Pat, I'm starting a little controversy today.  Yeah, I heard.  I want to see the videotape, because I was watching very closely, and although I, you're 
[01:02:30]  not the champion anymore, I think you set the brand new record.  Are we going to have to have, uh, videotapes available to the refs next year?  Are they, uh, going to be talking about that in the off-season?  No, there's no question we won the contest, because it was all about if you puke, you're  out.  But, Pat...  It's like the, it's like the, it's like the, it's a puke you're from.  Pat, did you...  Oh.  Oh, you don't give him a fucking car crash?  He's not a professional.  Oh, okay.  We have a, we have a curve.  His comedy license has been revoked.  It's impossible for this guy to crash any more than he has. 
[01:03:00]  It's a cliche now to crash him.  Hey, Pat.  He's the worst.  Yes.  I got a question, because I, I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.  Before you puke, did you, uh, do your double shot of eggnog?  I, I thought I drank the whole thing, and then immediately after, then I, he, ho, ho, ho,  Well, I'm hoping to see the video.  Do we have the videotape here today?  Maybe we can all watch it.  You know, if you held on to that cup, uh, a little longer, and didn't try to slam it  the second the clock came around, uh, to 12, uh, you might have won that. 
[01:03:30]  Who knew that they were both struggling that bad?  Because they both puked on the 71st double shot of eggnog.  Yeah.  But I think...  I'm not, I'm not sure.  Maybe my puking, uh, encouraged, uh, Eric to puke.  Oh, is that how you're sleeping at night and dealing with your loss?  He might have been able to hold on a couple more.  I'm not sure.  We couldn't ask for a better contest, by the way.  But, uh, Pat, if you drank that double shot before you puked, you would have the new record  officially.  Because I, I remember seeing Eric puke and then finishing his shot. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, but once you puke, it's over.  Right.  So, I think technically he did 70 and a half double shots of eggnog, and I think you have  the new record of 71.  But we've got to look at the videotape.  Uh-huh.  So that's kind of something you could take away from this year's contest, that you set  a brand new record.  Nice.  Uh, Dan from Albany.  How uncomfortable will Anthony's Christmas dinner be now?  Avoiding eye contact, awkward pauses, Pat knowing that he let you down the same way he did  his own father.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:04:30]  What did the winner get for the contest?  I don't think writing that was necessary, and I certainly don't think reading it was.  The winner got, uh, just a bunch of junk.  Bumper stickers.  Junk.  We don't know.  It was some good swag.  All we know is it was good radio.  We don't give a crap about the prizes.  We should have had this contest out, though, in the public.  Like, it's the title that counts.  Because we don't like broadcasting our show live anymore, because it's, I don't know,  but this is a perfect live broadcast.  It's an easy show to do, and just the visual of seeing these big guys puke is just hilarious. 
[01:05:00]  Like we said earlier, puking is just hysterically funny to watch other people, obviously.  So next year, I think we're going to bring the eggnog drinking contest out to the people.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris?  Hi.  Um, I was watching Frosty the Snowman with my nephew this weekend.  It's amazing the resemblance between him and Pat Moenock.  It didn't look exactly the same and sound exactly the same.  Frosty the Snowman.  I'm going to have to watch that and see.  I haven't seen that in quite a while.  When you see him take off his hat when he's talking to the little wife that they made him,  it's fucking unbelievable, the resemblance. 
[01:05:30]  I've got to crack it up.  It was so hilarious.  And Frosty has the rosy red cheeks, right?  Yeah, just like that.  And he makes stupid jokes, too.  All right, I'm going to have to check that out.  I don't think the fans will Photoshop Pat from Monocchio as Frosty the Snowman.  As Frosty?  No, they would never do that.  I don't think they would do that.  Not that mean.  Corn comp toe with his awful jokes.  Let's go to Bill in New Jersey.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Bill. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, Bill.  Hey, listen.  You guys just said that Pat finished his 71st shot and immediately puked, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  So, uh, the Naga, he, uh, he only drank half of his, and then he puked.  So, how could Pat not be the winner?  I know, it's a little confusing, but, uh, these guys had 30 seconds to do their shot.  It doesn't matter.  Uh...  Another, another, another...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but the guy didn't, the guy didn't finish his.  Doesn't matter.  It's whoever puked first.  Yeah, so, I mean, you could have, like, taken the whole 30 seconds, you know, hoping that maybe the guy would puke, you know, before you or something. 
[01:06:30]  Pat could have held on to his beverage, and...  Oh, man, Pat won, guys.  Come on.  No, don't fuck up with our rules, you asshole.  Yeah, don't mess with our rules.  You shithead.  We know the rules.  Well, you changed the rules by going to the speech yachts anyway.  It's who finishes, or who pukes first.  That's right.  Uh, I don't want to be a Tommy technical, but I did look at the rules, and they did say you need to be an XM subscriber.  Uh-huh.  What? 
[01:07:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, Pat, to me, you'll always be the champion.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  There's a lot of controversy building over the eggnog drinking contest.  People trying to make controversy.  We know the rubles.  Pat, what's that?  Oh, that's my dog.  What do you got, a Rottweiler?  No, it's a golden lab.  I thought you had a cat.  And I have three cats also.  Three cats.  Look at him just trying to get as much love as possible from anything that'll stay even near him for a second. 
[01:07:30]  Do you just overfeed him?  Oh, my God.  Do you sleep with your kittens and your dog?  Do they sleep in your bed?  Yes.  Come on.  I'll make room.  Come on in.  Come on, Dad.  Just like when I was young.  Oh, God.  His father abandoned him when he was a kid.  Did he really?  And then he finds him.  Yeah.  Pat knows where his father lives in Jersey, but he won't go over there.  What, did he leave him at a rest stop or something? 
[01:08:00]  No, he just kind of left him, left his mom, and just took off.  And you won't go?  Yeah, what was the reason for him leaving there, Pat?  I don't know.  I think it was, like, before I was six months old, so.  Oh.  Oh.  Maybe he could see into the future.  Oh.  You know, you're ugly, kid.  I'm leaving.  Oh.  But it's not a...  Oh, you know what?  You've got to think.  You've got to grow up thinking that you're the reason he left.  If he leaves at six months, how long were they together before he left? 
[01:08:30]  I'm not sure.  Nobody ever tells me.  I never even saw a picture of him.  Oh, and your mom doesn't even like you.  They said he didn't like taking pictures, so I kind of don't know that.  Dad.  Oh, shit.  Rich.  I think it might be Regis.  So now he's got no body.  How fucked up is he?  Let's go to Jack in Boston.  Jack.  Hey, Morin Boyd.  You know, you don't need to go to the videotape.  You can go to the audio.  Pat said he never swallowed that shot.  He said he puked before he got it down.  No, I swallowed it, and then I immediately puked.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Well, we're going to have to check out that videotape.  Look at people trying to make controversy.  Yeah.  We run a legitimate contest.  Well, let's go to the audio.  Here's the audio of Pat Permanaki losing the eggnog drinking contest this past Friday.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, could it be true?  Oh, my God.  I don't have to join in. 
[01:09:30]  Memory.  There's more.  I'm coming.  This is a sad thing.  The way I used to.  It's a very sad thing.  Oh, my goodness.  See what daddy's missing?  Oh, jeez.  Look at my cup, dude.  It's a very sad thing.  To see the former champion going down, vomiting like this.  It's like watching out.  Boy, that would have filled up my baby bed.  Oh, this is a sad, sad moment for sport, ladies and gentlemen.  A sad, sad moment for sport. 
[01:10:00]  This is very sad.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Eric Badlands is starting to puke, too.  Goddamn, I could have went one more.  Oh, he was so close.  Now, what happens?  Because they both puked on the same shot.  No, Pat puked first.  Okay, yeah, first to puke.  Pat puked first.  Oh, wow.  Eric?  Eric just puked and then finished his shot, threw it in the garden, and said, give me the trophy. 
[01:10:30]  Eric Badlands Booker.  Wow.  The winner of the eggnog drinking contest for 2005.  And there it is.  That's how it went down on Friday.  Bonnie couldn't even listen to the audio.  I was this close to...  To vomiting?  Yes.  Wow.  Huh?  At least I got an anal probe out of it.  It was one of my gifts.  What?  Oh, did he use the anal probe yet? 
[01:11:00]  I felt like I had the anal probe for the contest.  Gave him a butt plug or something that was around the office.  Let's go to Will in Denver.  Will?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I was curious.  Are the names of old Pat's cats like Dad, Father, and Pops that way, you know?  Dad, Father, and Pops.  Come here, Dad.  Some friskies for you.  Pops, where's Pops?  We can abuse them every once in a while and love them and laugh with them. 
[01:11:30]  Like it's...  Oh.  Play ball with your dog.  Oh, is that horrible?  And that porno I got was off rental.  What?  That porno I got was a rental.  It had a little sticker on it that had one of those numbers that correspond to the box  that it came in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so I was handling it with tongs.  Ugh.  All right, let's say hi to Ryan in New Jersey.  Ryan.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Every time Pat tells his life story, all I think of is Batman Returns with a penguin. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, it's a very similar storyline.  All right.  That's all I got.  Okay.  Someone on the Instant Feedback is kind of pissing me off.  Pam from Manhattan.  She's got to learn to listen.  Opie, you fucking piss ass.  Well, maybe that opener was what pissed you off.  Ah, whatever.  I've been called worse, as they say.  They say the rest of our letter, but...  Opie, you fucking piss ass.  We already know that Pat broke his own record on Friday.  That was not a dispute. 
[01:12:30]  Why are you trying so hard not to have a new winner?  Because the new guy is black?  Damn.  Stop kissing Pat's ass.  Help Pam to lubricate a pin.  I already said that Eric Badlands Booker definitely won the contest.  Yeah, he won the contest.  That's not what I'm disputing.  Disputing the record.  We're just disputing the record.  We think that Pat actually had more eggnog.  Come on, Pam.  And I'm not the racist on this show, Pam, you fuck.  There's no racist on this show. 
[01:13:00]  Well, we got some racism on this show.  You fucking cunt.  Let me tell you, but it doesn't come from me, Pam.  All right, Pat.  Was that a shotgun?  No, that was a big truck barreling down Munaki Ave right next to my trailer.  Pat, listen to me.  You have to go see your father.  Hey, yeah, Pat, can you go knock on your dad's door live on our show?  Yes, you bring the cameras. 
[01:13:30]  After I went off to high dive, my life turned around.  I did it like 10 years later or 10.  You got to go see your father.  You say, you know, hey, you get the story.  Hey, why did you leave?  And life might turn around.  You might not have to come and drink 71 shots of eggnog and puke.  No, no, that's Pat's thing, though.  It made him a star in the show.  No, I know.  You're going to take away his one accomplishment, Rich?  He's afraid if he pulls up to that house, just think, and it's a beautiful house, 
[01:14:00]  and he pulls up just in time to see his dad coming out, kisses his new wife goodbye for  the morning, tussles the little kid's hair, or he's playing catch in the yard.  There's so many awful things that it could be.  Setting up a tent.  A tent to camp out for the weekend.  He'll be like the midget.  He'll tell me, I'm not supposed to leave Munaki.  Right.  Putting stuff on the station wagon, getting ready to go camping.  All right. 
[01:14:30]  Let's say hi to Chuck in New York.  He has a comment about black athletes.  Chuck, go ahead.  Hey, good morning.  It wasn't fair because the black is naturally the superior athlete.  They're bred to drink more eggnog.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy the Greek.  That's Jimmy the Greek.  Right.  From the grave.  They're the better athlete.  They got stronger stomach muscles.  You see, back in the slavery days, when they would breed for strength, there's Jimmy the 
[01:15:00]  Greek just blurting that out in front of the camera, and it was like...  And there goes his career.  Bye-bye.  You just know the cameraman was like, oh my God, I'm getting this.  I'm getting the end of Jimmy the Greek's career.  His long, illustrious career.  Keep talking.  Keep drinking, Jimmy.  Tell us about the blacks and, I don't know, how they run faster.  Well, it's that extra muscle they got in their leg.  He went on and on, and it was hysterical, and it ended his career.  There you go.  Let's go to Tommy. 
[01:15:30]  He was in the contest on Friday.  Hey, Tommy.  Hey, good morning, guys.  What's up?  Brutal.  Brutal contest.  Let me tell you.  In fact, I was the one who puked after...  I think his name was Jay.  He was just heathen all over.  The sound of him made me throw up.  Yeah, yeah.  The highlight...  There were a bunch of highlights in the contest.  The one was when the two huge fat guys were puking one after another.  Double puking.  Double puking.  They were like...  Head-to-head, just puking.  Scalp-to-scalp.  Because we had two buckets.  They were leaning over, scalp-to-scalp, just puking into these buckets. 
[01:16:00]  It was like one of them water fountains.  Those guys were...  He was brutal.  And then I went into the bathroom.  He was in the bathroom puking.  Made me throw up again.  Yeah, the puking...  There was a lot of puking going on in the bathroom.  There was so much puking going on in the bathroom after these guys left the studio.  Kippy Thomas, you know, helps the puking in the bathroom.  See, we learned something for next year's contest.  Stupid me, I thought when you puked in here, that was it.  Oh, no, the puking continued for almost another half hour after they left the studio. 
[01:16:30]  Outside in...  Next year, they're going to have to stay in the studio and just continue puking in the background  as the contest continues.  And that'll help egg on the other contestants.  Yeah, we learn every year to make it better.  That bathroom was completely violated.  All right.  Was Tippi Tom in the contest too?  Thank you, guys.  Tapping out.  Huh?  Was Tippi Tom in the contest?  No, that guy can't be in anything organized at all.  He's a drunk.  You don't understand what's going on in that bathroom Friday.  The guys from the contest were puking like crazy.  Tippi Tom is shitting like crazy. 
[01:17:00]  Oh.  Puking.  Supposedly, it ended up on the walls.  He's one of those guys.  And it was just a mess in there.  He's like the Pollock shitter.  All right.  I guess that's about it.  That was funny.  All right, Pat.  Look at these two.  Pat, what's their life at home?  Yes, sir.  That was a good one.  And you made that joke about the toaster oven just going around the house.  Do you guys talk about the lines that you used on the show on the way home? 
[01:17:30]  All the time.  Well, we'll talk about lines in everyday life.  We'll be like, remember yesterday when I said that?  We'll recap the show going home, what was good, what was bad.  The last time we were on together, I thought she killed what she destroyed.  Bonnie did kill last time.  She killed last time.  Will you recap like your life that day when you go to bed at night?  Sometimes, though.  I remember when I made that comment about the sliding glass door.  I did.  Yeah.  Like, she'll have two fans come up to her, like, after a show.  All right.  And say something nice to her, and, like, two days later, I'll go, you know, remember  my two fans? 
[01:18:00]  Like, this is true.  This is so funny.  This one guy.  Hold on.  Oh.  There it was.  Keith is falling out.  Rich's teeth just flew out of his head.  Hold on.  I've got to go through.  Oh, God.  No, I don't even want to hear what you have to say.  Oh, is that disgusting?  He's taken, ladies.  Rich is trying to say something.  Did the microphone hit your teeth, or did they just go out into the microphone?  Because he normally has them, like, glued up in there, but he took them out. 
[01:18:30]  No.  He said a word.  Oh, my God.  You said a word that just made them fly out of your head.  Dude, your teeth were just, it was raining teeth.  Do you know what it was?  He was, he was making fun of me, and I used my moods on my mind.  Somewhat psychic ability.  Some guy came up to her after a show.  He said, you're very funny.  And a lot of people do, but this guy came up to her and said, you're funny.  Can I get your autograph?  Can you send me a picture or a headshot?  Right?  Three weeks later, she goes, oh, I've got to get some envelopes.  I've got to send that guy a headshot.  But she remembered her one fucking fan, like, from three weeks ago. 
[01:19:00]  And look how you're looking, like, oh, isn't that cute?  You're one, my one fucking fan.  No, I know.  She has a lot of, don't get me wrong, but it was foolish.  I don't have any fans.  I'll admit it.  And also.  You do?  I never get recognized.  So when it happens, it's kind of.  It's kind of fun.  You ever get caught using the same line.  Don't blow up her spot.  In a movie.  I'm not talking about on stage, Rich.  I'm talking about in life, like you're watching a movie.  I've done this before, and it's kind of embarrassing.  And a part comes up in a movie, and you'll say a funny line, and your girlfriend  just goes, you said that last time.  Yes, he does do that. 
[01:19:30]  Oh my gosh, shit.  Shit, I forgot.  I remember, yes.  So I added a little different twist to it this time.  No?  Nothing?  Nothing?  It gives me nothing.  All right.  Pat, we're going to let you go, all right?  Can Rich do duck season, rabbit season with those teeth?  Like Daffy's bill?  I'll bring it back.  All right, Pat, just like your father, we're going to let you go.  Oh, I think cameras go into his dad's house with him, get him all ready. 
[01:20:00]  No, honestly, we joke about this, but when we brought this up to him in studio, oof.  Why'd he get all sweaty in there?  Oof.  Very, very uncomfortable.  The whole mood kind of changed.  Yeah, I bet.  Pat, he's a fun-loving guy.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  We brought this up, and oof, the serious Pat started coming out.  Over the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Pat.  It'd be like sitting down with the Ramses and going, Jean Benet was such an odd name.  Just out of nowhere.  Just picture how they would react to that. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  That's Pat talking about his father.  So where does he live?  Is it close to Munaki?  Have you seen this chill over the whole room?  All right.  Take care, Pat.  I'll see you on Christmas.  All right.  It's going to be a Pat from Munaki Christmas.  Yeah, something to live for.  Yeah.  After that, I might have a problem.  What about New Year's?  All right, Pat.  Thank you. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  I've been trying to hang up on him for 10 minutes.  I feel bad, though.  Hang in there, Pat.  I feel bad.  Remember that one contest you guys did where they had a drink, and they were pissing themselves  standing there in buckets, and they had a piss, and one guy drank, the other guys pissed  or something?  No, come on.  It was, we had people eating clam chowder.  Well, that's another one.  Yeah.  He's talking about the one where we had guys drink until they had to take leeks.  Yeah, but it was no piss drinking. 
[01:21:30]  Didn't one guy do something his father found out?  Oh, he's talking about the, yeah, okay.  I don't know.  Now we're confusing the whole subject, so forget it.  I'm just talking about the clam chowder one in Boston.  Where we had guys eating clam chowder, and they puked to win Super Bowl tickets, and  one guy ate.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  What happened?  What happened was, it was pretty much like the egg night drinking contest, but they had  to do it with clam chowder, right?  And the last person to puke won the Super Bowl tickets.  And in typical Opie and Anthony fashion, the Super Bowl was in New Orleans, I think. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  And we didn't have a way for these people to get there.  We just gave them the tickets.  Walk, motherfucker.  And it was like two days before the Super Bowl.  Yeah, that's going to be an easy flight to figure out.  And you could get a hotel.  No problem.  Yeah, you had to get a hotel, and you had to get there yourself.  But people still came to do the contest.  Pathetic, man.  That's what radio's all about.  It's pathetic.  That's why satellite radio's a little better.  They have some money, and they have no problem spending it.  That's right, Robin.  So then, uh...  500 million.  Woo-hoo. 
[01:22:30]  And then, uh...  And then we found out we had another pair of Super Bowl tickets, but we ran out of clam  chowder.  But we had the bucket that they all puked into.  So we're like, hey.  There was like 10 guys and a couple girls as well in the studio.  We're like, who wants to win this pair of tickets?  A few people raised their hand.  We're like, this is what we want you to do.  You take a spoonful of the puked-up New England clam chowder, and one by one, you pass it around,  and they formed a little circle. 
[01:23:00]  And the last person...  The last person not to puke won the second pair of tickets.  It was like a tablespoon full each time.  Let me tell you something.  As far as...  You know, when you start talking about what was the funniest moment on the Opie and Anthony  show, that is so far up there, it's not even funny.  I mean, because you got the puking thing, which is always funny.  And these guys would just take like, I mean, just a tiny teaspoon of the puke and throw  it in their mouth.  Yeah, we were just having them do a teaspoon.  And one by one, watching the people, I guess we figured out... 
[01:23:30]  The gag.  I think we told them, like, you had to not puke for 60 seconds.  So they would do the teaspoon of the...  Of puke.  Of the puke, basically.  And then you would watch these guys as they're trying to hold it down for 60 seconds.  Watch, their face was rumbling, rumbling.  And their lip is moving, and they'd go like...  And they're dry heaving, but they're trying to keep it down.  Trying to keep it down.  And one by one, they just could not keep it down. 
[01:24:00]  It was so freaking funny.  And they're just passing the puke bucket around.  Big puke bucket with a teaspoon in it.  Yeah, all these contests finally coming back to the Opie and Anthony show now that we're  comfortable on satellite radio.  Remember how it was a little browner than the rest of the clam chowder?  Like, there was bile in it.  Bonnie is not even...  She's trying not to listen.  I have a really strong gag reflex.  It was terrific.  I will.  All right.  If I let it go into my head. 
[01:24:30]  Here's the deal, Eric.  Write this down.  I think Steve still has video from that day.  You've got to get the video of this up on the website.  Please.  If Steve wants some hits on his website, some of this video is some of the funniest stuff  you'll ever see.  All right?  Not the actual contest when they finally started taking teaspoons of the puke.  Someone's also saying, you forgot this little tidbit.  Remember, Patty's toenail clippings were in the clam chowder.  We collected her toenails. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, God.  And we brought them with us because it was a live broadcast in Boston.  You know, we were doing our show from New York here.  And we noticed her toenails were horrid.  So, yeah, she got a pedicure, whatever the hell it's called, and we kept them in a little  baggie.  And we brought those up with us.  And dumped them into the puked up clam chowder.  And we were eating the clam chowder with bits of Patty's toenails.  Oh, is that horrible?  Let's say hi to Keith in Rhode Island.  Keith, what's up? 
[01:25:30]  This is Pete from Rhode Island.  I'm sorry, Pete.  That show was like the funniest show I've ever heard.  Yeah, that was a good one.  You remember what happened, though?  The guy who won the original contest, Murph from Southie, never ended up going to New  Orleans.  He ended up selling his tickets for weed and coke.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, he got all kinds of drugs and stuff.  I forgot about that.  I think he sold them right outside the station for like 500 bucks or something like that.  Mm-hmm.  Because, you know, the fans just showed up at the station.  You know what?  I think oavirus.com, maybe they'll post that show in the near future. 
[01:26:00]  It was really funny.  That was a great one.  A lot of our old bits and shows are up on oavirus.com because we can't play that shit  here.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Yeah, it was...  But I'm sure we can post a video because Steve did that on his own time, so hopefully we'll  get some video clips of that up on opandethony.com later today or later this week.  All right, you want to take a break?  Certainly.  You want to say hi to one of your MySpace friends real fast before the break?  Oh, yeah.  This is MySpace Debbie. 
[01:26:30]  Yes, it is.  Hi, Debbie.  I had you up there for a while.  You were like the sex draw from my page.  Is that your hot one?  Debbie with the bikini and...  I think I emailed her the other night.  This might be the only hot girl on MySpace.  No, there's some hot...  No, there's some hot ones.  There are a bunch of hot ones.  The hottest ones I've found so far have been two 16-year-old girls that just for some  reason decide they want to take pictures of themselves in bathing suits, little bikinis.  They put on too much makeup and then them and their little friends are standing in bikinis 
[01:27:00]  with their arms all around each other holding their arm out with the camera and snapping  pictures of themselves and putting it on the website.  Are these pictures up on your MySpace account?  No.  Well, they're part of...  I guess they're in my friends list.  You sure not?  That's what I accepted.  Well, that's good advertising for you, too.  But I didn't put them up on my top eight.  No way.  I need to help you get past Jimmy.  Jimmy's beating you by 900 right now.  No.  You've got to sex up your sight a little bit.  When you look at these 16-year-olds, Mr. Polanski... 
[01:27:30]  Uh-huh.  Ant, I got it.  Hold on.  I got it, though.  We've been talking about Howard Stern and his Boy Scout uniform.  Boy Scout uniform?  A lot of people want to see that picture.  I think if you go to Anthony's MySpace account, that should be one of your top eight friends.  You think?  Can you do it during the commercial?  Probably not.  Somebody would have to sign up and use that as their picture, and then I would make them  a friend.  Well, one of our listeners will do that for you.  Yeah, do that.  All right, because then you'll put it up on your top eight.  That's the Debbie that's on the phone right now.  No.  Stop. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Debbie, what do you do for a living?  I'm actually an accountant.  Look at that.  Yeah, but you're a model, too, obviously.  Well, I am, but my day job is doing accounting.  I do accounting for a bar and a restaurant.  It's a good job.  Yeah, you're beautiful.  Where's she from?  Thank you.  Yeah, where are you from?  I'm from South Dakota.  Are you?  South Dakota.  Is there a comedy club out there?  Have your pictures been in any publications yet?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, this month I'm in about five different magazines. 
[01:28:30]  Biker Magazine did a two-page feature on me.  It's the first time they've done that.  Hustler?  Nope, nope.  Actually, more on motorcycle magazines.  I miss Thursday.  Oh, classier stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Get on the back of my hog.  Take a ride.  Nice.  Are you, well, you know, because this is radio, you're 27, South Dakota.  You're into bikinis and fitness.  You're a model, obviously.  I love bikinis.  I'm totally into them.  You got breast implants, right?  I have like 100 bikinis. 
[01:29:00]  Absolutely.  What are you sporting there, 36Ds?  34D.  34D.  Blonde.  How tall are you?  5'5".  5'5".  5'5", 5'6".  Short for a model.  Yeah, but, you know, when you get a button like that, you don't need height.  Jeez, Bonnie, the claws that come out were short for a model.  She's so hot.  We're looking at her picture, and Bonnie's just trying to rip down anything.  I don't know what she looks like.  Let's be honest.  Sure. 
[01:29:30]  Let's be honest.  Who's not watching America's Next Top Model?  Yeah.  Come on.  Wow.  When you think model agencies, you do think the Dakotas.  Under 5'7", you got to show the snatch.  That's where they come out of.  That's right.  That's the rule of modeling.  Under 5'7", you got to show the snatch.  Double Ds.  How did you find our fine program?  Oh, actually, I've been listening for a long time.  Nice.  Hey, are you good at talking dirty?  Long time listener.  Are you good at talking dirty?  You know, I've got skills. 
[01:30:00]  Well, because we're thinking of a new bit for the radio program.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little bit we like to call Tissue Time with Debbie.  Mm-hmm.  Tissue Time with Debbie is going to be our new bit.  Anthony, you want to explain this brilliant idea that we came up with?  We work very hard coming up with the various bits for the show.  And this is a new one.  That's right.  We brainstormed and came up with this. 
[01:30:30]  Tissue Time with Debbie.  It's going to be you.  Debbie, of course.  The fine model.  And she is going to offer phone sex.  That's right.  For our audience.  That's right.  Wouldn't that be great?  That sounds great, but we should change it to towel time with Debbie.  Oh.  You need a whole towel.  Fuck the tissue, right?  Exactly.  Go to the towel.  Yes.  Or socks.  Will you be up for doing Tissue Time with Debbie?  Sure. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  It's a new bit here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I say we do it this Saturday on this fine channel.  I like it.  Saturday's good.  Would you be?  And then our listeners, what they would do is call in.  Right.  And it would be live phone sex.  Right.  Like you would hear on a phone sex line.  Right.  But only on the radio, uncensored.  You're getting it all.  That's right.  The whole thing.  That's right.  Wow.  That would be a great radio.  What do you think, Debbie?  Do you have a man in your life?  Well, nobody's serious. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  Or you could just like read penthouse forums and stuff and talk about how you're naked  and stuff to a national audience.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And what I'd like to do, et cetera, et cetera.  Exactly.  Are you naked right now, Debbie?  What's that?  Are you naked right now?  I'm just wearing a robe.  That's it.  Just a robe.  Nothing underneath?  Just a robe.  Having my coffee.  Are you alone?  I am alone.  You're alone.  Well, how about we do tissue time with Debbie right now?  Oh, how great would that be?  And remember, you could do anything. 
[01:32:00]  Like, there's no restrictions on what you can say.  You want a guy to call up?  Anthony, you better make Debbie one of your top eight before this bit starts.  Debbie, if you want a bunch of new friends today.  I have all military guys on there, but I'm willing to put in something like a USO friend  for the troops.  Right.  And that would be Debbie.  Yeah, if we could get a guy on the phone now, we could do our tissue time with Debbie  on New Bit.  That's a great New Bit.  We're featuring on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:32:30]  That's right.  You heard it here first.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  Debbie, I mean, can you talk dirty to a guy right now?  I can.  All right.  And you're naked?  I am.  Will you rub that snatch?  No, I will.  I will.  She's got her robe on.  Okay.  Wait, Sarah Silverman doesn't want to hear this?  Why doesn't Sarah Silverman want to hear this today?  I love Debbie.  Maybe I should talk dirty to Sarah.  Oh. 
[01:33:00]  Uh, okay.  No, we need a guy.  All right.  We got John from Whack Bag.  All right.  Hey, John.  Hey, how you doing?  Do you like our new bit?  Uh, this is great.  Somebody should have come up with this a long time ago.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  Tissue time with Debbie.  I did.  It's called the 1-800.  John, are you in your car?  Yes, I am.  How can...  He can't spank it in his car.  Yeah, we don't want you to spank it if you're in your car.  I'll pull over.  I'll pull over?  I'll pull over. 
[01:33:30]  By the way, Anthony.  Yes, sir?  All right, hold on a minute.  We might want to...  His phone's a little crappy.  Oh, he's gone now, anyway.  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, wait.  Is Debbie gone?  I swear to God I didn't do that.  Oh, no.  Debbie!  Oh, my God.  The phone's going nuts.  No, we've got to get Debbie.  Are you sure you didn't hang up on Debbie?  I hate to have to do tissue time with John.  I'll do it if you guys want.  Jesus.  You would, too, wouldn't you? 
[01:34:00]  All right, take your cock out.  Come on.  Everybody is listening.  Take your cock out.  Very good news, Anthony.  The chowder eating video is linked up on opianthony.com.  Watch how many people check out this video today.  Now, it's the video of just the guys eating the puke, right?  We don't need the whole contest.  That's what I was trying to tell you guys.  Well, now we have to wait for Debbie to call back.  God damn it.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  Yeah, we were going to do that. 
[01:34:30]  You have to glue them in?  Go like this.  What's in your hand, then?  Some, like, epoxy-type stuff you put in to hold it in.  Epoxying your teeth in, sir.  You are epoxying your teeth.  It's not epoxy.  It's, you know, like dental shit, recap or something.  You know, if your caps come loose.  It's a real nightmare.  I've got to go to the dentist.  You getting the implants, though?  They're going to screw them right into your skull?  Well, I'm not going to get the implants, no.  I'm just going to get...  That's what I'm working on.  What are they going to fasten that to, then?  Two teeth back here and this tooth here and here.  Four teeth. 
[01:35:00]  They'll fasten.  Jesus.  But I'm going to get...  Are you running out of places to fasten these new teeth in your mouth?  Yeah, I'm going to have to get implants.  They're $3,000 apiece and they drill into your bone.  $3,000 apiece and they, yeah, they go right into your skull.  If you need money that bad, you can be part of our money snatch contest that's coming soon to the show.  He lacks a snatch.  Well.  As far as we know.  Are we doing the money snatch game this year?  Let's bring back some of the benchmarks that people have been talking about for so long that they say we haven't been doing.  I like this.  We're bringing up an old bit like the clam chowder thing and reminiscing about the fun of that. 
[01:35:30]  Yet, we need look only to Friday to find something equally as funny, the eggnog drinking contest.  Right.  I love bringing shit like this back to the show and, of course, let's do that.  All right.  So, we're going to do the money snatch game in the near future.  We're looking for very desperate women that need a little extra spending money.  Holiday time, Opie.  It's the holiday time.  That's right.  A lot of people need money.  That's right.  There's a lot of single moms out there, I guess, struggling just to get by.  Their kids, maybe they've got a little problem. 
[01:36:00]  Maybe they're going out.  They're having a problem relating to the kids and they think, I can buy this love if I could just afford a good present.  Well, we've got a female in the studio today.  Let's get her point of view on this contest.  You know, it's the gift-giving season and we want to help out some less fortunate women out there.  Don't we love giving?  And cash.  What's better than cash?  You know, people love when we give them a MiFi, subscriptions to XM.  They love that.  But, you know, cash is king, they say. 
[01:36:30]  So, we're giving these women cash.  You ever see one of those typical radio promotions where they get that big glass booth and there's money in it and then it starts flying around?  Scott and Todd here in New York at Z100.  Yeah.  They send a fat pig into a bank vault and they got, what, 100 seconds to come out and grab as much money as you can carry but only what you can carry.  That's right.  And then when you leave, they count up how much you have and that's a...  Right, because every time you open your hand, you get more, you lose a little. 
[01:37:00]  You lose a little.  It takes a lot of strategy.  Well, so you're with us so far, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.  But we get women who are a little desperate.  We got the Opie and Anthony spin on this.  A little desperate around the holidays.  They want to get their kid that good present and they just can't afford it.  Those are the girls we're looking for.  It's the same principle.  There's a room full of money, cash all over the place.  A lot of singles.  But in there, you're going to see fives, tens, twenties, even fifties.  A lot of money in this spread out all over the place.  And the girls at the proper time, how many girls did we have last time? 
[01:37:30]  About ten or so.  About ten girls are in there and they have to pick up as much money as they can in a set amount of time.  I believe we gave them probably 102 seconds.  One of those things, 102 seconds.  The trick is, they can't walk out with it in their hands.  Let's just put it that way.  This must be...  They can't use their hands.  That's why it's called money snatch.  You're snatching the money up.  That's one way.  But see, the money can only come out of the room shoved in their snatch. 
[01:38:00]  Whatever money they can put in their vagina, they get to keep.  You guys have to be careful.  These are all women who've had kids, right?  They might get out of there with a lot of money.  They might have the big badges.  We've noticed, and the strategies that were going on.  One girl just had a pile in front of her, slowly rolling it as tightly as she possibly could.  Getting as many of the big bills in that roll before she finally, you know, jammed it up there. 
[01:38:30]  Others, just fistfuls like cabbage.  Just shoving cabbage.  Ow!  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  I like the roller technique.  I think that was...  And one of the funniest parts of that one was when the girls were...  Counting their money at the end.  They're...  Well, no, that at the end was great.  But during the contest, what the girls were doing as a strategy was getting on the floor,  raking money into piles in front of them, and then starting to roll it and insert it. 
[01:39:00]  Now, that's not really the spirit of the game, is it?  Because then, you know, they're all just kneeling on the floor, not much action.  So, uh, that's when Rick came by with the, uh, leaf blower.  Yeah.  We'll have a leaf blower.  And just started blowing their piles of cash all over the place so they couldn't stack it up.  So there's a little more dignity ruining.  So you see the studio, we're going to clear everything out, and we're going to have money  hanging from the ceilings, it'll be on the walls, it'll be all over the floor.  All over the floor.  No coins.  No coins. 
[01:39:30]  Well, maybe a couple of rolls of quarters.  Not a bad idea, actually.  Any girls, a real sport.  Because, let's put it this way, if you want to shove, that's ten bucks.  That's ten bucks.  You want to put it up your ass, we got nothing to say about it.  All right, girls?  You want to make an extra ten?  You want to make an extra ten and shove that rolling quarters up your ass?  That's right.  Hey, God bless.  Can they put it in their mouth?  No.  No.  It's dirty.  What's funny about that money?  Yeah, you don't know where that money's been.  It might have been from the last time we played this game.  That's right.  We know where the money's been. 
[01:40:00]  Because we have played this contest.  Money snatch.  So, the girls will march in naked.  So, you can't be a...  You have to come into the studio naked and leave the studio naked.  And, yeah.  And they keep whatever they get.  There's no winner who has the most money.  No.  They just keep whatever they get.  No.  We'll get a few thousand bucks all over the studio.  No problem.  Wow.  No problem.  What happened to Debbie?  We've been just stalling here.  She's not calling back.  Maybe the phone lines are down in the Dakotas.  I'm back.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Let me say that.  You're not Debbie. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  You're not in a robe.  I was in Hustler.  You're not Debbie, but you're coming in for that fucking snack contest.  I couldn't think of any dirty bag.  Believe you me.  What?  Rich is going to whore Bonnie out for the money snack.  I want new teeth.  Come on, sweetie.  No, but this is the problem that I would have.  Go for the quarters, baby.  Next to ten.  You know, I've exclusively pretty much dated Jews my whole life.  Have you?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  You're practically a virgin still.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, this is the thing.  I have a really little vagina, so I wouldn't be good at the game. 
[01:41:00]  Well, you just want to lift the fucking world and know you've got a little vagina.  I was...  Well, the joke really is that you have a small penis.  Yeah, right.  Not that small.  It's pretty nice.  You didn't break my hymen.  You have another little Jewish kid living inside you?  All right.  Here's the deal.  I've still got my yarmulke.  My hymen.  Let me set up the deal.  I'm going to fix my teeth.  All right.  Rich Voss is here with his lovely wife, Bonnie.  Bonnie McFarlane.  They're helping us out today.  Mm-hmm.  We've got Rich Voss' stand-up routine from 1990. 
[01:41:30]  We're going to do that today.  We've got a story about a guy getting...  It's not just his stand-up routine, by the way.  We'll sit down.  It's him from...  What's...  John Davidson's show.  No, it was the Joan London show, but he was filling in that day.  Oh, well, thank God.  Wow.  It looks like almost before there was television.  Remember that commercial?  Long live...  Remember the commercial?  Long live the dry look from Gillette.  That was the hairstyle he had.  John Davidson.  And your hairstyle was beyond... 
[01:42:00]  And I...  Believe me, I went through many years with probably the worst hair ever.  You come in a close...  I'll even give it...  It's probably a tie.  Right.  But I will never say that your hair was worse than mine was back then, around the same  time, too.  But yours was so bad.  Didn't you have acne all around your face?  No.  From where your greasy hair was?  Your greasy, hairy curls?  Like, didn't it...  It looks like it's wet.  No, it's just...  It was...  We've got to get a clip on the website. 
[01:42:30]  That's one thing I never realized either.  I don't know if you can see this tape.  What?  Back when I was growing up, I had, like, hair.  It was just this tangled, messy, Afro mess thing.  And, of course, I had, like, zits all over my face.  Cut your fucking hair, idiot.  And get the grease pit out of your face.  And maybe that might have helped.  Right.  You know, you do...  If I ever invented a time machine, it wouldn't be to go and see the winner of a race and then  go back and bet on it.  The first thing I would do is go back and punch me in the fucking face. 
[01:43:00]  I would slap me silly.  You'd be your own black man.  Yeah, that's what I would do.  In English class, I would turn around and punch me in the face.  Maybe that was Howard.  Cut your hair, asshole.  Did you have it when you were in school?  Like, that...  It got curly, but when I was even in high school, it was like a big Afro.  That's what mine was constantly.  It was like frizzed out Afro.  And there was nothing I could do with it.  But I didn't want short hair. 
[01:43:30]  No.  Because everybody in the late 70s growing up had long hair.  If you had short hair, you weren't cool.  That's what I had to do.  So it wasn't long hair.  I thought if the more it grew out, it would finally weigh so much that it would fall down  into Peter Frampton style.  But no, I had like fucking Angela Davis Black Panther Afro that never did anything but...  And there was nothing I could do with it.  Like, I woke up in the morning, and all I could do was kind of like shape it like a hedge.  I know. 
[01:44:00]  Like, I took a brush, and like, I'd brush it forward, and then I'd kind of flip it to  tease it.  Like, and just...  It would end up with this big link from the Modspot ball on my head.  I was like the red-haired kid from Room 222.  All this...  Yes, I am pulling out all the 70s references.  But that was it.  It was awful.  You also starred in The Crips.  I know.  It's funny.  You're hanging out with Joanne Chesmart.  My hair was so big like that, and I was sick of having like frizzy, curly hair.  So I came into New York, and I went to a hairstylist, and I got a shag. 
[01:44:30]  Remember the shags that they had like...  Oh, no.  Like David Cassidy or whatever.  You needed straight hair for that.  They did it with a hot comb or something, right?  Oh, good.  Yeah, you're going to do that every day.  No, but wait.  Here's what happened.  I left there, and I had the perfect shag.  It was like so cool in school.  You had a shag, right?  And it lasted for like a week.  And his teeth just popped out again.  Jesus Christ, Rich.  Will you go glue your teeth back in your mouth?  Put your fucking teeth in your mouth. 
[01:45:00]  I don't...  You just wrecked another story.  Will you go glue those fuckers back to that story, too?  I was relating, and then his fucking choppers fly up.  So I can finish the story.  Holding his fucking teeth in, folks.  A fucking week later, I couldn't get the...  It frizzed back out.  I couldn't get the hot comb like they did in New York.  Of course.  And it just blew up again.  All right.  Oh, it's fucking drool off this fuck.  He's drooling in his teeth.  All right, listen.  Oh, Rich.  Obviously, we should say, Rich.  Go clean yourself up.  We got a great story about a guy breaking into an apartment and trying on girls' lingerie. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  Caught on tape doing that.  Saw that video.  Very good.  We're waiting for Debbie.  We're just stalling.  Debbie is going to play our new bit, Tissue Time with Debbie.  Hey, Debbie.  If we don't get Debbie, we need someone else that's really good at phone sex today.  We want to try out this bit and see how it does, okay?  Debbie, check your MySpace.  Our brand new bit.  Because the phones are just going nuts, so she might not be able to get through.  So check your MySpace.  We gave you another phone number you could call.  Yeah.  But we want to do Tissue Time with Debbie today. 
[01:46:00]  Great.  Now I've got to take a leak and watch Voss glue his teeth in.  I know.  Also, Anthony, the NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters, they got radio ads out.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, they're not afraid or threatened by satellite radio.  It's a goof.  It's a joke.  It's a lark.  It's a fad.  Satellite radio.  Obviously, their free radio is much better.  Yet, at every turn, the people in charge, the National Association of Broadcasters, cannot 
[01:46:30]  stop bashing and trying to undermine satellite radio with commercial ads.  They got anti-satellite radio commercials.  Yep.  We'll listen in on those and see what those are about.  Satellite radio pretty much just goes on the air.  You listen to it and realize how much regular radio sucks.  Yeah.  They have to put ads on to tell you how good regular radio is and how much satellite radio  sucks.  But no threat.  No threat.  Bunch of dopes. 
[01:47:00]  It'll backfire.  It'll turn more people onto satellite radio.  Remember I was saying how I listened to the 1010 Winds news station or 88 here in New  York on the way in?  Can't even do that anymore.  That was like the last bastion of regular radio that I ever went to.  Can't do it anymore.  There's one story, traffic, and then some awful hospital commercials will come on, like four  of them in a row, about how we can treat you for cancers of the head, neck, chest, arms, 
[01:47:30]  groin.  And then it's always some cheesy, bad piano music playing in the background, like very  subdued piano music.  And it's like funeral music.  If your child has leukemia, give us a call.  We can help.  We could treat.  And then prostate cancer.  We have radioactive seed transplantation.  And I'm sitting there, it's the first thing in the fucking morning.  I just want to hear the news.  I'm trying to get updated for the show.  And I'm just being inundated by this horrible, awful images of disease. 
[01:48:00]  I had no idea there were so many tumors out there.  There are so many tumors and a commercial for everyone.  Tumors of the neck.  Tumors.  High lid.  We have stereotactic radio surgery that directly delivers radiation to your tumors of the neck,  head, ass, chest, cock, balls, vagina, urethra.  Underarms.  Armpits.  Your hair.  You have a tumor in your hair?  We could cut it off.  Oh, just like, it gives me what I call the heebie-jeebies. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  If other ladies want to do tissue time today, give us a call.  If you're good at the phone sex, give us a call, because we can't get a hold of Debbie right now.  Do you got your cock out?  Is your cock out?  I'm touching myself.  If no ladies call, we're going to have Bonnie do it.  Tissue time with Bonnie.  If there's a spot on your cock, it could be cancer.  Call us at the North Shore Medical Center.  We will get rid of your cock, cancer.  At least then I'd probably listen, because that would be funny.  It's never funny. 
[01:49:00]  It's like small children.  I have type 3 diabetes, and mommy says, oh, no, I'm driving.  I'm getting depressed.  And then I instantly have to punch out to, like, XM70s for some wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Now that's happy.  Hey, wonder how you're feeling.  I want to hear about tumors.  I want to hear Peter Frampton. 
[01:49:30]  It's my drive-in now.  No more news.  No more tumor talk.  Tumor talk on 1010 Winds.  Tumor talk with Debbie.  It's horrible.  Cancer of the heel.  They come up with cancers like, I've never heard, you know, everyone's got the family  members that have had the cancer.  You know, what do you got, Grandpa?  If I, ah, it's the lung, the, you know, the liver, something bad.  Yeah.  This is like, I don't know, cancer of the Achilles heel.  What?  Yeah.  You haven't heard of that one.  All right.  We'll continue with the O&A program in just a bit. 
[01:50:00]  We've got Francine in the studio.  You ready for the news, Francine?  Yeah.  Hi, Francine.  Hello, Anthony.  You like Anthony better than me.  What about Bill?  I said hi to Bill.  Hi, Bill.  Hey, how are you?  I love your show.  This post is great.  Oh, oh, a way to bring it up.  What do you mean?  If Dave Chappelle didn't, like, decide to go away for a while, it would still be doing 
[01:50:30]  that show.  Yeah, I wouldn't be hanging out doing this shit.  It's a soft subject, I think.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I really liked it, though.  I just want to say I liked it.  Sore.  Sore.  Yeah, I mean, it was just like a great moment of my life, and now it's over, and I was just,  you know, starting to not, like, think about it every day.  Didn't Ben tell you?  Good job.  No, he didn't tell me.  Everyone has been told around here not to mention that.  You ever heard us bring it up?  No, I haven't.  We haven't even asked Bill the question everyone asks Bill. 
[01:51:00]  What's Chappelle up to?  We don't even ask, because we know it bothers him.  And you had to just casually say that to him.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's, I didn't know, I didn't know what's happening.  I still liked it, though.  It was great.  Oh, bring it up again.  There it is again.  Wow.  This is not a bit.  He doesn't want to hear that.  Okay.  Eek.  All right.  I apologize to you.  I'm sorry, Bill.  A little late.  A little fucking late.  Well, this is a little uncomfortable. 
[01:51:30]  I'm sorry, Bill.  I told you to not fucking bring it up.  They're testing you.  Oh.  Don't ever bring it up again.  Okay.  Don't even make eye contact with me for the rest of this week, okay?  Fucking act at the floor.  What aren't you supposed to bring up as far as Bill Burgo from now on so we know for next  time?  Because some people are saying you're dumb.  I want them to know you're not dumb.  That you know and won't be bringing this up anymore.  Right.  I believe it should help us.  Jesus fucking Christ.  How many fucking times? 
[01:52:00]  I was just getting past this fucking shit.  Don't bring it up.  Un-fucking-believable.  Don't bring it up.  Okay.  Now, you know, finally, you do know that this is off limits.  Okay.  But wouldn't never again be brought up ever.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we get this out of the way? 
[01:52:30]  Repeat it for me, Francine.  Yep.  I, Francine.  I, Francine.  Will never.  Will never.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  Bring up the Dave Chappelle show.  Bring up the Chappelle.  Oh, my God.  Get her out of here.  Opie and Anthony.  XM2-8.  Burn!  Burn!  Get some good to burn!  Burn! 
[01:53:00]  Burn!  Get some good to burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Get some good to burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Get some good to burn!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  On the way.  Tissue time with Debbie.  Yeah.  Or tumor talk with Debbie.  We haven't decided what direction to go in.  And if there's other hot ladies out there that are good at the old phone sex, give us a call today.  One of the many things we're doing on the program.  We've got Rich and Bonnie in the studio. 
[01:53:30]  And we've got to get right to this story about the guy getting caught breaking into an apartment and trying on some girls' lingerie.  Yeah.  I haven't seen the video yet.  I've heard about the story.  Yeah.  The guy's a real creep.  Seen that.  He's a...  Your typical...  Looks like a...  Internet...  Pedophile-looking...  Creepy guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's cameras everywhere.  You've got to just stop doing the dumb stuff.  Cameras are too available to people so that...  And this guy apparently had been doing this for a while and she noticed something weird, something out of place all the time. 
[01:54:00]  So, it's not like the old days where, you know, you've got to stake it out.  There's so many really cheap cameras available now.  You just pop one on there and take a look-see.  See what's happening.  When he opened the closet, Dateline was right there.  All right.  Not bad.  How about the guy that walked in naked?  Yeah.  Maybe he just took the clothes off the ground.  Okay.  The Dateline story is fantastic.  It is one of the best things that has been on TV in the last five, six years of pedos. 
[01:54:30]  We're going to show you now a home intrusion caught on tape.  A young woman in Texas noticed some rather strange events in her apartment and decided to install an undercover camera.  And what she discovered?  I think everybody's nightmare.  A stranger invading her home.  And today, a Houston man is going to be charged in court with a rather bizarre crime.  There he is.  The man that a woman says gave her the fright of her life.  The 22-year-old woman lives alone in this upscale, gated community in Houston, Texas. 
[01:55:00]  Suspecting someone had been in her apartment while she was out, she set up a camera hidden in a clock.  She kind of thought maybe somebody was just messing with her.  She didn't know how serious it was.  Here she is coming home to check the camera.  And here is what it caught.  A man sneaking in, prowling around, and not for the first time, police suspect.  From what we've gathered, he's probably been in an apartment at least six times.  Wow.  And she noticed, yeah, things out of place, I guess. 
[01:55:30]  Put a camera there.  Ah!  What happened?  Oh.  Oh.  It's a face transplant picture.  Face transplant.  They keep popping that up.  That's like a monkey's mouth.  It was a partial face transplant.  Yeah, they kind of went around her nose.  It got the full nose and all around the mouth and some of the cheek.  Kind of looks like.  Like a little bit.  Like a chimp.  Looks like a chimp.  Yeah.  They just kind of snapped it on there and sewed it on.  But she's got to take all kinds of anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life. 
[01:56:00]  And even that's not a guarantee that that can just be rejected by your body.  Can you imagine?  So all of a sudden, you know, your face just starts rotting away.  Starts with a little pimple.  Yeah, maybe like, but it's a fucking poltergeist moment.  You're in front of the mirror just pulling your face away.  It's like you're looking into the ark.  That's terrific.  What do you call it?  But it's going to leave a scar right around her like that, isn't it? 
[01:56:30]  Like she gives a shit about a scar around the side of her face.  Her face was eaten by a dog.  A little pancake.  She had nothing.  She had no nose.  So what did they get to skin and stuff?  They took it from a dead person.  Like a face off a...  Yeah.  It was a donor from a freshly dead person.  They cut it, and then they, you know, used that as a pattern to trim away any of the meat around her face.  Dead.  It was a perfect fit.  And then they stitched it on.  And, yeah, she'll have a scar there, but it's better than having where a dog ate your face. 
[01:57:00]  Well, what they really do is...  Sounds like a good sitcom moment when she runs into people from the other person's funeral.  Oh, imagine that, like, the person's mother just always wants to come over and kiss your lips because they were her lips.  Like, oh, could you...  No, I'm busy today.  I just want to kiss her lips one more time.  Oh, no, I really...  She gave you the gift of a face.  A face.  You can't let a mother come over and give her a kiss one last time. 
[01:57:30]  Why can't I come over?  Very busy.  I'm working today.  My mother has to come over and pinch the cheek.  Pinch the cheek.  Which one is it yours?  Oh, my God.  The uncle comes over.  I got your nose.  I used to play this with her all the time.  Give me just one more time.  She has to go take photos with him.  Oh, yeah.  Come to...  But she's got to...  But it's got to be zoomed in so you just see her mouth and nose.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Kind of face.  We got more video of the break-in. 
[01:58:00]  We got to just finish this up.  Then the video becomes disturbing.  The intruder takes off his clothes, tries on the woman's lingerie, and then indulges himself in X-rated behavior.  Afterward, he checks the hallway and slips out.  It's the kind of thing police say could easily escalate.  And who knows what that could lead to.  You know, maybe today I watched her, tomorrow I'm going in her apartment, or maybe the next day it goes beyond that.  Police have just arrested and are charging a man who lives nearby, 37-year-old Sean Rogers. 
[01:58:30]  The woman says she doesn't know him and never would have been sure she was right if it hadn't been for her own detective work that caught it all on camera.  You know what?  This lady's a tease.  Just leaving her clothes around.  She's asking for it.  Yeah, leaving her clothes around in a room.  How did he get in the house?  Broke in.  He had a key?  Oh, he got a key?  How did he get a key?  They don't know.  See, I'll tell you how he got a key.  There's a problem here.  She parked her car.  She parked her car and left the keys, like I told you. 
[01:59:00]  You and your goddamn parking attendant thing.  No.  You don't leave your keys with anybody.  That's how you get a key, because you leave your keys with people.  No, shut up with that.  He probably had been in there before.  Or maybe stole one of her keys or something.  I'm thinking maybe something going on between these two beforehand.  Maybe.  Yeah, there's some kind of connection.  You think something...  No, she said she never knew him or never saw him.  Oh, she said.  That's what she's saying.  Well, of course you go.  I know this creep.  Let's go to Jim in Staten Island.  Jim?  Yo, guys, good morning.  Listen, real quick, that thing with the face transplant, they did the nip tuck a couple 
[01:59:30]  of weeks ago.  Yeah.  It worked out horribly, but it's freaking wild, man, how they just, like, take the face off  only, you know, really.  But the odds of this working out for this broad are, like, slim to none.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  I didn't hear that.  She's going to have to go with the Mr. Potato pop-on face.  Pop-on face, yeah.  Like the CIA guy that made the pop-on nose for that woman.  Well, there was a, God, remember the guy that had a hole completely where his nose  used to be, and they gave him a pop-on nose? 
[02:00:00]  That was the creepiest thing ever to watch.  Snap-on nose.  Snap-on nose.  Wasn't that guy in True Romance?  I don't know.  Do you remember the snap-on hair?  Yeah.  They would put two holes in your skull.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they would drill it, like, to your skull, the regular snaps.  So you could go swimming with them.  And it was a toupee.  Maury's wigs don't come off.  And you could just snap it to your skull.  That's great, Maury.  It's, uh...  I think it was magnets, right?  It was...  It went right into... 
[02:00:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, maybe they have magnetic ones.  It went right into your skull.  But this one snapped.  There were snaps.  Like, you'd hear it, like...  Oh, okay.  Snap in.  I don't remember that, yeah.  Yeah, this guy, he said on Nip and Tuck, that's...  They didn't do a face transplant.  They did maybe reconstructive surgery.  This, in France, is the first one that was ever done.  Yeah.  Nip and Tuck is fiction.  And it's fake.  It's a TV show.  Oh, I thought that was one of those things on Bravo where they do the...  Some things are fake.  Some things are real.  Well, hold on.  We got an update.  We might have a snag as far as tissue time with Debbie goes. 
[02:01:00]  Uh-oh.  Just got a communique from the lovely and luscious Debbie.  She writes,  Oh, my God, I just got off a half-hour phone call with my mom.  She was texting me, do not do this, while I was on with ONA.  She was listening in her car, and I got an earful about skanky versus classy, blah, blah, blah.  But it's...  She's been real protective since my dad died.  Oh.  All right, wait a minute.  Your mom has XM and listens to the show? 
[02:01:30]  She's got to be a real class act.  Is that what I heard?  Yeah, how classic can your mom be if she's listening to this drivel?  I think she made it up.  Oh, boy.  Oh, our brand-new bit is having a huge problem.  You can find a hot girl to do phone sex.  But it's called Tissue Time with Debbie.  Well, we'll just change the name.  All right, Tissue Time with...  Are you pants off?  Put whore's name here.  Yeah.  How about, um...  All right, we need a girl to take one for the team. 
[02:02:00]  If you're good at the phone sex, you've got to call up.  I'll do...  I'll turn you gay.  Is that how good you are?  Yeah.  Just be like, you know something?  I'd rather have a man-ass.  After me, you'll want to take the garbage out at three in the morning.  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.  Oh, no, don't act like it's my fault.  Yeah, really.  I love how I wish the listeners...  See, this is why we need a webcam in here.  The fact that after every line, Rich says,  he's got to push on his teeth with his thumb. 
[02:02:30]  You know when his joke's done, he pushes on his teeth.  There's going to be no stepping on anything Rich says today.  And you know how pathetic he is?  He just pushes up on his teeth.  I would be normally making fun of him, but I feel bad.  Yeah, you want people to come to your show, man.  They're going to come.  I'm going to get them fixed.  My teeth are...  No, don't even have them fixed.  Just do your whole act.  Flying out into someone's chicken wings.  With the possibility that they're going to fly out in the middle of your act.  By the way, this is how pathetic he is. 
[02:03:00]  We took a break, finally, right?  We only have a few moments to go do what we have to do.  Some people go and get a little breakfast or a cup of coffee.  Others go take leeks.  Rich goes to the bathroom.  He only has enough time to do one of two things.  Either glue his teeth back in or smoke a cigarette.  He chose the smoke a cigarette.  The par holds it in.  I thought you were going to the bathroom to glue those suckers back in.  I got some glue in. 
[02:03:30]  I do some.  A little bit.  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, another sitcom moment for the face transplant is when the donor's uncle comes over and puts  his cock in her mouth while she's sleeping.  Watch it out.  Oh, is that awful?  Who the hell are you?  Shut up.  Lay there like you used to.  No one's going to believe you. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, is it really rape if it's not her face?  Yeah.  Right?  Who's going to...  Someone's got to figure this stuff out.  The victim is technically dead.  Right.  You could maybe get a necrophilia rap.  Someone's really got to figure this stuff out if we're going to go down these roads.  And the uncle leaves by saying, and I hope for your sake you don't get an ass transplant.  Nigel from Kentucky.  Hey, everybody.  There's actually a guy that lives in Maceo, Kentucky.  I saw him on Ripley's Believe It or Not and read about him in the paper. 
[02:04:30]  He's got his entire face had rotted off, and he's got a snap-on face that includes eyes,  nose, mouth.  Yeah, he had the creep and crud.  Oh, he had the skin-eating.  Skin-eating disease.  Yeah, and...  I saw that on TV.  That's hot.  How do you get that?  He lost everything, man.  He lost from...  Just make a circle from your eyebrow, above your eyebrows, all the way down to your mouth.  You ever see Westworld?  The whole thing was gone.  You ever see Westworld? 
[02:05:00]  Remember when they took the robot's face off?  Yeah, yeah.  To do maintenance?  That's exactly the portion of his face that was missing.  Well, but he got this disease.  Couldn't he stop it somewhere?  No, you can't stop it.  And the gross part was, he talked about how he could reach in with his fingers and clean  out his sinuses.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This is true.  Ah!  This is true.  And he's trying to blow people in the bathroom next to Tibby Tom right now.  Oh, God.  How gross.  Listen, we got Debbie on the line from MySpace. 
[02:05:30]  We got to get to the bottom of this tissue time with Debbie thing.  But first, Wendy in Nebraska.  Hey, Wendy.  Where the hell is New Braska?  Oh, God, guys.  Well, I know how creepy God got in her apartment.  Oh, how?  They never changed the locks when she moved in.  Oh, you think he might have lived there before?  Yeah, I had a son that lived there before, and he had a key.  That's how he got in.  You must change the locks of your house when you move in.  Every two weeks.  Rich says no?  Every two weeks.  Every two weeks.  What are the eyes of the guy that used to have the key is the same type of guy that likes 
[02:06:00]  to wear ladies' clothing.  That doesn't...  All right.  You know what I mean?  Somebody got...  He got the keys.  He's a freak.  All right.  Go take out the garbage.  Let's...  I'm just...  What do you mean?  I'm giving a great explanation.  That's not it.  Where's Debbie?  Can we get her on the line here, or we're talking to her?  Oh, here she is.  Okay.  Debbie from MySpace.  Debbie.  Hi.  One of Anthony's friends on MySpace.  Debbie, you're letting down the whole nation today.  I know.  I got...  I just got so much shit from my mom.  She just freaked out. 
[02:06:30]  Now, she listens to this show?  You know, she usually doesn't, but I told her I was going to call in, and how did I know  she was actually going to listen?  She doesn't get mad when you ride for a weekend and do crystal meth and sleep with bikers?  That doesn't bother her?  No, that doesn't bother her.  No.  No.  That's just a...  Or post Brett Eagle in a magazine.  That's fine.  Yeah.  My dad and brother died of brain tumors two days apart, and...  Oh, Opie.  So, she's been very protective since then. 
[02:07:00]  Let me...  Opie, stop that.  Hit the stop button.  He is so sensitive.  That...  What the fuck are the odds of that happening?  Oh, actually, my grandfather died of a brain tumor when my dad was 11.  Oh, my...  That's terrific.  No, it's not.  That's terrific.  Did you guys get a deal on the funerals?  Yeah.  Actually, we did on my dad's brothers, because they died two days apart, and they felt bad 
[02:07:30]  for us.  Oh, Jesus.  So, it runs in the family.  It's got granddad, dad, and brother.  Wow, who runs?  Debbie, I'm sorry I was being catty with you earlier.  Oh, I really apologize.  That's too bad.  But ever since then, she's been very, you know, very protective.  My dad, he actually gave me the blessing to playboy.  What kind of doctors are you going to?  I'm not going to there, I'll tell you that.  Don't they pick this stuff up?  Didn't they listen to the commercial?  A little early?  On 10-10?  Yeah, on 10-10 wins.  I think we got a quote from one of the doctors early on. 
[02:08:00]  It's not a tumor.  Ah, see?  You see what happens?  You should have got the second opinion, I think.  Second opinion.  Well, don't you think your brother and dad would want you to do this for the radio?  You know, for them?  I think my brother would have gotten a real hoot out of it, but I'm not sure about my dad.  Have the male side of the family just been sterilized?  You know, that was pretty much it for my family, so now it's just like my mom, my sister, and I, hence her very protectiveness.  All right. 
[02:08:30]  Are we done with you?  Can we talk you into this?  Talk me into?  Tissue time with Debbie?  Towel time with Debbie.  You know, I think as long as my mom's listening, she's going to give me...  All right.  Oh, wow.  Hope you got an answer, and that's it.  How radio works.  Too bad for everybody.  Put out or get out.  That's all right.  We'll find another one.  Now we need another woman to help out the team today.  We need another woman to play tissue time with blank. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  Your name will be in the title and everything.  Yeah.  Your name's the title of the bit.  Right, and we got a bunch of guys standing by.  They want to do tissue time.  We talked dirty to one of our fine listeners today.  You can have phone sexual listening.  You'll be jerking off.  You touching the head?  Yes.  Does it have a tumor?  This is what satellite radio is all about.  I'm very happy that we've come up with a brand new bit today.  This one's going to sweep America.  All right.  What do you guys want to do?  You want to do these NAB commercials? 
[02:09:30]  This is kind of...  Oh, we got a puke thing.  Yes, Bonnie?  There's been a lot of sadness here today.  The fellow with the...  The father and then the brother and the father.  I don't know which one is worse off.  Well, I'd say the person that's dead is always a little worse off.  At least there's hope with Pat from Unaki that someday there will be some kind of reconciliation between us.  Well, Debbie's going to get laid in her life. 
[02:10:00]  Well, Anthony, take Debbie off your top eight.  Oh, wow.  Really?  She didn't help the program.  Well, she's not on there now.  Just won't put her back on, I guess.  All right.  We have Carrie from Michigan.  Brain tumors and hot bodies.  That's the genetic thing they have over there.  Carrie?  I've got to weigh that.  Yes?  Carrie.  Carrie?  It's Carrie, yes.  Carrie?  Yes.  With a C or a T at the beginning?  T.  Terry.  Oh, teary.  Teary, as they say it in Michigan.  What's up, Terry? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, not much.  Now, you want it to be Terry.  Tissue time with Terry?  Yes.  I've got to tell you.  You know what?  Your voice isn't really emoting sex.  It might be Terry cloth with Terry.  You can't hear the smile.  Oh, I can't hear the smile.  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I didn't want to miss that one, Rich.  Terry time.  What? 
[02:11:00]  Terry cloth.  Well, why would that be?  I didn't get it.  It's rough.  It's rougher.  Terry cloth.  It's rougher than tissue time.  Oh, my God.  When you just go with sandpaper time.  No, because T and T, Terry cloth and Terry.  Yeah, I know.  But you would think Terry cloth is very absorbent, and it's bigger, so you would be coming more  because...  Since when do you fucking analyze jokes, you motherfuckers?  What's the big deal?  Terry cloth, whatever you want to call it, fucking silkwood, Terry, whatever.  See if the bitch will do it.  I don't know.  All right, listen, Terry. 
[02:11:30]  Is she hot?  Let's talk to Terry a little bit here.  Hey, it's Ross.  Hey, it's Ross.  Hey, it's Ross.  Let's talk to Terry here.  All right.  Terry, what are you about?  What am I about?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's your life?  I'm married and pretty much a homemaker.  How many Vicodians do you do today?  All right.  Are you good at the phone sex?  Oh, I'm very good at the phone sex.  You're very good at the phone sex. 
[02:12:00]  Why would you say that?  Do it for a living.  Past experiences.  Past experiences?  All right.  No, I could do it for a living if I wanted to, but...  Oh, all right.  You know what?  I say we give her a shot.  Are you smoking right now?  No.  Oh, I thought I heard that.  Is she hot?  Are you hot?  Yes, I am.  Like hot, like if people saw you hot or...  You're not like denial hot.  You're hot hot?  No.  I'm hot hot. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Let's...  She doesn't sell it all that well, does she?  I think she's saving up for the actual phone sex.  I certainly hope so.  I think she's going to blow you out of the water.  We got Chris from Kentucky.  Chris?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Getting ready to bring Terry to some pleasure here.  All right.  I think it's going to be the other way.  Yeah, she's going to get you to have to use tissues.  Well, now he's got to respond to what she says. 
[02:13:00]  This is a phone call on a sex phone line, only done on the radio.  That's right.  It's a brand new bit.  Brand new bit.  You're hearing it for the first time.  Never been done on radio before.  On satellite radio.  I believe.  First time.  Tissue time with Terry.  That's right.  And Chris, you've had phone sex with girls?  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  He's lying.  And Terry is given phone sex?  Oh, yes.  Tell me how this works. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, Terry, are you naked right now?  Yes, I am.  Just got out of the shower?  No, I just got up.  Are you going to play with yourself, too, Terry, or are you just going to talk?  Oh, I'll play with myself, too.  Well, that's how it works.  The phone sex line.  The girl plays with herself, talks about how she's playing with herself, asks the guy what he's doing.  She's going to be talking about her nudity.  Right.  And what she's doing to her big, fat vag.  What she wants the guy to do.  The guy talks about her and what he wants her to do. 
[02:14:00]  Mm, I like it already.  How much money did she put in it from last year's contest?  I so don't want to ruin this, but I'm so curious, Hopi.  You know those questions that we should be asking?  We are not asking one of them.  But we're not asking one of them.  Because we want our brand new bit to be a hit today.  I think it's going to work.  Terry, I got my money on you.  Because the voice could either be sultry or trucker, depending on what she looks like.  That's okay.  I think she's going to go with a British accent. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, that would be unique.  Yeah.  That would be unique.  All right.  Well, I say we just kind of listen in and let this brand new bit take hold on satellite radio.  All right.  Terry, if you will, it's now time for Tissue Time with Terry.  Okay.  Chris?  Yes?  What are you wearing?  Nothing.  What about you?  Okay.  Oh, I've got nothing on, baby.  Why don't you take your hand and start sliding it down your chest while I'm doing the same thing? 
[02:15:00]  Sounds good.  What?  Your napples?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Start rubbing on your cock.  Oh, yeah.  You know, if I was there, I'd start licking around the tip of it with my tongue.  Oh, yeah.  Teasing the end of it.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sitting here rubbing my clit, wishing that you could put it up in me. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just smashing your fingers.  Here's my tongue.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Keep stroking it real good.  Squeeze my nipple so I'll lick your clit.  Mm-hmm.  Up into my mouth and hold it between my teeth.  Oh, feels good.  Oh.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, you're going to reach down and rub your balls a little?  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's making it feel good.  Oh.  Sure, really good, as you said, on my cock.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Keep stroking it for me.  Oh, I like it.  Oh. 
[02:16:30]  Make it feel like I was sucking it in and out all the way down the shaft real slow.  Oh.  Oh, dear.  Oh, I like the way that sounds.  Like the way what sounds?  Oh, I like the way you sound.  Oh, I like the way you sound.  Well, I can tell it's making you feel real good.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  You got to lick my pussy a little more?  Oh, I'll lick your pussy all day, baby.  Oh, that's it.  I like that.  Oh, you got hairy pussy?  Oh, yes.  Oh, I like a good hairy pussy.  I love to have your tongue up there looking at my clit while your finger's up inside me fucking me.  Oh, yeah.  Push my chin up against your pussy with my thumb. 
[02:17:30]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'll finger fuck your pussy.  Oh.  Two fingers sliding in and out.  Oh, just using my lips to spread your lips apart.  Oh, you're going to make me cum.  I'll tilt my head up to make that clit pop out so I can really suck it up in my mouth.  Oh.  Between my tongue and my teeth.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, I'll tilt my finger and curl it up. 
[02:18:00]  Set my finger as deep in your pussy as I can.  Oh.  Start doing the compare motion, trying to find your G-spot.  Oh.  I want to sit the cereal in on your clit, suck your clit into my mouth, and suck your clit  just like you were sucking my cock up there.  Mm-hmm.  With my other hands.  I'll keep squeezing on them titties, kneading them, and pinching the nipples. 
[02:18:30]  Well, now I'll just keep sucking on that cock in and out, deep-throating it until I can  make it explode in my mouth.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Is it feeling good?  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Keep playing with it.  Keep making it feel good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look all around the tip.  Oh, yeah.  Slowly take it all in.  Where'd you go?  These are the top part in and out of the world. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you're going to have my pussy so wet.  Oh, my cock is so hard and dropping.  Oh, I can just feel your mouth on it.  Oh.  Oh, it's your ass up in my face with my tongue up in my pussy.  Oh, if you got it real good and hot, I could bend over and let you shove it in my ass. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, you want me to shove it in your ass?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you like the...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, you like a whore?  Oh, go ahead.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck me with that cock.  Oh, yeah.  I want me to fuck you like a whore up that tight little ass.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you liked it, huh?  Fuck me harder.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Shove my cock up your ass.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, just real slow as I put it in all the way up the balls.  Ooh.  Blow it out where the head's just barely in.  Mm-hmm.  He's in your ass with one hand, tickling your clit with the other.  Mm-hmm.  I'm just rearing back and slapping your ass real hard as I shove my cock in as hard as I can.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  You like that cock up your ass, don't you?  Oh, yes.  Oh, beg me for my cock up your ass.  Oh, yes.  Once you got it in there, just start fucking me with it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Slam it in and out of me until I make that cock explode.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's it.  You got to ask, Jerry. 
[02:21:00]  What?  Oh, just say, Chris, please fuck my ass.  Oh, Chris, please fuck my ass.  Oh, Chris, come on, fuck me.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck me harder, Chris.  Oh, yeah.  I'm pounding my ass, baby.  Oh, oh, yes.  Scoozing your hips, smacking your ass.  Oh, oh.  Oh, don't stop, Chris.  Oh, my ball's slapping against your pussy as my cock fills your ass.  Oh. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You like being my turtile little whore, don't you?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  You're not doing a little bitch, Jerry.  Oh.  Oh, I like the way you make my ass feel.  Oh, yeah.  I like the way your ass makes my cock feel.  Oh. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  It's rather than a bitching.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, I want you to come, Terry.  Mm.  Oh, you're gonna come.  Oh.  Oh, you're gonna make me.  Oh.  Just keep...  I don't know.  Get me real hard.  Oh.  I'm gonna make my slick cock up your ass and make you want to come.  Oh. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Give me three fingers up your pussy.  Oh.  Just pounding your...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Opiate Anthony Party Rock.  All right.  There you have it.  There it is.  The first installment of Tissue Time with Terry. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, Jesus.  He's still going.  He's still...  We gotta finish with him.  All right.  I guess we gotta finish him off.  He was almost ready for the money shot.  Who's gonna do it, Rich?  You have experience with this.  I'm just deep in my ass.  Yeah.  You're fucking my ass.  And my teeth fly out of my head.  Don't mind the bag of garbage over my shoulder.  All right.  They're both gone.  Well, you know, for the first time, that's not bad, Anthony. 
[02:23:30]  It's our brand new bit.  Yes.  Tissue Time with Terry.  I thought that was pretty good.  A lot of people saying Terry sounds like B.R.  Arthur, though.  B.R.  That could be a problem with Tissue Time with Terry.  Jason in Long Island, what's up?  Sounds like fucking B. Arthur giving phone sex.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Rich, I mean, Chris, when is your fucking appointment with Dateline?  Christ.  Yeah, a hot chick will make that work perfectly.  Someone's suggesting it sounded like Tissue Time with Terry Schiavo. 
[02:24:00]  No, that would have been sexy.  Yeah, let's say hi to Cindy in Jersey.  Cindy.  Hey, I want to hear Tissue Time with Tippi Tom.  You want these golden buns?  I'll give them to you, but we got to get up on the stage.  Who can fuck me?  No, that's sexy.  I've been a faggot since day one, and I'll die a faggot.  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.  Let's go into the bathroom, and I'll give you a blowjob. 
[02:24:30]  Well, I'm liking the new bit, Tissue Time.  You know, we're shaking it down, as they say.  It was the shakedown run.  We're not ready to call it Tissue Time with Terry.  I think there might be better broads out there.  Yeah.  We'll find the right girl for it, and she will become the namesake of the bit.  That's right, and this is going to be our new bit.  We like this one.  She was married, too, this girl.  Yeah.  Team player.  Tissue Time.  I think eventually we have a few more new bits we're going to be trying out on the show. 
[02:25:00]  We've been working hard.  Yeah, we have been working hard.  Big time.  We're bringing back the lesbian couch, of course.  Yep, yep.  And a...  What else do we have here?  Let's see.  What we've been working on.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's plenty of good stuff.  We just want to break out one a day, though.  So we'll start with Tissue Time today.  Yeah.  Any other ladies want in?  Tissue Time with Blank.  Give us a call now, okay?  But for the first time, I think it worked pretty well, Anthony.  We'll make you famous.  We'll make you famous. 
[02:25:30]  That's right.  And give your own little hour on the weekends.  How's that sound?  Great.  You know what's awful?  That guy, Chris, right now is finishing up because he can't just stop.  I know.  And he was getting all into it.  And he's got to look at it like laying on his stomach.  He was still on the phone with us with a rod in his hand.  Awkward.  Like, that was fun.  So somewhere in Ass Fuck Itabama, this guy is just jacking.  And he was into the ass, wasn't he? 
[02:26:00]  Tell me, beg for my cock in your ass.  Anthony, we're brilliant broadcasters.  This is what I want to do, okay?  We're going to try out some girls for the rest of the week.  And this Saturday night at midnight, we're going to have the girls come in, especially  if they're local.  Or we can call them up from their abode if they're somewhere in the country.  Because it's phone sex.  We'll have the boys get drunk like they do on Saturday night.  And they'll come in and we'll do a whole tissue time for like an hour.  Tissue time show at night.  Yeah, maybe a two-hour show this weekend on this fine channel on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:26:30]  I like it.  How does that sound?  I like it.  So basically, we'll fill the room with a bunch of girls that want to do phone sex.  And the guys will call in and they'll do it live, okay?  Yep.  You want to try out Michelle real fast before we move on?  Yeah, we can.  Michelle in Baltimore, turn down your radio.  I'll write it down.  Yeah, turn it down because you can listen to this whole thing on the replay, all right?  I can, I know.  All right.  So, Michelle, you're 20 years old from Baltimore, Maryland?  Yep.  Well, you're 20, so you've got to be hot.  Yeah, she's hot. 
[02:27:00]  You could say that, yeah.  Uh-oh.  What's...  I'm a cute girl, nice big tits.  I'm a little bit bigger, but I'm not like, you know, huge or anything, but I can...  She sounds perfect, Anthony.  She does sound perfect.  I can do what I want.  Sounds perfect.  I hate having to do this, but it's all over the country, this show we do.  And some places in the country, a little slower than others.  I think Bowling Green, Kentucky is one.  Yeah.  Danny.  Yeah.  From Bowling Green, Kentucky, yeah, we know.  Get it. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  You can't be this stupid.  Get the joke.  This bit is called getting under someone's skin, something we enjoy doing.  I hate the fact that anything has to be explained, and that's as far as I'm going with an explanation.  We will not explain this one.  From Danny from Bowling Green, yeah, we know, idiot.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  We will not explain this one.  Just figure it out.  All right.  Tissue time with Michelle.  Michelle.  All right. 
[02:28:00]  Perfect voice.  She's 20 years old from Baltimore.  Yeah, but we need a stripper name, though.  Okay.  Michelle.  Dusty Vagina.  How about Candy?  Tissue time with Candy?  Candy.  Yeah.  Tiffany.  Tiffany.  Tiffany.  Tissue time with Tiffany.  No.  Tiffany.  Um, Tiffany.  No, keep going.  Any of the cars?  Porsche, Lexus, Volkswagen?  Oh, yeah.  We've got to go with, yeah.  Taniqua.  With a car.  No.  Rexit.  Rambler.  A rambler.  Well, it's all we've got Edsel on the phone here with you. 
[02:28:30]  Tissue time with Michelle.  All right.  Michelle's a fine name.  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  The girl next door name.  See, when you come up with these brand new bits like we do on a daily basis, you know,  the key thing is to name the bit.  Right.  Perfectly.  So, Tissue time with Michelle is still a little too basic, but we'll figure it out.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Well, we will, but I'll definitely do much better than Tissue time with Terry or Barry  or whatever his name was.  And you're driving right now?  I am.  I'm driving to school.  All right.  You're driving. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, school.  What grade?  Um, the 15th.  15th grade?  Yeah, I'm in college.  You're in college.  All right.  Yeah.  You're a sophomore?  I am a junior.  All right.  We got Michelle.  We got Michelle.  She's a junior in high school, and she wants to do Tissue time with Michelle.  We need a guy.  Now, Michelle, we...  I don't...  Now, I don't want one of those redneck guys.  No.  I don't...  I don't...  And you know what?  The problem with the last bit was that he talked too fucking much.  Right.  And this is Tissue time with whatever the whore's name. 
[02:29:30]  She understands everything that went wrong with the last segment.  You understand.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  So...  Neither could the listeners.  All right.  Would you say Terry was lazy?  Totally lazy.  Oh, yeah.  You know she was just sitting there with a bomb, bomb, bomb.  Yeah, that's good.  Stick it up my ass.  That's wonderful.  It did sound like she had a lozenge or something.  All right, Michelle, we're going to pick someone from a blue state. 
[02:30:00]  That's great.  Yeah, Rusty, get off the couch.  Stick it in my ass.  This girl's 20 and she's on top of everything.  She knows everything.  She's a hot piece of ass, big titties.  And will you be masturbating in your car on the way to high school?  Well, you know, I have a stick shift, so I could probably just jump on over if anything.  And for the guy, you've got to have an orgasm on the air.  Okay, that's fine.  Are you wearing a plaid Catholic school dress?  All right, we're just waiting.  We're screening because we want to get you a good one.  We've got a guy from Kentucky. 
[02:30:30]  That could be a problem.  No, it's a problem.  That is definitely a problem.  Well, I want to see if he's a redneck.  Look at all the people that are named.  Jay?  Yeah.  Well, you don't sound like a redneck.  He said, hey.  How could you tell?  Oh, come on.  I'm good.  Say, speak.  Speak a sentence.  Speak a sentence.  Are you in your car?  I am, actually.  But I've got my dick in hand.  Oh, well, this will be nice.  Oh, he sounds fine.  All right, Jay, I'm not even kidding. 
[02:31:00]  You have to complete, if you can.  Don't worry.  I will blow it all over the windshield.  But if he's driving, that's a problem.  I'm not buying it.  Oh, it adds to the danger.  Pulling a rest area.  We are so dangerous.  This is a very dangerous show.  This is funny.  A lot of comments coming in from doesn't get the bit guy.  It's called getting under someone's skin.  All right, so we're going to do tissue time with Michelle now. 
[02:31:30]  Michelle?  Yes.  All right.  This is your audition, too, because we're going to do a whole two-hour show this Saturday.  I know.  I heard.  Okay.  We're going to be in New York this weekend, so that works out perfectly.  Oh, my God.  This is unbelievable.  Everything's just falling into place.  All right, Jay.  Yeah.  You know, she didn't want a redneck, so you really have to, you know, listen closely and  get the job done, all right?  Don't worry.  And let her do a majority of the work, but you can chime in every so often to maybe make 
[02:32:00]  some suggestions as to what you want her to do.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's about her.  It is a guy's show.  We really need to hear the female voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I'd much rather hear her than hear me.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Michelle?  Yes?  It's tissue time with Michelle.  Michelle, everyone.  All right.  Hey, Jay?  Yes?  What are you doing right now?  I'm stroking my big cock right now.  You're stroking it already?  Well, why don't you let me take care of that for you?  Yeah, we'll do it, baby. 
[02:32:30]  Why don't I start out with my hands stroking all over your body, and then let me move my  way slowly down to your big, hard cock?  Oh, yeah.  Your cock is so fucking hard, because I'm right in front of you.  I'm fucking naked, and my big fucking titties are in your face.  Oh, yeah.  My nipples all hard.  Uh-huh.  Fucking stroking you.  You look amazing.  I'm going to lift my weight down, and I'm going to start to lick slowly all over your cock. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'll lick up and down, and I'll play with the head, and then I'll start to go down to your  balls.  And then I'll put your balls in my house, and I'll stroke your cock with my hand.  Do you like that?  Oh, I love it.  Don't stop.  Does that sound good?  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, then I'll keep doing that.  Yeah?  Does that feel good?  Nice pressure?  That feels great.  Do you like that? 
[02:33:30]  Oh, I love it.  You like the set?  Warm?  Yeah, I bet it makes you think of my fucking pussy, how nice it would be to get it in that  nice little young pussy of mine.  Oh, I'd be so good.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Knock the bottom out of that pussy.  Yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  Wow.  I'm going to keep stroking it.  Yeah.  Right?  Oh, it's so hard.  And I'm going up and down.  Up and fucking down.  Fucking deep throating it.  Slobbering.  Just going at it. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, get it real wet, baby.  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  As wet as my fucking pussy is.  Oh, yeah.  And then I'm going to get on top of you.  He says, what?  Are you getting into it?  Boss is breathing heavy into the mic.  Oh.  Don't stop, baby.  I'm so close.  You got me right there.  It's okay.  I'm going to get on top of you, and I'm going to slide your hard, hard fucking dick into my  tight pussy, you know, because I'm only 20 and it's nice and tight and wet. 
[02:34:30]  And my big cock's going to fill that pussy up.  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  And I'm going to, and then I'm going to slowly slide up and down on your fucking cock.  Going faster.  Faster.  You fucking stop.  Oh, my God.  Your cock feels so fucking good.  Oh, my God.  And I just want you to rub all of my fucking titties, and I want to fucking just, oh, God,  I'm starting to pump.  Oh, yeah.  Pound that cock, baby.  Pound that cock. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  It feels so fucking good.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do you feel good?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I felt great.  Yeah?  I'm done, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Come on, that cock, baby.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I'm fucking putting it up in my face.  Oh, shit. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  I want you to come all over me.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  How about that?  All right, Guy.  Thank you, Jay.  I'm going to move on to Bob in Ohio.  Yes, please.  Bob.  Do I have to do another one?  Yeah.  Well, you were doing it.  Well, let me tell you.  We're working on this.  It's a big, you know, brand new bit, and it's in progress.  Toward the end there, you really started kind of getting into the swing of it.  Yeah.  Because at the beginning, it was a little, as some of the listeners have said, cut and paste,  you know?  Oh, of course.  But you started getting into it. 
[02:36:00]  I think you have a knack for this, a talent.  The guy there, what was his name?  Jay.  Jay, at the beginning, sounded a little like he was sitting at a PowerPoint presentation.  Yeah.  Really, not much energy there and stuff.  But I guess he finished up well with a money shot there.  She got much better as it went along.  Yeah.  Much better.  And Bonnie, yes?  From a female point of view?  I didn't have, I just, I don't know anything about phone, I really would not be good at  it or anything, but just from hearing the two phone calls, I think keeping it present 
[02:36:30]  would be, you know, instead of saying, I would do this to you, just be like, I am doing  this.  Or say, yeah, I'm going to do this.  Yeah, that doesn't work.  It's like, now I'm, or I'm.  I want to imagine that it's happening right now.  As it's happening, not something you're going to do.  Yeah, but the thing is, you have to, you have to speed it up a little bit.  Right.  Because you can't draw it out, you know?  Right.  So it's very, it's hard.  But like, instead of, I'm going to suck your cock, or I'm going to, you know, take your  cock in my, you got to say like, you know, I'm grabbing your cock. 
[02:37:00]  That's right.  Things like that.  I love it.  With the cock.  I love this brand new bit, and I need, I need some help from the pests of this fine  program.  Yeah.  I think all of broadcasts that need to know about this bit, this fine bit we have come  up with today, I think you need to hit the media outlets and tell them that we're doing  this fine bit.  It's not every day that a benchmark bit is born on the Opie and Anthony program.  And I think the pests just need to, you know, spread the word out there to maybe the trade 
[02:37:30]  magazines and John Minnelli at the Post, and I don't know, maybe other broadcasters, so  they know that this bit is already being done.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  You want to try another one, Michelle?  All right.  All right.  It's Bob in Ohio.  Bob?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, can we change your name?  Really?  Oh, yeah, Bob.  Yeah.  Bob.  Carl?  How about, no.  Oh, ooh, ooh.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Carl.  How about, how about, uh...  Wait, maybe Bob has a nickname, Bob.  Ira.  Ramon?  No.  No.  What do you, what names do you like, Michelle?  Mike, Mike is good.  I like, there's a nice good name.  All right.  Mike.  Mike the Rookie.  All right, Mike.  All right, Mike.  Mike's a dirty bitch.  What?  Calling Mike's a dirty bitch.  Oh, okay.  That's another angle.  All right, well, you know, it's just...  Well, if we're going to have a special show this Saturday with Tissue Time,  girls, you know...  She's got to learn. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, she's got to learn.  There's going to be all sorts of different angles these guys are going to take.  From his first line, though, can we change his name to Steve C?  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  Why don't we get going here, Michelle?  Okay.  No problem.  Bob, when you hear Mike, that's you.  Mike is you, Bob.  All right?  All righty.  And you can add to it, but let Michelle do most of the heavy lifting.  Sounds good.  All right.  We want to hear the female.  Let's go, Michelle.  It's Tissue Time with Michelle.  All right.  Hey, Mike.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  Are you there?  Yes.  All right.  Why don't you tell me what you want, baby?  I want it rough.  You want it rough?  You want me to be your little bitch?  You want me to be your little pock-sucking cunt?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Well, why don't I just lay down here, okay?  I'm laying down.  I'm on my stomach.  My ass is in the air.  I'm showing you what I got.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Why don't you grab my ass a little bit?  Oh, slap it. 
[02:39:30]  Grab it hard.  Fucking smack it, because I got a nice big ass.  Big, beefy ass.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  And why don't you get on the bed?  Yeah.  Let me feel your cock behind me.  Oh, yeah.  Let me feel how fucking hard your big fucking cock is.  Right at the spread of your ass.  Let me feel it right on my ass.  Yes.  Oh, God.  I can feel it.  I'm going to spit on the head of it. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you slide that right into my wet fucking pussy?  Yeah.  Put it in.  Oh, God.  Let me feel it.  Oh.  How's that?  Why don't you fucking grab my hair and fucking slam me?  Smack my fucking ass like the dirty little bitch that I am.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck me harder.  Come on, Mike.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh.  Fucking slap me.  And grab me.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, Mike.  Hoo-hoo. 
[02:40:30]  Hoo-hoo, Mike.  Come on.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo, Robert.  Oh, God.  That was great.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Yeah.  Very good there.  Mike, Bob.  100% improved.  Our brand new bit.  Wow.  We love this brand new bit.  It's a quick learner.  Michelle is a quick learner.  That was good.  She adapted to the rougher guy.  Yeah.  I think that guy had Tourette's or something.  He kept saying, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo. 
[02:41:00]  When they were at, when they were at, she said, you smacked my ass.  I'm smacking your ass.  I thought they were the Sklar brothers.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Michelle, we, uh, you're going to be in New York.  You want to do some radio?  Sure.  This is what we do.  All of a sudden, you're like, give me a radio star.  This Saturday night at midnight, we're going to do Tissue Time with Michelle and other  girls.  Okay.  Any other girls out there that want to do Tissue Time, give us a call right now.  Miss Michelle.  All right.  Oh, we got Amanda from Michigan.  I think she wants it.  Michelle, hold on the line.  We're going to give you some info, all right? 
[02:41:30]  Okay, sure.  There goes Michelle.  A ton of guys want to do Tissue Time.  We got another girl that wants to try out to do, uh, to be one of the Tissue Time girls.  Yeah.  I think we should take a break.  Take a leak.  Come on.  Let's do another one.  Come on, guys.  I think we should have two gay bears get each other off.  Come on.  That would sound fucking hilarious.  When you have your own radio show, you can do that best.  What are they talking about?  Tissue Time with hairy back. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, and you have so much hair on your back and on your chest.  Smacking me with your belly.  Your nipple piercing.  All right.  Jesus.  All right.  These guys that are jerking off.  You can actually see your cock.  It is a fantasy call.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program in just a bit.  We'll be right back. 
[02:42:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:43:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:43:30]  Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane in studio.  You guys are going to be playing the Miami Improv, right?  Miami Improv this week and Caroline's Christmas week, the 20th through the 23rd.  Very cool.  That's going to be a very, very good show.  I got to tell you guys something about the song you're hearing in the background.  There's this guy, John Stevens.  He works at XM.  He does a few shifts on Squiz and stuff, I believe.  Or Ethel.  Or both.  I don't know.  He's a rock dude, you know?  Yeah.  And he drove us back to the train station from the XM compound when we were down there for 
[02:44:00]  a couple of days.  And that's his band, Ghost Machine, a song called Headstone.  That's Headstone?  Yeah.  These guys are...  The song's called Headstone.  The band is Ghost Machine.  You might want to check them out when you're checking out music channels on XM.  They do a very, very good job.  Okay?  Come on.  All right.  Rave reviews, Anthony, about Tissue Time.  Oh, yeah.  I think we're onto something here.  Tissue Time with Michelle.  Michelle's still on the line.  And, you know, it's a very interactive radio program. 
[02:44:30]  A lot of people enjoying the bit.  They're suggesting ways to make it even hotter.  Mm-hmm.  And we want to see if Michelle is up to the task here.  All right.  Michelle, you're still on the line?  I am.  I'm here.  And you're going to definitely come in this weekend to do a whole two-hour Tissue Time  thing on our channel?  Yeah.  That is awesome, man.  We've got a bunch of guys that want to listen in again to you.  But here's what we're thinking.  Okay.  We want to see what kind of range you got.  So we want you to talk dirty to another girl. 
[02:45:00]  Okay.  No problem.  You have no problem with that?  No.  Ah, good.  All right.  So we need a female to call in right now.  Hang up on all the guys.  What can I just do with Bonnie?  Well, Bonnie has said she's...  It would just be a little embarrassing for me to masturbate in front of everyone here  at the studio.  It would be cool, but she's like our sister in a way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  Me too.  She's like my sister.  That's a whole other fantasy.  Travis, hang up on all the guys.  We've got to find a girl to see how good Michelle is at this phone sex thing.  It's Tissue Time with Michelle. 
[02:45:30]  Other people are suggesting that you might want to change your name to something hotter.  Sorry.  I apologize.  But the name I was given, I can come up with one, though.  How about, you know what?  I just happen to have a hat, and it's filled with girls' names.  All right.  And I'm just going to reach into the hat and randomly pick one of the names out of the hat.  Okay.  All right?  It's a paper hat. 
[02:46:00]  It's a paper hat.  It's a party hat.  We couldn't afford a lot at the party.  And Bonnie can't do this for you because she's saving her pussy for the money snack.  That's right.  Money Snatch game coming to the Open Anthony program.  We can't wear Bonnie's pussy out too much on this show.  You are listening to the Pioneers of Satellite Radio.  We've done it all, trust me.  I hope no one rips off Money Snatch now.  Well, if they do, they do.  Put it out there.  What can I tell you?  When you're this brilliant, you've got to expect people to rip you off.  How deep is that fucking hat?  I just want to make sure it's fair. 
[02:46:30]  That's true.  All right.  I've got a name in my hand.  Take the paper hat back.  Michelle?  Yes?  We are changing your name to Beth.  No.  Beth, no!  Why?  It's a sexy name.  Yes.  That's a Maria mother name.  No.  It's not a grandma name.  And right when you're doing it, we can start singing, Beth, I hear you coming.  All right.  So it's going to be tissue time with Beth just for this segment.  Okay.  That's fine.  Because we're just switching it up, trying all sorts of different things here, seeing  what works and what doesn't, okay? 
[02:47:00]  We've decided the guy talking too much doesn't really work.  Mm-hmm.  And also the sounds of a guy coming, eh, it doesn't really work.  Yeah.  I know.  How awful is that?  People are like, relax on the having the guys come, Ope.  Yeah.  That's just what I do.  Make it very uncomfortable for everybody.  Yeah.  I like that.  We're looking for a female, so Beth here could do tissue time with Beth. 
[02:47:30]  This girl's a trooper.  She's great.  Absolutely.  Well, you know, it's not a big deal.  All right.  Anything for O&A.  All right.  Travis is trying to find the right girl as we speak.  We have some kind of remix.  Stay on the line there, Beth.  Okay.  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Fuck!  Can you identify that celebrity, by the way?  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  That's a celebrity?  Yeah, that's a celebrity.  Yeah, Bonnie?  Ronnie Bullard.  One more time.  I think I might go.  That's a celebrity.  All right.  He did a sex tape.  It's him, obviously, during the money shot.  Mm-hmm.  And here he is.  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Webster.  Webster.  It's not Webster.  Is it The Rock?  I'm going to go for Tommy Lee.  No, no.  Not Tommy Lee and not The Rock.  Can you have a hint? 
[02:48:30]  I can't.  I get it.  Pat from Menachie.  A hint?  Let's see.  Usually plays a gruff guy.  Been in a couple of military movies.  Oh, Tommy Lee Jones.  No.  Sylvester Stallone.  You got the Tommy right, though.  Little hint.  Tommy.  Oh, no.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  No.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy Chong.  No.  No.  Wait.  Hold on.  Tom.  Come on.  It sounds familiar. 
[02:49:00]  I mean.  He was in Saving Private Ryan.  That's right.  Tommy Hanks.  Tom Hanks.  No.  Tom Hanks is in...  Motherfucker.  He wasn't in Saving Private Ryan.  Yeah.  But Tom Hanks didn't put out...  How would we get...  Yeah.  He didn't do a porno, Rich.  That would be a little bigger news than this one was.  He might do it.  He should dress up like a boy.  I'm not saying he's an A-list celebrity.  I'm saying he's, you know...  You'd know who he was.  Right.  But...  Oh.  Oh.  Did he date Heidi...  Heidi Flights. 
[02:49:30]  Heidi Flights.  I don't know his name.  Tom...  Tom...  Perrincher.  Tom Perrincher.  Oh.  What happened?  You poked yourself in the eye?  No.  No.  No.  It makes sense now.  What's his name?  Michelle, do you know who it is?  No.  I can't think of Michelle.  Oh.  It just made sense to her.  I got it.  I'm seeing it.  Yeah.  It is Tom Sizemore.  Tom Sizemore.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Here's...  Didn't he have Seth and Clarence Hilton?  Did he?  He claims to.  What a guy.  Didn't everybody? 
[02:50:00]  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem we're having right now.  There are so many guys calling in to play Tissue Time with Michelle slash Beth.  Yeah.  We're having a tough time finding a woman at this moment in time.  Just get one of the guys to use the falsetto.  Oh, wait.  We might have a Stephanie on the line finally.  We might have got one that got through.  We're hoping.  All right.  Let's see what Stephanie's all about.  Stephanie.  Yes.  Hi, Stephanie.  How are you?  I'm pretty good.  Do you like our new bit?  Yes, I do.  All right.  It's Tissue Time with Michelle.  My cue from Cleveland doesn't get anything. 
[02:50:30]  Are you a lesbian there, Stephanie?  I'm actually bisexual.  Bisexual.  So you would get into a little phone sex with another female, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I guess at this point, obviously, both girls could talk a lot, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And we want to see if Michelle's really good at this phone sex thing.  So we're giving her...  She had the normal guy, pretty much.  Then she had the guy that was a little rough, wanted a little rougher.  And now we got Stephanie on the line, who's a chick. 
[02:51:00]  Isn't it strange how Tissue Time with Robert Reed would be totally different?  Just be like him on the phone sniffling and blowing his nose and calling a friend.  All right.  Michelle.  Yes.  Okay.  We're changing your name for this segment.  Beth.  It's Tissue Time with Beth.  And we want you, in this phone call, to be very submissive and say stuff like,  it's all about you.  Okay.  And, you know, we do what Stephanie wants. 
[02:51:30]  Let Stephanie do that.  All right.  Sure.  All right.  Stephanie, you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  It's Tissue Time with Beth, featuring Michelle playing the part of Beth.  And Stephanie from New York.  Let's listen in.  And we want real orgasms, ladies.  None of those fake ones.  Okay.  All right.  Stephanie?  Yes.  Are you there, sweetie?  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah?  All right.  Well, this is all about you, baby.  And I just want to please you. 
[02:52:00]  I just want to feel you come all over me.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Sorry to interrupt.  That's a good idea.  Our listeners are really helping us out today.  And we're the directors of this brand new bit that's sweeping satellite radio as we speak.  The media already picking up on this.  All right.  So Michelle's playing the part of Beth, I believe.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  So that's good.  We have no problem with that.  But people are suggesting that we change Stephanie's name, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Wait.  I got the paper hat back to my hands. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Gee, I wonder what name it's going to be.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  There's so many names in there.  Like 150 girl names in there.  All right.  And I'm so curious as to see what this one is.  Holy crap.  What a strange coincidence.  Stephanie?  Yeah?  Your name is...  What?  People talk about this all the time.  You could say it.  You could blow up the eighth wall and just tell everybody. 
[02:53:00]  I had to make believe I had the name in my hand.  I know.  You're miming like...  Oh, he's reading it.  He's reading it.  I'm reading it.  See?  I actually believed it was there.  Stephanie?  Yes?  Your new name is Allison.  Allison?  Yes.  Allison.  That's my mother's name.  I can't do that.  Oh, my God.  You're wrecking...  No, see?  You have to do that.  You have to.  Okay, fine.  Fine, professional.  You're going to wreck the greatest bit of all time if you don't play along. 
[02:53:30]  I'm sorry about it.  Trust me.  So, Michelle, you are Beth, so it's Tissue Time with Beth featuring Allison from...  What a coincidence, New York.  All right.  Start over, guys.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, it's fine.  Allison?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm here.  Call each other by your first names a lot during this, by the way.  Okay?  Okay, no problem.  All right.  We're just trying different angles here.  All right.  Tissue Time with Beth.  Okay. 
[02:54:00]  Allison?  Yeah, Beth?  You're laying down on the bed.  Yeah?  And I'm on top of you, slowly kissing you down your body, your neck, slowly taking your  clothes off.  Now I'm rubbing on your nice, perky, big tits.  Oh, yeah.  Lay with your nipples with my tongue, flick back and forth, sucking on them, making you  feel how nice it is to have my mouth all over you. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to slowly, slowly move my weight down, down towards your pussy, your nice, shaved,  wet pussy.  And I'm going to kiss all over, and tease licking on your lips, feeling you tremble underneath  of me.  Then let's slowly start to lick your pussy.  Oh, my God.  You do so good.  Oh. 
[02:55:00]  Oh.  It feels so good.  Mm.  Licking and sucking on your clit while I use my fingers to penetrate you.  Oh, I like that.  You feel it a little bit.  Yeah?  You like that, sweetie?  Oh, and I just want to make you feel so good.  Oh.  You taste so good, and you're so wet.  Oh, God.  Your clit is getting nice and hard, yeah?  Yeah.  Just licking fast and fast.  Oh, God.  I can feel it.  Oh.  Mm. 
[02:55:30]  Mm.  And then I'm going to pull out my vibrator.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  While I'm still licking on your clit.  Uh-huh.  And I got one finger.  Playing with your ass.  Do you like that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Feel good?  Oh, yeah.  Mm.  Oh.  Oh, God.  You're so lit.  Mm.  I'm just slowly eating you out.  Mm.  Your pussy is so nice and so fucking wet.

You like the way the vibrator feels going in and out?  Oh, yeah.  It's hung on your clit.  Yeah?  Tell me how it feels.  Oh, yes.  Tell me how it feels, Allison.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Oh.  Mm.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I want nothing more than feel you cum.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Mm.  Oh, yes.  I'm reaching up and grabbing your big breath.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.

Oh, Allison.  You want me to like your pussy?  Mm. 
[02:57:30]  Yes.  Please.  Oh, yeah.  Please, baby.  Please.  Oh, I'll circle your clit with my tongue.  Oh, yeah.  And I'll put my tongue deep inside your pussy.  Oh, God, yes.  And I'll lick up all those juices.  Come on, fucking baby.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  You taste so good.  Oh, my God.  Your fucking mouth feels amazing.  Oh, yeah, Beth.  Oh.  Oh, Allison.  Mm.  Mm.  Oh.  Are you going to cum in my mouth for me?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to cum all over your face, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Allison.

[02:58:30]  Let's hear it for Beth and Allison.  Oh, yes.  Come on.  Wonderful.  Loving this tissue time.  Can I just say how much Michelle improved since the first year?  Really?  Yeah.  Three calls, and she's a pro now.  Amazing.  That's right.  A pro.  That's right.  The thing is, I'm not driving anymore, and I'm in the parking lot, so I actually can, you  know, play with myself while I'm doing this.  Wow.  Were you touching yourself during that, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that sounded really good.  Did you cum?  Um, no.  No. 
[02:59:00]  Sorry.  That was really good.  Wow.  That's okay.  The feedback is going nuts.  People really love this brand new bit.  Tissue time with Michelle.  Mm-hmm.  I like it.  Thank you, Michelle.  No problem.  Stephanie, thank you so much.  Yeah, thank you.  You guys were great.  I think we're going to do this new bit a lot in the next few weeks.  I know.  I'm going to do it later.  You're doing it on TV right now.  I'm doing it.  All right.  There they go, Michelle and Stephanie.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And we'll try out more women, because we're going to do a whole tissue time show. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I see people on hold that want to get on, but we'll have to wait.  It looks like Robin and Jackie, those two girls are going to have to wait for their turn.  Maybe next time.  Oh, wow.  Rave reviews on the new bit.  Oh, of course.  They love it.  Thank you.  Best bit ever.  And once again, the PES, please spread the word and let others know that we're doing this great bit.  It's brilliant.  Thank you.  Our PES have a way of getting us into the press.  I'm glad I was here during the groundbreaking of this bit. 
[03:00:00]  This bit is going to go down.  Places like Inside Radio, fmqb.com, rronline.com, New York Radio Message Board, allaccess.com,  John Minnelli at the Post, might want to tell the people at KROQ.  You get the idea.  I don't.  Huh?  So many people that are Don't Get the Bit guy.  Really?  Yeah.  That's too bad.  That is.  It's too bad.  Listening to something and really just not even being able to understand it. 
[03:00:30]  That's too bad.  I kind of feel sorry for the guy that spanked it out in the morning because there's nothing  worse than jerking off in the morning because the rest of the day is shot.  The whole day you've got to walk around thinking to yourself, I already jerked off and people  know it.  You know, you have nothing.  You can't do it again until after.  You can't do it twice in one day.  Well, Rich, that's where you're wrong.  There are.  Wait, you can't do it twice in one day?  Jerk off more than once in one day?  Fuck yeah.  Are you serious?  How old are you?  No, I can do it physically, but mentally you don't want to do it more than once in a 
[03:01:00]  day.  Why not?  Are you serious?  You jerk off more than once in a day.  Oh, I'm not really jerking off, but whatever.  I can have sex more than once in a day.  I haven't proven it yet.  You haven't proven it yet.  Yeah, because Bonnie just gave it a look.  He's holding that gem back, Bonnie.  See, like once with Bonnie and once with the garbage man doesn't, you know.  Yeah.  All right, sure, technically it's twice, but it's...  I don't know. 
[03:01:30]  Let's go to Melissa in Philly.  Say hi to Melissa.  Hey, Melissa, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Very good.  Good.  I was just calling to say thank you.  Why?  Well, I'm at work today, and I had to run out for a minute, and I turn on my satellite,  and I find myself touching myself on behalf of Tissue Time.  Ah, people are loving Tissue Time.  Yeah, that's the whole idea of the bit, giving our faithful listeners some pleasure out there.  Yeah, and I'm thinking work sucks, and I have to go back to it, but suddenly I really don't care. 
[03:02:00]  It's all okay.  See, that's why this is such a great radio show.  Thank you, Melissa.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.  All right, and they're coming in like crazy.  Greg in California.  Greg?  Hey, this bit is just astounding.  Why hasn't anybody in radio done this before?  Well, you know, we pride ourselves on working hard and coming up with bits that are original.  That's right.  And fun for the listeners.  That's right.  And I think we hit a home run with this one.  And unfortunately, I think this is one of those bits that is so good that it'll be ripped 
[03:02:30]  off all over the country, but at least people will know who did it first, you know?  That's awesome.  It's given me such a rod this morning.  I love it.  Oh, cool.  Thanks, Greg.  Well, I don't know if the rod part's cool, but I'm glad that you're happy.  Punch it out.  All right.  There you go.  Anthony, we got a puke remix from the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, he just took the headphones off.  I saw that.  A puke remix.  Yeah, they're starting to come in.  People are taking the puke sound effects, and they're doing some stuff with it.  A guy named Joe. 
[03:03:00]  We don't even know if this is good.  I hope so.  Joe from Boundbrook, New Jersey.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, I used to live there.  I used to have a place in Boundbrook.  Drew Boogie has set the bar pretty high for anybody that attempts to do a remix.  He's a genius, and I can't wait until he gets a hold of some of the puke audio and makes  his remix.  But in the meantime, we'll suffer through with an amateur.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  Let's hear.  Here's the deal.  Basically, we got to take 15 guys.  They're all going to do a double shot of eggnog every minute until they puke. 
[03:03:30]  They puke, they're out of the contest.  Simple as that, okay?  Make me want to drink.  Make me want to drink.  Make me want to drink.  Dude, there's not an eggnog coming out of your nose.  Oh, that gurgling was fantastic. 
[03:04:00]  Some of the best puke audio I've ever heard.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Hey, man, that's not bad.  All right, that's not bad.  That's a good place to start with the puke remixes.  Yeah, definitely.  That's really not bad at all.  Good job there, Joe, from Boundbrook, New Jersey.  All right.  All right, enough.  We know we're great.  Andy, New Hampshire?  I'll just pull something else out of your ass. 
[03:04:30]  That whole tissue time is classic.  Oh, thank you, Andy.  I greatly appreciate it.  Hey, you know what?  I just found this video online, the one with the t-shirt on the street and you guys yelling  at the guy.  Oh, yeah.  That's some funny shit right there.  Oh, cool.  Oh, that video's up on opandanthony.com when we're yelling at the janitor and stuff?  I didn't find it on ONA.  I found it on another scab site, but I just happened to see it and I heard the voices.  I'm like, I know who that is.  And then you guys yelling at me.  That was funny.  And the janitor...  What website?  I think it was like geckogkko.com. 
[03:05:00]  Okay.  I found it on there and I'm like, oh, I've never heard that one before.  All right.  Awesome.  Thank you, Andy.  We're going to do some more of that shit.  That's good stuff.  Yeah, definitely.  You know what we're going to do?  Because we know this thing is going to, you know, I think other guys are going to try  this bit.  We're going to do tissue time a lot in the next few weeks.  Can you get this like somehow patent or copyrighted?  We tried with WoW and it didn't really work.  No.  You can't do it?  Radio is just a vast wasteland where you can pick and choose from other people.  What we do is we'll just do it a lot in the next few weeks. 
[03:05:30]  So if anyone else really does do it, it...  Everybody will know it's yours.  Yeah.  And at that point, people would be like, I've heard this before.  Whatever, man.  You do it in...  Yeah.  So I think we'll do it for at least a month.  I'll get my bumper stickers copyrighted in my news.  I Know the Struggle bumper stickers.  It's going to make me a million.  It's like that Get Her Done.  I Know the Struggle.  Right.  They're coming.  I Know the Struggle.  You're just brilliant, Rich.  I'm telling you.  It scares me.  But you go into Kmart and you say, I know the Struggle t-shirts in Kmart. 
[03:06:00]  You'll see.  I'm telling you.  I will see.  My brother could design the shirt for you.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a great graphic artist or whatever.  Oh, cool.  We got Opie and Anthony t-shirts for sale for Christmas on opianthony.com if you're looking  for that special gift.  Is it a Christmas type shirt?  No, not really.  Christmas themed?  No.  A bunch of our shirts are available and you can buy them in time for Christmas.  That's a good idea.  If you're looking for a present for someone that's a fan of the show, go to opianthony.com. 
[03:06:30]  Remember we had Dennis Leary in here?  Yes.  And he had his band and they sang and it was great.  We had a lot of fun.  And he was doing that Christmas special on Comedy Central.  Yeah, I guess that's running a thousand times on Comedy Central.  I finally took a peek and some funny stuff is going on on that special.  You've got to check it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Real funny stuff.  I just want to play a clip from the show.  It's William Shatner.  He got William Shatner to do a little bit for the show.  Yes, he did.  And you know how every year you get, you know, letters to Santa? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, is this the video?  I'm seeing if it is.  All right, all right.  Sorry.  You know, letters to Santa and stuff.  Well, William Shatner sits down in front of a bunch of kids that aren't appreciative of their Christmas gifts.  And sits him down and starts reading some letters that Santa got.  Some letters from some less fortunate kids.  Less fortunate children, yes.  So it was a very serious part of the Christmas special.  So here's William Shatner sitting down with the kids and reading some letters to the kids. 
[03:07:30]  Dear Santa, my village was bombed and we live in a refugee camp.  And the only thing I want for Christmas is an end to all suffering and for everyone in the world to stop fighting and get along.  Fatima Hishman.  What a wuss. 
[03:08:00]  Meet another one.  All right.  Dear Santa, my dad lost his job.  And our entire family lives in an abandoned Mazda Navajo.  We all have TB.  We have to wear clothing we've stolen from other homeless people.  We all share our blanket between us and keep warm by rubbing the rats against our skin. 
[03:08:30]  Well, at least they have pets.  What losers.  Shatner.  How great is that?  He did this on his special?  Yeah.  That's funny.  They got away with a lot of stuff, man.  I love how you get a hold of William Shatner and he'll do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shatner, we need you.  We're doing a song and we want you to sing on it.  Okay.  Yes, I'm there. 
[03:09:00]  Well, he's one of these guys.  I want you to do a special.  Sorry, go ahead.  No, I don't want you to sit down and read some Christmas letters there.  Yes, I'll be there.  I was going to say, he's one of these celebrities that doesn't take himself seriously.  Maybe we can get a problem with that.  Do tissue time with Shatner.  With Shatner.  Not a bad idea.  All right.  You want to go over Rich Voss' stand-up stuff?  No, you should wait until Norton.  It's an all appearance on, you want to wait until we get the whole gang?  Yeah, because I think that's roast material.  That's, you know, it's like. 
[03:09:30]  Well, we got Patrice.  Yeah, it might just be sad.  Because why couldn't we do it both times?  A little now.  No, because.  All right, here's the deal.  Can you come in another day this week?  Because we got Patrice for the rest of the week.  You can come in for a segment.  I can only, no, because tomorrow, because we're going, we're leaving Wednesday.  Oh, no, we're leaving Wednesday afternoon.  We can come in Wednesday morning.  So you come in Wednesday and we'll do, you come in later in the show so you can sleep in.  And then we'll do it with Patrice when he's here.  All right.  Bonnie? 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Bonnie's just embarrassed by the whole thing.  Are you?  I'm just embarrassed by the look.  I want to bring in Bonnie's sitcom with her and Adam Ferraro.  He did a sitcom together.  Ferraro?  Ferraro.  He always says people's names wrong.  Who?  And he wants people that he's just known as well.  Ferraro.  It's Ferraro.  Ferraro, Ferraro.  You know how it's called.  Ferraro.  It's hard not to make fun of you, Rich.  I said I'm not going to make fun of you this show. 
[03:10:30]  Ferraro.  That's an arrow?  But then your teeth are falling out.  You're pronouncing people's names wrong.  Yeah, that's a good line.  Here's the thing.  What show was that?  It was called Social Studies on UPN.  Oh, my God.  You were in that?  I was the star of that show.  You were?  Six episodes.  You were in Social Studies?  Yeah.  I remember that.  We pushed that show hard.  Because Adam's a good friend of, well, childhood friend of Anthony's, whatever, a friend of  Anthony's and myself, and we pushed hard when that hit the airwaves. 
[03:11:00]  She was the star.  You were the one.  It was awful.  I cried every day in my trailer.  Why?  Because I didn't realize, you know, it was like I went on one audition and I got the show,  and I didn't know, I didn't really want to be an actor, and I didn't know how hard it  is for people to get shows, so I didn't appreciate it.  And it was really bad, and it was poorly written.  It was really bad.  And I was embarrassed to say, I didn't tell my friends that I was on it.  They were like, we found out you're on a show. 
[03:11:30]  And I was like, oh.  Oh, yeah.  I had this, I remember one time walking down the, and I also had to wear dresses, and I  never, at that point in my life, I was such a tomboy, I never wore a dress, and I had my  hair done, and makeup, and this dress on, and I was playing the part of a teacher, and  I saw someone I knew on the lot, and I was so embarrassed.  Yeah, but you're on a lot, you're playing your characters while you're dressed like that.  I was getting paid $20,000 a week, and I was complaining constantly, constantly. 
[03:12:00]  They must have thought I was a total asshole, which I guess I was, I was, but I didn't  know it was going to be that hard to get another show.  Adam was the gym teacher.  Yeah.  It was set in a school, and what was the whole, like, gist?  Was there, like...  Was that, like, I was more of a kid than the students or something?  It was like a boarding school, and I'd gone there, and...  You were kind of mischievous.  Yeah, and I was always having problems with the headmistress, and...  Ooh, really? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, I mean, just...  Any, uh...  Did that lead to anything?  Phone sex?  No.  Did you, like, during photo shoots, you were giving a...  Oh, and during photo...  This is how immature I was.  During photo shoots for press, you know, to do press, I would try to get...  Give the finger in every picture somehow.  So it was kind of in there?  Yeah.  To fucking grow up and realize this little pot of gold was handed to you?  When she first was in the business, like, the first couple years, she got, like, a big deal  for a couple hundred grand, a TV show, right? 
[03:13:00]  She was loaded.  She's living with some guy who's a comic, who's a guitar act, he's got...  Right?  Just drained her for everything, right?  She spent...  I bought him a car.  I mean her.  Oh, my God.  I meet her.  She doesn't have a fucking TV.  She doesn't have a broke Bonnie.  She doesn't have a TV, a VCR.  I came to her house for the first time.  She bought an ironing board because she thought I liked to iron from fucking last time I was  standing in the dummy.  And I got to get the broke Bonnie, all right?  I get the broke Bonnie.  Yeah, but you know what?  I had a sense of self. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  That's what you got.  You had earned your bones, man.  That's right.  But she has a sense of humor.  But, you know, on the show...  You don't have a dime one from that shit, do you?  No, I...  You saved nothing.  You know, when all the money ran out, I left the boyfriend.  I finally figured it out.  Left him and started scraping my way back.  He never paid one...  I lived with him for five years and he never paid one month's rent.  Tell him about the birthday or Christmas present.  Oh, this is great.  It's so funny. 
[03:14:00]  This is when I started to figure maybe...  Uh-oh.  You know, he was not a good gift giver.  And, uh...  Well, first of all, I had a little kitten that I'd found on the street and I fell in love  with it, you know.  And I...  That always makes a boyfriend happy.  ...tried to get this cat to come back to health.  But, you know, after like four months, I took it to his vet.  After vet, after vet, I couldn't...  They said, you know, you have to put your cat down.  And it was awful.  Like, so...  It was horrible.  And, uh...  So my boyfriend, he used his credit card to pay for that because I couldn't... 
[03:14:30]  It was like the one time he paid for anything.  I couldn't do it.  I was like a wreck.  Blood, money.  Yeah.  So three weeks...  Two or three weeks later was my birthday and he didn't get me a present.  And, um...  I said...  Oh, no.  He didn't get me anything for my birthday.  He goes, oh, I had your cat put to sleep.  How do you wrap that up with a bow?  What a creep.  Boy, I was...  It wasn't a tough act for me to follow.  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Jesus Christ.  And, you know, so I blow a guy by the garbage can.  Big deal.  At least I get her presents.  That chia pet is looking really good now, huh?  Yeah.  I put your cat just...  You must have looked like a knight.  Sweeping her off her feet after that.  What a creep.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then I left shortly after that.  Yeah, shortly.  Not right then and there.  I know.  That's great.  All right.  We have the NAB spots.  We should get to a few of these.  Yeah, see what their big major malfunction is with satellite radio? 
[03:15:30]  Well, you know, commercial radio, regular radio, terrestrial radio.  It's been called all those things.  Very scared about...  I like to call it shit.  Satellite radio.  Satellite radio, obviously, you know, taking off.  It's as simple as that.  It's taking off.  And they're scared.  So the NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters, got together and they got a huge ad campaign  basically telling people you shouldn't have to pay for it.  Right.  Just playing right into our hands.  They do this. 
[03:16:00]  They go to every political thing.  Whenever a committee gets together to regulate radio in any way, shape, or form,  the first thing they do is get up and start whining that,  well, they don't have to do it.  Satellite doesn't have to, so why should we?  And if you say we have to, then satellite should have to also.  Right.  No.  It doesn't work that way.  People pay for this.  People pay...  I know it's very hard to believe.  People are paying for this program.  And the biggest mistake these guys are doing, and they're supposed to be, you know, 
[03:16:30]  the most intelligent broadcasters out there,  they're turning more people onto satellite radio because the reality is more people don't know about satellite radio than do.  Yeah.  Even though the business is growing, like, you know, leaps and bounds and all those cliches you would use.  Heard that meeting with ELO, too.  There's still more people that don't know about satellite radio.  Did he show you their name recognition chart and graph in his office?  Here it is.  When people are asked, do they know about satellite radio?  Just any satellite radio.  So they should just do what they do? 
[03:17:00]  The recognition factor of 3.11568.  And then, do you know the name of the satellite radio company?  And now the recognition...  Look at the graph and the chart and shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I want to leave.  Get me back to the hotel.  So...  Still something in the minibar.  So they got these commercials running all over the place.  Mm-hmm.  And they're just playing into our hands.  Let's listen to a couple of these.  Two outlasts to the ninth.  Bases loaded.  Here's Santos.  He's 0 for 4 today.  269 hitter for the year.  We could be going into extra innings here. 
[03:17:30]  I agree.  Here's the pitch to Santos.  Fastball hit in the air.  Deep down the left field line.  It's headed toward the pole.  That ball is...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some things were just meant to be free.  Holy shit.  These are better than I even thought.  That is really funny, though.  First of all, the guy's acting stinks.  Yeah.  We might be going to extra innings. 
[03:18:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I like the please deposit there.  That's kind of funny.  That is funny.  We came up with a funny little idea.  But you don't lose your service in the middle of a...  No.  ...very important baseball game.  It's not like...  You know what you're paying for, and you're paying to get that game, the game you want  to hear.  That's right.  Regardless of where you live, whatever fan you are of whatever team, you can get that  game.  So you're not paying for the same thing you're getting on free radio.  I believe they're not being honest.  Gee.  Because they're not...  I think you're right. 
[03:18:30]  Because they're not telling the people that are listening to commercial radio that you  can get any baseball game.  Right.  Not just the stupid local one.  Not just the local one.  Any ball game.  Any ball game.  And tissue time.  Right.  And of course we offer tissue time.  That's right.  Here's another one.  Shocking news in the world of heavy metal.  One of the hardest bands on the planet is about to release a children's record.  Songs slated to appear on the album include A Tiskit A Tasket, Hey Diddle Diddle, and  The Hokey Pokey.  Let's listen to a sneak preview. 
[03:19:00]  Here's Rear on the Rosie performed by the one and only...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some  things were just meant to be free.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  But see, you're paying because you have to run all those commercials.  So the listeners are paying.  Right.  Right.  They're paying.  They have to sit through 20-minute commercial.  They're paying with their time.  How about this?  We have traffic and weather coming up right after... 
[03:19:30]  If you have a tumor...  The brain, neck, chest, head, or ankle.  Nipples.  Stereotactic radio surgery can cure your tumors.  If your child has leukemia, please call us.  That's what you get on regular radio.  If you have tumors of the big toe.  Tumors of the toe.  Toenail.  Toenail fiber.  Ear lobe.  The webbing of your hands.  What?  Tumor of the brow line, the cheekbone, or a nostril. 
[03:20:00]  So, I mean, stop.  They're looking pretty silly because, first of all, they're playing a lot of commercials,  which is just death.  And they're also playing a very, very tight playlist.  Yeah.  The heavy metal channels on satellite radio give you more variety and no commercials.  You're paying with your time.  That's right.  That you're sitting there agonizing through commercials.  Hollywood is abuzz with gossip.  Guess which $20 million leading man has finally decided to come out of the closet? 
[03:20:30]  Once one of Tinseltown's most eligible bachelors, he's about to reveal the personal life he's  been hiding from fans for years.  Think you know who I'm talking about?  Uh-uh.  It's veteran stage and screen actor, please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some  things were just meant to be free.  See, first of all, it's Tom Cruise.  But these pussies don't even have the balls to go with the big... 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, go with that.  We might get sued.  We might get sued.  So, let's start the name as...  Yeah.  So, you're thinking Brian...  So, we don't get sued because Tom's people get in charge of...  ...in touch with us, and then we're going to get in big trouble.  So, even though we're putting these spots out to say how cool we are...  And that's why commercial radio sucks.  That's why it's free.  They don't take any chances whatsoever.  We'll say Tom Cruise is a fag.  We'll say.  That's right.  But they had to go with the b...  So, there's no doubt that they were maybe going to tease you and say it was Tom Cruise.  A b... 
[03:21:30]  Oh, De Niro's good friend, Tom Cruise.  Oh, God.  These are great.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing  a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior...  No, why you can't describe it on the radio?  Yeah.  Because it's not satellite radio.  Of course, you can't describe it on the radio.  Stupid idiots.  Why would they put that in their commercial?  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[03:22:00]  So good we can't describe it.  Yeah, yeah.  Tommy Lee pulled his cock out and bludgeoned the woman in the front row with it.  That's right.  What dopes?  That's what you could say on satellite radio.  No beep, beep, beep.  No.  This is why people are fleeing commercial radio, you dopes.  Wait, I got to hear that part again.  That's a good one.  It's so outrageous, we can't even tell you.  Well, guess what?  On satellite radio, we can give you all the intimate details right after tissue time.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing 
[03:22:30]  a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal or rap stars, but this time, the guilty  party is none other than the easy listening sensation...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Are they...  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some things  were just meant to be free.  Clay Aiken, by the way.  How stupid are they? 
[03:23:00]  Stuck it in a young boy's ass.  They are so stupid.  That is, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You're pretending you're...  They're pretending that...  That you get everything that satellite radio gives you.  Yeah.  That's what they're pretending.  They're like, we give you everything that satellite radio is giving you, but it's for free.  No, you're not, because you won't even describe the lewd act.  They should cut it off after she says we can't even describe it, and then you have the same  guy going, but you can hear it on XM satellite radio.  But aren't they saying that's XM, because then you have to pay for it to hear it? 
[03:23:30]  So they don't even get what XM is.  No.  That's how stupid they are.  They're all panicky about it.  They're just stupid.  We can't even...  Oh, wait, we can.  We're XM.  You have to pay for it, but we can describe what the lewd act is.  Let's take television and do the same exact thing.  Take a movie, a fun movie like Goodfellas or something.  There's the scene.  They're playing cards.  Spider gets shot.  It's like, wait, what the, what the, what the... 
[03:24:00]  All right, you got to pay for HBO, but at least you're going to see the fucking movie  the way it's supposed to be shown.  Not like they'll show it on NBC.  At this point, I just watch HBO.  The shows are just so much better than regular shit.  I sat through Jurassic Park on the sci-fi channel.  Why do you do that to yourself?  Because I'm a glutton for punishment.  And at the beginning of the movie, Carropia and Andy, they let it roll for an hour straight  without a commercial.  And you just sit there and a commercial comes up and you go, oh, wow, they haven't been 
[03:24:30]  a commercial in a long time.  This is great.  By the end, it's like, oh, my God, back to a commercial.  Back to a commercial.  But you know on American Movie Channel, and there's another one, too, that late at night,  they don't put any commercials.  But that's still cable.  You still have to have cable.  Yeah, but they don't put any...  But it's weird.  But they cut the language out.  No.  I don't think they did.  I've seen on AMC, I've seen Smokey and the Bandit on there, which is ridiculous because  isn't it American Movie Classics? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  And they're showing Smokey and the Bandit.  We now serve up a fine classic starring Burt Reynolds.  American Movie Crap.  That's why I hate Network.  Nominated for no Academy Award.  Network.  I'm watching Prison Break every week.  Critically acclaimed.  All right, back to these commercials.  They're just doing a horrendous job.  They're embarrassing.  Taking a quick look at sports, baseball is rocked by scandal. 
[03:25:30]  As three all-stars have tested positive for a new designer steroid that was previously  undetectable.  Rather than face suspension, all three plan to announce their retirements.  No names have been officially released, but sources say they are outfielder...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by...  And how about for your quarter?  For your 25 cents?  You don't just get that asshole telling you about it.  You get the fucking ballplayers on actually talking about the steroid scandal. 
[03:26:00]  You get stars of the game telling you about it.  You have Jose Canseco saying how he shoved needles in other guys' asses.  Right.  That's what you get for the...  What are they trying to pull?  They're so stupid.  This is the worst campaign.  I would...  I swear, I tried to have an open mind, and I would give due credit if they came up with  an angle that was like, all right, they're kind of defending themselves, and it's working.  This is garbage. 
[03:26:30]  They're proving satellite's point.  Yeah.  Time for traffic.  All right.  We have bad news if you're on the road.  An overturned tractor-trailer is causing major gridlock.  Cleanup crews are trying to remove the wreckage, and traffic is backed up for nearly 12 miles.  If you don't want to be stuck in your car all day, make sure you absolutely avoid...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  4.95.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it. 
[03:27:00]  I wish I could get shot.  I know it's 4.95.  All right, look.  It always is.  If there was a 12-mile backup at that point, you would already know.  Yeah.  You just would know.  And XM has traffic for all the big cities, so if you live in New York City, I could turn  on theirs without having to listen to...  I am Ted Tudai BD, but we go to the North Shore Medical Clinic.  You two.  It's a family atmosphere of help and support for you and your loved ones. 
[03:27:30]  If they have leukemia or cancers of the throat, larynx, inner canal, the eardrum, the coccyx.  You have cancer of the coccyx?  The yambag.  Cancer?  What the?  You got cancer in a yambag?  That sounds like an issue.  Come to the hospital, and we'll cut it out for you.  We don't got no special stereophonic surgery. 
[03:28:00]  But maybe you can watch me in force fuck each other in the ass.  You're not getting that.  No, you don't get that.  There is traffic, and you don't have to wait for their time for the traffic.  You tune in.  It's on a loop.  You're going to get it.  And I know XM does a wonderful job with the traffic, but I've never been a believer of  traffic on the radio.  It's never...  It has never helped me.  It is almost impossible to quickly tell you where a traffic jam is.  I'll be sitting in traffic that, I swear to you, should be top priority. 
[03:28:30]  Fuck announcing it on traffic.  It should be the top story on the news channel I'm listening to.  It's that bad.  Oh, there's wreckage all over the roadway.  And you know, the traffic guy gets on, and he's like...  Well, all the bridges and tunnels are clear.  Yeah.  It's like, why are you announcing what's clear first?  How about run through the traffic shit first?  Like, oh my God, Anthony is so inconvenienced right now.  Right.  He's freaking out.  Here's traffic.  Remember yesterday?  Well, it's the fucking same today.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But you know, and the difference, too, is, you know, with regular radio, if you miss 
[03:29:00]  somebody like Scott and Todd or two guys, you can't go home that night and hear them  again.  Right.  XM, you get the replay.  Replays.  Replays, you know.  You don't have to convince the people that are listening, Rich.  Oh, that's right.  They already know.  I'm disagreeing.  They're listening.  We're just giving them a peek at what regular radio is trying to do to combat what we're doing.  I know there's some people that are listening that don't have it.  Now, I'm going to.  What?  We were in the mall, and they were saying how XM was flying off the tables at the mall. 
[03:29:30]  Or shelves.  It was actually a table.  It really was a table.  They actually have just tables set up.  Yeah.  They did have tables.  You don't have to help him out, Bonnie.  Let him suffer.  I've never heard of flying off the tables.  Someone did the math here.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Even if it was a table, they would still say flying off the shelves.  Do you get that?  Flying off the table.  They were flying off the racks.  And then she's trying to defend them, saying there was an actual table there. 
[03:30:00]  Even if there was a table, you would still say flying off the table.  Well, there was no table.  Selling like hotcakes.  You know what I mean?  It's just what you say.  You're really good at this.  You hope nothing gets past you.  I'm a listener.  I try to listen.  I got to chime in here.  They're misrepresenting the price of satellite radio also.  Someone brought up, XM costs me .01666667 cents an hour to listen to. 
[03:30:30]  Not 25 cents for three minutes, which if you paid, your bill would be $5,400 a month for XM.  Please insert 25 cents for the next three minutes like they're chiming in.  It's .01.  Or one cent.  One cent an hour.  Right.  Is what you're paying. 
[03:31:00]  Please deposit one cent for the next hour.  It doesn't sound as oomph.  We really, we got to stick together.  You're spending too much money.  Just a bunch of dopes in commercial radio.  Here's the final one.  A weather advisory has been issued for the listening area.  Heavy downpours may result in flash floods.  I bet it gets cut off.  Just up to 60 miles per hour threaten to knock down trees and electrical wires.  Once again, a weather advisory.  Where, where?  Authorities urge motorists to exercise extreme caution in the following areas.  Oh, no.  Deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes. 
[03:31:30]  Radio.  I have a penny for an hour.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000.  I don't know.  I'm not going to take a warning from a guy that talks like this.  I, uh.  We're out to you by America's 13,000.  There's flash water on warnings of, uh, the following cow days.  Tsunami alert.  This one brought to you by America's 13,000 radio broadcasters.  Radio.  We're scared shit of satellite radio.  That's pretty much what they're fucking saying there. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  12,998.  Two just got fired for saying something.  And a bunch of these people will, uh, you know, will say, well, what's this about?  I'll find out for myself.  And they're going to be turned on to satellite radio because of those commercials.  Yes.  Just how it works.  Yeah, it is kind of, it does seem like, oh.  Yeah, what is it, radio I pay for?  What?  I got to look into it to see just how awful this is.  Something for the elite?  Why?  Yeah.  I might just like that. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, National Association of Broadcasters.  Of broadcasters.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to finish the Opie and Anthony program with Rich and Bonnie.  We'll get their plugs in.  And maybe we'll do one more tissue time with Michelle.  Our, our brand new bit that worked, uh, very, very well today.  You'll be hearing a lot from that bit in the coming weeks.  Okay.  Really?  Do you remember when the first chick?  Oh.  No, I wanted to make sure he didn't jump on you.  Oh.  But you were doing a Norton thing where you interrupt.  Yeah, I didn't know when she's going into break. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Norton does that.  Go ahead.  The, the first chick, remember when she was, the, the guy was like, do you have a hairy  bush?  And she was like, yeah.  Yeah.  And then he was like, oh, good.  Yeah.  Didn't that kind of, kind of ruin it right there, too?  Are you an Arab?  With a big hairy one.  We had to start somewhere with the big.  You got like a yeast infection.  And we got that Michelle girl.  I like her.  Yeah.  I guess your time with Michelle might work.  She's good.  She doesn't have a big hairy bush.  No.  No.  No. 
[03:33:30]  The virus is inside us.  OAVirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly, the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you. 
[03:34:00]  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  All right.  We're running out of show, guys.  Want to thank Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane for coming in today. 
[03:34:30]  Not done with our show yet, Harry.  Get the fuck out.  We're running up next with Harry.  Fucking door flies open.  There's Harry with the shit.  Like, get done with your little show.  Mr. Poe is now guarding the studio door.  Voss and Bonnie will be at the Improv in Miami this weekend.  Miami this week.  Just keep it at that for now.  You're going to confuse everybody.  Then we'll do your other plug. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, next time we come in.  Or you're recording and we'll play it into spots.  We should each get our own plug.  All right, go ahead.  Miami Improv.  All Carolines.  See, now you're going to confuse everybody.  Miami Improv this week.  Yeah, let's start with that.  Sticker stop there, too.  Sticker stop?  Yeah, they're doing a sticker stop.  You're on NBC TV.  What are you doing with sticker stops?  Why not to get the name out?  XM out.  Hey, is that him standing by the door?  Oh, my God.  Who is this?  Look at this guy. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, man.  What is your name, sir?  My name is Sean.  You're Sean?  Yeah.  Nice to meet you guys.  And what are you doing here today?  I'm applying for an internship.  He's applying for an internship.  Opie, look how he is dressed.  He has got a suit and a fucking internship in Bank of America.  It's double-breasted.  Who gave you that suit?  Frank Nitti or Al Capone?  That is some suit.  Oh, wow.  He's got balls to it.  He's got rich. 
[03:36:00]  Hey, the kid's got a lot of balls.  Intern telling you you're not funny, Rich.  Hey, he killed the car crash.  I wish I had a gun.  It's a funny line.  That's great.  Now, why?  I don't understand the intern coming in with the suit.  He's not an intern yet.  He's going to be...  Or the perspective.  Yeah, he's going to be interviewing, right.  Coming in with the suit.  What did you...  What was the thought process there?  You come in for an interview, you wear a suit.  That's...  Yeah, an interview for like IBM, something like that. 
[03:36:30]  This is an internship.  You're not going to be running the company.  You're not going to be like, you know, call for Hugh Pinero.  No, but you're here.  And I forgot your name already.  Sean Kelly, by the way.  Sean.  Hey, Sean Kelly.  I like to call him the Elo wannabe.  Elo wannabe, yeah.  You have an Elo look to you.  Elo-er.  Elo-er.  So we can call you because you're kind of down there, but not very far.  Now, with the suit.  If I get the internship, I want to be wearing a suit every day.  Oh, yes, you would.  Now you have to.  See, that's the part I have a problem with. 
[03:37:00]  Really?  I think if you're...  Wait, you would wear a suit every day?  No, you said he wouldn't.  Oh, I wouldn't.  All right.  That's the part I have a problem with.  If you're wearing the suit, then if you get the job, shouldn't you then present yourself  like you presented yourself in the interview, or else it's kind of false advertising.  Well, it's kind of like going out with a girlfriend.  The first few months, you act real nice.  You buy them gifts.  You take them out everywhere.  And then after a while, eh.  Who told you that?  That's it.  I kind of like the way he thinks.  I like how he thinks.  His voice is a little wacky, but...  Yeah.  What are you hoping to do with the internship?  Parlay it into a career on the air or behind the scenes? 
[03:37:30]  I'm more into radio production.  Obviously, I don't have the radio voice to be on the air.  So you want to take Steve's job is what you're going for.  Basically, yeah.  If you have a suit with flames on it, that would help.  He looks like a young Mike Francisco.  Let's ask him...  Mike Francesa?  Yeah, whatever the fucking name is.  Mike Francisco.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Francisco.  He's Mike and the Mad Dog Show.  I'm Mike Francisco.  All right, listen.  I'm running out of show here.  Yeah.  Would you wear a Boy Scout uniform? 
[03:38:00]  No, not like Howie.  The Boy Scout salute?  Actually, is Howie now one of your top eight, Anthony, in his Boy Scout uniform?  I have to check.  When I get home, I will be right there and pop him on.  All right, yeah.  Another man in uniform.  If you want to see Howie in a Boy Scout uniform, and it's not Photoshopped, that's how desperate  he is.  He's going to wear costumes now to get the word out.  Well, Mr. Kelly.  Yes.  Thanks for coming in.  Now, we could go either way for you, Ron and Fez, or our show.  I'll be glad either way.  You would be glad either way.  Yes.  Let's go to bodog.net. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, we love the bodog.net.  Do you play poker there, Sean?  You like poker?  All the time, yeah.  I go online.  Every guy.  Do you really?  Unless they're homosexual, play poker.

[03:39:30]  Very good.  All right, Sean.  Good luck to you.  Thank you very much, guys.  Hey, good luck to you.  Top of the morning.  What, do you got a flask in the inner pocket?  Yeah.  A drunk Irishman?  No.  My family just own a bar, so.  How did you prepare for this special day?  I got a suit.  Got a suit.  Didn't go out last night.  Exactly.  No drinking?  No drinking?  Yeah, of course.  Were you all nervous going to sleep last night?  Yeah, just thinking all night of what I was going to say.  You got any? 
[03:40:00]  What he was going to ask me.  You get any advice from anybody?  Not really.  You know what rule number one is?  Don't walk in with a big thing of the next show's shit when the show before is still on  the air.  Yeah.  And just throw the fucking door open like you don't even know or are concerned that there's  another show going on and you just want to get your own show on the air.  There you go.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Take that on the consideration.  We got 20 seconds left.  Did that suit come with a Tommy gun?  Rich.  What?  Oh, that is a good line.  Sorry I interrupted. 
[03:40:30]  But I want to make sure you get your plug in that one.  Because you're leaving.  Yeah, hurry, hurry, plug.  That's all right.  We got 10 seconds.  It's Miami Improv, Bonnie English.  And you're coming in Wednesday because Patrice O'Neill is filling in for the rest of the  week.  What's that?  You're coming in Wednesday.  Yeah.  So we can go over that TV appearance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cool.  Thank you, Bonnie.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See you tomorrow.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
