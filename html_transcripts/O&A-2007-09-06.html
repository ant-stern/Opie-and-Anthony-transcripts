<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and wildly inappropriate affair, characterized by a meandering, often offensive, conversation punctuated by bizarre events and guest appearances. The show opened with a surprise birthday celebration for Sam, featuring a SpongeBob SquarePants piñata (re-purposed for Sam), streamers, and balloons, with the hosts and Jim Norton teasing Sam relentlessly about the decorations.  This led to a protracted, unsuccessful attempt to break the piñata with a child's bat, resulting in a candy-covered studio.  A prank Steve suffered at the hands of Ant, involving a swing-line stapler and Steve's backside during a conference call, was recounted. The death of Luciano Pavarotti was also noted, sparking jokes about heaven's need for a new opera singer.  Roland recounted a nervous encounter with Bill Clinton at a Starbucks, adding another layer to the day’s random anecdotes.  Interspersed throughout were "Fun Fact Thursday" segments covering space, atomic bombs, the sun, and even sperm speed, along with discussions of the NYC cab drivers' strike and Opie's new haircut, culminating in an invitation to Stephen S.'s bachelor party.

The show continued its erratic course with more meandering conversations including  darkly humorous discussions about human survival after the sun's extinction (involving the use of the poor for heat).  A listener’s fun fact about sperm speed was followed by a heated exchange about a "Booby Chew" commercial parody (its inclusion sparking arguments between the hosts and a producer).  This devolved into arguments about responsibility and the quality of the parody itself, briefly followed by discussion of an absurd 1980s AIDS diet plan commercial.  Roland again made an appearance, recounting his Bill Clinton encounter and adding commentary on Clinton's alleged activities in New York.  Pavarotti's death prompted another tribute, featuring Roland’s hilariously off-key rendition of Ave Maria. The segment touched on infidelity in relationships before shifting to the fallout from Imus's firing.

Rob Bartlett, a guest for a substantial portion of the broadcast, joined the studio. His appearance included discussion of the Imus controversy, his own perspective on the situation,  and promoting his upcoming comedy shows.  The hosts, along with Bartlett, engaged in extensive discussions about the lack of loyalty in radio, Imus’s swift punishment, and the perceived hypocrisy among black performers who condemned Imus while seemingly overlooking broader free speech concerns.  The hosts frequently employed highly offensive language including racial slurs and other expletives, while also discussing Ann Coulter, John Edwards, and the Larry Craig scandal.  They also shared their anxieties and fears surrounding the Imus controversy. Bartlett recounted a bizarre story of an encounter between George Hamilton and Lyndon B. Johnson, and the segment also featured a musical impersonation of Pavarotti and further offensive jokes and banter.

Bartlett's presence continued into a segment with even more meandering, extremely crude discussions about sex, childhood experiences (including alleged infidelity, inappropriate touching, and encounters at Chuck E. Cheese), and family dynamics, specifically the hosts' complex relationships with their fathers.  One host described a complex role-playing scenario, and another recounted near-rape and a blindfolded college incident. The conversation delved into personal issues, childhood trauma, therapy, and anxieties, punctuated by vulgar and sexually explicit jokes. The hosts discussed listener-submitted stories involving bizarre and disturbing news items like a prosthetic leg assault, a family keeping their deceased mother’s body in storage, and a teenager's violent crimes.  The segment included several musical interludes and a song with vulgar lyrics.  Bartlett’s career and Law & Order appearances were discussed, leading to a lengthy, highly inappropriate, sexually explicit anecdote about the Happy Days cast. A listener call-in followed, with further discussion about Michael J. Fox's battle with Parkinson's disease, all while maintaining the crude, offensive tone.  The day ended with a birthday celebration featuring unattractive cakes and a discussion of a listener's failed joke.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment focusing on a disastrous cake brought in by Andrea, described in extremely offensive terms (the "color of a deep, dark shit," a "fetal alcohol cake"). Andrea's coughing fits only added to the chaos. This segment included a parody song ("Don't Swear Over FM Radio"), a failed birthday surprise for Sam, who was eventually coaxed into eating some of the awful cake.  Sam also received a genuine WWE championship belt, sparking further excitement and jokes.  Rob Bartlett again promoted his stand-up shows, and Andrea delivered musical performances including "Tomorrow" from *Annie* and an attempted opera piece.  Throughout this final segment, the hosts and guests continued their pattern of extremely vulgar and offensive jokes and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that!  Opie and Anthony.  Catch up a baseball!  Oh, nice!  Oh, that was nice.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work? 
[00:01:00]  This is the worst, the worst show I've...  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ahhhh.  Hey. 
[00:01:30]  The celebrations continue, I guess.  Walked in, there's streamers and balloons and...  And...  And...  Is that a piñata over there?  Yeah.  That's a piñata?  Well, I think...  See, I came in and saw all these balloons and I thought it was, uh...  You know, just a, um...  A celebration of, uh...  You know, uh...  Your upcoming nuptials.  Nuptials. 
[00:02:00]  Nuptials.  Oh, and the rocks.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh...  No, apparently it's for, uh, Sam's birthday.  Happy birthday.  Not yet.  Oh, no, they've been doing it all morning, Jimmy.  Every time someone walks in.  Every time Sam walks in, they just keep singing happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  We've heard it about five or six times so far.  And everyone has a birthday hat today.  Yes.  Jimmy, put your birthday hat on.  I wanna see the hat on, Jimmy. 
[00:02:30]  I normally wouldn't because I feel silly.  Huh?  Let me see.  Sam, I'll do it.  Alright.  Sam, just for you, there's Jim Norton putting on his birthday hat for your birthday.  Aww.  Yay.  That's a...  Yay, he says.  Yay.  I'm so glad these guys spent about an hour and a half, you know,  freaking, uh, decorating the studio today for Sam's birthday.  Well...  They do have it in them to work.  No, I think it's...  It's E-Rock doing his big show prep after the show that he was talking about yesterday. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, E-Rock, uh, E-Rock, you decorated the studio for Sam's birthday today?  I had nothing to do with this, huh?  I had nothing to do with this.  Well, Than is already...  I'm not fessing up.  Than already punched out.  He said he had nothing to do with this.  Wow.  So who decorated the studio for you, Sam?  Little Pixies.  I get it.  It must have been the Pixies.  Came in.  I have no idea this was a surprise to me.  Yeah.  Oh, it's just a nice surprise to walk into.  It's festive.  It's festive.  Balloons.  Festive.  It's pretty festive.  Well, your morning business is so many streamers. 
[00:03:30]  The streamers that kind of...  They were wrapped around my leg.  I'm just trying to close the door.  Yeah, they cover the bathroom door.  They're hanging down.  Like, you ever walk into a meat locker and they got those clear plastic sheets so the  cold doesn't get out?  Yeah.  That's what it's like with streamers.  Only they get sucked into the door.  Yeah.  Don't tear off a piece.  Or not even tear it off.  Just use it to, you know, clean up with.  Might as well.  And just let it hang there.  So who decorated the studio for Sam's birthday? 
[00:04:00]  Sam?  It certainly wasn't me.  This was on the off guard.  Was it Travis?  I don't know.  He just walked out.  I thought it was self-serving.  Well, Travis is trying to get the attention off him.  Everyone's trying to get the attention off themselves lately here.  Maybe interns.  Maybe there was a delegation.  Did someone delegate responsibility to the interns?  Steve had Craig and Renee do this.  Aww.  Yeah, you can tell there's a female touch to this whole thing.  Is there?  Yeah, because if it was a couple guys decorating this place, it wouldn't look as neat and nice. 
[00:04:30]  It just wouldn't.  It's very nice.  Well, when are you going to open up your pinata with all the goodness that's inside there?  It's a Sponge Sam Squarepants pinata.  They crossed out Bob and Sam.  Right.  And it represents his head, which we all know is full of candy.  Oh, man.  And now he's going to have to hit the pinata and candy will spill out.  You know, I realize Steve wants to just be behind the scenes these days.  But could Steve come in and try to get candy out of Sam's head? 
[00:05:00]  I know.  I love when he does that bit.  I love that bit.  He could just try to get it out of the pinata.  True.  What is that?  A wrench?  It would be a metal rod.  They couldn't even bring in like a baseball bat for you?  Oh, it's a mic stand piece.  This is the top of a mic stand.  First of all, that plastic piece is going to fly off and kill somebody.  No.  Travis has just given you the three-year-old bat.  The big bat.  The big bat that a three-year-old would swing.  Hey, Steve, come in here and try to get candy out of Sam's head.  Sam has like rosy cheeks. 
[00:05:30]  And we're convinced that he has candy in his head.  And Steve.  Wait.  Oh, geez.  Wow.  Oh, he was going to wail him with that bat.  Steve is wanting to punch somebody.  Wait, wait.  Steve, get on mic.  Steve is convinced that Sam's head is filled with candy.  It is.  He's just been trying to figure out for the last, what, six months now?  It is.  Up to a year, maybe?  How to get the candy out of his head.  Exactly.  And Sam is stingy.  Sam is stingy.  He holds on.  Sam.  It's also sterly.  Oh, a Louisville. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, what is that?  No, no.  Give him the bat a three-year-old would use.  Not the nice wooden bat.  I want to see him have to hit it a thousand times with that light bat.  All right.  Try to get the candy out of Sam's head there, Steve.  And explain what you're doing.  Well, really what I need is a medical bone saw to go around the edge,  right above the brow line of Sam's head and carve, you know,  basically just go around the brim.  I know, I just like touching Sam.  Yeah, Sam feels all awkward.  He doesn't like people touching him.  He doesn't know what to do. 
[00:06:30]  Especially men that were wondering if...  A burly man that could take you in a second and there would be nothing you could do about  it.  Exactly.  So don't resist.  We go around the brow line with a bone saw and put a hinge on the back so it doesn't  fall off and you tilt up his head.  And what I think is there's a bottomless chasm of candy.  Oh, wow.  In his head.  Is there a candy factory, you think?  It could be a candy factory.  Or was the candy just poured into his skull?  What I really think is that he restocks every night. 
[00:07:00]  Because I think he's constantly eating the candy that's in his head.  And why are you getting violent as far as getting the candy out?  You used to do cute little things where you would pull his earlobes down.  No, that was Than.  Than would do the cute things.  He wants a bone saw.  I would like to chisel Sam's head open.  What were some of the things you guys did to try to get the candy out of Sam's head?  We would hit the back of his head and try to get something out.  I love how you put your hand under his mouth like you're really convinced it might work  and then you hit the back of his head.  We tried to like a combination of iPod moves where you'd rub your thumbs over his eyebrows. 
[00:07:30]  They're getting high tech with trying to get the candy out of Sam's head.  And nary a piece has fallen out.  Exactly.  Eventually it's really just going to be a punch to the face.  Why?  Because, you know, eventually I'll jostle a skittle loose.  Now there's a big picture.  U-Rock's putting a picture of Sam on the pinata.  That's good.  And you could hit it.  Steve, does your ass hurt today? 
[00:08:00]  I'm sorry if it does.  My buttocks are fine.  Why?  What happened?  Oh, during the conference call with WISP yesterday.  I just want to make sure Steve's okay.  I forgot about that.  It was another instance of I just never thought it would work.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's exactly what you didn't think.  Did you move in here?  And it did.  No.  First of all, we were having this conference call, trying to have a conference call with  Philly.  Getting ready for the big visit next week.  Yeah.  And the phone was just screwing up. 
[00:08:30]  And we were all blaming Steve because he couldn't figure out what buttons to push or something.  It wasn't at all, but thank you very much.  It wasn't your fault.  It wasn't your fault.  But then I saw him, like, because he was hunched over the phone.  And I saw him look at the chair and get ready to pull it over.  And I had just been playing with the swing line stapler.  So he pulled the chair over.  And the second he sat down, I slid it under his butt.  And it made the typical sound of a stapler as a staple was thrust into his butt cheek. 
[00:09:00]  It worked perfectly.  I was quite livid at that moment.  Yes.  He was very angry.  It was hysterical.  You know what the best part of being angry is?  So Steve's really angry because Ant did that, right?  But then you have six or seven guys in a room all laughing at you.  Oh, yeah, laughing.  So the laughter just outdid the anger.  Yeah, it diffuses it.  And it's also the, you know, the while I'm furious, it's don't hit him, he'll die.  Don't punch me, he'll take it.  Yeah.  It would just be really awkward if you hit someone as everyone else is laughing. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, it would be awkward.  It would really wreck the mood in the room, man.  Yeah, really.  It's a buzz kill.  He spent the rest of the time trying to dial the phone with one hand and pull a staple out of  his ass cheek with the other.  It was in there and I just couldn't, I think I was trying to figure out if it went through  the jeans or if it was still lodged in there and it was on the floor somewhere.  It was just one of those, you know, you ever have your girlfriend try to, she sits in a  chair and you take your hand and just stick it underneath her butt and she sits on your  hand and goes, hey, hey. 
[00:10:00]  That's how it was with the stapler.  It's perfect.  Aww.  All right.  That was lovely.  So Sam's going to open up his piñata so we can maybe do a radio show today.  Yay.  You got a big birthday dinner plan, by the way?  Oh.  Yeah, my mom will make me chicken fingers.  Is that the big...  Chicken fingers.  Yeah.  When I was growing up, my mom would make a special dish every birthday.  Oh, yeah.  Birthday.  Your favorite.  Yeah, what's your favorite?  They're her homemade chicken fingers.  They have a little... 
[00:10:30]  Homemade chicken fingers?  Well, yeah.  You cut up a chicken breast and she has like some kind of like coating that's got like  sesame seeds and bread crumb.  Crisp crumb coating.  That's it.  Crisp crumb coating.  And it's really good.  Really something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the balloons, by the way, it says fish bakey for everybody.  Okay.  Fish bakey.  Fish bakey.  That's for the people that linger longer with the O.P. and Anthony show.  There is a balloon in here that says fish bakey.  Fish bakey.  What were you saying, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I'm trying to watch what else he had. 
[00:11:00]  He's got to have some applesauce or...  I don't think I'll have applesauce.  He doesn't like applesauce, right?  Yeah, no.  Not really.  Baby food applesauce.  You like that?  I might have some corn on the cob.  I like corn on the cob a lot.  Oh, yeah.  Of course you do.  And then does mommy like clean your fingers off with a napkin?  I wash my own hands.  Oh, you wash your own hands.  Yeah.  You're a big boy now.  All right, Sam.  Well, it's...  How old are you now?  24.  Oh, wow.  24 years old for Sam.  He's such a big boy.  He sure is.  You want to go at it with the pinata? 
[00:11:30]  Sure.  Let's see if we can do that.  All right.  Can we get a mic on Sam?  Why is the naked Harry Potter pig there now on the pinata?  Obviously Travis.  That had to be Travis.  Yeah.  Travis has like piles of those.  Yeah.  We got one side is Sam's huge head filled with candy.  At least we're convinced of that.  And on the other side, yeah, we got the Harry Potter nude.  Harry Potter.  From what?  Equus?  I don't know.  Whatever the hell he's in.  The English version of Equus.  All right.  There you go, Sam. 
[00:12:00]  Here it is with your bat that a three-year-old would swing.  Yeah.  Swing at that pinata for your birthday.  Oh, no.  Wow.  This is just like having naked women in the studio.  Whoa, the excitement.  This is such a party.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Yay.  Wow.  Yay.  Hooray.  Hooray.  Come on.  You hit.  Come on, Sam.  You hit like a kid.  Look, he's just.  Why don't you line up and crack that thing? 
[00:12:30]  Sam.  Wait, Sam.  Is that being hung up with audio tape?  Get back here.  What is it?  I don't know.  A little observation.  You weren't really good at sports growing up, were you?  No.  Not necessarily.  Oh.  You swing a little awkward.  Well, it's a, you know.  It's a plastic band.  What was your sport growing up?  I did a little of the old T-ball.  Oh, my God.  Most people would say baseball.  He had a.  I tapped out.  You pretty much stopped at T-ball.  Yeah.  I tapped out then.  People are commenting, holy S, that was pathetic. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Just make believe it's E-rock.  Yeah.  T-ball, LOL.  How about T-bag?  Yeah.  Hits like he eats, just like a kid.  You swing like your tampon might get in the way.  You really swing bad.  It's a little kid's bad.  No, no, no.  Go ahead.  Any man should be.  Any man of 24 years old should be able to crack that open with that.  Yeah.  Oh, here's another picture. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, it's a picture of you and Rob Zombie.  Oh, no.  Now you have to hit your hero, Rob Zombie.  Now wind up.  To get to the goodness inside the pinata.  You're A-Rod.  Yeah.  A-Rod hit two more dingers last night.  Let's go.  Oh, there you are.  Now we're talking.  All right.  Now we're getting close to the goodness.  Oh, wow.  It's spinning.  It's spinning crazily.  Wow.  This is just as fun as nude women.  Oh, boy.  You should have been first on the team. 
[00:14:00]  You suck at this.  Yeah.  Why don't you-  Wow.  You're hitting it like-  It's not a flying or squatting.  You're hitting it like-  Why aren't you like really like winding up like you would hit a baseball?  I don't hit baseballs.  Have you ever hit a baseball?  Yeah, off a tee.  You never hit one that was pitched to you?  No, I'm sure I've hit them.  I've not hit them more often than hit them.  All right.  Give him the big boy bat. 
[00:14:30]  Thank you.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Fly out of your hand and fly through that window.  This is the first break on the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, look at this.  It has to be done by 620.  Let's go.  There must be someone from Philly.  This is almost as good as 10,000 marbles being released.  Oh.  All right.  Hold on.  We also-  Tim made a birthday montage.  Oh, wow.  This is Garth Brooks.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Not all of you are singing.  Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to you. 
[00:15:00]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  I think I'm another world.  Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday. 
[00:15:30]  We get it.  What archive did Tim take this from?  It's birthday time, it's such a thrill.  Don't be sad, you're over the hill.  You've got many more years to come.  We love you, you're number one.  Oh my God, Tim.  They're killing us.  Wow. 
[00:16:00]  We're going to steal this from the good guys archive.  That was great.  The good guys, time for your birthday wishes today.  Lorraine's celebrating her 42nd birthday out there in Brooklyn.  Yuck.  These are the worst.  Oh, those are fun.  They don't, but they don't go rah.  All right, take the big boy bat and let's open up the guillotine.  Look how he's choked up on that bat.  I'm going to go old school, looking like Felix Rion.  I'm going to get my head taken off.  No one trusts him.  Oh my God.  I know, this bat's going to fly out of his hands and kill somebody. 
[00:16:30]  Here we go.  Hey, look at that.  He knocked it off the line and it broke open.  Oh, we're seeing all sorts of candy on the floor.  It's crazy in here now.  This is so unbelievably exciting.  I'm so glad we did it.  Oh my God, this is unbelievable.  At the beginning of the 6 o'clock hour.  No, we're not stupid.  We know not many people are listening at this point.  You think we're going to save this for 730?  Are you crazy? 
[00:17:00]  Stop it.  One of you.  Oh, wow.  Did that come out of his head?  Steve is screaming that for the first time in a year and we got candy out of Sam's head.  No, it came out of the piñata.  It didn't come out of the piñata.  What type of candy?  It was in there the whole time.  It looks like a little green gumball.  A little sucker candy.  A little piece of bubble gum.  I love the super bubble bubble gum.  Which one do you want?  I think it's going to remind me of my youth.  I want super bubble.  Let me see.  Super bubble?  Ow.  I think I dropped another one. 
[00:17:30]  It was very hard.  Several pieces of bubble gum came out.  There's candy all over the studio.  Sam.  It has flavor for three seconds.  A happy boy delivered candy.  And it's an awful flavor for three seconds.  Hey, Sam, is this the type of candy you like?  Yeah.  Oh boy, that means no.  You don't like this type of candy?  Yeah, of course I do.  Red lollipops?  Who doesn't like red lollipops?  Sweet tarts?  Sweet tarts now and laters?  Come on.  Tootsie rolls?  Tootsie rolls are great. 
[00:18:00]  You like Tootsie Rolls?  Yeah.  It's kind of chocolatey.  Yeah.  Tootsie Rolls suck.  What do you mean?  If you're going to have Tootsie Rolls, you should have chocolate.  What?  Right?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, these.  But it's a chocolate chew.  I understand that, but it's not as good as just having chocolate.  Come on, now and later.  I'm going to have one now.  Now and later.  And later.  Suck.  All right, what else?  Yeah, they put the cheapest candy in those pinatas.  Clearly it's awful.  Now and later.  Who can enjoy that?  How about one Hershey product? 
[00:18:30]  How about a bunch of Snickers and some laughs?  There you go.  Mm.  Unmarked jawbreakers with no specific brand.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  A whole pinata full of candy.  There you go.  Happy birthday.  Everybody just rushing for it.  Now, can we get these balloons out of the studio so we can do a radio show?  Like men.  Oh, that's awful gum.  Oh, I like them.  Horrible.  Oh, the party favors are out.  Where'd they get the Michael Vick party hats? 
[00:19:00]  We won't even elaborate.  Why isn't there no noise in my noise maker?  I know.  I hate those.  You don't like now and laters, Jimmy?  I can't tell you how much I hate them.  I'm going to have one.  I'm going to pass out trying to make noise out of that dumb thing.  All right, Sam.  Happy birthday, Sam.  There you go, everybody.  Yeah.  Ow.  What happened?  Oh, it's eat one now. 
[00:19:30]  See the dentist later.  What do you eat?  What do you eat?  Now and later.  These are filling pullers of extraordinary magnitude.  If the rumors are true, there is a piece of candy that Mr. Stern can't eat anymore.  Let me tell you, Robin.  Where's my glass of dentures?  Yeah, you're going to have to adjust your impression if that's true, man.  Maybe I'll do it an hour later in my mouth.  Robin, what's on the next subject? 
[00:20:00]  My choppers are coming out.  Oh, come on.  I write me a joke.  I need an hour later now in my mouth to do the impression.  Yeah.  It is doing this.  You're slurring the S just like we had.  That's wonderful.  Talk a little more about Howard Television.  Howard Television is fantastic.  Well, I was out at the Hamptons this weekend, Robin. 
[00:20:30]  Of course, there's a pretty interesting rumor that someone found Howard's dentures out there  in the Hamptons in his bathroom.  It's a rumor.  Mm-hmm.  Suffering suckers head.  We have no idea, but man.  God, that would be fun for the radio show if it's true.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's how we start today's show.  Great.  Now clean this up. 
[00:21:00]  Can we get rid of the balloons now?  They're not my balloons.  Why don't you pop one here?  Here's a toothpick.  We should have a fun way to pop them.  Yeah.  Like darts.  Well, he could use his hair.  Like Kenny's.  Just prick.  Pluck.  I said a bad word.  Just pluck one of Kenny's hairs out and use that.  You know what's great about Kenny's hair, his dry hair?  He sat down on the chair and all the balloons are slowly moving toward Kenny's head.  Yeah.  Static electricity. 
[00:21:30]  Look, the one on the pole wants to be funny.  It really is.  Look at that painted on smile.  He's not like comfortable with a room full of men smiling at him.  He's not comfortable with any type of celebration is what it comes down to.  That's right.  That's right.  We're going to celebrate something of yours there, sir.  Something, Kenny.  Are you a big fan of the birthday or what?  I'm very happy for Sam.  He made it another year.  The anniversary of your first perp beating.  Can we celebrate that? 
[00:22:00]  We'll hang phone books all over the studio.  You're giving people the wrong impression of me.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I am.  I was a professional.  So I hear.  Many people are limping the streets remembering that.  By the way, you know they're not filming The Sopranos anymore, right?  Yeah.  You're hoping to be an extra in that, aren't you?  It's too late.  It really is too late.  I dress nicely.  Doesn't he look like he should be in the background and bada-bang or something? 
[00:22:30]  Like one of Tony's guys that doesn't really get to talk on the show, but dresses the part?  I got an image.  All right.  Be credit as thug number four.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's phone call Thursday, everybody.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let's not forget.  Phone call Thursday.  I did.  Is happening.  And it's also fun fact Thursday.  That I like.  What fun facts are we going to learn today?  You know, I actually enjoy fun fact Thursday. 
[00:23:00]  Do you?  Yeah, because I kind of like little fun tidbits of information.  Okay.  We don't get them because stupid phone call Thursday ties up the phone lines.  Right.  But if we get one fun fact, I'm feeling good.  All right.  And after the break, we're going to let the rest of America laugh in New York City.  Yeah.  We got to talk about that cab strike and why the cabbies are striking here in New York City.  Is it doing anything?  And the rest of the cab?  Well, we'll get a cab.  It costs me more money.  Yeah.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we'll get into it next. 
[00:23:30]  That's the big story here in New York City.  Cabbies on strike and wait till you find out why.  Oh, a tease.  A news tease.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I...  Pavarotti died.  That's the big news today.  He's got amazing to have the newspaper.  Like, I mean, the paper can only do what they can do, but it's like Pavarotti gravely ill. 
[00:24:00]  Luciano worse.  Yeah.  But then it's like the internet's just smashing the paper.  Why would you go to the newspaper for your news, man?  I got caught because I'm at my desk there and I go, oh, wow, Pavarotti's really sick.  He's not going to make the week.  And then it goes, uh, you're a little late on that one.  He didn't.  And Newsday had it on the front cover.  Oh, they made it?  Yeah, they got the Pavarotti died thing right on their front page.  But what?  The Daily News or The Post blew it?  I think Daily News and The Post both blew it.  Yeah, I'm guessing that they closed up shop or however they do it before. 
[00:24:30]  Because I read on Drudge last night that he had fallen ill.  Yeah.  They go to sleep early over there, I guess.  Whenever someone famous dies, you have to say, well, I guess God needed an opera singer.  Oh, God.  I guess God needed some entertainment.  Yes.  God needed.  The angels needed someone to lead them.  Oh, God.  In a song.  It makes people feel better.  Does it?  God needed entertainment.  Jenna Jameson would have done. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, there you go.  I guess God needed a DP expert.  Ah, are we listening to the wonderful voice?  And late Pavarotti.  Yes.  Now he's Pavarotti-ing.  Is that the first one?  Come on.  Is that the first one out of the chute, people?  Yo, dude, you can't do that, dude.  You didn't say that. 
[00:25:30]  It's Pavarotti.  Thank you.  Feel free.  Yes.  People are asking if they could use that, and of course.  Yes.  Well, there you go.  So, if you want to come up with your own, well, I guess God.  I guess God needed an opera singer.  Oh, my God.  Who died recently?  And they actually...  Phil Rizzuto.  Oh, yeah.  God needed a second or shortstop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, Phil Rizz...  God needed an 85-year-old shortstop.  Like, God's got some awful team.  Yeah.  If God really needed a, you know, a good, like, fielder, wouldn't he take A-Rod in his 
[00:26:00]  prime?  Holy cow!  Oh, shut up already.  God's sitting there going, oh, I took the wrong one.  My timing's all up.  Yeah, because to God, like, I don't know, 50 years is nothing.  Right.  60 years?  That's not...  So, he doesn't know.  He's like, Phil Rizzuto.  Okay.  I'll grab him up.  Oh, jeez.  I keep forgetting.  That's like a second for him.  Yeah.  God would take the young, right?  Yeah.  He's going to take the young.  He can't scale it down.  Make sure his team is, you know, stacked. 
[00:26:30]  God's team's got to win every game.  Every game.  God's team cannot drop a game.  He's, like, infallible.  Right.  You can't let the, you know, the other guy there win.  It's got to be a blowout, too.  Absolutely.  No errors?  Nothing?  Mm-mm.  It's God's team.  You don't want the, you know...  Well.  The evil guy there to win every World Series.  No.  So, you've got to make sure you've got the best team up there in heaven.  Yeah.  He's got Phil Rizzuto and Pavarotti's out there to sing the national anthem. 
[00:27:00]  That's Phil Rizzuto attempts to feel the ball.  That's right.  And he realizes it's his prostate he just picked up and threw.  That Pavarotti could belt out a tune, though.  Yeah.  He certainly could.  We're trying to get Roland, in honor of Pavarotti's passing, to do a little Pavarotti today.  Is he going to lose 20 pounds?  He's going to sweat a little more.  Roland coming in today?  Because a big email went out yesterday. 
[00:27:30]  I love when we get these big emails.  Most of the emails we get is boring crap, like, can you guys meet with blah, blah, blah  on Thursday and wreck your entire day?  Because they can't get in early, so you're going to have to wait around the office for  two hours just so you can meet them and make believe you care for 10 minutes.  Can you do that for us?  But yesterday, we actually got an email that was kind of cool to read.  Roland, our own Roland, was online at, what, Starbucks there, Iraq?  Yeah, right across from XM.  That's Starbucks?  Right there?  Wow. 
[00:28:00]  Wow, damn, you just missed that.  What time was it?  Still got the best picture ever.  I'm not sure.  Exactly, but it was sometime during the XM portion of the show.  Okay.  Wow.  So, a Starbucks very close to where we're broadcasting from, and Roland goes in there  for some coffee, and all of a sudden, someone taps him on the shoulder and says, can I cut  you?  Can I get to the front of the line?  Can I get to the front of the line?  What privilege?  What privilege?  And it turns out it was a former president, Bill Clinton. 
[00:28:30]  Hi.  Can I get to the front of the line?  Tap some, did he tap him on the shoulder?  I'm amazed that a president even has to ask that.  Just turn around and go, no.  Get in line like everyone else, and have the Secret Service just put you in a chokehold.  How about this?  No, you can't.  I'm a Republican.  I think I don't like Democrats.  I didn't vote for you.  Right.  I'm not voting for your wife.  Right. 
[00:29:00]  I told my girlfriend that story last night.  Yeah.  And she actually, this is how powerful a guy Clinton is to women.  She was like, really?  Oh, wow.  Just stunned.  You, I wanted to grab her pigtails and just, and choke her.  She was wearing little pigtails yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As per my request.  Looked very cute.  Wait, but yesterday you really didn't have a girlfriend.  Well, that's not, yeah, I still have a girlfriend.  It's just we're back in a way.  Well, that's why I said you really, kind of, it was, you do, but you didn't.  It was kind of shaky. 
[00:29:30]  You were on thin ice, the whole thing.  Well, I just said I wanted to choke her.  Well, that's, well, that's, sorry that I assumed so much, Jimmy, after what you said yesterday.  That reaction from her, because we've talked about celebrities before, but that was a  genuine, like, oh my God.  Yeah.  Somebody got to meet him that you know, reaction.  That's, I'm like, did you get a picture?  And as long as Roland didn't get a picture.  Well, it gets better because Roland gets very nervous around politicians, just politicians.  Everybody.  No. 
[00:30:00]  Well, he's a nervous Nelly to begin with, but when it comes to politics, it's really hot  in here, right?  I thought I was going to.  But when it comes to politicians, he has something else.  That goes on.  What happened to you, Rock?  He calls them Forrest Gump moments.  So every time he's met a very powerful politician, he has to go make a duty.  He gets all nervous.  His inside, what, empty?  He's probably getting a Mexican.  He's here illegally.  They didn't dump out of that, right?  I don't think so.  All right.  Yeah.  When he meets a powerful politician, he has to run to the old restaurant. 
[00:30:30]  Turlet.  The turlet.  Yeah.  He's got to sit down.  He's got to sit down.  And tap his feet.  So is he coming in to tell his story?  Yeah.  And then supposedly what?  Clinton bought coffee for Roland and a few other people that he cut?  Apparently, he put his arm around Roland and was holding Roland, so Roland couldn't run  to the bathroom.  And then Clinton...  Oh, if he would have just right in his pants.  Could you imagine?  Oh, he's a little nervous. 
[00:31:00]  A little nervous there.  I see.  That's happened before.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, my God.  That would have been hysterical.  Stephen asked for Bashar.  Roland is Forrest Plump.  Forrest Dump.  Look at that Forrest Dump.  There you go.  So what happened?  Clinton had his arm around him?  Put his arm around him and told the people at Starbucks that he was going to buy Roland's  order and I guess everybody else that he got in front of the line.  What that means is, hey, guys, Starbucks, just pick up the tab for these nice people.  Yeah.  The story of me being here is more important than $30 you're going to lose. 
[00:31:30]  Charge Clinton.  And then Roland's standing there.  Clinton has his arm around Roland, but then there's security and then there's people taking  photos.  There's thousands of people that he's taking to the bathroom.  What?  What happened?  You made your own coffee.  I wonder, I bet you he would have taken a photo, too, because his wife is running.  So no politician is going to say no. 
[00:32:00]  The wife is running for office.  Apparently he was taking photos with everybody there.  Of course, yeah.  Oh, and he missed it.  Oh, boy, Jimmy.  It's out Friday-wide.  Yeah.  It's out, all right.  Is it?  It's out, all right.  It's a turtling Friday now.  So is he coming in?  We've got to hear from Roland.  Yeah, he should be here soon.  And are we getting some Pavarotti together for him to sing?  Yes.  All right.  I don't know how we're going to make that happen.  A little tribute.  Because isn't Pavarotti just nonsense?  I think some people call it nonsense. 
[00:32:30]  Some people call it Italian.  It's just nonsense.  I don't know.  Nonsense.  Get the big song that Pavarotti used to sing and we'll see what Roland does with it.  What?  I'm all nervous like there's a celebrity around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  That is a good one.  You know, he's walking around New York, man.  He's even more accessible than Reagan would.  He's a New Yorker.  You know, I think it was before we went on vacation, I guess.  I'm trying to remember exactly. 
[00:33:00]  But the way we walk home sometimes, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Oh, really?  Just hanging out on 57th Street.  Well, they go into that art place all the time.  That's the same place I go for my favorite.  Being followed by a Benetton ad.  It's just...  Look, it's a Sonny D commercial.  Oh, no, it's to children.  Well, here's what we got on Pavarotti this morning.  Luciano Pavarotti's vibrant high seas and exuberant showmanship made him one of opera's biggest stars. 
[00:33:30]  The bearded, oversized tenor first achieved fame in the 1960s.  His career would span four decades.  The son of a baker, Pavarotti learned to sing in a church choir and local opera chorus.  He would go on to play the world's most famous venues from Milan's...  She's horrible, by the way.  ...the most metropolitan opera house.  This chick's, like, reading...  Critics raised eyebrows when Pavarotti held charity events where he performed with pop stars from Elton John to Mariah Carey.  Mariah Carey.  She's just reading, like, a bio, an obit. 
[00:34:00]  Pavarotti was so fat at one point.  He would travel with his own toilet.  With his own toilet.  Oh, remember that?  Just in case Bill Clinton dropped in.  That's what Roland needs to do.  Just travel with his own toilet bowl.  That's so funny.  I love that.  You know what Roland is like?  He's like a turtle who sees a lion running at it.  His whole body just goes empty.  He's, like, preparing for battle.  Oh, that is so funny.  How did he not get a picture?  He had a go. 
[00:34:30]  Because he had a go.  Because he had a go.  He had a go.  How funny is it that they roll in the toilet to these, you know, really nice hotels when Pavarotti showed up?  When they would lift him on a lift when he would have to get to a stage with stairs.  There was some kind of a lift because he was 350 or 400 pounds.  They would lift him.  He couldn't walk up the stairs?  No.  Wow.  It's amazing he could sing with that kind of weight on him.  Because if I can't take a deep breath, I'd panic.  Yeah.  I found out, by the way, about that breath thing.  I wasn't letting all my air out, which is why I was having problems taking those deep breaths.  So I would watch him. 
[00:35:00]  I'd be like, how did a guy that fat breathe and sing like that?  It's pretty amazing.  So is your nightmare like one of those mob deaths where someone just comes up behind you and starts wrapping your head in plastic?  I think that would be everybody's nightmare.  That's a pretty bad one.  Well, yeah.  What am I talking about?  Yeah.  I'd be going, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Yeah.  And I don't think anyone would be laughing through that.  No, I did dream about, I won't go through the whole dream, but I did dream that Opie and I were walking home together.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  What happened?  No, it's nothing.  I was showing off for you. 
[00:35:30]  I said I wanted to show off for Opie.  What happened?  So I was floating backwards.  Like, Opie was walking in front of me.  And I'm sitting, picture how you would sit in a lounge chair sitting straight up with your legs sticking straight out.  And I was floating in about your, like, we were kind of, like, still the same height.  Just in midair?  Just floating back and talking to Opie.  Because I wanted to show off for my friend.  That's showing off, man.  And then just to show off, as cars were coming, I was bouncing from car hood to car hood like Qbert.  Like Q-Bert.  But, like, as cars were driving, I'm bouncing on car hoods. 
[00:36:00]  How come at those moments you just don't go, all right, this is obviously ridiculous.  You still wake up and go, oh, thank God, that was a dream.  One guy got mad.  So he parked a car 100 yards ahead of me.  And he was, like, really mad.  And for some reason, I started yelling all this racial stuff at him.  So he started firing at me.  He started shooting at me.  And he hit a glass that was in front of me that I didn't know.  So it cracked like a windshield.  And then he started to chase me into the house I grew up in. 
[00:36:30]  And it wasn't a black guy.  Wow.  I had been yelling black racial epithets.  But it turned out it was an Italian guy, like a mob guy.  Ah.  So he's in my parents' old house with a shotgun.  Trying to kill me.  Wow.  Yeah.  What an odd dream.  Yeah, there was more of it.  But, I mean, it was bouncing from the Q-Bert.  We're going to have to analyze that dream.  There's websites that analyze your dreams.  I had therapy.  She talked about it yesterday.  She made me talk about it.  Oh, yeah.  Made you talk about the Q-Bert bouncing off the cars thing?  Did she come up with some kind of brief thing?  You don't have to get into it, but what it means. 
[00:37:00]  It had something to do with liking, obviously, liking to be noticed, liking attention, liking  to do outrageous things, and then maybe being afraid of the consequences.  Oh.  She's smart.  Hence the guy with the shotgun.  Right.  She's smart.  And then she said, who's this, Opie?  He sounds dishy.  And we both like, ah, to each other.  Dishy.  No, she's good.  And you had to go, excuse me, he's taken.  That's right.  Taken, Missy.  God, am I jealous?  Damn Clinton picture.  Yeah.  All right, here. 
[00:37:30]  We got more on Pavarotti.  I thought you were going to say, of Lindsay.  More critically, one could match Pavarotti's combination of natural talent and charm.  His name ended up on the gossip pages as often as the music reviews, particularly after  splitting with his wife of 35 years and taking up with his 26-year-old secretary.  Oh!  He married in 2003 and had one daughter.  Throughout his career, Pavarotti struggled with a much-publicized weight problem.  Oh, right.  400 pounds.  His health seriously declined in 2006 when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
[00:38:00]  Eesh, that's the biggie.  He underwent surgery, forcing him to cancel the remaining concerts in his farewell tour.  Pavarotti made no public appearances after the operation.  The singer called the illness a penalty for all the happiness and fame in his life.  Eesh.  Pavarotti is survived by his wife and four daughters.  Well, he never probably did anything but eat the best pastry in the world on a house.  All on the arm.  You know that guy didn't pay a dime for any food. 
[00:38:30]  The best chefs in the world made that fatso whatever he wanted.  Just so he can sit there and go, oh, delicioso.  Delicioso.  And the chef would be like, grazie, grazie.  And, uh, fat bastard would walk out with just as much cash as he came in with.  There was a Chinese restaurant.  So the guy saying grazie was just so odd. 
[00:39:00]  It looked really strange.  And then he would have to go to the bathroom.  Yes.  And have his giant industrial toilet forklifted in.  God almighty, could you show us some self-control?  A slob.  When it gets to the point where you're traveling with your own toilet, maybe.  There's a problem.  Because maybe there's a problem.  That should tell you there's a problem.  When they're screwing it down to the floor with the things they use in garages to take the tires off your car.  Yeah.  Vroom!  Vroom!  How embarrassing is that, though, when you know a team had to be brought in. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Your toilet team.  That was their whole job, right?  To bring his toilet.  And what about, like, cleaning it?  Because someone's got to clean it before you move it.  And that's got to be hooked up to a plumbing system.  They probably just, like, I don't know.  Or did it just, like, come in?  Was it self-contained?  They probably just took it through a car wash or something.  I need to know.  On the way out of town.  I need to know about his toilet.  Yeah, well, we'll find out.  It's Fun Fact Thursday.  We'll get a fun fact about Pavarotti's toilet there.  Hey, we can't tease and then not do the thing. 
[00:40:00]  I learned that the last couple of days.  The cab strike here in New York.  Oh, right.  The cabbies are striking in New York City because they're not happy with the GPS system that is now in all the cabs.  They don't want GPS and they don't want the credit card.  You can't stop technology is what I...  See, people, they're also putting the credit card in there.  Right.  So you swipe the credit card to pay, and you don't have to deal with the smelly cab driver at all. 
[00:40:30]  You don't even have to deal with them.  They should put something in the back where you just go beep, beep, beep, and press in your destination so you don't even have to tell them that.  You know what it is, too?  They're going to get less tips because people are just going to swipe for the amount and hit the button.  This amount or add a tip.  Bing.  And everything they make is now going to be declared on the books because it's not going to be cash.  Not cash.  Now, Bloomberg, the mayor here, has said it is going to amount to more tips because people will feel compelled to write something in instead of giving them actual cash. 
[00:41:00]  But that's not true because, you know, whenever you take a cab ride, if it's $12, $12, $10, let's say, you're going to give $15 or more.  You know, but you're at least going to round it up to that next denomination that's an even number like for dollar bills.  With swiping, I would probably just swipe the goddamn thing and then forget about it. 
[00:41:30]  I wouldn't even think about a tip at that point then.  And the union was saying that it's about Muslims.  This is how they were trying to get them to fight it.  They were saying that they're using it to track Muslims.  Oh, the GPS.  Yes, we are.  Well, probably.  Let's hope so.  But, I mean, that's not the intent of it because cab companies want to know where you are at all times because that's how they can track if you're stealing from them.  Right.  Or whatever.  Or they want to know where their cars are good.  Yep.  It's good to have that GPS, too.  It's kind of fun to kind of just see what's going on. 
[00:42:00]  See where they are.  Someone's going to go, oh, man.  Well, you know, also, yeah, there's cabs.  A lot of times you can't find a cab.  They're off duty, things like that.  And now these people are going to be able to keep track of where they are.  What do you got there?  I love it.  Oh, I was just saying that I've actually used the system.  Oh.  I know I'm on the cutting edge.  And there's just a button.  And then, hey, the cabbies will always do the cash thing.  And then they have to, oh, I have to redo it now with the credit card thing. 
[00:42:30]  They make it a huge pain.  Oh, so they instantly go and set everything up for a cash transaction.  And then you go, no, I was going to pay with a credit card.  And he's like, well, now I have to redo it, hopefully, you know, trying to get you to be like, oh, never mind.  I'll use a cash.  Well, screw that now.  From now on, I'm going to go, I want to go here.  And I'm paying with a credit card.  Yeah.  But it's set up so it's the amount.  And then there's buttons, how much you want to tip, $1, $2, like that.  Oh, really?  So people could end up tipping. 
[00:43:00]  People will tip because on a credit card, you don't see it coming into your pocket.  I always tip more on a credit card.  Yeah, I do, too.  You can't stop technology.  It's here.  You got to just embrace it.  But you're right.  The tips will be taxed.  It's all taxed now.  They can't just say, oh, I've only made so many tips.  Opie and Anthony's Fun Fact Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Thursday.  Featuring, but not necessarily specifically limited to, fan. 
[00:43:30]  Here's fan.  Sometimes, but not every time.  And it's not every time this time because we got Sonny Ferrelli on the end of the feedback.  He's got a fun fact.  The average Pavarotti poop will fall 9.8 meters per second in a vacuumless state.  Okay.  That's a fact.  It sure is.  I don't know how fun it is.  Fun Fact.  Oh, Thin, you actually have a fun fact?  Yeah, this is from when people were sending me one.  One is Thin is gay. 
[00:44:00]  That's actually not a fun fact.  It's fun for other people, though.  It's fun, but I'm not sure if it's a fact.  It might not be fun for you, but it's fun for others.  Lindsey from Clifton wrote, if you've farted consistently for six years and nine months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.  How long?  Six years and nine months.  And how many times you got to fart in that time?  It just says consistently.  Consistently.  Well, that would be consistently means you're eating beans every day. 
[00:44:30]  That's consistent.  I'm going to contest that.  An atomic bomb is a little vague also.  How many megatons are we talking here?  It doesn't list the megatonage, Huffy.  Well, this one.  I have a fun fact that I learned.  Yeah.  And this is true.  Every second, the sun produces more energy than has ever been made by man in his entire existence on this planet.  Really?  Thank you.  I have a fun fact about the sun, too. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you.  Yes?  It could go out at any second.  No, it can't.  My God.  Stop that.  Freaking us all out.  We're powerless.  We're powerless to that, aren't we?  Oh, my God.  How the hell do you know it's just going to keep burning?  I look up at that sun and go, if you got close to the sun, and were able to, obviously, and actually saw what the F was going on up there, you would die.  Oh, it's insanity.  You would freak the F out.  Like, this is keeping us alive, this unstable mass that's just floating there? 
[00:45:30]  It really is just a mess of molecules banging off of each other and reacting.  And it's like, what's to keep it from just busting?  And also, it's gas.  Right.  There's nothing solid there.  So it could just, like, disappear.  Disappear.  One day.  It could just blow away.  Yes, that's right.  I look at that sun sometimes. 
[00:46:00]  I look up, and I look right back down.  Like, you just keep doing what you're doing, whatever that is.  Or what about the opposite?  What if it just decides to get bigger?  Yeah.  They say that's what's probably going to happen.  And just, you know, well, it does grow, and then it goes supernova.  Not our sun's not big enough, but it will grow.  Our sun could supernova.  No, it can't.  Once it gets big.  It'll grow probably, they say, probably past the Earth.  It'll eventually envelop the Earth, and I don't know if it'll hit Jupiter or not.  Become a red giant.  Nah, it's not big enough. 
[00:46:30]  And then a white dwarf.  It'll just shrink down and become like a big blob of nothing.  Like, it'll look like Roland's pants after Clinton left.  Like a little marble.  Yeah, it won't be.  Hey, we do have some fun facts coming in before we take this break that we're a little late for.  It's a scary sun.  Isn't this scary?  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  His fun fact today is this.  Opie lost half his fortune over vacation.  And Bill from Waterford, I have a fun fact.  Than's mom is a sociopath.  Oh, well, we don't know anymore. 
[00:47:00]  Have you spoken?  No, okay.  No, of course not.  Just checking.  I have a fun fact about space.  Oh.  Ooh, could we save it for after the break?  We certainly can.  Did Kaku tell you this one?  No, but I think Dr. Kaku would agree.  Oh, I love fun facts about space.  They're the only kind of fun facts anyone should.  Oh.  I haven't seen him in the old grocery store lately.  I haven't either.  Buying his 1% milk.  He's healthy.  He might be lactose intolerant.  He knows everything about black holes and string theory, but... 
[00:47:30]  His gas is atrocious.  Right.  Oh, is that a fun fact?  The big yellow one's the sun.  There you go.  That's a fun fact.  Another fun fact coming in.  The big yellow one is indeed the sun.  Can you play that one more time, please?  Oh, we rock.  Oh, boy.  You rock.  You rock.  You rock.  You rock.  The big yellow one's the sun.  There you go.  You slide.  More fun facts coming in.  There was something else.  Oh, finally.  Because we couldn't do it yesterday. 
[00:48:00]  And we will do it after the break.  I promise.  Maybe not, because I can't find it.  Oh.  Booby Chew next.  We never got to booby chew.  That's right.  God, it's a surprise for me every day, this show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Someone's asking on Pal Talk. 
[00:48:30]  I just happened to take a little look-see.  What's with Opie's new haircut?  Is it picture day?  My brother's getting married Sunday.  I had to get a haircut.  Leave me alone.  Nice hair, dude.  Huh?  I don't know.  I didn't even think anyone noticed.  I did.  You did?  Pal Talk did.  When you were bouncing off cabs.  No, there's regular cars, just bouncing, showing off.  Bouncing off the cars.  Like Hubert, my friend would think I was cool. 
[00:49:00]  By the way, I gave Stephen S. from Bayshore the big invite to the bachelor party Friday.  Wow.  At FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  Well, and now you just gave it to everybody.  I don't know.  Well, my brother Elmo wants to invite everybody.  Yeah.  My brother Quinn doesn't want to invite everybody.  Brett's thinking, ah, good business opportunity.  Might as well use my...  Yeah, I'm sure.  He's always thinking business.  He's like, might as well use my own bachelor party to get a few shekels in the cash register. 
[00:49:30]  So I don't know.  But I gave Stephen S. from Bayshore the big invite.  Wow.  Officially, yeah.  Look how important Stephen S. is becoming.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212.  You know, I have a fun fact.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I always step on the phone number.  Do the phone number again.  I always step on it.  No!  It's one...  What?  8-6 or 8-7-7.  What is it?  8-7-7. 
[00:50:00]  Mm-hmm.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  There you go.  You're...  Fall in.  No.  No.  No.  I have a fun...  It's 8-7-7-212.  Q-O-N-A.  Oh, that makes sense.  Yeah.  I have a fun fact about Steve from Bayshore.  Ah!  He gave me Jack-Jack.  Okay, terrific.  Little Jack-Jack, the...  Your kitty.  The cat.  That's wonderful. 
[00:50:30]  That's sweet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a sweet cat.  Sure he is.  Yeah.  I have a fun fact about space I wanted to tell.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  But no one cares.  Fact.  Go ahead.  Guys.  When things go through black holes, they're compressed to what they call, I think it's singularity.  Yes.  The Earth's singularity, if you were to squeeze it, is about, I think, a foot and a half.  Ew.  If you were to squeeze the Earth, it would weigh as much as it does now and be a foot and  a half.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:51:00]  Long.  Can I follow up your fun fact?  Because that one was really good.  So I've got to show my knowledge now.  Okay.  The big yellow one's the sun.  That's true.  It's true.  Yeah.  I think that's a better fact.  Yeah, because your fact is just creeping everybody out.  No, no, no, no.  Because, Anthony, you're trying to say the whole...  Let's just take the Grand Canyon.  You throw that through a black hole, it's less than a foot.  Well, the whole Earth is.  It weighs the same, yeah.  That's what a neutron star is.  See, what happens is when a star really does expand and then collapse on itself, it all 
[00:51:30]  condenses.  Ooh, it's so much matter in such a small amount of time.  That a mere teaspoon of its matter, you wouldn't even be able to hold it up.  It weighs as much as a mountain.  You wouldn't even be able to lift a teaspoon of the material.  And they spin very rapidly.  And the gravity gets so strong that not even light can escape.  That's a black hole.  That's a black hole. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I'm not talking about black holes.  But that's a star.  A black hole starts as a star.  It does.  But a black hole...  A black hole is a star that collapses and kind of becomes a black hole.  A neutron star is not a black hole.  It's one step smaller.  Yeah.  It's different.  I'm just saying a black hole.  Now I'm changing to another fun fact.  Oh, okay.  That a black hole is a star that's collapsed on itself so much that its gravity is so strong  that even light, even light itself... 
[00:52:30]  I got a fun fact.  Photons of light cannot escape.  I got a black hole fun fact.  Okay.  A black hole allows you to do racial humor on the radio.  Oh, wow.  This is true.  Oh.  Amen.  Do you know I have a fun fact?  Another fun fact?  Because we're talking about space.  Hold on.  You know, too many fun facts coming in.  We got to reset with the fun fact sweeper.  Opie and Anthony's Fun Fact Thursday. 
[00:53:00]  Fun Fact Thursday.  Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Thursday.  Featuring, but not necessarily, specifically limited to fan.  Years.  Dan.  Sometimes, but not every time.  Well, this time, this was handed to me by a fan.  Oh, okay.  So it is.  Yeah.  And it is true.  Yes.  The sun could have already gone out.  What?  We would not know for eight and a half minutes. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God, dude.  My heart just skipped a beat.  The sun could be black as coal right now.  And we're not going to know until 7.20?  It would be perfect for the radio show, though.  Wouldn't even know it.  7.20 is the big get every morning.  7.20.  Who's going to beat that?  Then we would know that the sun went out.  That we're on the radio when we officially find out that the sun did go out.  Because even at the ridiculous speed of light, it still takes eight and a half minutes for  that light to reach us over here. 
[00:54:00]  Let's wait eight and a half minutes to see.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Let's see if the sun went out.  That's a great show we have.  We just sit and wait to see.  Wouldn't that be something?  What a hell of a coincidence that would be if the sun did go out just as we said that.  Yeah.  It'd be very cold.  It sure would.  What would mankind do?  I don't know, but I bet you Bic would go, their stock would go through the roof.  We'd try something.  We would try something.  We would try something.  We're not just going to lay down and go, oh God, everybody's got to die. 
[00:54:30]  But you know everyone's got to die.  I would guess that we would just launch all the nukes.  And where the sun used to be and try to get it started?  They would do something.  What is this, Armageddon?  They would try to stop Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi up there to do something?  They found out the sun is done.  You got eight and a half minutes.  You release the nukes and hope that that keeps the earth warm until you can figure out the  next thing.  Jesus.  What a dumb plan. 
[00:55:00]  You'd have to start doing stuff down here.  All right.  So many people just buy it.  Only the rich have to be alive.  The poor would just be dead.  Well, you would use the poor to heat the earth.  Oh, hold on.  Like the matrix.  Yeah.  We hook them up to heat pumps.  Yeah.  And take their body heat.  Yeah.  I like the way you're thinking.  How could we get that technology within the time that it would take for this planet to  freeze over? 
[00:55:30]  Oh, it would freeze so fast.  I know where I'd go immediately.  Where?  It's a place by my apartment.  It's called Ted's Match Emporium.  There would be a line out of that place.  It would take so long to make a transaction.  Every match head, it's carved like Ted's face.  Is it Pot Talk Thursday?  No, that's Monday.  Damn it.  I know.  Trust me, I'm holding back.  I was so stoned, I forgot.  Let's go to Larry in New York City.  Larry! 
[00:56:00]  Larry!  Fun fact.  Yes, Larry!  Did you know that sperm flies at a rate of 49 miles per hour?  Sperm flies at 49 miles an hour?  I would think that depends on the age and the health of the guy.  But is that average speed?  So you're saying some might hit 80?  A young buck?  Sure.  Because you know some are doing three.  An old codger?  An old codger, it's got to be three miles per.  Especially if the old guy doesn't mean for them to be moving at all. 
[00:56:30]  Actually, he sneezes.  An old codger?  Just picture a volcano.  I call it a volcano.  Yeah, that isn't the swimming action, I'm sure.  Hey, you know what?  I'm going to throw another fun fact out there.  I'm buzzing by like a jet ski.  Actually, I'm going to do a real one from Steve Jobs himself.  Steve Jobs?  Over 100 million iPods sold.  Excellent fun fact.  That's coming in today.  I have a fun fact from Steve Jobs as well.  Oh, boy.  Yeah?  That if you want to download info on the iPhone, just write a letter. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, Vince, by the way, is spoiling my little thing here.  He's from Bayonne.  He goes, Opie, the Great Canyon is empty, so we'll collapse to nothing.  I'll just be in big things, though.  Yeah.  Size-wise.  Volume.  Well, the Great Canyon is, yeah, it's empty inside, but the sides are pretty impressive.  I've been there.  Of course.  Pretty impressive.  Got pictures and stuff.  Hey, what are we going to do here? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, Roland is going to talk about his Clinton sighting at Starbucks, but first we do have  the Booby Chew commercial that we promised two days ago, I believe.  This is an actual commercial.  Booby Chew.  Booby Chew, yeah.  Booby Chew, and this was a commercial from the 80s.  Early 80s parody commercial.  Oh, it's a parody commercial?  We hate parody commercials.  Oh, God.  You know something?  Thank God.  Because I was just going to say, I consider myself an expert in television, especially 
[00:58:00]  from the 70s and 80s, and commercials, and I do not remember this at all, and I would  have remembered this.  This will leave to the hypnosis that we have had on our show.  Let's just play this first, and then we'll talk about the fine hypnosis and what he used  to do on our show.  Oh, God.  And he used to do it for many radio shows across America.  Yeah.  He was traveling full-time to be on radio shows to do this unbelievable thing.  But first, it's the Booby Chew. 
[00:58:30]  Booby Chew, choo, choo, Booby Chew.  Booby Chew will work for you.  Choo, choo, choo, they grew and grew.  Quick Booby Chew to work for you.  Choo, choo, choo, choo, Booby Chew.  Choo, Booby Chew.  And buzz on through.  Choo, choo, choo, choo, Booby Chew.  Yes, Booby Chew.  We'll throw on you.  You'll be booby.  You'll be to baby.  You'll be booby.  You'll be booby.  Booby Chew will throw on you.  Choo, choo, choo.  Booby Chew, hormone gum doubles your measure, doubles your gun.  Now available for boys. 
[00:59:00]  I want to apologize to our audience.  We teased this for two days.  Are you...  me?  Who's responsible for that?  I want someone's head.  You do?  I want someone's head to roll for that one.  Oh, boy.  Who heard that and thought it was a commercial, first of all?  Are we actually going to see it?  Because at least if it was a real commercial, it would have been a little weird and strange 
[00:59:30]  and...  Are we going to actually see you fire your drinking partner?  I've done that before.  Oh, no.  No.  Was it?  Yeah.  You're going to have to fire your drinking partner.  Christ almighty.  There he comes.  What?  First of all, he comes in with a first of all before anyone said a thing.  You can't say first of all with one arm.  Okay, fine.  You got me there.  First of all.  First of all.  You can't be too threatening when your big right hook is...  I'll hit you with my giant knuckle.  I know.  Look at his... 
[01:00:00]  He's got one knuckle right in the middle.  Danny, what happened?  What was that?  I found a link on Fark Videos for Boobie Chew.  I thought it was kind of appropriate for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I didn't think...  Oh, this is the most...  This is going to be the hottest thing on the internet.  But did you think it was a real commercial?  No.  Not at all.  How come we were told for two days that that was an actual commercial from the 80s?  It does say parody.  I did write it right on the disc that it's a parody commercial.  All right.  Did you think it was a fun parody? 
[01:00:30]  That's a good first of all.  No, I didn't find it particularly hysterical.  It was just so ridiculous and obnoxious that I thought it would work well for this radio program.  Hmm.  Sam is disagreeing verbally.  Oh, wow.  Well, Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station, he's got a fun fact.  Boobie Chew sucks a blank blank.  That's right.  Oh.  Yeah, well.  Hmm.  Hmm. 
[01:01:00]  Thank you.  Wow.  We teased that.  I didn't tell anybody to tease that.  Oh, wow.  He's coming out in defensive mode.  For two days, we teased that.  I got to take responsibility because it's a parody.  Are you?  It does say parody?  But I've been caught up in that love thing and maybe it wasn't too close or something.  I don't know.  See, because that's just that I thought it was going to be a real commercial.  Me too.  Like the AIDS commercial.  I could bring AIDS.  Remember the AIDS diet plan commercial? 
[01:01:30]  That's real.  Well, where is it?  Iraq?  We could play that.  Iraq's going.  Where are you going?  What did you just...  What are you wandering off to?  What are you out of your mind?  Where are you walking?  What the hell is going on here?  The only...  First of all, the only reason I said that...  I'll pull down a wall here.  Which wall, though?  You did eight yesterday.  All right.  I'm going to pull down the third wall.  I'm going in a little because I want to see the other side.  But you're actually tearing down a real wall.  Yeah, I know.  The whole bit works when you say the eighth or ninth because... 
[01:02:00]  I said nine yesterday.  How many rooms have nine walls?  All right, I'm tearing down half the ceiling.  Half the ceiling.  All right.  The only reason I said that is because up on the screen that Iraq types in on, it said  AIDS commercial, 1980.  Right.  So I'm thinking, oh, that's good.  It's a good thing to show what a real ridiculous commercial, but it was a real commercial from  the 80s would sound like as opposed to the booby chew, which was a parody.  So as I brought it up, Iraq gets up and walks away. 
[01:02:30]  Can I tear down the rest of the ceiling?  The reason I went there was to save this segment.  To try to give a little something.  Because the people out there in their cars right now are like, oh, wow.  I want them to forget booby chew and remember AIDS.  We actually had people starting to think that maybe they should go check out Whoopi.  Booby chew was funny.  Booby chew.  Stop it.  I would like to hear that laugh.  I hear it again.  Have a few laughs.  I think booby chew was funny. 
[01:03:00]  I don't think booby chew is going to get another second of airplay.  Jimmy, I will play it as long as you sing along to it.  Of course I will.  Okay, Jimmy.  That might add to it.  All right, Jimmy.  Let's see if this helps.  Let's see Jimmy just kind of la, la, la.  Riff.  Riff with it.  I'll sing it for real.  It's booby chew.  Booby chew.  Booby chew will work for you.  Get on mic.  Juju.  Juju.  Juju.  If the knee lives next to you.  No.  It's booby chew.  It's booby chew.  What does he say there? 
[01:03:30]  You know, I am thinking about it.  We have some very talented listeners out there.  Let's try to save this.  We all know that booby chew sucks up.  According to, who was it?  Everyone.  Everyone.  At this point, everyone on instant feedback.  Maybe they could send in their own version of the booby chew song.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Eric, where were you going?  Yeah, where were you going?  Did you think, imagine that you met Bill Clinton and it had the same reaction? 
[01:04:00]  You had to go duty?  Congratulations, son.  I'm getting married.  Did you have to?  Hey, congrats.  I read it on FMQB.  Did you have a meeting with a baker for your upcoming wedding?  Yeah, what happened?  Where were you going?  No, it's just my luck.  You guys were talking.  I figured I could go do something real quick.  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't say something.  We're on the air.  No, don't say something.  Where were you going?  You can say it, Eric.  All right, at 720, we were going to kill all the lights and drop the curtain thing there. 
[01:04:30]  You can't sell anything.  I was going to help you, too, just by doing the curtain thing, because we were going to  simulate the actual extinguishing of the sun at 720.  Oh, my God.  So, he was on his way to hit the lights.  Oh.  Why don't we get it over with and just turn this into a morning zoo?  And then we all would have forgotten what we were talking about.  Exactly.  We would have said, all right, why'd you turn the lights on?  What are you doing?  Turn the lights on, idiot.  I can't see my banana.  By the way, let it be noted, in the middle of the last thing I said on the radio, I just 
[01:05:00]  bit the hell out of my tongue.  Nice.  I don't want pineapple?  That hurts.  Oh, that would feel great.  I don't like pineapple.  Pineapple.  Oh, no.  I told Kenny, I don't like pineapple.  Why are you throwing pineapple?  Because I don't want pineapple.  I feel that way about grapefruit.  Really?  Grapefruit ruins every other fruit in the little fruit thing.  I don't like that thing.  No, melon does.  No, melon's great.  Hold on a second.  Melon sucks up.  Steve Sharippa's shirt just came in. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I thought I'd give you a little treat today.  I don't like it.  I forgot.  I'm sorry.  It's the next Chocolate Rain.  It might be stuck in my head.  You know, he did break Chocolate Rain.  Yeah, Danny officially broke Chocolate Rain.  We've got to give him credit for breaking Chocolate Rain.  I mean, great.  It was all over YouTube.  But we broke it.  I don't know. 
[01:06:00]  No one was really talking about it.  Honestly, I really think Danny...  Very early on that one.  I really do think Danny started the Chocolate Rain phenomenon.  Chocolate Rain.  I mean, what...  I don't know if Boobie Chew is going to have the legs that Chocolate Rain had.  Are you kidding me?  It's going to be the next phenomenon on internet.  Phenomenon.  You know what?  Okay.  Get in my machine.  Now, we're going to get Boobie Chew stuck in everyone's head.  No.  Man, we're going to play some fine, fine versions of Boobie Chew.  There's a video for it in the coming days.  Nice big watermark on it.  We'll farm it out to all the viral websites. 
[01:06:30]  I'm sure Steven has.  I'm sure.  Yes.  This is Foundry's Boobie Chew.  Danny just threw a little jab at the boss.  I like that.  He threw a little jab at stupid in there.  Did you call Steve a boss?  That's really funny.  He's Danny's superior.  Is he?  Is he?  Morally.  I don't know.  Size-wise.  All right.  Well, why don't we play the AIDS commercial from 1980 so we can save this break?  Yeah.  Unless Z-Rock wants to go somewhere.  This is actually, for the people that haven't heard this yet, you should have heard it by 
[01:07:00]  now if you listen to this show.  You should linger longer if you haven't.  This is an actual commercial from 1980.  Yeah.  AIDS was a chocolate candy diet plan.  My mom used to have it.  Your mom had AIDS?  My mom had AIDS back in the early 80s, and I used to eat my mother's AIDS.  It was in the...  Did you really?  Sometimes I would be so hungry for a nice treat that I would eat my mother's AIDS, and she would 
[01:07:30]  get mad that I ate her AIDS because she wanted all the AIDS for herself.  You know, I'm going to confess something, too.  I used to eat my mom's sugarless chocolate.  Ugh.  What, for baking?  Yeah.  Did she use it for baking?  I would go into the cupboard.  Unsweetened chocolate.  It's like wax.  And it looked like it would be a tasty treat.  Didn't it look like a nice Hershey bar or something?  And I would sneak in there and eat my mom's sugarless chocolate. 
[01:08:00]  And for some reason, you keep eating it.  How disappointing was that, man?  You take a bite, and it's just nothing.  Jimmy's going to confess something.  No, no, no.  But sugarless chocolate, it's like a vaginalist woman.  All right.  So here's the AIDS commercial from 1980.  This is not a parody.  This was an actual commercial that used to be played.  And then that disease messed up this company a little bit.  Right.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12. 
[01:08:30]  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Ah, yes.  The funny part is that the product is mentioned so much.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  They don't just say it and show it.  You just can't stop saying AIDS.  Like he knew.  By the way, they're already working on their versions of the booby chew.  And let's just say the first ones coming in have something to do with Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Is it duty?  Duty.  Did that make the radio?  It should, right?  Yeah.  Duty?  Of course.  Yeah, well, they're thinking of new versions of that song featuring Jimmy Norton. 
[01:09:30]  But let's get this song stuck in everyone's head today.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  I know you want to sing.  Let's go.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And we'll be back with the Opium Anthony show. 
[01:10:00]  Hormone gum doubles your measure, doubles your gun.  Now available for boys.  Who beats you?  We'll throw our new.  Choo cho cho.  Where's Roland?  If you're checking out the Opium Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Uh.  Philly, keep listening to WISP, please.  Big visit next week.  Doing two shows live from Philly next week, Thursday and Friday, leading up to the last  virus show for a while. 
[01:10:30]  Tickets still available for the Camden show.  Uh.  Virus tour, one word on MySpace.  But basically, go to Ticketmaster, get your tickets.  It's going to be a great, great night in Camden.  Especially with us coming into Philly a couple days early.  It's going to be a lot of activity down there in Philly.  And then I'm here and we're going up to Boston in the near future.  What?  I think we're doing a little Halloween thing with BCN up there.  Wow.  Details coming together nicely.  And then we're saying, why aren't we going to Chicago? 
[01:11:00]  We need to go to Chicago.  I agree.  We said we would hit Chicago in the fall.  Well, the fall is here.  Steve Dahl wants us to come.  He'd be very supportive of that.  So I would love to go out there.  Yeah, we've got to figure something out for Chicago as well.  Great city.  And then we're going to have to figure something out for Syracuse and Pittsburgh.  And we should go back to Cleveland.  And then we should go to Buffalo.  We've got to go to Buffalo.  I know.  We haven't been in Buffalo since the big...  Since the incident. 
[01:11:30]  T&A with O&A.  The one we were going to get in big trouble for if we didn't get into bigger trouble very shortly after.  That was the bit we were supposed to get fired for.  Yep.  They were ready to fire us for that.  Oh, were they ready.  And then we...  Oh, were they ready.  And then we made it real easy for everybody.  They wouldn't have, though, fired you for that because it was a Saturday.  That's the only thing that would have saved the show is that it was a Saturday.  Oh, yeah?  It'll be in our book, Jimmy.  It'll be in our book.  Yep.  What?  What?  What?  We got Roland coming into the studio. 
[01:12:00]  Where's his song?  Where's his...  When you need radio, Roland, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  Yep.  The one you can count on the book, I guess, for a session.  But ends every single sentence he says in a question.  No pronunciation, so spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonaduce, Bonaduce, check him out Friday-wide.  It's Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  It's Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  It's Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  It's Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland. 
[01:12:30]  I mean, that action, suspense.  The beauty of the Roland rap...  Yeah.  ...is right after that energy, you get this lump.  But I was watching him as the song was playing, and he didn't look happy.  No.  He kind of had his head down.  He was just...  Because he even knows how awful he is.  Oh, Roland.  I know.  Hi, Roland.  How are you?  I'm well.  We all got an email yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  And I went to Starbucks and met Quintone. 
[01:13:00]  Now, you went to Starbucks.  Yeah, I was coming looking for apartments to move into.  So I came back.  You went to Starbucks to look for an apartment?  No, no.  I came back.  A pastry display?  No.  Little cakes.  He's going to live where they put the little cakes.  We've got two cinnamon cakes and a Roland.  Don't mind them.  I mean, I was just waiting in line, and I was next.  I didn't know what I wanted.  Like, what do you want?  I go, I don't know. 
[01:13:30]  So I was looking, and I just felt somebody tap me.  He goes, do you mind if I cut in line?  I was like, I don't care.  And then I looked up.  It was Clinton.  How many people were in line, by the way?  Probably six, five, six.  You couldn't wait for six people?  Did they...  He's the most powerful man in the world.  No, because everybody was, like, pulling out their cell phones, trying to get pictures with them.  Was he okay with that?  Yeah, he took pictures, signed autographs.  Why didn't you get a picture with the president?  The ex-president.  Bathroom.  You know what you should have told him?  I had to go to the bathroom.  Oh, well, you'll get the picture the next time.  Yeah, next time you see him. 
[01:14:00]  You bump into him.  Dude, cut, double cut.  I would have made him cut, double cut.  What's cut, double cut?  Remember cut, double cut?  Where your friend would come up online, and he says, can I cut?  And then he cuts in front of you, which has to be okay with everyone behind you, because he's cutting in front of you.  And you say, cut, double cut.  And then you go in front of him.  So what you're actually doing is letting your friend cut the guy behind you.  Cut, double cut, the worst thing ever.  And you're like, you can't cut, double cut. 
[01:14:30]  You just cut me.  No, it's cut, double cut.  Oh, sorry.  You just cut me?  Cut, double cut.  I'm saying cut, double cut.  See, Tim heard it, too.  Cut, double cut, you cunt.  And catch it down the hall.  Wait a minute.  That was a little iffy.  Yeah, that was close.  See, that one, you really see.  He walked over to the Park Meridian afterwards, signing, taking pictures with people.  He went to the Park Meridian?  I don't know.  Is he still in town?  Wow.  He should be.  Wait, did he go into the Parker?  Yeah, he went into the Parker. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, that means he's staying there.  What if he had breakfast?  That's good.  I like how you just give away the security of one of the ex-presidents of the United States.  He probably didn't say that.  He might have walked through there.  Yeah, he probably met somebody there.  Or he walked through.  Met somebody at a hotel?  What are you speculating?  Wow.  You heard it here first.  Roland's saying that the ex-president is having an affair.  Steamy, hot affair at the Park Meridian Hotel.  While his wife is running for the presidency.  Wow.  Yeah.  So wait, Roland, he taps you and he goes, can I cut?  What do you say?  Sure.  And then he orders his coffee. 
[01:15:30]  He goes, can you get this kid something?  I said, I guess I'll take a vodka.  This kid?  This kid?  Did he call you a kid?  Well, because everybody else behind me was like 80 years old.  Did he, did he, uh, you, you had the urge to go to the bathroom?  Well, it just like, once he ordered, he puts his arm around and people are asking questions.  Like, hey, how are you?  And I, the one, I guess, can you take a picture with me?  He goes, sure.  And then I head to the bathroom.  You head right to the bathroom.  I had to take a huge, really, I have nothing to say to a politician. 
[01:16:00]  Like, hey, good bill.  Good bill.  I don't know what else.  Yeah, but I mean, how about hi?  I guess.  Well, how about, can I have a picture?  How about, are you enjoying New York?  I don't know, something.  I got nothing for politicians.  I just like, so.  All right.  Bringing back memories, you know, being on the road, campaign trail, because I've seen  him with his wife on a couple of these things.  It's like, you know, does it make you want to get back into the fray?  There are a few things you could ask that man.  Instead of going, excuse me, I got a duty. 
[01:16:30]  How about we do a little play acting with Roland?  Yeah.  All the presidents.  Like, let's, I mean, do you have a game?  Uh, no.  I'm a Bush senior.  President Bush is at Starbucks.  What would you say to President Bush?  Wow.  Yeah.  An opportunity to talk to him.  Um.  Anything.  Go ahead.  Hey.  Enjoy your coffee.  Wow.  How about not being controversial?  How about Jimmy Carter? 
[01:17:00]  He's online.  He taps you on the shoulder.  You're like, oh my God, that's Jimmy Carter.  Um.  Hey, I heard you got a book out.  Nice.  A book out?  A book out.  He has a book.  Oh, a book out.  Oh, a book out.  You should enunciate when you're speaking with them.  What about the great communicator?  What would you say to the great communicator?  Ronald Reagan.  Obviously dead, but he's online.  He taps you on the shoulder.  I met him when I was a little kid, though.  What?  I met him when I was a little kid, yeah.  You met Reagan?  Reagan.  And Bush senior?  Carter.  And, uh, Powell and Al Gore. 
[01:17:30]  And how many pictures do you have of these people?  I mean, uh, because when you work at SNL, then my dad had friends who were politicians.  How was the duty when you met, uh, when you met Ronald Reagan?  I mean, I was just a kid.  I just, all I told him was I was, I was hungry.  Of course.  Wow.  Yes.  Yeah.  That hasn't stopped.  Did you get pictures?  That won't stop for years.  I haven't.  My mom has a Reagan picture.  Wait, you've met five U.S. or four U.S. presidents?  Just Reagan, Carter, Clinton, Bush senior. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  That's four U.S. presidents and you don't have pictures with any of them?  What a waste.  Just one.  I just.  Just one.  But you have the memories, right?  What's up with this Forrest Gump thing that happens to you?  I don't know.  You call it your Forrest Gump moment when you meet politicians.  Well, that's, all my friends get mad because they really want to meet them and I wander  around and I get to meet them and they hate it because they would ask me questions and  take pictures and they go, you're the guy who gets to meet them.  So that's fun.  But you also have to like go to the bathroom.  I do.  I get nervous.  You get nervous stomach.  You get sour stomach.  I do. 
[01:18:30]  And then I just.  Did you have to run into the bathroom?  I did.  Yeah.  I know.  And I can, when I met Al Gore, the guy's like, hey, go talk to Roland.  He goes, hey, how are you?  He's like, I'm good.  I go, I got to, I'll be back in a minute.  Al Gore.  So wait, would you have taken a photo of some, you have, you have, you have a camera on that?  No.  How did you not get a picture?  Well, these are.  He had to duty.  By the way.  Is there a nervous stomach churning?  I do.  It's a former president.  I get it.  Whatever.  You still would call him Mr. President.  No, you call him Mr. President. 
[01:19:00]  You don't have to say former president.  I know.  I said ex-president.  It's a technicality.  We all know he's the former president.  You don't even have to say former.  All right.  I apologize.  You just say President Clinton.  That's right.  Hello, Mr. President.  They are still, you still give them that title.  Poor Pete of the Rez.  Well, that's a great moment for you, Roland.  Yeah.  It's an awful moment for him, though.  Awful moment for the toilet.  No.  Yeah, I guess I mean, I like God.  But we also want you to leave a grande double espresso.  More than that, Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  Perhaps more than that.  Roland, are you ready to do our tribute to Pavarotti today?  I think so.  Pavarotti.  By the way, Don Wicklund gave me a breaking news email.  Oh, wow.  Only 15 minutes ago that Pavarotti died.  Thanks for listening to the show, Don.  We pretty much started the show off with it.  Ah, he's great.  It is big news.  He must have been busy.  71 years old.  Pancreatic cancer got him, right?  Yeah.  And we want Roland. 
[01:20:00]  No, can we set up a mic for Roland and some freaking reverb?  Did he?  Reverb.  What happened?  Did he send it to the whole company on the email?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, way to go.  Breaking news.  Which one are we going to use?  Either one is ready for reverb.  All right.  Roland, talk into that.  I want to see if we got some nice reverb for you.  Hello.  Hello.  Say it again.  What?  Hello.  You got it?  I think so. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  All right.  Get your headphones on.  This is Roland.  He's doing his big...  Get this nice boy a coffee on me.  Could you get him a...  That's fantastic.  Get this kid?  Yeah, this kid.  He put his arm around you?  Yeah, because he was talking to people.  Did he smell good?  I was just going to answer that.  He did.  He smelled good, right?  Yeah.  What did he smell like?  Like...  Deliciousness?  I don't know.  Oh my God.  That isn't quite what I was looking for. 
[01:21:00]  Bill Clinton smells like deliciousness.  Deliciousness.  I was thinking, you know, high karate.  What?  You weren't smelling a cinnamon bun, were you, at the time?  One that was right under your nose as you were stuffing your face?  No.  It just like...  How long did he have his arm around you for?  Just for like a few seconds.  Did he leave a little, like, of his armpit?  Was it on your shoulder?  No.  And then when you went, sniffed your shoulder, did you smell Clinton all day? 
[01:21:30]  No, he just looked like this.  And he went, hmm, pretty good.  Did he look confident in person?  Deliciousness.  He did.  He just, like, people, like, when they had a camera, he goes, do you want to use that  camera?  Come over.  I want to use that camera.  Yeah, especially with Hillary running right now.  He's going to be nice to everybody.  Yeah.  Time to get a photo of Clinton.  Absolutely.  He will not say no now.  And neither will she.  All right.  Well, Roland.  Roland screwed it up.  We got to head to break here, but Roland's got to, like, do Pavarotti proud on his passing. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  So you're going to sing what today?  Ave Maria.  Ah, one of the favorites.  One of my favorites, too.  Of Pavarotti.  Right.  Yes, this is a big one.  Yeah, this is a big one for Roland.  He really knows this stuff.  Who knew?  He's a big opera fan, opera singer.  You're going to belt this out, right?  Yeah.  Do we have some Pavarotti, just to give everybody a little taste of what it's supposed to sound like?  All right. 
[01:22:30]  The great Pavarotti.  So that nice build, beautiful music.  Wait for it.  Uh, what? 
[01:23:00]  That guy's pretty good.  I think this kid's got potential.  I do agree.  This guy can bring his toilet wherever he wants and be on a voice like that.  He is that.  Belting out a tune.  Yeah.  All right, I think we got enough of what it's supposed to sound like. 
[01:23:30]  Roland, you got to do Pavarotti proud today, okay?  I will.  All right, now do you know where to come in?  Sure.  All right, here we go.  I think I do.  Roland doing Pavarotti.  It's a little musical.  Oh, one more wheel. 
[01:24:00]  Maria, gratia, plenia.  Maria, gratia, plenia.  Maria, gratia, plenia. 
[01:24:30]  Ave, ave, dominus.  Dominus tecum benita to inmoversia et to benedicia et to fructus ventris, ventris to Jesus, Ave Maria.  Ave Maria, Mata de Oropornobius, Oropornobus, Oropornobus, Oropornobus, Oropornobus, 
[01:25:00]  et inhora mortris nostra, et inhora mortris, et inhora mortris notoris, Ave Maria. 
[01:25:30]  Ave Maria, Mata de Oropornobus.  Oh, my God. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, wow.  You think he'll get an 11-minute standing ovation?  Bravo!  Bravo!  Bravo!  Bravo!  El Fatso!  El Fatso.  I am the werewolf!  I like to make werewolf movies! 
[01:26:30]  He sounded like singing.  Hey, wow, what can you say about that?  Oh, well, you know, I'm just glad we can give him a send-off like that.  Yes.  Pavarotti, give him the tribute he so deserved.  In that rendition of one of his classic songs, Ave Maria, as done by our own Roland, I Have  to Take a Dump, whatever your last name is.  Let me ask you a question.  I told this to my chick yesterday.  Would you be mad at your girlfriend, Ben Clinton? 
[01:27:00]  I told her I would almost understand it.  Like, I wouldn't consider it cheating.  I'm like, if we were in Starbucks and you met him and you went into the bathroom with him.  You're cuckold.  No, but I'm not.  I have no...  But I would probably just let her do it.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Why not?  That's those deals that couples make.  The deal, like, that would be her freebie and then you would have to be able to have  one.  I love when you're like...  Yeah.  I love when you run into a fat chick and she'll say something like, me and my husband have 
[01:27:30]  one.  Yeah, we got a deal.  Mine's George Clooney.  Yeah.  You'll let me have sex with George Clooney.  That's great.  You know what I mean?  She's just a slob.  She's a big slob and she's all excited like, we both have one.  Mine's Brad Pitt.  Yeah, well...  You know...  Who's his?  That chick he works with.  All those dumb deals that married couples do.  Stop it. 
[01:28:00]  We're faithful to each other, but we both have one.  You know, we're loud.  Yeah, like Clooney's gonna run for that pig.  Bang some freaking house...  Yeah.  Soccer mom from freaking Bayshore.  Yeah, okay.  We each have ours.  You know, mine's all...  Well, let me tell you, mine is...  Forget about it.  Right.  Leave for him in a second for him.  Oh, would you?  Is that your freebie?  People are suggesting that Roland's opera becomes a new ringtone. 
[01:28:30]  Not a bad idea.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Photo-op diarrhea.  He said photo-op diarrhea.  I love it.  Well, anyone else want to do a little opera today in honor of Pavarotti?  Now I smell a new bit.  Look at this.  These bits are just flying all over the place today. 
[01:29:00]  Let's say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  I'll talk in the Starbucks bathroom, too.  Yeah, Keith.  Yeah.  Sound like Roland was singing in pig Latin.  Punch it out.  All right.  By the way, Awful Me is saying that Jimmy has one.  You know, one person you're allowed to have sex with.  Yes.  And that would be me.  No.  That's what Awful Me is saying.  That's not.  I think they're going back to the dream where you're cute birding over the cars.  No, but it wasn't sexual.  Well, and let's hope Jimmy has one. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  And a lot of people are asking, why didn't Roland try to book Clinton for the show?  Yeah, Roland, you are the official booker of the Opian Ampest.  Yeah, that would have been a good one.  That would have been a nice get right there.  Imagine if he said, I heard those guys.  They're funny.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's heard of the show.  I love that show.  God.  He's heard of it.  Those boys are funny.  He's only doing TV at this.  What?  Are you great?  What?  What?  He has a book tour?  Yeah, he's only doing television.  When's he doing a signing?  I think this week.  Could he get Jimmy to the signing? 
[01:30:00]  No.  He just flat out said no.  All right, Roland, get out of here.  Can we do the Roland rap?  We got on the way after the break, Rob Bartlett, a good friend of the radio show.  Oh, great.  Yes.  From Imus' old radio show.  He's coming by to say hi.  Nice.  And I'll tell you right now, I know he's listening in the green room.  You come in here as Brian Wilson to start your whole thing.  Love the Brian Wilson.  And then we'll see what Rob's up to, and he's plugging a gig.  He's just a really good friend of the show.  And also Eddie Griffin.  Yeah, we'll talk about Eddie Griffin.  It'll be perfect with Rob Bartlett.  Exactly.  It'll be perfect with Rob Bartlett. 
[01:30:30]  But first, Roland's leaving.  Where's his exit music?  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book, a guest for a session.  But ends every single sentence he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft-spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, Bonadeus, check him out Friday-wide.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling. 
[01:31:00]  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's good.  I mean, that action, suspense.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show?  Trying to come up with different ways to come back to the show,  and I just did the same one.  Here he comes, Rob Bartlett.  I mean, Brian Wilson has head to the studio, baby.  Maybe Anthony can do I miss so he can feel at home.  There's candy on the floor. 
[01:31:30]  He has plenty of candy on the floor.  Plenty of candy on the floor, yes.  We're celebrating Sam's birthday.  Little Sam's birthday.  Disneyland here.  Yeah, it certainly is.  You got a balloon, too.  Oh, that's nice.  I already ate, thanks.  Hey, O.P., how are you?  I'm fine.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you?  Yes, I'm flattered.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, thank you.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Well, where are all the naked ladies?  Yeah, well, that seems to be a problem.  What's the story?  All the time birthdays, naked ladies, the day I show up,  it's piñatas and candy.  Yeah, well, we have a stripper pole if you want to, like, you know.  Yeah, well.  If you want to, like, dance.  There won't be a girl on it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay, it's been great.  Thanks, guys.  And there he goes.  You want us to play Imus' music, make you feel at home there, Rob? 
[01:32:30]  Anthony can do a fine Imus for you.  I know.  Yeah, always fun doing that.  Huh?  The best Imus in the business.  Thank you, sir.  You're very welcome.  I can't believe all this time I finally get to meet you.  Man, I met you years ago with Adam.  Oh, at Eastside?  It was, like, way back, yeah.  That was totally the day.  At Eastside.  I wouldn't remember.  Yeah, right?  Me neither.  Not in those days.  You were partaking, as they say?  Well, I don't know partaking, just, you know, so self-involved.  Oh, okay.  Oh, who are you?  You can do nothing for him. 
[01:33:00]  At least he's being honest.  Adam's friend?  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're fine.  Yeah.  I need to talk to Adam.  Took Adam under his wing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And he doesn't ride.  He doesn't call.  No.  He's a big star in Rescue Me.  Rescue Me.  Thank you very much.  And you're out of a radio gig.  Life isn't fair, right, Rob?  It's not fair.  It's not fair.  And congratulations.  Thank you, sir.  May your first child be a masculine child.  Yes, he's engaged. 
[01:33:30]  He's engaged.  I know.  It was a big surprise for everybody.  E-Rock got engaged.  It wasn't a surprise for me.  I guess you guys weren't paying attention or something, because I was deep in love, man.  Oh, we know that.  The funny part, I was like, wow, this is a big surprise.  I'm like, really?  Did you pay attention at all in the last couple of years?  When you're deep in love, who wants to wreck it with marriage?  I think it's very telling that when you're doing all your little, what I did on summer vacation,  that the nurses I got engaged in, Anthony's was, I took a picture of an underage girl 
[01:34:00]  on a bikini.  Yeah.  It speaks volume.  Hey, she was in the background.  Yeah, fine.  Okay.  We're in different places.  We're in a younger girl that was in the foreground.  That's all I'm talking about.  We're in different places.  Hey, can I get serious for one second?  No.  Please?  Please?  Please?  All right.  Just a nice thank you to the message boards, FBA and WACBag.  Really?  A lot of congratulatory messages.  Messages and posts.  You're not allowed to thank both of those boards?  Are you crazy?  I know.  I know that's insane. 
[01:34:30]  I know.  I know.  It's like thanking the Soviet Union and the United States back in the 80s.  I understand that.  You're thanking George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden.  I understand that, but both boards are treating me very, very well with this whole engagement  thing and congratulating us, and it's very, very cool to read the post, and I appreciate  it.  That's good.  Check back tomorrow.  I really do.  I know, and they'll go back to saying something that I'll be mad at.  You ever read the message boards, Rob?  I try to avoid them at all costs. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  It gets a little tense in there.  A little?  Yeah.  People.  Yeah.  And we're all a bunch of self-absorbed asses anyway, so you can do good, feel good about  yourself, what you did, and then you read a couple of posts, and you're like, sons of  bitches.  You read over my brain.  Why do I care what this one jackass is saying?  Some shut-in in Jersey with nothing else to do.  And I'm not even going to give him the satisfaction.  You son of a group in there, y'all typing away.  If I ever see you, you're dead. 
[01:35:30]  They've been cool, though.  Do you guys have those message boards where they're analyzing the show every day, and you  read it, and you're like, eh.  It was the Pony Express, as our message board.  I don't think that the IMIS audience would spend that much time on a computer.  True.  Hey, is McCord still there?  Where?  Charles McCord was there for a while after.  Well, what happened was Boomer Siason took over with one of the sports guys, one of the 
[01:36:00]  Jersey guys, who used to be a sports guy when we worked with him.  Forgot his name, because there were a few of them.  Carlton or something?  Wouldn't that be funny if his name was Guy?  Yeah.  Guy Guy.  Guy, the sports guy.  And I guess, I was reading the paper that they officially let Charles McCord go.  Yeah.  He was there.  He was still there, right?  He was doing news for whoever was filling in, but now that they got the Boomer show to  replace the IMIS show, now Charles McCord, who's a great broadcaster, is out of work. 
[01:36:30]  Well, he'll be, I'm sure he's getting paid.  I mean, they don't have to screw McCord, I don't think.  Will they?  What do you think, he reads his contract?  Why would they screw you in radio, Jimmy?  That's crazy.  Why would you even say that?  That never happens in radio.  They acknowledge that you've been a good soldier for all those years, and they take care of  you.  You know that.  Boomer will be just as good as IMIS.  Just as many laughs.  That show's going to be a disaster.  Of course it is.  Our buddy Al Dukes is over there. 
[01:37:00]  I know we work for the same company, but come on.  Oh, it stinks.  I just want to say, I hope they didn't replace Al Dukes here at K-Rock yet.  Why?  Because...  Oh, you think he's coming back?  I think he's coming back.  That's how much faith I have.  You've got to give him a lot of credit.  You've got to give him a lot of credit.  A lot of credit.  A lot of credit.  So, Rob, are you bitter?  Let's get into some IMIS talk.  Are you bitter?  No.  Why would I be bitter?  Getting fired?  You close a door, God opens a window. 
[01:37:30]  And then you jump it out.  Jump out the freaking window.  It's, you know, the way everything went down was just, you know...  It still amazes me to this day.  It amazes me to this day.  It is what it is.  And we talked about it recently, and me and Jimmy, where were we?  In a cab or something, we're walking home, and I'm like, you know, Jimmy, I even tried  to see the other side of this.  Like, what the hell?  It's such a big story.  How could you see the other side when you got a cab?  Good point.  He's saying, how can you see the black point of view? 
[01:38:00]  Because the taxi stopped for us.  Good point, Anson.  All right.  I try to look into all the animals.  But it's like, it makes you so angry.  It's like, it makes my head hurt.  It's like, let me try to play devil's advocate.  Yeah, maybe there's something I'm missing.  Am I out of touch?  And I just don't see it, and I will never see it.  White devil's advocate.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  We all make mistakes.  And, you know, the thing that was...  There was no mistake there.  I know you have to say that because you're trying to get a gig. 
[01:38:30]  But I'm going to openly say there was no mistake there.  Everyone knew who Imus was, what he was about.  He did way worse.  We all do way worse.  And some stupid blogger started this, and it was an avalanche of...  That turned into a disaster, obviously.  And he was genuinely remorseful.  He really wanted to make amends with the girls.  And he...  A lot of people don't know that he...  He made those girls famous.  Well, even...  But even after the two firings, you know, he still showed up to apologize to the team. 
[01:39:00]  And this was...  It wasn't like everyone said, well, he's trying to save his ass.  That's why he's going to apologize.  And it was not...  That was not the case.  He genuinely wanted to apologize.  No, it didn't seem like he was out there trying to save his ass because it hadn't reached  that point of saving ass yet.  We've been in situations before where we were in saving ass mode.  And the company was in saving ass mode.  And they came up with the dumbest stories and ideas and everything. 
[01:39:30]  You know when you're in save your ass mode.  That's when you order the pies.  You order the pies for the mayor to throw them at our face.  The old Boston thing.  That's save your ass mode.  He was, you know, sincere in going out there and trying to reach out.  To the community.  And Reverend Al especially, which he...  That, I think, was one of his biggest mistakes.  But that's in hindsight.  I don't think he should have given him any credibility as far as sitting with him one-to-one  on his territory, Reverend Al's territory, and going back and forth like that. 
[01:40:00]  It was a no-win scenario.  That, I think, hurt.  And it gave Reverend Al this new mission in life and this credibility to point out humor  as this racist device that people are using.  It's getting ridiculous.  And now it's coming home to roost.  As they say.  Because who just got in trouble?  Eddie Griffin.  Oh, yeah.  Eddie Griffin.  Who supported Imus, one of the only comedians.  D.L. Hughley did, too.  Yeah.  D.L. supported Imus. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, D.L.  Right, right.  Black entertainers didn't support him at all.  Wait, yeah.  I just got them too confused.  Oh, well, that'll happen.  Jesus Christ.  Would you stop it?  Obviously a joke.  And then you have to say obviously a joke to hopefully save your ass.  That's what radios come down to.  Ran away from Imus.  All these pussy friends.  All these fair-weathered sissies.  Don't get me started.  Who was the most surprising to you?  Because you knew these guys.  Besides the fact that Al Roker waited until he was 50 years old to try to be poignant once 
[01:41:00]  in his disgusting, failed weatherman life.  Your job is to wear suits and report rain.  Who was the biggest shock to you?  Tim Russert.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a biggie.  You know, he just really showed his true colors.  Just a two-faced weasel.  Yeah, that was a big one, man.  Because he was on the show all the time.  David Gregory.  David Gregory.  That guy's a loser.  That guy played along with every bit Imus ever did.  Imus is broadcasting the Radiothon, raising money for sick kids. 
[01:41:30]  Unbelievable.  Down the hall.  From a studio.  And they wouldn't even put him on MSNBC.  Down the hall, David Gregory is doing a show, tearing him apart.  Tearing him apart.  You just shake your head.  And again, this wasn't some Radiothon that had come up like, we better do this to get  out of trouble.  This is something he's done for years.  It was like the 15th annual or whatever it was.  That show raised so much money for these kids and just gets the shaft. 
[01:42:00]  And that shows MSNBC's true colors because you couldn't wait a day.  The guy was actually raising money for sick kids.  Let them be.  I don't think anyone would have faulted MSNBC if they waited an extra day.  And David Gregory was on Imus' show all the time doing his Tom Brokaw impression.  He guest hosted the show for Imus when I was with a jury.  I don't know who he is.  He's an NBC correspondent.  He's on Today's show a lot, you know.  Okay.  Black guy, white guy?  White guy.  He's kind of a Richie Cunningham look.  Kind of a sandy colored. 
[01:42:30]  You kind of want to tossle his car.  So he's kind of like a Keith Olbermann in the sense that he was going to use this to  show black people that he was one of the good white folks, which is what Olbermann  did by groveling to Jesse Jackson.  Like, I'm one of the good white people.  Please approve of me.  Hey, by the way, I went back to my bosses and I said, this shouldn't go, they should  fire this guy.  Yeah.  Have you talked to Imus at all?  Yeah, we have.  I mean, how is he, is he in a rage or is he sad or everything?  I think he's waiting for the opportunity to get back on the air and... 
[01:43:00]  And that will happen, by the way.  And tell his side of the story and, you know...  That's going to be a great day.  There's David Gregory there.  All these guys...  I've seen him.  Oh, yeah.  Freep.  Sick.  I've said it on the air when we...  It's like Tony Snow without the cancer.  I hate him.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  Where else do you get this kind of radio, folks?  I've said it on the air.  When we were off the air for that two and a half years or whatever it turned out to be,  the only radio show I would really listen to was Imus. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  And mostly the MSNBC portion, because you could watch it, which is kind of a cool thing, obviously.  And when I saw, like, David Gregory and Tim Russert and the rest of them just  turning their back so, so dramatically.  I'm like, what the hell is wrong with you people?  There's no loyalty.  They were obviously friends.  I mean, these guys were on his show so much that they had to be friends off air to a point.  They used him every time they wanted to promote a book.  Yeah, that's what it was.  We've reached this point where there's this thing, this floating cloud that you can't hurt anyone's feelings, 
[01:44:00]  even with comedy.  It doesn't matter.  There are words now that we use initials for, that grown men are in front of other grown men  using the, saying the N word, as if, first of all, no one knows what it is,  because when you say it, I'm sorry, the word pops in my head. 
[01:44:30]  And I'm hearing it in my mental auditory system right now.  But we actually, as adults, say the N word.  And the F word used to be, you know, the fun word where you get into bed and you F.  But now it's the other F word, which, you know, Jerry Lewis used the other day on his telethon.  And Ann Coulter used for John Edwards.  Right.  Yep. 
[01:45:00]  And that's another one you can't use, is grown people.  Using initials.  Using initials.  You can't say Freemason anymore?  No.  See?  Now that was dumped out of Freemason.  When did you realize, because you were there for the whole thing,  when did you realize, like, all right, this is not just annoying, this is a major problem?  I don't know at what point.  That whole week is kind of like, kind of all fuzzy at the moment.  It was just one of those things where you just kept thinking it was going to be over, 
[01:45:30]  it was going to be over, it was going to be over.  And then the next day, it wasn't.  And it was that much worse.  It's the same.  It snowballed.  It snowballed.  Panicking every night, would you watch TV and just like, oh my God.  It was, I mean, part of the problem was it was a slow news week, you know?  Oh, God.  It was a slow news week.  This is so, you're freaking us out, because we've heard that so many times.  Don't mess up on a slow news week.  They always tell you that.  Yeah.  If they had just announced, you know, Anna Nicole's baby's father's true identity, you know. 
[01:46:00]  Which, by the way, is Rita Cosby.  I don't know if you know that.  Yes.  Two weeks later.  Rita Cosby.  Rita Cosby.  Attila.  Larry Birkenhead.  Larry Birkenhead.  And then, our case started with Taylor.  And we got proved that we could be.  I love that.  I like it when the actor plays out and does it in practice.  Yeah.  See?  He is the actor.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I only got a couple I could actually do, but.  There were so many situations where you sit there and go, I think we're going to be all 
[01:46:30]  right.  You're on the phone with each other.  Yeah.  All right.  It's kind of dying down.  I think we'll be all right.  And then, like, five minutes later, you get another phone call and go, oh, we're so fired.  Oh, no.  We are so definitely fired.  This is not happening.  Dude, did you check Google?  Oh, no.  No.  All right.  CNN just picked it up.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  And they're sending a crew.  And then, it's just the worst feeling.  And then, for weeks and months afterwards, it was just like, every two seconds, you know,  you'd see the picture.  It still doesn't stop, too.  Like, any time with this Eddie Griffin thing that happened, they mentioned the Imus situation. 
[01:47:00]  Were you surprised?  Like, what annoyed me so much is the way black performers, like artists who need free speech,  rappers, they came out against him.  It's like, you phony idiots.  Do you really think, like, that the freedom of speech issue is only going to be him?  It's like, it's going to hit everybody as entertainers.  It just, it was a perfect storm, you know?  It was just all the stuff together combined to, you know, you can analyze this for years 
[01:47:30]  and years and years, and I don't think you're ever going to be able to figure out exactly  at what point it hit critical mass, because I, what's frustrating is that after it was  all over, they took the one man off the air who could have really done something to  do some good out of what had happened.  Right.  To actually rob Barlin.  Well, Barlin, who does Brian Wilson, President Clinton, and everybody else on that show. 
[01:48:00]  That was stupid.  But he could have gone a long way towards really mending a lot of those fences by being  on the air and bringing people on the show to talk about it and discuss it.  But no, they took him off the air, so any chance of there being something of value coming  out of it was totally destroyed.  Yeah, they blew it.  Whoever now blew it, he should have said, look, I don't want him fired, and there would  have been some discussions.  And what about that?  The whole buckling under to somebody like Reverend Al and his group and just the companies having 
[01:48:30]  no backbone, not waiting it out to see what really happens.  There's these threats of boycotts and these threats of marches.  Let's see what happens.  See how many sponsors actually pull out.  If a couple pull out, that's one thing.  I don't see it as the company should just, let's clean house, get them out.  Oh my God, everything's collapsing.  They are so quick to pull the trigger when things like this happen. 
[01:49:00]  It astounds me.  And giving credence to Reverend Al Sharpton, white interlopers.  Remember that line?  But at least Sharpton does what he does, which is the same thing every time.  And he's disgusting.  Guys like Russert and other guys that should have stood up and pushed back, those are the  ones I'd like to bite their faces.  Because Sharpton's garbage.  Everybody knows the guy's a racist, that he's a pig. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, that's what he is.  Self-serving.  He's disgusting.  But I expect that from them.  I didn't expect it from guys that were friends and would come on a show.  You expect them to stand up and go, no, the guy's not a racist.  He's just a tasteless line.  I mean, go with the guy made a mistake or something.  But to completely turn your back like that, my God.  And a mistake.  But no surprise, that's what radio's all about.  There's no loyalty in this business.  And it was one of those, what we call a throwaway line.  You just kind of blurt something out.  You don't even give it a second thought. 
[01:50:00]  And it's not meant with this, like it's built up to be something that it's really not.  When you're doing this, it's a conversation.  You're having fun with your friends.  You're laughing.  You're joking around.  And the intent that other people put on those words, that it's hate speech and this calculated racism.  Dude, it's a throwaway.  It's just like you're BSing with your friends, taken out of context, and you're screwed. 
[01:50:30]  Speaking of that, so the show goes down.  He says what he said, right?  After the show, did you guys have any idea that that show was different?  You know what I mean?  You know, I don't recall it.  Like when we took the phone call from St. Pat's.  I don't recall.  It was a long time ago.  But I'm just saying, when we took the phone call from Paul Mercurio at St. Pat's and that went on the air.  Right.  Ant and I immediately looked at each other and went, this is going to be bad.  It's going to be a problem.  We don't know if we're going to get fired, but we know this is going to be a problem. 
[01:51:00]  Like after that show, did you guys even think that what was said could be a problem?  Because there was no intent.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  So you went home thinking, all right, we just did another fine show.  When it became clear that it was a problem, immediately there was, you know, remorse and, you know, retribution and apologies and trying to make good on it.  And the firing.  After the whole thing.  Yeah.  How's Bernard?  I heard he was trying to get a gig in Boston.  And just, it was like, yeah, a guest. 
[01:51:30]  He wanted to sit in and, and I don't know, even know if it was technically, was it a tryout that he was doing?  I don't know.  I don't know if it was a tryout or not, but I mean, he was just going to be a couple of days a week.  I guess he was going to be a guest and, and they put the kibosh on there.  And they chased his ass out of there.  I mean, how funny is Bernard?  How funny is Bernard?  Bernard is hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, it's, he took this, this well-oiled machine.  Right.  Yeah.  And just, you know, disassembled the parts.  We've been there.  We've been there.  We've been there.  Are you optimistic?  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Hope springs eternal, Jimmy.  Yes.  I got that out of my tender sentiment.  Oh, you optimistic.  Well, I mean, like, you know, he settled already.  He settled pretty quick.  Usually, this show sat for 26 months.  Well, they know Imus doesn't have that much time.  He can sit for two years.  Jesus.  They had another thing.  On the air.  They had another thing that they were taking care of with us.  They wanted to keep us away from Howard for two and a half years. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, of course.  It's a known fact now.  20-something million dollars worth, or whatever they paid him.  They paid him millions, and now he can work again.  I mean, his lawyer did a good job.  He's Lenny Bruce's lawyer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Rob Bartlett in studio.  Bruce's lawyer's still alive.  That's my first thought.  Five shots, and he's still alive.  Jesus.  This Saturday the 15th, Rob's a great comic.  He's got Ben Franklin as his lawyer.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Talking over his plug.  Comedy Connection, Kowloon, Saugus Mass, which I've done. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, that's Bill Blumenreich's place.  It is.  It's one of the...  You know, it's a very, very good room.  Very good room.  Oh, you do, Bill.  About 10 people are laughing out there.  Have you tried the Chinese food?  It's quite good.  617-248-9700.  Saugus Mass, Comedy Connection, September 15th.  September 15th.  And then October 6th at Centennial Hall, St. John's University, Oakdale.  Where's that?  Long Island.  Oh, okay.  Out there on Long Island, South Shore. 
[01:53:30]  But this Saturday, is this the 15th?  No, no, it's next Saturday.  I'm next Saturday.  Get a calendar.  Jesus.  I get scared.  We'll be in Philly doing our gig the night we're in Philly.  Camden, Rob will be in Boston.  That's Saugus.  Comedy Connection in Saugus.  All right.  More with Rob Bartlett.  We'll come back as I am.  It's just to make you cry or something.  Okay.  All right.  We'll have Ann come back as I am.  It's for you.  All right.  It's Rob Bartlett.  Be good.  Opie and Anthony.  Uh, 8.40. 
[01:54:00]  Back with the Imus in the Morning program.  Womp womp.  Later on, we'll have Al Gore on.  Stupid idiot.  What a jerk.  And then, uh, that fat cow, Rosie O'Donnell.  Yeah, what a f*** she is. 
[01:54:30]  And then I'll be talking to some f***s.  Yeah, damn.  I love your Imus.  Rob Bartlett in studio.  I'll be in Anthony.  Was that creepy?  That was kind of creepy.  I used to listen to, growing up, to Imus.  I mean, forget about it.  We all did.  Of course.  He was a staple.  I remember. 
[01:55:00]  You listened to Imus.  I had an AM clock radio that I used to use to wake up to go to high school.  And I remember one morning, he did play.  Moby Worm coming together.  Moby Worm was going to eat my school.  He played Elton John's Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.  And he comes back out of the song and goes,  Moby Worm, I'm not going to let you sing it on me.  How about your daughter?  Wah, wah.  And then just, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, in the 70s, that was huge.  Yeah.  That was shocking.  I was out there.  He was a shock jock. 
[01:55:30]  Well, Moby Worm was shocking.  Moby Worm.  How's your donkey called?  No.  Baby.  Oh, you beat your spuzzy baby.  Well, he's been booted a couple of times, didn't he?  Yeah, he got fired from, I guess it was Palmdale first, and then Cleveland, and then here, and  then back to Cleveland, and then back to here.  It's so unusual for radio to have to change jobs so often.  Yeah, to leave, to be thrown out of a state. 
[01:56:00]  It's just amazing that when you get fired from your job doing anything else, you could  usually stay in the state.  You have to leave the state.  Right.  It's dumb.  You get fired from air conditioning or something.  Right.  Pretty much you get an air conditioning job in the same town.  In the same town.  By the radio, you mess up.  It's like, sorry.  Sorry, you have to now leave the state.  Back up, leave the state.  I had Mark Cronin, who still works at WCMF in Rochester, when I was first getting into  the business, he goes, Ope, you're not officially in radio until you got fired. 
[01:56:30]  Until you get fired.  Yeah.  And not once anymore.  Not once, right.  You're not officially in until you're not quite sure if you're blackballed or not.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much it now.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if I can work in this business anymore.  Hey, I'm in radio.  My name isn't mud by now.  I'm a failure.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Oh, you can't be blackballed on radio.  You just can't be, because there's always going to be a place that needs somebody to  get numbers.  I hope so.  You know? 
[01:57:00]  So, keep telling yourself that.  What happened to Eddie Griffin?  He was apparently dropping the N-bomb at some, it was probably the type of gig that he shouldn't  have been hired for, because it seemed like an older black crowd.  Eddie's like a pretty raunchy act, and even if it wasn't for that, I heard it was over,  I'm trying to find the story.  Oh, thanks, Rudy.  Um, he, uh, uh, he stopped and repeatedly used the N-word.  It was, uh, for a magazine.  It was, uh, where is the magazine?  Was it one of these, like, industry? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, it was like one of these industry get-togethers, you get the comedian.  Where's the magazine in this?  Oh, it was here.  It was Black Enterprise Magazine.  It was a VFW dinner.  The Tuskegee Airmen.  He was entertaining them.  Maybe they chose the wrong comedian.  It said he was performing at a Black Enterprise Magazine event in Miami, a suburb of Doral,  blah, blah, blah.  And he was cut off for using profanities, and the N-word, uh, what happened was the president  of, of, uh, the magazine went up and actually cut his microphone off. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  He said, we will not, uh, set our culture backwards.  And they gave him a standing ovation.  The guy.  Oh, the guy.  But it was probably an older crowd, not right for him anyway.  Yeah.  It's probably like, uh, any white comic doing, say, a Kiwanis Club or some other type of,  like, from you.  Now, you think if Pryor would have gotten thrown off that stage?  No.  You think if Richard Pryor got up there, he'd have been-  Well, Pryor was known, again, Pryor, bad example, because he was known-  No, I mean now, like, the dead body just sitting there.  I think it would have been- 
[01:58:30]  He, uh, Pryor's stuff was so poignant, and it was different, man.  There was a beauty to that.  There was no- It was different.  And Mooney swore off the end road two weeks ago, which who cares?  Like, Pryor swore it off in 81.  He didn't want to say it after he went to Africa and had, like, a real epiphany, and  it was real.  Oh, really?  I didn't know Richard Pryor did that.  Oh, yeah.  He publicly said, I'll never call another black man that again, because he said he was in  Africa, and he had, uh, this weird moment of realizing that he hadn't even thought  it since he was there.  But this is after his burn.  It was a real moment. 
[01:59:00]  He stopped doing Mudbone, too.  Did he really?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Stopped doing Mudbone.  One concert just at the last appearance of Mudbone.  Oh, yeah.  That was probably 83 for Here and Now, which he did in New Orleans.  But yeah, he was- But for Pryor, it was a real thing, and then he unfortunately got  sick and whatever.  He didn't perform much, you know, in the 90s.  But Mooney swore it off after Michael Richards.  It was like, come on, Paul.  And Reverend Now was saying that that was a Michael Richards moment.  What was?  Eddie Griffin up there on stage.  Yeah.  Michael Richards was using anger to attack a guy personally. 
[01:59:30]  Eddie Griffin's a comedian, and comedians are supposed to say what you're not allowed  to say.  Yeah.  That's part of a comic's job, is to kind of challenge what society is telling you is  right.  I mean, blah, blah.  Boring everybody.  But that's what it is.  You don't just go with the status quo.  Yeah.  Letty Bruce attack the church.  That's what you're supposed to do.  No one attacked the church.  I think the biggest crime here is that he probably shouldn't have been booked for that  show.  Yes.  But then Reverend Now jumped on it, and he had a comment that this is a great win for 
[02:00:00]  his side.  There's a question somewhere, Jimmy.  And which makes me say, you know, see?  Everyone was cheering Reverend Now for what he did to Imus.  And now, no one's safe.  Well, I don't know if Eddie was.  Again, I don't know what his take was.  But after what Snoop's take was, which was like, it's different when we said, yeah?  Well, now, this is what they're doing, is they're going after DJs.  They're encouraging DJs to be boycotted who play the music of artists that use the word. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  See, they're going to get the rappers now, and the way they do it is by going after Viacom  and say, we'll attack every advertiser in your chain if you play any artist that uses  the word on his mouth.  So it's going to become so diluted now if you're using the word.  Master P has said he's not going to use it.  And he said it's because he saw-  Master Poe is not going to use it?  Unbelievable.  And he didn't even know it was a bad word.  I thought it meant stingy. 
[02:01:00]  Rob Bartlett, when did you have time to listen to our show while you're doing your own morning  show?  What I am is-  I am well-schooled in the O&A.  No, just love it.  Vernacular.  Here's Reverend Al's statement.  He expressed gratitude that the nation's preeminent magazine for African Americans stands behind  the efforts of the National Action Network in getting rid of the N-word.  National Action Network.  Exactly.  And he calls it the N-word.  You can't start getting rid of words in America.  It really is ridiculous.  You really can't.  They've just kind of got to go away. 
[02:01:30]  And it's, yeah.  You know, some words go away.  Fedora.  You don't hear that one much anymore.  That's the F-word.  That's the new F-word.  I'm sorry.  I want to apologize to fedora-wearing Americans.  If you see somebody with one, you go, what are you, a fedora lover?  Yes, exactly.  Did your father see you with that fedora on your head?  He'd turn over in his grave.  Don't you bring a fedora into this house.  Exactly.  It makes the other hats worse.  Dungarees. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, I got to put on my dungarees.  Lucky Brand still uses dungarees.  I don't care.  Words go away.  They're trying to keep dungarees alive.  Yeah.  Typhus.  There you go.  I don't know.  There you go.  Typhus.  Hullabaloo.  There you go.  No one uses that.  Hurdy-gurdy.  The hurdy-gurdy.  Honky.  Well, honky never bothered anybody. 
[02:02:30]  I would prefer if you used the H word.  Yes, the H word.  The H word.  Honky.  But you can't really get rid of them.  The more you try, I don't know.  The more fun they are to say it.  The more fun they are to whisper to a prostitute when you're behind her.  Or scream out in a crowded subway.  Exactly.  But then if you yell at the subway, just make sure you're on the A train or the 150th Street.  But then look around and smile and go, right?  Right?  Right.  Nobody will bother you.  Come on, people.  Of course.  Come on.  Yes.  Yes.  Come on. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, Rob.  Since being off the air, what's the one thing you like?  Like, was there a story that hit where you went, oh, my God, I wish we were doing our  show?  Oh, I mean, it's just one after another.  I mean, it's...  Anything recently?  There was the senator and...  Larry Craig.  We're having a lot of fun with Larry Craig.  Oh, my God.  Who knew you'd need a wide stance in the stall?  You know...  That makes me laugh every day.  I guess you're dropping those real big logs, Larry.  I mean, just...  What is the deal with...  I mean, it's just...  There's been a lot, man.  There's been a...  I didn't know there was a code. 
[02:03:30]  Like, there was an actual tap the foot...  Tap, tap, touch the foot...  You need the memo?  All right.  I knew the...  I'm just trying to...  Oh, okay.  He's just trying to cover off...  One tap for...  One tap for top.  Two taps for...  Oh, shit.  Oh.  There it is.  Oh, I got to watch him do it.  Oh, that's so exciting.  I didn't like to make Will Wolf movies.  I'm glad Alex Baldwin isn't commenting because...  Oh, that would be terrible.  I flubbed.  Wow.  I've never done radio. 
[02:04:00]  Rob was my buddy, and I got nervous.  Oh, you suck.  I don't know why with my timing because I'm not even close to having that thing ready.  Oh, I got one for him.  Right center field.  McClouth is back to the track.  He leaps at the wall, and it is gone.  It just cleared.  Yeah, Jimmy.  No.  What are they saying now?  They're saying two.  They're saying it's a double.  It went just under the wall.  Oh, Jimmy, it went under the wall.  I wanted to say one tap for top.  Yeah.  Two taps for bottom, but I couldn't say it. 
[02:04:30]  I've made an ass of myself.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'm telling you something.  How does that not go in?  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  That Alec Baldwin, I've never heard anyone say anything more perfectly and succinctly.  He really did a good job.  I've made an ass.  Like, what a great way to say ass.  He's acting on the phone. 
[02:05:00]  He's wonderful.  Yeah.  That bad child he raised.  Disgusting pig.  Such a term of endearment for a young girl.  Wonderful.  Oh, you weren't on the air for that either, huh?  I know.  I mean, it was just so much stuff that we missed.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah.  What the hell are you going to do?  Good time.  But you're keeping busy.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, I'm still doing stand-up.  Still doing Chicago.  Still doing...  I thought that was done.  No, I'm there until January, at least.  Oh, are you any time... 
[02:05:30]  Like, since you know he's settled, which is a great sign that that's done already.  They're not making him sit for five years.  Are you kind of like, all right, let me enjoy sleep until whenever we're back on, because  you get to sleep a little later.  You know, sleep is underrated.  Yeah.  He wants to work.  No, no, I know that, but you understand.  Sleep's underrated.  Already you're starting to see that things are working.  Unless you don't get it.  You guys will be back sooner than later.  I'm not, you know, I'm hopeful.  I actually hope they don't, because I don't feel like looking at that across the street 
[02:06:00]  and competing with it, because that's basically...  It's not like I'm just going to come back and do afternoons.  No.  You know?  Maybe that'd be great if K-Rod...  I'm just in the afternoon.  Doesn't roll off the tongue.  No.  No.  We always get along, though.  I mean, it's like...  Oh, he loves you guys.  And our audiences are a little different.  And you guys really, you know, stood up for him big time, you know, when I went down  and meant a lot to him, and he actually said...  Probably said, thank them all.  I sent him an email or something.  He did say thank you, actually.  Oh, he did? 
[02:06:30]  It was on Drudge that he was thanking the Opie and Anthony show.  In a general rule.  My name wasn't mentioned specifically.  But I'm saying he did.  He doesn't like you.  I know he doesn't.  I don't know why.  I love him.  I told him that you weren't a good person.  I was able to talk to him when it all went down, before his phone went out.  I got like 20 seconds with him.  He goes, I guess I finally have to adopt you officially.  Yeah.  Oh, the fun with that picture.  That is the greatest picture.  It's like you went to Madame Tussauds.  Yeah.  It's really...  Yeah, it's the picture that he showed on MSNBC.  I met him at a book signing, and he's convinced that he banged my mom in the early 70s after 
[02:07:00]  an Islanders game.  I don't remember her.  I was back in like 72, I think.  Yeah.  Bernard called him.  He said, I must look like Camilla Parker Bowles.  I'm like, Jesus, Dad, what a great thing to say to a man.  How funny is that?  All right, listen.  We're going to leave this side of the show because we want to get another play of Roland  singing Pavarotti in honor of Pavarotti's death today.  Hey, Rob, you're going to join us on the other side? 
[02:07:30]  I would love to do the walkover and be over there.  I would love to say all kinds of stuff.  We're not walking.  We stay here, but we make believe we walk.  Oh, okay.  They're still working on our other studio.  We have two studios.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Well, we don't.  We have one and one that isn't quite done.  Sorry.  So that's what you meant about the new studio looks exactly like this one.  Exactly.  Look at it.  It's beautiful.  Doppelganger.  Rob, because we've got a lot of people listening on BCN, he's going to be at the Comedy Connection  in Saugus, Mass, September 15th, a week from Saturday.  Rob Bartlett.  And on St. John's October 6th in Long Island. 
[02:08:00]  That's right.  Both shows will sell out, so don't grovel.  Just get the tickets.  Right.  And be there.  Well, in honor of Pavarotti dying, 71, pancreatic cancer.  He had a good run, though.  Roland came in and sang a Pavarotti classic.  Yeah.  And you tell me if you can tell them apart.  Yeah.  It brought tears to our eyes.  You know, it's unusual that a Mexican would be able to sing Pavarotti so well.  Stop with the references to our show, you creep. 
[02:08:30]  I love it.  You're like a stalker.  You've got to think about Pavarotti.  You know, you're a fat guy with a beard.  Yeah.  You have two career options.  You know, sing opera, cook Cajun.  That was a good thing.  How are your prawns?  All right.  Here's Roland from earlier this morning.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  Or maybe not.  Oh, Opie, what happened?  The clip's not playing.  Well, usually you need to put the...  Oh, the CD.  Oh, the disco isn't even in there.  No, this isn't.  Look at what's...  It's regular 101.  Look what's still on the air. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  This is crap.  All right.  Here we go.  Roland.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you, Rob Bartlett.  Shut your eyes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Love it.  Love it.  Oh, Maria, gratia plinia. 
[02:09:30]  Maria, gratia plinia.  Oh, Maria, gratia plinia.  Ave, ave, dominus.  Dominus, tecum benita, to inmo-barsia, et to benedicia, et to frac-chus-ventris-ventris-ventris-de-Jesus. 
[02:10:00]  Ave, Maria, gratia plinia.  Yeah.  Ave, Maria, matade, ora por nobis, pretropius. 
[02:10:30]  Ora por nobis, ora, ora pro nobis, pretropius.  Ave, Maria.  Nuct, et in ho-r-ma-trus, et in ho-r-ma-trus-natoris.  Ave, Maria.  Ave, Maria. 
[02:11:00]  Ave Maria.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Wow.  You think he'll get an 11-minute standing ovation? 
[02:11:30]  Bravo.  Bravo.  He's single.  Bravo.  El Faxo.  El Faxo.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  I got to tell you, man.  This doing two radio shows really sucks. 
[02:12:00]  Two fucking radio shows every day.  Every single day.  Two radio shows.  Not one, but two.  At least you have a radio show.  That is cruel.  Oh, my God.  That's cruel.  Two of these shows every day.  The hell that is your life.  One thing, though.  Sorry, Rob.  When you're sitting on the edge of that bed at four in the morning. 
[02:12:30]  I know.  I forgot.  You kind of.  Yeah.  You're like, well, geez.  A little vacation.  Oh, yeah.  Now I remember why I hated this.  Yeah, that's a little getting up early, crap.  By the way, Rob Bartlett from I'm just a show in studio.  We don't really take.  These are the suckiest blowy things.  The blowy things suck.  What?  Can I tell you?  My girlfriend wanted to sleep till 1040 this morning.  Yeah.  All right.  Can I set the alarm?  You know, while I leave at 5 fucking 35.  Can you set the alarm for 1040?  Just got a fucking text. 
[02:13:00]  8.58 in the morning it came.  I'm eating a Tofutti cutie right now.  The cleaning lady put away the dirty dishes.  Ha.  So, because you had your cleaning people come over.  Nice and early.  Nice and early.  Yeah, because his girlfriend wants to sleep.  She wants to sleep in.  Sleep in, Tof.  But Jimmy wants his apartment clean, and he doesn't want the cleaning to happen when he  goes home and sleeps.  Oh.  When the man, when the breadwinner goes home.  Yeah.  Who's paying the rent?  That's a good point.  Who's paying the rent, Jimmy? 
[02:13:30]  Let me just answer that question.  I am.  That's my point.  Hey, Rob, by the way, we don't take the XM side too seriously, so if you want a bowl  of cereal or anything.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we just eat on the air.  This is.  And just kind of watch the clock.  This is where we phone it in.  Mm-hmm.  You just run it out, basically?  Yeah, pretty much.  Just run the clock out.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the end of the football game where they just kind of like-  Take a knee.  Take a knee.  Yeah, that's what the XM portion of the show is.  It's the take a knee.  It's the radio take a knee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, do you still do the Beatles in your act? 
[02:14:00]  That's my standard.  It's my favorite part of my act.  Still do.  Rob does the, I don't want to give it away, but it's just a very funny thing about the Beatles.  I do all four of the Beatles, but when I first, I tell a story that when my, the moment I knew  I was going to go into show business when I was a kid, I would imitate all four of the  Beatles.  I'd put, you know, whatever Beatle record on to my close and play record player, and I  would act out all four of the Beatles, and I'd close out the show with an original Beatles  song that I wrote and sent to them, and they never used, and I was very offended. 
[02:14:30]  But I act out all four of the Beatles.  It's my favorite part of my act.  Yeah, because I remember, it was, it was, you don't, you don't sing, or do you do sing,  you're almost.  On the track, I sing on the track, but I mean, I lip sync it for the thing.  He's lip syncing.  I get too winded.  And did you always do it with, did you ever do it with an original Beatles song?  I used to do it with She Loves You, but then I couldn't do it on a TV or anything because  you couldn't get the, you couldn't get the rights to it.  What could the rights cost?  But he does, he acts out all the Beatles play, and it's, it really is funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember, my dad and I went to see Rob many, many years ago at Rascals. 
[02:15:00]  It's nice to know that I helped a bonding between Jimmy and his father.  You didn't, we fought all the way home.  You told me my mother enjoyed black men.  I was like, Dad.  I know.  I supply them.  Oh, I forgot to turn audio on on Pal Talk.  Boy, they get mad.  Fuck Pal Talk.  They get angry.  Rob wants, I'm not fat, you fuck.  Who said you're fat?  You look delicious.  I mean, what?  Big white frunkus.  No.  Opie looks fat on Opie, too, Cam. 
[02:15:30]  Fucking fans are crazy.  They're nuts, aren't they?  They're just...  And we have to fight them all day.  We're trying to do a radio show, and we're in the middle of fist fights all day long.  Oh, it's the baddest, strangest fans in the business, you guys.  You don't know if they love us or hate us half the time.  What the fuck?  We're trying to do a show and make people laugh, and you're just punching and fighting  fans off the whole time.  So-called fans.  So speaking of being a fan, Rob, you want to say how to whack bad, because you're a member.  I am box of wine. 
[02:16:00]  You're a box of wine.  You've said some really shitty things about me over the years.  No, no, no.  I wasn't that.  How funny would it be if I go and I see all the box of wine posts, is I like it a lot  better when Bob Kelly's in.  I think I spell it B-A-U-X, though, to get the box of wine.  Box of wine.  Box of wine.  Brian from St. Louis.  Opie, since you guys are doing your, quote, phone it in gag, I'm doing the, quote, pissed  listener gag.  And then he writes, do something funny, you bastards. 
[02:16:30]  And then he writes, I was only joking.  Sounds good so far.  Okay.  Fuck you.  There you go.  Oh, that feels good.  Give him a fond.  Isn't it odd to curse in a microphone like that?  It's so strange.  When people do radio and then they come here, it's very odd for them to first throw the first  F-bomb out.  Is that your first curse on a radio?  That was my first curse on a radio show?  How cool is that?  Yeah.  And you guys got to be the ones.  What were you, I walked in, because I had to get cereal, because I'm ready to pass out.  Sure.  And I walked into some kind of LBJ, really interesting story about him in pajamas and hunting. 
[02:17:00]  I don't know what the hell was going on.  I'll set it up just before Rob tells it.  I was, Rob is a performing in Chicago here in New York City.  And my girlfriend and I were going to go see him, but.  Wait a minute.  Chicago's not in New York City, though.  It is.  Chicago's in.  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean the play.  Opie.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's musical.  Oh.  And we were going to go see him, but I thought he was done.  And he goes, no, I re-upped.  And he was saying that Kelly Osbourne may be joining the cast in December.  And George Hamilton is joining the cast. 
[02:17:30]  Next week.  So I say, I'd like to get a picture with him.  And Rob said, George is a cunt.  So I said, Rob.  He did.  Rob said that.  I was here.  He didn't say that, Jimmy.  He said that George is a great guy, and he just tells stories, and he started talking  about George Hamilton.  He tells the greatest stories.  He used to date Linda Bird Johnson.  And who is LBJ's daughter.  LBJ's daughter.  I thought it was his wife.  Oh, my God.  I was like, what?  That's what I thought, too.  Oh, yeah.  That ladybird got around.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Her and Nipsey Russell, big. 
[02:18:00]  Big controversy.  So George used to date Linda Bird Johnson.  And so he's at some premiere or something in Hollywood, and he's in his tux.  And he gets a phone call.  There's going to be a couple of naval officers with a car out front.  But, you know, the president wants to see you.  And, you know, at the time, there was a lot of controversy going around because he had  not, you know, he was dating the president's daughter, and he had not yet been drafted,  and he was of draftable age.  It was the heart of the Vietnam War.  Oh, I thought the controversy was that, you know, LBJ killed President Kennedy. 
[02:18:30]  See, you weren't supposed to tell that part of the story.  So, of course, George starts getting the douche chills.  He's, you know, what's going to happen?  He gets in the car, and they take him to the airport, and they fly him to the East Coast,  and it lands in Virginia, and there's a convertible on the tarmac, and in the convertible, and it's  like four o'clock in the morning, in the convertible, in his pajamas, his LBJ.  And his PJ.  With two shotguns.  What year was this?  This was 60-something. 
[02:19:00]  Probably 67, 68.  And LBJ says, come on, we're going hunting.  So, George Hamilton in a tuxedo and LBJ in his pajamas go deer hunting in the Virginia  woods.  Fucking four o'clock.  How fucking great.  Out of the back of a fucking, you know, convertible.  But how do you, like, if you're hanging out with George Hamilton, what story do you tell  after he tells that one?  There's no story you can tell.  What do you do?  He always does something that'll top that.  You know what I mean?  Because he's been famous for 40 years, and he's like, a guy like that, what do you say 
[02:19:30]  after that?  I would absolutely think that I was being killed, like LBJ was going to shoot me during this  hunting trip, and then like if they-  Jumped the body in the woods.  Yeah, back then, if they couldn't make people disappear, that was the day and age of making  people just go away.  Absolutely.  And I don't know if I'd have gotten in that car.  I'd have ran away.  Well, was he dating her?  How long did he date her for?  I don't know.  How cool is that, though, to know that you're deep-dicking the daughter of, at the time, 
[02:20:00]  the most powerful man on earth.  The man that could have, who was, you know, he was in charge.  You have a very interesting perspective on life, Jimmy.  That's the way I look at it.  Yeah, and we really need to-  A savage deep-dicking.  Del.  Especially if he was really anti-war, and he would fucking hold the back of her hair  and push her face into the pillow, and put a pillbox hat on her, and then just give her  a-  Here's my kid offensive!  A nice, solid, an anal, and a fucking- 
[02:20:30]  Oh, wow.  A fucking gaping anal deep-dicking.  What's better for a president's daughter?  I submit nothing.  We call it Me-Lie Sex.  Me-Lie.  Coke Logic wants us to play something for you there, Rob.  All righty.  Rob Bartlett from Imus' show.  Oh.  Oh, is this the idea?  Say, y'all!  Shaw Kingston!  You're way too beautiful, girl.  That's why it'll never work.  You have me- 
[02:21:00]  Suicidal.  You make me suicidal.  Cause you say it's over to fuck my oldies, beautiful girls.  They only wanna do you dirt.  They don't have you-  Suicidal.  You make me suicidal.  Cause you say it's over to fuck my oldies, beautiful girls.  Smartass.  Um, why were we on the news? 
[02:21:30]  What happened?  Stephen S. from, uh, is this Stephen S. from Bayshore?  He goes, uh, you were just on the news, but I'm sure you just saw that.  No.  Ha, we didn't do it.  And if you were on the news, it's not because we, you know, came up with a cure for a disease.  No.  Did someone do the clocks wrong?  And we've been cursing on regular radio.  They set the clocks back.  Stephen S.  That would be funny.  You have any, uh, other info about us being on the news?  That's never good.  You, you, you should never-  Uh, Iraq? 
[02:22:00]  Any details?  All right.  It's-  Do you have-  Every time we're on the-  We've never been on the news for a good thing.  It's probably in a story, like, maybe other radio hosts was fired.  Yeah.  When somebody went to an island.  You guys get lumped in a lot of times.  I wouldn't worry about it.  With anybody.  They probably found Bin Laden, and they're like, and other people who have gotten in trouble.  The people who have been naughty.  Yeah, they have used-  It's a stretch how they use this on the news at this point. 
[02:22:30]  It really is just silly.  You've been good boys for a long time.  Iraq?  Uh-oh.  Um, Steve's telling me right now that wasn't him posting.  Uh, so someone's fucking with us, maybe?  Okay.  Uh, do we know?  Does anyone know?  You know.  Well, what a-  What an easy-  We're a very easy radio show to disrupt.  Dude, when it comes to news and us, you know.  By the way, Steve from Bayshore got me my cat, Jack Jack.  I didn't know that!  I just figured I'd throw that out there.  Ooh!  My little cat's Jack Jack.  Oh, nice.  He should've given you a paper's fucking chair. 
[02:23:00]  Aren't they wonderful?  Especially the white meat.  First little paws.  Here, climb up on this, shit dick.  He's got little white mitten paws.  Right into a paper shredder.  You don't want to put your kitten's paws in a paper shredder.  Well, you know what you want to do?  You want to go, oh boy, oh boy, onto one of those paper cutters, and when he puts his  little white things, you fucking, you bring it down, and you cut right with the fucking  That is such a homo pet.  I can't believe you have a cat.  I would have thought you'd have a Rottweiler coming into your book meetings.  Oh, those are, I hate Rottweil's. 
[02:23:30]  I hate the big nasty dogs.  He's a very confusing man.  He really is.  This is the tender, sensitive side.  I have my sensitive side.  Yeah, you don't like kids, you don't like marriage anymore, but he finds kittens adorable.  I never really liked marriage.  I gotta be honest with you.  I know you're ready, you know, to enter the world of matrimony and everything, and it's  a completely different situation.  You're different people, the whole thing.  But me?  Three weeks, by the way.  Like I said, on my wedding night, I'm laying there looking at the ceiling with these tears 
[02:24:00]  slowly coming down the corner of my eyes going, what did I do?  What did I do?  And this was day one.  Day one.  Day one.  There were only nine years to go.  La, la, la, I don't hear you.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, I can't hear you.  It was, I knew that I had made a grave error in judgment.  She was passed out?  Uh.  Sleeping or whatever?  Yeah, it was just, it was, the whole day was just a clusterfuck and things had gone 
[02:24:30]  on.  There was an argument between her and my mother.  Oh, Jesus.  And I was just like, this is day one.  Okay.  Day one.  Nine years later.  It was over.  How did it last nine years?  Because I've always been the just fucking let it ride.  Let it sit.  I'll, you know, uh, maybe it'll get better or maybe it just won't get worse. 
[02:25:00]  That's pretty much been my life.  Hey, as long as it doesn't get worse, I'm okay.  I'll go with the status quo.  So, and then once I got into radio, all bets were off.  It's like, man, okay, life can be pretty sweet.  And then I started realizing I'm in a bad situation here.  Uh, I gotta get a girlfriend.  Hmm.  You know, I'm in a bad situation.  Well, let me get a girlfriend.  Uh, why don't we play this for you?  Oh.  Two girls for every boy. 
[02:25:30]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Hey, wait a minute.  Didn't I write that?  Hey, Brian Wilson is back in studio.  Thank you, Brian, for that little tidbit of music.  Yeah.  I, I bought my engagement ring at Penn Station, too.  Oh, my God.  I'm just going to sit here and lob the references.  Oh, that's great.  Actually, okay.  Yeah.  That would be fun.  Because this guy's an Uber fan.  I don't know how, because he was doing a movie for himself. 
[02:26:00]  It's a replay.  For a while.  Replay, baby.  It's all about the replay.  I listen to two things on XM.  You guys and John Van Susten on the Broadway channel.  All right.  Oh.  Try to throw something.  Things are swell.  Things are great.  La, la, la.  Not for my friend, because broth is the last thing he ate.  Long way to go.  Rob, just throw them in.  Just throw the really obscure ones in.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  He's been good with them.  I won't.  When they, when they, when they come up, I mean, I just can't pull them out of me. 
[02:26:30]  Right, Rob.  Just pull them out of your race.  You know what I'm saying?  Yep.  It's all about timing.  It's all about timing.  I understand that.  Let's, let's say hi to Matt in Cleveland.  Matt, what's up?  Hey there, Matt.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, buddy.  Thank you.  I want to know if Don Imus is going to walk Opie up the aisle.  Give him a hug.  Ah.  I will not invite Don Imus to my wedding.  Why wouldn't you invite him?  Because I know he wouldn't go.  He wouldn't go.  And I don't want to be insulted.  Oh.  You know what?  I would rather just not invite people like that. 
[02:27:00]  He'd be insulted if you invited him.  He might know.  God, you think I'm coming to this?  You're a jerk.  Yeah.  Oh, mama.  Well, if O'Neal did not invite me to his barbecue the other day, he had one for Labor Day because  he thought I wouldn't come.  So he calls fucking Disgrace Bob Kelly a three in the afternoon.  I had nothing to do.  So fucking Bob, who shades his goatee, and he really should be fucking talking to Martin  Sheen in a room.  Oh, that's like putting a Band-Aid on a, on a, yeah, you can say. 
[02:27:30]  Putting a Band-Aid on an open wound.  That was just, where's the car crash?  Come on.  Where's the car crash?  Thank you.  That's right.  I should have honored.  Bob, right now, he's shaved, and he's very Colonel Kersish, and he said to me, that's  what he's doing.  Reference bombs.  Say it again.  Say it different and hope that no one got it.  They got it.  I forgot.  Never mind in here.  They just politely ignored it.  And so fucking Patrice calls him, and Bob, this grandiose idiot, hires a limo to take 
[02:28:00]  him from New York to Patrice's fucking party Monday.  And I'm like, could you cunts have called me?  What fucking, no, Patrice invited every stupid comic but me.  Why didn't he, but you're his pal, too.  Because he's not a good guy.  I would have went.  I'm actually, my feelings are hurt.  You actually knew about it.  I did.  Yeah, see?  Me and Opie didn't even know about it.  Well, you guys really wouldn't have come.  No, I don't.  But I would have.  I don't go to those things. 
[02:28:30]  No, he, I asked him why he didn't invite me to his 4th of July, because I guess he likes  this barbecue thing.  Of course he does.  Well, Opie, they're called cookouts.  They call them cookouts.  And he said the same thing.  He said, you wouldn't have came.  I'm like, I probably would have went.  Why is it the place?  I don't think I did anything this past 4th of July.  Both people he didn't think would come.  I would have actually, I would have went.  Of course I would have went.  You, you, you, Opie would have gone?  I would have went this past week.  Why not?  Well.  Thanks for nothing.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  I'm sure the guest list isn't just me, you, and Jimmy.  There's a lot of people that were there.  What?  I just, I'm just saying, sometimes in party atmospheres like that, people sometimes get  hurt.  Not at Patrice's party.  No?  No.  I don't know, dumb comedians and, you know, friends, Will.  It's nobody that drives in front that's upset that they weren't invited.  No.  Yeah, me.  What kind of friend doesn't, Patrice is literally, and he knows it. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm one of the only people that truly loves him.  Most people tolerate him.  I love him.  I don't even really like him that much.  I just love him because I know him for so long.  He can't even fucking call me and say, come to the party so I can reject him and say,  have you looked at our skin, fuck, skin color differences, but I said, have you seen our  skin?  Stin.  I would love to have gone to his party.  I was hurt, man.  Hey, uh.  Aw.  When you're 10 minutes in, you could have gone, I want to go home.  I want to go home. 
[02:30:00]  See there.  Hey, there it is.  Wow.  I want to go home.  I was drinking grommet, yay, and a box of wine.  I feel privileged that I was part of some of these legendary things.  I was there for the, I want to go home, man.  She was passed out on our friend Jay's shoulder.  Yeah.  Not fun.  Not fun.  We were actually having fun with our personal lives and old mother-in-law ruined it. 
[02:30:30]  Your old mother-in-law.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  We were getting our drink on that night and it was like, what, 1030?  And she was like, I want to go home.  So I had to drive.  I want to go home.  Why did you say no?  Because I, again, I.  Anthony has, here's Anthony's issues.  Hi.  ACOA, which is adult child of alcoholic, because your dad was an alcoholic.  Adult child of alcoholic.  Tremendous issues.  There's like an acronym for that?  Oh, yeah, ACOA.  Absolutely. 
[02:31:00]  Why do they have issues?  Because they just, it's about being afraid of rocking the boat and tolerating what you shouldn't  in Al-Anon stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  But what about my mommy?  Maybe, I don't know, your mom's not an alcoholic, right?  She could drink.  Okay, maybe.  But she's, you know, not like my dad.  Being that your dad grew up, you have a lot of issues with alcoholism.  No.  But that's, I do too.  I need a drink to handle this. 
[02:31:30]  Have a nice cold beverage.  Jesus.  That makes people very sensitive.  I feel like there's going to be an intervention.  So it makes, wait, wait, it makes you like, that spaghetti dish that bounced off that wall,  it bounced off the wall many times in marriage, even if it was in a bar, of course, that's  common sense.  It's, it's, it's about that.  So it bounced off the wall of your heart.  Yes, it did.  It's about, we're always reliving our childhood to try to fix what went wrong.  Adult child, why do you think abused girls marry abusive guys? 
[02:32:00]  It's childhood shit.  Well, because they know better.  Well, that's true.  Because they, they've seen a lesson being taught and they know the difference.  They better know better.  That's why I like boobies.  I was never breastfed.  Aww.  And Opie, uh, likes boobies.  I like boobies.  I'll admit it.  Because you're a guy.  That's why I thought the booby shoot thing would be hilarious.  And it sucked.  That explains, what Opie just said triggered something in me.  I do like breasts and I was breastfed, but I only like my mother's tits. 
[02:32:30]  Oh.  Rob's not used to this XM, man.  He's lit up food over there.  That's great.  You should check out ACLA.  No, I won't go to any.  Is there like an, uh, you got to go to a meeting and they all sit there and cry about their fucking  alcoholic parents?  No, it's not.  It's not like.  Let me tell you about my abusive father.  He was, uh, very abusive.  He drank whiskey and my enabling mother fed me stuff till I got so fat I almost exploded. 
[02:33:00]  Well, it's not that literal.  It's not.  Maybe therapy helps.  Do I have to stand up and say, hi, I'm Anthony and I'm an ACO.  What am I?  An LOL?  R-O-L-F-L-L?  Well, there are a lot of things.  Where do you want us to begin?  You're a land of love.  Are we being open here?  No, you don't have to.  See, but I only spent so many years.  Let me think about this because I, I spent, uh, my childhood years up until I was about  nine, I guess, with my father around here in New York, but he wasn't very around. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, always.  Oh yeah, no, no development takes place in the first nine years.  But he wasn't around a lot.  Oh, that's healthy.  Fear of abandonment.  That's good.  That's healthy.  But my mommy was very nice.  That's your selfishness, you know.  Yeah.  That's for yourself.  And then he went to California.  Right.  And, and, uh, you know, we lived with, uh, uh, my mother and she worked very hard.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, she wasn't around a lot cause she had to work a lot to take care of three  kids.  So it was like me, my brother and my sister.  Sure.  Pretty much.  And then I went out to California and, uh, lived with my father for like three years or 
[02:34:00]  so.  And, uh.  Or as we like to call them the dream weaver years.  Right.  Oh, wow.  Well, well.  Yes, Rob.  There's another one.  Jesus.  We gave Rob a great bit today.  Yes, you're right.  And who, who was the skanky flat chested one that your dad was banging?  Buzz?  Oh, oh.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  He had boobies, though.  No, Buzz had boobies.  Yeah.  He had nice boobies.  Oh, there were, there were a lot of skanks, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buzz, though.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Buzz.  The flat chested one was Richard.  Richard.  Richard was, Richard was a boy.  Yeah, he just got the two, uh, confused there, Rob.  The flat chested one was Richard.  It's hard.  It's hard.  Yeah.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Richard used to tap his foot in the tree house, and I would touch it with my foot, and  then there was a partition I would rub my hand under.  See, Ann has that, and Jimmy has Master Rain.  Do you have one of these, uh, little.  Well, no, not really.  No?  You'd have an uncle, you know, like an Uncle Paul, give me a little. 
[02:35:00]  Even almost, maybe.  One that would sneak in, maybe.  Fuck you, Nick.  Put a finger in your bottom.  Your bottom.  Yeah, straight, yeah.  Little Greg.  Ew.  The blonde-haired kid.  Hey, Paula, uh, because I was thinking of going down to Chuck E. Cheese, you in?  You know, a lot of them kids like to kiss more than you'd think they would.  They appreciate the mouth of an older gentleman.  I want to get about 40 bucks worth of tokens.  That should last just a couple of hours. 
[02:35:30]  What do you think?  Yeah, I like the tokens.  Holy shit.  You get a small, a small one.  They feel good with it.  So small.  You could pick them up and put them under your coat.  You know what's good about it?  When they're jerking you off, the little hands make your dick look bigger.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Oh.  No.  Huh?  Stop!  Who's playing the porno music?  My girlfriend hates Uncle Paul so much that I would do it, and then so she'll do Vera. 
[02:36:00]  Who's a Vera character?  It's awful.  Oh, Paul, I think you're divine.  It's the polar opposite of what Paul wants.  And so she hits on Paul.  Oh, Paul, you're so charming.  I'm like, shut up.  You're an older woman.  I don't like you.  So we'll actually have dialogues as Uncle Paul and Vera in my bedroom.  You're doing little plays in your house.  Little role playing.  It's really all, but neither character is sexy. 
[02:36:30]  And she just does Paul.  She does Vera to diffuse Paul.  But then I do Chip, who she hates even more.  Chip.  Chip is Paul's nephew.  She hates the way Chip taught.  Well, I told you, we almost broke up.  I was not exaggerating.  But Chip talked like this, like Uncle Paul menet me.  And she hates the way it is.  Oh.  Yeah, that's what she said.  Those voices creep me out.  It creeps her out so much that we literally had a for real fight about it.  And so what she'll do...  Jackets. 
[02:37:00]  I'll do Uncle Paul.  She'll do Vera.  And then I'll do Chip, who thinks Aunt Vera will protect him from a molesting Uncle Paul.  It's a fucking wonderful...  You know you have a keeper.  Make this one work.  I hope so, too.  But she just...  Yeah, she really...  By the way, people are reminding me that I have a marshmallow story, and I also was...  Yeah, but that's...  I almost got raped.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  By the marshmallow?  I was 25 at the time, but I almost got raped, all right?  Yeah, but the marshmallow thing, that was, you know, college hijinks. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Who hasn't done that?  I mean, come on.  That's really not gay if you're blindfolded.  You don't know.  Really?  Please.  She's like a marshmallow.  You can't tell.  Could be a marshmallow.  Could be a bare man's lips.  Who knows?  There you go.  Who knows?  Who knows who cares?  The first guy in line, it felt like a banana.  You must have been last up.  Nothing left.  Well, E-Rock's got the Bobby McGee and Mercedes-Benz just because Jimmy asked if your mom  drank, and we do have an example, but...  Oh, well, my mother would sing songs at family parties. 
[02:38:00]  We have parties out at their house, and we all maybe partake in some wine, and we had  a karaoke machine there a couple of years, and what?  She had a little fun singing.  I don't think she sounds maybe like she's had a few in this.  I don't think I need to go to...  What is it?  A-C-O-A.  Adult...  Adult Children of Alcoholics.  Children of...  Very heavy.  Of... 
[02:38:30]  Or Al-Anon.  Al-Anon.  Which is a little lighter, I think.  It's a big...  What does that stand for?  I don't know.  It's people who are married to alcoholics, who are in relationships with alcoholics, or  who have business...  It's like anyone...  Do they just...  Do you go to the meeting, and they go, leave?  Honestly, I've never been to Al-Anon.  Just leave.  I don't know.  But I know people that do go, and it's supposedly very helpful.  It's like...  Yeah, it's almost like...  Are you trying to help me?  No, I'm just chatting.  It's people who...  Oh, I have a problem? 
[02:39:00]  Well...  I'm not saying you have a problem.  No.  People are saying...  People are saying...  People in the same boat tend to relate to each other a little bit more, because there's  no money being made by anybody.  There's no motive for anybody to lie.  It's a bunch of people who just get it.  And it can be very helpful.  So you think I stayed in these...  The relationships didn't rock the boat, because I didn't want to rock the boat, because I  was in shitty situations.  The spaghetti bouncing off the wall.  Yeah, that was very tragic.  It's that awful...  Traumatic.  ...awful fucking...  Yes.  All these times, you would just cringe and cry and make it go away. 
[02:39:30]  Look inside yourself.  Yes.  And imagine that...  Awkward.  ...scared little...  Getting awkward in here.  ...boy with that fur coat.  Yes, with fur coat.  Think about...  Fur coat.  Fur coat.  All right, yeah, you just do the bell every time you do this one.  That's a good one.  Damn.  However...  Fur coat reference.  Now, the payoff is that this...  Because that's who Anthony really is.  He's not a mean guy.  He's not a Nazi.  He's that little, crying, sad boy... 
[02:40:00]  In the fur coat.  ...who likes to pet Jack-Jack.  That's who Anthony is.  Little Jack-Jack is adorable.  And he wants to look in his little microscope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a curious boy.  I'm curious.  I remember you used to talk about your microscope.  I had my microscopes and telescopes and science kits.  And Dad might have thought it was kind of faggoty.  No, that's when I made a puppet.  Right.  But it didn't have strings yet, so he yelled at me that I was playing with a doll.  But you did have the strings nearby, right?  No.  I didn't know how to put strings on it.  So I just carried him around, and he goes, you got a fucking doll with you. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, it's a puppet.  Ro!  Rosemary!  My fucking son's carrying a doll!  And she's like, Joey, shut the fuck up.  It's a puppet.  And I took the puppet to the store, and my father made me leave it in the car because he goes,  my fucking son isn't going to look like a fag walking through the goddamn supermarket  holding the doll.  ACOA aside, he was right about that one.  Right.  No, absolutely. 
[02:41:00]  I'll walk or not, no one wants to see a fucking sissy-ish Peter Pumper carrying a doll into  the stop-and-shop.  Yeah.  Fast forward.  Fucking Mexican wanted to fuck you in the bushes in California.  He knew.  Fast forward a few decades, 16,000 a hand, blackjack.  Comedic brilliance.  Well.  And Joey, very musical.  Dawn is a fucking high priestess.  I mean, the children all turned out very good.  You said comedic brilliance?  Yeah.  That means I had perfect parents. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, jeez.  Self-deprecation.  See, that's a self-deprecating humor.  But don't you-  And nobody's disagreeing with you either.  I know.  It'll make the message boards very happy.  Don't take Anthony-  See, he finally admitted he's not funny.  But don't take Anthony-  Look, he said it!  9.45 on Thursday.  He finally admitted he's not funny.  I'm an angry typing guy.  I'm sorry.  Taking a good thing about Anthony and making it a bad thing about you.  That's also from an odd childhood.  Oh, boy. 
[02:42:00]  God, is he going to bring his therapy onto this fucking radio show?  You can tell Jimmy's been going to therapy.  Holy dog shit.  Here we go.  Jimmy is a disaster.  All right.  What about my anger?  Which is a lot better, actually.  I would imagine that that comes from childhood stuff.  Of course, you know, childhood can be kind of crazy.  Things beyond your control.  And you grew up with a lot of brothers in it.  I think a large family might fuck a little people up.  Aside from the older ones and stuff.  See, you're one of the younger ones.  So you didn't get much attention. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  So you're like, you lash out to get attention.  Meanwhile, I didn't want much attention.  Maybe, I guess.  One thing you mentioned, though, is that I was always petrified driving with my father in California.  I remember every time getting into the truck, sitting there, petrified we were going off a cliff.  Because all the roads out there are like the Ortega Highway is this road that is just notorious for killing, having people killed.  It's a windy road. 
[02:43:00]  Like it was from that movie Duel with Dennis Weaver.  Oh, my God.  What a great movie.  That's what that road was like.  And I would sit in the passenger seat of the truck and wince whenever the tire would kind of hit the white line on the side.  I'd wince.  And, you know, Dad's got a beard between his legs.  And, you know, he's drinking and driving.  And we've come from some place where he's been pounding drinks and stuff.  And I would sit there petrified.  And when we got home, I'd be like, oh, like we made it. 
[02:43:30]  And can I say the beautiful thing is how he learned the lesson of that and gets a fucking Shelby and drunk drives a mat.  So me and Obi are wincing.  So now it's come full cycle.  Not only does he buy a fucking speed car, he has it shipped out so more horses are pulling.  See, I need it to go faster.  Dad's alcoholism is affecting us now directly.  And he hasn't been around for 12 years.  Dad didn't make you feel safe.  And now you have to make yourself feel unsafe.  Is that it? 
[02:44:00]  No, he overcompensates it to be safe.  That's why he has guns and locks and alarms and cameras.  Common sense.  And I live in a neighborhood chock full of the Jews.  Who are very safe.  They're very safe people.  Law-abiding people.  They're very nice community.  I want to talk to you about the Christmas decorations.  Right.  They have to go.  Oh, my house is lit up for Christmas.  Oh, I know they're just looking like, oh, they've ruined the neighborhood.  Do we need nine light-up Jesuses?  God damn Guinea. 
[02:44:30]  Move next door.  Oh, son of a bitch.  I like living amongst the Jews because I don't have to look out.  They're like alarms.  They know when people walk the streets who belongs there and who don't.  I love it.  Why do I like to be safe, Jimmy?  Because you didn't feel safe growing up.  That's true.  I didn't feel safe.  But also, part of it goes to common sense.  Like, you know, it's a normal thing to be afraid of home invasion.  But when it goes to the point of paranoia.  Anthony's not paranoid. 
[02:45:00]  Anthony likes the fans.  Yeah, you do.  You think about it more than most.  The guns and the horrible fear of things being taken away.  One, a 12-gauge shotgun.  I know that, but you know what?  And an AR-15.  It's fucking good.  And an AK-47.  And?  And an M1 Garand.  And?  And an English bunker in the backyard.  You got the bunker.  Hey, where does Anthony's selfishness come from, Jimmy?  I'm not selfish.  You admit it on the show all the time. 
[02:45:30]  I'm selfish as far as I like.  I'm a me person.  Me, me, me.  But I'm not selfish.  Like, I'm a very giving person.  Very generous guy.  But not of my time or myself.  Like, I'm giving materialistic.  You pick up checks for Christmas dinners.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll do things like that.  Yeah, that's very good.  Unlike some people.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  Hey.  I keep ringing that.  Hey.  T-Rex arms.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:46:00]  I don't like you anymore.  Anthony is not selfish in the sense that that's about also self-interest.  Oh, I had a thought.  I lost it.  Motherfucker.  Oh, no.  No, I forgot what I was going to say.  I didn't make it up.  I did have a point.  I forgot what it was.  Because I am.  I'm selfish with, like, me.  Me.  And my time.  Things like that.  I like being able to do what I want to do when I want to do it.  Bam.  But that's part of protection, too.  But I'll be generous with, like, money and stuff like that.  There's Jimmy's point.  Oh, part of it's fear.  Part of it's fear.  Like, when it comes to getting involved in external conflicts. 
[02:46:30]  It's like, you know, when you're a little boy and all you see.  Little Anthony.  Sweet Anthony, who's very sensitive and an artist at heart, is catching all of it at a creator.  And is hearing all this violence and craziness.  It's instinctive just to kind of cover up.  I did.  So, in the real world, when there's some shit happening, the instinct is just cover up.  And it's not about, I don't give a fuck.  It's about, I'm helpless and I can't stop it.  Hello, God.  It's me, little Anthony.  Yes.  God.  How much do I owe you, Jimmy? 
[02:47:00]  I mean, for the blowjob.  That's free.  That's just for showing up and getting on the couch.  That's to alleviate the tension.  It's called an icebreaker.  Dr. Norton knows how to relax.  Yes, he certainly does.  Should we play a song for Anthony today?  What?  I don't know.  I say something maybe that we would have heard on a Henry Winkler special is the type of song.  Oh, wow.  No, no, nothing about being molested.  I just think.  We have any Henry Winkler songs?  Anthony needs to know that he's not.  After school special? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, sweet little Anthony.  Because it affects the patterns of our lives.  Shit dick.  Do we have shit dick?  Hey.  Hey.  Another reference for that.  And old likes to be heard.  It's like you have so many brothers.  It's tough to be heard when you're that.  It's crazy.  So he gets fucking very mad and yells.  It's a way to fucking be heard.  How come I can't figure out anything wrong with Jimmy's upbringing?  We know all about his life.  He has a wonderful mother and father.  Wonderful. 
[02:48:00]  And his upbringing just seems to be his own fucking unraveling.  And he's paying hookers to shit on his chest.  Yeah.  Bing, bing.  But I don't know if it's always parents.  It's not always your parents.  Like, I don't know.  Oh, it's always your parents.  My parents are pretty normal.  You don't know if something might have happened.  Somebody in the neighborhood.  I'll put it to you this way.  Somebody in the neighborhood.  All right.  I saw my father quit drinking when I was two.  He got sober in December of 1970.  Wow.  He stopped drinking.  He's been sober since.  So, if I saw violence or screaming, because he was apparently a motherfucker. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  It was in the first two years.  I didn't know that.  So, yeah.  I probably saw...  Just because he wasn't drinking doesn't mean that he wasn't a dry drunk.  That's true, too.  You know, the behavior's still there.  He got...  Well, he got...  He did...  Let's just say he went to a place that helped somebody change behaviors, too.  But I've been sure for the first year or whatever, it was not pleasant.  Yeah.  So, maybe I saw craziness growing up, but I don't remember it.  Okay.  Wow.  So, it's so deeply embedded in you that you love getting shit on your chest. 
[02:49:00]  Maybe they had a fight one time, and my mother threw Tootsie Rolls at him, and it hit  his chest, and then she said, I love you, and I said, that's what love is.  A Tootsie Roll on your chest, and maybe he fell into the glad bed, and lemonade spilled  off the counter, and I'm like, I got it.  And he gargled with it, and then Gene Simmons threw him down the stairs.  You know, my fantasies about being hurt, I would always fantasize about, not just with  Kiss, but when I was in high school, my fantasies would be that I was being savagely beaten in 
[02:49:30]  the cafeteria, like bloodied with bats in front of a girl who liked me, and then she would  love me.  It was this lunatic fantasy about being really hurt.  That is so odd.  I would have fantasies of girls that would need help, and I would come in, you know, as  like the hero in hell.  Sure, it's hard to rescue, when you couldn't rescue mother in a tough situation.  Oh, see, maybe that was it.  But didn't you have some fantasy woman who was an older...  Helen.  Helen.  Wasn't Helen, I mean, now what does that say? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know, but Helen looked, she had a...  I was a fucking little tranny lover.  I don't know where Helen was from, Rob.  Helen.  I don't know who Helen was.  Jimmy, I want you shit through me.  I don't even remember which...  Helen.  I can picture her face.  She had a beehive, right?  She had a beehive hairdo.  My mother did, too, though, in her wedding photo, so maybe it was a representation of that  mother.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why don't we play booby-choo and bring the show back together?  Booby-choo?  What?  Why?  Because they're going to start making their own versions out there. 
[02:50:30]  They need a reference point.  Oh, look at the little panda.  It's adorable.  You know how nice some fucking red paint would look all over this stupid white hairdo?  Hair do.  They just washed him.  Pop him in the microwave to dry him off.  He's so clean.  He's a cute little panda.  You pick him up and he fucking claws your thorax, little ungrateful cunt.  They have no fucking love for the fact that we slaughtered their mother to make a rug and  now we're raising you on a bottle in a cold fucking cage. 
[02:51:00]  Fuck pandas.  All right.  On the way, man suits cops to get his massive porn collection back.  We still haven't talked about that, which is a great story.  And sisters put dead mother in cold storage, visit it, and put makeup on her.  Did you get to the sexiest story of the day?  Which one?  Yes.  Did he tease that one?  Which one?  About the...  Can I guess which one you're thinking of?  Okay.  Let me guess.  Hookers on Craigslist.  Nah, not sexy.  Rabid, bear, tritent.  Nah.  No.  Judge accused of paddling inmates. 
[02:51:30]  Hot, but not the sexiest.  Not as sexy.  I would fill up reading that.  Uh, Napal Airlines sacrifices two goats to Sky God.  Not sexy or surprising.  Uh, Virginia teen, uh, charged with raping, killing sister, beating toddler niece with  sledgehammer.  I would say that's the sexiest slash funniest.  It has everything in there that makes it a great story.  That kid snapped.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, we got the audio. 
[02:52:00]  Just snapped.  Not of the, uh, crime, but we have the audio.  Well, I would hope not.  Yeah, well, uh, well, in honor of somebody in this room, I guess, it's the touching song.  Oh.  We'll do the touching song instead of booby-choo.  Oh, right.  You are never to blame.  To blame.  Yeah.  Henry Winkler song.  Here's that special Fonz he did.  Hey, it ain't right for someone to touch you, unless it's Chuck, who we fired for season  two.  Don't let him fuck your mouth while Tom Bosley fingers your asshole.  That doesn't sound like Henry Winkler. 
[02:52:30]  We got the point, though.  Rob Bartlett, September 15th, Comedy Connection, in Saugus, Massachusetts.  Yes, sir.  All right.  When are you going to curse more?  Fuck.  There you go.  He's doing great.  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is the word, though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis, so no matter what you've heard, remember that penis is the proper word.  And vulva is what girls have down below. 
[02:53:00]  Even though most people call it vagina, and some children call it Virginia.  Vulva.  When she's naked, it will show.  All girls have a vulva, so no matter what you've heard, remember that vulva is the proper word.  Our anus is a useful thing indeed.  The anus gives relief in time of need.  We all have an anus, so no matter what you've heard, remember that anus is the proper word. 
[02:53:30]  So don't be appalled, because that's what they're called.  And each of them's the proper word for private pause.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  It's cute, Fred.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  My friends all drive for shit.  I'm a snake in the eye. 
[02:54:00]  We're hard on my life with no help from my friends.  Shut your yap.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Shoot him now!  Shoot him now!  Not on your goddamn radio!  Hey!  Shut up!  This is retarded.  Oh, stop it!  Shut your mouth!  What the hell is going on? 
[02:54:30]  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, hey, hey!  Shut up!  Hey, hey, hey!  Shut up!  Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord!  Shut up, stupid!  Oh, Lord!  God damn, is that funny?  Not on your goddamn radio!  Oh, what a bitch!  Oh, my damn, the son of a bitch!  No!  Open an enemy. 
[02:55:00]  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Rob Bartlett in studio from Imus' old show.  I just asked Rob, because one of the fucking favorite things on Imus' show for me was Fred  Imus, Imus' brother.  And I'm like, I didn't want to ask Rob, because I did want to know if it was a character.  I thought it was like a character.  I'm like, I don't want that wall broken.  And I'm like, it's his real brother, and he said it really was unscripted.  What a funny fuck.  And they look alike.  Oh, do they?  You too?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's very obvious, Don.  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's great.  What happened?  I just love the...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  What's with the shit on the chest?  Oh, please.  Yeah.  All right, people are suggesting we play this today, and then we got to do that story, and  then that thing, and then, I don't know, then we get out of here, right?  Oh, I...  When Gina McKee was at this convenience store, she says she saw a man stealing someone's 
[02:56:00]  wallet, so she confronted him.  He immediately starts just going off.  I didn't take nothing.  The police can come, and so then I get out of the car.  I'm like, you know, the police are on their way.  Don't leave.  According to McKee, the suspect, Lemuel Voorhees, started screaming and throwing punches.  Then, she says, he took off his prosthetic leg and hit her with it.  He says Voorhees even picked up his bike and threw it at her.  A few minutes later, police showed up. 
[02:56:30]  She says it was worth it.  If it was to happen again, I'd do the same thing.  Police say the suspect has a record that goes back 15 years.  They are investigating the missing wallet, but Voorhees is facing assault charges for  hitting McKee with his prosthetic leg.  Wait, he threw the leg in the bike.  If you're committing a crime, why was he using his only modes of transportation?  Both of them.  As weapons.  I got to get away.  Let me throw my leg in my bike.  What are you doing?  Keep the leg on, use the bike, and go with the wallet. 
[02:57:00]  And yet he had a life of crime.  He had quite the career.  Never learned.  Yeah.  Where's the makeup story, Jimmy?  You might have that one.  Which one, sweetie?  Well, it was added to the old show prep in between shows.  Oh, there's Stan.  Running out of the bathroom.  Oh, Stan's pulling his pants up.  It's not that important, Stan.  Buckling up.  I like that.  That's a go-getter.  Atta boy.  If he was a go-getter, he would have shit on commercial break. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, true.  He's a lactose intolerant lump.  Well, maybe he just met Clinton.  Yeah, that's true.  He might have just met Clinton.  That's a button.  Oh, no, that was from today.  Matt, you're still hurt.  From the green room.  Hey, we get an apology.  I think you deserve to be heard.  God.  All right.  Sisters keep mother's body in cold storage.  What do you got on this, Jimmy? 
[02:58:00]  Well, they highlight a lot of it.  A lot of reading.  Because you're almost every week, according to their family,  these two sisters, they pay a visit to their mother  and to make sure she's looking her best.  Uh-oh.  It's a devotion that transcends death and social convention  because she died ten years ago.  Since then, these two ghoulish cunts have kept her in cold storage.  Wait a minute.  My copy is different.  I don't see ghoulish.  I'm looking for ghoulish cunts. 
[02:58:30]  There's a little carrot put in.  It was written over.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We'll have to take your word for that.  These two ghoulish cunts have kept their dead mother in cold storage  in a funeral parlor in northwest London.  And I knew it was London because parlor is spelled O-U-R.  Oh, there you go.  Parlor.  Her body, which was treated in formaldehyde,  it's wasted since then, according to a relative.  But since she's British and her personality was so fucking dead and sick,  they've only known she's been dead for six weeks.  Ba-dum-boom.  Erp.  Boom. 
[02:59:00]  Cock meat.  Nothing but.  Uh, below the...  Cock meat.  Nothing but.  Cock meat.  Might be on to a new bed.  Below the waist.  Nothing but.  Her corpse is said to have withered to a skeleton.  Ugh.  Above it, tight leathery skin stretches over the bone.  If that's not things done in exactly the wrong order, what is?  Below the waist is exactly the part you want to remain leathery.  Who cares?  No offense, ladies.  But if you're rotted away from the hips up, we don't give a shit. 
[02:59:30]  We love you.  But if some part of you has got to remain, it's got to be the...  That is really a creepy image.  That they're, like, dressing her up, and she's rotted away.  Well, the body is degraded to the extent that it's just a skeleton with a bit of stretched,  scaly skin over the head.  It's horrific, like a character from a horror film.  Well, we like to put lots of blush on her.  She makes her look rather lifelike. 
[03:00:00]  And it's beautiful.  She's beautiful in death.  Once she assumed room temperature, we thought it would be best to make her look better than she does.  And the skin, especially around, you know, her naughty bits is a little dry.  So we use more strides.  I remember the day her anus fell off.  I remember that.  That was tragic.  Yes.  Quite tragic.  We put it back on with a little bit of eye shadow.  You know, the eye sockets, of course, now are empty, which causes us to use a lot more, you know, of the eye shadow. 
[03:00:30]  So there's quite a shadow with a hole left by the rotting of the eyes.  It's hard to bring her beautiful eyes out when they've fallen out years ago just using makeup.  Yes.  And, of course, you know, there's lots of perfume is used.  Lots of perfume.  Extentious.  Yes.  Sent for a case of Charlie.  Yes.  We douse her body in it too. 
[03:01:00]  The wacky Betty Hill music.  A post-mortem examination of their mother's death reportedly revealed that she died from an embolism brought on by a leg vein from horses.  Cool.  They were unhappy about the verdict of the autopsy, so they wanted a second opinion.  But apparently no health or safety violations have been breached, and the corpse does not smell.  No law is saying people can't keep a corpse for years after registering the death, though it's normal to bury it. 
[03:01:30]  But you can keep it.  Wow.  England's weird.  Are we allowed to keep a corpse?  No.  No.  I would love to.  There's some kind of health problems.  Why not?  You would love to.  Oh, please.  Well, not officially.  Yeah, the ones you obviously say, but they don't know.  Just to humiliate its body.  Oh, look at Michael J. Fyre.  I love the way he, look, no disrespect, but he always looks like he's just shifting around naturally.  Like, he makes sure he's moving.  Oh, this poor bastard.  He gesticulates a lot.  He's like, yeah, well, you know, hey, and he leans a lot on one elbow and then back.  Here he is.  Hey, we're out. 
[03:02:00]  Oh.  He's animated.  He's very, yes.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  He's like three of the five lords of Flatbush.  He talks nothing.  That was such an obscure reference.  And we're just looking at him.  And we're distracted, Jimmy.  Oh, sorry.  Hey, shrug, shrug.  You're okay.  You're okay.  You can't pull Perry King out of your ass and expect us to go crazy.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Oh.  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  What an awful disease.  It really is, man. 
[03:02:30]  That is horrid.  He just...  What is he taking for it?  Caffeine pills?  Oh, my God.  You know what's a shame is that he could not use the Back to the Future machine to help  himself out.  He should be able to.  That is what I call irony, my friend.  He should be able to.  He should be able to get in that car and go to the future and find a cure and come back.  Oh, how ironic, though.  He'd get in and his hands are shaking so much he can't set the date.  Yeah.  He went up in ancient Roman times.  And he's shaking.  They think he's a witch.  And he'd try to go to the past.  He'd go to the future.  It'd be even worse. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, there he is.  You're right, though.  He does.  Poor guy, man.  He's constantly trying to move to make it look like he's not moving.  Like he's holding his arm.  What a torture.  I think he's just trying to get away from Rachel Ray.  Dude, he is.  Looks like a lot of.  Ah, the old family ties, dude.  Torture.  Justine Bateman.  His wife is beautiful, too.  What a fucking poor bastard.  I did a Law & Order with her.  She's great.  His wife?  Yeah, Tracy Paul.  Yeah, that's his wife. 
[03:03:30]  Poor fucking guy.  Sure.  What did you do for Law & Order?  I did six episodes of SVU as Milton Schoenfeld, defense attorney.  Oh.  I don't know why this, you know.  Jew.  You know, it's the funniest thing.  It's like I made a career.  This Catholic kid from Long Island has made a career out of playing old, fat Jews.  You played a Jew.  Nice.  Mushnick in Little Shop.  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  Get the fat Jew guy.  That's fucking...  Yeah, I did an episode with Winkler, with the Fonz. 
[03:04:00]  Did you really?  Yes, I was his attorney.  Please, what was he arrested for?  Was it Animal Cruel Sheet for jumping a shark?  Hey.  He had his leather jacket on.  That's kind of like his armor, you know?  Thank God he was all right.  No, he hired somebody to kill his wife, and it didn't happen, and she only got maimed.  Did he?  Ah.  And, um...  Oh, my God.  And it was...  I didn't get him off. 
[03:04:30]  How could you?  No.  Ralph Mouth told!  He hired Patsy!  Patsy.  To kill Marion Ross so he could fuck shortcake in her dumper.  And Jenny Piccolo.  Oh, Jenny Piccolo was known as the ass eater.  When Fonz was deep digging shortcake, old Piccolo would come in and nose-fuck his ass after  spitting into it.  And Pat Morita would take pictures.  And he'd go, ffft!  Quiet, ffft!  And Al Molinaro would come in.  Yes.  With his big tuna can cock. 
[03:05:00]  And people would use his nose as a bidet.  Yes, of course.  And big tuna can cock.  A lot of people don't know that his character was gay on Happy Day.  Oh?  And what he would do is go to the hardware store under the guise of asking Mr. C to look  for nails on the bottom shelf, and then he would throat fuck them.  He would take his big cock and throat fuck Mr. C.  Why do you think they called him Mr. C?  To this day, I didn't know, but thank you, Jimmy. 
[03:05:30]  He puts a whole new perspective on things for you.  We all know it.  Nobody wanted to admit it.  It is Fun Fact Thursday, so...  Well, you know what?  I think there's a lot of those old sitcoms from the 70s that had that underlying tension.  Yeah, there's a lot of it.  You know?  Different strokes?  Big time.  Well, you know, with the stroke, man.  There you go.  Absolutely.  Who didn't want to molest Dudley after that fucking bathtub episode?  Good old Mr. Carlson.  Get in here, you fucking...  You and your fucking big-tooth father. 
[03:06:00]  Fucking Dudley's father had some choppers.  They made...  Who were left in my turn?  I don't know, fenced teeth.  Oh, that fucking Dudley was rapable.  By the way, Rob Bartlett did say this blue from Kentucky.  Breaking news.  Bartlett couldn't get Henry Winkler off.  That's right.  Yep.  I guess he'll be isolating that one.  Yes.  Eee.  Everyone, I love looking at IMDb, because everyone has done one of those shows. 
[03:06:30]  There's not an actor living in New York who hasn't done at least one.  I love those.  I've never done one.  I could never get one.  I try our audition.  Really?  Dude, you've seen me.  I didn't do it.  I would have thought SVU.  I mean, come on.  You're a walking sex crime.  I know.  No.  Come on.  You can play a good weirdo kind of...  Look at those eyes.  Adam did one.  Adam played a pedo.  He was...  Yeah.  On Law and Order.  What's he saying?  Can you hear Michael G. Fox? 
[03:07:00]  Like, shoot me.  Poor guy, man.  He's just...  He's doing an interpretive dance.  He's not shaving.  I don't blame him.  Oh, my God.  Would you put a razor down on him?  How does he shave?  That's a great question.  Is Rachel Ray asking him that?  Let's listen in.  It's been in operation for about a year and a half.  Something like that.  It's so fantastic.  And we've raised, through that arm, over a million dollars.  So it's been...  Over a million dollars.  Anyone else noticing the squeaky chair?  I know.  They couldn't get a chair that, you know... 
[03:07:30]  That squeak?  That doesn't squeak.  Dude, a cement block would squeak.  Listen to the chair.  Listen to the chair.  It's a fun activity for your family, too, you know, to get your family out there and  giving back to...  Absolutely.  And then you can go to our website, michaeljfox.org, which is easy for me to remember.  Yeah, write it down.  And it'll lead you to the magic of the interweb.  It'll walk you through the whole Team Fox thing.  It'll lead you to how to do it.  Overall, though, you've raised $90 million as a foundation.  $90 million. 
[03:08:00]  So when has the progress been?  After $90 million, you shouldn't still look like you've been tased.  There's been good progress.  Anything like this is very tricky because a lot of times you have to...  The things that may help, you have to help get to those things, you know?  Right.  In other words, you...  There's a lot of layers to the...  Yeah, before you pick the apple, you've got to plant the tree.  Exactly.  So there's a lot of stuff like that, but...  Do they have any more?  Why is he wearing a leather?  Because you can get a leather, too.  Leather is squeaky.  Don't wear a leather jacket. 
[03:08:30]  A bird in a hand is worth, what, three spilled drinks?  A disease like this right now, which is called dyskinesias.  A bird in my hand equals a lot of feathers on the floor.  That's right.  And one sad kid if he's watching.  And you have to wait to see how the tree...  What kind of...  All right.  All right.  She's like, enough about the moose.  Take a kiss, you stupid cunt.  You're amazing.  Hey, that was your first cunt.  That was my first cunt.  Thank you.  That's a special thing.  Oh, fo.  Daddy's first cunt. 
[03:09:00]  We'll have a party gift for you.  That's the magic word.  Why does she say you look like you're in hell?  Like, not in a bad way,  is this torture for you to be moving like this?  It'd be every time I see them myself.  Well, she's not exactly an interviewer.  I know.  Our goal is cure.  Wearing a bubble wrap shirt would be a bad idea.  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, what?  Wait, no.  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  No, I'll make the cappuccino.  We're still talking about the flapjacks, okay?  We'll make the flapjacks.  All right, make flapjacks.  You want to shake with that? 
[03:09:30]  I'm sorry.  I mean, how do you keep the faith in...  I'm so awful.  I'm being terrible.  Obviously, we don't need the blender today.  We'll just have you hold the batter.  Oh, my God.  He can't even tell his kid he's moving the car.  I'll be right there.  I'm parking, son.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  All right.  You know.  I'm all right.  You know.  And here he goes.  And the thing goes for your health sense.  And I think that, like we said,  it's amazing when you give people the tools to do things 
[03:10:00]  that they can do them and want to do them.  And we think we've put enough tools out there  that we'll make this happen.  And I'm sure you get a lot of faith, you know,  from being a part of that community, you know.  That community?  Building this big, huge network of...  Shaky Americans?  I was going to call it the Earthquake.  Earthquake Americans.  It's a place I know where Michael J. Fox goes.  Call Bedrock.  Twitch, Twitch.  My kids are a force of nature.  You know, if I'm him, I'm sitting there,  I'm looking at her going, 
[03:10:30]  why isn't this you?  Why do I have to be the lucky one?  How did they get a picture of him?  Man, you must be tired.  Oh.  Talking about all the kids he's had.  When I say I, Tracy has something to do with it.  Yeah, she had a little to do with it.  She did a lot to do with it.  Well, you tried to get it in.  You know, what about, I mean,  you and Tracy have been together.  What am I going to be a human?  This is awful.  That is it.  They are clapping more than the Danza show.  I mean, you got any secrets 
[03:11:00]  that they're wearing like a super hot chat?  Oh.  Oh.  Unless he's trying to pray.  Oh, shit.  But also that, um...  Why do we do this?  I think that, you know,  it's just like anything.  It's one day at a time.  Yeah.  And trust that, you know,  your partner...  I can't remember the show he was on.  Give him room, cut him some slack.  Oh, one day at a time.  I'm going to make it that way.  I'm sorry.  And you're getting out of your own situation  and letting the other person be who they are.  Give him room.  She's great.  Give him room room. 
[03:11:30]  And she's the cook in the family.  She's an amazing cook.  Of course she is.  Although I'd like to say...  I make the popcorn.  ...he did mention off air.  Now I'm reiterating.  He did make one meal once.  Yep.  I had to cook a meal one day.  Yeah.  Did you know he was this bad?  We haven't seen him in a while.  I've seen him bad and I've seen him okay.  I was in charge of cooking a meal one day.  So I took the Rachel Ray cookbook off the shelf.  And I made biscuits and gravy.  And then I picked it up off the floor.  And they had biscuits, gravy, and chicken,  and they were amazing.  It was good, right?  Yay! 
[03:12:00]  Why are you clapping?  Biscuits and gravy are clapping like circus seals.  You know, I hope you find it as entertaining as I do.  I was thinking about all of the great, wonderful entertainment  you've given us over the years.  And I thought about, you know,  if you could have one of those cats back over for dinner,  you know, would it be Alex?  Eh, a little nerdy.  Would it be Teen Wolf?  Good appetite there.  Probably a very good eater.  Who would you invite over out of all the people you had to be?  Wow, what character?  The me before this. 
[03:12:30]  Exactly.  Alex.  Really?  I just love you.  More clapping.  I like Tina Yoners because she hasn't worked since.  That fucking non-Hollywood name.  Alex was great because he was, you know,  I was young and he kind of helped me express a lot of things  that I felt and I thought.  He was just a blast.  He was an interesting way to work out.  That's just terrible to watch.  Yeah, I mean, I never thought about that,  but you probably learned a lot.  Marty, what's with the shaking?  Yeah, I could do a lot of things through Alex  that I couldn't do myself.  And he was, you know, smarter than me. 
[03:13:00]  He's not smarter than you now.  You caught up and you dusted Alex.  Let me tell you.  And he also hooked me up with my wife.  That's right.  Why are they clapping?  I remember that episode so well.  What is what the, why, is an applause sign going on?  Is that what it is?  Would you think?  They feel compelled.  Yeah, oh God.  To sing a song that says dance.  And they're singing a song that says applause.  It's just awkward.  Don't forget, you know, if you go to our website,  we'll drive you to his website so you can join Team Fox  because that's what we did today. 
[03:13:30]  Thank you so much, Michael.  We love you, baby.  We love you, baby.  Nice Kojak sign off your fucking self-serve.  You want a hug or shake?  Why don't we say hi to Jason in Wisconsin?  Jason, what's up?  Uh-oh.  Hey, what's up?  Michael J. Fox cooks the shake and bake at home.  Oh, shit.  You know, he waited on hold for a really long time.  Yeah, just for that.  For a shake and bake joke.  It said he wanted to donate money to the cause. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  Yeah.  That really is uncomfortable to watch, man.  He's a young guy, man.  It just looks tiring.  They say it's tiring.  It looks exhausting.  What torture, man.  Yeah.  How can they not fucking fix that?  That sounds like something you could just like fix with muscle relaxers.  Because they don't want to fund stem cells.  Yeah, see, stem cell research would be great for that.  Thankfully, Bush will be out of office soon.  And I really started to hate him because of the stem cell.  It's like, God damn it, man.  Fucking guys like that or Chris Reeve. 
[03:14:30]  It's like, why?  I don't think they can help Christopher Reeve now.  Not at all.  But I mean, you know.  I don't think so.  Other people, you know.  Sleeping there.  Bottom half rotting in the chair.  The top half just taut skin.  With whatever team won the series that year's hat on.  And the kids putting makeup.  Putting makeup.  Superman cape on.  They take his arms.  And they prop his arms out with like two sticks.  Like he's flying.  But he isn't.  He's just a rotted corpse sitting there with his arms out. 
[03:15:00]  Like a goose.  Hey, let's go.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Look.  Right where we left him.  It's Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  Uh, Fred.  Happy engagement, Opie.  Happy engagement.  Oh, thank you, sir.  When, um, Tracy cooks.  Is Michael in charge of scrambling the eggs?  Here come the jokes.  You know, do we have to continue down this road?  Thank you, Fred.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Rob Bartlett in the studio today. 
[03:15:30]  September 15th.  Comedy Connection.  In Saugus, Massachusetts.  617-248-9700.  And then St. John's in October.  October 6th.  All right.  I've got to turn my board on.  What?  Ah, E-Rock.  Why do I have to turn your board on for that?  Because I have to play it.  Oh, E-Rock.  I thought you used to have to email it to somebody else.  Oh.  Yeah, good way to embarrass Opie.  Oh, Cunningham, I'm gay. 
[03:16:00]  I just barked mouth.  He said sit on it, so I did.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, we're having a lot of fun with Rob Bartlett today here on XM Satellite Radio.  He's cursing for the first time on the radio.  Hey, nothing, nothing. 
[03:16:30]  Where's the fucking wiffle ball back?  Yeah.  We had to retire that baby.  That's actually still at the other studio.  Is it?  In the office.  Is it in one of those cases?  It is.  Yes.  In a glass case.  It still has the original markings on it, but because of health reasons, we had to retire.  And another reason.  Well.  The girl that kind of pushed it in too hard.  Well, that's the health I'm talking about.  Oh, okay.  The health of a woman's womb.  The bat got sick.  There was two drunk girls, and the one drunk girl didn't realize that it could be a problem 
[03:17:00]  if she pushed it in.  She shoved it in.  Her cervix was around the thing like a donut, a batting donut.  Who got the record?  Wow.  Some whore.  Jimmy.  The record for what?  Fucking one of those girls in what's now Ron and Fez's office over at X-Men?  Hey!  Hey!  Paula!  No bag, no nothing.  Whoa!  Oh!  Hey!  Oh!  She was over 18.  I fucked her good.  No bag, no nothing. 
[03:17:30]  She was so drunk, she collapsed on the floor.  So I put my stinky dick away and walked out.  Thanks for nothing, Toots.  And he laughed.  After she fucking slimed on my cock.  You'll never remember this, and if there's a God, neither will I.  Wow.  You fucking alky.  Look at that.  Daddy's filling up.  Would you fucking like a lion?  Those two second, like, just...  She had fat pussy lips, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we bring in a birthday cake?  For who? 
[03:18:00]  Jimmy the fuck.  Why not?  Whose birthday is it today?  It's Sam's birthday.  Oh, okay.  Little Sam.  How old is Sam today?  He looks like a Pes dispenser.  13 of Pes dispensers.  See?  Candy comes out of his head.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hi, Sam.  Sam, it's your birthday today?  Yeah.  Have they been easy on you back there?  Not making you work as hard because it's your birthday?  Do you work hard anyway?  I don't know what you do. 
[03:18:30]  I work very hard.  You do?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you. 
[03:19:00]  Pour it off your ankle and put those out?  What do you mean the cake?  That is the weirdest looking kid I've ever seen in my life.  He's awful.  It's like you're two guys to the left on the evolution age.  Really?  Yeah, we don't know, man.  We don't know.  We think there's a little bit of African in him, but he's so white that it doesn't make  sense.  He doesn't want to acknowledge that there might be a little African blood. 
[03:19:30]  He's related to Thomas Jefferson.  He really has genealogy back.  So that kind of makes sense because we all know Tom liked to go out to the shed out back  and maybe grab a couple.  The whale shaped ice cream cake says, have a whale of a birthday, you non-rice eating faggot.  Oh, right, because you don't like to eat rice.  And the odd thing is, that wasn't made for you.  That was just a leftover cake.  They're still making a fudgy the whale cake. 
[03:20:00]  Is that a fudgy the whale cake?  It's a fudgy the whale.  Oh, I love that.  Super smooth, super rich, caramel ice cream.  Tom Carmel, man.  Oh.  That was a staple of growing up in this area.  Yeah.  I don't know about any other places.  He was pretty much just northeast.  Yeah, but I used to do the bit everywhere.  I went on the road.  Oh, who cared, right?  Yeah.  He's a great character.  And thinny thin for your fatty, fat friends.  You could say that on his commercial. 
[03:20:30]  Thinny thin for your fatty, fat friends.  That's the first day on Wednesday and Sunday.  You buy one, you get one free.  There's a great outtake of one of the commercials he did where they have, you know, he said,  we're here.  We always interview the people who own the places, you know.  Yeah, the franchises.  Yeah, we're here in New York with a habijim abunud.  What are you, Hindu?  Does he really say that?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we already made the first day. 
[03:21:00]  It's great.  The guy was, like, 90 years old.  He's dead now, right?  The old Tom Carvel, yeah.  Hey, E-Rock, can you play one of these for us?  By the way, it's a fish cakey, because it's a whale, and, you know, it's a fish cakey.  Oh, I didn't even get the joke.  It's a fish cake.  Jesus.  He's got a forehead like a handball cord.  He's all cock and all forehead.  If he wasn't all cock and all forehead, he'd be a foot tall.  There are two worse things it could be.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:21:30]  Well.  He's part of one of those.  Oh, jeez.  Who said that?  Greg, can we keep him away from the cake?  What is that?  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Stan.  You're welcome.  I didn't say Jimmy.  Jimmy does have, he has the best visual bits on radio today.  But that got a nothing until Stan looked over.  What is that?  Let me see.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Don't.  Oh, no.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't wreck the cake.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What are you doing?  I want a piece of cake, but I don't want anyone fucking with it. 
[03:22:00]  He's sawing away at the cake.  What is he afraid of?  Everything.  Don't you put your dick on this cake.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't mess with the cake.  He's afraid of it.  Don't fuck with it.  Hey, what's.  You open the forks.  Jesus, Ant.  You open the forks.  Why are you walking around like a hunchback?  No, I'm not.  No.  I promise.  No. 
[03:22:30]  Jimmy, don't.  I want a piece, too.  No.  Did he pull his penis out?  No.  Did he?  Dan?  You don't fuck with food.  He doesn't fuck with food.  I don't mess with food.  All right.  Give me a piece of the ass.  I can't cut it.  What is this?  Oh, my God.  Not that it matters at this point, but remember we started the show talking about Pavarotti?  Yeah.  CNN.com now says, Heaven now has a tenor.  No way.  About Pavarotti.  We made this joke. 
[03:23:00]  Is it true?  Go to CNN.com there, E.  Oh.  Okay.  Do you know that he actually did an album of hits of the 70s and 80s?  Who?  Pavarotti.  Who's Pavarotti?  Luciano Pavarotti.  Who's he?  Why don't you just...  Something happened with him?  No, I wasn't talking about it.  Fine.  I think a lot of...  You're taking that Brian Wilson character a little too seriously.  Well, no.  Losing your mind there.  Happy birthday to you.  We have another cake coming in for Sam? 
[03:23:30]  No.  Do we?  Is it one of those novelty cakes?  And we have a present that has arrived for Sam?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Your stripper's there at the cake.  It's a fucking gross burger.  How's the ice cream cake?  How's the ice cream cake, Jimmy?  It's...  I haven't tried it yet.  Hi, Andrea.  Oh, no.  It's Andrea, the worst cook ever.  The worst cake maker ever.  She makes the worst fucking cakes.  But she's got an excuse every time. 
[03:24:00]  That looks like a mac and cheesecake.  Um...  What the fuck is that?  It's like apple and cinnamon and raisins.  And it's got cuties on one side and Haagen-Dazs on the other.  It's like an ice cream coffee cake.  I'll never eat that.  And what pills did you drop into the batter by accident?  I didn't even know.  You would never eat that, right?  Why not?  It's good.  Someone should have a bite of Angela's cake.  Yeah, someone...  It looks like a meatloaf.  It's going to bite into Angela's cake.  Yeah, it's awful.  Tony.  Where's Tony?  Well, where's Pat?  It looks like...  I swear to you.  It looks like that dead English woman put some makeup on him. 
[03:24:30]  Put some makeup on that.  It's just taut flesh.  That is like...  Rob, what do you think she's on?  It's an apple like you like.  We've been trying.  No, that looks horrible.  11 herbs and spices.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes?  You are the worst cook ever.  It's a mist cakage.  It's chocolate placenta.  Gross burger's going to try it.  Of course he is.  All right.  It's tinfoil you're eating. 
[03:25:00]  It's not bad.  It does.  It's Hoganaz.  Vanilla ice cream.  Well...  Yeah?  How do you ruin that?  Watch.  Wow, he put that whole thing in it.  He could put her in his mouth.  How is it?  It's a little bland, but it's not bad.  Well, the Hoganaz makes it easy.  He's going to shovel it in.  Yeah, this guy is shoveling.  It's a little bland.  It's a tire.  Slow down.  The spark's coming up your floor.  Really?  Look at him go. 
[03:25:30]  Jesus.  It's Morgaine.  Nobody's going to take it away from you.  Yeah, no one's rushing to take a piece.  That was a bad bite.  That was a bad bite.  That's the other side.  That was the part with the ass in it.  That's the healthy ice cream on the other side.  Oh, my God.  She's got a Belugi, a little extra frosting.  She put a little strudel icing on it.  I put cuties on the other side.  Cuties.  Cuties.  That's that tofu ice cream, right?  Yeah.  Andrea, that cough does not sound good.  Are you all right?  I know. 
[03:26:00]  She's been fucking eating cigars.  When you live with somebody with emphysema, it's just not healthy.  Does he smoke?  No.  You don't catch emphysema?  You don't catch emphysema?  What, don't you put paper down in the toilet?  If you want to hear my life story, no.  How do you...  But you're blaming that on living with someone with emphysema.  I just had a bad cough.  No, she's trying to imitate the person she's living with.  Oh, okay.  She's doing impressions.  That's a good one.  That's emphysema.  Here's the person I'm living with. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, she's slipping on the candy.  How funny would it be if she fell face first into that stupid cake?  Can I put this down?  It's really heavy, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.  Is it heavy?  A cake shouldn't be heavy.  You know that, right?  Did you make two of that?  What the hell's in it?  No, this is...  I put...  Oh, she's putting her thumb in it?  I put these ice cubes that are wrapped in plastic.  In fact, I got these...  I bet that's tastier than the cake.  She was the worst cook ever.  She's horrible at this.  I try. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's really sad.  That really doesn't mean shit.  Wait, you sent me...  By the way, I didn't listen to her.  Andrea sent me...  She sings, and you sent me a song.  Oh, what song?  It's a parody of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  And instead I wrote Don't Swear Over FM Radio.  Oh, let's hear it.  I don't remember...  Do you have it?  Not with me.  Actually, I emailed it to Sam.  Or Than.  I emailed it to the show.  One of them.  But I don't...  I mean, I don't... 
[03:27:30]  I don't remember all the words.  When you're making that, do you think it's going to be good?  Like, do you...  I didn't know it was going to be this color.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How many parents have said that one?  They see their daughter's son.  Please tell me it was supposed to be a vanilla cake or something.  Keep coughing over the cake, honey.  Yeah, she's just...  That much more appetizer.  Oh, Jesus.  Sam, you've got to stop him from coughing over the cake. 
[03:28:00]  He's going to get everybody sick.  Wow.  Great Quincy.  Yes.  He does the best Quincy.  The only Quincy.  And I also do Alan Alda, but I'm sure you know that.  Oh, yeah.  He's in town.  He's on Regis and Kelly, and I thought he might be on the show.  Yes!  Yes!  Because he was...  That movie, same time next year.  He was booked on the show today, and he moved it.  Well, that's why I brought the cake.  Moved it to never.  Maybe he booked Regis and Kelly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The song in the movie...  Alan Alda.  That really hurt.  He's wonderful. 
[03:28:30]  She's trying to say something.  Oh, sorry.  The movie, same time next year.  Yeah.  The song that was their theme song was,  If I knew you were coming, I'd have baked a cake, so...  So you baked a cake!  Yeah!  I get it.  It's so funny.  I hate that song.  I know.  Especially since you did bake a cake.  Why would you bake a cake if someone was coming?  You didn't even know it was Sam's birthday?  No, I didn't.  Come on, man!  All right. 
[03:29:00]  Do we have a...  Apple, cinnamon...  Raisins.  Raisins.  And sugar.  And cuties, tofu, cuties.  And cuties.  And AIDS.  I'm not going to slip.  And her IUD that fell in.  She just left it in there.  Sit down.  Fuck it.  Why not?  It's like that little rascal's cake.  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  I got a doorknob.  Well, it looks very...  Gross.  Yeah.  I know. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, it's like shit.  It's the color of a deep, dark shit.  Fudgy the cow patty.  It's not that bad.  It's awful.  It looks like Roland met the president.  It's the Edmunds turd crumb.  Not a big seller.  No.  You know, a lot of people go for their chocolate donuts, but this one is one that just didn't  get past R&D.  It's got four layers.  It looks like the baby cake of two chocolate cakes that drank during pregnancy. 
[03:30:00]  A fetal alcohol cake.  I sautéed the apples and the cinnamon and the sugar together.  That's what made it so dark, I guess.  The sautéing process.  Well, it's the cinnamon.  You do half the things right.  Like, she'll say, like, but I put it in the oven.  Yeah.  But it's like there's something missing. 
[03:30:30]  Like, you didn't put something in, like eggs or...  You know what it is?  Yeah.  Like, you missed some things.  I put in three eggs.  You put in three eggs?  Probably quail eggs or something.  But wait, wait.  Let me ask you something.  That isn't a flour-based cake, is it?  And...  Yeah, it's Bisquick.  So you went all out.  But you didn't say that.  I thought it was just ice cream.  I don't use that for cake.  No.  And raisins and apple and cinnamon.  There's actual cake.  Two layers of cake.  Made with Bisquick?  I don't think you can make Bisquick. 
[03:31:00]  You can't.  Two layers of cake, three layers of shit.  Yeah.  Bisquick is like...  It's...  You can make strawberry shortcakes out of it.  You can make coffee cake out of it.  No, you can't.  No, I can't.  Oh, I'm fascinated by her.  I don't know why.  I'm fascinated by her lack of cooking ability.  She does try.  She tries so hard, yet she stinks at it.  Well, I think that maybe I could try to do it better than the directions say.  No.  And what is it in? 
[03:31:30]  That's a Chinese food takeout thing.  I've left every single...  I've come here and I haven't been able to come on.  So I have left all of my Tupperware.  Yeah, it's not like it's empty and you have to take it home.  Like, oh, wow, everyone ate it.  We throw away the bowl, the cake, everything it came with.  Yeah.  Urinal cakes are more appetizing than that.  She's never taken home a piece of empty Tupperware from a party.  Never.  She's always got exactly...  It's got always one piece missing.  That's the one. 
[03:32:00]  The tester person tried it and warned everybody else.  So attractive, I'm so sorry.  Ixnay on the fucking cake.  Now she's licking her fingers, jabbing her thumbs into the cake and coughing all over it.  You are like Typhoid Mary with an awful cake.  I guess so.  I tried, at least.  I mean, I was brave enough to come up here.  You did try.  How do you remember to breathe?  Betty Crocked.  Betty Crocked. 
[03:32:30]  There you go.  All right.  Well, that's...  But thank you for the effort.  You're welcome.  I'm sure.  And I, you know, I really think Sam ought to at least try a piece.  I completely agree.  Yes, I think Sam should definitely have a piece.  I think Sam should try a little piece off the bottom.  You're a young boy.  Your immune system's great.  Absolutely.  Plus, what you're going to do, missing that one chromosome makes you impervious.  You're fine.  I do agree.  Sam should have a piece of the cake because I think that she puts you out. 
[03:33:00]  It's rude.  That's right.  Can I work off Rob Bartlett's thing?  Yeah.  Julia, still child.  Still born child.  Oh.  Damn it.  Damn it.  I had it.  Damn it.  I had it.  I had it.  I had it.  Oh.  Julia, still born child.  Oh.  Fuck me.  So close.  Oh, look at that.  A big bite for Samikins.  There you go, Sam.  I want to see.  Can you get the blue, please? 
[03:33:30]  What the fuck are you handing me?  Don't even think about it, fella.  Jimmy, what does it look like?  Does it look good?  It looks like you think it would look.  Oh, God.  It looks like if someone decided to make a cake out of shit and a liver.  All right.  Fast Freddy.  Don't go cutting it up.  Calling her Betty Hacker.  Just eat it up.  Sam, just throw it in there.  It's fine.  It doesn't make me get sick.  Sam, you're really going to try this? 
[03:34:00]  Pop it right in your mouth.  Yes, you should.  It's pressure.  I don't know.  Come on.  The big piece.  Ah, it's your birthday.  Get the cake.  You got to get the cakey part.  The whole piece.  What are you thinking?  It'll hurt you.  Come on.  I have a little bite.  Oh.  It's a raisin.  Try that.  It's a raisin.  Atta boy.  Healthy, Sam.  Healthy.  Sarah Leaky Bowel.  Ew, Sam is.  It's not bad, right?  You want to be bad?  Oh, you're hurting your feelings, Sam, by making those faces.  It's really good.  It's good, right?  Yeah, it's great.  Try the rest.  Why don't you finish that up?  I'm full.  You're full, right? 
[03:34:30]  I think you should have one more bite.  I just had two pieces of that ice cream cake, so I'm talking about it.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Is it very heavy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  I mean, yeah.  It's a fucking sinker.  It really is a fucking Poseidon cake.  I know.  Thank you.  I'm so trying to watch my way.  And by the way, the joke was, Randy from Manchester has it, the iron lung chef.  Oh, God.  Oh, there she goes.  Here we go.  Oh, my God. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, my God.  It is.  She's turning it into a coffee cake.  Oh, God.  Hey.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  She's hacking up.  I want to tell you.  I did it my way.  Let me shake hands.  She's hacking up batter for her next cake.  You are awful.  I'm awful.  But she means so well, you know?  Yeah.  And she's always in a good mood and happy. 
[03:35:30]  She's pure of intention.  You bake like shit.  I'm sorry.  She's a very nice girl.  She's a very nice girl.  No, don't stop.  She can actually sing.  You can really sing.  She can do.  All right.  Yeah.  What can you sing for us today?  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Tomorrow from Annie.  Hey, well, we got a Broadway star in the studio.  Go ahead.  It might get discovered here.  Right here.  The sun will come out tomorrow.  Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun. 
[03:36:00]  Just thinking about tomorrow clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow.  Till there's none.  When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely.  I just stick up my chin and grin and say, oh, the sun will come out tomorrow.  So you gotta hang on till tomorrow. 
[03:36:30]  Come what may.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  I love ya.  Tomorrow.  You're always a day away.  That was 20 years ago.  Wow.  You know what?  For an off-the-cuff thing, you know.  You gotta answer that.  That's pretty damn good.  I'm in the house.  Not only.  Rob's all tearing up.  Not only was that off-the-cuff, but she warmed up by doing heroin. 
[03:37:00]  Amazing.  Oh, that's good.  People are requesting a rock scrape.  Oh, okay.  You know how it goes?  Yeah.  You want me to play the original?  Hold on.  Just to get you warmed up.  Oh, you're not gonna be able to hear this stupid thing's not working anyway.  All right, go ahead.  All right, you're ready.  Okay, shoot.  Whew.  Oh. 
[03:37:30]  Rock Scream.  And it isn't even Rock Scream Tuesday.  That's right.  But I think we did learn a fun fact.  Yeah.  And she was, remember I told you when, oh, you gotta do it.  Could you sing, uh, Someone Left the Cake Out in the Steaming Pile of Shit?  Someone Left the Cake Out in the Steaming Pile of Shit.  Someone Left the Cake Out in the Barn. 
[03:38:00]  Glorious.  If I didn't know you were coming, I'd have shat a cake.  Uh, Big Duties, Jay, uh, Sarah, leave that cake alone.  Wow, that's good.  It's Junkie the Whale.  Big Black Negro from work.  The sun will come out tomorrow.  My cake will come out of the oven in sorrow. 
[03:38:30]  Well, you did pretty good, though, on the Annie thing.  Our love will come out tomorrow.  You did Annie when you were in school?  No, I did it last week.  Last week?  Yes, I figured.  They actually...  When you were a little kid.  Are you sad, though, that they found, Pavarotti died when they found your cake on his pancreas?  Right?  Speaking of Pavarotti, Matt from Queensbury, he writes,  I hope she takes a page out of Pavarotti's book, The Last Page.  I sing, oh, I'm not going to say it now, because you're making me sick. 
[03:39:00]  What, what, what song?  I used to sing Colortura.  Like, I used to sing opera before I started smoking.  Oh, you did?  All right, let's hear a little of that.  I mean, in honor of the Pav.  Oh, God.  Okay, oh, my gosh.  I can't believe I just said that.  Okay, I'll do the Ave Maria.  Wait, no.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Do you need water or not?  Everyone knows that one.  Please?  Let's have her some water.  Yeah, get her a little water.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, because that'll help.  Sticky.  Yeah, your hands are all sticky. 
[03:39:30]  Yuck.  Do you need some water and a 30-day treatment program?  She definitely gives us fodder, man.  Oh, my gosh.  I don't know.  Okay.  Okay, oh, I don't even know what to sing.  Um, I don't know what to sing. 
[03:40:00]  The cake is coming to life.  Oh, brava.  She can sing.  It's very, it's a little rusty, but you can still see that she's got singability. 
[03:40:30]  I do, like, Pasta Cline and Janis Joplin.  So, basically, up dead women.  The drugs they do.  That's right.  Anybody that could sing in a coma.  Water.  She needs a tracheotomy.  That's not Big Black Negro.  I can't take that one.  Very good, Big Black.  Holy shit.  Is that as bad as I thought it was?  It's worse. 
[03:41:00]  Could you sing, he ain't heavy, he got emphysema?  I don't know.  Could you sing, come on, take another little piece of my lung?  Take another little piece of my lung now, baby.  Well, you know you got it.  Child, if it makes you feel good.  Yes, indeed.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  He's like, you need a hazmat outfit to be near me, I guess.  That's not bad, it's not cough, who cares? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Oh, don't worry about that.  It's 85.  I don't care about your cough.  Laugh at it.  All right, are we ready for...  Your cough, my dick will kill your cough.  We got to give Sam his present.  Oh.  Oh, he's got a present?  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  Sam, where's your present?  It's a cock molded out of the same material that cake is made out of.  Sam's getting a lot of gifts lately.  I don't know what this is about.  Is she a special intern?  Is why he's getting all this attention?  She's, um...  I don't know what...  Sit down, Andrew.  Yeah, I don't know why Sam is so special. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, it's just...  Like, no one else gets this shit.  I was going to say, what's...  All of a sudden, he's like Mr. Special Guy.  Well, you know.  And, uh, what is that?  This is addressed to Mick Foley's friend, Sam.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait, this goes back two days.  Mick Foley's friend, Sam.  That's me.  From the WWE.  Yes.  Now, uh, of course, he was backstage with us at the Virus Tour.  PNC.  At PNC.  And then you saw him... 
[03:42:30]  Yes, and he was backstage.  There, yes.  And then you asked if you were friends.  And he said yes.  And he said yes.  So, what does that say?  So, here it is.  What does that say?  It says, happy birthday from your friends at the WWE.  Oh, your friends.  That's the secretary that signed that.  Yeah.  Well, it's not signed by Mick Foley.  It's signed by the people who we do business with in the WWE.  That's your gift?  That fucking stinks.  That does suck.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, wait a minute.  Now, there is a real gift here.  Well, this could be... 
[03:43:00]  That's your case.  This could be something.  I know what that is.  It's shaped like a giant watch.  It's a big watch, Sam.  It really is.  It's a giant watch.  It's Chris Benoit's belt.  Oh, shit.  What, the one he tied around his arm?  I believe there's a hint involved here.  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  That's like a real...  A real belt.  You know what you got to do?  You got to pry the jewels out of that and take it down and hock them.  These are the jewels from the belt.  Where are you going to find the pair of pants that's going to fit? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, the belt loops.  It spins and it's my name on it.  That is a genuine WWE championship belt.  Is it supposed to spin the W or no?  Oh, yeah.  I'm petrified that there's something nice happening.  That would be silly if it broke that way.  What?  I'm petrified that there's something nice happening right now.  Why?  Because nice things don't usually happen to you.  How heavy is that?  Well, I'm afraid that it's heavy.  Wait, you really think that's a nice gift?  Yeah, it's awesome.  Dude, for him, that is like... 
[03:44:00]  We come from different worlds, man.  I'm like, what a hunk of crap.  Is it heavy?  Yeah, it's a replica belt.  Wait, this is something that makes you very happy.  Yeah, it's got my name on it, too.  It smells good.  This is a real belt.  It was obvious with the covering that it came in.  Oh, my God.  Real leather.  That is a really nice gift.  The championship wrestling belt.  Yeah, this is the one that...  Look at that.  Who's the guy at the champ?  What's his name?  John Cena.  That's exactly what Cena would carry, but it's got... 
[03:44:30]  He did.  Cena came here and...  Yeah.  So that's something that makes you like...  Yeah.  All right.  It smells like fucking leather.  That's a nice...  Wow.  You should wear it.  I like how your name is put on there like it's really meant to be there.  I'm the champ.  It looks like something off of a dorm room door.  I'm the champ.  Hey, can I...  You're the champ, all right.  Can I see it or...  No, I'll give it to Jimmy.  Well, I've never seen one of those close-ups.  Wow, look at that.  Jimmy, can I see that or... 
[03:45:00]  I'll just...  Jimmy, can I...  Is that battery powered?  Does it spin with a battery?  Because I see something in the back.  Hold on.  Jimmy, could you pass it to me?  I've never seen a...  I don't really know if I can...  What?  I'm out of this.  I've never seen a belt up close.  Well, John Cena was in.  You saw his belt.  Well, but he was far away and...  Oh, my God.  Can I see that, Jimmy?  Sam's a good boy and it's his birthday.  That's true. 
[03:45:30]  That's why I should look at it.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I know how you do it.  Well, what I was going to say is that Sam's a good boy and it's his birthday.  But until the Sam and Than show...  It's syndicated on major markets and a major show on XM.  If the boss wants to see the belt...  He's already seen the belt.  Why is Sam sweating?  Look at his forehead.  Oh, my God.  And that is the best present anyone could have given.  Well, it spins.  It's a spinner.  I understand that.  You can smell the leather from here. 
[03:46:00]  Let me check.  I'll tell you.  But is his name spelled correctly?  You should check that out.  Oh, is it?  Why are you so nervous, man?  I'll let Ope see it.  It was a Rolling Stones pinball machine, vintage.  Yeah.  It was a couple of poker chips.  That's heavy.  Yeah.  It's really nice.  Yeah.  It's heavier than the cake, which is hard to believe.  It's very nice.  That is a...  Yeah.  Let Ope see it.  Yeah.  I'll show it to Ope after the show or something. 
[03:46:30]  Do you want to wear it, Ope?  No, but now he wants to smell it.  I sure do, Jimmy.  I sure do.  Yeah, Ope should wear it.  I don't know if he needs to wear it necessarily.  He's got a belt on already.  Eh, it doesn't fit through his belt loops.  It'll be able to...  It smells nice.  I know, leather.  Is it talking like leather?  Let me smell it.  Oh, I love the smell of new leather.  There you go, Ope.  Check it out.  Oh, wow.  It's heavy.  Ope has it.  Wow, it is heavy.  Isn't that cool?  It's all heavy and stuff.  Yeah.  It's pretty heavy. 
[03:47:00]  That actually is...  Yeah.  I'm going to tell you...  That is like a really good gift for you, isn't it?  Yes.  That means that wrestling really likes Sam.  Yes.  For real.  I'm going to hand this back to Sam because I learned something about Sam yesterday.  What's that?  That this boy knows how to keep a secret.  That's true.  I kept your secret very well.  Nobody here knew.  Hey, he showed me on the doll where he was touched.  Absolutely.  He doesn't keep a secret at all.  You missed by one hole, Ope.  Oh, my gosh. 
[03:47:30]  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  You turned a corner, man.  Didn't he?  See?  Getting engaged just turned your own.  Yep.  Trust me.  My palms were sweating.  Oh, boy, were they?  You wanted to just smash that.  That's a nice gift.  You can't smash a truly nice...  I haven't seen anybody else with one of those aside from the champ.  Well, it's got my name on it, too.  I'm the champ.  I understand.  But now, let's say you were going to a wrestling match.  Would you take that with you?  Well, yeah.  I mean, it says I'm the champ.  It's got my name on it.  So you'd take that and sit in your seat, and everybody would go, wow, why is the champ 
[03:48:00]  sitting here, and why is he so skinny?  It says WWE champ, and then it says Sam Roberts.  What are you going to do with that?  I know it's a cool gift, but really.  I'd probably walk around my house with it on.  Naked?  Probably not naked.  Naked.  That cock weighs more than the belt.  And little tighty-whities?  No.  Make-believe they're your wrestling shorts.  I'll be fully dressed, I think.  Oh, okay.  Will you wear a WWE shirt and everything? 
[03:48:30]  I'll wear the WWE shirt they sent me after I ate the steak that was fed to me.  Yeah.  You eat shitty things, and you get good gifts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See what happens?  All right.  Well, let's go home.  Friendships with people in WWE.  You're not the champ, Sam.  It says right there.  You're not the champ, Sam.  There's my name right there.  Jimmy's got to, like, hurt him.  No, no, no.  I just don't want him to get hurt.  Oh, like, him thinking he's the champ, and then he'll run into the ring?  Sam is very easily influenced, and he might walk down the street thinking he's the champ, 
[03:49:00]  and then a fist that is darker than his will crash into his nose bridge, and he'll wake  up champ-less with no belt.  No belt.  With two, like, shattered jewels in his teeth, like ring marks.  They'll identify the assailant because his ring mark will be in fucking Sam's nose bridge,  and he'll read it backwards.  I don't want to see you get ripped off.  All right.  Well, maybe when I walk around, I'll leave it in the case.  Yeah.  Hidden.  Like, the people think it's a giant watch.  Giant watch with golden jewels.  All right.  Nice gift. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  I say we gave him one fuck of a show today.  Yeah.  So, what about line of the day?  Oh.  Wow.  Well.  Wow.  The only reason you brought that up is, because we do the same thing, you think you have line  of the day.  No, I don't.  I'm trying to think.  I said nothing funny today.  Shit, no one goofed on Iraq, so it's not a shoo-in.  If you make a joke about Iraq, pfft, yeah, it's a shoo-in.  It's a shoo-in.  But, look at that, doesn't even fit, it covers up his entire front. 
[03:50:00]  Look how big that, you know what that looks like on a wrestler?  It looks like you can actually picture it of the belt on a wrestler.  That is so giant on you.  This is what it looks like on the champ.  It does, huh?  Oh, wow.  On the champ's arm.  Sam.  Yeah?  You're not a champ.  I'll leave him alone.  I beg to differ.  You look like a cigar.  He does. 
[03:50:30]  Holy shit, that's it.  You look like a cigar.  And there was your first runner-up line of the day.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Pavarotti.  Yes.  Now he's Pavarotti.  Yes.  Oh, that old gag.  That was a good one, though.  It was a great one.  Sam, stop admiring the belt.  Yeah, what are you doing?  It's getting a little cool.  Sam's going to do this naked.  It was cool, but now it's getting creepy.  Look at his cock just to the right of the, um, the, uh, look at, look at, look at, it's 
[03:51:00]  hanging down like a fucking meatloaf.  Could you, could you spin the W and go, come on, thousand, come on, thousand?  Yeah.  Your cock is making that belt look dizzy.  Yeah, like, the belt pushed your cock down.  What are you packing, Sam?  Are you like a seven and a half, man?  I don't know.  Don't lie.  I don't know.  No, I'm sure it's at least nine, ten pounds.  Yeah, it's gotta be.  No, roughly.  Would you say you're a seven and a half or are we completely off?  Yeah, it wouldn't be completely off.  Are we falling short or are we giving you a little too much credit?  Do you, do you pass the two fist test? 
[03:51:30]  Mm.  Yeah.  Sure, I look, I'm heavy with my belt.  This is what I'm thinking about right now.  Sam's got six.  Don't make us call your mommy.  Like the fact that we think he has a giant cock.  Well, you can see it.  It's right there.  Yeah.  It's just to the right.  It's leaning just to the right.  Right below the belt.  See Sam's cock?  Wait, Sam, do this.  It's right there.  Yeah.  Sam, do this.  Put, put your legs together and put, thrust your hips out and put your arms over  like, ah.  See, there it is.  Jimmy, go over there and point out his cock for everybody. 
[03:52:00]  Point out his cock.  Go smell the belt now, Jimmy.  Yeah, give it a good sniff.  I don't even know if that's his dick or that's his jeans.  It's probably jeans.  I don't know.  It'd be a nut.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  When you're making that, do you think it's going to be good?  Like, do you?  I didn't know it was going to be this color.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How many parents have said that one?  They see that daughter's son.  Yes, Jimmy Norton. 
[03:52:30]  Very good.  That was a funny one.  I hope that big W falls off.  I hope you spin it around and it rolls right out of that thing and you've got to chase it.  Like, chase it down the street.  It always goes upside down.  It just looks like an M.  No one knows what it means.  He's the champion.  Moron.  You have to polish it so it don't get tarnished.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  Mike from Minnesota brings up a very good point.  Champs don't eat gummy cola bottles. 
[03:53:00]  I'm reinventing the game.  Yeah.  He's reinventing the game.  I see.  Those stupid belts are like 400 bucks.  Wow.  Nice gift.  That is pretty good.  You're going to sell it?  I'm the champ.  Somebody's going to have to beat me if they want to get this belt.  Oh, here goes Stan.  He's taking the belt and cashing it in.  I'm not defending it right now.  For the rip-off iPhones you sold us.  I told you to put the dishes in it, I'm going to fall.  He got me a good deal on an iPhone.  I could have paid 300 less for it. 
[03:53:30]  If you waited until today, right?  Price dropped today, was it?  Yeah, I think so.  Whatever.  Let's do your line of the day.  Oh, here it comes.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  And we're off.  It's exciting.  He smelled good, right?  Yeah.  What did he smell like?  Like deliciousness?  Shut up. 
[03:54:00]  There it is.  He smelt like deliciousness.  Roland's comments on President Bill Clinton.  Is it overkill to play Roland doing Pavarotti?  No.  Did you ever meet Clinton, Rob?  Are you kidding?  No.  Did you ever talk to him on the phone?  No.  When Imus was talking to him?  No.  All right.  I mean, I was there when he did, but I didn't hear him.  All right.  You weren't listening?  I was listening, but I wasn't there, actually.  I mean, I heard him like everyone else heard him.  Yeah.  Rob?  Yeah.  September 15th, Rob Bartlett.  Very funny guy, obviously. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Imus' radio show.  Does Brian Wilson and Bill Clinton.  And then many, many others.  The Beatles.  The Beatles.  He's a great stand-up.  He'll be playing the Comedy Connection September 15th in Saugus, Massachusetts.  Yeah.  And October 6th, St. John's University.  Sorry.  St. John's University.  In Oakdale, Long Island.  Anything else, Rob?  Oakdale.  No.  It's pretty much it.  When's the show start?  Oh, no.  We've been doing the show the whole time. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, okay.  And tomorrow, someone's going to challenge Sam for the belt.  For the championship belt.  That belt is now up for grabs.  You said someone's going to have to beat you for it.  That's right.  The champion only has to defend his belt once every 30 days.  So...  All right.  I don't see why I have to defend it tomorrow.  That's one day.  There have been some champs that have had the belt for one day, haven't there?  Yeah.  But this isn't one of them.  Well, you're going to have to defend it.  I don't know if I'll have to have a... 
[03:55:30]  Can we make up your wrestling character?  Of course.  All right.  Good.  We'll get his wrestling character.  He's the champ.  Right now, he's the champ.  And then someone's going to have to, like, beat him and take it.  Wait.  Because that'll upset him so much.  He's the cockinator.  Is this Senator Craig about to resign?  He hasn't decided yet.  Okay.  Forget it.  Keeps changing his mind.  Yeah.  Just like his sexuality.  In that bathroom.  You know what?  How is there any gray area?  You either...  Suck the cock.  You can say it. 
[03:56:00]  We're on XM.  That's right.  You either take the balls to the face, you don't.  Right.  Well, I'll tell you.  All right, Jimmy.  All right.  Listen.  What do you think there's a gray area there?  Roland sings Pavarotti in honor of the passing of Pavarotti.  Yes.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  And keep in mind.  What, Jimmy?  What?  Just keep in mind.  I just wanted the floor for a second.  And then I panicked.  Yes.  You've got to do Pavarotti proud today. 
[03:56:30]  I will.  All right.  Now, do you know where to come in?  Sure.  All right.  Here we go.  I can do it.  Roland doing Pavarotti.  It's a little musical.  Oh, one more wiggle. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, God.  Maria, Maria, gratia paria, ave, ave, dominus, dominus tecum benita tu inmoversia, et tu benedicia, et tu fructus ventris, ventris. 
[03:57:30]  To Jesus, ave Maria, ave Maria, matade ora por nobis, pretrobius, ora por nobis, ora, ora pro nobis, pretrobius? 
[03:58:00]  Ave Maria, nux et in hora mortris, et in hora mortris, nustra, et in hora mortris, et in hora mortris, 
[03:58:30]  matade seleccion juror!  Oh my God.  Wow. 
[03:59:00]  You think he'll get an 11 minute standing ovation?  Bravo.  Bravo, bravo, bravo, el fatso, el fatso.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous.  I need to be a shock jock.  Always up to no good. 
[03:59:30]  I laughed so hard I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is like the number one show in the world. </pre>
