<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of a poker tournament at Foxwoods Casino involving the hosts, staff (Patrice, E-Rock, Danny, Jimmy, Roland, and Troy), and over 200 fans.  Danny was the first eliminated, followed by Roland, E-Rock, Jimmy, Troy, and Anthony, with Patrice lasting the longest.  Humorous anecdotes were shared about Patrice’s poker strategy and Troy’s inattentiveness. The staff largely left before the tournament ended, missing the winner’s split pot. Anthony then detailed his experiences at the blackjack tables, describing aggressive betting, generous tipping, and several confrontations with casino staff.  A caller, Pete, shared a similar gambling experience.  The conversation shifted to the NFL, focusing on the Giants’ disappointing loss and the Jets’ narrow win, along with a New York newspaper's controversial front page featuring photoshopped images of dogs on the Giants players’ faces next to Michael Vick, sparking a discussion about Vick’s past and his desire to own another dog.  The segment concluded with a planned interview with musician "Homeless Mustard," briefly delayed by an unexplained issue with his "entourage."  The interview covered Mustard's life, sobriety, the unexpected success of his EP (especially in Russia), his halfway house living situation, a recent trip to Washington D.C. with fellow residents, and his physical problems, including severely damaged feet requiring steroid injections. He also discussed meeting his producer, Hap Pardo, through Rich Brownstein.  Callers inquired about booking Mustard for a bachelor party and an orthotist offered custom orthotics.  The conversation also touched upon American Idol, America’s Got Talent, conspiracies, Charles Barkley's comments on Brett Favre, Mustard's fictional family, and concluded with playing two songs from his EP, "One Day at a Time" and "Impulse," with producers Hap Pardo and Jimmy briefly joining the conversation.

The next segment focused on viral internet videos.  The hosts discussed a video of Ron "Fez" Bennington dressed as "baby Hitler," and Fez explained his reasoning.  The discussion then centered on Andy Samberg's SNL digital short "I Just Had Sex," detailing its explicit lyrics featuring repeated use of the word "penis," with caller Grant defending it as satire.  The hosts compared it to other SNL digital shorts.  Another viral video, "Father Christmas Fucked My Pussy," featuring a performer in drag, was discussed, with the hosts speculating on the performer's identity and reacting with varying degrees of amusement and disgust. The show then played Ben Lerman's song "My Name is Ben Lerman, I Play the Ukulele," and the hosts struggled to find the official video.  Australian comedian James Smith then arrived in studio.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Australian culture, including a viral video of a rugby player and a dog, and playing a Christmas song by Kevin Bloody Wilson, followed by further discussion of Smith's career and touring experiences.


The segment with James Smith continued with jokes about American men in Australia and a discussion of Australian slang. Smith recounted his experience in the World Debating Championships and connected his debating background to stand-up comedy. He detailed his positive experience performing on a John Mayer cruise, but also discussed the less glamorous aspects of cruise ship comedy, including stories of comedians being "dropped off" in undesirable locations for poor performances.  A caller, Brad, shared a story about a comedian, Vince Champion, who was allegedly a serial rapist and subsequently convicted.  This led to a discussion about the criminal justice system in the US and Australia.  The conversation returned to Smith’s experiences, including cultural differences between the US and Australia, specifically regarding dating and marriage, and a controversial blackface skit from "Hey Hey It's Saturday." The segment concluded with promotional information for Smith's New Year's Eve show and Opie's upcoming television appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  Fun dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest  The show is a lot funnier  On any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  Here  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me 
[00:00:30]  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show  I'm gonna go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  Yeah, we just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  You just laughed off of the watching radio duo  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Let's  And yes, we are live  A lot of people wondering if we were gonna be live this week 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, we'll do a couple days, maybe three  We'll phone in some shows for you  I think we're scheduled to do three  Maybe we should do two  Three? We might just do two  Who the hell knows?  I think we should do two  And get the hell out of here  And call it a year  Hell out of here  I noticed traffic a little lighter this morning  I think a lot of people are taking the week  You know what I mean?  They kinda take the week of Christmas off  So it was lighter  But wow, I'm glad I wasn't on that eastbound side of the expressway 
[00:01:30]  I come up and I heard the traffic report say there was an accident eastbound  So of course I got the rubbernecking and shit  But it wasn't that bad  And I looked over and it looked like a pretty bad crash  Oh boy  And traffic backed up for like a mile  And then right when it started opening up for the other side  There was a fresh new accident  It had to be six cars and a couple of taxi cabs  Just strewn on the expressway 
[00:02:00]  Like all turned in the wrong direction  And slid into the barrier  And then behind that, another whole wave of traffic  So something happened  Is it icy on the road or something?  Not icy at all, bone dry  Bone dry  But wow  Imagine you get through that first one  And you're like, ah  And then you're just on the brakes  And then you see the brake lights again  The worst thing about being in traffic like that  Is when you have no idea what the hell is going on up there 
[00:02:30]  It could be 500 feet away from you  It could be five miles  You never know  It could be completely blocked  It could be rubbernecking  And that's the beauty of that  And then when you're going down the other way  You know  Right  So you're like, oh I know  You're going to be in that for a while  And you want to tell everybody somehow  You want to kind of be like, hey  Oh, you're fucked  But you're trying to say something  As you're going 70 miles an hour  Yeah  It's like, hey  I'm driving  They sort of pick up this  Yeah, yeah  Get the fuck  You're pretty fucked 
[00:03:00]  They don't even get the fuck part  No, no  Yeah, I felt bad for them  But it wasn't me  So fuck them  So how was the poker, boys?  What a pisser  What a blast  Foxwoods treated you guys well  Yeah  You're great  You're going to love it  Had a great time  Was sitting next to Patrice  Patrice  I saw the pictures  For the entire game  Very good  Patrice very quickly learning that poker  Not what he was saying it was  Not all luck like he was saying 
[00:03:30]  He's sitting there going  What the fuck  Like his first inkling was when  Somebody raised him  And he didn't want to  Put in for the raise  With the cards he had  So he goes  I'm folding  And the other guy said  Alright  And he pushed his cards in  Patrice goes  Wait, what did you have?  The guy goes  I don't have to show you  And Patrice is like  Wait, what?  I said  No, Patrice  He doesn't have to show you  I go  That's part of the game  Like he could have nothing  Or he could have really good cards  But his bet  Made you decide  What you're going to do 
[00:04:00]  And not his cards  So it  And then he started thinking like  Oh, man  So the betting is a part of the game  Motherfucker  Like he started realizing  It's not all just  I have good cards  I'm going to win this hand  I predict Patrice will win  The World Series of Poker  Within the next five years  Yes, absolutely  Well, he's dressed for it  Yeah, he certainly is  He's got that kind of  Real  I don't know  Stylish dress  He was wearing that fedora  He had the plaid pants  The jacket on  He was looking very snazzy  Very sporty 
[00:04:30]  I predict Patrice will lose  Everything playing poker  I think Patrice is going to lose  Everything  How much for the hat?  Yeah, yeah  Let me throw my hat in  That's tough to do with poker though  Because you don't really have to  Put a lot in to begin with  Oh, you could lose a lot though  Cash games  You could get in big tournaments  You think this will be his thing?  Yeah, I think he kind of got the bug  I think he enjoyed it  He had a good time  He started  When he raked in a few hands  He was feeling good  You could tell 
[00:05:00]  Like at first  You know, he was bleeding some chips  Because he really didn't get the hang of it  Now he's looking over  And seeing the way I play  I'm folding, folding, folding  A lot of hands  And he's like  You know, you're playing a lot  And I go, yeah  That's part of the game  You can't  I wasn't going to play every hand  He didn't know that part either  And then he was to my right  So he would bet  And I would just come over the top of him  And he's like  Motherfucker  You can't just bet the same thing  I'm like, no  I got a hand  I want to raise  And so he got one of those quick educations 
[00:05:30]  He was actually in longer than I was  Well  I got knocked out  Well, who played on staff?  I want to know who got knocked out early  E-Rock  Who was the first one out?  Well, who played?  E-Rock, Danny, Jimmy, Patrice, and Ant?  Is that it?  E-Rock  Troy  Troy  Danny  Roland  Roland  Patrice, Ant, Jim  The first person eliminated  Was, in fact  Danny  Danny was first out  Danny knows how to play a little poker, right?  Yeah  That was a huge shock  It doesn't happen  I mean, it happens, though 
[00:06:00]  You know, it's  You go all in on a hand you think is going to win  You can fuck  I should have dropped out of more hands  Really?  You were just playing a lot?  Yeah, I stayed too long  Like  Because it wasn't my money  It's like  You don't think as much  Oh, so when someone raises  You're just going  Oh, maybe I'll get lucky  I want a little pussy  I'm like, ah  400 bag of shells  And I'm like  I knew I had a 6  And a high card 9  Oh my god  Offsuit  Oh, dude  A little offsuit action  I was terrible  And that, you know  Occasionally you'll hit that 
[00:06:30]  But for the most part  Yeah, you should back out  Fold  Because, you know  You can't lose the money  Unless you put it in  So if you just, you know  Don't bet that  And fold  You won't look like a pussy  It's part of the game  I know, but I kept saying  I'm looking for the royal flush  I was looking for the royal flush  I had a king of clubs  I'm like  Royal flush  It's easy just to play  With somebody else's money, too  It goes a lot faster, right?  Yeah, yeah  So Danny was the first one out?  First one out  How many people were in the tournament?  How many fans?  Well over 100 
[00:07:00]  And they were all from the show?  Okay, about 200  All from the show?  Or did they let some civilians in?  No, they were like all  Civilians meaning outside the ONA community  A lot of fans  Okay  I mean for the majority of them  There were a few I think  That just like  Was like  Hey, what's this?  Tournament?  Yeah  Snuck in a little bit  Yeah, they paid in  Sat down with their glasses  And headphones  And wouldn't look at anybody  Yeah, yeah  Those guys  Oh, those guys  Were the fucking regulars, man  Yeah, yeah  Did any of them win?  Vultures  No  No  No, they didn't win?  Who was the big winner?  Well, no, don't get there 
[00:07:30]  Troy  Was next out?  No, he wasn't next out  He actually lasted longer than he should have  Because he didn't know how to play at all  Except he  Somehow he lasted  But everybody at his table was getting pissed at him  Because he kept not paying attention  And then asking the dealer what the rules are  Oh my god  Oh god  Like he didn't know it was his turn to bed  He was just, you know, talking to the girl  Who was sitting next to him  Oh, Jesus  Even though her husband was at the table across from him  You like those type of players, right, Ant? 
[00:08:00]  Sometimes, yeah, yeah  A lot of fun  A lot of fun to mess with  Yeah, yeah  So who was second out as far as the crew goes?  Second out  I think, was it Iraq?  Roland?  Roland was second  Roland  Hello  How was his play?  His was much better than he expected  And he told me that he was bummed out  Because he was planning on just going all in  And then getting out early  So he could go to the bar  And he actually lasted like an hour  Roland wants to drink  Roland won 15 hands in a row  He said he just wanted to go to Fuddruckers 
[00:08:30]  Roland's a  I think Roland's one of those sneaky drinkers  Is he?  I think he drinks more than we realize  Please  I know he does  Oh, you saw it?  He loves drinking  You saw it?  Yeah  I've never really seen the Roland  I saw it up until the point  I was so fucked up  So Roland and then Iraq  Yeah, and then  Yeah  And then Iraq  And then  Jim  And then Troy  And then Ant  And then Patrice  So Patrice was number one in the crew 
[00:09:00]  Oh yeah  Lasted the longest  Yep  How much longer did he last after you went?  I don't know  I ran away to the blackjack table  Pretty quick  Yeah  What was it?  15  Like 15 minutes?  Oh, so a couple more hands  The blinds were going up really fast  Because it was turbo games  So, I mean, they kept doubling the blinds  So if you were short stacked  You had to push all in  Like with marginal hands  Or else you were just going to be blinded out  How long did the tournament take?  Well, the tournament itself took a while  I mean, it took about three hours for everybody on staff to get knocked out 
[00:09:30]  Yeah  Well, when you were out, Ant  How many more people were left?  I looked around and there were a lot of empty seats  There's probably three tables left  Three tables left  Of ten?  Not even  Some of the seats were empty  Yeah  Oh, so like  We don't know who the winner is  Huh?  We don't know who the winner is  We all left early  Yeah, we all just like boogied on away from the tournament  You can't even hang around  I saw some of the winner of the ONA Poker Tournament  I saw some black jacks  No one knows who won 
[00:10:00]  I saw the guy's tweet who won  He won like $2,400 or something  He chopped it  I think two guys decided they were just going to chop it  I read that tweet as well  That means you just split  They split the pot  Split the pot  But that was like two hours after Patrice was gone  We had to go get there  But don't you think someone from the ONA staff should have been there for the winner of the ONA Poker Tournament?  At first, it was like, yeah, why don't you stick around  And maybe, yeah, Sam, you should get some audio from the winner  And I was like, yeah, I'm going to probably go get some dinner and then come back  I'm out  Management  Management was there 
[00:10:30]  We all disappeared and ditched them  And then they even gave up and left  Anthony stumbled off to go gamble  And Patrice left  I love how he says stumbled  Stumbled, yes  He couldn't say just walk off  He had to say stumbled  That was a little shot at you  Yeah, that's fine  A little shot  It was actually an accuracy  And then Danny and Roland followed to go drink  And then everyone else was like, well, let's just go do something else or get something to eat  And left Gary sitting there for the whole time  Yeah  No, and then Gary, they and Gary and Rob were just like 
[00:11:00]  I was texting back and forth  I was like, do I really need to come back?  And they were like, yeah, we're  We're going to leave too  Then it just became a tournament  It just became a tournament  Right  Like it's any tournament  And then, you know, they know how to play  And the people at Foxwoods know how to run it  So  I had Blackjack to play  But it was your poker tournament  You should have been there with your arm around the winner  Maybe a big pile of chips in front of the winner  I'd rather  Oh, shit  Maybe a big, large check  I'd be given the winner of the ONA  A giant check  Not even the ONA  The Anthony Cuvia poker tournament 
[00:11:30]  No, at that point it became the Anthony Cuvia drunken blackjack extravaganza  In the high stakes area  You can't change it  Foxwoods was very cool  They opened up a table for me  That I had, like, a high limit  But then they let other people play  Like listeners play  Whatever they wanted  So they could bet ten bucks  Do they fuck up your cards?  No, they knew how to play  You're not a fan of that  They knew not to sit down and really fuck things up  I was the one, like, making some wacky moves  Did Patrice play with you?  Because we all left at the same time 
[00:12:00]  No, Patrice  Danny called him  And he was at a bar  Oh, he did, okay  He was at one of the bars  Just hanging out  And then Danny called him  And told him where we were  But he kind of disappeared  I forgot to call him  Because I said I was going to text Patrice  I said we're all going to leave together  Because we leave night  Me and Kay left night of  But when we got  I just forgot  And then we got outside  And Kenny's tire was flat  Oh, God  So it was like  I just  I totally forgot to  You're getting a lot of flat tires  A lot of flat  I know  I went through that phase for a while  That's at least three or four, man  That's six  That's six? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I just had one two weeks ago  What was  Was the screw in this tire?  Yeah, it was a screw  But thank God  Foxwoods has, like, a maintenance truck  They have a tow truck  And they called the guy  He was there in, like, two minutes  But the thing is  He's, like, a little slight guy  And he, like  He couldn't get, like, the lug nuts off  The tire was too heavy  He couldn't even, like, get the plug in  Why would they have that guy?  I don't know  I guess nobody wants that shitty job  I don't know  As far as casino jobs go  That one's pretty bad  Yeah, you're a tire guy 
[00:13:00]  Yeah  So it's like  I had to, like, help him a little bit  Or we never would have got out of there  Oh, yeah  But thank God  They had a guy there  That could, like, plug the tire  And we got out of there  Yeah, that's great  Coat truck in two minutes  How bummed were you when you walked up to the truck  And saw a flat tire?  Oh, yeah, because I thought  You know, you've got to wait, like, an hour for AAA  Sure, yeah  You know, and I was tired  You know, we've got a two-and-a-half-hour drive home  And I just wanted to get out of there  I should have been waiting for AA  See, Alcoholics Anonymous 
[00:13:30]  I didn't even get that  Yeah  I'll tell you, though  At the poker tournament  They only had, like, two waiters  Working the whole tournament  Because Connecticut  There's a law  You can't back up drinks  Right  So, like, you know  And our fans  They like to drink  They want to back up their drinks  Yes, they do  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But it was all about me  Oh, yeah  I made sure  I took care of the waiter  I tipped him very well  And he had my drink there  Right when the other one was empty 
[00:14:00]  He rocked it  That's what the big buzz around the tournament was  That Ant kept throwing 20s  Every time the guy would bring a drink  So one waiter stayed near Anthony  And then the other waiter  Had to take care of 200 people  Yeah, exactly  I was bogarting the waiter  We know whose waiter was busier  At the end, after Ant was out  And he was about to go to the blackjack table  I tried to interview him  And he instead took the recorder out of my hand  And he threw it  Oh, that's good 
[00:14:30]  And launched it into a fan's head  Yes, exactly  I didn't want to speak to you  I had blackjack  Once again, this was your poker tournament, sir  Yes  Anthony was fucking steaming for a couple of minutes  Oh, God, was I  I was  Motherfucker  What, you were mad when you got knocked out?  Yes, of course I was  What took you out?  Better cards  No, but did you have a pretty good hand?  Or you were bluffing?  What were you doing?  I was getting a little  What was your move?  I was getting a little short-stacked  And the blinds were getting high  So you had no real choice  I had enough  But I needed some help from the fucking flop 
[00:15:00]  And I really didn't get it  So it was that  Oh, wait, you can get help from those four cards?  Oh, yeah  That was a ledge  Five cards  I wouldn't know  Oh, really?  Nothing  If I didn't have a pair in my hand  I could just go fuck my mother with a stick  I don't know how people do that all night  It was like  The casino was great  But I literally was just getting annoyed  I'm like, why would I have anything?  Seven of clubs  Two of diamonds  Fucking Duvall threw better matching cards on bodies 
[00:15:30]  Apocalypse Now  It was terrible  Yeah  You were just getting a bad run of cards  I dropped out of the first hand I was on  And I would have won with a pair of fives  And the only hand I won was a pair of nines  Why?  Did someone raise you on that pair of fives?  Is that why you didn't stay in?  No, I just thought there's no way I could win with a pair of fives  Oh, and I won with a high card  Ace  You won with an ace  You stayed in  Yeah, high card  Was everyone checking?  Yeah  Check, check, check  Checking their asses off  Check, check, check  I like that too with new players  When a bet comes down 
[00:16:00]  And it's their turn to bet  Like Patrice  And he's looking and goes  I want to check  It's like  Nah, see, someone bet  So you gotta bet  I can't check  Nah  You gotta at least match that bet right there  You gotta at least match the bet or raise  One time Jimmy went all in  And then all the staff members had like a secret envelope prize  Right, it was the bounty  Right  What was in that?  Right  A night at MGM Grand  Oh, really?  Yeah  Wow  I think there were assorted prizes  Because I saw Jimmy had a Steven Singer jeweler  Oh, I think 
[00:16:30]  Oh, did I have something from Steven Singer?  Yeah  So he kept it  Yeah  So if you knocked out one of the boys  You got a little secret prize  Yeah  You got the envelope  A little bonus  Yeah, that was fun  That's cool  Sounds like you guys had a really good time  It was unbelievable, man  It was fun  And then blackjack  Playing with the listeners  Was just ridiculous  And again  The listeners will keep getting me beers  Like they just kept frigging getting me beers  And uh  Wow  And all I was drinking was beer  But it's amazing  What gallons of beer can do 
[00:17:00]  I was just an obnoxious  Sitting at that table  Just worse than Pesci with that blackjack dealer  I was just like  Look at your cards, you fuck  Look at what you're giving me  And they're like  Oh, you can't use that language  You can't use that language  The dealer was saying that?  Yeah, yeah  Why can't they have four dealers?  They can handle that shit  Like, yeah, that figures  That figures  And then some woman at another table  Turned and gave me like a  Ugh  Ugh  Look at me  And I just went  What the fuck are you looking at? 
[00:17:30]  What the fuck are you looking at?  Do you know who I am?  You didn't do that  Oh, I did  And the listeners were just laughing  I was doing it also  You're playing up to them  Yeah, the listeners were laughing their balls off  Sitting there watching that shit  What kind of action was she playing?  Oh, nothing  Believe me, if I was playing anything but high stakes  I would have been let out like that guy  That put his feet up on the table in Casino  I opened the door with his fucking head  That would have been me  Did you want him doing well or no?  Yes, I did well 
[00:18:00]  Oh, good  I did well  Didn't even know I did well  To tell you the truth  Because how many times I was yelling  Marker, marker, marker  But Keith is very sneaky  Keith will  As I'm playing  He looks over  He will grab a stack of my chips  Go to the cage  Pay off a marker  Pay off a marker  Was he fucking Ginger from Casino?  Putting him in his purse  I catch him and he puts his lipstick on  Worst cover ever  So when all was said and done  I was like, wow, you know 
[00:18:30]  I think I got Marcus payoff  He goes, no, you're up  Nice  You're up  Good for you  That was good  I had a great time  So why can't they have a cool dealer  That can handle salty language?  Well, Keith was suggesting  That next time we just have  Either big black men dealers  Or old white guy dealers  No women and no Asians  Because they really can't take the abuse  But why can't they have a table  Where it's obvious  The dealer could deal with anything  Like the smoking table  And then the fuck you table 
[00:19:00]  The obnoxious  You can have a fuck you cunt table  And shit like that  The obnoxious player table  Whatever you want to call it  I would like that  Why do you have to like  Why do you have to have manners at a casino?

[00:19:30]  And I tip like a motherfucker  Like I'm tipping like a motherfucker  Because I'm betting like five G's a hand  Jesus  And like I'd double down  And I'd hit  And then I'd toss the dealer a few hundred, you know?  So they should be able to put up with my shit  And I think that's why I actually remain seated there  Because I think I would have been, you know, long gone  They don't put up with that shit at the $10 table  You're tipping the dealer a few hundred here and there  And they get pissed  And the dealer's still getting mad at you? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, yeah  Oh, go fuck yourself  I know, I know  Well, right there  You should have like knocked back your tipping  Really?

[00:23:30]  Only kudos there to Foxwoods  How are you going to make  An hour special out of this?  I know  You're walking around  With a recording device?  Yeah, I've got like  Five and a half hours of audio  To go through  To make this special  Oh, fuck  I left a recorder  On Patrice and Ann's table  The entire time  Oh, fuck  And then there was one point  Because we were  I think  We started drinking  On the way  Off  In the limo  And  So by the time  We got there  We had kind of a buzz on  So then by the time 
[00:24:00]  Danny got knocked out  You're supposed to say  Something to the people  So it's like  Oh, the next person  That got knocked out  Was Danny Ross  So some people  Were applauding  And other people  Were like  Boo  Boo  Because, you know  Danny has his haters  And Danny just like  You know  Had a few beers  He gets on the mic  He goes  Anyone don't fucking like me  Just come up  And tell me to my face  Did anyone take him up on it?  No, why would they?  Of course not  Why would they?  They just get online  Yeah  Tape, tape, tape  They'll run back 
[00:24:30]  To their basements  Yes, exactly  You're not saying a word  I can't wait to get home  To actually tell them  How I feel  No one comes up to anybody  That's that  Iraq  I was at the table  Next to Danny  When he was playing  And when he got eliminated  He didn't even yell or anything  He just growled  Real loud  He stood up and went  Just like  Looked at everybody  And then walked away  Yeah  That poker can do that shit to you, man  You just get like  Yeah  It's humiliating  To get knocked out  Yeah  You gotta kind of 
[00:25:00]  Just get up  Get out of your chair  Leave  Leave the table, please  You are no longer welcome here  You can't play with us anymore  See?  See this?  You know what it means?  Not welcome  American History X  Yes  Very good  We got no interns today  We don't have interns  What?  No  Their semester's over  Oh, is it?  Yeah  For a while  Yeah  Next one, too  Semester's over  For a couple of semesters  Yeah  I've said  Yep  All right 
[00:25:30]  Yeah  It was great, though  Good times  Good times  Good times  Fucking football yesterday  Anybody?  Anybody watch these games?  I didn't get to watch  I forgot it existed  Until I was at the cell  I was at the cell  Is it?  Yeah  No, I wasn't  Until I was out to dinner  And I saw on the bar TV  That there was a game going  Allegedly  Allegedly  I hear  I know the Jets won  Yes  And I know the Giants  Just fucking self-destructed  The Giants game  Was un-fucking-believable  What did they end up scoring?  Four touchdowns 
[00:26:00]  The Eagles  In less than eight minutes  In the fourth quarter  And that's that punt return  By Sean Jackson  That's that shit  That just doesn't happen  But the punter  Was supposed to  Fucking punt it out of bounds  Oops  Coughlin said  Coughlin goes  I told him  To punt it out of bounds  But supposedly  He got a high snap  Or something  So he decided  To fucking kick it  Yeah  Because he was panicking  And the Sean fucking Jackson  Just shoved it  Right up their asses  Holy shit  How the fuck 
[00:26:30]  It's got to be  The biggest collapse  In Giants history  I don't know if that's  Up by three touchdowns  With eight minutes remaining  And in full control  Of their destiny  And the NFC East  The Giants threw it  All the way Sunday  With one of the most  Humiliating collapses  In the 85 year history  Of the franchise  Four unanswered touchdowns  To the Eagles  Oof  It was unbelievable  To watch  And then of course  Deshaun with a 65 yard  Punt return  With no time on the clock  Unbelievable  In front of a hometown crowd  For the Giants 
[00:27:00]  Yeah  Yeah  They just  Just shutting everyone up  Completely folded  And then the Jets  Squeaked by  With the Steelers  Yesterday  Was that true?  That was the first  Game winning punt return  Ever?  Yeah  In history?  Yeah  Something like that  Fuck  Yeah  Because usually  You kind of fucking  Just punt it out of bounds  Yeah  You don't  You kind of  You don't give them  A chance like that  You don't give them  A chance to run it back  Like that  Dummies  How much time  Is on the clock?  Not much  I'm going to guess 
[00:27:30]  I don't know  Like 20 seconds maybe  Oh god  Why would you  Yeah then  Why would you  Even give them  A chance?  Yeah  I don't know  Exactly how many seconds  But not much at all  All they had to do  Was fucking punt it  Out of bounds  Yeah  Someone fucked up  This idiot  Fucking  He screwed the pooch  Screwed the pooch  Making Michael Vick  Look like a fucking animal  Yeah  This Vick is having  A hell of a year  So  Don't say animal  And him in the same sentence  I get very offended  I was watching  I love that  What about your Jets? 
[00:28:00]  Well the Jets  My Jets  I bleed Jack Green  You sure do  Yeah  What a victory  Squeaking one out again  Yeah  I had the Jets  And six  Yeah  Well you know  I think  I think they're  Playoff bound  Yeah  Well not necessarily  I just think  We've still got  A couple things to do  I think they are  Jets looking a little shaky  Yeah  A little shaky  We scored our first  Offensive touchdown  I think they'll  Squeak by Sanchez 
[00:28:30]  We scored our first  Offensive touchdown  Since Thanksgiving  Yesterday  Think about that  Alright Mr. Hand  I think you'll  Squeak by  Mr. Sanchez  Yeah  He  Pulled it off  What are you gonna do?  And then  Roethlisberger  Fucking  Marches down the field  Did he march?  He pretty much marched  I think he went  92  Just about 92 yards  Last play of the game  And kind of a little  Tip action in the end zone 
[00:29:00]  And the Jets win  Could have easily  Been a loss for the Jets  Yesterday  Holy shit  Of course  That's like every other  Game they played  Except for the ones  They lost  Right  Could have easily  Been a loss  I don't know man  Whatever  You know  We're hanging in there  The Jets  Take the W  No matter what the  Fuck happened  It's a win  Sure  A win's a win  Sure  That's what I like to say  A win's a win  Hey the Patriots  Win last night  I really don't know  I'm not rubbing it in  If they lost  I have no fucking idea  That was the late game 
[00:29:30]  I didn't hear anything  Oh it was the late game  Yeah  Yeah they won  They won  31-27  Okay  I love making it sound  Like I knew what I was  Talking about  When I'm just  Reading off of people  They could put anything  There and I'd be like  Maybe they lost  But I'm just reading  I was watching  ESPN Classic  Which is  It's fucking great  Oh wait wait wait wait  Yes yes yes yes  Someone just reminded me  That the front page  Of the New York papers  Are hilarious  The one says 
[00:30:00]  Giants dog it  And they got  They photoshopped  Pictures of dogs  They're insane  With Michael Vick  They got Michael Vick  On the front page  Of the New York paper today  And the Giants  Have dog faces  Actual dogs  As faces  On the front page  Very controversial  But they had the opportunity  To do it with  Plausible deniability  As far as  That whole Michael Vick  Was this conscious  Controversial  Well that picture  Is a little controversial  Right  You know  Michael Vick  Dogs  And remember last week  When Patrice was in 
[00:30:30]  We all were talking about  How Michael Vick  Is itching  Yeah  He's itching  You know that  A mere  Like four hours later  It came out  That he wants to  Get another dog  He wants a doggy  We nailed that one too  He's a dog lover  He said  Yeah he wants another dog  He wants a dog  But part of the whole thing  With his conviction  Was he can't  He can't own another dog  Right  That's it  Then why doesn't he  Just let it go  Just leave it alone  It's like you got  You went to jail  You're now playing  In the NFL  He wants it  Just let it go  Can he get a cat  Get a big cat 
[00:31:00]  I think the reason  He can't let it go  Is because  If he gets a dog  And treats it right  That will help his image  Maybe yeah  If he's walking around  With a nice little dog  On a leash  Treating it like  A fucking superstar  How could you hate him anymore  He should get one of those  Little Paris Hilton ones  Sure  Just carry it around  In a bag  Right now everyone's wondering  If he gets close to the dog  Will he choke it  Yeah  But if he gets to have another dog  Then he could change all that around  But what if he gets a dog  And tragically  It has like some kind of  Congenital heart problem 
[00:31:30]  And dies  Like just naturally  That happens  He takes it to the vet  The vet comes out  And goes  Mr. Vic  I'm sorry  The dog expired  He'd be like  I want a full autopsy on that  I want the report  Fucking delivered to the press  I don't care what this costs  I want you to make sure  Everyone knows  I was not responsible for this  Or what if he has to put  His own dog down  And he goes to the vet  And goes  I'll do it for you  Yeah  Don't worry I got this  For all time's sake  Where's your neck snapper  Right  You have a professional neck snapper  You get a bucket  Some water 
[00:32:00]  I'll take care of this  That's probably what he does  When he's not playing football  Monday and Tuesday  Volunteers down  At the animal shelter  Right  At the animal shelter  Just snapping next  No one knows it though  Sorry  But I wanted to mention  The front page  Of the paper  With the dogs  Fucking photoshopped  On the Giants players  You said the ESPN Classic  The ESPN Classic  I was listening  It's a blast man  And they had  The 77 World Series  With of course  The Yankees  And Reggie  And his three home runs 
[00:32:30]  I caught the end of it  And then they did  The whole like  They don't just show the game  They showed the celebration  They showed the  The presentation  Of the trophy  To young George Steinbrenner  Came out  All full of piss and vinegar  Fucking  Like  Yogi comes out  And fucking  It was just  A great little glimpse  Of history  Yeah  Look at that shit  Come on  Billy Martin  Billy Martin  And they're pouring champagne  On the reporter 
[00:33:00]  And he's  Just about cursing  They  Wasn't that  They're drinking  They're fucking drinking  The champagne  Which they're showing  Like  And they really don't show that  These days  That's Bill White  Yeah  I don't care about things like that  I'm just so happy for these guys  That they're really great  Billy earlier now  You got a nice bonus  And you've got a sort of  A vote of confidence  So how about next year  For Billy Martin  Well next year  I hope we're going to come back  And do it again  Our organization is  Starting to build  Getting some more players  And we're going to be  Awful to them  Would there be any changes 
[00:33:30]  That Billy Martin  Might want to make  On this  I always hated that  Man  They just won the World Series  You're talking about  Next year already  And changes in that  Why don't you just  Enjoy the moment  They have  The interesting thing  About watching this  Is you have  The reporting is awful  The camera is just horrid  At one point  The guy can't even  Hold it straight  And then the field  Celebration  You forget how the fans  Ran onto the fucking field  And covered the field 
[00:34:00]  I fucking missed that  And it's like  How the fuck  Did that ever happen  That's what made  Those moments so great  When the fans were able  To just completely  Take over the field  They ran on  But going with something  You taught me years ago  You can never bring that back  You can't be the commissioner  That goes  You know we're going to allow  On field celebrations again  Look  Yeah that was awesome  When that happened  They ran over the walls  And just get on the field  And run around  And drink  They're drinking on the field  Running the bases  And the outfielders 
[00:34:30]  Now have to get off  The fucking field  With just hundreds of fans  Spilling over the sides  They also had the top 40  Baseball moments  And a few of them  Were fights  Where I mean fans  Jumping into the fucking field  And getting into fights  With the players  Then there was another one  Where I can't remember  The guy's name  But he's running the bases  And the fucking fans  Just came all on the field  And he's punching  His way through  You're right  Punching his way  Through the bases  Right  It was great 
[00:35:00]  He's got to touch the bases  Oh it was fantastic  Got to touch them all  Great moments  40 top moments  Yeah I gotta check that out  And uh  Yeah they had  The ones where  The fans would reach over  And catch the ball  That Thurman  Yeah of course  Yeah  Good old Thurman Munson  Thurman Munson  And all I was doing  Was watching it going  Dead  Dead  That guy's dead  A lot of deads  Yeah  A lot of deads  On that one  So  What's Thurman saying  I just want to hop in a plane 
[00:35:30]  And  Yeah  Like a flight  Buzz around  I'll buzz  I'll buzz you  And this was amazing  Because this celebration  This was actually  They won the third game  Of the season  And they were just  Thrilled about it  Imagine  Every game they won  They did this  Imagine  Every game  How fun would that be  That would rule  First game of the World Series  Is over  Let's go to the locker room  See what's going on today  Well  We're just partying  We're actually  Spring training  Yeah  Yeah we won our split team  Played today  Really happy 
[00:36:00]  Champagne  Well they actually lost  But they made a good comeback  And almost won  They lost 6-4  They were happy  That it was a good game  In April  Yeah Reggie  Yeah Reggie  Reggie  He was the man  Now that's a mustache  Three homers  Three home runs  And one ball game  And that sort of ties  A guy  Babe Ruth  Who did it  Twice  You know  It's a great feeling  A lot of people  Talk about it  You know  Great players  They're great feelings  And I think the word  That's superstar 
[00:36:30]  Is overused a lot  But I'm a superstar  The word really originated  Next year  I'm hoping to make  $50,000 a year  Yeah  Really  Poor fuck  I can now say  Look at that guy  In the background  That's not a guy  It's Sam Roberts  That's Dan  The Boston writer  Oh is it  Dan Shaw  Shaw  Fuck  Was it really  No one's going to get into shit  You know the guy I'm talking about  I just thought it was some ghoul  Standing there  Look down at your screen  Red headed guy from Boston 
[00:37:00]  Shaughnessy  Thank you  Something like that  Yeah  Okay  Wow  And look the camera angle  Like now they pull him to the side  It's all like roped off  So you know when they do an interview  They're not being interrupted  And they put plastic on everything  Oh and the 1977 fucking NYPD  Just you could actually see them taking payoffs  Yeah  And fucking shaking down drug dealers  He's actually being guarded by Serpico  The corrupt NYPD of 1977 
[00:37:30]  Just lounging around the field  Letting the listeners  Letting the fucking fans just get out there  And rip the field up  They didn't give a shit  Yeah  And the champagne just went everywhere  Ah  The guys knew to just go to the ballpark that day  With maybe shittier clothes or something  Yeah  Knowing they're going to get ruined  That's all  Now it's all calculated  It's so cool watching that old like shit though  It's just  It was a month after Elvis dropped dead I think  Yeah  September of 77 I think so yeah  Ah yeah I think you're right  All right 
[00:38:00]  Damn  That's a long time ago  It really is  Go forward a little bit  So you get Steinbrenner  Um  He wasn't the crying George  No  Mike Torres  Here he is  Look at George  I have something for you that looks nice to me  Billy here  Where's Billy Martin  Where's Billy  Where's Billy  Where's Billy  I'm going to hit him over the head with this  Baseball for the Yankees and for New York  I'm going to have to tell you  That it's been  But as long as it's culminated by this  Young George  It's worth it all  It's worth it all 
[00:38:30]  It's great for New York  Just great  Man a few words  How about let's giving this  Great  Wait till the 80s come  I have some big moves to make  I think Billy  Billy has  Somebody has  Billy's drinking  Yeah  Billy's drinking  Billy's not a bottle of whiskey  They just pour champagne over his head  You know Billy  Billy  His hair didn't get wet  I know I love how they pour it through  And like it  It doesn't get wet  But it pours out the bottom  Black people's hair is like a coffee

[00:39:30]  Actually  Actually it's almost a year ago  That Keith brought them in  That reminded me of a sandwich  We were going to do the homeless shopping spree last year  And Keith brought in the new crop of homeless guys  Yeah  And one of them was homeless mustard  It was about a year ago  Almost to the day  And he was a mess  And he kind of hinted he was a musician  So we found him a guitar  To this day people think he wasn't homeless  Because he had a Taylor fucking guitar  And you try to explain to these dopes  And they just don't want to listen  But we gave him a nice Taylor guitar  And he  He was homeless  Huh? 
[00:40:00]  He was homeless  I smelled him  He was homeless  Exactly  And he performed for us  And blew all of us away really  Yeah  And a year later  He's got an EP that came out  Yeah  So he's going to talk about that  And what has happened to him  In the past year  I believe he's not drinking  And I believe he's in a shelter  And he's really trying to get his shit together  It's a real rags to a little cleaner rags story  It's a real rags to a dumpster  The original video posted 12-11-09 
[00:40:30]  Okay  So just over a year ago  Just about  He was a complete mess  He was in the hospital the night before  He's got all his hospital bracelets on  So he fell down drunk  He was up all night  And then he did that version of Creep  That is just still doing really really well  Who sings Creep?  Whose song is it?  Radiohead  You think they've heard his version of it?  I hope so  Because it's an amazing version  And then he did some originals  And those were really good too  And then he went off  And came back a couple times here and there 
[00:41:00]  But a year later  His EP is out for people to buy  Yeah  So we'll talk to him next  Okay?  Pretty cool  Cool indeed  And other things too  Stay there  Follow the O.P.

[00:43:00]  Yeah  And we, uh, found a tailor  Yeah  And to this day people  We have them as tailor  Yeah, people think that it was your guitar  Hence, you're not homeless  Yeah  And you try to explain to these people  In fact, there's a line on one of these songs  I don't own this guitar  I don't even know  Oh, okay, good  There's a direct reference to that  Yeah, because they got obsessed with that  It's like, dummies  We work for SiriusXM Satellite Radio  You think we might have a guitar  I think we could find a guitar  Laying around the joint  I think we have every, uh, every instrument possible  And you picked up the guitar  And you played Creep  And the rest is history 
[00:43:30]  That video is pushing 2 million views  I know, right?

Siberia  Siberia 
[00:44:00]  But  Of all places  I mean, your version of Creep goes viral  But somehow then it goes even more viral in Russia  I don't, I don't really understand how that works  I'm internationally known, man  Yeah  Have there been a lot of views in Russia?  I guess so  I mean, I don't know how you can tell who's viewing what on YouTube  But  Yeah, there's a map  And then there's like  It's color coded  And, uh  Oh, okay  I wouldn't  Yeah, recently it looks like, uh  Looks like  Like the London area has, uh  Been turned on to the  How do you see that?  The song  Yeah, I know, I'm curious too

[00:48:00]  On field trips?  I know, right?  Ridiculous  Why?  What is that about?  Hey, man  I don't make up the rules  I just go along with it  Does anyone know  What that's about?  So what do they do?  Well, they wouldn't  Let me not go  Like, I went to the woman  You can't say  I don't want to go?  No  Because it was planned ahead  What are you supposed  To learn from that?  This whole thing  I don't know  Where do they take you?  Just do what I tell you  Or else  Well, originally  We were supposed to go  To the White House  And for the longest time  I was getting such a kick  Out of the idea  That these guys  All like swarming  Into the White House  How funny would that be?  But right at the end 
[00:48:30]  Right before we went  The Secret Service  Did background checks  And they were like  Oh, yeah  No, no, no  You motherfuckers  There's a whole shitload  Of problems  On this bus  So we ended up doing  We went to the Capitol  We went to the Bureau  Of Engraving  And Printing  Where they make the money  No, that was actually  Pretty cool  There was a bunch  Of ex-cons  It was kind of cruel  To show a bunch of  Like complete dust  To people all that money  And like march you out  It's a billion dollars  But you can't have any  Yeah, that is kind of cool 
[00:49:00]  All right  And then we went to  The Holocaust Museum  But for what reason?  And then you get on a bus  And come back to New York?  Yeah  What?  That is like  Reason?  What reason?  No  Is it like a little  Hey, here's some education for you  I guess that was the idea  And I really think  That the director  Just thought it would look good  On her record  Or something  Oh, look what I did  Look at this wonderfully kind thing  I did for these poor  Depraved people  Right  And she's a tyrant  The one that runs the place, huh? 
[00:49:30]  Does she get off on anything?  I think so  She likes it  She likes being in control  Of 80  And usually they're like  Ex-addicts, right?  Mostly  Yeah, that's the idea  Everybody there is in recovery  Of some sort  No, but I mean the tyrant  Oh, no, she's not  That's the problem  But you know  The people who are best at this  As far as like counselors and stuff  Are the people who are recovering themselves  And then there's those people  Who are not  And just have like  These weird judgments  That they really  In my opinion  Have no business working  And that, you know  What's the next move?  How much longer do you stay there? 
[00:50:00]  Well, it's a six to nine month program  And the idea is  They're supposed to find you  Subsidized housing  Does that scare you?  To leave that environment  And then really be on your own?  You know, they make  They make the environment  So unpleasant  That pretty much anything  At this point would be better  Yeah  I would be fine with anything  But do you feel like  It's easier not to drink  Because you're in the situation  You're in right now  The being on your own thing  Makes it, yeah  Makes the whole  Because right now  It's like really simple  It's really not that big a deal  I really have no choice  I get urine tested  Twice a week 
[00:50:30]  You know, it's like  In the situation I'm in  I can't  I can't do it  And there's some guys that do  They try to get away with it  They, you know  They time it  It's okay  It's not okay  It's institutional living  It totally is  Which is  Some people say  Is a better way to live  Like some people  Can only function  Under that type of environment  And particularly  People who have been  In prison for 20 years  Yeah  They don't know how to function  Without somebody telling them  What to do  They need someone to tell them  What to do  And keep tabs on them  Yeah  So what do you  You though 
[00:51:00]  On the other hand  Think that you'd be okay  Out on your own  I don't know  I don't know  I gotta give it a shot  You know  There's really  I don't have the answer  To that  What do you do  For cash  That's a perfect answer  What you just said  You don't know  You don't know  For sure  What do you do  For cash  How do you make money  Oh yeah  No  No you don't make any  I haven't really  Made any money  You know  I used to make money  You know  Panhandling  That was easy  But now that I'm sober  I don't do that  Yeah  They give you a little  Allowance once a week  You look at the allowance 
[00:51:30]  You go  I can make so much more money  Oh yeah  You're getting a streak  Oh yeah  Oh absolutely  Absolutely  But at the same time  Pretty much everything  I need is kind of  Provided for me  Are you allowed  To go out  And get a job  At this point  Yeah  That's actually  Part of the deal  Oh it is  They want you  To get a job  You got a little  Job out there  No no  I need a job  I need a job  Have you been  Like looking  What type of shit  You're looking for  In a way  Right now  I'm actually trying  To deal with  Some physical problems  I have  Particularly my feet  My feet are really  Screwed up  So I'm trying to  Deal with that  That's part of being  Homeless 
[00:52:00]  Jesus  You homeless people  The tendons  In the bottom of my feet  Have completely become detached  And I have bone spurs  All over my heels  Like mentally  No physically  Oh  Feet of bad memories  Don't play that  You don't like  The warm air  You've done some  Fine stuff for us  Daniel  We're going to tell you  That was last Christmas  That was your bottom  That was right there  Right there man  That's it  That's the bottom  Making our football  Wow okay  No that was the worst  Kiss I've ever had  In my life  It's got to be  No that 
[00:52:30]  Strange little guy  And I'm saying that  So you've got problems  With your feet  That sucks  Yeah my feet are really  Screwed up  There's scar tissue  All over my Achilles tendon  And stuff like that  Who knows  Who knows what really  How do you get that  There's some injury  That occurred  Because I was drunk  And stumbling around  I didn't really care  It didn't heal right  And now it's just  Sort of a  Consistent problem  And as I've cleaned up  It's just  It's getting worse  And worse  What are they going to do  For it  Well I have only  You know  I'm not really certain 
[00:53:00]  The doctor said  That most likely  What will be needed  Is a series of  Steroids injections  Into the bottom  Of my feet  So I'm not looking  Forward to that  But I need to figure it out  I need to fix them  Because they're really  Screwed up  So moving on to  And your feet  You need your feet  Yeah of course  Moving on to  The EP  So how did that  Come  So that was  That started I guess  I would say  With Rich Brownstein  Who was a guy  Who does  Looking for  The groove  And Cafe Wa  In the village  And he had heard me  Sing on the subway  Like five years ago 
[00:53:30]  Or something  Before I was on the streets  And had like stayed  And listened to me sing  For like a while  And let his train  Go by a few times  And saw me  In the village  In the following years  Deteriorate  And never said anything  To me  Never spoke to me  Until the night  Before I went to rehab  I was on McDougal  And he came up to me  And well actually  I approached him  About bumming cigarettes  Something for a cigarette  And he turned around  And he told the doorman  At Cafe Wa  To give me a cigarette  Which is kind of a trip  Because doormen 
[00:54:00]  Never give you cigarettes  So to have somebody  Tell a doorman  To give me a cigarette  I was like  Yeah right  And he went on  To tell me  This whole thing  About how he'd see me sing  And watched me  Get all fucked up  Over the last few years  And what the fuck  And I was like  I'm going to rehab  And he gives me his card  And then gives me another one  And he was like  Call me as soon as you  Got out of rehab  And so I did  And he booked that show  Cafe Wa  Which I promoted  The last time I was here  And I played that show  And that night  I met Hap Pardo 
[00:54:30]  Who basically  Was taking over  Rich's job  Because Rich and his band  Up and moved  To North Carolina  And Hap just sort of  Picked up the reins  In a way  And he heard  He heard me play  That night  And he got excited  About wanting to produce  An actual record  And he got some  Investor or something  He got some producer  In New Orleans  Or some place  To put in some money  On it  And you know  We made a record  Are you going to 
[00:55:00]  Make money off this  That's the idea  Right now  You don't need a little job  If this does okay  As long as you get  A good taste  A piece of the action  I haven't really made  We haven't really made  Any money yet  Right in the beginning  It's about paying back  The money to spend  To make it  Did you sign a little  Contract or something  At least  And then you got to  Distribute  Distribute  Yes  Are you on like  There's a website  iTunes or anything  Yes  I'm on iTunes  And you can buy it  On the website  Which is  DanielMustardMusic.com  And if I'm doing 
[00:55:30]  My job right  I should say it  At least three more times  Before I leave here  This morning  Of course  That's good  That's good  Yeah iTunes  Yeah  And it's on iTunes  On Amazon  How do they get it  On iTunes  Just Daniel Mustard  Yeah Daniel Mustard  Okay  Just download it direct  A bunch of people  Have downloaded it already  And they love it  Yeah  It's a five song EP  It's a five song EP  All originals  All original songs  And it's doing pretty good  It's getting good response  You know I think  It's pretty good  You know for what we  Had to work with  You know we had  Very little time  Very little money  But we made  I think a pretty quality  Right 
[00:56:00]  Record  Yeah we tried to  Produce something for you  And it fell miserably  Because you were  Still kind of  I was still kind of  Shit faced  Yeah you were  But we did try  And that's not my expertise  And certainly  Not with a guy  That wasn't  Sober yet  And that was the deal  With Hap  When I met Hap  Was like you know  The idea of  Really producing something  Not just like  Laying down the tracks  Right  And you got a band together  Too for your record  No not really  I saw some musicians  In the video  That's Hap and James 
[00:56:30]  They're the guys  Okay  Alright so you got  A couple guys playing  Yeah  To pump it up slightly  Although you don't  Really need to  But it works obviously  You know that's  A debatable point  A lot of people have said  They just want  Oh it's the acoustic thing  And I'm like no  I wanted  I wanted to put  A little something on this  Are you getting gigs now  Or  Yeah I played a gig  Last week  At a place on  Houston called Parkside  I need to do that more  You know I haven't really  Played too many gigs  But I definitely  Need to do that more  And will 
[00:57:00]  You know I'm sure  Right on  Gigging  Yeah you got to  Get out and play more  Yeah  Yeah that's definitely  Where it's at  After you get your feet fixed  Fix them feet  I've developed  This little limp  And it's become  I think part of my  Persona now  Jesus  But they're going to  Fix them right  Say what  They will be able  To fix them  I guess so  I mean I don't really know  I have a podiatrist  Appointment this afternoon  Oh really  So I'll find out  For sure  Exactly  Nice  I have orthotics  They help a lot  You have orthotics 
[00:57:30]  No I need to get  Yeah they fucking  Changed my life  My hips  Was getting  Yeah my hips  Numb  I was getting  My right thigh  What is it  I couldn't feel it  It's like all  All this  Nerve  Stuff  And what do they do  Put something in your shoes  Yeah it's like  I'll show you  It looks uncomfortable  But it's actually much  Yeah it's like an arch  It's a hard insole  But your foot gets  Really used to it  Oh my god  Holy shit  That looks like  Fucking  You're walking on cement  And is that 
[00:58:00]  Is that made  Like custom made  For my foot  Yeah  Yeah that's why  I need something like that  That works out very well  It feels really weird  At first  Like every step you take  You feel it  Every move you make  Then within 10 minutes  You don't feel it anymore  The next thing you know  Your legs are up in the air  You're getting your ass eaten  You don't even  You don't even notice  Once they pull out the jelly  It's all  A mustard  Someone's saying  That you said  The wrong website  What  Danielmustardmusic.com  That's definitely it  Yeah  Danielmustardmusic.com  They're probably  Spelling it wrong

[01:02:30]  Seem to thought I'd get it  Got one day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time  I don't own this guitar  Don't even own this clothes  Don't got enough to get far 
[01:03:00]  Still I go  Still I go  Keeping on my toes  Whether I will wonder forever  Whether I will shine  Either lights paid for and by one day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time  But now I can't believe 
[01:03:30]  And that's what you were so proud  I'm sure that you'll continue to one day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time

[01:04:30]  For calling this a crime  Seems a huff and sad and shy  One day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time 
[01:05:00]  One day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time 
[01:05:30]  One day at a time  One day at a time  One day at a time  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  The OBA Pioneer Show  On the Virus  in studio we got daniel mustard i guess officially i don't call you uh homeless  mustard anymore i remember the last time you were in we were still calling you homeless  mustard and you're like oh man come on that's all right i got a name i don't want to get i  don't want to be totally known for that but it's all right i still have the the homeless 
[01:06:30]  mustard.com website but it's it's fun it's not a bad name to have no it's not right it's not  memorable it's very memorable yeah it tells a story it tells a story but you know it's like  it's a funny thing when you're homeless people always think you've always been homeless and  you've never done anything and it's like you know it's three years of my life about five long you  know five you include but you know three years actually on the street so it's like you know  it's not my whole life it was my whole existence but it certainly wasn't long enough i guess yeah  are you in touch with the family um not exactly i did recently get in touch with a cousin of mine 
[01:07:00]  who i haven't seen since he was like 13 he's where he's here in new york working on a project  runway and um so that was really a trip to see him and he came and we hung out for a while it was good  good to catch up with him but the rest of them are kind of still um you know whatever on the outs  on the outs as they say what is uh what's that about or you don't want to talk about it  i i don't know i mean i can't really tell you you know when i you know in la before i i came out to 
[01:07:30]  new york i had kind of a nervous breakdown and i uh had never really been close to my family to  begin with excuse me um but at a certain point i i started reaching out to them and they were just  sort of like you know we'd love to help you once you get it all figured out and it was like you know  the point is i need help now you know to figure it out yeah they wanted to wait till i had you know  got myself together and then they would be like together and then come and see us when you're all  fixed yeah we don't want to deal with the broken mustard thanks thanks so much uh but actually 
[01:08:00]  the reason i moved to new york originally was because one of my sisters lived lived here and  uh she she married herself an investment banker she married up as they say and uh she you know  she's worth a shitload oh he is he is um and uh so i i came out and i lived in their house for like  six months but mostly it was because she wasn't going to be there most of the time she was in florida  with her kids so she's like all right well come stay at the house it's kind of empty it's just  her you know her husband's there and that was a bizarre period just living with the investment 
[01:08:30]  banker staring did you chill for the house yeah i stole the sofa like the moving trucks they're at  work yeah right now we know why you're not talking but that that just got old really fast they didn't  really want to deal with me and i didn't i didn't really know how to deal with myself so it's like  so you haven't been in touch with your sister and not really i have another sister  who every once in a while sends me a little comment on facebook and you know i would i i  want to talk to her kind of but you know it's just hard at this point you know it's just hard 
[01:09:00]  you know i don't have a phone much less you know and i could sit there on facebook all day sending  messages but i don't know i don't really know what do you do for the uh christmas uh being in your  situation oh yeah i mean as far as you know the home the christmas thing is kind of is kind of  annoying to me i hate christmas and mostly because it's also my birthday i was born on christmas  jesus oh and so exactly holy holy holy i love the people i got a sister-in-law i think it's uh 
[01:09:30]  christmas eve i believe i'm not sure yeah you get fucked no matter what my birthday's been  completely forgotten and your family always goes no man we'll do a little something extra for you  but they never could figure that out and it's really not the point it's like well whatever  you're too busy you know worrying about the birth of christ to worry about mine thank you  right and that's fine you know i'm fine with i'm over it i'm i'm a grown-up it's okay um so  whatever christmas is just kind of like whatever for me but yeah do they have a tree where you're  living yeah and they had a decorating party and everything i came down and watched it's great 
[01:10:00]  how many beer cans can you put on a tree you'd be you'd be surprised  no i actually know the amount yeah oh that's but we do it's one of those situations where like  do you do you ever now now not liking christmas seems to be something more because of maybe the  situation you're in would you like a time where you would be like wow this is kind of cool  like i'm with people that i kind of care about you know that's great to appreciate the people you 
[01:10:30]  love and to spend time with them do we really need a designated day of the year to do that i understand  that but it's like you know people are so busy with their shit it's very hard to get together at  a certain time because i know with me it is all about my family and everything like that it's not  it's not about who's giving someone a better gift or fucking doing this shit it's really hanging out  and laughing my ass off and then i guess i guess i've also seen way too much of that the sort of  competition of who's giving who what yeah that kind of shit and i just you know i don't know it's just  kind of old to me and um so whatever christmas there are still people out there that really just like 
[01:11:00]  the spirit of hanging out with the i'm giving away this for christmas that's what i don't know  where they are yeah i don't know uh daniel mustard's giving out his ep for christmas that's the present  man yeah merry christmas with that it's danielmustardmusic.com it's on itunes it's really  it's it's very inexpensive so i'm hoping a bunch of people buy it today help you out a little bit yeah  do it i want to see an actual fucking uh check that says your name i know right from these guys i'm

[01:18:00]  A year later, unbelievable  Ladies and gentlemen, your next American Idol  Oh sorry, American Idol  I fucked it up, I'm sorry  Fucking asshole, I'm sorry  I went with the real answer  Oh no  What a douche I am  I wanted to get him on America's Got Talent  I put your videos in there 
[01:18:30]  They didn't even fucking get back to me  I tried  Because that's the show for you  You know, a guy that was homeless  Is now singing like that  That's a good story for America's Got Talent  I've never even seen this show  So I'll take your word for it  It gets a few people watching  I see, I imagine  Is this thing Ben Fold is on?  I don't know  Oh, that's the sing-off  And then, yeah  There was a way to send in, you know, videos and stuff  No one got back to me  I'm like, you gotta take a look at this one 
[01:19:00]  Whatever  Yeah, whatever's right  Whatever, it's alright  I'm okay with that  People throw that one at me a lot  America's Got Talent  Or American Idol  Or whatever, whatever  And I'm like, I don't know  A little old for American Idol  So let's slow down a little bit  That's for teenagers  Whatever, whatever  I'm just like  I'm just fucking with you  He's only 22  Oh, yeah  He's gonna rest life on the street  Yeah, I'd rather just keep doing this  And, you know, I don't want to  I don't know  It seems like when you do those shows  You're kind of like in servitude to them 
[01:19:30]  For the rest of your life  Yeah, that is true  Yeah, they do make you sign away your fucking life  Yeah, so  They get a big piece of the action  The artists from the first American Idol season  Are still just touring  And fucking paying money to these motherfuckers  Are they forever?  It's like slavery  Yeah  Yeah, it's indentured servitude  And it's like, we made you  That's what they would say  You wouldn't have been here  You wouldn't have been on the national stage  It's like Kelly Clarkson, right?  Didn't she come off one of these shows?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Kelly Clarkson, it seems to me  Would have become a recording artist  Whether or not she was ever on that silly show 
[01:20:00]  So it's like, but they act like  Right  Well, she's not doing much of anything right now, so  I don't know  I just know she was kind of  She seemed kind of big for there for a minute  Yeah, she was  She was  Who else is big off that show?  Like, Ruben is stuttered  Nobody talks about  Clay Aiken  Clay Aiken's well done  Aiken geeked out a little career  How about Underwood?  Aiken for Aiken  Oh, oh my god  She, what's her name?  She's from that show?  Carrie Underwood?  Yeah, I've heard of her  Oh, yeah  Daughtry's doing all right  Yeah, there's some fucking huge stars off that show  Yeah  And it's usually the second place one that  Yeah, right 
[01:20:30]  It does pretty well  I think they do that  They're very calculated in that way  They make the best person the second place one  And then the winner can say they're the winner  So they'll automatically get some sales as being the winner  But the second place one is the good one  Is the one  So then they get twice the amount of fucking  Sure  It's a scam, man  I'm uncovering it on my next expose  Into American Idol  I was a singer  Was I a singer?  I was a Navy SEAL  That sang in my car  Is that Jesse Ventura? 
[01:21:00]  Yes  Jesse the body  And Jesse the mind  He likes his conspiracy  Yeah  I'm a big fan of the conspiracy  Loves it  So  Dummy  Well  I grew up on that stuff  That conspiracy theory stuff  Are you a fan of conspiracies?  Whatever  What's your biggest one?  Like I said, I grew up on it  Oh, I don't  You know, I'm not even  I don't have a biggest one or a favorite  It's kind of one of those things  You hear enough about as a kid  You kind of get over it  And you go, all right, fine  So the world sucks  And everybody's lying to me 
[01:21:30]  I get it  Thank you very much  That's pretty much it  That's every conspiracy  Is just, eh, whatever  You know, there's  Someone's bullshitting me  People just like, you know  They like to keep their secrets  And especially in America  We're all about image  And what it looks like  To the outside  Or what it looks like  In the history books  I just believe everything, though, now  Yeah, and that's kind of  Where we're at now  You either kind of want to  Kind of believe everything  Or kind of disbelieve everything  Everything, I'm told  I just  To take it at face value  Whatever the government says  All right  Okay  All right  You say so  I pay enough taxes  I figure they're not going to lie to me 
[01:22:00]  Attaboy  Wow  That's your mistake there  Wow  Hey, Brett in Virginia  Wants to hire Mustard  All right  Listen closely, though  Let's go  Go ahead, Brett  Hey, Mustard  Hey, how you doing?  How's it going?  Good  Good  Can you fly  For a bachelor party  Within a month?  Bachelor party  Stop performing  At your bachelor party  What, you want me to like  Strip or something?  No  Sober  We'll have our alcohol coach  Our sober coach there 
[01:22:30]  Promise  No alcohol  A sober coach  He wants you  As a designated driver  Well, I don't  I don't drive, Brett  So I don't think  I can help  No, that brake pedal foot  Might cause an accident  Yeah, that sounds scary  To have him  At a bachelor party  What the fuck  Are you going to do  To Mustard?  You know, I don't know  I'm  Geez  Well, what the fuck  So wait, wait  It's a bachelor party  You want Mustard  To perform  Where's the gig?  Virginia  Now, do you pay airfare?  I'll pay airfare 
[01:23:00]  All expense  Plus a little bit of cash  Or if you don't feel like  You can handle the cash  Pay some bills  I can handle cash  This is very suspicious  Are you talking about  A real gig?  It's really not  You know, I've gotten  A lot of these sort of offers  There's a guy in North Carolina  Who wants me to go to Ashboro  Like he's dying for me to come  Would you do the gig?  I don't see why not  You know, I don't know  Right now I'm just still  So kind of like  How long are you allowed  To leave though?  Oh yeah, I don't know  I mean, as far as like  The place I'm staying  I can't go for more than  A couple 
[01:23:30]  You're not allowed to be  Out of the house  For more than 72 hours  At a time  That's like  You could easily do that  You shoot down one night  You shoot down  On whatever the gig  It's a Saturday  You shoot down  What day of the week  Is the gig, sir?  Well, he's getting married  On a Saturday  We can do it any night  So yeah, he comes  We can do it a week before  If you've got to do it  On a weekend  We can do it the week before  I gotta ask  I mean, why do you want  Mustard at your bachelor party  When you can get  You can get some whores?  The question  They'll probably be  Stupers too, I imagine  The question is  Why wouldn't you want  Mustard?  Ah, look at that  Good answer, Brad 
[01:24:00]  I like that  He's a fan, Mustard  He's a fan  Yeah, but I'm dead serious  Yeah, talk to Jim  He's my PR guy  Now, here's the thing  How can they get in touch  With your guy?  How can they  Sir, can you leave your number?  Or Facebook, Brad  Now, leave your number  With Eric  What's your Facebook?  Sounds like a real name  Daniel Mustard  I'm all over my Facebook  Alright, he's on Facebook  All the time  God bless myself  Hold on the line  We'll get your number too  Alright  Let's go to Adam  In Jersey, Adam  How you doing, Adam?  I'm a certified orthotist 
[01:24:30]  I can make  Custom orthotics  For Mustard  Yeah, I would love that  Adam, awesome  I will come to Jersey  Even for that  Well, I'm in Trenton  That's not far  Or I can come into the city  On a day off  Hey, whatever works for you, man  I really need something  I really need something  Done about my feet  Yeah, your feet  Are very important  When I was in the NOM  They always told me  You keep your socks dry  And you take care of your feet  Yeah  Yeah  But I was having  No more of that  Skeeter shit on there  Is that what was causing 
[01:25:00]  My numbness in my right leg  And stuff, right?  It was  I still get it once in a while  When I wear my other sneakers  Absolutely  Yeah  Everything affects  From the feet up  Yeah, I'm having trouble too  With my right hip  And my back  I've got a crushed vertebrae  In my back  That's been, you know  A problem since I was 14 years old  So that's  The whole thing  Is just falling apart right now  My neck hurts  I'd complain  But who'd listen  Nobody  Nobody  Hold on the line  Let's definitely get Adam's number 
[01:25:30]  I want to get to you  Yeah, hold on  Adam's going to  Leave his number for you  Mustard  So  Can I say, man  That's a hell of a story  That's a hell of a year  Yeah, a hell of a year  For most people  Nothing happens in a year  For you  Big fucking changes  Turning around  The entire world has changed  Big fucking changes  For you  Turning around  Yeah  You were very unpredictable  When they first brought you in here  Yeah, I remember  You had to be watched very closely  Keith the cop wouldn't  Get to go too far  Yeah, you would  What happened to Keith?  Y'all see Keith anywhere?  I was just hanging out with him  At the Fuxwoods Casino 
[01:26:00]  Oh, right  Fuxwoods  But he was like  This guy could bite you at any time  He could run  He could fucking  Yeah  Yeah  But now look at you  Keith's got all the great stories  With some of these guys  That he's known over the years  Right  That have just done things  And then they sober up  And they're like  The nicest, greatest guys  But one guy  He's like  Yeah, this guy just like  Shits himself  Whenever he gets arrested  And that's kind of like  A defensive move  Like a skunk  If you corner him  He would shit himself  So you'd have to put him 
[01:26:30]  In your patrol car  And he would just smell  The whole car up  Or you would just  Not take him in  Yeah  So sometimes it worked  Oh, guys that would  Shit themselves  I would cry  That was my defense  That got me out of a lot of trouble  Because cops especially  Don't want to deal with that  They don't want to deal with  Oh my god, emotion  Oh, fuck  Crying guy  I was like  Oh, come on  What would they do when you cry?  I can't shoot that  So please  Drop the tears  Drop up  Yeah, right?  Oh, that's funny  I got away with a lot of shit 
[01:27:00]  I got stopped a lot of times  You just knew how to cry?  It's not like  You know  I'm not faking it  You know  The whole time  Most of the time  I was just  I was right there  Ready to cry  All the time  Anyway  And then like  You know  These two big horrible cops  Would come out to me  And push you up against a wall  And I was like  There it goes  Wow  Never mind  Go on  Go on  Go on your way  Did you spend any nights  We'll go rouse some black people  Never mind  Never mind  You ain't just whistling Dixie there  Yeah, sure  Central booking is out 
[01:27:30]  Lots of fun  We got a guy  Chris in Michigan  Chris  Any chance mustard  Could redo creep  Without people coughing  In the background  I forgot  We had other homeless guys  I'm pretty sure that was  Anthony coughing in the background  It was a tuberculosis ward  No, we brought in  Another homeless guy  I'm sure eventually  I'll have to do  Like a studio version of Creep  I imagine I'll probably  Be singing that song  For the rest of my life  But yeah  You have to get  Permission from Tom  Ah, fuck him  Tom York is not  Going to give you permission  He should though 
[01:28:00]  That would be nice  We were just  Talking about  Outside whether or not  We think Tom York  Has heard that yet  I think that would be  Interesting to hear  What he has to say  Yeah, I would want  On that as well  You kind of think  At this point  There's a pretty good chance  Of it, no?  Yeah, you know  According to that map  They like me in the UK  Yeah, they sure do  Apparently he doesn't  Leave the UK  He doesn't leave  Leave his house  Yeah, right  Well, you know  Neither did Brian Wilson  That's true  Good point  It was a little bit  Of agoraphobic  Yeah  Alright, Daniel  So it's  DanielMustardMusic.com  DanielMustardMusic.com  It's DanielMustard on Facebook

What do you expect next from this?  You got the EP out there  Are you guys pushing it?  What?  We're going to keep making music  Keep getting the studio  Yeah, I mean, people just  There's a huge demand for his music  People love him  That's all well and good, sir  But when is he going to get a check? 
[01:30:30]  He's got paid  It's going to happen  They gave me a little bit of cash  The day that we got the CDs  Okay  Which was nice  I'm just fucking with you  That's what they do  They just fuck with you  It took me a while to figure that out  Because I didn't know who you guys were  When I first came in here  I didn't know the game  We got to try to make it fun for the people  Right, right, right  And, yeah  I mean, I'll break down and tell you  I think this is a great story  No jokes there  So we're happy for Mustard  And hope it continues  And we hope that maybe he starts gigging 
[01:31:00]  You know, all over the place  Thank you guys for everything  No worries  What are you scouting next?  Port Authority?  See, that's what we do  See, now the people are laughing out there  That's funny  That's really funny  We try to keep them tuned in  We keep it too serious  They're long gone  We're going to go down to the Bowery Mission  It's like the new Seattle  That's great, man  No, but it is a good story  Because people, you know  People like a good story  And it's like  There's so many good singers 
[01:31:30]  There's a lot of really good musicians out there  Having a cool story behind it  And people feeling something  It's going to make people take another look at it  Which is great  And a lot of people think their lives suck  And think they're helpless  And this is a story where the guy turned it all around in one year  And that's something I've heard a lot  Is people like talking about how they feel like  They're not far from finding themselves homeless, too  So that, like, to a lot of people  Seems to, like, be helping them  Go, okay, well, it's not the worst thing in the world  And it's not, like, you know  The craziest thing in the world  But, you know, you still got to 
[01:32:00]  All right, guys, the big plug  Because we're going to play one more from this EP  We're going to do Impulse or Mars, Daniel?  How about you guys  So what do you guys think?  I think we should do Impulse  Impulse, all right  Jimmy's saying Impulse  Is that the hit off the EP?  I think it's this person  It's track one  The musician wants the evacuation to Mars  But the producers want the single  I know how this works  Actually, Mars seems more like a single  I've been around this business for a while  Now we'll play Impulse to my addiction  Impulse, it's a good sign  All right, and, of course, once again  Facebook, Daniel Mustard  iTunes, Daniel Mustard  And the website is DanielMustardMusic.com 
[01:32:30]  Yes, sir, thank you very much  All right, stay strong, brother  Thank you  Here's Impulse to my addiction  It's all my fault  Yeah, I never thought  And nothing else was true  But before I'm caught 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, before I'm through  Would you please explain this to me  Was I too blind?  It's all the same  Now this story ain't got nothing new 
[01:33:30]  And if I'm game  Or if I play on through  Neither will relieve my pain  When you're the conflict of my confliction  Stranger than all the fiction  Another contradiction  That I love you  When you're the constant of my condition  You take the strangest kind of position  You're the impulse to my addiction 
[01:34:00]  But I love you  I get it right  It'll take all night  I'm sure I've got a trick or two  It's in my sight  It's in my sight  It's whether I'm in my heart  I've got to make some peace with you  Because you're the constant of my confliction  Stranger than all the fiction 
[01:34:30]  I find another contradiction  That I love you  When you're the constant of my condition  You take the strangest kind of position  You're the impulse to my addiction  But I love you  And if I know what you were looking tough at  I set scatacombs while you were kissing the sky 
[01:35:00]  And if I tell what you'd be willing to try  Always awesome but never end  When you're the conflict of my confliction  Stranger than all the fiction  I find another contradiction  That I love you  When you're the constant of my condition 
[01:35:30]  You take the strangest kind of position  You're the impulse to my addiction  But I love you  You're the impulse to my addiction  But I love you  Something as simple as you sewn yourself together  Something as simple as I left myself on top  Something as simple as you stoned me out the weather  The stronger the impulse to my addiction 
[01:36:00]  And so my fellow Americans  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  This is The Virus on Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents  A Visit from St. Nicholas Part 1  Narrated by Big A and Stalker Patty  T'was the night before Christmas 
[01:36:30]  When all through the house  Not a creature was  Not even a mouse  The St. Nicholas 
[01:37:00]  The Harkings  Are hung by the chimney with a care  In hopes that St. Nicholas  Soon will be here  I mean, we'll be there  The children were nestled off snug in their beds 
[01:37:30]  While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads  And Mama, in her kerchief and I in my cap  Had to settle our brains for a long winter's nap  When I went out on the lawn  There was such a clatter  I sprang from the bed  To see what was the matter 
[01:38:00]  On the way to the window  I flew like a flash  Tore open the shutters  And threw up the sash  The moon on the breast of the new falling snow  Gave luster of midday to objects below  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear  But a miniature sleigh  And eight tiny reindeer  With a little old driver 
[01:38:30]  So lively and quick  I knew in a moment  There must be  The St. Nick  Are more rapid than eagles  His, his, his corsers  They came  And he whistled and shouted  And called them by name  Now Dasher  Now Dancer  Now Prancer and Victon  On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen 
[01:39:00]  To the top of the porch  To the top of the wall  Now dash away, dash away, dash away all  That was A Visit from St. Nicholas, part one  Stay tuned for part two  On the Opie and Anthony show  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  On the virus  Sirius XM  Ugh  Patty with that stupid voice when she reads  She fucks up every one word per sentence  In a really weird way  The children were nestled 
[01:39:30]  All snug in their bed  She puts on a dumb fuck voice  Shut up  You hag  The Christmas hag  Tells a story  Oh great  Suspicious  Suspicious package at Newark airport  We'll keep you informed  Jimmy's crotch isn't there yet  Haha, get it?  Suspicious package  And you're going there  You flying out of Newark today?  I go to LA  Oh boy 
[01:40:00]  That could be a problem  Nah, it's where it's hours from now  They make it news now  Some fucking faggot leaves his luggage by the curb  And all of a sudden the SWAT team comes in  Yeah  Blow it in place  It's not news  Hey, uh, Charles Barkley  You hear about Barkley  And what he was saying over the weekend?  What he did  He had something to say about Brett Favarar  You haven't heard this yet?  Uh, no, I have not heard this  Let me go right to the tape  Talks to WJOX in Birmingham 
[01:40:30]  Has this to say  This thing has never been  I can say  I'm a 100% against  100% against  Sexual harassment  But if you go back  That girl has never said  She was sexually harassed  Never  Not from day one  If she had said that  It would be totally different  But since then  It's been a money grab  The worst case  Brett Favar  Is just a freak apparently  And let me tell you something  I'm going to speak  I'm going to speak here  My biggest problem  With this whole  Brett Favar thing is 
[01:41:00]  If you're going to send  A woman  A picture of your junk  It should be huge  You can't send small junk  You can't send small junk  To a woman  And expect anything  Seriously  You have to be like  Ron Jeremy  Or some of those  Other porn stars  If you're going to send  A picture of your junk  To a woman  It should be humongous  It can't be small 
[01:41:30]  That's one of the  Ten commandments  There you go  Something we've been saying  Since day one  If you're going to  Send your junk  It's got to be huge  Got to be huge  That should be on a t-shirt  I love Charles Barkley  I do too  He's great  He does not give a shit  He's great man  Even with all the PC bullshit  Going on in sports  He still gets to  Kind of get his shit out there  Which is nice to hear  Everyone should know  You fluff a bit  You've got to plump it up  Don't get it to the point  Where it looks excited  Because that's cheating  It looks silly 
[01:42:00]  Unless they want  A fully rod picture  But just get it  A little plump  And then the angle  Is everything  Angle  Depth of field  And then you need  Some type of  Forced perspective  Like a baby's hand  Baby's hand  Sure  Sure  Sometimes they squeeze it  Like a toy though  Makes it jump a little  Does it get a little jumpy  Sure it does  Despicable man  I love how 
[01:42:30]  He turns his mouth  A little sideways  His teeth stick out  That is creepy  Sure  Sure  My chick's very mad  Because Uncle Paul  Has been molesting  A couple of the characters  Oh no  Yeah she gets really upset  That Uncle Paul  And she feels sympathy  For these characters  Do you guys understand  That most of them  You've never met  Oh I understand  You won't  Ever meet them  Why won't we meet them  They just wouldn't  Translate  You've never met  Jelly  Or Lumpy  Or Sheldon 
[01:43:00]  Or Spencer  You've briefly met  Eugene Mellencamp  And Edgar Mellencamp  The brothers  How many characters  Do you have  You've never met  The Gossip Kid  The Gossip Kid  Yeah you've heard  Little bits of  Yeah  Yeah there's a lot of them  You haven't met  But there's a whole  Inner working  And apparently  Paul's been doing  Some stuff  With Jelly  Who's three  Oh no  Believe me  Jelly's only three  Jelly's only three  Yeah he's very small  How does Jelly sound  Just like a kid  Can you say it  Or do it  Hi  Jelly 
[01:43:30]  Yeah it's getting  Tense around the house  Yeah  Yeah  She does not like  Uncle Paul right  She loves Uncle Paul  She hates Eugene  Oh really  Yeah well Eugene is  Yeah  Oh with the kisses  Yeah  Or lick my teeth  That was Edgar  His brother's Eugene  But Eugene is Southern  I get him so confused  You don't need to ask  God in your life 
[01:44:00]  Because he always tells her  That she's white trash  And doesn't have  The Lord in her life  She fucking  Oh shit  Oh that's good  If you knew  The fucking anger  I have faced  For Eugene  Because Eugene  Is the father  And apparently  Him and Uncle Paul  Have a financial arrangement  Oh really  I don't know  What's going on  Oh no  It's getting ugly  That's what my life is  These are just characters  Or is this  Something else  That's going on  No real characters  Real characters  Just characters  That you make up  Just a whole bunch of us  In one big house  And it looked like  For a while  That Chip was in 
[01:44:30]  On the molesting  It got very confusing  Chip just wanted to be  Part of the whole thing  I bet  No I was just driving  I didn't know  Uncle Paul  Ask me to drive  Oh oh  He would drive  Uncle Paul  Without knowing  What was going on  In the backseat  Before the payments made  Who was in the backseat  With Uncle Paul  Jelly  Jelly  Of course Jelly  He said there was  A few characters  That were molesting  Yeah but you know  Jelly would be back  I think Uncle Paul  Is stuck his cock  In everybody  Is Jelly just a nickname  I haven't come up  With a name for him

[01:52:30]  Yeah this is  It was just on on Saturday  But this is  This like they  Do you like this Sam?  I'm not a huge fan  So why are we playing it?  Just to show  Well because I think  It's important for us  To have our fingers  On the pulse of pop culture  And to talk about our opinions  Positive or negative  Alright this song is called  Just Had Sex  The new SNL viral song  Sometimes 
[01:53:00]  Something beautiful happens in this world  You don't know how to express yourself so  You just gotta sing  Have you ever had sex? 
[01:53:30]  I haven't felt great  It felt so good  When I did it with my penis  A girl let me do it  It literally just happened  Having sex  You make a nice man  Out the meanest  Never guess  Where I just came from  I had sex  If I had to describe the feeling  It was the best  When I had the sex  Man my penis felt great  And I called my parents  Right after I was done  Oh hey  Didn't see it there  Guess what I just did  I don't get it  Like I don't 
[01:54:00]  I understand what they're going for  But I don't get it  What part are you supposed to laugh at?  Blake Lively and Jessica Alba  Stars the girls  In the video  I don't care  I don't care  Just because the guy sang penis  Doesn't mean it's funny  They're all laughing  Because they heard penis  Yeah  The song is called  I Just Had Sex  And they're literally describing  I just just having sex  I just did have sex  Undress  All her poopers  And the rest  Was sure  Nice of her  To let you do that thing  Nicer than any girl ever  Now sing  I just had sex 
[01:54:30]  And it felt so good  It felt so good  I wanna let me  Work my penis  And shine  I wanna tell the world  To be honest  I'm surprised  She even wanted me to do it  Doesn't really make sense  But man screw it  I ain't one to argue  With a good thing  She could be my wife  That good  The best 30 seconds of my life  I'm so humble  By a girl's ability  To let me do good  Cause honestly  I'd have sex  See it was fast  The sex 
[01:55:00]  But that always gets a laugh  He didn't last long  It's just 30 seconds  What?  It's only 30 seconds long  Yeah we got it  Oh okay  By a girl's ability  To let me do good  Cause honestly  I'd have sex  With a pile of manure  With that in mind  A soft nice smell  And girls bitter  But she let me wear  My chain  And my turtleneck sweater  So this one's dedicated  To little girls  That let us flop around  On the top of them  Yeah  Eight minutes left in the song  No fucking way  What? 
[01:55:30]  How long?  Eight minutes  I couldn't got you that easy  You still got me  No  I would expect that  She kept looking at her watch  Doesn't matter how I say  But I cried the whole time  Doesn't matter how I say  I think she might have been a racist  Doesn't matter how I say  She put a bag on my head  Still count  I just had sex  I just had sex  Sex  Since my dreams came true  Dreams came true  We were in sex  In the last thirty minutes  Then you're qualified to stand with me

[01:56:30]  by the way  Grant in Philly wants to defend the song  Grant  Yeah, what's up guys?  You like the song?  Good evening  I do enjoy the song  I've had it on repeat  It's hilarious  Oh yeah  What's funny about it?  I just like  They're just coming at all  All the rap  And just  I think it's good satire  Everything that's on the radio right now  It's crap  They're just talking about 
[01:57:00]  Like, ah, I just had sex  It's great  I don't know  I think it's hilarious  Okay  See, it's a commentary  On the fact that in  Hip-hop music  They talk about  Having sex in the songs  And it's very literal  And so this one's very literal  Which is somewhat similar to Andy Samberg's song  On a boat  Where he raps about being on a boat  On a boat  A commentary on the fact that  They rap about their possessions  Their possessions  But he does it very  Very literally  Very literally  Yeah, yeah  Exactly 
[01:57:30]  Exactly  Let's do another song  Alright  It's no, uh, CeeLo  No, CeeLo  CeeLo, fuck you  Figure that shit out  That's a good song  Where it sounds like a real song  But it's really funny  It's funny  It's a great song  It's catchy  The Dick in a Box song  Was funny when it came out  Yeah, I didn't mind that one  I thought so  I didn't mind that one  This one sounds way too much  Like a regular song  Yeah  Well, it's not clever  It's not like  Oh, that's kind of funny  The idea of somebody's penis  No, there's a lot of cleverness in there  You thought so?  Well, they would say so 
[01:58:00]  I wouldn't think so  They did the joke where  He only lasted a few seconds  Best 30 seconds of my life  Yeah, see?  Yeah, that's funny  But I've kind of heard that joke  Like a lot of times before  That's funny  Alright  I'm funny, that's funny  That's funny, I'm funny  That's always been  It's always been a fave  I'm funny  Who is that?  That's funny  What the fuck?  I don't know what that even comes from  What's that from?  American Dad  That's funny, I'm funny  I thought it was Imus  That's funny  That's funny, I'm funny 
[01:58:30]  That's funny, I'm funny  But the kids are into it  They love the digital shorts  They sure do  You know  Do they?  They say he says penis like twice  That's funny  That's funny  He put his penis in her  That's a funny thing  Unbelievable  Yay  To say that about a penis  Kiss it  What?  Alright, well  There you go  SNL's got  A viral song  Yuck  It's no  Yuck  It's no  Father Christmas  Fucked My Pussy 
[01:59:00]  Oh  The new Christmas song  What is this?  Who does this one?  I think the art  I don't remember  I can't pronounce this  Mahala ZZ Diamond  Yes  What is this from?  It's the newest  YouTube sensation  Yeah, this one's a biggie  Oh  Oh  Okay  What is this?  Go to 
[01:59:30]  Is this  Podcast of  What the fuck is that?  Now this is a digital short.  What is that?  Is that a tranny?  I don't know, man.  I don't see a penis bulge.  They have something called a gaff.  A gaff? 
[02:00:00]  What's that?  Everyone pretends.  It's the thing they put in to tuck their dicks back.  What does it look like?  It's like...  I don't know, actually.  Is there a company that actually makes this?  I picture it looking like a small lacrosse...  What do they call a lacrosse thing?  Cock holder.  Yeah, a cock holder.  A basket.  Or a high-life fucking thing.  So it's curved like that, and you stick your dick in there and curve it under your ass, 
[02:00:30]  and then tape it down.  What if you get a hard-on while it's taped down?  You're a tranny.  What are you getting a hard-on for?  You ever watch the tranny films?  When fucking D-Boy was playing them, I saw them.  Oh, really?  I swear to God.  And they're getting their dick sucked and nothing.  They just like fucking nothing.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, what's the matter?  Which awful film was this?  I don't know.  Exactly.  We were all watching it in the office, laughing, saying like,  Oh, look at that.  It's silly.  It's got tits and a cock.  Oh, that pussy's got to be a fucking disaster. 
[02:01:00]  The dance is the best part.  The dance is pretty good.  It's a good dance. 
[02:01:30]  This is a nightmare.  Would you fuck that person?  No!  You would have to.  No.  You would have to.  No.  Father Christmas did.  Let Father Christmas fuck that pussy.  Of course he did.  I'm not touching it.  I like how it's Father Christmas fucked my pussy,  and then in parentheses it says Christmas Pussy Song.  Why would you add that?  It's a subtitle.  It's a new holiday tradition. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, tinny.  I got about a fucking microphone on.  It's like a tin factory.  Yes.  Tip it in.  In my car.  My answer's different.  I would not.  Fuck that.  That's a man.  Gregorio.  I think it is a man.  I think that's a man.  How did Father Christmas put it in? 
[02:02:30]  I got tricked at first.  I think that's a man.  No, no, no, no.  Father Christmas put it in.  Huh?  Father Christmas put it in.  Huh?  There's got to be some place to put it in.  Well, they'll call the ass the pussy.  Oh, will they?  Allegedly, yeah.  They'll say fuck my pussy.  Allegedly.  A lot of stuff.  Jimmy just seems to instinctively know some things about it.  You just guess.  They call me the guessing kid.  He's guessing.  He's got an app.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  His app tells him.  Oh.  Oh.  In my cont.  Father Christmas. 
[02:03:00]  Love my voice.  In my cont.  In my cont.  In my cont.  Yeah.  In my cont.  Sorry.  There's only eight minutes left.  Not far off.  The dance is pretty good, though.  This one doesn't know how to edit.  No.  No.  That's Brazilian, I think.  It's got 215,000 views.  People are enjoying the Father Christmas Fucked My Pussy video.  Of course they are.  Who doesn't? 
[02:03:30]  Is there a penis happening down there?  Yeah, there's something going on down there.  Come on.  No.  That's a man.  Look at that fucking shit.  It's a fake blonde wig on a man.  That's a lady.  I think it's a lady.  It's a lady.  Stop it.  It's a lady who does a marvelous dance.  Man body.  Man everything.  She's a marvelous dancer. 
[02:04:00]  Man, man, man.  I want to see a drug cartel come in and just shoot her.  Do you like to dance?  No, I hate to dance.  Look at the gut.  Look at the gut hanging over the pants. 
[02:04:30]  Fuck my pussy.  Fuck, fuck my pussy.  Father Christmas, fuck my pussy.  You know how this would be to play on regular radio?  You think the news will be like,  and here's another video that's really taken off.  Yeah.  It's called Father Christmas, fuck my pussy.  Christmas pussy song.  Christmas, fuck my pussy.  Fuck, fuck my pussy.  That's Christmas, fuck my pussy.  Fuck, fuck my pussy.  The beat is kind of catchy.  I liked it so much better the way Andy Williams did it 
[02:05:00]  back on his Christmas specials.  Oh, really?  It's haunting.  Did he do this song?  Should have picked maybe Bing.  Andy Williams did the Christmas specials.  Andy Williams always did the Christmas specials.  Yeah, go fuck yourself.  That was funny.  Shut up.  If it was Bing, it would be Father Christmas,  punch my pussy.  Are they sampling My Country Tis of Thee or whatever? 
[02:05:30]  Maybe.  You hear that in the background?  That was funny. 
[02:06:00]  Fuck, fuck my pussy.  This is pretty smart.  Yeah.  That was funny.  This is crazy.  You fucking.  Well, I'm just wondering if there's a punchline at the end of this.  I wish.  Writing is nice.  Can we get to see the pussy at the end? 
[02:06:30]  No.  Is there a big cock that comes out at the end?  A few people say it looks like Tracy Morgan.  It does.  A little bit.  Fuck, fuck my pussy.  The sound is so annoying, too.  The sound is so annoying, too.  Yay!  Father Christmas.  Longer boy.  I'm here.  I'm over here.  Beat your penis in my pussy.  Beat your penis in my pussy. 
[02:07:00]  Beat your penis in my pussy.  Father Christmas.  Longer boy.  Food.  Yay!  Wow.  One more time.  No!  Are there more videos by this lovely lady?  Yeah.  She's marvelous.  Something about the Easter Bunny.  Easter Bunny eats my asshole and sniffle on my taint. 
[02:07:30]  Let's see.  The Tooth Fairy fucked my face.  I mean, there is, of course, after Father Christmas fucked my...  There's Santa ate my pussy the Christmas vagina.  We have to hear a moment of that.  Oh, yeah, we have to hear a moment of that.  Yes.  That's fair.  Merry, merry Christmas.  Where's my dinner?  Merry, merry Christmas.  Merry, pussy, guys.  Merry, merry Christmas.  Where's my dinner? 
[02:08:00]  Merry, merry Christmas.  Merry, pussy, guys.  Smell up in your city, ass.  Smell up pussy everywhere.  Smell up, daddy.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I'm not in your office.  I'm going to give you my pussy.  Enough about your pussy.  You don't even have one.  She does.  She does.  This shit comes out of it.  That's all.  Hot back, pussy.  She's like the black version of Sandy Kane.  Is she black or Brazilian?  She looks Brazilian? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I know the name.  Black version of Sandy Kane.  Jesus.  It's still Sandy.  It's still Sandy.  I know what you say.  Does she have another song?  I see a third song there.  With my vagina, it smells gorgeous.  Okay, let's listen to that.  That sounds good.  I bet it doesn't, by the way.  I love the outfit change.  It's so sassy.  That thing is from England? 
[02:09:00]  Great Jamaican?  Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis. 
[02:09:30]  She claps like a man.  It's a penis, penis, penis.  It's a loud clap.  This could fuck me up.  Why?  Why?  Because if it pops into my head.  You don't want to dance to jerk off.  If it pops into my head, I will never be able to get a rod.  Yes, you will.  I don't want to get a vagina.  Iraq, can we play a real Christmas song, please?  Get this bad taste out of everyone's mouth.  Please.  There's only one Christmas song. 
[02:10:00]  This one's over here.  This one's got me nagling in my seat.  Oh, he doesn't like that when you do that.  He doesn't like when nagel is used as a verb.  Right, he hates that.  Eric Nagel does not like when people are nageling.  Why would he say that to people?  We call it nageling.  When somebody uses nagel as a verb, and he doesn't like it, so don't nagel.  He hates that.  Like, when have you used it?  Well, like, when I told him, because he's got a reputation for being sneaky and not forthcoming  about information.  Jesus said.  I told him, and so that's why when people do that, they're nageling, and I said, that's 
[02:10:30]  just one of your characteristics, so that's why we, and he complained that nobody else's  last name on the show gets used as a verb, and it's not right.  And other things, it's like, don't, you know, don't nagel it up.  Right.  Don't nagel the job up.  Right.  Yeah.  Don't nagel this one.  Why would he tell Sam that?  Because he's pissed at me.  Well, now everyone's going to fucking go over the top with it as a verb.  People wouldn't do that.  But I was telling you guys to stop.  You are, yes.  He doesn't like it.  Don't.  You got the Christmas song for everybody in your own. 
[02:11:00]  Please.  Didn't nagel that one.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Nageling this one.  Fa la la la la.  Gonna nagel that one.  Sorry, Eric.  Nageling my pants.  Fa la la la la.  Nagel on my shoe and in my front yard.  La la la.  Taking all the hard with the la la la.  Making my way to the la la la.  La la la la.  La la la la la la la. 
[02:11:30]  I like to drink a little beer.  I don't even care anymore.  Give it up, Greg.  Yeah.  He likes it.  I've been brainwashed.  I always sing at me around the house.  Do you?  Yeah, but as a goof.  Like, all obnoxiously.  Love. 
[02:12:00]  And the people in the light.  And the people in the light.  And all the children in the light.  He cares about them.  All right, that little taste of sleeves.  Doesn't he have a new Christmas song?  I know he has a Christmas record out that people are buying.  Wow.  Well, he's got a record out for Christmas.  They're not all Christmas songs.  Oh, really?  Not all of them.  It's like, does he have one on there that's a new Christmas song?  Let's find out.  I'll just go to radioghost.com and find out. 
[02:12:30]  Let me say hi to Patrick in Cleveland.  Patrick.  Oh, yeah, there's a...  Patty Kins, welcome.  Wow.  Makes you feel good.  On YouTube, there's Prisoner Christmas.  It's a cartoon.  And it's by Brad Neely.  And it's worth something, I tell you.  We should check out Prisoner Christmas.  I'll try not to nagle this one.  Yeah, Brad Neely.  Don't nagle this one up.  Oh, I'm sorry, dude.  I meant to stop doing that.  It's such a dick. 
[02:13:00]  All right, we're going to check out Prisoner Christmas.  And then maybe a new sleeves because we saw.  Or is it animated or...  Yeah, he said animated.  This one must be.  This is Christmas music.  Johnny wishes he was just a little bigger.  Frankie wishes he was back on the force. 
[02:13:30]  Harry Howe wishes for ladies and gals.  And little William wants to get a divorce.  It's Christmas, Christmas, Christmas Eve.  Can't leave.  It's Prisoner Christmas.  Da-da-da-da.  What is this?  It's like hipster comedy.  Please, oh, please release me this Christmas.  I hate hipsters.  It's like a bunch of people in their early 20s in Brooklyn  that think this is hilarious.  I hate hipsters.  Me too. 
[02:14:00]  I think my brother's a hipster.  Oh, shit.  Does he wear, like, a cool hat?  Yeah.  Well, Dee Dee wishes he had asked to see her ID.  And Freddie wishes he could kill them again.  And Jeremy...  All right.  I...  You don't like it, huh?  It's...  I...  I'm getting very, like, tense.  William and Berg should be firebombed.  It's kind of catchy.  No. 
[02:14:30]  Sounds like a novelty song from, I don't know, the 80s or so.  Really?  A little bit.  Please, please, please, please, please, release me this Christmas.  Almost sounds like the Violent Fist.  I love when hipsters think they're so fucking funny.  It's ironic.  Yeah, this guy's crazy.  Yeah.  You just wouldn't expect it.  Man, they really don't think like the rest of us.  No.  They march to their own drummer.  They're great.  That's why they just don't kind of fit in.  Can I say one weird guy I worked with, which...  That made me laugh. 
[02:15:00]  Yes, we can...  Tell us the story.  I did...  We're just killing time.  With a hipster?  No, no, no.  He's just a weird guy.  I did this show called Skits and Tits.  My friend Jessica runs it.  It's like a...  It's at the Bowery Poetry Club, which is in the village.  Literally 150 seats.  Very small, cool room.  I'm going to plug...  I'm going to plug Shapiro.  Rick Shapiro's taping a DVD there.  I don't know when, but look it up.  The great Rick Shapiro will be there taping.  It's an extraordinarily small space. 
[02:15:30]  And I did a set there, and one of the guys on before me was a guy named Ben Lerman.  Wait, you might as well turn this down?  No, I don't.  Actually, I don't either.  I am going to...  No, no.  I actually kind of like it in a weird way.  I kind of like it, too.  I don't know why I like it, but I kind of like that.  It's fading out, Jimmy.  Then we get to your story.  I apologize.  That's totally fine.  All right, homies.  Let's get drunk.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know why, but I think I like that.  Fuck.  Because it's annoying.  Anyway, sorry, Jimmy.  No, that's right.  And the guy's name was Ben Lerman.  And he sang a song, and it was just like, my name is Ben Lerman, and I play the ukulele.  And it just...  It amused me.  And it fucking stuck in my head for a week.  Really?  Yeah.  Just annoying you?  He was actually a funny dude, yeah.  Oh, that's not the song.  It's a video.  He actually has a video. 
[02:16:30]  That's not the video.  Oh.  Go to the video before you spit in your face.  It says, I play the ukulele right next to it.  No, but there is a video for it.  No, see, when you were there...  Oh, whatever.  He showed the video, and he even has a big celebrity in it.  You just passed.  I play the ukulele.  Yeah, I know.  Sam, what's the blue one?  It's a parody.  How about up one?  Up one.  That.  No, no.  Down.  Down.  Down.  In the video.  Down one.  Down one.  There.  Up one.  Why does he keep passing it? 
[02:17:00]  It's the opener.  Go to the bottom.  Go to the one over there.  What?  That can't be the video.  No, this is a video he made, but I guess it's not up online.  Why wouldn't he put it online?  Maybe it...  Why don't you keep looking down, Sam?  Stop just going through the same three videos.  Yeah, kick it out and go back up.  What are you doing?  I'm under a lot of pressure.  Yeah, you are.  You're really not doing well.  I'm getting conflicting orders. 
[02:17:30]  Is there an official video, Jimmy?  I don't know if there is.  I saw it.  But will it be good just to play any version of I play?  Do you play the ukulele?  No, I think the video really brings it together.  Can I just play the puppet access one?  No.  We don't do things half-ass in this studio.  Where's the official video?  I don't know.  It's not here.  Huh?  It's not here.  He's a big celebrity in it. 
[02:18:00]  Maybe he's got on a website.  Why don't you look for the website, Sam?  Oh, my God.  Which is Christ.  This website.  We're just stuck in mud right now.  It's amazing.  You really are.  But you're nagling this entire thing.  I'm trying not to nagle it.  I'm just trying to get out of the mood.  Poor you, Ryan.  I feel like we're just nagling our way to the end of the show today.  Yeah.  The end of the year.  Yeah.  This is going to last for three days.  All right.  Look, Jimmy, what about these?  Does any of these work for you?  It just says he plays the ukulele.  What about the other two videos?  It's live.  That's not video.  The idol in this video. 
[02:18:30]  The idol in me.  Material Santa.  Uh.  Vagine.  Uh.  Anderson.  Smell yo dick.  Uh.  Pussy pantry.  Oh, I didn't know Ben used this type of language.  He really likes his ukulele.  Can I just fucking...  Can I please play the live one?  Go ahead, but it's not the one I want to hear.  There is no...  I don't know.  Whatever, man.  If you think that's important.  He's all the way in from NYC.  Look, it might be a video.  It's a ukulele man.  It is obviously a video.  It's most of the picture.  Ben Lerman.  Woo!  Woo! 
[02:19:00]  I should warn you guys.  This song I'm about to do is a little urban.  A little urban.  When I say urban, what I mean is black.  I'm going to say black.  What I mean is Jewish.  Okay.  Here we go.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  It looks like a guitarist.  Two-year-old baby.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele. 
[02:19:30]  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  New York Times crossword.  Do it on the Daily Grey Lady.  Well, just munt, tooth, and wet.  First, fried, and sat.  Puzzle skirt my head.  Can't forget about Sunday,  because that's my fun day.  Just like Susanna Hoff said.  It was six o'clock this morning.  In the middle of a dream,  I was kissing Elmo underneath the golden stream.  See, my subconscious is all messed up.  I had deja vu when I saw two girls one cup.  And that video is gross.  Truly, I'm seeing what I'm trying to say  is to watch the whole thing.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  My name is Ben Lerman. 
[02:20:00]  I play the ukulele.  I saw one lady put the poop on the other lady.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  The other day, a teen missionary tried to save me.  She was off smiles, and I was all nice.  Then she sold me a big fat bag of ice.  And that's playing for crystal meth.  For those who don't know,  the agony and ecstasy of staying awake a week or more,  I'm just kidding.  I'm not going to swear to cranny anymore.  And for that, I have my parents to thank.  Because no matter what I did,  they always showed me love.  So I told that little girl,  I believe I got above.  But right now, I'm about to lose control of my battle. 
[02:20:30]  So please step aside for a poop on your bowels.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  I might have to hear it.  I'm all about syndrome, maybe.  It was running through my fucking head.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  On the way to the doctor,  the police delayed me.  They gave me a random back search on the subway.  I was like, wait,  I'm not black or Arab or Latino.  As I said, he went through my stuff.  My anger was ample.  I shouldn't have stopped that cop  before he found my stool sample.  He was all, hell no.  I was like, ha ha. 
[02:21:00]  He said, you can go.  I'll see you later.  I'll take him like a cop to the lab  that night to see a baby down in Mexico.  I picked up a parasite.  I feel for that cop.  In fact, it must be a jag  to find out white people  carry scary shit in their bag.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  Sometimes I have poop in my backpack.  Huh?  My name is Ben Lerman.  I play the ukulele.  There's a New York sportscaster  named Len Berman.  Crazy.  Page me, Len.  I think that we should talk.  Maybe grab a drink  or maybe go for a walk. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, what if it's not just  our names that's rehearsed?  Like if Len Berman  self-destowed as Ben Lerman  feel it first.  What if we each possess  half a special power?  If we ever got together  that magic would flower.  Bring about world peace  and that's a happy ending.  And then again,  if I release the Armageddon  it's too risky, Len.  Don't even email me.  My name is Len Lerman.  May the ukulele truth  go be.  They love it, Ant.  They love it.  It's a very popular song.  They love it.  I like the video  because Len Berman's in the video. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, he's actually in the video.  It was very funny  because the people  when Len Berman  showed up in the video  they were like,  oh.  They were actually starstruck.  Like, oh, Len Berman.  That's a big get.  Len Berman in your video.  Dude, that fucking...  All right, Anthony.  Now, you heard three songs.  Which one do you like the most?  I hate them all.  No, no, no.  You've got to pick one.  So it's either  Father Christmas Fuck My Pussy.  What was the personal one?  That's my favorite.  Oh, what about  Lonely Island on SNL?  No, no.  Let's just avoid it.  I have to go with  Father Christmas Fuck My Pussy.  I would think so, too. 
[02:22:30]  Should we play that  going at the break?  What?  You said you liked it.  No, no.  I said I hate it.  You did say you wanted to hear that.  I did say you liked it.  I hate them all.  I hate them fucking all.  I think my favorite  might be that weird prison song.  People are suggesting  that we stop playing this  and please play...  And go home.  And go home.  And please play  the Billy Mitchell interview.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, that would be great.  That's how bad  this music is.  My name is Ben Lerman  and I play the ukulele.  Oh, no.  That got stuck  in my fucking head 
[02:23:00]  a lot.  Oh.  Can we play a little  of the Father Christmas Pussy songs  as we go to break?  Oh, no.  Is James Smith  joining the program next?  Oh, is James here?  I believe so.  Oh, good.  I've got James Smith on.  He's funny.  Funny guy?  Very funny guy.  Yeah, he's doing...  I'll tell you,  he's not doing  the Borgata January 15th.  Oh, who is he?  Because Dave would tell myself  Jim Brewer  and Bill Burr doing it.  Had a nice long chat  with Attell last night.  And Attell's coming in tomorrow.  Oh, I'm gone tomorrow, but...  A rare appearance  from Dave Attell on our show.  Yes.  We love Dave Attell.  Dave's at Caroline's 
[02:23:30]  coming up as well  and so is James Smith.  James will be at Caroline's...  James Smith is promoting  New Year's Eve.  Is he New Year's Eve?  New Year's Eve, I believe,  at Caroline's.  Yeah, helping out  Greg Charles a little bit  and getting James Smith...  Yeah, James is funny, man.  ...to promote  the New Year's Eve show  at Caroline's.  But Anthony's favorite  of the ones we just played.  So here you go.  A little more  with Father Christmas  Fuck My Pussy.  A little more 
[02:24:00]  Turn it off. 
[02:24:30]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show on Facebook.  Facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:25:00]  We're going to have James Smith in studio in a few minutes from where?  Where is he from?  He's from Australia.  Okay.  And he's going to be performing at Caroline's this New Year's Eve.  Also, I want to do this for Jimmy.  People are actually kind of mad at us because we're playing these weird hipster songs.  Well, they should be.  And there's one.  I want to thank Skirbentine, I guess, on Twitter. 
[02:25:30]  S-K-E-R-B-E-N-T-I-N-E.  He writes, O.P., look up Fruitcake by the Superians.  It's the gayest Christmas song ever.  I am.  Hey, what's up, James Smith?  Good morning.  I know you, man.  You're a funny fucking dude.  Thank you.  Sometimes I don't know who's coming in here until I see their face.  Playing Caroline's New Year's Eve.  I am indeed, yeah.  Just to get you up to date here, we're playing really bad Christmas songs, I guess.  Oh, cool.  You picked a weird day to come in here.  We're just screwing off. 
[02:26:00]  Awful.  Got it, got it.  We're phoning it in.  But nobody ever listens to me.  This is an ad, right?  Huh?  Oh, they got an ad?  Oh, yeah.  So someone tweeted me and said, the Superians have the gayest Christmas song ever.  It's a song called Fruitcake.  And I think Jimmy said, you've got to play it on the air a little bit.  And then Jimmy runs out of here.  Yeah, so I don't know where he is.  He's going to play the whole thing.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, well.  Enough.  I see, what, you won some kind of a song parody writing thing? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, this is all outdated information you've been given.  Really?  Yeah, this is a form of life that I had in Australia.  Wow.  You don't do the song parodies anymore?  Negative.  Negative.  No.  That's how I got into this shit, so believe me.  Like, it works good to launch off.  Yeah.  And then you just start making fun of song parodies.  Like, yeah, listen to this hack shit.  And meanwhile, it's like, oh, that's right.  How did I get my line of work?  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  It means to an end.  Yeah, but a lot of song parodies are dog shit.  Yes, they are.  You made some great ones with your brother. 
[02:27:00]  I'm sure James Smith.  What was your best one?  Maybe we should play it today.  No, God, no.  Sounds like a terrible idea.  Oh, really?  Right?  If we get to know them a little bit, we're going to play it.  Aren't they all dated now and everything?  It's like, they're great at the time, and then you play them a few years later, and you're  just like, ugh.  Well, this one in particular wouldn't make any sense whatsoever, because it's all Australian  references, and you'd be like, this is terrible.  Get out of the studio right now.  I got you.  Don't hit the wallaby.  Don't hit.  Something like that.  Exactly.  But even worse.  Even more provincial. 
[02:27:30]  Good morning, buddy.  How are you?  More provincial.  We've got fruitcake for you, Jimmy.  I like this song.  This is being called the gayest Christmas song ever, so for the people out there, we've  got to give them a little taste.  I liked it.  This is the Superians.  Sounds a lot like the B-52s, and maybe a little diva.  What?  I think it's Fred Schneider.  No.  Oh, really?  This is what he's doing now?  Possibly.  How is he still?  Fruitcake.  What you baking?  Fruitcake.  That's pretty gay.  Just dancing guys in it. 
[02:28:00]  Topless.  Green cherries.  Red dye number two.  Green cherries.  Green ones too.  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be him.  Very catchy.  I don't know.  It sounds like somebody trying to sound like him.  Because it sounds like a very young.  Maybe it's just him trying to sound like him.  Yeah.  Someone.  Oh, Steven asked for Basher saying that this is Fred Schneider of the B-52s.  Yes.  And then writes, no wonder it's fruity.  Is he gay? 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  It affects the bell curve.  He's so gay.  Oh, really?  He was in here the other day.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  Sam just pointed at his asshole when he said that.  Is he just walking around with his asshole exposed?  What you making?  No.  Right.  You don't like this, eh?  Enough of the fruitcake video.  If you Google Kevin Bloody Wilson, the Santa Claus song, you'll get a funny Christmas song. 
[02:29:00]  Santa?  Oh, shit.  Because it's very blue.  You can play anything on here, right?  Yeah, we don't give a shit.  There's a guy named Jason from Tampa.  He goes, I'm telling you, play Merry Christmas, I Fucked Your Snowman by the Showcase Showdown.  It probably sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Jay Smith came up with this one.  Kevin Bloody Wilson.  Yeah, but he knows what's funny.  Hey, Santa Claus.  Quite often I get to thinking how as kids we got by. 
[02:29:30]  Like at Christmas time at our house, we couldn't even afford a fire.  But we made do with what we had back then when I was young.  Dad used to suck a peppermint.  We'd all sit around his tongue.  We couldn't afford no fancy tinsel for our Christmas tree.  So we'd just wheel our granddad in and make the old cunt sneeze.  And we'll even round the other side, Nana.  Picks up in a minute. 
[02:30:00]  I don't like the language, but...  I don't like the language, but...  I've got kids now of me own.  And I heard them unwrap their prezzies last night when I got home.  Hey, Santa Claus, you cunt.  Where's me fucking bike?  I've unwrapped all this other junk and there's nothing that I like.  I wrote you a fucking letter and I've come to see you twice.  You worn out geriatric fart.  You forgot me fucking bike.  It's catchy.  Yeah.  If I'd have wanted a pair of bloody socks, I would have bloody arsed. 
[02:30:30]  And this cowboy suit and ping pong set you can shove right up your arse.  You snuffed me bloody order up.  It's enough to make you spew.  But it's not just me who's snakey, mate.  Me sister's dirty too.  Hey, Santa Claus, you cunt.  Where's me fucking pram?  You promised me you'd send me one of you.  Remember who I am?  Because I'm the little girl what you made sit right on your hand.  What are you, you fucking ho-ho-ho?  You forgot me fucking pram. 
[02:31:00]  Next time I've come to see you, I'm going to punch in the gut.  And I'll let your fucking reindeer who's kicked Rudolph in the nuts.  Yeah, you just wait till next year till you get back to that store.  And me and me little sister come stomping through the door, I will say.  Hey, mums and dads, just smell his breath and check his bloodshot eyes.  And don't listen to him, boys and girls, because he tells fucking lies.  He's just a fistank and a pervert.  He's not even very bright, because the old fucking wanker forgot me fucking bike. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Santa Claus, you cunt, where's me fucking bike?  I've unwrapped all this other junk and there's nothing that I like.  I wrote you a fucking letter and I come to see you twice.  You worn out geriatric barch have got me fucking bike.  I'll dog you in, you cunt.  I'll tell me old man on you, he'll punch your fucking lights out.  I saw mommy sucking Santa Claus. 
[02:32:00]  She's blowing him.  That's a good one.  See, you have to understand, the way this came to me, it was 1984, so I guess I was 10.  Oh, shit.  And I was...  Oh, it's that old?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, this is super...  But he's a legend in Australia.  We've never heard of it.  Oh, yeah, he's got millions of songs like that.  He's an absolute legend in Australia and in England.  Anyway, I'm sitting there and it's like, you know, this time of year and we're at literally 
[02:32:30]  the most stiff people's house you can imagine, like the people who ran the church in the  community in this little country town and like people you weren't even allowed to curse  in front of.  And then one of the daughter's boyfriends puts this on and I've never seen comedy like  that in my life.  Like, this comes on and even the people who, you know, go to church and all this bullshit,  you know, they're laughing.  I'm dying and my father's there and I'm just like, wow.  I'm allowed to do this.  But Kevin Bloody is, he's huge.  Isn't that weird? 
[02:33:00]  He's huge over there and we've never heard of him.  Oh, yeah.  He's never heard that song before in my life.  Him and Rodney Rood, they're the two really big successful music acts.  Yeah.  Rodney Rood, we don't know here either, do we?  No.  Never heard of him.  No.  But Kevin's got other, you know, he's got a ton of great songs.  Yeah.  I want to go to Australia.  I want to do a gig there.  Let's send the whole show.  Yeah.  How great would that be?  Nice long flight.  Oh, fuck it'd be nice though, man.  First class though.  $25,000 to go first class.  25 G's?  Is it really? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  First class.  25 grand.  How much for business?  Business is 12.  It's a big difference.  Yeah.  And coach is two, which gives you an indication.  Coach.  Which gives you an indication of how it feels in college.  Wow, man.  Wow.  You've got to do that.  When you have to do that, getting up and walking around so you don't have an embolism or some  shit, that's coach on your way to fucking Australia.  And how many hours is it?  If you leave door to door New York, from your house here to your house there, 24 hours.  Wow.  And that's for coach?  How long for first class?  They get there a little quicker. 
[02:34:00]  45 minutes.  About 18 hours.  Yeah.  You make that flight a lot?  I've done it 11 times.  Wow.  Damn.  That's a lot of your life.  It's excruciating.  It's excruciating.  I think it should be like one of the punishments.  Literally.  When you're sitting there, you go, this is like the worst fucking thing in the world.  It's so long.  I can't imagine.  Like just being around people and in a tube and oh my fucking God.  And that is so fucking long when you're doing something.  Yeah.  Like that's a long time when you're fucking doing shit. 
[02:34:30]  You've done a 24 hour run at the casino, right?  Yeah.  And that's like, God damn, just get me to bed.  I've had it already.  And that's fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  I flew to Athens once.  I think it's 11 hours and I thought that was bloody hell.  And that's not even half the ride.  Well, here's the problem.  It's not even half the flight to Australia.  Here's the problem is the connection.  So you get on a plane here in JFK.  It's always going to be delayed.  So it's six hours to LA, right?  You get off and you go, wow, I just had a six hour.  Welcome to another 14.  It's like, fuck.  Oh, it's 20 hours total? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  So by the time you get to Sydney, you're like, you're not, you're not even yourself.  You know, you don't even know who you are.  How would you?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Oh, I just sit there.  Probably a hack question.  I just sit there and like, ask God like what I've done wrong to deserve this.  But you don't have music or.  Well, yeah, you do.  But you try everything.  You can only distract yourself so much.  You know, like there's only so many things that, you know.  What about sleeping pills?  But that only takes what?  Eight of the hours away.  You wake up and you got to take more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You wake up kind of hungover and whatever. 
[02:35:30]  If you can get into business or if you can get into first, if you're going to lie down,  then everything changes.  Yeah.  Don't they have the beds in first class?  Yeah.  Just kind of kick back.  Business is pretty close to, and they have this thing now called premium economy, which  is quite a farce.  Premium economy.  Premium economy, which means you give you a little more leg room.  You won't feel like a complete peasant, but you know, we'll charge you another.  It's still coached.  A few bucks.  Yeah, it's still coached.  A little more leg room.  Would you go business though?  Would you consider business?  I would go first.  I couldn't afford first.  And here's why.  Because I know I wouldn't be going to Australia again the next year even. 
[02:36:00]  So I might as well blow the load, pencil it in to the part of the budget, and just lay  down.  No, that's true.  But I wouldn't go alone, and I can't spend $50,000 on air.  I can't do it.  There's other ways to manipulate it.  You can do it with points or get a better deal.  $25,000 one way.  No, no, no.  But I mean if you bring somebody.  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah.  And if you're going with somebody, that's 50 large.  That's a long flight though. 
[02:36:30]  When Billy Crystal went and did 700 Sundays, I guess he took his play there.  Mm-hmm.  Did he?  They were going to fly private, but they didn't.  So they flew, I think, Qantas.  They just bought the whole first class cabin.  I bet that's a little more than $25,000.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's cheaper than flying private.  Yeah, because private's like $300,000.  $300,000?  Mm, return, yeah.  I wouldn't want to fly private.  Holy shit though, you can tell the guy would fly upside down.  Do some loops.  Do an Immelman.  Could you do an Immelman? 
[02:37:00]  Most celebrities don't go private down there.  They go first because the difference is so much.  Like 25 to 3.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like that's a big chunk.  Plus Travolta's flying.  He does that.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's also, private's a smaller plane.  You're not flying with the fucking, the king of guitar on a 767.  A private plane is small.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I would do first though.  And they got those beds that like, can two people fit in them?  Like if you bring a chick, can you fuck?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In fact, in the old days, the rumor goes, and I have it on good authority, 
[02:37:30]  that when Michael Hutchins was flying with Kylie Minogue.  Oh, yeah.  He was in first class.  This is before the pods or anything.  This is just when they had the flat seats.  He actually was fucking her.  And our prime minister at the time, Bob Hawke, who was a real larrikin,  you know, he turned around, saw them, and gave Michael the thumbs up.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  But yeah, and the new airbuses and stuff, you could easily capitulate.  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.  What's a larrikin?  Larrikin is like a guy a bit loose. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, okay.  Not your typical politician.  Like he had the record at Oxford University for sculling beer, you know.  Oh, nice.  So he wasn't your typical, you know.  He was more like, sort of Clinton-esque, but far more loose, you know.  Politicians are a lot more like that in Australia than here.  He's stuffy here.  Yeah.  Put up that fake front here.  Yeah.  It's reasonably similar.  Reasonably similar.  I mean, you know, the culture in general is more loose, definitely.  We don't have this political correctness or any of that, you know.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  They get mad when one of their guys lets a dog lick his cock, though. 
[02:38:30]  That was in Australia, right?  The soccer player who let the dog lick his cock?  No, I didn't hear about this.  Yeah, the rugby player.  The rugby player.  He's very famous.  Where was that, Sam?  Can you find it up?  They finally figured out where their line is.  That photo went everywhere.  That video went everywhere.  Yeah.  Was it a video?  I saw that photograph, I guess.  Australia, yeah.  It was Australia.  What's his name?  I'm sure...  James Smith and Stuart James may know his name.  You didn't hear about this?  Negative.  No, I did not hear this.  Joel Monaghan?  I guess at the end of the year, they throw these crazy parties and get really outrageous, 
[02:39:00]  and this guy decided to really go for it.  He just fucked his dog's mouth or something.  Yeah.  Just for a little bit.  It wasn't like he came.  Yeah, the football players get into enormous trouble in Australia.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they do all sorts of...  Because they're gods.  You know, sport in Australia is our Hollywood.  Yeah.  So it's like they're absolutely treated like gods.  What are the big sports there?  Rugby?  All the footballs.  So you've got Australian Rules Football, which is a national code.  Which is insane.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  It is.  Yeah, that's the most athletic thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:39:30]  You've seen video of Australia.  I've played that.  Yeah, Jimmy's played a lot.  Sure.  In the 80s.  Unbelievable.  But then there's Rugby Union, which is, again, no pads and just crazy, and it's our international  sport.  We sort of play that against the world.  And then there's Rugby League, which is the domestic sort of...  But all of those, all three codes.  Do you guys laugh at the NFL with all their pads and helmets?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  I mean, there's some unbelievable hitting going on in the NFL this year. 
[02:40:00]  But still, I mean, these guys are doing it without pads.  That guy's actually got his penis inside the dog's head.  How much trouble did he get in?  A little bit.  Yeah, not much.  What's terrible is that I just did a Google image search, and the clearest picture that  I could find, yeah, that has our...  It says opiananthonyvirus.com.  That's just coincidence.  Yeah, yeah.  They just associate that.  Guilt by association.  That's funny.  But you've got to be absolutely out of your mind on drugs or alcohol to put your dick in 
[02:40:30]  a dog's mouth.  I mean...  Well...  Jimmy's thinking, when I get home, go to the pet store.  It's wet.  It's warm.  I like that his pants are just a little down by his little smooth buttocks.  Just past his...  He doesn't want to get screwed.  Pull him up real quick if the poodle comes home.  Once again, though.  Or if the cat comes in.  The cat laughs at that.  Of course.  You're a dog.  Is he a rugby union player or rugby league? 
[02:41:00]  I'm sure it'll be union.  I don't know.  He's a pretty famous guy there, right?  Yeah, he was...  Yeah, league, league, rugby league, yeah.  That's way more their style.  But, yeah, the dog and...  Did he get fired?  He quit.  He quit.  Yeah, he got fired.  Hey, there's a lot of land to cover, even between cities.  So when you're touring in your home country, in your home continent, it must just take a  long time to get from one place to another.  It does, yeah.  It's massive gaps. 
[02:41:30]  There's only 20 million people in a landmass that's the same size of America.  So, yeah, it's a big gap.  Half the population is in Sydney and Melbourne, in those two cities.  Oh, so if you cover those two cities, you're fine.  Well, essentially, there's a few other places that you want to go to.  Yeah, but fuck them.  Yeah, exactly.  How far apart are Sydney and Melbourne?  An hour's flight.  Oh, that's not bad.  Oh, that's...  Okay.  So it's not bad.  And then, like, the whole rest of the country is just kind of...  Spread, yeah.  You know, the stereotype in America, of course, is the whole, you know, Mad Max outback.  That's pretty much what we picture Australia as being. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And there is...  That's most of the country.  The middle of the country.  There's basically Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane up here, Darwin, Perth, Adelaide.  That's it.  Just these...  All coastal.  All coastal.  Like, everything in the middle is just fucking nothing.  Desert.  Just pure desert.  Aborigines.  Yeah.  Aborigines.  A lot of Aborigines.  Can you get laid there?  Is it easy to get laid?  Um, not...  No.  Not as easy as it is here.  Wow.  Well, if you're Australian here, obviously it's easier.  It's cultural, see.  In Australia, you know, if you're older...  See, everyone in my generation is married with children, right? 
[02:42:30]  And so if I went to a club and tried to hit on a young girl, 21, whatever...  You just look silly.  I'd look sick.  Whereas in New York, they don't give a fuck, you know?  So it's far more open, you know?  It's far more open to trade here.  That's for sure.  In Australia, I would just be this old guy who just doesn't, you know, have much...  Yeah.  But the accent and shit really goes a long way with girls here.  They all love that shit.  To a degree.  More in the regional places.  Like, they're kind of immune now.  Like, when I first started coming here, you know, years and years ago, yeah, they were 
[02:43:00]  into it.  Or if you go on the road now, they're like, oh, I love your accent.  But here, they're like, whatever, buddy.  Now, it's...  They don't care in New York.  Yeah.  No one in New York gives a shit about anything.  They're like, are you God?  No?  All right.  Then piss off.  You know?  All right.  I mean, Prince William might get some...  Your people in your cock-blocking accent.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Prince William, that would get...  That accent would get a bit...  Yeah.  That's the real...  How do Americans do down there, though, as far as getting laid goes?  Like, you know, in the big cities, going out.  Really well.  Really well, yeah.  The Americans, yeah.  The girls are pretty into the Americans. 
[02:43:30]  Psychologically, we see America, in my opinion, is my opinion.  We sort of...  We look up to America, you know?  It's like, you guys are the big guys.  Well, literally, because you're in the Southern Hemisphere.  Exactly.  You have to kind of look up to us.  Exactly.  It's an Hemisphere joke.  They're always just...  Oh, hoot.  Yeah.  Wait till I get to the...  Yes.  No, I think...  Latitude and longitude line.  I want a Meridian tweet.  Quickly.  British meantime.  Yeah, they definitely do really well down there, the Americans.  Or Yanks.  See, we call Americans Yanks. 
[02:44:00]  Yanks.  Yeah.  And Yanks do very well, because girls, you know, they want to fuck a Yank.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, yeah.  That that word was around.  Like, we look at that word like the doughboys in World War I.  The Yanks are coming.  Yeah, yeah.  We fucking save.  The fucking Yanks are here.  No, we call them Yanks.  Or Seppos, for short, which is the rhyming slang for septic tank.  It's what you call a Yank.  And Seppos is even more abbreviated.  Everything in Australia is like, what do you call it, the slang.  Apples and pears, stairs.  Yeah, yeah.  Trouble and strife, wife. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So that's what they call a Yanks.  Yeah, he's fucking a Yank.  Sepp.  That's hysterical.  What the fuck is Sepp?  I'm looking at his resume.  You're a brainiac.  You're a smart dude, man.  Is he?  A banking and finance lawyer by profession.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you turn that into comedy?  By hating banking and finance.  Really?  He said, fuck this?  I'll do it.  Yeah.  And I know this goes back many years, but he was in the World Debating Championships.  Oh, I didn't know any of this about you.  What the fuck would you debate in that? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, horrible topics like, you know, the separation between church and state has gone too far.  And just the most mundane shit.  What was your take on that, quickly?  Oh, I couldn't remember.  It was like, this is 15 years ago.  Were you for it or against it?  I think we were affirmative.  I think we were affirmative.  I'm against it.  Yeah, exactly.  I would have just been bullshitting.  No, you wouldn't.  I'm trying to debate you, sir.  What I would do is I would select a partner who knew everything, like a real nerd, you know,  and then I would just let him go first and then I would just rebut, you know. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, that's a good idea.  Then you could kind of just pitch on to what he's saying.  Yeah, it was all bullshit.  Yeah.  So it was, it was very, but it was difficult because they would call you out, you know,  they have these points of information where they go, sir, on that, you know, and then  you have to respond.  I can't elaborate.  So, yeah, yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah, it was, it was certainly intense, but thank God that I don't have to do it anymore.  Don't they debate, isn't the debating like whether you have to talk very quickly to,  what was that?  Pretty much.  In America, I think the debates are they talk extremely fast. 
[02:46:00]  You've got to get your point in there as much as you can.  Yeah, it's about content in America.  It's far more focused on content.  So, you know.  But what happens is they give you a topic, you've got 15 or 10 minutes to go and prepare,  and then you've got to debate the thing, and then that's it.  Does it just degrade sometimes to call someone an asshole?  You can't.  No, you'll get thrown out of the tournament.  Ah, screw you.  But if you know you're going to lose anyway, you might as well get a parting shot in.  You fucking mother, you piece of shit.  I mean, you're talking about the nerdiest, you know, activity you can possibly imagine. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, how'd you fall into that then?  You don't come across as like the nerdy type.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just, I love public speaking and debating because it was fun.  It's like kind of where my stand-up origins came from, you know.  It was just really, really good fun, you know, and it was enjoyable.  Got chicks in the debating clump now?  Well, you got to debate them.  So like while the other guys were playing football, I'd be debating these chicks and trying to fuck them, you know.  So you probably learn a lot more about them, so you got that inside info.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  It's like, you know when I was debating you about that, I agreed with you 100%.  Yeah, exactly.  But to give you an indication of how heavyweight some of these cats are, this, the guy who won when we were at Princeton, the guy who won the whole world championship, he is now, or just has been for the last 10 years, like Rupert Murdoch's, you know, one of his major offsiders or advisors.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  So he's, okay.  These guys were thick, deep, deep.  Yeah.  You ever losing a debate to a woman and then just like when she's, like when no one else is looking, just ball your fist up and watch her collapse?  Many times, many times. 
[02:47:30]  But they were arguments with my mother, so.  So you, uh, oh, what was it, the John Mayer cruise?  I didn't know what that was.  John must have forgot to invite me.  You're on the list.  I saw it.  Damn.  He does, well, he did this cruise a couple years in a row and it was the Mayercraft carrier.  And it was just basically, they do those cruises, you know, and it was basically his fans going  on a cruise to see him and he brought a bunch of acts, you know, that, uh, that he liked 
[02:48:00]  to perform with.  What cruise line?  Big one?  Yeah, I think it was Carnival.  I think it was Carnival.  Yeah, Jesus.  And it's, uh, it was the best three or four days imaginable on the face of the earth.  You know, like it was just, you know, it was literally like going back to university  or high school.  Really?  It was just so.  I was going to say, I think his fans look a little different than our fans.  Yeah, exactly.  That must have been really hot.  It was fun.  It was fun.  John Mayer.  How many people?  Fucking fans.  That's a good question.  I don't know.  A couple of thousand, I would, I would suspect, you know, but it's just, they're all there 
[02:48:30]  for that one thing, you know?  Did you do stand up?  I did.  Yeah.  I did shows every night.  How was it?  It was great.  You know, he's, he's generous.  So like he would finish the show and he'd say, we're all going to go now to watch James  Smith's show.  And so you just pack the joint, you know, and it'd be awesome.  It was, it was really, it was amazing.  You know?  That must be great because usually if you go on a cruise ship, man, you see a comic, oof.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get a cruise on his, right?  Shit.  I could do anything.  It was, it was, it was awesome.  And so that, you know, they're supportive and once he's endorsed you, it's, it just makes  the show that much better.  Yeah.  And so we had a gala on there and I got to host that. 
[02:49:00]  That was fun for VH1, save the music.  And there was a bunch of acts too.  So that, yeah, it was a lot of fun.  You don't sleep.  You just party the whole time.  It's a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Dream gig, as they say, you know, 1% of the gigs you'd say, Jim, in, in this business  are a dream gig.  Most are fucking, there's a very, it's a, there's really very few middle ground.  It's, it's a dream gig where it's an abortion.  And that's a good gig.  Yeah, exactly.  And I performed on a ship.  I would like to, like the comedy style of boat ride, not quite as prestigious. 
[02:49:30]  It's a little dinghy that goes around Manhattan.  Fucking get nauseous because you're going backwards, you're performing backwards.  Fucking horrible.  Your whole career depends on it.  Like if the booker there watches you and you have a bad set on the boat, you don't work  there for a year.  I'll ask the, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you bomb on the boat, you're fucking finished.  You're out.  You're out, Tom.  I have heard that they do that to some comics.  Like they, um, if they're not doing well, they drop them off.  And like, like if they're supposed to go from Miami to the Bahamas and a couple of things 
[02:50:00]  and go back and they're not doing well, they drop them off in the Bahamas and say, fly  your ass back and pick up some other comic.  They do.  Yeah, they absolutely do.  I've heard that.  That's got to suck you there with your bags.  The ship's just pulling away.  I suck.  Yeah.  Oh, you talk to most cruise comics and they'll tell you it's very depressing out there.  You know, like you got, you got two shows over the course of like a week or something,  you know?  Yeah.  And then they, and then they, you know, as you say, if it, if it doesn't work out,  they get hurted.  Oh my God.  And like the people that are there are just this cavalcade of geriatrics or, uh, younger 
[02:50:30]  people that, you know, their sense of humor is not the same.  So it's very hard to please the entire room.  They're all going anyway, because it's the pre dinner show thing.  Yeah.  So it's not just, Oh, let's go see.  Let's see some comedy.  Yeah.  That's good.  I don't know how they do it.  It's got to be the top.  You got to be clean.  Completely unoffensive.  Yep.  Can't know innuendo.  Know nothing.  Like I've known guys who didn't, you know, like just a little innuendo and they're off  the boat.  So you're like, yeah, fucking out.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  They want nobody offended.  Yeah.  That's got to be tough.  I hate to do that show.  It is.  And by the way, I've been on a lot of cruises and I see the comic every single time.  Oh, you do?  Because it's fucking cringeworthy.  I will sit there and just, I'll lean over and go, Oh, this is horrible.  You heckle them?  And then we, we don't heckle them.  We heckle the people that are laughing at them.  Like somebody will start like chuckling and, and like a little too loud. 
[02:51:30]  You go, we thought that was funny.  And then the person will kind of look and then try not to laugh at the other shite.  So you're basically just ruining the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause it's horrible.  It's awful.  And then we leave like, I'll leave and my date is with me and stuff.  And we'll just leave going like, Oh, it's like real loud.  Open the doors.  Oh, I know.  But everybody knows.  And some people are in on it cause they're laughing that we're fucking mocking them.  But everyone knows cruise comics.  It's amazing how jaded you become though. 
[02:52:00]  Cause I remember doing one of those carnival cruises as a kid with my dad, like as a teenager.  And to this day, he'll still reference it.  He'll go, Oh, I remember that funny guy we saw when we were in the Caribbean there.  And I'm like, dad, you would like, now I think he's the worst hack I've ever seen in my life.  But back then I was like, Oh, that's funny.  That's great stuff.  I get a good phone call.  Brad in Jersey.  Brad, we're talking to James Smith playing Carolines this New Year's Eve.  What do you got, buddy?  I used to work on a cruise ship for six months as a DJ.  And I worked with the infamous comic Vince Champion. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, Vince Champion, yeah.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, he's a good college agent.  Yeah, he was a bad boy.  A little bit, a little bit.  Do you want to tell James Smith about him?  He was a rapist, putting it.  Yeah, he toured Colleges.  And in between the funny, he was raping girls.  Oh, perfect.  Allegedly.  No, I think he went away for it, right, Jimmy?  Thank God he was playing Colleges in old age homes.  Is he still in jail? 
[02:53:00]  I don't know.  I never met Vince.  Didn't know him, but I think what happened was...  I don't know this Vince.  I don't know what he does.  Yes, just tell him you don't want to be raped by him.  He'll understand, believe me.  Here's what I heard about it.  I don't know how true this story is.  I heard that he would say, after he did that, he would say, pray for me.  Could you pray for me?  He would make the girl pray for him or ask her to pray for him.  Oh, that's nice.  And some girl online wrote about it online, and somebody else connected to it.  Oh, that happened to me.  I think that's how he got in trouble.  Sam might want to Google him. 
[02:53:30]  Sam wasn't preoccupied sending cock photos to Iraq.  Sam, Google him.  Let's see what this rapist alleged.  Is he alleged or did he rape?  I think he's in jail.  Then he raped.  I believe so.  Is he still in jail?  We've been hearing about this guy for many years now.  Vince Chab, he's black comedian.  Did he look rapey when you saw him, Brad?  He looked rapey.  We love that word.  A rapey look to somebody, right?  Assange, I mean, if you look at Assange, I mean, that is not a Julian Assange, that guy.  He's an interesting looking guy, you know, like he doesn't look like you and I. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's got kind of a rapey look to him, though.  Sure does.  In that, I don't know.  And the lawyer's mad that the fucking stuff, the information was leaked.  It's the fucking greatest thing ever.  Everything's leaking.  Everything gets leaked.  But his lawyer's mad that stuff's getting leaked to the papers.  Yeah.  Oh, he looks rapey.  Let me see him.  Is that the guy, Jim?  Sam has to turn the thing.  That's the guy?  Somewhat famous man accused, convicted, and falsely accused of rape.  Oh, was he falsely?  No, that's a boxer.  There he is. 
[02:54:30]  Former Star Search contestant, no photo available, was an African-American comedian traveling to  the college circuit at the time.  He was arrested in connection with several rapes.  In 1998, he was convicted of one of these rapes at the University of Nebraska, and he's  still a suspect in as many as a dozen attacks on college campuses in six states.  Jesus Christ.  Serial rapist.  Violent rapes.  Was he funny?  I know nothing about him.  I mean, his personal life, yes.  All right, Jimmy, we know.  No, I don't know.  I never saw his act. 
[02:55:00]  Jimmy's like, look, I don't know anything about him.  He's funny.  I don't know what his act is like.  So they were violent rapes?  The violent rapes.  No, they were sweet rapes.  No, but some guys do.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  They were very cool.  They were tender.  Very cool.  Very tender rapes.  They knew it was him because every time he would punch them and just reiterate jokes that didn't  do well.  Leave that next line.  It's pretty brutal.  Well, the violent rapes always can't really coincide with Champ's tour schedule.  It's hard to read from here.  Champ spit on his victims. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, so he was a nasty boy.  Quizzed them about their sex lives and asked them to pray for him like Jimmy said.  All right.  Champ was arrested in Omaha in early May after witnesses heard a student scream from a piano  room at the Pasadena City College and noted Champ's license plate number as he fled.  The entertainment was charged with attempted rape and released on $10,000 bail.  Police Department in at least four states are investigating Champ in connection with four  rapes and two attempted rapes in Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Wisconsin. 
[02:56:00]  Champ was eventually convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison.  Wow.  Do you think they prayed for him?  I don't know.  They prayed before the rape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please.  I can't see them praying for him.  Don't let him rape me.  Dude, he got 40 years.  I didn't realize.  Good.  That's a lot of time.  Fucking rapist.  Good is right.  Yeah.  40 years.  God damn.  That's no joke.  40 fucking years.  That means he's got to do, what, 20 before he's eligible, you think?  At least, yeah.  I don't really, you know.  No laughing.  Eligibility.  That whole thing just blows my mind. 
[02:56:30]  I don't get it either.  It's like, if you're sentenced to 40 years, 40 fucking years.  Exactly.  I don't like the good behavior.  You're in prison.  Of course you're going to behave.  It's like the guy who shot Lennon, and he's been up for parole six times already.  Yeah, and he only killed him 30 years ago.  I mean, like, you know.  He should never get out.  No, he should never get out.  They say, though, if he does get out, that someone will shoot him immediately.  Everyone says that, but no one ever, like, Joel Rifkin got out.  And everyone was talking about how.  Was he out of jail?  Yeah, he was.  Joel Rifkin's in jail forever.  Or, uh, no, wait a minute.  The, uh, the, uh, the Reagan guy. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, oh, not him.  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  Uh, uh, Joel Steinberg.  Yeah, the guy that killed that girl.  Little Lisa.  Little Lisa.  He was head of Nussbaum, the dishy head of Nussbaum.  He was her husband.  Uh, yeah.  But the Reagan guy gets out, too.  He gets a day or two.  He goes home.  Yeah, he's another fucking piece of shit.  Yeah.  How do you, I forgot his name.  I just shoot the president and then get out.  That just blows my mind.  We're dumb.  We're a dumb country.  It really is.  I mean, that guy's out there again.  Dummies.  How's Australia as far as, uh, the criminal justice system goes? 
[02:57:30]  Pretty similar.  You kill someone down there, what happens?  Pretty similar to here.  Really?  Yeah, pretty, uh, pretty.  Well, you know, it depends on how good your lawyer is and what you can prove and disprove.  Same bullshit.  Pretty much the same.  Hey, is that girl still in jail that I saw, Ganja Queen, La Chapelle, her name is?  I don't know.  That's an interesting question.  See, I haven't been home for four years.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I wouldn't know.  Behind, then.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I get a little bit of news.  But yeah, that was interesting, right?  Yeah, they, uh.  Ganja Queen.  Look up Ganja Queen.  They convicted this girl of, um, she went through customs.  In Indonesia, with a boogie board full of pot, and you usually get death for that in Indonesia. 
[02:58:00]  They don't play games.  Yeah, they certainly don't.  But they said if she had just kept her mouth shut and greased a few palms, she probably  would have been okay and gotten been able to buy her way out.  But some asshole kind of trumpeted her cause and went to the media and forced the prosecutor's  hand, and the prosecutor went after her.  Is she kind of cute?  I can't tell.  Corby La Chapelle.  Oh, what's her name?  Chapelle Le Corby?  Chapelle Colby, yeah.  Wow.  She's having 20 years.  Oh, boy. 
[02:58:30]  She is fucked.  Yeah, those countries don't fuck around, you know?  Like, I've performed in, like, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and stuff, and they're like,  you know, you can't mention the president, or you can't say this about this, and you're  like, the whole time you're there, you're just like, you know.  Scared, pissless.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No littering.  And do you just go from the club to the hotel to the airport?  Totally.  It's like, don't walk around, don't litter, don't fucking chew gum, don't do anything.  I don't miss any of those places.  I went to Jordan, which is, you know, very open and very cool and everything, but I was  still very cautious about what I said and what I didn't, you know, because you've got  to...  What can't you say in Singapore? 
[02:59:00]  Singapore was more loose.  It was more Malaysia.  Oh, yeah.  What couldn't you say there?  I think you couldn't make fun of the president.  I think that was the big thing.  Just don't mention the president, or prime minister, whatever it is.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever their leader is.  And probably, probably I would say their religion.  You probably wouldn't be allowed to make any fun of Islam or anything like that.  Don't do that.  Can't do that here.  It's odd.  They usually have such a great sense of humor.  It's odd to think that they'd be uptight.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially coming from Australia, where you can literally say whatever, you know, you 
[02:59:30]  like.  I really want to do a gig there.  Well, I can tell you, I can organize that.  Because that whole thing, who was it on that talk show that we got a little, they were doing  the blackface thing?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey, it's Saturday.  Oh, stupid Harry Connachuria.  Harry Connachuria got all pissed off.  Oh, fuck him.  Like, shut up.  Beat it.  First of all, this isn't your culture, so shut the fuck up.  Exactly.  Suck it up or leave.  Do you crooner?  Had he not said anything, that would have just gone so unnoticed.  Right.  You know what I mean? 
[03:00:00]  Especially in Australia, because it's like, well, me being from New Orleans, I'm with the  people.  I was like, shut up.  Exactly.  Can we play that?  Is that offensive in Australia, because we're blacks?  Is the Jetson treated that way?  It just, it depends, you know.  We don't have.  A bunch of white people laughing at a bunch of white people in blackface.  Jesus.  Harry Connach Jr., all mad.  They were the Jackson Five, right?  Yeah.  Performing in blackface.  Jesus.  What was it, 19...  20 years ago, these guys were doing the same... 
[03:00:30]  Makeup, who cares?  20 years ago on this show.  Have a look at this.  Just have a look at this.  20 years ago, they're in blackface.  Yeah.  I love the fact that they could do this on TV.  They should.  20 years ago, and they won.  20 years ago, with the...  Said the same thing about Voss's act.  Yeah, yeah.  20 years ago. 
[03:01:00]  Because I know you were all medical students 20 years ago, but if we start here, and you  just tell us what you are.  Well, quite ironically, I'm actually a plastic surgeon now.  But see, there's no racist intent.  It just makes up the difference, you know?  We also don't have the melting pot that you've got.  We don't do any after...  I hope there, we'll have another couple of that after the break, because we're...  I know Harry Connach comes in and gets all mad.  You know what? 
[03:01:30]  I have to shut it up.  I know it would have been so nice for the promo, but we don't do any after this, so we don't  need it.  Well, is that really, really the case?  Does this mean this is my last appearance on Hey Hey Saturday for real?  Yeah, it is.  I want to do something about that.  I'm going to call him the...  What?  He's a bit sycophantic.  Yeah.  Hang on.  Hang on.  I want to know.  I want to know who you're going to call.  I want to know who you're going to call the Prime Minister. 
[03:02:00]  You go to the PM on this?  I'd go to the PM.  From the AM to the PM.  Oh, wow.  Look, that really excites me.  But something I want to do, because I noticed, look, when you were judging, very kindly judging  red faces, I noticed that when we had the Jackson jive on, and it didn't occur to me until afterwards,  that I think we may have offended you with that act.  And I deeply apologize on behalf of all of us, because I know that, you know, your countrymen,  that's an insult to, you know, have a blackface routine like that on the show. 
[03:02:30]  So I do apologize to you.  Thanks, Daryl.  And I just wanted to say on behalf of, you know, of my country, I know it was done humorously.  Don't speak just about me.  You know, we've spent so much time trying to not make black people look like buffoons,  that when we see something like that, we take it really to heart.  And I know it was in good fun.  And the last thing I want to do is take the show, like, to a real, you know, kind of a  stilling level, because I love, you know, I love the show. 
[03:03:00]  It's not white people's job, Seth, to do that.  No.  Shut up, Harry.  If I knew that was going to be a part of the show, I probably, I definitely wouldn't have  done it.  Oh, shit.  Shut up.  I got to give it up, because Daryl said, I told him at the break, he said, man, you need  to speak as an American, not as a white American or a black American.  How about as a boring American?  Shut up.  You fucking pontificated move.  Gives a shit that you dopey crooning songs.  I fucking can't stand him.  Apologizing. 
[03:03:30]  Sounds like Jim Garrison should be fucking going after Clay Shaw.  Clay Bertrand.  Hey, Hey, It's Saturday is like a cultural icon down there.  That's like our, you know.  Yeah, I guess that's the big show.  The big show, huh?  I mean, it's been gone for 12 years now.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they canceled it for no reason.  Still in reruns?  No, no reruns.  I guess they've just brought it back is what has happened.  But it was a phenomenal show.  6.30 every Saturday night before you went out.  That's what you watched.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And the whole country.  That's the difference with Australia.  It's like the old days here is when, you know, there's just three channels.  Right, right. 
[03:04:00]  Okay, so if you were on TV down there, the whole nation saw you.  Was Tom, who's Tom, oh God, he's an American comedian in glasses.  Tom Rhodes.  Didn't he have a show in Australia?  I don't know that he had.  No, he had a show in Amsterdam.  Oh, Amsterdam.  Yeah, yeah.  He had a show in Amsterdam.  But he did tour down there.  He was very, very funny.  Very funny, Tom Rhodes.  I know Arch Barker is an American comedian.  He was big down there.  Massive, massive.  I mean, he sells out everywhere, you know?  Yeah.  Just in, like, at the Melbourne Festival alone, he sells out, like, 30,000 seats in one month.  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's just, he's an absolute, he's the biggest name down there now. 
[03:04:30]  And we don't know any of this stuff.  I know Arch, but yeah.  I mean, you do a little bit because it's your business, but.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, yeah, Arch is an absolute beast down there.  He lives there now.  He moved there.  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he's probably making so much money.  Yeah.  And getting so much ass.  If you're doing nothing but fucking Australian pussy, you might as well.  Yeah.  How do the girls measure up?  Like, as far as American girls and Aussie girls, how do they, and you're personally. 
[03:05:00]  I think it's equal, you know, I've always, my whole life I've heard this, oh, the girls  in this place, the girls in that place.  I think the girls around the world are, you know, it's all equal.  Yeah.  There's more here, you know, and there's more diversity here.  That's one thing I will say about America is you get every shade, you know, which is more  interesting, because in Australia, it's white, you know, and then just white.  And paradise.  Yeah.  But, um, but yeah, I mean, I think it's, I think it's equal.  The only difference is that, you know, they're all married with kids down there, you know. 
[03:05:30]  Really?  From, from my age group, you know, whereas here I still got, you know.  They really just kind of marry young and get that over with?  Yeah, it's cultural.  It's cultural, yeah.  It's a cultural thing.  Because people aren't shooting for style, like, you know, in New York, LA, people are shooting  for something, you know.  Right.  Relationships and stuff are all secondary, you know.  So they're shooting for that career, you know.  Yeah, it's just fucking get married, have kids.  Yeah, exactly.  It's get married, have kids, and then that's it, you know.  And, uh, and you better do it quick, because you'll, you know, otherwise you'll be left  on the, on the shelf.  Yeah, yeah.  Rotting.  The rotting apple.  Yeah.  Like, I don't have a single male friend in Sydney that, uh. 
[03:06:00]  Really?  What's the divorce rate about?  I'd say to be very high.  I'd say to be very high.  Because I'm seeing the first of my generation now go down.  It's time to say, fuck this shit.  Yeah, yeah, totally.  Totally.  Because it's all so misguided, you know.  Like, it's like, oh, we've got to do this.  It's bullshit you do, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not based on, uh, hey, love.  No, exactly.  It's cultural.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  Love learning little tidbits about Australia.  Yeah, it's, um, it's very.  Yeah, I've got to get there one of these fucking years.  Oh, yeah.  If you set up a tour, though, it would be fun. 
[03:06:30]  It would be fun, you know.  Me and eight people in a theater.  How humiliating.  Wait, where are you going to get the eight?  Kenny, I'm sure he'll wrangle up seven bums.  You got family down there?  You want to have some laughs?  I don't walk the streets for you selling tickets, right?  I just, I don't, I don't travel Europe and nowhere.  I don't leave the country.  You should, uh, just try it out.  You would do well, though.  I, I, I know you'd do well.  No, you could.  Yeah, you would.  You could.  Everybody's been there, like, you know, all the, all the names have been.  You're universally despicable. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, maybe.  Bill Burgo's there.  Jimmy, you're a love.  No, you're right, though.  Does he go to Australia?  Yeah, he's been, well, he's definitely been, um, I'm trying to think of who else.  Arger's obviously down there.  A bunch of people have done, you know, Australia and done pretty well.  So, if you promoted it properly, you could easily do it, you know?  I should have a sign and I should, I should be like a one-man band and have, like, symbols  in my leg and fucking banging it.  Shut the down.  What a creepy hack.  With a sign on the back.  Funny show.  Don't you get, don't you get those random emails, like, we saw your special or we saw this 
[03:07:30]  or, you know?  Yeah, yeah, Australia.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a couple Australian fans.  Yeah.  There you go.  Very few.  Very fucking few.  I don't get the references.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we, uh, thank James Smith for stopping by.  Absolutely.  Uh, Caroline's New Year's Eve, right?  Yes, sir.  Caroline's on Broadway.  New Year's Eve.  It's going to be great.  Yeah, James Smith is very funny.  212-757-4100, so.  I've done the, uh, not done, I've been to a couple of New Year's shows down there at  Caroline's.  It's a lot of fun.  You're right there in Times Square. 
[03:08:00]  Two shows.  Perfect.  Midnight rolls around.  People actually go up, poke their head out.  Yeah.  Watch the fucking ball drop back downstairs and, uh, back to drinking and, uh, watching fucking funny  comedy.  Sure.  It's just a great revenue and, you know, the people, everybody on the show is hilarious  and, you know, two shows.  It's going to be great now.  Who are you working with?  Fun.  Uh, Nate Bargetzi, Mike Vecchione and, uh, Kurt Metzger.  Okay.  Yeah, they're all on the show.  All really funny guys from New York.  All New York comics.  Yeah.  Right.  We had Kurt on, uh, recently.  Very funny guy, too.  Vince August is on there. 
[03:08:30]  Cool.  Yeah.  Uh, let me see.  The Anthony Cumia, Texas Hold'em Extravaganza took place Friday night, of course, up at  Foxwoods Resort Casino.  It was great.  Thanks to all who attended and to Steven Singer Jewelers for providing gift card prizes.  It was great.  Visiting, uh, visit IHateStevenSinger.com.  Do that today.  Go there right now.  Remember to listen to the Anthony Cumia, Texas Hold'em Extravaganza radio special.  It's this Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern, right here on The Virus. 
[03:09:00]  And I will be gone.  As of, I'm doing, I'm taping Chelsea Handler tomorrow.  It airs the, uh, the 29th.  It's the last show of the year.  And I'm doing the Tonight Show Thursday.  So, uh, I guess I'll see a lot of you, uh, when I get back.  And, uh, if you want, I'll be, you know where I'm at the Borgatti, you already know.  And I'm doing that beacon benefit for Geraldo with, uh, Tom Papa, Louis Black, Seinfeld,  and a bunch of other comedians.  Jerry?  Yeah.  Ah, okay.  J.S.  Jimmy's last show of the year.  Are you paneling or stand-up on the Tonight Show?  Um, neither. 
[03:09:30]  It's a pre-tape bit that I did.  Um, I don't have a lot of faith in this one.  Let's hope it goes well.  Oh, come on.  Only to blame myself.  I know it's great.  You're just trying not to jinx yourself.  I had to be Santa.  I think it'd be fine.  That's gotta be funny right there.  That's already done.  I know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, yeah, I taped it last week, and I go out Thursday to throw it, to humiliate myself  on stage.  Me and Tom Papa were talking, like, what's worse than, like, when you do, like, one of  those pre-tape bits?  Because you gotta stand there with Jerry while it's happening, and if it's just not going  well.  And I haven't had any bomb, but I've had, like, one or two, like, ah, I wish that was a 
[03:10:00]  little stronger here and there.  And it's fucking humiliating.  It's like, it's like...  Oh, you just gotta kind of stand there.  It's literally, it's like watching yourself fuck and not get a hard-on in front of everybody.  It's fucking horrible.  Yeah, and Jay's always diplomatic about it, but sometimes during the rehearsal where it  doesn't go well, he'll go, man, and he'll walk over, and you know, he's talking to the  exec producer, and you're like, oh, oh, he's trying to save it.  Yeah, he's like, man, we could do this or that.  It's like when you tell your friends to watch a YouTube clip, you gotta see this clip, you  gotta...  No one's getting into it. 
[03:10:30]  They don't like it the same way you do.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  All right, Jay Smith, thank you, Jay.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you very much.  See you when you get back.  See you next year.  Love that one.  In the written word of the broken hearted, I don't know what you've heard, I don't know  where it started, but everybody knows there's a lesson left to learn from those.
