<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion surrounding Whitney Houston's death, focusing on her drug addiction and the prevalence of prescription drug abuse in Hollywood.  They played a clip of what they claimed was Houston's last performance, commenting on her declining vocal abilities.  The conversation extended to the subsequent hospitalization of her daughter, who was found unconscious after consuming alcohol and a sedative, highlighting a possible pattern of substance abuse.  Bobby Brown's emotional reaction to Houston's death was also briefly discussed.  A significant portion focused on a story from a Joe Rogan podcast featuring Joey Diaz, who detailed his past experience supplying cocaine to Houston and Brown, including his practice of diluting the cocaine. The hosts reacted with humor and disbelief, launching into a side discussion about cocaine purity in different locations.  They touched upon the muted reaction to Houston's death at the Grammy Awards, playing LL Cool J's opening prayer, and briefly mentioned the cancellation of *Fear Factor* and the enduring popularity of *Survivor*, despite lacking many famous contestants beyond Johnny Fairplay.  A final topic before moving on was a comparison of portion sizes in different types of restaurants, leading to a short argument about the definition of "child of the 80s".

The show then heavily featured a critique of the Grammy Awards.  Lady Gaga's outfit was deemed ridiculous, while Adele's performance and voice were praised, though her acceptance speech was mocked.  Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen's performances were also criticized, particularly Springsteen's choice of a new, unfamiliar song to open with. Nicki Minaj's performance was heavily criticized as "overrated."  A humorous anecdote involved a miscommunication about Nicolas Cage's presence in the studio, initially believing he was listening from their office.  This led to an awkward moment before they discovered he was elsewhere in the building.

This segued into a lengthy in-studio interview with Nicolas Cage.  The interview covered his eclectic musical tastes, a recent opera experience (including a humorous anecdote about being judged at the Met), his feelings about being parodied, and details about his new movie, *Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*, including filming, special effects, and the cast.  The conversation also touched upon past roles (including *Wicker Man*), his views on humor and irony, his personal life, and a viral picture of his Civil War look-alike.  An anecdote about Bram Stoker's *Dracula* and its Rhode Island origins was also shared.

The Cage interview continued into the next segment, veering off-topic frequently.  Topics included Cage's brother's radio career, the hosts' opinions on the Grammys (including performances by Bruce Springsteen, Kelly Clarkson, Jason Aldean, and the Beach Boys), Taylor Swift's image, and a lengthy, often vulgar discussion about Alzheimer's disease.  The "F.U. Line" segment was played. After Cage's departure, the hosts critiqued the publicist's handling of a previous interview with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Dr. Steve joined via phone, leading to a bizarre conversation about his wife's breast reduction surgery, a burst artery, and the humor found in large brassieres.  The Grammy discussion resumed, followed by a debate about iPhones versus Android phones, culminating in a Black History Month tribute to Kamala Harris.  Throughout this segment, profanity and sexually suggestive humor were prevalent.

The final segment began with a humorous anecdote about a father's frustration with *Toy Story*, which transitioned into further Grammy commentary.  Bruno Mars, Nicki Minaj (described as a "black Lady Gaga without the musical ability"), and Jack Black's presentation were negatively critiqued.  Nicki Minaj's and Lady Gaga's stage presence and use of gimmicks, lip-syncing accusations, Rihanna's appearance and relationship with Chris Brown, Katy Perry's performance and rumored relationship with Tim Tebow were discussed, along with Jack Black and Joe Walsh's appearances.  A significant portion focused on Dave Grohl's speech, downplaying Nirvana's significance compared to the Foo Fighters, prompting a debate about both bands' relative success.  The hosts mentioned their past association with Grohl and the Foo Fighters, comparing Whitney Houston's and Nirvana's record sales.  A humorous *NCIS* clip showcasing a presenter's lack of knowledge about the New York Giants was played.  The segment concluded with more Grammy discussion, including Adele's performance and win, Louis C.K.'s win, a critique of Linkin Park's Adele cover, and the hosts mentioning receiving tickets to a Bruce Springsteen concert.

The show ended with a contest announcement for Bruce Springsteen tickets at the Apollo Theater.  The hosts discussed their seating preferences and frustrations with potentially being seated further back than celebrities like Martha Stewart and her daughter.  They announced the contest rules, requiring long-term SiriusXM subscription, being 18 or older (and not Canadian), and the ability to travel to New York City on March 9th at one's own expense. Opie decided to give his ticket to Roland. A significant portion was dedicated to Valentine's Day ad reads for ProFlowers, Vermont Teddy Bear, and Pajamagram, emphasizing the urgency of ordering gifts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh my god, Whitney Houston's dead.  Good morning! Monday morning! Monday morning!  Good morning, everyone. Good morning.  Actually, I was in the bathroom with him. I was in a stall.  And someone was going, so, Whitney Houston, what do you think?  It's tragic. It's tragic. Tragic. Tragic morning.  Tragic morning. Good morning. Good morning, everyone.  You had a little extra there for the Whitney. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, that's nice. Ah, tragic.  It's always good to hear him say anything but good morning.  But he answers stuff with just one fucking word.  Tragic, tragic. Tragic, tragic.  Tragic, tragic. Good morning. Monday morning.  Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.  Look, I don't think the Whitney Houston death is tragic at all because everyone was expecting it.  Yeah, yeah. Stop romanticizing this broad.  But everyone kind of knows what's happening.  She sang a few great songs. She sold a shitload of records. 
[00:01:00]  She had a great performance at that football game once.  But the last 15 to 20 years, she was a drug addict.  Well, yeah.  A mess.  A mess. Everybody loved seeing it.  Boy, they would show, anytime they had video of her losing her mind, fucking, you know, just being a general degenerate.  Right.  People loved it. It's worth watching.  Very sad, very tragic, but my God, it was completely expected.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  She's lucky she made it to 48.  Saw that coming. 
[00:01:30]  Is that her final performance?  Oh, what is this?  What is she singing?  Well, TMZ, they couldn't get, you know, a video of the actual dead body, so they found Whitney's last performance.  Not for lack of trying, I'm sure.  I love TMZ.  They make believe, oh, no, we're just reporting here.  Yeah.  Really?  They are the definitive vulture.  They were trying to claw their way into the Beverly Hills Hotel to see what they could get.  Fucking jackals.  Yeah.  They are hyena.  But they make believe they're not.  Nah, nah.  Remember when we had Javi on the show? 
[00:02:00]  Javi.  And I called him out on him.  I'm like, at least you're being honest with what this is all about, because other places are kind of snarky about it.  And he goes, oh, no, that's not what we do.  Oh, shut up.  We're just reporting.  We're just reporting.  Come on out, Javi.  Right.  Javi.  Let's hear this last performance by Whitney Houston.  Two days before she died.  Two days.  What was it?  Some pre-pre-Grammy party.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Let's hear this. 
[00:02:30]  She looks all fucked up there.  What is this?  What is this?  That voice is gone.  That voice had been gone for many a year already. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, they tried to revive her, right?  I mean, revive her career.  Oh, okay.  You know, she had a million chances to get her shit together. 
[00:03:30]  Fuck.  Let she die in the bathtub, they're saying.  The bathtub.  Man.  With like four people right outside the door.  What the hell were they doing?  Not paying attention to her in the bath.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she...  There's some paddy where you're outside the door that you don't check on someone that might  have issues.  Some Valium, some Xanax, maybe some booze.  They're doing toxicology on her.  And then she hops in that bathtub and took a little nap. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  A little nappy in the bathtub and, whoops.  I'm stupid because I assume when you go under the water, it wakes you up instantly.  Ah, you gotta be fucked up.  How does it not wake you up instantly?  You would think.  The whole not being able to breathe thing.  Right.  A little water on your face thing.  Right.  Isn't that supposed to be the thing they do?  They put water on your face to wake you up and shit?  Sure.  There's plenty of water on your face.  Wake the fuck up.  Should have given her a snorkel.  Jeez.  Just have her fucking slip under the water, but she's breathing out of a snorkel. 
[00:04:30]  Unbelievable.  Xanax, Lorazepam.  Lorazepam.  Mr. Lorazepam.  And Valium were found around the hotel room and around the bathtub so far.  I'll tell you, those prescription drugs...  Not good.  I'm doing a number on people.  Yeah, not good.  That's like the thing with Hollywood and, you know, the entertainment biz.  It's not even about heroin anymore and the illegal drugs.  Mm-mm.  It's just all about, hey, doc, what do you got for me? 
[00:05:00]  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  The legal drugs are a lot easier to get.  Yeah.  You don't have to go to the hood anymore.  And then for some reason, yeah, it just doesn't seem like it's as bad as if they found, you  know, a needle in her arm.  Sure.  In the room and she's on the floor or something.  That would be, oh my God, she's got a drug problem.  But the, you know, well, she takes it for anxiety.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, she takes it for this.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, she's on that because, you know, she's got back pains.  And that, for some reason, is completely acceptable, even though I think the past 10 fucking big 
[00:05:30]  stars that have died have all died because of prescription drugs.  It's almost like heroin's better at this point.  Oh, heroin's better?  Heroin.  Oh, heroin is better?  Let's go to Matt on Long Island quickly here because he piqued my interest.  Oh, Matt.  Matt.  What do you got, buddy?  Yeah, so Entertainment Weekly, I know your favorite magazine, they posted on their website  all these different tweets from different celebrities, most of them in the music business.  Yeah.  And then they post this one tweet from old Candy Dish Years, Marley Madeline. 
[00:06:00]  Candy Dish Years.  Ah, that's a Jim Norton original.  That's funny, man.  We, uh...  It said, so sad, I recall seeing Whitney chat with Michael Jackson at Sammy Davis Jr.'s  house for his 60th anniversary party.  Wow.  Picking dead people.  What do you mean she saw them chat?  She's deaf.  She had no idea in her whole life how beautiful Whitney's voice sounds, and they had to use  a tweet from her about how she recalled her having a fucking conversation. 
[00:06:30]  She recalls seeing her jaw move up and down.  Right.  That's great.  She put her hand in the air and hoped she could feel some of the vibrations of speech.  Yeah.  She's just walking up, sticking two fingers on people's vocal cords.  Right.  Just out of nowhere.  Leave me alone.  Yeah.  How about you not comment on Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson?  You have no idea what they sounded like.  Yeah.  No idea.  Meh.  Thank you, Matt.  Thank you.  Meh.  Well, everybody's got to get their tweets in.  Well, that's the big thing now. 
[00:07:00]  If you're a celeb, you've got to get your tweet in when big things in the news happen.  Even the regular Joe had to get their tweets in.  Everyone had to get their tweets in.  Yeah.  Usually, though, the media picks up on the celebrities that are tweeting about a subject, and it's  like, they're just sitting there toiling over what to write.  God, these celebrities with their tweets, too.  They're so boring.  Oh, man.  Well, Pat from Unaki had a great gimmick going all fucking yesterday.  Yeah.  What was he doing?  He was retweeting everyone that said, Whitney, we will always love you. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, really?  And, well, originally, right before it started happening, he goes, who's going to be the first  shithead?  Yeah, dummy that is going to tweet, Whitney, we will always love you.  And then two seconds later, he just started retweeting everyone that was saying it.  Oh, that's classic.  The most unoriginal, hacky thing to write.  Was it celebrities?  Most of that he was retweeting?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All celebrities.  Yeah, yeah.  I was getting a whole kick out of that one. 
[00:08:00]  You know what bummed me out, you know, as I was reading all the Whitney Houston tweets  about her death, you know, I didn't read one about waiting to exhale.  I thought someone would make that connection.  Oh, boy.  I didn't think, I didn't think I'd go a whole day with.  Wow.  God.  I, uh.  I, uh.  Yeah.  I was.  There are no waiting to exhale jokes.  I don't know why.  I thought that was very obvious to me. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  A lot of people.  Well, Jimmy Norton was tweeting that he, he had people saying, Jimmy, I'm glad you're  taking the high road on this.  Right.  And he goes, I'm not taking the high road.  I just can't think of a joke.  Like, I was from the same school of thought there yesterday.  Uh, I couldn't really think of any, there wasn't any definitive joke there, you know?  And, uh, everybody was kind of trying for a joke with the Houston, we have a problem and,  you know, it just, but, but they didn't quite hit the mark.  So I wasn't going to just make the same jokes. 
[00:09:00]  Well, I said she died fucking trying to parachute with Bobby Brown's pants.  Oh, see?  See, I tried.  I tried to do something a little different.  You know, you take, you got to take a chop at, uh, one every so often, right?  But you got, you got to go different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The same ones.  The waiting to exhale thing.  My God, Matt.  Oh, my God.  And, um, Tom Papa was hilarious because he basically said, wow, Twitter has become a place  where if you die, everyone just makes fun of you instantly. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  But in this case with Whitney Houston, there were more jokes than any other celebrity that  has died recently.  And that's because everyone expected this.  Yeah.  They were all ready.  Yeah.  Well, they knew about it.  It wasn't like she died out of the blue and then they had a release like, oh, my God,  did anyone know she was on drugs?  Right.  And then the jokes start.  Right.  It's like we knew she was on the drugs.  Right.  What happens when your phone blows up because a celebrity died, if you check your Twitter 
[00:10:00]  or something, also, it's like Whitney Houston died.  Everyone's first thought, oh, my God, that's what?  Whitney Houston died?  Oh, my God.  And then you give yourself a second and go, oh, yeah, of course she died.  All right.  This was supposed to happen.  I got to think of jokes.  Right.  And then everybody becomes a joke writer.  Everyone becomes the fucking Stengel brothers when a celebrity dies.  They're all just texting away.  You just have to, though.  I don't know.  And, you know, because people are like, oh, you know, you're fucking making a lot of fun 
[00:10:30]  here.  But when Patrice died, you did.  I'm like, yeah, the point is really simple.  If you're close to the person that died, it's a whole different fucking ballgame.  And who said we didn't make jokes?  Well, we did.  There were jokes being made.  Yeah.  I guess not the edgy, you know, bad taste type shit.  Nah, you know.  I don't know.  I think we had a few of those.  Yeah.  I don't think.  But in general, that's how it works.  Whitney's friends and family were making jokes.  But I'm sure people in that circle, if someone else died, they're right on it, joking. 
[00:11:00]  That's just how it works.  There's a huge hypocrisy that goes on during these little circumstances.  When was the last time anyone cared about Whitney's voice?  I know she had a couple songs out recently that did pretty well.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But that's because they propped her up pretty good with, you know.  Backup singers and stuff.  All sorts of shit.  Didn't she have an appearance on one of those morning shows that just completely went awry?  Oh, yeah.  We played it.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, she hasn't been able to sing in years.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  Years.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  But in other news, we were talking about this before the show.  So Whitney Houston dies, and then her daughter, who's only 18, is rushed to the hospital.  But you're thinking, oh, my God, she can't take the death of her mom.  It's obviously horrible.  She was under extreme stress, said a family friend.  She's devastated.  She and her mom were best friends.  Yeah, that's horrible, right?  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  It's reported that the teenager, 18, had a few drinks and then was given a sedative by members of her mother's entourage, and then she passed out.  Mm-hmm.  So she's doing exactly what her mom's doing.  Yeah.  You would think you would learn.  You would think.  And they're saying, they're hinting that she might have a little of her mom's talent, her mom's voice, but they're also saying that she might share some of her troubles as well.  Well, growing up with her and Bobby Brown would have to be just watching this drug-fueled fucking outrageousness. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're probably going to latch onto it.  And the teen was captured on camera last year snorting white powder that appeared to be cocaine.  Uh-oh.  She said she had been set up.  Set up.  So.  How are you set up when you're actually snorting it?  18 years old, already going down that road.  Yeah.  Having the parents you have.  I would just assume, but you said it.  You said some people will completely stay away from it, and others will just go down the same road, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:13:00]  There's no guarantee either way, I guess.  Whenever your parent or parents do something fucked up, you either do it, or you stay as far away from it as possible.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess, well, from reports, it looks like she's kind of gravitating towards the bad side.  Yeah.  And Bobby Brown, I guess, is doing a performance, and he couldn't make it out for the first song,  and then he came out, and he looked up to the sky and wished her well, and through your tears, he finished the show. 
[00:13:30]  What a bummer for everyone that had a ticket to that show.  Where was that, Mississippi or something?  I think it's a bummer for anybody that had a ticket for the show, regardless of what happened to Whitney.  Jesus wants to see that shit.  What was it, new edition?  New edition, yeah.  Back together?  New old edition.  How about you sit this one out, Bobby?  Yeah.  I think people will understand.  I don't think anyone would give a shit.  It was a nice night out for a lot of people, and you're blubbering on stage. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, you're bringing everyone down.  More down than they need to be.  What a downer.  What a downer is right.  When I lose control.  I had to fucking listen to all that shit.  Did you hear the track was going around Twitter yesterday?  I fucking didn't save it.  Whitney Houston's vocals isolated.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, I didn't see that one.  You realize how just amazing she was. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, when she was good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, I thought you meant...  You know how they could isolate that shit, and now, in this day and age, that gets out  there.  I don't know how you can find it quickly, but...  Oh, well, from 1985.  Yeah, this is isolated vocals.  This is from How Will I Know.  This is in her prime, man.  All right.  Let's give a little list.  Let's see if this is the one I heard yesterday.  There's a boy I know.  He's the one I dream of. 
[00:15:00]  Looks into my eyes.  Takes me to the clouds above.  Oh, I lose control.  It's like an American Idol audition.  Yeah, I know.  Acapella just standing in front of the judges.  Right.  I think from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?  That's before they added all that shit to the song.  Who?  How will I know? 
[00:15:30]  Don't trust your feelings.  How will I know?  There's a little echo and reverb on it, but...  How will I know?  It's acceptable, right?  A little room.  There's a little room on it.  How will I know if he...  That goes on and on, but you just realize...  Yeah.  What a fucking voice, man.  That is amazing when you could just pull it out of the music like that and it sounds  like that.  I would defy 90% of the artists today to release their fucking solo track like that. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, how great would that be?  That's what we need.  Without any auto-tune or anything else.  How great would that be?  But, yeah, man, she was a fucking talent.  A lot of people saying, don't blame Bobby Brown, that she had her issues before she met  the Bobby Brown.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I don't think...  But a bunch of people calling out Bobby Brown.  Really?  I think Piers Morgan was one.  Piers.  Basically saying, you know, what a fucking asshole.  Well, I think he was an enabler, but they probably enabled each other.  You think she already had her issues? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I think so.  She probably did really early on.  Yeah.  You know?  She gets all that success relatively young.  And then, you know, that's kind of a hard thing to deal with.  You see the Joe Rogan video that went around yesterday, too?  No.  Of Joey Diaz?  No.  You didn't?  No.  Joey Diaz, one of Joey's close friends.  We've had Joey on.  Sure.  We had him on once.  He did great for us.  But I guess he's out there in L.A.  So we don't see him much. 
[00:17:00]  No.  In fact, he used to do...  I don't know if he's still doing drugs.  I have no idea, to be honest with you.  But basically told a story on Rogan's podcast, how he was selling shit to fucking Whitney  and Bubba.  Whoa, damn.  That's an exclusive.  Well, this video should go everywhere.  Yeah.  Because it says a lot.  Damn.  Is that...  Is this it?  Yeah.  It's a long video.  It's...  Roger Rogan's always up there in the fucking podcast.  This is a great story.  I forgot about this.  I was thinking of Stan Hope on the way up here. 
[00:17:30]  And our friend Mike was selling weed.  But at one time, he worked at CAA.  And he goes, listen, one of the interns over there, me blew up.  He ended up being Whitney Houston's manager.  And, you know, and the tour manager.  And he's looking for powder.  So every day, they would come over, and I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.  You know, they would come over with like $1,100, which was per diem money.  I was taking Whitney's per diem money, right?  Every day, they'd come over with a little white envelope and give me the per diem money.  And I'd go up to the Martell cartel, and I'd buy 14 grams of blow, take an eight ball out, 
[00:18:00]  and cut it, and then give it to Whitney Houston.  That's Stan Hope smoking.  And they were fucking going crazy.  They just went on for 30, 40 days.  But I could snort all the blow.  I couldn't snort it.  It was just too much.  So I was giving it to Marilyn Martinez to hold for me.  Isn't she dead?  They're all stoned up.  They're laughing, too.  Yeah, pause.  So basically, he was buying the shit for Whitney and Bobby,  and then he was taking an eight ball out and then, you know, cutting that much back into it. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  And giving it to them.  Well, you've got to step on it a little bit.  Come on.  You've got to take a little something for the effort.  I used to do a little of that shit in Geneseo, but I'm convinced now that I'm older that I never did cocaine officially.  You probably never did.  You did a Nostitol or fucking baby laxative and fucking...  How badly do you think it was stepped on by the time it got to Geneseo, New York?  Wow.  Yeah, by the time it reaches that, you're not getting any coke.  So I'm going on record, and I'm going to say, because I've said it over the years, I've never done cocaine. 
[00:19:00]  There's no way.  Yeah.  It comes into Miami, and by the time it gets to Geneseo, New York, you tell me if I was officially snorting anything that resembled cocaine.  You snorted baking soda.  Right.  That's pretty much what you had.  Speed, probably.  Yeah, with some fucking, yeah, antihistamine in it.  How many stops before Geneseo from Miami?  Miami.  Wow.  That's, yeah, once it hits Miami.  I mean, just moving up the Florida coast, it's going to be stepped on a few times. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, by the time it passes Orlando, it's fucking done.  Right.  Then I'm sure it's got to stop, I don't know, maybe in Washington.  Oh, Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Fuck that, and then New York City.  Philly, New York, Jersey.  Trounced upon.  And then maybe if you get over to GWB with that shit on its way to Geneseo, maybe one more time.  One more time.  In Roscoe, New York.  You got a little Coke, right?  A little Coke in Roscoe.  Ah, get the fuck out of here.  But then once the Geneseo hits, it's over, Johnny. 
[00:20:00]  I always had a little bit of guilt that I did cocaine back in the day, but now I don't have any guilt.  I don't think I'd touch the shit.  Never touch the stuff.  Because if Joey Diaz is stepping on it and he's getting it in L.A., come on.  That would mean I would have to have a lot of trustworthy people that they weren't stepping on it from Miami all the way to Geneseo.  Excuse me, could you please not step on that cocaine until I get some of it?  Yeah.  Don't take any profits. 
[00:20:30]  That's well over 20 years ago.  The first thing you did as somebody who would sell cocaine was, and this was the absolute first thing you did.  Right.  You stepped on it so you could take shit out for yourself.  Right.  It's exactly what you did.  You didn't even hope to make money on it.  You hoped to break even and get some coke for yourself.  Yeah.  And then you'd do it again.  You'd buy some more, step on it.  Anyone that was dealing coke had their own problem. 
[00:21:00]  And now you have to trust that they see this pile in front of them.  They're not going to take and taste or step on it.  It's like, you know, I really want to do the coke, but I want my customers to have the best product possible.  Yeah.  You know, I do have some integrity.  Right.  Real corporations have no integrity.  You're hoping for integrity from a coke dealer?  A coke dealer is going to be the go-to guy. 
[00:21:30]  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you probably didn't get any coke.  This guy goes, where is he?  G.H.  Stepped on.  That shit was danced all over.  Who was your dealer?  Fred Astaire?  J.D. in New York City.  Yep.  Let's go back to the Joey Diaz story.  Selling cocaine to Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, the Joe Rogan experience from Joe Rogan's podcast.  This thing is going to really, I think, take off in the coming days.  Yeah.  So, okay.  I got like two ounces of blow, plus I snorted all this coke, and I can't snort no more. 
[00:22:00]  I do it, right?  So, one night, I call Marilyn.  I go, Marilyn, bring the coke down to the fucking store, all right?  I'm selling coke to Whitney fucking Houston.  They're picking me up at nine in the morning, paging me on the red pager.  I'm coming downstairs, getting in the car with them, going to the Martell cartel, to the brothers, going in the house with two grams of coke already cut in my pocket.  And I would just go in, take rocks out, throw the cut in, mix it up, and give it right back to them in the car, and they'd be happy as shit. 
[00:22:30]  They were inviting me to A&M Records to come party with them.  I don't party with them.  So, how much coke were you stealing from them?  I was selling them.  I was getting them a half ounce and taking an eight ball out and throwing an eight ball to cut in.  What is an eight ball?  Three and a half grams.  I've done coke my entire fucking life, and I don't know, like, what it costs.  People are so sleazy that it's all cut.  No, no.  Do you ever get pure coke?  I don't know what it's worth.  You know I always know where the fucking shit is at. 
[00:23:00]  I know, like, coke because someone goes, hey, do you want to do a bump?  And you go, okay.  Right.  But you don't know what the fuck's going on.  He's never bought it.  He does whatever.  When you go out with Stanhope, somebody got coke, he'll do coke.  You got an elephant tranquilizer.  Stanhope's like Uncle Joey.  We don't give a fuck.  The train's already running.  I got nowhere to be tomorrow.  Fuck it.  We're here already.  You know, when I got here, and he said he had mushrooms, I'm like, what the fuck?  This is the cocksucker that knocks on your door with rolling papers and no weed.  You know what I'm saying?  I got no weed, but I got rolling papers.  Next time you bring those fucking mushrooms with you, and we could have been right here. 
[00:23:30]  This would have been a great fucking podcast.  Not that it isn't.  So, I'm robbing Whitney and Bobby Brown for a fucking month.  I'm robbing their blow every day.  I can't do it.  I can't snort it fast enough.  How much are they doing?  They're doing a half ounce a day.  This is why.  This is God.  This is 90.  No, this is 98.  They're doing a half ounce a day, which is three ounces a week.  Oh, my God.  And singing.  What does that look like?  Whoa, an ounce is like this.  Oh, my God.  Like a half ounce of weed.  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:00]  They're doing one of those a day.  Oh, my God.  Bobby Brown, his face twisted.  And I was getting this shit that was flaky.  Oh, my God.  So, right.  I tell Marilyn, bring the Coke to the store.  You would say, like, well, aren't they feeding an entourage at this point?  No.  But that's the thing about Coke.  It's just those two.  You start, oh, there's only so much Coke left.  All right.  You got to go.  You got to go.  You got to go.  Right.  So, this went on.  So, on Saturday night, I called Marilyn Martinez.  I go, Marilyn, do me a favor.  Bring the blow to the comedy store because I'm just going to sell it. 
[00:24:30]  That's hilarious.  And after my set, it gives me a little baggie with the bottom of it filled up.  Like, not even two lines.  And I put it in my pocket and I take it home.  When I get home, I do it.  It's not Coke.  It's crank.  So, I'm on fire.  It's three in the morning.  I'm in my house on fire.  I got the Coke hidden in the trunk of the car.  His shoe hasn't stopped shaking since.  All right.  I have the Coke in the fucking car.  No, I'm not bouncing.  I have the Coke in the car.  I always do that shit.  I have the Coke in the car, right? 
[00:25:00]  And I wouldn't bring it upstairs.  Right.  Because I don't like Coke in my house.  So, I would go down and do a little bump about five in the morning.  Whoa.  You would always keep it in the car?  In the car, right.  Paranoia is a good thing.  I don't like it in the Becker top.  I don't like it in my house.  It's better to be paranoid.  But I don't like it in my house anyway.  It's just bad, but I don't like it.  Right.  I used to leave it outside on the rocks in somebody else's garage.  Then I would go over there and do a bump and go back upstairs.  So, this one night I got upstairs and the page is going off and it's safe.  And I said, fuck it.  Let me just bring the two ounces to the house and blow. 
[00:25:30]  And I brought, at that time, it was like an ounce and a half and three quarters.  This bitch picked me up at six in the morning with a case of Starbucks coffee in Canada,  half a gallon of vodka.  And we went back to the house and we did that whole package of blow.  Heroin, Valiums, MDMA, GSP.  How many days?  How many days?  Two days.  Just two days.  Monday afternoon, I had to get Scott Wolf, Josh Wolf's brother, Fredo, to come get me 
[00:26:00]  over by the Director's Guild.  Oh, my God.  For two days.  I puked till Thursday.  Jesus Christ.  Here's how sick I was.  The fucking Houstons kept calling me.  And I'm like, fuck you, motherfuckers.  I'm out of commission, right?  So finally, that next week was the Grammys.  This is the last time I've seen them.  I don't think I told you about this.  This better be true, by the way.  He's really going off.  I get a call on a Monday morning.  It gets better right here.  He's at nine in the morning.  And they're like, is your boy up?  He'd have to be.  Come get me.  And they pull up to my fucking house, where I live, by the YMCA. 
[00:26:30]  And it was the manager, Whitney Houston, and Ricky Martin in the fucking back.  And they're all going.  They're going from the Grammys.  That jaw, all them jaws are fucking going, Jack.  And I get in the car with them.  I drive to the Martell cartel.  I'm sitting there like I don't even know it's Ricky Martin.  I just looked out the window.  I was more paranoid than he was.  I got in, bought it, brought it back to the car.  That's the last time I've fucking seen them.  Wow.  They went out of town.  They were here to sing.  What year is this? 
[00:27:00]  It had to be 98, 97, 99.  They were doing the soundtrack to James Bond.  You should probably not fucking start defamation suits.  That's defamation suits.  Ricky fucking water.  It's a true story.  If it didn't fucking happen, then it wouldn't give a fuck.  Well, Ricky Martin's clean his stove, but now he came out of the closet.  He's got kids.  These opinions and stories are not representative of the Joe Rogan story.  What is this?  Law and Order?  What the fuck is this?  No, I was actually promoting copyrighted stuff.  What is this? 
[00:27:30]  You know, Law and Order, this story might think that you might know these individuals.  They ain't the fucking people.  You know, this story's going to get on the internet now.  You know, I've never played the brain improv.  You know, I've never played the brain improv.  You know, 11 years ago, what are you going to say to me?  No, you remember me, bitch?  Oh, I remember me.  What the fuck?  Sing, bitch.  Sing.  I kept her alive for three fucking months, giving her those rocks.  God damn.  Rocks and shit.  So you think it was just them doing that amount?  Joe Rogan, you could go crazy.  You got a chick that's sucking your dick.  I got no experience with this cooking. 
[00:28:00]  Zero.  Wow.  And there you go.  Wow.  That's, yeah.  People get a hold of that one.  There you go.  That's going to be a story.  It's already making the rounds, bud.  Is it?  Yeah.  He tells a hell of a story, that Joey Diaz, huh?  Wow.  He doesn't give a shit either.  No.  He says names, places, times.  Yeah.  That's what he said on Joe Rogan's podcast.  We don't know.  Joe Rogan experience.  It's obvious Joe got a little nervous because there's a drastic cut, and they went back to 
[00:28:30]  this story to make sure, look.  Yeah.  You know.  Hey, hey.  This is what you're saying.  This is you, not me.  Right, right.  Although that doesn't cover it, to tell you the truth.  Wow.  I don't know.  I don't even know if us rebroadcasting it protects us.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I don't fucking know.  Nah, we're just reporting.  It's everywhere.  We report.  You decide.  It's online.  It's everywhere.  Of course it is.  That was pretty cool.  I also like the fact that Doug Stanhope had two hands going with shit he's smoking in 
[00:29:00]  two hands.  I know.  And then whoever's putting the podcast together, like directing it, is so fucked up that the  little window, the picture-in-picture, was going around the screen.  They couldn't decide where to put it.  Yeah.  He's trying to figure out exactly.  It's hilarious.  Can I place it here?  No.  Damn it.  That's right over Joe Rogan's face.  It is a good podcast.  Absolutely.  Joe Rogan rules.  He absolutely rules.  We know that.  What are they, taking Fear Factor off the air?  Rogan was tweeting yesterday about that. 
[00:29:30]  I think NBC's pulling it.  Really?  He was like, if you like the show, let NBC know.  And then afterwards, he was just kind of like, I think that was it.  Wow.  That sucks.  It's a weird time with sensational kind of shows like that, like eating stuff.  Because people see it all the time on the internet.  Nothing is really shocking anymore.  We talk about this a lot, but something like Fear Factor, when it was originally on, the 
[00:30:00]  internet wasn't so ingrained in our daily life.  And it was kind of outrageous.  All right, they're eating fucking bull testicles and shit.  They're eating fucking chicken faces.  I think it's still outrageous.  Oh, it is.  But as far as people seeking it out and going, holy shit, did you see that?  Right.  I don't think you have that whole thing anymore.  Well, lucky us, though.  There's another survivor coming out.  I'm amazed that show is still on the air. 
[00:30:30]  I'm amazed.  The show itself has become like people that are famous, and then they stay famous, even  though they haven't done anything.  Right.  It's like just the name is famous, so they keep putting it on.  Well, there's been too many survivors now.  Most of those people aren't famous.  No.  No.  You can name maybe five people that ever were on Survivor, if you think about it.  The show's name.  Johnny Fairplay!  The show's name is famous.  Shout out to Johnny Fairplay!  See?  But, I mean, the show doesn't even change.  They do the same shit. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  They try to change it up a little bit, but you really can't.  The Immunity Idol.  No.  Oh, you get the Immunity Idol.  No, no, thank you.  No, I'm done.  I haven't.  I think I watched season one.  That was it?  And then I was done.  I mean, that was probably 30 years ago.  I don't even know.  I made it to Johnny Fairplay.  I made it to that other guy, the fucking Ruben guy.  Ruben Stutter?  No, Ruben Stutter was the...  I know.  Oh, okay.  I think his name was Ruben, right? 
[00:31:30]  With the tie-dyes and the beard.  Yeah.  And I think that's about it.  I can't...  That was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I haven't watched easily in seven years.  Since we've been back on radio, I haven't watched one season of that.  Yeah.  There's no reason to.  So, everyone talking about the Whitney Houston, we'll certainly find out more.  I was surprised, though, watching the Grammys, that there wasn't more mentions of her from  the people at the podium getting their awards from some of the artists before or after they 
[00:32:00]  were done singing.  No, why?  Why?  Because in the end, it's all about me.  It's all about me.  Well, I'm wondering if the people were kind of told, look, we're handling this thing with  the tributes, and we have a couple of people that are going to say something, but if this  turns into a Whitney Houston memorial every time you get up to the podium for something,  it's going to seem a little off.  So, why don't we just get up, read the prompter, and do things? 
[00:32:30]  I'm thinking someone told everybody to...  Because even when it's about me, me, me, you want to say something so people go, oh,  wow, did you hear what they said about Whitney last night on the awards show?  So, it becomes about them anyway, but I'm starting to think, maybe it'll come out in  the news or something, that people were told to maybe keep it down.  You know what?  They hosed everything down and moved on with the show.  They did a Disney move.  Well, LL came out, gave his little prayer, gave his little opening, and then said... 
[00:33:00]  With his dry lips?  Oh, God, he's constantly licking those lips.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick my lips.  But he came out, and then he's like, you know, but, hey, we're here to party, and remember.  After his prayer, assuming everyone is into the Jesus.  Jesus.  I guess we should play the prayer.  We're going to do...  We should take a break before we really get into the Grammys, because we've got some shit  to say about that today.  But you want to hear the prayer from LL?  Who wouldn't?  LL starts the Grammys with a prayer for Whitney.  LL. 
[00:33:30]  There is no way around this.  We've had a death in our family.  And so, at least for me...  Condolences to the Cool Jays.  Death in the family, really?  What are you...  What?  Half these people fucking didn't reach out to Whitney.  Oh, please, family.  Are you kidding me?  If it was family, maybe you would have gone in and said something, or, you know...  I'm sure enough did, but...  Oh, yeah?  You know, family?  You guys aren't family? 
[00:34:00]  We are fam.  You'd rip each other's eyes out to get on stage.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a vicious business.  You would push people down in their seat.  Vicious.  The only thing that feels right is to begin with a prayer.  Prayer.  For a woman who we loved, for our fallen sister, Whitney Houston.  Whitney Houston.  Oh, yeah.  Heavenly Father, we thank you for sharing our sister, Whitney, with us. 
[00:34:30]  Today, our thoughts are with her mother, her daughter, and all of her loved ones.  And although she is gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit.  Do you think God watches or TVRs?  And to have a lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever.  Sunday, day of rest.  Amen.  Let's rest it.  Let's do some of that resting on Sundays.  You don't think he was watching Walking Dead or something?  He might have taken a peek at The Walking Dead just to make sure the zombies are not getting too crazy. 
[00:35:00]  Because LL used that forum to just talk right to God.  Yeah.  And he was looking in the camera.  I thought maybe, you know, he found out.  He got a little inside info that God was watching.  You mentioned Gwad.  Gwad.  Gwad without playing your Gwad clip.  I know.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of God.  Gwad.  The word of Gwad.  It's Rupert.  Thank you.  Pupkin?  Vincent Bayonne. 
[00:35:30]  I was saying Rubin.  Ah.  Tie-dye guy was Rupert.  Yeah, I got you.  I got you.  I'm with you.  Oh, of course.  I'm right there.  That guy.  With the beard.  Whoa.  I think that might be the last time I watched.  Man, is he a wrestler?  You don't remember him?  He was fucking huge, man.  They really tried to, you know, figure out something for him after the show ended, but  it never really turned out for him.  Tried to make something out of him?  Yeah.  Who's, uh...  They brought him back a couple times, and that was about all they could do with him.  Who's gone on from Survivor to do stuff? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, you got that bitch on The View.  The bitch on The View.  Who used to be so fucking adorable and hot and...  Was the host a Top Shot on Survivor?  What?  Was that a Survivor guy?  I don't know.  I'm trying to think.  Let me see.  Let me see.  I know he was a reality guy, right?  Oh, was it, uh...  Uh...  Kobe?  Yeah, I think so, right?  Yeah, Kobe was in, uh, season two.  Yeah, yeah.  I believe season two.  He's the host of Top Shot now.  He's a real tough guy. 
[00:36:30]  Real tough guy.  I think he was on with, uh, Elizabeth, uh, Hasselbeck.  Oh, really?  I do believe.  Well.  Yeah, he was definitely, uh...  He was definitely part of the Survivor thing.  Yeah, he's, uh...  Kobe.  He's doing well now.  Yep.  Yep.  With that, and, uh, Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Yep.  Is the gay guy still in prison?  Look how hot Elizabeth Hasselbeck used to be.  Aw.  No, that's shitty.  Aw.  That's a shitty one.  She looks wholesome in that one.  Yeah, get her where she's all anorexic.  With them abs. 
[00:37:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, she's fucking...  She's fucking dying of malnutrition there.  Nice, right?  That's a good look.  That's a good look.  Holy fuckaroni.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Uh, and...  God, how long ago was that?  And she plays...  She...  She's one...  Oh, man, that's good.  Right there.  Let me see that.  Do you like that she's one of you, Ant?  Well, that's not too bad.  What?  One of me?  Yeah, she's got that Republican...  No, she's one of these real right-wingers.  I'm not a right-winger. 
[00:37:30]  But she's not really informed.  I don't care if the gays fuck each other right there in front of me.  She does, though.  I'll pay for it.  She probably does, right?  Huh?  Uh, yeah, she has a big problem, I think, with that whole thing.  Really?  The conservatives, the religious right, the heavy conservative Republicans, they don't  want the gays doing anything.  Mm-hmm.  Except maybe leaving the planet.  Like me?  I don't care.  I don't care what the gays do.  I love that the gays want to get married and have that gay sex all over the place. 
[00:38:00]  Whatever.  Have fun.  Yeah, I'm with you.  But, uh, you know, so I'm not that crazy.  I just, I want to keep my money and I want to keep the government out of my fucking, uh,  out of my business.  You're more of a pick-and-choose guy, right?  That's what I am.  One from column A, one from column B.  I think, uh...  Just keep me out of column N.  I think in general Americans should be pick-and-choose.  I think we'd be way better off.  Exactly.  Enough with completely down party lines.  I like a la carte. 
[00:38:30]  You'll do a little a la carte?  I like doing a little a la carte.  Yes.  Do you do tapas?  Uh, no.  I think so.  The portions are awfully small.  Portions.  What a dumb idea.  We're going to give you something that's really delicious, but you can only have one spoonful.  Yeah.  What?  No, give me more of this.  I don't want to try more shit.  The fancier the restaurant, the smaller your portion is.  You could go to some shitty restaurant and get a pile of fucking cheap bad veal. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  You could pound that shit all day and it's not going to fucking get tender.  And then you can go to some fancy restaurant and they bring you a thimble of something.  So ridiculous.  I like when they bring a giant plate and it's got sauce smeared on the rim and different silverware for it.  And it's a little fucking thing.  They like to smear things on your plate.  This is a compliment from the kitchen.  A compliment.  A compliment.  Really?  You're like, oh, that's great.  Wow.  Thanks for the tablespoon of fucking goose liver shit. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, I hope I can fit what I ordered in after this.  Whoa.  Nothing worse.  And it has happened to us over the years where you go to a nice restaurant because someone  suggests it.  And on your way home, you're getting a slice of pizza because you're starving.  Still starving.  And you're looking at your bill.  Did I really spend this much and I'm still hungry?  It's like, oh, I'll have that.  The filet looks, well, that sounds great.  I'll have that.  And they bring this piece of meat that it looks like a scallop.  Right.  It's as big as a scallop.  Right.  How about this one? 
[00:40:00]  You order like, I don't know, a pork chop, let's say.  Ah.  And like, what does this come with?  Nothing.  No.  Well, when I grew up, my food came with something.  Oh, no, you got to order that separate.  Order it separate from the sides menu.  Right.  Who came up with the sides menu?  What a scam everything is.  It's just a fucking scam.  It's unbelievable.  And the fancier the place, the more they just fuck you, as far as that goes.  Right.  I like a good wooden bench family-style dining where they just ladle it out like prison. 
[00:40:30]  You know what?  Those places are so much better.  Oh, yeah.  They know how to fucking feed you.  Yeah.  You leave there going, holy fuck, I'm going to vomit.  Imagine you growing up, your mom's cooking you dinner.  You go, what are we having with the steak tonight?  Oh, you'll love it.  Oh, you wanted sides with the steak?  Oh, I didn't know.  No, we're just having, imagine like the mom from the generations we grew up, you know,  children of the 80s. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Bringing over.  Sam.  Oh, what the fuck is wrong with you?  What?  Will you accept there were children of the 80s?  Enough of this shit, Sam.  No, I won't accept that you're children of the 80s.  I was born in 1983 and the age difference between you two and me is dramatic.  Oh, it's not.  Would you accept if you were a teenager in the 80s if you're a child of the 80s?  Mm-hmm.  No, you have to be a teenager for the majority of the 80s.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's not called child of the majority of the 80s.  Right.  It's called child of the 80s. 
[00:41:30]  I was officially a child of the 80s.  No, the name implies that your childhood took place during the 1980s, which was not  the case for either of you.  If you're a teen in the 80s, you're a child of the 80s.  You're a child of the 80s.  At any point.  That's right.  That's how it works.  Child of the 80s, motherfucker.  And I would suggest you're still a child right up until the time you turned 20.  You think that's where the childhood ends?  Yeah, so at the teenage years end, I think you officially become a child.  As long as you're allowed on Sugar Mountain.  Right.  You can't be 20! 
[00:42:00]  Oh, Sugar Mountain!  Is that Whitney?  All right, what were you saying?  I'm sorry.  But he rolled his fucking eyes, this idiot.  I know.  He's an eye-rolling motherfucker over there.  If mom brought over a little fucking thimble of something and put that plate in front of  Pops, it would have been...  Although at my house, even a nice full plate of spaghetti got thrown against the wall.  But imagine that plate.  It wouldn't have been as dramatic and wouldn't have affected me so much if it was a tiny little 
[00:42:30]  Dixie cup full of pasta that hit the wall.  Well, what do you say?  What's this shit?  Yeah.  What the fuck am I supposed to do with this shit?  What's this shit?  Oh, Joey.  That's how they serve in the fancy restaurants.  Fuck the fancy restaurants.  I don't need this shit.  Stop fighting!  Stop fighting!  Shut up, you little faggot!  What are you, a faggot?  Joey, don't call him that.  Ah, fuck you. 
[00:43:00]  Oh.  Did I go off on a tear?  A little bit.  All we had growing up was sides because we were poor.  Ah, it was all cheese and fucking...  Yeah, it's because the meat was too expensive.  Right.  So we got a small piece of meat.  Yeah.  And then it was all about the sides.  Yeah.  As much carbohydrates as you can put in your little body.  Oh, it was like a Japanese prisoner of war camp.  Yeah, macaroni and cheese.  The portions.  Mashed potatoes.  Maybe a little rice.  A little rice.  Yes.  Yeah.  I remember some of the shit we used to get for dinner because it was like maybe it was 
[00:43:30]  getting to be the end of the month or something.  And it was really, we're having like scrambled eggs with some potatoes cut into it for dinner.  Were you a fan of breakfast for dinner?  Breakfast for dinner.  It's fun as a kid.  It's a trend, though.  Oh, it's breakfast for dinner.  This is fun.  We used to have...  It's like, oh, they're telling us it's fun because if you'd really think of why we're  having it, you'd cry.  I'd cry anyway.  Fucking French toast with Pepperidge Farm fucking bread and usually the ends. 
[00:44:00]  I think my mom figured out that they'd sold nothing but the ends.  Yeah.  I think you could get a loaf of just Pepperidge Farm ends and then she'd try to make that  into French toast.  Oh, how about the fact that there weren't enough hot dogs to give to all of us, so she'd just  cut them up in the pork and beans and then ladle it out.  Hey, we're having Franks and beans.  No, we're having a Frank and beans.  That's what we're eating.  You just assume someone else got there before you?  No.  Hey.  No, no.  No one really got the hot dogs.  Really just nothing. 
[00:44:30]  The Frankfurters.  Nothing in there.  Fuck, man.  Yeah.  So...  How about spaghetti without sauce?  It's just got the olive oil and some fucking salt and maybe some garlic powder on it.  I think we always had sauce.  No, sometimes you just fucking put the oil on it.  I don't understand any pasta dish that doesn't come with a red sauce.  Never understood it.  Yeah.  Is that an Italian thing?  I don't know.  What about a clam sauce?  Oh, the fucking linguine with white clam sauce. 
[00:45:00]  But you look at the menu and you're like, wow, this looks awesome.  And then you realize it's not a red sauce pasta dish?  Yeah.  What a waste of time.  How about ones that aren't sauces and they call it like that?  Oh, it's like a pasta with some kind of...  What is it?  Peas.  They call it.  And it's just like shit thrown on it.  Peas and a little ham.  It's vegetables.  It's dry.  Yeah.  Sauce has to be wet or it's not sauce.  I don't think I've ever had a pasta dish that didn't come with a red sauce.  Yeah.  I always say, no, thank you. 
[00:45:30]  I don't want it white.  What are you talking about?  Red.  And don't call sauce gravy, you dumb guinea.  I see it down here.  I'm reading it.  It's like gravy.  No, it's not called gravy.  Gravy is brown and made with like meat stock stuff.  I do like a good bolognese.  Yeah.  When I was in the Outer Banks, there was a whole bunch of us.  And this guy, he's a fan of the show and stuff.  He wanted to cook a nice traditional Italian meal for everybody. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, boy.  And he burnt the gravy after spending hours on it.  And I swear to you, I thought he was going to kill himself.  He was so bummed out.  Was he bummed?  And it tasted fine.  It's the one thing he's got to do and he fucks it up.  But he was so excited because he brags about his cooking and his heritage.  Oh, boy.  It was one of these guys.  He got the recipe from his grandma.  Oh, my grandma.  Passed down.  And we're in the Outer Banks.  And all of a sudden, I'm smelling burnt sauce. 
[00:46:30]  And this guy is losing his mind in the kitchen.  He's so bummed because he couldn't figure out, you know, I guess the stoves are different down  there, obviously.  So he fucked up.  Well, if it's bubbling like a cauldron, maybe he fucking turned the heat down.  Yeah, he was so devastated.  To this day, he wants, you know, a redo.  We haven't done the redo yet.  You had your chance.  He's like, you don't understand, you know, when it's done properly, it probably will be  the best sauce or gravy you ever had.  I've had it when it's done properly by people who know how to cook.  Hit the bricks.  Who can figure out that a stove is a stove. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Fucking Mario.  We should go to break because our food is here.  Yes, it is.  So Whitney, I don't know.  Some people say tragic, I guess.  Others say whatever.  Well, it could be expected and be tragic.  I just get mad because, you know, life gave her some shit, some good shit, and she just  fucking wasted it.  People will do that.  And I guess I'm supposed to have some sympathy, but I don't know, man. 
[00:47:30]  When you have someone like her where she had a million chances to try to figure it out,  and I know it's a disease, I've heard it over the years, but she had a lot of good people  behind her trying to really help her out, and I think part of it comes down to you.  You have to finally go, all right, I'm going to fucking lick this shit.  Yeah, you have to realize at some point, probably not in your best interest.  I don't know.  Maybe that's fucking callous on my part, but.  It probably is.  But you got Clive Owen and everybody reaching out to you, and, you know, I don't know. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  That's where I sit with this shit.  Hey, can we play Adele going into break?  Someone told me on Twitter, man, you make fun of everything.  You know, to just compliment, like, have a nice tweet is boring, I think.  Yeah.  Huh?  You have a performance.  Adele is amazing, because people are like, do you like anything?  Yeah, I like Adele.  I think her voice is completely ridiculous.  Well, tap that ass.  How about tapping that fat ass? 
[00:48:30]  I was bummed, and I'll say it again.  When I realized she wasn't a sexy black singer, I didn't like her songs as much.  But in the end, this chick could fucking sing.  And what, she had vocal cord surgery?  Oh, yeah.  She just blew out one of her vocal cords, man.  So how do they put that back together and make it sound exactly how she used to sound?  That doesn't make sense.  With lasers.  Something.  That's why I'm starting to believe that you got a soul.  Why?  Because how do you go in there and laser up that vocal cord and you sound exactly the same?  I don't know. 
[00:49:00]  Think about that.  I think they've come very far with fixing the vocal cords these days, getting some nodules off of them.  Where an athlete has a horrendous injury, and doctors have put them back together, and he plays just as well.  Yeah.  You would think, like, something would fucking not be right.  You would think.  But her voice sounds strong.  Was that her first performance since the surgery?  Her first televised performance.  I'm sure she's been in the studio making sure she can sing.  Can we play that Adele shit?  You got the performance on disc.  Adele. 
[00:49:30]  Unless you want to play the album track.  No, man.  She did all right last night.  Yeah, so for the people that ask, yeah, this is what I liked.  Adele was amazing.  All right, one thing.  Well, let me think.  And it's the one thing that everybody agrees on.  She won, like, six awards.  I think Travis said, he's like, you know, everyone live tweets the Grammys, you know?  Yeah.  And so much stuff that is so easy to make fun of.  And he said it this morning.  He goes, and then Adele hits that stage and opens up that voice of hers, and everyone stopped tweeting. 
[00:50:00]  And then everyone's like, I don't know, maybe I could do a fat joke.  But that's, like, basic shit.  Of course.  There's nothing you could say.  She's that damn good.  And she made all these pop singers look like idiots.  She was the big winner.  You think Lady Gaga on the end could sing that well, Sam?  Be honest.  With or without a fucking fishnet stocking over her face.  With or without her Halloween costume.  With or without the pinhead mask she was wearing.  Right.  What the fuck?  I tweeted, I took such great pleasure in the fact that she was sitting there in her Halloween costume for nothing in the end. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  She was barely even mentioned on the Grammys.  I know.  She mentioned her name.  Did she have a scepter also?  Yes.  What the fuck was that?  She had a man with her who had a scepter.  A man that had a scepter.  Really?  No one carries a scepter.  What's a scepter?  What is it even used for?  I thought we retired the scepter many years ago. 
[00:51:00]  The scepter is not something people carry around with them these days.  You think that's going to make a comeback?  No.  The scepter is done.  Let's go to the scepter store.  There isn't a scepter store.  Maybe we can find a scepter.  Ten scepter of Emporium.  A scepter.  You know what I liked about Adele?  No scepter?  Adele has this voice that I've never heard before.  This amazing voice.  I can't think of anyone that has had a voice like this. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe since Whitney Houston, I guess.  We're just so over the top and ridiculously good.  And then she gets up there to accept her award.  And she sounds like Julia Child.  Oh, this is wonderful.  I can't believe I won another award.  This is fabulous.  She talks like her teeth are rotting in front of her eyes.  She says with like whiff.  Whiff.  With everyone involved.  It's a lot.  I can't believe I won another award. 
[00:52:00]  And then she gets up and sings and the accent goes away.  It's been a thing with English people for years.  When they sing, a kind of wacky accent goes away.  It's probably one of the oldest jokes, but why don't they sing with that accent?  I don't know.  Even the Beatles were notorious for that one.  You'd listen to the songs and then.  You would swear they were from America.  Yeah.  But with that said, let's go to break with Adele doing Rolling in the Deep.  This fucking song.  Holy man.  Wow.  And she even said it.  She thanked radio because radio decided, you know, fuck putting this song in a genre. 
[00:52:30]  We're all playing this.  Crossover artist.  They call it a crossover head.  Crossover artist.  And she deserved that, man.  I have no problem admitting I like Adele.  Her shit is fucking dope, yo.  We could have had it all, rolling in the deep.  You have my heart inside of your hands. 
[00:53:00]  But you paid it, you paid it, you paid it, you paid it to do.  There's a fire starting in my heart.  Beeching my fever, bitch, and it's bringing me out the dark.  Oh, finally I can see you, Crystal, please.  Go ahead and tell me how that I'll lay your stuff, babe. 
[00:53:30]  See how I'll leave with every piece of you.  Don't underestimate the things that I will do.  There's a fire starting in my heart.  Reaching the fever, bitch, and it's bringing me out the dark.  The scars of your love remind me of us.  They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.  The scars of your love, they leave me friends. 
[00:54:00]  Just I can't help feeling it, we could have had it all.  You're rolling in the deep.  You have my heart inside of your head.  And baby, you paid it to the beat.  Baby, I've got no story to be told.  But I've heard what's on you, and I'm gonna make your head burn. 
[00:54:30]  Think of me in them depths of your despair.  Make a home down there if mine's so cliche.  The scars of your love remind me of us.  They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.  The scars of your love, they leave me friends.  Because I can't help feeling it, we could have had it all. 
[00:55:00]  You're rolling in the deep.  You have my heart inside of your head.  You paid it to the beat.  You could have had it all.  You're rolling in the deep.  You have my heart inside of your head. 
[00:55:30]  But you're painted with your feet.  And ready?  Throw your soul through every open door.  I'm sure you're blessed to find what you look for.  Turn my sorrow into treasure gold.  You paid me back in town and we just watched you stole.  And ready?  You gave me my heart inside of your head. 
[00:56:00]  You were dancing around.  It's over and out of your head.  You were dancing around.  You're dancing around.  You were dancing around.  We could have had it all  Oh, and then the team  You had my heart inside  Your hands  And you played it 
[00:56:30]  Could it be  You could have had it all  Oh, and then the team  You had my heart inside  And you played it  But you played it  You played it  You played me through the beat  3SXM 
[00:57:00]  The Opinetry Show  Get in topical 
[00:57:30]  Hold up, wait a minute  With the Sex Man  Good morning, sexy  Good morning  See, we're back to the obvious again  Yeah, we're getting topical  How were the Grammys for you?  Did you like watching last night?  I like McCartney ending it  Why?  He killed himself?  What?  Why did you like it? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, ending the show  It was better than most of the performances that were there  His first performance was horrible  That's true  What?  You don't like it?  That Valentine song?  My Valentine  Don't fucking play new shit if you're Paul McCartney  Sorry, no one wants to hear it  There's probably only a handful of guys that should never play new shit  Yeah  And Paul McCartney's one of them  And Bruce is another  You finally get to see Paul McCartney  You don't want to hear new shit  You don't want to hear ukulele shit  No  You want to hear yesterday  Exactly  Enough already  Please  You got that in your catalog 
[00:58:30]  Why are you playing my Valentine?  Oh, I just spit on you  No, you missed  Sorry about that  At least he didn't play the ukulele song  Although I would have wanted to hear that one before I heard that one last night  The dumb ukulele song  Well, what else did you like?  Uh, I don't know  I hated that Nicki Minaj set  Oh yeah, we'll get into Nicki Minaj  Will we?  Ooh  I'll tell you this much  I don't know  I don't know much of anything 
[00:59:00]  But I know this  Nicki Minaj stinks  Yeah  That is completely overrated  What was the point of her performance?  It started out as a thing  And then it became a movie for a little while  And then she was trying to get  Some shocking Lady Gaga  Slash Madonna  Slash we've seen this a million times  Shit together  Oh, is that what she was doing?  Yeah, she was hoping she'd be the headline today  Like, oh god  The Catholic Church is in and up  Over Nicki Minaj  Over what? 
[00:59:30]  Exactly  Didn't work  Yeah  Who cares?  And I don't give a fuck  She could, like, sing really fast  What does it mean in the end?  Who cares?  Anyway, getting topical with the sex man  Was that where we were?  Anthony said that you've decided to go back to real obvious shit  Back to basics  Yeah  So I will guess it's Black Sabbath denying using steroids to Congress four years ago  That was correct 
[01:00:00]  What?  Wait a minute  You got a couple  What?  Something got crossed there  Wait a minute  No, look  Black Sabbath denied using steroids to Congress four years ago  Not a typo  Yeah, I don't think that's the case  There you go  That's what it is today  I don't know why Congress gives a fuck that Black Sabbath was using steroids  I don't know that they were  No, they're influencing, you know, the children  The children?  I don't think they were either, though  I don't think they were  What?  I don't think they were either  No, let's keep it at that 
[01:00:30]  Alright  That's what happened, right, Iraq?  Yeah  What?  There you go  That's cool  There you go  That's cool  By the way, Blitzdog, and he spells the dog with the W and the G  77 writes, Lady Gaga  Because I was trying to figure this shit out, and he nailed it  Lady Gaga looked like a guppy caught in a net  That's beautiful  That's perfect  Yeah  That's a perfect tweet, sir  Perfect tweet  I don't know what the hell that whole thing was about  Well, it's a tension, I guess  She's trying to  I think the black veil, black net, but it looks like kind of a veil thing 
[01:01:00]  I think she was trying for a Whitney Houston  Like, look, Eric  Oh, really?  All you people are, like, celebrating tonight, but I'm in mourning for Whitney  So you think she was  Trying too hard?  Yes  Yeah  And by the way, I meant to say Clive Davis, I'm getting killed  I guess I said Clive Owen  Ah, Clive Owen, I didn't even notice  She hung out with a lot of actors, too  Yeah, yeah  Clive Owen  You know, Clive, Clive Davis had his big, you know, pre-Grammy party 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  And I don't know why we didn't notice this about Tony Bennett until recently  He's a lunatic  Tony Bennett  I'm crazy  He is fucking crazy  Wow, she does look like a guppy caught in a net  That's perfect  She looks like the worst bank robber  Using, like, fishnet stocking instead of nylon  Yeah  Ah, boy 
[01:02:00]  Do you think she ever gets embarrassed?  She's starting to become kind of a joke, I'm thinking  She walks in with these ridiculous outfits  And people are like, really?  Can you just take your fucking seat?  She's wearing a gill net  Yeah  Yeah  What does that mean?  Is there a statement there that we don't even know yet?  Yeah  You may be right on with the Whitney Houston thing  Because if she's wearing black  She's mourning  She may be  This may be her  Her mourning outfit  You think she can change outfits that quickly? 
[01:02:30]  You know, a change of plans like that?  24 hour notice?  It's mourning chic  Oh  Anyway, Tony Bennett  You know, he said a lot about 9-11 there  Yeah  So at the Clive Davis party  Owen  They're doing a big tribute to, you know, Whitney Houston  Yeah  Because it was supposed to be this big, huge, let's have fun party  And then it turned into, fuck, Whitney died  So  Yeah  He gets up there and he goes, I'd like every person in this room to campaign to legalize drugs 
[01:03:00]  What the fuck is that about?  By the way, that's an exact quote  What would that do?  I don't know  Would that help his dead friend?  It seems like the legalized drugs might have got her  Yeah, yeah  The legal, it seems like the ones that are legal  Right  I think we might have to control the legalized drugs a little more there, Tony  That motherfucker be nuts  He is a little nuts, right?  I guess Nicolas Cage is here  Ooh 
[01:03:30]  Apparently  There's a big to-do because he came early and Roland's in a panic  Actor  Actor extraordinaire  Actor  Ghost Rider  Spirit of Vengeance in theaters Friday  Yeah  He's going to be all on fire and stuff  How did that Star Wars movie do?  3D  How did it do?  I mean, it did  That's the Jar Jar Binks one, right?  Yes  In 3D, huh?  Yeah  Where is the box office?  Star Wars Episode I in 3D, $23 million 
[01:04:00]  Is that good, you think?  I think they wanted more than that  For a re-release?  I mean, yeah  That everyone has seen in 3D  But for a 3D movie, that's not good because the ticket sales are higher  Generally, people release things in 3D so they can get a little more cake  You got the big brain on you, Sam  Whoa  Right  Right  I didn't think that  So, it's not that great  But also, it's easily the worst Star Wars movie  Yeah  Well, The Rock beat him out  Journey to the Mysterious Island 
[01:04:30]  Yes  The Rock and his pecs  Yes  You see his pecs where he's bouncing shit off them?  Hell yeah  And why the fuck did he blow off our show?  He blew off radio as a medium  Yeah, he's done with radio  Thanks, Rock  Just when we thought we were back on good terms  Fuck The Rock  Didn't we tell him he was going to just not be on our show anymore?  Yeah, of course we did  When he did his first movie  Of course  Well, you said you were going to be big  Alright, you don't have to bring that up  Well, you said you don't have to bring up the fact that during the day when we had our problems with The Rock, I did say that we would be much bigger and have a much better career than him 
[01:05:00]  How's that working?  Not so good, Ed  Not only are we not  He now blows off our medium  Yeah  Because he doesn't even acknowledge that it's in entertainment  So I would say it didn't pan out the way I thought  Hey, this latest movie, better or worse than the one where Hulk Hogan wears a tutu?  Oh, good question, Ed  So far, better, I would say 
[01:05:30]  Yeah?  Check Rotten Tomatoes  In your opinion?  I haven't seen it, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this one's better than Mr. Nanny  Mr. Nanny, that was it  Mr. Nanny  Which came off of Suburban Commando  Yeah  Ah  They got like a teenage girl on this journey, too  That is a bit juicy  Yeah  They like to call it juicy when it's Vanessa Hutchins  What do you mean juicy?  Is that who that was?  I know she's in the movie  Man, I gotta pay closer attention  Who is it?  She looks damn good in the movie 
[01:06:00]  Vanessa Hutchins  Oh, wow, so she's playing young?  Because then she's a bit older now  A little bit  Is she?  Yeah  Let's see  Yeah, she looks fucking good in this movie  Yeah, that chick's kind of fine  She's got like the halter top look going on  Oh, shit  So you see some movies  One of these nude shots  That's her?  Yes  Oh, that was the one where she was naked a few years back  That's right  Oh, man  She's in the Rock movie?  Yeah, yes  Look at her hairy muff 
[01:06:30]  And you like that it?  I don't mind it  I'd shove my face in that  It's like a 5 o'clock shadow, though, man  Yeah, it is  It's kind of like a yabba-dabba-doo  Kind of a thing she got going there  No, that's kind of cool  It looks  Wouldn't that be like kissing a guy?  No, it's a vagina  Yeah, but it's got a 5 o'clock shadow  You'd be beer rubbing  No  As you licked a little tongue  Kissing a guy 
[01:07:00]  That's pretty funny  But it's that hairy down there  Oh, come on, man  Why?  What happened?  Hey, Nick  Come on down, brother  Why is he listening in our office?  Now it's awkward for everybody  It's uncensored radio  So we say what we want  Sorry, Nick  That you had to hear that  I hear he's here with his family  Now we're finding out he's listening to our show down there  Why would it be on like that?  Because we kind of adjust for guests, you know?  We certainly do  You know  I didn't want to talk about 
[01:07:30]  Nick Cage is in our office listening  I didn't want to talk about, you know  Safe House did well this weekend  And, I don't know, The Vow  I guess, what?  Oh, yeah  Is that a state movie?  Fucking Rachel McAdams  Huh?  It's the same movie  Again, Rachel McAdams from The Notebook  In a movie where she's in love with somebody  But can't remember nothing  Yes  It's the same shit  I hear they really romanticize this one  Because the real story  It didn't end up this well  Oh  No  What happens when love conquers her? 
[01:08:00]  In the...  Ugh, I hate those trailers for these rom-coms  Didn't they do this movie a lot?  Like, first 50 dates  Yeah  Yeah, right  This one is 51st dates  Ain't that it?  Whatever the heck  Heck, then  See, now I'm saying heck  Because Nick Cage is listening in our office  Heck  It's even the same writer as The Notebook  Like, it's the same movie  Except she can't remember when she's young instead of old  Let me guess  She remembers in the end  There's like some kind of spark where he goes  Oh my god  It's either that or she falls in love all over again  See, now he's gonna think we're shock jocks 
[01:08:30]  Would you fall in love with your ex all over again, Ed?  Man  If you had some of that amnesia  It would take more than amnesia  It would take a full frontal lobotomy  And then I'd still sense something was amiss  How do you fall in love with someone again?  I could be like  I could absolutely be  Like Charlton Heston's friend  His  The guy that was on the mission with him  Yeah  In Planet of the Apes  Yeah, okay  With my head 
[01:09:00]  You cut out his brain, you bloody baboon  But  Somehow you would still remember  Somehow I'd look and go like  There'd be some memory of the misery  That I went through  Just somewhere deep in your DNA  You just know something's not right  Something  Yes  Even though you don't have a brain  It becomes ingrained in just your being  The mind doesn't even need it  It's like a reflex  It goes from the spinal cord  It's like a jellyfish  Just  Yeah 
[01:09:30]  Just reacting  It becomes instinct  Yeah  It's like  You know when something's instinctive  It doesn't have to be taught  It just is there  That's funny, man  That's what it would be  There's no way  I could have enough amnesia  Right  To go back with my ex  That's really funny  Yuck  Breaking news  Nick Cage is not in our office listening  So why were we told he was?  Because we originally were told he was  By who?  Well, I guess it was  Roland told Travis  And Travis told me  But now we're being told  That he's in the green room 
[01:10:00]  Who is responsible?  And he's getting his breakfast  Who is responsible for that false alarm?  So do we need him on the show now or later?  Nick Cage is here  In our office  He's in the other green room  We don't have an other green room  The one in the lobby  Oh, the important people one  Yes  He may or may not be listening to the show  Okay  Unconfirmed  Okay, sir  They don't play our show in that green room  They're able to  I doubt they are  They are  It's too close to Howard's area  I don't think they play us 
[01:10:30]  They wouldn't want to  They don't want to  Have Howard bothered  It's right next to the door  To the magical studios of the Stern show  Howard's on vacation?  I've just been told  Yeah, he's off this week  He's off this week  How is that possible?  He's got to do  America's Got Talent  That rule  He makes a quarter  Fucking billion dollars  He did three weeks  He's got  He's on vacation  He's got another job  He's got to do  Do you realize  I haven't been on vacation  Since it was warm?  He's not on vacation  He's working his other job  He's on vacation? 
[01:11:00]  He's got two jobs  How can he not do  A show after the Grammys?  No, I'm just talking about  Hoodie footie reads  He's got another job  To worry about  Oh, oh  And to the people  How does that pay?  And to the people  That are wondering  Yeah, I'm fucking jealous  Yeah, of course  How the fuck is he on vacation again?  Get another job  And he was just on vacation  Who wouldn't love that gig?  He's got to do his other job  Oh, Scott Greenstein is a dummy  I would love to have  That much vacation time  And still make that much money 
[01:11:30]  It's like  It's like he just  He ruled  This place  You're forgetting  Three days a week  Yeah  Why would you bring that up?  See, if I worked  Three days a week  I wouldn't need a vacation  Yeah  Because you would have  A vacation every week  But he's got a side gig  You forget  Holy fuck  Side gig  Oh, man  Did he just walk  All over this fucking company?  Oh, yeah  Good for him  Nicholas Cage  He'll be in here  In 12 minutes  12 minutes  What are we supposed to do 
[01:12:00]  For 12 minutes, Sam?  We're not that good  Yes, you are  We're good  But we're not that good  You're so good  Well  We could start  With some Grammy talk  And then we  Do a little Nick Cage  And then we go back  To Grammy talk  Sure  And set it  Correctly  Before the show  Oh, man  I'm just worried  About the triangle  Why?  There's too much  Going on down there  Nah, that's pretty cool  Being a fucking child  Of the 80s  I remember that shit  Clear as day  Dude, you wouldn't 
[01:12:30]  That's too much  If you just opened the door  Right?  To that room  You open the door  And it's like  Oh, well  I'm sorry  I opened the door  What do we got here?  Well  What are we here?  I was  You wouldn't be like  Your eyes go right down to that  Of course  And it's like  Oh, I gotta have me some  Of course  Yeah  But in a perfect world  You'd want that cleaned up  A little bit more  Nah, I think it's okay  There's nothing wrong with that  I mean, yeah  Cleaned up  That  Shaved off  I don't give a shit  But sometimes  That's fine 
[01:13:00]  Yep  That's fine right there  Yep  Yep  You know?  You're not feeling it?  Nah, it's  It's  She was in here last week  Was she really?  Oh, yeah  That's  She's in Journey 2  Really?  Oh, yeah  God  How old is she?  At this point  Because they make her look like  She's really young in that movie  Oh, well  She's like 19 or 20 at this point?  Yeah  Probably  Yeah  19  Alright, listen  Anne said it correctly  If you're gonna be  If you're Bruce Springsteen 
[01:13:30]  How about you sing something we all know?  Fuck the new shit  Born to run, motherfucker  He started the Grammys broadcast  Basically by asking if everyone's alive out there  Or who's alive out there  Which is kind of awkward  Because everyone's thinking about Whitney Houston  Oh, yeah  And they're all staring at the empty seat  Oh, boy  Fucking Bruce Springsteen has to start his performance with  Who's alive out there  Who's alive out there?  Oh, boy  Bit out of touch, don't you think?  Yeah 
[01:14:00]  And what did you think of the new song?  I thought nothing of it  It was there  Because he's in the Paul McCartney category  If you're Bruce Springsteen  Enough with the new shit  Right  Of course, Roland would completely disagree  But enough  Of course he would  You've got too much cool shit you could be playing  I know  I don't  I don't understand why you wouldn't play  Something that everybody knows  Everybody  You have a worldwide audience there  Play something everyone knows  What was the name of the song? 
[01:14:30]  Couldn't tell you  Was it We Take Care of Our Own?  Was it the new single?  Is that it?  And when did Kathy Griffin join the band?  Oh, boy  She's not in that band  What?  Who was that redhead?  Oh, boy  I don't think it was Kathy Griffin  I'm almost sure  Was the song about how he's getting older  But he still rocks?  God, do I hate that  We're getting older  But we still rock musicians  Van Halen  Fucking twisted  People are liking the new Van Halen album  They all have those songs, though  It's like, oh, look at us 
[01:15:00]  Bruce looks great, though  He looks exactly the same  Yeah  Guy hasn't aged in, I don't know, 15 years  What was that new song there, Travis?  What?  I don't know what you're talking about  Bruce Springsteen  Or do we have a Nick Cage update?  Yeah, we have a Nick Cage update  Are we allowed to say Nick or Nicholas?  I would say Nicholas  It's formal  I want to feel like a gnome  Hey, Nick  So, uh  Let's talk here about Valley Girl  Yeah, it's called  We Take Care of Our Own  But, um  Roland is asking  If we can bring  Nicholas Cage back now  What happened to the 12 minutes? 
[01:15:30]  He said he's ready now  You do one minute of Grammy talk  What the hell's going on here?  You keep trying to do a show  And it keeps being foreboding  Yeah  Forbottom  Sure  Yeah, yeah  Bring him in  You hear that, Roland?  What are we waiting for?  Where is he?  He's in the green room  Well, now Roland  I see Roland leaving the office  To go get him  So that's another three minutes  Oh my God  Do we have time to take a quick break?  No  And do some live reads?  No  I don't think so  What if we do a single?  I don't think so  No, even with the live reads  It'll end up being  And then it'll be awkward 
[01:16:00]  We're in a break  He's standing there  He's standing outside  Do you like that Bruce Springsteen  Opened up the Grammys  With a brand new song  That really hasn't hit radio yet?  I didn't mind it  Because I've heard it  So many times  On commercials from this channel  Oh really?  I mean it's hit radio  As much as it's gonna hit radio  Yeah  I mean it's a good song  I understand that  These bands go on  And perform on the Grammys  To play new music  So I didn't mind it  Yeah, but the song just  I don't know if it's necessarily  The best thing to  Open a show with 
[01:16:30]  I mean  I like the Grammy performers  You know  Playing their big song  From the past year  But no one knows this song yet  It's bothersome  You're asking me to make sense  Of the Grammys  Like why would you wait  To do the Whitney Houston thing  At 10.45 on a Sunday night  And because of rules  We might have Bruce Springsteen  Take us  But we're not sure yet  How does that work?  Now we gotta give him away right now  Well, let's interview Nicolas Cage  But I didn't understand  What you were trying to tell me  Yeah, I didn't understand the rules  We might have him 
[01:17:00]  But we can't really promote  That we have him  Don't say that shit  Don't say that shit  So that means we don't have him  He's coming  Alright, we'll figure out  The Bruce Springsteen ticket  Let's take a celebrity  Stop saying that  A second  Hey, there he is  Oh my god  Jesus  Alright  Nicolas Cage  How are you, sir?  How you doing, man?  Take a seat  Make yourself at home  There you go  Talking about the Grammys  Yeah, we were just  Kind of yapping about it  I didn't see any of it  So I'm the last guy to ask  No, we're just saying  You're a guy  That likes music, though, right?  Sure, of course  Rock, right? 
[01:17:30]  You're kind of a rock guy?  Pretty eclectic  Yeah, we're actually on  So pull the mic up a little bit  We're on right now?  Yeah, we just do that  Oh, good, oh, good  We just, like, pop right on  Nice to know  Yeah, yeah  Figured I'd let you know  What do you mean by eclectic?  What do you like?  What I mean is  I like a little bit of everything, actually  Jazz, predominantly classical  But I love 50s, 60s, 70s rock  Yeah  The stuff you heard on the radio  A million times, or? 
[01:18:00]  No, I tend to  I'll look around  I'll go into iTunes  And find things  And then  They have that beautiful thing  Called Genius  And then they give me recommendations  Right, right  I just found a band called  Kasabian  Which I like  Out of England  And then also  I'm a big fan of  Filter  Oh, wow  They really did  Some amazing stuff  Yeah, yeah  Absolutely  You keep tabs on  Still what's going on  In music these days?  Or you kind of  Fall off a little bit?  I, you know  I went to the Met  Just the other day 
[01:18:30]  And I sat through  Six hours of  Go to Damarung  Partner Opera  By myself  Jesus  And it was interesting  Because I'm walking  Through the lobby  And this woman  Looks at me  And goes  Well, what's a Hollywood  Thing like you  Doing at the Met  And I went  Wow  That's not very nice  Yeah, is that supposed  To be a compliment?  No  I said  Can an actor  Enjoy a bit of opera?  Yeah  And she's like  Well, you're the only one  And I said  Well, I'm the first  There's a first time  For everything  And then she said 
[01:19:00]  Well, you must be  From Europe  What the hell is  Wow, this is sort of like  You're segregating me  Yeah  From Hollywood  Well, I guess the  You know, the  Perception is that  You know, you're much too  Hollywood people  Much too shallow  To enjoy something like that  I guess  Yeah  I can't do opera  You can't do it?  No  You have to  I just can't do it  I understand  I'll go classical  I'll do a few different genres  But opera's rough for me, man  You have to really hang with it  Until it  Once  You've got to spend 
[01:19:30]  Like a couple hours with it  And then you get into it  But I understand  It is hard to get  I went once  And they actually have  Like the subtitles  In front of you  On the seat  Which is great  If you need to understand  The story  Which is great  It's like  Yeah  Because I don't know  Italian  No  You know  No, it really helps  Because then you can  Understand the show  Yeah  And that's what helps  You get into it  Okay, yeah  Because I don't know  What the heck's going on  Man  It seems like  One long drawn out song  Yeah  It's someone with a Viking hat  But if you look at it carefully  I mean  It's amazing  How much 
[01:20:00]  Has been influenced by it  Like John Williams  Right  Tolkien  The Lord of the Rings  All of it comes out  Of those Wagner operas  Yeah  It's the source  So if you go into it  Knowing that  You know you're going into  Like the cell  You know, the root  It is  When you watch it  Especially at the Met  They put on amazing shows there  These stage sets  Are astounding  That thing  That's on the stage  Which is like  A series of miniature monoliths 
[01:20:30]  From 2001  It cost like  25 million dollars  It's amazing  Then they had to spend  Another 16 million  Because it was too heavy  For the stage  To reinforce the stage  It's like  Is opera really doing this?  Well  Yeah  Who's paying for this?  Things are on elevators  And they're going up and down  And moving  It's astounding  What's going on in that place  It really was extraordinary  But yeah  No, that's what I mean  By eclectic  And I do like rock music  Very much so  Well, rock's gone away  Yeah, it's hard to find  Any good new rock 
[01:21:00]  It's pretty sad  Well, U2  Just is enormously confident  Always  Yeah, yeah  I've always loved U2  That's for sure  To this day  Really quick about opera  When do you know  When you've seen a bad opera?  When you're just  Completely bored  Out of your mind  Sitting there  Don't care about the show  But I love the orchestral music as well  So I'm very familiar with it  So it's very hard for me  To be bored with a Wagner opera 
[01:21:30]  Fair enough  It is interesting how music like that  Especially when you're watching a show  And it builds  Could just give you goosebumps  I was crying  Really?  I was literally by myself  I'm probably the only guy  That listens to opera  And actually starts crying  But when Siegfried dies  He's the most tragic character  In the history of that  Spoiler a little  You know  And then the effects  Where his blood goes into the water  And it's all on the stage  And then the music  I know it  So it's  I got very emotional  But  Which I was trying to quickly  Like dry my eyes 
[01:22:00]  So no one could see me crying  Was the stuffy old broad  Giving you crap about that too?  A Hollywood man like you  Weeping at an opera?  Yeah, all by myself  Yeah, by yourself  It's strange  And from there  I went on Saturday Night Live  Right, right  Maybe it was tears of fear  But then I had to go live  In like 20 minutes  What an interesting evening you had  That's a great night  I don't know who goes from  Six hours of Wagner  Right into SNL  You actually have to sit there 
[01:22:30]  For six hours  Six hours  Wow  Wow  But I found it empowering  It was an amazing experience  As long as I've sat for anything  Maybe three  Imagine having to  You know  Yeah  Had SNL tree  Great  Yeah  Great  Yeah  They've done some  They've done some parodies of you  On that show before  Hilarious  Oh yeah  Yeah  You've been parodied a lot  Yes  By people and stuff  How do you feel about that?  Do you like it?  I have to go with the adage  That any form of imitation  Is flattering  Yeah 
[01:23:00]  Otherwise  I'm going to be in hell  So I'm going to go with that  Everybody  Everybody that does an imitation of you  Always does the over the top  Right  Nick Cage kind of character  That you've portrayed in a few movies  I find him very funny  And kind of  Yeah  You know  Accurate in a way  Well the thing is that  Sandberg has made it his own  Yeah  He has a very abstract impression of me  Right  You just let him do it  You know  It's not exactly me  But it's wonderful in its own right  So  Yeah  Yeah sometimes it doesn't have to be  An accurate portrayal 
[01:23:30]  But there's a piece of it  That is  Is kind of accurate  And it  It makes the whole thing work  I think so  Yeah  Yeah  So  New movie  Ghost Rider  Spirit of Vengeance  Yeah Spirit of Vengeance  Now  You've been a part of a couple of  Like franchises  Haven't you?  This is the second one  The other one is  National Treasure  National Treasure  Which all of them do very well man  Well thanks  They're cool movies  I like that whole  Puzzle kind of a thing 
[01:24:00]  Yeah  But what I like about Spirit of Vengeance  Is just how pop art the movie is  It really does feel like you're reading a comic book  Yeah  There's a quality to it  That it's just a little bit abstract  A little bit artificial  And then real  But it mixes it all up  And it's pretty gutsy for a studio  To make a movie that's this psychedelic  Yeah  It is cool  You're doing something with a comic book character  Because you can kind of go off a reality 
[01:24:30]  And people won't go like  Oh that can't happen  It's like hey it's a comic book  Yeah exactly  Look my face is on fire  Right  Come on  And that provides a context  Where I can go as abstract as I want  Go as outside the box as I want  When I'm acting  If I want to get really big  It's fine  Because look my head's on fire  And people say  Well I don't understand the ghost rider  Exactly  You're not supposed to understand  He's a bad dream  Do you understand your bad dreams?  You know  Yeah 
[01:25:00]  Do you ride?  I do ride  And I love riding  Motorcycles to me  Are the most  Symbiotic relationship  You can have with a machine  When you get on a bike  You are one with it  And the Yamaha  Who I do not have a contract with  I am not a sponsor  I think is the best motorcycle in the world  Wow  Because I can go 140 miles  An hour  And do it safely  And tell it to stop  And it will stop safely  Oh man  140 miles an hour  Yeah 
[01:25:30]  I'm more a car guy  Like I like fast cars  Sure  Because I think there's this  False perception  That you're a little safer  With that metal around you  Than you are on a bike  But I don't think that's  That's entirely true  But this is just something  About a bike  That scares the crap out of me  Well you are safer  With all that metal around you  Oh okay  Of course  But the Formula One guys know  That the racing motorcyclists  They're it  They're really the superstars of racing 
[01:26:00]  It is ballsy man  When you watch those guys lay it down  And put their knee  On the pavement  I love that  And the guy that I was working with  In Ghost Rider  Rick English  I have to give him some props here  Because he  The man is an acrobat  On a motorcycle  He's doing front endo wheelies  And spinning in circles  And back  It's just mystical  How he does it  I don't know  How do you start to do that  Yeah  I never understood that  Yeah  When you see this crazy trick  You go  Okay how did you start  And how do you do that 
[01:26:30]  For the first time  Right  And even skaters too  How do they  Go up the ramp  And then do a flip  In the air  And land back down  And not break their neck  Yeah  You know it didn't  You know it didn't work out  Well the first time  Yeah  And eventually you gotta go  Okay I'm gonna try this  Officially for the first time now  Yeah  And it's gonna go either way  Right  Yeah  That's balls  It sure is  Yeah  Are you a car guy also  You like  I used to be  I used to be  But I think once you  Once you get into motorcycles  It's very hard to go back to cars 
[01:27:00]  Because nothing really compares  To that feeling  Plus you can  You can beat the traffic  Don't you know  Find it annoying  When you see the guy on the bike  Who's just going right down the highway  And everyone else  I always fear for their lives  That somebody  Is gonna open a car door  Yeah  Is either gonna change lanes  Or try to you know  Move in there  Nothing but respect for those guys  They're never in traffic  They don't have to worry about traffic  I drive in that monster Escalade  And people don't see me  Not seeing motorcycles 
[01:27:30]  Is just  Yeah  Yeah  It's a comfortable car  I just like the size of something  So when I'm driving  You know  Especially in New York City  It's a battle  With the cabs and everything  It's very difficult to drive in this city  I drive a Dodge Ram truck  Oh okay  And what's amazing about that car  Is it's really great for the environment  Because it's a diesel engine  Oh okay  And actually  Some of these hybrid cars  With electric batteries  Are not so good with the environment 
[01:28:00]  Because you have to  The battery eventually  Is gonna die out  And you have to make another one  Which is not great for the environment  Yeah batteries are very toxic  Exactly  And very hard to kind of get rid of  They cost a lot of money  And use energy  When you try to actually recycle them  So a diesel truck  Is actually probably better  In my opinion  Are you much of an environmentalist  And stuff  Do you  I care  Yeah  I do care  I don't want to see  The you know  The tigers go extinct  Well no  The rhino  The black rhino  Is now extinct  I mean it's crazy  I don't like that either 
[01:28:30]  But is it really  Like car exhaust  That's doing that  Or is it people  Just chopping down there  Or is that  And there's also car exhaust  Yeah deforestation  And stuff like that  I mean all of it  You know  Yeah yeah  I like that stuff  But I'm also from the school of thought  That we're kind of on this planet  And you know  Just like everything else  We have a cause and effect  And you know  For our creature comforts  It's going to cost something  Well that's true  But you can do it  In a way that's prudent  Yeah  You know  Just be a little bit 
[01:29:00]  Somewhere in between  Would be nice  Consider it  Well I understand  Believe me  The black rhino  Was beautiful  Yeah  Why don't you want that around  It's gone  It's gone now  Scientists will bring it back  When your kid says  Daddy I love the black rhino  I love rhinoceros  I'd like to go see one  You say it doesn't exist anymore  But it did  Just three years ago  Oh man yeah  We lost it three years ago  No we lost it  I think this year  It was  We couldn't say  The remaining few  It was declared  Officially extinct this year  Wow  You think scientists  Will be able to bring  That stuff back eventually  Probably 
[01:29:30]  But I don't  That's another  Slippery slope  You know  Cloning and all that  I don't know  What that would lead to  In terms of diseases  And things  They have like  They're now breeding  Fish tomato hybrids  Because there's something  In the fish  That preserves the tomato  So they're mixing the two  What can that cause  Oh that doesn't sound good  At all  Doesn't sound tasty  And there are people  That believe  That they're  And I don't know this  I mean I don't want to sound  Like a conspiracy theorist  But there are people 
[01:30:00]  That do believe  They're actually  Clone humans  In full  Living  I would assume  I would believe  I would assume  Scientists all over the world  That have been working on this  Somebody's gonna  You know  Not be as ethical  As the rest  What are their rights  That's where  What could Shakespeare do  With that  The clone  Right  And the donor  What do they  Yeah  Does he have any say  Over his clone  Does the clone  Have any say  Over his life  Yeah  His life  And how do you 
[01:30:30]  And how do you  Turn it into an opera  Yeah  Exactly  That's next  Nick just sitting there  Crying over some poor clone  Yeah  A clone  It could happen  You never know man  I have rights  I'm not just a clone  That would be  Very odd  To think that  You could clone  Your own being  Perhaps  Without a mind  Yeah  And just harvest  Various organs  That you need  Yeah  Well I think all this  Cloning  Talk is because 
[01:31:00]  Just the other night  On SNL  Samberg said  I was his clone  So that whole thing  Started and  Got me thinking again  About climbing  I didn't see your  Appearance  It was a surprise  On SNL  Yeah  They like to keep it  A surprise  But  Yeah  They come out  And everybody goes  Woo  I love that  Yo  I want to see  Ghost Rider  I can't wait  It's fun  In theaters Friday  Nick  That's right  It's in theaters  Spirit of Vengeance  Yeah  Spirit of Vengeance  And who's in this  With you by the way  The magnificent 
[01:31:30]  Idris Elba  Yes  Who's got this  Wonderful larger  Than life presence  Yeah  Johnny Whitworth  This guy is full  Of surprises  There's nobody else  Quite like him  Karen Hines  Plays Satan  Who you might have  Seen in the Rome  Series  And a number of  Wonderful British  Productions  Great actor  Violante Placido  Is the lady  In the movie  Effortless  Charming actress  I mean  Great cast  And what's the  Gist of this  I'm working with 
[01:32:00]  The church this time  Believe it or not  I have to go  And find  The devil's son  And bring him  To a monastery  In Turkey  And have him  Exercised  And that idea  Actually came to me  Because when I was  Promoting the first movie  I was in England  And I was dressed  As a ghost writer  I used to like to  Wear the leather jacket  The leather pants  And the biker boots  And on my lunch break  On a lark  I went to Westminster Abbey  Not knowing that I was  Walking into an  Environmental summit  Between the Archbishop  Of Canterbury  And the Pope 
[01:32:30]  Of the Greek Orthodox Church  And there I was  Sitting in the back  And then a bishop  From Colorado  Looked at me  And went  Oh I didn't know  It was you  If I had known  It was you  I would have  Invited you  To sit with me  Let me introduce you  So there I was  Shaking hands  With the Archbishop  Of Canterbury  And the Pope  Of the Greek Orthodox Church  Dressed like ghost writer  And then the bishop  From Colorado  Leans over  And he whispers  In my ear  Oh and by the way  I can be naughty too  Whoa  What does that mean  Yikes  And I was like  Okay what do I do 
[01:33:00]  With that  I've got it  Let's have ghost writer  Working with the church  Wow inspired like that  In a second  Just like that  And that's how  Spirit of Vengeance  Happened  You got some experiences  I've had some experiences  I like that  I'm lucky  Yeah right  Yeah  That's  Have you always been adventurous  I try to be  I mean I see life  As a gift  And that to just sit there  On the couch  And watch TV  Is probably the biggest sin  And that you  Unless you're watching  Your movies  Yeah well that I don't do  But you need to 
[01:33:30]  You need to take this time  This gift of time  That we have  And do something  With it  And experience it  Stop playing around  Doing nothing  I like doing stuff  I just  I could do it tomorrow  Well  No I'm kidding of course  Tomorrow comes very quickly  I know  And many tomorrows  Stack up very quickly  It's starting to go by  Way too fast  You said something there  You don't watch your own movies  No  Even just once  No I'll watch it once  And then move on  And then that's it  Yeah  And if there is a time  Where you're kind of  Sitting down 
[01:34:00]  And the TV's on  And you see something  Shut it off  Wow  Do you realize your movies  Are very  You can watch them many times  Well that's nice  They're very watchable  Well thank you  What's the reasoning  Behind not watching  The reasoning is that  I want to move on  I don't want to dwell  On the past  It's kind of like  What we were just  Talking about  What's next  And also I don't want  My family to see me  I don't want my  Six year old to see me  And be confused by that  Oh really  I want to try to keep it  As normal as I can  That's interesting  With being somebody like me  Yeah  I'd be bragging 
[01:34:30]  All over the place  Hey I just realized  Thanks to our listeners  That's Stringer Bell  In this movie  From The Wire  Yeah  Oh yeah  Holy shit  Idris Elba right  Idris Elba yeah  Yeah I didn't know  His real name  Lambert makes an appearance  Christopher Lambert  Remember  From  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Christopher  Highlander  Right  Highlander  Yeah  The movie  Wicker Man  Yeah  I liked that movie 
[01:35:00]  And then  The end  Was like  Holy Jesus  Yeah  It was  Did you have any  Any reservations  About an ending  Of a movie like that  Like  No  I think  Neil Lebut  Is famously known  For having a kind of  Twisted ironic  Sense of humor  Wow  And  Yeah  I don't know if you saw  His movie  In the company  Of men  And I knew  Working with him  That we could go  To some places  That would  Really kind of  Push it a little bit  Now when you go  Running around 
[01:35:30]  In a bear suit  Knocking out  A village of women  Who are blowing  Like Viking horns  You know  It's somewhat absurd  Right  And so  The flavor  Of that movie  Was a mix  Of being ridiculous  And also  Scary  The worst  Thing about it  Was the fact  That right up  Until the end  There was this  Weird hope  That you were gonna  Somehow get out  Of that bad situation  And not be horribly 
[01:36:00]  Burned to death  Yeah  And then when it  Happens  You're just kind of like  No  This is  This is a bummer  Right  It's probably  If you see the original  It's probably  The ultimate bummer  Of any movie  Of all time  Yeah  The way that movie ends  Is profound  The way you feel  And it goes on for weeks  I couldn't shake it  For weeks  Yeah  It's one of those  That like  It just kind of  Leaves you with this  Awful feeling  It's  The original  The original  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:36:30]  No yours too  Is like  Just kind of  What  Oh god  It's a horrible way  To die  Well originally  When I did  The Wicker Man  I wanted to play  The cop  With like  A handlebar  Mustache  And really  One of these  Like macho guys  Who's just  Completely absurd  But the producers  Wouldn't let me do it  I think people  Might have understood  A little more  Like the bloggers  And the YouTube folks  That we were  Kind of in on the joke  If I didn't  Had the handlebar mustache  But they  They said  Look we paid this amount 
[01:37:00]  For you to be in the movie  You will not be wearing  A mustache  It's your mistake  If they don't get it  Oh god  I would love to see  With a handlebar  That would have been  You know  Yeah that might have  Helped me  It's like  Ah the guy  With the handlebar mustache  Come on  It's a  It's a goof  Also  Kick ass  Yeah  I love kick ass  It's such a fun  And edgy movie  Being a father  Did you have any 
[01:37:30]  Reservations about  The girl  The young girl  Using that language  No  No  Because I knew  That movie was  Totally ironic  And that  It was a farce  In many ways  And Chloe  Moretz  Is just  Extraordinary  In that film  Oh she was adorable  And just  Hysterical  Yeah  There's something about  When somebody  That innocent looking  Is saying  And doing  Horrific things  I know  That becomes funny  It becomes  You laugh at it  Well I think 
[01:38:00]  I think  All humor  Comes from surprise  Comes from a level  Of shock  On some  That's why  We have things  Like schadenfreude  Where people laugh  When somebody falls down  Which is  Kind of a perverse  Statement about society  In itself  Sure  But there  There it is  It exists  And I think  When people see things  That just are not  Right  It makes them laugh  I don't like  The way people  Try to  Try to  Hide that  And try to  Make it like  We're  We're better 
[01:38:30]  Than that  Right  I think it's just  A basic human nature  To find humor  In that  I don't think  It means that  We all  Want somebody  To get hurt  Or something  But there's something  Just inherently funny  About somebody else's  Misfortune  Well it's a coping skill  Probably on some level  Like even in  Spirit of Vengeance  John Blaze  Is much more  Sarcastic in this movie  He's much edgier  He's much more cynical  And I always thought  Of him as sort of like  Some of the cops  Or paramedics  That I've met 
[01:39:00]  Who developed  This incredibly  Dark sense of humor  Right  To cope with the horrors  That they've seen  And I mean  They say some things  That you just  Would not believe  That could come out  Of their mouth  Oh yeah  Yeah  But they do it  Because if they don't  They can't really  Handle it  Right  Yeah  That's a  Way to put it  Yeah  That's quite true  What did you have  To go through  As far as  Makeup and special effects  On that  To have your head  Burning  The CGI is minimal 
[01:39:30]  In the movie  They dial all that in  Later  Like clearly  It's a flaming skull  Yeah  But in order to  Believe I was the  Character on some level  And not feel  Completely absurd  I would paint my face  To have like skull makeup  So I'd use black and white paint  I would black out my eyes  So you would see no white  No people with black contact lenses  And I would walk on the set  Looking like that  And I wouldn't say a word  To anybody  So it was just very uncomfortable 
[01:40:00]  For everybody  And that made it  So it was like  I didn't have to act  Because I could see the fear  In their eyes  And then it was like  Oxygen to a forest fire  Where I just believed  That was the spirit of vengeance  That's something I think  People have learned  Over the years  With CGI and stuff  And I know  Peter Jackson used it  With the Gollum character  Yeah  He actually had  I can't remember his name offhand  But the actor  Walking around like that  And I think it does help  When there's something  CGI  To have  Yeah that other fact  Someone you can act with 
[01:40:30]  It also helps the other actors  Yeah  Because it gives them  A chance to react honestly  You know  Yeah  So that's what  That process was like  Looking forward to it  When does that come out?  Friday?  Friday  Yeah this Friday  Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance  I want to ask him about  The Civil War thing  People are saying  You might be a vampire  Right  Right  I read this  And I'm like  What?  Yeah but I mean  It's a long stretch  Of course  But it's basically  Gone viral  I guess  Someone found a picture 
[01:41:00]  Of an old Civil War guy  That looks just like  Nick Cage  Yeah  Nicholas Cage  But I say politely  That I think it's a  Slowed version of me  Oh is it?  I think so  I've only heard about this  I gotta see the picture  Really fast  Come on  Oh my god  It's you twisted though  Yeah it's twisted  Yeah you look  That's fucked up  Yeah  Wow  Yeah  But what's funny about that  Is like people  Don't want to let it  Go  Like I went on Letterman  And said I am not  A vampire  I don't drink blood 
[01:41:30]  But the very fact  That I said I'm not  A vampire  Is creating some sort  Of viral thing  Like well clearly  He would say  He's not a vampire  So he could defend  His position as a vampire  Only a vampire  Would say he's not  A vampire  Right  If I didn't know  Any better  I would assume  That was some role  You did  That's kind of creepy  How much you look like  Yeah  Well I mean  It's twisted version  Yes of course  Like his old makeup  Yeah  Yeah he looks like  He's had some type  Of accident  Yeah  I don't  I don't see that  So what is 
[01:42:00]  This guy is from  The Civil War  Is that what they say  Yeah  I think that's what  They're saying  Yeah  So there's a chance  That I have a relative  From the south  The deep south  Imagine maybe  Maybe you're just  Related to that guy  Maybe that's just  One of your ancestors  Clearly he could have  Been one of my ancestors  Yeah  Oh man  That's pretty funny  They will not let it go  I don't know how you go  From that to vampire  But okay  Yeah  Yeah  I like to know  Who was just browsing  Pictures of Civil War  People and went  Holy shit  It's Nick Cage  What's funny about  That picture  Is the guy was trying  To sell it for 
[01:42:30]  Actually a million dollars  On eBay  Come on  And I don't know  What he did with it  But now it's getting  All this attention  Maybe he'll actually  Get it  Maybe he'll hit his mark  I don't know  Sam I'll retweet  You know he wants  You sign him that thing  Well  That's pretty  What the hell  That's a good story  You've got a good story  Yeah it gives me  Something to talk about  He's like  He's at it  He's talking about  Spirit of Vengeance  For God's sake  Are you trying to say  You have enough  To talk about  You don't need to be  Discussing  Whether or not 
[01:43:00]  You're a vampire  Maybe  Yeah  It was  It was on  It was in an email  I got last night  And I'm like  What  Yeah  Really  Does this even  Have to be addressed  It's everywhere  What is it now  We're living in like  Vampire culture  Right  Yeah  Twilight  People are really  Hot about vampires  Yeah vampires  Seem to be  The thing  Vampires and zombies  But they're like  Sexy vampires  Or something  I don't know  Although Dracula  Was kind of a sexy  Kind of a  You know  Guy  But I'm not 
[01:43:30]  The true story  About Dracula  And or actually  Bram Stoker's  Reason for Dracula  Would actually  Make a great movie  Because it actually  Emanated from Rhode Island  Really  Not far from here  Back during  I don't know how many  It was like over  A hundred years ago  When there was like  A very puritanical culture  Like around the time  Of the Salem witch trials  And this guy  Actually had to  Was told that  His deceased daughter  Was haunting  The family 
[01:44:00]  And he was told  By like a priest  That you have to  Go into the tomb  And open it  And put a stake  Through the heart  And that will stop it  And that story went  Viral in those days  By whatever means  And it actually  Got to Bram Stoker  And then he connected  That to Dracula  Or Vlad Tepes  In Romania  And put the two together  But it actually  Is an American invention  Wow  I did not know that  That would be a good movie  Yeah  Boy  The church comes up 
[01:44:30]  With some weird things  To do every so often  Don't they  They sure do  Yeah  Put a stake in them  And everything will be cool  Yeah  That'll work  Well  Yeah  I guess you're  You're a busy guy today  Huh  Yeah  Yeah  I have a couple things  To do today  But then tomorrow  I have off  And then I'll have  Valentine's Day  And so that's all  Any plans for that  Yeah  I'm going to spend some time  With my wife  And a couple of friends  Of ours  That's always nice  Yeah  Where do you live these days 
[01:45:00]  Is it  We used to west coast  I was living actually  In the middle of the  Bermuda Triangle  Believe it or not  In the Bahamas  Oh man  And I'm thinking  I'm going to head out west again  Really  I'm going to go out to Nevada  I think for a little bit  Oh not all the way out west  Did you have a place  In San Francisco  I used to  Yeah  All right  Then my old roommate  Was a lion  He lived a block  From you  And he was obsessed  With pointing out  That's where  Nicolas Cage lives  Oh it was on  Franklin Street  Man I love that house  It was a strange house 
[01:45:30]  Because it was  Werner Erhardt's house  Who invented Est  And he had all these  Strange things  Where you could see  You could see people  Come into the room  With mirror systems  And they would think  That he just had  Telepathy  Oh right  It was just bizarre  Oh wow  San Francisco  Is a great city  Oh gorgeous  Unbelievable  Yeah  Prettiest city  Probably in the country  But I just love  New York City  You know  Yeah yeah  If I could  I would live here  Full time  And the Bahamas  Well the Bahamas  Are gorgeous 
[01:46:00]  They just are  But you know  It's nice to be able  To say hey  Let's go to the museum  And look at the dinosaur  Let's go look at some art  You can do all that  Enough with this beach crap  You gotta fly out  To do anything really  To work  Or anything else  Yeah  But Nevada will be interesting  Because you know  I come from the southwest  And I won't have to hear people say  How do you like our town  Or where are you from  Or do you like New York  Yeah  I love it  Good  And so 
[01:46:30]  You know like in New Orleans  But if I go to Nevada  Then clearly I'll be like home  Yeah  We gotta get him out of here  Yeah he's a busy man  Nicholas Cage  We really enjoy this  I just wanna say that  Yeah yeah  Thank you  Absolutely  We'll say it after you leave too  Just talking about  Just anything  I like that  I like the process  You guys have a cool process here  Instead of just you know  Like sticking to a  Hey let's talk about this  We get some duds in here  And we  Not that we struggle  But it's like  Come on  Let's just have a conversation

[01:50:30]  Debacle  I like that  That's how you do it  Yeah  The publicists have to understand that  Like you have a conversation with a guy  You keep going back to the project  They want to promote  And then it makes that project  A little more interesting for everybody  Yeah  You're wrapping around with some other shit  You're talking to the guy  You know  You're just tacking to the guy  How do you not ask  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar basketball questions  You dumb publicist  I will not let that one go  We shouldn't have done that  Because the publicists did not like it 
[01:51:00]  Yeah  Yes  What do you think of the Civil War picture  That looks  I didn't want to say the word retarded  Just in case  You know  He's offended by that  Something's going on  Or something  But it looks like the retarded Nick Cage  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  That Civil War guy  Is like his face is all  I don't know  I got the picture  I'll tweet in a little bit  But  Great interview  And then he left  And there's a whole bunch of things  We want to ask him  Yeah  We want to ask him about Elvis  What was the other thing  That just came up  Oh man  Yeah  Something else came up too  Ah whatever  I don't know 
[01:51:30]  There was plenty of things to  We'll never see him again  Oh no  We might  Shit  Now it's bothering me  What was it  To promote something else  In the future  Yeah  I liked how down to earth he was  And people were like  Dude  You guys just talked to an Oscar winner  Oscar  For leaving Las Vegas right  He won an Oscar  Oh that was it  Leaving Las Vegas  We didn't get to talk about  Leaving Las Vegas  Yeah  That was a good movie  God damn it  And that opera thing  Was hilarious  Just him  Dude  How do you sit for six hours  In an opera  I don't know 
[01:52:00]  I could barely sit through  Those J.G. Wentworth commercials  Yeah  Holy fuck  I don't even know what that means  I just didn't know  I love it  Oh you've seen him  Yeah  If you have an annuity  And you need  Call J.G. Wentworth  877-CASH-NOW  I have  I want payments  And I need  Cash  No  I went to an opera  With my now wife  And my mother  Really?  About five or six years ago  At Lincoln Center 
[01:52:30]  Yeah  I think it was an opera  And I  Couldn't tell you the name of the thing  Six years later  And I don't even know what happened  I don't know what went on  They didn't have the subtitles in the seats?  Nope  You had to figure out that shit for yourself  I went with the subtitles in the seats  Nothing worse than a singing story  I don't mind a couple songs  But how about we do some talking  To get through some of the tough parts of the story  How about a singing story  Where the singing is in a whole other language?  Yeah  That gets even worse  Now I want to remember this thing 
[01:53:00]  Whatever  Something about the light  Light  Light bearing  Bearer  Light bearer  Light  Light  I don't know  The end of the tunnel  Light  Bright  I don't know  I don't know  It's going to kill you  It is going to kill me  Let's talk about some other stuff  Grammys  We should get back to the Grammys, right?  Yes  We just kind of discussed a few things  Where were we?  Earlier  Oh, we did the Bruce Springsteen? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, Bruce being selfish  And not playing Born to Run or something  That everybody knows  Played a new song  Right  I guess it was good  I don't know  I don't know anymore  I don't know what's a good song anymore  I don't either  I just don't  I know when a pop song is good  Yeah  You know what  What was I going to say?  It was cool seeing little Steven up there, though  It was like, hey, we just talked to that guy  Isn't that weird when you see those guys  Like, wait, he was just sitting here?  He was just here, we were all laughing  So we're connected, kind of  To the Grammys, I guess  One degree of separation to Bruce 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, he left our studio  Went to the Grammys  And we sit here again  Great  Oh, I know what I was going to say  The pop song thing  Yeah  You know a pop song is really good  When you feel like the song's been around forever  Does that make sense?  Oh, oh, like even the first time you hear it?  Yeah, and you go  Oh, yeah, that song's been out  Oh, that song's like 10 years old  Oh, right  I'm trying to  There was an example last night  Somebody sang something  And I was like  Oh, my God  That sounds like a song  That's just been around forever  Yeah 
[01:54:30]  There was one song that they were singing  Somebody was  When the gears were in the background  There were like gears spinning in the set  Bruno Mars  No, not Bruno Mars  Sam likes Bruno Mars  But it sounded like a Duran Duran song  Duran Duran?  Yeah  Who was singing it?  I don't know, but it was  It might have been  Here comes Travis  It was a duet  It was a duet  Because I just came up with an example  But I don't have the song  So my example stinks  No, it doesn't  It was a duet 
[01:55:00]  What was the song last night  Where you go  It's a pop song  And it felt like  Oh, yeah, this has been around forever  Oh, I don't know  I was going to answer  Anthony's question  Yes, thank you  Damn it  Kelly Clarkson  Yes  And some guy  Who's my cutoff at the end  Kelly Clarkson and some guy  Who's the guy?  And they did a live performance  It's a country singer  Jason something  Jason Aldean  Jason who gives a fuck  But it sounded  Part of it sounded like  Duran Duran, Ordinary World  Really? 
[01:55:30]  Yes  I like the Ordinary World  I was like  I know  I'm a fan of the Ordinary World  I like Duran Duran  Call me a faggot  I don't care  Wow, this is a good version  That's all they could do  Yeah, the Grammys keeps pulling everything off  They keep pulling it  Why?  Why wouldn't you want everyone to go  Oh, wow  Let's watch some Grammy stuff  They probably want it on their site  But they haven't put anything on their site yet  Why wouldn't they?  Why wouldn't they have their site  Ready to go Monday morning?  You'd think that it would be up with an hour  In this day and age  I still don't understand some of these people  If you don't want your stuff all over YouTube  Then you get a website together 
[01:56:00]  And put it all up there  So people can check it out Monday morning  What doesn't make sense is that they have  They're not going to rebroadcast this thing  They have acceptance speeches up on their website  But they don't have performances  I don't know if it's like  Maybe they don't have the rights to the songs or something like that  That would make more sense, I guess  The chorus sounds like an ordinary one  No, wait  You missed the part  Oh, there's just a little while 
[01:56:30]  Ah, you keep missing the part  He's not good at this  No  Terrible at it  Oh, maybe  Maybe it was after that  Maybe it was after the big build-up  Yeah, a little while  I had never heard it before last night  You know what?  This might have been the song I was thinking about with my example  Where I feel like this song's been around forever  I felt like that with the Taylor Swift song 
[01:57:00]  But I had never heard it before last night  Oh  And I really liked it  Deja vu  Yeah  I tweeted last night about Taylor Swift  What'd you tweet?  Enough with the gosh golly G act  You're a big fucking star  Enough already  You're a big star  She has a lot of false modesty  Where she makes believe  Oh gosh, I don't even know why I'm here  She's cute  Golly  She is cute though, man  Of course she's cute  Fucking A  She's a tall drink of water too, man  Like to fucking shove my face in a  All right 
[01:57:30]  You know what?  What happened?  That's a little more than cute now  I know  Went from cute to  Look at her  She's just  The watery  Isn't she adorable?  Yeah, she is  I noticed that last night  The second they were done with the song  She was all  I can't believe we did it  Oh my god, I can't believe  Oh my god  Oh god, really?  It's an act  That's what I'm saying  That's why I said a gosh golly G act  Yeah  Put the banjo down too  No one's buying it as much anymore  Enough already  Fucking banjo  I don't have a problem with the banjo  That's stupid  Gimmicky  Look at her though  Wow  She's not gimmicky  She's a country singer  She is a cutie  She went country now, I guess 
[01:58:00]  She's always been country  Oh  She's a little bit country  No, didn't she do crossover pop shit?  Well, kind of like  What?  There was some crossover  But she came out as a country artist  No, no, she's a pop artist  Alright  That's how I know her  She's kind of in that  Like Shania Twain category  Pup star  She's a pup star  And does every song have to be  About a guy that did her wrong?  Really?  That's country  Who would do Taylor Swift wrong?  I don't know  A lot of mean guys out there  Not me though  Jake Gyllenhaal  Yes  John Mayer  Oh, John Mayer 
[01:58:30]  Yeah  John Mayer got in that  Yeah, people like that  He shot a tray up in that piece  I don't know  You think he licked her poop chute?  Oh, God  Who wouldn't?  Wow  That's how you say hello to a girl like that, right?  That's a fine hat you do  You start with that  You remove your hat like a gentleman  And then lick her asshole  Right  Like dogs  Right  Meeting on the street  Good  Did Taylor Swift really call Alzheimer's 
[01:59:00]  Alzheimer's?  Old timers  Alzheimer's  Oh, boy  I have a great theory of Alzheimer's  But you guys didn't want to hear it today, man  I think that's a good way to go out of this world  And how's that?  Because you slowly fade away  What's wrong with that?  Like, let's say you get the big C  Which would obviously suck  So I'm not trying to make fun  But you got the big C  But your brain is completely there  So you watch your whole life  Like, deteriorating in front of your  Your crystal clear brain 
[01:59:30]  Having Alzheimer's  Is like getting the news  That you have cancer every single day  Oh, God  I don't think so  You just remember that you got Alzheimer's again  You just wake up and go like  Ah, well, things are going really well  Fuck, ah, I got Alzheimer's  But then you forget right away  I'm telling you  And then you go, ah, good  Ah, well, life is pretty good  Ah, I got Alzheimer's  You're just constantly getting adrenaline pumped  Is it Alzheimer's, by the way?  Al  Al  No  Hear me out  Listen  I think it's horrible for the family members 
[02:00:00]  But you walking through your life  Slowly fading away  How bad could that be?  No, because you have instances of realizing it  It's not like you don't remember anything ever  Like, it quickly flashes back to you  And you go, oh, shit  All right, but that's like stubbing your toe  You get over it  No, not only that  But then when you're not remembering  You don't know who any of these people are around you  You're constantly scared  I don't know who's in your family  But is that a bad thing?  Oh, all right  Is that a bad thing?  I'll give you that one  Is that a bad thing? 
[02:00:30]  Like Glenn Campbell's going on tour with us  Al  Alzheimer's  Al  Clint Campbell going on tour with Alzheimer's  Hi, I'm  Like a rhinestone  Something  Like a rhino cow  Poof  Just start yelling at the audience to get out of his house  Get out of my house  Who wouldn't buy a ticket to watch that, though?  Riding out on a mule in a star-spangled toaster oven 
[02:01:00]  Like a  Eh  I don't know  You need a teleprompter, perhaps  Look, man  You get mid-70s  And the Alzheimer's starts kicking out  I don't think that's the worst thing in the world  To slowly fade out of this world  But it's not  Because I think the realization that you're going to die  Has to be just horrific  Maybe not at that age  The worst part of the realization would be when it first hits you  And then you can deal with it  When you have Alzheimer's 
[02:01:30]  You can't deal with it  How do you know?  It's first hitting you every single day  That's the worst part  Slow fade  Every day  It's not a slow fade at all  I go slow fade  Slow fade would be cancer  No, because your brain is completely there  So you're like, holy fuck, this sucks  But your body's fading out  You're constantly thinking, holy fuck, this sucks  With Alzheimer's, you're not so much  But with Alzheimer's, you're being tricked  Because every now and then you're thinking  Everything's fine  Oh shit, I forgot  I have Alzheimer's  Yeah, but just walking to get the mail is an adventure 
[02:02:00]  How great is that?  You get run over by cars  You know how mundane most old people's lives get?  Like a kidney stone lampshade  What?  What?  What?  Glenn  Glenn  Read the teleprompter, Glenn  Do you think that's how they're going to do that?  Oh shit  Yeah  Look, you know, I know a lot of you have older relatives with the Alzheimer's  Now  And I know that's got to be a horrible thing  But  He plays guitar, right?  Just a thought  Who?  Campbell?  He don't know  Yeah 
[02:02:30]  I don't know  That's what I'm saying  Like, what if he's in mid-performance  And he just forgets how to play the guitar  Forgets how to play  Just an acapella  Yeah  Oh man  Where's the singer?  He's playing tambourine  In the Wichita line, man  Oh, Nicolas Cage is back on the show  Nicolas Cage, it was a great time here on the show  Why are you calling us? 
[02:03:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Nicolas  Way to go with the bit  Are you talking to me?  Yeah, because everyone in the world is saying  Holy shit, Nicolas Cage sounds like Dr. Steve  Yes, I am  Thanks for blowing my bit  Sorry  A lot of people said  God damn, Nicolas Cage sounds like Dr. Steve  Really?  Yeah, they did  I didn't pick that up  Oh shit  All right  Oh, Flo  Flo  I didn't hear him say Flo  This is going great  Hold on a minute  All right  So Alzheimer's, right? 
[02:03:30]  Listen to me  Wouldn't it be better  You're a hospice doctor, right?  Yes  Wouldn't it be better  You got to get to a certain age, first of all  So let's say  The evil years for a guy are 74, 75, 76  Do your own research  You'll see most guys die in those three years  If you make it past 76, you're going to live well into your 80s  I'm telling you right now  Wow  I've done the research  No one dies at 78  Ask Dr. Steve  No, they don't  Wow  They don't  Dr. Steve  Yeah 
[02:04:00]  I'm telling you  74 especially is an evil fucking age  Wow  75, 76  And then after that  It's like  It's a piece of cake  You're going to be in your 80s  Great  Your life expectancy actually increases  If you live to a certain age  Without having heart disease, diabetes and stuff  So you're absolutely right  So my  There you go  There you go  A doctor backing up my theory  The Alzheimer's, right?  Let's say you make it to 76  Okay  Wouldn't it be 
[02:04:30]  How bad it could be to let your life slowly fade away?  Well, yeah  It's probably not so bad for the person it happens to  Because what happens is they eternally live in the present  Right  And that's, you know  If you talk to people who meditate and stuff  That's the position they're trying to attain constantly  Is being in the present and not living in the future of the past  And when you have Alzheimer's, that's what's going on 
[02:05:00]  Is you have no past and you have no future  You're just living eternally in the present  But it can be miserable for them  Some of those people cry all the time  Some of them laugh all the time  Some of them are just curled up in a ball going la, la, la, la, la  I'd nap  Where it's horrible is for the people around them  Because it completely destroys the person that that person was  And no longer exists  And for the family, it's totally devastating 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, I said it's got to be horrible for the family  That I completely acknowledge  But I'm just thinking you as the individual  You know, when you realize that your time on this earth is coming to an end  I don't know if, you know, fading slowly away is the worst thing in the world  Yeah, right  Now, that's right  The worst part of Alzheimer's is when you know that you've got it  And you feel your life slowly fading away  Because you are aware of it in the beginning 
[02:06:00]  You know, you become forgetful  You start getting lost in your backyard  And that causes a lot of fear and stuff  And so, you know, the best way to go is to do what my dad did  Just go to sleep and wake up  Turn off the clock  Go back to sleep  And then don't wake up again  You know  Yeah  But I mean, when you realize you got cancer or something  You'd go  You had the same thought process  When you realize, holy shit  This is going to kill you  That's right  That's right  Your father hit the snooze on death? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah  Is that what you're saying?  Wait, wow  Yeah, he totally did  He got up, he hit the snooze alarm  And then never woke up again  Wow  That is  Wow  God, and what happens?  Do you just sit there going  Man, this is a long time  That alarm should be going off  This is really something  I'm not complaining  I'm able to sleep longer  But  You try to open up that one eye to see what time it is  Like, wait, why isn't my eye opening anymore?  Man, this is like an eternity  Or something  Right  Wow  How do you know he hit the snooze alarm? 
[02:07:00]  Well, because his wife told me  You know  She heard him  She heard the alarm go off  She heard him turn it off  And then, you know  She woke up about an hour later  And he was gone  Wow  Wow  Yeah, he shot his age in golf the day before  So that's the way to go, you know  How old was he?  86  Ah  So  It wasn't a stellar round of golf  But still  I mean, I guess that's a thing  If you shoot your age  Wasn't a stellar round 
[02:07:30]  An 86-year-old shooting 86  Is a stellar round of golf  Obviously, someone  Doesn't have time to hit the links  I don't know  I would love to do 86 right now  Today  Really?  Yeah  Okay  Anything under 100 for me is good  Believe me  Exactly  I stink on ice  All right, Doc  Steve  Did you like the Grammys?  You know, I watched The Walking Dead instead  Oh, you people  I DVR'd The Walking Dead 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, you could always go to The Walking Dead  I did a Grammy live from the Compound show  Which should be up on iTunes later on today  And weren't we all watching The Walking Dead  When the Beach Boys hit that stage anyway?  Fucking Brian Wilson was just staring off into space  Mike Love didn't even remember the song he wrote  He had to be nudged when it was his part again  Creepy  It was a downer  Yeah, that was not good  So  They looked, yeah, old 
[02:08:30]  Oh, God  He's like a pelican neck  The Beach Men  The Beach Men  You're being kind  The Beach Old Men  Yeah, Pelican is on the keyboards now  Their good vibrations is now Parkinson's  See, because they're shaking  Yeah  And a lot of  Like, Mike Love's not even singing there  He's got a cool hat 
[02:09:00]  He's got a cool hat  I don't know where the band's  Gare of the band you're in  Huh?  That's why they want to sell merch  Gare of the band he's in  Look at everyone trying to get into it  There's stupid Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga with her face wrapped up  They were just hands shaking  They were competing with the Beatles 
[02:09:30]  And now this is at the same stage  That Paul McCartney was just describing  Just like killing it on stage  Yeah, McCartney showed everyone how it's done  They had so many other people involved with this  To try to make it sound good  Everybody, everybody, see you all  Now everybody comes out  Oh, that's great 
[02:10:00]  I love when they bring other people out  And it's a big jam  And it just sounds like shite  That's the dude from The Voice  Hey  Maroon 5  What?  Maroon 5  Maroon 5 guy  Alright  Woo!  Yeah, Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney  Are both going to be 70 this year  Wow  Whoa, that's a big difference in 70s  Yeah, there's a big difference  Wow  Right there  McCartney's going to be 70 this year?  Yeah  Wow 
[02:10:30]  Alright, Dr. Steve  Will you still need me?  Will you still feed me?  When I'm 70  Yeah  That means Lennon would have been  Vladimir?  Lennon was like 4 years older, I think  The music one  Dotted in 1980  At 40 years old  Was that it?  1980?  Uh, yeah  I think so  He would have been, what, 72 this year, maybe?  72, 73, maybe?  See, but you remember him as the hip  He would have been 72  Guy walking around New York still 
[02:11:00]  Yeah  Fucking rebel  Long hair and everything  Yeah  And, uh, you look at Paul McCartney like  Eh, he's got another youngster next to him  That's just gonna  Make more millions  You know, every day  People file past the Dakota  Because it's in my neighborhood  Getting their death photo  Fanning?  They get their death photo  See, I mistook the building  Oh, yeah  Very good  Just keep doing that  All day long  They get their death photo  Modeling, what's that like?  Fun? 
[02:11:30]  I saw that the other day  I just had to say it  I tell that to Melissa all the time now  Modeling, what's that like?  Fun?  Fucking Costanza  Steve, anything else?  No, I got nothing  Obviously  Dr. Stane  All right, Arthur  All right, Weird Medicine, of course  Look for it  Yeah, Saturday's at 9pm  Yeah  Opium Anthony channel  It's very entertaining  It really is  It really is 
[02:12:00]  Uncensored doctor talking about  Usually people want to talk about their assholes  Their balls, their dick  And women's vaginas and women's tits  Yep  Yeah  As opposed to guys  You got a good fact about tits  Before you leave?  Give us a good tit fact, Dr. Steve  Well, apparently there's an artery in the tit  That can explode sometimes  Oh, stop  What?  What, it happened one time?  Yeah, it happened to my wife 
[02:12:30]  Oh, sorry  Jesus  We were playing  She had had a breast reduction  But I also call that a mutilation  Yes  Wait, she had too much tit meat?  Yeah, she went from a double G to a double D  So she's okay  Double G  Double G  Wow, man  After the D  It just gets into those freak sizes, man  That doesn't seem fair, though  You married her as a double G, right?  Well, now she was double D and then sort of grew to the double G 
[02:13:00]  And it's a genetic thing  Her mom's boobs, I mean, seriously hang down to her knees  And she saw that happening to her  So she had to do something about it  So, obviously you weren't breastfed as a child  Right  You're attracted to the big ones  The bigums  Yes  Absolutely  So there's this big artery in there that can explode  Now, what would cause it to burst?  Well, the way we figure it must have happened 
[02:13:30]  Is after the reduction  There was a little scar tissue that was starting to shrink around this artery  And it was like a dance, dance revolution on New Year's Eve  Something happened in there  And that scar tissue sheared off  The artery  And it started pumping blood into her right breast  Oh, my God  So that boob starts swelling?  Oh, my God 
[02:14:00]  It was twice the size of the other one  It was sticking straight out  It looked like, you know, an Anna Nicole implant  And was it all black?  Was it getting, like, blue and black?  No  Or black and blue?  Because the blood was so deep in the breast tissue  It was just like you just shoved a giant implant in there  Wow, man  It was hard as a rock  Damn  And fortunately her  But your dick?  It was very painful, too 
[02:14:30]  So I couldn't take advantage of it  But she, uh  Her plastic surgeon was on call that day  And I got her to the emergency room at 3.30 in the morning on New Year's Day  Wow  And she evacuated half a unit of blood  Which is basically 500 mLs  Which is, uh, half a liter  Did she have to eat a lot of sugar cookies after that?  To get her blood back up?  No, she had to get some cookies  Can you donate tit blood?  For the people that need, uh, some blood? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah  Yeah, where does that blood go?  Just put it in a bag?  Right  No  No  Could you use it for vampire makeup?  For Halloween?  Yeah  Yeah  Hey, I got a dumb, um, a dumb question-slash-observation  You know when, like, when you were growing up and stuff  And, well, certainly to this day  When you see a bra laying around, it's kind of sexy  And you're like, oh  You know what I mean?  Yeah  And then all of a sudden you'll see one of those giant bras  And it goes from, like, kind of that sexiness  That sexual feeling you get inside 
[02:15:30]  To you just have to openly laugh  Yeah, it's funny  Why is that?  I don't know  It happens at stores, too  When you walk into the foundations department  Right  And you see, like, the bras  And then you see the giant fucking bras  And you just go  Yeah, it goes from being titillating  Yes  To just silly  To funny  At what, what, how, uh, at what size you think that happens  The crossover from  You're kind of titillated by seeing bras hanging or just laying around  And then the big, over-the-top big ones 
[02:16:00]  I think it's the  I think if you can fit your head in it  Maybe that's what makes it funny  The thought that you can fit your head in it  I also think it's the style, too  Yeah  If they try to even keep them the least bit lacy and sexy  Even though they're huge  Right  They're not as funny as the ones that just look like  Something that fastens cargo into a plane  What about, yeah  The bra has to itself collapse a little bit  If you throw it and it's still looking like a domed stadium  Yeah  It looks like those things that they keep sand in 
[02:16:30]  Right  That the county keeps sand in for snowstorms  It's not titillating anymore  No, it's not titillating  You're right  If it just collapses flat on the floor like a piece of lingerie  You're like, oh, I know it was just in there  Yeah, that's fine  That's sexy  But if it literally bounces  And then just comes to a stop  And retains its exact shape  If you can't  Funny  If you can't fold it with the rest of the laundry  Are we doing a bit here?  I think we're doing a bit  We need a sound effect when we go into bit mode 
[02:17:00]  Oh, man  If you can't, like, fold it with the rest of the laundry  Right  It's not titillating anymore  It's not titillating  It's just silly  If it looks like it's a hat for Siamese popes  If not titillating  Oh, we got Dr. Steve on the line  What?  I knew you were an imposter  Hold on a minute  Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve, what's up, sir?  Good morning, boys  I wanted to let you know  I did make a wine out of my wife's tit blood 
[02:17:30]  Oh, no!  Come on!  I'll be offering it for Valentine's Day  It's a limited edition  Well, send us the copy  We'll do reads for it  Absolutely  Make wine out of your wife's tit blood  You know, we haven't talked about Dr. Steve's shitty wine in a while  My sister was up from Florida  Terry, she listens to the show every day  And she goes, you had a wine made after you?  Oh, God, right  Because Dr. Steve's shitty wine is on my desk 
[02:18:00]  Oh  I go, well, not really  It's just a thing  I'm sure you're storing it on its side  Yes  No, I'm never drinking that  Mine's in my wine closet  But the amount of wine it goes through  It's still sitting in there, too  Isn't that amazing?  And there have been nights I've been like  Fuck, I could use some wine tonight  And I still gotta wait for the delivery  And that one bottle is just  It's one bottle in an entire room  With wine racks 
[02:18:30]  And it remains unopened  And I just look at it like  Yep, that fucker's staying right there  Waiting for it to increase in value  How about those bras that, like, they have too much metal in them, too, man  Oh, yeah, yeah, the underwire  The reinforcement and all that shit  Yeah  That doesn't make any sense  I guess some of these women need some support  Right  God, that's gotta hurt these girls  Those big fucking tits  Their back is always fucked up  Mm-hmm  So just lay on your back 
[02:19:00]  And let us juggle them around  What?  Yeah, their chest wall's got the indentation from that underwire  Yeah  We've never quite figured out how that wire  Being completely under the tit does anything  Yeah, how does that hold it up?  If it's where the tit meets the chest  Don't ask  Instead of, like, in mid-tit  It's all about leverage  And I don't see there being much leverage  To hold up the tit  If you're putting what would amount to the pivot point  Right there  Yeah, that's fucked up  The only thing I can think of 
[02:19:30]  Is it just keeps the whole fabric from collapsing  Yeah, it's probably something like a bridge  Like a fucking bridge  Where you see cables and you go  That doesn't seem like it should hold that up  But I guess the engineers know what they're doing  Yeah, they figured it out a long time ago  Yeah  While we were perfecting the dick joke  Well, uh  All right, Steve  Yeah  All right, boy  Oh, wait, we're still playing  If  We're playing if you  With the bra thing  Go ahead, Joe and Hoboken  Yo, buddy  If you can use the bra to wax a bowling ball 
[02:20:00]  It's just not sexy anymore  Ah, see  You can wax a bowling ball with it  There you go  See, he's in on the bit  I gotcha  Mm-hmm  Yep, yep, yep  All right, Doc, Steve  That weird medicine's on sometime on our channel  Saturday  Saturday  9  9  9 a.m. Sunday  You know, 9 p.m. Saturday  Yeah  9 p.m. Saturday  9 a.m. Sunday  Yep  Thank you, boys  Thank you, Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  I like Dr. Steve  We like the Dr. Steve 
[02:20:30]  He's a fun guy  I wish he lived closer  Because he likes to drink  He does, huh?  He could use another drinking buddy  You're, uh, what?  Running out of drinking buddies?  What's happening?  No  Falling by the wayside  No, I could just always use more  You know?  The more people that are drinking with you  The better you feel about your drinking  Mm-hmm  I think  I hear you  We're gonna break  Because we have Valentine's Day shit to get to  Oh, is that  It's not even to do with, like, the show part of it  Let's break because  It's like, let's break  Well, yeah  Because we have Valentine's Day stuff to get to 
[02:21:00]  And people have had it  I'm not even gonna lie to you  They've had it  People sitting in this room have had it  And, uh, I think it ends tomorrow  Well, it's gotta  Oh, man  Well, today's the day, right?  Well, tomorrow's Valentine's Day  So  They're not gonna be able to guarantee delivery  We might have a little mop-up tomorrow  Tomorrow  But after today, for the most part  We go back to normal  Yeah  The normal live read schedule  Because it's killing people  Belated Valentine's Day gifts  And we might have Springsteen tickets  I don't know  Oh, shh  But if we promote it  Then there's gotta be rules  So I don't even know if we have the tickets 
[02:21:30]  To some special, uh, thing  Yeah  Can't even talk about it  Can't talk about it  But if we can't talk about it  Why would we even do it?  Well, the second you bring it up  You gotta give mail away  You can talk about it when you do it  But we don't even know  Do we have them?  I don't know  See, I know we have them  But I gotta make believe we don't  Because then if  Then, uh  If I  If I tell people we definitely have them  Then we have to write rules or something  Yeah  We might not have them  This radio thing has gotten very complicated  I remember the days  You would just fucking  You know  Tease ticket giveaways 
[02:22:00]  Oh, it was great  You'd, uh, wait for your friend to call  And give him the tickets  And  That was fantastic  Ixnay  On the ickits tay  On the free trip to Ireland, eh  Iwe, ave, gay, ake, awe  Um, say, ilire, ud, gay, itchay, utay, ensfray  Octarday, a-gay  Octarday, a-gay  That's impressive  So  Hypothetically  Because now we have to say that now  Mm-hmm  Hypothetically  If we had tickets 
[02:22:30]  Let's say to  Paul McCartney  Uh-huh  Paul McCartney played at the Apollo Theater  I would love those  At Pat  You can't have them  Oh  But we wouldn't be able to tease  That we have Paul McCartney tickets  To  To maybe help  You know  Our show  You could say we might be giving them away later  Oh boy  But if you say  I thought that was taboo  Don't say how  But if you say you definitely have Paul McCartney tickets  And you're going to give them away before 10 o'clock  Then  What happens?  I don't know  We might be able to say that  That's a gray zone  Then there's a whole lawyer thing  And they've got to write rules 
[02:23:00]  I don't think we can say  Hey we have these tickets  That we're going to give away at 9 o'clock  And here's how we're going to do it  What happened?  Rules  What made this complicated?  Rules  What do you think?  I don't think it's the company  Is it like New York State or something?  I don't know  Maybe it's a federal law  There's some law that has been enacted  Maybe it's some tea's giveaways anymore?  It's against fraud or something  Fraud  There's a very fine line between just doing basic giveaways  And when it turns into a contest that there are rules for  Why did this have to turn into something like that 
[02:23:30]  Wall Street has to pay attention to  Like fucking stock exchange rules  SEC is on your ass  This is just goofy giveaways  By the way  Really quickly  I have picked out my new phone  Oh  And every single person I know in my family  Including my wife  Including the gang in Philly  Including my brothers  All have iPhones  So you're getting the iPhone?  No  Why are you getting phones 
[02:24:00]  Time after time that you don't like  You know how it drives you guys nuts?  He's a glutton for punishment  He is  It is driving everyone in my family now nuts  You're a glutton for punishment  Because now they're screaming at me too  I'm like they scream at me at work  I don't need to be screamed at at home too  What are you getting?  The Galaxy 2  Oh my god  The Samsung Galaxy 2  And what  Oh yeah  Is that the big one that looks like it's almost a tablet?  I know  What made you get that?  I haven't got it yet  Well what's making you get that?  You gotta buy new jeans with bigger pockets 
[02:24:30]  It's a little big  I might have to get homey jeans to carry this around  You're gonna need cargo pants from now on  What?  A fanny pouch  What's it got?  Everyone is begging me  Will you just fucking buy an iPhone?  I'm like no  No I like this one  Does it have a kickstand?  It's a little big  But I've been told that the phones are gonna start getting a little bigger now again  Is it one of those slick new phones that comes with a stylus that I keep?  No stylus  Yes it's a stylus  Yeah I don't know why they would like introduce the stylus in the year 2012 again 
[02:25:00]  I don't know why you would get the Galaxy  It's the dumbest Super Bowl commercial ever  That stylus is to pull out and jam in the eye of the person that's trying to sell it to you  Is Travis right?  Is it the one with the kickstand?  I don't have a kickstand  Samsung  What does it have?  What made you choose that one?  It's not an iPhone  That's the sheer reason  And my guy actually said look if I didn't like apps so much I would buy this phone  It's an iPhone  The button is designed to look like the iPhone 
[02:25:30]  Whatever  It looks like one of those Chinese knockoff iPhones  The phones are getting bigger because we're now watching our movies on our phones  Right people?  You could fucking watch it on an iPhone  Nope  Samsung  Galaxy 2  Oh my god  I think that's where I'm going with  Yeah  What happened to the Galaxy 1?  Nobody bought it  It did alright  Nobody bought it  It did alright  I like the droids  It's kind of like a droid phone right?  Yeah it runs the Android operating system  That's great  Yeah Android operating system fucking rules 
[02:26:00]  That's terrible names  And the video is in HD  Android is indeed the second best phone operating system  I'll agree with that  It is  It's definitely up there  More Android phones out there in the market than iPhones  That's because there's a lot of shitty phones  That's your problem  And they put Android on 5 million phones  That's your problem  That's your problem  Android is the operating system  Oh man  What'd you do?  Mine's exclusive now  Yeah someone's got a special phone  How'd you get that?  What is that?  Black in front, white in the back  Oh because you're like half and half 
[02:26:30]  That's not right  That's not right  Oh I get it  They only give those phones to half and halves  To half breeds  To the Oreos  Mulata  It's the Mulata special edition  How'd you get that?  I replaced the black glass  And they were like  Oh we'll put another black thing on  I was like  Why don't you put a white piece on?  Like we can't do that  That's pretty cool  It's fucking not sanctioned  That's not sanctioned  It's exclusive shit now  Apple didn't do that  By the way Travis  To answer your question  That's the Galaxy Note  Oh okay good  Alright  Cause they are like  Also coming out with the 
[02:27:00]  You know  I saw a commercial for some phone  That was just way too big  Like the person could barely hold it in their hands  I think that was the Galaxy Note  I think it was a Super Bowl commercial  If I'm not mistaken  But I'm not going with that shit  Oh man  So when are you getting this new phone?  Huh?  When are you getting it?  Oh look at that  It's bigger  It's oh god  It's bigger  It's less style  What?  Look at the comparison  It's bigger  And yet it doesn't look like the screen as much  Ah it's a little bigger yeah  I wish Jimmy was here  Cause it drives him nuts more than any of you  Oh he goes crazy  It's so stupid 
[02:27:30]  Why?  Look  It's so stupid  It's just a little bigger than the iPhone 4  It's all busy  It's just a little bigger  All the features that you've ever said I want in a phone  Yeah  You're like this phone would be perfect if only it had  You got HD video with the iPhone 4?  Yeah  Yes  So do I with the Galaxy 2  But you know  It's already in the iPhone  You don't  It's there  Galaxy 2  Samsung  It's there  That's what I'm going  You use iMovie  For a mere 700 bucks  700 bucks  Yeah you use iMovie  You use a Mac  Why wouldn't you want your phone to interface with your equipment 
[02:28:00]  Without any problems  Seamlessly  Because it's all the same stuff  Cause I'm not buying into this iPhone culture  I'm sorry  Yeah you're right  It's a fad  I'm sorry  First of all you bought an iPad  And an iBook or whatever they're called  Yeah  Macbook  Macbook Pro  Powerbook Pro Macbook  That's the culture  I give them a little taste  But I'm not going all in  But that's just it  The one piece  Healthy not to go all in  The key piece  Your phone  Yeah  Would interface so easily  With all those other items  You should have not gotten the computer and the iPad 
[02:28:30]  That would have been not gone  Right  Right  Right  You're backwards  Yeah your entire body is in the pool  And you're just like refusing to dunk your head  Yeah  You're looking for an air pocket  Yeah  Why are you guys so frustrated over my phone choice  Cause you do it on purpose  Yeah you specifically choose bad phones  It's so calculated  It's so calculated  Oh my god  See the Galaxy not bad of a phone  I like that  Sure yeah not bad  That's a good review  That's what you want 
[02:29:00]  Not bad  That's a good review right there  Hey it's not bad  The Beach Boys last night were not bad  No they were terrible  Okay you're right  But I mean I have seen movies that  You know what it wasn't bad  I don't mind that  Yeah well you're never going to watch it again  I don't mind that on my phone  How about a StarTac  Not bad  StarTac  Makes a call  Now you're talking  Now you're talking  Now you're talking  Ah  See iPhone sucks balls  I'm proud of Opie  Thank you  Sweet phone Opie  Thank you  Yeah  How could anyone say iPhone sucks balls  iPhone screens are too little  Thank you 
[02:29:30]  If you don't like it  You could say well there are certain things I don't like about it  So I decided not to get it  But sucks balls  Stupid  I don't think the iPhone  You can't call  The phone that is modeled after  Or  Every other phone is now modeled after the iPhone  You can't say it sucks  This was the first fucking phone that was this  And now every other phone is trying to be like it  And it sucks balls  What sucks balls  The innovative touch screen  That everyone else adopted  By the way Sam 
[02:30:00]  What were you saying about my phone choice  Sucked balls  Stupid  Oh really  Yes  Dave on Long Island  Go ahead Dave  Sam you suck balls dude  Why don't you get a better TV than what you bought  Yeah you're out of this tech talk Sam  Your TV sucks balls  Because I'm not in a position where I can buy literally any piece of technology I want  You're out of the tech talk  Sorry  I'm saving money  Turning your mic off  Saving money  Anyone that has a tiny TV can't talk about phones  Exactly  So if you win this all you're hands down 
[02:30:30]  Nice  Now if people are saying  Gold star for me  That the phone sucks balls  Well I mean the phone part of it maybe  What?  The phone part of the iPhone  Maybe  I don't make phone calls  Officially  Nobody does  No but I officially have told my family that I don't make or receive phone calls anymore  I officially told them  Oh good  Good  Yeah  No I'm serious  No but I officially told them  Because they're getting really mad  They're like why isn't your voicemail set up  And why don't you ever answer your phone 
[02:31:00]  So I finally had to send out an email  That I officially do not answer phone calls or make phone calls on my phone anymore  Text me  Text me  I'll text you back  I'll text back  No problem  It's fast  It's easy  I'm not saying we're not going to communicate  This is the way it is now  I could do it on my time  Right  Which is a lot easier  Plus I might have a little hearing loss so I can't hear anymore  What?  Abbott and Costello over here  I get very irritable when I have to like actually use my phone for a phone call 
[02:31:30]  And I think that might be because maybe I can't hear as well  Maybe I can't hear  Maybe this incessant fucking hissing and ringing in my ears from these headphones  You know what happened today?  I didn't even want to say it during the Nicolas Cage interview  I thought I was in the middle of a hearing test  Oh no  Were you raising your hand?  I wanted to raise my left hand  There was something going on over here  Yeah, that's exactly what I was hearing  Yeah  That just started  I get this too  Really? 
[02:32:00]  I don't have that  At night I have to have the TV on  I gotta have the TV on  All of a sudden I'll just have a tone in my left ear  Yeah  Just a tone for a couple seconds  A little loke  Wild thing  Yeah  Fucking Cole Medina  Same song  Wild thing  How the fuck did he get two hits?  Bow  Bow  Bow  Black history  Wild thing  So there you go  There's my phone choice  I think I'm going to purchase it today  Maybe we'll do something after the break 
[02:32:30]  The wild thing  We might have tickets  Maybe  Well, I don't know  We can't say that?  Like what?  That's stupid  Why would we even do this?  Maybe we can  I'll talk to  You know I hate giving my word  Because my word is good  Believe it or not  That's my word  I'm an asshole  But I'll tell you this much about me  If I give you my word  I hold to that usually  And someone actually came to me  And go  Look  We might have something to give away  But you gotta give me a word  That you're not gonna make fun of it  And I actually had to give my word 
[02:33:00]  Fuck  Yeah  There's nothing to make fun of  This is a great prize  Oh it is  Of course it is  Well, there's a part of it  That is so make-fun-able  I'll write it down  Because I gave my word  The person  No, not the person  I gave my word, Ant  So I gotta write it down  I heard the word  You know what I'm talking about?  Ba-ba-ba-ba-bar-bar-bar  Bar-ba-bar-bar-bar  Yeah  I knew that was coming  Of course  Here's  Why  What else did I do?  Here's the part that you can make fun of  Oh, right  And he goes, look  And he even mentioned this part of it  And he goes, but do you have my word? 
[02:33:30]  You won't make fun of that  So I can't make fun of that  Because my word is good  Yeah  Isn't there another word song?  It's in the music folder, Eric  Word  Word up  Ah, yeah  Word up  That's one  Word  But that's just because we have so many  Oh, really?  Yeah  No more words  Oh, yeah  No more words  Berlin?

He really is  By the way  The iPhone is now being called a hunk of dog shit  Oh, now  Come on  Joe Dawson from Beth Page, Long Island  It's not a hunk of dog shit 
[02:34:30]  Were you into Berlin?  You may not like it  I'm still into Berlin  Oh  Oh  Very good  Oh, boy  No, I  You know, in the 80s  Being a child of the 80s  I  Didn't they have the Metro of Love or something?  I'm running on the Metro of Love  Was that them?  I think so  No more words  Ah  Then they had that other song  Nozio  Um  I don't know  Didn't they have another hit?  Take My Breath Away 
[02:35:00]  Ah, right  What is that from Top Gun?  Yep  Take My Breath Away  Didn't they do a band for United?  Listen to that keyboard  That 80s  It was probably a  Fucking  Keytar  The guy's holding his keytar on stage  How silly  Key, key, keytar  Put her on a rack, you dummy  Yeah, that's a yoga song  You want to be a guitarist?  Be a guitarist  Key, key, keytar  Oh, Jesus  She was, like, kind of cute back then, too  Let's take a look at her 
[02:35:30]  Blonde, black hair  I don't know if she was cute  I don't remember  Nah  Let's take a look at the Berlin lady  In this video  I think she was kind of cute  I don't remember  Berlin band  Don't fuck with me  And don't get a picture now  Don't get a picture of the reunion tour picture  You fucking hump  Yeah, stop  No  Put the hair  I mean  Where is she?  That was the time  Well, it was  Yeah, this is the Metro of Love  Alright  Do, do, do, de, do  Oh, the Metro of the Club 
[02:36:00]  Alright  Put Berlin band  Uh, yeah  Yeah  No  How about, um  See, all you're doing is finding good pictures  And you just want to prove that she  Why didn't  No  You know what?  I was a child of the 80s  I didn't have the child of the 80s hairdo  Search your name  Did you hit?  Uh  I didn't have the child of the 80s hairdo  I had a child of the 70s hair  Which is weird  Because you were a child of the 80s 
[02:36:30]  I know  Strange  I spent a teen year in the 80s  Oh, God  Oh, God  That's new now  That's now  Wait, that's all grown up  But if you click the all grown up picture  They go back to the old  That was the old version  Yeah, you  Sam  Oh, Sam  Go back to that TMZ shit  You're punching up pictures of her now  Keep going backwards  Until you get that TMZ member her thing  I'm getting angry with you  Okay, now if you click on her  You get to see what she used to look like  No, that was the picture  Oh, that's her now 
[02:37:00]  Wait, go back then  So this is the one that  She's not good looking  Nah, she's kind of cute  Yeah  A little bit  Yeah, yeah  Glad we got that settled  Sometimes you get so deep into something  You don't realize  There's no reason to do this  We're doing important work here  Yes, we're doing important work here  I'll just  Trying to get by  You want to do some Black History Month shit?  Yeah, this is a good one  And then we might have something to give away  I don't even know  Remember? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  I gave my word  You did give your word  Very good  First this  For Black History Month  The Opie and Anthony Show  Recognizes some of the individuals  Whose contributions have shaped  The African American community  And changed all of us  For the better  Today, we acknowledge  The African American athlete  And entertainer  Kamala  Coming from the jungles of Uganda  Kamala was able to break  Both cultural and language barriers  To become one of America's  Premier professional wrestlers 
[02:38:00]  Thanks to companions like Kim Chi  Kamala was able to make the transition  From headhunter to pro wrestler  Seem effortless  And push the boundaries  By doing it all  In a loincloth  I have not been for you, Kamala  A giant Black man  With a moon painted on his belly  Would have come off as silly  And offensive 
[02:38:30]  Stay tuned  As we continue to recognize  Significant African American contributions  For Black History Month  Here on the Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  Whether or not you're paying attention  Is another question  Let's do it  Ah, this is what I'm talking about  I loved this performance  At the Grammys last night  It was pretty amazing  Wow, wow, wow  I love that one  This was on my soundtrack  For the 80s 
[02:39:00]  When I was a child of the 80s  I had this one  Wow  Oh yeah  I want to thank all the tech heads  Out there  Because I was about to buy  The Galaxy 2  Yeah, we heard  And a lot of people were going  Hell no  Wait for the Galaxy Nexus  Oh  And it's coming in a lot  I love when you have to wait  For something  And then it comes out  And it sucks too  But it's only a month away  And I'm going on vacation soon  And I don't want to like  Bring my brand new phone  To the beach  Why not? 
[02:39:30]  So I'll fuck with the old phone  On the beach  I'll come back  All nice  Nice and tan  And then I go  Hey, give me the Galaxy Nexus  This is perfect for me  But what if you  Go to the beach again  With the new phone?  Well, that'll be in the summertime  And by that time  I don't care  If it gets scratched up  Or a little sand on it  What are you doing  With your phone on the beach?  Throwing it?  Are you playing frisbee  With a dog with it?  You don't have a kid, man  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, kids grab your phones  All the time  That's annoying  This is why you need an iPhone 
[02:40:00]  Because you can give it to the kid  Let me tell you  What my kid does now  For some reason  I decided it was really smart  To have my TV  Really low in my living room  So when I sit on the couch  It's perfect eye level  Not up high  And he's got like  This raking toy  That he likes  And guess what?  He's raking  Probably the TV  Yeah  And has no concept  That might not be a good thing  No  What are kids doing?  Huh?  What are kids doing?  I will never hit my kid  And I will make you  This promise today, sir  Yeah  But I completely understand  Why people hit their kids 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  Fuck yeah  I don't doubt it  They could get a little annoying  But I, for one  Will not be doing that  Which makes it a bit frustrating  Until the TV falls off  I have to go elsewhere  In my apartment  And bite myself really hard  Yell out curse words  And punch things  And get myself together  Because, man  Man  Man, you get the itch  I got the itch  To start swinging  No, that's a complete joke 
[02:41:00]  And I hope you understand that  Man  It's not a joke  But you know what I am  Of course I do  You know what I'm saying, right?  Anyone with a toddler  It almost sucks  It almost sucks  That they've taken that  Out of the playbook  Another kid thing  Really fast  My kid loves  Buzz Lightyear  And Toy Story  All three movies  Oh, what kid doesn't?  Because  I've lost  Every single copy  Of Toy Story  I got the box set  I don't know if you know this  It has three copies  Of every movie 
[02:41:30]  You got the Blu-ray  You got the regular  And you got the digital  It's nice  I have that  It's very good  Oh, you know what I'm talking about?  Of course I do  All right, maybe you can help me out  Or maybe some of these tech people  Could help me with a workaround  So I've lost every copy of the movie  And he still wants to watch Toy Story  And we're renting it every day  And I think I've spent  Close to $1,000 on Toy Story  How did you lose the copies?  One might be in a car  Oh, boy  I have a lot of nephews and nieces  I think they took a copy  Does he like Toy Story 3?  He gets scared out of his mind  He doesn't like Lotso?  He hates 
[02:42:00]  No  Because I was going to say  Toy Story 3 is free on Netflix  Oh, really?  It's streaming on Netflix  Oh, really?  Know what he hates  But he wants to watch  I try to turn it off  Shrek  Scares the living shit out of my kid  Really?  But I go  All right, let's turn it off  And he'll shake his head  Like, no  And then he'll just grab you  And he just gets into it  That's hilarious  Why is  And as a parent  You're like, all right  You don't want your kid scared  So let's turn off the TV  He will not let you turn off the TV  But he's scared  I'm trying to figure out that emotion  That's pretty weird  But anyway  Here's the workaround 
[02:42:30]  So I get the box set  I'm like, I'm down to the digital copy  I'm like, let's put it in one of the laptops  Because we want to watch the Grammys  All in one room  So you put him on the fucking laptop  At the Toy Story  And we watch the Grammys  I need the digital code  Shouldn't it already be in your iTunes?  What?  Shouldn't it be in your  No  You need the papers that they came with?  There was one lousy piece of fucking paper  That came in the box set  Oh, yeah  Like you didn't  You haven't put it in your iTunes  Oh, no  This is going to be the first time  No  But because I've been going through the box and stuff  I think  Knowing how stupid I am at times 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah  I thought it might have been a coupon or something  Yep  And I don't know where that is  So now I can't use the digital copy  No  Correct  Here's the question  Is there a workaround?  Of course there is  You just have to find a new code  From where?  No  But why wouldn't they  Why wouldn't they write the digital  Here's my question  Yeah  If you have the box set  That means you purchased it, right?  I just put my tongue in the middle saying that  Oh, fuck did that hurt  And why wouldn't they give the code on the box itself? 
[02:43:30]  So you're not going to lose it  Because then  It was just a tiny insert  A little flimsy piece of paper that had Toy Story on it  And I wasn't thinking  Yes  If it was on the outside of the box  You could see it in the store  Not even on the outside  How about inside?  You bought it  You're opening up the packaging  Why can't it be somewhere  Where you're not going to lose it so easily?  Yeah  Maybe it's more expensive  To print the box differently every time  I don't know  So frustrated  I'm like  I don't know where that fucking piece of paper is  I haven't seen that piece of paper  Since we got this  Four months ago  Or whatever it was  You're fucked  I am, right?  You're going to have to get a whole new box set 
[02:44:00]  Just to get the digital copy  Yeah  That fucking sucks  But then you'll have all the other copies too  I wasn't thinking though  Watch them a little  Yeah, because we had the Blu-ray and the regular  So I'm like  I'm not even thinking  That I might need a code for the digital copy  You understand what I'm kind of saying?  Yeah, yeah  Definitely  Anyway  My God  What else about the Grammys?  We teased the Grammys all day  And we haven't really talked about it  Well  Yeah, we kind of talked about  The Beach Boys and Paul McCartney  And Bruce 
[02:44:30]  Does anyone know why Joe Walsh was on that stage?  Mmm  Trying to figure it out  There was that big guitar jam at the end  And there's Joe Walsh  Why was he there?  I guess because he's kind of a  You know, age-wise with Paul McCartney  And it's not like just having some young rocker up there  Yeah  But it's not like they said  Hey, here's Paul McCartney  And on guitar, Joe Walsh  I know  Joe Walsh  But the rest of the guys  It made sense  Because Bruce was already there  Doing his thing up front  Then you had Dave Grohl  Who else was up there? 
[02:45:00]  Joe Walsh  And I think it was somebody else too  But everyone else had something to do with the Grammys  So it made sense to bring them all together at the end for the jam  But I don't know why Joe Walsh was there  I don't know  Joe Walsh has a  He's got a nice head of hair, doesn't he?  He sure does that  He's got that big cloth still  Think it's real?  I think it is  He never went through a point where it looked like  He was losing it and then he got more back  You know?  Yeah  Do we like Bruno Mars?  No  That was one of the dumbest 
[02:45:30]  I felt like I was watching Streets of Fire  Yeah  Do you like the song though?  No  It's kind of catchy  Fucking fake Elvis shit  Yeah  It's not bad  Who cares  You don't mind it?  Yeah, I don't mind it  Bruno Mars  Damn, that's a good stage show  I'm not a fan of gimmicks in music, man  It drives me nuts  That's why Lady Gaga drives me nuts  And now there's Nicki Minaj  Who is so fucking overrated  I know I'm out of the demo 
[02:46:00]  But I don't get it  Sam likes Nicki Minaj  To an extent  Oh, to an extent now  Oh, now that she had that shitty performance  You're backing off a little bit  The support is waning  Her performance was all over the place  I don't even know what she was trying to accomplish  She obviously was trying to get the church all pissed off  But they got bored by it too  She's trying to get Lady Gaga level attention  Without realizing that the element that she's lacking  Is the fact that Lady Gaga is actually a very talented musician and singer  Oh  And that's not there 
[02:46:30]  Like, Nicki Minaj, when she started  She went down the Lil' Kim road  And then realized that if she could pop herself up a little bit  That's a lot more mainstream  So she changed her gimmick to kind of steal what Gaga was doing  But she's not on that level of musician  So she's the black lady Gaga  Without the musical ability  Right  She's trying too hard  Did you see that big, over-the-top, red-hooded thing she was wearing?  All right, like a little red riding hood thing  Yeah  Yeah  But it looked like something Gaga would have worn  Like the village, E-Rock, nice 
[02:47:00]  Oh, the village  I was trying to figure out what that looked like  That dumb village movie  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And the performance at the Grammys was almost a duplicate of the thing that Gaga did  When she did paparazzi at the MTV Awards and strung up in the ceiling  Right  Except Gaga wasn't lip-syncing when she did it  Oh, shit, are you accusing people of lip-syncing?  Holy shit, the whole show is lip-syncing, I know  There were close-ups on her face where you hear her singing  But she's just standing there like she's crucified  But her mouth's not moving  Yeah, you look at some of these things  They're dancing and moving so much that they can't possibly be singing 
[02:47:30]  Possible  Without sounding like they got one of those oldie-time ass-shaking exercise machines on  Right  You know, there's no way you can actually hold a note while you're jumping around like a maniac  Right  Gaga was singing while hanging from the ceiling and dripping stage blood off of herself  And really singing  Performance  Oh, what a gal  Here's my real thought on Lady Gaga  I hope she, maybe next album, just blows off all the horse shit  And let's see what she could do  Without everyone staring at her Halloween costumes 
[02:48:00]  I think she would do that, right?  Like, totally dressed down and just go for it  Didn't Aguilera do that ant?  Ah, yeah  She used to be like this, I'm fucking a dirty version of Britney Spears  Dirty whore  And then decide, you know what, I don't need all that shit  I'm just gonna get up there and sing  And as much as she gained a lot of weight and likes period juice dripping down her legs  Yeah, that's her new gimmick  She could sing  Period juice  Do you used to call it that? 
[02:48:30]  Period juice?  I don't think juice ever came into it  No, you're just juicing a woman  Squeeze her  I guess, um, I know what Ant's gonna say about this one  But  No way  That Rihanna  Holy mother  Oh, I'm not gonna say anything bad about her  She is so fucking hot  Pump her up there, uh, yeah, Sam's working on it  She had kind of the Farrah Fawcett do going on last night  The retro  Blonde Farrah Fawcett hair  Yeah  And, uh, I was openly, like, fucking losing it when Rihanna was on 
[02:49:00]  Were you making noise like, oh!  Oh, yeah  Oh!  Oh, yeah  And my, uh, my, my wife, instead of being jealous, just starts openly laughing  And I'm like, what's up?  She goes, I'm just picturing you having sex with Rihanna  She would wreck you  Oh, man  I go, what do you mean with that fucking, you know, that, that hip thing that she probably would do?  She goes, she would break you in half  And she does kind of have a weird thing going on  What do you mean a weird thing?  Well, she's got that Farrah Fawcett thing, like you said, the hair 
[02:49:30]  Right  But her, her face is like, there's something mean about it  Yeah  Oh, yeah  I don't know  I don't know  She uses bangs now to cover up that big-ass forehead, which is good  Giant forehead  Oh, she's got a big forehead?  Massive  That used to be her thing  Really?  When she was, like, young  Right  She was that chick with the big-ass forehead  And then once she started  A lot of black chicks have the big forehead  Oh, where the hairline starts at the top of the middle of the head  Once Umbrella came out, she started disguising it with bangs and stuff  Really? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah  Good choice  I like her  She's going a little crazy, right?  I like her  She's getting a little  Well, she's in that Christina Aguilera dirty, dirty period right now  Yeah, but I mean, she's like  Dirty, dirty, period  And is Chris Brown and her getting back together?  There's rumors  People are saying that they've been seen in the same areas together  Then she just deserves everything she gets  Yeah, she's just stupid  Yeah, another punch in the face  There you go  Maybe she'll get mad at you again for nothing and just punch you in the face a few times  Sam, would you go there? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, yeah, I'd go there  She's pretty light  Would he go with Nicki Minaj, though?  No  Hell no  Hell no  Oh, hell no  Oh, Hannah  We got the answer to the Joe Wallace question, by the way  Oh?  He was, I guess  I'm just trusting someone, so fuck it  He was playing on the McCartney horse shit Valentine song  Yeah  Yeah, he was  With Diana Krall  I didn't notice that  Yeah, yeah  I was too busy trying to come up with a funny tweet 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I think the performance started by showing him  Hell no  Get that fucking shit out of my face  Look at Nicki Minaj  Nicki Minaj  Her fans love her, though  What's with that ass?  I guess I'm getting too old, because I don't get it  Her ass is a gimmick  I mean, I hate the girls that their ass is their gimmick  Yeah  Stop it  Good, then take your fucking pants off and let people tool it  You're teasing with your dumb ass  When she's rapping, I like her 
[02:51:30]  What about Katy Perry?  Dressed all like Smurfish last night  That blue shit  She was coming out like, oh, I'm single now, guys  Look out  I guess she  I'm a wow woman  I guess she really stuck it to Russell Brand  The tabloids are saying  Oh, yeah  She stuck it to Russell Brand good  Why, Sam?  I don't even know why  Well, the song that she debuted at the Grammys  Right  Was a post-divorce song saying, you know  What were some of the lyrics? 
[02:52:00]  I don't remember the lyrics  Is that why  It sounded like every Katy Perry song  Hot and cold, I guess  Every song she does  She pulled that song together pretty quick  Yeah  You're not a fan of Katy Perry?  I'm a fan  I'm absolutely a fan of her heavy boobs  I like her proactive commercials  You do?  Yeah, she's talking into a shoe  She's like, hello, hello  And I'm like, whoa, it's a shoe  It's just crazy  She's a crazy woman  I guess what happened was  The first song that she started with  Was from her  I don't know, that album 
[02:52:30]  That was one of the big hits of the year  Yeah  And that song was based on Russell Brand  When she was in love, I guess  You could assume so  A lot of the album was about him, I guess  Because it was a love album  One would imagine  So then they did the record scratch  And all that shit  You thought, oh my god  Technical problems at the comedy  That's what I thought  That's crazy  They got me  They sure  They got me too  They sure got all of us  And then she debuted the new song  Which is a diss to Russell Brand, I guess  Well, it's more of her saying  I am an empowered female  I am woman, hear me roar  That's the vibe  Mm-hmm  Numbers too big to ignore  Hits One debuted the song 
[02:53:00]  Before the Grammys did last night  Get the fuck out of here  That must have made the news, right?  Oh  It was on Mikey Piff's Twitter  I don't know  Yeah, that's the news  That's the news  Public domain  It's all about getting your name out there  What do you think Russell Brand was doing last night  While Katy Perry was being a big star at the Grammys  Fucking some other girl  Really?  Yeah  Not even giving a shit  Not giving a shit  What is with that?  Ooh  What are the tabloids saying?  Do dish  About how their marriage broke up 
[02:53:30]  Was he a philandering?  Well, no  They're saying they were just too different  You know  Russell Brand's sober  And Katy Perry's a bit of a party girl  Plus her parents never approve  Being that they're both so religious  Oh, man  He did dish  That's a good dish  Rumor is she wants the Tim Tebow  Because they're both Christian people  Well  Both children of the Lord  Her parents invited Tim Tebow to their church  That's how that started  Oh, really?  I think that's more a Mr. and Mrs. Perry dream  That'd be hilarious  If she just, like, pulled her pants off 
[02:54:00]  And she's standing there  And he goes into Tebow pose  To lick her pussy  It'd be like, you know  It's like, well, look  It's Tebow  And he's Tebowing  But he's licking a snitch  On the Grammys?  Well  Maybe in their bedroom  I would go on the Grammys  Yeah, I mean  If you want ratings  I would do that on the Grammys  Yeah  What else about the Grammys?  Oh  God, and we used to be friends with this guy  Oh, no  But he makes all of us sick at this point  Oh, Jesus 
[02:54:30]  There could be so many people still  I tweeted that every time I see him  He makes me car sick  I was talking about Jack Black  Oh, God  And even Jim Norton agreed and retweeted  There's something about this guy  That just drives us nuts now  Oh, God  I don't know  Is he trying too hard?  What is it?  And Jack Black  Yeah, it's this  He tries so hard to be the outrageous guy  And the wild guy  Oh, look at him  He's rock and roll  He was  His whole speech 
[02:55:00]  We have it, right?  Yeah, yeah  He's trying to talk about  You know  Hey, the cool indie bands  Play outside the building  Because I gather the Foo Fighters  Were playing in the tent outside  Yeah  That's right  Trying to say that the Foo Fighters  Is a cool indie band  Fucking a multi-billion dollar indie band  Yeah, that was formed off of a multi-billion dollar band  Indie band  Yeah, yeah  Just stop  Yeah, but who's cooler than Dave Grohl?  Dave Grohl is all right  Jack Black?  No 
[02:55:30]  No, shit  I was explaining to my wife  The old days when Dave Grohl called me an aunt  Personally  We're at AAF  Oh my god  Thanking us  For helping get his new band  As we know  As the Foo Fighters  Off the fucking ground  You didn't get his recent call?  No  Oh, because  You see, you don't accept calls  He blew us off  I got mine  He blew us off ten years ago easily  Remember the days?  He'd be like  Hey guys  Just want to call  It's like  Oh, it's Dave Grohl 
[02:56:00]  Yeah  AAF at the time  Was one of the bands  One of the bands  One of the stations  That was pushing Foo Fighters forward  I mean, obviously  They had the talent  And they were going to be  What they are today  Obviously  But they had to start somewhere  And we were  We were on that train early, man  Oh boy  I still like him  I'm not going to trash  He's awesome  Dave Grohl rules  His fucking band rules  I like him  He's a big reason  Why rock and roll is still  Did you hear what he said  On stage though  With Butch Vig?  Is that how you say his name?  Because, yeah  You know, we're working with Butch Vig 
[02:56:30]  For the first time in 20 years  We made an album with him  With Nirvana  That album is Nevermind  Oh, yeah, that one  Would it kill you to say Nevermind?  One of the biggest fucking albums  That come out in the last 25 years?  Oh, most of the people listening  Wouldn't even know  But it's almost like  He wants to really downplay  That Nirvana thing  Well, I think in the grand scheme of things  He's far more known for Foo Fighters  Yeah, definitely  Than Nirvana today  Oh, hell yeah  Hell yeah  Oh, hell yeah  How weird is that? 
[02:57:00]  It's really weird  Like, when you think about  Like, kids that are, you know  Kids, like  I'm 30  So, like, a 20-year-old  Knows him for Foo Fighters  Which is really weird  Because, you know  He was the drummer  For the greatest band  Of our generation  But Nirvana changed music  Exactly  There are probably kids now  That know the song  Smells Like Teen Spirit  But really don't know  Anything about the band  Wow, really?  I hope not  It's an oldie  It's a classic rock song  Yeah  Why would they listen to classic rock?  That song  This will kill you  20 years old 
[02:57:30]  Smells Like Teen Spirit  Came out, I think  91  Right?  91, okay  So that's 21 years  That's unbelievable  Wow, wow, wow  You think  I said this a while ago  And we don't have stats still  I don't think  Or do we yet?  This is a question  Has he sold more records  With the Foo Fighters  At this point?  Well, he must have  I mean, they've sold like  They've had eight records  Or something like that  Yeah  I would assume so  But I mean, I want a little  Acknowledgement for the Nirvana  A little bit  He goes, yeah, Butch Vig 
[02:58:00]  You know, we did a record  With Nirvana  I'm like, that  That was not just a record  That changed everything  Hmm  But here's Jack Black  Yeah, because, you know  No?  I mean, this person says no  Really?  It says Nirvana  Sold over 60 million albums  Oh, okay  Foo Fighters  Have not sold 20 million  And that was last year  Oh, damn  That's probably right  Guy says  Yeah  So you think Nirvana  Still has it?  I mean, Nirvana  Never stopped selling  I would imagine 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  Wait, is it true  That Whitney sold 170 million?  That's probably true  That's probably true  Sure  And Nirvana only sold 60?  Sure  Yeah, she's a pop  No, I know  The Bodyguard is one of the best-selling albums  Of all time  Ah  Wow  Just shows you how big she was  If not the best-selling album  Of all time  Wow  Yeah  So Jack Black  I couldn't read a lot of tweets yesterday  Because I was too busy trying to be funny  Trying  Is the key word there  And  But somebody, like, nailed the Jack Black 
[02:59:00]  Like, look, man  He's surrounded by chicks  That dispels fun  Yeah  Whoever that guy was  You made me fucking howl  Yeah, he had girls around him  And they're all going  And they're being forced to just go  Woo, woo  It was so calculated  And his dumb speech  About how cool rock is  Like, why is he  This fucking spokesman for rock?  I don't know  Just stop it  Well, here's how it went down  This just 
[02:59:30]  Had fun written all over  Yeah  Listen, I know what you're thinking  Oh, shit  Why is the Jacob's to try to just be  Inside the Grams  Keeping it closer  With his fellow legends  It's because I don't like everyone else  I'm trying to hold on to my indie cred  You step into that Grammy room  You've got a chick  You're in the cred  At the door  And it will be stolen  From the cred check room  It's sold in the back alley  Of the balmy band  This is the place to be  Outside the Grams  Because right now  The one band  That has looked Grammy in the eye 
[03:00:00]  And managed to hold on to their indie cred  Is going to walk us hard  With four new Grammys tonight  Ladies and gentlemen  To the fighters  Oh  Yeah, exactly  That's the reaction  That should have got  And then  Yeah, but I mean  That audio  You know  It might sound douchey  But he was doing lots of cool  Facial features and stuff  Yeah, I know  And the chicks  Surrounded  He had that slick red  Western shirt on  Yeah  I could have sworn he yelled  Hey, this isn't a 
[03:00:30]  Barry Manilow concert  Did you read  Jim Norton's Twitter?  He's got something  To talk about tomorrow  Oh  He ran into Steve Martin  And Steve Martin  Called him out  On what he wrote  About him in his book  What?  Fuck yeah  Jim's going to have  A story tomorrow  And then Jimmy  I think wrote something  I'm paraphrasing  That he felt bad  And that Steve Martin  Was right  Holy shit  But Jimmy was out there  For Leno  Covering the Grammys  And ran into Steve Martin  And Steve Martin 
[03:01:00]  Just flat out called him out  Holy shit  Where's the tweet?  That's huge  Steve Martin  Just called me out  For what I wrote  In my book  As he should have  As he should have  He was very nice  I feel like a dick  So now that's a yes  You know what?  Jimmy gets  Jimmy gets into these things  And then the second  He meets the people  He backs down  He gets all enamored  And just  Like falls in love  Wants pictures  And  He would probably disagree  But I think he  Might cave a little bit 
[03:01:30]  Here and there  I would have said  Fuck you Steve  That's what I think  Steve you stink  I can't wait  To hear the story  Inspector Clouseau stinks  I can't wait  To hear the story  By the way  I might be committing  Some sacrilege here  But let me tell you something  I woke up  Over the weekend  Whatever day it was  It's only two days  It's a 50-50 shot  Nah it's never two days  It's just one big  Long night  And I wake up  And

[03:02:30]  Years ago  Laughing at that shit  Growing up  Well maybe as a kid  Kid  Because anything's funny  When you're a kid  Look you fell down  That's funny  Right  I just  I watched this  And went like  There's nothing funny  About this  I don't see  I don't even see like  Alright it might have  Been funny  And he was a genius  Like Peter Sellers  They're calling him  A genius for that role  It's like  What?  Work of art  It's  I know  We protected that shit  When Steve Warren  Did the remakes  Going how dare you do this  To Peter Sellers  Who gives a shit  Good  They should have  Fucking Gallagher do it 
[03:03:00]  Really  It's that bad  I just  I did not find it  Fucking funny  Sorry  Motherfuckers  What about when  The karate guy's  In his house  All the time  Kato  With the karate thing  And then he answers  The phone  Yeah  Yes  Chief Inspector Clouseau's  Residence  Phone call for you  And the fight stops  Instantly  I don't know  I did not find it funny  I didn't find him funny  It was just  Kind of stupid 
[03:03:30]  And then I watched  Creepshow again  Because that was on  God damn  You love Creepshow  That's a fucking movie  Leslie Nielsen in there  Is just great  And  The one with  With Adrienne Barbeau  The crate  And the husband  Feeds her to the  To the monster  In the crate  Who is the guy  The husband  Oh god  He was  There it is  Come on  You got it  Any minute now 
[03:04:00]  It's  Old  He was usually  In the  No Ted Danson  Hal Holbrook  Thank you  Hal Holbrook  Hal Holbrook  For some reason  Had hair like he thought  He was 16 years old  Why did Hal Holbrook  Grow his  Big feathered hair out  Oh yeah right  Hal Holbrook  Even when it was all gray  It still was like all  Flowing  That was to get some chicks 
[03:04:30]  Get the chicks  He was getting chicks  Yeah  You know what I watched  This weekend  What  Toy Story  Over and over  And over  Is that it  And I watched  Jeremy Lin  Oh yeah  Yeah  It's that  You don't remember  When we were talking  About this last week  He's the  And he means it  And he means it  I'm like what  Who  He's the new point guard  For the Knicks  That came out of nowhere  That everyone's talking about 
[03:05:00]  Oh the Chinese guy  Yeah  All right  I thought he was  Some TV guy  He  And people  I'm like yeah  Huh  Is that what happened  Yes  Because I was bragging  That look at  Jeremy Lin  Spanked fucking Kobe  In the Lakers  And scored 38 points  But then  Then the Laker fans  Are tweeting about  That's what I see  When I fucking argue  With people  Just  Yeah  The fact 
[03:05:30]  Start tweeting that  The fact remains  The Knicks  With Jeremy Lin  Who's only played  In a handful  Of fucking games  He's only been a starter  For three or four games  At this point  For the New York Knicks  Who came out of nowhere  Scored 38 points  Against the Lakers  And the Knicks  Didn't have  Carmelo Anthony  Or Stoudemire  Yeah  This is a big deal  For people out there  They had just a bunch  Of scrubs  And Jeremy Lin  And they kicked  The Lakers ass  But of course  People have to tweet  Something about  I don't know  They were coming off  A tough game 
[03:06:00]  With the Celtics  Or something  Oh yeah  I don't know  I saw Bill Burr's  Tweet about that  What did he say  Well he said  It was one of the best  Non-playoff  You know  Regular season games  That he'd  The Lakers  Knicks  Yeah  It really was  Yeah  You definitely  Enjoyed it  I fucking loved it  People are trying  To tell me  You're not a Knicks fan  No I said that  For many years  Yeah  And I'm openly  Admitting  Because of Jeremy Lin  I'm all in again  That's all it took  I'm a big fucking fan  Of the Knicks now  Again  Look at you  Right back in it  I can't wait  To go to a few games 
[03:06:30]  And see what they can do  And I'll tell you this much  This might be a little inside  But the NBA people  Will agree with me  Carmelo Anthony  Is going to be coming back  Very soon from his groin injury  Just want to show a little  Fucking basketball knowledge  He can't be a ball hog  With his Jeremy Lin  Or the next thing  To be in deep fucking trouble  Oh shit  Let Jeremy Lin  Do his fucking thing  Carmelo  You're going to get enough touches  You'll get your points  Give him the ball  Don't do that ball hogging shit  When you come back  From your injury  Ball hogging  Hey she's ball hogging me 
[03:07:00]  Notice what's going on  Out there  Please  I hear ya  Don't fuck this up  Dave Grohl  What  He trashed everyone  For not playing their own instruments  And singing their own songs  Sam  Travis who's got this  Well he just kinda  I mean I thought it was  A good speech  He just reminded people  That you know  There's still  People out there  That actually play  Yeah  There's other ways  To do things  That don't involve  Pro Tools  How about he does this  How about he reminds everyone  That he's the last  Rock band 
[03:07:30]  He really is  They were the only band  That was like  No  Given an award  Or even nominated  For anything in rock  It's like who else was there  Really  Right  That rocked Bruce  No  As far as  Outside of like rock categories  Yeah  See because rock has  Redefined itself  You could argue that point  Whatever  But as far as a  Straightforward rock band  It's the Foo Fighters  And then  Name one  Off the top of your head  Bruce  Queens of the Stone Age  Are they still  Maroon 5 
[03:08:00]  No  But I mean  There's a ton  Of rock bands  But the Foo Fighters  Are definitely  Out there  And the most popular  Right  You gotta go with  Jack White  Obviously  Yeah  But I mean  He's too busy  Doing other  Country stuff  But that whole  Rock genre  That true  Straight  Rock genre  Is gone  The Foo Fighters  Are just about it  They're the last ones  Standing  And he  Had a little speech  To make there  You wanna hear it  Oh sure  And then what 
[03:08:30]  All of a sudden  They cut him off  Proving his point  Oh god  Listen to this  Thank you very much  Everybody  Thank you for this  This is a great honor  Because  This record  Was a special record  For our band  Rather than  Rather than  Go to  The best studio  In the world  Down the street  In Hollywood  And rather than  Use all the  Fanciest computers  That you can buy  We made this one  In my garage  With some microphones  And a tape machine  Wow 
[03:09:00]  A tape machine  We couldn't have done it  Without the best producer  In the world  Mr. Butch Figg  I haven't worked with  Butch Figg  In 20 years  We met each other  20 years ago  When we made a Nirvana record  And  Never mind  It was an honor  To work with you again  And  We have a lot of people  To thank  James Brown  And Alan Mulder  And John Silva  All the people  At Sony BMG  To me  This award  Means a lot  Because  It shows that 
[03:09:30]  The human element  Of making music  Is what's most important  Singing into a microphone  And learning to play  An instrument  And learning to do  Your craft  That's the most  Important thing  For people to do  It's not about  Being perfect  It's not about  Sounding absolutely correct  It's not about  What goes on  In a computer  It's about  What goes on in here  And it's about  What goes on in here  He pointed to his balls  One  And then  The right one  And then the left one  Ladies and gentlemen  Ryan Seacrest 
[03:10:00]  Oh man  It sounded like  He was drowning  No no no  He left too much  Of a gap there  Long live rock and roll  Long live rock and roll  Indeed  Ladies and gentlemen  Wow  They cut him right off  They cut him  Not only did they cut him off  But they did it with  One of the most popular  Songs right now  That doesn't seem to have  A single instrument in it  Exactly  Right  That's why  It was so ironic  Oh man  Yeah  How about that  Party rock

He's like  He's a DJ

He's big  That's right  Puts on a mouse head  Yep  And he's all the rage  That's his gimmick  Yeah, he's pretty popular  He puts on a mouse head  Well, I mean, he's got a  You didn't watch all the Grammys  Well, there were certain times  I turned the volume down  Because I was taking phone calls  Ah  I thought you didn't take phone calls  I took phone calls  I take phone calls on a compound show  Oh, right, right, right  Yeah, that's what he wears  I can see the S is up  Oh, he wears that  On his head?  Yeah  That's right  That looks inconvenient 
[03:16:30]  And then it's got digital display in front  And turns into all sorts of shit  Oh  Messages and stuff  Oh, okay  Well, that's kind of  That's stupid  What is that?  He looks silly  That's his gimmick  Looks like something from Donnie Darko  Why does everyone need a gimmick?  I don't know  Because Kiss was very successful  It's an attention getter  Is it?  The eyes light up  Yeah, but he wore a shirt  With Skrillex's phone number on it  To the Grammys  Which was really funny  Ah  See?  That's what got him 
[03:17:00]  Popular  Yeah  Doing wacky shit like that  Well, that's funny  If I wore a shirt on national television  With your phone number on it  I know  That would be funny as fuck  Fuck, man  Up until I killed you  Does he franchise this shit?  Because no one knows  Who's under the fucking  That's true  Mouse head  He does  I mean  I would be sitting home  His fans show up with the mouse heads  Like when you go to  When we went to Comic Con  Yeah  There was a ton of dead mouses  Walking around  Wow, man  He was a Comic Con?  I don't know if he was there 
[03:17:30]  Maybe he was one of the guys  Just dead mouses  How do you know  If you're talking to the right dead mouse?  You can never know for sure  Hmm  Uh  Saying he was on Rogan's podcast  And they showed his face  Really?  Yeah  Yeah, he did Rogan's podcast  Over the weekend  Is he cool?  I don't know  Well, that's him  That's him?  He looks like a wigger  Well, he's got that whole look  Roland's a wing  Ah  Roland just does  Chuckling  Roland, what'd you like about  Um  Bruce  Bruce 
[03:18:00]  That is Bruce  Bruce  Bruce's performance  Yeah, it was a good performance  But I didn't know the song  I hate when I don't know the song  Plus nobody was talking about it  After the show  No  No, it was just there  He opened the show  And that was  He was done  Right  And no buzz  No nothing  Like if you walked up to somebody  And said  What opened the Grammy Awards  They'd be like  Oh, the prayer  Right  That's the other thing  Yeah, the LR Corjade deal  Yeah  Bruce  Bruce  Maybe they were pissed  Because Whitney got a bunch of attention 
[03:18:30]  And Clarence didn't get shit  I know  She just drowned  Come on now  He got a full picture on the memoriam  Yeah  But I mean, you know  For like two seconds  Yeah  If Whitney decided to take a shower  Last night  Wouldn't have been such a downer  Oh, boy  Fuck, that was just in the air  The entire night  Yeah  Here's a question  So every once in a while  Stevie Wonder comes popping out  Right?  Mm-hmm  Why does everyone give him a standing O?  Because he's blind 
[03:19:00]  And he can play a piano  But isn't the standing O for the person?  Oh, I get what you're saying  I'm being serious  Oh, so he could look out and go  Ah, they're standing  When you give someone a standing O  You're like  You give it to the person  So they could see it  And go  Oh, man  You like me this much  My performance  Was this great  That you're giving me a standing O  Which is more  More than just clapping for me  They could all just sit there  And they could play applause  Through the PA  For all he knows  Right  Mm-hmm  Isn't that strange?  Yeah  Does someone tell him  He got a standing O, I guess? 
[03:19:30]  Maybe  Maybe it works that way?  Oh  Yes  The people are standing now  Where?  They'll be like  Turn around  Get not faced in the right way  I was wondering what happens  When, like, he introduced Paul McCartney  And I was wondering  What he does when  Paul McCartney  Starts singing  Like, does somebody  Have to go get him?  Oh, yeah, yeah  Someone's got to go  Out to the podium  And get him  Grab his arm  Walk him off  Well, when  When Katy Perry  Had that whole  Malfunction thing  I just thought  Stevie Wonder backstage  Walking through wires  Oh, yeah 
[03:20:00]  He's just fucking  Ripping a bunch of  Fucking cables  Out of  Equipment  What the hell's this?  Eh, shit  I don't know  Is that your Stevie Wonder?  Yeah, yeah  That's my Stevie Wonder  That's good  He does these impersonations  You wouldn't even recognize  The people  It must suck being blind, too  Because I think  If you're blind  You can't be an asshole  Because then the people around you  Could easily  Just get your back  Oh, they could punch you in the face  And you won't even know  What's coming  They could do a million things 
[03:20:30]  They could dress you in some fucking clown outfit or something  Say, no, this is your clothes  You look good  And send you outside  I'd be wincing all the time  Thinking someone's gonna hit me in the face at any moment  Just walking around 24 hours a day wincing  Like, no, don't, no  Shit, it's coming soon  Just waiting to get belted  I would just constantly make circles with my arms  Yeah, yeah  There's some restaurant in the city  Yeah  Where you eat completely in the dark 
[03:21:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah  I just found out about this this weekend  What's that about?  It's to make you  It's been around a while  How does it?  To taste the food better  Oh, stop  And then they have like  Food's cooked good at tasting  And then the wait  The waitresses or the waiters, whatever  Have night vision  Yeah  Yeah, I heard about that shit  It's completely dark  That sounds stupid  Okay, maybe it's stupid  It's stupid  You're right  I don't want to try it  Oh, you're gonna try it?  Please try it  Tell us how it was  It's something different  Is it pitch black?  Yes, it's completely pitch black  So how do you fucking see what you're eating  And see if there's bugs in it? 
[03:21:30]  Okay  Why don't you take a shit on your plate?  Then you'll know when you take a piece of shit  This can't work  No, it's been around a while  It's been around  People are digging the brush out  Do the waiters and waitresses wear like  Night vision goggles to bring shit out?  Yeah, I said that  No  Oh, they do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  They've got night vision glasses  Oh, okay  Because I was wondering how they pour water  All that  No, they've got night vision  Because they've got to lead you to your seat  And all that crap  Sit you down  Wow, that's fucked up  There's probably shit in the water, too  Oh, shit  Yeah, I don't know 
[03:22:00]  I wouldn't  That just sounds gimmicky and frightening  I'm gonna try it  Yeah  Do you dare say your meal's undercooked?  Oh, man  Do you dare say that?  Ugh  That's a bad idea  He's touching the back of your hair  Like Barnacle  Barnacle  Like Buffalo Bill  Barnacle Bill the sailor  Right, right, right, right  Or Barnacle Bill  If you go there with your chick  What happens if somebody starts feeling her up?  Yeah  I think she would say 
[03:22:30]  Hey, someone's feeling me up  Yeah, but she don't know who's doing it  She thinks it's you  Just assume there's a little love in the air  Oh, God  This is bad news  I would just walk around pushing people's heads  Travis, please do this  I'm gonna go  I wanna go  And report back to us  Seems interesting  If I worked there  I would just steal wallets all day  I'd walk around naked  All day long  And shove my dick in the girl's mouths  Like put my dick on a plate  And tell them it's what they gotta eat  Yeah, but then they'd put their knife in a fork  No, you guys go  It's finger food  I would take their silverware away  It's finger food 
[03:23:00]  And then she picks it up  And you gotta kinda move around  So she doesn't notice it's attached to you  And then it's like  Oh, you got  What you gotta do  Is suck on it a little bit  Yeah  And wait till the juice comes out  Exactly  See?  Because it's dark  She'd never know  Never  I think we're just about done  We did pretty good  Oh, congratulations to Louis C.K.

[03:27:00]  Mum, girl did good  Mum, I love you  I'm so sorry you're not here  See, that's the problem  I wish you were with me  That's the problem  That's the voice you would get in bed  Yeah  Not the rolling in the deep voice 
[03:27:30]  Well, it sounds like she's in bed  You lick my fat pussy  Lick me fat pussy in me fat ass  Would you please and feed me something  I'm bloody hungry  You're rolling in the deep  I'm fucking starving  I also want to say a big thank you to Rick Rubin  Who taught me about flighty control  And really put me  And taught me about what I wanted to be  And he made me realize stuff that I didn't 
[03:28:00]  All right, save it for the field  What was her vocal cords?  How did she hurt them?  Friction from food?  See, because she's shoving it down her face  So fast, you know  The only one that could have throat surgery  And not lose weight  Yeah  How do you figure that one out?  Yeah, how do you do that?  How do you figure that out?  Yeah, wait a minute  Exactly  There's got to be some healing there  Where you're not allowed to fucking do anything  To eating lard-flavored Jell-O  I never think I would  And this record is inspired by something 
[03:28:30]  That is really normal  And everyone's been through it  Through it  It's just a rubbish relationship  Chubby chaser  And it's gone on to do things  That I can't tell you  Like how I feel about it  It's been the most life-changing year  And I want to thank my record companies  Columbia Records  And Excel Records  And Nick Hudgett  Who signed me  He's in the UK  Oh, God, it's not  Go on to see yourself  At home  Go on to see yourself  Running a family  And all my bands

[03:30:30]  Tony Bennett fucked up one of his lines  When he was singing with  Carrie Underwood  Carrie Underwood  What did he do?  He's a groovy guy still  With his raspy voice  He is fucking  A weirdo  That's funny, man  He is a strange motherfucker  Linkin Park is still touring  What?  What's wrong with Linkin Park?

When that was popular?  Yeah  Fuck  All right  But I've heard one on you  But I've heard one on you  And I'm gonna make your way from  See me  We got Springsteen tickets  Where's the sheet?

Jesus  I need to know now  That is stupid  Either a guy came up with a great line  Or that's real shit  Yeah, he just sounds like an idiot  Okay, save it for a few  Save it for a few  Alright, um  So we go mundane or spontaneous? 
[03:35:00]  Well, this is spontaneous  It is  It is  Yeah  It's coming out of nowhere  Two tickets to the Sirius XM  Bruce Springsteen concert in New York  New York on March 9th  Good for them  I will not be attending  What?  Why not?  I just don't want to go  Why would you go to this?  It's a good point  I don't know  Oh, oh  Gave my word  I'll attend  But  If  In protest  Within the first  The first song  Better be  A fucking hit

I'm behind the pillar  I think we sat closer than Mad Dog though  It was  We sat closer than Mad Dog, Ian  Do you remember?  I think we did, yeah  Yeah, that was good  That was good placement for him  He should be behind us  He should be closer than Sway  There were a few fucking people  Closer than us  I'm like, no  That shouldn't happen  Keith Richards  Closer than us 
[03:36:30]  I understand  Jerry Seinfeld  I saw him  Closer than us  Yes  Martha Stewart  And her bitchy daughter  Oh, no  Oh, I hear not  Have you been an active  U.S. Sirius or XM subscriber  Self-paid or automotive company paid  Continuously since at least January 24, 2012  These are the questions you have to be answering out there in Radioland  So you gotta be 18 or older and then that thing I just read  And no Canadian residents  Is that the last point?

I don't know  I don't think so  They're probably under your neck  Are you serious?  I have decided on the air that I will not be going to the Bruce Springsteen show  Where is it at?  Apollo Theater  Apollo Theater, because I want my pal Roland to go 
[03:38:30]  I'm saying that right now  The past has got through like different processes  So what does that mean?  If I say I'm not going, then they're going to what?
