<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a barrage of commercials, including spots for Bosley Medical, Nextel, Guitar Center, Sam Adams Light, Blockbuster, Neil Toyota, Hollywood Tans, the Meadowlands Racetrack, OP Vodka, Subaru, FreeCreditReport.com, and XM Satellite Radio.  The hosts then launched into their signature brand of vulgar humor, discussing topics such as camel toe, AIDS, and a lawsuit filed by a woman whose vibrating sex toy was discovered in her luggage.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to their “WOW” contest, a listener-voted competition featuring photos of women, which the hosts and their webmaster judged using highly sexually charged and offensive language.  A satirical Bruce Springsteen-themed news segment provided crude commentary on current events.  Listener calls included reviews of "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and contributions to the show’s “F.U.” segment, filled with crude and offensive voicemails.  The hosts also debated the merits of various movie reviews, criticizing what they perceived as bias.

A substantial segment focused on a furious rant against a former colleague, referred to as Dave Douglas (or possibly Dave Dickless, a potential pseudonym, based on conflicting information across different segments), whom they repeatedly called a “lying sack of crap” and a “useless waste of a human being.”  They vehemently refuted Douglas’s claim of having "trained" them, detailing instances where he allegedly undermined their creative work.  The “WOW” contest was revisited, with further sexually explicit commentary on the contestants' physical attributes. Several female contestants called in to protest their elimination, leading to further heated arguments. The hosts also made disparaging comments about the contestants' cosmetic surgeries.  The show continued to be punctuated by commercials for various products, including Stacker 2, tax services, Blockbuster, Toyota, tanning salons, Coors Light, Hotwire, and WWE SummerSlam.

The attack on Dave Douglas/Dickless continued, with Opie and Anthony recounting numerous anecdotes highlighting his perceived incompetence.  They described him as a cowardly and ineffective manager who stifled their creativity, stole credit for others' work, and made numerous foolish and offensive decisions. They cited specific examples such as his removal of "edgy" content (material about the Pope and abortion), his ineffective management style, a poorly conceived charity visit to a children's cancer hospital, and attempts to force them to cater to a "highbrow" audience.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used extremely offensive language, including threats of violence and sexually degrading remarks directed at Douglas/Dickless, his wife, and daughter. They also discussed complaints from various special interest groups (gays and NOW) and meetings they felt were unnecessarily orchestrated by Douglas/Dickless. A brief, humorous phone call from Douglas/Dickless himself was included, and comedian Jimmy Schubert, an in-studio guest, contributed to the critique. The segment ended with further discussion of Douglas/Dickless and a song about a serial killer.

A phone call from "Wheelchair Fred," a recurring caller, detailed graphic accounts of his sexual experiences with men, which he claimed didn't make him gay.  The hosts and Fred engaged in explicit discussion of a specific encounter. Fred also described his use of a sex toy. The hosts jokingly suggested getting Fred a hooker or a hermaphrodite and discussed including him in a future "Sex for Sam" segment. Another caller, "Tony," recounted his girlfriend's arrest for embezzlement ($600), with the hosts making light of her arrest and suggesting her imprisonment made her more attractive, proposing her re-entry into the "WOW" contest. They also made crude jokes about airport security.  Comedian Jimmy Schubert remained as a guest in studio throughout this segment.

The show concluded with Opie complaining about airline service and flight attendants, mentioning a humorous anecdote about receiving plastic wings from flight crew and a hypothetical scenario about a flight attendant's "camel toe."  A significant part of this final segment centered on a phone call from Mike, whose wife was eliminated from a pornography-related online competition.  Mike pleaded his case for his wife's reinstatement, providing graphic details about her participation and their financial struggles. The hosts and other callers responded with sexually explicit and crude commentary about Mike's wife.  Savannah, another woman eliminated from the same contest, also called in, facing similar mockery and insults from the hosts and a caller named "Stinky."  The hosts continued discussing the contest and its participants interspersed with advertisements. The "What Did We Learn" segment featured callers sharing humorous and often crude observations from the show.  The final advertisement promoted Subaru's all-wheel-drive vehicles.

[00:02:30]  Welcome to the bottomless fifth of ignorance.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is it mango or papaya?  Now I'm getting ratings up.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings?  If we can't talk about bullying our pleasure.  Suck it up.  Walk it off, big.  I love camel toe.  They're shaving for America.  Oh, ass.  I've got to see that ass.  No!  I would definitely want to have sex with you  If you both already had AIDS  Hoppy says

[00:04:00]  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Yep.  Marijuana is the bomb. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, man.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Don't you?  That's torture.  It's torture.  It's torture.  And now. 
[00:05:30]  Today's news.  Sung by Bruce Springsteen.  Thank you.  You know, there was a problem with a mine in Pennsylvania.  A lot of guys are trapped.  I'd like to do a little tribute song about that one.  Guys in a coal mine, trapped way down below.  It was in Pennsylvania and that state borders Jersey. 
[00:06:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  They had a drill bit trying to get the mare.  Water pouring in.  Hypothermia setting in.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  Covered in coal.  And then there's another missing girl kidnapped.  She's probably dead.  Poor parents are sitting there.  They should have moved her to Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:06:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm just a common man.  Singing common songs about things everyone knows about.  Reverend Al suing HBO.  Says they made a videotape.  And the facts weren't what they were showing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Reverend Al wants a billion dollars.  A billion dollars.  He just signed a big, fat lawsuit, Wendy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:07:00]  It's about another brother on the road.  Met an untimely end.  John and Whistle.  They found him with cocaine in his system.  He had a bad heart.  What was he thinking?  He should have went to a hospital in Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  They could have saved him in Jersey, Wendy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:07:30]  You think they're going to freeze and whistle like they did Ted Williams?  Put his body on ice and store him somewhere in Arizona.  I think it's better if you take your frozen body to Jersey.  Last night, reports of UFOs over Washington. 
[00:08:00]  Well, I'm sure they meant to go to Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Mariano Rivera's on the DL.  He's got a bad shoulder. 
[00:08:30]  He plays for the Yankees, which is in New York.  It borders a state, Wendy.  You know that state?  It's Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You know Lance Armstrong's leading the Tour de France.  He's on his way to his fourth straight title on a bicycle. 
[00:09:00]  A bicycle.  He can't get from France to Jersey on a bicycle, Wendy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's the news, sung by Bruce Springsteen.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  What's up, Anthony?  Friday.  It's Friday. 
[00:09:30]  Nice.  Yes.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, including Anthony.  Yeah.  A city we don't talk about much.  Oh.  I don't know why we don't talk about them much.  We love them.  And they seem to like us a lot.  Who?  Columbus, Ohio.  Columbus.  We got some ratings from Columbus today.  And we went.  Thank you.  Weigh the F up.  Columbus.  That's how we describe the ratings in Columbus today. 
[00:10:00]  We went.  Weigh the.  Whoops.  Weigh the F up.  I could have sworn you said it at first.  Still got a ways to go, but we went.  Weigh the F up.  Yeah.  So for everyone in Columbus and anyone else outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  Why do you want me to go there?  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is this the queue?  It's not.  Can I hear Born to Run?  It's not the classic rock station.  Can I talk to the chick, maybe?  Here.  No, this isn't the queue.  Yeah, the classic rock station here in New York City. 
[00:10:30]  They're wasting six hours down in Asbury Park because Springsteen's playing today.  Oh, is that what they're doing?  Great.  That's their big thing.  Play in Asbury Park.  I hope I don't get shot.  There's plenty of shwuggies with guns in that part of Jersey.  Oh, I want...  Bruce Springsteen sings the news. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  He's back in the news himself, so why not, right?  With his new album.  You didn't get the woman suing the airline over the sex toy there, Bruce.  She had a dildo in her luggage.  It was vibrating hard.  Security made her take it out.  Hold it up and show the whole plane, Wendy.  Oh, wow, wow.  The vibrator went, oh, wow, wow.  But it didn't have anything to do with Jersey, right?  You didn't tie in Jersey with that story. 
[00:11:30]  Maybe she was taking it to Jersey.  No, she's not from Jersey and she wants to go to Jersey.  Maybe it smelled like Elizabeth.  There you go.  Oh, play the dildo, Clarence.  Oh, wow, wow.  That's a great little story.  Real quick, this woman, she's on the airplane already.  Her luggage is going to be loaded in the bottom.  I guess it was one of those smaller planes that they make you take your luggage that's a little too big 
[00:12:00]  and you leave it by the side of the plane.  So she's on the plane sitting down.  Somebody, one of the security guys comes up and said, hey, come with me.  Come with me off the plane.  So now everybody's like, what's going on?  He says, something's vibrating in your bag.  So she goes down the stairs.  They make her open up the bag.  She goes, oh, it's a vibrator.  It's a vibrator that me and my husband got while we were on vacation in Vegas.  She says, you know, rib rib, keep it on the QT. 
[00:12:30]  Please take it out of the bag, man.  Please take it out of the bag.  Could you hold it up?  She says they made her hold it up in front of him.  And she said she looked at the side of the plane that she was out on and all the passengers are looking down laughing.  Some of the ground crew is looking, laughing and making jokes.  So now, of course, she's suing.  For a lot of money.  Got the big lawsuit. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Unspecified damages of more than $15,000.  Accusing a delta of negligence and emotional distress and gender discrimination.  She said she was embarrassed.  You're not embarrassed.  You bought the thing.  And don't try to say, oh, it was a gag gift for a friend.  Those things don't come with batteries.  And the batteries are loaded in it if it was vibrating in the bag.  You know, all right.  You see it in Vegas, maybe you get a little playful. 
[00:13:30]  You buy yourself one of these things and go to town.  Accept it.  That's it.  Maybe she should sue her husband for being so inadequate she has to buy additional equipment.  Vibrating dong.  Yeah, if he was any good, she wouldn't have needed to bring that and him to Vegas.  And, you know, knowing stuff about lawyers, I'm sure it wasn't as horrific as she makes it out the same.  Like, had to hold it up.  She probably had to open the bag and maybe pull it out of the bag a little bit and say, here, this is it. 
[00:14:00]  But now the lawyers, well, she had to hold it up.  Amazing.  The pilot was laughing.  It was hysterical.  We've all done a lot of flying lately.  And do you notice that you pack your bag differently?  Because you know they're going to go through the whole thing, most likely right in front of you.  I'm freaking out.  There are always things you're not even thinking twice about and you're throwing in your bag, you know.  But now you feel violated to begin with because they're going through your personal stuff.  You know, but there's maybe that porno or maybe there is a sex toy in there or maybe there's some paraphernalia to smoke your dope. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, I'll be horrified if they go through my checked bag again like they did last time because I packed it really well and a lot of clothes.  I packed it really well.  And you know they're just going to put on those rubber gloves and make a mess of the whole thing.  There's nothing in there.  Get those x-ray machines.  Where'd they have that?  Philly?  I threw it in that thing and they put it through the x-ray machine?  It's fine.  Yeah.  Technology's there.  They don't have to dig through your underwear and whatnot. 
[00:15:00]  Her attorney said she was pretty horrified by the treatment.  She never contended that Delta doesn't have the right to investigate a security issue.  It was their total lack of professionalism.  Now, Keith brings up a good point on line eight.  If Vibrator Girl was so embarrassed, why did she bring this issue to the press?  Further embarrassment for her, right?  Right.  Would have just been gone.  And if she was a guy, this is why you don't ever take these issues seriously. 
[00:15:30]  Because a guy would have been embarrassed and then walked on the plane and waved at everybody and went, yeah, I'm a dick.  And that would have been the end of it.  Right.  Or whatever it was, it was embarrassing.  Get over it, you self-centered.  Maybe if I could speak properly.  What?  I was going to say.  I stopped myself.  What?  I was going to say sensitive and self-centered.  But I said self-sensitive.  Self-sensitive?  Because I have absolutely no talent to speak.  So I shut my little thin mouth.  All right.  Big news, Anthony.  Yeah.  We had to make some tough decisions in the back office.  That was really difficult. 
[00:16:00]  And we gave our decisions to Scott Colombo, our webmaster.  Uh-huh.  And as we speak, he is X-ing girls out of the WOW contest.  He's doing it right now?  Because we're trying to get it down to less than 100 contestants.  Yeah.  To make it a little easier for the listeners to vote.  Yeah, because there's a lot of girls.  A lot of girls.  We went through the pictures over and over again before showtime.  And it was tough.  Yeah, there's a couple.  Every time we wanted to throw a girl out, you'd take a closer look at her and you realize, 
[00:16:30]  wait a minute, she's not that bad.  Yeah.  I was a little disappointed with a couple of the decisions we had to make.  But, you know, they're tough decisions.  I'm looking now and I see a lot of X's now on the first page.  Yeah.  And finally, I don't know how Clint Howard slipped through the cracks so many times.  Because Clint Howard's got some nice cans, I think.  If you look, right?  Those are pretty nice.  Clint Howard's got nice boobies. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  You were the one that finally cut Clint Howard.  I was like, you know, what are we going to do with Clint?  We've got to get rid of Clint Howard.  We've got to get rid of Clint Howard.  And this other girl, too, a contestant, was it 17?  I mean, she had nice breast disease.  Uh-huh.  They're pretty, they're okay.  Which one was she again?  The coal miner's daughter.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sissy Spacek.  A little too white.  Sissy Spacek.  Milky white.  Yeah.  With the freckles.  So, we went through all the contestants over and over again. 
[00:17:30]  And we chopped about 25 girls out of the contest before showtime.  Scott is working on it right now and X'ing their faces out.  So, within the next hour, all the girls will be X'd out.  The need to be X'd out.  And the voting, Anthony, is going to start on Monday.  Monday.  Go to opianthony.com and you vote for your favorite wow girl.  And we're going to knock this down to the top 20.  Mm-hmm.  And then, at that point, Anthony, we are going to hopefully throw a huge bash in New York City. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  For our listeners, hopefully.  We're working out those details.  Look at all the black women that got thrown out of our contest.  What's up with that?  Any black girls representing at this point?  There were quite a few, but now I think they've...  Have they all been eliminated?  All but one, maybe?  It's just, you know, you got to X out.  Mm-hmm.  Because we saw a lot of big girls there.  The black girls.  A lot of big girls. 
[00:18:30]  A lot of droopy boobies.  Droopy boobies.  I don't know what it is.  What is it with the African women?  I'm not saying all of you, ladies.  But for the most part, the breasts don't sit very high.  I think they use heavier material.  Really?  To make their boobs, yeah.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  No.  Most of the time, most of the time that I've seen pictures of nude black women, the boobs  seem to really hang where the darker area, you know, the areola and whatnot, kind of sits 
[00:19:00]  below the equator.  Why is everyone shaking their head before I even talk?  What?  I was just going to say it's called free food.  Is that genetic?  I don't know.  I think it's actually because, like, if something's hanging lower, it's easier to put stolen merchandise  behind.  Stop.  All right.  We're going to take our first break, Anthony. 
[00:19:30]  But that's where we're at.  We X'd out all the girls we need to X out.  And I think he got to almost all of them.  I think he's working on the last page right now.  Yeah, he's just about there.  Okay.  You go to opandanthony.com to see who made it into the contest officially.  And the voting will start Monday.  We got to knock this down to the top 20 and then hopefully throw a huge bash in New York  City for the finalists.  Oh, yeah.  That'll be cool.  We'll fly all the girls that aren't from the area into New York and we're going to have  one big, huge party, Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  So go to opandanthony.com to check out who made it.  And then Monday you get to start voting.  All right?  Right.  Because we're sick of answering email from people going, how do I vote for the contest?  Finally, the voting is here and it starts Monday.  Yeah.  Go to opandanthony.com.

[00:30:00]  Hey, Mike, what's going on today?  Oh, hey, what's up, man?  What up?  What's up, Jimmy?  I don't know where Jimmy went.  Oh, man.  Business.  He did his five minutes of radio today.  I think he's surfing the web for chicks now.  There he is.  His work is done, right? 
[00:30:30]  What's up, Mike?  Yo, boys, I just wanted to say how sorry I feel for you guys.  You have to sit around your office all afternoon and look at pictures of naked chicks.  I know, and that's...  I feel really bad for you guys.  It's like going to gossips and complaining because the girls have no clothes on.  That wasn't the hard part.  The hard part was trying to sort through them and kick some out because there are pretty  hot girls up there now.  I got to go check it out when I get home, man.  Yeah.  Well, a lot of people are already yelling at us going, how could you kick out this one? 
[00:31:00]  How could you kick out that one?  I don't know.  I don't know if I could have to email you and yell at you after I get home.  They've gotten quite the scolding.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  See you later, precious.  Wait, dude.  Adam from Boston.  You guys are effing insane for throwing out contestant number 25.  There are at least 15 girls that are not as hot as her.  Come on.  Let's just all tussle each other and work things out.  And I agree with them.  Lily, contestant 25, she might not be like the best in a wow contest like this as far 
[00:31:30]  as boobs go or anything, but she's got this way of presenting it I thought was a nice slutty  appeal.  Let me see.  She's just like, she's laid out.  Look at that.  That's just an F me look she's got going.  I booted her.  I'll be booted her.  I was panicking.  Why?  I just started slashing girls off the list.  I don't know.  I feel bad now.  I think she's really hot.  But it makes a good point. 
[00:32:00]  She's got a really nice presentation, but does she have a really nice wow?  Well, some of the girls have nice wows, and I kept them in because they got nice boobage.  Right.  But the presentation blows.  Right.  So maybe those are going to be the next to go.  I don't know.  I panicked.  Like, I took one.  I passed up one girl.  I go, okay, I won't kick her out because she's got nice cans.  But the rest of it and the presentation, it's...  How about this?  You think there's 20 girls hotter than her in the contest still?  Still 20 girls hotter than her. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Oh, my God.  I think she might have made it in at 20 somewhere.  Maybe.  Some of the girls I'm looking at?  I've made a horrible error then.  Maybe.  No way, Ant.  There's, uh...  I don't know.  I think there's, like, 90 girls still left in the contest.  Yeah, but some of them are, like...  Let me...  Like, I'd have thrown this chick out first.  No!  No.  That girl is hot.  No, because now there's problems with the boobs.  Look, the gravy stains, first of all. 
[00:33:00]  The, uh...  I love the...  The area.  And they're kind of...  The girl you just showed us is definitely hotter than the one I threw out.  Right, Jim?  The stain is good.  Right?  No, the one you threw out is hotter.  What about Moose Nose?  Uh, Moose Noses?  Moose Noses.  We didn't want her to cry, so we kept her in the contest.  Okay, how about her?  Why is...  Why is this...  Hoochie Mama still in?  Why is she in?  Why is she still in?  I thought...  I thought I...  All right.  Now, she's one...  Okay, here you go.  Hold on.  I was going to throw her out.  Anthony, I'm going to make a... 
[00:33:30]  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to write a wrong.  Good morning, everyone.  Uh-oh.  Give me that number.  Number 66.  No, you weren't supposed to say it out loud.  Well, that's it.  67...  Uh, 66?  Yeah.  All right, 66 will be out of the WOW contest.  Out.  Mm-hmm.  And which one was Lily again?  Uh, 25.  25?  Yeah.  In.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  We're just fine-tuning.  Righting the wrong.  Now, we'll see how far she goes as far as the, uh, the listeners vote. 
[00:34:00]  I don't think she's going to do well.  We'll see.  She won't even be top 50.  She won't even be top 50.  Really?  Top 50?  Nope.  There's just something really, uh, hot about her.  Nope.  All right.  Everyone relax.  25 is back in.  I made a bad, um, a bad judgment.  I was panicking.  You panicked a little bit.  It's like a nervous Nelly in the back office.  We were trying to get a lot of stuff done before the show today.  Just X-ing everything out and eating healthy.  Just X her out. 
[00:34:30]  Where's my salad?  X.  Did you even look at the pictures?  Yes, I looked at them.  Just take a number and write it down.  How many fat grams?  X her.  X her.  Shut up.  I don't count fat grams.  Move my skateboard.  X.  I don't count the fat grams, dough boy.  Dough boy.  Dude, I am a...  All right.  Corey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Um, Austin Powers sucked.  Horrible.  Horrible.  My first call-in review, really?  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Here, give me the New York papers over there.  Which one, Angel?  Both of them.  There you go.  Both papers coming up.  Oh, God.  Don't...  We don't want to get silly yet.  Stop.  Uh, why did it suck, Corey?  Well, um...  I mean, you know how the second one was the same jokes as the first one, but it was still  kind of funny.  Yeah.  This one was like, watered down beyond belief that the jokes are so tired, it just, they  had to resort to putting the Osbournes in, let's put it that way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Were they actually in the movie, dude?  Yeah.  Oh, I'd see it just for Ozzy. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Well, thank you, Corey.  All right.  First guy to see Austin Powers.  You know what?  I got to tell you, though.  But this movie coming out this late in the summer, you know it's not going to be that  great.  Really?  Yeah.  They kind of had a plan to come out.  You know anything about movie releases?  Yes.  Yeah.  I was in one of the big ones.  All right.  Well, they always put the ones they know were going to kill at the beginning of the summer.  Yeah, but that was a nasty time to be putting a movie out.  There are a lot of, like, biggies that you didn't want to compete with.  But now, look, all those movies have been out a long time now, where you're talking this 
[00:36:00]  is middle of the summer, leaning toward late summer now, and Austin Powers finally  makes it out there.  I'm telling you, any movie that comes out now wasn't good enough for the summer releases.  Really?  The big summer releases.  Yeah, that's how they do these things in Hollywood.  I'll still laugh.  I'm an idiot with those movies.  Especially Austin Powers.  If they thought Austin Powers 3 was going to be really, really good, of course they would  have had it out there with Spider-Man.  Competing with Spider-Man.  Of course they would.  Of course they would.  Star Wars.  Star Wars. 
[00:36:30]  Of course.  I don't know, man.  That, ooh.  Of course they would.  Because you've got to think that movie, Austin Powers 3, is just as good as those.  Not like those.  No, no.  You've got to believe in what you're putting on the big screen.  They didn't believe in it.  I don't know.  The Austin Powers series has a little bit of history, Anthony.  Yeah.  They would have put it out there if they were feeling confident.  They didn't feel the confidence, so they delayed the release.  I would rather put it out when nothing else is really around it.  That's kind of a smart move, I think. 
[00:37:00]  Whether it's bad or good.  It's kind of a smart move.  No.  I'll still go see it and laugh.  But the New York Post has given it three stars, Anthony.  Really?  And the Daily News here in New York has given it two and a half stars.  But no one's really committing as far as the reviews go.  Everyone has read the movie reviews?  Yeah.  Sam Rubin of KTLA TV Los Angeles.  Who?  Oh, boy.  Where's the big guys?  Where's...  Rex Reed. 
[00:37:30]  Siskel and Ebert.  Oh, Puddin' Brains.  Siskel and Ebert.  It's still Siskel and Ebert.  Sam says, gold member is solid gold fund.  Oh.  The funniest movie of the summer.  All right.  Mark S. Allen, KMAX TV Sacramento.  A shagadelic triumph.  What does that mean?  That's a guy that's not really committing.  Right, right.  And how many copies are there?  Full of gut-busting, ab-crunching, fall-out-of-your-seat surprises.  Not laughs.  Oh, surprises.  Not laughs.  It says, full of gut-busting, ab-crunching, fall-out-of-your-seat surprises. 
[00:38:00]  Surprises.  Meaning, wow, hey, look, the Osbournes are...  Boom!  I'm so surprised!  If they said laughs, then I'd have a little more confidence in the review there, Anthony.  Yeah.  How about Joel Siegel?  Good morning, America.  All right.  Mike Myers is a comic genius.  Ooh.  All right.  It really doesn't comment on the movie.  That's right.  Mike Myers is a comic genius.  I think a lot of people would agree with that. 
[00:38:30]  Ooh, is he a comic genius?  A lot of people ask.  Is he a comic genius in this movie?  Or is he just a comic genius?  He just says he's a comic genius.  Richard Pryor.  Comic genius.  Right.  Yes.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What does that mean?  You know something?  That's noncommittal.  You're like Columbo.  And Jim Ferguson, who obviously was paid for his review, KMSB-TV, Tucson, Arizona.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  He did one word. 
[00:39:00]  Hilarious.  That's it.  One word.  Let's see if there's...  Hilarious gigi gigi.  These critics put certain things in just so they can get in the newspaper ads.  Yeah.  They'll put certain wording in, you know, stupendous, just so they print it with their  name next to it.  I never trust them.  They're politicians, though.  They don't really commit to their reviews.  I never trust the one word review.  Especially a movie like Austin Powers 3, where you just know it's going to kind of be on  the fence.  Some people are going to really enjoy it.  Some are going to be like, okay, it's tired and old at this point.  When they put hilarious, though, a one word review like that, and then put it in the 
[00:39:30]  quotation marks, it's like, it could be, this movie is anything but hilarious.  And then they just take the word out of the review.  Right.  Hilarious.  Right.  A little misleading, perhaps.  I'll say.  Stuart Little, too, Anthony.  Stuart Little, too.  But here's the big reviewers.  All right.  I mean, I just named a bunch of reviewers that we've never heard of from places we've never  heard of.  All right.  Here's Stuart Little, too.  Yeah.  Ebert and Roper.  Two thumbs up. 
[00:40:00]  You know exactly what that means.  Easy.  Two thumbs up.  They liked it.  Chicago Tribune.  Mm-hmm.  That's kind of a big paper, huh?  Sure.  A warm, witty, and consistently funny family movie.  The Wall Street Journal.  Heard of that.  Very respectful paper here in New York.  The sequel beats the original Paws Down.  Paws Down?  These people are committing to their reviews.  The New York Times, Anthony.  Yeah.  Visually superb.  Has even snappier action sequences than the first film. 
[00:40:30]  So they're talking about the movie.  And our old friend Joel Siegel.  Yeah.  He's reviewing this one as well.  One of the most fun family films this summer.  All right.  How many family films have there been?  A lot.  Have there?  Yeah.  So they're...  But those guys are committing.  How about this?  Road to Perdition.  Yeah.  With Tom Hanks.  Okay?  Look at this.  The number one movie in America.  The best movie so far this year. 
[00:41:00]  Breathtakingly beautiful.  A masterwork.  Nothing less than perfection.  Knocked me out.  Powerful.  A majestic visual tone poem.  But who's saying this?  Uh, pretty...  Uh, Joel Siegel's in there.  Oh, all the big guys?  Los Angeles Times.  New York Times.  The Today Show.  Uh, Film Journal.  Hmm.  And Ebert and Roper.  Two thumbs up.  Now, obviously, Ebert and Roper reviewed Austin Powers. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And I don't think it got the two thumbs up or it would be in this.  Or it would be there.  It would be there.  Hmm.  So.  Hmm.  You know something?  I didn't look into it as deeply.  That's good, though.  There you go.  Just the fact that they put these things...  What film would put anything bad?  It's like...  Why would they...  You understand?  Yeah.  It's a lie.  I know, but...  No one's going to put any bad reviews on there.  Oh, I know, but that's why I have to read around the review.  Right.  If it's all no names...  You could catch them in their own game, is what we just pointed out. 
[00:42:00]  When Joel Siegel says Mike Myers is a comic genius, what does that really mean?  Is he a genius in this movie?  Right.  Or is he just a genius because of the body of work he's given us over the years?  As far as this movie goes.  Right.  What were we going to say, Jim?  Nothing.  Just I'm looking at these.  Men in Black 2.  The review is funnier than the first.  I didn't even crack a smile during the first.  This guy, thinner than Big Kev.  Whoa. 
[00:42:30]  What does that mean?  Men in Black, the first one, was one of those movies that was so close to being great.  Yeah, you know what ruined it?  Snappy dialogue.  Stop with the snappy dialogue.  The idea was great.  The characters, I mean, Tommy Lee Jones, hello.  He's great.  Yeah.  But they just missed.  They just missed.  They took a good idea and kind of...  Will Smith's a good actor, but they always have to give him the snappy black guy dialogue.  Yeah, I...  Hey, it's raining the Negroes. 
[00:43:00]  Waka waka.  That's it.  Slappy tap dance.  Let the guy act.  He's a good actor.  You don't need the snappy dialogue.  It takes away from the integrity of what you're doing, stupid asses.  Independence Day could have been phenomenal with the graphics and the ideas.  Awful movie.  It could have been great, though.  Yeah.  With the graphics.  Visually, it was amazing.  And they're going to kick the aliens.  He's going to be saying snappy things.  That shit just ruined the realism.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Oh, and Dennis, which one of the awful Quades was in it playing the wacky guy again? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Randy Quade.  I never understand when they do things like that.  You know, there are plenty, plenty of black fighter pilots and black guys that are in  very high-tech jobs.  You will never see them flying the fighter going, yo, let me tell you what, I'll be shooting  down everybody.  Ever.  Never.  Ever.  They're on there, you know, requesting a landing at the deck where we're clearing. 
[00:44:00]  It's not like a jive-talking, hip, black guy in the cockpit.  And he's a good enough actor.  And Jeff Goldblum, I like the idea of the whole computer thing in Independence Day.  That could have been a really great film.  Yeah.  They were reaching with that one.  But you're right.  But I mean, it's some type of a thing that you could go, all right, maybe.  The scenes of the White House being blown up and all that, really, really cool to look  in.  They had to dumb it up for America, because America is dumb.  Did we just go back to the year 1997 or something?  Yeah, we're reviewing that one.  No, it's not even a review.  It's an example of a great blockbuster film that could have been great. 
[00:44:30]  We were saying Men in Black.  Oh, there you go.  There's the tie-in.  Woof.  Yeah.  The tie is right.  Will Smith.  Woof.  Thank God for Will Smith is the tie-in.  I'll bring it to the last tango in Paris somehow, if you want.  I just thought you got excited that you could get in on a topical discussion with your review  of Independence Day.  Jimmy's new movie picks.  Independence Day.  You're right.  I bet you still haven't seen Spider-Man, the movie you're in.  I have not seen it.  Oh, jeez.  You should have seen it on the big screen. 
[00:45:00]  Is it still out?  No, I don't think so.  That's in there.  Is it?  I think it's in there.  Maybe I'll go out and I'll see it soon, right, Rick?  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  Ah, there you go.  Love you, Ben.  Get yourself some popcorn.  D, what's going on?  Yo, I just got out of Austin Powers.  Okay.  This movie was about as funny as testicular cancer.  Really?  That means hilarious.  This movie...  Is that the review that some of the people are writing down?  Dude, you have to realize the testicular cancer is not the funny part.  It's the heartbroken friends and family. 
[00:45:30]  This movie was so effing bad.  I was so psyched.  Today's like Friday's my day off.  I got the cheap ticket, $5.50.  I had an Anthony moment.  I had three African-Americans, all with children, burping their babies.  And then I'm like, all right, I got to see Austin Powers.  The movie sucked.  I am so pissed.  I'm pissed all week out of the way for this movie.  Dude.  So bad.  How could you think that would be funny? 
[00:46:00]  You know, I've never seen the first or second one.  The first one was great.  The second one was great.  They call it toilet humor.  What do you mean?  Toilet humor.  How could you think it was going to be funny?  Dude, comedy...  And the whole send-up of the James Bond things and everything.  It was just...  It was good.  The first two kicked ass.  The character was funny.  It was so funny.  Of course.  This movie was just...  I'm telling you, I...  I was reading one of the reviews and they're saying it's Mike Myers pretty much starring  in SNL doing all the skits.  Oh, really?  It was just an excuse for him to do all his stupid stuff. 
[00:46:30]  And the storyline is a little weak, unfortunately.  No, it's funny, though.  When Monday comes around, they're going to say, number one movie in America, another huge  success for Mike Myers.  And it'll make, I don't know, between $60 million and $70 million over the weekend.  And then they'll...  Oh, it'll make money.  And they'll deem it a huge success.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, even though if they polled the people leaving the theaters, I bet you you'd get  mixed reviews, maybe half the people liking it and half the people saying it blue. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, but if they show those on TV...  But the headlines are lovely.  I loved it.  I was laughing.  Those people, I want to mow down.  When they bring the camera outside the theater and just...  The guy on the street interview?  Yeah.  And they're just standing out.  They go, all right, now all three is at once.  Just yell, we loved it.  We loved it.  Oh, I want a bus to jump the curb and take them all out.  And then there's the down to earth guy.  It just lasts from beginning to end.  It was great.  My children loved it.  You could take the whole family. 
[00:47:30]  And normally you don't bring kids this age to pornographic films, but I felt, hey, John  Holmes is being re-released.  I want my kids to see it.  Eddie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  I laughed.  I cried.  I got a batch on my neck.  That movie was great.  There's always the Italian guy.  Hey, this movie, I laughed so hard, I fell into cement.  Stinks.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, man, what are you guys talking about, Dad?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  We all know that.  Well, that's good, Eddie.  All right.  Anything else? 
[00:48:00]  What happened next, Eddie?  What next, Eddie?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I need a moment.  I need a moment, because I get so embarrassed.  I can't even look at you guys.  Boy, he really stirred it up, didn't he?  Jesus, dude.  God, it's 2002?  Hey, hey, bleep fast.  And then he's like, huh, huh, yeah.  He realized what a dummy he was, and he just went, uh, all right.  Yeah, well, I better go now. 
[00:48:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I saw the movie the other day.  Yeah.  It was really good.  Okay.  It was really funny.  They did rehash, you know, they did a lot of, you know, like in sequels, they got to rehash  jokes from the other movies.  Well, wait, wait, Chris, Chris, Chris.  Go ahead.  In this case, and I'm being serious, and hopefully none of these guys will do it, don't give out  too much of the movie.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But, I mean, there were a lot of good scenes, a lot of fresh stuff in it.  It was really funny.  Yeah.  The Osbournes are in it, and Jim should like that. 
[00:49:00]  Ozzy's in it.  All right.  If someone could email me that clip, I won't go see the film, but this is the Ozzy.  Just the clip.  That's all I want.  Here's a guy whose opinion we definitely respect when it comes to movies.  It's Big Kev, everyone.  He just got out of the movie.  It was no better or no worse than the other two.  Hi, Angel.  Oh, okay, so it's kind of the same thing.  I don't understand what people are expecting.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  You go in expecting Road to Perdition, and, you know, you're watching an Austin Powers movie. 
[00:49:30]  No, no, no, no, Big Kev.  I'm going to go, hopefully this weekend, and I'm expecting to laugh just as much as I did  through the last two.  And you will, because the two or three new jokes in the movie are really funny.  Two or three new jokes, huh?  Will they just rehash a lot of things?  Of course.  Just like they rehashed a lot of things in the second movie.  Right.  It's just, I don't understand what people are expecting.  People are expecting, they get, you know, they get worked up with the hype, and the other 
[00:50:00]  two movies did very well.  So, instead of thinking, all right, this is another goof movie with posse humor and whatnot,  they then start expecting that it's going to be something that it's not, and something  better.  I'll tell you what people expect, and I mean, you know, Big Kev, but people expect to be  taken off guard again.  They want to be knocked over, and once you see something, it's hard to be knocked over  and taken completely off guard.  That's why they're disappointed.  It's the third movie.  Right.  You have to expect it sucks just on that basis alone. 
[00:50:30]  All right, I'll ask you this.  How are the new characters?  They're as crappy as the new characters always are.  No, Fat Bastard.  But then they do one or two funny things, and you're like, ah, ha, ha.  Fat Bastard.  Fat Bastard was hilarious in the second movie.  Right, right.  And, you know, I'll tell you this.  Is there any new character that's going to blow you away in the third movie?  I'll tell you this.  He sucks in this movie.  Really?  Fat Bastard does?  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, Kev, is it as funny as used cars?  Is anything as funny as used cars?  Right, exactly.  Kevin gets it. 
[00:51:00]  Now, Leonard Part 6 was funnier than used cars.  The other thing I want to say is, if you're basing your movie-going experience on reviewers,  then just don't go.  So, just read the review, and that's now your opinion of the movie.  No, what I did a little exercise here, Kev, and every review for even the worst movies  is a good review.  You've got to learn how to read around the reviews that they put in the paper.  Yeah, even good reviews, though, doesn't mean necessarily that you will find that it's 
[00:51:30]  a good movie.  Well, like I said, I don't know if you're listening.  Joel Siegel writes, Mike Myers is a comic genius.  What does that mean?  That's like saying...  Is he a comic genius in this movie, or is he a comic genius because of all the stuff  he gave us over the years?  That's like saying, thinner than Big Kev.  What does that mean?  I thought you were in the movie.  Oh, you heard all that.  All right, Kev.  Take care.  See you, bud.  Well, there you go.  A lot of people are going to be checking out that movie this weekend, so...  I'll check it out. 
[00:52:00]  Hmm.  Do we have a contestant that's a little angry, maybe?  Oh, hey.  Let me look.  Let me look.  All right, we'll talk to her next.  A lot of people are very angry at our choices, but we had to knock a lot of girls out of  the WoW contest today to get it down to a reasonable size for the listeners to start  voting on Monday, Ant.  Did you take her out?  You go to I.  Or to opianthony.com to start voting on Monday?  Let me see, Ant.  All right.  Let me give you the front shot.  There you go.  You did.  You sure? 
[00:52:30]  You would have kept her in?  No.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Maybe I did.  I don't know.  The critics are always looking out for themselves.  I forget what the film was, but it was a Siskel and Ebert review.  It was so annoying, because Roger Ebert's like, I like the film.  I don't know what my partner thought, because he has pudding under his hat.  Oh, we're going to break.  Thanks for calling, and here's the opianthony F.U. line. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, my name is Phil.  I'm a stockbroker.  I want to send a big F.U. out to all the stupid motherfuckers that are taking their money  out of the market.  That's what's driving the prices down.  People say, what am I going to do?  My money's going down.  I'm going to pull out.  Stupid F.U.  You keep your money in, and you buy more.  You buy when the prices are low.  You sell when it's high.  Don't be so f***ing stupid.  Buy now.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to myself for f***ing seven times last night. 
[00:53:30]  My yambag is in serious pain, and my heat-peaking moisture missile will never forgive me for  this one.  Next message.  This is a big f***ing you, that little f***ing bitch that I've been sleeping with for a  f***ing year, behind her boyfriend's back of four years.  She finally f***ing breaks up with him, and what the f*** happened?  She'll get back in his life and f*** me over.  F*** you.  I f***ing hate you.  Hey.  End of messages. 
[00:54:00]  You want to touch it?  This isn't happening to me.  Go on.  Touch it.  I'm going to face down in a pillow.  Touch it.  With my little baseball cleats on.  Go on.  While the coaches touch it.  Teaching me a lesson.  O.P. and Anthony.  We're trying to get away from that brand of humor.  Crinkle, crinkle.  M.W.  I've got a discus in my ass cheek.  Ron and Fez.

On the line is Jonas Bolland to tell you why summertime is the time to be thinking about your taxes.  You know, summertime is the time to be thinking about your taxes.  If you want to reduce the amount that you're paying the Internal Revenue Service,  you know, and do it without raising the red flag, getting yourself audited.  You've got to do a little tax planning, and this is the time of the year that all of that takes place.  You know, the National Audit Defense Network, this is where we come in and we really excel. 
[00:57:00]  Being former IRS agents, tax attorneys, CPAs, auditors, enrolled agents,  nearly a thousand of these individuals across the United States,  we actually custom design a tax plan for each individual based on their circumstances,  based on their income level.  Basically, what we do is we make sure that you qualify for additional tax deductions  that right now you're missing.  Hey, the bottom line is, on average, we reduce your taxes about 20%,  and that's a lot of money back into your account.  The other thing we like to point out this time of the year, this is audit season. 
[00:57:30]  This is when the IRS sends out its audit notices, its correction notices,  and you've got to ask yourself, what do you do if one of those shows up in your mailbox?  Most people don't have a clue.  I mean, who do you call?  Can you afford to pay a tax attorney $200 an hour?  Well, you know, the answer to this is in our book.  It's called The Guaranteed Tax Saving System.  Now, this is a $20 book that you might have seen around in the stores and on the Internet, Amazon.com.  The book goes into detail about exactly what you should do, what you should say, who you should call, 
[00:58:00]  if, in fact, you do get an audit notice.  Plus, it has a ton of summertime tax strategies in there.  You know, we give that book away to promote the organization.  I've got 50 copies of the book waiting right now.  It's a toll-free number to give away to the first 50 callers.  All you have to do is pay your own postage.

The L.B. and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW. 
[01:03:30]  We're back with the L.B. and Anthony Show.  This is just in.  Ozzy is leaving OzFest for three weeks to be with his wife Sharon as she battles cancer. 
[01:04:00]  There you go.  He hopes to join OzFest again August 22nd in Denver.  But he's leaving the OzFest tour for three weeks.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York, including Columbus, who gave us some fine ratings today.  Thank you. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Thanks to everyone listening to us on the Big Wazoo.  Opie, a lot of people disagreeing.  Yeah, let me just get the number out.  866-277-4WOW for Columbus and everyone else outside of New York.  Go ahead, Ian.  I thought they knew that.  A lot of people are angry with some of the cuts we've made in the WOW contest.  You guys effing suck.  I would dare to say effing racists as S.  We are racists as S. 
[01:05:00]  With all the women you're X-ing out of the WOW contest,  how the hell are you going to leave a weak-ass, tired-looking bitch like Tulip106  and take off two hot sisters like Chyna51 and Janine52?  Now, well, let's take a look, Anthony.  All right.  We are fine-tuning.  I look at...  We already put one girl back in the contest that we kicked out and kicked another girl out.  So we're fine-tuning.  The listeners are going to start voting in the WOW contest on Monday at opiananthony.com.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  First, let's look at Tulip.  What number was she?  Did I say 106?  Okay.  Let's take a quick look.  This guy might be right.  Let's see.  At Tulip.  I think it was a girl.  All right.  She's still in it?  She's sexy.  Yeah.  Yeah, this girl is sexy.  She looks like Nicole Kidman.  She's got a nice fun bag.  She's milky white.  Yes.  That's not a...  That's a turn-off for a lot of people, the milky white.  I don't mind that.  Let me see the full body. 
[01:06:00]  Well, oof.  That shot's a little rough.  You know what?  Yeah.  Maybe if we axed that one picture, the rest of the picture's not bad.  But not bad on the boobage.  All right.  Not bad.  All right.  And whatnot.  So we kept her in.  Yeah.  Now she's pissed.  She's using the race card now.  Wait.  Who's pissed?  This, listen, the one that instant feedbacks.  Oh, okay.  It was a girl.  Okay.  Tashawana.  All right.  Now show us the two black girls that we kicked off.  By the way, I don't... 
[01:06:30]  51 and 52.  Let's take a look because I think...  Opie, I think I threw at least one of them out.  Okay.  Today, as a matter of fact.  Here's one of them.  Yeah.  Nice face.  She has a pretty face, but...  You know what?  She's not that bad, Anthony.  No.  No.  No.  She's not that bad.  No.  We're looking at contesting what?  Number 51 so they can play along at home?  Everything's fine.  Her boobs blow.  This girl, by the way, this girl.  This girl is barely black. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  You know what?  You can't call us a red.  This girl doesn't even look black.  She could be Italian for all I know.  You know something?  I thought I was going to see something as dark as Mickey Rivers.  Her boobs were awful.  And then here's the other one she's bitching about.  This is the one I threw out.  Dude, that girl should stay in.  No.  Look at this picture.  Her arms are up in that one.  This picture exposes her.  Look at their square.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  The boobs are ridiculous.  And their implants.  No.  She's got bad implants.  You know what?  I have to agree with the feedback, Anthony.  You know something, though?  Unlike the last one, I'm not agreeing.  You agreed last time and said, all right, I'll put her back in.  Right.  So you think that the Tulip girl is hotter than both those girls?  Yes.  Yeah.  You think the body white girl is hotter than the two black girls?  Dude, I didn't want to boot any of them.  Because you're going to hear this crap from people. 
[01:08:00]  I know, but that's why we're fine-tuning before we give it to the listeners.  We already admitted one wrong today.  Why do they have to?  They can only vote with so many in there?  Is that what the problem is?  We have 143 girls.  We need to cut it down.  Yes.  I'm not even talking about the fact that she looks like one of the Wayans brothers with  the wig on.  I just think that girl, I think, should be in the contest.  What's her number?  You honestly think she's going to make it?  Hell yeah.  The 20?  Hell yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Rick, what do you think?  Look at her bad boob job.  It has nothing to do with anything but her bad, awful boob job.  It's awful.  One is going this way, the other one's going straight in the other direction, and they're  completely uneven.  Do you feel good about your decision that you made earlier, Anthony?  I feel pretty good about that decision.  The other girl...  There's nothing I could do because I wasn't the one that kicked that particular girl out  of the contest.  Oh my God.  Yeah, see?  Wait, wait, wait.  Turn around.  That's the other girl.  Look at her.  If she had nicer boobs, she'd be in. 
[01:09:00]  If she had boobs.  They're these flattened out, saggy things.  She's got the moose noses.  Yeah.  She's got the baby moose noses working, so I'm not going to play around with this contest.  All right.  Decision stands, Anthony.  Yes.  It stands.  Now, a bunch of girls that we kicked out earlier are starting to call in.  This could be a little ugly.  Amanda.  Yes.  Contestant number what?  13.  And you're calling why? 
[01:09:30]  Just to find out why.  That you got kicked out?  Mm-hmm.  Well, you made it pretty far so far, don't you think?  Yeah, I know.  That's why I'm kind of disappointed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  Yeah.  I'm not angry.  I'm just disappointed.  You know something?  You're not bad at all.  I'll tell you that.  No.  You are not bad at all.  Thank you.  Look at that side shot.  It's really hot.  Let me see, Ant.  Oh, boy.  Do we let her back in the contest?  We cannot start letting people back in. 
[01:10:00]  Well, there's...  I don't like booting anybody.  Well, I think they should be voting.  It's part of the game.  They should be voted out.  It's like Vincey has a chance with every single one of you ladies, and he doesn't want to boot  any of you.  It's like the elections we have for president.  We cannot leave it to the public.  There has to be some kind of system and order.  Amanda?  Yes?  You're right on the fence, I gotta say.  Yeah, you were one of those that it was one of the really tough decisions, and yeah, I'm 
[01:10:30]  sorry.  Are you done taking people out?  Yeah.  Wait a minute, though.  Okay, who do you don't...  Look at contestant number 141.  All right, Amanda, this is the deal I'll make with you.  What contestant?  141.  We will go to 141, and we'll decide right now on the air if you're more deserving than  contestant number 141.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah.  Let's go to 141, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  141 is...  No, I love 141.  You do? 
[01:11:00]  Look at her boobs.  Yeah.  You know something, Amanda?  That's disgusting.  I'm looking at...  I'm with you on this one.  She's all cockeyed.  That's the worst boob job I've seen.  Hold on.  That's another bad goddamn boob job.  Yeah.  You women are effing yourselves up with these boob jobs.  You think it's hot.  It looks awful.  Go to the second picture, though.  Second picture, Anthony.  I mean, one's up in the air.  One's down.  Yeah, those look like muscular.  They're up.  They're like big pecs.  They're not awful.  We will make a vote right now.  They're awful.  They're terrible.  We will make a vote right now, because Amanda brings up an interesting point here. 
[01:11:30]  Is Amanda better than 141?  I say no.  Anthony, you say...  Let me go back to 13 now.  I'll look at Amanda.  I'll give her credit just for the fact that they're natural.  I'll give you that much.  Okay.  But you have to decide.  Let me think.  If you say yes, then the third vote goes to Jim Norton to decide. 
[01:12:00]  You know what?  I'll be honest with you.  Okay.  Her boobs, the other girl, are horrific.  They are.  They're terrible.  She has a little something else going on.  Yeah.  Now, you, you're a very nice-looking girl here and everything, but I can't see it that you're  completely above and beyond to the point where we've got to make the switch.  I'm sorry, Amanda.  Oh, my God.  Tough decision.  Very diplomatic and nice, though.  I'm just trying to say, it's not like... 
[01:12:30]  Man, you're being tough today.  It's not like she's, um...  Yeah, like, well above and beyond.  Are any of these girls going to be able to change your mind today?  Some of them, sure.  All right.  Some of them.  One girl was able to change our minds already.  All right, Amanda, I'm sorry.  Can I at least give my website out?  You have a website?  Yes.  Okay.  It's www.amandalicious.com.  Amanda-licious?  Yes.  Amanda-licious?  No one can spell a-licious.  How do you spell that? 
[01:13:00]  A-M-A-N-D-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  Dot com?  Yes.  Is it porno?  Yes.  You know what?  I think she should be back in the context of something.  The pictures there are much better.  As I'm looking now at her, oh, my goodness.  Well, I say the switch.  Oh, look at a, you're catching a face full on that scene I'm looking at right now.  Is that you?  That's me.  Where are you from?  Philadelphia.  You're a good egg.  You should give your photographer a raise if that's you. 
[01:13:30]  My husband is my photographer.  I had something in my eye a second ago.  So did she.  Wait, turn it around.  I had just seen it.  But you can't go to her website, Anthony.  We have to deal with the pictures that were taken by the radio station.  Well, can I go back and get them taken over?  That's not her.  That's you?  That's me.  That's you where the guy's doing that thing there?  Oh, wait.  What guy's doing what thing?  No, no, no.  Get into her site.  That's an enlargement thing.  Okay. 
[01:14:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm looking at.  Is that you with the big, uh, the big, uh.  Amandalicious.  Dot com.  All right.  Let me click on this picture.  Wow.  You're a good egg.  There she is.  That's you?  Yes.  You're a good egg.  Nice technique.  Thank you.  That's you gently cupping with your hands and working your, uh, your head.  Looking frightened.  You have a sink in the background.  Well, you got your website out there to 20 cities, Amanda. 
[01:14:30]  But you won't put me back in?  No, Anna's already said no.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  And I'm going to go whack my bag looking at your website.  There you go.  All right.  Amanda is out.  Nice.  All right.  Another girl that we kicked out of the contest is calling in.  Savannah, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  Well, let me, let me, let me take a look now.  I spoke with you guys last week.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Angel Face.  Just so everyone can play along at home at their computers.  Contestant number 135.  Yeah.  Let's go to 135.  Kicked her out.  Yeah.  35.  Oh, right.  You're the finger in the mouth girl making it look like you were going to vomit. 
[01:15:00]  Let me see.  Take out the one shot.  I'm sitting here pacing, listening to a man delicious.  Yeah.  All your decisions so far have been right on the money.  All three girls were atrocious.  Take out the one bad shot of me, and you got top 20 best looking breasts on the contest.  All right, Savannah.  I don't want to be put back in.  I just want to.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  I am glad that Savannah called back, because we've been arguing about her for a while.  Turn that picture around, Anthony.  The first one or the third one? 
[01:15:30]  Savannah.  Yes.  We will give you, unless you have a number right now, we will give you like five minutes  to try to come up with a number that you think you're hotter than that's still in the  contest, and then we'll decide right now if we'll put you back in.  88.  Oh, she's got a number.  88, 89.  Hold on.  No, you've got to pick one.  Well, 80.  Wait, wait.  I'm sorry.  Hold on there, potty mouth.  I'm sorry.  All right, you've got to go.  Give us the numbers.  Is it 88 or 89?  Oh, my God.  Hold on. 
[01:16:00]  Hold on.  Let me help you.  88's cute, but her boobs are in her throat.  Let me help you out.  Okay.  That ain't going to wash.  Go with 89.  Go with 89.  That ain't going to wash.  Ovi, look.  Don't go with 88.  Yeah, you're not.  But 88's boobs are so far up her chest.  I mean, it's just a terrible boob job.  Let me tell you something.  They're not huge.  It's a kind of, you're right.  The boob job's bad.  Very bad.  But they haven't been made so big where it then gets ridiculous.  Okay. 
[01:16:30]  Well, then, can I?  Oh, God.  This girl is hurting.  Number 91 is hurting.  Hold on.  Savannah, you're panicking.  Get a hold of yourself.  All right, listen.  Settle down for two seconds and relax.  Like I said, we'll give you five minutes.  I'm going to put you on hold.  Okay.  Look at all the pictures.  Oh, you guys are the best.  All right.  You find a girl that you think should be booted and you should be put back in.  We'll decide.  Okay?  Okay.  But you're panicking.  You're panicking.  Yeah, you're like 88.  You can act like a man. 
[01:17:00]  What's the matter with you?  88's not going to get the job done.  89's not going to get the job done.  She's really panicking.  All right, hold on.  You got a few minutes.  Hold on.  All the pictures will go back to Savannah.  Take a deep breath, would you?  Well, give her a chance to get back into the competition.  She was freaking out.  90.  91.  Almighty.  Crandon handled the questions better.  Ed Norton.  Ed Norton.  That was really not handling things well.  And our listeners are not helping us out here. 
[01:17:30]  They all have questions about why we did this and why we did that.  It has different tastes.  Tony, what's up?  Hey.  Look, man.  How did you take out number 34?  She is so hot.  Let me look.  Let me look.  I mean, she just has that come and do me look.  I mean, come on.  34?  Yeah.  You're kidding now, right?  No, I'm not kidding.  Which one?  Candy.  Oh, yo, Candy.  I like Candy.  We like Candy.  Look at the lips, man.  Come on. 
[01:18:00]  I think she's sexy.  We like Candy a lot, but we had to make some tough decisions.  Oh, come on.  She's a faithful listener to the show, and I think she'll understand.  Yeah.  She's a little thick up top.  No one's knocking her.  She is hot.  All right.  No one is saying she's not sexy.  I think Candy is sexy.  Sorry about that.  Let's go to Carlos.  Hey, Carlos.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I don't understand how you took out number 14, and if you compare it to number 19, come on. 
[01:18:30]  Now, 14 has a nickname.  Clint Howard.  Oh, 14 is Clint Howard?  You're all hot for Clint Howard?  Oh, dude, she is hot, man.  Look at those breasts.  All right.  Let me see.  You know what?  We said, you know something?  Let me see Clint Howard again.  We said she has really nice boobies.  Are they natural?  There you go.  They look very natural.  I like Clint Howard.  I like Clint Howard.  Clint Howard, not bad.  Check out the last picture.  It's great.  Let me check out the last picture.  That was Ant's decision today.  I said, are we still, we got Clint Howard in. 
[01:19:00]  Compare that to number 19.  Dude, those are really nice natural boobies.  Compare it to number 19.  We don't have a lot of natural boobies left in this contest.  I know, man.  You have a senior citizen in 19, man.  Or 19.  You may be able to sway Anthony right now.  Let's see.  19.  Yeah, I wasn't too hip on 19.  Turn it around, Ant.  Turn it around.  They're a little.  I like her, too.  Oh, you know what?  I argued 19 with Anthony, and that's the reason she's still in.  She's one of those that was like, she's out. 
[01:19:30]  I'm like, no, but look.  Look at this.  Look at that.  You know something?  I think 19's hotter than 14.  Maybe, but 14 has gotten natural, nicer.  14, really?  Yeah, if you could get over the Clint Howard aspect of the whole thing.  Yeah, but this lady looks like she belongs in a nursing home, man.  How many contestants do you have?  Do you have 90-something?  We don't know.  Jim, there are 387 contestants now that we have to list.  Let's put it this way.  If contestant number 14 calls us and she could find a woman that's uglier or whatever, we'll 
[01:20:00]  be the judge.  We'll be the judge.  All right, if she's listening, go for number 19, man.  All right, thank you, Carly.  All right, thank you.  I like her.  Because we can't let the guys do that.  We'll be here all day.  I got it.  Dude, 22, what about 48?  No.  Because there's someone for everyone, as they say.  If the girls are listening, they got kicked out of the contest, and they really, truly believe  they should be back in, they call up, and they point out a girl that's still in the contest  they think they're better than.  Okay?  The girl with the drink has been in just because she's got the drink, isn't she?  She's got some rack on her, but from Chicago. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, there's a little something going on.  She's wearing a mood ring, and she's in a very good mood because it's bright blue.  Drunken lunatic.  Yeah.  She's flashing.  How do you toss her?  You can't.  All right, let's go back to Savannah.  Savannah?  Hi.  All right, what's up?  Sorry.  Contestant 135, she got...  My computer just recently updated to out and seeing all the girls you booted out.  Earlier today, these weren't up.  Right.  All right, well, let's all relax.  Have you ever...  Well, you don't need to look at the girls that are booted out. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I know.  All right, so it's 135 on the phone.  She's trying to figure out who she's hotter than that's still in the competition.  Now, when you say this, this is going to be gold.  Okay.  You've got to make a decision.  I'm trying to decide between two.  Oh, tough choices.  Well, I think there's many more, but I see where you guys are coming from.  Yeah.  All righty.  Oh, my God.  Well, you've got to make a choice now. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, don't be so harsh.  One sec.  Oh, my God.  Put me back on hold.  She's really trying to...  She's making her time.  All right, we'll put her back on hold.  Let's go to Scott from Vegas.  Hey, Scott.  Hey, what's going on, One?  What's up, Scott?  I can't believe you guys got rid of that 124.  I mean, he was hot.  He was the best thing going on.  124 is still in, you nut. 
[01:22:00]  What are you talking about?  128 or 124?  Thank you, Scott.  You added nothing to that.  Oh, 128 was the guy.  The guy with the bad boobs.  Savannah.  Yes.  It's time for a decision.  I'll say.  Okay.  For sure, she might not be atrocious, but for sure, mine are better.  She's a little nervous.  I am.  I am.  What's the number?  Lack of confidence?  Give us a number.  Here we go. 
[01:22:30]  You guys made me this way before this.  I thought I was, you know, had a beautiful chest.  I think you do.  I think you do, too.  Absolutely do.  You're one of the girls who've been arguing over for a while.  A lot of tough choices.  Come on, Savannah.  Shoot me down.  I swear I'll cry.  We should just keep you out of the competition because you're annoying and you're wasting  time.  I'm sorry.  What's the number?  All right, 19.  Number 19.  As we scroll down and look.  We already know what she looks like.  Oh, that one.  You did that one. 
[01:23:00]  I know.  Why would you go back?  Is she already out?  Let me see again, Anthony.  If you take out the first shot of mine, it's one of the best that's on there.  Ah, we know the first shot story.  I like 19.  I mean, I just don't.  I like 19 because it's all natural right there.  She's sexy, 19.  Are you nuts?  That's why I didn't want to pick someone with natural because that's why 88 I thought was  just bad.  Oh, how about the one with the big tattoo on the side of her boobs? 
[01:23:30]  I can't believe she's still in there.  I can't believe that one either.  Yeah.  And number 115.  Oh, she's already in.  Savannah, you pretty much blew your chance.  You blew your chance.  You know, I don't even want to be put back in.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  You blew your chance.  I just don't understand how you guys are keeping, like, I say number 88 and 89, 88's  boobs are up in her neck.  I mean, it's just a terrible boob job.  I feel bad for her.  I really want to tell her, go get them fixed. 
[01:24:00]  Savannah, that girl's really hot.  She's cute.  And 89?  I agree.  88 and 89 are two, right?  89.  You don't like these sexy girls.  89 has a cute face.  I just think she has a bad boob job.  You're delusional.  That girl's really hot.  Well, her boobs are a little odd.  I don't like it.  They're a little odd, her boobs, but the side view looks much better.  Side view.  You guys tend to like all of the naturals, no matter what, you know.  I like fake, too.  Savannah?  Yeah.  One of my favorites is from Philly.  You blew it.  You're out of the wild.  It's okay, guys.  Don't worry about it.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  Thank you, though.  How about 84?  How about this?  Okay.  How about 84?  She's just shouting out random numbers.  16 comma, 32 comma, 41.  It'll relax.  Oh, God.  She has got such a point about 84.  You know something?  If she would have picked 84, I would have thrown her out.  Tammy Faye Baker?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Why didn't she pick 84?  If she picked 84, she would have been in.  She blew it.  I'd throw her out just for that awful wazoo sign in the back.  All right.  We got another contestant on the line. 
[01:25:00]  Contestant number 24.  Hey.  I want to commit Harry Carey.  I'm McHale from WYSP.  If you were a hot dog, would you eat a hot dog?  You are not contestant 24.  Come on.  I kind of look like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little bit wearing a cop's hat.  Come on.  Kick me off.  Come on.  Do it.  I'm here.  Kill me.  I'm here.  All right, Pablo.  All right. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  All right.  Awful Arnold.  No, that's pretty sexy right there.  Well, there you have it, Anthony.  Yeah, I agree.  I agree, Ant.  Yeah.  We start voting on Monday.  Let's check into our room.  Look at those picks.  We're going to try to get it down at the top 20 in the next couple weeks, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  And then we're throwing a huge bash in New York City for all the girls that made it.  Okay.  That's right.  And any of the girls listening that got kicked out of the contest?  Plead your case.  You can plead your case live on our show today.  You've got to pick a girl that's still in the contest that you think you're better than. 
[01:26:00]  And we'll make a quick decision.  Switcheroo, maybe.  Maybe.  We did one already today.  And there will be a big party for the 20 who make the finals.  And for those of you that don't make it, you can come and hang out in the parking lot  while listeners throw vomit and dog feces on you and yell, loser.  There's still listeners of the show.  I'm just kidding.  We love them all.  Dude, I'm kidding.  I don't want to boot any of them.  All right.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the Ovi and Anthony show.  Sex for Sam.

[01:36:00]  Someone looks like he wants to bite someone's cheek off.  Oh, that someone is not Opie today.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony shoot.  A couple phone lines free in New York.  877-692-1027.  I just hung up on a lot of people.  Sorry.  Trying to move on with other things here today.  All right.  Someone is boiling.  We need a rebuttal. 
[01:36:30]  Well, we can rebuttal today live on the show.  Our, uh, our, uh, old, uh, old pal there, uh, Dave Dickless.  Do you remember him?  The guy that we, uh, systematically destroyed his career and got fired from his, uh, cushy job.  That we were the reason he was there for that long.  You know, that job?  That we got him fired from, and I could not be happier that we were directly responsible for him being fired and now being out of work. 
[01:37:00]  That guy stationed up there, uh, AAF in, uh, Worcester, Worcester, Mass.  The one that the only reason they were a blip on the radar screen in Boston was because of what, uh, Opie and I were doing when we were there.  That guy seems some, some rag gave him an interview. 
[01:37:30]  And, uh, this guy, I, he's, he's taking credit for everything that's ever been done in radio.  I thought someone had already done that.  What a horse's ass this guy is.  There isn't a good enough death.  He is completely...  Delusional.  ...taking credit, yeah, for, for everything that was going on when, uh, we were there and the station was, you know, a hot commodity. 
[01:38:00]  Was?  Was.  Absolutely.  And then everybody that did anything there worth a crap left.  There were quite a few people.  They left.  And, uh, he sat there and rode the wave of hard work that, that people had put into, uh, into the station.  Until, well, we came back to town.  The wave ran out.  It hit the beach.  And he got his ass finally thrown out of there like he deserved. 
[01:38:30]  He left this nothing, this useless waste of a shell of a human being that does nothing.  He is, he is, he is useless.  Please, any, any stations listening that this guy applies to, just give us a call.  We'll tell you what a lying sack of crap and a nothing this guy is.  I want him destitute.  He is, um, he has a few quotes in this little interview that he did about how he trained you and I, Opie. 
[01:39:00]  He trained us.  The talent that he initially saw, he was able to work with.  What talent that you saw?  The talent that you walked up to Opie and told him,  why, Anthony, maybe, uh, I should, uh, be thrown out and bring in a skippy, slappy, or whappy to put with Opie?  Yeah, he did say that.  He did say that.  This jack-off.  Right before the show, Ann. 
[01:39:30]  Right before the show.  In the coffee room, he did say that.  That, I know!  That is, is working with the team and, and, and putting us on the map?  Because he didn't understand, because I was the old salt in the business.  And you were a, you were a new, up, up and coming young lad.  You had nothing, nothing, but, you stood in our way, you jackass, you useless waste.  What was the exact quote?  I just want to savor it and, uh, and, and enjoy it. 
[01:40:00]  Uh, uh, Albie and Anthony, uh, was there during their first Boston stint.  Douglas arrived at AF a month after the duo were brought in by a real program director.  Not a, a, a brainless buffoon that you are dickless.  I helped train them to become better at what they were already naturally good at.  And there's no question that they have a huge, uh, tremendous amount of talent.  It's unfortunate they felt the need to step on so many people on their way up. 
[01:40:30]  Step on so many people?  Just because your empty head was used as a step, you dick.  We had to kick you out of the way.  Step on people.  You were a hurdle to be jumped over to try to make something of our, our, our show.  Every idea that we, we came up with, this guy stood in the way and said, no, can't do.  Can't do.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Is that working with us as a team? 
[01:41:00]  Well, we got this great idea.  Whip them out Wednesday.  We got stickers.  We got things going on.  We got people putting signs.  It's a tremendous exposure.  It's a great event.  People are seeing boobs.  It's making news.  Stop doing it.  Oh, wow.  Is that how you work with talent?  That's great.  He, he's responsible.  I think our careers kind of took off after we left Dave Douglas's watch.  Yeah.  When we told him to go F himself like other people don't have the balls to do.  What a pussy. 
[01:41:30]  What did he do to help us?  Why didn't he, nothing.  Why didn't he list those in this little interview?  Who did we step on on the way, uh, way to the top?  Dave?  Who?  Who's C did he suck for this interview?  He must have made some impression by just cupping, cupping sack.  And that's the only way this interview could have gone this way.  Where, where they believe the fact that, oh, I'm also proud that the, the AFCDs were released 
[01:42:00]  during, uh, his tenure.  Who started that one?  What, what duo, what on-air duo had a bitch and, and complained to your sorry ass that  that we wanted to put a CD out.  And when it became successful, you felt the need to put every other hack on the station  on another CD.  Whose idea was that?  That real rock TV.  That was Brucey Mipman. 
[01:42:30]  And that little faggot Ian.  That was their ideas.  Not yours, Dickless.  It was little short midget Bruce and that faggot Ian.  He, they came up with the idea.  Not you.  It had nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  Nothing.  A little local show we did in Boston many years ago, many years ago.  On the Spanish station.  This guy is taking credit for breaking artists.  We have TV credits, Jim.  We have TV credits.  You did nothing.  I mean, please, please, any station, even thinking about talking to this guy, call us. 
[01:43:00]  Because we will give you the complete lowdown on this nothing, zero, zilch.  I would love to talk to the person.  Are you still dating, Dave?  Whoever did this article?  Are you still dating?  Does he just lick your taint?  And just suckle the balloon knot?  What does he do?  What the hell did he do that you bought this line of crap?  Line of crap.  He's probably going to have a lot of interviews in the trade magazines. 
[01:43:30]  List all the things you did to help the O.P. and Anthony show.  I would love to hear this.  He worked with us.  He worked?  Where did you work with us?  Our old boss, Bruce, knows the real story.  We used to complain about your sorry ass on a daily basis.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ron Valeri hired us.  The real deal.  Not this empty suit, empty head, 70s porno looking deuce satchel. 
[01:44:00]  You suck.  Oh, I'm just looking at his picture on this article.  I want to kill him.  Well, we got you fired, Dave.  All that working with us made us so happy that we, we got you fired.  We knew about it before you did, you worthless piece of crap.  And we stepped on a lot of people that turned their backs on us after we got fired.  Right.  You don't mention that.  Oh, why do they have to step on people?  Step on people? 
[01:44:30]  We got the, you were selling us down the river so fast to save your own ass.  But that came back to haunt you, didn't it, scumbag?  Came right back to haunt you.  You turned your back.  You sold us down the river.  You, you pled ignorance, which is easy for you, you dope.  And, and we were out the door.  Problem solved.  No more O&A.  Oh, but we come back.  We came back and in no, no length of time at all made you look like the ridiculous ass you are and got you thrown out. 
[01:45:00]  Now you're an out of work piece of crap.  And I will, I will spend any spare moment I can to let everybody know what a, a, a useless, useless person you would be at any station.  And now he's using our names to try to get, uh, a new job.  Oh, he's talking about all the teams.  He worked with, uh, the Hillman over there.  He was there long before you got there. 
[01:45:30]  And, and Rocco.  Rocco, you ruined any, a minuscule shot he might have had of doing anything by firing his, his partners that were doing all of his work.  Good move.  You're a genius, dickless.  I, please, please no one hire this guy.  I want him to go through his savings.  I want his kids to have to turn tricks on the effing street to support his sorry, sorry ass.  Daddy, I only made 20 bucks today. 
[01:46:00]  I'm not as tight as I was.  He's a liar.  He's a lying sack of crap.  And anyone thinking of hiring, please.  And whoever wrote this rag, detach your face.  Detach your face from Dave's ass.  Get out of that 69 and, uh, give us a call.  And we'll give you the real deal about what this nothing was about.  All right? 
[01:46:30]  Thank you.  Ass.  He made us, though, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy was nothing but in the way.  Nothing.  He, I cannot think, usually there'd be one thing you could think of.  All right.  Well, there was that one time where he did this, that.  Nothing.  Every step of the way.  Remember this.  From us getting from seven, eight years ago when we hooked up to now, uh, or until we  got fired.  Every step of the way, he was in the way.  Remember the time we were putting our CD together and, uh, we fired him from the project? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, is that when he came up and goes, think of me as the third member of the Opie and  Anthony show?  And we laughed in his moronic 70s porno face.  During the show, you went into production.  I remember it like it happened yesterday and you got nose to nose with the guy yelling  and screaming because of, yeah, taking out all the funny stuff.  He was taking out the funny stuff because it was too, uh, it was too edgy.  Oh, stuff about the Pope.  You can't talk about the Pope.  You can't talk about abortion.  There was Pope and an abortion thing, like a bit that was going on in that. 
[01:47:30]  And his wife, because he's a pussy with nothing, his wife makes him do things.  So if you, if you're thinking of hiring Dave Dickless, remember his wife will be programming  your station because this guy doesn't have a set of balls to stand up to anybody.  He's a worm.  He's a weasel.  He's a nothing, a nothing.  He did nothing.  Any hard work that was done at that station was done by other people that were long gone. 
[01:48:00]  He rode that wave.  And when someone finally turned around and looked and saw what he did and saw it was  nothing, threw his useless ass out the door, useless, made up, sat with us.  What did he do?  What is this?  He worked with us.  Oh, I helped train them to become better at what they do naturally.  Train me. 
[01:48:30]  Trained me.  This is how you do Tom Brokaw.  Trained.  Repeat after me.  There was no training.  There was nothing.  Every meeting in your office was a waste of time.  Everyone laughed at you, you ass.  In his meeting rooms with his big chalkboard and his chalk.  What does this word say?  It's passion.  We have to have passion.  People were laughing.  I swear to God, people were laughing at you. 
[01:49:00]  Your employees were laughing when you left that conference room.  You would turn your back.  We would all look at each other and laugh at your moronic frigging methods of management.  You stink.  Remember the scale?  Oh, his analogies.  Scale, you have to balance your show out.  Shut up.  Everything he did was detrimental to the Opie and Anthony show when we were there. 
[01:49:30]  Everything.  I think we've proven that.  Our careers kind of took off after we left.  After.  After we left.  Oh, let me.  You're right.  I got to talk to Mr. Dickless.  We were laughing at you.  You're talking right at the picture?  After we were laughing at you, you left the conference rooms after all of your big staff  meetings where you wrote the word passion up on the blackboard and we all stared at it  like, what is this retard trying to say?  The station needs passion. 
[01:50:00]  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  What does that mean?  We go in there from three to seven and be passionate about our program.  What a dick.  Loser.  I hope you're destitute.  I hope you lose your car, your house, your wife, your kids, everything.  I hope you never get another job because everyone knows what a lying, nothing weasel you are. 
[01:50:30]  I hope your daughter brings a big black man home.  I hope so.  And he rails you.  And he just bends you over and rails you.  I taught him everything he knows about AFing.  Jerk off.  Ugh.  But please, keep the mustache, Dave, please. 
[01:51:00]  Ugh.  Yeah, it went so.  Well, didn't he defend you against special interest groups, though, when they would complain?  Oh, the gays when they would complain?  Why?  Oh, my God.  The place looked like...  When gays complained, we could know the next day we'd come in and be at a meeting that looked  like Cherry Grove on Fire Island.  There'd be wall-to-wall gays.  And we'd have to sit there and they'd hand out pamphlets. 
[01:51:30]  Dittos.  Dittos and gay pamphlets.  And we'd sit there looking at them and look at Dave, look at despicable douchebag Dave,  wondering, why are we exposed?  Why do we have to do this?  Why are we meeting with gay groups?  Because we do a bit about gays.  Do you want to meet with gays?  You want to bend over and be railed by gays?  Whatever you would want to do, Dave, that's your prerogative.  He stood in our way, again, there.  Any funny story that would come up that was gay-related? 
[01:52:00]  No, guys.  Please.  Now we've got to play it.  Why was that, Dave?  Now we've got to play it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, let me hear its voice.  What about the NOW organization, Anthony?  Oh, National Organization of Women.  They call up.  All of a sudden, we're getting pamphlets and this.  WOW is stopping.  We can't talk about issues with women.  This guy did nothing.  And me and Opie turned around and just told him to go F himself.  F himself. 
[01:52:30]  The pie idea when we were fired.  I don't know.  That might have been Brucie.  That's just zany enough to be Bruce Mittman.  Am I stepping on you now, Dave, to get somewhere else?  Get to a higher place?  Am I stepping on you?  His idea was the cancer kids, though.  To use the cancer kids to help you.  Again.  Another idea where we just went, you go F.  You think we're awful.  Even we knew.  Even we knew that that was a bad, bad idea. 
[01:53:00]  Listen what this despicable scumbag wanted us to do.  We were getting fired.  Is this how you helped us, Dave?  This was him trying to help us and save his own ass and save the Opie and Anthony show because he knew he could ride that.  This was everything he was trying to do.  He made us go to a cancer hospital with cancer kids to give them pies and sent news photographers down there to take pictures to make us look good. 
[01:53:30]  In the days after we pulled the mayor's dead gag.  It might have been another one of our problems up there.  Oh, whatever it was.  I don't know.  I just know that pies were involved because it was supposed to be the pie throwing pies.  All I remember is sitting around watching a little, I mean, gorgeous little blonde haired girl singing Silent Night.  Looked like Cindy Lou Who.  Swear to you.  And she's just hitting every note.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there like, hey, this is all right.  This is a cool way to, you know, spend the afternoon. 
[01:54:00]  And then one of the counselors had a whisper in my ear, you know, because I forgot what it was.  I guess it was around this.  I guess it was in the spring or something, right?  Yeah.  She goes, you know, that girl, she's not going to make it to Christmas.  It's like, oh, great.  And then the photographers.  And then the pies arrived.  Yeah, the pies.  So the photographers come in and we went outside.  Me and Opie went outside the hospital.  I said, you know something?  I am not doing this.  And we didn't.  I go this.  And we told the photographer, go away. 
[01:54:30]  We'll hang out.  We'll do whatever, you know, for the kids and stuff.  But for this scumbag, Dave Douglas, to come up with an idea that all of a sudden the press is going to barge in and photograph us doing a nice thing to save his own ass.  That's his solution.  Adrian, you're a scumbag.  I could only wish horrific things on this guy.  And now he's using us again.  Fired, Dave.  We had you fired.  Because a potential employer is going to read this little article on Dave Douglas and go, oh, wow, he helped Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:00]  Because, I mean, we've got a name in the business now.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, I know.  Those guys.  Dave is hooked up to them.  Wow.  And he's not going to become what they are today.  No.  I better call this guy.  No.  We need to interview him immediately.  He has nothing to do with us.  Nothing.  Nothing.  No.  People at other stations, you want hamburger.  Dave is a big pile of steaming, fly-ridden crap. 
[01:55:30]  He's nothing.  I want to talk to the person that did this interview.  I absolutely want to talk to that person.  He didn't even have the balls to confront us after we got fired.  No.  No.  Oh, what?  Not one phone call.  That's how you take care of your people.  Oh, one phone call.  There was one.  When you go into that meeting.  Oh, that was before we got fired.  Yeah.  When you go into that meeting, make sure you say, I knew nothing about this until, shut up.  And then once we got the boot, not one phone call. 
[01:56:00]  That's how he takes care of his people that he works with.  Good.  I want to know who this interviewer is, and I want rebuttal time on this ass wipe.  I want just as big a friggin' space, a page, whatever it is, to say my piece on what the  real deal is with this nothing, this useless programmer, this do-nothing, rode a wave that 
[01:56:30]  other people made.  John Osterlin, the Ozone, was the music director there.  He had all the relationships with the record labels and the artists.  He went out and partied with them.  And you sat there and took credit for breaking bands that that guy knew were good.  And that guy broke.  Not you.  You sat there and took credit for what we did, for what he did, for what promotions did, for  what everyone did that worked at that station at that time. 
[01:57:00]  And you took all the credit.  When, meanwhile, you were just standing in the way, Dave, I am so, so glad you're out of  work right now.  I'm so glad they finally realized and booted your useless ass out the door.  I could only hope it lasts forever.  Forever.  Well, we got to play this now.  Great.  Let me hear his great friggin' voice. 
[01:57:30]  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to, uh...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just, uh, wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of  hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're, we're going into the gay zone and, uh, we all know where that, where  that leads.  Wouldn't you agree? 
[01:58:00]  Not really, but...  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky, licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun, but you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not, not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See ya. 
[01:58:30]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, you know, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Oh, yeah.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all, you know.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Huh.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road.  What you doing, what you don't.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah, it's fun.  Going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Going into the gay zone. 
[01:59:00]  Not really.  Going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  I mean, pokey, pokey in the butt.  I mean, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  Yeah, it's fun.  Licky, licky.  Yeah, it's fun.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Da, da.  Not really.  Da, da, da.  I don't mind being tied up.

[02:08:00]  Yes, Lynette.  Tempur-Pedic's new weightless sleep technology makes other beds obsolete.  It's recognized by NASA, certified by the Space Foundation,  recommended worldwide by over 25,000 sleep clinics and health professionals.  Starting where NASA's anti-G-force research ended,  Tempur-Pedic invented temper pressure-relieving material,  an otherworldly sleep surface that uses weight, shape, and body temperature  to mold to your every curve.

[02:09:00]  We can see how you're still breathing.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday. 
[02:09:30]  Are you breathing?  We're breathing.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Sitting in today, Jimmy Schubert.  All right.  Hey, I'm back.  What's up, man?  Nothing much.  ONA, Masters of the Universe.  Last time we saw you, you were wasted.  Last time you saw me, I was this high.  Yeah.  Visual, sorry.  Visuals always work on the radio.  Yeah, I know.  It's all right.  He was at one of our Philly broadcasts. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You guys naked girls all over the place.  Naughty 19 contest.  Booze and naked women, two of my favorite things.  Yeah.  The Naughty 90 contest, another excuse to get our female listeners naked.  Yeah, that's amazing.  I hear you guys got this.  You guys got a tough gig here, deciding to whip it out Wednesday.  It's very tough.  It's very difficult to make the cut.  So many teats, so little time.  Yeah.  It's kind of difficult.  You know, you go through, you're thinking, all right, I don't think this girl's going to  make it to the end, so we better cut her now. 
[02:10:30]  And then we get complaints from people.  Because we want to make the voting easy.  See, here's my philosophy, you know, I mean, you could get two big breasts.  Yeah.  But why not get, like, six medium-sized ones lined up down your upper torso like teats  on a peak.  Like you're suckling.  Like an animal.  Like they can just lean over.  And put one in the middle of your back for slow dancing.  I mean, what's better?  I mean, it's much better than two big ones.  That would probably win.  And she got seven.  One in the middle of the back.  Come on.  That would probably win.  Do you need a beer?  You know, I think I need a beer to take care of. 
[02:11:00]  I had a double cappuccino.  Let me do it.  I just had a crack of Sam.  Did you have to, huh?  Well, talking about Dave Dickless.  Oh, I know.  You went off.  Somebody needs a hug.  He trained me to drink is what it was.  He drove me to it.  Wow.  All right.  I was doing that beforehand.  Yeah, that's true.  Okay, I forgot.  You were drinking like Jack Daniels needed his bottles back.  Who are you kidding?  You had talent.  Anthony, you had talent and alcoholism before Dave Dickless.  Right.  Exactly.  There was one other thing that we touched on during commercials. 
[02:11:30]  And then we'll move on.  Hopefully.  This idiot.  Yeah.  This idiot Dave Douglas.  Here's what he did once.  Here's part of the training that helped our show.  If you listen to this program, tell me how this helped us.  He sits us in his office.  He's got a yellow legal pad.  And I'm like, uh-oh.  What is this?  I haven't been in radio that long, you know, so I'm sitting there and I'm...  Now, if someone did, I would just laugh in their face.  Just kick them in the nuts. 
[02:12:00]  Not behind their back when they left the room like everyone did to you, Dave.  Everyone laughed at you.  So all you're saying, this guy's only talent was that he had a set of shoes with coattail  hooks on the front of him and he stood behind guys like you and drug them to the top.  And slid around like everyone.  That's right.  Not just us.  I would never say like, oh my God, we were the end-all, be-all, do-all over there.  There were plenty of other people, support staff and whatnot that did hard work.  Otto, John O'Brien.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, he's one of those guys who just, you know, you've got a dream, you've got a vision. 
[02:12:30]  And he's one of those idiots you have to run through with your idea.  You know what I just say?  Yeah.  Like, he's the guy that's going to determine what we should then put out on the air.  Yeah.  He's never done it, but he could tell you how to do it.  He knows funny.  He should work for the networks.  Oh, great.  Because they're putting out some great funny programs these days.  But, you know.  But listen to this.  So we sit there and he goes, okay, who would you say your listeners are? 
[02:13:00]  Well, pick one listener.  Describe him to me.  Who is he?  Who is he?  Uh, and I'm sitting there looking at Opie like, what, what?  And I'm looking at Opie for a sign like, have you been through this before?  Do they do this?  I've been through a lot.  I've never been through that one.  I've been through the course where they teach you to look at a picture when you're on the air and talk to the picture.  You know, because that's your audience.  Take a picture of who you think your audience is and put it in front of you when you broadcast.  That way you get more of a feel of who you're talking to. 
[02:13:30]  So I used to bring in the Playboy center balls and hang them up.  Playboy.  Take a swank.  The nastiest pus-infested clam.  And that's what I want to see and talk to.  Right.  That's my audience.  All right, so go ahead.  I remember we answered the first question.  We went, uh, a guy.  A guy.  Oh, oh, oh, good.  Okay, so he writes down, he writes down with his little pen, a man.  Good, good. 
[02:14:00]  Okay, all right, we're on to something here.  How old would you say he is?  Now, I start perking up.  I'm like, all right.  Like Regan says, I see where you're going with this.  So I'm like, all right.  I'm going to describe.  At this point, we have been to plenty of appearances.  We've seen.  We've met.  We've smelt our audience.  Yeah.  I knew what they were when we were working there at AAF.  They were alcoholics.  Alcoholic, very young men that were into partying.  They had crap cars that were at least 15 years old, if they had one at all. 
[02:14:30]  Probably five dewees.  And they were messes.  And if they were married, they were cheating.  Right.  Right.  And they were, that was the audience.  We saw them.  We hung out with them.  We knew who they were.  That isn't what Dave wanted to hear.  I said, he goes, how old would you say they are?  I go, pfft, 20?  No, no, no, no.  It's like, you're asking me, douchebag.  You could have done this yourself.  We could have been doing something else. 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no.  So I go, uh, 22?  No, no, no, no, no.  He's like a bad police sketch artist.  He can only draw one face.  One face.  So he had a big nose, right?  No, no, no, no.  Because they all wind up looking like the same guy.  I can only draw the small nose.  He's the bad police sketch artist.  What'd you ask me for?  You know what'd you ask me for?  So I think we settled on something like, uh.  He wanted it way up.  27?  I go, where is this going?  Like, to sales? 
[02:15:30]  So, uh, he goes, okay, good, good.  27?  27-year-old guy.  All right, so far he's a man and he's 27 years old.  What does he drive?  He goes, what does he drive?  A beat-up pickup truck?  It's like, yeah, a pickup or something.  No, no, no.  No, no.  This is the crap you have to deal with when you get into radio.  This is the easiest job.  I'm embarrassed to call it a job, but it's the easiest job in America besides you comedians.  And, uh.  Yeah, hey.  And they wreck it with these exercises. 
[02:16:00]  No, no.  I'm like, okay, after three no's, I'm like, give me an F and I'll leave.  Because I know I'm not doing well on this little quiz that Dave Dickless is giving us.  No, he drives a brand new car.  It's a car, you know, maybe a Honda Civic.  You know, a Civic, something like that.  And he keeps going.  A car that gets good gas mileage.  So, what does he do for a living?  And now I'm right out of the gate.  I'm like, tin knocker.  He's a friggin' construction worker.  No, no.  You know, we have a lot of professional people that listen to this radio station. 
[02:16:30]  He's like, what?  No, I've been to the appearances.  He says, these guys are living hand-to-mouth.  Their entire paycheck is in their pocket.  They're not professional people.  He was trying to build up this illusion of what the audience was that was listening to that station.  Because he was trying to get us to go a little more highbrow.  Right.  Bingo.  And this was his trying to train us.  And if we saw that our audience wasn't this young low-life dirtbag, we would then change our show. 
[02:17:00]  We know low-life dirtbag.  We love low-life dirtbags.  Don't change us.  We know the lifestyle.  He wanted us to then start doing our show.  And if we listened to him, we certainly wouldn't be syndicated in 20 cities right now.  No.  Doing highbrow humor.  Highbrow.  The highbrow humor.  So, he wanted to try to make us understand.  What kind of...  What does he do when he's done working?  Yeah, what are his hobbies?  What kind of hobbies?  Jacking it.  He jacks it.  He pumps a lot of jack into a blanket of love.  He fires a load of baby batter into the pillowcase. 
[02:17:30]  He can't even get chicks.  It's crusting on his stomach, you idiot.  He squeezes one out of the flesh muscle.  No, no, no.  What?  Wrong.  There was the one.  There was the one.  There was the one.  You got just that too much descriptive, didn't you?  Oh, didn't I?  It's all right.  Come over the edge.  They dump it down the hole.  And that was so good.  Yeah, but they dumped out the stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  That's all right.  You live and learn.  Wait, so he put potato flakes in his...  What do you call him? 
[02:18:00]  You know, let me get my legal pad.  No!  Schubert, don't say anything.  Well, let me get my legal pad out.  Who do you think the dump guy is down the hall?  The guy with that nub?  The guy with his fingers worn down to a nub?  He's got a bandage on his dump finger?  He's a priest.  The guy down the hall.  Yeah, we got...  As long as we keep it a little vague.  Right, I got you.  So then he wanted us to talk to this guy, this 27-year-old guy that has a brand new car,  but a crappy new car. 
[02:18:30]  He was like an FBI profiler.  With an average white-collar job that sees two or three concerts a year.  Oh, he was a car salesman, too.  That was the guy he picked.  Really?  That was his job.  Maybe he works at a car dealership.  The funny thing is, you guys went out to find that guy, and he didn't exist.  He wasn't there.  He wasn't there.  You know something?  He was never at an appearance we were at.  Hey, dude!  I got a new car!  I work at the car dealership!  I'm married with two kids!  I make $55,000 a year! 
[02:19:00]  And I want to shove this beer bottle where that girl's pants cover!  All right?  All right?  That doesn't seem like the kind of guy that Dave Dickless spoke of.  Our listeners up there were lunatics.  Yeah.  They were always hammered.  And we loved them.  They were...  Yeah.  It was a great time, but this guy was delusional when it came to that stuff.  That was one of his big...  I guess that was training us, though.  That was training us, as he said in that article. 
[02:19:30]  We were trained by him.  The fact is, he hates this type of radio.  So how the hell did he ever help us to get to where we are today?  Who's your...  Our careers hook off after we got fired from it.  Thank God we got fired, and thank God he got fired.  You nothing.  All right.  You're going to just sit there with his picture in front of you?  Is that who you're talking to today?  I'm going to talk to Dave.  You're talking to Dave.  Hi, Dave.  How are you?  I'm doing fine.  There's a picture of Dave in front of you. 
[02:20:00]  I'm now a millionaire.  Hi, Dave.  Oh, God.  You're unemployed.  Unemployed.  I now have two places of residence.  You're unemployed.  You soon will have none.  How does that make you feel?  Jackass.  Does it make you feel sad?  Does it make you feel down?  Good.  Guy looks a little like Danny Terrio.  Is that my hair?  Oh, he's got the big 70s porno mustache.  He's got a snap on hair, Dickie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Hi, Dave. 
[02:20:30]  We're now hurt in 20 cities.  Yeah.  You're not even hurt where you used to work.  Jackass.  Fired.  You're fired.  You're not even being hurt by your wife anymore, are you?  Oh, I'm sure he's being hurt by her.  Did you look for a job yet?  Have you gotten a job?  Snookums, I'm working on it.  Well, Poopsie, I'm sure working at it.  I just got an exclusive interview with this proactive magazine.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  All I had to do was wrap my face around the junk and...  I've got an idea.  I'm going to tell them that I helped Opie and Anthony to get where they are today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As we stepped on him.  I think someone out there will buy it, Snookums.  Every article.  Every time he opens his yap, he's got to talk about how he...  You're fired.  There you go.  How he made us the show we are today.  When we finally realized we would just not listen to you, if you want to take that as a credit, 
[02:21:30]  well, I baited them into not listening to me.  And when they stopped listening to me, they shot to the top.  All right.  I guess I got to give them that.  But you better not print that.  Jackass.  Jimmy Schubert in the house, playing Rascals in West Orange all weekend long, right?  Yeah, actually...  And then Chicago next week.  We're on it.  Chicago next week, yeah.  And Vernon Hills, actually, going out there to have some fun at the club.  Schubert.  Hilarious.  Schubert.  He started off with, like, Kinison.  Yeah, actually, got my start there. 
[02:22:00]  We met each other years ago.  At the...  At our...  We used to have really long hair.  Yeah, dude.  I was doing a whole poser thing.  The whole Outlaws of Comedy.  Yeah, the Outlaws of Comedy.  Is that it?  Schubert wears one of them.  I see tapes, and I just kind of cringe, just like gay porno.  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  I got a mullet.  I got a monster mullet.  I look like Daryl Hall.  You know, I was like, oh, God, how could you have that?  I remember, though, I was in Rochester working at CMF, and Sam sold out, like, the big place  up there.  I forgot the name off.  The War Memorial.  Yeah.  Like, 12,000, 15,000 seats. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  And you got to do some time, and you killed.  Yeah.  It was like...  That's what I think about Kinison.  He was, like, bringing the band afterwards.  Band, you know, pile out to the bus.  You know, I'm just telling jokes, but this is cool.  You know, he's like a total poser.  That was the first time that he took a number from the audience that I saw, and called that  person, you know, at home and just trashed him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great stuff.  You've come a long way.  Unfortunately, he's dead, and Dave Dickless lives.  Yeah.  Where's the justice?  There is none. 
[02:23:00]  Where's the justice?  Aside from the fact that he's fired.  Fired.  Hold on.  There's someone that wants in here.  Oopsie.  I'm working on it.  Hey, Chris.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I think I'm a demographic mulatto.  Why?  I'm a professional, well-paid, 39-year-old scumbag driving a 12-year-old car.  Okay.  Let me write that down.  In fact, he fits the profile of every serial killer ever to come down the pike.  Yeah.  You still live with your mom, too, right?  I just want to let you know you had a broader appeal than perhaps you or Dickless were aware. 
[02:23:30]  Well, thank you.  Absolutely.  Love you, guys.  Are you friends with a lot of cops, sir?  Serial killers?  That's all right.  They always hang out with cops.  Do they?  Yeah.  Or they go to cop bars.  It's the same thing.  I don't even know why they have to hire new profilers.  It's the same guy.  Guy, yeah.  Every time.  All right.  They write it down.  All right.  We know it's the white guy.  He's that loner.  He's in that age bracket.  And he may look harmless like a grandpa or a dad.  He was my neighbor.  And you know something? 
[02:24:00]  I never even knew.  It was kind of quiet.  And that smell was coming from the basement.  And we went in.  We went in.  And we saw a bowl full of leather Cheerios.  He had cut out of his victims.  He had a collection of dirt buttons.  And that's where I knew it was something.  I mean, you had a whole heaping bowl full of them.  Hey, here's a goo.  What is this?  Try an apricot?  No, it's tan sphincter.  Enjoy yourself.  He takes all the time to stick a little pimento in each one. 
[02:24:30]  Wouldn't that just be great to see as you walk in as a cop or something?  Get a good one.  Mmm, tasty.  Oh, it's a sphincter.  Oh, it's a dried out scrotum full of candy.  Yum.  Let me have one of those.  What are those, lemon?  Yummy.  What do you got there in the camera bag?  A human hat?  Nice.  Same guy.  Ed Gein.  Ed Gein.  That was great.  Did you see the movie they made at that?  Yeah.  He wore the, he was the original guy that was sewing women's skin together. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, he was the dude.  To make himself the chick suit.  What a clown.  And then he'd go out in his front yard wearing this thing, this Franken-bitch outfit, and  just walk around.  That's what he said.  He saw a young couple, and he was walking up the thing, and he had the human head in  the bag, and he says, and he says, and I realized that's where I almost lost it.  It was a script for reality.  He's got his mom's severed head in the camera bag, and that's where I realized I almost lost  it.  Almost went over the edge.  Almost went over the edge there.  Thank God you held it together there, Ed. 
[02:25:30]  We were yapping about serial killers a few weeks ago.  Jim knows a lot about them.  He's like one of those frightening kind of, knows a little too much about all their stories.  Well, you have.  Because most people go, yeah, there was a guy, and he used to cut out spleens and eat  him, and bam, he knows the name, the address, the history, the lawyers in the case, everything.  It makes for some interesting reading, you've got to admit.  It is a lot of fun.  Not to mention, I mean, as a comedian, you're probably pretty screwed up anyway, so you read  about a guy who's really screwed up, and you're like, I don't feel so bad now. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  You start reading about their early history, and you're like, oh my God, I lived through  this same thing, and when am I going to turn?  Okay, that's where I made the turn, right there.  Yeah.  I mean, this guy was sticking away.  I got involved in sports.  Right, right.  But I could have gone down that road.  There's that little fork in the road that you take, and the other guy might take the  other one, but you realize it's going to be one of those things maybe in the future  where you just, all of a sudden, you're hanging out with your buds.  The next thing you know, you open your eyes, and you're covered in blood and wearing women's 
[02:26:30]  breasts.  There's a Girl Scout uniform all the front lawn.  There's cookies everywhere.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What happened?  It all go wrong.  I blacked out for a second or two.  Did you hear that story?  It was on the Judge Report, but a guy got locked up, this gay guy.  He was having sex with two dogs dressed in women's clothing.  Yeah, he was dressed in the brown pants.  And then, and then he murdered the dog.  He so does.  Now, let me ask you a question.  How afraid of rejection could you be? 
[02:27:00]  What's that like?  Hey, my boy.  Hey, my boy.  Hey, my boy.  Told you he'd like it.  Hold his tail, skater.  You know what I mean?  I mean, it's just wrong.  That's man's best friend.  That is no way to treat a best friend.  You don't ask him.  No.  And then he killed him.  Yeah, he hung one from the rafters.  Yeah.  And it was still wearing the bra and panties that he had to wear during the act.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not talking about putting a little peanut butter on your schwans to let your dog lick it off. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, hell, we've all done that.  Can't really judge a guy for that.  But, uh...  Were you ever afraid of the nip?  Maybe he'd nip.  That's why you've got to go in through the back, although you pull out your helmet and there's a pinworm on it.  You are horrid.  No, I was telling my dog Skippy today, I said that.  No.  All right.  You just know, you've got to feel guilty afterwards.  You know, if you're all caught up in the moment and...  And then at the second you...  When the moment's done and you're done and everything, you've just got to look at your dog dragging himself across the carpet like he's got... 
[02:28:00]  You ever see those dogs who bark a lot, like...  Like they're crazy.  It's like they're trying to communicate with you.  He's putting it in my...  He has a little doggy archwitch in his back.  He's trying to communicate with you.  I'm being raped.  He's trying to...  You know, if you can read about it.  It's got to be humiliating as a man as you're raping a dog, that look over the shoulder.  He's got to give you that look. 
[02:28:30]  Like, what the...  What's the matter with you?  Does he do that turn look and then the...  I mean, the dog's looking at you like...  I can't even lick myself anymore after this.  I feel so dirty.  You know, the dog's on Sally, Jesse, Raphael.  He's got some sunglasses on so the other dogs don't recognize him.  After it first happened, I couldn't even drink out of the toilet anymore.  I don't think...  The dog is losing on a...  We should break, Anthony.  The neighbor and his dog catch frisbees.  I got to get this.  Jimmy Schubert's hanging out with us today. 
[02:29:00]  He's playing Rascals in West Orange all weekend long, right, Jimmy?  Yes, absolutely.  I'm working with my buddy Richard Gerken out there.  Very funny stuff.  And Chicago next week.  Chicago next week.  Vernon Hills.  Yeah, absolutely.  We'll continue.  We got to talk about this WOW contest with Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  We're hoping some more of the ladies that we kicked out call us up.  Yeah.  Because we got an offer that we've been making to these ladies, right?  See, we're very flexible.  If you call up and you've been thrown out of the contest, you can plead your case.  If you find a girl that you think is worse off than you are, we'll take a look. 
[02:29:30]  We'll be honest and maybe do the old switcheroo and get you back in.  We've done it once so far today.  In the meantime, a little song about a serial killer.  I made quite a splash.  I hacked and I slashed.  My way to the top of page one.  The cops even checked, but they didn't suspect. 
[02:30:00]  I was carving up fellers for fun.  Guess I never thought I'd finally get caught.  I hope that they all rest in peace.  Cause I'm locked away.  What more can I say?  Except what I told the police.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I got arms and legs and a few faces stashed all around in different parts of town. 
[02:30:30]  Well, I met them in bars on a friendly basis.  Now I got them in jars and flower bases.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  I know I was wrong.  I just don't belong.  I guess you've heard that one before. 
[02:31:00]  I guess you've heard that one before.  But the guys, they all dig me.  I'm like Eleanor Rigby.  There's a face in a jar by my door.  I must be insane.  Got an abnormal brain.  What else could I do to get laid?  The guys that I date met a terrible fate. 
[02:31:30]  They ended up lightly sauteed.  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces.  Every shape and size and all races.  All blood and goods.  Man, I must be nuts.  Well, I got one that'll really kill you.  I'm the poster child for necrophilia.

[02:43:30]  We're back with The Opium Anthony Show.  Wheelchair Fred was on hold, Anthony.  He's got problems with the show.  What now?  I don't know.  I don't know where he went.  Maybe he'll call back.  I am so glad.  He wants money.  He doesn't want us to call him gay anymore.  He's not gay.  He's desperate.  That's right.  That's what he says.  He can't feel anything from his waist down.  So if you flip him over and hit him in the turd cutter, he can't feel it anyway.  I mean, you stretch him out like an old raincoat. 
[02:44:00]  It doesn't mean anything.  He's fine with it.  He should be a little more giving like that.  By the way, the guy with the awful voice is Jimmy Schubert.  The guy who sounds like he gargles with gravel.  That would be Schubert.  He's playing Rascals in West Orange all weekend long.  Very funny guy.  And then he's going to be in Chicago next week.  Here's wheelchair Fred, Jimmy.  Listen to this voice.  Freddie.  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  I'm a very good one.  Hey, Norton. 
[02:44:30]  Norton, he's saying hey.  Hey, Norton.  Hello, Fred.  I don't know.  This is Jake.  Come on down.  What?  All right.  I didn't catch that one.  Fred.  Come on down.  Right.  Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah, what?  You have a problem with people saying that you go with guys?  No.  Can you tell Schubert this story?  I just love this story. 
[02:45:00]  What?  You don't want to tell me?  No, no.  Here, I'll just run through it quickly.  Yeah.  If Fred tells it, I'm going to need a wake-up call.  Go ahead.  Let's cut to the chase.  Well, I can help.  The guy, oh, yeah, it is a long story.  Now that I think about it.  He had a motorcycle accident.  Right.  He ended up in a wheelchair, not because he's paralyzed, but the doctors really effed his  legs up, so his legs aren't functional.  He can still feel his legs.  His spine is a little screwy, too.  Yeah, a little bit, but not that bad.  And his voice box obviously crushed.  His voice box was crushed, so he can't talk. 
[02:45:30]  He's still there.  But his mind is fine.  He just cannot communicate with people.  What kind of a hell is that to open?  Yeah, that is a help, you know.  So, he has trouble getting girls now because he's in the wheelchair.  He talks like that.  Everyone thinks he's retarded.  So, he went so long without getting laid, he opened up his options a little bit and said,  all right, if guys want to have sex with me, that's fine.  Well, see, that's the thing.  See, guys will have sex with anything.  I've been with some guys in the condo. 
[02:46:00]  They'll hump a sofa down the hallway at 3 o'clock in the room.  Right.  They're all gacked out and drunk.  So, he opened up his options.  But he says...  He picks up a guy.  He says he's not gay.  He does.  He wants everyone to know, I'm not gay.  I'm just desperate.  So, he picked up a guy.  A young fella.  Actually, the guy picked him up.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess that has to happen.  Yeah.  He picked up a young fella.  A young fella of 18.  18 or 19.  Yeah.  A nice, virile young buck.  Irish boy, I remember.  Oh, yes.  An Irish boy.  And the kid flipped him over and hit him right in a spider bite. 
[02:46:30]  What?  What?  No.  What?  He got him, I guess, leaning against his bed post.  Well, the pickup was the best because he wheeled past the deli and the kids were hanging out.  And Fred comes wheeling up.  Oh, because it was an ad in a magazine.  Right.  Let's meet at the deli.  It was like, okay, so they hooked up and they said they were going to meet at the deli.  So, Fred's wheeled up to the deli and the young buck comes walking by and there's no 
[02:47:00]  mistaking Fred.  In his tight jeans.  In his tight pants.  With his banana poking through.  Did they go to your place, Fred?  Yeah, of course.  I'm right here.  Right.  They went to his place.  I don't know what the hell he said.  Okay.  And then he bent him over.  He bent Fred over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And had his way with Fred.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Fred said, and Fred, a direct quote goes, ah, what the hell? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, he goes, well, you know, ah, what the hell?  So, he proceeded to return the favor to the guy.  To return the favor to the guy, I guess, with your face?  No, he, you went.  No, I've never liked the booty.  Hit him in the booty.  In the booty.  In the booty.  Did he sit on your lap in the wheelchair?  He held on to the bedpost, remember?  Oh, so that was when the kid was getting it? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, he's standing over the bedpost and Fred, no, apparently, Fred, he gutted the guy like  a pumpkin.  He had little specks of corn and stuff.  He had to knock out of his Johnson stuff.  I still got the kid.  So, he was all shaky.  He was all shaky holding on with one arm with the bedpost.  He's kind of shaking with all the strength he has in his upper body to hold himself up.  Yeah.  He was getting the job done.  As he was, yeah, laying some pipe, as they say.  But now Fred doesn't like us exploiting that on the show, I guess. 
[02:48:30]  You don't want people to think you're gay.  Right, Fred?  No.  The problem was some of them didn't grab young boys.  Hey, you sound like a Catholic priest.  What did you go to?  Our Lady at a Glory Hole?  What's this guy's story?  I heard little boys is all I heard.  Yeah.  Yeah, Fred.  He said three Hail Marys and an R-5.  Yeah, George, he said he.  You're a dirty, filthy little raisin hole.  Bring it over here and let Father wash it off with the bar of soap.  Let me go over here and touch it. 
[02:49:00]  You've been a sinner.  You're a dirty little sinner.  You want some body of Christ in him?  Get over here and step in the confessional.  You've been a bad little boy.  Get over here and say your forgiveness.  That's right.  Say it, sonny.  Say it.  Welcome to Our Lady of the Glory Hole.  Freddy.  Yeah.  One more time.  What did you say?  Your intern said I like boys.  Your, where, where, where, what?  Your intern. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, our intern.  He likes the intern little boys.  I like little boys.  Said you like little boys.  Wait, Stinky's coming in here.  I have a friend.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Something's going on here because Stinky just walked in with the biggest smile and he's not  even high.  What is going on with the real tear, Fred?  During the break, Ben picked him up to tell him we had to leave, but he asked him a few  questions beforehand.  Ah.  And what was...  Ben was his name.  And what was one of the questions, Fred? 
[02:50:00]  You're my good boy.  And what did you say?  No way, Ben.  And I take offense to that.  My son, I couldn't take it.  He bent over for an 18-year-old drunken Irish kid, yet he takes offense to what Ben said.  Yeah, well, this guy ought to be careful because people are just going to start throwing  him out of the wheelchair and hitting him right in the raisin hole because who the hell  is he going to tell?  Who's going to find out about it?  I was ready.  There were 20 of them. 
[02:50:30]  There were 20 of them.  They put it right in my corn chute.  Yeah, well, you do what you have to do.  You do what you have to do.  Okay.  That's my life.  Fred, you aren't giving oral treats right now, are you?  No, I'm not.  You're actually doing a movie about this guy, my left anus.  My left anus.  That's right. 
[02:51:00]  So, Fred, I guess, have you got any girls, though, lately?  That's my life.  What?  That's since the last century.  That's since the last century.  This ought to be a game show.  Figure out what he's trying to say.  What's he saying?  Who can complete the sentence?  We used to play, you know, what is Fred saying?  We might have to bring that back.  Yeah.  Because I'm finding him very hard to understand today.  How would you be?  I have a call or something. 
[02:51:30]  All right, so what's your problems with the show, Fred?  You don't want to say that you're gay anymore, right?  There's no problem with that, but I don't want you to say that I like boys.  All right, we won't say...  Little boys.  Well, 18 is your limit, right?  Yeah.  Fred, how old are you?  I'm 38.  All right, 38.  So if you had sex with an 18-year-old kid, that's a little boy as far as looking at it.  You're right.  Okay.  You're right.  So I think Ben is quite accurate by asking you. 
[02:52:00]  I was 36 at the time.  You were 36 at the time.  Okay.  When was the last time he had a guy?  I don't know what the guy was like.  Kyle, we have to have him sing some Louis Armstrong.  I didn't have to go.  What was that one song?  What was that one song?  That's a beautiful one.  What a beautiful one.  What a beautiful one.  This guy and Ozzy Osbourne should play Password. 
[02:52:30]  That is funny.  I'd like to buy a vowel.  You got to sing some Louis Armstrong, Fred.  Do you know any Louis Armstrong?  Do you know any Louis Armstrong?  Get some oxygen.  That's Jimmy Durante.  Yeah, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  Wow, you knew what he was saying.  That's right.  I used to listen to Jimmy Durante. 
[02:53:00]  I read the book of the week.  I read the book of the day.  I read the book of the hour.  I read the book of the hour.  Cha-cha-cha-cha.  Good night, Miss Kai.  Wherever you are.  Yeah.  Freddie.  Yeah.  You've got to sing some Louis Armstrong for us today.  I don't think he knows.  You'd have to think?  Yeah, I don't think he knows.  I don't think he knows who he knows.  Do we have What a Wonderful World anywhere?  You know what that is?  Ghost soundtrack. 
[02:53:30]  I don't know what it is.  If you want to, I'll pick it up.  It was on the Good Morning Vietnam soundtrack.  Oh, we got that one, I think.  Do we?  I think we have that one.  Yeah.  Earl would know if he was here.  All right, Freddie, so we'll stay away from the gay thing, even though we still want to  play your clip.  I'm not gay.  I'm desperate.  That's cool.  That's what he says.  That's true.  All right.  I'd call him a CS-er, but I know he's trying to quit.  And also, I'm hearing you want us to send you money, right? 
[02:54:00]  That'll be nice.  But do you want us to go down to the brewery?  Do I?  Oh, down to the brewery after we do Sex for Sam, when we go to the Sam Adams brewery?  You won't be too annoying.  You won't go to try to sit on any bottles, will you?  No.  No.  Hey, who are you kidding?  This guy could do deep knee bends over a fire hydrant.  He can't feel it anyway.  The thing that I can't feel, I have full sensation down there. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Full sensation down there.  Yeah.  This guy's leather Cheerio and his baseball hat are the same size.  Oh, I don't know what that was.  Hey, Freddie.  You know what's a shame?  Hopefully, the dumb guy doesn't speak retard.  He's like, oh, I'm not retarded.  I just showed something very thirsty.  I can't read your email, please.  What?  He reads your email.  I look too.  I try to read your email, but it seems like you're writing your email with the palms of your hand. 
[02:55:00]  He actually, he talks the same way he types.  I-R-E-R.  I want to thank you all before my name.  What?  You made the name Wheelchair Fred.  He's thanking you for calling him Wheelchair Fred.  Right.  Yeah, I named you many years ago, Fred.  Yeah, but he-  Thank God he wasn't a black guy named Norman. 
[02:55:30]  All right, Fred.  I don't know what to do with you.  A lot of people are suggesting we get you a hooker.  We can do that.  Oh, thank you.  I said we'd get a hermaphrodite.  Let's go to the extra nine yards, just in case.  Can we sneak a hooker into the St. Adam's Brewery?  Sure.  Now, after you just said it?  No, hypothetically.  If we ever really wanted to.  Hey, Freddy, we're going to get a young stud for you.  Maybe I'd rather have a couple. 
[02:56:00]  Would you rather have a guy or a girl?  Both at one time, he said.  Don't be greedy.  Mike has a great idea on line 11.  Mike, go ahead.  Yeah, I think for Sex for Sam 3, you should give a sign of 20-point value to have sex right on Fred's lap.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Make it like 50.  Make it worth something.  Yeah, we're going to do Sex for Sam.  It's Sex for Sam 3, right? 
[02:56:30]  We're up to the third one?  Yes.  We should have Fred just kind of hanging around the area.  And if you do something with Fred, you get 50 bonus points.  Go up and Fred, and the guys can pick up 20 for that.  Right.  But the girls get 50 if they just...  Also, I'm jealous.  I would love to put your party.  All right.  Well, you're going to be at our party when we're at the Sam Adams Brewery.  Chris, what's going on?  Oh, we lost Chris.  Chris said the spirit...  I'm still here.  No, we know you're still there.  Oh, you're still there, please.  Where are you going to go? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, she used that easily.  We know you're still there.  It's going to take you at least five minutes just to hang the phone.  And also, I follow an Opie and Anthony wheelchair friend.  Oh, are you the third member of the Opie and Anthony show now?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wheelchair Douglas?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, boy.  I thought I...  All right, Fred.  I think we're going to let you go.  Yeah.  I'm not sending you money.  But you can party with us when we're up in Boston. 
[02:57:30]  Freddy, it's not a big time.  Yeah, don't go accidentally wheeling yourself into some guy's mule.  That's the perfect height for that.  I know.  Oh, oh.  I got a mule in my mouth.  But this way, if you had to send me some gas to get there.  I'm not getting there.  I'm just bad with direction.  If you don't send me some cash to get there.  Oh, now we got to give him cash to get to the brewery? 
[02:58:00]  All the sudden, start rolling now.  You'll be there by the time we get there.  That was another class move that Dave Dickless used to do with Wheelchair Fred after we left.  They used Wheelchair Fred at our old station.  Yeah.  And they would pretty much exploit him like we do.  Oh, that's how bad this guy is.  At least we would get the guy rides home and throw him in a cab and stuff.  He would go to station events and beg for money because he didn't have any money to get home.  And I swear to you, and this was reported in all the papers up there, the local papers, 
[02:58:30]  Wheelchair Fred had a wheelchair himself home one night on the side of a highway.  He was going down like Route 9.  There you go.  That's how Dave Dickless takes care of his people.  Another fine example.  Not to mention, he actually eventually wound up giving Wheelchair Fred his own show.  Welcome to the show.  I was like...  I would listen to that, though.  I would listen to that.  I'm sure.  But I...  Yeah, middays, and then they doubled, yo. 
[02:59:00]  I used to go, yo.  Hey, Fred, just sing this one verse.  What a beautiful world.  I would be in the world.  Can you sing, hello, Dolly?  Hello, Dolly.  I said hello.  Dolly, it's so hard to see you here today.  Nice to see you here today.  And sleep. 
[02:59:30]  And sleep.  When you woke up, you won't remember any of it.  And wheelchair friends sleep.  All right, Fred.  I saw you, it's like Ozzy.  What?  What?  I sound like Ozzy.  You sound like Ozzy.  You make Ozzy...  Look good.  Not for nothing.  I make Ozzy sound good, you're right.  All right, Fred, give your plug.  Where are you going to be appearing tonight?  At the local Applebee's again?  He's going down to the Mother Road.  It's sleep night.  No, this guy appears. 
[03:00:00]  You're going to be at the chicken bone?  No, I'm going nowhere tonight.  You're not going anywhere?  Why?  Because I don't have to go.  I don't want it to go.  Why don't you go to the chicken bone?  How about you just go to the...  Oh, he's a little leery about going out of the house by himself.  I'm going to take you down to myself.  What?  Oh, I heard that one.  I heard that one.  Oh, is that what he's going to do? 
[03:00:30]  That's too much information, Fred.  I don't know if he made the radio, but Fred has a big thing that ladies usually have, and  he'll take care of himself, he said.  What did he have?  Oh, does he?  He has like a...  You know what's so funny?  I was in the bar the other night, and a girl stood up at the end of the bar.  It was an angry lesbian.  And screamed at her,  I can do anything a man can do. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, well, tell the buyer a round of the drinks then, honey.  And a pair of...  I got Freddy.  I got Freddy.  Hey, Fred.  Do you name this device?  Does this device have a name?  It's Big Rubber Thick.  Is it the triple ripple vibrating...  Wait, hold on.  What did he say?  He said...  It's Big Rubber Thick.  Wait a minute, Fred.  Hold on a minute.  That's what I'm saying.  Fred, is this thing is just rubber? 
[03:01:30]  Does it have any electronics in it?  No, it's just rubber.  And you...  So, you take it and you put it somewhere, right?  Without...  Let's all be very vague here.  But you take it and you put it somewhere that...  Where it's going to come down.  What?  Wait, wait, hold on.  What did he say?  Where it comes down?  All right.  How old is he? 
[03:02:00]  Four?  That didn't make the radio.  All right.  All right, well, that's very funny, but that didn't make the radio.  We know where he puts it, so don't say it.  We know where you put it, man.  But you do that, and as you sit in the chair, or have you just installed it on the wheelchair?  Yeah.  Keeps him from falling off when he stops short.  He never falls out of the seat. 
[03:02:30]  He said in his bed and in his bathtub.  Oh, in the bathtub, I think.  Oh, in the bathtub, and you enjoy doing that to yourself, Fred?  Yeah, but I guess I just said, why are you guys...  I must confess, you like that, yeah?  Yeah, but I think if you want to go gay.  But you're not gay.  I don't want to leave the bush. 
[03:03:00]  He doesn't want to leave the bush.  Right.  He doesn't want to leave the bush.  I don't love the bush.  Yeah, but is this...  Well, George W. likes you, too.  Is this a device in the shape of a man's unit, though?  Yeah.  You're gay.  You're gay.  You're a faggot friend.  So it's a floppy, rubber man's mule.  Does it have yam bags attached to it?  Yeah.  You're so gay, bro.  I can pretty much...  I'll accept, because we had this discussion with couples, and guys will argue that it's, 
[03:03:30]  you know, they don't mind this act.  If a girl stimulates certain areas...  With something that doesn't look like a man's unit.  But he's taking this big, rubbery, floppy mess.  I mean, you know what?  I bet you for what it costs for that rubbery, floppy unit, you could probably pick up one  of those pocket pals.  Right.  Right.  Or the other side.  That's right.  To have those rubber dolls.  I got it for free.  A gay friend got it for me. 
[03:04:00]  A gay friend got it.  Oh, God.  Gave it to you for free.  Did you wash it, Fred?  Why am I losing weight?  This guy's like John Merrick if he was gay.  I am not an animal.  Well, sometimes I am.  I am not on a diet.  Why am I losing weight?  I am not an animal.  I'm getting skimier. 
[03:04:30]  My doctor says something about teeth.  I am not an animal.  Oh, man.  So you got it from a gay friend.  And you use it.  How often do you use this?  How often a week do you use it?  And why did the gay friend give it up?  He was done with this thing?  This guy goes through those apparatuses like athletes go through sneakers.  You know what I'm saying?  He's going to re-up every three months.  He wears the form off the head.  It becomes just very smooth. 
[03:05:00]  It's like a rubber stick with no helmet on it.  When it looks like the Washington Monument, it's time for a new one.  I think it's fresh out of the box.  Wow.  What, Fred?  It's fresh out of the box.  Oh, fresh out of the box.  Fresh out of the box.  Well, pencil in a joke there.  You want to be...  Yeah.  Okay.  Fred?  How often do you use it?  Fred, shut up.  You're scared of AIDS.  Well, sure. 
[03:05:30]  Get 18-year-old guys to bang you if you're scared of AIDS.  Fred, how often do you use this thing?  I'm talking like I'm talking about a guy.  Fred's out there shacking up with guys who suck C for drug money.  He's just come on here and, you know, he's afraid of AIDS.  I'll be at you in about once a week.  Once a week?  You use it about once a week?  One night.  Like Tuesday nights is the night.  He got it from a gay guy who only uses it on Sunday afternoons after church.  Hey, when you're done with it, do you clean it off 
[03:06:00]  or just hang it over the door to keep burglars away?  I clean it off with this point.  Oh, God.  That's awful.  I want to get some real action in this town.  You can't get any real action?  I can't find it.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  I think we've learned too much today. 
[03:06:30]  Big rubber mule that he's going to use tonight.  Once a week he uses it.  So, not tonight.  Maybe tomorrow.  Oh, why not tonight?  Because I have principles, don't you know?  What?  I have principles.  He has principles?  Yeah.  He only uses it on the Sabbath.  Right.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to be considered a slut.  Fred, how drunk do you have to be before you use that thing?  Yeah, really.  I hardly drink anymore. 
[03:07:00]  What?  He hardly drinks anymore.  Oh, really?  We're thinking...  I'm back on medication.  Yeah?  Suppositories?  They fall out like M&Ms out of a bag.  No.  A-Z-T.  I'm on the AIDS medicine.  It's a control of temper.  Control your temper?  Yeah.  How do you know I'm Ritalin?  You're angry?  You're on that...  I was a good... 
[03:07:30]  I ripped the radio out of the van.  I couldn't hear that either.  Yeah, I...  I don't know.  I ripped the radio out of the van.  You ripped the radio out of the van?  Oh.  Yeah.  You stick it in your balloon nut?  Why did you do that?  What were you mad at?  The driver wouldn't drop me.  It was like 95 degrees out.  Yeah.  It was 95 degrees out, so you decided you had to rip the radio out of the van?  I just gave him smoke. 
[03:08:00]  The driver wouldn't drop me off.  One block from my house.  So you ripped the radio out of his van?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  He's an angry, angry Fred.  A-N-G guy.  I bet you could open this guy's colon.  It would look like the contents of a shark's stomach, a spare tire, an old license plate.  License plate.  You know.  Kinder boy?  A couple class rings just falling out of there.  Like, you know, a human leg.  You know, just, oh, what's this guy been up to? 
[03:08:30]  Jeez.  One thing you want to realize is I'm very strong body-wise.  You're very what body-wise?  A strong upper body.  Yeah, he is.  A strong upper body.  This guy's an animal from, like, his nips up.  So he could work a mule like nobody's business.  He's got to reach around, though.  When you have the apparatus, you have to reach around and probably...  Yeah, Fred, how do you work that?  Do you use one hand for the rubber mule, and then the other hand you're taking care of yourself? 
[03:09:00]  No, I use one hand for the mule, and one hand to stabilize myself.  To part yourself.  Like the Red Sea.  To stabilize.  And your legs just lay there in the way?  No, I can't pull you to my legs.  He just, uh...  He has a pulley system set up in the bedroom.  He pulls his legs out.  No, I have.  He just spreads out the dirt. 
[03:09:30]  He spreads out his thing in a vat, a 55-gallon vat of KY jelly.  This guy slides it on in there.  And he's actually ruined the tightness on his raisin.  He has to have, like, a piece of elastic sewed back in there because he stretched it out.  And every time he...  Because he's lost the elasticity in it.  All right.  Is that what you're trying to say?  I would say 50% of that probably made it through.  Fred, did you have to have an O-ring put on your balloon nut? 
[03:10:00]  No.  Sorry.  He blew a seal.  Yeah.  That's what brought the challenger down.  A leaky O-ring.  So if he could do that to a spacecraft...  Yeah.  Imagine what he could do to...  He blew a seal.  No, I'm not kidding you.  All right.  Fred, we've got to let you go, all right?  All right.  Let you go.  Fred, we've got to cut you loose.  It's Steve on line four.  Who's the lifeguard with Fred Tate? 
[03:10:30]  I need action.  You need action.  You need action.  He sounds like Al Pacino.  Check me your eyes.  They pull you back.  I don't think you like it.  Hey, uh...  Rock!  I want to make you a little under.  And grab that in the lock.  It's Burgess Meredith, ladies and gentlemen.  Burgess Meredith.  Turn on the bridge.  Oh.  Look at you.  You're a mongrel, kid.  You're a mongrel.  What do you got there? 
[03:11:00]  Is that a roll?  Yeah, I get the red roll for three grand.  They get the appetizer.  What do you get out of it?  I get the 500.  Shrewd, kid.  Real shrewd.  Rock, spread me out.  Right.  I can take this rubber thing.  Put that boxing glove on and punch me right in my ring.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to make it.  I'm going to make it.  Twist me up and chase me around and ring like a chicken.  I'm going to make it good for that. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, we've got to get rid of it, Fred.  Hey, Fred.  I can take this.  Hey, Fred.  We've got a homework assignment for you.  Next time you call in, we want you to sing It's a Beautiful World or whatever that song is.  Wonderful World.  It's a Wonderful World.  It's a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, okay?  Well, let's find the lyrics.  You've got to find the lyrics.  You can find that online.  Does he have a computer?  Maybe get the song and you can play it and sing along to the record.  You can find it to me. 
[03:12:00]  All right, we'll find it and send it to you.  Deal.  Deal.  Done deal.  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  There he goes.  All right.  Thank you, Freddy.  God bless you, man.  Fred?  Fred?  Yeah, what?  Dude.  Dude, don't.  Come on.  Nothing.  Holy, I don't.  He got me.  Oh, no.  He got me.  Jimmy Schubert is in the house today.

My mother smokes crack rock.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay you down and give you a little buccacke?  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body.  Oh, it blow out.  Gay porn. 
[03:13:00]  Bow.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The floodier, the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And the EW.  I've got a discus in my ass cheeks.  Ron and Fez.  Weeknights at 7 after Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNAW.  You're offered instant stardom.  And more money than you've ever seen.  But does becoming the host of one of the most popular shows in history come with a curse? 
[03:13:30]  Mr. Coombs had hung himself in the closet in their psych ward.  Sunday at 8.  The disturbing E! True Hollywood story of Family Feud.  Survey says...  Out of control egos.  A history of self-abuse.  I used to gamble all the time.  And I was drinking.  And ultimate acts of desperation.  I think he just wanted all the hurt to go away.  What is it about this one show that brings to life every man's darkest fears? 
[03:14:00]  I've never had anyone tell you the truth about that, have you?  It's the story you haven't heard.  Louie Anderson doesn't give a damn about the people playing the game with him.  The all-new E! True Hollywood story of Family Feud.  This Sunday at 8 only on E!  Plus, Anna Nicole Smith has something to get off her chest.  The Anna Nicole Show premieres next Sunday at 10 on E!

[03:14:30]  But you know, summer's here.  That's right.  Anytime you think of a great summer party, what do you think about?  You're hanging out, backyard, nice deck.  They got the pool.  Chicks in the pool.  You got the barbecue going.  So the whole backyard smells like some kind of a barbecued beef chicken thing.  And that cooler.  The cooler by the house.  They keep it by the patio.  You crack that top open, what do you see?  Beer.  Bud Light.  Glistening.  The ice is like, it's all cold. 
[03:15:00]  You dig in there, you pull out that Bud Light.  And some ass brings a crappy brand to the party.  And they're getting in the way.  And you got to start digging and digging.  And like, oh, there's one.  They throw their crap beer in, and they're taking your Bud Light.  I used to hate that ice.  And then you look around, and you go, and then you see under the surface, you barely  see, it's like, oh, there's one Bud Light left.  And you grab that thing, and you're styling.  Meister, bro!  Oh, get away!  Where's the Bud Light?  Bud Light.  You party in the summer, do it with Bud Light.  Like most of us, your car is probably not new anymore.

[03:21:30]  Vernon Hills.  Zany's.  Zany's Comedy Club.  Zany's.  Zany's.  Yeah.  Zany's.  All right, Tommy has a problem on the line here.  Let's go to the middle class.  You know something, though?  Before you do this, I want to tell Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tony?  Yeah.  Don't say the number or the name or anything with this story because we're not sure if it's true.  So don't even say who this is.  Okay.  That you're calling about.  You're saying one of your, your girlfriend, is it?  Yes.  Is one of the girls in the contest.  Mm-hmm.  The wow contest.  Yeah.  And you're saying she's in jail? 
[03:22:00]  Yes, she is.  All right.  Don't say her number or name because we don't know who you are and I don't want her calling  saying I'm not in jail and now we're suing you for saying I was in jail.  Oh, right, right.  All right.  What happened?  I really can't say what she did because she still has a court date coming up.  But no one knows now.  Oh, see, that's the beauty of you not saying it so you can say anything.  Okay.  There's no connection, you see?  Yeah.  I'm sorry?  There's no connection so you can tell us.  Right.  Okay.  She got in trouble for embezzlement from her job. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And she's going to court.  Is she still in jail?  She's in jail right now.  What's her bail?  I have no idea.  Where's she work, Enron?  No.  Embezzlement.  How much did they say she took?  Only like 600 bucks.  Oh, that's not...  Well, that's laughable right now.  If you've got embezzled, go for the big nut.  She should just show those beautiful cans and get out of jail.  Those are get-out-of-jail-free cans.  I'll say.  Oh, yeah.  That's not embezzlement. 
[03:23:00]  That's just stealing.  Yeah, that's stealing.  Embezzlement's got to be, I don't know, thousands of dollars, right?  You've got to do something to embezzle.  That's pilfering.  Yeah.  So?  That's petty theft.  So what are you saying?  I am saying you guys wanted to...  Well, right.  I wanted to call and speak up for her in the contest, and she couldn't do it herself.  Well, you could even go as far as to say it's one of the girls that were kicked out.  Mm-hmm.  And you're trying to get her back in with this sob story?  Yeah.  Well, she's in county right now getting the roast beef curds working over by a large black 
[03:23:30]  woman named Steve.  So we wanted to speak up for her and let her know that, you know.  Why is she kicked out of the contest?  I don't know.  She's got a really nice...  I don't think she should be out.  I was waiting for her to call so she could make a switch with somebody maybe, but she's  in lockup.  Obviously can't call.  She's being shanked.  I say you put her back in.  Put her back in. 
[03:24:00]  She took it in the liver in the yard.  She'd call herself, but she's in the infirmary.  She got put in solitary.  The thought of her in lockup is so hot.  I know.  It really is.  You know those guards?  They got male guards there.  I like the smell of the end of one of those nightsticks.  Oh, yeah.  Smells like the door off an old tuna boat.  Right there in a huge schmoony.  Go, no, just throw a knuckle up in it.  Like the baton with the thing where you spin it right up into the handle. 
[03:24:30]  Smells like old food and shattered dreams.  So, Tony, is this really a girlfriend?  Yes, I swear.  100%.  I believe him.  How old is she?  She's 18.  How old are you?  26.  What kind of work was she doing?  She worked in a record store.  Dude, let me ask you something.  She's up for...  Yeah, embezzlement from a record store. 
[03:25:00]  She was stealing.  She's up for $600 worth of theft.  What's her bail?  She was out on like a...  The judge gave her a...  I think it was $1,000, but gave her personal recognizance.  Right.  And then when she went in to take her plea,  I don't know what that judge's problem was,  but he revoked her bond and had her locked up until sentencing.  But why not bail?  It's $600.  She's a flight risk.  I'm sorry?  She's a flight risk.  She's got a horrible lawyer. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, her lawyer is making her wait like three weeks.  Who's the lawyer?  Jacobian Meyer?  Who's she working with?  Who's defending her?  Colin Ferguson?  Moussaoui is acting as her lawyer, too.  Moussaoui.  He's guilty.  He's not guilty.  What is he?  He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.  Come on.  Let the guy put him in.  So how long has she been in?  She's been in about a week now.  You're telling me no bail.  They haven't said it,  and her lawyer is not doing anything about it for like three weeks.  That's not even... 
[03:26:00]  That's insane.  It's ridiculous, but that's what's going on.  Do you call a real lawyer for this girl?  Well, yes.  Come on.  And she got an idiot public defender anyway, so...  Oh, really?  And an idiot boyfriend.  Yeah, help her out.  Yeah, help her out with a lawyer.  Get down there to that court.  Look at those cans.  Get a couple of horses and a rope,  tie it to the bars,  and pull her out of there.  Something.  I would be helping my chick.  I would if I had money.  Drives up as a woman and throw a brick through a window.  You would if you had the money.  It's a thousand bucks.  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  I've got like no money.  He's got no bucks.  This guy's throwing money around a guy with no arms.  Apparently he still has milk money from second grade.  Otherwise, he'd help her out.  He's in a bad way.  You know what's going on in there?  18-year-old girl in lockup?  Yeah, she's so vulnerable.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, man.  How long have you been dating her?  About a year.  And someone was saying it's Petty Larson,  and it's not bad at all.  She must have did something else besides this.  Yeah, what else is on the record? 
[03:27:00]  Because they would let someone out on that.  Yeah, it's nothing.  No, James on line three is saying you're lying.  I've been arrested eight times.  No, because it's embezzlement.  Tell James to relax.  The record's 11.  It's a felony offense because what?  It's a felony offense if it's over $200.  I don't think that's right.  That's what they got her for.  Third strike.  She got a third strike working against her.  Yeah.  No, she has nothing else on her record.  But she's got great cans.  Yeah.  I got to say.  A perfectly clean record. 
[03:27:30]  She steals $600, and she's doing a month in jail?  She got picked up from carrying concealed silicone.  Dude, how much do you love us for the fact that even though she's locked up,  you could pop up our website and jack it to her?  Dude, I've got plenty of pictures of her besides the ones on the website.  You don't want to send them to tinkledrinker at AOL.com?  You certainly don't want to mail them to your old pal, Jimmy Norton,  who will bail her out if you do?  A lot of people are saying you're full of ass.  Yeah, a lot of people say you're lying, man.  You're not telling the full story.  Yep, I say. 
[03:28:00]  She either did something else.  There might be drugs involved.  Something else is going on.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  See, look at that.  How is she out of the contest?  She has to be back in.  I know.  We were hoping she'd call because this is a horrible injustice.  I say these circumstances, put her back in.  Yeah, we need a convict in this contest.  Yeah.  The fact that she's in lockup right now makes her even hotter.  That's got to put her back in.  Put her back in the contest.  She's back in.  Back in the contest.  And we need new photos in the orange jumpsuit.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  She's back in.  Tony, tell her she's back in,  and she has to give us a call as soon as she can.  As soon as she gets out, she'll call you guys.  Because if she doesn't, she's out.  Yeah.  Tony.  I'd hire her a real lawyer, Tony.  Tony.  Yeah.  Do you get to hang out with Ron?  I'm sorry?  Who?  Ron.  What?  Just wondering.  You've got to get her a good lawyer.  I know.  Someone out there got it.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  Okay.  Bye.  Thanks.  Bye.  Say hi to Ron for us. 
[03:29:00]  What can she has?  She's back in, right?  Yeah, she's back in.  All right.  There you go.  Put her back in the contest.  None of the other ladies are calling in to stake their case in.  No.  No.  All right.  That's just wrong.  Did you hear about the lady that was stopped at the airport because she had a vibrator and  now she's suing?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They made her take it out of her bag because it was vibrating on the runway. 
[03:29:30]  They had the bag next to the plane, one of the smaller ones that you put your bags  down and they loaded in.  Oh.  It was going.  Yeah, yeah.  What a shocker.  She had to open it up.  Well, that's because you got to get past that crack security.  They got at the airport now and most of these people that work in the security would be  working at McDonald's if September 11th never happened.  I mean, you don't want to give.  Absolutely.  Well, these people, you don't want to give a lot of power to people making $6.25 an hour.  You know, I'm flying here.  They pull me and this 70-year-old lady out of line.  I'm going, oh, great.  This must be some of that racial profiling I've been hearing so much about. 
[03:30:00]  You should just be able to whiz right through security.  Yeah, right.  But no, I got stopped.  Get the Irish guy and the chick with the walker.  I think they're a team.  And we're getting checked for weapons by Jabal, this Middle Eastern looking dude.  He's going through our bag.  He pulls out my nail clipper and goes, you won't be able to board the plane with that.  I'm going, yeah, you're going to be pretty good to hijack a plane with a nail clipper.  You get on a plane, you kick open a cockpit and the rest of the pilots show up.  All right, you take me to Newark.  I'm going to trim your toenails really short so it hurts when you walk. 
[03:30:30]  I'll clip that little pinky toe until it bleeds.  You get this bitch airborne or it's bad pedicures for everybody.  You retardant.  Give me my nail clipper back.  They are getting carried away.  Well, and now everybody's got to take off their shoes.  That's what I love.  Yeah.  The one idiot manages to get on with exploding shoes.  And I don't even know if he knew what he was.  Exploding shoes.  Maybe he forgot he was flying and he wore his exploding loafers that day.  Oh, dang it.  I'm flying and I'm wearing my exploding loafers. 
[03:31:00]  But I'm just saying, you know, everybody's got to take off their, what happens if one  of these lunatics, hey, well, what then?  What is it, cavity searches for everybody?  Some guy with a big vat of KY jelly and a rubber glove standing by the plane door.  You're going to show a picture right in there.  You're going to pull up your pants and make your way to your seat and sit down with a KY  gushy feeling in your head?  I like it.  I like it.  Okay, you're good to get on the plane.  Oh, dang.  But I'm just saying, you know, where do you, where do you, where do you draw the line? 
[03:31:30]  I know they're understaffed on demand, but I think they should let us help out because  we are the ones flying, you know?  I think if you have an American passport and above room temperature IQ, I think they should  hand you a gun as you get on the plane.  Here's a gun for you.  Here's a gun for you.  All right.  You don't get one.  Get in there.  And that way, when Ahmad stands up with his box, he goes, I don't think so, will you?  Sit down and watch Shrek and eat your peanuts. 
[03:32:00]  This baby's going to Newark just like the dick it says.  And you, stewardess, leave the whole can of soda.  The whole damn game, lady, put it down.  What do they got?  One can of soda?  Where they dip a cotton ball in it and squeeze it in a cup?  Oh, there's all this soda beer.  I cannot stand when they give you that half a can.  You know what else bothers me?  The snack pack.  A pack of gummy bears, four Oreos, and some cheese and crackers.  What am I, four?  When's nap time?  What am I, a toddler? 
[03:32:30]  How about an apple?  Something.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I get off on a tangent.  Anytime I ask for drinks, too, especially on the little short hops, if you're going to  Washington or Boston from New York, and I always, I never just get one drink.  I'm like, come on, a couple of Bloody Marys, I'm ready to go.  I don't know if you'll be able to finish that before we have to clean up.  Don't worry.  Don't worry about it.  Don't question me on this.  I've heard that, but under different circumstances. 
[03:33:00]  You know how when you fly, they give you those wings, you know?  The wings?  Yeah, they give you like, you get a little set of wings, you get a little set of wings.  Remember when you were a little kid and you flew and you...  Oh, you're talking like ancient history.  No, they still do it.  No, they still...  Yeah, but I went in to get some wings the other day and they gave me a hazing right  there in the cockpit.  They put them in and just kind of punched them into my chest.  They just hazed me.  I just wanted a little set of plastic wings.  They've gotten so, though, they're very uptight.  Like once in a while, if you see a flight attendant who's got camel toe and you lean over and you're 
[03:33:30]  giving a little tickle.  Yeah.  Now there's a problem.  That's a problem.  Yeah.  Well, they even say that.  You know, if there's anything we can do to make your flight more enjoyable, get the  button.  I hate the bingo.  How about a lap dance, sister?  Come on, cha-cha.  Shake that thing.  And the next thing you know, they're landing where you're not supposed to and the rest  court and you have to plan.  Come on, man.  Come on, man.  What, Mike?  What, Mike?  What, Mike?  You've been waiting for two and a half hours.  What's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to get in trouble at work here.  Watch out for that, boss.  What do you do? 
[03:34:00]  What's he do?  Airport security?  Wait, Mike, why are you going to get in trouble at work?  Huh?  Because I'm supposed to be loading trucks right now, dude.  Do what I do.  Make up a bumper sticker that says, my boss is a jerk.  All right, Mike, what's up?  Oh, man, I just feel so terrible.  I talked her into doing this, you know?  Who?  Huh?  You did not talk her into doing this because she has a website.  She gave it out earlier and she does porno on websites.  Oh, you're defending your wife or girlfriend there?  Yeah.  Contestant number 13.  You're lying.  We kicked her out of the contest, so what's the problem? 
[03:34:30]  Liar, liar.  Put your pants on fire.  Go ahead.  Do the little gag you wanted to do.  No gag.  I just want, you know, I mean, five grand is a lot of money.  We don't make a lot of money with the website.  How do you not?  She's got a face full of pudding in every other picture.  And that doesn't make money?  Mike, your wife's not going to even come close to winning $5,000.  No, we hardly make anything.  Why am I working 12 hours a day, you know?  Mike.  I wouldn't be working 12 hours a day.  So how much is membership for the site? 
[03:35:00]  Uh, I don't even know.  See, you are so, you are so lying.  Do you know what the pictures are on the website?  Oh, sure.  I mean, she's so hot.  She gets me hot and then I join her.  Do you?  I take the pictures and everything, too, you know?  Do you take the pictures of guys?  No, no, no.  It's all just me and her.  We're totally monogamous.  I mean, right now she's looking for a...  Well, that's your problem, Mike.  You need to get a couple other guys in there with some sponsors and jamming three holes,  no waiting.  Let's film some of that.  Let's get that going. 
[03:35:30]  You want to make $24.95 a month?  You got to kick it up a notch.  Well.  Mikey, your wife's out of the contract.  Five grand is a lot of money for us, though.  And really, I mean, she's...  Mike.  She's lying.  Hey, Mike.  That's in the game.  Hey, Mike.  She didn't even have a chance.  Do you understand that?  Mike, you got a better shot of playing.  The publisher's clearinghouse.  Yeah, this ain't working, man.  You're not even pleading a good case.  Sorry.  But the other girl's got, like, UFO nips.  Bye, Mike.  One's shooting off a 90-degree angle, another's shooting off another 90-degree angle. 
[03:36:00]  Bye, Mike.  Hey, Mikey.  My waist area was perfect.  Hey, listen.  Bye, Mike.  Is your finger paralyzed?  Bye, Mike.  No, the wow.  What's the wow about?  Just get to the gag already, charisma of leukemia.  Okay, look.  God almighty, you dull dope.  We're giving you time for your gag.  Get to it.  I'm not going to fall fast on you guys.  No way.  I like you guys.  I listen to you guys.  Is the gag that there's no gag?  No.  Well, that's a good gag.  Wow.  Listen, listen.  No gag gag.  He got us. 
[03:36:30]  Damn it.  No, we just want to win.  I mean...  Well, you know, you got the presence of a gay snail.  Maybe that's your problem.  Bye, Mikey.  Bye, Mikey.  Get to it, Mike.  You're awful.  For a while, you need nips, right?  Well, what's that?  Don't even get me started on his wife.  Boy, that guy was really desperate.  I liked her, actually.  Really desperate.  Really?  I like the wife.  I like the wife.  You know what?  I think it looked like she used lipstick on him.  It looked like she used lipstick on him to make him look bad. 
[03:37:00]  I like that.  For some reason.  No.  No.  Stop.  You don't.  Not lipstick.  I mean...  Don't say you even like that.  Look, she looks like a hammerhead shark.  They're in each direction.  Look.  That's lipstick.  Hold on, you little sweetie.  It looks like two big piles of chew hubba bubba.  That's right.  You see all those bruises from where guys were hitting her with ten foot poles?  That's what you call a Cincinnati Bengal.  Nice uniform, bad helmet.  Savannah is back on the line.  Savannah.  Hi.  Savannah, what's what?  If no other girls want back in, I think I deserve to be back in. 
[03:37:30]  You?  You made me really nervous last time, and I kind of...  I did panic.  One thirty-five.  No, you had your shot.  I know.  Didn't you get my email?  You blew it.  I said you make me more nervous than a sixty-year-old who's doing it for the first time.  These girls are so delusional.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is this the finger-in-the-mouth chick?  Maybe you should not be kicked out.  I don't think so, but you're not top 20 material.  You're not top 20 material.  Hey, guess what?  These girls are delusional.  I'll say this in her defense, though.  She's really dedicated. 
[03:38:00]  She called back five times.  If I come...  If number thirty...  If number eighty-four was standing two inches nude from your face, and I was standing five  feet nude from your face, you'd make the switch.  Number what?  Number what?  Number eighty-four.  All right.  Let me look at eighty-four again.  If I put them in your face and she does, you're going to make the switch.  Where are you from?  Philly.  We like Philly.  Oh, Philly.  You're right in Philly.  I don't like eighty-four.  Outside of Philly.  Hold on.  Outside of Philly.  Where?  I...  You know.  Reading?  Reading, Pennsylvania?  All right.  No, no, no.  We're two minutes from Philly. 
[03:38:30]  I like eighty-four.  You do?  No, I don't.  Come on.  She's not top 20 material either.  No.  Yeah, but I'm a lot closer.  A lot...  If you take out...  How could I not be in and running?  My breasts are beautiful.  I hate...  They just are.  Closer don't matter.  Where's Stinky?  If you get rid of that photo number one, I am in and running.  This calls for Stinky.  This calls for Stinky.  Uh-oh.  Bring in the stink.  Get the picture up so Stinky can see.  Stinky, we don't know what else to say to this girl.  Not her, not her, but Stinky. 
[03:39:00]  This girl thinks she should be back in the contest.  One thirty-five.  It's a wow contest.  Shut up.  Stinky's going to talk to you.  All right.  Bring in the stink.  Who's that?  Wow.  She is convinced that she could win the contest, Stink.  She looks more like...  Look at the second picture.  Shut up.  Stinky's talking.  No one...  No one interrupts Stinky.  All right.  You look like someone's mom.  That's a big problem.  Oh.  And you're annoying and you keep calling, so that's part of it, too.  Because I love you guys.  Yeah, but you're a whore. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, that's not...  Oh, Stinky.  Oh, Stinky.  That was not called for.  She's really ugly, guys.  No onion soup for you tonight at Frenchie's Restaurant.  You'd be lucky to get someone half as good-looking as me, Stinky.  That's right, Stinky.  You'd be lucky to get someone half your age.  I'm 24 years old.  Because I put glasses on, I look old.  Oh, my God.  It's a grit.  Hey, listen.  You look like...  I like her.  She looks like she did a 40-yard dash in a 100-yard gym.  And you sound like...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, God. 
[03:40:00]  Just let it sit.  What does she do?  Stop short?  40 yards, 60 more to go.  All right.  Okay.  I never messed up at work, Stinky.  All right.  You're 24?  You sure you're not looking at your age in a mirror?  No.  I put the glasses on.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Come on.  She looks like she remembers when Carl Maldon used to carry cash.  Hold on.  You sound like Phyllis Diller.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:40:30]  Now she sounds you.  Well, you smell like her.  And you would know, right?  Oh.  You'd be lucky to get someone half as good looking as me.  Let me tell you something.  Don't make me come out there, grab you by the lapels of your shmemon, and pull you on  like a well-oiled sea boot.  Open, Anthony.  I'm not talking...  I love you guys.  Thank you.  But you work with idiots.  Yeah, I know.  We don't know how to control these people out here.  On a daily basis where we know that.  Hey, look.  I've been going to bat for you since they booted you.  This is Jim.  Don't...  I know, Norm.  And I don't think you should have been out of the contest. 
[03:41:00]  And Anthony certainly doesn't think.  So I don't know.  Put me back.  We don't know who kicked you out.  It's your show.  It's called the O.B. and Anthony show, not the Stinky show.  Stinky really controls this show.  Yeah, he is actually the boss.  He's the backbone of the operation.  He's the man behind the curtain.  Not many people know that.  He's the guy behind the guy behind the guy.  Oh, no.  Who kicked you out?  Steve from FoundryMedia.com.  Oh, God.  That's right.  And I believe...  I back up my decision more now than ever.  He's the one who kicked out the other good-looking girl, too, that you were arguing with 
[03:41:30]  controversial.  You look 50.  Well, great.  And you sound 60.  Sylvain, know what you did wrong?  What?  You wore glasses.  I know.  I agree.  That killed it, man.  That first shot is awful.  All kidding aside, you look a lot older than 24 when you're wearing glasses.  Yeah.  Okay.  If I had to guess the age of you in that first shot especially, I would say, and I'm being  honest, I would say I am looking right now at a 38, 39-year-old girl.  You know, ever since you got booted, the guys at YSP, I won't name names, I've been cheering 
[03:42:00]  the decision that you guys made to boot this chick off.  That first person...  They couldn't stand her.  You don't understand.  The chest isn't what it's all about.  It's a nice chest.  If you put your cans on Ernest Borgnine, it's still Ernest Borgnine you're feeling up.  You know what I mean?  So you can't just go on the cans.  Wow.  She has good legs, but it's that face in that first picture.  It's like, who's the chick with Down syndrome in the nice rack? 
[03:42:30]  Look, I can laugh at myself.  I agree.  I don't know what to put between your rack, my mule or a nice metal.  All right, Sylvain.  It's over.  It's time to face reality.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Love you anyway.  All right, Sylvain.  I love her.  There she goes.  We'll blame it on the glasses.  I think the rest of the pictures are good, man.  24?  We better break, Ant.  Jimmy Schubert.  24?  At Rascals, I know, in West Orange all weekend long.  Including tonight.  Don't you have to go?  Yeah, we got a 930 show. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, we're at...  Whatever.  No, you can hang.  I was just worried about you a little bit there.  And he's going to be at...  Chicago, Zanies and Burns House.  Zanies, of course.  Zanies and Chicago next weekend.  There you go.  We'll play What Do We Learn Next.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the Ovi and Anthony show.  Sex for Sam.  3-3-3-3-M-W.  I'm in Atlantic City.

Something totally tomorrow called OP.  A forward move into the next liquid experience.  OP is the finest vodka, but it's way beyond vodka.  It's flavored with natural orange, peach, ginger,  and a little something extra we like to call Swedish tradition.

It's your mother, the woman who brought you into this world.  Hi, Ma.  I've been meaning to call you.  Really, Eric?  My phone has not been ringing.  I asked your father, has Eric died?  Actually, Ma, I've been busy mastering a couple of new video games.  Mastering?  Yeah, mastering.  I've been going to Blockbuster.  They got great deals.  Now I can rent games for a full week for the price of a five-day rental.  So this is a habit, Eric? 
[03:50:30]  No.  Do we need an intervention here?  Your Uncle Ralphie collected baseball cards.  My sister Trudy never saw him.  Ma, I only go to Blockbuster once a week.  I drop off my old games, I get new ones, and keeping them a week lets me perfect them.  Oh, you've changed your major to games, have you?

[03:51:00]  Details at participating stores.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, 1027-WNAW.  Yeah, it's time to play What Did We Learn on The O.P. and Anthony Show today.  Let's get right to it and talk to Chris.  What's up, Chris?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Today I learned a few things.  First, Fred got his bill from the same place Rick got his crabs.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that's good.  Good call, Matt.  Taking your way back.  Clint Howard has nice cans.  Wheelchairs make you gay.  And if Ann has his way, Dave Dickless' daughter will be bringing home Mandingo. 
[03:51:30]  Thank you, sir.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Chris.  What did you learn, Chris?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that when I'm doing the 40-yard dash in a 100-yard gym, I better wear a helmet  for safety.  Bastards.  They don't miss a thing on this stuff.  Way to go, Schubert.  One screw-up.  Jeanette, what's going on?  Hi.  I learned that even a dog can give you the fish eye. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, we did learn that today.  Hi.  Very good.  A couple off the instant feedback.  Sheep lover.  I learned today the funny part about testicular cancer is not the cancer, it's the heartbroken  friends and family.  He also learned you can use dills to ward off burglars.  Todd from Buffalo.  I learned today the challenger and wheelchair Fred both have leaky O-rings.  That's what I was laughing at during the break, by the way.  Mike learned no helmet, no yam bag, not gay. 
[03:52:30]  Very good.  Although I would argue that point.  All right.  Let's go to Christy.  Christy, what did you learn?  Hey.  I learned Norton hates self-sensitive women.  I did screw up.  Yeah, he screwed that one up.  See ya.  All right.  I miss.  All right.  I think we're out.  Yeah, we've run out of show.  I learned that you don't say 40-yard dash and 100-yard gym.  It's the other way around.  100-yard dash and a 40-yard gym.  Otherwise, there's 60 yards to go.  Hey. 
[03:53:00]  Well, she got winded.  She looked tired.  It was a two-parter.  She then took off again and hit the wall.  We all know how it ends.  One time I took a short walk on a long pier.  That's nothing.  This morning, I was in the diner, and they had one of those diners where you build your own omelet,  and one of the ingredients was chicken, which is wrong.  I mean, you don't take the eggs out of a chicken and then cook the chicken and put it in the eggs. 
[03:53:30]  That's too much chicken.  That's a two-generation omelet.  All right.  Destiny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned that if it looks like the Washington Monument, it's time to get a new one.  Yes.  Yes.  Look at you, Panis.  We're going to leave with that one, okay?  Voting for the WOW Contest starts on Monday.
