<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts explaining their office power outage, caused by an overloaded breaker due to numerous electronic devices (six computers, four refrigerators, a boom box, a large printer, a neon sign, recording equipment, a Jaegermeister chilling machine).  Their engineer, Pete Johnson, humorously dismissed their show as an "air show" while detailing the excessive equipment and blaming a coworker, Earl, for the situation. Pete's role as fire warden, and Earl's plan to simply "run" in a fire, were also discussed.  Listeners called in with jokes and offers of electrical help.  The hosts then discussed their upcoming "Crippled Bouts," including planned blind boxing, one-legged fighting, and wheelchair jousting, with several potential participants calling in.  The day's blind boxing match was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict.  A significant portion focused on their building management issues: after-hours restrictions, building passes, and visitor access.  A former building electrician called offering help. The conversation also touched upon a former program director who allegedly stole items (satellite dishes, gold records). A Boston Globe reporter called, leading to a discussion of their Boston radio return.  The show continued with further discussion of the Crippled Bouts.

After a brief Optimum Online commercial, a game involving a "Sexy Noises" CD was played, timing how long it took coworker Craig to cut the explicit audio.  Marco, a guest back from Provincetown, recounted his trip with explicit descriptions of encounters with gay men, employing homophobic slurs and vulgar language.  Randy, a caller, interacted with Marco and exchanged phone numbers.  "Bra Bingo," featuring female callers giving their bra size, followed.  Jordan, a caller, detailed plans for a graphic teen car wash fundraiser and requested an appearance. Chrissy, another caller, expressed confusion at the show's content. A New York Magazine reporter was present in the studio.  The hosts discussed the results of the "Moms I'd Like to Fuck" contest, followed by another round of Bra Bingo.  Angela, a previous guest from the HBO special "Bellevue," called, initially jovial but later distressed after recounting a car accident she'd intervened in.  She sang a song before the show broke.  The segment ended with post-Angela discussion, Hotwire sponsorship mention, another Bra Bingo preview, and mention of Otto, George, and Sandy Cain.

The next segment included discussions of a "cripple bounce" competition, and a disastrous live proposal on the *Today Show*. Vince Vaughn's studio presence, due to a movie promotion, was mentioned.  The hosts then critiqued Al Roker's knee surgery and Regis Philbin's appearances, using crude and sexually charged language.  Otto, George (a puppet), and Sandy Kane featured prominently in highly inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations, with Sandy performing a song about Jerry Seinfeld amidst interruptions and obscenities. Commercial breaks, including a New Jersey Cure Insurance advertisement, were interspersed.

A recurring segment featured Sandy Cain singing a song, repeatedly interrupted by the hosts "dumping" the audio and throwing objects (scissors, a Coke bottle, a videotape) at her.  Otto and George (the puppet revealed) appeared, along with Emma, a woman who lost a leg and recounted her accident without a near-death experience.  The hosts made crude jokes, including numerous sexual innuendos and discussions of sexual acts and bodily functions. Brother Joe's sexually explicit song about Sandy Cain was played. The show promoted Brother Joe's performance, the "Moms I'd Like to F" contest, Stacker 2, Sam Adams beer, and a related online survey.  Emma's future appearance and upcoming events were mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  I love that bit.  That one goes back a couple years.  Well, here it is, 304.  Yeah.  And, um, uh, well, um, we're not prepared for our show.  But we have a good reason today. 
[00:00:30]  We're even less prepared than usual.  Right.  We were preparing for our show in our fine office.  Yeah.  When, um, the electricity went out.  In this modern day and age, Opie, of computer technology and our, uh, complete reliance on, um, electricity, TVs, computers.  Um, we could do nothing.  I didn't know what I, I, it took me five minutes before I even let go of the mouse.  I was just like, what, what happened? 
[00:01:00]  This building hates us.  We're in a pretty impressive office building.  Yeah.  In the middle of, uh, New York City.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  This building is about, what, 40 stories?  Yeah.  And they, they always have a problem with us.  Remember the time we set off the, uh, the fire alarm?  They weren't too happy with that.  I think we were cooking rat that day.  We were cooking rat that day, yes.  Yeah.  And we set off the fire alarms and we had to clear a 40-story building.  Yeah.  And the fire department came up and then the building was pissed. 
[00:01:30]  They didn't want us cooking anything up here.  And now, um, it's taking forever to get a building guy just to come up here, flip the breaker.  The one little 15-amp breaker we got for the entire office with, it looks like a, a, a missile room.  I, I think.  We have so much electronic equipment.  I think they're holding a grudge from, uh, the time we set off the fire alarm.  I think so.  So, the electricity went out about an hour ago and, um, no luck.  And there's things we need from our computers to, to do this radio show. 
[00:02:00]  It was pretty funny, though, watching Pete Johnson, our crack engineer, uh, walking through the office, uh, with Scott Colombo, the computer guy, pointing out all the electronic equipment we have in our office and how much, uh, electricity they use.  Is Pete going to come into the, uh, studio or no?  Pete Johnson, where is he?  Well, uh, I guess the last straw was, uh, getting Stinky a computer.  Yeah, Stinky's been bitching that he doesn't have a computer.  He's got to wait for Opie to leave before he hops on Opie's computer. 
[00:02:30]  So, now he has one.  Yeah, we should explain, um, to everyone.  Our office is no more than 15 by 15.  Top.  Pretty small.  Tops.  And there's five people in there.  Yeah.  And, uh, we have made a list of all the electronic equipment we have in our office.  Oh.  The electricity, electricity should have went out, uh,  months ago, man.  Oh, you're, you're adding to the list, Ben?  I forgot about the neon sign.  Oh, yeah, the big neon sign.  The old English 800 neon sign.  This is all on a breaker that you usually have in your house for, like, your bedroom. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Or something like that.  You even have more, uh, amps, uh, for your living room than we do for this office.  You should see the outlet they plugged, uh, Stinky's computer stuff into.  The one in front of Ben, it looks like, it looks like those pictures in the safety, uh,  magazines do not do this.  There's plugs, there's adapters with, like, five or six, uh, outlets in it plugged into  each one.  The top and bottom.  They call it the octopus.  The octopus.  Yeah.  Rick's down the hall.  Uh, Rick. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, hey, guys.  I'm here in, uh, Pete's nerve center of an office.  Yeah.  And, uh, he can't come down right now.  He looks like he's fixing some wires.  But, uh, he, he has agreed to talk on the phone.  All right.  Here you go, Pete.  Pete's in charge of, uh, all the, look how long it takes to just get to a phone.  All the engineering stuff here at the radio station.  Pete Johnson.  Pete.  Hello.  Pete.  Hello.  Who is this?  Uh, you're talking to Opie and Anthony.  We're a syndicated radio show.  Oh, you're syndicated now?  That broadcasts right down, uh, from your office. 
[00:04:00]  I could be on your show.  And, uh, we have no electricity in our office, as you know.  When is the electricity coming back so we can do our radio program?  Pete.  Well, I, I did my part of it, you know, and I, uh, alerted the building that it was an  emergency.  So, uh, now it's in their hands.  So, how long should that take, Pete?  Well, I just put a second call in and, and I told them that, uh, that it was for, uh, a  very important, uh, air show here, that there was material on the computer that they needed.  So.  Maybe, maybe they're polishing the brass rails in the elevator.  Maybe, uh, they're very busy doing that. 
[00:04:30]  Maybe they're running outside to make sure people don't sit on the sidewalk outside the building.  Or they could be polishing the marble floor for the 18th time today.  Right.  But it's, um, an air show?  What are we flying?  Did you just call this an air show?  Yeah.  We got, like, fighter planes flying around, Pete.  Hey, very important, the air show.  They're outside the building kicking people off the ledges instead of helping us out with  our electricity problem here.  Yeah.  Now, Pete, you looked around in the office, right?  Yeah.  You know us a little something about, uh, electricity and, uh, do we have too many appliances in 
[00:05:00]  there for, for the breaker?  Well, I don't know if you consider, um, four refrigerators and six computers and, uh, one  TV and, uh, other accessories.  Well, I got the list.  I'm going to go down the list.  Tell us if this is too much for a 15 amp breaker.  Why don't I just go down the list?  It's a 15 by 15 office with five people living in there.  Uh, this is what we have in our office at this time.  We have six computers, Anthony.  Six computers.  We have a huge boom box so we can crank out our tunes. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Don't have a stereo yet.  We're working on that.  We have a printer that...  Oh, my God.  How old is that printer, Pete?  It's about six years old.  That's it?  Yeah.  No, it looks older.  You know what it looks like?  It's, first of all, it's huge.  You could get a printer now at home that does more than this printer does, and, uh, it would  be about the size of a keyboard.  Yeah.  And this thing is gigantic.  It takes up so much desk space.  It looks like, remember the Whopper computer in War Games? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Would you like to print a document?  Well, the only thing is I researched the problem, and I think the, uh, the straw that  broke the camel's back was Earl's computer was part and part of your, uh, power, uh, system  there.  We figured out the cubicles right outside our office are also on the same breaker, and Earl's  computer's on there, too, now.  Yeah, so...  The last straw was giving Stinky a computer, obviously.  But what else do we got?  We got equipment.  What does equipment mean?  There's, like, a CD player, and the shortcuts is hooked up. 
[00:06:30]  All the recording equipment that we use to edit some of the bits from the show.  All that stuff.  All right.  Uh, we have the neon sign, uh, uh, Old English.  Old English 800 neon sign that we, oh, we need that.  A TV, a fan, the Jaeger machine, the Jaeger Meister chilling machine, it's...  It's a little bit?  No, yeah, it had to.  It's, it's chills the Jaeger.  It's a little compressor device, a refrigeration device.  And those things take up a lot of energy.  So do the four refrigerators.  And, and four refrigerators, mostly for our beer. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  So what do you think, Pete?  We only have, I think, four outlets in the whole office.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I hope they don't, maybe they're liable to warden off that, that area there, maybe, as  being unsafe in this building.  Yeah, I think it's a fire hazard.  Speaking of fire hazards, is it true, Pete, that you're, you're, uh, in charge of, if we  have a fire on this floor?  Yeah.  You're like the fire, what do they call that?  The warden.  Fire warden.  You're the fire warden for this floor.  Right.  Wow, so what happens, uh, let's say a fire breaks out.  What do you do? 
[00:07:30]  Tell us what, what mobilizes Pete Johnson.  Well, what happens, they, you're supposed to, uh, like, before you evacuate the floor,  you're supposed to go out by the elevators.  We're burning already by the time Pete does anything.  I'll be with you in a minute.  I'm burning.  Yeah, if you get all the people, uh, going down the fire exits, we're going to be trampling  each other.  So what they do is they'll evacuate people from different floors at different times.  But what do you have to do personally?  All of a sudden the alarm goes off.  What do you do?  I make sure, make sure everybody's notified, you know, make sure everybody gets out, you 
[00:08:00]  know, make sure that, uh, somebody isn't left behind.  Somebody might have fainted, you know.  So you will make your way through the smoke and flames.  Pete Johnson, some woman's laying on the floor, dying of smoke and inhalation.  She looks up.  Oh my God, it's Pete Johnson.  We should make it perfectly clear.  Pete's been working at NEW for how many years, Pete?  42.  This may be too much work for you.  You would have to be responsible for people's lives and the places going up in flames.  Pete, if someone's unconscious, you're going to pick them up and carry them out? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, but have you seen the personnel in this place?  What the, what, you know, what are your options in here?  Well.  Yeah.  Most of the guys, uh, don't know how to tie their shoelaces.  So you're going to have, do them the responsibility?  There's another fire marshal on this floor, Anthony.  Who?  Uh, that would be Earl.  Stop it.  Earl Douglas.  Black Earl.  How did he get that duty bestowed upon him?  I don't know.  How did he get to the, where's Earl?  Gotta talk to Earl.  This is an equal opportunity, uh, situation, so.  At least Earl's got some upper body strength, though, if he's got to drag some poor person out. 
[00:09:00]  No, it's interesting, uh, Pete said that the, the last straw was Earl and his computer, right?  Right, Pete?  Right.  Earl decided to turn on his computer today and try to get some work done.  Yeah, finally.  He's downloading porno.  How did he get to, how did Earl get that job, though?  I don't know.  Can we get Earl in here?  I would love to talk to him to see if he even knows what he's got to do if he hears the alarm.  No.  Does he know how to work the big fire hose in the stairwell? 
[00:09:30]  No.  Does he know how to, like, work that thing?  I'm, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that as a racist joke.  It could be, could work a fire hose.  I'm just saying, that's something, it seems like something you would have to know how to work.  Here comes Earl, the other fire warden.  Thank God.  For our floor.  It is we who are your fire dogs.  Earl?  Yo.  Earl, you are one of the fire wardens of the floor.  Who appointed you guys?  They just picked the two people that were here the longest. 
[00:10:00]  And what happens?  There's a fire in the building.  Oh, my God.  Earl, spring into action.  What do you do?  Run.  All right.  At least he's honest.  You don't know what to do.  Can we have a drill to see, you know, you guys in action?  I want to, I would love that.  I want to feel safe.  Let's get a victim.  We'll lay him out on the floor.  Somewhere.  And see if you guys know what to do.  Yeah.  I think they, and you don't even know where the victim is.  We'll hide the victim.  And see how long it takes you and Pete Johnson to find the victim and get him out of the building.  No, I think that we. 
[00:10:30]  I called the building guy.  Now, you know, don't forget.  Did you see the small print in your contract, the latest contract you just signed?  Oh, what?  Even during a fire, you're supposed to man that studio and make sure that there's program going out.  So now that you're syndicated, you know.  Hey, Pete, are you trying to do jokes now?  I got another call.  All right, Pete.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Bye.  Very, very important phone call from Pete Johnson.  Unbelievable.  They made them the fire guys.  So there you have it. 
[00:11:00]  We're still waiting for the electricity to go back on in our office.  Yeah.  Lots of stuff to get off the computers for today's show.  Wonderful.  Let's hit TJ.  TJ, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, you know, I'm usually a supporter of black girl, man, but I'm starting to notice a pattern here.  You know, he screws up on the sticker stops and now the computer shuts down your whole office.  You know, I'm thinking conspiracy. 
[00:11:30]  The black man, something with your computer took out our office.  Yeah, everything was fine.  Just another way for the black man to keep the white man down, guys.  All right.  Thank you, TJ.  It's just a good thing I wasn't playing a computer game that depends on me saving it before I get done.  I'd have been pissed.  No one was weird about that.  So the electricity goes out and then we all just started kind of just staring at each other.  We didn't know what to do.  We don't know what to do.  We are a society just dependent on our little electronic devices. 
[00:12:00]  We really are.  Oh, we can't converse anymore.  It's like, oh, no, we might have to start communicating because we all just stare at our computers and get ready for the show.  I actually had NewYorkPost.com, newspaper, NewYorkPost.com, and I'm reading an article from the Post and the computer goes out.  The New York Post is right next to me on the desk.  I didn't know what to do.  I didn't know how to find the article in the paper.  Yeah.  I was horrified.  Let's go to George. 
[00:12:30]  George, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  You know, you guys got more stuff in your office than most people have in their houses.  Yeah, we just keep bringing more electronic stuff in.  Earl's definitely behind this.  You know, growing up in that poor dirt shack with an ice cube for a refrigerator, you know, he's got a hand in this.  Hold on, hold on, Earl.  Corona, fight me.  Your mic was down.  What?  What did you want to say, George, Earl?  Go screw yourselves.  I grew up in a middle-class family, you white.  All right, George, thank you.  But that one outlet looks really dangerous. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, we're going to have to fix that.  Near Ben's area.  Hopefully they'll remedy the problem.  All right.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, bud.  Yeah, a couple things.  Number one, when are the Battle of Crips going to go on?  Oh, good.  Yeah, our new idea.  We've changed the name to Crippled Bouts.  How about little kryptonites?  Crippled Bouts.  The first Crippled Bout was supposed to happen today.  Two blind guys going at it. 
[00:13:30]  Fighting.  Boxing.  Boxing.  And we're not going to tease everyone and, you know, make believe it's going to happen.  Steve, one of the blind guys, could not make it down today.  He has rescheduled for Monday.  The collective.  Oh, it just happened.  Oh, what a thing.  Pissed off people.  Right.  So we're not going to have the blind fighting today, unfortunately.  We do have the girl coming down with one leg.  We have Adam and George coming in.  Is she the one with the fake foot that actually has toes with painted fingernails on them?  Yes.  Yeah, she paints the toes on the fake leg. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And it's just below her knee, I believe.  She was bragging, saying she's a hottie and she should be here in a little while.  All right.  We are looking for more people to join us with our new concept, Crippled Bouts.  Yeah.  We have two one-legged guys that are going to fight it out.  We're going to have a one-legged guy ass-kicking contest.  What is that happening?  Not sure.  We've got to find out what days are good for both of them.  Yeah, well, sooner than later.  We should do it tomorrow if we get them both down here.  And we have one guy in a wheelchair, but we need some competition for him. 
[00:14:30]  Well, I think the other wheelchair people are scared because that guy is 520 pounds.  Well, we'll do weight classes.  That's a big boy.  So if there's other people in wheelchairs that want in on the Crippled Bouts, this will  be wheelchair jousting.  And we'll give you weapons that you could use, maybe a mace, a jousting lance.  And you guys joust.  Right.  Oh, they'll be valuable prizes.  So please, if you're in a wheelchair, let us know.  Give us a call if you want to come down.  But blind boxing will definitely happen Monday? 
[00:15:00]  Monday.  All right.  I'm hoping Blind Dave calls in because I think he's a little disappointed today.  Yeah, I was talking to him earlier.  He's really pissed off at this guy.  He thinks the guy's ducking him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, let's get Dave on the phone right away.  Yeah, I'm sure he's going to be doing some trash talking.  And let's try to get Steve on the phone right away.  And let's make sure this is definitely going to happen.  Yesterday with the two blind guys trash talking each other.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Oh, I know.  Hilarious, hilarious stuff.  They had their little electronic talking devices.  And they were trash talking each other with that. 
[00:15:30]  A lot of people wondering, why does a blind guy need a talking device?  They read with it.  Because they can't look at the words.  All right.  Well, we're going to try to get electricity into our office so we can get our stuff off  our computer and move on with the show here.  Mark, what's up?  Listen, how are you doing, ONA?  All right.  When that studio was built, I was the electrician, the subcontractor who built it.  And if WNEW doesn't have enough money to take care of you guys, I'd be more than happy  to send a couple of my guys up tomorrow to straighten you out. 
[00:16:00]  Tomorrow?  We need our stuff.  Oh, any day you want.  Whatever's good for you guys.  No, we appreciate it.  But we need our stuff from our office immediately.  I think the building guys have their own maintenance guys.  Building guys?  Yeah.  I don't think we can be bringing in our own subcontractors.  See, our office building is a complete nightmare.  You can't even take packages out of this building without a pass.  I know.  Did you have trouble last night?  No.  I walked right...  The guy was, you know...  I don't know where he was.  And I snuck out with my VCR.  I've been with you when you've got nailed in arguments because you can't bring out your... 
[00:16:30]  You've got that DVD player.  You cannot bring your own stuff out of your office, into your car, or however you're going  to go home.  In this building.  You need a building pass.  You need a building pass, which is the biggest pain in the ass.  And who knows where to get...  Like, where do you get a building pass?  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Are you kidding?  Pete Johnson.  He's in charge.  He's in charge of everything.  He's the secret boss of this place.  Wow.  I'm telling you.  Pete Johnson, so if I have, like, you know, the Samsung, the DVD slash VCR thing, I want 
[00:17:00]  to bring one of those home yesterday.  I had to find Pete to give me a building pass.  So you can walk past the security guy that, like, like the Gestapo down there.  Oh, it's a nightmare.  They hate, like, if you try to walk out of the building after 7 without signing out.  I've done that a few times.  I go to the elevator.  We're not allowed...  Hey, hey, hey, hey!  We're not allowed to...  That's a good point.  We are not allowed to leave this building.  Without signing out.  Signing out.  After 7 o'clock.  I'm pretty fascinated by some of the people that have signed out on the sign-up pad. 
[00:17:30]  I know after I leave every time, there's something like, Quick Draw McGraw left the building  last night at 13 o'clock.  Yeah.  Who else left?  Donald Trump?  I remember I was...  Some of the guys that work down there that check the list, they barely know English,  and they, you know, they look important, and they look over the list, and they're reading  Quick Draw McGraw, but they have no idea.  Quick Draw McGraw, yes, he was here.  I saw him.  Dwight Gooden.  Dwight Gooden?  Daryl Strawberry?  Yeah.  Yeah, Daryl Strawberry visits this building a lot.  Do you ever just do the scribble? 
[00:18:00]  I've been in such a rush, I just go, blah, blah, blah, I scribble, but in the appropriate  spots.  Right.  And then I just leave, and the guy's like, have a good night.  There was one time I had to come back in the building, like I just signed out at 7.  Yeah.  I forgot something, whatever, a wallet or a cell phone, and I had to come back at 7.05.  Oh, you've got to sign in.  Now you've got to sign back in.  And sign out when you leave.  So I'm begging the guy, I'm like, no, you know, I've got a train to catch, you know,  I've just got to get my cell phone.  And he starts pointing at, like, a camera.  Like, I can't let you do that, because they checked the footage on the camera. 
[00:18:30]  Well, then you could see that I just left and signed out.  Exactly.  I remember when I was working nights, you called me and just said, will you let me in  the building?  They won't let me in the building.  Oh, that's another thing.  We've been kept from coming in, because we don't have these photographic building IDs.  Yeah, because after hours, we, yeah, you need to show some kind of photo ID.  You need an ID.  There's a photo ID, building ID.  Do you have one, Earl?  Yeah.  I want to see what one of these look like.  Ben, you have one?  I have one.  I have one.  We don't even have one of these.  Look at this.  Oh, yeah, it's a building ID. 
[00:19:00]  It's got the floor you belong on.  And these guys go crazy.  Remember the day my girlfriend tried to get up?  Yep.  And we got a call upstairs, and it was the desk guy going, she's not allowed up there.  I go, you've got to send someone down.  And I was busy doing something.  I go, no, it's cool.  Let her up.  She's been here a thousand times.  No, we can't do that.  Ben, I was in some mood that day.  I was C-sark.  You effing C-bastard.  If you don't let her up there, if I've got to come down there, I swear to God, I'm going 
[00:19:30]  to punch you in the face.  And the guy's like, I'm just doing my job.  I go, how long you been here?  I go, you're a newbie, right?  Because I know all the other a-holes that work down there, at least know us.  No, we used to have some guys down there that were really cool to us, but they had moved  on.  What's his name?  He used to be great.  Warren.  Warren.  And this guy's like, no, I've been here six months.  I go, ooh, ooh, six months.  Oh, right, you're a veteran.  Send her up, Deke.  They think they treat this place like there's military secrets up here on the ninth floor. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, but then the first ones to throw you off are sitting downstairs by the Brooklyn  Diner when you're out there having your coffee.  They'll throw you right off.  Who is it that's getting so crapped on in their personal life that makes these decisions?  All right, go out there and kick those people off.  If I'm miserable, they've got to be, too.  They've got to explain on a really nice day.  People like to sit outside our building on the ledges and have coffee and check out the  girls going by and what have you. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, when we were doing that like two or three weeks ago, it took them five seconds  to realize we were on a ledge and they come running out of the building to chase us away,  right?  Yeah.  Even though we work in the building.  The electricity has been out in our office for over an hour.  Yeah.  And we can't find anyone to help us out.  Well, this little break isn't going to make them run up here to fix it any sooner, I'm  sure.  What?  They don't listen to our show, do they?  I don't think so.  Quick break.  Blind Dave on the phone. 
[00:21:00]  He's kind of bummed out that, you know, Blind Steve is backing out today.  I'm sure he won't call him a pussy.  He's convinced that Blind Steve is backing out for good.  We'll get to the bottom of that next, okay?  Toll free in New York, 877-692-1027.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You won't have it.

No.  Sometimes you're as thick as a creamy planted job.  Don't be such a pinnacle-horny goat weed.  What does that even mean?  I'm not sure. 
[00:22:00]  All on the next, Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3, 1027.  WNEW.  This is the story of Stanley and Susan.  One day, Susan told Stanley to...  Get off the couch and build us a new fence and shed.  If you want a new fence and shed so badly, go build it yourself.  Just when Susan was about to pack her bags, they both heard...  Of course, M&Dollers.  They've been manufacturing and installing fences and sheds since 1961. 
[00:22:30]  And the man on the radio says that all listeners get a free gift with every fence or shed installed by M&Dollers.  Just mention this ad.  Plus, they give a lifetime warranty on all of their fences.  Ten-year warranty on all the sheds.  And we don't have to worry about painting our new shed.  M&Dollers sheds come pre-painted in a variety of colors.  So come on, let's get over to M&Dollers.  Good idea!  M&Dollers with locations in New Hyde, Park, Baldwin, and Amityville.

[00:24:30]  If there's a fire, no worry.  People just stamp it out with his chin dildo.  Yeah, Pete, the engineer who's been here for 42 years,  who's in charge of getting us out of the building in the case of a fire.  Yes, he has been known to wear chin dildos when he's not working hard here at WNEW.  Girls right on the chin dildo as it was strapped to his chin.  Also, Frank from Manhattan O&A,  how did that former PD steal all the goodies from the prize closet 
[00:25:00]  and get it out of the building without a pass?  I know.  Oh, oh, you know that?  Ben knows?  Wait, wait, we've got to explain to everyone.  Actually, it was a magic.  Yeah, you guys got to understand something.  This radio station we broadcast from sucked like you wouldn't believe before we got here  and when we were here for a while.  Yeah.  And a lot of people that worked here could give a flying F,  and it used to be a legendary rock station,  and people just decided to start pilfering the place. 
[00:25:30]  The PD that we had here was a real clown.  He hired this promotions guy that knew nothing of promotions,  and it was told to me by a few people that he might take a few things out of the building if he felt like it.  Things like satellite dishes,  direct TV systems, two of them.  You know what?  Gold records off the wall.  Let me tell you something.  Stuff that would put the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland to shame. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You're talking about like Led Zeppelin lithograph signed by the entire band.  Just insane stuff you just can't find anywhere else.  Yep.  It's all gone from this building.  Oh, DVD catalogs, too, that used to come in?  Oh, everything.  So how did he get it out of the building without a press?  How did I get DVDs and satellite TV through the security?  I actually caught him doing it.  What did he do?  I hid it in a Pop-Tot box.  He came in really early and took a huge box,  and he put all the stuff in this huge box and sealed it and gave a building pass to Eddie 
[00:26:30]  and had Eddie bring it down, and then he met Eddie in the garage.  You mean live and lie, Eddie?  That's right.  Oh, my God.  That's what he did, because no one's going to question Eddie.  Wow.  Some scam.  Well, all right.  There you have it.  Anthony, Jim Sullivan's on the line.  Hey, Jim.  Oh, Jim.  Yes.  Jim Sullivan.  Yes, indeed.  From the Boston Globe.  It's ONA.  We got you live on the air.  Hey, man.  Is this PBS? 
[00:27:00]  Why is that, Jim?  Why are you saying that, Jim?  Well, the tenor of the conversation, it reminded me of public broadcasting.  Yes, it sounds just like it.  Yes.  I mean, you were just discussing chin dildos, I believe.  The chin dildo, yes.  Yes, of course.  Our head engineer was, what was that on?  Maybe, I think Don and Mike.  Very good.  He was on their show, and he had a chin dildo.  We feel that chin dildos are just not getting enough attention on the airwaves.  We don't think you look that silly wearing one.  Do you want to see those goddamn things? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, God.  No, no, I haven't, actually, but I'm looking forward to seeing it.  You know, all I was doing was calling up you fellas to see if I could get a photo of you,  the Dynamic Duo, emailed to us.  Is that a personal photo for your own home, Jim Sullivan?  No, it's actually a usable photo for the newspaper tomorrow.  I thought you wanted an Opie and Anthony picture in your house.  Yeah, we do have cute ONA-like posters you can put up in your room.  Well, actually, my bathroom is wallpapered with those already, you see.  Oh, wait, no, that's the toilet paper roll.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, hey. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  I'll give it to him.  I'll give him that one.  Thank you.  Gentlemen, we're doing a little item again.  Should you explain to your audience about your situation in Boston?  Well, yeah, it's heating up in Boston.  That's where Anthony and I made our name, even though we're from New York,  and we got fired for saying the mayor died in a car accident.  I think everyone knows that story by now.  Yep.  We're now syndicated, and a lot of people are still very surprised that we're not syndicated to the place we, you know, got our start.  That's right.  And really built our popularity. 
[00:28:30]  We should be in Boston.  What is the status right now?  What do you know?  Are you going to be coming here?  We are coming to Boston.  Okay.  We will be live in afternoons in Boston in a matter of weeks.  A matter of weeks.  Where it's going to be, Jim, who the hell knows?  Okay.  All right.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes.  If it did not work out with one of the infinity stations, and WBCN is the primary station here, I guess, in Boston, that way,  you might go elsewhere, and your old boss of WAAF, Bruce Mittman, might be interested in you. 
[00:29:00]  Do you think that's a possibility?  Don't get confused, though.  Bruce is no longer with AAAF.  No, no, no.  I know.  At WFNX, he has moved to another station.  We would definitely work for Bruce if it didn't work out.  The pleasure of annoying that little midget would drive us insane.  It would be great.  Is our boss still driving around in that huge gangster suburban, even though he's like a five-foot-two Jewish guy?  Well, yes, actually, I believe he is. 
[00:29:30]  He's supposed to pick me up and play golf on Monday.  Jim, I'll come pick you up, but I can't get into my vehicle.  I lost my rope ladder.  If you could give me a boost into the front seat, Jim, I'll pull around back so it's not too embarrassing if people see us,  but please give me a boost.  A boost.  I need a grappling hook.  I'll allow you in my country club if you give me a boost into my gangster suburban.  He's a rep, man.  We like Bruce.  Yeah, I know.  I do.  You wouldn't mind carrying my clubs, Jim, if we have you at my country club. 
[00:30:00]  Bruce, he took the hit with us at AAAF when we got fired there, and he's a stand-up guy.  He kept in constant communication with us, and we hung out.  We talked, and he's a good guy, unlike other people at AAAF.  Unlike Dave Douglas, the reason why we will not go back to AAAF.  So you will not go back to AAAF?  No, and let it be known, that offer was floated out there, too.  Okay.  We will not go back to AAAF as long as Dave Douglas is in charge of that place, that little weasel. 
[00:30:30]  That little sneaky little weasel.  Worm.  Do you like him, then?  Do you guys hang out socially?  Oh, I haven't talked to him since we got fired, Jim.  Oh, boy.  We haven't talked to the guy since April 2, 1998.  He backpedaled so hard to save his own ass, he didn't even call us nothing.  There was nothing after we got the boot.  Well, I'll tell you.  Well, look, let me ask you this about Boston, then.  We have BCN as the primary, like the big rock station.  Of course, if you're there, it becomes much less of a rock station. 
[00:31:00]  Well, BCN's just flat out being stupid, because everyone knows if we go to Boston,  we're going to be number one in afternoons without even trying.  And for some reason, that is a problem to BCN.  We don't get it ourselves.  Is it still in negotiation, as far as you know, then?  Huh?  You're still negotiating, though.  Is that correct?  Yeah, they're trying to figure it out behind the scenes.  Trying to work it all out.  You know, BCN's been the proud heritage rock station in Boston for many years,  and I think they're having a hard time letting a little bit of that go,  regardless of the fact that if we got in there, we would do very well. 
[00:31:30]  But the bottom line, like I said, we will be in Boston.  In a matter of weeks, in Afternoon Drive.  Now, whether it's on BCN or not, we'll be seen.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  But I can't, personally, I can't see Infinity Broadcasting letting us go somewhere else.  Okay.  It wouldn't make sense, I mean, to pay all that money for you guys,  and then to just have you be competing against an Infinity Station, right? 
[00:32:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  There you go.  Well, look, guys, it'll be in the Globe tomorrow.  Thanks for your time.  You need a picture?  You want a sexy little number and some lingerie?  Yes, that would be lovely, please.  What kind of picture are you looking for, Jim?  Well, probably a...  Ah, you suck.  Come on, he's going to trash us now.  Jim's always been pretty cool with us.  Tell Jim something happened with the phones.  Yeah.  He'll probably call back now, and then we'll give him the silent game.  God, it's just an S-storm up in Boston. 
[00:32:30]  Well, they know.  It is just amazing.  If it wasn't such a huge deal, I mean, this wouldn't be going on.  They know they should just put us on at that goddamn station.  The media is going to go absolutely insane when we go back to Boston  because of all the trouble we caused when we were there.  Yeah.  Man.  But we wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Blind Steve hung up.  Blind Steve hung up, but we got blind Dave.  Blind Steve calls back.  Of course, a lot of people checking out the show today 
[00:33:00]  because they thought they were going to hear some blind boxing  with Dave the Blind Guy and Blind Steve.  Steve backed out today because why, Rick, do we even know?  Yeah, he had an important meeting he could not get out of  which ran, you know, way too late for us to get him in here  because we had a car set up and everything.  So, Blind Dave, you think that Steve is ducking you at this point, right?  Yeah, my buddy told me last night, he goes,  that dude ain't going to show up.  Really?  I had one of my friends take off work this afternoon. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't find out until, like, what, almost 1230?  Yeah.  An hour before the car was supposed to come.  Yeah.  So you will not be boxing Steve today.  I know.  That sucks.  I look like a tool.  I told all these people I'll be on the show tomorrow.  No, you will be on this show boxing.  Just not today.  What do you have to say to Steve?  Well, I didn't call up trash talking him.  He called up trash talking me. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, for all I know, I don't know,  maybe the guy is bigger than me, maybe he can kick my butt,  but I think I'm either going to, like, lose miserably  or beat the living crap out of him.  You want to fight a judo expert?  Hell no.  Wait, I'm going to put this guy on.  Blind Rich?  This is Blind Rich.  He won medals.  I'm no tough guy.  He won medals.  He's a blind judo expert.  Rich!  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Shows move.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, what's up, Rich?  I was tuning in to hear the fight, 
[00:34:30]  and I was, you know, despondent that it's not going off.  Yeah, everybody is.  We're a little annoyed with that, but.  Throws a wrench in the day.  Yeah, I called up.  I had spoken to the fellow who screamed.  I had told him.  What the hell's going on with the phone?  All right, hold on, hold on, man.  His phone's blind.  Yeah, we'll try him again in a second here.  Blind judo guy.  Dave, you still there?  Hello?  Dave, you're there, right?  Yeah, I don't want to fight a blind judo guy.  I'm not nuts.  I don't want to be blind and crippled.  Well, here's another possible opponent for you, Blind Noah. 
[00:35:00]  Noah!  Yo, what's up?  You're blind as well.  Oh, I'm almost blind.  Almost blind?  What kind of sight are you at?  What kind of sight?  What kind of sight you have?  I only can see straight in front of me during the day.  You got RP?  Yeah.  Me too.  Hey.  There you go.  What's RP?  I can't see straight in front of me no more, though.  It's called retinitis pigmentosa.  Ah.  And now you can only see right in front of you.  What's the rest of it look like?  The rest of it's pretty shady all around the sides at night. 
[00:35:30]  Nothing.  Can't see anything at night.  So it's just like dark, and then you got kind of a tunnel vision thing going?  Yeah.  Just a little tunnel vision.  That's pretty much it for me.  Wow.  If I box this guy, I want both of us with blindfolds, because he'll be able to see a hell  of a lot better than I will.  I'm in the final stages of RP.  Yeah, I would come in, like, if I was listening to this, I would say, yeah, I'm a blind guy.  I'd come in, wear some sunglasses, take them off, do something wacky with my eyes, and I'd  just pummel the guy. 
[00:36:00]  I'd come tappen in with, like, a cane.  Yeah, grab my cane.  I got three extra canes.  I was going to have my buddy say he was a blind guy, and, like, he just showed up.  See, that's a good idea.  I'm going to get the hell out of someone.  Dave, you have a six-sense humor.  I love it.  Noah, you want in?  Well, here's my big thing, dude.  Like, out of nowhere, my friend comes in with his cell phone right now.  He's like, dude, what we're doing is doing this blind boxing thing.  You've got to get in on it.  And I'm like, and I'd listen to it yesterday, and, like, I said to my friend, Nico, so I 
[00:36:30]  was like, Nico, dude, this guy, first of all, he sounds like he can kick my ass, but second  of all, he went to a school for it, for God's sakes, man.  Yeah.  Like, he's like, he knows his stuff.  I don't know.  I'm a little worried about it.  I don't know no judo, dude.  No, Dave, this is a blind Noah.  This guy isn't the judo expert.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, no, I think that you guys would be pretty equal, and we'll put blindfolds on you to make  sure that you can't see.  I took fencing, and I have two of the blindfolds. 
[00:37:00]  I would box someone who could see if they'd wear one of the blindfolds.  You can't see nothing through these things.  A sighted guy and a blind guy.  Oh, yeah.  I'd knock the hell out of a guy who could see because he ain't used to it.  I don't know.  I don't think we need the blindfolds, though.  I think we've got to play it with just being blind.  Well, I want this guy, Steve, though.  We'll turn the lights out.  He talked a bunch of trash about me.  I mean, you know, I didn't talk nothing about him.  He talked about me.  Yeah, we got it.  We're trying to get Steve back on the line here.  I'll bet you any amount of money he's going to wimp out. 
[00:37:30]  I was in the school.  You know, there was people like him.  It's like, yeah, they're computer wizards.  They've been blind their whole life.  He's a nerd.  He's good on the computer.  That's all he's good at.  He probably never got laid.  He's a little wuss.  Well, he backed out, apparently.  Hey, Dave, what would your strategy be?  I mean, God, I want to see this so bad.  I know.  I want to do this so bad.  I was ready to go, man.  Well, Rick is swearing that it'll happen Monday. 
[00:38:00]  But you know what?  I think we're going to have to recruit some more blind guys to make sure this happens just in case.  Well, you know what?  I was supposed to leave Friday for Boston to see my girlfriend, so I'm post-honing.  No, to be with your girlfriend.  Get it straight.  Okay, wait a minute.  See, so to speak.  Well, Anthony, you just said to the reporter, so people will see us up in Boston.  Oh, all right.  So to speak.  So to speak.  Bigger of speech.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  But I'm holding off on the pooh-ha to stick around for this boxing match.  I want this guy, Steve, and, you know, that's going to be three days of pooh-ha I'm not getting.  Hey, Sting.  I want to push him up against the ropes and just pound his head in.  Blind Steve had to go to his meeting, so he's going to call back at 4.30, 5 o'clock.  His meeting for the virgin loser blind people.  Wow.  You know, Steve and Dave have to fight. 
[00:39:00]  I know.  We have to get them to fight.  I don't think we could get them to stand.  It's definitely personal now.  No, would you come in?  Dude, to be quite honest, I would come in to watch him kick the crap out of Steve, to be honest.  Oh, you want to kick Steve's ass, too.  Oh, come on.  I can't really hit someone if I'm not pissed at him, though.  All right, hold on.  Now we've got blind Matt, friends with blind Steve on the line.  Hold on.  All right.  Let's add him to the mix here.  We'll get my big friend to beat you up.  Hey, Matt, what's going on? 
[00:39:30]  What's up, fellas?  How are you doing?  You guys roll?  Hey, thanks, Matt.  Yeah, I've been friends with Steve for a while.  He has boxed a little bit.  He is a tough dude.  I don't know if he could take Dave.  I've never seen Dave box.  Or, excuse me, not seen, heard Dave box.  But if you can't get anybody down there Monday, I'm in.  You're blind?  Yeah.  You're a boxer.  No, not at all.  How blind are you, Matt?  Total.  Totally blind?  Totally.  For how long?  For how long?  Since I'm five.  Five.  I'm 31.  31. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  I'm 32.  You know what?  I ain't in shape.  I don't work out.  I'm no boxer.  I'm no badass.  Just a guy badmouth me.  So it's like, if I go in, if I get my butt kicked, I get my butt kicked.  But what I can tell you about Steve is he talks a good game.  He's a real nice guy, Dave.  And he would totally be a gentleman to you.  He might kick your butt with the gloves on, but he's a gentleman.  You know, Matt, why don't you fight Dave?  Well, I don't want to steal Steve's thunder. 
[00:40:30]  You know, if Steve can't make it, then I'll fill in for him.  Let me tell you guys something.  We need blind boxing tomorrow, not next Monday.  I know.  I'm getting off.  Who the hell could wait until Monday?  I say if Matt or Noah or Dave can make it down, you know, tomorrow, we do it tomorrow.  Yeah, I was there today.  I can't do it tomorrow.  Potentially Thursday.  Matt could do it Thursday, Dave.  Potentially.  Dave, what about you?  No, see, he's saying potentially.  I may have something to do.  Dave needs definite, because it's a real hassle to get a blind guy to New York City. 
[00:41:00]  I get there every day.  I canceled appointments today.  Right.  Cancel all appointments.  Cancel your appointments.  I'll tell you one thing I could beat Dave at.  Bong hits.  Bong hits.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm 32.  You know, I'm a little past the friggin' retard stage.  I gotcha.  That was fun when I was like 14, you know.  It's still fun.  I'll drink you under the table.  All right.  We're going to put all the blind guys on hold. 
[00:41:30]  We're going to try to figure this out.  Blind Steve's going to call in about a half hour, and we'll work out the details, okay?  I don't wait in a half hour.  Thank you a lot.  All right.  Blind Dave, do you fall over when you drink?  Hell no.  How the hell do you keep your equilibrium without being able to see?  Well, every time it's like every time another piece of sight goes, you're a little off balance for a couple of days.  So, you know, who's going to know?  You bump into things, you know.  Yeah, it's a blind guy, you know.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:42:00]  You got an excuse.  I'd be like, hey, there's a drunk blind guy, though.  If you're in a bad mood and you're, like, going through a heavy populated area, you could just, like, slam people with your cane.  No one can really get mad at you, you know.  If I was slowly losing sight, though, I would be looking at naked girls until the last friggin' piece went away.  Oh, dude, there's, the beautiful thing is, there is now, I'm not there yet, but I'm almost there where there's no such thing as ugly women.  Oh, yeah.  Imagine that. 
[00:42:30]  You got to look at the bright side.  Hey, that increases your odds, man.  You know, I do have hands I can feel, so fat chicks are a no-go, but...  But ugly.  You're the blind guy that doesn't want fat chicks.  So if a chick has a butter face, what the hell do I care?  I can't see it.  Right, you don't care.  You can't see it.  As long as the rest of it is nice.  They're always making the moves on us, those big ones.  Oh, yeah, you get the sympathy lays all the time, you know.  That's like Rocky Dennis, how to go after the blind chick in the mask. 
[00:43:00]  Remember that?  Oh, my buddy who was going to come with me, he used to come up to the blind school to visit me.  I went out to the van to say goodbye to him, and this other blind dude's like, oh, he's banging that chick Marie in his van.  I don't think you want to go bother him.  Why?  He won't be able to see it.  He's up there picking off the blind chicks while he's coming to visit me, you know.  Dave, you're a riot, man.  Dave's all right.  We've had him on the show a bunch.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to get all you guys... 
[00:43:30]  I'm Louie.  We're going to get you guys all on hold.  All right, dude, you guys suck.  All right, hold on.  There you are.  God, I got to say, blind people, the funniest handicapped people.  I'm saying it right now.  Funnier than brain damage.  Funnier than crippled.  Wouldn't you say that?  Yeah.  Funnier than deaf people.  Although deaf people are funny without trying to be funny.  You know what I mean.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  We should have deaf people as the blind people's corner people. 
[00:44:00]  Can we do that?  I had blind people live next door to me in East Northport.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  They'd start fighting, and you'd hear...  First, you'd just hear them, like, signing real loud, and they're smacking their hand.  And then they'd get so mad that they had to start yelling.  But it would just be like...  And I'd wake up, like, holy, what is going on outside? 
[00:44:30]  And they're out in the yard.  Like, you could take it inside.  And the daughter, they had a young daughter that lived next door, and she could hear.  And you could just tell she was embarrassed as hell.  It's like, get in the house.  Please go in the house.  My friends are outside.  Just a big boop.  That's funny.  Yeah, it was awful.  Deaf people, corner people.  All right, we've got to get blind boxing happening sometime this week. 
[00:45:00]  We can't wait until Monday.  We just cannot wait.  All right?  Jason.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, Jay?  What's happening, man?  Not much, man.

Yep.  The email today, un-effing-believable.  A lot of folks digging it in Cleveland so far.  We've only been on a week and a half.  Mm-hmm.  Flipper arm wrestling?  Yeah, maybe, Rick. 
[00:46:00]  We have to take a break.  Politomide baby wrestling.  Speaking of deaf people.  Yeah?  Here's a little gag from the O&A archives.  Old Bill trying to get a hearing aid.  They're hearing me.  May I help you?  Hi, they call.  My name's Bill.  I have a hearing problem.  Yes.  I need a hearing aid.  All right.  May I send you some consumer information about that?  What?

We do not sell hearing aids, Bill.  What?  We do not sell hearing aids.  Don't yell at me, Missy.  No, no.  I wouldn't think of it.  I need information.  I understand that.  What? 
[00:47:30]  They call my name's Bill.  Yes, I understand that, Bill.  I got a little rascal.  A little rascal, huh?  What?  And you got a last name, Bill?  Let me look at my license.  Wait a minute.

[00:50:30]  We got a CD in, Anthony.  Yeah, what is that thing?  It's so funny.  We get stuff sent to us every day.  And, well, this CD's called Sexy Noises.  Sexy Noises.  Sexy Noises.  And the fine folks that make this CD are convinced that we can get this on the radio.  All right.  Want to play a little game with the dump guy?  See how long it takes for him to dump out of our radio show?  All right.  How long do you think we can play this? 
[00:51:00]  I would guess less than a minute.  We will start the CD, and we'll see how long it takes for Craig down the hall to dump out of the show.  Sexy Noises.  That's all we're going to say.  We'll tell you what the CD's all about after we play the game, okay?  Okay.  So let me start up Sexy Noises.  What do you think?  Ten seconds.  Ten seconds, and he'll dump?  All right.  We got a guy near the dump button, so we'll know when he dumps from his little closet.  Here we go.  A little taste of Sexy Noises. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, I didn't see you there.  I'm all wick.  I just got out of the shower.  Sorry, I'm not wearing any clothes.  That's okay.  I just got this towel around me.  My long, brown hair is soaked.  God.  Is that okay with you?  Yes.  You want me to go over to the bed?  You're such a nasty little boy. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, God.  So far, so good.  Just take off the towel.  Grab my chest.  All right.  All right.  You might as well slide your body up and down the way it's all wet.  Massage my shoulders. 
[00:52:30]  Massage my shoulders.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what a turn on you are.  I think it's time for you to get dressed as well.  Yeah, I do have that.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you got excited pretty fast, didn't you?  Oh, that's nice. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  We're getting reports it ran out completely, like just one right after the other, right down to nothing. 
[00:53:30]  No.  On one machine.  We want to know when he dumped out the first time.  It was on the line, we know.  Oh.  So the rest of it went through?  Yeah, the rest up to that point.  I was wondering why he didn't dump out right away.  I'm listening going, whoa, you can't say that.  He should have dumped out of that.  No way to say that she was talking about her cat?  No.  Oh, no.  We can't.  Maybe there'll be a way.  We're not going to win that argument today, Anthony. 
[00:54:00]  Just a little taste of sexy noises.  Yeah.  We'll play it from time to time today.  That was the first track called I Am Soaked.  I Am Soaked?  Yeah, because you just got out of the shower.  Yeah.  Of course.  I Am Soaked.  Gay Mark Go.  I'm wet because I just got out of the shower.  Oh, God.  Please stop it.  Let's go, you ass.  Oh, you're a bad boy. 
[00:54:30]  That was so not a turn on.  For you, maybe.  So what's going on?  How was Provincetown?  Provincetown was delicious.  Should tell everyone Provincetown, the gay capital of Massachusetts.  The gay vacation capital of Massachusetts.  It's a beach community up there in New England, and that's where all the gays go for the summer.  For every 100 people there, 99 are gay and one is straight. 
[00:55:00]  Really?  Oh, it's like total, total, everybody's gay.  And you can see because tourists still come to visit it.  And you can tell, you know, they're walking around these little families, and they're like shocked.  Why?  What's going on that might shock a family gay market?  Well, you know, guys walking down the street in drag and in dresses and...  Do you like the flamboyant fags, Marco?  No, ew, no.  You don't like the guys in drag or nothing like that?  No, ew. 
[00:55:30]  Friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  What kind of gay guys do you like there, Marco?  I'm like Rick.  Like Rick?  Oh, what kind of gay guys?  So you like the muscle a lot, gays?  Yeah.  All right, calm down.  Look, he's all whipped up into a frost.  So what did you do this weekend in P-Town?  So I went with my friend Bucky, and I drove up to P-Town and...  Wait, you have a friend named Bucky?  Bucky.  Bucky?  Bucky, yes. 
[00:56:00]  Is he a gay guy, too?  No.  Of course he is.  He's blind.  He's really...  But actually, we're ex-friends after this weekend.  Why?  Because we had to share a room together.  And we had a limit that you had to be out with your partner.  By 1 o'clock.  And I...  Door chain.  I couldn't get in.  I was so pissed.  Wait, he was inside the room with a gay guy, and you couldn't get in?  He was inside the room with two guys. 
[00:56:30]  Two guys?  Yes.  And?  And I couldn't get in.  Two gay guys, man.  So I had to go down to the pizza place and hang out.  I was pissed.  No, not the pizza place you talked about.  Oh, it's horrible.  The pizza place is where you go when you weren't lucky during the night, right?  Exactly.  Now, what happens is, if you go out to the clubs and you don't get picked up, then you go to the pizza place.  Because the bars close at 1 o'clock.  So everybody goes to the pizza place to hang out.  So I had to go to the pizza place.  I was so embarrassed. 
[00:57:00]  Did you finally find a gay man, Mark?  But let me tell you, I met the most dreamy gay man.  Oh, my God.  His name is Greg, and he's from Salem, Massachusetts.  And he totally bewitched me.  He is so gay.  He is so dreamy.  Now, okay, tell us about your date.  We met at the beach.  Well, first of all, we got there on Thursday night, and we checked into our little guest house.  Howdy, faggot. 
[00:57:30]  It's a lovely, lovely guest house.  It was called the Copper Fox, and it's owned by a gay man, and it's so beautifully decorated.  So the first day we got up, and we had a little breakfast.  They serve you breakfast at the house.  And then we went to the beach, and we're laying on the beach.  And I look up, and there was this, like, gorgeous man sitting, like, a few feet away from me.  This is so not hot.  I know.  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  We'll play another track from Sexy Voices in a minute here to get the bad taste out of our mouths. 
[00:58:00]  Don't put it that way, Opie.  Please, never put it that way.  But, I mean, now I know what Marco's thinking when we have girls in here, and they're discussing their sexual exploits.  Exactly.  All of a sudden, I know what Marco is thinking when he hears those girls' stories.  Totally disinterested and disgusted.  All right, continue.  So, well, I didn't talk to him because I was, like, so embarrassed.  Because he was wearing this, like, little thong bathing suit and let nothing to the imagination. 
[00:58:30]  But his body was absolutely perfect.  So, we went to the beach.  We wanted to have some little lunch.  And then Bucky wanted to do some antiquing.  And that's what I call...  Antiquing.  No, no, no.  It's just the gayest thing you guys do.  No.  I call it antiquing.  See, he likes old men.  So, I call it antiquing.  So, it's called antiquing when you go trolling for old men?  Yeah.  He likes old men with lots of money.  So, I call that antiquing.  Where their yam bag is hanging down below their knees? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  And their hiney cheeks are, like, hanging like flat pancakes.  Wow, that's hot, Marco.  It's not.  Saggy man ass.  But he likes them old because the old ones always buy them lots of gifts.  So...  What a way to spend your weekend.  Saggy man ass.  Nothing sadder than old gay men, Marco.  Well, then they fall asleep by 8 o'clock and then he goes out and he finds young ones. 
[00:59:30]  And you call me after a tram.  Yeah, baby.  So, I did a little shopping because they have lots of little boutiques around there.  Did you do anything manly?  Yeah, what was the manliest thing you did this weekend?  Um.  Um.  Oh, I was well-watching.  You can only imagine what that means in the gay community.  He was searching for Moby Dick.  Yeah, fat, fatties. 
[01:00:00]  Chubby chaser.  All right, well-watching isn't that manly, but all right.  It was boring, too.  And it was like three hours.  So, you went to the boutique.  Did a little shopping.  And then we went to tea dance, which is in the afternoon.  They have a little, we have cocktails and you dance.  And it's called the boat slip is the name of the bar.  The bar.  Those gay bars have the best name.  The boat slip.  The mind shaft. 
[01:00:30]  Great pile driver.  In the afternoon, they have like cocktails and dancing.  And I'm on this big deck outside.  It's so much fun.  Can you just say happy hour drinks, please?  Yes, yeah.  Oh, you know?  You've been there?  No, I just don't say cocktail.  Lots of Cosmos.  Lots of Cosmos.  The universal beverage of the homosexual.  So then what?  Mike's Hard Lemonade.  I like that, too.  Mike's Hard Lemonade.  Oh, okay. 
[01:01:00]  Yummy.  Mike's Hard Lemonade.  Right.  All right, and what else, Marco?  So, we went to the tea dance, and that's where I met Greg.  I saw him across the deck, and I was like, oh, he looks so yummy, luscious.  He had the most dreamy blue eyes.  And I went running over to him.  He was like, hello, my name is Greg.  I'm from Salem.  Are you from Boston?  No, I'm from New York.  The sounds of Janus.  It was like, some enchanted evening. 
[01:01:30]  You may see a stranger.  Oh, it was like, oh.  It was actually romantic.  I actually didn't sleep with him on the first night.  Oh, look at you.  Wow, look at you holding your butt back.  Look at you saving yourself.  Well, I wanted him to think I was pure.  Yeah, what were you healing from the night before?  Well, I didn't want him to think I was a tramp or anything.  Oh, so this guy was someone special. 
[01:02:00]  Yes, he's very special.  So you waited for the second night.  Yeah, what did I wait for the second night?  I got to ask the gay guy something, Gay Marco.  What do you give up for someone special?  Like, there are ladies out there, you know, they give up the, you know, the balloon knot for someone special.  There's always something they'll give up for someone special.  That's what you give up.  Yeah, but you're already giving that up.  You know what I mean?  Well, no.  There's girls out there just giving up the peach, but then they find someone special and they feel like, well, I'm going to give them something special. 
[01:02:30]  I'm going to give them the balloon knot.  Well, some people, they just do, like, rub.  Like me, I give up everything if they're hot.  What could he possibly be saving?  A nostril?  I mean, there's nothing this guy hasn't done.  Okay.  But if I'm really not into them totally, like, I'll just do, like, the oral thing and that's it.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  So even if you're not into somebody, you're giving that up.  Exactly.  Or, like, drinks.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey. 
[01:03:00]  Congratulations on syndication.  Thank you.  I'm a gay guy.  I love you guys.  Yeah, but listen to this.  So you enjoy our show.  I do, definitely.  First of all, I mean, Marco, you're great.  You are kind of a fag.  Marco.  Yeah?  Can you hear Randy?  Yes, I can.  He's calling you a fag.  That's what I am.  All right.  He's not denying it.  All right.  So what's your point, Randy?  I mean, he's just, he's flaming.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Someone is listening to the radio, and that's a long delay, and you're just going to screw  up our show.  So turn down the radio. 
[01:03:30]  Not me.  All right.  So what do you want to ask Marco?  Well, where do you live, Marco?  In New York?  Yes.  Go to Hawaii.  You want to go out sometime?  No.  Are you cute?  Yeah, I'm 25.  Ooh.  Um, 5'10", weigh about 195.  Oh, you're a chubby little boy.  No, no, I lift weights every...  Shut up, dude.  You're a chubby little guy.  I lift weights every day.  Oh, yeah?  That's the 195.  Oh.  Of muscle, then.  Right. 
[01:04:00]  See?  Someone's listening to the radio.  Turn it down.  Now I'm having fun.  Randy, I'm going to hang up on you.  It's not me.  Marco doesn't listen to the radio when he's on.  He's not stupid.  Doesn't he?  All right.  What else, Randy?  Um, well, what does he think?  What?  I think you sound luscious.  Yeah, you know, the guy from Salem is not going to call you, by the way.  Hey, how do you know that?  I just do.  You don't go to Provincetown to meet...  Whoa, hey, ho. 
[01:04:30]  Hold on.  Easy there.  Slow down there, Sal.  Sorry, that's why I can't say that.  They just go to P-Town to have sex.  Yeah, like Spiritist Pizza is the place he's talking about.  Yes.  People hang out in front of the pizza place.  It's called the Pepperoni Factory.  People go there.  You gay people.  People go there at 2 o'clock in the morning to get...  You know, those are the people who didn't hook up at the A House.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  No, thank you.  Oh, and O and A, let me introduce some terminology to you guys.  Yeah.  The ultimate thing to do, you guys were just talking about. 
[01:05:00]  Like, I guess girls get something called the balloon nut.  Yeah.  Well, for gay guys, it's called the glass-bottom boat.  The glass-bottom boat.  You know what that is?  What?  That's when you take a piece of saran wrap.  Yeah.  I don't think that made it through, but we'll try our best to...  Hold on.  Did that make the radio?  No, probably not.  Watch how Ant does it.  All right.  What you're saying is they put saran wrap over one guy's face... 
[01:05:30]  Right.  ...and then deliver what is commonly called the Cleveland steamer or the hot lunch.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to let you gay guys go.  So, Marco, what do you think?  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  If that's what you're into, I'm going to pass.  What?  No, I was just...  They were just asking what's the ultimate...  Well, you can email me.  My email address is heygaymarco at AOL.com.  Is that your picture on Foundry Music? 
[01:06:00]  No.  That older guy?  That's Liberace.  That's Liberace.  Oh, is it?  I thought it was Wayne Newton.  They call each other fags.  I know.  What do you look like, Marco?  I feel better calling guys fags now.  Marco...  If the gay guys are calling each other fags, we can do it.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Marco.  Yes.  Describe yourself to Randy.  All right.  I'm 5'11".  I have short brown hair, beautiful green eyes, a luscious body. 
[01:06:30]  I weigh 170 firm pounds.  Hold on.  You can't ask him how big that is in that terminology.  Can I do it again?  No, no, no.  Just...  No, Marco heard you.  Marco, just throw a number out there.  What's wrong with him, Randy?  Seven.  Seven?  Seven?  Yes.  Ugh.  What's wrong with seven, Randy?  I've got about two inches on him. 
[01:07:00]  Ooh.  All right, Marco.  Look, we've got to go.  Isolate that.  Ooh.  That was the gayest sound.  Ooh, Billy.  Hey, Marco, what was the name of your friend who went up to Provincetown with you?  Bucky.  Bucky.  Isn't he the guy on Big Brother 2?  No.  That's the gay guy on Big Brother 2, Bucky.  Oh, really?  Oh, is that his name?  Is he the gay guy?  All right, you guys, we're pretty much done with you.  Marco, thank you.  You're more than welcome.  I'm gayed out. 
[01:07:30]  So, Opie and Anthony, can you send us out on a date?  Ah.  Hey, like having your dad grabbed.  Hey, Randy, you got Marco's email address.  I do.  Yeah, so just send me an email.  If you guys hook up, you can call us up and let us know how it works.  Got milk?  All right, guys.  Sounds pretty good.  Thank you.  There goes gay Marco and gay Randy, Anthony.  Wow, that was a gay little segment.  Call free 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  A lot of people very pissed off after that last segment. 
[01:08:00]  Frank, what's going on?  Is this what we're going to do for ratings?  Please hope you didn't pin your hopes and dreams on a gay Marco.  No.  Hey.  Why?  What's the matter?  We can't just show...  Oh, come on, Anthony.  Every 20 minutes, it was 19 minutes too long.  We can't just show alternative lifestyles here on this program?  Oh, yeah, it could be alternatives, you know, for about maybe 30 seconds. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  You know, I'd rather listen to you go wind on another subject than gay Marco.  All right, all right.  We'll get the bad taste out of our mouths by playing...  Please do.  I mean...  By playing another track from Sexy Voices, Anthony.  All right.  Why don't we find out how long this is going to take before the Dump Guy dumps out of this?  Okay.  It's our new CD that came in.  They want an interview with us, I guess.  Yeah.  They want to be on our show to promote this CD called Sexy Noises.  So we're going to start track two and see how long it takes for the Dump Guy to dump out of this, okay? 
[01:09:00]  All right.  Okay.  Isn't it a beautiful night tonight?  Okay.  Look at all the lights out there.  No, sorry.  Sorry.  That ain't going through.  That one ain't going through.  Wow, that took 11 seconds. 
[01:09:30]  It ain't going to happen.  11 seconds?  It's such a nice night.  She wants to do something very naughty on the top of the building.  It's a four-letter word that ends with, uhk.  All right.  Let me try another one.  Track three from Sexy Noises.  See if this gets through.  Is this going to be all for you, sir?  Okay.  Let me just wrap this up for you.  Actually, we have a few questions to ask you.  Why don't you follow me into the back? 
[01:10:00]  Ah.  That happens all the time.  Yeah, here's the question I have to ask you.  Uh-oh.  Would you mind taking off your clothes for me?  Yes.  Well, I can help you if you need help.  I can take off that buckle.  Hmm?  And the zipper.  What about my purchase?  Oh, God, baby.  I bet you never had sex in a department store, have you? 
[01:10:30]  Yes, I have.  With my girl.  I've had my eyes on you the whole time you've been shopping around.  It's because I'm black.  You thought I was going to steal something.  Are you ready to what?  You can't say that.  Are you ready to...  I don't...  Whoops.  Whoopsie.  Well, okay.  All right. 
[01:11:00]  We pushed our luck with that one.  She's a dirty little girl.  What department store is that?  I've never been to that one.  Where's that one located?  I have a couple of questions.  Could you come in the back?  We may have to get the gayness out of this show and play bra bingo next, Anthony.  That would be nice.  Get out the bingo cards.  Get out the bingo cards?  Sure, why not?  Hey, where's the girl with the one leg?  The hot girl with the one leg? 
[01:11:30]  She should be in about between 5 and 5.30.  I thought she was going to be here by 4.30.  No, that's...  All right, all right.  We'll go to the FU line as we take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony.  The FU line.  Yeah, this is Danny.  I want to give out a big FU to my boy, James.  Always turns into a big pussy when his girlfriend calls.  Dude, she lives in Pennsylvania.  You haven't even boned her yet, and she's 16.  Grow some goddamn balls, man.  You still my boy?  But FU.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU out to all these goddamn friggin' moron summer school kids. 
[01:12:00]  It's bad enough during the year when these f***ing jerk-offs are all on the bus screaming like a bunch of animals.  But then in the summer, you get the real brains running around, hanging from the rooftops of the buses like a bunch of f***ing monkeys,  scratching their initials into cars at the bus stop.  F*** you all, you goddamn animals, you goddamn monkeys, thick.  All you friggin' idiots shouldn't be in summer school to send you right to jail.  Two months in jail for the whole summer.  FU. 
[01:12:30]  End of message.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  Oh boy, here we go.  What is this copy about?  You know, a Major League Baseball's all-star game?  Gonna be played tonight.  Tonight, that's right.  Sam Adams is asking people all across the country,  which one of the following world-class baseball pitchers from past and present would you like to share a pitcher of Sam Adams with?  Nolan Ryan, Cy Young, Satchel Paige, Roger Clemens, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Pedro Martinez, Greg Maddox, don't know, or other. 
[01:13:00]  Personally, I'd like to share a pitcher of Sam Adams with blank.  Because, put who you choose here.  Hmm.  I'll say Roger Clemens.  He could throw the pitcher at me when we're done.  He gets to pitch against a fag boy, Piazza.  Easy.  What?  I can't wait to see it.  I can't even defend the guy.  Get rid of that blonde hair.  Oh. 
[01:13:30]  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Ram Jam.  Black Betty.  From the Flow soundtrack.  Hello.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  877-692-1027 is our phone number.  We want to play Bra Bingo.  Yeah.  Haven't played that in a while.  Yeah, but we want the fine listeners to play along at home. 
[01:14:00]  You're hanging out with a bunch of people.  This is a great game to play.  Want to explain Bra Bingo in?  Well, let me have one of the cards.  Okay.  It's a fun game.  You can play along at home.  We'll give everyone a chance to make up their bingo cards before we actually play the game.  So, yeah, you got to make a blank bingo card.  You know what that is.  It's got a one, two, three, four, five across and five down.  Five by five.  Five by five card with the free spot in the middle. 
[01:14:30]  Free boob, we call it.  It's the free boob spot in the middle.  And what we do is we take calls from the ladies.  They will call up with their bra size.  And the card will have different bra sizes in the boxes instead of just numbers like regular bingo.  And when a girl calls and gives her size and it matches one on your card, you X that one off.  And then when you get five in a row, up, down, side to side or diagonal, you win bra bingo. 
[01:15:00]  What you got to do, though, to make your card at home is get the five by five card and then pick random bra sizes.  Yeah, don't put all the obvious ones in a row.  Yeah, you put them all in a row.  That's cheating.  We make our bingo cards through a computer.  Very, very random.  They spit out random bra sizes all over the card.  Anywhere from, what, like the 32A, AA, all the way up to like a 44DD. 
[01:15:30]  48F or something like that.  I don't know.  Yeah, there's a couple of freak sizes that we throw in there as a goof.  And then you mix them all up and you pick them out of a hat or something and just fill in your card.  Right.  So you'll have about ten minutes to get your bingo cards together, right?  Yeah.  We'll play bra bingo.  Five by five card.  The middle square is the free boob.  You get that for free.  It's already X'd out.  And fill in your card with random bra sizes.  Are we going to get a home winner or just let them play at home? 
[01:16:00]  Just if they're hanging with their friends, you know, smoking dope and stuff.  It's a good way to pass the time.  All right.  We got a guy on the line that has 30 girls for the teen car wash, Anthony.  Jordan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you, man?  I got 30 girls lined up.  I'm fresh out of high school, so they're all just turning 18.  And they weren't...  Wait.  How did you get a hold of 30 teenage girls?  Okay.  Well, yesterday I had a victim.  You guys inspired me.  We got 30 girls.  We called up everyone we knew. 
[01:16:30]  They're all going to be wearing matching T-shirts that say,  We're owned by Jordan and Adam.  That's me and my friend.  And they're going to have Wow on the back.  And if I can get more than that, can I come meet you guys?  If you get 30 girls, you can meet us.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  I could probably do some crazy stuff, too.  Well, here's the deal with the teen car wash.  Pimp in the high school.  Yeah.  We want to make this happen next week, if possible.  We need a space, a huge space.  We want to make a lot of money for some charity, still to be determined.  And yeah, we're going to have teenage girls washing cars all day long. 
[01:17:00]  And squeegeeing windshield.  Yeah.  Teen squeegee as well.  And they're going to wear little half shirts with no bras on and, you know, nice little tight shorts.  And we're going to have a fun day.  Yeah.  Tonight we're going to Kmart.  We're going to buy their jerseys.  Nice.  As they call them.  Lip white T-shirts.  No, they've got to be little, you know, baby tees.  No, we're going to cut them down.  Yeah.  You better cut them down.  Damn straight.  For some reason, we can't find a location yet.  I'm very surprised.  Come on.  We need a place that a lot of us can hang out for the day. 
[01:17:30]  And cars can drive through.  Yeah.  Easily accessible.  Easily accessible.  Obviously a place that has a lot of traffic.  So.  Oh.  As soon as we figure it out, we'll let everyone know.  But, Jordan.  All right, man.  I just want to let you guys know.  We got you.  Yeah, you're like, you're a Tyler Durden to us.  We're starting up little branches of stuff that you guys do.  Tyler Durden.  Nice.  A little fight club action.  Yep.  We got little fight clubs in all these little cities all over America now.  We got a little Opie and Anthony, you know, thing happening in Columbia.  We got, we filmed teenage girls making out, all that kind of stuff. 
[01:18:00]  If you can invite me and my friend in the studio, we got some stories to share.  All right.  Bring the videos.  Jordan, all we ask you is to be cool.  You know that.  I know.  I know.  I know.  No, no.  It's all legal.  It's all legal, guys.  All right.  Cool, Jordan.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Chrissy.  Chrissy, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  You're on the radio.  What's going on?  Oh, just was turned into a 92.3.  We normally had a lot of music on, and then I heard these guys on, and I didn't know what 
[01:18:30]  was going on.  Oh, you listened to extreme radio in Cleveland.  Yeah.  Right.  And it was a new station, I guess, just came out a few weeks ago, and I loved it.  And on my drive, you know, home, I didn't hear any music, and I didn't know what was  going on.  Would you like to talk to programming, ma'am?  I know.  That's all right.  Do you have a complaint about the station, or a show on the air?  No, not at this time.  Then why are you calling?  Just trying to figure out what was going on. 
[01:19:00]  Are you guys going to be on all the time, or?  Yeah, what the hell?  We're going to be on all the time.  Sure.  Oh, well, there you go.  I guess that answers my question, then.  Are you enjoying what you're hearing, or what?  I don't know.  To be honest, it kind of sounds like Howard Stern's show.  Oh, that old gag.  That old gag.  All right, Chrissy.  Oh, whatever.  I love Howard Stern, so.  All right, Chrissy.  Well, we're going to be around for a while.  Give us a listen, okay?  All right, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Thanks.  She wasn't biting.  No.  We need some girls to call for Bra Bingo. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  877-692-1027 as the guys get their bingo cards together, Anthony.  Yes.  Who's playing today in the studio?  I'm going to play.  Anne's going to play.  Rick's going to play.  Ben, you want to play?  Sure.  All right.  Want to get the guy from New York Magazine to play?  Oh, no.  He's just here to observe?  Just observing today?  Or you want to...  I'll play.  You'll play?  All right.  The guy from New York Magazine.  It's exciting when you get almost all of them.  You get four and you're like, oh, I'm almost there.  I need one more.  New York Magazine doing a little piece on us, Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  We had Rolling Stone in here yesterday, New York Magazine.  Yeah, I heard.  That made me really happy.  I can imagine.  All right.  Here.  Pass out the cards.  Thank you.  Well, here.  Does everyone else have a...  Find the best one.  I'm not looking for the best one.  Take one and pass it back.  Yeah, you can't play two cards and don't look for any trends in the...  I need a pen. 
[01:20:30]  Bra size.  You think everyone's got their broad bingo cards made?  I would hope so.  Five by five card.  Middle square is the free boob square.  Just random bra sizes everywhere else and you can play along at home, okay?  Uh-huh.  We should get like a, you know, a broad bingo card up on the website where they can download...  We should have a program.  You download and get a random broad bingo card with all the sizes in it.  That makes much too much sense.  Why not?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll give them like one more minute just quickly.  Don't forget to vote for the mom you'd like to F on WNEW.com. 
[01:21:00]  We're announcing the winners tomorrow finally.  Oh, yeah.  That's still going on.  Early in the show tomorrow, we'll announce the winner to the trip to Myrtle Beach, okay?  Is the voting close, Opie?  It's really close.  That's why it's important that everyone votes.  We've got five ladies left.  Three out of the five will win something from this contest and two are going home with nothing.  Sure, it's close.  It really is close.  Shut up, man.  Close to over. 
[01:21:30]  No.  Sure, it's close.  It's close.  You want to know the truth?  What?  There are two girls.  Two girls.  Fighting it out for that trip to Myrtle Beach out of those five.  That's not giving anything away, right?  All right.  Yeah.  Which two?  All right.  I know this one and this one.  Which one?  Let me see.  You might be wrong when everyone knows.  No, I wouldn't say a word.  This one?  Uh-huh.  And that one.  Uh-huh. 
[01:22:00]  Correct the moon, though.  And how close is it?  Honestly, it's really close.  Let me see the voting.  You're lying.  No, I'm not.  No, he's not.  Get the latest vote from Steve or Scott Colombo.  It's really close.  All right.  Have Steve get that for me.  All right?  Because I'm not believing you after I saw yesterday's results.  No, it's really close.  Go to www.com and vote for your favorite mom you'd like to ask.  Very important.  As the contest ends, the voting ends like at 3 o'clock tomorrow,  and then we'll announce it early in the show.  All right? 
[01:22:30]  Okay.  I think we've stalled enough, Anthony.  I think a lot of people who want to play broad bingo with us have their bingo cards ready.  All right.  Let me look here.  And we get to meet a lot of fine ladies during this contest.  You know, I'm hoping to cover every city we're on in with broad bingo.  So if you're from a city besides New York, let us know.  Okay?  All right?  So broad bingo.  Once again, five-by-five card.  Random bra sizes.  Don't put all the good bra sizes in a row.  That's cheating.  And then the center one is the free boob square.  Okay? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's start with Laura.  Laura, hello?  Hello.  I'm from Queens.  36 D.  You're saying 36 D?  Yes.  All right.  Let me see if I have that.  I hope so, because how?  Mike.  Oh, okay.  God damn it.  I was...  You don't have 36 D on your card, Anthony?  I do.  I got it.  Everyone should have 36 D on their cards.  Are they nice, Laura?  Oh, they're very nice.  Oh, yes.  And what...  You even told me so.  And what are you doing today? 
[01:23:30]  What am I doing today?  Yeah.  I just got home from work.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you going to be tanning in the nude or anything?  No.  No, not today.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  36 D, a very good size.  Yeah, that's an easy one for everyone.  Everyone has it in the studio, right?  Okay.  Nope.  Laura, wait, wait.  Ian from New York Magazine, you don't have...  You don't have a 36 D?  No, I'm missing it.  Man...  Oh, that's a D?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Rick's penmanship sucks.  Oh, that wasn't me.  It was great for the intern.  Oh, it was? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, her penmanship's fine.  Let's move on to...  Lauren.  Hi, Opie.  Hey, what's that?  How are you?  I'm doing good, Lauren.  How are you?  I'm 38 full D.  38 full D?

That's the chick from the road show who wants to be my latest stalker. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, really?  Is that why we're going?  Why are you hung up on her so quickly?  I don't want to deal with that right now.  She is a wacko.  Let's go to Liza.  Liza.  Hey, what's up?

Me too.  Thank you, Liza.  No problem.  From Philly.  I don't think I've ever won Bra Bingo.  Huh?  Opie like has this fixed, I think, or something.  No, I don't.  Liz, you're next for Bra Bingo.

Someone sent us new pictures from the road show, and I don't even know if we could display  any of these pictures on any website.  Brand spanking new pictures of you from the road show.  This guy.  Can somebody send them to me then?  Because there's only that.  I've only seen that picture 48, and I don't know about the money shot, you know?  Well, this guy has a picture, a close-up picture of your peach.  Very close up. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, it's...  Well, I don't need a picture of that.  It's full screen on the computer monitor from hip to hip, and from just the area.  And Liz...  It's a nice wax job, though, isn't it?  Yes.  And Liz, I didn't know you only had four fingers on your right hand.  Yeah.  I learned something.  At times, I do only have.  I thought she was missing a finger.  Yeah, I know.  That was very graphic, the picture.  If you want to see pictures of Liz and a lot of pictures from the road show, go to WNAW.com.

And it's doable.  It's a doable size.  All right, let me go to Joyce.  Hey, Joyce.  Hi.  Hi, what's going on?  Nothing much.  How are you guys doing today?  Is this Joyce from under the console?

And you're driving home from work?  No, I'm laying in the sun all day.  Oh, cool.  Oh, sunning yourself.  Yes.  Sunning those beautiful watts.  36 Cs.  Oh, oh, oh, my God.  Are you serious?  I win.  I've got it.  You won Broad Bingo already?  You're welcome, Anthony.  Yes.  Thank you. 
[01:29:00]  That is a very nice bra size, too, Heather.  Yes, it is.  I have the best sizes.  Are you in a little bikini?  I am.  Nice.  Nice.  Let me call out my sizes.  A 34B, a 34D, my free boob spot in the middle, a 36C, and, of course, 38D.  There it is.  I win.  Finally.  Heather.  I never win.  I'm sorry, Opie.  You're killing me today.  I'm sorry. 
[01:29:30]  That was a quick game.  That was a quick game.  It usually takes a little longer.  We might have to play another one today.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  That means someone's going to have to make up more bingo cards.  We've got some extras.  We do?  Playing around.  And it gives people at home a chance to make up their card.  All right.  Yeah.  If you guys want to play the second game of Broad Bingo today, five by five bingo card.  Center square is the free boob square.  And then you've got to put in random sizes all over the place.  Don't put all the popular bra sizes on the road like I did.  Heather, hold on.  I'm going to give you something.  Thank you. 
[01:30:00]  For being the winning bra size.  Hold on.  There she goes, Heather.  Wow.  I never win that game.  And I won quickly.  Right when I was bitching about it.  Now I just seem like I was whining.  Angela.  Hi.  How are you?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Good.  I just wanted to ask you if I could come down and bring in my CD that I sang on.  And I just wanted to actually thank everybody for being so cool to me because I really appreciate it. 
[01:30:30]  This is Angela from Bellevue.  Yeah.  You're still in the Moms I Like to Have contest.  Thank you.  I just want to say that, you know that?  I'm a joker.  I'm a smoker.  I'm a midnight joker.  Is she back on the pants?  She's back on the pants.  Whatever.  I'm just.  I'm a wacko.  I love you guys.  I love you seven years.  Thank you.  You inspired my life.  I'm a wacko.  I'm a schizo.  Really?  You inspired my life.  Angela.  You really did because I was on the bottom of a bottomless pit and I just want to thank you. 
[01:31:00]  Really like the song.  Angela, it sounds like.  I know.  I'm okay.  I just want to thank you.  Angela, it sounds like you sound like the kooky Bellevue.  See?  There we go.  We'll be in a straight jacket now.  Take me.  Angela, it sounds like you're on the meds.  Let's quickly catch everybody up on this.  Angela, if you watched the HBO Bellevue special, Angela was one of the people that they focused  on in the special. 
[01:31:30]  It aired right after one of the episodes of Sopranos.  So I'm thinking a lot of people saw it.  And she was the one that her dad died and her cat got taken and put back in the North Shore  Animal League.  And she was singing to Daddy's Home and reaching in the air and saying, I love you, Daddy.  And acting really kooky.  Weren't you, Angela?  Yeah.  I love my father so much.  I love my father.  You don't even know.  When he died, a part of me went like this.  This sounds just like it did. 
[01:32:00]  I love him.  Do you hear the music, Angela?  Yeah, I hear it.  I love told me, oh, baby, it rocks in your eyes.  Sing along, Angela.  Sing along.  Your daddy's home.  Sing like you did at Bellevue.  Your daddy's home to stay.  Sing along, Angela.  I can't.  Oh, no.  Holy cow.  Angela, don't cry.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  Oh, no.  This is the real Angela again. 
[01:32:30]  What happened?  What happened?  I'm okay.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  We've been able to joke about that for like the last 24 weeks.  No, I'm laughing and crying at the same time.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I had a spiritual awakening for you guys.  Oh, we're going to have to bring Angela down.  Angela, where are you?  I'm at a friend's house.  Actually, a friend that actually saved my life last night.  What happened last night? 
[01:33:00]  What?  John Kissed Salad.  What happened last night?  I have a lot of friends.  No, I've been really down lately because nobody really understands like what happened to me like in my life.  Oh, no.  So what did you try to do?  No, no.  I've been trying to protect my family like my whole life.  You know, and I love them so much, and I love you guys.  You know, people put you down all the time, and I'm always sticking up for you guys.  Well, yeah.  Thank you.  I'm a warrior.  I was a...  No, really.  There was a car accident, and I stopped it on Bear Ridge Parkway and Fifth Avenue. 
[01:33:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  That's all right.  We dumped out.  I'm so sorry.  So these people what?  These people were trying to like, you know, get away, and I stopped it.  You know what I mean?  I just wanted to...  I was going to ask her, what is she insane, but...  No, I'm not insane.  You know what?  Are you crazy?  You don't get involved.  I am.  Don't get involved with anything.  You know what?  There's too many people dying out there.  I just want to be heard.  And people need to chill and have peace in this world, because if we don't, we're going to die of broken hearts, man. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, Angela.  No, I really mean it.  You're sounding a little down.  No, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Believe me.  Wow, Angela, what happened?  No, I'm fine.  You're having like a little relapse.  We haven't seen this side of you yet.  No, I swear.  You know what?  You know, I just want to be heard, but just like everybody else.  When do you want to come down, Angela?  I can come down tomorrow.  All right.  Come on down tomorrow.  Yeah, I'm good.  You all right?  They're coming to take me away.  Ha-ha. 
[01:34:30]  No.  I have to joke about it now, because I've been through so much.  I trained with Tony Pinto, who trains with Tucker and Chuck Norris.  The medication's on work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  The medication's on work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Hello?  Oh, David, oh, David.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, sorry. 
[01:35:00]  Do it.  I need it.  Oh, God, no.  Daddy's home.  Daddy's home to stay.  Yeah.  Angela?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm laughing.  My friends make me feel so much better.  I danced at Peggy O'Neill last night.  It was talent night.  All right.  No, I'm okay.  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  I'm walking around with no top on right now. 
[01:35:30]  Nice.  I'm wowing it right now.  Nice.  34B, as in boy.  All right, Angela.  I'm okay.  All right.  Make sure you're all right.  Yeah, I'm fine.  I just needed...  Are you on any meds or anything?  No, I don't.  I'm actually going to see my therapist this week.  Yeah, I'm good.  You get in there.  All right, listen.  Yeah, I'm fine.  You know what I mean?  I know what reality is now.  Okay.  I know what's real, and I love you guys so much.  You keep on doing what you're doing.  You're not doing anything wrong. 
[01:36:00]  Don't ever let anybody tell you you're doing something wrong.  You should do what you wanted to do.  All right, Angela.  All right.  I love you guys.  Angela, thanks.  I'm okay.  Okay.  Angela.  I'm okay.  Please, please, man.  All right.  We haven't asked you in the last 10 minutes.  Angela.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Wait, wait, wait.  We're going to break, and I want you to sing us out.  Sing something as we go to break here.  All right.  This is Angela from Bellevue.  Trails for sale rent.  Rooms to rent 50 cents. 
[01:36:30]  No phone, no pets.  I ain't got no cigarettes left.  Two aisles of pushing room.  Bye-bye.  Two of whatever room.  Man, I'm in.  King of the road.  That's it.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow, Angela.  I love you guys.  Bye.  Oof.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Okay.  Terrific. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  Just when Tommy wants Angela in the death pool.  No, Tommy.  Tommy.  Calm down.  Tommy.  What the hell is Tommy out of his mind?  Tommy.  Tommy.  I can't get it?  She's right on the edge.  Calm down.  Come on.  If you were talking on the phone, we would have to go even better.  Like, how much does Daddy miss you?  You miss Daddy.  Sons of bitches.  She's on the meds, baby.  She's on the meds.  You know, Jay makes a good point on seven.  Jay?  There's definitely something different going on here. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  There's a huge difference between the last time Angela was on our show.  No question about it.  Well, that's what happens when you have some kind of thing going on like that in your brain.  Some days you're fine, and she was fine for quite a while.  And she sounds okay now.  But there's just this little...  You know what it is?  You're hearing a little bit of the Angela that we saw in the special, just for the fact that  I guess she was a little down.  Yeah.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Peace, boys.  It's kind of a manic thing, you know? 
[01:38:00]  It goes kind of up and down.  Sully?  What's up?  Hey.  Two words.  Cable guy.  All right.  Holy crap.  Awful.  I can't believe she started crying.  That's horrible.  I don't think she was going to cry.  We had played that song 20 times.  We goofed on that part of the special a million times.  All right.  We might play another round of Broad Bingo, because that one took way too...  It was quick.  Too quick, yeah.  Yeah, it was really quick. 
[01:38:30]  And it'll give people time to make up their cards.  Well, congratulations, Anthony, on the fine Broad Bingo win.  Yes, Steve, from foundrymusic.com.  Speaking of Broad Bingo, I just got off the phone with my programmer, Jeff.  He's working on a program that will randomly create Broad Bingo cards.  Wow, look at you guys.  Ah.  And you'll be able to get that on foundry music?  All right.  You'll be able to print them out and play along at home.  Easily downloadable.  Or you'll put the Hubble telescope in a new orbit.  One or the other.  Right.  With the ease of navigation, that is foundry music.  Exactly. 
[01:39:00]  I can't even get mad anymore.  Ah, thanks, Steve.  That website is gold-pounded, though, man.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's a great way to catch up on the show if you're new.  Right.  And if you're an old fan, you get all the new stuff on there that we're doing lately.  And that's F-O-U-N-D-R-Y-music.com.  Well, there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's O&A.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:39:30]  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  Anthony Hotwire.  Brand new sponsor to the O&A Show.  Yeah, you know, one-third of airline seats are flying empty every day.  Can you believe that?  One-third of the hotel room's empty.  Same thing with rental cars.  That's where Hotwire comes in.  Hotwire partnered with major airlines, hotels, and rental car companies  to sell empty seats.  The special negotiated rates are called hot fares,  and they can really save you a lot of money.  No one wants to lose money on all the empty seats. 
[01:40:00]  Now, with Hotwire, no one has to.  A customer from Charlotte, North Carolina, bought a ticket on Hotwire  for a flight from L.A. to North Carolina.  Cost $219.  Same flight.  Info on another website.  $436.  Lots of savings with Hotwire.  That's a hot fare, and that's what you'll find if you take the Hotwire travel challenge.  So try the rest, then log on to Hotwire, and get a hot fare.  Hot wire. 
[01:40:30]  Fares may vary, so try Hotwire for yourself right now.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  Hey! Hey!  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  877-692-1027.  A lot of ladies on hold to play another round of Broad Bingo, Anthony. 
[01:41:00]  We have Otto and George outside the studio.  Do they get two separate cards if they play?  We could have Otto and George play with us.  Also, Sandy Cain is upstairs.  I don't know why she stopped by today.  I just came down and said, oh!  And we have a girl that's really hot with one leg stopping by as well.  We thought.  She wants in on our cripple bounce.  Yeah!  Well, we got a lot of people coming out of the woodwork for that, 
[01:41:30]  but none we could really team up with competition.  Yeah, well, we got to team up all the cripples.  I know!  We're getting, like, a guy in a wheelchair, but then we got a one-legged guy.  And we got a blind guy.  And a deaf guy.  We're just trying to organize it.  The blind boxing will happen.  Yeah.  Sooner than later.  Later.  Because we have about five or six blind guys that want to box now.  It was supposed to go down today, but blind Steve backed out on us.  He had a meeting or something.  Yeah.  I hope he's legit, because Dave is really pissed off at Steve. 
[01:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  That could be a really good blind fight.  A lot of people say we should have a...  Hey!  Hey!  ...a blind Royal Rumble.  That'd be a little much.  That would be insane.  Hard to call.  Hey, really fast.  Was anyone else watching the Today Show this morning?  A guy made a complete fool of himself.  No, I missed it.  You missed it?  Yeah.  I usually don't wake up that early.  I was tooling around, and there's a guy, a young guy.  He couldn't have been more than, like, I don't know, early 20s. 
[01:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  In the front line.  And he asked his girlfriend to marry him, Anthony.  Yeah.  So they get back from commercial.  You know, he does the whole plea, I love you, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah.  I want you to marry me.  Ah, a very popular thing to do on the Today Show.  Now, the Today Show eats something up like that, of course.  Love it.  So they get back from commercial, and they said, you may have been watching whatever this guy's  name was, you know, ask his girlfriend to marry him.  Well, we have his girlfriend on the line. 
[01:43:00]  And then they go, Susie, or whatever her name was, Susie, did you hear, you know, your boyfriend  and, you know, say he wants to marry you?  Mm-hmm.  And she goes, yeah.  And then Matt Lauer goes, so what do you think?  And now they're all expecting the big, oh, yes, I'll marry him.  Wait, he was there live.  He was there live.  He's proposing.  She's on the phone?  Well, he did it just out of the blue.  Oh, okay.  So then one of the producers from the Today Show obviously said, wow, this is pretty cool.  We'll get her on the phone.  We can make something of this. 
[01:43:30]  Let's, we'll call your girlfriend up, see if she was watching, and we'll get the answer  for you.  How romantic.  So Matt Lauer's got the lady on the phone and asked if she saw, you know, saw the boyfriend  asking her to, you know, marry him.  Uh-huh.  And she goes, yes, I saw that.  Oh.  And then there's just dead silence.  Oh, no.  And then Matt, he doesn't know what to do, so he's like, um, is there anything else you  want to say?  Like, maybe I do?  Um, well, I, I'm on the phone. 
[01:44:00]  Put, put it back in your pants.  Um, yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.  Ow, use more lobe.  So Matt goes, is there anything else you want to say?  And they have the guy, just his face on the screen.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  She does not say I do.  She doesn't say I don't.  She says nothing.  It was so.  Dead silence.  So effing uncomfortable.  And then Matt hinted again, uh, is there anything else you want to say? 
[01:44:30]  And she goes, well, I hope he comes home soon.  No joke.  Ouch.  The guy made a complete fool of himself on national TV this morning.  Oh, that hurts.  So then it was just uncomfortable as you're looking at.  At this tool.  He's going to pull a Dickie Betts on him when he gets home.  Wall smacks.  Oh, you made me look like an idiot on Donald Trump. 
[01:45:00]  Get back here.  Marry me.  Vince Vaughn is in the studio because he's promoting a new movie.  He was so uncomfortable, he goes, dude, man, we're doing a premiere tonight in New York.  Be my guest.  There's going to be plenty of ladies there.  You've got to help a guy out like that that just made a fool of himself on national television.  And then the guy's like, well, can I bring my friend?  The guy was such a freaking fool. 
[01:45:30]  My question is, how do you go back home after that?  Yeah.  How do you face your friends?  Screw going back home.  How do you face your friends?  Dude, you look like you're such a fool, dude.  You dick.  Yeah, that's bad.  You're going to get razzed for the rest of your life.  When you ask that question, you've got to make sure you know what the answer is going to be.  Hey, Bobby, I've got a videotape.  You want to watch?  Look at this idiot.  Professing his love.  Is there anything else you want to say to him?  Watch this one. 
[01:46:00]  Watch.  Watch this one.  Ah!  Ha ha!  You hear that?  Yeah, I hope he comes home soon.  I hope he comes home soon.  What a tool.  That's not I do, my friend.  Oh.  It was pretty damn funny.  So uncomfortable.  And the unshaved Al Roker.  Yeah.  With his cane, I know.  What has he got a cane from?  No, his cripple stick, whatever.  The crutch.  Oh, does it actually have the handcuff on it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the handcuff is the worst crutch of them all.  Yeah, because yesterday on the Today Show, they had to show his knee surgery.  Oh, God.  How come any time on the Today Show, they have a procedure, we have to sit through it 
[01:46:30]  and see it?  Katie Couric's colon.  Remember that?  That was classic.  Who the hell wanted to see that?  That was classic.  Now, I swear to God, people don't realize.  They think, hey, this is going to be an interesting story that will captivate the American psyche  and we'll be able to show.  No.  Now, all I see when I look at Katie Couric is her getting a pipe.  That's all I'm thinking every time I see her now is Katie Couric laying on the table,  taking the pipe. 
[01:47:00]  Taking a lot of the pipe.  She took a lot of the pipe.  She had to.  They got to photograph her colon.  Well, now they got Al Roker.  They showed everything.  Maybe if he didn't.  Completely knocked out and they had to lift his body up to give him the epidural or whatever.  Green piece help.  Into the spine.  They're pretty experienced with rolling over huge mammals.  And now he hasn't shaved in a while because he's been out rehabilitating the knee.  He looks just completely stupid.  He looks like a bear.  He's just a big grizzly bear or something. 
[01:47:30]  I can't put my finger on it.  He looks like something, man.  You know.  A big, a huge Ewok.  God.  Maybe if you didn't weigh a thousand pounds, your knee wouldn't blow out on you.  You know.  It says it's from a car accident 15 years ago, Anthony.  Oh, is that what it is?  And he had reconstructive surgery.  It was supposed to last 10.  And he went another five years.  And now he had to get the procedure done.  Is that the official story?  Yeah.  I think if you didn't weigh a thousand pounds, your knee wouldn't blow out on you.  Did I say that?  And then the other knee, the other knee needs the same thing, Anthony. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, because of a different accident?  But he's going to put that off for as long as he can.  You know what I think, Opie?  No F in life.  Because I do hate the show.  And you could call up Sandy right now.  She'll tell you.  Because I just scream at the TV.  You didn't watch the blonde-haired Regis?  Oh, I did check that out yesterday.  If you want to watch any daytime television, you've got to watch the blonde-haired Regis.  And the blonde-haired.  Summer blonde month.  And blonde-haired Gelman.  Blonde-haired Gelman.  As if Gelman doesn't look homosexual enough. 
[01:48:30]  We put him in blonde hair.  Gelman, you're a flaming fat.  Kelly Ripper's more of a man than you.  I guess they're going for the whole Mike Piazza look.  Yeah.  Regis dyed his hair back.  But now he just looks like an old man with a dye job.  Yeah.  He just screwed up his hair forever.  Forever.  And Gelman still has the blonde hair.  It looks completely ridiculous.  Gelman, it's great.  When his face is buried in the pillow, I think it's a woman.  It looks like that dyke that was with Ellen.  What's her name? 
[01:49:00]  Anne Hayes.  Anne Hayes with the short hair.  And she had the same ass.  That Gelman nine-year-old boy ass.  There he is.  He's celebrating his 70th birthday in the paper today.  Even though his birthday is not until August, Anthony.  Why is he still around?  I don't know.  He probably is.  Come on, he's Irish.  What?  Noah's funny.  And we've talked about this with Regis, Anthony.  Yeah.  Jon Stewart was hosting with him.  Yeah.  Really funny guy.  We love Stewart on this show.  And you know how we discuss how Regis doesn't know anything about his gas. 
[01:49:30]  I have no clue what you do.  He would interview the people from Survivor and have no clue what the show is about.  He does this all the time if you really want to have fun when you watch Regis.  He knows nothing.  My favorite whole thing with Regis knowing nothing was when they brought the computers out.  Yeah.  I think Dale or something was doing a promotion with the Regis Philbin show there.  And they wheeled out these computers that they were going to give away to some room in Texas that could answer a question.  So Regis had to demonstrate the computer. 
[01:50:00]  He couldn't even turn it on.  And then he gets all upset and everyone's laughing at him.  But you can tell he just feels like an idiot.  I don't know where the on button is here.  And I'm supposed to be, what is that, down trolling?  What do you do with it?  Gellman, help me here.  And they're all laughing at him.  I have a floppy watch.  No, I don't ask George.  Hard as a rock, unless I'm drunk.  That's great.  I was in P-Town with my blonde hair by the pizza place.  I couldn't get a guy. 
[01:50:30]  With my blonde hair.  Then I met Marker.  Yeah, I love the callback.  He gave up the balloon knockout.  So this morning...  I have the sausage.  Don't slice it.  What am I, a piggyback?  That old gag.  This morning, he has Jon Stewart.  And I guess the Daily Show and Jon Stewart won a Peabody Award.  Yeah.  So they're talking about that.  And then all of a sudden he goes, you know, that's great.  You know, that show you do, the Daily News.  The Daily News? 
[01:51:00]  Is that the show?  He gets everything wrong.  He always gets things wrong.  And the funniest thing, he's on the goddamn game show where you got to answer questions.  And you're looking at the face of a guy that couldn't answer one of these goddamn questions.  Jon Stewart's a nice guy because I would have just broke out laughing.  And Jon's like, you can tell he's a little uncomfortable because he's like, oh my God, the guy just, you know, he doesn't know the name of the show.  So Jon's like, yeah, I guess I'll just start calling that now.  You're on 60 Minutes.  Is that the show?  What are you on?  We'll check you out.  The Daily News. 
[01:51:30]  On the Daily Planet.  No, it's the Daily Planet.  The Daily Show, you idiot.  So you're Dudley Do-Right.  What was that?  Oh, Gellman, help me.  And then he had Puff Daddy on.  I don't care what he's calling himself.  He's Puff Daddy.  P. Diddy.  I even know that tool.  P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  Well, Puff Daddy, he goes to Puff Daddy parties out in the Hamptons.  How quickly do you lose your street cred when you got Regis going to your Hampton parties?  Oof. 
[01:52:00]  Regis is a gangster now.  P. Diddy, I'm a gangster.  Right.  Gellman, remember, always keep the trap open so I can drop my Glock in there if the heat  start pulling us over.  I'm not going down like Biggie Smalls.  I want armor plating on the side of my door.  And I'm wearing the blonde hair now as a discount.  I'm East Coast, Gellman.  I'm East Coast.  Don't be dissing me if you're West Coast.  Kelly Ripper's my hoe. 
[01:52:30]  I love her.  I'm not getting caught on weapon charges.  Can't you see?  You hypnotize me.  Regis, Regis.  Regis, Regis.  Can't you see?  I'm going back to Cali.  I shot a cop in Oaktown.  Yeah.  He wasn't giving me my props, Gellman. 
[01:53:00]  I command respect.  I'm a gangster.  So Puff Daddy was on, and Puff Daddy's showing a clip.  He's in, I think, the Vince Vaughn movie, Anthony, right?  Yeah.  So Regis is like, let's see the clip of you in action in this movie.  Yeah.  And Puff Daddy's all proud that he's in this movie.  This is the clip they showed.  Almost as bad as the Colleen Haskell clip from The Animal where Colleen was on Regis, 
[01:53:30]  and they showed the clip of her work in The Animal, and it was the back of her head.  Yeah.  It was like nothing.  Right.  You didn't get a clip of her at all.  No.  It was Ben Stiller knocking on Puff Daddy's door because Puff Daddy was shooting black golf  balls, and one went through Ben Stiller's window, their neighbors.  And Ben Stiller's pretty psyched that Puff Daddy's living in the neighborhood, but has  to tell him, look, stop hitting golf balls into my house.  And Ben Stiller, hilarious, just going off for about two minutes. 
[01:54:00]  And Puff Daddy, his whole acting was him taking his shades and just tilting him down as Ben  Stiller's talking.  You're a genius.  And then they come back from the clip, and you can just see Regis and Jon Stewart like,  well, what are you saying?  He didn't do anything.  This is supposed to be him in action.  I still want to go to parties.  Shut up.  Cruising down the street in my 6-4.  Jock of the bitches.  Slap of the horse, Gelman.  You don't expect me to do this, do you? 
[01:54:30]  No, no, no.  We can turn it off.  I'm straight out of Compton. 
[01:55:00]  You are.  I'll bust a cap in your ass.  Call me Reage Diddy.  Reage Diddy.  Reage Diddy, Gelman.  He's too friggin' much, man.  You hang with J-Lo, Regis?  Yes, J-Lo.  I love that, what they call booty.  Booty.  She's got the big booty, Gelman.  There you have that.  I totally forgot where we were going.  That doesn't matter.  We ended up there. 
[01:55:30]  That's what we do.  I like that.  She got booty for days.  Booty for days.  All right, and why don't we take a break?  We're Regis, whoever the hell you are right now.  We got to get Otto and George in here.  Sandy Kane in here.  We got a bunch of lovely ladies ready to play broad bingo.  We'll do all of that next, and the girl with the one leg is on the way, too.  Right.  Still a lot of show to go.  Oh, real funny comedian.  He does our show from time to time.  His name is Frank Caliendo.  We were talking about this the other day, so we found it. 
[01:56:00]  Frank Caliendo.  Frank Hollander.  Caliendo.  Doing some Madden.  Does a great John Madden impression as we go to break.  And on the basic premise of Madden is he tells you things you already know.  He's never given you any new information.  Just sitting there with the fox skadoodle, gone circles on a guy's body part.  He'll tell you things like, if the quarterback, if he throws the ball and the receiver catches it in the end zone,  that right there, that's going to be a touchdown. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  God damn is that Madden.  Nailed it.  Nailed it.  Hey, did you ever hear him, like, Troy Aitman lost his contact lenses a couple of years ago,  and Madden's like, here's a guy who when he puts his contacts in, he can see better.  Anything else?  Nath Trodon is at the end zone.  Here's a guy who when he runs, he goes faster. 
[01:57:00]  Come on, one more thing.  Here's a guy who when he eats a lot, he takes a big dump later.  Madden's so ridiculous, he can drive a guy to drink it, and that explains Pat Sumrall's problem.  But Sumrall's got the great voice, doesn't he?  He's got a wonderful voice.  He doesn't use it.  He just does those phrases.  You know the video game, right?  It's totally relevant or evident in the video.  Here's a guy who, if he practiced more, he used the right word on the first try.  Sumrall's got the great voice, you know?  He can be running, the guy's running down the field, he can paint the picture with the language,  but all he does is then, to the 20, to the 25, there's a flag on the plate. 
[01:57:30]  Hey, if the referee, if he throws a flag and he didn't make a mistake right there,  that's going to be a penalty.  Thanks, John.  Wow.  This is my favorite thing about Madden, though, that he'll do like 35, 40 million different  things and throw them into a sentence, but it doesn't make sense, and nobody's paying 
[01:58:00]  attention because everybody's drunk by that time.  There's a guy, and you see, and then you know one time, and I saw these are the guys that  went sometimes, and then they're, and now you know it, that's why, and now when these  are one thing, you know, there's a, see that, you can't tell, Michael Irvin had a crack  pipe on his sideline, you know that, and you see, there's a place for the helpful  hardware man, and then you see there's a rainbow out today, the way a rainbow  works, you got the sun over here, and then there's a cloud over here, and then the rain  comes down at the end of the rainbow, there's a pot of gold and a leprechaun, and he's 
[01:58:30]  do a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight, and maybe I have some of that  crack, and then Brett Favre, Brett Favre had a dog on his leg, and once a farmer had a  dog, and bingo was his name, oh, I went on to spell that in third grade, you clap, and  then I-N-G-O, the dog was lick him, he's got a rash here, if he wants to get rid of it,  tough acting to an actor, he'll get rid of it.  I guess it didn't even last the whole bit, that's my favorite part.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  Opie and Anthony.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  Right.  Where you can't leave anything alone. 
[01:59:00]  Let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone.  You pick artistic subjects.  Opie and Anthony.  New Jersey Cure.  Yeah, listen up, New Jersey drivers, a lot of insurance companies have low premiums,  you have that first accident, and then they nail you.  Anthony, does this help publicists if they're out east partying?  Only if they're New Jersey drivers.  Oh.  Yes.  Let's say you back into a crowd of people.  With New Jersey Cure, they forgive you your first accident. 
[01:59:30]  As long as you don't kill anyone, right?  If you only had one accident on your record in the last three years, you don't pay through  the roof.  Are you allowed to call people white trash, though?  You could do that, too.  I guess they have no restriction on what you yell out your window before you back into that.  Just wondering.  New Jersey Cure also forgives drivers their first two moving violations.  As long as it was an accident, not on purpose, right?  Right.  Okay.  If you have four points on your license, they rate you like you only had two.  New Jersey Cure, committed to and staying with New Jersey drivers.

[02:00:30]  Clutch.  Careful with that mic.  I love clutch.  It's a great band.  Regis, you love clutch, huh?  I like the clutch.  It's not one of my favorites, though.  Not my forte.  It's in the hip-hop.  You're into the hip-hop.  I like the hip-hop, Gilman.  Well, you're hanging with P. Diddy these days.  He was on your show this morning.  Ice Ice Baby.  You're going gangster on it, huh?  Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  Ice Ice Baby.  Um, Regis?  Yeah.  That's kind of an old hip-hop song.

Can't touch this.  Don't touch it, Gilman.  That's MC Hammer, man.  We got to pray.  We got to pray just to make it today.  Do you know any DMX, or who?  DMX.  Who is that? 
[02:01:30]  Um, I only know the current artists.  Yeah, like what?  I like big butts, and I cannot lie.  That's so old.  I do.  I like the fat-ass hoes.  You like the bleach-blonde hoes with the big butts?  I like them bleach-blonde with the big asses.  Yeah.  That's all right.  And they like me, because I can pay the rent.  I like that.  I got benefits. 
[02:02:00]  Wow, that's a callback from two weeks.  I got the benefits.  Two-week callback.  Nice.  Do you know any M&M?  There's one.  Those I love it.  The green ones.  They make you horny.  No, no.  The artists.  It's candy.  M&M.  Never heard of them.  How about Dr. Dre?  Snoop.  Snoop Dogg and Dogg.  No, I like the new stuff.  A little gin and juice.  I said a hip-hop, a hippie, a hippity-by, hip-hip-hop.  You don't stop rocking.  To the bang-bang boogie set up, Chuck the boogie.  To the river, I'm out of the boogie, the beat. 
[02:02:30]  That was a good song of its day, Reg.  That's a little old girl.  I just heard it last week.  Oh, she's a brick house.  I'm really going old school.  Are you into, like, Little Bow Wow?  Who?  Little Bow Wow.  Never heard of her.  No?  All right.  Want to get Otto and George in here?  We've got to play bra bingo.  These ladies have been on hold for, like, an hour.  Oh, man.  That's right.  Yeah, we've got to do another round of bra bingo.  If you're just tuning in, fine game on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:03:00]  You get a bingo card, a five-by-five bingo card.  The middle square is the free boob square.  And then the rest of the card, you fill in random bra sizes.  Mm-hmm.  And we're going to play with the ladies in a little bit, so get your cards ready.  Don't put all the obvious bra sizes in a row so you win right away.  But if you're with your friends, it's a good game to play as the girls call up the show and give their bra sizes.  Otto and George in the studio.  Gentlemen.  How are you, my niggas?  Oh, that's a good one.  My nigga. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, I've just seen a black guy with a tattoo in the lobby.  He's like, yo, you like my tattoo?  I don't see nothing.  Where is it?  You should have used whiteout, you filthy animal.  Oh, my God.  It's like an Irish guy buying a jockstrap.  What are you going to put in there?  It's a waste of money.  I sugar.  Black eyes with tattoos, that's my new bit.  No, it's steel.  It's good to, hey, it's good water.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  We might have to explain Otto and George to a few cities out there, huh?  You've toured around, though, right?  I just want to give a shout-out to Man Cow.  Die, you arrogant piece of garbage.  Die.  You stink on ice.  You don't like the Man Cow, huh?  I hate that prick.  I hate him, too.  Why, he didn't treat you well when you were on his show, Otto?  Yeah, he stinks.  He stinks.  He's not funny.  Horrible.  Yeah.  You guys are going to kill him.  Kill him in the ratings.  Oh, yeah.  They know it.  We're on in the middle of the night in Chicago.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they really...  We're working on it. 
[02:04:30]  They really get our show in Chicago.  So what?  You'll catch up.  Yeah.  That guy stinks.  So George is the puppet.  George is a puppet, yeah.  Who says all the rude things.  Yeah.  See?  I say a lot of rude things.  That's how he gets away with it.  That's right.  I curse a lot.  That's right.  Use cursing as a crutch.  It's more like a motorized wheelchair.  Dump out.  We're dumping out already, Anthony.  I was reading an article today. 
[02:05:00]  Bob Barker just signed for another six years, and the price is right.  He's already 900 years old.  Yeah.  When is he going to die already?  The first item up for dead was a stagecoach.  They're going to be calling...  He's senile.  They're going to be calling the show.  The price is pretty freaking close.  That's material.  What I love about Otto, it's radio. 
[02:05:30]  He doesn't need to bring in George.  Yeah.  But I don't think you can do it without George on your left, right?  You've got to hang out with a puppet.  You should be like that guy in Castaway talking to the soccer ball.  You should be double dating with a coconut.  You see that movie, Castaway?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was you on the island.  Five years, you should have lit up the joint.  Ten guys would have showed up.  They would have been off the island.  Fire it up, man.  Let's get out of here.  Guys got lead. 
[02:06:00]  That's really all right.  What was that soccer ball's name?  Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to a support group now for people who've seen the movie I-A-I.  What's that?  AI.  AI, right, yeah.  I'm in a support group now for people who want to kill themselves after watching it in  the Jay Moore TV movie of the week.  What is that?  Horrible.  Ugh.  You didn't like Jay Moore's movie?  Did that stink?  Was that called Black River?  Black River was on, what, Fox or something the other night? 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  What was that?  Yeah, it was on after midnight.  Oh, horrible.  To Jay's credit, he called the show and warned us that it was going to be really bad.  A preemptive, it sucked.  Oh, man.  Someone, you know what?  I don't want Jay mad at me for the line I'm about to say, but a bunch of people wrote  in and said that Jay, in that movie, looked like the kid from Mask.  Dennis?  Rocky Dennis?  Rocky Dennis.  Jesus, man.  I know.  That's cold.  Two hours, he's walking around town looking to buy a calling card.  He wants to call up Barry Katz.  What the hell happened here? 
[02:07:00]  Hello?  Filthy Jew?  Why am I in this piece of garbage?  That would be his agent, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Barry Katz.  Yeah.  Hi.  Jay, I got a great movie for you.  Just relax.  It'll be fun.  Just enjoy it.  Be loose, man.  You'll get a check.  Filthy Hook knows Jill's eye.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nah.  See, it's okay, though.  George says all the crap.  It's not Otto.  It's a puppet.  It's a puppet.  How can you get mad at a puppet? 
[02:07:30]  Even though, I mean, we tell the story every time Otto's on the show, it got so rude at  one of his shows once that someone did attack George the Puppet.  Stabbed the puppet.  Stabbed George the Puppet.  Yes, there was a stabbing.  And hit your hand.  I got no insurance, man.  I just got to lay there until I feel better.  No insurance for comedians.  Been too long, Otto.  Yeah.  I'd like to do a quick impression.  Paul of Poundstone.  Okay.  Your Honor, I'd like a pop. 
[02:08:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Paul, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm a fat hack.  I lick snatch and I die.  No, no, no, no, no.  We're out of dump.  Hold on.  Wow.  Hold on.  We ran out of dump.  And we were doing so well, Otto.  We were doing so well.  Holy Jesus.  What did he say?  Yeah, it was bad.  It was really bad that all that stone material might not fly on the radio show. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, it's really funny.  Yeah, now they're blaming it on her drinking problem.  Yeah.  Saying that she drinks a little bit and might have done a couple of things under the influence.  That's an excuse.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did he dump out?  Yeah, we dumped out.  Now we really don't have any dump left.  We don't have much dump left in our show.  Look at, everyone's running in saying, stop him, stop him now, please.  We got no dump left. 
[02:09:00]  We're in seven cities.  This is bad.  Suddenly, I'm not half the man.  George Harrison's dying, I heard.  I hear he's got brain cancer.  Oh, that's a bad illness.  They were saying, though, it's under control for now.  It's under control?  Brain cancer?  Oh, man.  Fire up the bong.  He's dead.  Jeez, that's sad. 
[02:09:30]  What else is going on?  How is that?  I'm hesitant to bring up a subject.  Yeah, don't curse.  We're back to normal.  Don't curse.  We're almost back to normal?  Yeah.  Not yet?  We're getting there slowly.  Hey, why don't we bring Sandy Cade in?  Have you met Sandy Cade?  No, I haven't.  Oh, my God.  No, I haven't.  She's a, we don't even know how old she is.  She's got to be 70.  Really?  70?  70.  Ex-Vaudeville.  I'm talking about that. 
[02:10:00]  She just blurts out sound.  She spends time in peep shows to this day.  She walks around with a device.  Hey, what the hell is Aide Fagoda doing in here?  Sandy Cade.  Hey, you filthy animal.  Hey, they're talking about you, dildo.  Aide Fagoda.  Okay, I got my own here.  I got my own.  I know.  I saw a show.  Oh, my God.  Right here.  She walks around with her friend.  Dildo.  Mr. Dildo, yeah.  I need a...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  A D.  A D.  Yeah.  A P, a C.  Hey, George, don't hold back. 
[02:10:30]  What do you think of the lovely Sandy Cade?  Welcome to the show, Sandy Cade.  Can I pick...  Hop on the counter.  We're going to burn your meat curtains with a hot crack pipe.  I'm going to be in show business, right?  How are you?  Oh, you're disgusting.  I'm glad I have you with me.  So what empty refrigerator box did you crawl out of today?  You skank in a fright wig.  Like a house on Haunted Hill looking whore.  God, are you a skank? 
[02:11:00]  Meat curtains, hot crack pipe.  Yeah, she wore the wig today, George.  Oh, my God.  What the hell is Aide Fagoda doing in here?  Hey, wait, you know what?  It might be worth it.  Oh, Jesus.  Sandy, can you show George the growth?  Show George.  Show George.  He's heterosexual, George.  Yeah, show George the growth.  Ian from New York Magazine.  Move over so Sandy Cade can grab that microphone.  You want to explain the growth, Anthony? 
[02:11:30]  Because we do have a couple new markets.  New cities, new cities, new cities.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  She has this thing growing on the, let's just call it the area.  The area.  You know, there's something growing there.  We think it's genital warts, but we're not sure what it is.  But it's growing there.  It looks like the ear that they grew on the back of that lab rat, that lab mic.  Get the fives away from me.  Go one more mic over.  All right, all right.  Sandy, would you like to show George the growth? 
[02:12:00]  We've all seen it.  Would you like to see it, George?  Yes, you filthy bag lady looking whore.  Whatever it takes for a career.  Okay, here it is.  Burn your neat curtains with a curling iron.  Here's my V.  Look at this.  Look at that thing.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, what is that?  Killer in there here.  Oh, is that horrible?  You think I should have an operation, maybe?  Take it off?  Think maybe then I could get a man?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Walton's is making a big comeback.  Could you please cover it back up? 
[02:12:30]  Cover it up.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  You know what we call it?  You ever see the movie Total Recall?  Yeah.  You know that little thing that was growing out of that guy?  Called Quato.  We call that Twato.  Oh, God.  It's the conjoined twin that's just growing out of her.  Oh, God.  I must talk to Twato.  Oh, my God.  I need to see a priest and visit a vomitorium.  Horrible-looking person you are.  Okay.  What about those fun bags?  Don't you like people for the... 
[02:13:00]  I mean, I'm a nice person.  You're a nice person?  Yeah, I go to church on Sundays.  You're a mentally ill-filty bag lady.  Well, I don't have a bag.  You don't have a bag?  I have a vibrator.  I don't have a bag here, but that's about it.  Your vibrator's going to go gay.  It's disgusting.  Well, bend over, George.  You had it customized, man.  Be the first.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You're triple X.  You're triple X.  That's the way.  All right, hold on, though.  I was thrown out of that.  I was thrown out of John P.A., so...  Sandy, explain to Otto and George the teeth. 
[02:13:30]  Do I have to?  She's very sensitive about her teeth.  Yeah, hey, what teeth?  Well, you told everyone.  Yeah, I know, but, you know, it's like, you know, it's a tragedy.  Do you have a tissue?  What?  Tissue.  I don't even know you.  Oh, man.  Tissue, man.  You should be Cain and C4.  You should be Cain and C4.  That's why my name is Cain.  But, yeah, it's...  All right, listen.  What do you do exactly?  How do you get money? 
[02:14:00]  That's a good question, man.  Well, you know...  She works the peep shows.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, there was a guy on my balcony, the balcony where I live, and he was looking in at me today,  and I'm wondering what I should do about that.  He was, like, looking on the balcony, and I was totally nude.  It's a cop.  He thought it was a crime scene.  No, and then he followed me down the elevator and out the door.  So I just had to air that.  So you don't want to talk about the teeth again?  About the dentist and the thing he did to you?  Well, no.  I just...  I had this dentist, and he just... 
[02:14:30]  It was a boyfriend.  That's me.  Boyfriend.  That was a lover?  Lover.  I thought that's why...  I was that bad in bed that he did that.  Well, why would he do it, then?  I thought you guys had a little romance going on.  Oh, no.  He was just a dentist I knew for a long time, and he had a partner, and she's like, it's a  long...  Can I show you my V again?  No.  No, no.  No.  Listen, I've had a very tragic life, so...  All right, I'm going to explain to you.  Run the x-ray without the bib on this...  Oh, my God.  Die.  Die by the third rail. 
[02:15:00]  Die by the third rail.  Why do you say I'm a whore?  Look what you do to get on radio.  I think...  You can't say that.  Yeah, you can't say that.  Nice.  No cursing.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't be cursing all the time.  Can I just make one announcement, though?  Sure.  It's very important, because I'm on public access television, so I can do whatever I want  or say anything I want or show anything.  So sometimes it's hard to...  I just did a show.  I can say anything I want.  Gorgeous. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  I love you guys.  I love you guys.  So it's hard to...  Yeah, just because you're so good looking, you know, and you're lucky, you know, you should...  So anyway, my show, Manhattan, Manhattan, is changing from...  So you guys want to play Broad Bingo?  Yeah, let's get a game going.  Broad Bingo.  This is tragic.  No, I'm on public access.  Just tragic.  I'm on Saturday nights from now on.  You know what?  I'm inviting these two on.  Otto and George?  Yes.  Because I think they're hysterical.  Why isn't George looking at you anymore? 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  I'm not easy to take, huh?  I don't know.  I'd rather drink AIDS out of a cooler.  Well, maybe I'll do this show in the dark.  Yeah, and maybe you should off yourself from a high building.  Slatter yourself in front of the hard rock.  That'd be good for radio, too, wouldn't it, Nack?  Good exposure, huh?  Yeah.  Slatter yourself.  Sandy is looking at the puppet and getting really pissed.  Yeah, just he's my type. 
[02:16:30]  I like short guys.  Why am I a magnet?  I like short guys.  Just like this one.  All right.  What are you doing later?  Let's escape blood tests.  I had a baby do-da, do-da.  I like him.  I like George.  He's my type.  Thank you, Chris.  He's got a woody.  Why do you put on makeup in the morning?  Why do I do that?  Why?  It doesn't work?  It doesn't help?  No, I'm just saying why.  Why?  Do I look better without makeup?  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just saying why do you put makeup on in the morning?  Because I try to look better. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, okay.  And I try to be Sandy Kane.  You are Sandy Kane.  Right.  No, not without makeup.  Oh, you're not?  And earrings and this bra.  I have a show on public accents if being switched to Saturday.  I also have an Etch-A-Sketch with one knob.  I can only do circles.  Whore with no future.  George is hilarious.  Be nice to her.  Otto, you're okay, too. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, thank you.  All right.  What do you think of those fun bags, though?  Good luck in your chosen career.  I'd like to kill you with a snow shovel.  That'd be good radio.  Strangler and killer.  Hey, George, have you been breastfed?  Yeah, with doorknobs.  Here, show George your boobs there, Sandy.  Maybe that'll turn them around.  I've seen enough.  70-year-old boobs.  I've seen enough.  70-year-old boobs.  Here they go.  Look at those things.  70-year-old.  How old are you, Sandy?  How old are you?  Can you keep a secret?  Yeah.  Well, that's mine.  I know. 
[02:18:00]  You say that every time you're on your show.  70 years old.  Oh, God.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  I cast you out on clean steering.  The power of Christ compels you.  He loves me, Jesus.  He loves me.  Yeah, Jesus is very open-minded.  Hey, scene one, scene of both.  Hey, George, would you like to see...  By the way, I talk to Jesus.  He hates your guts.  And you're too crazy about Norris, either. 
[02:18:30]  George?  Yeah.  Would you like to see Sandy Kane's hemorrhoid?  Oh, no.  Why do you hate me?  Yeah, just I ate Mexican food for the show.  What did I ever do for you?  I just gave him Taco Bell.  You gave him Taco Bell?  Yeah.  I just gave him...  Would you like to see my hemorrhoid, George?  Yeah, you gotta...  I don't want to see no more.  Just don't get close.  Just give a long range...  No, you can't.  I'm gonna yank my word.  Sandy, you gotta move a little more that way.  All right, hold on.  We're dumping out like crazy.  But you guys...  Sorry, I'm sorry.  You guys gotta check this out.  Being honest.  You're part of the gang, and we've all seen this, George. 
[02:19:00]  The hemorrhoids?  And Otto, yeah.  Yeah, you gotta see the hemorrhoid.  The hemorrhoid hemorrhoid.  We think it's...  We think it's...  I could always get it a long...  Well, next July.  All right, George.  Look at this.  Disgusting.  All right, would you like to see it, George?  Yeah, but then again, I like bust fumes.  All right, let's see the hemorrhoids.  Okay, all right.  Get the...  Look.  Let's see.  I cast you out, unclean staring!  Okay.  Is that awful? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, God.  What is going on back there?  What, can you see it?  We saw everything.  It's popping out, saying hello.  Oh, it's like a jack-in-the-box.  Well, it needs exposure, you know?  I mean, you know, I think rear ends are very unexposed.  No one looks like...  Um, George, what'd you think of that hemorrhoid?  Not too good.  Not good at all.  Not good.  It was as big as George's head.  Not good.  Actually, compared to the Jay Moore TV movie, The Wick, that was pretty interesting. 
[02:20:00]  Staring to the old whore's starfish.  Thank you.  Hey, you'll never...  And I gotta pay for my own parking.  Otto, you'll never forget our showdown.  Oh, God.  You don't see that every day, Otto.  Awful.  Thanks for not washing your one piece, whatever that is.  It's not clean back there?  You were a...  No, there was like...  I wiped.  Something going on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's what I wiped.  It looked like, uh... 
[02:20:30]  I don't know.  You ever see right where the planes hit the runway at Kennedy?  It's where all the rubber rubs off.  It's what it looked like.  You had those skid marks going on.  But that's on flesh.  Uh-huh.  What the hell's going on back there?  What is your nature now, folks?  You're not nuts.  Didn't mommy and daddy give you enough love that you were a child?  No.  I guess not.  Anyway.  But no, as long as I wiped, there's nothing brown back there.  Oh, God.  Oh! 
[02:21:00]  Cut it out.  I'm sorry.  It's true.  All right.  I would be very embarrassed.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Sandy, so why are you here today?  I was going to sing the Jerry Seinfeld song.  Okay.  You have a Jerry Seinfeld song.  Yes.  Is there music to this?  Yes.  All right.  Do we have music?  Yes.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Steve says he needs a couple minutes to get the music.  So Sandy can sing to it.  Great.  And we'll play bra bingo.  So ladies, if you're on hold, stay there.  Otto and George, you want to play a little round of bra bingo with the fine, lovely ladies  on the show? 
[02:21:30]  Brown bingo.  Brown bingo.  No, not brown bingo.  Bra bingo.  Did I say brown?  No, she said brown.  I'll never be the same.  That's much frightening.  Otto almost dropped the puck when he saw that.  I need to see a rabbi.  Rabbi.  Oh, God.  We'll be back with the Sandy Kane song, Anthony.  Great.  The Jerry Seinfeld song from Sandy Kane.  In just a bit.  As we go to the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  A big FU goes after the city of Boston, you know.

So, we had to take a break because Sandy Kane had to get ready.  She wants to sing her Jerry Seinfeld song, Anthony.  We got her music ready, and I don't know why she's... 
[02:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Horrible.  Horrible.  What a...  Ugh.  Yeah, I just want to get it, like, a little more stimulated.  Ugh.  Sandy.  Yeah, I like the 20 in your little G-string there.  Yeah, so I gave it to me.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  It's fake.  Yeah, and Wolverines are good house pets.  That's great.  Sandy.  The feather boa she's got on, and she...  Ugh.  Sandy, move over to your left.  Horrible.  They've got to see what you're wearing.  Not too far.  Oof. 
[02:26:00]  And she's got...  Did you do my fly band?  Ah.  No, no.  Ah.  No.  Oh, my God.  Man, I can't take much more.  Just when you thought there wasn't another horrific sight on the body, we get to see another one.  I am so horny.  I am so horny.  Are you?  Yeah.  Well, good luck.  Yeah.  You know what's a good orgasm?  Suicide.  Splatter yourself from the Chrysler building.  I was going to commit suicide, but my mother would kill me. 
[02:26:30]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Come on.  Barney Miller's in reruns.  You're not getting no money.  It's time to kill yourself.  You're right.  Really, seriously.  If I kill myself, you'll be the one...  Best orgasm.  Suicide.  You'll have my blood on your hands.  Splatter your filthy body.  George, you're getting confused.  That's not fish with a wig.  Oh, it's not?  No, it's any fish.  No, that's a...  Do I smell?  Tommy, can you get me off the hook?  For old times' sake.  The meat curtain will be taped behind the toilet. 
[02:27:00]  It's perfect for us.  It's got the old toilet with the pull chain.  Yeah.  How did that guy know what the toilet looked like?  What, did he take a leak in every John in the five boroughs?  Who is in the Bronx?  It's Tarthik.  What are you?  This guy goes a lot.  Okay.  Anyway.  So, sing your little song, and then in the back of the head, put a snow shovel.  You know what happened?  I had the O&A song that I sang on my own show. 
[02:27:30]  I wrote a song for you.  This is fascinating.  O.P.  And Anthony's song.  Yeah.  And then last night, truth, I swear to God, I had a wet dream about Jerry Seinfeld.  So, it made me feel that that's the song I should sing.  All right.  So, yeah.  Stop dancing around and sing already, you crit keeper.  Truth.  Sing already.  Sing or die.  Sing or die.  Sing or die.  Jerry Seinfeld.  I had a wet dream about him.  All right.  Anyway, that's...  All right.  We'll see if this makes the radio.  Waiting for the music.  Sandy Kane.  Yeah, it's very clean. 
[02:28:00]  And her Jerry Seinfeld.  Disgusting.  Wet dream wasn't.  Really?  She's very well endowed.  Oh, no.  Take those away from her.  You're not allowed.  You don't need those when you sing.  Stop bringing the vibrator in here.  Take...  We got special headphones.  They go back into the acid zone.  That is funny.  I didn't know we did that.  When Sandy Kane comes in here, she's got her own special headphones.  How much is it to steam clean a console, anyway?  Can you say erection?  Disgusting.  No.  Don't say. 
[02:28:30]  Don't say.  You just...  It's okay.  Just have one.  You can say it.  Just don't put it in any context.  All right.  Don't talk about it, please.  I'm sorry.  All right.  What...  It's been a tough...  It's been a tough life.  All right.  I'm going to start your music, okay?  Sandy, shut up!  Shut your filthy hole, you scum!  Just be quiet and sing your...  Well, I mean...  Sing your song.  You like me for my hemorrhoids.  Shut up!  You too.  I didn't have a hemorrhoid.  Shut up!  Yeah.  Oof.  I didn't have a hemorrhoid. 
[02:29:00]  Thank God.  Shut the F up, please.  Freaking panties.  Ooh.  Tell Mike I always liked them.  I can't hang my hat in Brooklyn.  I thought I was going to go totally naked here.  You know what?  I want to see if she can do something, okay?  I thought I was going to do something naked here.  Sandy.  What?  I want to see if you can shut up for 20 seconds, okay?  Going to give her 20 seconds?  Starting now. 
[02:29:30]  We can't let the alarm go off.  Oh, that's right.  The dead air alarm.  So we'll...  We'll say something.  You said something.  I knew she couldn't do it.  She couldn't.  She talked.  She was like,  I got up for 20 seconds.  She just made a noise.  I got up for 20 seconds.  All right.  I'm just going to sing this naked,  but I guess I won't.  No, that's okay.  No?  You don't think so?  I don't know.  You couldn't take it, you guys?  No.  Take it?  Is that throw up on your bra  or is that supposed to be there?  Where?  I don't know.  I like the design. 
[02:30:00]  Is that throw up or is that part of...  It's a flower.  That cross around your neck  doesn't burn right through your chest?  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.  I smell vermin, Poon Chang.  Anyway.  All right.  Sandy, I'm going to start your music, okay?  Okay, baby.  Another current song.  There she goes.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby. 
[02:30:30]  Jerry, baby.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Whoa.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What are you...  Don't talk.  Don't say anything like,  can't you say blah, blah, blah.  Don't...  Hey.  Shut up.  Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  You can't say that.  You can't say the...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Holy...  F!  Sandy.  Shut up. 
[02:31:00]  Don't...  You can't...  Shut up!  All right, look.  I agree, then.  I want to punch you in the face.  Kill her.  Kill her, Anthony.  Listen to me.  Why can't you shut your effing trap?  How come when I'm saying you can't say something,  you then say that word?  Don't say it.  Shut up!  Don't say anything.  That...  Now, don't say it.  The C word you said can't be said.  Don't say it!  I see you gearing up to say it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What did you throw at her? 
[02:31:30]  What was that?  Of course.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  That was a near one.  That's your...  Sandy.  That's your Jerry Seinfeld music.  You can't say.  Oh, that was her music?  Wow.  Nice rage.  That was beautiful.  Wow.  You got some kind of disorder.  No.  That's for sure.  That's...  She dresses up to it.  No, but the lyrics are,  Come out tonight.  Yeah, I know,  but you didn't say,  Come out tonight.  Now, Shut up.  Hey. 
[02:32:00]  You used the other version of that word,  and you put it in a context...  Can I do it again?  Can I do it that way?  Don't you want it on the air?  Yeah, I do.  No, but I mean, I'll do it...  Look, I don't...  You guys got me so horny  that I had to do it that way.  I am so horny  that I had to say it that way.  Well, okay, look.  Look.  Can I just do it one more time?  Let's do it back up.  Let's play a game.  If we have to dump out of you  one more time in the show,  we get to throw stuff at you.  I always like them. 
[02:32:30]  Everyone pick up something  you're going to throw at Sandy  if she gets dumped out of again.  Right.  This is what we do.  This is what we do now.  See, this is what we do now to you.  Can I do this topless?  We do now to you this now.  I got to do topless.  All right.  I can't help it, man.  She's got innings.  You see that?  What happened to those things?  Any...  What happened?  They never came out.  They never came out.  They never developed.  Yeah.  I'm still waiting.  Is that the suction that happened  when your uterus fell out?  It just pulled everything in? 
[02:33:00]  I don't know what happened to me.  Is that what happened?  It's been a tough life.  They never developed.  They never came out.  Sandy, there's a handsome can driver  by Central Park.  He's got a family at Porris.  He needs you to trot him through the park.  Now I can sing.  Now I can sing.  All right.  Is it all queued up yet?  Yeah.  We're going to do it again.  Let's try.  Now, look.  Here's the game.  I'm going to throw a scissor.  I have a half full bottle of Coke.  Ben's got a videotape. 
[02:33:30]  Otto, George.  Yeah.  Violent show.  Do you have a CD or something?  I don't want to.  Violent show.  No, you want to hurt him.  Empty bottle.  I can't hang my fun bags in Brooklyn.  All right.  We're going to try the song again, Sandy.  Okay?  Violent people.  Ooh.  All right.  Who wants to throw the Magic 8 ball?  I'll do it.  Shoot.  All right.  Here we go.  Give me something hot.  Moderate to heavy.  Moderate to heavy.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't get dumped at them.  Watch those words. 
[02:34:00]  Here she goes.  Jerry Seinfeld song.  Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Throw it now.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you come out tonight?  All right.  Jerry, baby.  Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Baby.  Come out tonight.  Come.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you come out tonight? 
[02:34:30]  Jerry, baby.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Why don't you come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, you can bring Opie and Anthony, too.  Bring Otto and bring George, too.  And you can ring Rick Delgado.  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  Jerry. 
[02:35:00]  Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Oh, screw it.  Just throw a thing down her anyway.  Come out tonight.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  He's got it hard.  Come, Jerry, baby.  Does he think better anyway?  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld. 
[02:35:30]  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Well, then, you can bring Jerry Seinfeld.  You can bring Jerry.  You can bring Jerry.  Lois, that's yours.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, and you can bring Jerry Springer.  That's yours.  Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld. 
[02:36:00]  Why don't you come out tonight?  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Bring Jerry Seinfeld.  Bring Jerry Seinfeld.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Bring Opie and Anthony, too.  Bring Jerry Seinfeld.  Wow.  She's durable.  Yeah, you're throwing stuff at a chick that's probably used to taking right hooks. 
[02:36:30]  42nd and 8th I worked for 10 years.  Wow.  So you're used to things being thrown at you?  42nd and 8th.  And comedy clubs.  Oh, my God.  How close did the scissors come?  Not close enough.  We survived the Opie and Anthony show.  Steve saw the one shot.  I heaved the wiffle ball bat and hit her right in the face.  I threw Ben.  I'm into S&M.  I threw Ben's ice coffee all over the front. 
[02:37:00]  I'm into S&M, man.  I love it.  Whip me.  Whip me.  By me, bring me.  Whip me.  I love it.  Wow.  Boy, well, you could take it.  That's for sure.  Yeah, that's for sure.  And I must say, I don't think we dumped out of your song.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Sandy Cain, everyone.  I think we've got to take a break.  And we're going to finish the show finally with a round of bra bingo, Anthony.  Yeah.  Girls have been waiting long enough.  All right.  We broke stuff in here today. 
[02:37:30]  Hello.  Bye.  I think you're getting broken.  Yeah.  Can I just say my show is on Saturday?  Shut up.  Saturday night's now 11.  Oh, that had hurt.  Channel 56 on Manhattan Ava Network.  Yay.  Yay.  We're having you all on.  Yay.  All right.  Why don't we play Brother Joe's Sandy Cain song as we go to break?  All right.  And we'll play bra bingo next, Anthony.  Brother Joe playing bar nine tonight.  That is right.  Everybody already knows. 
[02:38:00]  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Here's the Sandy Cain song.  We'll be back with Otto and George, Sandy Cain, Brother Joe, and bra bingo.  No, that's not it, man.  I want to play Brother Joe's song.  James.  I think that was the James Taylor one.  Here, give me that.  James!  Give me that.  Here, give me that.  God damn, that was funny.  Jerry checking and saying,  Where was J.P. Morgan to gong her? 
[02:38:30]  Joe, I think that was our own version of the gong joke.  Look on the floor, because I think your song's somewhere on the floor.  Did you throw Joe's song at Sandy Cain?  I think we threw it.  Sometimes sacrifices have to be made.  Oh, wow.  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  Awful.  All right, we found it.  It was under Steve C.'s feet.  The Sandy Cain song.  Here it is.  Oh, ow. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, ow.  Known as Sandy Cain.  When she strips.  Ow.  She falls to stomach pain.  She is covered.  Oh, ow.  With very close veins.  She has money rewards.  I'm afraid.  Well, you'll hurl.  Oh.  When her pants come down.  Who's a patch?  Oh.  It's crusty red and brown.  And a screw.  Oh, ow.  Like Bozo the clown.  Yes, she loves her hammer or rocks. 
[02:39:30]  You're disgusting.  He's standing.  You make eyes hurl.  You make eyes hurl.  When they look at your B.D.  You make eyes hurl.  You're just a wrinkled old lady with no teeth.  Sandy.  Ah.  Has vibrating tones.  Babbles in coherent noise.  She chases.  Oh.  Away all the boys and the girls and cats and dogs. 
[02:40:00]  I'm afraid.  One day, some retarded run.  He went down south of Denny's stone.  He started kissing Sandy's bun.  Oh.  And it's wide open his nose.  You're nauseating.  Hey, Sandy.  You make eyes hurl.  You make eyes hurl.  When they look at your B.D.  You make eyes hurl.  You ugly, sappy old hoes back.  You're a brave. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes, Sandy used to strip in bars until they told her to stop that night, dear.  She would take off all her friggin' get clothes.  The customer's going blind, yeah.  But she had always made a few extra buns with her mouth and hands.  Oh.  Oh.  Sandy and her rancid beauty clan.  Oh. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio.

[02:42:30]  We are back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  8-7-7-6-9-2-1-0-2-7.  Not much time left.  Yeah, we got bad news.  We're not going to be able to play another round of Broad Bingo today.  So someone please remind me tomorrow, or remind us tomorrow.  Oh, we'll play it.  But, I mean, come on.  We had Otto and George in here.  The Sandy Cain thing.  We got to throw stuff at Sandy Cain.  That stuff was hilarious.  I think the girl with Missing a Foot showed up. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, another reason why we can't play Broad Bingo,  because the cute girl with one leg is here.  Oh, okay.  Well, we don't have much time.  We only have, like, five minutes left in the show.  Bring her in quickly.  Yeah, let's bring Emma in.  She's going to be part of Cripple Bouts.  Jeez.  Let's see.  Are you serious?  Does she limp?  Does she limp?  Does she walk okay?  Let me see.  Hey.  Oh, wait.  You're walking kind of funny.  Not really.  I am not.  I can do a jig if you want to.  Well, get Earl in here.  Hey, Emma, you are hot.  Yeah, I told you I was.  What do you think of, Ryan? 
[02:43:30]  You're the one that lost your leg below the knee in the car accident, right?  Yes.  That's Otto and George.  Hi, Otto.  Hi, George.  Hello.  Hi.  George's a puppet.  What's wrong?  I didn't realize that George was a puppet when I was listening to the radio.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm a puppet.  I see.  I see you watch.  He's a puppet, but he's real.  Well, you'll see.  You'll start staring at him if you're staying here long enough.  No, I got to see the foot.  Yeah.  Okay.  I brought in my spare one, and it doesn't have a foot on it because I was moving stuff 
[02:44:00]  into my apartment, and the foot flew off while I was walking up the stairs.  It was pretty funny until I realized I couldn't walk.  Oh, you got one of those cool fake feet.  The little spring pad thing.  Yeah.  The spring pad thing.  Yeah.  The spring pad thing.  No, there used to be a foot.  For the Nike commercial.  Yeah, exactly, except there used to be a foot on the bottom of this.  Oh, you don't have the one with the foot, though, and the painted toenails?  No, I'm wearing that one.  Oh, let me see.  All right.  Come over here and put your leg up on the console near Anthony and Otto and George.  Let's see.  Okay, okay.  Hold on.  We could have used the one with the hook on it when Sandy was singing.  Thrown it at her.  I was going to throw it at her.  I was so excited. 
[02:44:30]  I was late.  To throw your leg at her would have been great.  And Emma, how old are you?  Like 20?  20.  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Holy crap.  Look, it's like a real leg.  That is a real leg.  Only it's not.  What about the, let me see the toes.  There's no toes?  I thought you painted the big toes and stuff.  I was on that.  There used to be toes on that one, but then the foot flew off, so this one, it just looks  like I have no, you'll see it.  It looks like a foot with no toes?  Yeah.  You seem all right with this.  Oh, I'm very, very all right with it.  Yeah, I think it's a lot.  She can move around like no problem. 
[02:45:00]  Look, it looks like a real foot in the sock, and then, whoa.  No toes.  Cool.  Wait, wait, lift it up.  Lift it up.  Oh, my God.  That's a Barbie foot.  She got a Barbie foot.  She got a Barbie foot.  Whoa, she just took it off.  She took it off.  She could take the foot off.  How does that stay on?  Suction, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The pin.  Suction.  The sock.  Look at that.  Yeah, she's got like a whole pin thing going on there.  You have your knee.  I have my knee.  Thank God for that, huh?  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, definitely.  Is this an alcohol-related crash?  No.  No?  Jesus.  This was my best friend playing chicken in the rain at 11 o'clock.  All right.  She was playing chicken?  He was.  He was?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Did he lose or what?  I mean, let me...  Yeah, he definitely lost.  What's wrong with him?  Nothing.  That's why he didn't lose then.  Yeah, basically.  That's why I got a fat $15,000 like sitting on the table right now.  How much money did you get in the lawsuit? 
[02:46:00]  My insurance company sued his insurance company, so it wasn't actually...  So I got about $200,000.  Hey, tiger in Africa?  Yeah, George.  The tiger in Africa.  So are you going to be part of Cripple Bouts?  I don't know.  I'm kind of debating it.  Yeah?  I mean, I could kick some ass, but I think I'll probably be the only one-legged girl up there, so...  Well, we can get another one-legged girl.  Another one-legged girl?  Yeah.  Then we'll figure out what you guys could do.  Okay.  Definitely.  If you can find another girl, definitely do it. 
[02:46:30]  When you go out with guys, you let that out of the bag right away?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah?  I'm not going to, like, be in bed with somebody.  Like, hey, can I buy you a drink?  Okay, but I have one leg.  Is that, like, right away?  No, I'm...  It doesn't seem like it affects her at all, though.  It doesn't affect me at all.  Like, I don't even notice it, like, 90% of the time, but then, you know, if I'm going  to be in bed with somebody, I'm definitely going to tell them beforehand.  Better say something.  Sure.  Yeah.  I've had some incidents.  Have you ever stabbed the fake leg in front of people just to freak them out?  That'd be cool.  I'll put a staple in my leg. 
[02:47:00]  Watch.  I got in a fight with a guy at a bar in Alphabet City a couple weeks ago, and I took my leg off  and was about to hit him over the head with it, but my friends kind of stopped me.  Why did that happen?  He's got a weapon with him.  Nice.  You could kick someone in the face.  You don't even have to do anything.  I like to tell him.  She's feisty.  What kind of situations did you say you were in?  I was, like, sleeping with someone, and my leg fell off.  That was kind of a bad one.  Wow.  And he didn't know?  No, he knew, but it was just weird, like, you know, whatever.  We're humping, and all of a sudden, my leg flies off. 
[02:47:30]  Wow, I'm good.  Appendages fly off the chicks when I nail them.  Whoa.  During sex, the leg flies off.  Every once in a while.  I haven't heard that one before.  That's a new one.  Brand new.  Deuce Bigelow, you know.  Yeah.  I get the Deuce Bigelow jokes all the time.  Hey, you saw that?  Yeah.  I can't be involved with the Deuce Bigelow jokes, because I haven't seen it.  How about one-legged twister?  Oh, you could win on that, too.  Oh, yeah.  Because, you know, what, right foot green, you just pop it off and lean over on it. 
[02:48:00]  You can play two boards at once.  I've never played with my, oh, yeah, I've never played with my leg off, but I should definitely  try it.  All right.  That sucks.  That sucks.  I know.  Very end of the show now.  We've got to get out of here, like, right now.  We're going to continue with Emma in New York for a little while.  Otto, real fast plug, because we've got to leave our...  The Groove in Lyndhurst will be burning Sandy Cane with hot crack pipes a week from Thursday  in Lyndhurst.  And the brokerage tomorrow night.  The brokerage tomorrow night.  And most important, Jenkinson's Monday in Point Pleasant. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  All you animals come down.  It's a great drinking bar.  All right.  Next to the Tiki Bar.  You know where it is.  Right on.  Otto and George, it's always a pleasure.  We're going to continue with Emma in just a bit, and to everyone else out there, we've got  to leave.  Sorry.  Love you, ONA.  Thank you, Otto.  And we will see you tomorrow.  We'll see most of the cities tomorrow, and we'll continue with New York next.  You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now, please.  Both me and Anthony show.  Thank you. 
[02:49:00]  Man, we've got to continue with Emma for a minute here.  Emma was telling us during the commercials that, well, I asked her, I go, all kidding  aside, when you had your accident and realized you lost your leg, were you traumatized at any  point?  And she has a really good story to tell.  Emma, just say what you just said.  It wasn't just the leg.  You were pretty bad.  Well, I broke pretty much all the bones in my left leg, all the bones in my right leg,  punctured my liver, punctured my lung, broke my collarbone.  Ow.  And I died, and I came back to life, but I didn't, they put me under so much morphine 
[02:49:30]  that I didn't know what was going on for two weeks, so I just woke up after two weeks,  had no idea what had happened, and I just, like, didn't know.  Like, hey, what happened?  Well, that was some party.  Yeah, exactly.  I had no idea, like, nothing.  So they do, like, we have some good news and some bad news.  The good news, you were dead, but we were able to bring you back to life.  Then what's the bad news?  Well, you're missing a leg.  The weirdest thing about it, actually, was that apparently when they rolled me into  the hospital, and I don't remember this, I asked the doctor if I was going to be able  to walk, and he said, yeah. 
[02:50:00]  And then I asked him if I was going to have a leg, and he said no.  So when I actually woke up in the hospital, I didn't remember anything that had happened,  but I already knew that I didn't have a leg.  Oh, you remember that?  Yeah.  I didn't, I don't remember saying that or anything, but I just knew that I didn't  have a leg.  Yeah.  Now, when you were dead, anything?  I know.  I got completely dipped out of my near-death experience.  No tunnel, no white light.  You got the discount store version of the death experience.  Exactly.  No white light, no grandma, no walk.  Nothing.  Toward the light, Carolina.  Nothing like that.  Jesus was not there.  No Jesus, no nothing.
