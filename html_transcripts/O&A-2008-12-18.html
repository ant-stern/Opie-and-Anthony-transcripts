<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the hosts' surprisingly active Saturday morning bowel movements, transitioning into a critique of the movie "Milk," focusing on Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk and the perceived awkwardness of the same-sex kissing scenes.  This led to a broader discussion on actors who've poorly played gay characters, with names like Al Pacino, Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, James Franco, and Robert Downey Jr. being thrown around, accompanied by descriptions of specific scenes and the actors’ apparent discomfort.

The conversation then sharply shifted to the not-guilty verdict in the Robert Ellis case, a New York police killing, sparking outrage at the perceived leniency towards white-collar criminals versus those involved in street crime.  Bernie Madoff's lenient bail conditions further fueled this anger, prompting a discussion on the death penalty in New York and its infrequent use.  Listener calls contributed examples of crimes seemingly deserving of the death penalty, continuing the discussion on justice system inconsistencies. The segment concluded with a brief, contrasting discussion of The Doors and Amy Winehouse, their musical merits (or lack thereof), and the public fascination with celebrity downfall, before returning to music before the show’s closing.

The next segment began with a discussion of musical preferences, specifically the hosts' disconnect from contemporary pop artists like Duffy, Feist, and Miley Cyrus, punctuated by humorous insults and accusations of "gayness."  A caller, Ron from Michigan, offered a refreshing preference for classic Christmas songs. The conversation then swerved to Bjork and the perceived "faggyness" of current female pop stars. A discussion of a face transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, complete with graphic descriptions and jokes, followed, interrupted by the introduction of a new intern, Mason Reese.  The segment ended with a trivia segment on US natural disasters, followed by further banter on the face transplant, Madoff, the absence of Christmas specials, digital movie delivery, old drag races, and Eddie Murphy's potential casting as the Riddler.

The following segment started with a review of Eddie Murphy's film career, noting a perceived decline in quality post-*Coming to America*, and touched upon an internet rumor about a darker role for him.  A phone call with Dennis Leary, promoting his book, followed.  Leary credited Opie and Anthony listeners for boosting his sales, along with Jim Norton’s, and they brainstormed humorous promotional ideas.  Jack Cafferty's commentary on the Madoff case and the injustice of his house arrest then came up, further fueling the hosts' frustration.  The segment concluded with Anthony receiving a bizarre Christmas gift of Nazi paraphernalia, leading to discussions of its origins and German translations.  This was followed by listener calls about a child named Adolf Hitler Campbell and a supposed encounter with the “Bear Man," along with a discussion of a “Fonzie scheme.” Several Christmas gifts were opened, including a sex doll sent to Jimmy, before ending with Big A mysteriously bleeding profusely from his elbow. Dr. Steve was suggested as a possible source of explanation.

A subsequent segment focused on Andrew ("Big A") and his unexplained arm bleeding. Dr. Steve joined, offering medical advice and humorous banter with the hosts. Discussions of Andrew's sleep apnea and severe constipation ensued.  The segment continued with the opening of more sexually explicit Christmas gifts, including pornography with Nazi imagery, sex toys, and male enhancement products.  The main event involved a blow-up sex doll, triggering a highly explicit and sexually graphic discussion involving attempts to coerce various co-workers and a female fan ("Lily") into participating in sexual acts with the doll, some reluctantly complying.

The final segment consisted of a highly sexually explicit improvised role-playing scenario involving a husband (Sam), wife (Lily), and a bull (represented by a prop), with E-Rock also participating. This involved graphic descriptions of sexual acts and humorous physical comedy. This was followed by the "What Did You Learn Today?" segment, featuring listener calls, sexually suggestive banter, and a discussion of a monkey attack incident. The show ended with mentions of upcoming events, thanks for gifts, and a possible replay of a previous "marshmallow" bit, with Tank and Jimmy present throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Morning.  Hi!  Morning, everybody.  The time got away from me.  Still shoving some...  Where'd it go?  Cereal down my throat.  You had a grip on it, and then it got away from me.  Time will do that.  It sure will. 
[00:00:30]  Man.  Yes, Thursday edition of the Opie and Anthony program.  I'm just trying to eat all the blueberries. I figured that would be good enough.  Yeah?  Blueberries and my Honey Nut Cheerios.  Oh, Jesus. How many times are you going to be running back and forth to the bathroom?  Three times already today.  Three times?  Nobody got left. Like another two? 
[00:01:00]  No.  I'm done.  Done for the day.  Three times from the time you wake up till now.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Like clockwork.  Every morning.  And then maybe one in the afternoon.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  On a big eating morning.  The greatest is Saturday morning.  Because then the morning's like releases.  You don't have to get up early, so something happens with the body. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  What I noticed, like, do you really want to get into this?  No, not really, but.  I'm not as much as I should be during the week.  Something is always being held back because of these dumb hours.  And then Saturday, all bets are off.  Oh, really?  Saturday mornings.  I'll still get up at seven.  By ten o'clock, seven to eight.  Seven to eight.  Monster one.  So. 
[00:02:00]  Monster.  It's insanity.  I know.  It's your whole day.  I know.  It just revolves around that.  I don't know what it is.  But, you know, because I think.  Lay in pipe.  Well, it's too early in the morning.  Your body's like, all right, I'll do a little something for you.  But, you know, your body's asleep, too.  Yeah.  Like, don't bother me.  But Saturday mornings, oh, all right, we're awake and ready to go.  And it releases.  It releases for the week.  You remind me of me in the sense that my mother once told me as an adult. 
[00:02:30]  She's like, Jimmy, you never got out of the duty phase of your life.  Really?  Mentally, yeah.  And she's right, I haven't.  True.  And I think you're the same way.  You look at your.  I look at mine, too, and I'm like, I can't not look.  I want a camera every time if you want the truth.  Really?  Yeah.  I can't get rid of it fast enough down that turl.  I know.  You flush as you go.  Oh, courtesy.  But I never had this before we started doing mornings.  Mornings is just an animal. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  It just changes everything.  It changes your entire life.  Oh.  It is an odd lifestyle.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  But we are here and ready to roll again.  We're here.  We're ready.  Speaking of which, go see Milk.  Yeah?  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  That's Sean Penn.  He's an ass, but, man, he could act as you-know-what's off.  Is it titled for what's thrown on guys' books?  It's a rough last name to have if you're going to be a gay guy. 
[00:03:30]  That's for sure.  Milk.  That's a rough one.  I'm like, that's got to be a joke.  That's got to be his nickname.  No, he was born with the name Milk and becomes a gay activist out there in San Francisco.  The story of what?  Harvey Milk.  Yeah.  But that's Sean Penn.  God, he does some weird uber-liberal stuff in the world, but when it comes to acting.  He's quite a douche.  Yeah.  I was trying to be nice, but when it comes to acting, I don't know. 
[00:04:00]  Who's better than him?  Really?  Really?  Who's better than Sean Penn?  I know someone that knows him well, and he said that, eh, he's a bit of a douche for real.  Yeah, I can see that.  You could just tell.  God.  Which sucks for all us Fast Times at Ridgemont High fans.  You know, you just thought he was going to be this one guy in this movie.  He's going to be that cool dude that makes a million of those type of movies.  Yeah.  He's going to be Fast Times 2.  He doesn't even acknowledge that he made that movie. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Which is like one of the greatest comedies ever.  It doesn't matter to him.  Oh, he doesn't even...  He's made plenty more after that.  He doesn't even come close to reprising that character either.  No.  No.  Look at that picture.  That was that one where he was talking about surfing.  I'll tell you, the man-on-man kiss, you never get used to seeing that in film.  Oh, I was going to say, you never see anything hotter.  You never get used to seeing that on film or when Sam's doing it for us on a regular basis, it seems. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  There's just something about that.  You try to be an adult, and you're watching a movie that's a very important piece of work.  Yeah.  And then that man-on-man kiss, and it just turns you into an eight-year-old where you're just like, wow, I'm just not a full adult yet.  Girl on girl, there's no problem with it.  It's just, it's like, oh, wow, check it out.  Yeah.  Guy on guy, like, whoa.  And you try to be cool, like, all right, I'm an adult. 
[00:05:30]  I could watch this.  And it just does something to you.  I know.  You're like, ugh.  Bill Burr's got a great bit on that whole thing where he talks about the man-on-man kiss.  And, you know, because Bill's a pretty liberal guy, and he's not homophobic or anything like that.  But he said he saw two guys kissing and kind of made a face like, ugh.  And some girl started giving him crap.  He goes, no, I'm just, I'm not used to that.  That's what it is.  One thing, you know, took me by surprise. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I don't think the reaction is that you're a homophobe.  It's that it's very extremely foreign to you.  Yeah.  You know, make that puzzled look like a, I don't know.  For the people that, and I know it's a small percentage of the people we're probably talking to right now,  for the people that go see Milk, notice the man-on-man kissing,  and notice that Sean Penn obviously made a deal with everybody.  He goes, I'll give you one real good one.  Oh, no, really?  It was so obvious to me. 
[00:06:30]  I love picking apart movies.  I'm a real douche.  I'm the guy that, like, whispers, like, the plots and stuff in movie theaters.  And go, oh, look, they made a mistake.  That car wasn't around when this movie was supposed to be taking place.  I'm one of those guys.  And I noticed that Sean Penn gave him a really good one early on.  Couple little pecs throughout the rest of the movie.  And then when it was, you know, man-on-man kissing again,  it was filmed in such a way that it was obvious he wasn't doing any more of that kissing crap.  Oh, they do it from, like, the back or something. 
[00:07:00]  They have a shot in that movie.  He's nude in bed with another gentleman.  Jiminy Cricket.  And he leans over to really get into some man-on-man kissing.  And there's a shadow perfectly placed where the lips would go.  So he leans into the shadow.  The other dude leans into the shadow.  And you're like, okay, that's why they filmed that.  Because Sean Penn has said, look, no more kissing for me.  I gave you the good one in the beginning.  I'm done.  He gave him the good one?  What was it, like, complete tongue? 
[00:07:30]  It was...  Oh, God.  How do you do that as an actor?  And it was the dude from the Spider-Man movie.  What's his name?  Bobby McGuire.  Willem Dafoe's son.  Oh, all right.  I forgot his name.  Oh, that...  Yeah, that guy is prominently gay in this movie.  Wow.  Prominently gay.  I never liked any of his works.  What else was he in?  Yeah, he was...  Because I barely remembered he was in Spider-Man. 
[00:08:00]  You know, I had to be reminded of that after the movie.  He was in, like, Fly Boys or something.  Yeah.  He was in a couple of, like, war movies trying to change his image, I think.  Yeah.  You just see him and it's like, eh, this guy should be on, like, Buffy the Vampire Slayer or something.  He doesn't have that thing.  James Franco.  I don't see him and think, like, wow, there's a Hollywood actor.  Oh, really?  I think, eh.  You just see him pop up here and there.  I think, you know, one of those second, third-rate network TV show guys. 
[00:08:30]  Right, right.  It seems like these guys...  Do you think now, like, the actors playing gay guys, like, after Ledger and Gyllenhaal did it.  Yeah.  Like...  See, a movie I still can't see, by the way.  Brokeback?  And I don't even know why I can't see that movie.  I just...  It's a good movie.  That's what they say.  I just, uh...  Not even, you know, for the homeless.  It's a little more boring than I wanted it to be, honestly.  Yeah.  It was good, but it was a little more, like, uh...  I guess it was a good love story, you know?  I mean, it was what it was, but...  Yeah.  It seems like that, to me, is, like, the bar they set now. 
[00:09:00]  Like, you know, actors have these weird things.  And so it's not enough to play a mobster.  It's like, you want to be for real?  Mm-hmm.  This is what you got to do.  You want to prove you can act...  It's almost like that's now their...  That's the bar now.  Elite club.  Sure.  It's like, all right, well, you're going to have to do some, uh, gay kissing.  Well, now they...  But they all want to top each other in Hollywood, so you know this is going to end in a bad place.  Oh, where's it going?  A bad place.  Where's it going?  Oh, yeah, well...  Oh, boy.  Well, you know, that American History X scene with Edward Norton in the bathroom. 
[00:09:30]  Sure.  The shower of the prison.  Yeah.  That was pretty brutal.  That was pretty rough.  Ooh.  But, uh, yeah, it's obvious to me Sean Penn made some kind of deal.  I'm done.  I'll give you a good one.  You better film it good, too, because I'm only doing one take on this.  The Dufresne and the shower scene there was good with the sisters.  What was the name of the head sister guy in that? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, God, was he awful.  Hard to get.  I like when they play that, and he starts soaping up his chest, looking up all gay-like.  The sisters.  Eastwood tried it and escaped from Alcatraz, but he couldn't commit to any of it, like  not being gay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even getting a hit on, the guy's like wolf.  He's like, I'm looking for a new punk.  And Clint Eastwood's acting was so bad, he goes, well, why don't you show me what you  got?  Show me what you got.  Hey, you know what?  Yeah, that was really bad. 
[00:10:30]  Terrible.  We've been kind of just throwing the ball around, but I think Jimmy nailed it, because  like you said, Brokeback Mountain set the standard, and some of these big-time actors played gay  before that.  So we want actors that played gay really bad.  Yeah, who played gay real bad?  Mike mentioned I just held up cruising with Pacino.  Even if he wasn't gay, he was playing undercover.  It still looked uncomfortable.  He was also gay in Dog Day Afternoon, where he was believable.  Yeah, yeah.  But he wasn't like so blatantly gay. 
[00:11:00]  He didn't have to do anything, really.  That was...  Yeah, I don't know.  That was kind of weird.  I want to see the Clint Eastwood scene now.  Dude, it's so...  I don't remember it.  I mean, I love that movie, but I just haven't seen it in a long time.  He doesn't want to have sex with Wolf.  Kevin Wolf's a bad, tough guy.  Right, right, right.  But he's like, why don't you show me what you got?  And then he kind of puts his arm around Wolf like they're going to hug, and then he  gut punches him in the neck.  Yeah, punches him in the belly. 
[00:11:30]  Leaves Wolf on the floor.  I remember the scene.  I just don't remember how bad Eastwood was.  Oh, it's Stunkaroo.  Hey, let's go to Becca in Jersey.  Becca.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Hello.  Hey, Becca.  So, my husband was nice enough to come with me to see Brokeback Mountain when it was in  the Cedars.  He is a police officer here in New Jersey, and he let that one slip out at work.  Now they hang pictures of cowboys. 
[00:12:00]  Nice.  That's sure.  And that's exactly what they should be doing.  Yeah, I agree.  I wouldn't expect anything less from the cops.  Yeah, pretty much.  You're also saying James Franco had a gay kiss in Pineapple Express?  Yeah.  See, I didn't see Pineapple Express.  I don't know why I haven't seen that movie yet.  Yeah, I didn't see that one either.  Well, I know, honestly, I haven't seen it either, but you guys were thinking what movie  was he in, and I'm thinking he was the dude in Pineapple Express.  I just wanted to shout that out. 
[00:12:30]  All right, right on.  Willem Dafoe has one in To Live and Die in L.A., which is like an old 80s movie.  Yeah, it was a good movie, counterfeiting and stuff like that.  And it's obviously a guy who's doing this stage show thing and comes off stage into the dressing  room, starts kissing Willem Dafoe, and then there's such an obvious bad cut to where they  replaced it with a woman.  And it turns out to be his girlfriend. 
[00:13:00]  But you're supposed to think that it was a guy at first.  Right.  But it was a guy.  Like, you saw the back, big manly back.  And then they change it, and it's like, oh, it's his girlfriend.  Oh, really?  They wanted you to think he might be kissing the guy?  Yeah, that's what you were thinking at first.  Like, oh, what the hell?  This guy's, like, gay?  And then, you know, it's his hot chick.  Robin Williams is the over-the-top gay guy in Birdcage.  Oh, oh.  With Nathan Lane.  Oh, did he just play that one off bed? 
[00:13:30]  That was bad gay.  That was bad gay.  What about Bruce Willis and Jackal?  Yeah?  I didn't see it.  I don't think I saw Jackal.  Rob, Long Island, how are you?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Yeah, and the Jackal, he plays this, like, crazy killer, and he's stalking this guy, you  know, in, like, a gay club, and they show him kiss, and, you know, in some movies, they,  like, maybe pan the camera at a certain angle so you don't see anything too disturbing, but  they just see open-mouthed tongue spit-swapping, and it's very disturbing to see Bruce Willis 
[00:14:00]  just commit to something like that, you know?  That's committing to something, all right.  You know who wouldn't do that?  Will Smith.  Hi, man.  Hi, man.  We call it Six Degrees of Separation.  Sure.  With Donald Sutherland and Sokka Channing, where he played a gay hustler in New York, and I  think he wouldn't kiss the guy.  Yeah.  I think he regretted that, too.  He kind of, I think he said in hindsight that he wished he had.  Was Anthony Michael Hall?  You don't want in hindsight go, I wish I had.  Well, for the movie.  No, I know.  I wish I did kiss the guy.  There was Anthony Michael Hall or something in that movie, too? 
[00:14:30]  I don't remember.  I think it was.  And there was a movie in 88 with Ryan O'Neill called Partners, where they actually had to  pretend to be, he had to pretend to be gay with another cop to solve a bunch of  gay murders.  And it was, like, 20 years ago, and they were just totally mocking everything.  And it's kind of shifted a little bit.  I don't know if you remember.  The ass cheeks cut out of the pants and their clothes in the posters.  Yeah, why not?  De Niro in Stardust.  Oh, I don't think I saw that.  I didn't see Stardust.  What about Oz?  Well, that's a whole other subject. 
[00:15:00]  What about, was that Will Ferrell in, what was that race car movie that he did with  Tallahassee?  Tallahassee?  Borat.  Yeah, Talladega Nights.  Right, sure.  That was just on TV the other day.  That was, like, a big, wet, tonguey kiss that he did with Borat.  And then Dylan has one.  Well, Borat, you know, come on.  Yeah.  He's at men's.  Well, I mean, the naked wrestling scene. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, there's something else going on there.  Dylan, what do you got, buddy?  Set in the bar, less than zero.  What was it, mid-80s, Robert Downey Jr.?  Yeah, Robert Downey Jr. did a little something-something because he needed that.  A little something-something.  He needed the drugs.  What about, what's that show, HBO, Six Feet Under?  Six Feet Under?  I never saw Six Feet Under.  Nothing was worse than, and believe me, again, I hate when you have to preface things like  this, like, hey, I didn't watch it. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  I didn't watch it.  But there was that one, that gay Showtime show.  Gay as folk or queer as folk.  Yeah.  I never saw.  You know, because you'd be going around on the channels.  Could be the gayest show that has ever been on television.  It was just guys engaging in gay sex.  Every time that passed by the channel. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, there's.  This is the gayest scene ever filmed.  All right.  We're watching Borat wrestle the big fat guy naked.  Yeah, two men just, I mean, come on.  What?  They are absolutely, completely naked.  I just saw this on TV literally two days ago.  I'm like, he's insane.  All over each other.  He's a really funny guy.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Just rolling around with the big fat naked guy in the hotel bed. 
[00:17:00]  And then running through the hotel.  The other thing blacking out his piece there.  But it makes it look like it's his piece.  It makes it look like it's three feet long.  Yeah.  And then running down the hall chasing the guy.  With a rubber fist.  Yeah, the rubber fist.  All right.  We're going to clear the field here.  The phones are lit.  We didn't even want to really go down this road.  I don't know.  It just happened, I guess. 
[00:17:30]  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Of course.  And that's like, that's like, those, that's, he's got women's boobs.  Yeah.  I mean, I know fat guys, they got, they got.  Oh, that guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Fat guys have a little boob action going on.  But that guy has women's.  Yeah.  You call them breasts at that point.  Yeah.  God, that's like, yeah, meatloaf and fight club.  Right.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  He's got those.  He's got the exact same thing happening.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to move into, like, the real stuff next, I guess. 
[00:18:00]  Now, what, the MTA did their thing?  Yeah.  So we get the one-two combo the last couple of days.  Yeah, of course.  The one-two combo.  And the paper's filling out, figuring out this tax thing.  Oh, are they?  And how much it's going to cost the regular, the regular Joe.  And where it's going, have they said that?  So, yeah, we'll get into it in a minute or two.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Oh, man, I wish we had time to play a little air guitar today, Hank. 
[00:18:30]  Come on.  Oh, this song, of course.  We love doing it to this one, but too much going on in the news.  Effing cop killer got off.  We'll get into that a little later.  Unbelievable.  What's wrong with this country?  But Jimmy, also mad about, I don't even know his name.  That scum.  Bernie Madoff?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Madoff.  Madoff.  Yeah, he made off with a lot of people's money.  Waka waka.  He's been allowed to stay in his... 
[00:19:00]  Originally, the judge said he had to have four people to sign to say that he should make  his $10 million bail.  Yep.  He had X amount of time to do it, a couple days, whatever.  He could only get two.  Then the dumb judge gave him an extra day.  Yeah.  He still couldn't get the other two.  So then the judge changed and said, okay, you can just have two.  Why are they giving this guy so many liberties?  He should be on Rikers Island.  That's the problem with these white collar guys.  They never have to deal with real penalties, physical penalties. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  If you, like, $50 billion, if I was to run into a store and steal a bunch of merchandise  and I couldn't make bail, and I was middle class or poor, I would stay in jail for 50 days.  It was worth, like, a couple hundred dollars.  You'd be, you know...  Yeah, let's go with $500 worth of merch or something.  Let's try how much money this guy took.  Yeah.  $50 billion.  Dude, he's ruining...  His property should all be seized, every bit of it.  Should be up on a block to be sold once he's convicted, and then just start giving it back  to the charities and the pensions that he raped. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  I hope he's paranoid every time he leaves that really nice penthouse of his on the Upper East  Side.  He'll hire a security guard, dude.  He'll hire someone to protect him.  Yes.  As opposed to Rikers Island, where he should not be protected.  He should be dragged into the street and made to, you know, answer some questions.  He'd be thrown on Rikers, let him deal with the criminal element in Rikers, and if he  walks in with a couple of his teeth missing, that's what happens.  Oh, well.  Eh, but the theme is, you know, nothing changes, and we just continue with our lives, bitching 
[00:20:30]  and complaining, but what can we do?  It's that white-collar crime, like Jim said.  It's just, it's a whole other animal.  They don't seem to, they really don't seem to hit him up like they do with other crimes.  If this guy took that much money in any other form or in any other way, you know, some people  do their work with guns, some do it with fountain pens.  Ellis, die hard.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  I'd do mine with a fountain pen.  Speaking of Ellis, I'll do the seg for everybody.  Robert Ellis was found not guilty of murder.  Yeah.  A little case we had here in New York.  About a, what was it, a year and a half ago?  Yep.  Traffic stop, cops, stolen BMW, some of the homies in the car loaded with weapons, and they 
[00:21:30]  open up on these cops, and, um, not guilty of murder.  A dead cop.  Not guilty.  And what are they saying?  What are they saying?  Outrage.  Well, of course there's outrage, but why are they saying this guy's not guilty?  They don't know who the shooter is or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're like, oh, they don't know who the shooter is, but you know  something, uh, you're in that car, uh, it's during the commission of a felony, uh, murdering  a police officer, so everyone goes. 
[00:22:00]  I thought that's how it worked.  Everyone goes.  You're all, uh, guilty.  Will Reverend Albie, uh, murder.  Will Reverend Albie throw in a party today?  Yeah, of course he will.  Well, those scumbags.  I can't, I just, it's beyond me that this guy, and watch, he's, he's, he's not gonna be  this, uh, upstanding member of society, he's still up on weapons charges, which, uh, three  weapons charges, each could get 15 years, so now they're, they're begging that he does 
[00:22:30]  all 45.  It's like, please give him the mask.  At least give him all 45, please.  I don't know.  I'd love to, I'd love to see this jury.  Love to see the makeup of this jury that they got for this, uh, this guy.  Like, oh my God, was the head of the, um, uh, Policeman's Benevolent Association and  ever, just angry.  Yeah.  Oh, was he saying some stuff.  Yeah.  Calling a, yeah, just calling him an animal and a mongrel. 
[00:23:00]  And, uh, yeah, well, you know, hopefully, yeah, he does get, uh, the max for the weapons  charges, but if, if something happens where this guy walks, oh Jesus, he's gonna have a  bit of a hard time on the streets, I'd say.  Yeah.  I think he might be getting pulled over a lot.  Watching these cops, because now it's all over the news, the cops walking these guys  through.  I don't care what you're, how frightening is that when you've got, because the cops are  just lining up, and you know that every one of them wants to put a bullet in this guy. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, absolutely.  And the cops don't play.  Especially in this situation, they don't play.  They didn't get into detail on, uh, the news station I was listening to on the way in,  but they said they were also trying to cop this Sean Bell defense, where, uh, uh, they  were saying, hey, I didn't know, uh, how these cops are gonna treat me, um, once, uh, I, I,  if I said the wrong thing, uh, were they just gonna open fire on me? 
[00:24:00]  So, you know, almost trying this self-defense thing, where it's like, geez, shut it, you're  in a stolen car, a bunch of illegal weapons, and, uh, a dead cop.  Just ridiculous.  Here's, here's the, uh, you know, look, they got footage, they got, like, they got, they  got surveillance, uh, uh, tapes of, of the whole thing.  And look at the, look at the, yeah, you're right, look at these cops. 
[00:24:30]  They just want to kill these guys.  Did the prosecutor blow it?  I don't understand.  I don't, they, they, they got video of the, the shooting.  They're gonna get, probably, I think they tried it, um, they didn't try it as if he  was the shooter.  I don't know what they did wrong.  The defense said, not to second guess the prosecutor, but they should have tried it as  if Woods, I guess one of the other three guys was the shooter.  One of the other guys was the shooter, but, like I said.  I don't know.  They all should go down.  They all, they all should go down.  Every single one of them. 
[00:25:00]  Everyone in that car goes.  Goodbye.  Hey, that actor right now, that's what's going on with that, that kid.  With Lilo Brancato?  Yeah.  That's what he did, because he was, in, in, acting with the other guy in a commission of a felony,  I think.  Yeah.  So they're gonna get him the same penalty for shooting a cop, even though he had, he's  a guy who I really think had no idea that the cop was about to get shot.  Right.  Well, it's a little more difficult, because, uh, he can't play the race card.  Right.  You know.  These guys all pull out the race card.  Every time there's a case like this, the scumbag defense attorneys, these guys that I don't  know how they sleep with themselves at night, uh, uh, just start playing the race card. 
[00:25:30]  Playing that race card, huh?  Good.  Another upstanding member of society found not guilty of murder.  Ugh.  But the alternate jurors were not happy.  No.  One alternate juror goes, uh, I tell you, the son of a bitch is guilty.  Uh, alternate, uh, Luis Vieira told, uh, WNBC, as guilty as you can ever be.  He was in the car.  He knew the guns were there.  He killed a cop, and he's walking.  What justice is that?  That was an alternate juror. 
[00:26:00]  Well, they have one juror who said, a lot of us didn't understand the difference between  the laws.  Why didn't you raise your hand and ask questions, you dummies?  Oh, please show me the jury.  Please.  Because I just, I have a theory.  How do we see a picture of the jury?  I don't know.  Uh, let's go to Woody in Florida.  There might be a little hope.  Woody, what do you got?  Hey, Ope, hey, what's up, Jimmy?  Um, back in, like, the early 90s, when I was working up in the Bronx, one of the undercovers  we worked with got shot, and it was dead to rights, and a Bronx jury let the guy off. 
[00:26:30]  And what they ended up doing was, the feds come in, and they take the case, uh, federally,  and they, uh, arrest them for, like, civil rights violation, and they all ended up getting,  like, 25 years.  So there is another way they can get them.  Yeah, they can at times do that for different, like, that's actually how they got when, when,  when the guys, the cops, actually, they actually, the guys who, uh, in the regional Denny were  acquitted, they actually came in and got them on civil rights violations.  Yeah.  Yeah, they do that from time to time.  But can they do, murder, I guess, is a state charge. 
[00:27:00]  Isn't it different with murder?  Yeah, but, like, civil rights violation comes under a different purview, and they can take  them that way.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Just folks that should just be thrown, thrown away.  Yeah.  Like, the garbage they are, throw them away.  They're never going to be productive members of society.  They're always going to be threats, uh, threatening to, to, to people that are trying to live their  lives, uh, uh, within the boundaries of the law. 
[00:27:30]  Take this garbage and throw it on the heap, either, either with the death penalty or just  let them rot away in prison with the rest of the trash in there.  The death penalty?  That's it.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Please, I know.  I know.  We all rah-rah'd when we heard they brought the death penalty back in New York.  When Pataki signed that one.  That was a joke.  He should have said it was a joke at the time.  But no one with the courage to use it.  Right.  All these liberal douche prosecutors and judges and everything else that wouldn't seek the 
[00:28:00]  death penalty on some of the most heinous cases.  But that's the new thing they do.  They bring back the death penalty to make some, some people happy, but they don't use it,  which makes the other people happy.  Yeah.  It's a win-win, right?  Yeah.  Because there's a lot of people out there going, well, we have the death penalty, so that's  good.  They're never going to use it.  It's a win-win for stupid people.  Well, exactly.  Everyone who knows the reality of the situation knows no one, no one gets the death penalty  in New York City or in New York State.  Wow.  I don't know what you, I don't know what you have to do in New York to get the death penalty. 
[00:28:30]  You mean to tell me since, since Pataki was governor.  What year was the death penalty reinstated?  We do this every once in a while.  It's, it's been a long time.  It's got to be almost, what, 10 years?  I would go at least 10.  Sure.  You mean to tell me in that 10 years, in the state of New York, not one case, not one  murder case has been heinous enough and obvious enough that whoever it was actually did it  to warrant a death penalty? 
[00:29:00]  We've been such a good state.  I'm sure we've found one severed head in the last 10 years.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe a nice child murder or something like that, a rape murder, whatever, whatever.  1995.  95.  We've reinstated it.  All right, so 13 years.  13 years and not one person's been put to death under the death penalty.  And you can't, you can't find one case?  We haven't even come close to using it.  Yeah.  Not even like, wow, that was a close one.  They don't even seek it.  Say yes, we're going to be seeking the death penalty. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, it's just.  What has been the most heinous crime in New York?  Yeah.  New York State, since the death penalty was reinstated.  Give us a great, heinous, nasty, know-the-guy-did-it crime.  Right.  And tell me whether it warrants the death penalty or not.  And there's got to be some, you know, special circumstances.  Oh, yeah.  Like he chopped the guy's head off and had a soccer game, you know, something just ridiculous.  Made him into stew and fed him to his family.  Right.  Like they ate his girlfriend's brains.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  There's got to be one of those.  Yeah, give us one.  Like, the whole thing is a joke.  This whole system is a joke.  You got, what, Carolyn Kennedy, she wants to be senator?  Yeah.  She doesn't even have qualifications.  She does that last name.  Yeah.  Who gives a crap?  She's got the same DNA as some of the bigwigs in her family.  Yeah.  There's guys that are qualified that deserve that spot.  American royalty.  But she's humoring everybody because she's traveling around New York State talking to people. 
[00:30:30]  Is that it?  Getting the feel of the people before she decides if this is something she's going to do.  It hasn't been a peep out of this girl in forever.  What the hell is her qualifications?  That's what I learned about politics.  All of a sudden you go, you know what?  I want that gig.  Dude, what has she done over the past?  They can't find anything that she's really done.  I mean, I don't even know what she did.  She raises money very well.  She's written a couple of books on the Constitution.  Jimmy Norton's written a couple of books.  Yeah, right.  And she raises a lot of money. 
[00:31:00]  She's a fundraiser.  She's not out there doing, like, parties and socialite stuff, but she does lend her name to the family.  That's wonderful.  What has she done politically?  Nothing.  What has she gotten past?  She got behind Obama.  What has she done to make it a little easier for us to live in New York State?  Nothing.  Does she know what is in New York State's best interest as far as going to Washington and trying to get funding or anything else?  I mean, you kind of need to know.  You kind of forget, but, you know, Hillary Clinton was able to get that gig without really any political offices before that. 
[00:31:30]  She was always a butt-inskey when her husband was pregnant.  No, I understand all that, but she, you know, she didn't have much of a resume when she ended up getting that gig.  Yeah.  Well, she was a lawyer.  Oh, great.  I'm talking politics.  She had a partner in a law firm, first lady in the state, first lady in the country for eight years, so she at least had some statesmanship.  Hillary.  Hillary was, to me, Hillary was a lot more qualified than she was.  Yeah, I would agree with you, Jimmy. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, there she is on TV shaking hands.  Go home and raise your kids!  Mrs. Schlossberg has been raising money, and you never hear about the husband anymore.  Was she JFK's daughter?  She was, right?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She doesn't know crap.  That's how bad people, that's how much people love John Kennedy.  They, they, he's the last, she's like the last link to him, because the son is dead.  Yeah.  And I mean, she's the last thing that reminds people of JFK.  Yeah.  Like, for, like, direct. 
[00:32:30]  All right, we're going back.  Maybe she had a point, though, just laying low.  Yeah.  You know, if you're a Kennedy, if you're a Kennedy, just kind of go to a, go to a metal vault and lock yourself in there.  Right.  Jeez, not the best of luck with that family.  Death penalty 13 years ago was reinstated.  We're amazed it's never been used.  We're trying to find the most heinous case in the last 13 years.  Yeah.  Sean from the NYPD.  What's up, Sean?  What's up, brothers?  Listen, the Wendy's massacre.  Oh, that was a good one, yeah.  Yeah, they, uh, not only did these S-bags, what they did after they robbed the place, which one of them knew, all the employees, they lined them up execution style and shot them each in the back of the head. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Luckily, one of them lived and was able to testify against the others.  Where was that in Wanks?  I do remember that.  That was in Queens, right?  Queens, yeah.  Yeah.  And that was about 10, over 10 years ago, I think.  Is it 10 years ago already?  I can't believe it.  It might be.  And, uh, whatever, why didn't they use the death penalty? 
[00:33:30]  Actually, I think it wasn't even on the books back then.  Well, we're looking for cases in the last 13 years, and I think that Wendy's thing did happen within the last...  I think it was within, uh...  I don't even think it was 10 years ago.  I think that was a mere five or six years ago.  It was.  That was a nice, heinous execution type of crime.  The ACLU has been protesting it ever since Pataki signed it.  So, the ACLU has been holding it up.  But don't let me ask you a question.  Don't...  The problem is...  I think with Robert Johnson, he's still the prosecutor in the Bronx, like the lead DA. 
[00:34:00]  I could be wrong.  But don't they have to kind of...  They have to go for it, and he said, I won't seek it.  Like, he's allowed his personal preference.  He said right away, you know, I'm not going to seek the death penalty.  It's like, yeah, that's your personal preference.  Again, you know, not representing the interest of the people.  Ah, they don't represent us.  No.  I don't know when that ended, but they certainly don't represent us anymore.  Nope.  I don't know what the hell these people do up in Albany or down there in Washington.  It's become such a machine that just runs the same way that no one's willing to really change. 
[00:34:30]  Not Obama either.  Don't let him fool you.  It's a machine that has been put into motion that is now...  That's just the way it runs.  They found the easiest way to run it, the easiest way for them to, you know, give themselves raises,  put their own agendas through based on their own, you know, constituents, 
[00:35:00]  and giving them favors, doing them favors so they get their job back.  The last thing they think about is representing their people.  The first thing they think about is, how am I going to keep this gig and get elected next time the election rolls around?  Yeah.  So I have to do this.  I have to do favors for this guy.  I got to make it seem like I'm doing this to get the popular vote.  It's just, it's a machine.  It's all crap. 
[00:35:30]  It is.  Now, that said, all this death penalty talk, I'm still kind of leaning against it, but that's not for liberal reasons.  Why?  I just don't think that people get the same, rich and poor get the same thing.  It's just, it's not about it being unconstitutional.  But look at the way this made-off is allowed to live, you know, oh, they changed the rules for them.  If you got that kind of money, you get better defense, you get treated a lot better.  That's the only reason.  I think if you ruin as many lives as this guy did, this $50 billion guy,  look, there are just some cases that absolutely warrant the death penalty. 
[00:36:00]  I'm sorry.  There are.  When the death penalty starts getting used as like a tool for getting someone off the hook  or one of these, well, circumstantial evidence says that he did it, then, all right, whatever.  But, Anthony, it costs more money to kill them than put them away for the rest of their lives.  Pay.  Then I'll pay.  Exactly. 
[00:36:30]  It's one of those situations, though, where there are people that absolutely are guilty of horrid crimes  that should be put to death.  That's it.  Easy.  I don't care if you make a lot of money or no money.  Whatever.  Just put them away.  I agree with you.  All right.  Wait, Jimmy.  Look at this guy, you know, this cop killer.  He wasn't a rich guy.  He got a lawyer, and he got off the hook.  Yeah.  So it doesn't matter, he's rich or poor in that case.  Here we go.  I got two cases that, tell me if these guys deserve the death penalty. 
[00:37:00]  We got Chris with the first one.  Go ahead, Chris.  How are you doing, boys?  All these, go ahead, sorry.  All right.  It's all right.  It's your show.  Go ahead.  No, no, I messed you up.  For real, I messed you up.  Go ahead, Chris.  Okay.  Well, there was a murder in upstate.  I think it was Hopewell.  They murdered the entire family, including the youngest, the six-year-old, which they beat to death.  They burned down the house while the kid was still alive. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  I think they stabbed the two oldest children.  And I think it was, I forgot, but.  The father lost his entire family.  I remember this kid.  That was Connecticut, though.  Wasn't that Connecticut?  Was it Connecticut?  I think there was one in Connecticut, but there was one in upstate New York.  Oh, okay.  I'm thinking about the two Russian guys.  Okay.  That's what I was thinking of.  Yeah.  Who raped and killed the wife and two daughters, and they tried to kill the father with a hammer,  but he lived. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  That's what I'm thinking of, too.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's what I thought you were talking about.  All right.  This is a whole different case.  Yeah.  I think because they just went to the trial.  They were found guilty, but one of them got 50 years, and the other one got, I think,  four life sentences, but they murdered an entire family, and in such a brutal fashion that I  And you do realize you get cable in prison, right?  Yeah.  I could pretty much live my life if all I had was cable.  You get cable.  You get a job.  You get to go out and work out. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, something might happen to you eventually.  You might get shanked or beat up, but it happens in regular life sometimes.  That's right.  It's one of those mysteries of life.  Well, there's a great example from Chris.  The whole family bites it.  The six-year-old, they burn down the house.  The kid's still alive, like, in bad shape in the house.  And someone decided, nah.  Nah, not good enough.  That's not good enough.  Nah.  I just, my only problem with it, it's not about, I think it's not deserved, is I don't 
[00:39:00]  trust the jury system enough.  Like, when you look at how, like, this guy did get off, but look at what a lousy decision  that is.  Look at how lousy the jury was.  And I've seen too many shows on guys who really didn't do it.  And then, like, in Texas, there's a certain, you have a certain amount of time where if  you don't get evidence in, they don't have to accept new evidence.  It's like these weird little things that can actually stop an innocent guy from getting  out in a death penalty case.  And it can happen.  And that's the only thing that bothers me about it.  I'm willing to take that chance.  If a few innocent ones bite it too, if it helps society in general, I'm all for it. 
[00:39:30]  Here's greedy, selfish Anthony.  Yeah.  I know I ain't going to be sitting there going, uh-oh, am I getting the death penalty?  Right, right.  Eh, get out of here.  Disgusts me.  You watch that, there's a show I saw on HBO about a guy who was convicted, he spent 20  years for a crime he didn't commit.  And, like, when you're watching it, like, the documentary people followed him for 10 years  in jail.  It's kind of obvious that he didn't.  But when you watch the way the system works with stuff like, it's like the prosecutors  sometimes, and I don't mean in this case, but, like, when they're wrong like that, 
[00:40:00]  they'll never come out and go, we are wrong, there's an innocent guy there, because that  messes up their track, that's the problem I have with it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  Uh, Ben and Queens, the Wendy story, the guy did get the death penalty, but it was reversed.  And then we got one, oh, where did, the Evans story, I wanted the Evans story, that guy  should call back.  Oh.  Uh, something with a severed head and having sex with the body, that guy didn't get the  death penalty either.  Maybe that guy will call back.  All right.  He'll get a reality show. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, phones are lit, we'll continue with this.  So, 13 years we've had the death penalty reinstated here in New York State.  Yeah.  It hasn't been used, it won't be used, and we want to kind of know why, and we want to  find the most heinous case in the last 13 years, just to prove our point.  Who was the dope that said, nah, not good enough for the death penalty?  Nah, not good enough.  O.P. and Anthony, stay there.  Oh, yeah.  Now we're talking.  Now we're talking. 
[00:41:00]  I'll just play Doors music today.  I'd be so happy, yeah.  I would just sit here and listen to every single one of these songs.  I hate the Doors.  Sing along to a few.  I hate the Doors.  Even the ones that didn't make the radio.  Dude.  Especially the ones that didn't make the radio.  Really?  Overrated drivel from some friggin' lunatic.  Hey, man, you're not going to wreck my buzz.  An American poet, man, was he? 
[00:41:30]  Timeless, my friend.  Timeless?  You're not wrecking my buzz today.  Is this saying timeless?  It just sounds as old as it is.  The Doors stink.  I like their hits.  I don't know.  Backlit, break on through.  You know, the big one.  You like the hits?  I do.  Like the ends I love.  You cannot petition the Lord with Britt.  Shut up.  What are you talking about?  You spoiled brat.  Didn't he have a military dad or something like that? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  His dad hated him.  An army dad.  His dad hated him because he was a mouthy ass.  Didn't your dad like you?  Loved me.  All right.  That was perfect.  I was a crybaby.  It's a perfect story, man.  Military dad.  He went off to become like a hippie in L.A.  Met Ray Manzurk as he's just wandering the beach.  Next thing you know, you get some just amazing music. 
[00:42:30]  When does he start singing here?  I don't know.  I'm waiting for his voice to kick in.  How about waiting?  Waiting for you to roar.  Come on.  I hate the Doors.  What about Peace Frog?  Oh, shit.  People of Strange is a good song.  People of Strange, when you're a stranger. 
[00:43:00]  That's right.  I do like that one.  What about Riders on the Storm?  Oh, God.  Riders on the Storm.  How many times?  Nice.  I heard he wrote this, walking from the village up to somewhere in New York, just walking.  This is kind of where this one came from.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Right.  Was that in No One Here Gets Out Alive?  Guy in a caddy, she's a tranny.  Out of the rain, when you're strange. 
[00:43:30]  Come on.  Who cares?  This is great for, you know, 1968.  Some hippie chick got me into the Doors.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  In junior high.  I didn't even know you could be a hippie in junior high, but this broad was.  She turned me out to the Doors, and I never looked back.  I'm like, yeah, right on, man.  I'm in.  I'm in with this Jim Morrison guy.  I like it. 
[00:44:00]  Hell yeah.  Who for the room.  L.A. woman?  Come on.  I know that's a hit, but come on.  It's just so overrated.  I'm not going to go with The End or any of those other songs.  You know.  The End was great.  I kind of like it, too.  I love that song.  I just like it in the context of Apocalypse.  Yeah.  That was kind of cool.  Well.  Well.  Yeah, because it was in the context of something that was in the 60s that is not timeless music.  There is some music that is not timeless. 
[00:44:30]  It just sounds old.  Yeah, I mean.  I mean, this definitely sounds old, but it could still be played on the radio.  It fits.  No.  It fits in there.  On a classic rock station.  See, my new format, I would have the Doors.  What?  Right up against Nirvana.  Nirvana's classic rock now, too.  I understand that, but there was a bit of a difference between the, you know.  Jimmy died in what year?  70 what?  Deuce bags.  Jim.  How far apart did him, Hendrix, and Joplin die? 
[00:45:00]  Was it very close together, right?  Three days.  Speaking.  That magical age of 27, Jimmy.  70, 71, I think, right?  That's why they're saying, what's her name over there in England is going to drop, because  I think she's 27 now.  Amy?  Amy Winehouse.  Amy Winehouse, yeah.  All right, we'll move on.  So, 13 years we've had the death penalty in New York.  Hold on.  You see, who cares?  Yes.  I love it.  Amy Winehouse.  Amy Winehouse.  They don't give a crap about much.  Enough of her on the papers.  Maybe it's a big thing in England. 
[00:45:30]  No one gives a crap about this bitch in the United States.  They give a crap.  What?  The media freaking is showing her falling down all over the place here in America.  Yeah, the media cares.  Do you even give a half a crap about Amy Winehouse?  I don't care if she dies or anything, no.  And her stupid big hair and her big gut.  I kind of like that Rehab song when it first came out, the first hundred times I heard it.  She's a mess.  You've got to love it all.  She is a mess.  Yeah.  Complete mess.  But that's like an England thing.  Like, for some reason, they think we care over here. 
[00:46:00]  But we do, because it's on all the websites all the time.  That's because they're all UK websites.  You go to Drudge and you see an Amy Winehouse story, you click on it, you watch your browser.  It'll be a UK site.  All those things.  You go to FARC and you see some of those stories.  Yeah.  UK.  The Daily Mirror.  Oh, let's read The Mirror.  What does it say today about Amy Winehouse?  Who cares?  She's a disaster. 
[00:46:30]  In America, we love disasters.  We love people like this.  That's why people care in America.  American disasters.  We love it.  We love when Britney Spears is, like, crying and doing her drugs and driving into people and stuff.  American-raised disasters.  No, they're right there with Amy, too, man.  No way.  Hell yeah.  No way.  What would Tyler Durden do has Amy Winehouse stories?  That's not a UK site.  The TMZ has it.  Dude, she's huge, man. 
[00:47:00]  She's really-  She really is huge.  She won so many awards and stuff.  Because she's a mess.  I don't really care.  I don't care.  And her album was huge in the States.  Huge.  I don't see anyone giving a crap about this woman.  Hey, we-  Like, if she dropped dead, there would not be coverage like there was when, uh, that fat  friggin' blonde died.  What's her name?  Ah, you know, she had a kid that died, and then she died.  Oh, Anna Nicole Smith?  Anna Nicole.  That was, uh, that's a bigger story, obviously.  Yeah, but that's what I mean.  No one's gonna care when Amy Winehouse dies. 
[00:47:30]  Everyone will go, like, oh, yeah, of course.  All right.  Oh, she finally died?  Yeah, but it's not gonna be like when Joplin died, or Hendrix, or even-  Well, no, those were more talented artists.  Although, I will say, her version of to know him is to love him is really good.  You can't-  That made me a fan.  I-  Let me hear that.  I heard it.  I never wanted to like Amy Winehouse.  Never.  She's got a pretty cool voice, Anthony. 
[00:48:00]  I wouldn't go out and buy an Amy Winehouse CD.  Or download any of her music.  But when I hear it-  Oh, no, no, I'll hear it.  It's to love, love, love it.  You like some eclectic crap.  Dude, she's-  She's just good.  This is good.  Makes my heart hurt.  You listen to this and just cry?  No, but I-  It's on my iPod.  No!  You gotta say no.  No.  I didn't assume you could, I was.  But it's good. 
[00:48:30]  I don't like this.  I've heard better songs from her.  Really?  I don't think I've ever heard this one, actually, Jimmy.  It's not-  It's not bad, though.  That common.  She's slurring.  She's ripping off Lucinda Williams, but I think I might've went a little too deep for  the people out there.  She's just a mess, but-  Yeah, she is a wreck. 
[00:49:00]  Just that she's a train wreck.  Doesn't matter where you're from, we love watching train wrecks.  That's all.  All right, let's go to Chris and Philly.  I listen to more chick singers than I ever did now.  Go check out Lucinda Williams, then.  I never heard of her.  She's a-  Yeah, chick.  Huh?  She's a chick rocker.  He listens to you.  The lesbians love her.  No one by-  The lesbians love the lesbians of Williams.  What's a better song than Alicia Keys?  No one.  I challenge you.  I'll go with-  Damn it, is that a toe tapper?  Wow. 
[00:49:30]  I know.  Wait, which one?  Fruit.  I'm not!  You know, make sure Chris stands by, because we're going to  wrap up our death penalty bit with something Chris has.  It's a beautiful case that should have got the death penalty, but I want to hear this.  You've heard this, right?  Oh, no.  Give it time to kick in, Jimmy.  Oh, this bitch can belt out a tune.  Why would I have heard this?  She's like, it's all over the place.  I'm going to trump your song, by the way, in a second.  I just want you so-  You know this song?  You like whiny bitch songs.  No, this is a good one.  Something about you.  She's whining.  Jimmy likes hanging out in coffee shops. 
[00:50:00]  No!  You're one of those guys in a coffee shop with your laptop downloading this music.  Crying over a cup of joe.  Dude, I'm on LimeWire watching rape footage.  What are you talking about?  No.  I'm not a good person.  You're a complicated individual.  This is the other side of you that we're aware of.  This is a good song, by the way.  It's going to be all right.  Once again, I wouldn't download it, though.  Oh, did I?  Not only did I download it, I went on YouTube and watched her doing it live in Japan and somewhere  else.  Yeah, with that awful body of hers. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Is it?  Yeah.  Whose?  Alicia Keys.  Yeah, she's got the shape of a pear.  She looks like she's got a very pretty face.  Oh, yeah.  And stuff, but then you start going down and wow.  Well, she's an iceberg.  We all know the iceberg theory.  Yeah.  You see those girls at the bar, you're like, wow, wow, wow.  More below the surface.  Yeah.  Isn't she a New Jersey mess, too?  She's from Jersey or she lived in Jersey?  I don't know.  I don't know, Jim.  I feel allegiance to that. 
[00:51:00]  I'm a big fan of that Duffy song that hit about six months ago.  What?  The Duffy song.  It's kind of retro and everything.  Are you guys just going completely gay?  No.  No.  But iTunes lets you check something out before you buy it.  And then on YouTube, you can just watch little clips of people.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I went where my doors are gay.  I realize how it works.  Are you talking to Grandpa over here?  You mean it like that?  You know, they got this thing.  It's iTunes. 
[00:51:30]  You can preview the song.  I went with doors first.  And I'm just showing you the other side here a little bit.  Yeah.  I mean, you were a fan of No Doubt and Gwen Stefani, so you got to chill a little bit.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I went to the concert.  It's well documented that you went to a No Doubt show.  No, I went to the concert.  All right, hold on.  Let me enjoy my Duffy song for a second. 
[00:52:00]  This is the first time I'm ever hearing this, but it sounds just like Rehab, Amy Winehouse.  It's the same.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they're all kind of doing the same thing right now.  You've never heard this song?  Where am I going to hear this?  If you turn on a radio, this is a monster hit.  In New York radio, there's a station where I'm going to find this play?  Hell, yeah.  Probably more than one.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, then I'm under a rock somewhere.  This Duffy song was a monster, right?  What?  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  It was Song of the Year.  You guys introduced her at that big event.  We sure did.  At that corporate event, we even introduced her.  And I was like, who is she?  Song of the Year.  Song of the Year as per what?  England.  What?  In England.  In England.  Yeah.  So it's not Song of the Year as the Grammys.  No, but she was nominated.  This isn't huge.  This is a monster song.  No, it's not.  Oh, my God.  Get me some charts.  It's not a monster song.  This song was a monster.  I understand it might not be something you would listen to.  UK? 
[00:53:00]  UK monster?  No.  Monster.  Monster here in the United States.  Travis knows a little something about music.  How big was this song?  Very, very big.  Sam Obeck.  I got to say, look, I can't name you one Miley Cyrus song, whatever the hell her name is,  or Billy Ray Cyrus' kid.  Right.  But the hardest concert ticket to get is her.  Sam, Z100 had it.  Fresh had it.  There's E-Rock.  There's E-Rock posing with the chick.  E-Rock only poses with the biggies, right, E-Rock?  Yeah, right. 
[00:53:30]  She was that fresh, and the whole office filled up.  Like, all the salespeople came down to meet her.  She's very big.  Yeah, great.  They come down to see everybody.  Look, this is the time of year where they do all the hot songs of the year.  It's safe to say this would be way up on the charts as one of the biggest songs of the year 2008.  Not saying that we would, you know, jam to this every day, but there was an audience for this song.  She sold over 600,000 albums in America alone with minimal airplay on a lot of stations, but 600,000. 
[00:54:00]  Sure ain't the stations I'm listening to.  Oh, holy mother of Christ.  I don't know.  It's more like chick stations and pop stations.  This is a bitch song.  You know what song I went and got off the iPod, which I've got to be honest, I love.  Here we go again.  When you say that, I know it's going to be a good thing.  Feist.  Oh, one, two, three, four.  I'm a Feist.  I love Feist, one, two, three, four.  You know when I got turned on to that dumb song?  Ethel was playing it, and Alt Nation plays it.  I had never heard it on the radio.  Oh, my God.  Or the Mac commercial.  Yeah, giving me a little Feist. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, well, the Mac commercial made it popular, but it was a hit way before that.  We were goofing on these songs and going in and singing different lyrics, and this is  one of the ones I got to sing.  I'd never heard it.  You've heard this, right?  You guys are gay.  You guys have just completely made out.  You're out of touch.  If you want to continue dating the young broads, you've got to know this stuff. 
[00:55:00]  No, I don't.  They know they're Feist.  No, not the young broads.  They know they're Feist.  Listen to this, garbage.  I kind of like this one, too, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  Awesome.  One, two, three, four.  Yeah.  And then you guys are into the stupid Umbrella song.  No, I wasn't into the Umbrella song.  I like Jimmy was.  All right.  Well, then say Jimmy was.  Well, you seem to be pretty close on the young pig in these days.  I have no problem saying I kind of like the Duffy thing and the Feist one, two, three,  four.  That umbrella crap sucked.  I love me more, sleepless, long nights. 
[00:55:30]  That was what my youth was for.  I like this.  The edge ropes arrive at your door.  I never heard it.  Let's do with nothing, but they want some more.  That's good stuff.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, you're changing your heart.  Oh, oh, oh, you know who you are.  I forgot you redid that one, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ron in Michigan. 
[00:56:00]  Hello, Ron.  Hello.  You escaped a beating the other day.  Why?  What's your favorite Christmas song?  Oh, well, I forgot I even started that bit the other day.  Well, we were talking about favorite Christmas song, and I do have one that by far is my favorite  Christmas song, and I turn it up every time it's on the radio.  Uh, let's see.  Is it, uh, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe last night? 
[00:56:30]  No.  I'm classic Christmas song guy, because, you know, my dad was a bit older, and he had all  the records from back.  Records.  Back in the days, a lot of people like to say these days.  Christmas shoes.  So I'm like, uh, I'm, I'm a Burl Ives guy.  I'm a Bing Crosby guy.  Oh, oh.  I'm, uh, like, uh, uh, I don't know if Perry Como did any Christmas songs, but, man, did  my dad love that Perry Como guy. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  Perry Como.  Perry.  Perry.  Como.  Como.  Uh.  Uh.  Fyce is like the new Bajork, people are saying.  Bajork.  Never, never liked Bajork.  Uh.  Like her big hit with the big teddy bear chasing her through the woods in the video.  Yeah.  I like the Bajork fan who really shows us what Bajork fans should do.  Painting his head.  Why would you kill yourself over Bajork?  What's wrong with you?  This was one of Bajork's big hits. 
[00:57:30]  Never got the Bajork on any level.  Bajork, thumbs up?  Uh, no, I, I, I just was never into Bajork.  But it was weird because the time she was popular, it kind of fit.  Uh, you know, so I don't think it was considered as faggy as the chick songs now. 
[00:58:00]  Like Alanis Morissette and stuff back then, that was during the whole grunge thing, so it  kind of fit.  It was just grunge chicks or, you know, alt chicks.  Now, it's rock and faggy chick music.  I think we played Alanis Morissette when we were rocking Boston at AF.  I Oughta Know is just a ridiculous song.  Yeah, there were, there were things like that.  The first few times you heard it.  Yeah, that's what I, I mean, like that, that fit for the time, especially. 
[00:58:30]  But now, you're not getting like, you're not getting like rock chick, you're getting,  yeah, like Z100 chick music.  Well, the music has gotten.  Where it's like prepubescent girl music.  A lot of the music's gotten certainly wimpier.  Yeah.  Definitely wimpier, but Bajork, would you?  Would you, would you, would you, would you the Bajork?  When she first came out, she was kind of a weird Nordic looking thing.  A Nordic nymph?  Nymph.  A Nordic nymph. 
[00:59:00]  Let's introduce you to Bajork.  People want us to go to a break and reset.  They're bothered by this break.  Wow.  They're bothered by this.  They all do it.  Everyone has a bad, bad, bad love.  Hell, hell effing, yeah.  It's very easy to go, I love Metallica and Zeppelin and the Doors.  I can do that until I'm blue in the face.  But there are other things you get into a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  I hope you know.  I hope you know. 
[00:59:30]  What to do with you.  It's personal.  Look, dude.  I was going for something here.  I failed miserably.  Can you turn this off?  I need them out to do.  Rock him.  I like this version.  I miss you.  I miss you.  They're playing it.  But I gotta get a move on with my life.  It's time to be a big girl now.  It's time to be a big girl now.  Yeah, big girls don't cry. 
[01:00:00]  Don't cry.  All right, you can turn it off now.  Don't cry.  I will acknowledge I failed miserably with this on every single possible level.  It was a total success.  Being ironic, being serious, being funny.  I failed on all those levels.  Every single one of them.  You don't think I know this crap?  Oh, my God.  Did you ever sing one of those for us, Ant?  No, I never did.  Yeah, we all were singing pop songs for a while.  I think you should do one.  It wouldn't be as funny with Ant, because Ant can really sing. 
[01:00:30]  I'll F it up on purpose.  I'll put on a wacky voice.  Oh, by the way, I wasn't doing it on purpose either.  Oh, really?  No, I was just...  You were going for it.  I was going for many different things.  You were going...  It failed across the board.  Here's intern David.  Hello, this is David Freed recording Katy Perry's Hot and Cold, take number one.  We've got to bring back this bit, the boys singing the pop songs of the day.  You change your mind like a girl changes clothes. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, you PMS like a chick I would know.  And you always think, always speak cryptically.  I should know that you're no good for me.  Because you're hot, then you're cold.  You're yes, then you're no.  You're in, then you're out.  You're up, then you're down.  You're wrong when it's right. 
[01:01:30]  It's black, and it's white.  We fight, we break up.  We kiss, we make up.  You, you don't really want to stay, no.  All right, enough.  Can we have him sing that on the Gaza Strip and see what happens to him?  I was trying to remember another song that I like that'll throw me right back under the bus.  You've got to play along here, Anthony.  Yeah?  Your music choices are very safe.  You've got to tell us something that you like that you're not willing to admit.  There's some, you know, fruity songs. 
[01:02:00]  Brandon Janes from O-Town, brother.  This is the one I was trying to think of.  The band is Ting Ting.  You know what?  I got fruity songs, but I'd never, ever try to say that it's good or popular with, you know.  What is one you like people at?  No, we're looking for just newer songs that people would be surprised you kind of like.  Because we all have the satellite radio, so you get a lot more music choices.  So you're finding stuff you probably wouldn't find on regular radio. 
[01:02:30]  Because it just hits you.  Like music, it's a weird thing.  Like all of a sudden it just kind of moves you in a weird way.  And you're like, yeah, why'd that one get me?  Yeah, not on like Octane.  No, I listen to Octane.  It's easy to say you listen to Octane.  But I also go and listen to other channels.  I'm not going to go to some fruit friggin' chick crap channel.  Well, the song I'm talking about, hold on.  The song I'm talking about isn't on one of those fruit channels.  It's on Alt Nation.  Which Ting Ting song?  Not My Name.  That's a great song. 
[01:03:00]  That whole album is fantastic.  Look at, he goes, which Ting Ting song?  See, I go a little deeper.  He goes real deep.  I don't know any other Ting Ting songs.  I've only got one album.  You are so gay, Travis.  Listen to this song.  I do like this.  And it comes up on Alt Nation.  I go to an alt channel.  Oh, a lot of kick-down. 
[01:03:30]  Wait for the hook.  I'm just saying there's this retro thing going on.  There's this 30s, 40s retro thing with these chicks these days.  Like Tony Basil for the year 2008.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Oh, Mickey, you're so fine.  You're so fine.  You're on my mind.  Hey, Mickey.  They're just kind of redoing the sound of the 80s. 
[01:04:00]  I kind of like that.  That's just it.  I kind of like catchy songs at times.  That's all.  There you go.  I do like that one.  What song was I listening to?  I like it.  And my ex-girlfriend.  I love going back to Jimmy.  My ex-girlfriend told me.  Oh, boy.  That's how he prefaced them.  No, it was some song of, oh, it was, you can buy me a drink. 
[01:04:30]  It was like, you know, some chick.  Buy me a drink.  A drink?  A drink.  How does that one go?  What?  It might not be it.  Was it T-Pain?  Because my ex-girlfriend told me that I had the type of musical taste.  She's like, you should be going out with a bunch of your fat girlfriends whooping it  up in the car.  Yes.  That's the type of music I was enjoying.  Yes.  Me and a bunch of fat chicks just laughing.  Woo, we're going to go out tonight, girls.  Woo.  You and a bunch of fat chicks searching out an 80s night. 
[01:05:00]  We'll buy you a drink from T-Pain.  T-Pain?  Yeah.  How's it go?  T-Pain.  It's kind of a hip-hop rap thing, and I really can't deliver that.  That's not it.  No?  It's not hip-hop?  No.  No.  Now we're playing stuff off laptops.  That's the point we've gotten to.  All right.  We'll take a break.  And you've got to admit, Juan, come on.  After the break.  I'm trying to think.  I'm absolutely trying to think.  Why are you always playing it safe?  I'm not playing it safe.  What about?  If I had one, I would blurt it out. 
[01:05:30]  What about, yeah, MIA's another good one.  Paper Planes.  Is that with the gunshots?  You should like this one.  It has gunshots in it.  I remember this one.  This one was catchy.  This one you should like, because it has the gunshots.  I remember it being catchy.  Pineapple Express killed that song, though, because it was on every single commercial.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Really?  You got the gunshot one.  Is this the way you're talking about?  I'm not sure.  Is this paper?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You should like this. 
[01:06:00]  It has gunshots.  I know this song.  Let's start here.  I've heard this song.  This is a Clash riff that she took.  It's getting to the hook. 
[01:06:30]  I never heard it.  Relax, everyone.  This song was huge, Jamie.  I never heard this.  Huge the past year.  Maybe a little longer, even.  It's no 99 Luftballons.  Where's she from?  She's from England.  Yeah.  Here we go.  There you go.  Yeah, I remember that. 
[01:07:00]  I definitely heard that.  Yeah.  Well, I'll unveil my favorite Christmas song after the break.  Brand new Bananarama right there.  A little Bananarama-ish.  That was a brand new Bananarama.  And we're going to talk about the death map after the break, too.  What?  Yeah, the death map.  It's a little quiz for you, Ant, so don't cheat with your pal talk friends today.  No, no, no.  We like challenging your knowledge. 
[01:07:30]  This is what you have to try to figure out during the break.  Mm-hmm.  Where are you most likely to die, and from what, in the United States of America as far  as natural hazards go, or natural causes?  Natural causes?  No, no, no, no.  Natural?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, huh?  Disasters, yes.  Natural disasters.  Oh, natural disasters.  Like, when you think natural disasters, earthquake.  I'm thinking earthquake, hurricane, tornado, things like that. 
[01:08:00]  Things like that.  Okay.  What's the number one natural disaster that kills people in the United States?  Okay.  And where is the most, like, hazardous place to live in the United States of America as  far as natural, uh, uh, disasters go?  All right.  Do not cheat with your pal talk.  I'm not even looking.  Actually, I'm pulling the screen down.  Ooh, that's going to be tough for you.  Now I can't see them.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, starring Jim Norton. 
[01:08:30]  He's doing a New Year's Eve show, right, Jimmy?  I am, yeah.  It's in, uh, Allentown, PA, Crocodile Rock.  But the big thing I have to announce is the Borgata second show sold out.  First one almost sold out.  The January 18th, the third show is being added.  Tomorrow, tickets go on sale at 10 a.m.  Um, it sold out last year, and hopefully that third show will sell out this year, too.  Of course it will.  Where were we?  We can move on from, uh...  Game music that we all love.  Well...  Disasters.  Natural disasters.  Oh, okay.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  You made a good comment about all that music we just played.  It's like suicide music.  Yeah, all that suicide chick music.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, what is this now?  The, uh, country...  Well, it came up with what's called a death map.  The death map.  Ooh.  Yeah, natural disasters.  You know, those things take out...  We've got a bunch of people every year.  So we're looking for, like, the number one natural disaster.  The most likely way you would die from a natural disaster. 
[01:09:30]  I would have to say...  And do I have to pick the area of the country?  Or is this just...  Yeah.  ...a single, one-part question?  You can do either one.  I don't think you're going to get it unless you're cheated.  No, I didn't cheat.  I swear.  Okay.  I would imagine, though, that it is flooding, and it is, uh, in the south.  Flooding is the, uh, number one natural disaster that people die from.  Hey!  No, I'm asking you.  Oh.  You know how they reiterate?  I thought you just gave me the, uh, the wind. 
[01:10:00]  I was just reiterating.  Damn.  Knowing that you were wrong, by the way.  Damn it.  Damn, I thought I had it.  I hate when they do that on game shows.  They reiterate.  You sit there, like, all hoping.  Yeah.  Um.  Wow.  Heat.  Heat?  Yes.  I was just going to say heat.  Maine.  In Maine.  You're right, Jim.  Death map shows heat a big hazard to Americans. 
[01:10:30]  In the American southwest.  Heat.  Yeah, well, heat is more likely to kill an American  than an earthquake.  Uh, and thunderstorms kill more than hurricanes.  Did you know that?  Thunderstorms.  Yeah.  Thunderstorms kill more people than hurricanes.  Oh, hell yeah.  They're, uh, a lot more, uh, frequent.  Heat and drought cause 19.6% of total deaths from natural hazards.  Mm.  With summer, uh, thunderstorms, uh, coming in second place.  18.8%.  And winter weather causing 18.1%. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  But it all comes down to that heat.  Who would think?  Heat is still killing people in the year 2008?  Yeah.  What's wrong with people out there?  Earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes, those are the ones the news obviously over-report  on.  Combined, we're responsible for fewer than 5% of all hazard deaths.  So they make a big to-do about it on the news, but it's really, those things aren't  really killing people like heat does.  Yeah, hurricanes are kind of like, hey, look out. 
[01:11:30]  In three days, here it comes.  Yeah.  So they kind of, you know, give you some good warning.  And they also learn that California is relatively safe to live.  As far as natural disasters go.  Yeah.  Until the big one hits.  Until it cracks off.  We've always heard about the big one.  Enough with the big one.  It ain't gonna happen.  Not in our lifetime.  You know, California's gonna crack off and, you know.  Yeah.  Unless, of course, Lex Luthor fires a nuclear missile into the San Andreas Fault, thus making 
[01:12:00]  Arizona a very expensive beachfront property.  Arizona Bay, my friend.  Yes.  The great Bill Hicks.  Oh, yeah.  Came up with Arizona Bay.  I'm quoting more Lex Luthor.  I was going with Bill Hicks.  Superman in the movie.  Yes.  All right, where else were we?  We've got to talk about the woman with the, yeah, I am stammering on purpose.  Oh.  Because this story is like, wow.  Yeah, I've been watching some news on this and the information. 
[01:12:30]  You must be talking about the woman.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  With dead person face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd rather have no face.  I was really thinking about this.  No face?  Yeah.  Than dead person face?  Yeah.  Because I, I don't, how do you look yourself in the mirror and look at like somebody else?  That would creep me out.  At least like if I had no face, but I sort of maybe had some kind of, kind of eye still.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, yeah, that's me.  That's me and my face destroyed.  But to look in the mirror and, and, and have someone else's face, I don't know how you live 
[01:13:00]  with yourself.  That is like a living, that's a living nightmare.  They, they do say that you don't look like the donor, but you don't look like yourself either  because you're, you're pulling the face over your own bone structure.  Sure.  So it's different than what the person looked like, but it's also different from what you  look like.  Right.  And I would gather if you have a gravely disfiguring, uh, injury to your face, that, uh, it would  be an option.  Although you got to take those rejection drugs for the rest of your life. 
[01:13:30]  And if those don't take your face to what rots off.  I would be now you're just there with a rot face.  I would be Halloween mask guy.  I would just be known as Halloween mask guy.  You just wear that little thing.  My kid.  Something.  Yeah.  My kid.  My friend.  Jimmy, would you go with a dab of perfume behind your rotting ear?  Hello, my name is John Burke.  Very pleased to meet you. 
[01:14:00]  Grab a whore and try to make him kiss.  That's the funniest part.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Oh, the elephant man, he's all dolled up and they're just shoving a hooker's face in  his and she's going, ah, and he's going, ah, it's fantastic.  We get that scene.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Ah.  Oh, that's funny.  When they gave him the shaving kit.  My kid.  It's beautiful.  It takes a stupid comb for those three Homer Simpson wisps that he's trying to brush on 
[01:14:30]  that big, lumpy moon crater head.  He should have just hired somebody on a ladder to get back there and rake it.  The elephant man's head was abominable.  Here's your kit.  It's a shotgun.  You'll comb your hair.  Old Mount Rushmore head.  Jesus.  How are you going to get laid with that big, dumb head?  Jimmy, would you go with the face transplant?  Um, I don't know, man.  It's, to me, I would, like, what if, what if it started to rot and you could smell under 
[01:15:00]  the skin on your face?  Like, just because it's so close.  Wow.  Like a healing, you know that scab smell, a healing wound?  What if it smelled like that?  Yeah, yeah, that's.  I don't know.  I mean, obviously the option of a dog, because the dogs ate her face.  So that would be, yeah, kind of hard to live with, too.  Well, that was the first one that happened, right?  That face transplant?  Yeah.  Now, this one is, um, here in the United States.  When did Jack Osborne decide to intern for our show? 
[01:15:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Wait a minute.  You can't run out.  We're asking.  We're saying hi real quick.  Wow.  You kind of look like a younger, fatter, like Jack Osborne.  Thank you very much.  I'm sure you've been told that, though.  Well, dude, sometimes.  By you once, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, two weeks ago.  Oh.  Two weeks ago.  I don't even remember telling you that.  You've been here for two weeks?  No, today's my first day when I came for my interview.  Oh.  Welcome aboard.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Welcome.  What are you doing?  What are you, uh, you know, aspiring to? 
[01:16:00]  To do this job one day.  Yeah, like on air?  Yeah.  Going on air, not this behind-the-scenes crap?  No.  So what are you learning?  Anything?  Giving you crap back there or anything?  No, everybody's been nice to me so far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, you're the lucky one.  Uh, starting today, we're not allowed to do crazy stuff with interns, so.  Oh, thank you.  Is that, is that.  So enjoy, enjoy your internship.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a company that doesn't understand what we do, so you're safe from doing anything  crazy.  What's your name?  Mason Reese.  What? 
[01:16:30]  Mason Reese.  Old reference.  I got the Mason Reese.  It's an old reference.  I got the Mason Reese.  The Underwood Deviled Ham commercial, kid.  Sure.  Wow.  Ah, look it up on the internet.  Um, Matt.  Okay.  Matt.  Yes.  And where do you reside?  Uh, Brooklyn.  Hopefully Brooklyn.  Matt from Brooklyn.  Yeah, we gotta update our reference.  Definitely a Seth Rogen going on.  Definitely a Seth Rogen.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I mean, Jonah Hill.  Sorry, sorry.  Jonah Hill. 
[01:17:00]  I've been called that by many a drunk person while wandering the village.  Really?  Yeah.  Why are you wandering the village?  Yeah, what's going on?  It was Halloween.  Oh, well, of course.  Nobody loves it.  There's a, yeah.  Your odds are better on Halloween, my friend.  Something you want to tell us?  Mm-hmm.  No, Homer.  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  See, that's much better than having the interns do crazy stuff, right?  Right human resources.  Die!  So what about, um, what about the, uh... 
[01:17:30]  Face transplant?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's get back to that.  Uh, here's the story that's creeping everybody out today.  Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic have performed the first ever full face transplant.  That woman had suffered injuries so severe she couldn't even go out in public.  This is not the first face transplant.  Actually, there have been four, but this is the first done in the United States, and by  far the most, uh, extensive, about 80% of our face is new.  Uh, imagine having an accident and a horribly deformed face to the point where you can't go 
[01:18:00]  out of the house.  You become a social outcast.  And then one day you wake up with a new face and a new chance at life.  Doctors are handling the first full face transplant in the U.S. a success.  This procedure went well according to the plan, and the patient is doing well.  We took a Jew.  Clinic.  Wah!  That's the first one ever?  All right.  What's that?  You've got to get these pictures up on onaradio.com, because there's been about four of these,  and, uh, the first one is horrific. 
[01:18:30]  They're getting a little better every, every time.  What is that?  What is that?  You want to become Wayne Williams, the Atlantic child killer?  You know what I love about it?  They almost figured out the face transplant, but they couldn't figure out how to put the  glasses back on the head, uh, without it looking crooked.  Oh, that one was first.  Oh.  Yeah, this is the first one.  So she looked like that, and then she looked like that?  Yeah.  Was she white to start with?  Uh, or black?  Light skin, uh, light skin, uh, black.  Because that would be funny.  Light skin black.  That would be a fun gag to play on somebody, if they were white, and then you gave them a 
[01:19:00]  new face, but it was a black person's face.  That would be a fun gag to play on someone I can look at right now, actually.  Yeah, well, that would be hilarious.  Talking about some kind of science fiction movie.  This is like face-off, that movie.  And then they did something with that.  We'll get all this up on the website.  I don't know.  Would someone throw a drill press at her?  It's like the nose, half the nose, and, uh, and half the mustache area, and, uh, half  a cheek.  Gone.  Like, what happened to these people, Dan?  They don't say? 
[01:19:30]  Uh, no, I'm just on images right now.  I'll try and find out.  Oh, yeah.  All right, um...  The medical team at the Cleveland Clinic replaced 80% of a woman's face, using skin,  nerves, muscle, and tissue from a donor who died.  Who died?  They have to say that?  Yeah, right?  Someone walked around with an out-of-face.  I just figured I'd be a good guy.  I want to be a good Samaritan.  You know, it was the holiday season.  You know, I figured it was about time to give back.  Spirit of giving.  Yeah, I have him peel my face off. 
[01:20:00]  Like a glove.  This one that we were...  Yes, son?  The one that we were just looking at, uh, it's an Asian gentleman, uh, with half his  face ripped off.  That was actually, he was a victim of a bear attack.  Oh!  Whoa.  And if you remember the...  I was very angry that day.  And, uh, this was the first one that they did.  This was, uh...  That's the first one, really?  Yeah, that was the one I think she had...  That's the famous one.  Yeah, her face was eaten off by a dog.  Yeah, the blonde, uh, broad with the, you know, the...  She passed out.  She was passed out and woke up to her dog, uh... 
[01:20:30]  Eating her face.  You have a few drinks, uh, you pass out, and your dog eats your face.  Nice.  She looks pretty good nowadays, though.  She looks better, man.  Still.  Knowing that it's someone else's face on.  Yeah, she looks like a lady dye.  Yeah.  Here's the second half of the story.  All we know about the patient is that she was horribly disfigured.  Missing parts of her face, including one eye, her nose, and upper lip.  Her name and the reason for her surgery is confidential.  Putting a patient through this type of surgery, uh, includes tremendous lifelong risks. 
[01:21:00]  It's possible the body could reject the new face at any time.  But for some, it's the only option.  You need the face to face the world.  Now, this new face is not just a mask.  The nerves, muscles, tendons, they all work.  This woman can now blink her eyes.  She can smell and taste all things that she was not able to do before the surgery.  And since the underlying bones were not replaced, the patient actually looks more like herself than the donor. 
[01:21:30]  No, no, no.  She wasn't able to smell.  Now she's smelling what the dead guy used to smell.  Or the dead girl or whatever.  Dead woman.  The dead woman smell?  Uh, I...  Wow.  Hey, that picture you showed, Danny, is that real?  I don't know.  I was trying to figure it out.  They're holding up, like, what is a, uh...  No way.  All right, all right.  No, that's too much...  They're showing, like, what the face would look like before you transplant it. 
[01:22:00]  That's crazy.  It's just a...  It's just like a...  Like a...  It looks like the...  It looks like the Scarecrow's face.  Yeah.  From the Wizard of Oz.  Looks like the Evil Dead special packaging.  Yes, that's it.  The Necromonicon.  Yeah.  We get everything out there, Stunt Brain, on this one?  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty, uh, creepy, though.  Oh.  Two surgical teams, a harvesting team, and a transplant team, performed the transplant.  Harvest.  The harvesting team. 
[01:22:30]  Time to harvest the face.  Yeah.  That's just like harvesting, uh, you know, hair from the back of your head, right?  Follicles.  My follicles.  Mm.  They needed five hours to harvest the face.  Five hours to cut a face off?  Yep.  That's got to be a rough operation.  And then they chill the facial tissue.  At 40 degrees is the, uh, the, uh, the proper temperature, yes.  40 degrees keeps a face?  Yeah.  Keeps it for six hours.  Freezer burn?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:23:00]  And then, then the, uh, surgery itself took 12 hours.  12 hours to put the face back on?  Yeah.  What about, like, is it the same doctors?  No.  What do they do?  They, like, go in shifts or something?  Yeah.  It's like, all right, here, I'm leaving you with this mess.  I'm going to sleep.  Yeah.  I don't like when your shift is over at your job.  All right.  Punch out.  And then you explain what you left them with.  Well, you know, this package has to go out and, uh, blah, blah's looking for this.  Got the face off.  It's on ice.  Right.  There you go.  Ah, sew it on.  Yeah.  Finish the year. 
[01:23:30]  Good luck to you.  Finish it up.  They should use the same thing.  Remember this was Doubtfire?  Yes.  Why not use that same masking technology?  Just put that on, like, prosthetics that they use in the movies.  That's not a bad idea.  Then you walk around like that.  It'd be a pain in the ass to go sit in a makeup chair for 10 hours a day just to do errands.  Yeah.  Why are they showing the water skiing squirrel again?  Boat show.  Boat show is in New York.  Oh, okay.  So, this poor thing.  It's not water skiing.  I just want to shoot it. 
[01:24:00]  Look, it's drowning now is what it's doing.  No, the squirrel figured out, well, if I hold on to this thing, I won't do it.  I won't drown.  I won't drown.  See, to us dummies, we think it's water skiing.  No, it's just trying to survive.  That poor squirrel just wants out of that pool.  Yeah.  And people are lining up to watch this thing.  Were squirrels driving the boat that was pulling it?  It kind of looked like it.  Maybe.  I know the squirrel that doesn't want to, you know, drown, so it just sits in the boat.  Yeah.  As it goes round and round. 
[01:24:30]  We, as humans, are just, we still love things like freak shows and gladiators and whatever else.  Just show us a freak show, some violence, faces being ripped off.  I don't care.  Whatever.  We love it.  Okay.  Such a brutal things we are.  We're going to go back in a break because we've got to catch up.  Jack Cafferty had a great rant on that guy you hate, Jimmy.  We all hate him, but the $50 billion guy that took everyone's investments.  Lance Cafferty is just a grumpy old F, but, man, he makes some good points. 
[01:25:00]  He is a grouch.  He's certainly a grouch.  He's like your grouchy neighbor you always avoid.  Ah, shaking his fist.  Get off my arm.  Are you?  Yeah.  Why?  He is a grouch.  I don't know what makes that guy happy, but he's got a good little rant on that Madoff guy.  He probably likes Marv Albert-like sex, like a dress and biting someone.  He's probably a real kinkster.  Kinkster.  A kinkster.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:25:30]  You're checking out Opie and Anthony, and we appreciate that.  Christmas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I have kids, though, Christmas, yay.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, Christmas.  Yeah.  I kind of like it.  My house is very Christmassy, and I like that.  I am turning on the Christmas songs every night, though, for a little while.  Where's all the Christmas specials, though?  I can't find them on TV.  I want to go old school. 
[01:26:00]  I want to see the Frosty.  I don't think they do.  I think you've got to buy them on DVD now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Rudolph was the other week, and Frosty, and a lot of them are on those family channels.  You know, stupid me, I was looking at my cable bill.  I'm up to $150 a month.  I have TVs pretty much everywhere, right?  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, okay, I rarely go to Showtime and the movie channel and what not.  If I'm going to go see a movie, I'll do movies on demand like anyone else.  But I'm thinking to myself, Christmas, Christmas movies, I pay $150 a month, HBO, Showtime, 
[01:26:30]  one of these certainly has to have a little section called holiday favorites or holiday  movies, right?  Yeah.  No.  Nothing.  Why not?  Why the F not?  We're paying for your service.  It's the Christmas season.  Give me a whole bunch of holiday movies I could choose from.  Well, I'd like to know why.  What is that about? 
[01:27:00]  I'd like to know why from channel 200 to channel 300 is all Spanish language programming.  Yeah, no kidding.  And I can't dump it.  No kidding.  I can't just ditch that.  And pay less.  No kidding.  I got to just blast right through the 200s.  Yep.  But there is a reason.  Somehow they want you to buy the movies on DVD every year or something.  Yeah, that's pretty much it now.  What is it?  What is it?  What do you want from us now?  They want you to buy Rudolph and keep it in your little DVD collection. 
[01:27:30]  Because I lost my Bad Santa.  I lost my Christmas Vacation.  And those are two movies I just want to see because it's that time of year.  Yeah.  So I'm like, I don't know where you buy DVDs anymore.  I really don't.  Especially in Manhattan.  So I'm like, it's got to be part of my cable package somewhere where I can find these movies.  Yeah.  Hell no.  They just, they just, they just, every chance they get.  Yeah.  It's like, give me a break. 
[01:28:00]  We're paying enough for cable.  Give me some holiday movies.  That's all I ask.  I like digital delivery now.  That's it, man.  Netflix has it going on through my Xbox.  Uh-huh.  I could just go on there, go online.  You queue up your movies, the ones that are available immediately.  Yeah.  And you just watch them right there on your TV, streamed.  They got to get more movies, obviously.  I guess they're working on that.  Then there's the other one, the system that I'm having put in, which is another download delivery system. 
[01:28:30]  I'm not going to have DVDs anymore.  No.  They're useless to have around the house.  I, uh, uh, having a lot of stuff taken out of my basement since they were doing some work down there.  And, uh, boxes with videotapes, what are they called?  Videotapes.  VHS tapes?  Yeah, VHS tapes.  I got rid of those a long time ago.  Dude, like, of, not just ones that I took with a camcorder of, you know, an event or something like that.  Yeah, I know.  Movies.  Movies.  Yeah.  Like, like, like Star Trek, the box set, which is, it could fill a room. 
[01:29:00]  Ridiculous.  Yeah, I'd probably never know those.  And now there's no reason.  There's no reason for this.  Just digital delivery for everything would be fantastic.  First run movies, do it that way.  They could charge people twice the amount that they charge in the movie theater, at least.  And people would download it to watch it at their house.  They'd have a problem with bootlegging, I think. 
[01:29:30]  But there's got to be a way around that, where you're not getting that quality copy.  There's some kind of scrambling.  Yeah.  There's got to be some way that, all right, here's a movie.  It's released in the theaters.  I don't want to go to the theater.  I want to see it in my house.  I download it.  I pay, you know, a lot more than I would go into the movies.  They make some money.  And you get to watch the movie like that.  There's no reason why you have to go to a movie theater anymore.  No.  There's a market for people that want to stay home, would pay the extra. 
[01:30:00]  You're right.  I think this is why they won't do it, because they won't get repeat business, because people  will find a way to bootleg it.  And you don't know how many people will be watching it when you download it.  So usually you're paying double.  You get six people watching it, or the whole family, instead of going to pay for it.  Yeah, that's true.  There's got to be a business model.  Dude, would you pay $100 to see a movie that's in the movie theaters?  No.  No way.  I wouldn't pay $100.  What's your price, though?  My price, I would pay... 
[01:30:30]  I mean, movies are what?  $11, $12 right now.  I'd pay $20.  That's it?  I'd go higher than that, to be able to stay home on a Friday and watch something that's  in theaters?  Yeah.  Maybe $100 is a bit high, but I'd...  You pay, like, for pay-per-view, you pay, you know, sometimes you pay, how much for a fight?  It was like $50 or something for a Tyson fight, things like that.  But for a movie, you know, what do they charge you in a hotel?  It's like $14 or something for a movie in a hotel.  Right.  That's a good deal.  See, they have regular movies in hotels, Jim, which are actually movies that are still in 
[01:31:00]  theaters and stuff.  I know, I know.  I remember seeing Lesbian Housewives in theaters.  Nice.  Cravings was a good one.  Was that all?  I could only imagine what that was about.  Dark Cravings was good, but I didn't care for the lighting.  It really messed things up.  It just didn't look right.  Did it?  Yeah.  Boo.  I love boo.  You know, it was another good movie.  You should have quit while I was a head.  But I went on Netflix and got Eraserhead because I wanted to see that. 
[01:31:30]  I hadn't seen that in years.  And, you know, you just download it and it streams.  You watch it.  It's great quality.  I'm going to start doing that because enough.  And I'm getting rid of my cable.  The cable is useless.  All those movie channels are useless.  I'll never get rid of cable because, you know, I'm one of those suckers.  And they don't let you just get rid of some of it.  Yeah, you can't get rid of some of it.  You have to get rid of major chunks of it.  And I love, you know, the History Channel and Military Channel, Discovery, all those. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, your choice is you could have 600 channels or seven.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All I watch on cable is the movie channels, which is like from 300 to, you know, 380 or whatever it is.  And then Discovery, History, things like that.  And, God, that's like about it.  The high def, on demand, any of the on demand movie things, I'll buy one of those every so often. 
[01:32:30]  But any network television I haven't watched, and I can't even tell you how long.  If there's some news event happening, I'll turn on Fox or CNN.  Other than that, every other channel is a waste.  Out of the 1,000 channels, I think, that are on there, I probably watch 20 channels at most.  Yeah, of course.  But we're paying for it.  Yeah.  We don't pay for all of them.  I was looking for someone to watch last night. 
[01:33:00]  I went really obscure.  Remember, MSG Classic, I watched Game 4 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, Rangers and Flyers.  And the only reason, because they preface it by saying it was one of the bloodiest series ever.  Oh, really?  Old school hockey at its best.  The opening face-off, Ed Giacomo, who was the old goalie for the Rangers, gets knocked out.  Gets knocked out in the goal crease.  Because someone from the Flyers stepped on his head with his skate. 
[01:33:30]  They take the old time mask off Ed Giacomo.  He's got a head full of gray hair.  Remember when athletes had real gray hair?  Not like this Brett Favre that has a little something, something going on.  But it was like they kept their hair still a little long, and it was just gray.  Like, how old is this guy?  Probably wasn't even 40, you know?  And it was just awesome.  Flights.  Dave Schultz were the old-timers out there.  Nice gloves just being thrown to the ice. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  They start swinging, shirts being pulled over the hair, jerseys.  They called the Flyers back then the Furious Flyers because teams were scared to play the Flyers.  Wow.  They were telling a story because in between the action, they kind of like it's more current.  Yeah.  And they kind of talk about the game.  And one of the guys was saying when these guys showed up at hotels, people scattered.  They didn't want to deal with them on the ice, off the ice.  They were just animals.  And I shouldn't like the Flyers because I'm an Islander fan. 
[01:34:30]  But I just love old-time hockey.  I love the guys that used to fight.  I love the blood and guts, all that crap.  That's a – I like watching that classic –  Oh, Ed Jockman.  I'm sorry, Steven S.  Yeah, Ed Jockman, I mispronounced his name.  The classic ESPN and stuff.  Yeah.  Some of those classics.  Oh, yeah.  Some of them are like, you know, I wouldn't watch that.  Who's going to watch a baseball game from, you know, 30 years ago?  But hockey would be something, yeah, because, you know, the old school fighting and everything  is fantastic.  I found a hockey – they rarely do this one.  I found a hockey game from – it had to be the 50s where they didn't have the plexiglass. 
[01:35:00]  It was like chain-link fence.  And this was the NHL.  Chain-link fence.  And, of course, the famous goalies without the mask.  They just couldn't figure out that they needed masks.  Maybe you should put a mask on.  Right.  They just couldn't figure that one out.  Just take one to the face.  But you've got to remember, before the new technology, they had to figure out how to  prevent the, you know, the pucks from knocking people's teeth out every other second.  Yeah.  All the hockey players had no teeth.  They went with something that looked like chain-link fence. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  They were thinking something.  And the hockey action – I swear to God, it was, like I said, 1974.  It looked like an old-timers game.  Really?  Like they were moving so slow on the ice.  You're like, what?  Yeah.  They were looked at as great athletes and they could skate and stuff.  They looked like they couldn't turn on their skates.  You know what I mean?  That's something.  It's all new, like, training and what they've learned from the past.  And now they're, like, yeah, superhuman out there compared to those days.  I forgot how great it was to just watch old-school hockey. 
[01:36:00]  You know what else is cool to watch on there?  I watched an episode of The Old Wide World of Sports.  Yeah.  And you watch what qualified as sports back then.  It was ridiculous.  There was a stadium full of people.  Dude, a stadium in Los Angeles to watch a Frisbee competition.  Frisbee.  Really?  Yeah.  And then people were, like – they packed the place. 
[01:36:30]  In their tiny little shorts.  Oh, little disgusting 70s shorts.  They jump up for the Frisbee and something drops.  They all look like the kids from Jaws 2.  Right.  Yeah, that's a good one.  They jump up for the Frisbee and the dog jumps up for what he sees.  Yeah.  Pop it out.  Yeah, he thinks he sees a little treat.  Right.  Yeah, but that was, like – and they're covering it like a sporting event.  Yeah.  It's like, here we are, Wide World of Sports here, Los Angeles, Coliseum, watching the Frisbee Nationals. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Frisbee?  They had national teams?  It was like – no, it was individual guys.  And their dogs.  They had, like, a dog competition.  We could have a little dog with a bandana tied around his neck, man.  And he would do all Frisbee tricks, and the crowd's just going crazy.  Thank God for the Internet, because we lived boring lives.  That's what I was thinking.  Thank God for the Internet.  How bored do you have to be to go, honey, I got tickets to a Frisbee event. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Why don't we go down there?  I hear the Wide World of Sports is covering it.  I'm being called out.  They did say Furious Flyers last night, because some people are saying the Broad Street Bullies.  But this person they were interviewing said they were also known as the Furious Flyers, because they were just ridiculous.  Well, I have to search that out.  Yeah.  Those are some fun ones.  Old boxing, too, is good to watch.  Hell yeah.  On that.  Hell yeah.  See that old boxing when they weren't just clenching, and, you know, they were really just toe-to-toe beating the crap out of each other. 
[01:38:00]  Watch old Tyson fights, man, when they pop on.  Oh, my God.  It's great.  Fantastic.  He was an animal.  Yeah.  Hey, really quick, a speed round.  Remember that tile falling off the tunnel up there in Boston?  Oh, yeah.  Killing that lady, I believe.  Crushed the car, yeah.  That part of the big dig thing?  The family got $16 million.  That thing is finally over.  $16 million, huh?  That was a story we brought you a while ago.  Well, they put a price tag on somebody.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you figure that one out? 
[01:38:30]  The supermarket that refused to make the Hitler cake defends itself.  That story still has legs.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, they're like, look, we're just not making the Hitler cake.  Why?  They just don't want to.  The kid's name.  They just don't want to.  Adolf Hitler Campbell.  Did you see the kid?  He's adorable.  He is adorable.  Little Hitler.  He's going to have a rough life with a name like Adolf Hitler.  Oh.  And then there was another thing worth mentioning here.  Oh, the smoking gun.  This is more of a visual, but go to the smoking gun. 
[01:39:00]  They got the 20 best mug shots of the year.  Yeah.  And a bunch of the dudes are wearing Obama shirts.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, that's fantastic.  Maybe I shouldn't say a bunch, but I believe there was at least more than one.  A few?  Yeah, there were a few, right?  Were there some Obama shirts there?  There were 15 people just wearing Obama.  15?  Oh, there were 15 that had Obama.  Scroll down.  Yeah, scroll down.  So these were the 20.  This is worth looking at when you go to work.  We'll link it at onaradio.com. 
[01:39:30]  But, oh, okay, they're all Obama shirts.  They're all wearing Obama shirts.  Oh, well.  Yeah, one guy has the change shirt on.  There you go.  Another guy has the yes, we can stop the drama another guy has.  So Obama, OA, yeah, we'll link that, onaradio.com.  Classic.  Damn, they like Obama.  Yeah, they like Obama.  And then Eddie Murphy.  Yeah, she's my favorite, the girl in the cow suit.  Sure. 
[01:40:00]  The black woman in the cow outfit with the udders.  Yeah.  Someone's saying old drag racing is fun to watch.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, damn.  Like funny car or like really old school?  The old school top fuel dragsters where they had the engine in front of the driver.  That was insane to watch.  With the parachutes?  When the engine would blow and the guy would get a face full of hot oil and fire.  Yeah, because it's so backwards.  Before they decided to put the motor behind him.  They decided, you know, maybe we ought to put the engine behind the driver. 
[01:40:30]  How did humans last as long as we did?  Our ancestors were dumb.  Just hysterical.  Who was the guy that came up with, yeah, you're going to go how many miles?  Like they go over a quarter of a mile, right?  They were coming close to 200.  All right.  The old slingshots, now they're up to like 300.  All right.  But some dummy says, look, we're going to go over 200 miles an hour.  We're going to have the engine in front.  In front of you.  And no one raised their hand and said, this is not a good idea.  We should have the engine in back.  The biggest thing they did at that point was try to put straps on the engine to keep like the heads from flying off. 
[01:41:00]  But then the straps themselves became more shrapnel to just fly into the guy's face.  You've got a big giant rubber band in the face, too, with your hot oil.  Amazing.  Let's try to put the engine in the back.  I mean, you look back.  When it blows up.  You look back at this old footage and you're like, why couldn't you figure it out?  That it's not fun to go to the beach in a one-piece suit. 
[01:41:30]  And a dress for the women.  And wear it with an umbrella.  All right.  An umbrella, a dress for the women.  They had to wear the big floppy hat.  That didn't seem comfortable at the beach in the middle of July.  Don't forget, though, back then, like medical, like when you had a baby, you were finished.  Like, I don't think there were as many C-sections.  Like, they basically wanted to buzz off.  I think that they probably all looked really bad.  A lot of ladies covering up for that.  Well, in the old, the first Miss America pageant, the bathing suit portion of the contest, they 
[01:42:00]  were wearing those stupid little bathing suits.  Yeah.  And those were, you know, young girls.  Sure.  Young girls, beautiful girls.  Not too beautiful.  I mean, look at the guys even wearing the striped wife beater.  Get this on on a radio.  And the little tiny shorts at the beach.  Right.  Parish the thought, we show on nipples.  They just didn't want to show themselves.  No.  It's hysterical.  What is that?  What is he wearing? 
[01:42:30]  What, did he just break out of prison?  Why did they all have stripes?  I don't know.  Why were they all striped?  So they could be identified?  Ah, he's the typical looking muskull man.  I like him because he looks like Travis.  He does look a little like Travis.  A little Travis to him.  Travis is a great granddad.  Yeah.  At Jones Beach.  It's mad dog Travis.  Hey, looking at other stuff on the BlackBerry, some of the news. 
[01:43:00]  You hear about Eddie Murphy?  Picked up a tranny?  What?  They got the Batman franchise on track.  Oh, no.  Eddie Murphy is going to play the Riddler.  All right.  That's done.  That franchise is done.  Eddie Murphy as the Riddler.  That's going to take you so out of the movie.  And Eddie Murphy as two Riddlers.  Is that real or is that some...  They're talking about it.  They're talking about it.  Oh, so it might be one of those dumb Hollywood stories. 
[01:43:30]  Wow, that didn't take long.  To get to make.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, instead of the Riddler, it was Steve from Bayshore came up with an alternative name.  Oh, okay.  It starts with N.  But it still ends with, you know, the end of the Riddler name.  I don't get it yet.  Thank you.  I'll explain a little more.  No, why don't you explain now?  Why don't you explain now?  Explain now.  I don't know if that'll be good or not, to be honest with you.  Let's explain now. 
[01:44:00]  If it's dark, like, if it's dark, like, oh, Jesus.  Good point.  If it's dark the way, I mean, we'll never be like what Heath Ledger did because he's nowhere  near the actor Ledger was, but if it's a darker portrayal of the Riddler, because I got so  bored with Eddie Murphy so many years ago, like, I wanted to see him play the dark character  once.  You know something?  I'll agree with you on that.  To get him away, to reinvent himself, to get him away from the he's playing a guy in a 
[01:44:30]  fat suit or he's playing every character in the movie, horrid comedies that he's trying  to pull off these days.  If he does reinvent himself as some kind of evil, really, kind of thing.  He doesn't have it in him.  I don't think he doesn't either.  And it should be noted that this is just an internet rumor right now, thank God.  Oh, is it?  But with that said, what was the last Eddie Murphy movie that you went, wow, cool?  Dude.  I can't even think of one.  Coming to America, I think.  I think it was a great comedy.  Maybe Coming to America. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  How many years ago was that?  Because then he started dipping into the sequel well.  What was the last good Eddie Murphy movie?  48 Hours 2.  Here's his IMDb.  The Incredible Shrinking Man of, you know, and you can't count the Shrek stuff.  No.  Meet Dave, no.  Norbit, no.  Dream Girls, no.  Haunted Mansion, remember that disaster?  Daddy Daycare.  I'm leaving the 2000s already. 
[01:45:30]  The Adventures of Pluto, no.  Dr. Doop, no.  Hold on.  Dr. Doolittle, no.  That was a massive hit for him, though.  Was it?  Yeah.  I'm talking about us.  And we sort of represent the average dude out there.  What was the last Eddie Murphy movie we saw where we went right on?  God, this Eddie Murphy.  I love him.  We're losing the two.  We're leaving the 2000s.  48 Hours.  Without a hit that the average guy like us would have enjoyed.  Nutty Professor, I bet.  Shrek 2001. 
[01:46:00]  Like I said.  Nutty Professor 2, The Clumps.  Ew.  No.  Bowfinger.  Now we're in the 19s, right?  Life.  Holy Man.  Just stop me when one of these makes you go, yes.  Dr. Doolittle for us.  I would say Dr. Doolittle.  Moulin.  Moulin Rouge.  Chappelle was in Dr. Doolittle.  That broke him.  That's the role that really people really put him.  Are we going to stop around Dr. Doolittle?  I know Chappelle was amazing in that movie.  Yeah, he was funny.  He played the comedian ripping Eddie Murphy apart from being fat. 
[01:46:30]  So I would say that was the last one that kind of, as far as I knew, had any kind of hip relevance to it.  Metro, The Nutty Professor.  Now we're down to 96.  Vampire in Brooklyn.  I'm a Hills Cop.  Three?  Oh, no.  That was 94.  The sequels were awful.  The Distinguished Gentleman.  Boomerang.  Wow.  Another 48 hours.  Now we're down to 1990.  I'm talking about, like, us.  Trading places.  Coming to America.  I think Jimmy's got Harlem Nights and then you got Coming to America, 1988. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  Was that the last Eddie Murphy movie where the average guy said, wow?  That's 20 years ago.  Chappelle was in Nutty Professor, not Dr. Doolittle.  Oh, right, right.  You're right.  Did I say Nutty Professor?  I don't know.  No, you said that when I said Dr. Doolittle.  Whatever.  I think I said Nutty Professor.  You've got to give us a little something-something.  That's what I meant.  We messed up.  Nutty Professor.  Oh, we are late now.  Yeah.  All right.  So we go back to what?  Coming to America?  As the last Eddie Murphy movie that the average guy liked?  I would say Nutty Professor.  Nutty Professor, maybe. 
[01:47:30]  For me, Coming to America, though.  I go back to Trading Places.  Yeah.  That's 83.  That's 80 F in three.  That was the second movie that he did.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  That was only his second movie.  I understand.  28 Hours was a good movie.  Beverly Hills Copied before.  Don't forget Best Defense with Dudley Moore.  Yes, Best Defense was fantastic.  How can I argue with that, Jimmy?  Two seconds.  All right.  Quick break.  I think we're going to try to get Dennis Leary on the phone.  He's got a book signing.  Okay.  He's got a couple, right?  A couple he wants to promote really fast. 
[01:48:00]  So hopefully he's on the bestseller list.  Huh?  He's on the bestseller list.  That bastard.  Dennis Leary most likely next.  Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We've got to go right to the phones.  We've got our pal Dennis Leary on the phone.  He's only got a few minutes.  Hey, Dennis.  How are you, sir?  Hey, guys.  What's up, Mike?  I've got to tell you.  I've got to start by saying I brought you on my honeymoon.  Oh, the book?  I read your book on my honeymoon.  Oh, you did?  I was on the honeymoon, by the way.  It was awesome.  We had a really good time.  It was really mellow.  Oh, cool. 
[01:48:30]  I was sort of hanging with Colin Farrell.  I know I'm name-dropping, but...  Wait a minute.  You're not just name-dropping.  You're honeymoon name-dropping.  You're supposed to be involved...  Yeah.  ...with the woman who's going to be involved with you for the rest of your life,  but you're actually trying to find a way to have a drink with Colin.  Oh, absolutely.  I got a what's up mate from him, so I feel like I was doing pretty well.  Do you know who you were?  Hell no.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe.  He was staring at Colin Farrell.  Let me clarify that.  Let's be honest.  Colin Farrell probably doesn't even know who the woman who was with him was. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Hey, guys.  I've got to tell you something.  Yeah.  Obviously, I've been aware of the power of your reach for many, many years,  but I've never done a book before, and I've never been on a book tour.  You guys are like the anti-Oprah.  There are so many people out there who go to bookstores and buy books because you guys tell them to.  Yeah.  Remember when I was on the air with you guys, and I jokingly said something like,  if you come to the book signing and you buy a copy of my book and a copy of Jim Norton's book, 
[01:49:30]  that was one thing.  People, every signing I've been at, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston,  people walk up with the Jim Norton book and my book, and they go,  yeah, there's John O.P. and Anthony, there's John O.N.A.  It's unbelievable.  Thank you.  By the way, congratulations, man.  I mean, I knew you were going to get on the list.  Yeah.  You never knew where in the campaign.  I think, what did you, I saw you hit number nine, I think.  I'm at number seven right now.  Wow.  Look at that. 
[01:50:00]  Wait on, I want to blow past what Dennis Leary just said.  Yeah, by the way, I just want to say, the only reason that I'm on this thing,  I'm convinced, because the only gigantic radio show, I mean, I didn't do Oprah.  I didn't do, this is the only thing I can trace it to in terms of people.  And I'm telling you specifically, like, well, Jim knows, because he's done it.  New Jersey, you know, these people, there's gigantic amounts of people,  that listen to the show, and then show up, they tell you, you know, 
[01:50:30]  hey, I'm on ONA, blah, blah, blah, blah, hey, I heard you on ONA.  So it's, I mean, literally, you guys should be getting credited as the anti-opist,  because I'm convinced that between the power of the radio, it's like,  you know the reason that Artie Lange's book is selling it.  So you know the reason that my book is selling it.  All right.  Now, Dennis, let me jump in.  I hear exactly what you're saying.  So, and I expect our phone call to be on Rescue Me any time now, right?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I think you guys also have to just, like, maybe you've already done it. 
[01:51:00]  Like, you have to embrace this thing like Oprah does.  I think you guys got to start picking, like, you know, she picks her book of the month.  You guys got to pick your book of the month, your book of the week, whatever it is.  And you got to tie in.  I think you got to get percentages.  Do we have to go with, like, you know, current books, or should we go with, like, old school?  What do we do?  I think you guys do whatever you want.  Do we go, like, chick books?  Yeah, well, see, here's the thing.  What if she does, like, chick lit, mostly, and, like, feel-good stuff, Oprah, right?  So maybe you guys should be going in the opposite direction, which, by the way, with my book and Jim, you're already there anyway. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  Can I tell you, too, that you're right.  And they always said that, like, late-night TV doesn't sell books as well for whatever reason.  Maybe because morning radio, people are out and about with their day afterwards.  But they said that radio really pushes books a lot more than television does for whatever reason.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know what the reasoning is.  It's just you can get a direct, you know.  I would argue against that late-night thing, too, because I did Letterman, and I got a lot of Letterman people.  But there's no question that radio people, maybe it's because when you're driving or you're doing your stuff in the morning, you're more lucid. 
[01:52:00]  And you don't have, like, you know, six beers in you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I don't know.  You actually remember the thing that Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton and the guys told you you might want to buy.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I like the book.  It's Why We Suck, A Feel-Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy, and Stupid.  You give America in general a nice beating.  I do.  What I liked about it was that you're a traditional guy.  I like that you're a family guy.  And you take your friends and your family very seriously.  And you had a lot of nice jokes and stories in there about that stuff. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, look, you know, I'm no genius.  You know what I mean?  I'm pretty much limited to what I know, which is sports.  Well, the book says it, you know.  It's sports and all the other stupid crap that's happened to me, which is what I wrote about.  But, you know, my mother's in the book, and it's all common sense about, you know, whether it's sports or the Catholic Church or, you know, bringing up kids.  You know, I keep getting this, too, when I'm at these book signings.  Like, you think you know what your demographic is.  But I'm getting, like, moms who are coming in, you know, to get their books signed. 
[01:53:00]  And, you know, I'm getting grandmothers.  I got this woman in Chicago who was, like, 90 years old, but she looked like she was about 70.  And she was like, I laughed my ass off at your book.  I wish more people in my family would listen to me.  I feel the same way.  So I think it's just very common sense stuff.  I'm sorry, Dennis.  You got signings, too, man, which is I know your signings are probably mobbed.  And you got one tonight here.  It's in Jersey, 730 Barnes & Noble at 395 in Route 3 East in Clifton. 
[01:53:30]  And I know that you've probably been getting a great turnout for your signings.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  I think you do the same thing because the book people seem shocked when you tell them this.  But if you buy the book, you know, I'm going to personalize it for you.  And we're going to take a picture because I keep hearing at these bookstores that some  authors come in and they sit, like, 20 yards away from the crowd.  And they hand the guy the book and he signs it.  But you never get to meet the guy and he doesn't personalize it and there's no pictures.  He doesn't look up.  You know, if you're spending 25 books for what is shaped like a book in my case, because 
[01:54:00]  it's funny.  I'm not a great writer, but I'll tell you, the book is funny.  You're going to come over.  We're going to take a picture.  I'll personalize it.  And I'm getting, it's great, too.  I think maybe, Jim, you probably get that.  My people that get your book are telling me to sign your face on the cover of your book,  which you have my permission to do on my book, too, by the way.  I would be happy if I did any more signings.  I will certainly sign your face.  If people walk up and give me your book, I'll be glad to sign your face and write something  derogatory about both of us.  Now, that's what I get. 
[01:54:30]  I don't care about that.  I get people requesting, like, literally, people walk up and they go, yeah, sign that  one, go to hell, you a-hole.  That's for my dad.  And then this one is Merry Christmas, die.  That's for my mom.  It's all like that.  It's hilarious, you know?  Well, we need to do something different, because last time it was, you know, bring  Jimmy's book.  I want to see how many fans go to these latest book signs.  What can we come up with now?  Bring Jimmy's book.  No, well, bring Jimmy's book, of course, but maybe a little twist.  What can we do?  What can we do?  Something that makes Dennis very uncomfortable. 
[01:55:00]  We're not about to prove the power of the O&A Book Club, which has just been created,  at least in theory.  We could just have fans ask if you're gay over and over again.  We could do that.  We could have fans ask if Jimmy's gay.  How about this?  You buy Dennis' book.  Yeah.  If you have a copy of mine, you present it to Dennis to sign, but on the cover of mine,  you've drawn some sort of male genitals on my face.  All right.  This is the one.  Which, by the way, proves we're both gay. 
[01:55:30]  You're right.  We killed two birds with one stone.  If you come to the book sign in New Jersey tonight, and you buy Jim Norton's book and my  book, I'll sign my book, and I'll draw a piece of male genitalia on Jim's book cover.  And also, Dennis, you got a couple on Saturday, too.  I know we're on Connecticut.  The first one is at 4.30 p.m.  It's not a Saturday, though, so it's easy.  It's called the Hickory Stick Bookshop.  It's on Green Hill Road in Washington Depot, Connecticut. 
[01:56:00]  And then from there, you go 7.30 that night, R.J.  Julia at 768 Boston Post Road in Madison.  So 4.30 is in Washington Depot, Connecticut.  And then 7.30 is in Madison, Connecticut.  That's for Saturday, right?  For Saturday afternoon, yeah, which are pretty easy ones.  Dennis, I wish you called about a half hour ago.  We were talking about old-school hockey, and I know you're a huge hockey fan.  I was watching on MSG Classic, the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, Game 4, Rangers, and I'm not a  Ranger fan, Rangers Flyers. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, man, that is old-school.  David Schultz.  Yeah, the hammer.  Just beating the crap out of people.  The hammer.  And I was telling these guys, man, I miss the old school hockey.  You know what's going to happen now, though, guys?  Mark my words.  I mean, this is real basic sports thinking, because, you know, now they've got an economic  fallout on their hands.  And earlier this week, they announced that the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NBA were  all laying people off from the corporate offices.  Yeah.  But they weren't laying people off from the NHL offices. 
[01:57:00]  And the NHL has always been a live sport.  Like, for instance, last year, the beginning of the baseball season, Tampa Bay, Lightning,  they're in last place, but their building is sold out for the last game of the season.  18,000 people, same day, opening day, across town at the baseball stadium, 6,000 people.  So the NHL has always been a live sport.  So what's going to happen now is, because for the next, like, four or five years, people  are going to be very careful about how they spend their money, the fighting is going to,  this whole idea that the fighting is going away, that's going to just drop right out 
[01:57:30]  of the equation.  Oh, God.  Because, you know, first of all, I love the fighting.  And second of all, now they're going to be like, we've got to sell our product, man.  We've got to keep these buildings full.  So you're going to see, it's going to go back to the old school, I think.  Which, you know, by the way, I don't like goons, but one of the great things about hockey  is, like, unlike anything else in life, if you're going to be a jerk to my teammate, you're  going to have to answer, and you're going to have to answer right now.  Nice.  In front of 18,000 people.  Yeah.  You know?  You're giving me hope, Dennis. 
[01:58:00]  I wish the Senate was run that way.  You know what I mean?  Like, if a guy said something really ridiculous, like, if Barney Frank mouths off about some  ridiculous thing, somebody else just walks up, and they drop the gloves, and they go.  You know?  Right live on C-SPAN, you know?  Well, how about Larry Craig, and him and Barney drop their pants and go?  Actually, they just take Barney and Larry, and they say, why don't you guys go in the  men's room?  Okay, we're going to continue out here.  We'll have a men's room match.  One of the things I'm really excited about, about my book, is I'm number seven this week  or last week.  You know what eight, nine, and ten was? 
[01:58:30]  What?  Barack Obama, Barack Obama, Barack Obama.  Look at you.  I don't know what.  Look at you knocking him out.  Somewhere, the president-elect is looking at that list and going, who the hell is this  guy?  Right.  Right.  So, I'm either about to get audited or invited to the White House.  He's having an appointment.  Because you know he's smoking now.  Yeah, that's amazing.  It's amazing.  Number seven.  And you've been on for a few weeks now.  Look, you know, speaking of Obama, the front page of the paper here in New York, secret  Obama photos.  Have you seen this yet?  Yeah, I do.  He looks like Richard Pryor. 
[01:59:00]  He's got the Richard Pryor look.  Which album from the 70s do you want to mention?  Circa 1980 look, you know?  Right.  It's awesome.  It's some good pics.  Imagine if somebody woke up from a time machine, literally.  If they saw those pictures, they'd go, oh my God, Richard Pryor is the president of the  United States.  Wow.  Things have changed.  I really do love the fact that we have a guy that has admitted that he hasn't really 
[01:59:30]  quit smoking.  And based on this economy and probably the secret terror, you know, papers that he's  saying, you know he's going to end up having the, you know, lighters all over that Oval  Office.  He's going to be smoking Newports.  You know, it's going to be insane.  You know what I mean?  Just to keep himself calm.  It's going to be a nightmare for him to try to figure this crap out.  Oh yeah, this is going to be a long haul.  This is a bad one.  This is a bad one.  This ain't a good one.  We're going to need a lot of pretty talk to get around this one, you know?  Absolutely.  But you know, one of the ways to get around a really bad, listen to this plug. 
[02:00:00]  I hear the book signing plug coming, Dennis.  Yeah, I mean.  I hear it coming a mile away.  To get around, you know, an economic fallout is to laugh your ass off.  And one of the ways I know to laugh your ass off is to go out and buy Jim Norton's new  book or the new Dennis Lurie book, which I hear are both extremely funny.  I think they are.  And I think that you buy them together.  I mean, you're out.  It's like you're using it.  First of all, you're using a credit card.  It's not like you go.  No one goes to a bookstore with cash.  No.  1962.  You go with a credit card. 
[02:00:30]  You buy them both.  They both make great gifts.  And you have to.  And you know what?  In this case, you've bought two books that are going to make you laugh.  And when you're done, you know, making, laughing at the books, they both make great coasters.  You know?  And like I said, I'll draw, you know, a penis on Jim's face.  And this will keep you bringing it to my signing.  So now you have a famous guy.  You can draw your own penis on my face.  How about that?  You're going to have to call next week to tell us how the penis thing worked out.  I think we've started something here.  I really do.  All right.  Tonight, 730, Barnes & Noble at 395 Route 3, East Clifton, New Jersey. 
[02:01:00]  By the way, guys, you know what I heard on this book tour that the number one most stolen book in every bookstore in the United States is?  The Bible.  Wow.  That is the number one book stolen by people in the United States.  They go to a bookstore.  And it's not poor people who can't afford to buy the Bible who want to read up on some scripture.  It's really well-off people.  And when they get caught, they act like they weren't going to steal it.  How about that?  Why do they do that, you think?  Is it they're embarrassed because they really want to delve into it? 
[02:01:30]  I think some people do that.  And I think the other people are like, I'm not paying for God.  You know?  God's my friend.  You know?  Oh, wow.  By the way, Terrell Owens has been caught stealing 57 of them.  Anyways, guys, thanks.  All right, Dennis.  One more question.  Is there a website that has your signings on it?  Yeah, I think my website does, DennisLerry.com.  Okay.  And are you guys on the air next week?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  All right, you know what I'll do?  I'll call in and tell you how many people came down at these three signings and said,  will you draw a penis on Jim Norton's face? 
[02:02:00]  Nice.  Yes.  If you go to Dennis's signing and you happen to have my book with you, he will draw genitals  on your face.  So, dude, good luck tonight and this Saturday once again.  Jim, you have my permission for your next book signing to do the same thing with my book.  Yeah, I will be very happy to.  And for the people that can't afford both books, you can present your genitalia any way you like.  Because Dennis would secretly enjoy that.  Dennis Lurie, everyone.  Thanks, Dennis.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Quick break, and we'll do a little mopping up for everybody. 
[02:02:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Head of Rolling Stone.  Same, same, same.  Keith Richards. 
[02:03:00]  65 today.  65.  Still, uh...  Still kicking.  Yeah, I was going to say rocking, but...  Yeah.  Still breathing.  Katie Holmes, 30.  Brad Pitt, 45.  Steven Spielberg, the big 6-2.  Not that we do birth days, but...  But we just did.  Yeah.  So, Jack Cafferty, we're doing a little mopping up on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:03:30]  Jack Cafferty, uh...  He used to be a local guy.  He's a grumpy old F.  Yeah.  Now he's on, I think, CNN.  Yeah.  Does the Cafferty file.  Now, we love to play this, but the CD player is now jammed.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  But, uh, this investor that took, what, $50 billion?  Bernie Madoff?  Yeah.  The biggest scam going in maybe history.  Maybe in history.  And a lot of people lost everything because of this guy. 
[02:04:00]  Charities.  Scamming.  Yeah.  And Jack Cafferty had a little something-something to say about it, which is very similar to what  Jimmy was saying.  Where'd the money go?  I don't know.  Like, trying to figure out where this money went.  I would like to think that it made other people rich, at least.  But is it money that just is gone in thin air?  Like, how does that work?  I guess some other people got it.  But our...  It's like a Ponzi scheme, right?  Yeah.  People did get paid, and now those people will have their profits come after because they're...  Oh, good. 
[02:04:30]  It's considered ill-gotten gains, and the lawsuits are already lining up.  Yeah, but they didn't know.  I know, but it's still ill-gotten gains.  And there's no time limit.  Like, those people who are innocent like investors who got out...  And actually made money.  And made money.  The disgusting government will go after their money.  Yeah.  Instead of just going after the ones...  Nobody was really in on it, right?  So they'll go after these citizens and then still bail out banks and all this other...  It just makes you sick to your stomach.  I mean, this guy was... 
[02:05:00]  Actually, he was a pretty credible guy.  Yep.  And if you invested with him and made some money, the government can come after you for that money.  And you probably paid tax on your profits.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, this wasn't a boiler room thing.  This was like on the up and up.  It was a couple of people.  He had two sets of books and one overseer.  Hey, Stephen S. from Bayshore calls Jack Cafferty the news curmudgeon.  Yes.  That's perfect.  He's quite a curmudgeon. 
[02:05:30]  He's a curmudgeon.  This is what he had to say about the whole thing.  Just a quick question before I get to my question.  You know, if the New York City Police Department arrests a drug dealer, you know, with some crack cocaine in his pocket,  they take him out to Rikers Island and throw him in a cell with a couple of hundred people and let him rot there until it's time for his trial.  This clown, who's accused of stealing $50 billion from people, is placed under house arrest in his $7 million Park Avenue apartment in New York City.  Okay. 
[02:06:00]  Can you explain that to me?  I can't.  But he's out on $10 million bail, which apparently he could post.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  All right.  Wolf Blitzer will never explain that because he plays it safe every single moment he's on CNN.  Well, after that one slip up during Katrina.  True.  So I guess he's...  I guess you're right.  He's thinking about every word that comes out of his mouth.  Yeah, we can't explain that stuff, and it'll just continue.  I'm just hoping for the day, and I'm hoping I'm alive for it.  The famous, we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, something happens.  Apparently, this guy had something going where he'd bring in more investors, get their money, pay off the people that had come on earlier, start giving them money.  He kept two sets of books, the real one and the fake one, and he'd pay off the people that came in.  But then after a while, when the investors dried up, the new ones, he wasn't able to pay out anymore, and that's when this whole thing folded. 
[02:07:00]  That's pretty much what a Ponzi or a pyramid scheme is.  Because people start demanding their money back, like the hedge funds and stuff, right, because the economy's collapsing.  But in 1999, a mathematician saw this and said, this ain't right.  He wrote a letter to the SEC saying, this stinks, there's a problem here, it can't be happening.  And they did nothing.  Probably because it would be a big one to deal with.  Just look the other way.  That's what we're doing in this country.  We're learning out that a lot of people that you think are looking out for us are just looking the other way. 
[02:07:30]  Not under my watch is the famous.  No effing way do I take this on.  Yeah, I don't want this happening during my administration.  Why is he not on Rikers Island?  I mean, it really sickens me.  It probably does.  They're probably broke because of him.  You know, house arrest would suck if it was like my old apartment.  A mice infested, black mold, cockroach infested apartment.  But penthouse, worth millions on the Upper East Side.  In paradise. 
[02:08:00]  Right.  What is that?  No physical threat.  No threat of some young thug breaking his jaw.  And that's what should be happening to this guy.  And you wonder why I complain about the death penalty because rich people can do whatever they want.  It makes me sick to say that.  Man!  I know, dude.  Believe me.  I know.  I know.  I sound like that.  I'm sorry.  But it's the truth.  Look at this bum.  This guy ruined people's lives, man.  Ugh.  We'll see what happens, you know.  Obviously, he's going to have to. 
[02:08:30]  This man is going to have to have his comeuppance.  Yeah.  Whether it's in one of these, as they call them, country clubs or resort prisons.  That's exactly.  White collar prisons.  What will happen?  I see this guy's assets being just frozen, taken.  Mm-hmm.  You know what?  You make a rich guy broke.  That's a bitch, man.  That is a bitch.  You watch Trading Places.  These guys, they're never officially broke.  He'll have money somewhere they can't touch. 
[02:09:00]  Sure, he's not, you know, close to a billionaire, but he'll still be well into the millions there.  Hmm.  That's not enough.  These guys never end up, you know, totally broke like Trading Places.  And even if they do, that's not enough.  Mm-hmm.  That's not enough just to make him one of us, or not one of us, I'm not broke, but middle class or lower.  That's not enough.  The bottom line is he ruined charities, man.  Yeah.  This guy is a scumbag.  He should have the fear. 
[02:09:30]  Every day, he should have the fear that he might be assaulted in many different ways in prison.  No protection.  No protective custody.  No.  I will take, I have more respect for a bank robber.  I got more respect for a guy that slings drugs and makes $60,000 a week because he comes from a, I'm not making excuses for drug dealers, but when you grow up in the South Bronx and, you know, literally, what do you have, $150 a week you make or $200 a week?  They have nothing.  And then you see a guy making $60,000 a week.  I understand why a guy becomes a dope dealer. 
[02:10:00]  This guy is just a predatory scumbag.  Wow, you really have changed.  But I really haven't, though.  I really haven't that much.  Guys like this, I've always wanted to see guys like this just really take it.  I mean, we were on food stamps.  I was with you when you said that these guys need to be dragged into the street, you know.  Yeah.  You know, something ridiculous has to happen to these guys to stop this.  Coliseum.  Just build a Coliseum.  Go Coliseum.  Let's go old school.  Let's go Romans.  Gladiator.  He'd be that guy that was crying and then wet himself before the gate opened up. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I love that scene.  And he got a mace right to the face.  I love that scene.  And then his partner had to chop his hand off.  Yeah.  That guy's hysterical.  He's standing there and Maximus is just looking at him and he's standing in his own wet.  And he's crying.  And you just know, I don't think this guy's going to make it very far.  I'm going to.  I got to watch that movie again.  He's just like, oh, no.  That big German guy has got to be saddled with him. 
[02:11:00]  Pat from Minaki, I was involved in a Fonzie scheme.  Hey.  Oh, God.  Well, you know.  Oh, Brad.  A Fonzie scheme.  He goes, hey, I'm broke.  Oh, buddy.  Yeah.  Cunningham, I'm out of money.  A Fonzie scheme.  We got to get out of here.  We're going to leave you guys with this.  This station here in New York goes right to music, though.  No more commercials.  So, you know, check out what they're doing after us. 
[02:11:30]  I honestly don't.  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure it out myself.  They're rocking.  I heard.  They're rocking.  I heard some Alice in Chains.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are they doing my doors that we were talking about earlier?  I hope not.  Here's Kenny singing.  The hit of the day.  See you tomorrow.  And now, singing sensation, Club Soda Kenny.  Superstar, where are you from?  How's it going?  I know you got a clue what you're doing. 
[02:12:00]  You can play Renew to all the other chicks out there, but I know what you are.  What you are, baby.  Look at you, getting more than just a re-up.  Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up.  Faking like a good one, but I call them like I see them.  I know what you are.  What you are, baby.  Womanizer, woman, woman, womanizer.  You're a womanizer.  Oh, womanizer.  Oh, you're a womanizer.  Baby, you're a womanizer.

Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman 
[02:13:00]  not the swagger of a champion, too bad for you can't find the right champion, I guess  when you got one too many that makes it hard, it could be easy who you are, that's just  who you are baby, lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker, to take what I am, would  be a victim not another, say it play it how you wanna, but no way I'm ever gonna fall  for you, never for you, baby, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, you're a womanizer, I'm a womanizer, 
[02:13:30]  you're a womanizer, baby, you, you, you are, you, you, you are, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer,  womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer,  Why is that so loud? 
[02:14:00]  I don't know.  Is the bed too loud?  Maybe the bed was too loud, so I turned up my headphones.  Yeah, that's what I just did.  Wow.  It sounds a little different in here today, by the way.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Opie and Anthony, Jimmy's doing a phoner.  He'll be back on the show in a couple minutes here.  Anthony's opening up more Christmas gifts.  Yeah, this is from Deco Bill.  And what did he send you?  Anything good?  Yeah, of course.  He sent me some stuff from an era that I enjoy. 
[02:14:30]  The Sanity's?  No, no, no.  This is anywhere from, you know, 1932 to 1945-ish.  Ish.  You know, that's...  I could say the ish.  That's kind of where I like that part of history.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a bunch of...  There seems to be some Nazi comic books  and a couple of telegrams or letters from banks  that are stamped with the old Reich's seal. 
[02:15:00]  And it says Heil Hitler on the bottom.  What about the comic books?  That's a little weird.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like comic books, Nazi comic books.  Are they funny comic books?  I don't know how funny you can make a Nazi comic book.  But then there's this.  Or they attempted to be funny in their own right.  On their own right.  Right.  Look at this thing.  Wow.  This is old, I guess.  That's an old record.  An old record.  What speed is this?  33 and a third RPM.  Yeah.  And it is Hitler's Inferno in words, in music. 
[02:15:30]  1932 to 1945.  Marching songs of Nazi Germany.  So finally I have some Christmas music to play around the house.  Wait till the neighbors get a load of marching songs of Nazi Germany.  What's some of the tracks on that thing?  Well, let's see.  First we get Adolf Hitler Speaks in Rome, 1937.  Yeah.  Then we get the crowd cheers and sings Deutschland über Alice. 
[02:16:00]  What is that?  A-L-L-I-N-E-D-A-S-B-E.  Steve from Bayshore to help me out with this one.  All right.  Die Fein...  Die Fein...  Ha-ch.  That's a bunch of Nazi stormtroopers singing that one.  The Nazi stormtroopers also sing Heil Hitler.  And Paul Joseph Goebbels introduces Adolf Hitler in 1934. 
[02:16:30]  We get Hitler speaking in Vienna.  More Nazi stormtroopers.  Who knew they could sing?  Heil Deutschland.  Were they the boy band of the day?  They must have been.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the small Berlin school children sing a little song.  And then we got Goring Hess and von Ribbentrop, et cetera, pleading not guilty at the Nuremberg war crime trial to tie the whole thing up, I guess. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, wonderful.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  I don't have a record player.  I'd like to play it, though.  Why is E-Rock?  What are you doing, E-Rock?  Yeah, put that on DVD for me.  Do we have a record player here?  Put that on a CD for me.  Yeah.  We have one somewhere, so we can go over and search this.  I'm going to put that on my iPod.  How great is that, that you've got to now, like, search out a record player?  Yeah.  You hear them?  Yeah, there might be one around here somewhere.  It's not at this facility, so...  Not even at this facility.  Yeah, go... 
[02:17:30]  Be very careful with that.  Yeah.  But I would like to have it on CD, so I could transfer it onto my iPod and, you know, maybe  give it a listen.  People know the translation.  The translation of what?  I don't know.  Let's ask Dana in Minnesota.  Dana!  Dana!  Good morning, boys.  Hello, Dana.  The translation of that song, that Deutschland über alles, literally, is Germany over all.  So it's probably something like Germany superior, or Germany beloved. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, of course.  I'm sure it's...  Yeah, wonderful.  I'm sure it's very marchy sounding, and...  Yeah.  Punch it out, David.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Pat in Belmore.  Pat.  Hey!  I just wanted to tell everybody out there not to worry about Anthony, because he's really  more of a friendly, cute Nazi, like Sergeant Schultz or Colonel Glenn.  Yeah.  You're Sergeant Schultz.  I just enjoy the era.  See, people don't understand that era.  Yeah.  Uh, I'm fascinated with the entire time period, and not just with Germany, with the entire 
[02:18:30]  world, what was going on back then.  That's all.  I want to...  That's all I'm trying to say.  I want to put you in a little bit of a quandary.  Uh, it goes with what we're saying here.  Uh-huh.  Now, you got that family that named their daughter or son...  Their son.  Son, Adolf Hitler Campbell.  Adolf Hitler Campbell.  Now, I know that every once in a while you like to be charitable.  You read about something in the paper, next thing you know, some crippled girl's getting  her wheelchair back or something, right? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, I try.  Every once in a while.  Let's say Adolf Hitler Campbell becomes parentless and needs a new home.  Aw.  Are you willing to bring it in Adolf Hitler Campbell to your abode?  Uh, Opie, you know how I feel about children?  That's the quandary, my friend.  Uh.  That's the quandary part of the quandary.  I would have to...  I would have to, um...  What would Anthony Cumiya do?  Actually, what I would probably do...  Probably your last name sounding more Nazi every day for...  I don't know why, but... 
[02:19:30]  Yeah?  I've been saying your last name for many years, but now when I say it...  That's a very Italian name.  I understand, but Cumiya.  It's just starting to sound more and more German, I should say.  Ah.  Oh.  Thank you.  Understanding that it is an Italian last name.  Uh, Opie, I don't believe Adolf Hitler Campbell, um, should, uh, have to endure the pain of  losing his parents, so I would probably just take a cyanide capsule, put it, uh, between  his little molars, and smack his jaw shut, uh, thus ending any problems, uh, with poor 
[02:20:00]  little Adolf Hitler Campbell.  Adolf Hitler Campbell.  Because that's how, you know, his namesake would have taken care of the problem.  Right.  You know, when, uh, uh, Adolf Hitler saw that his country...  Yeah.  Uh, which, you know, amounted to, uh, what, what, what Adolf Hitler Campbell's parents  would be, you know, uh, he saw that going down the, uh, crapper, uh, knew he was losing  it, uh, he decided to, um, you know, that life wasn't worth living. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  So I'm sure a little Adolf Hitler Campbell would bite down on that cyanide capsule with, with  yeah, gusto.  Yeah, I've been following that story, and I don't think the parents are as brave as  everyone thinks.  No?  Why doesn't the father change his name to, to Adolf Hitler?  He's gotta work.  No, Adolf Hitler Campbell, get rid of the Campbell, go with the Hitler.  He likes his family name.  He also likes Adolf Hitler.  Not so brave.  It's cute to, you know, name the newborn.  Why don't you name yourself Adolf Hitler? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  And drop that old pesky Campbell thing to make it perfectly clear what you're going for.  You know no one will use that kid's middle name, like in school and everything.  It's going to be Adolf.  Right.  Adolf Campbell.  They won't even do the Adolf.  Adolf they could do.  That's, that's still pretty much a name, but, um, they'll do Adolf Campbell.  They'll call him Aiden or something.  Dolph.  Yeah.  Dolph Lundgren.  Sure, something.  Hey, I hear we got fans out there with Christmas gifts, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Well, now, uh, I just got a Lulu.  How are you going to beat the stuff Anthony just got? 
[02:21:30]  Echo Bill just sent me a Lulu.  Yeah.  Um, with my Nazi, uh, stuff.  I remember you guys.  You're the podcasters.  Yes.  All right.  These are, these guys are the podcasters.  Indeed.  Yes.  Uh, did we say nice things about you guys last time you were here?  Yes, you did.  Yeah.  Very nice.  What did we say?  Just so we, we were just really nice.  Uh, you let me do stand up and you said I did a good job.  Oh, yeah, you did.  Okay.  I, I, I knew I knew you from somewhere.  Yup.  Sure.  Stand up to the crowd.  One day. 
[02:22:00]  And, and your podcast, uh, is what?  It's hate speech radio.  That's right.  Hate speech radio.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Mm-hmm.  And we're here with gifts from Expressions, adult stores.  Oh, were you listening to yesterday's show?  I did hear some yesterday's show.  I hated the cock ring thing.  I hated the vibrating cock ring.  I have no cock rings.  All right, good.  We, we don't have cock rings.  All right.  Very good.  Damn, no cock rings.  You felt like you had to talk there.  I, I know how it goes.  I did.  Yeah, I, I understand.  Sam knows.  We're on my course.  Sam knows.  When Dave is taking the spotlight too much, Sam jumps in. 
[02:22:30]  Just so people don't forget about him.  Yeah.  I do.  How was the man on man, the kiss thing at home?  Oh, that was, it was like, you know, it was just a goof.  It was totally not, you know, you're my world.  I just think of you, Bob.  It was, it was, it was a long conversation.  Oh, yeah.  You guys want to take this stuff out?  Sure.  Um, no, hand it out.  Yeah.  One at a time.  You could just take it out.  What is that?  That's a little Christmas ornament.  Well, Jimmy's being a star somewhere else right now.  I'll take a bag with it.  Oh, nice.  Oh, so it's a little stripper type of Christmas ornament that goes on. 
[02:23:00]  I also want to know why Big A's elbows were just bleeding profusely on Saturday.  Because Danny just casually mentioned that during the break.  Big A spontaneously starts bleeding from his arms or something.  I think I'm a little distracted because I need to know what happened to Big A before  we open the Christmas gifts.  And maybe by that time, Jimmy will be back from his phone.  Yes, Big A.  Well, I'll set it up a little better.  Big A wanted to come down for Bob Kelly's Saturday Night Virus show.  So he was sitting on the bleachers and everything's fine. 
[02:23:30]  And all of a sudden, I heard a voice just go, hey, man, you're bleeding.  And it was one of Bobby's guests.  And I look over and I see a huge just stream of blood coming down Big A's arm.  And everybody's like, hey, what happened?  Did you cut yourself?  He's like, I don't know.  So he had no idea where this blood was coming from, and it just wouldn't stop.  And like an hour later, it must have been still bleeding because he asked me for a Band-Aid.  Wow.  Big A, what happened?  Honestly, I don't know. 
[02:24:00]  Did you scrape your elbows?  That's the obvious one.  Was it an old scab?  No.  That's not that I know of.  Let's see your elbows.  Where was it bleeding from?  Oh, boy.  Get Dr. C.  There, Paul.  You don't know what happened?  There's nothing there?  It was elbow stigmata.  Yeah, stigmata.  It had to be a decent enough cut, too, because, I mean, everybody's scraped themselves.  But in order to get like a nice flowing stream of blood, like you have to be cut pretty decently. 
[02:24:30]  He's showing us an arm that has no hint of a cut.  There's nothing.  It is.  And this was Saturday night, meaning a few days ago?  Right.  Actually, it would be more like...  Oh, what's up?  It would be more like st-st-st-st-st-st-st-st.  Ig-mada.  You just kind of woke up, Andrew, when she was screaming?  Yeah, covered in blood.  Is there anything there, Danny?  Danny's checking out the wound site. 
[02:25:00]  There should be one, but there isn't.  I don't see anything.  For the amount of blood he lost...  We need weird medicine, dude.  We need Dr. Steve.  He'll explain this one.  For the amount of blood he lost, you should...  I mean, it wasn't like, you know...  It was enough that you noticed.  Yeah, it wasn't like the shining elevator, but I mean, it was a nice stream of blood.  It looked like, you know, when someone gets like a decent enough nosebleed where there's  a nice big stream.  I mean, it was nice.  It was pretty decent.  You want any medications?  No, I'm not. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, that's smart.  You should be on 20 or 30.  It's off the top of my head.  You should have a pill box where...  Because you have to take so much medication.  You've got to keep it all organized.  Those vertical stripes really work for you.  Oh, yeah.  I've got to tell you that.  It's slimming.  Yeah.  Slimming for what?  No, it actually makes it...  It's hysterical the way it, like, what did Pat from Manaki call it?  It looks like a graphic version of gravity around... 
[02:26:00]  He looks like a visual representation of space-time.  Of space-time.  Yeah, when he wears a striped shirt, because you can really see that part where you can tell  gravity's affecting space and time.  Big A, uh...  It's probably Sam's not orbiting him.  Yeah.  Big A, Spiky J wants you to say,  I stabbed my stubborn stump of an elbow with a stick. 
[02:26:30]  Um...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Oh, boy.  Ice...  Ice tea.  Ice...  Come on.  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  Ice...  He wanted to stump it there as well, but good enough. 
[02:27:00]  It's all right.  Actually, I'm kind of impressed by your memory skills.  So, you don't know why you have a cut like that?  That's got to mean something.

[02:31:00]  some fine radio today  no sir  but you might want  to give more too  thank god  thank god you're there  to protect everybody  die  keep ruining radio  holiday music  when I started in radio  yeah we didn't have human resources  oh speaking of when you started in radio  yeah  oh no I just  you talked to somebody that I know  no  you did not talk to the bear man  I did not just talk to him  five minutes ago  oh  thank god you didn't  wow  and not realize it was him

[02:32:00]  I am so happy  I can't wait  well Jimmy's blowing that up  shall we do  well we got Dr. Steven  he might be in the middle  of smelling cum  or whatever the fuck  whatever he does  what does he do  what was that thing  he smelled  urine  oh I thought that was  big A breathing  it's just Jimmy  blowing up the  yeah  yeah sometimes  it's a blow up doll  Dr. Steve  yes sir  how are you sir  good how are you my friend  well we got a weird one today  you know our buddy Big A  who we're all very concerned about 
[02:32:30]  I want to be on record  saying that  absolutely  I think we need to  like fly Big A down  to Tennessee  so he can do an official  examination of him  yeah I've offered to do that  actually  I'd be happy to do that  well Big A  we found out today  Danny said that  his elbow out of nowhere  started bleeding  I was going to say profusely  but good enough  like a good nose bleed  it was to the point  where he had a stream of blood  that was pretty much  all the way  from I'll say  elbow to wrist 
[02:33:00]  yeah  now hold on  we've got to give you  more info  so we bring Big A in  we're like what's that about  he goes I don't know  he said maybe I ate  food that had too much salt  then we examined his arm  where Danny saw  the blood coming from  and there's not a hint  that there was ever  a cut on his arm  really  yeah  is there a callus  or anything  on the elbow  anything callus sir  no  no  skin or callus 
[02:33:30]  oh Big A's there  yeah  oh yeah he's here  right  so yeah  is there any thickening  or anything  I mean elbow skin  a lot of times  if you lean on it  or if you're  slightly overweight  like Big A is  then you can  boy are you kind  it'll crack  Steve I'm going to call it  like elbow region  I don't know if it was  exactly on his elbow  but it was  it was like  mid arm region  yeah  are you  are you having a lot  of bruising  Andrew  no I  I'm not bruising at all 
[02:34:00]  yeah  I don't know  you know  this is something  I'd have to look at  yeah but why no marks  from where the blood  was coming from  this was Saturday  so I mean  he should still have something  I don't know  it's magic  oh thanks  Dr. Steve  which Dr. Steve  yeah  it  you know  it would be something  I'd have to see  to see  if it was indeed  coming from  I mean do we know  where the blood  was actually emanating  from on the  on the elbow 
[02:34:30]  well we're not even sure  it was the official elbow  I think it was a little  I think it was a little  to the side of the elbow  towards like more  of like the  towards like the  outside of the arm  but not on the elbow  joint exactly  right  yeah  oh dude  I mean you're asking me  an unknowable question  at this point  the one thing I would do  is if you know  if he complained to me  that he was having episodes  where he was bleeding  and it wouldn't stop easily  there's things that you can test  just to make sure  that his platelet count  is where it needs to be 
[02:35:00]  and that he's clotting appropriately  and all those things  other than that  it just sounds like  some kind of freak thing  and could have had a paper cut  or you know  who knows  right  okay  but Andrew  I mean if that's the thing  that brings him to the doctor  it's a good thing  because he needs to be  checked out  and he and I  sort of  started that conversation  and I know  Opie you and I  have talked about it  and we just  you know he needs to get  checked out 
[02:35:30]  do you have health insurance  Big A  you can't see a doctor  like immediately up here  I don't have health insurance  I got Blue Cross  that's like shit  no Blue Cross is good insurance  what are you talking about  you have insurance  Andrew  what are you doing  get your ass into a doctor's office  absolutely  yeah he needs a sleep apnea 
[02:36:00]  he needs a lot of things  yeah you got that sleep apnea there Big A  yes yes  I do  yeah  well you're a wreck  well Porky York  from Minnesota  the Porky York  by the way  wow  there's imitators out there  he writes  he probably rubbed up  against some girls  period  not impossible  Andrew are you wearing the mask  um  no 
[02:36:30]  I don't have a mask  I wasn't officially diagnosed  okay  yeah  that's got to be  your first order of business  it really does  and  once  once you get the sleep apnea treated  then a lot of your other medical problems  are going to go away  but without treating that  it can lead to some really long term  serious problems  I mean  it's not just a  a problem  not being able to sleep  it's a problem  of not being able to pump blood  to your lungs  and all kinds of things  Jesus 
[02:37:00]  I really want you to get that  taken care of  yeah  and you'll lose weight quicker  if you get your sleep apnea  if you die  yeah  or that  well this is a joyous  it's perfect for the holiday season  holidays  yes  alright  well Big A  if you have the blue cross  you've got to go see a doctor immediately  yeah  you really got a problem  and then we'll supplement you  with some Dr. Steve knowledge  absolutely  you know  we did get him  what was it officially called 
[02:37:30]  we were trying to get his shit removed  and the lady said  wow I'd never seen anything like this before  it was like cement  he was so impacted  yeah they called it impacted  wow  so what does that mean Dr. Steve  could he  how much shit could Big A have in him  oh he could have pounds and pounds  it just depends on how much fiber he eats  and I'm suspecting that Andrew's probably eating a high carb low fiber diet  would I be right in that  um yes  I don't know 
[02:38:00]  how does it should come out  in very tiny tiny little like logs  because it's squeezing through nuggets  or just massive colon shaped  you know logs  what's better Dr. Steve  to have little tiny uh like spaghetti dumps  or a nice big fat uh  you want a big juicy turd  I mean that's really what you're looking for  I am a healthy boy  I love how Dr. Steve lowers his voice  when he's talking about turds  you're not kidding about a big juicy turd Steve  yeah  why do you leave with the penis 
[02:38:30]  sticking up in the air  Kenny got my thing  my  alright  so I have to look at it  and get proof  alright  yeah  alright Dr. Steve  something Andrew could do right now  is supplement his diet  with some fiber  and I recommend Citrocell  it's a methylcellulose  it's the stuff that they made slime out of  in Ghostbusters 2  and they sell it  and it's not digestible  it doesn't cause gas  and it increases your fiber count  and makes your  your poopies much more pleasurable  and uh 
[02:39:00]  for everyone  yeah for everyone  and it decreases the pressure in the colon  so you get less diverticulosis  and all kinds of stuff  alright  but uh  go get checked out  and I'll email you after the show Andrew  Big A you gotta go get checked out  please  cause I don't know when we can send you to Tennessee  and you know  time's a ticking with you  well I've got some miles  I would actually donate miles  to get him down here  but you know  the problem is follow up  he needs long term follow up  long term  yeah  continuity of care is a big thing 
[02:39:30]  a mess  one visit isn't gonna do it  yeah Big A you don't look good lately  we're a little worried  you gotta go to the doctor  it's probably something fixable  yeah absolutely  absolutely  uh  moving on to more important things  Dr. Steve  your bottle of wine was just terrific  uh  yeah  I opened up the wine yesterday  and uh  you passed  wine.com gave it  thirty eight dollars a bottle  well I got ripped off then  thirty eight dollars a bottle  which means at least  uh  sixty to sixty five 
[02:40:00]  in the liquor store  there you go  which means  close to a hundred dollar bottle  if not more  in a restaurant  there you go  so thank you very much  you're very welcome  wine.com comes through again  for the opster  yeah there you go  very good  good stuff  at this point  I gotta maybe  plead with the audience  no more wine  I told Anthony this morning  I got fifty bottles of wine  in my apartment  I counted yesterday  or just under  like forty eight  and I just got  uh  a wine of the month thing 
[02:40:30]  sent to me yesterday as well  awesome  so that'll be another  two bottles of wine  per month for the next year  well I got a  I don't need any more wine  I got a wine specialist  from Napa Valley  to uh  do a little uh  little commentary  on your thrashing  of me the other day  and that will be  on my show  on December 20th  hey that's a good idea  nice  alright Dr. Steve  always a pleasure  alright thanks  alright man  our buddy Dr. Steve  doesn't really know  what's going on  with Big A  and his mysterious bleeding  from the almost elbow area

[02:47:30]  yeah  you think you're doing  I don't know  I think his girl got to me yesterday  I firmly believe  that it should be Steve  ah  Steve  I'm gonna sit back  and watch this happen  go ahead Jimmy  just sit back  and watch this uh  unfold  yeah  watch him try to make this happen  if he doesn't want to do it  uh huh  here's Steve  um  hold on  what  hi Steve  hi  uh you can ask for that in one hand 
[02:48:00]  and take a steaming dump in the other one  and see which one gets filled first  oh  wow  that's gonna be a hard sell  yeah  yeah it is  so how about  we have a couple of other guys  we have Iraq  we have Danny  we have Sam  I'm gonna put the dick in today  oh you know what  well Sam  Jesus  God that didn't take long  Sam had mentioned it  and uh  I think what would happen  Sam should be forced to  fillet  this blow up doll  um  or Iraq  but I do think that  I want to hear noises too 
[02:48:30]  like  Sam are you in  well  just make believe  it's a corn dog  we all know  Iraq makes the best noises  when he pukes  when he  when his teeth hurt that time  with the cinnamon challenge  you know what  Iraq really hasn't  done a whole lot lately  in way of putting dick in his mouth  he's doing Ant's music thing  okay well how does somebody else  can do Ant's music thing  thinking outside the box  how about  oh shit 
[02:49:00]  it's on the air  it's fine  it's on the air  it's fine  how about after Ant's music thing  is done  where is he doing Ant's music thing  because he's just kind of  cutting the trailer  he's got a place with a turntable  which is across the street  CBS  okay  all right  that makes sense  he had to go there and do it  um okay  how about um  well  looks like he's not available  hmm  so Sam  well no  because we might want to do this  for like a finale thing  for the show 
[02:49:30]  nah I don't think so  it'll be the end  what our year end show  yeah I don't think so  I think it's a good thing to do now  wait for Iraq  and then I'll go do the thing at CBS  how do the bosses feel  what do you guys think  I think uh  we did a lot of gay stuff yesterday  me too  too much  I uh  I say get someone on that knob  of course  of course  hmm  it's plastic  yeah  it's just a piece of fucking plastic  yeah  it's not putting anything else plastic in your mouth  attaboy  would you  would you  would you suck on the tit 
[02:50:00]  I don't know  it's plastic  you suck on the dick  what's the difference  um  what's the difference  I guess I prefer not to do either  why wouldn't you suck on the tit  I wouldn't put the dick in today  oh okay  you would put the dick in  why don't we bring in um  uh Lily  she's not an intern  you know  she's just a fan  oh  yeah yeah  did she show up today  Lily is here  she's just a fan  she's a fan of the show  I hope there's sarcasm behind what you guys are doing 
[02:50:30]  but the bottom line is this  don't acknowledge they're real human beings  those things we're not allowed to do  I understand  but don't even acknowledge that those fuckers are real  Lillian um  doing it  is um  sexy  hi Lily  who's not an intern  because we need to make sure everyone knows that out there in radio land  hi Lily  she signs papers like a  like a like a fan  every fucking day  but you see Lily  there you go  is that good enough fuckers  Lily  sucking the uh 
[02:51:00]  tranny penis  yeah  is sexy  mm-hmm  but Lily could suck on a dildo or vibrator anytime  I would  I figure we'd start somewhere though Jimmy  we gotta like set the bar  you know  the discomfort  which is the only joy in  yes  Lily what would you do with that  I don't know  I don't  so it's a transvestite sex doll  transsexual  transsexual sex doll  transvestite's a guy in a dress  you would know that Jim 
[02:51:30]  yes that's why I said that  because I do know it  I don't know  why don't you go first Jimmy  show me how to do it  yeah that'll happen  yeah it's not gonna happen  yeah  and believe me I'm not afraid to do it  but no  that's  what the kind of thing is  that we're getting someone to do it  that wouldn't want to  yeah  right  that cock  like Jimmy would want to  no that's not  oh I was just trying to explain  what you're saying  no okay  it's like you know  I've done  you know I'm a pervert  it's old hat  we've been down this road 
[02:52:00]  yeah yeah  see the key is  to get one of the guys  on the staff  who doesn't want to do it  to do it  I'm with ya  not the hot chick  cause the hot chick  is kind of cool  we've seen  I've seen porn chicks  fuck  yeah  they can do it much better  than me I'm sure  well it's not about being better  it's about discomfort  Sam  Steve would be so uncomfortable  hey you know who else  isn't an intern  Pat Duffy  Pat Duffy's not an intern  but Pat Duffy  Pat Duffy  you'd have to ask 
[02:52:30]  Pat Duffy ate a live roach  so Pat Duffy  before you finish the sentence  he'd be fucking  lips to torso  on this thing  imagine if HR  got involved  before Pat Duffy  did half the great shit  he did for this radio show  oh I know  but you guys know  what you're doing  hey uh  are we playing  Kiss Lily today as well  I hope so  are there any girls  how many girls  we got out there  well you gotta always  look for the possibilities  anyone willing to  kiss Lily today  that guy raised his hand  oh we got  the one that just  gave us the Christmas  gifts that I already 
[02:53:00]  forgot about  wants to be back  in here to kiss Lily  we can start with that  cause I'm thinking  E-Rock might be in  or Sam  for sucking the cock  yeah  Jimmy I haven't forgotten  oh I know  one of those guys  has to do it  how about Steve  you wouldn't do that  it's not a real one  it's plastic  I'm aware of that  it's not a real one  but no it's not happening  hence the no  it's like  it's like if you're  at a picnic  and you're eating  with plastic utensils  there's no difference  right  it's the same material 
[02:53:30]  just the shape  is different  it's for the show  though Steve  he's not a team player  you can't  Steve comment  why are you  why are you annoyed Steve  I'm not annoyed  I'm perfectly calm actually  okay  wow  if I'm gonna kiss Lily  I need gum  you have bad breath  what do you got  what kind of breath  you got  coffee cigarette breath  coffee cigarette breath  don't give her gum 
[02:54:00]  that makes it even better  who wants fresh breath  Lily you would kiss  cigarette coffee breath  I've done it before  so yeah  alright  and what's the podcast again  hate speech radio  hate speech radio  on cringe humor radio  and she also does stand up  what's your name  Heather Height  Heather Height  will be kissing Lily today  to continue our  kiss Lily bit  very nice  Lily you have no problem  with this  no  what else can we get  done today with this  do we have an agenda

[02:59:30]  greatly  appreciate it  got elephant  man clips  for you  Jimmy  oh I know  that's how  we wanted  to start  this side  of the show  today  sweet Steve  found some  just his  voice  can we  always make  fun of  his voice  yeah  and we got  story of  the day  let's start  with story  of the day  I say  this one  was one  of my  favorites  this could  be story  of the  year  of  this would 
[03:00:00]  be a  contender  for story  of 2008  oh yeah  I think  very late  entry  right under  the wire  you know  with that  said  what are  some of  those other  stories  of the  year  I can't  even remember  maybe the  listeners  could help  us out  because this  one's right  up there  they read  pretty good  Port St.  Lucie  Florida  oh Jimmy's  just reading  the story  Jimmy's reading  it and I  hear a  guffaw  yeah this is  a good one  man  I love a 
[03:00:30]  healthy love  story  do we go  with the  headline or  I don't think  we go with  the headline  no  make it a  bit of a  surprise  police are  seeking  an arrest  warrant  for a man  accused of  hitting his  wife  after she  asked  oh man  I wanted  to tease  this a little  more  but  I don't  need  all right  police are  seeking an  arrest warrant  for a man  accused of  hitting his  wife after  she asked  to smell  his penis  to determine  whether he  was cheating  with another 
[03:01:00]  woman  how great  is that  how great  is that  and just  the circumstance  here  yeah  the 37  year old  victim  told  investigators  her husband  of three  years  punched  her face  and kicked  her arms  and legs  Monday night  after she  accused him  of having  an affair  the victim  said she  told her  25 year old  husband  as he  used the  restroom  to display  his penis  to her  so that  she could  smell it  the report  states  here's where 
[03:01:30]  it just  gets  fantastic  she said  she asked  him to show  his genital  area so she  could determine  whether he  was cheating  with another  woman  as she  went to  sniff her  husband's  penis  he reportedly  punched her  mouth  and started  to kick her  when she was  on the floor  the husband  then fled  the scene  just  just picture  she's down  there  giving it  a good  sniff  and he  can just  like  her head  is right 
[03:02:00]  there for  just a  fucking  right hand  right to  the mouth  bambo  here you  go  smell that  motherfucker  smell my  fist  I think  this is  harder to  explain  than just  refusing to  allow her  to smell  it  you pop her  in the head  obviously he  probably had  been fucking  I think  and right when  she got up  to sniff  he figured  he'd sock her  in the old  olfactory  section of  the brain  that's right 
[03:02:30]  she smelled  stars  and fucking  blood  and pine  salt  from the  bathroom  floor  after she  hit the  old  deck  a room  smell and  taste of  something very  metallic  I think it's  blood  police saw  bruises and  red marks on  the victim's  mouth  legs and arms  she became  uncooperative  when told a  warrant would be  filed for her  husband's arrest  uncooperative  one of those  yeah  take away my  man  that's amazing  well the 
[03:03:00]  great thing  would have  been if his  dick smelled  like shit  let me go to  Dan in North  Carolina  Dan  Dan  hey man  hi Dan  yeah there's a  song on YouTube  smell your dick  yeah  is it a good  song  it's on YouTube  a few people are  saying it's a pretty  funny song  alright we'll check  it out  I don't think  I don't  I don't think  I've heard that  one  it's like the  Justin Timberlake  one about  dick in a box  yuck  uh

[03:07:00]  out  of  it  it's  not  real  it's  not  a  real  dick  it's  like  fucking  unless  it  can  possibly  shoot  semen  at you  yeah  told Steve  before  you eat  out  with  plastic  utensils  it's  the same  stuff  going  in  your  mouth  would  you  be  more  comfortable  with  a  condom  on  no  what  would  you  do  if  it's  removed  yeah  I'll do  the  no  I was  just  saying  that  dude  that was  just  an  example  of  it's  just  plastic  it  didn't  mean  that  was  an  option  right 
[03:07:30]  see  you'll  suck  the  dick  no  but  I'm  saying  it's  just  plastic  it's  the  same  thing  if  you'll  suck  the  tit  then  you'll  suck  the  dick  no  I  won't  why  wouldn't  you  suck  the  dick  show  look  look  how  easy  it  because  it  is  plastic  you  can  just  rub  the  nipple  right  you  don't  even  have  to  look  down  jimmy  see  look  how  easy  this  is  see  you  just  chew  on  the  nipple  because  it's  plastic  you  don't  even  look  down 
[03:08:00]  and  he  doesn't  have  to  worry  about  taking  the  dick  off  you  could  look  down  if  you  want  to  but  you  don't  have  to  there  you  here  eric  come on  what are  you doing  here  that's what  they're  making us  do to  them  anyway  yeah  alright  now you  take on  that other  nipple  with the  dick  still on  the  doll  yeah

[03:30:30]  no use for you  can you get a special delivery  right in your mouth  right now  right  nothing shoots out of this  it's plastic  and not gay  right  right  what was it  what makes it gay  if it shoots semen  if it shoots semen  yeah  and this does not do that  and I wanna hear some yummy noises  you show some appreciation  for that gift  wait why don't we have uh  are interns allowed to still hold microphones  when we're doing outrageous uh  bits  Sam can't be holding his own microphone  Travis the intern 
[03:31:00]  good  thanks Travis  alright  you want Lily to play Sam's wife  so we have a whole cuckold thing  yeah you know what  that's a damn good idea  cuckold  we haven't used Lily  this is so sexy enough  I'm just trying to bring it out of the gay zone  just a little  oh really  I know we're not gonna clear  completely out of the gay zone  but  Sam I'm so ashamed of you 
[03:31:30]  wait uh  Jimmy will uh  no no you're through the whole cuckold  you and Sam are a couple  okay  now  Sam hasn't been fucking you properly  because of his small genitals  so what happens is uh  Eric the bull has been brought over  and um  what Sam's job is to do  is to prep the bull  is to  is to moisten it up  and get it nice and wet  right  so that the real man  can service you  while the husband watches  right  so you have to command your husband  to prep that bull  and suck that cock  you have to  you have to  you're the boss  stroke the shaft Sam 
[03:32:00]  wait can I jump in on this scenario  so then like  Sam as the husband of Lily  yeah  starts sucking the bull's cock  yeah  she gets so annoyed  grabs the cock  out of  her husband's hand  and really devours that cock  and  and then  Sam being the  the husband  starts weeping  openly  okay  that's uh  pretty good scenario  is that alright Jimmy  is that kind of a cuck holding  um  you wanted like  a modify  a cuck wife  would probably 
[03:32:30]  I have peanut butter  in my mouth  lucky me  right Sam  I don't know  if the wife  would grab it  and suck it  okay  um  I don't think  Lily wants to  would you  I would just live  vicariously  through my husband  she would only  take it in the push  from the bull  well  it can't happen  of course not  nope  can't  can't 
[03:33:00]  alright let's go back  to the original scenario  the bottom line is  she can certainly  command the husband  to get to service  alright  that's good  alright  there's a mic over there  she had her hand  in the back of  Fruits head  well I just want to  make sure you get  close enough  yeah  Sammy  what  oh  I like this  gently start in  first  with what  your mouth  alright 
[03:33:30]  on the bull's cock  open  uh  no  tongue  open  it's in there  take it  uh  uh  uh  uh  there you go  uh  you're not even  doing anything  nope  you gotta rest  on your teeth  tell them to take it  it's not a dentist  Sam  come on  uh huh  wrap your mouth  around the head  wrap it around the head 
[03:34:00]  all the head  inside  now feel how  feel the soft  feel the soft bridges  oh my god  part of this  I gotta jump in  the best part of this  is E-Rock  trying to go to a safe  no E-Rock's trying to keep  his real dick  from popping up  all of a sudden  the fake dick  goes a-flying  flying across the room  get back in  get back in there  back in huh 
[03:34:30]  yeah  alright  uh  don't bite it  don't bite it  just tongue  only tongue  okay  mmm  yeah you like that  that's how you  it's flat  alright now  start sliding up and down  a little bit  oh  stop making those noises  don't  bro don't be like  you don't enjoy it  mmm  mmm  yeah  E-Rock

[03:40:00]  it's a weird thing  all presidents  allow some grey  come in  yeah  yeah  it was a joke  there  yeah  it was a big  one there  yeah  what  that he's letting  the greys come in  yeah  it's a color joke  oh  I know  I'm just trying  to figure it out  well he's letting  the greys come in  we're letting the  and we  well  yeah  that's kind of  the joke  it's uh  it's inappropriate  racist  and horrible  and unsayable  on the radio  Paul on Long Island 
[03:40:30]  what did you learn  on the Opie and Anthony  show  brought to you  by DirecTV  yes  I learned it's not  gay if it doesn't  come  I don't know  if we taught you that  it's not gay  if it's  if it can't  right  yeah  if it has the  potential to come  I don't want  but you just don't  let it come  I don't want  that's still gay  I don't want some  of our listeners  to be called  gay on a  technicality  out there  if you're  sucking a dick  but you don't 
[03:41:00]  suck it up  until the point  it comes  it's still  pretty gay  right  that's what  we gave  that  Matt and Buffalo  well tomato  tomato  and  how about  those dopey  bills of yours  oh what about  them  they're doing  good aren't they  no they're not  my friend  they started  off nice  though  they started  off nice  and now  they're  now they're  nice  there you go  what did you  learn on the  show today  I learned  it only takes  two fingers  to pop the  asphalt chair  of a tranny  top  yeah  Sam did that  like a pro  like a champ  went  pop  and for all the 
[03:41:30]  people saying  that the show  is really gay  today  the only reason  we're playing  what did we learn  I wanted to see  if you fuckers  were still with us  and boy are they  no one's leaving  that bit  John Chicago  I learned  that Jimmy  refuses to  help me  take the gay  out of the show  I did try  Jimmy  we don't have  much gay  in this show  but now  we need some  not to that  magnitude  we gotta get  some real guys  in here to  make out  and do  uncomfortable  gay things  telling you  it's time to  take it up a notch  is it  yes 
[03:42:00]  time to take it  up a notch  with our gayness  no no no  that's sort of  the gayness  with discomfort  yeah  with discomfort  oh yeah  let's say hi  to Jeremy  in Cleveland  Jeremy  hey boys  hey by the way  the hometown  of that  face chick  yep  that we talked  about today  oh she's  from Cleveland  yes  what's up  Jeremy  I learned  I learned  that Big A's  blood is slowly  trying to escape  his body  yeah  you know what  we should do  we should reenact 
[03:42:30]  something I had  to do  oh  marshmallows  the marshmallow  bit  we should reenact  the marshmallow  bit for huge  prizes  I agree  if you really  want to take  it up a notch  there Jimmy  yep  we could do  official  fraternity  pledging stuff  on our show  I'll be a part  of that  you would do  uh  bombing of the  marshmallows  yeah  I don't like to  say the name  of the fraternity  put marshmallows  up your asshole  please  no you don't  put them up  your asshole  you gotta put  them in your  ass crack  I thought  someone had  a fist  with marshmallows  in the nut  it wasn't bad 
[03:43:00]  enough  you kind of  just had to  pick them up  without using  your hand  oh yeah  that's right  and then you  waddle across  the room  and you drop  it on the  rival fraternity  house  it's like the  Caligula  fucking  marshmallow  challenge  he dips  his fist  in  marshmallow  mush  just  rams it  yes  he names  the name  of the  people of  Rome  we're getting  ready to get  out of here  but Joe  and Shirley  yes  hey what's up  guys  hey

[03:44:30]  Steve in New York  Steve what did  you learn  on the show  what  I learned  that they  used to call  Little Jimmy  the Pussycup Kid  the Pussycup Kid  that's right  that's a good nickname  love that name  he said I love that name  that should be the name  of your third book  the Pussycup Kid  Pussycup Kid  it's about  it's about a child  who kind of goes around  like Johnny Appleseed  and fucking  and pussies  eat oats  out of his hand  like horse lips  by the way  that reminded me  of something  if I could plug

[03:45:30]  just he was a rock star  in Allentown  then they hired him  for the Buffalo thing  when I was up there  and then he moved  back home  after that  he's been there  ever since  yeah sure  I think I met him  when he was in Buffalo  he's done easily  20 plus years  of radio in Allentown  easily  when we were  off the air  I think when I went  up to Buffalo  I actually did  the Bear Man show  I'm always positive  are you sure in 2002  yeah  that name is familiar  he was long gone  we all got fired  in 90  wow 
[03:46:00]  93-ish  but did he go  to another Buffalo station  92-ish  90  somewhere  somewhere around there  I don't think so  oh no you're right  you're right  you're right  I don't think so  alright  why don't we get  out of here  right right  right right  that's all for today guys  alright  Friday tomorrow  is it really  I think so  tomorrow morning  at 10am  tickets for my final  January 18th  Borgata show  go on sale  ticket man  or the Borgata.com  so if you want  to go see me  if not  you don't have to  see these guys  get confused  with story of the year  they're messing up
