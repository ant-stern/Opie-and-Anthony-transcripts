<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie detailing his debilitating acid reflux, his various unsuccessful treatments (including a colonoscopy), and his continued coffee addiction despite the pain.  The hosts engaged in vulgar and humorous tangents related to GERD, incorporating listener suggestions for Opie's condition, such as ginger root and elevating his bed.  They then transitioned to a discussion of a *Globe* magazine photo depicting Gary Coleman's deathbed scene, speculating on the ex-wife's demeanor and the possibility of foul play.  An unrelated *Globe* article about Al Gore was also briefly discussed.  Upcoming guests Bill Burr, Jim Jefferies, Victoria Zadrach, and the Iron Sheik were mentioned, with humorous predictions about the latter two's likely intoxication.  The segment concluded with listener stories: one about an awkward sushi restaurant experience and another about a John Cazale documentary.

The show continued with a discussion of the Chicago Blackhawks' Stanley Cup victory, quickly veering into a racially insensitive conversation about hockey fan demographics and the potential for riots. A caller countered with the example of Canadian hockey fans' riotous celebrations.  The hosts then mocked a video of Jeremy Roenick crying on television after the win.  The conversation shifted to various radio personalities, focusing on Bruce Kelly's work in Fargo, North Dakota, with attempts to play a segment from his show hampered by technical difficulties attributed to their sound technician, "Sex Bagel."  These technical issues continued, preventing the playing of a John Sterling home run call.  Despite the difficulties, they managed to play a clip of a woman struggling with the Google Pac-Man game, followed by a successful interview with John Sterling himself discussing his career and famous call. The segment ended with several voicemails and a live call from Bobo, a listener who had brought disruptive friends to Jim Norton's show.  Bobo's rambling apologies culminated in a graphically described masturbatory fantasy involving Anthony Cumia's ex-girlfriend, Melinda, as a form of punishment for his actions.

The next segment heavily featured Bobo and his unusual "hot chick list," including celebrities and a list of men he'd sleep with for access to them (including Fez from *That '70s Show*, Master Shake's voice actor, Bob Kelly, Barack Obama, and Jim Norton).  Listener emails detailed Bobo's disruptive behavior at a comedy show, leading to his suspension.  The hosts offered advice and even gave Bobo Melinda's phone number off-air.  The conversation branched out to include a 13-year-old using offensive language on the *Today Show*, the deaths of Gary Coleman and a listener's friend, ash disposal issues, Jim Jefferies's past intoxicated appearances and Holocaust jokes, taxidermy, and a caller's bizarre experience scattering ashes at a college.  Bill Burr and Jim Jefferies appeared in studio, contributing to these discussions.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of a comedian's controversial statements, followed by a debate on pornography preferences.  This transitioned to a video of an enthusiastic drummer at a low-key gig.  Bill Burr was in studio, and Jim Jefferies' upcoming shows were promoted.  A disastrous interview with the Iron Sheik ended with him abruptly leaving the studio after a phone call from Jay Moore.  The hosts and guests extensively discussed this incident and the Sheik's apparent personality shift.  The conversation included digressions into various sports and cultural differences between the US and Australia.

The final segment featured a chaotic and unexpected phone call with the Iron Sheik, who was revealed to be unwell and angry.  The hosts attempted damage control and discussed the Sheik's Twitter account, managed by others.  They reminisced about other wrestlers they'd hosted, including the Bushwhackers and Mr. Fuji.  Bill Burr's tour dates were promoted.  Discussions included the Tasmanian genocide, Burr's views on Australians, the stock market (specifically BP), George "The Animal" Steele, and a listener's anecdote about witnessing the Moondogs wrestle.  Jay Moore was identified as the instigator of the Sheik's outburst.  A recording of a post-walk-off conversation with the Sheik was played.  The conversation touched upon past walk-offs by Jesse Ventura and The Rock, including The Rock's reaction to a racist comment.  The show concluded with listener calls, including a 911 call seeking a husband, a tree fire report, and final plugs for the guests' upcoming performances.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show up.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks. 
[00:04:00]  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  Here they are.  Hi.  Hi, everyone.  Hello.  That's better.  Ah.  What is it?  Thursday?  Thursday, right?  Nice. 
[00:04:30]  T-G-I-T.  I call it the other Friday.  Oh.  The other Friday.  I like that.  Yeah, because with Friday being tomorrow, you could kind of be a little more irresponsible  on a Thursday than you could on, let's say, a Monday.  Or a Tuesday or a Wednesday.  That is true, man.  The weekend used to start on Thursdays.  Yeah.  What it is.  And then you get a little older, and I don't know.  Maybe you're still starting the weekend on Thursdays.  Well, if it's late. 
[00:05:00]  It's a late start.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I kind of like a nice, I don't know, Tuesday start to the weekend.  I'm fucking, I'm back, but I'm fucking hurting.  I'm back.  I want to talk about acid reflux for a few minutes.  Acid reflux.  That should be some fun for everybody.  Are you taking ass?  There should be a lot of laughs for everybody.  Ass effects.  I'm taking ass effects.  I'm taking, now I.  Worst name for medicine ever, by the way. 
[00:05:30]  I moved on to prefacid.  Prefacid.  I got Zantac, I think.  I got one of those in my pocket.  Is it Zantac prescription?  No.  It used to be.  Used to be.  It's OTC now.  That's right.  OTC, baby.  Over the counter.  Have you tried Nexium, dude?  Huh?  Have you tried Nexium?  I got to go back to my GI.  I don't know what to do anymore.  He suggested ass effects.  Um, I got my, my, my Lanta.  And then Anthony noticed.  My doctor said my Lanta.  Then Anthony noticed that I'm drinking coffee, which is probably the worst thing for what 
[00:06:00]  I'm going through right now.  The worst.  You could drink muriatic acid and it's probably not as bad as coffee when you have that.  I'm so addicted to coffee.  I need to drink this.  Need your coffee.  But every sip is like excruciating pain.  Do you know that's like a fucking crackhead or a heroin addict doing it after they know  it's bad for them?  Yes, I know.  You saw me.  Look, look how much coffee I've, I've had two sips and I want more. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I'm just staring at this.  That's exactly how crack is.  Because I'm addicted to goddamn coffee.  I want more.  I know.  And a large, dude.  Why not get a small?  Oh, that's a big cup of coffee.  I'm not going to drink any of it because it's, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'll be fine.  I won't be a buzzkill, but for just a couple of minutes, uh, I get this fucking acid reflux  and I, I went to a GI guy.  I got scoped.  Joe?  Huh?  Joe?  Yes.  Because that would be silly.  I got fucking scoped.  Remember?  Because it was the propofol thing we talked about on the show. 
[00:07:00]  And everything's fine.  A lot of irritation.  And he goes, yep, you got acid reflux.  No real damage.  Stay on the acid reflux.  So I, I did.  And then, like, all my symptoms went away to the point, like, why am I taking this shit?  And I've been off it for at least three or four months.  At least.  Maybe longer.  That's what people do with Zoloft.  And then they kill people.  Yeah, yeah.  You're probably right.  I feel fine.  You're probably right.  And then last Wednesday, it started.  I've been miserable for about a week.  How's opiate gallbladder?  I don't know.  I got to get that checked out today. 
[00:07:30]  And all of a sudden, I get an attack.  And then something happens where all this medicine that I just mentioned, none of it  works because it's too late.  I don't understand medically.  You can't take it, like, except for my Lantus stuff.  It usually takes a few days in your system.  Yeah.  To calm everything down.  To shut the acid pumps off.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  But then all of a sudden, the acid pumps are like, fuck you.  And just, just wreak havoc in your whole system.  The acid goes all the way up because I had a sore throat.  I'm like, I'm getting sick.  I wasn't getting sick. 
[00:08:00]  It was the acid just fucking irritating the back of my throat and irritating my windpipe  and my esophagus and possibly went down into my lungs because now I'm like, like, I want  to catch my breath.  Acid in your lungs?  I guess.  You're digesting your lungs?  Basically, my body's digesting itself in front of your eyes.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  So, it's sort of gone.  I'm having, like, just slight flare-ups today.  But the damage is done.  Now it all has to heal because it's basically burning your skin, burning your flesh, the 
[00:08:30]  acid.  This acid shit is serious business.  Yeah.  When you think of what it does, like, it takes meat and everything.  Right.  It just turns it into a mushy stuff that gets absorbed.  Why does it stay where it's supposed to?  Why does it have to move all the way up your system and wreak fucking havoc everywhere?  Where it's not supposed to be.  Did you try ginger?  Did it make you not be able to breathe deep?  Like, I feel like if I breathe deep, I could pop, like, what feels like a gas pocket. 
[00:09:00]  But when I breathe deep, it hurts probably right where the gallbladder is on the right  side.  So, I don't know.  I took ginger root a couple of times.  I have to go to a doctor again.  Everyone's saying ginger.  Ginger ale.  It helps.  Kenny, get me some ginger ale.  The ginger root pills I took, 550 milligrams, the secretary recommended.  Right.  They actually helped pretty instantly.  Did you talk to Dr. Steve?  Oh, my God.  Me and Dr. Steve are like butt buddies at this point.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Texting and calling.  I'm like, will you help me?  I'm begging you.  I haven't slept in a day.  Tell me.  Because then you get the nice day off yesterday. 
[00:09:30]  I'm up at five anyway because I can't fucking sleep.  I can't fucking sleep.  I'm like, I'll just sleep this off.  Propping the pillows up.  Steve's like, well, you're going to have to get bricks for your bed.  So, it's like a little higher.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  That's going to make for a very romantic marriage.  Hold on, honey.  Let me get my fucking cinder block so I don't get acid reflux tonight.  I got to sleep like the elephant man.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Don't mind me propped up like a grandpa next to you. 
[00:10:00]  Pat from Monaki wants to know if you drank Dr. Steve's wine.  That might be the problem.  Fuck.  I should try that.  I've tried everything else.  It will.  Imagine that's the cure.  That's the cure all.  Dr. Steve indirectly has the greatest cure for acid reflux with his shitty wine.  Use baking soda.  No offense to everybody, and I know you mean well.  I've heard all this stuff.  Home remedies.  See, NXIVM's coming in again.  Baking soda.  Another ginger's coming in. 
[00:10:30]  Fuck.  My gums are like irritated from the acid.  How the fuck far is that going?  Well, if you're laying down, I guess it kind of like, it decides to pour right out.  And is it just like the gases from the acid burns away at it?  I'm no fucking doctor.  Because I can't imagine that the acid itself is going into your mouth.  That's fucked up.  Oh yeah, it definitely goes to the back of your throat.  It comes all the way up.  Oh yeah, and bad cases.  See, there's a million people out there that could totally relate to this.  What the fuck is that about? 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  That sounds like a design flaw from God.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's another one of God's design flaws.  I was telling Anthony before the show, I should have taped it, but I've had this issue my entire  life, but when you're one of seven kids, sometimes nine kids, sometimes ten kids, depending on  who needs a house to live in, no one went to the fucking doctor.  You just dealt with your pains and aches, aches and pains, whatever.  Yeah, I never got taken up to the doctor.  I remember being 12, 13, having horrible acid reflux.  Now I know what that was.  It's like walk it off kind of a thing? 
[00:11:30]  Of course.  Of course.  No dentist.  That's why I have fucking a million cavities in my mouth.  Had to get those pulled out to get the white ones in so it looks like I don't have cavities.  Were you like a little white trash family out there on Long Island?  I don't know if we were white trash.  My mom had a money issue, hence why I have it at times.  At times.  Were you worried about running out of money?  Yeah, so.  Oh yeah, she was obsessed that we were going to be living on the street. 
[00:12:00]  I'm like, fuck, let's live on the street.  It sounds like a better life.  Was it a step up?  Yes.  I'll fucking become a hobo, take the first train out of Huntington.  No reason to take that route.  Yeah.  Are you, this guy wants to know if I'm having problems sleeping.  What do you think?  What the fuck do you think?  I slept, I think, six hours in the last week between a kid and acid reflux.  What do you think?  No, I'm sleeping like a baby.  Fuck. 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  Now you got ginger ale.  I would think the bubbles would hurt.  Everything hurts going down.  I mean everything.  I'm trying to eat this fucking oatmeal.  I got to try that.  That might be nice and soothing.  Yeah, coat the fucking throat.  Yes, you need some coating.  Someone's saying I got the GERD.  What's GERD?  GERD?  Do you know what GERD is?  Is it an acronym?  Is that kind of like mud?  Is that like mud?  What is GERD?  GERD.  Is that the next step above acid reflux? 
[00:13:00]  GERD.  GERD just sounds awful.  Yeah, you don't want GERD.  You don't want GERD, right?  Is that gastric reflux disease?  No.  Gastric?  I had everything checked out.  The guy's like, yeah, man, you got bad acid reflux, but that's it.  That's what I'm going to fucking diagnose you as having.  GERD is like shingles?  What the fuck is GERD?  The shingles.  How many GERDs does it take to shingle a roof?  No, shingles.  I don't even say that. 
[00:13:30]  That's what happens, like, if Steve is assaulted, someone, the police will say they've been  GERD.  GERD.  GERD.  Can we have a sad show today?  Because the laughing is really going to hurt.  Yeah.  We'll have a sad show.  Can we just think of very sad subjects and talk about those today?  Because, oh, it fucking hurts.  Yeah, see, look at this.  Oscar in Indiana.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, brother, I feel for you, man. 
[00:14:00]  I know you think the bricks under the bed sounds fucking corny, but it's the only thing that  helped me, man.  The only thing.  How do bricks in your bed help?  Because you're supposed to keep your body elevated so the acid doesn't get all the way  up your system, man, and it stays closer down where it's supposed to be.  So why use bricks and not pillows or something?  Well, yeah.  You know what, sir?  I got a really hot wife.  I'm not going to bring bricks home and go, excuse me, but I have to readjust our bed because  I'm an old fuck with acid reflux.  I'd rather suffer in the middle of the night. 
[00:14:30]  Doubled over in pain than have bricks propping up my headboard.  That's got to be a treat rolling over and feeling a fucking brick.  Right.  I guess you put the bricks under the bed and lift everything up.  Yeah.  Roger, put them under your pillow.  Under your pillow?  Does it go on top of the bed?  Under the bed?  No, under the post.  Under the bed.  So it's slightly elevated.  Oh, God.  That sounds dangerous as fuck.  Especially if you're having some of that good old fucking.  Yeah.  You need, why wouldn't you just get like a craftmatic adjustable bed? 
[00:15:00]  Really?  Thanks, Mars.  I mean, if anyone's going to lift their bed up, then you might as well just get the craftmatic  adjustable bed.  You realize that that's something for the elderly?  That's a hospital bed in your house.  You realize I'd rather die?  I have to elevate my feet or I get the gout.  If you're Otto's joke, how you can suck your own cock in a craftmatic thing, he goes, set  it on eight. 
[00:15:30]  Don't go any higher or you'll hurt yourself.  That's really funny.  Mine and you snap your fucking neck or something?  Let's go to Dennis in Hoboken.  Dennis.  Hoboken?  What's up?  What's up?  You have GERD.  I have it too.  GERD stands for, yeah, gastroesophageal reflux disease.  It's when the pumps, the acid pumps in your stomach don't stop.  And you should try a drug called Dexalant.  I take it.  It's like a really high powered form of like Prevacid or Nexium. 
[00:16:00]  I'll add it to the list.  I don't know what the fuck to do.  Drug named heroin.  It doesn't help, but it takes your mind off.  Heroin, too.  Oh, sir.  All right.  So I have GERD.  Yeah, I stepped on him.  It begins with a D when he said the drug.  A D.  Dexium.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Let's go to Paul in Massachusetts.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hi.  Oh, Uncle.  Paulie.  Hello.  What's up? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I had the same thing.  And it got so bad that it inflamed my esophagus.  Couldn't swallow food.  It would lock right in the top of my throat.  Oh, yeah.  Two Prilosec a day cures it.  Two what a day?  Prilosec.  Prilosec.  Prilosec.  Do you got that?  No, I don't have that.  Look over your pharmacy counter over there.  I take the prescription strength, bud.  How about one person call and say the Prevacid that I just bought yesterday is going to work?  Because that's what I'm on now.  Is that over the counter? 
[00:17:00]  OTC, brother.  I don't over the counter stuff.  You got to get a prescription or something?  No, man.  There's something going on at the CVS's of the world, man.  They're moving a lot of things to OTC.  Some of the OTC, you got to go to the actual pharmacist, but it's there for you.  You got to do that with Valium.  Huh?  They got to start doing that with Valium.  Half this shit was all prescription only a year or two ago, but it's all going OTC.  All the stuff now, because they can't fit it in the back.  There's all the stuff you can make meth out of.  I know.  They have to hide that shit. 
[00:17:30]  All the histamines.  Histamines.  I told you about the bricks, too, but I said I didn't put the bricks on me.  Yeah, you know, if you're...  I didn't prop myself up on pillows.  Exactly.  If you're a man, you don't fucking put bricks under your fucking bedpost so you can get  a better night's sleep.  Maybe you prop yourself up with a few extra pillows, but no bricks.  No bricks.  Dr. Steve actually suggested that, too.  Did he?  Yeah.  Put bricks under your bed.  Jimmy, you get this, right?  Yeah, but it's not that bad.  And NXIVM, I take NXIVM every day. 
[00:18:00]  But I've had a couple of...  Last few days, it's bothered me, even with my NXIVM.  So the receptionist and I talked, she said ginger root, and I took them, and they worked  pretty quickly.  Well, some people said that ginger ale will work just as well.  No?  No, ginger root is a lot more constant.  That sounds like an Asian cure.  I fucking hate ginger, though.  Take the pill.  I like the sushi, but I've never liked the fucking ginger.  I love that ginger.  It's good for your digestion.  You like ginger?  Love it, yeah.  Very spicy.  Shushi meat, peaches, and guacamole. 
[00:18:30]  I said, don't make me laugh.  I ate blowfish last night at the fucking sushi place.  You what?  I said, I blew eight fish.  They were so grateful.  Eight vagotas smiling.  Yes.  You blew.  I blew fish.  You actually tried blowfish?  It was one of the things I got at this place that I go to that you just order and they  give you what they give you.  Is it the place that, uh, near the, near a, near a, near a, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  By the thing, but not that far.  Oh, by the thing.  A place where you go to check out other stuff across the street?  Yeah.  It's across the street from that.  Oh.  Where you can't really order?  Or you can sort of order?  This is also mysterious.  I say, let me have this option.  They give you like 12 pieces.  Look at that.  I'm doing, me and Jimmy are now just doing a show for each other.  Oh, oh.  Somewhere around there?  Yeah.  And, uh, it was, uh.  It's the most amazing fucking place.  Uh. 
[00:19:30]  Hmm.  No?  It begins with, uh, here.  An A?  I don't know why it's a big secret.  It's just a sushi place.  It's not like it's.  That was where it is.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, I, one of the, one of the things was blowfish.  I'm like, well, can I die from eating this?  Yeah, yeah.  Why would they have it on the menu if you could die from it?  Because they have to be, the guy's like, yeah, you need a special license to prepare  it because you can.  So, someone could fuck up in the back?  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't take that chance.  So, I said, I'm a little nervous.  I'm not going to eat this.  Good for you.  Um, but he goes to the back and he goes, I talked to the manager, he goes, there's two  types of blowfish. 
[00:20:00]  One that does have a poison and he goes, one that does not.  We don't serve the stuff with the poison.  This doesn't have it.  He goes, but I'll take it back if you want.  I'm like, no, I'll eat it.  And I ate it.  Ah, man.  You're, you're brave.  My girlfriend was, uh.  It's the fugu, I think, is the bad one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fugu.  You know this?  I know it now.  Oh.  I was trying to sound smart, but somebody popped it up there.  I texted Dr. Steve, how long after you eat blowfish?  Will you die?  Yeah, because I had just eaten it, so I wanted to make sure if it's two hours, I was going  to kind of panic, but if it was within 10 minutes, I'm like, I can handle it for 10  minutes. 
[00:20:30]  Dr. Steve.  Why eat something if you worry it's going to kill you?  It really was good.  Yeah?  Was it good?  What does it taste like?  I couldn't describe any fish.  It was just good.  I mean, like, it was, it had a distinctive flavor.  Really?  Yeah.  Dr. Steve gets the weirdest calls from all of us.  You don't like fish?  Did I fart?  No, I did not.  Oh, Mars is farting in here now.  Oh, wow.  Mars' head's all shiny this morning like a piece of wax fruit.  I know it smelled ethnic.  Huh?  It smelled ethnic?  Wax fruit. 
[00:21:00]  What did you have for dinner last night, Mars?  Some of those, some of those banana things that don't look like fucking bananas.  Oh, protein shit.  Oh, plantains.  Plantains.  Oh, they're terrible.  Yeah, like, fuck, they almost look delicious like a banana one.  Cleverly disguised as a banana.  Right.  Worst fucking, I don't even know what it is.  Is it a fruit?  What is it?  A fruit?  Oh, it's horrible, dude.  It's a fruit.  It's a banana.  Like, plantain.  No, that's not a banana.  It's not a banana.  It's bitter or something like that.  It sucks.  Delicious.  You got to fry them up. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  What you do, slice them thin and fry them.  Everything tastes delicious if you fry it up.  You fry the green ones, and then the ripe ones, I think you boil them some shadow now.  Who wants a boiled fucking banana thing?  How about you just get a banana?  Yeah.  Cut it off over some fruit.  It's sweet.  Start behaving.  Yeah.  Start behaving.  Jesus.  I can't believe you tried blowfish. 
[00:22:00]  That's fucked up.  I wouldn't have eaten it had it been the other one.  I would not have eaten it had it been the poison one.  I would have sent it back.  You're just way too trusting that they didn't get the wrong blowfish.  If you ask about it, to me, no place would serve it to you.  If you're concerned, they would just take it back.  It's like, he needed the money.  One guy had a fuck up between the guy catching it on his fishing line.  Yeah.  Then he gives it to somebody else, and they pack it, then they ship it, then... 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  It could have fucked up somewhere.  No fucking way, man.  Unless they look different.  Then there could be a disgruntled guy that says, yeah, I know this is the poison blowfish.  I'm putting one in with the good ones.  Yeah.  No way, man.  No fucking way.  It just doesn't sound like...  Just because it exists doesn't mean you have to eat it.  That's true.  It's like the blowfish doesn't look appetizing.  Well, neither does.  Sea urchin is good.  No, it isn't.  Sea urchin.  Isn't it snot?  Dude, I love sea urchin.  I used to eat it in a zela.  Which one is the sea urchin?  The one that tastes like a...  Yeah, that shit is horrible.  Isn't it like snot? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has the consistency of like...  Yeah.  I like it.  Thick snot.  Oh.  I like it.  The thick, mucusy snot.  You really do?  Yeah, I do.  I don't know anyone that likes that.  I don't like the little salmon, the juicy little orange eggs, the big ones, I can't  eat them.  No, I can't eat the fucking roe.  No, I don't like that either.  No.  But this I like.  Sea urchin I like.  Yeah, I do like it.  We make people eat sea urchin when we go to sushi joints just to get the reaction.  We pay people and stuff because it's that bad. 
[00:23:30]  That is fucking disgusting.  The orange part is what you eat.  No, I know.  No, you don't.  Yeah, you do.  It's good.  Nazawa got me into it.  I eat anything he gives me because I know it's not going to get me sick.  But he probably gets nice, fresh fucking sea urchin.  The sea urchin is alive when you get there.  You're talking to him.  Yeah, I guess you could get nice, fresh sea urchin in New York City as well.  Shishi.  Shishi meat.  Shishi meat, peaches, and guacamole.  She's friendly, Lee.  What do we have here?  The building blocks of shishi. 
[00:24:00]  Shishi meat, peaches, and guacamole.  Wasabi.  It's wasabi.  What's up?  Wasabi.  It's not that hard.  To let other people from other countries talk to you.  What is that?  It is one of the most bizarre things that is happening.  I don't know why he's doing this.  John C. Reilly does this character on Adult Swim.  It's like the late night cartoon network.  Yeah.  called Dr. Steve Brule. 
[00:24:30]  It's hysterical.  Where he's just like this local news segment guy.  He's just like the local doctor guy in this awful fictional place in the 80s somewhere.  They send him out on these locations to do these reports and he's just like this retarded guy pretty much.  But he's like a real actor.  What is he doing?  It's one of those things where it's like sometimes you're not sure if it's funny and it has to just like sit with you for a little while until you decide.  And then it becomes hysterical.  It's absolutely funny. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  The one with his wine.  The wine.  What?  There's a whole bunch of them online?  Sweet Bay wine.  He's all drunk.  Give me some more though.  Let me say hi to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt has something on the sea urchin.  Matt.  Hey guys.  Hey.  The only way I can describe a sea urchin is if you're out by the sea, it tastes like low tide.  It's just fucking terrible.  I would have to agree with Matt.  Yes.  Very salty.  You're right.  I would have to agree.  This doesn't sound tasty and delectable.  Well, there's not many people that eat the sea urchin in it.  I don't know why I like it.  Not many people eat it.  Giant clam I love.  Oh, the chewy thing, dude. 
[00:25:30]  Well, you've talked about that before.  Puffy, right?  Big clit.  I love clams.  The fucking Japanese giant clam or whatever it's called.  You can't.  It's like eating a tongue.  Not that I know what eating a tongue's like.  Yeah.  You can't get through it.  Nazawa fucking serves that.  I'll eat a giant clam.  He could just put one in his asshole and shit it in my mouth and I'd eat it.  Fucking best thing ever.  Giant red clam or something like that?  I don't know.  I've ever eaten that one.  It's really tough, Ant.  Yeah.  It's tough to even bite through it.  And then when you do get in your mouth, you can't fucking swallow it.  You can't chew it down. 
[00:26:00]  Put a leaf on it.  It comes with a little leaf.  Oh, it's horrible.  It's horrible.  Why don't you just eat the tuna?  I like the tuna.  By the way, that place you go to?  Yeah.  Order the tuna special.  They prepare tuna in like six or seven different ways.  It's amazing.  And my girl gets that.  I prefer the other one where they just give me everything.  You know what tuna I love?  Bumblebee on a sandwich.  I'm not a big...  You know how horrible that tuna is compared to sushi tuna?  Dude, really?  I mean...  The fucking mercury tastes great.  Oh, yeah, mercury.  It's good.  I'm like a fucking... 
[00:26:30]  I'm like one of those goddamn switches they put in bombs.  I think all that alcohol...  I think the alcohol you drink just fucking takes care of all your fucking...  Burns it away.  Yeah, because I think I'm going to start drinking heavily.  I would never speak out against that.  I got a lot of stress illnesses, so if I start drinking heavily, I won't stress as much,  and then my illnesses will go away.  No.  Huh?  No, you wouldn't.  You're just nice and even keel until you feel like shit the next day, but what are you going to do? 
[00:27:00]  Do you have high mercury?  No.  I know I do.  My mercury is through the roof.  I've got to stop at the sushi.  Who tests for mercury?  I got tested in my doctor, and it was like...  Did you ask for it?  I forget.  She just did a general test on everything, like for blood and stuff.  But I don't think they automatically test for mercury.  A five is normal, and mine was in the 30s, I think.  It was really bad.  Whatever it was.  I don't remember.  It was bad.  Was it the cleavage doctor?  Yeah.  Nice.  Tits McGillicuddy, I call her.  Tits MD.  Dr. Tits McGillicuddy to you, sir. 
[00:27:30]  She's pregnant and still showing off her cleavage.  Is she pregnant?  And still showing off her cleavage.  We have this...  Me and Jimmy share a doctor.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's almost a little gay, though.  No, it's a Russian brud.  Yeah.  And she has a blouse, and she likes to have a few extra buttons unbuttoned.  Really?  Does she have the accent and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I swear to God, you're convinced half the time she's hitting on you.  How old a brud is she?  Not that old.  I don't know.  35, maybe? 
[00:28:00]  Hard to tell.  Wow.  She's...  Yeah.  She's 35.  Right.  She has her own practice.  Very sexy.  She's got to be...  But she closes that door, and then you're looking at this cleavage, and the blouse is  down a little too far.  You're like, I think this fucking girl is going to, like...  I don't know, man.  She'd be able to just fucking...  I swear to God.  If you're going to grab your balls and make you cough and things like that, you should  be able to just grab her tits while she's doing it.  She told me...  Great would that be?  She told me once that I was a good specimen.  I swear to God.  I'm like, what the hell's going on in this doctor's office? 
[00:28:30]  What the hell, dude?  Maybe she's not even a doctor.  Maybe this is like a front for something else.  Specimen.  She actually said that.  She goes, you're a good specimen, especially for your age.  You're a really good specimen.  She said...  I'm a specimen.  She said nothing like that to me.  No?  She said, here, sit in this Petri dish.  It's humiliating.  Oh, you want to know what happens if you eat the poisonous blowfish, Jim?  Yes.  Chris in the Poconos.  Hey, yeah.  If you eat the poisonous one, you actually get a numb tingle in your mouth because the 
[00:29:00]  poison is already in the flesh from the fish.  Now, how long...  What exactly does it...  Dr. Steve texted that.  He said you get a numbness.  What happens from there?  I don't know because I only saw it on TV and I'm repeating it.  You get a numbness just from eating it?  You should be in radio, sir.  Yeah, from what they say, you actually get a numbness in your whole mouth, kind of like  a Novocaine almost.  Now, how do you distinguish it from the numbness in Jim's head?  Yeah, because sometimes... 
[00:29:30]  I'm a numbskull.  Yes.  And one more thing I learned from TV.  They say if you drink green tea, that reduces the mercury in your blood.  That's what I saw in Discovery.  You think that's possible?  No, he's got to stop eating thermometers.  Yeah, no kidding.  He eats everything with a thermometer.  That's not how I get them in there.  Oh, literal Jim.  No, I have them pounded up my rump.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  You take it the other way?  I'm a temperature kid.  That's the old-fashioned way, as I like to say.  How the fuck do you have such a high mercury level?  All the sushi. 
[00:30:00]  How many days a week?  At one point, it was a lot.  It's not as much anymore.  I used to be three days a week.  Wow.  I'm way down.  No, I'm not even once a week.  Three days a week is a lot?  That's a lot, yeah.  Once a week is a lot for sushi.  I'm way down, though.  I'm like once a month at this point.  Where's all that mercury come from?  Come on.  It's in the middle of the ocean they catch these fish.  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  I wonder what all this oil is going to fucking do to the fish.  Yeah, I know.  I like shrimp.  And, you know, they sure get a lot of them down there.  I'm not touching shrimp for the next 10 years. 
[00:30:30]  Shrimps.  I like them shrimps.  Fuck that.  Sorry, Louisiana, but I ain't eating no shrimp anytime soon.  Mm-hmm.  Striker.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning, Striker.  Oh, boy, until your acid reflux mimics a heart attack and you think you're going to die.  Mine woke me up one morning and I was, I mean, I thought for sure that that was it.  I was having a heart attack.  My wife actually called the doctor.  He said, call an ambulance.  I vomited just before the ambulance arrived and felt great. 
[00:31:00]  I said, oh, I don't need to go to the hospital.  They're like, you're going anyhow.  I said, because you should still be having a heart attack.  Yeah.  And they said, oh, it was acid reflux.  I wasn't allowed ketchup, tomatoes, onions, coffee, anything acidic for two years.  Two years?  Years?  What the hell?  Two years.  Jesus Christ.  I was on a lot of the anti-acid type medicine as well.  Yeah, I'm a, no, I had the heart attack feeling.  So, it's bad. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, it's fucking bad.  It mimics a heart attack.  It turns around and says, it might look something like this.  See if it does Christopher Walken having a heart attack or Nicholson having a heart attack.  Oh, fuck.  Here's cardiac arrest.  That's one of the things they tell you is, you know, there's a lot of people who will think  they're just having an upset stomach or acid reflux and they could be having a heart attack.  They find them on the floor with a drip of Mylanta coming out of their mouth. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  They thought it was fucking, oh, well.  A little more serious than that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, sir.  Greg in D.C., more on the sushi and the mercury thing.  Greg?  Yeah, there's a restaurant out in Atlantic City.  They're getting a brand new chef and they've got like this low, low mercury.  The chef slices a blowfish so that you can almost guarantee there's no poison.  And it's opening at Borgata July 2nd and 3rd. 
[00:32:30]  Wow.  Very, very helpful.  Wow.  What a good boy.  That's weird because that's when Jim Norton's going to be down there.  I believe the chef's name is Kashi Norton.  Again, Greg.  Wow.  He slipped that one in very cleverly.  I don't know why they're taking chances with the blowfish.  That's crazy to me, man.  I guess you have to have a license to prepare it.  If you prepare it right, it's probably fine.  Yeah.  Take a bone.  You can choke on a bone.  I mean...  You certainly can. 
[00:33:00]  Uh-huh.  I, uh...  I gotta thank James Norton.  For what?  The John Cazale fucking documentary.  Ah, you're very welcome.  You were talking about that yesterday.  I went on HBO On Demand on Files.  And, uh, got it.  And, uh, it's not that long.  It's quick.  40 minutes.  Yeah, 40 minutes.  What is it?  It's all about John Cazale, the fucking, you know, Fredo.  The guy that played Fredo.  He's only in five films.  Which is amazing.  Part of it is the fact that no one knows his fucking name.  But, uh, yeah, only five films. 
[00:33:30]  But five great films he was in.  Both Godfather's Dog Day Afternoon, The Conversation, and The Deer Hunter are his five movies.  Wow.  Five movies.  The Conversation is the only one I haven't seen.  Gene Hackman film is very, very good.  I've heard it's good.  And you do not realize how good this guy was until you see...  Why are only five films?  People, like, point it out.  He died.  Oh.  They had to shoot The Deer Hunter out of sequence so he could be in the movie because he had  lung cancer and they knew he was going to die.  Died before it was released.  So he shot all of his scenes and then died before the film was even done. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  The whole, uh, thing on...  I mean, there was some fucking A-listers in that thing talking about him like he was  the shit.  Pacino, De Niro, uh, Coppola.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl.  Well, that was his fiance.  Yeah, yeah.  Unbelievable, though.  Great documentary if, uh, you want to check it out.  What's it called?  If I...  I thought it was you?  I knew it was you?  I thought it was you.  I knew it was you.  I knew it was you.  It's fucking great, man.  Yeah.  I knew it was you. 
[00:34:30]  You realize how good he was by his eyes?  They concentrate on his eyes?  Oh, my God.  It's like, fuck this guy can act.  There was one scene that they showed from Dog Day Afternoon where he's got the gun and  he's trying to keep an eye on everybody, uh, in the car toward the end of the movie.  Yeah.  And every time he blinked, his eyes moved from side to side and it looked so fucking intense, you know?  Just really good.  And then the scene where he's, uh, in the, in the chair and Michael's talking to him and  he's, and he's like, I'm your older brother.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  I was passed over.  Like, the way he uses the chair and his arms are fucking, like, all swinging all over the  place.  But just, uh, really amazing.  And you, you know something?  I never really noticed.  I just, he did such a good job that you don't notice until someone points it out and you're  like, fuck, that is really good acting.  He sunk into that fucking mopey chair and he has his little mustache.  Just defeated.  Yeah.  His little Godfather 2 mustache.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Trying to be more like Pop.  So sad.  Great, though, if, uh, you want to check that out. 
[00:35:30]  It's on HBO On Demand.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Good one.  Did this, uh, just come out?  I don't know.  I think it's been out for a couple of years.  I think it came out in, like, 2008.  You wish everybody knew who this guy was, though, because he really was a tremendous  fucking talented, uh, he, 40 nominations.  His five movies got a total of 40 Oscar nominations and he never got nominated.  He never really got nominated, no.  Well, look who he was with.  I mean, he was with amazing people.  Yeah, the cast was ridiculous.  And all of them talk about how he made them better.  Oh, Gene Hackman was interviewed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  None of these guys do press.  Nope. 
[00:36:00]  I know.  That's what it was amazing.  It's like, fuck, look at these guys.  How did they get that guy?  And then you see De Niro talk and you're like, oh, yeah, that's why he doesn't, uh, he's  just a very bland guy, you know.  He's just a bore.  He was good.  And I, uh.  He's missed.  He was, uh, very good.  There'd be a good push and pull with him.  Um, he's really a meek guy.  Yeah.  He really is not what he plays in the movies.  Pacino, God love his soul.  Just trying to look young with that leather jacket.  Leather jacket.  And the wig. 
[00:36:30]  It was, the wig.  His hair was so high.  He had it combed up in the front.  I don't understand why he does that.  I have no idea.  It's already a wig.  Why are you making it fucking high on your head?  We'd do a back and forth thing until we were in the zone and then, yeah.  But it makes sense that he's the way, because that would get you into a scene, is you would  just start talking and he goes, it wouldn't feel right.  And he would just go, so what did you do this weekend?  Yeah.  And just start rapping with you about something and then kind of get you to where that mood  should be.  And then he would just start doing lines.  It was great. 
[00:37:00]  And then, yeah, go right into the written part, the scripted part, after just having  casual conversation with you and getting you into the zone or the mood that the scene  needed.  Just fucking really amazing.  Great documentary.  Good one.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You're welcome.  I will definitely check that out myself.  Yeah, congrats on HBO On Demand.  Hey, moving on to stuff that's happening in the world.  What's happening?  You guys saw the Gary Coleman picture by now, right?  Just now.  The death pic?  What the fuck?  Well, let me see Gary Coleman's death picture.  Well, it's, well, he's still alive. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, shit.  This bitch.  Still alive.  Three feet tall and he's still alive.  At this point, he's still alive.  It's, uh, if you go to, uh, glowmagazine.com.  Yeah.  Um, still alive.  His ex-wife slash kind of wife.  I don't know what the fuck, what their relationship was all about.  Leech.  She's lean.  She leans into the picture.  Look at this.  There it is.  Oh my God.  Gary Coleman was murdered.  Now, this is what the Globe did. 
[00:38:00]  Cause everyone's like, who the fuck would print these pictures?  So, supposedly, the Globe bought the pictures off Shannon Price for, I think, $10,000.  That's all she got to sell herself and Gary Coleman out like this.  Look at the way she's leaning in.  She's leaning in, and that has nothing to do with compassion or love or concern.  She is leaning into that picture like, look, it's me in the picture with Gary Coleman with  just fucking massive amounts of tubes and ventilator and all kinds of shit. 
[00:38:30]  And Gary Coleman looks like a preemie baby.  You're right.  He really does.  He's adorable.  I mean, I've seen a preemie baby or two.  A preemie baby.  Same shit with everything hooked up to the poor little fella.  Oh, his head's all wrapped up.  And, uh, what the Globe did, they bought the pictures from her, or a couple of them, I don't  know how many, for about $10,000.  And they just went right for it.  They said, fuck this.  It was murder.  She, they're accusing her of murder.  Well, I don't know if, I don't know if they're officially accusing her of murder, but they're  basically saying that something is not right here. 
[00:39:00]  I've said this from day one.  Yes.  My expertise from watching many of the crime shows.  Hold on.  Can you go back to the original picture you had on there?  Because from day one, you said murder on this.  Yeah.  And we're both right.  Just go to the, uh.  You said it too.  No.  Chambi.  And look at the right, top right corner of the Globe magazine that's coming out.  Al Gore caught up in gay scandal.  Wow.  Now, who told you that one?  Who told you that?  Is the Globe getting their news from this show? 
[00:39:30]  Are we supplying the Globe with their headlines?  As soon as I heard Al Gore was getting divorced after 40 years, I went, something, something  gay is happening there.  Wow.  You're right.  And look at the Globe is going with it.  You know what?  And Anthony's headline, it was murder.  It was murder.  So we're both right today.  Let me decipher that Al Gore caught up in gay scandal, though.  They want it to look like Al Gore is gay.  It's obviously going to be, and I know nothing about this story, that there's some kind  of scandal going on with maybe people he's worked with or something, and there's a gay 
[00:40:00]  connection that is ten times removed.  It's barely a connection?  Yeah, barely a connection.  All right.  But they want you to think Al Gore is getting giant cock in his ass.  All right.  It made me feel good.  A lucky boy.  It made me feel like I was onto something.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I know you're right, by the way.  Because if it was anything else, it wouldn't just be caught up in gay scandal.  It would be, Al Gore is a big homo.  But it was murder.  Gary Coleman, it was murder.  He's complaining about anal warming now. 
[00:40:30]  See, because the friction.  Now, read that paragraph, Anthony, about that Gary Coleman was murdered.  How are they deciding that this is what they think happened?  Murder, Jesus.  It's the story and pictures all America is talking about.  Sitcom legend Gary Coleman was the victim of shocking foul play, a top investigator says,  and that was me, the top investigator, after examining blood splatter evidence found at 
[00:41:00]  the pint-sized actor's Utah home.  Why did they have to say pint-sized?  Because he's pint-sized.  After he was discovered lying on the kitchen floor with a gaping head wound.  Find out why the CSI analyst insists the different stroke star was murdered.  And see the surprising last photos of bandaged Coleman and his ex-wife, Shannon Price, taken in his hospital room just hours before his tragic death. 
[00:41:30]  It's only in Globe.  She's fucking leaning into the picture, man.  She's despicable.  Splatter evidence, are they talking about?  A little blood splatter?  Boy, that's blood splatter evidence.  That'll get you.  That'll get you.  You know how you could tell the type of shit you had from toilet splatter evidence?  That's how blood works.  If it's up your back, there was some foul play going on down there.  Very foul play. 
[00:42:00]  If it's on the bottom of the toilet seat, if it's on the bottom of the toilet seat in a spot it should not be in, there's foul play.  It explains why, I mean, let's go with this a little bit.  I mean, it explains the 911 call where she didn't want to touch him.  She didn't want to touch him.  Because she needed him to die, like, if he survived that, then of course he's going to be talking.  She killed me.  Pung, shut up.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  We have no idea, but there's a lot of suspicious shit going on.  Or it's too much. 
[00:42:30]  Right?  Too much suspicious shit.  And she just loves being on TV.  I know you guys don't watch the Hollywood trash shows, but she's doing interviews for all of them.  Yeah.  We should probably get some of that audio, actually.  They are as bad as she is.  Like, they are all so reprehensible.  They're trying to make believe they're not as bad as she is, but you're absolutely right.  Hi, yes, Gary Coleman's fallen down and he's hurt himself.  Please, can you get me a towel?  Ow!  Yeah, he's really hurt. 
[00:43:00]  Send an ambulance, but not too quick.  Um, Gary, are you okay?  Ow!  Look, I gotta tell the police.  She's trying to...  Yeah, you just shut...  Be quiet down there, Gary.  Now, Keith J. Niagara Falls says the Globe is as credible as a placemat.  No, those magazines have gotten more credible. 
[00:43:30]  People are thinking of the Weekly World News, for the most part, which was Bat Boy and things like that.  These magazines have a good track record, uh, recently.  A lot of these crazy stories start with the Globe and the National Choir, and then they  move to the mainstream media.  Exactly.  Because they pay for news, so people go to them first.  Right.  Yes.  Whereas a lot of the mainstream media won't, like, they don't like to acknowledge that they  pay for news.  Something is just not right with this whole Gary Coleman situation.  Yeah, I agree.  Nope.  Not in a lot.  She's doing a lot of interviews.  She's taking him on tours of the house.  They're showing exactly where he fell, or where he landed after, yeah, whatever. 
[00:44:00]  This was the spot.  She's very unsympathetic as a victim's wife.  You really hate her.  There's no remorse, there's no, not remorse, but there's no sympathy, there's, she doesn't  seem upset in the least about Gary Coleman being dead.  It's her chance to be famous.  Yeah, yeah.  She sucks.  You know what?  She really is a piece of shit.  Why don't we come up with this right away?  Bill and Georgia.  Bill, go ahead.  Hello, Bill.  Hello.  They said Gary fell and cracked his skull. 
[00:44:30]  He only fell two feet.  I mean, the guy wasn't three foot tall.  How can he get enough momentum to crack his noggin?  Yeah, big, big head.  If you're that short, it's really tough to fall over.  Big heavy head.  You ever drop a bowling ball from three feet?  Good point.  Good point.  Let me say hi to Dave.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Good morning, Dave.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, is Gypsy going to be doing the autopsy on Gary Coleman?  Yeah, that's right. 
[00:45:00]  It was the headline.  Yeah.  It was murder.  Murder.  Yeah.  Are you telling me he fell?  He was holding that lantern, Sam.  Standing in front of that house.  And he had his little jockey helmet on.  Jockey.  That would have protected him from any fall unless the girl lifted the little helmet and struck  his little head.  It was a frying pan, I think.  Yeah.  She hit him with a frying pan after he refused to sign a different strokes DVD for Jimmy Norton. 
[00:45:30]  Very happy music.  Those were the hairs of a coconut.  They weren't even his.  She brained him with a coconut, Sam.  That's right.  Todd Bridges' semen was found in her hair.  Oh.  Love triangle.  Yes.  Oh, wow. 
[00:46:00]  That's right.  Gordon clapped at it because Arnold walked in while he was molesting Dudley.  Steve from Bayshore is saying, Kenny stars as Lieutenant Mongoloid.  Steve.  Lieutenant Mongoloid.  Very nice.  The fucking death photos, though.  Holy shit.  They're just speckling.  With her leaning in like that.  That's tasteless.  Yes.  The way she's leaning in is like, that's how you take a picture with a celebrity. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  Like, that's not dying.  Or you make sure you get your face in there because you want a little exposure yourself.  Exactly.  Yep.  She wants to be famous.  Yeah.  She's a failed actress, right?  Or something.  Oh, of course.  I think she tried to make it in Hollywood and failed miserably.  Of course.  Yeah, because if it was just the pictures they got her, Gary Coleman, they would post those  and maybe give her, you know, oh, and she was in the hospital room.  But these, they post them and her face is all over the place.  Right.  Right.  They can't even crop her out.  Right.  Man, she leaned right in, man. 
[00:47:00]  They should have cropped her out, though.  They should have just chopped half her face off.  Yeah.  Well, I think they're going for something there, though.  I think they're trying to save face.  Oh, yeah.  Look how despicable this woman is that she took this photo.  Oh, yeah.  We printed it, by the way.  But look how despicable she is.  I bet there's nothing in there that implies that she murdered him.  But just the fact that he was murdered.  But the way they placed the photo, the way they put it was murder, and the way it says, 
[00:47:30]  I didn't push him, in quotes, really implies that she murdered him.  They saved their ass, though.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't want to be sued.  It's very smart.  You look at that magazine cover and think, oh, she killed him.  Right.  But they probably did cover their ass.  Yep.  Yep-a-rooney.  All right.  We have a busy show, huh?  Bill Burr in today?  Nice.  I love when the Bill Burr comes in.  The Jim Jefferies will also be here.  The Jim Jefferies is good.  I wonder what...  Could we take some bets on what condition he'll be in? 
[00:48:00]  Let's think.  It's Thursday.  Will he be hungover as a fuck or still drunk?  I got the answer, actually.  Oh, you do?  He tweeted right before, around 5.30.  Oh.  Says, going on O&A in a couple of hours, I've had no sleep, but I'm very sober.  Hmm.  Why was he up?  That means he's very fucking drunk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If he had to say, I'm sober... 
[00:48:30]  That means he's very drunk.  We're going to get a drunk Jim Jeffery.  Yeah, well, it was pretty fun when he was drunk last time.  Yep.  And then we got Victoria Zadrach coming in.  Oh, she has it in?  Where's that tomorrow?  Oh, that's tomorrow.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  And also today, the Iron Sheik.  That's today?  That's today as well.  Oh, my God.  Piss your pants, Iron Sheik.  The Iron Sheik will be coming in.  And will he be drunk?  I think he might be.  Yeah, he should be.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  He'll be drunk.  Yeah.  And Willie, Willie, you think he'll talk about fucking Hulk Hogan in his ass to show him  that he is a real man and Hulk Hogan is a faggot.  He absolutely will be doing that, but he's expanded his repertoire.  Oh, he has.  Now he's saying how he's going to fuck the CEO of BP in the ass.  Oh, wow.  He's current now.  He's topical.  That's good.  He's topical and current.  Topical ass rapist.  Yeah.  So now he's talking about people in the news and how he's going to fuck them in the ass.  And then he finishes up with a piss your pants and a thank you good night. 
[00:49:30]  He gets the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  He ain't hurting nobody.  My cook.  My giant cook.  Giant?  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That guy's got some kind of language he likes to use, right?  It's like, don't bring him around in the family anytime soon.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  Boy, did Chip bomb at the sushi restaurant? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, no.  He bombed.  Would you leave that poor girl alone?  It was time for the check.  And the waiter came over and said, you know, anything else?  And Chip just had to pipe up, like, no, if I eat this sushi, I'm going to blow up something.  And my girlfriend actually covered her fucking face with her hands.  Of course.  Why wouldn't she?  Because the guy wanted to laugh.  She, like, leaned in.  Because Chip was like, I eat so much sushi if I eat any more. 
[00:50:30]  And the guy, like, leaned into here.  Here comes the gag.  He thought it would be funny.  Yeah.  Because he was actually the Mexican busboy.  And then Chip said, I might blow up or something.  And he just was like, ah.  And just backed away uncomfortably.  It was really one of Chip's worst bombs.  I don't know how you can put yourself in such an uncomfortable position many times.  Oh, Chip did.  Nothing to do with me.  Had nothing to do with me.  Chip doing snaps.  Dancing to Chip Hop.  That has nothing to do with Chip Hop.  Nothing to do with me. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  We'll take a break.  Get into some other things.  Oh, John Sterling was interviewed about his home run calls.  It's just as douchey as listening to his home run calls.  I hope the guy interviewing, I hope there was a hammer and some apologies involved.  He's 72.  Do you know how old he is?  I didn't.  What?  I think he's 71 years old.  Could you Google it?  Wikipedia.  Also, Bobo leaves a very emotional apology for Jim Norton on the FU line.  We got that. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know what that's about.  Jimmy was telling me something happened.  You'll explain after the break, Jimmy?  I will, yes.  Okay.  61.  Oh, 61.  Someone gave it to me wrong.  And an old woman calls Google customer help because she can't close Google Pac-Man.  I've heard this.  Holy shit.  It's great, right?  What a dummy.  All right.  Lots to do after the break.  Congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks.  It was a real good game last night, but the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup, Anthony, and 
[00:52:00]  that's it for hockey, finally.  Hockey is finally over.  A lot of people with bated breath there when the goal was made and the light didn't go on.  Yep.  And the official didn't call it a goal, but then they realized, yeah, it's a goal.  And that was an overtime 4-3, first cup for the Chicago Blackhawks in 49 years.  Wow.  Since 19, what would that be, 61, I guess?  Now, that didn't merit a Chicago riot because, as we know, hockey is not a sport big with people 
[00:52:30]  that would normally riot or perform some type of shenanigans, as I like to say.  Basically, blacks don't like hockey.  I wasn't saying blacks.  I'm saying people that are hockey fans aren't usually the ones that will riot as much as,  let's say, basketball or football fans.  In this case, you would be correct.  Yes.  I'm a season ticket holder. 
[00:53:00]  I don't see black people at hockey games.  Well, I wasn't talking about black people.  I wasn't talking about black people.  I know.  I'm just talking about, you know, people that would normally go to a hockey game, don't  seem like the type that would riot, is all I'm saying.  Oh.  See, it could be anybody, is what I'm saying.  You're making sure we don't get fired.  I got it.  Yes.  So the fucking hockey season is finally over. 
[00:53:30]  And people are saying sports curse.  I'm like, no, man.  I told you exactly what was going to happen.  But I said, the Blackhawks are the better team.  The Blackhawks will win the Stanley Cup.  But I have to root for the Flyers because they've got a lot of family and friends down  there in Philly.  That's exactly what I said at the beginning of this series.  Well, the Flyers also, coming back from Boston like that, from being three down to Boston,  it looked like they were destined to win.  So even though the Blackhawks are the better team, I think it looked like, oh, well, these 
[00:54:00]  guys got the momentum.  Yeah.  You know.  But it doesn't work that way.  Played them tough.  But that don't mean shit.  Shut it in.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  About what?  I don't know.  I'm just, I got to shut it.  The black thing?  Kevin from Connecticut said shut it.  The black thing?  I just think he doesn't like my take on the...  Hockey?  On hockey, yeah.  But Kevin from Connecticut, who was he rooting for?  Yeah, the Hartford Whalers, fucko. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, shit.  That's going to hurt.  Ain't got no team.  Ain't got no team.  Ain't got no team.  See, Anthony, your theory is all wrong, though.  Matt in Wisconsin.  Go ahead, Matt.  Matt.  Set in straight.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Hello.  Yeah.  I've watched some video on the Canadians, and they do do some rioting after they win  the same cup.  Canadians.  I'm talking about American people.  Talking about real people.  Americans.  And we are white. 
[00:55:00]  We are white.  It doesn't matter.  There's some kind of an ingrained hockey fucking fanaticism in Canada.  You are very right, Anthony.  The Cananidadians.  So, really get into their hockey.  So, and, you know, they go crazy.  So, no riots in Chicago?  No.  We know that for sure.  And we know in Chicago, sometimes those people riot over anything.  Yes.  They love turning over a cop car.  I mean, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  And if, yeah, they do that, and they are crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm just saying, Americans are real people, not like Canadians and people from, like, Europe  and stuff.  But they're kind of like second-class citizens.  Did you see Roenick?  There we go.  Yeah.  Would you just agree to agree?  Yeah, I know, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you, Matt.  Did you see Roenick crying last night?  No.  One of the commentators?  Because he never won the Stanley Cup.  Really?  21 years in the league.  Never won the Stanley Cup.  I think he went to the finals once. 
[00:56:00]  So, what town did he come from, and did he have two bad knees?  Well, that's what a lot of people are saying on the Twitter today, Anthony.  The Twitter?  On the Twitter.  We have sort of a Mike Schmidt situation.  But I watched it before the show.  It's more of a visual, unfortunately.  But Roenick starts losing it.  And during the game, they're talking about the Stanley Cup being in the house.  And Roenick goes, I've never touched it.  Because he goes, I've seen it from a distance or whatever, but I've never touched it.  Because I always told myself I would never touch the Stanley Cup until I won it. 
[00:56:30]  And unfortunately for me, I never got to do that because I didn't win the Stanley Cup.  So, at the end of the game, they're kind of doing their little wrap-up.  And all of a sudden, this big, huge win for the Chicago Blackhawks, having won this thing in 49 years,  it becomes all about Roenick crying on TV.  What an ass.  And then Mike Milbury, who just wants to fucking punch somebody, he's just a grumpy old fuck.  He actually almost was hugging him and going, that's okay.  You had a great career.  Trying to calm him down? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Can we find a good copy of that, Danny, for these guys?  Yeah, you got to see this.  What an ass.  Oh, is this it?  Here's Roenick.  All right, let's listen.  Well, Chicago Blackhawks, congratulations to the fans.  You guys deserve it.  The Chicago Blackhawks deserve it.  I've been there.  I know what it's like.  This is an emotional thing for me.  Both these teams were warriors.  They went out and they did great things for the National Hockey League.  Chicago really enjoyed this one.  For the kid that was there in 1992 who was crying when I came off the ice after we lost 
[00:57:30]  game four in Chicago Stadium.  You waited 18 years.  I hope you have a big smile on your face.  I can tell.  Congratulations.  You're emotional.  Absolutely.  Why is it affecting you?  Chicago Blackhawks.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  The lips go back slightly.  This motherfucker next to him saw it.  He saw blood.  That's Dan Patrick.  And he went for it.  Oh, yeah.  Because he was pretty much done.  It was classic.  With this emotional moment. 
[00:58:00]  He just wanted to say how he felt and then move on to something else.  The guy next to him there, what's his name?  Dan Patrick.  Dan Patrick is like, you're emotional.  Why don't you tell him what's making you emotional?  And he pats him on the back like, cry, bitch.  Do you see his lip quiver, too?  Watch the lip.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, we've never done this before, eh?  Oh, this is, I know.  We smell blood sometimes.  We've seen this tactic done.  We smell the blood.  You've got to go for it.  Oh, this guy wants it.  Let's see Dan Patrick on the left and Mike Milbury on the right there.  A little shaky lip. 
[00:58:30]  Absolutely.  Why is it affecting you?  Chicago Blackhawks, man.  I didn't get to do that.  Well, I didn't get to do it either, and I'm not going to cry, but you better go, kid.  You had a hell of a career anyway.  You know, you see some guys down there that you never know.  I'm proud.  You never know when you're going to get a chance.  I'm proud.  I'm happy.  For 21 years, you were in a Stanley Cup final once.  One time.  A guy that blocked shots with his nose. 
[00:59:00]  And, you know, in my first two seasons out of 13, we went to the Stanley Cup final and lost it and never got a chance to get it again.  So, I would say, that's how rare a bird this trophy is.  Well, as he said, I waited all my career to touch it.  These guys get that opportunity, and you only hold it after you've won it.  I can't see this enough, Dan.  Rubbing it in.  April 16th, 1961.  The Blackhawks win in Detroit.  I think that's it.  Yeah.  All right.  What a fuck.  See, it's more of a visual.  Roenick is just completely losing it.  He really is losing it.  And, actually, Mike Milbury had to be that guy. 
[00:59:30]  Like, it's okay.  Mike Milbury doesn't want to do that.  And he wants to take his shoe off and beat him across the face with it.  Hey, I didn't win it.  I'm not crying.  I like that.  That's hysterical.  Hey, baby.  Shut the fuck up.  We all got our crosses to bear.  Deal with it.  A real man steps in and tells him to knock it off.  Dry your eyes.  Wait, are you going to squirt?  A little fucking snot coming out of your nose, you fucking faggot.  I was hoping for a Bruce Kelly cry, but we didn't get to that point. 
[01:00:00]  Absolutely crying over here.  He, at the last minute, kept it together.  Oh, I was down by the photogs.  The photogs.  Shut up.  There is he.  Hey, leave Bruce Kelly.  What car dealership is he fucking hawking Chevys at?  Are you saying, old radio guys, that's all they get to do after their careers are over?  It seems that way.  Yeah, you're kind of right.  I've looked at the track records.  Yeah, you're kind of right.  It doesn't look good.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Ugh.  So.  What's Bruce Kelly doing now? 
[01:00:30]  Is there, is there, is that his Wikipedia page?  Does it say what he's doing now?  Sort of.  Sort of.  As long as he's still here at the same place that it says here on January.  Yeah, as of January 4th, 2010, Radio Fargo Moorhead announced Kelly as the new morning  personality for classic hits KMJO Mojo 104.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  Go to the website.  Let's see if he's there.  Wait, he's in Fargo?  Fargo.  Ugh.  I feel so bad for my fellow radio guys.  Oh, he's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's too old to have to travel around the country.  To Fargo, especially.  Oh, my God.  Radio Fargo.  I'm absolutely freezing over here.  Jesus.  Poor fuck.  Fargo.  When you're young in this business, whatever, you travel around, it doesn't matter. 
[01:01:30]  You know?  Yeah.  You get a little older.  You get sad for these guys that have to continue doing this.  He's doing an appearance at fucking the car dealership.  Uh-oh.  This tan Sierra could be yours.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  Well, Danny Mojo in the morning with Kelly and Kelly.  Okay.  So, he's part of the Kelly and Kelly.  Kelly and Kelly.  But they don't really show his picture.  They show the hot brood.  Yeah.  That's all I'm seeing.  I'm not seeing his picture anywhere. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, Mojo Radio.  Didn't Scott Shannon come up with Mojo Radio?  Probably.  I think he did.  I think he invented it.  I think Rockface did.  How come it says Mojo in the morning with Ryan Kelly, but where's the other Kelly?  Maybe.  There's no.  Maybe he's not there anymore?  Picture of him?  Oh, boy.  Where's that?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no.  Well, uh.  Oh, that's a shame.  Well, it's a lie.  Let's hear if they're on right now. 
[01:02:30]  Oh.  Listen live.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Listen live.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Let's listen live.  Listen live.  I bet they'll be in commercial because it's regular radio.  We're playing a Lady Gaga song.  Do you play Lady Gaga on a Mojo station?  All right.  Mojo.  You see what Lady Gaga did to her kid sister?  Kid sister's graduating from high school. 
[01:03:00]  Is she hot?  Upper East Side.  She looks all right, actually.  She's on the front page of the paper.  Yeah.  And Lady Gaga had to show up at her kid sister's graduation in a bee fucking, a beekeeper outfit.  Oh, yeah.  That's, you know, she kind of looks like Lady Gaga.  Taking all the attention away from her kid sister and everybody else that graduated up there.  I think she performed there, too.  Didn't she?  Because she was an outcast at that school, apparently.  Oh, really?  So she performed for the high school graduates?  Yeah.  I'm sure her sister loved it, though.  When you're fucking, when your sister is the biggest star in the country at one point, 
[01:03:30]  it is kind of cool.  Like, fuck the whole class.  Skinny little ass her sister's again.  Lady Gaga is becoming the biggest star in the world, quickly.  Can we listen live?  Is there a way?  This is supposed to be playing right now.  Oh, it's supposed to be playing?  Yeah, that internet radio crap doesn't work.  It really doesn't.  No.  I was trying to check out a few stations recently, and it's just, it's, it's horseshit. 
[01:04:00]  Half the time, you can't get it to work on your computer.  The fuck?  I don't know what's going on.  Cacksacker.  This is how they're competing with satellite radio.  And look, we can't, we can't give them a nice plug.  We can't get it on.  On your mobile device, it says.  No, you can't.  I know.  No, you can't.  It says playing.  All right, listen, we're in a sports, uh.  We didn't play?  Huh?  It says playing.  If you get it, let us know.  John Sterling.  You guys, you guys didn't play the douchey, uh, Grand Slam call? 
[01:04:30]  Why not?  No, we didn't play it yesterday, yeah.  Fucking busy yesterday, man.  But that's your bit.  You guys love hearing those things.  Yeah.  I was thinking about Rampage coming in.  I didn't care about fucking that old fat hack.  Well, you guys, you guys talked about it yesterday, but you didn't play it.  I got it.  Yeah, yeah.  I got it.  So let's play it real fast, because then it leads to the John Sterling interview.  Ah.  Which has to be fascinating.  Sorry to spoon feed this every time, but John Sterling is the, uh, radio, uh, announcer  for the Yankees.  Mm-hmm.  Does a pretty damn good job, um, quite frankly. 
[01:05:00]  But.  But.  It's a big but.  When someone hits a fucking homer, even the home run call is really good until the end  when he has to come up with silly, stupid names for the people hitting the home runs.  Yeah, he's got to tie in the player's name in some wacky way with the fucking home run,  and it's just awful.  I think it's crap, but for some reason, no one calls him out on it.  But here's Granderson, uh, hitting a grand slam.  Yeah, and this, uh, just, I, I've been waiting for this to happen just to hear how douchey  he'd be. 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  Right when the Yankees signed Granderson, I'm just thinking, oh, fuck, if he hits a grand  slam, Sterling's just gonna fucking lose his shit.  Yep.  And this is how it went down.  With two out, the 2-2.  Swung on, there it goes.  Deep right field, it is high.  Middles far, there it is, gone.  It's a grand slam.  It's a Granderson slam.  The Grandy Man can.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  Curtis Granderson drills a grand slam over the high scoreboard wall. 
[01:06:00]  The biggest problem I have with it, it is, it's, it's so obviously forced.  Yes.  Did you hear the way he said it?  It's like, it's a grand slam.  Hey.  Get ready, people.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Granderson slam.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That was really bad.  And then, oh, the Grandy Man can.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  It's been really bad, man. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  So, I don't know.  One of the local news stations decided to interview John Sterling on his home run calls and how  he comes up with them and all that.  I bet it's a fascinating story.  People need to know, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is very important.  It starts off with how John created his call.  That's exactly what I want to hear, too.  Mm-hmm.  That's interesting.  Oh, very good.  Fascinating.  I can't believe you just said, really?  Ha!  This is how it should be in the booth. 
[01:07:00]  Silence.  Let it be known the CD is playing.  Oh, it is?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Maybe the...  Maybe the what?  Maybe the Mojo Radio was playing, too.  Sex Bagel.  Nothing's happening.  Is it Sex Bagel?  Sex Bagel.  Did Sex Bagel burn the data to the disc?  Because he has the track record of the one that makes the most fuck-ups when it comes 
[01:07:30]  to burning discs or burning calories.  Here he comes.  If someone works out a lot, he certainly doesn't run when he needs to.  No.  Wouldn't you run down that hall?  Because now we're just stuck here live in the air with nothing to play.  He's waving his arms.  He's all...  That is the most uncomfortable thing, having to walk down that long hall with everyone  watching you through the glass.  I just mentioned yesterday, he's always out of breath for some reason.  Like, all the time.  Why wouldn't you run?  About...  At least run up to the mic.  Brag about a trainer and getting in shape. 
[01:08:00]  Run down the fucking hall, man.  Yeah.  Get a sprint in.  Nah, that's all right.  That's going to be...  Yeah, fuck it.  What happened?  It worked fine in the office.  We tested it and everything.  Oh, yeah?  Well, I'm testing it here and it's not working.  We're testing it on the air.  Yeah, really.  Our tests have shown it's not working.  Yes.  And these tests matter more.  Yeah.  I hope you got a big laugh in the office.  Yeah.  You can't say it worked fine in the office as I played it twice on the air and it's dead 
[01:08:30]  air.  Look, here's a third time just to prove it.  Plus, it says 20 seconds instead of 57.  Oh, boy.  So there's something going on.  I'll burn another copy.  Oh, he rock.  Look, he's all like, all right, I guess I'll burn another copy.  Call us when you get down the hall.  Want to make sure you got there all right.  On such a long trip.  There he goes.  Timing's everything on that.  Nah, we'll get to it at some point.  Why don't we do the old woman then, Ant? 
[01:09:00]  And then we'll go back to John Sterling.  You old bag.  I was reading about this.  I was tipped off to it by a, I guess, an email from Trap Dog.  And I listened to it because I love this technology and how old people suck at it.  And it's a good one of those calls to customer service.  Sure.  Tech support.  Sure.  About a woman.  Sure.  And she cannot seem to figure out how to get Pac-Man to stop playing on her computer. 
[01:09:30]  She cannot get it to stop.  The Google Pac-Man thing, right?  Right.  That was the whole thing.  It's like the Google, a few, about a week ago or more, I'm not sure, did some kind of an  anniversary of Pac-Man thing where when you went to their homepage, it was in the shape  of Google, but it was the Pac-Man track and you were able to actually play it.  Right.  It was like a little flash game.  You could play it. 
[01:10:00]  It was clever.  And there was music to it.  The original Pac-Man music.  And this woman is beside herself.  She doesn't know how the hell to stop this goddamn music.  She doesn't know how to stop the music.  From the Google.  From the Google.  She's freaking out.  Did anyone actually play it?  Yeah.  Oh, you did play it there?  There was an article that came out.  It said that the day that this was on the front page of Google, it cost businesses something  like $122 million.  Why?  Just from lost man hours.  Man hours.  No kidding.  Just lost paid man hours of people playing Pac-Man on Google. 
[01:10:30]  If you clear that board, what happened?  There's another one.  Oh, so it just keeps going.  It keeps going, yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah, it just kept going.  But it does make the sounds, the music.  And this woman is just a blithering idiot.  I was reading the comments after the story, and a lot of people were bitching at the customer  service guy, the tech support guy.  Why?  That he was snickering in the background.  That he was using terms that were too technical for her, like tabs. 
[01:11:00]  The woman should not be at a computer if she doesn't know what a tab is.  Oh fuck, I gotta hear this.  It's Lorraine.  Lorraine tells Builder Support she can't close Google Pac-Man.  Hi, is Lorraine there?  I'm gonna marry you, Lorraine!  One day you'll be my girl!  Lorraine.  I'm gonna rape you in the back of a car, Lorraine!  Hi, is Lorraine there? 
[01:11:30]  Hey, Jane.  Hi, this is Brian with Builder Support.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, I have a message to give you a call.  Yes, I have, um, I was just in stealth, you know, something.  Something, um, I have the Pac-Man, um, game, and I want to disable that on my homepage.  And I'll go away tomorrow.  It'll go away tomorrow?  Yeah, that's, it actually says Google on the Pac-Man game, that's just because that's what 
[01:12:00]  Google put there.  Okay.  But how do I get rid of it?  It'll go away tomorrow.  Put a gun in your mouth.  So I can't study today?  No, you can go to wherever you want.  You can't study?  So I can't study today?  What is she doing?  No, Lorraine, you can't study.  Google's playing Pac-Man.  The fuck?  What a dunce.  She really is stupid.  Love it.  She, she can't study.  And how does it, what's the tech support guy supposed to not laugh at this? 
[01:12:30]  You have to laugh.  Of course.  You gotta keep your sense of humor no matter what, right?  Keep up your good nature.  No, you, you can go to wherever you want.  Where, where are you wanting to go?  I know I can go wherever I want, but the, the noise from the game is drowning out my Jeff  Paul video.  Um, you can, you can close that.  You don't, you don't need to leave it open. 
[01:13:00]  I could close the Pac-Man thing?  No, you can close your window.  Once you've got your Jeff Paul open, you can close that.  Oh, I could try that.  Um, are you in a hurry?  Do you want to stay with me or?  Oh no, yeah, I can stay with you.  Of course this guy's staying.  He wants to stay.  He's like, yeah, I'll stay with you.  I'll keep the tape rolling.  I'm going to stay with you the whole time, dummy.  Danny cleared the, Danny just cleared the first board. 
[01:13:30]  First two, bitch.  Oh, fuck, man.  Damn, motherfucker.  Damn.  Uh, Lorraine doesn't even really know what web browser she's, uh, using.  Of course she doesn't.  So right now you can hear the, hear the game going?  Um, I, if I turn my monitor on.  The monitor on.  Yeah, I have my monitor.  See, my monitor is turned on.  Stupid Lorraine.  I can hear that.  I'm on the, uh, Jeff Paul web dashboard right now. 
[01:14:00]  Dashboard.  Uh, can you see the Pac-Man game?  Do I see the Pac-Man game?  No.  Oh, um, no, I don't.  I'd have to go back to my home page.  No.  Um, it's most likely there's a tab at the, at the top that's open.  Uh, let's see.  You're using Firefox, right?  I would assume.  Um, so do you see anywhere on the page where it says Google? 
[01:14:30]  I'd have to go back to the home page.  Can I do that?  No, it defeats the purpose, you dumb shit.  If you go back to your home page of Google, then you're off of the page you want to be on.  Unless you click the tab.  Holy mother of fuck, what a dunce.  God, how does the guy just not go, hey, dummy, listen to me.  Wow.  Wow.  I'd make a horrible customer service person.  Well, she tries to close a tab, right? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Well, I, uh, just looking at right now on the page near the top of the screen, do you see it saying Google anywhere?  Um, yes, I have two tabs.  That's what?  Click on the tab that says Google.  Or do, do, do two tabs say Google?  Two tabs say Google.  She opened up two browsers.  And you also have another tab for the library, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So I want you to click on the tab that says Google.  Okay, I got it.  And then there should be a little red X off to the right of it. 
[01:15:30]  Just click on that little red X and it'll actually close Google and it'll close the Pac-Man game.  Um, red X.  To the right of it.  You see where it says Google, right?  Yes.  It's on that page.  Is it on the game itself?  No, no, no, it's on the little bar that says Google.  Oh, click on that X.  There's a little X there.  That will close the Pac-Man game.  And they'll close Google so the Pac-Man game won't be running. 
[01:16:00]  And if you have two of those Google windows open or tabs, you will just need to close the other one as well.  I just did that.  And that's...  Now it's Jeff Paul.  Now what?  What did she say, Dan?  Jeff Paul, I guess, is the website she's trying to get to.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alt.  Tell her alt F4.  Or send her to meat spin.  Yeah, you're going to want to type in meat spin.  Dot com or lemon party. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  And it ends with this.  And so now you don't hear the sound, right?  Right.  Oh, wait.  Let me turn my...  Let me see if I can get my sound back up.  Yep.  I'm up to 15, 18, 20.  Yeah.  My sound's just fine.  Yeah.  So that's all you have to do is make sure Google's closed and you won't be hearing the sound.  Okay.  And it goes away tomorrow?  Yeah.  Pac-Man won't be there anymore tomorrow.  Okay. 
[01:17:00]  How many calls did you get on?  This is actually the first one we've got.  Perfect.  Okay.  It just goes to show I don't know anybody else that knows computers, you know, that I can call.  That's fine.  Anyone else that knows computers?  You don't know.  Okay.  Good.  And any other questions right now?  As far as I know, I'm good to go.  Yeah.  Thank you for contacting Builder Support and have a good day.  Oh, my God.  The Pac-Man.  The Pac-Man.  I can't get the Pac-Man to stop. 
[01:17:30]  The Pac-Man.  Holy shit.  Lorraine's an idiot.  Poor Lorraine.  Lorraine.  She couldn't study.  I can't.  So I go back to my homepage?  No.  If you go back to your homepage, you're going to get off of your other page.  Then you're just going to open it again and waka waka waka waka.  What an asshole.  Oh, that's a good one, but my favorite still is we're going to turn this thing around. 
[01:18:00]  Turn this thing around.  Keep your chin up.  Going to turn this around.  Wow.  She did not understand a lot of what's going on on her screen there.  Traves, play that into break if you can, if you find it good.  All right.  Trav Dog.  The John Sterling interview.  So Iraq walked another copy into the studio for us, which was very nice of him.  Please don't work.  Please don't work.  Please don't work.  Oh, that's going to work, I think. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So John Sterling.  Hi, John.  Talks to a local TV station about how he creates his very famous home run calls.  Genius.  For 162 games a year, plus the entire postseason, and of course spring training, this right here  behind the microphone is John Sterling's home away from home.  Yankees win.  Yankees win.  John Sterling's signature call.  Imitated by so many, but perfected only. 
[01:19:00]  Who's imitating this?  I hate that it's a signature.  We don't need a signature call.  It's not about you.  No.  He's just ass-kissing him like this.  God.  Oh, imitated by many, but only many.  Who imitates him?  No one.  We do.  But we're goofing on him.  Yeah, we're mocking him.  So many, but perfected only by the man himself.  So how'd he come up with it?  When I got to the Yankees, the Yankees were awful in 89, 90, and 91.  So I guess I'd shout Yankees win at the end of one of their few victories. 
[01:19:30]  And then, for some reason while doing it, I said Yankees win.  And to put rhythm in it, I put the Yankees win.  And one day, I don't know why and I don't know when, I put a little rock and roll into  the the.  So it was Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  And then I started to hear it come back.  And then you knew you had something.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:20:00]  Is he taking himself a bit too seriously?  Yeah.  That's not rock and roll.  No.  Oh, come on.  Yankees win!  It's not rock and roll.  Rock and.  Shit your pants.  That's rock and roll.  You know what?  Shitting your pants is rock and roll.  Miss the call because there's a fucking groupie overdosing while she sucks your dick.  That's rock and roll, fella.  You're right.  Ugh.  Then the second part of the story. 
[01:20:30]  And his favorite, the Yankees win calls are always when the Yankees, well, win it all.  And since taking over in the Yankee broadcast booth in 1989, John has not missed a game.  I repeat, he's not missed a single game.  And considering how long these games are today, and how many games the Yankees play, if you  include the postseason, and of course the travel, that's as John would say, amazing. 
[01:21:00]  I really love what I do.  So I actually look forward to doing the games.  Yankees win!  Duh!  Yankees win!  Well, you know what they say.  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.  For My9 News, I'm Duke Estiglione.  Oh, you do that somehow.  I love that.  I love, I absolutely love that story.  I always want to know what it is.  Now, here's Audrey. 
[01:21:30]  They didn't touch the fucking, why do you make it about yourself on home run calls.  Yeah, I know.  They should have.  It was a fluff piece.  I thought they did.  Yeah.  They should have pulled the 60 minutes on him.  Really get him, get him sweating.  Get him sweating in the hot seat.  Really humiliate him.  Martin Short.  Yes.  I love that one.  That's a great fucking.  God, he's.  That's a great fucking bit.  Awful.  Yep.  All right.  So what happened at Caroline's, Jimmy?  Because Bobo left an emotional apology for you. 
[01:22:00]  Bobo asked for.  On the FU line.  We said we'd get him a ticket.  And a couple tickets, whatever.  For Caroline's.  Yeah, he doesn't know any better.  So he comes to the hardest show to get tickets for, the Saturday 8 o'clock show.  Not the Thursday.  Or the Friday late show.  God.  Or the Friday late show.  So we get a call from Kenny who works.  At the club.  To club Saturday, Kenny.  And he goes, we got a guy here named Daniel Kurland.  He said there's five tickets waiting for him. 
[01:22:30]  And Kenny's like, ugh.  I'll handle it when we get there.  We were like two minutes out.  Kenny was annoyed.  Five tickets.  Yes.  So.  I don't think I've ever asked for five tickets.  I wouldn't mind it.  But we said to Kenny at the club, like, can you get him in?  He goes, we can squeeze him in.  And I'm like, because I don't want Caroline's to lose any ticket sales.  But I'm like, look, he's kind of retarded.  So he didn't know any better.  Did you really say that?  Yeah.  He didn't know any better.  That's great.  So I was okay with it.  He came in with his friends.  So I'm on stage.  And stage right, I didn't, I hear this guy in this Mets jersey. 
[01:23:00]  I forget what he said while I was on.  I was in my opening joke, literally.  And he pipes up and he says something.  You know, just trying to chime in.  So I tell him to shut up.  Because again, I know he's one of these idiots who's going to fuck my timing up badly.  Because he doesn't know what he's doing.  And then as I scold him, not even that harshly because it was early on the show.  Sometimes you shut somebody up immediately.  They stop.  His friend stands up and points up and goes, he's a douchebag. 
[01:23:30]  Like, now they're part of the show.  Oh, funny.  And throughout the whole show, the guy was piping up.  And they were being a little annoying and loud.  And I had other people tell me, oh, yeah, it was something he yelled about the Belmont Stakes.  Right.  Whatever it was.  And he wouldn't shut up.  And I really wanted to throw fucking boiling water on these people.  Because again, it wasn't nasty heckling.  They were having fun.  And then I shut him up and he was having fun.  So I'm not going to get somebody thrown for one thing. 
[01:24:00]  It's fine.  But then the whole show, they were just annoying me periodically.  And then afterwards, I'm signing.  And I'm never rude to people when I sign.  And I see this guy in this Mets jersey coming up to me.  And I'm just like fucking so irritated.  It's like, no.  No.  No.  Yeah.  He was trying to not be.  He fucking annoyed me the whole show.  He was going to be a buddy now.  No.  Again, if a guy says one thing and we shut him up, fine.  I get it.  But he was one of those annoying guys.  And then I saw Bobo was with me. 
[01:24:30]  This is my friend.  I'm like, you were here on fucking comp tickets?  And you fucking yapped?  Oh, was I fucking, that put me through the, I'm like, we gave you a fucking free tickets  to this show on the eight o'clock Saturday show.  You motherfucker.  Get out.  And I was at the lie.  I wouldn't talk to him.  Did Kenny, did Kenny, uh.  Kenny had scored them all out.  Including Bobo?  Yeah.  I don't want to.  Probably not very gently either.  Well, he just goes, get out.  Get your friends and get out.  But I wasn't. 
[01:25:00]  My issue wasn't with Daniel because, again, you bring people sometimes that don't know  how to act.  And I knew it wasn't his.  So I wasn't annoyed at Bobo.  I was annoyed that, like, these guys, and again, they weren't being hateful.  I'm not saying they were trying to ruin the show.  But it's like, you lack of respect motherfucker.  Yeah, there's a way to fucking act.  You didn't get those tickets from a fucking radio station promo.  You got them from me, the guy who's working.  Yeah.  Through Bobo.  You got them directly from us.  And you got pretty good seats, stage right. 
[01:25:30]  And you're just going to yap.  And it's such a fun.  I've never would have done that at any show.  Much less show I was given comp tickets to by the fucking performer.  Oh, my God.  Really fucking.  That one really annoyed me.  That's bad.  But I wasn't annoyed at Bobo.  Again, he's a good guy.  He sent me an email and a Facebook.  He Facebooked me.  He can't apologize enough.  I got the voicemail, too. 
[01:26:00]  Let's see if I got the Facebook, too.  Okay.  It was...  Bobo's ass from Cherry Darts.  Yeah, there.  I mean, that's...  His ball bag hanging down.  Jesus.  Covered in whipped cream.  Fuck.  Okay, here it is.  Oh, my God.  Why would...  Why...  Oh, here it is.  Okay, hold on.  It's from his...  Dear Jim Norton.  I would like to say that I am deeply sorry for what happened at your show on 6-5-10. 
[01:26:30]  He's got to put the date like he wouldn't remember.  As opposed to what other shows?  Are you also apologizing for the drink the lady spilled at the Friday early show?  I know which one you mean, Daniel.  I did not con...  He meant to write no, but he mixed up the N and O.  I did not con...  My friend would act the way he did.  I am very pissed off at him.  I got so angry at him that night.  So angry.  I got so angry at him that night. 
[01:27:00]  So angry that when his brother over...  Overed me.  Apparently his brother overed him a ride home.  Overed him.  I told him no.  I took this subway home.  I guess that was I'll show you.  I'll walk.  Yeah, yeah.  You, O.P. and Anthony, mean so much to me.  Oh, God.  Please understand that what happened Saturday...  And he spelled Saturday.  S-A-T-E-R-D-A-Y.  That's how it sounds.  Yeah.  Won't happened...  Put a D.  Happened.  A-G-E-A-N. 
[01:27:30]  A-G-E-A-N.  From now...  It's like a long run on sentence.  Please understand that what happened Saturday...  Won't happen to G-E-A-N from now on...  Anytime you see me on the radio...  I don't see you on the radio.  I hear you.  Or with one of your gigs...  I will be on my...  Self in order to make sure...  S-H-O-R-E.  This does not happen.  A-G-E-A-N.  The O.P. and Anthony show means so much to me.  I wish commas meant something to him or semicolons.  A-G-E-A-N.  Please P-L-E-A-S, which is the plural of to plea.  Let me on the show. 
[01:28:00]  Sincerely, your friend Daniel Bobo Curlin.  So I answered him.  Well, don't tell...  I don't want to know what you said yet because we have the voicemail now.  I said die.  Okay, good.  All right.  Well, then we do need to know.  He left this on the FU line about the incident.  Yeah.  I'd like to give an apology to you, Jim Norton.  I am very sorry about how my friends acted at your show, right?  Especially Jonathan.  He really acted off... 
[01:28:30]  Did not know how to behave himself.  I did not know he was going to act like this.  I can't have no idea how to...  Opie and Anthony mean so much to me.  I love the show so much.  Such that he doesn't want to be on the show because of how my friends acted.  I did not know he was going to act like that.  He apparently does not know how to hold his liquor.  I would like to give a dear apology. 
[01:29:00]  I am dearly sorry for bringing them.  I will never take them again, all right?  I am not even friends with him anymore after how he acted.  So, too.  Jonathan, fuck you.  I want to give a dear apology and an elk apology.  This is a pretty good one.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah, dear apology.  It's like dear Abby or something, you know?  Exactly. 
[01:29:30]  That's what I was thinking.  You just say what I was thinking.  It's amazing.  Somebody tells me.  We got Bobo on the line.  Oh, great.  Good.  I don't know, Ann.  You want to talk to Bobo about what happened?  I want to talk to Bobo about that and a couple other things.  Other things going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobo.  Yeah, yeah, my friends were, he was very obnoxious.  Well, before we talk, before we ask you some questions, Bobo, your voicemail on the FU line  was a little rough, so I would really appreciate if you did a live apology. 
[01:30:00]  Jim Norton's listening.  He doesn't really feel like talking at this moment right now.  So, why don't you, you know, spill your guts out to Jim Norton.  Hey, well, Jimmy, I'm very sorry for what happened.  I did not know my friends were going to be obnoxious.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Heartfelt.  This is everything right now.  You got your whole career with the Opie and Anthony show on the line right now.  Norton's just looking down at his fucking phone right now.  I am really deeply sorry, all right? 
[01:30:30]  I did not mean for that whole ordeal to happen.  These people, the only reason they showed up, there was two people I was originally going  to bring with me that really wanted to go with me, but they bailed out at the last minute,  and I felt embarrassed with the two extra spots.  I said, what the heck am I going to do with these two extra spots now at that show? 
[01:31:00]  So, a few of my friends called in who happened to be in the city that went with me to a Met  game earlier that day, and I just thought, hey, you guys want to go with me to see Jim  Norton, and I didn't know Jonathan was going to act like this, and I was very pissed off  at him.  I was yelling at him the whole show, not the whole show, but after what happened, and 
[01:31:30]  I was just very upset at night.  I think I came home crying upset about what might happen because of this, all right?  For him ruining something, it means a lot to me.  Being here associated with you guys, it means a lot to me, and I was just so upset at him, 
[01:32:00]  and the whole, and I didn't even get over this the whole weekend, what happened, I was pissed  off at him.  Well, what did he say to you, Daniel, when you asked him about it, when you were yelling  at him, what was his response?  No, I was very sorry, but the guy was pissed drunk, all right?  Like, I mean, I remember, even before the game, he was very drunk, all right? 
[01:32:30]  He was drinking a lot of beers at some bar somewhere right before the game, and that  day, I was just, I didn't know he was going to act like this, and even his brother was  complaining.  His brother was sort of, was a designated driver, and I did not even want to ride home  with this guy, all right? 
[01:33:00]  Right.  I said, you know what?  You guys go back to Long Island on your own.  I'm taking a train, even if it takes me so, so freaking long.  That showed him, right?  Didn't that show him taking hours to get home instead of a few minutes by car?  You showed him there, Bobo.  How long did it take you to get home?  Oh, I think I waited like maybe an, almost an hour.  Well, the train ride got quick, all right?  It was like an hour or something, right? 
[01:33:30]  Because it was just the 7 train was right there.  So, but waiting for that Q18, I waited an hour for the Q18.  Well, you showed your friends, though.  That's the important thing.  You take free tickets and not give me a ride home.  What a coincidence.  You have an IQ of 18, and you're waiting for the Q18.  I mean, and then he just makes noises.  I came home that night, and my mother was wondering, why was I so angry? 
[01:34:00]  Rupert!  Weren't the tickets for your mother?  I kind of remember that we were going to give the tickets to your mother.  Yeah, yeah.  No, my mother said she was considered a guard, but she wasn't feeling well either.  Wow, this sounds like super bad.  She wasn't feeling well, and the other two people that were going to go with me  that really wanted to go to this show with me, right?  They're really good friends of mine.  Yeah.  These are married couples that are great friends of mine,  and they're great friends of my mother's. 
[01:34:30]  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  All right, we get it.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Who did you want to take to the comedy show?  I wanted...  It was going to be these two friends of mine.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Didn't you ask a girl?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, who did you ask?  All right, who did you ask?  Well, after my friends bailed out,  one of the people I asked was this friend of mine, a Melinda. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  Now, Bobo, how did you meet Melinda?  Well, your gig in Smithtown the other day.  Right, right.  And this girl, Melinda, was there?  Yeah, I was talking to her with me and my cousin.  Oh, and she, from what I hear from you,  she was showing an interest in you.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah?  And I also heard something that Danny brought up 
[01:35:30]  that you admitted to,  that when you were asked who you masturbate to,  what girl did you mention?  I think I mentioned her.  Yeah, you mentioned her.  So, have you been in touch with her?  I didn't.  I talked to her on Facebook.  On Facebook.  So, are you making any headway with her or anything? 
[01:36:00]  I don't know.  I'm waiting for a response to the message.  Unfortunately, the computer froze right after it was in touch.  Oh, oh.  So, she didn't want to go to the comedy club with you?  What happened?  You asked her out on a date?  No, I kept, I didn't hear back from her.  Oh, because your computer froze.  Yeah, yeah, I was waiting.  Right.  Plus, I'd be sitting in front of a dial-up connection  holding up a phone line all day.  Yeah, yeah, I hear you. 
[01:36:30]  Melinda.  Yeah, Melinda.  She was at the gig, huh?  Melinda, Melinda?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, have you ever met her before?  The previous time I had met her prior to that, I had talked to her a little bit.  It was in the audience of the Ron and Fez show back in the day.  Right, back in the day.  Oh, oh.  Melinda.  Wow.  You know something?  Don't you think it would be a little disrespectful for somebody to maybe, you know, start dating 
[01:37:00]  or trying to date somebody that was going out with somebody that you knew for like, you know, nine years?  Yeah.  Let's say this Melinda girl was going out with somebody that you knew, right?  Yeah.  For nine years.  And then you tried to go out with her.  Don't you think that's disrespectful to the guy that went out with her for nine years? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, but I kind of thought that a lot of time has passed.  Between what?  Between maybe the, whatever bit of time has passed since the guy she was with and that.  Wait, what guy?  Yeah, what guy?  Do you know who the guy is?  Yeah, yeah, I know she was with you.  Oh, Bobo.  Bobo.  She might have been with a few other, been through a few other relationships.  Well, of course. 
[01:38:00]  We've been broken up for about two years now.  I just think it's a little disrespectful of you to then try to, you know, shove it in my face.  Well, I wasn't trying to do that, all right?  Don't get feisty with me.  He's hitting on your head.  No, no, he's under the impression she was hitting on him.  Oh, my God.  Wait, was she at the show?  No, she was at the band thing. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  She came down to the cake.  Last Friday?  All right.  Yeah.  So, Bobo.  Oh, my God.  You think she's into you a little bit, huh?  Yeah, she sounded like she was.  Yeah, you want me to help you out?  I could probably put in a good word for you, tell you the truth.  Sure.  Yeah?  What do you like about her?  Yeah, what do you like about her?  Tell us.  Oh, I won't.  Not many people know I have an accent fetish.  A what?  No, an accent fetish. 
[01:39:00]  An accent fetish?  What's an accent fetish?  No, like that Long Island accent she had.  Like, damn, that accent was just giving me a boner.  It's kind of Brooklyn.  Her accent was giving you a boner?  Yeah, like she had that sexy accent to her.  I get it.  I was trying to resist getting a boner.  You were trying to resist getting a boner just talking to her? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, and her just talking to me.  Before I write this, with due respect, okay?  Oh, of course.  I'm trying to fight getting a boner.  So she's talking to you, and with the accent that you have a fetish for,  and you had a very hard time keeping your boner at bay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was trying to fight the boner.  Yeah, fight the boner.  And, like, what was she talking to you about? 
[01:40:00]  Was it anything interesting?  Oh, she would say she likes hearing me on the show and everything.  Yeah.  She was just talking about me, and I even never expected that her,  out of all people, would be talking about me in the way she did.  Oh, yeah?  What was she saying?  Oh, she was saying she is interested in me,  and she was, like, amazed that I'm on the market, as I like to say.  Oh, she was saying that she's amazed you're on the market. 
[01:40:30]  Wow.  Well, not like, well, that wasn't how she said it.  How'd she say it?  I don't remember what the word, but she, but the way she was talking,  that's pretty much the way it was.  You knew what she was saying.  Yeah, yeah, you felt the vibe, right?  I don't think I'm the only one that hears Bobo's voice changing a little bit as he talks about her.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  You're getting a little turned on just even talking about this, Bobo.  Yeah, well, it's kind of helped a little bit ease the pain that I'm dealing with around where my kidneys are. 
[01:41:00]  His kidney pain.  Well, it's a good thing that can be cured by a boner.  So now you've relieved yourself.  You've masturbated.  Thinking of her?  Yeah, I did.  So what do you think?  A few times?  It happened once.  Yeah, so what were you thinking about?  What was the fantasy?  Run us through the fantasy of what you were thinking about when you were jacking off. 
[01:41:30]  No, I was just hearing her accent, and I'm just like jacking off.  What was she saying in her accent?  I know that she was saying, she was like saying that you've got to, she was saying you've got the honor of having what once was Anthony's.  And she was just like shoving my cock in her. 
[01:42:00]  She was shoving your cock in her.  Yeah, she was like saying, you need this, Bobo.  She was saying, you don't know if you might not make it through your next surgery.  So you need this, and it was in that accent that you love so much.  How does the accent go? 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  It's like a Brooklyn-ish.  Like, I could tell she's, I never asked her, but I'm sure she's probably an Italian.  Uh, well, not really, but she's, uh, she's from Brooklyn, originally.  Do you do an impression?  Do an impression of her as best as you can.  No, no, I can't, I can't do it.  Like, I don't, Bobo, you, I still love you on the show.  You know what I'm thinking, Ant?  Yeah? 
[01:43:00]  You gotta punish him.  This is very disrespectful.  It's very disrespectful.  First to my show, and now to Anthony.  I know, I know.  You do it, Daniel.  And you know, you know, like, when you were a kid, and, I don't know, your parents caught  you smoking or whatever, and your dad would make you smoke the whole pack right in front  of him to get sick.  Right, right, right.  I think Bobo needs to fucking masturbate right now for everybody.  Bobo?  That's his, I think that should be his punishment.  Where are you, Bobo?  Oh, I don't know, that's the thing, I'm in my room, but I got too many people home, my  mother's home right now.  But, um, but if you're in your room. 
[01:43:30]  That's not our problem, that you were disrespectful at, uh, Jim Norton's show, and, and, and this  thing with Melinda, Anthony's ex, that's, that's a touchy, that's a touchy subject,  so.  That's, uh, wow.  I don't give a crap that your mom's home.  You know, I, I, I did not, I, I did not mean for that, for that, that.  Why don't you just, Bobo, why don't you just whip it out and start cranking it and talk  as if Melinda was right there in the room with you?  Either that or say goodbye to the O&A crowd. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  All right, all right, all right, I'll do it.  So, so just, yeah, get, get, get cranked, really fantasize about it, and, and I want to  hear you talk, what would you say to Melinda if she was in the room with you?  Yeah, whatever it is, it's okay.  And also, I don't want to hear no whispering, man.  I don't care that your mom's downstairs.  You disrespected Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia.  Right.  All right, all right, all right, I'll do this.  Think of that accent.  Yeah, think of the accent. 
[01:44:30]  Too bad I didn't have an accident fetish.  Yeah.  An accent fetish.  All right, all right, uh, hi, I'm Melinda, it's great to see you.  It was a great, it was a great time the other, the other night.  I'm glad to see you.  I need, I really feel like very stressful, kidney pain right now.  Sexy talk.  His kidney pain.  Right, right.  And then she's easing the pain. 
[01:45:00]  She's, like, telling me, oh, she'll ease the pain.  And she's just, like, bringing me right, really close to her.  And she's convincing me that, like, like, I don't know her hand lupits or something.  Like, she's just, she's just pulling off her shirt.  And she's, uh, I think she's dropping down her panties, like, really slow. 
[01:45:30]  She's dropping down her panties really slow.  And we go down on her.  And it's, like, she's what, what, it's what, it's like that, that boulder's, like, out of control.  And that's it, it's, like, it's out of control.  I don't think I've been resisting it.  It's there.  And she's, she's, she's, like, pulling me up.  And she's, like, getting really, really close to me. 
[01:46:00]  And I'm just ramming that cock in her pussy.  Oh!  She's, like, like, ramming in me.  She's, like, I don't know, she's, like, screaming.  And she's, like, begging me to say it.  She was saying, she was, like, saying, dude, she was saying, she was, like, saying, yeah, yeah, you like this, Bobo.  You like this?  You've never felt this before.  And I said, yeah, yes, I do. 
[01:46:30]  And she's, like, saying, yeah, Bobo, you're lying.  And I said, no, I'm not lying.  And she's, like, oh, she's, like, going harder at me.  And I'm just giving it to her harder, harder.  And she's liking it.  And she's, like, telling me that she, she wants it up the shitter.  So I'm just, I'm pounding her at the shitter. 
[01:47:00]  I'm just pounding her.  And I just keep pounding her.  And all of a sudden, she's, like, she's, like, all fucking, like, cocked her.  Asked her mouth.  I never even got that.  She's never got an ATM.  Nine fucking years, I never got asked her mouth.  You never got an ATM now.  Bobo's getting it first fucking time out of the shoot. 
[01:47:30]  Sorry, Bobo, continue.  Yeah, she's, like, fucking dry.  I, I mean, she, I mean, she, uh, is, and she's, like, saying, she's, like, saying, like, saying, you know, she, you say, she's, like, she's, like, sucking dry.  And she's, like, and she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, I don't know, she's, like, grabbing my cock.  And she just wants, I've just, like, come all over her face. 
[01:48:00]  Right, I'm, like, now I'm going to have to, like, now I'm going to have to put a bunch of sheets in the laundry now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bobo.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, that's some fantasy you got there.  You think you could ever make it come true? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, I, I, I think I could.  Yeah?  That's Anthony's ex.  Well, you know, you got to move on, Opa.  I'm thinking, you know, you know, thinking, listening to Bobo talk, it sounds like he's got things pretty well in hand.  Uh, I think he could probably, uh, you know, you know, maybe he's, uh, maybe he'll be all right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm more than the one that made, even that that happened, right?  Oh, you weren't the one that made the first move. 
[01:49:00]  She came up to you.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's not your problem that you're, you know, in the club and.  Bobo's sitting there, I'm in a, I'm in a, I fucked up with this broad, I'm in a bad spot.  I'm in a bad spot.  I'm sure I love you, you couldn't help it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah, she came up to you.  So where is the relationship now between you two?  Well, I don't think it's doing that for us.  If I've just talked to her, I sent her some messages on Facebook. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  And she, she, she takes, she, she admits she sometimes takes, she, she doesn't, she takes  forever to respond.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  That sucks.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, yeah.  So I'm waiting, I'm waiting, hopefully I'll, hopefully I'll be speaking to her soon.  Any interest in any, um, I don't know, news traffic girls?  No, I'm not, I'm not sure that, that would be a, that would be difficult to, uh, to, to 
[01:50:00]  encounter, to run into any news traffic girls, because that, that, that's all having to be  at the same place.  Oh, this is, this is Bobo's hot chick list I got here in front of me.  Oh, you got a hot chick list?  It's Bobo's hot chick list.  All right.  All right, Bobo, let me see.  And this is in, uh, in, uh, order, I guess?  I don't know.  In some kind of order?  Although there's no order in it.  And there's more to the list.  There's no order in his world.  Oh, I know. 
[01:50:30]  Let's see, um, Christina, Christina?  Oh, the Christina that we used to talk to from that other channel.  Okay.  Uh, Philly Jen, uh, Nicole of the Morning Mashup, uh, Kate from Lost, Snooki.  Snooki!  Oh, the accent fetish.  That chick from, what is that?  That chick from Bear Money? 
[01:51:00]  Beer Money.  Oh, you spelt it Bear Money.  Oh, Beer Money.  Yes.  Ha ha ha!  Uh, Megan Fox, uh, Heather Height, Jennifer Love Hewitt, uh, Kesha, JWoww,  and then we got Melinda, followed closely by Jill Nicolini.  Wow, Bobo.  Well, when I was back before you were with her, for quite a while, you guys were talking about her. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  While I was listening to the show, I would turn on my TV to Channel 11.  Yeah.  And when I saw what she looked like, the next day I saw her on TV, I couldn't help but resist, uh,  dragging her to her.  Jesus Christ.  He's jacking it to her.  He's a jack factory in his room.  This was back in 2007.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Sam, you got something on this? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  On the other side of the paper is the list.  I had him write his list of hot chicks.  Yeah.  And then the other list would be the list of the men that he would have sex with if it  meant he got to have sex with.  Oh, to get to the hot chicks.  Right.  So he had to write a list just as long of men that he wouldn't mind having sex with.  Oh, okay.  If it meant.  Topping off the female list was intern Jill, former intern, uh, Lily, and then Amy Schumer  is on that list. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, very good.  Amy actually probably would.  Would.  In a drunken bitch.  Fuck Bobo.  She's actually talked about him.  Yeah.  Yeah, you really should, uh.  Pursue Amy.  Pursue the Amy Schumer thing, Bobo.  Uh, what, uh, Fez tops the list of guys Bobo would bang to get the chicks.  To get to the hot chicks.  Fez.  Fez.  And then the voice of Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  That's the second guy on his list is the voice of Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger 
[01:53:00]  Force.  He goes, I don't know the guy's name.  I don't know the guy's name.  Then Bob Kelly.  Hey, and, uh, I'm sure the president would love to know that Obama has made the list.  After Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  You know what, dude?  You got your mouth, you got your cock, you got your balls.  Boom.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  If you're gonna go gay, you're gonna pick Bob Kelly over the president?  Yeah.  Then, uh, why is the corpse of Tippi Tom on here?  That's a little odd.  Intern David.  You have sex with him.  Any elected official that hates guys, oh, gays. 
[01:53:30]  If they were drunk.  Steve-O.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Jim Norton.  For him, I would dress in drag.  George W. Bush.  Governor Patterson.  Um.  He wants to fuck a lot of politicians.  Mustard.  And then any gay guy from TMZ.  There you go. 
[01:54:00]  That's Bobo's list.  We got a picture of Master Shake on the screen.  Oh, that's Master Shake.  Who does he look like?  Yeah, the voice of Master Shake.  Who does he look like?  He looks like any IT guy.  Yeah, that's pretty much right.  Um.  Wow.  So, all right.  You know something, Bobo?  I think I'm gonna put in a good word for you with Melinda.  All right.  I have a follow-up, too, by the way.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  I didn't realize that I got an email to the real Jim Norton from, uh, it says, apology  for the behavior at Caroline's. 
[01:54:30]  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Jimmy.  I definitely owe you and your buddies an apology for the way I was behaving this past Saturday  at Caroline's.  I was the belligerent guy that came with Bobo.  Normally, I'm well-behaved.  But we had a long day of drinking, starting before the Met game earlier that day.  Please do not be mad at Bobo.  He called me today hysterical because the studio has suspended him again due to my immature 
[01:55:00]  actions.  How would he get suspended from a place you don't work?  I should have known better, and this is my apology for acting like a bad fan.  Sorry, man.  Hope this clears shit up for mine and, more importantly, Bobo's name.  P.S.  I would have called the show and apologized there, but didn't want to bring down the mood.  And he signed it, the ashamed-of-himself fan, Jonathan.  So he was drunk?  All is forgiven.  Jimmy is just such a good guy.  I, but that's a guy who realized he was just too-  Fuck him!  Nah, he was just too drunk. 
[01:55:30]  It's all right, Jonathan.  You'll learn Bobo's just a good guy.  Poor Bobo.  He decided that he would punish himself and not get a nice ride home.  See?  He, I'd rather take the subway, he said.  And wait for the Q-18, was it?  Yeah, the Q-18.  The Q-18 for over an hour.  All right, Bobo.  I Facebooked you back, by the way, Bobo.  All right, I actually read that message.  Oh.  You know, Bobo, know what I'm thinking?  Free appetizer for you at FH Riley's. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Thanks, thanks, Hopey.  Not free dinner.  Free appetizer.  Just an appetizer.  Just an app.  On me.  And Bobo, I'm going to make sure Melinda gets back to you on the Facebook there.  All right, no problem.  Be sure she leaves her number.  Oh, well, I'm sorry.  Oh, poof.  You know what?  Why don't I just give it to you now?  Is Melinda acting or something?  What's going on?  What is she doing?  Well, that wouldn't be a good idea, giving me a phone number on the air. 
[01:56:30]  Well, that really wouldn't be.  And it's not my place, but I'll pass the message on, and I'm sure she'll get back to you.  What do you think, as far as a date goes, would be a, you know, quickly, what would be a good date night for you guys?  Where would you take her, since the Jim Norton comedy thing didn't quite pan out?  Well, there's a few places I could take her.  I was looking on her Facebook.  Look, for one thing, I noticed there was pictures of her at a Met game. 
[01:57:00]  Ah, she is a very big Met fan.  Oh, boy, and so is Bobo here.  I was thinking maybe if I can get a hold, if somehow someone could get a hold of tickets to a Met game for me, I could bring her with me to a Met game.  Ah, how would you get her there?  Well, I would, well, depending on where she is, if there's a way she could meet me somewhere at the Woodside train station.  Oh, so then you two would take the train.  Didn't you guys take limos together? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  And then I can't afford, I can't afford, I can't afford a limo.  We went to Mets Yankees World Series.  But you know what, Bobo, that's what she's used to, the high life.  Yeah.  Nah, she'll meet you at a train station.  Yeah.  Well, it depends if I could find a connection, if there's a connection I have, if I had a connection at a limo somewhere.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, if I had that kind of connection, but the thing is, I would... 
[01:58:00]  The train's fine.  Yeah, yeah, if she could, if she, if she has to hop on a Long Island, if she could hop on a Long Island Railroad, meet me at Woodside station.  Exactly.  Meet you at Woodside, and then you take the train.  Where, where, where do you take the train from Woodside?  You take the seven train to the stadium, right?  Yeah, yeah, I take the seven train to the stadium.  Right.  Oh, okay.  And I'd actually be nice enough, even after the game, I would, I would, I would escort her all the way to her house. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, you would?  Yeah, I would.  Well, that's very nice.  Do you think you'd be invited in?  Yeah, if, if, if everything went okay the day, like, if I treated her okay, I would, if, if she, if she was okay with everything I did for her at the game.  Yeah, invited in for, you know, maybe a, a, a nightcap, a little after game drink or something like that.  Nightcap.  Yeah, yeah, exactly. 
[01:59:00]  Like, for example.  Larry Tate.  She, she, she, she, like that.  You just keep talking.  Yeah, of course.  You know, like, Bobo, can you get, can you get me, can you get me a hot dog?  And I, and I go out of my seat, and I wait online, and I get the hot dogs for her.  For an unsexy food.  But Bobo, don't you, wouldn't you have those seats where you can just have, you know, punch in, and the waitress comes over and, and takes your order?  Well, if, if, if someone can get me seats like that, I would love that.  Well, all right, we'll try. 
[01:59:30]  What about a luxury box?  I want to know about the nightcap and what happens as the nightcap's going down.  Yeah, yeah.  So you have your nightcap.  How does this date end?  You went to the game.  You had a great time.  The Mets won.  You guys are all excited.  Would you buy her a Mets cap or something so she can remember you by?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I would, I would, I would, I would get, I would get, I would get, I would get her a hat.  You know what?  Get her a Mets jersey with Bobo on the back.  I hear the love in his voice.  I'm going to give him a phone number.  Yeah.  I'm going to give her, I'm going to give you her number there, Bobo. 
[02:00:00]  What the hell?  You got a pen?  I got a pen, but first of all, are you sure this is, this is, you know, giving her, giving her phone number?  Yes, it's legal.  Yeah, you don't really have to worry about, uh, on the air.  No, I'm not doing it on the air.  I'm going to take you off the air for a second.  Are you ready for the number?  All right.  5-1-6.  All right.  9-2-2.  9-2-2. 
[02:00:30]  Call us immediately.  9-4-6-3.  9-4-6-3.  9-4-6-3.  4-6-3.  There you go.  All right, right.  All right, all right, all right, 9-2-2.  9-4-6-3.  Don't, I'll give you a clue, though.  Uh, don't call too much.  Uh, you know, but, but call, but call right away.  That's okay.  All right, all right.  I'm going to, I'm going to have to hang up here.  Yeah, hurry, call her right now.  She's waiting for your call.  All right?  You know how it went.  She texted me and said she's waiting for your call. 
[02:01:00]  Yep.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Bobo.  We got to go.  All right.  There goes Bobo.  All's forgiven.  You're back with the show.  He couldn't get off the phone quickly enough to dial, to dial Jackie the Joke Man.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  All right.  Well, let me take a break.  Is Bill Burr here?  Yes.  Oh, he is.  Fuck.  Let's get Bill Burr in here.  All right.  Bill Burr and Jim Jeffery is making their way into the studio. 
[02:01:30]  I've got to go to Sean in Rochester real fast.  It is, Sean.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just watched a today show getting ready, and some 13-year-old girl just said,  cunt, twice, to Meredith.  Yeah, it's coming in a lot, so I guess it happened.  We're trying to get the audio.  Oh, yeah.  What was the circumstance?  Like, what happened?  They're talking about some, I guess some girl got beat to, like, half to death over a text 
[02:02:00]  message.  Yeah.  And they were asking her what the text messages she saw said, and she just said it, and...  Oh, that's great.  Really?  We called her a cunt.  Yeah, it was pretty wild.  And then I heard Meredith Vieira gave her a scolding or something?  Yeah, she just said, you know, please watch your language, honey.  Ah, Meredith.  Cunt.  Thank you for the heads up.  We'll get the audio on the air soon.  Look who's joining us.  All right, brother.  Look who's joining us.  Bill Burr and Jim Jefferies in studio.  Jim Jefferies.  Hello, gentlemen.  Bill Burr.  Let me get the plugs in.  Bill Burr's going to be at Caroline's this weekend, right, Bill? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  So starting tonight through, and Sunday, it says.  Oh, no, I guess...  Yeah, Sunday's out.  Okay, no, never mind.  Oh, wow.  It says Sunday, 12 a.m., so that's a...  They're looking at a third show Saturday night for you.  Yeah.  You're that guy now at Caroline's.  Yes, I am.  They're working me like a dog.  Holy shit.  No, I've always had the third show, and like 25 people show up.  Like, ah, let's get through this quick.  What's the deal with everything? 
[02:03:00]  Good night, everybody.  You feel good because you've got two sold-out shows, so they go, look, let's go for a third.  Yeah, no.  They have to ruin it all for you.  It's kind of one of those things.  Somebody finally told me that.  Just do three on Saturday rather than doing the one on Sunday because the same 150 people  show up.  That's a good idea.  And then Jim Jefferies is at the Stress Factory starting tonight, right, Jim?  Yep.  We want to know.  Are you drunk?  No.  I saw your tweet about 5.30 in the morning saying...  I've apologized to all of you individually for the last time I was here.  I apologize.  It's great.  Yeah, I watched about five minutes of it back on the internet. 
[02:03:30]  Now, I've got to say, because I did come in, last time I was here, I was plied with so  much drugs, it was unbelievable, right?  And I had a girlfriend at the time, and then I was hitting on that thing, so I lost that  girlfriend.  Because people kept on putting it up on the fucking internet.  Like, this whole thing of me just openly saying I'm on drugs, and then I shag some bird  or something.  And I was actually writing to people to get it taken down, but they were putting it up faster  than I could put it on.  There's no fighting the internet. 
[02:04:00]  There's no damage control on the internet.  No, no, no.  It's over.  Once it's done, it's done.  The damage burst.  Spreads like the plague.  I was amiss, and I'd like to openly apologize for the last time.  Oh, I don't even think one's necessary.  So you are sober.  That's a drag for everybody.  Yeah.  That's why people want to hear me wasted now, don't they?  It was a lot of fun last time.  He's apologizing for great radio.  I know, right?  Sorry, I made your job easy.  Thanks for apologizing.  Jesus.  Bill, the Gary Coleman photos, someone was telling me you were all pissed off about that. 
[02:04:30]  Iraq was telling me.  Oh, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  He just told me about it.  I didn't follow that.  I was real depressed when he died.  Yeah.  We had him on, man.  It was depressing.  At my age, just to know, even with kidney failure, somebody can die at that age.  Yeah, he was kind of freakish.  Yeah.  Yeah, not just kind of a regular guy.  It means that you'd go to bed at a chance.  No, I understand, but you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's just still like, I thought that there was going to be, he was going to have the Travolta  comeback, you know, like Tarantino would somehow figure out how to make him a badass. 
[02:05:00]  You know what I mean?  He'd have the two chrome guns.  And all of a sudden, you know, Gary's back.  Bring in the midget.  Coleman.  Yeah.  Some of the medical breakthroughs, they could grow a couple kidneys in like a Petri dish.  Yeah.  Help him out.  Help him out.  But obviously, his wife was a right cunt, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, someone's going on with her.  She's got to be.  Like that whole 911 call where she's just like going, don't, and she goes, I suffer from  seizures.  I'm very suspect of her, by the way.  I'm very suspect of this whole thing.  I heard Oprah already called that maybe she was involved. 
[02:05:30]  No, Anthony.  I was, yeah, I was.  No, I said Outdoors Gay.  We got a couple things going on on the show.  I've been watching too many shows, those crime shows.  Yeah, you know, the real ones.  Not CSI or something like that, but you know, that first 48, and then cold case files.  First 48 is going to get somebody killed.  It already, well, they're saying they were kind of responsible for somebody being shot  in Chicago.  Oh, why wouldn't they?  I like when they black out somebody's face, but they leave their voice. 
[02:06:00]  Like if I, they blacked out your face, like I wouldn't know that was you.  Yeah, you wouldn't know it's me.  And you're standing in front of your vehicle, but they blacked out their license plate.  Gee, there sure are a lot of El Caminos out there.  I wonder who that is.  There's some hardcore motherfuckers too, like killers, and they just barely pixelate some  guy's face.  Dude, I saw one.  I saw one where there was like an eight-year-old kid who saw the shooting.  So they walk up to the kid's house.  They're showing the kid's entire house. 
[02:06:30]  And then they black out his face.  And then they pan for, just in case the criminals.  No, they didn't black out his face.  Oh, Jesus, Anthony.  Really?  Still?  Hey, kid, close your eyes, kid.  They just, still.  You think he's going to change?  You know, you just figured.  You know, it started off, he seemed like he had a little sympathy for Gary Coleman.  He was siding on him.  And I was like, maybe he flipped a little bit.  I do.  I have a lot of sympathy for Gary Coleman.  I think he was murdered.  I think he was murdered.  By what, that pure white woman? 
[02:07:00]  By that horrid woman.  I want to know what they panned to.  They panned to basically what the kid saw, the crime.  So just in case the guys was just so fucking stupid that they couldn't figure out what  house that was, they showed its juxtaposition to what the kid saw.  To where the crime was?  It's within shooting distance, yeah.  Yeah, they do it.  Very obvious where the witness lives.  Yeah, they show their house.  Come on.  Their whole body from the neck down, their car.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  They had a big issue in Chicago. 
[02:07:30]  They were serving an arrest warrant for some guy.  And it was a murder rap.  So they took the crew down, the camera crew.  They got one of the teams together that busted out the house.  They busted open the door.  And there are allegations that right as the door opened, one of the cops fired into the room  and hit a girl, like nine, ten-year-old girl, and killed her.  And this was all on video from First 48.  So the Chicago mayor has now said there will be no more cameras following around police during 
[02:08:00]  any of these activities.  Exposing what we're doing.  But it's like exposing what we're doing.  It's like that gay guy who got tasered off the cliff the other day.  What was that?  Or the porn guy.  Yeah, the porn.  Was he a gay porn star or was he a regular?  No, I think he was regular.  Good for him.  I'm good for him.  But it was that whole thing they go, because of the taser, it made him fall off.  He was jumping already.  He was jumping.  Yeah, he was doing the old suicide by cop. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, suicide by cop.  You pull out fucking something shiny and point it at him real quick, and you're done for.  Close your eyes and look the other way.  That's it.  I didn't kill myself.  At least I could be buried in a real cemetery.  I don't know.  Yeah, but doesn't God know what you're thinking?  No.  God knows what you're thinking, then technically you don't get in.  Yeah, isn't that a technicality?  But, I mean, come on.  You can still get in.  Right?  Wait, you're saying if you kill yourself, you don't get into heaven? 
[02:09:00]  You go to purgatory, which is just a shit thing going on.  That's not fair.  I'm planning on killing myself one day.  I don't need this heaped on.  Now the whole afterlife is going to be fucked up.  There's no God.  What a ridiculous thing to say.  What a ridiculous American fucking idea.  Yeah, because we're the only ones in the world.  No, 85% of Americans believe in God.  In Australia, it's like 32%.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wow, they're so advanced over there.  Yeah, they really are. 
[02:09:30]  That's great.  A bunch of kangaroo rapists.  That and men at work.  Crocodile Dundee.  We believe, we believe, we believe in men at work.  What do the rest believe in?  Nothing.  Just nothingness?  Just cricket.  Cricket.  Yeah, I'd say.  Just, you know, casual racism.  You don't believe in, there's not a big religious thing going on down there, huh?  No, it's too hot for that topic.  Too hot for that.  Yeah, yeah.  So you just think it's just blackness, nothingness?  I just think, no, I just think, of course, when you die, it's like- 
[02:10:00]  It's over.  Yeah, it's like-  It's like before you were born.  Before you were born, same thing.  No, you become part of the earth.  Yeah.  That's basically, that's what we're supposed to be doing.  Physically.  We're not supposed to be put in caskets.  You're supposed to go on the ground and become like a fossil fuel or like limestone.  You just get impacted down.  Yeah.  I think after a while-  You make a canyon.  No matter what it is, it kind of happens, right?  Even if you're in a casket, you know, a thousand years ain't going to do it, but maybe 10,000,  there'll be nothing left.  You should get burnt when you die.  You shouldn't get put in a casket and get- 
[02:10:30]  Ah, put them in the ground, enrich the soil.  No, yeah, burn and then just scatter ashes, because you put someone in a fucking box under  the ground, people are going to keep coming along.  We're going to run out of ground space.  It's just common maths, right?  Yeah.  But also, if people don't take care of the gravestones, after the kids, grandkids don't  give a fuck.  They're never cleaning up the tombstone.  As time goes by, it's an eyesore.  You only get one generation of care.  You get one more generation of care on your tombstone, and after that, you're a fucking 
[02:11:00]  nobody.  The grandkids ain't picking weeds out from there.  Yeah, no one cares.  No one's cleaning that thing.  Cleaning up the flowers.  God's eyes truth right there.  Yeah, and if you didn't have kids, you don't even get a generation.  You get fucking nothing.  You get till your brother dies.  That's true, because you go to a funeral, you go to the cemetery, they plant whoever  you're fucking planting, and then when you're walking out, you look down at some of those  headstones in there.  They're pretty old.  Yeah.  And you know no one's been in front of that thing with any emotion for fucking years. 
[02:11:30]  Some creepy historian.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Looking you up in the town records.  He was a cobbler.  He was a cobbler.  That's exactly it.  No one cares, though.  There's no caring, kneeling by the grave and talking to it.  And you've been so much.  Well, I'm saying you shouldn't even go on a cast and just stick you in the ground.  In the ground.  In the ground.  Yeah.  Grow corn over you.  My friend died when I was...  Some snow piece.  When I was 16, my best mate died in a car accident, right? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, that's tragic.  But that's what happened.  Every teenager has a story where someone at school dies in a fucking car.  But then he used to surf every day, so his mum said to me and his other mate and his brother,  said, all right, look, go scatter him out at the beach where he surfed every morning,  right?  So we swam out with his bag of ashes above our heads, like, all crying, you know.  Swam out in the water and made a little circle and said, goodbye, Nick.  You're a good mate.  See you later.  And then we cracked the bag open, just fucking covered in ash. 
[02:12:30]  Just like we went out with such emotion and ran out like fucking, oh, get it off me!  Get it off me!  Yeah, this is his essence, man.  We're going to pour it in the ocean where he was happiest.  This is what's him.  It's his essence.  Ew!  Ew, motherfucker!  You inhale his femur.  It was all over me.  Most of him was showered off in one of those little, you know, those outdoor showers.  Oh, shit! 
[02:13:00]  Yes!  Went down with some green.  That's where he's actually scattered, in the sewerage system of Bondi Beach.  God damn, man.  God, that's funny.  Eh, tragic.  No, Gary Coleman.  Get back to that.  Tragic.  I think it was murder.  Very tragic.  Tragic.  I think it was murder, though.  And now they're talking about some kind of blood spatter evidence that's just not to...  That was just his kidneys.  Doesn't go along with her story.  Nah, there's something going on there.  They're looking into it. 
[02:13:30]  Somebody's going to get arrested.  I think she has no emotion for this guy.  Ah, she's a chick.  She'll get away with it.  Yeah?  She'll do that thing where they put both their hands right above on their breastplate.  I didn't...  And they just get out of it.  That's what the...  That's all they have to do.  I didn't know that strangling him was wrong like this.  They just...  I just...  I was in the kitchen and I...  It's like all those wives are like mob bosses.  It's like they have no fucking idea.  I thought he was a baker. 
[02:14:00]  Really?  Really?  Is that what you thought he was doing?  Yeah, no mob boss wife ever goes away for anything.  And they know everything that went on.  It's like you didn't wonder how a baker drove a Bentley, had a knife out of your soap and  it was a fire men's soap.  Oh, fuck.  Did you see the bedside photo, though?  I saw that.  She looked...  She leaned in, Bill.  Did you see the photo?  It's like she's taking a shot with the fucking...  It looked like Jimmy with Ozzy.  Coleman's got all the tubes and everything. 
[02:14:30]  He's on his deathbed, obviously.  She leans in for the photo like...  She's doing the same leaning that you do when your...  Did she do the peace sign?  Yeah, right.  When your friend's fucked up drunk on the couch.  Yeah.  And you take the photo like...  That's exactly it.  A little faggot on his head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you snap the picture.  There's a cock with a little pissed hat.  Put your ball bag next to him.  The thing is, he looked even smaller when he was dying.  Yeah, he did.  Like, his face, he looked like he got younger at the last moment.  It was...  I said he looked like a preemie baby. 
[02:15:00]  Like a preemie baby.  What's a preemie baby?  Premature baby.  Oh, a premature baby.  Born a bit early.  Yeah, he got all those tubes.  They're always wrinkly little Benjamin Button-looking fucks, aren't they?  Premature babies.  Like, how many times have you seen them in the incubator things and thought,  just fucking slap it on the back of the head at the end of the table and start again?  It's not like you even wasted nine months, darling.  It was out in five.  Get over it and move on.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck, dude?  It was out in five. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, damn.  I'm not even drunk this time.  You're talking about graveyards.  I've got to get this guy on the line.  Justin in Tampa.  Mother drags him to the grave of his...  Of who, Justin?  Uh, my sixth great-grandmother.  Like, great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother from Phoebe.  Why do you guys got to go to her grave?  What's that?  Why do you have to go to her grave?  I have no idea.  It's kind of in a similar cemetery as my great-grandparents. 
[02:16:00]  Because what do you mean...  Without her banging without a condom, he wouldn't be there.  That's basically...  What do you mean kind of similar?  Either it's the same one or it's not.  Because all cemeteries are kind of similar.  Kind of similar, right.  How's the keep around the gravestone?  Is it good?  Yellow.  Holy shit, what a waste of fucking time.  What a waste of fucking time.  How old is he?  Did his mother take him?  I wanted to know, too.  How old is he?  We had a couple questions. 
[02:16:30]  Maybe his phone crapped out.  Who knows?  Whatever.  It's fine.  Yeah, I know.  How old is that?  What does it say?  Wonderful mother.  Great slave owner.  She only whipped them when they were bad.  Great slave owner.  Had seven kids, died at 16.  Yeah.  A pony.  That was really something back then.  Goddamn.  Oh, that's good.  All right, we'll go with an Ash story.  Peter, help me out. 
[02:17:00]  That last call sucked.  Peter in Jersey.  Hey, hey, how you guys doing?  I was talking about, Jim, you're hilarious.  I saw you guys in Fuxville, Pinebrook.  But I'm a pilot.  I manage a flight school up here.  We're dumping ashes over a college in New Jersey.  We open the window.  We let them go.  Half the fucker blows right back into us in our hair.  Oh, shit.  It always sounds good on paper, but we're learning that it's not a good idea.  Why would you fucking dump it over a college?  I don't think the college kids appreciate that. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, the guy worked there forever, and that was like his last dying wish.  We were like, all right, we brought one up the...  What a loser.  Your whole fucking life, and it's a college.  I would have been an urge to sit there just annoying people.  I sucked at everything, and I mowed lawns my...  There's father.  What was his hobby?  How about you fucking go with that one?  Or somewhere you worked for 50 years.  I want to be spread over a hooker. 
[02:18:00]  I go, no, no, you got to drop the fucker out, not me.  I ain't open them.  And then finally, halfway through, he starts all come back to play.  We're like, let the bag go.  I'm sure it's...  Did you say, I'll let the bag go?  Yeah.  I thought you said, let the fag go.  That's a hell of a last wish.  You know, the ashes, 90% of it's coffin, because they burn the box and everything.  And then they just give you a portion of it.  It's not the whole thing.  Yeah.  Why don't they give you the whole thing?  Then they grind it up.  Because it's a fucking...  It's a garbage bag of ashes.  Well, that's creepy, though. 
[02:18:30]  Where's the rest of the ashes?  They give you a little box.  You know, like a...  Like a shoulder and a butt cheek.  Like a party.  It's like going to KFC.  Also...  Let me get a two-piece.  Also, do you think they clean it out after each burning?  There's fucking...  You're getting a bit of someone else's uncle and a bit of someone else's thing.  A lot of people like to think that they got the whole fucking body in their urn.  You're ruining it for everybody.  No, they don't.  They don't.  Why was my friend this big, and then my grandmother was much bigger?  Like, how the fuck did that work out?  Just more ashes, right?  He was much taller than her and everything. 
[02:19:00]  They give you more ashes for your buck.  It's the breast.  So...  It makes a lot of ashes.  So all these people with urns, they only got part of their loved one in there?  Yeah, they've only got part of their loved one.  They've got part of someone else's loved one.  I'm trying to...  Because they don't...  It's not like they clean that up and out.  They just scrape a bit from the end.  Yep.  Of course they do.  All right.  Thanks a bunch, guys.  All right.  I'm sure you're right, but we don't want to think about it.  And they run the bones through a grinder, too.  Like, they grind them up a little bit.  I think they just put the coffin in and just fucking light the bastard up.  Wait a minute.  What do you mean? 
[02:19:30]  Because the bones don't...  Do they fillet you?  Well, no.  They burn it.  And then, like, what's left, the bones don't really burn.  So they've got to grind it up.  They run it through like...  What do they do with that?  That goes in the urn also.  See, I'd give them to a dog.  I don't know.  I wouldn't mind if a dog was eating my bones.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind that.  There's a big femur in his mouth.  They reckon that so many wankers think that they can donate their skull to the theatre.  And then when they do Macbeth, that my skull will still be performing. 
[02:20:00]  You know what I mean?  Performing.  But there's so many cunts that are doing this.  The theatre companies around the world are like, no more skulls.  We've got enough skulls.  They open a door and there's fucking thousand skulls in a little room.  And every fucking posh cunt who's ever wanted to be on stage.  It's like the tunnels of the Camarouge.  Wow.  Bravo.  Indiana Jones scene.  Yeah.  Looks like the guy opened up his own skull store or something.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Chicago. 
[02:20:30]  Chip sucks.  Hey, buddy.  Congrats on your Blackhawks.  Did you watch the hockey, Bill Burr?  Hold on a second, Tommy.  It was a good series, right?  Yeah, it was great.  It was great.  I thought I was going to go seven just because both teams had waited so long.  I figured they'd torture their fans all the way to the end.  One more night.  Even the way they had the, like, that was the weirdest celebration of an overtime goal ever.  Like, no one even knew it was in.  Like, was it in?  That's what they were saying.  It was like dead silence.  Yeah.  Because they didn't fucking.  Yeah.  Watch the Blackhawks.  Like, three of them stay on the bench.  Like, you know, is this like some sort of like practical joke? 
[02:21:00]  I'm going to start freaking out.  And then they had to like, they literally had to regroup to celebrate again.  Instead of just having that moment happen naturally.  But that is the biggest stunned silence I think I've ever heard.  Yeah.  The light didn't go off and no one called the goal.  But I just mean it was just dead silence.  What the fuck happened?  All right.  Tommy.  Yeah.  So I was like six or seven years old.  I was out in South Carolina. 
[02:21:30]  And my dog had died.  So I brought the ashes out to throw in the ocean.  And I was like halfway out, like up to my waist.  And I went to go take a big handful of ashes.  And I threw it.  And just then a big wave came back and knocked all the ashes back into my face.  And I swallowed some of the water with the ashes in it.  Which then caused me to gag.  So then I vomited.  Then another wave came in.  And I swallowed my own dog vomit.  Who burned your dog?  Is that real?  You saw something like a fucking, one of those Max Tucker stories?  Look at Benny Hill's sketch.  Why did you burn the dog? 
[02:22:00]  Why didn't you just bury the dog in your backyard?  Did you burn it yourself?  Or did you get someone?  We went to, it had to get euthanized.  So we, whatever, the vet sent it out to get it.  My mom was really into the dog.  So she kept a little like keepsake urn of it.  Bury it in the yard.  Yeah, bury it in the yard.  You want your dead pets in your yard?  Just put it in a sack.  Throw it in the river.  People are going to complicate things. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, they certainly do.  How mean were people back in the day when they had that big litter?  And they would, they couldn't have the decency to choke them out.  They'd stick them in the sack with the rock.  Well, just drown them.  Yeah, drown them.  That's the best way.  People still do that though.  It's the most humane way is to drown them.  There's always some kind of, well, it's just, I don't know.  I watch cartoons.  That's my, that's my like history.  I don't watch the history channel.  I always see that in the old cartoons.  Somebody does that.  And then the cartoon cat crawls out of the top and does something heroic.  Why are you going to fuck with my reality, Jeff? 
[02:23:00]  It gets revenge.  Do you want to know about a company that turns your dead loved one into a diamond?  Into a diamond?  I think I've heard about that.  You have heard about this one?  Yeah.  How can you make a diamond out of a dead?  The creepy people are the ones that get their fucking pet.  Sounds like this came out of Germany.  You've seen the pet ones, right?  Yeah.  They, they freeze dry their pets.  Freeze dry the pets and then put them in a position like they're just sleeping.  No, they're taxidermists do it, don't they?  It's fucking, yeah, yeah.  Like it's, it's always action, like it's hunting.  They do that one or sleeping, so you could just lay there and look at him and go, oh, 
[02:23:30]  he's sleeping.  But it's never the licking his own ass position.  You're going to do it.  You might as well go.  You know, you know, they, they basically, they peel the, the whole skin right off.  Like there's no, I don't know what I used to think was in there, but there's nothing.  Oh, it's like a framework of just wire and wood and shit like that.  It's just stuffing, isn't it?  Yeah, no, but they, they, I know a dude was telling me this horrific story about shooting  a deer and actually just saying was the worst thing he ever fucking did.  Yeah.  Like he shot the thing, the thing, he was so deep into the woods, it didn't even have 
[02:24:00]  any fear of human beings.  So it was kind of walking up to him and then he shot it.  It jumped straight up in the air and did like a 180, ran away.  And then like 50 feet away was going like, like fucking making like these human noises  dying.  So then they, they take it to the fucking, uh, the meat market or something.  And this guy comes out, you know, the whole Texas chainsaw murderer guy comes out and  you just fucking, he just peels the skin face, the whole fucking thing right off.  And he says, and there's all kinds of maggots and bugs inside the fur. 
[02:24:30]  It's fucking gross.  While it's alive, it's got that in there.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's not like a, yeah.  But they're not the most flea collars out there.  Are you allowed to taxiderm a human?  Is that legal?  Could you?  They've done those, uh, they've done those shows where they, uh, they use some kind of  epoxy shit.  Yeah, but that guy who does it in the museum.  Yeah, in the museum.  But I'm saying, could you get grandma fucking peel his skin back, stuff the bitch and then  put her at the end of the dinner table?  I don't think you can do that.  On her hands and knees with her pussy up in the air. 
[02:25:00]  Can you explain it?  Improper.  Explain it.  Disposal of a body or something.  Law.  I'm sure there's a law against it.  You can't just have your own grandma stuffed at the end of the table.  Let's go to Todd in Lancaster.  Todd.  Fucking baby powder every day.  Yeah.  He's going to explain the diamond thing.  Todd.  Hey, Pat.  How's it going, boys?  How's it going, Jimmy?  How's it going, Jimmy?  Yeah, they, uh, they take your body and they basically squeeze the shit out of it and  they make a laboratory diamond out of it, like, under extreme pressure.  It's fucking crazy.  Well, they, they burn it first. 
[02:25:30]  Could you, uh, just bring that down to regular guy terms?  Yeah.  That was a little too technical for me.  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't like to squeeze the shit out of it?  Squeeze the shit out of you and those other crazy fucking shit.  Make a diamond out of you.  Thank you.  That's through the process.  I'm so glad you explained it to everybody.  That's the only reason you're on the show.  You know what, Bill?  You're right.  Dumb it down for us common people.  All right, boys.  Jim Jeffery rules.  Thanks, man.  Jim Jeffery's will be at the Stress Factory starting tonight.  Jim Jeffery.  Jim Jeffery rules.  He said Jim Jeffery. 
[02:26:00]  Well, Jim Jeffery's is also banned from a radio station, I have learned.  Oh, you've learned it?  And also, uh, you got, uh, the Jewish, uh, folks.  I've upset the Jews of Kansas.  That's gotta be seven people.  Yeah, right?  How many of them are out there?  I, I, I, I'm recording my new DVD in, in July in Britain.  And I've called it, uh...  Kike Smash.  No, it's a good thing.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  It's called, it's called Alcoholicost.  Right?  Oh, right.  Which I thought is a nice little name for a DVD, right?  Sort of a play on words.  Yeah.  A little play on words. 
[02:26:30]  Alcoholicost.  And it turns out that the Jews think they own the word Holocaust.  And no one else can use it.  And I said, it was a word before then.  And, you know, I'm not referring to any Jewish routines or anything.  Uh-huh.  And then I may have said, it's been 65 years, you've got to get over things.  And that might have upset.  Ah, that's the one that does it.  That's the one that does it.  Because any white supremacist would say the same thing.  No, I was only being a dickhead and being a bit flippant about the whole thing.  And I don't mean that.  I'm not an anti-Semite or anything.  But the Jewish community have gotten... 
[02:27:00]  You went for the joke in that moment.  And then they decided to take it seriously.  And then they decided to take it seriously.  And, uh, yeah, so that's that.  That'll ever hurt you in show business, attacking the Jews.  It's a good move.  And I don't know.  What did they do?  There's no blowback on that.  No way.  It didn't hurt Helen Thomas at all.  Helen Thomas knew 10 presidents, and she fucking wanted to do it all with that shit.  Yeah, way to go, Jim.  They wrote a few letters and stuff.  And those letters don't get outside Kansas.  You're right.  And then I said, in response, they said, well, I also did a lot of jokes about 9-11, and no one said anything about that. 
[02:27:30]  And then everyone remembered I did some 9-11 jokes, so they wrote letters in about that.  Jesus, you just keep digging the hole for that.  Yeah, I was just...  And I blamed the victims of child molestation, you know, just sort of a simple bit.  But I was just having a laugh.  But the thing was, the radio station had me on there for about an hour and a half, right?  What show?  I can't even remember.  It's just one of those, just little pussies.  Johnny Dare's the other one I do over there.  And he was fine.  The Blumberg and Weinstein show. 
[02:28:00]  But no one said anything.  Everyone was laughing.  And then after they get the letter, now they're like, yeah, we were appalled as well by the whole situation.  We were in such shock that it was delayed appalled.  And our shock came out in laughter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And encouragement.  And so we left him on another hour on the show, you know.  I did a joke basically, which was the whole idea of calling American sporting teams like the Cleveland Indians and the Atlanta Braves. 
[02:28:30]  It's a genocided race of people, you know.  If there was a German soccer team called the Munich Jews.  We like to say relocated.  Right, and I did that joke.  If there was a soccer team called the Munich Jews and then everyone, I was trying to prove a point.  That's a good joke.  I mean, it's also, too, the problem with that DVD is a lot of stores wouldn't carry it.  It's like sometimes you've got to think of what will they put in a store.  Alcohol, of course, they may not put up.  Sometimes, like rappers, my friend did this thing for rappers where he would go over their album covers  and they were very adamant about shit that Walmart would carry. 
[02:29:00]  Because, you know, for sales, you might not want to put something they wouldn't carry.  I don't see what is...  Yeah, I must be just an insensitive bloke.  I don't really see the problem with it.  I just thought it was a funny word.  It is.  It's like a holocaust of alcohol.  Yeah.  See?  It's like alcohol-a-cost.  Yeah.  I get it.  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't guess it.  Yes, Chip?  I think you should have called alcohol-a-cost a few dollars or something, you know? 
[02:29:30]  I think Chip is funny.  Chip is funny in his own little way.  Colin loves him.  Yeah.  Taking him under his comedic wing.  We've been listening to you guys.  Stop Giving Bobo is such a hard time, man.  Yeah, you don't like that?  I feel sorry for the poor bad dude.  We gave him a life.  You know what?  Last time...  That's how we look at him. 
[02:30:00]  What does that remind me of?  I gave you life.  You want your life back?  We're God's...  Where is God?  Last time I was here...  He had nothing before us.  I flippantly said that, because he'd never been laid, that I would pay for him to go to  Vegas and get fucked if needs be, right?  Right.  So he comes and sees me at Caroline's, and he says, thank you for the holiday to Vegas  and the hooker.  And I'm like, yeah, that's just radio talk.  You're not getting shit.  I'm sorry.  That didn't happen. 
[02:30:30]  You ain't getting shit.  Sorry for breaking your little retarded virgin heart, but it's not going to happen.  Now, Bobo loves this show.  I know he does.  He's got to do some stuff for us every once in a while.  Like, masturbate while his mom's downstairs.  I've seen the photos of the cherry dart ass thing.  Yeah.  Isn't that fantastic?  It looks like a crime.  Yeah, I think it was, technically.  It looks like the first 48.  The way you guys had blown out his face.  Blur out his face. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, why did you blur his face out in that photo?  Like, that was the thing.  Keep his ball bag in his asshole.  Nice.  Yeah, we've got to blur that out.  We got the clip of the Today Show.  Oh.  I guess a 13-year-old was on there.  What happened?  Saying cunt.  Some 13-year-old live TV.  This is big in America there, Jim Jeffery.  Yeah, you can't say cunt on the air.  You can't say cunt on TV.  You know you can.  Well, you can, but you get yelled at by Meredith Vieira.  This whole idea that girls hate it so much. 
[02:31:30]  Girls love it when I say cunt.  Yeah.  This accent, man.  Well, the accent's in here.  They love that.  They just think that I don't know better.  I know better.  I know better.  It just sounds friendly when you say it.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're from Brooklyn, not so much.  Yeah, there's a difference between your little cunt and your fucking cunt.  He's a bit of a cunt.  Fucking cunt.  Such a fucking cunt.  It is.  It's how you say it there.  But she said it on TV, and Meredith Vieira was not happy.  Can we go back to March 17th, that day that those text messages were exchanged between 
[02:32:00]  Josie and Wayne?  You were in school with Josie.  You heard about the texts?  You saw them?  I only saw two.  You saw two?  Did you see the one where he threatened her to kill her?  No.  You did not.  Which ones did you see?  Oh, no.  The one where she calls him a rapist, and she calls him a cunt.  I mean, he calls her a cunt.  Twice.  I love how she thought the look was, she had the wrong pronoun. 
[02:32:30]  I'm sorry.  I mean, he calls her a cunt.  Sorry.  Remember to see what he's so offensive?  She is.  You're right.  We're in the condition to think it's offensive.  She just called him a rapist.  That is a way more offensive thing than him calling her a cunt.  Exactly.  And one may explain the other.  Yes.  And then Meredith Vieira is outraged.  Why don't you see ahead of time what these fucking text messages say?  Exactly.  That is good.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no little pre-interview with this girl.  A rapist, and she calls him a cunt. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, he calls her a cunt.  We just have to be careful with our language a little bit.  That's all right, sweetheart.  I think I just got an erection.  Yeah.  That was damn sexy.  You've got to be careful with the language, sweetheart.  All right, fucking A, I will.  You asked her what it said.  It's true.  The kid doesn't know the FCC.  She's talking.  Right.  You have no idea you can't say cunt on television.  She called her the C word.  Yeah.  The C word.  That girl has not a clue about, like, rules and regulations of broadcasting. 
[02:33:30]  Of course not.  Why would she?  Amazing.  She just knows it's about little friends calling each other cunt.  Fucking bullshit 13-year-old crap she's got to deal with.  Meredith, watch the language.  What?  What language?  Rapist?  No, the cunt part.  That's somebody behind the scenes job to read that.  She just, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  She's doing, what do I got next?  Oh, yeah.  Some kid's filthy text.  Okay.  What's going on?  Yeah, I'm going to tell her to, like, fucking say what was in the text, even though I have 
[02:34:00]  no clue what the word cunt is in there.  How old was the girl?  Like 13.  13.  Something like that.  Yeah, see, that's it.  13.  Like, it's offensive enough.  I've heard a 13-year-old girl's on television talking about rape, I think.  You call it offensive.  Exactly.  It's all the words for it.  Yes.  Legal technicality.  Yes.  Masturbation fodder.  Enthusiasm.  Yeah, well, I got raped two years ago when I was 14. 
[02:34:30]  That's some amazing audio.  You ever hear that one?  What's that?  Oh, God.  You're strange.  God.  It's a radio contest.  Radio bit gone bad.  It's worth playing again if Bill's never heard it.  It's unbelievable.  What happened?  Somebody gets raped?  No.  I don't even want to give it away.  If we have the audio, I just want to play it for you.  Hey, uh...  No one gets...  No one gets...  Don't worry.  No one gets raped, sensitive West Coast Bill Burr.  Oh, as opposed to how I was before I went out there? 
[02:35:00]  You were a little more angry, I think.  Wasn't I always the one going, dude, I can't believe we just did that to that retarded person  as we walked out?  You remember those guilt walks back to the truck?  All right, I do remember.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Sorry.  You went someplace for 40 years and sit in the sunshine and have one fucking grapefruit  and all of a sudden you care about people?  You think I don't have people walking out on my shows, sending angry emails?  I'm dangerous, too.  Thank you very much. 
[02:35:30]  He will prove that I Caroline's this weekend.  Oh, shit.  The Morning Drive.  What is this?  Station you got banned from?  Oh, I have to read all...  I ain't reading all this shit.  What happened?  What a faggot radio station.  Reading's for stupid people.  Yeah.  That's right.  You're on the Morning Drive on KBEQ.  Oh, is that the one that I got in trouble for?  It's a redneck country station?  I think it might have been a country station.  And here's the note from the vice president after your appearance, Mike Kennedy. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, he's also the morning show host.  Oh, boy.  Vice president for programming and operations and the morning show host.  Wow.  Never good.  Yeah, you know why?  Because there's so many people that are good on talent side and the management side.  I just feel like I've burned a lot of bridges in my Kansas City radio, you know, deals.  Yeah.  So I'm pretty devastated about the whole thing.  Well, just to let you know, over here in the States, that's a real hot market out there. 
[02:36:30]  All American comics are clamoring to get out there to do that Topeka, Wichita run.  Well, he writes, or maybe this was audio, I don't know.  We all agree, the comedian in question.  Oh, they don't even mention your name.  The part of the first part.  This is when your jokes stop being jokes.  All of a sudden, they become statements.  Yeah.  I became aware of his statements.  Wait a minute.  No, it was a joke.  Yeah, it was a joke.  We all agree, the comedian in question should not be back on the air with us in the future. 
[02:37:00]  And we probably should have had that segment ended much quicker.  I was on for another hour.  Can you do that if you stand around and watch a rape?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Maybe we should end this segment quicker.  In hindsight.  In hindsight, we should have stood there and cheered it on for an hour.  Should have ended World War II a little quicker.  Jesus.  Hey, college boy, you're next.  Hey, yeah.  Never good.  I'm quite into that porn now. 
[02:37:30]  That's like a new thing.  What, rape porn?  Where there always seems to be fucking some chick at a college party where everyone else  is just getting drunk around the outside.  Yeah, I've seen those.  You know what I like about that?  It's like, I could be one of those drunk guys.  I don't even picture myself fucking the chick.  I just, you know, having a good time.  Just watching.  Being invited to a party where I'm welcome.  That's all I really want.  That's what he's taking away from these horrific movies.  I don't know.  I don't like the movies that show like people being injured or anything like that. 
[02:38:00]  I don't like any porn.  Or mentally fucked up.  I just like two happy people fucking.  Maybe more.  No, no.  I don't.  I don't like them.  In a station wagon with a have a nice day sticker.  I like to.  Good times.  Country squire.  I don't like lesbian porn.  I need a lot of cock in there.  And one girl being all fucked up by a lot of cock.  I don't like lesbian porn if it's mother-daughter or like something really inappropriate.  That's kind of sexy.  Yeah.  That type of role play. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  It's hot.  And I don't like sex outdoors.  I hate it when they're on the beach or something.  I just think, yeah, yeah, you're going to get burnt.  I hate feet and food.  Feet and food.  I hate when fucking people at some point decide to stick some dirty porno toe in their mouth.  It's fucking disgusting.  We were talking about that yesterday.  And also food.  Food is not sexy.  When you sit there and that nine and a half weeks douchey scene where she's sticking a  Pop-Tart down her throat.  Like, oh, yeah.  Thank you.  People talk about that.  Look at the crumbs right on her cleavage.  No, I've never. 
[02:39:00]  How sexy that is.  It's one of the worst fucking scenes.  It's disgusting.  Food on a body.  Stop it.  Do you remember like about 10, 15 years ago?  Food and sex is disgusting.  Like if you go to a teddy bar and they actually serve like wings, it's like, are you out of  your fucking mind?  I'm not eating that.  Dude, I don't know what happened over here.  About 10, 15 years ago, they brought out chocolate body paint, which was like a fucking  jar of just chocolate shit with this fucking brush.  It wasn't high quality?  And every, every girl, like they couldn't fucking sell enough of them.  Every girl came back with, look at my fucking, I like chocolate. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  And this is going to make your cock taste better or something.  And it was just, just messy.  Messy.  No one wants to eat it.  Yeah.  It's like, ugh.  It's like those fruit roll up edible panties they make.  The cure for salty gym cock.  Does your boyfriend always want to bang you right after the gym?  And he just fucking squirt some chocolate on it?  They, they, they, they made those fruit roll up like, uh, uh, edible undies they called  them.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And on the outside of the box it looked like panties.  Oh, disgusting. 
[02:40:00]  And it shows like a caricature of some guy eating the, the really nice lacy looking panties.  And then you open the box up and it's like a fruit roll up version of what a sumo wrestler  wears.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some fucking strip up the ass.  It's just a horrible, horrible triangle.  And it was before a girl shaved.  So you know it's just going to be picking hairs out of this fruit roll up.  It's like, remember they would melt before you even got, it got there.  It was just dumb to try.  Just start melting down by our hot pussy.  If I wasn't fucking 16 and full of fucking piss and vinegar, I never would have tried 
[02:40:30]  it, but anything was game back then.  Sure.  Horrible advertising.  You're right.  I don't care.  Didn't look like anything when you opened that fucking bowl.  But I do like a sandwich straight afterwards.  So no eating during, but right after.  No eating during sex, but afterwards just to have something on the side of the thing.  A little sandwich.  Like a little something pastrami type of, just a little bit of something on the side.  I got the Australian radio show.  We got that.  But also I want to ask Bill about the, I'm sure you've.  Just picturing you sitting there.  So you got any brothers or sisters? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just eating the sandwich afterwards.  This is delicious.  Bill, you had to see the drummer video, right?  Oh, the, the, the, uh.  It's more of a visual though.  Yeah, yeah.  But the only reason.  Oh, have you seen it yet?  Yeah.  The only reason I bring it up is because Bill, you know, he's.  Oh, it's fucking great.  He has a thing for drummers.  They say the drummer at the wrong gig?  There's a video out.  Where was it?  Like a, like a, it wasn't even a wedding gig.  Uh, I don't know what it is, but it was.  This guy is drumming his fucking ass off and I forgot the song. 
[02:41:30]  It just doesn't match.  Shark Crest Man.  Oh, it was Shark Crest Man.  Which is actually, you know, it's a decent song and everything, but it's a good thing.  It's, nobody in the, in the band is going nuts.  Right.  They're playing like.  Oh, no, no.  And this guy is playing like he's in Motley Crue in like 1986.  Are you kidding me?  Dude, they're playing.  Fucking awesome.  They're playing a very conservative version of Shark Crest Man, almost like, because there's  all the people in the, in the crowd.  It's also.  And this guy thinks he's on tour.  Pretty simple drum line too on that, on that song.  Oh, no, no, no, this guy does it.  You have no idea.  You gotta see it.  You know what? 
[02:42:00]  I'll send him my podcast.  I'm going to take you to where me and the fellas performed.  Well, all right, man, there was a, there was, it was a big 30 song.  They just made a lot of noise.  But anyway.  Just fast forward a little bit more.  This is my three.  No, no, before that.  Before that.  This next one, though, Texas Motor Speedway.  That's where we're taking you.  The heart of Texas.  The Lone Star State.  This is my three Texas boys done good.  Z, Z, Top.  A little summer feature.  I'm a freshman, Shark Draft Man. 
[02:42:30]  In Australia, they cook, Z, Z, Top.  I'm a hand from the state of West Virginia, Mr. Drafton.  The big team.  No, he has ears.  That's nothing.  That's not just laughing already.  And it's a.  Everyone else is just kind of going with it a little bit.  Looks like that dude from Full House, doesn't he?  Yeah.  All right, Dave Cooley arrow.  There you go, yeah.  He is really flipping his arms out.  Here he goes.  He turned like a Chris Foley.  Holy shit. 
[02:43:00]  He's completely spazzing out.  He's not being ironic or fucking around either.  He really means it.  But he really knows what he's doing.  Yeah, he's good.  Yeah, I haven't seen A.V. yet.  This is my favorite right here.  He's got a sharp, crisp, man.  He's just losing it.  They're losing it.  What's he doing?  He's like a serpent.  His arms are like snakes.  Now, those are all heavy metal.  That was that guy from Slaughter. 
[02:43:30]  That was one of his moves.  And he's spinning the one fucking stick every time he hits.  I mean, he really knows how to play.  He really knows how to play.  The guy.  The face.  The guy that was.  Look at that.  Look at that.  This guy rules.  This guy should be like playing Whitesnake music or some shit.  He's playing ZZ Top.  The second you see the double bass, you know, for a fucking double bass.  Yeah, yeah.  Before, you're like, all right, this guy's going to bring something.  He's wearing a yellow, like a yellow tuxedo jacket. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, they're awful like a lounge act.  With an American flag behind him.  Really bad.  Wow.  It's like those three guys in Shanana.  He stole their jackets.  Yeah.  Look at what he's doing.  Let me bring some sticks up.  I wish I could see what he's doing now.  Look at that.  Look at that.  This guy knows all the tricks.  Oh, he's doing like a robot move.  All the 80s fucking tricks.  They got another one, but he does this move called the cobra. 
[02:44:30]  Where he has his arm up like a 90 degree angle.  A cobra.  As he's playing with his left hand, and they just.  This guy's a douche.  He has that drummer complex where they hate being in the back and not like one of the stars.  There you go.  He's looking to get some attention.  Look at that.  He's windmilling.  He's talented windmilling with a drumstick.  Yeah.  Look at his stupid lounge jacket getting caught on his arm.  His friends must hate these videos.  The other videos you see, they actually get more involved in. 
[02:45:00]  But it's just, he's so fucking over the top compared to the rest of them.  This guy's like famous now.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's famous.  This guy's doing very well right now.  He did what he needed to do.  He made himself famous.  How's that can still fat?  Like he.  You know what I mean?  You do that for one hour a day.  You're a thin person.  Yeah.  You're right.  Oh, you got to switch it up, right?  Is that what they say?  You know, muscle confusion.  Same move.  He's got to play the bass every other day. 
[02:45:30]  That's the thing about drummers, right?  If you're a drummer and you're in a big famous band, like say something like U2 or whatever,  like a big band, you're just a lucky person, aren't you?  Really?  Sorry.  He's now taking his hands and going around the back of his neck with the sticks.  This is like Dice smoking.  Yeah, Dice used to take the cigarette and put it behind his head.  You know what it is?  He's probably bored out of his mind and said, fuck, I'll have fun with this song on my own.  No, this guy was back in the 80s.  He was in bands and did this shit and meant it. 
[02:46:00]  This guy hated grunge.  He fucking meant it.  When grunge came out, he hated it.  Oh, yeah.  He was fucking, there were chicks in spandex pants with fucking shirts with Japanese letters  on them coming up to him at clubs just going, you really play the drums?  Fantastic.  Yeah, that's right, baby.  Yeah, yeah, I'm fucking good.  What's he doing now, man?  And the guys are doing the guitar thing where they walk over and they both go up together  and then down together.  Yeah, the synchronized neck moving of the guitar, yeah.  These guys are hacks.  They really are.  Hacks. 
[02:46:30]  Dude, have you ever gone back?  I love this drummer.  And this band DJ intro guy.  Why the MC is awful.  What'd he say?  Is it like an MC or something?  Yeah, the MC is like something.  He's wearing the same outfit as the rest of them.  Yeah, why is he dressed like the band?  No, I think that was the singer.  No, no, no, no.  He was just off to the side.  No, the singer was one of the guitars?  Yeah, yeah.  No, he was like the MC, but he comes off like one of those bad fucking DJs.  But he's dressed just like the rest of them. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Hey, you want to do the Australian radio thing for Bill Burr?  No band looks good when they all choose an outfit.  I got to go pee-pees.  So do I.  We do have to go pee-pees before Iron Sheik.  I haven't made pee-pees in a while.  Yeah, I don't want to piss myself like the Iron Sheik.  I'm excited about meeting the Iron Sheik.  Yeah?  I've seen the picture of him in the room where he pissed himself off.  Yeah, that was gold.  One of the best fucking appearances ever by anyone.  Dude, the fucking.  Just sitting there peeing his pants.  He's just a grown man.  It's like I was talking. 
[02:47:30]  I'm not going to babble about it now.  Maybe today at 4 o'clock on my Raw Dog show.  Oh!  Nice.  Florentine's my co-host this week, and Otto is the guy I'm having on.  Very cool.  Do you have your own show now?  Otto and George.  Yes.  Excellent, man.  Yeah.  A little spin-off.  A little spin-off.  I know.  It's a spin-off show.  Joni meets Chachi.  Joni loves Chachi, my friend.  Have you ever heard the story about that?  I don't know if this is 100% true, but this is the legend story.  It's either Japan or China or one of those Asian countries, right? 
[02:48:00]  Joni loves Chachi.  The pilot episode is the highest rating show ever in that country for the first 10 minutes  because the word Chachi means cock.  Oh, so it's Joni loves cock.  Joni loves cock.  And everyone was going, I might check it out to see how much she loves the cock.  Yeah, it's on at four in the afternoon, you say.  Excellent.  It would do even better in Asia if it was Joni loves projectile diarrhea out of her ass into 
[02:48:30]  another gentleman's mouth.  In Japan?  Yes, of course.  Savages.  They love the shit video.  Joni loves her wedding veil shat upon.  They love a good rape porn, don't they, Joni?  If the girls aren't crying, they can't come.  They're terrible people.  Yeah, it's like their porn, they'll pixelate out the guy's cock.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  But they won't pixelate out the dog's cock.  Like, that would be, but we don't want to see a male's cock.  That would just be fucking weird.  They pixelate the pukes.  And all their porn starts with, like, a girl who's carefree, walking through the park. 
[02:49:00]  School girl dress.  And then there's just, like, a guy.  And then they're just getting, what?  Creepy.  Yeah, but that's it.  I know.  It is creepy.  I've done gigs out there, and just the constant, like, do you like, you know, you want to fuck  some, you like, like, come up and they go, do you like young boys?  Do you like young boys?  And then you go.  In Japan?  Yeah, and you're like, nah, nah, nah, I'm okay.  And as if you're trying to haggle with them.  Oh, Jesus.  And I'm like, no, I'm not a pedophile. 
[02:49:30]  And they're like, are you sure?  Are you sure?  Come on, you're on holiday.  You got me.  It's like over here when you get off the plane.  Taxi?  You need a taxi?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want to fuck a kid?  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's like they expect you to go, maybe, if the price is right.  You're going to barter.  I'm not a pedophile, but I am frugal.  Yeah, so if you got a good deal.  I'm always in for a good bargain.  That's hilarious.  I never fucked a kid, not because it's wrong, just because I never found the right price. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Listen, why don't we take that break?  We got the Iron Sheet coming in.  We got Bill Burr and Caroline's all weekend, starting tonight, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  And then you got Jim Jeffries at Vinny's Club down there in New Brunswick, New Jersey,  the Stress Factory, Thursday through Sunday down there.  Let's all take a hold of our cocks and drain them.  Our chachis.  Yes, our chachis.  We got Bill Burr in studio, playing Caroline's. 
[02:50:30]  And Jim Jeffries is, wow, he's all over the place.  You got the Stress Factory, Thursday through Sunday.  And then Wilbur Theater.  I just saw that you got a sold-out show up there in the end of the second show.  I just had a second show a couple of days ago, yeah.  So, everybody in the Boston area, let's go.  Second show, Jim Jeffries at the Wilbur Theater.  I don't know.  How do they get tickets? 
[02:51:00]  TheWilburTheater.com?  Yeah, Ticketmaster has got those ones.  Go see Jim if you're in the Boston area.  Very cool.  Oh, question for Bill Burr.  I like asking him all the sports questions in between visits.  The perfect game.  Oh, that?  Should they have given him the perfect game?  I don't know.  I don't know how that works.  I would have thought that they should have.  But I just love that umpire.  Jim Joyce.  I kicked the shit out of it.  I kicked the shit.  It was right there, and I kicked the shit out of it. 
[02:51:30]  I know.  It's like, is that what umpires say when you blow it?  I kicked the shit out of it.  Yeah, I kicked the shit out of it.  Biggest call of my career, and I kicked the shit out of it.  He's made that call thousands of times.  And the thing was, he wasn't even fucking close.  And then what was even worse, he pitches to the next.  He threw a perfect game, plus one batter.  Yeah.  And he, I mean, he's still got the no-hitter, but perfect game.  I mean, that's like a handful of guys, right?  That's why baseball sucks, because that fucking twat Bud Selig is more worried about, 
[02:52:00]  well, now other people will ask me.  Instead of just fucking being a man and saying, I'm making this decision, you fucking faggot.  He stinks.  Wasn't it something that, the picture I read in the paper, he had a kid the next day  or something, he had a child, like, two days later or something, and there was, the newspaper  was like, it doesn't matter, he's won the best prize of them all, right?  And I'm like, yeah, maybe he feels that way now, but in 18 years, that child's a bit of  a cunt, he'll be like, God, I wish I had that perfect game.  Dude, a homeless guy can have a kid.  Yeah.  Anybody can have a fucking kid. 
[02:52:30]  It's only, what, 21?  It's all perfect game.  Yeah, no, it's good.  Exactly, divorce has kids.  It shows you how easy that is.  He did it at 50.  It would have been a great story, it would have been great PR for Major League Baseball,  and people will say, well, if you do that, then you have to go back to the 1949.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  I know, you don't.  Exactly.  Just say, look, I'm doing this one time only, and I'm not paying attention to what happened  before this.  Yeah, but then you open a can of worms and shit, he just, you know, he fucked it.  He fucked it, so close it. 
[02:53:00]  Open a can of worms, dump one worm out, and fucking close the thing.  Fucking twiggy the printer.  Re-seal it.  Exactly.  The worm can is closed, motherfuckers.  Yeah, steroids didn't open up any can of worms, right?  Right.  Dude, I gotta be honest with you, I haven't been able to watch baseball since about June  of last year.  It just, uh...  They're done.  I was done.  Once Poppy came out, I was just like, ah, forget it.  All right.  It was all, it was a Hollywood fucking movie.  Are you guys looking forward to the World Cup?  Yeah, you know, like, uh...  And then you find out Stallone is, like, as tall as this table, and you're like, ah, I 
[02:53:30]  can't watch those movies anymore.  That's the reaction you should have got, Jim Jeffries.  Yeah, I...  I heard you.  I got my strange jersey on.  I'm very excited.  The World Cup.  I couldn't be more excited than this World Cup.  I'm like a fucking...  If I was a little kid, I'd be pulling on my testicles.  If they canceled soccer forever, nobody in this room would ever know it.  Isn't that...  It's a popular sport in the world.  It's a European thing.  Exactly.  And a South American thing.  Exactly.  But not an American thing.  Not real people like America. 
[02:54:00]  Do you know how bad, like, Beckham bombed out there in fucking L.A.?  They used to watch video of the guy sleeping in English.  Yeah, but the guy...  No, no, no.  But the thing was, Beckham was over the hill.  He was already fucked.  Oh, we wouldn't give a shit if he was in the prime of his fucking career.  Make an action movie.  We don't want you to run around and can't use your hands.  Have you...  Run around with your fucking hands in your pockets.  Have you heard that?  And every time someone kicks your shin, you act like you fell out of a car?  Just come on.  Run around with your fucking hands in your pockets. 
[02:54:30]  Are you fucking serious?  American football is the faggiest sport.  Oh, they drill.  You have to be a classic foreign torso.  Look at them.  You have the fucking seventh grade arms.  With your helmets.  They have the nerve to call us obese.  I went over to Europe.  You guys are a fucking mess.  You fucking meat pie sandwiches.  First of all, I'm Australian.  It's the same thing to us.  We don't care about your games or your geography.  No, I've got to admit, I watched rugby when I was in Ireland. 
[02:55:00]  That was the shit, dude.  That is just the most bone-crunching...  It's just guys 240 pounds.  Just running into piles.  Have you ever watched Aussie rules?  Like proper Aussie rules?  I've watched that, yeah.  Jimmy says Aussie rules all the time.  Hey?  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Nothing.  Aussie.  Aussie.  Australia rules football.  Aussie.  Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.  Oy, oy, oy.  Oy, oy, oy.  The cool thing about Aussie rules is it's only played in Australia,  and the only game that they have... 
[02:55:30]  Look how big our beer can is.  Is that a Simpsons episode?  We got so offended in Australia when that happened.  We didn't have a sense of humour about ourselves at all.  You guys don't even drink that shit, do you?  We don't drink Fosters, no.  It's just something we export overseas.  A 52-ounce, 16-ounce can.  You don't even drink that shit that you make?  No, you don't.  No one drinks Fosters.  We're Tuis and Forex and each state and town has their own beer.  So why are you fucking giving us your shitty beer?  Why?  Because we're selling fucking shit to... 
[02:56:00]  Selling goods.  That's what export's all about.  They're exporting.  We don't like this shit.  It's like the Mexicans don't drink Corona, do they?  Yeah, then you hype it up like it's awesome.  We'll sell to these assholes.  G'day, mate.  Yeah.  Soccer.  World Cup.  What do you think?  They sit down there eating bloomin' onions too?  It's a bloomin' onion.  Here in the Atbeck.  And they have a steakhouse in the Outback and they don't have to call it kind of like a  Philly cheesesteak.  Yeah, yeah.  And Philly, just go give me a cheesesteak. 
[02:56:30]  I'm going out to the steakhouse.  Yeah.  I don't like Philly cheesesteaks.  I like the taste of a Philly cheesesteak, but I don't like the idea of it.  I think they're great.  Oh, they're good.  But I'm just offended that Philadelphia think they're so fucking special that they're the  first people to put cheese with meat.  Since the dawn of time, someone's had cheese, someone's had meat, they fucking put them in  a sandwich.  You didn't invent anything.  It's not a recipe.  Philly loves it.  They took it as their own.  That's it.  Give me cheese and meat. 
[02:57:00]  Too wit, too wit out.  Okay.  Too wit.  Oh, God.  Right?  Yeah, too wit.  Too wit.  I like it.  Too wit out.  Too wit out.  What's not too like?  It's meat.  It's cheese.  What's the cheese, though?  Because isn't the cheese like processed cheese?  Yeah, it's a squirt to crap and everything.  It's not like fucking sliced cheese laying there.  It's horrible.  It's not a steak sandwich.  It's a fucking steak-em.  The cheese might be on the cheap side.  Okay.  It's a steak-em with cheese with, and then like four-em.  Four pounds of bread.  Yeah.  It's not like a steak sandwich.  I do like a good greasy Philly cheesesteak.  I love it, though. 
[02:57:30]  I don't even like them like Johnny Rockets or something like that.  Just fucking...  Johnny Rockets.  Even at fucking Subway.  It's meat, cheese, and bread.  Like, how can you go wrong?  You can't go wrong.  Yeah, you can't go wrong.  It's like a winning fucking combination.  Of course it is.  I got to be honest.  It's like you can go wrong.  There's like those fucking like Bennigans.  Remember that?  Where you would just go in there, and everything was just...  Like, how could you fuck this up?  Like, you'd have to try.  They could literally make a cheeseburger taste horrible.  You didn't like eating a bad burger and looking up and seeing a rowing oar for no reason? 
[02:58:00]  Fucking assholes.  Stop trying to be interesting.  Yeah, with your fucking theme.  Try to distract from their shitty food.  Oh, look.  It's a sneaker with a foot in it from Jaws.  Greatest.  I want to see that.  Fucking street signs.  You know what?  It's got a yield sign.  Got soccer fans checking in like crazy.  They have nothing to say.  But, but, but, but, but.  I'm not interested in that.  There's something about the United States, though, this guy wants to say.  And then we'll move on.  Let him say it to his fucking shotgun barrel.  Joel in Vegas.  Joel. 
[02:58:30]  Hey, I just heard on ESPN last night that more tickets were sold in the United States for  the World Cup than in any other country.  Is that possible?  That's because we let in too many illegals.  Yeah, that's because you call those Mexican immigrants.  That's what it is.  Wow.  Way to break it down.  You know what, though?  You're right.  Come on.  You're right.  I got to miss the show.  Nobody I know has bought tickets or is even talking about it.  No, the thing is, the thing is, because people buy them and they sell them, because when  I went to the World Cup with my dad, I was paying about well over a thousand pounds  a ticket or something. 
[02:59:00]  We don't know what that means.  Pounds.  I don't know.  How many stone is that?  It's like your money, but it's worth a lot more.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Okay.  Flimsy little faggy money that you've got.  All right.  Well, what does it mean so you can relate to the audience we have?  I think I've had this argument with you before.  You're right.  It's all the flimsy faggy money, especially the one with George Washington.  Remember the guy that kicked your ass?  It's all the...  Hang on.  Hang on.  Australia.  He's Australian.  But he lives in England.  We were the prisoners.  Now, I believe that.  He lives in England.  But the money here is... 
[02:59:30]  Everything's the same fucking size, and there's no way of touching it.  It's like you don't care for blind people.  Exactly.  I love when people come over here.  They come over here to make it here, and then they shit all over us.  Yeah.  Why are you shitting on us, Jim Jeffrey?  I like your weather.  You've left two countries.  Where are you playing?  The Melbourne fucking improv tonight?  No.  That's right.  You're a distressed fan.  You American people with your God.  Like, there's no racism.  Like, you guys didn't kick the shit out of those didgeridoo fucks over there. 
[03:00:00]  Give me a fucking drink.  Jesus Christ.  Don't you think if we had a God, we could have done that without guilt?  Like, killing Aboriginals was our first sport.  Name one fucking automobile that's a classic that you guys made.  An Australian classic.  The Monaro from Mad Max.  That's a good car.  Yeah, yeah.  That fucking, that was a good one.  I do like that one.  Yeah, all the fuel run out.  Last of the V8 Interceptors, eh?  He was still driving a fucking V8.  Last of the V8 Interceptors.  All right, you got me.  You got me.  Oh, okay.  In fact, all the vehicles from Mad Max. 
[03:00:30]  And they only fly around in fucking those gyrocopter things.  They would have had fucking Priuses.  Why, if all the petrol ran out, did they keep the V8?  Keep the V8.  It just doesn't seem like a reasonable plan.  Just walk away.  I'll talk to this humongous.  He seems like a reasonable man.  Have you ever seen, okay, Mad Max, because Mad Max 2, you guys called the road warrior.  Everybody else in the world called it Mad Max 2 because the first Mad Max film didn't  do that well over here.  So they thought, we'll make this one the first one.  So Mad Max 2 was your first Mad Max film.  But when the first Mad Max came out in America, you guys thought, oh, we'll never understand 
[03:01:00]  these Australian people.  So you dubbed American voices over the top of these Australians.  Like, come on.  That is so bad.  I know.  It looks bad.  It was that hard to understand.  It was Mel Gibson for fuck's sake.  They killed my wife and child.  What?  Are there undubbed versions now available?  Oh, no.  This American, this Australian heat is getting to me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I bought the video cassettes and there was the American version. 
[03:01:30]  But you can get the originals now.  You can get the original one.  You can get the original.  Yeah, of course.  You can get the originals now.  But it'll sound like this.  Yeah.  Oh, you can't kill me, man.  That fucking guy.  Was Yahoo serious in that one?  No.  Wow.  Yahoo serious.  That was Young Einstein.  I watched that the other day on Netflix.  That movie's horrible.  It doesn't date that well.  Isn't he dead?  No, no.  He's still kicking around.  Are you kidding?  He tried to sue Yahoo the site because he thought he owned the fucking word. 
[03:02:00]  He was 10 years before Yahoo came along and made him look like a cunt.  Fucking our other big celebrity, Google Wayne.  Google Wayne.  What's the worst showbiz name?  Yahoo serious or Whoopi Goldberg?  That's kind of a Whoopi Goldberg.  Yeah, Whoopi Goldberg.  Those are two ones.  You know, Whoopi Goldberg the other day was because Harry Connick Jr. got really upset  when he was on Australian TV and there was like an act thing.  Oh, a race thing going on.  Yeah, and some Australian people blacked up, as we call it in Australia. 
[03:02:30]  We call it blacking up.  Blacked up.  Yeah, because they blacked up.  That's the black face.  Yeah, we call it blacking up.  They were imitating the Jackson 5.  Yeah, we call it blacking up because the joke is, my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend actually  said this.  She goes, I once came home and I went, sometimes when I get drunk, I black out and I don't  know what I've done.  She goes, well, better than blacking up and not knowing what you've done.  That's the way Connick was judging, right?  That's right.  Harry Connick Jr. was judging it. 
[03:03:00]  And then, so they come back to The View and all the ladies in the view are going, well,  he's completely right to be upset and to walk off the set and everything like that.  So, let us not forget that when she was dating Ted Danson, he blacked up at one of her things  and all of a sudden she's mightier than thou.  She's got herself right.  They brought that up.  We brought it up once and she hung up on us.  Yeah, we went after her over that one.  Over the Irish thing.  We got Jay Moore joining the conversation.  Jay Moore.  Holy shit, we got a lot going on today.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore. 
[03:03:30]  Jay Moore.  You leave Whoopi Goldberg alone, okay?  Sorry, Jay Moore.  Sorry, Jay Moore.  Is that Jim Jeffries?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  And Bill Burr in the studio today, too.  Billy there?  Yes, I am.  Hello, Jay Moore.  Got a full house today.  So, Bill Burr and I did April Foolishness for K-Rock together and we were kind of hanging  out in the same dressing room for, I would say, the better part of about 40, 45 minutes.  And it was kind of interesting, at one point I said to Bill Burr, you can relax, I'm not 
[03:04:00]  going to say anything to make fun of you, that's the old guy.  You seemed to be like on your toes, waiting for me to smash you.  I was like, hey, good to see you.  And you were like, okay.  Really?  Who was I?  Yeah.  Is this Jay Moore the comedian?  Yeah.  Is this the same Jay?  Oh, fuck, I thought there was just some cunt ringing in.  You were right twice.  And then he's telling Bill off.  I'm like, who the hell does this bloke think he is?  Not only am I the comedian Jim Jeffries, but I'm the promoter because I'm on Amazon right 
[03:04:30]  now looking at Hellbound Live at the Comedy Store in London and now the owner of Bridge  version.  The Audible Audio Edition is ready to go for anybody who wants to buy Jim Jeffries CD and  DVD.  I suggest they get after it.  Ah, there you go.  Very good.  Look at him.  Thank you for that.  Plugging your wares.  There's another $10 in my backpack.  Five pounds.  When you type in Jim Jeffries on Amazon, it says the ultimate tough guy, the life and times 
[03:05:00]  of James J. Jeffries.  He was Gentleman Jim.  He got beaten by, he was the racist bloke who got beaten by the first black heavyweight  or whatever.  Oh, wow.  I must have really.  Gentleman Jim, he lost to Ted Spook.  That must have been awkward.  Henry got blacked up.  Blacked up.  I think I've started something here.  If everyone can start saying that, you'll all feel a lot better.  Blacken up.  Because we just call it blackface.  Yeah, that's not it because.  Or minstrel show.  Yeah, but that's not even effort.  That's just your face.  That's not arms and legs and, you know, real effort. 
[03:05:30]  Mammy, mammy, how I love you.  How I love you.  That whole thing.  Al Jolson getting down there singing Mammy.  Isn't that amazing how you could get famous back in the day?  Like, if you could do, like, bird whistles, you could get on, like, the Ed Sullivan show.  That's amazing.  He sounds like a robin.  They were desperate for entertainment.  Yeah, anything.  He could fucking.  What are you up to there, Moors?  Well, right now I'm making pound cake for my son who's going to get on a school bus in about a half hour.  What are you doing, commercial?  Making pound cake? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  He likes pound cake.  He likes pound cake.  I read that in your book.  He likes the pound cake.  But you make it or are you just cutting it up with serely?  My wife defrosts it and puts it in the toaster.  She makes it idiot proof.  I was going to say.  In the toaster when I wake up, the butter has been sitting out overnight, so it's easy to spread.  And there's cinnamon sugar.  She puts everything out like so.  How disgusting are people that leave butter out when they have a cat, and then you just  see this big divot of fucking cat lickings in the butter, and they use it, and they still 
[03:06:30]  use it?  It's just like this rough cat tongue thing's been added all night.  Cats love butter.  Oh, they certainly do.  It sure kisses me on the face anyways.  What's the difference?  It's okay.  Kisses.  Give me kisses.  Oh, a little butter breath.  I used to have a cat when I was growing up that used to always end up on with a pillow  next to my head, right?  You're an asshole right next to your face.  Yeah, but I used to wake up to it fucking licking my head like it's grooming me.  It's probably like that bald patch at the front, right?  Because it was the same section.  But I got so addicted to that tongue fucking going over my scalp that I'd wake up and 
[03:07:00]  just be like, I was in heaven.  I've had many a wank to a cat licking my head.  You want to know a very odd fact about Jim Jeffery's cat?  Also afraid of bananas.  Oh, shit.  You guys are the ones who broadcast that to the fucking planet.  We left it alone, though.  You left it alone.  Some bitch in fucking Denver, good morning, Denver, thinks he's hysterical and brings 
[03:07:30]  out a banana.  And I just walked off set.  And she's just like, I just walked off set.  Fuck good morning, Denver.  Never have another good morning, Denver.  Fuck you.  It is incredible when you do stand-up how they're like, you know, you do seven radio stations  and they're all in the same building.  And you got to go across town and do the urban station.  Like, yeah, they're coming out.  I don't do them.  I say, no, I turn them down.  I love the Mexican stations where it's just a bloke with a cowbell and a ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding. 
[03:08:00]  And you're like, is this a fucking show?  Wow, he's all dressed up today.  Jay Moore, we got the Iron Sheik in studio now as well.  The Iron Sheik.  Is he still champion?  He is the champion.  Number one country in the world.  Is he really there?  Yeah.  He's won a gold medal.  How are you, Iron Sheik?  I'm not too fast.  How are you?  No.  Hey, Iron Sheik, can you hear me?  No, he doesn't have headphones on because he's got all that Arab shit on. 
[03:08:30]  I'm going to tell him something very important.  We got to put your headset on, baby.  You got to put the headset on over the table.  This is Jay Moore, Iron Sheik.  Can you hear now?  Someone say something.  Yeah.  Hi, Iron Sheik.  Can you hear him?  Can you hear him?  What's up, Sammy?  Yeah, okay.  Are you there?  Can you hear me right now?  Okay.  Right.  USA, number one.  Iron Sheik, can you hear me?  Yeah.  You listen to me good.  You're a no-good son-of-a-bitch, piece-of-shit, motherfucker.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  You're a piece-of-shit yourself.  You can come suck my ten-fucking-inch cock. 
[03:09:00]  Fuck you.  You're a piece-of-shit garbage.  Come here.  I'll put in the camel clutch.  I'll fuck your ass.  I'll make you humble.  I know you'll do it in my butt, because that's the only way you can get it.  Yeah, fuck you, piece-of-shit.  Yeah, come on, man.  I'm right outside.  Come on, motherfucker.  I'm here, too.  Wake up, stupid.  You sound like a moron.  Fuck you.  I don't want to fucking do that every year.  He's just...  He's just...  He's just...  He's just turned his earphones off.  Let's just cut with the... 
[03:09:30]  Trying to rile him up, okay?  We don't want to do that to...  Wait, what happened?  What happened to him?  He threw his headphones.  He doesn't want to...  We're trying to change his life around a little bit.  All right, Jay.  We'll talk to his...  Thanks, Jay.  You fuck.  Iron Sheik.  Hey!  Iron Sheik!  Get back here!  Iron Sheik!  Hey, get back here!  Iron Sheik, it's okay.  We didn't want to do it this way.  Iron Sheik.  Somebody call it the guy for another phone.  What happened?  I understand.  We're trying to change things.  He was a guy.  We're trying to change things around here.  We'll say sorry. 
[03:10:00]  Bring him back in.  Yeah, bring him back in.  We'll apologize.  We'll apologize.  Calm him down.  Yeah, tell him bring him back in and apologize.  I apologize for doing this.  And no more crazy phone calls here.  This is bullshit.  Oh, my God.  It's the O.P. and Anthony shit.  I understand that, but we're supposed to...  I know what the act is, but it's changing.  We're supposed to know that things changed?  Tell him it was a phone call!  I didn't know he made a baby face turn.  I told him everything.  I didn't know he made a baby face turn.  Yeah, listen to me.  You don't go in right away for the kill.  Wait, he's walking down the hall.  What happened?  What happened, Iraq? 
[03:10:30]  Why weren't we informed that the Iron Sheik had changed?  What happened?  I wasn't informed of that either.  Who did you tell?  Bill Burr at Caroline's.  Sam!  Bill Burr at Caroline's.  Sam?  Well, why didn't Sam tell us?  Two shows tonight, Bill Burr.  I told us, Sam.  No more craziness.  You're trying to sell that late one.  You want to change things around here?  Change and then I still act like a cunt.  You know, you can't change overnight.  We didn't know Jay Moore was going to do that on the phone.  We had no idea.  Jay Moore said he wanted to talk to him?  Jay Moore was on the phone already.  I understand.  I understand.  Kenny's got a report.  What's going on?  He's ready? 
[03:11:00]  Sheik wants you.  Okay.  I got to go.  Thank you, guys.  I'm sorry it didn't work out this time.  What are you talking about?  Bring him the fuck back.  Yeah, let me walk on him.  Yeah, walk on him.  Let me walk on him.  Don't.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Iron Sheik's a bit fucking precious.  Iron Sheik is a cunt.  What is he fucking doing?  Fuck him, man.  Fuck that old cocksucker.  He sat down.  He came in to do an interview.  Hold on.  He might be quitting drinking or something.  Wrestling.  Who cares?  Let's see how long he's off. 
[03:11:30]  He might be quitting drinking or something.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Quit drinking.  He was a lot more fun when he was drinking.  Call him a cocksucker before 10 in the morning.  Fuck him.  Get him a drink, motherfucker.  Let's see what happened.  How about we say fuck Jay Moore?  I love Sutter Kenny.  What did you hear?  I love Jay.  No, I don't mean to know.  How did Jay Moore?  I never met Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  He was reading me on Wikipedia, wasn't he?  I think so.  No, he was just kidding.  Jay Moore was just trying to do a work with him.  No, Jay knew exactly what he was doing. 
[03:12:00]  He decided to fucking start a fire for us to try to put down.  I didn't know the Iron Sheik's character has changed.  What, Kenny?  What's up, Kenny?  Did you ever notice that ever since you made him piss his pants, he brings a bodyguard with him?  Yeah.  So?  What's that going to do?  Yeah, what's that going to do?  What's that going to do?  Yeah, what's that going to do?  Yeah, he's done.  I think 30 years of wrestling made him piss his pants.  He left the building?  Oh, fuck him then.  Like, he got up early and everything.  What happened?  He said he was sick to begin with and he wanted to pass and then they talked him into coming 
[03:12:30]  for a few minutes.  I didn't know if he wanted to pass.  Shut his voice down a little weak.  Come on, guys.  Come on, guys.  Come on, I'm going to fuck you, son of a bitch.  How about a little empathy?  Empathy.  Fuck him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck him and his goddamn fucking made it.  I don't sign off on.  That's the Iron Sheik.  Come on, man.  Hours of entertainment.  How many Saturdays did he fill up?  Don't, don't, don't.  None for me.  This is the thing, this is the thing, right, the Iron Sheik doesn't want alcohol, so I've  just been offered the Iron Sheik's alcohol because you want someone fucked up in the room. 
[03:13:00]  Nah.  Yeah.  And now he's got his goddamn Yasa Arafat fucking headgear on.  I'll have it, though.  We didn't videotape that.  It's part of the culture.  Where's Sam?  Good for you.  What are we doing?  Where's Sam that, uh, that, uh, we didn't know that he had changed his act or something.  But how do you not have that taped?  Well, I, oh, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be taped.  You know what happened?  And it did happen so fast.  I know, I know.  But, but, yeah.  You typed it in there.  No one expected that to go down.  What happened, Sam?  Could you grab a mic and explain why?  Explain what the fuck's going on.  We were not told that Mr. Sheik, uh, has changed to some kind of baby face now. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  And, uh, he doesn't like that confrontation that was fine with him the last, every time  he was in here.  Well, uh, apparently his gimmick has changed as of today.  What's his gimmick now?  As of today.  Right.  This is, again, this is not like, what's his gimmick?  Now he would like to be positive.  So why didn't he just say that instead of, uh, leaving like a baby?  Instead of saying, oh, fuck your ass and make you humble?  That we didn't even know that guy? 
[03:14:00]  Pardon.  Jesus.  Yeah, they, I also think his manager's dragging him around to places he doesn't want to go  to anymore.  His manager was a bit of a top, though, wasn't he?  Well, his manager's doing, you know.  His manager's a cuckold.  Who, the colonel?  He needs to, he needs to, yeah, the colonel.  He needs to embed his head under the screen.  He's going to make Iron Sheik cuckoo clocks the second he dies.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  But this was all.  The old belt looked a bit plastic-y, didn't it?  It looked like we had won that in a competition.  Are we going to get him back?  No.  Today?  That's really it?  He's gone.  They can't even calm him down enough to bring him back? 
[03:14:30]  He's gone.  His manager was trying to get him to come back.  He wouldn't come back.  Fuck him, man.  What's he going to do?  He's going to hear more and just go, I was champion of world, best, greatest city to run  in, come to Madison Square Garden, fought back in 1980, fought Hulk Hogan.  He not the best.  I bet.  Fuck, shut up.  Who cares?  We heard it 80 times.  Sheik could go fucking herself with his curly shoes.  Did you walk out with him?  Yeah.  What were they saying?  What was he saying? 
[03:15:00]  He was saying, I don't want to do that bullshit.  Oh, he wanted to do it last time?  Yeah, that's right.  Then why don't you just tell him it was a phone call?  Yeah, and then he pictures him pissing his pants on the internet.  Fuck him.  I don't want to talk about it.  He's probably not trying to go positive this time.  I don't want to apologize either.  How is being positive an angle?  Yeah, I know.  Who wants to hear that?  Stay in school.  Eat your vegetables.  You know what?  The good people of Kansas.  A chicomaniac.  I mean, it'd be one thing if they'd called in advance and said, look, we want to come 
[03:15:30]  on and this is what we want to do.  Greatest Iranian hero.  Greatest.  I'm a chicomaniac.  Eat your vegetables and stay in school, kids.  What does he think he's going to be?  What is he doing?  He's the Iron Sheik.  He's supposed to be hated here.  He's from Iran.  We hate Iran.  Fuck him.  His whole angle is to be a fucking nasty fucking camel jockey guy that Sergeant Slaughter  punched. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  Fuck him.  Change his act to what?  I don't know.  I'm helping clean pelicans down in the Gulf.  I'm cleaning them up.  I'm going to volunteer to help African AIDS.  What is he doing?  He's a fucking cop.  Fuck him.  He's going to be a...  Back in the lamp.  Back in the lamp, fucker.  Are they coming back to a teacher from Tennessee?  It's wrestling.  Yeah, true. 
[03:16:30]  It's still real to me.  What the fuck?  What about that manager of his?  He's a worm, too.  Who fucking cares about that fat worm?  Yeah, and he was...  I like how Jay just bailed, though.  And then Jay shook up the bees and then let him out of the jar and left the room.  All right, yeah.  I'm off to my pound cake.  Yeah, right.  You know he's lamping his ass off right now.  It caused a big shit.  Ha ha, Jay.  Jay Bullets.  While the Sheik was saying, let's go.  I don't want to do this. 
[03:17:00]  Let's go.  Let's go.  He was saying, you know, hey, we're trying to do something different.  Come on.  Come on.  And then once the Sheik was out of earshot, he just kept going, Sam, I'm sorry.  Believe me, I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I'm sorry, Sam.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  He was able to pull his head out of the Sheik's fucking arm like a tick long enough.  He's going to bring fucking Emanuel Stewart in here tomorrow.  How about enough with the temperamental iron Sheik?  Yeah.  He gives a shit.  The last person.  You know what he does?  His whole thing is to sign photos for guys with mullets. 
[03:17:30]  Nobody gives a shit about him anymore.  I tell you what, he did look cute, though, with the earphones over the tablecloth.  Yes.  That was good.  That was something you don't see very often.  That's something he wasn't wearing last time was the Yasa Arafat thing on his head.  Right.  And now I guess that made him serious.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Like, no more fucking around.  Like, he can't have Jay Moore fucking have a little mic work.  Is that a religious thing, that headgear?  Is that a religious thing, or is that just, like, keep the sand out of your head?  Just to wipe fucking body parts off of you after you fucking lob a bomb into a bus. 
[03:18:00]  Jesus Christ.  Fucking savage.  Yeah, yeah.  Enough.  Sick of him.  Tired of him.  The headdress is more of a bad guy.  And I'm mean to the Jews, am I?  Look, I'm with the Jews on this one.  I don't like that whole thing.  They're trying to build another mosque in Staten Island.  Boy, did they get an earful last night.  There was a meeting, a public meeting.  Yeah, they had the footage of the bloke saying he liked Hamas.  He liked Hamas and fucking shit.  Who said that?  Some guy wants to build a mosque in Staten Island.  Staten Island's like, go fuck your mother. 
[03:18:30]  Good, they're not going to let him?  Well, you know, they probably will.  Same thing that happened down at Ground Zero.  Fucking block away.  Did they build a mosque there?  They approved the whole thing.  They're going to build a big mosque so everybody can live all cushy and comfy together.  How about you pray at the fucking place where a couple thousand people died?  Or how about once...  Because of your stupid religion.  Muslims, instead of saying, why do you have to be sensitive to all Muslims, how about  once Muslims think sensitively towards the victims of people doing shit in the name  of their religion?  How about once you hear that from Islam? 
[03:19:00]  Just circumcising women and fucking not letting women...  Well, that's fine.  All right, there are good parts to the bad part.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to give women pleasure?  Stop.  Those clits really are pesky.  Oh, they are.  And if they want to keep them, you're buried up to your neck and will stone your face.  But isn't that wonderful?  Well, circumcising women, the whole idea is that a woman shouldn't enjoy sex.  Yeah!  Like, you know what I kind of like about that?  It's like, it would take all the effort out, wouldn't it?  Yes!  If you just knew there's no result ever... 
[03:19:30]  Hey, Jim is digging it.  Yeah, if there's no result ever, that it's all just about me, I'm not even going to feel  guilty about not being tender.  Takes it out of it, yeah.  Her vagina is nothing more than an oiled catcher's mitt.  You just stick your dick in it, finish, and she jumps up and down until it's empty.  When they take the clit off, there'd be stitches and stuff, wouldn't they?  I would think in a civilized country there would be.  It's a wax.  They'd probably just put mealworms and fucking leeches on it or some shit.  Would you keep it in a jar? 
[03:20:00]  Bill, I'm just saying this because I love Bill's reaction.  He puts his head in his hands and just goes like, oh, this fucking asshole Anthony.  Are you getting ants to fucking bite the wounds?  No, I'm just doing that because when they show this clip on some other program later,  I'll actually look like I'm concerned.  Oh, okay.  It's that guy.  You know what?  I don't like the idea.  I wanted to say something, but instead I sat here and drew pictures.  Do you know that my brother is going into government in Australia? 
[03:20:30]  He's running for government in Australia, right?  What do you do then?  He wants to be a politician, right?  Dingo ate my baby.  And having his younger brother be old cunt boy who talks about rape on the radio with  youth dickheads, he feels like it's hurting his career a bit.  Look, Jimmy Carter became president.  He got a drunk for a brother.  That's right.  So did Bill Clinton.  Bill Clinton had a drug addict.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The drug addict fucking coke dad.  Fucking Joe Pooley got into you.  He's got a drunk for a brother.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:21:00]  Not like he's running for office, Jimmy.  Hey, do we take a picture of my bald?  Fucking insulting.  Fucking bald.  Is my friend erection after the clip?  Nah, that's what it is.  Both my nuts are over to one side.  Yeah.  I'm going to push him over.  I'm wearing tight Armani jeans.  I know.  They're like Lemmy.  Robert Plant's song remains the same.  Fucking junk right in your face.  There's a lady.  I can't believe the fucking Iron Sheik's not coming back. 
[03:21:30]  I'm in shock.  I'm so shocked.  He urinated his slacks the last time he was in.  It was all over the fucking internet.  He's been on.  When he sobered up, do you think he was proud of that?  Yeah.  I got a picture signed.  Putting that cold championship belt up against his head to soothe the hangover.  Yeah.  What did I do?  I'm going to go in there and I'm going to show that I actually.  People are saying.  There's another side to the Iron Sheik.  Actually, Nick has info on the Iron Sheik.  I guess he's cleaning up his life or something.  Nick, what do you know on the Iron Sheik?  We're really confused by this.  I'm a little disappointed in the way you guys handled this interview here. 
[03:22:00]  Iron Sheik is a legend and should not be treated in the way the old.  All right.  Enough of the shit.  Thank you.  What do you know on Iron Sheik?  Thank you.  He's a legend.  It's still real to me, damn it.  Yeah.  That's funny.  What do you know about his meds?  No.  Supposedly on this other horrible show that he was on earlier this morning, they were talking  about how he's on a lot of medication and that his wife is ordering him to take in order  to still stay in the house.  And it's calming him the fuck down. 
[03:22:30]  And that's the whole thing.  He's not putting himself in any sort of situation.  I am on this all off so I do not kill y'all.  Wait.  So he's a mellow Iron Sheik.  We didn't know that.  No.  We explained it was a phone call.  But he wasn't mellow.  He got upset pretty quickly.  He's trying to become a different person because his wife won't bang him unless he cleans up  his arm.  At the beginning when he's like, fucking suck you, suck my big 10-inch dick, you fucking  fuck face.  Like that.  Where I thought, oh, he's having fun.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  It was like mic work.  They do.  Like back and forth.  The wrestlers.  They go, I know.  And I'll see you at Madison Square Garden on July 21st when I'm going to come in. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what that was at.  Rumble by the beach.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of those fucking things.  But no.  Iron Sheik was mad.  I'm not fighting you here.  I thought you had pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  God.  That was just like fucking weird.  Should have brought Mr. Fuji in.  I think he's coming.  I bet he's coming off.  Ah.  Throwing dust in his eyes.  Whatever happened to Mr. Fuji?  Mr. Fuji.  He's up on charges.  You wouldn't.  No.  You wouldn't even need the original Mr. Fuji.  He's just a fat Asian in a hat.  He's got up. 
[03:23:30]  But the good news is he does have a fight coming up next week.  He'll be fighting lithium.  Ha ha.  All right.  Punch him out.  Here we go.  He's on Twitter.  Yeah.  No.  See.  Someone does this.  I ain't buying into this shit.  I asked the fucking manager who does this Twitter.  Because it's pretty funny.  The Iron Sheik has a Twitter.  And the latest tweet is,  Jmore37, you put me over on the radio.  I am the legend.  Today I just chill out.  But I am the real champion.  Not that cocksucker Bubba. 
[03:24:00]  Bubba.  What?  He didn't write that.  No.  He doesn't write his own fucking tweets.  What do you mean?  That's not him?  I would think that is a PR person.  It says the Iron Sheik right there.  Come on, guys.  No.  I asked the guy.  I think that's somebody trying to.  I actually follow the Iron Sheik on Twitter.  So I asked his manager who's writing that shit.  It's really funny.  And he said a couple guys in Boston or something.  So they heard that.  And we're like, uh-oh.  Now we got to do some damage control.  Oh, you put me over.  Yeah.  Like I did that.  It was part of the act leaving the studio.  Yeah.  Who's Bubba?  I don't know.  It's some fucking hillbilly that thinks he's good. 
[03:24:30]  What other wrestlers do you get?  Do you ever get the Bushwhacker guys from New Zealand?  We had one.  I've seen them.  We had one of the guys in here.  The Bushwhackers.  We had a Bushwhacker.  But now if they came in, we'd have to treat them very nicely and not call them Bushwhackers.  You ever have the Moondogs on here?  Do you remember them?  No.  Moondog 1, 2, and 3.  They come in chewing on those dog bones.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember that either.  You don't remember the...  I'm sure.  I'm sure there's a...  I believe you.  Google Images. 
[03:25:00]  Do they wrestle with Hulk and all those guys?  They were only around for a minute.  They were a triple team.  Jesus Christ.  Was it WWF?  Nobody?  I really don't remember.  Is George Animal Steel still around?  He was my favorite.  The one that used to eat the corner pads.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was the guy who was actually a substitute teacher out of Detroit.  Yeah.  Oh, he had Detroit?  Yeah, something like that.  From parts unknown.  Unknown.  And he would eat the turnbuckle.  He was like a gorilla that they shaved type of thing, wasn't he? 
[03:25:30]  He was Harry.  Should we break and regroup?  What are we doing?  I got to whiz again.  All right.  Let's get some plugs in.  You got Bill Burr tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday at Caroline's.  Two shows tonight, right, Bill?  Two shows tonight.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100 for Bill Burr at Caroline's.  Jim Jeffries is all over the fucking place because he's not in America a lot or something.  I'm in America a lot.  Stress Factory this weekend.  Stress Factory this weekend.  Wilbur Theatre coming up what?  Next weekend.  I'm doing Minnesota, Philadelphia, and Boston Thursday, Friday, Saturday, next week. 
[03:26:00]  What's Dresden?  Are we firebombed on it?  Firebomb Germany.  Incendiary bombs on civilians.  Yet another war crime.  We got a lot of them.  We got a lot of them.  Oh, don't be so guilty, Bill.  They deserve it.  No, no.  I'm not guilty.  No?  But I just, you know, didn't I bring up their Aborigine bullshit?  Yeah, you did.  I've come to the point where I just feel everybody's completely full of shit.  That's kind of where I'm at.  Australians are quite open about killing of Aboriginals. 
[03:26:30]  You know, Tasmania, that little bit at the bottom, the little bit at the bottom of Australia.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Was that the part where you guys get on your boogie boards when you're out there?  Yeah.  There's not one Aboriginal left on that island.  They got all of them.  Got all of them.  They got fucking...  Makes it sound like a good thing.  Like, yeah, we got them all.  They got all of them.  That's fucking quite an effort.  Like, that's...  You have to really search them out.  When you have mold in your house and they've got to put that tarp over.  Yeah.  And smoke everything out.  So they did to the island.  Like, one of them lived to be quite old, but then when she died, it was on the news, 
[03:27:00]  like, well, that's them all done.  It's no more left.  And none of them have traveled down there as tourists to live.  Why would you?  You know you're not wanted since they got rid of every single one of them.  We got the answer to your moondog question, Bill Burr.  Tell Bill Burr I saw the moondogs at Malden High School in Massachusetts in the gym.  They wrestled for $5 in the mid-90s.  Oh, in the mid-90s.  I know.  I saw them in the late heyday, the late 70s.  Yeah, $5 you could get a ticket to watch the moondogs back in the 90s. 
[03:27:30]  They performed at a food court at the South Shore Plaza in Braintree.  I waited too long on British Petroleum.  I knew it.  It went up today?  Yeah.  I was waiting for a fucking nice dip.  It happened.  I was going to jump in, and it's up like 10% today.  Fuck.  I was going to buy that shit.  What?  BP.  Because it went down so far.  Oh, yeah.  How much is it a share?  It's a bargain.  It's still a bargain.  It's like fucking now it's got to be about 30-something bucks.  It just went up 10% today. 
[03:28:00]  Dude, it was at over 60-something a share, and now it was down to 29, 30.  It seems like a lot of effort, this stock market.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Oh, you Brits.  You Brits.  I'm always going to call them a Brits.  The pick of the day is for stock, at least.  I don't know if it's BP, because I didn't realize that was going to go up.  Yeah.  But they're saying that there's a raw dog stock, which will go on sale at 4 o'clock today.  Boo.  Jim.  Boo.  What's raw dog? 
[03:28:30]  Florentine will be my co-host.  Otto will be my guest.  Boo for the plug.  Don't call me a disaster vulture.  I just see opportunity for buying, and I buy, and then I sell.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go take leaks.  We'll finish the show next.  You're a fancy wardrobe.  Yeah.  Exactly.  My musk stock is going down in Stanton Island or whatever it is.  We'll break.  We'll finish up next.  Stay there.  But first this.  Over here first, Travis.  The boys made this.  Fight the boner.  Boner. 
[03:29:00]  Fight the boner.  Fight the boner.  Fight the boner.  Fight the boner.  Boner.  Fight the boner.  Fight the boner.  Boner.  Fight the boner.  Fight the boner.  Boner.  Boner.  Boner.  All right.  Crazy day. 
[03:29:30]  Bill Burr.  Jim Jefferies in the studio.  Travis has got the Iron Sheik thing.  Oh, yeah.  Because that was very confusing.  We had no fucking idea that was going to happen today.  Jay Moore is on the phone.  Wants to talk to the Iron Sheik.  I'm thinking Jay Moore might be a big time fucking wrestling fan.  A Sheik fan?  Like an old school wrestling fan.  I thought they were doing a bit.  Yeah.  And Jay Moore, just like our Taylor Hicks interview, decided to blow it up right in front of our  eyes.  And we didn't see it coming in.  Didn't see it coming.  He started a fire and then said, well, have fun putting out the fire, boys. 
[03:30:00]  That really was a thing of beauty.  He got it right to the point.  Jay Moore's part was beautiful.  He played it perfectly.  But just in case you missed it, we're going to play the Iron Sheik thing.  And then Sam just gave me audio.  He actually talked to the Iron Sheik as he was leaving the building.  Oh.  So let's start with how it all went down about a half hour ago.  Sam.  Hi, Iron Sheik.  Can you hear me?  Watch out, Sammy.  Yeah, I can.  Are you there?  Can you hear me right now?  Right.  USA, number one.  Iron Sheik, can you hear me? 
[03:30:30]  I can.  Yes, yes.  You listen to me good.  You're a no good son of a bitch, piece of shit motherfucker.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  You're a piece of shit yourself.  You can come suck my 10th fucking inch cock.  Fuck you.  You're a piece of shit garbage.  Come here.  I'll put in the camel clutch.  I'll fuck your ass.  I'll make you humble.  I know you'll do it in my butt because that's the only way you can get it.  Yeah, fuck you, piece of shit.  Yeah, come on, man.  I'm right outside.  Come on, motherfucker. 
[03:31:00]  I'm here too.  Wake up, stupid.  You sound like a moron.  I don't want to fucking dance every year.  He's just, he's just, he's just, he's just turned his ear cones off.  Let's, let's, let's just cut with the, trying to rile him up, okay?  We don't want to do that to, to the guy.  Wait, what happened?  What happened to Iron Sheik?  He threw his headphones.  He doesn't want to, he, we're trying to change his life around a little bit.  Thanks, Jay.  We'll talk to his, thanks, Jay.  Hey, hey, Iron Sheik, get back here.  Iron Sheik.  Hey, get back here. 
[03:31:30]  Iron Sheik, it's okay.  We didn't want to do it this way.  Sheik, we were, hey, it's a legend.  What happened?  I understand.  We're trying to change things.  He was a guy with a friend.  We're trying to change things around here.  We'll say, we'll say sorry.  And that's when he walked out.  When you listen to it back, Jay was slightly aggressive with him.  Like, at the time, it felt all friendly.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you don't have the visuals, if you're just listening to it.  It's like, listen, you son of a, he's like, wow, yeah, that's really nasty.  With friends like that, who needs enemies?  I like the bit where he goes, I'm going to fuck you in the ass and make you humble. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, that's so, it's like nice and aggressive.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's a life lesson in there.  Yeah, yeah.  And none of us knew that he wanted to do it a different way today, which makes that even  better.  Yeah, oh, no.  That Jay went right at him, right out of the box.  He told that.  Oh, hold on, sorry.  While we were walking here, while you guys were on the air, we were walking up the hall. 
[03:32:30]  And that's when he said, the Iron Sheik's not feeling well today, and he wants to be  more positive.  I don't think the Iron Sheik's got many years left.  Could you hear him wheezing when he was fighting back?  Yeah, he was.  He was out of breath.  He hasn't been on the best of health.  He's going for ankle surgery, I think, next week.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  So what?  They don't come back from that.  You talked to him as he was leaving, right?  I mean, kind of. 
[03:33:00]  I pretty much just left the recorder on, but yeah.  All right, let's see if I'm going into mosques and not knowing how to choose.  Tell that fucking piece of shit of my manager.  I'm not on the test.  What's his cane you can hear?  You can hear the cane, okay.  That was his cane tapping, right.  Now we go back, because now you can really appreciate that.  That's the cane noise.  What happened?  They bothered you?  Yeah, man.  I'm not feeling good today.  Tell him this girl, man. 
[03:33:30]  All right, I'm going to get him.  You got a big fever?  Yeah, tell him this girl.  Fuck him.  This fucking jabroni want to get involved with that bullshit.  What, he's making you do all this stuff when you don't feel well?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  I told you I don't want to do that shit.  Let's go, man.  Let's go.  Fuck.  Damn, I told you.  They went right for the kill for a crazy phone call.  We're trying to do...  We have a whole different thing we wanted to do.  Fuck that, man.  We have a whole different thing we wanted to do today.  What did you want to do? 
[03:34:00]  We had other stuff that we wanted to get over.  We didn't want to get over all the craziness.  I didn't want to get them all riled up.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Trying to make money off this guy.  Yeah.  We'll do this.  We'll do this.  What did...  I wasn't in there.  What did he say?  Well, they went right into a phone call with someone, like, you know, insulting him so  he could just do the, you know, curse at him, and he didn't want to do that.  We had a whole thing we wanted to promote here, and it just didn't, just, you know...  Thank God we missed that part.  ...what we needed to promote, and it's just...  Don't bring me again. 
[03:34:30]  Fuck them all around the head.  No more again for that.  No more bullshit.  I'm done, dude.  I'm done.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  J-Force is funny.  That's it.  They were like an old gay couple towards the end, weren't they?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Wow.  And it just kept, like...  It was kind of hard to pick up on the recording, but he kept going, like, when the Iron  Cheek was there, Sam, what are you doing?  And then leaning in real close and said, I'm sorry, Sam.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  I don't...  It was obvious.  I mean, and then...  I don't...  Schick. 
[03:35:00]  And the Sheek is...  He's a manager.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the hell happened.  It's very strange.  I don't know what's going on.  Jay Morris.  I don't give a shit.  No, I just...  I mean...  Whatever.  I don't think he's long for this world, the Iron Man.  Oh, we missed 20 minutes of...  I think we got his last interview.  Did he just suck my dick?  Yeah.  I think that was his last interview.  I'll tell you the truth.  I think he's gonna die.  What we wanted was to get him back in so Jim Jeffries would go after him.  Yeah.  That's all we're trying to do.  He's the guy that would hit you, though.  He's the guy that would take a swing at you.  Yeah, but I...  I'd take a swing at you.  There's not many professional wrestlers I think I could beat, but I think... 
[03:35:30]  Fuck.  I think I'm more nimble than the Iron Sheik.  I'm not saying I would actually beat him in a fight.  I think I could outrun him.  I could get out of the way.  I could get out of the way quickly.  It takes space, dude.  I bet you if he fucking threw himself at you, he's a strong, old Iranian wrestler.  He's a problem, dude, to this day.  We're not good with washed-up wrestlers.  I just think that would be good for my career, getting beaten up by the Iron Sheik.  I'd take that for it.  So Ventura has walked off this show, and the Iron Sheik, two wrestling legends, have walked 
[03:36:00]  off of this program.  Bad things come in threes, right?  That's right.  I can't wait.  Maybe Bob Backlund can come in with all the cuntfaces.  Roddy Piper.  Are we going to include Gary Coleman?  No, he doesn't count in your bad three.  Another one that won't be back.  We were nice to Gary.  Yeah, we were.  He might have walked out, but I think we were.  No, he was actually a fan.  I think we did all right with him.  Who was that?  Gary Coleman.  I think he seemed like a sweet guy.  Yeah.  No, he was a bitter guy.  He was a nice guy.  He was a very nice guy. 
[03:36:30]  Dude, how many bad hands can you be dealt?  If that makes sense.  I know.  Exactly.  Fucking, I'm adopted.  My kidneys are fucked up.  I'm short.  Wait, he was adopted too?  Yeah, he was adopted.  My adopted parents took my money.  They're the ones trying to make your money.  Everybody calls me a shrimp and all the midget and all that shit.  Some short stuff.  Yeah.  Right.  Dude, even when he died, somebody sent me an email and they go, Gary Coleman's casket.  And it was a picture of that Coleman cooler.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I didn't smell Coleman cooler.  Wait, really?  And I was just like.  Where's that? 
[03:37:00]  Oh, did that come from the show?  No, it probably did.  But we did a whole bed yesterday, wasn't it?  Or two days ago.  I was like, all right.  Enough with the Coleman cooler.  People still try to show you like it's new.  He's one of those guys.  I was just literally, when that happened, I was just like, gee, even when he's dead, it's  still just a fucking joke.  I don't care how good his intentions were.  If he ticked the box on his license that said organ donor, but I don't think any of them  are any good.  No, they're all just rotten.  A little rotten, rejected kidneys. 
[03:37:30]  His toes look like little macadamia nuts.  Body's too small, so all those organs are earmarked.  They're just like bent.  We do have the trifecta of wrestlers walking out, by the way.  Wrinkled.  Can you fucking let the man rest in peace?  All right.  You're forgetting the greatest wrestler to walk out on us.  We do have a trifecta.  What is that?  The Rock.  Oh, the Rock.  With the racist shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Why did the Rock, what did you say to the Rock?  Dude, it was.  It was some guy that ran a website, and he wanted to come in here.  Sick Boy.  Sick Boy's back on Twitter.  Oh, is he? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  He wanted to come in and meet the Rock, and we were like, cool, because we had talked  to him for a few times and shit like that.  And we're like, you know what?  He might have a couple questions we don't.  Yeah, having that.  Some of that inside shit.  So we're like, yeah, come on in.  Invite him in.  We don't know him that well.  He did the show a few times, seemed nice enough.  So the Rock looks at him, and he asks the Rock a question.  Well, no, I go sick.  He tells the Rock who he is.  Okay, I go sick boy, you got a question.  And the Rock recognized the name from this website, because the Rock knew about this  website, and the Rock had read some racist comments about himself on this website. 
[03:38:30]  The Rock walked off the show.  The Rock walked off the show.  What ethnicity is the Rock?  Jesus Christ.  The Rock is like Samoan.  All those great interviews.  Oh, he's walking right out the door.  Just gone.  We didn't know.  We call him Koganauts in Australia.  Ed, he's put some psycho listener on.  What could happen?  That's done well by us.  That's why they used to do that on Nightline, didn't they?  Ted Cobb would be like, you know what?  I was going to ask the interview.  No, he was going to do that.  I just had this guy from fucking Tennessee.  I was going to have me ask you a couple of questions. 
[03:39:00]  I'm sure nothing could go wrong with this.  He might be right.  Take the floor.  He might be right.  He walked out on us.  By the way, Anthony's Bulge, which I have Twittered a picture of, he's got over a thousand  views already.  All right.  Everybody wants to see that delicious cock.  It's just tight nut bulge, though.  Whatever it is.  Yeah.  It's, you know.  Fucking sing Love Me Like a Reptile on those little tight slacks.  Fucking some boots.  Ed, you want the Bobo update?  He called that number we gave him for your ex. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let's see.  Yeah, let's talk to Bobo.  Bobo.  So, earlier in the show, you admitted that you have something for Anthony's ex of nine  years.  And that you actually masturbate to her.  Yeah.  He talked to Melinda at a gig or something.  And now he jerks off to her and thinks he's going to get a date with her.  Right.  So, we gave Bobo her number.  Bobo, what happened?  Yeah.  Well, apparently you guys gave the number on air and there was a lot of busy signals. 
[03:40:00]  And when I finally got through, she just, she probably picked up and it was just completely  quiet.  You have to talk, though.  Yeah.  What did you say?  Did you say anything?  I said, yeah.  I said, yeah, it's me.  It's me, Bobo.  I got, they gave me this number.  I want to make, I just wanted to make sure it was the right number.  You got all the lines.  Oh, wow.  So, what happened?  Nothing.  Just got hung up on.  By who?  You've got to be persistent.  Women love a persistent man. 
[03:40:30]  Like, you've got to keep calling, show up at the house, stand at the front of the house.  A lot of people called her because you gave the number on air.  I didn't give it out on air.  Well, the busy signal sounded like it was.  And who picked up and what did they say?  There was no one.  It was just complete other silence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's the update.  Well, Bobo.  It's a hell of an update.  I'll put in a good word for you.  It's quite the theater of the mind you do. 
[03:41:00]  I was like, well, should I try calling again?  Yeah.  Call as often as you can until you get through.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  That's it for you today.  You were really good in the beginning of the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Not so much right now.  Not so much right now.  All right.  Mike in Albany.  Mike.  Hey, Opie, wasn't the Rock interview the one where when he walked off, you told him  he was nothing and would never be as big as y'all were?  Well, we might have said that to the Rock Bill Burr. 
[03:41:30]  Because then I got mad that he didn't see it our way because I'm like, we don't know  this guy.  Come back.  We'll fucking smooth this over.  And then when he said no, I'm like, you know what?  Yeah.  You'll never be as big as Andy and I.  You'll never be as big as we are.  He was kind of just coming up and just starting to peak.  What a pompous, dumb state boy.  Anyway, that really worked out in my favor.  I think he's on his eighth movie, making about $10 to $20 million a picture.  We've all been there.  I auditioned for that Tooth Fairy film. 
[03:42:00]  Did you?  Yeah.  Tooth Fairy?  Yeah.  And it's very few.  I've never been in a movie, but sometimes I was like, thank God I didn't get that one.  Yeah, that wasn't one you wanted.  That's the one you always get the callback for because you don't give a shit.  Yeah, he's so loose and relaxed.  We love to have him on the set.  I remember they were doing, I think I told this story, I auditioned like maybe 14 or  15 years ago.  Remember that show Fame?  Yeah.  They were doing Fame LA and they needed a comedian. 
[03:42:30]  No.  So it's one of those deals.  I'm early in my career and it's just like, you don't know that you have a choice.  So if they just say you have an audition, so I'm going, I don't want to get this shit.  So I went in, of course, I get a callback.  I got all the way to testing in front of the network where we had to do improv with  like some of the groundlings down literally at the improv.  And fortunately, I kind of butchered that and I didn't get it.  But I was sitting there kind of like I was in a panic.  That you might actually get it.  Yeah.  I'm going to get on.  You know how bad a TV show has to be to throw you into a panic? 
[03:43:00]  That you might get it.  I'm going to be on a TV show.  Oh, I can pay my bills.  Fame LA came this close.  Did that show actually go ahead?  Fame LA?  You know what?  I don't know.  I don't remember hearing about it.  I'm so fucking wrapped up in my own.  What was Fame LA?  I'm sorry.  He was talking about auditioning for the movie Tooth Fairy and that's one you don't want  to get.  And I was just telling those stories where you go and it's a piece of shit so you don't  care.  And it comes off as like you know what you're doing.  Right. 
[03:43:30]  Because you could give a fuck.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  He's improvising?  This kid's got balls.  That show never made TV I don't think, right?  They never did LA fame.  I have no idea.  I don't remember ever seeing it or hearing about it that I would watch it.  That was during the time of like Cop Rock.  Did they franchise him out like CSI or something?  Oh wow.  Yeah.  Cop Rock.  Yeah.  What a great idea.  Let's have a cop show where they sing and dance.  Oof.  That wouldn't even have worked in the 40s. 
[03:44:00]  No.  A Busby Berkeley production.  Hello my baby.  Hello my honey.  You got a fucking ticket.  We could do one more thing today.  What?  Yes.  Oh Ant's looking at his watch.  What do you got today?  What do you got today?  He's going to the range.  No.  I had to switch things around with the trainer.  Some things.  You got a personal trainer?  Yes.  He looks good.  Your forearms look fucking good. 
[03:44:30]  Anthony buffs up quickly.  I am like fucking.  Look at that.  Look at me.  That's what I've been doing.  No.  He has those white trash jeans from all those ancestors of loading and unloading trucks.  Just a skinny idiot with a fucking big dick and fucking good definition in his biceps.  That's all I got.  You fucking wiry cunt.  That long blue collar back.  And then you got those fucking midget legs.  You can pick up a box without bending over.  Long blue collar back.  Oh fuck. 
[03:45:00]  Remember those kids?  They always took shop class.  Their fucking eyes are.  I can never make it to their waist.  There was the guy.  And those guys on the job sites always had like the leather weight belt that they'd wear  at work.  Oh yeah.  Just so when they're lifting stuff up they don't pull their back out.  As opposed to asking for help.  Yeah.  I know.  They're lifting fucking washing machines and shit.  Why don't you have a friend help you you fucking scumbag.  Dummy.  Well you want to play this or not?  Or you want to get out of here?  What is it?  Just a fucking woman calling 911 looking for a husband. 
[03:45:30]  Oh excellent.  Excellent.  That was a great clip.  Great clip.  Comedy.  Yeah let's get some comedy on the air.  You called three times.  What do you need?  I called you back.  You don't answer.  What is your emergency?  What can the police department help you with at this very moment?  What do you need?  I don't answer because my telephone is off.  Okay well it's not off because you keep dialing 911 and not answering.  You hang up and you don't.  You're not there.  What do you need us to do for you right now?  I have an emergency call on the other line. 
[03:46:00]  I need to get a husband.  You need to get a husband.  Yeah.  You're calling 911 to get a husband.  Well.  That is not.  That doesn't.  Yes.  You know you can get arrested for dialing 911.  Do you know you can get arrested for dialing 911?  Let's do it.  You want to get arrested for dialing 911?  Absolutely.  Okay.  You stay on the line okay?  Thank you dear.  She's drunk.  Audrey.  Okay we're going to send you an officer okay?  Thank you.  You're welcome. 
[03:46:30]  Bye bye.  Just another fucking burden.  Another me me me.  Another fucking nut.  Me.  We really should just start putting fucking bullets in the people's temple.  Me.  No but I also think the fucking woman.  The 911 woman.  If you're so concerned about the line being held up.  Just hang up on this fucking bitch.  She'll keep calling back.  She's had enough of this bitch.  I once when I was a kid.  Was driving home.  And I saw like a fucking tree on fire.  That had hit like the power wires. 
[03:47:00]  Right?  Yeah.  So I'm driving home and I've seen this and it's late at night.  I was working in this bar so I've come home.  I was 18 years old.  So I go knock on the fucking door where there's trees on fire at the front and wake the family  up and go there's trees on fire.  Right?  Then I call the fire engine thinking I'm a fucking god.  I've just saved people.  In my mind I just saved lives.  Right?  And I ring up and I go there's a fire at the front of this house.  And then they go okay what's the address?  And I go um it's fucking on the corner of fucking. 
[03:47:30]  And the lady goes if you're going to speak like that I'll just hang up on you.  And I'm like are you fucking kidding?  I'm a hero.  But she was upset about the fucking swearing.  And she works on the 911.  Yeah maybe you should be prepared for people using some language.  This guy just fucking stand me sir.  Sir.  Sir.  Sir.  It's no surprise to me that he did if you're using language like that.  Yes. 
[03:48:00]  Ugh.  Maybe if you cleaned it up and stopped shouting.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh what a bunch of knuckleheads.  I can only tell you about this.  I know when Chip's ready to talk.  Yes Chip.  This lady probably is saying watch your language.  You're probably like what are you talking about?  This whole place is burning right?  I'm telling you what.  It's so uncomfortable.  It's just not.  All right.  I think we did it. 
[03:48:30]  Yes we did.  What do we got Jim?  Jeffrey.  Stress Factory.  Tonight.  Stress Factory.  Sunday.  Wilbur Theatre in Boston coming up soon.  That's next weekend.  Second show added because the first one sold out.  God damn.  What do we got?  Beer content may kill oil.  Is that what they're going to do?  I mean the sound is down.  Are they going to dump yeast into the gulf?  Some kind of thing that will actually eat the oil.  It will make it into Vegemite. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  Then it will shit out something else.  I'm going to bring some in for you.  Next time I'm in I'm bringing you some in to fucking eat.  Next time I'm in.  That's like a black guy saying he's going to bring in some kind of stereotypical black food.  Like a stolen stereo.  I wasn't going to say anything.  I'm just saying he's having an Australian saying he's going to bring in a Vegemite.  It's like you know.  Oh good.  And I'll bring in some galamide.  It is never fucking.  Are you a Dago?  Are you a Tony?  I'm all fucking Dago. 
[03:49:30]  Dago'd out.  Yep.  Goddamn Guinea.  It's hard not to be. </pre>
