<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a JetBlue flight attendant's meltdown and subsequent emergency slide escape, prompting vulgar commentary and a listener poll on whether he was a "hero" or a "jerk."  The hosts also debated the exorbitant rent of a Pop-Tarts themed store in Times Square, using information from a Twitter user.  This was followed by a discussion of a dramatic speech from *Network*, which they linked to the flight attendant's behavior.  A listener call unexpectedly led to a lengthy and humorous tangent on porcupines, including detailed descriptions of their mating habits, fueled by online videos of porcupine-dog interactions. The segment concluded with unsubstantiated claims of a hostage situation and a caller's fabricated story of having sex in a Baltimore alley. No in-studio guests were present during this segment.

The show then transitioned into a segment focused on two topics:  the hosts' frustrations with a new, slippery iPad stylus, leading to colorful language and comedic anecdotes involving one host's girlfriend; and a discussion about the high mortality rate among former WWE wrestlers, triggered by Linda McMahon's Senate campaign.  Audio clips from her *Nightline* interview were played and analyzed, focusing on her attempts to deflect questions about wrestler deaths.  The hosts and a caller engaged in a running joke listing deceased wrestlers,  followed by a discussion of TNA wrestling, Hulk Hogan's decline, and the use of "blading."  Clips from a Hogan, Sting, and Flair match and a Scott Steiner promo were played, along with a clip of Hulk Hogan berating Abyss.  A caller described a wrestling DVD drinking game based on counting deceased wrestlers.

Next, the show covered Mick Foley's heel turn in TNA wrestling, briefly mentioned Linda McMahon winning her primary, and then focused on a video of a Vermont corrections officer, Barry Mulcahy, being tased after a DUI arrest.  The audio of his profane interaction with police was played. Several callers, including Ari and Mike from the NYPD,  Kenny (a retired police officer), and various other listeners, shared anecdotes about police work, often using offensive language, covering topics such as police procedure, the use of force (nightsticks, tasers, pepper spray), the decline of the "brotherhood," the increased prevalence of cameras and surveillance, sleeping on duty, and cover-ups.  A call about Cleveland officers mistaking a naked, robbed woman for a deer concluded this segment, directly preceding the arrival of in-studio guest Amy Schumer.  Schumer's arrival was marked by a discussion of her severe sunburn and a surfing injury.

The show then featured Amy Schumer as a guest. The conversation covered a range of topics, beginning with ocean fears, transitioning to Schumer's single status and dating anxieties. This led to sexually explicit jokes, discussions of pornography, Schumer's weight loss, eating disorders, and a sunburn. The conversation also included offensive jokes about Schumer's family, specifically her father's illness and incontinence, and her own experiences with STDs. The hosts repeatedly made offensive comments about race and sexuality.  Schumer's upcoming comedy shows, a *Curb Your Enthusiasm* appearance, and her new show *A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus* were mentioned. Listener calls contributed to the crude and offensive tone.  The segment concluded with more sexually charged banter and unflattering anecdotes about Schumer from her tourmates.

Finally,  Schumer and the hosts discussed a comedy special tentatively titled "Ladies Who Kill" and the difficulties with its branding.  This quickly devolved into highly explicit and vulgar conversations about sex, including detailed accounts of Schumer's sexual experiences and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  The hosts showed Schumer disturbing internet content, including videos depicting extreme acts and fetishes, playing a recording of Bobby Kelly's reaction (which involved vomiting). The segment concluded with promotion of Schumer's upcoming shows and the show's own programming.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now?  It doesn't get better than this. 
[00:00:30]  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule.  Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  Fucking believe it.  This is radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Hi.  There's everybody.  Now I could hear. 
[00:01:00]  And they're talking about the JetBlue guy.  That seems to be the big story, isn't it?  They call him a planiac.  A planiac?  Yeah.  It's like a maniac, but with planes.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh!  That's funny.  The media is enjoying...  I call him a fruit.  Yeah.  He loves the gi.  Oh, does he love the cock, this guy?  He loves the gi.  Oh, can't get enough of the cock. 
[00:01:30]  But the media loves this guy.  I dare say he's a media darling, Anthony.  Media darling?  Wow.  They love their media darlings, the news.  This guy...  I guess he's holed up in some apartment on the east side right now.  Is he just fucking...  And sucking.  Just ass fucking.  It's fantastic, isn't it?  That's the topper on the story, though.  Oh, yeah.  And then he went home and had gay sex.  Downed his beer. 
[00:02:00]  And just fucking opened up.  His boyfriend, I guess, who gave a little statement.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  And wow.  Yeah.  I don't know who's the guy in this relationship.  You gotta think our hero is.  Yeah?  You gotta think he's the guy in the relationship.  Our hero.  Well, I'm voting hero.  What?  You're voting jerk?  I'm voting jerk.  The news is giving the people an opportunity to vote.  And your two choices are hero or jerk. 
[00:02:30]  Or jerk.  You know, I'll give Sully the hero thing as far as airplanes go.  Mm-hmm.  This guy...  What did he do that he's a hero?  But he's not a jerk, is he?  Well, some people might say he's a jerk.  How about a third choice?  Somewhere in between hero and jerk.  He had...  It's simply the best...  It's the best job quitting ever.  It's how every guy...  Yeah, it is.  ...wants to quit.  Except for the part where you go home and get fucked in the ass by another man. 
[00:03:00]  No, I actually...  I actually would take a dick just to have this story.  I don't think this guy was taken.  I think he was given.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  He needed to get some anger out.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Feel bad for his boyfriend.  Maybe after he gave, he received.  You think?  Yeah, maybe.  A little switcheroo.  Yeah, you know, I don't know how it works with the gay.  But I'm thinking you could just do it and then do it the other way.  One of the papers put the speech from Network in the paper today in honor of this fine guy. 
[00:03:30]  That he's...  You see that, Jimmy, in the Daily News, I think?  What's that?  Go like two pages in in the Daily News.  They got the dude from Network.  And the speech.  Oh, I see.  I am as...  I'm mad as hell.  Peter Finch?  I'm not gonna take it anymore.  Yeah.  I think it's on like page four or five.  Oh, yeah.  Where is it?  What are they...  It's on page four, yeah.  Thanks for handing me the paper I didn't want. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, shit.  That's a great speech.  Do we have that?  I want to kind of...  I think I want to play the speech today because...  It's phenomenal.  I was telling Anthony, I'm reading the speech from Network, which is a great movie.  Yeah.  It kind of forced...  It was basically looking into the future.  Everything they talked about in Network is happening right now.  But that speech he did could relate to what's going on today in the world.  He's a...  Peter Finch is a network guy who's about to retire.  He's a news anchor.  He's about to retire.  And he snaps. 
[00:04:30]  And he threatens to kill himself on the air.  Isn't it kind of forced retirement?  It might have been, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But he says, tomorrow on the news, I'm going to blow my brains out.  He just loses it.  And they keep him on.  For some reason, they let him go back on.  He becomes his guru.  And he just kind of snaps.  Yeah.  T-Storm has the speech.  I'm going to ask you for this.  Yeah, let's listen to this.  The famous speech from Network.  I don't have to tell you things are bad.  Everybody knows things are bad.  It's a depression.  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. 
[00:05:00]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.  Banks are going bust.  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.  Punks are running wild in the streets.  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do.  And there's no end to it.  We know the air is unfit to breathe.  And our food is unfit to eat.  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes.  As if that's the way it's supposed to be.  We know things are bad.  Worse than bad.  They're crazy. 
[00:05:30]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy.  So we don't go out anymore.  We sit in the house.  And slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller.  And all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios.  And I won't say anything.  Just leave us alone.  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.  I want you to get mad.  I don't want you to protest.  I don't want you to ride.  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. 
[00:06:00]  All I know is that first you've got to get mad.  You've got to say, I'm a human being.  God damn it.  My life has value.  So, I want you to get up now.  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore! 
[00:06:30]  Damn, I just got chills.  That's great, right?  What a great speech.  Yeah.  You could be talking about 2010, except for the Russians.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the only thing that sounded dated in that whole speech.  It's the Muslims.  And the sound quality.  Yeah, let's throw Muslims in there.  The sound quality is weird because it's flipping around from different angles.  And like, in some moments you're seeing him in the studio.  Other moments they're fucking, you're watching it on a TV.  They're staying on TV, yeah.  Or the sound jumps around.  Oh, okay.  I was trying to figure out what that was about.  And I think that was 76.  76.  76, okay.  Damn.  Wow.  See, nothing changed.  So the paper has that today for our hero, the JetBlue hero. 
[00:07:00]  Hero.  What hero?  I mean, I understand.  He's a hero to the working man.  It is kind of a great way to quit.  But hero?  Jimmy said it's the greatest quitting ever.  Yeah, but does that make you a hero?  Well, you know, it's just something.  It's the dumb news.  JetBlue has a problem on their hands.  Yeah.  Yeah, because a lot of people are digging this guy.  Nah, they're going to still take cheap flights with TVs in the back of the seat.  Whether this guy fucking is out of work. 
[00:07:30]  He's so fired.  He's so fired.  He's so fired.  The emergency.  I guess you're not allowed to really fucking.  Who would trust him in midair if he snapped again?  Yeah, exactly.  That's just it.  You can't have this guy.  I think I'd do it very, very carefully, I'm saying.  This guy has the ninja, too?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's got the high five.  I love the hype.  The high five.  Oh, jeez.  Well.  He's the working man's hero.  Come on.  He definitely has had it. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's as gay as hell, and he's not going to take this anymore.  Anymore.  Anymore.  I want you to go to your boyfriend's asshole, and open it up, and stick your dick in.  Yes.  My cock's as hard as hell.  I'm not going to take this anymore.  Anymore.  Anymore.  I love how you say more.  Yeah, he does.  Anymore.  Anymore.  Yeah, network is a fucking must say. 
[00:08:30]  Just stand up, get off of your butt plugs, and go to the window.  Your boyfriend keeps a gerbil under the bed.  So should we vote hero or jerk?  I'm saying jerk.  You've got to go with jerk, because you're almost too strong.  I think neither.  I think you're right.  There's got to be a third option.  Well, the news is just stupid.  Hero or jerk, I would go...  Just to make a few bucks on their text messaging system.  Yeah, that's what it is. 
[00:09:00]  See, what bothers me is, as a flight attendant, we've all had the asshole flight attendant who  was annoying, unreasonably annoying.  Yeah.  The guy who's...  And this guy's probably just like that.  Like a ball breaker, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  He doesn't come across likable.  No, no.  Everyone's looking at him like he's the working man's hero, but he seems kind of like he would  be a real fucking kind of bitch in the air.  Yeah.  This is the guy...  Everyone's saying hero or whatever, but this is the guy that, if you're on his flight, he's 
[00:09:30]  the biggest fucking asshole you've ever had to deal with.  Sure.  As far as your bags go.  Sure.  What do they call him, the bag Nazi, right?  Well, he referenced himself as the bag Nazi when he was on a website.  He's like, I hate to be...  Is that because other men's bags are on his eyes and he can't see?  He's the bag Nazi.  Yeah.  What he does is he likes when the balls are on his face because it feels like a little  Hitler mustache.  That's where the Nazi part comes in. 
[00:10:00]  And he just mumbles into their scrotum, I'm essential to the war.  Schindler's taint.  He doesn't like to be a bag Nazi, but he feels if he's not, people who are doing the right  thing get penalized by people who are just being selfish.  I only bring carry-on size bags onto my flights when I'm carrying on a bag.  And this guy sees the bags and says, no, it's too big. 
[00:10:30]  Get it or you got to check it.  And people go, no, no, it fits.  It doesn't matter.  Get the fuck out of here.  And that's what this guy was.  I've never heard of his fitting and having to be checked.  It was that prick.  Unless it was late.  I don't know.  Yeah, it might have been that.  It might have been that.  But he's one of these guys that would just tell people, no, get the fuck.  Check it.  Check it, bitch.  And good for him.  Because when you come on the plane with your little carry-on, you have nowhere to put it.  I know.  Because people are shoving their bag.  I could stick it up this guy's ass, apparently. 
[00:11:00]  Fuck, I got it.  Could you carry this bag for me?  And then went home and had gay sex.  Gay sex.  Now the news is downplaying that, but that wasn't the original story.  Oh, that was the original story.  It was like, because it was just supposed to be a nutty guy story.  Right.  Nutty guy story, last one day.  So it was like, and then he went home and had gay sex, was arrested during gay sex.  Jordan, just listened to the Peter Finch speech.  Yeah.  And yes, it does say in there, let me have my toaster. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, I know.  Isn't that odd?  Let me have my toaster.  That's funny.  See, the speech is relevant today.  Very relevant after yesterday.  All I want is my stupid toaster in this joint.  We can't even have that.  Well, I guess we're allowed to have it in the kitchen.  Because if a toaster is in the kitchen, Anthony, it's not a fire hazard.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  I want my Pop-Tarts, and I'm not going to take it anymore.  Anymore.  Anymore.  Is the news still just pounding away at the Pop-Tarts store? 
[00:12:00]  You know what?  I think not.  Someone sent me a tweet overnight.  It looks like they know a little something-something about the Pop-Tarts World store, or whatever  it's called.  Pop-Tarts World.  Supposedly their rent.  You want to guess how much their rent is, if this guy is right?  And I'm thinking he's got to be right.  I'm thinking he knows a little something about real estate in the Times Square area, this  guy that tweeted me overnight.  I couldn't imagine.  We did a whole thing on the Pop-Tarts thing yesterday.  Everyone knows, right?  Yeah, the big Pop-Tarts store opened up in Times Square.  The store looks like a complete fucking disaster. 
[00:12:30]  It's not even really in Times Square.  It's off a little side street.  Because as soon as you get off Broadway or 7th, you're not with the people anymore, really.  No, no.  I mean, the crowds dwindle drastically.  Definitely.  As soon as you make that left or that right.  I'm going to guess 10,000 a month.  Seriously?  Are you doing a Master Poe on me?  What's wrong with you?  So much more.  Honestly, my initial guess was 20,000, and I was like, I'm way off?  Way the fuck off.  It's got to be in the hundred thousands, right? 
[00:13:00]  Way off.  This guy, if he's correct, says their rent is 1.3 million a month.  Nah, I don't think so.  How do you pay that much?  It's Times Square.  Yeah, but 1.3 million a month.  1.3 million a month.  You have to pay $13 million before you break even.  Make that kind of scratch with Pop-Tarts.  1.3 mil.  Here we go.  Pop-Tart.  Okay, it's J-W-O-A-K-S on Twitter. 
[00:13:30]  Pop-Tart World's rent is estimated at 1.3 million a month.  The lease runs until January.  Then they will decide to keep it long-term.  So maybe for a short-term thing.  I don't know.  This guy seems to know what he's talking about.  I don't know.  I have no idea what the rent is in Times Square.  I've never tried to rent anything there.  But I wouldn't even...  Because it's an epic fail.  I need to do a little math. 
[00:14:00]  Wait, what do you got?  It's a 3,200 square foot shop.  So if I could just look at some real estate prices and see what the square footage is.  3,200 square feet.  How much they're charging per square foot in and around Times Square, I could probably get  a good estimate for them.  Well, it's safe to say the place is going to be one of the biggest disasters ever for  Times Square.  3,200 a square foot?  So that would be $1,000 per square foot?  No, it just says that this is a 3,200 square foot shop.  Right.  So I just need to see how much per square foot real estate is going for. 
[00:14:30]  If it was $1,000 a square foot, then it would be 3.2 million.  What?  32.  Yeah, so I think this guy is on to something, man.  That's why you don't see mom and pop stores in Times Square.  You've got to sell a lot of shit to pay your bills.  It used to be where the whores hung out and the drug dealers.  1.3 million.  And now they're possibly getting $1.3 million a month for the Pop-Tart store. 
[00:15:00]  A month?  Mm-hmm.  The guy comes and breaks your fucking legs.  That's a lot of Pop-Tarts.  Who's the landlord?  Who's making that kind of money?  It's got to be some foreign fucking conglomerate.  Some Russian.  Some Russian.  From Russian to some Cheney.  Some Cheney.  Maybe some Cheney.  Cheney.  He's getting the lucrative Pop-Tart money.  Someone is saying $1,500 per Times Square foot.  Kevin from Connecticut.  How does he know?  How do you know?  Maybe he just looked it up.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  And I'm all.  Bop. 
[00:15:30]  It's about $1,000 square foot.  It says Times Square expensive is real expensive.  Between $44 and $46, rent is around $1,000 per square foot.  Then it drops to $400 at 42nd Street and South.  And this Pop-Tart store is off the beaten path.  How much do you think it is?  So if $1,000 is like main Times Square, and then it says here $400 when you kind of get 
[00:16:00]  away from it all.  So we could probably estimate it at about $400, I'd say.  So then that would bring the $3,200 down to almost $1,500.  Maybe.  Yeah, you're right.  $1,500.  Like $1,300 even.  That's what the guy said.  What the guy said.  Yeah.  God, that's a lot of fucking money.  Huh?  That's a lot of fucking money.  That's ridiculous.  For a store where there were eight people in there.  I know.  One of them being Sam Roberts.  They better be spending $100,000 a piece.  That place is in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  How much did we actually put in their till yesterday? 
[00:16:30]  And now they're in trouble.  They got all the media attention yesterday.  That was it.  No one's going to be talking about Pop-Tarts today.  Will we be talking about Pop-Tarts today?  I don't think so.  Well, we just did, but we did talking about how we're not going to talk about it.  Actually, all the Pop-Tarts that those guys brought back from Pop-Tart World turned me off.  I don't want a Pop-Tart anytime soon now.  No.  They look disgusting.  They don't look appetizing.  It looks like they're just throwing shit in plastic containers with crumbled Pop-Tarts in there with it.  I have a kid in the back that just chews up the fucking Pop-Tarts and spits them out so they can put them in apple pies and cherry pies and stuff. 
[00:17:00]  Good luck.  Is that a regurgitation?  Yeah.  Like a bird?  Godspeed, Pop-Tarts world.  Godspeed.  Godspeed to ye.  I'd love to know who this bitch is that this guy yelled at because she sounds like a real twat.  The passenger?  Yeah.  She seems to be in hiding.  Yeah, why does she come forward?  Why is she in hiding?  She's a real twat because she had an argument before the... 
[00:17:30]  She did.  You figured this thing out, right?  Like, the plane obviously landed and they're taxiing toward the fucking terminal.  And that's when everyone gets up and some flight attendants just let you be and others have to be Nazis.  Like, oh, no, not until we, you know, come to a complete stop at the terminal.  Well, it looks like...  And I guarantee that's what happened.  They had argued.  And said, fuck that, I'm getting my shit together already.  The woman had argued with another woman before they left Pittsburgh.  Overhead bags.  Right.  And she was a twat about it.  And she had one bag that wouldn't fit, so he made her check it. 
[00:18:00]  I guess because she brought him...  And then she opened the thing and it hit him in the head or something like that.  Oh, knocked him in the noggin.  It might have been there when they landed.  But when they landed, he fought with her again.  So he had argued with the same woman twice.  She sounds like a real cunt.  Hmm.  Decided.  I love just saying that.  That was it.  That word is really becoming popular.  I mean, on the radio, it's so nice to just people say she's like a cunt because that's  what she seems like.  Instead of saying she seems like a real lump of toenails.  I'm a fan of the word twat.  Great word. 
[00:18:30]  Always liked that one.  I like the twat.  Yeah.  I like saying twat.  I like slit.  You like slit?  Yeah, when you go, yeah, I was talking to this slit yesterday.  You think they like that?  It's so degrading.  Just narrow it down to the lowest common denominator.  I'm talking to a slit.  It's horrible.  Now people know real estate prices in Times Square.  We don't care anymore, right?  We're past that.  It's expensive.  Of course.  And yes, the flight attendant did get hit in the head. 
[00:19:00]  And then he went home and got some.  He didn't mind that.  No.  I love the word jerk.  He's a jerk.  That's my favorite word right now.  I think this guy's getting too much positive fucking press.  He's all smiles.  He's getting too much positive something else, too.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Why, man?  We need a story like this, don't we, Ant?  Do we?  We like these kind of feel-good stories.  Is it a feel-good story? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, because I think a lot of people want to quit.  First of all, they want to quit their jobs.  And second, they want to do it in such a way that it's impressive without them having to take their own lives afterwards or going to jail for a long time.  Like, this guy's going to get a joke sentence.  I'm looking at it like I don't want this guy on a flight in any way, shape, or form.  No, he's not going to be flying anytime soon.  Yeah, but, you know, it looks to me like instead of him quitting in some way that everybody wants to quit their job and kind of a big F you to the boss kind of a thing, it's like, good. 
[00:20:00]  This fucking guy was a ticking time bomb.  Get him out of there.  I bet you he's on a no-fly list because he knows how to fucking do some shit.  He knows how to work all that shit.  Right.  I bet you he's on a no-fly list for a while.  You can't pull that slide without there being some repercussions.  We all want to slide down the slide, though, don't we?  Well, it looks fun.  I don't care how old you are.  You just want to slide.  It does look fun, but you can't do it unless there's some kind of horrible thing going on. 
[00:20:30]  So it's a bittersweet thing, that slide.  Is it?  You're going, wee, I'm able to do it.  But in order to do it, you're like, wow, we just crashed.  Your fellow passengers are burning inside.  Yeah, yeah.  Fighting for the one exit that worked.  And you're enjoying your slide into the ocean.  Exactly.  You don't want that.  And then you have to deal with the sharks after you have your fun slide.  I don't want that.  I guess you're right.  No.  The only guy in history that got to enjoy the slide.  Without having to deal with the...  Sharks. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Death.  Destruction.  Right.  You know, mad people would be if you were going down the emergency slide and you refused  to put down your pet porcupines.  Pet porcupines.  I'm wondering why you would have them, but it's Jimmy.  They would ruin the slide, little fellas.  Certainly would.  God, I'd love a pet porcupine.  Me too.  It'd be fun.  Playing the duty off its little spindly things.  Spindly.  You think they throw their needles like they do in cartoons? 
[00:21:30]  I think they just come out.  They just come out?  Yeah.  Like, if a dog is, like, sniffing one and then it touches their nose, I think it pulls  out and the quills stay in their nose because they're, like, barbed.  Oh, really?  And they come out.  But I don't think they could shoot.  Oh, they can't shoot them?  I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think they can.  And then you're running because all the needles are following you?  No, that's cartoons.  And then you have to run through a wall to escape?  Yeah, the porcupine on cartoons, they hunch their back and the quills go flying. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Do they go flying?  The poor dog.  Oh, the side of his face has porcupine quills in it.  Danny found him.  Look at the poor guy.  Oh, my God.  He's just.  No.  Oh, you dumb lab.  If you don't know how to get porcupine quills out of your dog, if he bites porcupine, this  is what you do.  So, cut the end off of it, and it should fall out.  I heard somewhere that you can put vinegar on it after, like, cut it in half, and then 
[00:22:30]  put vinegar on the end of it, and it'll fall out, too.  Oh, the dog is miserable.  Poor poor guy.  The side of his head, he's got some quills.  Oh, the poor guy.  That's what he gets for being a dick.  Biting a porcupine.  He was just being curious.  Dogs are curious.  Do you have any porcupine injuries?  That's a good idea.  Oh.  Look at that thing.  Oof.  Looks like a monkey.  My own business, really.  It's a sort of Sunday walk for me.  I do it every Sunday.  I go past this house up to my tree right there on the hill.  Are these things?  When this dog just ran at me, it just attacked me for no reason. 
[00:23:00]  And I got really scared.  Do we need these things walking around?  And so I put my bottom right in his face.  Just like my mom told me to do.  Where the fuck do they live?  Why is she narrating this like she's the porcupine?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  The porcupine's just walking.  Oh.  But it looks like it walks a weird ginger way so it doesn't jab itself.  Yeah.  It's like fucked up.  It can't walk normally because it's got needles all over it.  It probably has quills on the bottom of its feet.  It's just... 
[00:23:30]  They poke its penis.  Ow.  How do porcupines fuck?  Very carefully.  Yeah.  See, that's the gag.  Yeah.  Oh, that poor guy.  Look at that.  Now they're just showing dogs with quills in them.  What do they do?  Oh, my God.  He's got a muzzle full.  Go to YouTube.  Porcupines versus dogs.  Oh, that poor guy.  What the fuck, man?  What's the gag for biting these fucking things?  These dick dogs.  Oh, my God.  All over the mouths.  They try to bite them.  And then they just walk away with a face full of quills. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And they can extend them up.  I don't think they shoot them out, though.  But they can extend them up because they kind of lay flat.  And make them loose.  Oh, wow.  That's a dog with like a fucking thousand of them right in its face.  What a nightmare of a creature.  Look at that.  What a great defense, though.  Oh, it really is.  This is fucking porcupines versus dogs.  All these dumb dogs with quills in their face.  By the way, porcupine wins every time.  Damn, man. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, it's in the roof of his mouth.  Yeah, we're looking at porcupines that look perfectly fine and dogs are just fucked up.  Yeah, the porcupines are just like, yeah, I'm cool.  No problem here.  And the dogs are just covered.  Poor little fuckers.  But I will tell you that you never fuck with a porcupine again if you're a dog.  No.  It's like a skunk.  They said a bear will fuck with a skunk once in his life and never again.  Yes.  Oh, they saved the worst till last.  Oh, wow.  You never do that in your video.  What's that?  That whole face is covered. 
[00:25:00]  That's a dog face covered in quills.  But wait for it.  Still one more to go.  One more?  Here we go.  It's going to be bad, right?  Well, look at how dramatic this is.  It must be bad.  It's going to be very bad.  The graphic was up there for 10 seconds.  Oh, come on.  That is a dog.  Completely covered.  The entire head is covered.  How'd that happen?  In quills.  They must shoot out.  I wonder if they can eject them.  Or maybe it was a...  He probably grabbed it with his mouth and tried to shake it around and just... 
[00:25:30]  Couldn't have.  You let go of me.  I wonder if it was one or two.  He attacked a couple or he put his head in a nest or something.  You think it would be painful if you got one on the roof of your mouth?  Yes, that would hurt.  They don't really kill them, though, right?  The dogs?  They just didn't hurt them.  No, they fuck them up.  Yeah.  Probably blind the motherfucking dog.  You could blind you, yeah.  I ain't fucking with a porcupine.  Why don't I do that?  I wonder if you could pet one.  I bet you could pet right by his nose.  They're probably very nice.  Chuka, chuka, chuka.  No, chuka.  There are some animals you can't chuka.  And it seems raccoons are those type, too. 
[00:26:00]  You can't chuka.  Porcupines are just defending themselves.  They don't attack anybody.  But if you fuck with them...  Oh, look at the guy.  This guy knows how porcupines mate.  Where the fuck do you find porcupines?  I don't know.  Are they in the U.S.?  I think we got some.  Where?  Like Pacific Northwest, I would guess?  I would guess like maybe in the Midwest.  Really?  Let's go to Joe.  What do you say, Joe?  Down south. 
[00:26:30]  How you doing?  Hello, Joe.  What up, Joe?  I love the show, guys.  Porcupines, actually, we got them all over here in Michigan.  But the underside of the porcupine is all fur.  And the female will actually back up to, usually up in a tree.  She'll back up on a limb up against the base of the tree.  And then the male will come at her belly to belly.  Belly to belly.  Belly to belly.  So they fuck like people?  Exactly, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  A little missionary position thing.  I don't think they wear condoms, though.  Imagine fucking a chick and there's big needles on both your backs to be careful.  Oh, you've got to watch it.  And on a closing note, they don't throw their quills, either.  You have to actually touch them before they come out.  What happens when the animal gets excited?  They fucking stand up straight?  Or they pop up a little bit?  No, they move very slowly.  They walk real slow.  But if you're stupid enough, they're like a dog or a human that might think they can go up and try touching them.  All you do, I mean, you just got to brush against them. 
[00:27:30]  And their quills will stick, didn't you?  Oh, they come right out of the quills.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you press your hand up against them, you're going to come back with a handful of quills, not just one.  I'm also learning that their tail will swing around, obviously.  Oh, and that's full of quills.  So that makes sense, because we saw the dogs with a face full of quills.  Yeah, they probably smacked them in the face with his tail.  Just got smacked by the tail.  Do they grow them back?  Yeah, I think they do, actually.  Oh, that's great.  I'm not a biologist that studies porcupines, but I've seen hundreds of them and been around them all my life. 
[00:28:00]  All right, sir.  I think I might have saw one in a zoo once.  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't even remember.  I wonder if they're nice to pet, though, if you're not going to hit it.  Someone said you could pet it.  No.  I don't know.  You could unquill them and see if they make a nice pet.  I would think the barbs would, like, prevent you from petting them.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Listen to this.  Striker, regular to the show.  You ran over a porcupine once? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I see them all the time in parts of Wyoming and Montana.  And I was just going along one day and seeing this thing waddling along the side of the road and wasn't sure what it was.  And then it kind of turned in front of me.  And I ended up hitting it.  And a couple miles down the road, I was like, why does this truck feel kind of funny?  And apparently the way I caught it, a couple of the quills, they're sharp enough from what I was told.  Because the only thing they could find is a couple of the quills actually pierce the sidewall of the tire. 
[00:29:00]  Jesus.  Imagine what that does to you.  That was the only thing that they could find that caused the tire to go flat.  We're like your porcupine station.  Well, someone has to be at.  I didn't even know how we got on this subject.  I don't know either.  When you drove in today, did you ever think we would be talking about porcupines?  Porcupines?  No.  To this extent?  No. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, because Jimmy sliding down the slide.  Oh, with your pet porcupines?  With your pet porcupines.  Quilling the slide.  Come on, I think it does it every time.  It just pops.  Are there any videos of people?  I'm sorry.  Are there any videos of people with stuff in them?  Yeah.  There's got to be a video of a guy with a fucking quill on them.  There's got to be a man versus porcupine.  People know better, though.  Like, nobody touches them.  It would have to be an accident.  Yeah.  An accidental touching.  Like, you don't realize that he's your opponent.  You sign up to box. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  With a porcupine.  Would you take a porcupine tail to the back?  Well, I'm sure you'd live through it.  You'd live through it, sure.  After being at the beach too long, so you got a really bad sunburn.  Imagine taking one straight onto the hard cock, a porcupine tail.  And then dip it in vinegar to soothe it.  Bear Grylls meets porcupine.  Did he piss on it?  Yes, of course he did.  Why?  Because he just does that.  What?  He loves his urine.  Well, he's marking his territory, Anthony. 
[00:30:30]  Yes, he is.  He's either drinking it or a fucking...  Nice bench-clearing brawl, huh?  Where?  Baseball.  Yeah.  Cardinals.  Cardinals in the...  Reds.  Cincinnati.  Love the bench-clearing brawls.  They took that out of hockey, unfortunately.  They didn't really take it out of baseball yet, though, huh?  No.  It would be simple.  If you leave the fucking dugout, you'd be suspended like they do in hockey.  I wonder why they don't...  You've got to get out there and, you know...  You've got to help your team members. 
[00:31:00]  Can't let them just...  Why is this porcupine humping this skier's leg?  Holy shit.  Because how do you get it...  How do you get it off of you?  I think you got a friend.  Found a friend, Harry.  The porcupine just jumped up on a...  Watch all your edges.  What?  Watch your edges.  Okay.  She's on skis.  And the porcupine is smelling her leg like a dog and climbing up her leg like a dog can be petted.  Oh, God.  I hope it's rabid and bites her right in the pussy. 
[00:31:30]  He's just smelling her a little bit.  He's not giving her a hard time.  You're next.  He's come over here.  Cute animal.  Oh, please fucking smack this guy in the face.  What?  He does?  The porcupine is approaching the one guy and he's up on a...  He's squatting because he doesn't know if he thinks he's going to attack him.  And now it's on time.  It's like on his lap.  But his quills are standing up.  You know how mad people would be if you just hit with a basket? 
[00:32:00]  Everyone would be so angry.  How many views does this video have?  Okay.  This goes nowhere.  Oh, wow.  No, the porcupine...  It's like you're playing Twister.  The guy is squatting and the porcupine came under him.  It's right under his ass now and he can't sit back down.  He's squatting up.  He doesn't know what to do.  I would belt it right in the mouth.  It just wants to be petted.  Nobody pets this thing.  Ah, because it's...  It's got a bunch of needles on it.  Yeah.  You'll get sued. 
[00:32:30]  It's very cute.  It's kind of coming around to be petted.  Yeah.  I didn't think they hung out in the snow like that.  Yeah.  I'm learning all kinds of porcupine facts today.  All I want to do is...  All I want to do is put my hand out and have a porcupine come over and nuzzle it with his nose.  He will not leave this guy alone.  He loves this guy who wants no part of him.  Oh, my God.  He's letting go on.  Crazy.  And the porcupine's crawling on the guy who's sitting there. 
[00:33:00]  I want someone to get quilled.  I just want some fucking friends.  I'm looking at the related videos, and I guess there's a lot of this particular porcupine.  This is like a particular ski resort where there's like a friendly porcupine.  Oh, the friendly porcupine.  Oh, really?  They probably put a big sign up with his face on.  It's like, come here and meet fucking douchebag the porcupine.  He's so cute.  He's standing up on his hind legs.  If you put your hand down, he would just come over and nuzzle it.  And you should get one for your house.  He's just throwing one over his feet. 
[00:33:30]  Get one for you at the compound.  That'd be great.  Walk around the backyard.  Yeah, I know.  He's very cute.  All right, well.  Just let him walk around the backyard.  This guy knows how the quills work.  Noah in Detroit.  Do you?  Yes.  Well, he had two of them.  Yeah.  Noah.  Got it.  What?  The old world style for the old world species that's over in Africa.  They have the quills that point backwards, and they'll actually flare them up and run backwards  at you if you frighten them. 
[00:34:00]  And then the new world porcupines are the ones we have here in the States, and they have only  the quills in their tails.  So you can theoretically pet them, but their quills are actually barbed.  So if they stick you with them, they'll actually work their way deeper into your skin.  And they found, you know, dead mountain lions because the quills will work in and eventually  pierce a heart or something vital.  Wow.  Jesus.  Ow.  His name is Snickers, by the way, the one on the mountain.  No, it's Snickers. 
[00:34:30]  His name is Snickers.  Aw, that's adorable.  Hi, Snickers.  That is adorable.  By the way.  Yeah.  Is Trap Dog in there?  Yeah.  Trap, yes.  Have you watched the Lost epilogue yet?  I have not.  You're waiting for the DVD.  Okay.  I won't say anything.  I couldn't wait.  Well, you know, that's your choice.  I couldn't wait because I thought if I waited, I would take a lot of time, load the disc up. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, it takes time.  And go into the theater and sit down, but for 12 minutes.  So I figured, let me watch it.  And all I'm saying is, I'm glad I didn't wait.  That's your opinion.  Of course it's not going to be good.  It's just my opinion.  No, I will.  It's just my opinion.  I think...  You didn't like it?  I don't want to be any type of spoiler whatsoever to anybody. 
[00:35:30]  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.  All I'm saying, in my opinion...  That's fine.  I think I know what happens.  He takes a while for Jacob, but Mr. Snickers comes onto the island.  Oh my God, you did see it.  And they all try to pet Mr. Snickers.  Mr. Snickers.  Mr. Snickers.  Hurley gets so mad at Ben, he just hurls Mr. Snickers into Ben's face.  Yeah.  What he does is, in the middle of the night, he disguises Mr. Snickers to look like Ben's 
[00:36:00]  butt plug, which Ben fucks himself with.  And then Ben quills the soft skin of his hiney.  Look at Snickers, he fucking loves people.  He comes up on his legs like a dog.  You love Snickers, don't you?  He's great, look at him.  Yeah, little Snickers.  He's fucking waddling off now.  He walks on his hind legs, which is just adorable.  He doesn't know he has quills.  He's like, why won't anybody pet me?  Oh, this shit.  Oops.  Oh, sorry.  Why isn't anybody running away?  I'm friendly. 
[00:36:30]  How about you shave me down?  Yeah.  Look at him, he's on his little hind legs.  He just wants to be petted.  He doesn't understand that he's a fucking menace.  You're a total fucking dangerous thing.  He doesn't understand.  He doesn't get it.  It's like the fucking girlfriend of a big football player drunk trying to talk to you  at a party.  Just get away from me.  No one's petting Snickers.  He's cowards.  You wouldn't pet Snickers.  I would put my hand down and let Snickers jump up and kiss it. 
[00:37:00]  No.  I would.  What if he whapped you with his tail?  Then I'd fucking, I'd beat him at death with my fucking ski pole.  I would.  There'd be blood all over the slope.  Mr. Snickers' feet.  One of them would be hanging off my mirror.  That's why.  I would.  How angry they'd be if you killed little Mr. Snickers.  Do you know how mad they'd be if you bludgeoned Mr. Snickers with a fucking log?  It's all this resort has.  You know they have fucking coffee mugs.  Oh, there's signs and mugs.  And t-shirts in the gift shop.  In the lodge, there's a drink named after him. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Black people get mad if they only can't hear it.  You would take the edge of your ski and behead damn Snickers, right?  I sure would.  Hey, uh.  And bludgeoned him with a bat.  Beat his tail.  You know, speaking of animals, Sarah from Buffalo.  Thank you.  She's a regular to the show as well.  Did you hear what happened in Buffalo with the cat?  Oh, the guy who was going to.  Yeah.  Yes.  Something about the cat pissed off the owner, so the owner decided to put him in his trunk  and started marinating the dirt. 
[00:38:00]  Marinated him.  But I think the cat was still alive as it's being marinated.  Yeah, it was.  And then he was going to go home and fucking cook up his own cat and eat it because he  was pissed off at the cat.  The cat was being a little rambunctious, he said.  And he was marinating the cat and then he was going to eat it.  And he also said the cat was pregnant, but it was a neutered male cat.  Oh, really?  This guy sounds like a kook.  He seems a little kooky.  Yeah.  How do you marinate a cat?  How do you make a cat taste good?  It was in oil.  All right.  With some peppers.  Oh, nice.  And it was like a nice little meat marinade the guy made and put his cat in the trunk of 
[00:38:30]  his car.  He was very angry.  Unbelievable.  This cat, Mr. Snickers.  I hate Mr. Snickers.  There's a news story about Snickers.  Oh, let's see the news story.  Oh, cool.  Tragedy today.  Is it video?  His head was run over by a snowboarder.  Yeah.  You just see a car parked with the fucking flashers going and you know that Mr. Snickers 
[00:39:00]  has wandered onto the street.  Has met his demise.  Let's hear the news.  A porcupine at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center is proving to be more playful than prickly.  Snickers is a five-year-old porcupine who acts more like a puppy.  Ethan Tyler with the Wildlife Center says Snickers was raised by a Palmer family before coming  to the center.  Tyler says visitors are also surprised by Snickers' friendly behavior.  He chases his tail, sits up on his hind legs and loves to have his belly rubbed. 
[00:39:30]  His favorite food is corn on the cob and he eats it by holding it in his hands like a  person.  Tyler says the little guy's behavior is unique.  Snickers is also so domesticated that he cannot be released back into the wild.  For now, he makes a great assistant during presentations about porcupines.  Of course, there were safety gloves on there.  Don't try that at home.  Yeah.  Guys petting him with gloves.  Be careful how you handle the porcupines.  Cute.  Guys petting him.  Ah, ha, ha, cute.  Ha, ha, ha.  Just safety gloves.  Don't try that at home with a porcupine that wanders into your house. 
[00:40:00]  What?  Dumb news.  Who's going to do that?  You know what'd suck?  If you open your refrigerator and there was a porcupine just sitting there eating your food?  How annoyed you'd be?  Like, what the fuck, dude?  You couldn't do anything.  He was eating your cheese and he had shit a lot.  Big nasty cheese shits.  No, but imagine if you looked at it in the porcupine log was the size of like a fucking lumberjack.  What is that?  I don't know.  Sorry.  What happened?  There's a monster on television. 
[00:40:30]  Somebody who's deformed.  He's got some kind of problem.  All access gaming.  He's a gamer, but he's a big, like, fat guy and he's got a problem.  I don't know.  I just caught a glimpse of him and it was like...  There's a monster.  It was a monster.  Oh, we're going to learn how to marinate a cat.  This is Chip in Cleveland.  What's that?  I know, Chip.  Chip.  Hey, yeah, you use cats up. 
[00:41:00]  That's a good one.  Oh, cats.  Wow.  That is a good one, Chip.  It's good, right?  This is terrible.  Porcupines.  I'll show you.  Porcupines upstate New York and Massachusetts.  Also, Pennsylvania and Ohio.  They're everywhere.  Yeah.  There's none in Brownsville.  No.  Or fucking Queens.  Bed-Stuy.  East New York.  Look at this guy.  What's wrong with him?  How can he not move when he's fat?  He's giant.  Oh, my God.  But he likes gaming, I guess.  Look, he could live in another world. 
[00:41:30]  He's probably like a knight.  I know whose suit fits him well.  He's not a big, fat, red-faced man.  Of course not.  They showed the guy.  He's kind of like in a wheelchair.  And his hands look like they're almost taped to something.  He probably has very little mobility.  Yeah.  And he was just gaming gingerly.  You're right.  He probably is a knight.  Oh, he's probably the most suave, debonair character online.  He looked like Chubsy Ubsy from Little Rascals.  Jesus.  Chubsy Ubsy. 
[00:42:00]  In the game, his name is not disgusting.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  Terrible.  B. Hall in Detroit writes, next subject, the platypus.  Yes.  We're going to learn about the platypus next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And his duck bill, yes.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[00:42:30]  There was a hostage situation in Virginia yesterday.  What?  Oh, hold on a minute.  I've been waiting for this moment all my life.  But it's not quite right.  I'm in.  Thanks.  Hmm.  I forgot.  We're going to start doing some vocals.  Yeah.  Silver Sun pickups in the background there.  Very nice. 
[00:43:00]  We got tired of just the music coming around and no words.  Let's say hi to Drew in Virginia.  Drew.  What's going on, man?  Hello.  Your sister was in some kind of hostage situation yesterday.  Well, my friend's sister was.  I was talking to her yesterday, and she's like, oh, by the way, my sister's being held  hostage with a couple of people in a government building.  And why wasn't this on the news?  You know, I'm wondering that myself.  I checked last night and nothing. 
[00:43:30]  Apparently, he was angry about, like, losing his home or not getting some kind of public assistance,  you know, and texting people hostage didn't last long.  He gave up.  But he wasn't checking, and this girl was texting the whole time.  So, guys, you're following this hostage situation, government building, and it's not on the news.  And this guy's a little confused why it wasn't on the news.  Conspiracy.  Yeah.  Why do you think it's not on the news?  Probably because the senator from Alaska is dead. 
[00:44:00]  You know, and one shot.  Why couldn't they do both?  Yeah, they do multiple stories on the news, you know.  Yeah, if there's a hostage situation in a McDonald's, they fucking cover it.  The news isn't one minute.  Yeah, a government building, that would be a big story, don't you think, sir?  Well, you would think, but, yeah, whatever.  You're an ass.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm being mean, Anthony.  And who texted you?  It was my friend. 
[00:44:30]  It was my friend.  We were talking yesterday, and she was mentioning that her sister was being held.  All right, so where's the sister now?  She's at home.  Oh.  So they just let her go?  Well, you know, what happened was, Swat showed up, and the guy, you know, didn't have that  much resolve and just gave up.  Not that much resolve.  What happened to the guy?  No stick-to-itiveness.  Well, obviously he was arrested.  How do you know?  There's no fucking...  Exactly.  What'd you hear about all this?  Yeah.  There's no record of this. 
[00:45:00]  I'm just telling you what I heard.  Let's see.  Was it in Whitpane?  Fairfax.  Fairfax.  Fairfax, Virginia.  All right.  Let's look.  Fairfax.  There's nothing coming up for Fairfax hostage.  Huh.  Huh.  You can't just go, huh. 
[00:45:30]  Well, you know, because I have, like, the reason why I brought it up is she has no reason  to lie to me, so, you know what I mean?  Well, you never know.  Yeah.  But on another note, it's my 30th birthday.  I just have to load in some broad mouth, so, yeah.  It's amazing how you can say so many things that we are not interested in.  I have the top story from the Fairfax Times.  Okay.  Oh, you do.  Happy birthday.  What do you think the top story is?  I'm going to go with...  It's got to be a hostage situation. 
[00:46:00]  I'm going cat in a tree.  It's got to be a hostage.  Go ahead there, Travis.  Retiring Spanish teacher created a recycling club.  Yuck.  Why?  Oh, she needed to.  What's a recycling club?  Just get a bunch of homeless guys.  Ugh.  A recycling club.  That's what they call snowballing cum.  Can you read further there, Travis?  What's the recycling club all about?  Feeling all good about himself.  Nothing worse than the local newspaper.  I mean real local.  The real local. 
[00:46:30]  I mean when you go on vacation and they don't have your paper there and you have to read  some local horseshit paper.  Well, he spent 30 years building the high school's recycling club.  30?  That would take a week.  Do you know what you could do in 30 years?  Exactly.  The research.  Ten-year job three times.  Why did it take 30 years?  I don't know, but the club has gone from a handful of students meeting occasionally after  school to a community-wide effort led by as many as 80 students. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, boy.  So you can see why this is the top story.  Yeah, yeah.  It took 30 years to get it to that point.  Should this guy ever been in trouble for, you know, is there a red pin on a map in a certain  map that this guy's address might be at?  One big distraction.  If he moves, does he have to go to the police and say he moved?  He's just a good guy.  See?  He just loves kids.  He's just a good guy and we have to beat him down.  Ah, stupid recycling. 
[00:47:30]  You don't believe in recycling?  No.  I don't either.  And Keith, the cop, is the worst.  I throw stuff away and he goes through my garbage and goes, what is this doing in here?  It's recyclable.  No, I threw it out.  It's garbage now.  I love how you don't even own your own house anymore.  Oh, I know.  When did that happen?  I don't know.  When did you lose ownership of your own house?  I hear people just come and go.  You're sleeping upstairs.  You don't even know when people are there anymore.  Sleeping upstairs.  Sometimes I'm not even home.  Not even home.  And I pop on. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Or I sleep.  Or I do.  I'm sleeping inside.  And then there's a couple and their wonderful child out my pool.  Really?  Yeah.  I passed out the other day when Travis and Lisa and little Riley were over.  Yeah.  We were over swimming and I walked into Ann's house to get a drink.  I went in to take a phone call.  So I lay down on the couch, took the phone call.  Next thing I know, I'm waking up and there's a text.  Well, didn't want to wake you up from Sleepyville or whatever you put. 
[00:48:30]  Had a good time.  Bye.  Jesus.  I'm not.  I don't have to be a host.  He goes over there to schmooze with the boss and he gets nothing but the shaft.  The boss?  Where was he?  Because I was sleeping on the couch.  Yeah.  I don't care.  People come over all hours.  I could give a shit.  All right.  Hostage situation.  We're going to give it a big thumbs down there, Drew.  We can't find any info.  We found a story about a recycling guy.  That's it. 
[00:49:00]  That's all right.  It's all right, boys.  Happy 30th birthday, though.  What are you going to do for the big three of them?  Yeah.  Well, I already dropped a load, so good to work.  You dropped a load already.  Congratulations, man.  Who was the lucky fellow?  Just a friend of mine.  Ended up fucking here in some alley in Baltimore.  You're just filled with stories.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You didn't have sex in an alley in Baltimore.  You're an interesting fellow.  Why would you just say that?  Because it's the truth. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I've been back home right now.  Why in an alley?  Because we're at a bar, and she has roommates that can't bring people home because she just  has anal roommates.  I don't know.  This seemed like the perfect thing to do at the time.  This seems as detailed as the hostage story.  Yeah.  What do you want to know?  Are you the same person?  Yeah.  We still got the guy on, Jimmy.  I'm sorry. 
[00:50:00]  You can't really take a...  Now he had sex in an alley with a girl.  He's a compulsive liar.  For his 30s.  He's a compulsive liar.  Jimmy just looks up from his iPad.  That's pretty much it.  Compulsive liar.  Compulsive liar.  All right, Drew.  Happy birthday to you, sir.  This guy lies like he works at a rug factory.  Now, Jimmy, is that a stylus for some type of, so you don't goopy up your screen?  My girlfriend bought me an iPad stylus, like a pen, but I don't like it because it's slippery.  Like, I like to hold a pen with... 
[00:50:30]  I'm a grip guy.  I like a pen with it.  I have a very weird way of holding a pen.  Really?  Everybody does.  I can't...  No one holds it properly.  All right.  You are a weirdo.  I squeeze the tips of my fingers really hard when I write.  It's not surprising to anybody.  Angry?  A little anger coming out.  No, but...  I can't do it.  What's the way you're supposed to do it?  I hold mine like this.  No.  Yeah, it's the way you were taught.  And it's a faggot.  You do it the right way.  Yeah, how do you do that? 
[00:51:00]  Doesn't it fall all over the place?  No, it's a very loose...  I very loosely hold it.  Squeeze really tight.  No, because then everything looks like...  My fingertips turn red when I...  Your fingertips are like a millimeter from the end.  Yes.  And they're just turning white.  Your knuckles are white.  Your fingernails are white.  You are squeezing the life out of that pen.  No, because it just hangs on you.  He's cutting off the ink circulation to the tip.  This is exactly how I write.  I don't know why.  I hold it between my...  I hold it against my fucking...  Oh my God, that's even stranger. 
[00:51:30]  No, this is like this.  I have a very light touch.  This is a weird show.  Can you write for a long time, though?  And how we hold pens.  Yeah, because I'm not really, like, gripping very hard.  I can't.  The pen just was all loosey-goosey.  Oh, fuck you, pen.  Loosey-goosey pen.  Yeah, you gotta teach it a lesson.  You gotta hold it.  It's an angry way to hold it.  Yes, you gotta.  You gotta strangle that fucker.  Remember the dumb, retarded kid in school that...  I hope one of you had to do this.  Now that I said it that way.  The little, retarded kid in school that the teacher had to put a rubber band on his pen 
[00:52:00]  because he held it too far down.  So she put a rubber band on it and he couldn't go past the rubber band.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  I remember that kid.  We punched him.  How do I write on this?  What's the matter, Jimmy?  He's having problems with his stylus.  There's a birthday gift, which was noticed yesterday that I hadn't been using it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  I gotta get on the old iPad.  Oh, what did she say? 
[00:52:30]  She'd be going, hey.  You're not using that gift I bought you.  Oh.  There's nothing worse than that.  Oh.  Most people would just be like, eh, whatever.  She doesn't like it, I guess.  But I don't dislike it.  I don't like when I hold it.  If you hold this, it's just a...  Where was the stylus?  Oh, it is a little slippery.  It's a...  Can I see it?  Why don't they fucking...  Why don't they knurl it up a bit?  Because they're assholes.  It is very, very slippery.  Why don't you scratch it up a bit?  Make some grooves in it.  I gotta buy a...  Is there any stylus pen grippers?  Oh, it makes your fingertips dry. 
[00:53:00]  It does, right?  Yes, I hate that.  Yeah, me too.  I need moisture in my fingertips at all times.  Fuck.  Yeah.  You gotta, like...  You gotta fucking bang that up a bit.  No, I gotta buy a piece of rubber for it and smack it around the bottom.  Ba-bing.  Where was the big birthday gift?  You had to find it when she said that?  No, I knew it.  This was from a couple weeks ago.  It's just been sitting there.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Kenny, can you get me a stylus grip for the bottom? 
[00:53:30]  Thanks.  Stylus grip.  Okay.  I'll look for one.  But on the end of it, right, there's a string and, you know, like that little thing that  you'd hang it.  Yeah.  She thought that you had to take this...  How do you just...  Anthony's the best at describing...  There's a string on the end that you would say, uh...  Yeah, it's like a little lanyard for it.  It's like if you had, like, a Christmas ornament, kind of.  Yes.  A little string on the end.  There's a piece of plastic that keeps the string tied on the end.  Mm-hmm.  It's like a little way of dangling you.  It's a little loop. 
[00:54:00]  A loop.  You can hang it on a Christmas tree, basically.  And there's a hard piece of plastic on the end, which keeps the string from coming undone  around the loop.  Uh-huh.  She thought that's what you put on the front of the stylus and write on the iPad with.  I'm like, I'll fucking...  It's a hard piece of plastic, you idiot.  I'll ruin my iPad.  She thought...  You feel that?  That's what she thought I was going to write on my iPad with.  It's like a bee stinger.  She didn't know, Jimmy.  Exactly, but wouldn't she guess a little better?  She was trying...  And she got that for you all night.  Yeah, really, man.  That's very sweet.  I can't fucking use it.  Hey, thanks for the slippery thing. 
[00:54:30]  It's very sweet of her.  Oh, look.  It's slipping out of Jimmy's hands as he tries to scroll with it.  Of course it is.  Why would I be able to grip it?  You're right.  It makes your fingers dry.  It did.  I'm feeling like...  My fingers feel like they've been sanded just from holding that.  What else makes your fingertips dry?  Oh, God.  I can't think right now.  The machine Brundle fly went through.  That's what I'm writing with.  What the fuck is this?  I don't know how to use it. 
[00:55:00]  I'm trying to write on my iPad.  I'm failing miserably.  He's very angry with his stylus.  I'm going to get to the bottom of the hostage story right here, Anthony.  Oh, thank God.  Billy in Virginia.  Billy, what do you got on the hostage situation that guy called in with?  My brother-in-law is a Fairfax County swat, and it was just a drill.  That's all it was.  A drill?  It was just a drill.  Oh, come on.  Oh, well.  That's it, brother.  All right, man.  Thank you.  The guy didn't even know it was a drill.  All right.  Why don't we move on in? 
[00:55:30]  Linda McMahon won the nomination a little less.  Well, she did.  Linda McMahon is now the Republican nominee.  She's going to be running against...  She's a Republican?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's the Republican nominee for the Senate.  Right.  Out of Connecticut.  Imagine that she wins and then tries to shut down wrestling in Connecticut.  Oh, that'd be great.  That would rule.  What the hell do you think you're doing?  Yeah, and she's going to be running probably against some guy named Foley. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Mick Foley?  Mick Foley she's running.  That's a hell of a way to get back at Vince McMahon.  It's just, as Sam said, they're going to try to destroy two Foley's lives.  Jesus.  So, yeah, she's running against...  Sam brought in some audio.  Linda McMahon on Nightline.  She had to deal with some tough questions about wrestlers dying and all that shit.  Really?  All the stuff we've brought up.  They grilled her about it?  All the stuff that would make it a complicated campaign.  Ooh. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, because she was in charge of a company where a lot of young guys died.  All right.  We love the WWE, don't we?  I am very interested.  We have a lot of friends over there still.  Seeing her answers.  Huh?  Interested in hearing her answers.  All right.  Well, Linda tries to justify all of the wrestlers who have died.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Same thing.  Same what?  It's not writing!  Can you...  Oh, you're trying to actually write with it?  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, wow.  Why don't you just use a regular pen?  I know.  I'm going to.  How does that work out?  Terrible!  Oh, God.  Look.  Hi, how are you?  Capital letters.  Here we go.  Oh, God.  Nothing.  Okay.  Why isn't it coming up?  Because it's shit.  Can you do it with your finger?  Yeah.  Your finger works great.  Exactly.  Thanks.  The stylus isn't working.  It's too fat and long and soft.  It's like writing with the eraser.  Yes, exactly.  Here we go.  This.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  Here we go.  What?  This is like writing with the eraser.  And now, can you put that into text?  This is what shows up.  That's what showed up.  Tech has a fire as venti.  This fucking program blows. 
[00:58:00]  Epic fail.  They can't figure out their writing shit yet.  Writing and turning it into text?  Yeah, they can't figure that out yet.  Too many variables on people's handwriting.  I don't mind if it's just his writing, but how about it?  It writes the way it's supposed to.  This stylus is no good.  Yeah.  That's why you should print everything.  I bet you it would be a lot easier.  I am printing.  That looks like you were writing in cursive.  No, I have bad handwriting.  Wow.  You have horrible handwriting.  You do have terrible handwriting.  I thought that was cursive as well. 
[00:58:30]  This is not.  No, that thing isn't going to identify that as not.  That looks like this is me.  Oh, and then it didn't write.  The words aren't showing up.  Oh, no, it's not showing up.  Half the letters aren't showing up.  He has horrible penmanship.  I would love to beat up fucking the technology, but his penmanship is horrible.  How hard do they want me to press?  Look, here you go.  Penmanship. 
[00:59:00]  They are pen-man-ship.  There we go.  And a period.  Dot-sh-p.  It came up as pen-a-pasta.  Oh, Jimmy.  Maybe that program is just not for you.  I don't know.  What happened?  That's a perfect penmanship.  I don't, though, with a fucking fat and dry stylus.  Can you throw the stylus away?  No, I can't.  It will hurt her feelings.  So now you're stuck using the stylus.  I can't use it. 
[00:59:30]  Just so you don't hurt her feelings.  Oh, that stuff sucks.  All right, Linda McMahon on Nightline.  What do you got on this, Sam?  Big wrestling guy?  Well, I just, every time Linda McMahon comes up, you guys point out that they're dead wrestlers.  Yeah, there's a lot of them.  And that's what they pointed out on Nightline.  All right, good.  You see, one of their shrewdest moves was to admit that all of this is a show.  By branding their wrestlers as performers instead of athletes, they avoided costly oversight  and state licensing fees, they ducked any obligation to provide their wrestlers health 
[01:00:00]  care or pensions after their brutally short careers, and congressional investigations  uncovered rampant steroid and drug abuse.  One medical examiner calculates that pro wrestlers die at a rate seven times greater than the  general public.  Why do you think that is?  Of those performers that were under contract to WWE, five of those premature deaths, one  died of an accident, Owen Hart, a tragic accident that we had here. 
[01:00:30]  And then we had, you know, others who've died of natural causes.  While they're in WWE, we absolutely have a health and wellness policy.  I'll probably always say we, even though I've resigned as the CEO.  It's kind of hard to break a 30-year habit.  Once you testified that it wasn't cost-effective to test for steroids among your employees, do  you have any regrets?  There is a doctor that travels with each group.  There are trainers with each group, and all of those measures are to create an environment  for, to protect the health and wellness of these individuals. 
[01:01:00]  Man, she's slick.  She's basically trying to tell everybody that the wrestlers die after they leave the company.  Exactly.  Yeah, they're fine when they're there.  And the other guys, it was natural causes.  Yeah.  Eddie Guerrero, Brian Pillman.  But what they were doing when they were with the company led to their premature deaths  after they got kicked out of the company, Sam Roberts.  The WWE cannot be held responsible for what individuals do once they leave the company.  But she is slick.  Slick.  She's got to be. 
[01:01:30]  Her interview with Nightline continues here.  But beyond the care of her employees, she also faces criticism on the content of their  shows.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The WWE has softened in recent months.  No swearing or blood and less female skin now earns them a PG rating.  But a group called Mother's Opposing McMahon, funded by Democrats, points to old clips that  would make a non-wrestling fan of any party cringe.  They include the beating of a mentally challenged character. 
[01:02:00]  That was Eugene.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even defend that.  They never said he was mentally challenged.  They just said he was special.  Special.  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't actually.  Obviously, he was mentally challenged.  He was goofing on the retarded.  Well, he wears jacket inside out to the ring every time.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he just couldn't get the jacket on.  They include the beating of a mentally challenged character.  Oh, yeah.  The game, yeah, yeah.  And the repeated degradation and abuse of women.  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  The one that struck me was your daughter entering the ring as the crowd chants, slut, slut,  slut, as a mother, was there ever a time when you were sort of creeped out by your own product?  You know, Bill, you have to think about this, WWE, as a soap opera.  It was acting, and WWE is the longest-running weekly episodic program in television.  So, sure, there are storylines that are better than others. 
[01:03:00]  She's got some good people behind her helping her through these tough questions.  Vinnie Mack.  Do you think Vinnie Mack's helping her out?  Yeah.  You think she's going to be backed by people like Bam Bam Bigelow?  Oh.  Bam Bam Bigelow is deceased.  Oh.  What about...  But, again, that was after he left the company.  What about someone like the big boss man is probably going to be her security?  The big boss man could be her security if he hadn't died.  Oh, boy.  After he left the company.  Oh, oh, was.  He left the company.  All right, well, you know who's a big guy that could probably head up her security team? 
[01:03:30]  Who's that?  The British Bulldog.  Well, he was a big guy before he passed away.  What?  After he left the company.  Mr. Perfect?  Is not alive.  How is Mr. Perfect not alive?  He's perfect.  No, he had a heart attack in his 40s.  So his heart wasn't quite perfect.  After he left the company.  I bet Eddie Guerrero is going to really help her out during this election.  Eddie Guerrero is dead, and he died while he was still with the company. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, oh, oh, that's different.  His wife is still in the company.  His wife is still alive.  How about, are they going to use Earthquake for anything?  No, he died.  That was cancer, though.  Oh.  Oh, steroid-induced cancer.  Well, we all know Chris Benoit can't really help out much.  He was crazy, but he was with the company at the time.  Yeah.  Well, bring a lady on board, like the fabulous Moolah.  No, she died. 
[01:04:30]  She was older, but she's dead.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  Hmm.  How about Yokozuma?  Why don't we get Yokozuma up there?  Oh, I remember Yokozuma.  What is he up to?  No, he's dead.  He died.  You know who could bring some sex appeal to the campaign?  Who's that?  Ravishing Rick Rude.  Nice.  Why doesn't she get Ravishing Rick Rude?  Because Ravishing Rick Rude passed away after he left the company.  At the age of what?  He was in his 40s.  All right, how about a little diversity then? 
[01:05:00]  A little diversity by bringing the junkyard dog on board.  He is dead after he left the company, but I think that one was a car accident, so.  Oh.  Can't blame anyone for an accident.  Sure, his vision was probably impaired from all the steroid abuse that the couple looked  the other way at.  Well, it would be nice to get a little sex appeal through Miss Elizabeth, maybe.  Right.  Well, Miss Elizabeth is dead.  What'd she die?  She died, I think it was one of those pill-alcohol combinations. 
[01:05:30]  Hawk from Legion of Doom?  Is also dead.  How about Hercules?  Dead.  Jesus, really?  Wow, I'm trying to...  You think the company knows when these wrestlers are going to die and they fire them because  they don't want them dying as employees?  It's long-and...  How about Crush from Demolition?  Oh, Crush.  Crush is dead.  Oh, shit.  He passed away in his 40s.  Wow.  Your streak is still alive.  You're pretty good here.  Damn.  Just come up with one wrestler that might be alive.  I can't really think of any more that could probably help. 
[01:06:00]  You know, they do offer rehab for free to any wrestler who's with the company or has...  Okay.  Who has ever been with the company.  Quitters.  Renegade?  He's not...  He was never in WWE, but he's dead.  Oh.  He was in WCW, so...  Oh, oh, that's different then.  Exactly.  That I can't, you know.  What about, um...  Adrian Adonis is no longer with us.  What? 
[01:06:30]  How old was he when he died?  I'm not positive, but I would guess late 40s.  Huh.  Huh.  Huh.  Are they all dead?  Oh, my God.  Look at this list of dead wrestlers.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Test is dead?  Test died, yeah.  When did that happen?  Uh, I think a year or two ago.  How did he die?  He was 33.  Yeah.  He took a bunch of pills.  And there was too many. 
[01:07:00]  Oh.  But he wasn't with the company at the time.  Well, at least you could get Adrian Adonis there.  No, no, no, no, no.  We already said he's dead.  And he was 34.  Really?  That was younger than I thought.  But he wasn't with the company.  Ah.  Ah.  Look at all these fucking guys.  It's like a plane crash victim's list.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, God.  I mean, a lot of wrestlers have passed away.  Yeah, they certainly have. 
[01:07:30]  Boss Man.  Big Boss Man at 42.  Yeah.  Mike Awesome at 42.  How about Dino Bravo?  He died, but it was a murder gangland style.  Jesus.  So I don't know what he was involved in.  Kurt Henning, 44.  That's Mr. Perfect.  Right.  When did Dino Bravo die?  That was a while back.  Andre the Giant, 46.  I think, uh...  Hawk is dead.  Could have been 10 years ago.  At 46.  Hawk.  Gone.  And these are only the highlighted wrestlers.  There's a whole bunch of wrestlers that died. 
[01:08:00]  We don't know their...  We just don't know much about them.  Dr. Death recently passed away.  Steve Williams.  The angel of death is dead.  Dr. Williams.  Haystacks Calhoun?  Yeah, he's no longer with us.  He was an older guy, but...  55.  Well, he was also overweight.  That's not an older guy.  Well, I mean, look at the list.  Yeah, compared to the list.  Now we're getting into old age.  Old age.  Meaning 50s for wrestlers.  Oh my God, 60.  It's 61.  Some of these guys made it to 60?  God bless him.  Stan the Manstasiak made it to 60.  Geriatrics. 
[01:08:30]  Do you know Bravo?  I remember him when I was a kid.  Yeah.  I think he was doing drugs or something?  I don't know.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Shocking.  There's some roids.  Yeah, it's got to be the roids.  Here's the last clip from Linda McMahon on Nightlines.  It has a rating for a younger audience now.  Did that have anything to do with your political ambitions?  My political ambitions had nothing to do with that.  The evolution of moving to PG was already underway before I even thought about entering the political arena. 
[01:09:00]  And why?  Because, as I said, it's good business.  Because the audiences wanted that?  Bill, let's take a look at what we're talking about today.  We're talking about my running for the United States Senate.  We can talk about WWE until tomorrow.  But I think the people of our state, and what I hear when I'm around in our state, is not.  They're not concerned about soap opera storylines.  They are concerned about the issues of the day.  They're concerned about the debt, the economy of the country, the jobs that they've lost. 
[01:09:30]  Man, she is smooth, huh?  She was able to just go.  Deflect, deflect, deflect.  You know, if you want to talk about WWE.  Tell the guy's talking about this asshole.  I know, it's true.  Let go.  We know what she does.  It's fake.  It was an act.  Huh?  I don't think she fucking was like, yeah, my daughter's a slut.  It's great when they chant slut, slut, slut when she walks out.  You think they really chained her to the fucking boiler room?  The Undertaker kidnapped her. 
[01:10:00]  The Undertaker kidnapped her.  And they couldn't find her because she was in the basement of the arena.  Yeah.  But the cameraman knew where she was.  Thank God.  Because otherwise it wouldn't have been televised.  Why wouldn't the cameraman tell Vince, who runs the company?  I guess he was.  Guess what?  We found your daughter.  Maybe he was in cahooch with the Ministry of Darkness.  Really?  Why doesn't she bring up the fact, you know, could you please not talk about this?  It makes me feel bad just thinking about my husband blowing up in a limousine.  Right.  I thought he was dead.  Thank God I found out he was just faking it to see if the fans still loved him. 
[01:10:30]  And then she could just lean over and go, get what I'm getting at here, dummy.  Did anybody really believe that he was dead?  I thought he was, but...  Yes.  I don't know.  I guess I might have been the only one.  Well, they brought the FBI in on it for a day until the FBI said, stop using our fucking initials.  Then it was the FIC.  Yeah.  What was it called?  The Federal Investigative Council or something like that?  I don't remember.  Committee, maybe?  Yeah.  Were they all big investigators?  Oh, they were all giant investigators squeezed into suits with gigantic shoulders. 
[01:11:00]  So Dina Bravo was shot by the mafia?  Yes, gangland style.  What happened?  What was the deal with him?  What were you doing?  I don't know.  He was out of...  He wasn't playing ball?  He's out of the business.  He wasn't playing ball?  Let me say hi to Walter in Connecticut.  Do you know more on Dino Bravo's death?  Yeah, he got involved with the underground cigarette trading or something like that.  And the Canadian mafia, they got him in his house. 
[01:11:30]  They shot him like 16 times in the face.  Where did he live?  Wow.  Jesus, really?  The Canadian mafia.  Montreal or something.  The Canadian mafia?  Yeah, the Canadian mafia.  There's one of those.  My eyes itch.  What's that, sir?  He was 44 years old.  And he knew they were coming after him, and he was all paranoid about it.  Locked himself in his house, but somehow they got him, and they shot him like 16 times in the face.  What?  How?  That means somehow they got him.  There was a mafia.  They went into his house.  Yeah.  They got him.  Boy, he's in his house somewhere.  Oh, well, I guess we better go home.  Had he been stealing money from them or something? 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  He got involved somehow with underground cigarettes trading or whatever it was.  He was stealing.  And he just got involved with some bad shit.  That's all.  God.  The cigarette industry.  Yeah.  Two things.  Two birthdays today.  Joe Rogan and Hulk Hogan.  Yeah.  They shot him how many times, sir?  About 16.  In the face.  Yep.  All right.  He was 44 years old.  His real name was Bresciano.  Was thought to have been shot up to seven times with two shots to the head by a gunman 
[01:12:30]  while watching hockey in his vehement Quebec apartment.  It's why they believe that his alleged role in illegal cigarette smuggling in Canada led  to his murder.  A little exaggeration there, my friend.  I'm not exaggerating.  I'm going to go back to what I've heard.  Oh, you heard wrong.  Okay.  I've heard wrong, but you know, whatever.  Varying reports.  And yeah, happy birthday to Joe Rogan, 43 today, and Hulk Hogan, 57. 
[01:13:00]  He's on seven.  He's going to make it to 60, guys, and he's not in the company either.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, Hulk Hogan is struggling.  He's 50, Hulk?  57.  He should have been able to retire by now.  He's in TNA.  He just went blow for blow with Kevin Nash on last week's episode.  He's almost 60, and he's still doing that?  He has to deal with this shit.  Stop it.  He did.  They were going blow for blow.  Kevin Nash tried to land a couple right hands, but couldn't keep up with the Hulkster.  Couldn't keep up with the Hulkster.  Have you seen Hulk walk? 
[01:13:30]  He can't even walk into the ring anymore.  It is difficult.  You see the Hulk recently?  He's just gone.  The poor guy, man.  He shouldn't have to be dealing with that shit at 57.  His dumb wife.  He joined Twitter.  Did he?  Yeah.  He wouldn't come on the show.  What's he going to fucking tweet?  He said brother a whole bunch already.  I bet.  Let me tell you something, brother.  Renna Center.  Austin commercials in TNA. 
[01:14:00]  Let's go to Danny in Staten Island.  He's got something about wrestling.  Danny?  Hey, what's up, boy?  Hey, man.  Hello?  All right.  Me and my buddies, every Sunday, we get a different wrestling DVD.  And the rule is, you got to drink when there's a dead guy on.  So we always get shit-fished.  Yeah, see, Sam.  Yeah, I mean, especially some of the tapes from the 90s or whatever.  You're going to run into a lot of them.  A lot of drinking.  But I don't think that's healthy lifestyle either. 
[01:14:30]  What about Mr. Fuji?  Mr. Fuji's still alive.  I met him at a convention.  He's not doing well.  Yeah?  What do you mean he's not doing well?  Well, first of all, his job right now, since he's out of show business, is that he rips  tickets in a movie theater in Tennessee.  And he's wheelchair-bound.  Oh, God.  Oh, it's horrible.  Why can't they do the right thing?  And he's got shaky hands when he signs things.  You think people recognize him?  All these guys will show the tickets and they tear.  I think they do. 
[01:15:00]  It's embarrassing.  It must be horribly embarrassing.  Although I'm not sure if he has all his facilities about him anymore.  So maybe he's not embarrassed anymore.  He does.  He used to manage the powers of pain.  Now he has a lot of pain.  Oh.  Yeah, now he just rips tickets.  All right, well.  Damn, that's tragic.  Good for Linda McMahon.  She's got a good shot at making it to the Senate.  Oh, she's going to win.  She's going to win in the end.  Yeah.  There's the Hulkster staring down Kevin Nash.  How old's Kevin Nash? 
[01:15:30]  50?  Yeah.  Why does anybody care about these two?  So let me get this straight.  So, because I've been out of the loop for a while.  Sure, yeah, yeah.  So basically, TNA Wrestling is WCW in 1998.  Exactly.  That's awesome.  Maybe I'll start watching.  See Eric Bischoff and...  Yeah.  A small Sting and Jeff Jarrett are there.  So it's all these old guys.  Right.  They got Hulk Hogan to save the company.  And so Hulk Hogan's idea was to hire all the guys that he worked with like 10 years ago  and make them the top guys.  What a dope.  That works well.  Is anybody watching this horse shit? 
[01:16:00]  I check it out from time to time.  It's a small crowd, though.  Look how small that room is.  They record in a...  They do all their TV and most of their pay-per-views in a TV studio in Orlando.  Oh, so it's not arenas or anything.  No, yeah.  They do it at the Impact Zone in Orlando.  How big do you think the crowd is?  It's probably 1,200 people.  Oh, man.  Hulk has really fallen, huh?  Wow.  Can we see some video of Hulk now in TNA?  I would love to just see him.  He's still in shape.  Just being a mess.  Yeah, he's in shape and all that.  But he shouldn't have to be doing this. 
[01:16:30]  No, and his knees are gone.  That wife of his.  His knees are gone.  He's still yelling.  Yeah.  I'm going to out-wrestle you.  Let me tell you something.  What are you telling me?  Kevin Nash had to just kind of act like he was dazed after the first hit because obviously  he could have just hit Hogan back.  It wasn't like rapid fire.  Isn't he actually dazed?  Oh, that was the Hulk's.  Yeah, Ric Flair's back to wrestling in TNA.  Ric Flair's wrestling?  Yeah.  Did he retire?  Yeah, he had the greatest wrestling retirement ever. 
[01:17:00]  And then a year later, he's back to wrestling.  Oh, Hulk's bandana fell off his head.  Uh-oh.  The lights went out in the middle of a great match.  That's something.  He went in half.  How do people have control of the lights?  Like the wrestlers.  Yeah, and the music, too.  I don't know.  Like if it's a surprise.  And what are they all cheering for?  Is an old guy coming?  Oh, man.  Sting, Hulk Hogan, and Ric Flair.  Oh, wow.  This is huge.  It's not huge.  It's the Stinger. 
[01:17:30]  There's a sign that says, this is awesome.  Why is Ben Franklin on the floor of the wrestling ring?  Hulk without his bandana on his head.  Rocking the red and yellow.  Kind of trying to get back up.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I hope you can see him attempt his big boot.  Sting's got, um.  Who, Hulk's big boot?  Yeah, he can't.  Oh, no.  Is he going to try to do the leg?  Oh.  Oh, Hulk's ripping his shirt off.  Sting just turned on Hulk Hogan.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  But he's supposed to be on the same side with him. 
[01:18:00]  Is that Ric Flair you just have out of the ring?  That's Ric Flair.  Ric Flair's tits are giant.  And Ric Flair's had a bunch of matches.  He's wrestling on TV.  He wrestled on TV last week.  Supposedly he still bloodies himself up and everything.  Yeah, he blades all the time.  It's called blading.  Yeah.  Oh, this is fucking horrendous.  Ric Flair has giant tits.  Well, he's an old-looking gentleman.  How come the referee is just standing back waving people off?  Yeah, yeah.  Stop it.  There's a chair in the ring.  Old people getting hit with chairs.  Oh, no.  Not on the Hulk's turf. 
[01:18:30]  You'll hurt him.  Leaving that back open.  Oh, Hulk.  What's the ref?  Oh, right on.  Watch out.  Oh, what's he doing with his hand?  Oh, he's getting a razor blade out of his wristband.  That's what he's doing.  He's fucking cutting himself.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to cut his head.  Do you see him reach for his other wrist?  There he goes.  If you see a wrestler reach for his opposite wrist.  Is Mick Foley part of this?  Yes, he is.  He was, uh...  Can we go rescue him?  Before he...  I don't know what he's doing over there.  They took him off TV for the most part.  He's carving himself up right there. 
[01:19:00]  He's just carving himself.  I think it might have been the chair shot that did that.  Why is there a referee?  I love how there's a referee and he just waves everybody off from the other side.  Wait, is Hulk Hogan's daughter ringside?  Yeah, because his family didn't want him to get back in the ring.  Well, I think they were right.  Oh, no.  She's a terrible actress.  She's trying to look concerned.  His family said,  Hogan, you can't do this anymore.  Dad.  Look, he's bleeding from self-inflicted cuts. 
[01:19:30]  This is what they were afraid of.  Is that Hulk...  He's busted wide open.  He looks like a sad old man.  He is.  It's really depressing.  His daughter's acting is so bad.  She was trying to look concerned.  And Taz is doing the play-by-play.  Oh, yeah.  Taz is a great play-by-play guy.  He's awesome.  He's a good radio host, too.  A great play-by-play guy would be just going,  This is shit.  This is fake.  This is stupid.  As far as that position goes, 
[01:20:00]  Taz always did well.  And he's a friend of the show.  All the old ONA friends are getting lost in TNA.  I don't feel like beating up every fucking person  that's been on our radio show.  I like Taz.  Taz has always been good to us.  Taz is a very nice guy.  Very nice guy.  However...  Does a pretty good radio show.  And as far as being a commentary for wrestling matches,  he was good.  He is.  But what he really should be saying is,  This is terrible.  Did Hulk later take some of the blood from his head  and rub it into his daughter's ass?  I heard he did that.  I don't know.  Like it was some suntan lotion. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know.  And why is Stephanie McMahon now with TNA?  No, that's not Stephanie McMahon.  That's Dixie Carter, the owner of TNA.  Oh, now they're showing Linda McMahon  in a small little window, live talking,  and the giant rest of the screen  is her kicking that gentleman in the bar.  JR on the balls over and over again.  JR on the balls.  Poor JR.  He has really looked like a fool throughout this whole thing.  We got a big Ric Flair fan on the line here.  Oh, really?  Mark in California. 
[01:21:00]  Mark.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Nice, Mark.  Cool.  Listen, if you guys want to see something hilarious,  Flair comes out for his match that night  in a suit, tie, the whole night,  and then he gets stripped,  and you see him wearing these little chonies  that are like multi-colored,  like the grossest thing.  It's the worst thing you've ever seen in your life.  Ric Flair's whole gimmick is that he,  like while he's doing his promos,  if it's a really intense promo,  he'll go so over the top 
[01:21:30]  that he'll start stripping his clothes off,  and then he starts dropping knees and elbows  on his suit jacket.  And they blowed out his ass during the show.  He just gets, he strips down,  he has in the past gone in the ring,  stripped down to his underwear,  and then started performing moves on his pants.  Is he still mad at us?  I'm assuming.  Why would he be mad at us?  Because you made E-Rock and me.  E-Rock and I pretended to be Opie and Anthony.  So, he got his plug out.  I did bad Don Imus impressions.  Don Imus impressions? 
[01:22:00]  Um, you're a jerk.  Yeah, that was it.  Yeah.  He hates us.  Ric Flair hates us.  And my Ronald Reagan, too.  All right.  Do a little Reagan.  Well, that was a great day, man.  Yeah, Ric Flair was never too happy.  I really didn't want to do that.  Being mocked.  My favorite.  No, I didn't want to do that to Ric Flair.  My favorite was when we did that  to the guy with the dumb catch.  David Tyree?  Yeah.  I like doing that one. 
[01:22:30]  Did he get it?  No.  That's when I asked him if his favorite football player was Jerry Dice.  Instead of Jerry Rice.  I started doing Andrew Dice Clay impression.  Oh, right.  You were doing the Dice impression.  Right to his face.  No one gave a shit about his stupid book.  They cared about the catch, but not a whole book about it.  Yeah, exactly.  How could you write a whole book about a catch?  And even the Giants didn't care.  They released him.  What?  The next year?  A guy like that, you let play an extra year or two.  Ric Flair is going to have a massive stroke. 
[01:23:00]  He's got to in the ring.  You just see him yelling, and the veins are...  That's a bad audio clip.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Yeah, when TNA first started, they had a six-sided ring.  Then they hired all these old guys, went to a four-sided ring, and one of the first things  they did is built almost like a wheelchair ramp from the ring entrance up to the ramp, so  the old guys don't have to actually climb into the ring. 
[01:23:30]  They can half-ass run out and just go under the ropes, and it ramps all the way from the  left straight up into the ring.  Oh, they don't have to climb up into the...  No.  Oh, okay.  That's smart.  That's smart.  This is the greatest thing in the world, because TNA used to be like a lot of young guys and  had a six-sided ring and doing weird stuff.  And then Hulk Hogan came in and said, we're going to do different stuff.  We're not going to be like Vince in the WWE.  So he immediately, his idea of changing the business was to go back to a four-sided ring  and to hire all the old guys from WCW. 
[01:24:00]  Very different.  Yes.  Is it doing better now or no?  It's not.  Were you doing better before?  They paid a whole bunch of money for Hulk Hogan, and they're in about the exact same  spot that they were in.  Just a bunch of people from Florida who won't give up on TNA.  What a wreck.  All right, and finally, Andy in Boston.  Andy.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Long time listener.  Hey, Sam, I got two questions for you.  Ultimate Warrior, is he dead? 
[01:24:30]  He's not dead.  A lot of people think he's dead, and that there was a second Ultimate Warrior.  That's not the case.  They hate him?  Everyone hates him?  Yeah, the Ultimate Warrior is...  They made a whole DVD about how bad he was.  Was he a bad wrestler or a bad guy?  He was a bad wrestler and a bad guy.  Hey, I'm getting something on Twitter.  For the best thing ever in TNA, look up Scott Steiner, best promo ever.  Oh, yeah, I've seen that one.  Is it good?  Why is that good?  It's great.  It says, with subtitles.  You need the subtitles.  Why is that great? 
[01:25:00]  Well, Scott Steiner...  Thanks, Andy.  He sometimes gets ahead of himself.  He just starts shouting.  What a bunch of buffoons these guys are.  They're calling this the best promo ever?  Yeah.  That's Scott Steiner, the first one, isn't it?  Yeah, but it's not TNA.  Is Mean Gene in TNA?  No, that's not Nitro.  Try this one.  It's TNA.  Oh.  Oh.  Scott Steiner, it's going to be a three-way for the TNA heavyweight title at Sacrifice 
[01:25:30]  between you, Kurt Angle, and Samoa Joe.  Now, before you get there, you have an important step tonight as you and X Division champion  Petey Williams take on the unlikely duo of Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe.  You know, they say all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe  and you can see that statement is not true.  See, normally if you go one-on-one with another wrestler, you've got a 50-50 chance of winning.  But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal. 
[01:26:00]  So you've got a 25% at best at beating me.  And then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastically go down.  So the three-way at Sacrifice, you've got a 33 and a third chance of winning.  But I, I've got a 66 and two-thirds chance of winning because Kurt Angle knows he can't  beat me, and he's not even going to try.  So Samoa Joe, you take your 33 and a third chance, minus my 25% chance, and you've got  an eight and a third chance of winning at Sacrifice. 
[01:26:30]  But then you take my 75% chance of winning.  If we go one-on-one and then add 66 and two-thirds chance, I've got a 141 and two-thirds chance  of winning at Sacrifice.  See, Joe, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice.  See, but I'm going to break it down for you, Nate.  Would you rather be with me, or would you rather be with Joe?  Well, I think Joe's kind of nice. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, you know?  See, you're one of those girls that like romance.  I'm going to talk to all my freaks out there.  Would you rather come home to me, a genetic freak, to be satisfied every night, or go  home to that fat-ass Samoa Joe?  See, tonight, we're going to win, and I'm going to be the world champion at Sacrifice.  Come on, Pete.  Let's go.  Scotty, just like you always say, big pop-a-pump has got your hookup.  Well, Maple Leaf Muscle is who you need to look up.  Holler if you hear that. 
[01:27:30]  What?  Nice.  Who won that match?  They're both retarded.  I don't know that match specifically, but he didn't go on to win the world title.  Oh, but he had a percentage thing.  It was like over 100%.  Can I look at best promo ever?  Maybe the guy just had the company wrong, because now I'm curious why they would label it best  promo ever.  Scott Steiner has a lot of flubs.  How old is that promo?  It's probably two years old.  Yeah, big pop-a-pump.  He's your hookup.  Holler if you hear me. 
[01:28:00]  This is the BCW World Heavyweight title, and I know for a fact you're not going to lay down  for this guy.  That's what, Mean Gene, I don't lay down for nobody, and whether I leave here a world  champion tonight, it don't matter, because it's not going to change my focus on getting  even with Goldberg, a fraction in my face, and a fall ball.  Goldberg, I'm going to get even if we do, a fraction in my face, and I'm going to prove  to you that I'm the man with the largest arms in the world.  I'm the generic freak, and size does matter.  But that statement, Mean Gene, comes true whether I'm in the ring, or I'm in the ring. 
[01:28:30]  See, when I have my freaks horizontal, they understand size, they appreciate size, and  size does matter.  And they know that they don't have to wait for the Earth to rotate on a 47-degree axis so  the stars can touch the sky, and create an equal act, so they can see the Big Dipper.  He drinks a lot.  All you got to do is call me Papa, because I'm the man with the Big Dipper, and satisfaction  is coming when I go behind and do the bump and grind, and it's only a matter of time because 
[01:29:00]  they call me the Big Bad Booty Daddy.  So, Goldberg, realize this, I only care about two things in this world, my freaks and my peaks,  and when I beat your bald ass down, I fall ball, and I'm going to have to put you in the  He is so roided out, this guy.  Eric and me...  That's a big pop-a-pomp.  Eric and me met Mean Gene when we went to Orlando for WrestleMania, and they had like a...  Was that with the meat martinis? 
[01:29:30]  That was the same event, yeah.  Same event with the meat martinis.  Don't forget Iraq.  Iraq loved the meat martinis.  Didn't he have two of them?  At least two.  I think he had three or four.  Yeah.  But, yeah, there was some radio people party that they had some of the guys go to, and  Mean Gene was there.  And he ended up just getting hammered and hitting on every girl in radio.  Really?  All these fat girls were getting hit on by Mean Gene.  He's drunk all of his ass.  Is he still with Vince's organization?  No.  No, he does like...  Maybe behind the scenes. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, he comes in and does little special things.  He doesn't, like, stuff for their on-demand network or something.  How much bad breath he must have smelled?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  As they're just yelling into his face.  Angry with the fucking spittle breath.  Yes.  Roid breath.  Drive roid breath.  Drive roid breath.  He probably got a lot of spit on him, too.  Lots of spittle.  Do you think he's rich?  Mean Gene?  He's probably not rich.  He's probably fine.  He's comfortable.  I'd say they paid him just enough. 
[01:30:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, he's not a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  He never made a million bucks a year.  No.  Fuck, he's a legend.  I know he is.  What did he used to do?  I don't know.  Well, he's doing a...  He can't be a millionaire because he's doing a convention at the end of September somewhere  in Jersey, in a cafeteria.  Come on.  You're telling me that guy isn't roided out?  Big pop-a-pump.  Look at his bicep.  There's an aorta running through it.  All he cares about is...  That is a fucking tunnel.  ...his freaks and peaks.  Freaks and peaks.  Right.  Right. 
[01:31:00]  He works out.  He's like Steve.  Who's that guy?  That's his brother, Rick Steiner.  Oh.  All right, right, right.  Someone said you've got to look up the promo where he talks about Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  Yeah, I've seen that one.  Why is that one good?  He's talking about Hiroshima.  What does he know about it?  He doesn't know.  He's obviously a buffoon.  He's an idiot.  He's talking about numbers for 10 minutes a minute ago.  Oh, it was great.  I was trying to do the math along with him. 
[01:31:30]  Does he still wrestle?  Very difficult.  Not at the moment, but...  Why?  What happened?  Once...  He's cycling out right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to cycle or your balls dry up.  Right.  He was phased out in the Hulk Hogan regime of TNA.  Ah.  Sorry to see him go.  I want to see Hulkamaniac doing a promo.  The new Hulk.  The 57-year-old Hulk.  Does he still do them?  Every week on Impact.  I'm coming for you. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  He runs TNA and he runs it with an iron fist.  Does he?  Oh, he lets people know that he's not the type of boss that you're going to push around.  Oh, yeah?  Like in his marriage?  Oh.  As he's passing by his house crying?  Yeah.  He runs out with an iron checkbook.  Oh, this is good.  This is him inspiring.  He sees abyss as the next big thing.  So he's inspiring.  Where can you find ingredients?  Well, that's a McDonald's cover.  It doesn't sound like Hulk.  No.  I don't call it McDonald's.  I have another word for it. 
[01:32:30]  I have a feeling that the McDonald's part is there, but the first couple letters are different.  Yeah.  It's just my observation.  That's all.  All right.  Hulk Hogan.  That's abyss.  That's McFoley.  I know he looks like McFoley, but it's abyss.  Do I try to do what you told me to do?  McFoley's got to be pissed.  I'm in trouble, Mr. Bishop.  McFoley's fucking pissed.  Yeah.  They did a thing with him and McFoley once.  McFoley got the TNA.  I'm done with this crap.  Look at you.  Sit down.  Yes. 
[01:33:00]  Not now, Eric.  Get out.  Oh, man.  Get that clip.  Eric's nightmare.  Hulk Hogan yelling at him.  I am so sick and tired of watching you chase your tail.  I am so sick and tired of watching you be afraid of your own shadow.  Now, right now, it stops.  It's over.  It's a done deal.  Do you understand that?  Yes, sir.  Okay, brother.  Let me explain it so you can understand it. 
[01:33:30]  Do you know who Superman is?  Yes, sir.  He's got a cape.  Yes.  It makes him real powerful.  Do you know who Popeye is?  Yes, sir.  He's got that yada canvas.  It makes him real, real strong.  I'm going to ask you a question.  Are you really a monster?  Yes, sir.  I am a monster.  No, are you a monster?  Yes, sir.  I am a monster.  Oh, you're not as big of a monster as I am, brother, because the monster that I am is  called Hulkamania.  Yes, sir.  It's bigger than you could ever be.  It's bigger than you understand that.  Yes, sir, I do. 
[01:34:00]  It all stops now.  Oh, my.  You will never cower again.  You will never shake.  You will never back up, brother.  Look at this.  Do you know what this is?  Make somebody drink it.  Yeah, do you know what this is?  This is Hulk Hogan's Hall of Fame ring, brother.  This is my life.  Everything.  Yeah.  This is everything.  This is the only thing that my wife didn't get.  This is the only thing that ever loved me. 
[01:34:30]  I destroyed my body for 30 years, selling out every huge venue in the world to earn this  ring.  These are extensions.  I'm so crumpled up, I can barely get out of the bed.  You're running a broom.  Do you understand that this is my life?  Yes, sir.  This is my life.  I understand, Hulk.  You understand.  Yes, sir.  I do.  It's everything that encompasses Hulkamania and the world.  I understand it.  Put your hand out. 
[01:35:00]  One ring.  Put your hand out.  Rule them all.  Yeah.  This is yours.  What?  What's this guy's fucking gimmick?  He's a monster, except he became insecure for a time.  The power of the universe.  This will make you the strongest mortal man on this earth.  Oh, really?  This will be good to you.  This will protect you.  It makes you need a good lawyer, pussy whipped.  This will love you.  This will guide you.  You're going to lunge it into your daughter's crack.  We'll make you the god of wrestling. 
[01:35:30]  You will be, from this point forward, ten times a man, ten times the wrestler, ten times  stronger than Hulk Hogan ever was.  Yes, sir.  Can we pause this?  Sam needs more bagel plates.  That is your destiny.  Yes, sir.  You will become the god of men.  The man that I could never be.  You will be greater than anything that's ever walked in the ring.  Yes, sir.  That is your destiny.  Yes, sir.  Do you feel the power?  I feel it, Hulk.  I feel it. 
[01:36:00]  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  It's amazing how much these guys can yell.  I won't let you down, Hulk.  Yeah.  Is he like Gollum with the ring now?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  He just puts the ring on and freaks out.  It's Hulk's cock ring.  It stands for every Hulkamaniac in the world ever. 
[01:36:30]  Hulkamaniac.  Now it stands for the monster abyss.  He's just talking to himself, by the way.  What is he doing?  I don't get that.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.  Are you embarrassed?  Yes.  It's terrible.  Even from a whole different perspective, what's great about that whole angle is that that's  a WWE Hall of Fame ring.  Yeah.  So this whole bit that they're doing, all it's doing is pointing out that the WWE is the 
[01:37:00]  greatest place ever and TNA is small potatoes.  Right, because that's the most powerful ring ever.  Right.  What a great screamer Hulk Hogan is, though.  His fucking pipes are amazing.  Dude, if I do fucking Ted for too long, it hurts.  That fucking guy just screamed for eight minutes.  That's the power of Hulkamania.  Ah, that is.  Hulkamania.  Is running wild.  Does that mean Gene?  No, that's Tony Schiavone.  Someone is saying, play the clip where McFoley calls out the abyss. 
[01:37:30]  It was totally real.  McFoley can't be allowing that to happen.  Well, there is a...  That's McFoley.  They did a gimmick where it was...  That was Mankind.  ...McFoley and Abyss, like, feuding.  Right.  And McFoley did a couple promos where he kind of really went after him for completely  ripping off his gimmick.  Yeah, it's his fucking thing, man.  Can we see that?  Because I never saw McFoley do promo.  I only know him from here.  McFoley was great.  He's a good promo guy.  Is he?  I never saw him wrestle. 
[01:38:00]  Does your ride come with this?  It doesn't sound like McFoley.  Fucking commercials.  Commercials on the internet.  Oh.  On the inner tubes.  I guess it beats us having to pay for shit, but...  Yeah, well, you know.  Enough.  It takes forever.  What are you gonna, you know...  Why don't you write something with my dry pen?  Yeah, take your dry pen.  Fucking dry stylus.  Ugh.  Is it because you just don't like it getting greasy?  I don't know.  We should drag this pen through the fucking gulf.  Soak up all the oil. 
[01:38:30]  The doctors have said that I cannot compete tonight.  It's a bish again.  Yeah.  But I need answers.  Mick Foley.  I need answers.  You owe me that, Mick.  I hate this guy.  You owe me.  Yeah, he's corny. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, he sucks.  Yeah, he's really corny and just stupid.  He's like one of five guys that actually came from TNA, not from another place.  Yeah.  What else do you think?  We want answers.  We want answers.  Oh, no.  We want answers.  We want answers.  What?  Is he there?  That's Mick Foley's music.  I wouldn't know that because I don't do this.  I have no idea.  We got to get special ops to fucking rescue him. 
[01:39:30]  Special ops.  He's a good fucking friend of the show.  He doesn't need to keep putting up with this shit.  Why is he going in as dude love?  No, he's just wearing his tiger shirt.  He's got a barbed wire back.  It's not a dude love move.  He's attacked a bit with, a little curious also, why security is towing behind Mick Foley.  Think of the divergent message that Mick Foley is sending.  I don't think that.  He's signed on his shirt.  No. 
[01:40:00]  Barbed wire baseball bat in his hand.  True.  Getting a mic already.  Hold on there, Bist.  I just hear you saying that I owed you, you who've taken so much from me in terms of your career and your look and your persona.  You feel like I owe you. 
[01:40:30]  What exactly do I owe you for, Chris?  Do I owe you for the 24-plus years of blood, sweat, and tears that I've dedicated to this business?  A small crowd.  Oh, I know.  Do I owe you for paving the way for guys like you to make a living?  Do I owe you for the flannel shirt I presented so you could carry on my hard work tradition? 
[01:41:00]  Can we rewind that a little bit?  That never happened.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Well, there's not a lot of people.  Oh, no.  The applause didn't come.  Yeah.  I mean, it probably would have been there in the garden.  Do I owe you for paving the way for guys like you to make a living?  Do I owe you for the flannel shirt I presented so you could carry on my hardcore tradition? 
[01:41:30]  No, no.  I'm sorry, Chris.  As far as me owing you, that's just not going to happen.  Mick, I want to make one thing clear.  Yeah?  All I was trying to do was save you against Kevin.  I didn't know what he was going to do to you.  I came to the ring to save you. 
[01:42:00]  I think one guy is better than the other.  This is such a sight.  And as far as far as the sweet and sweet connection picture goes, that Mick, that was an accident.  I went into your office, Mick, to get the barbed wire back to help save you.  Does Mick hit him eventually?  Can I accidentally...  This is a really long clip. 
[01:42:30]  It's fucking endless.  It takes forever.  That fucking...  We get it.  That's not moving too quickly.  No, it's ten minutes long.  No.  Fuck that.  Do you think they know when it's bombing?  Oh, yeah.  Of course they do.  Yeah, when they look out at the crowd and there's no one there.  They know it's bombing when they pull up to the arena.  Do you think this is bombing?  Yes.  It's really...  This is horribly bombing.  It's just copy.  You're a cheap, low-rate Mick Foley wannabe! 
[01:43:00]  I want to be, Chris!  I want to be!  I want to be!  Oh!  Mick looked at the picture of his head, Matt.  That was no peace offering.  Wow.  Good.  Excellent.  Excellent today.  Well, Mike, I'll tell you, I get the feeling TNA is about to experience a Mick Foley this  company has yet to see.  Oh, really?  It's Taz.  This company.  And as Foley goes to leave the impact zone with his security crew, here comes the monster! 
[01:43:30]  Oh, boy!  Oh, boy!  Woo!  Whoa!  Oh, he's taking out the security.  Oh, shoot.  Well, since when does Mick Foley need security anyway?  Yeah, exactly.  Good call, Taz.  Foley using that security as a shield to escape.  But security's not going to escape.  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Ow!  That has to hurt. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, and I was running after Mick.  Why is Mick running away?  Well, that's why that was...  That gimmick thing...  Whoa!  That's why that didn't bomb, because now they're booing Mick Foley.  So he successfully made a heel turn just then.  Is that what it was, a heel turn?  That's what that was.  But how do you become a good guy again?  Baby face.  Baby face.  That's a baby face.  He's a good guy.  A baby face.  How do you do that again?  To become a face, he would have to...  You could do it overnight. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  You just got to do something that people go, yay!  He could fight Abyss, right?  And then Abyss beats him.  And then he stands up and shakes his hand and says, you're not a Mick Foley ripoff.  That's a face turn.  And the crowd loves him.  That's a face turn.  But do they really get...  Well, they really boo...  Or they kind of get the gag that they're supposed to boo him.  No, they don't get anything.  Yeah, there's a lot...  Especially since they're all Florida wrestling fans.  They're all retarded in the crowd.  Hey, Mick ain't doing the right thing!  Yeah, yeah.  Can you believe what we just saw?  Hey, it went to the picture! 
[01:45:00]  And they analyze it like people analyze sports.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, Mick Foley's good.  But if Mick ran away, look at him.  He's using security guys.  He's not the same Mick he used to be.  He used to use security guys.  If you would have told me Mick was using security, I'd probably go, what?  Oh.  Wow, that's terrific.  All right.  We should take a break, get into some other things.  How did this start?  Linda McMahon, I guess.  Yeah, you're talking about Linda McMahon.  It's all over TV today.  That's it.  Winning her primary, so...  Oh, sorry. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  We went a little over budget on talking about wrestling, I guess.  I didn't think so.  Ah, well, no.  Some people, that'll just get bounced for a little while for complaining.  I don't like complainers.  Me neither.  You know the show is all about just wherever it goes?  Yeah.  Wherever it goes, it goes.  It goes.  So what?  You a little upset?  I don't care.  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony Show on The Virus, Sirius XM. 
[01:46:00]  The Orange Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Remember?  Just for having me.  I was so young in history, and I wouldn't remember.  I'm waiting for it.  I guess I'm still alive.  Even if I don't seem to feel me up with that line. 
[01:46:30]  We're rocking.  Tool.  Is that the video?  Yeah.  Tool made some fucked up videos, huh? 
[01:47:00]  Great.  Twisted.  Scary videos, man.  All that wacky animation.  Good shit.  Yeah, I like Tool.  Tool.  How long have these guys been around?  A while now.  God.  I want to say...  Early 90s.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to say 15 years.  Wow.  God, it's been that long.  Probably. 
[01:47:30]  I tried saying 90 on the dot.  90?  So, they're celebrating 20 years.  God damn it.  Unbelievable.  Opian, Anthony.  Time flies.  Hey, we got the correctional officer being tased after DUI.  Yeah.  Video's huge online.  Basically, the story goes, Barry Mulcahy looks like, right?  49, a high-ranking Vermont corrections official, and the Waterbury Academy's top administrator  in charge of training prison staff, were driving all over the road on Route 7 in Brandon, Vermont. 
[01:48:00]  Oops.  When Mulcahy refused to cooperate in the...  Mulcahy was drunk?  Mulcahy was drunk.  Wow.  Refused to cooperate in the Brandon Police booking area.  He was hit with a five-second taser burst.  So, what's great, though, this guy is a tough guy.  Tough cookie?  And let everyone have it.  And then said, all right, tase me.  Oh, boy.  Well, Barry, do you want to fucking play it?  I'll give you the option. 
[01:48:30]  Okay?  Yes, sir.  Because I'll...  Listen.  We on tape?  We on tape?  Yes, sir.  Okay.  What I have to do...  Because I've had about enough of your fucking bullshit for one night.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  Well, if you want to do fingerprints for...  No, I'd like to fucking hammer fist you right here, right fucking now.  You play your little fucking games with me.  They're right on the other side of the door, how you want to fucking play it. 
[01:49:00]  What are you talking about, Barry?  What's Barry talking about?  He's drunk.  Hey, I have a job to do.  Yes, sir.  I can request that you come back?  Yes, sir.  Okay?  That's what you want to do?  Is that what you want to do?  Yes, sir.  Barry is a tough guy, man.  Barry's drunk.  Barry is drunk.  You could hear Barry is drunk.  But he's a high-ranking Vermont corrections official, though.  Yeah? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, so he's got some cred.  He'll lose his job after this, though.  Yeah, it's going to be bad.  Barry, you think he gets madder?  Yeah.  I think he apologizes for his...  All right.  Barry, how do you want to play it?  Barry, I'll play it however you want.  Do you want to play it however the fuck I want it?  Let's go that way.  How can he fucking...  Oh.  You want to play it?  That way.  Three against one.  It's just going to make it worse. 
[01:50:00]  Assault on a P.O.  It's just going to make it worse.  Son.  You boys.  Barry, we know the job you do, and we respect the job that you do.  Yeah?  You need to respect the job.  And that's why you just fucking dragged me through the fucking mud.  That's why you just put my fucking career on the line.  27 fucking years.  You sons of bitches.  Let's go.  How many of you do?  You tell me.  You fucking tell me.  Do you want to go home?  There ain't no fucking home from here, son. 
[01:50:30]  You want to know how we fucking play it?  You want to sit on the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council?  Step back.  You want to fucking...  No.  You want to do what I fucking do?  We're giving you a shot to go home.  You're giving me a fucking shot to go home.  With a fucking DUI on my record.  Violation of the 13 work rules of the Vermont Department of Corrections.  You sons of fucking bitches.  You're giving me a shot. 
[01:51:00]  How many of you took a fucking shot you want?  Oh, man.  He is not a happy guy right there.  Well, because he knows...  He knows.  He's going to fuck up his career.  He pretty much fucked up here.  Blaming it on them.  I wonder why they didn't give him a pass.  I don't know.  Law enforcement courtesy, kind of a, hey, I'll drive you home kind of thing.  Do cops break each other's balls for DUI, or maybe they had to.  Maybe it was a stop or a checkpoint or something.  I would imagine rarely.  I mean, you've got to really fuck up out there, I'm thinking. 
[01:51:30]  He might have jumped on them, you know, right away.  Yeah, I don't know the whole back story, right.  Pulling that whole, you don't do this to me shit.  Right.  Well, and then this happened.  You want a shot?  Take it.  Barry, get down on the ground now.  Get down on the ground now.  Barry, we're going home.  Barry, you're going to move to the officer, Barry.  Barry, you're going to move to the officer, Barry.  Sir, listen to me. 
[01:52:00]  Roll over.  Are you going to do it, Barry?  Roll over.  Roll over.  Put your hands behind your back.  You want it again?  Roll over.  That was nice.  That was nice.  We got it.  Straight arm.  Arm work.  Arm work.  Taked out.  Yeah.  Pass your hand.  You had your chance to go home.  Pass your caution.  You blew it.  You had your chance.  And then he's giving a play-by-play of what they're doing. 
[01:52:30]  Nice, nice.  Arm bar takedown.  Nice.  Did that correctly.  Good.  He just got tased and he's laying there fucking taunting them.  That's a tough motherfucker right there.  There it is.  Stupid, but tough.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  NYPD on the line.  Oh, Ari.  What's up, Ari?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  You're on the air.  Ari, let's go, brother.  What's up? 
[01:53:00]  You're on the show, bro.  You're on the air.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, go ahead.  Now that we got that out of the way.  Yeah, no problem.  I'm not helping you.  What's that?  Don't you, um...  Ari.  Didn't you call the radio show, right?  You got a phone in your hand, right?  Yeah.  What are you doing with the phone?  At the moment, I'm talking to you.  Yeah, don't listen to the radio, first of all. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I know.  I'm not listening to the radio.  I just heard me in the background.  All right, so why did you call?  Terrific.  You're listening to the radio.  And you said you weren't listening to the radio.  The radio's off.  Well, what am I hearing?  Then who are you listening to?  Nothing at the moment.  Okay, but how come the...  Why did you call?  Because you guys are talking about this amazing video,  and somebody asked about why it wasn't there.  So before you even get to that, 
[01:54:00]  how come when we said,  hey, Ari,  and you have a story,  why didn't you just start talking?  Well, I thought I was going through to somebody  who was going to be screaming the calls.  Didn't you already talk to a screener?  No, I did not.  Travis, how do we know your name  and where you're from  and what you want to talk about?  I think I'll just punch out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're not getting off that easy.  I started the call by going, 
[01:54:30]  NYPD, Ari on the line.  Remember that part?  So you told somebody your name, right?  Yeah.  And you told them where you're from  and what you do  and what you want to talk about, right?  Right.  That's called screening.  Correct.  And then the next person  you will talk to after screening  is us on the air,  which is right now.  Who else would you talk to?  I didn't know who.  I didn't realize it.  Let me ask you.  Yeah.  How many times in court 
[01:55:00]  has a defense attorney been questioning you  or the judge just threw the case out?  I think Ari gets a free DVD.  You think?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  For one of those failed series?  Oh, of course.  He's got to get one of the shittiest DVDs.  Steve, what do we got?  Steve, what do we got for this?  You want real or you want...  One of the worst fucking...  Give me a sec.  I'll go check.  One of the worst fuck-ups in call history.  What were you going to say?  You want real?  Do you want, like...  Do you want decent  or do you want crap? 
[01:55:30]  You don't have decent.  I got...  I got to escape from New York.  Crap or crappier.  Steve.  Yeah.  Steve.  Yeah.  If we're going with the bit, the guy is horrendous.  Why would we want to give him something good?  Because we gave him good the last time.  That was because we flipped it.  What's the worst DVD you have back then?  And the guy hung up.  The Tom Selleck one.  Tom Selleck.  The Tom Selleck one.  Ari, you're going to win a Tom Selleck.  No, he's going to win nothing because then he copped out.  Oh, did he?  He's...  Ari, fucking call back and take your beating.  Fuck him. 
[01:56:00]  What was that?  Blood Creek.  Swastika.  Oh, there's a swastika.  In the 30s, Adolf Hitler believed the occult held the secret to immortality.  Almost a century later, the nightmare has awakened.  Oh, well, I might have to see this.  That clue's not...  All right, listen.  We got another NYPD guy on.  This is Mike in Queens.  Mike.  Mike.  Am I...  Am I...  Do I talk now?  Do I...  What a fucking retard he makes all the cops sound like. 
[01:56:30]  You never want...  You never want the guy on the Opie and Anthony show looking like an idiot and he does the  same profession as you.  Oh, it's so embarrassing.  You say your name, where are you from?  You hear the...  And then you start talking.  There you go.  That's fucking hard, Ari.  All right, what...  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to punch it out.  Oh.  And then he...  But you weren't going to be the one.  Has a banner call.  And then they listen to them.  I've so had it. 
[01:57:00]  I can't stand the callers.  But we wanted a policeman's point of view today.  Yeah, a point of view on busting another cop or someone else in law enforcement.  Right.  Especially for a Dewey.  You give them the courtesy as long as they're not running over women and children as they're  drunk driving.  If you pull them over and he blows over the limit, what's the criteria there?  For helping them out as a professional law enforcement courtesy? 
[01:57:30]  I know you're not supposed to.  Or, you know, maybe he calls someone and drives them home.  You give them a little more time to fuck it or something.  But what is it that he has to do that makes you go, well, come on.  You're coming in.  All right.  I guess we're not going to get the answer because Ari panicked.  Police say Mulcahy had an open beer in the car, admitted he had consumed 12 beers and  predicted his blood alcohol would be two and a half times the legal limit for DUI.  Oh, he refused? 
[01:58:00]  Police never found out because Mulcahy refused to provide a breath sample in the booking area.  And when officers offered to drive him home, Mulcahy challenged him to a fight.  All right.  So I wonder if they were going to charge him.  What do you think?  What do you make of this, Kenny?  Oh, Kenny, maybe.  I could offer an opinion.  All right.  An opinion.  Yeah.  What do you think?  It's been my experience.  Personal experience?  That the brotherhood is dwindling.  Oh, really? 
[01:58:30]  It's not what it used to be.  There's a lot more artificial camaraderie now.  Really?  Yeah.  Tell us about back in the day.  Back in the day.  Maybe something you heard.  We stuck together like glue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You got an example of that?  There was a thick blue line.  Yeah.  A thick blue line.  Yeah.  Now there's like a thin blue line.  What about this guy where they offered to drive him home and he was being a...  Well, you know, everybody hates cops.  So, you know, right away, you're off to a bad start. 
[01:59:00]  That's why, you know, cops generally try to, you know, they got to look out for themselves  because nobody else is looking out for them.  Mm-hmm.  You know, so, I've heard.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Like, say, for instance, if a cop, like, had a DWI, a drunk driving incident.  Yeah.  You know, and maybe he had an accident.  Uh-huh.  Like, say, for instance, if, like, that cop just, like, hit a pole.  Right.  And, like, didn't, like, hurt anybody but himself.  Hypothetically speaking. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Hypothetically, maybe back in the day that could be, like, washed.  Washed.  How do you wash something like that?  Yeah.  You put the bark back on the tree?  It's like a do-over.  It's like, you know, we're willing to forget about it if you are.  A do-over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But how do you clean up the accidents?  Yeah.  Well, the guy, you know, you write up the accident.  Right.  Oh.  As an accident.  Yeah.  As an accident.  You know, an animal ran in the roadway.  Of course.  You had to swerve to avoid the animal. 
[02:00:00]  Accidents happen.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why they're called accidents.  Yeah, yeah.  Not on purpose.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you, like, you know, being on duty and then, like, you get called to, like,  a bar fight or, like, a domestic boyfriend-girlfriend, whenever there's, like, an off-duty cop involved,  it's, like, always a problem.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because, you know, usually the off-duty guy's drunk.  You know?  And it's like, you know, the last thing you want to do, you know, you just, like, tell the 
[02:00:30]  guy, like, you know, let's get out of here, forget about it, like, let's, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just try to adjust it at the scene, and they're, like, you know.  So no one creates, no problems are created for people in the brotherhood.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you got to keep everything on the down low.  But now, today, there's cameras everywhere.  Yeah, that's true.  You could jam yourself up if you take care of somebody and it's caught on camera.  Yeah, and not only that, like, say, for instance, we was all on a job together. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  And, like, one guy did something inappropriate, and, like, the two, three other guys, like,  stood by.  Do you have an example of that, maybe?  Maybe something you heard?  Like, you know, after a car chase, like, the adrenaline's going.  This is just for the radio.  I mean, you got to paint the picture.  It's all hypothetical.  So people understand what you're talking about.  Yeah, the adrenaline's going, and the car chase.  Yeah.  And then, like, they finally do that Pittman move where they hit the back of the car and  make him spin around. 
[02:01:30]  Spin him around.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, like, you know, ten cops converge.  They drag the guy out of the passenger window.  Draw him on the ground, you know.  There's a little fisticuffs, you know.  And then, you know, the helicopter camera's there or some camera's there, you know.  And then, you know, one cop, like, did the beating, and, like, the three cops, like,  didn't stop him or, like, you know.  Ah, so there's a problem.  Yeah, so, like, they get in trouble by proxy. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because they, like, condone that activity.  Ah, that ain't good.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  So the point is, if you're going to do something dirty, you got to do it by yourself.  No witnesses.  No other people around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No one else involved.  Because if one other person knows, it's not a secret no more.  Because it's a thin line now.  Yeah, yeah.  The line is too thin.  Camaraderie's not what it used to be.  Oh.  All right.  So what do you think happened?  Why did this guy, I mean, this camera's in the police station, so you think they wanted 
[02:02:30]  to just take this guy home when he was being a dick?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, like, the details of this particular story, but in general, it's very hard to shit  can things these days.  Shit can things?  Yeah.  Let's shit can it.  Yeah.  You know, it's just, uh...  Yeah.  Too many possibilities that it was caught somewhere.  Yeah, you know, if one guy's got it out for somebody, you know, somebody opens their mouth.  And cops are their own worst enemies also, because they talk like whores. 
[02:03:00]  You know, because when you got, you know, like, you got eight hours to kill in the day, you're  just sitting around drinking coffee.  Jabber jawing.  Yeah.  They yap too much?  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  So...  All right.  It's a thankless job.  I'm fucking kidding.  Ah, this is coming from a retired cop here.  Says, um, there's no professional courtesy.  Young cops, young bosses, everyone goes to jail, fuck the police. 
[02:03:30]  That's from a guy that...  Yeah, that's from somebody who used to be on the force.  Used to be on the job.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's tough.  It's not like the old days.  Yeah, and now, like, we were talking about GPS the other day.  Yeah.  Like, now they're putting GPS in the radio cars.  How are you supposed to take a black guy into the Puerto Rican neighborhood and drop him  off?  Well, not only that, like, on the midnight tour, like, uh, they'll probably get on your  case if you're, like, parked in one place for six hours just doing paperwork. 
[02:04:00]  Paperwork.  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah, but, you know, the paperwork has to get done at some point, right?  Yeah.  I'll tell you, you know what was a good night for me?  I worked midnights for seven years.  And you have to, like, put down your mileage on your log sheet.  Uh-huh.  You know, I would love to, like, put on my log sheet, like when I had single digits. 
[02:04:30]  Just like three miles?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a beautiful night.  Do they ever question it?  Well, I would always write one ticket.  It's like a vitamin.  You've got to give them one a day.  And then there's some guys, they don't write any tickets, and then they get, like, verbally counseled.  And then they go out, they write one ticket that's 100% improvement.  100% improvement.  That's fantastic.  From zero to one. 
[02:05:00]  Now you're doing great, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you ever nap on the job?  Yeah.  No, that's against the code of conduct.  Yes.  Right, no sleeping.  A lot of guys would check for cracks in their eyelids.  Can't do that when your eyes are open.  Is that what they call it?  Yeah.  I read that in a movie or a book or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you ever hear about cops that would take, like, did you ever hear about guys that would 
[02:05:30]  just pull somewhere and park and then fucking sleep?  Is that, like, a rumor that cops have done that?  Yeah, you see that in movies and books where they sleep and, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, I saw in this one movie that a cop was, like, sleeping in a park.  Yeah.  And, like, cops that sleep in a park, they always got to get up before the sunrise because,  like, the dog walkers and the joggers come, you know, so you got to get out of there so  they don't catch you.  They don't see you. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But I saw in this movie one time this cop was sleeping in the park.  Yeah.  And when he woke up, it was, like, frost or dew on the windshield, and somebody, like,  with their finger, like, drew a tombstone in R.I.P. on the frost.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, and the cop, like, woke up to that and was, like, frightened.  What movie was that?  I got to rent that.  Yeah.  It was one of those back in the day.  We like cop movies.  Which one?  Sounds like a good movie. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't one of those, like, bestsellers.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do you think any cops have ever been woken up?  Did guys sleep with the windows open or closed?  No, they're stupid.  I know one cop got his throat slashed.  Really?  Because he had the window, like, halfway down, and a guy come in and, like,  Did he kill him or did he?  No, they didn't kill him, but he's lucky.  Fuck.  Did he find out who it was?  No, the guy ran away, and, you know, they never caught him, and that was the end of that. 
[02:07:00]  You know, because now there's cameras everywhere.  Like, back then, you had to, like, do, like, intelligent police work.  You know.  Scope out a good spot.  Yeah.  You know, but, like, you had to investigate and get a good informant, do a good interrogation,  get the information out of them.  Sure.  Was there good informants out there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As long as you know the good investigative interrogation techniques. 
[02:07:30]  I can only imagine.  Now.  I can only.  They got all the forensic files and.  Yeah, yeah.  All that stuff.  All that stuff.  Gotta be careful.  That just teaches the shit-ums to be better.  The shit-ums?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The shit-ums.  What?  Did I ask?  The bad people.  Oh, okay.  The shit-ums.  Yeah.  You never heard that before?  Oh, not quite.  It's an old school one.  Yeah.  It is old school. 
[02:08:00]  Sounds like a toy made out of shit for kids.  Shit-ums.  All right.  That's great.  It's no fun no more.  Well, there's a few cops, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we say hi to Adam in D.C.?  Adam.  Hey, boys.  Guess what?  No way.  Not anymore.  Cops do not let other cops off for D.Y.  That just doesn't happen.  No, huh?  It's becoming politically incorrect to get a D.U.I.  as it is to get into a domestic dispute or something like that. 
[02:08:30]  Cameras are everywhere.  Everybody's videotaping you all the time.  You just assume that somebody's taking your picture.  There's no way that one cop lets another cop anymore off of a D.U.I.  You'd have to be in some, like, dark, secluded alley.  He'd have to be, like, borderline, and you never even called in to stop in order to do it.  Because once you call it in, they want the results.  You're being watched constantly.  All right.  There you go.  Punch it out, boys.  Okay.  Let's go to Dave in North Carolina.  Dave. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, this happened down here in North Carolina where they called it in, and they had a state  trooper who was drunk, so they called it in.  You can hear them on the transmissions on the radio.  They had it on the news where, you know, they're saying the guy's drunk, and then their commanding  officer tells you to just take it to a hotel.  And then two weeks later, it's on the news, and everyone's fired.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that shit comes back, bites in the ass.  It doesn't fly anymore.  And finally, Amy in Oregon.  Amy?  Good morning.  Good morning, Amy. 
[02:09:30]  Hello.  You're a police officer?  What's that?  Are you a police officer?  I am.  All right.  You got a mullet?  About 15 years.  No, I don't.  Oh.  I keep my nails done, my makeup on.  Try not to stereotype myself.  Oh, very good.  So, you can't do it anymore.  We have video cameras in our cars.  They back up 30 seconds from the stop, so it gets everything on video.  All right.  It does what?  I'm sorry, 30 seconds from the stop what?  What'd you say? 
[02:10:00]  When you turn on your overheads, the cameras in the vehicles automatically back up 30 seconds  prior to your stop, so it's catching all the driving.  Oh.  It just catches everything.  Oh, it's automatic when the lights go on.  It catches 30 seconds before you turn your lights on.  Yeah, because now it's a computer hard drive, so it's constantly going.  So, when you hit the overheads...  30-second buffer, right.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Wow.  You can't.  Everything is on a zip drive, so you can't erase any audio, any video. 
[02:10:30]  And as soon as a defense attorney gets a hold of something that you let another cop off,  then every time that you take a DUI to trial, you're going to lose.  Wow.  Fuck.  Okay.  Oh, a defense attorney can get your old tapes?  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  And once you do it once, they must assume that, you know, you've done it every time.  Wait, do you have to wear a microphone?  Yes.  Yep.  Oh, you do? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, and the microphones come on automatically.  They're synced with your camera, and as soon as the overheads go on, your microphone starts  recording.  Oh, this...  Okay, so you can't do it.  What...  The...  Where do you have to wear, like, a mic pack, like, when you're doing an acting scene?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's heavy.  Yeah.  No.  No, they're not quite that big.  Yeah, it's like the size of my Blackberry.  Yeah, where's it going?  Your belt loop?  Clipping your belt, throwing it in your pocket, just like, yeah.  Yeah, I know, but that's fucking annoying.  I know.  It is very annoying.  On occasion, you know, leave them in the car, but now they've made it into policy. 
[02:11:30]  They've got GPS on you, they've got video, they've got audio.  You can't do anything anymore.  The man's always watching here.  Is it good or bad for you as a cop that's like that?  It's horrible.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  It's horrible.  And it's not because we worry about that we're doing something wrong.  It's just that you lose that trust in your administration, that your administration  trusts that you're doing your job.  But does it help you at all in cases where a fucking guy say you beat the shit out of  him and that they didn't do anything and it's right on plane, like, does it also help 
[02:12:00]  justify force, too, where it's obvious a guy is, what's that?  It absolutely does.  When they call, when somebody calls in a complaint against you, your administration can go grab  the, you know, grab the tape.  We had, you know, a stabbing the other day and the whole thing, as far as what the officers  were doing, was all on video.  Wow.  I don't know.  It just seems a little too much.  Yeah.  This goes back to what we were talking about yesterday.  It's getting ridiculous around the workplace, no matter what you do. 
[02:12:30]  You should be able to kneecap somebody every so often just for the fuck of it.  Sometimes you've got to get rid of your frustration.  So you guys have a computer system that will actually just kick on your microphone and stuff  when your lights go on, and yet we can't figure out here how to not get me fucking booted  off with the iPad with your slippery stylus that dries out your fingertips.  You guys need to bring the police technicians in then.  All right, Amy. 
[02:13:00]  Thanks, Amy.  All right, let's go to Joe in Massachusetts.  Good sleeping on duty story.  Joe?  Morning, boys.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah, I've got a good sleeping story.  Can't confirm or deny whether it's true or not, but a buddy of mine told me a story when  he was working.  He knew a guy who was sleeping and got a bloody nose while he was sleeping, and the blood ran  down his face, down on his uniform and everything, woke up in the morning to the radios going  nuts, people looking for a shot cop because somebody walking by his cruiser saw him sleeping 
[02:13:30]  and the blood running down his face and thought somebody had shot and killed him.  So he fired the cruiser up and screwed the hell out of there.  And it was just a bloody nose.  Just a bloody nose, but he thought he got, somebody walking by thought he got shot in  the face and called it in.  Jesus.  He was looking for a shot cop.  How do you sleep through all that noise?  I can't sleep through all that noise.  I'd wake up.  Kenny?  No, it becomes like second nature. 
[02:14:00]  You've got to listen to the police radio and carry on a conversation at the same time.  And also get a few Z's in.  And check for cracks in your eyelids.  Yeah, back in the good old days when cops used to keep their cocaine rolled up in their  gun barrels.  You know, before piss tests.  Well, if you work in a sleepy town, you don't have to worry about the radio too much,  you know?  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Eric in Staten Island.  Eric.  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to say the whole thing went to professional courtesy. 
[02:14:30]  That guy was a corrections officer, and that's not the same as the cop.  I wouldn't put my job in line to help them out.  Yeah, no, I understand that, but there always seemed to be some kind of a law enforcement  courtesy thing, but, no.  Yeah, but when you're talking like that, I mean, we always say that corrections officers  are herps with badges.  But, I mean, if he's getting brought up to the station now, chances are he got into an  accident, and you can't shit-can those.  How about if I'm friends with a cop and I drunk drive through a mall? 
[02:15:00]  Well, that's what a PBA card is for, Jim.  Yeah, you just pull out your PBA card.  You just pull out that PBA card.  Is this the way to do it?  Like, when I get pulled over and the cop comes over, I'll just crack my window an eighth  of an inch, even if it's raining, and I'll just put the PBA card through it.  I'll make him reach in with his fingertips and grab it.  You can use an SBA or an LBA card for that one.  I don't know if it's PBA.  What's LBA or SBA?  Sergeant, Lieutenant.  SBA is Sergeant, Lieutenant, yep.  I'd love a Lieutenant card.  Do I know any Lieutenants? 
[02:15:30]  You bet I do.  Could I have a card?  You don't have a card?  No, why would I?  He hates me.  I don't have a Lieutenant card.  All right, punch it out, boys.  All right, brother.  That helps, Lieutenant card?  Some situations.  I would just put it right through.  I might have thrown away a couple of times.  I would put it right up and make him reach in with his fingertips, and then as he pulled  the PBA card, I would just step on the gas and leave.  I would let that fucking guy know.  Who's boss?  Yeah, here's the card.  Now fucking send it back to me. 
[02:16:00]  And just let him sort it out?  No, I would do this.  I would make him grab it, and I would just go like this.  I'd like to get it back quickly, and then I would just gun it.  Damien, Eerie PA.  What's up, Damien?  Hey, what's up, boys?  They had a girl get robbed and stripped naked and dumped on a highway in Cleveland, Ohio.  And people called it in.  These two cops came out, drove by, did 50 on the highway, looked at it, said it was a  deer, and disappeared.  They called the city out. 
[02:16:30]  The city came out thinking it was a dead deer.  It was a girl.  So they called the cops again and said, no, it's an actual body.  And it turned out it was a body.  They checked these cops' GPS, and it turned out they were in a cemetery asleep.  They came out, drove past the body, went back to the cemetery, and went back to sleep.  And they got all this shit off their GPS.  They already got them in the cars here in Cleveland, Ohio.  So they thought it was a, they just did a half-asleep look if it was a deer?  They just drove by.  They didn't even slow down.  They checked the GPS, and they found out they were doing 50 when they rolled past the body. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, but if you know you have the GPS and all that now, you're going to, you know, they're dumb.  Whose side are you on?  I'm just reporting the story.  I can't even, I love you guys.  I'm just reporting the story.  But if you know you got all that technology now, now you know you got to fucking wake the fuck up  and make sure it's not a deer.  Yep.  They were just fucking stupid.  They found out, but they watched it.  Because, you know, yeah, this happened, like, back in, I think, April.  Okay.  And you haven't heard nothing else about it.  Because people were talking about these cops need to be fired and shit like that.  You haven't heard anything else about it.  But, yeah, they've had a GPS in there for a while. 
[02:17:30]  And once they found that out, man, oh, everything went crazy in the fucking news.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to John in Denver.  John.  Hey, boy.  Hey.  Grew up in a small town in the 70s.  My mother was a dispatcher by herself in the police department.  Three cops on duty in the town.  She told me frequent stories about this one Irish cop named O'Halloran.  She would come in the middle of the night with some African-American gentleman. 
[02:18:00]  And she knew he was going to beat on him in the back room.  But as he would walk through, he would yell at her through the window, hey, type something.  So that way she couldn't hear him tuning this guy up a couple of rooms over.  Type something.  Type something.  That's good.  Any little noise distraction.  Wow.  And this guy's just really mad at Ant for some reason.  What did I do?  I don't know.  I think you've behaved today, right?  What did I do, pyrotrucker?  Yeah, what could...  Go ahead. 
[02:18:30]  I've calmed down, but I'm extremely angry at this conversation.  All right, why?  Yesterday, a truck driver called in and said they put a GPS on his truck,  and his boss is watching him 24-7 for stupid shit.  And Anthony defends the boss's right to do that as it's his company.  We have this conversation today where the last, the female officer that calls in says, 
[02:19:00]  we're being videotaped, and Anthony makes the comment, you know, it's just gone too far.  Yeah.  The reason it's gone too far is because of this shit, the last couple of calls you just heard,  and all the fucking bullshit that Kenny just said.  When somebody is not watching, the cops are just as fucking crooked as the crooks.  Not just as crooked, sir.  Here's my point.  The truckers, I think, should have GPS on them because the bosses should know where they are, 
[02:19:30]  if they're doing their job or not.  The cops shouldn't because when they're not being watched,  they beat the fuck out of people that are normally bad people.  That's right.  Yeah, so, and I kind of like that idea.  What's the matter, trucker?  You don't like the Smokies?  As a matter of fact, Kenny, when I was in a traffic accident,  I didn't get the pass like you give your fucking buddies.  I got held up by two guys, handcuffed, and got roundhoused in the float by another cop. 
[02:20:00]  Why?  You must have been an asshole.  That was my pass.  Wait, what happened, sir?  You didn't just get pulled over and beat up for no reason.  I was drunk and in an accident.  Okay.  And after everybody left the scene, the cops thought it was their position to try to fucking kill me.  You don't roundhouse somebody in the throat without trying to crush a windpipe. 
[02:20:30]  You remembered it.  You remembered it.  Maybe we won't fucking drink and drive now.  Sir, that's a lovely memory.  So why should a cop get the same fucking pass?  Lovely memory.  He should have been roundhouse in the float also.  Thanks for sharing.  Right, Kenny?  Yeah, look, you got this great story to tell now.  Just keep it between the double nickels.  The double nickels.  Now you're crooked fucking buddy cops. 
[02:21:00]  Now you've got...  Don't get the white line fever, sir.  Now you've got people watching you, you fucking prick.  Come on.  Put the pedal to the metal.  All right.  Eastbound and down.  Actually, I'm going south, but I love you guys.  All right.  All right.  Have a nice day anyway.  I will.  Godspeed.  Oh, he liked that story. 
[02:21:30]  Keep it between the double nickels.  You have a lovely memory now.  Keep it between the double nickels.  All right.  Yeah, that was great.  There's a million fucking stories coming in now.  I think as far as the GPS goes, though, you got to give cops a little latitude.  Come on.  You got to give them a little, not a little attitude, a little latitude.  Just to, you know, get the job done right.  Look, I'm getting a lot of communiques now from police officers. 
[02:22:00]  The guy deserved it.  Look on the bright side.  At least he didn't get nightsticked or tasered.  Yeah.  See?  See?  There's always a silver lining to the story.  Look on the bright side.  Silver lining.  You didn't have a taser, did you?  No, no, no.  No, they had better stuff.  Yeah, old school.  Sap.  Do you wish you had had one?  No.  I didn't even like to use pepper spray. 
[02:22:30]  Why?  The first time I ever used it, I worked this parade detail, and it was, at the end of the  day, I was taking a slow ride back to the precinct, fell out my overtime slip, and I saw there  was this big fight in the street, and as I got closer, I saw they were all firemen fighting.  Oh.  You know?  So, like, you pull up, you hit the siren, and then they go, oh, shit, you know, we better  break it up.  You're going to get in trouble. 
[02:23:00]  The cops are here, you know.  They didn't stop fighting.  So I get out of the car, and I remembered I got this new toy, pepper spray.  And so I sprayed it over the top of the crowd, and then, like, you know, they all started,  like, dispersing.  Oh, it worked?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then the big black doorman, the bouncer, who sold pot at the door, got mad and was yelling  at me because he was helping, and I sprayed him, so I sprayed him again.  You sprayed who again?  The doorman.  Because he was complaining. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So then I go in, and when I get into the precinct, I had to take a piss.  So I took a piss, and then, you know, two minutes later, I'm sitting down at my desk,  filling out my overtime form, and my dick and balls is burning because there must have been  some overspray on my hand from the pepper spray.  So I never use that shit anymore.  And plus, there was other incidents, like, when cops use it, and they, you know, you're  only supposed to spray, like, a half a second burst, they fucking cologne the guy, you know, 
[02:24:00]  and then, you know, and all the cops get contaminated by it, too, yeah.  Especially in a car.  Yeah, yeah, so, you know, so I never liked that shit, you know.  I'm always amazed, and I see that, like, they pepper spray the shit out of someone in a car,  and then they dive in and grab them out the window.  It's like, I would think they would get a bunch of pepper spray in their eyes.  There's nothing like busting a knuckle on a jawbone.  That's the good old way of doing it. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That'll stun you.  Oh, yeah.  You don't need a taser or anything.  It's like you've been tased, right?  You know, in the movies, when they give them the uppercut to the gut?  The end of the nightstick into the friggin' gut?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at, he smiles like you're talking about old Christmas stories.  Yeah.  And he loves this.  Oh, and then the invention of the mag light, that was a beautiful thing.  Oh, wow.  Just a bunch of D batteries and a nice aluminum tube. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, that was a beautiful thing.  Would you hold it close to the lid end so you could just swing it?  Oh, would that illuminate the night?  Jesus, Kenny.  That's a heavy one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  D cell batteries, but rechargeable.  Why does a flashlight have to be so heavy and so long?  I don't get it, Kenny.  Well, you know, back in the day, everything was big and bulky.  Now everything's, like, streamlined.  Yeah, they got the little tiny lights now.  Yeah, what are you going to do with that? 
[02:25:30]  Look up your asshole?  Look at how big these fucking things are used to be.  That one's actually got a fucking attachment you put on it,  so it becomes like a club, like a nightstick.  Yeah, like the PR-24 baton.  Yeah, look at that.  What are those other things that they would, I don't know if cops would carry them,  but they look like little leather things with balls on them.  What are they called?  Ball gags?  A blackjack.  My underwear.  Yeah.  Oh, blackjack.  Yeah, I used to have the slapper, the flat one. 
[02:26:00]  Slapper, that's what it's called.  I had one, too.  I don't know if I still have one.  Those are illegal, huh?  Yes, they're illegal.  I don't know if I ever had one.  Why would it be illegal?  Yeah, you had one.  Yeah, but I don't know if I still have it.  I think I did.  You're not allowed to have anything anymore to protect yourself.  I don't know.  I guess some people feel you could do, like, permanent damage or injury if you get hit.  If you really smack somebody in the jaw, would that knock most people out?  I fucking broke one once.  I had to take it to the fucking shoemaker to get it back up. 
[02:26:30]  He took his sap to the cobbler.  I fucking hit this guy so many times.  He was so, like, fucking coked up.  Like, he just got tired of hitting and gave up.  But he did knock him out?  No.  I must have hit him fucking eight times in the head.  And it cracked?  Yeah, and I fucking, I bent the fucking leather piece, the lead piece at the end, and the fucking thing, the seam split.  I had to take it to the shoemaker to get it stitched up.  And that just annoyed you, right? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, because it's sentimental.  I got it my whole career.  Holy shit, Kenny.  That's fantastic.  How scary is that, though, when you're fucking hitting a guy eight times with that and nothing's happening?  Yeah, he just got tired of getting hit and gave up.  He said, you know, let me cut it.  It's like, all right.  You couldn't take him out, though, huh?  Wow.  Wow.  That's something.  Man, what about those nightsticks that you flick out? 
[02:27:30]  The batons?  Oh, yeah, the expandables?  Yeah, what do you think of those?  Yeah, I never went for that fancy technology.  A telescopic baton?  You never went for that, huh?  No, no, no.  Those look like they get hurt.  I never even carried a nightstick.  I had my slapper and a flashlight.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  No, you don't need no nightstick.  Yeah, no, no honoring weapons.  Your slapper hurts, all right?  Oh, yeah, she hurts.  Friggin' hurts.  I want to carry one. 
[02:28:00]  Because small goes in your pocket.  It'd be nice to be able to carry something to protect yourself.  Yeah.  You're not allowed.  You're not allowed.  Would I go to jail for having that?  Yes.  Like, I would get arrested?  Yes.  But would I go to jail for how long?  No, probably first offense.  I don't, you know, like, a gun is definitely mandatory jail.  I'm a gun.  I just...  But, you know, hopefully you should get, could get probation, community service, hopefully.  I don't know.  I'm a slapper?  It's crazy.  You're not allowed to carry anything.  Any kind of knives or, yeah, a slapper, brass knuckles.  You can't carry anything to protect yourself. 
[02:28:30]  Back in the day, everybody had a knife in their pocket.  I used to fill shoe boxes in my locker full of knives.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone carried a knife.  Yeah, everybody had one.  And you just took it from them.  Yeah.  Now you gotta...  Yeah, they didn't care.  Now you gotta arrest them.  Yeah.  You know, and back in the day...  Oh, this is...  I heard.  This is all stuff I heard.  From a movie?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, secondhand.  Okay.  Secondhand movie.  You know, back in the day, like, you know, when you're on the street, a guy would rather 
[02:29:00]  take a beating than get locked up.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Maybe just, that'll be the end of it, you know.  So you get a little street justice...  Yeah.  ...and cut out the middlemen, like the judicial system.  Yeah, no paperwork.  No, no.  No paperwork, no court, no nothing.  Yeah, street justice.  Yeah.  A beating for what, though?  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  Whatever the case may be, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  I love the old school stories.  They just don't...  They don't make cops like Kenny anymore. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  A civilian can carry pepper spray if it's only like 5% and less than three-quarter of an ounce  canister.  I don't even think you can in the city, though, can you?  I don't know about San Jose.  Yeah, I don't think New York City...  New York City, they don't allow anything.  It's fucking so annoying when you're going to be a victim in a subway attack.  Oh, but believe me, bad guys, they can do whatever the fuck they want, and they will.  But you can't defend yourself.  You're not allowed.  It's fucking ridiculous. 
[02:30:00]  It really is ridiculous.  It's amazing.  All right, Officer Kenny, thank you.  Wow, that...  Old school Officer Kenny.  Old school.  I think we have Amy Schumer here.  Amy, okay.  So why don't we take a break, and we'll get a very funny comic in studio.  Yes.  Amy Schumer, good friend of the show.  All right?  Yes.  And I got to communicate from my wife, and oof.  What?  Well, I mean, I could save it for after the break, because I can't trump what Kenny just said.  All right.  All right, she writes this. 
[02:30:30]  Either you fell asleep with an M&M in your pocket, or you shit the bed.  Come on.  You want to see it for yourself?  You didn't have M&M.  Is it a picture?  Well, I have a lot of M&Ms at home, so I'm praying for M&Ms.  Yeah, you were talking about it.  Because I went to the M&M fucking store two days ago with my nephew.  Either you fell asleep with an M&M in your pocket, or you shit the bed.  I'm rooting for both.  Oh, God.  I hope you shit your bed. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, of course.  Oh, do I hope you shit your bed.  I hope you popped a nugget out.  Yeah.  You were scared in your sleep.  Popped one little nugget, and then just kind of rubbed it all over the place.  One little nougat.  As I'm rolling around at night.  As Bob Kelly calls it, a nougat.  A nougat.  Well, hopefully she'll find out if it's shit or M&Ms, and I'll have an answer after the break.  Stupid Bob, who I was talking to yesterday, and he was trying to say renege, but he kept saying renege.  Dude, he reneged, and I'm like, as much as I'm enjoying this. 
[02:31:30]  I know, exactly.  You have to say it right.  Renegged.  Oh, stop.  Renegged is incorrect.  Stop it.  What's that called?  A re-election?  All right, the research has begun.  How is she going to research this?  She's going to smell the fucking sheets?  Yeah, she's got it.  That's probably a good way to figure it out.  I've never had an M&M taste election.  Hey, man, send a picture.  Send a picture.  Hopefully she'll send a picture, and then we can do our own research here at the Opie and Anthony Institute. 
[02:32:00]  At the Institute.  Yeah, hopefully she'll send me a picture in a few minutes here.  All right, we'll get Amy Schumer in here next.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Serious.  Serious.  Exit.  Let's do this.  Opie and Anthony, Amy Schumer in studio.  Hello, hello.  And right off the bat, she walks in seconds ago and says, I'm fucked up. 
[02:32:30]  You're dealing with a really bad sunburn.  Yes, I am.  Which happens in the summertime.  I didn't know that sunblock could expire.  I know condoms can expire, milk, the important shit.  Yeah.  But I had no idea.  My mucinex expired.  But it seemed to, you know, still get the phlegm off.  I just thought that was just a ploy.  To get you to buy more of the stuff after a certain amount of time.  No, I look like an albino child that saw sun for the first time.  I like when you get a sunburn and then you don't remember for that second. 
[02:33:00]  You have a sunburn and you scratch yourself.  And then it's that five second delay.  And then the pain.  Right.  So you're a bit stiff?  I'm a little stiff.  You can't really move around?  Not really.  Can you pat her on the back, Jimmy?  Oh, that's okay.  Good to see you, Amy.  Good to see you.  Oh, man.  Next time, you're up in Utica.  Oh, God.  Is that where he was from?  Yeah.  Utica.  Would you take a pat to the back?  I missed the opening.  She's got a really bad sunburn. 
[02:33:30]  She's sunburned.  Where were you?  Long Beach.  Okay.  Yeah.  Long Beach is where?  Long Island?  Long Island, yeah.  That's a nice little area.  So everything is down on the south shore.  Not California.  No.  She used suntan lotion that was expired.  Does it expire, though?  Yes.  And I guess when it expires, it doesn't really work.  I'm going to spread the word now.  That's going to be my cause.  Did you lay out?  No, I was surfing.  Really?  You surf?  Yeah.  I have a bad surfing injury on my leg.  What's your injury?  I skagged myself. 
[02:34:00]  My whole fin went into my board when I was 17.  I had to pull it out.  What's that mean?  Well, you know, just what I said.  You skagged yourself?  Yeah, it's called skagging yourself.  The fin of my board went all the way into my leg.  And I just thought I was going to have a bad bruise.  And then I pulled it out, and the water all around me got red.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  It was pretty disgusting.  And then I was like, oh, sharks.  Let me get out of here.  You know Laszlo?  He surfs down there.  Oh, no.  Yeah, he does.  Well, maybe I do.  Are you good at surfing? 
[02:34:30]  Apparently not.  She's poking her leg.  That's fucking cool.  I'm poking myself up.  Yeah.  How bad does the leg look now?  It looked really bad at first.  Now the scar is small.  It looks like a vagina.  Oh, cool.  It's just, I want to give people options.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're bored with that whole, look what mama got.  It must look really good when it first happened.  Oh, it was so, put a tampon in there.  It was so disgusting.  And actually, when it was like healing, I did, I used a maxi pad to, like, when I went 
[02:35:00]  back to play volleyball.  Big band-aid.  Yeah, it worked.  It worked.  But I didn't know.  It was 41 stitches in three layers.  And I didn't know.  They didn't tell me what the other layers are.  I thought it was all just the same kind of stitch.  And after a volleyball tournament, I took the bandage off and I saw a worm kind of creep  out of my leg and move around.  Get the fuck out of here.  And I was like, oh my God, it happened in the ocean.  Like, maybe there's some sort of a, so we rushed to the hospital and the doctor looks  and he's like, oh my God.  And then he's like, oh, it's a suture. 
[02:35:30]  I didn't know what that was.  I was like, oh, some sort of a fucking African.  A suture worm?  But it was, no, it was just an internal stitch that grows out.  But I was like, just amputate.  Just take it.  Take it.  Take my leg off now.  It was horrible.  Oh, creepy.  You're not creeped out, though, by the ocean, I guess, because there's monsters in there.  Sometimes I freak out.  Oh, you do?  Monsters.  Yeah.  Surfers usually don't freak out.  You, like, pull your feet and arms up and just, like, lose it for a minute?  Yeah.  Sometimes when I'm surfing, I'll freak out.  No, I'm not scared of monsters in the water.  You know, and you know it's going to be all white people in there. 
[02:36:00]  It's like different things you embrace when you're up there.  I see no purse snatchings in the water.  It would never go swimming over his head.  No?  Really?  What are you afraid of?  No, it's going to go swimming over my head.  But there's such big monsters in the ocean.  They're shitless of you.  And you can't see them.  They're just down there.  What monsters?  What are you talking about?  Big fish.  All you have to do is they're big, like, fish things.  All you have to do is...  Not even sharks.  I'm talking, like, just fish that are, like, two feet long are big, scary things.  They don't come near you. 
[02:36:30]  Like, I've never heard of anybody getting...  All you have to do, Anthony, is go scuba diving one time and you realize everything is  scared shit.  I've gone scuba diving.  You have?  No, no, snorkeling.  Snorkeling.  That's it.  Oh, wow.  I've gone snorkeling.  All right, I'm a faggot.  You know what?  My pool is nice.  Yeah, you're really exposing yourself.  It's very warm and there's nothing in there.  Occasionally a monster's in there during some parties.  They don't want to check you out.  They wanted to swim away.  Yeah, they're not interested.  Nope.  We're boring.  Yeah, yeah, tell that...  I watched Shark Week.  I saw what happened.  Those are all accidents.  They bump into you and they bite and realize they don't watch you and they go. 
[02:37:00]  I listen to these fucking hypocritical, two-faced, two-sided shows.  One show you watch during Shark Week is like, and the shark really doesn't find humans tasty.  They poke and taste and release when they realize it's like...  And then another show is like, the deadliest creature in the ocean is the shark.  There's thousands of them right here in our area that could eat me at any time.  They're very rare.  You never even see a shark. 
[02:37:30]  They're almost on the verge of extinction.  Here I am amongst thousands of man-eating sharks.  Every other show was one where we're the bad guy killing the sharks off.  And then the next show was how dangerous...  I'm in a cage and he bashed through the cage and holy shit, it's Shark Week.  That's all ratings crap.  I get very scared of the ocean.  They don't want us.  Very scared of the ocean.  Manly.  I like...  You know what I like?  I like going to the Bahamas and having a coconut drink on the beach.  Right.  And then I'll go walking up my ankle deep. 
[02:38:00]  Go wading.  That's nice.  Ankle deep.  That's nice.  It's nice.  The water's warm.  I can watch things.  It's like surfing.  Yeah.  That's just like...  It's like the same thing.  I'll jet ski.  I like to jet ski.  Aren't you freaked out when you jet ski?  If I fall off, I go like, and I swim as fast as I can to get back to the jet ski, and I  anticipate something biting me, and it freaks me out.  Let me give you a scenario.  A North Shore beach on Long Island.  Yeah.  It's night.  Would you swim out to a buoy over your head?  Get the fuck out of here. 
[02:38:30]  Why not?  It started to sound sexy.  I thought you were setting up a reality.  Night.  Like I'm Chrissy.  A picture of tiger lilies.  We used to swim at night, and we'd be scared shitless because it's night.  What's the fucking difference?  Why would you do that when you could just be drinking?  During the day, you will swim out through these buoys like it's nothing.  At night, you know, there's always dares going on.  It's like, what's the difference?  It is amazing you're nervous about swimming, but you will fucking drink a 12-pack and then  get behind the wheel of an Escalade.  Do a fucking 110 on the LA.  Allegedly. 
[02:39:00]  Boppy, I want to ask you a question.  What'd you swim out to?  A buoy?  Bubble buoy, bubble buoy, bubble buoy, get it?  Yuck.  19, what?  Yuck.  What else is going on, Amy?  You got the sunburn?  It's safer that way.  Danny, pat Amy Schumer on the back.  No, that's okay.  What?  Hey, how are you?  Nice to see you.  You look thinner.  Not that you needed to lose weight, but you'll be able to lose weight.  Oh, nice addition to that.  What a half of a compliment.  That really is a backhand.  You look like you've less cellulated your face.  She's my friend.  No.  You're not supposed to ever say that. 
[02:39:30]  But Amy looked like she lost weight.  It's a good thing.  Thank you.  You do look like you lost a lot of weight.  I've been dabbling with an eating disorder.  Oh, at a girl.  Yeah, thanks.  Very cool.  You got my anonymous emails.  I did.  I did.  Which one?  The one where you just don't eat or the pukey one?  No, I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  Off the record, both.  Both.  Yeah, no, I've just been purging.  I like the not eating one for girls more than the pukey one.  I get so hungry so fast.  In college, I was like, I've got to do this.  I've got to develop an eating disorder.  Binge and purge. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I was like, I'm starving.  This is horrible.  I ate a sub to make up for lost time.  But no, I've been, I don't know.  I guess it's summer.  I noticed because of your sweatshirt.  She has a fused sweatshirt on.  Yeah.  Because she got it.  No, it's good, actually.  And that's why I noticed it looks like it makes you look very thin.  Unless she fucking, she lost weight.  And then I realized she got a TV show.  I'm going to be wearing this sweatshirt all the time now.  People are like, what's going on with your sweatshirt?  It might be the sunburn.  It might be the sunburn with the fused.  The sunburn might make you look a little thinner.  I'm going to do this.  This is what I'm going to rock from now on.  A terrible sunburn.  And the braid pigtails help, too. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah?  It's all thinning me out?  It gives it that junior high look.  And it's all working.  My plans are working.  Yeah, the pigtails work very well on you.  Oh, good.  Amy's fucking hot.  Get some fake braces and put those in.  Amy's hot.  She's not what says really dirty things on stage.  She's very dirty.  She's a dirty bird.  I am.  And you know what?  Here's what's dangerous.  I, for the past month and a half, I'm newly single.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, I haven't been single.  I've gone from boyfriend to boyfriend for a while. 
[02:41:00]  So it's like the highway to the danger zone right now.  I'm just like, oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Get some banging in.  It's brutal.  You've got to take some time for yourself.  That's what I'm calling it.  Time for myself.  No, it's that relationship to relationship thing is just a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  I was so scared.  I was like scared to not be in a relationship.  Yeah.  Partially because I don't want to jump back on the whore train.  But, you know, all aboard. 
[02:41:30]  No.  Choo-choo.  But then, yeah, you're like scared.  I was scared of being.  Choo-choo.  I was scared.  I was like, oh, God, what if I get really lonely?  And then you're like, oh, this isn't that bad.  This is good.  No, it's kind of like nice.  Yeah.  You know, you're just even doing nothing.  Would you be jealous if you saw him with a girl or no?  Yeah.  Oh, you're right?  I think so.  Yeah.  Part of me feels like totally jealous and part of me doesn't give a shit.  You know?  Yeah.  Like I'm always like, I don't know.  There have been times where I'm like, I would like to see him with another chick.  And sometimes where that thought would make me sick. 
[02:42:00]  People want us to tweet a picture of Amy, but she's got sunburned.  Oh, man.  You guys are just telling me how great I look.  And now you're like, nobody wants to see this.  No, people would like to see me.  Nobody knows what Amy looks like.  Nobody needs to see this.  Yeah, but they need new spank material.  Oh, good.  It doesn't matter how old the pictures are.  You always need new pictures.  Can we rub vinegar on your sunburn?  Oh, no.  That's okay.  Oh, no.  Really?  You don't want a picture, baby?  Oh, God, no.  No.  No.  I'll let you approve it before I Twitter it.  I feel like the ghost of Christmas albino. 
[02:42:30]  You can't approve.  Oh, nice video.  Oh, that's even worse.  Don't you love when you do that by accident and take a video or something like that?  Do you want to take a glamour shot?  Oh, I really shouldn't.  All right.  You want to take a glamour shot?  Oh, you want to do that?  All right.  Hold on.  I hate pictures.  One, two.  Glamour shot.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, there it is.  No, you can rule.  I usually hate pictures.  All right, I'll tweet.  Yeah, you should.  Because look at the awful front lines.  It's all blurry.  Oh, no.  I don't know how to spell Schumer, though.  Oh, God.  I look like a sunburned nightmare.  Amy's cute, man.  Yeah, you're really cute.  That's a good picture.  Hey, Amy, what's your... 
[02:43:00]  I follow you, but I don't know offhand.  Oh, at Amy Schumer.  A-M-Y-S-C-H-U-M-E-R.  Wait.  Uh, what?  A-M-Y-S-C-H-U-M-E-R.  A-M-Y-what?  S-C-H.  Somebody get him a scantron.  U-M-E-R.  U-M-E-R.  Yeah.  What?  Okay.  I bet you get pretty sunburned.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm bad.  Yeah.  I'm bad.  Have they all been white?  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I want to keep my stock right where it is. 
[02:43:30]  No Dominicans?  No.  I've never dabbled in that stuff.  But...  The slow clap.  The slow clap.  But honestly, yeah.  But it's interesting, because fantasizing and looking at porn, it's all over the map.  It's a virtual U-M.  Yeah.  Everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, but when it comes down to it, I've been pretty...  At the cellar, Keith calls me pure uncut cocoa.  So wait, you can watch black on blonde porn and not be uncomfortable, but in real life, 
[02:44:00]  it's like, eh.  Yeah.  In real life, I've just never...  I've never...  If it's come down to it, I've been like, oh, I think I gotta go home.  I don't know.  I can't.  I can't.  But yeah, I like that porn.  What do you like about it?  The taboos part of it?  Because I can watch it once in a while.  I go back and forth.  Oh, God.  I either really, really hate it or it's tolerable.  It's Danny.  Amy, you like that?  That's a fucking...  Oh, that's great.  She looks excited.  That is a giant...  She's like, is this thing on?  It's a fake penis.  You like that?  Come on. 
[02:44:30]  You'll get a real one?  I'll get a real one.  Thank you.  What a sweetheart.  The last time I looked over, it was pictures of me.  Do you like that?  She's so surprised.  Yeah, that would scare the shit out of me.  There's a giant black penis in the foreground.  That's forced perspective.  Yeah, it really is.  I like that he's wearing a Livestrong bracelet.  Is that the message that Lance is trying to get out there?  Wraps it around his shaft and balls when he wants to last longer.  What gets you up those hills, Lance?  A huge black dick. 
[02:45:00]  Find a good one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Oh, boy.  What makes a good one?  A good one.  Well, I'm glad you asked.  Tears and a father hanging himself.  Oh, man.  That kind of porno, not my cup of tea either.  No?  You can't...  I can't get past my own racism.  But don't you just like to watch porn and be mad sometimes?  No, no.  Not that kind of porn.  Any other porn is fine by me.  Really?  The interracial stuff gets me like, oh, God.  Because I just start thinking about, oh, the poor family. 
[02:45:30]  I like the dirtiness of it.  I like the fact that a girl likes it.  Really?  It doesn't turn me on to watch it.  It's about watching Cuba Goody Jr. be fucking the ass.  It's two gangster guys going at it.  Gay black porn.  Favorite part of Jerry Maguire.  Oh, wow.  That is really bad.  You guys don't like homo thugs?  Homo thugs?  Is that the name?  Danny's like, yeah.  One blood, one crip, two cocks. 
[02:46:00]  You want a sunburn remedy?  Beth in Indiana.  Sunburn remedy for Amy Schumer.  Okay.  Hi, Amy.  Hey, Beth.  I am a ginger.  You're a what?  Ginger.  She has red hair.  Oh, okay.  Freckles.  I'm like, is that some special...  She's hated.  Okay.  Good talk, Beth.  Good talk, Beth.  Beth, what do you say?  No, let's just cut our losses.  I don't know what she was going to say.  Amy, where are you playing, by the way?  Texas, huh?  Yeah, this weekend, just Friday, I'm at Nagadocious, Texas. 
[02:46:30]  Now we're outside Houston.  So you're almost in Houston.  That's good.  Yeah.  The career is rocking.  Yeah, like, it's going in the right direction.  I hope next year to be an hour from Fort Worth.  And then eventually I'll get to Dallas.  All right.  Yeah, and then...  Hotel Fredonia.  Hotel Fredonia.  What is the gig?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's one night.  One night only.  But you also just shot an episode for Curb.  Yeah.  Was that cool?  Yeah, it was really cool.  Who do you play?  I don't know.  Am I allowed to say that? 
[02:47:00]  I think it's pretty...  We don't know what you're saying.  Bobby Kelly.  What did Bobby tell you?  And he said, just shut up.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah.  Then I'll follow his lead.  Oh, Bobby Kelly shot for Curb?  Yeah.  We're in the same episode.  Oh, I didn't know.  Okay.  Well, that's cool.  Yeah.  He said, I can't say anything.  They tell you to shut up.  They tell you to shut up and sign something.  Right.  We shot the same day, but not at the same time.  Okay.  How's Larry?  Awesome.  Is he cool?  Yeah.  I really liked him.  Yeah, because I think Bobby said something stupid to him.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I saw him.  He gets...  He could get mad. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we hit it off, so...  Cool, Larry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I got to be on the set for a couple days, and just, it was hilarious.  He's really funny.  That's because you're hot.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'll take it.  I probably only needed you for a couple hours.  Right.  You know what?  They're like, throw her another line.  I want to look at her ass again.  I'm like, great.  That sounds great.  Where do you film that?  They're shooting five episodes in New York, so it's here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Wow, that is cool.  Damn.  I love that show.  Very good.  Very funny.  What's your new show? 
[02:48:00]  A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus.  Isn't he like a Blink guy?  Yeah, he's in Blink.  Has he been here?  He must have been, right?  I don't think he has.  Oh, no?  Yeah, he's awesome.  Cool.  It's going to be on the Fuse Network, and we start shooting in like a week.  Oh, you have?  Okay.  That's why the Fuse hoodie today.  Yeah.  Sorry, I didn't unpack yet.  I was just in LA doing stuff for it.  What's the show going to be about?  It's like everything music.  You know music?  No.  I did this Critics thing that they have in LA, and they were like, and Mark is on tour 
[02:48:30]  and couldn't be there, and they were just like firing questions at me, and I was like,  they were like, what are your favorite bands?  And I was like, just Britney.  And they were like, what?  No, I like, you know, I'm half up on music, I would say, but I'm not like...  How'd you get through the audition?  Did they ask you a lot?  What was the audition?  The audition, first, it was just kind of like...  Like, lay down here.  Yeah.  They inspected me.  It was a medical situation.  I was like, I've seen this.  For insurance.  I'm right.  I've seen this movie. 
[02:49:00]  The guy's like, here, you hold the camera for a minute.  And then I tested with Mark twice.  We went in, and we hit it off, like right away.  What did you test?  You talked about music?  I would be so bad at that.  I interviewed a couple musicians.  I think they wanted to see...  From like kind of younger bands, like a band Taking Back Sunday, Starship.  I don't know.  I really don't know the bands.  I'm like, I really like Neil Young.  They're like, great.  Yeah, it's a job.  But they know that I'm there to be the comic relief. 
[02:49:30]  I can't believe they used me, because I just said the worst shit ever in my audition.  They were like, what do you think about Wu-Tang?  And I was like, well, I went to a concert once.  It was like they opened up a cell block and gave everyone a mic.  And they were like, you're hired.  I was like, really?  That's all it took?  Yeah, no, but the fact that they picked me, I feel like they want it to be like a show  that people are going to be interested in.  It's not just going to be like TRL, complimenting everyone.  Well, Fuse TV, September 16th.  Yeah, thank you.  The premiere is very cool, man. 
[02:50:00]  I'm excited to have a job.  It's always these one nights at Hotel Fredonia's.  Well, speaking of that, a guy wants to offer you a ride.  Oh, that's nice.  And I think you should take him up on it.  Let's go to Todd in Detroit.  You're on with Amy Schumer.  Hey, boys.  Amy.  Hey, Todd.  Hey, I can give you an idea of Texas, but it's gas, grass, or ass.  I didn't hear that, but it sounds interesting.  Wait, what'd you say?  Gas, grass, or ass.  That's the only way I can get you to Texas.  What do you mean?  Gas, grass, or ass.  Nobody rides for Texas.  I heard you. 
[02:50:30]  No one rides for free.  Dumb bumper sticker.  I'll take grass.  Thank you.  Anthony, one question.  What?  Is it the blowjob before the jacuzzi?  What do you mean?  That's referencing Mel Gibson.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  I ain't falling for that one.  What do you mean?  He's gone.  Horrendous.  It's the immediate rapport you guys form with your fans.  Yeah.  I think draw people.  It's always been one of our big strengths here on our show is our rapport. 
[02:51:00]  He's referencing the Mel Gibson tape.  Yes.  Have you been following the Mel Gibson tape?  It's why I'm alive.  It's kind of old news now, but.  It's making me believe in God again.  Yeah.  Whose side are you on?  Mel's.  I love every moment of those tapes.  I want more.  I'm like, please, Lord, hear our prayer.  More.  Like every day when they were coming in, we were just like, oh my God, this is the best  thing.  It's the greatest.  I miss them.  It was like when I watched The Wire.  That's what I live for.  And now it's Mel. 
[02:51:30]  I'm hoping they're unreleased.  It's got to be.  I want more.  He would just come up with the greatest things.  That anger and the, just the, the wackiness of, of, what did he call her?  A glum.  A glum cunt.  A glum cunt.  How great is that?  Yeah.  So creative.  I'll put that.  Two four letter words.  One's dirty, one's not.  I think somebody needs to rewatch what women want.  Yeah.  And I heard The Wire in there.  We can't get enough of that damn show.  I can't.  I met Stringer Bell. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah?  In L.A.  Yeah.  Got his digits.  How'd you meet him?  Uh, he was at the TC, the critics thing I was at.  Yeah.  He has a show on the BBC coming out.  And I was thinking, we're talking and I'm thinking, will you be the first?  Uh, just thinking.  I mean, if you're going to, why not have it be Stringer Bell?  Is he handsome in person?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he like has a, an accent.  He's British.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  Staten Island?  What is that?  That's Hoboken.  He'd probably bring you.  Thank you.  That'll still ruin.  I'm going to continue doing Pilates until it's an option.  That'll ruin you. 
[02:52:30]  That'll ruin me.  Yeah.  Well, it'll ruin you.  You know what?  That's so funny.  If it came down to it, you know, it's like the end of the night.  It's night as you were describing before.  And it's about to happen.  I'll just picture you guys sitting here like, don't do it.  No, no, no.  Don't do it.  No.  Everybody just, white people forever bully your vagina.  We're giant cock blocking.  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet he's got something.  Takes all three of us.  It's like a battering ram on his floor.  Just trying to pour hot oil on it. 
[02:53:00]  Make him stop.  So, all right.  So, you're on a tear.  I don't know much about Amy's personal life.  I really don't.  No?  As much as we work together, I don't spend a lot of...  Why?  Why don't you guys get to know each other a little bit?  She's a good friend of mine.  We're usually making fun of Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, she's got her thing, and I got my girlfriend, and she's got her life, and whatever.  She likes to drink a little.  She likes to gamble a little.  I've never seen Amy in Predator mode.  I've never seen you in that mode.  Predator mode.  Really?  Yeah.  I've never seen you like that, because on the road, she was always... 
[02:53:30]  She liked shoplifting.  Oh, that's right.  I know all this stuff.  You're a thief.  Yeah.  At the end of the day, I would not put myself in the category as a good person.  Yeah.  I realized that about...  I don't remember what I realized about, like, what a horrible person she'd be to fall in love with.  I saw your face change.  You kind of took in, like, oh, you're a total cunt.  Yes.  I don't think she is, though.  Oh, she is.  But, I mean, not in a bad way.  No, no.  No, she's a good friend.  She's a kook.  Amy's a fucking very Manchurian candidate.  Really? 
[02:54:00]  Really?  I think of myself as the interpreter.  Fuck, let's get to know her more.  She did the shoplifting bit for us.  Not a bit.  I mean, it's real life, right?  It's just facts.  What else can you tell us about you that we haven't heard yet?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Were you raised rich or poor or middle class?  Oh, I was raised really rich until I was, like, 11, and then we were just so poor.  Didn't we talk about that last time?  Yeah.  Did we?  I don't remember.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think we did.  Something happened to the fortune.  Something happened to the Schumer fortune.  The Schumer fortune crumbled. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, was your dad made...  My dad...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He made Schumers.  He made small Schumers.  What do you mean?  Oh, my God.  Dad?  Invest in some horrible things?  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Well, it was just baby furniture from Italy.  Nobody else was doing it, and all the Richmond had...  Moms were like, we need a crib from Milan.  And then other people were like, well, we're going to do it, too.  And my dad just ate shit.  So, wait, a lot of people got involved with it?  Or began doing it?  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  And his furniture wasn't made in Italy?  It was made in Italy.  This is...  I'm telling you, this is going to be a black hole.  I don't care.  And now he has MS.  He's in a wheelchair.  And I have to, like, go...  Oh, my God.  I love Jim's serious face.  No.  Jim, you're serious...  Like, all expression...  He nods like he's, like, saying, yes, Father.  But really, inside, he's going, don't laugh.  Yeah, there's some evilness coming out of Jimmy right now.  Oh, I love it.  No, but come on.  I mean...  What's up with the MS?  He has it. 
[02:55:30]  He's in a wheelchair, and he...  I just took a video of him.  He shits himself, like, all the time now.  Oh!  So does Opie.  Jim!  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Jim, where are you going, Jim?  Jim.  It turns out to be Eminem.  Oh, it was Eminem?  Yes, that's the update.  If you want to think that, like, life doesn't always work out, watch yourself...  Watch your dad shit himself at LaGuardia.  Oh, no.  Why are you taking videos of him?  Well, it's not of him shitting himself.  It's he's shitting himself.  So what do you do when that happens?  He's just, like...  Oh, it's awful. 
[02:56:00]  It's, like, you know, I have to, like, clean him up.  I have to clean it up.  But you know what?  No, but it's so dark that it's funny.  I'm serious.  Like, it's not...  It's not even sad.  My family is so fucked up.  We just laugh.  How do you get that detail?  Do you clean him like a newborn?  Just lucked out.  Yeah, how do you clean him at LaGuardia?  Lift his legs over his head and wipe...  Actually, that time, that was the first time I ever saw, and he took care of that one himself.  But he was like, no, you could still walk people to the gate.  He's like, no, I want to walk you to the gate.  And, like, people are kind of just like, what is that smell? 
[02:56:30]  And I'm like, thanks, Dad.  You're the best.  Oh, no.  But the first time ever was my sister and I were...  We all went to an amusement park, and, like, we kept doing the same roller coaster.  And we came down in time.  My dad wasn't there.  And then finally, like, an hour later, he came back, and he wasn't wearing pants.  He was just wearing a long shirt.  And we were like, what's going on?  And then he, like, told me.  And I was like, oh.  And he had a convertible.  And I always made my sister sit in the back so that her face was in the wind.  And I was like, hey, you know what?  You know what, sweetheart?  You get shotgun tonight.  Today you get shotgun.  So she's in the front just looking sad, and I'm in the back, like, free falling. 
[02:57:00]  But wait.  Why don't you just wear something?  You can wear stuff that's where you don't have to, you know, diapers or fucking whatever it is.  MS is, you know.  That's evil.  MS is evil.  Yeah.  That's an evil one, man.  Yeah.  It's really brutal.  It sucks.  That's why I do a lot of charity work.  Just kidding.  But I'm going to start.  And you do that.  Guys, if you look at my license, you'll see that I'm an organ donor.  God's angels show up in weird places.  Yeah, but no, he, you know, sometimes it comes out in a liquid form, Jim. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Yeah, but won't that, they still sell stuff for that, right?  What?  Diapers.  Yeah.  This is, how hot is this conversation?  What?  This has gotten super, super sexy.  It really is hot.  Actually, these, like, hot Brazilians just moved in down from my mom, like these hot male models.  And I, like, wanted to talk to them.  So I went over and I was like, hey, do you guys have toilet paper?  And then I was like, wait, that is horrible.  And then they're like, how much?  And I'm like, a roll.  A whole roll.  I was like, wow.  Let me just kill this opportunity. 
[02:58:00]  Well, we want to get to know Amy.  And, well, you're on the road with Kenny and Jimmy.  So Kenny wrote down everything he's learned about you on the road.  Oh, great.  Great.  May I?  Please.  And don't stop me, okay?  I won't stop you.  There's five points I need to make.  Sure.  And then you can comment.  Okay.  Amy likes to have sex with the lights off.  Amy once banged a homeless guy.  Amy had an abortion.  Amy has STD.  And Amy is a Jew.  Okay.  How many of those are correct?  Two.  Two? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Two are correct.  Two are correct.  I'll say...  Oh, the Jew thing, obviously.  I'll say...  Jew in what?  I'll say she has sex in the dark.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Oh, that means this bed was left.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because I was just thinking, like, the other ones.  If you had...  Do you have sex with a homeless person?  No.  Okay.  Not on purpose.  He just takes things out of your act and tortures you with them.  That's what he does.  It's obviously an abortion.  No.  No abortion.  I think there must be something wrong with me that I've never been trying to do. 
[02:59:00]  You had an STD?  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, I have HPV.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Everybody has that.  If you guys don't have that, I would bet my family's lives that you guys have HPV.  Do you think I have it?  Yes.  I think you created it.  It doesn't show up.  It just means that I'm more at risk for cancer, for cervical cancer.  What does that do?  And that's the only cancer you could spread or something like that.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  To guys or something, right?  Well, do you have a cervix?  No, but technically...  But I've heard technically that's a cancer you could spread. 
[02:59:30]  No, it's like you could give...  You're giving HPV to other people and then give them the opportunity, that great opportunity  to get the cancer.  So technically you're spreading your cancer to somebody else.  Honestly, 94% of the population have HPV.  Wow.  All right.  But I'm proud of it.  I rock that shit.  People are like, who brought the HPV?  I'm like, this girl.  What?  HIV.  Somebody wants to know...  Well, you know what?  Stacey should ask you, Amy.  I just saw a shirt running around the reservoir of this guy.  It said, run for HIV.  I was like, don't you mean from? 
[03:00:00]  I think your shirt needs to be edited.  Stacey has a question for Amy Schumer.  Stacey.  No, it's Stacey.  Yes.  How are you, Amy?  Great.  Does your father have a big package?  Uh, thanks for asking.  Uh, yeah.  Do you want him to shove it in your face like you begged for it?  Yes.  Good talk.  Did you have to lift his balls to clean them?  I didn't deal with his, uh, junk at all.  Oh, okay.  Balls or, or...  Brewer told a story about that. 
[03:00:30]  Who's the screener, by the way?  Yeah, really?  That person was calling from Yellowstone and the name was Stacey.  Is someone just walking around the OTB with a mic right now?  What, Jimmy?  Brewer told a story about that.  About changing his daddy.  Yeah.  His dad's really old.  Yeah, we all have older parents, Amy, so we know what you're going through.  I can't comprehend it.  There's a few people in my family that had to, you know, clean up a little bit.  Yeah.  Some issues.  Really lets you know you haven't gotten anywhere.  I'm so, I'm so awful, I just wouldn't handle it well.  No?  No, there's gotta be people for that. 
[03:01:00]  You gotta pretend like it's a dog.  Like a big dog.  I'll put it to, what, and put it to sleep?  Fuck it when no one's looking.  My dad was like, why are you putting oven mitts on me?  Putting peanut butter on your genitals.  You wouldn't wipe your mom's hiney, Jimmy?  Come on, you gotta wipe her.  No, I'd fucking hose her off like in Pulp Fiction.  That's really nice.  I'd throw her in the yard.  You'd be the cleaner.  Your shirt, motherfucker.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess you do, you know? 
[03:01:30]  You gotta.  You gotta do, if nobody else is going to, you gotta do it.  You have to, right?  Yeah.  I'm hoping to make enough money at Hotel Fredonia where I can hire someone to clean my dad's  shit.  Yeah.  At least for a week.  Yeah.  People really should go see if they're in that town I've never heard of.  Yeah.  Is it a good gig?  I hope it's real.  I think it's going to be like a Hills Have Eyes situation.  Oh, my God.  I get out there, it's just people.  Yeah.  I can eat, trying to eat each other.  It's one guy just jerking off in a seat, wanting you to do your act.  I'm like, I'm still getting paid, right?  Yeah.  Well, that was depressing. 
[03:02:00]  I didn't mean to bring up such a depressing point.  What?  I always do that, though.  I don't mean to.  Well, you like truth.  You like what really happens.  Well, I'm curious.  Yeah.  Some people don't know about it, so why not?  It's weird.  You know somebody, or you hang out with somebody, and you just...  The dad with the MS?  Whatever.  I think I knew that.  You had said that before.  But it's like, you don't...  The furniture business.  I didn't...  Yeah, I lost my dad in a car accident six years ago today.  Today?  I knew that.  That's why I'm a little quiet.  Really? 
[03:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  That's right.  So what else is going on?  No, but it's like some shit's so sad, you just can't even...  No.  You know?  It's just too sad.  You can't even...  You have to laugh about it.  Me and I were talking during the break.  It's all right.  It becomes something else.  Yeah.  Whatever.  You want to trade?  What do I want to trade?  He was heading towards some bad years.  Oh, really?  So in a way, you wonder, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you know.  He was heading towards a bad place.  Well, here's something that I just experienced for the first time.  I made out, in air quotes, with a French guy. 
[03:03:00]  Ooh.  And I didn't know...  What's it called when you leave the skin there?  Gross.  Oh.  Of course.  Unappealing.  I was like, what is that?  Are we having a pillow fight?  What is that?  But you made out.  Once I got down to it, I was like...  I put my hand...  I was like, is there an ice cream cone melting?  What happens?  What the fuck?  Is this a garden, though?  You never grabbed an uncut dick before?  No.  I was so unprepared.  I was like, why is there a condom under the condom? 
[03:03:30]  I was like, what is this?  I got out.  I got out of there.  You had to leave.  You really did?  Couldn't even deal with that fucking thing.  Mission aborted.  You just jerked him off a little and left?  No.  I didn't even...  I checked it.  I couldn't.  I was so thrown off.  I had no idea.  I wasn't ready for that.  And since then, I've talked about it on stage a little bit.  Do I look like that?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Snuffleupagus.  I love this, man.  There are rules.  Just get that fix if you have that.  I don't know.  I was so thrown off.  It didn't go any further than that. 
[03:04:00]  How was the kissing and stuff?  Was it good?  I didn't like him.  I didn't want to kiss him.  I was hoping that we could just have some sex.  You know?  Without the intimacy of kissing.  Yeah.  And as a girl, that's an option.  You can be like, hey, do your job.  How old was he?  Jesus, Danny.  He was 26, which is the youngest I've ever...  But I found out, and I was with my friend.  He was like, I'm 26.  I was like, well, too late.  So he was unclipped.  Did he have a big hog or no?  I don't know. 
[03:04:30]  You just grabbed it and you were like, oh.  I was so buried by cast members of Schindler's List that I had to just get out of there.  Oh, wow.  I ran down the stairs laughing to myself.  Wait.  Now, how did you stop it, though?  Because you're...  I went, I'm sad all of a sudden.  I'm sad.  That's a great one.  And the worst is my shirt was complicated.  It was like a kind of strange tank top where you...  And I'm trying to put it on the dark.  I'm like, sorry, I'm just so upset.  And he's like, no, you're not.  I was like, miss you. 
[03:05:00]  I was like, don't be mad.  I'm sad.  I went, I'm sad.  I literally said, I'm sad.  Had you just met him or no?  No, I've known him for a while.  Okay, but you didn't know he was unclipped?  No.  And that was your first time fooling around with him?  Yeah.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Oh, that's fucking how horrible.  I ran for the hills.  See, you should learn.  Can you stop?  You just keep showing me these.  Well, we just want to know what it looks like.  You have an unclipped cock up on the monitor.  I always get offended.  Like, some guys have been like, that are uncircumcised, have been like, I've never got any complaints. 
[03:05:30]  I'm like, not to your face.  Yeah, not to your face.  Only on radio shows.  You can't hear it with those flaps in the woods.  God, what if we had a little extra something down there?  Yeah, exactly.  No, no.  Jimmy likes a little extra down there.  Once more.  Imagine going down a girl's pants and then you feel just this massive skin.  An extra skin.  You'd be like, I would go, I feel sad.  Yeah, I felt sad.  I feel sad.  Jimmy likes it looking slumpy.  I like a mess.  You have to realize that what we're comparing this to is like, if you had women that get  their pussy lips snipped, like that have big pussies and get them snipped, that to me 
[03:06:00]  is what, that's like, that's ridiculous.  You want like an open face sandwich.  Amy, does yours look like that?  What is all of that?  I love that.  An explosion at the Steakums factory.  That's not even that great though, because it's just dangling.  I like fucking meat.  Big fat lips.  Oh, meat.  Wow.  Big fat lips.  No, I'm not rocking that.  Amy, can you show us what yours looks like?  Sure.  Just point to the picture on the screen.  Oh, I went like this.  Putting her hands together.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  That's you?  That's balls.  That's a ball sack.  That is. 
[03:06:30]  With no balls inside.  Total scrotum.  I am starving.  Let's have some loose meat sandwiches.  Yeah, find a fucking pussy portrait.  Linda Might has a good clip.  Linda Might has a good clip.  She's a little older, but Linda Might has a good old pussy.  If she was younger, she'd be great.  That is fucked up.  What is that?  Which one?  That's not even right.  This one.  That's the grossest thing I've ever seen.  Which one?  That's not right.  Quick click on it.  Oh, God.  Let me see.  What do you do?  That's when you start to feel sad.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's not okay. 
[03:07:00]  That's all.  That's works.  You ever see the blue waffle?  No.  You ever see the blue waffle?  This is like one of the worst mornings of my life.  I don't watch this.  Danny, can you show her the blue waffle?  I know it's old school.  Her pussy's good.  Let's pull up the blue.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  That's not.  Black girl's a giant pussy.  No, that looks like old.  Damn.  That's rough.  That's fucking fantastic.  Looks like Al Jolson singing.  Mammy, how I love ya.  How I love ya.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, God.  Nice, right, Amy?  There you go. 
[03:07:30]  Nice, right?  It's like a little ass.  I like it like that.  A tiny little ass.  Nice.  Tiny, tiny.  I like it bigger than that.  Fucking amazing.  This girl named Rhonda, who was on the show once years ago, like in 02, had the kind  of vagina I like.  What are we talking?  She had a little penis.  She had a little penis.  Yeah, yeah.  She had a big clit.  That was the one, remember?  It was a tiny penis.  What is that?  That's the blue waffle.  That is a reason not to go in the ocean.  What is that?  I can't look at it.  Oh, I can't look at it.  It's like a sea urchin.  It is a sea urchin. 
[03:08:00]  It's like the rarest sushi.  Will you look at it?  I looked at it.  I cannot look at it again.  It looks like when you open an abalone shell.  Oh, my God.  That other picture right there is, take that.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  Is that different?  Yeah.  Oh.  Right there.  Oh, my God.  That is so gross.  Why is it blue?  Why is it crying?  It's the blue waffle.  It's blowing its nose.  Want some waffles?  That's a horrible one.  Why do they name it the blue waffle?  I get the blue part of blue waffle, but not the waffle part.  It just sounds right.  It's nauseating. 
[03:08:30]  I'm nauseous.  Hey, Chris in Houston wants to warn you about where you're going for your gig.  Oh, okay.  At Hotel Fredonia.  Yeah.  Hotel Fredonia.com.  Everyone's got a warning.  And that would be Friday, this Friday.  Yes, Chris.  I'm not really sure about the Hotel Fredonia, but Nacogdoches is a small shithole just north  of Houston.  Just fucking fire your agent or manager or whatever.  Tell them to take you to Houston.  Oh, well, you know.  I think you should be in Houston.  Maybe she's getting good money for a one-nighter. 
[03:09:00]  I would do it.  All right.  Good point.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  All right.  This guy also has info about where you're going.  Thank you.  Chris from Louisiana.  Chris.  Yeah.  From Louisiana, too.  Come on.  Say the same thing he was saying.  This place is out in the middle of nowhere.  It'll be like every other weekend for me.  The damn town is only about 15,000 people max.  All right.  If they all come to the show.  I can do some damage.  Yeah.  If everybody brings a friend, I'll make a grand. 
[03:09:30]  Why there, though?  I'm sorry, sir.  What?  Unfortunately, it's a dry county.  You've got to drive about 20 miles to buy any liquor.  Okay.  These are the kind of warnings that are important.  Now you need to know to bring some to the Fredonia Hotel there.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  From the airport.  That's the worst if you get somewhere and then you find out.  You can't drink.  Or an Indian Reservation Casino.  And they're like, oh, no, we don't have any.  You're like, well, why would people come here?  What is that?  I thought you guys were famous for drinking.  Yeah.  What kind of drunk are you?  Drinking in rain.  You're fun?  Yeah, I'm fun. 
[03:10:00]  Or raving.  I'm a fun drunk.  I'm not a crying drunk.  I'm like a good drunk.  Yeah.  No.  I'll be okay in a minute.  The only tears would be like me and a friend being like, I love you so much.  You're the best.  Look how awesome we are.  Yeah.  No, I tested positive for being a fun drunk.  Yeah, that's good.  Kenny has added more facts about Amy Schumer.  Oh, here we go.  And I think these are the real ones.  Tell Kenny, be careful.  He's going to get some facts.  Okay.  Amy Schumer eats really slow.  Oh, my God.  Fucking she's the worst. 
[03:10:30]  I forgot.  What?  They eat like it's their last meal.  Like it's a trough.  We eat normal people's feed.  I do.  And it's fucking, it's...  I'm cutting my knee.  I eat like a little old woman.  Get Kenny in here.  What do you mean?  Oh, does she fucking nibble?  I do.  You guys go to Morton's.  You guys like Morton's on the road.  Yeah.  And it takes her forever together.  Yeah, we have steak.  She has a lima bean.  We finish at the same time.  Kenny, what's up with Amy?  Oh, hey, Kenny.  Eating really slow.  You look like a game show host today. 
[03:11:00]  That's right, Amy.  Can you take a picture of him, please?  Oh, my God.  What a creepy game show.  No, she probably like takes care of herself.  She tries to be healthy.  Hey, we have worked out together.  I've seen Kenny at the gym.  Ridiculous, right?  She is too, though.  She's fucking...  Yeah, but all the working out I'm trying to do, Amy's the shape I'm trying to get into.  You want some breasts and a labia, Kenny?  All right.  Do you spin, Amy? 
[03:11:30]  What do you do for...  I do do yoga and Pilates.  Yoga?  Does yoga help with weight loss?  Pilates.  I don't know.  Like, probably.  If you do it right.  It's good.  I'm not going to therapy, so it's just good to go to yoga.  Sweat it out.  And finally...  The Pilates thing is crazy, though, right?  Pilates is good.  That's the best.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Because you use weights, right?  It's like just these weird machines.  The guy, Joseph Pilates, came up with it during World War II.  He used it, like, for injured soldiers.  And these guys were in their hospital beds. 
[03:12:00]  They got jacked.  Really?  You know, yeah.  They got in the best shape of their lives from there.  I never knew that.  Yes, well...  A little trivia.  Okay, so...  What are the facts?  There's one more.  And someone else saying that you're playing in a cool college town.  Nagadocious?  I guess.  Yeah, probably.  But it's like the Bible Belt, too.  Nobody's expecting this Friday night to be fun for me.  Yeah.  What are you flying into?  Are you flying into Houston?  And then what?  Oh, they get to see Houston.  Yeah, I will get to be there for about 10 minutes. 
[03:12:30]  That's nice.  And then, uh...  As they drive you away from the city.  Yeah, then...  See the city go by in the rearview mirror there.  Yeah, then they'll take me.  All right, Amy once had a bicycle stolen.  Oh, yeah.  My bike was once stolen.  And also the bike seat, which was way more embarrassing.  To walk at home, no bike seat.  Be like, oh, shorty, what happened?  Everyone's yelling at me.  Everyone's trashing me.  I'm like, maybe I just don't want a seat.  They're like, you got robbed.  I'm like, yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  They just took your seat? 
[03:13:00]  They just took the seat.  It was embarrassing.  Some guy's smelling it.  It's okay.  I'll ride it home for you.  Yeah.  Where are the railroad tracks?  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, I'll break.  More with Amy Schumer?  Yeah, of course.  What do you want to promote besides the gig?  Twitter?  Yeah, Twitter.  You should get more people on Twitter.  And I'll be at Rooster Tees in San Jose. 
[03:13:30]  It's a club, the 26th, 27th, 28th.  Okay, so you're doing, the 13th, you're doing it in Texas, and you're coming back and going  back to Texas?  San Jose, California.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  Yeah.  San Jose, Texas.  You're like, what does your dad have?  I was fucking up.  So wait, your mom pissed herself.  What's happening?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't know about you.  I feel bad now that we brought that up.  I brought it up.  That's true. 
[03:14:00]  I said we as the collective.  Thank you.  I think she brought it up.  Yeah, she did.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could have lied.  Nope.  Nope.  All on.  Stupid life.  Goddamn life.  Time, actually.  We fucking hate time.  Yeah.  Time's a bitch.  What else is a bitch?  I mean, not to kill that subject, but BP stock is down.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Well, it'll go back up.  Speaking of things spilling.  I know.  Speaking of cleanup.  It'll go back up, Jimmy.  Took your joke.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[03:14:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Serious.  Serious.  Serious XL.  I love what you want, though.  I'm standing out your window.  You let us just talk and I come out.  I live.  I want to show you all my love.  I want to be young, baby.  I know you like nobody ever, baby. 
[03:15:00]  But I'll just go catch you by the other way.  I'm all moving like behind the shadow.  I'll just go catch you by the other way.  I'm all moving like behind the shadow. 
[03:15:30]  Check it out.  Opie and Anthony.  Amy Schumer in studio.  What is that song?  This is good.  Which one is that, Chavis?  Little Sister, Queens of the Stone Age.  Yeah, pretty cool.  They're fucking good, man.  I'm just discovering them.  Yeah, I didn't know the name of that one.  Long story.  Hotel Fredonia in Texas.  Nako Doshis.  Nako.  Nagasaki.  Nagasaki, Texas.  That's where Amy Schumer will be Friday.  Amy's a very funny act.  A lot of people have seen it.  Yeah, but you know you're...  And you know what?  You guys work great together. 
[03:16:00]  We're totally different.  I love working with Amy.  I love working together.  Because she kills, but she's completely different.  You're in the same genre, though.  You know what I mean?  It's not like she's a clean comic.  No, not at all.  I think we compliment each other.  Huh?  Yeah, I think it compliments each other.  I think so, too, man.  Do you wear your red shoes?  Yeah.  Every time?  No.  Is that your thing?  If I do the TV taping, I wind up wearing those.  Yeah, red shoes with the heel there.  The Mary Janes.  Yeah.  The Mary Janes.  Yeah, I don't know.  I always wear those.  And I'm not a shoe guy, but I notice Amy Schoen wears those shoes.  Yeah, I like to put little innocent things, and then... 
[03:16:30]  And then just be completely generous.  I don't know if you can't see the fucking sneakers.  What, the secret of my shoes that you hate?  No, those are mine.  But Amy wears the fucking...  She's the worst traveler.  In an airport.  I look at newly homeless.  Yeah, she always wears these fucking horrendous black shoes.  I'm always Twittering pictures of her horrible shoes.  I want to fucking...  I want to hobble her feet.  That's from something I filmed.  That's not like me out on the town.  Those are like, yeah, red horseshoes.  Yeah.  There's the red shoes.  Let me see those shoes.  I was playing a girl from Staten Island in this. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, okay.  This is for a pilot called The Wake Up Call.  It's cool.  Those shoes big on you?  They look gigantic.  Yeah, I think they were big on me.  More facts coming in from Kenny.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Amy's shirt is see-through on the back.  That's right, Kenny.  Kenny, you're a real detective back there.  Look at you using your eyes.  Amy has a married sister.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  What are we supposed to do with that one, Kenny?  Kenny, your facts are getting progressively worse. 
[03:17:30]  Your facts suck.  Look at Kenny.  He's happy with himself.  Kenny.  So pleased.  I've never seen someone more pleased with you.  Can I say the next one?  This is a little dangerous.  No.  Amy is in a video about face-fucking.  I am?  What?  Yeah, that Facebook video.  Oh, Facebook.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He says, can I face-fuck you?  Yeah, this guy, there's a video.  This guy asked me.  That was the punchline.  That was the...  Hey, I didn't write it.  That's not how you wrote it.  Yeah, Kenny, that doesn't really describe what the video is. 
[03:18:00]  Right.  Thank you.  I was like, oh, my God.  Did that get out?  I just cut to the chase.  You do.  You do.  Real wordsmith.  And finally, Amy recently taped a Comedy Central special.  Well, that's good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  I produced it.  Me, Rachel Feinstein, Marina Franklin, and Nikki Glaser.  Marina.  Yeah, Nikki's a huge fan of the show.  She loves you guys.  Do I know Nikki?  Do we know Nikki?  She's great.  Yeah.  Should we have her in instead of you?  You should.  Go away, she is.  You should replace her.  She's a comic out of St. Louis.  She's moving to New York.  I don't know her.  I don't think.  I know the name Glaser. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, she was at the Cellar the other night.  I know Marina.  Marina's very funny, too.  Marina's funny.  Very funny, man.  Rachel's funny.  Yeah.  Okay, I'll have to check them out.  Oh, that's right.  I heard about the four of you doing a...  Right.  Yeah, we did a special at the Skirball Center downtown.  It's a good place.  Yeah, we filmed other stuff.  We filmed a scene where we're having a slumber party and just kept saying super racist shit.  Marina's like, what are you doing?  It was fun.  Now, that sounds fantastic.  It was.  What's the name of it? 
[03:19:00]  We don't know yet.  We don't know.  I want Ladies Who Kill, but they're like, I don't know.  For branding, they want it to be like Women's Week or I don't know.  I don't know.  It sucks.  That's a perfect name.  What?  Ladies Who Kill?  Yes.  I know.  Yeah.  I know, but whatever.  They're worried about branding.  What do you mean branding?  What's that mean?  Like somebody who's going to sponsor the tour.  If it's like Gillette Razors with a moisturizing strip, like they don't want, they might like  be worried about the word kill.  It doesn't make sense to me and it's the only name I like. 
[03:19:30]  They just overthink everything.  I know.  I know.  It sucks.  Women Who Kill is fine or Ladies Who Kill.  Anything Who Kill is good.  Yeah.  It's a comedy term.  We both said it together.  What?  I suck first.  Oh, wow.  You guys got right into it.  I got it.  Oh, great, Kenny.  Hopefully AIDS.  Women Who Menstruate sponsored by tampons.  That's really helpful, Kenny.  Sure.  Thank you.  You should work at an advertising agency for people who are retarded.  Oh, God.  Look at Kenny. 
[03:20:00]  Kenny is loving it.  Women Who Administrate.  Oh, God.  It's terrific, right, Kenny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I contribute.  You are great.  What a wonderful member of society.  Is Amy having a good appearance today?  Amy's terrific wherever she is.  Can we pat you on the back?  Oh, no.  Damn it.  No, thanks.  Will you let Kenny hug you?  I'd rather not.  Yeah.  I saw Amy's in a bikini.  Yeah?  What does that look like?  You saw Amy's in a bikini?  He was drunk.  He saw a couple of me. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, okay.  Double vision.  You guys go to the pool together?  Yeah.  When you're on the road?  Once.  Kenny and I vacation together.  Yeah.  I hole up in the room.  He leaves me with Kenny.  And then you two at the powerhouse.  Jim's like, oh, yeah, we'll have a blast.  And then I see him for an hour a night.  Yeah.  The rest of the time.  Me and Amy annoy people in the hotel like a bickering couple.  No.  You scream at me across the lobby or the pool, my full name and my room number.  How embarrassing.  Both of them, in a best bike, both Jim and Kenny will be like, hey, they just started 
[03:21:00]  screaming my name.  Oh, God.  Really humiliating.  Embarrassing.  I'm fucking tired today, man.  I'm sorry.  Everybody is just shot today.  Yeah.  I start to fuck late at night sometimes.  Yeah?  I couldn't even blow less.  I couldn't even, I was just like, I fucked for a few minutes.  I was like, I'm just terrible right now.  You said, I'm sad all of a sudden.  No, I was, yeah.  My foreseen grew back.  Oh, shucks.  Are you constantly apologizing?  For sex?  Yeah.  No, I was, I mean, I wasn't like, every time you bring it up, it's like, what a lousy 
[03:21:30]  fuck I threw last time.  No, no, no.  I just, I had my heart on.  I just, I just knew I couldn't come.  It was one of those things where I was like, I'm not going to have a job.  You were just too tired?  Yeah.  And I was just like distracted and stuff about some weird, it's like, I was, I could fuck,  but I was like, ugh, I had no inspiration.  How do you not come, though?  How do you not come?  Easy.  I know, I know.  I've been edging so long, jerking off, but it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I want to just wash my dick in the sink.  We chatted.  Oh, God.  You talked about your feelings?  No, not really. 
[03:22:00]  We had fought, I guess we were both adoring each other, but way, way underlying.  Why'd you wash?  That makes the fucking the best.  She's on a period.  Good for you.  Good for you.  You're hurting your wings.  This is what I'm talking about.  I've been doing that more.  Like the last, last period, I fucking dipped like twice in three days.  Dipped.  Good, good boy.  Yeah, it was good.  Great work.  You're a dipper.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, one one was bad, too.  It was like, it was really dim, and I could look down and see the fucking, oh, no wonder 
[03:22:30]  this is so...  Some pieces of her uterus.  Did you dip with like a Maker's Mark bottle?  That's my favorite.  Once a month, I'm like, I play the game.  I must have just gotten it.  The prize is New Jersey Sheets.  Do you like...  Yeah, you allow guys to dip?  Totally.  Oh, God.  That's very bad.  Things would have to be pretty bad for me to...  Oh, you like to bang on the period?  Okay, that's...  Yeah.  My girlfriend, too.  It's just that time of month, you're so... 
[03:23:00]  You're like, so horny.  Like, the first day, I'm like, get out of here.  I don't even want to see anybody.  But then I'm like, let's do this.  Are most guys cool with it or not?  Because for me, it's like, I'm not screaming.  I'm a filth bag, but the period is always gone.  That's it for you.  Yeah, that's your thing.  I've never had a problem with that.  Well, you're never...  Yeah, the thing is, that would be a problem.  A little bit.  I like a guy who's dirty and isn't, like, doesn't get...  If a guy gets grossed out easily...  It doesn't matter.  I'm like, all right.  Only by the period I do.  You can piss in my mouth.  Yeah, what's the matter, Jim?  It's only blood. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, God, don't do...  What is he doing?  He said some jokes.  What a horrible person.  What is he doing?  He's setting up his joke.  If you sprayed luminol in my room, it would look like a Peter Max poster.  It looks like...  Just DNA all over.  Cops with ced blood.  Learned it on CSI.  It just looks like a murder.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  So have guys you've dated been, like, ever squeamish about it?  No one that I've dated...  No, no one that I've dated for a long time.  Yeah.  Because I'm super comfortable with most things, so I need that from them, too. 
[03:24:00]  Like, one of the problems with the French guy, he was, like...  He, like, kind of lost his confidence at one point.  Oh.  I was, like, don't look at me.  Don't look at me.  You said don't look at me?  Yeah.  I probably knew that's stupid.  Why?  If I'm grabbing for a knife.  Don't look at me, Mr. Sean.  No, but I do.  I, like, want the lights on and...  You know, because who gives a shit?  You know?  See, yeah, I'm so the opposite.  Like, I don't need the lights off.  Yeah.  I like it dim. 
[03:24:30]  It has to feel...  wrong.  Yeah.  Oh, you are awful.  Well, then don't you like medical lighting?  Just, like, a horrible...  No.  It looks like an American apparel shoot.  Like, somebody's going to end up dead.  Just, like, snuff.  A flickering fluorescent.  Snuff is in the air.  No, I like it...  I like...  I like light.  I like to see.  But I like it to be dim.  It has to be wrong, though.  Yeah, it's...  I like a blinking hotel light outside my window.  Yeah.  An hourly rate.  Yeah.  Wow, you like the lights on full, huh?  That's weird.  I can't...  I like lights. 
[03:25:00]  I need to see.  You like the lights on?  I need to look.  I swear to God.  I'll spend...  Not even...  I'll probably spend 90% of the time looking down and 10% looking at the girl's face.  Now, your dick going in.  Oh, that's nice.  That's sweet.  It's fucking...  Does nothing for me.  No, no.  It's good.  You gotta look at the whole...  Not just my dick going.  I'm like, I isolate it.  You're like, look at that dick.  Tunnel vision.  Look at that.  My dick.  No, I can look at my dick any time.  Can you get out of the way, sweetheart?  I got a better look at this.  In the context of it, going in and out of a pussy is a little different.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, man.  We're so different.  That's, uh...  You guys could never fuck each other.  I know.  Oh, my God.  I've gotten so desensitized.  It's gotten so weird for me, sex.  It's so...  Yeah, there has to be...  If there's no shame involved, what are we doing?  Waste each other's time.  See, that's silly.  That's why I always found it weird that you didn't like period sex.  No, because I'm too scent-oriented, and I'm too fucking oral.  Like, I like no shower.  Like, no deodorant.  Yeah, yeah, silly.  Yeah, it's fine.  But so anything foreign?  The pussy smells different on the period?  I've laid in my own filth with a girl for fucking days on end of bed. 
[03:26:00]  Just fucking...  We're just both, like, smelling the pillow and the...  Just take out and pussy.  Oh, we stink.  Let's fuck again.  Yeah.  It's great.  And then period sex.  I don't care if Jackie O's picking up brain pieces.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  You know that doesn't bother you at all?  No.  I love it.  Do you just throw the sheets away?  That is so funny.  No.  And she's yelled at me a few times, because she has to do my laundry.  Yeah.  She's like, what the fuck happened upstairs? 
[03:26:30]  Just take a flame to it.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I think Anne's probably the best bang in the room.  No.  I would say that.  I think so.  Oh, my God.  Absolutely.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I enjoy...  What about Amy, man?  Oh, come on.  Come on.  What?  What?  He's helping you out with visuals.  That is...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, that is a bad one.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  I've never seen that much.  No?  No.  What happened?  Well, I don't want to see it. 
[03:27:00]  I wish I liked it.  I wish it turned me on.  I'm so dirty.  No, that doesn't do anything for me.  Maybe he's just finger painting.  Yeah, that's it.  Just consider.  How many milligrams is her flow?  Oh, my God.  Bleeding betwixt the legs.  That's a tab.  That is really bad.  That's a lot.  That is really gross.  Yeah.  That's a problem.  That isn't normal.  Anything else you want to see on the internet today, Amy?  That's too heavy.  You guys have really, really shown me a lot today.  I just can't.  That's great.  He can find anything on the internet.  I just can't do that.  It takes a real wizard to pull up Google.  Have you ever seen a shit hat? 
[03:27:30]  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Have you ever seen the shit hat?  Oh, you know what?  Can I pass?  Can I use my pass on this one?  Where the shit is so heavy.  I saw the blue oyster cunt.  Do I have to see?  Blue oyster?  Holy shit.  Does this have to happen?  That is a better name than Blue Waffle Oyster Cunt.  That was the grossest.  That does not look to the imagination, if you call it that.  Oh, that's great.  See what?  Yeah.  Tub Girl?  Oh, you've seen Tub Girl.  Oh, yeah.  Tub Girl's disgusting. 
[03:28:00]  No, I don't want to see it.  Can I opt out?  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.  What is that?  You've never seen Tub Girl?  What?  That's Tub Girl.  That's what they do in Asia.  Look, in some places in Asia.  If I ever had any interest in getting involved with another woman, it is over.  I'm not looking again.  They pixelated the pussy out because they want to keep it nice and nice.  It's getting clean for everybody.  It's not even...  Amy, look at the face.  Jimmy, I'm not falling for it. 
[03:28:30]  You guys are liars.  No, he got rid of the picture.  Now it's just your plug for the Texas gig.  It really is.  Nobody believes you.  We just got your plug up there so you can read it nice.  I am not looking at that.  So you've never seen Tub Girl before?  No.  Two Girls, One Cup you've seen.  Yeah.  Sure, I'm an American.  Tub Girl.  I am not going to look at Tub Girl.  Have you seen Lemon Party?  Come on.  Haven't I had enough?  Lemon Party is actually kind of hot.  Yeah, because we're trying to figure out who the luckiest fella in the picture is.  Yeah.  Do you want to help us with this one?  This is not gross, I promise. 
[03:29:00]  It's like Mega Touch.  What's different?  The Open Wounds?  The Open Wounds.  Here, Lemon Party.  Oh, I've seen Lemon Party.  Oh, yeah.  It's wonderful.  Now, which guy...  I love 70s porn.  Which guy...  They're in their 70s, right?  Who's the gayest guy in that photo?  And who's like...  The guy kissing.  Yeah, that's what we say, too.  Is that guy Asian or just really tired?  No, he's just old.  Yeah, that's the guy kissing.  The guy kissing.  And with a hand on his...  It looks like he wants to kiss him on his heart.  That's like the really gay thing. 
[03:29:30]  The other guy just looks like he's taking his medicine.  He's like, is this where it is?  He thinks he is.  Right.  Oh, God.  All right, back to Tub Girl.  No!  Why can't you discuss Tub Girl with us?  I am going to throw up...  Like a gentleman.  I refuse.  I'm not looking.  All right, this isn't Tub Girl.  That's not Tub Girl.  That one grosses Bob Kelly out, though.  Yeah, I promise.  What is that?  Guy opening his own asshole.  Jesus.  Is that a real picture?  Oh, yeah.  I can't be.  That's real, huh?  Yeah, that guy's fucking...  Yeah, if Bobby was here, you'd be hearing... 
[03:30:00]  Me!  Me!  You ever see Bob Puke?  Oh, it's the funniest thing.  It's the...  It's the...  Oh, wait, yes.  I think I've seen a video of him.  I'm not looking.  Amy, don't look.  I'm not looking.  How about one guy, one jar?  You've got to look, though.  Do you see that?  Show her one guy, one jar.  Oh, no.  Even I have a problem with that one.  Oh, come on.  What are you fucking...  One guy, one jar is rough.  Show her.  Have some laughs.  That one's rough.  Have some laughs in this room.  This is horrible.  That one's rough.  It really is bad.  This is a horrible morning.  I can't look at a lot of this shit.  One guy, one jar, for Pete's sake. 
[03:30:30]  Can I just for one second pull up a picture of a puppy?  A cute kitten or something?  Coming out of a guy's asshole.  Yeah, we got that.  It was refreshing to see those three old guys.  I was like, oh, some romance.  Some romance.  They cleansed the palace, and now we can go back to the nasty.  Oh, a baby porcupine.  I'll bring it all back.  I'll bring it back.  Yeah, look at Danny.  But even those look like little assholes right now.  Yeah, they really do.  Are they porcupine?  How come they're not poking the man's hand?  They're so good on their babies.  Yeah, there's no...  Let me see the baby on the thumb real quick.  Baby porcupine.  The baby on the thumb.  Did you ever see Snickers? 
[03:31:00]  Oh, look at that.  That's adorable.  I want one of those now.  Oh, wrinkly.  That's cute.  How do we get a fucking porcupine in New York City?  You guys need a porcupine.  I don't think they're allowed.  I want one that little, too.  Considered a weapon.  I want to pet one with a fucking glove.  All right, here's...  I think this is it.  Oh, I don't even want to watch it.  Let me see this.  Okay, I don't know.  No, look.  Stop it.  Watch.  He's unclipped, so it's sexy.  Look.  He's just sitting at a jar.  Amy, it's not that bad.  Just watch.  Stop right there.  He's pushing the jar in. 
[03:31:30]  Look at how much he can take in his butt.  That's all it is.  That's not where I thought that was going to go.  No, it's not what you can take.  It's nothing.  Show her.  You've gotten past the bad part.  Watch how much he can take.  That's the amazing part.  Yeah, you've gotten past the bad part.  Look at what you can take.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm really like...  No, it's not bad.  Look at what he can take.  It's so early.  If you want another plug, you'll watch.  Come on, you've got to be one of the guys.  For another plug, I have to watch this guy plug.  Yes, you do.  Look at how much this guy's...  How does a guy take this in his fucking asshole?  Look.  Come on.  No, something's...  Come on.  You're thinking there's no way he could take more, but guess what? 
[03:32:00]  He does, Amy.  He does.  See?  Sits right down on...  Oh, come on.  Look, he's...  Oh, God.  Did it break in his ass?  Yeah.  Yeah, it might have.  Yeah, but now he...  Oh, my God.  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  Amy, for a plug.  For your plug.  For your plug.  I'm quitting comedy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  He's got to get the broken...  That's how I feel on the period.  This guy get the broken glass out of his hiney.  That's all.  No.  No more. 
[03:32:30]  Amy's tapping out.  Look how calm he is, though.  Why do you guys want to ruin my life?  This guy's handling a situation.  Look, he's very calm.  Yeah.  Would you be calm in a situation like that?  I don't think so.  I understand.  I'm dissociating right now.  I'm trying to develop multiple personalities right now.  Tosh 1.0 is trying to figure out how to work the front of the show.  Right.  Thanks, guys.  I can't look at this.  Look, he's still very calm.  I feel like I physically want to die.  You're missing the part where he starts bleeding out. 
[03:33:00]  What's wrong with you?  I've been seeing him bleed out.  I get it.  I don't like the fact that you can hear the glass crinkling inside.  I don't like any of this.  This guy's handling it.  He's got terrible abs, so...  What a gut.  I could throw up no problem right now.  Really?  I just had to take a drink of water.  Okay.  Come on.  Come on.  Turn it off.  I don't want to kill her, but that's...  You know what, Amy?  You're wanting to hang with the boys today.  What's wrong with you?  I just don't have a video left.  Never mind.  I want shopping.  I want shoes.  I want to talk about girl things.  Pedicures, right? 
[03:33:30]  I'm going to start watching more reality shows.  That's a weird...  What an odd thing for him to do, though.  Is that your line right there, Amy?  That's rough, huh?  That's way beyond my line.  But he's not panicking.  See, for me, I can't watch beheading videos.  Jimmy can, though.  The burned alive videos are the worst.  I can't watch that either.  You guys are AIDS.  Yeah, that's terrible.  That is pretty terrible.  Okay, can we please...  Just move the monitor.  I can't look at that anymore.  No, I don't even want to see a baby porcupine.  No, they're so cute, though. 
[03:34:00]  I am not.  I think we got one coming out of a guy's ass.  God damn it.  Could you just get it off the screen?  How did Bob handle that one?  Did he handle that badly?  Not good.  Oh, my God, dude.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.  You ever seen one guy, one screwdriver?  No more.  What?  No.  Are you tapping out?  I am so tapping out.  Show her Snicker.  I'm going to...  You want to see Snickers?  Oh, no.  I promise you'll like Snickers.  You'll like Snickers.  Snickers is good.  Snickers is good.  Snickers is adorable.  You guys are saying Snicker, right? 
[03:34:30]  No, it's Snickers.  Snickers, I guess.  Yeah.  Little baby Snickers.  He's our favorite little...  Your little...  This will make me feel better.  Isn't he adorable?  He just crawls around and...  Guys, I'm bracing myself.  Now even cute things.  He just climbs up on people.  Now you're shell shot.  The brainwashing has been a success because now she's not sure what she's looking at.  I'm just scared he's going to attack someone's asshole.  That'd be great.  When porcupines attack. 
[03:35:00]  He's cute.  Yeah.  He gets up on his little hind legs.  Thank you.  You might want to turn away in about 10 seconds.  No!  Are you serious?  Somebody pulled out a shotgun.  Oh my God.  Make some Snickers in front of a family.  Out of control skier decapitates Snickers.  How funny would that be if some hunter just came out and blasted him in a machine gun?  Pumped like 60 rounds in a Snickers.  A machete to his head.  People are enjoying your line, I'm quitting comedy.  Thanks, guys.  This means the world. 
[03:35:30]  I found my voice today and it's nothing.  It's silence.  I'm kind of bummed.  I thought you could hang with us.  Oh, no.  You've proven us shit.  I did not mean to give that impression at all.  What is going on here?  You want...  What?  They put fishes in...  Oh, come on.  They're putting eels in someone's ass.  I don't understand the attraction to that.  I could get down.  That's Asian shit.  Yeah.  The Asians aren't happy unless somebody's really unhappy.  Yeah, the Asians are weird.  You really have to specify what kind of eel you want.  That's disgusting.  Oh, fuck.  That is so disgusting.  Barbecue. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, Captain.  They put creatures in our bodies.  What would you...  Who jerks off to this?  It wraps itself around these cerebral...  Sushi aficionados.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  It shot out.  What?  They're just terrible people.  You've got to get rid of the eels.  Terrible people.  You can't just leave them in there.  All right.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  All right.  Enough.  It looks like they're swimming upstream.  What's wrong with you guys?  Look at the girl laughing.  Oh, this is fun.  Yeah.  If they can laugh, we can laugh.  It looks like salmon jumping out.  Yes. 
[03:36:30]  Jumping out of the water trying to swim upstream.  It reminds me of the Delaware.  Oh.  That was a lot of eels in there.  It's like a clown car.  How many eels do you think you could take?  Oh, I could take at least three eels.  No problem.  Oh.  No problem.  Fucking A.V.  rules.  Oh, God.  That's the issue of rules.  They're just dancing around.  You want to talk about current events now?  Oh, yeah.  What's going on in politics?  Boo.  Oh.  Oh, T-Storm has Bobby's one guy, one jar reaction. 
[03:37:00]  Really good video of it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Bobby.  Let's hear Bobby.  Listen to the video.  This is how Bobby handled it.  Okay.  By the way, you handled it better than Bobby.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone did.  I'll give that away right off the bat.  Oh, God.  This is Bobby.  All right.  The video's playing.  We're just going to let it unfold in front of us.  Let it play.  Okay.  Keep looking, Bobby.  Watch this.  Oh.  Come on.  Just watch.  No.  Just keep looking.  Oh, no.  It doesn't.  No.  Just watch.  Just watch.  No.  Keep it clean for the radio, by the way.  Oh, my God. 
[03:37:30]  No.  He tells you guys are going to have to fuck him.  There's no jar now.  What happened to the jar?  He'd be saying yes.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Bobby, watch.  Bobby, watch.  Bobby, watch.  Bobby, you got to look.  Bobby, you got to look.  No, look.  Look, Bobby.  Hold on.  Wait.  Oh, no.  I'm totally puking.  No. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my God.  He's puking up the breakfast he just ate.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, dude.  Is that a pickle jar?  He wants to go get a jar.  He can still be funny.  Wow.  How great is this guy?  Oh, God.  He can still be funny. 
[03:38:30]  All right, Danny.  Back up the video.  Because, unfortunately, he missed a bunch of the goodness.  Yeah.  Back it up a little bit.  Did he actually see the...  Bobby?  Bobby.  Yeah.  Keep it very vague, please.  We're not answering any of your questions.  All right.  Did you back up the video?  Now, Bobby.  Bobby, will you turn and look, please?  Something's so wrong.  All right.  Just turn and look.  Here we go.  We're going to try this again.  Is this guy all right?  You know he's concerned.  Yeah, you know.  What a sweetheart.  But just... 
[03:39:00]  All right, breathe.  Okay, breathe.  Heavy breathing.  We're going to push play again.  You're okay.  We're to the part where the jar has disappeared.  All right, go ahead.  All right, here we go.  Don't even try to describe it.  He's got tears in his eyes, Bobby.  All right, watch.  Watch, watch.  No big deal.  Stay with it.  Stay with it.  Stay with it.  Oh, my God.  It goes on for a while, but we're back live with Amy Schumer.  My favorite was...  Yeah.  My favorite was...  Oh, is he the best when he throws up? 
[03:39:30]  He's making the yell noises.  Yeah, he's fantastic when he throws up.  Fantastic.  People's reaction to those kind of videos are interesting, man.  It's fucking...  Oh, it makes me laugh so much.  It's funny, but it's like you got really gross.  I guess women always get grossed out.  I feel like I just had a physical experience.  Like, I was just on a roller coaster I wasn't prepared for.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm queasy.  It was scarier than I thought.  I'm a little queasy.  I think you can handle Tub Girl now.  No, I glimpsed at Tub Girl.  I think you can go back to Tub Girl.  There's no way Tub Girl...  I've had enough.  I am tapping out. 
[03:40:00]  I've had violence do that to me.  Like, I've watched a couple...  There's a couple...  One of them was so bad that I literally...  And I had already seen it before that I had to put my computer down and stand up.  I thought I was going to faint.  Wow.  From a beheading or something?  No, no.  It was a murder, but it was a terrible, terrible graphic murder.  That's the shit I can't watch.  I had to stand up.  At all.  I was happy it made me feel that way.  I was like, wow.  I can still feel.  I am human.  I can still feel.  That's what I have to do.  When me and my girlfriend argue, I put that on.  I'm like, ah.  Then I go talk to her.  I'm sorry, honey. 
[03:40:30]  I know.  She's like, what do you have a heart on for?  That's a long story.  Don't ask questions.  Jump on board.  Well, fuck, Amy.  Come back and see us soon, man.  Thanks.  It's been too long.  Amy Schumer rules.  Good friend of the show and a very funny comic.  Was this your least favorite radio appearance ever?  No, but it's up there.  Have you had any bad ones on the road?  I had a bad one yesterday.  What was the bad one?  I did a show called Man Cow.  Have you heard of that show?  What did that douchebag do? 
[03:41:00]  We hate that fucking guy.  Oh, really?  It was the, he called me because I was like 10, 30 in the morning.  Because he's a fucking phone.  And he's like, Amy, why don't you come on the show?  I didn't know anything about it, so I wasn't prepared.  So he's like, Amy, what are you doing?  You take it to the road.  And I was like, oh, well, first of all, I don't call it taking it to the road.  So I should start there.  And then it was all these like sound effects.  Yeah.  And then he was like, and you, and what do you say?  You, he goes, what do you talk about mostly?  And I was like, my genitals, my private parts. 
[03:41:30]  And then they cut me off.  Oh, what do you mean?  That was the end of your appearance?  They hung up on me.  Uh, you know, I'm a Christian now, and I don't need people like that on my program.  It was all sound effects.  It was like really weird.  And I was just like, what?  He's a clown.  He's an asshole.  He's a radio clown.  It was, it was, yeah.  Why'd they call you?  Were you scheduled or was it?  Oh, you were okay.  Yeah, I was scheduled.  What a douche.  It was like, I was just like, all right.  Yeah, that was bad.  He doesn't know what he's doing anymore. 
[03:42:00]  He used to have like a wacky show that was all about sex.  Yeah.  Made a lot of money doing that.  And then he decided to.  That's the whole thing.  Become like this, he wants to be like a political conservative talk show host.  And that wasn't working well, so now he's sort of going back to what he used to.  No one gives him any credibility.  He's confused.  But then he's worried about like, like dirtiness on the radio because he has kids now.  Oh, really?  I didn't know any of that.  All I know is that he was like being like really show, show busy.  And I just like.  Show busy.  So I tried to like level the playing field by talking about my pussy. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, of course.  And then he hung up on me.  That is the great equalizer in a conversation.  I have a cunt.  Right.  I have a cunt.  What about this wound that won't heal?  So what are you doing to take it to the road?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What a nightmare.  I was like, what are you talking about?  Does anybody say that?  Right.  I'm bad on the phone.  I'm a bad phone guest, though.  You are?  I stink on the phone.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm really a bad phone guest.  You're good on the phone.  You guys continue.  No, I'm not.  Continue talking. 
[03:43:00]  I'm really bad on the phone.  Yeah, we just start packing up.  Yeah, you guys are like in the car.  Yeah, talk to Amy about how bad you are on the phone.  Yeah.  Let's just start packing our shit up.  Then I come back again and they're out of the door.  Great.  I've just never been able to keep people's interest when I talk.  Why?  Because your best friends are leaving while you're mid-sentence.  We're just packing our shit up while you're talking about your hotelfredonia.com for Amy Schumer.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, Amy, Friday.
