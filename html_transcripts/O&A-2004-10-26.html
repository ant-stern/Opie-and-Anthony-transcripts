<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a spoken-word piece about New York City, immediately transitioning into a scathing, profanity-laced mockery of Tony Danza's talk show, criticizing its perceived inauthenticity and overly positive tone.  The hosts highlighted clips showcasing Danza's supposedly generic responses to tragedies, using derogatory terms throughout this segment.  They then shifted to a discussion of the newly released Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, expressing their anticipation for the game and predicting negative media backlash.  Numerous callers shared their experiences with the game, detailing their children's engagement with its violent content, ranging from a five-year-old carjacking to older children enthusiastically killing virtual characters.  This led to a conversation about the maturity levels of children and their ability to handle violent video games.

A Huntington Station police officer, Rob, called in to describe the pervasive gang violence in his town, mentioning specific gangs like Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, and MS-13, drawing comparisons between the real-life gang activity and the game's violence.  He even mentioned a rumor of an MS-13 and Al-Qaeda alliance.  The conversation then abruptly turned to Ashley Simpson's lip-syncing scandal at the Radio Music Awards, with the hosts and callers expressing their disgust using vulgar language.  Clips from the awards show were played, and the hosts discussed Simpson's explanation of acid reflux and her perceived lack of talent.  A prank call to a bar was also mentioned.  The discussion broadened to include both Jessica and Ashley Simpson, their appearances, and perceived lack of intelligence, sparking further vulgar exchanges with callers, including one, Jeremy, who objected to their criticism of Jessica Simpson.  A recurring character, Tony, contributed random, often nonsensical and racially charged comments. Another caller's criticism of a host's vocabulary resulted in an insult exchange.

The show featured a rivalry segment against a competing satellite radio service (Sirius), boasting about upcoming announcements and mocking Sirius's technology and marketing.  A listener, Wes, called in to support their claims. Anthony detailed his successful day trading of Google stock options, resulting in a $6000 profit, while simultaneously losing money in online poker, explaining the process of stock options. Opie discussed his own unsuccessful stock investments.  A call from Carlos Mencia followed, leading to a lengthy, rambling conversation filled with sexually explicit and racially charged humor, focusing on Mencia’s family life, including anecdotes about his parents' sex life and his mother's numerous pregnancies.  The conversation also touched on Mencia’s career.  The segment concluded with more vulgar jokes, XM radio promotions, a bit about a crazy uncle, Stephen Lynch's song "I Kissed You on the Cheek," and a discussion about the racist nature of the *Fat Albert* cartoon.

The show continued with a promotion for their XM Radio show followed by a bizarre, sexually explicit bit involving a female guest, Raquel, and a fecal-related act.  Frenchie called to complain about Martini Steve's clothing, sparking a heated exchange filled with homophobic slurs, threats of violence, and crude sexual remarks.  Max the Trucker joined the call, escalating the offensive conversation.  The hosts intervened, ending Frenchie's participation with a mock-breakup speech.  A caller, Chad, was kept on hold for an extended period, his snoring becoming a running gag.  The discussion then shifted to a list of the "top ten geekiest hobbies," from a website, including descriptions laced with humor and crude jokes.  Musical interludes, including a Stephen Lynch song about Dungeons & Dragons, were incorporated. Callers contributed midget sightings and off-color anecdotes. A story involving Opie, Anthony, and Barry Williams was recounted.  Chad's call ended due to a dying phone battery.

The show then discussed things that might upset parents, escalating to darkly humorous suggestions of killing a child.  The conversation shifted to Scott Peterson's birthday and attempts to reach Eric Logan, who was in a meeting concerning a significant XM radio announcement.  The hosts discussed the upcoming press conference and their lack of Grand Theft Auto game copies.  A video of children LARPing was shown, prompting further jokes. A listener called to report seeing an XM commercial for the show on CNBC.  Another call from "Chad" in Sacramento ended due to a dead battery.  Nonsensical chatter followed, including references to coffins.  Phil Austin from Des Moines thanked the show for playing his music, followed by XM Unsigned program director Pat DiNizio expressing gratitude.  A humorous segment about a voiceover for a "20 on 20 Interactive Countdown" followed, featuring a chaotic interaction between the voiceover artist and director "Jim."  Announcements for XM Satellite Radio's Major League Baseball coverage and a promotional jingle were aired.  An attempt to have a last-minute segment with a woman outside the studio was made, followed by listener calls detailing what they learned from the show.  Elizabeth Snow, a Playboy Lingerie model, entered the studio, engaging in sexually explicit jokes and requests with the hosts; she showed off her bikini bottom.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the upcoming election and her presidential choice, interwoven with suggestive humor.  The show ended with promotional announcements for XM Satellite Radio and a final, bizarre customer service call skit.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  No arrests have been made. Police are still investigating.  Hold it! Hold it! 
[00:05:00]  Let's do it!  The blonde one.  The so-called radio shock jocks.  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock? 
[00:05:30]  The O.P. Dance Me Show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Pediatric diabetes.  This is great.  It was unbelievable.  Hey, look.  Natalie Cole, Beyoncé, and Halle Berry.  I made out with all three of those women.  You win!  I believe it.  You know, I don't know if you know, this has been my dream to have Sidney Fortier come here and sit here and talk to me. 
[00:06:00]  And I'm wearing him down.  I'm telling you, I can tell.  You can tell.  My 11-year-old was elected to the student council.  I hope she gets assassinated.  Little bitch.  Little twat.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:06:30]  Enough.  Some of the applause breaks from Tony Danza's show yesterday.  We're obsessed with the Tony Danza show.  That audience must just walk out with chopped meat bloodied hands.  Oh, we got to clap at everything.  That's stupid Dago.  Everything he says.  Shut up.  We have to clap.  You dullard.  Why do they keep turning on that applause sign?  Oh, God.  He's not saying anything, but they're making us applause.  It's like a special child doing something.  You know, whatever they do, you got to applaud it. 
[00:07:00]  And he's quite the retard himself.  Oh, look.  He smiled.  Yeah.  I'm trying to string a sentence together.  Oh, Tony.  Hey, Tony.  He did it.  Takes words and puts them together and almost conveys an idea.  He's cute.  Then I took my golden glove's fist and put it right in Judd Hirsch's Jew nose.  Oh, Tony.  Come on.  He means it good-naturedly.  Of course he does. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  We're here, and thanks for checking us out.  Thanks for turning on your XM satellite radio.  We got to say hi to all the new listeners every morning, right, Anthony?  That's right.  As the show gets more gooder.  More gooder.  As we slowly but surely put our radio careers back together.  Right.  Gluing it back together piece by piece.  Piece by piece.  We have lots to do today.  I'm looking at our one sheet, Anthony.  The one sheet.  One sheet, yes.  Of course, the socks and the cards go at it tonight.  In the NFL, Monday Night Football, according to the intern. 
[00:08:00]  Let me say, the intern makes this thing up.  According to the intern, the Bengals beat the Broncos 23-10.  Hey, how about that?  How about the Bengals beating the Broncos 23-10 in Monday Night Football?  I didn't think they had it in them.  They always looked skinny in their videos, you know?  How many passing yards did Susanna Hoff have last night, you idiot?  Jesus.  The Bengals.  He wrote the Bengals.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  The Bengals beat the Broncos 23-10.  Was it a manic Monday Night game?  Yes.  Walking like an Egyptian over the goal line.  Wasn't a hazy shade of winter.  What?  That one didn't work as well, I know.  The Bengals.  You do know it's the Bengals, right?  They won like Egyptians right through the defense of the Denver Broncos.  Of course.  I don't like the fact that you know the Bengals deep tracks.  Not the deep tracks.  The other one. 
[00:09:00]  Hazy Shade of Winter was an old...  It was a huge hit.  Yes, it was.  It was a remake that was originally done by Simon and Garfunkel, or maybe Simon by himself,  because...  Sorry, it's not Sabbath.  Exactly.  Why would I know that?  It's Sabbath.  If you knew what she wants, it would be a touchdown.  See, that's a deep track.  No, in your room would be a deep track.  Yeah.  That was a deep track.  All right.  Well, congratulations to the Bengals.  Big win last night.  Jesus.  Susanna Hoffs at quarterback.  I thought I was half asleep for the first hour.  My God.  Susanna Hoffs was pretty good. 
[00:09:30]  And boy, surrounded by those other girls, she really looked good.  Yeah, some of them were beastly.  It's so hard to get a chick band together where they're all hot.  I mean, Susanna Hoffs, front girl.  Bananarama kind of...  No.  They were really a little rough around the edges.  Bananarama looked great in their videos from a distance.  What about...  The second they walked a little close, it was...  What about salt and pepper?  No.  No?  Beasts.  I like...  Beastly.  Salt and pepper.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh. 
[00:10:00]  Just beastly women.  I think Eternal Flame's a good song.  I like that one.  You like that one?  I do.  Eternal Flame?  I wish I was on Tony's show, because I would have said that and they all would have clapped.  You know what I like?  I like the song Eternal Flame.  That's a good song.  Yeah, Tony.  That's great.  Hey, did you hear the Bengals won over Denver last night?  The Bengals, huh, Tony?  You fucking retard.  Yeah, he would say that.  That show is like...  It's like a goof.  Like somebody said, let me see how awful... 
[00:10:30]  ...a show I can put together.  Oh, you just picture the guys in the pitch meeting.  Guys, listen.  We get this idiot, this blithering idiot on television to work a talk show.  It's like those reality shows where the person doesn't know he's in a reality show.  Who can we get?  Who's the biggest retard in Hollywood that we can get to do this?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  It's Tony Danza, everyone.  One, we'll prop him up in front of a camera, give him a little sidekick, and he could do 
[00:11:00]  a talk show.  He'll actually think he's doing a talk show, but we'll all be laughing at him.  I saw that show when it was called Rosie O'Donnell.  Yeah, before she turned into a big bull dyke, she was doing this.  It's the whole good-natured appeal to the Midwest women, the rubes, who remember watching him  in taxi, a Riga, I'm taking Camp 5.  Hey, there you go.  That's great.  I remember that.  Well, we found a website.  One of our listeners, you know, the listeners are a part of this radio show. 
[00:11:30]  We call it the People's Radio Show, and they help us with show prep, which means...  That sounds communist, but I like it.  I know.  The People's Radio Show.  You know, that means we don't have to work as hard.  There you go.  The key to Anthony and I is to work less and become bigger.  Work less, become bigger, more gooder.  More gooder.  Right.  So one of our fine fans turned us on to the Tony Danza website, where they just mocked  the TV show.  Yeah.  They put together a bunch of clips. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, there's all sorts of sections, like Tony talks about things we don't care about.  And here's a couple examples.  My daughter's a big reader, my Emily.  In fact, she got 100 on her reading test yesterday.  Congratulations, Emmy.  Oh, yeah.  He's telling people.  That his daughter got 100 on her reading test.  Like anyone cares.  And the Post, the Sunday Post gave this show a great rating.  Post, who cares?  You know what that show needs? 
[00:12:30]  You remember in Scarface, when that big fat thing is dancing on the stage, and those two  guys open up with semi-automatic weapons?  That's what the Tony Danza audience needs.  A little gunfire.  Tony's standing there, and they're shooting at his knees.  We'll be back after these words.  I'm being shot.  Angela.  Here's another example.  Tony talking about things we don't care about.  By the way, for those of you watching Friday, my daughter had her SAT Saturday.  And the feeling is, and a little update, the feeling is she felt really well about how 
[00:13:00]  it went.  Yay.  So I'm very happy about that.  Go, Katie.  And I hope all the other kids that took the test also did well, you know.  My daughter got laid for the first time.  It was a prom last night, and her legs were akimbo in the back of the limo.  She came home all stretched out with a little blood on a prom dress.  Yeah, so I'm very happy she's entered the world of sex.  It's great. 
[00:13:30]  What a tool.  He really is a boob.  My daughter passed his her essay, whatever that gender is.  I don't even know what it is.  A guy, a girl, I'm wacky.  It's nothing but uninteresting tidbits followed by hands hitting each other.  It stinks.  Drivel, I think they call it drivel.  I wish everybody else a little luck.  A little luck.  Wow, that was genuine.  Everything's good natured.  We hope everyone's life is fine and dandy. 
[00:14:00]  You got to smile early in the morning, you know.  Yeah, of course.  Laugh in the world, laugh with you.  I like the applause break.  The applause break makes me physically ill.  You know when you should get an applause break where you're like, so I was out with this  chick, and she wouldn't talk to me.  I poured something in her drink.  Next thing you know, she's passed out, and I'm banging her.  Now she gets the applause break.  I went to dinner with my daughters last night, and the waitress spilled my coffee, so I dumped 
[00:14:30]  the hot coffee on her tits.  It was amazing.  She screamed, and then I punched her in the face.  Where is that?  Damn it, I got so many freaking CDs here.  I love this guy.  Oh, it's just, what an ass.  It's so funny when you put it that way, Jim, that it's like a goof, like somebody put together  a goof of a talk show.  Well, this website is hilarious, so there's another section on the Tony Danza website where 
[00:15:00]  they just goofed the show.  He likes to say hearts, thoughts, and prayers.  Oh, this is his insincere shout-outs.  Pretty much every morning, he likes to say these hearts, thoughts, and prayers.  These are shout-outs to people that have had tragedy in their life.  Yes, and he wants those people to know that my hearts and prayers and thoughts are with  all these people, and it's so insincere because he says the same thing no matter what happened  to these people. 
[00:15:30]  They're dead, they're a hurricane, they're this, they're that, same line.  Well, Sex Bagel put a little montage together of all his hearts, thoughts, and prayers.  Yeah, this isn't a loop.  These are different times that he says the same thing.  I thought, I sort of, oh, sorry.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to step on the cue.  My thoughts and prayers are with Jim Norton.  Tripping on the words.  Tripping all over that one.  I really, I heard like a moment of this before, I really thought that they had looped the  same thing over.  I didn't realize these were different clips.  That's how awful he is.  I thought it was the same clip.  You can't even tell. 
[00:16:00]  Disingenuous idiot.  There it is.  Look, here in the USA today, the two big stories.  Ivan, this crazy hurricane.  Crazy.  This crazy.  Oh, it's crazy.  It's spinning all around and around.  I don't think it has any thought as to what it's doing.  It's wearing a goofy hat.  It's crazy.  It's wacky.  It was wearing clown makeup.  Right.  What a crazy hurricane.  Spinning around in his clown makeup, picking up boys, tying them up and strangling them in  Chicago. 
[00:16:30]  Crazy hurricane.  Look, here in the USA today, the two big stories.  Ivan, this crazy hurricane.  My gosh.  So our thoughts and our prayers and our hearts go out to everybody down in Pensacola and  Alabama.  I mean, yeah, Alabama and Louisiana.  And of course, Nebraska, the hurricane capital of the U.S., Nebraska, and Colorado, the Rocky  Mountains.  Here's a lot of hurricanes.  Any state that ends in A that has incest in it, just applaud for them.  Retard.  What is it, Alabama, Pensacola, and our own capital city of Saskatchewan is having problems 
[00:17:00]  with the hurricane.  It's a crazy zany hurricane.  Our hearts and our prayers go out to you, Jamie, and your family.  They were killed the other night, and so our thoughts and prayers go out to their family.  My heart, liver, and kidneys go out.  It's just over and over again.  Can we point out that the hearts and prayers should probably go out before the deaths you  ask?  Yeah.  It doesn't help once they're in a box. 
[00:17:30]  Not that you're dead.  My hearts, prayers, and a casket, okay?  Can we have our show sponsor a casket?  The Danzer casket?  We'll have it put on the side while he's planted.  Colleagues, before I get started, just on a serious note, you know, that hurricane, Ivan,  it hit Pensacola pretty hard.  So we're, you know, we send out our thoughts and our prayers to the people on the Coca-Cola.  The Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, 7-Up, all of them are devastated from the, what, Pepsi-Cola? 
[00:18:00]  Where was it?  You dolt.  I gotta go back now.  Hold on.  We're going backwards a little bit.  They're colleagues.  Before I get started, just on a serious note, you know, that hurricane, Ivan, it hit Pensacola  pretty hard.  So we're, you know, we send out our thoughts and our prayers to the people on the Gulf Coast,  especially in Pensacola, because it was really devastating.  And anyway, and also, we want to send our thoughts and our prayers out to Rodney Dangerfield.  You know, he's in a, he's in a coma, but he's supposed to be doing better, which I'm trying 
[00:18:30]  to figure out.  Yeah, he's in a coma, and that's great, everybody.  A hand for him.  That's great.  Coma.  A blood for a coma.  Because I've been in a coma for years, and they put, I'm doing a talk show, so apparently  it's not all that bad.  I think it's all the blows to the head when you were a fighter doing the golden gloves.  Oh.  But I think, you know, we, you know, our hearts and our prayers, and one other thing, another  hurricane for Florida.  And so our prayers and our thoughts go out to the Florida people.  He was always an inspiration, and we send our, our thoughts and prayers to his family 
[00:19:00]  and, and all his fans, because he was really one of the good guys.  I'm sorry about that.  These Florida people.  The last one was.  I just caught that to the Florida people.  The Florida people.  What an adult.  Another hurricane.  It's like these things, just, who keeps making them?  They're crazy.  They're crazy.  They just keep coming back with different names.  It is unbearably awful.  Let Hurricane Tony come in and sweep your mind away. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Huh?  You pasta-headed idiot.  Hurricane Tony just blows down syndrome all over the place, and you hear the sound of hand  clapping as you get dumber and dumber.  Here it comes.  Board up your windows.  And then there's a section on this website called The Real Tony Danza.  The Real Tony Danza.  This is a little hint of his actual personality show through.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pop out a little bit.  I want you to know something.  I think we should make one of each, a man and a woman, because I think the women are due 
[00:20:00]  to win tonight.  They're due.  I hope so.  Is the cameraman just going to keep talking, or should I, uh...  Ooh.  Um.  I know.  He's got a pick.  I'm losing the stage, folks.  A little uncomfortable laughter there.  He was serious.  Yeah, everybody.  I'm all good natured and stuff.  Hey, fucking asshole, shut up, or I'll punch your face in, all right?  My daughter, I had an A on her test. 
[00:20:30]  It's great.  If she didn't, I'd have hit the teacher in the twat.  I swear I'd have punched her right in the ovaries.  You know, another thing.  I'm on a roll.  Okay.  Keep it coming.  Keep it coming.  What else?  You want to talk about something?  Tell me.  Where are you going tonight?  What's the event?  Oh.  I don't care.  50 holidays?  No, I'm kidding.  That's how he feels.  He really is nasty.  You could tell.  You could tell what he's really like.  Let's see.  What else?  That's it?  I'm done?  You're telling me I have to move on?  I have to...  What?  Go ahead.  What?  No.  It's my show when it's live. 
[00:21:00]  Tough.  Oh, you know what he's probably like at home.  Awful.  Oh, man.  You spilled my coffee.  I'm feeling pretty good, I gotta tell you.  Oh.  So, I don't know.  It goes on and on.  Where's the closing song?  I was listening to that one last night.  What closing song?  You got that?  I never got that song on the show.  He sings a little tune.  Oh, this...  He sings a little tune at the end of the show.  Well, there's a whole category of Tony sings.  Ugh.  What the hell's going on out there? 
[00:21:30]  You hear that?  I don't know.  The cameraman's talking.  The cameraman's talking.  Hey, Elmo's back to sing Monster in the Mirror, and we have some of his friends.  Oh, no.  He's singing with Elmo.  He really is Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  So, you got that going for you.  Oh, my God.  No, he's scared.  Then I smiled at him and thanked him for the song that he had shared. 
[00:22:30]  The monster thanked me too.  He smiled right back and then.  The monster in the mirror sang his song again.  Yes.  He said,  Wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub.  Wub, wub, wub, wub, wub, wub.  I did it, I did it.  Oh.  Wub, wub, wub, wub, wub.  Turn it off.  Do not worry.  Wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba.  Wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba.  We'll be right back, folks. 
[00:23:00]  Wubba, wubba, wubba.  Wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba.  Wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba.  I would have more respect for that song  if it was called There's a Monster in My Rain.  That was horrendous.  There's a monster in my rain  and I'm sucking.  Wubba, wubba, wubba.  Wubba, wubba, wubba.  Wow.  There he is.  Here's another singing sample from Tony.  A little ditty.  Okay, let me explain what it is. 
[00:23:30]  See, I hosted the Miss America pageant,  but I'm bitter.  I'm bitter because I didn't get to sing the song.  So I was wondering if I could just...  Are you going to sing the song for me?  I just want to...  Oh, brother.  Because, you know, I don't mind hearing it again.  If I could just give you this  and if you'll take a walk down our red carpet  and I'll do it.  Wonderful.  Okay.  Yeah, there you go.  There she is.  There she is.  Miss America. 
[00:24:00]  There she is.  Your ideal.  With hundreds of beauties,  she'll take the town by storm.  With her all-American face and form.  And there she is.  Walking on air, she is.  Shut up.  You're almost hoping for the wrong song  to be queued up to watch  and do a little Irish dance  to walk off.  I had to hear some reflux.  Yeah, we'll get into the Ashley Simpson thing  in a little while. 
[00:24:30]  All right, well, you get the idea.  It's a pretty good website.  Can I tell you what bothers me about that?  Yeah.  It's this forced, manufactured charm.  It's like, look at how cute I can be  doing something I know I'm not too good at,  but I'm a freewheeling spirit, folks.  Look, I'm trying real hard.  Just good-naturedly having fun  and it's unbearably awful.  That's what America wants to watch on TV, though, bro.  That is true.  He gets ratings.  It's getting ratings  and it's getting great reviews.  All the hearts and prayers go out 
[00:25:00]  to people watching my show.  The Tony Danza link is now on  foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  So there you go.  Little Tony Danza.  For some reason, though,  we're fascinated by the program.  I can't stop talking about it.  Oh, we can't turn it off.  After the show,  after the show is over,  we sit in the studio  because our office is not done.  And so we sit in the studio here  and have a little after-show hangout, 
[00:25:30]  you know, talk a little bit.  How are we supposed to take this show  to the next level  if we don't have an office?  Right.  Well, there's two buckets,  one of things you can control,  and the rest with all your office supplies in there.  That meeting stunk.  Oh!  Are you criticizing our meeting  we had yesterday?  We had Eric Logan come into town  and give us a little pep talk.  Little pep talk.  Sat right here in the studio  because our office isn't done.  He really doesn't know  who he's dealing with.  He's giving us a little pep talk 
[00:26:00]  and using all this corporate lingo.  Anthony and I are looking at each other going,  uh, what?  Nothing against Eric,  but I nodded off twice.  I was scared I was going to snore.  And it's nothing against...  I mean, anyone could be in here.  Tony Danza could be in here  with all his thrill  and, okay, maybe I should pick someone else.  Well, the applause would wake you.  Right.  But I was...  Twice, I found myself  opening my eyes and going, 
[00:26:30]  oh my God, how long was I out?  Twice I did it.  And then I had to, like,  get up, lean forward,  and contribute something to the meeting.  Well, I had a lot of analogies.  The two-bucket thing.  A lot of corporate analogy talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, two buckets.  One of the things we can control.  One of the things we can't control.  Let's look at what we can do with this bucket.  It was the worst...  It sunk in on you, though, Jimmy.  You remember it.  Yeah, let's fill up the bucket  with the things we can control.  There are some things we can't control,  and those just have to be put aside.  Perhaps later they will go into the 
[00:27:00]  we-can-control-it bucket.  But right now they're in the bucket  of things we can't control.  There's this other bucket  that's empty over here,  and that's the things that we can control.  See, one bucket has  Jimmy's plummeting T-cell count in it.  Those are things we can't control.  And in the other one,  there's condoms and things  that he could have used.  Those are things we can control.  I don't care what bucket you use, Mr. Logan.  Just get me one.  I want to throw up.  That's the worst thing  I've ever heard in my life.  One bucket has snot  that a girl by Jimmy's bed 
[00:27:30]  has been puking up into it.  It was hilarious.  Oh, he just had all the corporate lingo.  And then the analogy he made...  I think we're just not used to people  caring about our show  and trying to bring us to the next level.  We're used to just being our own bosses.  So we just do what we do.  And I think he's trying to maybe...  Not control, but try to push us forward.  Contribute a little bit.  A little...  To his credit,  I think he just wants to try  to push us forward  with this radio show.  Help out.  Now that we're feeling  a little more comfortable,  we're starting to move  the show forward, right? 
[00:28:00]  He made an analogy  between the Yankees' Red Sox,  which every corporate guy does  in a meeting.  You always take the topical event  and spin it into an analogy  that you could use  to make your point.  And Jimmy was not buying this analogy.  I'm sitting here,  and that, I think,  is what woke me up, too,  is because Jimmy just was fighting  this analogy tooth and nail.  Because it was...  I forget exactly how he worded it,  but it was like he absolutely  made my point without meaning to.  Right.  He was talking about,  we were talking about, 
[00:28:30]  obviously, you know,  Sirius and XM,  and just, you know,  how you look at one.  He's like, well,  I mean, the Red Sox won this year  because they weren't thinking  about the Yankees.  They were just going out to win,  meaning we should worry about us.  And I said, no,  the Red Sox won  because all they thought about  was the Yankees,  and they built that team  to beat the Yankees.  That's why they got shilling.  And he's like, well, yeah,  but this is different  because we're kind of in midseason.  That was the worst reply.  And then I asked,  what happens if there's a rain delay?  And it completely screwed everyone up.  I started bringing a tarp out  onto the studio 
[00:29:00]  because I thought it was going to rain.  The ump made a lousy call,  and all of a sudden,  we don't have an office.  And we don't even have a porch  to run under.  And if we're going to go  with this baseball analogy,  how about you build our stadium  so we can play ball?  Right.  How about our,  where's our stadium?  We're stuck here in the dugout.  Right.  We don't even have a field  to play on.  We're still in the dugout.  Our office is a mess.  There's a security  chasing an oompa loompa  around the bases.  How did he get on the field?  Eric's sitting there 
[00:29:30]  with his bloody sock  trying to make things okay.  So it was a nice rah-rah speech,  and the first email I got  right after the meeting was,  oh, guys,  you will not have a production studio  for the rest of the week.  Yeah, thank you.  So there you go.  I thought we were,  that's going to help us  push the show forward.  I thought we were moving forward.  All of a sudden,  Eric comes in and says,  guys, we can't edit anything.  We can't produce anything  for the next four or five days.  And he said,  because the studio is down.  Yeah, the studio is down.  There's no office,  but we've got to move 
[00:30:00]  our game forward.  Okay.  Well, there's some good suggestions  about maybe for the election.  Just go on live.  That was a good one.  I like that one.  Jimmy just has to say this.  Why?  Yes, there was a suggestion made  that perhaps,  but I'm not sure  if this was a literal suggestion.  I believe it was just,  it showed the ability  that this program has  to go on for any event.  So he brought up one.  Yeah, let me just set it up  really fast,  because we run this channel,  this 202,  this high voltage  that we're still trying 
[00:30:30]  to change the name of.  It's all ours, toots.  Another thing that's  not going anywhere.  We want the channel  to be Opie and Anthony's Virus  or something that makes sense.  But anyway,  we run this channel, yes.  So he wants us  to start looking at opportunities  to just kind of pop on  at other times of the day  and do things.  For events.  Which we definitely want to do  when we feel more comfortable  with this radio show.  And they can also,  he said,  be opened up  to the general population  of subscribers on XM.  Right.  Instead of just  the premium subscribers, 
[00:31:00]  if we did some kind  of specialty program,  they could open it up  and give it out to everybody  and turn everyone on  to the Opie and Anthony show.  So one suggestion  that was made,  I think it was a random thing,  maybe off the top  of his head,  was that we do  an election coverage show  on election eve, Opie.  Next Tuesday.  Next Tuesday,  we come in here  at maybe 7 o'clock at night,  stay till midnight,  and do a whole rundown  of the election.  That suggestion 
[00:31:30]  made my back hurt.  First,  is anybody going to be,  look,  I know the election  is tonight or tomorrow morning,  let's just flip through  randomly and see  if the block  has been taken off  any channels  and anyone's doing  a particular program.  No one would hear it.  Three people would hear it,  and that's including us.  The election coverage.  I believe it would be better  if we did it  in front of a giant Pop-Tart.  Could you imagine?  Now,  why didn't he bring that up?  We could have a big map  with the election coverage  on the Pop-Tart. 
[00:32:00]  The blue states.  Oh,  could you imagine that?  Jimmy,  let's throw it over to you.  And maybe producer Ben  could tell me  he's not going  onto the election trail  so I could pull little pins  out of the map  as I cry.  Let's go to Ben  for what precincts  have checked in already  with the election results.  With 98% of the precincts  reporting in,  we can absolutely report  that George W. Bush  seems to be the winner.  Nice try,  Kerry!  That would be a great show. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah,  and we could just stay  until midnight  and do a whole wrap-up  of the election.  It would be like  that Mary Tyler Moore episode  when they have to stay  for election coverage  because the machine wrecked.  That was really good.  And Ted is there  talking to the priest  and he's talking to the janitor  until four in the morning.  You see,  there's a bucket of things  we can control.  Mary,  Murr,  dip into the bucket of things  we can control.  You know,  the Red Sox, 
[00:33:00]  one,  because they didn't  concentrate on the Yankees.  It's easy to grin  when your bucket comes in.  Spalding,  we're doing election coverage today.  And you got the election beat.  You'll vote for Kerry and Like It.  How about a Fresca?  Danny,  how many precincts  are reported in Danny?  You're no gentleman.  Hey,  I'm no candidate either, 
[00:33:30]  all right?  Oh,  that just...  Oh,  what a meeting.  What a meeting.  I did notice some blood  on my ankle  during the meeting.  My ankle spontaneously bled.  My tendon came out  of its sheath.  And speaking of buckets,  I hope you're slipping  one filled with  you-know-what.  Jesus.  He's our boss.  He's attempting  to be our first boss. 
[00:34:00]  Give him a shot.  I was old Sammy Snooze.  Oh,  you really were.  I was dozing  in the chair.  What a narcoleptic ass.  We just don't do well  with meetings.  Never have.  Never have.  A meeting would not have  classified as an extravidanza.  It's just awful.  But like I said again, 
[00:34:30]  it might sound like  I'm kissing ass,  but nothing against Eric.  I like the guy.  It's pretty much,  you know,  I remember being in meetings  with Ken Stevens  over there at Infinity.  Same thing.  I can't stay awake.  Not really.  During meetings.  Eric didn't have,  it's not the same meeting  because Eric didn't have  his bags packed  and yelling and screaming  how he's quitting.  That he was quitting on us.  He's quitting as our boss.  Poor Ken.  He should have quit.  He should have quit.  He should have quit on us.  He would have maybe  still had a career.  He would have got his  severance at least.  Instead of being out  on a little sailboat 
[00:35:00]  out there in D.C.  Whatever he's doing  these days,  poor guy.  We love him.  Eric,  take a close look  at where Ken Stevens  is right now  and just be careful.  All right.  It tends to happen.  So we're making  the show more gooder.  More gooder  by closing down  our production studio  for a week.  Right.  Why is it closed down  by the way  if I could ask?  Well,  they're upgrading.  Okay.  That seems like  something you should do  on a weekend  but they're,  you know,  they're upgrading  the facility.  Nah,  you better off  doing that  Tuesday through Friday  because you're not  going to need it.  Yes,  you are. 
[00:35:30]  You're better off  Tuesday or Friday.  Remember when I said  that all these cubicles  will be gone?  Yep.  Yeah.  I remember.  That's happening.  We win.  We won.  We're taking over  this whole facility.  We're going to have  the entire floor.  Yeah,  we won.  So all those cubicles  go room for pinball machines  and foosball tables.  Yes.  And Jägermeister machines.  Yeah,  a full bar,  a green room,  a lounge,  a recording area.  A little place  for bands to play.  Oh, yeah, man.  Master Poe checking IDs  as like chicks come in.  Master Poe very happy today. 
[00:36:00]  Oh,  he came in ecstatic.  Hey, guys,  he had a skip in his step.  Now,  I don't think he's allowed  to talk about it  on the radio, right?  I think when he came in  he was skipping  and as he's skipping  he kicked the lungs  out of a homeless guy  with one kick.  It was amazing.  Just left him dead  on the sidewalk.  Love that guy.  All right,  well,  kickboxing  with Master Poe today.  He's going to kick me  in the head  and do some  mental improvement. 
[00:36:30]  Look how happy  Master Poe is today.  Master Poe is so happy.  We're just acknowledging  that you were happy  you came in  jumping up and down.  He can't talk about it,  obviously,  but it's something  I went through also  a couple of years back  where I lost half my money,  but I was very happy  when it was over.  Right.  So,  Master Poe,  congratulations.  Thank you very much,  gentlemen.  You get how it has  to take three years?  Oh,  it has to  because the lawyer  has to make money,  Opie.  That's why it takes  three years.  We have to come in here  and take half of your money 
[00:37:00]  and give it to your  lovely bride  who contributed  to your marriage.  Oh,  really,  Dominic?  Is that what it is?  If it wasn't for her,  you wouldn't be funny.  Really,  Dominic?  Oh,  boy.  Is that what happened?  This is the only time  I get uncomfortable  on the show.  Is that what happened?  This is the only time.  I have worked out  Anthony's future income  earning potential,  and it is well within  $500 million.  God,  then we should be going  to serious. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah,  yeah.  If that's the case.  Really,  Dominic?  Because look at what  we're getting.  Nowhere's near that.  Could you maybe inform  the boss?  Right.  And there's my lawyer  trying to sell the fact  that we could blow up  at any time  and not make any money.  Hey,  if we're worth $500 million,  we'll support that  little doggy,  too.  What the hell?  Yeah,  there you go.  We have no loyalty.  For $500 million?  That company stinks.  That cutest little dog,  though.  I can't get over it.  There's another ad today  in Rolling Stone  where the guy's driving 
[00:38:00]  with the dog.  His little pal.  And that's supposed  to represent the radio  in the car.  If your spots  have gotten to the point  where you have  computer-generated  dogs in your car.  It's awful.  Driving around  like it's a character dog  that's supposed  to catch on  like Spuds McKenzie.  No,  it's simple.  There was AM.  There was FM.  Now there's XM.  See how easy it is?  You went the next day  I should have a cartoon  of a dog 
[00:38:30]  licking peanut butter  off the dick  of a skateboarder  with his own radio show.  Sucks.  First,  you have to balance yourself.  back after this.  They do have a skateboard show.  There's two buckets.  There's one with us  and one with a dog  that's being taken  into the gas chamber.  Wait till you hear  about the announcement  today that XM  is going to make.  Just proven once again  that this is certainly  the place to be.  Coming out with  a satellite bucket? 
[00:39:00]  Just wait.  Assume there's some  bucket announcement  coming out.  A bucket indeed.  When is that press conference?  That means we get to have  Eric Logan on the show  again today.  Again?  Can we get Eric Logan  on the show  about the big announcement  today?  Press conference is at 1.  1 o'clock.  We can't make an announcement?  It doesn't matter  if he's here.  We want him on the phone.  He's got all the knowledge.  We'll get him on  later on today.  Sure we will.  I'm sure he'll be  thrilled to death.  Maybe we can break  back in live,  do a little bit of  press conference coverage. 
[00:39:30]  Why not?  And then talk about  the election.  Just chat about it  a little bit.  See, I want to do  local election coverage  too.  You're a councilman,  you're a representative,  things like that.  He had the right idea  but the problem was  that instead of doing  election coverage  on election night,  we should just go  to a strip club  and turn on the channel.  Oh.  Or broadcast from a bar.  Erection coverage.  Broadcast from a bar.  I like that.  Broadcast from a bar  in Boston during  the World Series  and hope we don't  get shot.  Well, that's a good  one too.  Yeah.  That's the type of thing 
[00:40:00]  that our listeners  would like to hear.  I'm a huge Sox fan  though.  So that would be  a dream come true  for me.  Oh my God.  Ashley Simpson.  I can't get enough  of this video.  The Irish jig.  Oh, they keep showing  even though she  performed live last  night on the  Radio Music Awards.  And then you just  thought about yourself,  walked off stage  and made your band  sit there and eat it.  Oh, you're just  the best.  Look at these guys.  You're just the best.  All right.  Well, we'll give you  the Ashley Simpson  update, Anthony,  in just a few minutes  here.  We're going to take a  break.  Also, Grand Theft Auto  comes out today. 
[00:40:30]  Well, we can't get a  copy?  There was a guy on the  line that's been  playing the game for  10 hours already.  Working on it.  Working on it.  Okay.  I like the...  After work.  Probably after.  By the time we get  off the air, I'll  probably get it.  Grand Theft Auto,  San Andreas, which  takes place in  Huntington Station,  New York, Opie's  hometown.  Oh my God.  For some reason.  We'll talk about that  next as well.  I didn't know we  were living in South  Central, Los Angeles.  We'll get into that  next.  The little hamlet of  Huntington.  Trust me.  You know, we don't  have to tease any of 
[00:41:00]  this stuff because we  got you.  You paid your stupid  $2, so we're going to  take a break.  We got you.  $2.  This isn't like  regular radio where  we have to sell it to  you.  You got us.  We got you ready.  We got a lot of...  You're in the bucket.  We got a lot of great  things to do today,  though.  Like so much vomit.  You're in the bucket.  Get me a bucket.  I'm going to throw up.  A bucket full of  water-thin mints.  No, another bite.  I couldn't fit another  bite. 
[00:41:30]  That's great.  The bucket.  Which Monty Python  was that?  Was that Meaning of  Life?  Meaning of Life.  Okay.  Anthony, as we go to  break, the PSA that was  banned in Canada, we  kind of touched on it a  little bit.  Hey, I love this.  This is doing a lot of  good.  The videos are up on  opianthony.com.  They're spousal abuse  PSAs.  And funny as hell,  right?  I finally saw the video.  Oh, you saw the video.  Oh, my God.  Isn't it great?  The audio doesn't do  this just as not at all.  The coffee one, the  reaction of the guy, the  initial reaction of him 
[00:42:00]  in the coffee.  The smirking laugh that  he does.  She spilled my coffee.  I can't believe this  bitch just did this  reaction.  Makes me want to hold  this guy and put him  in every show that we  have in this country.  He should always be on  TV.  It looked like the guy  wasn't acting that much.  Dude, he was the  incredulous reaction.  Oh, I know.  She spilled my coffee.  She spilled my coffee.  He's laughing like,  you don't know what  you're going to get  now, do you?  It's that laugh right  before a balled up fist  comes crashing into  your gums.  I love it. 
[00:42:30]  No humor in that  laugh.  All right, so here's  one of the others.  Maybe for a split  second, even she went  like, yeah, thinking  he's, you know, good  natured about it.  She spilled my coffee.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Scalding coffee on the  tits.  Take that, you.  Well, here it is.  Here's the PSA that  was banned in Canada.  Calgary, I do believe.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  You wouldn't get away 
[00:43:00]  with it here.  You shouldn't get away  with it at home.  It's time to find America's  sexiest state.  Illinois is Illinois.  At that point, the thighs 
[00:43:30]  close down on your ears  and you feel like you're  diving at about 300 feet.  Hey, let's hear it for  Karen.  Illinois, once again,  sexiest state in America.  Defending their title. 
[00:44:00]  Thinking you can beat them?  Call O.B. and Anthony  at 866-WOW-1-WOW  and give it your best shot.  Got someone at the door?  Of course.  Okay.  Yeah.  You ordered a pizza?  Yeah.  Pepperoni, right?  No, not pepperoni.  That's what it said?  No, I didn't know.  I said a plain pizza.  Sir, I'm sorry, but I took  the order myself and I heard  it was your...  My wife's a vegetarian.  I can't have pepperoni.  Do you want the pizza or not?  You guys messed up the order,  not me.  Hold on.  No, you guys messed up. 
[00:44:30]  Let me check with my wife.  All right.  Just hold the phone for me  for a second.  Hello?  Yeah.  What's going on with this guy?  I don't know, man.  You sound like you're  best with his balls.  No, the guy ordered  a pepperoni pizza  and now he doesn't want  to pay me.  You know, I've gotten  stiffed three times this week.  This is a joke?  You're a pizza guy, man.  Take it easy.  But I'm saying the guy's  trying to stiff me out  of like 12 bucks.  I don't even know  you or him.  Well, but I'm just saying...  I don't care about your problem.  Well, I've got a problem here.  I need to solve.  I mean, I've got to get rid...  What the fuck 
[00:45:00]  you talking to me for?  I have no idea.  Look, I...  I don't know who this guy is.  I don't know who you are.  I just got to get rid  of this pie.  That's all I'm saying.  You sound like a fucking joke.  Do you want to...  Do you want the pie?  I'll get it to you.  Actually, pepperoni.  Um...  You like pepperoni?  Hold on one second.  You guys want pepperoni?  You guys will deliver  here to Broad Street?  Yeah, I can be there  in like 20 minutes.  You want the pie?  Yeah, well, let's see  what this guy wants.  Is he selling my pie?  He wanted to pie the guy.  This guy wants...  You don't even know  if I wanted her now.  You said... 
[00:45:30]  My wife, she's going to  take the pepperoni.  No, you said it didn't...  Sir, you're buying  a pizza off of him?  This guy is crazy.  I get a pizza at my house  and now you want the pizza?  He just said you were taking...  You didn't want the pizza.  No, I said I'm going to  go check.  My wife said she'll  take the pepperoni off.  This guy is making up  shit as he goes along.  I cannot...  I just heard him say,  okay, you'll take the pizza.  All right, I'll give it to you.  This guy is putting words  in my mouth.  I'm a freaking mortgage broker.  I don't want your pizza.  Well, why did...  He just said you...  I just came in.  I'll call you back later, okay?  No, don't call me back later.  Look, do you want the pizza?  Here.  You're selling him a pizza? 
[00:46:00]  Do you want the pizza?  Sir, do you want the pizza?  I don't want the pizza.  This is a joke.  This isn't a joke.  He doesn't want the pizza now either?  He don't want it.  He doesn't want the pizza now.  I'm stuck with a pie.  You don't want it either?  I don't want the pizza.  I never ordered...  What the hell is going on?  Well, I don't want it either.  Well, somebody's going to  have to pay for this.  I don't care.  That guy's got to pay for it.  Well, you get his address here.  Just get it out of here.  Then you've got to buy  the pizza, sir.  No, they don't want the pie.  Someone's got to buy this pie.  Now he's not taking it.  You've got to take it.  I don't want to trust him  to borrow money off of it.  He's going to buy my pizza. 
[00:46:30]  Can you answer that?  Can you get the fuck off the phone  and put this guy back on?  Are you taking the pie or not?  Why don't you shove it up your ass?  Look, I'm just trying to get rid of the pie.  I'm trying to make a living here, all right?  Give a shit about what you've got to do.  You don't even have to tip me.  If you just take it off my hands,  I'd appreciate it.  So what's going on in your throat, jerk?  Do you want to talk to...  Yeah, give me the phone.  All right, it's my phone.  Get out of here with the pizza.  You guys decide on who wants to buy the pie.  You think I want a pie?  I don't know.  I walked in.  That's what you said you needed.  It's getting cold.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:47:00]  Exactly.  I don't want to work with you.  I can't trust you  that you're going to steal my pie.  And I don't know what kind of loan  you're going to give me.  This is really...  Goodbye.  I don't know.  I just don't want to look stupid.  You know the ultimate in looking like an idiot?  It's when you walk into a spider web, right?  Because nobody else sees that spider web.  They just see you walking off in the distance  suddenly flipping out for no reason whatsoever. 
[00:47:30]  You're just walking along.  Everything's fine.  All of a sudden...  Did you see that guy?  He just snapped.  He was walking along.  He just went nuts.  You're that tree.  Look, he's still doing it.  I don't know what happened to him.  It's the same thing  when a little bee starts chasing you around.  Nobody sees the bee. 
[00:48:00]  They just see you, you know,  just kind of brushing.  People off in the distance.  Hey, is that guy waving to us?  Hey, how you doing?  No!  Oh!  I don't give a fuck about nobody in this motherfucker.  Let me show your ass up.  Radio for the Angry Golfer.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  Black Betty, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah, Black Betty, bam, bam, bam.  Black Betty out of town.  Bam, bam, bam, damn thing gone wild.  Bam, bam, bam.  She's always with it.  Bam, bam.  She's on Rock City.  Bam, bam.  Whoa, Black Betty.  Bam, bam.  Yeah, Black Betty.  Bam, bam.  Where's my potato?  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  We greatly appreciate it.  Grand Theft Auto came out today. 
[00:49:00]  We're coming out later today.  We don't have our copy yet.  We're in the damn game.  You'd think we'd get a copy.  Oh.  Oh.  In the game.  Ah, just a little cameo.  I know.  30 seconds.  We're, what, callers to a talk show in the game?  Yeah.  Someone wrote, I think I might have thrown it out already.  Shoot.  On the instant feedback.  Oh, no, I got it.  Adam from Rochester.  Okay, I might be going insane, but I could have effing swore.  I heard Opie's voice last night while I was playing GTA San Andreas. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, we did a couple of call-ins to, I guess, Laszlo's show on the game radio.  Yeah, one of the talk shows on the game.  We call in and get a little wacky.  They got to us pretty late, so they'd already done a lot of the soundtrack.  I want to get, like, involved with that.  Well, next time.  Love GTA.  Yeah, the next one?  Mm-hmm.  When's that coming out?  It'll be a couple of years.  I'm psyched.  I want to play this one. 
[00:50:00]  Well, we were going to-  Couldn't get it?  What happened, Ben?  We were going to set up a PlayStation 2 in the studio and have a game and, you know,  and you guys would have gotten to listen to us play video games today.  Great.  That would have been great radio.  Yeah, it would have been great radio.  We wouldn't have said anything.  Maybe Eric Logan stepped in and said, don't bring in the PlayStation 2 for the boys.  Don't bring it in.  Is there an election game that you could play?  Election coverage game?  Let's say hi to Memphis.  It's Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good. 
[00:50:30]  What's going on?  Well, first of all, I just want to say I was a big fan of you guys and I lived in Jersey  and I want to say it's so unbelievable to have that.  He was a big fan in Jersey.  Jersey.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, he's playing GTA for 10 hours straight.  But there's no Jersey in the game.  No, no, no.  Don't need it.  I was just trying to bring it around to the Jersey.  To the Jersey angle.  And then he would do more Springsteen and then everyone would laugh and laugh and laugh. 
[00:51:00]  Laugh and laugh.  And we all would just be laughing.  All right, Chris.  So how's the game?  I've just barely even gotten into it.  I've been playing it for like 10 hours straight.  10 hours, barely got into it.  Isn't the, I hear it's huge.  I'm looking at the map.  It's like, it's enormous.  It's unbelievable.  And just the area I'm in now is kind of like a Boys in the Hood kind of thing.  Yeah, that's the whole, the whole gist of the game is pretty much, you know how the last  one was Vice City and it was very 80s like with the 80s movie references and music. 
[00:51:30]  This one is pretty much early 90s.  Old school, West Coast rap.  Yeah.  And a lot of the, you know, Boys in the Hood, Menace to Society kind of, New Jack City kind  of feel to the whole thing.  Pretty cool.  A lot of drive-bys.  Yeah, you get to do like four-person drive-bys.  Oh, great.  Even right from the beginning.  I'm thoroughly addicted.  I'm going to be stuck in my couch for like the next six months. 
[00:52:00]  I can't believe it.  What's your weapon of choice?  Well, I haven't gotten into too many of the weapons right now, but basically a shovel.  Bashing homies on the head with a shovel?  There you go.  That's how you do it.  All I care about is the motorcycle jumps.  Have you found that yet?  Oh, those are great.  Stunt, insane stunt bonus.  You find any of the jumps?  We've gotten in a few of them.  Haven't found any insane stunt jump bonuses or anything like that, but I've started, they  have the same PCJ 600 and you get to roam around in that a lot. 
[00:52:30]  Nice.  Okay.  I got to play.  God.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right.  No problem, guys.  A lot of people playing GTA this morning.  It's Preston from South Carolina.  Go ahead, Preston.  Hey, I played the game.  It's awesome.  I'm Preston and I've played the game.  My name is Preston.  Yes, Preston.  You're enjoying the game?  Yeah.  I went to EB Games yesterday night and there was like a line.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  People waiting on line at midnight for the game.  That's it.  Yeah.  You know, I'm, I'm extreme, but wow.  No, I was sleeping.  What were they in line for?  Sinus medication?  Just for the Grand Theft Auto game.  What?  Just for the Grand Theft Auto game.  Are you missing part of your tongue?  I'm trying to figure this out.  South Carolina.  No, no.  No.  They, they, they speak fine in South Carolina.  I'm from Wisconsin, actually.  Oh.  Maybe he's eating some cheese. 
[00:53:30]  He's got a mouth full of cheese.  Yeah, I just woke up.  Oh, okay.  All right, that's your excuse?  Yeah.  All right.  I have to go to work.  So, do you like GTA?  Yeah.  I played the last one.  It was all right, but this one, it's a lot better.  What's your favorite part of the new game?  I haven't got totally into it, but I guess the drive-by.  Generoso.  Nice one.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  What's up?  I just want to say, that is one sick game.  We picked it up last night. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Me and my son, we were online for about an hour.  We had 300 people there, but that game, it just starts out with gang banging, and now  we are up to bashing crackheads over with baseball bats.  See, this is what we want in our video games, but you watch what happens with this game and  the stupid media.  They're going to go crazy on this one.  And the Walmart, I guarantee the Walmarts will try to ban the game.  It's already happening.  It's already happening?  Yep.  No surprise there, but this is what we want. 
[00:54:30]  Don't you want a game where you could bash a crackhead over the head with a baseball bat?  That's what you want in a game.  You can't do that in real life.  Well, you can if you're in Huntington Station.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My son went, bought it, and I'm kind of embarrassed, but she's 17 watching him play this game, too.  I'm like, you know, I don't know if this is good enough to teach a high school kid doing  this.  As long as they keep it and just doing it in the game, that's fine.  My five-year-old nephew.  It's healthy. 
[00:55:00]  My five-year-old nephew played Miami Vice with me.  There you go.  My sister wasn't too happy, but...  Shooting people's heads off.  Well, thank you, bro.  Running people over.  Well, my sister drops her kid over to my house from time to time, and, you know, I don't  have kid games in my house, and...  You have nothing in your house.  And after a while, you know, the kid's running around exploring, and there's nothing to do,  so...  Chase the rat.  Let's play Chase the rat.  And I know my sister's going to be another hour, so I'm like, oh, how am I going to, 
[00:55:30]  like, keep this kid, you know, interested here, so...  Fire up GTA.  All of a sudden, I see my PlayStation 2, and I have a few games, and I go, hey, hey, JD,  you want to play some Grand Theft Auto?  So, he's really good with the video games, all these kids.  I mean, they start really young now, man.  He could surf the internet, and he doesn't even know how to read yet, but he knows how to  get to his websites, you know?  That's it.  So, we put the game on, and I'm trying to be responsible, so I'm like, look, this is 
[00:56:00]  what you do.  You knock on the window, and you could take that guy's car over.  I don't...  I try not to say it.  It's carjacking.  Carjacking.  You know?  Yeah, but he pulls him out of the car.  I know.  So, he's playing that, and tooling around the streets, and the cars, and stuff.  But then, he discovers on his own that you could, you know, use weapons and stuff, and  that's all he wants to do.  So, you know, fast forward an hour later, my sister comes through the door, and JD is  just killing everybody.  Mowing down people.  Yeah, that's great.  Running people over with the car.  My sister's screaming. 
[00:56:30]  Good job, O.  Good job.  What the fuck are you doing?  Good job.  Well, I didn't have anything else that he could play with, so, you know, what are you going  to do?  All right.  You need a golfer dictionary?  Jay from New Jersey.  What's this?  Go ahead, Jay.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  I just got the game last night, and I don't understand what the hell's going on.  I was hoping you could send me a golfer dictionary so I could understand what they're saying.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's like most of the stuff you don't even understand. 
[00:57:00]  Even if you can understand what Ice Cube is saying, you just don't understand what the  hell they're talking about.  Well, if you don't understand what someone's saying, kill them.  That's pretty much all you have to do.  Those are the main characters, so you're not allowed to kill them.  I like just going through the game and having a dialogue with people.  I like chit-chatting with some of the residents.  Hey, listen.  I was sitting online last night waiting to get the game, and there's this crack addict  mom sitting in front of me with her two kids.  They had to be eight and ten, and they're talking about, I can't wait to go kill some 
[00:57:30]  motherfuckers.  There you go.  It was crazy.  My mom is featured in the game.  That's right, baby.  That's right.  All right.  Tom in Philly.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, guys.  Hey, O&A.  How you doing?  Real good today.  Hi, Tom.  Hey, boo-boo.  This is Frida.  Hey, you cunt.  Are you sick of the mud? 
[00:58:00]  All right, go ahead.  I was buying the game for my dickhead son, and let me tell you, Mike, is that a noose  around your neck?  All right.  Don't keep the joke going this long, sir.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Last night, I'm buying the game.  Mom's in there buying the games for their kids.  This is going to cause so many problems.  That's why they have ratings.  That's why there's M on there.  Blood and horror.  Intense violence.  Yeah, but the parents can buy it for kids.  I don't see a problem with the parents buying it for their kids if they feel like their 
[00:58:30]  kids can handle the game.  If they feel the kid is mature enough.  Yeah.  There you go.  Some kids can handle it, and some kids can't.  It's just a game.  It's as simple as it gets.  It's only a game.  My older sister has two kids that are literally brilliant, and these kids were brought up watching  R-rated movies and nudity on TV from the time they were five or six.  Well, remove them from the house.  Huh?  Watching that type of film with you?  No, no.  They live in Florida, so they were safe from my influences. 
[00:59:00]  The creepy Uncle Ope invites them over to rent the Emanuel series.  It all comes down to what your kid can handle.  It's as simple as that.  Some can, and some can't.  Yeah.  So, all right.  Thanks, bro.  Love you, Tom.  Game's going to make a fortune.  Let's say hi to Rob in Huntington Station.  This could be a nice radio sag.  Talk, everyone.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's going on, bro?  Not much.  Just getting off work in the midnight shift here in Huntington Station.  Where do you work?  Right now, Huntington Station here on Long Island. 
[00:59:30]  No, I know, but where?  Like, what do you do?  Oh, I'm a cop here.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, no.  We have a full-time experience every night with crackheads running around the streets here.  Huntington Station, Ope.  Yeah, these are the sounds of Huntington Station.  Huntington Station.  You've got to love it.  And stop saying that this is my town.  My town is Huntington.  Huntington.  Big difference.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Your town is Huntington.  And where all this is happening is where the train comes into Huntington.  It's called the other side of the tracks.  Exactly.  All right.  It's a big difference.  It's a little close, let's just say.  It's a little too close for my life.  Huntington was elected America's city, one of the top cities in all of America.  Hey, how about that?  Huntington, huh?  Elected America's city.  So you're a cop?  Yes, I am.  You guys cleaned up the gang violence over there, huh? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, cleaned it up.  They arrested some guys.  Some.  They arrested like 158 guys.  I read the paper.  I read the arrest reports and some of the gangs that they arrested.  It sounds like Grand Theft Auto.  It sounds like Grand Theft Auto took Huntington, and that's what they use.  They got everyone.  Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings.  They got that.  What's the other one?  MS-13.  What is MS-13?  It's a big Latin gang.  Wow. 
[01:01:00]  And then there's, what's the other one?  The Legion of Doom.  Legion of Doom?  What are they?  You got Latin Kings.  You got Southside Posse.  Southside Posse.  Old Station Soldiers.  What kind of guys are the Legion of Doom?  You got a little bit of everything.  Do they wear capes?  I'm the Legion of Doom.  You know, they run out with spikes on their shoulders.  It's just like animal and hawk.  Animal and hawk.  That's pretty scary when you look at that and think it's very suburban Long Island. 
[01:01:30]  It really is.  Yeah, we were out there last night.  We had canine helicopters overhead.  Now, how does a dog fly a helicopter?  Oh, canines and helicopters.  I thought you had canine helicopters.  Well, if you're the serious dog, you can do just about anything.  Oh, that's right.  He rides in the back of the car.  He talks.  That's right.  You can do anything but get good programming.  You hear about these canine helicopters.  They have like $550 million. 
[01:02:00]  So, Rob, what do you have for the show today?  Just call and check in and let you know I'm spreading the virus to all the cops here out in Suffolk.  Oh, cool.  Doing my radios to all the guys.  Hey, is this true?  The MS-13 formed an alliance with Al-Qaeda?  I've heard bits and pieces about that.  Yeah, right in Huntington.  That's great.  I don't know about Huntington, but down in Virginia, supposedly.  Oh, we have some inside info on the MS-13 gang? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, I read an article last month that actually the FBI was investigating that they have a gun running thing going through Mexico,  and they actually had a meeting with Al-Qaeda operatives.  Jesus.  I like that.  We get our hard-hitting news from the interns.  The FBI's on it.  Is this the same intern that said the Bengals beat the Broncos?  No, that's a different one.  All right.  This is a lad with a little beard and no mustache.  Oh, it's the new look.  I know.  All right.  All right, Rob, thank you.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Cool.  Rob, I actually wanted to ask him something else. 
[01:03:00]  I hear the Go-Go's beat Dallas also, which was kind of an upset.  I didn't like his news break, by the way.  Yeah, I was online, and I read that someone in Al-Qaeda once went through Mexico with a gun and a guy from...  Yeah, that didn't sound very...  I don't know.  It wasn't really backed up very well.  Not a very convincing link.  No.  If you want hard-hitting news, turn on CNN.  Or turn on us for our election night coverage.  Oh, that's good.  That's right.  Oh, and then maybe we could just jump on New Year's Eve and do a little New Year's Eve coverage. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, sure.  We'll play Auld Lang Syne and drink a little of the bubbly.  Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose.  The New Year's Eve show could work.  I would do that because we're in the city.  That could work.  Where else would you want to be?  We could have some fun with that.  A couple years ago, I remember we did Eddie Trunk.  You were on Eddie Trunk.  That's right.  And I came in with my girlfriend at the time.  I was a drunk buffoon on the rooftop of our building doing the countdown to New Year's Eve. 
[01:04:00]  Five, four, three.  Not realizing Eddie is on delay.  So my countdown was a little off.  Yeah, it was like 40 minutes late.  Oh, it was horrible.  You stink.  That was horrible.  They're done, packed up.  I'm like, Happy New Year!  It's 12.33.  Cheering.  12.33.  All right.  Well, what are we doing, Hope?  You're hitting a lot of buttons over there.  Yeah, what do you got there?  I'm queuing something up for us.  You got some goodness?  Well, the people are loving the two-bar tape, so we'll do a little of that in a minute here. 
[01:04:30]  He's there, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just finishing up with this Huntington Station gang thing.  Yeah.  You've driven down 110, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Frightening.  There's this road 110 that goes from the fine village of Huntington through Huntington Station,  and then you finally get to the mall there to do a little shopping.  And it's really, really frightening.  Lock them up.  Don't stop for red lights.  Yeah.  It got to the point where you don't stop for red lights.  You're 100% right.  And these gangbangers will walk right in front of your car, right? 
[01:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  And they'll just saunter.  The slow walk.  They don't care.  The slow walk.  They'll walk right out in front of you when you're moving, not even at the lights or anything.  And they'll look at you like, yeah, I dare you to beep your horn.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I dare you to roll down that window and say something, and it just shows what kind of pussies we are.  Because if the same thing was happening with, like, a business guy or a lady with a stroller,  what would you be doing?  Yelling and screaming and beeping the horn?  You bitch.  But you always size.  She spilled my coffee in front of the car.  She's walking in front of the car. 
[01:05:30]  You know, but you always size up the person before you let them have it.  Of course.  Like, Master Poe comes walking in here.  He goes, guys, I really appreciate that you didn't really go after me on the air about my divorce thing.  And it took three years.  And I'm like, dude, you're an assigned killer.  We're not going to mess with you.  We're not stupid.  His hands are lethal weapons.  Yeah, you size up the competition, and then you decide if you could take them, and then you go and react, right?  No, when they're crossing the street, you stop.  You don't make eye contact and drive right by.  You look like you're fucking with the radio a little bit. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's that station again that black people can't look at me in the eye right now?  I'm just going to.  Yeah, because you also want to feel that you're still a man, so you may believe that it's not bothering you.  They're like, oh, no, I'm too busy with this cell phone call anyway.  You take your time.  If the choice is be a man or have your car look like Sonny's at the toll booth, I think I could pussy out a little bit and let him walk by.  The guy with a Glock is trying to make eye contact, and you're humming Brenda and Eddie.  Just hoping it goes away.  But if a soccer mom cuts you off on the road, what are you doing? 
[01:06:30]  There goes my chair again.  Whoa, you're right there.  And the chair keeps falling, you all right?  My foot keeps hitting the lever on the chair that makes it sink.  Attaboy.  Like an elevator.  You look like that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High at the restaurant.  At the restaurant.  Two Cokes, please.  Yeah, you were so low.  Hey, Rad, how you doing?  You come to this place?  I love it.  I come for the strudel.  I found your wallet. 
[01:07:00]  I love that movie.  But if a soccer mom cuts you off, then what are you doing now?  Honking the horn.  Hey, you bitch.  Screaming and yelling.  I'll kick your ass.  Yeah, you'll follow her for five miles.  Yeah.  Try to knock that minivan over a curb into the Passaic River.  Right?  Wow.  Wow.  Ouch.  Good callback.  There it is.  Yeah, they all drowned.  You know, our hearts, thoughts, and prayers live in my big toe out to the families.  Out to the families.  Oh, we got a correction coming in from... 
[01:07:30]  That reminds me, though.  My daughter got a gold medal in swimming.  You know, so I don't care about those dead people.  We got a correction coming in from Huntington.  It's Joey.  Joey.  What's up, Joey?  What's up, buddy?  How do you do, Joe?  Joey, are we being corrected about something?  Yes, yes.  Yes, the Beirut, the mini Beirut is south of the tracks and Huntington is north of the tracks.  Come on, Opie, you should know this.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Did I...  But I didn't say north or south, did I?  No, but the Beirut is south of the tracks.  That's where you got... 
[01:08:00]  You can't...  Yeah.  No eye contact, no nothing.  It's the wrong side of the tracks is south.  That's what I said on the other side of the tracks.  I said there's Huntington Village, and then the other side of the tracks is Huntington Station.  I used to go to the...  What they call the Big H Shopping Center that was up there.  And I used to...  There was a movie theater there, and I believe I saw Jaws there when it first came out.  I was a little tot.  Went to the movies.  A little tot.  It was fun, you know?  Back then in the olden days.  Now, that's a whole strip mall that is just boarded up, gang violence, drugs being sold. 
[01:08:30]  It's tragic, Opie, what has happened to our little hamlet of Huntington.  Our little hometown.  That's right.  Huntington stinks.  Opie, I don't even know why you go out there.  It's awful.  Because he lives there?  Stop living out there.  I don't know why you go out there with that...  Oh, you're with your house and driveway.  You know, oh, you need a bedroom.  That's where he keeps his tables and his parties mixed.  I got family out there, so I split my time. 
[01:09:00]  City during the week, and I try to go home on the weekend and say hi to everybody.  I like it.  All right.  And I take the Escalade out to the Hampton,  where I hang out with Billy Joel.  Sarah.  His young wife.  Ooh, that piece of ass.  What I like.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Sarah, what's up?  Sarah.  How are you?  Good.  What's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  Remember last week you were talking about your cousin?  My cousin?  Yeah, and he invented something to smoke pot in a dorm room.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My cousin, Patrick. 
[01:09:30]  He did not invent it.  Well, I didn't say...  He has all sorts of inventions.  You did say he invented it.  He was doing it.  Oh.  No, you did say that, but in 90...  Are you trying to say my cousin's a fraud?  No.  All right.  But in 92, we were at college, and we were using...  Can I say it?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sure.  Is it a toilet paper roll stuffed with fabric softener sheets?  Yep.  Well, yeah, that's one way to prevent people from knowing you're smoking pot.  Ope's cousin invented toilet paper. 
[01:10:00]  That's right.  And you might know his cousin, Tony.  He invented the applause break.  All right, Sarah.  Thank you.  One more.  We go to Fort Wayne, Indiana.  God damn.  Grant, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  It is so great to talk to you guys again.  I moved away from New York years ago, and XM came along, and guess what?  What?  I'm coming to you now.  What?  They're the stunner.  Yeah.  Anyway.  That thing's in Fort Wayne.  Yeah, well, the fact that I've been up all night playing Texas Hold'em with my boys, 
[01:10:30]  so I'm a little loaded.  There you go.  Very good.  How you doing?  You winning?  Oh, no.  I lost about 30 bucks.  Yeah.  Well, that's how it goes.  But, you know, I lived in Long Island for two years in the late 90s, and we used to race  up there to up 110 all the time into Huntington.  A couple of my friends live up there, and all this gangbanging stuff, this is news to me.  Yeah, you used to actually be able to drive down Route 110 and not have to worry that bullets  are going to fly through your windows.  They had 59, I think, or 58 shootings in the past year in Huntington. 
[01:11:00]  And you'd be surprised.  You know, if you think of a big city.  Huntington Station.  Huntington Station.  Okay.  Look at Ovi, he's still trying to salvage some kind of dignity for where he lives.  It really is a war zone.  You've got to leave, because it's creeping.  It's creeping that way.  The only good part is going to be right by the water.  I do have to admit that there's a lot more golfers walking around Huntington Village.  Yep.  There you go.  We were out shooting all day today at the shooting range. 
[01:11:30]  They're going to push everyone's back to the water.  The white people's back is going to be to the water like Dunkirk.  It's going to be awful.  You're going to have to swim to Connecticut.  Riff!  Riffs!  They killed Cyrus!  I like doing things like that.  All right.  Well, at 60 cents, the what?  We're sorry, warriors.  You don't even see her face.  She has those black, red lips. 
[01:12:00]  Get home safe now, warriors.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  What are you going to do to be out there?  Are you going to join a little gang?  No, they're cleaning up the gang.  Oh, a little gang.  Yeah, they're cleaning it up.  The blonde lads.  You can wear your cap sideways a little bit.  We don't have many Wiggers in our town, actually.  No.  What?  In Huntington?  We don't have a lot of...  The village of Huntington?  We don't have a lot of the Wiggers.  You've tried to be, but it just doesn't work. 
[01:12:30]  I have never tried to be a Wigger.  You have with cheddar.  Well, I like to talk the language from time to time.  Hope he runs around with his gang.  His stymie and Petey.  The dog.  I'll get you.  Wee.  Wah.  Wee.  Wah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Weezer's been shot.  We...  Wah.  We got a lot of stuff to get to. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, maybe we should start doing a radio show today.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah, we'll see.  Oh, let me check that off.  We did the Grand Theft Auto.  I thought that was very well.  So far, so good.  I can't believe we can't get a copy of this goddamn game.  I'm reading from people who are playing.  Why don't we have the game?  Ben, what is the problem?  Ben, get on it.  You're the producer, produce.  The problem is they wouldn't give me the game.  They were supposed to give it to me yesterday.  How did they not give you the game?  I was supposed to go to their office.  They wouldn't let me go to their office.  I know you're in it.  Featured stars on the game.  I talked to Laszlo about it.  Laszlo was supposed to come on our show today. 
[01:13:30]  Laszlo's not allowed to for two weeks.  Why can't Laszlo?  There's a lot of controversy that's going along with this game.  The company is very, very self-conscious of the fact that it's going to be banned.  Even Laszlo was saying, he goes, look, this game is done.  He goes, it's going to come out and it's going to be pulled from shelves.  It's going to be parent groups and politicians.  I just read an instant feedback that there's more cursing.  Here it is from Cage at Wackbag.  Awesome game. 
[01:14:00]  There's more cursing in the first five minutes of the game than on premium XM radio.  A lot of cursing.  But it's for adults, isn't it?  Yeah, but it's not one of those things that kids can't get their hands on.  I know, I know.  And you know something?  It doesn't matter if it's for adults.  To them, to these parent groups and stuff, it doesn't matter.  They don't want adults playing either.  It's too violent as I inhale spit.  What the hell was that?  What an idiot.  I'm talking, I'm hacking. 
[01:14:30]  You tried to use the cough button.  You failed miserably.  I know you just pushed the tinfoil on it.  I know.  I don't know what I'm doing.  It really bothers me that you go for the cough button.  I go for the cough button so I'm not hacking online.  I'll be on a professional broadcaster.  You want to be a polished broadcaster.  I'm looking to be on the Radio Music Awards next year.  Like I see some of the jocks.  Hey, how you doing?  We'll do that next.  Great.  Are we ready to take a break?  Because I really need to take a leak.  I'd like to get some coffee if we could swing that.  Spilled my coffee. 
[01:15:00]  Spilled my coffee.  All right.  Is he Jimmy pinning down an intern just pouring hot java over his chest?  Yeah, they're kissing him and making it better.  It's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.  Monster coffee getting all over you.  All right.  Here we go.  What?  Some teases for everybody.  Oh.  Flu shots.  We're going to get some.  TV.  Kid toucher.  Oh.  Ant makes $6,000.  Hey.  And I made six G's last night. 
[01:15:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Hold on.  These are teases.  Oh, I'm just teasing the fact that I made six G's last night.  All right.  I'm intrigued.  And gay guy with AIDS coming through.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to discuss that because I got a little side story about something like that.  All next on the Opiate Anthony program.  But first, we go back to the two-bar tape, Anthony.  The old F that runs this bar in Jersey City.  This is an old tape, obviously.  And these pranksters just gave this guy hell.  Ratskellions. 
[01:16:00]  We've been featuring this off and on for the last few days because it's unedited.  Unedited.  Uncensored, actually.  I heard this guy, he passed away.  Didn't he die?  This guy passed away.  Yeah.  Hearts and prayers go out to the two-bar guy.  Hearts, prayers, larynx, spleen.  Here we go.  I'm coming down.  Yeah?  Hello, is Phil there?  Phil is not working today.  No, Phil.  I'm supposed to. 
[01:16:30]  I'm supposed to get a call from Phil.  His last name is Lacio.  Who's this?  It's Bob.  Marino.  Well, Phil doesn't work today.  No, not the one that works, dude.  Not a Phil.  What's his name?  Lacio.  Phil, Lucio.  Phil, Lucio.  Phil, Lucio.  Phil.  No, he's not here. 
[01:17:00]  What?  He's not here.  How about Connie?  Is Connie there?  Connie who?  Connie.  Connie.  A girl, Connie.  No, a girl can come in this bar.  We have no good room here.  What number did you want?  This is the two bar.  Yeah, but there's no women in here.  Who is this?  No women come in here.  I'm sorry.  The two bar.  It is the two bar, but no women come in here.  You know who's this, Red?  Yeah.  I thought I'd suck at my prick.  Eh?  Suck, suck my prick. 
[01:17:30]  Why don't you come over?  I'll suck your pricks.  Eh?  Why don't you come over, you son of a bitch, you motherfucker?  Why don't you go out and fuck your mother, you cocksucker?  Come on over here.  Come on over, talk to me, you person to person.  I don't.  Why don't you come over, you fucking bum?  You're too yellow.  I'll cut your balls off.  It's the ONA FU line.  Call 1-866-FU-LINE-1 and tell that special someone.  Fuck you. 
[01:18:00]  A flower shop?  Yeah, hello?  Is this a flower shop?  It is.  Yeah, this is Spoonie Love from up above.  I want to send some flowers to somebody.  Two dozen red roses.  And on the card that we're going to attach to the roses, what would you like?  Oh, I got the cards and all that.  Okay, let me see what I want.  Now it's the small card, you know, that little enclosure card.  You might have to put two in there because I got some things I want to say to her.  Okay, what would you like? 
[01:18:30]  Yo, baby, I love you.  Okay.  I love you more than you know.  Okay.  But you did me wrong.  Give one dude a BJ, shame on you.  Okay.  Give two dudes a BJ, shame on me.  Okay.  If you think I can't get to you, you're wrong.  Uh-huh.  You ain't nothing but a stupid hoe. 
[01:19:00]  You've always been a stupid hoe, and you will always be a hoe.  Got that?  Uh-huh.  Love always your teddy bear.  Spoonie.  S-P-O-O-N-Y.  Yeah.  Could you read that back to me, please?  Oh, I got it right.  Could you read it?  I know, but I just want to make sure.  Could you read it back to me?  Oh, no.  Could you read that back to me, please?  Let me see if I can even write this.  You might have to come in and write it.  Okay.  But what was wrong? 
[01:19:30]  The hoe message?  The hoe or the hoe?  The hoe message?  Yeah.  When I call it a hoe and stuff?  Yeah.  Could we change the word hoe, then?  You know another word for hoe?  No.  All of you.  Do you know another word for hoe that we could use?  We can't put sexual messages on there.  How is sexual?  What would you say?  I mean, what would you suggest?  I would just say, I'm sorry.  She gave two of my cousins BJs on Thanksgiving Day.  I just went and put a car. 
[01:20:00]  Right on Thanksgiving Day at my mother's house.  She gave them both BJs and I was in the closet.  Because I didn't believe it.  I love my woman.  You know what I'm saying?  I loved her, you know?  But we can put...  And I saw it for myself.  She was doing both of them at the same time.  On her knees.  Gagging and everything, yo.  I can put...  I love you.  Could we change BJs to smoking a sausage or something?  Blowing the pole?  I can't do anything like that.  What do you call a BJ?  I couldn't... 
[01:20:30]  We can't do that.  We just can't do that.  Have you ever took part in that?  Have you ever been a part of that?  You've never given no one a BJ?  No.  No.  What?  I just can't do that.  I call her on Thanksgiving.  Please, please, please.  Could you just read it back?  I can't talk to you no more.  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202. 
[01:21:00]  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  The very worst of the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  Hey, this is Chaka the Chaka.  And as you do my fucking job for making me run air freight on the weekend all night long  without sleep when I'm supposed to have weekends off and have home time. 
[01:21:30]  I want to give a big fuck you to that first fucking show you guys did.  I took the day off to hear it and you guys have fucking nothing.  So fuck you to that first show.  I want to give a big F.U. to Howard Stern.  At least now there's something else to listen to in the morning.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE1.  866-FU-LINE1.  Fuck you. 
[01:22:00]  Woo, woo, woo.  Yo, check it out, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Music to fondle children by right there.  It's the Kid Toucher song.  Yeah.  What song isn't?  You know, we could seg into this really fast then.  Yeah.  We were going to save this for the hot teen news segment of the program.  You know what's funny?  The old show, the old O.P. and Anthony Show, we would run bits into the ground. 
[01:22:30]  And this new show, we're really trying not to.  We're trying to, like, spread it around a little bit and not spend as much time on things.  And we wanted to rest the whole hot teen news thing that we've been doing for the last couple weeks.  Give it a little breather, sure.  But, man, ever since we started this new bit, the hot teen news, every day in the paper there's a story about some teenager getting abused by either a weatherman, a teacher, someone on the Internet.  It's just every day. 
[01:23:00]  It's an epidemic.  We could do a half hour every day on teen stories.  But this one we can't let pass.  TV meteorologist accused of soliciting sex with minor.  Ouch.  This guy obviously doesn't have XM satellite radio.  Nope.  If he did, he would have heard us say that if you're ever online with underage people that you're trying to set up for a sexual encounter, it's always a cop.  Always a cop.  It's always a cop.  Always a cop.  Not that we're trying to save them, because, you know, they're despicable and they should be incarcerated. 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  But, man, they're stupid.  So, this guy's a weatherman.  Look at the smile he has.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey.  Let me tell you, he's quite an attractive weatherman, don't you think?  Oh.  What do you think?  Oh.  All he needs is a pink scarf around his neck like I used to wear on Match Game.  Oh.  Charles Nelson Riley.  Charles Nelson Riley.  Oh. 
[01:24:00]  Dude, man, we're trying to make people think we're young still.  What the hell?  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I'll say cock.  Oh.  I just wanted to howl.  She sucked his blank.  Wow.  That show was awful.  Match Game.  All right.  This happened in Miami.  South Florida TV meteorologist Bill Camel.  Bill Camel with you.  Hey, let's go to the weather with Bill Camel.  Bill, how you doing?  Uh, he was arrested.  I'm touching boys.  He was arrested Sunday in Fort Pierce as part of an investigation into sexual predators. 
[01:24:30]  Jim, what's wrong?  I'm just getting some, uh...  Nose spray.  Yeah.  Nose spray.  I don't want to hear...  No, no, no.  The nose spray that you were trying to get off of about a month ago.  No, no, no.  Isn't this great?  You could look at this story.  Yeah.  And it's like any other one of these stories.  And you never, ever want to be part of one of these.  Because you just look.  You see the name?  Mm-hmm.  Bill Camel.  Yeah.  The word sex?  Yeah.  14-year-old boy.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  That pretty much sums it up.  You cannot make a mistake now as to what this article is about.  You absolutely know what this is about.  Well, authorities say Camel set up a meeting for sex over the internet.  Of course.  With what he thought was a 14-year-old boy.  Ho-ho.  Hey-hey.  He thought it was.  I got some PlayStation 2 games.  Ho-ho.  Hey-hey.  Let me tell you something.  Grand Theft Auto just came out.  Want to play?  Ho-ho.  The boy was actually an undercover federal agent, police say. 
[01:25:30]  He's pretty young to be a cop.  A fed 14-year-old boy cop.  Hot.  He's an overachiever.  A badge and a gun and smooth abs.  Investigators said that Camel had arranged to meet the boy at a convenience store.  That's convenient.  The county sheriff's office said Camel had two condoms when he was arrested, as well  as two toys, one of which was a water gun.  What a creep.  Hey, he's going to play with the boy a little bit.  Funny.  Hey, why don't you get in the van? 
[01:26:00]  That's right.  I got some PlayStations for you.  And this Camel guy was an overachiever.  Two condoms.  Look at him.  Condoms.  What a fuddy-duddy.  I know.  This kid's 14.  What could he possibly have?  Just ravage that young backside and get on with it.  And get back to the weather.  Get back.  Get back to your satellite photo.  So, how was it?  Well, he was 14, going down to 12.  Now, back to you for the entertainment report.  Oh, that is hilarious. 
[01:26:30]  Well, it's partially cloudy with a chance of a conviction.  It might have been funny if I said partly cloudy.  Ah, we got it.  And not partially cloudy.  Ah, we got it.  WSVN representative said the station has fired Camel because they had no choice.  Do you think he thought for a second, I wonder if I'll still have my job?  The station issued a brief statement saying, we have no other alternative but to dismiss  Bill Camel for cause.  Of course.  He was the chief meteorologist over there.  Investigators said that Camel waived his right and admitted to having child pornography on his computer. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, what are you doing?  Hey!  The old Gary Glitter conviction.  Well, you know what the problem, the reason they fired him was because they were afraid  the other news people would start throwing subtle jabs that would affect the broadcast.  Like, well, that's the news.  Let's see what the weather is, baby raper.  All right, so he could face up to three years in prison for the charge, and he is facing 
[01:27:30]  additional federal charges that will be announced Tuesday.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  This guy is done.  He will be doing the weather from a jail cell.  Wow.  Huh?  I wonder if he'll end up in Kentucky.  Hey, with Mark.  That's right.  These guys never learn, though.  Oofy, 14-year-old boy, they think they're going to...  What a disappointment that must be.  Stop talking to kids on the Internet.  What a disappointment that must be. 
[01:28:00]  You're all worked up.  Yeah, clear stuff coming out.  Oh, you're just thinking you're going to get that 14-year-old boy.  You've got the water gun at your side.  He's got his condoms.  He's climbing the whole thing.  He's all excited.  He pulls up and...  Goes to the convenience store, probably craning his neck as he drives up.  Hey, where is that fine young lad?  Where's that little fella?  Where is that little minx?  Where's that little fella that understands?  I know he's here somewhere.  He...  What?  What?  Wait a minute. 
[01:28:30]  What?  What?  I...  I...  I...  Officer, where's the...  Have you seen a young boy around here?  What an idiot.  But it's good he wasn't conspicuous, you know, because a lot of people carry water guns and  condoms, you idiot.  Sure.  The kit of the child molester.  God.  That was a gag.  What a gag.  A gag for his forecast.  Go on, take the water gun, squirt it at his head.  It's going to rain today.  Ha ha.  No?  Then he put the condom on.  Don't I feel like a dick?  Ha ha.  Make sure you wear your rubbers. 
[01:29:00]  Ha ha.  Because it's going to rain.  And then he fires off the water gun.  That's probably what his lawyer's going to say.  Oh.  He was a crazy guy.  What a crazy weatherman.  Ha ha ha.  I'll bet you they said, I'll bet you that the FBI sent some pictures of some smooth youngster.  Like a nine and a half.  Oh, probably.  Some Joaquin Phoenix looking boy.  Jesus.  Ha ha ha.  Not a hair to be found.  Oh, no.  Maybe a blonde wispy one under the belly button.  And there he goes, pulling up to the convenience store.  Busted. 
[01:29:30]  Trail to heaven.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Oh, that stinks.  Another teen store.  Florida weatherman.  All those hurricanes got to him.  They never learn.  Mm-hmm.  Come on, kid.  Lay back.  Let's just pretend I'm Ivan, and I'll blow through your little town.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  God.  Oh.  Oh, sicko.  All right.  We have an Ashley Simpson update.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  They had the 2004 Radio Music Awards last night, Anthony.  And thank God they did, Opie.  You know, they invite us to this thing here and there, and we've always said, uh, no, thank 
[01:30:00]  you.  It looks really boring, and watching it on TV, oh.  But I think they roped me in anyway.  And I got to say, I'm starting to think conspiracy.  What do you mean?  Conspiracy.  What do you mean?  Yeah, he's ripping me off, because it's conspiracy against me, Robin.  I'm thinking the SNL thing was a ruse to get people to tune into this stupid thing that 
[01:30:30]  never gets good ratings.  She's putting a lot on the line, though, man.  You think?  People don't appreciate the Milli Vanillis of the world.  I disagree.  To me, I think that's going to eventually be a career ruiner for her.  Yeah.  I think she's going to survive it temporarily, but I think it's going to wreck her, because  it's like, that's a bad, humiliating...  Really is bad.  These publicists are getting clever, as far as getting attention for their clients.  But she's getting a lot of press, and they're spinning it, like, you know, all kinds of  ways.  Oh, now the latest one.  Her father came out and said she had... 
[01:31:00]  What was it?  Yeah.  Acid reflux.  Acid reflux.  Her father said Monday his 19-year-old daughter used the extra help because acid reflux disease  had made her voice harsh.  You know all that acid pumping around in her stomach?  Rotten little, non-eating, nervous, untalented stomach.  Doesn't that also make your ass raw?  Of course it does.  If you have a lot of acid reflux, it's because of the acid in your stomach, and that stuff  goes down into your intestines, and it just churns out what you wind up getting is what 
[01:31:30]  they call the salad shooter, which is just like, forget it, leaves it all over the place.  You wonder how it could, you know, up your back, it looks like you ran through a mud puddle  on your bicycle without a rear fender.  You ever do that?  And you get the big strip up the back of your hair.  Like, how does it get up?  Oh, no.  It's up the back of the toilet, under the rim. 
[01:32:00]  Sometimes you lift it up to take a leak, you're like, how did it get there?  How the hell did it get there?  That's funny.  What is that?  She's a douche for just walking off that stage and leaving her band there.  Left her, hung her band out to dry, blamed it on the band.  Just showing it's all about her.  I bet her crack is always sore from being in the toilet so much.  She can't sit too long, or she gets what's called cranky ass, where it's just all...  Swamp ass.  Swamp ass. 
[01:32:30]  You ever get that, though, when you sweat and it's raw and sore from being wiped so much  and it feels like you have, like, a sour cream and onion potato chip in there?  Oh, that was nasty.  Well, she's salty and sore.  She's pretty much blaming the fact that she used a vocal track at SNL on acid reflux.  It was a little acid reflux.  She must have been all nervous and Nellie, just feeling like she's got a take on just percolating.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  She came out in the press.  Sounds like a hinge.  Like an old rusty hinge in your stomach.  You're just laying there and it's like...  Mixed predator sounds.  Got a Wookiee in your belly.  Ah, that feels good for two seconds and then it kicks up again. 
[01:33:30]  The old dirigible gut.  She's percolating.  Percolating.  Oh, so she's blaming it on the acid reflux.  Quiet hot farts in the dressing room.  Oh, there's people in there primping her. 
[01:34:00]  You know it.  The hot air.  The hot air farts.  Sorry.  Oh.  Sorry.  Yeah, no, my hair.  I want it in front of my face a little more.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.  That was my band.  Awful.  That awful little jig.  Blaming it on her little tummy.  She blamed it on her tummy. 
[01:34:30]  She blamed it on her band.  Yeah.  And she came out in the press basically saying that she would never lip sync.  No.  She was so graceless handling this whole thing.  That's to me what's going to really hurt her.  She was such a graceless pig handling this whole thing.  Well, it just shows she probably was brought up like a spoiled brat.  I saw her lip syncing because at one point I saw her butthole open and close and then I heard...  It didn't even line up.  She was ass syncing.  Sphincter syncing. 
[01:35:00]  Sorry, guys.  Green cloud in the dressing room.  Oh, just a toxic cloud.  Rotten smoke detectors going off.  Little acid reflux farts.  Rotten eggs.  Old catalytic converter butt.  Just stinks.  Stinks like an old Buick LeSabre.  Oh, guys.  Trying to be cute but everyone's just disgusted.  Oh. 
[01:35:30]  Oh.  Sour log farts.  Oh.  So, anyway, we got some clips from the 2004...  That thong of hudders looks like Augusta Gloop's mouth.  Augustus Gloop, you dumb shit.  I got it, though.  That's funny.  I want to tell that joke in Augustus, Georgia.  Shut up.  I stink.  I stink like Ashley Simpson.  Ashley Simpson.  Oh, guys. 
[01:36:00]  I apologize.  Oh, she is awful.  She's god-awful.  So, we got the clips from the 2004 Radio Music Awards.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, they get a lot of DJs together to present all sorts of awards.  Yeah, this is their night to shine, Opie.  The DJ.  They haven't asked us in a while because we've been...  Out of work.  Out of work.  Off the radio.  But it's just a gig.  A scourge to the industry, an embarrassment to all of radio. 
[01:36:30]  Is that why?  Maybe.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think we're in the club anymore.  No.  Fuck.  Looks like Augusta Gloop's mouth.  What the hell was that?  I'm tearing up.  Augusta Gloop.  I was so eager to get it out, I left the ass end of the name off.  What a little eager guy.  I'm like, ooh, that's a good one.  I still got the visual, though.  That's fucking hilarious. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, if Ash Simpson could hear that.  So eager to get it out.  I'll just leave the end of his name off.  They'll know what it was.  Hey, master.  Hey, master.  Little Jimmy Nook.  Hey, my heart and my...  Hey, it's the Tony Duh.  It's Anthony Cuff.  Shut up.  Yeah, all right.  Can we drill that into the ground?  So we got an example of the DJs being a little wacky here. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  This was some of the fine programming last night on what?  ABC, I think?  I don't know.  Whatever.  NBC.  Hey, what's going on?  I'm Ben Affleck.  I can't cry.  It's a loser without a mic.  I'm Jamie White, and I'm playing the part of the Fat Paris Hilton.  Thank you, Fat Paris Hilton.  I'm Jojo Wright.  Once every year, they take the time to put us radio guys on television, and this is what happens.  It's the Radio Music Awards.  They got to put us on.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Well, by the way, this is all we know how to do.  Hey, over, ball, and sit by the hour.  Play the hits and pop in the zits. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  God, that's good.  Playing the hits and popping the zits.  They all just can't say enough.  They're all just got to chime in.  She has that sexy, broken-up, laryngitis girl voice.  Right, right.  But she's probably a slob.  I think that one's pretty hot, actually.  Get out of here, really?  Yeah, I think she's kind of hot.  God, I hate when that happens.  But the funniest thing is that they were acting like... 
[01:38:30]  The record skipped.  They were acting like wacky DJs, but they're wacky DJs.  They're wacky DJs trying to act like wacky DJs.  You get it?  Yeah.  They're trying to be ironic, but they're actually portraying themselves accurately.  There you go.  Bravo.  Look at Ashley Simpson.  Now she's on the Today Show.  I know.  An exclusive interview.  This really worked for her, I think.  I don't think there were enough people that...  I don't think she had this credibility that was going to be broken up by her lip-syncing. 
[01:39:00]  So what it's done is gotten her on all kinds of TV shows.  Everyone was watching her last night to see what she sounded like live.  Now she's doing all the talk shows.  I think it was a pretty good move.  You might be right, but I also think this is damage control.  This is real damage control.  That was a bad thing that happened.  Yeah, it was.  I'm not saying it couldn't be, but...  It's kind of working for her now.  It's going to work for her for a little while, like Jim said, but I think she's going to  eat it in the end.  Yeah, you eat it.  It's not like she's good.  If she was a good singer, then I'd go, oh, all right, she really can sing. 
[01:39:30]  But I think she really stinks, and then people are like, ugh, she stinks.  Doing her stupid dance.  Oh, here it goes.  You show a clip of her stupid dance.  And then she stops, and then she starts doing some kind of river dance thing.  Oh, it's hilarious.  And she does the hokey...  The hoedown.  The hoedown thing.  That DNA's a bitch, man.  You got Jessica Simpson that's just so freaking hot and stupid.  Yeah, hotter than hot.  Big cans.  And then her sister, look at that.  The DNA's mixed around a little differently, and look.  It's like Patrick Swayze's retarded brother.  Yeah, exactly.  You ever see Patrick Swayze? 
[01:40:00]  Like, when the chicks really dug Patrick Swayze in the 80s, and then they parade out  Patrick Swayze's brother on the talk shows.  We get like a guest shot on the A-team or something.  And you saw him come on, and you're like, wow, what happened to Patrick Swayze?  Patrick Swayze.  No, but it's got to be him, because it looks like him, but it looks like him retarded.  And then you find out it's Patrick Swayze's brother.  That's what Ashley's like.  It's like Jessica's retarded little sister.  Man, she did not get the looks in the family.  I don't like her stupid Davy Jones hairdo. 
[01:40:30]  She really is awful.  All right, well, we got Ashley Simpson.  Ooh.  You know, Eric Logan did that corporate little speech for us yesterday.  Yeah.  And then they took our production room away for three or four days, and they want this  show more gooder.  Thanks.  And we have this, you know, Ashley Simpson is on the Today Show exclusive interview.  We could have cut up the audio really fast and made something good out of it today.  No.  But we don't have a production studio.  Well, they're building something, Opie.  And eventually they'll kick everyone out. 
[01:41:00]  We'll have the whole floor.  His speech had the worst timing, is what it comes down to.  Well, yeah.  Give us the rah-rah speech and then take away more of the tools to make this show better.  Uh-huh.  Hello?  The rah-rah speech.  Oh, that was just awful.  It was a rah-rah speech.  What I'm going to do is rip apart your studio and put all the parts in a bucket.  Right.  I'm going to cart the bucket out of here so you can't use the production studio anymore.  That's the bucket filled with things we cannot control.  But we're going to bring in a new bucket with all new things.  Let's say the studio is the field that the World Series is going to be played on. 
[01:41:30]  You guys are the Yankees.  You won't be going to that field.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Eric.  And a more perfect analogy would have been, here's the bucket of things that you can control,  and here's the dumpster of things that you can't.  How about the thimble dumpster analogy?  I was going to say thimble.  Damn it.  Thimble dumpster is more funny.  All right.  Well, we got Ashley Simpson on this Radio Music Awards last night.  Oh, she can sing.  She can sing.  We could have the current stuff, but we don't have a production studio today, so we'll have 
[01:42:00]  to go to last night's audio.  Everyone was freaking.  She was going to sing live.  All right.  You guys got to step your game up and get the show a little bit boom, boom, boom.  You know, you got to bang on some better boom, boom, boom.  Listen to how hokey this is, and listen to how the crowd just ate it up, Anthony.  She fakes it.  Just ate it up.  Now, what do you do if your big sister has her own MTV series and sells millions of albums?  Well, it's simple.  You get your own MTV series, and you sell millions of albums.  And now, live, yes, live, live, on the RMS stage, please give it up for Ashley Simpson. 
[01:42:30]  Listen, listen.  It's a wrong song.  It's a wrong song, guys.  Oh, yeah.  Just kidding, you guys.  Oh, that's so funny.  That's hilarious.  Isn't that great?  You think you know me? 
[01:43:00]  The word on the street is that you do.  You are my history.  Sorry.  You don't know how you want that.  I love it now.  I love everyone.  Listen to her.  She's nothing.  You know that it's real.  It's a nine million sun.  She's trying for, I think she's trying for a Gwen Stefani thing. 
[01:43:30]  There's a little bit of that she's trying for.  A little Fiona Apple, maybe?  She's trying for, yeah, maybe a little of that thrown in.  That affected voice where she, like, all the words have to be whined.  Definitely Fiona Apple.  Yeah, there's something there.  That's so true.  And she's trying to be the Avril Lavigne a little bit.  She wants to be, like, rock chick.  God.  And she's none.  She stinks.  I mean, she really stinks.  She's awful. 
[01:44:00]  Her voice has the range of Mark Parenteau's sexual preference.  Is there any more of that song?  I hope we can hear, like, another line or something.  I don't mean to jump in and cause production problems.  Yeah, you should hear her affected voice.  That's all we wanted.  I want more.  I think she's good.  Just a little sample.  Oh, no, we do have, though.  She's terrible.  This is just, this is, it gets hokier.  Then Carson Daly interviewed Ashley Simpson.  Is Carson done yet?  Nah, he's the big new star, man. 
[01:44:30]  Is that thing done?  No, they love him.  NBC loves Carson Daly.  They love him?  Yeah, they sure do.  Does anyone watch the show?  Oh, Jim Norton.  Loves Carson.  Oh, well, you were on Carson Daly?  No, he was on the show.  He was on the show.  Actually, we met him.  He's a cool guy.  Yeah.  It's just, I'm not into his talk show.  I cannot watch it.  Well, he interviews Ashley after her performance.  Listen to this.  We have you here live exclusively.  And, of course, I have to ask you the question.  Are your sister's boobs real? 
[01:45:00]  Yes, they're very real.  That was a good question, too.  Okay, good.  Oh, and the Saturday Night Live thing.  Oh, yeah.  This must be driving you crazy.  What happened?  I like that question better.  Not the Saturday Night Live one, the boob one.  You know, it's crazy, but, you know, you move on and whatever.  You know, things happen.  I'm a human being and, you know.  And you haven't been feeling well with people.  They're just now saying something was wrong with your throat.  I had severe acid reflux.  And the day of Saturday Night Live, I actually completely lost my voice. 
[01:45:30]  And the rehearsal was going great.  And then, you know, comes like, you know, four hours to the show and I lost my voice.  All right.  Well, thank you for talking to us.  All right.  Ashley Simpson, everybody.  Ellen Kaye, back to you.  So she took care of this acid reflux in two days, I guess.  Because it was Saturday night, not even two days.  Well, she took some Tums.  Yeah.  Tum to Tum Tums.  And that's all she needed.  Tums.  What a fraud.  How do you spell relief?  C-U-N-T. 
[01:46:00]  What a fraud.  Fraud.  All right.  Yeah.  I guarantee you, I'm glad the MTV Music Awards just passed because you know they would  have brought her out.  Oh, sure.  Done another little gag.  She stinks.  On ice.  I mean, it's mind-boggling how awful she is.  Like, her real voice is brutal.  And there's plenty of talented people out there that'll never, ever get the shot.  Absolutely.  That's how it works.  She has no range.  She's got no control over her voice.  She's not a real singer. 
[01:46:30]  She can't dance either.  That awful move.  Oh, and then not even just the awful wacky move she was doing on SNL, but last night.  If you see a clip of last night's performance at that Radio Music Awards, horrific.  She's doing a dance.  It looks like a convulsion.  I swear to God.  It's a River Phoenix dance that she does.  Awful.  Do the Viper.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, guys. 
[01:47:00]  They're just cute little poops.  Oh, there's another cute one.  The milk duds shooting at our ass.  Holy ass.  What is that?  I don't know.  A gas station fire.  Isn't that horrible that we have a TV in this studio?  No, it's great.  Because we're, like, goofing on everything.  What?  Oh, my God.  And the two kids from The Shining.  You, uh, chopped your wife and daughters up, and then you blew your brains out.  Sorry to differ with you, sir.  This guy's pissed off at us. 
[01:47:30]  Jeremy, what's up?  Oh, no, I'm not pissed.  I just think, you know, you've got to lighten up on Jessica Simpson.  She's big and famous, and she has a little brother who's giving it a go.  Her voice hasn't even changed yet.  Give him time to go through puberty.  Ah, suck that cock.  We're not talking about him.  We're talking about her.  Oh, that's a woman?  Yeah, see, that was the joke.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  I'm a literal idiot.  That was the joke.  I'm sorry, man.  The joke was that she's kind of manly.  So, I don't know if she's manly.  She's just not, she doesn't have that sex appeal that her sister has. 
[01:48:00]  Not at all.  She doesn't have it.  It's a huge drop-off from Jessica to Ashley.  Her sister wears those dresses with the low-cut tops and everything, and it's just big, huge  cans hanging out.  She's dumb as dirt.  Or, actually, what I like saying now, she's dumb as Danza.  I like that.  Dumb as Danza.  Kind of rolls off the tongue.  Dumb as Danza.  Oh, new contest.  Dumb as Danza.  Are you as stupid as me?  Dumb as Danza.  She is.  Hold on, hold on.  And for some reason, for some reason that men can't figure out, that is very attractive. 
[01:48:30]  She's blonde, stupid, and has huge cans.  And her sister, trying to not be Jessica, dyes her hair black, and has no singing talent  whatsoever, doesn't have the body, doesn't have the face, and she comes off all snotty.  This kills me.  Yeah.  Who was that?  That was Tony.  Barney Rubble laugh.  Tony's part of our show now.  He reacts to what's going on in the studio. 
[01:49:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Let me hear a little.  I'm feeling pretty good, I gotta tell you.  I gotta tell you.  Hey, that's a spicy meat to ball.  It's a beautiful day.  I'm doing a Columbus Day parade.  I'm excited.  I'm Italian.  You know what I mean?  I got everything today.  You know what he is to Italians?  Like step and fetch it is to black people.  Like Sambo.  Like little black Sambo is to black people.  Like a big, fat Aunt Jemima with the thing on her head. 
[01:49:30]  That's what it is.  Old sleep and eat.  That's what he is.  That's what he is to Italians.  Hey, I'm the dumb Dago, huh?  Everything's cool.  He should be forced to sing.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  I'm in a bush.  Maybe he should dance on Abe Vagoda's feet.  Makes me nauseous. 
[01:50:00]  Mike and P.A., what's up?  A stereotypical Dago.  Mike A.  How are you doing?  Good.  What's going on?  Love your show.  All right.  But I just want to give Jimmy some feedback.  Hi.  Jimmy, you're funny as shit.  Thank you.  But.  Uh-oh.  Stinks, stupid, and awful.  I want you to go home tonight and read the thesaurus and come up with some new words.  No, dude.  That's just the way I talk.  I'm not going to come up.  I'm not Dennis Miller.  I'm not going to try to be obscure.  I just speak the way I speak. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's odiferous.  Yeah.  It's funny, but it'd be cool to throw a new word in once in a while.  All right.  I do stink.  How about this?  Asshole caller.  How's that?  How's that for a new term?  How's that?  I hope you die in a gas station fire.  Well, they didn't die.  I know, but that's what I'm saying.  The video's crazy, though.  That guy smells bad.  So what happened with this gas station fire?  I don't know.  It looks like a car plowed right into the.  No, it looked like it was sitting there, but did you see the roof of it collapsed? 
[01:51:00]  No, the whole thing went sideways.  They came in.  Yeah.  The car hit it, right?  Yeah.  Big Kev?  There was one car that hit the pumps in the middle, and it fell onto another car.  Turn off the pumps, Hap.  Turn off the pumps.  All right.  Let's say hi to Wes in New Jersey.  Hey, Wes.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I used to listen to you guys on WNEW all the time.  Love you.  I'm excited.  Hi.  Ah, yes.  All right.  I don't have X in my work truck, so I was listening to K-Rock this morning, and I heard the beginning 
[01:51:30]  of a douchebag show.  Sorry.  Ah.  And he said everybody that goes up against him is going to be a loser, because he's the  number one, and he's the first one I'd try out satellite radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, first one.  How can he keep saying he's the first one to go to satellite radio when we had a huge  New York Times feature this past Sunday?  I said I was the first one, but I had acid reflux, so perhaps that's why I said it.  I have time to call him and say, you douchebags, ONA's been on for a month already, and they're 
[01:52:00]  going to be two years ahead of you.  Yeah, I don't get how he's trying to say he's the first one when we're getting a ton of coverage.  The New York Times had a huge article on us on Sunday.  It's kind of weird, huh?  He's the first one.  There you go.  You can't really hide the fact that we beat you to it.  And do you really consider Sirius a satellite radio company at this point?  Yeah.  They are such a distant second, it's not even funny.  They have tens of listeners out there.  And then the announcement that's coming out is just going to be ridiculous after today. 
[01:52:30]  It's a biggie.  It's a biggie.  It's a huge announcement going down at one o'clock.  We're going to the press conference, I think, right?  Are we?  Are we allowed?  Yeah.  Are they proud of us enough to allow us to stand there as they make this huge announcement?  Here's two buckets.  Swear them over your heads during the press conference.  And there's other announcements around the corner.  I mean, it's not even a race anymore.  It's just a big one.  It's a huge announcement.  The technology end of this business, as far as the units go and what you listen to this 
[01:53:00]  fine program on, leaps and bounds ahead.  Leaps and bounds.  You'd be pleasantly surprised to see what the future holds.  I like Sirius' units, though, because every unit comes with a coupon for an orthopedic  back surgeon.  When you lug that hunk of shit to your vehicle, that 50-pound dead weight of mediocrity to  stick in your car. 
[01:53:30]  No, it's going to happen.  We're going to announce what we're going to announce today.  Can we even say it?  It's all over the place.  No, I can't announce it.  It's a big secret.  It's a big secret.  What?  It's a big secret.  Because I want to talk about what Sirius is going to come out.  You can't.  I can just say this.  You can't announce it.  All right.  I'm just going to say this.  Wall Street.  I'm just going to say this, okay?  What, Opie?  You know, XM is way ahead in the technology, and they come out with all these great new  products, and then Sirius tries to quickly come up with their version.  Right.  It's like two guys with a soldering iron in a closet somewhere trying to build something 
[01:54:00]  to compete.  So their version, which I hear is well over a year to two years away, is going to include  a backpack to carry it around.  Oh, that's great.  A backpack.  You're going to need a backpack to carry it around.  A knapsack.  And that's how they're going to compete with what we're about to announce today.  There you go.  Isn't that great?  Everyone knows those freaking backpacks.  That's how clunky their version is going to be in two years from now.  There you go.  I wonder if you get like a little free stuffed dog with every purchase. 
[01:54:30]  You can pet it while you're listening to your 40-pound radio.  Hey, Jim, you're going to be in Sacramento, right?  Oh, yeah.  November 5, 6.  Thank you, Opie, for that little plug.  I forgot all about it.  Punchline Comedy Club.  Next weekend.  Is that next weekend?  Yeah, a week from this weekend.  There you go.  That's what I meant to say.  Well, Chad is checking in from Sacramento.  It's 5 in the morning in Sacramento.  What's up, Chad?  Chad?  He fell asleep.  He's been on hold since the show started.  Chad, you still there?  Oh, my God. 
[01:55:00]  He's snoring.  Listen.  Oh, he fell asleep.  Listen, listen.  It's Anthony at yesterday's meeting.  It is really early in Sacramento.  That's why.  He probably was waiting on hold, and he fell asleep.  Well, we started the show at 6, so, you know, he was probably just getting his night done  and figured he'll get a quick call into us, and we put him on hold for two hours, and now  he's snoring away.  Listen.  There he is, Sawnwood. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  You know, I could be a good guy and just hang up on him, but we're going to keep him there  for the rest of the show.  No, leave him on hold.  See how long he stays there.  So he has a nice, fine phone bill, because this is a long-distance call.  Listen.  Long-distance.  There he is.  Well, he has a massage parlor he wanted to turn you on to when you go to Sacramento.  Sounds like an exciting one, doesn't it? 
[01:56:00]  God, he's out cold.  All right, we'll keep him on hold.  We'll check in with him as the show goes on here.  Let's say hi to Steve in Illinois, which is officially the sexiest state in America.  Sexiest state.  What's up, Steve?  That's right.  That's right.  We got some horny women in Illinois.  That's right.  Hell yeah.  So what's going on today?  I've been trying to get a hold of you guys for a while.  I didn't know about you.  I listen to you guys every now and then in New York City when I was out there.  I'm a truck driver.  And I got my accent.  I tuned you guys in.  You guys fucking rock, man.  Oh, all right.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:56:30]  Thank you.  And I got Wow on the back of both of my trailer doors.  Oh, that's going to work, bro.  I'm telling you.  The girls see the Wow on the back of the trailers, and if they feel like it, they're going  to flash you as you're driving down the highway.  That's right.  And good news.  They are going to mail out the Wow stickers starting today.  Stop it.  I got to the bottom of it, and they haven't been mailing the Wow stickers out.  But after that little rah-rah speech yesterday from Eric Logan, we decided to shove it back  in his face and say, okay, what are you doing for us now?  Now what are you doing?  Now what are you doing? 
[01:57:00]  Why haven't they been mailing them out, Ope?  I don't know.  Well, we announced at least two or three weeks ago that our fine listeners could just go  to our website, and there's a place there where you just leave your address, and we would  send the Wow stickers out.  Was somebody in charge of that?  And it was two or three weeks ago we announced that, and people still haven't gotten their  Wow stickers.  So we threw it back in their face yesterday.  We said, what about the Wow stickers?  Yeah.  So I guess they're finally going to mail those out starting today.  All right.  So we should get them soon, okay?  All right. 
[01:57:30]  We should take a break.  Yes, George the Geek, somewhere in New Jersey.  We know what XM's going to announce, and a lot of people also know what XM's going to  announce because it has been in the news.  But see, the difference is there's been no official word from anyone that is representing  XM.  If we announced it, it would be an official word from XM employees.  See?  That's why.  Which is a very dangerous thing to do as far as Wall Street goes. 
[01:58:00]  We're trying to be smarter on this show.  We want to keep our jobs.  I love Wall Street.  That's right.  Oh, you do?  Oh.  I turned a nice dime yesterday.  We'll talk about that in a few minutes, okay?  Sure.  All right.  Anthony made $6,000 yesterday.  I made $6,000 in about, yeah, 45 minutes.  While playing video poker?  While I was playing video poker.  You'll explain in a couple minutes here.  I was listening to some rap music this afternoon. 
[01:58:30]  Not that I had a choice.  It was coming out of a Jeep four miles away.  Yeah, can you turn that crap up?  I still have one eyeball left in the socket.  It's good music.  It has a message.  Kill Whitey!  And white people are dancing to it.  I love this song.  It mentions my name twice. 
[01:59:00]  I like rap, man.  I don't care when they mess with a turntable.  Sounds like a fat chick walking in corduroys.  Please welcome MC Chafe.  Remember, they call rap, they call scratching an art form.  Remember the old days?  You were at a party.  You bumped into the turntable.  You're an asshole.  Now you're a musical genius.  Is he drunk?  No, he's cutting an album. 
[01:59:30]  F**k!  F**k!  F**k!  Get away from the turntable, Bill.  F**k you, I'm good.  Give me a contract.  Now rappers are shooting each other, huh?  Finally.  If we could just get the country and western people to join in,  it'll be a perfect world.  I'd hate to see Billy Ray Cyrus take a cap in the achy, breaky ass. 
[02:00:00]  Huh?  That would suck.  Boy, we wouldn't want to lose that talent, would we?  Rappers are shooting each other.  It's getting crazy over music, man.  Remember the old days?  There was a shooting.  Cops used to look through mug photos.  Now they look through the R&B section at Tower Records.  So, uh, what's, uh, I need a vacation.  Obviously, I'm a tad stressed, and, uh...  You're driving. 
[02:00:30]  This is your daily commute.  You tune in your XM radio.  You pay little attention, if any, to the road.  You're approaching the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  Suddenly, for no apparent reason, you pull the wheel strongly to the right.  Your car is pole vaulted into the air.  Gravity takes a hold, and you head to the water. 
[02:01:00]  The impact is like concrete.  Then you slowly submerge.  Feeling the cold presence of wetness, oxygen is slowly purged from your vehicle.  And for a moment, you think to yourself,  Man, my XM radio sounds so good.  Man.  Man. 
[02:01:30]  Listen to this crowd roar!  The game that was born on the radio now joins the next generation of radio.  XM Satellite Radio is now the official satellite service of Major League Baseball.  Starting in 2005, XM will bring you live play-by-play broadcasts of every Major League game all season long.  From spring training to the World Series.  Now you can hear your hometown team wherever you are.  And it's all part of your basic monthly XM plan.  Major League Baseball, coming to XM in 2005. 
[02:02:00]  It's radio to the power of X.  Thanks for calling Liquid Metal.  A representative will be right with you.  Liquid Metal is criminally hard music and offensive.  It has also been known to cause inner ear hemorrhaging.  Go check out Channel 42.  XMLM appreciates you holding.  Someone will be right with you.  Radio to the power of X. 
[02:02:30]  XM Satellite Radio.  Did you just put a firecracker in my vagina?  I just wanted to see what would happen.  No, no.  Get it out.  Come on.  What's the big deal?  I'll be fine.  Are you fucking crazy?  What are you doing with that later?  I'm coming closer.  If you blow up my pussy, I'm going to bludgeon you.  Oh, stop.  Relax.  I'm just screwing around.  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:00]  I am so sorry.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What?  No.  Norton has acid reflux in the studio once again this morning.  No.  Oh, my God.  Was that?  That was Kev.  Oh, my God.  That was frigging Kev.  That was Kev.  No.  Not a lot.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Kev, was that you?  No, you fucker.  God damn it. 
[02:03:30]  What?  Get on the mic.  Oh, my God.  He farted like goddamn thunder five seconds before you went on the air.  No, it was like five minutes ago.  It went away, and then he farted and walked out.  Kev, you're a liar.  We're trying to become professional broadcasters.  This isn't helping us.  Who farted?  Who did it?  I know he farted.  Loud as thunder.  There was nothing.  It was a dud.  Believe it.  Did you fart or not?  Five minutes ago.  And did he fart?  Yes, just now.  I did not fart.  That is a lie.  Dude.  Don't be ashamed.  I'm not ashamed.  You let one loose in Philly that you still haven't claimed. 
[02:04:00]  That was not me.  That was so you.  We were hanging out doing our promotional tour in Philly, and Anthony and I are doing the  thing, taking pictures, signing autographs, and there's a whole group of people around  us, and we're just kind of shooting the ass, you know?  And all of a sudden, this fart was let loose, and I know it wasn't Norton, because Norton  wasn't around.  The whole area completely cleared.  Cleared out.  Completely.  Completely.  And everyone was just horrified, and everyone was saying it was you, it wasn't me.  Sure.  Blame the fat guy. 
[02:04:30]  Aren't you ashamed?  Yes, I'm ashamed.  We didn't bring your fatness into this.  I did.  We were just talking about your just awful ass gas.  Ashley Simpson was performing.  Speaking of which, Balloon Knot Joe in New York City writes on the Instant Feedback, Ashley  Simpson, Anthony, she was hopping around the stage trying to shake a log she let go, hoping  it would fall out near her ankle due to acid reflux.  Right.  Anthony, you made $6,000 last night? 
[02:05:00]  Yes.  Made a quick six grand.  How about that?  As I was playing online poker.  You're winning with online poker?  No, party poker.  Partypoker.com.  I thought you weren't really winning with that game.  No, I'm not.  I kind of stay right about where I am.  I might lose $50, $75 one day, and then I'm up $75 the next day.  But no, that wasn't what I was doing.  As I'm playing party poker, I go to check my email, and on Yahoo, I have all my little 
[02:05:30]  stocks that are on the side, looking at our great Citadel stock, which just blows monkey  ass.  It's down to, what, $13?  And Fareed blows monkey ass.  Oh.  Way to throw us under the bus, you ass.  Thanks, Fareed.  Thanks for that inside edge, that inside little Wall Street angle that he gave us.  We got in on the IPO, which is the initial public offering of this stock that was coming 
[02:06:00]  out for Citadel.  $19 a share.  That's what it was being offered at.  But you get in early.  You get this great $19 price, and you buy it, and it's supposed to go up.  Yeah.  No.  We had the privilege of getting in at $19 a share and watched it just plummet to $13 a  share.  It's around $13.50 today, I think?  $13.50, somewhere around there.  Great, thanks.  $5.50.  With no sign of it coming back to $19. 
[02:06:30]  And that was my retirement money.  I'm so screwed, man.  That's my retirement fund.  Maybe if we worked for Fareed, the stock would have went up, I guess.  Yeah, perhaps.  He was very pissed off when we decided to go to Satellite Radio instead of his fine, very  small company.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Thanks.  Hmm.  Be heard all over the country on Satellite Radio, or go to Citadel and be heard in Wilkes-Barre  and Buffalo.  Hmm.  Scranton.  Scranton.  I don't know what we should do, Anthony. 
[02:07:00]  I remember the phone call to you.  I don't know.  What do we do?  Let's see.  We go on Satellite Radio.  We're heard in New York City, L.A., Philly, Washington, Boston, every city in between.  Or to the Amish.  Or go to Citadel and broadcast to the Amish.  Exactly.  Hmm.  Oh, no.  But what he wanted was us to give up on the dream of being heard in New York City.  He said, you know, let's give it some time.  Mm-hmm.  I think you guys are so effed in this industry that we need to start you in a small little 
[02:07:30]  radio market.  Thanks for the beat down.  He's like, how about we make you the new morning guys in Reno, Nevada?  Ooh, there we go.  This late in our career, we're going to go that far backwards and go to Reno, Nevada and  do a morning show.  And he's like, and then in six to eight months, this is how radio fucks think.  And I hate, I swear to God, I hate just about everybody in this business.  They are awful.  Because they all think they know more than Anthony and I.  They just don't.  No. 
[02:08:00]  So this guy, and he used to be a friend of ours, and I say used to because after we signed  with Satellite Radio, then he throws us under the bus and talks bad about us and says that  the whole satellite radio industry should be regulated, and Opie and Anthony went for  the money instead of the smart move, which was to go back and commercial radio.  He just trashed us.  It was the smart move.  So he wanted to put us in Reno, Nevada to do mornings for six to eight months, Anthony,  in one tiny little market.  And then six to eight months down the road, we'll look at it, and we'll maybe try to get 
[02:08:30]  you back on a New York City radio station.  Thanks.  Thank you, Fareed.  Thanks.  No.  No thank you.  So the point?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Citadel stock.  I'm playing.  Yeah.  Citadel stock plummeted.  Okay.  Went down to $1,350, and now that's where it sits.  And I don't see any sign that it's coming back.  Do you?  No.  No.  Goddamn thing's been downgraded by everybody.  Commercial radio's so effed, I just don't see how the Citadel stock is going to bounce 
[02:09:00]  back.  I know.  I just don't see it.  It's going to be scooped up by somebody, maybe.  I don't know.  So now it's just yet another stock that's got to sit there because you can't sell it.  Right, right.  Because you lost money on it, so now it's just got to sit there and wait.  Kind of like my American Tower stock.  Yeah.  Hope's got another one of those.  Finally making a comeback.  Boy.  Anthony sold his at $50 a share, I believe.  Yep.  And we got that one for free.  That was our raise back in the Boston days.  Right.  Bruce E. Midman got us those.  Yeah.  Instead of giving us a raise. 
[02:09:30]  Instead of money, I'll give you these stocks.  Boys, I know you don't know anything about the stock market, but I'm going to give you options,  boys.  Yeah, boys.  Boys, you're going to get 2,000 shares, but we're only going to invest 400 shares a year,  so you're going to have to stay with me for five years to get all 2,000 shares.  Yeah.  B-b-b-boys.  Thanks, Bruce.  But then we got fired and we got all 2,000 shares.  Yep.  See, we're very smart.  Right.  We're smarter than you think.  And Opie still holds those shares.  What are they worth now?  I was smart, then I got really stupid. 
[02:10:00]  Anthony sold his at, wasn't it in the 40s?  Yeah.  45 or so?  Yeah, around that time.  $45 a share.  That was a long time ago.  So you made like $90,000 on that puppy.  I did?  That much?  Well, minus half, but you made 90,000.  Yeah.  I think I had to give away half.  It says somewhere you made 90,000 on that transition.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, man, this thing's going higher, Anthony.  We don't know crap about the stock market.  This thing went down at $2 a share.  Anthony got out, made 90,000.  Mine was worth 4,000. 
[02:10:30]  4,000.  But it's making a comeback.  I think it's up to like $15 or $16 a share.  I'm getting there.  Is it?  You're getting there?  I'm getting there slowly.  Slowly working your way back up.  So anyway, the stock market.  Oh, so yesterday, now I log on to my dusty E-Trade account, which I used to play with  a lot back in the older days, because I noticed Google.  No Google came out two months ago or so.  It IPO was...  Let's talk about an IPO.  What was the IPO price?  About $80 a share.  Oh, my God.  It was pretty high.  Pretty high. 
[02:11:00]  But it went up to over $100 on the first day of trading alone, so the people made money.  And talk about not looking back.  This thing has just kept climbing and climbing and climbing.  A couple of days ago, had a $25 day.  Went up $25 in one day.  I haven't seen movement like that in any stock in years.  Since the old dot-com bubble that everyone loves to talk about.  But that thing went...  Yeah.  That thing just went crazy.  $25.  So yesterday, I check it out. 
[02:11:30]  It's up at about, I don't know, maybe 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  It's up $11 on the day.  So I'm thinking, hmm.  Now, I don't have enough money to dump in and buy this thing, which is now at about $170-something a share.  But there are options.  Options.  I bought these options.  Stock options.  It's the option to buy the stock at a certain set price.  So I pick some up.  It winds up costing me $6,000 I had in my E-Trade account.  I'm like, okay, let me buy these options. 
[02:12:00]  And with options, you're not actually buying anything.  You're buying the privilege of buying this stock at a certain price.  So if the options expire, which they do, they have expiration dates, you're left with nothing.  With zero zip zilch.  So you're risking the money.  It's not like you can hold on to it hoping it goes up.  I'm so confused, but I'm kind of with you.  Yeah.  I do the basic stock trading.  Yeah.  No, you've got to get in heavy.  I don't do the pusses and the options.  It was a call.  And call.  What? 
[02:12:30]  It was $195 strike price, November call.  What?  That's what it was.  Bought it for $6,000 at about 1 o'clock.  All right.  At about 2 o'clock, I punched out.  It was worth $12,000, Opie.  You made $6,000 in a couple hours?  I made six grand on that trip.  That's right.  I was thrilled.  And at the same time, I'm getting pissed off because at the same time I'm doing this,  I'm playing poker online. 
[02:13:00]  Video poker, yes.  Video poker.  And I'm getting mad because I'm losing like $4 to some guy that had a flush.  And I had to straight and I'm yelling at the computer.  You know, I've got to put things in perspective sometimes, which I can't do when I'm playing video poker.  I get very angry when I lose.  Even if it's like, you know, it's like five bucks, I'm very angry.  I have a flush.  Someone has a full house.  I'll spit at the screen.  Like, you mother.  I'm cursing.  And you're still getting pissed even though you're up $6,000 on the. 
[02:13:30]  On the day.  On the stock market.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you think the stock market is going to pull you back in?  Please, God.  With plays like that?  Please, no.  Please, no.  As a matter of fact, well, no, you know something?  We only have a half hour on the air when the market opens.  I think that's the reason we really went to mornings.  To prevent you from day trading.  From day trading?  During the radio show.  I'm going to look at 930 and see what it's doing.  And see what you could do today?  And perhaps I could work some magic today.  We'll see what happens.  You've got to tell the people, you were day trading live during our radio show. 
[02:14:00]  We've talked about this many times.  There are times I'm trying to make some incredible point on our stupid radio show.  I look at Anthony and he's not even paying attention.  He's trying to get out of stocks and buy new ones.  And it was just a nightmare.  But there was a point you were up like $100,000, wasn't it?  Weren't you up $100,000?  Yes, I was up $100,000.  $100,000.  I had turned a $10,000 initial investment that I put into the E-Trade account into a little over $90,000.  Right. 
[02:14:30]  And it went away in about a week.  You lost it all.  In about a week.  I'm like, well, this is easy.  You go, oh my God, I could make, you know, you start thinking, oh my God, I could turn this into a million, I bet.  And you just heavy up.  And I heavied up on a lot of stock options, you know, because that was the easiest way.  You could leverage so much stock for such a little amount of money, comparatively speaking.  And the bottom fell out of the market, like everyone remembers.  And my options became worthless.  And I lost the money. 
[02:15:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  Can't you just say, look, I made a mistake.  I'd like to go back and get my money and they'll give it to you?  Yeah, that works sometimes.  Actually, who's this?  Chubsy Ubsy in Jersey.  Boys, when will Beaks show up with the crop report?  All right.  Hey, we got an old friend checking in, Anthony.  The first time on the brand new radio show, it's Carlos Mencia.  Carlos.  What is up, studs?  Carlos. 
[02:15:30]  Are you calling from L.A.?  Yeah, yeah, I'm in Los Angeles, so it's like the crack of my ass dawn here.  I know.  That's what sucks about us doing morning radio.  All our friends in L.A. have to get up nice and early or don't go to bed to talk to us.  Yeah, well, that's what I was doing yesterday, except my wife's, it was my birthday on October 22nd,  which was Friday, and she flew in like people that I didn't know just out of nowhere.  It was like a surprise.  So I wanted to get crazy yesterday, but the family was upstairs, dude. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  You guys doing that fucking song?  I thought it would, you know, help the mood.  Yeah, we're trying to wake you up a little bit, Carlos.  No, no, I'm fine, dude.  I'm awake.  All right.  I wasn't awake yesterday, too.  I was just afraid to, you know, I was just afraid to throw out a big fat funk on the radio.  Hey, are you calling us from your living room?  No.  I hear the echo, because I've been in Carlos' house in L.A., and he's got like... 
[02:16:30]  Oh, you have, Opie.  He's got like the...  Well, when I was kind of quantum leaping all over America in our time off, I hung out with  Carlos a little bit in L.A., and he's got the biggest living room I've ever seen.  You can play like tennis in his living room.  Really?  It's ridiculous.  It's fucking big in there, isn't it?  It's huge.  So they threw you a surprise party?  Yeah, it was awesome, which normally I hate surprises, man, but it was cool.  I just was like so, you know, scared to say something, you know, because, I mean, they don't know me like that, you know what I mean? 
[02:17:00]  I'm like the...  I'm like the Ned to them, you know?  I'm like, oh, Ned, he's so nice, and he cheats on how he's nice, and he's got this big house, and oh, look how cute he is.  And, you know, they don't know Carlos like that, man, so I was like, guys, I can't do this tonight, today, because it's too much, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I hear you.  You sound very sleepy.  No, no, I'm fine, dude. 
[02:17:30]  Do I sound sleepy?  Yeah, you got that just woke up voice.  Yeah, because we've been up for about four and a half hours.  I used to have the just woke up voice when I tried to call in sick for work, or call in like with car trouble, because I was late, and I was going to show up at like 10 o'clock instead of 8 o'clock, and I just woke up, and I had to call the boss, and I'd be like, yeah, no, I got car trouble.  Yeah, the battery's dead, but I've been out for like two hours trying to get it started.  And he knew I was lying, because I just had that gravelly morning voice. 
[02:18:00]  That's kind of what you're sporting there.  Yeah, well, you know, whatever, dude.  It's 5 o'clock.  What do you expect?  That's true.  You know what, it's easy to have a happy voice when you just made $6,000 fucking dollars in your sleep, you know?  Yeah.  Anthony, $6,000.  Hey, believe me, I'd lose it, too.  There have been plenty of times I've lost.  I made $90,000.  I started with $10,000, you know?  That's a good day.  And I'm the retarded beaner having like, you know, because I'm starting to make decent money, so what I have is the opposite.  I have all these other guys coming up and going, you know, you need to invest, and you need to put it in this, and this is a great stock. 
[02:18:30]  And I'm going, I don't fucking know any of this.  Carlos, we were just talking about that last week on the show, because we got people like that coming after us.  We're like, we don't need retirement funds.  We don't need 401Ks.  Shut up.  You guys are going to do it.  I'm getting that all over the place now.  Oh, you need to invest and fund it, and then you can put money in and take it out, but it's really a loan, so you're not paying any money back. 
[02:19:00]  And I'm going, what the fuck is this shit?  Can I just get like some tacos, put them in the freezer, and eat them later on in the microwave?  Yeah, I just want to...  Just put the money in the bank and leave it there.  I just want enough money in my ATM account.  That's all I care about.  They're like, you now need life insurance.  You now need to make a will.  Anthony made a great point.  He wants, he's not going to make a will, and he wants his family to just fight over his money when he goes.  I want some excitement for my family.  I want them just at each other's throat. 
[02:19:30]  A loving family that we've loved each other for years and years and years, our entire lives.  I don't remember one family dispute, and I just want that torn asunder when I go.  I want them clawing at each other's eyeballs for every possession I have.  Or give it to the one sibling that the rest of the family knew that you just hated.  Or one relative.  Or one relative, right.  That's a good one.  I'm going to do the opposite.  I'm going to give one of my sisters a little bit more than the other sister. 
[02:20:00]  Resentment.  A little bit less than the other sister.  If they're in a life after death, I want to see that look on their eyes.  When he, you know, that, that, why the fuck do you get $3,000 more?  What did she do?  This is bullshit.  I carried that little motherfucker when he had a broken arm.  You didn't do shit, you know?  Whose couch did he sleep on?  Whose couch was he sleeping on when he didn't even have a goddamn house?  Exactly.  I want that.  You know, when he was broken, he started doing comedy. 
[02:20:30]  I was the one that lent him a car.  He took my car.  How could you get more than me?  Oh, I'm going to laugh my ass because I already get that.  Comics are the worst because you guys just pretty much didn't have any life before comedy.  And you get into comedy because you're too lazy to actually have a real job.  So there's a point in every comic's life where they pretty much have nothing.  No car, no place to live.  You're sapping off your friends. 
[02:21:00]  And then when you kind of make good, sometimes these people expect things.  And when you finally go, leave them nothing.  Because they're probably expecting it.  Surprise, jack off, you get nothing.  The people whose couches I slept on, the people who drove me places, nothing.  Dude, I'm already getting that.  That's why I'm laughing.  I'm already getting, like, the brother that's pissed off.  You know what I mean?  Because, like, my favorite brother right now is my brother Joseph, who's, like, he used to be, you know, a gambler, an addict. 
[02:21:30]  And he was, you know, always drunk.  But he was the guy that, when I first started doing comedy, was, like, down because I was the opposite.  I was, like, the smart kid.  You know what I mean?  I was a straight-in student.  I was going to college.  I was getting my degree in engineering.  And my mom and everybody was, like, all right, he's the one.  He's the one that's going to college.  He's the one that's going to make it.  He's taking us over the top as a family. 
[02:22:00]  And then when I started, you know, doing stand-up, my family was, what are you doing, you retard?  You joke.  Throw it away, yeah.  Oh, my mom was, like, why can't you just get a job and tell Joseph your goddamn people at the work?  And I was, like, mom, I'm doing stand-up.  No idea whatsoever.  But my brother Joseph, the drunk guy, he didn't care.  He was high and drunk.  So he was, like, elige malo.  Me yuato, do de cláun.  Me le den do de cláun.  But it was cool to me because it was, like, he was my backup. 
[02:22:30]  And now my brothers, like, the older ones, it used to be, like, you know, we used to take you to soccer when you were little.  We used to take you to the movies when you were little.  Got to remind you, yeah.  You give money to Joseph, the drunk fucker.  And I was, like, hey, man.  He was there for me, bitch.  He was there for you, all right.  So now I'm doing this, now, like, I'm working on this TV show with Comedy Central, and I'm actually making Joseph a part of the show. 
[02:23:00]  Well, my family is pissed, dude.  Pissed.  Well, you got, like, 12 or 13 brothers and sisters, too, right?  18.  Oh, you'd go broke.  What, 18?  There's 18 of us.  He'd go broke, then.  He can't say.  He's got to pick and choose.  He's got 18 kids in his family.  That isn't.  And all from the same parents, right?  11 sisters and 6 brothers.  11 sisters and 6 brothers.  From the same mom, right? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, but not the same dad.  There's a couple different dads.  Yeah, but your mom had 18 births?  Jesus.  No way.  How do you do that, dude?  Come on.  No way.  How do you do that?  Dude, I...  Exactly, dude.  How is she able to hold the last few in for term?  She's doing the dishes, and it goes, oh, can someone pick that one up?  Yeah, Jesus.  Put that up.  I was 17th born, and this is a true story. 
[02:24:00]  When I was born, my mom didn't have a midwife.  She didn't have a doctor.  I think what I was...  She also didn't have a pussy at that point.  Dude.  Jeez, man.  Sorry, dude.  I know it's your mom, but jeez.  Guys, mom.  I do apologize, but I couldn't help that.  Don't, dude.  Because everyone's thinking it.  My God.  My mom's like a fucking uterus with a head.  How do you have that many kids, dude?  That's just amazing.  That is a factory. 
[02:24:30]  So what happened when you were born?  When I was born, my mom...  There was nobody to deliver the baby.  Actually, my mom said, God, I'm thirsty for milk.  And this lady who was hanging out with my mom left.  And when she came back, I was born.  You know, everything was out.  The cord was cut.  And my mom was sitting there going, you know, it came out.  And the lady freaked out.  And that's how loose, I guess.  Are you trying to say your mom's loose? 
[02:25:00]  What's wrong with you?  Jesus.  That's the sad part.  I'm 17th born.  Yeah.  And I have, like, I have a pretty big-sized head.  So my dad's pissed at me.  My dad's actually made jokes about me, you know?  Like, look at your fucking head.  You're the one that ruined it.  It wasn't that bad a person to you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You gotta be fucking...  She had 17 kids before me, and I'm the one that fucked it up for you.  It's your head.  You're the only kid in the family that has a perfectly round head.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  I'm the only...  Everybody else was a conehead.  That's what I'm saying.  Man, everyone else has the oval head.  Carlos has the perfect circle head.  16 kids went through there, and it was fine.  But you had to fucking stretch it out a little too much.  Carlos was actually able to cartwheel out.  I used to say that for the last six months I was in there, I was actually fucking holding on.  So your mom had kids from what age to what age?  My mom had kids from... 
[02:26:00]  I think the first one was 15.  So she's Hispanic.  Let's just throw that out there.  I think the first one was at 15, and the last one was at 44.  Oh, man.  Just about 30 years?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  44, dude.  And, you know, 44 back in 1970-something.  So, you know, this wasn't like now where women are having babies that old.  I mean, my mom was, you know, dude, she's... 
[02:26:30]  And I go, Dad, why'd you guys have so many kids?  You know, because when I got older, I was pretty smart.  So I go, hey, Dad, why'd you guys have so many kids?  Is it because, you know, where you guys come from, there's no Social Security,  and you guys, you know, pretty much tell us that when you get older, we've got to take care of you?  And, you know, is that such a big deal?  And it's because you're Catholic, and my dad goes, no, your mom doesn't like to suck dick. 
[02:27:00]  That's what you want to hear from your pops.  Oh, God.  Thanks for the visual, Dad.  That's hilarious.  Well, but, dude, my parents are like that, though.  I mean, my mom and dad talk about sex.  Dude, I kid you not, my dad, about a month and a half ago, he had that, you know,  he had this, he had an inflamed prostate or something,  and he had like a little tiny cyst in his prostate.  Wow.  So he's having problems, and, you know, he got it removed and stuff,  and everything's cool, and, you know, it wasn't cancerous, 
[02:27:30]  but he's having, you know, erectile dysfunction problems.  Thank God.  Yeah.  So here's how I find out.  This is no bullshit.  We're having dinner with my mom and dad, and everybody's here,  and we're all, you know, and my mom keeps laughing.  And I go, Mom, what's the matter?  And she goes, your father, he had to go to a doctor today.  And I go, Mom, that's not even funny, man.  I mean, you know, my dad had an operation.  And she goes, no, no, that's not the doctor that he went to. 
[02:28:00]  He went to the BP doctor because he can't get it up no more.  Oh.  Dude, in the middle of dinner, and I'm going, what the fuck are you guys doing?  Oh, you don't want to hear that.  No, no.  And I go, Dad, you can't get it up?  And my mom goes, no, no.  The doctor said it was fine.  It's the other doctor that told him he's fucked up.  And I go, the other doctor?  And I'm looking at my dad, and his face is fucking melting. 
[02:28:30]  And my sister goes, he had to go.  I was like, God, it's risk.  To figure out why he can't get it up anymore?  Yeah.  How old is he?  He's, what, 67?  Is he?  And I'm fucking finding this out at the dinner table, dude.  I'm just going, this is wrong, man.  Yeah, you don't want to hear that.  At the dinner table, my dad just, you know, and then my dad gets mad at me.  He goes, I'm going to get it up, and I'm going to fuck you in the ass. 
[02:29:00]  I'm biting my lip, because I can tell you why your father is not getting it up anymore.  But I got a million of them.  No, I'm not going to go there, man.  Jesus.  I've never seen your mom.  You've never seen my mom?  I don't think so.  I'm not going to say anything.  Oh, you're going to talk about it.  It was just some comments. 
[02:29:30]  A lot of vagina.  Well, yeah, I had a few lines, sure.  Yeah, maybe a little stitch or two to tighten that up might help him out.  Yeah, that might help him out a little bit.  That might be it.  Well, I think my mom actually now does go down on my dad, from what I hear.  Oh, that's nice.  You guys got an open family.  There you go.  That's a great visual.  Thanks.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  This is my family.  I mean, a lot of people think, oh, you tell those jokes and they're funny.  Dude, when I was, I remember, I remember being like nine or ten, dude, and my dad and mom 
[02:30:00]  were really, really loud one morning.  And I woke up, and my sister, Olga, you know, was like, Mom, Dad, is everything okay?  And my dad came down the stairs, and he goes, why?  And we're like, because, you know, it was really loud up in your room.  It sounds like somebody fell.  And he paused, and he actually, like, did this, like, little dance. 
[02:30:30]  And we're like, what are you doing, stupid?  And he was like, I gave it to your mother.  And I was like, oh, gross, dude.  You don't want to hear that as a kid.  You don't want to hear your dad say this.  This is what he said.  She wanted breakfast, and I gave her wheels con chorizo.  Dude, that is just wrong, man.  You Latinos are all horny motherfuckers, man.  Dude, I don't even.  You guys are just out of control.  You guys are just out of control.  And you know what?  Like, when you have this many, you can't fight it. 
[02:31:00]  You can't fight it.  You know, when people, I mean, that's why I go with the jokes.  You know, it's like you, you're biting your lip.  I'm like, why?  My mom has 18 kids, dude.  Let the jokes roll.  At least she can defend herself.  I don't want to make fun of your mom's twat.  You shouldn't even be saying that.  I know.  But we're on XM Satellite Radio.  You can say that word now.  Yeah.  My dad actually makes jokes.  This is how. 
[02:31:30]  I do a joke about roast beef, Arby, pussy lips.  You know where I got him?  My dad took me to Arby's once.  And he actually took one of those little flappy, you know, pieces of meat.  The Arby's sandwich, sure.  Yeah.  And he started making jokes about how I look like my mom's snack.  Did you gobble up that roast beef sandwich?  Dude, it was.  Get a good one.  And he did it as I was, like, putting that horseradish whitish kind of sauce in it. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just, it just, at that moment, dude, it looked so vagina-yasty.  I just couldn't go there, dude.  I couldn't eat the sandwich, man.  As long as it doesn't also smell like Arby's.  You certainly don't want that.  Or that horse ranch.  People smell like Arby's.  I met a chick last week in El Paso, Texas, that had a tattoo of a fish right on top of  her pussy.  Like, maybe an inch to the right and to the left of her pussy. 
[02:32:30]  She had a fish.  And I looked at it, and I went, is that a fish?  And she goes, it's cute, huh?  And I'm like, do you not know what you already fucking say that smells like?  Are you retarded?  I'm like, is that a scratch and sniff?  Yeah, she should have a tattoo of a rose instead.  Yeah, I agree.  What's wrong with her?  I said, what, do you have a little tattoo of a piece of shit next to your ass?  What, are you stupid?  Ah, very good. 
[02:33:00]  Is that retarded or what?  That is retarded.  All right, Carlos, we're going to let you be and get back to bed, all right?  Oh, yeah.  Now that you woke me up with the smell of my mom and the giant vagina.  Hey, Carlos, I like your house.  By the way, your mom's got a giant twat.  I didn't say that.  You did say that.  Not really.  I'm not going to tell her, bro.  All right, Carlos.  You're the man.  You want to promote anything? 
[02:33:30]  What am I doing this week?  Yeah, I'm going to be...  You know what?  Go to my website, carlosmusea.com.  Okay.  There it is, man.  And guys, it's so funny to hear you on the radio, except for those extra two or three dollars  I got to pay to fucking hear you.  Yeah.  Well, the company's kind of hiding us right now.  They're a little scared of us, we think.  Is that why they charge the extra two bucks for you guys?  Yeah, they're kind of keeping us top secret, I think.  Good idea.  We're the top secret weapon. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  They're trying to make it as hard as possible for us to hear the radio show.  That's a very smart business strategy.  Keep us in the missile silo.  Yeah, we're kind of hidden right now.  I truly believe they're just not proud of us yet.  They're still trying to figure out what we're all about.  But you guys are getting like a piece of those two dollars.  I think we get like a penny or something.  Because we have Super Agent Bob Eatman on the case.  You're kidding me.  No, I don't think we get any of that, to tell you the truth.  No, I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:34:30]  No, because that's why, I mean, part of me going, oh, I got to pay you for two bucks.  Oh, they're my buds.  It's cool, you know.  It all figures out in the end.  They pay us, and they're making money from the two bucks, and it goes to us somehow.  Yeah, we're just kind of hidden right now.  So, we'll see what happens.  Well, you know what?  You guys, honestly, I've been listening to the show, and you guys sound great, man.  Thanks, Carlos.  You really do sound great.  And, you know, it's tough, because I was thinking, you know, with what they call shock jocks, you know, when the shock is gone, and you just, you know, what's going to happen? 
[02:35:00]  But it's great.  Dude, it's so awesome, man.  Just that moment where, in your head, you're going, God, I want to talk about Carlos' mom's twat.  Well, now we can.  Exactly.  And we did.  And we did.  All right, Carlos, we're going to let you be.  All right, guys.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  All right, guys.  All right, there he goes.  Our old friend, Carlos Mencia.  Pat Philbin from Munaki, Munaki, Munaki, Munaki, Munaki, Munaki, Munaki, Munaki, I'm correcting you, Munaki, New Jersey, he quotes, it wasn't cancerous, and then in parentheses puts applause break. 
[02:35:30]  That would have been a good spot for an applause break.  Very good, Pat.  All right, we're going to step aside.  Joining right in.  Take a little break.  We're getting a lot of requests for Stephen Lynch songs.  Off his latest album, Superhero Anthony.  Yes.  We're going to play this one for the ladies. 
[02:36:00]  I kissed you on the cheek.  Good night, my love, I say.  You turn to me and smile.  A baby's on the way.  And then you drift asleep to dream of life anew.  And I lie wondering just what I should do. 
[02:36:30]  I could kick you in the stomach and catch you unawares.  I could swear to God you accidentally fell that flight of stairs.  When I tell you that I love you, I will look you in the eye.  As I slowly slide the hanger up your thigh.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  I have an uncle that went crazy. 
[02:37:00]  Crazy, man.  Everybody's got a crazy uncle.  He's usually your favorite uncle when you're a kid, too.  You don't realize he's crazy until you're about 15.  No wonder Bobby was so much fun.  He's out of his fucking mind.  My uncle Bobby lost his mind. 
[02:37:30]  You know what people do when they lose their mind?  Start repeating shit that don't mean nothing.  Every time you ask Bobby a question, you answer it the same way.  Bobby, what time is it?  If you want to feel funky, feel free.  Please don't spread that funk on me.  What did that mean?  I'll never know.  You know what cartoon I used to hate when I was a kid? 
[02:38:00]  Fat Albert and the Cosby kids.  It's like the most racist, racist, most degrading cartoon in the history of television.  I actually had a guy walking around with a damn hat pulled over his head.  And another guy going,  We were going to Jesus.  My name is the Bill.  It's like,  Hey, hey, hey, I'm illiterate. 
[02:38:30]  Egg.  Rinse.  Hi, my name is Debbie Ellis.  Can I help you?  Yes, I'm looking to fill a permanent position.  Certainly.  Now, what kind of position are you looking to fill?  I'm looking to fill doggy style is the position.  What is that?  Doggy style.  I beg your pardon? 
[02:39:00]  Doggy style.  Which means?  Which means, you know, in the rear.  Log on.  Listen up.  XM introduces its premium online music service.  XM Radio Online.

[02:40:30]  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in the microwave.  And then have her roll around in that screaming donkey sausage donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Do Jimmy Dean's donkey sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.

I'm shooting afric.  I see that.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I want to see if Chad is still snoring away in Sacramento. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  He's been on hold for almost three hours, Anthony.  All right.  He wanted to tell Jim Norton about a massage parlor in Sacramento when Jim Norton plays Sacramento  next weekend.  Yes.  A week from this weekend or whatever.  And this is Chad.  If you listen really closely, you can hear him just snoring away.  Chad!  Yo, Chad, you're on the radio. 
[02:42:00]  He's still snoring.  He's still snoring.  Wow.  And being the good guys we are, we're just keeping him on hold so he has a really bad phone bill.  There you go.  Anthony, do me a favor.  On this show, at least call me Rico.  Rico.  My own goddamn house.  Frenchie's on the line, Anthony.  He has a problem with one of the members of the O.B. and Anthony program.  This is the old Frenchie, Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, Frenchie.  What's going on?  Hello, guys.  How are you?  I have a little problem with Martini Steve.  Oh, he's got a problem with Martini Steve. 
[02:42:30]  Where is that?  Oh, here he is.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Martini Steve is.  Oh, I need a little volume.  Oh, sorry about that.  There he comes.  Martini Steve.  All right.  Martini Steve's in the studio.  Steve, because I know how you could get.  At least let Frenchie talk for a few seconds.  I want to see why he has a problem with you before you absolutely lose your mind.  Yeah, I can't figure out why he would have a problem with Steve.  Why?  I don't think there's much interaction there.  But let's hear.  Frenchie, what's your problem with our own Martini Steve? 
[02:43:00]  Where does he get his clothes?  His what?  His clothes?  What he wears.  Clothes?  His clothes?  Yes.  His clothes.  Oh, my clothes.  Yes, you look like a fucking fag, man.  Why have you chosen to kill yourself this morning?  Because you will not be living five minutes past these comments.  Leave your mouth.  But listen, where did you get this fashion?  Do you like to hang out in?  Is he in the building?  Because if I find out, dude, I'm not in the mood to be fucked with this morning, really. 
[02:43:30]  Really?  Why?  Well, let's hear what Frenchie has to say, Steve.  No, let's not.  Let's find him and kick his teeth down his throat.  Frenchie, what's wrong with Steve's clothes?  Yeah.  I think that I know why he gets his horrible clothes, because he likes to hang out in truck  stops.  Yeah.  I fully admit that I brought the shirt I'm wearing in a truck stop, you fucking retard.  You like it, huh?  When a bunch of big black people get there and get you in the ass?  Dude. 
[02:44:00]  And get you flopped, you fat ass?  You're like flailing.  Oh, you suck.  You know what, dude?  Not the right morning.  They make the thing you want to have to go to the bathroom, you bitch.  What?  Oh, jeez.  Wait, what did he say?  They make you drink the water from the bathroom while you get ass raped by a bunch of goons.  What's his problem?  First of all, there's not a lot of black people in the truck stops, and not a lot of goons.  No?  No.  Well, how about those bunch of rednecks from, you know, Texas or from down Louisiana, you 
[02:44:30]  know, when they speak at a refrain, they say, who's your daddy, huh?  Huh?  Who's your daddy, you big bitch?  What?  Why do you have a problem with Martin Easton?  I can only assume that he has been diagnosed with some crippling, debilitating illness,  and he's looking to euthanize himself as quickly as humanly possible, because this son of a  bitch is looking to get the shit kicked out of him.  That's not going to happen.  Dude, have you, have, I've stood in the room next to you, you are as nice as can possibly  be.  On the other end of the phone, you grow a big, hairy sack? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, because Frenchie is the biggest wimp in person.  Yeah.  The biggest wimp.  But I'm a nice person.  Yeah, you're very nice to me, and you've invited me to your restaurant a number of times.  Having said what you have just said this morning, if I see you again, I'm knocking your teeth  out.  Yeah, Frenchie, you're not going to be able to ever come by and say hi to you.  I know, he'll kill you.  You understand that, right?  Because Steve isn't messing around.  I was just doing what I was supposed to do.  Yeah, but there's no reason to call here and bother Steve about his Harvey Firestein wardrobe. 
[02:45:30]  Thank you.  There was a good reason behind it.  Horrible clothes.  Frenchie, who called you this morning and told you to fuck with me?  Your little girlfriend next to you, Ben.  Yeah, of course.  Wait, Ben's involved with this?  Of course.  Frenchie has never had a problem with me in the past.  I can only assume King Instigator had something to do with this.  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  He's afraid.  He really thinks he's going to get his ass kicked.  Stop it!  Why are you keeping in my pants? 
[02:46:00]  Stop whining.  All right, hold on.  Okay, I'm surrendering.  I'm surrendering.  All right, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  All right, Max the trucker is on the line.  He has a problem with Frenchie.  Go ahead.  Yeah, this is Max the pissed off truck driver.  I want to fucking zip tie this asshole to the grill on my freight liner, drive down the road,  and use him as my personal bug shield.  Why don't you come by me and I make you my little bitch, you fuck sucker.  Yeah, come by with you big truck. 
[02:46:30]  My sister-in-law's got a couple of poodles.  I put you under the hood and I peep on you, you fuck.  Here's your queer you stupid bitch  Yeah, I love it. I love it. You know, oh, and I love seeing these old World War 2 movies  Go back into your own cross brand. You're fucking blowing up everything. Why are you driving right now?  In fucking texas. Why don't you drive on the road?  Get my house. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm right now. This is awful.  Why don't you next time you see a deer, I want you to hit it, you fuck. 
[02:47:00]  You stupid dick.  He's trying too hard.  Max or Frenchy?  Yeah, Frenchy.  What?  I don't know, man. I don't know what's happening with you.  You seem to be trying a little too hard.  No, I'm not trying that hard at all.  And now Ben is setting up bits for you. What's going on?  It doesn't seem to be natural.  He called me all upset that he was off the show.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So what, you decided to... 
[02:47:30]  No, I just said to text Steve. That would be funny.  I didn't think Steve would threaten to kill him.  I didn't think Steve would threaten to kill him.  No, Steve will now kill him.  You sink my teeth into my throat? That's nice. Thank you.  All right.  Henri.  The real Frenchy is here, yes.  This stupid asshole.  She...  Why you talk to this jerk off anymore?  Huh?  Listen, you fucking Italian asshole.  Come on the phone.  Go back.  I want to come back on the show.  I was beaten the other day.  And shut the fuck up.  Like...  Like a long time ago.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:48:00]  People stomp over me.  I waved the white flag cause I'm a little faggot.  What kind of French accent do you have?  You fucking douchebag.  You are done.  You are done.  No, you're done.  You are not allowed to call the show anymore, you little faggot.  Put the fucking accent, you dick.  You have a white flag stuck in your ass, you dick.  You dick.  Goddammit, shut the head up, man.  There's a white flag sticking out of your ass.  Yeah, well, you're gonna have a black flag sticking up, you fucking ass.  You got back at the Marian comebacks, where it just repeats what you said. 
[02:48:30]  That's awful.  There's nothing to say.  See?  Shut the fuck up, man.  There's nothing to say you bust on Steve.  Steve's gonna throat fuck you, then kill you.  No, you're gonna come over your house and it's gonna make you use flames on his dick.  He's gonna put flames on his dick.  You know what the fuck?  Let your mother's ass, you dickbag.  I've proven my point.  I have to go fuck Frenchie's girlfriend.  Goodbye, guys.  Wow.  Henry.  You can come by anytime and guess what?  You wouldn't even last five fucking minutes.  See?  That's why we like the new Frenchie.  He knows when to get out. 
[02:49:00]  He got his lines in.  He punches out.  He had a couple good ones and he was gone.  What a fucking asshole.  This guy is fucking Italian on top of it.  We might have to have the two Frenchies go at it.  Wow.  He's a dick, man.  He's not even French.  I fucking hate that dick.  Well.  Alright, Frenchie.  I don't know.  Alright, I surrender.  This is it.  Well, no.  Even the surrendering, I think...  Yeah, that's...  That's even getting old.  I hate to do this, but...  Oh, he hung up on himself.  Oh, no.  I think Frenchie, it's... 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, he hung up, didn't he?  It's okay.  You can still tell him.  He's listening.  I just don't think it's working out anymore.  I think, you know, you had your day in the sun over two years ago.  It's like you're breaking up with a chick.  It was big.  It was good.  The people seemed to enjoy it.  Yeah.  They seemed to like the Frenchie character on the Opie and Anthony program before we  got the boot.  But something about now, when we're back, the new environment, the two years off, kind 
[02:50:00]  of a different feel to the show a little bit, and I don't think the Frenchie character  of old is really fitting in.  Not to mention you have no new material whatsoever to the limited supply you had in the first place.  So it might just be time, Frenchie, to turn around...  And say, au revoir.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  And walk away.  Just walk away. 
[02:50:30]  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  Au revoir, Frenchie.  Into the setting sun.  Ho, ho, ho, Frenchie.  Ho, ho.  Au revoir, Frenchie.  There he goes.  And there he's...  Walking off.  Walking away with his head down.  Head down.  Beret tilted forward on his head.  Big French bread and a paper bag in his arm.  There he goes.  Wearing his striped shirt. 
[02:51:00]  Little kidnapped child on the back of the bike.  All right.  A Nazi invading his house.  That was a good call though.  It had all the humor of the battle of the sexes.  Woo-hoo.

[03:13:30]  i gotta tell ya  i pretty much am  i'm into some pretty geeky stuff  but  after reading this list  i'm all man  there is some real geeky stuff over here  well there's a couple things on here  that i think we all do  and there are some things i have never ever ever done  no  we'll run through this  don't worry  we won't make this into a  a 40 minute bit like we usually do  no  we don't even have 40 minutes do we  oh yeah we do  uh yeah  so if we slow down here  well let's talk about 
[03:14:00]  this geeky hobby  top 10  i like how they listed these  they gave a percent  for each one of these geeky hobbies  one is for public humiliation  100% being i guess the worst possible public humiliation  that this hobby could give you  but i don't get the public humiliation on some of these things  because  you know like 
[03:14:30]  alright number 10 is comic books  comic books  as a geeky hobby  so where's the public humiliation  you're not walking around with your comic books  oh yes you are  you're at comic book shows  you're at events  you're  you may be in comic book stores  you're walking out of comic book stores  but you're in  in there with the rest of your  you have to leave the store at some point  so you're walking out of the place  with a big bag full of comic books  believe me there is plenty of embarrassing public humiliation moments  if you are a comic book enthusiast  you're trying to get some ass 
[03:15:00]  to talking to a girl  and you actually slip  that the artist in the fantastic four changed recently  right  i don't think you're understanding this  you're also discussing comic books at parties  this is why it's public humiliation  not just owning comic books  alright  the recent rash of comic book movies  comic book movies  you could talk to people about how the movie doesn't match the comic book  and how there's discrepancies  so there's plenty of public humiliation  girls going down on you  you feel yourself getting close  you go  oh  hulk coming  ten 
[03:15:30]  geekiest hobbies  number ten is comic books  public humiliation  forty nine percent  forty nine percent  our studies show that comic book geeks are normally solitary  but engage in very noisy arguments when gathered in numbers  oh yeah  okay there it is  oh and who would win in fights and stuff  yep  these are usually based on the most recent superhero movie  and how much it sucked  yeah the comic book people hate the comic book movies  for some reason  not all of them  not all of them  this sucking  what do they think about spider-man  great movie  spider-man 2 
[03:16:00]  great movie  hulk  shitty movie  hulk blue  i thought it was okay  i didn't hate it  what about daredevil  middle of the road  you either like it or you hate it  catwoman  sucked ass  yeah  yeah  do you hear that big argument people were having though  like who would win  the x-men or robert reed  with a cut on his finger  you are so obsessed with robert reed  wolverine takes a swipe at him  all of a sudden his t-cell count just plummets  claws fall off  this sucking is always measured in direct relation to the number of continuity problems between it and an issue of the incredible hulk 
[03:16:30]  there you go  which to be honest had some problems of its own  like the abrams tank with the completely wrong size smoothbore turret and the hulk's hair  just all of a sudden being part of the other way  who cares  now the biggest thing about the hulk movie was how his pants stayed on when he grew to huge size  yeah you think his penis would also grow in the  hulk-like schlong  there you go  damage to sex life  here's the other percent figure they give 
[03:17:00]  damage to sex life  100% would mean  you just are never ever getting a girl because of this hobby  okay  damage to sex life  68% anthony  yeah  when you're finished showing someone your chart of all the ways  magneto's hat in x-men 2  magneto  whatever  thank god  magneto  that means i'm not a geek  that means i'm not a geek  magneto's  whatever  if i may be so  magneto's hat in x-men 2  was incorrect  it's going to be a long uphill battle to then have sex with them  right  and to make matters worse 
[03:17:30]  the faulty shape of the dong port  in the movie's version of magneto's hat  will make having sex with it even harder  what's it say about spader man  spader man  whatever  who the hell  who cares  well  geeks  geeks  and that's what it is  so it's a list  that's just it  people don't care  except for comic book  alright so in 10th place  it's comic books anthony  geekiest hobbies of  of the current  pop culture i guess 
[03:18:00]  number 9 is role playing games  role playing games  ugh  dungeons and dragons  things like that  public  public humiliation  63%  dungeons and dragons  combines the nerdiness  of a fantasy setting  with the fruitlessness  of improvisational theater  just awful  and as if it weren't enough  for them to deal with  the rest of us  think  these people  are going to go crazy  and kill us  it's real hard for society  to do more  to tell you  that if you play this game 
[03:18:30]  you're on your own  and damage to sex life  78%  these people are not  getting laid  are they the ones  that are like  I'm the dark master  yeah they live their life  as a character  in the game  dungeons and dragons  which I admit  I tried playing  once  when I was a kid  once  and someone  you know  you roll this dice  and  yeah huh  you roll the dice  and someone says  oh  well now you're battling  a dragon  and your sword 
[03:19:00]  is there  and you're hitting him  it's like  well who are you  to say what's happening  I want a game  with a monitor  and keys  and a mouse  I don't want this nerd  telling me what I'm doing  that would be the dungeon master  the dungeon master  Opie  that's right  what  the dungeon master  kind of tells you  what's happening  and he's the big guy  speaking of which  you know  Stephen Lynch has a song  about D&D  yes he does  this would be a great  radio seg right here  okay  I'm gonna get back up here  this is a song  about a guy 
[03:19:30]  you might remember  from high school  or he might be  this guy  from high school  I don't know  my little harmonica  I got my 12-sided die  and I'm ready to roll  with the wizard  and my goblin crew  my friends are coming over  to my mom's basement 
[03:20:00]  bringing Funyuns  and the Mountain Dew  I got a big broad sword  made out of cardboard  and that stereo's  a-pumpin' Zeppelin  it's that time of the night  we turn on the black light  let the dungeons  and the dragons begin  it's D&D  fighting with the legends  of yore  it's D&D  never kissed a lady before  no  now the lord of the rings 
[03:20:30]  the dark crystal  we use these as a reference tool  and when we put on our cloaks  and tell warlock jokes  we're the coolest kids  at the school  no we're not  I know  now Tag's a real bastard  but a fair dungeon master 
[03:21:00]  he's got hit points  and charisma to lend  and I rehearse in my room  for what I call  the dragons tune  when I'm out  with my girlfriend  it's D&D  wait  sorry  you got a girlfriend?  yeah  yeah I gotta  no  it's D&D  warriors that terrify  it's D&D  virgins 
[03:21:30]  till the day  we  1, 2, 3, 4, 10  right on 
[03:22:00]  Stephen Lynch  with his buddy  He looks like a little angel.  Oh, he can sing, man.  That's off his CD superhero, his Dungeons & Dragons song,  which is part of the role-playing games, I guess, Anthony,  which is the No. 9 geekiest hobby.  By the way, I'm not gay at all,  but I have thought of just laying around with Lynch,  both of us shirtless and him crooning a little tune into my ear.  That guy's got a voice, man.  All right.  In the eighth position, Anthony, it's scrapbooking.  Scrapbooking.  Here's another thing that I have no clue about,  but apparently people like doing this, 
[03:22:30]  public humiliation, 86%.  I think my sister does a scrapbooking down there in Orlando.  Really?  These are people that like clipping things out.  It's not good enough to just put your pictures in a book.  You have to put the little pretty clouds and hearts.  It involves glue guns, glitter, construction paper, scissors.  I'm going to throw a monkey wrench into this, though.  Scrapbooking is not geeky if you're murdering people  and then cutting out the clippings.  It's very acceptable.  Oh, the newspaper?  Absolutely.  Not geeky at all.  That's true.  That's pretty cool. 
[03:23:00]  It's not geeky if you're collecting trophies.  Right.  If you have a clipping and pubic hair from the person in the photo,  not geeky.  Mm-hmm.  So you kind of like decorate your photo album with structure paper and stuff.  Yeah, but it could also not be your photos.  It could be other things that you just scrapbook.  Perhaps you like dogs.  You would go through magazines and clip pictures of dogs out and arrange them and maybe make  a little dog.  You'd go to the craft shop and buy some funny little plastic eyes.  No, no, no. 
[03:23:30]  They arrange parties and people come to the house prepared with all of the items to host.  Oh.  And then the girls sit around and scrapbook all day.  Popsicle sticks and the girls scrapbook all day.  And they wonder why they got to put PSAs out for punching them in the face.  I was going to say, and they wonder why their husbands are at the strip clubs getting lap  dances and glitter on their face.  What else do you do after you scrapbook the dog pictures?  Do you buy the 50-pound radio and listen to it and look at the little dog that comes  with it? 
[03:24:00]  Awful.  Scrapbooking, public humiliation, 86%.  Oh, my God.  Damage to sex life.  They don't even have a damage number here.  It's too high.  Because they're not having sex because their husbands are at the strip clubs getting blow  jobs in the champagne room.  What?  That doesn't happen, right?  No, never.  Of course.  Number seven.  Well, Pete from Brooklyn wants to defend D&D players.  Pete, real fast.  Stop it.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  I played since I was like 14.  I stopped when I was like 21.  Oh, wait.  You can't defend, Pete.  You've been frozen by a mysterious freeze spell that has been cast upon you, so now you can't 
[03:24:30]  even defend yourself.  Oh, well.  Sorry.  There you go.  I would have liked to have had him defend himself, but I rolled the dice and a big freeze spell  I was able to cast on you.  You know a little too much about the game.  No, I know from EverQuest.  I'm just going with it.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Too bad he didn't have a saving throw versus him.  I know.  Okay, let's move on with this stupid list.  The ten geekiest hobbies in the seventh position, it's just Star Wars in general, Anthony.  I think Star Wars is a hobby to a lot of people. 
[03:25:00]  It's a way of life.  Public humiliation, 82%, but you know, I think that's a little high because everyone goes  to see these movies, except Jim Norton.  Do you go see them?  No, because I like the originals.  I thought, please, the first two were great.  Even part three I enjoyed.  But the characters, I always hated the cantina scene with the fucking elephant in his rubber  arms.  Stop with the marketing.  I don't like those either.  I don't like that scene.  The first one was get away with the bull, but the second one, pretty bad.  We're not talking about the Ewoks in part three. 
[03:25:30]  I hate Ewoks in any way, shape, or form.  But we're not talking about the movies themselves.  It's the people that just live their lives as Star Wars characters.  And they meet at these conventions, and they dress up like Darth Vader.  We saw some people dressed as Stormtroopers.  Stormtroopers.  We lived this thing.  TIE fighter pilots and X-Wing pilots.  Very recently, yeah.  Conventions like Wizard World Dallas, November 5th through 7th, Arlington Convention Center,  Texas.  Oh my God.  You're going to one of these things? 
[03:26:00]  I am, and I'll have WoW stickers with me and everything.  And there'll be a lot of Star Wars people there.  And Jim, it's part six, not part three.  Which one?  Are you going to dress up as a Star Wars character?  I am not dressing as a Star Wars character.  The Death Star?  Not as a Star Wars character.  Jabba?  Oh, jeez.  Jabba was mean.  The Death Star was kind of humorous and silly.  I know, it was too easy.  Silly?  I do apologize.  Laid waste to a couple of planets.  I try to be a little more clever with my lines.  I don't try to go with the obvious. 
[03:26:30]  Death Star wasn't very obvious.  Peter Cushing?  There you go.  Damage to sex life, 54%.  Yep, yep, yep.  Yeah, but you could find a lot of girls that are into Star Wars, though, too, which is weird.  Hey, what's big girls with bread on their head?  Yeah.  What's the damage to our radio show for reading this list?  Pretty geeky.  Okay.  Pretty geeky.  In the sixth position, we're talking about the geekiest hobbies out there right now.  This is the lamest thing I've seen.  Absolutely. 
[03:27:00]  It comes in close with the role-playing thing, but...  It's vampirism.  Vampirism.  These are these ex-club kids.  They would have been club kids back in the 80s, and now they're goth, and they walk around thinking they're vampires.  They dress all goth.  They have fangs that they go to the dentist and have these fangs put in.  So they're walking around with fangs.  They have the dark makeup under their eyes and the pancake makeup all over their face,  and they walk around actually believing that they're vampires, sucking blood from each other. 
[03:27:30]  They bleed each other.  And I do believe they say this a lot.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  I want to suck your blood.  They're trying to be dark and mysterious, so you go, hey, what's going on with that guy?  But I'm telling you, that whole movement, ever since the guy that started it, Robert Reed...  Jesus, back to Robert Reed.  Public humiliation, 90% on this one, because you just walk around and people just look at you like you are an ass. 
[03:28:00]  And you can see hundreds of them at the Chiller Theater Convention this weekend, October 29th through 31st.  East Rutherford, New Jersey, Sheridan, Meadowlands.  All right, moving on with the geekiest hobbies.  What nerds.  In the fifth position, Anthony, it's collecting cards.  Collectible card games.  I'm not really into this, but I know a few of these games.  They're actually games that you play with cards.  Like the Pokemon cards.  That are based on, yeah.  Or Uno.  That was a fun game.  Remember Uno?  No, no, no.  I don't think Uno is actually...  Go fish! 
[03:28:30]  That wasn't a collectible card game.  A high of 96% public humiliation.  Yeah, yeah.  Number four, this is something I can relate to.  I've been totally entrenched in this for many, many years now.  EverQuest.  Yeah, and I do believe this was the downfall of the last version of the Opie and Anthony show.  I believe that Anthony was playing EverQuest too many hours, and he was sleep-deprived.  And when it came to taking that phone call at St. Pat's Cathedral, he was thinking about his little guild instead of our fine radio careers. 
[03:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You were in deep.  You were in deep with the EverQuest.  EverQuest to blame.  EverQuest has been blamed for many, many things, and it's rightly so.  A lot of people have lost jobs, wives, families over EverQuest.  Ben Stein.  Remember Ben Stein?  Win Ben Stein's money?  I'm Ben Stein.  And I'm an asshole.  He is quite the dick.  His son used to play EverQuest and had to go to a rehab clinic. 
[03:29:30]  He sent his son to EverQuest rehab because his son was addicted.  He would wake up at 3 in the morning, and his son would be playing EverQuest, missing school, and it was an addiction.  And then Ben Stein came out against EverQuest.  Uh, public humiliation, 70%.  You know, unless you're talking to other EverQuest people, I'm a level 65 shaman.  Ooh.  Uh, Opie, yes.  Is it still popular?  Do people still play it?  It's huge.  It's still huge online games. 
[03:30:00]  It's one of the hugest online games.  It's irresponsible.  Hundreds of thousands of people playing this.  It's irresponsible to get addicted to a game that you could easily manipulate to play itself.  Mm-hmm.  Like Star Wars Galaxies and those other type of games.  Oh, yeah.  They're role-playing games.  You get on it.  They're good graphics, fun to play.  And Damage to Sex Life, 99.8%.  This is, they call it the Widowmaker, because people play this, they get so entrenched in it that you just forget about your wife or girlfriend. 
[03:30:30]  What's the most hours you've spent playing, would you say?  Oh, my God.  They have a feature in the game where they keep track of the hours.  You can keep track of the actual time you spend playing the game, not how long you've been a member of the game.  But the actual game play time, I was up to, I think, nine months.  Oh, my God.  This is nine months of my lifespan.  Real time.  Real time.  Keith the Cop is over that.  He's into the years.  He spent years of his life doing this.  Wow.  Yeah.  The longest I've ever spent at one clip playing, over 24 hours. 
[03:31:00]  Straight?  Straight.  Straight.  Non-stop, 24 hours, sitting there, like, falling asleep on a raid.  You just don't know the time is going by.  You absolutely don't.  Yes, you do.  No.  Isn't it true that you could just spend hours just making, like, stupid arrows and things like that?  There are things that, yes, you would spend time making those.  But most people spend a lot of the time on the raids.  You know, you go on raids with, you know, 50, 75 other people.  And you've got to take down a big dragon. 
[03:31:30]  And all these people are at the computers at home.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to take down a big dragon.  It takes a long time to set up a raid with that many people.  You know, you've got to get organized, get places.  Hours.  You cast your various spells on people.  And then you go in and go get them.  And then there's resurrecting people that have been killed in battle.  Like, will you tell someone, hey, you take the arrows and I'll go for the dragon this way?  Everyone has their role.  And if you're on a raid, you pretty much know what your role is when you go into it.  You don't have to tell everybody.  Yeah.  Other people just keep the other guys what they call buffed with spells that make you stronger. 
[03:32:00]  And then other people will do the damage.  And other people sit back and do the healing.  You know, they all know what their roles are.  And does each player have, like, someone holding their head?  Baw!  Baw!  How many arrows?  Baw!  Baw!  Baw!  That's awful.  Very entertaining game.  All right.  In the third position.  And EverQuest 2 coming out very soon, which I will be back into.  Okay.  Third position for the geekiest hobbies.  We're talking about the Trekkies, Anthony. 
[03:32:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Star Trek.  Star Trek is in the third position.  Geekiest hobbies.  These, I think this should have actually been number one because no one is as geeky as a  Star Trek geek.  When you see people at these conventions gathered around speaking Klingonese.  They don't do that.  Yeah.  It is the worst.  And as a matter of fact, I have seen a videotape of Big Kev when he went to, where was it?  That would be Universal Studios.  Universal Studios.  He was part of this big extravaganza where they dressed him up like a Klingon and there 
[03:33:00]  were other guests of Universal Studios and they do a movie of you and he was playing  a Klingon and he was dressed as a Klingon, speaking Klingonese.  It is worse than watching Tony Danza.  Can we get the audio of that?  Oh, absolutely.  How does a Klingon speak if I could hear that?  What's your line?  What's your line?  Give us some Klingonese.  I don't know any Klingonese.  Come on.  You do too.  Give us some Klingonese.  Give us the line from your movie.  I don't know the line from the movie, but I do know one line.  All right.  What is it? 
[03:33:30]  I can't do it.  Come on.  Yes, you can.  Nook dach lech de poch.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's just looking away.  I already know.  Everyone's just looking away.  I do know what it means.  It means I never get pussy and I should be shot.  Isn't that Bemis up?  No.  What is it?  Where's the chocolate?  Oh, my God.  Public humiliation, 86%.  And in this studio, 100%. 
[03:34:00]  Can you give us another line, please?  How does that go again?  How does that go again?  That's the only line you know?  That's the only line.  Give it to us again.  Nu tach lech de poch.  Oy vey.  Wow.  That makes the back of my neck hair scared.  Yeah.  Mine too.  Horrid.  That's worse than Ashley Simpson doing the Irish jig, I think.  Wow.  Nu tach lech.  Ugh.  Ugh.  All right.  And distinguishing characteristics of a Star Trek fanatic, if someone approaches you and  they're more machine than man and threatening to assimilate you, it's either a Star Trek 
[03:34:30]  enthusiast or an android lost in time.  Either way, it's your duty as a human to smash it.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Number two, furries slash plushies.  Yeah, man.  This website's dedicated to this thing.  Yeah, I've heard about...  These are people, the furries are people who dress like animals to have sex with each  other, usually without regard for gender of their mate or the species of their costume.  A little pig mask because you're giving head to a guy in a hotel?  No, dude, dude.  Daddy!  No, no, no. 
[03:35:00]  They dress up like...  No, no.  That would be almost normal.  They dress up like full stuffed animals.  Like Care Bears and things like that, like plushy bunnies, and then they have sex with  each other.  You know the people that get the surgery?  Are they like, you know the people that get the surgery and actually have whiskers put  on them?  Oh, I've seen that.  Those assholes.  No, that's not...  They like being live action plush toys.  All right.  Yeah, here's the deal.  So the furries are people that dress up like stuffed animals and have sex with each other,  okay?  And the plushies, it's a similar hobby, but instead of having sex with nerds dressed as 
[03:35:30]  animals, they consummate the relationships with their own stuffed animals.  Yeah, they have sex with stuffed animals.  They put them between their legs and push and squeeze and have sex with...  We're going to have to get some links to these websites up on foundrymusic.com.  There's a lot of them out there.  Or opianthony.com.  That doesn't represent childhood abuse, you know, when you have a little furry animal  between your legs and your tear-stricken face is in your pillow and you're humping it until  you make a little mess.  That has to be the creepiest hobby of all time, not the geekiest. 
[03:36:00]  Damage to sex life is actually a negative number in this.  Negative nine.  How could it be damage to sex life if they're having sex, though?  Well, I think they damage to sex life with human beings.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because it's over.  If you're screwing your stuffed animals, it is over.  Oh, my God.  You'll know furries and plushies because they'll either be wearing a crotchless panda  suit or just a screaming teddy bear firmly against their crotch. 
[03:36:30]  A crotchless panda suit.  Oh, my God.  And we thought Jimmy Norton had problems.  Suddenly sounds hot.  There are people that the government should just guess.  Mm-hmm.  What do you like to do?  Put on a panda suit and cut out the crotch and get fucked?  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Tigger, would you do me from behind, please?  Just as Winnie the Pooh.  I'll take it in the ass, please, piglet. 
[03:37:00]  That's the only time I encourage that is if you put on a Tigger outfit and grab a young  tit in Disney.  That's kind of acceptable.  I'd give you a handy, but I only have three fingers.  I am a kid toucher.  Gak, gak, gak, gak.  Number one.  Yeah.  This is really bad.  This is the geekiest hobby.  Live action role playing or LARPing.  LARPing.  LARP.  But isn't this like role playing games? 
[03:37:30]  It's like Dungeons and Dragons.  It's like role playing games, except we stand up and you actually, not we, because I don't  know.  We.  And you speak Klingon.  This is like Dungeons and Dragons, which you would play in the basement with your dice and  the dungeon master and a board and various other accoutrements.  But the live action, Opie, you actually act it out.  You wear the costumes, you wear the armor, the sword, and you have the battles in real  life.  Is this like the Civil War crap? 
[03:38:00]  No, no, no, no.  No, that's like kind of normal stuff.  When you.  Civil War thing is actually respectable.  Here.  Reenact the battles of the Civil War.  This is in this.  Here it is.  It's it's they wrap it up like this.  It's like a renaissance fair and backyard wrestling wrapped up into one.  Swords made of PVC covered with pipe insulation so you can actually beat each other with them.  Oh, yeah.  Big Kev, have you done this?  I have not done this. 
[03:38:30]  I've seen it done, but I haven't done it.  So it's just live action like Dungeons and Dragons in a field or something?  Basically, yes.  Where have you seen it done?  How do these idiots communicate?  They set up a site like we'll meet at the field and you come in your costume.  You often see a lot of them at, you know, these type of.  Ugh.  Awful expos.  At the expos and shows and stuff like that.  So that.  Yeah, I think I guess that is number one.  That's really bad.  They left the best one off the list.  If your kid's doing this, it's over.  Just just kill your kid if they're doing this. 
[03:39:00]  You should be happier if he's wearing a black trench coat and celebrating Hitler's birthday in Colorado.  That should make you proud of your son.  April 20th.  Is that Hitler's birthday?  Oh.  Little known fact, yeah.  What was the one they left off the list?  Collecting toys.  They left the best one off the list.  Well, that's what you do, you geek.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, Scott Peterson.  Happy birthday to you.  We missed his birthday.  When? 
[03:39:30]  It was Sunday.  He's 30 years old.  He said what he wanted for his birthday, I think, was concrete and some chains.  And he said, ah, I got that already.  So hard to shop for.  Don't need those children's clothes.  Hey, are we getting Eric Logan on the line?  He's in a meeting.  He's in another meeting.  Don't need the little Connor license plate for the back of the bicycle.  What is he in a meeting for?  Trying to get new buckets? 
[03:40:00]  Are we trying to get Eric Logan on the show?  Did we turn him off to our program?  He knows we're trying to reach him.  We have a huge XM announcement today.  We're all going to the press conference at 1 o'clock.  He needed to get the official press release.  Where is this press conference?  At the marquee?  Dude, we don't have that.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, yeah.  Ben's all panicking.  Like, yeah, there's just going to be thousands of O&A fans running to the marquee now.  It's not the marquee.  Get it straight.  It's marquee.  That's why I'm asking you.  Where is it?  It's the marquee.  It's marquee.  Marquee. 
[03:40:30]  Marquee.  Marquee.  By the way, we're going to get you the Grand Theft Auto games between 3 and 4 o'clock.  What?  What?  Really?  3 and 4 o'clock.  Oh, I only have to hang out in the city until 3 or 4?  Like, under lock and key for some reason.  Yeah, everyone is playing it all over the country, and we don't have our copy.  And we're in the stupid game doing a little camo.  Oh, my God.  Here's some of the guys that actually are in the game that are going to get a copy.  They can't even get enough copies to the people that are in the game.  You get two copies, one for each of you.  We got to get this video of these LARPing, these kids doing the live-action role-playing. 
[03:41:00]  Someone just sent me a video clip.  Oh, it is so embarrassing.  I can't even watch it.  Hit a play.  Look at some of this.  Explain what's going on.  I can't see it.  They're in the backyard.  One guy is dressed up as a huge knight, and he's approaching this other guy, and he just slashed him, and he went down.  Now three more are bashing the knight with their swords and sticks, and oh, my goodness.  Wow.  They're fighting.  They're actually doing, like, this sword fighting thing badly with bad props. 
[03:41:30]  Do you know what LARPing video I saw that I thought was really funny?  It was when the guy dressed up like a truck driver, and then a bunch of other people dressed up like savages and beat him in the street and hit him with a toilet seat.  That was a fun little LARP.  That was the latest version of Grand Theft Auto.  San Andreas.  What is this about?  Or an Abner Louieman dressed up like a popsicle stick.  God, Jesus.  That was a great one.  Tip from Philly.  What's up?  Hey.  Your last break, I switched over to CNBC, and they had an XM commercial for you guys on there. 
[03:42:00]  It said, catch the O&A virus, had some clips.  About a 15-second spot.  You kidding?  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  They're doing some advertising?  Stop.  Are they actually throwing us a little bone?  No way.  Oof.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Tim.  All right, cool.  I want to go LARPing, guys.  Let's go LARPing.  You know, my friend Lacey used to like to LARP.  She used to like to pretend she was an anchor.  All right, we have to give up on the Chad bit. 
[03:42:30]  Now it's just his phone's battery going dead.  So after three and a half hours, we've got to say goodbye to Chad in Sacramento.  Thanks for calling the program, Chad.  Lacey away, old chum.  Lacey away.  Popeye with his tattoo of Lacey on his arm. 
[03:43:00]  Well, funny thing, we need one big coffin and one little one.  You are out of your mind.  Why?  We have a little satin pillow.  Let's take a break.  Jesus.

It's not that I don't like him  Downhill with Bush 
[03:55:00]  You're talking about the Playboy thing?  Or are you talking about  Or the fact that all the girls today are now sporting wood floors?  Right  Down with Bush  Down with Bush  Yeah  What?
