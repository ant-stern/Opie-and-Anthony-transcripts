<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts brainstorming a new segment to find a replacement for their "Friday guy," soliciting comedic audio clips from listeners.  This led to a nostalgic discussion about a past contest, "Most Annoying 30 Seconds,"  recalling the sheer volume of entries and their hilarious, yet fruitless, judging efforts, including a long car ride dedicated to listening to the submissions.  They briefly touched upon other failed contests, citing lack of prizes or structure as contributing factors, and mentioned forthcoming announcements for previous winners.

The conversation then shifted to a picture of President Obama working out, sparking a discussion about Obama's declared White Sox fandom, contrasted with Hillary Clinton's perceived lack of strong allegiance to any sports team.  This segued into one host's new rifle purchase, a DEA-model firearm, and their experiences at the shooting range.  A short discussion followed about hunting and the emotional toll of killing animals, before returning briefly to listener feedback concerning Hillary Clinton's sports allegiances.

Next, the hosts reviewed a live video podcast by the "Chocolate Rain" singer, criticizing its poor quality and lack of engagement. A caller, Chris, then shared a story from a past "Homeless Roulette" segment, detailing a failed attempt to surreptitiously photograph a homeless person, which resulted in a chase. They noted the segment's cancellation due to weather and plans to revive it.  The hosts then announced that they were under orders to end the show promptly at 8:45, abandoning their usual practice of running overtime. They hinted at a controversial news story they planned to cover later in the broadcast and mentioned an upcoming interview with Maureen McCormick before concluding this portion of the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank God it's Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Wunderbar.  Where is our Friday guy?  We haven't played that in a while.  I haven't heard him in a while.  It's Friday.  In years.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday. 
[00:00:30]  You know what?  New bit.  I throw a lot of bits out there.  Some don't work.  A lot of them don't work.  I understand that.  Quantity.  You see what sticks.  Yeah, but every once in a while you get Radio Gold.  How about we look for the new Friday guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, listeners, you know.  You could, like, put a little Friday thing together.  Very dry.  Not a lot of production.  Just you acting like an idiot saying it's Friday.  All right. 
[00:01:00]  And then we could play them.  And then maybe one will stick and be the new Friday guy.  I bet it won't.  It's Friday.  You never know.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  This guy, maybe someone could help me.  He was a complete lunatic that used to call a radio station somewhere out west.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  And that area couldn't get enough of the guy.  And then they ended up bringing him in studio.  And I think he started having his own show.  But he was completely insane.  And it's very hard to find tapes of this guy.  Really?  Yeah.  That's all I know.  I didn't know who it was.  I don't know this man.  I don't know where he comes from.  Years ago, I had a couple shows that he was on.  And, wow, he would just spew the craziness.  Well, good morning. 
[00:02:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Danny, you want to take care of the Friday audio?  If people want to try to be the new Friday guy.  Sure.  That'll be.  That sounds like a really fun job for me.  That'll be exciting.  Doesn't that sound great?  Woo-hoo.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you guys remember that most annoying 30 seconds contest we did?  That was a lot of fun to be in charge of, too.  You know what, though?  That was a great contest.  Most annoying 30 seconds.  That was a great contest.  What a lame contest that was.  It wasn't lame.  The most annoying 30 seconds. 
[00:02:30]  I got to stick up for the most annoying 30 seconds.  Do we still have that disc of the most annoying 30 seconds?  I'm sure we could find it somewhere.  See, the brilliant thing about that was that you didn't need to be a professional to do that.  Anyone with a microphone and some kind of recording device could get in on this.  And that was the great thing.  So I just got bombarded with all these really great entries.  And it was just a treat to go through them all and listen to.  Well, the best part, we thought it would be really funny and stuff.  And then we started realizing, wait, we're actually turning off listeners because it's 
[00:03:00]  so annoying.  They can't even sit through it for the goof.  No, no.  You have to turn the radio off.  There was so much.  So many people had entered that specific contest that I didn't know how I was going to listen  to all these entries.  Yeah.  So I burned them to MP3.  I filled up like two CDs with just MP3s.  And I drove to Montauk and back listening to them.  Just listening to people making noises.  So for anybody out of town, that's a good two-hour drive there and then back. 
[00:03:30]  One of many contests that we just gave up on because it was just awful.  Well, if you have noticed, we have contests.  Yeah.  And they just end.  They go away.  They just fade away.  Yeah, because we never promise a prize or anything.  We just have people send stuff in.  We play it, and then it goes away.  For the really old listeners, next week, we're going to pick the WoW winner, finally.  That is the Naughty Nighty Contest winner, finally.  Yeah, yeah.  Things like that.  Was it Naughty Nighty that we never saw?  Yeah, I think.  Oh, I thought it was the WoW contest. 
[00:04:00]  Well, what was the most recent?  Pendulum.  Well, Pendulum.  Yeah, Pendulum.  It's like, oh, all right.  Well, it just kind of faded away.  Do we have other entries on the Pendulum Contest?  Yeah, I'm sure we do.  I got to go screen some more.  But that's how we roll.  We just kind of, hey, here's a contest.  Then we never announce a prize.  E-Rock, do you got a disc of the most annoying 30 seconds?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, because we'll play at least a few highlights from that wonderful idea we had.  I know Jimmy had a great one.  Yeah, with the...  That was a good one, but I remember there was also one that someone had produced where it 
[00:04:30]  was kind of like a...  That sound that Jim does was like some kind of nature call from some bird, and the guy  was...  That's what I mean, yeah.  Yeah, the guy was doing it as some kind of nature reporter.  It was actually quite funny.  Didn't they just start...  The meaty-breasted nothing.  The sounds of the meaty-breasted nothing in the wild.  When ended at that contest, didn't someone start messing with tones to the point where  it just hurts your ears, and we're like, oh my God, this is not right.  It was like it should have been used as one of those audio weapons that you hear about 
[00:05:00]  on Discovery or something, where it just is so annoying, you have to flee the area.  Where it keeps teenagers away from the drugstore because older people can't hear it.  Yeah, yeah, and all of a sudden, you'll just start feeling dizzy and nauseous.  All right, so we're going to have people try to become the new Friday guy, and hopefully  we'll have a...  Hopefully we'll...  Oh, you have one?  All right, E-Rock has one of the entries in the most annoying 30 seconds contest. 
[00:05:30]  I hope someone hit their snooze alarm at 6, but it's just going off now.  Here it is.  That was really annoying.  It was awful.  That's just a little taste.  That thing went on for a while.  Oh, a new sound slowly come into it, and it's really annoying. 
[00:06:00]  Remember one...  Oh, yes, Mr. Rock?  All right, one more.  One more example.  One more example.  In the most annoying 30 seconds contest.  I remember it was so terrible that, like, everything was getting pushed through to the 
[00:06:30]  next stage, because by a certain point, everything just becomes so obnoxious.  You get three seconds into any clip, and you're like, I don't want to hear this anymore.  Don't want to hear this.  That's wonderful.  All right, well, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Friday.  Got lots to do today.  877-212-ON-A.  Now, you see the picture of Obama looking all cool in the paper today? 
[00:07:00]  Going to the gym.  Got a young president.  Yeah, apparently we do, huh?  A nice young president.  I saw that.  I saw a montage of a bunch of shots that were taken over the course of the campaign.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he showed them when he was playing basketball and just kind of getting off the  plane with his family running towards him and doing things.  And, yeah, he's, you know, obviously a young guy.  They got a picture on the front page of one of the rags here in New York City. 
[00:07:30]  It says, one cool dude.  And what I like about him, he's a White Sox fan.  I don't like the White Sox, but I respect a guy that could make a decision on a dumb sports  team.  Most politicians can't.  Well, he's elected now, so.  No, he was wearing the White Sox thing.  Was he?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was.  I think he showed up in one of the playoff games with the White Sox hat.  I remember Hillary was pretty much changing hats depending on who was at Bath.  I mean, just make a decision.  I mean, people can respect that. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you know, she was.  You'll never hear anybody say, boy, that Hillary can sure stick to her guns.  She's what they call wishy-washy.  Yeah.  She waffles.  And I told Lana, between the radio show and planning for a wedding, I'm having a tough  time finding time to go to the gym.  And here's the guy.  He just became president, and they got a picture of him leaving the gym after a great  workout.  How does he find the time?  Great picture of the guys in the SUV, though.  That's my fave. 
[00:08:30]  The best job in America right there.  Oh, right there.  Where is that picture?  Yeah.  It's all over, though.  It's on Drudge.  It was.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's everywhere.  That guy is just.  I don't like guns.  Boy, for a guy who doesn't like guns, Obama sure has a few big ones.  Yeah.  Going with him everywhere.  Right in the back of the SUV, you just pop up that glass part where you usually  maybe some housewife is putting in the groceries.  Yeah, sure.  And, you know, you just hang out your barrel out of that and wait for some shenanigans.  That guy looks like he means business.  I just bought that same rifle. 
[00:09:00]  Young bald guy with the slick sunglasses.  And you got this rifle?  Yeah, I just bought that exact same one.  I did ask you in the office.  It's the DEA version.  I go to Ann, like, you see the picture of that gun.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Got it.  Not only is it cool, I got it.  Got him, got him, need him, got him, got him, need him, need him, got him, need him.  That's me.  No, Ann, why do you need a gun like that?  Because you know what a blast that is to shoot?  That is a fun gun.  Yeah.  It's very light.  It's nice. 
[00:09:30]  It's a lightweight one.  Because I have one of my heavy guns.  I have now a heavy gun and a light one.  The heavy one's got a fold-out bipod in the front and a cog sight.  It weighs.  It's got a sniper, a stock with, like, a cheek rest on it.  Right.  And, oh, it's fantastic.  That thing will, oof.  Yeah.  Oh, I got it.  I can't even take it to the indoor range.  I got to wait for nice weather and take it out to Calverton.  But I got that one.  It's nice and lightweight.  Now, what do you think of the people that would go into the forest and kill Bambi 
[00:10:00]  with this thing?  Yeah, whatever you're into.  You know, I'm not a hunter.  I don't hunt.  I don't like killing animals or things.  It kind of, you know, makes me feel bad.  I saw a deer cry once.  Ugh.  No.  Deers don't cry.  They just instinctively go like, meh, meh, when they're shot.  I saw one on the side of the road crying.  I'm like, ugh.  Crying?  I can't hunt.  Yeah, it sounded like crying to me.  I don't know.  I'm not saying don't hunt.  I don't give a crap what you do.  But that's when I realized there's no way I could do this. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut writes, Hillary was a Yank Mets fan.  I think you have to throw a little cubby in there, too.  A Yank Met cubby fan.  Yank Cub Mets.  Yank Cub Mets?  She's a Yank Cub Mets fan.  Yeah.  I mean, I understand the politicians, they don't want to make a lot of, you know,  they don't want to make a lot of decisions, especially during a campaign.  But it's safe to just, like, say you like one team.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, at least do that for us, please.  All right. 
[00:11:00]  I was watching, I was just spending some time with some videos and stuff last night online.  Not much action at my house yesterday.  There's been a lot of construction going on.  But I found this site that broadcasts live podcasts.  Oh, sweet.  Video podcasts and stuff.  And one of the top dogs on there is, what's his name?  Chocolate Rain.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a podcast.  He does.  And it was live. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  So I'm watching it.  And it's like a radio show that he wants to do.  Oh, which one are you looking at?  I already broke my foot because of that, Jimmy.  Don't worry about it.  I got to get an x-ray later today.  Page 12, page 12.  Yeah, and I already sent an email to the big boss.  Oh, is that that one?  Not the cute little boss.  I went all the way to the top.  No, no, he's talking about a story in the paper that's next to that pain in the ass thing.  I don't know what you mean.  I'm just talking about a different story.  Yeah.  We'll explain later.  He's got a podcast, and I'm just watching it. 
[00:12:00]  And it's him in a room with headphones on taking phone calls.  Yeah.  And it really kind of makes you feel good when you come in and do a radio show on a daily basis.  And it just feels like you come in and talk.  When you watch other people that absolutely have no capacity to do it.  Right.  I guess he figured since, you know, he did the Chocolate Rain song that he could kind  of branch out into other mediums like radio.  It was horrific.  I couldn't even listen as a goof. 
[00:12:30]  What was he talking about?  Nothing.  Really?  Absolutely nothing.  First of all, everybody is just...  Anyone that called in or typed stuff in was just going, sing.  Yeah.  Just sing and shut up.  Yeah.  And he's trying to take calls and get discussions started.  And it was all dead air because he just had nothing to say.  Right.  So he'd sit there for these big delays of dead air and then just say, um, okay.  You think people just call in and go, do the bed, do the bed, do the bed, do the bed, do 
[00:13:00]  the bed, do the bed, do the bed.  Because all they want to do, anyone that would tune in that podcast, they would probably hope  that he would do Chocolate Rain for a second or two.  Just do Chocolate Rain.  Do the bed, do the bed, do the bed.  People would call in and say they turn their head away from the phone so they can breathe.  You know, all the little catchphrases that came up because of this guy.  Sure, sure.  Hey, let me go to Chris in New York.  A lot of people are wondering about something we were going to do yesterday.  Yes, Chris. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  You guys killed me yesterday.  I know sometimes you run a little bit over nine.  So I waited for the break and I came back to K-Rock was playing Guns N' Roses Patience.  Yeah.  So I decided to wait for that for Homeless Roulette.  And it never came.  We couldn't find the guy.  Yeah.  There's a lunatic out there.  He's a homeless guy.  He looks miserable.  And we're not really sure if he's trying to be a tranny or something.  But he wears very sloppy lipstick. 
[00:14:00]  And I decided I need to get a picture of him for Opie's eye.  So I reached out my BlackBerry as I was handing him money and I clicked.  I was hoping I was going to get away with something.  He realized I took his picture and just lost his ass.  Chased me down the street.  Just causing a major commotion as people in their business suits are trying to get to work.  Yeah.  So we decided, no, we shouldn't leave him alone.  What we should do is do Homeless Roulette.  And we're all going to go to him and take his picture at the same time. 
[00:14:30]  But it was raining yesterday in New York so we couldn't find him.  We're going to try again today, though.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm looking forward to it, guys.  All right.  And by the way, we can't go past nine anymore.  You know, Stupid Us, we were trying to do the right thing and give a little extra radio.  And it came down from upstairs that they demand that we end before nine o'clock.  That's good.  When did that happen?  That's like free radio we're giving, you know, regular radio.  But that ended, too, yesterday.  When did that happen?  Ah, right?  Stump Ryan. 
[00:15:00]  It came down yesterday.  Was there a reason?  Yeah.  Both sides actually approached me separately and not under any agreement on their own.  I can see why Sirius would, because they're like, all right, get over here.  But why would...  Call Sirius.  Well, when we go over nine o'clock, that shoves eight minutes of commercials into the nine o'clock hour,  which already has 12 minutes.  Right.  So it then screws up that hour.  Okay.  And they want to get that started.  And your contract apparently says the show is supposed to end at 845.  Right.  But if we've got something really hot going on, it can go to 846. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, thanks.  Well, we'll end at 845 starting today.  No problem.  There you go.  Whatever you need.  Wait, wait.  Sorry we were giving you a little extra radio.  I didn't know that was a bad thing.  Maureen McCormick is calling at 845.  You know what?  That'll be a 30-second interview, then.  We'll just do it over at Sirius.  We'll do it over at Sirius.  That'll be a 30-second...  That'll be a 30-second...  I'm a little disgusted, Will.  Yeah.  We're going to take a quick break.  And I'm looking at the paper. 
[00:16:00]  It's just internal stupid business stuff.  Yeah.  I'll talk about it on the...  I'm so aggravated looking...  My head hurts.  Saw that story yesterday.  I hate the media so much.  I hate these people, the way they report things.  Saw that story yesterday.  And, wow.  It is the complete opposite.  Yes.  In both New York papers.  Yeah.  Yep.  The complete opposite.  This Marine killing in...  I'm not sure where it was.  We'll explain next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Stay there. </pre>
