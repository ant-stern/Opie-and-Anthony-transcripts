<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Larry King's introductory segment, followed by a discussion focused on two primary themes: revamping their "Line of the Day" segment and airing grievances against their SiriusXM management.  The hosts solicited listener suggestions for a new name, ultimately settling on a tongue-in-cheek option reflecting their live status and ongoing legal battles with the company.  This segued into a tirade against management, using highly offensive language and comparing their treatment to the abusive dynamics depicted in "Mommy Dearest," alleging favoritism and inconsistent application of rules.  The hosts also offered crude commentary on Tracy Morgan's apology tour, a Hallmark Father's Day card for Black mothers without fathers, and a New Zealand bar serving horse semen shots, engaging in graphic and vulgar jokes about all three topics. They also discussed a listener's story about a company's absurd policy regarding defibrillators.

The show then shifted to a discussion about the difficulties of creating successful sitcoms, contrasting *Seinfeld* with less successful shows. This transitioned into a discussion of a documentary on race in television, mentioning Rona Barrett and stereotypical portrayals of Black people in older shows.  The hosts returned to their discussion about the New Zealand pub serving apple-infused horse semen, further elaborating on its potential taste and texture, while fantasizing about obtaining some for the show. The conversation continued with reminiscences about their most outrageous past stunts, such as clam chowder-vomiting contests and Sergeant Magoo eating puke-filled Froot Loops, all recounted with graphic detail.  A significant portion dealt with technical difficulties with their online stream, leading to a humorous, recursive loop where they listened to a delayed feed of themselves discussing the delay, repeatedly revisiting the horse semen and vomiting anecdotes.  They briefly mentioned Sandy Kane's appearance on *America's Got Talent* and a news story about a perverted EMT, before concluding this segment with brainstorming absurd ideas for creating conflict with Howard Stern show colleagues, involving dog shit, baby powder, and flatulence.  A guest, Tom Pop, was introduced, and the hosts briefly discussed illnesses following their child's vaccinations.

The next segment began with a discussion about the unsanitary conditions in children's waiting rooms, which led to conversations about physical imperfections, self-administered medical procedures like skin tag removal, and a humorous description of a doctor's office receptionist.  The hosts then discussed a viral video of a woman with poor hygiene singing poorly. This transitioned into a discussion about childhood vaccinations, parental anxieties, and a host's encounter with a man he suspected of leering at his child.  The topic then shifted to bad breath, featuring anecdotes about personal experiences with bad breath, including a child's blunt assessment of their grandfather's breath.  The discussion covered various dental procedures, and a graphic video of a dental procedure was shown. A caller asked which was worse—morning breath or smoker's breath—leading to a broader discussion of body odor and scent preferences. Another caller shared a story about their father's needle phobia. Finally,  in-studio guest Michael Potts, known for his role as Brother Muzone in *The Wire*, joined the show.  The hosts expressed their admiration for *The Wire*, discussing Potts' character, creative input, and how his character contrasted with others.

The final segment largely consisted of the interview with Michael Potts.  They discussed his *Wire* character, Brother Muzone, including the memorable scene where he's shot, and an anecdote about Idris Elba's unhappiness with a script detail about urination.  The conversation continued to *The Book of Mormon*, covering his audition, the show's comedic content, positive audience reactions (including celebrity fans like Chevy Chase, Jim Carrey, Quentin Tarantino, and Meryl Streep), and his initial concerns about negative reactions from the Mormon community.  Specific funny moments from the musical were discussed, including the understudy for Josh Gad's role. The segment ended with the hosts promoting their shows, revisiting the "Line of the Day" name change, and discussing helicopters and extreme activities, specifically a high-rise freefall ride in Las Vegas.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah, good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, Larry King.  Thank you, Larry.  You should know who Jimmy Norton is.  That's good acting for him to pretend he didn't know who I was.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  It's Bobo King.  By the way.  Who is Jimmy Norton? 
[00:01:00]  So we got to, uh...  So we got to, uh...  No?  Okay.  Oh, God.  Please.  Every day is something.  Oh, did more happen, huh?  Well.  Oh.  It's been told to me.  Yeah.  You know how we're...  I don't even...  I just feel bad that, you know, there'd be any more talking tos. 
[00:01:30]  I feel bad for the support staff.  No, this isn't a bad thing.  Yeah.  It was brought to my attention through some of our people...  Yes.  ...that, uh...  We're bringing back Line of the Day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great.  Which is a staple of the Opie and Anthony show, right?  We've been doing it for years off and on.  Remember?  For Line of the Day.  Yes, of course.  I should be getting paid for that song.  Oh, well.  Well.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Maybe the song's gonna have to go away because...  Yeah.  ...it's been told to us that maybe we could pump it up and change the name from Line of 
[00:02:00]  the Day to something else.  Something else.  It's a little more...  ...catchy.  So you ask, oh, boy, are we gonna change it?  So we're looking for your suggestions for Line of the Day, what it should be called now.  Yeah.  Now, wait a minute.  And when we settle on a new name, it's gonna be so over-the-top complicated, and I want  a song, and I want production.  This suggestion came by Currier from Yawnsville. 
[00:02:30]  Yawn City.  Yawn City.  Yawn City.  By the way, a couple of people made up some great logos for Yawn City.  I couldn't tweet it.  Did you see...  Really?  Whoever did the one for Yawn City, I laughed my ass off yesterday.  I think Coke Logic did one that was like...  Coke Logic?  There was another guy, too.  Yeah, there was another one that looked really good.  And I didn't...  I didn't retweet because I know that is just...  That's...  That just has problems all over it.  Really?  Because there was a stereotype. 
[00:03:00]  Look at that.  Because it says Yawn City.  Greetings from Yawn City.  Oh, so it was Coke Logic's.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's great.  Yawn City, but the problem is it has like a lot of personalities in there.  And they would look at that as...  But are they real personalities?  I couldn't really tell on my little phone.  It looks to me like it's just generic corporate photos.  You sure?  From like...  Yeah, from like Google images or something.  But it looks like that's saying that Sirius XM is boring as a service, even though it's  not saying that. 
[00:03:30]  Right, right, right.  I got scared to retweet that.  I wouldn't have done that one, but I think it's great, but it sends the wrong message.  It doesn't get clarified.  Because it says Sirius XM satellite radio on the bottom under Yawn City, and that isn't  what we meant.  Right.  What we mean is the people down the hall, that's Yawn City.  Right, not the whole company.  No, no, that's Yawn City.  Right.  And I saw another one for the Bill Tetley logo.  Yeah, that was the Bill Tetley show, which was very funny.  It looked great.  The guy sends it to me.  I'm like, send it directly to Jimmy.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:04:00]  Could you retweet this?  Retweet it to Jimmy's name on it.  I'm not retweeting Yawn City until Randy Michaels calls me back.  When he calls me back, then I'll certainly retweet.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my, Jimmy.  You sure know how to keep cards under the...  Boy.  Who's Randy Michaels?  Well, you're going to know who Randy Michaels is soon enough.  He used to own...  Well, not own, but he used to be involved with Clear Channel back in the day.  Back in what they call...  He might be back in the business.  He might be back in business.  Rumor has it. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  No, it's not a rumor.  Well, rumor has it.  Now...  Oh, what part?  I don't know.  Okay.  What about the...  There's no rumors here.  Line of the day.  What do they want to call it?  Who suggested it?  Line of the day.  What was wrong with it?  What was wrong with the name of that?  Well, Jimmy, stop.  What are you?  Your personality on a radio show that knows what's entertaining, knows what people like  to hear and laugh to in the morning.  You're not a guy down the hall that feels, for some reason, line of the day needs a new 
[00:05:00]  name.  Like the FU line.  See, it isn't called call-in-and-rant line or call-about-your-grievances line.  Right.  You know, it's the FU line, man.  FU, man.  Look, basically, we've been asked to punch it up.  Punch it up a little bit.  This is a fine corporate term.  They want us to punch it up.  Punch it up a bit.  We can do better, guys.  Instead of line of the day, what would you like to call it?  Line of the day just sounds like, because what is it?  It's the line of the day.  So why call it that? 
[00:05:30]  It's a little too, I don't know, accurate.  The first one has come in.  Oh, good.  Line of the day, new name.  Something funny that was said because we're actually here and live today instead of on  vacation and suing the company.  Can we sing that?  Can we get production for that?  That's a good one.  That's exactly what I wanted to be called now.  I like that.  I don't even need to take any more suggestions.  Thank you, Joseph H.  Line of the day is now called, something funny that was said because we're actually  here and live today instead of on vacation and suing the company. 
[00:06:00]  That's kind of a...  Can we get a jingle company?  It's a little wordy, but I think...  Hey, if they want us to pump it up, we're going to pump it up.  Punch it up?  Punch it up.  How about...  Hold on.  I have an idea.  A funny...  A cute suggestion.  Something that says it all.  Here's something funny that was said despite the cunts in management. 
[00:06:30]  Why would they want us to punch up a basic bitch?  Punch it up.  It worked.  Especially...  And Jimmy came up with a song which pumped it up.  Or punched it up.  Which one do they use?  Punch it up.  Either one.  Punch it.  Punch it up.  Pump it up.  Punch it up.  That'd be the one.  All right.  Pump or punch.  So it's going to now be called something funny that was said because we're actually  here and live today instead of on vacation and suing the company. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Nice.  I hope we have time to actually do the lines.  I know.  Once we get through the title of the whole thing, we won't have time for the...  Well, I can't say line of the day, can I?  The thing that's said in humorous fashion throughout the course of the program.  That's weird that they would want us to punch that up.  Well, they just asked, right?  They said, how about just no?  We can't.  Hey, can you guys not punch him? 
[00:07:30]  No.  We can't.  No.  Under no circumstances will that be changed.  What do you think of that?  Okay.  Wait.  What do you think of them, Apple?  That's it.  There's no discussion.  Right.  I thought maybe you might want to...  No, we don't.  Well, we're on a roll lately, huh?  Oh.  That's all right.  That's just a suggestion.  We could say no.  So that was suggested instead of a raise suggested for somebody?  What are you talking about?  Oh, I wouldn't get into that.  What?  I'm not talking about anyone in particular.  A lot of raises need to be given out at this point. 
[00:08:00]  Remember how Mommy Dearest was really nice to the kids when other people were around?  Yes.  Mommy Dearest would take care of Christina and the little son and everything, and everything  looked nice.  It's like, oh my God, that Joan Crawford is amazing.  I understand.  See, we're like the people, the public, my fans.  We're like them.  And management is Joan Crawford.  By herself?  Yeah.  With the kid?  Well, yeah, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  And our staff is the kid.  Oh, boy.  So the second the public, we leave, that's when the wire hangers come out.  Oh.  And the children get beaten.  Oh.  And strapped to the bed.  And made to get the axe to cut the tree down.  And management comes in with kabuki makeup on and says, clean this up.  And makes some of the staff eat raw steak.  So what do we do? 
[00:09:00]  We have to stay here?  No, but, you know.  Should we take them with us?  I'm just saying that's what happens.  I got a couple spare rooms.  I could take them with us so they're safe.  No, I think it'll just have to run its course.  And then eventually the staff will write, you know, management dearest.  Oh, boy.  That's a great observation, sir.  It really is exactly what happens here.  Because we hear the next day, you know, certain things that happen in our stead, you know.  And it's not pretty. 
[00:09:30]  Do you think they beat up our staff because they know they can't beat us up anymore?  For the most part, yeah.  I'm not even going for a funny there.  I think that's what happens.  Wow.  I've never seen a yes quite written that way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would think so.  Because the old days, we took the beating, right?  We took a lot of beatings in our careers.  And we're to the point with the FU money and all that.  And I want to keep saying that because people really are digging the fact that we don't give a fuck.  A beating.  That they can't beat us anymore, so they beat our staff down. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, they beat the staff down.  Well, that doesn't seem fair now, does it?  It really doesn't.  It doesn't, but que sera, sera.  But now they know why I come up with terms like cute, babysitter, skill set.  Skill set?  That's my way of helping the boys out a little bit.  Because that cuts deep psychologically when you say stuff like that.  Yeah.  As long as we adhere to what we're supposed to do, then we don't get yelled at. 
[00:10:30]  So that's like, you know, show up and talk into these things.  We can't just sit here like this.  Watch, watch.  See, we can't do that.  No.  So as long as we're just yapping into these things and we're here, we're golden.  You can't really yell at us.  But then you guys, wow, you got a lot of shit to do.  You can't just sit and talk.  You got to like do some other shit that I have no concept of what it is or why it is.  And remember, it's all your fault. 
[00:11:00]  But it's all your fault in the end.  It is.  That's another flow chart.  Tina!  Get the X!  Solutions, though.  Interns.  Raises for the staff.  Oh, shh.  They haven't had raises in a really, really long time.  The second they deserve them, they'll get them.  That's what I say.  Atta boy.  A real event that we can wrap our minds around.  Not just wireless mics in Times Square.  A bigger studio would be nice like it was promised to us. 
[00:11:30]  We'll start there.  We'll start with those things.  Solutions to the problems.  Because they don't want to hear just bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  Yeah.  Right?  I don't want to hear bitch.  There's some solutions today.  By the way.  Yes.  Boyd away.  Boyd away.  Boyd away.  Boyd away.  I was watching a program last night that showed people eating a pound of butter.  Nice.  And then vomiting.  Nice.  It was on television.  Yeah.  It was on Comedy Central. 
[00:12:00]  But it was there.  And that's no different than serious satellite radio.  Right.  You know, we're able to get around FCC rules here.  Right.  But for some reason, isn't there a vomiting problem here?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They showed people vomiting.  Of course they did.  On television.  You heard, bleh, you heard it.  You saw it.  Bodily Fluid.  What?  And is Comedy Central getting this obscenity thing going because there's vomiting on there?  I'd like that looked into with everything else, too. 
[00:12:30]  Please.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I would like someone to get back to me on the vomiting thing.  Bodily Fluid, I understand if someone's jerking off and wants to come in a secretary's face.  I could see there could be a problem there if somebody wants to do that.  Could be.  Could be.  Some might welcome that.  Maybe.  Some.  But I'm just wondering why on earth that's a problem?  Well, you'll be told they're working on it and making progress. 
[00:13:00]  Has it been kicked upstairs?  They're making progress on that.  By the way, this isn't a best-of show.  You haven't tuned in yet.  Don't blame E-Rock and say E-Rock somehow put on yesterday's show because I heard this  already yesterday morning.  That's right.  Can I have a list of things they're making progress on, please?  I know the interns they're making progress on.  Yeah, that's already being greenlit.  I know as long as you ask for raises every week, eventually it might happen.  Yeah, yeah.  It's your fault for not asking. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Puking.  Why we can't have vomit.  Interns, raises, vomit audio.  Vomit audio.  These are things that they're making progress on?  No.  Oh, good.  Is vomit audio...  Yeah, that's being kicked upstairs.  The vomit's being kicked upstairs.  That's been kicked upstairs.  I have no idea.  That's good.  That's good news.  I would like to know why, though, the vomit is in the same realm as, like, jizz and pre-cum.  We even were like, all right, you know, we understand the jizz thing, I guess, because 
[00:14:00]  it can be construed as being an obscenity, something obscene for pure an interest.  Wow.  I love that one when they hit us with that one.  But vomit does not even fit in that category.  Yet it is some type of bodily fluid.  It is not like jizzing.  You know?  Get me?  Gotcha.  You feeling me?  I'm feeling it.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  And I see it on TV.  Yeah, it's just a little bile.  It's not the right.  Got to cut it out of the show.  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother.  It's one thing to maybe tell us we can't do the eggnog drinking challenge anymore, but  to actually not be able to play the ones we've done in the past.  Play the ones we've done is...  I don't even know what to say.  It's ludicrous.  I don't even know what to say.  I don't get it.  Someone will sit down and try to explain it to us, and I'll just stare at them like, 
[00:15:00]  I will never understand this.  Well, we're national.  So it's Comedy Central.  Yeah, we're a pay service, like, you know, Cable, where that...  Yet they could show...  Not only you hear them, they show people vomiting and play the vomit noise, and we can't do it  because it's lumped into the same thing that they feel might get them an obscenity.  It's simply...  We've said it before.  I don't know.  Attorneys not doing their jobs properly, and being 50 steps before the problem because 
[00:15:30]  they're not really free thinkers.  Or 50 steps before what they think will be a problem, and will never, never materialize  into a problem, but...  Right.  Yeah.  Again, it's that all blankets...  They can't see the difference between playing audio of somebody puking and actually having  somebody underage in the studio and shitting in their mouth.  They cannot, as attorneys, see the difference between those things.  And just because we can't in our own homes...  Absolutely.  ...doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to... 
[00:16:00]  Or our sexual fantasies.  Right.  Well, but you saw the show, and they were doing that.  Yeah, they were doing that.  Are we allowed to do, like, the Mayonnaise Challenge?  Wait, there's no more puking in studios?  So if Bob Kelly sees something crazy on the internet, we know he pukes very easily, or dry heaves,  at least.  Yeah.  We're not allowed to do that anymore?  I don't think so.  If we show them something on the internet, that's been a staple bit for a few years now.  I think we're not allowed to do things that the intentional purpose is to have someone 
[00:16:30]  vomit.  But we've done a million...  I think.  But why?  Why turn the mics on?  Yeah, exactly.  But what has changed?  We've done a million puke bits.  What has changed all of a sudden?  Lawyers have to go...  They get a complaint or something?  Lawyers are talking to each other going, oh, we haven't come up with anything new in a  while.  They're going to realize they could probably let us go, at least one of us, and we'll be  out of a job.  So let's make something up real quick and submit it so we have a job tomorrow. 
[00:17:00]  That's pretty much what happens.  So that's just a new rule that popped up?  Yay.  For no reason, though.  No reason.  There was no issue.  No one complained.  I can name at least 10 bits where we had puking and it was hilarious.  And now we're not allowed to do that?  Yeah.  Seriously?  Positive.  Are we allowed to replay it?  No.  Can we have a puking best of at least?  Oh, no, no.  What?  Oh, no.  I don't know.  We can't play it?  You know what happens if we play puke sounds?  Forget about it.  The world ends. 
[00:17:30]  It's amazing.  We can play clips and comment as if we're covering it.  What if we just play the clips?  What if we said, hey.  We can't just play the clips.  We have to comment on the clips?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  No one even knows.  They're overthinking everything.  How overthought is that?  That's just real.  What would be the difference between the two?  And once again, they will sit us down and try to explain that.  And I'll just stare at them and I'll go, I will never understand your explanation.  What would the difference between about playing old puking clips as is and playing old puking 
[00:18:00]  clips and commenting on it?  What would be the difference to the person that might have a problem with this that could  cause an issue with the company?  Wouldn't it be the same thing in the end?  Opie, you just don't look at the big picture.  Now think of us.  We're all sitting in a courtroom, right?  Yeah.  And of course, this has gone to trial.  This puke audio, someone upset by it, goes to trial.  Now we're all having a big fight there in court about this whole thing. 
[00:18:30]  That's where that comes into play.  Now we commented over it.  Your Honor, we see because it's really going to reach that point someday.  But in the end, they don't even have our backs when it comes to that stuff, as you know.  Of course not.  They don't even have our backs.  Without getting too deep, they don't even have our backs if we do have an issue.  No.  There wouldn't be an issue.  There wouldn't be.  All right.  We should move on because... 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  Until Randy Michaels calls, I can't take too many chances here.  This is crazy.  Hey, Tracy Morgan.  He was just on iMis, I think.  Is he still on the news?  He was on iMis?  I believe he was just on iMis, yeah.  He was saying voice of Tracy Morgan.  It might have been no playing something.  I don't know if they were actually playing it.  Oh, he's probably playing what we're going to play.  Oh, okay.  The Tracy Morgan apology tour continues.  You're ripping me off.  What does he have to do today for GLAAD?  I think he's actually to the point where he has to accept a penis in his mouth. 
[00:19:30]  Damn.  Today's the day.  Wow.  Where is that going to be?  I read that.  Today's the day.  Times Square?  Macy's Window.  That's where you're doing things.  Oh, kiss my ass in Macy's Window.  When Tracy Morgan does this for Macy's Window, will GLAAD finally let him go?  No.  Tracy Morgan is pretty much a slave of GLAAD right now.  He's a slave.  GLAAD has brought back slavery with Tracy Morgan.  They have setbacks to the civil rights movement hundreds of years with this situation. 
[00:20:00]  They will let Tracy know when they're done with him.  Are they done with him?  I'm not an animal.  I'm a human being.  Yesterday he did press conferences and meetings and Q&A.  I don't know.  He did all sorts of stuff.  He did all sorts of stuff.  A bunch of everything.  He has got to be the most informed straight man on gay issues at this point.  I know everything about gay peoples.  If you know Tracy a little bit, he's losing his mind. 
[00:20:30]  The second he gets home and shuts that door, what's coming out of Tracy's mouth has got  to be hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  He's hugging people now.  Yeah.  I'm hugging you.  We're two men just hugging.  We're allowed to do that.  I'll even kiss a man.  Look, he's hugging gay guys now.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  And they have the same shirt on.  He even matched shirts with the guy.  Looks like he's hugging Meatloaf from Fight Club.  Fight Club in that one. 
[00:21:00]  Old bitch tits.  What the hell, man?  Yeah.  What the hell?  Come here.  Let me give you a hug.  I love you.  I don't care if you're gay.  You want to hear the Tracy Morgan apology?  I would love to.  From yesterday.  Nothing else.  I would love to hear this.  All right.  I apologize to Kevin, the people that were at the show, for bumming him out.  I want to apologize to my friends and my family and my fans. 
[00:21:30]  Now, let's break this down a little bit.  First of all, it doesn't even sound like him.  No, because his throat's raspy because he's been apologizing.  So much.  Yeah.  Maybe it's raspy from some other.  Oh, boy.  Before you apologize, you need to know how it is to be a fruit-a-loo.  Here you go.  I don't know.  And is he really apologizing to his friends and family like they were offended?  I'd say no.  Hell fucking no.  There's no way they were. 
[00:22:00]  If you know Tracy to be considered a friend or his family, you would know that he doesn't  have to apologize to you.  All kidding aside, it's despicable what Glad's doing.  Oh, watch with the fucking language there.  You're going to get us in trouble.  Oh.  Oh, that's different.  Hey, we're fans of the gays.  Let's be honest with each other.  This Glad thing is ridiculous, though.  It is retarded.  Oh, shit.  I can't say retarded.  It's our word.  It's stupid. 
[00:22:30]  No, no.  That's people that might be.  Developmentally disabled.  Imbecillic.  Yeah, but why point that out in a person?  That's not good.  That's true.  That's not nice.  Words hurt.  Words hurt.  Everyone's robots now.  We're all robots.  Words hurt.  Like brass knuckles.  They really hurt.  Brass.  What year is this?  Meh.  Tracy Morgan.  And everyone in every community who are offended with this, I didn't know.  I didn't mean it. 
[00:23:00]  Please don't take my 30 rock money.  Yeah.  Look, I need my 30 rock money.  You should pay my rent.  He's not talking that way.  Pay for my children.  He's not talking that way, though.  I'd like to apologize.  This sounds like, this sounds, though, like, I don't know if he wrote it or whatever, but  it doesn't, it sounds like, like, at least, so far, it's his words.  I mean, a lawyer wouldn't write bummed out at the end of the show.  Could you punch it up with a bummed out? 
[00:23:30]  Like, I think it's sincere, but I think Glad scared the living shit out of him and basically  probably showed him a few things they are capable of doing if he doesn't play by their  rules.  Yeah.  Here's what happens to your 30 rock money.  This is what happens.  They probably bring up a whole list of names, like, remember, and you would go, oh, my God,  yeah, that guy was in every movie and he had a TV series.  Remember he disappeared?  Holy crap.  That was our doing.  Let's go through that.  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, and you'd be like, oh, shit.  He did fall off the face of the earth.  What did he do?  He was caught talking during the Tonys.  Oh, no.  Right.  To drag Tracy Morgan this far is just, it really is despicable.  His cell phone rang during Les Mis.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  And, um.  All right.  That's how I feel about it.  I don't have a hateful bone in my body.  I don't believe that anyone should be bullied or just made to feel bad about who they are. 
[00:24:30]  I totally feel that in my heart.  I really don't care who you love, same sex or not, as long as you have the ability to love.  At this point in my life, it's an opportunity to make a difference.  Oh, boy.  And I don't really see gay or straight.  I just see human beings now.  I pride myself on 20 years, 18 years of stand-up, of using it to heal people and not hurt. 
[00:25:00]  That was my whole thing.  And I hurt people with this.  Dr. Morgan.  He didn't hurt anybody.  He hurt a couple people maybe in the audience.  Maybe.  That's what comics do.  Maybe.  That's what comedy is about, by the way.  You take something, you know, you twist it around.  Someone might be like, ooh, a little offended if it directly affects them.  Everyone else is laughing their asses off.  And you've got to realize that sometimes it's your turn in the barrel. 
[00:25:30]  But our jobs really aren't, I don't see them as to help or to hurt or heal.  It's basically to make fun of life as I see it.  Yes.  You're not a doctor.  You don't have to help or heal people.  I had a driver one time in L.A. taking me to NBC.  Describe it.  He put it well.  We were talking about some backlash.  What's that?  Nothing.  And he was talking about, I forget what comedian was in trouble at the time.  It was somebody, it might have been I, but he was talking about how your job as a comic 
[00:26:00]  is not, he said when there's a knot in the muscle, a comic's job is to go in and not  avoid it, but to take your knuckle and dig it into that.  Yeah, that's right.  That's what you're supposed to do.  When there's something bugging everybody, your job is to go, all right, excuse me, excuse  me, and walk right up to it and make fun of it.  Sure.  And maybe make sense of it, but I think that your job, if you can find something funny in  it, is to do that.  And that's what I like to do as a comic.  And the results, how people, you want them to laugh. 
[00:26:30]  You don't expect them to be healed by it.  You don't want them to be hurt by it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, it's a chance to laugh at something.  Maybe that's the way Tracy sees it.  I don't know.  Maybe some guys see it differently, you know?  I don't know.  He's a, I think he's been scared.  I sneezed bodily fluids.  Edit that out.  He might have learned something, but I don't think he believes that he did anything wrong.  I'm learning.  I don't think he did anything wrong that night.  I don't think he believes it.  No.  If you really sat him down. 
[00:27:00]  If he thinks he did something wrong, what the fuck is he going to do when he gets up  and does stand-up?  Oh, now he's fucked up.  I've seen, I've seen Tracy's act.  What is he going to do?  He goofs on people.  He goofs on a lot of shit.  Like now he's, all that's gone.  What is he going to do?  Right.  What about them airplane peanuts?  I'll tell you something.  They'll give you the little peanuts.  Oh, no.  He can't say, I'll get you pregnant.  I'll get you pregnant.  Because that's not good.  Unwet mothers, I apologize. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, that's not good.  For the unwet mothers out there.  No, there's plenty of them.  And they're...  It's just sad.  It hurts them.  It really is just sad.  Is this it, though?  Yeah.  They're letting them go, finally?  Yeah.  Did you hear...  More of the apology coming up.  Oh, is there?  Yeah, yeah.  Hallmark is in a little bit of a jam up.  Why?  What did they do?  Because they put out a card for Father's Day directed toward black mothers.  Oh.  That says, you know, thank you for being there for Father's Day. 
[00:28:00]  You give this card to your moms because your dad ain't there.  And now black groups are getting pissed thinking that they're just profiting off of the black community in this.  Even though, even though two-thirds of black families are fatherless, as opposed to one-third, which is the national average.  So instead of seeing it as maybe there's an issue there that has to be addressed, they see it as Hallmark, just trying to dive in and make some cash, which they probably are. 
[00:28:30]  And they see a market for it, but why not exploit that market?  Why is there a problem with that?  Why is there a problem?  If they want to profit off that.  And why not make it available to people?  If there's a market for it, then make it available.  Well, there is a market.  I think it's called Mother's Day.  Yeah, yeah.  Why not just avoid, like, not give anybody something?  Well, because some kids walk around sad.  Oh, they walk around all sad that they got nothing to do.  What does this card say?  Hallmark of Twats.  It says, for all the times you've been there for others, you deserve a day just for you. 
[00:29:00]  Bud was.  Oh, shit.  Well, how does that say Father's Day?  Well, it's meant to give to your mother on Father's Day.  It doesn't say, Happy Father's Day, Mom.  But it's an implied thing that that card is there in the Father's Day section.  It's made by Hallmark for the whole Father's Day collection thing. 
[00:29:30]  That's part of the Ebony series.  Part of the Mahogany series.  Of course.  I used to get those for my mom all the time.  Yeah.  I'd get, like, the black cards.  And we'd all laugh at my relative's house because they'd be like, ah, ah, ah.  And then the word would fly around.  Oh, it's just great.  Anyone who thinks, by the way, that I'm kidding.  During the recent Father's Day slash Mom's Birthday party we had at my house last Sunday, 
[00:30:00]  people were just stunned and amazed at my Aunt Fran.  She is a throwback and just a joy.  The words that fly out of her mouth, you'd absolutely think it was pre-Jim Crow.  Just amazing.  Had a lot of fun, though.  Yeah, so now they're getting upset about that.  But the truth of the matter is, you know, it's two-thirds of the African-American families.  And, you know, there's an opening there to throw some greeting cards in. 
[00:30:30]  Hallmark isn't, they throw them in for everything.  Yeah.  So, you know, let them deal with that.  So what's going to happen to Hallmark?  Apologize.  Apologize for putting that card out.  That's what I do.  Everyone's going to apologize.  Yeah.  We should have an apology day.  Ugh.  For everyone.  We should.  We could give each other cards.  Can we call it something else, though?  Punch it up a little bit.  Punch it up.  Punch it up a bit from apology.  Yeah, punch it up a little bit.  I don't feel like thinking about that right now. 
[00:31:00]  Here's more of Tracy Morgan's apology.  Glad holding him hostage.  My whole thing.  And I hurt people with this.  He pulled his dick out right then.  He told me I did.  At the bottom of my heart, I apologize to everybody.  Again, he has to apologize.  Who are offended with my words on stage.  He offended.  In Nashville and anywhere else.  I just apologize to you.  Wow.  Is he apologizing?  And I want to take this opportunity.  I mean, to err is human, but to forgive is divine. 
[00:31:30]  Make that up.  These young people here forgave me.  Good bumper sticker.  Thank you, Kevin.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thanks.  For your support and forgiving me.  And I just want to take this opportunity to help and not hurt.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I also want to apologize.  I sent the Hindenburg on fire.  That was me.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry about that. 
[00:32:00]  I was listening very closely.  He said stage.  And that was his way of saying, I fucking did this on a stage.  Do you guys understand that?  I blew up the space shuttle.  I feel bad about that.  If I hurt somebody, I apologize.  He goes on stage.  Yeah.  He made it clear on stage.  You think that was a code?  Like when you got the AK-47 against your head and you're reading some fucking Muslim shit  and you just kind of put the one finger out when you're holding the paper to make it 
[00:32:30]  look like you're flipping the bird?  That was a signal?  Oh, yeah.  You think Tracy will ever talk to Kevin again?  You think they're going to be pals now?  Yeah.  He's going to forget his name as soon as he boards that flight back to New York.  Done with Nashville and hopefully done with Glad at this point.  I won't apologize for cop-out.  I liked cop-out.  I know.  I think he's overwhelmed.  Yeah.  I think he's just overwhelmed.  Sure.  With...  I mean, Tracy's never had his words scrutinized like this by the entire country. 
[00:33:00]  I agree.  You know, I...  You want to make sure it gets out, you're sorry.  All these fucking media outlets and news channels.  It's like, how do you get the word out to everybody who has been harping on every word?  It's probably very frustrating to be in that position.  I shot Kennedy.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry about that.  I shot Kennedy.  You think Hitler came up with the idea for the Jews?  That was Tracy Morgan.  I apologize. 
[00:33:30]  I'm going to have him calling some of my ex-girlfriends, apologizing for my bad sexual performances,  lack of erections.  What the fuck, man?  Hopefully that's it for him, finally.  He should not have to be doing...  How long is this going on?  When did this happen?  He's got a busy schedule.  Even Imus didn't do it this long.  Nah.  I'm sorry I did that.  Yeah, they...  You know, they're not going to kill him, though. 
[00:34:00]  That's good.  Yeah.  They're going to let one go.  Because usually they kill you in the end.  No, they're just going to keep him fucking tied up.  Keep him hostage.  It's day what?  Like the hostage crisis.  Bless you.  Three weeks ago?  So they've had Tracy for three weeks off and on.  Wow.  They've had him for about three weeks.  Wow.  Wow, that's not right.  Swing low, sweet champion.  I won't be a free man. 
[00:34:30]  I need the Underground Railroad.  Damn.  Poor bastard.  Just taking all the heat for this for nothing.  Stop it.  Hey, is there really a bar serving horse semen shots?  Did you read about this?  Oh, it's delicious.  Yeah.  Is this real?  Great play.  I hope so.  What the fuck is that supposed to be?  Drink up.  Yeah.  Come on.  Mr. Ed's place.  That's great.  You should see the tap they serve it out of.  Yeah.  It's big. 
[00:35:00]  It's hard to work.  Yeah.  You've got to twist the head.  Yeah, it's a special thing.  You've got to pour like a Guinness.  You've got to have a special pour.  Give the fuck this hay on the floor.  Why would a bar serve horse semen?  Well, it's a bar serving horse semen shots.  Apple infused.  What?  I don't mind an apple infused shot every once in a while.  Well.  That's right.  With horse cum?  Horse semen.  Well, I said.  Women flock to take horse semen shots.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:35:30]  Nice.  Apple infused horse semen shots might not be an obvious chaser to spring rolls, but they  are causing a stir at the Green Man Pub.  Where is this?  The shots are part of the Central Wellington's pub's entry in the nationwide 14th annual  Montia's Beer and Wild Food Challenge.  This is crazy.  Is this like where people go and eat like alligator knuckles and shit?  Sure.  Horse cum.  Horse cum.  Are we allowed to try the apple infused horse semen shots on this show?  No.  Oh. 
[00:36:00]  I don't think so.  It's in the news.  How great would that be?  We have a bunch of shots around and we see who would be brave enough to try it out.  Oh, yeah.  You'll go first.  Horse semen.  Yeah.  It's got to taste nasty.  What does it do besides make your breath good, give you a hard on?  Green Man Pub chef Jason Varley said the drink was proving most popular with women, like  you said.  Well, of course.  Ladies thought it was great.  They throw it in their face after they get drunk.  Yeah.  Throw it in the back. 
[00:36:30]  As you're throwing them out the car, it's in their hair.  There you go.  Beat it, bitch.  Hey, apple cum breath.  Hit the road.  Oh, it's New Zealand.  All right.  Ladies thought it was great.  A couple were going to go home and get their husbands to eat grass, he said.  What?  Oh, I guess it would make it taste better or something.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, that's going to be the apple infused part.  Yeah.  Weren't there pills that do this?  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Weren't there pills that sell?  Let's go talk to Tim Savian.  Remember Tim Savian?  It was Tim's friend.  Right.  He was a sponsor.  What was the name of that again?  He was on the show.  Sweet release.  Sweet release.  Sweet release.  And it made your jizz taste like banana or apple or cherries.  And you take these pills and...  Tim's friend mortgaged his house for this crap.  Lost his shirt.  Did he really?  Really took off.  What do you think?  Have you heard of sweet release since the NAW days?  It sounds like one of Cramden's ideas. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Sweet release is online?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's still there?  Oh, yeah.  And what does it say about it?  It changes the sexual taste and scent of the male body secretion.  Boy, they don't want to be blunt on that one, huh?  Health benefits for men.  How is there health benefits?  I guess because you're eating better to make your...  Protein. 
[00:38:00]  Calm, taste better?  Protein.  Antibacterial properties are in sweet release.  Promotes lower cholesterol.  Helps the body's immune system.  Omega-6 and omega-3 oil balances.  Oh.  And helps in the development of healthy dream states.  This guy needs to be investigated.  He needs to be investigated.  By the FDA.  Give me the phone number, the FDA.  Even the FDA. 
[00:38:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  A couple of them were worried they might bear children with long faces, he joked.  Ah, a little long in the face.  A little horse face joke right there for you.  Men have not been so keen on the concoction.  A concoction.  The men were very standoffish.  But a few have manned up and said it is tasty.  I want to apologize to those people.  I don't think that's right. 
[00:39:00]  That's hurtful.  It's my favorite beverage.  Yeah, I love it now.  Yeah, my favorite beverage.  I drink it by the gallon.  Horse cum is good for everybody.  Jimmy does a pretty good Tracy.  Yeah.  It's my man.  Only when talking about horse cum.  Horse cum.  I apologize.  You know, when you're drinking, you got to dig them horse balls around a bit.  I don't know why you got to move the head around when you talk like Tracy.  You got to dip your fingers in.  Rub it on your lips so you got flavor. 
[00:39:30]  Say you're sorry.  When you talk and apologize, they like the smell of your breath.  They accept.  When you're hugging them, they're smelling something they like.  Yeah.  It's like putting on Fabergé for the gay.  That was the smell on their neck.  Somebody was kissing them with that on their lips.  Can I go back to that last line?  I'm sorry.  The last line is classic, and I want to read it again. 
[00:40:00]  Yes, please.  And let me know what you're thinking as you hear this sentence.  Ew.  The men were very standoffish, but a few have manned up and said it's tasty.  Manned up.  I think the type of man that is, quote, manning up is not really manning up.  But he's saying it's tasty.  They're probably pushing people out of the way to get to the bar first.  Tasty.  I'm not feeling that.  Well, it said palatable, but I had a problem with that word. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, palatable?  Palatable.  I needed three minutes to try to figure out how to pronounce it, and now I can say it.  How are you going to say it?  Palatable.  Palatable, of course.  What is palabinese?  Palabinese?  Mr. Varley, who's the barkeeper, I guess, admits to trying the drink himself, which he said  was okay and like custard.  Oh, it's disgusting.  Oh, man.  It's all the consistency of custard.  You could make a pie out of it.  Yeah.  That'd make a good pie filling. 
[00:41:00]  We had cum pie after we said I was sorry.  I called over as an apology gesture.  I said, I'm sorry.  I brought up a cum pie for everybody.  Get a good one.  It's hard to cut it.  Gotta lick the knife.  Yeah, I like licking the beaters after we make the cum pie.  I shouldn't say beaters.  I'm sorry to any women that don't listen during the game.  I want to apologize.  Apologize.  Love you, Tracy. 
[00:41:30]  Poor apologizing Tracy.  I hope they let you go soon.  Consistency of custard.  Custard.  You know we have to do this for the radio show.  Oh, no.  Do some research.  We need some horse cum in studio.  I literally...  Sterilize horse cum that we do...  What is it?  Apple infused.  I'll produce a little.  So you get some honey.  I thought you were going to let them put it in your ass.  No.  I'll produce some... 
[00:42:00]  Would you think less of me if I farted some out?  Not a bit.  I'll say I'm sorry.  I don't see people that fart that horse cum.  I just see people.  I see people.  Thank you.  I won't hurt nobody.  I'm here to heal.  Yo, he looks stupid.  I'm sorry.  I'm here to heal.  You could use a couple of stitches in your anus.  Mars, would you try the apple infused horse cum?  What do I get for that?  Oh, he wants that 180.  How about you get being called a team player for the program? 
[00:42:30]  Eternal damnation?  How about...  How about you get an opportunity to join me when I flee this fucking joint?  There you go.  In that case, I will.  All right.  The consistency of custard.  I keep going back to that.  That doesn't sound good.  Nice thick load of horse cum.  Oh, my God.  I got to drink V8 now.  You can probably take a bite out of it.  I think it is.  Do you know how thick horse cum must be?  Why can't they water that shit down?  Damn.  That probably is watered out.  It's like yogurt.  Have you ever seen a horse cum? 
[00:43:00]  No.  You've never seen a horse gag?  Oh, yeah.  Or fucking...  You ever see a horse shoot a load?  No.  Horses shoot cum.  It literally...  It looks like a frosting tube that was stepped on by an elephant.  Horses cum, might I say, a whole big bunch.  Yeah, it is a lot.  And very, uh, extremely thick.  Well, if it's like custard, I imagine.  Yeah.  But that big horse prostate probably has a fucking trigger on it.  Oh, Jesus.  Because that's why horse dicks are so big.  And they fuck so hard. 
[00:43:30]  That animal smell.  They're so, uh...  They're very fast, though, on the draw.  Ah, they come quick.  They sometimes...  Because I used to watch horses when they were breeding.  You know, the horses at the stable?  Look at this shit.  And they just...  That's how they artificially inseminate.  Why does he have to...  They have to collect the jizz.  Why does he have to fart gym equipment?  He's fucking a pommel horse.  Yeah, why?  He's fucking a...  What is he called?  Yeah, a pommel horse.  A pommel horse.  Like a leather-bound thing.  Doesn't Olga Corbett have to use that later? 
[00:44:00]  How did they get him to fuck that?  I don't know.  They must put, like, a really good artificial horse vagina in it.  You know how stupid the horse feels?  Like, I just can't control myself.  That's the horse jerking off.  Yeah.  Why would you let him just fuck a horse?  Or jerk him off?  Because they've got to save the jizz.  Because the jizz is very expensive.  All right, they put some fucking...  Something in the horse.  That's all they do.  Look, here's a better one.  It's an artificial horse.  Oh, he just jammed it right in there.  He really jammed...  A guy took that and died. 
[00:44:30]  And look, you can see all the jizz coming out of the bottom in that tube.  What the fuck?  That's a lot of shots right there.  I love the way you can see the horse's little...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's pouring out like a faucet.  How do you explain that?  It's the pummel horse, and then they have, like, a receiving faucet thing.  So it collects the comb.  And beakers.  And then starts pouring out of this, like, faucet apparatus. 
[00:45:00]  Did you drink that?  No.  I got it.  He was humping that pummel horse for, like, three seconds.  And then you just saw all those test tubes filling up with horse jizz.  Can you imagine kissing a girl, and her mouth tasted like the hole of a pummel horse?  Hey, pummel horse, not whole breath.  Pummel horse holes.  My new favorite reference.  People are deeply disturbed.  Hey, I dropped my gum in the hole of a pummel horse.  Can you get that for me? 
[00:45:30]  Did you get it?  They're also deeply disturbed that I came up with Olga Corbett.  Oh, little Olga Corbett.  She's now 56 years old.  Is she?  I want a pummel horse for my fucking room.  How great would that be?  Just get up and fuck it.  Just watching porn, you fuck it.  Although, wouldn't it have to be a little lower than his?  And I wouldn't want my hands just flailing silly.  Doesn't have to be that deep, either.  I would just tweak my nipples.  I know, you only need one little test tube at the bottom.  That's a particularly good two-shooter. 
[00:46:00]  God, horses come a lot.  I want to be a horse.  You really do.  Oh, that would surprise a gal.  I want to come on somebody's, the top of somebody's sandals.  Like, you know how mad people would be if you came a horse-sized load on the top of somebody's sandals?  And you got all of their bare feet?  Oh, would they be angry with you?  Because sand would mix in as they hit the beach?  Oh, Jesus.  They'd have to wipe your cum and sand off their feet?  Oh, by gum.  David in Israel has something on the Tracy Morgan Apology Tour.  Ah. 
[00:46:30]  Good morning, boys.  Hello.  Let's go, David.  How are you guys?  Anthony, I wanted to be one thing up.  I spoke to somebody in the company that used to work for a while back,  and I had a question about equipment they had over there.  Yes.  Sorry.  They used to be an EMT.  They had a defibrillator there.  And I asked them why they had a problem with the battery, why they weren't replacing it.  And she said the corporate policy stated they weren't allowed to use it,  even if someone had to fall down on a heart attack, because they were scared of getting sued.  And instead, the instructions from HR was, 
[00:47:00]  call 911, let the EMTs and the paramedics from 911 handle it.  You can't use it, because we're scared of getting sued.  Where was this?  I really can't say the name of the company, because then I'm going to lose my source of information.  And this is why we talk about corporate environments, by the way.  Because they get really confused in, what is it called?  Lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy.  Yon City.  Yon City.  Yon City.  Sorry.  Yon City, yeah.  Wow.  Lazy, oops.  Lazy.  That was a slip.  That was a slip.  That's what we are.  Oops.  That was a slip. 
[00:47:30]  Yon City.  This is why, because they don't understand.  This is why we do it, because people can relate to the stuff we're saying.  Because this is happening everywhere in corporate America.  I saw, if you, if you.  Oh, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Oh, yes, sir.  They don't want to talk over David.  It's not corporate bullshit when it comes to money, what you could do, what you can't do,  what you could do, what you can't do.  I mean, you have somebody here that could be dying, and they're more scared about how  many shekels they're going to be losing.  Oh, exactly.  Yes, yes, because what if it doesn't work? 
[00:48:00]  Then the family's going to sue you, which, you know, everyone's at fault there.  Sure.  We're too litigious in this country.  Uh, no offense, David, for the litigation, because the lawyers are...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I implied that all Jews are lawyers.  Some are doctors, too.  I apologize.  Didn't you have something on Tracy Morgan there, David?  What?  It says... 
[00:48:30]  No, it wasn't on Tracy.  I called up before you guys were speaking on Tracy when you were still complaining about what...  Yeah.  All right, that's funny.  No biggie.  All right, well, thank you for your call, David.  Hey, could you actually go to the place where Jesus was crucified?  How would I give a fuck about him?  I'm Jewish.  But you're a little closer than I.  Yeah, it's still a historical site.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm asking if you can.  I don't even know where it is, to be honest.  Isn't it close to him? 
[00:49:00]  You ain't...  It was all close.  How far did they travel?  They had no car.  Right, you're close to where he was crucified.  And I hear he could actually go to the spot, and even if you're not religious, it's pretty  intense to be there.  Never been there.  Don't know where it is.  Yeah.  Wow.  The judge doesn't like talking about Jesus.  I'm sure, yeah.  I'll talk about him, but I just...  You don't want to talk about Jesus now, do you, sir?  I don't care if I talk about Jesus, but I'd rather sit in my office and make money than  go around.  Of course.  I apologize for him mucking up your cross. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  All right, thanks.  Tell me not.  Have a good one, guys.  I'm sorry, he got blood on your funny hat.  Yeah.  Yo, I'm sorry, your in-ray sign got a nail in it.  I want to apologize.  I was watching a program last night, actually a DVD, and it just goes with the corporate  thing that we were talking about.  Seinfeld.  Watching Seinfeld, and they have a great behind-the-scenes kind of documentary on how the whole  thing started, and how Jerry and Larry David got together, and how NBC, how they had to 
[00:50:00]  deal with NBC, and how Larry David, as executive producer, was pretty much castrated on the  pilot episode.  And even talking after the show was completely done with and over, and they made these documentaries,  you see these people like Warren Littlefield and stuff from NBC talking, and I was looking  just going, these are the corporate idiots that ruin everything.  Like, they stood behind the show just enough to keep it going, but none of them understood 
[00:50:30]  it.  They have them literally saying, and I watched it, and I just didn't get it.  I read the script, and they're like, I didn't understand, like, what was funny about people  waiting to get a seat in a Chinese restaurant.  Like, I just don't get it.  And they still, after reading it, watching, they still didn't understand why it was funny.  And those are the people that were trying to make changes in the show. 
[00:51:00]  So, changes that Larry David didn't want to make, or Jerry didn't want to make, but  they, as executives, thought they knew best.  Right, and that's why they should just stay the fuck upstairs.  And they finally did.  They finally left them alone and went, look, alright, do whatever show you want to do.  And it turned out to be the biggest sitcom ever.  Well, but let me take what you said.  Okay, so Seinfeld was able to survive in that environment.  The problem is, there's a lot of other guys that aren't able to survive.  A lot of other shows that probably would have been much better, and they weren't able 
[00:51:30]  to survive that process.  But you know what they did?  And that's what's scary, and that's what the real problem is here.  You know what made them survive?  Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David pretty much said, if this don't work, let's just go back  to stand-up, fuck it.  And Larry David was like, I, he goes, I'm not going to put up with this crap.  I'm not going to do this.  And they were completely ready, willing, and able to walk the fuck away.  Anyway, that's when you have your power, when you can just fucking say, fuck you.  When you're not bluffing. 
[00:52:00]  When Seinfeld, by then, I saw recently a Tonight Show clip with Johnny of Seinfeld, back in  1990.  That's the one from 81.  But that's what I'm saying.  That's amazing.  He had already been on the Tonight Show for 10 years back.  Seinfeld was already a name, so he would have had a great career either way, not quite  the career he has, but he, at that point, probably was ready to walk.  Yeah, he could make his own rules about that.  If it wasn't, right, if he wasn't going to get to do the show he wanted to do, they  weren't, they just weren't going to do it.  Right.  It's people who are not, people who, like, a lot of the executives don't have a lot of 
[00:52:30]  funny experience.  No.  And years ago, the guys that were making shows, like Norman Lear, they were funny dudes.  Funny guys.  They're not funny guys anymore.  They all came from that old school, Carl Reiner.  Yes.  That whole group.  And they're not, they're not funny.  They're bean counters that think they know because the last successful show was this,  this, and this.  So the next one has to be the exact same thing.  Like they were saying, this, this doesn't have a story. 
[00:53:00]  It doesn't have a beginning, a middle, and an end to it.  Because they can't think out of the box.  It's three people hanging out in a restaurant waiting for a table.  What?  What?  They can't think out of the box.  Right.  They wanted a sitcom just like all the other sitcoms that came before.  Just like the other ones.  Exactly.  Cheers.  And it would have sucked.  Whatever.  The rest of them.  Yep.  What was it going to, oh yeah, I had a thought that goes along with this.  Ooh.  Executives sucking A.  No.  Horse cum.  Oh, fuck.  I lost it.  It was good too.  It's nice to hear that they kept it on though.  Like MASH.  The only thing that MASH survived is because the president of CBS's wife liked it and would 
[00:53:30]  talk to him in bed.  Right.  I believe about how good the show was.  Suck his dick.  I'm sure it didn't hurt.  This was my thought.  Imagine all in the family, and I'll just go with the honey motors.  Make it easy.  Two shows.  Imagine if they came out today, what they would look like on TV.  Oh, it would be a...  Imagine what they would look like on TV.  Seriously.  Disastrous.  It would not even be...  It wouldn't resemble the show.  And I'm sure there's a guy out there right now that has a all in the family type show or 
[00:54:00]  a honeymooners type show that'll never get off the ground.  Yeah.  And that's what I'm talking about.  Seinfeld was able to survive that, but a lot of guys just can't, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Really smart, creative guys that will never get their projects on TV.  Never.  There was another 15-minute documentary I watched yesterday on race in television, and it was  hosted by...  God, who is that woman?  The old woman from Tinseltown.  Hi, I'm fucking...  Rona Barrett. 
[00:54:30]  Holy shit.  And so it's an old-ass show.  I went with Olga Corbett today, and you just went with Rona fucking Barrett.  And they showed old clips from, like, old black shows.  And, like, Julia, I guess, was one.  And they would just be like, you know, hey, look, it's a colored woman.  Hey, a colored...  And they just talked.  It was like, you can't even get away with that shit now.  You're colored?  Can we find one of those? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, it was great.  Well, it was...  I accessed it from a site you probably shouldn't go to.  But I finally got there.  It's some kind of...  I think it's like a JimCrow.org or something.  I don't even know.  But they showed a bunch of shit.  Those .orgs are scary.  Oh, you gotta watch those .orgs.  Let's get back to the horse cum.  Apple-infused horse semen being served at this festival.  Food and fucking beer festival.  Okay.  Julia.  What?  The delicacy does not come cheap.  You want to guess how much?  For a shot?  Mm-hmm.  Mm. 
[00:55:30]  A shot of horse cum.  How much would I pay?  $10,000.  Actually, it's a little weird.  Because at a cost of $300 for 20 vials of semen.  20 vials?  So they're going to some fucking horse farm and getting 20 vials of semen for $300 a pop.  And then they make the shots out of it.  Wow.  Now, how long does the horse cum?  Do you have to mule it up your ass when you leave the farm?  Yeah.  And plus, how many...  You go to buy 20 and there's only 15 when you get back?  Yeah, I was thirsty.  It was hot in the bus.  It was a long ride. 
[00:56:00]  I got hot in the back of the bus.  I drank a little chilled horse semen.  I was laughing.  Behaving like Dean Martin on the bus.  Laughing with everybody.  Clinking glasses.  Martini glass full of horse cum.  Yeah.  Everybody's singing little bus songs.  You're guzzling horse cum.  99 bottles of horse cum on the wall.  99 vials of cum.  If one of those bottles should happen to get drunk.  How many bottles of delicious horse cum on the wall?  Yes. 
[00:56:30]  Two bottles of horse cum in my beard.  No repeat customers for the drink.  Really?  One and done for these people.  How much is he shot?  I don't think anyone's...  I don't know.  I don't think anyone's had a particular taste for it.  No one's addicted to it.  Let's put it that way.  Addicted.  Get it?  Damn.  So there you go.  That's...  God, can we get some horse semen for the show?  And apple infuse it?  Try. 
[00:57:00]  Could you ask at least?  Yeah, of course.  That would be a bit we would have done at NAW.  Oh, in a second.  Without even asking anybody, by the way.  I'm going to take a...  Would we even ask somebody?  At the drop of a horse cock.  We wouldn't ask anyone.  We would just do it.  No, never.  We'd have the horse in there.  Get some horse cum for the show.  We can't get interns.  We're going to get horse cum?  Can we just get horse cum and look at it?  Just to look at it in a snow globe.  Or smell it.  How about you open the violence and smell it?  Wouldn't you smell it? 
[00:57:30]  No!  I just want horse cum in a beaker today.  So badly.  I just want a beaker filled right to the tippy top with horse cum.  And we just put it on our counter.  Right to the tippity top.  And just watch it.  Oh, you smell that.  So, wait.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Your lower jaw.  When I said smell that, my lower jaw got like a creepy feeling.  Yeah, I'm getting like chills.  That raw animal cum smell.  I'll bet you the cream rises to the top, too.  It probably separates.  You think it curdles? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, you got me there.  Yeah.  It's probably thicker semen on top and like the fluid that pushes the semen at the bottom.  Yeah, fluid.  It's very viscous-y.  And it will get stuck in your teeth.  But, you know, horse cum, it is good to brush your teeth with, which I've been doing for a while.  Make my wine out of it.  You think it has the consistency of a jellyfish?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Just like custard.  You know what it sucks?  You probably take like one sip of horse cum and you're going to put it down. 
[00:58:30]  But like snot or egg, it's one long piece like an oyster.  You can't stop it.  Like an oyster, yeah.  Oh, I can't even think of it.  So getting back to your puking thing that you saw on TV.  Yeah.  It brings back the memory of when I talk about the best shows we've ever done.  Mm-hmm.  And someday I'm going to come up with the ultimate top ten shows I thought we've done.  Oh, top ten.  And one of them that would absolutely make that list would be the Super Bowl tickets fucking 
[00:59:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  New England clam chowder bit we did at BCN on regular radio.  Crazy.  Where it was guys eating clam chowder until they puked.  And then taking it to a whole new level.  And then we discovered that we had another pair of tickets.  And then we decided that the first guy that was able to keep down a tablespoon of the puked up clam chowder  would win the second pair of Super Bowl tickets.  We did this on regular radio, by the way, without even asking anybody. 
[00:59:30]  They just said, yeah, that sounds fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the amazement of how much puking that went on that day in that studio.  You remember.  It reeked.  First of all.  The whole studio reeked of vomit.  The original contestants, most of them puke.  Yeah.  And they all had to puke into a bucket to keep it safe.  And then we decided, okay, first guy to be able to hold down one tablespoon, I think it was,  of this puked up clam chowder would win the other pair of tickets.  And no one could do it because they continued to puke back into the barrel. 
[01:00:00]  Get a heaping help and get a good one.  Yeah.  So obviously we can't do that on satellite radio, right?  Oh, no.  I can't even think about it.  It's so disgusting.  Wait, the same day that we did Baby Bird was the same day we did the bowl of puked up  Froot Loops?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, man, was that pushed aside.  Oh, yeah.  It was Captain.  Wasn't that Captain Magoo?  Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo.  Okay.  He's coming back to me.  Puked up Froot Loops. 
[01:00:30]  He was supposed to be the big star that day.  Yeah.  He got.  I forgot all about this until you just said it.  He drank.  I got passed over.  That one fucking bothered me more than the puke because the thick.  I remember he was eating a piece of the Froot Loops.  Yeah.  And it was like a big, it was glue.  It was almost like glue, but it was puke glue.  We had Froot Loops.  That was Terrestrial Radio.  Yeah.  We had Froot Loops.  And as the guys were puking, Sergeant Magoo filled up his Froot Loops bowl with the puked  up eggnog.  And then ate that.  He was supposed to be the star that day.  Yeah.  He got trumped by Pat from Menarche.  Certainly did. 
[01:01:00]  Thanks to Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that certainly would be in my top ten list of ultimate shows we've done.  That's a good one.  And unfortunately, another puking show.  Great one.  Yeah.  Puking show.  But what are you going to do?  We can play that, by the way.  We can play it.  But we have to comment about it?  No.  No.  Oh, good.  We can.  All right.  So we had a victory.  A victory.  We can play something we did five years ago on the radio.  What a victory.  Our victories are very few and far between.  That's why I said we have a victory, and I laughed, because that's exactly what they'll 
[01:01:30]  tell us down the hall, that they did something.  Hey, guys.  Come on, guys.  We got a little victory.  Look what we got for you.  Yeah.  You can now play the same stuff you could on a regular radio a couple years ago.  Yeah.  All right.  Oof.  Prices for a dose of horse semen range from $500 to $2,700.  What?  For the shots?  Depends on what horses come.  That's for artificial insemination.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  So $500 is like an old nag, and $2,700 is probably pretty good, like a thoroughbred.  But I wonder, like, a Kentucky Derby winner.  Oh, that's probably a lot. 
[01:02:00]  How much for some of his come?  Could you go back to the we're making progress list?  Good come.  Yes.  We got a new one to add today.  Solutions, by the way.  I'm going with solutions now.  Solutions.  I don't want to be always the negative Nancy, so I want solutions on top of the bitchin'.  And we're giving out a lot of solutions today.  So is this a list of solutions or a list of things that are being sent upstairs?  No, I've heard that we're making progress on this one.  Making progress on.  And it's coming in a shitload that, once again, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:02:30]  Don't say the online feed's out.  The online feed is down.  Ah, well, that's things that are being worked on.  It's all right.  I got to say.  XM ampoule load.  Online feed for the iPhone is down and only on the virus.  Only on the virus it happens to.  iPhone feed is down.  Hey, when the fuck are you guys going to fix the online feed?  Should I continue?  This fucking...  Whoever does the internet for the online feed here, whoever does this stinks at their job  and should be fired.  Yeah.  It is happening too much to people who are paying for the fucking service. 
[01:03:00]  And only our show.  So obviously there's some kind of agenda there.  Or they just really stink at what they do.  They must stink.  It's either on purpose or you stink.  Well, they tell me it's like isolated or something.  I don't know.  How is it isolated only to this channel, though?  I don't get it.  How does it happen?  It doesn't happen as much as people are saying.  They're just saying that for no reason.  All at the same time.  I don't know.  All at the same time.  Yeah.  That's great when all of a sudden the Twitter blows up with people just going, 
[01:03:30]  online feed's out, online feed's out.  Wouldn't you like them to like that part of the service?  As a satellite, wouldn't you want that to work so they can enjoy the satellite radio features  even when they're not in their car?  Yes.  It's happening on different phones and a guy, Vince, who's definitely reliable.  Vince from Bayonne.  I know a lot of these guys are assholes.  Yeah, that queer is reliable.  Vince is very reliable.  He says, oh, fuck, it's coming in so much I just lost his.  I can hear the feed on my PC. 
[01:04:00]  I'm checking.  No, I know.  What is that station that you have on?  Web feed is now up.  Online feed is working here.  Okay.  I want to apologize to your iPod.  We're seeing it for the show.  There it is.  It's working.  Okay.  Is that from yesterday?  Can we just listen?  It's the apple-infused horse team and you just were talking about it.  Wow.  How fucking much of a delay is this?  The drop of a horse cock.  Wow.  Wow.  I need to get my...  Can we just listen to the show?  Yeah, I want to listen to hear how we did.  I want to listen to the show.  Horse come for the show. 
[01:04:30]  I can't get interns.  We're going to get horse come.  Can we just get horse come and look at it?  Just to look at it.  This is old.  Fuck, we're funny.  How about you open the violence?  It's pretty entertaining.  This is like a best of.  Wouldn't you smell it?  No.  I just want horse come in a beaker today.  So badly.  I just want a beaker filled right to the tippy top with horse come.  Why would you say that?  That could be taken out of context.  Yes, that could be.  I hope we marked that.  Oh, you smell that.  So, wait.  Oh, gotcha.  Your lower jaw. 
[01:05:00]  We're making them listen to the same.  Yeah, I like it.  Yeah, I'm getting chills.  Like, that raw animal cum smell.  I'll bet you the cream rises to the top, too.  It probably separates.  Wait a minute.  That's a hell of a delay, huh?  Anthony.  Yeah.  This was an hour and a half ago.  Wouldn't this be like looking in a mirror, though?  If he kept the phone up, wouldn't it just continue now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It would, right?  It would loop.  It would loop around.  I mean, I'd have to do it for like 10 minutes.  Wait, what would happen?  It would go back to that. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, and you'd have to do that.  This would be on there in about slightly worse quality each time it went around because it's  analog playing it through the microphone.  Because then we would be listening to the feed, and then what happens after that?  I'm trying to figure this out in my head.  You know what I'm trying to say?  Oh, if he put it there, he could hold it there all day, and it would just keep going  around and around.  But we stopped doing a show.  Yeah, but the sound is going into the mic from that, so it would just keep going.  Right, because it's from the mic. 
[01:06:00]  It's not like this.  It brings back the memory of when I talk about the best shows we've ever done.  But when would it end?  That's what I'm trying to say.  10 o'clock.  How long is that delay?  It's pretty long.  Why is it so long?  That's where it is online.  Oh, you'd hear it over and over and over, so it would become this blah, blah, blah, blah,  just mess of...  Are you sure?  Yeah.  But why is it so long it would delay online?  Well, it's with the...  I don't know.  The computer.  We did it.  Now we're listening to it on the app.  We hold the app up to the microphone. 
[01:06:30]  Because at some point, it would kick in, and he's still playing it.  I'm really confused.  I'm going to have to work this out in my head.  You would just keep hearing it.  What, though?  What would we be hearing?  If we stopped talking, is what I'm saying.  If we stopped talking right now, what would happen to this?  The show would improve.  It's like a row, row, row, you're both thing.  See, I go row, row, row, you're both gently down the stream, and then you go row, row, row,  and I keep going row, row, row, you're both, and then he goes in, and it would just keep 
[01:07:00]  doing that.  Yeah, but I would probably jump in with merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.  You would do a merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.  Yeah.  Life is but a dream.  Go back up to the end.  Love singing that into a vagina.  It's been a good one.  Yeah.  So, obviously, we can't do that on satellite radio, right?  But the delay is so long.  I can't even think of them out, and it's so disgusting.  We did this ten minutes ago. 
[01:07:30]  The same day that we did Baby Bird was the same day we did the bowl of puked-up Froot Loops?  Yeah.  Oh, man, was that pushed aside.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't work.  We're very conversational.  Oh, I like this.  Yeah?  I haven't heard of our show in a long time.  It would be easier for us to call the show and then hold it up, because then the delay  is shorter, and we can see what would happen.  All right.  We should take a break, I guess.  Yeah?  Oh, what is this?  What's this?  Why are they giving us this role?  Are we getting any one of these people?  Are we getting Matt Damon?  Thanks.  Are we getting Emily Blunt? 
[01:08:00]  Are we getting Matt Damon?  Yeah.  How about Emily to the point?  Are we getting Emily Blunt?  How about Emily tells it like it is?  Let me ask.  How about Emily joint in Philly?  All right.  I, uh...  Isn't this Bourne Identity?  I saw this already.  Is it good, Ant?  Thanks to Joe Rowland.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Is it good, Rowland?  Fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  What am I getting Elijah Woodshare today?  I saw it.  The Adjustment Bureau.  See, there's some kind of weird behind-the-scenes organization that keeps everyone in line. 
[01:08:30]  Almost like a Matrix-y thing.  And, uh, and, uh, Matt Damon wants to be with Emily Blunt, but the architects of this thing  say that they're not supposed to be together, and then the whole movie is them trying to  be together and him trying to find out what these people are, and oh, man, it's action  and intrigue.  I bet there's some kind of a very clever message about our government in there. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Not, of course.  No.  The thought, the thought control by people on Matt Damon's side of the spectrum.  You'll...  No!  Nothing about the thought policing done by them.  No!  You'll have to watch it, Jim.  Am I wrong?  Maybe...  I hope I am, actually.  Of course you're not.  But I'll bet there's a message in there.  A message.  Yeah.  I like a movie without a good message.  Did Matt Damon sit somebody down and say, look, I want to be completely boring, what 
[01:09:30]  do I do?  He's a good actor, man.  That came naturally.  I think he's a very good actor, but he's all right.  I like his work.  I mean, I think he's a little overrated.  Maybe.  But I do enjoy watching him on film.  But he's become so predictably agenda-driven, it's annoying.  What happened to Ben Affleck?  Where has he been?  He did The Town.  He directed The Town.  Yeah, yeah.  That was, you know, that's yesterday's news.  Well, how long ago was The Town?  The Town was an amazing movie. 
[01:10:00]  Two years?  I liked The Town.  I loved The Town.  He's probably working on a new project.  What's he working on now?  What?  Political Office?  Roll it, really?  How about he just continues making movies?  That's what he does.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Where are we on the online feed?  Online, it should be fine.  Are we now listening to ourselves on the online feed yet?  Almost.  You ready?  Yeah.  You ready?  They just really stink at what they do.  They must stink.  It's either on purpose, or you should...  Because you guys are talking about The Feed right now, so you're about to play The Feed.  Wow. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  They don't like this channel, though.  I don't get it.  How does it happen?  Now we're going to see what happens.  Remember this?  I think you're just going to hear it.  What are we going to hear, though, now?  I don't know.  All at the same time.  Yeah.  That's great when all of a sudden Twitter blows up with people just going...  You remember saying that?  I remember saying that.  Barely.  I barely remember.  That's just on the edge of my short-term memory.  Yeah.  Hi, yeah.  It's happening on different phones, and a guy, Vince, who's definitely reliable. 
[01:11:00]  Vince was reliable, remember?  I remember saying that.  Watch, watch.  It moves too fast.  Vince is very reliable.  He says...  Watch.  Feedback.  Oh, fuck.  It's coming in so much.  See?  I'm like Kreskin.  Damn, that was good.  I can hear the feed on my PC.  All right.  Here's Seth.  The gay...  What is that station that you have on?  It's Cosmo.  The gay music.  I want to apologize to you all.  Ha-ha, pod.  There it is.  It's working.  Okay.  Can you ask me, at least?  Is that from yesterday? 
[01:11:30]  Can we just say apple-infused horse semen?  Did you just talk to me about it?  Did we hear us and us talking?  Fucking much of a delay is this.  There's a lot of voices now going on.  Is there three versions of us now?  Yeah, I think there are three versions.  One more mediocre than the other.  There's a lot of us.  Wait, we got current, past, and present right now.  This is old.  That's amazing.  We have right now...  Did we just clone ourselves?  The past. 
[01:12:00]  We can just walk out of here and let that play.  We might as well.  They'll never know.  They'll never notice.  The redundancy is what we do every day.  Horse come, farts.  I'm going to say farts quickly.  Management sucks.  Horse come, farts.  Repeat.  How does anybody know which version is the current us anymore?  It's our loss.  Now.  It's now.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the real one.  Isn't this the plot of multiplicity?  Yes.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  No, that's my old son.  I was talking to the old you.  That's the old me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now we're asking what would happen, but we're living through what would happen right now.  It would go back to...  You already said this.  And then you hear us in the background also.  That slightly worse quality each time it went around.  How did you know that?  I knew that, see?  But how does it end?  It never does.  It just keeps piling up on top.  When it comes around again, we'll hear this very thing that I'm saying right now. 
[01:13:00]  You hear this?  Yeah.  But the quality isn't going to be as good.  Because listen, listen.  Hi, hi, how you doing?  See, the quality isn't what it was when I first said it.  Fudge.  All right, let's listen for a second.  The memory of when I talk about the best shows we've ever done.  But when would it end?  That's what I'm trying to say.  When did it clock?  How long is I delay?  Is this now?  No.  This is then.  What are we listening to?  We're listening to three versions of the show. 
[01:13:30]  No, but right now, I mean, what's happening now?  This.  This is the past.  Yeah, that's the past.  What's the past?  Where is the present?  Now, we're listening to it on the app.  We hold the app up to the microphone.  But if I say this and listen to it later, this is the future.  At some point.  But then that's the past.  It would kick in, and he's still playing it.  I'm really confused.  It's amazing.  We think we have this amazing loop, and people are just looking at it like you guys stink.  If we stop talking is what I'm saying.  Yabba, dabba, do. 
[01:14:00]  If we stop talking right now, what would happen to this?  Show it improve.  That's right, Pat.  I remember when Jimmy said that.  It was funny then, it's funny now, it's going to be funny again.  Did he say that a long time ago, or a little while ago?  A while ago, or?  No, no, that wasn't the long time ago.  It was the medium time ago.  It was two versions ago.  Yeah.  Two versions ago?  Yes.  By the time they hear this again.  Then it's the older version.  This is getting weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Life is but a dream.  Why would I sing that?  I love singing that into a vagina. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know.  Into a vagina.  You come up with that.  You're hilarious.  I like your songs.  I can't eat.  Wait, what are we doing now?  That's so disgusting.  Where's it come?  The day that we did Baby Bird was the same.  Yeah, sick.  The day we did the bowl of Puked Up Froot Loops?  Yeah.  Oh, man, was that pushed aside.  See?  That doesn't work.  We're very conversational.  I like this.  Oh, my God.  This is weird.  I meant when you said that. 
[01:15:00]  I just wanted to sound like Grand Central Station.  I just heard the door shut, but the door didn't shut.  I know.  That's creepy.  Oh, that is creepy.  What is this?  Why are they giving us...  How much longer before it goes back to the beginning again?  Are we getting...  Oh, okay.  Is that what's going to happen?  Roland's bringing in the DVDs now.  But he already did that.  I got the DVD in front of me.  But I can't hear the original anymore, really.  Well...  Is this Bourne Identity?  I saw this already.  What original?  Is it good at?  I had turned off the... 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, thanks to Joe Rogan.  Oh, boy.  Is it good, Roland?  Wait.  Because we're about to start the loop again.  We're thanking Joe Rogan for the Blu-ray that Roland brought in?  No, that was thanking him for Baby Bird.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a weird behind-the-scenes organization that keeps everyone in line.  Almost like a Matrix-y thing.  I remember saying this.  Yep, me too.  And Matt Damon...  Are we getting close to the beginning again?  Yeah, we're about to start the loop again.  Are we?  Yeah, let's listen to the loop again. 
[01:16:00]  No way.  I don't want to.  And then we'll finally move on.  Trying to be together and him trying to find out what these people are.  Because remember, you talked about the movie, and then you said, where are you in the  stream?  And I said, almost there.  I never said that.  Someone added that in.  Oh, my God.  One of me said that.  And not, of course, the thought control by people on Matt Damon's side of the spectrum.  No!  Remember this?  I do, unfortunately.  Vividly.  No!  Right?  At least we know the online stream's working. 
[01:16:30]  Am I wrong?  Yeah.  I hope I am, actually.  They'll think it's working, like, over and over again, though.  They'll think there's a problem with it.  Just blame it on E-Roc.  Okay.  E-Roc played the replay over the replay.  Right.  What do I do?  He's a good actor.  I could eat, and it doesn't matter now, because I'm talking.  It's like five minutes of content stretched out to 20.  Yeah, that's what we try to do here.  But I do enjoy watching him on film.  But he's become so predictably agenda-driven. 
[01:17:00]  Predictably agenda-driven.  You're right, Jim.  I don't remember Jimmy saying this, so this is funny.  Oh, I know.  I missed this part of the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was, you know, that's yesterday's news.  Well, how long ago was the town?  The town was an amazing news.  Two years?  I liked the town.  I loved it.  He's probably working on that.  You know what we're talking about?  What?  Matt Daniel Benafel.  The Columbus rolling, really?  How about he just continues making movies?  That's what he does.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Are we coming around?  Where are we on the online feed?  Online.  Should we find out?  Oh, are you listening? 
[01:17:30]  I'm sorry, sorry.  Are we now listening to ourselves on the online feed yet?  Almost.  You ready?  Yeah.  You ready?  What the fuck is this?  They just really stink at what they do.  They must stink.  Oh, God.  We're about to go four levels deep.  Wow.  Really?  Four levels deep.  This is like some Inception shit.  We shouldn't be going this deep.  We shouldn't.  No, we got to go.  It's dangerous.  You can start hearing the quality of the difference. 
[01:18:00]  I said that.  I barely remember.  That's just on the edge of my short-term memory.  Yeah.  Hi, yeah.  Satellite radio features when they're not in their coordinates.  Oh, my God.  It's happening on different phones and a guy, Vince, who's definitely reliable.  He's reliable.  Remember?  I'm never saying that.  Watch, watch.  It moves too fast.  This is reliable.  Wait, who said that?  Watch.  Be back.  Oh, fuck.  It's coming in so much.  How did you know that?  I just said it.  Damn.  That was good.  I can hear the feed on my PC.  Oh, my God.  There's the Cosmo station again.  Wait, what is that station? 
[01:18:30]  Wait, how long?  It's Cosmo.  What?  What?  I want to apologize to your iPod.  We're done talking about Tracy Morgan.  We're done.  What happened?  There it is.  It's working.  Okay, there's the four.  Can you ask me, please?  Is that from yesterday?  Can we just listen to one fuse?  Can we just talk to one minute?  Can we hear us and us talk?  Oh, my God.  This is the drop of a horse car.  What's going on?  Oh, wow.  I need to go.  I need to go.  I need to go.  I need to go.  I need to go.  I need to go.  Is there three versions of us now?  One more mediocre than the other. 
[01:19:00]  There's a lot of us.  Wait, we got current.  Can we just ask him?  Yeah.  I need to go.  This is a snow cone.  We're so amazing.  That's the queef.  Calling this Deja Boo.  Very funny.  We have to talk over this to add the fourth line.  Yeah, we do.  That's true.  I want to hear what it sounds like so far, then.  How does anybody know which version is the link for us anymore? 
[01:19:30]  That's what I hear in my head all day.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the real one.  No, this is the real one.  No, no.  Now's real.  Which one's real?  Now is.  Then one.  Yeah.  No, that's my old son.  I was talking to the old you.  Oh, my gosh.  Mm-hmm.  Before you're asking again.  Now we're asking what would happen.  But we're living through what would happen right now.  Are we going to get paid for today?  We shouldn't.  I don't think we should.  Maybe you get paid quadruple. 
[01:20:00]  That's a good idea.  Yeah, man.  I got four versions of myself out there now.  Yeah.  That's four days of work.  I knew that, see?  But how does it end?  Then we would be listening.  It never does.  It just keeps piling up on top.  When it comes around again,  we'll hear this very thing that's happening.  You were right.  You hear this?  Yeah.  But the quality isn't going to be as good.  Because listen, listen.  Hi, hi.  How you doing?  See, the quality isn't what it was like.  Not like this quality right now, which is good. 
[01:20:30]  But it's not anymore.  No, now it won't be.  Right.  When will it end?  That's what I'm trying to say.  Come on.  Where are you at?  How long is that delay?  Is it now?  Oh, my God.  This could be the most annoying thing we've ever done on the air.  Maybe.  Ever.  All right.  Fine.  It was a curiosity.  Yeah, that's the past.  That's weird.  It was a curiosity.  Did you hear how it sounded?  Thank you, Sam.  I guess the online feud's working.  Definitely.  You sure?  Oh, yeah.  You sure? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I can hear it.  All right.  Put that back up to the mic.  We're going to go to break.  Talk to rioters.  Scars.  We're going to listen to this for 30 seconds, and we're going to go to break.  Yeah.  And we'll continue.  Stay there.  Can we stop talking?  Dabba, Dabba, do.  Right now, what would happen to this?  Show it in truth.  That's right, Pat.  I remember when Jimmy said that.  It was funny then.  It's funny now.  It's going to be funny again.  Did he say that a long time ago or a little while ago?  A while ago or a little while ago.  No, no.  That wasn't a long time ago.  It was a medium time ago. 
[01:21:30]  It was two versions ago.  Yeah.  Two versions ago?  Yes.  By the time they hear this again.  Then it's the older version.  I'm going to do a merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.  This is getting weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Life is but a dream.  Why would I sing that?  I love singing that into a vagina.  I don't know.  Into a vagina.  Come up with me.  Now you're hilarious.  I like your songs.  I gotta eat.  Wait, what are we doing now?  That's so disgusting.  The day that we did Baby Bird was the same. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I see.  The day we did the bowl of Puked Up Froot Loops.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Was that pushed aside?  I see.  Captain of the world.  Captain.  We're very conversational.  I like this.  Sergeant of the world.  I don't know when they said that.  This is weird.  I don't know when they said that.  For us to call the show.  Yeah.  This is the Obedien 3 Show.  Uh, yeah, thanks.  Thanks to Adam in Rhode Island.  Yeah.  First radio show to time travel.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yes, it is pretty cool, sir. 
[01:22:30]  We did.  Literally time travel.  It was great.  We're the first at many things in this business.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Hey, Howard was bumming out and talking about us a little bit.  What happened?  Not in a bad way.  Everyone relax.  Not in a bad way.  Don't get your claws out.  It was pretty funny, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, because, um, Alex Bennett was trashing, um, what, Benji for interrupting the Wiener 
[01:23:00]  thing?  The Wiener, uh, press conference, yeah.  Turns out, um, another guy had a lot of shit on Wiener.  Supposedly, Wiener was hinting at running for, uh, for mayor.  Mayor.  Like a year ago?  New York.  And this one guy, a local, uh, New York politician guy said, look, I know what you're doing.  I know what you're about.  And if you do do that, I will expose you.  Did he blow him in gurney?  He blew him in gurney.  Fuck.  So he was, he was finished anyway.  I mean, he was not going to.  He blew him in gurney.  Powdered cocaine for him? 
[01:23:30]  Right.  And crack cocaine for the president.  For Mr. Wiener.  And for Mr. Wiener.  God hit the paper today.  Yeah.  It's in there if you want to read yourself.  So, unfortunately, this guy, I don't think he should have had a go.  I don't care what my politicians are doing.  But anyway, um, uh, Alex Bennett was all uptight that Howard's people interrupted the press conference.  Howard said, fuck that.  I'm going to go confront the guy.  He confronts Alex Bennett.  Alex Bennett just backs completely down.  And now Howard's bummed because he has no one to fight. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  And that's how we got brought into this.  It's not the, it's not that atmosphere anymore.  You know?  That's sort of what he says here.  Yeah?  I'm so sorry I went down there.  I apologize to all of you.  I could, I don't know.  I was like, you know, and, and we're down there trying, and I suggest the rest of you  trying.  He goes, okay.  John Hyde had to hit his insulin pump.  I apologize.  You weren't there.  If you were there, you'd see what I mean. 
[01:24:30]  There was nothing to fight about.  He didn't appear, appear to care at all.  He was not hanging his head in shame.  He wasn't upset.  And he even thanked me for bringing all the fans here.  Oh my goodness.  What are you going to do?  No.  You know, that's, that's the problem.  When you become a legend in the radio business, somebody wants to fight with you.  Oh my goodness.  Opie and Anthony would fight with me at least.  I don't know.  Maybe they wouldn't even.  I don't know.  There's somebody around here.  I don't know if you could get a fight. 
[01:25:00]  You know what?  What's to fight about?  What's to fight about?  That's what it is.  I need to go to terrestrial radio and fight with people.  Anyway, I'm sorry for the disappointing non-fight.  I did.  I went over there with every intention of fighting with the guy and it just, it just, it just fizzled.  We can fight with Howard.  We can fight over something.  He's right though.  What do you want to fight over?  There's nothing to fight about anymore.  We're all in the same boat.  Let's fight.  What can we fight over around here?  We're all in the same boat with the vending machines? 
[01:25:30]  Fucking down the hall people.  It's just the same.  Well, we could.  We're all in the same boat.  We could join forces for the common cause.  There's no more radio battles to be fought.  Like, who gives a shit anymore about fighting?  How about this?  There was only one thing of strawberry Pop-Tarts and both shows wanted it.  Now, Jimmy, that's a great reason to fight. 
[01:26:00]  And we didn't want to split them because there was one Pop-Tart for us, one Pop-Tart for his show.  So we had to decide it through a blow-off in the men's room.  Well, we'll volunteer you to go in there and battle it out.  Because I couldn't think of a way to end it.  I know why.  The Jim Norton flow chart.  Molestation.  It all goes to molestation.  You know what the problem is?  We're all in the same building, right?  Yep.  And you take the ride up in the elevator every so often with these people. 
[01:26:30]  I walk.  Lazy.  Oh, well.  And you realize, you know what?  These people aren't really that bad.  They're just fun people that have to get up in an ungodly hour and do a radio show.  So if we get rid of the elevators, we can fight again.  I think the elevators are the cause that no one's fighting anymore.  Yeah.  We've all taken elevators together at this point.  Yeah.  I, um, every morning when I come in, a lot of times I go to swipe my card, but Ronnie 
[01:27:00]  is at the desk and he just lets me in.  Do you punch him?  I do.  I'm like, we're at war!  We're at war, let me in.  I gotta get to the war room.  No, I just, uh...  Are you in the war room every day?  Every day.  Um, a couple things before Anthony has to...  People go over to Vietnam now and they go into the tunnels and it's like a tourist attraction  now, Vietnam.  That was a pretty, uh, raw battlefield for a while, but now it's just like, eh, so what? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Who cares?  Kurt, Kurt Newton, Illinois, words hurt, sir.  Words hurt.  I said we're all in the same boat.  He says, uh, well, you're in a boat.  Howard's on a cruise ship.  That's true.  Okay, look, the boat size could be a little different.  There could be a disparity in boat size, but it's the same ocean.  We're in a dinghy.  We're just bailing out water all the time to keep from sinking.  You know that scene from Caddyshack? 
[01:28:00]  You got the black dude fishing in the little boat?  Yeah, that's it.  That's us.  Yeah.  And here comes Howard.  She's in a grin.  Here comes Howard, fucking...  Hey, that's my buddy.  Ooh.  Uh.  Uh, yeah.  The Rodney Dangerfield boat.  That's Howard.  Yeah.  What's something we could start a fight over, though?  I think Pop-Tarts is a good place to start, Jimmy.  Or elevator, fucking space.  If they're standing in our section of the elevator, that could be a problem.  How about every...  Okay, here's the deal.  I got a good way to get a fight started over nothing. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  But it's very annoying.  Okay, sir.  Any time we get into the elevator with anybody from the Stern crew, hit every button on the  elevator.  That's right.  And then get off on the very next floor.  Oh, shit.  On every...  No.  You got to kind of...  Okay.  Hit every button, and then on the way down, just talk about what we're doing on our show  and how we probably think it's better than what they're doing on their show.  All right, that might get a fight gone.  See, you guys were interviewing Ben Affleck, but we couldn't get him. 
[01:29:00]  So we talked about Travis, and then Bobo came in.  And it was so much better.  And we had horse calm, but we couldn't get horse calm because management doesn't let us.  Ding!  27.  Oh, God.  That would start a fight.  That would start a fight.  Yes.  Yeah, he's probably right.  How about...  I got an idea.  Yeah?  You know how they got that side of the building, and it's got the big glass door, but it's  covered with the big poster of the stern hand and everything? 
[01:29:30]  Get some dog shit.  Put it in a paper bag, right?  Oh, shit.  Put it in front of the door, and then light it on fire, and then knock, and we'll run around  the corner.  That's not a bad idea.  And it'll be like, oh, somebody...  Oh, geez, Robin, somebody lit a thing on fire.  Oh, it's dog shit, Robin.  How great would that be?  Ring and Runs.  Ring and Runs would be good.  We could just do it old school.  We'll kick it old school.  What about albums with baby powder? 
[01:30:00]  We could do that, too.  Right.  The baby powder.  Right under the door, and you stomp on the album cover.  Oh, they're going to be in a world of powder.  Oh, wow.  Is that an old trick?  Oh, that's a great one.  Oh, boy.  Is that a great one?  Do it with anthrax.  It works wonders.  Well, how about we send them something.  We say, open next to nose.  How about this?  Who is going to...  Wait a minute.  I have an idea.  Who would ever open a box that says, open next to nose?  No, no, no.  Next to nose.  How about we take an empty pill bottle, and we cut gassers into it, and we close it quickly, 
[01:30:30]  and then we say, open next to nose, so a fart wafts out.  And we go like, oh!  They got us.  We thought there might be rose petal scented things in here.  Boy, are we going to fight with them.  How about both shows blame the other show for stinking up the urinal cakes?  I like that one, too.  All these ideas could work.  That's kind of sad, actually.  You want to order a bunch of pizzas and send them over there? 
[01:31:00]  That'd be funny, man, right?  Who has no reason?  Wait, hold on.  I got a Prince Albert in a can idea.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  I wish they ran up bowling alley.  Love that one.  You got 10-pound balls?  How do you walk?  We used to do different ones.  We would call bowling alley and go, hey, what's up your alley or something, you know?  That work good?  Were people surprised?  Sure.  Anthony, a quick heads up. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  Sandy Kane, the naked cowgirl, is going to be on America's Got Talent tonight.  What?  I heard rumors, and it's true.  Wait, for what?  What is this?  She got a big fucking mention in an actual article in the paper today.  Oh, wait.  I'm looking at the Casey Anthony thing picture there.  Inside the Casey media column.  Right next to it, though, in the TV section of the New York Post.  Holy shit, that's a picture of that slob.  It says, naked cowgirl's talent.  She's going to be on America's Got Talent tonight. 
[01:32:00]  No, she's on America's Got Genital Warts.  America's Got AIDS.  They list her at being...  Guess how old she told the New York Post she is.  She's got 23.  Um, 161.  Give me that.  America's Got Osteoporosis.  I watch America's Got Talent.  America's Got Dementia.  Jesus Christ.  America's Got a Rotten Cunt. 
[01:32:30]  America's Got a Bad Wig.  Hopefully, America's Got Cancer and doesn't know it yet.  America's Got One Breast.  America's Gotten Rape by Richard Pryor and a bunch of other comedians, apparently.  What do they list her as?  How old?  58.  58?  She's 58.  Stop it.  She keeps saying she's 58 when she was on our show originally.  You sure that wasn't when she graduated high school? 
[01:33:00]  She's at least 68, right?  She has to be.  Has to be.  She is so pushing 70.  She's going to be a hit, though, man.  I'm telling you.  What is she doing?  This is perfect for America's Got Talent.  Is she going to sing?  Yeah, she's one of the goofs.  I'm going to do my song.  I'm going to do the song or something.  She's going to be one of the goof acts.  They do goof acts.  Do they do it?  Like the gong show when they come out?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But she's on tonight.  Big article on her in the paper today, so take a look.  Pat says she was 58 in 58. 
[01:33:30]  Get the audio of her performance tonight.  Did she tape it or was it live?  It's taped.  She did this a while ago.  Double D's, it says in the article, Legal Showdown, Special Song from the Cannon.  What?  Yeah.  Stars and Stripes Bikini.  Wow, you could read articles this way.  What?  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  Oh, yeah.  Look, I didn't have to read the whole article.  You're just kind of blurting out words. 
[01:34:00]  Is this like a reading thing?  Is this a reading thing?  You know what I mean?  Is this a technique for reading?  I think it is.  Yes.  Really?  Skimming, right?  Yeah, it's called How to Look at Something Yet Not Comprehend What It Says.  Just spit out random words.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  Words per minute.  Very high.  Comprehension.  Very low.  Watch.  I remember that as a kid.  Stars and Stripes Bikini.  Special Song for Nick Cannon.  58.  Double D's.  Legal Showdown. 
[01:34:30]  And that's it.  That's what I need to know.  The $25,000 pyramid.  Things associated with a retard.  Ant's got to go fight a ticket.  But before you leave Ant, really quickly.  Arrgh.  There's a great story about a perv switch.  Yeah, I heard about this.  We love the perv switch on this radio show.  I heard about this one.  We came up with the perv switch.  Although it's out there, but we finally named it.  We all have the perv switch inside us, but we kind of keep it under control for the most part.  Most people can keep it bottled up, no matter how turned on they get. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  And sometimes you want to do something ridiculous, but at the last moment you think to yourself,  what the fuck am I doing?  Yeah, I'm going to ruin everything.  It says perv EMT copped a feel.  A perverted city EMT groped an injured woman while rushing her to a Staten Island hospital  and later called and texted the victim to set up a date.  Well, David Taranto, 31, ambulance guy, FDNY ambulance guy, responded to a car accident 
[01:35:30]  that involved a 39-year-old victim.  On the way to the Staten Island University Hospital, this guy picked up a stethoscope to check her heart rate,  and then, because you're right there, he allegedly grabbed her breast under her clothes.  Oh, my God.  I licked my sweaty balls.  The creep told her that she had an amazing body. 
[01:36:00]  You will be molested.  And waited with her for three hours at the hospital.  Yeah.  Wouldn't leave her side.  She seemed horrified by it.  How delusional.  He allegedly also phoned and texted the victim to invite her to his house.  The horrified woman called police who arrested Taranto on Monday and charged him with sexual abuse.  Stop talking and start sucking.  You are never to blame.  He was released on $1,000 bail. 
[01:36:30]  That's it?  Yep.  He cupped her tit.  Under the clothes.  Under the clothes.  He cupped her titty and put the stethoscope there to listen to her heart.  And then, yeah, took her phone and started calling her.  Yeah, that guy just saw something.  He was like, holy shit.  That perv switch is...  I've got to feel those tits!  Yeah, is she okay?  Yeah, put a neck brace on her. 
[01:37:00]  Get her in the back of the ambulance.  We've got to take her down.  You okay, miss?  Yeah, I'm just going to listen to your heart.  I'm going to...  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, I've got to open your shirt a little.  I've got to feel those tits!  And he cupped it.  He cupped it.  Just to feel the heaviness.  The heaviness.  The weightiness.  Ka-chum, ka-chum, ka-chum, ka-chum, ka-chum, ka-chum.  And she didn't object.  No.  While she was probably worried about dying in the ambulance. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You want to hear something really hot?  She was 10.  I was.  Oh, God.  Want to hear something really hot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny's giving you...  That's Kenny's OCD.  It's 8 o'clock and he's still in studio.  Get out!  Really quickly.  Yeah.  Observation.  Sheet Meadow.  For the locals.  Yeah.  You want to see some hot girls go to Sheet Meadow.  During the day, what they do is they take their lunch breaks to Sheet Meadow and they're 
[01:38:00]  like, oh my God, it's a beautiful sunny day here in New York and I want to get a little  tan during my lunch hour.  So then they strip down to lingerie.  And they make believe they just happen to have that lingerie on for the day.  But they planned it ahead of time before they went to work.  Is it like just a bikini top kind of a thing?  They go all the way down, some of them.  Oh, man.  Bron panties.  Where are these?  And they're just laying in Sheet Meadow.  Why aren't there pictures, like online?  That's a really good question.  Honestly, I've pulled out my camera, but then I feel like a fucking pervert. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  So I got to figure out how to film that shit.  Covert.  You need those glasses.  Well, I'm getting them.  Yeah.  Get those glasses.  I got mine on order.  Sheep Meadow Tanning.  Google Images.  Yeah.  Do they have anything?  Do they have anything?  I see real sheep there.  What the fuck is that?  Well, that's why it was...  Oh, it was a Sheep Meadow.  Yeah.  That's the name.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  There's a man.  That's wonderful.  That's exactly...  See? 
[01:39:00]  See, I could be the guy...  No, I'm out.  Just go.  I could be the guy that freaking has the cool hot Sheep Meadow Tanning pics.  I lied.  I had it.  Good luck.  Are you going to get in trouble for leaving early today?  No.  I gave him two weeks notice on this one.  Oh, good.  Two fucking weeks notice.  Language.  Congratulations to you.  Yeah.  Have fun, kids.  All right, buddy.  I'll see you more.  We got...  What is...  He's finding a ticket?  He is, yes.  That one.  Well, Tom Pop is here. 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  So why don't we take another break because we're really late.  Yes.  We'll take a break.  We got Tom Pop in here.  Me and Jimmy and Tom will continue.  Yes.  What the hell, man?  We could do this, I think.  I hope so.  I think we could do this, Jimmy.  If we can't, we should have our tongues removed.  We got Michael Potts at 9 o'clock, which I'm actually...  Book of Mormon and Brother...  Brother Mazzone on The Wire.  Mazzone from The Wire.  I had no idea that he was in The Wire.  But the whole time, I'm looking at that guy going, I know him from somewhere, but he  didn't have his glasses on.  That's what threw me off.  Yeah, I knew his name. 
[01:40:00]  Talented guy.  If he's in Book of Mormon and he did The Wire, that's two very different roles.  Yes.  So, all right.  Stay there.  We got Tom Pop in studio.  Good morning.  How are you, Tom?  I'm doing well.  Tom asked me how I'm doing, and I had to say, not so well today.  I get kind of like a sore throat, achy, low-level fever, a dry cough.  Jesus.  Yeah, and it's because I took my kid to the kid doctor to get some shots. 
[01:40:30]  Every time we go there, we come home and we get sick.  It's the worst.  What good are they?  Kids?  Well...  What good are these fucking kid doctors?  The worst.  Yeah, I intentionally don't bring them to the doctors until they're really...  You have to scrape them up off the floor.  Right.  Just because of that.  They're going to get more sick.  You're going to get sick.  But I have no choice.  He has to get his shots.  Oh, it's the shots thing.  Yeah, and then...  So he wasn't even sick.  No, but now he is.  And so am I this time. 
[01:41:00]  We both got sick this time.  We were completely healthy, enjoying each other.  And now we're both looking at each other miserable, like, what the fuck?  Oh, it's the worst.  And you go there.  I told you there's a room for sick and a room for non-sick.  They're trying to do the right thing.  So if you're coming in with a healthy kid that just needs shots, you go to the non-sick  room.  Right.  But everyone, all they do is think about themselves, including myself, by the way.  Yeah, but you should.  And you go into the non-sick room if you're sick, because you don't want to get sicker.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Right?  Yeah.  People will come in and be like, oh, but we're not sick like those people are sick.  Right.  I don't want to get what they have.  No.  I know I'm sick already, but that kid looks really bad.  So I'm going to go into the non-sick room, even though I'm sick.  And then the kids grab, take their snotty hands and play with all the toys.  And your kid walks in and then hugs you.  Exactly.  And then you look like this.  Exactly.  It's terrible.  And they have a lady at my doctor's office that looks like, who was the female Shrek character?  No joke.  Really?  Horrible looking.  With like the little hair on her chin. 
[01:42:00]  She's got the whole deal going on.  I fucking hate that.  It's like, take that off.  Oh!  I know.  What are you doing?  I was on the treadmill the other day, and they had the doctors on, or Oz, one of those  doctor shows.  And a woman had one of those big bubble things on her chin, those big witch-like things.  And they're like, we're going to remove it.  I'm just jogging along.  I'm like, they're not going to show this, are they?  And they sit her down, and I'm like, oh no, they're going to show it.  And I figure they're going to laser it.  They took a knife.  And just sliced it off. 
[01:42:30]  And sliced it off.  Yep.  Just carved it off like a jackalice.  I guess a little bit, but they just sliced it right off.  I'm all about mole removal.  You don't need those wacky moles on your face anymore.  And it's not even that expensive.  It really isn't.  I have this tiny little red dot here, which I'm afraid would turn into it.  Should I get it removed now?  I got one.  It's a red axe.  It's a red...  Oh, an axe!  It's a red freckle.  Those are okay.  That's all right.  I don't think they get bigger.  No?  I have a TD skin tag.  I want to take it off my head right there.  Top left.  That's not...  I had an inner thigh skin tag.  You could do that yourself. 
[01:43:00]  I just took it off myself.  Yeah, you could do tags yourself.  That's easy.  No, I can't.  You want me to do it?  No.  Go ahead.  How would you do it?  You just pull it out a little bit.  Yeah.  And then just wear the razor.  No.  Clean razor.  We'll sterilize the razor before we do it.  Yeah.  Or if you're in a hotel in Seattle, you just take a pair of toenail clippers and get it that  way.  Who did that?  I did.  You're going to hurt.  It hurt.  It hurt more than I thought it was going to hurt because it's like this little white skin  tag.  You think, oh... 
[01:43:30]  You're one of those guys, huh?  My brother's one of those guys because he's in the restaurant industry and for many, many,  many years, no health insurance.  So he's done so much surgery.  Self-surgery.  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  I have to have him call up for the list of things he's done himself.  It's unbelievable.  And he seems pretty good at it because the scarring is not bad.  Well, you realize your body can kind of take a lot of stuff.  Right.  You know?  Let me see it.  Where is it?  Left side.  That's really close to the...  Jimmy, we could take care of that. 
[01:44:00]  Easy.  It's small.  We'd have to hold them down.  Yeah.  Hey, so the lady that does the shots in my kid's doctor's office looks like the female  Shrek, but I got a better match.  You know the lady that's gone viral on the internet lately singing like Sweet Home Alabama  and all that with the missing teeth and the really greasy hair and the...  Is she a good singer?  She's horrendous.  But every video she puts up, she gets like over a million views.  The internet loves this woman.  Really?  She's got big, fat, disgusting nothing.  That's really a good show business technique. 
[01:44:30]  If you look horrible and do anything...  I swear to you, the lady that gives shots to my little kid looks pretty...  Looks like it could be her sister.  Oh, your poor kid.  And she comes in and she doesn't give a fuck if the kids cry.  This is her job is to give shots to kids all day long.  Your poor kid.  Getting shots is bad enough and then you have this wildebeest coming into the room.  And for the people who think that I'm exaggerating, I'll take a picture of her next time.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, she looks like she could be related to this woman. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  If I saw that on the bus, I wouldn't run.  Yeah.  Then the kid got the shots in the arm for the first time and boy, that's a different experience  because he's no muscle.  He's...  A little over a year.  Oh, those are the worst.  And now...  Did you cry?  Uh, no.  Did you tear up?  But you're frightening it a little, aren't you?  I teared up like the first or second time ever.  The first time they get their shots is just brutal.  It kills you.  Really?  You cry when you said that?  Oh, it kills you.  I didn't cry. 
[01:45:30]  I'll be honest with you.  But you do kind of get a little...  You get a little...  A little misty.  Welled up.  Why?  Because you're taking your little baby and they're just...  Exactly.  You've been coddling them into this pure little thing and they're enjoying life and they're  just with you for the first six months and you go into this doctor and they take this  metal shot and just jab them and the kid, even though they're this little...  Stop breathing.  They stop breathing and look at you like...  What the fuck?  What did you do?  Why did you bring me here?  Oh, you feel like you betrayed them?  Yeah.  And then they start screaming.  You feel responsible.  There's a whole weird portrayal thing that happens and you can't explain to the kid yet 
[01:46:00]  that we need to do this to keep you kind of healthy and she looks like that woman on  top of it.  Oh, that's terrible.  Dad, why?  Why don't you explain?  Explain to the kid about disease and stuff like that and famine.  So do you hold the kid while they're doing it?  You'll get scurvy.  No, because you don't want a connection and then you're the, hey, look, I'll take care  of you again.  Yeah.  Is that why?  That beast will fucking give the shots and then hand over the kid to you.  But doesn't that give them the fear of the doctor?  And she doesn't even...  Yes.  She's not even phased this woman that does it in my place there. 
[01:46:30]  No, it's...  Not even phased.  It's their job.  They just...  The problem is the first time he was completely aware and really gave us the look like, dude,  what the fuck?  It's the worst.  And they scream and cry.  How many shots?  Last time it was three.  Yeah.  And there's no muscle in there, little arms yet.  No.  They're fat little thighs that Uncle Paul would love.  You could get a needle.  Like little turkey legs.  You could get a needle in there.  Easy.  Yeah.  But a bony little, like, it's not even developed shoulder yet. 
[01:47:00]  Well, that's what they get for being kids.  That's how you toughen them up.  Needles for babies.  Trees.  Then they put Band-Aids on them and they just bubble up.  They're too big and poor kids.  It's so old.  How old?  But they cry for, what, five minutes and then they're done?  It's even less than that.  Yeah, it's less.  It's less.  It's over.  And their little brains can't process it.  So by the time you're outside, they're like, oh, trees.  Right.  They don't even like it.  They're giggling again.  It still affects you and they're just fucking looking at trees outside.  Right. 
[01:47:30]  It means so much to you.  Right.  Because you can think.  Right.  They're like salamander brains.  Right.  Tom, I don't have kids.  If you said something once about your daughters and the way you look at life, you said like  everybody's a potential creep or something.  I thought it was hard to sell it one night.  Everybody's a potential fucking problem or threat in the street.  Maybe you weren't here because I've talked about it on the air too.  Like when I walked this, sorry Tom, but I'm in on this one with you.  No, go.  When I walk the streets now, I know who the creeps are. 
[01:48:00]  And I never knew before.  No, before it was just people.  It was just people.  But now you see how they look at your kid and it's not even you wonder.  You're like, that guy is absolutely a fucking creep.  You see like an old, skeevy dude just kind of walking and they like stop in their tracks  and watch your daughter like walk down the sidewalk.  Ew, really?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  In my case, it's a little boy, but yes.  Yes.  Do you stare at the guy like, what the fuck are you looking at?  There was one time where I had, I had a thing with a guy. 
[01:48:30]  What happened?  The guy was just really vibing me.  He was really creepy.  And the kids were little and I just caught his eye.  I caught his eye and he looked guilty.  He was like, he didn't realize an adult was looking at him.  And that really set me off.  And I was like, you have something?  You want something?  You looking for something?  You want to talk about it?  You want to?  And I just really got in his face and he just kind of, you know, skittered away and masturbated 
[01:49:00]  in the end of the aisle.  But really, I mean.  But if he wasn't doing anything wrong, he would go, why?  What are you talking about?  Like, he obviously was.  You completely, your instincts.  You do, yes.  Your instincts are completely true.  Yeah, your gut's usually right.  You're not looking for it.  You just see this creep and then you.  He was leering at the kids and he didn't know you were looking at him?  Yes.  It didn't mean that it had nothing to do with me being the father.  It was just, oh, a grown-up just, I got busted. 
[01:49:30]  It's like when you look at a girl's ass and you get busted.  It's the same thing.  Now, let me ask you, when you, how could, because I avoid contact with kids.  I don't want anything misinterpreted.  Yeah.  But like, you know, sometimes you talk to a kid or whatever for a second in the elevator  with the family there.  Yeah.  I guess you can feel the difference between.  You know.  You just know.  You know.  You really just know.  Your instinct.  And the kid knows.  Kicks in.  Right?  The kid knows a lot of times.  My kid, yeah, knows who the assholes are already.  Yeah.  And avoids them.  Yeah.  There might be an asshole or two in my own family that he doesn't really dig. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Already, I could tell his whole, like, personality completely changes around certain individuals.  Yeah.  And you, and I don't.  It's so weird what they pick up on.  When we were kids, it was like, you respect your elders.  Say hello to this person.  Give this person a kiss.  I just follow their lead.  If they're not cool with it, all right.  That's fine.  They know.  They don't want to say hello to this person for whatever reason.  Right.  That's all right.  You can act like an ass.  Yeah.  Papa nailed it, man.  And it's like, they get caught looking at your kid.  And you're like, what the fuck, dude? 
[01:50:30]  Although, kids sometimes will be weird, like, if somebody has coffee breath, they won't want  to say hi.  I know.  Or because somebody has, like, a mole.  Ah!  You're like, no, you don't understand.  That's not a reason to alienate them from your life.  Right.  Exactly.  They're ugly.  It's a right.  My kid made me brush my teeth better.  Yeah.  Because I remember an incident where, not with me, but my little niece, she was maybe two  at the time, and we're at a wedding, and we all stayed over in a hotel, and my dad is  hanging out with the grandchildren, having a moment, and in front of everybody during 
[01:51:00]  brunch, oh, my God, your breath stinks.  It's the worst.  And I never forgot that.  Was he embarrassed reading, Chad?  Oh, he was embarrassed.  My poor dad.  He saw it all.  He was mortified.  Terrible.  But at that moment, it hit my brain, like, when I have a kid, I'm going to start brushing  my teeth better.  Your breath stinks.  Because I wake up in the morning and brush my teeth as soon as I get up before coffee.  Normally, without kids, I would drink coffee, then eat, and then I brush my teeth. 
[01:51:30]  Now, I brush my teeth immediately, just so my kids don't think I'm scummy.  I got a niece that's a wise-ass, like myself, and she was two at the time, and was not just  your breath stinks.  Hey, everybody.  I forgot what she called them at the time.  Grandpa, whatever.  Grandpa's breath stinks.  My little one said to my wife just, like, a week ago that her breath smelled like rabbit  food.  She really did.  It smelled like rabbit food.  Oh, good morning. 
[01:52:00]  And it doesn't matter.  It's something, it feels just as bad if a peer said it.  Like, you're like, ugh.  It's more, it's human, it's almost like the fucking kid didn't obey the social conventions  that we all obey, and the social politeness.  Right.  Lie.  That's why kids are horrified.  Offer a mint.  When does that kick in, you think?  I don't know.  How old do your kids talk?  When they can talk.  Nine and six.  No, I mean, when does it kick in where they realize they can't just say, hey, grandpa's  breath stinks?  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, my daughter, my daughter, it's the older one who, when she was around six, she 
[01:52:30]  had a babysitter, and she thought she smelled like burritos.  Oh, God.  And she kept it quiet to herself.  Like, she had her for a long time, and we would come home, and did you like playing with  her?  Yeah, it was great.  We had a nice time.  And then she quietly one day just said, we were having a burrito, and she said it smelled  like the babysitter.  And I said, does she always smell like that?  Yeah, she always smells like burritos.  Burritos, and I realized, oh, so she's been living her life with this woman all the time 
[01:53:00]  thinking, wow, she sounds a lot like burritos, but didn't say anything.  You know what I mean?  It was like a very adult moment.  You have a funny joke in your act, actually, about mommy's breath smells like a taco or  something.  Yeah, mommy's breath smells like tacos.  And it's just, that's the type of thing a fucking kid says and doesn't understand the  humiliation.  Like, if it's just, I don't think, she's probably not embarrassed around just you and the kids.  Who cares?  It's you guys.  But it's only if other people, like if a girl I was dating for six months or less told 
[01:53:30]  my breath stunk, I'd be like, oh.  Right.  But like, when I grew up in two years, if her breath didn't smell good, I'd be like, ugh,  the fuck?  Right.  But I didn't care, because I already drank her piss.  It didn't matter.  It's like, believe me, what you know about me, there's nothing I'm going to say to embarrass  you.  Right.  Unbelievable.  When someone says you have bad breath, you, when you're ever around that person, you're  conscious of it.  Right?  I was on the road once with Mitch Fatale, and we were in like Wisconsin, like doing all  these gigs together.  And he was like, oh, your breath. 
[01:54:00]  We're in this little car.  He was like, your breath is terrible.  And still to this day, when I see him, I get like, I stand back a little bit.  Wait, he told you in front of the lady or no?  No, no, no.  We were alone.  But it was still so like, he was so horrified.  Voss told me one time, this is why you have to hate Rich Voss.  I remember I'd smoked or whatever, and I was chewing some piece of gum.  And we were in front, me and Voss were doing a scene in this acting class.  Oh, my God.  It was this woman.  We used to take acting with this woman, Maggie, on Fifth Avenue.  She had this acting thing. 
[01:54:30]  I saw her recently, actually.  I did a one-scene shoot for Louie, and she was there doing something.  So I just bring back this memory.  And Voss and I were doing a scene.  I kind of thought she was hot, and I wanted to fuck her.  So we're doing this read, and Voss just goes, your breath fucking stinks.  In the middle of the scene?  Right with me, her, and him.  I was like, oh, you fucking horrible cunt.  I didn't care if he thought it.  Right.  Because you just told me about the chick being there.  But he's so dumb.  He's like, oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[01:55:00]  He's as dumb as they come.  Yeah, he's pretty stupid.  I love the idea of you guys doing a scene together.  It wasn't good.  Would you rehearse alone before you got to glass?  I don't remember if we knew what it was.  Maybe he was just talking about both of our acting, which would have been very accurate.  Our acting stinks.  I used to have a food pocket, but I'm good now.  You used to what?  I had a food pocket.  What's a food pocket?  Well, it might make your mouth seem like it's rotting.  What?  You don't have food pockets?  You're lucky.  What do you mean a food pocket? 
[01:55:30]  I've never heard of this.  Oh, it's in the fucking...  Where food gets caught at the bottom of your...  In between your teeth.  You can't really get in there.  Oh, really?  So it just keeps packing down.  Oh.  Well, do you fucking floss?  Look, man, I took care of the problem.  Do you floss, though?  I don't have a food pocket anymore.  Did you floss?  Yeah, but you can't really get in there properly and all that.  Wouldn't you...  All that shit.  I would poke sideways to try to get shit out of there.  Is that the technical term?  Food pocket?  Yeah.  Really? 
[01:56:00]  And it used to get really bad after seafood.  Two days after seafood.  A piece of snapper in it?  Something.  Like a fucking shrimp or a clam or whatever.  I got something years ago.  And I didn't realize, because I always took care of my teeth, but I'm like,  What the fuck, man?  My mouth smells like garbage.  You know it's really bad when you can smell it.  And I'd be embarrassed for myself.  I'd get frustrated.  I'd floss.  I'd do everything.  You'd do the pelican check. 
[01:56:30]  Put your fucking lower mouth out.  Under your nose.  Yeah.  I would get every apparatus.  Like, I would drink coffee and smell my own breath on the coffee.  All that shit.  Oh, it's brutal.  I got a dry socket, which gave me something like many, many years ago.  It's like when I had one of my wisdom teeth pulled.  And then, because I smoked back then, and the blood clot pulled so it didn't clot.  And it's very agonizing.  It's like a nail being stabbed on the bone.  Oh, my God.  A dry socket, if anyone's ever had one in your mouth, is agonizing. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  It's when your mouth does not heal, and then a pocket forms, and food collects.  And I had that years ago.  They have to pack it with a special mouth paste.  They clean it out.  And when they clean it, it's agony.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it fucking hurts, brother.  Well, my dentist just closed the gap between the two teeth, so the food can't be packing down anymore.  So I'm good now.  No food pocket.  Did you ever know anybody, though, who had, and I guess we all have, chronically awful breath? 
[01:57:30]  Yes.  I didn't want to do that, Sam.  Sam is pointing.  I was trying to be a good guy.  We might have had somebody on staff.  Oh, really?  I wasn't even, but it's not anymore, though, right?  No, it's in the past, because I don't know.  He fixed it?  I think he's fixed it.  I don't feel like mentioning his name today.  What, Sam?  It's a lot of gum involved.  Like, he chews gum constantly.  All right, whatever it takes.  That's good.  But it comes from the stomach, a lot of it.  You've got to take care of that stomach.  What do you think is the worst dental surgery?  Oh.  I mean, you can talk.  One that is required because a fist is cramping in teeth. 
[01:58:00]  You can talk root canals and all that.  I'm talking basic shit that a lot of people have had done.  Root canals are pretty rough.  There was a guy that I worked with, I don't want to mention his name, in radio.  He had to have his gums cleaned out.  Have you heard of what they do?  Yeah.  No.  You have heard of it, right?  I have, yes.  They take a scalpel, I guess, and they cut your gum down in the front.  Then they cut it in the back here.  And they actually now flip down the gum to clean out all the shit. 
[01:58:30]  And you can't take anesthesia?  I'm just going to make that up.  Why?  Why would you do that?  They do it in four increments.  Why?  Because it's so bad and dirty down there that it's now fucking up your teeth.  You're going to lose all your teeth if they don't do this.  I don't know.  Because the gums can get awful if you don't take care of them.  It gets way down below where just normal cleanings at the dentist doesn't take care of the problem anymore.  So they actually cut your gum and fold it down so they can get underneath. 
[01:59:00]  Are we looking at the voice?  Yeah.  Oh, horse teeth.  Wait, what is this surgery?  This is when he had to have his fake teeth taken off.  He only has 15,000 views for this video?  That's lost.  Do you know how many dumb things have come out of that hole?  Lost his mouth.  We're looking at his huge wormhole.  Yeah, it really is awful.  What is that?  Novocaine.  It's a Novocaine?  They're checking his tattoo before he runs the Derby. 
[01:59:30]  That is a terrible mouth.  All surrounded by that pubic hair.  What we're going to do next is we're going to remove the bridge.  We're going to remove the bridge.  Remove the bridge.  I can't.  Yeah.  They're removing his teeth.  I don't know how guys do this for a living.  Oh, it's terrible.  Especially in the mouth.  The smell.  The smell.  Oh, my God.  They're trying to yank out his...  I can't.  I can't.  Jimmy's staying in there.  I'm out.  Jimmy's not even wincing.  Jimmy walks out of teeth.  Look, he's not even in a paint hole.  Oh, he's got no teeth.  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  It's a little teeth post.  Oh, that's terrible.  He's a hobo.  Yeah.  He looks like a hobo.  Sam, you can't watch?  Fucking watch it.  Man up.  Get out of here.  That's terrible.  Turn it away.  I got to go for a cleaning soon.  Just a routine cleaning.  What are they doing?  Just cleaning out his shit?  Yeah.  They had to rebuild like pegs in his mouth to hold his new bridge.  Wow.  This is a horrible...  That is a...  See?  Oh, look at this part.  That's not a big deal.  Oh, those little nubs.  He's got little brown nubs. 
[02:00:30]  This is real teeth.  That is a fucking...  That seems to look like cigarette butts.  They do.  They look like tiny cigarette butts in his mouth.  And there's only four of them.  How do you do that?  Do you see that the gums folded back?  Look at the gums folded back.  Wait, they did fold the gums back?  That's what I was talking about.  Can you imagine if he was...  Is he awake for that?  Yeah, but he's...  This is hurting me.  Now, how painful is this after the fact?  Because I'm miserable after stupid cleaning.  You have to take...  Yeah.  Like, Ronnie B probably wouldn't take medication.  I would have to.  I take, like, Vicodin or whatever.  When it comes to, like, agonizing pain.  Yes, I do, too.  I have a cousin that takes no Novocaine. 
[02:01:00]  He just sits...  A root canal.  I swear to God.  He's a root canal.  He just grips the side of the chair and takes it.  Is that because he enjoys the pain aspect of the whole thing?  Yeah, I think he's a real big guy, and he just likes...  He's got to be one of those guys.  Yeah.  But wait, he has a root canal with no anesthesia?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  I swear to God.  Dude, I've had Novocaine for cleanings.  Oh, my God.  Oh, all the time.  I have had it for cleanings.  Yeah, me too.  He would get it for this, though.  There's no way you could take that without a fucking...  You could not...  Look at him.  They're just yanking at shit. 
[02:01:30]  They're digging into his gums.  How does he fucking do root canal with no Novocaine?  No.  That bothers me.  He literally just...  He's like 6'5".  He's just like this animal.  He just gripped the side of the chair.  Just rips the chair apart.  Go ahead.  He's like, Tom, it only hurts for a little bit.  It only hurts when they do the thing.  Then it's not so bad.  That white pain where your eyes just go white?  That's for us.  Just imagine that over and over again.  Why does he do that?  He just doesn't think he needs painkillers.  He can manage his own pain with his head. 
[02:02:00]  There are people that do that.  And I know Tom is telling the truth.  I don't comprehend the...  Like, I see if you're a Marine and you're with other Marines, you're getting a tattoo.  But when you're in a dentist chair, why wouldn't you?  I can't think of any good reason to not get noticed.  I know.  Maybe he hates needles that much.  Oh, no, he couldn't.  He hates...  No, I was going to say he hates drugs, but he doesn't.  Hey, Fat Matt from Sparta.  Is that in New Jersey?  Yes, it is.  Okay.  Going back to the kid thing, I don't want to lose this line because it's pretty good.  The other day, this guy was getting in the shower and his son was in the bathroom and said, 
[02:02:30]  Ew, your penis smells like watermelon.  Why is he smelling his penis?  Exactly.  That's why I'm reading this.  There's a lot going on here.  Why does your penis smell like watermelon?  Why is your kid pointing it out?  Oh, that's terrible.  There's a couple things going on.  You better explain, Fat Matt.  Yeah.  Fat Matt's got to take his own shower.  You've got some explaining to do.  It's terrible.  When I was in high school, we had a guy...  Oh, look.  Now he's removing nubs.  Ah, I can't. 
[02:03:00]  That's how that looks going in.  No noise.  Take the noise off.  It's a freeze-dried bone allograft, which basically means it's cadaver bone.  Cadaver bone?  He's putting dead people's bones in his mouth.  No, no.  That was a brain replacement.  His boss is dumb.  Like Frankenstein.  Would you take cadaver bones?  No.  If I needed to, sure.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, sure.  Put cadaver bones in your body?  If that was the option.  If I would use that or I'd never eat fucking chew gum again.  Yeah.  I've got a cadaver bone in my face. 
[02:03:30]  No way, man.  What the fuck do I care?  Oh, it's so creepy.  Dad, I'm busy.  No way.  Great, baby.  Quick, cadaver bones.  That shit's got to come out at night or something.  No, exactly.  I think your dreams get different or something.  You want fucking dentures, Brett?  Yeah, your dreams get weird.  I'm telling you.  You start dreaming about that guy's evil past.  Or something with him now is in your dreams.  You've got to get, there's got to be some synthetic thing that can replace cadaver bones.  I'll tell you one thing.  With stem cells and stuff.  Come on, Sam.  Look at it.  Why, Sam?  Why?  With stem cells, they'll be growing your own stuff, though. 
[02:04:00]  Like in time, they'll be fucking growing your own stuff.  I think stem cells take care of all this shit.  You'll have just a whole bunch of spare parts in the basement.  Whatever you need, that probably ought to make.  I mean, or most of what you need.  Unless you're blown up in a fucking explosion.  Right.  Yeah.  And you can't make all the pieces.  Oh, perio charting.  Yeah.  What's that?  Perio charting is painful.  The dentist takes a tapered needle-like gauze and sticks it between the gums and teeth  to measure the space for gum disease. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, you get this every once in a while.  And this guy, Brian, from Illinois, he goes, I've sat through four hours of tattooing that  was less painful.  Wow.  Perio charting?  They got me first, right?  Because that's that white fucking pain.  You feel it when they hit a nerve.  God.  But it makes you appreciate the marathon man more when you see it.  Yeah.  When he digs in, when he drills into a sick tooth, and then he goes, and that was a  sick tooth.  That nerve is dying.  Yeah.  And then he gets to a healthy tooth.  White pain's a good description.  White pain.  Yeah.  Everything just goes white for a split second. 
[02:05:00]  It's an indescribable agony.  My mother had a lot of, because she had too many teeth for her little mouth, which, you  know, sorry, Dad, that you had to live like that.  But she had a lot of gum surgery, and she was always in fucking agony.  Oh, that's terrible.  I had one time, because they were a client, I swear, and maybe I was a little vain as  well.  Sure.  I'll throw it on the table.  I got my teeth whitened.  Sure.  They don't tell you that there's little pores in your teeth, and when they put the 
[02:05:30]  chemicals in, you feel white pain for about three or four straight days.  All of a sudden, you'll just be sitting here talking, and your whole body will cringe.  It's a ping.  You felt this, too?  I want to get it done again.  Fuck.  I'll never do it again.  I'd rather have yellow teeth.  Yeah.  It was horrendous.  The legs are whitening, I think, right?  Well, it's the chemicals they put in to whiten your teeth, and it's still on your teeth  and go into the pores out of nowhere.  For three or four days, you'll feel this white pain.  But you look good.  It's not one tooth.  It just goes like, you know. 
[02:06:00]  No, I added it all over my mouth.  It's just a ping.  Ow.  Gone.  But it's a slight.  It's a quick second.  It was worth it, though.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about?  I certainly do.  You don't want yellow teeth.  I thought of that.  But you can do other things to get white teeth.  Like what?  The crest strips are too white.  No, get those molds, and then you squirt the stuff in, and you sleep with it.  Who the fuck?  I can't.  I would fucking suffocate like that.  Who can sleep with a fucking mold in their mouth?  I can't even sleep if my pillow's not just right.  How am I supposed to sleep with a shit in my mouth? 
[02:06:30]  You can sleep like that?  I have, yeah.  With them?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck that, dude.  See, your mouth has to be closed?  They're not big.  They're like really tight to your teeth.  It doesn't feel like much of a thing.  Can you open your mouth or no?  Yeah, yeah.  You just do the top one night and the bottom the next night.  How long do you do it for?  Like two or three times each night?  Yeah.  Why don't they stop?  Why don't you just go for a couple of hours, you put your iPod on, give a few days of agonizing  fucking nail on the gums agony, and then you just smile on the camera.  What's happening?  I didn't know you could do that.  You ever see, I think it was on Showtime or HBO, a show called The Dentist with Corman, 
[02:07:00]  who's the guy from LA Law?  Corman Burns?  Don't know.  Harvey Corman?  What?  Burnson, I think.  Burnson?  Yeah.  It was a twisted fucking show.  Oh, yeah.  He was a sadistic dentist and got his revenge on people by just strapping them to his dentist  chair and doing all this horrific stuff.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That's a fun time.  Let's watch that show for an hour.  When I was in high school, we had a guy called The Trip Master, and he was a really old dude,  and he loved gas, and he would give you gas for everything, and he told us that he even 
[02:07:30]  took gas once in a while just because he liked it so much, and he talked really like this.  He'd be like, yeah, so I just sit down, and we're going to have a little cleaning day.  You'd like the gas, right?  And I'd be like, yes, Trip Master, I would like the gas.  You know why he was touching penises?  Yeah, I'm sure he was.  He had to be touching something.  I'd let The Trip Master jerk me off.  I would, too.  If I was all fucking zoned out and zooted, as they say in the hood. 
[02:08:00]  There was one time when I was flying on it and came out kind of aggressively, and I thought  it was just me freaking out from the drugs, but maybe something was happening.  Yeah, maybe it was like you were in a coma, and you could feel it, but you couldn't stop it.  Yeah.  Like succinylcholine.  I saw The Trip Master's head going up and down.  Yeah.  You had a little jizz on The Trip Master's tie.  The Trip Master really enjoyed his job.  He fucking rules.  He had really thick glasses. 
[02:08:30]  I think a bunch of women left with their bras not quite right.  It's true.  I never thought of that.  Like a girl going in there would be a horrible idea.  Why don't you just lay back, and we're going to get the gas for this checkup.  Let's be honest with each other, though.  If you were a dentist, wouldn't you do the exact same thing if you had that much control?  To yourself with the gas or to the girls with the gas?  The girls with the nice bosoms.  Of course I would.  I'm a comic, and I try to do it.  I was a dentist?  Yes.  I like the story you were telling earlier, how the guy just was the EMT guy. 
[02:09:00]  He just put his hand on the girl's breast.  It's such a bonehead, non-sexual, just like seeing breast touching breast.  You know what I mean?  You can't get away with it.  It's not even like a sexual breast.  You would have to hire a dental assistant that knew how to keep her mouth shut.  Yeah.  Because that's where it would all go wrong if you hired the wrong dental assistant.  She has to be in on it.  You would make her go get tools and coffee, you know, so the gas master could operate. 
[02:09:30]  I'm going to be turning the gas on now.  Or the trip master, was it?  The trip master.  Why don't you take a walk to Starbucks?  I'm going to be turning on the gas.  What a great name.  And she knew what was going on, but she would just have to deal with it.  Yeah.  You'd have to pay her a lot, I guess.  Or she'd have to be into it.  Or into it, too.  Yeah.  By the way, I don't forget to plug Tom's The Marriage Ref for the new season.  Is it season two or three?  Three.  Season two.  Season two.  Starts on Sunday.  It starts on Sunday night.  It's NBC.  NBC.  What times?  10 o'clock.  Oh, 10 o'clock. 
[02:10:00]  It's a great time.  Every Sunday this summer.  Oh, Tom will be on Leno this Friday.  All right, cool.  Good for you, Tom.  Who are you on with?  Owen Wilson.  That's cool.  Yeah, isn't that cool?  I'd like to meet him.  I was supposed to be on this week, but I got switched to July.  July?  What happened?  What happened?  No, I was going to cover this Invention, Inventors Convention.  Oh, you did that last year.  It was good.  But that's why Jack Cohen goes, oh, let's do something different this year.  So they sent me to the ESPYs.  Oh, that's good.  I've never done the ESPYs.  But you should have went back to the...  No, they just like the...  I mean, I understood why. 
[02:10:30]  But you did a great job with that.  It'd be fun to see what you do this year.  They just want it to probably be a different theme or a different, you know...  They don't want it to...  It's almost like I think I'm on a good roll and they don't want to fuck with it.  So I'm like, whatever they want to do, I'm fine with.  Yeah, ESPYs will be great.  That'll be...  Yeah, but I don't...  See some good guys.  I hope so.  I know that I'm going to be out of my mind trying to get photos.  I know.  You're not going to believe me.  They should not send me that.  That's why I was saying it was going to be good for you to give pictures.  We have a great question coming in.  We really do.  What's your name, sir?  Marcos from Yonkers. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Marcos.  He's a regular.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on?  I wanted to ask you guys, because we were talking about bad breath earlier.  Which one do you think is the worst to kiss someone?  Bad morning breath or someone that smokes cigarettes and you do not smoke cigarettes?  I hated kissing girls with cigarette breath.  Yeah.  I hated that.  I have to agree.  Always fucking hated that.  Morning breath is worse, though.  Morning breath, if you like the person, is no big deal.  Fuck that.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:11:30]  Man, I don't fuck in the morning.  I don't like morning sex.  I hate it.  But morning sex is good because of the morning breath, because you don't have to kiss.  That is true.  You can't avoid all intimacy.  But do you face away?  I don't know.  If you face the person, fuck that.  I don't feel sexy in the morning.  I have to shit my fucking...  Am I tired?  So someone with cigarette breath is better?  I don't like cigarette breath either.  I'm a morning cigarette breath.  Oh, that's rough.  That's got to be really rough.  There's a weird cigarette breath, a dry cigarette breath that's horrendous. 
[02:12:00]  But I would say morning breath is the worst.  Well, because cigarette breath brings on some bad breath, too, because you're drying out  your mouth, which makes things do whatever they fucking do when your mouth is dry.  But I think morning breath is worse.  And the cigarette breath, you kind of relate to the cigarette.  Like, the morning breath, you relate to the person.  Yeah, it's their body stinking.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  It's them.  They're to blame.  They are.  Not the cigarettes.  Their body is betraying both of you.  Not the cigarette stubs in boss's mouth.  If you really like the person, a little stink doesn't bother me at all. 
[02:12:30]  Dude, I would fucking...  If I'm dating a girl and I like her, I tell her, don't wear deodorant.  Yeah.  I want you to stink.  Like, I'll fucking literally, you know, don't shower today.  And then come over and just put your asshole on my face.  Seriously.  But morning breath, be honest.  That's, yeah, but morning breath.  I don't say I'm that without inconsistencies.  I like the stink of a body if I'm attracted to a girl a lot.  Yeah, I get that.  I don't want her feet to smell.  Yeah, it's animalistic.  It's fucking great, man.  Yeah, it's human. 
[02:13:00]  But the mouth has to be clean.  All right.  I hate the mouth not being clean.  Minty breath, stinky butt.  All right, Marcos, you good?  Everything else good with you?  Yeah, everything's good.  I was going to say, I just thought of an even worse one.  What about coffee cigarette breath?  That's bad, dude, but I'll tell you one thing.  I kind of enjoy that.  Some people have a weird, horrible smell to their mouth all the time, like a sickly sweet  smell, which could be a rotted tooth. 
[02:13:30]  Like milky.  Yeah, a dry, or that pitted pocket.  Nah, but it comes from the stomach.  It's like a smell of a kernel of pill.  A bile and a sweet, a sweet corn smell.  Wrapped in ham.  You know what that is?  It's acid reflux that makes it all the way up to the back of your mouth.  You know what?  You might be right.  I'm telling you right now.  Those people, and it's like a four-foot radius, that breath.  You can smell it from far away.  It's bad.  Scott in Alabama has a good one.  Story about people taking nothing for oral surgery. 
[02:14:00]  Scott, you're a dentist?  No, no, no.  My dad is an old school army guy, and for some reason, he is just scared to death of needles.  And he has had to have major oral surgery later in his life.  And they had to sign, the dentist that he goes to had to make a special waiver, because  he won't even let them inject Novocaine into his gums when he has to have them do stuff. 
[02:14:30]  Local anesthesia swab only.  Wow.  Never a needle, never gas.  That's tough.  Why?  That's just crazy.  How about he gets over the fear of needles first?  I mean, no one likes a needle.  Well, who likes a needle?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't, but look the other ways.  They always have Oprah on.  See who Oprah's talking to.  Those swabs help.  They warm me up for the needle.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I'll kick the needle every fucking time instead of having that white fucking...  Yeah.  It's so much better than the pain of that nerve. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God.  It just rockets right through your brain.  That, to me, is an agonizing, the raw fucking pain of a nerve being...  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  Hey, I agree with you guys, but I have seen them literally go into convulsions when they've  had to do just simple things like take blood.  Well, that's...  See, that all goes back to being a baby and, I mean, when you're, like, literally a baby  and that horrible experience of going to the doctor.  It's weird that we don't know how to negate that pain in our minds and go, look, it's temporary. 
[02:15:30]  It taps into some fucking weird childhood shit where you're in a cold metal thing or whatever  and these horrible monsters are sticking pointy things in you.  Yeah.  I agree completely because when he was a kid, he had to have a lot of surgeries and almost  died, so that's probably what he did.  What was wrong with him?  He had some kind of a weird intestinal problem and they basically had to cut him open and  rearrange his intestines when he was little. 
[02:16:00]  Wow, that sucks.  It's terrible.  All right, Scott.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mike.  How about...  Is it your birthday?  Yes.  I didn't know that, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  39 years young.  Oh, you look great, Jim.  You look just great.  Frank in Indiana.  Frank.  Oh, Frank looks better. 
[02:16:30]  Can we break before our guest?  Where is he?  I don't know if he's here yet.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  We're going to try to break before the guest.  You want to take a quick break?  I have to leave at 9.  You do?  What?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah.  I got to go just...  I know.  It's lame.  You're missing a good one.  I know.  But I...  Where you got to go next?  I got to go promote the marriage riff.  That's what you're doing now.  I know.  You have more radio on this platform promotion to go promote somewhere else.  I got to go do like a tour.  A tour?  A tour?  Yeah.  No, not here.  Oh, no.  Okay.  I just got to do it. 
[02:17:00]  Terrestrial tour around the country.  He's a shady cat.  No, I feel bad saying I will have to go do other things because you know I only want  to do this.  Oh, so you got to like sit in a room?  I got to sit in a room and...  Talk to one station at a time?  Yeah, like 20 stations and answer the same question.  We got to do that one time.  It's grueling.  And tomorrow I got to do it on TV.  You ever do that when you sit there and you do TV station after TV station?  No, Tom.  We've actually never done that.  Oh, for sure.  Why don't you rub that in?  Why don't you rub that in, Tom? 
[02:17:30]  It's awful.  We're thoroughly acknowledged in the TV world.  Don't you know that?  It's an awful thing.  Who's on the first episode?  Your video stuff is awesome, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  That thing you did on Sunday at the park was great.  You like that one?  Really good.  Yeah.  What do you do?  What I kept thinking is, how is he editing the...  Do you do it by yourself?  You edit it all together?  Yeah, I do everything by myself.  He kept coming back to the violins and stuff?  Yeah, I just use iMovie.  It's good.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  You get Final Cut done a lot.  Yeah, I got to get a better editing program.  Final Cut Pro, dude, is a great program.  Is it easy to use? 
[02:18:00]  In one afternoon, I just saw a lot of weird shit, and I didn't even know what I was going  to do with it.  And then I started kind of like fingering it out in my head and put it together as one  video.  I love that guy.  The floppy balls guy?  Yeah, that guy was awesome.  Thank you.  Man, Tom, thank you.  Actually, that means a lot to me.  It's really good.  I'm not joking.  I'm serious.  It's really, really good.  And I love this.  When you get closer in on this guy to see his face, you're like, because in the beginning,  you're like, he's not weird on the piano guy.  And then you're like, oh, yeah, he's out of his mind.  Well, it's weird because there's a piano in the middle of Central Park that some black  guy's playing.  Like, how does he get the piano there? 
[02:18:30]  I know.  Like, you can't just haul that around.  Why is there a piano in the middle of Central Park?  What do you call the white guy who bounces up and down?  Floppy balls.  He's great.  And then you got a little orchestra doing Bittersweet Symphony.  Yeah, they were good.  And then you got roller skaters.  I didn't know what to do.  And I figured, all right, I'll just try to make something out of this.  This lady bugged me.  But the piano guy, because people are asking, was playing to the bongo players.  I didn't make that up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, this was really good.  And then you got some.  I want to see more.  Some guy breakdancing as they're doing Bittersweet Symphony. 
[02:19:00]  You see him breakdancing in the background?  No.  Back to floppy balls.  Floppy balls is the best.  Go to my YouTube channel.  This spin of floppy balls was amazing.  You figure a guy like that, an old guy like that's going to fall over.  And then an amazing skateboarding trick.  And then back to the Bittersweet Symphony.  It's a good editing job.  Thanks, man.  Tom, seriously, thanks.  I appreciate that.  Go to my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, if you want to check it out.  It's called Let Your Freak Flag Fly.  I named it because a lot of freaks.  Yeah, it's really good.  And I did one yesterday. 
[02:19:30]  You want to see the one yesterday?  Yeah.  No.  Michael is here.  We don't need to need the break.  You want to just keep talking?  Let him just come up.  Yeah, that's fine.  Okay.  I just want to show you what this guy looked like.  It's from yesterday there, Sam.  Yeah, this.  This is yesterday?  It's either Robin Williams in drag or Fezzy in drag with a parrot on his head.  That's amazing.  He's got a 12-foot-long beard.  He's got birds on him.  And he's wearing a pink dress. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, a pink dress.  And he's taking money from me because I'm like, look, I need better video.  He doesn't like Robin.  That's funny.  Wow.  Looks like Robin Williams in drag or something.  A lot.  That's amazing.  With the line green Fisher King.  Yeah.  Fuck, that'll get me hits on this video.  I'm going to say it's Robin Williams in drag.  You should.  Why not?  I'm going to say I think this is Robin Williams in drag.  Wow.  I tweeted that video last night.  Go to my Twitter.  That is really good.  Tom Papa on Twitter.  Tom's a good one to follow.  Yeah, Tom Papa on Twitter.  You're a little edgy, Tom.  I like that.  Yeah?  Thank you.  I think of you sometimes as just a marriage ref guy. 
[02:20:30]  But Tom Papa's got a little edge to him.  Yeah.  Which is refreshing.  I like being on the tweet tweets.  Frank, really fast because we've got to move on to Michael Potts.  All right, Tom.  Get the fuck out of there.  Listen.  Hey.  Hey, I'm going to digress back to the bad breath.  Here's one for you.  It's impossible to avoid this one.  You're a dentist.  My dentist has ass breath.  Seriously?  Ass breath?  You know how to ride over the top of you?  Yeah.  How do you get out of that?  Know what that's about?  The guy fucking hates being a dentist. 
[02:21:00]  He's going to make everyone suffer.  Fucking horrible.  Well, no.  They usually wear masks now.  But that's like doctors, too.  Doctors will tell you.  Like, this Dr. Steve that we love, he eats like shit, but he'll tell you that you should  be doing all this stuff properly.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you tell a guy?  Like, dude, do you practice what you preach?  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  They don't care.  Dentists don't, and most doctors don't.  Most doctors are the most unhealthiest people walking this planet.  It's true.  Out of shape, smoking.  Right.  You should really cut back on bacon. 
[02:21:30]  Do you want to take a single?  Can I have to piss?  All right.  Can you take a single real quick?  Thank you for watching The Marriage Ref, fellas.  Yes, good luck, Tom.  This Sunday, 10 p.m. on NBC.  You guys are the best.  And Tom, I want to say, I'm digging you on our show, man.  I love being on your show.  I like what you bring to the show, so come back and see us.  I will.  I'll be back in a couple weeks.  Like Jimmy said, Marriage Ref this Sunday and Tom Papa on Twitter.  And we'll be right back with Michael Potts from Book of Mormon and The Wire.  Awesome.  What character in The Wire so people know?  Brother Muzone.  Nice.  We're talking to him next.  Good.  Stay there. 
[02:22:00]  Walk the straight and narrow track.  What is he not doing?  Eric.  Yeah.  Why would you bring us back?  You said one break.  Nobody told me anything different.  I was just walking in.  I didn't even get to sit down.  Why would you bring us back if no one's even in the studio?  And now you're playing The Wire theme and the guy's not even here, by the way.  Did you see The Wire guy anywhere close to the studio?  No.  I was told he was here.  Are we back home?  Yeah, but we got live reads and stuff. 
[02:22:30]  What happened to the live read?  Can we do another break?  Yeah, we could do one here.  I'll switch the beds.  Hang on.  Are we on the air right now?  Let me do the live read.  We're on the air.  Let's just do the live read.  How many live reads do I got left?  This is the last one.  Oh, this is the last one?  I mistook Roland's email.  That's my fault because he said downstairs meeting the publicist's way.  Now he's here, though.  Oh, Michael's here.  So it almost worked, E-Rock.  I'm going to walk him in.  Can I please get Michael Potts' seat?  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  Will you accept my apology? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, that's fine.  I can't do it now because now the guy's walking in.  Oh, he's here, here.  Yeah, he's right here.  This is him right here.  E-Rock is as dumb as they come.  Michael Potts, it's a pleasure, sir.  Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure.  How are you, buddy?  Good, good.  How are you?  Pleasure.  Me and Jimmy went and saw Book of Mormon, okay?  Cool.  And we absolutely loved it, so don't even be confused.  We loved it like everyone is loving it.  Right.  And I'm sitting there, and I think Jimmy was doing the same thing.  We're thinking to ourselves, how do we know this guy?  And it's really bothering us.  And then we discussed it on the air, and someone goes, he was in The Wire, which is pretty much 
[02:23:30]  our favorite show.  Oh, wow.  That's good to hear.  It's still good to hear.  And it's because you didn't have the glasses on.  Right.  And you weren't shooting anybody at close range.  Right.  In Book of Mormon, it was the name that got me.  Like, I looked in the playbill, and I said, Michael Potts, I know that name.  See, I didn't...  It drove me crazy, and then finally...  That's pretty cool.  I've been, you know, most of my career has been sort of face-familiar name obscure, so  it's not surprising that you recognize the name. 
[02:24:00]  Well, you played it...  It's odd that you played such a...  Brother Mazon.  Brother Mazon, yes.  From The Wire.  And we're like, and then it finally hit us, and we're...  Whatever, but...  One thing I would like to ask you about that, because we're obsessed with The Wire.  Obsessed.  We've had a lot of the guys on...  Oh, by the way, you're not going to be talking about the Book of Mormon here.  Yes.  It's excellent.  He has an amazingly good voice.  Blah, blah, Book of Mormon, blah, blah, blah.  Wire.  Let's go.  The Wire.  It's all about The Wire.  The Mormon...  Book of Mormon is just a musical version of The Wire. 
[02:24:30]  Don't tell Trey and Matt to bother you that.  You really are tremendous in that, which shows you what a varied performer.  But Brother Mazon, how much of that character did they tell you, look, this is the way we  would like it, or how much of that did you say, this is what I want to make this guy?  I'd say it's about, I guess, 40 and 60.  About 40 percent, they have...  All they do, they send you sides.  And then in the sides is little stage directions about, you know, Brother Mazon, you know, barely glances at, or he speaks very, very specifically, very clearly. 
[02:25:00]  And then you go from there.  So they pretty much let me do him the way I saw him as I read him.  I thought you were one of the most, it was one of the most interesting characters on the show.  I kind of wish that they had had him on more, or had you on more, because it's not at all like anybody else on the show.  Well, you see, that's, and see, that's the reason I'm glad they didn't, because I know a lot of people would have thought, you know, 
[02:25:30]  the character sort of jumped the shark, because he was so different from everyone else in the show.  And he's something totally, totally new and out of left field.  And, I mean, honestly, when I first did it, I never thought anybody would pay any attention to it,  that the character was all that interesting in turn, because they had so many other people,  and just the regulars, and their storylines.  So I never thought Brother Mazon would make much of a splash, so I'm surprised by it.  Oh my God, you stood out.  I think one of the best scenes in the entire series was, I think, in the end of season two, 
[02:26:00]  when Michael K. Williams, when Omar, shoots you in the stomach.  That dialogue between you guys is so amazing.  I know, I didn't find that out until the day of the shoot.  That you were getting shot?  Originally, the script they had sent, I was just going to get sort of hit in the shoulder.  And then I walked in and read the script for the day, and it said, shot in the gut.  And I went up to one of the producers, and I said, oh, come on, guys, I'm done already? 
[02:26:30]  You're killing me now?  And they were like, no, no, no, no, no.  We need to have a reason for you to be gone for a little bit and come back.  Because as they had written him, honestly, in the beginning, he was only supposed to be in one scene,  one episode, period.  And I guess they dug what I was doing a little bit, and so they decided to write more for him.  So they needed a reason for him to have to come back the following scene.  I've heard it's very emotional when they kill off a character, too.  The whole cast gets really bummed out. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  And The Wire, you know, you lost a lot of guys, obviously.  Right.  But when it was your turn, you know, to go, you know, around the set, there was a lot of emotions going on.  Oh, yeah.  It was a big deal.  I mean, the shooting of Stringer Bell, that day was really, really tense.  There was something in the script I don't think Idris was really, really happy about.  He was not happy about the way he was going to go out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There was something that Omar was supposed to do to him that Idris was not pleased with. 
[02:27:30]  And it was really, really tense on the script for a little bit.  No, he didn't do it.  They took it out.  They took out.  Was he supposed to piss on him?  Pretty much, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's so that I could get.  Yeah.  Wow.  Why wasn't he, that to me, because Omar hated him for having Brandon killed.  Which is what he blamed you for.  Right.  And we're talking like he's the real guy.  Like he's the character.  But did he just not want to get shot, or did he just not want him to do that?  Oh, no.  He was cool with getting shot.  And, of course, he was sad about not being on the show anymore. 
[02:28:00]  But he knew he had had that run, and that was the right way for the character.  He just didn't want to be pissed on.  He didn't think that that would be cool.  Wow.  That was the way for Stringer Bell to go out.  He didn't want the character to be.  It's weird how certain things, I guess, actors feel like the character will be tainted.  Right.  But I don't think that would have hurt the character at all.  I think that just would have been a further, kind of more of a victory for Omar, for avenging 
[02:28:30]  this guy being murdered.  Sure.  Interested in, you know, he wasn't feeling it.  But he got his way.  He went to the producers, and they took it out.  They were all cool, by the way.  I mean, Michael K. Williams was so, you know, no big deal.  Whatever.  When I watched that, believe me, I don't go, this would be better if he pissed on him.  I never would think of that anyway.  So I think it was perfect the way it was done.  Yeah, yeah.  We had pigeons and everything.  They were going, you know, the pigeons were supposed to fly, that whole cool thing.  And then they released the pigeons, and they kept running into the window. 
[02:29:00]  It was hysterical.  They had two dozen pigeons, and every time they released them, because they had the big  window in the back, they tried to fly out.  And they would just, like, smack into the window.  It was, you know, so everybody cracked up.  So that broke a lot of the tension, too.  Well, you knew, too, that it was, because the Wirefuck, I couldn't believe when they  killed D'Angelo in season two.  I couldn't believe when they killed this one.  That's when you knew you were watching something.  When they killed him off.  Yeah.  In the second season, you're like, what? 
[02:29:30]  He's not supposed to die.  David Simon, yeah.  He doesn't get sentimental about that.  It's about the story.  Right.  Which is what's so cool.  He was not sentimental about it.  He says, we're glad that you like the characters, and sometimes they'll write longer scenes.  But in terms of, it's the story.  When it's time to go, it's time to go.  It's time to go.  It's all about the story.  And the thing was, when you and Omar showed up together, you just knew it was going to  be a fucking problem for Stringer Bell.  You just knew that being in that house, doing a real estate deal with these two, this is 
[02:30:00]  not going to end well.  But they did it.  It was nice.  It was nice.  They did me right.  Do you get recognized a lot from that show?  I mean...  I do.  I do.  Still.  Still.  Do you wear the glasses when you're on a voucher?  Hell no.  Just so people recognize you.  The bow tie?  People recognize me without the bow tie and the glasses.  People recognize me with shades on.  I remember last week, I'm now friends with a brother from the Nation of Islam, Brother Cornelius.  Okay. 
[02:30:30]  He stands out on the corner from the subway, pretty much with the final call, their official  newspaper.  And I was just walking by one morning with my shades on and shorts and heading to the  subway.  He goes, oh, oh, oh, brother.  Brother.  Brother.  Wire.  Brother was on.  And so I'm, you know, and I'm thinking, oh, shit.  No.  It's going to...  These guys are not going to be happy.  It's going down.  These guys are not going to be happy.  Loved it though, right?  Yeah, he did.  I didn't...  You know, and that's my ignorance because I didn't think they got to watch TV like that 
[02:31:00]  or certainly not.  Right.  You know, network TV like that.  And he's all...  And so every time I see him, he's like, As-salamu alaykum.  And he's like, yo, brother, how you doing?  Tell me about this, brother.  Now, do you say alaykum salam or do you just kind of wave and go, hey?  No, I go...  One time I went alaykum salam because it kind of took me back from...  You know, I was like, oh, oh, yeah, that's the response to it.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  So...  Well, you represented, I thought, like, you know, you played a character and you represent  him as a strong character, but a pretty honest guy.  And, you know, even though you were in that line of work... 
[02:31:30]  In the game, yeah.  Murdering people, yeah.  Right, sure.  You know, it was so great, though, the way that he shoots you and you just won't go out  groveling.  You just won't.  It's amazing how different I am from all of these characters.  I just would have groveled.  Are you creeped out how much he knows about the wire?  Really, yeah.  The other guys that come in here, they're like, oh, man, I like doing the wire, but...  Sometimes they get the scene orders wrong.  I'm like, no, no, that's when you were doing this.  He's arguing, like, no, that was in season.  Whoa, okay.  Who did you say to somebody? 
[02:32:00]  No, that was season three, not four.  I was wrong with Michael K. Williams.  I thought he did something in season one, but he was right.  It was season two.  Right.  And, uh...  But he argued the point.  No, you were mistaken.  I know you were in the wire, but I'm telling you, I know.  Jamie Hector was wrong, though.  He thought something happened after a poker game.  And I'm like, no, that's when you lost the money.  And he's like, oh, yeah, you're right.  Well, yeah.  Probably, yeah, you guys who are fans know more about it than...  Michael, what do you do between the wire and the Book of Mormon?  I just did a lot of guest star stuff and other... 
[02:32:30]  Well, not a lot.  I mean, I did Law and Orders and I did, what, Bored to Death.  What did you...  I was on one episode of that, too.  What did you...  I was in last season.  I played the colonic hygienist.  I played, you know, I was the guy who gave Zach Galifianakis...  A colonic?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  The character's name, I think, was Yusef.  Okay.  What season was that?  That was the first season.  Okay.  Yeah, that was the first season.  And then I did a few episodes of Damages before they got moved off to direct television. 
[02:33:00]  Wait, that's Glenn Close's show?  Glenn Close's show.  We had her in recently.  She was promoting that and a charity.  Really cool.  Damages is still on, but...  It's still on, but they were...  They're no longer on FX.  They were sold off to DirecTV.  So they're on their network now.  Oh, I didn't know DirecTV had a network.  Yeah, they did.  Remember Friday Night Lights?  It left NBC, and DirecTV picked it up and ran it, and then it was able to come back to  network TV. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, wow.  So is that like a...  Like, I guess...  Is that like the area in the airport where they send you to de-ice?  Like, you're not on the runway to take off, but you're not back at the gate either.  I guess that's it.  And then you get the call for Book of Mormon.  Wow.  I know.  Did you know this thing was going to be a hit?  I knew it would be successful.  I didn't know it was going to be the biggest thing of the season.  Certainly, I didn't know it was going to blow up like that, but I did think it was going  to be successful.  I didn't even think I'd be in it, honestly. 
[02:34:00]  I'm sorry, Michael.  When you read the...  Because I don't want to give away what his first song is, just because it tells too much.  But let's just say...  It's a great song.  What is the name of the song?  Hasadiga Ibowai.  Okay, Hasadiga Ibowai.  Now, is that what you had to sing in the audition?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  It went by...  It was called something else.  Right.  It was a different African phrase before then.  So, yeah, I had to sing that.  And when, as you're reading it, are you realizing, like, this is actually, these lyrics are actually 
[02:34:30]  going...  Oh, I couldn't stop laughing.  I literally, I was sitting out when they first gave it to me, because they were, they're really  nervous about it.  They were like, we understand if, you know, maybe you want to read it a little bit, and  we understand it's not for everybody, and we can, you know, but if you'll just look  at it.  And I remember, I took it out, and you could just hear me howling around the corner.  It was like, you are not going to say this.  You are not going to say this.  You have, I think...  We don't want to give it away.  No, no, no, no, because it's, it's just...  It's such a great moment in the show.  Yeah, I would say Michael has the first jaw-dropping moment of the show. 
[02:35:00]  The first jaw-dropping...  The St. Elise.  But it just works.  It's, I can't believe the stuff that you guys get away with on that show.  I don't believe we get away with that stuff.  I really thought that I thought they'd be, for a while I would leave through the lobby  because I thought people would be out there ready to, you know, beat me to a pulp, and  I'm shocked. 
[02:35:30]  I'm shocked that there haven't been more protests.  The first...  Why do you...  I got a question maybe for Jimmy as well.  Why do you think it's so accepting?  Because it's pretty rough and edgy stuff at times, and it's on Broadway, and it's a hit  musical, and people are accepting this material.  I think people accept certain social parody and religious parody from certain areas.  Stand-ups more feel like they're hearing a real opinion, and they feel like they can  confront us on that.  South Park has almost been so accepted as parody, you almost look like an asshole criticizing 
[02:36:00]  them.  Right.  And I think Matt and Trey being attached to this, there is always the argument, you know  what you're in for, these guys did fucking South Park.  Right.  So I think that that's a big reason.  Well, we're talking about...  And it's new.  Yeah, well...  It's not like anything else.  But we're talking about baby fucking.  Yeah, there is baby...  Which is amazing.  If you think about it, I'm sure just saying that right now, people want...  That has been...  The subject of that is broached, yes.  And it works.  It works.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  Come on. 
[02:36:30]  People have been telling dead baby jokes forever.  They have.  Just not on Broadway in a musical form, just standing ovations.  Exactly.  That's what I'm getting at.  But again, it's not a musical based on a movie.  It's not based on somebody's songbook.  It's totally original.  And Broadway was starved for something new.  It's not a revival.  Right.  And when I knew I was seeing a good musical, first of all, it's over two hours and I didn't  mind.  And I never looked down to see how many songs were left.  See?  That's great.  I've been to musicals where you're like...  That's great. 
[02:37:00]  Three songs and you're like, how many more?  How many?  I know.  Oh, I got 12 more songs to sit through.  I didn't do that once.  Good.  Not a once.  You really feel...  And I don't like musicals.  I don't.  That's what I'm getting at, too, there.  Michael.  I want to go as far as to say...  This is going to help sell the show even more.  Thank you.  I'll go as far as to say I despise them.  Yeah.  And this is the best thing I've seen.  Literally, for someone who hates musicals to go to something and love it...  I've seen it twice.  Yeah.  Because we had Josh Gad.  But the first time I went and saw it, his understudy, I guess, was... 
[02:37:30]  Right.  So I went and saw it again later that week with him.  And it is fucking...  I can't stop talking about how great it was.  It's a great show.  It's a great thing.  It is brilliant and funny.  Smart.  Really smart.  So fucking smart.  Great satire.  There's callbacks in it.  It's brilliantly written.  And I went and bought the soundtrack.  You guys premiered at number three.  Lady Gaga must want to hang herself.  Like, she plummeted in the second week.  And you guys pop up at number three.  It's amazing.  Your first week.  Top ten.  Yeah.  Number three. 
[02:38:00]  Are you a singer?  Yeah.  Oh, so you were...  But not a...  But, you know, I don't...  Well, yeah.  You obviously got a huge song in the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But sometimes, you know, they train you to sing for some of these shows, right?  Yeah, they do.  I'm serious.  They do.  No, no.  Most...  Well, all the guys who are leads are pretty much trained singers.  You got a singing background.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, is your background in plays or in acting?  It's in both.  It's in plays.  It's not in musical theater.  No.  It was just...  I just happened to have a good voice.  I grew up in a house full of singers.  Wait, this is your first... 
[02:38:30]  No, it's not the first Broadway musical.  This is the third Broadway musical.  I've done maybe three or four other musicals off-Broadway or regionally like that.  But, no, my training was pretty much classical conservatory training.  It wasn't in musical.  And you have some really good...  There's some great acting moments between you.  I think her name is Nicky James.  Nicky M. James.  Nicky M. James.  Tony Award winning Nicky.  She did win, right?  She absolutely won.  Yeah, she did.  Tremendous.  Yeah, she was great.  It won nine...  It's like I've never raved about a musical.  Do you know how much fun this is to rave about a musical? 
[02:39:00]  Because people always talk about musicals.  I never want to see them.  It almost made me watch the Tonys.  Almost.  I knew the Tonys were on.  And I'm like, I might have to watch the Tonys this year.  We need the ratings.  You've got to watch.  Everybody, you've got to watch.  I almost watched.  It was a good broadcast this year.  We felt like we knew Josh Gad after he spent some time with us.  I'm like, I think I might have to watch this.  He's going to win.  He's a great guy.  And he was great.  And funny.  But it's like when you're watching this, it's like so many things I've seen. 
[02:39:30]  You're going, this is so good.  Please don't blow it.  Please don't fuck it up.  Like, you just don't want it to get ruined by something cheesy.  And then it's over and everybody stands.  And you're like, ugh, they didn't blow it.  They didn't.  They didn't.  I mean, and a lot of that, you know, they were riding to the last minute.  Really?  Very, very last minute.  So do you guys get standing ovations every show?  So far.  Knock on wood.  So far.  Yeah, I can't picture it.  Knock on wood.  We saw it, and Chevy Chase was in two rows in front of me, and he was to the right of Opie.  And it was funny watching him react. 
[02:40:00]  He was after.  I didn't watch him during the show, but after.  He was all in.  Like a child.  He was completely all in.  He came back after the show, and he hung out on stage with us.  Oh, really?  Good 15, 20 minutes.  He couldn't stop going on about it.  He was the first to stand the night we were there.  He couldn't wait to get up and give you guys a standing ovations.  He was just jumping and clapping and, like, throwing.  It was like watching a child react to something they liked.  It was great.  Yeah, it blows your mind.  And you look out, and Jim Carrey was the same way.  You know, he's lost his mind over it, and he started sending us orchids and candy and shit later. 
[02:40:30]  And then, who else?  People lose their mind.  Quentin Tarantino was losing it the entire show.  Because normally, I don't see people out in the house, because I can't, until about the end.  But all of a sudden, I kept seeing this head bobbing, and this person just laughing, you know, like in convulsion.  Does that play with your mind, though?  Quentin Tarantino.  Right, right.  It has to play with your mind.  Yeah.  Well, that's why I don't look out.  That's why I kind of try to stay in the scene.  I don't want to know.  But it happens by curtain call, you can see.  And sometimes the word filters back, and you go, what? 
[02:41:00]  Nancy Pelosi?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Harry Reid?  You've had some impressive.  Josh Gatz had one night.  Nicholson was there.  Yeah, he sent us, like, cake or something like that.  Oh, really?  He sent us something.  No, he sent us a case of Veuve Clicquot.  Something like that.  What is that, liquor?  Yeah, champagne.  He sent us champagne after.  Yeah, Glenn Close, we spoke about her.  She was there the other night, Mell Streep.  Justin Timberlake. 
[02:41:30]  Cameron Diaz has been twice.  Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher.  It just goes on, and it's kind of insane.  It really is.  It's like all of Hollywood.  Rachel Weisz, Daniel Craig.  Who made you the most nervous when you knew they were going to be there?  Oh, I didn't know ahead of time, so it really didn't bother me.  I just worried that, you know, Reverend Al Sharpton was going to come in.  They get really, really pissed.  Sharpton?  Are you kidding me?  I keep you talking to him.  He kicked Mormonism in the balls because of the way they viewed black people.  He would probably love it.  And that's a dress, too.  That's a dress in the play. 
[02:42:00]  It's like, wow, you forgot about that.  1978, it all kind of changed.  So I was waiting for the shooter to drop.  I was like, okay, God, Sharpton is going to come.  He's really going to kick asses about this.  No, Sharpton would love it.  How long are you going to be in the musical, do you think?  Well, I'm contracted for the year.  I mean, my contract ends, I think, in March.  And then we'll see from there.  Who's the Mormon, oh, God, the guy who might run for president?  Conservative.  Or he's going to run for president?  Mitt Romney.  Yeah.  I wondered, like, there will be eventually a touring company. 
[02:42:30]  And how would Mormons react to it?  Because it's harsh, but I mean, it's, you know, it's kind of, I think it's kind of giving  a good beating to religion in general, and I wonder if, like, how would it play in Salt  Lake if it would be well-received?  I don't know.  It may not.  It may not.  We've had some former Mormons, I think in the workshops I've done with it, even in this  show, there have been former Mormons in it, and they're cool.  Some of their brothers and sisters who are still Mormons weren't too pleased with it. 
[02:43:00]  Right.  They were a little nervous about it.  But a lot of older Mormons, a lot of older former Mormons love it.  They've come two or three times to see it, and they dig it.  They understand it.  They're trying to be impartial about it as much as they can.  They say, well, okay, we understand this, and we see this, and we see this.  And I think the Mormon religion, the establishment, is starting to embrace the show more because  it's taking away that cult status.  Right.  You know, we all think that they just marry and have babies and have 10 or 12 wives. 
[02:43:30]  So if anything, the show is bringing them mainstream.  And it makes them less scary.  I'm sorry about that.  It makes them seem like, the hierarchy is a little annoying, but it makes average Mormons  seem like nice people.  Yeah.  It doesn't make them look like dickheads.  It makes them look like nice guys who are a little naive about certain things, but meaning  well.  You're right.  You're right.  And I think the Mormon establishment is picking that up.  That's what they're getting from it.  Do you have a favorite moment in the play?  Like, if you could be an audience member, I mean, there's so many amazing moments. 
[02:44:00]  There are amazing moments, but I just find Man Up cracks me up.  That's all.  Man Up is great.  That's the one that Josh does at the end of Act One, the kind of mock, you know, rock  shit, you know.  And that just cracks me up when Josh starts singing that, you know, what did Jesus do?  Right.  He crawled up on that cross and stuck it out.  Yeah, took it on the chin.  And Larry, I mean, took it on the chin.  Me and Jimmy.  That's awesome.  We go back and forth with it.  Turn it off.  We're obsessed.  We're doing it in our regular lives now to each other. 
[02:44:30]  Turn it off.  That one moment.  Who's the guy who's fighting being gay in the play?  What's his name?  That would be Elton McKinley played by Rory O'Malley.  Fucking hilarious.  Isn't he?  Oh, that with the whole turn it off.  Yeah.  What did he say?  You're getting gay thoughts like every day.  Turn it off.  He does this thing where he's...  He's just find the box that's gay and crush it.  He's crushing it.  He's screaming.  He's trying to convince himself he's not gay.  We've got to give this little thing away so people pick up on it.  And then there's a scene where maybe people will have to pack and leave. 
[02:45:00]  And he comes through the stage with his pink luggage.  Oh, my God.  I know.  A great callback that I hope everyone picks up on.  Yeah, I don't think a lot of people will pick it up.  They do.  Oh, they do.  Some of those subtle things, you wonder if everyone is picking up on it.  No, no, no.  They get it.  The guy fighting being gay is also great.  There's so many great...  I got like a little...  Watching Nikki M. James sing, you can't help but get a little choked up.  It's like, fuck, am I going to cry during this?  It's embarrassing.  It's a comedy.  She's great.  She's the heart of the show. 
[02:45:30]  She's the heart of the whole thing.  Right.  Is she involved with anybody?  Yes, she is.  Hey.  Yeah, I really did.  I kind of liked it.  I watched her twice.  She's very talented.  She's in tremendous shape.  There's no reason she would like me at all.  But now I'm kind of happy.  You don't know.  You don't know.  You do.  You never do.  She's involved, but nothing lasts forever.  I like that.  Give her a call.  Bring her in.  We should have to give her some encouragement.  Like, hey, look, things could fall apart, as they do.  You can go back and tell her we're nice, and she should do our show. 
[02:46:00]  I'm going to tell her that.  She needs to do your show.  We would love to have some people...  We would love to meet...  We want more Book of Mormon guys.  We'd love to have her.  We'd love to have...  Andrew, his name is?  Andrew.  Yeah.  There's a couple other guys, too.  We'd love to have the guy who played the doctor, the guy who played Buttfuck Naked.  But you know what?  That's real.  I mean, a lot of African warlords take these bizarre names that are considered profanity  in other places.  The only thing that was different that these guys, I think, was there was a general Butt  Naked. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, really?  And so they put fucking in the middle of it, but there was...  Buttfucking Naked, right.  But there was a general, I believe, called Butt Naked.  Yeah, they take...  I don't know what the purpose of taking that name was.  Maybe they knew what it translated to or whatever, but there was something that was very true  about that.  Yeah.  That was another last minute thing that came in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's right.  They dug up and found that, of course.  How could they not?  Yeah, you kind of have to.  How could they not use it?  It's just another thing that you can't believe is being said on a Broadway stage. 
[02:47:00]  It's like watching...  That's okay.  The audience is sitting there wanting to know.  Dude, it's 70-year-old women are laughing.  That's what's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean, there are 70- and 80-year-old women in the second row who are just like, want to  make sure they catch everything.  Good.  You're having the best time.  Cosby translates to everybody's side.  Guys that are clean.  Robin Williams, you see 30-year-olds and 60-year-olds.  Right.  But nothing that has the content of this I've ever seen get laughs from everybody. 
[02:47:30]  It's universal.  Little kids, you know, to watch their faces sometimes.  Yeah, hearing the words.  The jaw drop.  Do they warn people when they're coming in?  Yeah.  They let them know.  There's some warnings.  They tell me, you know, you have to know.  You have to know.  Warn your kids.  They don't suggest it for kids, but some people...  I was walking by the theater the other night, and that line...  There's a line every night, people hoping to get in.  For cancellations.  Because this thing is sold out through, I don't even know...  September or something?  It's almost the rest of the year at this point.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  So they wait online, hoping someone doesn't show up, and they can get in.  And you can get tickets by...  Or you can try to get tickets at bookofmormonbroadway.com.  It's one word.  Bookofmormonbroadway.com.  And it's the only thing I can think of that I've seen that I heard so much hype about that  was actually better than I thought it would be.  Like, I was worried it would let me down, and it was better than people had said it was.  Oh, man.  And I can't recommend it high enough.  It's fucking...  Colin saw it before I did.  And he goes, it's fucking brilliant.  And it really is. 
[02:48:30]  It's just...  I've not heard one bad word about it from anybody.  I know you want to see the original, guys, but they should just get another cast and,  I don't know, knock on the door of Sister Act and say, hey, we're taking over your theater  for Book of Mormon 2 or something.  Imagine having two shows.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  It'll be on the show.  You'll have another cast, and, you know, hopefully they'll open up companies in other places.  And that's what they do, right?  Well, it's funny you should mention that, because the night you went and Josh wasn't there,  tell them the story of the old woman.  It's pretty funny. 
[02:49:00]  Jason, the guy's name is?  The guy who's under Josh?  He's...  Jared.  The understudy.  Jared?  Yeah.  Jared Gertner.  Okay.  He...  They announced...  And I didn't know who...  What...  Josh Gad was.  So, they say the name of it tonight, the part of Elder Cunningham we played by, and this  woman next to her, I was next to a 60-year-old woman and her 30-year-old daughter, and she  goes, ah, this blows!  This blows!  She was fucking miserable! 
[02:49:30]  I couldn't believe she was saying, this blows!  And I'm like, well, you know, I'm sure he'll be fine.  She's like, this blows!  I was so happy.  She was disappointed.  But she loved the play.  She loved it.  Because he did a great job as the understudy, Jimmy Tulling, right?  But I said, this guy's great.  Like, I remember as the break came, the intermission came, I'm like, this is great.  The guy's really good.  And she goes, yeah, but she got...  But it blows.  It blows.  She's the guy nominated for the Tony.  Oh, it's been a big trip into New York, spoiled by the news. 
[02:50:00]  But she loved it.  It blows.  It blows.  Oh, she was fucking...  Okay.  She's got a lot of money.  Yeah, I know.  She spent a lot of money.  But you know what?  She'll be back.  She'll be back to see Josh's version.  She will.  And she loved it.  It wasn't like she didn't laugh or enjoy it.  Right.  She gave in to the fact that it wasn't going to be the guy.  Right.  What was written in the play just won her over.  Did the rest of the theater hear her yell it?  I don't know if they did because the music started.  Yeah.  She was really angry. 
[02:50:30]  It was so funny.  I've never heard this blows from anybody over 40.  It was a classic.  So I guess...  Are we done, right?  The show is...  Are we done for the day?  Yeah, we'll figure it out after the break, I guess.  All right.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Because we're supposed to leave at 9 o'clock today, but we...  Yeah, but we didn't want to leave.  Thank you.  With Michael Potts going in today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He plays...  What is the name of your character?  Mafala Hatimbi.  Okay, there's no way I was going to pull that out today.  No way.  Mafala Hatimbi.  And he's one of the leads in Book of Mormon and has a tremendous role. 
[02:51:00]  He's great.  For anyone that's Wire fans like we are, he was Brother Muzon, but go see him in this  BookOfMormonBroadway.com.  You've been hearing us talk about it.  He's here just for us because they can't get tickets, Jimmy.  I know.  We brought them in just for us.  We brought them in just for us.  I think some tickets opened up in like August of 2012 or something I heard.  A friend of mine emailed said, yeah, a block of tickets.  But you know what?  You might as well get on the list because people do get in that aren't supposed to get  in.  And for everyone that doesn't get in, there's 10 people that bought tickets and don't show 
[02:51:30]  up.  Or, you know, hopefully stalled out in the Lincoln Tunnel.  Iraq wants me to play track four.  I don't think...  What is track four?  It's the big song.  No.  Yeah, I don't think we should do that.  No, you can't, Iraq.  Even though it's great, you don't want to...  We don't do spoilers.  Nah, you don't want...  We just want to spoil the crap out of stuff for people.  Okay, yeah, don't do it.  No, no, you don't.  We don't do that anymore, though, Michael.  Yeah, no, no, no.  We turned over a new leaf.  Just go see it.  Yeah, good, good.  They don't want...  Nah, they wouldn't want you to spoil it.  Enjoy it.  Don't worry, we're not going to do it. 
[02:52:00]  Go see it and enjoy it.  We would love to play Michael's song, but it's...  You should just go see it and believe me.  Yeah, you need to have the experience.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You need to be surprised by it.  It took me off guard, so you wanted to take everybody else off guard.  Yeah, it's a pleasure.  Michael Potts, everyone.  My pleasure.  Thank you.  From the Book of Mormon.  You want to promote anything else?  Any side stuff?  You're all good?  No, I'm all good.  I'm all good.  I think they'd really be pissed at me if I tried.  Okay.  Well, you're tremendous, man.  You're a really great actor and a great singer.  I just loved what you did.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Michael Potts, everyone. 
[02:52:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Come on.  So, Michael Potts was cool.  We're still here, by the way.  We're live.  You liked Michael there, Jimmy?  I really liked him a lot.  He was very engaging, and he seemed to embrace both roles that I loved him in, which is great. 
[02:53:00]  Thanks for correcting me in front of him.  About what?  He was asking about all the characters from The Wire that have been in here.  Oh, you said Dodie, right?  Yeah, and you had to make sure that you corrected me in front of him.  No, but I had to.  Now I feel like an idiot.  I had to say Bodie.  And I know it was Bodie.  I didn't want you to say Dodie again.  Because it just sounded horrible.  It had to be corrected.  You said Dodie.  To the guy, one of the guys.  Yeah, we haven't had Dodie in yet. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  What a dick.  Yeah, you got to.  Oh, my real fucking piece of work.  That's right.  You just panic a little.  You get nervous.  The mayor up there in Boston.  There's a t-shirt controversy.  Have you heard about this?  Yes.  You have?  Yeah, that stupid get high.  What's wrong with that?  I thought he wants to take it out of the fucking window of Newberry Comics.  It's like, come on.  I think that t-shirt or some form of that t-shirt or that type of t-shirt has been in Newberry Comics forever. 
[02:54:00]  Ever since we were up there.  So what's the big deal now?  Do we know?  It's just somebody noticed it.  That's it.  It's in the window.  Somebody complained.  Well, Joe Shortsleeve, thank God, got to the bottom of this.  Who?  Joe Shortsleeve.  Who's that?  Well, if my memory serves me correctly, when Ant and I were in Boston, Joe Shortsleeve was the weatherman.  Get it? 
[02:54:30]  You're the weather guy and your name is Joe Shortsleeve.  Who's the traffic guy?  Frank, drunk driving accident?  I don't know.  All right.  And Shortsleeve decided, I want to do more than weather.  So the name Joe Shortsleeve sort of works for weather, I guess.  But it certainly doesn't work if now you're going to be a journalist or a news reporter doing serious news. 
[02:55:00]  Let's go to Joe Shortsleeve.  It's awful.  Why didn't he change his name?  It's terrible.  So he got to the bottom of this controversy with the t-shirt.  And I guess the mayor's involved.  And I wish Ant was here because, you know, Mayor Menino and us, we have such a terrific relationship.  This is how it went down.  Boston Mayor Tom Menino is taking on Nike Town.  He doesn't like the new window.  Oh, it's Nike Town, Jimmy.  Does that make this different?  Nope.  I don't know.  I thought it was Newberry Comics.  Okay.  Nike Town.  A new window display at Nike's Newberry Street store. 
[02:55:30]  As chief correspondent Joe Shortsleeve shows us, the mayor says the display sends the absolute wrong message to young people.  Menino says he was walking in the back bay with his wife recently when he was shocked to see t-shirts in a high-end window display with expressions like dope and get high.  But there it was at the Nike store on Newberry Street.  The dope t-shirt actually has what appears to be a prescription bottle of pills falling over.  And angry Menino says they blatantly promote something that's very dangerous just in an effort to sell t-shirts. 
[02:56:00]  They're offensive to anybody who has any good common sense.  They encourage drugs.  It's not offensive to anyone.  Who is it offensive to?  No one.  I'm surprised Nike would do that, by the way.  They're pretty much an up-and-up corporation.  They're the only ones with balls enough to stand by Tiger.  I mean, when he got in trouble.  I mean, he knows an out-of-touch old man.  He really is out-of-touch.  Shut the fuck up.  How about you worry about all the corruption in Boston and the nepotism?  Right.  How about you fucking worry about that? 
[02:56:30]  Are people really bothered by something like that when they walk by?  No.  See, I still know a little bit about Boston.  Newberry Street is known for being a little hipper and a little, like, more open-minded than other streets in Boston, too.  You know?  That guy's just an asshole.  He's just an asshole.  He is.  That's what he is.  He's an asshole.  The mayor shot off a letter to the store's general manager asking her to remove the shirts from the window.  Your window display of t-shirts with drug and profanity wordplay are out of keeping with the character of Boston's back bay, our entire city. 
[02:57:00]  However, Nike's not budging in a statement to WBZ.  WBZ, Nike said, these t-shirts are part of an action sports campaign.  Nike does not condone the use of banned or illegal substances.  But the mayor sees it this way.  There's a fine line between edgy and stupid.  Yeah.  By the way, why are they laughing at that?  Because the mayor is considered stupid up there, right?  But they keep re-electing him.  This asshole is the same one, the only city that overreacted.  That guy, Opie and Anthony, fired? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  But the same ones that reacted to the guy, all the guys doing that light art.  The light bright.  They were the ones who reacted poorly.  He's a fucking, just an ass.  I'm glad Nike's telling them to go fuck himself.  Good, they should.  It's not his business.  Now the mayor kind of looks stupid.  What is he going to do?  What can I do?  Keep babbling, fat face.  Right.  Oh, there it is.  It's on CNN.  Okay, wow.  All he's doing now, this asshole, is now promoting this brand that everybody wants to get it.  Yeah, Nike's now saying, thank you. 
[02:58:00]  Thank you very much for all the free advertising we're getting on CNN as we look up.  Oh, how great is that?  These dummies.  And now the mayor just has to say something and try to move on awkwardly.  Good.  They told him no.  Yeah, good for Nike for not backing down.  Absolutely not.  We need more people not backing down in this society.  They don't want to be pushed around by that fucking dildo.  Right.  Do we have Line of the Day ready?  Yes.  Two runners on.  We really do?  Of course.  Oh, this is exciting.  We're bringing back Line of the Day today.  Yay.  Well, I mean, I don't know. 
[02:58:30]  Unless we're calling it something else.  No.  Well, we are, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  We are.  Oh, no.  Do you have the old Line of the Day song, which was sufficient for this fine radio show?  You're going to have to listen to the replay, I guess, because we get into it a little bit.  You want it as an example?  Yes.  Here's the original Line of the Day song that Jimmy put together nicely.  And the boys.  Go ahead.  Here comes the Line of the Day. 
[02:59:00]  Line of the Day.  Perfect, right?  Yeah.  And that's what the listeners remember and know.  It just works.  But it got back to us today.  You'll have to listen to the replay.  That Line of the Day just kind of sits there, and maybe we could punch or pump.  Punch?  Punch it up a bit.  Yeah.  And come up with another name.  And I believe one of our fine listeners came up with a new name for Line of the Day.  And then the boys ran into the production studio, and now we've got the stinger for the new name of Line of the Day. 
[02:59:30]  Is that okay with everyone?  It's perfect.  Here it is.  We debut it here.  Here comes something funny that was said on the show today because we're here and live and on a vacation.  Sue and the company.  And before we get in trouble, a listener came up with that.  Well, they told us to punch it up, so we punched it up. 
[03:00:00]  They suggested.  All right.  And we decided that was a good idea.  Are we going to call it this now?  I mean, I guess that's up to you.  Or do they come running down this hall begging us to just keep it at Line of the Day?  That will be the question that will be answered sometime today.  Or how about this?  Perhaps until they come back and admit that Line of the Day was perfect, perhaps every day there's a new name for this bit.  Yes.  Good idea, Jimmy.  Good idea.  Every day there's a new bit of production. 
[03:00:30]  And hopefully until they find one they like.  That's a very good idea.  Or they could just throw in the towel now and say Line of the Day is good enough for us.  We admit.  How about this?  We admit, accept, and apologize for suggesting that you fixed something that wasn't broke.  Word.  We apologize.  Word.  You want to hear the runner-up Line of the Day?  Love to.  Wait.  The runner-up Line.  I'm just going to say Line of the Day. 
[03:01:00]  Is that okay with everyone?  For familiarity.  Just for today.  All right.  And then maybe right on the screen for tomorrow.  This is the second runner-up.  Second runner-up for Line of the Day.  Mr. Varley, who's the barkeeper, I guess, admits to trying the drink himself, which he said was okay and like custard.  Oh, man.  It's all thick.  Consistency of custard.  You could make a pie out of it.  Yeah.  That'd make a good pie filling.  We had come pie after we said I was sorry. 
[03:01:30]  I brought it over as an apology gesture.  I said I'm sorry, and I brought up a come pie for everybody.  I forgot that Line of the Day is actually bit of the day.  Yeah, they show context.  Which makes it even more confusing for everyone.  But there needs to be.  We can't just play come pie.  I know.  Sure.  I think that's what makes it funny.  Check out the context.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  Whatever you guys want to do.  I don't care.  Come pie in the face is a funny old bit.  And let's acknowledge that Jimmy does a pretty damn good Tracy Morgan trying it out for the  first time today.  Yeah.  I've done it on stage a couple times, but it'll never be convincing like Brewers or Dean Edwards, 
[03:02:00]  but it's just, it's passable enough where people know who I'm talking about.  Yeah, absolutely.  I can't do a long bit.  All right.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  Yes.  Well, she was probably worried about dying in the ambulance.  Yeah.  You want to hear something really hot?  She was 10.  I was.  See, that was perfect.  That was perfect. 
[03:02:30]  I missed line of the day.  So you're going to need to play the song again.  Oh, okay.  Yay.  Keep it with tradition.  And then the line of the day comes.  All right.  So it's time for line of the day, but it's now called something else.  This song will explain what it's called.  Okay, good.  Here comes something funny that was said on the show today.  Because we're here and live and on a vacation.  Sue and the company. 
[03:03:00]  Here's something funny that was said despite the cunts in management.  That's the line of the day.  There was supposed to be a stinger in the line.  Let's see.  Where's the stinger?  You guys are doing it all wrong.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  I don't mind that they think we think they're cunts. 
[03:03:30]  But now they're here.  I like doing all my dirty work when they're still sleeping or on their way to work.  That's always a replay.  Now we've got to see them.  It's the line of the day.  I guess you're right.  Wait.  What was the stinger that was supposed to be played?  Fuck you!  That was Bobo.  Getting all mad at me and Danny.  All right.  Well, I think we did it for today.  Yeah, that was very silly.  You got anything you're promoting, Jimmy? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, I completely forgot.  A couple things.  I will be in Seattle July 1st with Jim Brewer, Bill Burr, and Natal for Antisocial.  How was the interview with BJ Shea, my old pal?  It was good.  It's always good.  Is he hanging in there?  He's doing great.  Good.  And then Vegas, July 3rd for the same lineup, Antisocial.  And I hope tonight be in Caroline's Comedy Club doing Adam Carolla's podcast.  It's a 7.30 show.  I don't know what time I go on or what we do, if I'm just talking to him or what, but 
[03:04:30]  it's 7.30 tonight.  So you can go see that live?  At Caroline's, yes.  If there's tickets, because Carolla's a pretty big fan base.  That's very cool.  And speaking of Vegas, I forgot to mention, we couldn't get to it.  There's a guy that owns a helicopter.  I already know the answer, but he wants to take you around in a helicopter when you're  in Vegas.  Not happening.  Yeah.  Jimmy's not a helicopter guy.  Helicopters scare me.  Scares the shit out of you, right?  Yeah, they do.  Scare me.  I took a helicopter through the Grand Canyon.  Yeah, that would frighten me.  Unless I knew it was a good one.  I was scared.  I would go in a police helicopter, because police horses, you know, they're maintained well. 
[03:05:00]  These tour ones, the ones that just do tours, they take off and land so often, I'm afraid  that the maintenance suffers.  Well, I did one over the Hudson River, and that, I believe it's the same company, they  had a pretty serious crash, what, last summer, right?  But I don't know if that was anybody's fault.  That was the plane, I think.  That was when they collided with the little planes.  Yeah, which is very scary.  That was in the wrong fucking place.  Yeah, that was the plane's fault.  That's right.  Or the, no, maybe it was the air traffic control. 
[03:05:30]  You know, I don't like helicopters.  Are they scary to get, like, sucked up like that?  Like, zzzz.  It just reminds me of, like, when I'm on an outdoor elevator and I'm going up fast, I  feel like it's going to overshoot the building.  It is a cool feeling, but it's such a foreign feeling is the problem.  Like, we've all been in enough planes where you understand everything.  Yeah.  In a helicopter, you feel it, like, kind of rocking back and forth and stuff, and you  don't understand what all that shit means.  So it scares you a little more, I think.  I would do it, though.  You should do it.  Maybe that guy is legit. 
[03:06:00]  I'm sure he's legit, but I...  No, I mean, like, a cop or something, what you need.  If he's a cop, I'd go up with him.  Um, or a guy that...  But the tour company stands out.  Aren't you guys filming stuff on tour now?  A little bit, yeah.  So why don't you film, like, one of those crazy rides out there in Vegas?  You guys all do that.  I'm not going on that fucking thing that my ex jumped off of, the fucking, uh...  Luxor thing?  Uh, no.  Luxor?  It's Stratosphere.  Stratosphere one.  What is that?  The bungee cord?  It's a free fall from 900 feet. 
[03:06:30]  Um, I would for money.  It's 120 bucks.  You go up, I think it's like 120 stories.  No, it's about 90 stories.  It's about 900 feet.  16 seconds, the draw.  Is it 16 seconds?  Yeah, it's like the fish line, and you just feel like you just jump, and it slows you down  near the end.  No, it slows you down at the end.  At the end.  But it's a weird...  You're hooked in with two lines.  She said the scariest part.  Was just stepping off?  Well, no, it's right before you do it.  It's like you're in the Stratosphere, which is circular, and you're looking down, and it's 
[03:07:00]  like looking from the top of the Trade Center.  I mean, it's 100 feet lower, but I mean, you can't tell from that height.  And you step...  What happens is the door opens, and they have you step out onto a fucking...  Like on the plank, and your feet are over the edge, and you're hooked in with two different...  Like one wire breaks, you have two.  And to your right, falling with you, is a camera filming you.  It would just scare me to see that hovering that high up.  And we've seen the videos online.  Because the camera's falling with you, it doesn't look like it's that big of a deal. 
[03:07:30]  I would rather see the footage where the camera's stationary, and you go flying by it.  Well, I have the shot from the bottom of her coming down.  Did it look like she was falling?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was at night.  It was harder.  There wasn't none during the day available.  During the day, it would be easier.  Is it better to go during the day?  You see more, and you'd probably get more of a perspective on falling.  I'm not going to see shit, because my eyes will be closed.  At night's probably better.  I would love to go at night.  But I got her falling.  You could just see like a little dot, and all of a sudden, dot, dot, there she is. 
[03:08:00]  It's like that fast.  Then they have the new, where you could go, Freemont Street, where you could do ziplines above everybody while they're walking.  Yeah, I would do ziplines.  In Vegas?  Yeah.  How high is it?  You're like 50 feet above everybody.  That's cool.  Could you zipline from casino to casino?  Not yet.  Like, that could be your transportation.  Yeah, monorails they have.  No, I know they have the monorails, but.  Cosmo, what's that?  Let me see.  Try it this way.  Sam, I'll kiss you on the mouth and neck. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, I mean, that's from the ground that's taken.  Look at how high you are.  We're looking at the ledge, and where she jumps off.  That's free-falling, all right.  You're free-falling.  But you see that you've got two wires holding you in.  That's a controlled fall.  You're falling for quite a while.  Still falling, still falling, still falling.  I'm going to stop you.  How much does that cost?  100 bucks, 120 bucks.  And they only have one spot? 
[03:09:00]  They should have four or five different spots.  No, they shouldn't.  Why not?  That just scares me.  Because they could be making a shitload of money, even more.  It's just scary.  Like, uh...  Oh, my God, look at that.  That is a free-fall.  And you're falling all the way until...  No, no.  ...the bottom.  Like, look at...  They literally stop you 20 feet or 30 feet above the ground.  You're falling quickly until you're 30 feet, maybe 50,  but you're falling the whole fucking time.  Would you ever skydive?  I've... 
[03:09:30]  It sounds appealing.  No, I would not.  I would never skydive.  I would not.  Oh, who is this?  It's Kenny.  Kenny, what do you want?  They have an indoor ride in Vegas where you put on, like,  a nylon parachute suit, and there's, like, a big turbine jet engine,  and you can, like...  Oh, that I would do.  On the floor?  I'd floor dive.  No, those are cool.  You're, like, in a padded room.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Would I fucking rubber room dive?  Like a champ.  So why don't you do that in Vegas?  I didn't know about it until fucking Kenny just came over.  Yeah, you get in the middle of this rubber room,  and then they turn on the engine, 
[03:10:00]  and it pushes you up no more than 10, 12 feet.  Oh, that'd be great.  See, the rubber room, though, like, we're all bouncing and stuff.  See you tomorrow.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
