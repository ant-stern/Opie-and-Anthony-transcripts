<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and a female co-host, Ann, discussing the absurdity of workplace security protocols. This segued into a scathing, profanity-laced critique of Rick Santorum's presidential campaign and his subsequent request for help paying off campaign debts, extending to broader disgust with the political process and politicians in general.  They also touched on the Buffett Rule and their opinions on taxation and government spending.  The conversation then shifted to Ozzie Guillen's suspension from the Miami Marlins for praising Fidel Castro, sparking a debate about free speech, its limitations, and the rights of corporations. They used examples like displaying Nazi flags and offensive jokes about sensitive topics to illustrate the complexities of the issue. A caller, Dan,  weighed in on corporations' right to protect their image.

The show then featured Joel McHale as a guest.  The discussion moved to the feud between Chevy Chase and the *Community* cast and crew, playing voicemails from Chase where he criticized the show and its creator, Dan Harmon.  McHale responded, expressing frustration with the editing process.  The conversation included lighter moments discussing The Cure, McHale's fitness routine, parenting, and  speculation about the motivations behind the released voicemails.

The next segment saw a rambling discussion jumping between topics, including Adam Baldwinâ€™s menacing character portrayals, war movies like *Saving Private Ryan* and *Full Metal Jacket*,  and the contrast between high-quality shows (*Game of Thrones*, *Breaking Bad*) and low-quality reality TV.  McHale, still present, discussed his work on *The Soup* and *Community*, interactions with celebrities, and upcoming appearances on *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*.  The hosts and McHale criticized *Toddlers & Tiaras* and shared their guilty pleasure TV shows, including prison documentaries.  A significant portion was dedicated to a comedically interrupted trailer for *The Five-Year Engagement*.  Bob Kelly, another guest, promoted his stand-up shows.  The segment concluded with continued promotion of McHale and Kelly's upcoming engagements.

The following segment focused on a bandolier designed to carry personal items, discussed in detail with a crude, often interrupted conversation involving Jimmy Norton.  Humorous scenarios involving its use were imagined, before the discussion devolved into increasingly graphic and offensive online videos featuring bodily fluids, specifically a prolonged description of a cyst being drained.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Norton's stand-up performances and TV work, interspersed with listener calls.


Finally, a segment featured a "white guy" actor from *The Wire* recounting a frightening experience while filming in the Bronx, involving getting lost and feeling threatened near Yankee Stadium late at night. He detailed his fear and hiding until a production van arrived. The hosts reacted with profane humor to his story. The segment concluded with promotion of the Firefly Music Festival.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning.  Morning, Anthony.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Wednesday.  I just saw him in the bathroom.  His tissue is tucked around his collar.  He's primping.  Why does he do like it's a photo shoot?  I know. No one's coming in here and taking video of him. 
[00:00:30]  He dresses very well. He dresses better than all of us.  Come on.  It's very odd. I walked in. I saw the podium. There was no one standing there, which is always a little disappointment for me.  Security breach.  Yeah, security breach. But more so, I want my welcome.  Yeah.  And right when me and Kenny were walking into the door to get into the hallway back here, he almost came running in and went,  Welcome aboard! Welcome aboard!  I'm like, ah, that made me feel better. 
[00:01:00]  He likes you.  Yeah.  He definitely likes you.  I got a double good morning.  Damn.  I forgot my ID, so Kenny met me downstairs.  And we came in as he was walking back into his vestibule.  Right.  And he gave me the, uh, good morning, good morning for both of us.  And I threw, I almost threw it right.  I was like, good morning, good morning.  Yeah, yeah.  Do it.  I do that. He likes that.  Good morning.  It's funny about the, uh, the security badges, because yesterday I forgot mine.  And the guy downstairs let me through, because he sees me every morning.  But I was telling these guys, wouldn't that be the scenario to come up here and do some shit? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  The day after you get fired, you don't have a badge, you go, oh, look, I don't have my badge today, and they let you up?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Proving that that whole security thing, that every building in New York and probably most of the buildings in the country at this point.  It's farcical.  It's just, it is.  It is.  That's the perfect word.  It's fake.  It's a goof.  I don't think they're really doing anything.  No.  It's pretty much they're amounting to the see something, say something thing.  Exactly.  It's just busy buddy work. 
[00:02:00]  Busy buddies.  You know?  Yeah.  Oh, what the hell kind of hat does he have on today?  It's the San Diego Padres.  Oh, right.  The Padres.  Now he's cycling through his hats.  SD, Sam's a douche.  Yeah, that's right.  Sam douche.  Sam's hat.  Hat.  Sam's hat.  It's hat.  Santorum's out of the race.  That's the big headline today.  Oh, that's very good.  That's very good.  Great news.  But it's amazing.  Like all these other creeps, he wants some help paying off his campaign debt. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  What?  That's interesting.  It's what they do.  Oh, I didn't know that.  It's legalized prostitution.  Can you imagine that?  Is he setting up a PayPal account?  He drops out.  With his story?  Like Zimmerman.  Right.  He drops out, and then he asks Mitt for help paying off.  And Hillary did it with Obama.  It's typical.  But it's like, wasn't this scumbag just talking about less government?  Right.  Yeah.  And then he drops out, and he doesn't mind fucking begging with his hat in his hand. 
[00:03:00]  Look, you should be-  Yeah, pay for my shit.  Pay your fucking bills.  Yeah, you should be in the poorhouse.  You went for the presidency.  None of us could go for the presidency, because no one would pay our fucking debt.  Yeah.  So you should be in the poorhouse.  You lost.  Oh, well.  See you later.  Now, will Romney do-  Well, basically what that is saying is, if you do this, I will throw my support to you  and bring as many of my financial backers and support.  Is that how that works?  Oh, exactly.  It's such a fucking shell game, and Romney will pay it, because Romney can afford it. 
[00:03:30]  He'll easily pay it.  Romney's going to pay his bill.  And then Santorum will be like, and Romney's the man we need to run the country.  But we got a montage of Santorum trashing the hell out of Romney.  Now, that's only when they're in the race.  Now, when they're out, everything's fine.  But no one's going to pay attention to them.  No, no.  Where's the honesty?  There is none, and it's totally based on money.  Does Santorum think he's a good candidate or not?  Because they just played on MSNBC a montage of Santorum just killing Romney.  And now we're going to have to listen to Santorum get in front of a podium and praise him? 
[00:04:00]  And say, he's the man for us, isn't he?  And as Americans, we just accept this crap.  Apparently so.  And by the way, what's his name?  MSNBC doing that?  They won't do it to Democratic candidates, but they do do the same thing.  It's why you hate politicians.  I mean, like when Hillary dropped out, didn't she ask for help?  As much money as her and Bill have.  Yeah.  It's tradition.  You ask for money.  You basically say, look, everything I've stood for is shit. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Right.  And I will gladly put your dick in my mouth if you pay my bill.  Unbelievable.  God, they're all such cocks.  I hate the whole process.  That is so terrible.  I hate the whole process.  I was telling Ann, I officially don't have a guy in this race.  I'm not an Obama guy.  A lot of people out there kind of think I lean toward an Obama.  Obama?  I might lean toward that party if I had to answer the question.  But I don't want Romney.  I don't want Obama. 
[00:05:00]  I think our choices fucking suck.  Yeah, they usually do because you're whittled down to, you know, two guys.  It's ridiculous when you think, hey, we have two guys to choose from?  Out of everyone that would actually be eligible to be president, only two guys every four years are the ones that you really get to vote for.  Don't fucking hit me with your independent guy shit.  I know.  But, you know, we're really working with a two-party system here. 
[00:05:30]  I hate the Buffett rule.  The Buffett rule is fucking ridiculous.  What exactly is the rule?  Basically, if you make over a million dollars a year, they want 30 percent.  Is that it, Ann?  Oh, that's crazy.  You know more about this shit than me.  That's just a federal.  You're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Obama's given a speech yesterday.  But if you've worked hard your whole life and you've got a million in the bank, we're not going to touch that.  Oh, no.  We're just going after anyone that goes, you know, makes over a million a year.  Oh, you'll just touch the shit that I make with the money I have in the bank. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Don't fucking make it sound like they're not taking your money that you already have.  They're constantly doing that.  And my issue is, yeah, I want to keep more of my money, just like any person listening to my voice right now.  There's not a person alive that wants to give the government more money.  So shut up.  Yeah, that's just bullshit.  And it just shows how ridiculous our system is and where is all this money going?  It's time to ask the questions.  Where is it?  That's the big story.  No one's life is getting better, but they continue to take a shitload of, you know, money from every single one of us. 
[00:06:30]  It doesn't matter how much money you make.  You're losing a lot of it to the government.  And all these people that talk about, like, Obama and racism, that's my issue.  I want more of my money.  That's it.  In the end, we all do.  We all do.  Because guess what?  You know, this Buffett rule, when they, let's say it goes through, I don't know, I doubt if it will at this point, you know, then they're going to move that number down and eventually they're going to get to you. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  It's never enough because they don't know how to spend our fucking money is what I'm convinced.  No, when you give them more money, they fuck up and they screw you harder.  Right.  They're like, well, now they just spend more of it.  Right.  Badly.  What about that fucking Vegas trip that they took?  The government agency.  And then they spent like $800,000 on parties and everything.  That's taxpayer money.  Yeah, I know it is.  Parties and gifts and fucking.  And it's not enough. 
[00:07:30]  So they got to kind of figure out other ways to get more from us.  And I mean from us, meaning all of us.  It's just.  Right now he's going after the millionaires, of course.  Misappropriations of funds.  I hate the whole process.  I really do.  You know what the thing is also?  Yeah, you make a good living.  You're going to be paying a lot of taxes.  And then what happens?  There's no guarantee you're going to keep making a lot of money.  So, you know, if something happens catastrophic and you end up broke, is the government going to give you back the money you gave them? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  No, you could literally have given in millions to the government and wind up being homeless.  Right.  And go like, oh, wait, but I paid.  And they won't want to fucking hear it.  Right.  And for the people that are going to go, boo-hoo.  The fact is I got plenty of money to live the rest of my life.  You know, it's a bigger issue than that.  This is not being run properly.  No one knows how to fucking spend money in the government.  They're terrible at it. 
[00:08:30]  They waste so much fucking money.  And that's what I don't understand.  They try to get more from the people.  Yeah.  I feel like this is such basic shit.  And I understand that.  And someone will run circles around me.  But, you know, I just feel like they have plenty of money.  Yeah.  Why don't they look at themselves for once instead of us?  Yeah.  It's a shakedown.  Constantly looking at us for more money.  It's always a shakedown.  And I mean us.  I'm not talking about people that...  I'm telling you, it affects everybody. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Everyone.  I don't feel guilty wanting to keep more.  I don't make so much...  I make a good living.  But I don't make so much that I don't notice it.  I fucking notice it when they keep more.  Of course.  Yeah.  I have to think about everything I do.  Like, yeah, I get to drive at least a decent car and my place is paid and I'm fucking lucky.  But I can't just go out and do whatever the fuck I want to do.  I make a good wage.  But, I mean, you know, I'm not beyond that point where I notice it.  And you make a good living.  Yes, I do.  I make a good living.  Yes.  Yes, I do. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It's infuriating.  But, you know, I see...  I have a huge, huge, you know, extended family on Long Island.  And they're all fucking suffering.  They're all suffering.  So, you know, where's their help coming from?  Is this going to help them?  I doubt it in the end.  We'd rather have Romney give that money to them instead of another fucking millionaire.  Of course.  Like Santorum to pay his bill.  Of course.  This is not about me because, like I said, I'm fine for the rest of my life. 
[00:10:00]  I know I am.  But I have a lot of middle class people in my family and they're all fucking hurting, you know.  Yeah.  Everyone's working.  Everyone.  They get their kids working, you know, when they get old enough.  And it's not enough.  Yep.  And this dumb thing goes through with Obama.  And then you see that nothing changes again.  No, they'll still be broke.  That both parents will still be fucking working.  And the kids will be working in some cases just to pay the basic shit.  They'll still be broke with this number, this fucking debt number that's so huge. 
[00:10:30]  No one could even fucking wrap their mind around it.  Didn't they just?  It's crazy.  Didn't they just raise that too?  Of course they do.  They just casually raised it.  I do believe there's literally not enough actual money to ever pay that.  Like, you know, actual cash money, which isn't even used anymore.  So it doesn't even become money anymore.  It just becomes a thing.  Points.  Right.  It's fucking points and widgets and stuff.  You couldn't actually take and pay in cash off the debt because there isn't enough in the world to pay. 
[00:11:00]  But didn't they balance with Clinton?  The budget was balanced with Bill Clinton?  Yeah, they actually shut off the debt clock.  That's not that long ago.  Nope.  What happened?  I know Bush started that.  George Bush is a legal war man!  Is that what started it, though?  Yeah, that started the ball rolling.  You know, when you get something like 9-11 happening, you're going to have to pony up some resources.  And the wars, of course, were a huge toll. 
[00:11:30]  But, you know, Obama's had three years, over three years, what is it, to try to get some control on this spending.  And all he's done is spend more.  Record amounts of money.  All right, so he spends a lot.  Where is that money?  Has anyone's life gotten better?  Exactly.  Where is that money going?  But here's where I disagree with Anne. 
[00:12:00]  I don't think Romney fucking makes it that much better, either, in the end.  I really don't.  I really don't.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know, but I've seen what Obama does.  Yeah, I know, I understand.  I don't know, Romney could be worse.  I'm not saying that.  And that's why people, you know, jump from one side to the other, hoping the other guy's better.  Yeah.  That undecided vote.  Right.  So, enough already, though.  And they're all just liars.  Fucking Santorum, I'm telling you, we could play a montage of him just killing Romney. 
[00:12:30]  Saying he's the worst guy to put up against Obama.  Now he's going to be kissing his ass within a day or two.  Yeah.  As long as he pays them.  And I guess we're just a bunch of dummies, because we just accept it.  Like, oh, okay, now he likes them, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  We know they're scumbags.  Yeah.  But yet we're surprised when they act like scumbags.  We're surprised when they cheat on their wives.  We're surprised when they lie.  Right.  And they're all shit.  Yeah.  I saw Santorum with his little speech about suspending his campaign. 
[00:13:00]  And he's like, and I journeyed around from state to state.  And I saw the people, the people of this marvelous country.  And it's just, no one talks like that.  Shut the fuck up.  Talk like a human being.  You saw scum of the earth, too.  Shut up.  Right.  Saw assholes and shitheads.  Right.  Fucking bums.  Freeloaders.  We got a quick clip of him dropping out.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we made the decision to get into this race at our kitchen table 
[00:13:30]  against all the odds.  Very home.  Very American sounding.  Yeah.  Our, my family around the kitchen table.  Yeah.  Just like any American could do.  Any American could do that.  You sit around your kitchen table and go, you know what?  I'm going for it.  I'm going to, because it conjures up the scene of Americana.  Right.  It's like me and the family and the Indonesian boy sucking my dick under the table.  Right.  I don't care how he came up with the idea. 
[00:14:00]  It was a shitty idea.  Right.  I don't want to hear what they were eating while they hatched 9-11 either.  What a fucking, who cares what you were doing.  Humanity is happy today that this fucking jizz bag is not running.  His announcement should have been, I'm Rick Santorum and it's about time.  Right.  Fuck him.  I very, like, I don't like Mitt Romney and I don't like Newt, but I don't hate them  like I hate him.  Him, I have a vitriolic fucking hatred for.  I am completely with you, Jim Norton, who's going to be in Washington this weekend.  I wish he was dropping out because he had cancer. 
[00:14:30]  But you're talking over your plug that I'm trying to do for you.  Oh.  This, this, uh, tickets are sold out except for Thursday.  Oh, congratulations.  Tickets.  There might be 20 tickets for Friday.  No, I'm with you.  Out of all of them, I hate him the most.  He's terrible, dude.  He's terrible.  I kind of like Newt because he's just kind of, I don't know, he's kind of an asshole.  I kind of like the assholes out there, to be honest with you.  Here's a guy that's just ignoring everyone.  I know.  It's like, get out, Newt.  No.  No, I think I'm just going to hang out for a while. 
[00:15:00]  He just kind of makes it fun.  He's the guy that's just staying at the party too long.  Yeah.  You know, you're, you're, you're like, well, oh yeah, that was a good party.  Yeah.  Hey, you got any more beer?  What's on TV?  Right.  It's like, no, it's all, I want to go to bed.  Oh God.  Ah.  You're still, you're still dealing with that.  You just brought back your memory and you're still dealing with that.  Yes.  Oh my God.  The party that.  It's hilarious.  It's so obvious.  It's time to leave.  It's like, ah, well.  Leave. 
[00:15:30]  Leave.  Oh, there are times I literally just go upstairs.  Yeah.  I don't blame you like, ah, go upstairs.  Fuck it.  Oh, that's so funny.  You keep karaokeing or you keep fucking swimming.  I don't care.  There's always that point where it's so obvious, like, and it's usually everyone leaves together.  You get the stragglers that started and then everyone leaves and then you got a couple  idiots that don't get it.  There's also the, at my house, there's always the after the party kind of breaks up party,  which is cool.  There's a bunch of people and, you know, depending on how much sleep everyone's gotten the night 
[00:16:00]  before, the party continues sometimes until the sun comes up.  But, yeah, there is a point where it's like, all right, this is fucking over.  Right.  Right.  I don't mind the after party party.  That's pretty cool.  You know, that's like the hardcore people.  Fucking burger breakfasts when the sun is coming up.  Barbecue's still going.  And you're closer friends and all that, right?  Yep.  Here's more Santorum.  And we made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race for us is over 
[00:16:30]  for me, and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting.  We are going to continue to fight for those voices.  We're going to continue to fight for the Americans who stood up and gave us that air under our wings  that allowed us to accomplish things.  Oh, yuck.  You didn't.  The air.  He wanted to say wind, but even he knew it was too duly.  The wind beneath my wings. 
[00:17:00]  The air under our wings.  Oh, God.  Time for a Bette Midler moment.  Oh, this guy sucks.  Air beneath his wings.  Shut up.  Please, it's about time you get some ice building up on your leading edge.  Yeah, what about the other Americans that fucking dropped rocks on the top of your wings?  Exactly.  Shit dick.  Exactly.  Buzz off.  Buzz off.  Things that allowed us to accomplish things that no political expert would have ever expected.  There's a lot of greatness, a lot of greatness in this country, and we just need leaders 
[00:17:30]  who believe in that, who are willing to give voice to that, who are willing to raise us  up instead of trying to provide for us and do for us what we can better do for ourselves.  Pause right there, please.  Spend money properly, fuckos.  Thank you.  You already said they want to raise us up instead of doing for us what we can't.  What he's doing there is attacking what is considered liberal thinking, which is social entitlement  programs and all that stuff, instead of doing for us.  And then this motherfucker is asking Romney for money. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  You cock.  Right.  What a piece of shit.  Right.  Why am I yelling?  Oh, no, you should be.  But just that, that's how fucking fraudulent these guys are.  Yeah, the whole thing's phony.  I love that the anti-abortion guy has aborted his campaign.  Oh.  How about you take it to the end, dummy?  Yeah, right.  Carry that campaign full term, shithead, and then live with it. 
[00:18:30]  You fucking asshole.  You force everybody else to have, you know, kids after they're raped and shit.  That's funny.  Guess what?  Guess what?  Yeah.  You should be forced to go to the end, spending your own fucking money, too.  You know what?  He wants people to fucking have to keep their babies.  Right.  He should be forced to keep this and spend his, oh, fuck, you're right.  Now you gotta spend, yeah, it's gonna cost you some money and time and effort.  This guy is a jizz bag, and it says a lot about our country that a guy, you know, like  this, got this close to the presidency. 
[00:19:00]  That's fucking scary, man.  It's a gift from God, Rick.  Right.  This campaign was a gift from God.  How can you throw it back?  A magical gift.  What a fucking fraud.  He is a fraud.  And now he basically wants government assistance to fucking get him out of his debt.  Oh, what a cocksucker.  Technically, it's not, you know.  Right.  You know what I'm saying.  It's kind of similar.  He's got his hat in his hand and his fucking dignity.  He's standing on his dignity.  Right, yeah.  Right.  And it's actually a bribe. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Here you go.  I'll pay off your debt.  Just say that you back me, regardless of what your real ideology is, which is all bullshit.  Yeah.  It's whatever way the wind blows.  Yeah.  Then in the end, you don't even know what these guys stand for.  They're all phonies, you know.  We can better do for ourselves.  Yeah.  That's the message that came to me.  And it's one that I feel very, very good about continuing to talk to Americans about.  You know, I walked out after the Iowa caucus victory and said, game on. 
[00:20:00]  I know a lot of folks are going to write.  Game on.  Maybe it was even at the White House.  Game over.  But this game is a long, long, long way from over.  Nah, it's over.  No, it's over.  It's over, brother.  It's over.  Ask the black pizza guy.  It's over, brother.  It's not over, so why are you fucking asking for funds?  Yeah.  For help.  Stop using fucking dumb terms.  Stop using sports terms.  The game's over.  The game's just begun.  Game on.  Game on.  You think he said that in Iowa?  After Iowa, he's like, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, guys.  Game on.  He did say it.  Oh, God.  It's fucking disgusting.  That's how it works with a quarterback.  That's what happens.  In the first quarter, the quarterback drops out, and then he says, this game's the long  way from over.  Shut up.  Go home.  Basically, he's saying he'll still be in the political limelight.  No, that's not.  Game over.  Game over.  Look at all the other candidates over the years.  I guarantee you can't mention 10 of them right now.  Game over, man.  They go away.  Yes, they do.  Yeah.  They fade the fuck away.  Thank God, too. 
[00:21:00]  So, Santorum, that was great news for everybody, man.  Twitter fucking exploded.  People were really happy in general.  Yeah, I'd like to see some recent polling now that's going to come up since he dropped  out and see where his support is being thrown about.  I don't think it's going to Obama.  Obama.  No.  Of course not.  All to Romney.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Romney gets just about all that.  Newt picks off a few, probably.  Now, Romney could probably start going more to the center. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  That's what's going to happen, right?  And not start screaming about conservativism and that religious right horse shit.  Because he's more of a moderate guy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's had to...  You know, when you're trying to combat Santorum, you've got to sound like you're far right,  you know?  Right.  He had to sort of fake it.  Yeah.  But now he'll move...  More phoniness.  He'll move, you know, toward what he really believes now.  Yeah.  Or more.  That was a good fucking point, man. 
[00:22:00]  That abortion.  Yeah.  That was a good...  Well...  Oh, man.  Fucking cocksucker he is.  He's a guy that forces, you know, wants to force women to have babies after they've been  raped and shit.  That's a tough spot to be put in.  And he wants to make that decision for them.  That's unbelievable, that whole thing.  You know, and rape.  But, yeah, well, have that fucking constant reminder of the worst thing that ever happened  to you, the ladies.  Walking around.  Oh, that's right.  It's a rape baby. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  So, I think the second headline today is Ozzie Gillen.  You know, you guys made a lot of good points on Twitter, I guess, but...  Because I always scream freedom of speech when a guy, you know, speaks his mind.  I think in America, we want people to speak their minds, right?  Yes.  That's an old Manson fucking video.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen the new ones.  I'm guessing that's 97.  If that's a parole hearing, he's not been on one since 97.  We're looking at Charlie Manson, who's up for parole.  I don't think we're going to see that.  Oh, they're showing some real old video. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, he's totally gray right now.  Home video of the Bin Ladens.  Wow.  Oh.  That might be new.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  It's the Bin Ladens.  He's dancing with a severed head.  His wife is not dancing because it's punishable by stoning.  She's just standing there.  She stands there stiff.  Looking at a stain on the wall.  Very frightened.  What a fun house that was. 
[00:23:30]  Six foot eight with a turban.  Creep.  Oh, there's Charlie.  That's what he looks like now?  That's the new, uh, well, it's 2011.  That's about a year old.  He doesn't look that bad in 2011.  He's all white haired.  How the fuck does he get to keep all his hair like that, man?  I don't know, right?  That's just not fair.  I saw a guy yesterday on the news.  Yeah.  Apparently Manson's son.  It was some guy's, uh, it looked to be in his 40s, I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Uh, and his mom remembered the woman, remembered, you know, told him about, uh, times that they 
[00:24:00]  hung out together and told him stuff that only, you know, the mother and him would really  know.  And they put the pictures next to each other.  It's absolutely Charles Manson's son.  Is the guy.  That's the guy.  Is the guy cool?  That's the guy right there.  What does that guy do for a living?  I don't know, but he looks a little, he, he comes off a little weird when he talks.  He looks like he could go into the family business.  Yeah.  Doesn't he?  Take over the old family business.  Oh my God.  Manson and sons. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  Yeah.  He looks like him.  What does he do for a living?  Do we know?  Where does he live?  I don't know.  That's gotta be weird.  Yeah.  Charlie just wake up and realize you're Charlie Manson's son.  And he was rambling about something too.  It was weird.  He had the same cadence and everything.  Really?  Yeah.  When did he find out?  Uh, recently.  Yeah.  He asked his mom and, uh, his mom said, well, it's like this.  Charles Manson.  Your, your, your dad is Charles Manson.  If you know what he does for a living, Sam, let us know. 
[00:25:00]  Right?  So what do you guys think of the Ozzie Gillen?  Because I scream and yell.  Jimmy loves him.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  I think you want, I think you want people speaking honestly in this, in, in this country.  Yes, you do.  But there's major consequences if you do so.  And a lot of you, I'll, I'll admit, you made, uh, some good points on Twitter because  you're saying what he said is affecting the business of the Miami Marlins.  And so, so, uh, the Miami Marlins have every right to suspend him.  My tweet said the, uh, major league baseball, but obviously the Marlins suspended him for 
[00:25:30]  five days.  And I don't necessarily disagree with that, but it's frustrating to me that, you know,  these companies have so much power when it comes to free speech.  I, I hate that they suspended, and I, I read the same points, people saying that stuff.  Yeah, I don't buy it.  But the points aren't wrong.  Right.  But what they're saying, well, it's a business, so technically, so, but what he was saying  was not, if, if he says he loves Castro, that's literally like saying, I'm a Democrat.  Right. 
[00:26:00]  Or it's an, maybe it's a popular or unpopular opinion, but if he would have said, instead  of, I love Castro, what if Ozzie Guillen had said, you know what?  I love Bill Clinton.  Yeah.  And they fucking got offended at that, and we fired him for that.  Yeah.  Right.  Anyone on Twitter that was saying that, I, what, it's too dangerous an area, and people  like, what, if, so if he works for your business, uh, and he says, I hate blacks, or I like  rape, you think that's okay?  And it's like, can you not see the difference?  Yeah.  Like, in an honest discussion, can you not see the difference between saying, I like this 
[00:26:30]  guy.  Right.  But then again, if he comes out and he says, hey, I love Hitler, they're going to suspend  him for that.  So where's the line?  Man, I guess you got to use common sense.  I don't know.  Did you hear the exact quote?  It wasn't that bad.  No, it wasn't bad.  And most of the media will never say this to you, that it wasn't that bad.  He doesn't agree with, uh, Castro's ideology.  He just is pretty amazed that the guy's been able to stay in power as long as he has.  Yeah.  And that people continue to worship him.  He didn't, he didn't say, I love Castro, meaning I love, you know, him and his ideas. 
[00:27:00]  What the Marlins have just done, or what business does is they say that if you come out, like,  what if you, okay, let's just say you're for a gay marriage or you're anti-gay marriage and  somebody asks you publicly and you say, yeah, I'm against that.  But all of a sudden it starts to hurt business, so they should suspend you.  Uh, what if you say, uh, I'm for interracial marriage, I'm against interracial marriage.  Every fucking opinion you give about a, about a public figure is going to cause somebody  to be unhappy. 
[00:27:30]  But those people, and I'm sure they're tweeting already, would go, oh, that would never happen,  Jimmy.  Uh, I don't like that corporations have any say in your freedom of speech.  They do though.  It's so, and there was a time, it's a loophole almost where people go, well, it's the corporations  not the government.  Yeah.  You're, but it's like, no, they, they, they're using some kind of mafia tactic again to, uh,  to keep you from saying, I'll say again, they're not wrong by saying that, but you shouldn't  just casually say it like you do because it will affect you eventually. 
[00:28:00]  We, we come from a time not too long ago where you didn't have to deal with corporate bullshit.  You dealt with the government when it came to free speech.  Right.  I, I, I, most of my, my career, I never thought a company could get me fired, meaning, meaning  a sponsor, I guess I should say.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, as long as you follow the company's rules, but now we all have that clause, the  defamation clause in our contracts.  We do.  And most people that have a, have kind of a white collar type job where if you say the wrong 
[00:28:30]  thing at work, they can fire you now.  That, that wasn't the case when we were coming up.  You just can't give an opinion publicly anymore.  No.  And anybody, and the guys that are saying that it's like, I think, uh, what the South  Park guys say when they're talking about making fun of something, it's either all okay or  none of it is.  Yes.  And that's a brilliant quote and it's the way free speech should be.  You have to be able to express opinions that are going to upset people.  I understand he, he represents the Marlins, but every one of us has a job.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  So any one of us could be seen as hurting the business by offering an opinion that is  agreed with or disagreed with.  And does it really affect the business in the end?  No.  What, what affects, what affects, uh, the business in baseball is losses.  Yeah.  If, if the Miami Marlins went on just this ridiculous winning streak, guess what?  They don't give a fuck what Ozzie said.  Yeah, what he's saying.  That's a fact.  I'm sorry.  And they're trying to appease all the Cubans in Miami, um, because they're in an outrage  about it.  But how about this?  If they don't want to go to a baseball game because of what the manager believes, fuck 
[00:29:30]  them and fuck him.  Right.  I don't care what my coaches or managers believe politically.  I don't care.  Obviously it's a very sensitive, uh, issue down there in Florida, especially.  Well, no one goes to the games anyway.  Oh, I know.  What, what was Gillen's exact quote about Castro?  Castro because people don't even know the exact quote anymore because they just hear  a little, a little, uh, you know, sound clip on the news.  He said something about, um, he loves, he respects him that he has stayed in power for  so long. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Um, but then he explained something about, I don't, I don't agree with his ideology.  He does say that in there.  Hmm.  Yeah.  But I don't know if that's in the original quote or in the apology.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Cause, cause they kind of wiped out the original shit, but this is the same as Helen Thomas  being fired for saying that she thinks Israel should be out of Palestine.  Yeah.  This is the same for Miss America being asked her opinion on gay marriage and getting shit  when she answered it.  Yeah.  Everyone's finding reasons why it's okay.  Even these guys on Twitter.  Well, here's the company. 
[00:30:30]  It's like you dumb motherfuckers.  You've turned into the company fucking mouthpieces.  Right.  You dummies.  You just, you idiots that are saying this are the same ones that if you put a flag up in  your cubicle, this is the same mentality that tells you to take that flag down because  it's going to upset somebody and if it upsets somebody, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's got to go and you'll be mad, but then you can't identify that this is the same fucking  thing.  It's the same fucking thing.  Right.  You can't have it both ways.  I want the right to express my opinions. 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  Look, I don't have any problem with Castro, but a lot of people hate his guts.  Fair enough.  Right.  But where is the, I guess you have to say, where's the line?  Like if he came out and said, I really respect Hitler.  Yeah.  That would be something you're going, well, that's, that's a really stupid.  thing to say publicly, or if he came out and said, I like child rape, but I mean, so what  is the line?  There has to be some kind of a line.  What is it?  Who makes it?  A lot of people saying what he said about Castro is really stupid.  Yeah.  They are saying that.  I want the original quote though, man, because he does explain a little further than what 
[00:31:30]  the news is giving you right now.  What he meant by that.  Yeah.  But now they just say, oh, he's praising Castro in this, in this article.  Well, we'll read the article.  Yeah.  He did, he did, he did explain further.  What do you mean by that?  The whole thing.  And by the way, I love these people in fucking Miami who want him to have his job removed.  Hey, fuck you guys too.  You came from Cuba or you hate Castro because it's a repressive regime and then he says something 
[00:32:00]  you don't like and you want him fired.  Yeah.  How about, how about you fucking stop doing in a much milder way what you hate that Castro  does?  Right.  How about you allow Ozzie Guillen to have his unpopular fucking opinion?  Right.  And continue to have his livelihood.  Yeah.  Because you don't have freedom of speech in Cuba.  No.  That's what you hate about Castro.  Right.  I don't think you'd be able to say something like that in Cuba.  Oh, you can't.  And we don't want that shit to happen in America.  They hate him because he's repressive and he's, I guess, a murderer of Castro.  Right.  Then Guillen says something they don't like and they want him fired.  It's all selfish. 
[00:32:30]  Freedom of speech has become this fucking selfish way to get our own opinions across and we  don't give a fuck about the rights of someone else to say it.  You have the right to be offended.  Yes.  You have the right to offend.  And the right to offend.  You have the right to offend.  Yes.  Yes.  So I guess some, you know, a bunch of you are right that the employer has every right  to do what they did, but you should be yelling and screaming that, look, but this guy should  be able to say this stuff.  So you want people speaking honestly, especially on TV. 
[00:33:00]  I hate the fact the employer does this.  I know.  And nobody will fight.  By the way, this is why the employer does this, because the other fucking, most of the  people that don't care would never go, hey, this guy's free speech is being fucked with.  Right.  He said something I don't like, but he, he's kind of the same as I am.  He should have the right.  We never fucking defended.  Yeah.  It's just easy to say, yeah, the employer has the right to do what they did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So all you dummies out there remember it.  Yeah, I guess technically they do.  You're right.  Technically they do.  Sure.  But I see it as a much bigger issue.  Yep.  All you dummies out there, remember you said that when you fucking, when you're, when you 
[00:33:30]  get fired or when you get in trouble for saying something that you should not get in trouble  for.  When you get in trouble for expressing a political opinion.  Yeah.  Or, or, or some type of, of an honest opinion on a social issue, which isn't popular by  anybody can take anything and say, well, it's going to cause backlash.  So it gives a fuck if a bunch of, uh, shitty fans don't want to go to a game.  Half of them probably wouldn't go to games anyway.  Uh, you're probably right.  They probably can't afford it.  Soccer.  They like soccer.  Just in general, you can't afford baseball. 
[00:34:00]  I'm not saying they can't afford baseball.  Yes.  Because now that'll be twisted.  It's an expensive ticket to go to the ballpark.  It certainly is.  Uh, what a, yeah.  Good job.  Yeah.  It's fucking ridiculous though.  And I know people will, uh, I am happy that the Marlins didn't fire the guy though.  I know, but they shouldn't have, they should have said, look, we don't agree with his opinion.  Uh, but his job is to coach a baseball.  And then, but then people will say on Twitter, well, his job is to coach. 
[00:34:30]  So wait, so fair enough.  And if he had said that in a game, like if he had gotten onto the last, you're right.  I would agree with you.  But what, because he's a coach, he doesn't have the right to express his opinions as a citizen when he's interviewed?  That's just a person, right.  What, what's the actual quote?  Um, the closest that I could get to it was, time quoted him saying he loved and respected Castro because, quote,  quote, a lot of people have wanted to kill him for the last 60 years, but that mother expletive is still there.  That motherfucker. 
[00:35:00]  No, he said mother expletive.  Yeah.  He likes the word expletive.  Oh, nice.  And that was it?  That was, yeah.  I think he said something about, I don't agree with his, you know, politics.  A lot of people are saying that they're having trouble finding the full quote.  There are several articles.  I saw that somewhere.  I thought he said that in the apology.  Maybe you're right there.  Maybe it was in the apology?  I don't know.  All right.  See, this is how it gets all confusing.  I swear I saw that.  That's why you got to say, he can say what he wants.  Right.  He should only be fired if he's a bad coach. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  He's doing his job.  Yeah.  That isn't that bad of a quote.  Please.  And even if you do say something like, I love Hitler, I mean, or whatever it is, it's such  a dumb quote, a dumb thing to say.  But you know what?  I guess you got to have the right to say it.  I mean, you have to.  Companies having the right.  Like, I think when the country was formed, there wasn't big corporations firing people  for saying things publicly.  It wasn't done.  So freedom of speech was simply government repression. 
[00:36:00]  And people now are like, well, if it's not the government doing it, it's not a free speech  issue.  It is.  But if you don't have the right to express yourself and say what you want to say.  You can't have this looming thing of being fired and losing your livelihood over your  head that's keeping you from expressing your opinions.  It's just as bad as the government doing it.  Because the spirit of free speech is that you can express yourself freely.  And that does matter.  It's like, remember, separate but equal.  And I've used this before.  But they say the mindset of the guys who wrote the Constitution counts. 
[00:36:30]  What their intent was.  Because they couldn't foresee the future.  So what their intent was when they wrote it does mean something.  Right.  So the fact is, they didn't mean for the government only, and your boss should be able to fire  you for saying whatever you want.  There's consequences for what you say.  I do understand that.  Yes.  You can't just say something and not expect to get something back for what you say because  there's freedom of speech.  No.  There's consequences for what you say.  There shouldn't be consequences just for the fact that you're saying something.  And that's what's happening here. 
[00:37:00]  They're not, they're being, he's being punished for merely speaking his point of view.  Right.  It's not the consequence of what he said.  The consequence of what he said, all right, a Cuban group can say, Castro's a fucking killer.  How could you say this?  And then it opens up a dialogue between him and these people.  That's the consequence for saying what you said, but not the consequence of just saying  something.  That's, there's a big difference there.  I don't know if I'm really putting it across well enough here, but that's what people are 
[00:37:30]  usually fucked with in corporations is just that you said it, not even what really, the  bulk of what you said.  Because if you said, I love Saddam Hussein five years ago, people go, oh my God, you're  fired.  If you said that in 1990 or 1988 or 1985, perfectly acceptable.  He is fighting those Iranians.  Very good.  It just keeps, continues to change what's allowed and what's not.  That's not the intent of free speech.  I don't believe that's what the constitution has had in mind when they drafted it. 
[00:38:00]  Just like when it was separate but equal, they didn't have in mind that, uh, that blacks  would get a separate but equal.  There was a difference.  Uh, that's where it came out.  Uh, it was in separate but equal, I think Brown versus board of education.  I don't remember.  I can't quote it.  A lawyer obviously could, but they were saying that the mindset matters.  And I don't believe that when they wrote the constitution, they wanted you to be in  fear of, like Anne said, the looming fucking firing for any opinion you expressed. 
[00:38:30]  Because it will happen, they're, they're wheeling away at it so much, it will happen that a  guy will come out and say, you know what, I, I disagree with, uh, Santorum on abortion  or I disagree with Clinton's fucking foreign policy that he had and, and they'll say they  can fire you because technically a lot of our clientele is Republican and we don't like  you or Democrat.  And not even, but they don't even have to get on you about what you said.  They could say, you know what?  Your job is to do this. 
[00:39:00]  Um, we don't like any, any political speech or any, you know, we, we, we, we, we don't  like, uh, politics being discussed in our environment, regardless if you say, yeah, I'm way right  or I'm way left or whatever.  Like they don't care about that.  It's just the fact that you're saying it.  And I think that's what they fucked him on.  They're like, Hey, this isn't your platform to fucking talk about, uh, uh, Castro or any  other leader.  And meanwhile, all these companies donate money to fucking politicians.  They all give money to one side or the other. 
[00:39:30]  So the corporation expresses their opinion.  Yeah.  They just do it quietly and sneaky and through paying people for lobbying with their pocket  books, their purse strings.  So they basically want that right.  And they want to be able to do that and, and, and push for what they want done.  Right.  But don't you say it and make us look bad.  It's a fucking lie.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  Uh, they're pushing the same thing on him that he fled his country for in the first place.  That's sort of what I think.  Yep.  But corporations, they have a lot of fucking power and no one pushes back. 
[00:40:00]  No one pushes.  No one.  Like if all those other fans said, well, you fucked to the guys.  If the people were real Americans and had like a real American value and said, I'm not  going to games.  You guys are repressing this guy's speech and I don't like what he said.  Yeah.  It should go the other way too.  No, but it doesn't.  And that's why they do it.  And I think that's the point that needs to be made.  Yeah.  Everyone has to push back.  Now look, the guy should be able to say what he fucking said.  The apathetic people of this country that just go, Oh, well, Oh, well, Oh, well, Oh, 
[00:40:30]  well, when they're saying we don't hire this guy for his opinion, we hire him to coach.  Well, then just judge him on his coaching.  Yeah.  Then don't, then don't get involved when he says something.  What you're going to get is no one speaking their mind.  No one.  No one, uh, speaking honestly, it's already happened all or all or happening all around  us.  Obviously, you know, in our dumb business, regular radio, no one's speaking their mind or mind  or, uh, you know, speaking honestly.  Hell no.  Except for maybe some of the political talk shows.  Sure. 
[00:41:00]  But it used to be across the board.  Guys on radio would give their opinion on stuff.  Now they're told, no, yeah, I just don't do that.  God, no, don't do that.  Oh, you represent this.  No, I was supposed to represent as a broadcasting, you know, different ideas and opinions and  stuff.  But no, now they're like, well, you know, our sponsor.  There was a time guys would get on the radio and say just the most outrageous shit to get  the phones going and get it, uh, get, and they would get an open debate on stuff.  But then you got a clip like from Rod Serling from years ago in the fifties talking about 
[00:41:30]  that, uh, show, um, judgment at Nuremberg where they, they were sponsored by a company  that made, uh, gas stoves.  That was part of one of the things they sold and they did not want the word gas chamber  put in, in the judgment, uh, Nuremberg because people would make that.  Connection between the ovens and gas and the gas that was used to, to power the, the 
[00:42:00]  oven to fuel the oven is like, what?  So he was even getting shit.  Serling was talking about that in 59.  It's, it's amazing.  The fact that, um, he, he wrote something that had a, it was a racial thing between black  and white and they didn't want that.  He had to change the race of the people.  To a foreigner or something, right?  Yeah.  Just some ambiguous foreigner or something.  It, it's, uh, so they were dealing with it back then.  Corporations.  He said corporations were a big part of what he wrote.  Right.  And then, and then he talks about a certain type of censorship where you censor yourself 
[00:42:30]  because you know something's not going to make it through.  Right.  So you're not artistically able to even go that next step and do exactly what you want  to do because you're already thinking, well, I'm going to get fucking, you know, beat up  for that one.  Do you remember in the seventies or whatever, or maybe they still do it where they would,  uh, they would say things like, uh, the net didn't, what are the opinions expressed are  not necessarily that.  Okay.  I don't mind.  That's fair.  Yeah.  We're putting you on our air, but your opinions are not necessarily ours. 
[00:43:00]  Why don't people just have that attitude?  Like your opinions are not necessarily ours.  You know, they only put it on now that, that bit before an infomercial about fucking, you  know, a vegetable chopper.  The opinions expressed in this commercial are not necessarily those with the station.  It's like, really?  There's some real dangerous stuff going on with a fucking Bowflex.  But, uh, yeah, there used to be those opinions that they, they'd have other people, uh, rebuttals.  The rebuttal, um, to usually the station manager that would come on and give his little 
[00:43:30]  opinion on something.  I remember that.  And then they'd have the rebuttal and it was just some John Q public guy that would  come up and, and talk his, uh, shit.  Ryan's got a great question that we're kind of trying to answer here.  Go ahead, uh, Ryan.  Yeah.  I just don't understand what the line is when it comes to expressing your opinion, whether  you're asked or you just.  That's always been, but that's always been the problem because, and that's why it's always,  um, ballied about in courts because we really don't know where the line is.  First amendment is constantly being challenged. 
[00:44:00]  Um, in, in courts and you don't really, there isn't a definite line.  That's part of the beauty of it too, is that you can't be locked in, um, and, and told that  you can't say something.  Uh, it's, it's very fluid.  Yeah.  We don't have an answer to your question, Ryan.  That's what we're trying to figure out today.  I personally, hold on.  I personally think just with this incident, uh, with Ozzie that he should have been able  to fucking express his opinion on Fidel Castro and it, and it shouldn't have affected him 
[00:44:30]  coaching the Marlins.  So here's, sorry to cut you off, but here's like a better question.  What if they asked him like, Hey Ozzie, where were you on nine 11?  And what were your thoughts about that?  And he goes, well, honestly, I don't really have a big problem with nine 11.  And I think, uh, you know, we, a lot, we brought a lot of it on ourselves and we got what we  deserve.  I would, should the consequence be the same with, or should he just be allowed to say  whatever he wants?  I feel like if that's how he felt about nine 11, then he should be able to fucking express  that opinion.  I hate that opinion, but he should have the right to say that. 
[00:45:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Ron Paul can answer very easily.  Ron Paul had an opinion that maybe was not as extreme as what you just said, but Ron Paul  was talking and I liked Ron Paul cause he didn't back off on, even though I didn't agree  with him.  He said something about, or I actually did kind of agree with him.  He was saying something about blowback.  We have to understand that with our foreign policy, there is blowback.  Um, meaning that I don't think that means that we are necessarily, we brought it on  ourselves, but there is a reaction to every action. 
[00:45:30]  So you have to judge, I think if that action is worth it.  And I'm not paraphrasing Ron Paul.  I'm always saying he said blowback.  So Ron Paul said something about blowback and a lot of people have expressed that opinion  that it's our foreign policy.  That's an opinion.  Some people have, that's an opinion.  Some people disagree with.  So to answer your question, I wouldn't necessarily like he said that, but it's a fair opinion to  have.  Right.  But he should, so in other words, he should have the right to, across the board, say anything  he wants in any, in regard to any topic.  Sure.  At all.  I think you have to, I'll tell you why. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  What if it comes out that he is, uh, he's married, like I keep using the interracial or  gay marriage, but that's just the hot topic is the gay marriage.  What if it turns out that Ozzy, Ozzy Guillen is a homosexual?  What if it comes out that he's married to a white woman or he is married to a Jewish woman?  That could be considered a controversial issue.  It's you, you can't, it's gotta just be allowed.  Yeah, it really does.  It's gotta be.  Well, that goes back to, that goes back to where's the line?  Like if you go, okay, he's married to a Jewish woman. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Well, a lot of people are married to an interracialist.  It's a hot topic, sure, but it's not as controversial as I love Castro and I have everyone to construe  what he said.  But those are the words, or I love 9-11 or I love child porn.  Like, again, where is the line?  Should he just be able to say anything he wants?  We don't know, but I think what, what is happening is the line is being pulled, pulled back.  You know, right now, you know, it's okay to say you're married to a Jewish woman.  Maybe that's not going to be okay in another fucking decade or something. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what's not going to be okay in another 10 years from now.  That's the problem.  It feels like the line is literally being pulled back.  We pushed it way out there, and now it's coming all the way back.  But you're just a victim of the time that you're in.  Like in the 40s, if he said, yeah, I got no problem with Japanese, that would have been a huge problem.  Right.  So you're really just a victim of the time period that you're in and what you say at that point.  That's a good point.  But then you have to acknowledge and then at least say that free speech is arbitrary, 
[00:47:30]  and it changes and it's transient what's offensive, so it's not real free speech.  No, it is free speech, Jim, because he has the right to say it without getting shot,  like if he was in some other oppressive country.  But the point is what Anthony was saying before is you're going to have consequences for your actions.  And, Ant, I know what you were saying.  Like if he says, I love Castro, and you expect some angry Cuban punch in the mouth.  Right.  It's Castro.  Yeah.  It's people that hate Castro, that that's what his â€“ that's the shit he should get shit for from those people 
[00:48:00]  and then, you know, discuss it like that.  But weren't those the consequences, though?  Didn't he meet those consequences?  No.  We have seen the consequences are you lose your job.  Because him liking or not liking Castro, how does that affect baseball?  How does that affect his coaching ability?  So for them to suspend him, that consequence for his speaking isn't the consequence of what he said.  It's the consequence that he said anything.  There's a big difference between if I said it and if he said it. 
[00:48:30]  Like he's a figurehead.  He's a â€“  Okay, so your free speech is different than his.  Okay, just say that then.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm saying he's on a different platform than I am.  So you agree that he should have been suspended for what he said?  No, I don't give a fuck what he said.  No, I don't think so.  Okay.  I mean, but I'm a big guy about like it depends on what he's saying.  If he said, yeah, I got no problem with kids getting raped, all right, that's a huge deal.  But if he goes, I love Castro, even if he said he loved Castro, I don't give a fuck.  He said that motherfucker, and I don't think he said that â€“ 
[00:49:00]  like we'll say that motherfucker on this radio show.  And believe it or not, it's in a weird, loving way.  I don't think Ozzie Gillen is saying that motherfucker in that way we use it sometimes on this show.  So that was â€“ I thought that was strong language, you know, showing everyone what he really thought of the guy.  He's more amazed, I think, that Castro has been in â€“ you know, has been ruling Cuba for as long as he has.  And you just gave the corporate line when you called in, sir.  Like you basically are saying that like, hey, you're a victim of the time you live in. 
[00:49:30]  But look at how subtle this type of stuff is because we never think that we should be penalized for what we say.  Like you said, Ozzie â€“ you mentioned Ozzie, well, he's on a different platform than I am.  You find these reasons, and I guess we all do it, to separate ourselves and to make our situation different from the person who's getting in trouble.  And we find reasons why, well, I can see why he got shit, but here's why I wouldn't or here's why I shouldn't.  And it's always a self-serving thing, and I think that's why we have to just look at it like, hey, you're going to sometimes bother people with what you say. 
[00:50:00]  We have to understand that.  I don't â€“ I'm not saying I agree with what happened to him, but I'm saying I can see where the punishment came into play.  Like if you're somebody of influence or, you know, celebrity or whatever, maybe you tend to watch your mouth a little more than if you're just the average Joe.  You know what I mean?  I don't agree with it, by the way.  I'm saying that.  I don't want anyone watching what they say because at this point we don't even know what these politicians really fucking stand for because they're being so careful because if they say the wrong thing, oh, we're going to piss off this part of our base. 
[00:50:30]  Or if we say this, oh, boy, we're going to lose the blacks or whatever.  I want people to speak honestly, especially in the media, especially in magazine articles if you're asked your opinion.  What the hell?  We're training each other to be liars.  We are just training each other that if you say the wrong thing, you're going to suffer for it. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, free speech.  You're not going to jail, but you're going to get fired.  You're going to have some type of a financial detriment.  You're going to be punished for an opinion you express that some people don't like.  And how anybody cannot see that as an absolute free speech issue is beyond me.  How many people have lined up with their fucking assholes open and are willing to be fucked by their companies?  Because you're saying the average Joe.  But, dude, the average Joe is you can't put a flag in your cubicle. 
[00:51:30]  Okay, that's a good point, actually.  Okay, so you were just leading me into my next question.  And this is right up Antali.  Let's say I'm at work and I decide, you know what, I want to throw up the Nazi flag.  I kind of like what they were into.  I'm a World War II buff, but I just want to throw it up there because it's a cool collector's piece.  Is that okay?  It might be considered inciting.  Yeah, but I would also...  Yeah.  I would say the question you raise is a good question because it's like how far does it go? 
[00:52:00]  Right.  And we don't know.  But that's always been the problem, even with things like pornography.  Yes.  Like, what did that judge say?  I don't know what pornography is, but I can't define it, but I know when I see it.  It's kind of a weird thing, freedom of speech.  You don't know where the line is.  I think it's got to be a case-by-case basis.  I don't know.  The Nazi flag is a good question, though, because it technically, hey, you should be able to express that opinion.  But I do understand.  Maybe, I guess the point could be, but again, this point could be shot down easily. 
[00:52:30]  You have to look at, can a reasonable person see this as being, I don't know.  And the Nazi thing has always been in its own category.  I know.  That's always the extreme.  It makes it so easy, and then it kind of fucks up the discussion when you bring up the whole Nazi thing.  But that has always been in its own category.  What's the second thing after Nazi that you could go with, as an example?  I couldn't even tell you.  The Jews!  But what would be the second one? 
[00:53:00]  A joke about slavery.  Right, right.  The Dixie flag is a popular one now, which is anything that brings up certain images.  Because technically, with the Nazi thing, you could go, no, I like it for what it meant before.  You know.  Right.  It's a very tough...  But no one's going to listen to you.  Yeah, the Confederate flag is still being flown in some places in the South, and people get a lot of shit for that.  And meanwhile, there are plenty of people who see their southern roots and people that were relatives, descendants of Confederate soldiers, 
[00:53:30]  and they just see it as paying respects to them.  But, you know, people don't see it that way.  A Nazi flag, we all see.  There's nobody that would hang that.  I think, I guess, and again, this is my opinion.  Unless you're testing free speech.  If you go into your workplace and hang up a Nazi flag, if you were really that person, you probably wouldn't have gotten hired in the first place.  But I also think, and again, I guess this is where it becomes a really weird thing. 
[00:54:00]  We understand the difference in most cases between hanging a Nazi flag and hanging an American flag, or hanging any other country's flag.  Hanging a Japanese flag, or a flag of Jordan, or whatever flag you want to hang.  Just like we understand the difference between Ozzy Guillen saying, I love Castro, I respect the fact that he stayed in power,  and a guy going out and saying, I think baby rape is acceptable.  Like, there are opinions you give which, again, could I prove this in court?  No.  But I think there are opinions that people can hear and understand that that's a real opinion, 
[00:54:30]  and it's an expression of yourself, and I am just trying to be a piece of shit.  But again, I know that's not a real answer.  Yeah, it's not, because what's acceptable to one person isn't to the other.  I know.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but I don't have an answer for it, but I still think that Guillen did nothing wrong.  He expressed an opinion.  I think my answer is simple.  I just want more people to speak up about this issue in general,  and not just say, ah, the company has every right to do what they did. 
[00:55:00]  You know, I think it's much deeper than that, and I wish people would kind of express that more.  Ryan, let me let you go, because a lot of people want in on this, okay?  All right, bro.  I would love to hear a lawyer's opinion on that, because that's a good question.  Like, because I remember when I was in, oh, I remember the answer I got.  When I was in a junior in high school, we had a law class,  and I remember asking the teacher, what about the rights, and I remember what his answer was, 
[00:55:30]  something about, what if you have a license plate, personalized license plates are legal,  and what if your last name was legitimately K-U-N-T?  I asked him that.  I said, you have the same right as the next person to put that,  but technically it's offensive, so where's that?  His answer was something along the lines of, in that case,  Shut up, Jim.  Yeah, put this back in your mouth, are you failing?  It was something about the rights of the public to not be violated with that word, or overall. 
[00:56:00]  I don't remember what his answer was, but I asked that in a junior in high school.  And that's a very good question, because when I was caddy, and I'm going to say it again,  there was a couple, Anita and Richard Kuntz, K-U-N-T-Z.  Anita Kuntz.  I swear to you.  And Dick Kuntz.  Technically their name was Kuntz, but you fucked it up all the time.  Yeah.  All the time you would call him Mr. or Mrs. Kuntz.  We got Dan in Westchester who wants in on this topic. 
[00:56:30]  Dan, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mr.  What I was going to say, I'm not wanting to take the side of the corporation necessarily,  but there are two points that I would make.  One is, what if he said, instead of I love Castro, that the owners are idiots, okay?  And the reason we're in last place is because they're morons.  So he's hurting the corporation there. 
[00:57:00]  Now, if you say that, well, maybe there's a difference between saying that and saying,  I love Castro.  Think about the fact that this is not the Milwaukee Brewers.  This is the Miami Marlins, where they've got a very large Cuban population.  The manager saying something like that might lower their attendance.  They might be, he might be hurting their bottom line.  So a corporation has to have the ability to protect themselves by saying, you can't say  that because it's going to hurt us. 
[00:57:30]  I understand.  Right.  And what you're making is a real point, and I know that's a real point.  And again, I know the corporation, their argument would be, look, have your opinions in your  personal life, but when you speak publicly, and I'm sure it's in the contract, when you  speak publicly, you are representing us.  And when you represent us, if you don't represent us in a manner that we deem appropriate, we  have the right to terminate you.  And I understand that a corporation does have to retain that right, because if you do go 
[00:58:00]  out and say something bizarre and crazy that hurts them a bit, the point I'm making is  it shouldn't be like that.  We as a society should not find that acceptable.  We as a society should find the unpopular opinion more acceptable.  Like, we shouldn't want to protest a corporation because a guy says something that's unpopular.  It's a problem with all of us that we accept that.  What's wrong with that part of diversity?  Isn't that diversity?  Everyone's always crowing about diversity. 
[00:58:30]  Diversity doesn't just mean fill a room up with people of different colors.  It means different opinions and ideas, and it opens them up for discussion.  But people don't like that part of diversity, because it means you're not agreeing with me.  And I wonder how much the bottom line would be affected in the end.  I really do.  I wonder if it's a real thing, or if the bottom line would be affected because they're just  not winning baseball games.  If they win, people will go.  If they win, they wouldn't give a fuck what Ozzy said in the end. 
[00:59:00]  They just wouldn't.  Dude, Billy Martin, look what Billy Martin did.  He always got fired for arguing with Steinbrenner, and they'd be hired back.  Him and fucking, they had a fist fight in the fucking, like him and Reggie, or him and  Thurman Munson had like a fist fight in the dugout.  I think it was Reggie, right?  It might have been Reggie.  Yeah, I think it was Reggie.  Look at all these controversial sports guys saying crazy things, these NBA guys, these  fucking guys with gang tattoos. 
[00:59:30]  You see Snoop, who's an ex-gangbanger, doing AOL commercials.  I just don't buy the outrage, and it's too selective.  It's too arbitrary.  Like, why would AOL or any corporation hire Snoop to do commercials?  Knowing his background.  He throws up gang signs.  And he should be, and I think he should be.  I think he should.  Worked with AOL.  Absolutely, he should be allowed to.  But it's kind of hypocritical if you think about it.  Yes.  What AOL did was they made a decision.  They said, are we going to lose money because of this, or are we going to make money because 
[01:00:00]  of this?  But I want to just go back to one thing that Jimmy said, which is a really important  point, which is that maybe they have elements in their contract that prevents them from doing  that.  And I don't know if that's the case here.  He may, a lot of these professional athletes have things that say, you know,  if they get arrested for drunk driving, even though that's not a fireable offense in  any job, that they can get, they can get fired and they can get fined by, by the company. 
[01:00:30]  I think, I think they do.  I think they do, bro.  And I don't, again, I don't say the corporation doesn't have the right to not be humiliated  by employees' behavior.  My point is a bigger point that we as a country, if this country didn't operate that way, if  we didn't try to have people penalized for saying things we don't like, the corporations  wouldn't care what you did, because their bottom line wouldn't be affected.  It shouldn't be affected.  The fact that any, like, the fucking fact that these fucking citizens down there, I don't  know if they're Cubans or if they were born here, would protest this guy when these motherfuckers 
[01:01:00]  hate the fact that Castro is a repressive regime.  Right.  And they're doing the same thing.  That shows you how fucking fraudulent we are.  Sure.  They're doing the same fucking thing.  Same exact thing.  Yeah.  That's why they left.  They should say, we hate what he said, but.  That's why they got on a car door.  Yes.  And floated to America.  They didn't want to deal with that shit.  What if I say I have a shitty product?  Huh?  What if I say our company manufactures a shitty product? 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That hurts the product.  That hurts the product.  And I understand why the company without a problem with that.  Now the consequence for, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  Now the consequence for what you said is actually the consequence for what you said, not the  fact that you expressed an idea.  You're saying the company I work for makes a bad product, and they're saying, well, get  the fuck out then.  They're absolutely allowed to do that, but that's the consequence. 
[01:02:00]  No, that's the consequence, though, to what you said.  No, it's, it's, there is a difference.  I acknowledge that.  Yeah, it's, it's.  There is.  There is a difference.  Huge difference.  Right.  And, uh, again, why not look at the people.  It still hurts the product.  Okay, but any opinion hurts.  Okay, then we should come to this place.  Can I, can I ask?  Any opinion hurts the product.  Here's, here's the, the question I want to answer.  How many, how many Cuban Americans go to a, uh, Miami Marlins game?  Uh, five if you slice, what?  Wait a minute. 
[01:02:30]  Do you know the answer to that, Dan?  Velcro on the ceiling?  I don't know.  I think that, look, I know, um, that, that the Cuban American population in Miami has,  is huge.  I mean.  Yeah, we all know that.  We know that.  I don't, I don't know what percentage of the audience they are, but I would think that  it's probably pretty high.  Maybe it's a huge population.  So I guess the Cuban American population, which hates the repressive, horrible nature 
[01:03:00]  of Fidel Castro, when they hear something they disagree with, should behave in a manner  which would be repressive.  They should force somebody to toe the ideological line they toe.  That's good.  That's very consistent.  It seems like most of them haven't learned a thing by coming to America.  Okay, but, but just, I, I gather your perspective because you're in the business of free speech.  And, uh, you know, obviously you're, you have a different perspective.  I don't agree with it.  I think it's absurd that, uh, that they would take this, uh, that they would take this line 
[01:03:30]  because, again, Jimmy, you're right.  I, I, I think Jimmy's making a great point.  And I think the Cuban Americans down there in Miami should maybe rise up and say exactly  what Jimmy said.  We hate what he said, but the beauty of this country is he has the right to say it.  Why can't people fucking accept that?  That would be a wonderful day for me if, if that happened.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy makes an amazing point with that.  And they haven't learned a fucking thing.  They've learned nothing.  And by the way, and don't, and you're right, sir, we are in the business of free speech, 
[01:04:00]  but everybody values it.  Try to tell one of those fucking Cuban Americans or any of them, you can't hang that flag on  the back of your car because we feel that national pride is more important than ethnic or pride  from your home country.  So, you know what?  Don't hang up those Puerto Rican day parade flags.  Don't hang up a Cuban flag.  Don't do the, don't hang up any flag you want to, whoa, whoa, this is America.  I got the right to express myself.  They would fucking scream.  This is America.  We got the right to express ourselves.  Oh, we're heading toward that, by the way. 
[01:04:30]  I think.  The problem is it's not, it's not binary.  It's not yes or no.  There's a line.  And, and that's the thing that keeps coming up, which is, well, if I can say this, why  can't I say this?  And, and so I agree it needs to be one or the other.  I need to, I need to be able to say, you know, I love Hitler and, and not get fired or be  able to say, you know, I hate, I hate my company.  Well, one of our, one of our points we're making today, there's not, there's not really 
[01:05:00]  a line that's very, it's, it's always been extremely gray and very, and, and if you look  at it in line terms, it's a very thick grayish line that's fuzzy on the edges.  Open for interpretation a lot of times.  That moves, that, that you could push it further away or bring it back.  And right now, I think in our society, that whole thing is being brought way back toward  us again.  Because do you remember years ago, I mean, we don't remember, none of us remember, but McCarthyism,  and I know that they were targeting them legally and through legal proceedings, but it was about 
[01:05:30]  who your friends were, what your affiliations were, and it was bad for the country and your  communists and blah, blah, blah.  Guilt by association.  Guilt by association.  And it's a different type of a witch hunt now.  It's quieter.  It's fucking sneakier.  McCarthy's a piece of shit, but at least he was fucking up, up front about it.  Yeah, yeah.  At least he was up front about what he was doing.  And there was a short period of time when people were behind him.  He then crossed this arbitrary or gray area or line when people started saying, wait a  minute, what the fuck is he doing? 
[01:06:00]  Because it's starting to impact me.  But when, when it first started out, he had the public behind him.  He was a hero.  Right.  Right.  Because he said he was going to.  Yeah, the communists were going to take over.  Hell yeah.  He was fighting the good fight.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  We got to take a break.  We appreciate the phone call, though.  We, we have a guy named Jason online who's where he says he's Charles Manson's grandson  and wants to tell his story.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Keep him on the line.  Could someone talk to him during the break? 
[01:06:30]  See if he's legit and all that.  There's no real answer here today, to be honest with you.  No.  You know.  No, it's, it's always been very open to interpretation.  The gray area.  That's why it's constantly in the courts being challenged.  Right.  Because there's no line.  You can't look in a book and say, oh, well, I was allowed to say that.  See, it says right here.  Eh.  It's that weird gray area, so.  And a lot of you people are right by saying it's not about freedom of speech, but that's  what scares us that all of a sudden it moved to the corporations to have all this power. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  What's acceptable and what's not.  We've seen in our own lives in this dumb business.  Yep.  So you're right when you make that point.  It didn't help that, yeah, the stadium's in the middle of Little Havana down there.  Whoops.  All right.  Hey, Joel McHale's coming in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Joel McHale.  Maybe today is the day he trashes Chevy Chase.  Just maybe today is the day. 
[01:07:30]  Or just to, I wouldn't like him to address it, because I think he will, too.  It's a big story.  It's fucking.  Maybe for lack of me giving him little jabs.  Maybe there's some light, finally.  You know?  Yeah.  Because he's hinted at some shit, I believe.  And now there's a second voicemail of Chevy Chase kind of trashing community and people  in general.  Do we have that?  Oh, yeah.  We got the second voicemail.  We sure do, Jimmy.  We sure do.  Excuse me.  Almost a sure Jew.  I know.  You know, that doesn't represent. 
[01:08:00]  Doesn't represent the company in a light that we blah-dee-blah.  Blah-dee-blah-blah.  Joel McHale next.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got Joel McHale in studio.  Yes, sir.  Talking about eggs.  Yes.  Too early to eat eggs, huh?  It's too early.  Well, it's like four in the morning for me, so.  Yeah, that's right.  My body would, I think it would go into cardiac arrest. 
[01:08:30]  L.A. time.  Yes.  I'm tired.  How are you?  You look good.  Oh, we're up as pups.  Do we look good?  Well, now that in every single radio studio there are our cameras, you're no longer.  Well, not ours.  They only come in for the big stars like yourself, Joel.  The lead singer of The Cure is shooting us today.  Robert Smith has a job.  Thank you.  Punk is alive and well.  Is Robert Smith alive still?  Yes, he is. 
[01:09:00]  Are they still playing The Cure?  Yes, they are, I believe.  Well, I would have said no.  What?  No, he's alive.  He seems like the kind of guy that wouldn't be alive.  He's like someone who eats in the morning, I think.  Yeah, yeah, see?  I think a lot of the emo people look up to him, right?  Well, sure.  See?  She knows.  Yeah.  I think it's one of the most underrated bands in history.  Thank you.  Well.  You like The Cure?  Thank you.  I will put in my steak.  They wrote so many catchy songs that everyone forgets about.  What's a big song by them?  I don't know any of their stuff. 
[01:09:30]  Well, Friday I'm in Love was kind of the most poppiest song.  Of course it was.  That was very poppy.  But that, wow, now I'm blanking on this.  So am I.  E-Rock, you play one?  Do I play one?  No, no, I'm asking.  No, we'll have to play a couple.  What's that Show Me, Show Me, Show Me, Show Me?  Show Me, Show Me, Show Me, how you do that trick.  Wow.  He's spelling Cure with a K.  Oh, yeah, Boys Don't Cry.  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah, this is now 30 years old. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  The listeners are going like, what is this?  What are you playing?  What's this?  John Philip Sousa?  Yeah, why are you playing classic rock?  What the?  It is considered classic rock.  It is.  It's weird to listen to classic rock stations now.  It's like, wait a minute.  I kind of remember when that was new.  Coming back with another police song.  The new version of Don't Stand So Cliff to Me, 1986.  When there's a metal song, like a song off Goodbye to Romance by Ozzy, when they play 
[01:10:30]  it on a fucking light FM, you're like, oh, no.  See?  Yeah.  I'm just finished.  It's been assimilated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was the Prince of Darkness biting the heads off that.  Yes.  And now it's easy listening.  Safe enough for a department store or a deli.  Hey, everybody, I want to get on my crazy train.  Right now we're at Sleep Train, where they are selling mattresses.  It is amazing, too, that commercial, the bands have no qualms anymore about letting their  songs be in car commercials and stuff.  It used to be, man, your credibility's gone, man. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  You're selling out.  Now it's just, I'm making, I'm buying in, son.  Remember how Led Zeppelin would not do it?  That was it.  Yeah.  He would never do it.  Neil Young wouldn't do it.  Cadillac.  Yeah.  Cadillac.  The Who.  R.E.M. still has not done it.  Really?  No.  Oh, really?  Wow.  But what's so bad about using your song to sell a product?  Like, it's this really phony stand artist make.  Like, who cares if your song is selling a product?  Yeah.  Big fucking deal.  You've already made money off of it.  Cars are terrible?  Yeah.  Well, I can see if it's easy to sell child porn, but if they're selling cars, who gives 
[01:11:30]  a fuck?  Yeah, that's what children's porn needs to finally get it into the mainstream market.  Popular song.  Didn't you sell out by making a popular song, by the way?  Right?  You're already sold out, so why not have it part of a commercial?  I think Nine Inch Nails needs to finally start selling stuff.  Yeah, that would be a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you promoting a community or a gig?  I'm promoting community on Thursday.  But tonight, I'm on Jimmy Fallon, and then tomorrow and Friday, Live with Kelly. 
[01:12:00]  Really?  Oh, man.  You're doing that.  Co-hosted.  Yes.  Do you feel compelled to kind of do the Regis thing?  What?  Yeah.  Ha!  What are you?  Ha!  I'm just going to scream until they can't understand.  It was so good when they would drag it.  He was the best sport.  It was great when they would drag the computer expert on.  I remember those segments, and it's like, what is this?  I don't even know how this works.  What's with this foot pedal?  Now, where do you put the water to heat up the steam to get the scream going?  You're a very good Regis guy. 
[01:12:30]  That's just one of those, just plug your nose and talk.  He's alive and well, by the way.  He's at my gym a lot now.  Oh, you see him at the gym?  A lot.  I used to see him every once in a while, but now he's like, he's really not doing much.  Well, he will go on forever, because most people who retire will be like, I'm just going to  sit around.  But no, he's like, I need to get to the gym more.  He didn't want to retire.  He was hoping that someone would have picked him up by now.  That was a contract dispute.  Yes.  Oh, I didn't know any of that.  Do they want to retire?  Oh, I'm going to bring this up tomorrow during the show.  Please do.  Talk about it. 
[01:13:00]  They'll love it.  Please do.  I did not know that.  I wonder if, how are they doing without him?  Does it matter at all?  Is it affecting ratings?  I think it's all right.  Kelly is an unstoppable force.  People love Kelly, that's for sure, yeah.  She is so wonderful.  She's really cool.  You've met her before.  Yeah, we like her.  She's like the nicest woman around and way, way too hot.  I'm very sexually attracted to her.  Okay, I'll let her know.  She knows.  She's read the letters.  Send the photos.  I write them on death certificates.  Jimmy goes, she knows. 
[01:13:30]  I've seen the name on the restraining order.  I met her and her husband together.  He's a fucking, Mark Consuelos, it's embarrassing.  He's a handsome dude.  Very handsome.  Their kids are going to be like genius models.  They have no kids?  No, they have three.  I think they have four.  Four?  Yeah, for a while she was just constantly pregnant.  Yeah.  She has accomplished so much more than all of us come to.  Oh my God.  Mother entertainer.  We're just not worthy.  She looks terrible.  Talk about going to the gym.  Do you go?  How often do you go? 
[01:14:00]  I try to get there like every other day.  Really?  And then I'm biking in the park on the off days.  That's why he's got that body.  I know it doesn't look it, but, you know, I'm trying.  No, for radio, you are.  That body doesn't come without a price.  Look at that fucking thing.  God damn.  I'm barely keeping it together at this point.  Jim, barely.  When was the last time you walked by a gym?  I do a lot of elliptical.  Really?  Yes, but I've been doing Weight Watchers points and have been quite tuckered out lately from  my lack of food.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, but I'll go like three times a week and just do something for my heart. 
[01:14:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Heart health.  Three times a week?  Yeah.  Still?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's what it is.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  I'm ignoring the incredulous tone because I want to stay for the rest.  No, no, you're right, though.  I don't look like I really do, but I try to just for the stage.  I feel like if I'm doing an hour on stage, I want to be able to breathe.  That is a workout, though.  No, it's not easy.  No, being on stage, though, is a sweaty...  Well, I panic.  I panic on stage, and I'm like, I can't breathe.  I used to have panic attacks on stage.  Whoa, that's got to suck.  Yeah.  Whoa.  What an unpleasant... 
[01:15:00]  So before shows, you'd just be freaking out?  No, on stage, I would be like, I can't breathe.  You're going to pass out.  Whoa.  And I finally stopped doing that by going, just shut up, fucking pussy.  Pass out.  I got so mad at myself.  Then just pass out already.  The people in the audience are like, fuck, is he remembering himself?  No, but I would stand there and hold on to something.  I would get lightheaded.  Your dick.  Yeah.  Because I...  Did you guys know that I never...  Back in like 2003, 2004.  No, I didn't know he actually went through that.  So your Lincoln Center special, were you...  No, it was fine there.  That was 2007.  Okay.  He figured it out by then. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I was okay by then.  But he did wear a tinfoil hat.  He was afraid of aliens.  Yes.  Jimmy's a very frightened young boy.  I'm not very frightened of everything.  Hey, what's up with Chevy, man?  There's another voicemail.  Here we go.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's make some press today.  Gillian was here.  And beautiful and talented and lovely.  She is such a friggin' pisser, man.  She's a lot of fun.  And we were talking to her about it.  And she...  I don't know.  She didn't say anything.  Right.  Officially.  Her body language. 
[01:16:00]  Everyone always makes a face like...  Like, oh, that guy is...  So, all right.  Look, look.  I'll phrase it in a way that's it.  All right.  Joel.  We know Chevy's the biggest prick you've ever worked with.  Who's the second?  Oh.  My word.  I'm going to go with Kelly.  No.  Kelly, yeah, that ripper.  It almost feels like he's trying to sabotage the show.  Like, why would he want to do that?  The one they...  I don't know.  One of those things.  I got on a plane yesterday. 
[01:16:30]  And when I came off, they're like, so how about that voicemail?  Have we heard it?  I was like, oh, shit.  One plane ride, and then there's another voicemail.  Another voicemail.  I haven't heard it.  I haven't heard it.  I literally haven't heard the second one.  You haven't heard it yet?  I haven't heard it.  I haven't heard it.  I read a transcript of it.  Why don't we hear it?  I get the transcripts from all the shows.  Yeah.  You've got to get the transcripts.  Look at this.  Joel's like, oh, great.  Here we go.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  We might stop it a few times.  I've got to work with this guy.  Could you not?  I'm just glad to see a CD.  That's pretty extreme.  That's kind of dumb. 
[01:17:00]  Digital.  Who's he talking to?  Dan.  First of all, it's just, hi, Dan.  It's Chevy.  And Joel just goes, oh, boy.  I have a feeling Joel might have had a few of these calls.  Oh, God.  I know.  Hi, Joel.  It's Chevy.  Chevy and I do text each other, but the only thing, Chevy and I text each other onion headlines.  That's his thing.  Oh, yeah.  That's his thing.  That's our relationship.  Very funny.  Who's Dan again?  Dan Harmon.  Dan Harmon is the creator of the show.  Creator, okay.  The creator.  Chevy.  Chevy Chase. 
[01:17:30]  I've looked at now three shows in a row.  That's last week and a couple this week.  I've watched more than that, but the point I want to make is this.  There's a disconnect somewhere, either between what is actually shot and the humor on the 
[01:18:00]  set when we shoot it and the final product, the editing.  I don't know who's doing the editing and making the choices that count the most.  Now, hold on for a second.  He pretty much described the entire show.  It's like there seems to be a disconnect between everything.  The acting, the mood in the studio, the recording of it, the editing. 
[01:18:30]  I don't like the way the credits roll at the end.  But I'll tell you, this is getting...  Dan Harmon leaked the first one.  He played it and it got leaked and he felt bad about it.  He apologized for playing that message.  But this is another one to him and this is a much better quality one.  I don't know what their relationship is, but it just sounds like he's had enough of hearing  from this guy.  And we're just speculating here.  We are just speculating.  I'm not even speculating.  And you're not speculating.  We're speculating with you in the room.  You're like a litmus paper.  Thank you.  He doesn't have to talk, but we can look at it and know exactly what's going on. 
[01:19:00]  It also means I'm thin.  That's true, too.  He's moving a lot in his chair.  He's a litmus paper thing.  Joel is fidgeting about.  What was Gillian doing?  She put her head down.  She'd look up and out of the corner of the eye, look up and smile a little.  It was way cuter than what I'm doing.  Oh, adorable.  Well, you're pretty cute, too.  Thank you.  But she also...  I think I saw her mouth...  Fuck that Chevy.  Wow.  I'm teasing, of course.  We don't know for sure, right?  You can't blow up your own show.  I understand that. 
[01:19:30]  So get to work with this person.  It's a real thing.  But he's being very...  He's kind of...  This is public stuff now, and it's getting to a point where it looks like it's hurting  the perception of the show, and it's a good show.  But at least we are picked up for a fourth season.  Oh, you are?  Good, good, good.  No, we're not.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm joking.  I think it will be, though.  I hope so.  But I'm saying this...  That's why I said it almost seems sabotaging.  This helps.  This helps.  He wants to stop, Joel.  Chevy didn't release this stuff?  No, I don't. 
[01:20:00]  Okay.  No, no.  I don't know how Chevy could have...  He didn't release this stuff, but it just seems like he's a very difficult guy.  But if you ask Chevy to release a voicemail, it would be impossible for him to figure it  out.  So it'd be like, take that off the phone.  So I want to do that.  What?  Yeah.  But I will say this.  The other part of the disconnect is that, obviously, you don't get my humor.  I don't get my humor at all.  That's true.  Or what it is I do that's funny that actually makes people laugh. 
[01:20:30]  I do agree with that.  You've got two choices.  What is he doing?  Is that Dan Harmon?  Is that Dan talking over?  That's Dan talking over?  That's Dan talking over.  Wow.  Well, it's...  Yeah, it's...  That's true.  Wow, that's brutal.  I guess it's not technically a voicemail.  Wow.  No, when you're talking.  He's fucking commenting on it.  Wow.  Or maybe Dan's voicemail is set up that it'll agree with what you're saying.  Yeah, I agree with that.  That would be great.  What if this is a discussion?  A lot of people.  No, no, this is a voicemail.  Oh, he's his highest Chevy.  I think he's just fucking giving his comments over the voicemail. 
[01:21:00]  As he's recording it.  I think.  He's talking.  Yeah.  Wow.  I do agree with that.  Two choices.  One is storyline.  The other is, you know, like everybody gives a shit about the fucking story when they don't  even know who the fucking characters are.  Ooh.  Yes.  Or there's make people laugh.  Now, you know what I do.  And I don't appreciate, you know, like a great joke, like the cast being ripped off my, you 
[01:21:30]  know, and pointing out all the funny things that are on in my cast that I've tried to scratch.  Not the cast.  And it's just cut out.  Right.  It's just cut out.  There's just one line about some kind of a thing I eat that was in my cast.  When you had big laughs.  That's just physical.  I'm just talking about laughing.  Again, tonight, I'm looking at two.  I'm doing shit in that place on a wheelchair. 
[01:22:00]  It's cut.  I think this would be better if we put music to it.  So that what?  So that people can follow the storyline between Joel and Gillian.  Hey.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And love affairs and kissing.  Come on, man.  You're missing the point.  I mean, I really, this is not my kind of comedy.  I thought you hired me for what I can do that's funny.  You've got to give me some range. 
[01:22:30]  And then you don't have some editor with no sense of humor.  No sense.  No sense of me.  Cutting things down to the point where I just look like a...  I don't like it.  And, you know, I should have had this talk to you face-to-face.  But I didn't want to because I really like you.  I think your writing is great.  I think everything you do is great.  But the problem really is, Dan, you're not there when we shoot.  And you're not there when they edit. 
[01:23:00]  So you don't even know what you have.  You don't even know what it is I'm f***ing doing.  And if you want me on this f***ing show again, I got news for you.  I don't want it.  It's just a f***ing mediocre sitcom.  Wow.  I want people to laugh.  And this isn't funny.  And it ain't funny to me because I'm 67 years old.  And I've been doing this a long time.  Every year of it.  And I've been making a lot of people laugh a lot better than this. 
[01:23:30]  Joel?  Good times.  Joel, comment.  Everything's comfortable all the time.  So good.  That is a little...  Well, here's the good news.  Yes, sir.  That was apparently, from what I read, was over a year old.  Really?  So...  Oh, is that a year old?  That's the other thing.  It's a year old.  See, we didn't know that.  And he's...  So he came back.  So it all worked out.  So it all worked out.  Everything is good now.  That's very good. 
[01:24:00]  No, that was the other thing.  That was because it said in the article, at least I think it was the Huffington Post article,  it was like this is from over a year ago or a year ago.  Because he said he's 67.  He's almost 69 now.  Oh, man.  Wow.  So the plot thickened.  It was whoever, you know.  Do you think they gave him what he wanted?  More of the funny?  Yeah.  Well, more importantly, why are these voicemails coming out now?  Right.  That's what confuses me.  Who has them? 
[01:24:30]  And why do they feel like they need to release this now?  Somebody's trying to sabotage something or get him...  Why would the creator do that if they're trying to get picked up for a fourth season?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know who...  It's his voicemail, so it starts with him.  Yeah, but I don't know where...  You know, in a year's time, what happens to those things.  Right.  Yeah, but you know what's great is that it's great to talk about.  It's fun.  Right.  It's fun.  It's so uncomfortable.  It's comfortable.  It's good times.  It's a great buzz.  What was the first...  It's like, you know, being on the Kardashians. 
[01:25:00]  What was the first...  No matter what, it's all good press.  What was the first sign that there was something...  I'm not saying you have trouble with him.  What was the first sign that there was tension?  Because you see tension sometimes.  What was the first sign that there was going to be some kind of a tension?  Was it an argument with a writer, or was it...  I think, like, the second day of work, Chevy strangled an extra...  No, no, boy, no, you know, I swear to you when I say this, that the cast does get along  well, and Chevy is very... 
[01:25:30]  He can be very warm on set, and...  But, you know, just like everyone can get into bad moods, and...  Like, Jim, when you walked in, you literally slapped me in the face.  But I don't mind being...  But honestly, we all get pissy here.  We do.  It's part of a working relationship.  People tend to hear when we are, because they can hear us in a live moment, so they  kind of know, like, he's feeling shittier, and he's right, whatever.  But on sitcoms, it happens too, and it's just like this now, it's become a public...  Right, now everyone, yeah.  And it looks divisive. 
[01:26:00]  Because they're not taping that stuff, usually.  Right.  No.  And it's like, you know, it's Chevy being Chevy, and...  See, but the reputation is terrible for him, and it's like, you don't want to believe  it, like, not you, but I mean, like, myself, it's like, alright, everybody says he's  a hard guy to work with, and he's a funny dude.  Yeah.  But he's difficult to work with, and nobody likes him.  And then he's like, he's on this show with a much younger cast.  It's almost like a more relevant thing than he's done in a long time.  Yeah.  And he's just motherfucking everybody.  It's like, what...  It's like, do you not see that you're the common denominator in every situation you're  in?  It's you. 
[01:26:30]  Look.  Anyway.  Just Like Heaven?  What's great about these Cure songs that...  You want to go with Just Like Heaven?  That was the one I was trying to come up with.  Just Like Heaven.  Yes.  That's what I was trying to come up with.  That's what I want to say what the set is like.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  See, if you played this song underneath the voicemail...  Underneath the voicemail.  It would sound much better.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Play a little bit of the voicemail.  Well, I guess I could do that.  Oh, you put it away.  Wow.  I did put it away.  I was going to throw it in the garbage.  Oh, God bless you.  Here, start this over, because this is a long intro.  Yeah.  So it'll work.  But this intro really, like, you know...  Oh, the intro kicks in and everything. 
[01:27:00]  Makes it exciting.  I hated it.  You're out.  It's Chevy.  See?  Chevy.  Chevy Chase.  This sounds like the beginning of a great 80s movie.  Yeah.  I've booked it now three shows in a row.  I feel like we're about to hit a dance.  That's last week.  Wait, was that other voicemail that went public recent?  I've watched more than that.  That one was recent.  Oh, that's why...  Okay, that's why he released the other one.  He's probably tired of getting these.  I would listen to this song.  Yeah.  You know something?  I've got to be honest with you.  If a cast gets taken off of your leg, and a bunch of stuff falls out that you've been 
[01:27:30]  scratching your leg with, that's pretty fucking funny.  And that happened.  We showed that.  When it opened up, he had, like, nine pepperoni sticks, and everything he had shoved in there  to scratch.  Yeah, to scratch.  Yeah, he had hangers and...  Oh, I agree with that.  That's kind of funny.  A plastic knife.  Yeah, and that all happened.  Did it make the final cut?  It did make that.  It made the final cut.  There's, you know, because the...  Well, he was wearing a body cast in that, and we thought that he had stolen a pen. 
[01:28:00]  So we sawed it off, and sawed his cast off.  And when he took it off, we were all almost vomited from the smell.  That was all in the script.  So that all went well.  I thought that was a good episode.  Actually, it was the bottle episode, which we were just looking for a pen, and...  Does it bother you to hear him mention your name like that?  Because he's not motherfucking.  He's not saying you're not funny.  No, it's Jenny Jay saying my name excites me.  But is it annoying?  No one sees that part of it.  Like, in the context of, well, how come you're showing this and not my thing? 
[01:28:30]  Well, I disagree with him about story.  I think it's important to...  Right.  You have to tell the story and tell great jokes at the same time to forward it along.  But that's kind of like a weird, like, well, darn it, these stories...  No, but, yeah, no, that doesn't bother me.  Just as long as I didn't look that dumb kissing.  Right.  You don't want to look dumb kissing.  No, never.  It's like running.  If you run on camera, you better look cool.  Because that...  Well, well...  Just imagine if James Bond did not look cool. 
[01:29:00]  No.  Well, we did, in fact...  Or kissing.  Speak with Maggie.  Or both at the same time.  Maggie.  Maggie, uh...  From Taken?  Yeah, what's her name?  Shannon, uh...  No, that was her name in Lost.  Maggie Grace.  Maggie Grace.  Maggie Grace, very good.  Shannon in Lost, and she was in the movie Taken.  She's very attractive.  Yes, yes, yes.  But, man, when she runs, it just is hilariously awkward and awful for her run.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  But she's like a really tall woman, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  That's like getting a giraffe to run.  Exactly, yeah.  Like the giraffe is majestic, but when it drinks water, it's like, what's it doing?  It looks very silly.  God had not put in the kickstand in the right spot on the giraffe for it.  Yeah, they've got to do that thing with their front legs.  When was she in?  When was she in?  Last week?  Yeah, last week.  What was she promoting?  Another movie, Lockout.  A movie that I won't say.  Lockdown, Lockout.  The one with Guy Pearce.  Yes!  The Prison Planet.  The Prison Planet.  Yeah, I'm up on all my Prison Planet movies.  A la Alien 3, I believe.  A la...  There was also one with Christopher Lambert. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  Which I know you guys love your Christopher Lambert movies of recent history.  Of course we know.  Ever since Highlander.  Highlander.  And Highlander 3.  And Highlander.  Remember Christopher Lambert?  He was around for a while.  Yeah, he was.  And then he disappeared.  Yeah.  There's a few of them from that era.  Someone look up the Christopher Lambert Prison Planet movie.  Yeah.  Do you have people that would...  We normally have someone sitting right there in the computer control seat, but not today 
[01:30:30]  so much.  Why not?  What is...  Because he's over there.  Oh, Sam Roberts is over there.  Oh, he's manning that camera that doesn't move.  Two cameras.  Start the camera.  No, I mean, you can pretty much just start the camera and let it roll.  Yeah.  He's not moving.  He's not moving.  Not moving.  Oh, now he's moving on purpose.  Not moving.  Oh, Sam.  Chevy Chase, look.  You keep moving.  I'm not going to move.  If you're not going to move the camera, why would you even stand there?  You know, it's just this thing. 
[01:31:00]  It's everything.  It's the way you shoot.  The way you're standing there.  Joel moving and kissing Jimmy.  It's awkward.  They at one time had that not awkward kiss that I was into.  Chevy should use a megaphone.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the universal thing of the telephone.  You could always go...  I like that.  Or also the...  I don't think you're flying an altitude of 35,000 feet.  It's airline pilot and telephone.  Oh, I thought that was a baby. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a baby monitor.  That's exactly...  Shut up.  Oh, those monitors.  Oh, is that really what it does?  Yeah.  Well, you do...  This is what you hear all night.  It's just...  And then...  And then you're...  He's so right.  Is that it?  And as a parent, you're like...  Okay, it's okay.  Oh, my God.  That must be very anxious. 
[01:32:00]  Yes, it keeps you...  Waiting for the next breath.  It keeps you...  You never get...  I didn't dream for about nine months because I was on edge the whole time.  Wow.  That's got to be...  Yeah, get anxious.  Yeah.  Andy Richter tweeted about having set up his baby monitor the wrong way.  And he was like, man, I guess you're not supposed to let your kids hear you have sex.  That's funny.  It was pretty.  It was good.  Do you have a video one?  That doesn't make any sense to me because... 
[01:32:30]  I mean, it's when it's like, wait, is the kid getting...  I need confirmation when the kid is screaming.  You're like, oh, he's fine.  He's fine.  I like the video part.  Yeah?  Yeah, because you can see that he's still in the damn crib.  What if he...  Where is he going?  It's a wide angle?  Well, we've never used it because, unlike you, we were too scared, so he's still in our bed.  How old?  I have an almost two-year-old.  Oh, dude.  I'm going to be chubby case.  Dude, I fucked up.  I know.  Dude, you've got to break it up.  He has no idea that he's supposed to have his own room.  He has no clue.  Oh. 
[01:33:00]  We fucked it up.  I don't like the video for the baby monitor.  I don't think it's been edited properly.  It was some very funny stuff the baby was doing.  By the way, it's chubby case.  Imagine rolling over in the middle of the night, you look in the video monitor, and the baby's gone.  That would be the start of a nice movie, right?  Or if his face is two inches from the camera lens, you just...  That would be frightening.  But in your case, you'd be like, where's the baby?  And then you turn over.  Ah, right next to me.  Like he's been for two years.  We might have fucked up on that one a little bit.  Because now it's going to be hell on earth.  Yeah, it's going to break. 
[01:33:30]  Because you don't understand.  Where's the baby?  Oh, he's got the car keys.  He's leaving.  But here's...  You should incentivize it.  Oh.  That sounds like a very hip word.  There was a time when my kid would wake up at like four in the morning.  It was like, it's party time.  We're getting up now.  And so we went and bought...  Valium?  Little airplane booze.  No.  No.  Hot wheels cars and cheap ones.  We put them into a big plastic bin.  It's like for every morning that you stay in your bed, you get a car.  So after 4,000 small cars, you finally got it. 
[01:34:00]  No, but actually it worked within four days at work.  How old are your kids?  I don't know.  Four and seven.  But this is when he was...  This is when he was about two.  All right.  Yeah.  Because he's finally starting to comprehend shit.  So...  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to bribe him.  And then with each day...  It's a bribe.  Yeah.  It's a bribe.  You learn to bribe your kids.  Jim is just like, oh boy, they're talking about kids again.  I'm just going to keep on scrolling through my Twitter feed.  Tweet, tweet, tweet.  What do I got here? 
[01:34:30]  But yeah, you should...  I know people...  No, we understand.  We've got to figure it out.  It's stupid.  Yeah, because the more you do it, the harder it will be.  Is training a child pretty much like training a dog?  Is that what I'm getting here?  Yeah.  I think it's a lot more complicated than Uncle Paul.  It's hard.  In some ways, it's harder and better.  Because once they figure it out, then you don't.  Yeah.  But a dog won't kick you in the face.  Like my dad...  I put my kid in the car, and then he'll be like, Daddy, you didn't fasten the straps. 
[01:35:00]  What's wrong with you?  Oh.  And I'll be like, oh, of course I remembered.  So he will remind...  Yeah.  But it...  Yeah, it's good times.  Jim, how many kids do you have?  None.  Never even close.  That he knows of.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  No kids.  Never engaged.  Nothing.  Ever.  No, no.  Not even close.  Okay.  I like the kid thing.  It's good times.  It's a lot of work, though.  It is a lot of work.  Look at his face.  It's a lot of work.  But it will be...  It pays off.  It's like restoring a wonderful vintage car. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Eventually, it will be worth a lot of money.  Yeah.  Because a good-looking one is rare.  Do you like that analogy?  It just keeps going.  I think that's pretty good.  You take them around to shows.  Unless your car turns gay.  What?  Oh, you want a gay car.  It only backs into the driveway.  They run well.  You're the best and the most in shape.  What does this have to do with Chevy, though?  Oh.  Please.  Are you deflecting here?  All things go bad.  The white noise.  I know this much. 
[01:36:00]  Community is on tomorrow night at 8 o'clock on NBC.  And people are watching.  Absolutely.  They're back.  Thank God.  You don't know if you're going to get another season, huh?  No.  None of the comedies have been picked up yet.  Last week we did a Ken Burns documentary, which I know you love, right, Jim?  I do like Ken Burns.  We like the Ken Burns.  And they actually get, you know, Keith David, the guy that does, he's got the greatest voice  actor in Platoon.  Oh, yeah.  He's a great scene in Crash.  Got us a Crusader.  And in Requiem for a Dream as the heroin dealer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he did the voiceover, which he does all the Ken Burns documentaries. 
[01:36:30]  So I don't even know.  Yes.  Tomorrow night.  So please watch.  He's the guy that does the Ken Burns voiceover.  Yeah.  Like he did the jazz.  I didn't know that.  He did baseball.  Rich always fucking over the poor.  Always has.  He did.  Always will.  And Platoon?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Got us a Crusader.  Are you a Platoon or a Full Metal Jacket fan?  Full Metal Jacket for the first 45 minutes.  Platoon for the overall thing.  See, I think the last 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is so well informed by the first 45 
[01:37:00]  that it's important to know.  Thank you.  I know a lot of people have split that movie up into two movies.  I kind of like the whole thing, though.  I've grown to really like the second part.  I just liked Hartman so much as a character that when he was gone and Pyle, they lost  two characters that I really loved by the end of the first half of the movie.  Two of the biggest, most important characters in the movie are eliminated.  And then Matthew Modine is just running around going, that's a negative, Rafterman.  That's good.  How dare you?  How dare you?  And Adam Baldwin, I like, but as animal mother, I just didn't find him to be that menacing. 
[01:37:30]  Are you kidding me?  No, I didn't find him to be that menacing.  I like him.  I thought he was wonderful as Linderman.  You're a long friend's animal mother.  Linderman in My Bodyguard.  In My Bodyguard.  But Ruth Gordon should have been patting his fucking wrist.  That was my introduction to him.  And I was just like, this man is my hero.  He's good.  Happy birthday, zipper head.  Like, he had some fucking harsh moments, but I just didn't love, I didn't hate it. 
[01:38:00]  Anyone carrying that gun like that.  I love the old fucking guy.  The old guy, uh, what's that, some kind of sick joke?  He was in the fucking second half of the movie, so.  Oh, that guy.  There is he.  Yeah, here, here he is.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?  Don't you love your country?  Yes, sir.  How about getting with the program?  Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?  For the big win.  I could listen to him talk about anything, anything.  He's a great character, too, yeah.  He was in for two seconds.  Now, are you Saving Private Ryan or Thin Red Line? 
[01:38:30]  Two World War.  Saving Private Ryan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never saw Thin Red Line, but I would say Saving Private Ryan was a good movie.  Saving Private Ryan, that'll make you.  I'll make a tear up a little bit.  Here he goes.  Reminds him of the war he was in.  Yeah.  That's right.  W, W, W, 2.  Yeah, I remember.  It's too real for you.  Reminds you of other World War II movies you've seen.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that's one of those things.  I think that's the only thing that ever gets me.  I'm pretty fucking impervious to emotion. 
[01:39:00]  What about Toy Story 3?  Yeah, that got me, too.  But when you see, like, soldiers from World War II.  When you see an older Matt Damon.  Right.  The old Matt Damon.  Asking if he was a good man.  Oh, boy.  Toy Story 3.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Toy Story 3 was very emotional.  You ever see Band of Brothers at the end when they showed the real guys, and they're talking  about it?  Oh, yeah, of course.  And he's like.  That was, yeah.  And then my grandson asked me if I was a hero in the war, and I said, no, but I served 
[01:39:30]  amongst them.  And he was all.  And that makes you go.  Oh, it's like, come on.  He went screaming, naked, crying.  Yes.  See, I think the thing.  Jello in my hair.  On, what is it?  Full Metal Jacket.  Greatest ending.  After they burn the town down.  They've been hit by the sniper.  The sniper, they're walking away from, the town is on fire, and they're singing the Mickey  Mouse Clubhouse song.  And I just thought, yep.  That really does get me.  It's great.  That wraps it up.  How did we get to this?  I don't know.  What happened, Joel? 
[01:40:00]  Is that Chevy on the phone?  He's good at deflecting.  Now we're talking about war movies.  Oh, I know.  We're not going to get anything out of this guy.  See, because on the soup, he just talks about everything.  Do you think there's too many energy drinks on the shelves these days ago?  I mean, seriously.  I still stick to coffee.  I love your talk soup, too, man.  Well, it's just the soup.  We say it every time.  I know it's called just the soup.  Well, now that there's 12 shows about hand fishing.  It's amazing that you're on a show where, at the beginning, it was just about talk shows, 
[01:40:30]  and you'd play the weird clips from Springer and whatnot.  And how they expand.  And who knew that this...  Who thought the technology would allow so much crap to be on the air?  So much garbage.  Utter garbage.  How many fucking tow truck shows?  Really?  At one of the last year, we said, we are in the golden age of shows about storage units.  There was 12 storage unit shows on.  Not good enough to have it here.  Let's take it to Texas and see what they do.  Oh, we've got a new twist on it. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a new twist.  Who's pitching the show?  These are locked with keys.  These are combination locks.  It's totally different.  We take it off with a bolt cutter instead of a carborundum saw.  It's very...  Yeah, now it's the hand fishing.  I assume now it'll be about duck hunting with Duck Dynasty finally on the air.  Duck Dynasty.  Duck Dynasty.  Because when I thought of a show, I thought a bunch of hillbillies that made duck calls  and sort of made a fortune out of it.  And what would their lives be like? 
[01:41:30]  Right.  I would...  That's what I want to know about.  Yeah.  But with all this crap, it has allowed for the greatest television of all time to be made.  I mean, Game of Thrones would have never been a movie that was ever on.  Yes.  Or a show.  There would be no network that would put Game of Thrones on.  There's very few beheadings on network television.  Right.  And full frontal nudity.  Or, you know, Breaking Bad or shows like this.  They wouldn't have made it.  What's the go-to show for the soup right now?  Well, Hillbilly Hand Fishing is right up there.  We also love Greg Kelly from Good Day, New York. 
[01:42:00]  And I'm glad you brought that up.  Good Day, New York.  Because you're bringing it to the attention of the nation because he's a local guy.  Yeah.  And he's out of his fucking mind.  And apparently not a rapist.  And he's not a rapist.  He's not a rapist.  I do like someone who just kind of speaks his mind.  Yeah.  And is not that careful.  And it works.  It works really well.  And it works for the soup really well.  You guys do play a lot.  Hoda and Kathy are always good.  Oh, God.  And they're coming on.  We're taping the soup here today in New York.  And they're going to come on.  Really? 
[01:42:30]  So we're going to bring some Chardonnay.  Found a green screen somewhere, did you?  Can you believe?  That's got to be the easiest show to take on the road.  It is.  It's just like, ah, we need a green screen.  That's all we need.  We do not have the.  We forgot the curtain.  All right.  Paint a wall.  Don't have a wall.  All right.  Get some grass.  Yeah.  Lie down on the grass.  And we'll shoot you.  That would be interesting.  That would be, yeah.  Hey, welcome to the soup, everybody.  So.  Yeah, no.  You get more guests on the show, too.  Like, you got celebrities just popping in on you on that show. 
[01:43:00]  They drop by is what we like to call it.  That's pretty good.  Uh, yeah, it works.  It's great.  Yeah.  People like, hey, you're not showing enough clips.  You got Jason Biggs on.  That's my phone.  Sorry.  Oh, that's okay.  Jimmy, let's scroll through that.  Is that Chevy?  It might be Chevy.  You want to answer that?  Uh, Joel, Jimmy.  Look, I didn't appreciate the, that kissing thing and the dialogue.  What do you call that?  Oh, yeah.  Storyline.  Uh, I think me falling down for a half hour would be hilarious. 
[01:43:30]  I could do that.  The cure song is behind it.  I could just, uh, I could actually just say, um, I'm Chevy Chase and you're not.  And then fall down.  Uh, that's what people want.  That's what, uh, isn't that what they're paying for?  For fuck's sake.  If you're happy with your message, press one.  If you'd like to re-record your message, please.  Two.  So, yes. 
[01:44:00]  I like how just like heaven is now married to that.  I know, right?  I love it.  Uh, but Tyler's and Tierra's is also a good one.  That's a great one.  I, I, that show is amongst the most despicable shows I've ever seen.  That and Dance Moms is also great.  Dance, it's just one and the same.  It does show a, the subculture.  That, that you can point on almost any subculture in America.  And it is interesting to watch.  It really is.  Uh, what frightens me is the, the audience seems very small. 
[01:44:30]  It's just the people that I think bring their kids.  And then an occasional person that should be a person of interest.  Right.  In the, uh, in the crowd.  There's a number of conference rooms that are at, at what, the Doubletree Lounge or the  comfort suites or where it is, uh, outside of Oklahoma City or where they are, that those  are used now all the time for these big shows.  All for the pageants.  This is a full glitz pageant.  Right.  We're going to need, uh, the kids made up like little sluts.  Well, the best, she looks like Julia Roberts from. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty woman.  Pretty woman.  And, and, and then, then that woman, that same time, that woman commented a few shows  later, like, now I don't want her to look like a sluts.  I got a lot of blowback from that.  From the prostitution thing.  Where we dress her up like a little prostitute.  I love the fact that they don't even know what they're doing.  They're, they're in a haze looking at their parents who are jumping around like trained  monkeys in the, in the crowd.  Yeah.  And, and they do that blow a kiss thing and they're just like.  Right.  It was like, this is a motion that was taught.  I wish that would happen in the Miss Universe pageant. 
[01:45:30]  I like the look, look far away.  Right.  And then there's this one.  And then.  See, Ant loves this show.  It's hilarious.  You've seen every episode.  Very cute.  It is so horribly hilarious.  They, they, they're prostituting their children out.  Why hasn't Jim said anything in about five minutes?  I don't know.  I don't watch Toddlers and Tiaras.  Jim doesn't watch TV.  Why not?  What's your favorite show?  I like Game of Thrones a lot.  Reality show.  I don't really watch any of them.  They're not, I don't, not better than them.  I did just, I find most of them are not interesting.  He'd watch the soup and be like, I don't know what any of this is. 
[01:46:00]  No, I watch.  What's Joel doing?  I'd say on Discovery I'll watch.  See, that shows he's educated.  The Animals of Pablo Escobar.  If you have a guilty.  It was an interesting show.  He doesn't watch John TV really.  If you have a guilty pleasure, if you, obviously you can't just turn on Game of Thrones while  you're doing the dishes.  Right.  Game of Thrones I enjoy.  You got it.  You got to watch that.  But you would, is it ESPN?  ESPN, is it?  No, nothing really.  I mean, I don't watch Sports anymore.  Jerseylicious.  None of that shit.  I've never seen a full episode of Jersey Shore.  I just don't enjoy it.  I would watch it if I liked it.  What about crime murder shows?  First 48. 
[01:46:30]  Occasionally, I like, I almost got away with it.  I like, the first 48 I don't watch.  But I like.  That's the same episode every time.  I did get away with it.  I got away with it.  No, the one that sucks me in forever is the MSNBC's Lock Up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can watch over, and I'll be like, oh, there's four more on San Quentin.  I better record these.  And doesn't it really make you not want to do anything illegal?  It is the, yes, it is the greatest deterrent from crime.  I watched that and go, I would be dead in a day. 
[01:47:00]  Hopefully only dead.  Because it just looks like the toughest, shittiest place to ever be.  Like, it's such, like, you think, well, there's the death penalty.  No, a greater deterrent, having to use your toilet to wash your clothes.  Right.  And use it as a toilet.  And a shower.  And make booze.  It's a distillery.  It's a toilet.  It's a shower.  It's a toilet.  It's a soup bowl.  It's a toilet.  That is a greater deterrent to me.  Yeah.  And then you see the room they're in, which is much smaller than this room. 
[01:47:30]  Believe it or not.  There's two guys living there.  Yeah.  And then they're like, well, this is our privacy curtain.  And it's a pair of shorts.  And it's crazy.  I can't get enough of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is horrible to watch.  Sit a bunch of kids down just in front of that.  Yeah.  You would think.  Let us know until it works.  Yeah.  Prison.  You still want to go to prison?  You still okay with it?  All right.  Here's lock up Pelican Bay.  Pelican Bay was really good.  That's a good one.  The best is when they're like, well, this prison is very old and it has 3,000 more prisoners 
[01:48:00]  in this building than it should have.  Yeah.  It looks like a dungeon.  They have to rotate.  The other good ones are any of the crime shows where you're not quite sure who did it.  And they've gotten smart.  They used to put, like they'd interview the wife of the dead husband.  And they're interviewing her in an orange jumpsuit with the institutional green wall behind her.  And then they're trying to make it seem like, but who did kill her?  Oh, kill him. 
[01:48:30]  And I'm like, well, she...  Right.  Now they like slap a dickie on him and put like some curtains and stuff behind the person.  And they're being interviewed.  And then at the end you're like, they were in prison the whole time.  Dang it.  Because how did they get such terrific lighting?  Yeah, they got that nice, like, news lighting where it's like, why is a blue light shooting  through that window?  It's fantastic.  What's that guy's name?  I don't like the lighting.  I'm that kind of assuming.  If you could light the prison window a little more realistically, for fuck's sake.  I mean, it just doesn't look like this person's in prison. 
[01:49:00]  It looks too happy.  And, uh, you know, I know comedy.  What can I say?  Sorry, Joel.  Yeah.  I do like it when the MC lock up.  When they lock up, they'll be, they'll cut to like, and here's his wife.  They've locked up his wife because she was trying to smuggle drugs into the prison.  And it'll be like, and they have two kids at home.  And it'll be like, oh, what, how did it get to this point?  Why?  Yeah, you're being a dad now.  You're very protective of your kids. 
[01:49:30]  Yes.  And you wouldn't do things like that.  What's the mindset in somebody that they would just.  And it'd be like, hon, just smuggle some drugs in your butt.  Once for me.  Just one time.  I swear this will be the one time you can do it.  Don't you get your ready-made whore to bring it up to you?  I already tried that.  She is in jail.  So please do it.  Well, on that note.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I always blurt guilty out, like, within five minutes of the show where it's like, and  the husband had taken out a $2 million life insurance policy on the way. 
[01:50:00]  Guilty.  Guilty.  And it is always him.  Right.  It's always, whenever they mention money like that, it's always like, well, we know exactly.  He's got an alibi.  But they do get a hold of a lot of family photos.  Yeah.  For the camera slowly going by and then going.  Well, the Ken Burns effect.  Out of focus.  They get the Ken Burns effect working on that one.  What a genius he is to figure that out with photographs.  Well, the whole thing with the Civil War one was amazing because there's no video from the  Civil War. 
[01:50:30]  And he used photographs and actually had dynamic and movement to them and stuff.  And is as engaging.  Yeah.  As a CGI movie that costs $200 million.  Yeah.  And it's eight hours long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Civil War document.  We already did that.  We did it last week.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  Was I in it?  Was it funny?  We literally did that last week.  Was I funny?  Yes.  You were very funny.  Well, I heard some funny parts were edited out. 
[01:51:00]  No.  We put every part in.  Oh, okay.  Dispound this.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  All right.  With that, we've got to get Joel out of here.  He's a very busy man.  He is.  Community tomorrow night.  Eight o'clock.  Watch Community, yes.  What are you guys doing on the show tomorrow?  Did we even tell the people?  Just a regular audience.  All right.  Show me.  What are we going to see on Community tomorrow?  Just so we sold this properly.  I don't know, but it's going to be the best thing you've ever seen on television.  Beautiful.  Perfect.  That's it.  I should have known this.  We'll see you on Fallon tonight.  And then the suit tonight.  Fallon tonight. 
[01:51:30]  And then Kelly.  Jimmy.  I will annoy people into why.  I will not stop promoting until we are picked up for a fourth season.  Who else is on Fallon with you?  James Cameron.  Oh.  Oh.  The Oceanic Explorer guy.  That also made huge movies.  They're like, Joel, so what's going on?  Well, some uncomfortable voicemails.  We're trying to get a fourth season.  James Cameron.  I went to the Marianas Trent.  To the bottom of it.  Deepest place on earth. 
[01:52:00]  That's what I did.  Oh, and by the way, I've made the most two successful movies.  Other than that, I'm building a spaceship.  But let's talk to this overachiever over here.  Joel McKeown.  Richard Branson came on the suit one time.  There's another one.  Yeah, and we were, I was, we're a small talk while we were shooting our sketch.  Like we were like, we're in between shots.  I'm like, so, uh, what, uh, what's, what are you up to these days?  And he literally, and I had to give him credit.  He was like, well, we're, um, we're just focusing on the spaceship right now. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, right, the spaceship.  Right.  So you're building a spaceship where passengers will go into space.  Right.  Yeah.  And I was like, boy, anyway, I have a lot of clutter in my garage.  What would you do about it?  I just can't get rid of stuff.  I did a dynamite dick innuendo joke on the soup.  I nailed that.  They didn't even believe it.  Spaceship, huh?  That's one.  Yeah.  And he literally, and I was like, what?  And then I was like, so how are you?  I'm thinking I should build a spaceship. 
[01:53:00]  Uh, other people are doing it.  Why don't we do it on community?  Well, do community in space.  We did on community in space.  Oh, they did.  God damn it.  I can't get anything right.  We did the, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken Space Bus.  And I'm not joking.  Where we were trapped on a bus that was from the 70s that was pretending to go into space.  That was what used to happen with all the, uh, like, cartoons and shows in the 70s.  They would end up in space.  See, that's a lot of cartoons.  I think it was Josie and the Pussycats in outer space.  Yep.  Jabberjaw.  Jabberjaw in outer space. 
[01:53:30]  Scooby-Doo, I think, might have had a space episode later on.  Greybape.  Greybape in space.  In space.  Yeah.  Those cartoonists are taking a lot of drugs.  Yeah.  Roland, he has to go?  Why are you staring at me?  Oh, Roland.  Oh, yeah, I should.  Yeah, I have to go.  I have to take the soup.  Yes.  Find your green screen.  You get the hell out of here.  You guys, thank you.  Now, you guys do it more than anybody, but thank you for supporting the community, and  thanks for supporting the soup.  Absolutely.  I really, truly appreciate it.  You guys are great when you come on the show, too.  Yeah, you guys are great.  Tell Gillian we said hi.  Believe me.  We miss her. 
[01:54:00]  She's quite a looker, and she's very sweet.  She's such, it doesn't make sense for someone to be so cool.  I know.  She's really like a cool girl.  Yeah.  She's like one of those cool, cool girls.  Never see that when they're, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they're successful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They usually turn into, you know.  Well, it turns into, like, what's happening to Jim.  He's just so good-looking.  Exactly.  Jimmy does all right for himself.  I bet he does.  Especially with a guy who's got a roll of toilet paper sitting in front of him at all 
[01:54:30]  times.  Man, I don't want to go to the bathroom.  Long trip.  I find that I just pay for sex that works out better.  Yeah, is that better that way?  Yeah, I find that's the better way to do it.  That's good.  Oh.  See?  Some people, whatever works.  You're right.  There's something for everyone.  Yes.  All right.  T-Rock, play Joel's music, please.  Show me, show me, show me.  We've got to get out of here.  Joel McHale.  Thank you, guys.  Joel, thanks for coming.  It's Jimmy Chase.  Have a good rest of the day.  You're keeping soup?  Can I come on?  You already have, like, five times. 
[01:55:00]  Ah, shit.  What a bit sucks.  Come on next week, Jimmy.  I'm really honking on this, because once you leave, I can't do this anymore.  You can.  You can.  I will be listening in the air.  All right.  Joel McHale, everyone.  Turn up the music, taking a break.  We'll be back.  Oh, Lordy, Lord, be desperate.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Show me, show me, show me, show me how you do that trick. 
[01:55:30]  The woman makes me scream, she said, the woman makes me laugh, she said, threw her arms around my neck.  Show me how you do it, and I promise you, I promise that I'll run away with you, I'll run away with you. 
[01:56:00]  I'll be right back.  He's been all right.  He's been all right, Tuesday, and she's young.  He's been all right.  He's been all right. 
[01:56:30]  This is the end of this amazing history, dreaming of all the different ways I had to make her grow.  Why are you so far away? She said, but won't you ever know that I'm in love with you, that I'm in love with you.  Beautiful, soft and lonely, beautiful, lost and lonely, beautiful, stranger's engine, stancing in deep explosions, just a little water, you're just like a dream, just like a dream. 
[01:57:00]  The day I've made it into shape, I've still been asleep for days, and even less to breathe away, I opened up my hands. 
[01:57:30]  I found myself alone, alone, alone, above the raging sea, stoned on the glove I'm on, drowning in deep explosions, out of pain. 
[01:58:00]  You and me, soft and lonely, beautiful, lost and lonely, beautiful, dressed like heaven.  The Opie and Anthony Show, Sirius XM.  Sirius XM, XM.  This, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Hello.  Up Comedy Club in Chicago, Friday through Sunday. 
[01:58:30]  That's this Friday through Sunday, upcomedyclub.com, or at Robert Kelly on the old Twitter for info on the show.  Brand new comedy club.  Right.  Brand fucking new.  Really?  In Chicago?  In Chicago downtown, though.  It's brand new, so it's going to be cool.  And Bobby called me yesterday while I was in the middle of a screening that I was forced to go to with Roland.  Oh, boy.  Those are a treat.  What was it?  And Bob Kelly gets mad because he can't leave a voicemail when he calls me. 
[01:59:00]  I just don't understand with the technology that we have today that you can literally, I know how fun, you know when, it's too easy to know when somebody's not picking up or blowing you off.  Back in the day, you didn't know if they were home or not.  You call their house, ah, he's not home.  That's true.  You're right.  I know that the phone rings.  And I know how addictive people are.  You look at your phone every five seconds.  So I know that you looked at it and went, nope.  Because, first of all, the phone works like this.  If it goes right to voicemail, the phone's off. 
[01:59:30]  I get it.  If it rings more than fucking five times, you looked at my name and you said, nope.  And you put your little fucking shit blackberry back in your pocket.  And that was hilarious.  Then he texts me.  That's your fucking phone.  And then he goes, I can't leave a voicemail.  And then I had to write him back.  I don't have my voicemail set up because it goes back many years.  My mom used to leave horrendous, horrible messages on all our phones. 
[02:00:00]  Jesus.  I don't allow her to do that anymore.  So I don't have a voicemail for anyone.  That is fucking.  That's not.  Like twisted, fucked up voicemails.  No.  And she hasn't been able to do that in about three years now.  Too bad you didn't say them and transcribe them in a book.  You know how great that would be?  Oh, my God.  Well, I finally told her that I'm taping her all the time.  So now she behaves when she does get me live.  It's.  Well, you have to tell your mom.  She's paranoid about being recorded.  I don't like the.  So now I go, I just want to let you know I am recording this phone. 
[02:00:30]  How long do you have to treat your mom like you're a KGB spy?  Everything's being recorded.  I just want to let you know that this is phone calls being recorded.  Go.  She's got some issues.  I mean, you know.  What can I tell you?  What?  What are you?  What are you?  Mom.  Everybody's mom is a fucking loon.  My mom's on Percocets and fucking Vicodin.  No, she's just disappointed.  That's just me, Jim.  I don't mean it.  But, I mean, the fact is you don't need. 
[02:01:00]  Stop it.  You don't need a voicemail because then you could text what you were calling about.  And then I got right there.  I don't fucking text.  I'm not a 12-year-old girl.  I don't like voicemail guys.  No, I'm actually a fucking guy guy that would like to talk to my friends.  I don't like texting.  I don't like.  Because if I say something to you and then you respond, then I got to fucking say something back.  Right.  And you can't get tone.  They don't get tone in text.  And it just goes on and on.  That's why you put a smiley face.  Go fuck yourself means go fuck yourself.  It doesn't matter.  When I say suck my cock and I put a smiley face, it means I'm kidding. 
[02:01:30]  If it's a wink, it means I really would like you to suck my cock.  And Roland got me bad because he kept insisting that I go see this screening because we've  got Jason Segel coming in next week, who's a friend of the show, and I like him a lot.  And he's a big movie star.  And so I finally gave in and go, all right, I'll meet you at the theater.  And I'm sitting there.  That's when you called.  And then all of a sudden I'm getting this vibe like, wait a minute, is this a fucking chick flick?  So I said it out loud, and everyone around me went, yes.  And then Roland starts laughing like a schoolgirl and then goes, I got you. 
[02:02:00]  I got you.  Like, I guess I don't have to see this movie to have Jason Segel in here.  He just wanted to fuck me over yesterday.  So I sat through a rom-com.  What was the name of it?  Five-year engagement.  I know.  How do you not know?  It's either about Vietnam or Vietnam.  You're so right.  Or Death and Storm.  You're so right.  Oh, shit.  And it goes, the trailer looked like it was a chick flick, but I didn't even see the trailer.  The movie was very good. 
[02:02:30]  Emily Blunt is very good to look at.  Is that upside down mouth?  Who's upside down mouth?  The English broad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Emily Blunt?  Yeah, it looks like it's upside down.  Really?  Yeah, she has upside down mouth.  I'm trying to figure out what that is.  That's because she says things right to the point.  Her mouth looks like it's upside down.  What, the upper lip is thicker than the lower lip?  Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's weird.  See, it looks like it's upside down.  That's weird.  Where is she? 
[02:03:00]  She's to the point.  There's something up with her.  See, it's upside down.  She's pretty, though.  Upside down mouth.  You want to go through the trailer real fast?  You don't like her?  Well, I'll do that in a second.  I'll fuck her.  All right, let's go through the trailer.  I'll fuck her right in the pussy.  This is the movie I saw yesterday with Roland.  Where is Roland?  I'll fuck her good.  I don't know.  Oh, let's get them to do a little music.  I love you.  Aw, will you marry me?  Aw.  She said I love you, boy.  I love you so.  Oh, boy.  Oh, let's get up, baby.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  This engagement party is a moment to celebrate a new future, but not without first exploring 
[02:03:30]  a past.  Um.  I think that's enough, right?  Pause.  Paul, that's why trailers suck.  Do you even know what that meant?  Yes.  Can you put, can you?  You did?  Yeah.  I was assuming that he'd been out with some girls and, and, uh, you know, and her, he  keeps like going back to her. 
[02:04:00]  No.  Like boyfriend and girlfriend?  Well, it was all his past, uh, girlfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he brings it up at the engagement party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Best band.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Well, there was a slug line there that they just decided to cut out.  Oh, really?  The hook.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  The hook.  Were you chatting?  The hook.  I love that you turned into a mafia guy.  The hook.  The hook.  The hook.  I got a job for two years.  Two years is nothing.  Really?  And we'll start planning the wedding again from there.  Babe.  We both know I deserve to get super laid for this. 
[02:04:30]  Do you want me to wear a cape or something?  I want the show.  You never slept as a lady.  Super.  Jimmy's disgusted.  Could you replay that line again?  Why are you disgusted?  I'm not.  That's a good line.  God.  Really?  We'll start planning the wedding again from there.  We both know I deserve to get super laid for this. 
[02:05:00]  Do you want me to wear a cape or something?  Jimmy.  Jimmy's loving this trailer.  Super laid.  Okay, if I get it.  Jimmy's biting his own teeth.  Oh, boy.  His upside down mouth.  Look, man.  Jason's coming in next week.  I like Jason.  The movie wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  It's her upside down mouth. 
[02:05:30]  I didn't mean to stick that yet.  That's great.  Why don't you stop being judgmental?  Get out of here.  Get away from me.  Stop being judgmental.  Come on.  Judgmental.  Shut up, Robert.  Oh, he's very touchy.  Ew.  Shut up, Robert.  Touching you.  I just hate this fight.  What is Edgar?  Edgar stinks.  I hate Edgar.  Shut up.  Not to be confused with Eugene.  I hope somebody pours water over his face so he can talk regular. 
[02:06:00]  Shut up.  All right, let's go back to the trailer so Tranny can laugh.  That's actually Jim in around 30 years.  Sure, sure.  I like Tranny Car.  Quiet.  I can't fit it in my mouth anymore, but I used to put it in.  Let me tell you about the old days.  I just eat dried ham now.  I have a one-bedroom apartment.  I lost all my money.  Oh, shit.  Oh, now he's been off the air for 20 years. 
[02:06:30]  He's not conjuring up a nice picture.  I haven't had a gig since.  Ew.  Shut up.  I tried to get on the You Know What Dude podcast, but it didn't work out.  Oh, look at his mouth.  Ah, his mouth stinks.  Yeah.  Ew.  That's terrible.  He has no upper lip.  Shut up.  What'd you call him the other night?  A fucking beakless bird face?  That was fucking funny. 
[02:07:00]  Let's get back to the laughs of this trailer.  Sure.  Laughs will abound.  Go back to Upside Down Mouth.  We both know I deserve to get super laid for this.  Do you want me to wear a cape or something?  I want...  We gotta get past that part of the trailer.  That's good.  That's good, though.  Funny.  Roland, you tricked me last night.  Why'd you trick me?  No, I said, do you want to see the Jason Segel movie? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, but I didn't know it was a rom-com.  I know.  That bitch next to me blew up my spot.  Yeah, but then you laughed hysterically.  Because it was funny.  She was talking about an Al-Qaeda.  No, she said I'm a big fan of the show.  And then she asked, what are you doing here?  Like, literally, he would have blown him up, you know, killed him.  Why'd you want his dog killed?  See his spot?  Build-a-bomb.  Great.  What was the movie about, Roland?  I love when you describe movies.  Jason Segel and Emily Blunt, they get engaged. 
[02:08:00]  And then five years pass and different things happen in their lives.  Ups and downs.  Ups and downs.  Ups and downs.  And then Jason, you see his butt cheeks a few times, and we giggle.  Oh, well.  And then...  Sexy.  Then there's a surprise twist at the end.  Really?  It's actually a drama.  Yeah, there you go.  There's a rape. 
[02:08:30]  There's been a rape up there.  And...  And it's a good movie.  My heart hurts.  I know, it's just...  It's a chore.  While we're off the bacon.  Did you hear...  I was going through...  It was way too easy.  I apologize.  I was going through On Demand, and I saw The Gridiron Gang.  Yeah.  Remember that one, when it was like, gridiron gang.  Oh, right, right, right.  Gridiron Gang.  Right.  Wasn't that the movie that was opening Friday wide?  No, that was Edward Norton's.  It was?  It was Friday wide. 
[02:09:00]  Friday wide.  I was going through On Demand, and I saw The Rock.  Friday wide.  Oh.  What was your favorite scene in the movie last night?  Um...  Gridiron Gang.  Gridiron Gang.  Slept in chair.  No, no, no.  I was awake.  Probably when he's going through...  When they separate, and then he grows a weird beard and a mustache.  Wait.  They separate, and then I bet they get back together, though.  Wow.  No spoilers.  Oh, God.  Romantic comedies are every...  It's the same fucking movie. 
[02:09:30]  Every comedy has the same six people comics in it, though.  Yeah.  I mean, every comedy out there is the same fucking...  Kevin Hart was in this one.  Huh?  Kevin Hart.  Fucking...  What's his...  It's like the same six people.  That's it.  That's the only fucking comedic actors that are out there right now.  Yeah, yeah.  There's nobody else.  Kevin Hart was in this movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's one of them.  He's one of them.  He's one of them.  He's the black guy.  Yeah.  Little Kev is the black, white guy that they can jam in.  Yeah.  It's Little Kev.  It's fucking Jonah Hill.  It's the other guy with a beard. 
[02:10:00]  The other guy that can grow a beard.  The other guy with another beard.  And the other guy with curly hair.  It's the same fucking six people.  I mean, they're funny, yeah, motherfuckers, but there's nobody else in it.  This guy's in every fucking comedy out there.  Well, the guy who plays his friend from Parks and Rec, he was really funny.  His best friend.  Yeah, I thought he was pretty funny.  Same guys.  Let's go back to the trailer.  I want Norton to be a fucking movie star.  Well, Norton wants to be a movie star, right, Norton?  Yeah.  Of course.  But you don't want to compromise.  Well, he's not going to compromise. 
[02:10:30]  I don't have the ability.  Let's try that line.  Oh, is Bobby doing his jealous comic character?  Oh, boy.  No, he's doing his...  Oh, boy.  Catching some shit here, Bobby.  Catching some shit, Bobby.  I love that you guys are sitting there trying to light the fire.  Get those embers going.  Burn it.  Let's try the scene.  Tell him about embers.  I'll say this.  I'll say this.  I should get super laid for this.  Oh, okay. 
[02:11:00]  Play act.  You'll take the soup.  See?  He's a funnier guy.  That's great.  He just improv'd on the fly.  I loved it.  Let's go back to the trailer because there's some more fun.  Fun to be had here.  Oh, well.  Let's hear it.  Both know I deserve to get super laid for this.  Do you want me to wear a cape or something?  Jimmy would try to get Jimmy under the trailer.  Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[02:11:30]  Super laid like she's a Superman of some sort.  Yeah, yeah, but it's super laid.  You want me to wear a cape?  That is a good one.  Oh, goodness.  Watch out.  Jimmy's going to rub his arm on you.  He's in that mood.  Oh.  Oh.  I guess I'll have the soup.  You'll have the soup.  Oh, look at these.  Crackers.  Crackers.  You want cracker?  Crackers?  No.  Oh, shit.  Oh, what happened, Jimmy?  Uh-huh. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  How about we don't move the trailer backwards?  Okay.  Bring up with what?  What?  Because people might miss the line is the only thing.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  So we should go back a little bit?  Jim talked over it a little bit.  No disrespect.  All right.  Fair enough.  A little bit.  All right.  Let's go backwards a little bit.  All right.  We both know I deserve to get super laid for this.  Do you want me to wear a cape?  Oh, shit.  Crackers just flew out of his mouth.  All over Bobby.  He had a mouth full of crackers. 
[02:12:30]  They flew out all over Bobby.  You should have saw the look on his face.  He couldn't wait to do that.  What a sick fucking cracker's in him.  The smile, though, before he did it.  Oh, fuck.  Jimmy, Jesus.  All right.  I think we get the point.  Maybe we should start the trailer right here.  Okay.  You sure?  I need something to do.  Oh, no.  Why would you eat the crackers?  You shouldn't eat crackers.  You can't eat crackers.  I love crackers.  Do you have a dry mouth?  You love crackers? 
[02:13:00]  Yes, I do.  Oh, they're all crumbs around your mouth.  Why can't you?  My teeth are very dry.  So why would you eat those?  You should try to swallow those.  I can't.  It's like the Simmon in Challenge.  Let's play the trail.  Yeah, great.  Good, oppie.  We both know I deserve to get super laid for this.  Do you want me to wear a cape or something?  You want to say, what are you, flying around like you're a superman or something, rescuing  everyone?  That's good, Chip. 
[02:13:30]  There's still crackers spitting out of his mouth.  Crackers all over his mouth.  Ugh.  Ugh.  All right.  All right.  Do we get the point?  Holy fuck.  Chip kills it, doesn't he?  He did kill it.  I think I kill.  I always kill.  No, no, no.  Let's do that that way.  Let's go.  You get the Cirque du Soleil of shows.  So this, and this stuff.  What the fuck was that?  How's Michigan?  Oh, it's a fire hydrant.  All in all, it's an adjustment. 
[02:14:00]  I hear some.  How do you want to do right there?  He slipped and fell.  They want to say, what are you, paralyzed or something from an accident?  What?  I don't think that's very funny.  The guy who slipped and fell.  Why is Chip, why are you moving your hips like that?  Because I'm improv-ing.  That's what he does when he improvs.  The guy fell in the snow.  We all know that.  I'd be like, what happened?  Why'd you fall in the snow for?  Or what, do you have paralyzed in like a fall or something?  I like when he emphasizes syllables.  Don't touch me, Chip.  He's doing the elbow. 
[02:14:30]  I hate the chip forearm.  Shut up.  All right, let's go.  I think we can make it to the end of this trailer.  Here's our guest list.  Like 600 people.  No.  Maybe just we don't want to get in front of this train, but.  I would say right there, I would go, yeah, because if you get in front of the train, it's  going to run right up your cunt or something.  Holy shit.  That is Jesus.  What the fuck?  That's just brutal.  Chip, I don't know.  You don't do the clapping and the guns.  It's horrible. 
[02:15:00]  That didn't merit the clapping and the guns.  You don't think so?  Yeah.  Get in front of the train.  I'd be like, what's it?  The gravy train or something?  Is a dog yelling, hi?  Oh, it's, I don't know.  I don't know.  I was this train, but.  Have you two picked a date yet?  Not yet, but within the year.  Congratulations.  I would say, yeah, I picked a date.  This cunt, I'm standing right next to.  Jesus.  All you want to do is to use nasty language.  Congratulations.  You've been promoted. 
[02:15:30]  You're going to be with us for a few more years.  Can't wait to tell Tom.  You told me that it was going to be two years.  It's sort of like when you're on a treadmill and you tell yourself, I'm going to run five  miles today, and now it's forever miles.  When was the last time you were on a treadmill?  Sorry.  I would be like, yo, I couldn't be on a treadmill because I got cancer.  Then we'll see what that fucking bitch says.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I would say I got ankle cancer, you fucking bitch. 
[02:16:00]  Dickhead.  Hey, Roland, you want to explain the apron?  Because they didn't really show it because it's PG.  That's the opposite of the ape walk.  The apron.  Ape run, right?  Ape run.  Ape walk.  Get off me, Chip.  Oh, he's massaging you with his forearm.  Roland, explain the apron.  Because he cooks in the nude.  And the apron has a naked guy in the front of it.  So it looks like he's naked. 
[02:16:30]  Why does he cook in the nude?  I don't know.  No, you see his butt cheeks.  Is that Jason Segal right there?  Yeah, we like Jason.  I like Jason a lot, but I do like that.  Yeah.  Hit me.  All right, hit it.  This is supposed to be exciting.  This is your wedding.  You only get a few of these.  Well, I wonder...  Of course, the men will wear yarmulkes.  Babe, you don't have a yarmulke.  I have a hold.  It's in my Jewish drawer.  I don't think we can figure out all of our problems before we get married.  But I promise you that I will just love you every step of the way. 
[02:17:00]  Violet!  The door opened up and hit her right in her tits.  She was running in a car door open and hit her right in her tits.  I'll bet it knocked her fucking nipples off, too.  Jesus.  Why is Chip so mean?  Chip is always mean.  What a fucking asshole.  Chip tries to be funny, but then he gets very mean, but he doesn't know his beatball, man.  Chip just got angry. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, he does.  Piece of shit, Sam.  Chip is a fucking dick.  SD, what's your hat stand for?  Sam's Dime Store or something?  No, you idiot.  Fuck you.  Wow.  Piece of shit, fuck.  You shut the fuck up.  Chip is mean.  Chip is a very mean person.  Chip gets mad because his mom used to get fucked by black guys.  Shut up.  So what?  So she didn't.  So what?  No, that's not true.  Oh. 
[02:18:00]  Poor Chip.  Yeah, poor Chip a drink.  I'm this idiot.  It's good stuff, Bob.  Angry Chip.  I hate Chip.  All right, let's go.  Let's get through this trailer, please.  Any ideas when this wedding might happen?  Grandparents do have a tendency to die.  Mom, they're all right there.  Well, for now.  I would have said, yeah, well, let me know when you die so I can save some money and you  fucking play, you old piece of shit. 
[02:18:30]  Why?  Why?  I just want to put that in a comedy show.  In a comedy show.  Yeah, when I'm talking to the old people, they're like, grandparents die.  I'd be like, well, let me know when you're going to die, you fucking old cocksucking motherfucker.  Then we'll have the wedding.  All right.  All right.  Good plan.  Whoa.  This is why we do not delay weddings.  Funeral.  The five-year engagement.  Yeah.  What a cute little flower girl you'll be. 
[02:19:00]  And poke her hands.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  What happened there?  What happened?  What happened right there?  Bow.  Arrow.  Oh, was it like a crossbow?  Yeah, crossbow.  Okay.  Wow.  Boy.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  I love the movie.  Roland loved it.  It was great.  Don't worry, Roland.  Jason will be in here.  How's that trailer I showed you?  We'll sell the movie.  Probably the one with the bear.  The Ted.  Ted.  The funniest trailer ever.  What's that about, Robert?  No.  You saw it. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, no.  The funniest trailer ever.  Ted.  What's that, Robert?  It's about a teddy bear.  Yeah.  That was okay.  What's Ted about?  You haven't seen the Ted?  That's hilarious.  No, play the, make sure you play the unrated one.  The red trailer.  Red band.  Joel McKell's in this one, too.  Is he?  See?  Oh, we just had Joel.  Oh.  Now it's Bob Kelly's turn.  Of Comedy Club in Chicago this weekend.  The Joel's in this big movie list.  Advertisement.  It's an ad.  Turn the ad off.  You gonna listen to the ad? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Have to.  Why?  I don't know.  It was cool car noises.  I thought it was all right.  I didn't mind the cool car noises.  You like that?  You like that?  Yeah.  I will.  You know how to pop lock?  Pass it over.  Take it back.  You got it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I am so sorry.  No, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  What happened?  I'm John.  I'm Laurie.  It's Marky Mark.  Sweet. 
[02:20:30]  It's a rom-com.  Sounds like a rom-com, right?  They're painting, frolicking.  I love you, too.  Mom!  I don't understand.  I really don't.  I'm 35 years old, and you're still scared of a little thunder.  I am not.  Thunder buddies for life, right, Johnny?  Fucking right.  All right, come on.  Let's sing the thunder song.  All right.  When you hear the sound of thunder, don't you get too scared. 
[02:21:00]  Just grab your thunder, buddy, and say these magic words.  Fuck you, thunder.  You can suck my dick.  You can't get that thunder, because you're just God's farts.  No shit from Family Guy.  Let me tell you about my best friend.  He's a warm-up.  It's like a little bear smoking pot with him.  Yeah, he's a teddy bear.  But he's a liar.  You don't think she's going to be expecting something big, do you?  What, like anal?  No, like a circular gold thing on the finger. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, fuck that.  It's been four years, Johnny.  You and me have been together for 27 years.  Where's my ring?  Huh?  Where's my ring, asshole?  Where's my ring, motherfucker?  Put it on my fuzzy finger, you fuck.  Come on.  All right, all right.  It's Peter Griffin.  It's my voice.  It's fucking Peter's voice.  I'm only saying this because I love you.  Baby, please ask Ted to move out so we can move on with our lives.  I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.  I've met a girl.  She's a cashier.  No way.  That's awesome. 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  All right.  So that's where we'll draw the line.  Too bad the audience can't watch this with us.  All right.  What's her name?  White trash name.  Yes.  Yeah.  Mandy.  Nope.  Marilyn.  Nope.  Brittany.  Nope.  Tiffany.  Nope.  Candace.  Nope.  Don't fuck with me on this.  I know this shit.  You see me fucking with you?  I'm going to rattle off some names.

[02:23:00]  Ted, it's almost two million views on YouTube.  It's so smart.  Because fucking faggity TV won't play stuff like that.  Oh, they won't play anything like that.  Nothing.  It's going to be funny.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's going to be funny.  All right, we should take a little break, and then we want to get into what you're wearing  there, Bobby.  After the break, though.  Yes.  What you should be wearing, which is a noose.  I just...  It's just mean.  That's very mean.  That was very chip-like.  I'm your friend.  Stop being so mean.  See, I want you to act like a friend.  What does that mean? 
[02:23:30]  What does that mean?  Fall low.  I don't even understand what you just said.  Oh, don't touch me.  Oh, he's banging into you.  I just hate him.  What were we going to say?  He's rocking back and forth and banging his hips into Bobby.  I just learned what that shirt was that you have on.  What?  That's a specific shirt.  Yeah, it's got little buttons on it and a fucking...  It's a regular shirt.  Did you wear it when you went fishing or something?  Cups to V?  What are you talking about?  No, that type of shirt.  The five-buttons shirt.  What is it called?  What's wrong with him?  It clings to that body.  It's a regular shirt.  No, it's a specific shirt that men wear. 
[02:24:00]  What is it?  I don't know.  What is he talking about?  I have no idea.  I'm just fucking with you.  Bob Kelly, Up Comedy Club in Chicago, Friday through Sunday, UpComedyClub.com.  But don't forget.  Yes, don't forget.  I'll be in D.C. tomorrow, Friday and Saturday.  I hate him.  I hate him.  But Friday and Saturday are, for all intents and purposes, sold out.  So only tomorrow's available.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  He was like, Sirius XM.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  This is The Opinion Anthony Show.  Hanging with Bob Kelly today.  Up Comedy Club in Chicago, Friday through Sunday, UpComedyClub.com.  Get your tickets now, Chicago.  Please.  Hey, Bobby, what are you wearing, man?  I'm late to the party on this new gadget you got.  It's called the bandolier.  This is something that Bobby has.  No.  This is something that, you know how Bobby, over the years, has brought things to the 
[02:25:00]  show and we've laughed at them.  Yeah, like the iPad.  And later they have...  Yeah, I'm not even going to...  I'm not going to...  Wow, we've got to find that audio.  Fucking idiots.  Yeah, well, you need an iPad for.  You got your phone.  I got the phone.  It's between the computer and the audio.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right about the iPad.  No, I've been right about everything.  I'll give you that.  You're right.  But...  Kick-ass the movie?  Kick-ass the movie.  He came with that.  He was fucked that movie.  I understand.  Okay.  But this bandolier thing that you have is not going to take off, Bobby. 
[02:25:30]  It's going to take off.  Absolutely.  What Bobby has on him is what amounts to...  Let's say you're carrying a bag, like a computer bag or something.  Golf bag, actually.  Golf bag, right.  Great golf bag.  And you have the strap that goes around your shoulder and then down your back.  And the bag hangs on your side.  It's that without the bag.  It's just the strap.  And on the strap are various pouches and pockets and Velcro things. 
[02:26:00]  What is he doing?  Where he puts his phone and his wallet and pens and water.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  And...  Hold on.  But it's just the strap.  So it's on him like a bandolier.  If you remember, like in the old movies, you'd see guys carrying ammunition in their bandolier.  So it's a bandolier.  Yeah.  Or a Girl Scout sash. 
[02:26:30]  So what's the purpose of the bandolier?  Well, okay.  You have a backpack, right?  Yeah.  Okay, it's fucking cumbersome.  Yeah.  It's a lot of fucking shit.  Sometimes you don't need all that space.  Isn't that what you wear from prom?  No, that's a cummerbund.  That's a cummerbund.  Why did he say it as Norton, though?  He didn't even say it as Chip.  He's getting lazy.  You fucked up, you fucking silly douche.  No, he really wanted to make it hurt.  He didn't fuck up.  Yeah, it...  Yeah, it's a shoulder holster utility pack.  You got...  Right here, look.  You can put all your credit cards, some note stuff. 
[02:27:00]  This is classic Bobby, too, by the way.  Right here.  Dude, you can put your credit card...  Yeah, boom, you note stuff.  What note stuff?  You know what you should do?  What's that?  Wait, what's up?  We goof on Bob about right now.  You should have Norton do me with the thing.  Oh, describing it.  I call you.  All right.  All right.  Let's get this here.  Hold on.  So Norton's going to explain the bandolier.  Jimmy's explaining it here.  I got it.  Doing the Bob Kelly impression.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  You just gotta, boom, you put on your...  ...and your bandolier, dude.  Because a lot of times you got these inconveniences. 
[02:27:30]  What are these little holes in the pants for?  Pockets.  Oh, pockets.  Yeah, you do.  You put, like, a piece of paper in there.  There's no more room, dude.  So you wear this.  It's like a Girl Scout thing.  Look, dude, boom, you got your water.  So you're walking along.  Hey, I've gone four feet.  I'm thirsty, dude.  Boom.  Take a sip of water.  You got your phone right here.  Like, you gotta call somebody.  Hey, boom, I'm gonna be late, dude.  I'll be right there.  Boom.  Look at this you got right here.  You got your iPad.  Boom.  Dude, you pop that in.  You listen.  Look at these things with cobwebs on them. 
[02:28:00]  Pens?  Yeah.  You're implying he doesn't write.  Oh, is that right there?  I didn't know what these were, dude.  I was just stabbing people with them.  Hey, look at this, dude.  You just spin it around.  Because it saves you a lot of trouble.  This way you don't have to actually go into your...  What are these?  Oh, pockets.  Oh, yeah, your pockets, dude.  You just put it right here.  This way you don't have to notice that you're slowly killing yourself.  All right.  Oh, look at this.  You turn it the wrong way.  Your water turns upside down, dude.  It spills right on.  Ruins your phone.  So basically, this thing's gonna do about $2,000 worth of damage, dude. 
[02:28:30]  Boom.  Boom.  You got your thing for your notes.  You want to write a note to yourself?  Boom.  Remember to photograph feet later so you can see them.  Boom.  You know, dude.  Dude, you got your knife and fork just in case the friction burnt out the other ones.  Yeah, dude, you got your knife, your fork, you got your straw.  Dude, boom.  Look at this.  You can fold up a little tablecloth.  Boom.  Dude, you have a picnic.  You sit in the park.  Boom.  Dude, you do your podcast.  Boom.  Dude, you go to Chicago.  You put your ID in here.  You put your credit cards in there. 
[02:29:00]  Boom.  You take a note.  Dude.  Boom.  You don't just take it off on the plane, right?  And put it right in the...  Right in the...  When you travel, it's fucking the best.  Boom.  Dude, you go through security.  You take your shoes off.  You ask someone to put them up on the belt for you.  You take this off.  Boom.  You throw it right on the belt.  You save time.  Unless you're going for the x-ray picture.  And then they got to have three guys push you all the way through it.  Then you lose that time, dude.  Oh, please.  That you just gained.  Bobby, run through it really fast from top to bottom. 
[02:29:30]  The bandolier.  Oh, you got to erase that.  There you go.  Ready?  First, you got your ID.  So when you're traveling, you keep your fucking ID up top.  So it's a little Velcro pouch thing that opens and it's got a clear plastic thing.  It's like a hunting license.  There you go.  Then you got your wallet.  A zipper pouch.  Basically, another little pouch.  You can put some credit cards, some other information.  Maybe your boarding pass right up front.  You keep it nice and neat.  The traveler's companion.  You got a couple pens.  Sometimes you sign an autograph.  You keep a Sharpie around.  Oh, he's got a Sharpie and a pen.  Then you got a nice pen, right? 
[02:30:00]  You got to sign.  Sometimes you're traveling abroad.  You got to sign that fucking document.  What if you're traveling by yourself, you cock-sucking motherfucker?  I love Mean Chip.  I actually like Mean Chip.  All right, moving down the bandolier.  Then you got your phone right here.  Your phone right there.  Then you got your wallet right here.  Crackers in there.  And then you...  Crackers, Edgar.  Please.  You got your keys down the bottom.  Right.  Right?  You got a little fucking hooky for your keys.  You got your water.  But not only just one.  You got two.  You can put a couple things in here.  Two waters?  Well, you can put a water and some other stuff in here.  Let me see.  You almost saw me on the bandolier. 
[02:30:30]  Hold on.  Put my camera in there.  Yeah, you can put your camera in here.  Don't do it.  Don't just talk about it.  I'm going to put your camera right in here.  Boom.  That's actually...  You know what?  Oh, shit.  Boom!  Norton.  Oh, shit.  That's actually pretty fucking cool.  Oh, man.  Jimmy's getting sold on the bandolier.  Oh, shit.  Then right here, though, is actually cool because you can keep, you know, whatever, gum and  all your shit in here.  Right.  On the other...  Just say other stuff.  Another pocket.  But isn't that weird when you're hanging up...  When you're hanging up...  ...sunglasses right here.  How come no light comes off the bandolier? 
[02:31:00]  Keep your sunglasses right here.  It's like a sandalier.  And then on the inside...  Right here.  But you can't get past the...  Huh?  I can't get past the part you...  I hate the cutie.  I adore you wearing it.  On the other side, you got another secret pocket on the inside.  Yeah, but you look dumb.  Oh, man.  You look dumb.  And they got different colors.  This is actually...  It's called a runner.  It's R-U-N-N-U-R.  R-U-N-N-U-R.  R-U-N...  Yeah.  It's good.  I use this when I walk on the West Side Highway.  I carry this.  Yeah?  Yeah, because you want to fucking go to lunch. 
[02:31:30]  Boom.  You got credit cards.  You want to use your phone?  Bang.  You need a key?  Boom.  You put it in the lock.  Boom.  The door's open.  Shut up.  Well, my sister's saying, how is this not a purse?  It is.  It's an upgraded fanny bag.  Yeah, it's an upgraded fanny bag.  Right, right.  This is actually a cool fanny bag.  And when you travel, like if you're in the airport...  Not cool.  Boom.  Convenient stuff.  I might actually...  That actually is fucking cool for the...  Because I always have my camera.  I can go like...  I'm spinning around.  Hello, celebrity. 
[02:32:00]  I guarantee.  If the company sent everybody here one of these, I guarantee secretly one of you douches  would be caught wearing it at a fucking renaissance fair.  I would use it.  You spin it around.  I've got to get you a while.  Isn't it easy to steal all your stuff at once, though?  Oh, man.  What are you talking about?  Yo, fat boy, give me the vandalier from here.  You pull that strap over your head and start running.  No, they actually think you're a cop when you have this on.  No, they don't, Bobby.  I just made that up.  Oh, okay.  Fuck. 
[02:32:30]  I think you're a cop.  You want some questions about the vandalier?  Oh.  I don't want anything from your fans.  Yeah, right.  No, they're nice.  Let's go to Charlie in Santa Cruz.  Charlie?  Put my headphones on.  I can't hear.  All right, go ahead, Charlie.  What's going on?  Bobby, is that being elastic for your gut?  Oh, man.  See, I didn't know what he was going to say.  Come on, man.  Yeah, you did.  It says it right next to his name what he's going to say.  No, I didn't really know.  They screened the call, Opie.  No, I didn't know.  No, they say it.  Oh, Lord.  Have mercy.  I'm sorry.  And I love it that that guy's probably fatter than me. 
[02:33:00]  Probably.  Good luck.  Get out of here.  Jeez, Jeff.  All right.  Let's try another one.  Jack in Indiana.  Jack.  Hey, slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  You're too excited.  Slow down.  I know you think you got a good one, but make it count.  Go ahead.  Is that a cheap Batman utility belt knockoff and you just couldn't get around your waist?  Too wordy, dude.  Too wordy.  Oh, man.  It was a good one, but it was too wordy.  Let me tell you also, Bobby is brilliant. 
[02:33:30]  You completely defused this motherfucker before he said anything.  Shut up.  Fucking stupid dog from the Flintstones.  Shut up.  It is like a Batman utility belt.  Yeah.  You got your bat signal in here.  Boom.  Boom.  You got your little bat that hooks into the building.  You climb the building.  You got your suction cup on your feet.  As far as New York City, you're traveling.  Fucking greatest thing I've ever had.  It looks kind of goofy.  It's fucking.  It looks goofy, though.  It's weird.  It's fucking great.  You'll get used to it.  Everybody will have these in around fucking next weekend. 
[02:34:00]  It really is easy for people to rob everything.  Give me that.  And they just take it off.  That's called the fucking wallet and a phone.  They can do that.  No, your wallet.  You got it.  You got it.  So what you're saying is a guy who comes to rob you, he's going to go, give me your phone  and your wallet.  No, they're going to go, give me your shit.  And he's going to take it.  But they'll take your wallet and be happy enough.  Yeah, but if they take your wallet, put it this way.  If somebody's got to take your wallet, they go like, all right, take my wallet.  Say, give me your wallet, motherfucker.  Yeah, but you don't know.  I have a secret thing in here for a knife.  Go ahead.  Say, take it.  And I go, oh, yeah, here.  And I fucking slice you with the bandolier knife. 
[02:34:30]  Attachment.  Yeah, the attachment I bought.  It's the bandolier knife attachment.  See, but if I have to go for my wallet, I go like this.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And, oh.  Hey, Bobby, we want you to look at this video.  Can we go to another one of those brilliant callers?  Yeah, we can.  No.  Bobby.  They're fucking hilarious.  Bobby, look at this video.  Oh, what is that?  It's just a guy.  That's a grappling hook.  Oh, I don't want to throw up, dude.  You won't throw up.  This is an easy one.  You can get through this one.  This is from. 
[02:35:00]  You said that during two girls, one cup.  But this is easy.  What is that?  What is it?  Coming out of his nose.  It's boogers.  Yeah, dude, I used to eat boogers.  That doesn't affect me.  That's like an oyster, though.  Yeah, but, dude, I used to.  Did you see that?  I have a photo of me sucking my fingers in a hammock my aunt just sent me yesterday.  I used to suck my fingers and pick my nose and roll it on my upper lip and put it in  my mouth and try to make the perfect round booger.  Why would you roll it on your lip?  Holy fuck.  Yeah, dude.  Stop that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Is it grossing you out?  I hate fucking snot.  Is this whole thing backfiring?  Are you fucking creeps? 
[02:35:30]  What did I do?  I never watched that clip.  What did you do?  That's the problem with you, Anthony.  Hang on one second.  I'm the world's strongest hemorrhage.  Hang on, bird mouth.  You make fucking mean things, but then you do a cute face.  You do what I do to my wife when I say, hey, fucking get the way out of the TV.  What'd you say to me?  And I make a cute face.  She goes, ah, you do the same shit to me.  You'll see a nice fat joke.  That's the same thing you're wearing.  We gotcha.  What is that? 
[02:36:00]  A prolapsed anus.  Oh, my God.  That's disgusting.  A prolapsed anus will get me every fucking day of the week.  It certainly will.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Ah, fuck.  That's not real.  That's not real.  That's something...  Oh, my God.  Bobby.  What the fuck?  It's a red prolapsed asshole.  Why would you...  But some girls actually like that.  Like, it's a gift, right?  What?  Go back to that one, Sam.  That's weird.  That's just weird.  Is your asshole that red on the inside?  No, the other one.  Is it really that red on the inside? 
[02:36:30]  I guess.  No.  Not mine.  No.  Mine has fucking cookies and cream ice cream on the inside.  Go up a little bit.  That's what mine looks like.  Go to that one.  What the fuck is that?  This is weird.  This is not real.  Oh, fuck, man.  God damn it.  It's hairy.  Imagine smelling that.  No.  That doesn't gross you out?  Just the boogers?  He's not looking.  I did see that one.  That one's fucking terrible.  Holy shit.  Really?  Jim pays extra for that. 
[02:37:00]  You sure you can pull up your abs?  It looks like one of those carved rose radishes coming out of his ass.  It's horrible.  He's got fucking...  Yeah, boogers don't fuck with me.  Yeah, boogers was easy.  When I was like nine, that would have been the shit.  Oh, my God.  It went away.  Oh, you dummy.  It's not there anymore.  Ha ha, you didn't get me.  Oh, that's terrible.  Bobby, can you just...  What is it? 
[02:37:30]  I'll see the shit.  Make it big screen.  Make it big screen.  Oh, no, Bobby.  Bobby, you all right?  It's just from ass fucking.  Look at the other thing.  That looks like oatmeal on his dick.  Yeah, I don't...  That's rough.  That's rough, man.  Oh, my God.  That's rough.  Yeah, I'm done with that.  Hey, man, you were cocky.  No, I was cocky, right?  You challenged us.  That's just ass fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like that.  That's not...  That's not real.  That's terrible.  All right, we went back to the snot. 
[02:38:00]  That's...  What is that?  That's poop.  What's that, though?  That's called poop.  There's something green right there.  Yeah, that's...  That's just watery poop.  It's watery poop.  It's watery poop.  It's watery poop.  It's watery poop.  It's watery poop.  It's watery poop.  Why would you challenge us?  You're on the top left.  Yeah, I'm done.  Why would you challenge us?  No, I didn't eat...  All right, I'm done.  That's easy.  That's a good one.  That's just comedy.  Just look at that one.  That's funny.  That's all I can love.  It's just comedy.  It's funny.  Bobby, it's funny. 
[02:38:30]  Anthony, your dumb cute face isn't going to work this time, stupid.  Hey, dude, Bobby, come here.  It's funny.  Look, we're laughing.  Bouncy-wouncy.  It's kind of funny.  It's funny.  Come on.  It is kind of funny.  Just look.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on one second.  All right.  All right.  No look.  Hang on.  Just give me a second.  All right.  I'll literally...  No, this one's fun.  I'll pass out with this shit.  What did you say?  Shut up for no reason?  You are just a miserable old cunt, Jim.  You just said shut up out of the blue.  Like, he just...  In his brain all the time, unless it's him talking, he's shut up. 
[02:39:00]  Shut up.  I just want to hear me.  What is that?  Hang on.  Bobby, go ahead.  This one's fun.  This one's fun for everyone.  You know what I need to do in here?  I need to puke on one of you so you'll never want this again.  Never do it again.  You'll never do it again.  Go ahead, Bobby.  Don't puke on your bandolier.  Hang on.  You're a runner.  Yeah, I'm not showing you these.  No, this is fun.  Hang on.  This one's fun.  He backed out on that one.  I'm not doing anything.  Yeah, I'm not showing you.  Hang on.  Hang on.  That is a good one, though.  No, don't bug me.  It's funny, right?  Don't bug me because it's not... 
[02:39:30]  He's, like, blocking the actual...  The bum.  You know what I mean?  That one bothers you, though.  He's running.  He's running at Sam.  He's trying to puke on Sam.  He's all over Sam.  He's throwing up on Sam.  Oh, he's ass-raping him, too.  Bobby would be a great prison rapist.  Oh, I would be.  Just pin the kid in the corner.  Sure.  I'd be the...  Yeah, I'd just pin...  Oh, what about that one?  I'd be the placeholder in prison.  Fourth one.  No, the one to the left of that.  I wouldn't be the leader. 
[02:40:00]  I'd just be, like, I'd be holding the guy.  Yeah.  I'd be going, it's okay.  It's okay.  Just take it.  Bobby, is that easy?  That's easy, right?  All right.  All right, Opie.  I'm fucking done with this shit.  Move on.  That's easy, right?  Yeah, I'm done.  All right.  I'm done.  You're good.  We're good now?  Yeah, we're good.  Yeah.  You'd be like Mr. White in fucking Reservoir Dogs.  You finished?  You finished?  Not like you're begging.  You're begging.  Look, please don't.  Please.  I just don't...  You finished?  I don't get how you...  The shit thing is what bugs me.  Shit, I don't mind an operation.  How are you on this show, then?  He fucked me up. 
[02:40:30]  Shit thing is rough.  That's just rough.  I don't like...  Asshole stuff bugs me.  I think that stuff bugs me.  Again, how are you on this show?  See, because we're assholes.  Pussy shit bugs me.  You all right?  Oh, God.  Oh, thank God.  You both burpy.  Asshole.  Asshole shit's really shit, and I don't like stuff coming out of assholes.  Snot gets me.  Can't look at snot.  Snot's fine with me.  No.  That booger shit didn't bug me.  I was like, oh, that must have felt so good coming out. 
[02:41:00]  That's disgusting, too.  She's like polishing her calloused feet, and then they dump the fucking foot sawdust out  of that little egg.  I was on Cowhead, and he had this fan come in for tickets.  He had one of those, and he did that to his foot.  Oh, no.  And he's not gonna...  He doesn't have a pleasant foot.  And he took all the stuff like Parmesan cheese and put it on a taco, and the guy had to  eat it.  Jesus.  Let's get their permission to do that one. 
[02:41:30]  He took that, and it looked like Parmesan cheese, and it smelled like a good cheese.  Like Parmesan cheese.  It smelled like a good, like a heavy, heavy cheese.  Oh, fuck.  Come on.  That's disgusting.  That's wrong.  And then he...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Is this bugging you?  I apologize.  Let me make a cute face, Ant.  Come on.  No, you fucking look at it, baby.  Come on.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Bobby's turning it on us.  I don't like that.  I know.  This isn't fun at all.  Listen.  Bobby...  You want to look at maggot penis?  Is that...  No.  No.  You want to look at maggot penis for shits and giggles? 
[02:42:00]  No.  For shits and giggles?  Shits and giggles.  No.  Shits and giggles.  Shits and giggles.  Maggot penis.  What's maggot penis?  No.  I'm not looking.  I don't know what maggot penis is.  I do not look.  Look at little fingers move so quicky.  His little fingers.  Yeah, this is easy.  He can type fast, thank God, because his browsing sucks.  I don't understand this.  What is this?  It's just maggots coming out of people.  But I don't understand why.  How does it get to that point?  A rotting...  How does it get to that point?  Infection.  Oh, God.  Fuck, dude.  God. 
[02:42:30]  You ever see the video of that?  No.  I don't want to...  I saw a video of a guy laying there with maggots clawing out of his mouth.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I don't understand that.  See, that doesn't...  I don't know why that...  I mean, that's gross.  Go to the third one in, Sam.  Third one in.  What is that?  Is that a...  It's just dead?  What is that?  It's only...  I'll explain this why this doesn't fuck me up.  You know heights?  I'm afraid of heights.  I can't...  You almost said I'm scared of heights.  I'm scared of heights.  Yeah, what are you, a scaredy cat or something?  Pull me out somewhere.  Oh, God.  When you look at a plane, I don't give a fuck. 
[02:43:00]  But if I'm on top of a building, I literally panic.  Well, it's because it's not real.  It's not real.  You're on a fucking nice, comfy chair.  Don't fucking touch me.  All right?  All right.  Enough.  Would you?  Enough with your fucking fat jokes, you fucking cocksucker.  I'm sorry.  Stop it.  Stop touching me.  Sorry.  Last night, though, he tried...  Okay, Norton is a fucking difficult feat.  You'd have to say, stop touching me.  It's like a fucking child.  It's awful.  To outgay him is a fuck...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It never happens. 
[02:43:30]  Very rarely.  It's like beating him in chest.  Very rarely what you do.  Last night, he grabbed my junk.  I was at the table at the cellar, and I just reached under and cupped his fucking balls,  and he didn't flinch.  I didn't flinch.  Jimmy Norton.  But I was like, ah, it grossed me.  I had to pull my hand away.  I had nosy sweats?  I didn't wear underwear.  No, I didn't have my underwear on, though.  My balls were like that hot afternoon nut.  And so, I mean, just a...  I felt it right after he did it.  Wow.  And he had that right heavy nut right on his fingertips, and he backed out. 
[02:44:00]  I've never seen Norton give up.  I've never seen him give up.  Yeah.  And he had to do it in front of people, which hurt even more.  Yeah.  You know, there was a table full of guys, and he's holding my balls, and he had to stop  holding them.  That's...  I've never seen Norton quit.  Disgusting.  Oh, I almost cheated.  Hey, I think we've got to look at that.  I think we've got to look at the video of Sweet Brown, who eyewitnessed the fire.  Everyone's talking about this dumb video today.  Yeah.  Want to just play the video, Sam?  So we have the visual element for us in studio. 
[02:44:30]  You see this lady yet?  There was a fire.  There was a fire.  Eyewitness?  And she had some problems with the fire.  The news loves when they get an eyewitness like this.  When they get to interview eyewitnesses like this.  Oh, yeah.  There's clips galore of this same woman, pretty much.  Let's put this on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Hit that.  I got a hundred bucks, says you will.  Sounds like a white guy.  Yeah, it certainly does.  It's Arlie Ermey doing a commercial. 
[02:45:00]  You guys had him in there.  I know.  You should come back.  I like that guy.  He's a great guy.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Special invitations?  Yeah, see?  That's going to fucking go away somewhere where he can't.  His heart's going to fail because he's screaming.  I know.  Here we go.  Experience when she first realized the complex was on fire.  Well, I woke up to go get me a cold pop.  Then I thought somebody was barbecuing.  I said, oh, Lord Jesus, it's a fire.  Then I ran out.  I didn't grab no shoes or nothing, Jesus.  I ran for my life. 
[02:45:30]  And then the smoke got me.  I got bronchitis.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  That sounds like somebody, like Anthony would do a character.  That sounds like Anthony just.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that great?  I got bronchitis.  I got bronchitis.  Somebody was barbecuing.  I said, Lord Jesus.  Somebody's barbecuing and I smiled.  That's like someone from the 30s.  That's a black woman from the 30s movies. 
[02:46:00]  No one like that really exists today.  I woke up to get me.  What was it?  A pop?  A cold pop.  I woke up to get me a cold pop.  What's a cold pop?  Is that a beer?  Soda.  Or it could be anything.  I think it's cold soda.  Yeah.  Just cold soda?  On the West Coast.  It's cold pop.  Your father's dead.  That's not funny to make fun of somebody who passes away. 
[02:46:30]  You're a piece of shit.  I like Angry Chip.  You shouldn't make fun of people who pass away.  You should pay respects.  That's very good, Chip.  Shut up.  Fucking faggot, cocksucker.  I love Angry Chip.  I love Angry Chip.  He's so angry.  Angry Chip makes me happy.  Good.  What's the B on your shirt stand for or something?  Bob's Big Boy or something?  Bob's Big Boy or something.  What was that?  Clap and the Point. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, oh, no.  Don't touch me.  You don't know the Clap and the Point?  Does he touch everybody in here?  He does his guns.  Pretty much.  I hate it.  Can I hear that black lady?  You want to hear it again?  Lordy, Lord.  I got stuck.  Why is Sam taking notes?  Then I told somebody who was barbecuing.  I said, oh, Lord Jesus, it's a fire.  Fire.  Then I ran out.  I didn't grab no shoes or nothing, Jesus.  Jesus.  I ran for my life. 
[02:47:30]  And then the smoke got me.  I got bronchitis.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  She's like a female Tracy Morgan.  Yeah, they show this not like Cat Williams.  I hear a little more Tracy.  I got bronchitis.  Goddamn.  I'm on SNL.  I don't have no shoes or nothing, Jesus.  Oh, she's talking to Jesus.  Smell my finger.  She's handling it well, though.  Yes, she is.  Her house just burned down.  She is.  Very well.  Where was this?  Where was this?  A fucking gated community of mansions. 
[02:48:00]  Really?  You're being silly.  What town was it in?  It's Ville.  What town?  What?  It doesn't matter.  What state?  What city?  What city?  It could be.  What city?  You want to tell them what city it is?  Huh?  No.  Chicago.  What? 
[02:48:30]  Where was it?  Where was it?  Why are you taking notes, Sam?  The after show?  You really just care about yourself.  He takes notes.  He only cares about his show.  This show is a setup to that show.  This is just for him.  This is just a setup for your show.  This show is just for him.  Just for his little show afterwards.  What show is it again?  What's it called, Anthony? 
[02:49:00]  It's Sam's after show.  Oh, wait.  Shit show.  That's right.  Shit show.  How are you with cysts?  Like back cysts?  Oh, God.  I can't look at that either.  You want to try one of those?  What do you mean?  I can't look at that either.  Jeez, you guys really ran out of fucking material.  Opie's just going cysts.  Cyst.  You're just picking shit out of the fucking throat.  What's wrong with you?  This is like fucking...  Well, we're learning about you.  You don't like the shit, but you can do snot.  I'm wondering if you can do a cyst.  I don't know, Opie.  You want to try one?  I don't know.  You want to try one?  If you got nothing else, I guess so.  It's from Tosh. 
[02:49:30]  Tosh.  5.0.  Tosh.  Oh.  Funny guy.  Oh.  You like Tosh?  Yeah.  I like the Tosh.  Has he ever been on here?  No.  For some reason, he doesn't do our show.  Really?  We've tried.  You tried to get him on?  Yeah.  Through the fans and stuff.  Yeah.  That's always good.  Hey, you faggot.  Why aren't you on the Opie and Anthony show?  LOL.  Well, I think they've been nice.  It's gotten so popular that Tyra Banks took some time off from being untalented to discuss  it on her show.  Oof. 
[02:50:00]  Well, that inspired me to take some action.  It's about time you guys had a glimpse of all the horrible s**t we have to sift through  to find funny internet videos.  So get your barf bags ready.  Your reactions are about to be filmed, watching a segment called, Guess What Happens Next.  All right.  Here's a dude with a s**t on his back and a chick hovering over him with an X-Acto knife  and Band-Aids on her fingers.  So I assume she's a licensed dermatologist.  Can you guess what happens next? 
[02:50:30]  I can't look at this.  Oh, the screams.  Why don't we get to see?  So if you guessed she would use the knife to slice an escape route for all his shoulder  cheese, you're off to a good start.  Can you guess what happens next?  Uh-oh.  It's the worst smell I think I've ever smelled in my entire life.  Oh.  Oh!  What happened?  Oh!  What happened, Bobby?  You're reacting like the audience. 
[02:51:00]  They're not showing it.  Another tablespoon of pus.  Oh, gosh damn it.  They showed it a little bit.  I think they're rants enough to almost make her puke on his back.  Good work.  What bothers me is you know if there was a spider in the room, she would get the hell  out of there.  But somehow this is okay.  Guess what happens next?  Oh, there's still more.  There's still more.  Whoa!  Oh!  What is that?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  What was that?  That was... 
[02:51:30]  It was more.  The real thing you should be wondering is how the hell they let me put this on television.  What a great zit.  Oh!  You want to guess what happens next?  No?  Too bad.  What a great...  They keep cutting away from it.  Yeah, they keep cutting away.  What a great zit.  They're not allowed to show it.  It's fun to look at clouds and try to figure out what shapes you see in them.  Why aren't they allowed to show this on TV?  Because it's fucking too disturbing.  It's commiescentral though, isn't it?  She sees a brain.  Oh, Jesus.  Seriously?  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Why can't they show this?  Also, maybe a paper towel isn't the best thing to use here.  Can we find the original video?  What?  I'd recommend a ShamWow.  It's called Two Girls, One Sis maybe.  What a great...  What a great zit though.  Why wouldn't they show that on TV?  What a great zit.  It's exhausting not watching it.  Yeah.  I can't look at that.  It's so disgusting.  Here's the original.  Sometimes when we touch, the honesty is too much.  Here you go, Bobby.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, that don't bug me as much.  I'm blocking.  It's all I think I've ever smelled in my entire life. 
[02:52:30]  Mike flagged.  Oh.  Wow.  It got on our finger.  Oh, my God.  That's on the back of his neck, right?  Yeah.  It smells like cheese.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's smearing all over his shoulder.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This guy is just...  It's like squeezing a mayonnaise pack.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, what a zit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there's still more.  There's still more.  Women love popping.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:53:00]  What?  Oh.  How's that all in there?  You've got to work faster.  It's called two girls and one six on YouTube.  It's so funny.  Wow.  You've got to work faster.  That's pretty...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How is that all in there?  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  How much is that?  How do you describe that?  That was like a mayonnaise pack.  That was the amount of mayonnaise they put on a Chick-fil-A sandwich. 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to throw everything up.  She's still going.  You've got to get the rest of it.  You know they're going to...  Oh, man.  How would...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There's a hunk hanging out.  It's like a hunk.  I'm sitting there.  I'm sitting there.  They're talking about me.  No, they're not.  I think of this horrendous smell.  Oh, it smells?  Frank, are you okay?  Did that hurt?  I know.  Does it smell good?  It's fucking decaying organism.  Is that what it is?  It's fucking rotting. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  That's actually a fucking great one right there.  Bacteria.  You die when you see this.  Oh, my God.  It smells so bad.  It just stinks.  Oh!  I'm on the verge of nausea just listening to this.  Never mind watching it.  Isn't that being rubbed under your nose?  No.  Oh!  You know...  Oh, God.  I don't know if that's right.  Wow.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, that might be actual...  That might be not pus.  That might be, like, fat.  Like, bad.  No, it's hardened pus.  Are you sure? 
[02:54:30]  It's hardened pus.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Dude, that looked like a small white grape.  That's unbelievable how much is coming out of this.  Yeah, I don't know if that's fucking right, dude.  As hard as you can.  Oh, this poor girl.  Oh, my God.  This guy's never getting laid again.  Oh, it smells so bad.  God, I wish I would have bought gloves.  Oh!  She's still getting shit out of this.  Oh.  That's funny.  My God.  Oh.  Oh, wow. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's a cottage cheese.  This follows you, right, Dan?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  Oh, my God.  Imagine sucking it out and eating it.  Oh, Jesus.  Brian, there's something wrong with you.  How much do you think they got out of that for the people out there?  I think we're almost done.  What are you doing?  A mouthful?  Does it hurt?  Oh, at least you still got that shit on your hands.  Right?  Dude, that's got to be at least two mayonnaise packets.  Oh, way more than that.  I don't think fat and cartilage smell like that. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Now we've got to smell this.  How do we smell this shit?  Would you smell this shit?  No.  Nah, I probably wouldn't either.  No?  You can't.  You wouldn't.  If I smelled it, I would puke.  That bugs me.  That bothers me.  The latter part of it is kind of grosser than the first part.  But it's still, it's kind of like, wow.  It's kind of amazing to watch that much shit come out of somebody's back.  Well, Psycho Bob in Baltimore.  Close to where Jimmy's going to be this weekend, right, Jimmy? 
[02:56:00]  Washington, D.C.  Washington.  Some tickets available for tomorrow night's show, I believe.  Yeah, Saturday.  Not many, though.  Saturday's totally sold.  And Friday Late Show had 26 tickets as of this morning.  Oh, you're not doing a show Thursday?  I am.  You are?  I'm saying the only one available really is Thursday.  Okay, good.  Psycho Bob in Baltimore.  Guys, if that stuff looks like cheese, it's probably an epidermal cyst.  And what is that?  It's just a cyst that's got, like, skin tissue in it.  See?  I told you.  And why does it smell so bad?  What does it smell like? 
[02:56:30]  Well, it doesn't smell bad.  You've got to taste it.  It's salty if you taste it.  How does he know that?  You've tasted this?  Uh, well, studies have shown that.  Oh.  That's what Jimmy says about tranny dick.  That's so disgusting.  It's a little salty.  How do you know, Jim?  Studies have shown.  Oh, studies have shown.  That tranny cock is a little salty when you first taste it.  It's an infected bug bite.  Everyone's got their fucking doctor now. 
[02:57:00]  They're all doctors.  It could be an infected ingrown hair.  It could be anything.  Oh, Neil has a good story.  It could be a bot fly.  Neil?  It's got bot fly in his neck.  Those are fucking nuts.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Where?  Uh, it's Bob has no fucking clue what he's talking about because the smell is so wretched.  I didn't say it didn't smell stupid.  What, Neil?  You just talked over your own punchline.  No, all I'm saying is that the smell is horrific.  Right.  It actually, I had a girlfriend cut mine open that I had on my back shoulder, and she actually 
[02:57:30]  got nauseous and almost passed out because of the smell alone.  I kind of want to smell it now.  It is horrific.  Like, you wouldn't fuck it.  How would anyone let their girlfriend do this?  I don't know.  Because it's fucking, it's just going to scar them on you for life.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I couldn't, I couldn't reach it.  I was, uh, I was about to take a trip somewhere warm.  I wanted to make sure that there wasn't a fucking lump on my shoulder, so I put her to  work.  Let's go to the doctor, motherfucker.  Can we have sis day? 
[02:58:00]  Come in and we'll, we'll fucking pop some of this shit with a doctor and then we'll smell  it.  Yeah, but I mean, you're, you're getting a little invasive when you're going that far  to make sure you're bringing a doctor for it.  Right.  Someone's saying it's from, uh, steroids.  That shit coming out is not normal pus.  It's from steroids.  No, that guy's not on steroids.  You see how skinny he was?  I don't know.  It had no, it was his back.  It looked like his fucking arm.  I need different answers by people.  It's hilarious.  I don't know.  That's gross.  What's going on, Bobby? 
[02:58:30]  We haven't even asked you about you yet.  What's going on?  I got the show coming out next weekend, 2-2, on the CBS.  Sunday night after the Good Wife on CBS, uh, the 2-2, NYC 2-2, the De Niro show.  Actually looks good.  It's weird when you film it, you don't know what it's going to be like because I only see the  shit I'm in.  Yeah.  But it's actually...  That was the stuff you were filming when we were fly fishing?  Yep.  Yep.  So that stuff hasn't aired yet.  No, it's airing.  Wow.  It's airing this, uh, the 15th, uh, April 15th.  That's this weekend.  Um, after the Good Wife, CBS, and it's, uh... 
[02:59:00]  You're in it.  I'm in it very, I'm, I'm in it like a little bit, just a little bit every episode.  Me and this other guy, we're kind of like the 10-year veterans that fuck with these rookie  guys.  But, uh, we have a scene, a couple scenes every show.  Yeah, that's cool.  But no, this actually looks, actually looks really good.  I saw the, uh...  Are you on the website?  No.  No.  Just the five, uh, what was it?  One, two, three?  One, two, three.  You should be on the website.  No.  Um, yeah, but they're, uh...  But you're in it. 
[02:59:30]  Every week.  Every week, yeah.  Except the last week.  I went to Aruba.  Good for you, Bobby.  Aruba!  Yeah.  You told them you couldn't film?  Yeah.  And they said, all right?  Well, um, yeah, but it was, it was just, you know, whatever.  It was what it was.  I had, I planned it.  I didn't know if, I had no idea it was going to be on every episode.  We did the pilot, and then they asked you to come back for the next one, and then  they were like, okay, what about next week?  Am I in it every week?  They didn't let you know.  I mean, I had no idea I was going to be in every one of them.  That's fantastic.  So they just kept putting them in, but it's a good show, good cast.  What do you play? 
[03:00:00]  Um, I play, uh, Moore.  What?  Officer Moore.  Oh, you're a cop.  Officer Moore.  And this other guy, Martini, Martini is my...  It writes itself.  That's funny.  Sorry.  I didn't even think of that.  You didn't think of that.  And, uh...  That's cruel.  Yeah, um, she's actually great, and, um, Adam Goldberg is fucking great.  Everybody's good.  Everybody's really good in it.  He's the guy that the big, uh, Nazi stabbed in, uh, Saving Private Ryan.  Yeah, he's funny, too.  Pretty nasty.  He's very funny.  He's like that dry humor. 
[03:00:30]  He would crack some good jokes on set.  Um, they're asking if your first name is, is Officer Eatsome.  Oh, like, cause it's more, uh, uh, uh, you know what sucks, too, is that none of them read  the thread, they just to get excited about getting a fat joke, so it's the same fat joke.  Over and over.  Just read.  Do me a favor.  Some of them are real funny.  Just read the thread first.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't be a fucking hack and repeat the same thing.  I apologize for that picture.  Boy, did that, 24 hours later, they were still pounding that photo. 
[03:01:00]  I, I, I blocked so many shit people.  Did you?  It was actually good.  Yeah.  Got them out of circulation.  Yeah, because this is the worst part.  You look and they're not even following me.  No.  It's like, you don't get to follow, I have rules, funny face, happy face, you get to  put smiley face right.  I love you, Bob.  That way I know you at least like me.  Yeah.  Fuck, if you're not following me, you don't get fucking gone.  No, you're gone.  I blocked.  You'll never get the opportunity to follow.  Oh, God, I blocked so many fucking hirotious cunts.  I took a, uh, I took a photo, it was of Bobby and Jimmy at my house, and, um. 
[03:01:30]  You gotta be careful over Ant's house.  They just ran, every time you're over there, there's a photo leaked on the internet.  Well, speaking of photos and leaked, you got a photo of us in the bathroom.  I'm sure you'll put that up on fucking YouTube.  Oh, that's a good one.  Was that a good picture?  It's a great picture, but I have a video that I could have put up, but I didn't.  When you were sleeping on your couch.  Oh, right.  That was a good one.  That was the one where Jimmy put his ass in my face.  Oh, that should be on the internet, no?  No.  No, I'm not gonna fucking, I don't wanna put Jimmy's cute ass out there. 
[03:02:00]  I want people to pay to see that.  Jack into it.  I don't wanna just give it to him for free.  It's too cute.  But he does have a little cute asshole right next to your sleeping drunk head.  I wasn't even drinking at that point.  I was just sleepy.  And you guys just stay after he falls asleep.  No, no, he woke up.  No, no, he woke up.  We first got there, he was out on the couch.  And you just walked in?  Oh, yeah.  He looked like a dad that just, you know, beat up his whole family in a drunken stupor and  then passed out on the couch.  I had no idea what he did. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, like Danny and Keith are whispering.  Danny and Keith are there.  They're just whispering, though, not trying to wake up the giant, the mean giant.  Don't wake up.  Yeah.  The king.  Ant would just wake up shooting.  Fuck, I said leave!  Oh, shit.  What else is up, Bobby?  This show looks good.  This is gonna be good.  We'll take a look at it this Sunday.  Yeah, support the show.  It's gonna be a good show.  I'm in it a little bit.  But it was fun.  It was fun.  And they shoot it at Chelsea.  A lot of it's at Chelsea Piers, which is hilarious. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because the old Law & Order studio they took over.  So you go to Chelsea Piers.  It's just a police station.  It's a fucking...  Inside you walk in, and there's a fucking police station.  That's fucked up.  And there's a deli.  They have a bodega inside, like, on the set.  So, you know, it's like fucking crazy shit.  But most of my shit's in the...  I think it's called the muster room or some shit.  Oh, right.  Where they all roll call and stuff.  Yeah, where I make...  Yeah, I quip.  The first thing...  The pilot, I think, airs... 
[03:03:30]  The pilot's the first one.  Sometimes they don't air the pilot first, but I think they are this time.  The director was great, and he was like,  Dude, just make shit up.  So I called the kid fucking Wikipedia or something.  And they brought the kid back, and his name was Wikipedia in the script now.  So, like, I gave this kid a part in the show, which was great.  You should get paid for that.  But some...  It's weird.  People don't know this.  I didn't know this.  That every week, there's a different director and a different...  Oh, it's one of those.  Okay.  ...different writer.  So you have to meet this new guy, and he may like you. 
[03:04:00]  He may not.  He may be cool.  He may be a dick.  He may be a woman.  You don't know.  And the writers, you don't know if they don't fucking...  They might rat you out.  This whole new fucking writer is in there writing his version of what it is.  And then the show kind of finds itself halfway through.  And then CBS is like, all right, this is what the show is.  And then they kind of go forth there.  But every week was like, am I going to be around?  And you get a call.  It's like, okay, you got one day. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  Oh, you got three days.  Oh, my God.  And by the end of it, it was actually cool.  They were actually giving you the better trailer.  Like, they call it a triple banger or a double banger.  When you first walk up, you had the honey wagon, which is basically a bench indoors with a toilet.  It's very classy.  Way better than fucking extras.  Just standing outside.  No, they're in like a church basement somewhere 10 miles away from the set.  And they're just eating fruit roll-ups and water. 
[03:05:00]  And waiting hours.  They keep giving them sugar.  What, do you get a honey wagon?  I missed part of it.  Yeah, I was just telling them the honey...  No, I got the double banger at the end of the shoot.  They were actually hooking us up.  Like, the crew on this was fucking awesome.  New York City crews are the shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, first of all, the guys, you know, the transport guys, they're all fucking union dudes from...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, hey, how you doing, fucking Giants?  Fuck the Patriots every day.  Fuck the Red Side.  You know, I was busting my balls.  With that language?  But, yeah.  They're very rough.  That's a fun work environment.  I mean, really. 
[03:05:30]  They're real good guys.  And the crew was great.  And the directors...  Like, one of the directors was Jake Gyllenhaal's dad, which was weird.  I just wanted to go, can I meet your son?  That's all that was on my brain.  That's a weird thing.  Yeah, his dad's been a director for TV.  Director, and the son kind of is more well-known than the dad.  Well, I mean, the guy's been around for a fucking while, though.  So...  What do you do, like direct family ties and stuff?  Eh, something like that.  Yeah, like Blue Bloods.  It's weird that these people go from...  Episodes of Punky Brewster.  They go from Law & Order to Blue Bloods to over here, and they just keep going back and forth. 
[03:06:00]  Same genre.  Yeah.  Yeah, like there's a lot of shows filming in New York now.  USA Network, most of their shows are filmed in New York, which is great.  There's a lot of work in New York.  They bounce around like foster children from place to place.  Oh, really?  I was in foster care.  I know.  It's terrible.  You're all right, though.  Huh?  It worked out for you.  What, the foster care?  You're good.  You're good now. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, I'm good now.  You're good now.  Got a show coming.  You're on a show, Sunday.  That'd be great if this fucking...  After the good one.  If this thing becomes a hit, one of two things is going to happen.  I'm gone.  They'll write you out.  I'm gone.  They immediately...  Because everybody wants more money, so immediately they just cut the fat.  No pun intended.  There you go.  Twit that, you fucking idiots.  Twit that.  You mean you?  It's now a twit.  Twit that.  Well, they'll actually go, look, we want you and the other guy, you know, to, like a  contractor, at least pay you some, like so.  And give you more lines.  You can just stick around. 
[03:07:00]  Maybe they make you a bigger part.  Well, here's the thing is that it was hard because I could make more money some weeks  on the road.  Yeah.  So it's like, I'm not fucking...  I'm not an actor just waiting for a gig.  I have to go do this gig.  It's a lot more money than you're paying me.  You're in that photo?  No.  No, no, no.  I'm in the trailer, though.  They put me in the trailer.  You should sacrifice, though, and do some acting.  Yeah, no.  Because you never know where it's going to lead.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was really good.  It came out pretty good.  You never know.  I thought it was going to be cheesy, but it's actually good.  Check it out.  It's Sunday night.  All right.  You're going to be in Chicago, Bobby.  Good, Bobby.  I will.  Bob Kelly in Chicago. 
[03:07:30]  Up Comedy Club in Chicago.  Yes.  Friday through Sunday.  It's a new club, huh?  Brand new club.  Downtown.  It's fucking...  I'm excited to play it.  UpComedyClub.com for your tickets.  Bobby's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Do you go to Chicago a lot?  I go to the Improv outside of Chicago, which is one of my favorite clubs.  I think these guys are affiliated.  I think.  I don't know.  But I'm in downtown.  This is kind of a hipper room, a smaller room.  Then the other one's like a 500-seater.  This one's actually a little smaller, which is cool. 
[03:08:00]  So, yeah, it's going to be great.  I am fucking hilarious.  On this show, I'm good, but stand-up-wise.  Right, Ant?  Come on, Ant.  Back me up.  Opie, come on.  I hear you.  I was the one who started it and said you were hilarious.  I know.  I'm trying to get him fucking whipping up on...  ...off the fucking pal talk.  Well, Ant saw you recently.  This cock-secker's trying to look at racks.  When you need the big help and the big fucking push.  Yeah, go for big...  You're looking for the push and Ant's looking at tits.  You know better than I.  Just before fucking Norton makes people not buy tickets. 
[03:08:30]  I wouldn't buy people.  Yeah, you do, you fucking dumb.  He's going to trash me.  Bobby Kelly is very, very funny.  I never trash your act.  Bobby happens to be very good.  He does a good job.  His act is very funny.  Very funny, yes.  And I right now have my hand on his balls.  I see.  And I will keep saying positive things as long as my hand is on his balls.  He is touching his balls.  I have both of his balls in my hand.  Is it warm?  It's my thumb.  It just feels gross.  But I'm going to say this.  That his act really has gotten good.  Oh, dude.  Oh, my God! 
[03:09:00]  What happened?  How did you do it?  How did you do it?  I actually was squeeching my asshole, so my balls went in and out.  So they were moving.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, he couldn't take that.  You didn't like that?  And you started getting really close like you were going in for a kiss.  Yeah, no man could take that.  No, he's shivering.  That was rough.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Shake it off.  Shake it off.  Shake it off.  No, no, no.  It's the right thing to do.  What got you?  Just the fact that I could feel his cough.  And I'm like, if it starts to get hard, I had to just stop. 
[03:09:30]  There's no turning back.  It'll ruin the friendship.  Right, there's no turning back.  Yeah, it'll ruin it or make it better.  You can't get hard in your friend's hand.  Yeah, me and you are going to start hanging out more.  You're so right.  You can't do that.  No, no, no.  There's no turning back from that.  It changes the dynamic of the friendship.  I'll tell my wife to bait it, sell my place, move in with this fucking homo, and be his opening act.  You want to fuck around?  Let's do this.  Let's do this.  So Bobby's in Chicago, Friday through Sunday. 
[03:10:00]  There's Bobby.  There he is right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Bobby!  Play the clip, Sam.  Sam, stop writing your notes for your shit show.  Stop writing, Sam!  Are you going to talk in this scene?  I don't know.  I don't know what Sam brought up.  Let's see.  Let's go.  Thanks for making it through to the 2-2.  Welcome.  Stop one real quick.  That's the guy from 3 o'clock high.  3 o'clock.  Is it 3 o'clock high?  Oh, Buddy.  Is that the name of it?  Yeah.  Yeah, Buddy.  No, Buddy Revelle's the other guy.  He's a great guy.  All right.  Good.  Really?  Hey, really, Bobby! 
[03:10:30]  Really?  Really?  You go, really?  Yeah.  I heard that.  That's good.  Why did you say really?  Oh, because he's clapping?  No, they said, I don't know.  They said something.  Let's see if there's more Bobby.  A round of applause for making it through to the 2-2.  Welcome.  Really?  I'm your field training officer.  Here are my orders of the day.  Don't get hurt.  Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.  In essence, just stand there.  You a cop?  What gave it away? 
[03:11:00]  Damn, that one is mine.  Can I talk to you for a second?  Fox.  Oh, shit.  A tough broad.  She's going into labor.  Do you have something to say to me?  It's a tough rookie year.  Guy from The Wire.  Oh, that's right.  Who?  White guy.  Thanks.  Cool.  You know...  Boss, can I just ask how the other rookies do today?  Worse.  Most rookies just stand on the corner. 
[03:11:30]  Their superiors come by.  They sign their book.  And then they just stand there.  Not explosions and shit.  Not these guys.  I know.  It's explosions.  They're fucking delivering babies.  There's a gang fight with baseball bats.  Most of the guys, they're like,  Hey, Sarge.  Yeah, sign the book.  It's up in the Bronx, too.  And when we first started shooting,  we didn't get the rides, the limos.  You either had to wait for the van or take the train.  I got bad directions one night from one of the fucking PAs. 
[03:12:00]  I got out at the polo grounds around 1130 at night.  Oh, that's bad.  That's pleasant.  Yeah, when you have a Red Sox hat on, you're white.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, across from Yankee Stadium.  Wow, yeah.  Okay.  I mean, I was being followed.  Like I was walking.  Yo, yo, yo.  They thought finally they had to come pick me up.  But I was shitting my pants.  Shitting my pants.  They were every corner.  There was like a deal going on.  I was stuck between streets.  Like I was hiding in between streets.  You didn't want to go out in the daylight? 
[03:12:30]  If I went down there, these guys,  I already was down that side, the corner,  and the guy was like,  Yo, yo, what the fuck you doing?  Like they thought I was a cop or something.  Because of your bandolier.  I didn't have this on.  If I had this on, I would have been fucking saved.  It would have been all right.  So wait, they gave you,  how mad were you with the bad directions?  Oh, I was fucking frustrated, man.  And this, I mean, I could have been,  it could have went south real far.  There's no cabs up there, right?  No, no, they have the,  you can't just hail a cab  and fucking the polo grounds.  They don't stop.  Well, they will stop for me.  Yeah, for you they would.  Get in. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, get in quick.  Actually, they all stop for you.  They're just rolling with the door open.  But they don't have cabs up there.  They have the livery drivers.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Oh, right.  Like the limos.  So wait, so what did you do?  I mean,  I hid between streets  until the fucking van came and picked me up.  Oh, did you scream at them?  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?  I didn't scream at them,  but I thought it was kind of funny  that I, you know,  it was just how scared I was.  Probably for no,  I don't know, for no reason,  but I was.  Oh, you never know.  You know.  Well, we're going to watch the show  on CBS Sunday after the good life. 
[03:13:30]  CBS!  Yes.  Good luck in Chicago, Bobby.  Thank you, man.  Good to see you.  That was a blast.  Jimmy will be here tomorrow,  but he is going to be in Washington this weekend.
