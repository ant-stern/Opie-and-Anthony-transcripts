<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of the Republican primary, focusing on Mitt Romney's win in Florida and Newt Gingrich's continued campaign despite dwindling prospects.  The hosts satirized Romney with a mocking patriotic song and discussed the surprising wealth of past presidents, debating the accessibility of the presidency to those from less privileged backgrounds.  They also criticized the influence of early primary states and the debate stage positioning, further analyzing Gingrich's weakening campaign and briefly mentioning Romney's Secret Service protection.  A humorous tangent involved a video of someone darning a sock, highlighting the perceived uselessness of the skill today.  The show also commented on a controversial CareerBuilder Super Bowl commercial featuring chimps.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a highly offensive and critical discussion of Rachel Maddow's accusations against Newt Gingrich, using extremely vulgar language towards Maddow and Al Sharpton, accusing them of hypocrisy and racial opportunism.  The hosts reminisced about a former show contributor, "Spaz," recalling his comedic bits and departure.  Upcoming guests JWoww and Snooki were mentioned.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about one of the hosts' new home, specifically its jacuzzi and shower, before shifting to Janet Jackson's Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction and its alleged impact on the radio industry.  The hosts expressed their significant frustration with their exclusion from SiriusXM's Super Bowl coverage for seventeen years, using highly offensive language toward a SiriusXM employee named Gary and other personnel.  They also discussed a "happy light" brought to the studio to combat seasonal affective disorder, mocking it with numerous vulgar jokes. A brief call with Dr. Steve ensued, during which they discussed seasonal affective disorder, vitamin D, and other topics, with the hosts interjecting numerous crude jokes.  The segment concluded with renewed complaints about their treatment by SiriusXM.

A later segment featured a discussion about Vitamin B12, sleep apnea, and self-administering B12 shots with Dr. Steve, who was in studio.  The conversation included humorous tangents about sleep studies and large breasts.  After Dr. Steve left, the conversation shifted to listener comments, a "worst best man" contest, and the upcoming appearance of Snooki and JWoww, mentioning Snooki's engagement and weight loss.  They then discussed allegations of sexual misconduct against Bernie Fine, a Syracuse basketball assistant coach, with crude humor and speculation.  A graphic video of children participating in the cinnamon challenge was shown, eliciting disgust and outrage from the hosts at the parents’ behavior.  A pre-recorded bit with "Spaz" about a giant mosquito infestation followed, with a caller adding a bizarre story involving the KKK.  The segment also covered Rachel Maddow's appearance on Howard Stern's show, with further crude jokes about her, followed by a news item about the potential release of Osama bin Laden's death photos.  Opie described his experience at a shooting range, discussing his new shotgun and a high school gun club.  The death of Don Cornelius led to a discussion of *Soul Train* and *American Bandstand*, concluding with a humorous anecdote about a shredded announcement.

The final segment focused on the delayed arrival of Snooki and JWoww, with the hosts and crew engaging in humorous and often vulgar speculation about the delay, including Snooki’s unannounced pregnancy leaked by Radar Online.  They discussed Snooki’s perfume and, once the guests arrived, their new spin-off show, dealing with online criticism, past bullying, a past incident where Snooki was punched, and the hosts' initial negative perceptions of her.  The conversation also touched upon their public image, relationships, and future plans, along with discussions about various aspects of *Jersey Shore* and a past incident involving a stalker named Steve.  The segment concluded with plugs for Snooki and JWoww's show and social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  All right.  I think we should play the Mitt Romney song to get everyone in the mood for some good radio today.  Yeah, why not?  Mitt Romney?  I'm a root one.  You know, I love this song.  No, you don't.  No one loves patriotic songs.  Oh, beautiful.  We deal with patriotic songs.  Or spacious sky.  High above the fruit head. 
[00:00:30]  A lane.  Above the fruited plain.  He's got no fucking game.  No soul, Yoz.  He's such a liar, though.  This guy's a liar.  He lies.  Because no one likes patriotic songs.  I love this one.  No, you don't.  I love this one.  You're really?  Like he sits around and just plays patriotic songs.  You got it on your iPhone?  Do you listen to it when you're driving?  It's not quite a toe tapper.  Can you sing that song?  I love that song. 
[00:01:00]  You know that song?  I love that song.  Oh, beautiful for spacious skies.  For amber waves of grain.  For purple mountains majesty.  All of the fruited plain.  Fruited.  America, America.  God shed his grace on thee.  And crown thy good.  This is going great.  From other earth. 
[00:01:30]  From sea to shining sea.  Whoa.  Yay.  As everyone's just droning on in the background like fucking zombies.  Yeah.  Like a cult.  Yeah.  Stop lying, Mitt.  You don't love that song.  I love this song.  That was a great little number.  Know who loves songs like that?  The boys after they came back from the big one.  From WWII?  Yeah.  When they were back home.  Yeah.  Or coming back home.  When the dough boys came back. 
[00:02:00]  They were cranking those songs.  Going further back.  Yeah.  But Romney kicked Newt Gingrich's ass there in Florida.  No surprise.  Yes.  Yes.  No surprise there, by the way.  Republican primary in Florida.  Like three to one, I guess.  And he was out spending them down there.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're really rich, you could be president.  Yeah.  Well, that's always been the game.  Well, yeah.  But they make believe anyone could become president.  They teach that in school. 
[00:02:30]  You know, someday maybe you could be president.  If you study hard and get good grades, you can be president.  Oh, yeah.  And hopefully you're a billionaire, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Hopefully you could raise billions of dollars.  Throw that in there.  When did it become where you had to be extremely rich to become president?  I think you got to go before Kennedy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I think so.  Who was the last president that wasn't rich?  Honest Abe? 
[00:03:00]  Was it Honest Abe Lincoln?  This big, dumb hat.  Maybe he had money stashed in there.  Anybody have the answer, you think?  Was Clinton rich?  I don't think he was poor.  He went to Oxford, didn't he?  Yeah.  He went to a scholarship, though.  Well, wasn't really?  He's a smart guy.  Even if you're on a scholarship.  I really wonder who was the last working class Joe.  You probably have to go back a long way.  Was Lyndon Johnson?  I'm sure he was.  I'm just thrown by his accent.  How about Ike? 
[00:03:30]  Lyndon Johnson.  I like Ike.  Had to be rich.  Being from Texas?  Oh, right.  Probably had some of that oil money.  What?  I think your military guy is like Eisenhower.  Maybe go with Eisenhower?  That's a military guy.  Right.  You know, no money.  He's just getting an honest wage from his military career.  Romney kicked his ass, mostly because I think he has a lot more money, especially in Florida.  I think people are getting fed up with Newt's hijinks and shenanigans with, you know, just not backing out even though he's losing. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, man.  Forty-six states to go.  You know what it is, though?  Forty-six states to go.  He's becoming that guy that everyone recognizes should back out and isn't.  So, he's becoming less and less of a threat.  What was that?  Newt?  Newt, yeah.  Shouldn't, like, a Santorum back out before?  Before Newt does?  Yeah.  Isn't it kind of protocol that Rick Santorum should now back out?  I thought he was out.  Ron Paul, you know, is not backing out.  No, because he's got a message.  No, he's going to be one of those fucking pilot fish. 
[00:04:30]  He doesn't even really.  Hang under a shark's mouth.  He doesn't even want to be president.  Yeah.  Do people know that?  He just wants to get his message out there.  Yeah.  That the whole system is fucked up.  He doesn't actually want to try to fix it.  No.  Eventually, Newt will have to leave the race.  Again, I think he's just going to become one of these guys that no one really listens to or takes seriously during this whole thing.  Yeah.  And hearing Mitt kind of bash Obama last night was refreshing.  Instead of them just going back and forth, he's kind of taking the lead now as the Republican frontrunner. 
[00:05:00]  Also, he's got Secret Service protection.  Starting today.  Starting today.  Why?  Well, there's big crowds.  He's kind of the frontrunner.  I think they're anticipating that he's going to be the guy, so they're kind of getting their ducks in order.  Yeah, they don't want to.  They don't want a Robert Kennedy situation.  They don't want a Robert Kennedy situation.  Yeah, right.  I actually drove right by where that Jonathan showed me.  I've been by where the ambassador used to be in L.A.  Yeah.  We were riding by, and it was right there. 
[00:05:30]  So there's a little memorial for him.  Yeah, let's cut through the kitchen.  Didn't they close down that place for a while?  It's gone.  It's a school now.  It is a school.  Yeah.  Is it the Robert F. Kennedy School?  I don't know.  Boy, would that be in bad taste.  As long as it's not the Sirhan Sirhan.  Yeah, it's a big memorial to him.  And John said he actually got to stand where it happened.  He said after they were shooting something there, so to speak.  Well, we got to stand where Kennedy got shot.  JFK.  Yep.  That's always fun, taking your turn on the X.  Ah, sure. 
[00:06:00]  Hoping the traffic doesn't hit you.  Doesn't hit you.  Become a casualty.  Dallas, Texas.  Oh, me and Jimmy almost saw a lady just buying it.  Yeah, that would have been great.  Emasculating, awful woman.  Just completely clueless, trying to get her picture on the X as, you know, there's traffic  coming.  Because the locals in Dallas, they don't want to deal with that anymore.  So they're not slowing down for you because you're on the X trying to get your picture  taken.  Nah.  And man, we almost saw someone buy it.  It was close.  So that's your headline.  Romney kicked Newt Gingrich's ass in Florida. 
[00:06:30]  Got him.  Yeah, he's going to be the guy.  You know.  Positive?  Yeah.  Pretty tough to lose at this point?  Yeah.  Now, you know, when you get that kind of momentum and there's not a shitload of candidates  left, you got to start, like, rallying behind them if you're a Republican and, you know,  hey, this is our guy.  Well, you know, the GOP's got to sit Newt down and go, hey, man, for the sake of the  party, you got to fucking do the right thing.  Well, yeah, but again, he's looking like an idiot now. 
[00:07:00]  He's not looking like a guy that's like, well, this guy could shake things up.  He could say things he could do.  Because now he's just looking like a right note.  Leave already.  Stop.  Well, why is he looking like an idiot?  It's not like there's a lot of votes still to be had.  Yeah, but everyone knows he should be out of this.  He should back out.  Why is a country we decide after four states that this is the guy?  Right.  Well, I know.  That's silly, too.  Ronnie brought that up and was like, holy shit, you're right.  Most of the country doesn't matter.  No, most of the country doesn't get to vote. 
[00:07:30]  They don't even get to vote.  That's crazy.  Even in the states where there's primaries, people don't vote.  They really want to control how we vote for our candidates.  Yeah, it's like, well, the vote's up to you, the American people, but here's your guys  that you can vote for, really, thanks.  But someone picked a long time ago, I don't know, because I fell asleep in history.  You got New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Florida, right?  That's the four states.  That's the four states, and by Florida, okay, here's your guy.  Well, they move on to Nevada next. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, but most...  Yeah, now it's pretty much...  Like you're saying, that Newt needs to leave after four states.  Yeah.  And they also have a weird way of setting it.  Like, during those debates, it should be a random way that they stand.  Like, I hated the way they would stand the two frontrunners in the center of the camera.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It just looks like they're the guy.  It does.  It's like they're rigging it.  Not fair for the other guys.  It should be absolutely...  I would say alphabetical, but even that's not fair.  A random every time.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  You know, like, why should Ron Paul or whoever stand in the fucking corner?  Yeah, the guys that are way on the edges, they don't get anything.  They look like fringe guys, as opposed to the something about the guy Center Square that  looks like that's the guy.  And it's like, I don't give a fuck Mitt Romney.  I don't hate him.  I'm sure he's a nice guy.  But, I don't know.  Fuck him.  He annoys me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy Wacko writes on Twitter, it's possible...  Jimmy Wacko?  It's possible Romney is truly that boring.  He might love that song.  He just might like that one.  Above the Fruited Plains. 
[00:09:00]  Fruited.  Fruited.  That's just terrible.  Nude is waiting for Super Tuesday.  What's Super Tuesday?  A bunch of states?  Oh, it's Tuesday that saves people and see through things, but is vulnerable to cryptomy.  What's the Super Tuesday?  Is that five states all in one?  Yeah, all at once.  I don't even know which ones they are.  It's whatever.  We got the answer. 
[00:09:30]  The last non-rich president was who?  Harry S?  Harry S. Truman?  How do you know he wasn't rich?  I looked up the net worth of all the presidents.  Yeah, but he was back in the day when the money meant more.  Yeah, but everything.  He was the last one that was less than $1 million.  The buck stops here so he could take it.  That's pretty much historical quote humor.  His worth was less than a million?  Mm-hmm.  Holy fuck.  And then Calvin Coolidge before him. 
[00:10:00]  At what?  Less than a million.  Holy mackerel.  And everyone else way over the million?  Yeah, like FDR was $60 million.  $60 million?  Hoover was $75 million.  Couldn't buy him legs, though, right?  Yeah, see?  Said all money saved on shoes.  Teddy Roosevelt was $125 million.  Bully.  Bully.  What?  That's right.  I always thought he was just a regular guy.  Just a broke hunter guy.  Adventure rider.  He was worth $125 million in today's dollars? 
[00:10:30]  We just have rich guys.  Of course.  Like, yeah, it's all bullshit when they tell you in school you can be president.  No, you can't.  No, you can't.  George Washington was $525 million.  That's today's money.  No way.  Stop.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it's today's money.  That's today's money.  Yeah, they didn't even have that much money in the country back then.  He owned every dollar.  Wow, he fucking was rich.  They all are, man.  You always feel like George Washington was just a regular farmer guy that came out.  Man.  He was rich. 
[00:11:00]  The founding fathers were the one percenters, man.  Of course they were.  They were, actually.  Yes, they were.  Literally.  They really, they really, I mean, I know I've bashed the founding fathers because of  the hypocrisy of slave owners.  Yeah.  The tribe at freedom, it just drives me fucking nuts.  It was the time.  They weren't considered human back then.  Yeah, but they knew it was right and wrong.  Yeah.  They knew it was right and wrong, yeah.  Abe Lincoln was less than one.  Yeah, but.  That has to be today's dollars, obviously.  Yeah, I'm sure it's today's dollars.  Okay, wow, all right.  Because Thomas Jefferson was $200 million. 
[00:11:30]  $200 million?  Did you get any of that?  Because he's a relative, right?  No?  He didn't pass it down to you there, Sammy?  Not yet.  How about JFK?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  The Kennedy clan.  Yeah.  They got quite a few bucks.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, that bootlegging was good money.  Although he never inherited his father's fortune, the Kennedy family estate was worth nearly  $1 billion.  A billion.  He's the richest.  He was the richest.  Wow. 
[00:12:00]  Damn.  Although.  Money coming out his nose, along with his prints.  So keep believing that you could be president someday, kids.  Right.  LBJ was $98 million.  What was Nixon?  President.  Tricky Dicky had some bucks.  $15 million?  Ah, not that much.  Nah.  As far as the president goes.  Fair enough for the Western White House.  Oh, Clinton.  Clinton was $38 million.  Jesus.  Why is there no cap on what you can spend?  Well, I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  Like.  That's a really good question.  Yeah.  I mean, whether you like Newt or not, he, you know, didn't have a chance in Florida.  I don't like him.  They've talked about it on the news a lot.  But Mitt was outspending him six to one, something like that.  It's like anything else, even a product.  You know, if a product has a great advertising campaign because they have the funds for it,  it's going to outsell a mom and pop brand that might actually be better than the name brand.  But the name brand is the one that gets the advertising. 
[00:13:00]  What do you think?  People look at it differently because they're people and you're voting for president?  No.  It's the same fucking mindset of this guy's face is in front of me all the time on television.  It must be good.  It must be good.  That's why we should question that because America in general is stupid.  It is.  And they buy into that way too easily.  Exactly.  We go into CVS, right?  We're all scared to buy the no frills brand.  Oh, yeah.  Even though you look at it with the brand name you know and it's the exact, I mean, the exact same ingredients. 
[00:13:30]  Ingredients, everything.  But you don't want to look like a person that would buy that.  I've asked a pharmacist what's the difference.  And like chemically, I forget what it was between Nexium.  Right.  And whatever the name brand was.  She said something about when one was...  Come on, Valtrex.  We all know what you really mean.  No, no, no.  I forget what the real one for that one is.  Valsutra or something.  But the...  No, it was some chemical, a minor chemical switch that did not affect at all. 
[00:14:00]  One of the inert ingredients?  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  What?  That sounds right.  Well, one of the things that don't do anything in me.  Inert?  Yeah.  Like a lot of medications, the pill is made up of a lot of inert material, which doesn't  have any kind of a medical benefit, but you have to make the pill bigger.  So it's, you know, if you just put the medicine in, it would be this little tiny pill.  So in order to make it bigger and make it a certain shape and stuff, they add in these  fillers that really don't...  What are the fillers?  It's just sometimes it's grains, starch, things like that. 
[00:14:30]  Really?  Yeah.  How the fuck do you know this shit?  I can't believe he knows that.  Well, I was working at a vitamin factory once when I...  Really?  When I was doing air conditioning, heating, and ventilation, I had to ventilate the dust  that would come off of it.  So I watched the vitamin machines go around.  And a lot of the vitamins are just filler.  It's just like this filler powder that would go in, and a little dye and tool and dye would  go...  And then vitamins would come out like all crazy in the conveyor belt.  How do they measure it perfectly for each vitamin?  I don't get that. 
[00:15:00]  It's a bunch of dust.  Right.  And it comes out of this big tube onto a flat metal disc with little holes in it that are  shaped like the vitamin.  So as it's turning, the little holes fill up with the powder.  And then a compression thing goes into the hole and compresses it into the shape of a vitamin.  So it automatically knows how much is in there just for the fact that it's filling the hole up.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  You've got to figure out how to make that machine.  I know.  The machines are more amazing than what the machines are making.  Obviously one of the greatest shows ever. 
[00:15:30]  I was watching How It's Made.  They had a marathon going.  And yeah, I'm just like...  But it does depress me watching that show because I just imagine the hell of having one of those jobs.  You see these people and their whole job is just picking out paper clips that aren't bent properly.  You know, it's like, God, just kill yourself.  That just sucks.  Oh, it's horrible.  All day long.  All day.  Wow.  I get a kick out of those.  I saw how they made a kayak.  Yeah.  And how they have to take the material and stretch it out and measure it and do the stitching. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, doesn't it look like a pain?  Oh, it's such.  It looks like too much work and concentration.  I saw I'm making a hockey fucking skate.  There's 8,000 different panels on those hockey skates that are bent over each other and Kevlar and fucking carbon fiber.  And then these old ladies just sit there sewing it.  And they're not even looking.  They're like, ba, ba, ba.  1,000 miles an hour.  Unbelievable.  They don't get their thumbs stuck in there.  It just looks frightening.  I literally can't sew a button. 
[00:16:30]  No?  No.  Sew, sew, sew your pants.  Remember when someone would go, sew?  You'd go, sew, sew, sew your pants.  Ha, ha, ha, ship finds that hilarious.  That's a good one.  He's going to lean over and rub me with his forearm.  Why would you want to sew a button?  Well, I'm saying it's a basic function.  No, it's not.  Yeah, if a button falls off.  Who hasn't been getting ready for the grand party?  Ah, I'd track.  Ah.  Darn button.  My button's off and I've had avocats spilt on me.  You hand it over to the broad. 
[00:17:00]  Ah.  That's good if you get a broad.  Let it dame.  Let it dame.  You give it to the dame.  But I'm single.  They learned that from an early age, how to sew buttons on.  Women have gotten a little lackadaisical about that shit, though, man.  They don't know how to.  They used to have special skills.  They used to take the little fucking handball and shove it in the sock and sew the sock up.  Jesus.  Like, now they just get you a new pair of fucking socks.  Like, here, I got you a new pair.  Is that how they would do it?  Yeah, in the old days, they would call darning the sock.  Jesus.  Darning.  And they put the little ball in there. 
[00:17:30]  I guess they were going to say damning, but tarning.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Exactly, Chip.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't do that.  He came over to give me the old funny elbow, and it doesn't work right.  He rubs his forearm.  How do you know it's called darning, though?  From a Honeymooners episode.  Yeah, but I saw that same Honeymooners episode, I'm sure.  What are they doing?  I don't remember that.  Don't they cook for you, and clean for you, and darn your socks for you?  Oh.  Carlos.  He doesn't say, and iron your socks.  It's darn.  No.  It's darn your socks for you? 
[00:18:00]  Darn.  Look at this.  All because there's a hole in your sock?  Get out of here.  Yeah.  Doesn't that look like a big pain in the ass?  She could be cooking a pot roast.  Buy new socks!  Exactly.  Sinatra used to have to wear new socks every day.  It was a weirdly hated, ripped socks, I guess.  I bet because his feet reeked really bad.  Nothing.  Fucking booze oozing out of his fucking foot sweat pores.  Nothing better than giving in and getting new socks, though.  I'm done, dude.  Oh, the feeling.  Oh, I'm so due.  What's worse than a fucking toenail poking through that hole? 
[00:18:30]  You're like, oh, you mother's cunt.  That is horrible, man.  Oh, God.  I loathe a hole in my sock.  Oh, that's terrible.  Every sock I have looks like Kennedy's hat.  You go golden toe?  Um, yeah.  You go golden toe?  What?  The white golden toes?  No.  It's the brand.  I just, uh, regular white socks.  I don't really wear white socks a lot.  I wear dress socks all the time.  Oh, my God.  The material in dress socks.  Not the thick ones.  No, I mean the thin ones.  Not the thin ones.  I like this.  No.  It's very smooth. 
[00:19:00]  It's very smooth.  That's not 100% cotton.  How thick are those?  They're kind of, uh...  Mine are, like, kind of thick.  Oh!  Doing footsie.  That's sick.  Dude, Jimmy's playing footsie with me.  I have a thicker dress sock on.  Yes, a thicker dress sock.  I like a good, smooth dress sock.  They don't breathe, man.  No, no.  You feel your sweats are staying in there.  No, they're not the old school, like, put-in-a-fucking-floor-shime shoe.  Yeah.  They're, uh, you know.  How long is this fucking darning video?  Oh, my God.  It takes forever.  And look at it.  It looks like shit. 
[00:19:30]  That's stupid.  Buy a new sock, you dumb old broad.  Who are you?  Mrs. Ingalls?  Put a patch on it.  Now your big toe's gonna be uncomfortable in that sock.  And churn some butter after this?  How big is that hole?  Yeah, really.  What was he doing?  Fucking bear bit him.  It's the old, old school.  Yeah.  When you're fucking steel-toe booting minorities, you have to come home and your wife has to darn your sock.  That's Heather Mills' pant leg.  After the spill.  After the spill.  She could darn a sock just by putting it on her stump instead of using the ball.  A darn a sock? 
[00:20:00]  I never heard that.  Darn.  We'll forget the word, though.  Ask us tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  Now she's gotta go the other way.  What?  She's pretty much knitting a new sock.  And all the material you had to buy for that, you could have used that for a new sock.  That's stupid.  That's dumb.  Boy, do you have to go both ways?  Yeah.  Now she's like weaving it.  It's one of those skills that you don't need anymore.  No, this shit is done.  This is just dumb.  This went out with churning butter and fucking...  She's basically making a new sock.  Making birch beer.  If you had a choice between a girl who could really suck dick and one who could darn a sock, 
[00:20:30]  is there anyone that would take this skill?  Oh, man.  Who would choose this?  I bet a sock darner doesn't suck a good dick.  No, big fat girl.  She's like, there's fucking skin tags under her arms, but she can darn a heck of a sock.  Look at this.  It's exhausting.  It looks terrible.  It does look like shit.  It's like a fucking wound.  What year is this from?  Just darning a condom on the tip of your dick.  Can you fast forward through this?  We know how it ends. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Probably with a gunshot wound to her own head.  Oh, my God.  It's still going.  She's literally weaving.  Okay, this video is nine minutes long.  Would you take nine minutes to fix one sock?  Why would you do that?  And it's longer than nine minutes because it's not real time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're cutting.  They're doing certain cuts.  Oh, it's Sam?  Sorry.  Look at that.  She's knitted a whole crossweave of yarn on the front of a sock. 
[00:21:30]  It has 192,000.  It has more views than fucking my videos for stand-up.  That's crazy.  And a shitload of likes.  Why would anyone watch this?  It is amazing.  Look at that.  Please dislike this video.  I hate this video.  The front of it now, the front of the sock now, if you're a Star Trek fan, looks like  the front of a Yeoman Rand's hairdo.  That basket weave fucking...  What is that?  I got it.  Why would you do that?  Use gray stitching, maybe.  Well, that was to show the people watching the video. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, thanks.  I didn't realize that, Jimmy.  No?  Oh.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it would blend in and you wouldn't know.  All right, stop sewing!  You know what we need?  Can you sing that song?  I love that song.  I love it.  You know that song?  I love it.  Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountains' majesty,  above the fruited plain, America, America, God shed his grace on thee, and crown thy good 
[00:22:30]  with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.  Keep talking that, Jimmy.  Kevin from Connecticut saying, yes, he has the voice of a Republican.  Yeah.  Republican's not known.  Remember the MC Rove?  Remember MC Rove?  Humiliating. 
[00:23:00]  When he did that, MC Rove!  They were doing a bad rap.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  God, was that fucking embarrassing.  That was more Republican shit.  Look at these old white guy Republicans doing this.  He can't be beat because he's so white from his head to his feet.  But he will rap it when you give him a chance.  Look at him move, doing a rap and dance.  That's true.  He's a dancing resident.  He is a sidekick to the president.  He's going to play a ball and tell me what is your name. 
[00:23:30]  MC Rove.  That's true.  Oh, God, this is terrible.  Are you embarrassed?  It's so embarrassing.  He's trying to...  Look at the black guy who can actually dance, of course.  No, he can't dance.  What is he doing?  He's a black Republican.  He's got so much to prove.  And tell me you never thought this man...  But this is the correspondence dinner, right?  Whatever it is.  They let it hang out.  It doesn't give you an excuse to just be a complete asshole. 
[00:24:00]  And talking, and dancing, and talking, and dancing, and talking, and dancing, and talking.  It's fucking awful.  Oh, what's your name?  MC Rove.  Oh, he looks like an idiot.  This is so embarrassing.  Yeah, it's terrible.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.  In reality, it doesn't work like it does in those wacky comedy movies when the old white  people start hip-hopping, usually at the end of the movie. 
[00:24:30]  It's humiliating, and I hate when they paint it any other way.  Yeah.  Wow.  How long is this time for?  Holy mother of fuck.  Terrible.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  One more thing about...  Fucking me. 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  All right, MC Rove.  One more thing about politics.  Rachel Maddow.  Ah, that man.  That gentleman.  What did he say?  Yes, of course.  Well, this will drive you a little nuts.  She accuses Newt Gingrich of making racial allusions.  And fucking the scowler himself had a pipe in.  What?  Al Sharpton, who just sits there and scowls the entire time he's on TV.  Of course he does.  Making everyone uncomfortable.  So angry.  Why does anybody just tell him he's a twat? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  We do.  Back off shit head.  I mean, people on shows just go, shut up.  Yeah.  They're too scared of him, man.  It's really weird.  People that have been on MSNBC forever, now they have to do panel with him, and you can  see they're scared that they might say the wrong thing in front of the scowler.  I'm calling it now MIRSMBC, because all they do now is fucking preach that we're not paying  our fair share of taxes.  Every one of those promos, it was all about doing your best for the country and paying  your fair share of taxes. 
[00:26:00]  What are they fucking in cahoots?  They're in cahoots.  The one thing both parties should agree on is that as Americans, we pay way too many.  We're paying amazing taxes.  We pay too much in taxes.  How about the fact you're spending it like shitheads?  Right.  God.  How about we agree on that, at least?  Yeah.  I agree with you.  I agree with you with the MSNBC thing.  I know.  It's infuriating to say, no, you're not paying your fair share.  That's crazy.  What's up?  Super Bowl ad under fire, because Career Builders ad features chimps as workers. 
[00:26:30]  Like, who gives a fuck?  Uh-oh.  It looks funny.  And I'll probably get more attention now that everyone's talking about it.  It's a free airplay.  And speaking of football.  Now, it's me, the chimps were having fun.  Yeah.  They look like you're having fun.  Oh, is it animal activists that are fangirling?  I don't know.  Who's mad?  Let's try to find out.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, what were you implying?  I just said I was annoyed that they're showing you on the news that I don't know who's mad.  Who could be mad about that?  Exactly.  No one's mad about it.  The news makes believe people are mad about it. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  They start half this shit.  Chimps are adorable.  They're adorable.  People love a good chimp.  Chicago Zoo is mad.  Oh, okay.  The Chicago Zoo?  Why are they mad?  I thought it was a workers group that didn't like workers being interpreted as a child.  Oh.  Okay.  Look at that.  He's in his suit.  It's hilarious.  Why is the Chicago Zoo mad about this?  Why are they mad?  Zoos are shitty to animals.  I know. 
[00:27:30]  They should shut their mouths.  Leave them in the wild where they can be poached.  Most zoos don't take care of their animals.  They put them in small spaces because, you know, humans are too lazy to walk great distances to look at the animals.  It was M.C. Rove.  That's funny.  I'm M.C. Rove.  I wish he would have grabbed his chest and just fallen into the drum set.  Fucking douchebag.  The officials fear images of the frolicking chimps broadcast worldwide do little to help conservation efforts inaccurately portraying the animals as unthreatened and even as cuddly, harmless pets. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, should we just portray them as horrible testicle ripper offers?  Right.  Wow, yeah.  Because that's what they really are.  God, we need a chimp to work here.  He'll get some shit done for us.  Chimps have been in suits and clothes and looking cuddly for years.  People love a good chimp in a suit.  It's hilarious.  How about him in the little engineer outfit? 
[00:28:30]  What is cuter than a chimpanzee dressed like he's ready to drive a train?  It's fucking adorable.  Who doesn't like that?  I love it.  Let it be.  I wanted a chimp when I was a kid.  Every kid wanted a little monkey.  You watch the little rascal Spanky had one.  I knew a girl that had one.  Yeah?  Yeah, when we were in like kindergarten and grammar school.  Not a chimp, right?  She had like a...  Oh, she had some kind of monkey.  I don't remember.  You don't want to be his uncle.  No, you don't, chimp.  That's funny.  Everybody wanted to go over to her house to check it out.  Yeah.  I was never invited. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  I had a crush on it.  She'd be like, you want to come over to see my monkey?  I was never invited.  Yeah.  It was probably her pussy.  Yeah.  You didn't understand the euphemism.  Yeah, maybe she never had a monkey.  Yeah.  Her chimp mouth.  They're putting their face in her monkey and kissing it.  Oh, I see.  The rumor was she had some kind of monkey.  Look at that monkey.  He's wearing a little striped shirt.  He's wearing a visor because he's playing poker.  And he's smoking a cigarette.  Fucking hilarious.  That's awesome.  That is awesome.  I bet the animal rights activists would have a call with the smoking thing.  Oh, they don't like the smoking monkey. 
[00:29:30]  They don't like the smoking monkey.  But do you ever see a hacking monkey with lung cancer or something?  Never.  They don't smoke that much monkeys.  They really can't buy their own cigarettes.  That's the problem.  You have to feed their addiction.  Monkeys have to bum cigarettes.  What about this one with the gun?  That's adorable.  You like that?  Yeah, look.  Old chimp with a gun.  He looks like he's fucking cute as hell.  He looks like he's focusing.  Well, that's an old chimp.  Wow.  Let's see the old chimp.  Oh, that's just awful.  Look what happens to a chimp.  Wow.  Need some Rogaine. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, my God.  That's horrendous.  It's like anything else.  Who would fuck that?  Oh, boy.  Wow, that's awful.  Poor old guy.  All right, you want to hear the Rachel Maddow thing?  Yeah, let's hear what she's got to say.  Racial illusions accusing Newt Gingrich.  And then stupid Al Sharpton had it.  No, that's once again, of course.  The media accusing a white guy of being raped.  We got it.  Race card.  Cool.  Good.  Let me say something provocative, but I think it's true. 
[00:30:30]  Is that why we keep getting racial illusions from Newt Gingrich?  Newt Gingrich tonight brought back the food stamps president thing.  He's been doing that, bringing that up in Florida.  And then tonight he went to President Obama ought to stop singing, ought to stop being the  entertainer in chief.  Essentially.  Holy shit.  Why is that racial?  Why is that?  I'll tell you why.  Why is that racial?  Because she is a guilty.  Yes.  A guilty pandering cracker bitch.  Just sees racism in everything. 
[00:31:00]  A guilty white woman who would never make that accusation in reverse.  Holy fuck.  But thought about it.  I didn't think that Obama.  No, no.  She's another white person who's seeking Sharpton's approval.  Right.  They're all scared of him.  They all want to be the guy he likes.  It's like, okay, I'll cater to you.  God, I wish I could just read their minds and know exactly what they're really thinking.  Because you know what it is?  It's horrible racism. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  So Obama decided to sing a song and now Newt's making fun of it.  Who cares?  Yeah, but all of a sudden it becomes racist.  Basically saying, look, instead of singing and entertaining people, maybe we should take  care of some things that are happening in this country.  That's what I got from it.  I didn't get a racial thing.  It becomes racist.  When you're a groveling white lady.  Wow, Rachel Maddow.  You suck.  She stinks.  You fucking suck.  Well, is there more to it?  I mean, he's right here.  Oh, yeah.  I just had to stop it there because I can't believe this is what it's about.  The entertainer in chief.  Essentially caricaturing him in a way that almost calls out to minstrelsy. 
[00:32:00]  What?  No, you're making that leap.  No one made that assumption until you just fucking said it out of your dyke looking mouth.  She stinks, man.  You suck.  Wow.  You suck.  Wow.  Minstrelsy?  Really?  Wow.  Is that even a word?  Minstrelsy?  I like that.  Are you kidding me?  I like a minstrelsy.  Let's tell you the truth.  They all become a C on their minstrelsy.  And I think Gingrich stinks.  But for him to criticize the president like that and say, stop being the singing or entertainment president. 
[00:32:30]  Did they criticize Clinton on that because he played on Arsenio?  Well, I thought the whole comment by Newt Gingrich was a stretch to begin with.  You know what I mean?  But basically trying to say, look, you need to work on the country and not be entertaining people.  That's a stretch.  The guy had a moment at a dumb, what was it, a fundraiser?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And he sang Al Green, yeah.  He sang one fucking line.  It took ten seconds. 
[00:33:00]  And to all you guys that are called out Fox all the time, you're right.  It's biased.  Wow, this is bad.  But this doesn't get called out except by most people.  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  No one would put it in this context except for these fucking bedwetting left-wing shitheads like Rachel Maddow and her ilk.  Sitting there begging for his approval.  Yeah.  Begging.  Just suck his dick.  Begging for him to validate her as one of the good white people.  Well, here comes Al. 
[00:33:30]  Al's got something to say.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  When is the last time has anybody ever suggested racism that that twat Sharpton has ever goes,  nah, it doesn't seem like it.  Right.  It literally is Pavlov's dog.  All you've got to say is racism.  He's like, hey, you're right.  Yes, it is.  I haven't looked into it, but it is racism.  All you've got to say, I 100% guarantee he agrees.  Him in a way that almost calls out to minstrelsy.  Yeah.  I mean, Reverend Al.  I think you're right, which is why I brought Herman Cain back in the conversation, because he had no problem with Mr. Cain. 
[00:34:00]  But I think that he is clearly going after what he considers a Southern mentality with racial illusions and always wrapped around when he refers to the president.  Oh, gosh.  Shut the fuck up, you liar.  Oh, my God, you stink.  You fucking, Tawana Brawley, Tawana Brawley, Tawana Brawley.  Oh, my God, you stink.  Those Greek homos.  Yeah.  Greek homos.  Fuck you.  Is that subtle enough?  Greek homos? 
[00:34:30]  I'm going to Twitter Al Sharpton and mention Greek homos.  Yes.  Why don't you do that, Jimmy?  Yes, I will.  He might have even forgot to mention it last night.  No one should ever let that cocksucker forget the things he said.  Greek homos, they the ones that eating the cock.  They come home, they got cum all over their face.  Like the GOP.  They got the cum over their face and go, you know, I'm not the one that's been sucking dick.  But they the ones with the cum all over their face.  They been sucking the balls dry. 
[00:35:00]  They the ones been licking their ass.  Greek homos.  What is any possible reason you could feel that this kind of statement could...  Fuck, I can't look at Imus having to kiss his ass.  I'm sorry, I said that.  Why would he come to you?  Reverend Al, I apologize.  Yeah, yeah.  The moment could be just forgiven and overlooked.  Well, I'm going to play some cuts from Al Sharpton and explain why he has the moral authority to lead the effort to fire anybody based on his past remarks. 
[00:35:30]  David, thank you, yes.  By the way, Sean Hannity got this from us.  You know that, right?  The only nigga in the news.  The only nigga can talk.  What?  Don't cover him.  Don't talk to him.  Because you've got the only nigga problem.  Because, you know, if a black man stood up next to you, they would see you for the horror that you really are. 
[00:36:00]  White folks was in the cave when we had built empires.  Really?  Right.  We learned to admire them, but they knew to admire us.  We built pyramids where Donald Trump ever knew what architecture was.  No, you didn't.  We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics.  Didn't even have a wheel.  Before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around.  Greek homos.  In the universe.  And we were going to buy some kind of sandwich chicken.  Didn't the Chinaman come in and throw some hot sauce in return. 
[00:36:30]  And dip it down.  And you stand out and buy that.  Korea, sell us watermelon.  We need watermelon all our lives.  But they're going to come cut it up, put it in a bucket with a rubber band around it.  And we're going to buy it like it's something we didn't know.  He's killing.  It's like Def Jam.  It's like Def Jam.  That's great.  Just take Socrates and relegate it to Greek homo.  That makes you sound real intelligent.  Philosopher.  You know, instead of researching what Socrates said. 
[00:37:00]  Greek homo.  That's the guy a lot of people, a lot of white people in media are scared of.  Yeah.  That's fucking idiot.  He's a shock jock.  Right.  Admitting that black people eat watermelon, by the way.  But if you're white and say that, oh boy, he'll get on your fucking case.  We've been eating watermelon for years.  He stinks.  But Maddow in this situation is worse by even trying to go there.  Just sucking up to him.  Just begging for him to approve of her.  Begging for him to co-sign for her as one of the decent white people. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, look at me.  I'm saying that he's racist, right?  Yeah.  Isn't that good, Reverend Al?  How bad does she want to wear boys' clothes on TV, too?  They have to dolly her up and make her...  She's abominable.  Well, they have to make her slightly female.  Yeah.  She doesn't walk around the streets looking like that.  Minstrelsy.  She wants to be a boy.  Minstrelsy.  Minstrelsy.  No one watches her show, by the way.  Her show is bombing.  It's bombing horrifically.  It's bombing?  There was actually on Jeopardy, they put a picture of her up and said, this host of MSNBC 
[00:38:00]  or whatever the fuck it is, and no one got the answer.  No one knew her fucking name with her picture up there on Jeopardy.  That's her, by the way.  She wants to wear boys' clothes so bad on TV, but MSNBC said, nope, you can't.  If you want this gig, you got to fucking be a...  That's great.  She yearns for a dick.  Not one in her, one on her.  To be a bit more feminine.  Wrapped in a flag with that man fucking face. 
[00:38:30]  She looks like Spike Ferriston.  Yeah.  Do you remember we had Spike on?  She looks like Spike Ferriston.  Wow.  I know you're not a big Obama fan, but...  It was just a quick moment.  It was just a quick, dumb little moment.  Oh, yeah.  That doesn't even come into play as far as not liking him as president.  No, it's fine.  I think it's...  I like that shit because it shows people as being, you know, more human than...  But Newt was desperate going there, but he certainly wasn't going racial with the thing.  No, it's just a throwaway. 
[00:39:00]  He's basically saying, look, this guy should be concentrating on America more than entertaining people.  Anytime the president gets a little press on doing something that's a little out of the ordinary,  like singing or fucking dancing around or something like that, the press grabs it,  and then their opposition will use it and say, well, instead of doing that, he should be doing this.  Right.  It's common.  It's been done for years.  Doing it for years.  But then to make the stretch and say it's racial.  Racial.  Racial illusions. 
[00:39:30]  Stop it.  That's dumb.  Ultra libs.  That is just a dumb one, Rachel Maddow.  Look up Rachel Maddow's yearbook picture, I guess.  Is that it?  Oh, God.  You can tell she's a lesbian there, though.  She's got long blonde hair.  But you can tell.  But, yeah.  Sometimes you can just tell.  She has the gay face.  We'll linger longer.  Wait, where's that from again?  She does.  It's a mess with the gay face.  Oh, right, right.  The gay face. 
[00:40:00]  He could spot gay people because they had the gay face.  Spaz, probably the dumbest person to do our show.  And the reason why he was dumb, he had such a thing going.  Oh, yeah.  And he didn't want to do it anymore.  Didn't want to do it.  Didn't want to be the character.  But he wasn't being a character.  No, it was him.  Basically, what he was telling people was, I don't want to be myself anymore.  Yeah.  The shit he came up with, to this day, was amazing.  To this day, by the way, when the news hits on a subject that he touched on. 
[00:40:30]  I always think like, oh my God, I think he got that right.  Like they were talking about using microwaves.  Right.  And moisture absorbers in hurricanes to stop hurricanes on the news.  And I'm like, holy shit, fucking Spaz came up with that.  It was amazing.  The guy comes to me in air one day.  He's red hot.  Yeah.  The listeners, you know, loved him.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously they were laughing at him.  At him, yes.  But some were laughing with him.  That was funny.  But he was massively huge. 
[00:41:00]  He comes to me in air one day.  He goes, uh, I don't want to be called Spaz anymore.  I want to be called Kevin.  Kevin.  Just Kevin.  I just want to do the job.  And they were like, there's no room for you as Kevin here.  Did a woman get to him?  I don't know what it was, man.  And then all of a sudden he-  Who, Beba?  Then he hands in his resignation.  I'm like, what are you doing?  And then the worst part of it all was, uh, like, we still would have had him on occasionally  or phone calls or anything because people ask, why did he drop off the face of the earth?  Because then he tried to sue us or something. 
[00:41:30]  Did he?  Yeah, remember?  Another fucking bitter asshole.  Yeah.  So we were like, well, all bets are off.  So many bitter assholes after they leave this show.  All bets are off.  Why did he try to sue for what?  I don't know.  I don't know that one.  Yeah, it was something.  I don't know if I ever met him.  I might have met him once or twice at events, but I was-  Was he before you?  Spaz was, yeah.  Hey, Beba.  Holy fuck.  Oh, he was very early on.  Yeah, Spaz is before me.  It was very early on.  Holy fuck.  Do we have a Spaz bit we could play going at a break?  You got anything good, E?  Beba.  I don't think I have any of this stuff in the system. 
[00:42:00]  No Spaz.  Go on YouTube.  I got, yeah, I mean, I have stuff here.  If you want to do Insult Spaz Day or Spaz Week in Review, World Wars and JFK.  I like some of that shit.  Like when he hit on the news and his takes on things.  We need a basic one for the people that maybe don't know who this guy is.  Get like, yeah, one of the things Week in Review is good or-  Just another intern that became just fucking gold.  I mean, this kid was gold. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it was all real.  It was really him.  I'm trying to make sure we find something that's really good.  Oh, these are long, man.  We want something short.  Oh, yeah.  How about just a minute?  I'm just curious.  I almost don't even remember his voice.  What about the one about, yeah, controlling the weather?  Control, yeah, weather control.  Or the famous giant mosquito that a lot of people remember.  Giant mosquito has got encephalitis.  Type in giant mosquito, see if anything pops up with Spaz.  I'm sure.  Giant mosquito.  Encephalitis, he called it?  Encephalitis. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it might be in here.  It just says Spaz 1.1 of 3.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Is that how you say it?  Spaz.  Spaz.  You know what?  Could someone maybe listen to a few of these, get a good one, maybe edit it quickly, too,  and we'll put it on after the break?  Yeah.  Next break there, Sam.  Yeah.  Or, I mean, we've got a 20-second one here.  Spaz lets one too many bad callers through and has to drink out of the toilet.  No, that's like, no, we made him do crazy shit, too. 
[00:43:30]  It should be more of like a topic that he's talking about, commentary on.  I think, Ant, the Spaz 1 of 3, 2 of 3, and 3 of 3.  Yeah, that's probably.  Those are going to be the classic ones, but.  Yeah.  Let's hear real quick.  See if this one.  But anyway, and the listeners are pretty disgusting.  Oh, this is live.  That's live.  That's a live event.  I don't know.  Maybe someone could go through and try to find.  Try to find the giant mosquito.  That's classic Spaz.  Giant mosquito's great, yeah.  And then controlling the weather was classic Spaz, too.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  And then it turns out that it's an actual theory they're working on. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Remember robot doctors in the hospital?  That was another good one.  And then I started reading shit a few years ago that, you know, in hospitals they're using  these mechanical robots to make the incisions.  And it's like, I don't think robot.  But he would go so off.  He was like, I don't think robots should be in the operating room because let's say they  run amok and start going crazy in the hospital.  Like I'm thinking they're literally robots with legs and arms.  He was very similar to Carl.  Carl from Idiot Abroad. 
[00:44:30]  Exactly.  From an idiot abroad.  Yes.  He was very similar to that guy.  They probably had the same fucking whatever it is.  Same whatever issue.  Whatever it is in your head.  Some issue.  It makes you like that.  How long was he on the show for?  God, maybe.  Was it?  I would say two years.  Two years?  Yeah, two years sounds about right.  You were at N.E.W. what?  Four years?  So maybe two.  Not that long.  You did the last, what?  Two years?  I guess the last two or maybe the last year and a half.  I don't remember.  You only did a year and a half?  Maybe there's more.  Because I wasn't paid for a year.  Damn.  Jesus.  It was okay. 
[00:45:00]  You promised me I'd get paid and I did.  I was plugging gigs.  You're like, we'll get you some money.  And you guys did.  It took a while.  But it was, you know.  I bought you dinner every once in a while.  It was fine, dude.  I wasn't worried about the money.  I wasn't even thinking about it.  It did help gigs a little bit.  It helped a lot.  It helped a lot.  My pussy intake went way up.  You can't put a price on that, right?  No.  Technically, you can't.  No, we saved you some money, though, is what I'm saying.  Yes, I did.  In that department. 
[00:45:30]  Didn't have to, like, go into the bank account as much.  It was amazing.  All right.  We'll break.  We'll try to find some.  Oh, you found one?  No.  It's the same one.  All right.  You guys will try to figure it out?  Yeah.  All right.  And I want to discuss that thing that's on the counter.  Yeah, who the fuck is that?  And Sam, you know what?  I'm going to put you in a tough spot.  I want a SiriusXM Super Bowl update after the break.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Because as you can tell, we're not in Indianapolis.  I'm not going.  No, you're still here.  And I notice as the days go by, there's less and less people here. 
[00:46:00]  So they're sending a lot of people there.  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot the Super Bowl was coming up even.  Really?  Yeah, man.  I totally forgot.  What do you got?  I want New England badly.  So do I.  I hate the Giants.  So do I.  Not a popular thing to say in New York, but I want the Pats.  Yeah, I'm rooting for one team to lose.  I'm glad to root either way, though.  It's nice to have somebody to root for or against.  Well, I was talking to some fellow Jets fans, and they're like, this is our worst nightmare.  It's the worst case.  Yeah.  It's just the worst thing that could happen. 
[00:46:30]  To have the Giants and the Pats in the Super Bowl.  So in the end, you know, Jets fans don't win either way.  But you got to pick a team, and I go Pats.  I think it would be really cool to see, you know, Brady win over the Giants after what  happened to the Pats in their undefeated season.  I think it would be better to see him lose.  Oh, I know.  Again.  That would hurt.  It would be hilarious.  You think it would be hilarious?  It would be hilarious.  I don't know.  I think the Giants should be favored.  Nah, Brady's fucking...  I don't think the Pats had an amazing year. 
[00:47:00]  They started peaking at the right time.  But he's Tom Brady.  He really is the fucking...  Can't cut him out.  Oh, that guy's amazing.  He really is an amazing quarterback.  Yeah.  It annoys me.  Oh, and we also have JWoww and Snooki coming in today.  Finally.  Finally, they're showing up to say hi.  Didn't they just...  They just got denied a permit to shoot, too.  And Hoboken.  Hoboken.  Why?  Why would Hoboken do that?  Hoboken.  I don't know.  Hoboken!  That's what Sharpton would call it.  I just Twittered him, too, by the way.  What was your tweet? 
[00:47:30]  It wasn't a particularly funny one.  It was...  He's one of the only guys I hashtag...  I mean, I at mention when I discuss him.  Because normally I'll blast people, but I just use their...  You know.  Right.  I don't usually mention them.  I do the at.  Nah.  Just so it hurts a little more.  I don't care if they see it or not.  I really don't.  It just...  With him, it was very impressive with Rachel Maddow.  You forgot to mention Socrates and the Greek homos.  And then hashtag racist and hypocrite.  Bravo.  Good one.  Good.  Fucking creep.  Never let him forget that shit. 
[00:48:00]  Nope.  Believe me.  He...  No way he likes reading that shit on Twitter.  There's no...  Nobody wants to be constantly reminded.  Especially when you're trying to get this credibility.  Right.  When you're trying for political credibility.  He's got it on MSNBC.  They all, you know, kiss his ass.  They're a terrible network, though.  No one cares about it.  It's really tough to watch.  Terrible.  Rachel Maddow.  Like a nanny.  They're telling you what to do on that channel.  It's terrible.  All right.  Let's make love.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to rock your girl. 
[00:48:30]  Opinion 3 Show.  Don't play so quick to walk away.  Dance me.  I want to rock your body.  Please play.  Dance me.  You don't have to ditch her.  Walk away.  Dance me.  Let me rock you.  To the break.  Hey.  Dance me.  I don't mean no harm.  Just want to rock your girl.  You can move.  You can move.  You can move, but be calm. 
[00:49:00]  Let's go.  Let's give it up, girl.  See, it appears to me.  You like the way I move.  I tell you what I'm gonna do.  Put you close and share my groove.  So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more.  And you all can meet me in the middle of the door.  So the air is thick.  It's smelling right.  So you pass to the left and you sail to the right.  Don't play so quick to walk away.  Dance me.  I want to rock your body.  Please stay. 
[00:49:30]  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  How's the castle?  It's getting there.  Yeah.  He rocks a homeowner.  He's a homeowner.  When are we gonna be invited over for a housewarming?  Yeah, what are you waiting for?  As soon as I get furniture in the place.  Put the housewarming and tells a fire.  Oh, wait.  See, that's not nice.  Well, he's in bed.  That's not nice.  So we're getting topical, huh?  Castle Nagel. 
[00:50:00]  We're here at Castle Nagel.  Where you can see there's a big refrigerator.  That's all I have.  Oh, there is.  Oh, there is.  Stainless steel.  What kind of bathroom do you get?  Do you have anything in the bathroom?  The what?  Do you get anything cool like a tub or a standing shower?  The master bathroom has a big jacuzzi tub and a standing shower separate.  Oh, cool.  Wow.  Wait, what'd you say?  There's a master.  It's standing.  No, what'd you say?  Jacuzzi tub? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, how big is it?  I think it fits two people comfortably.  Two normal people?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I get it.  I missed my opportunity.  I had to have him repeat it.  Fat guy tub.  There you go.  I failed miserably.  I was going to say, where's your wife going to be?  Oh.  Standing shower.  So we're getting topical.  I think this is Justin Timberlake.  I think that it is.  Huh?  I don't know. 
[00:51:00]  This is an easy one.  Is it the Jan Jackson thing?  Ah.  Yeah, this is the song.  Huh?  Yeah.  This was the song they were doing?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  She just pulled her fucking top down right there.  The nip slip.  Yeah.  Eight years ago?  Eight years ago?  Eight years ago?  Eight years ago.  So that was right before we went back on radio, huh?  Wow.  And started the whole decline of radio.  And everything.  No, I think we might have had something to do with that.  I mean, I don't like talking about it, but oops. 
[00:51:30]  This was just another nail in the gap.  You may have started it, but I think this was the catalyst that got it all going.  Yeah, obviously this was a lot bigger, but when this came out, they kind of mentioned  us alongside this incident for a while.  Yeah, they just decided that everything was out of control between what we did and this.  It was crazy.  Well, once again, you got to blame the media, because then they played it a million fucking  times.  Yeah.  And I'll say it again.  I had a Super Bowl party, and everyone was staring at the TV, and this is what I heard. 
[00:52:00]  What was that?  Yeah, what was that?  They really weren't even sure.  What was that?  Oh, thank God they showed it a thousand times.  They were confused, though.  It wasn't like...  And no one was shocked.  There were kids watching.  They didn't run away crying.  Yeah.  It was a...  What was that?  That's all it was.  It was so fast.  And because she had that thing around her nip, you weren't even sure if it was a nipple.  Right, right.  You weren't sure.  It was like, what was it?  What?  Right.  What?  Everyone was confused.  And this is what the media does, which we've learned since. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  We had to take it and make it way bigger than it has to be.  Yeah.  Way the fuck bigger.  They invent their own problems at this point.  Oh, yeah.  For the sake of ratings.  So what happened with that?  Did CBS end up paying, or are they still fighting that?  I think they're still fighting it, like...  Oh, my God.  Maybe they're not fighting, but the FCC has taken a big hit in court recently.  I think the FCC is eventually going to get fucking wiped.  You think?  They really are shit, yeah.  Yeah.  And that was a song they were doing.  I didn't know.  All right.  So that's a good day. 
[00:53:00]  I thought it was a good one.  You didn't think so, Sam?  No.  Why?  What's the difference between playing the anniversary...  If it's the anniversary of something, it's the same song.  The anniversary.  It's like if it was Justin Timberlake's birthday.  Huh?  You knew it.  None of us knew it.  It's his most famous song.  Exactly.  That's the beauty of me not knowing it.  I thought Cry Me a River was his famous song.  That's more famous than Cry Me a River.  That one was.  Yeah.  Thank God I don't like Justin Timberlake, then, because I don't know this.  I only like...  Baby Got Back.  That's the only one I know.  Baby Got Back?  What is that, Dan?  That's Sir Mix-A-Lot. 
[00:53:30]  That's Sir Mix-A-Lot.  No, wait.  Oh, no.  This is...  What's it called?  This is Sexy Back?  Sexy Back?  Yeah, Sexy Back.  Baby Got Back.  Of course you like Baby's Got Back.  This one I like.  Yeah.  This is what you got to dance for.  Bring the warm up.  You're dancing, Jimmy.  Hey, congrats to David Letterman, who will never have us back on the show, unfortunately.  Oh, well. 
[00:54:00]  Because someone got in the way down the hall, made a call.  Called in a personal favor?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a known fact.  It was told to me by a person that will remain nameless.  All right.  So what...  About 30 years ago, though, Letterman premiered on NBC.  Wow.  Yeah, we did really well in Letterman.  And then someone...  We know who.  Howard himself or someone very close to Howard called in a fucking favor.  That is a fact.  That did happen.  Because you remember you were having trouble getting rebooked. 
[00:54:30]  It was like...  You're getting to run around as to a date.  Yeah, no, we're gonna...  And then as soon as you do...  They ran to us.  They ran to us and said, wow, that went so well.  Can we book you again?  And we're like, yeah.  And then all of a sudden it got shady.  Like, there was a date, then they took it off the table, and then all this shit went on.  And then years later, you know, someone told me the story.  And this person is very reliable.  Extremely reliable.  What is this, the Ron and Fez show?  They do this?  Well, they just play music.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  They have somebody that pops the music on no matter what they're talking about.  This is the original Late Night.  Oh.  Wow.  It's going old school.  But, man, that sucks.  God, we never did any of that shit.  Never called in favors.  Yeah, we never had anybody call in favors, too.  Nah, I guess you're right.  We suck.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  Letterman, happy 30th anniversary.  Still like a show, even though some dirty shit went on. 
[00:55:30]  I haven't watched in so fucking long, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's been quite a while since I've even watched.  Uh, Super Bowl.  Oh.  Sam, do we have a Super Bowl update?  A SiriusXM Super Bowl update?  Well, I have a list, yeah.  A list of people that are going.  Yeah.  And on that list, not the Opie and Anthony show.  For the 17th year in a row.  Yes.  I know that involves a lot of radio companies, but for 17 straight years, we've been shut  out of the Super Bowl.  We've been denied access.  And I think we've been a pretty successful radio show over the years. 
[00:56:00]  Sure.  And then you hear about these other successful radio shows, and it's a no-brainer to send  them to the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  How do we not get that done once in 17 years?  Well, I heard that we aren't going this year, and it was a favor that was done for  us, because we wouldn't have liked to go to the Super Bowl and go to Radio Row, I guess.  And then we look dumbfounded, because we're like...  We're like, what?  Can we at least have been asked?  Right.  No, no.  Even to ask you would have been insulting. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  But they don't mind insulting us with everything else, so I don't buy that excuse.  Yeah, yeah.  Every day here is an insult.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a few things going on.  Someone dropped the ball.  That would be Gary.  Gary dropped the ball.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  Because you started the sentence as if to say, somebody dropped the ball, like I won't  mention names.  And then the second part of the sentence was the name of the person.  Oh, really?  Yes.  It's humiliating for that person.  I'm starting to think I might have just a tinge of, like, Asperger's or something. 
[00:57:00]  You think so?  Yeah, is that the social thing where you don't understand?  Are you really just thinking you have Asperger's?  You think I might have a little bit?  I know you do.  I know you got the Asperger's.  A lot of it.  Exactly.  You think?  Yes, Patty's.  Yes.  Fuck, man.  What is that?  Like, where socially you don't understand?  Well, you don't just know that it's not appropriate to talk in any...  Well, you don't talk close to someone's face.  Like, DL was saying that.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was just saying...  I like to just be a little shocking.  We all do, but...  Hurtful is the word. 
[00:57:30]  Hurtful.  There's a line.  Yeah.  But I don't do this in my everyday life.  Yeah, but it's his everyday life.  Yeah.  Fuck, Gary.  See what I did there?  I got a reaction from you.  And that makes me very, very, very good inside.  You're like a blackout douche.  Like, you know, some people drink and don't remember what they do.  Like, you don't remember when you're like a douche and you'll come out of it and go,  What happened?  I'm a nice person.  Well, I know I'm nice when these mics aren't on.  Yes.  That's what I bring...  That's what I tell myself every day.  Fuck, Gary.  You're a very different social... 
[00:58:00]  You're a very fun guy socially and a gentleman socially.  I am a gentleman.  Yeah, you are.  A gentleman.  But that's boring on the radio.  Fuck that.  I like a gentleman on the radio.  I like this one better.  You do?  Yeah, I like you on the air better.  It is two different people.  It's fun, though, on the air.  It's unpredictable.  But I don't understand what's so outrageous about him saying,  Fuck Gary.  Yeah, exactly.  That's an easy one.  Jesus Christ, when you've worked here, I think it's...  That's an easy one.  It's second nature.  See, he just said it indirectly.  Exactly.  See, he knows. 
[00:58:30]  Because you got a guy that supposedly, and I'm being serious, runs the channel,  like makes sure everything is running smoothly, and the guy can't even come up with any idea  for a Super Bowl.  That's true.  We should be at the Super Bowl, and if we're not at the Super Bowl, we should have at least  given away a trip, a couple tickets.  Imagine what we could do with a couple tickets to the Super Bowl.  Oh, yeah.  We'd have some good time with some...  We would make good radio out of it, and we would get some good press.  Yeah.  But that thought doesn't even enter his stupid head. 
[00:59:00]  That egghead of his.  Oh, God.  Stupid head.  He could have just...  You did two insults about his head in that sentence.  Who cares?  What are you going to do?  And then, I'm trying to keep under control.  Yeah.  I really am.  This is me under control.  I'm really trying.  I understand that it could be a hindrance to the radio show when I bitch all the time,  but I'm trying.  Right.  But the fact is, now it's Wednesday, and I'm seeing less and less people here, which  means this company had a lot of money to send people to the Super Bowl. 
[00:59:30]  They're shipping out.  That's what it means.  They're shipping out.  They're shipping out.  Wait till tomorrow.  Really?  More people.  Ghost Town.  I say we take Friday off and say, fuck them all.  Nice.  Get ready for the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  So, what's the SiriusXM Super Bowl update?  Update.  Sam Roberts.  Okay.  Well, various members of the sales and managerial staff.  And why do they have to go again?  To broker deals.  Like, what deals?  Like, what relationship? 
[01:00:00]  What are they going to walk up to alcohol companies and go, hey, we'd appreciate it if  you continue doing nothing on the show that is exactly your demo.  Right.  Right.  Right.  It's good.  Stephen Singer.  What kind of salespeople do they got if they can't figure out a beer company for the Opie  and Anthony show?  They should call Stephen Singer from Indiana.  Hey, Stephen, guess who we are.  Let's do some business.  You remember all the live reads for beer companies where we had to, like, we had to  fucking, we had to work that shit to make it sound like it was the greatest beer ever.  And then 20 minutes later, we're talking about the competitor. 
[01:00:30]  Another beer.  Yeah.  It was juggling beer ads.  We had four.  Yeah.  At one point, we had four beer companies, Jim, and we even had the St. Louis guys fly  in and take me and Ant to lunch.  Oh, it was amazing.  They wanted to do a lot of shit with us.  They were excited to be involved with the Opie and Anthony show.  Why have we not even been approached by sales for beer ads?  It ain't sex for Sam anymore.  That was so many, so many years ago.  Yeah.  And there would have been some discussion.  No, it's, it's, uh, I'll tell you why, because the sales department sucks. 
[01:01:00]  Well, they're, they're going to the Super Bowl.  It just stinks.  I don't know.  But they're going down there to schmooze who?  Yeah.  Potential clients.  Oh, boy.  Current clients.  Make sure they get, uh, future business.  But wouldn't it be more important to have the Opie and Anthony show starring Jim Norton  down there and, and give the people good radio?  And, and then show the clients the show.  Like, holy shit, look what these guys could do at a big event.  Oh.  Well, you know what?  I'm not going to be so hard on them because I know they're going to come back from the 
[01:01:30]  Super Bowl after all that work that they put in.  Yeah.  And have a lot more, uh, opportunities for us as far as sponsors go.  How do we get inside?  We're always looking inside.  I want to be inside.  Fucking no.  I don't want to be looking through these fucking windows anymore.  Yeah.  I want the key.  That special key.  That lets you in.  That just lets you in.  Well, a lot of times, when you beat on the door so hard, sometimes a gentle pull will get 
[01:02:00]  it open.  Nice.  Gymspiration.  Really well said.  Gymspiration.  It's been a while.  I like that one.  All right.  So you got sales douches going down there to schmooze clients.  That would be beating on the door.  There's a gentle pull.  The gentle pull.  And executives.  And executives.  What are they going to do down there?  They got to make sure the on-air product is working.  Oh, right.  They got to make sure the sales department is working.  They got to make sure the SiriusXM representatives are representing the company.  I can read between the lines. 
[01:02:30]  Basically, what you're saying is they need to get away from their wives.  Oh.  And maybe hire some talent.  Oh.  I understand.  Well.  All right.  Who's going?  As far as air talent goes.  From NFL Radio.  Bob Papa.  Solomon Wilcox.  Adam Schein.  Rich Gannon.  Gil Brandt.  Tim Ryan.  Pat Kerwin.  Derek Brooks.  Vic Carucci.  Howard Balzer. 
[01:03:00]  And Jim Miller.  Plus producers.  Plus producers.  Now, NFL Radio.  It's hard to argue that.  Right.  But you can't knock two of those guys out to give us a spot?  It's a lot of guys.  All right.  It's NFL, though.  So I'll even give them all of them.  All of them.  All of them.  That's a lot of people, though, Ant.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  It looks like about ten people plus their producers.  You got to have a lot of people for NFL Radio.  You got to be like,  Hey, yeah.  Zampats.  Eleven people and their producers.  And their producers.  From one channel. 
[01:03:30]  Include the guys who do the wrestling show, Busted Open, who will be broadcasting live.  That's stupid.  See, now you're rubbing it in.  That's stupid.  Wrestling guys are going, is basically what you're trying to say.  People don't want to hear about...  It's like, football, football, football.  Where's the relief?  Where's some wrestling?  I need some professional wrestling analysis.  I don't think so.  No?  Just one time in 17 years.  Yeah.  You don't think the Friday...  One fucking time.  The Friday before the Super Bowl, people aren't going to be dying for a pro wrestling show live from Indianapolis.  No! 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Who else?  From Mad Dog Radio.  Of course, Mad Dog will be there.  Ah.  And his night guy, Dino Costa, who's tried to get on this show.  Who is he?  Dino Costa.  I don't think he should be on.  I don't think he should be going.  Who else?  Larry the Cable Guy will be doing, I think, either a one-hour show or a two-hour show.  He doesn't even work here.  They hired him to go to...  Are they hiring people to go to the Super Bowl now?  Oh, my God.  And represent SiriusXM?  Blue Collar Radio. 
[01:04:30]  He doesn't work there.  Oh, a one-hour show.  One-hour show.  Oh, my God.  They're sending him for a one-hour show.  He's doing a one-hour show on Radio Row.  Radio Row.  Radio Row.  Well, you know.  Well, they told us that we didn't think he'd want to be part of Radio Row.  That's where all the big names are going.  But meanwhile, everyone's going to be there.  All the big names.  They don't want us to be a part of Radio Row.  No.  That's what it is.  Christ.  Rosie O'Donnell will be doing a show from Radio Row.  She talks to dykes.  How many dykes fucking watch the Super Bowl? 
[01:05:00]  Don't they?  No.  I don't think so.  I know they like the WNBA, but I don't think they like the – I don't think there's a big  fan base in the NFL.  Rosie.  Why is Rosie going?  Mark says hi.  We'll be broadcasting from –  Ugh, that dumb name.  The Super Bowl.  Radio Row.  I don't know him, but that name has got to go.  He works on the comedy channel.  He's a nice guy, but his name is horrible.  So if he walked up to us, how would it go?  Um, what do you say?  Hey, Mark says hi. 
[01:05:30]  You go hi.  When you say hi, my name's Mark says hi.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm Mark says hi.  Oh, it's like a loop.  Oh, stop it.  It's like a loop of awfulness.  Yeah.  How do you get out of it?  Hey, guys, I'm Mark says hi.  Guys, I'm Mark says hi.  When do you get a chance to say hello in there?  Because you're stuck in the loop, like Jimmy said.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, that's horrible.  Higher Mark says hi, I'm Mark says hi, I'm Mark says hi, I'm Mark says hi.  Oh, my goodness.  It's like a tie going down a big Mark says hi, Hill. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  But he'll, I guess, be hosting stuff for Raw Dog Comedy from the Super Bowl.  Did Gary even have a conversation about the Super Bowl with anybody?  I know he asked us, and we said yes, and that was the last we heard.  If I remember, Eric brought it up, and what were you, like, months ago?  I brought it up, like, over the summer, like I've done for the last couple of years.  Over the summer?  That's a great time to bring it up.  Yeah.  What was your idea?  About, hey, oh, and I still want to go to the Super Bowl. 
[01:06:30]  We should start planning this.  And then what did they say?  If you wore your Goodyear shirt, it would be a problem.  Oh.  Oh, blimp.  All right, well, Jimmy doesn't want to go.  No, I'm sorry.  Oh, we rock.  No, I do.  Sensitive, you rock.  But they were like, okay, well, we still have time.  That's a bit far out.  And then it never gets brought up again.  It's still far out, right?  Are you guys going to get in trouble?  It's still a bit far out.  Are you guys going to get in trouble talking about this with us? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  You're getting in trouble, right?  More meetings.  I didn't do anything.  What am I going to do?  They get in trouble.  Say that again.  They get in trouble for feeding us this info.  Feeding?  They don't want these guys feeding us this stuff.  No.  They don't want these guys wiling us up.  No, why should these guys tell us shit that is said that directly impacts us and this  program?  These guys should tell us everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They absolutely should tell us everything.  How about we should have been told about the Super Bowl?  And we should have been told that we'd be on Radio Row. 
[01:07:30]  And would that be okay with us?  If it is, we'll send you.  If not, we won't.  If not, maybe we can make an alternative arrangement for some place.  But if that's not possible, do you want us to pursue this anyway?  That would have been the conversation I have.  Or I'm going to get you a trip to the Super Bowl you could give away.  So you could do some good radio with that.  Maybe do a live broadcast to pick the winner.  Or, and I'm saying maybe it's a possibility, throwing a huge O&A Super Bowl party.  That too would have been a biggie. 
[01:08:00]  Larry the Cable Guy, Rosie, Mark says hi.  Covino and Rich will be there.  And this is what, by the way, I like Rich.  I like both of these guys.  I saw Rich in the men's room yesterday.  And he goes, you know, yeah.  He goes, we're low maintenance.  Because we were saying, how come they're going?  And it's like, but it's not a reflection.  It's like, we like those guys.  It's not a reflection on them.  Oh, yeah, no, we're not trashing them.  No, it's almost like, why aren't we going as well?  Not instead of them.  Yeah, we're more, way madder at the company.  No, no, no.  Sway's going.  Did you touch each other's cocks in the bathroom?  He's in good shape, and I comment, and I'm like, god damn. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, in the bathroom, that's always good.  Comment on a man's shape.  And Sway, who's, and we like Sway.  We actually get along with him, our neighbor.  Yeah, he's worth more than you guys.  He's only, uh.  Remember the auction?  Yeah, that's right.  And he's only been here, what, three or four months?  Three or four months?  Six months.  Yeah.  It's the official time.  Six months, good enough for a Super Bowl ticket.  We've been here, um, pushing seven and a half years.  Yeah.  Can you believe that, dude?  That long?  When you say that?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Seven and a half fucking years. 
[01:09:00]  How many of those years did you go to the Super Bowl?  Jesus Christ.  You know the answer, Sam.  It's like a manslaughter rep.  Isn't it true that they're taking people from Fez, around a Fez's show?  There's rumors.  Yeah.  What's that rumor?  No.  I heard somebody.  It's like Sam now.  He's trying to figure out how to phrase that.  You totally fucked him.  It's all rumors and...  You totally fucked Sam.  What are you hearing?  I heard that maybe...  No, I didn't.  He could have just...  Do you understand that he can't help himself either? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Because all he had to say was, I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, okay.  I can't lie.  I don't have it in me.  Right.  Oh, is that what are you, Vulcan?  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, guys.  The whale movie.  The commercial's on TV again.  I looked into the booth.  Oh, the whale movie's going to be terrific.  A whale on the board.  Big miracle.  Yeah, what's the rumor you're hearing?  Well, I heard.  Ronnie's losing a guy?  Yeah, it could be untrue.  But I've heard that there will be one of Ronnie's guys going to help in a managerial. 
[01:10:00]  Now, why would that be?  What does that mean?  A managerial...  Like he's going to assist somebody?  That's correct.  Who's he going to assist?  Who needs an assistant down at the Super Bowl?  And what is his job going to be?  Yeah.  What is whose job going to be?  The guy that's going to...  Whoever this guy is.  I don't even know who it is.  Well, I think that guy's job, he's probably one of the higher-ups.  Zito?  I heard it's Zito.  I heard some behind-the-scenes shit, too.  Well, listen.  It's not going to be Pepper Hicks, is it? 
[01:10:30]  He screams management assistant.  What does Zito do for Ron and Fez?  He's their producer.  It's him and Chris Danley.  And so one of the managerial guys is taking Mark Zito as an assistant to the Super Bowl?  That's what somebody told me.  I mean, I don't know.  What managerial guy is taking an assistant?  And why would he do that?  That's kind of weird.  Yeah.  Something he needs help?  I don't know.  What does he need help with?  The Super Bowl? 
[01:11:00]  A manservant?  Yeah.  I guess he's higher up in both the sales and the talent, so maybe he needs help wrangling talent.  Maybe that's what that is all about.  But won't there be anybody there who can help him from talent?  Oh.  I mean, I don't know for sure, but I don't know who in the talent department is.  Well, who's bringing an assistant?  One of the, I mean, you could probably, one of the higher ups, I think, in the sort of 
[01:11:30]  talent side of things.  He's scared.  I don't know.  This isn't a secret.  He's scared of name names.  But why?  It's not, it's not.  But that's weird.  If it is what it is, it's not, you're not, there's nothing, it's not like you're uncovering  a crime.  I wouldn't think there's anything wrong with it either, but for some reason.  I think it's really strange.  It's not being addressed.  It's bringing an assistant down.  Such fear.  Oh no, is this like one of those?  Where, is Indianapolis up from here?  I think it is.  I think it's left.  It's left, but a little up?  I don't know.  Maybe?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll do it.  So it comes from me and not Sam. 
[01:12:00]  Okay.  Because Sam's very nervous about this one.  Yeah.  I don't know how this information gets passed around.  What are you doing?  Oh.  He needs an assistant at the Super Bowl.  Mm-hmm.  So that's your Super Bowl update.  Less people in the hallways.  Seems like there's a big party going on down there without us.  And there's going to be a lot of talent, a lot of guests, a lot of, so maybe that's  where the, you know, whole assistant thing comes into play.  I've got to start thinking that we're just assholes. 
[01:12:30]  Well, yeah.  I've got to officially start thinking that.  Well, you could have probably.  Maybe I should have started thinking that five to six years ago.  Even at the beginning when you were just saying.  It's good to acknowledge it.  Horrible things about Gary before you even started this.  He would probably consider you an asshole.  Fuck Gary.  What does he do?  Enough already.  I don't know.  If you can't figure out Super Bowl shit, you're useless.  I pitched an idea, and I pitched it all the way up the ladder, and everyone said no.  What was the idea? 
[01:13:00]  That we get Tom Brady to throw grapes into my asshole.  Now that's, that's good.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine somehow you get that done?  And he has to come and do our show just to do that before he goes to Indianapolis.  Yeah.  No, he does it there.  I mean, it was for there.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It was for there.  Halftime show?  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Got to come out of the locker room just to throw grapes at your asshole?  Yeah.  It was like the day before, you know, like when he's on his way to warm-ups.  And these assholes couldn't get that done.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I was going to call it grape rape.  By the way, I'm not mad, Sam.  You're not?  No, this is just fun for me.  You enjoy it?  Yeah, I'm not even mad anymore.  Right.  I don't really get mad anymore.  Maybe it sounds differently on the air, but I really don't.  It's just more fun to point out the ridiculousness of the situation.  I think you like when things don't go your way because it gives you a chance to point out 
[01:14:00]  things that you see as inabilities in terms of certain...  Well, well, Dr. Sam.  But in the end, I would like things to go our way.  Sure.  I really would.  Sure.  But for some reason, we just could never get that done.  We always work with shitty people.  We really do.  And it knows.  We can list them.  It's just never-ended.  We could list them.  You could.  Never-ending fucking supply.  The only guy I would put on the list of respectability would be Eric Logan. 
[01:14:30]  The only guy.  And slightly Steve Blatter, but we didn't have enough time with him before they gave him  a massive promotion.  So we don't work with the guy.  Right.  Technically.  But the rest of them, they've all just been shitty.  With no fucking skills.  There's a lot of guys that are like, they were hoping their names would be added onto  the list after Eric Logan, and then they just weren't.  No.  Like they were hoping just now you would have more names after.  No.  But you didn't.  And they tried to downplay what Eric did for us.  And I just look at him like, really? 
[01:15:00]  Stop.  Stop already.  He did a lot for us.  Logan, what's the shit?  Wicklin did a good job.  Don Wicklin did a nice job.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Don did.  No, and I mean that.  Yes, he did.  Wiki?  Yeah, but he just did.  Remember Wiki?  Yeah, he's so happy tonight.  Does he have anything to do with this company anymore?  Yeah, he works for BroadMinded and some of the...  What?  ...female channels.  Oh, that makes sense.  Don Wicklin was absolutely a soldier.  Sometimes he couldn't get things done because he didn't have that power.  That's all.  That's what I'm saying.  He's so happy to be not associated with this show anymore. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, he listens still.  Didn't he take some heat from the people for the Rana Fez wedding thing?  Spending like thousands upon thousands of dollars on a radio wedding?  Like over $10,000.  Yeah.  Like it was a real wedding or something.  Look, I'm not saying that XM's spending was out of control and maybe someone needed to  look at the books.  He reined in a...  But now we're completely to the other side now.  Yeah, yeah.  They would just fucking send us places just because they could.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  The poker tournament.  But you know what?  All this stuff.  We got some fucking amazing moments in that poker tournament.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking...  We got out of that perhaps more than that.  Oh, right, yeah.  That fucking callback we've done 10,000 times came from there.  Perhaps more than that.  The Ed Asner thing.  Look, this is...  We had Rogan on the show there.  We've been in this building two and a half years.  Oh, way over two and a half.  We're pushing three.  No, no.  No, it's not that long.  It was April.  April 2009.  Yeah, it'll be three in April. 
[01:16:30]  It'll be three in April.  Yeah, so in three years they have sent us...  Life has just escaped.  Fuck, dude.  In three years they have sent us nowhere.  You haven't been to one place...  Hard Rock?  No, that's not sending us.  Hard Rock.  Do you realize...  Ten fucking times.  Right, we get it.  We can fucking do appearances at the Hard Rock.  This reminds me of a song I wrote.  Time's moving, oh.  XM sent us to Vegas, LA.  LA twice because we did the X Games.  You got to see the DC studio.  That's right, New Orleans. 
[01:17:00]  New Orleans.  Oh, New Orleans a couple of times, right?  DC.  DC.  But we got to watch black people beat up white people in New Orleans.  Remember that stand on a balcony?  Oh, just watching these poor white people file past these gang of black males just punching  the gentleman in the face, groping their girlfriends.  And then when the guy turned around to say, what the fuck are you doing?  They would just cold cock him in the face.  There's blatant racial hate crime going on with, you know, barely any retribution. 
[01:17:30]  We were whipping beads over at them.  Oh, yeah.  Remember?  Remember when we were taking that...  We were so bad with the beads.  Oh, I remember that one.  Do you remember throwing them at the guy in the wheelchair?  I remember doing that.  Wisdom with somebody in the wheelchair.  Well, people would be walking underneath us with their big drinks in their hands, and the  goal was to roll up the beads in a ball and fire it down as hard as you could and hit  the cup directly, and it would knock the drink right out of their hands and splatter all  over their pants and shit. 
[01:18:00]  And then you got to look up real quick like, hey, you're just one of the festive people.  Hilariously fun.  Remember this one?  Oh, yeah.  I can't even remember.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  We didn't do it, though.  Someone else threw it.  No, I know.  She never got over that.  Really?  How do you?  She never did.  How do you know?  Macho Grande?  Because she used to work here.  I ate a chick's pussy in the fucking...  I ate a chick's pussy in the strip club in the afternoon.  She just gave me a lap dance over my face.  I just licked her pussy and jerked off.  I remember that.  That was money well spent by XM. 
[01:18:30]  It sure was.  I remember that.  You know, the Super Bowl is going to be in New Orleans next year.  Really?  That's right.  That's 18 years in a row.  Oh.  Fuck.  You'd think they'd at least be getting ready to send this out to WrestleMania.  Am I right, guys?  We did WrestleMania.  Well, don't say we.  We did.  We.  Some of us weren't there.  Well, you know what?  We were sent to WrestleMania before there was a you, my friend.  Are you kidding me?  Yes.  Believe it or not.  I would go to WrestleMania, even though I've never done it.  It's a good time.  I don't know what would go on there.  It really is a good time.  What I would do.  They set up a radio row and everything. 
[01:19:00]  They got lots of events now.  Oh, well, then I'm not going.  You don't like radio row.  No, I hate radio row.  I want to be protected from it.  Is Scott gone already?  I'm not sure.  What is travel schedule?  It would have to be.  It's Super Bowl week.  You think he's gone already?  No.  What's today?  It's only Wednesday.  It's Super Bowl Sunday.  He'll at least be there tomorrow.  They're starting to like.  A lot of shows.  Every show is going to be there tomorrow.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Larry the Cable Guy is doing his show today, I think.  So he might be down there.  What?  But he doesn't even work for the company.  They hired him.  Blue Collar. 
[01:19:30]  He's not.  Blue Collar.  But he doesn't do any time on Blue Collar.  It's like fucking Eminem over there.  Right.  Same thing.  Yeah.  He's one of those Eminem guys.  They call it Blue Collar and it's based on, you know, the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.  You think we'll ever get to a point where they just hire our names and you just sit back and collect the dough?  Collect the dough.  Like these guys?  Oh, that's got to be great.  You think it'll ever happen?  How great would that be?  No.  No?  Because you've tried to pursue a career in radio.  That's the bad move.  That was stupid, right?  That was dumb.  We should have pursued a career in just getting our name on radio stations. 
[01:20:00]  We have learned to make money in radio, you can't do an actual show.  No.  Correct.  That's the mistake we made.  You shouldn't do a show.  I do lots of shows.  You should just have a name on a window.  You guys have seasonal depression.  Are you feeling down?  Is that the problem?  Well, I would if it wasn't for a happy life.  It's not on.  Oh.  I thought just being in the room, it was like the monolith in 2001, a space odyssey.  Can we compete?  Can we put it over there?  Jesus.  How could pointing in a direction be that funny? 
[01:20:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  Jimmy.  Wow.  Holy fuck, that's funny.  Hey, that's Kevin from Connecticut.  Yes.  Can we turn our lights on to compete with the happy light?  And who brought in the happy light?  This is Troy's happy light from home because he gets seasonal depression.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan gets seasonal depression and he added enough where he thought it out, went and looked 
[01:21:00]  up if there's some cure for it, found it, and bought it.  Maybe he's depressed because he sleeps only like twice a week.  He got the good one.  Like he specifically went on Amazon and found the best happy light there was.  The guy who thinks that 9-11 could have been a cover-up believes that lights could make  you less depressed.  Well, real sunlight does.  But how about you just go outside?  It's seasonal depression.  It is a known fact that these lights do help people. 
[01:21:30]  Do they?  Do they?  Yeah.  They got some studies.  I don't believe it.  They would just say it.  They got people who work for them.  Yeah.  It's a placebo.  You think so?  Yeah.  I think he'd get enough sunlight.  He said, Troy said that he starts to vibrate when he's in front of that for 20 minutes.  So can we get him to do that?  He starts to vibrate?  Does he have something shoved in his ass while this is happening?  There's a butt plug.  There's a butt plug.  Fucking vibrating butt plug attached to the happy light.  Right. 
[01:22:00]  That's the happy part.  There's the light and then the happy.  Because you're supposed to shine it directly on you.  Do you want to just have Troy, the happy light shine on him while you guys do your shit?  We need some happiness today.  I want to feel...  Let Jimmy feel the happiness.  The happy light.  The happy ending light.  Just cum on it.  You ready?  All right.  We're going to turn on the happy light.  It's fucking...  I don't understand what the fuck.  Yay!  Yay!  That Jimmy's happy.  Turn it off.  Yay!  Turn it off.  Bunch of shit. 
[01:22:30]  Utter stupidity.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  This is too good.  That's the happy light.  Hold on.  Hold on.  These fucking people need a say.  You got your thing working right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Give me a minute.  That's a...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Fucking dumb.  It is dumb, right?  It's the happy light by Viralux.  No, it doesn't work.  Viralux.  All right.  What do we got, Jimmy?  We got to make believe now.  There's no make believing.  This is Troy's happy light.  Yeah.  And it's shit.  It's him trying to convince himself that his life doesn't stink when he turns this on. 
[01:23:00]  It doesn't...  Yay!  Yay!  It's just fucking depressing.  It's just fucking depressing.  What?  Eric.  He leaves the music on.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock stinks.  Oh, look at E-Rock waving his arms in there.  It's crazy.  Oh, he doesn't understand.  Be part of the bit.  You turn the music off.  I'm trying to, but people keep fucking talking to me while I'm doing this.  Who was talking to you?  Okay.  Who was talking to you? 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Who was talking to you?  Pass the bug guy.  The Burger King.  What'd they say, E-Rock?  What were they talking to you?  Oh, why don't we play Karma Chameleon?  Well, I'm doing this because you mentioned the monolith.  I'm just like...  Who said Karma Chameleon?  We had the bit going.  Who was doing that?  Don't...  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who, who, who, who?  Give him up.  Give him up.  Who, give him up.  It wasn't Roland.  So it was Paul.  Who was it?  Paul.  Paul.  Oh, what a fucking answer.  No, Uncle.  I didn't say that.  Can we try this again?  Yes.  I said, whenever you're around whales, you're like a chameleon because you blend in. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  All right.  So you got the Troy Kwan happy light in front of you, Jimmy.  I do.  And Troy is, we all, one of our producers, and his, it's fucking hilarious to think that  his life is such shit that he fucking, he puts this, this, oh, it looks like a scale.  It does look like a scale.  It's fucking horrendous.  And it couldn't possibly work. 
[01:24:30]  Utter nonsense.  New age shit.  I'm going to stop this very shortly.  It's exhausting being so happy.  That's got to be.  It works, though, I see.  I do want to just see what it feels like to have it on me.  Just turn it on.  Oh, Jesus.  No, but I was actually seeing it.  I was actually seeing it.  That's why I said actually.  Now, it's just two.  What that is are two fluorescent lights, which are horrible. 
[01:25:00]  Like, that's what you get in an office, and that's what depresses you, is fluorescent lighting.  Yeah, why would you want to be reminded you're still in your cubicle?  No more?  Oh.  You're supposed to do it for 20 minutes.  It's regular fluorescent lights.  Where's Troy Kruble?  I don't know.  Hopefully he's an idiot.  Hopefully he's hanging himself.  Because you stole his happy light.  Yeah.  Troy Kruble.  Oh, God.  Troy.  I make him feel better.  Hi, Troy.  Troy.  He came in, he pointed at him like, huh?  Huh?  The happy light?  Look, that's your baby. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, look at it.  You really like that?  The happy light?  But Troy, it's just two fluorescent lights.  And you can't get anything done because you're getting blinded by the happy light.  Yeah, it's great.  Is that good?  Yeah, it's wonderful.  It's good.  Put this on you, 20 minutes a day.  You really start to vibrate.  I don't know what it is.  Walk us through it.  What's going on with you?  You got seasonal depression?  Yeah, and it keeps getting worse as I get older.  But is it worse because you don't sleep that much and you're out at the clubs doing your DJ thing,  so you don't really get the regular sunlight?  Well, in the summer, I'm always outside. 
[01:26:00]  I love skating.  I love biking, hiking, whatever.  So in the winter, it's just I'd never go outside.  Coming in at the hours that we do, you don't see the sun.  There's days that I leave late, I don't see the sun.  So there's weeks that go by that I don't even know the sun exists.  So I deal with a little bit of, you know, trying to get stoked on life, you know?  So, and before, I went to, I took antidepressants and they fucked me up real bad. 
[01:26:30]  Why don't you try some Uncle Depressants?  I was on, uh...  Chip, Chip, like that one.  No, no, no.  You rubbed his forearm on me.  What antidepressants?  I was on one called Effexor, and I was on another one called, uh...  It affects him too.  See how horrible it is?  He gave Troy the old bump with the forearm.  That's horrible. 
[01:27:00]  I'm laughing.  And how did that shit do to you?  Yeah, how did that shit fuck you up?  Uh, well, it just makes you completely emotionally numb.  Where you just, you don't give a fuck about anything.  What's the whole thing about?  God, that sounds fantastic.  It really does.  Fuck, man.  It does, but then it doesn't.  Because you could be like, oh, your whole family was just murdered.  And you'd just be like, whatever.  And if you're the one that did it, it really doesn't bother you.  Of course.  But wouldn't you want that feeling?  Why would you want to, like, have to go through that emotion?  Well, then I, and then...  Right?  Well...  It's not going to change their plight.  But I feel like it's as strange as it sounds, it affects creativity. 
[01:27:30]  Ah, now you're talking.  So, when you, when you fuck with that, you just, you feel just, you just exist.  So, when are you getting off of it?  See, I was implying there.  So, uh...  But then I try to get off of it by just a cold turkey withdrawal.  You should try heating it up in the microwave.  Oh, shit!  That's a good one!  Uh-oh, who's he going to target? 
[01:28:00]  His...  Oh, he got both of us!  Oh, no!  Oh, chip!  Fucking chip!  Aye, nine!  Aye, nine!  Aye, nine!  Fucking chip.  So, uh, someone suggested these, uh, this light.  Well, yeah, so what happened when you went cold turkey?  Cold turkey.  So, I basically just took all my antidepressants, flushed them down the toilet.  That's smart to do.  Yeah.  That never ends in a shooting.  Yeah, no, it was bad.  Barricading himself in his apartment.  Yeah, we're so lucky.  Come on, get me pigs.  Yeah, really.  We're so lucky, uh, no one got strangled. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, no, it was really bad, because I...  Someone's lucky out there, they have no idea.  I would walk down the street, and I would feel like my heart was stopping in my chest.  Whoa.  And I would literally just start...  Yeah, I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!  So, I would feel like I was...  No!  My head doesn't allow it.  You light that on?  Well, I'm just...  Does that bother your eyes?  A little bit, but I'm just trying for something natural.  Natural?  How is that?  It's a fucking light.  It's too fluorescent light.  It's natural.  It's not putting...  That's the furthest from natural. 
[01:29:00]  It's not putting chemicals...  How about the sun?  Yeah, I would love to.  If you can figure out a way for me to have the sun at this...  Working here on these hours...  Mirrors.  Why don't you just play the Beatles, Here Comes the Sun?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, could you play that?  And then say, Where's the Daughter?  That is a good one.  It's a good song, and I think it just makes you happy listening to the song, meaning you don't  need the regular sunlight.  Yeah, but...  Problem solved.  It's not the same.  I'll take the happy light.  Over Here Comes the Sun.  Ah.  I like this song.  This song's for you.  So who turned you on to that?  Well, I went to my doctor, and they were trying to put me on more prescription. 
[01:29:30]  I was like, no.  So I was like, well, hey, this works for some people.  Give it a shot.  It's called the happy light.  It is, yeah.  The company is called Happy Light.  Yeah.  It's called...  That's an awful big pill to swallow.  So, we were talking about seasonal depression the other day with Joe DeRosa, and there you  go.  Why not just look into that?  See, Sam just pulled up a picture of the sun on a website.  Why not just look at that?  Yeah, it's not the same.  Why?  You got a lot of tattoos.  Why don't you get a tattoo of the sun? 
[01:30:00]  And you can look at the sun right on your forearm.  It's just not the same.  I'm thinking, Beatles, Here Comes the Sun, staring at a picture of the sun on the internet,  you're good.  That works?  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  I'll take my happy light.  Every day, though, you have to sit with the happy light?  I actually haven't done it a lot lately, but it was more so last year.  Can't you just shine it on you while you're sleeping, and then you don't have to worry  about that part of your routine?  I don't know what that would do.  I don't know.  I think your eyes may need to see it.  No.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Dr. Steve can help us.  I think it...  Isn't it something to do with vitamin D, you know? 
[01:30:30]  Don't you get vitamin D from the sun?  Yeah, yeah.  Some kind of vitamin D, some kind of chemichill reaction.  Yeah, that's actually what I started doing this year.  I started taking vitamin D pills.  So I don't think you need to actually look at it.  I think if it's hitting your body...  Yeah, you don't have to look at it.  What do you think?  Happiness goes into your eyeballs?  I don't know.  That's crazy.  You're going to get cataracts.  You're going to get cataracts.  Well, you guys...  I'll bring it in here for you guys.  You guys can keep it in here for a while.  That's good, yeah.  Well, I mean, you know.  That's all right.  Add a little happiness.  Probably good for viewing x-rays with.  You're just hanging up on the wall. 
[01:31:00]  This is...  I've never even heard of that.  I didn't even know they existed at Apulite.  Yeah.  I was happy not knowing they existed.  Yeah.  Knowing they don't exist or something like that.  All right.  Just trying to be quick, and I'm sucking a dick.  That's all right.  Lucky you.  I'm telling you, Jim, keep it on for a little while.  It's light.  It's terrible.  Oh, God, it's horrid.  I get sunlight every day, though.  It's an anger light.  Yeah, you've got to squint, and that's going to cause a header.  Wear sunglasses.  You've got to wear sunglasses in front of it.  All right. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you, Troy, for bringing in the happy light today.  We've got our own happy lights.  Thank you, Sam.  It's about time we turn on our own happy lights.  It's about time they were just on.  Did you unplug this shitty happy light?  These things.  Now we've got a lot of light in this studio.  Oh, that one doesn't work anymore?  Oh, there it is.  This light would depress you in Papillon.  Very good.  Can we make it quick with Dr. Steve today?  Quite frankly, he bores the shit out of a lot of people.  Dr. Steve is beloved.  Well, what happens is the light is like photosynthesis. 
[01:32:00]  It's like a nutrient for your cells.  Sorry.  If it was photosynthesis, you'd have to be plant-based.  I know.  And take pictures.  Dr. Steve, is there anything to this happy light thing?  Oh, my God.  Look, I can't even see you guys anymore.  I'm crazy now with these lights.  Get out of me.  I'm not happy.  I'm annoyed my pupils just slammed shut.  Holy fuck, I can't see shit.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:32:30]  Dr. Steve, what's behind this whole seasonal depression  and the use of light, artificial light, to cure it?  Well, there actually is some science behind that.  And we produce vitamin D when we're out exposed to the sunlight.  And people in the United States have chronically low vitamin D levels  because we're not outside enough. 
[01:33:00]  What does vitamin D do for the human?  What does it do?  What are the benefits?  Well, we used to talk about it just being involved in calcium absorption  and those kinds of things.  But now we're finding that people with low vitamin D levels  are at increased risk for heart disease and cancer and all kinds of crazy shit.  Would a vitamin D supplement help?  Well, it certainly won't hurt.  Now, we don't have any evidence yet that increasing vitamin D levels 
[01:33:30]  will reverse that risk or lessen that risk.  But we do know that people with low levels have high risk.  So it makes sense, at least for now, to try a vitamin D supplement.  I think everybody should take one, especially if you're a city dweller  and not getting enough supplements.  Now, Dr. Steve, don't some of these statistics and things,  aren't they a little wacky?  When you think, if somebody has a vitamin deficiency,  you could probably surmise that they really don't take very good care of themselves. 
[01:34:00]  They're not eating properly.  And perhaps that's why they're getting these diseases  instead of it directly having to do with the vitamins themselves.  If you have a vitamin C deficiency, it's so hard to become vitamin C deficient.  You actually get scurvy in this world.  You're absolutely right.  If someone has scurvy, this is someone who has just basically eaten shit 
[01:34:30]  for the last several years.  Ah, yes.  Dried pork on a ship.  We had a guy that had scurvy.  I've seen one case in my career,  and it was a mountain guy who ate nothing but potatoes three meals a day.  Why?  He must have had potato breath.  Why was he only eating potatoes? 
[01:35:00]  Well, you know, I guess his parents didn't teach him about a balanced diet.  I don't know.  He just lived up.  He would get canned potatoes, and he canned potatoes three meals a day.  And that was bad for you?  He was kind of a hermit, you know.  Yeah.  Wow.  So that's true.  When it comes to vitamin B deficiency, that is a product of our modern lifestyle.  Hey, are vitamin B injections good?  Injections?  You don't need to. 
[01:35:30]  Speaking of vitamin D.  Yeah.  Vitamin double D.  I'll be showing videos of women tits.  Yeah, I was...  Sorry, Dr. Steve.  Nothing against you, but I Like Girls Daily just tweeted a video of knockers.  Big knockers.  She calls them knockers.  So wait, can I get a vitamin D shot?  Yes, you can, Jimmy.  Are they good for you?  I don't know.  There's no reason to.  Your vitamin D is...  Just drink milk.  No, I mean, vitamin B, I'm sorry.  Oh, vitamin B?  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Okay.  It's also very hard to be vitamin B deficient.  It's also very hard to be vitamin B deficient, but you can be B12 deficient if you've got  a lack of a certain chemical in your body that's produced in the stomach.  Charisma?  Yeah.  You better start taking it.  Yeah, well.  Kevin from Con writes, Dr. Steve is on vitamin Z.  Oh, damn.  No, but I want to know about vitamin B12 injections.  Yes. 
[01:36:30]  Just do it.  And see what it does for you.  B12, what happens with B12 is there's a possibility that you can't absorb B12, and the only way  then that you can get it into your body is through injection.  And the nice thing about B12 is it's not toxic, so if you get too much, you just piss it out.  What's it do to you, B12?  How would it make me feel?  Well, B12 is good for making sure that your white blood cells are doing their job.  Of course they're working. 
[01:37:00]  When you have a deficiency in B12, the white blood cells grow really large, and they get  sluggish, and it does other things.  The EROC blood cell.  Can it make you tired?  What most people feel like after they get a B12 shot is a little burst of energy for  a few days.  A few days?  That sounds good.  Well, let's do that.  I want to get...  You want to come up here and inject us in our hineys?  Yeah.  Hell yeah, I would do that.  Yeah?  You can get a B12 shot in your arm, though, but yeah.  Nice.  Can I go to a pharmacy and get that? 
[01:37:30]  You can.  You have to have a prescription, and then you have to have a prescription for the needles,  and then you have to learn how to...  Fuck that.  Let's just inject each other, Jimmy.  Me and you.  Shoot each other up.  I can teach you how to do it.  Oh, that's good, Dr. Steve.  He can teach us how to do it.  You got to hit a vein, though, right?  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, it goes into the muscle.  It's a little skin popping.  No, I don't want to do that.  I want to go to the doctor.  Hey, I don't want to do an apnea machine.  I think I'm dying.  I'm not sleeping.  I think I'm dying. 
[01:38:00]  You're killing everyone around you, Jimmy.  You're not dying, Jimmy.  You're killing everyone.  What, are you going to go to Algeria?  They have those weird things on their heads.  I want to get an apnea machine so I can start living.  Yeah.  Okay, well, do you know that you have sleep apnea?  Oh, God, yes.  I'm just constantly fucking dying.  Can you tape yourself?  I probably should, please.  We could get you a sleep study. 
[01:38:30]  I don't want to go to the place, though,  because if I go to the place, I'll never sleep.  Yeah, that's true.  You only have to sleep for about an hour or two.  I won't even doze off, dude.  Get all the data that they need.  Dude, I can't sleep on a fucking plane  in a comfortable seat with a pillow.  I love when you go and get a sleep study  and they connect you to all these machines and wires  and it's not your bed, and they're like,  yep, you've got a sleep problem.  Of course you do.  Who could sleep in those conditions?  I could. 
[01:39:00]  Really?  I'm a sleeping machine.  I wish I could, dude.  Can they come to my house and do it?  Uh, I'm not aware of any sleep lab  that's doing in-home stuff,  but I'll check on that.  You know what?  You know, in New York City.  That would be a great small business to have  where you go to the person's home,  get a big tit monster to come over  and give you a sleep study.  Oh, yeah.  Because you've got to say,  when you go to a sleep study place,  what do you, bring your own pillows or something?  You can.  You can bring your own pillow if you want to. 
[01:39:30]  And then you lay on your back?  They're very comfortable.  Bring a chick.  Yeah, I can't sleep on my back.  Hang on.  Hey, have a good day, boys.  What?  I'm dropping the kids off at school.  Oh, is that what you call it?  It's called the Cosby kids.  Wait, he has to go?  Oh.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah, no.  All right, Doc Steve, thanks.  I guess he's got to go?  Dr. Steve.  No, no, no, we're good.  All right, thanks for all the info.  We really appreciate it.  Well, you got an emergency?  Would you get a pulse?  No, no, no, no, we're good.  We're good.  Oh, okay.  I thought you said you got to drop the kids off. 
[01:40:00]  The sleep lab is very comfortable and dark and quiet.  Yeah, but you got to wear, like, fucking wires and lay on your back, and I piss 30 times a night.  Yeah, that part's the problem.  They'll give you a little urinal that you can pee in.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  It's kind of cool.  I would love to pee in a jug.  A little jug with a long neck, and you put your monstrous fog in it.  Yeah, I got to fucking, I got to jimmy my cock in there.  By the way, you got to update your info.  I'm being told by a bunch of people you could do a home sleep study now. 
[01:40:30]  I am.  You could do it.  At home?  You can do it.  Yeah, that may be, we don't have that here.  I'm in a rural area, but in a city, that may be a problem.  All right, all right, all right.  Let me get Russ on the line, because he's in complete agreement with Dr. Steve.  Russ?  Hey, guys.  No, actually, I disagree with Dr. Steve.  I say that vitamin D is the hottest vitamin out right now, and I think he's underplaying importance.  Because of it, everybody's in.  I'm not.  I just said everybody should take it. 
[01:41:00]  What's wrong with you?  You didn't even discuss half the things that it does.  It acts like a hormone in your body, and if you're having trouble sleeping, it helps bowel movement.  It helps a lot more than just, it boosts your testosterone.  There's a lot of things for you.  You didn't even mention it.  Because that part's not true, but it is very.  Face to Russ.  Bowel movement.  Damn it.  No, it's a lot of things you didn't even mention.  You know what this is?  WebMD versus Dr. Steve. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  It's going down.  That's right.  If there's one thing Dr. Steve knows about it, it's a good, solid bowel movement.  Yeah.  Now, hey, look, vitamin D does way more than we ever thought that it did, and we're learning more about it all the time.  And, you know, I just touched on the big stuff.  I think everyone should take a vitamin D supplement.  I really do.  I'll take one.  I take a, I should take a multivitamin, but I just don't.  I'm the one, and this is a vitamin break.  It's probably boring for people, but I'm so.  Kind of boring.  Vitamin deficient.  Vitamin breaks. 
[01:42:00]  Vitamin breaks are usually fun.  I know.  Usually we have so much fun with them.  I don't know what happened here.  All right, Russ.  Thanks for the information.  Thank you, Russ.  Dr. Steve.  A bunch of leaves, Russell.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Oh, yeah.  Always a pleasure.  Love Dr. Steve.  When is Dr. Steve's show on?  Night.  No, shit.  Well, Sunday's at 9 a.m., but Saturday's at 9.  I like that promo where he's kind of rapping with the fucking, with the horrible diseases  and afflictions that people have.  Oh, really?  They cut it together really well, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  Troy did that.  Oh, well, he must have been on the happy light at the time.  Yeah, exactly.  His dumb happy light.  I need a break.  Jimmy having trouble sleeping, and Luke, using force on Twitter, writes, hire Steve to talk  to you, Jimmy.  He'll make you pass the fuck out.  Oh, man.  They're bashing our buddy.  I'm just dying in my sleep every night.  Mongo, the trucker, writes, Dr. Steve has humor apnea.  What do you think of these comments there, Dr. Steve? 
[01:43:00]  Eat shit.  Yeah.  Eat shit indeed, sir.  You should say ingest fecal matter.  Vitamin D and some fecal matter.  Chew you up.  Vitamin B12 chaser.  Well, blood cells will swell.  They get sluggish.  They'll be very good.  You got to shrink them down.  They get very sluggish, white blood cells.  Sluggish.  All right.  These happy lights are making me really fucking mad. 
[01:43:30]  Thank you, Steve.  Can we turn them off?  No.  You will really think that I have an issue with humor when you hear double vasectomy  Todd entry into the worst best man contest that I was his best man.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Are we doing that contest?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  I quoted Henny Youngman and Mickey Rooney.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What was the quotes from those two guys? 
[01:44:00]  Why wait?  I'm not falling for that.  Well, what's...  I'm not hanging up on that.  Are you crazy?  I want to hear...  I want to hear the Henny Youngman quote.  He probably said, take my wife, please.  Did you?  Ugh.  It was horrendous.  It was...  But I don't think it was...  It's not bad enough to win, and it's not bad enough to be really funny.  When do we get the...  Do we have the entry?  Yeah.  I sent it in last night.  Oh.  All right.  Well, we're doing that contest soon, I guess. 
[01:44:30]  Everything has to be in by tomorrow.  I don't know anything about this contest.  Have we been talking about this one, Sam?  Yeah, we've been all about it on the after show.  Oh, nice.  I heard that they're doing a big thing.  It's this weekend in Poughkeepsie at Bananas.  There's a big best man thing happening.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, I think you're playing here.  Yes, I am.  Did you just play Poughkeepsie?  No.  I'm confused.  It's been a while.  It's been a while.  I've been doing long shows, too.  Fuck, man.  Good for you.  Hour 15.  Damn it.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  All good stuff.  We just did two hours, Sam, so we should go home.  No, you do a four-hour show.  Who says?  You do.  It's in the contract she signed.  Yo.  Oh.  Right.  We got Snooki and JWoww for the show.  Yes.  Finally.  Coming in.  I guess Snooki got engaged.  Did she really?  She lost a lot of weight and everything.  That's a banger.  Absolutely.  And JWoww, I'd love to.  I got vibes off her last time.  I guess Snooki's going to talk about her engagement today.  That's big news, by the way.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Make sure the Twitterverse knows that one.  Okay, I'll let him know.  Dr. Steve, thank you.  Thank you, my friend.  Bye, buddy.  We're going to hang up like gentlemen today, I've decided.  Gentlemen.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Dr. Steve, everyone.  You know why?  Because I got the happy light on, Sam.  Good.  I told you it worked.  But first this.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Got JWoww and Snooki stopping in today. 
[01:46:00]  First time we've talked to Snooki, I think, right?  Yep.  We've had them all except for her and Ronnie.  Been the one that hasn't come in, right.  Her and Ronnie were the only two.  Yeah.  Then it's down to Ronnie.  Jersey Shore.  I'm in.  I'm watching.  And it's watching.  I've caught some episodes.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  I got to communicate from Dr. Steve.  What?  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Hopefully it's his suicide note. 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  Would you please toss out there that vitamin D is fat soluble.  Can build up and assess them.  So don't take more than the recommended amount.  400 to 1,000 are you.  I guess he felt like our show wasn't boring enough today.  He had to, you know.  He had to like.  Throw that little tag on the little epilogue.  No, no, no.  He says, though, he goes, thanks.  I wouldn't want someone to take my advice to the extreme and hurt themselves.  Well, he's a gentleman.  Yeah.  Well, that was nice of him, I guess.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:47:00]  Thanks on milk.  I hate that.  I hate that.  Oh, man.  You hear the ladies on Bernie Fine and his wife?  Good old Bernie Fine up there in Syracuse.  We forget about Bernie Fine because of the Jerry Sandusky thing.  Yes.  Well, it looks like Bernie Fine had a situation in Syracuse as the assistant coach.  What happened?  For the Syracuse Orangemen, the basketball team.  Yeah.  Well, the story goes, you know, he molested a kid from the time he was what to what? 
[01:47:30]  12 to 38?  Yeah, something like that.  7 to 27.  After three years, he should have stopped.  Three years.  At what age is it your responsibility as far as molestation goes?  Come on.  Let's have a discussion.  Yeah, there really is an age where it just becomes, look, you're not being molested anymore.  You're gay.  It's hard to say because it depends on how old you are. 
[01:48:00]  27, though?  Oh, that's obvious.  Can you be molested by a grown man at 20 years old?  God knows I've tried.  I think if you get through high school, I think that's the cutoff.  Come on.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Come on.  Yeah, high school.  Right?  Yeah.  Because maybe you're like, oh, fuck, he's my history teacher.  Yeah, he got those authority figures. 
[01:48:30]  And he can prevent me from getting into a good college.  Yeah, I just want to be acceptable for a good college.  But anyway, the ladies on Bernie Fine, the wife there, had sex with Syracuse players.  Hey, my wife's fucking the basketball team.  I'm warning you.  Stay away from them.  Hey, stop fucking the basketball team.  They're all black men with giant cocks.  And they're fucking my wife.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Get off my wife, you.  That's why she didn't care. 
[01:49:00]  No, she was getting deep dicked.  If these reports are true.  Yeah.  She was like, whatever, you do what you want.  I'm getting dicked.  She's getting some dicked.  Dicked.  See, but it isn't abuse when she does it.  Yeah.  It's funny.  Yeah, right.  But then again, how old were they?  Were they like 19 or 20 when she was fucking them?  27.  I should have read this ahead of time.  That's why they hook up with two players.  Okay, Davis, who was accusing Fine's husband, 
[01:49:30]  assistant coach Bernie Fine of Molesingham back in the 90s,  said he often drove the two wives to a student housing complex.  That's where they'd hook up with two players.  Identified as players two and three.  I guess Lori Fine and another coach's wife used to speak openly  about relationships with two of the players  and what they like to do in bed, as ball boy is saying.  Ball boy.  During the car ride, the two women spoke explicitly  about their sexual exploits with players two and three.  Wow.  What's player one?  How come it's player two and three? 
[01:50:00]  What did player one do?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  In a particular?  I don't know that word.  How do you spell it?  A-P-E-R-T-I-C-U-L-A-R.  No.  In a particular.  I've never seen that word in my life.  It's probably a mistake.  It's probably a typo.  Are you sure?  In particular.  Origin?  Origin, I don't know.  Definition?  I don't know.  Latin roots?  Use it in a sentence?  All right.  In particular, both women would talk about how good the two players were  at various sexual acts and talk about what specific acts each of the men liked, 
[01:50:30]  including fellatio and other oral acts.  Wow.  Going out on a limb.  A guy that likes his dick sucked.  Yeah, but it's saying, and other oral acts.  That means they were licking the ass.  Ass licking?  Maybe the guy was licking their puss.  I like to think.  Or maybe they were licking their nips and the balls or something.  Oh, my God.  A little ball licking?  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  On an earlier occasion, he went with Laurie to a house where several undergrads were living  and saw her go into the bedroom of an athlete identified as Player One.  There's Player One. 
[01:51:00]  There's Player One.  He said he later saw Player One come out fist-pumping the air and bragging about how he  just had sex with Laurie.  Oh, man.  He said he also suspected her of having a relationship with a fourth player because of the way she  acted with him.  Player Four?  Player Four.  Wow.  He said her pickup moves were always the same.  She would focus on one individual player and start paying enormous attention to that  one player by doing the player's laundry, lending him her car, giving the player money and 
[01:51:30]  gifts, including jewelry.  And generally...  Some jewelry.  Yes.  Basically just getting into the player's life until it became clear that they were in an  intimate relationship.  Her hookups gave her a reputation with the team, the filing says.  Player used to joke openly about it as a known fact that Laurie Fine gave...  And it says good oral sex in parentheses.  Ah, gave good head.  That means blowjobs.  Gave good head.  Gave...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And was great in bed and that anyone could do the coach's wife. 
[01:52:00]  Dave said he told Fine about his wife's Tris, about his wife's Tris, and he did not react  in the slightest.  He was just trying to cover up the...  He was fucking boys.  Man, what a wacky situation.  Man, Syracuse, huh?  Yeah.  You hear about the other teacher doing the cinnamon challenge right after we said don't  do the cinnamon challenge?  Someone got the boot, I guess, huh?  Teacher?  God, there's some shitty teachers out there. 
[01:52:30]  I know there's some good ones, too.  I do know that, but there are a bunch of shitty ones.  What happened?  Like, the teacher just stood there?  This is a known fact that this is really dangerous, and I guess as some form of discipline,  she had a few kids do the cinnamon challenge.  Oh, man.  So they would gag and fucking try to, you know, gasp for air.  And maybe then they would be...  Better students?  Better students?  Ugh, gag me with a spoon.  Ah, I've heard that before.  How does the story go? 
[01:53:00]  That they were eating cinnamon and something was happening.  And this was just so gnarly.  It's just a new name.  It's Valley Jim.  Yeah.  I like Valley Jim.  This is rad.  It's just a new character all the time.  Valley Jim.  Yeah.  Gag me with a spoon.  You don't like Valley Jim?  I hate Valley Jim.  I really hate Valley Jim. 
[01:53:30]  I'm no part of Valley Jim.  You think he stinks?  He stinks.  Valley Jim's embarrassing.  Yeah.  Well, you're embarrassing.  Why don't you gag yourself with a spoon?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about you gag yourself with a wooden spoon?  It's splinters.  It's Valley Jim.  Valley Jim.  So the teacher got suspended?  Or is it principal?  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Damn.  Leads to choking and vomiting.  Of course.  Yeah, we've seen it.  Is it a quick story?  Yeah, it's a principal in New Haven.  And apparently she witnessed it happening in the cafeteria and did nothing.  And just stood by and did nothing.  Correct.  But I heard it was some kind of, some form of discipline.  I'm not getting that from these articles.  Oh.  Is it another one?  Is it another story?  I don't know.  Maybe.  It was like a...  Horseplay?  Was it horseplay?  Was it clowning around? 
[01:54:30]  What were the students doing?  I don't have the story in front of me.  Damn.  I think that's it.  I mean, that's the new one.  Yeah, I mean, it's...  And the principal didn't do anything, so the principal got fucking suspended.  Correct.  But there was another one that used it as punishment.  Punishment?  That's a good punishment.  Okay, this one...  That's the one I saw right there, Sam.  Is that different than the one you just brought up?  What the hell is that?  Who's a fatty?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, no.  This is parents using the cinnamon challenge to punish kids. 
[01:55:00]  That's good.  Look, they all look very inner city.  Dummies, man.  That is a stupid thing to do to your kid.  What?  I can't...  Give him the cinnamon challenge as discipline.  Is there a video?  Can you move this, please?  What, that...  You don't like the happy light anymore?  I hate it.  Jimmy's ready to throw it.  Dumb happy light.  Troy's miserable.  What kind of fucking...  What kind of commercial is that for the happy light when the guy brought it in as miserable?  I know.  I think the happy light is just really not working. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, Jesus.  This character's got to go.  So right when this principal story broke, a video came out of a family in Brooklyn, and  the kids are doing the cinnamon challenge and saying, this is our new torture for our kids  when they don't behave.  Oh.  So that's where the story's going.  That's it.  Let's watch this.  Cinnamon challenge is not small.  Come on, landscape cam, you dummies.  Nine people.  Shit.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:00]  Here.  A little kid.  Kids.  Oh, my God.  How's it taste, Allison?  How's it taste, Allie?  Oh, man.  A little kid is gasping for air.  How old exactly would you say?  How old is that?  How old is that?  How old is that?  Can you fucking believe that?  Pause this.  That kid.  My brother.  She can't.  That kid's what?  Three.  Maybe.  Three and a half.  Maybe. 
[01:56:30]  They'll be three in April.  What the fuck?  There's some shitty people out there, man.  She's giving the kid water, which Eric said just turns it into concrete in your throat.  Why would you do that to your little kid?  Why would you do that to a kid?  The kid could die.  You end up in prison.  You're like, oh, yeah, I just shoved some cinnamon in my kid's face.  We all saw the E-Rock video, and this little kid, you know, was choking.  Yeah.  For gasping.  What the fuck's wrong with people? 
[01:57:00]  They don't think about consequences.  But why would you think that's funny?  It's funny to watch.  Because you don't know the kid.  I don't know the kid.  But, I mean, if you have a kid, you realize how ridiculously stupid that would be to do  to your little fucking innocent kid.  And if the kid dropped dead, they'd be like, I didn't know my child.  Right.  Let's continue this.  He's freaking asking to do it.  So, now we're going to punish him with this much.  Okay.  Yay.  There you go.  Open up. 
[01:57:30]  Ready?  This kid's five.  Go, Antonio, go.  About.  Antonio, try to swallow it.  Okay.  You okay?  You okay?  You okay?  That's good for trust.  Yeah, yeah.  Is the kid crying?  I don't know, because they don't even know how to film a video properly.  Don't you throw up in here.  Don't you throw up in here.  Go.  All right, another kid.  Another tiny kid. 
[01:58:00]  Two kids doing it at once.  At once.  Oh, my.  All right.  Look at where he is.  One kid's doing all right.  Oh, it's hilarious, isn't it?  It's hysterical.  Poop.  Ew.  That kid do it?  Take water.  Look, she's fucking gasping for air.  She's looking around for help.  The kid can't breathe, and they all need help.  He can't get me out of the camera.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  Now they're all doing it at once.  Living in the same world as people like this.  Do it.  No, get it. 
[01:58:30]  Put it in your mouth.  Joseph, is it hot?  What a bunch of idiots.  I don't see her fat ass doing it.  Joseph, spit it out.  Spit it out.  Okay, Joseph.  What do we need?  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  It doesn't get water.  Where do all these kids come from?  It's a really long video, too.  From Park Slope.  Jesus.  What we're looking at is very small children doing the cinnamon challenge. 
[01:59:00]  Being forced to.  Being forced to by parents who think they're fucking hilarious.  What site is this on?  This one's our gothomist.  Good story, Jimmy.  Oh, it is?  It's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, so you can see what we're looking at.  They were being, like, gagged with a spoon.  Quite literally.  I have these spoon vows.  Valley, Jim.  Oh, wow.  Big.  He's been helping.  Way too much.  Let me get a little.  Hold on.  Yeah, let me do it for you.  Okay.  No, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I want to do this on a challenge.  I'm not going to cheat.  I want you to do it.  This is my spoon. 
[01:59:30]  Her side.  Luigi.  Hold on.  You want more?  Luigi.  After I'm done.  Luigi.  The lady's doing it.  Fair enough, she is doing it.  Why would you do this?  It's really.  Our new torture.  How great would it be if she died?  Oh, fantastic.  Kids are doing this all over the place.  This is a really popular thing to do right now.  Okay.  It's old school, though.  I thought so.  Yeah.  But for some reason, everyone's getting into it now.  I'm going to do it.  I'm doing it.  Just do it, you fucking idiot.  All right, who's first?  Angelita. 
[02:00:00]  No, no, just do it one at a time.  Now the adults are going to do it.  No, do it.  Do it all at a time.  Just fucking do it.  We're headed to your video.  Fat ladies that don't want cinnamon.  The nine-year-old girl just did it.  And she's probably going to interfere with her pregnancy.  See?  See what I'm getting at there?  Oh, here you go, Angelina.  Oh, I'm not.  You big girl. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Oh, face is getting red.  Oh, my God.  Where's the water?  Oh, fucking fatso.  Oh, she got it.  She did it.  She got it, girl.  Wait.  Three.  One.  I like that one in the middle.  She's cute.  Don't aim at each other.  You might spin it.  Oh, you blew it all over the place.  They're doing it.  Two women just did it together.  Oh, God.  Buffy out.  Oh, my God.  She's disintegrating from the inside. 
[02:01:00]  I get it.  Cinnamon.  And the kids are all pointing and laughing.  Oh, my God.  I guess it beats pummeling the kids.  Throwing them out the window.  Possums.  They're making it look much more fun than we did.  Yeah, yeah.  They are making it look fun.  No, the problem is the tiny little kids doing it.  Whatever.  That's right.  They're probably poorly behaved.  This will straighten them out.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Punishment.  That video is getting some play out there. 
[02:01:30]  Punishments aren't supposed to be pleasant.  No, this is...  Wait, go back to the beginning of this.  And then, of course, E-Rock.  This is...  One, two, three.  See, it could go horribly wrong like it did that day with E-Rock.  E-Rock is the...  Oh, my God.  I can't look at this.  Oh, valley shimmy.  It's so grody. 
[02:02:00]  Grody.  Grody.  There's some 80s reference.  We got silly to me.  The happy light made him silly.  That happy light's got to go.  Yeah, it doesn't make anybody happy.  It just made me sad.  I don't even know how to react to valley, Jimmy.  I don't know what to do.  Gag yourself with a spoon. 
[02:02:30]  I don't think I will.  Valley gym's probably a hit with the listeners.  Oh, no.  They want you buried.  They're not liking valley jimmy.  No, they're not.  Someone gagged Jimmy with a cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Drink your soup.  That's what I'm doing.  It's super-rific. 
[02:03:00]  We got Spaz's giant mosquito.  Ah.  That's what we're waiting for.  We explained this like two hours ago.  Basically, Spaz worked for the show 10, 12 years ago.  Yeah.  10 years ago.  I don't know.  And he was a great character, but he really wasn't playing a character.  He was just playing himself.  It was him.  Gave us great radio.  He looked at the world very differently.  Kind of like Carl from-  Like a retard.  Kind of like Carl from An Idiot Abroad. 
[02:03:30]  Yep.  And one day he came to us and said he didn't want to be Spaz anymore.  He just wanted to be Kevin.  Not realizing that it's one and the same.  Right.  We didn't really understand the two because when he wasn't on the air, he was the same  kind of guy.  Yeah.  And we said, basically, that's not really going to work.  That means you're just going to be an intern.  We can't pay you to be Kevin.  Right.  And he handed in his resignation and we never saw him again.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's been about 10 years.  So we found the giant mosquito clip.  Giant mosquito.  This is more for the newer listeners, I would assume. 
[02:04:00]  Well, I think if you heard, because we haven't played this in a long time, you've heard it  in the past.  It's going to be fun to hear again.  All right.  I'm looking forward to hearing it.  Here's Spaz.  I'll look back.  The giant mosquito.  All right.  Let's move on with the giant mosquito, I believe, is next.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing  people.  Whoa.  There he is.  It's all a giant mosquito seen crossing the Triborough Bridge. 
[02:04:30]  Whoa.  Giant mosquito.  You're convinced that's one mosquito and they're trying to find this one mosquito.  No, what I meant was there's a bunch of mosquitoes under one breed.  So it's a giant mosquito breed.  What?  Next thing you know, he's going to say there's a bunch of chinks running away.  Could you name all the different mosquito breeds?  Yeah.  I know.  I can look at pictures of them.  Yeah.  Pictures are good. 
[02:05:00]  I like our pictures.  Whoa.  He has the centerfold pullout.  All right.  Listen.  Field and stream.  All right.  Listen.  This gets really good.  I'm going to have to.  Let's let the tape ride.  All right.  Here we go.  Holy crap.  The giant mosquito in Queens killing people.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing people.  Apparently, it affects your immune system and your brain.  It inflates.  It's called.  I can't even pronounce this.  Here it goes. 
[02:05:30]  Encephalita.  Anyway.  Encephalita.  Look at how hard it's at.  Encephalita.  I don't do it.  Encephalita.  It's Homer Simpson, everyone.  Did you figure out how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it.  Try again.  I need the word in front of me to pronounce it.  All right.  Someone give him the word. 
[02:06:00]  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  I can't even pronounce this.  Encephalita.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  All right.  I got it.  You got the word in front of you.  All right.  Go ahead.  Spaz has the word in front of him.  Third death feared from Encephalita.  That's my sister's name.  Encephalita.  You get your ass over here.  Your sister's spatula and levore is inside.  Encephalita.  Bill, what's up? 
[02:06:30]  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You know, I was driving home down the southern state.  You know, I saw the big mosquito behind me chasing me.  I got really scared.  I sped up.  But he came up alongside me and he just wowed me.  I couldn't believe it.  He had a big KKK dog t-shirt on.  I just crashed.  I couldn't believe it.  I was shocked.  Very good.  That will shock you.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  Encephalita. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  Let's get back into the giant mosquito story.  And it inflames the outer layer of your brain.  Is that what happened?  The mosquito is carrying.  In severe cases, these are some of the symptoms you may get.  Severe headaches, muscle aches, high fever, stiff neck, disorientation.  Then you go into a coma, have a couple of tremors, a convulsion or two.  Then you're in paralysis and then could die.  Coincidentally enough, the same thing that happens when I'm listening to K-Dog. 
[02:07:30]  You sure you didn't get bit by this mosquito?  I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  All right.  Let's get back to the tape.  These are the symptoms that people infected have been showing.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Residents are being sprayed.  The residents are being sprayed.  What?  Dude, no, they're spraying like sumps and stagnant pools of water and brush. 
[02:08:00]  Not the people.  Damn you.  It's a mad house.  So you think they're just running around with this spray and spraying people as they're going about their business?  Super soakers full of DDT.  No.  There were tables set up with officers in that outbreak suit.  And they had to cut her in and off.  They were just spraying people as they walked by the table.  That's the picture I saw. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my God.  If I just, like, cracked his head open right now, would I be charged with anything?  Or would it be a public service?  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Now, actually, there are ways to prevent yourself from getting hit with this mosquito in Queens.  Hit with this mosquito?  Dare he try to say?  What's the word?  Encephalitis.  It's like you're from another country. 
[02:09:00]  You know?  I'm going to pee myself.  I swear to God.  Encephalitis, where's Bactine?  Where's your sister Bactine?  It's still a giant mosquito at this point, Ant.  Yes.  One large giant mosquito.  Thank God they're spraying the residents of Queens.  Just walking around with bug spray.  Spraying the residents.  In Queens, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks when outdoors. 
[02:09:30]  Use insect repellent that includes DEET, D-E-E-T.  Avoid outdoor activity from dusk till dawn.  Remove water from cars and jars, because that's where miscues later eggs and, you know, settled water.  And check your home for tight-fitting screens indoors.  Much like the rules of coming out during the summer, you know, don't wear heavy clothing, don't run at 100 degree heat.  This is common sense, people.  Follow it. 
[02:10:00]  Wait a minute.  You're telling people to follow common sense?  I am stupefied, man.  What?  It's common sense, people.  Follow it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's move on here.  I would be able to control the boner if this was more, like, expected to happen, but I didn't expect you'd be here in studio. 
[02:10:30]  What an adorable little boner.  This is a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for.  Oh, I love surprises.  This is a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Oh, you're Christmas all over my shorts.  I'm just trying to look at her.  At the same time, I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, Bobo.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, it's so cute.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, pretend I'm your brother. 
[02:11:00]  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Your tweets excite me.  I'm trying to control the boner, the boner, the boner.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm going to go over it already.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Hey, this is Billy Conley. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hey, this is Quentin Tarantino.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss.  Hey, this is John C. Reilly.  Hey, this is Kevin Smith.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Two dudes I could sit around and talk to for hours  and have sat around and talked to for hours.  Thank you, Kevin. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you very much.  Kevin Smith's going to be on the show, I think, maybe next week?  Yes.  Soon.  It's been too long.  Also next week, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  What?  Lou Alcindor?  And there's somebody else next week.  Uh, Daryl Hammond.  Make his first appearance on the show.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah.  I was walking to the bathroom and some guy said that, um... 
[02:12:30]  Do you want to suck your dick?  Yeah.  Besides that.  All right.  Besides that, we got past that part of it.  Kind of skated past that awkward part of the conversation.  You know, we were talking about Rachel Maddow, who disappointed us, certainly, today.  She always disappoints.  Um, she's going to be doing Howard's show next week.  I'm just telling this because someone told me.  I just asked someone, is Rachel Maddow coming in anytime soon?  Yeah.  I was curious about that.  And I guess Howard's had a crush on her for a year, and all he wants to do is fuck her, 
[02:13:00]  and now she's going to be doing his show.  And I'm thinking, what's wrong with Howard?  There's nothing attractive about...  Do you find anything sexy or attractive about Rachel Maddow?  She's anti-sexy.  Supposedly, he's been obsessing about her for a year.  This is everything I just heard, just going to the bathroom.  I didn't ask any questions.  This was told to me.  Well, good luck there.  She wears boys' clothes when she's not on TV. 
[02:13:30]  Like, what is attractive about her?  There's nothing body-wise.  That you would fantasize about fucking her for a year.  She's got a very masculine look to her.  Jimmy, I know you're not, like, a big fan of hers, but would you find her sexually attractive?  Rachel Maddow?  Not in that photo, but in a couple of them, she looks pretty.  She can look good.  Wow, I'm missing...  There are some horrible photos of her.  I'm missing something here, then.  Let's see.  Oh, she's just one of the guys.  She's just one of the guys.  Knocking around, one of the guys.  Yeah.  Why would you have a fantasy about someone that's just one of the guys?  I don't...  She tries to boy herself up because she's trying to go the other way. 
[02:14:00]  In real life, she wants to be a boy.  Right.  But MSNBC said, wow, you're talented for what we're doing, but we need you to look a little  softer on TV.  She doesn't want to look like that on TV.  She wants to wear boys' clothes all the fucking time.  She wears hoodies when she's not on TV.  Like guys do.  Just hoodies and, like, some fucking, you know, like, Pauly D-type sneakers.  Yeah, she has a big man neck.  She is kind of awful.  She is just too masculine. 
[02:14:30]  But why would you be sexually attracted to her to the point you want to fuck her?  I don't think that's crazy to want to fuck her.  I mean, she's just an odd, odd-looking...  Maybe there's something better.  Oh, really?  Look at that picture.  It's in the same vein as wanting to fuck a midget.  You know?  Her personality might, uh...  Sometimes people want to fuck people.  What, that bleeding heart left-wing babble that would come out of her yaw?  No, there might be something in her that makes it look like she'd be a dirty fuck.  You walked in the middle of this.  I went to the bathroom and someone offered up.  All I did was I asked, is Rachel Maddow coming in? 
[02:15:00]  I was curious because maybe we'll try to get her on and see what she's all about.  And then this guy was telling me that Howard's been obsessing about her for a year,  wants to fuck her, and she's coming in next week.  And I was just confused by that.  Like, that?  You would obsess about that for a year?  Well, if she thinks she's going to get viewers out of it, he is fucking her.  But don't forget...  This ain't going to happen.  Don't forget, though, she doesn't look like that on TV.  She looks different on TV.  She looks a little better on TV.  Now they make her up, and then she looks like an older broad. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, remember when we told everyone that eventually we would see the bin Laden photos?  Yeah.  Bin Laden death photos may be released after all.  U.S. renews warning of backlash.  What?  The world may yet see the photos and even the video of a dead Osama bin Laden.  That'd be cool.  There's a conservative group called the Judicial Watch. 
[02:16:00]  They have sued for release of the materials under the freedom of information law.  What do the Jews have to do with it?  And they apparently have a case.  Yes, they do.  Former Justice Department privacy official Dan Metcalfe told the website that a government brief  in the case effectively concedes portions of the records that are legally required to be disclosed.  Ah, I don't know what that means, but cool.  Let's see the pictures.  Sounded good.  Yeah.  I don't want to see that.  That's going to be so gross.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  Valley Jim.  Valley Jim.  He's a Valley Jim.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  I had so much fun yesterday.  I went to the range for the first time in a while.  Yeah.  And I bought a brand new gun.  Why?  I got, because I like guns.  But you have a lot of them.  Yeah, but this was a great one.  Why was this one important?  Well, this is a Benelli.  A Benelli.  But now my mother makes a Benelli.  She fucking puts the sauce on it to die for.  She, ah, it's a big fucking banana. 
[02:17:00]  You're going to eat that?  No.  Oh.  Jimmy?  Shove it up your head.  That is a big, and it's straight too.  It's not very curvy.  I don't want my bananas to look like dongers.  That is a big donger.  This is, who eats this?  I don't know.  How big is that?  That's a good eight inch.  No, it's bigger than eight.  Is it?  Yes, dude.  That's fucking.  I know eight.  That's 10 by.  Is it?  Yeah.  Okay.  10 by four.  You must be fucking hung.  Nah. 
[02:17:30]  What is that, six?  I don't know.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  This is probably a portion of 12.  Is it?  A portion of 12.  Nice.  That's a fat one.  Yeah.  Benelli.  Well, yeah.  A bunch of Benelli's moved in next door.  The damn property value went down.  Fucking Benelli's.  Hey, Benelli lover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a Benelli shotgun.  It's a 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun.  So, as fast as you pull the trigger, you know, shotgun shells fly out of the fucking thing.  Slugs. 
[02:18:00]  And I took it down to the range yesterday.  And I have these targets that are of, you know, Middle Eastern gentlemen with AK-47s and the little headgear on.  And then the American criminal guy that just looks like Bob Kelly.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's like, dude, don't shoot me, dude.  It just looks like Bobby.  And it was kind of fun to shoot.  But I got that one and then also brought a couple of pistols down there.  And the chunks of target that the 12 gauge take out, it's just so much fun. 
[02:18:30]  Just shoot.  It turns into confetti.  Shooting's fun.  Do they put up doors for the shotguns?  What do you mean?  12 gauges.  I'd like to see what a 12 gauge does to a door.  Oh, they use them to breach doors.  Yeah.  No, I mean when you're shooting, though.  I think that would be kind of cool.  Oh, that would be cool.  Yeah, no, they'd pretty much just fly the paper out there and let you shoot at that.  Why can't they make it more interesting?  Well, at Calverton out on Long Island, they used to do that.  They used to be able to bring all kinds of things, propane tanks out there and just blow them up. 
[02:19:00]  What was the problem?  I guess somebody fucked it up for everybody.  In what way?  Someone probably got killed.  Oh, really?  I have no idea.  Because, you know, as a sort of golfer, you go to the driving range and it gets boring after a while.  And every once in a while, you get a driving range where they put cool shit out there.  Yeah, they'll let you get stuff.  To make it a little more interesting.  Right.  A little cars and shit with the windows still in it.  Yeah, you want to be able to aim for something, have a little fun with it.  Right.  Yeah.  I wonder what the real reasoning is there.  I don't know.  They had to make it like this is a serious thing. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  You can't goof around too much on this.  Yeah, that's pretty much what guns are about.  And if it's a sport, then you do want to do kind of silly things.  Have a little more fun with it.  Right.  That's what I was saying.  And then also at the range yesterday, there was a, I'm waiting for Keith to show up and  these high school students walk in.  Yeah.  With gun cases and stuff and some really attractive girls.  But with guns.  And I'm like, they're from, I guess, Garden City High School.  They have a club?  Has a gun shooting. 
[02:20:00]  I'm like, they still have this shit?  That's awesome.  Like, I love it.  But I thought, you know, after the whole Columbine and this PC and anti-gun movement.  Sure.  I never thought high schools actually still have programs that allow kids to go to ranges and  shoot guns.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  Yeah, it was pretty interesting to see.  And, you know, there's nothing wrong with a high school girl or two walking around with  a gun.  That's kind of hot.  If you ask me.  Someone's saying they go to junkyards and shoot out the old cars. 
[02:20:30]  Could you do that?  Oh, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Discharging a firearm within city limits, not in an area that's legal.  Long Island.  Yeah.  We live in a bad area for that shit.  But, you know, there's a lot of open land out there.  When you go to upstate New York, you could go out in the woods and blast away.  Find an old junkyard.  Or no one's going to even hear your fucking gun go away.  Yeah, you could just blast away there.  But Long Island is really bad.  New York City, forget about it.  Yeah.  But it's still fun to go out there, though, and blast off some rounds. 
[02:21:00]  It was fun.  Snooki and JWoww coming by.  Finally, the Snooki.  You saw Snooki, right?  At a football game?  Yeah, I met her at a Jets game.  She was actually the football, which is, right?  She hated it.  That was a joke.  I went, I went, which is, which is, why did I say that, Jimmy?  What is that in comedy?  You said, which is.  You know, she's actually the football, which is, I mean, I had nothing else to say.  I'll tell you what it is.  It's talking after the punchline is. 
[02:21:30]  Good.  That's a good thing to do.  Yes, it is.  Because it will cover up the silence.  It's a weird.  Yes.  But it's a bad trait to be in.  And it's also, you try to structure jokes, but some guys might say that that's the way  to do it.  Like, like Rickles does that.  But anyway, but anyway, but you know, like that, you know.  Another thing.  But yeah, so a lot of guys do that.  It's a timing thing.  Yeah.  But I don't like to do that.  I like to, literally when a joke is done, I like to feel like I'm standing on a ledge with  my arms up and my cock sticking out. 
[02:22:00]  I'll have to try that next time.  You normally do.  Yeah.  You normally talk into jokes.  No.  You normally just fucking pound out a punchline.  But I got to try with my dick hanging out.  Yeah, man.  I'd love to see that.  I'd love to use my, yeah, I almost said something stupid.  Oh, see.  I met her at a Jets game.  Yeah, at a Jets game.  And she's a short little thing, right?  She can't be more than 4'7", 4'8".  Wow.  Yeah.  Really short.  That's a midget.  Breaking news.  Uh-oh. 
[02:22:30]  We lost an entertainer.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Suicide.  Who?  I'm not saying.  What?  I'll just look down.  Someone will have it.  Let's see.  Who was listening to the show today?  Suicide.  Suicide.  Oh, it's a couple days old.  Who?  Who is it?  The soap guy.  The soap guy.  Soap opera dude?  Soul Train.  I don't think so.  Soul Train?  No way.  Don Cornelius?  Don Cornelius?  Yeah.  Just killed himself.  What happened?  It's on the front page of TMZ. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Don Cornelius.  They found his body around 4 a.m. this morning with a gunshot wound to the head.  Oh, man.  Why was he depressed?  His career had gone nowhere?  We should have had the happy life.  What the fuck are we doing with it?  How old was he?  Yeah.  How old was he?  75.  Oh, he had health issues.  That's not suicide.  Maybe he had some mental or physical problems.  Well, they're saying apparent suicide, no other information.  That's not suicide.  Stories developing. 
[02:23:30]  You make it to 75 that you're just controlling your out.  Yeah.  Don Cornelius.  75 is about where you're supposed to...  That's about the age you're supposed to live to, so...  Man.  He probably realized his health was going the other way and said, fuck that.  I'm going to do this now.  Soul Train used to scare me when I was a kid.  Of course it did.  It was...  Well, yeah.  I think that was it.  I liked the beginning because it was a cartoon of the train.  All right.  It was like...  Soul Train! 
[02:24:00]  Right.  And then all of a sudden I went like...  Yeah, and there were black people with giant afros doing like fucking crazy dances.  That grinded.  And it scared me.  The white girls we knew didn't grind like that.  Oh, no.  It was frightening.  Soul Train.  Ah.  And every commercial was for black people hair products.  That's even the newer one that I remember.  Really?  I'm talking way back.  I don't know if I ever watched Soul Train.  Soul Train. 
[02:24:30]  What year is it on?  1990 to 1996.  Oh, see, I thought it was before.  This is definitely from the...  Says it debuted in 71 and ran to 2006.  2006.  And that was it.  So why did he kill himself in 2006?  Was he the host the whole time?  I don't think so.  Could have been a host in 2006 as an old man.  Soul Train.  All right.  Oh, man.  And Don Cornelius, he was the Mac Daddy back then in the day as far as black dance went. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, because there was American Bandstand.  And that was the white...  That was very white.  A lot of white people.  And then they had like the black couple that would be up there just so they could put the  camera on them.  But for the most part, it was just white people dancing poorly.  And then Soul Train was like, oh, really?  Let's show you how it's done, whitey.  Let's end this shit up.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's show you how this shit's done, motherfuckers.  Sam, Soul Train or American Bandstand? 
[02:25:30]  Soul Train.  You're black.  Sam's got to say Soul Train.  What's it funner?  Huh?  It's a funner show.  Why?  It's funner?  Well, I mean, I wouldn't watch any of them.  Because they're grinding their booties into your penis?  Yeah.  I was an actual child of the 80s.  So I wouldn't have watched either American Bandstand or Soul Train.  How about Dance Fever?  Dance Fever.  Did it, did it, did it, did it, dance.  You're a fellow child of the 80s?  That's great.  I watched The Grind.  Let's hug it out.  The Grind?  With Eric Neese.  Eric Neese from Real World One. 
[02:26:00]  How about Eric Nephew?  The original situation, by the way.  Right.  Yeah.  Yes, that is true.  Hey, Ant, a fellow child of the 80s right here.  I know.  It's not a fellow.  We should talk about the 80s and what it was like growing up in the 80s.  Yeah, there's actually multiple generations between us.  What?  What are you talking about?  I am officially a child of the 80s.  Sorry.  Sorry you can't accept that.  Me too.  At least two generations between us.  I am a child of the 80s, Sam.  But you could be my dad, though.  Oh, man. 
[02:26:30]  Can I?  He doesn't have a handle by my mustache.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, but he did.  Guess who he fucked?  Did your mom ever visit Geneseo?  No, my mom didn't visit Geneseo.  She probably did.  It was probably a fraternity thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She was known as the Cracker Lady.  Yeah, but I wouldn't have watched either.  I watched The Grind.  All right, so we're both children of the 80s.  That's good.  No.  We've got something in common.  First day of Black History Month and Don Cornelius offs himself.  Wow.  What the fuck is that going to do for the rest of the month? 
[02:27:00]  It's going to put a real damper on it.  Is that how the new Black History Month is going to?  One every day?  One person is going to commit suicide?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I think so.  Yeah.  So can we play some Soul Train shit?  Soul Train.  Sponsored by...  And then it was like Black Hair Care Products.  Yeah.  Gary just gave me a big announcement.  Jet Magazine.  Gary just gave me a big announcement.  Did he?  Okay.  Yes, he did.  Oh, what is it? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no.  What's your...  Oh, no.  He really is hoping that we would announce this today.  Oh.  That sound you're hearing is the announcement paper that was given to Opie.  It's a really big announcement.  To announce.  Oh, boy.  That's just such an asshole move.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, look how shredded it is.  It looks like it went through... 
[02:28:00]  More?  That shit's shredded.  I don't know if we can do one more.  That's a tough one.  How come they don't just take the bags out of paper shredders and just put the stuff  back together?  Well, there's a cross-cut shredder.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen what it looks like in the bag?  The real shredders are cross-cut shredders.  They not only shred them in strips, but as it's gone through it, cross-cuts them and  it makes pretty much confetti out of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It breaks down the actual paper, it seems like.  And then you burn it.  Oh, really?  You could.  So that's the big one.  You got a shredder, Jim?  I do. 
[02:28:30]  Isn't it fun to shred?  Yeah.  I like shredding.  Do you really?  Yeah, it's fun.  I'm the asshole that puts too much in every time.  Jams it up.  I've gone through three shredders.  Why can't I just take my time with it?  My game is to keep the shredder running.  It's like, because you know if you put a piece through and then nothing else follows,  it'll automatically shut off until the next piece goes in.  Sure.  The game is you got to keep it running.  And sometimes it's like, I got to get an envelope.  I got to put it sideways.  And that gives me more time to get another piece of paper.  You shove it in.  Oh, it's a game.  Sounds fun. 
[02:29:00]  You got a rhythm going.  It's a pisser.  So that's exciting.  That announcement's very exciting.  You didn't make the announcement.  Oh, what was the announcement?  Good for SiriusXM.  That's terrific.  Glad they got that done.  Should we take a break?  And then Snooki and JWoww will be here.  All right.  We either break now or we go to the end of the show.  What do you want to do?  What time are they to be here?  Let's break now.  Seven minutes.  Let's take a single.  I got to piss.  All right.  Yeah, I can piss too.  Let's all go piss.  Yeah.  How much fun is this?  Let's do a little man-to-man comparing. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Awesome.  Yeah, I'll show today.  You going to show off?  You going to show it off?  I think so.  Can I come?  Ew.  Can you come?  No, with you guys.  Oh.  There's a difference between showing and then coming.  Oh.  I just want to take a look.  Let's pee in each other's urinals.  All right, wait.  They're on their way up.  Like, we'll stand in front of a certain urinal, and then we'll pee.  Well, they're on their way up right now.  JWoww is Snooki next.  All right.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:30:00]  I want to welcome JWoww and Snooki to the show.  What?  Oh, and Dr. Gay comes in.  What happened?  It's Jay, Bluch, and Dummy.  What happened?  I thought they were right around the corner.  They are.  They're just putting their stuff down in the green room.  They'll be here in a minute.  What?  Oh, no rush.  Use the facilities, and then...  Are they?  Do they have to go... 
[02:30:30]  Did you see them?  I'm not saying that.  No, I have not seen them.  Who's seen them?  I've got a tampon.  Something.  I've seen them on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You didn't see them?  This will be good.  No.  So what are we expecting here?  There's a dozen people with them.  Oh, really?  They've got a posse?  Yeah.  No posse in here.  What are we expecting?  I don't know.  JWoww was cool last time she was on.  Yeah, I liked her a lot, actually.  We definitely liked her, and Snooki.  We're meeting her for the first time. 
[02:31:00]  She's blown off our show many times in the past, but...  Yeah.  She's finally doing it, and they're doing a spin-off show.  Which they refused a permit in Hoboken.  Why would Hoboken say no?  They just didn't want...  Security reasons?  I don't know.  They said they don't want people, these huge crowds, and the inconvenience.  I got a little confused.  I think they have a permit rule where you can't film in a residential area after 11 p.m.  Oh, right.  And they were looking for a 24-hour permit. 
[02:31:30]  Which one?  Yeah.  Give me a...  That's the official reason.  Hope's taking a Cialis.  What's the plump up?  Notice me and Jimmy being like little fucking ladies.  At the urinals, we were talking about our flu shots.  Oh, it's terrible.  They're just talking about these medical things.  Like, oh, sometimes I get a scratchy throat.  Oh, I thought I had a cold.  I feel like I'm coming down with something, and I'm pissed off at myself because I walk  by the CVS every day, and I go, get a flu shot. 
[02:32:00]  You didn't get a flu shot.  This had been working great the last couple of winters for me, but I kept blowing it off  like, ah, I'll do it tomorrow or next week.  And now I feel like something's coming on, and I'm just praying it's not the big flu.  Yeah, you're hoping it's just a little...  I'm hoping maybe it's the change of weather.  Because New York, it's going to be, what, 65 today?  Jimmy was being a little more wash woman-y.  Oh, good.  I added in that I never get flu shots, but I did this year, and I was very happy with  myself for having done so, because now I got a bit of a cold, but nothing... 
[02:32:30]  I don't care, I don't care.  Believe me, this is just where it gets fascinating.  I don't go over, I don't care.  I'm glad I got a flu shot, and I would probably do it again, having seen the effect that it  had on me.  I don't care, I don't care.  He doesn't care.  But then again, I've been washing the equipment before I work out, too.  That helps a lot, too, when you wipe down the equipment.  Oh, yeah.  Wipe it down with AIDS.  Couldn't be any worse than my behavior over the years. 
[02:33:00]  Jesus.  That's why I don't go to a gym.  When you're out with a girl, you're not supposed to walk by condoms and go, what are these?  Oh, no, that's Mars.  Oh, shit, I thought you were Snokey.  No.  They're in the green room, but they need a couple minutes.  Why?  They just need a couple minutes.  Maintenance.  Tell me what's going on.  Mars, what's going on?  I do not know.  What's going on?  Sam?  Sam.  What do you think is going on?  They're just, they're prepping, I think.  Primping is more like it, right?  Why are you smiling?  What's going on?  Is there a situation? 
[02:33:30]  The situation's not here.  Oh, see, that's funny.  Why are you smiling?  What's going on?  Because I think it's funny that they're here, but instead of just walking up the hall, they're  just sitting in the green room.  Is this like one of their bits or something?  I don't know.  What are they doing?  Sitting in the green room.  Ah.  Travis, what's going on?  They're in the bathroom.  So what's this stuff?  This is what Snooki's promoting.  Oh, boy.  What is it?  Let me smell it.  Oh, no.  Perfume.  This is a perfume.  But Sammy's sweetheart stuff wasn't bad, so I, you know, let me smell it. 
[02:34:00]  And this is bronzer.  That's funny.  Oh, man.  I hope her and J-Wide don't get into a war about who's better.  Bronzer's better.  How do you know they both have bronzers out there?  Because he's a...  Can we open this?  I was going to say they promoted it on our show.  Could we bronze ourselves?  Would you like me to open it for you?  Let's wait and see if she approves of it.  Could you rub that shit on us, Travis?  Well, I mean...  What's going on?  Oh, it's already up.  It's only been seven years.  I never thought you'd ask.  Ultra dark hot bronzer.  Mmm.  Black bronzer.  Black bronzer.  I'm going to rub that on my dick. 
[02:34:30]  You're trying to be deceitful.  Ah, shit.  If it looks black, it must be adequate.  Oh, God.  Roland told me they're in the bathroom.  Now they're in the bathroom?  They're probably dropping deuces.  Oh, man.  You think they're dumping?  A nice fucking hangover shit.  Yeah.  Funny.  Snooki's just squatting over the bowl, hovering.  Sounds like Niagara Falls.  With grunts.  With grunts and a few coughs. 
[02:35:00]  God, that's horrible.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be nice as pie when they come in.  We sure will be.  We were talking about her hangover shit.  I really want to smell this stuff, but it came...  It was sent to us.  It's 60 pounds.  Oh, okay.  It's probably in a decorative decanter.  A Snooki...  What is that?  I don't think she's going to take it with her.  Is that her perfume?  Yes.  Oh.  What does it smell like?  I don't know.  I'm trying to open the package.  Let's spray it around the room and see if she notices when she comes in. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Before she walked in, she had an allergic reaction.  She sneezed.  What is that?  It smells like bug spray.  It's not in the comments.  Well, what...  Oh.  What's up?  They're not in the bathroom.  They're sitting in the green room.  Why?  Are they listening to us?  What green room?  The one in the lobby.  The lobby.  The real one.  Roland's literally standing outside the green room, just kind of...  What time are they supposed to be on?  Oh, my God.  Now?  Yeah.  A minute ago.  9.35.  Oh, okay.  This is hilarious. 
[02:36:00]  This is hilarious.  What are they waiting for?  What are you waiting for, sir?  Could you open up the curtain so we can see if they're making their way?  And then you can close the curtain.  Sure.  This?  I know why, by the way.  Do you?  Why?  Yeah, I do.  Why?  I do know.  I do know.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Because Snooki's pregnant.  Whoa.  The announcement's been made.  Snooki's pregnant, and she doesn't want us to confront her with that.  Yeah.  I don't think that's it. 
[02:36:30]  They're not here yet.  Yeah?  Pinky bet?  They're not even here yet, right?  What does it smell like?  It smells very girly.  It's not bad.  Let me see.  Snooki's pregnant.  Let me see.  Spray a little piece of paper.  Snooki!  Oh, Mars.  Shit.  I'll spray myself with it.  Don't be fine.  I already got cologne on, though.  I'm already wearing Tom Ford.  It smells very sweet, and...  It's girly.  Is it fruity?  You know what it smells like?  A stripper.  This is stripper smell.  Ooh.  Mmm. 
[02:37:00]  Ooh.  I like the smell.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Don't mind me.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da.  God damn it, it actually does smell really good.  I'm going to start wearing Snooki's perfume.  You know why?  Because girls will like it.  Yes.  Girls will go, ooh, you smell wonderful.  I'll go, oh, it's a little something.  It's a little something.  They'll want to hug me.  Because girls are not afraid of being affectionate to other girls.  Right.  So if you smell like another girl...  A friend of mine wears perfume.  Damn.  And he always smells good.  Dennis from the Bunny Ranch wears Sung. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  Radar's quick, Ant.  What happened there?  I said Snooki's pregnant, and they got online, Jersey Shore star Snooki is secretly knocked  up.  Oh, wow.  It's right there.  Wow, that is fast.  Not bad, huh?  It's the internet these days.  Wow, they work fast.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, still, oh, Kenny's coming here very quickly.  Kenny?  Oh, no, he's not.  What's up?  There's reports that they're doing makeup.  What? 
[02:38:00]  Do they know this is radio?  I'll tell you what.  No, no.  Because it's being filmed.  Yeah?  That's why it's being filmed.  Do they know it's being filmed?  Why didn't they do the makeup beforehand?  Right.  They just came from TV, so...  Oh, shit.  Here comes...  Yeah, right?  Oh, I saw Sam.  Yeah.  Sam, and here they...  They're coming.  Oh, oh, okay.  This is good.  Good job.  Yeah.  They were doing their makeup.  Makeup.  Let's see how it worked.  Oh, wow.  Let's see how that worked out for them.  Does the studio smell good, Sam?  Do you smell it?  Ant. 
[02:38:30]  What does it say?  Yeah?  So that's...  I don't know.  Knocked out?  I don't know.  Explosion?  According to Dr. Steve, the Iranians use carpet makers to piece shredded documents back  together during the hostage crisis.  What?  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  I don't know.  Carpet makers.  They use Dr. Steve in the hospice to make people really happy to fucking go.  When he walks in, they're like, all right, stop fighting.  It's here.  Oh, my God. 
[02:39:00]  Look at the crowd that is here.  Why are there 40 people?  It's just astounding.  She looks good.  I don't know.  We've got to ask her about this.  Open the door.  Get confirmation today.  Come on.  Oh, come on in.  Snooki.  Here, Snooki.  Take a seat.  JWoww.  Hi.  Hi, JWoww.  How are you?  Look at these lovely ladies in our studio today.  You smell the studio?  Oh, yeah.  It smells like weed.  It smells nice.  We were just sampling.  We were spraying your shit.  Spraying your shit. 
[02:39:30]  We were just sampling some of it, and yeah, it smells good.  Thank you.  It smells very sweet and nice.  Did you?  What did you do?  Well, I started the production while we were filming, so right when we got done filming,  I went straight to the factory and did the bottle designs and the scents and stuff like that.  I actually made a pickle scent, but it smelled like shit.  Obviously, I couldn't use it.  A pickle scent.  You really tried to get away with that?  Yeah, I just wanted to see what it smelled like.  You're showing a lot of cleavage.  It's nice.  Yeah, I really don't care.  But someone's looking at them. 
[02:40:00]  You're like me.  Huh?  Yeah, yours are.  Holy mackerel.  You're both proportioned.  Is it offensive if somebody looks...  Like, I try to keep eye contact.  You try to be a gentleman, but it's hard to not peek.  It's hard to make a look.  I don't give a shit.  Everyone's human.  Yeah.  Well, you remember I was creepy last time.  Yeah.  You do look at other girls?  Yeah.  It's hard not to, right?  Of course.  Do you also make a grunting sound?  Like, I'll look and go like, ugh.  And then I'll look back up.  No, because I don't have a penis.  Okay, good.  Well, me neither.  Well, you've borrowed a few.  Right?  What does that mean?  Yeah, you had some sex with some of the guys. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, but I wouldn't say yous, though.  I would say yous.  Yeah, okay.  Well, you gave it back.  Yeah.  Use and abuse, though.  And you guys are filming a spinoff in Hoboken and said no.  It's a big story today.  I guess that's what we heard, yeah.  I thought you guys started filming, though.  It's rather big, right?  It's like the story.  Yeah.  That spread.  They love the hate.  I mean, we don't care.  I mean, if you don't want us there, whatever.  But did you start filming?  No, we start at the end of the month.  A couple weeks, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So how is this going to be a little different than Jersey Shore?  Just our lives.  We definitely don't want to show, like, the whole drinking aspect and clothing. 
[02:41:00]  Really?  So you've got ten minutes of show?  Oh, no.  You know, we're normal people.  We don't always party all the time.  It's like off the shore.  We want to show our boyfriends and our family.  You know, just a different side of us.  What do you do to prepare for the Jersey Shore?  Like right now, we're not drunk.  Right, right.  You could be.  Well, I had a drink.  Nah, that's too early.  Did you have a drink?  No.  What time do you normally start?  Like, if you're going to have a drinking day, what time would you start?  I can't.  See, she can do the day drinking.  I can, or I'll be drooling by, like, 3 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[02:41:30]  The only time that I do day drinking is if it's, like, a big event.  At the shore.  Everyone's doing it, or if I'm really hungover.  Yeah, medicinal.  And you just have a drink with breakfast.  Medicinal drink, yeah.  Like mimosa.  She has meatball day every once in a while.  Bloody Mary's.  Meatball day.  Meatball day.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Those are good, too.  Yeah.  Now, has being on Jersey Shore, like, obviously it's changed your life.  It's made you both pretty famous people.  Does it kind of give you an image that you don't like?  Like, do you want to change that by being on, doing a show that's totally different?  Yes and no.  I mean, we take it as a blessing. 
[02:42:00]  If it wasn't for the Jersey Shore, we would still be in Long Island and upstate New York doing  our own thing.  But with the Jersey Shore, you're only allowed to see one side of us.  And we just want to kind of show, like, what we do off the shore, how we are.  Because we are regular people, but we are 20-something-year-olds that go to the shore and like to have  fun, like anyone else.  But you only get to see that one side.  So I think we just want to show all aspects of us, and then you can judge.  Yeah, we had Vinny in here recently.  There's a lot of downtime, where you guys are just hanging out in the house doing nothing. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  And they're not showing any of that.  Yeah, they don't show the fun stuff where we stay in, we don't drink at all, we play cards,  we bullshit, and we have the best times of our lives when we're not going out.  Right.  But of course, they don't show that because there's no drama.  They cut the fat out.  Yeah, it's all about getting ready for karma.  Yeah.  What if you don't want to go out?  And have a meatball day.  I've been there, I haven't gone out.  You don't know what meatball day is?  Yeah, sometimes I sleep in, so.  Yeah.  Whatever.  What about, what is meatball day?  I don't know anything about it.  That's her and Dina day.  Dina.  They start drinking really early and just get fucked up. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, okay.  I haven't done that since, what, August?  Yeah.  But I mean, that's what you do during the summertime.  What else are you going to do?  Right.  Ride the rides 500 times?  Especially in the house.  Yeah, in the house it'll drive you nuts.  And it sounds like Jersey Shore is done.  No one is officially saying it, but you guys aren't ready.  Oh, no.  I guarantee, I have, there has to be one more.  There has to be one that says goodbye.  You know what I mean?  You can't just end it not knowing.  But nothing's scheduled right now, right?  No, they never do though.  It's always like a month, right?  We know like a month prior. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, okay.  We don't really have time to prep.  Right, right.  But how awful is it when people in your past start coming out and talking shit?  It's like, and you know they're just trying to get five minutes in front of a camera.  It's frustrating, right?  I haven't really had anyone do that to me.  No, you just get like a lot of friend requests from people you went to high school with.  Like, oh, I took social studies with you in sixth grade.  How satisfying is it to not remember them?  It's great, right?  And I'm like, okay.  Yeah.  What do you want me to say to that?  Well, we were like best friends. 
[02:44:00]  No, you actually did not like me.  So, oh, fuck off.  Have you been kind of fucking standoffish to people that weren't nice to you when you were  growing up?  100%.  100%.  Like, I didn't know I was going to end up here.  But I also, we grew up in very small towns in upstate New York.  And like we, even outside the show, we made it.  Like, I moved to Long Island.  I did my own thing.  And I didn't have that in high school.  Like, I don't think people knew that I was going to make it very far after high school.  And it was kind of the opposite.  The people that you thought were going somewhere now have like four kids, married, and getting  a divorce now. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Hi.  That's how it is.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Do you want to go?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Which bronzer is the best?  Because you might look at me and think that I'm very pale.  I'm Irish.  And I don't do a lot of summer.  You're not really pale.  You don't think so?  No.  You're the first person that's ever said those words to me.  You actually have color.  Oh, look at us.  You got a little, uh...  We are fairly close.  You got some rosiness to your face today, Jimmy.  Oh, that's probably just my natural joy.  It might be...  I'm a rosy cheek.  He's bloodstruck.  I'm going to tell you to do the tan maximizer.  What do I do with tan maximizer?  Do I just spray it on myself and I'm done? 
[02:45:00]  No, you lotion it before you go into the tanning bed.  Oh.  If you decide to tan.  Ah.  Okay.  What's the difference between...  Do you need a spray tan?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've never done it.  But I would like to have a nice spray tan.  I'd like to have a nice spray tan.  Oh, we should have sprayed...  Throw it on his back.  Yeah.  I can go, wow, you said you ran up.  Okay.  Yeah.  Snooki, you see Radar Online yet?  No.  What does it say?  Well, let the games begin.  Well, you guys are always in it.  You guys are always in it.  Can I read this? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Jersey Shore star Snooki is secretly knocked up.  Oh, shit.  Radar Online.  What's that?  What did you tell me?  Radar Online.  Snooki is about to drop her...  Does that mean they're calling me fat?  Her most skinless bombshell.  No, you look very good.  I think they're saying that you're really pregnant.  And Gianni's the father.  So why would they say I'm pregnant if I look...  Yeah.  That means that I have a belly hair.  I thought I was pregnant this month.  Do they accuse you guys of being pregnant all the time, really? 
[02:46:00]  Radar Online is the craziest things.  Yeah.  Like almost 40 days ago.  And I have been fluctuating.  And I've had those shows or whatever tabloids hit me up and be like,  Oh, so you're pregnant?  No, asshole.  I was pregnant with Polly once.  Yeah.  Yeah?  How'd that work out?  And I never had sex with Polly.  It's actually, at this point, insulting because we are trying to be in fitness,  but we are women.  You gain weight.  And it's just people making money off of us.  Snooki lost a lot of weight.  There's people making money off of us.  This would be the people... 
[02:46:30]  Is that rough, though, when people...  Like, you read shit that is just ruthlessly awful things that people say?  And we just have to ignore it.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I don't give a shit what I am.  Do you really not give a shit, though?  No, because in high school, I went through such a hard time getting bullied that at this  point, it's just like, shut the fuck up.  You did?  Really?  Why'd they bully you in high school?  The girls bullied me and my friends a lot.  I don't know why.  Me too.  Because chicks are cunts.  And you just got to look at it like...  They're like mean girls.  There's obviously an issue with them, or they're not happy in their own life, where they have  to, like...  Yeah, or they're really pretty.  Yeah, but... 
[02:47:00]  Or they just have to be fat, so...  That's usually the way, though.  Yeah, they just want to, like, beat someone down.  Well, those guys weren't pretty.  Yeah.  They're like, come on, the pregnancy rumors, and we're breaking up with our boyfriend rumors.  So you're saying...  I don't think it's a fat...  They're not saying you're fat.  I think that they probably heard a rumor.  Yeah.  You can't look at you and think that you look that way.  Well, that's what I'm thinking, because I've never said once I was pregnant.  So you're saying no?  Yeah.  You're saying no to this, obviously.  Okay.  There you go.  And obviously, they're calling me fat, so I hate you, baby.  Oh, no, man.  You lost a lot of weight.  And going back to the bullying thing, people forget, but when Snooki first entered the house,  you guys didn't really like her, though. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  She was the biggest bitch I've ever met.  I wasn't the biggest bitch in the house, though.  Oh, Sam was.  See?  Like Snooki.  You were in the same boat.  But the next day, I toughed it out, and I apologized.  But Snooki almost didn't survive.  You almost left, because it was a bad situation.  Yeah.  And then she turned it completely around and became one of the most popular ones.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  The guy that punched her, I ended up, like, cracking six times in a row.  I can't believe that happened.  I know.  Getting punched?  Yeah.  And it was weird how that kind of became the thing that made people want to watch it,  because it was something so you didn't expect to see a woman getting punched in a bar. 
[02:48:00]  What a dirtbag.  He suffered for that, though, as he should have.  Like, he lost his job.  He got fucked.  And supposedly, his father said, I'm the reason why his son isn't in Iraq, because of me.  Just because of his son.  I didn't tell him to punch me.  He was just stealing our shots.  Was that the first guy that's ever punched you in the face?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  And I took it like a champ.  No, I'm just saying.  Why are you surprised by that?  No, no.  I watch the show.  You could be a little crazy at the bars.  Not that guys should punch you in the face. 
[02:48:30]  I'm not saying that.  They're crazy when they're drunk, so guaranteed you're an asshole.  No, exactly.  So wait, so you never had another interaction with that guy?  No.  Okay.  What Anne's trying to say, you don't have a filter.  You speak your mind.  But that's a lot of Jersey people.  New Yorkers.  No, Snooki more than most.  You guys don't have a filter.  That's why you're on here.  No, I know.  And sometimes it gets you in trouble.  I know.  It gets you punched in the face.  Yeah, it gets you punched in the face.  Whatever.  I don't care.  Do you look back on that event as much as it sucked in the moment and go like, you  know what, it was an amazing clip even though it was a terrible moment and it could help? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, I mean, obviously when it happened, it sucked, but you know.  You could take a punch.  Yeah.  Bad.  How embarrassing for him.  She smiled though like, yeah, I can.  I'm proud of it.  Are we ever going to find out what happened with you in the situation?  It's the storyline this year.  Mike is just obsessive and he's crazy.  And I have no idea, you know, why he would say shit about me because I always had his  back.  There's rumors that, you know, Snooki might have with the situation. 
[02:49:30]  It's sad though.  He's so disgusting.  Oh, really?  We'll have to wait and see on that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be actually really funny.  What happened to him?  Did fame get to him?  Yeah.  You tell me.  He changed the most out of all you guys.  Well, he was a dickhead before.  Right.  Now he's just extremely.  He's like uber dick.  Yeah.  He saw the stuff with his father, right?  Like the stuff his dad was saying.  Was that like, was his dad being accurate about a son who's a dickhead or is his dad  just a fucking horrible guy?  Well, that's both.  It's like, yeah, that no matter whose parent that is, that's just horrible thing to do 
[02:50:00]  what he did.  I mean, family's family.  And no matter how much of a screw up you are, you should never do that to your son or mother.  Like, oh, that was awful.  Well, that had an effect on him, obviously.  Yeah.  Do you guys get money requests from people?  Like they start telling you they're like, you know, hi, like especially like, hey, she makes  X amount for a personal appearance.  And they start going, hey, could you make this appearance for me?  Could you start doing it?  Do people are asking you for money?  Huh?  Asking us for money?  Family.  Yeah.  Is family asking you for money or asking you to do appearances or things like that?  No.  The only thing that I ever had was my babysitter growing up passed away and they asked me 
[02:50:30]  to be part of that.  But that's because she was a close family friend and it would bring awareness to it.  Right.  What did she die of?  It was a murder-suicide.  Her husband killed her.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  It was actually really intense.  So you knew him too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was my aunt's next door neighbor.  Obviously, you're shocked.  But growing up, did you think like, wow, this guy's kind of fucked up?  Are you surprised?  Yeah.  He was like a weird biker dude.  And they divorced and he broke out of like some rehab center and went back and took her 
[02:51:00]  life and then took his when he was on, when she was on the phone with my cousin.  Whoa, man.  He shot her and then shot himself?  Yeah.  What now?  So her mother, who was like my grandmother, like, or my godmother, asked me like, can you  ever come up with Nicole and try and help out?  And it's like a five mile race or something like that to bring awareness.  Listen, I think I will this summer if we can.  It's always during the show. 
[02:51:30]  So I haven't been able to.  Was he with, was she with somebody else and he just couldn't handle it?  No, I think she requested, like, she filed for divorce during it.  He was, I don't know.  Wow.  It was awful.  Yeah, I was young.  I was a teenager.  That's crazy.  Have you guys had like obsessive guys?  Like, that's fascinating to me.  Women have been deal with like, especially being famous.  Like, you know, you hook up with a guy once or a guy you, you bang back in, you  know, 99 or whatever.  Now he's coming around and being creepy.  No.  Not really, no.  Thank God.  Yeah.  You don't know if guys fall in love with you and like, oh, please.  I've had a weird, like, Twitter message. 
[02:52:00]  Like, you just, like, Twitter responses.  Oh, it's Twitter.  Yeah, but nothing face to face.  You're still with Roger?  Yeah.  And she's still with Gianni.  Gianni?  So, thank God.  I mean.  Well, you're having Gianni's baby.  First dates are, yeah, right?  Yeah, supposedly.  I'm having a date actually.  How long have you been together?  Almost a year and a half.  Yeah.  How long is the longest you've ever gone out with a guy?  Five years.  Five years?  Yeah.  How long ago was that about?  Um, it was, you know.  Before the show, right?  Yeah.  It wasn't anything serious, but. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Are you looking for, uh, like, a settle down kind of guy, or?  Oh, yeah.  Gianni is definitely the one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Aw.  So.  Aw.  He's a nice guy.  Are you guys engaged?  That's all I want.  No.  But, you know, maybe that's the rumor in tomorrow.  As long as I see that ring.  That'll be tomorrow's rumor.  Now, Snooki's trying to change her image.  It's pretty obvious.  Hold on.  Let me put this ring on that one, and then we're going to start the rumor.  Aw, shit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, walk out with a ring on your finger.  Yeah, right?  They'll take a picture of that, and they'll be off and running.  So, when did your new show start? 
[02:53:00]  And how much have you gotten done of it already?  A couple weeks are starting.  Um.  They've got to find a new place to live.  I guess.  So be it.  Yeah.  What's wrong with Hoboken?  Well, how much?  That would be perfect for you guys.  Listen, I mean, we weren't even aware of Hoboken, so it was kind of a shock.  But, like, at the end of the day, what is so bad about us bringing revenue into the town?  But we want a town that wants to accept us, so so be it.  They got the dumb cake boss.  Oh, that's where Hoboken is?  I'll bet you the cake boss people put the kibosh on it. 
[02:53:30]  I don't like the cake boss.  I don't like him.  You don't?  No.  He's nice, though.  I met him.  I'm sure he's nice, but I don't like shows about cooks at all.  I don't like enough about fucking cakes.  They bug me.  I don't like the chefs.  The fucking cakes.  The whole, like, who wants to be the next amazing?  No, I don't like him.  Oh, it stinks.  Because he's a burger cook.  Our own E-Rock got a cake from the cake boss, and he said it was a shitty cake.  That's why I don't like him.  E-Rock got ripped off.  Yeah.  Just because it was a cake boss cake.  That fat guy in there.  And look at him.  You can tell he enjoys his cake.  Got a little icing in his hair right now, matter of fact. 
[02:54:00]  Hey, did you ever see that Jersey Shore knockoff?  What's the one they...  The porn?  No.  Did you see that?  The porn.  I didn't see that one.  Have you been portrayed in porn?  You haven't seen the Jersey Shore porn?  I'm too fetish-oriented.  I don't watch the fun stuff anymore.  No, you're talking about Jerseylicious?  They're all having sex together.  Jerseylicious?  They're all having sex together.  In the porn?  It's just like eight or...  Yeah.  Do they look like you at all?  No.  Was it kind of fun to watch that you're self-portrayed and put on?  No, I didn't see it.  Oh, you didn't see it?  I didn't see it.  I'll watch it.  Are you talking about Jerseylicious? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, that's the...  That was the show that sounded like a ripoff.  No, no, he said a Jerseylicious.  That's a hair show.  I know.  That has nothing to do with that.  But a lot of people saying it was a Jersey Shore thing, too.  They were trying to capitalize on your success.  Well, they have a couple of Jersey shows now.  Like Gordy Shore?  Right, Gordy Shore?  Gordy.  That's in England, I think.  You can't do that, though.  It's like, the formula's got to be right.  The people have to be right.  They're actors, I heard.  Yeah.  Are they?  That's bullshit.  Yeah, Gordy.  That's socks.  Now, what do you want to do?  Like, all right, you both have another reality show. 
[02:55:00]  But, like, I know what we want to do in radio or in stand-up.  What do you want to do after that?  Like, where do you want to kind of go?  Caribbean-wise.  No, no, but you got to want to...  I kind of want to expand my brand, because my fans definitely like the whole gaudy tackiness  of it all.  And so do I.  I like the leopard print.  And so do I.  So, you know, why not do more with that stuff?  I do like the smell of it, though.  I mean, Sammy Sweetheart promoted a perfume, which wasn't bad, but this I would actually  wear.  I'm not a homosexual, but I actually would wear this, because I think women would like 
[02:55:30]  it.  Yeah.  That's a big thing.  I think guys should start wearing female perfumes, because women are going to, you  know...  They're going to be attracted to it.  I like cologne, though.  It's kind of odd.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy, you can't do it.  Well, no, you'd be surprised.  I have good cologne as well.  That does smell good.  I can smell it from here.  It's kind of just like a mist.  But this smells good.  I don't like musk.  No, musk stinks.  It's awful.  You don't like Jovan musk?  Musk all over.  Yeah, it's hideous.  I kind of like this.  We got to wrap up, because they're really busy, but we're learning that Snooki is denying 
[02:56:00]  that she's pregnant.  Of course.  They need a new place for their reality show, because Hoboken sucks a dick.  You said it, not me.  And we got the bronzer stuff.  How do we get this stuff?  You can get my tanning lotion at any salon.  Really?  Any salon?  Any tanning salon.  Damn.  And she sells tanning lotion, too.  How come we don't have any of your stuff?  Yeah, why aren't you talking about yours?  I don't know.  I'm behind the times right now.  Do you keep up with everything that's being done on this, or do you just have people...  Like, do you say, like, all right, look, what's the bottle look like?  Is it going out to all the stores, or do you have people just do that? 
[02:56:30]  We design...  I design mine.  Yeah.  You definitely want to know what's going on with your product.  Do you keep an eye on your money, too?  You just want to slap your name on it.  Do you like...  Can you log online and look at your money?  Yeah, I make sure my dad keeps an eye on it, because I want it to stay.  Don't trust anybody.  Yeah, go on.  For my future kids.  My future kids.  Of course she's close to it.  She tried to come up with a pickle one, and it didn't work.  Yeah, that's a...  A pickle?  Well, you said you went with the pickle scent or whatever.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She tried it.  Really funny story.  When I was a kid, and I would go out to the diner with my grandmother, I would ask for everybody's pickles, apparently. 
[02:57:00]  Real pickles?  You just went to that day, didn't you?  God damn, Jimmy.  Yeah, I just wanted to...  The only way you would get away with that.  I love how you prefaced that with funny stories.  I just wanted to end the segment on a really, really cool story about my childhood.  You're an asshole.  Well, did we get all the plugs out?  Anything else you guys want to mention?  We know you've got to go.  Thursday, 10 p.m. MTV.  Right.  Of course.  And look for the new show.  Thank you, guys.  What is the name of the new show?  I don't know. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, you got to ask.  Shirley Times.  No idea.  2012.  Who knows?  I'm starting to think they don't have a new show.  It's JWoww and Snooki.  Snooki, thanks for doing our show, finally.  Yeah.  We've had JWoww here.  Yeah, we've had everybody else on.  The only one we haven't had is Ronnie.  What's up with him?  We were with him yesterday.  I've never laughed so hard in my life.  Really?  Yeah.  He's around.  He doesn't really do press, though.  But he's here.  Is he?  Yeah, he's staying out in L.A., but he's around if we can get a hold of him.  We have Vinny on a few times.  He's really good.  Ronnie's a riot.  You've got to have Ronnie.  Well, Vinny's a downer, though.  Let's be honest with that depression thing. 
[02:58:00]  Vinny's what?  With his fucking anxiety now.  I have a question, though.  Just kidding.  When we walk out, you guys are going to talk shit about us again?  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Were we talking shit?  That's kind of why I never did it, because you guys were mean.  We were mad you didn't do our show.  We were mad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to do the show.  Oh, I didn't say no.  We thought you were blowing us off.  No.  I'm glad this came up.  Yeah, sometimes what will happen is-  We wanted you on the show.  We'll request somebody.  Hey, will so-and-so do it?  And then they do a bunch of other shows on the platform, and they just don't do this show.  And nothing has been said, and a lot of times it's a publicist, or it is what it is. 
[02:58:30]  And then we're like, why would that person-  Yeah, I don't have control.  But I'm going to say, but that's what it is.  You guys had a weirdo here that kept texting me.  Yes.  Who?  Steve.  You remember that?  Steve Wills.  Oral producer.  Steve, oral producer.  Steve C?  And I was scared down.  I want to come on.  Oh, you had to change your phone number.  He's no longer around.  I forgot about that.  But Snooki, you don't think some of the stuff you do on your show kind of opens you up for people  to kind of goof on you and kind of make fun?  Oh, no, I don't care about that.  But I mean, come on, it's been three years now. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, we're hearing the same shit from two years ago.  And being sluts and orange.  Wait, we got a problem with Snooki?  No.  We good?  I don't have a problem with Snooki.  It's over now.  How about we go with, it was a misunderstanding?  There's no misunderstanding.  We wanted her on the show.  Unfortunately, the reruns are still running.  So even though things change, you can tune in for the first time, see something and go,  this chick's out of her fucking mind.  What did you hear that we said?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:59:30]  A lot of Twitter stuff.  And I'm like, you know.  Twitter stuff.  Oh, that's Opie.  Oh, that's me.  Opie is constantly tweeting nasty shit about people.  I tweet good stuff.  I'm funny, Twitter guy.  What did I say?  Oh, I don't remember.  It was a while ago.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Thank God.  We'll have to look into that.  No, because now they're going to remind you of what I said.  Yes, everybody.  No, they're going to remind you.  And now we're good.  Wait, was Steve sending you texts that were like sexy in nature, but putting LOL at the  end of them?  Is there anything creeper?  Don't you hate those?  When someone does that?  Suck my dick, LOL.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Maybe we can hang out or something, R-O-F-L.  Who's laughing at that?  No one.  What if I tweet I love Snooki?  Would that be good?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That's a little too intense.  We just met.  It's not love in that way.  And now you're like, you're kind of a new Snooki for the new year.  No, just not drunk.  Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, okay.  You do come off as like, when you drink, you come off as like a problem.  Because I'm wasted.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  When we film, we have no cell phone, no internet, no TV.  What else are you going to do?  That's crazy.  Who else are you going to talk to?  Believe me, I have all that stuff and I still drink.  Yeah, Vinny talked about that stuff.  Just imagine just being around people drunk with none of those vices to do anything with.  I can't imagine not having a phone for an hour.  You guys had to hand over your phones for what?  Four months.  Four months.  That's why alcohol is our best friend.  Do you out drink guys, Snooki?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Most guys?  Uh-huh.  How is that possible?  You're a little thing.  I have no idea.  I don't know what goes on. 
[03:01:00]  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  If I did a quarter of what she did.  And I never get hangovers.  I never throw up when I drink.  Oh, man.  It's a miracle.  And she could keep going.  Like, she starts at 11.  She can go to 11 the next day.  Yeah, I know.  It's amazing.  It's the meatball day.  Yeah.  I've seen every show.  I think it's meatball in me.  Can I say I really like Snooki?  Really?  Yeah.  Is that good?  Yeah, it's nice.  How about this?  I like Snooki a lot.  I want to bury the hatchet right now.  But these assholes are going to remind you of what has been said.  I like Snooki a lot.  But don't forget to put a space between A and lot. 
[03:01:30]  Because it's creepy when you make it one word.  Oh, really?  It's a Steve thing, if you do A.  Yes, Steve is.  You're never going to forget Steve.  L-O-L.  All right, we're saying this thing.  They have to leave.  They have other press.  They have busy girls today.  He's going to sue me now, okay?  Well, you didn't say his name.  You didn't mention incompetence or any of this.  All right.  You know, JWoww and Snooki, you know, Jersey Shore, we really don't need to promote that  10 o'clock on Thursdays, which is tonight.  It's a good season.  On MTV.  Absolutely a good season.  Vinny's back.  Thank you, Goyles.  And I now smell good. 
[03:02:00]  Thank you.  It's Jenny Woww with two W's at the end and Snooki, obviously, on Twitter.  So, there you go.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  And we're done for the day, so we can't even talk bad about it even if we want to.  We have to wait until tomorrow.  We'll wait until tomorrow, yeah.  All right.  You're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. </pre>
