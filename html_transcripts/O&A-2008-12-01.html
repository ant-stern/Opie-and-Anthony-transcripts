<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, featuring Rich Vos and Jimmy Norton in place of the honeymooning Opie, opened with a recap of Opie's recent wedding in Philadelphia.  The hosts detailed humorous moments from the ceremony, held in a church used in *The Sixth Sense*, including the unusual gospel music, their distant seating arrangement (behind a pillar), and Patrice O'Neal's attire.  Brother Wease's microphone check ("Is this thing on?") and a subsequent text exchange during the ceremony were recounted. Vos described a disastrous gambling trip to the Borgata, involving significant losses and angry outbursts, including spitting on the casino floor.  The show announced its removal from Boston airwaves.  A discussion about an inappropriate *Diff'rent Strokes* clip veered into tangents about Patrice O'Neal's girlfriend, the definition of gambling, and Vos' recent purchases.

The broadcast continued with a conversation about a poorly attended Thanksgiving dinner, transitioning into the hosts' Christmas shopping habits, culminating in one host buying his daughter a car.  This led to a discussion of Black Friday, focusing on a Walmart incident where a shopper was trampled to death, with the hosts reacting to videos of the event. The main focus shifted to the hosts' recent purchase of two 50-caliber Desert Eagles, accompanied by videos demonstrating the gun's power and showcasing accidental self-inflicted injuries.  One host boasted about buying all the available ammunition.  The conversation touched on gun control, Obama's stance on firearms, and the hosts' rationale for purchasing the guns before potential legislative changes. One host detailed a recent hair plug procedure, including the pain and resulting scabbing.

The show then discussed a Canadian court ruling granting obese people free extra airplane seats, sparking debate on fairness and personal responsibility.  Gene Simmons' frustration with KISS's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame exclusion was mentioned, followed by criticism of Opie's absent musical cues.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Plaxico Burress' accidental self-shooting and a brief mention of Tom Jones, ending with an anecdote about a past party.  Jimmy Norton was the only in-studio guest besides the hosts.

A significant portion of the broadcast featured an in-studio interview with Tom Jones.  The conversation covered his career, including anecdotes about his early career in the UK, Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars, his ABC variety show, and censorship on Ed Sullivan's show.  The discussion included his musical collaborations, longevity, and touring.  The interview contained significant sexually explicit banter, touching upon Jones' past sexual encounters, the number of women he's slept with, and questions about intergenerational sexual activity.  Jokes about Jones' penis size and tight pants were also made.  The conversation shifted to the hosts' personal lives, specifically Anthony's marriage and its effect on his sex life, as well as the challenges of having children.  The segment ended with a discussion about a deleted audio clip of a host stammering while speaking to Tom Jones. Tom Jones' songs "I'm Alive" and "Give a Little Love" were played during the segment.

The final segment centered on a discussion about Steve, the show's producer, and his habit of deleting audio, leading to a broader exploration of the show's internal dynamics.  The hosts used vulgar and offensive language, debating Steve's sensitivity, perceived lack of respect, and reactions to on-air ribbing.  They reflected on past bullying experiences.  A lengthy anecdote about Rich Vos's encounter with Chaz Palminteri was shared, along with a discussion of a difficult commercial read by Anthony ("Bosch Micro Edge Excel Wiper Blades").  The hosts made offensive jokes targeting each other and various groups.  Steve's recent divorce and work stress were mentioned, along with promotion of Vos's upcoming stand-up gigs and the Opie and Anthony pay-per-view event.  The segment concluded with listener calls for the "What Did We Learn?" segment, featuring more vulgarity and personal anecdotes.

[00:06:30]  yeah at the beginning of our thanksgiving uh holiday and it was in philly um and uh it was  like i like i was saying uh lindsey looked great uh i'm done with weddings though i'm done with  weddings i i don't like the whole wedding thing i wasn't even involved in this one either like  everyone's like why aren't you uh you know on the on the crew on the wedding crew i was like  i'm glad i didn't want to be and then the seating i got i got a little bone to pick with opi i have 
[00:07:00]  an issue over the seating too the seating was we i was behind a concrete pillar and could not see  anything my back was to it so even if i was facing it and the pillar wasn't there i uh it would have  been hard to see fos do you want to ask the pillar why he didn't just turn it over and sleep on the  other side it was just i was i was being blocked by a giant pillar and uh i was at a table the the table 
[00:07:30]  set up where where all of the guests were i think they just put names in a hat and threw them out  like i we we were like i wanted to sit with jimmy yes and uh you know all my pals and i was with ron  and fez which was fine um but then like travis was at my table which was okay but i would rather have 
[00:08:00]  jimmy at my table and and uh danny of course i would rather have at the table because i hang with  danny a lot like you should know you know who we're hanging with usually or at the tables next  to each other next to each other yeah there was a table like i was at the table with ron and fez  and then there was a table in between and then there was the table with patrice and uh jimmy i'm like  what why the hell you guys should put that table next to us you guys were almost in the kitchen  i was the furthest away from where everything was going on it was the table furthest away from 
[00:08:30]  everything you were at the undesirables yes was it the the the table that uh they would have put  like dave at they put a couple with us uh well tom was at the table first it was rich and bonnie it  was patrice and his girl yeah with me in an empty seat they should have put you guys next to our table  though at least we could have kind of leaned over and gotten a few chuckles and some and uh then there  was a football tyson walter and his wife who was fine yeah who hates him and uh she had you know 
[00:09:00]  bigger dreams and and then beat your ass i know you will what do you mean classical burris  yeah hold this and then some couple and we're talking i mean we're just talking what we talk  just filthy human oh some random couple was thrown in there i know lindsey's dad at one point  came over he's like look i know you guys don't know i forget what their names they're good people  just talk to him a little bit get to know him he's trying to be like boy get everybody to know each 
[00:09:30]  other yeah yeah and he literally could have been saying hey there's an apple in there you might want  to go pick it up and talk to it not that they were bad people i don't know him right i don't talk to  yeah this is kind of a uh kind of a mood when when the table's all comics you're going to talk about  things you usually talk about when you're hanging out and then to throw a random couple in there  it's bad for everyone involved especially with patrice too because he knows everything so no matter 
[00:10:00]  what he's gonna start giving that couple advice she's gonna want to end up leaving him yeah you know  yeah he was saying things and and and uh what's his name the football player's wife was just looking  at him going is this man really for real the stuff he said about women you know that their value is all  about their looks well yeah yeah patrice has his uh logic as far as uh and reason but as far as  relationships going uh on the show it works great amongst the comics it works great and even the 
[00:10:30]  listeners and everything but amongst people that don't know him he kind of comes off like a lunatic  he's wearing a pimp hat and his girlfriend has a black eye so what are you gonna expect on the show  he's uh he's he's great and he's a brilliant comic and at weddings he's just a spoiler of fun  and a ruiner of relationships so bony and i are talking about the first time like the first set  the first night i met her the second night i met her the things i did in the car with her 
[00:11:00]  yeah you know that involved my face you know of course we're talking about this at the table like  it's a normal thing and the couple is just staring at us going the second time he met her in the car  he's doing they were horrified they were watching the rest of the table like it was a giant screening  of two girls one cup they were mortified at the language the the dismissive nature in which we  shut up when we talk to each other yeah it what you're you aren't the most uh courteous people to 
[00:11:30]  each other but it's fun it's what you guys do and if you just throw a random couple in there  they they're not gonna get it and all the all the waiters look like there was something crooked  about their heads or something wrong with them and we had this one really gay guy and and i just said  can i have uh coffee and i call him cookie you know and he got so mad my name is ed or something  all right cookie just get me a coffee he was a very slight man he was a very he was the waiter  with the look the waiter with the tiny head there was it was it was almost like a little child had 
[00:12:00]  put on a big waiter's uniform i was fixed i was just fixated on the uh the lesbian waiter oh god oh god  oh joe pesci every time he came back i thought of somebody else she made rose she made rosie look  feminine yeah that was the manliest woman uh yeah i was fixated on that one i i wasn't able to really  uh uh mingle with the homosexual gentleman uh waiter yeah the seating i had issue when ope gets back 
[00:12:30]  we're going to discuss the seating the seating was one thing but uh let's bring it back even further  and go to the church okay uh the church uh was of course beautiful one of those full church mass  weddings uh i then i found out later the church was a set for a location for a movie  six cents that is the sixth sense church i i did not know that yes iraq iraq uh if you would 
[00:13:00]  ron uh made a point of telling everybody that this was the church as everyone's leaving after the  ceremony he's like you know what this is six cents church yeah i didn't know that i i would have you  taken some pictures uh with my iphone instead of texting uh texting everybody during the ceremony  uh if if i knew that was the church but patrice walks in and uh there wasn't one person surprised  at his get-up and i will call it a get-up it was a black tie event this wedding which i guess to some 
[00:13:30]  people constituted a budweiser jacket i saw some one gentleman in front of me had a budweiser jacket on  someone else was pretty much just came in their pjs one guy was in sweatpants sweatpants black tar  wait a minute what does that have to do nothing he just was trying to think of a t-word i know  you know like hot tar we got it for hot tar yeah it still is terrible why would the guy in sweat  pants he went with the flow it wouldn't no one would realize no one wears sweatpants when they're 
[00:14:00]  tarring a roof no one wears something a little more durable no one no one complains about a pillar  okay big deal well i couldn't see from behind i didn't have an x-rated vision you tell somebody  else i want to sit at that side of the table i wasn't going to sit while you think i was going  to tell opie anything about that wedding you think i was going to suggest anything with the state of  mind he was in uh before the wedding the the weeks before the wedding he was uh mr stress i was i was  going to go oh by the way i don't like my table voss they remind me the seats that voss got us for 
[00:14:30]  the trump roast like uh just behind the pillar out of the way yeah yeah keep them out of the way  yeah rumor has it anthony had to watch the uh the reception on a screen yeah yeah i couldn't see the  actual reception i watched it on on a screen that was a delay there's a delay on there the uh yeah  the seating chart was was done just moments before uh the reception just moments before they  were still scrambling and figuring out who was going to be sitting where we should have been at 
[00:15:00]  the same table yes and i should have been at the same table but that was also because like for  other people too not just us well they wanted other people to have fun tables and let's be honest  we're the big gets yes we are the big gets you're the biggest get and in that rotten situation i'm  the second biggest you we i think we are just the big gets i would take you not even with false  humility i would take anthony first i would proudly uh take a second to aunt uh they wanted to spread us  out a little bit and they figured ron and fez they probably could have spread a little bit too they 
[00:15:30]  could have put yeah yeah fez at another table with fez it was like dining with the captain of a ship  he had that big beard on that gray beard he looked like the you had to get up and steer the titanic  like ahead of the white star line his big beard yeah patrice's outfit i gotta get back to that get  up he everybody was saying i wonder what he's going to show up in and he shows up uh wearing his his uh hat  a fedora like a velvet fedora and some type of velvety suit jacket and uh his girl showed up 
[00:16:00]  and just bam his girl is bam yeah i know she's very sexy right my wife was sitting right behind him  you know in the pew behind him and she's going look at her ass my wife is you know she was coming bonnie  was commenting i couldn't believe how round and solid her ass is it's fair i gotta be honest even though  that's patrice's girl i i know her well enough to say it it really is awe-inspiring it's perfect  yeah i told him i asked him on the phone he has a perfect girlfriend he talks a lot about the fact 
[00:16:30]  that he doesn't um deserve her in the pure physical sense like like why is she but then yeah yeah exactly  i'm breaking new ground here but uh then he starts talking about her place in the relationship and  things and people that listen to the show have heard it it's just ridiculous that she's ever with him  like what what type of self-esteem problem does she have that she stays with him when he just talks  like that right in front of her he reminds her of somebody he reminds her of a conflict she's working 
[00:17:00]  out in the past and when that conflict gets worked out we're gonna have one sad fat man on our hands  like i don't think he understands how good he has it yeah he's beautiful look at her yeah  he talks a great game but the second she's gone does he think he's gonna be able to hook up again  like that what didn't you like about his outfit the fact that he should have been swinging a watch  and had keep on trucking written under him yeah he's zoot suit meanwhile at the church as he's as  he's walking in he sees all of us you know the staff and everything in tuxes yeah so he's surprised 
[00:17:30]  and he's pointing and laughing at us yeah yeah in my nice three-piece tux thank you keith and then  you know patrice shows up with his mustard tie on with a mustard colored tie and his uh fedora i know  and that too by the way uh let's bring up uh gospel music i was very uh taken by the selection  of music in the church i walked in i was uh i was ready for a typical wedding uh and a white wedding 
[00:18:00]  white wedding and i i walk in to uh gospel music being sung by black gospel singers up in the balcony  they were good though their voices were great rich they all are they musical people rich yes  the singing the gospel music it was baptist music it was what that is gospel yeah baptist like a  baptist church yes i can't even argue with you on that because i don't know there was about we were  on the floor same thing and the choir was up and they were good i mean they were up on a there was 
[00:18:30]  a wraparound balcony around the entire church it was really an odd looking church but very nice  and i was looking because the whole gospel choir was looking over at the wedding at one point  and i said to whoever i was sitting next to that it looked like a court scene from the 1950s  all the white people on the bottom all the black people on top because there was a time when they  stopped singing yeah patrice had a great point too about how uh it was a a catholic ceremony so there 
[00:19:00]  was all the sadness and jesus dying stuff and uh all that but then with the gospel it was like you  and jesus died for our sins oh happy day oh happy day oh and you're like this it's kind of a weird  juxtaposition going on here that i don't quite understand see all the all the pictures in that  church too were like jesus being dragged with a you guys got to let go because i mean it's really 
[00:19:30]  depressing oh being a jew in the catholic church yeah no there's plenty of pictures of jesus suffering  in catholic churches uh i mean it's not a happy moment going there no no it's not meant to be  you're not supposed to uh feel good or happy when you leave church for some reason they say it's a  good spiritually uplifting thing but you walk in there and wherever you look there is a gentleman  just being nailed on the cross carrying the cross it's all about just suffering 
[00:20:00]  yeah yeah what they show christ in a buick looking out the window with a smile yeah just kind of happy  maybe maybe some of the earlier days where he's building a table i'm just feeling good about sanding  the top nicely on the third tee yes on the third tee here's christ watching the apostle paul step in  dog logs yeah and just laughing with the apostles one of the apostles falls down and they they just laugh  walks into a glass door oh there weren't any oh wow we have oh look at that oh what is this music 
[00:20:30]  40 minutes later 40 minutes later and how about the gospel music that would have been nice  why didn't you put gospel music  well that would have that would have been perfect fitting when i was talking about gospel music  well you know opie's not here to give a glaring look at iraq of hatred and uh put the fear of god  into him it's this is it's like the substitute teacher's in for you iraq you're just gonna f off 
[00:21:00]  all day because the real teacher isn't here was looking for the song they were singing i think what  do you think all the listeners were at the church they were all there and would have known i think  patrice was wearing the suge knight collection it did look very okay very good it did look very  suge knight very suge knightish we uh we must take a break okay i'm sorry to say but uh don't go  anywhere we'll be back and of course the number 877-212-ONDA 
[00:21:30]  oh and a 877-212-ONDA if you uh want to call up uh it's the opie and anthony program  picking out my favorite bands uh on purpose yes hi it's the opie and anthony show hello opie's uh  on his honeymoon so we're just kind of we're here any who with rich voss standing in 
[00:22:00]  and jimmy norton discussing the wedding yeah we were talking about uh op's wedding opie is uh he's  married now he's a married guy uh and and we were talking about the seating arrangements and how far  away i couldn't have been further away from the action like i i would think i'm not and i don't know  how entirely unhappy i am with that uh because i kind of like being in the back of the classroom kind  of a thing yeah but i was so far away it was a pretty big room and i was so far away and behind 
[00:22:30]  uh structures that i couldn't see anything like when they were dancing for the first time i had to  get up out of my chair and peer around the uh the pillar and i still really couldn't see anything  it was uh i will honestly say and i without prejudice i i will say it's the best wedding i've  been to because there was a lot of cheesy stuff that wasn't done yeah oh okay yeah yeah they they 
[00:23:00]  kind of yeah put the kibosh on some of the uh cheese on some of the stuff that makes you want  to vomit at a wedding yeah uh like you know i wish they would have served the dinner within four  hours of our arrival that that cheesy thing but aside from that i mean they really didn't uh they  didn't cheese it up which i like a lot you know what got me though uh ron bennington from the ron  and fez show uh he was trying his best to bring cheese into it was he uh yeah he at one point got a  conga line going because no one no one at obi's wedding was going to do the conga line it's cheesy 
[00:23:30]  it's stupid it's it's so hack and uh ronnie just gets him and goes come on everybody grab some girl  by the hips and yeah or or fez one or the other and started conga lining around the room uh so he  he was trying his best to keep the cheese factor in it but uh there was no um uh the bride cuts the  cake song no there was no uh garter thing right where they did the garter and then the throwing 
[00:24:00]  of the garter and all that happy horse crap no chicken dance chicken dance or slide or none of  that cheesy crap the music with the band that was great i felt like my old aunt i kept saying the  band's a little loud the the band was playing nothing but like old music they they i don't know  if they stepped it up uh brought it into the 70s at one point but it was mostly like 40s music  they were good they had good voices of course you thought so yes we were in high school when those 
[00:24:30]  songs were written yeah no cotton-eyed joe was being played thank god but um yeah it was uh it was  it was a very typical of how i know opie that it was his wedding like they turned the mics off  during the exchange of the vows which was a little odd but that's the opie said he goes i just kind of  want this private little moment thing going on here you know i didn't want to uh to blast it out 
[00:25:00]  over the whole church so they all you kind of just heard them kind of mumbling back and forth to each  other i really wanted to hear the vows i so wanted to hear the vows isn't that why you go  that's the main stuff yes church to hear the people lying to each other that's the best part  i promised it do you  i said i guess i think at mine do you do you say i guess no i said something dumb it was so i i was 
[00:25:30]  the best man at this last wedding and uh there's one part where rich's wedding yes yes less people  confuse and think you're the best man at opie's no no no opie's best man was his brother scott  he did a good job he actually had a really good toast yeah he's laughing it it was touching it  wasn't uh it was very good uh nowhere near as quality as the the toast i gave at voss's but on me  um i'm kidding of course it was uh voss had to repeat something what was the woman there was a 
[00:26:00]  woman who married she's canadian and she looked like b arthur and she married voss and bonnie  and i forget what she was called but you had to repeat what she said and his mushed mouth  incompetent and bumbling through what she said everyone in the wedding just kind of hated him  for it for his complete really inability the um uh also also at the uh sorry i got distracted i had  to send uh idiot on a mission uh david five people get up yeah there's somebody at the door that has 
[00:26:30]  to get in and um there you go oh my god he still didn't know oh jesus no he didn't i i showed him  the text and he didn't even read it he walked i just received a text text saying i'm at the front  door and can't get in because i don't have a card so instead of interrupting the show i thought i would  continue show the text to david so he could read it and then realize someone had to go to the door  he passed by it and gave it a fleeting glimpse and kept walking he is the dumbest of the dumb 
[00:27:00]  who do you think you're showing it to sam and like he's 20 feet away how's he gonna read a  little iphone text is a moron thought it was how you prayed you wrote things down and held them up  and god read them david's a boob but he's a but he thinks he's so important he's well i know it's  almost he's walking i thought he was your boss for a second yeah well he will be eventually what  happened it's it is the media we work in so i what we saying about the wedding that we were saying 
[00:27:30]  about the wedding yes yes and of course we uh got thrown off track by um david the toast yeah oh the  toast was nice yeah yeah the toast is very nice but i couldn't see that really either because i was  behind a stone pillar um it was somebody else that brought oh oh uh yeah here was something that  happened in the church um brother weese was there oh yes who uh uh obviously uh very important uh as  far as opie's career goes we've heard about brother weese for for many years he went up and did uh i 
[00:28:00]  guess the reading that goddamn letters to the corinthians or from the corinthians whatever i don't  know what that is but uh he went up and the first thing he did he gets up and it's a long walk from the  pew up to the microphone he had to go all the way around the altar and everything it took a while yes  and he finally reaches the um little pulpit area with the microphone and grabs the sides 
[00:28:30]  of the podium and leans in and goes is this on  and it was it was like uber silence it went beyond quiet  and uh yeah all i feel about three minutes later is a vibration in my pocket which is my iphone 
[00:29:00]  and um i pull it out and check the text that came in and it is from my pal jimmy norton  and it just says is this thing on and then in quotes crash  and then the whole thing just turned into a texting match between the entire show staff  dude somebody pointed out the laugh and i'm sure we would have laughed if somebody had 
[00:29:30]  a car crash on their phone oh and had played the car crash and right at that moment it would  have been it would have been the biggest laugh you've ever heard anything get because it was pure  unadulterated silence church silence church silence not even that little low mumbling in church silence  everyone was completely just taken by the fact that that was not funny 
[00:30:00]  it was it was so all right here's here's how i put this how i should have with the with the with the  all right is this thing on  no oh okay okay all right uh take two uh uh and now with the reading of the letter from the of the  corinthians brother wheeze  that's the walk up it's taking a while 
[00:30:30]  is this thing on  a letter from paul to the corinthians  he didn't know he was reading till he got there he was sitting next to me did he really  no way i'm not lying you know from the seating thing i don't doubt it he didn't know he was  reading i was getting scared that i was going to be and now anthony is going to come up and juggle 
[00:31:00]  yes he said a read off from a read off oh jesus sorry from mein kampf no of course i was gonna say  a reading from goebbels to the corinthians  i said a read off because i'm talentless a reading from hitler to his incompetent generals  how dare you defy me and then he goes and sits down again  he was just looking at the uh you know the what do you call it the program there were programs that 
[00:31:30]  were handed out the program and he saw he goes he saw his name and he was he was like oh and he  had to open the show i mean he was like the first reader too yeah yeah that was the big opener and  you know it had to be scary i mean you're up top there that wasn't like i mean he was up there like  that's where the pope probably goes when he's in town that you know whatever he's the radio guy dude  he's he's fine with reading he probably just like to have a little he wasn't a little notice maybe  and and not you know something it's just something about radio guys because i tried the same thing 
[00:32:00]  at some dopey awards show uh where you try to make a joke and it just doesn't work it was it was  like watching one of your buddies because uh you know his show is back on by the way they're back  on in rochester yes it's funny that one of your friends makes a joke and it bombs and it was just  funny it was like oh yeah it could have been any one of us that went up there and said something  that bombed and would have been yeah and the but the only response we had was dead silence we couldn't  go like that you know so it was just this dead silence which was uh very uncomfortable because it's 
[00:32:30]  the church yeah then we just started like i said just text bombing each other about everything in  the church and the gospel of course i had some comments about the gospel singers  hoping none of those texts got intercepted but it was uh for a church ceremony it was uh  it was uh ope looked pretty together like i'll say this i didn't know how he was gonna be like  he looked a little tell he was nervous nervous yeah but better than i thought he'd be yeah yeah like 
[00:33:00]  and once it was over once we got to the the we actually went back to the uh hotel for a little  while it was the ritz carlton in philly and from the church we had like a two hour time to get  cocktails or whatever or some of us got massages with releases um that's what some of us did yeah  who those people were some of us had at 6 15 to be down at the reception by seven had a massage girl  come in and by uh by 6 58 we're uh we're cleaning things out of their belly button going i gotta go 
[00:33:30]  kenny get up here i don't know how to fix my cummerbund with his smelly chlorine smelling  cummerbund yeah i had no idea how to fix it squishing out of the top like space food yeah  so it was uh that was what i did on my little break yeah and uh i forget what i was gonna say  yeah we were all uh gathering at the hotel for uh oh that's okay sign that i don't know what that  is what is he signing danny just uh he's he's he's handed me a breakfast my breakfast order 
[00:34:00]  joe's just joe's new dude you're in the middle of the you come around this round me and enter talking  and the new the new intern he stepped right in the middle of our conversation just walks in the  middle of our conversation i don't how do you have a i'm not saying that we should be revered as saints  but yes but you know we are conversing on a national radio show here i don't know why  i don't know how do you guys why would paco from bad boys i know how do you walk right in the middle 
[00:34:30]  how do you get 40 year old interns you guys gotta be like in his 30s we got it  not gonna laugh no he really doesn't look all that old no he doesn't he first tried to explain  no that's why i didn't laugh if he looked if he looked old i would have laughed right all right  maybe yeah i don't know what you're talking about i like the fact that voss said in his 40s and no  one laughs because he looks like he's in his 30s oh looks like you know does he yeah i mean he could  be in his 20s he just keeps going backwards yeah we went into back into the uh the reception was at 
[00:35:00]  the ritz call and so there was a small room that we were supposed to go into to have drinks but we  decided to go to the bar because it was better better selection yeah you know a few of the people  i was with uh like you know danny and uh whatnot we need we need our uh booze need our booze so we  went in there and uh started our drinking immediately following the ceremony even though the reception  wasn't going to start for another three hours yeah so we started drinking it really was an event 
[00:35:30]  yeah what the whole weekend was uh especially for us because i went to the borgata  before the wedding uh we took a car down to the borgata to do a little gambling uh which  gambling i assume gambling means there's a chance you're going to win so i didn't do gambling i made  a giant contribution to the new wing over at the borgata oh wow oh didn't get any better oh  hey opie that wing is opie didn't get a gift that's how bad it was i used every last dime i had 
[00:36:00]  on me and and the the bag that i had keith guarding oh so much on the way in was just tossed on top of  the rest of the baggage on the way out oh yeah they they cleaned me out pretty pretty uh pretty good  uh and then i i was smart i went back after the wedding hoping to make it all back that's what  gamblers do of course and um uh wow uh didn't quite uh didn't quite do that either did you get any of 
[00:36:30]  it back it's like no did you give more away oh yeah it's like it's like walking into the cell i'll show  him for what he did i'm gonna happen yeah yeah i'm gonna show him yeah they might have gotten me on  the way in but i'll get him on the way back uh wow uh the dealers were were magical they if i had a  20 they were pulling up 21s uh there was there was a hand uh uh in particular where if you get dealt a 
[00:37:00]  couple of twos and the dealer has a four showing you split your twos so i may sound like a novice  yes yes jimmy but if that happens can you yell deuces wild i don't know if that's right or wrong  yes see that's a secret most people don't know and then you call them threes yes do something  stupid you yell deuces wild you pick him up and you run around the table going  see no one knew that 
[00:37:30]  what happened when you split your deuces well you split your deuces because the deal is showing a four  and you're thinking he's gonna break you know so you split the deuces and another deuce comes out  so now when you split your deuces you got to put up another bet yeah you double your bet  so you got to put down another one and then when you split again because the third deuce comes up  you put up the bet again now the card comes out on top of the first deuce it's a 10 so there's 12  that's not good that's not very good at all then the second card comes out it's a 10 there's another 12 
[00:38:00]  the third card comes out it's a nine now you have 11 so you place now a fourth bet down on this  disaster uh because you have an 11 and double down now you get one card but since you have an 11 odds  are a 10 comes out and you have 21 what comes out wait and hold on you double down on on an 11 on 11  on the one bet yeah you have the you have two 12s two 12s and an 11 so the 11 you double down on 
[00:38:30]  yes that's going now double down now there's four of the original bet is on that table and um an ace  comes out making the third and final 12 but hey no no you could have made it 22 hope isn't lost oh  hope isn't lost because the deal has a four showing so that's you know under normal circumstances  they would turn over that 10 have a 14 turn over another 10 bust and i win all my four bets but of 
[00:39:00]  course the dealer turned over um a six making a 10 and then the ever-present and all-knowing king  comes out to give the dealer a 20 that's great so you got a 22 and they had a 20 you win  see it doesn't quite work that way oh um that was how every hand went every hand and uh boy was i 
[00:39:30]  um letting the dealer and everybody in the area know uh that i was not happy with the way i was  being dealt were you being a sore sport i was being what they call a sore loser uh at one point keith  was looking for me after i stormed off in anger uh keith was looking for me and he went into the  high roller area and stepped up to the top of the stairs and everyone just turned around and went  he's not here like they all knew i wasn't there because it was quiet and they all were all like 
[00:40:00]  if you find him don't bring him back here kind of a thing did the casino want you back there well  of course but the people you know i kind of turned into whiny anthony when uh whiny spitting anthony  yes at one point some poor gentleman whose only job it is is to uh polish the floors at the borgata  uh for probably minimum wage was polishing the floor uh at the exit uh way to the high roller section 
[00:40:30]  and as i walked out i made a point of spitting right in front of him on the floor i spit on the  floor in front of him and gave him a look like yeah clean it up were you were you trying to help  him polish the floor yes a spit shine yeah you should see the way they call you to call him spit  shine sammy makes the florida borgata like mirrors like mirrors you love it now go get your broom  go get your shine spit was a dealer when like when he was busting you yeah was he making a face like 
[00:41:00]  oh i wish you were winning dude if if they had an emotion those people that deal uh it would be one  thing but they're emotionless monsters they're cyborgs they're uh they have no emotion so uh i just i  lost and and felt very poorly during the time uh i was leaving but i get over it quickly i rationalize  it like well you know what was i gonna buy a car you know yeah we gotta uh take another break 
[00:41:30]  all right but uh oh just hours more of merriment so uh don't go anywhere what's that number again  it's a one eight seven seven two one two oh and a that's what you gotta call eight seven seven two  one two six two six three we'll be back with more of the opian anthony show good morning opian anthony  show here with uh jimmy norton of course my compadre compadre my compatriot my comrade and uh rich 
[00:42:00]  voss the uh guy we get when we can't get another comic i got to the v's and i guess after you it was a  it was it was ted willison i was gonna come in i'll be at i'll be at bananas in cincinnati ohio this  weekend go bananas go bananas cincinnati ohio and uh that's a negative and uh a very derogatory  statement towards me you're right and uh sorry and i just want the people to know come to the show i 
[00:42:30]  kill you'll never see the same show twice with rich voss and uh never rich is very funny on stage  and on the show i i hate when we say that on stage that's kind of you know well i i don't  care about the story yeah i know but that's all right uh you know you just gotta get the plugs out  it's okay no no i just know who's in cincinnati you know i just figured i throw something i'm not  gonna say what are you gonna do go on wkrp when you're there oh good gravy that's not a real station  oh gravy it is now is it yeah there's just there's some local story i was listening to over the 
[00:43:00]  weekend have we been thrown off of that one too probably if you see mr carlson there can  you ask him how dudley's doing i'd love to give that kid a bath  oh uncle jimmy didn't even try for the voice did you no now it's just now you're just creepy jimmy  but do you remember in uh in different strokes the guy that played mr carlson on wkrp oh yeah  played the creepy guy who tried to give arnold's friend dudley a bath yes that was during the very 
[00:43:30]  special episode where they uh we're trying to bring some uh uh education on uh kids and and  the danger that uh creepy old men oh look at him what's he's he's singing into we're watching it  right now he's singing into spatula and he's putting on a um a vcr to a little videotape for  the kids to watch and i guess it's going to be inappropriate yeah uh probably some type of porno 
[00:44:00]  oh that's funny they're all laughing yeah now look what happens wow the shock oh yeah  it's video of a liver transplant gary coleman is shocked  i gotta see that maybe we should pull some audio from that one yeah let's do that that looks like  it could be funny like that whole scene right there looks uh pretty interesting oh he's like  got his arm around his arm around he likes uh he likes a little interracial uh nambla relationships  there does yeah it's a lot like a dj we know he certainly is hey hey uh yeah well i brought it up 
[00:44:30]  but apparently um we're we're not on in uh in boston hi how you doing hey how about that tidbit of news  uh yeah i guess more cutbacks and uh they cut us back to not being there anymore  so a river dirci uh boston bye bye bcn yeah sorry sorry everybody that uh used to listen to us uh 
[00:45:00]  on bcn and then they're not hearing this unless of course they have uh some type of satellite  but uh wow yeah i don't know who to blame anymore the economy just stinks on ice yes they're cutting  back on everything um but they ran out of people to fire uh as far as the staff goes like uh sales  people and uh uh suits engineers everything else that's kept the uh broadcast companies going 
[00:45:30]  so now they decide let's uh take the afternoon show that's over there in boston toucher and rich put  them in the morning and then get some poor slob that makes nothing put them in afternoons to spin  records and they're saving uh money so that's the day and age we live in as far as radio goes  uh which i don't you know what do i know i'm just on the medium but i think it's a bad idea i think  it's one of these not just because it affects you know me uh i i'd like to still be on bcn of course 
[00:46:00]  but it's one of those things where you uh you keep cutting back on the product and no one's going to  purchase the product anymore and uh if you keep cutting back on the talent and of of the radio  more and more people are going to tune away the reason it's in the crapper now is because people  are going away they're going to other forms of entertainment whether that's you know satellite or  or their ipods iphones phones with mp3 players uh any kind of device that plays video audio 
[00:46:30]  there's a multitude of gadgets that people can get their hands on to program their own uh radio  station the internet uh which used to be silly as far as getting music off of is now one of the top  mediums for getting your music uh from and that's what people are doing and radio seems to think the  answer to that is to just keep cutting back and saving money uh well they're just backing themselves 
[00:47:00]  into a corner um so uh that's that's where we stand as far as uh boston goes they've uh  pulled us off it's not a temporary move as far as we know it's it's permanent and in and uh we're no  longer uh the morning show over there at bcn so uh godspeed toucher and rich have fun yeah those guys  are uh i don't mind you know what are you gonna yell at the guys that got the gig you know no i like 
[00:47:30]  those guys they're they're cool so whatever that's the quick fix man no one looks towards  the future no it's all knee-jerk reactions in in in the business that's how the market goes up and  down crazy it's all knee-jerk crap that people do and uh the radio uh industry is is complete knee-jerk  let's do this we got to do the what are you you got an idea yeah let's do this okay and then they do  it and then six months later they realize it didn't work and they're changing it again  uh so who knows but believe me uh when opie finds out it's gonna be a different different reaction 
[00:48:00]  yeah i'm kind of go with the flow anthony that's what they call me old go with the flow anthony  it's all i don't care pay me anthony uh but um yeah opie will be a little more angry  he's probably listening finding out right now too yeah whoopsie yep uh so um yeah not on there 
[00:48:30]  i was irritated uh when i i walked in completely irritated told me because i love being on in that  market but it's like i don't know i should be more irritated but uh it's like what are we gonna do  it's just kind of expecting it just with the way things are going at at the cbs it's been  it's it's no secret it's been a bloodbath we were just you know celebrating not celebrating just  giving a little goodbye a party to a guy that was here for 41 years and uh they they cut him loose 
[00:49:00]  before pension time it's just we're we're in such a crappy situation and the corporations really  they're not humans they're they're machines they're consortiums of people that make it up so  they don't have uh they're like the terminator they don't have emotions they can't be reasoned  to or bargained with they just will keep chasing you until they blow your head off and they uh i'm  sure they don't like the fact that uh well let's just say the show has been very uh adamant about 
[00:49:30]  certain uh feelings about certain moves i'm sure that they oh yeah yeah i'm sure they don't like that  either their whole thing has been local local uh local local local that's what local means is cheap  that's uh what local means yeah we're into local programming the listeners really seem to like  uh hearing their local traffic and weather and hearing local people that have been to the  ballparks that they uh talk about no they don't they just want to be entertained and they don't care  where it comes from people like letterman and leno prove that by having a national audience if if 
[00:50:00]  it's entertaining it doesn't matter where it comes from the thing is local equals cheap if you're  syndicating a show based out of new york city it's going to cost you more than getting some local  yokel from uh cleveland uh so it's cheaper and that's what they do so they move shows around they  get rid of the show that uh and believe me we were not making a fortune there we we took a pretty big 
[00:50:30]  cuts just to be on uh in some of these terrestrial markets um it's one of those deals where they they  just keep cutting and cutting and then they get rid of the show that's making some money and then  they uh they throw in some guy that's just going to spin records and what's that going to do is that  going to bring the ratings up old-fashioned spin records and talk radio i mean i nobody the only  commodity left is open forums for people to talk talk radio that's that's like a commodity you can't 
[00:51:00]  just download um from somewhere uh like you can music you need a show uh people that can talk carry  on a conversation with other people um trade ideas throw out some controversy that stuff captivates  people not you know a song you've heard 80 times punctuated with a liner and a commercial  but what do i know you know i'm just on the air so screw me yep but none of them get fired i don't 
[00:51:30]  understand well the the corporate end of it is a lot different than the uh you know the lower echelon  which includes the talent the corporate end for some reason there could be 20 redundant jobs uh at the  upper level at the suit level uh they're the last ones to go and they're the ones that that's not the  product for some reason the people that that put out the product and put out a better product and  make the product uh uh more appealing they're the first ones that go and then the people that are the 
[00:52:00]  bean counters and and uh make these these horrid decisions they're the last people to go because  they're not going to say well i'm basically valueless yeah why don't you guys dump me and save 250k a year  exactly they're the people that do the firing they're not going to fire themselves you'd be stupid  to i understand how it works it's like congress they give themselves their own raises themselves  raises huh themselves i said they give themselves they give themselves they give themselves raise  right in the midst of your your passionate moment how many raisins you know that's a great gig 
[00:52:30]  yeah why doesn't somebody say hey you know what let's put out the best product we can  take a little hit right now and build towards your future and that's uh well that seems to be um  an idea that they they just haven't thought of it's all old school ideas it's ideas that  they've been using for years that have worked for years but times changed there is so much information 
[00:53:00]  and and entertainment out there now it used to be you got up and changed your channel on your  television and when you got in your car you turned on your radio uh and that was it it wasn't when  people walked around on the streets they actually maybe talked to each other they hit a pay phone  now there's just people with earbuds in and they're listening to uh they're not listening to commercial  radio they're listening to uh their own programming that they made on their other computers 
[00:53:30]  so it's a it's a weird time that we're in a transitional time that i think radio really has  to uh step up to and and address and do something with they can't use this old school idea of just  making cuts because it's not going to come back it's not strictly economic based the the economy  radio stations suck because uh they they've failed to address this multitude of entertainment that's out 
[00:54:00]  there well and it's like if so many stations are having trouble and it's not like the stations are  doing great and uh this show's not doing well because it's like all right whatever there's  certain markets you don't do well in you get the boot that's life but it's like when you watch every  format change flopping it's like well music doesn't suck it's obviously that people are doing other  things as well so you have to adjust somehow right and they're not adjusting they're just panicking  and go that doesn't work and then going to something else yeah will you relax stop panicking 
[00:54:30]  well if you see some of these moves that they make uh uh the corporate guys just based on panic  and based on trying to save their own jobs it's hysterical uh to watch it's it's not it's not that  far off from shows like the office uh it really isn't that that that's how things are really run which  is kind of frightening do you think it would help if you guys did traffic uh yeah local we got to  keep it local apparently well i mean if you want to do traffic um i don't know what atlantic city 
[00:55:00]  traffic will be like ah in martin luther king weekend january 15th but i'll be down there at the  borgata just in case we're off the air before that i'll throw that one out there what happens when  you're down there and anthony comes up for a loan because i will not be going you could stay in the  kumia suite oh dude that they've built with the money that i i would love to have you there  uh for my weekend celebrating dr king's birthday oh yes i would like to have you there 
[00:55:30]  um i would go for like i play poker and i'd go for a certain flush every time you how could you not  shoot crap wait oh i'd uh okay i'd gamble with you would you yeah i would actually oh yeah just at a  different table yeah not at the high rollers please it'd be a massage table uh once you start  playing craps you'll never play blackjack again i've heard about craps and and i don't know  listen just don't know how to play it learn how to play it you could win so much money it's so 
[00:56:00]  exciting it's that it's the most exciting game ever invented it's what brought me to my knees that  and that and another man and your drug days yeah exactly trying to get a piece of crack what  didn't bring you to your knees i don't mind you spent a lifetime crawling something that looked  delicious flesh colored exactly believe me if the holes in the booth were higher you wouldn't be on  your knees virtually the waist level yeah so um no my my gambling i have to actually uh and it's not 
[00:56:30]  one of these oh my god i gotta uh i hadn't been gambling in a while i went i i took a hit so  now i'm gonna you know curtail it for a while and in a few months i'll go back but you know i'm not  one of those guys that are in casinos every weekend believe me i kind of like uh being able to purchase  things yeah well don't act like you don't have a problem don't act like i'm you know well i only  well i only mug people i spend i spend what i can afford yeah but it's i don't uh i don't have a 
[00:57:00]  problem well how do you it's how you yes spitting on the floor after you lose oh oh oh an anger i have an  anger problem with gambling i don't have an anger problem with other i have traffic i have an anger  problem um but it's not as bad as it used to be i do have a road rage issue but i've calmed that way  down now i just look and yell out a racial epithet to myself and i'm back on track uh gambling yes i do  have an anger problem with gambling uh it's not physical it's purely verbal and um uh i guess spit 
[00:57:30]  is physical but i don't spit on people i spit on the floor i punch the chair um i i've smacked keith  uh in the shoulder very hard and turned around because i want to go look at this crap that just  happened but um you know i guess i gotta calm that down a little bit just hurts to lose a nice big  hand that you were counting the money you were counting the money these are the worst justifications 
[00:58:00]  i've ever heard i spit on the floor and i punch chairs yeah it's not like they're old people  here's your test when jimmy's working atlantic city yeah you go down to spend a lovely weekend  and see if you can go without gambling just hang out for a week no why would i go there without  gamble to see your friend and spend a nice weekend in a nice suite yeah have some nice dinners you know  and go to the show maybe introduce him or something whatever or set a limit like i do i set myself  a two hundred dollar limit on the video poker now watch that they hear me saying this to anthony 
[00:58:30]  they fire me yeah yeah we don't need you sissy look at you chasing off our uh high roller yeah no i i  don't uh i i don't want to go there if i'm not going to gamble it's like what jimmy's going to go to a  certain type of massage parlor and just say just massage me absolutely true see i could get see now  bonnie thinks it's just gambling so i quit but like mega marrying you well that it's already a  loss gamble of course there's no gambling that gamble is maybe it won't suck mega millions is like a 
[00:59:00]  hundred and chip teeth  so i pick the numbers on the mega millions yeah i pick them but i give her the cards and she goes in  and she plays them with her money that's not that's not gambling for me casino gambling no but  i'm saying she thinks i'm still gambling oh oh oh no that is yeah no it is not yes it is how is it  gambling i'm not spending my money and i'm not going i'm just picking numbers that's like saying 
[00:59:30]  if you can tell yourself anything it's like some an alcohol an alcoholic if i pour a drink for somebody  no she's pouring the drink for you holding it and putting it in your mouth no because the end result  is you're the one that will get the payoff if it pays off well then i don't care if it wins then i  don't care if i'm gambling how about this if it's not gambling if you play a card game where you guys  all had a bunch of chips right but they were valueless and you're betting valueless chips that's 
[01:00:00]  still gambling right i don't think so hmm is it not for money chips sure you're just not gambling for  money you're gambling for the thrill because a lot of times because gambling but there is no thrill  without the the loss the potential loss of something sure there is so you're saying there's  no value to the chips then there's no gambling because you're not getting excited about the  prospect of winning or losing you've done a whole you can still get excited about the prospect of  beating people well then or being good at cards you're not beating them out of anything meaningful 
[01:00:30]  so then you can't say you can actually say you can't play monopoly because you're still playing  yes see there you go you know the difference you know what i'm talking about like you you know  you could spell it however you want you know that like if you're so odules is is if you drink  odules you're still an alcoholic there is actually alcohol in it there's a minuscule amount yeah but  there is actually in there and to me anyone who's quote-unquote sober drinking odules is  drinking even really yeah yeah well see that yeah what about a uh shirley temple there's no alcohol  in that at all see but it looks like a drink doesn't matter when you're drinking no you're not 
[01:01:00]  well i mean you're getting the feeling like you're drinking something no you're not there's  no effect from alcohol well then there's no effect when gambling with worthless chips but there is  though like if we were playing that's the alcohol of gambling is the worth of the chips the proof of  the chips nah because if you were playing like for nickels even though that's a minor amount of money  you wouldn't have any real investment in whether you won or lost you'd actually do feel better  playing with nickels than you do playing with nothing for funsies yes yeah but playing for funsies you 
[01:01:30]  still have it's still gambling even though it's not financial wow i can't agree with that no i don't  agree with that because like if i was playing golf against somebody and i they said the next hole i  bet you nothing i win well there's nothing on it yeah but again there's a difference and you know that  jimmy's talking about the gambling dry hump yeah which uh is uh it's not satisfying and maybe it's  you know yeah you're not satisfied you're left chafed and uh in pain all right how about this one  you're dating a girl uh-huh and uh and she just dry hump somebody are you gonna go well you didn't 
[01:02:00]  cheat at all no i'd get excited tell me more i want i want my chips back uh yeah that's a interesting  proposition but i'll stick to gambling for for for money when you know a money i can i actually  disposable income which i really dispose though so i can buy other things like what i purchased i had  a couple of major purchases over the vacation one of which is typical that people will probably 
[01:02:30]  understand uh one of which is something that i don't think uh you guys know about um that i will  break here on the air okay so one is typical and one is one that we'll be surprised at yes all right  let me guess before we go to break uh-huh uh uh a german tank close and an obama button wow you would 
[01:03:00]  be surprised at that no no but um we got to take a break and uh wow what a tease that was i'll let you  know uh after three more breaks no i'll let you know after we take another break we'll be right back  the opian anthony show get

[01:07:00]  really nice car it's a mazda something got a number after it probably the police took it  it was probably using an amber alert they had the hose out the back yeah creepy car i get i get well  the baby i get her stuff but i return it but i videotape her with it so when she gets older i could  go no you had everything that's funny part of my act uh right there with my act oh god i feel like 
[01:07:30]  anyhow but no i get them you know the other day i bought her a little fire truck and a rocker  little horchy rocker and stuff you know did you do anything for a black friday the big shopping day  after um after thanksgiving that's the day everybody goes shopping trample someone apparently yeah  apparently tramples people to death how great is that like when i saw it i'm like oh boy here it is  here it is these greedy stores and a bunch of animals uh lined up there's a story right now 
[01:08:00]  they're doing it on uh it was a walmart uh out on long island not one of the more desirable uh places  on long island i'll tell you that because when they showed the video of uh the people standing out  front they looked uh pretty unruly well they couldn't go back to next day they didn't have like  they thought really triple x was going to sell out in one day they couldn't go get their horrible  clothing for two dollars like that's the biggest no one no one understands why people line up at four 
[01:08:30]  in the morning or earlier to get stuff they can absolutely get uh later in the day when the crowd  dies down you don't have to wait online you don't have to rush the door uh like a lunatic and trample  the employees uh but for some reason they were lined up and there were thousands of people uh lined up  at this walmart uh looking to get deals on like bad flat screen tvs and yeah you know like um all-star 
[01:09:00]  tv it's not even like a sony or panasonic they got some crappy tv it's a sketch tv yeah it's in hb i don't  know what that is but it's very close to hd hey look devil's advocate here uh i think he might  have had it yeah yeah devil's advocate where can i get online for some shoe platform they ran me over  and you can see my little shoe lips and then my wig somebody slipped in my emilio estevez wig and fell down 
[01:09:30]  um he uh was supposed to open the doors at 5 a.m yeah and at 503 oh boy mr tardy walks over well well  and gets his comeuppance and he uh he deserved it i guess is what uh jimmy's saying for being three  minutes late for letting them in for the people by the way after this man is trampled and he's laying 
[01:10:00]  there and other employees are trying to get to him to help him uh the people online were upset  they were upset that they weren't able to get in and shop because they stopped the line so they could  maybe save this guy's life which they tried but uh he he wound up dying but these uh animals um were  still trying to get in and complaining to the people in the store that i i've been here since 4 a.m  i want to get in and shop they ran over a cop they were trampling the cops were they i think so i 
[01:10:30]  don't think they were i think they were no they were i think it was a store employee yeah and uh and  a pregnant woman got trampled a pregnant woman got trampled eight months pregnant yeah well we know  who paid for that that's wonderful well they were trying to uh they didn't want to come out and say  look we know a guy's dead we don't care so they're trying to use like like psychology they're like look  we have to keep the store closed because somebody died and they're like well i mean he's dead that's  terrible but letting us shop i gotta i gotta get it's christmas shopping keeping the store clothes 
[01:11:00]  is not going to bring them back to his loved ones wouldn't he want us to keep shopping i don't think  they would have sounded that logical and reasonable to tell you the truth probably not i think it just  would have been some uh sounds and uh some more violence i think there should have been security  there uh these these these stores love these publicity stunts where they line people up throw  the doors open and have this huge uh influx of of shoppers but what happens is a lot a lot of times 
[01:11:30]  people do get trampled i was watching a bunch of videos last night laughing my ass off you don't  realize how many times this happens where people don't get killed but get really hurt there was one  a woman falls down this big fat woman falls down and her weave falls out of her head and she's  scrambling trying to grab her hair and put it back on her head and get up as she's just being stomped  on i was howling it was so funny how barbaric are people though like because somebody stepped on a 
[01:12:00]  guy's face and then kept running yeah the electronics aisle yeah i need a tv like they're running they're  going oh my god oh my god stomach neck face i gotta get that sweater and they kept going  what's wrong with people yeah yeah well now of course they're uh the authorities are stepping in  they want to legislate against these uh publicity stunt type things that they do where they people 
[01:12:30]  line up and and just run into the stores uh look there it is there is boy it's it's there's the  woman whose hair falls off look look at look at her grabbing her hair puts her hair back oh it was  remove your hair day at walmart i mean some guy helped her up though yeah she is crying in a  wheelchair oops there's a lawsuit sorry i think what was walmart walmart's response to the guy he  should have went to college they um they were uh one thing they do is hire a couple off-duty cops 
[01:13:00]  or have a couple uniformed cops and make the line and let them in x amount of the time that's what you  got to do well i've i've seen other videos too at uh best buys and other stores where they do have  police officers there they line the people up they make sure it's not this crush against the  doors is what happened here is that they were crushing against the doors and broke the the  glass on the doors and then they just started crawling through uh the cracked doors and i guess 
[01:13:30]  this guy was trying to hold him back or something oops the crowd was apparently chanting push the doors  yeah push the doors push the doors yeah push the doors and they were trying to actually open the  doors before they could unlock them yeah that's the new chant as opposed to obama biden uh as opposed  yes we can well yes we can time for change push the doors uh it just is a a despicable act 
[01:14:00]  yep by some despicable people i hope walmart's uh very proud and very happy with uh themselves what  can't you get at walmart that you got to line up and just i know one in like don't sell uh don't sell  albums with certain lyrics or offensive adult content on them at walmart no that might kill somebody  what so what did you buy oh yes my purchase um actually uh i bought a brand new  new firearm of course is that the part that we're shocked that no this would be the part that is 
[01:14:30]  obvious uh i just it's not the one that i talked about uh a mere week or so ago when i bought uh what  is dubbed an assault weapon by uh liberals democrats and obama uh that i bought a couple weeks ago i  finally got a desert eagle there is a picture of it it is a 50 caliber handgun  it should it shoots 50 caliber rounds there is a sheet that comes with it that tells you how not 
[01:15:00]  to shoot it why it's just going to push you back it's that power you don't one hand it it says don't  limp wrist this gun and uh you're not even supposed to absorb the shock like normal with your elbows how  you know in the movies you shoot the gun your elbows bend up uh you're supposed to lock your elbows  and absorb the shock with your shoulders and body uh because this thing will f you up there are some 
[01:15:30]  videos again on youtube and other various sites of people firing this weapon and hurting themselves  uh one is a is this of the young woman that uh gave it a whirl yes here's a skinny little waif  dressed in combat fatigue pants a little uh little bikini top and her loving boyfriend has just  handed her a 50 caliber desert eagle for her to fire and this is the power that this gun has as you 
[01:16:00]  watch her shoot and the gun uh in all its might flings back  and hits her right in the head barrel first by the way she could have blown her head off  uh because the barrel it wasn't the the top of the barrel it was the actual part where the bullet comes  out hit her square in the forehead wow that's why you gotta lock your hands together look it slips out 
[01:16:30]  of one of her hands wow and just smacked her right in the face i'll shoot it with one hand oh yeah you  want to hand that thing yes jimmy they call him one hand jimmy they certainly do uh so now keith got  one too because it was his birthday present from july it took that long for this it's an israeli weapon are  you giving out birthday presents from july well that was what i did yes for keith well keith is my personal  assistant so i got him the same one i got it's a nick uh shiny uh nickel finish desert eagle 50 caliber 
[01:17:00]  it also comes with a barrel for a 357 magnum and a 44 and the 50 cal so now keith is going to go to the  range and then he sends me a text last night he goes what do you think we go after uh your show today  and we start off with the 357 then we go to the 44 then we do the 50 so we don't look stupid at the  range and i was like yeah i was kind of thinking that but now i'm thinking it might look a little 
[01:17:30]  wussy to get in there with the desert eagle and not just blast off the 50 cal and look like men but  the desert eagle is the top notch you're saying the 50 cal is the 50 there's no no i'm saying the  desert eagle there's no reason for it it is probably amongst the most useless weapons on the face of this  planet but you want to have one uh just to have it because it's such a big heavy the thing weighs about 
[01:18:00]  five pounds it's got to be hard to aim right it's very hard to aim because it's so heavy and you're  so concentrating on the the kick that it's going to have that you you you're kind of afraid to shoot  it for the first time uh and it's a very heavy gun so it's hard to hold steady when you're aiming  the muzzle flash that comes out of this thing is is astounding uh it's more a showpiece it's just kind  of these hey i want one i'm gonna get one so i decided me and keith should have these to go down to 
[01:18:30]  the range you just annoy people with the the loudness of 50 caliber rounds even through the  headphones what's a boat what's like one bullet cost for something like that it's um let me see a box  of why are you hungry 20 20 was 50 bucks 20 bullets is 50 they're very expensive bullets you can shoot  that in no time and then keith uh went because i i was able to pick mine up first uh i had all the 
[01:19:00]  paperwork done keith was working so he had to go down there so i i paid for it and everything he  just had to go pick it up so he goes to pick it up and then he texts me he goes they just told me  somebody uh bought up all the 50 caliber ammunition in the store he goes well who was that i said yes it was  me i bought every 50 caliber round that the gun store had how many was that you should see my closet  i don't know but it took a couple of trips 
[01:19:30]  my closet is an armory at this point what's wrong with you nothing i like to be safe  who's coming after you uh uh sosa's people the end of scarface because sosa said so  no you never know if uh zombies you ever see a zombie movie they run out of ammo quick  you gotta hit them in the head i just like having a lot of guns and a lot of ammo before obama decides 
[01:20:00]  we shouldn't have guns and ammo do you have a machine gun like a little i'm not allowed to have  a machine gun people aren't allowed to have machine guns uh you can't have a fully automatic now they  call them automatic weapons obama's looking to ban automatic handguns which is nothing but a  semi-automatic you're still pulling the trigger every time it just automatically you keep racks and  cocks itself yeah as fast as you pull the trigger so he wants those banned i guess he wants everybody to 
[01:20:30]  just have a revolver and a musket uh apparently but in the meantime obama is selling more guns  uh i've talked to people at a few gun stores more guns are being sold since he even announced he was  running than any other situation even post 9-11 people are buying more guns thanks to obama obama can  now uh be proud of the fact that he is selling more guns than anybody else uh for any other reason in  this country jesus yeah so uh the gun stores are packed they're full of what are dubbed assault 
[01:21:00]  weapons which are nothing more than a semi-automatic rifles uh with a few cool looking attachments to  make them look military like they really don't do anything for the performance of the rifle uh but  they're dubbed assault weapons to scare people uh he wants those to be uh gone so he wants everybody  with a bolt action you know uh with no scope on it because once you put a scope on it it becomes  what they dub a sniper rifle yes certain scopes they want to outlaw because it becomes a sniper rifle 
[01:21:30]  which again will scare people uh when you say that um it just it's one of those situations where i felt  you know i'm going to go in and until he's inaugurated and starts cracking down i'm just going to keep  buying guns that's what i'm that's what i'm doing i'm exercising my second amendment right and i am  just uh buying up guns and taking them to the rain uh range and having fun when you buy a moat  when you put a moat around your house uh zoning oh yeah zoning laws i got a pool in the back hopefully 
[01:22:00]  someone will fall in that and i'll be able to pump a few rounds into them well what was the thing that  people would be shocked at oh that wasn't it no no no i bought something else um uh aside from the uh  what are you smiling for do you know no i don't actually oh okay oh we have to take a break damn  it oh here's a uh the um a video of somebody shooting uh we'll pop all these up and of course  of course me and keith are going to take some video of us shooting these down at the range uh later on 
[01:22:30]  today and i'll post those tomorrow i'm taking it with the little flip uh cam which of which i have  two i bought the original one and then i had to get the hd one so i'm taking the original one  and i am putting it on the target and hitting record putting the target out there a few uh  feet and then blasting near the camera near the camera so we'll get a unique view of what it's  like to be on the receiving end of a desert eagle on the video uh so we'll post that one later too 
[01:23:00]  uh let me let me take a quick look at uh that one because this is somebody down at the range firing  the muzzle flash is quite astounding  whoa  how do you aim that it's impossible the guy had to shake his hand because he just hurt his wrist on  shot number two sounds like a cannon it is it is a cannon it's a 
[01:23:30]  that's crazy and he's not hitting the target i don't know what he's hitting this pussy doesn't  know what he's doing i fire with one hand and i can shoot better than anybody will you do the  oldie time cop stance where you have one hand on your hip and the other one straight out with  the gun like i'm a little teapot with a gun and the israeli army uses that i don't know what the  israelis do with this uh they they decided they needed a five pound gun that shoots 50 caliber bullets 
[01:24:00]  the israelis are wacky when you're surrounded by people that hate you all you do is make bigger guns  and then of course you export into the united states where kooks like me yes get to uh collect  them a plastic burr shoots himself with it yes yeah we got to get into that dope we'll get into uh  that great one uh what a dummy plexico what the hell is that without being personal but is something  like that really expensive a gun like that uh it don't come cheap rich i'll tell you that is it more 
[01:24:30]  than 500 bucks perhaps more than that i don't know how much guns go for yes that is a gun that uh  is in the uh thousands range really yeah that's uh not many people have that one a lot of people want  it not many people have it more than a thousand dollars huh fun little gun wow so if i were in  cincinnati this weekend i go bananas would i be able to buy one there yes to hand the audience so they  could all shoot themselves themselves for a second i thought they were gonna shoot boss but then they 
[01:25:00]  still have the memory of his act in their head all right we'll uh we'll take a break and then i'll  get to the thing the other thing i purchased which uh is something that i don't think anybody will will  guess or or expect um but um i think it's a very worthwhile purchase that i'm that your girlfriend  a book bag very funny yes okay um she'll be able to drink soon what did you get that no one will  think that you got yeah try try to try to guess that one jimmy rich okay anyone else hopefully it's 
[01:25:30]  a beginner's pamphlet and alcoholics anonymous first step just a guess all right we'll take a little  break uh of course we'll be right back opian anthony show  welcome back to the opian anthony show my pal anthony is choking on more melon 
[01:26:00]  um it's amazing with all of anthony's lunatic lifestyle and driving 300 miles an hour he's  eventually gonna die on a watermelon seed i'm gonna choke on a watermelon seed  opi is on his honeymoon uh with uh with lindsey they're they're away i think he's back on uh wednesday  and anyone know where they went i mean i wouldn't announce it on the air don't say anything like  that but you know where they went yes beautiful mountain airy lodge ah and the champagne glass  wonderful they actually you know what they were thinking because he's been there they actually 
[01:26:30]  wanted to go to dc they were like we want to go to washington dc but it didn't work out because  i'm there this friday doing the state theater in virginia but that's me yeah they couldn't go  oh okay i got you now boo wow so uh can we please talk about this i i'm so yes irritated yeah  i love when jimmy finds these little tidbits because uh this is annoying well canada disabled  and obese people are allowed a free extra plane seat the to eat is that they bring them would you 
[01:27:00]  like a plane seat or the steak yes a plane seat or a seasoned one um i'll have i'll have a seasoned  one that's been soaked in lard like all my repressed childhood memories um the top court canada's stupid  supreme court refuses airlines appeal of one person one fair uh ruling um because the canada saying that  one person you should pay one fair and i can only like if it's somebody who's really crippled 
[01:27:30]  crippled like people who who like in wheelchair there's a certain like i don't mind them having  to only give one fair to somebody who's genuinely crippled like who's who's injured or hurt or yeah  and even them they just wheel them in they put them in their seat they they check the uh wheelchair or  whatever uh it it's easier with fat people this is just the only fat people have this problem where  they need two seats yeah but you know what you're so upset about this but that's what you voted for 
[01:28:00]  because that's where this country's headed to that kind of behavior and that kind of really really  explain well here's what i'm saying is really so it's obama the liberals are all about well i know  they're more you're complaining about first of all i didn't vote stupid and they're socialist they're  way beyond regular liberal who do you really think do you really think that uh those things wouldn't  happen here if mccain was in office come on man it's silly of course they would of course they would  i don't know i just thought i sound intelligent for a second but i know what you're saying but 
[01:28:30]  it's like a ridiculous comparison look i've trashed the liberals as much as anybody you can't blame  uh obama who has not even gotten into office yet for this oh but it is some kind of socialism  uh that's going on yeah it's a liberal left people call me a liberal sometimes when i say things on the  show which cracks me up it's amazing uh that there was a some of these people there's some uh some 
[01:29:00]  woman in canada had to sue or something she hasn't traveled on air canada in 97 when she endured a  humiliating flight in which the airline refused her an extra seat even though my hips were flowing over  the armrest my hips were basically on the lap of the person who sat beside me so uh because she said  she was born with polycystic ovary syndrome it's always something a hormonal disorder that causes  obesity and about 50 of those affected i would love to see what she eats yeah maybe she is one of the 
[01:29:30]  rare you know what maybe there are people that honestly can say they eat salads and they don't  eat bread and they they become obese i've yet to ever hear of one but maybe you do exist fine well  most people shouldn't travel i thought the embarrassing thing was when they tried to fuel her  yes it was when she was walking and there was a man with two flashlights trying to back her up and  she said i'm a person not a plane how aggravating is when you're sitting there and that person sits  next to you because like i've said to people on planes that i've gone okay you see this right here 
[01:30:00]  there's an invisible wall and they say no there isn't yeah i tell them i don't i don't get i just  like get oh get away from me visible wall i would just uh i've never had the pleasure  of sitting next to uh an obese person on a plane to thank god in raging because i usually have i  travel with somebody and we're why in first class and it's only two seats next to each other it's  wonderful uh but i would constantly be with my elbow uh getting up out of my seat and pinching their fat 
[01:30:30]  between my elbow and the armrest and oh i'm sorry oh excuse me oh i'm sorry because what are they  going to say hey i'm fat stop doing that but i would say you know if they got mad at me i'd be  like well your your fat seems to be on my armrest they should in between uh in armrests they should  have a divider in the armrest which you can raise this way you each get exactly half an armrest if you  want like that's my invisible wall yeah but it should it should be actually something that's 
[01:31:00]  visible and then the fat monster would be stuck in their area it's mind-boggling it's  it'd be funny to see fat just wedged up against this glass big fat thing it would look like the  blob being frozen in the bowling alley and it's like it's like another example people just love to  make excuses for other people's indulgence hey look man i'm an alcoholic so how about this if i relapse  on a plane how about this they they have to allow me to behave however i want because i'm an alcoholic 
[01:31:30]  i'm sick right i'm disabled i can't right once i start drinking i can't stop yeah why do they have  to you know don't serve me down don't serve alcohol in front right no alcohol on a plane or when i drink  because my sickness uh should affect everyone you have to allow my behavior you have to indulge my  behavior that's like you saying don't let a little boy sit next to me i could see you saying that  because of your behavior you know what i mean uh know what i read online or somebody who has  the addiction of a little boy but i know what i read online but pavarati didn't get there in time 
[01:32:00]  do you think this is rude do you think luciano pavarazzi would need two seats  die do you think that's so funny do you think this is rude i was reading online where people think  it's rude that if you recline your seat that people think that's true to get up or they kick your  seat oh the people behind you they could go screw themselves i recline immediately yeah take it up  with the airline i've never had an issue i get out a wrench and i actually uh make it so i could  recline further so i'm in their lap can you give yourself and i have uh the woman's uh breasts on my 
[01:32:30]  face of course it's not bad to recline then they could recline people get upset who gets upset it's  who are these people it's what the seat does it's part of what the plane does they get upset when it  takes off i thought we were driving all the way there boo oh these bunch of dopey fat so and i  know fat people get mad when we beg on fat people look i know some of our listeners are fat some yeah 
[01:33:00]  into our appearances all right with the exception of three all of our listeners are fat but it's like  it's not about being fat it's about when you have something like that look there's times where you got  to take the hit and when the most of society has to sit in a certain type of seat if you can't because  you're too big sorry fly car it's a miracle they're getting your fat ass off the ground  just sit in your seat and shut up so irritating i like when they fly on the smaller planes and they  have to move them around it's like a miss i'm sorry but could you move to the rear of the plane and 
[01:33:30]  then they ask why and it's legitimate they're like well the captain is asked because the plane is not  balanced yes because you're a fat slob and all the luggage weighs less than you we have a sherman tank up  front and we like you in the back to balance it out we're transporting the elephants from ringling  brothers yes and we need you on the other side could you sit on the other side of the plane and  then lead the march through the midtown tunnel  damn slobs but i don't mind cripple people though i don't know like if you got like some kind of 
[01:34:00]  weird you know i really don't mind the cripple yeah i i mean you know i don't like if you got to give  them a break on a plane it's just obese people it's like we just keep making you know this is  canada and america but everything is acceptable it's so it's like nobody just says yeah you suck  we fly with the baby a lot so i'll see i'll sit next to bonnie and i'll go can you shut that baby  i pretend i'm not with him so oh so you don't look like the bad guy and they applaud you yeah hey that 
[01:34:30]  guy yeah shut that baby up actually the baby's good the baby's flown about four or five times and  never been a problem and it's cool because i'm sure the rest of the passengers can't imagine a  girl as attractive as bonnie is with you that's true so that or as young they probably think who's  the chick in the baby with her grandfather  oh poor richie rich um and also uh i gotta be honest i uh i i know this is a very sore subject with 
[01:35:00]  an event but oh no gene simmons has a point  with the watch kiss unhappy about rock and roll hall of fame exclusion  screw them they're a gimmick they're a gimmick band they stole new york dolls act no they didn't  they're a gimmick band why not put the monkeys in there then same thing gimmick band 
[01:35:30]  why what is he upset with just that they're not like i can't put i can't put it on my products  i can't put that uh kiss uh rock and roll hall of fame winners on my products it's keeping food out of  my children's mouths it's keeping wigs off of my head there's he doesn't even care about the food out of  his kids mouth he doesn't care they can just cook it in that and walk he wears on his head 
[01:36:00]  the uh here it is they've sold millions of records they've influenced gene simmons wants to know why  they're not and he's like there are disco bands rap bands yiddish folk song bands uh but not kiss  and uh i believe we have more gold records in america than any other group  uh which they might is it about record sales is that what the rock and roll hall of fame is about  at record sales excuse me uh uh didn't the archies sell a lot of records why aren't the archies in  there because uh uh i think ron bennington said that if you let kiss in you gotta let the archies in 
[01:36:30]  well they let madonna first ballot hall of fame the grandmaster flash they've obviously  i don't agree with a lot of things but because i don't agree with a lot of inductions doesn't mean i  would uh say the kiss belongs in there gimmick paint their face up then i'll stop i want to rock and roll  all night children's band it's a child's band they dress like it on halloween little kids paint  their face up for halloween like this stop it gene oh look gene's on channel five oh wait no that's

[01:41:00]  no not for that reason tonight i'm drinking like a fish damn it i am gonna get hammered tonight  why haven't because i'm allowed to my it was under a certain doctor's orders that i not drink for a  week because it thins the blood and uh because of of what i had done i i didn't need any unnecessary 
[01:41:30]  bleeding that was involved all right wait a minute um you did something yes  that would thin your that you didn't need to bleed from yeah but you're wearing a hat because  your head i don't get it i get it what can i say it uh go ahead say it plugs hair plugs not plugs  plugs no plugs would be me and dc this friday right or atlantic city in january those are plugs 
[01:42:00]  you're talking in ancient vernacular plugs plugs no i did visit the uh uh uh medical hair restoration  i did go and boy what a treat oh you got a thick head of hair no i don't i have a big bald spot in  the back dummy can we say let me say not well wait a minute hold the phone what happened so now i look  like uh a monk with a rash are you having hair restoration done i didn't know you had it done 
[01:42:30]  oh you did of course i you if one more person tells me they didn't never saw the back of my  goddamn head and my hand was always there while you were that's true and that's why i lost the hair  very rough hands i always you always have a hat on i've showered with you in that hat that's exactly  why i always had the hat on and uh it was always just uh uh uh uh when i have to go like i went to  the wedding and i couldn't wear a hat obviously and then if you're standing behind me you're like 
[01:43:00]  whoa because i know i look in the mirror i see when i get a haircut and they give me the two mirrors to  look i see i you know and i lasted quite a while because my father was completely bald like 22 years  old my brother went bald he shaved his head i'm not a shave your head kind of guy unless uh i'm laying in a  hospice yeah i don't have the uh look for a shaved head you look like the machinist yes so uh i decided  to check check it out and uh uh see a lot of people like rich think uh back to the 70s the saying like 
[01:43:30]  hair plugs and this isn't a commercial believe me sales is going to be pissed that i didn't approach  them and and uh do this but i did this all on my own so it's not a plug i paid full price so it's not  plugola it's not hair plugola listen but it's it's what if they take another piece of hair  and plug it in your head i don't care what you call it it's plugs how does it work here's what 
[01:44:00]  plugs were here's what plugs were dummy okay they took a cookie cutter uh uh the size of of a bottle cap  and cut out chunks of the back of your head in big round circles and then stuck them in the front of  your head and it looked like doll hair you'd have a hundred uh things of hair growing out of one big  lumpy scar tissue on your scalp it's a start that is what they used to do what they do now 
[01:44:30]  is you laid it it took 10 hours to do this 10 10 hours wow first thing you do is lay down in a  massage-like table sounds nice yeah your face is down in the massage table kind of a thing cool  then someone trying to pay off a slavery ship debt speaking poor english oh okay this was right on uh  uh uh central park south my friend uh nice reputable uh place and um they uh they cut 
[01:45:00]  from what they call the donor area it is the area back you ever see somebody that's horseshoe bald yes  where they just have the hair over the ears and in the back that hair all that hair is genetically  engineered where it doesn't ever come out doesn't fall out you can't go bald there unless you have a  disease or some crap but the male pattern baldness it's it doesn't affect those hairs  so they cut a big swath out of there and then they stitch it shut and your scalp stretches so it just 
[01:45:30]  it stretches so they numb your head they numb the crap out of your head with novocaine they put  needles in your head needles in my head i heard crunching noises how much of the needles hurt the  first few were kind of painful but then once your head goes numb it's numb you're like voss  i know i know that feeling they call it vossing the patient 
[01:46:00]  so so they uh put a bunch of novocaine in there and uh then they take a you know scalpel and cut this  big swath just about from ear to ear and uh on the back of your your head on that hair that never  falls out okay and then they uh they take it and like i said stitch that shut and then they dissect  the piece that they took out they um cut it into separate here's where it's not plugs separate 
[01:46:30]  follicles individual follicles which each follicle either has one two or three hairs grown out of it  so they separate them all into one twos and threes how long does that take for them to separate a long  time you lay in there and there's three people working under microscopes uh cutting these follicles  out of this patch that they took and getting one twos and threes and putting them together the ones  are you and twos are used for the front for like a hairline so it doesn't look fake and then the  threes are used to fill up bulk area in the back that's pretty much what i needed i did i didn't want 
[01:47:00]  a hairline like you know i'm 25 years old or something like that i you know i want a regular  hairline for someone my age but they filled in a little up front wow a little on the front line  but i needed most in the back because i was watching the um the letterman appearance uh recently and i  walk out and it's the over the shoulder camera and i just go jesus christ gotta do something about  that it's just this glaring white light coming off my head so uh i checked everything out went down 
[01:47:30]  there talked to the consultant he said i'm a good candidate because i have curly hair which blends in  really well and uh and i have like thick uh very full hair that grows fast in the back  and they took that popped it up top and popped some in the front by where the receding was and  stuff like that and uh for the past week i've had a big gangster bandana on my head and this is the  first day i'm wearing the hat which is it's hurting a little it's kind of like hurting the stitches in 
[01:48:00]  the back so they cut when they cut a piece out of the back how do they know like i guess they know  because they've done it but like what if they don't cut enough like what if there's not enough  to fill your head out oh no they they know exactly how much they're cutting out i got about  2500 follicles taken out and put in i said go for the max fill that up how many can they do at a time  uh just short of about three about three thousand no no but i mean like if you had 2500 cut out 
[01:48:30]  do they have to do each one dude individually each one is placed with the grain of your hair too  like the direction if you have a cowlick or your hair grows a certain way they put it in in that  direction so they place each follicle completely individually of anything else the guy goes with  what looks like a hole punch and after they're done novocaine in your head they take this thing  and poke thousands of holes in your head it's just tick tick tick tick tick tick and you hear like 
[01:49:00]  you hear it you don't feel it but you hear like this crunching noise and then uh once they do that  they're wiping it down constantly and spraying it with saline to keep everything wet and then they  take these follicles that are in sitting in saline and then one at a time place them in each part take  a look a few more holes where they figure you might need some more hair then they put it in and they  fashion like a natural looking hairline if that's what you need like i did i really didn't need like 
[01:49:30]  a front hairline uh but some people do they need an entire front hairline done uh i needed just the  back filled up because you know from the the back it was just what's to stop him from falling out  they're just placing him in yeah well for for a week i've had to sit up i had to sleep at a 45 degree  angle with something on my head i've had to put like these gauze on a wet uh saline gauze wrapped in  cellophane and then um uh after five days they take and it's healed but in the meantime if you bend over 
[01:50:00]  or strain yourself you could pop that's why i didn't go to the range with my gun i had a nice new gun  there'd have been follicles up at the roof of the uh above me how hilarious  ten thousand dollars worth of work it just come flying out of your head oh my i've never  wanted to push somebody down step so bad oh i just watch their follicles but you're telling me that 
[01:50:30]  uh showering was a lot of fun too yes showering is just like the first time i had a uh take a shower  you take a gauze pad and put this shampoo on it and then you just like gently tap the top of your  head with the little shampoo thing and then you can't put your head under the shower you have to  fill a little cup up and slowly pour it over your head and and then i started thinking about it what  was going on and why it was stinging and i started getting all queasy and nauseous and i thought i was 
[01:51:00]  going to pass out or throw up and i'm thinking if i puke these things are going to be all on the  top of the toilet seat i'm just going to throw up and they're going to fly out of my head so i just  ran like still completely wet and laid down in bed just going don't puke so i didn't puke but um so  now we got to take a break so dude you're okay so they put these things in your head a week later they  take are they in now okay yeah yeah they're in but how do you know now it's well you might have 
[01:51:30]  you had to have lost some of them right i mean no as far as i know i did this you know the back of  your head it looks so you had 2500 it looks real bad though because they shaved the back where it was  i don't want to look see they they shaved where it was see it's still a place see  see that oh wow it looks like um uh-huh looks like anthony has head aids 
[01:52:00]  yes the top of his head head aids it looks really scabby like yeah it looks like a like someone  skinned his knee yes it's very uh scabby yeah but those come off when you shampoo and stuff but  there's those little bristles of hair that uh you know we're never there so that was gone so that's  going to really grow it that was gone so it grows in yeah in in like six months or something like  that it all grows back and uh then i got the hair on the back of my head i don't have the big friggin  white bald spot so yeah i just figured you know i i got sick of looking at pictures and uh videos and 
[01:52:30]  just ugh hair yeah that's cool hated it so yeah that's the second thing i bought wow okay that cost me  more than the guns was it wow and how painful like i mean after like do you have headaches every day  no it's not headaches you don't get a headache it's not that internal pain it's scalp kind of stinging  kind of a thing pain yeah i'm proud of you there it is you know you don't want to look like you're 
[01:53:00]  wearing a yarmulke no i didn't want a hair hat no comb overs i wasn't shaving it it's my own goddamn hair  hair and it grows and and and and cut it and whatever that's great 10 years from now you had  that big patch of hair on the back of your head no that's been but you know what it is i i it just  i lost hair to a certain point and that was it that was it now your scalp is smaller you have a smaller  scalp they stretched your scalp they stretched it it's bigger well oh no they didn't stretch it that 
[01:53:30]  much it doesn't stretch yeah we got to take a break i'm going crazy over here with the  stunt brain yelling at me uh i'll take a break be right back i'll be an anthony  opian anthony show hi how are you this magnificent monday morning you see rosie's  abomination variety show wow you're talking with your mouth full that adds a whole

[01:55:00]  i did i do have the hiccups i i don't get it and can somebody explain how stupid plaxico burr shot  himself he just turned himself in a little i guess yeah we just saw that uh he was at a club  yeah and uh his gun went off well where did he shoot himself like not location but what part of his  body he in the in the leg but it was just a flesh wound he was going into the club and they started  wanding the guys in his party and he said uh hang on a second i got something so they took him off to 
[01:55:30]  a side area behind a curtain and he took the gun out and was unloading it and uh accidentally  discharged it into his leg wow yeah actually uh well one of the reports i mean there's a 5 000  different reports but the one of them that i had heard was that he actually uh he went to like  unload it or or handle the gun in some fashion and like bobbled it and then went to grab it to  secure it and that's when it finally there you go great i have if you want the audio of the story 
[01:56:00]  sure let's hear how the news uh presented it new details are emerging about just how giants  receiver plaxico burris ended up in a hospital early saturday with a gunshot wound to his thigh  according to the new york times burris was with teammate antonio pierce at a manhattan nightclub called  the latin quarter when burris accidentally shot himself he was treated and released from the hospital  within hours according to the times the bullet pierced skin and muscle tissue but did not hit 
[01:56:30]  any bone or an artery it's unclear how long he'll be sidelined for recovery the accident came just hours  after burris was deemed unfit to play in sunday's game at washington due to a hamstring strain in the  same leg the team released a statement saying obviously our primary concern is for plaxico's health and  well-being new york investigators say the incident took place in a small alcove of the latin quarter  near the vip room it's unclear how the gun went off there were no reports of fights inside the club 
[01:57:00]  it's not known if burris could face punishment by the league police do say felony charges could be  possible is he licensed or no he uh apparently had a florida license that was expired a florida license  gives you um access to about 29 states something something like that new york not being one of them and new  york city certainly not being one of them uh so he uh he was in possession of an illegal weapon in in 
[01:57:30]  new york what will happen to him you think you know they they usually say you're mandatory but for him  that he's not gonna have to do that and he's such a dope too i was they they said that the reason that  he was carrying was because of all his bling that he was wearing his bling so yeah he was afraid to get  robbed so instead of just not wearing it in the first place he wears all of it and takes an illegal  loaded handgun into the club with him like how dumb are you hire a guy with a gun to stand there  yeah yeah but what a dopey thing especially somebody of his you know i mean the guy makes a ton of money 
[01:58:00]  he you know he's got a huge mansion he rolled up to the club i think in like a maybach or whatever  it's just like why would you put everything that you have on the line just so you could wear some of  your crappy jewelry what's wrong with you protect my own bling yep bring my own gag yeah that was a uh  wow and then to to screw up like that and shoot yourself in the leg with it dude it was he fredo yeah 
[01:58:30]  what a dumbbell yeah he could uh he could uh face some felony charges that's uh not new york city uh  they don't fool around really sucks that uh especially if you're a resident such a like pain  in the ass to get one and i'm sure if there was anybody who who would make a good case for getting  a permit for the city it would be him i mean he's a high profile sports star you know he's got lots of  money he's always doing uh where's his uh where does he reside i don't know i think uh i think jersey 
[01:59:00]  yeah see but i'm sure he could i'm sure there's some way you can get some kind of carry permits  maybe i'm not sure of the law unfortunately they just had they just had something in uh news day  about who has uh carry permits in for new york city athletes yeah athletes but a lot of the athletes  only have premises permits they're only allowed to keep them at home for home protection but uh it  seems radio personalities they just do uh imus carry permit sean hannity carry permit uh stern carry 
[01:59:30]  permit so they're all you know they're all allowed to uh to pack heat as they're walking around because  you know controversial have you ever seen talk radio oh of course that's scary i won't root for  anybody you're dead he's walking around he's not attached to the mic he's just walking around ranting  the genius ranting you know i saw that so stupid i saw that movie before and after i did radio

[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you. 
[02:12:30]  Damn.  Well, that's something, Rich.  You got a claim to fame, finally.  I really heard TV.  Okay.  Father hung out with Tom Jones.  And I like the fact that Tom still has no interest in talking to Rich.  No, no.  That makes me really happy.  Like, who cares? 
[02:13:00]  All right.  What's he's doing now, Joel?  What's he's doing now?  What's he doing now?  What's he doing now, Joel?  He works at a travel agency.  You know, he's married again for the third time.  And he lives in New York here.  Oh, good.  You know, real success story there.  Just like Tom.  Is it hard to pretend, I ask Tom, is it hard to pretend like when the older chicks come up to you that, you know, that they still have, that you're interested?  I mean, because you're legendary.  Tom Jones is legendary for just, for women.  That's like your thing is that chicks throw their underwear at you. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Which is a great thing to be known for.  And I guess you've got to be nice to the older ones, but it's got to be kind of irritating.  No, they're good.  They're good people.  The Cougars.  People, you know.  Yeah, but I mean, when it comes to, like, you know, banging them.  Oh, well.  What's the cutoff age?  Do you have a cutoff age where it's like they've got to show you a date if it's over this, you've got to give them a boot?  Yeah, about 30, I would think.  Yeah, yeah, that's probably it, right?  30 still?  Yeah.  Younger than 30?  That's right.  Wow. 
[02:14:00]  30.  He's Tom Jones, for God's sake.  What are you thinking?  I saw, like I said, when I went and saw you in Atlantic City, there were these older women that came up and they're throwing those big old bloomers at you and stuff.  And then these real young girls came up with thongs.  That's right.  And they start throwing those and they're singing and dancing to your songs, the newer songs and, you know, your classic hits that everybody knows.  And I'm just watching this going, this guy has just got it down. 
[02:14:30]  Well, there you go.  You figured out the formula.  A lot of practice.  Yeah, yeah.  You hypnotize these girls.  I mean, what has changed since touring in the older days and touring now for you?  It's the same.  I'm just an older version of what I was then.  And it's my attitude is the same.  Yeah.  And I still like the same music.  You know, I think I've learned more about music.  You know, at one time I like as I was a teenager in the 50s. 
[02:15:00]  So rock and roll was a big thing with me.  50s rock and roll, you know.  And so I didn't really particularly like swing singers.  You know, I didn't like band singers.  That was like before.  But then as time went on, I learned to appreciate Frank Sinatra, for instance.  You know, Tony Bennett and people like that, which in the 50s I thought were like passe.  But you're like an Elvis fan, right?  Like you were a big Elvis guy.  Yeah, yeah.  50s rock, you know, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, of course. 
[02:15:30]  We had a prep sheet.  They always give us a prep sheet, which on you, you know, I mean, most of your stuff is so well known.  But our crack team, this is what they said.  He became friends with his idol, Elvis Presley, in 1965.  Right.  And stayed that way until his death in 1967.  67.  1967.  Yeah.  That's a short friendship.  And, boy, we sure missed out on a lot of Elvis there.  Yeah.  So he was your idol or a guy you really looked up to.  And you met him and hung out with him?  Yeah, yeah.  And my first year in the business, 1965. 
[02:16:00]  When I came over to do some Ed Sullivan shows, and I met Elvis Presley in Hollywood, you know,  I was out there doing an Ed Sullivan show.  Because it's funny, at that time, it went color.  You know, it was black and white before that.  And then when they went to color, they had to do it in Los Angeles, because they didn't  have the facilities in New York to go to color.  Jesus.  Then I went out to L.A. and did some shows out there.  And Elvis Presley was, I went to Paramount Studios to do a song for a movie, and they 
[02:16:30]  said, Elvis is here, and he'd like to say hello, you know.  And I said, wow, Christ.  You know, everything was, like, happening in that first year.  It was mind-boggling.  What was the song that year that was the big song for you?  Well, my first hit was It's Not Unusual.  And then I had Watched a New Pussycat, and then I had a ballad called With These Hands.  So that was in, you know, in 65.  So when I met Elvis, he was walking towards me singing With These Hands.  And I thought, Jesus Christ.  I mean, here comes Elvis Presley.  It was like a dream, you know.  It wasn't real, but it was.  And he said, how the hell do you sing like that? 
[02:17:00]  I said, well, you're partly to blame, you know, listening to you.  Did you ever, like, I mean, with a guy like that, you're hanging out with your idol,  and you're a guy who's known to, like, let's be honest, a lot of chicks.  Did you ever get to, like, we call it pulling a train.  I've done it with him.  Me and him on a girl.  Like, normally what would happen is, because he's better looking, he would get the chicks.  And, like, he would kind of guilt them into banging me as well.  And it would be, like, me and him waving at each other over a girl.  And there had to be some of that with you on the road over all the years. 
[02:17:30]  It was very non-committal.  Like, now you could do grandmother, daughter, and granddaughter.  You could do, like...  Nobody wants the grandmother.  You bang the mother and the daughter.  You ever banged a mother and a daughter together at one point in your career?  I can't tell you that.  That's a yes.  See, for me, ask me that question.  Absolutely not.  I've never done that.  I've never done that.  I can't tell you that is a yes?  That's an absolutely yes.  And that's probably, like, in many different countries.  He's probably banged them in England and here. 
[02:18:00]  What's the most chicks at a time?  We're not only going to ask you about girls.  But, like, Tom, I was so psyched that you're coming in because, again, you're a guy.  You are everything.  Like, you're the pinnacle of a rock star when it comes to that because they're throwing underwear at you.  Yeah.  I don't care about that.  I care about the gigs.  Like, the coolest gig was, like, back then was, like, the Copa and stuff, right?  Yeah.  That was...  Yeah.  That was the place.  In New York.  Yeah.  When I first came over, I did a Dick Clark caravan of stars in the summer of 65, and that sort of turned me off a bit because we've toured everywhere in a bus, you know, all over America. 
[02:18:30]  And I didn't realize America was so big until I did that.  So I went back to England with my tail between my legs a bit, you know, because I thought this is not the way, you know, didn't seem like show business to me.  But then I was playing a place in London called The Talk of the Town, which is a nightclub.  And then my agent saw me and said, you know, you need to be in the Copa and nightclubs like that.  So...  And then my TV show came out, so... 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  What was the big...  Like, I don't understand how back then did somebody just see you and decide, hey, wow, this guy's got a great set of pipes and he's got the sex appeal.  Let's...  Yeah.  At the beginning, yeah.  My manager, well, the guy that became my manager, Gordon Mills, his name was, and he came to Wales, where I come from.  And he was Welsh, he came to visit his mother, and he saw me in a club.  And he said, my God, you know, your voice is incredible.  And I said, well, thank you. 
[02:19:30]  And he said, if you ever come to London and you want some help, you know, I'm your man.  So then he called me up and he said, look, I've never managed anybody before, but I'd seen him on television.  He was a singer himself.  So I knew that he was in the business, you know, so I grabbed all of him with both hands and I thought, you know, you're not getting away from me.  So I could tell that he was the one that was going to do it.  And then he wrote, it's not unusual.  And that was it.  That was the beginning of it.  And you brought up the TV show.  I remember, you know, watching the Tom Jones show, the Variety show. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, yeah, on ABC, yeah.  How did that work for you?  Now, you're a club singer.  Mm-hmm.  You hit, and then they're throwing a TV show at you.  Was that a rough thing for you to go, like, I've never done television.  Well, you know, the only television I had done is guesting on shows.  Right, right.  But now you're...  But never hosting before.  Yeah, you're the guy.  Yeah.  So I didn't know whether I could do it.  So we did a special, first of all.  Because you were in, like, sketches, right?  They'd put you in the comedy sketches. 
[02:20:30]  I remember watching that with my parents, yeah, while they weren't yelling at each other.  Right.  I wasn't crying.  It worked.  And I liked it because I could do all kinds of songs.  You know, it's when you go on TV and you guest, you do one song, maybe two.  Right.  You know, so you've got to...  But then when you've got your own show, you can do all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, you could be in the middle of something to just break into song.  You know, whatever song you wanted.  The duets, you know, I was always pushing for rock singers.  Mm-hmm.  So ABC television wanted more middle-of-the-road people. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  But I was pushing for Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard, you know, which...  And Wilson Pickett, which I got on there.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was like a trade-off.  You know, I had to have Barbara Eden on as well, you know, I Dream of Janie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stuff like that.  Kind of do the little sketches and stuff.  Yeah.  And what a trademark that opening was.  It was the microphone.  Yeah.  And the pinky ring.  And the ring, yeah.  This is Tom Jones.  There you go.  And it's not unusual it would start and then you'd come out.  But you didn't find that difficult to host? 
[02:21:30]  Like, how involved were you in the actual production of that show?  Oh, very much so.  Yeah?  It was, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I was nervous, as I say, when I did the pilot.  You know, but the more I did, the easier it became.  And it became second nature to me then.  It was like a strange time back then because if you did hit in music, apparently they just  gave you television shows.  Yeah.  Like, Glen Campbell had one and...  Well, Andy Williams was one of the time.  Andy Williams was the one, yeah.  Dean Martin, Dean Martin. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, Dean Martin would have that.  Do you find nowadays it is just more difficult to break in and get that popularity?  I think it's basically the same, you know, as it was then.  It's always youth orientated.  You know, record companies are always looking for young bands and young singers.  It always seemed, though, that back then they would give, if somebody clicked, they really  were just handed so much media back then. 
[02:22:30]  They were all over the TV.  They were doing guest spots on Laugh-In and having their own shows.  Right.  Well, the reason I got my show, they told me, was that I could do all kinds of songs, which  was, and I was like 28 years old then.  So I sort of, I filled a gap in there because it was either you got Andy Williams, you know,  singing sort of middle of the road stuff.  Right, right.  And then Glen Campbell country, you know, so they wanted somebody that could cover all  of it, which ended up to be me. 
[02:23:00]  Were you ever censored on television for words or movements?  Yeah, Ed Sullivan's show especially.  Really?  What did they do?  Well, when I first came over in 65, and they said, you know, you can't move like that.  Oh, Jesus.  On television.  We'll cut the close-ups.  He was actually having sex with a girl on stage.  They were telling me something that they'd told Elvis Presley nine years before.  Wow.  Like nothing had really changed.  And I remember I did a, and you had to do it, it was like an, almost like an audition. 
[02:23:30]  Even though, you know, I was signed to do the show, you still had to do a rehearsal  in a rehearsal hall.  Because they wanted to see.  And do it live.  Yeah.  They wanted to hear exactly what you were going to do.  Wow.  And so I did an album track called What You Gonna Do.  And the opening line is, you've been running around balling, which means having a ball,  you know.  Right, right.  You've been running around balling, playing the clubs every night. 
[02:24:00]  And I said, balling.  They said, what?  You can't say balling on television.  I said, well, it's, so I had to say wailing.  Oh, wow.  You should have changed it to fucking.  And then when I had Delilah out, you know, they said, well, we've got to change something  in Delilah.  I said, well, if you're going to take out, I felt a knife in my hand and she laughed no  more.  That's the reason he's killing this girl.  That's the big, yeah, the big payoff there.  But she said, no, it's not that.  It's at break of day when the man drove away, I was waiting. 
[02:24:30]  So they said, it was at break of day, you know, and when the man drove away, that means  he was with her all night.  Oh, my God.  I said, well, yeah, that's why he kills her.  Yeah.  So it wasn't the fact that he's standing with a knife.  Not having breakfast.  Yeah, it was a sex thing.  I mean, it was unbelievable.  Wow.  He was like the most powerful man, though, Ed Sullivan.  Ed Sullivan, yeah.  Was he a nice guy or was he?  He was.  He was a nice guy.  And he liked me, which was very useful because I did like five Ed Sullivan shows, you 
[02:25:00]  know, so.  I heard Ed hated Joe Voss.  Is that true?  Well, he didn't.  Because he never paid a bill.  The skin flint.  Exactly.  He threw a party and he told everybody he was paid for.  Was there still people looking for Tom for some money for that party back in 1968?  Was there anybody that like opened for you that became a big star?  Yeah.  Well, The Who.  The Who opened for you?  Yeah.  They used to open my show in 65. 
[02:25:30]  Jesus Christ.  How do you follow The Who?  Yeah.  Were they hard to go on?  Because Sabbath, Black Sabbath had Van Halen opening for them in like 78 and they said that  it was really hard to go on after Van Halen had done what they did.  Right.  Did you have trouble after The Who or you didn't care?  No, no.  Not really.  Especially there to see Tom.  Well, they used to do these package tours.  You know, you got all kinds of people, a mixture of rock and pop and, you know, so, and everybody  dug it.  So it was fine.  Did you do any of the Motown scene?  Any of that stuff? 
[02:26:00]  Like the tours with the Supremes or any of those people?  Yeah, when I did this Dick Clark Caravan of Stars tour, there was the Shirelles were  on there and a doo-wop group called the Jive Five.  You know, there was a lot of people that were around in those days, you know, so they wanted  to sign me on Motown once.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, you don't find many artists that can talk about their experience with the  Shirelles and Motown that are still putting out albums still relevant, still drawing 
[02:26:30]  crowds, and still have the pipes, and you're willing to take chances that other people  aren't.  When, you know, when you covered Kiss, the Prince song, people were like, what the hell  is he doing?  But it was a big hit.  Yeah.  Well, when I did it with The Art of Noise, I think they thought, oh, Vegas meets techno  pop, you know.  And, but then when they heard it, they realized that it was a, you know, it was a serious 
[02:27:00]  record.  Yeah, because it wasn't, it wasn't kitschy.  A lot of people thought it was going to be this kitschy kind of a goof album.  But, man, you sang your balls off on it.  It sounds fantastic.  And it put you into another category.  You then transcended where you had been and were able to keep your career going, which  you've done for years. 
[02:27:30]  Was that a calculated thing to keep your career going this long?  Did you think when you started that you'd still be in the business and still be as is?  I didn't, I didn't know whether I would still be alive, but with, with, with doing  Kiss, I liked the song and I was doing it in my show live, not thinking about recording  it.  I just thought it would be a good song for the, for the stage.  And then The Art of Noise saw me do it on TV and asked what I recorded with him.  So I said, okay, let's give it a shot.  At the time also was the, really the peak of MTV videos and everything. 
[02:28:00]  So the video really took off and people were just watching.  I remember my, you know, my mother would watch and go, oh my God, it's Tom Jones.  It's like, yes.  So we had the breakthrough video.  Right, right.  You know, so I'd never had an award from MTV before, but.  That was huge.  What do you, what do you, do you do anything for your voice or are you just one of those  guys that just lucky?  Cause some people, their voice goes after a while and you still, man, you, you, you nailed  those notes.  I'm lucky it's, it's, it's a God given, uh, talent, you know, it's, it's a natural voice. 
[02:28:30]  So, um, but I went for lessons when I was a teenager and the, the woman that was, uh,  giving me, uh, voice lessons, she said, you're singing, you're singing pretty, you're singing  really correctly.  If you're going to do pop music, you know, you can't do it any, uh, better than you  are, you know, as far as breathing is concerned and using your diaphragm, you know, in, in,  the, in the right place.  So I think that's what's kept me going.  I've never really abused it. 
[02:29:00]  Singing correctly, right?  Yeah, I think so.  It's so odd to listen to somebody that has such a powerful voice and not think, how are  you not ripping your voice apart on a nightly basis?  But that's just the natural way that you, uh, you sing.  It's, uh, quite fantastic.  Yeah.  I don't have to, I don't have to warm up or anything.  I don't do any exercise.  I'm sure there are singers that want to just belt you in the head after hearing that.  It's like, I don't do anything.  Yeah.  You know, no honey and tea or any of that.  No, he just walks in and he belts out the show, bangs 80 chicks and then leaves. 
[02:29:30]  I do not love that.  I could, I could not believe how great this CD was because I didn't have any of the names  of the songs.  It was just all tracked.  Yep.  But it's like, you know, you've been around for a long time and it's just, it's, it's a  really, like you said, relevant, powerful CD.  It's just fucking great, man.  Thank you.  I mean, uh, you know, I don't know what else to say about it.  I just love it.  It is too.  Like, it's one of those, uh, you know, you could, you could screw to this music.  It's, uh, you know, a powerful, uh, chicks love it.  Not the opening song you can't, no. 
[02:30:00]  Cause every time he goes, I'm alive, you're like looking around like, you can't, but there's  slower songs and then there's fan.  It's like, it's, I wish I could, I could do it more justice and describe it better.  Cause I listened to the whole thing a few times through working out.  It was great.  Do you still, uh, you still enjoy doing the classic, your, your hits, uh, for the people  because they, man, do they eat that up?  Yeah.  Well, that's the, the people keep them alive, you know, when you, when I do Delilah, for  instance, you know, it's so recognizable as soon as it starts that you get applause up  front, you know, before, uh, before you even start it. 
[02:30:30]  So it's a, it's a great feeling.  I like that because if I went to see somebody and he or she didn't do any of those songs,  songs and I thought, well, what's, there are people that do that with that, you know,  the fans are left going, you know, Hey, I'll, I'll get the new album.  I'll learn to love these songs and see them next time around.  But you know something, play some hits.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I do in a live show.  All new stuff that I put in and, and I sort of fit the hits throughout, throughout the  show.  Not like new stuff and then old stuff. 
[02:31:00]  It, and it works.  They all, they all, they all work.  Yeah.  I'm being played by the band, you know, the same, same band is playing it all.  So you don't get that, uh, shock from listening to one record and then jumping to, to another.  Right.  Right.  Playing it all.  Do you have a favorite song?  I mean, I know it's a, it's a kind of a hokey question, but do you have one that like that  you, that you do that you're like, like, this is the best thing I've ever written?  Uh, it's one of the, um, is a song called, it looks like I'm never going to fall in love  again.  It's a ballad that, uh, a guy called Lonnie Donegan wrote for me in, uh, in England. 
[02:31:30]  And then that, that's still stands up.  It's a, you know, it's a powerful ballad.  And you do that every live show?  Yeah.  But it's not unusual is, is the most important because that was the one that changed my life.  You know, your first hit record is, is, is so important and it still stands.  Oh man.  Yeah.  It's a great arrangement to it.  A lot of your songs, you hear the, the classic Tom Jones songs on the radio and you just,  you, you kind of stick with it, you know, you, you don't, you know, I'll listen to  that.  How do you not listen to like, she's a lady or sex bomb and just go, that's a bad motherfucker. 
[02:32:00]  How do you not, you can't not listen to those songs.  They're just great.  When, uh, yeah, when I, I saw you live, I could not, I was in the casino just sex bomb,  sex bomb, the whole, for hours just singing that.  If that isn't one that gets stuck in your head.  Yeah.  It's funny cause kids like that song as well.  Yeah.  It's great.  I don't think they know what the, what it, you know, what the words are cause there's  some, there's some risque lines in there.  But, um, that is odd because, uh, I did see, uh, during when I, I saw your show, uh, there 
[02:32:30]  was a girl had to be eight years old standing up kind of, uh, on a table with, uh, parents  just watching and I'm going, there's an eight year old watching Tom Jones and there's some  risque lyrics going on there.  But I don't think they hear those.  No, no.  They just like the music.  It's the hook.  It's the, it's the.  I like the music.  She didn't throw her underwear, did she?  Like, uh, no, she didn't throw her underwear.  Although she was looking at Tom's pants at one point. 
[02:33:00]  You ever, you ever, uh, done TV and had people go, uh, you know, could you wear some padded  underwear or something?  Well, no, when I, when I had my TV show, I had to wear a belt, like a dancer's belt.  Really?  A dancer's belt, yeah.  Yeah.  Keep it all, you know.  Keep it all in place.  You know why?  Because there is, there is an instance where you'll see him on a live show and go, wow,  that is Tom Jones.  What a great problem to have.  Sir, your penis is going to offend millions of people. 
[02:33:30]  No, I just assumed he had a spare microphone if, uh, the one went out, he was able to just  reach in and get another.  Let's say Burt, uh, Burt, uh, Robin from Batman had the same problem.  Uh, Burt Ward.  Does not have that problem.  My friend, my friend, Jim Florentine's a comedian and he had such the opposite problem that his  first TV appearance, he actually put a sock in the front of his pants and his penis looked  bigger.  No, he did.  Yes, he did.  There was a rumor for years that, uh, that you had done that.  Yeah.  There was the sock rumor.  That's right.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  What I've, I've said is those pants were so tight, there was no room for anything else.  No room for a sock.  It was all Tom Jones.  There you go.  And you probably didn't realize, of course, that the, the tight pants would accentuate  or you never would have worn them.  Exactly right.  It was just a fashion statement.  Of course there was.  Dude, how did it, how, how, how great is it to go through life?  Like you wear pants that show off your hog and chicks go, oh my God.  And they throw hotel keys at you.  Like, what is that?  Is there any better feeling than that?  No.  No.  Of course not. 
[02:34:30]  Did you ever take a hotel key off the stage and not know who you were going to see and  just do it?  No, I've never done that.  You had, what would you have?  Like the roadies and stuff?  Like, you know, kind of tell you who was who and what was what?  Exactly.  Yeah.  So comics, like most good comics have small units because they're covering up their small unit  with comedy or whatever, it's just being like, all the comics that have big units aren't  that good.  Richard Pryor had a big dick.  Did he really?  Yes.  Okay, so one guy.  Leave it to Voss.  Because it was legendary. 
[02:35:00]  We're just joking with Tom about his penis.  You're going into like a real psychological profile.  Yeah.  A lot of people have small penises and our fathers gambled with Tom Jones, thank God.  Creep.  So the new album, what was the, what the hell am I trying to say here?  Oh, you have people write your music or you were?  Yeah.  Well, when I signed with the S-Curve is the label that I'm with here.  And so they were getting me songs, you know, that had already been recorded or, and I said, 
[02:35:30]  I want some new stuff.  And then they started getting me new songs, which I was not excited about.  So I thought, well, I better get in with the songwriters and work with them, you know,  and tell them what I want.  Oh, okay.  Rather than wait until songs show up, you know.  So that's what I did.  Each writer that came in, I worked with them, you know, and told them.  I guess after a time, you figure out which songs are best suited for you.  Yeah.  Because it must be hard to have somebody else write a song for you and then look at it 
[02:36:00]  and go, well, nine times out of ten, it'll be something to do with sex.  You know what I mean?  Of course.  You know, which is fine if it's a cool song.  Like Sex Bomb is a very clever song.  Right.  You know, so that's fine.  But you don't come up with many of those.  You know, the other ones are sort of just blatant, you know, and not clever.  So that stuff, like one songwriter wrote, you look good with my T-shirt on, 
[02:36:30]  you look even better with it off.  And I said, I think that's, you know, we need to move.  Yeah, the sexuality in the Tom Jones songs has been very subtle.  Yeah, yeah.  Like that.  I guess you leave the literal to the hotel room.  Well, you know.  You know, whatever.  So that's what I did.  I got with them and sort of started to write with them and change things around.  You know, so that's, and thank God it turned out well.  I mean, we had a load of, I recorded a lot of songs. 
[02:37:00]  And then we picked what we feel is the best out of the bunch, you know, to put on the CD.  How many dates do you tour a year?  I mean, you're always out.  Yeah, about 200, 200 shows, give or take.  Jesus.  Do you get a regular gig in Vegas?  Yeah.  Where are you in Vegas?  MGM.  Oh, okay.  I saw you at the Riviera years ago, didn't you?  I saw you upstairs at the Riviera.  Not the Riviera.  Caesars Palace.  I was at the Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Bally's I was in for a while. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, maybe it was Bally.  It was Bally's.  Bally's, yeah.  Bally's, yeah.  I was working catch on us.  Have you noticed how Vegas has changed a lot over the years?  Like years ago, it was all like the wise guys that ran it and took care of everybody.  And now it's just a bunch of corporate people.  Yeah.  Who just don't seem to take care of the town as well.  It's easier now because they only want you to do one show a night.  But when I was there in the 60s, you know, in the 70s, I used to do two shows a night,  every night for a month.  Oh, right.  And after a while, you know, you start to get.  Wow.  That was, my voice was suffering a bit from that. 
[02:38:00]  A little taxing on your voice.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially in Vegas.  It's dry there, you know.  And Tom, maybe a few of your friends.  Yeah.  You could get a few of your friends to sing at a club.  Yeah, right.  So, yeah.  But they were there, though.  I think we would work well together if I opened for you.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm saying.  He'd rather have Joe work with him again.  Yeah.  Listen, man.  I'm a top-notch comic.  There's no audience.  I can't work.  Clean Vegas.  I'm telling you.  I think we'd be good.  You know, maybe your opening act gets sick or whatever and you need a rich boss. 
[02:38:30]  I mean, I'm just looking out for the team.  Make the audience sick.  Yeah.  Or maybe the bulge in his pants isn't available, so he needs a replacement, which I'm sure you'd  be perfect as.  He doesn't need a comic open.  You don't use comics as openers, do you?  Not anymore.  No, I do the 90 minutes myself, though.  Did you use comics as openers?  I used to, yeah.  Did any of them bomb?  No, they were all pretty good.  George Wallace was with me for quite a while.  Oh, okay.  Jay Leno.  Jay Leno used to open for me.  Jesus Christ.  The Who and Jay Leno.  That's not bad on the credentials list. 
[02:39:00]  Got a few.  I saw George Wallace a couple weeks ago.  He's still in Vegas.  He's at the Pink Flamingo.  At the Flamingo, yeah.  So you're going out.  When are you going out to promote this?  Well, I'm...  I mean, like, tour dates.  Like, you're out right now doing the press.  I mean, when are you going to have concert dates and stuff?  Uh, yeah, I will do next year now, because I'll be promoting all the way up to Christmas.  All over.  You know, I've got to go to Europe next week.  Yeah, he, like, has to do press all over the world.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  You're recognizable everywhere.  Yeah.  I mean, that's something. 
[02:39:30]  You could go to Japan, and they're like, oh, Tom Jones.  Yeah.  When I do a gig, I fly in the day of.  There's always tickets available.  So I go on the local radio, and I tap dance and beg, and then hopefully people show up.  It's got to be nice to go to Europe, and then go to Africa, wherever it is you go.  Yeah.  I probably could have picked a better second country than Africa after Europe for Tom Jones'  audience, but I'm a non-improving idiot.  The Kenya Dust Bowl.  Yeah, I know.  I really am.  So how is this Sierra Leone?  Are the pirate hijackings going to affect you in Somalia? 
[02:40:00]  I'm a true asshole, Tom.  My apologies.  Anybody you'd like to collaborate with that you haven't yet, that you'd love to do something  with?  Yeah.  There's singers.  I mean, Whitney Houston, I think.  I don't know what she's singing right now, but she's got a great voice.  So I think a duet with her would be nice.  Alicia Keys, I like.  Oh, she's great.  Duffy is the worst singer.  I've seen Duffy in the Starbucks.  Like, they have her.  It's her, right?  Or is it he?  Yes, go.  Okay, I've seen her CDs in Starbucks. 
[02:40:30]  The CDs.  Not working in Starbucks.  That would be atrocious.  A worse future than Joe Voss.  Get over your fault, I mean.  You remember Joe Voss.  Like, Joe Voss had been outside five minutes ago, waving, yelling, Tom, it's me, Joe Voss.  So either Joe, Tom's memory is obviously really good.  Do you remember my name?  Yeah.  God damn it, he has no idea who I am.  It's just me.  Yes, I do.  I've seen it on television, doing stand-up.  Have you ever seen it?  Holy sh... 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  Tom and I are chatting.  I hate this.  Well, that makes me...  Can two men of similar ilk discuss something?  Yeah, where are you going to find one?  Have you really?  Yes, really.  That makes me very happy.  Yeah, yeah, very funny.  A guy like Tom Jones had to get up and turn the channel because of me.  It's funny, he was banging one time and something just wrecked the vibe.  Oh, it's that little man with the awful head shape.  Wow, I'm so happy.  Oh, damn.  Well, I'm a true fan, man.  I'm really happy you came in and you're going to be promoting. 
[02:41:30]  And again, I've been harping about this album.  I really have been raving about this album for the last week.  Two weeks ago because we were off last week.  I don't know what to expect.  Yeah, I think we should absolutely have Tom pick a track.  We'll go to break playing it.  Okay.  Yeah, and man, you don't need my help, continued success.  Thank you.  You've been amazing over the years.  And it's amazing because I do remember as a kid watching and seeing my parents just 
[02:42:00]  freaking out about it.  And then, you know, going to see you live myself and just loving it.  Thank you.  It's transcending generations, my man.  Thanks.  What song would you pick?  Um, Give a Little Love is a good song, isn't it?  You wouldn't pick I'm Alive?  I'm Alive.  I open my show with that now.  I think we have to keep...  Okay, here's where we have to do that.  Oh, we're doing Jimmy's pick then.  No, no.  We're doing...  Here's the way it works.  Yeah.  We're doing Tom's pick.  Uh-huh.  Right after Jimmy's pick, which is I'm Alive and then what Tom wants. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  It's up to you.  It's not up to me.  I'm not trying to override Tom.  You think I run this ship?  That's fine.  The album is called 24 Hours.  And it is...  What's the matter?  We'll be fine.  Oh, we...  I'm Alive and then what Tom wants.  I'm Alive and then we'll play what Tom wants.  What was the one you wanted, Tom?  Give a Little Love.  Okay, so I'm Alive and Give a Little Love.  We'll play both.  Okay.  All right.  Great Tom Jones.  We'll be back.  Tom, thank you so much.  My pleasure.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:43:00]  I'm Alive and I'm sitting here yelling and do my thing. 
[02:43:30]  I'm Alive and I'm Alive and I believe I can breathe and touch and see and feel I'm alive.  I'm a man.  I don't care if I'm right or wrong.  I'm Alive and I'm doing my thing and singing my song. 
[02:44:00]  I'm Alive and I'm real and I can breathe and touch and see and feel I'm alive.  I'm a man who don't care if this has too long of a man. 
[02:44:30]  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah, yeah.  I'm Alive and I'm seeing things mighty clear the day I'm alive. 
[02:45:00]  I'm alive  And I'm sitting here yelling and doing my thing, I'm alive  And I'm real  I can breathe and touch and see and feel alive  I'm a man  And I don't care if I'm right or wrong, I'm a man  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Hope you're in Anthony, uh, program. 
[02:46:30]  Hi.  Hope he's away.  He's on his honeymoon.  He got married.  He went, he went and got married after, after sitting in front of me for all these years,  listening to me rant and raving.  And he actually, uh, went and done it. 
[02:47:00]  Just goes to show you what that, uh, that love stuff does to you, huh?  You get that love stuff on you, doesn't come off.  You just sit there and go, I'm in, uh, that, uh, love.  I'm in that, what you call love.  And then you get married.  I mean, I definitely, you know, wishing the best and everything.  And of course they do seem like that, the happy couple.  And, uh, you know, that Lindsay's quite the catch.  Yeah.  Uh, but you know, it's like the marriage.  It's just, I hope it doesn't, you know, I hope it's not one of those things that change things. 
[02:47:30]  You noticed a change, uh, from the time you went out with Bonnie and getting married to Bonnie.  Oh, of course.  Even before the kid.  Oh yeah, there's definitely a change.  I mean, you know, sex was so wild before it.  It was like, it was, you know, when you're fucking a girl, you're trying to impress her.  You know, that kind of fucking.  Yeah, that's, that's the impressing and not just the getting off fucking.  Just the fucking, even, it's my time of month. 
[02:48:00]  I don't care.  You know, I mean, just every time, you know, just fucking like it's crazy and, you know.  Still eating everything.  Just crazy.  And to, to like, now laying in bed going, are we gonna, you know.  Oh, fuck.  How long have you been married?  Three years, but actually we had good sex the other night.  She walked down to the kitchen and I banged her over the counter from behind.  It's great.  I love doing it from behind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can pretend she's a man.  Yeah, well, Matt. 
[02:48:30]  Well.  But no, I guess it changes.  And then also, then after the baby, forget it.  You know, I mean.  Yeah, it's all about the baby and.  And it's just, it's just a whole nother form of pressure and financial pressure and.  And that affects the sex?  Like your sex life?  Everything does.  Really?  Yeah, I think on Oprah last week they were talking about.  Look, it affects you watching fucking television if you're watching Oprah.  I didn't, by accident.  I was walking by.  Oh, you're walking by. 
[02:49:00]  But there was a sex therapist on saying people really have to marry in case they have to schedule  it.  You know, it's not like, just like, it's hard to just, you know, get ready to, I remember  when the baby was born and I even did this on stage.  I was trying to fuck with a porno win and all this shit.  And the whole time I was trying to get my limp dick in her dry pussy.  I was shaking the bassinet.  No fucking way.  I'm not fucking lying.  Because when the baby's first born, the baby sleeps in your room in the bassinet next to 
[02:49:30]  you.  Does it?  So, you know, just, okay, the baby fell asleep.  We can fuck.  But then you're trying in all the noise.  The baby starts crying.  And you're shaking the bassinet to try to calm the baby down as you're trying to fuck it.  Just fuck in the bassinet so it shakes at the same time.  That's a whole nother fantasy.  But I mean, you know, we're cool.  You know, it's just, it's life.  You know.  No, it just seems like I'm, I'm too fucking selfish for, for that, for that kind of thing. 
[02:50:00]  And that's not life.  Life is fucking, life is fucking enjoying yourself.  When you die, you die in your own arms, Anthony.  Listen, I remember when I was in here.  Fucking Tony Soprano's mother said.  When I was in here.  And it's true.  So just have fucking, have, have fun.  No.  Why, why now is it that you're not really enjoying as much as you used to sex with the  person that you've now decided that you're going to spend the rest of your fucking life  with?  But you're wrong.  See, I remember when I was in studio here once, that asshole, the fucking wrestler with 
[02:50:30]  the soda pop, whatever, that fucking guy that sold 2,000 seats that said he was selling  everything out.  Go fuck yourself.  JBL, he was fine.  Oh, fuck him.  He said, you know, anybody can have a kid or, you know, cause I said, enjoyment in life.  I go, well, I have kids and that's a, and he said, oh, anybody can have a kid.  You're right.  Anybody can have a kid, but taking on a responsibility, having a kid is a whole nother thing.  And you're right.  Uh, dissection might not be as good, but when I get to, for me, for me, when I'm sitting  in my daughter's basketball game and watching her score, or I see my kid get an honor roll, 
[02:51:00]  you know, that kind of shit, you know, all the fun you have in life.  Is that good?  That's fun.  Yeah, I'm sure it's nice.  I don't know.  It is.  But it's not up there with blowing a load on someone.  Fuck no.  It couldn't be.  No, cause you know what?  I've blown so many fucking loads in my life.  Okay.  It just, for me, I don't know.  Everybody doesn't think that you don't have kids, but if you had a kid, maybe.  No, I know it does.  They change everything.  Cause my, I seen my brother and stuff now is, you know, he's fucking gone. 
[02:51:30]  Look at this world.  You can't keep what you have unless you give it away.  And that's a known fact.  Wait, can Steve come in here, please?  You don't understand that.  Do you?  No, I didn't understand that.  You can't keep it, give it away.  What?  What are you doing?  It's like, it's a recovery statement saying you can't keep what you have unless you give  it to somebody else.  If you, unless you, so in life.  I don't know what he's talking about.  In life, whatever you have, if you don't leave anything behind to anybody, then what  the fuck is the meaning?  Oh, the meaning was that you had a great time while you were here in, uh, when the blackness 
[02:52:00]  of death comes, that is nothingness.  It won't fucking matter anyway.  Right.  Okay.  So you don't want anything to carry out the legacy of Anthony?  What legacy?  What?  I'm so fucking important.  I need a legacy.  I'm having a good time while I'm here and I'm leaving nothing.  All right.  So that's fucking scorched earth policy.  That's my fucking life plan.  Scorched fucking earth.  Scorched.  But how do you know not having kids wouldn't be a better time?  You don't know that.  I don't know.  I could be laying there on my deathbed going, I wish I, my only regret is I didn't have fucking 
[02:52:30]  kids.  No, I'm not saying, but it could be a better time.  What, what would be better?  Um, doing everything I want to do, only worrying about myself for the most part, or having this  pressure of now you have this fucking thing that you have to worry about forever.  You're worried about, you're always constantly fucking, you know, thinking about, uh, gigs  and fucking cash. 
[02:53:00]  Well, because I, you're right.  Because I don't have the financial status you have.  If I, no, no, I mean, even if I had a kid, I don't care what my financial status is.  I'd still be freaking out.  I don't, I wouldn't be putting a fucking movie theater in my house.  I'll tell you that much.  I wouldn't be putting, I wouldn't have a pool in my backyard.  I wouldn't have all the guns that I have.  I've never had a movie theater in a pool and I, in things I've gotten by.  If you want kids, you have them.  If you don't, you don't.  It's that simple.  Yeah.  But people.  I like not having them.  There's no glory.  There's no valor in having them.  And there's no shame in not having them. 
[02:53:30]  Like whatever is your, whatever is your, as a responsible person.  Jimmy mediated.  But no, no, no.  But I mean, for all of us, like whatever is your personal thing, like your choice, whatever  you want, you do.  Yeah.  To people who love being parents.  And they're good parents.  Me, I don't want to be a parent.  I often wonder that though.  If they honestly love it.  Yeah, I think there's enough to do.  They're always bitching about it.  No, I don't.  You never hear me bitch about my kids.  Ever.  I don't bitch about my kids.  And they fucking.  You bitch about your wife. 
[02:54:00]  Once in a while.  And the kids.  But I'm not even the hacky guy that cares to bitch about his wife.  I'm fucking 51.  So I'm, I've done what, there's nothing left to do.  You know, what am I going to do?  That's a nice outlook.  You know, what the fuck is spent.  There's nothing left to do.  How about succeed?  Shut up and let my friend laugh at you.  That's funny.  That's funny.  All right.  We'll leave that at that.  I have a question for Steve.  Yes, Jimmy.  I want to hear the, you had, Steve asked Tom Jones a question.  And apparently it was stammering. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, no.  It was, I actually would have said it on the air, but I didn't want to interrupt because  I knew we didn't have a, a lot of time with him.  So it was taped.  So I want to know, can we hear it?  No, we can't because I deleted it intentionally.  Why would you do that?  Because I'm in a fucking asshole.  That's why.  No.  Um, cause I'll tell it, I'll tell it right now.  No, no, but why would you?  No, because it would have to be the exchange between you and Tom.  There was no exchange.  Why would you delete?  There was a bunch of O'Reilly's.  But that's just it.  I heard, I heard, that's just it.  The O'Reilly's.  And then I heard there was some stammering involved and a little nervous, like chit chat 
[02:55:00]  thing that can't really be described.  If we, if we heard a story, but why would you?  No, no.  It's not about telling the story.  Because when I see somebody very obviously surreptitiously, uh, going over and clicking  record, record, record, record, record.  I'm like, no, I'm not a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  Maybe if you work at fucking, uh, the nuclear, a nuclear facility, but you're working at  fucking the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:55:30]  It's a comedy show and it's a funny.  I understand that.  I'll tell, I'll tell the story.  No, it's not about telling the story.  It's about having the tape of you stammering in front of Tom Jones.  You're like, why wouldn't you?  Like that would be the good thing.  And there's so much disastrous audio on all of us.  Disastrous.  It really wasn't, you know, honestly, dude, it wasn't.  It was, it was sort of a matter of fact thing.  I don't know.  Sam seemed to think it was pretty good.  Yeah, well, cause Sam's an instigator and whatever Sam thinks he can instigate and stir  shit up on, he will.  But I'll tell you right now, the story, I'll tell the story right now. 
[02:56:00]  But the story is not.  No, it's not.  I know.  The story is me fumbling in, I know.  The story is me fumbling in front of Tom Jones.  It's not the story.  It's the execution of the story at the time.  To teach Sam a lesson, why would you hurt the show?  No, it's not.  It's not the news, Sam.  Sam didn't tape it.  Well, whoever.  Why would you delete that when you knew it was like, I mean, I said it to myself, that'd  be funny on the air.  Yeah.  I don't comprehend that.  Like, there's nothing, unless it was something I said that I shouldn't have said or whatever,  but like anything.  A personal, you know, you blurted out your address.  I don't know.  You know what?  Quite frankly, I don't really know if it's, you know, I, it was, it was such a nothing 
[02:56:30]  thing.  But in retrospect, I was sort of like, maybe I shouldn't have brought that up.  Maybe it wasn't something I should have said.  You know, like, I don't know.  You know, it was like one of those things like, eh, you know, fuck it.  You know, if they want to say it, I'll say it on the air, but I'm not going to.  Why would you delete the audio I'm saying?  Like, do you know how much audio I've deleted over the past 10 years that was just like,  you know?  No, but you did that purposely, like.  Would have been the best stuff ever.  Nah.  You know, please.  I get called a faggot and incompetent on a, on a regular basis, you know, so.  Then you come here. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  This is, but this is a legitimate question.  Yeah, I understand it's a legitimate question.  Yes, he recorded it.  Yes, I deleted it.  Intentionally.  Absolutely.  Why wouldn't you think about it would be funny on the radio show?  A five second piece of audio of me getting hit in the face with granny panties and a fucking  Tom Jones show?  No.  No, no.  If it was nothing.  I comprehend exactly what you're saying, okay?  Like, you were thinking, like, I don't want to look bad on the air.  No.  Dude, I look bad on the air every day. 
[02:57:30]  Every day.  I get made out.  But who?  But I'm serious.  I don't know why you would delete that.  I can't.  Well, if you think it was a crime against nature, then I apologize.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm not.  I'm not saying that.  I'm, I'm asking a legit question.  And I'm giving you a legitimate answer.  You're not, though.  I thought it was stupid.  I thought it was stupid audio.  It didn't sound, it sounded like dumb.  If it's you stammering in front of Tom Jones, then it's funny.  It would have been funny.  Yeah, it's funny.  Like me stammering horribly.  Should I have deleted the, uh, Zach Wilde interview because it was stammering?  You know, honestly, in retrospect, I never thought that Zach Wilde thing was going 
[02:58:00]  to be as fucking funny as it was.  Exactly.  So why would you delete when you know what we do?  Honestly, because it was such an obvious attempt.  If I didn't catch him out of the corner of my eye going record, record, record, I would  have fucking let it go.  I've been, I've been caught so many times barking dumb shit into microphones that I've just  let go completely.  So it was to keep somebody else from having pulled one over on you.  Yeah.  So that was more important than audio for the show.  But the audio for the show is like, you know, that seems to be paramount here. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, I understand.  I understand.  And I understand, Jim.  You know, and if it was a horrible, horrible offense that I've committed, then I apologize.  Like, even if it did suck, let's say we played it and it sucked, then we would jump  on the person that said, this is great audio, then that we'd have played it and gone like,  oh, dude, this is nothing.  What are you just trying to get on Steve?  You know, you're fucking being an asshole.  Like, it would have worked if what you said is true, you know.  I've been called queer, incompetent, and a number of things every day. 
[02:59:00]  Can I get a break once?  You know?  I'm not even not giving you a break.  I'm asking you.  Yeah.  And I'm fessing up.  I completely deleted it on my own.  Is it completely deleted?  It's gone.  Because I know how to get rid of things completely.  Oh.  The Tom Jones liners are in there.  Those are safe.  Well, that isn't really, you know.  You know?  But, you know, me talking to Tom Jones is not.  I don't get it, man.  I just thought that would have been fun. 
[02:59:30]  I know the pain of being tormented, and I'm going to have to try to turn my character  around, too.  Yep.  This is one they didn't get.  You know what?  Dude, it's not about them getting it.  It's about the show.  I understand, Jim.  It's not about Danny or Iraq or whoever it was.  It's not about one guy one-upping the other guy.  Or whoever it was.  It's not.  And after 10 years, I don't get that?  I get it. 
[03:00:00]  I get it.  Why?  Considering every chance that is possibly given, I get, you know, fucking humiliated and,  you know, fucking browbeaten.  As do a lot of people.  I caught one.  Fuck him.  No.  You don't get this chance.  Well, it's not fuck them.  It's fuck us.  No, it's not fuck you.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not, Jim.  It was a five-second piece of audio.  It is, though.  It's like, in the sense that I've brought in every humiliating, awful piece of audio. 
[03:00:30]  I've never asked for a piece of audio to be left.  I've never asked to be exempt from fucking things, with the exception of this one time.  How many fucking times have humiliated pieces of audio?  Well, you just said you've deleted tons of audio over the years.  Yeah, but I mean, of myself, making a jackass of myself.  That's what I'm talking about.  No, no, no, no, no.  You're not hearing me.  Like, me in the studio going, eh, that was dumb, eh, that was dumb.  But if I'm in the studio with Derek, and I'm stammering into a microphone, he keeps it,  and he fucking either gives it to you, or he doesn't give it to you. 
[03:01:00]  It happens all the time.  Steve.  Oh, you rock it.  It was very obvious we were recording.  We were not trying to hide it from you.  It was also not done in a malicious way.  It was a very honest moment that you were having with him, where you were explaining a story,  whether he was interested or not, Steve was really just a little set off by talking to Tom Jones  and sharing this experience.  Yeah, that's what it was.  That's all it was.  It wasn't to, hey, Steve's an asshole, let's smash him by using this audio. 
[03:01:30]  Maybe hidden under that.  But if it's gotten to a point where...  It was a very honest moment.  Steve makes it sound like whatever story, like whatever the audio was, be it good or bad,  we were somehow going to call him queer and incompetent because of the story.  It's like, it's not a bad thing, because you keep bringing it up.  And it seems to me like you're the only one that brings it up half the time.  And it was just a goofy piece of audio.  It would have got played, and if it got nothing, it got nothing.  But sometimes stuff just works.  This show, of all shows, I mean, anybody should know,  the weird shit that we decide to pick up and run... 
[03:02:00]  Well, we, like I'm fucking...  That this show runs with, it's, you know, it's anything.  I'm sure it'll happen again.  I'm sure there will be another piece of audio.  It's not about the audio.  It's not like, oh, you missed the audio.  It's about like, something's going on where the first instinct when something ridiculous happens is,  they're not going to get me.  Just to erase it, yeah.  And like, let's get rid of that, instead of, which the theme of this show is supposed to be...  Everybody, every man for himself, everybody smash each other in the nuts.  Not even about that.  It's about, we have a fucking audience to entertain. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, I know you know this, but I'm saying that...  I'm aware of that.  And half of that shit, that's the entertaining stuff, is our disastrous...  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's what...  Funniest stuff is when we're fucking up.  Yeah.  And it's gotten to a point behind the scenes where that's something that, like, your first instinct isn't like,  oh, that'll be...  I'm an ass, that'll be funny.  Like, you know, I get why that would be funny.  Like, when I hear me and Zach Wilde, I'm a blithering idiot.  What about the dress or the dress?  Something about the dress? 
[03:03:00]  I mean, I immediately know that's an awful piece of interview audio.  Who's Zach Wilde?  Deuce chill inducing.  What's that?  Who's Zach Wilde?  It's, um...  He's a guitar player.  It's, uh...  I immediately know, like, that's what that's good for.  It's awful.  And, like, instinctively, like, your first instinct is, fuck them, they're not gonna get me.  Yeah, I guess we can't go around with that mindset.  I mean, I'm not even saying it's totally his fault.  Whatever it is, it's gotta...  It's...  Well, yeah, it does have to stop.  Why is my mindset, fuck them, they're not gonna get me this time?  It has to be worked out. 
[03:03:30]  Whatever it is, it has to be worked out.  You're right, absolutely.  It's, like, little...  Not that that's ruining the show, any more than me babbling about it, but...  No, it's...  How about, uh, uh...  Do you understand what I'm saying, though?  Absolutely.  Maybe once a month is Steve Appreciation Day, so...  No, I don't think that needs to be done.  Thank you very much, Rich.  I'm looking out.  I'm trying to be a team player.  I appreciate it, Rich.  Sam is saying yes.  I like that idea.  I...  Listen...  No, hey, how come...  Why...  Why is my...  Why has my attitude changed to, fuck them, they're not gonna get me?  I don't know. 
[03:04:00]  That's not a question for me.  I don't really know.  Hmm.  I don't really know.  But, you know, trying to lead a fucking derelict pack of misfits is not the easiest...  Well, what do you think it needs to be done?  Ask Pappy Boyington.  What?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How do you...  You know, this is not the easiest position to be in.  I'll tell you right now.  I'm not saying it is, but, I mean, for us, as on air, it's at times easy, at times  not easy.  I understand that.  And anything that affects...  And I am not one to fucking...  I am not one to, like, you know, every day sit in my, you know, sit in my little cubby  and fucking, you know, figure out how I'm gonna ruin the goddamn show. 
[03:04:30]  I didn't say you were.  I know, but I don't want that to be the implication.  It's not.  Okay.  It's really not.  It's simply about this...  This one...  Like, sometimes little things happen that are kind of shed light on to the way things  are.  And this is...  Yeah, yeah.  That's one of those things.  Right.  This is one of those little things, like, where instinctively you ran over, get rid of that!  And it's like, dude, that's what we...  Like, that's anything that would be bad.  It would be great on the air.  Yeah, the issue has nothing now to do with the recording or what was recorded or wasn't  recorded.  It's now the reason why you would delete something like that instead of just letting them grab 
[03:05:00]  it and bring it in here and we'll all goof around and say how...  Maybe I'm just far too sensitive.  Maybe I'm just way too sensitive.  Dude, all of our strongest value, all of our strongest asset is what we are on the air.  Like, I mean, in any...  Like, that...  You know what I mean?  As much as we tease E-Rock and stuff like that, like I've always said, and he's irreplaceable  because he's a fucking mess.  And E-Rock, you know, if you're hearing this, I love you.  He's a mess!  But he's always bringing something. 
[03:05:30]  He's a mess!  E-Rock, you know that!  But it's like, that's great to listen to.  Of course.  And Steve was saying how it was just a nothing piece of audio.  Well, it would have worked great.  I mean, let's say it was a nothing piece of audio and Eric was like, oh, because he ran  in here with the big story.  Imagine if there was just nothing there and it fell on his face and we just got to smash  Eric for 20 minutes.  Then Steve wouldn't have gotten a bruise.  It would have been fucking E-Rock that would have just gotten hammered saying, you brought  this in as something good?  My sensitivity level has been fucking raised so goddamn much over the past couple of years. 
[03:06:00]  that I'm always constantly, constantly looking over my shoulder.  And that's not entirely internal paranoia.  I'm not saying you're paranoid.  And you're right.  It's got to be fixed and it's got to be addressed.  I wish I knew.  I wish I had the fucking magic bullet to fix it.  But, you know.  Uh-oh.  Bullets.  Or bullets.  Well, Voss, like, here's the perfect example.  Voss is, I knew he'd be afraid to act with Chaz Palminteri.  And it was like as disastrous as that was for a performer. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, I'm saying this nicely, but, like, he basically.  Louis beans?  Yeah, I mean, you know, you humiliated yourself.  I'm talking so much.  I thought I was saying, but that's.  Hey, hold on a second.  I had to fucking serenade my girlfriend in front of fucking, you know, on national radio.  Dude, no one is saying.  So, I mean, you know, to, yeah.  No one's a bigger believer in Steve audio on the air than I am.  Believe me.  I know you.  I know.  I'm a fan.  I think I pulled through that audition.  I mean, that read pretty well. 
[03:07:00]  Oh.  Terrible.  Really?  Yeah.  But that's what I'm saying.  It's not about the auditors.  No one's saying that you haven't sacrificed your humility.  I mean, of course.  I'm always saying when the instinct is to jump in and get rid of it.  Yeah, that shouldn't be there.  There's something going on that's not good.  I think you're right.  I think you're absolutely right.  I completely agree with you.  The instinct should absolutely be like, all right, they got me on this one.  Like, you should have said, say that, make sure you got that.  Here it comes on the air.  Yeah.  It's going to go on the air.  Oh, I didn't realize.  There you go.  But, dude, that's great. 
[03:07:30]  I'm not cringing at that one.  I know.  I know.  You should be.  It's horrible.  I'm not.  Dude, there's 8,000 of those fucking clips.  But, yeah, you're right.  Maybe I'm entirely too sensitive at this point after being fucking bludgeoned.  Well, you know that's how you executive produce.  Well, what is your response to it?  Like, I ruin things.  There was one.  You know, and I'm really, and I don't give a shit.  You're right.  That's funny.  Play that one.  I think we ought to, you know, think a little bit more about those situations before hitting 
[03:08:00]  the nuclear button that deletes something that might be gold.  Because you want to be liked.  You know what, dude?  I've gotten, I've so gotten past that I understand your point.  Your point is, I want to be liked by everybody.  Yeah.  And the position I'm in, I cannot be.  Right.  Why?  No. 
[03:08:30]  It cannot.  Because you bring this up a lot, and I find this to be fascinating.  You cannot be in a position of authority where you have to administer some kind of-  Steve thinks that no one's allowed to like him or something.  Like, he's got some weird, like, he puts up this huge barrier where you guys, you can't  be friends because he's above you or something like that.  Steve feels like this.  Steve feels like he's up against three people.  He feels like he's up against you, Travis, and Sam, and Iraq to a certain degree, and  that you guys probably don't respect him or like him. 
[03:09:00]  I think you feel like you're not respected.  Yeah.  Completely valid.  And completely valid in a situation where you, on a constant basis, have to subject yourself  to ridicule, and that barrier, or that-  Hold on a second.  Let me finish.  I'm not done talking.  There's, there's, that line between on-air and off-air gets blurred.  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't get blurred, Steve.  It does.  No, it never does.  When have I ever in the office called you gay, queer, incompetent? 
[03:09:30]  How many times have you went-  Seriously.  Everything that you bring up on the air, because you, this is another thing that you bring  up a lot, where you say, you say that the, the shit goes down, uh, you, you, you like  to say that the staff doesn't know when we're not on the air anymore, and it's completely  different.  The, the kind of behavior that goes on on the air is completely different off the air,  but you seem to think that it continues when, in fact, it doesn't.  It doesn't.  No, I'm not saying, I'm not saying-  We'll play, we'll play goofy gags on you, occasionally, we'll, you know, pry off 
[03:10:00]  every key on your keyboard and rearrange them.  Which is now, which is now somebody's responsibility.  Uh, if, uh, yeah.  But it's just goofy stuff.  I know, well, if she would, yeah, but I'd be somebody accountable for that, by the way.  So.  Done?  Here's the difference.  You look at that with rage, we just, like, if somebody did that to my keyboard, if I came  in in the morning and my keyboard was all mixed up, I would just start laughing and start,  it's funny.  I wouldn't know the difference.  Steve doesn't think-  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't tell you-  I thought he was seeing double from the night before.  I actually thought about this. 
[03:10:30]  Um, whereas, this show is comprised of people who, by and large, I think, got picked on  a lot in high school and probably in their formative years got picked on a lot.  And I'm one of them.  Whereas a lot of people had to develop, you know, um, cerebral weaponry, uh, uh, to combat  those things.  I was able to smash people's faces into concrete.  Oh.  Uh, with impunity.  Wow.  Unfortunately, unfortunately, you can't do that once you hit a certain age.  Um, so where's the point of this?  Why not?  The point of that is, uh, I don't have some of those, some of those, uh, uh, I'm not 
[03:11:00]  as adept, probably, uh, I'm not as quick-witted as some of the, uh, some of the other people  are, so-  So you'd rather smash somebody with your-  Absolutely.  So fucking lootly.  Well, I guess that's where we're different, because, you know-  Wait, you used to beat up a kid, like, picked on you, and you used to just fuck them up  in school?  Absolutely.  Just really just-  I used to fucking ram people's faces into fucking radiators and fucking-  Would they stop fucking with you after that?  Yeah.  Grr.  Grr.  But it's like-  Why not?  It has to be-  Get the fuck out, now.  Oh, see?  There was some good acting. 
[03:11:30]  It has to be fun, man.  This-  I'm not shit on you.  I'm for all this.  If this isn't fucking fun, like, I-  If this is-  If this is a fucking unpleasant place to come, then what the fuck are we doing?  It shouldn't be.  No.  But here's the thing.  I can-  Can I play devil's advocate?  And say why-  If you can spell it.  Steve's point is-  I know Steve's point.  If he gets abused, he can't come back-  Steve's point is-  He's not coming back and abusing.  Oh, sorry.  You can abuse-  See, you could take abuse because you give it out.  You have the opportunity to abuse.  He doesn't have the opportunity to come on the air and abuse. 
[03:12:00]  Right?  No, it's a valid point.  What do you mean?  The devil's lullaby.  It's a valid point.  He's not-  He just said it.  He's not verbally-  And let me laugh at my friend's comment.  He's verbally not coming back on the air and getting even with anybody.  So all his rage is physical, which he can't do now.  You can verbally-  Got it.  All right.  So-  So he's explaining-  He's explaining what Steve explained completely.  Yeah.  What Steve is saying is that he's frustrated that he can't punch our faces. 
[03:12:30]  Absolutely.  That's what he's saying.  Absolutely.  Well, he's saying that, you know, like, if you-  Steve, what he's been fucked with, I mean, that was how he dealt with stuff.  And if he feels like, you know, I don't think he's saying it that literally, but I mean-  No, not that literally, but yeah.  At times.  The point is, it's got to be fun.  We can't-  None of us.  We can't have this aggressive atmosphere.  It's got to be fucking fun, man.  Yeah.  Jesus, Rich.  I'm a big fan of Steve's.  So am I.  But I'm a big fan of all these guys.  I mean, they all contribute.  For real.  I mean, it's like- 
[03:13:00]  But we have to fucking have fun here.  Yeah, we really do.  And we have to keep in mind that whatever happens, it could be fodder for the air.  You know?  If-  If-  I think if you had said something, like, you know, the tape is there, and it's like,  oh, guys, I said something that was kind of stupid, we would be like, was it just talking  to Tom Jones?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  That's going on in the air.  We'll goof on it.  Or if it was, you know, my address got out, we'd never do that. 
[03:13:30]  I understand that.  Or something about a relationship, or this or that, or the-  Whatever.  That shit would never get out.  But something as silly as just stammering, because you're in, like it was said, an honest  moment in front of Tom Jones, where you're getting a little, like, fucked up about it.  That's kind of funny.  I've gotten plenty of moments like that, where, uh-  Oh, what is that?  Oh, great.  What's that?  This is, uh, this just reminded me of, it's from an old N.E.W. bit, where Anthony was trying  to do a read for, uh, wiper blades. 
[03:14:00]  Yes.  I think it had to be in Spanish, but it's a perfect example of shit that could have been  deleted.  And Steve, you love telling me how long you've been in the business.  I've only been in this business as long as you brought me into it.  I understand that.  So I've already learned to shut my mouth around open microphones, and I understand that if  I go, if I go and I do, you know, and like, let's say Derek pulls me aside, he wants  me to read something, I know that anything I say in that room is potential fodder for air.  And there's shit that I've said that he's used in, in, uh, uh, Saturday Night Virus promos. 
[03:14:30]  I knew it was there.  I was like, I know he's going to use that because I said it.  He knows how to keep his mouth shut in front of a recording thing.  And I've done it tons of times.  He doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut in front of a live on air mic.  That's-  But I'm just, I'm just saying, it's any, it's fair game.  I think once, once it's been, it's been digitized, it's fair game.  You know what, you know what, dude?  In this one specific instance, I turned the mic off because I cut the liners with Tom Jones.  I turned the mics off, potted everything down.  Then I was in the corner talking to him and they were potted back up and recorders pressed  again.  So it wasn't like I, it wasn't like I carelessly left anything on. 
[03:15:00]  So, you know, if, if my, if my attitude needs, needs an adjustment, um, well.  I just think it's more that, uh, the, the mindset has to be that material for the show is like  paramount.  That's the fucking-  You sound to me like a guy who has given up.  Like when you're talking, I'm listening to you like you feel like you've given up.  No, I haven't given up.  I have.  You sound defeated.  It's a grueling fucking experience to do this sometimes. 
[03:15:30]  It shouldn't be.  It really shouldn't be.  The stressors are different.  The stressors are different.  Absolutely.  Than they are for you, than they are for Jim, than they are for-  That is true.  I mean, but we gotta take a certain hit too.  I mean, we got, you know-  Hey, look, dude, I'm, I'm-  I haven't taken a day to walk around in your light loafers, but, um-  Yeah.  It's a queer joke.  Nah, but you can't, you gotta say, like, they say that if you want to understand a man,  you should sash-a-rate.  Sash-a-rate.  Oh!  Delete that!  No, I'm kidding. 
[03:16:00]  You should what?  Sash-a- a mile in his shoes.  Sash-a-ray.  I only wish the Pavarotti was here to photograph that moment.  Dummy.  I mean, can you imagine if this monumental idiot to my left, which is Voss, Voss, right now  thinks I'm talking about Steve.  Yeah.  Ha ha, Steve.  Steve.  How come everybody, like, everybody has such a good time around here, except for you? 
[03:16:30]  Like, you're always the one not having- everything is a mess, everything is running around, it's  a train wreck, it's- it's- it's sweating, it's putting your hands on your brow and breathing  heavily and sweaty.  I'm a fucking stressed out guy.  Why?  Why didn't I tell you?  Um, why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, if you ask me what do I not like about this job, I'd say waking up in the morning.  Yeah, that is the worst part.  And that's where it ends.  Once I'm, like, awake and on my way in, yeah, then it gets better. 
[03:17:00]  What's the matter, Jimmy?  You're listening to Intervention with a-  I don't understand why-  Intervention, by the way.  We all get along just fine, except for Steve.  Intervention.  You just can't do it.  Intervention.  What happened?  No, no, I'm doing this thing at Yale.  What?  Yeah, I'm teaching a class at Yale.  No, you're not.  A one-time thing about comedy, and I'm like, is it this Wednesday?  I think I have it in my book roll.  Yale?  I hope not.  Well.  Are you not here on Wednesday, too?  No, no, no, it's a nighttime thing, I think.  He's gonna yell at you. 
[03:17:30]  I hope it's not this week.  All right, well, you know, I think we gotta keep that in mind.  Do you get paid?  Yeah.  No.  Next time, maybe, you know.  Just walk out of the room smiling and prepare for another thing.  Well, you don't have to be so enraged that it's happening.  Like, you know, I know when I walk in, there are gonna be times where I'm gonna be fucking  firmly planted under the bus.  Sure.  I do.  It's happened to everybody.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I'm exempt from a fucking trouncing I've been fucking-  But I look at it like it's kind of fun, it's, you know, it's good for the show, it's, you 
[03:18:00]  know, it's what it is.  We bash the shit out of each- Friends bash the shit out of each other.  It's what they do.  We don't talk nicely to each other.  We fucking wear a bunch of douchebags to each other.  Makes, uh-  Yeah, that's valid.  Makes for fun radio, and-  I think, I think I'm hypersensitive to a lot of shit, and that's, that's one of my  faults.  Absolutely.  I think I'm completely hypersensitive to a lot of shit.  I also think that there's a lot of stuff that I have to deal with, too. 
[03:18:30]  See, and I just avoided a gay joke, because I'm being-  What?  Being nice guy, Jimmy?  You don't have to be a nice guy, Jimmy.  I can, you know, the gay jokes I've gotten used to at this point.  But, you know, fucking-  You said I've avoided a lot of shit.  Oh.  I was gonna say, unless it was on you.  The tip of your penis, but I didn't.  Oddly enough.  Oddly enough.  It is not an easy position to be caught in between talent and the powers that be that 
[03:19:00]  are signing your paychecks every week.  Sometimes there are odd positions to get put into, and that you get put into, and it becomes  very stressful.  Well, I don't think you'd ever find a situation where the powers that be would be mad that  you didn't delete something.  I'm not talking about that.  That's something different.  I'm talking about in the overall picture.  You want to know why I'm so stressed out?  Yes.  It's not easy.  All right?  I'm not saying it has to be. 
[03:19:30]  I fucking, I'll work my ass off.  But, you know, it's stressful.  It's stressful being in a situation where you have to deal with a volatile on-air environment,  and then people who are trying to enforce rules on that volatile on-air environment,  and then being the intermediary in between the two parties.  Do you have kids?  Trying to.  Good for you.  Thank you.  That's all that matters.  Working on it.  When it all ends and done.  Shut up.  Fucking kids.  Yeah, let them talk.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[03:20:00]  57 years old.  You know what?  If you want to relieve some of that stress, December 25th and 26th, I'll be at Uncle  Vinny's in Point Pleasant, and maybe you come down and-  Really going to work on Christmas Day?  No, 26th and 27th, I said, dummy.  No, you said 25th and 27th.  Yes, I did.  Play the tape.  I said, August.  I mean, December 26th and 27th.  Don't have been.  Why did I say?  What did I say?  You said 25th and 26th.  Oh, sorry.  I said 26th and 27th.  And even if I was working on Christmas Day, I'm going to do it.  I don't give a fuck about your dumb holiday of lights.  That's true.  Holiday of lights? 
[03:20:30]  That's us.  That's you.  That's you, dummy.  Oh, fuck.  Whatever.  Holiday of lights.  It's a festival.  It's a festival of lights.  You're right.  Whatever.  Boy, you are a lousy Jew.  You're all technical, you fuckers, man.  Technical?  Maybe that's a problem.  You were off by a messiah.  A holiday.  You're terrible.  All right, Derek has the clip.  All right, here it is.  Anybody still cares about this?  You know what?  If you want to relieve some of that stress, December 25th and 26th, I'll get it. 
[03:21:00]  There you go.  You have to do that a lot, don't you?  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  Of the jury.  I'm in a lot of physical pain today.  Really?  God damn it.  Fuck, man.  Just when the pain goes away in your stomach for months.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It sounds terrible.  It's fucking horrible.  It feels like my insides are just falling out.  You probably are.  Was I what?  Somebody gave Richard a pink sock.  Pink socked voice.  What's a pink sock?  Oh, come on.  It's when a guy pulls his large penis out of your ass, how the skin of your asshole grips 
[03:21:30]  his dick and he gets pulled out a little like a pink sock, and then his cock finally  peels off, and your skin hangs out stupidly for a minute until you tuck it back in forcefully  with an emery board.  Boss, it kind of looks like this.  No, that's not.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, damn.  It's a rectal prolapse.  That's where the inside of your asshole falls out.  Oh, it looks like a Jolly Rancher.  That looks tasty. 
[03:22:00]  Can that happen from farting or something?  It's so cherry-like.  Can that happen from trying to shit?  No.  Farting.  You're farting out a fucking acetylene torch gas tank?  A cannonball.  What would you be?  What do you eat?  Anvils?  Maybe from like trying to pinch out a loaf?  Could that happen?  Danny can pull these pictures up in seconds.  I love it.  A prolapsed asshole.  Oh, another one?  Yeah, the connection here is so slow.  That's good.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  No, this is actually something I'm trying to work.  I'm trying to work. 
[03:22:30]  I don't know.  I don't want to spoil it.  I don't want to spoil it.  You want a resume?  No, I took care of that last week.  Good one.  Yeah, I want to hear my faux pas  on that commercial.  Oh, it's kind of long.  You want to play it into break?  Well, I don't want to play the whole thing.  You want to just start it?

[03:27:00]  Yeah, the quality was really good on that recording.  It was impossible to say it twice in a row.  Bosch Micro Edge.  And I was completely hammered drunk, if you recall, like I was every day at any W.  That was afternoons, so it was kind of like after the show, and after you're drinking  all day, to try to say Bosch Micro Edge Excel Wiper Blades was a little difficult.  Bosch Micro Edge Excel Wiper Blades, Bosch Micro Edge Excel, that's hard to say. 
[03:27:30]  It is.  It was very hard to say.  That was a fun one, too.  We didn't even have that in the system.  Eric had to burn it, so I think that was the first time that ever aired on satellite.  Wow.  Well, I'd like to hear the unedited version.  Yeah, if it exists.  Because I really get mad and start calling it a cunt.  That'll happen.  All right.  I don't know if those even exist.  No.  Because everything had to be edited.  I think that was pulled off of the fucking cassette tapes.  That was somebody's VHS tape. 
[03:28:00]  Back in the old days.  Oh, yeah, someone's VHS.  Someone used to tape the show on VHS tape.  Yeah, that would be me.  Just the audio.  Oh, was it you?  Yeah.  Oh, someone.  Some tool used to...  Some queer.  Yeah, who's the jizz bag of...  Some incompetent queer.  Who's the hypersensitive...  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Was that your girlfriend at the wedding or your wife?  Your wife.  No, that was my girlfriend.  You're not married.  Not anymore.  That's why it's your girlfriend.  That's why it's my girlfriend.  Apparently, they don't tell you that when you get married, you're supposed to stop dating. 
[03:28:30]  So...  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  That was awful.  You're divorced?  Yes, Rich.  Since when?  Yeah, I got divorced...  Fuck.  Papers were signed two months ago.  Well, the girl at the wedding was very attractive.  You did very well on that one.  Thank you very much, Rich.  She actually helped stupid Bob Kelly get into shape.  Don't want to call her to work out a plan for me.  Apparently, Bob's coming in tomorrow.  Call her to curse her out. 
[03:29:00]  She fucking ruined a good joke.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  You cost us a lot of audio.  Wait, what is she?  She's a trainer?  She's a professional bodybuilder.  She has AIDS and a vial, and she gives it to people, and they drink it and lose weight.  Well, she could be a nutritionist, stupid, or a trainer.  Was that...  She could be a nutritionist or a trainer.  Yes, I know, but to me, the AIDS joke was funny, so I said it.  Oh, but don't call me stupid.  I mean, I wasn't stupid.  Oh, come on.  Sorry, Einstein.  That's a typical, normal question.  Don't call you stupid?  You said it was the Pavarotti there.  Yeah, because we're going to call her and check to help you out. 
[03:29:30]  Don't call me late for stupid.  You can call me Ray, or you can call me Dummy, but please don't call me stupid.  You can call my syndrome Downs.  I don't think you said to.  What's that tattoo on your left arm?  Oh, this?  You're not going to start goofing on people's tats.  No, I want to see that.  What's wrong with that?  That's a cool tattoo.  I wasn't goofing on it.  Danny has a tattoo.  It's the Little Mermaid. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, it looks like the fucking camera from when the Abbott and Costello movies would start.  Remember the fucking old school cameras going on with wings and a head?  It's the cover of an old book from the 30s called Who Goes There?  A few books from the 30s I like.  Who went there?  No one knows them.  They all got burned.  Hard to translate a few.  How come it's not colored in?  It's just the way the piece was.  It's the original drawing. 
[03:30:30]  It just wasn't colored.  How old is that?  Not very old at all.  I think I got it in March.  Cool.  Are you going to start working on your arm so it looks like fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That was an insult.  I knew it was going somewhere.  No, I didn't see the tattoo.  You can only see the bottom half, so I was wondering what it was.  It's not a fucking star of David.  Yeah, the artist was really good.  Get a Jew tattoo like Voss has to start David.  Yeah, no thanks.  That's a good one.  Are you Jewish, Danny?  Some parts of my family are, but I don't partake. 
[03:31:00]  Are you like Ray Lione?  Only the good parts.  What are you parts of your family, like your mom or your dad?  No, my parents don't practice.  My grandparents barely practiced, but they tried to keep the Jew thing happening.  How do you practice not tip?  That's such an old stereotype.  Yeah, it is.  I know.  New Jews tip.  Do they?  They never went to...  What are you?  Do you know why old Jews don't tip?  Do you know why?  Why don't old Jews tip?  I actually, I think I do know.  Oh, why?  They're cheap. 
[03:31:30]  Because everything throughout their life was taken from them throughout history.  God, here comes an Obama line.  So...  Now you're talking like you're African American, that everything was taken, slavery, this,  that.  Make excuses.  Leave a tip for the girl.  Good point.  Leave a tip.  Put in a dollar.  But your parents are Jews, like, even though they don't practice your religions, you're a  Jew.  Well, if that's the way that you want to look at it.  Well, I'm saying...  Rich wants everyone to be Jewish. 
[03:32:00]  I love how when somebody is supposed to be Jewish.  Yeah.  Like, it's this whole...  It's like, oh, well, you're Jewish.  No.  I don't practice through...  I don't...  I'm an atheist.  I don't believe in God.  I'm an atheist.  Yeah, but your parents are Jewish.  Yeah, I guess.  Well, so you're Jewish.  No, Rich.  You have to practice a religion to be that religion.  No, that's not true at all.  Yes, it is true.  You still be it, but you don't follow it or practice...  You're still it, though.  You're still it.  You're still a Jew.  So you're saying Jew is, like, saying you're Italian.  If you fill out something that says Jew or Catholic, you're going to put Jew. 
[03:32:30]  Nothing says Jew or Catholic on it.  There's nothing that asks a religion to hang at your house.  Where are you, Russia?  Who asked you that?  Christ?  What potential lawsuit will I be filing that I'm checking that box off?  What I'm saying is you don't have to practice.  You still are.  It's your blood.  No, your blood.  Your blood is that.  See, you're using Jewish like I would use Italian or Irish or something.  No, and it's not supposed to be like that.  And that's a huge thing.  I've heard Jews say, no, it's a religion.  It's a religion. 
[03:33:00]  It's not.  Exactly.  It's still blood, though.  It's still blood, though.  It's still...  Whatever.  People...  No, sort of.  Not really.  People seem to think that being Jewish is like a race of people.  It's just like, oh, yeah, he's half Jewish, half Italian.  It's like...  No.  You can't be half Jewish.  You're right.  It's like a half Catholic and half Irish.  But it's a religion with a bloodline from a certain area in the world, and the bloodline  is a Jewish bloodline.  How come you can convert to Judaism or convert to Catholicism?  Man, yes.  But you're still not...  You can't convert to Irish.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, I did.  Convert to...  That's right.  He's trying his best.  That's right.  The liver.  The Irish actually tipped their cap to the liver.  That's right.  Harder than a Blarney's tone.  But why?  Were you beat up a lot when you were a kid because you were Jews?  No, I just...  I just...  From very early on, I was never interested in it.  He wants everyone to be Jewish.  I...  You know, my grandparents wanted me to get bar mitzvah.  I had no interest in it whatsoever.  I did it for them because they were old and going to die.  You were bar mitzvahed?  Yeah.  Well, he didn't even hear the mitzvah part.  Yes. 
[03:34:00]  I'm going to the bar.  There's this place called mitzvah.  I thought they were taking me to a club.  It's bar mitzvah.  Well, here's the bar.  The flashing neon light.  Bar mitzvah.  Bar mitzvah.  During the invasion of the Germans.  Can I point out that we've been on five rolls already and you keep seriasing them up with fucking Jewish facts.  Let me tell you about the Holocaust.  What I'm saying is... 
[03:34:30]  Every time we're talking about seven silly, he's like, all kidding aside, there was a lot of suffering.  No, I'm not saying that.  What I'm saying is...  What I'm saying is...  Okay.  We were at the same socks.  You do?  We were on a bar mitzvah roll.  Pink ones.  You can't go.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut off your...  No, that's okay.  I'm sorry.  I was wrong.  And then...  Go ahead.  You let Steve slip out.  Back in World War II, it was very sad.  Well, what happened in World War II?  Like, give us a fucking boss history lesson.  I love this.  I'm not giving a history.  What I'm saying to him is, you know, when the Nazi troops were storming, coming in and 
[03:35:00]  snatching up Jews, if you said to them, hey, I don't practice, they wouldn't have gave  a fuck.  Okay?  Hey.  So you're saying that the Nazis, they were the ones that set the bar?  That's right, Joe.  But see, Rich, I live in a time and day where they have electric cars and the internet, so  I don't have to worry about some people throwing me on a train to Auschwitz.  I'm like, I don't ever have to worry about that.  So...  He's taking the Nazi fucking definition of a Jew. 
[03:35:30]  I know.  And that's what it...  Get some more Star David tattoos.  Yeah.  Okay, get some gargoyle ones, okay?  All right.  You saw a book for three years.  I got a string of diamonds going.  Argoil socks.  Gargoyle sweater.  Gargoyle, whatever.  Uh, get some more gargoyle.  That's a gargoyle. 
[03:36:00]  Gargoyle.  Oh, are you stupid?  I'm so tired.  I've never been that tired.  And then Anthony, without missing a breath, put out some Argoil socks.  Oh, Rich.  What a gem.  What a gargoyle.  So World War II, right?  They said that a Jew is a Jew is a Jew is a Jew. 
[03:36:30]  I'm not religious at all.  Okay?  I don't...  I'm not religious.  But I still believe, you know, in, you know, supporting...  So you want all the reward with none of the work that has to go into...  No, I don't get no reward.  No, my reward is...  There you go.  Oh, that was fantastic.  Jimmy did what he usually does.  He pulled his pants down and spread his asshole open and was probably ready to cut him right at Rich. 
[03:37:00]  And Rich quickly picked up a giant Sharpie and shoved it in Jim's asshole.  Push that part back.  Where you heard, ow.  But imagine if I had a fake ow.  Imagine if I would have went, ooh, and then came on my legs.  That would have had some splatting to do.  What if you pulled out the Sharpie and it looked like this?  The realest thing about that is the Sharpie was black-tipped. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, sorry.  Why, Rich?  Sorry.  Is it hot in here?  It is now for you.  Exactly.  I'm bombing off of the clothes.  It's hot.  It's hot.  Oh, shit.  Argoil socks.  Fucking rich.  You are the best.  Oh.  The tongue should just be cut out of your fucking head and preserved in a museum.  It should be in the fucking. 
[03:38:00]  Museum of Dummy.  The Tart Hall of Fame.  Ty Cobb's glove in baseball and his tongue.  Not the fattest one we've seen, but he had as many blithering idiotic things and passed over it.  It's the tongue where 10 million dumb thoughts were launched.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Fucking Rich.  Oh, my God.  Who doesn't love Rich Voss? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  My eyes hurt.  Where the hell are you going to be there, Rich?  Please tell the people so they can go and see you.  Oh, fuck.  January 26th and 27th.  December.  December.  December.  Oh, my God.  Is he the worst?  You really are a horse's patoot.  December 26th and 27th at Uncle Vinny's and New Year's Eve.  Two shows at Treehouse and Danbury.  New Year's Eve.  Two shows.  I've never got that two shows on New Year's Eve thing.  It's kind of like. 
[03:39:00]  After the first one's done, you do it on.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I didn't get that.  The first one, I'm doing a door deal, so I need the first one to sell.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because, you know, it's New Year's Eve, and then what happens?  The people leave and got to go somewhere else for New Year's Eve?  Yeah, some people want to come early and then just get home early.  They want to go out and do something.  Yeah.  And they're like, all right, let's just go out and, you know, do something.  What shithole is this, though?  Yeah.  Like, what is there to do but see you at this place?  Remember the worst dinner New Year's Eve we had when we left and went to that place 
[03:39:30]  on the diner?  Oh, it was horrible.  We were off the air.  We were off the air at the time.  We went to the diner in Times Square.  Patrice.  Was he with us?  Yeah, Patrice was there.  You with your chick?  Yeah, I was there with Melinda.  Melinda, you were there.  That was like 2004.  And it was the worst shit.  You got this disgusting fucking herring shit.  Did I?  No.  It was disgusting. 
[03:40:00]  And then he kept sending it back because it was bad.  That was the worst fucking...  And who brought us there?  Who said it was great?  Was that your fault?  No, it wasn't.  I've never eaten there before.  Blame it on the black guy.  I don't know.  Who else could have said it?  Maybe it was you.  Coming up, the bananas are great.  That place was terrible.  It stunk.  How did we all end up?  How did we end up with you guys?  Oh, you were at Dangerfields that night or something, weren't you?  I think I was at Caroline's.  I was working at Caroline's.  I used to go to Caroline's for New Year's Eve a lot. 
[03:40:30]  And then they started having comics that I didn't really like there on New Year's Eve.  And Opie and Anthony's show, we're doing a pay-per-view.  Oh, yes.  I'm going to make that announcement.  Just make it.  Yes.  And we'll make it happen.  We are doing a pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Finally.  We'll put the word out on who and what we need to get this done.  Can I come?  We will want some audience participation.  We'll put the word out, let you know what we're looking for, and you can be part of it. 
[03:41:00]  Yes, you can be.  Mm-hmm.  I just can't get over Rich's mouth.  Gargile.  Yeah, gargile.  What do we got?  Are we doing, what did we learn?  Or are we doing line of the day?  We can do, what did we learn?  I think that we should probably announce that.  We're going to do, what did we learn?  We can take a quick...  I want to take one phone call today.  Take a quick break and we can come.  What's the phone number?  I hate the phones.  Phone number is 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969 if you want to call with your what did you learns. 
[03:41:30]  How about we take a quick break and we come back?  We could do that and finish up the program with, what did we learn?  I like it.  Very good.  On this Opie and Anthony show.  On Monday.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say, it's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you, I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, fiends, I want my money.  A bronc. 
[03:42:00]  Tail.  Fiends, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on, what are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20 and it's been two weeks now and every time he sees me, he keeps dying  to me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue  with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him. 
[03:42:30]  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  Cost you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A Bronx tale.  How do you know the right ass all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time and I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  Hi. 
[03:43:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, that was a good one.  Of course, Opie is still on his honeymoon.  He got married.  Married.  And I guess they went away to some paradise somewhere.  Some people doing their honeymoon.  Left us here to hold down a fort to actually come in and do a show. 
[03:43:30]  He is back on Wednesday.  Yes.  As the new married guy.  Imagine he comes back and just is like, oh my God.  We got in such a fight.  It's hell.  It's hell.  I never thought it could be this bad marriage.  Yeah.  That's how I was.  Why shouldn't it happen to someone else, please?  Day one of my marriage sucked.  Day one. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Right from day one.  Fucking believe in that shit.  That's what happens when you buy your wedding ring at Penn Station on your way to fucking  Boston.  Wow.  Last minute kind of a thing.  It's like, yeah, why not?  Let me get engaged.  This sounds like a good idea.  I'll buy it by the piss-smelling jewelry store at Penn Station.  I bought mine at an AA meeting from a guy whose girlfriend relapsed.  Did you really?  Yeah.  It's from a, yeah, I got it from a guy.  Taking advantage.  It's good anonymity.  Yeah.  What?  I didn't use any names, dummy. 
[03:44:30]  I mean yours.  Huh?  It was a, because of my AAA meeting, there's no anonymity in AAA.  Oh, my God.  There's no what?  Adamantity?  I said, anonymity.  There's no D in anonymity.  It's adamantia.  It's what Wolverine's bones are made out of.  Or an adedictomy.  He got that sex change operation.  You're right.  I screwed up.  I had a 12-step meeting.  Are you dead?  Anyway, line of the day.  Well, or what did you learn? 
[03:45:00]  Or, yes.  And or, what did you learn?  It's brought to you by Step Brothers.  Hey, now available on DVD, Blu-ray, high def, and PSP.  Step Brothers stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly.  It's rated R for crude and sexual content and pervasive language.  Available in both theatrical and unrated versions.  Here comes, what did we learn? 
[03:45:30]  What did we learn?  Ooh.  I like Jimmy singing that.  Coke Logic.  Well, our buddy Coke Logic learned something today.  What did you learn there, Coke?  Good evening.  Today I learned that all but three listeners of O&A are big fat men.  True.  All but three.  Hey, can I ask the listener?  I just need a couple of listeners to do me a question. 
[03:46:00]  Do me a favor if you could.  Could somebody make a Photoshop of me as a girl, but using a real photo of me?  Don't use anybody else's work.  Um, somebody use a Photoshop of me as a girl.  If you could, to mail it to yellowtreats at AOL.com.  Is this your new ad on Craigslist?  No, no, no, no, no.  I want to, I'm doing something.  Um, there's a reason for it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah.  Thank you.  That's why, that's why he should be. 
[03:46:30]  That is right.  That's exactly why.  Yes.  Meanwhile, today we mentioned 40 bands and E-Rock was looking for the record albums.  Dropped the ball on every single one of them.  I agree.  So, Derek, why are you not with us at CBS?  I have, uh, no idea, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  I can answer that for you.  Oh, and there's no gear over there for me to use either.  Yeah, there's not a lot of room.  Like, space is extremely limited over there. 
[03:47:00]  So, I mean, the facility that he gets to use in that room far outshines anything that  they have over at CBS.  I know, but he's so good with the music cues.  Well, there's more room if E-Rock wasn't over there.  Uh, yeah, let's go to, uh, Chicago.  Nope.  Hi, Brian.  Good morning.  What did we learn?  I learned a lot of things today.  One of them is that if you're Catholic, your socks have wings.  Your socks have wings.  Oh, oh, God. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, okay, Argoil.  Argoil.  Yes, look at us.  We can't even remember.  Thank you, sir.  Paz.  Paz.  What's up, man?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  What did you learn today?  Well, I want to say first, hey to Jimmy.  Hey.  I love your book, and I went out and bought five more for a little stocking stuffers.  Thank you.  I had three weeks on the bestseller list.  I don't know if I'll have a fourth.  We could ask stuffers, too.  Yes, they certainly do. 
[03:48:00]  How do you?  Well, I've learned that Rich Boss is a fucking idiot, and that Steve C is still gay.  Hmm.  Can you come see me?  Where are you calling from?  Op, Mississippi.  Oh.  Is there anything going on down there?  Robert.  Mississippi.  Back to you on the instant feedback.  Steve from Bayshore says,  Yesterday, I learned that E-Rock doesn't need Opie in studio to get yelled at.  Yeah, that's true.  Robert.  Hey there, Bab.  How you doing? 
[03:48:30]  What's up, man?  I learned that I never appreciated Opie as much as I have today.  Why is that, sir?  Oh, you guys are great, but you guys are missing the captain of your ship.  Yeah.  The captain of the ship?  Kind of.  He's got it moving it forward.  Love you guys.  You guys are awesome.  Jimmy, love the book.  We stayed on one subject the whole day?  No, not at all.  Well, then go fuck yourself.  You're good.  You're good.  Op.  Thanks.  All right.  Take care, Op.  Take care, Op. 
[03:49:00]  Shit.  What about Canada?  Let's talk to one of our friends from the great white north.  Oh, good.  I hope it's a fat person that's happy they can get on a plane now.  Hi, Canada.  Dave, go.  It's you.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I just wanted to say that I actually felt dumber today after listening to Rich Voss' views on Judaism.  Are you a Jew?  I could be, according to Rich. 
[03:49:30]  He doesn't practice.  But according to the Nazis, it doesn't matter.  Shut up.  You're from Canada.  Nobody cares about you.  Canadian Jews.  I think they have those.  Fucking dummies.  Dumb Canada.  All right, fuck it.  We'll take one more and get the fuck out of here.  Why?  These are going so well.  Yeah, right.  The magic is flowing.  And we should absolutely go back to line of the day.  We're much better than the listeners.  Of course we are.  Why can't we do both?  Why are they mutually exclusive things? 
[03:50:00]  Why can't we just do both?  Because that would take too long?  We can't.  We just didn't have any lines today.  And it was nothing.  That's not saying anything about today's show.  It's just we're understaffed and we just didn't have the resources today.  The resources to pluck the lines.  We can do one.  This one's not bad.  Rick in North, uh, North Hampshire.  North Hampshire.  It's NH, so it's got to be North Hampshire.  North Hampshire.  North Carol Hampshire.  Good morning, guys.  I learned two things today.  One, BCN management sucks and deserves to get the ramrod room treatment. 
[03:50:30]  And I also learned that, uh, Rich Voss' tongue is where words go to die.  Should have just stuck in the first one.  Yeah.  All right.  Cut your losses.  You've got to close out something strong.  I cut a good fart on the elevator coming up.  Oh, that was brilliant.  Oh, my God.  That poor fucking lady that was getting off on the fourth floor.  That was a loud one, too.  She didn't want to hear that.  I was laughing so hysterically.  And I was trying to hide the fact that I was laughing at Jim's ass.  So I just went, oh, Kenny, because Kenny had done something funny like four floors ago.  So I tried to pretend that I was still laughing at that. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, Jim, you got a parting comment?  I want to see if I can, wait, there's paper here.  Let me see if I can move it.  Oh, see if you can move paper with telekinesis farts.  I think he shit himself.  Can you move?  Do you know how many gigs just fell out of his ass?  I think you shit yourself.  Oh, Jesus.  Did that make a sound?  All right.  What a perfect way to end the show. 
[03:51:30]  That's wonderful.  I have to do the line.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, one more.  Yeah, of course I do.  That beautiful line of the day and what Jimmy finished off with.  Brought to you by Step Brothers.  Step Brothers.  Now available on DVD, Blu-ray, high def, and PSP.  Step Brothers stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly.

[03:52:00]  Tomorrow we will be back.  And, yeah, Ope comes back about Wednesday.  Something like that.  So we will see you tomorrow.  Thank you, Rich Voss.  Thank you.  For chiming in every so often with some bit of brilliance.  And we'll see you tomorrow, man.  The country is moving in a new direction right now.  Jump on the train and be with everybody else.  Jump on the train.  That's right.  The boxcar to house.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  America's foul mouth.  You don't like something. 
[03:52:30]  So you're trying to create reasons as to why other people shouldn't enjoy it.  Filthy four-letter word.  Goddamn C word.  You're a C word.  You're doing all of these things to get around the fact that if you don't like it, other people shouldn't hear it.  And it ends with a T, that whole thing.  There is no need for disgusting, perverted, filthy language.  Stop thinking for others and live your life.  Ya, ya, friggin' blind bitch.  The virus.  XM 202.
