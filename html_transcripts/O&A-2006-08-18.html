<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and guest Patrice O'Neal (filling in for Jim Norton, who was performing in Houston) along with in-studio DJ Drew Boogie.  The hosts began with self-deprecating insults, calling themselves names like "cretins," "retards," and "corn balls."  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to reading Kenny's absurdly detailed two-page "Instructions for Mike," outlining Opie's meticulously planned pre-show routine, down to the specific time of his 4:55 AM doorbell ring and his breakfast cereal.  They also discussed Bob Saget's unexpectedly dirty stand-up routine and a YouTube bootleg of it, and promoted their upcoming "Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus" comedy tour.

The show featured a discussion about a recent in-studio appearance by Whoopi Goldberg, their disdain for her radio show (described as "shit"), and how they forced an on-air apology from her for past negative comments about them.  They noted Goldberg's discussion of the incident on *Letterman*, and criticized her perceived shift towards a more family-friendly radio persona.

A significant segment focused on "Homeless Radio," featuring clips from Tippy Tom, a homeless man with erratic behavior and unusual views (like his take on the liquid bomb plot).  The hosts graphically described Tippy Tom's appearance and hygiene.  A song about Tippy Tom by another homeless man, Gray Wolf, was played. Listener calls followed, discussing Jim Norton's performance, Whoopi Goldberg, and Tippy Tom.

The show heavily featured comedic speculation on *Snakes on a Plane*, with listener-generated ideas for similar films like "possums in a bank" and "bees in a car." A short, supposedly exclusive, interview with Samuel L. Jackson about the film was also aired. This segment concluded with a vulgar on-air segment featuring a caller, "Stalker Patty," who was subjected to numerous offensive remarks from the hosts about her appearance.

The broadcast included discussion of Britney Spears' pregnancy and Haley Joel Osment's drunk driving arrest, a news story about a chocolate Virgin Mary, and Mel Gibson's legal troubles. A major segment was a "walk over" street broadcast.  A listener gave Anthony a World War II German helmet, which he wore for a staged experiment: he and Patrice O'Neal competed to see who could hail a cab first.  This experiment involved racial humor and purportedly demonstrated a bias against Black people in cab selection.  Big A participated, singing karaoke.  Drew and Danny were also present in the studio.

Further listener calls followed the "walk over" segment, including sex advice from Sue Johansson (who discussed anal farts and arousal), a call from a trucker, and a discussion about wrestler Bubba Ray Dudley.  A listener-submitted audio clip of a man using his testicles to insert a butt plug was played.  The show heavily promoted an upcoming Opie and Anthony show and a wedding reception, along with a recap of the cab experiment and its social commentary.

The show concluded with announcements of upcoming events:  a comedy show at PNC a week away featuring Opie, Anthony, Drew Boogie, and potentially Dice Gay. A new commercial (available on opianathlete.com) and various videos were to be shown.  Patrice's shows at Caroline's were promoted. Big A performed "Waiting for a Girl Like You," and the hosts ended the broadcast with strong profanity, expressing their excitement for leaving. The very end involved a humorous, self-deprecating introduction of the hosts and crew using vulgar and insulting language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Wild, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We got Drew Boogie spinning live in studio today.  We like to do that the day before vacation. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  It gives us like a party atmosphere Opie.  We like to keep it festive the day before vacation.  Yeah.  Keep it light and airy.  Absolutely.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's our phone number.  1-866-313-FREE.  Lots to do today.  Lots of fun to be had.  Right off the bat we got to welcome Patrice O'Neill.  Sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Good morning.  Jim Norton's at the Houston Improv all weekend long.  Houston.  Houston.  He flew out yesterday, so we got Patrice sitting in today. 
[00:02:30]  Hello.  And we're very happy that Patrice is here.  Hello, Opie.  This is the first time I've seen you.  Hello, Patrice.  Hello, Anthony.  Good morning.  Good to you.  Hello, Martini Steven.  Hi, Patrice.  This is the first time we're seeing you since being on that stage in Worcester.  The gig.  The match show, yeah.  And I was telling Patrice off, Mike, I'll say it on air, he killed.  Yeah.  And I thought, you know, he was there for the rest of the show, and then I realized he wasn't  because he had to do another show right after that. 
[00:03:00]  He had to jump in his ride and get down to what, Foxwoods or something?  He's like when Sinatra or Heston or a big star would have gone on The Tonight Show.  Right.  They show up, but you think they're sliding over on the couch waiting for someone else to come on?  It's just like, I got something to do.  And Johnny's like, all right, hey, you can take it easy.  Gotta go.  Got your drink in your hand.  You know, gotta go, Johnny.  I'm not going to question it.  And, yeah, like Johnny's going to ask, where do you got to go?  You're Sinatra.  I wish Johnny would have said one time, where do you have to go?  Where are you going?  He never questioned it.  You know, like someone like Dino would have just spilt his drink on him and go, go F yourself. 
[00:03:30]  Go where I want.  That was a great show, man.  Oh.  Patrice killed.  Yeah.  You opened the show, right?  Yeah, man.  Because you had to get out.  Yeah, I had to get to go back to Mohegan Sun and do a little something, something.  Ooh.  And then, but that was a good show, man.  Voss did a good job.  Yeah, he did.  I missed, I stayed until the break, until after Bob Saget, who was killing two.  I know.  But Bob Saget killed.  His, someone bootlegged his performance and it's up on YouTube.  It should be.  God bless. 
[00:04:00]  You know what?  God bless Bob, man.  Somebody should bootleg his act and let everybody know he's not the lame that we all think he  is.  He's a hilarious dude, man.  More and more people are finding out that he's a dirty, dirty boy.  They did, I guess, one of those each true Hollywood stories on that TV show.  Yeah.  How was it?  How was he on?  Facts of.  No.  Full House.  Facts of House.  Full House.  Full.  He was on the one when they did the, about ghosts at the comedy cellar.  At the comedy.  Who was in that one? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, that was, I think that was Bob's.  Yeah.  Yeah, they showed him and they just showed him doing his act and being dirty.  Uh, even before he got the part and then they showed him on the show doing all those  schmalsy scenes with the kids, you know, it's all about loving each other and being  a family and we're, and I'm just watching laughing because I, I know what this guy's  about.  Fast forward a few years, he's up there in Worcester on that stage saying what he would  do to cast a Full House.  Oh.  I know.  Destroying.  You, you, you gotta have a giant level of respect for that as opposed to Dave's 
[00:05:00]  Coolier.  Dave's Coolier, where, remember when he did, what's that show, uh, Surreal Life?  Oh, yeah.  And he, and he, and he go, and what's his name from NSYNC or whatever, new kids on the  block, he goes, man, I like them, mmm, those old's and twins.  And then they did that, that short stop, like, dude, I raised those kids.  It was like, shut up, shut up.  They're like daughters to me.  Shut up.  Go in the rest of America.  We all want to do the twins.  Treat them like John Carr.  I look at my second cousin and go, damn it. 
[00:05:30]  But, uh, Patrice is going to be at the PNC Arts Center as long, uh, as, uh, as well as  Bob Saget and Carl Smith.  See you and Jim Norton and the rest of the gang, you know, and love the Opie and Anthony  Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  We're going away starting tomorrow.  So, uh, the next time we're going to be around is, uh, at this show.  So the week leading up to the big comedy show, we can't promote it, which kind of sucks,  but, uh, hopefully you'll be there.  August 26th, PNC Bank Arts Center in Jersey. 
[00:06:00]  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations.  And that's presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Yeah.  So there you go.  We got to talk about John Carr today.  We got to talk about Club Soda Kenny.  You want to start with the Club Soda Kenny and let Patrice have a little breakfast there?  Yeah, I think we have to.  Because I can't sit here and concentrate on anything else when this is in front of us.  We work with a complete lunatic.  Well, he has, uh, he has OCD. 
[00:06:30]  A lot of us have OCD on this show.  It's beyond OCD.  Most humans have OCD.  I thought I had OCD pretty bad when it comes to things.  And, uh, hanging out with Kenny, I feel like a completely normal human being as far as OCD goes.  I don't know.  OCD must cover a pretty wide range.  Because I have nothing like this.  No, it's all-encompassing.  I have nothing like what I'm looking at on this piece of paper from Club Soda Kenny.  You could have the cleaning OCD where you scrub, scrub, scrub right down to the bones.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Where you got to wash your hands.  A million times.  You could have the OCD where you have to check the oven a million times before you leave the apartment.  I have to put my left shoe on before my right one every morning.  Is that OCD?  That's OCD.  But that's like OCD that you can kind of control and it doesn't really affect your life.  No, it does.  If I put my right one on accidentally, I have to take my shoes off and put my left shoe on first again.  Well...  But that's more of a superstition thing than OCD.  You know, like when, uh, when, uh, players, uh, baseball players get into the playoffs, they start doing things very ritualistic? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  I just kind of do that as a ritual for the show.  But that's a quickie.  I want the show to go well.  That's a quickie.  That's easy.  There are people that have to like, you know, check the locks on their, on the house like, uh, a certain number of times, 17, 18 times.  See, now I've been...  And then turn in a circle and then make sure they don't step on any lines on their way to the car.  And if they screw it up, they got to start the whole routine over.  And then it takes a really long time for them to leave their house.  Not crazy like that, but I do think every time you go on vacation or leave, it's just natural. 
[00:08:00]  It's not OCD to think, oh my God, did I do that?  Did I lock this?  Did I take care of that?  But, uh, we, we always like me and my girlfriend look at each other and just go, ah, screw it.  If we get ripped off, what's going to happen?  You know, it's not, it doesn't compel me, even if I'm a block away to turn that car around and take a look.  Yeah.  I don't get, ah, the stove's on.  It could be on a week.  I remember...  It's safe these days.  I remember once when we were living in Boston, I was almost, uh, to Boston for a comedy show or something.  And I was living in Wellesley. 
[00:08:30]  And so it's a pretty good hike, uh, into the city.  I had to turn all the way around, even though I was literally, I don't know, two to three minutes away from the comedy connection.  I had to go all the way back because I was convinced the stove was on and that was going to be a real problem.  I remember that.  Were you in the car?  Yeah.  I screwed up everyone's night.  And I was like, because you, you know what it was?  You were talking about it the whole time.  Like every, every yard we got further and further away from the house, you just kept talking about it.  And I just said, dude, turn around and check. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Because this is going to screw your whole night up.  What's the danger of leaving an oven on?  Honestly, I...  I don't know.  It's an oven.  I understand.  I understand that it's stupid.  You're right.  No, Patrice, I understand it's stupid, but it's something that happens in your head and you're like, oh, God, I got to just check and then I can relax for the rest of the night.  My OCD comes in when I'm really tired.  Then it kind of takes over a little bit.  There are people that have OCD where if they're driving and they hit a pothole, every little thing that they, every bump on the car, they think they hit somebody. 
[00:09:30]  And they have to stop, back up, and look around and make sure they didn't run somebody over.  Get back in the car, drive.  They hit another pothole.  Boom.  Boom.  Oh, I think I hit somebody.  This is the whole way that they're driving wherever they got to go.  How do you survive like that?  That's hilarious.  That's a crazy one.  Mine is getting my nipples licked.  Have your OCD.  That's my OCD.  Lick that away.  Ain't going to happen.  Well, we can't go.  I really need you to do this or you can't leave alive. 
[00:10:00]  Well, we're not going to dinner.  I mean, you got to do that, and then I can concentrate on going to dinner with you in a movie.  Leave that oven on.  Right.  I could care less.  Anyway, Kenny's instructions for Mike is where this is heading.  Kenny has gotten into a ritual every morning.  He's a part of this program.  He takes care of things.  He makes sure everything runs smoothly so we can concentrate on the program.  See, there's a piece of my brain and there's a piece of Anthony's brain that just doesn't work. 
[00:10:30]  It shut down probably when we were born.  Well, apparently, the piece of your brain shut down a little more than mine.  Well, we'll get into that.  Yes, we will.  But Kenny has that piece of his brain.  It's most of his brain.  That's the only part of my brain.  And that's why this works so well, this arrangement.  You know, I suck at details.  I suck with trying to get myself together, whether it's going on a trip or traveling for the radio show or just trying to get here in the morning.  I suck. 
[00:11:00]  I realize by reading this that I would be fine after a nuclear holocaust.  Like, I am really low maintenance.  I could just walk through the rubble.  If I find something useful, I could take it.  Right, right.  But this, to me, Kenny's instructions to Mike, because Kenny's away.  With Jim Norton.  And Mike is standing in for Kenny.  Kenny's instructions written out in two pages, and it is just ridiculous. 
[00:11:30]  We've got to get this up on the website.  I want to be fair and ask Club Soda Kenny if we can post this.  But it starts off, Kenny's instructions for Mike.  And then it says, Mike, I usually do the following.  Now, the first one shows that he's actually learning because he would show up in my house every morning at 4.55.  He was obsessed with ringing my bell at 4.55 every morning.  Exactly.  Exactly, without fail.  4.55.  We've joked about that on the show, that it's 4.55, Kenny. 
[00:12:00]  So he's giving you five minutes.  And I said, Kenny, just show up at 5, whatever, 4.57, I don't care.  Stop at the 4.55 every morning.  It started annoying me.  That is labeled A, by the way, the first thing.  A.  He labeled everything in alphabetical order.  He goes all the way to the letter O.  Right.  Oh.  A.  All right, go ahead.  So, Mike, I usually do the following.  And we got Mike Cole on mic here.  A, 0.500 hours. 
[00:12:30]  He did this in military time.  Yeah.  Did Mike do this?  Oh, 4.55.  Yeah, you were right there.  He rang the bell at 4.55.  He rang the bell at 4.55 just to bust my ass.  I thought he was going to get five minutes extra.  Knowing the 4.55 bothers the crap out of me.  And that's probably my OCD kicking in.  Will you stop at the 4.55?  That's good.  So, Mike has a great sense of humor.  He's ringing my bell at 4.55 knowing that I'm checking the clocks in my joint.  All right, now we are into an hour into this. 
[00:13:00]  Like, right now, real time is an hour into the schedule.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  0.500, pick up Opie at his apartment and drive him to the studio.  This is coordinated the night before by phone or email.  He should bring his backpack and rollerblades.  The backpack should contain a spoon, a bowl, his notepad, and sometimes a yogurt, blueberries, and a banana. 
[00:13:30]  Stop at the corner store if he does not bring these.  Make sure he has a sissy kid available, Mike.  His tinder blueberries.  Make sure he has his wallet in his left hand when somebody's robbing him.  He's a sissy kid.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I like to eat healthy, and he makes it sound like a sissy kid. 
[00:14:00]  I can't even defend myself.  You're right.  And usually, I let him into the apartment while I'm getting changed, and he'll go in the kitchen and wash the bowl and the spoon.  Oh, my God.  Hazel.  He puts my backpack together like my mom would have back in the day.  See, that's what it is.  When I was like 10.  This is fine, but it should be worded somewhere like, you know, 5 o'clock, pick up Opie, make sure he's got his backpack with his food in it, and his rollerblades. 
[00:14:30]  That's it.  He's got everything listed here.  Right.  Like, it's laid out on an evidence table.  Right.  But there's no word.  You can't say backpacking, man.  It has to be like, let's show Opie has his stuff.  Briefcase.  Briefcase with straps that might go on his back if he feels it necessary.  If you ask Opie, what's your stuff?  Like, when you get there, hey, what's your stuff, Opie?  Blueberries and whatever.  Yeah.  No, Kenny knows.  Kenny knows.  Put his juicy in.  Make sure his sippy cup is in one of the pockets of his backy pack. 
[00:15:00]  With the little straw.  Little straw that pokes through the cardboard juicy.  I had to boost the seat in the car.  Yeah.  Make sure the car seat is strapped in properly.  And GH is facing rearward.  Turn the airbag off because this can injure a child.  Oh, my God.  His sissy kid.  Goddamn Patrice.  You rock, Patrice.  All right.  That's A.  That's A.  Yeah, that's just A, people. 
[00:15:30]  Go ahead.  B.  Let's go to B.  B.  Which is a mere 15 minutes later because I do understand military time.  Oh, 1500.  Kenny's instructions for Mike who's filling in today.  Go ahead.  Oh, 15, upon arrival, make sure that he has newspapers, and then he, parentheses there,  post, Daily News, USA Today, and Newsday.  Check office and office fridge, and hopefully there is skim milk and honey nut Cheerios. 
[00:16:00]  If not, send an intern to Dwayne Reed, 57th and 6th, for same.  He showed me yesterday where the Cheerios were.  Did he?  Yes.  Get Opie coffee from the CBS kitchen.  Milk, no sugar.  This is an entire paragraph dedicated to newspapers, cereal, and coffee.  Yeah, yeah.  Did this happen, Mike?  Yes.  So this happened.  No, wait a minute.  Okay, okay.  I walked in and got my own goddamn coffee.  Oh, let me tell you something that just freaks me out every morning. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  It is like, I can't even describe it.  Kenny will not only, you would think, as long as the stuff's there, everything's fine.  Opie is, he's not a paraplegic.  Right.  The cereal is a mere five feet away.  Kenny will pull out the bowl, put it down on Opie's desk, take the spoon and the napkin, put it down, pour his cereal and his milk.  Here you go, GH. 
[00:17:00]  He's sliding in front of him like a father and a child, a young child.  He reminds me to eat.  If I haven't eaten by 535, he'll remind me that it's time to eat.  Now, will he stop if you told him to stop?  Like, I enjoy, I don't get a chance to enjoy Kenny much.  I love Kenny rocks.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you why this.  Fruit smoothie, anyone?  Oh, I know.  I love that.  But do you ever, will he stop if you say, look, Kenny, don't, I don't eat the Cheerios.  He panics.  Like, I really can get the Cheerios myself. 
[00:17:30]  Just make sure they're here.  If I do something different off this schedule, he completely panics because it's OCD kicking in and he thinks maybe he's doing something wrong.  It's like, no, Kenny, I can get my own coffee.  I know I look stupid here.  The reality is I got this figured out where I wake up at 445 and I'm at that desk between 5 and 505.  So by the time, like, the guys see me, I've been up literally 15 minutes.  And Kenny's been up well over an hour, hour and 15, so he's my brain for a while.  No, see, he'd lose his mind.  You're right.  You can't upset him like that or it'll be, you don't want me to do that, G.H.? 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  Kenny, Kenny, what did you do?  Kenny, look at me.  Stay in there, Kenny.  Kenny, Opie, isn't this thing based on your behavior?  Like, did you make this up or is this based on him just living with you and going, okay, this is what you're going to do, so I'm going to do it for you?  No, it's based on I can't get some things done in the morning.  And like I said, by the time I'm here, I'm only awake like 15 minutes, but now he's taking it. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, this is based on Opie's behavior taken to the umpteenth level.  Right.  Like, as long as the cereal was there and the bowls were there and the spoon, Opie's completely capable of getting up and making his own cereal.  Yeah.  It's five feet away, the fridge.  Yeah.  From his desk.  Yeah.  But Kenny now has gotten to this fatherly thing that he does.  And notice, where it'd be here, it's only paragraph two, but notice, my name has not appeared yet. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  You will end, and just watch how this whole thing goes.  Yeah, Bill and Waterford.  Because I might have to talk to Bob Eatman about how the billing is done for Kenny.  No, no, no.  No, that's coming from my side.  Trust me, it is.  Bill from Waterford.  I do pay him extra to help me out.  That is a fact, too.  I don't want people to think.  You've got to throw Kenny a bomb.  Yeah, I take care of him.  Bill and Waterford.  Hey, Opie, does Club Store to Kenny remember to put a maxi pad in that backpack, too?  Uh, Bird in Philly. 
[00:19:30]  If Opie is cranky, the rectal thermometer is in the front pocket of the backpack.  The backpack-y.  Oh, man, dude.  Make sure it's his mutant ninja, teenage mutant ninja turtles backpack, I stink.  Yeah, he's like a...  His favorite.  He's like a manny.  A manny?  When I have kids, Club Store to Kenny will be my manny.  Sean from FBA.  Hey, Opie, did Kenny make sure your permission slip was signed for tomorrow's trip? 
[00:20:00]  That's hilarious!  Opie, go to your time-out stool.  You're going to have to sit in the corner now for a time-out.  A manny.  To say, Todd, you've got to buy Opie those little shoes with the skates in the back.  You don't have to remove them.  He just...  He just...  Yeah, the skate pops out of the sole of the sneaker.  What do they call those things?  I forgot, man.  Wheelies.  Roller shoes, wheelies.  Wheelies or something.  Yeah, my nephew has them. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, that's hilarious.  I'm a two-year-old, and my wife doesn't leave me so many instructions.  Yeah, of course not.  All right, let's go to C.  C.  O-5-30.  Set up his breakfast on his desk.  Lay out blueberries, milk, cereal, bowl, and spoon.  When he is finished, rinse out the spoon and bowl and put it back in his backpack.  This is not a joke.  Uh-oh.  We're not writing crap for the radio show.  He does this. 
[00:21:00]  He does this.  When I was reading this, it didn't hit me until you're doing him.  Yeah, oh, this is the Kenny way, yeah.  This is a lot of instructions.  Like, you think this is a joke?  No.  No.  This is how he's got to do it every day.  Yeah.  He blinks six times before he wants his drink of water.  All right.  You ain't been watching it, Mike.  He blinks four times.  Get ready.  Yeah.  If you spill milk, whip your own back with the bullwhip I will supply for 15 minutes. 
[00:21:30]  This is inexcusable behavior, and only the spilling of your own blood can even come close to making up for this.  And then find Tom Hanks and tell him to find out who the real savior is.  Steven from Bayshore.  Rip the hair out of your scalp till blood runs down your face.  Steven from Bayshore.  Within six months, Kenny will be chewing Opie's Cheerios like a mama bird and regurgitating them directly into Opie's mouth. 
[00:22:00]  Spit them down his throat so he doesn't choke.  No, directly into G.H.'s mouth.  G.H.  G.H.  All right.  Well, D is short, 0540.  Ensure that intern gets Jim's coffee.  Starbucks 56th and 6th.  Well, this is his thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For him.  Wait.  No, the best part is that there's nothing about Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  There's stuff about Jim, and Jim's not even here.  That's what I was saying.  But is this – this is his regular – this is routine.  He forgot to take out to Jim, though, today.  Or this is for him when he reads it.  But, like, I better – does he read this to be able to follow his own thing?  Yeah, he couldn't leave out anything regardless if Jim wasn't here.  Or that –  I see what you're saying.  It would have screwed up the flow.  If we got fired and we didn't have a show to do, at 450, he'd still be ringing Opie's  bell, come on, G.H. 
[00:23:00]  With a backpack and everything, not have a place to go.  Somehow we'd have to figure out how to break the OCD cycle.  Yeah.  Hey, a lot of people call me a prima donna.  I mean, you guys are confusing this a little bit.  I mean, he's there to help us out and do things for us.  But he takes it to this level.  He takes it to this level.  And I'm not going to –  Because I do remember it at one point –  I'm not going to argue it when I'm half asleep.  I'm like, wow, this is great to have someone, like, doing some of these things as we prepare  for the show.  At one point, you did get your own stuff.  Yeah.  That was it.  For many, many years.  And then somehow it just transmuted into this whole thing, your own blueberries. 
[00:23:30]  I need to be the devil's advocate for anybody who thinks that – it's like, that's why  I asked, can you stop this?  Yeah.  Is there a way to actually put a stop to it?  I don't know.  And tell Kenny's stop.  I really don't know.  No, I can't.  I wouldn't want to stop it.  Let's get to 6 o'clock, then we'll take a break.  This is all the stuff before the show.  This is 545?  Yeah, 545.  Set up studio.  Chairs, stools in place, newspapers. 
[00:24:00]  Jim gets a post and a daily news.  Opie gets post, news, and news day.  Bottled water, two each for Opie and Jim.  Perfectly lined up, by the way, every morning.  And here's the first time my name even pops up, but it has nothing to do with me.  Yeah, 545.  You loser.  We're 45 minutes in, and my name pops up, but it isn't about me.  Anthony's sound effects.  Make sure my machine is plugged in. 
[00:24:30]  That's it.  And then I don't show up again for I don't know how many paragraphs.  Missed the sound effect.  Yeah.  Make sure his machine is taken care of.  Jim also needs a blank piece of paper, a pen, and some napkins or paper towels.  Get Eric or Than to help.  With what?  The papers and pencils?  Yeah.  Is that you need two people?  Yeah.  Anthony, do you need anything, Steve?  I am so self-sufficient.  That's why I said, nuclear holocaust, I'm good. 
[00:25:00]  Check.  He's a roach.  Check that bum's buttons.  Turn on the light switch and watch Anthony scurry under the refrigerator.  Later.  Don't forget at 5.55, tell Opie he's handsome.  All right.  I made that one up.  Reassure G.H.  He's a handsome man.  So that's...  Go coochie coo on his left breast.  We have to take a break. 
[00:25:30]  We're in the middle of...  Oh, we're only one hour in.  We're...  Yeah.  We're reading Kenny's instructions for Mike.  This is real.  This isn't made up.  We didn't write this for the show.  This psychotic big doof wrote this.  Kenny's panicking because he's away with Jim Norton down there in Houston because Norton's  playing the improv all weekend long and he wants Mike to follow these instructions.  We're up to the letter...  F.  Yeah, when we come back, we've got to do...  And be prepared for the misuse of a word over and over again. 
[00:26:00]  We do F through O and hopefully we'll get Club Soda Kenny on the show.  Yeah, to explain himself.  After the break, Patrice O'Neill sitting in for Jim Norton.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.

[00:28:30]  Send an intern for Jim's breakfast  Inquiry what he wants  All right  Inquiry what he wants  I believe it's inquire  Or make an inquiry  As to what he wants  But inquiry what he wants  Usually a small oatmeal from DNS Market 56  And blueberries from Ernst & Kline Market 
[00:29:00]  You have to go to two different places  Because he figured out where the good blueberries are  Where the good blueberries are  And where the good oatmeal is  Yeah  G  6-0-600 or 0-6-30  Wow  That's pretty bold of him  Yeah  Leaving a half an hour little gap  It is  Look at it  But during any time  During that period of time  Ask Opie  Ask if Opie wants more coffee 
[00:29:30]  Inquiry if Starbucks or CBS coffee  Inquiry  What adult  I haven't seen you do that yet there though, Mikey  Have you inquiried?  Actually, I just saw Opie come in  During that break  With his own coffee  I asked, he went and got his Opie  Did he ask?  Yeah  I know all eyes are on me today  This stuff usually happens  And most people don't realize  I'm like, screw that  I'm doing everything myself today 
[00:30:00]  My wife  The only one that  My wife just called me  I heard the message  I just let Aunt hear the message  And she said that  She'll never speak to me again  If I poured Opie's Cheerios  God bless your wife  For having your backbone  You better have dignity, Michael  And then at the end she goes  You never did that for me  Never did that for me  Alright, continue  Let's go  H  0700  Inquiry when Opie wants to eat 
[00:30:30]  Usually DNS market  Either small oatmeal  Egg whites on a toasted everything bagel  Egg whites in a platter  Or egg whites with turkey in a platter  Nothing else in the platters  In parentheses  Make sure  Or whatever those are called  What are those called?  What?  They're not parentheses, are they?  Oh yeah, I was getting confused  With quotation marks  Yeah  Nothing else in the platters 
[00:31:00]  Make sure that you get  Paper  Pepper  A pepper  Pepper and a fork  If applicable  If applicable  Get a fork  Do you realize how non-compatible  How much the fans of this show  Don't eat like Opie  Oh my goodness  I know  Because they don't have a Kenny  There's somebody  There's somebody right now  Listening to the show  Eating a steak and cheese sandwich  Right now  Yeah  For breakfast 
[00:31:30]  You know  Egg whites  Mixed with  Cheeseless cheese  With milk  Brought by a big stupid butler  That's pretty much  Where Kenny is  I'll try to defend myself a little bit  And bring it down to a serious level  For just a second  There's the heart thing in my family  And my dad had heart problems  His whole life  So when I saw him go through  His first quadruple bypass  About  Well it was  At 93  When the terrorists first  Tried to blow up  The World Trade Center there  I saw what he went through 
[00:32:00]  I changed my diet that day  Right  I used to do the fast food  And everything  And I still try to eat  A little crazy  But in general  I eat a lot better  Because I know it's in my family  And I saw what my dad went through  That's all  GH is really worried about his fans  Thinking he's a little pofter  Don't worry about it man  We know you're 47  And we know old Mr. Sicky over here  We know he wants to eat well too  I understand eating well  That's all  Because it does look really bad 
[00:32:30]  Oatmeal  Egg whites  I do have a reason though  9-11  9-11  9-11 came into his pool  9-11  No 93  It was 93  Let me tell you something  I said the first bombing  I know what you said  The first bombing  Remember that U-Haul truck  Or whatever  With a rider truck  Because you're right  I'm reading this going  Holy crap  He had to defend that  If Kenny doesn't bring me  Egg whites  The terrorists win  That's all I know  Someone wants to know

It's the day before vacation.  We try to keep it a little festive.  We got Drew Boogie.  He's mixing live in studio.  He's going to be mixing and scratching and spinning and doing all that fine stuff at the PNC Arts Center for our Travel the Virus show. 
[00:51:30]  The comedy event of 2006.  In between the comedians, he'll be on stage doing his thing.  I think he's going to kill at the PNC.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on O.B. and Anthony.com.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Got a bunch of mixes just for the show.  Yeah.  You threw together some good stuff.  Yeah.  I think the crowd's going to go crazy.  Yeah.  He's going to keep it.  He's got all the O.A. material. 
[00:52:00]  He's going to be mixing into his stuff.  Let's go to Cleveland and say hi to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Morning.  I'm a little nervous.  So beer with me.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Take a deep breath.  Yeah, Jerry, let me help you out.  Yeah.  We're on 22 radio stations.  Yes.  We're doing the whole XM thing.  So the XM fills in all the gaps.  And we're also heard in Canada.  I would say maybe a million people are listening to you right now. 
[00:52:30]  At any given moment.  So that's really no big deal.  So just relax.  And don't think of the million people listening.  And how you're perceived hinges on every word that comes out of your mouth.  Right.  All right, Jerry.  What do you got?  Make it smooth.  Okay.  Here it goes.  I was flipping through the channels last night.  And I came across Letterman.  And I remembered Fat Boy Slim was going to be on.  Well, prior to him being on, your friend Whoopi was on.  Whoopi.  And she mentioned your little incident on TV. 
[00:53:00]  But she didn't have the balls to mention your guys' names.  She has a woman.  You have to.  Well, she made that very clear last night.  And she totally bombed.  She wasn't even the first guest.  Some guy in his 80s that does sock puppets was out first.  Was there really a sock puppet guy?  Come on.  This guy, I swear to God, this guy was in his 80s.  If you could get the audio from last night, you've got to hear what she said. 
[00:53:30]  It was totally funny.  And it was funny that she was second to this 80-year-old guy that does sock puppets.  Jerry goes, if you guys got the audio.  Jerry, the only reason I took your phone call was to set up the Whoopi Goldberg audio.  Of course.  You see how it works?  Tearing down the fifth wall of radio.  Saw that you wanted to talk about it.  We have the audio.  We wanted to talk about it.  That's how it works.  You were being used. 
[00:54:00]  You were a simple tool.  Well, I'm glad because you guys rock.  You're the best radio show I've ever listened to.  Howard Stern could go die for all I care.  That's a little harsh.  You guys are the best.  All right.  Are you going to be at the Tower City Amphitheater in Cleveland?  Oh, hell yeah.  Tickets are on sale for that date as well.  September 23rd, the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  All right, Jerry.  We'll see you there.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Whoopi Goldberg was on Letterman last night. 
[00:54:30]  Mm-hmm.  Now, it seems to me like morning show personalities, radio show personalities, these days tend to  be men.  Yes.  Yes.  I am not.  No.  Have you had any, has there been any trouble because of that?  I mean, you're kind of invading a male club there.  Well, there are a lot of women there, but, you know, I met up with a couple of folks and  sort of just, we spoke and fixed it and it was all right.  There was trouble? 
[00:55:00]  What was the trouble?  Well, somebody said something wrong about me.  Now, let's start at the beginning.  Yeah.  Who was it that said something wrong?  I was two young men on the radio, two very nice guys, as it turns out.  And I felt that...  Do we know who these guys are?  Well, you probably do.  Yeah.  You know, they're very nice.  Yeah.  And they're white.  Uh-huh.  She's getting big laughs for dumb stuff.  You're just kind of hinting around things.  She doesn't want to...  She doesn't want to say our names on...  Spill the beans. 
[00:55:30]  ...on Letterman.  I think...  We'll say our own names on Letterman in two weeks.  Yeah.  We'll bring it up.  Two weeks from last night, we'll be on Letterman.  If he wants to talk about that situation, we'll mention Whoopi.  What the hell's the difference?  Yeah.  I bet Clear Channel, who she works for, probably got to her beforehand and goes, you know, if  they talk about the whole situation with Whoopi and Anthony, talk about it, but just don't  mention their names, because they don't need any more publicity.  And they just, you know, they were having fun at the expense of a brand new show. 
[00:56:00]  And so they have these followers who sort of made it a little bit difficult.  And so one of the boys said something he shouldn't have said, and I went to visit them.  Oh.  So you kind of called them out.  Well, I just felt like they were making so many invitations to me that I should meet  up with them.  When I...  You go, girl.  You go, girl.  Yeah, Whoopi.  This Whoopi thing. 
[00:56:30]  Do you want to tell the people, the folks who they were?  No, they're just nice boys.  That's the one that's nice boys.  See, everyone knows, even the audience knows, this became a national story.  For us.  Yeah.  Letterman knows.  Why wouldn't Letterman say it was Opie and Anthony?  Help us out.  We work for the same guy.  We're going to be on your show.  We're going to be on your show.  In two weeks.  Earth?  No, they're just nice boys.  They're just nice boys.  Nice boys with a radio show.  With a radio show. 
[00:57:00]  That's huge.  So what did you do?  How did you...  How did you...  You just showed up.  I showed up and I said, I heard you want to speak to me.  Mm-hmm.  And literally, they were like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got that right.  And you know that...  Look, my audience is not going to be anybody else's audience.  My audience is folks my age with my size pants.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  You know?  And they're kids and grandkids.  And it's a whole different groove.  And so I'm not invading anybody's space because this isn't being done. 
[00:57:30]  So that's what I'm doing.  Yeah.  So how was it once you...  How much time did you spend talking with them?  A good hour.  An hour.  I was on their show, actually.  And they were stunned.  Yeah.  They were stunned because...  And did they come around?  Did they apologize for saying bad things?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  What else could you do with me sitting there?  And didn't you make her apologize?  Yeah.  We got the tape.  Yeah, we made her apologize.  Whatever, man.  It has legs, the whoopee story. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  It only helps our radio show.  She's talking about it on Letterman.  Everyone knows what show she's talking about.  And there you have it.  That should end, this whoopee thing.  It's been going on for weeks now in the press.  Well, something tells me on the 31st it might come up again.  Yeah.  Wake up, whoopee.  Oh, God, that awful song.  Oh, it's not a horrible song.  Wake up, whoopee.  Yeah.  That's her little song.  Wake up, whoopee. 
[00:58:30]  That's it?  Yeah, this is what she plays every morning.  Wake up, whoopee.  Let me tell you, it will get stuck in your head.  Wake up, whoopee.  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Patrice was there when Goopee showed up.  Yeah, Patrice was there.  She came in the studio.  She surprised everybody.  And we didn't have anything.  And some of the listeners just don't get it.  We didn't have anything personal with her going on.  No.  It was not a personal thing going on. 
[00:59:00]  No, we just think her radio show stinks.  Yeah, we had deemed her show shite.  Right.  And when she was in studio, I did tell her that the show stinks.  Yeah.  And it's too bad she's not doing what she's good at.  Like, she was on Letterman, just kind of, you know, being fun and edgy and stuff.  She's trying to cater to these soccer mobs out there as they're driving their kids to school.  And I don't see it working.  Nice radio.  How much money are those people worth? 
[00:59:30]  Are those people even worth money that they have catering?  Why are we catering to those nobodies?  Yeah, what do you sell on those shows?  It makes me sick.  Metamucil and tampons.  Why do those people have to like you for you to have a career?  But, Patrice, the listeners are calling us out like, why didn't you beat her up when she was in your studio?  It wasn't about that.  I was there, and the vibe, like, listening may be different than being there.  But being, if you got, like, we were talking about, if you don't have anything really personal to her. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  It was just like, if we start talking about whatever's going on in this news now, it's like, like, the web junk thing.  Like, you just, you crack on somebody because you're there.  Because it's there and they're doing something silly.  And it's easy to do.  But it's like, what do you have against Whoopi, man?  She's an icon.  I couldn't think of anything to rip her on.  Like, yeah, your show is really lame.  She hasn't done a movie since 76 and she's still famous.  She's just famous.  You can't just go, hey, what's up? 
[01:00:30]  What's up with your dreadlocks, huh?  Yeah.  Hey, you.  And we like to continue to surprise our listeners.  They expected us to just beat the crap out of her.  But we thought, wow, this is pretty.  She's got balls.  She's walking into our freaking studio.  Yeah.  And we respected that.  And the list was like, what?  And the Letterman interview.  Why do you, what?  Sorry.  And the Letterman interview was, like, not personal.  She's just listening to these guys and we did just explain what happened. 
[01:01:00]  I wish you would have mentioned our names, but we'll do it ourselves in two weeks from last night.  Very excited about our Letterman appearance, August 31st.  All right.  Moving on.  Homeless radio.  We should get a couple of these clips in before we take another break and try to catch up a bit this morning, okay?  Patrice O'Neal, by the way, sitting in for Jim Norton.  And, well, real fast, let's go to Jeff in Houston.  That's where Jim Norton is.  Jeff, what's up?  Morning, O'Neal.  Hey.  Thanks.  I love you guys, man.  All right.  Hey.  I went and saw Jimmy last night and he killed, I'm telling you. 
[01:01:30]  Of course he killed.  Well, I know, man.  First time I ever saw him live.  And we sort of had a little moment in the bathroom.  You did?  Don't go that way, though.  Now, after I got done taking photographs and stuff, you know, I think a week before I went,  he hadn't popped in as I was leaving.  I chatted for a minute with him.  So he's real cool, though.  I was pretty cool seeing him live.  I'm glad you got to see him live, finally.  It's at the Improv in Houston all weekend long with Jim Norton.  All right, Jeff.  Thanks for the review.  Three shows tomorrow night. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Right on, bro.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  And, of course, Lucky Louie on HBO this Sunday night at 1030 with Jim Norton.  Right.  Homeless radio.  I honestly haven't heard this.  I went home early that day.  Didn't keep the radio on, so I have no idea what Tippy Tom did this time around.  I heard a little bit of it on the drive home.  Very good.  Handled by Than in his impeccable style.  For the new listeners, we got this Tippy Tom.  He's a complete mess, but he has a great personality. 
[01:02:30]  And it's a concept we thought about years ago.  You could get a monkey to do this radio job.  You could get a homeless guy to do this radio job.  We don't take ourselves seriously.  So we figured it would be really cool to just throw a homeless guy on the radio  and let him just do his own thing.  Yeah.  With, of course, Than helping out a little bit because you've got to get phone calls  and stuff on the air and keep the show moving a bit.  Mm-hmm.  And we call it Homeless Radio, and we got just a couple clips from Tippy Tom  doing Homeless Radio.  All right? 
[01:03:00]  Boom!  You're on, Tom.  Funny choice of music.  That smell.  My name is Tippy Tom.  And what I want to say is, hello, and how are you?  And I hope you're well, because I am in a funny place.  These guys look weird to me, but they seem okay. 
[01:03:30]  And, you know, I'll do the best I can here.  But the thing is, this is, I'm not sure what's going on here,  but Tippy Tom is on the air now, and I would like to hear some callers come in  and at least call and ask me a question, because I need a question.  Wake up with Whoopi.  There's Tippy Tom.  That's the intro to his radio show. 
[01:04:00]  I would listen to this all day, though.  All day, man.  God damn.  And I think next time we do this, we don't even have Than in studio.  Let him try to figure it out himself.  Wow.  That'd be rough.  Look at the, I think we do that next time.  He has to look at the screen and try to figure out what the people want to talk about.  That's what we do next time.  He's really, really homeless, too, this guy.  This guy is filthy.  He stinks up an entire room the second he walks into it.  He's got lice. 
[01:04:30]  He's got staples in his head.  Big chunks of hair.  The last accident he took.  Yeah, ripped out of his head.  Big beard that's just gnarled and nasty.  He looks like an aqualung.  Hey, that's good, actually.  And he's just completely out of his mind.  Yeah.  And no clue what's going on in the world.  He is the real-life aqualung.  Yeah.  That's it.  On the Jethro Tull cover.  Very good, eh?  That's him.  All right.  Homeless radio.  Well, Tippy Tom, talking about the liquid bombs on the planes. 
[01:05:00]  That's a very big story in the news lately.  You want to get a homeless point of view on that, don't you?  All right, Tom.  We've got another question.  Johnny.  Johnny from Long Island.  Go ahead, buddy.  All right.  My question is, I want to know what your thoughts are on terrorists trying to sneak on liquid bombs onto airplanes and trying to explode them.  I'm totally against warfare.  I don't like bombs.  I don't like any of that.  But did you hear about this most recent plot?  They're trying to get liquid bombs on and water bottles onto airplanes so they can blow them up. 
[01:05:30]  I think it's terrible.  And I'm totally against war at all.  And terrorism, I'm against it.  I don't like it.  Nobody does.  Out on a limb.  If I had my way, I would make sure I would terrorize those terrorists, and I'd blow their asses right off this earth where they belong.  You don't do that.  He's not very consistent.  He doesn't like war of any kind, but he'd blow up the terrorists. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  He continues with airport security.  I was going to ask you, how would you change the security going in and out of airports?  I'm afraid they're doing a good job now anyway because they're doing the best they can.  No.  You check.  I'm afraid.  We're not in Russia.  We probably should think more like Russians in Germany. 
[01:06:30]  And that way they're, yes, check everything before you go on that airplane.  I might have my children on that airplane and some terrorists up there blowing up.  Get the f*** out of here.  Is that from CNN or Fox?  Which pundit was that?  I think it was MSNBC.  Oh, it was?  Yeah, yeah.  And all the little words going down on there while he's talking.  Smelly Homeless Guy. 
[01:07:00]  Let's go to Smelly Homeless Guy.  What do you think?  I think you always take your clothes off, bitch.  I don't think this guy killed John Venet.  Let me tell you why.  He's in Thailand.  I know something about bricks.  And John Carr couldn't lift a brick up over his head. 
[01:07:30]  I like to see him cry.  He gets all angry.  Oh, my God.  Wake up.  We got what we were listening to.  All right.  One more here before we take a break.  Talks about his kids and that he's not a hobo.  You have kids, Tom?  Huh?  You have kids?  Yeah, I got three.  Michael, April, and Charlie.  And where are they right now?  They're in Reno, Nevada.  Do they know about your condition currently? 
[01:08:00]  No, I haven't talked to them in years.  My condition.  What kind of condition are you talking about?  Well, just like your...  My toothache?  No, like being a hobo.  They probably do.  But what do they do about it?  What do you mean a hobo?  That's not the right word.  I'm not a hobo.  What's the right word?  A bum. 
[01:08:30]  Okay, my bad.  I was out of line.  Stop being bloody correct.  There ain't even bums that...  I'm not a hobo.  I want to be called the right name.  A bum.  I'm a bum, not a hobo.  The applicant is a bum.  Call me a Latino American.  I'm a spit.  A hobo American.  Hobo.  Let me tell you.  Like he's walking the train tracks with a stick  and a little spotted bandana with his possessions in it tied to the end. 
[01:09:00]  You trying to condescend me?  I ain't a hobo.  I'm no home.  I'm a fan.  Call him a homeless American.  Yeah, a homeless American.  The art of the homeless.  Called you out, you phony.  I'm a bum.  I defy you to breathe in his presence.  Let me say something about John Carr.  I don't think he did it. 
[01:09:30]  I'm willing to come to the defense as a cag to witness.  I saw that faggot on TV.  He could have lift a brick above his head.  That little girl could have kicked his ass.  And why did he pull his pants up so high?  Is that how they dress in Thailand?  He wouldn't last a night on the street dressed like that. 
[01:10:00]  Creep.  You know what?  One more.  How about this subject?  The heat wave.  I can't get enough of homeless radio.  And I haven't heard this stuff yet.  Tippy Tom doing a radio show for us over at XM.  These are just the highlights, by the way.  What about the heat wave?  Which heat wave?  I've been through thousands of them.  Well, it's been really hot this summer.  How have you been coping?  How have you been dealing with it?  Well, I stay in air conditioning, so I didn't feel it too much.  But when I do go out, I stay in shade. 
[01:10:30]  And, well, I'd rather have it hot than cold.  No kidding.  Even in the summer, you don't get uncomfortable?  Well, I do.  But I can get cooled off.  I can get cooled off.  I just pour water on my head.  On my head.  Of course he wants to be warm.  He doesn't want to be cold.  He's homeless.  Someone's asking if Tippy Tom's a hobo sexual. 
[01:11:00]  Wake up, would you be?  God, that damn theme.  Oh, is it horrid.  All right.  We'll try to do more homeless radio later on the show.  He talks about 9-11, the morning after pill, football talk, Fidel Castro, evolution versus intelligent design.  Oh, that's great.  We might have to do this right after the break.  This is a genius.  Yeah.  He simplifies it. 
[01:11:30]  And in a way, it makes perfect sense.  Oh, yeah.  Music and Black Sabbath.  And then Tippy Tom signs off.  And every time he signs off, we're thinking that it's the last time we're going to hear from Tippy Tom.  No, he's a survivor.  Let's go to Eric in New York.  Eric, what's up?  Opie.  Yeah.  I want to congratulate you.  Why?  First impression that sounds good.  Oh, your first impression.  My first impression on the show.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Brother Joe. 
[01:12:00]  Brother Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to request a song, actually, that Tom recorded with Drew, I think.  Oh, the Gray Wolf thing?  Yeah, that thing kicks ass.  Oh, that's Gray Wolf.  That's about Tippy Tom.  Yeah, it was from Gray Wolf, but it's a song about Tippy Tom.  I don't think this side of the...  Is that about Tippy Tom?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a cool, very cool song.  Yeah.  I don't think this side of the Opie and Anthony show has heard this.  Yeah, Gray Wolf.  Another one of our homeless friends.  He has an amazing voice.  It brings moisture to your eyeballs. 
[01:12:30]  It's very touching.  It's just a homeless guy that sings a song about Tippy Tom.  And he...  It was just so well done, man.  Drew did a kick a job on it.  Yeah, because he just came into our studio and sang this almost a cappella.  He had like a guitar with him.  And then Drew just threw some background music to it and made it really sound cool.  And this is what's sad.  This is what's sad.  We really thought we had a hit on our hands.  The problem is the song's only, what, a minute long?  Yeah, it's very short. 
[01:13:00]  So we're like, oh my God, Drew, get Gray Wolf.  Bring him to a real studio.  Make this a little longer.  We'll release this.  And I think regular radio stations would play it.  Yeah, it was really good.  And how does it work out?  He couldn't do it.  He couldn't do it if he was in a studio.  He lost his voice.  Like that gravelly tone that he has that it works so well during the short version.  Yeah.  Just it overtook his voice.  So now it's...  It almost sounds like a Tom Waits tune.  Yeah, definitely. 
[01:13:30]  And Drew spent like a whole weekend, just could not get it done.  And we had to give up on getting Gray Wolf a hit.  He was a one-time wonder.  He was a one-time wonder, Drew's yelling from the background there.  That's usually the way it works, boys.  We got it, E-Rock.  He's trying to find it.  Oh, E-Rock's trying to find it.  Oh, E-Rock.  One moment wonder.  Drew's got it?  Drew's got it.  What's that?  Isn't it?  All right.  Thank you, Brother Joe.  Hi, Joe.  Snakes on a plane.  Talk to you, man.  All right, Brother Joe.  Snakes on a plane.  I think Drew's got it.  Wake up, we're whooping. 
[01:14:00]  You're not going to scratch through it.  You're going to just play the...  Okay.  Drew Boogie's got it.  So this is Gray Wolf, another homeless friend, singing a song.  Off the cuff, by the way, about Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got a break.  Thank you.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, yo.  This is a story about a man. 
[01:14:30]  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippi Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  He played that night.  And now he has nowhere to go.  Our money's gone and off for all my friends. 
[01:15:00]  And the cop says to me  Hey, you smell bad, get out of here  And he says, and you don't have an angel  And he says that angel  Shelter me from the falling rain  You have bones  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain 
[01:15:30]  Shelter me from the falling rain  You have bones  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  That's just a little piece  Hopi and Anthony are the latest shock jocks 
[01:16:00]  To hit it big  They are heavily into one thing  One of you, I don't know which one  Said then you can pull out your business  It's junk  We're artists  You present it as innocent  But I'm not so sure it is  Screw you  We're artists  Is there anything you won't do for ratings  We are publicity whorebags  Publicity sluts  We're artists  This is all about money  That's what it comes down to  It's your mercenaries  Aren't you mercenaries 
[01:16:30]  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead  We're artists  We're entertainers  We're not psychologists  We're not doctors  We're not daycare workers  We're artists  So it's all on appearance  None on you  None on us  We're artists  None on us  The O.B. and Anthony Show  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists  We're artists

[01:17:30]  Patrice O'Neill in studio today for Jim Norton,  who's at the Houston Improv all weekend long.  Right.  We were just talking about...  Snakes on a plane.  Snakes on a plane.  It's a snake on a plane.  Snakes on a plane.  We were saying he should just substitute all of his Pulp Fiction lines  and just put them in the movie.  Mmm.  Seems like that's what happened.  That's some tasty oatmeal.  Snake, you read the Bible, snake. 
[01:18:00]  This is some repugnant mother-evident.  Stop that hissing.  What are we going to do about the snake?  How are they going to pull this off like you guys are saying during the break?  How is this movie going to be pulled off?  I just want to know.  It's got so much hype, and everyone's like goofing on it before it comes out and talking about it.  I've been hearing about snakes on a plane since, what, like Thanksgiving?  Oh, man, it's been months.  It's been a really long time.  They've been hyping this movie for almost a year.  Nine months.  Apparently, as per E-Rock, they had to rewrite the film a lot because during, I guess, some 
[01:18:30]  of the quick screenings they've given people, they didn't like the fact that Sam Jackson  didn't use the amareffer enough, which is one of his, you know, everyone loves hearing  him use that phrase.  He's still in the Jedi mode.  He wasn't cursing enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still in his.  Ace Windu.  The Force.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, my chosen.  Ace Windu, whatever the hell his name was.  But they, yeah, they wanted more, him cursing more and more snakes, I guess.  There weren't enough. 
[01:19:00]  Not enough snakes on the plane.  You need a lot of snakes on the plane.  It's just one snake.  That sucks.  And how did he get on the plane with the snakes?  I don't know.  But I'm on a plane.  But I'm on a plane full of snakes.  They must not be liquid.  Snakes.  Snakes ain't liquid.  People are saying the movie's good, man.  RottenTomatoes.com is giving it 77% good rating. 
[01:19:30]  What does that mean?  RottenTomatoes is the best website for movie reviews because they take all the reviews  from all the papers all over America and then they give you a nice average.  Because your local guy might just be.  RottenTomatoes on the mother f***ing plane.  Because your local movie reviewer could just be a douche.  Yeah.  You know, so you get the balance of the entire country and then you can figure out a little  better if the movie's going to be all right.  I think they must have genius, they must have geniusly pimped.  Like, because it's almost like when somebody attacks you, you attack yourself to give it 
[01:20:00]  less fire.  Yeah.  I think they're making this movie purposely trying to, like, say, oh, this is goofy and  it's awful.  And they're like, okay, we're going to review it as a goofy, awful movie.  And for a goofy, awful movie, this is fantastic.  Did you ever see a sign on the plane that said, live snake storage, Jules?  Hey, uh...  Whoopi's on the plane!  I thought it was snakes, but it was a hair! 
[01:20:30]  Whoopi's mother f***ing hair's on a plane!  I thought we had snakes on a plane!  It's scaring the passengers!  It's just Whoopi's hair!  It's Whoopi's dreadlocks on a mother f***ing plane!  Damn, now we don't have a movie!  Hey, that snake bitch, are you okay?  Nah, I'm...  Nah, man.  I'm far from...

[01:36:00]  you can check it out for yourself that website again uh blank on a blank dot com something like  that or blanks on a blank blanks on a blank dot com all right uh there you go we should talk about  some of the current uh news items yeah what's going on it's a happy news day for once is it  kinda there's some funny stuff in the news  whoa whoa whoa whoa  i'm just laughing at it because there's never nothing funny in the news  never i'm just laughing at just a set up 
[01:36:30]  you don't laugh at this john carr guy i'm well yeah he's a he's a laugh riot but now they're saying  they they won't let him uh plead guilty to killing jean benet jean benet ramsey that's the guy john  carr i'm just with his pants up to his uh nips and his uh is tucked in uh outer blue freaking  collared shirt i was i didn't even embrace his name i just he's the dude the teacher that knew i  didn't even embrace his name as john the creep what a ghoul but he doesn't look like he can even 
[01:37:00]  lift his own fingers nah very weak to kiss she looked like she might have been able to take him  and fantastic we have to go here is i've never heard of it before where white people can say  they did something and people are trying to say it's a lie it's a lie it's a lie no i don't think  he didn't do actually you know it's a white guy and he he fits the profile the profile of guys that 
[01:37:30]  killed uh and sexually assault uh young children it's always a white middle-aged white guy uh you  know slender build they all look the same they got the same like lifestyle the same they grew up abused  it's the same thing it's rarely a black guy the country the country wants wants the the ramseys to  had did it so bad yeah that makes the better story and and like is let's say if somebody else  came out and uh and what's the guy threw his wife in the ocean with the damn uh oh uh scott peterson 
[01:38:00]  scott peterson or god forbid oj somebody actually comes out and none of those guys did it people  be like no no no they had to he's lying no first of all there ain't no way anyone's coming forward  in that oj case oh but john  scott peterson there's a possibility why couldn't you just go fishing on christmas eve  the guy might have just wanted to bring a fish home to his loving wife  she went out jogging or something i don't know she's pregnant jogging i don't know it's possible 
[01:38:30]  somebody else with the same fingerprints could have had their hand on that anvil could have happened  there's a john carr in a preschool  he just looks like he look he looks like he  ah he's guilty of something isn't he guilty of some things in thailand to begin with  well i i think that's it he was arrested there uh i haven't heard exactly what it what it was but 
[01:39:00]  it seems like the smart move that he might have made is what they're saying is uh to plead guilty to  this so he can get so he can get back here because over there yeah they don't like uh people over  there that do those things and then bring you back to life and then sell your organs that's what  they do over there they said they make sure your kidneys are good and they sell them sell them right  out you see them making the deal while you're dying like they just rip it out of you and you're  like is that my kid are you selling my kidney i'm still alive what are you typo no type oh and a 
[01:39:30]  half good enough take it away anybody need nipples how about a left butt cheek  here we have a left butt cheek come on  how about a lung we got a lung lung lung lung lung lung what do you need a lung  they're going  just ripping organs out of you just as they treat you like william wallace  take your face off yeah he better please he better say so he comes here and now they find 
[01:40:00]  out that he didn't do it what do they do do they send him back to thailand is there an extra  extradition uh no you can't be extra so he just gets to walk around and go i think he skipped out  on some charges though that's why he was over in thailand he skipped out on some earlier charges he  had here in the states i can't believe we're rationalizing that he might not have did it  they're starting to say that it's very suspicious so yeah you guys want to hear about him we got  some great audio his wife's got an alibi for him well listen to this yeah listen to this clip 
[01:40:30]  before causing a sensation in the grasp of thai authorities john mark carr was a father a husband  and a teacher with roots almost a world away in northwest alabama john was a uh a likable student  uh outgoing uh intelligent uh you couldn't help but like john uh he he had something going all the 
[01:41:00]  time marion county school superintendent brave l jackson remembers a boy raised by his grandparents  in the small town of hamilton who graduated and attended college in 1984 when carr was  19 according to the associated press he married a 13 year old local girl oops the marriage was  annulled the following year after the bride said she feared for her life and safety in 1989  car married a second time this time to a 16 year old in georgia what is that hair oh get away 
[01:41:30]  he is yeah oh he is a whack job get out of here yeah he uh he did not do this he did it i don't think  he did it i believe i think he's a pedo i think he's done awful horrible things but this one i think  he's fascinated with the crime um he wound up moving to uh the same town that poly class was uh murdered in 
[01:42:00]  after she was murdered he moved to that town and i kept a copy of her uh death certificate and he was  always he was trying to write books about uh adults and how they prey on children and he knew a lot about  the ramsey case but whether he had a connection with them or the uh ability to to kill her that's still  up in the air if this if this is his place he's a super genius super genius yeah he's a he's this is  genius to to be able to pull this one off yeah to think about pulling this one off well more audio 
[01:42:30]  here fired from many many schools 1996 the year john bonnet was murdered car came home as a substitute  teacher in elementary school but almost immediately there were problems complaints from parents that  uh rumors that were going on in the community and uh uh i could not find any any legal ramifications as 
[01:43:00]  far as any arrest had been had been made at that time with local authorities but uh we felt like it  was in our best interest that uh he not be allowed to substitute in our schools car was let go after  just three months two years later he lost another substituting job at another nearby school system  how'd he get another job undisclosed complaints jesus wow the hell did they get a job again after that  if there's any suspicion any inkling that you're doing these things teachers should be uh off the list 
[01:43:30]  of uh jobs now is he still married no she divorced him okay in divorce papers filed in 2001 his second  wife laura said her now ex-husband had been told that he was too affectionate with the children  yes but in spite of what he says cars ex-wife laura told san francisco television station kgo  her ex-husband couldn't have killed john bonnet ramsey because he was with her the entire christmas season 
[01:44:00]  of 1996 according to school officials car was substituting in franklin county alabama at the  time working up to december 18th a week before john bonnet was killed in her colorado home  and he returned to work when classes started in january ah the news is gonna look stupid  they are gonna look stupid uh let's go to uh who the heck who the heck what's up 
[01:44:30]  hey hey guys how you doing this morning all right black jimmy how are you  black jimmy the thing with this job is he wishes he'd done this job you know he wishes  and he's just putting himself in a place where he could have done it it's his fantasy  yeah it could be yeah those eyes going back and forth and stuff he's completely not right  said he loves her i love john bonnet it was an accident thank you by the way sally uh from oavirus.com  we found that bastard in bangkok among uh just updated uh 932 million people 10 years after the 
[01:45:00]  fact but we still can't find osama in an effing desert yeah finally uh this is what he was up to  in bangkok bangkok or my love let's see but laura carr also said john mark carr was fascinated with the  john bonnet murder researching it extensively according to kgo he was also reportedly interested 
[01:45:30]  in the murder of 12 year old poly class in petaluma california carr moved his family there in 2000  he lost another teaching job in 2001 after being charged with possessing child pornography  he pleaded not guilty  uh... no comment on that  by the time john mark carr was making his stunning public statements authorities say he had traveled  extensively on the run from the california charges for five years a resume posted to an online service 
[01:46:00]  for teachers paints carr as a globe-trotting educator it cannot be fully verified but it claims carr  recently taught young children in honduras costa rica germany the netherlands and south korea  before starting a new job this week teaching second grade in bangkok  oh my god that's like going to a strip club every day  oh i like how he says yeah i uh... like uh... killed john bonnet i was with her when she uh... died but it was an accident 
[01:46:30]  uh... what about the child pornography uh... on your computer hey no comment no comment hey  i won't comment on that  you're fessing up to the fact that uh... you killed a little girl but  uh... don't know what's on my hard drive  hmm all right what a ghoul  this guy just is uh... bad news anyway whether he did it or not 
[01:47:00]  well he did  whether he did this one or not come on  you're going to bangkok to teach the second grade  and like we said yesterday i think  what do you have to do in thailand to get arrested  yeah  can you imagine what you have to do  fess up to killing a young girl  apparently  then they'll arrest you  all i know is i saw a special on hbo about bangkok and  there were girls um... using a straw and darts  and uh... popping balloons 
[01:47:30]  around a stage  well it's very competitive  smoking cigarettes  yeah  yet being able to carry on a complete conversation at the same time if you catch my drift  well the clubs are very competitive in uh...  yeah  in thailand  doing the uh... the making fun of them chink eye finger thing  is that it  when you  if you pull your uh...  if you pull the corner of your eyes chinky style  corner of your eyes  they'll get angry and arrest you  all right  at least that's a reason  that's uh...  that's called a 402  40 
[01:48:00]  40  402  a bank  pulling your eyes  chink style  jesus patrice  they don't want to go with the black jokes  but you'll throw an asian under the bus in a second  hey look  hey look  nick in wisconsin  bangkok is  to pedophiles  what mecca is to muslims  yeah  jeez  hey uh...  we'll let that sit there  we gotta do  we gotta take another break  and finally catch up  we've been late all morning  when we get back  we'll uh...

[01:50:30]  Boogie doing that live in studio today.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America the last day before vacation.  Keeping it festive today.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's at the Improv in Houston.  All sorts of stuff going on.  Steve, plug OpieandAnthony.com. 
[01:51:00]  What do we got up there?  Oh, a bunch of stuff.  We have the article from the Herald, which just hit today, where they talk about the commercial.  We have the Radio and Records article, which hit last night, I believe.  That's the latest article on the show.  It's pretty good.  The shower rape video.  From the O.N.A. traveling virus.  The Opie and Anthony traveling virus, as well as the TV commercial.  You do have the TV commercial up there.  And also, don't forget, Kenny's instructions to Mike is up there.  That's right.  Kenny's instructions, his detailed instructions to Mike, are online right now. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  Speaking of the Opie and Anthony commercial, the Boston Herald wrote about it today.  That's pretty cool.  Yes.  What's up to everyone listening to us on WBCN?  CBS Radio Spot showcases Opie and Anthony's style.  CBS Radio is launching a new television spot, pushing the high-profile return of shock jocks,  Opie and Anthony, to terrestrial radio.  The new advertisement, which will likely begin airing today, today, that's cool,  on CBS affiliates in the markets Opie and Anthony appear in, is laden with the duo's style  of humor.  In the commercial, Opie and Anthony are dressed like sales clerks at a clothing store. 
[01:52:00]  A heavyset woman in a tight dress examines herself in a full-length mirror before asking,  does this dress make me look fat?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Opie responds, definitely not.  Anthony adds.  Uh, I forgot my line.  Line?  Line?  Line, please.  Line?  It's your?  Anthony adds.  It's your?  Um.  Um. 
[01:52:30]  It's your huge ass that makes you look fat.  The 30-second spot then cuts to the, they belong on the radio logo.  As we got into production, the whole idea of them looking like identical clerks was really  funny, because imagine if they hadn't got radio jobs, they would be like these miserable  clerks, said Greg Smith, chief creative officer for the Viagroup, the Portland main ad agency  that created the commercial for CBS radio.  Without radio, they'd be screwed.  Without them, radio would be screwed, he said. 
[01:53:00]  Ooh, what a paradox.  So the Opie and Anthony commercial getting a lot of attention, the Boston Herald writing  about it today, very, very cool.  The spot, yes, like Steve said, is up on opieandathony.com, and also it's on YouTube, if you search our  names, Opie and Anthony.  Everything's on YouTube.  I was just telling Patrice, have you seen your videos on YouTube?  And he said he doesn't go to YouTube.  How do you not go to YouTube?  You know when you did the bit for us, it's raining stuff, and they made that, like, video?  That's getting hit like crazy on YouTube.  Oh, is it really? 
[01:53:30]  Like crazy.  All right, we got Stalker Patty in studio.  Patty, can you stand up and go to the mic?  Patty.  We only have a few minutes left in the show, on this side of the show, then we'll do the  walk over to XM and continue before vacation.  Where is that creep?  Huh?  Where is that creep over there?  Move the camera.  Why don't you just turn around and see where she is?  I just rather look at her on Pal Talk.  Yeah, Anthony's moving the Pal Talk camera around going, where is the creep? 
[01:54:00]  It's like watching TV.  It's like she's not really there.  No human contact.  No, I just look at her on TV.  It's like a prison.  I just have a bunch of people up here and a security camera.  Yeah, I don't want to break the camera.  Oh, man.  Cellulite on the thighs.  Thanks for all the IMs, no filter, Paul.  Could you just knock it off?  Saggy boobs.  On the mess. 
[01:54:30]  Beach ball in the belly.  Oh, my God.  What is with those yogurty legs you got?  Yogurty.  You got to start wearing a smock.  Oh, my God.  She really should dress like a Muslim woman.  Yeah, just cover yourself up.  Hello.  Gravity is not being kind to you. 
[01:55:00]  Maybe you should leave this planet.  Because, like, everything is getting pulled down to this area right here.  I'm glad you should go to outer space.  Yeah, you need to go to, like, Mars is less gravity.  I need to take myself to the gym.  I'm not used to being my age.  Maybe for the next 50 years you should walk on your hands and everything will go back where it was.  Oh, my God.  Because you, uh, yeah, like, you saw E.T., right? 
[01:55:30]  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  I do not have an E.T.  Do you look at E.T. and go kind of, no, because E.T. was very hefty at the bottom, right?  Oh, she said, like, E.T.  You're kind of getting an E.T. thing going.  That's all.  I don't know.  I do like Reese's Pieces.  Oh, boy.  Hey, what about Starbucks, huh?  I saw the paper there.  It said Star Bugs.  They're talking about bugs and mice being in some of the Starbucks there.  Well, where are they? 
[01:56:00]  Well, you work there.  I'm asking you.  We don't have that problem in our store.  We have an exterminated that comes regularly.  There's bugs in the Starbucks.  Bugs in the coffee.  There's bugs.  All right, now, why do you want to do the news, Patty?  What makes you so special?  Yeah, she wanted to do this.  Real fast, Vanilla Gorilla from South Carolina.  She should wear a burker.  Burker.  Art from Boston.  Her breasts look like tube socks filled with wet, cold oatmeal. 
[01:56:30]  Can I get it for you?  Oh, man.  She is really sick.  Hot meal.  Hot.  What meal?  What meal?  You know, Patty's shaped like chewed up bubble gum.  All right, let's get into the news with stalker Patty.  She thought she'd be good for the show today, I guess.  Someone's suggesting Patty should be put behind a screen and only show her silhouette like the elephant man. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, keep laughing so you don't cry, Patty.  Oh, yeah.  Laughter hides the tears, Patty.  Yes.  Me.  God damn it.  I have a good sense of humor.  Yeah.  Do ya?  Oh, my God.  Did you just let this autistic woman...  What do you use for conditioner?  Acetone?  That is the driest hair.  Oh, my.  It's all so humid out.  It does a lot to you. 
[01:57:30]  Ah, shut up, chalk head.  So does gravity.  Chalk head.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, shall I begin?  I guess.  All right, old kindling head.  Hello, world.  I'm stalker Patty, and this is what's going on this morning.  Could be worse than Lewis Twitchell Santani as far as the intro goes.  I'm stalker Patty.  Oh, do you have to use your show name thing?  Can't you just say it's Patty? 
[01:58:00]  Come on there, pasta top.  Okay.  Ramen noodle head.  Get ready for your ramen noodle head.  Ramen noodle head.  Why don't you soften your hair up?  Soak it in boiling water for three minutes.  And then pour that packet on it.  Some chicken flavored head.  Okay.  Let me get through this.  All right, Patty.  Can we play some Rush as she does the news?  Yeah, I want to hear a little Rush in the background. 
[01:58:30]  Because she looks like Geddy Lee.  She does have Geddy Lee thing going.  All right, let's go, Patty.  Pop icon Britney Spears came out recently and stated publicly that her second child expected  to be born in the next two months was not planned.  It kind of happened, Spears said, followed by, it feels like I've been pregnant for 10  years.  Spears says that holding her first son, Sean Preston, is starting to get a little tiring 
[01:59:00]  due to her current shape.  Oh, my God.  And she will wait a bit longer for her next baby.  Oh, my God.  She's married to 28-year-old backup singer Kevin Federline.  Where's John Carr when you need him?  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That delivery is awful.  44 years too late.  It's nice.  That would have been nice.  You hear her sing-songy?  E-ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah.  What's that?  Britney Spears is pregnant again.  And they said that it must come up, because I, it wasn't planned. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, she's horrid.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Next item.  Former child star Haley Joel Osmond faces up to six months of jail time.  Quiet.  On charges of being drunk and possessing marijuana.  Shut up.  The charges.  Stop whining.  Of Osmond's car accident last month, which left him with a broken rib.  He's also being charged with driving with a blood alcohol level of over .05.  And being under 21, a vehicular code infraction. 
[02:00:00]  And Haley Joel is best known for his role in Sixth Sense.  And on Monday.  No one cared.  Patty, what do you think of that?  A little commentary.  That's the new thing on the news.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They should treat him like any other young offender, you know.  Young offender.  Being under 21, a vehicular code.  Any other juvenile delinquent.  Delinquents.  I don't know.  Sometimes they think they do that because they're bored. 
[02:00:30]  They have it all, so they want something more.  Hey, that's what I'm talking about, Patty.  Yeah, look at you.  Okay, then on Monday.  Nice segue.  Hold on, Patty.  Now go dip your head in some salt water with a little olive oil in it.  Patrice, did you see when she came in, what'd she throw in her hair that one day?  Baby oil.  She put baby oil in her hair.  It took like two weeks for her to get the baby oil out of her hair. 
[02:01:00]  She thought it would be a good idea, something you should do to your hair.  She looked like one of those ducks that get caught in the oil slick.  She washed it a bit.  She needed a green piece or something to rinse her off.  She needed green piece to clean her.  You're a mess.  Come on, Valdez head.  Okay.  People laugh really hard, so you feel like you're one of us.  Yeah, we're lying.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  On Monday, chocolate factory workers in Fountain Valley, California, 
[02:01:30]  discovered a column of chocolate drippings that bared a striking resemblance to the Virgin Mary.  Bodega Chocolates co-owner, Martucci Argentino, was quoted as saying,  I was raised to believe in the Virgin Mary, but this still gives me the chill.  Since the discovery, it was found under a bat.  Workers have been looking to the drippings for support.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Employees have been praying regularly, regularly praying to and placing rose petals around the figure.  I saw a hunk of shit that resembled the Virgin Patty.  I'm a few minutes early, but I couldn't resist.  You had to do it.  Oh, man.  If you would have just said poopy, they would have heard it.  I was in trouble with the heart and preserve it.  That was a legitimate screw-up. 
[02:02:30]  I forgot where I was.  When I turn around this way, all of a sudden I'm not on broadcast radio.  All right.  And this way, I know not to curse.  Oh, my goodness.  Last but not least.  What an idiot.  Sport that I am.  Just make me want to curse at you.  All right.  Read the last item there, breadcrumbs head.  Okay.  She's telling us that she's a good sport.  Nell Gibson, highly controversial.  Fire hazard head. 
[02:03:00]  He's pleaded no contest in the court of law.  Really?  Crouton hair?  He was pulled over by police while driving and found with a blood alcohol level of 0.12, 
[02:03:30]  which is 0.04 above the legal limit.  Of course, anti-Semitic statements allegedly followed.  Gibson was sentenced to three years of probation.  All right.  They put most people in jail.  I think you should do some.  No, they don't.  Maybe hang out with boy George and pick up garbage and drink.  It has true uncooked stuff in air. 
[02:04:00]  Well, have a wonderful rest of your day in life.  I'm Patty, and that's the news.  I'm on 42nd Street.  Old lo mein and duck sauce head.  Chinese noodle head.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Whatever, Patty.  Thanks.  How dry's her hair?  Nobody knows.  Patrice O'Neal did a great job for us today.  Thank you, Patrice.  How dry her hair?  Patrice O'Neal. 
[02:04:30]  How dry her hair?  We'll be at Caroline's.  Her hair?  Thursday, August 24th.  Friday, August 25th.  Then he does the PNC show with us on the 26th.  And then he does Caroline's Sunday, August 27th.  I hope you're following that.  Yeah, I'm there next weekend except for Saturday.  Except for Saturday because you're doing the ONA Traveling Virus at the PNC Arts Center.  Okay?  You got a website or anything you want to promote?  Yeah, patriceoneal.com.  Go to the V spot on VH1, the V spot on VH1.com, and keep me in the loop, I guess. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  We're out of here.  Guys, next time we see Eladia, we'll be on that stage at the PNC Arts Center.  That's right.  I hope you got your tickets for the O.P. and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  We can't promote it anymore.  So maybe the pest will help us while we're away on vacation for a week.  Presented by Bud Light, always worth it.  The tickets are available through Ticketmaster.com and all the info is on OpieAndAnthony.com.  And with that, Drew Boogie, get us out of here.  Come on. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Party Rock.  Party Rock.  Party Rock.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:06:00]  Are we on?  Is this us?  All right, we're outside Free FM in New York City. 
[02:06:30]  What?  We've got a very nice crowd out here today.  Why today?  I don't know.  Some days we walk out, there's no one here waiting for us.  Today it seems like a very nice crowd.  I just talked to some guy from Pittsburgh.  It's just the way it goes.  Yeah.  Sometimes people want to see us, sometimes people don't give a shit.  I see Big A is out here.  Big A.  Yes.  What are you doing out today?  What are you doing out? 
[02:07:00]  I'm doing walkover because it's Mike and Heather Day.  Mike and Heather Day.  I recognize my awkwardness in the street.  We didn't plug this on CBS or Free FM or whatever, but Mike and Heather, they had their first date at FH Riley's.  I know all about you guys.  Yeah.  And then they went off to Vegas to get married, what, like three, four months later, something like?  Six months later?  Yeah.  All right.  So they went off and got married in Vegas.  Now they're having the reception at FH Riley's, my bro's restaurant, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village. 
[02:07:30]  And so they came out to do the walk today.  It's Mike and Heather Day, right, Big A?  Yes, it's Mike and Heather Day Day.  Patrice loves Big A, man.  Absolutely.  And Big A, what are you doing at FH Riley's for the big reception?  I heard you're like Master of Ceremonies or something.  Master Poe is.  Master Poe is the.  Master Poe is the emcee, but will you be doing anything?  Videotaping? 
[02:08:00]  Just taking pictures and probably karaoke also.  A little karaoke?  Yeah.  I'm not as good as you, Anthony.  Well, no, no.  Not many people.  I could be.  But what do you sing karaoke?  All kinds of different songs.  Yeah?  Well, give us an example.  Melchilis songs.  Sing a little verse from something.  We had them sing Waiting on a Girl Like You from Foreigner.  Still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, waiting stars.  Spread, spread, spread, and then, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, news. 
[02:08:30]  We've got to play that when we get over to XM.  We haven't played that in a while, but when we first met Big A, we had them sing some songs  Waiting on a Girl Like You or whatever the name of the song is from Foreigner.  Waiting.  Hey, Patrice, check out the kick.  Oh, shit, nigga.  He's got a new kick, man.  Oh, that's right.  You were here when we had to buy Big A's new sneaks.  He had meatloaf shoes.  Remember?  They look like big meatloafs with laces.  The meatloafs.  Dude.  But what are those?  We took him to Nike Town.  He could have picked any pair of shoes in the joint, and he picks the up- 
[02:09:00]  There's snakes on his feet.  Snakes on his feet.  He's got snakes on the motherfucking feet.  What is it?  Are those Nikes?  Yeah.  Nikes, yeah.  They're slumbering, Big A.  That's the shit, baby.  See, Patrice is big in your shoes.  That's going to get you much closer to getting no pussy.  Like, he's 100% not getting pussy.  Now it gives him 50% closer to not getting pussy.  Snakes on his feet. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, it looks like two pythons ate his old shoes.  You know what it is?  It's his feet that make anything look like meatloafs.  So his other shoes were fine.  Looks like one of those, like, Amazon River pythons that ate a pig.  That's pimp shit.  That's Big A nose.  Big A nose.  He's pimping.  Yeah, look at that.  Definitely, yes.  That was a nice Big A, man.  I like that.  I would have gone with a different color size.  I know the whole khaki.  It's all right, though.  You've got to pick on something, right?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Just like a construction worker, a plumber, a gymnast. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  It would have been everything.  Very good.  So Big A will be at FH Riley's.  Mike and Heather will be there celebrating their wedding.  Sir, I'm doing a radio show, but at any time that...  Who are you?  What do you got?  It's a real beer collection.  Oh, my God.  Take off your hat, Ian.  I cannot wear a nasty helmet the whole way. 
[02:10:30]  That has fucking Hitler's...  Hitler's hair is in that motherfucker.  Hot meat, like 30...  Wait, wait, wait.  Your mic's crapping out.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  I hope you get World War II lice.  Oh, no, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I'll do the walk with my Nazi helmet on.  Where are you going?  This is the real thing?  That's the real deal, yeah.  I got it.  It swapped me, like, 30 years ago. 
[02:11:00]  Wow.  I got the guy's name in the helmet.  I got the guy's name in it.  I smell Cyclone B in it.  It's just a hat.  It's the matter.  It's just a hat, right?  Good for you.  Hey, let him walk your head.  I hope you get Third Reich itch, motherfucker, for wearing some strange Nazi hat.  Hey, Patrice, let him walk your head.  There's Nazi lice in the helmet.  Yeah, see, look.  It's brotherhood.  It's a brotherhood.  Wow.  You're crazy, man. 
[02:11:30]  You're crazy.  How you doing?  What's happening, baby?  How you doing?  Look at the cops are stopping going.  There's swastika on a helmet.  I know there's a little swastika on the side.  Come on.  It's not like a Mel Gibson or nothing.  Oh, my God.  Did he give you that hat?  Yeah.  That's fucking genius.  Wow, this I'll take home to my neighborhood.  They'll love it.  I'll put it on the mantle.  I'll put it on the mantle.  I'll put it on the mantle.  Do you got lampshades, too, you dick?  You what?  I actually had to use it as a helmet one day.  For what?  I was out with my friend the night before I left my helmet in his car, and I had to get 
[02:12:00]  to work.  The only way was to use that.  Well, that's fantastic.  Anthony.  Is anyone in New York even noticing or caring that I'm wearing a Nazi helmet?  That's the beauty of New York City.  Not one look.  No one really cares.  Not one look as you wear the Nazi helmet to XM.  How you doing?  Anthony, you've got to mow your lawn with that hat on.  Should I mow my lawn in my neighborhood?  Well, let me look at the reflection.  This is really...  Holy shit. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, is that awful?  No shit.  I'm going to bring him up.  Oh, is that horrible?  That's a married couple.  How you doing?  Guten Tag.  Wow, they're all just bothered.  All these people are bothered because we've got a big crowd today.  We're blocking the way if we walk.  We are the niggas.  Not one person has noticed that he's wearing that.  No, no one really...  It's New York, so... 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  No one really cares.  Isn't that amazing?  No one even looking.  No one is looking...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hey, Anthony, do this.  Hey, Anthony, wait.  Thank you, sir.  Give somebody the mic.  He's just walking away.  He gave you a World War II helmet and you're walking away.  Isn't that great?  Hey, listen.  Give somebody the mic, right?  And just walk without being...  Without everybody.  Just cross the street without everybody and see if anybody noticed you have a fucking  World War...  A Nazi hat on.  Yeah.  Just get...  Just cross the street, Anthony, and see if anybody... 
[02:13:30]  Because no one's looking because there's too many fucking people around.  Go this way.  Go that way.  Let Anthony go by himself first.  Just let him go by himself.  There he goes.  Let him go by himself, camera guy.  Okay, so the camera follows.  Well...  He has to walk by himself.  But everyone just looks down.  They don't notice crap in New York City.  He has a fucking Nazi helmet on.  One day we got to get something.  I got a chuckle out of an old guy who kind of looked like, what the fuck?  Because he almost called you...  Hey, what's happening? 
[02:14:00]  Remember you?  Hey, man.  Hey, one day we got to have someone just walk completely naked to see if these people notice  anything.  They'll notice naked.  You think they'll notice naked?  They'll notice naked, but not Nazi hat.  Oh, this lady notices Nazi hat.  Uh-oh.  She looks like Weezy Fall's daughter.  Oh, my God.  That is not right.  He's just walking across the street with a Nazi helmet on with, yes, the logo on the  side.  That needs to be covered up with a wow sticker or something, because that's not right. 
[02:14:30]  Get the Yankee emblem on that damn thing quick.  Oh, my God.  Put the Yankee emblem on...  I'm trying to find, like, Jewish people, because I figured they would probably be the most  offended.  All right.  Let's go to Pick-A-Bagel.  Let's go to Pick-A-Bagel.  We'll get some stairs in there.  Wouldn't that be weird if I ordered a bagel with a little schmear?  Oh, hey, hey, Anthony.  Bust up.  Bust up.  Hey, Anthony.  Hail a cab. 
[02:15:00]  Anthony.  Hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Wait a minute.  Go on.  Hey, Anthony.  Cat.  Anthony.  Hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Here, here's one coming.  Here's one coming right now.  Here's one.  All right, watch.  This is a photo op for everybody.  Hey, the guy stopped.  He kept going.  Shit, I got to hail a cab.  All right, get over there.  Right over there.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  No.  This is not right.  The cab has stopped.  Get in, get in, get in, get in.  Get in.  Ed, Ed, you got to get in one of these.  Where am I going?  Just freaking just go to half a block and give the guy five bucks.  All right.  All right, Anthony's going to hail a cab to the...  I got to hail a cab.  To XM.  I need a cab.  All right, we got cabs coming this way.  All right, here comes one.  Oh, he's turning.  Shit.  All right, get your cameras out. 
[02:16:00]  This is going to be a photo op, Anthony, hailing a cab.  To XM.  There's Anthony.  That's not right.  That is so not right.  No, you got to wait.  Oh, here's one.  Here's one.  Here it is.  Here it is.  And make sure you get in.  You got to get in.  You got to get in.  All right, get in.  Get in, Ed.  Get in.  All right, we'll see you, Anthony, at XM.  And he has hailed a cab with his Nazi helmet on. 
[02:16:30]  And there goes Anthony.  Take me to Berlin.  That's pretty fucking funny, man.  That is fucking hilarious.  Hail a cab was genius.  Hail a cab.  I know.  You came up with it.  Yeah, Steve.  That was my teeny, man.  You get the other one?  That was jumping in.  All right.  Wait till you see these pictures on opianthony.com.  Holy crap.  And you know Arabs are pulling over with that shit.  They're like, hell yeah.  One of the best walkovers ever. 
[02:17:00]  Anthony and I.  I see how they're hailing a cab.  That's not right.  Oh, shit.  Where is he?  Do they let him out or is he up the street?  How do they have this kid dressed?  Holy shit.  Wow, wow, wow.  All right.  Where is he?  He took that fucking cab.  Did they take him away?  I'm going to Berlin. 
[02:17:30]  I'm going to Berlin.  He's way up the sidewalk.  That helmet is genius.  That fucking guy gave him an official World War II helmet, man.  Yeah.  It's the real deal.  Where is that guy?  He left?  He left.  Yeah, he just took a left turn and left.  All right, Anthony's making his way back up the sidewalk here.  Anthony, genius.  That cab driver was laughing his ass off. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, man.  How awful.  A couple didn't want to pick me up.  I wonder why.  God damn.  Whose idea was that?  Steve.  That was Steve.  That was Steve.  You got to give credit where credit's due, man.  Hail a cab.  All right, listen.  We're going to go upstairs.  You want to give tours today?  Yeah, there's enough people.  They should have.  In honor of Mike and Heather celebrating their wedding?  Sure.  Why don't we do that? 
[02:18:30]  All right, you guys, stay outside.  We're going to get you.  We'll bring some people upstairs to check out the show, okay?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Woo!  I hope there's not many people at the elevator.  All right.  That was hilarious.  I got to wear it on the elevator.  That was really, really good.  All right.  You're welcome, man.  Is it still there?  Hang in, Tech Tam.  Patrice O'Neill.  All right.  See you later, bud.  We'll continue with us in just a few minutes.  The anemone show. 
[02:19:00]  Mexican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of DVD.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens all resistance.  Dude.  The enclosque of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes! 
[02:19:30]  There it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvidos.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bass.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, do it!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:00]  All right, all right, all right.  That was really funny.  We're going to get the video, the pictures up on opiananthony.com.  Yeah, got to see that.  ASAP.  Piling a cab.  Let's say hi to Randy in New York. 
[02:21:30]  Randy, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys were all Mr. Bit guys.  You should have had Patrice and Nazi Anthony compete to see who gets a cab first.  It would have been hilarious.  See if the black guy or the Nazi gets a cab first.  And it was funny as hell.  You guys rock later.  All right, thanks.  That's not a bad idea.  We might have to do that now that we have the Nazi helmet.  We're waiting for Patrice.  We'll ask him if he's game.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Pennsylvania.  Jeff?  Yo, what's up, guys? 
[02:22:00]  How are you?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I just want to let you guys know it was by far one of the best walkovers that I've  ever heard in my life.  That was great.  And that guy came out of nowhere.  That's what's great about the walkover.  You never know what's going to happen.  You never know who's going to walk up to you with something that you can use on the walkover.  That we can use, right?  That was great.  The visual that you guys painted was absolutely astounding.  So here, here.  Cheers to you guys.  Wait till you see the video and the pictures.  I cannot wait.  Man, we've had a great show today. 
[02:22:30]  We didn't think it could get any better.  And, man, that just took it to another level.  I've got to see it because, you know, being in the helmet and hiling the cab, I couldn't  really see.  But I'm sure it looked so ridiculous.  You looked really ridiculous.  And two cabs passed by.  They wouldn't stop.  They were laughing.  They were laughing.  And then, yeah, the cab that finally stopped and I got in, he was laughing.  Did he tip the guy?  Yeah.  Gave him a few bucks.  I took care of him.  I gave him some Reich marks. 
[02:23:00]  Some Reich marks.  I got to make the dumb observation again, though.  These New Yorkers don't notice.  Awful people.  They don't notice.  They really don't notice.  We walk with cameras every day and security and there's always some kind of crowd going  down the street.  Some kind of mess going on and they don't even notice what's going on.  Above it.  They're above it, New York people.  I'm above this.  Yeah.  I'm not interested.  I have to go do my thing.  Oh, my word.  There's a Nazi hailing a cab.  I'm busy.  I'm late for work.  I have my own helmets. 
[02:23:30]  I don't need that.  I don't need that.  A listener came up with an idea.  It's really up to you.  Go ahead.  And I understand if you say no.  Let me hear this.  Do you know what we're saying?  No.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  I don't have a clue.  They're suggesting that you and Anthony go back on the street and we see who gets a cab  first.  Who gets a cab first?  The Nazi or the black guy?  The black man or the Nazi?  Let's do that.  This is field research.  I'm all for field research.  You'll do it?  Wait a minute. 
[02:24:00]  Where will we stand?  How could it be set up?  We got to stand either side of the street.  Uh-huh.  Either side of the street.  Well, no.  How can we do this?  Because it has to be a choice between you and me.  A choice between you and me.  Right.  So.  You go.  You stand first.  Here we stand.  Right on 6th Avenue.  Wait.  I think you should stand first.  No.  I want to see if they pass up the black man to pick up the guy in the Nazi.  I stand first.  You do the see Kyle and I do the, uh, I do whatever. 
[02:24:30]  Nigga need a cab.  You get first dibs, though, on the cab.  So now the cab drives up, sees you first.  But if he passes you to pick up the Nazi.  And here's what I'm going to do.  I am going to really try to get a cab how I try to get a cab.  That, that please don't go by me because I'm black.  Like, I need a cab.  Right.  Face.  I'm not even going to go, give me a motherfucking snake's nigga and a cab.  It's a nigga and a cab. 
[02:25:00]  I'm going to be like, hey, I need to, I need to get to work face.  Oh, God.  Motherfucker.  Mate, my jewelry.  I got, I got my chains.  I'm going to pull my chains out.  Yep.  I'm going to be, I'm going to nigger it up.  Yep.  And you Nazi it up.  Nazi it up.  I'll Nazi it up.  I think people are taking bets at home.  Holy shit.  I'm ready.  Damn.  You ready to do that?  I'm fucking ready for that.  Right this second.  Feel research because I like to know this shitty town.  Well, we're going to have to mic you guys. 
[02:25:30]  This is a racist town.  And we should get a Jew.  We should get somebody with a, with a, with a yarmulke and just see who gets a goddamn cab.  All right.  We're doing this.  Let's say hi to Sarge in Baltimore.  What's up, Sarge?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  I made an, I made an observation today.  Or observation.  Hey, you know, stalker Patty.  You know what the hell I'm in.  Yeah.  You got to love that.  You know what the hell I'm in.  Shut the fuck up.  We all, we all know.  Look, stalker Patty sound way better than you reading the news today, cuz. 
[02:26:00]  You liked it?  I remember, yeah, I remember the last time you read the news, what you call it, E-R's, E-Nose?  Yeah.  And you got a hard time with those words, Jack.  But I enjoy the show.  Y'all some crazy white motherfuckers can treat you to bomb.  Baltimore love you, cuz.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Right on.  Yeah, I guess, I guess people enjoyed Patty today.  That's, uh, that's all right.  All right.  Cool.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Mike on Long Island.  Mike? 
[02:26:30]  Hey, how you guys doing?  Great, Mike.  This is some of the funniest shit I've heard in a long time.  I just wanted to ask the great Anthony, how did it feel striking that pose?  All night to natural.  Did you see that?  Striking that pose.  You know, finally able to do it in public was, uh, very freeing for me.  With a context.  Yeah.  You know?  With a context.  No more in my, no more in my basement by myself.  I wasn't hiding, worrying about neighbors or nothing.  It was, uh, very natural.  He didn't even think about it.  He threw that helmet on so fast. 
[02:27:00]  And you notice when Steve brought up the idea, hey, try to hail a cab using the Nazi salute.  I didn't bat an eye like, hey, maybe I shouldn't.  My hand went up before I even knew what I was doing.  I gotta see the pictures now.  I gotta see the pictures.  Oh my God.  You want to take a break and get back out there and, uh, try this experiment?  Yeah, let's see if we can do this.  We feel research, man.  Gotta do it.  Gotta do it.  Alright, go get those mics ready.  Let's see if everything's hooked up.  We're all set?  Let's get everything ready.  Make sure it's all ready.  He's, uh, he's setting up the, okay.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:27:30]  Presenting Opie and Anthony in-studio visitor guidelines.  Number 37.  Don't fuck the underage drunk guest.  Oh, mister, you're such a...  Oh, shh.  Not on the air.  Stay tuned for more pearls of wisdom from your pals at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Everyone left, so it looks like they, uh, they're gonna be outside for this.  Yeah.  We gonna do this?  Yeah, Patrice, I thought you were getting your gold on.  You're getting your bling on.  You just gotta pull it out from his, uh... 
[02:28:30]  Oh, you just have to pull it out?  His shirt.  Stupid white boy that I am.  Oh my God.  There it is.  Oh my God.  We're gonna attempt...  Oh, that was hidden?  Oh my God.  We're gonna attempt, uh, nigga versus Nazi.  The nigga Nazi cab challenge.  The nigga Nazi cab challenge 2006.  I will be, uh, putting on a, uh, Nazi helmet.  Yeah.  And trying to hail a cab with the Sigh Heil, uh, arm. 
[02:29:00]  Don't you got that other thing that the guy gave you yesterday from Pittsburgh?  What thing is that?  What was it?  The, uh...  Huh?  Oh, the...  The what?  It was like a...  It has...  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is like olive drab, isn't it?  Hmm.  I don't know.  No, I think you and just the helmet.  Just the helmet?  Yeah, that might save our jobs.  Because they'll say, look, he was just acting silly.  It's a helmet someone gave me.  It's silly.  It's silly.  And, uh, and I'll try to hail the cab. 
[02:29:30]  Patrice will be before me in traffic.  Right.  So the cab...  The cab will get first dibs at Patrice.  Yeah.  If he passes Patrice and picks up me, the Nazi, uh, then there's a problem.  And we want to do best, uh, best out of five?  Best out of five.  Or best out of seven.  I'd like to hide a better.  We'll see how it goes.  We could go NBA rules.  Want to go NBA?  NBA finals?  We'll see how it goes.  All right.  Oh, crap.  No, Dan.  Jesus Christ.  Will you hide that immediately?  What is wrong with you?  That is a giant flag with a swastika on it. 
[02:30:00]  You should tie that around your neck like a cape.  A cape.  Put it on me like a cape.  Let's see how it would look at least.  Anthony, you've got to tie that around your neck.  You know, I was thinking I might want to run for office at some point in my life, but...  No, you're not.  No, no, Ant can't do it.  Get sex with Sam wrecked that.  Because when we blow up our careers again, Anthony's going to go into the, uh, the professional  talk show world.  That's okay.  I'm going to...  He's going to be like the next Sean Hannity.  You watch.  But I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm going to do it. 
[02:30:30]  Or the next Bob Grant or something.  Or the next O'Reilly or something.  So this is fine.  It's purely acceptable.  All right.  In that genre.  Yeah, I don't know if I could wear the, um, the big flag as a...  No, the helmet's good enough, trust me.  Like a cape.  Okay.  You look so silly.  The caped juicator.  And you'll be doing the move, so you'll be all right.  Yeah, I'll be doing the move.  Yeah.  All right, want to do this?  Are we going to stand on the same side of the street?  Yeah, we got to be same side of the street.  You get the cab coming toward you first, though.  Because you got to be the guy that they pass up for me. 
[02:31:00]  Because everybody knows how hard it is for a black guy to get a cab in New York City.  Okay.  Because they always think you want to go uptown and, uh, jack them.  Oh, yeah.  We got to go on 6th Avenue, too.  We got to do it on 6th Avenue.  You want to do it on 6th?  I was thinking 57th, right there out in front.  Oh, um, no, 6th because, 6th because, um.  It's heading north.  Yeah, they think that I'm going uptown.  It's heading north.  They think you're going up.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Because going, I, I, I'm just telling you.  That might give Anthony an unfair advantage. 
[02:31:30]  I'm giving, the field, the field research I'm saying is that when I'm going down, when  I'm pointing down at a certain, at a certain, um, level in terms of, like, 60th and I'm  going down, they tend to pick me up because they think I'm not going.  I'm staying in Manhattan.  And then you tell the cabbie, you, you turn it, motherfucker.  And I go, I'm going to the Bronx, bitch.  You trick him.  You fucked up.  You trick him.  I'm just thinking if they see me on 6th over there, they might think, uh, I just work  at, like, Jekyll and Hyde's or something. 
[02:32:00]  Fucking Patrice probably.  They kind of have that kind of stuff over there, don't they?  Fucking Pat, I didn't, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I was just thinking, fucking Patrice probably puts, like, the Knicks jersey on, the Knicks  cap, heads like, makes it look like he's heading toward Madison Square Garden for  the big game.  Right in front of 34th Street.  I'm going to the Bronx, motherfucker.  With a big foam number one finger.  As soon as you get in, you're like, fuck that.  Fuck you, bitch.  I'm going to the Bronx.  So, people betting out there? 
[02:32:30]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, well, they're more paranoid than anything.  Yeah, people are scared.  They should wear the mustache.  Oh, the mustache.  All right.  Are we going to do this or what?  Let's go.  Yeah, I think we should.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  All right, Stan, take over the show.  It's an experiment.  I'll take it outside.  Okay.  Oh, Stan has taken over the show.  Yeah, just sit there uncomfortably for, like, a minute.  Sounds awesome.  Sounds awesome.  Take a couple phone calls, you know.  All right.  Cool. 
[02:33:00]  Bye.  Anthony and Patrice are leaving the studio with Ope.  They're wireless microphones.  Make sure I'm going to touch my sandwich, nigga.  And Patrice wants to make sure nobody touches his sandwich.  Stan, how you doing so far?  Oh, it's radio gold, Ope.  People are tuning away.  Can it talk the day before vacation?  Yeah.  Can it walk down to his mic?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'm on my watch.  I'm on my mic.  Yeah.  How's it going in there, Danny?  Yeah.  Nice with you.  Did you just use the talkback for Radioland out there? 
[02:33:30]  Radio, uh, Danny hit the button where he can only speak in my ear instead of talking  to everybody.  I can't because I have, my mic is on the ONA pod, so.  Oh, and then he just explained to me why that wouldn't work.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, let's, I guess some people are, um, concerned about what might happen.  Dave from Tennessee, what's up, man?  Hey, Dan, how are you doing?  Great.  I can't wait to hear you guys again in the fall of 08, because the only thing stronger 
[02:34:00]  than the Catholic League is the Anti-Defamation League.  Eh, well, Mel Gibson got away with it, sort of, more or less.  Good point.  Good point.  All right.  That's what I do.  I make good points.  Not necessarily funny, just sort of poignant.  Thanks, Dave.  Take care.  Later.  What's up, Drew?  How you doing, Than?  Welcome to, uh, Day Before Vacation Radio.  Yes.  How'd you feel about your set today?  I felt I could, uh, did a little bit better, but, you know, it was too much fun to be had  to be worrying about doing sets. 
[02:34:30]  Uh, you know, time was going by too fast.  I was enjoying the show.  Yeah?  You excited to wow everybody with your skills at the, uh, old PNC Center?  Yeah, well, I'll be playing mostly music, uh, but, you know, if, uh, people have requests,  I'll do a, you know, the little remix thing here or there.  Nice.  Um, Steve, do we have a status?  I guess they're probably still working their way down there.  I believe Opie's tinkling.  So they'll, they'll be downstairs pretty soon.  All right. 
[02:35:00]  I felt a little bad I had to come in here, because you were just sitting here by your lonesome,  just talking to nobody.  I don't mind.  No, I'm taking phone calls.  Um.  Is it a rating?  Let's, I, let's see.  Bobby from New York.  What do you got, buddy?  Bobby?  Yeah.  What's up?  Go ahead, man.  No, why don't we just send Sam down there, see how many cabs pass him out.  We'll find out what true color he is, black or white.  That's, uh, maybe we could do that another day.  The, the race test for Sam.  All right.  Thanks, Bobby.  Not a problem.  Um, can't. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  Yeah, these are, these are compelling phone calls we can go to here.  Hey, Opie, what are you doing up here?  Sorry, I just had to take a leak.  Now I'm finally leaving.  All right, thanks, man.  Okay.  It's a good thing this bitch really good that you're teasing, because nobody would be listening  to this otherwise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want my mic on.  I want my mic on.  He's complaining that he doesn't have his mic on.  Turn, Mike!  Oh, there it is.  There's Opie.  Now it's on.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Don't want everyone to think I'm a meanie. 
[02:36:00]  All right, we're out of the elevator.  And into the elevator he goes.  Yes.  That crackling noise is the mic not working in the elevator.  Fantastic.  Hey, I could use that.  All right, so I guess if you're just tuning in, that's what I'll do.  I'll explain what's going on.  They're doing the, what Patrice has dubbed, the Nigga Nazi Taxi Cab Challenge.  Oh, you've got to take a shit.  Yeah.  Your mic's on, Ope. 
[02:36:30]  And basically the gist is that, you want to take over, Ope?  No.  That was just me making sure my microphone works.  Oh, good.  That's why we're doing this live.  Where's Anthony?  I just saw a picture of us go by on the bus.  Oh, really?  They're going to be ripping those down soon.  Where are you, Ant?  I'm down right in front of the doorway.  I'm in the elevator.  Waiting for you to come down so you could observe, give a little play-by-play. 
[02:37:00]  I am out here with Patrice, who has turned his hat a little sideways.  He was practicing how he's going to hail the cab in the mirror in the elevator,  and in very intimidating fashion, it barely looks like he's doing anything.  It looks like he's going to rob the, oh, sorry, I'm distracted.  The guy is kicking us out of the doorway.  My God.  You'd think a Nazi could stand on a doorway of a building here in a free nation like the United States of America. 
[02:37:30]  So we're going to go?  Yeah, we're going to go.  You're going to have to be first.  And I'll probably be like right here.  So we're going to do it here or we're going to do it at 6th Ave?  I think we should just do it here.  Yeah.  See, there goes a cab.  There's a lot of cabs available, which is good.  But you should go down a little further.  And then we have to put our mics down, and Opio will describe the scene  because we don't want the cabs to think that this is some kind of ruse or something. 
[02:38:00]  Well, these people are going to wreck it.  They've got to stay up here.  Yeah, tell them to come this way.  Yeah, you guys stay up here, please.  All right, we're going down.  Yeah, we'll go down.  You go down by the corner a little bit, Patrice, and I'll stand kind of by the phone booth.  All right, we're setting this up.  What are we doing?  Best of seven?  Yeah, best of seven.  All right, best of seven.  Hold your mic down.  Anthony, if you're just holding it. 
[02:38:30]  What?  Just so I can get some kind of sound from you guys, just kind of have the mics held.  Yeah, you've got to be a little bit closer to me so he can see you.  He can't see you from there.  Yeah, oh, he'll see me, though.  He'll see me.  All right, I'm going to sit on the planter here.  Wait in.  Here comes a bus.  After the bus passes, game on.  And I think you need to be a little closer.  I think you need to be where the bus is after the bus passes.  Yeah, you've got to be closer to me.  Because the cab has to see both of you at the same time. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  And then make that decision.  Because it's almost weird close.  Closer, like with his fucking, like here.  No, not, well, then they're going to think that you're both together.  Yeah, yeah.  I like this distance.  I would never pick up a nigga and a Nazi.  All right, for you at home, these guys are like a bus length apart.  Yeah.  You've got Patrice all ghettoed out.  Patrice, you look downright scary.  All right, the second this thing goes by, now we've got to start. 
[02:39:30]  And Anthony with his Nazi helmet.  Game on.  As soon as that light turns green, game on, yes.  Stand like this.  All right.  Patrice has his arm up.  Ant, get your arm up.  Thank you, sir.  Hold on, hold on.  All right, there's a cab.  He's confused.  He's stopped.  He has passed.  He has passed?  Oh, Nazi.  Nazi.  Fucking Nazi.  Why didn't you pick up the African gentleman? 
[02:40:00]  You motherfucker.  I stopped.  You see me?  I stopped.  You didn't stop for a nigga.  You stopped to pick up the African gentleman.  But then you put, you see that I'm a Nazi?  You picked up a Nazi over a nigga?  I stopped.  I stopped.  And you see me stopping, right?  I stopped.  And I see maybe he's a Nazi.  You chose the Nazi, brother?  You chose Nazi over a nigga.  You chose the Nazi, brother?  Wow.  Come on, brother.  You don't pick up a fucking Nazi?  All right, Patrice. 
[02:40:30]  Come here.  Come here.  I've got to tell everyone what happened at home.  I'm the eyes of this thing.  So they're like a bus length apart.  Patrice, it's so obvious Patrice is hailing the cab.  The guy slows down, keeps looking at Patrice, not sure what to do.  He's thinking, well, I need a fare today.  Then he looks ahead and sees Anthony, and he speeds up and picks up Anthony.  Unbelievable.  One for Anthony.  One for me.  None for Patrice.  One for the Nazi.  All right, let's get back.  Bitch, niggas, will pick up a fucking Nazi in this street. 
[02:41:00]  One for the Nazi.  One for the Nazi.  All right.  All right, nigga, go and get a cab.  Let's see how this goes next.  Nazi one, shwuggy zero.  All right, here comes another cab.  Here comes another cab.  Start hailing at the same time, guys.  All right, here's the cab.  He's slowing down.  And he has picked up Patrice.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Talk to the brother.  I thought he was going to pass him.  I thought he was going to pass him.  Thanks for stopping, man.  Appreciate that.  Listen, there's a Nazi that needs a cab right there.  You're going to pick the no picking up. 
[02:41:30]  No picking up Nazis.  All right.  All right.  Two brothers, two.  We're tied.  We're tied.  Two black guys.  All right, we're tied.  Shwuggy one, Nazi one.  All right, best of seven.  Here comes another cab.  Oh, my God.  The cab sped by both of you all.  He didn't want either.  I had my mic up, too.  He had my mic up.  That might do it.  Hey, I need a cab.  He passed both of you.  This guy's turning.  Here we go.  All right, here comes another cab. 
[02:42:00]  You guys got to, like, hail the cab at the exact same time.  All right, their arms are up.  We got Patrice.  We got Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  That's two.  Damn it.  Two to one.  Two to one.  Damn it.  Two to one.  Hey, no.  Danny Glover.  This is because of Danny Glover.  This is all Danny Glover's fault.  Where's a Nazi supposed to get a cab?  All right, Swiggy two, Nazi one.  And you got to get a little closer.  You're a little too far away now.  A little further.  All right, here we go. 
[02:42:30]  All right, here we go.  Right there.  That's good.  Stand in the street, Anthony, like you really need it.  I'm going to be kind of like.  All right.  All right.  And when the light changes, we got a couple of cabs coming up.  Oh, here comes one.  All right, here comes one.  Let's see what happens.  And.  Oh, man.  Now it's a runaway.  Now.  Well.  Well.  The cab is kind of in the middle.  Ask the cabbie who he wants to pick up.  He doesn't know what to do.  Wait.  Wait.  Now he's pushing toward Anthony.  Who do you want to pick up, sir? 
[02:43:00]  Whoever comes in the personal.  Yeah.  I need the cab.  Is it.  Is it.  The nigger or the Nazi?  Whoever comes personal.  Whoever comes.  You kind of hedged your bet.  Nah, he.  Let me tell you something.  This gentleman hedged his bet and pulled right between both of us.  What is that?  A tie?  And then he kind of pushed toward Anthony.  I don't know.  It's.  Patrice has two, right?  I got one.  I say.  And that's a tie.  I don't know.  He started.  He started pushing past Patrice.  He really did slowly start passing Patrice. 
[02:43:30]  Well, you might have to give it to the Nazi.  Two.  If I'm.  If I'm the official judge.  I think it's two.  Yeah.  And my helpers here are saying thumbs up to the Nazi.  He made an excuse that he was like.  Whichever.  He was ready to pick up Patrice.  Then he saw you.  Then he hedged his bet.  But then he started inching toward you because I think he didn't want to get in trouble.  This is the tiebreaker, right?  We're going to seven, though.  Best of seven.  We got two for the Shwoogie and two for the Nazi.  All right.  All right.  We're waiting for the next cab.  Outside XM.  Satellite radio. 
[02:44:00]  This guy.  You're trying to figure out what's going on?  You figured it out finally?  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's another cab.  I don't think.  He's got people.  He's got people.  Oh, he's got people in there.  All right.  We're waiting two for the Shwoogie, two for the Nazi.  Patrice is loving this.  And you've got to be a little more aggressive because.  You've got to be aggressive.  And you've got to.  Anthony, move closer a little bit.  There you go.  Right about there.  And get in the street a bit.  There you go.  This is definitely fair. 
[02:44:30]  You've got to be trying to get the cab, Anthony.  He is.  He is.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  All right.  Wait for the bus to pass.  Wait for the bus.  Game off.  Alvita, Zane.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  Two cabs have passed you by to pick up the Nazi.  Danny Glover's going to be pissed if I win this.  Where's Danny Glover from this bitch?  All right.  Hold on.  We're waiting for the bus to pass.  Hold on. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  There it goes.  Hold on.  Let this cab go by because they're letting people out.  Yeah, they're letting people out.  We've got to keep this fair.  Let them go.  Let them go.  All right, Anthony.  Get back in the street.  All right.  Game back on.  Game on.  Will the cabbie pick up a shruby or a Nazi?  Put my mic down.  All right.  We're waiting for a cab.  Don't see nothing.  The light's red. 
[02:45:30]  When it turns green, we'll get a few people, a few cabs driving.  Yeah.  I cannot believe it's two up.  It is two up.  God damn, another bus turning over here.  You better not be stopping.  Oh, I'm trying to catch a cab.  I'm just trying to catch a cab, sir.  It's a little tough.  Hey, what the hell is this guy doing?  All right.  Hold on with the bus.  Get this bus out of here.  You're ruining our bit.  They're letting people off.  All right.  That's all right.  God damn public transportation. 
[02:46:00]  That's all right.  We're killing time anyway.  That's good.  If you're just tuning in, we're trying to see if a cab will stop for a shwuggie or a  Nazi.  You are very threatened by Patrice.  You look a little threatening like that.  You put your game face on, man.  You like, you start grabbing yourself.  Hey, Patrice.  Monster house on the side of this bus.  I was just telling you about the movie during the break.  Go see that shit.  It's a little 3D action.  It's not bad.  All right.  After this bus passes, we'll get back to the game.  The bus driver is shaking her head at me. 
[02:46:30]  How you doing?  Well, find out.  Find out.  Why is she shaking her head?  How you doing?  Excuse me, ma'am.  Is there a problem?  You don't appreciate it?  No, she doesn't.  She's not happy.  Arviva Zane.  She's not happy what she just saw.  No.  All right.  Game on.  Here comes the cab.  Here it comes.  Put the mics down.  Go in.  Start hailing.  All right.  Cabby's coming up.  Cabby's coming up.  He's speed.  Another one that's kind of in the middle.  Patrice, what do you think? 
[02:47:00]  Patrice, what do you think?  He was going.  He got me.  He wanted me.  He was going.  Oh, he wanted me.  He was going.  And then he thought the...  He was going.  He was fucking taking a Nazi.  Totally taking the...  He looked like a Nazi.  Do you see him?  Wait, I'm going to the judges.  Nazi or Swoogie?  Nazi?  That was so Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  I'm going to pull this out.  I'm going to pull this out with niggas.  Wow.  You better pull this out.  All right.  You better pull this out, man. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, what a comeback.  Fuck.  Wow.  What a comeback the Rike is making.  Patrice just saw a girl with huge tits, and now he doesn't know where he is.  Patrice.  Niggas, stay in the game.  I'm pulling it.  Stay in the game.  I'm pulling a Jesse Owens on you, motherfucker.  You better.  All right.  Hold on.  As soon as this bus passes, game back on.  It is three for the Nazi, two for the Swoogie.  What a comeback the Nazis are making.  No.  Ant needs one more, and he takes out the Swoogie.  I need one more cab, and the Nazis will win. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Here comes the cab.  Get in there, Ant.  My money's on Ant.  Cab is making the left onto 57th Street.  Here he goes.  He is.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Thanks, man.  We're going to game seven.  It's good.  It's going right to game seven.  All right.  Hold on.  Don't hear it yet.  I am in the street.  Hold on.  Let's set this up.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:48:30]  Get in the street.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Jesse.  Wait.  Don't hail this one yet.  Hold on.  Let's set it up.  So here we go.  The Swoogie's got three.  The Nazis got three.  Wait.  Wait.  Ready?  Okay.  Ready?  Game on the line.  Okay.  You stand there.  Yeah.  I'm going to come out and wave it before you.  We're going to catch you.  You're going to already be waving, and I'm going to run up, and I'm going to wave to get right  ahead of you.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Well, maybe you guys should start from this doorway and go to your spot. 
[02:49:00]  And then go run.  We run to the spot.  That's exactly it.  Run to the spot at the same time.  We come here, and then.  Okay.  All right.  You go over there where you were.  I go where I was.  Absolutely.  We both.  As we're both hailing.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And.  Okay.  Yeah.  You go straight this way.  Yeah.  Make sure it's less than a bustling.  Okay.  Plenty of cabs.  Plenty of cabs.  Okay.  See that one right here?  You say go, Obi.  You say go.  Right there.  See him?  All right.  Hold on.  See that cab?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  When that light turns green.  And he's right up front.  Wait, man.  So we get a green light like a drag race.  Yeah, it's like a drag race.  When that light turns green, game on. 
[02:49:30]  Game on.  Game on.  Schwiggy versus the Nazi.  It's 3-3.  Who gets a cab?  Which is bad for Patrice, because that means three of them passed you by.  For a Nazi.  A Nazi.  So you.  A fucking Nazi got a big cab.  Who gets passed up?  The people that were enslaved for so many years, or the people that killed six million Jews?  You've already lost, man.  You've already lost.  All right.  What about this cab turning?  You may have a point.  As soon as that light turns green.  Light turns green.  Game on.  Game on.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  Oh, you got to put the mics down.  Yeah, mics down when the light turns green.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam, get this.  This is for the title right here.  Here it is.  Lights turning green any second now.  And then we'll step out.  And.  And give our.  Go.  Game on.  Wait till he moves a little.  Wait till he moves.  Ah, shit.  He's turning.  Oh, he just.  No, he just grabbed somebody.  Oh, he did.  And a shruggy at that, by the way.  All right.  Good.  I'm due.  All right.  Right behind.  Right behind that cab. 
[02:50:30]  As soon as he takes off.  Can't be two cabs in a row picking up black people.  Oh, yeah.  That would be.  It's got to be a Nazi sympathizer driving one of these.  That's like the dealer getting three tins.  Go.  Go.  Game on.  Go.  Nazi versus the shruggy.  The cab.  Oh, man.  I'm a Nazi.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for picking up a Nazi before an African-American.  Oh, Patrice.  Did you realize that, sir?  I didn't know that. 
[02:51:00]  You didn't know that?  You didn't see him with the gold chains and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Gold chain or silver chain.  Did you notice I'm wearing a German Nazi war helmet and I gave you the Nazi salute as  a hail?  Did you see me first?  Oh, and there he goes.  Did you see me first?  Ask him.  Ask him.  Ask him.  I need a motherfucking cab.  The Nazis win.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that not right?  Patrice, that is not right. 
[02:51:30]  Wow.  So, wait.  What happened?  What did the guy say?  This motherfucker.  He said he didn't see Patrice.  Patrice came bolting out.  He didn't see a 500-pound nigga with jewelry on.  Right.  And a mic.  And a mic.  He didn't see it.  These guys have been influenced, by the way, because what I noticed every time, they're  stopping sort of in the middle like they're confused and then they inch up toward the  Nazi.  Just to get past you.  Just in case. 
[02:52:00]  Unbelievable.  There is a problem in this city.  You motherfucker.  I thought Danny Glover was full of shit.  The third right gets a cab?  The third right gets a cab before a black guy.  Are you fucking serious?  This city is fucked up.  Are you fucking serious?  Best out of seven.  That was amazing.  Oh, shit.  I was so low in that.  Good job.  I was sure you were going to win it.  That's ridiculous.  You pulled away.  I had a comeback.  The fucking third right pulled away. 
[02:52:30]  And it's good because with the seventh one, we did it completely even where we both came  out at the same time, gave our little salutes and hails, and he came right to me.  Right to the Nazis.  Oh, my God.  That's got to hurt.  The injustice.  That's fucking despicable shit.  Did you see that?  Did you fucking see that?  Despicable.  Holy shit.  All right.  Let's give it back to Than.  We'll be back upstairs in a few minutes.  All right.  Lucky everybody. 
[02:53:00]  I'm back.  And Danny can't talk.  But, Drew, did you get to peek your head out and see some of the festivities out there?  Yes, I did.  And the cab really did go past Patrice on the last one while they ran out to get him.  You know, while they ran out to get the cab.  That was fantastic.  The funny thing for me was that I'm up here on the fifth floor, and Patrice is down there  laughing and screaming, and I can hear him from up here.  You know, his voice is echoing off the buildings.  Well, you know, it doesn't matter to many people. 
[02:53:30]  It matters to me.  Oh, all right.  And now Danny has switched his mic on.  Yes, I did.  And we can all partake in the goodness that is Danny's voice.  Danny, how did you enjoy a nigga Nazi cab challenge?  I enjoyed it very much.  I kind of knew this was going to happen, to tell you the truth.  You thought the Nazis were going to win, huh?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I've had, believe it or not, I've had problems getting cabs, because I'm not  like the whitest guy on the face of the earth.  You are swarthy.  Yeah, I get mistaken for Spanish all the time, so even I have trouble getting cabs in the 
[02:54:00]  city.  I wanted to see them switch positions.  I wanted to see, you know, Anthony be first before Patrice, just to see if they, you know,  because they seemed like they were just picking up the first guy that had his hand out,  so I'm not sure.  But didn't Patrice have his hand out first?  Yeah, because he was first in line.  Anthony was after him, so I wanted to see if Anthony was first in line, if they would  just keep going to Anthony first.  Ah, and never pass up a Nazi.  Do you have something to add, Travis?  No, I just want to listen.  Oh, okay. 
[02:54:30]  Travis not adding, as always.  Why would I?  Yeah.  I liked hearing the cabbies scramble as they realized, it's kind of like that dateline  moment where they realized they had just gotten busted.  Oh, Patrice just sent the black people back after yelling at that last cabbie.  What'd he say?  He was yelling, I don't remember offhand, something like, you know, you won't pick up a black guy,  but you pick up a Nazis.  Really, really screaming at the guy.  It was great.  And the boys have returned.  Yes.  Enjoy.  Unbelievable.  Oh, that video's got to go up. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  That video has to go up, because that was some of the most despicable injustice you will  see.  Oh, my God.  Was that funny?  Nazi.  Every cabbie had a move.  Like, he tried to stop right in between the two, but then he kept inching forward toward  Anthony.  Yeah, even the ones that were stopping for Patrice were like, eh, do I stop?  Do I roll forward to the Nazi?  I really thought he was stopping.  I thought you won. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, I thought you were just going to sweep it.  The last second he went past you.  I thought the first one was a fluke, and then after you got two more in a row, I thought,  okay, now it's just going to be a sweep.  Right.  But no.  No.  Just horrid cab drivers.  And then we had a couple that didn't, that kind of stopped for me, and then he drove  away, and I looked in, and he looked like a U-boat commander, that guy, that pulled right up  to me, and then pulled away when I shoved the mic in there.  That guy was a U-boat commander.  Das Boot.  Oh, wow. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, wow.  Why don't we take a break, and hey, we're educating people.  Isn't that amazing?  Feel research, man.  Feel research.  Yeah.  This was not a challenge of Nazis and niggas.  This was a challenge of society.  And society lost.  Society lost.  We're going to digest, and we'll continue.  That was amazing.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, God.  Is that Rammstein?  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  The unmistakable sound of Rammstein.  Because of the Nazi victory out on the street?  Damn it.  Yeah, we'd have played some hip-hop or something if you wanted.  Did you have Mama said knock you out of there?  Queued up.  Sons of bitches.  Oh, my God.  The injustice.  That was a lot of fun.  Let's say hi to Keith in Louisiana.  Keith, what's up?  Boys, that was great.  But my big question is, Opie, I don't know if you noticed, but who was working the pad  data?  Because they had a football game. 
[02:57:30]  The score was great.  And then Nazis win.  Oh, was Danny doing the pad data?  Oh, you were quickly updating the score and everything?  Oh, that's great.  Nice.  See, that's what it's there for.  Very good, Danny.  Very nice.  You get an award.  Can I ask you what you wrote as the teams?  Oh, he was Nazis versus Patrice.  He wouldn't commit.  He didn't commit.  You've got to understand, it was not me.  No.  This was a social study. 
[02:58:00]  It was.  What do you think?  Field research.  What do you think?  I goose-step around in Nazi regalia all day?  I have to leave the house at some point.  All right.  Right on.  Listen out.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Mark in Buffalo.  Mark, what's up?  Not much.  Yeah, it was a fair test because every time you guys talked to a cab driver, he was not  white or he wasn't black, so it was a fair test.  No, it was a couple of black ones.  A couple of them.  I don't know if they were African.  Yeah, yeah.  They want American black.  I think they were like Caribbean or something.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Probably the only city that would have worked in, right?  Oh, in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  I wouldn't want to get a cab.  Would you pick me up?  You wouldn't help me if I was having a heart attack, motherfucker.  Your accent keeps you from helping me.  You wouldn't help me if you...  Excuse me, sir.  Can you help me?  I just can't because I talk like this, nigga.  I can't.  Sorry.  Just the rules.  It's again the law.  Again the law.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  Tim.  Hey, I wanted to defend the cab drivers. 
[02:59:00]  When was the last time a cab driver was gunned down in the Bronx by a member of the Third  Reich?  That's true.  With one of those funny-looking pistols?  That's quite a while ago.  A cab was killed by a V2 rocket this morning.  Jerry in New Mexico.  Jerry.  A panzer tank blew up a livery cab vehicle.  Jerry.  You realize the same thing would have happened had it been 1943, right?  Is that disgusting?  What?  No.  Back then. 
[02:59:30]  I wanted to have three.  No.  And they'd have ran you over to get to me.  It would have been a clean sweep.  They would have stopped and said, nigga, lift this cab up and bring me right over to  him.  You brought me over to that?  Let's go to Jimmy.  I would have been in the cab in 1943.  Jimmy.  Just my back.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I didn't think that I would give you half a show.  I just wanted to give you the helmet.  Yeah, this is the guy.  Oh, yeah.  I got to give you the helmet.  Thanks, man.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  And I'll tell you, your lucky Club Soda Kenny wasn't here today.  Because the way you kind of ran up excitedly, Kenny is a little overzealous sometimes.  You probably would have been dead on the street.  No, I had thought about that.  I was going to go to him first.  Oh, that's very good.  And see if it was okay.  That's good.  I've been listening to you guys since the second day you were on NAW.  Big fan.  Thank you, sir.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Do you have tickets to the Opie and Anthony traveling virus?  I wish I did.  I'm leaving for Denver that day. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, okay.  I was going to give you a pair of tickets.  Maybe he can make the other one.  Is he going to be around Philly?  Can he make the Philly show?  Yeah, I probably could.  When's that?  September what?  I've only been saying it every day.  September 9th?  No, I won't be back until the 12th.  All right.  Well, then go screw.  I'm glad I could give you some show, though.  We're trying to give you tickets, damn it.  All right.  We'll give you something when you return.  Give us a call back.  Thanks for the helmet.  Thank you.  Let's go to George.  Take that home with me.  In Chicago.  George?  The Nazis win! 
[03:01:00]  The Nazis win!  Down goes Swoogie!  Down!  Down goes Swoogie!  Down goes Swoogie!  That's great.  Down goes Swoogie!  That cab driver is stabbing for the Swoogie, I think.  Oh, wait.  He's not?  He's rolling toward the Nazi?  Oh, sorry.  My mistake.  He is picking up the Nazi.  A spectacular move!  By the Nazi!  Back goes Griffey looking up, and it's out of here!  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall. 
[03:01:30]  My mistake.  That's what it was.  The cab starts slowing down in front of a tree.  Oh, he's got it!  No!  Oh, wait a minute!  He's picking up the Nazi!  Motherfuckers was really stopping, and then go...  I thought I was going to blow away with it.  I really did.  I thought I was going to get four in a row, and I was like, hey, look, people just...  I thought that was a fluke.  With all the pressure, with all the fucking social pressure for them to pick me up, they  rode up to not fuck a Nazi!  A nigga in a metal war helmet! 
[03:02:00]  Right.  Like, fuck the little small insignia.  This motherfucker had a metal war helmet on his head.  It could have had happy faces painted on it.  It's still ridiculous to pull up to a mental patient with an iron helmet.  A black man is in competition with crazy folks.  With crazy iron helmet guy.  And lunch.  And this motherfucker...  If he's...  Hmm, should I eat?  Or should I pick a nigga up?  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Let's go to Greg in Oregon. 
[03:02:30]  Greg?  Yeah, I think Patrice was at a big disadvantage, because, you know, Anthony can always take  off the helmet, but Patrice can never take off the black.  Wow.  See?  What?  See?  Social...  I saw that.  I saw that.  Social commentary.  Come on.  I saw that coming.  Of course you did.  Maybe I should have worn a helmet.  Yeah, you wear the helmet.  You guys are all confused.  I don't mind picking up a Nazi, but Jesus Christ.  Hey, let's say hi to Rob and Christine from Long Island.  Rob, Christine. 
[03:03:00]  Hello.  What's up?  Why are you guys calling?  We're on the phone together.  Okay.  Yeah.  No, I called up yesterday, and Anthony, in his own words, called me pussy with, because  I hung up quick.  Yeah.  At the end of the show.  But yet, see, I'm the type of caller that when I know the phone call's going bad, I try  to punch out as soon as possible.  You certainly did, but we wanted to give you tickets.  I didn't know that.  My friend Nick calls me up right after.  He's like, bro, we're going to be giving you free tickets.  You know?  I got to get the show, but I couldn't get back through.  All right.  The deal is, you guys are getting married August 26th, so you can't go to the PNC show, 
[03:03:30]  right?  No, we can.  Our reception ends at 5 o'clock.  We can make it.  Well, we're actually going to go in our tuxedo, and she's going to go in her wedding dress.  Wow.  I think the show, when does the show start down there?  5, 6?  Oh, 7?  You sure you can make it?  Mm-hmm.  We'll probably be a little bit late, because we'll be coming from Great Nick.  Oh, crap.  You're going to be a lot late.  Why don't you just go to the Philly show?  Because we're going to be on our honeymoon.  Oh, you are? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I'll give you a pair of tickets.  If you make it, you make it.  If you don't, what can I tell you?  Well, why don't you come back from northern New Jersey a couple of days earlier and go  to the Philly show?  White trash.  We are going to Aruba?  Yeah, really.  The Poconos will always be there.  I mean...  That heart-shaped bathtub will always be there.  Don't you worry.  And that vibrating chair.  Big champagne glass hot tub. 
[03:04:30]  Come on, man.  HBO 1 and 2.  It'll be there forever.  HBO 1 and 2.  And 2 here.  Nothing but the best for my sweetheart.  Thank you very much.  All right.  You guys want tickets?  Sure.  Hold on the line.  It's Rob and Christine.  They're getting married soon.  Congrats, I guess.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on the line there.  Let's go to Rich in Bayside.  Rich?  Yeah.  I don't know what Patrice is mad about. 
[03:05:00]  What if you would have done the study at 11 o'clock at night?  I'm seeing 7-0.  7-0, you think?  At 11 o'clock at night?  At night?  Absolutely.  You know, where we were, where we were standing, I might be able to compete at any time of  the day.  Because it's one of those ones that it's like, oh, because, you know, you got a profile.  And at this block where we were at, the fact that it was even close is disgusting.  I'm disgusted.  But the fact is that 11 at night where we were would still be the same kind of outcome  because it's not a, trust me, I've been trying to get cabs in this town. 
[03:05:30]  I'm a comic and I didn't drive a lot for my whole life.  So trying to get a cab, I'm a master at it.  You're really good at it, right?  You got to stand certain places.  Here I can get a cab.  But if I had to really catch a fucking cab, I would have to walk.  I can't go on 10th Ave and catch a cab.  I can catch a cab on 9th Ave and 7th Ave.  I can catch a cab on down avenues and I can catch a cab going east, not west. 
[03:06:00]  No.  Because I'm not, they go, hmm, he's not going to Spanish Harlem.  He's not going to the Bronx because the Bronx is, oh, I got to get over to the George.  Okay, I'll pick this nigga up.  But, but the east, east, I can go east and, and downtown.  Downtown and east, I can get a cab.  I can get a cab.  Boring.  Yeah, that's true.  But, I'm just saying, I'm trying to let you know, this is field research, old.  This is field research.  What are you going to have for lunch?  Tuna sandwich. 
[03:06:30]  I'm trying to give the science.  Social commentary.  I'm trying to give the science on how to catch a fucking cab as a nigga.  But evidently Nazis don't need a fucking science.  Now they stopped for me.  We just wanted to get a big laugh at your expense.  Who cares about the research?  Exactly.  Well, next time you carry a gun, a gun with a knife on the top of it.  Yeah.  Bayonet.  I can't really discuss the rest of it until we crunch the numbers tonight and really get  this research down.  I'm going to have a volume of books out on this. 
[03:07:00]  Why don't we talk about Sue Johansson before we leave today?  Sue Johansson.  That name sounds familiar.  I believe it's the grandma.  Yeah.  Sex Advice.  From Canada.  Canada.  Very good.  She's an old lady.  How old?  She's old.  Old, old.  And she talks about sex.  She's got to be.  And gives people sex advice.  Mid-70s.  In pretty graphic detail for an old broad.  Yeah.  And it's, I find it disturbing and a bit disgusting that some old broad is really just getting 
[03:07:30]  really deep and dirty into people having sex.  That's rude.  She's talking about blowjobs once and it was just, you need a lot of spit.  A lot.  With this old lady voice.  A lot of lube.  A lot of lube and spit along the foot.  Yeah.  She talks like that.  And a lot of lube.  And just lube up the cock.  Like those male hormones kick in.  Would you know?  She's been through menopause.  Yeah.  She's like in her 70s.  What?  Would I want?  Just to find out what it was like.  Hell no.  No way. 
[03:08:00]  Oh.  No way.  You know what I'm thinking?  Oof.  We got to get Steve to put that whole mess together and the Shogi Nazi thing and play  it at the PNC.  Yeah.  At least the final cab.  Yeah.  Coming up.  Yeah.  A little bit of that.  Sure.  That would be a lot of people.  That should make the highlight real.  A lot of people need to see that video.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  So it's Sue Johansson.  She talks to a caller here who gets hard from girls farting.  Oh, wow.  What?  What? 
[03:08:30]  Huh?  Yeah.  Here it is.  Welcome back to Talk Sex.  We have Jay on the line.  You hear her?  Her teeth are barely in there.  Welcome back to Talk Sex.  Oh.  Welcome back to Talk Sex.  We have Jay on the line.  Hi, Jay.  Hi.  How are you doing, Sue?  I like your call.  Got a question. 
[03:09:00]  He didn't say anything.  My question is, is this normal for a man who likes women to fart and it gets, and it arrives  when it gets hard?  Yeah.  Now, what kind of farts are we talking about?  Regular farts.  Anal farts or vaginal farts?  Anal farts.  Why are you turning it off?  I'm pulling my shit out right now.  I want to jerk over somebody's airy butt.  I was getting into it.  God damn it.  We stopped to comment.  Anal farts.  We can't let it go by that our grandma's talking about anal farts. 
[03:09:30]  She asked a pertinent question, which airy hole do you like it to come out of?  Do you want to hear this from your own grandma, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a little rough.  Somebody's grandma.  Regular farts.  Regular farts.  Anal farts or vaginal farts?  Anal farts.  Are you sure?  Yes.  No.  You're sure?  I'm sure.  I don't know how you could be sure.  I am sure.  All right.  Okay. 
[03:10:00]  Okay.  Because they smell?  No, I guess the sound.  You're down there?  No.  I don't have sex in the, you know, in the, and, you know, in the rectum.  I have sex in the vagina, but it just, when it happens, then I get hard.  Okay.  Well, is it a problem?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know too many people that's like that.  Some people feel that that's normal.  It's sexy to them, but I don't know.  Well, you know, again, I don't like to say what's normal. 
[03:10:30]  Because what's normal for you may be, you know, just off the wall for somebody else.  If you get turned on by anal farts, then, and if your partner is able to produce, you  know, a big blast of hot air on a regular basis, then by all means, if it turns you on, if it  works for you.  I need some pussy out of this show.  Why are we worried about it?  It's harmless.  Well, it's harmless, but it's not at all sexy. 
[03:11:00]  It is.  It depends on what girl.  A girl farting during the day?  A beautiful woman doing anything despicable is just, you fucking a 10, and she fucking  farts.  It's just something dirty and sexy about it.  You're 69ing with her, and all of a sudden, just right in your nose.  Oh, and you just go.  Direct line to your schnoz.  Oh, you just go, you funky bitch.  And then you just kiss her.  She just goes, tiki, tiki, tiki.  Oh, you fun.  You like to fart, huh?  Come here.  Catch it in your mouth and blow it back in her face. 
[03:11:30]  Which is called a CPR, by the way.  If it isn't, it is now.  If your girl farts in your mouth and you go up and kiss her, the CPR.  The CPR.  I like it.  I gave the bitch the CPR.  Let's say hi to the lady trucker.  Lady trucker, what are you hauling today?  I am hauling, I forgot.  How'd you forget?  I do a whole bunch of stuff every day.  Oh, I got that washing machine. 
[03:12:00]  Washing machine.  Ah, washing machine.  Going from Michigan down to Mexico.  What?  Don't they send them washing machines to Mexico?  So basically what you're doing is driving Mexicans.  You're just giving them a lift back home.  You're being redundant.  Say you're driving Mexicans back home.  Okay, I'm driving the pochos back home.  That's hysterical.  This is going to be a mechanized society and they're all going to be over here.  Washing machines. 
[03:12:30]  Washing machines.  You would think that's the last thing they need in Mexico.  They don't need washing machines.  What are they washing?  Next thing, yeah, dishwashers.  They're all experts at it.  Call them housing.  Holy shit.  A rock and a river is all they need.  All right, what do you got?  What do you got, lady trucker?  I've got a mando topless for you.  Yeah.  The art of traffic hailing.  Sweatering, chains, legging, squirky versus helmet hailing Italian stallion Nazi.  Italian? 
[03:13:00]  Could you...  Oh, you.  Are you driving right now?  Yes, sir.  Is there a bridge abutment coming up anywhere in the next mile or so?  Yeah, I got one in about a ten mile.  Could you just hit the gas and steer right into it?  How fast are you going, lady trucker?  Oh, 65 miles an hour.  We want to do another experiment.  Yeah.  Jam on the brakes right now, live on the show.  And cut the wheel to one side.  Yeah.  You ever jackknife? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  What was that like?  Pretty rough?  Yeah, well, actually, that was on a training pad.  Oh.  And going down the interstate at 65 miles an hour, it started again, and I was able to control it.  But, yeah, that's scary.  Oh, scudder.  Hey, lady trucker.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Lady trucker.  What do you think of the gas prices, and how much does it cost you to fill up that rig?  Oh, I don't care. 
[03:14:00]  Okay, it's funny even when I see it coming.  It's just funny, because she's still, right now,  Ah, you know, and it takes like, oh, a thousand to fill up my, hello?  You'll start hearing that weird.  Phone off the hook sound.  I was, please hang up and dial again, motherfuckers.  I tuned into a trucking show on XM, I don't remember who, and they were doing that exact 
[03:14:30]  bit.  I'm like, that's interesting after the first phone call, until the first phone call is  done.  And then after that, it's like, who cares?  Who cares?  All right, here's the advice Sue Johansson gives the farting guy.  Good.  It's perfectly harmless.  Make sure she eats lots of Brussels sprouts.  Sometimes, you know, when I do it with a gut, it makes me feel degrading.  But that's what turns me on.  If you explain that to her, would she feel degraded? 
[03:15:00]  If she really understood, if you said it beforehand, you know what, honey?  There's something that really turns me on.  I know it doesn't work for a lot of people, but for me, it really works.  I love it when you fart.  I mean, there are a lot of women who could say, oh, oh, oh, let's go, big guy.  As she's walking out the door.  Can I do that one?  Yeah, I mean, that's kind of, I don't know.  I don't mean, you know, some may say that's nasty.  Some say that's just like a woman told me, belching and farting is normal. 
[03:15:30]  But, you know.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  You know, but I don't know how I feel about that.  You know, sometimes I feel that way, but it makes me hard.  Well, you know what?  You've got to work through why you feel aversion to it, why you don't like it,  why you feel that it's wrong.  And then from there, you can stop and relax and enjoy.  If your partner can do it and produce enough gas, then just relax and enjoy. 
[03:16:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, John, where are we going for our first date?  Nick, Shayla Bean, baby.  Shayla Bean in a lactose intolerant village.  Hold on, hold on.  Milk shack, baby.  Hold on, let's do this right.  Hold on.  You get ready over there.  Yeah.  This is why we get the big bucks.  What's happening, baby?  How you doing?  Are you ready? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So stupid.  I love that we get to go back to third grade.  All right.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, you can.  It's not.  It ain't working, motherfucker.  What's your name?  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Let's try this again.  All right.  Would you eat baby razor blades? 
[03:17:00]  We do a bit. 
[03:17:30]  And, Danny, you got to get this bit going again.  Is he going to get some?  Oh, no.  You're just throwing some food out.  All right.  It's called Guess the Sound.  So we play it like this.  And then you got to guess what it is.  We all know now.  You want to guess what this is?  I hear drums in the back.  Is that some type of tribal thing? 
[03:18:00]  No, you'd think it was drums.  There is some hitting going on.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  Yahoo.  Coming?  The guy coming?  Yahoo.  Oh, yeah, he's coming.  This was one of the most disturbing videos.  He's getting off, though.  Yeah.  What was he doing?  You'll never get it.  What are we waiting for him to guess it? 
[03:18:30]  Patrice, you need to do this one on WebJunk 20.  Yeah, that's it.  They'll play this.  What is it?  Some kind of live song in his asshole?  The guy has what could be the biggest butt plug ever shoved up his ass.  But it's not shoved up enough.  That's not enough.  His ball sack hangs so low that he's rocking back and forth.  And his nuts are going clear between his legs, hitting the butt plug, and like a hammer, smacking it deeper into his ass. 
[03:19:00]  Like a bangus.  His own fucking balls are swinging, and he's like rocking.  So that tribal drum you hear is his own ball sack.  Is his balls hitting the back of the butt plugs, smacking it into his asshole.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Yahoo, he said.  Yahoo.  We're getting the video for you, Patrice.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if I want to see this shit.  Oh, no, you want to.  Bring this to the gang at WebJug 20.  Yeah, WebJug 20.  Why wouldn't they play something like this?  Would you do it at the gang and go, guys, I found this video. 
[03:20:00]  I think we could get this on WebJug 20.  And then you could say something like, and this crazy motherfucker is shoving a butt plug up his ass with his balls.  Is that his balls?  Yeah, those are his balls.  Look at, look at.  He is banging a butt plug up his ass with his own sagging Turkish taffy balls.  This is nuts.  He's got a great technique if you really think about it.  When the fuck did he find out he can do that? 
[03:20:30]  There you go.  Why wouldn't WebJug 20 play that?  Yeah.  Maybe you pixelate.  Well, we just have to, like, black out the butt plug, and I think we can show just the tip of the balls.  Just enough of his balls hitting the butt plug.  I want to talk to him about that.  I want to talk to his standards and practices.  And we might have to cut out the gyration. 
[03:21:00]  I think we can keep the balls and the plug.  Just the movement.  But the yee-haw is funny, and you've got to finish with that.  See where they say no.  Yeah.  See how far you can go with it.  Let's go to Dee Dee.  She's live from Washington, D.C.  Dee Dee.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Dee Dee.  Hi, Dee Dee.  I'm listening to you between my traffic reports.  You're listening?  Yeah.  And the farting thing, I don't get.  Yeah.  That's pretty gross, huh?  Yes, it is.  Even for me, that's gross.  You ever hear of things called a Dutch oven? 
[03:21:30]  Where a guy holds his chick's head under the blanket in bed and farts and holds her in there,  and they call it a Dutch oven.  That's gross.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why do you guys do that?  Well, I don't.  I've just heard about it.  Well, some guys do.  Some guys find it very funny.  Some girls find it funny.  You're not into any of the farting.  What about queefing?  Pussy farts?  What about snorting? 
[03:22:00]  How about the cement mixer?  What's the cement mixer again?  How about the cement mixer?  I come on your hair and then slam your head through the wall.  Hell no.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I don't like it.  Holy shit.  No, I'll give you a better one, home.  Those are queefs.  Hey, I'm going to be in New York in a couple of weeks. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah?  You'll have to stop by.  Stop by and say hi.  Yeah, stop by and do the news or something.  Yeah, I heard Patty Stalker doing it.  Is that, um...  Patty Stalker.  No, this is Dee Dee.  Hi.  Dee Dee Dee.  She likes when the UPS man comes over, and she bangs him.  Yeah, she's had sex with a UPS man, and she used to be so drunk, she'd black out.  I'd black out, and I got married in Vegas.  She'd do things that she doesn't know what she was doing.  No, she would end up in different cities.  Pretty.  And have no idea. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  But not anymore.  No, no.  She once woke up.  She was married to an English guy that was a counterfeiter.  You ever do the scuba diver?  What's the scuba diver, Patrice?  When you're sitting in the bathtub, and your dick is hard, and it's poking out the water,  and she's sucking your balls.  The scuba diver.  I thought that was called snake in the toilet. 
[03:23:30]  Snake in the toilet.  There's a snake in the toilet.  Motherfucking snake in the motherfucking toilet.  No, I've never done the scuba diver.  No.  She's checking.  All right, Dee Dee.  Anything else?  So you don't like the farting thing?  No.  It's gross.  What's the crazy thing you get into?  Oh, come on now.  You guys know.  Hello.  Which one?  The whipping.  Oh, whipping.  I like the whip.  Yeah, she likes getting whipped on the ass a little bit.  She enjoys that.  What does she look like, man? 
[03:24:00]  Is she good looking?  She's cute.  I haven't seen any pictures of her.  Are you cute?  Are you good looking, Dee Dee?  Go to their website.  She's like a chipmunk.  Shut up.  You're like a chipmunk.  Are you cute, Dee Dee?  We can't tell because she wears the type of glasses that make her eyes look extra big.  Like Mr. Magoo glasses?  It's because I have, hello, stigmatism.  Stigmatism.  Holy shit.  That is one of the most unsexy words that a bitch can have. 
[03:24:30]  Magoo, you fucked the UPS man again.  Oh, you.  Oh, Patrice.  Oh, okay.  You look like Jerry from the Facts of Life.  The retarded cousin of Blair.  No, that's me.  She's on Deadwood now.  Is Jerry Jewell on Deadwood?  She's on Deadwood.  She plays the gimp that cleans up the bar.  Holy fuck me.  Yeah.  God bless you for still working.  How about her, huh?  You look like a mixture of a lot of things.  You look like a Rosie O'Donnell, John Goodman, and Jerry from Facts of Life. 
[03:25:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  But you know what?  God bless you, sweetie.  This is like a cute thing.  How about your chest?  How big are your breasts?  You can't see it in this picture.  Well, they're not a single D.  Oh, you're a double D?  Okay, sure.  I work with her.  She can work with her.  Dee Dee should like grow bangs so it covers up more of her head.  You want the forehead covered up a little bit?  She should grow bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. 
[03:25:30]  She should grow a machine gun clip.  I'm playing.  I'm playing.  I'm playing.  If you're looking at the picture on the website at xmradio.com, that was taken a few years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hello.  You guys haven't seen me in a while.  No, we haven't.  No.  What have you done?  Remember my Hashimoto's disease?  They put me on that medicine.  Holy shit.  You have Hashimoto's? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, that thyroid condition.  Remember?  What kind of gook disease is that?  What kind of Hashimoto's disease?  You know what that is?  It makes your face look like when Batman from the TV show would punch somebody and the word  would come up.  No, it's a thyroid disease.  Hashimoto's?  She's sick.  What does it do to you, though?  It made me gain weight, but now I lost weight.  Oh.  Yes.  So you'll get to see that when I come to New York.  All righty. 
[03:26:30]  How much did you lose?  You'll see.  Oh, she's going to tell us.  How's the coach?  Healthy?  Healthy?  Let's go to Billy in LA.  Billy?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I want to know if Dee Dee looks like Velma from Scooby-Doo.  Oh, God.  That's one.  Oh, God.  That's what this one kid I used to babysit.  There's a Velma thing going on.  A lot of guys are into the Velma.  She looks like the van.  I'm just joking.  Wait a minute.  What do you mean? 
[03:27:00]  I look like a mystery machine.  I'm just joking.  I'm playing around, sweetie.  I got a problem with your Hashimoto disease.  It's a thyroid condition.  There are symptoms someone with the disease may have.  Now, you said you gained a lot of weight because of the Hashimoto, right?  On an all-new house, Hashimoto disease gives you the body of Godzilla.  How can house cure it?  She has Gamera-itis.  I got a real problem with your Hashimoto disease because you said you gained a lot of weight, right? 
[03:27:30]  Uh-huh.  What does it say?  Because the thyroid gland may swell when you have Hashimoto's disease,  you may have a feeling of fullness or tightness in your throat.  You may have trouble swallowing food or liquids.  It's a UPS man's cock.  This is an Asian guy named Hashimoto.  Because your thyroid isn't producing the right stuff, so your body is not working right.  So when people have thyroid problems, they're either highly hyper and lose a lot of weight, 
[03:28:00]  and their eyes get real big, or they get a little lackadaisical and lazy and gain weight.  I'm very tired.  Like, I had no energy for a while.  I was, like, lethargic.  What's funny is Hashimoto had it.  Yeah.  A nigga named Hashimoto.  Hashimoto.  A Chinese dude walking around with big, puffy eyes.  He's the guy they named it after, so he had to be like,  Hey, doctor, what's wrong with me?  A nigga?  I don't know.  You got U disease.  I never see this before. 
[03:28:30]  Your eyes are bug out.  You're a canter swarrow.  You are fat.  I don't know.  We call it Hashimoto disease.  Give me five.  Dr. Sugar's nigga, we're in it together.  I found it, and you got it.  Hashimoto.  Oh, man.  Somebody.  No, but at least I'm getting better, and they found out what was wrong.  That's the main thing.  And they fixed it with, what, medicine? 
[03:29:00]  I'm on Lavoxel.  It's a medication.  Jesus.  She's just sick.  All right, Dee Dee, we'll see you when you get to New York.  Yeah, and then we can talk about the elder guy from Italy.  What happened?  What?  Remember I told you last time I was on when Jim Norton called up about the song?  I told you guys about the dude from Italy.  Oh, is that who you're seeing, or?  Well, you could, whatever you want to call it.  Oh, having sex with?  The old dude from Italy?  Yeah, the 53-year-old.  63?  No, 5'3". 
[03:29:30]  Oh, a 53-year-old.  Well, how old are you?  No, he's 5'3".  Oh, I thought he was...  How old are you?  I'm an idiot.  I'm young.  53 is an older gentleman for you.  For me, I think, yeah.  When my mom is only, like, about 12 years older than him.  All right, hold on a minute.  An old friend checking in, Bubba Ray Dudley.  Bubba!  Guys, how the hell are you?  How you been, man?  What's going on?  We're talking to Dee Dee about this Hashimoto disease.  Yeah, this is, this is, I'm laughing my ass off in the car, because there's a Hashimoto 
[03:30:00]  who is a pro wrestler in Japan, and he's a big, fat bastard.  Is that what they named it from?  If you get this, you're going to look like him.  We call it the King Kong Bundy disease here.  This little whore may not be lying, you know?  I'm not a whore, and I'm not lying.  You, uh...  Not in that order.  Really?  I think you lean toward whore, though. 
[03:30:30]  Why?  A little bit.  You're a little slutty.  That's good, though.  You're a little...  You know what?  I'm not in a relationship.  You've got to get your needs met, so you know what to...  That's all right.  And you, you know...  How would you like to roll over and listen to that voice every morning?  Why not?  John Carr did.  Oh, nice.  Guys, I hope you're all doing well.  Opie, Anthony, everybody over there.  You guys are great.  I love you, as always.  Opie, remember when I gave you the ride in the limo and you threw up?  Yeah, I did throw up.  I was sitting sideways. 
[03:31:00]  Bubba, what's up?  Where's he at?  Are you at ECW?  Are you at TNA?  Yeah, where are you at these days?  I'm with TNA Wrestling right now.  You and D-Von?  Me and D-Von, TNA Wrestling, which is on every Thursday night at 11 o'clock on Spike TV.  Oh, very cool.  Damn, that's obscure o'clock, man.  What the fuck?  Obscure o'clock.  We need you back somewhere where I can see you all the time.  What the fuck's going on, man?  Well, you know what?  You know, I did everything we could do at ECW. 
[03:31:30]  We did everything we could do in WWE.  I mean, for Christ's sake, we won the world titles 18 different times.  Right.  It's like banging the same chair.  Hey, Bubba, isn't it the one with Don West?  Doesn't he do the announcing?  Yes, Don West.  Don West used to do the QVC for the baseball cards.  That's him.  I got to organize your rookie cards out of here.  Unbelievable Bubba Ray Dudley rookie card.  And how about the money?  Is it okay?  Over there. 
[03:32:00]  Knock on wood.  Think that money's not an issue right now in my career.  Good man.  I'm a big fan.  That's why I'm asking.  I don't want to.  You got anti-Semitic money?  Yeah, we got enough money.  We were talking about that.  If you got enough money to just blurt something anti-Semitic out in front of the whole world  and still be okay, that's money.  Like Mel Gibson.  Bubba Raisin.  Because of this funny story.  I still get fans who hold up signs in the arena and it says, Bubba, what's that string? 
[03:32:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Girl had a period and a little string was poking out.  What's that string?  Jesus.  I'd rather see you.  I'd rather see you, man, than this giant Indian with the bad pituitary gland they got out now.  Get rid of this motherfucker.  Get him in Longest Yard 2.  We do not need to see Giant Fungie, the giant Indian boy, fucking halfway limping around. 
[03:33:00]  Can't move.  One foot is a 24 and the other foot's a 3.  I appreciate that.  I'm sorry.  I know it's the fraternity, man.  I don't want to, but I'll say it.  I'm a fan.  Jesus Christ.  I'm tired of his face.  I'm a fan of the UST.  You make me laugh, man.  You guys are all funny.  All four of you guys are funny.  Even Kaz on the show, he totally brings it down. 
[03:33:30]  Who does?  Kaz.  Oh, Taz.  He sticks up for you, buddy.  No, I know.  Taz is my good friend.  Hey, next time you're in New York, please stop by.  Thank you, guys.  I really appreciate it, and best of luck with your show, and it's going great.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, Bubba Ray.  Bubba Ray Dudley, everyone.  DeeDee, we got to go.  Okay, you guys have a good weekend.  Have you seen it?  Thank you.  Have you watched wrestling at all?  Have you seen this new guy?  Well, he's a wrestler now, the guy from Longest Yard, that giant dude. 
[03:34:00]  Okay.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All our guys are not there anymore, so I haven't watched.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I don't watch the WWE.  I'm such a fan.  I just peek in from time to time.  We were huge fans.  I'll take a peek every once in a while, but I honestly haven't seen him.  My current angle's in ECW now.  He's gone.  Well, it's all fucking Vince McMahon, so it doesn't matter.  All right, let's go to Doug Out Doug.  Doug?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I figured if I can get in here real quick and just talk about the tailgate we got going on for the PNC show. 
[03:34:30]  Are you coming up for the show?  That's awesome.  Yeah, yeah, definitely, man.  I'm definitely coming up.  I've got to make the PNC show.  Happy Typing Girl organized a tailgate before the PNC show.  I think it's starting at like 11 o'clock in the afternoon, and I know there's a lot of people out there, and I know the message board, Full Blown Aids, is where you can get the information.  But, I mean, this is for everybody.  This isn't like, you know, you've got to hold out your message board membership card or anything fucking stupid like that.  Just come by.  There's about to be, there's supposed to be like 50 cars and, you know, like 140 people so far. 
[03:35:00]  Just come by and grab a hot dog and hang out and drink a beer before the show and have a good time.  Where are you guys going to be at?  We're going to be in the parking lot, I believe.  No, I understand that, but do you got a location, or how are people going to find you?  It's going to be a parking lot filled with cars.  Well, you know, we're a bunch of asses.  We're going to have big banners for you guys set up in the parking lot, so you really shouldn't be able to miss us.  All right, cool, very cool.  So you can hit that up, and this weekend in Heart's Tale is our softball game we're having, so if anybody wants to come out to that, there's more information on Full Blown Aids about that, too. 
[03:35:30]  New York versus Boston.  Hey, I'm checking out FullBlownAids.com a lot lately.  You guys are doing a real good job over there.  We're trying to continue the OA experience.  You know, OA experience.com works, too, for people that are at work and don't want to type Full Blown Aids.  All right, very good.  Thanks, Doug.  Have a good vacation, gentlemen.  Yeah, we'll see you guys a week from tomorrow.  Wow.  All right.  British plane lands in Italy after pilot reported suspected bomb on board. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, you know what that'll turn out to be?  Someone dropped a Q-tip in the aisle.  They had Q-tips and mouthwash.  That's what it was.  Well, a suspected bomb on board a British plane got blah, blah, blah.  Stop.  Hey, before we get out of here, where's that story about the HIV thing?  Researchers link music tastes to HIV risks.  More field research, my friend. 
[03:36:30]  This is fake research.  This is backwards research.  Again, we point this out all the time.  When they say, do you know the highest growing population, the fastest growing population of people getting AIDS are now the elderly?  Can you believe that?  It's the elderly.  Yeah, because they had them in 1970 when it first came out.  No, because you look, and the way they have it is like four old people have AIDS.  And then like the next year, like six old people get AIDS. 
[03:37:00]  And they go, wow, it's just jumping by leaps of bounds.  That's just like the movies when they go, the number one horror film.  Nigga, it's the only one out.  Yeah.  And this research is all skewed.  They say, so if you put certain music on, you're less apt to get the disease?  No, there's lifestyles that people lead where they listen to certain music. 
[03:37:30]  And the lifestyle they're leading, if you listen to hip-hop, you're leading more of a lifestyle of unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners.  They're defending hip-hop in this stuff.  How are they doing that?  There's no way to defend it.  Don't make me put my helmet back on.  It says, U.S. boys hooked on gospel, techno, and pop are more at risk of HIV infection than devotees of other musical styles, including bling-bling hip-hop.  Why is that?  According to a new study.  Bling-bling hip-hop.  U.S. boys hooked on gospel, techno, well, techno, you can see, because there's a lot of, like, probably because gay. 
[03:38:00]  That music is made.  I'd say gospel, techno, and pop, you'd get more gay guys.  Well, techno, that music is made for ass sex.  Uh-oh, you got to be careful, though.  Why is that?  That's, you know, he's stigmatizing a group.  Yeah, gospel music, though.  Yo, I got my dick, yo, yo, nigga, you know what?  I caught something, man.  I caught a bad one.  I got my dick sucked at the Pavarotti concert, nigga.  That motherfucker was out there going, oh, and I was in that motherfucker going, oh, and then he, nigga, fuck, and I caught some shit. 
[03:38:30]  That's sweet.  I got my dick sucked at the Nutcracker.  Do you think anybody gets their dick sucked at the Nutcracker?  Yo, what you doing?  I'm in my head.  Hey, no, why don't you come back and suck my dick?  The cloud is on.  Fuck that nigga.  Come suck my dick.  This is a non-story.  This research stinks.  I mean, Elton John.  You're against research, O.P.  Elton John continues to sell out. 
[03:39:00]  Thank you.  That's my point.  Thank you.  Next story.  The music industry often says there's no connection between music and sexual behavior.  But hundreds of young men interviewed in New York this year fiercely disagreed, said lead researcher, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm not buying it.  Guys ain't, straight guys don't really get things from girls, man. 
[03:39:30]  Guys are giving things to women.  Boys who listen to hip-hop had more sex and more partners.  That's what I tell myself.  But it did not impact condom use.  Make me feel better about myself.  They found boys who listen to hip-hop music were more likely to have vaginal intercourse and more partners.  But boys from church or New York club scenes, techno pop, blah, blah, blah, blah, took the most sexual risks.  All right.  So you get guys.  Do you two young gentlemen use condoms?  Fuck that.  Condoms.  I'm monogamous.  How long were you together before you put a condom on? 
[03:40:00]  When did you make that no condom decision?  Day one.  No condoms.  You just slipped it in?  How about you, motherfucker?  Fuck that shit.  How about you?  Still use a condom or no?  Raw doggy?  Condoms are a rumor.  Come on, secret in love, motherfucker.  Secret in love.  No one knows.  All you got to do is say condom or no.  I do my thing.  Condom or no.  I do my thing.  I got special moves.  Stop.  No condom.  Special moves.  Uh-oh. 
[03:40:30]  This is fucking in love ass.  I fucking.  That means.  That's the pullout.  What an asshole.  It's like.  That's the pullout.  Don't be fucking saying nothing.  Don't say raw.  Don't say bag it.  Nothing.  I used to.  I bagged it up and then my shit started going limp and I just stuck it in the shower one  time and she was like, all right, fuck it.  It's clean.  We're raw.  Just clean it up.  What are you going to do?  Let's both cross our fingers, nigga.  That's my only protection is hope.  Cross.  Cross our fingers.  That'll work. 
[03:41:00]  Cross my fingers.  That research stinks.  Well, it's very interesting, aren't we?  It's dumb.  Oh, by the way, the dump sheet, you were the potty mouth today.  Yeah, I had both of them.  Ooh.  It's obvious that we're a day away from vacation because you let your guard down today, my friend.  I deemed her show shite, Anthony about Whoopi's show, knowing that shite wouldn't make it  through, but I already had the SH out, so I was committed.  Try bollocks, though.  Bollocks.  Bollocks is a worse swear in England than shite. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, shite is shit with the ice, but bollocks is worse.  Shite should be okay.  But 8.50 a.m. I said, I saw a hunk of shit that resembled the Virgin Patty.  Anthony forgetting he wasn't at XM yet.  That's what Al wrote.  That was really good.  But it is weird, and I swear to you, it is the truth.  When I'm turned around 180 degrees at the FM studios looking that way, I forget where  I am. 
[03:42:00]  It's like, for some reason, I curse, and then I turn and look at what I usually look at,  then I know that I can't curse.  There you go.  Weird.  All right, we should get out of here.  Where's Big A?  Weird.  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.  It's vacation time.  Woo!  Yahoo!  I had a pound of dildo in my ass with my ball sack.  I forget.  As the thumbs go up, write it.  Mark the time when Anthony said that so we can pull it later for a promo.  Do the big plug there, Big A.  You guys got a special night, right? 
[03:42:30]  I thought that was him.  Might as well be, right?  Nice.  Oh, we forgot to play Waiting for a Girl Like You.  I've been waiting.  Do we have that?  What kind of fucking heart and strength do you think Big A has?  We'll end the show with that.  It's like monster strength.  Oh, my God.  He could probably bend that microphone.  You're strong, right?  Oh, my God.  You're like the Hulk.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Ben's stealing his bare hands.  All right, what's the big plug there?  Ben, Ben's.  Tonight at FH Riley's. 
[03:43:00]  You got the fingers going.  Look at that hand.  Of Mike and Heather's wedding reception.  Let's all do it.  A party.  And karaoke.  Yeah.  Tonight, 8 p.m.  At FH Riley's.  400 New York Avenue in my lovely Huntington.  Holy fuck me, man.  Tell everyone how nice my brother is. 
[03:43:30]  Because everyone, you know, the rest of my family gets a bad reputation because of me.  Actually.  Actually.  You got a Zapruder film this fucking plug.  Actually, the bread is very nice.  The film strip is stuck.  What?  He likes the bread at the place or something.  What?  Actually, I said, the bread is very nice.  Yeah.  And so is brother Elmo.  Did he say the bread?  Bread.  Bread.  Oh, your brother. 
[03:44:00]  The bread's good, too, though.  Right?  Of course.  So, what's going on here?  I have no fucking idea.  See, I don't miss this.  It's a big plug.  Because they had their first date at FH Riley, so you're going back.  So, tonight is tonight?  It's the scene of the crime there, yeah.  FH Riley tonight.  So, master pose to master ceremonies.  You guys better get audio for when we're back from vacation.  That plug should be bashed up your ass with your own ball sack.  Yahoo. 
[03:44:30]  And then, like, Dawn is singing a song with master.  It's going to be a wonderful duet as the wedding song sung by none other than Master Poe and  My Sister Dawn.  Where's the address?  New York Avenue.  In Huntington.  In Huntington.  Where is it?  Out there in Long Island.  Long Island.  Suffolk County.  We'll have to get you out there sometime, Patrice.  All right, what else?

He might show up.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to tear down the eighth wall there, but also we got some videos we're going 
[03:45:30]  to play.  We're going to play our new commercial down there for the folks.  You can check it out on opianathlete.com if you want.  And Patrice, Caroline's.  Yes.

Polando and Dawn.  We got Big A singing Waiting. 
[03:46:00]  Waiting.  Is it Waiting On or Waiting For?  I've been waiting for a girl like you.  For?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll just do the song.  This is Big A when we first met him and realized that your speech thing was a mess.  We had you sing this little song.  We might be back after the song.  If we're not, we'll be gone for a week.  You might be.  I'll see you, people.  Have to vacate.  I am so fucking out of here.  What's the sound of this motherfucking M.P. is going down there? 
[03:46:30]  Big A.  Big A, everyone.  Been looking too hard.  Been waiting too long.  Sometimes I don't know what I will find.  I only know it's a matter of time.  When you love someone.  When you love someone.  It feels so right. 
[03:47:00]  So warm and true.  I need to know if you feel it too.  Maybe I'm too strong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Would you tell me if I'm coming?  I'm too strong.  A heart of mine has been hurt before.  This time I want to be sure.  I've been waiting for a girl like you. 
[03:47:30]  To come into my life.  I've been waiting for a girl like you.  Loving will survive.  I've been waiting for someone new.  To make me feel alive.  Waiting for a girl like you. 
[03:48:00]  To come into my life.  You're so good  When we make love  It's understood  It's more than a torch  Only in dreams 
[03:48:30]  Be this way  When you love someone  Yeah  Really love someone  Now I know it's right  From the moment I wake up  To deep in the night  Nowhere on earth  I'd rather be  Holding you  See
