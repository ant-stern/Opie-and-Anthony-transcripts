<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts establishing their controversial reputation, immediately launching into vulgar humor and dark jokes with Jim Norton, including a particularly tasteless joke from Norton about a dead baby's name.  Technical difficulties with Anthony's microphone provided extended comedic fodder.  They then promoted upcoming live shows in Philadelphia, including a free show at the TLA and a paid comedy show in Camden.

The broadcast then acknowledged the 9/11 anniversary, focusing heavily on the hosts' cynical view of the news media's overly solemn coverage, contrasting it with their usual programming.  Their commentary on this was laced with sarcasm and dark humor.  This segment was followed by a phone call from comedian Jeff Ross, who recounted his experience at the MTV VMAs, offering a vulgar and highly critical account of Britney Spears' performance and the fight between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee.  Ross also mentioned his participation in the Flavor Flav roast. The conversation returned to the 9/11 anniversary and the media's response, punctuated by Jim Norton sharing an anecdote about a frustrating retail experience that led to an argument with his girlfriend.

The show transitioned into a segment dominated by 80s new wave music, specifically Duran Duran and Def Leppard, with the hosts interjecting crude humor and frequent use of the phrase "That's good" in response to the music.  Numerous listener calls followed, mostly concerning outrageously high international roaming charges from AT&T and iPhone.  One caller recounted a friend punching someone who grabbed his ass at a Duran Duran concert.  The 9/11 anniversary was revisited with further criticism of the media and a seemingly shady charity benefiting from 9/11 donations.  They also interacted with a new, surprisingly uninformed intern, Jess, whose lack of knowledge about the show was a source of amusement and frustration.  Other topics included listener claims about shared cell towers by Verizon and AT&T, the hosts' upcoming Philadelphia appearance, a discussion of a serious football injury, a disagreement about their weekly football picks, a recent wedding, and various other tangents and jokes, including potentially offensive topics such as a listener's crude joke and comments about AIDS and the electric chair.

A significant portion of the broadcast detailed a bachelor party and subsequent fishing trip.  The hosts recounted the debauchery of Brett's bachelor party, culminating in his humiliation at a strip club, allegedly handcuffed and naked, and his drunken calls to his fianc√©e.  The ensuing fishing trip was delayed due to Brett's hangover.  The trip featured the host's brother Scott, a marine biologist, catching a seagull on his line, leading to a discussion about rescuing the injured bird.  Paige, another hungover participant, added to the chaos by vomiting, attracting bluefish.  Sean William Scott (Stifler) appeared as a guest, promoting *Mr. Woodcock*, discussing his past jobs and experiences with *American Pie* fame.  The hosts expressed extreme frustration with a poorly written advertisement script for Cash4Gold.com, using profuse profanity.  Britney Spears's VMAs performance was again criticized, this time described as a career-ender.  The segment concluded with a mention of Big A's drunken phone call to another radio show about a past relationship with a woman from Trinidad.

A discussion about Clearasil commercials deemed offensive by the Parents Television Council (PTC) ensued.  The hosts played audio clips from a CNN debate featuring Debbie Wolf, co-founder of People Against Censorship (PAC), who defended the commercials.  The conversation was heavily laden with vulgar language and sexual references.  Audio from Bob Kelly's radio show, featuring Anthony (Big A) revealing his three-year marriage to a woman from Trinidad he met at a Burger King, was played, with Anthony declining further discussion.  Several poorly written 9/11 tribute songs were played and ridiculed.

The final segment involved a poorly executed rhyming game for a 9/11 commemoration, filled with vulgar jokes and digressions.  The hosts discussed a inexplicably popular song by Christy after 9/11 and offered a scathing critique of another patriotic song ("We Wear Red").  Big A's alleged indiscretions with a mail-order bride from Trinidad were discussed in explicit detail.  The show concluded with a chaotic game to guess a sponsor ("Bodog"), more vulgar commentary, and preparations for an upcoming meeting.  The hosts' frequent use of profanity and sexually explicit jokes continued throughout.  An upcoming Philadelphia event was mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Super controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like you're the I-man, I'm going to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to give up my name, Jim Norton.  I'm going to find a dead baby, take his name.  I don't know where I'll find the social security. 
[00:01:00]  I'm going to pass by houses where you see brand new cribs at the curb.  Hopi and Anthony.  Stupid Australians whose national hero got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show. 
[00:01:30]  Ah, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Speaking of spreading, we're heading to Philly, what, after tomorrow's show? 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  So we say once again, good morning to Philadelphia.  Hi, Philly.  We'll be there.  I want to sound local.  Hi, Philadelphia.  Philly-delphia.  Hi, Philadelphia.  What's going on?  My mic sounds weird.  Does it?  Yeah, I just got to deal with it.  Who knows why gremlins come in here.  It's a little bassy and low.  But we screw it. 
[00:03:00]  Hi.  I think when we take a day off, someone just comes sneaking in here and just has to fiddle with everything.  Fiddle.  They want to be a broadcaster someday, so they probably sit in our seats and just fiddle around.  This is really bad.  Is it really?  Yeah.  And for me, I'm usually pretty adaptable.  It's very muffly.  Like I have...  It's like there's styrofoam in my ears.  Yeah, is that it?  Maybe?  Maybe a little switch?  No, that didn't do anything.  No?  Oh, well. 
[00:03:30]  You're welcome.  Well, now the music's over.  You're right.  Now, let me turn this up.  Oh, boy.  I'll just blow my ears out.  All right.  Our phone number is 877-212-ONA.  Yeah, we're broadcast live from Philly Thursday and Friday.  You know, we got the last comedy show on Saturday at Camden across the river there.  Bring your Kevlar.  Bring your Kevlar.  Look out, Camden.  Here we come.  Yeah, keep listening to YSP all day long.  And they got all the info you need for our trip to Philly. 
[00:04:00]  But basically, we'll be at YSP Thursday.  And then Friday, we're going to be at the TLA, I believe, on South Street, doing a live show.  Yep.  Hopefully, a bunch of us will...  A bunch of us.  We certainly will.  Hopefully, a bunch of our listeners will get up early and join us.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday at the TLA, 4th and South Street in Philly.  And it's free.  No tickets needed.  So, there you go.  And we're going to be giving away all sorts of stuff, including, yes, Eagles tickets.  Eagles tickets for their Monday night game, right?  Correct. 
[00:04:30]  Very, very good.  So, is your mic all right, bro?  No, but I'm going to have to deal with it.  It's just really like...  Why do things change every time we take a day off?  It's really just...  It's like I got to...  It's like I got to yell!  It's still not working right.  It's all muffly.  Jimmy, why don't you listen?  Can Jimmy use your headphones for a sec?  Well, he can.  Well, I don't know if it's...  I don't know.  See, this is what we do...  Oh, I got my mic.  This is what we do when the studio's not set for us. 
[00:05:00]  We waste valuable time tweaking and trying to figure out what's wrong with the equipment.  Hi.  What's wrong?  Does it sound...  He's insane, right?  No, no, no, no.  Screw that.  Screw that.  I know what this is supposed to sound like, and this ain't it.  You got your ears clogged?  What's up?  But now I got to deal with it.  No.  You were dealing with a cold last week.  You all right with that?  Yeah, that's like gone.  All right.  I got to deal with it.  Great.  Because someone fiddled with something. 
[00:05:30]  Is Tim working on it?  I don't know.  He adjusted a microphone and then he walked out, so did that do anything?  No.  No.  All right.  Five minutes of the show.  We haven't done anything because we're trying to figure out what's wrong with Anthony's mic.  Screw it.  Just forge ahead.  All right.  Hey, it's the anniversary of 9-11, and quite frankly, we don't know what to do with it on  our radio show.  We were kind of throwing the ball around in the office.  What do we do?  Do we go somber like the local news stations? 
[00:06:00]  Do we go all somber on everybody?  We should have played somber rage music.  Yeah.  All the news stations have now decided they're going to do somber versions of their theme song  to commemorate 9-11.  They're all dressed in black.  Yes.  They have all the emblems, the red, white, and blue ribbons, and the 9-11 logos.  Their graphics are all up.  For one day, they want us to forget that they actually do stories on squirrels like water 
[00:06:30]  skiing.  And bikini babes.  Bikini babes.  Things like that.  Yeah.  For one day.  Right.  And then for one day, they don't talk about all the controversies and stuff from the building  down there, and everything else, and the war, and everything.  Now they're just, let's think of the victims, and oh, we got the somber music.  Well, here's the somber music for Jill TV, Channel 11.  This is what they're playing in and out of breaks. 
[00:07:00]  It's upbeat somber.  This is upbeat somber.  It's their music.  Yeah.  But it's just done somber.  What, they took their theme music and slowed it down?  Oh, phonies.  Everyone's just phony.  What is that?  The, uh, oh, we got more slow music? 
[00:07:30]  Somber music?  Let's hear.  And what's that?  This is Enya.  This is Enya.  Enya.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who can say where the road goes?  I like that.  Yes.  Don't tell me you like this.  I do.  Stop it.  Shut up.  I do.  I like the Enya, too.  No, you don't.  I like Enya.  I like the Enya.  Enya?  I like to call it the Enya.  It's massage music, actually.  The Enya.  Is it? 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  There's nothing wrong with the Enya.  I could picture this being.  And this isn't somber.  This is just kind of like, uh, uh, uh, reflective.  This is kind of what?  What would you call this?  This is a little douchey.  Douche.  Douchey.  I would call this douchey.  Uh, oh, by the way, I turned that Enya off.  We're all going to fall asleep.  Uh, this is what, uh, Channel 11 usually plays.  But because it's 9-11, you know, you got to go all serious for a day. 
[00:08:30]  That's how they go in and out of break.  Big news.  This is when it's Dance Friday.  Yeah, but today, you know, they got to slow it down and make it a bit somber.  You know, and the anniversary of 9-11 every year just sucks.  I mean, what are you supposed to do?  But I don't get what, I don't get what the news does.  I don't get how they have to, like, suck more emotion out of us.  Yeah, that's their whole gig.  It's a weird day for everybody, including people that, uh, live and work in, you know,  Manhattan. 
[00:09:00]  It's just a weird day.  You just feel it.  You wake up and you just don't feel the same.  You know what I mean?  How do you just know it's the date at this point?  Right.  Let's be honest.  You hear 9-11 is the date and it's like, ah, okay, yeah, that was like the bad day, uh,  six years ago.  But for the most part, it's the family and the people that know people that, uh, died.  Those are the ones most affected.  The news gets up there and tries to bring everyone back into the fold like it's the same day.  Right.  Like, it's 9-11-2001 and please, please let the suck emotion out of you. 
[00:09:30]  Get out of here.  Stop being phonies.  They suck emotion out of you without getting anything done.  No.  You know, maybe they could use this day to get some things done.  Whatever that would be, I don't even know.  I'll just throw that on the table.  You know, suck the emotions out of us, but get something done.  Whatever that is.  Nothing.  Whatever that is.  But they're, they're just doing it for ratings and they're doing it because everyone else  is down in that giant hole downtown.  I was, uh, I was biking the, uh, the Westside, uh, bike path recently.  I went down there, Jimmy, Jimmy knows the, the bike path and I went down to ground zero 
[00:10:00]  before I turned around.  Right.  That place is amazing.  Except for the hole in the ground.  Except for the giant hole in the ground.  Because of, uh, what?  Red tape and all that crap holding everything back.  Yeah.  Because, uh, around the giant hole, it's almost unrecognizable from six years ago.  It's all glass buildings everywhere.  Yeah.  Brand new glass buildings everywhere.  Yeah, they've been building over there.  They've been building like crazy in that area.  It's not, not where the towers were.  Right.  But that is still just a, you know, a huge hole in the ground.  Because no one knows what to do. 
[00:10:30]  You got to deal with 18 different frigging, uh, organizations and, and the, uh, family of  the victims have a say in what goes on because politicians don't want to go against them  because they'll look like bad guys.  So nothing gets done.  And they have some jackass drop, something called the Freedom Tower, which is just a,  a, a joke.  It's a joke.  Put towers back.  Yeah, just put a couple towers back.  Some modern ones back.  And, uh, you know, then just use the top floors as storage. 
[00:11:00]  Storage.  You know, for people that want a place to, you know, keep their bike or something.  I don't know.  Just go up top, put your bike in, and then get out of there quick.  Because I'm so sick of saying, you know, if they build the towers as high as they were,  no one's going to live up there or work up there.  So we can't do that.  They will.  They certainly will.  Especially if you connect the buildings like they do with those towers in Malaysia.  Yeah.  Connect them somehow or give people a way out.  A few connection thingies.  There's the stupid picture of the Freedom Tower. 
[00:11:30]  Look at that.  The thing's 10 stories tall with 80 stories of lattice work.  Yeah.  The Freedom Tower.  Sure.  It's great.  Because we're all free in America.  That's why.  That's what we're telling the rest of the world.  We're free in America.  That's like also Newark Airport.  No, after 9-11.  Let's call it Liberty Airport.  Yeah.  Just change the names of things and everything will be cool.  Right.  I personally enjoyed the, over the weekend, the Osama Bin Laden tape. 
[00:12:00]  That was amazing.  He's now my favorite candidate for president of the United States.  Because apparently he was running for office.  Did you see this?  I did not see this.  Did you see the transcripts or anything?  Please fill me in.  Holy Jesus.  Please fill me in.  Well, the guy discussed the mortgage problems here in this country.  He did not.  Dude, I'm not kidding.  He discussed the mortgage problems, the economy.  Yeah.  He discussed the war in Iraq. 
[00:12:30]  He had discussed how the Democrats won Congress, but haven't done anything because the government  is really run by big business.  And the Democrats are talking about how they want to get the troops out.  And now they're in charge, but they haven't done it either.  So it's a big business that runs the company.  And I'm listening to this guy going, where can I vote for this Osama Bin Laden guy?  Is he going to be a write-in candidate?  I think that name is going to be a problem because he sounds like the terrorist guy. 
[00:13:00]  It's the same name.  And then he started talking about the worst crime in a person's life could be to die without  accepting Allah.  And I was like, oh my God, wait, that is the same Osama Bin Laden guy.  And then I might have a problem voting for him.  Well, here's the problem, though.  If you don't vote for him, you know, your head will come off.  So, true.  You know, you got a little, what to do, what to do in this case.  The guy was sitting and I'm watching going.  He's got some great ideas. 
[00:13:30]  But he can't actually vote for him.  But if you don't vote for him, then they lop your head off.  So what do you do?  And then they, even like he shaved his beard off and colored it.  He was like, just for man or something in his beard.  So his beard's all dark now because he's trying to look younger because he knows that other  voters want a younger candidate.  He's had some work done.  He kind of reminds me of Pesci in My Cousin Vinny.  He looks good, but it's like, eh, something's been done with you.  Something's happening there, yeah.  It's good to know that even if you live in a cave, you're a bit vain about your look. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, about your looks.  There's a mirror in that cave somewhere or a puddle he can look into.  He's risking someone finding out which cave he's in just so they can get some just for  men into the cave.  Yeah, if you find that little brush with the little black just for men in there, they  could track it down.  What do you mean a little brush?  I don't know.  A little brush comes with it.  Oh, really?  I did not know that.  Yeah.  Well, I used just for men a couple of times when we were on Letterman.  Did you? 
[00:14:30]  And Leno.  It did?  Yeah, because the glistening of the gray in the beard is very bad on TV.  It looks like tinsel.  I thought we went into a time machine.  My God.  No, no.  My God, man.  I wouldn't do it now because it's a little too much gray.  It would be a little too stark.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Anyway.  I'm still trying to figure out what to do with this.  You've got to shave it.  I remember.  I remember.  shave it during the Philly show.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  Hitler mustache?  Oh, my God.  If you came out on stage in Philly or actually Camden for the virus show this Saturday. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You know, they would have liked something like that.  Well, they probably would.  They're a bunch of sick bastards down there.  So, anyway, we have the sixth anniversary of 9-11 today.  Yes.  Look, you know, it sucks.  Yeah, but, you know.  It sucks.  That's what it is.  And the paper today is like, anybody that does a talk show on the radio will be discussing 9-11 today.  Well, see, we did.  We did.  What do you want from us?  You kind of have to. 
[00:15:30]  It is, you know.  Yeah.  I'd rather discuss the fact that I didn't know 9-11 was the birthday of Christy McNichol.  She's 45 years old today.  Really?  Christy McNichol was born on September 11th.  You know, that's not a bad idea.  What else happened on 9-11?  I was just surprised she was 45.  Yeah?  Old dyke.  How do you know she's a dyke?  Yeah, Mike's much better, man.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Only...  What happened, Tim?  What was the problem?  Someone was fiddling.  Somebody fiddled. 
[00:16:00]  Someone fiddled.  Why can't they just lock the effing door?  Who else is using this studio?  Nobody.  That should be.  That's good.  Nice and crisp now.  All right.  We're putting cameras in here.  I was coming...  Security cameras.  Yeah.  In the cab today.  And I was thinking the same thing.  Like, there were people on September 11th of 01 that just died naturally or that were  killed in some sort of an accident.  Oh, yeah.  In Jersey in a car accident.  And it's like, talk about being overshadowed.  Yeah.  You get nothing.  Uncle Frank did...  Did he?  Yeah.  I remember he was driving down... 
[00:16:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Good for him.  What happened?  Good for him.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  Plenty of stuff happened, but, you know, that was kind of the big story of the day.  Yeah.  And here in New York, we only recognize the World Trade Center.  Mm-hmm.  Like, in Washington, are they doing the Pentagon?  I'm sure they are.  Yeah.  And in some of your Pennsylvania stations, are they doing the...  What was that?  96? 
[00:17:00]  What?  98?  What flight was that?  93.  93?  Flight 93.  Flight 93.  Keep track of the numbers six years later.  Flight 93.  And then there's a beach on Long Island that has 15-foot towers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you could go over there and, you know, give your whatever.  Out in Nassau County, they watched it from 20 miles away over the water, and they have  a big memorial out there for the people that gathered on the beach.  I just don't get it.  It's like, it's a dark day to begin with, but then, look, look at the news. 
[00:17:30]  These phonies do stupid news stories all day long, but today they're all dressed in black.  Yeah, they're all dressed respectable.  No cleavage today for the local news women.  No, Jill had a very subdued black number on.  She's like in mourning.  You think there's a memo that goes out, look, everyone, you know.  Oh, absolutely.  Everyone wear their funeral clothes tomorrow.  Yeah, wear your funeral clothes.  Graphics department, we need a Manhattan skyline with maybe some blue tinge fading around it. 
[00:18:00]  Make it respectful.  Yeah.  Jill Nicolini is dressed like Barbra Streisand and Yenta.  Yeah, we were saying, thank God September 11th didn't fall on a Friday, because they'd  have to do a slow, somber version of Dance Friday.  Yeah.  They'd be waltzing.  Isn't today the day you want to see a little more cleavage on TV?  Help us out.  Because we all know it's a sad day to begin with, so why do they try to pull more sadness  out of a human being?  I don't get that.  We all go through horrific things in our lives, and I don't get the part where you've got to 
[00:18:30]  make it even worse.  Yeah.  You've got to make the montage videos that make you cry.  You've got to play the sad music.  For a year after September 11th, 2001, everyone was effed up.  Effed up.  You start getting all teary-eyed at the drop of a hat.  They mentioned stuff, and the one-year anniversary where the children and stuff would come up 
[00:19:00]  and read the names of their parents that were killed, that stuff was heavy duty.  After that, it's like, and believe me, I'm not talking about not caring.  I'm probably one of the few people that think about it all the time and give it some  thought on a daily basis, not just every year.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of hard when you drive in and you see a couple of buildings missing.  Well, that's why we point this out. 
[00:19:30]  They're a bunch of phonies.  Tomorrow, they'll be back to cleavage.  They'll be back to the squirrel water skiing.  They'll be back to this, you know, tiny, tiny panties on the news because they've got to do  some kind of, you know, fashion show for everybody, you know.  Happy birthday, Mickey Hart.  Mickey Hart.  64 years old today from the Grateful Dead.  Happy birthday to you.  And how about this?  Johnny Unitas died on 9-11.  Who cares, right?  Who even remembers?  Hey, this is ABC News usually. 
[00:20:00]  Listen to this.  Say this.  Yeah.  New.  Brr.  All right.  But because it's 9-11 today, they have to do this.  They're coming right back.  Oh, God.  Bunch of phonies.  And we point this out today, I've got to say it again, because these same stations will  be back to all their crap tomorrow.  Yeah.  They won't even fade out of it like, well, yesterday we had a tough day, the sixth anniversary of 
[00:20:30]  9-11.  Today we want to, you know, maybe do a little more on this.  Oh, no.  Back to bright colors.  Hot, hot, hot.  We'll be playing.  Yeah.  Going in and out of break.  Cleavage for everybody.  Hey, we're going to tell you about a dog today that skateboards.  Right.  There you go.  I watched this documentary called Telling Nicholas.  It's on like HBO On Demand.  It's about September 11th.  This guy was filming it from his loft.  He's a filmmaker.  And then he goes to Staten Island. 
[00:21:00]  And I don't know how he saw a picture of a mother and a little kid.  And the mother was missing.  It was a photo of her and her kid.  So he went to see the family, like, September 13th.  And the whole documentary is about them trying to prepare to tell this kid that they don't  think his mom is coming home.  It's really miserable.  I haven't seen all of it yet, though.  Jeez, why watch something like that?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  Well, anyway.  I can't watch that stuff.  Anyway, we'll be, I don't know.  We'll be doing something with this anniversary.  What can I tell you?  It sucks. 
[00:21:30]  There's a lot of people that just don't want to be reminded of this day.  They just want this day to be over.  Yeah, remember it, which is fine.  But this maudlin, like, phoniness.  Do you think the head of the news is going, like, handing them that somber tape going, like,  look, I really personally want this played because this is a sad day for everybody.  It's like, all right, you saw the memo.  Make sure we get out the, get the sappy music out.  Play that instead of our usual music. 
[00:22:00]  Black clothes for everyone.  Like, no one cares.  It's not like a big, they're not doing it for the reason they should be,  which is, you know, that they care about it.  You know, anyone that, business, anyone that lost a loved one on 9-11,  know what they want more than anything?  Their loved one?  Besides that?  What?  They want September 12th to be here.  Yeah.  They don't want to sit around.  They just want the day to go by as fast as possible.  Every year you just got to dwell on it.  Yeah.  And they got to twist the screws on you.  That's the only thing they want besides their loved one back is the day to be over with 
[00:22:30]  so they could get, you know, get out of that sadness.  And now we got some interviews with some widows and, yeah, there you go.  That's the way to handle it.  All right.  Well, we'll take our first break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  Bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.

We're talking about the somber music they have to play because it's the anniversary  of 9-11.  Yeah.  In and out of, you know, commercials on the local news.  And Chris writes, this is the day when oboe players finally get work.  Very good, Chris.  Let's say hi to, oh, Jeff Ross is falling asleep, but he wanted to comment about a couple  things before he went to bed. 
[00:23:30]  Jeffrey.  Hey, old buddy.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing good, man.  I'm in L.A.  It's late here.  You sound like it's late.  A little run over from the VMAs.  Oh, you were there.  That's right.  They showed you in the audience.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they did.  You were in shock watching Britney Spears just completely destroy her, what was left of  her career.  I was also at the dress rehearsal and it was kind of, she just kind of like walked through  it.  Didn't want to be there.  Yeah, that's what everyone was saying.  She kind of just went through the motions and didn't really care. 
[00:24:00]  Her lip syncing was so off and she just really didn't look like the Britney of old.  No.  She looked like old Britney.  People said she was out until seven in the morning, too, the night before, so maybe she  was sedated.  I don't know.  Hung over.  What was the vibe in the room, though, when people were watching her?  Because it really was amazing to watch her so awful.  You know, like, I've been in these things before and a lot of times the celebrities are  the last ones in their seats.  They don't really care. 
[00:24:30]  They sort of wander in as the show starts.  But people were pretty psyched for this Britney thing.  They were rooting for her and then she just came out and it was just like, she clearly  didn't want to be there.  And if she doesn't care, why should we give a hoot?  Were they really rooting for her or, I mean, I would think you would get to your seat because  you're about to see a train wreck.  You want to see the freak show.  Nothing I saw on the news leading up to this gave me the impression that she was going to  have a really good performance.  Well, it was curiosity. 
[00:25:00]  Curiosity, sure.  People were like, is this magician schmuck going to pop out of her hat?  What's going to happen?  Is she going to kiss somebody?  Is she going to have a reunion with Justin?  You know, like, there was all this, like, teeny bopper gossip going on.  So we were just curious, you know?  Yeah.  I was just stoned waiting for a good show, really.  I noticed they showed a lot of the homeboys right after her performance when everybody  was clapping and they showed a lot of the homeboys because they kind of would have liked  to have seen that big ass like that. 
[00:25:30]  That's why they were rooting for her.  Yeah, they were rooting for her.  They're like, damn.  We got Britney right where we want.  Now we got Britney.  With that big white ass.  You know, supposedly she was supposed to wear something else and she didn't like the outfit  that MTV picked out for her.  Yeah.  This is so stupid that we know this crap.  Of course we do.  But she's...  It's on the slutty of the outfit, right?  Yeah.  Well, no, they gave her an outfit that was going to, like, hide some of the hurt that's  on her body and she didn't think it was sexy enough. 
[00:26:00]  So what you saw on the VMAs was her own outfit that she changed into at the last minute  because she thinks she looks good.  That's how delusional she is.  It's pretty much a bikini.  Now, does she look good for someone that had two kids?  Absolutely.  But you're talking about Britney Spears.  The only reason she's on the stage is because, you know, she's a sex bot.  You got hot chicks in the audience like that hero's chick, Hayden Planetarium.  That's the hottest chick.  Hayden Planetarium.  Hayden Planetarium.  Yeah, she is pretty hot.  You know, where's this picture, Iraq?  They're showing a picture of Britney from Sunday night and she's bending over and she's got 
[00:26:30]  lasagna belly.  Like, that is...  Why would she bend over like that?  She's bending full.  She's no choice.  What, Iraq?  We have it up on our site.  Oh, we have it on our site.  We have all the shots that are not flattering.  It was a great shot of when, I guess, they boost her up onto another platform and it was  just a complete rear end shot.  Yeah.  And it was horrific.  That was also like a weird thing.  And they have like, they're cutting, they have 40 dancers on stage and the big close-up is 
[00:27:00]  like, of her ass is like, her like stepping up.  Yeah.  Yeah, stepping up on a platform, like the most awkward move.  Grandma.  It was ridiculous.  She probably has to lose 20 pounds.  20 pounds.  Yeah, to look like.  To be in that outfit that she had on.  Yeah.  Acceptable in that.  I don't know.  I was in the front row.  I put a dollar in her bra.  I was telling Anthony during the break, she looked like a stripper from like, I don't  know, Bayshore. 
[00:27:30]  Like one of these strippers that doesn't want to strip anymore, but has to pay the rent.  Yeah.  She was just kind of wandering around the stage.  She just decided not to lip sync anymore.  Then she had the nerve to claim that she was upset because she knew what Sarah Silverman  was going to say about her, but believe me, she had no idea.  No.  Know what this is about?  Someone got her in a studio to, you know, to come out with a song and the song is kind  of a hit.  So they're like, all right, here's your comeback.  The song's here. 
[00:28:00]  Here it is.  Even though she's barely like, there's no talent involved with that song that's out.  Anyone could be doing that.  And they're like, all right, now you go on stage, you lip sync to it and there's your  comeback.  But instead, I think we just saw the end of her career.  She could have worn something.  Yeah.  A little less revealing, still kind of sexy looking, but.  Well, that's what MTV had in mind.  And then Chris Angel, he did a whole stage show for her that they, she blew off.  Supposedly it was a whole bunch of mirrors and stuff.  But then again, if you're looking like that, maybe you don't want to see yourself in a mirror.  She doesn't want a mirror. 
[00:28:30]  Why wear a bikini?  Why not something a little bit more of.  Because she's nuts.  That's why we love her.  Oh.  I don't want.  I don't want.  What's going on there?  Well, she did another VAD shot for everybody.  I think that was.  Whoopsie daisy.  She did another oopsie.  I think after the VMA is getting out of a car.  It's amazing, like she was going to get out of the car and you just see an apple fall  out from under her skirt.  Dude, that just looks weird.  Yeah.  That, hers looks really weird.  It's awful.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on down there. 
[00:29:00]  I just had dinner with Rich Voss.  Oh, how was that?  It was really, it was the first time I've ever had dinner with him where it wasn't depressing.  He's like a made man.  He bought a new Porsche.  He's got a baby.  A made man, yeah.  He really thinks he's 35 again.  Voss is finished.  He's going backwards.  Did he spit anything on you while he was eating?  Yes, he did, as a matter of fact.  Russian dressing and coleslaw.  Yeah, he's bad with coleslaw and potato salad. 
[00:29:30]  It goes all over you.  Hey, by the way.  He's advertising the VMAs on his teeth.  Hey, Jeffrey, what did you think of the Flavor Flav roast?  Oh, it was great, man.  It was the most fun I had all summer.  Yeah, that one, you killed on that.  That was great.  That was so much fun.  I didn't want to do it either.  I thought it was going to be a really mess.  But when they started to put it together and they told me Snoop was doing it, I was like,  all right, man.  I'll write some black jokes for a couple weeks. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, that's why it was great.  They really didn't go politically correct with it.  You were able to make some ethnic jokes.  That was fun.  That was a new challenge.  I really enjoyed that a lot.  Maybe on Flavor of Love 3.  I don't know what he's got in mind for me, but he adopted me as his white homeboy.  I'm amazed we're going to watch Flavor of Love 3.  Three.  I mean, the first time, okay.  Then the second, you're like, all right, maybe the girl had some baggage.  All right, so he has to do it again.  A third time. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  He's not finding no girl at this point.  They're just going to keep going until somebody dies of AIDS.  Won't be long now.  So there you have it.  Jeffrey Ross was in the audience for the Britney disaster.  Yeah.  It was a very exciting time, man.  The whole thing was pretty wacky.  I watched the fight between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, too.  Oh, really?  How did that go?  I actually protected Sarah Soberman from getting punched. 
[00:31:00]  Really?  Something tells me that she could handle herself in any situation.  I'm just kidding, but it's like, yeah, it was pretty weird.  You turn around and you just saw basically Kid Rock just throw a punch with a cigar still  in his mouth so he felt like it was like a sucker punch.  And you saw Tommy Lee just get dragged out like a punk.  Well, with Tommy, though, Tommy really understands urban slang and stuff.  You hear him talk, he's like, yo, man, I'm like, that Tommy knows what the kids are saying.  And, ugh, embarrassing yourself. 
[00:31:30]  I'm starting to get the impression that Tommy Lee's kind of just a poser.  Because then there's another video of him getting knocked out or hit pretty hard in Vegas.  People love punching Tommy Lee.  Yeah.  If you go to MTV.com, because that wasn't part of the VMAs, they actually have the video.  It started over there, E-Rock.  They have the video of Kid Rock punching Tommy Lee.  Yeah, I bet there was a big, like, commotion and people were probably freaked out until  they saw it was two white guys and realized there wasn't going to be any bullets flying. 
[00:32:00]  Well, the rappers.  Jermaine Dupree was at my table.  You could just see there was definitely a sense of relief.  It was these two idiots.  These two jackasses.  Well, the rappers are kind of laughing at white people.  Yeah.  Look at them.  What are they doing?  What are they using, fists?  Right.  That's stupid.  What's a fist?  Hey, man, were people heckling Sarah?  Someone told me.  I didn't see it, but someone said that people were heckling or someone was yelling, you're  ugly or you're not funny.  Was someone heckling her?  Not at all.  Okay, good.  Killed.  That's, first of all, she walks out. 
[00:32:30]  It's like, that is the hardest audience, like P. Diddy and 50 Cent.  These guys aren't laughing at comedians.  They find out if they won some dumb award, you know?  Yeah.  Just sitting there wondering if the camera's on them.  It's just, you know, there's like 3,000 fans that don't even know where to look and  what's going on, and she just comes out and owned it.  It was pretty cool to watch, actually.  Why won't these guys laugh at a comedian?  I don't get that.  Too cool for the room.  Too cool for the room, you think, Jeffrey?  A rock concert.  She's performing at a rock concert, and considering that, I mean, she killed, you know? 
[00:33:00]  I mean, me and Voss were just talking about how few comedians can just go out in front  of such an egotistical audience and get laughs.  It's not easy.  I'm going to have to catch one of the 80 replays of what I do.  She comes out, and there's like a cutaway of J.B. Fox, kind of like looking, not really  enjoying it, and like 10 seconds later, they cut back to him cracking up on the punchline.  It was pretty fun.  What, they're not replaying it 80 times, E-Rock? 
[00:33:30]  Nope.  Why?  Why?  They want you to go to their website or something?  Are they trying to, you know, get some web traffic?  It's part of their new re-imaging.  They don't want to annoy everybody with it.  It's too late anymore.  Everybody in the audience was wasted, by the way.  The whole front section where the fight was and all that, they were really sending a lot  of booze and people were smoking.  It was pretty ridiculous.  Whose party did you go to?  We went to Jamie Foxx at a party right at the palms. 
[00:34:00]  Did he have a piano and start singing?  He didn't get up and bring girls on stage and pour tequila down there.  All right.  You got the fun Jamie Foxx because you don't know what you're going to get.  Are you going to get the serious Jamie Foxx or the fun Jamie Foxx?  This was not the Oscar winner.  This was the, let's see.  This was the, I don't know.  This is some other award.  Yeah.  It was pretty fun.  We partied pretty late and then we all basically hung out in these ridiculous cabanas and got 
[00:34:30]  wasted and went up to the Playboy Club and gambled and looked at pretty girls.  It was awesome.  Damn.  Look at your life.  I wish I could live in the life.  But the palms was really, really fun this weekend.  That's really cool.  I fought with my girlfriend until five o'clock in the morning and then we laid there like  two wide awake rats.  Oh God.  No, really?  Did you?  Oh, Jimmy.  You just described every fight with a girl.  That's how it works. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Poor Jimmy.  It was awful.  And then I went into the living room because I was so mad and I just want, you know how you  want to just like say relieve a little tension.  And every time I was like starting, she would just walk into the living room to look for  something and it was just an enraging, awful day.  But I'm glad you had fun with Jamie Foxx at the Cabana and the Playboy Club.  I'm happy for you.  But why would you choose that moment to like get a little relief?  Because it's called escaping.  You have to just get out of there.  No, no.  But he's getting out of the room, but he's, you know. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you were getting that relief?  Yeah.  Or he was trying to.  Oh, I thought you were just like.  Was he dead in the bedroom?  Yeah.  I thought you were just getting relief from the situation.  No, no, no.  Yeah, but it wasn't working anyway.  Yeah.  What was the fight about?  I can tell you in a couple minutes.  Let me remember.  You don't even remember even though you fought until five in the morning?  Oh, yeah.  I remember.  We were at a store.  I don't want to say what store because the people are friends of the show.  But let's just say that the employee wasn't being very nice to me. 
[00:36:00]  And he wasn't doing anything that could get him fired.  He was technically giving me the right answers, but we both kind of knew what he was doing.  So I addressed him.  I wasn't.  No one yelled or anything like that.  But I was complaining to her.  And then she found a couple of positive things to say about him.  And I'm like, what are you doing?  Why even defend him?  What are you doing?  Why even defend him?  Yeah.  And then we got into a big fight.  Jesus.  Norton, as crazy as Norton is, this newfound fame is blowing his mind. 
[00:36:30]  But it's not even.  There's usually a lot of people in that store, too.  He's getting insulted by every person.  How to take the stairs down or the elevator?  Steps.  I know exactly where Jimmy was.  I always take the steps down.  And the question I had was not about the other operating system.  It was about yours.  Right.  Ah, I gotcha.  I know you don't support that.  But I'm not asking you about that.  Right.  I'm asking you about your machine.  But I was justified.  I didn't mean the guy.  I didn't yell at each other.  And I was also trying to look at a machine which would have been over $5,000. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  I wasn't going to buy it.  But I was going to look at it and maybe get the big screen.  But the floors were being cleaned.  Yeah.  So he didn't want to take me over.  Are you kidding me?  No.  It was really weird.  That's like a giant sale.  So his supervisor made him take me over.  Of course he did.  Yeah, it was terrible.  But whatever.  I mean, we thought about that.  And Jeffrey's hanging out with Jamie Foxx.  You know.  Yeah, but I'm happy for Jeff.  It's always good to know your friends are at the Playboy Club while you're laying there 
[00:37:30]  in the dark just looking up.  You know, like both people, you could feel the whites of their eyes too.  They're awake.  They're awake.  I'm itchy.  I keep getting a little itch flashes.  I just slept in two days.  Wow.  By the way, that hottest chick in the world is that Rihanna.  Dude, how?  I didn't like the song.  Umbrella?  No.  Okay, my dumb girlfriend would sit there and see.  Wait, which song does she sing?  Umbrella.  Yeah.  But my girlfriend.  Why'd you say no then?  No, I didn't say no.  Did I?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  I go, umbrella?  And you go, no.  Oh, no.  I didn't.  I meant to say yes.  Why don't you two just make believe you're not sleeping?  No, I meant to say yes.  I meant to say yes.  Oh, you said no though.  Oh.  And then I got confused.  I'm like, all right.  A complete accident.  Oh, no.  I was probably saying like, no, my girlfriend would sit in the car and she would just start  singing like, Ella, Ella, eh, eh, like that part of the chorus.  And I wanted to strangle her.  And I saw the video for Umbrella where she's dancing with the umbrella.  And it is fantastic. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  She's ridiculous.  Was she there, dude?  She's not right.  It was kind of one of those things.  I was sort of like, I was Sarah Silverman's guest because Jimmy couldn't go and I've been  going through a breakup.  So Sarah was like, let's go to Vegas while everything goes down and just get away for  a couple of days.  So Sarah comes off stage and I go backstage to get her to go sit in the audience. 
[00:39:00]  And they had like seats for us.  And just as we get to our table, like they announced Rihanna like won some award and she's  at our table.  So we were like standing.  It looked like we jumped up to kiss her, but we were just getting there to sit down.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So we looked like her posse, you know, and it was like, all right, let's just get drunk  and, you know, may I always bring party favors.  We had a great party favors.  It's not a good thing.  I'm glad to hear that.  Jeff Sarah says, hey, let's wing off to Vegas.  Go to the VMAs. 
[00:39:30]  And what were you doing, Jimmy?  Well, you know, he was giving you helpful information.  No, he wasn't.  What he was doing was telling me to go ask myself, but he was doing it in a way that I  couldn't complain, but we both knew what he was doing.  He was being lazy.  Well, and he was being more than lazy.  He was being like really, he was like letting me know that he didn't want to help me without  letting me know he didn't want to help me.  Like I knew what he was doing.  We both speak English.  We both understand subtlety.  Yet I couldn't have proved it in court.  Right, right.  Okay.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[00:40:00]  We both do.  I'm right there with you, Jimmy.  So what did she say to that though?  Because she had a disagreeing.  Oh, no, I didn't feel that fine whatsoever.  No, no, after that, I said I was so, that's why I just stood there and continually asked  him questions just to annoy him.  And she's like, yeah, he handled that pretty well.  He handled that pretty well.  I wondered if it was a crime to just bite my girlfriend's face.  I'm like, is there any way I could act like I didn't mean to do that?  But I'm glad to see that Sarah called you and said, hey, let's go to Vegas to the VMAs.  I'll get you a table and get to see Rihanna.  That's always good to hear your friends. 
[00:40:30]  Have a good night.  Hey, Ron Jeremy was there.  I can't look at him without thinking about your penis.  Yeah, that whole bit.  I know.  I can't.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Whenever Ron Jeremy comes on the TV or something like that.  Well, appears on the TV.  Yeah.  It's, I always think about Jimmy's story.  Yeah.  Very good.  That's a classic.  Thank you.  It almost ruined the weekend.  What?  Picturing you in him.  All right, Jeffrey, go to bed, will you?  Good talking, man. 
[00:41:00]  He's been partying for like two days.  Thanks for the information and stuff.  Gotta be nice.  Love you guys.  All right, buddy.  We'll see you soon, okay?  Thanks, Jeff.  All right.  All right, Jeff.  Take care, man.  Jeff Ross, everybody.  There you go.  She's partying and Jimmy's in hell.  I'm glad Sarah did well, man.  I loved it.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  She's brutal.  She says some brutal stuff.  Well, this is what she said on the VMAs, just in case you missed it.  This is so exciting.  Was that incredible?  Britney Spears, everyone.  Wow.  She is amazing. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, she is 25 years old and she's already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish  in her life.  It's mind-blowing.  And she's so grown up.  She's a mother.  You know, it's crazy.  It's weird to think that just a few years ago on this very show, she was this like sweet,  innocent little girl in slutty clothes writhing around with a python.  No, that's not nice, calling Madonna a python. 
[00:42:00]  But have you seen Britney's kids?  Oh, my God.  They are the most adorable mistakes you will ever see.  That's not bad.  That's just teasing.  She did great.  Yeah.  Actually, you could hear that crowd.  Like, that's a crowd that's not mic'd.  That's an audience that's not mic'd.  That's funny, man.  Yeah.  She did all right.  All right.  That's the Opie and Anthony Show.  877-212-O-N-A.  We're back. 
[00:42:30]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's September 11th edition.  Just trying to suck more emotion out of you today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just in case you weren't sad, we're hoping this will take some sadness out of you.  A little sadder.  You like this song, Jim?  I'm really loving this.  I like this song.  It's from Donnie Darko.  It's older now.  A few years? 
[00:43:00]  It's a bit old.  Yeah?  Right?  Is it old, old?  Is it covered then?  What?  A Duran Duran song covered.  Yeah.  Was there an upbeat, though?  Like a Rio type of?  Are you kidding me?  Play the Duran Duran version.  Are you kidding me?  I like this one a lot.  I think I knew every Duran Duran song there was.  That was a real Duran Duran fag.  Ew.  Ew.  I just used to like their harmonies.  Very good.  You know, if there's a Duran Duran song on the radio and no one's in my car, all right. 
[00:43:30]  I'll take a little peek, but I'm not going to admit it to the whole country.  They had a bunch of hits.  Two.  Which one was your favorite Duran Duran song?  Um, I like, um...  Hungry like the wolf!  No, I was more like Union of the Snake.  Oh my god.  I like...  Why Union of the Snake?  I'm kidding.  You know what snake implies? 
[00:44:00]  Um...  Mmm.  Schlong?  Union of the snakes.  Are you tired of singles bars?  Are you looking for a sure thing?  Introducing Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  Hey!

[00:45:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  You're not a tapper?  Anthony Cumia has other methods of making yourself known.  Clearing your throat can also be a good way of letting others know.  Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  You've got to jiggle the bait around or else the fish ain't going to bite.  Now in a rest stop near you.  I can just see the fun that's going to happen in the bathroom here today.  Just an excuse to, you know, play that again for everybody.  Of course.  Tim has a haircut, by the way. 
[00:45:30]  It's embarrassing.  We're all looking down.  He's a big little boy.  Tim is a grown-up 40-year-old little boy.  He's a stocky boy.  He right now should be walking around for a pair of huskies.  That's exactly what he should be doing.  I think he got the super cut special.  It's horrendous.  By the way, let it be noted so we can move on because every single instant feedback,  every phone call is saying the same thing.  It's Tears for Fears not to rant.  Oh, Tears for Fears.  Do you have that version?  Tears for Fears, Mad World, right? 
[00:46:00]  You hear that version?  All around me are familiar faces.  Oh, okay.  Born out places.  Good job.  Born out places.  Tried to live for radically erases.  Going nowhere.  Little 80s, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is 80s new wave.  Yeah.  New wave.  Yeah.  New wave.  I like the new wave.  I'm snake.  I do afternoon drive.  New wave pop.  The best of the 80s.  New wave. 
[00:46:30]  I'm snake.  Stupid new wave.  All right.  I was hooked for a while, too.  Not a guitar to be heard.  No.  It's new wave, yeah.  80s new wave, yeah.  Did you see Donnie Darko, the movie?  No, I did not see Donnie Darko.  I'm sorry.  It's either really good or it sucks.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I like it.  I watched it like three times to try to figure out if I really like it or it really sucks. 
[00:47:00]  I still haven't figured it out.  You lost a lot of credibility today, though.  You liked the Duran Duran.  I liked Duran Duran a lot.  Most people would sing along to Hungry Like the Wolf.  No, no.  Not your basic ones.  What is it again?  What?  The Union of the Snake.  Union of the Snake.  And I'm trying to think of another one.  Give us another one.  Damn.  I'm on the spot.  Well.  80s new wave, yeah.  Yeah.  It's good.  It's good.  I'm animal. 
[00:47:30]  Here's Union of the Snake.  The harmonies are very good, Duran Duran.  They have very eclectic harmonies.  Do you get it like this back in the...  No.  No?  I like ordinary world.  Cut it off before the goddamn chorus comes on you.  Oh, because that's going to make all the difference in the world.  Where'd it go?  Okay, you're right. 
[00:48:00]  This is very good.  It is pretty gay.  It's hockey, though.  What can I tell you?  That's good.  Who wouldn't like the reflex?  Oh, the reflex.  Now you're talking.  That was a big hit.  Give us some reflex.  That's a big hit.  And it's going to be working on his abs.  Let's do some reflex.  This song is giant. 
[00:48:30]  That's good.  That's.  It is new wave.  You've got to find the sign.  You don't like this song?  How can you?  No?  How can you, unless you're in a bathhouse, with a like-minded gentleman?  Well, I didn't say where I was.  Rio, however.  But it's 80s New Wave.  80s New Wave.  New Wave.  Stupid stations.  They do their 80s New Wave lunch block.  What do they call it? 
[00:49:00]  It's your 80s.  What do they call it, Iraq?  Iraq knows this stuff like I do.  Your 80s lunch hour.  Yeah.  80s New Wave lunch hour.  Here's Duran Duran.  So they got to get some guy with some dumb accent to do it.  Do Ordinary World.  That's my Duran Duran song.  That's your, like.  This one?  Yeah.  It's a little too slow.  I was into the.  Like a Peterson parasol. 
[00:49:30]  This is a little too slow.  I like the slow.  What was their James Bond theme?  Huh?  What was the James Bond theme that they did for a Bond movie?  I don't know.  That one was pretty good.  Dr. Knob?  Dr. Knob.  No, it wasn't Dr. Knob.  Bill from Waterford.  It was a new wave of AIDS.  View to a kill.  Yeah, you stepped on Bill's gray line. 
[00:50:00]  Sorry.  It just popped up on Pal Talk.  All right.  It was a new wave of AIDS.  That's 80s New Wave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, view to a kill.  That was a good one.  We're going to play every Duran Duran song?  Who gives a crap?  Piece of it.  All right.  Oh, you didn't like this?  Den, den, den, den.  I don't know if I did or not.  It's not winning me over yet.  It's from a James Bond movie. 
[00:50:30]  It's like the opening theme.  You know, Bond's like in silhouette.  And he's like naked chicks.  Remember this one?  I don't like James Bond.  I'm not a big fan either.  I like the new one.  Stupid cuts.  I've been reminded that we still haven't played Girls on Film.  Girls on Film!  Or Rio.  Or Planet Earth. 
[00:51:00]  What?  I like singing my new wave.  That's good.  Girls on Film!  That was awesome.  See?  Chee-choo, chee-choo.  Chee-choo, chee-choo, chee-choo.  See, you hear the camera?  There's a modeling shoot going on.  Girls on Film!  I feel like you're version better.  Thank you.  Walking, hunting, hunting, across the bridge at midnight.  At midnight, everybody.  That song has brilliant harmonies in it.  People are calling you Durantany, Durantany. 
[00:51:30]  Notorious is a good song, too.  You didn't even hear that.  I heard that.  It's Durantany, Durantany.  Everybody, get ready for Girls on Film.  Girls on Film!  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Come on.  Give me one Girls on Film.  Girls on Film!  See, it feels good, right?  One more, Jim.  Girls on Film! 
[00:52:00]  Yeah!  Girls on Film!  80s.  New Wave.  That's good, too.  I hate it.  A Durant, Durant block.  I hate Rio, the way it's charged.  I never liked Rio.  That weird tinkle, linkle, linkle, linkle sound, the way Rio.  Yeah, let's do some Rio.  You have the opening to it?  Oh, Rio, come on.  Come on, Eric.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  This is so 80s. 
[00:52:30]  Jesus.  Not a big fan of the Rio.  No?  Why?  I just wasn't.  I don't like the big, like, huge hits.  Someone from their cell phone.  If you text, I mean, if you instant feedback from your cell phone, you gotta give your name  so we can give you credit.  But it's someone from their cell phone.  Isn't the union of the snake called docking? 
[00:53:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then there's Pat from Philly.  And then there's Pat from Philly.  And don't take any crap from Opie.  He likes Snow Patrol.  And then he did write gay, but I didn't feel like reading that part.  He just like 80s New Wave.  Das gut.  Das gut, ja.  We played the 80s New Wave.  Hold on.  I wanted to look at Mama Corleone's funeral outfits.  Oh, wait.  That was Jill Nicolini.  Sorry.  I'm gonna got Mama Corleone. 
[00:53:30]  See, she's wearing the worst, worst outfit today.  She's in mourning.  Ah.  I don't know how we got there, but.  Hey, let's say hi to Diana.  Deanna from California.  Deanna?  Hey, guys.  Hi, what's up?  When my boyfriend was like 15, him and his friend broke into a concert at the Universal  Amphitheater, and it was Duran Duran, and he was in the bathroom, he was in the urinal,  and some fucking guy walked up behind him and grabbed his ass, and he punched him in 
[00:54:00]  the mouth.  Wait, wait, wait.  Because you had a curse, right at the part that was important.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I apologize.  That's my fault.  Your boyfriend's ass was grabbed by a guy at a Duran Duran show, and then your boyfriend  turned around and punched him in the mouth?  Yes, he punched him in the mouth, so they are all gay.  The fans, you mean?  It's ballsy, huh?  Well, what does your boyfriend look like?  I mean.  Oh, he was cute.  He was very cute.  All right, well, so maybe the man was drunk.  He was a California boy, but still, I just think it's funny.  I tease him about it all the time. 
[00:54:30]  All right, thank you.  Notorious has an annoying intro as well.  Uh, Duran Duran.  Duran Duran.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I didn't know Billy had that from him.  Oh, it doesn't.  No.  Oh, let's see.  Let's get the broad there.  80s, new wave.  That's good.  This song isn't bad, though.  What?  This song isn't bad.  The beginning, some of these, like, cliche 80s things they do in there are annoying.  Yeah, but...  Do you like Wild Boys? 
[00:55:00]  But, no, I don't like Wild Boys.  Good answer.  I don't like Wild Boys.  But this song has, again, very good harmonies.  They were able to put together harmonies that other bands weren't doing, and they sounded  really good.  You know what?  Do they still perform?  Yeah, they do, actually.  Simon Le Bon.  Simon Le Bon.  He has a...  Yeah, he's got a good voice.  You gotta give him the voice there.  Chris from L.A. again.  You must tuck your tie into your shirt when playing Duran Duran.  Is that it? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, it is new wave.  That's the European way.  It is new wave.  That's good.  So listen to these harmonies.  You don't like that?  No.  I don't hate it, but it's just, like, neat.  It's not awful.  It's just irrelevant.  I just think they did a good job.  What do I know?  And it's, like, funky.  With some horns in there.  You know who I don't like from the 80s, and I want to like them because I like Joe Elliot  so much, is I do not like Def Leppard. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  No, I've tried, dude.  I just can't.  Except for...  Pour some sugar on me.  Pour some sugar on me.  No.  Bring it on the heartache I like.  Oh, you like that one?  That's a good song.  But I like Pyromania.  Anything off that.  Oh, my God.  Def Leppard is a party record, man.  I wish I liked them.  Eh, it's a staple.  It's a staple.  Get a little hysteria going.  It is new.  That's good.  It is new.  It pop. 
[00:56:30]  New.  Party song.  That's good.  I'm animal.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right.  Enough of bringing on...  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  Hell.  We're playing some silly music.  That is fun.  It's a depressing day, so we're playing some silly nonsense.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which, I don't mind the news, by the way, showing a little patriotism, but they only show it today.  That's what's annoying.  They don't show patriotism or do anything.  They'll give away military positions.  They're not very patriotic organizations. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  That's the point we're kind of making, because tomorrow they'll go back to the same old crap  they usually do.  And they all have to broadcast from lower Manhattan with the background being the construction  site.  Yeah.  Like, that's their big thing today.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, you were talking about that cell phone thing.  Oh, God, yes.  The AT&T deal with iPhone, and I was reading in the paper.  Uh, some gentleman went on a cruise, I guess, and got back, and his bill for his iPhone 
[00:57:30]  through AT&T was over $1,200.  Wow.  Um, so, I'm like, wow, you know, I was roaming out of the country when I was in the Bahamas.  And, uh, I wonder what my bill is.  And one of the convenient, handy things on the iPhone is the fact that you can indeed check  your bill right there on your phone.  Oh, cool.  You just go to settings, phone, and, you know, things like that, and it'll check your bill. 
[00:58:00]  So, I went to check mine.  And, uh, for a month, which I already pay, I got the $100 plan, which is unlimited data.  They talk about how you get this unlimited data for, uh, $100, uh, text, all that good  stuff.  Well, my bill is $550.  Oh, wow.  For one week?  For one week, yes.  We've gone for a week.  Yeah.  The, uh, that was for the week. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Aside from the $100 for the month.  So, $450 was for one week because of data transfers over the roaming, uh, 125 of that  was when EROC decided it was a good time to send me all of my pictures that I had taken  here in the studio.  So, it was a lot of, uh, data.  But, but the thing is, there was nothing, um, and a lot of people, I've read a lot of  stuff in the message boards going, well, dummy, you know, if you read your contract, what,  if one person read their entire phone contract, I will fucking blow you. 
[00:59:00]  And even if you don't.  That's, uh, that probably didn't make it over FM.  Well.  Uh, probably didn't.  You're a bit upset.  But I said that if one person actually reads their contract.  You would be amazed.  That's what you said.  That's another way to say it.  I'd be amazed.  Let me translate.  That's good.  You would be amazed.  Anthony said, if somebody read their entire phone bill, I'd behave no differently than  normal. 
[00:59:30]  That's what he said.  That's right.  That's what you miss.  No one reads the entire contract.  Not the phone bill dummies.  I mean, I read my entire phone bill, but the contract itself on the limitations of roaming  with data charges where you can't shut off your incoming data.  It's just this odd thing where I, if I had known that just having my phone on in the  Bahamas was going to amount to a $550 phone bill, I probably would have turned it off because 
[01:00:00]  I wasn't able to make any incoming or outgoing calls.  So why the hell did I need it?  It's brilliant that they figured out how to get more money from their customers without  them knowing it.  Now, a gentleman like myself, I can suck it up and go, you know, all right, I learned.  I lived.  I learned.  I made a mistake there.  I should have shut it off or whatever.  But there are people that that is a huge hit.  You're not going to be able to pay a $550 phone bill like that. 
[01:00:30]  So they are under a class action suit right now is being filed against Apple and AT&T that  this was misleading, that the contract said that it's unlimited data and there seems to  be a problem when you're Rome and there's no warning.  That these roaming charges are gigantic.  And that's what I went through.  That is amazing if you think about it.  Yeah.  I've had other phones where I went away and went roaming and it wasn't nearly as much. 
[01:01:00]  Uh, but wow.  Oh, they are screwing up by the numbers with this thing.  AT&T and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They weren't ready.  Apparently not.  They should have been able to go with other carriers too.  With other carriers.  Why?  Why be tied up to AT&T?  Should have been able to get other Verizon or something or any other carrier.  I wonder if I, if Apple will somehow find a way to get out of it because I'm sure that 
[01:01:30]  they didn't count on AT&T just blundering everything.  They should have an option where you can, uh, pop out your SIM chip and perhaps get an  overseas one if you're going overseas or, you know, pop one of those in, but nothing.  That thing is sealed up and you get your bill and, uh, a lot of people have been calling  up saying, Hey, this is a lot more than, uh, than I thought I was going to be paying.  And they say, you know something?  Sorry.  Pay your bill. 
[01:02:00]  So I'll pay my bill, but I'm not happy.  Wait, you called and they said that?  No, somebody, uh, I was reading reports and stuff and message board stuff and they said  they called and said, this is a mistake.  I, you know, uh, it was roaming, but I have no way to shut this off.  And I didn't know incoming data.  I wasn't making any phone calls.  It's not like I was on the phone for three hours talking to somebody back in the States.  Your phone sits there and every so often it gets an email and it downloads it and you're  paying through the nose that your phone's just sitting there on charge. 
[01:02:30]  I mean, I would be pissed, but that's brilliant that the company has figured out how to get  more money out of their customers.  Yeah.  Who's going to fight it?  Cause you figure if you're paying, like there are two plans, there was a cheaper one and  then the more expensive hundred dollar plan.  So I go, I go for the hundred dollar plan.  Figure, you know, you're going to get it, everything you need.  So you're paying that hundred dollars, but now you're also paying 450 extra on top of  it.  Yeah.  It's a hundred bucks.  Let me ask you.  Like, I think I have that plan too.  Yeah.  What I, um, my bill so far as of September 11th is 167. 
[01:03:00]  How does that happen, Jimmy?  What's the 67 bucks?  Where does $67 come from when it said a hundred dollars?  This is all, uh, taxes, service charges, FICA, probably FICA is involved.  FICA.  I hate FICA.  Let's go to Bob in Florida.  Bob.  Hey there, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  I would like to have a, I would like to have a special request for relax by Frankie Goes  to Hollywood.  It is new wave.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Frankie says, relax. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Right.  And we all know what he's talking about.  Frankie says, lose a lot of weight.  Frankie says, just relax.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give it to me.  Frankie says, the test was positive.  It is new wave.  What?  Oh, Frankie's dead.  Is he?  Frankie's dead.  I don't know if he's dead.  Frankie's dead.  Frankie, I don't know if he's dead.  Frankie got the AIDS, didn't he?  That's a new band.  Frankie, I don't know if he's dead. 
[01:04:00]  Fan?  I don't think Frankie's dead.  Oh my God.  What, what, what?  Travis, our own Travis.  Yeah.  His first international phone bill was $2,800.  What?  Wowie kazowie.  Hey, that wasn't on an iPhone, was it?  Travis, take your time going to the microphone.  What service was it?  No problem.  Sorry, I'm sorry.  I guess it's all about you today.  What service was it?  We're already four minutes late and you just take your time.  It was Verizon. 
[01:04:30]  It was Verizon.  And so, wow, they still nail you.  Yeah, the first month I started talking to Lisa.  Oh, up in Canada.  I didn't, I didn't know that, uh, that long distance did not include Canada.  Yeah, but wait, you're still here in the United States and you were just calling Canada.  Mm-hmm.  And they charge you $2,800?  Yeah.  The technology's there to not have to charge that much money.  Isn't that just a regular?  That's a regular international phone call.  Yeah, Canada's regular.  Zero, zero, and that stuff. 
[01:05:00]  They get you.  Yeah.  So, what did you do?  65 cents a minute.  My dad paid it and I paid him back over 14 months.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Because they immediately shut your phone off when it's that much.  Why is it that much?  Because they have to, like, turn, like, special switches on and off.  No, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  No, they do not.  They really do.  They know you're calling another company and there's a guy that's sitting there going,  oh, boy, okay, what do I have to do?  I got to push B, C, A, I got to move this lever up, and then you talk. 
[01:05:30]  Wow, that must be a lot of lever moving.  There's a lot of people that all they do is lever moving.  You know why I say that?  Because you can pick up your phone at home and call Canada for nothing.  Yeah.  Why is it different with a cell phone?  There's, like, five different charges.  It's ridiculous.  There's just a charge.  It's, like, 65 cents a minute.  Why are they still ripping people off with cell phone charges?  Cell phones are pretty commonplace these days.  How great is it?  And there's no need.  There's none of this extra equipment that needs all this maintenance. 
[01:06:00]  No, they got to call, like, a guy in a tower.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, Travis needs to call Canada, so get ready.  And then the guy in Canada goes, all right, let me get the levers.  Okay, Travis, I'll put your call through.  Let me get all the levers situated in the right way.  What's all this about?  Who's your calling?  Oh, man.  Has the Internet exploited the cell phone companies or what?  They showed everybody how easy it is to just, you know, communicate with someone anywhere in the world. 
[01:06:30]  But the cell phone companies made it sound like it was very complicated.  Oh, it's so complicated.  It's a goddamn phone call.  Just stop it.  They're ripping everyone off.  Wasn't there a class action suit, did you say that already, against AT&T?  Yeah, yeah.  Right now there's a class action suit against AT&T because of those roaming charges on the iPhone.  Because their contract is misleading, is what the lawsuit says.  All right, we got to take a break. 
[01:07:00]  You want some more Duran Duran Ann?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Jesse has this comment.  Jesse from Arizona.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm right here.  Hold on.  What's going on?  Why did you say hold on?  Yeah.  Because I had to take it off speakerphone, man.  I'm sitting down here.  I'm in Arizona.  All right.  What do you got going on in Arizona?  About Mickey's 40, halfway through. 
[01:07:30]  Am I allowed to say that on the radio?  No, but you did.  Whatever.  I guess we'll just have to let that go through.  Yeah.  Cool.  So we were talking earlier about 9-11, right?  Yeah.  Are we still going to talk about that at all, or are we going to talk about Britney's Muffin?  This guy.  Well, we talked about Britney's Muffin as well.  Yeah.  There's only so much you could say about Britney Spears and how she looked a bit chubby on stage the other night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other thing is, too, is Verizon and AT&T are on the same towers. 
[01:08:00]  They just fuck you one way or another.  Oh, shit.  I can't say that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Worst caller ever.  Jesse.  All right.  You can't say the F word, and then to follow up the F word, you go, oh, S, I can't say that.  Yeah, it was an S.  You were saying that Verizon and AT&T are on the same tower, so they kind of screw you over.  But for me, the difference would be, and I could be wrong, but Verizon has landlines, and that makes a huge difference. 
[01:08:30]  But for whatever reason, Verizon's service is the best.  Well, I'll tell you, yesterday I was waiting to watch my NFL Sunday ticket, and I was on the phone with DirecTV for two hours trying to get that to work.  I'll tell you one thing.  There's no such thing as customer service in America anymore because we're talking to somebody in India.  Wait, you were watching your football on Monday?  Well, don't most people watch Monday night football?  I'm talking about yesterday, yesterday.  But you made it sound like you ‚Äì didn't he say NFL tickets so you would watch this, check out all the games instead of one game? 
[01:09:00]  You really meant to say on Sunday, didn't you?  But then again, it's Arizona.  Is it still Monday in Arizona?  I don't know where that timeline is.  All right.  Jesse, you know, we really gave you a shot, but you just suck.  And that was the worst.  What he just said, he goes, you know, there really is no more customer service in America.  That was the worst mass email opening I've ever heard.  George Carlin's views on customer service.  Well, let's give it to Arizona.  They do have the lakes where the chicks get naked on boats. 
[01:09:30]  Yes.  Thank you for reminding me of that, Iraq.  Spring break, things going on over there.  They do have those lakes with the chicks on the boats.  So, oh, aquatic eye candy.  I'll talk about that next.  Oh, did you get any?  I can't wait to see.  You know, because we were tooling around the bays looking for some hotties.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll explain that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Come and wrap me up.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  New bit.  I smell new bit. 
[01:10:00]  Come and wrap me up, my deus.  That's good.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  And to the idiot that doesn't get me, I keep saying, 80s New Wave, that's good.  He goes, it was funny the first 10 times enough.  I wasn't doing it to be funny.  You got to learn about me.  I do things to be obnoxious.  Obnoxious.  To annoy you.  To annoy you.  Come on, wrap me up, my deus.  Now, Falco.  Come on.  Falco's dead, right?  Uh, no.  Falco's dead.  I'm being told here that Frankie goes to Hollywood. 
[01:10:30]  Frankie there, he's still alive.  He's alive and well.  He has the AIDS, but, uh, he's, he's not only surviving, he's thriving.  He is thriving.  I'm not somebody dying of AIDS.  I'm somebody living with AIDS.  Spreading it.  It is 80s.  Spreading.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  And, uh, but while Frankie goes to Hollywood, uh, E-Rock found a band picture.  It could be the gayest band picture ever. 
[01:11:00]  That might be a new bit too.  Find a gayer picture than this one.  Gay band pictures.  Frankie goes to Hollywood.  They didn't have to be that close for the photo.  They're all back to, is that true?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Falco was hit by a bus in 1998.  Oh, that's right.  He is dead.  Is he the one to sing Amadeus?  Yeah, rock me Amadeus.  Come on and rock me Amadeus.  He's dead.  Bus got him.  Oh.  Hilarious.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  It was like a head-on collision or something in the, in the Swiss Alps, I'm gonna guess. 
[01:11:30]  Come on, rock me Amadeus.  Oh, rock me Amadeus.  Ah.  Amadeus, Amadeus.  Amadeus.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's not good.  Not good, yeah.  The bus.  So, uh, I challenge our fine listeners today.  We're looking at a band picture of Frank who goes to Hollywood.  Oof.  Jamie, why don't you look to your right there?  Oh, you rock.  That's a hot one. 
[01:12:00]  Hold on.  There you go.  They did not have to be that close to each other for the photo.  That.  Interns are doing it every morning when I walk in.  They're basically, um, hmm.  They could absolutely all, and I'm not kidding, they are close enough and in a position of  which they could absolutely be having sex with each other.  Yeah.  In that picture.  Except for the first.  All of them.  Except for the first guy in line.  Yes.  Poor fella.  Well, he's, you know.  Why, why? 
[01:12:30]  He's still having sex, but.  Yeah?  He's just not, um, getting any reciprocation.  Ah.  Unless they spin it around into a tight little circle.  I don't know.  But if they do, like, when the first guy goes to say hello to the last guy, you're going  to hear, as it splits in the middle.  You don't want to kink the slinky.  All right, we're going to, you know, it's all about 80s New Wave.  I mean, every radio station has their little, little segment where they do it.  So now we got 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:13:00]  Yes.  So.  New Wave Tuesday.  New Wave Tuesday.  It's New Wave Tuesday.  Yeah, because that's good.  Can I tell you who I have a crush on?  I have a tremendous crush on somebody.  Oh, Jimmy.  I didn't know.  It's completely true.  The mother of that missing little girl, that Kate McCann.  I swear to God.  You mean the murderess?  The murderess.  I don't know.  I don't believe she did it.  Of course you don't, because you're in love with her.  I do not believe that the parents are involved.  No?  I hope not.  Based on what?  She's so cute that way. 
[01:13:30]  She is a beautiful woman.  Really?  Doctor, yeah.  She's fantastic.  You find her very sexy, do you?  It's just, yeah.  She's really, really gorgeous.  Yeah.  Or, you know, a child killer.  All right.  Well, you know, if you want to put it like that, yes.  She's the hottest of them all.  I don't think she is.  Hey, we were talking about phones.  Before we move on, we got Mike from Illinois.  Ant's confused.  iPhone data never shuts off.  Browser is always open.  Not just for the, what?  Mail? 
[01:14:00]  What?  Yeah, I know.  His feedback fell apart at the end.  But they're saying that the data never shuts off.  So if you're in a foreign country, you're getting charged a ridiculous sum of money when  your phone is off.  Someone suggested something very convenient.  Said before you go on vacation, call AT&T and have them shut your service off.  Oh, great.  And then have them turn it back on when you get home.  That's convenient.  Because you know how easy it is, first of all, to call a cell phone company and actually  get somebody that knows what the hell they're talking about.  And not just a press one, press two, press three. 
[01:14:30]  And then turn off your service.  And then turn it back on when you, well, just leave your cell phone at home, dummy.  They know they got you.  That's why I say, once again, it's brilliant.  Yep.  It's brilliant.  Also, Mike from South Jersey, a guy left his iPhone off and they still charged him $4,800  because when it's turned off, it still checks for email updates and other S.  No.  Do you know, I'm looking at the cost of my iPhone right now.  Yeah.  And I have a $99 a month thing, 2,000 minutes.  So $99.  That's nice.  So it's just that you get a bill every month for $99. 
[01:15:00]  You could probably set it up instantly just to pay it right from your account.  Write that old check for $99.  $99, Jim.  Zero, zero, over $100.  Nope.  No.  What?  Wait, no.  Oh, no.  It says $99.  iPhone data plus UNL, it might be unlimited, $40.  But you have unlimited data.  Well, that might be part of it.  Like, I may have signed up for $139.  I could live with that.  I don't think so.  I think $100 includes the unlimited data.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Well, then I don't know what the charge...  I could be...  You didn't read your contract.  $0.30 for the wireless 911 charge.  Okay.  New York state fee.  Of course, they have to get their disgusting fingers in there.  $1.20.  And then here, I don't get this one.  Regulatory cost recovery charge.  Oh, wow.  $86.  That's to recover the regulatory cost.  The regulatory cost.  What is that?  That means that the government passed something on to the despicable phone companies, I think. 
[01:16:00]  And they have to recover it through you.  Why don't they just come to our houses, put guns in our faces, and say, hand it over?  Just give me your money.  Jimmy, you're using our phone.  Jimmy.  Give me your money.  They can't do that because we're free in this country.  Right.  We're going to build a freedom tower to show the rest of the world we're free.  I like the word freedom.  Not used enough.  They better put a cell up there.  You got tranny charges on that thing, too?  Let's hope not.  $15.99, daddy.  Tranny charge.  And then, I don't know if this is true, but we've got to say hi to Tennessee this morning. 
[01:16:30]  Supposedly, they're firing up the electric chair tonight.  First time since 1960.  Old Sparky?  Wow.  Tennessee has Old Sparky?  That's what they call it.  The electric chair, huh?  Can we get some info?  Are they firing up Old Sparky for the first time since 1960?  Oh, that's fantastic.  Don't wet the sponge.  What kind of crime do you have to commit to be the first one they kill in 47 years?  With the electric chair.  Wow.  How naughty are you?  You're a naughty boy. 
[01:17:00]  It's true.  Yeah, we got the story coming in as we speak.  And, of course, it's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Yes.  And, you know, we want to take a page from the local news and, you know, tone it down a bit  because it's the sixth anniversary of 9-11.  So, instead of the over-the-top Rock Scream sweeper slash promo, we play every Tuesday.  We have this.  Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  I'll be in Anthony.  There you go.  By the way, did anybody read about Clinton and Bob Dole pushing for a charity for 9-11  for kids of 9-11 victims to go to college? 
[01:18:00]  And this despicable Minnesota-based charity has given away, like, $19 million out of $133 million.  And, like, they want to keep what they don't give away.  Oh, really?  To do with as they will.  It was in the Post on Sunday.  We weren't here yesterday.  Not very charitable.  Oh, it's just awful how people are, like, making money off September 11th.  It's disgusting.  Let's go to Tim in Iowa.  Why is there a girl with weird hair, like, confused in the studio?  We'll get to her in a second.  Tim in Iowa, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I love you. 
[01:18:30]  Love the show.  Yeah.  Hey, I got a new wave Rock Scream Tuesday.  Well, it is Rock Scream Tuesday, and it's also officially now.  Make your changes at home.  Hopefully, Travis will make the change as well.  It's now New Wave Tuesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  80s New Wave Tuesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Go ahead, Tim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sucked.  That sucked.  New Wave Rock Scream.  I was looking for a little more there. 
[01:19:00]  But all right, Tim.  Thank you.  Why is this girl confused?  What's going on?  What's going on?  She's got coffee in her hand.  Hi.  Is this a Kenny bit?  This should be terrific.  What's going on?  Somebody wanted a coffee.  Oh.  What's your name?  Jess.  Jess?  You've been an intern.  This is your first day?  Yeah.  Cool.  Are you familiar with the show?  Not really.  How are you an intern on the show if you're not...  That's a good question. 
[01:19:30]  Well, I listen to it a couple of times, but not really.  Oh.  Wow.  What do you like to listen to?  I don't know.  Metal?  I don't really listen to talk shows.  Yeah.  I don't either.  Yeah.  Why would you?  They suck.  They do suck.  Why would you?  They suck.  Yeah.  What do you...  What's up?  You're standing here with coffee?  Yeah.  He wanted...  Somebody wanted a coffee, so...  Who's it for?  Damn. 
[01:20:00]  Who is it for?  Yeah.  Who is it for?  Are you Roland's little sister?  No, no, no.  Hey, um...  Yeah.  Who is it for?  Do you remember who I told you it was for?  No.  Wow, Steve.  I just gotta say, wow, Steve.  Come on.  Maybe she's a little nervous on the first day.  Yeah.  Come on.  Can we just give her a name?  Because we don't even know who it's for.  All right.  Would you bring the coffee to Jim, please? 
[01:20:30]  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Jim.  I'm new here.  I have no idea who anybody is.  Oh, Jimmy...  Jimmy Norton.  He's over there.  Behind the board there.  Oh, Iraq.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, so...  His real name is Iraq.  Yeah.  So...  You knew that Jim's nickname was Iraq?  Well, I assumed that was Iraq, because that was what he introduced me to.  Wait, wait.  Wait, he actually introduced himself as Iraq? 
[01:21:00]  Dude, you introduced yourself as Iraq?  No, I didn't.  Then how does she know you're Iraq?  I think Bon Jovi told her when...  Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi, of course.  Oh, Jesus.  What was that?  Jesse James said to Bon Jovi that Iraq...  All right.  Just give the coffee to Jim.  Yeah.  Jim doesn't like cold coffee.  Yeah.  We got to move on with the show.  And there she's going to give the coffee to Jim, a.k.a. D-Rock. 
[01:21:30]  What kind of sense of humor you got?  What'd you get in the coffee?  Make sure she got it right with you, with skim milk.  I'll open it.  What's in the coffee, Jess?  Oh, my God.  Regular?  It's just coffee.  And that's it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  How old a gal are you?  Huh?  How old a gal are you?  19. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, okay.  Where do you live?  Plainfield.  New Jersey.  The school for a while?  The home of Rich Voss, yeah.  Hometown of Rich Voss.  You know Rich Voss?  No.  Yeah.  Don't worry about that.  How did you come to apply?  I'm curious, because I've never done an internship.  What happened?  You're a college student?  Yeah, I graduated from IR in Manhattan, Institute of Audio Research.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was AMA.  So wait, you applied for what?  To K-Rock?  Yes. 
[01:22:30]  And who put you here?  That's a good question.  Good question.  Just say E-Rock again.  Did you interview with Steve?  Huh?  Steve?  No, Pete, I think.  I don't know.  Promotions.  Was it a big gentleman that talked like this?  Hi, I'm Steve.  I own Foundry Music.  Wait, so she's not one of ours?  Porno Pete in Promot...  Who's Porno Pete?  Guy runs promotions.  What?  Why is the promotion guy for the rock station deciding who should intern on our show? 
[01:23:00]  That I have no idea.  Wow.  Who does know?  Can we get Steve in real quick and ask him?  Don't worry.  Can Steve hear me, Kenny?  We have no problem with you.  Nothing personal.  No, no.  Oh, there.  Steve.  Don't eat on the radio.  That's something I should teach you.  Steve, why aren't you deciding who interns for the Opie and Anthony show?  Very good question, Steve.  Because you kind of know what we're looking for.  Steve, comment?  Steve?  We interviewed Jess.  Dan, Danny, and I interviewed Jess. 
[01:23:30]  And she told us that she wasn't that familiar with the show.  I said, well, tell you what.  Go home and listen to it for a week.  And if you think that you can hang with this group because, you know, the environment isn't for everybody, then let us know.  Because we were hurting for interns, as usual.  And especially in the fall when you don't have a whole lot of applicants, period.  I went to KROQ to ask them to help us out.  And she was one of the applicants we got.  And so you listened for a week?  The applicant.  Actually, I listened for two days. 
[01:24:00]  And what did you get from the show?  What did you hear?  What did you hear?  Do you remember what you heard?  I work from 10 to 10.  So.  From 10 to 10 a.m. and p.m. or p.m. to a.m.?  Hmm.  That's a tough one.  Well, of course, a.m.  No, you could be an overnight shift.  She could work from 10 to 10, meaning she doesn't work.  Or she just works 24 hours in a row.  Right, right.  I work from 10 to 9.59.  Where do you work from 10 to 10? 
[01:24:30]  Video store.  What kind of videos?  Normal videos, man.  All right.  What did you learn from the Opie and Anthony show in two days?  You're frustrating me.  Let's go.  I don't know.  One of the shows, I think it was on Thursday.  You guys were talking about hot dogs.  I was half awake, so.  Oh, my.  Well, you could easily be an on-air member.  So, wait.  All right.  In two days, he said listen for a week.  We listened for two days.  And we were talking about hot dogs. 
[01:25:00]  And what else?  Like, in two days.  Dude, I don't remember the rest.  I'm like, I was like half awake.  Yeah.  Smoke a lot of pot, don't you?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you?  No, I don't.  No, no.  I'm just not going to admit it anyway.  I know that.  All right.  Get on a national radio show and say you smoke pot.  Even though everyone knows.  Well, there may be a.  All right.  Well, something here.  We'll see.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Word. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, it's so far so good.  This is Jimmy, by the way.  That's Jimmy Norton.  He's a famous comedian.  Best-selling author.  Do you know which one is Opie?  Very good.  Which one's Anthony?  Why would you point at the Italian for Opie?  I hate when people do that.  Which one's Anthony?  So stupid.  Dude, I don't know.  I'm here.  And I'm not saying you might be stupid.  I don't know.  But it's so stupid when people.  Wow. 
[01:26:00]  When they go, all right, who's who?  You got a very Italian name, Anthony.  And you got kind of a dopey name, Opie.  It's so easy to figure out.  All right.  Who would Hitler have liked?  Who would Stalin have liked?  There you go.  If people would just take a second, they wouldn't have to ask, okay, who's who?  Who looks Italian?  Who's, okay, who's the mean one?  Oh, come on.  That should be easy.  Who's Club Soda? 
[01:26:30]  Ah.  You don't know?  No.  Who's Jess?  Boop me.  All right.  Okay.  What other people in this room, besides who's on mic, have a radio show?  Do you know which one is Than?  You know Than.  And where's Sam?  Thanks for trying, Ant.  We appreciate the effort.  Do you know who Danny is? 
[01:27:00]  Dude, okay.  I'm going to go back to work now.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you got to do next?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You can't go back to work when the host is talking to you.  What do you have to do?  What do you have to do that's more important than Anthony asking you questions?  Apparently, I'm just some guy that's sitting around.  Hey, sorry, janitor, but I've got things to take care of.  What are you doing next?  Looking up GPS to figure out where you are?  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, Jess, what do you have to do?  Yeah, what's your next thing you got to do for the show?  Matt, somebody's got to do the feedbacks. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, boy.  That's me.  Got to go do the feedbacks.  All right, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  The instant feedback?  Yeah.  So you're going to be looking at them and printing them out, seeing which one's a pertinent  to the show?  No?  Then?  We don't let them filter.  But then what is she going to do?  She just hits print.  Oh, okay.  I mean, not to tear down a wall or anything, but she'll sit back there and just hit print  a bunch of times.  There's a lot of heavy lifting here for the interns. 
[01:28:00]  How often do you have to hit print, Jess?  Every 10 minutes.  Every 10 minutes.  That's a drag, isn't it?  Oh, you were listening to Worst Of.  See, the time you were able to listen, you were listening to Worst Of, which was probably  years old.  Why?  Because the hot dog thing was...  That's only a couple months old, the hot dog thing.  That's the hot dog truck guy, I think, no?  Something like that.  All right, well, go hit print a few times.  Well, good luck, and I guarantee that...  How long are you going to be here? 
[01:28:30]  I'm not even sure either, dude.  Another hour?  Another hour.  Yeah, I'm not too sure.  Like, what motivated you to do a morning show internship?  Well, I've always listened to K-Rock, but not the morning show, so I was like, oh, okay.  So you didn't listen to a guy named Howard or anything?  You didn't listen to Howard or David Lee Roth?  Howard I used to listen to.  Oh, but now you're on XM.  You'll be gone by nine.  I don't have money to pay.  He's on XM.  That was the final straw right there.  But he's on XM now.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  He went to XM?  Who? 
[01:29:00]  Howard.  Yeah.  Roland.  It's Roland.  Do you know who Roland is?  No.  Yeah, he was just in that room.  He went away.  You know what show I'm liking these days?  Ugly Betty.  Anyone like that?  Oh, I'll be.  No, we're just moving on.  I want to talk about TV now.  Thanks, Jess.  All right, bye.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, look, her head is shaking.  Yes.  She's walking.  Oh, no.  Jimmy got her. 
[01:29:30]  What?  Yeah.  Now she's going to walk out, and all the interns are just going to laugh at her.  I am the werewolf.  Yeah, well.  I like to make werewolf movies.  That is my favorite.  Werewolf movies.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Can the instant feedback people please just write in comments about how stupid Jess is?  She won't be able to read them. 
[01:30:00]  She'll just eat them.  I don't know.  That kid doesn't seem to have good motivation.  Have you been looking at what she's been doing since we've been?  I know it's only been a couple of hours, but how's she panning out?  You know, she's an intern.  The C word.  Guys, stop.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that the instant feedback?  Yeah, that's just spelt over and over again.  Why don't we just turn off the instant feedback for a while, because nothing good is going to come out of this. 
[01:30:30]  Pull it up a little bit?  No.  Why?  Why do you have to scroll?  It's the same thing over and over again.  Oh, good.  In just many different ways.  All right, well.  That's good.  All right, well.  She's going to start cutting Jess the Mess.  No, she won't.  She'll go to hand it to Jess and not realize it's her.  Who's he?  Who's Jess?  All right, we've got to take a break.  I don't know.  Even if she doesn't know who the players are by face, that's fine.  Yeah.  But wouldn't you have listened to a show you're coming to intern for? 
[01:31:00]  I don't get it.  It's the whole slacker thing, you know?  Yeah.  If I was a young kid today, man, it would be so easy to succeed, because we just see these  kids coming through these doors over and over again, a bunch of slackers.  If you have just a little bit of motivation in this day and age, you could go right to  the top immediately.  You're a slacker McFly.  I'm just amazed at the slackers that we see come before us.  And these are the ones that are motivated to try to do something with their lives.  I think if I was told to listen to the show for a week, I'd probably listen to the show. 
[01:31:30]  I'd probably pop up the website, look, see who the basic players are.  Sure.  Who the guests usually are.  Yeah.  I would be psyched just because what if they had bands on that I liked?  Listen to some tapes of the show, recordings online.  Look at some of the videos up on YouTube.  Just get acquainted with the program.  Yeah.  That way you might get a better idea of what we need done around here.  And then before you know it, we know your name.  You're doing a good job.  And maybe you get the big hire. 
[01:32:00]  Ooh.  That's how it works.  Maybe we could play that song Rihanna's thing about her.  Dumb Bella.  Oh, God.  Oh, jeez.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh.  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  What do you think of?  What do you think of?  Wanted Dead or Alive, right? 
[01:32:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's good.  Mikaela.  Mikaela.  Mikaela, what's up?  Mikaela.  How's it going?  How's it going?  What's up?  Listen, I have one question for you.  By the way, this is the lead singer of Wanted Dead or Alive.  All I know is that's me.  You're the jack and the jack and the jack.  Oh, my God.  What's up with your intern, Jess?  Oh, my God.  She's out of her wig. 
[01:33:00]  Well, she's doing the best show.  What?  She's a little nervous.  Yeah.  So what's going on?  You're from Philly.  You're that tranny from Kid Chris's radio show, right?  Right.  And I was on yesterday, and I want to ask, when will I be able to see you when you guys  come to Philly, and how do I do this car crash thing?  Well, wow.  Well, just listen to YSP, because we have so many things planned for Philly when we broadcast  live next.  Oh, my God.  This Thursday and Friday.  Tranny for car crash, huh?  I'm asking you guys. 
[01:33:30]  Well, if you want to try out for car crash comedy, just show up at the TLA on Friday very  early on South Street, and we're going to be doing it.  We're going to have to find a comedian to open up the virus show.  Are you funny?  Saturday.  I'm definitely going to be funny.  Yeah?  I'm singing it.  You got some jokes?  Oh, yes, I do.  You're a comedian?  Comedian?  Yes.  I'm going to show that Ed McGonigal doesn't have any balls.  I don't know who that is.  You want to give us a little sample?  One little joke? 
[01:34:00]  Clean.  You really want me to?  Yeah.  Yeah, like, you know, you get up there and go.  I'm half man, half beast.  I have breasts, no balls, and I'm back so wide I can stop Mexicans from crossing the border.  All right.  I think that could definitely work.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  I'm sorry.  I'm a little off my delivery because I got a hangover, and it's so early in the morning.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Roman war helmet, whatever you want to call it. 
[01:34:30]  I got to jump in because I'm getting a request.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  He wants me to sing Thomas Dolby, one of our submarines is missing.  Thomas Dolby, it's only science.  No, no, the follow-up hit.  One of our submarines is missing.  No, he had that other follow-up hit, and that was it.  What?  That was barely.  Hyperactive?  Yeah.  Can you tell somebody on this show used to have to play this crap? 
[01:35:00]  One of my submarines is missing.  That doesn't sound like it.  That doesn't even ring a bell.  This is hyperactive.  It is New Wave.  This is the other hit.  That's good.  Thomas Dolby, hyperactive.  Yeah.  All right.  So why don't you give us a better joke there, Michaela?  I have so many of them.  So many of them.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  You have to come.  I'm going to start doing voices on this show.  I decided.  So many of them.  Do you want me to do a joke or not?  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Give us another joke.  Yes, sir.  All right.  I have one operation left.  The one where they staple a paper bag over my half-man face, half-horse face.  All right.  I mean, I...  A little self-deprecating humor.  I like that.  Definitely potential.  That's good.  Definitely potential.  Look at me.  I scare little kids.  They look at their mommy and say, how come that thing hates his parents so much? 
[01:36:00]  Hey, you're on fire.  Cool.  What else you got?  That's not bad.  The good thing about me is I can go with myself on Halloween.  Look, that guy's dressed like the ultimate warrior.  Warrior.  That's very funny.  What are you worrying about?  I'm not doing my whole set for you.  Come on.  I got to save the rest for...  Come on.  Put on your deep voice.  Yeah, let's hear how you use this.  Let's hear your man voice.  Do one.  This is it.  No, no.  Try. 
[01:36:30]  Try.  Because, like, everybody could put on a deep voice.  Go ahead.  Yeah, what would your deep voice sound like?  Hello?  There.  There.  I can't do it no more.  No more.  I have to be from my throat.  No more.  No more.  So when am I going to be able to pop in and see you guys when you guys are in our studios?  Will you promise to blow your nose before you're on the radio next?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'll come down and see you.  You guys can bash me on the air.  All right. 
[01:37:00]  How about you show up at YSP Thursday morning?  Yeah, I could do that.  All right.  And then we'll see what you're all about, all right?  Oracle Logistics out.  Yes.  All right.  Looking forward to this.  Well, that's one of us.  I'm looking forward to this, Jimmy.  I love when people do that.  That's one of us.  Who knows?  I may play with Jimmy.  Jimmy, would you play with this thing if you weren't in a relationship that's falling apart?  Even though I am in one, I would play.  What's my girlfriend going to do?  You would play with this? 
[01:37:30]  You bet I would.  Come on, Jimmy.  Let's play.  Come on, Jimmy.  Who is that besides not a proud parent?  Come on, you'll be in Philly.  You won't be in New York.  What happens in Philly stays in Philly?  What?  Yeah.  Who's calling you?  Exactly.  Who knows?  Who's calling?  Who?  Well, why don't you look at the caller ID?  You know.  Yeah.  These days, it's very easy to know.  Who's calling you? 
[01:38:00]  Look at the phone.  Who's calling you?  I'm busy.  The phone.  This is part with Jimmy.  Don't worry.  You'll have a good time with Jimmy.  I'm looking forward to it.  Me too.  All right.  I'm a hubba.  All right.  We'll see you Thursday.  Listen, for everybody in the Philly area, just keep listening to YSP for all the details  on our visit to Philly this Thursday and Friday.  And, of course, the big comedy show on Saturday, the last one of the tour.  I think we did eight or nine, something like that.  I think we did eight.  This is it.  I think we might rest this whole concept for a little while. 
[01:38:30]  So, last chance to see this tour.  How depressing is this poor guy, man, this Buffalo Bill, getting injured like that?  What?  It sucks, man.  It's unbelievable.  What is it?  Everett, right?  Yeah, man.  His name is Kevin Everett.  He's like a young guy.  And he was the first player of the season.  I think it was the first play in his NFL career.  Oh, God.  You're kidding.  And he's not out of the woods yet.  He could still die from these injuries.  They think he might be paralyzed for life.  With blood clots and stuff.  I mean, obviously, his career is over. 
[01:39:00]  First play of your career as a professional?  Those guys go in with their head down, maybe a little too far.  Crazy.  They should all slide like the quarterback.  Yeah.  I would have one play, and I'd be thrown out for being a fairy.  Mm-hmm.  It's really sad, man, because the guy is, they say he might be paralyzed.  But even if he's not paralyzed, like if he turns out to be okay, even though his career  is over, will he still have money?  Like, they'll probably have to pay him, right?  Insurance and stuff?  Yeah, I'm sure he's got insurance or something like that.  Small consolation. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, he don't give a crap.  No, no, but I mean most.  He's been working his whole life to be in the NFL.  He gets there.  First play.  I believe it's his first play.  I don't really know much about Everett.  And there you go.  He goes down.  It was a horrific hit, man.  That's really sad.  It was just awful to see.  Awful.  Speaking of football, there's some controversy here, by the way.  Keon Trevor.  These asses behind the scenes, I know what they're doing, and they're going to lose this  week, they stalled on getting the games that we were supposed to pick, and I take chances  with my football picks. 
[01:40:00]  I'm the dope that's always going for the upsets and stuff.  I took the Jets over the Pats and a few others, and I kept going to Travis and everybody.  They're all in cahoots behind the scenes.  I'm like, hey, what games are we picking this year, this week?  Because my brother's doing my picks.  Because I was way out of it last year, and I gave my picks over to brother Elmo, and  he ended up tying Travis by the end of the year.  So this year, I decided I'm just going to destroy everybody with my brother's picks.  These guys knew that. 
[01:40:30]  They stalled to the last minute knowing my brother was crashing, and I had to pick the  games.  I went like I usually do with a bunch of upsets and lost across the board.  I got two out of seven right.  Travis got six out of seven, and he's in the lead.  I got a good strategy how they won't screw you over.  What's that?  But tell them that if you win, you divvy up the money between them.  How about I'll tell them if I win, they don't get fired.  Jesus.  Yeah, keep laughing.  Because I know exactly what you did.  So enjoy your victory this week. 
[01:41:00]  But my brother's doing the football picks this week.  Did Travis have nine?  He had six out of seven.  Six out of seven.  And then Danny and Butcha are in second place with five out of seven.  How many do you have?  Only two.  Only two.  I went upset.  I said opening day.  Everyone's, they had that adrenaline thing.  Yeah.  Everyone's healthy.  I'm going for some upsets.  The football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today. 
[01:41:30]  Yes.  So when are we getting the football picks this week?  We usually do them Friday morning for everybody.  All right.  Well, I want my games Thursday morning.  Or I'm picking my own games.  Okay.  I want the games we're picking Thursday morning.  Fair enough.  You're not getting around this one.  I'll just make my brother stay up for once.  Okay.  Thursday morning.  Thursday morning. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Do you cut your brother in on any of the action?  No.  No.  No.  Why would I do that?  We already gave the t-shirt business.  I mean, come on.  Go to Vegas.  Learn the t-shirt business.  Right.  Hey, speaking of brothers, Brother Brett there, you know, the owner of FH Riley's, he's now  a married man.  Yes.  The Curry Lynn.  The wedding was Sunday, hence the day off yesterday.  How did that go?  Well, everyone's asking about the bachelor party.  We threw a bachelor party Friday at FH. 
[01:42:30]  It was just, wow.  It looked just like a regular night at FH Riley's to me.  It looked...  Anthony showed up.  It didn't even look like a regular night, because a regular night for me is going there  and having, you know, a bunch of animals in there, and there's maybe karaoke or a band  or something.  This was patrons eating.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  There were a few, you know, people that I knew from message boards and pal talk and  stuff, but for the most part, it was like, where is everybody? 
[01:43:00]  We had fun.  But then my brother, Elmo...  By the way, someone came up with a great idea.  Brother Elmo will pick every game, and then I'll just wait for the ones they pick, and then  I'll have the seven picks ahead of time.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to get around here.  Crap.  So he'll pick every game, and then whatever seven games we're supposed to pick, I'll use  those seven.  But it's a brother, Elmo's at FH Riley's, and around 10.05, he goes, good news, I could  get two girls here at FH Riley's.  Now, we've got some problems, because the restaurant next to us wants to take us over, so they're just 
[01:43:30]  waiting for us to F up.  They're just waiting for us to F up, and we know.  We're on to you guys.  We're on to you.  They've got little spies and stuff.  I'm like, first of all, we're not going to have nudity in the establishment.  That's just a problem waiting to happen.  And then the other thing, Brother Elmo goes, it's 10.05, I could get them here by 11.  And I think you might have said that.  We're sitting there going, what kind of girl do you think you could get on an hour's notice 
[01:44:00]  on a Friday night?  On a Friday, which is a big stripper night.  Who are you getting?  Right, all the hot girls that work the bachelor parties and the strip clubs, they're busy.  They're busy.  So what kind of mess is going to walk in at 11, because she's not busy on a Friday night?  That's what I wanted to see, though.  I wanted to see a disaster come in.  Yeah?  Oh, they're so much better than the good ones.  That makes it more memorable.  Well...  You go, oh, did you see that mess?  Well, the bachelor party ended at, for me anyway, at a whopping 12.15. 
[01:44:30]  I was tired from a week of radio, so it was obvious that nothing was going on.  Even my brother Brett, as he was doing a shot, he goes, yeah, I'm going to make it an early  night.  But I saw him do the shot, and I looked at his eyes, and I went, oh boy, he's in.  He's all in now.  Oh, oh.  Because he was under control, a couple beers, no big deal.  I got a lot to do for the wedding.  I'm going home early, but then he did the shot with some of the pests, and I looked  at him like, oh, all in. 
[01:45:00]  And sure enough, I think he was out till 4.30 in the morning, went to the carousel there  in Huntington.  Ah, yes.  I got a return pipe getting a little local for the Long Islanders.  And of course, they had to go with the humiliation.  He had to be on stage, handcuffed to a chair, supposedly completely naked.  I haven't gotten to the bottom of that one yet.  But he's like, I was so embarrassed.  My man boobs are sticking out.  I'm naked.  There's other guys in the place, because they're there just to see strippers. 
[01:45:30]  The girls are just pouring alcohol all over his body.  And then at 4.30 in the morning, he calls his, well, Carrie Lynn, who's now his wife,  and is like, all he would talk about is how hot the women were to the woman he was marrying.  That's not good.  A mere day later, and he's like asking her how you get cheap perfume out of your clothes.  I swear to God.  Stripper stench.  And then the big fishing trip, I go out there with my other brother, to meet my other brother. 
[01:46:00]  Why are you yawning a lot today?  Are you all right there?  Yeah.  My sleep is all screwed up.  I'm trying not to yawn on Mike, but it just happens.  They noticed on instant feedback.  That's why.  On instant feedback?  Yeah.  Throughout the show, you could hear.  They're probably watching on Pal Talk, too.  Oh, Pal Talk postures.  Creepy watchers.  Yeah.  Stop watching me.  So then we, it's the big fishing trip on Saturday morning, because, you know, then you got my  brother Scott, also known as Indy, for whatever reason, I don't know, because I guess he's 
[01:46:30]  an explorer.  A father with four kids, he's an explorer.  Oh, okay.  So his nickname's Indy.  He got this nice boat trip together for everybody.  Yeah, but this was something that we were talking about before the weekend.  Right.  It was either the bachelor party or the boat trip.  Right.  Because you figure you can't do both.  You're out until four in the morning, a party in for a bachelor party, and then we all know  fishing boats leave early.  So did your brother make it? 
[01:47:00]  Well, no, he did not, because he was up until 4.30, and as we're pulling out, we get a call  from Brett that he is going to make it.  He didn't make it at first.  So my brother's like, why don't we just go out and, you know, catch some blues, and then  we'll come back and pick him up, you know, in between looking for the aquatic eye camp.  Right.  All the babes that are out there in the fishing area.  There were just so many.  But the one thing about my brother, he knows the bays so well, we were just following the  birds, and then blues were jumping all over the place. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I thought the birds led you to the babes.  No, unfortunately not.  But they led you to the blue fish jumping all over the place.  The blues.  What time is this down, by the way?  What time is this?  I was there by 9 in the morning.  Mm-hmm.  9 in the morning.  I don't know.  Why are they such early risers?  So we were catching, you know, two or three pound blue fish.  You've got to call them mini blues at that point, right?  But we were having fun, waiting for my brother to get there.  And all of a sudden, my brother, Scott, he gets a big hit. 
[01:48:00]  He's like, oh, my God, I got a big hit.  I think I got something big.  It was a much bigger hit than what we were getting, you know?  Just getting under the boat.  So he's like, he's trying to reel it in.  Like, yeah, he's catching a freaking swordfish or something.  And the pole is bent.  And it looks like it's going to snap.  And he's like, oh, my God, this is big.  This is rare for the base.  My God.  And he's reeling it in, reeling it in.  And then me and my brother noticed that all the birds have scattered at this point.  All right?  They were all over the blue fish as they're jumping out of the water.  But now all the birds have scattered except for one lonely bird. 
[01:48:30]  One lonely bird that looked like he was struggling a little bit.  Oh, no.  So, yes, my brother caught a ‚Äì I'll just call it a seagull.  But, you know, he's a marine biologist.  So he explained to me it wasn't a seagull because of this and that.  But it looked to me like a seagull.  So let's just go with a seagull.  And the thing was injured in the water.  And he's reeling in a seagull. 
[01:49:00]  And me and my brother, Quinn, who also works in Manhattan, we're looking at each other like, what is he going to do?  What is he going to do?  Yeah.  How do you deal with that?  How do you deal with a seagull that ate your lure?  Fish are ridiculous.  You can just rip hooks out of their throat.  And they're like, just put me back in the water.  I'll be fine.  I have no feelings.  That's okay.  I'll be out of my ‚Äì  You've ripped out half of my esophagus.  I'll feed myself using the right side of my little fish claw.  I'll suck it in my gills.  They don't give a crap.  You're right.  But a seagull, you hear the crying as my brother's reeling it into the boat. 
[01:49:30]  Did he eat it or was he just hooked?  Huh?  He ate it, I guess.  He went down thinking it was a blue and he got a little lure in his mouth.  Oh, no.  So me and my brother, Quinn, who, like I said, work in Manhattan, we have a different way of looking at things.  My brother's a marine biologist into nature.  He works on the water.  So me and Quinn look at each other like, he's not bringing this onto the boat.  And I whisper to Quinn, I'm like, what would you do?  And he goes, exactly what you would do, just cut the line and just kind of drive the boat away and just whistle a happy tune and make believe it. 
[01:50:00]  Just make it go away.  Don't look back.  Just make it go away.  That's what I would do.  Just make it go away.  But, of course, Scott has to turn into Survivor Man, which is much cooler than Man vs. Wild.  That's why I used that reference.  Of course.  Because everyone knows Man vs. Wild.  That guy's a hack now compared to Survivor Man, which is a much better show, but not as exciting because it's only one camera. 
[01:50:30]  But anyway, so Scott decides to bring the seagull onto the boat.  It's hooked pretty good.  I'm like, what the hell?  Wings flapping.  Yeah, and he's like, help me hold the bird down.  I'm like, yeah, right.  I'm not holding no freaking seagull.  Got mites.  Right.  I bet it had feather mites.  Dude, I don't want feather mites.  The wingspan was easily three to four feet, probably closer to four feet.  This thing was huge, and it's flapping around like crazy, entering itself. 
[01:51:00]  My brother holds it down with a wet towel, gets the wings held down, but now the bird wants to bite him.  Then he holds down the mouth, and then he wants me to kind of hold the freaking jaw open.  I'm like, no.  Please tell me that it was held it down, and then he just started punching it and scolding it for wrecking your dick.  And I'm like, no.  But then he was able to figure out how to hold this damn thing down and get the hook out. 
[01:51:30]  He got it out?  Yeah.  And then petted it a couple times and let it go, and all of a sudden it tried to fly, and then it hit the water really hard.  Because it was a little dazed and confused, and then all of a sudden it got up and flew away.  You see, what a guy.  What a guy's right, because like I said, I would have just cut the line and make believe it wasn't happening.  That bird would have a foot mark in it.  Yeah.  Wrecking my lure.  And then we met up with Brett.  We went back to the doc.  We picked him up and his drunk friend, Paige, who's just a raging alcoholic, and went bluefishing. 
[01:52:00]  And thanks to Paige's puking, we had a lot of chum in the water.  Chum.  They love the vomit.  He was puking, and the bluefish were a-coming because of the puke.  Was he hung over, Paige?  Oh, my God.  I guess he got a blue on the line, and he couldn't deal with it because he was so hungover.  He just let the bluefish do its thing as he's just puking over the side of the boat.  Were you laughing at him?  Of course. 
[01:52:30]  You got it.  It's the worst, man.  You know how crappy you feel in that situation?  Then people laughing at you.  Hey, you want a sandwich?  Was he miserable, or was he kind of laughing about it?  He knows how to drink.  So if you know how to drink, you just deal with that crap, I guess.  I'd be miserable.  I wouldn't be on the boat.  But they're just troopers.  My brother was there.  He was relatively fine after a Red Bull.  Catching a seagull.  Bill from Waterford.  Perfect story for a new wave Tuesday. 
[01:53:00]  Damn the flock of seagulls.  Little flock of seagulls going into break for 80s new wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony  show.  So I guess that's it as far as the old wedding and bachelor party go.  No babes, though, huh?  Everyone was asking for the, we got a promo to do for cash4gold.com.  Did the chicks ever show up that Elmo got?  We said no.  It's stupid.  Oh, you said don't bring him.  Okay.  And then no babes on the boat.  No. 
[01:53:30]  Actually, we saw one girl kind of topless on this massive boat, but she covered up.  My brother's such a creep.  It's hilarious.  He knows how to sneak up on boats.  Stealth boat?  Yeah.  You have to sneak up quickly.  Rowing.  He has a feel for where they are, and there's a few places they do hang.  And then there was one.  She was sunbathing nude.  He's like, oh, I got to go all the way around.  I don't know, to the stern side or something.  I don't know.  Whatever the hell he says.  And then stern side.  But he knows how to sneak up on them, and they cover up real fast. 
[01:54:00]  And that was it for the aquatic eye candy.  We almost saw a boobie.  Almost a boobie.  Great.  We almost saw a boobie.  What a success.  Well, more than that was at the bachelor party, so.  Yeah.  All right.  We got, what's his name?  We got Stifler here?  Yep.  He's ready to go.  Can we just call him Stifler the whole time?  Well.  Or do we have to have a real name?  He has a real name.  What's his real name?  Sean William Scott.  What?  Sean William Scott.  I knew that.  I just wanted you to say that. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  I'd like to say Stifler, though.  Yeah.  Sean William Scott, after the break, promoting Mr. Woodcock.  Mr. Woodcock.  Mr. Woodcock in theaters this Friday.  Billy Bob Thornton is Mr. Woodcock.  You know, George Washington's false teeth.  Yes.  What?  I just said yes, so it wouldn't go any further.  It wouldn't have.

I am in the goddamn right here.  5-8-7-7  It's spelled!  It's a phone number, not a phone word.  Hey, what's your phone word?  Hey, you're a hot-looking tomato.  Can I have your phone word?  It's called a phone number.  I want to welcome Cash for Gold to our fine, fine radio show.

[02:01:00]  He's like, what the F did I walk into?  It's 80's New Wave, what?  Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  We pick stupid things to do on days so we can be more like a real radio show that has  like something Tuesday, but our stuff always sucks.  Yeah, we're just trying to be different there, Stifler.  Stifler.  Stifler.  You guys were so quiet when I walked in.  I thought I walked into something weird.  No, we were just getting ready to come back on the radio, and you walked in and went, 
[02:01:30]  uh, this is kind of awkward.  You guys were zipping up your pants.  Three men just doing a little comparing.  We were supposed to have you in at least 10, 15 minutes ago, but Anthony kind of had a  problem with reading, so.  This stupid commercial read thing.  Eh, who doesn't?  With the stupid spelling out of a phone number.  What idiot would do that?  Like, it's a phone number on a piece of paper.  You know, call us at whatever number, and they spell out the number eight, E-I-G-H-T.  Who's used to looking at that and reading a phone number? 
[02:02:00]  Well, because you need the cadence of reading the phone number.  Right.  Which you can't get if it's spelled out for you.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Right, right.  Everyone knows that.  And I try.  I reel through it, and I try, like, you know, eight, eight, three, nine, blah, blah, I'm screwed.  We get, uh, Sean, when every guest comes in, we get, like, a list of things that they've  done.  And, uh, I just want to point out to our crack staff, he told People Magazine in 2003 that  he rarely wears underwear. 
[02:02:30]  I said, what?  They say, I rarely wear underwear.  They said, this is one of the things we have.  He told People Magazine, meaning you told People Magazine in 2003 that he rarely wears underwear.  Who would say that to People Magazine?  No.  That was great.  No.  I do wear underwear, and, uh.  But see, the.  I was in stripes, I think.  I rarely wear underwear.  When I do, it's usually something sexy.  But the point we're trying to make, I mean, you're a big movie star now, and that's what  we got on you.  That's all I got.  Some quote that you might have said in 2003 to People Magazine. 
[02:03:00]  I might as well go with it then.  You might have even said it as a joke to them or something, and they printed it, but who wrote  this stuff?  I want to know who pulled this.  Sam, where'd you get that fact from?  Who culled this information?  It's valuable.  Well, I guess Sam thinks it's important to point out that he doesn't wear underwear.  Ooh, Sam.  That's why it's so quiet in the room.  We were trying to see which side you were leaning to.  Sam.  There's not, like, a lot of dirt on him.  It's just.  Well, we don't necessarily want dirt.  We don't want them uncomfortable in here.  I was looking for fun facts that could add. 
[02:03:30]  That's a fun fact.  That's really fun.  It said that on Wikipedia.  Do you do your own underwear shopping?  We were just talking about that last week.  Do I do my own?  Yeah.  And I'll ask, what am I trying to say?  No, we were talking about this last week on the show, where you can't go and just buy  underpants anymore.  You have to go through the homoerotic adventure that is shopping for underwear with the boxes  and these things on the box.  If you want anything better than, like, Fruit of the Blooms, you've got to get the separate 
[02:04:00]  box that's in the section at whatever department store you're at.  And it's just all these buff men in their underwear on the box.  And you have to decide which one you would look good in.  Which buff guy?  And if you actually know you're that guy, actually looking at, like, the cut of the  underwear, and then everybody's watching you look at the box, you're like, oh, okay.  Yeah, oh, okay, this is the guy.  Fruit of the Blooms are fine.  I think I'm as hot as that guy, so I've got to get that one.  This one will show my abs more.  He's fat. 
[02:04:30]  He's got his shape.  Just one underwear.  So you've got to go with your chick so she can pick them out and you can go, my girlfriend  is buying my underwear.  Yeah.  What about you?  Chick, what are you doing?  Girl?  Wife?  What do you got?  What are you doing?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Single guy so you just play the field.  I play the field.  That's pretty good.  Guy in your situation.  Nice.  I kind of have to.  Sometimes you see young guys that will come in here and they've been in the movies a  while and you see that ring just glowing and you go, ooh, you idiot. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, you stupid.  And the next time they're on the show, that ring's not there.  Ring's gone.  Figure it out.  Figure it out.  Screw that.  Ain't there money?  No, no, no.  I'm single.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many years ago did you do the first American Pie?  Because you've done some really massive hits, man.  Well, we did American Pie in 99.  And then after we filmed it, I didn't make any money on the film because I was only supposed  to be in two scenes.  And so afterwards, I got a job because I was waiting for the film to come out. 
[02:05:30]  So I got a job at a law firm.  I was actually not a lawyer, but I was cleaning toilets and stuff and fixing toilets because  I used to work at Home Depot.  So then after that, I was waiting for American Pie to come out.  Then I worked at the L.A. Zoo because my buddy was like, hey, if you like animals and  stuff, I get your job feeding animals.  I'm like, awesome.  I'd rather be an actor, but hopefully this American Pie film will do well.  So I get the job and this lady, kind of like Gilbert Grape, just huge woman, gives me the 
[02:06:00]  outfit and stuff and she's walking over to the food stand.  And I'm thinking, where's the little cart with the animal feed?  And she goes, okay, this is your food stand.  Let me show you how to make the churros.  I said, no, I thought I'm feeding the animals.  Oh, no.  Literally, the first day that I worked at the L.A. Zoo, I had an interview with Rolling  Stone because they're doing a big piece on American Pie.  And then so I worked there for like a week selling churros, dude.  And then you weren't feeding animals.  You were feeding the animals that actually come to the zoo.  Exactly.  And then the American Pie came out two months later. 
[02:06:30]  Thank God.  And then all of a sudden you started wearing the animals for a coat.  And like, damn, that sucks.  How was Home Depot to work for?  Well, I was a cart pusher for about eight months.  I was that guy rounding up the carts, angry out there, smashing the carts in the car.  So I feel like eight months, the guy came in.  He goes, hey, Sean, we've been seeing how hard you've been working.  We're going to promote you.  You're going to be a plumber.  I was like, wow.  That's like an awesome thing.  I said, I don't know anything about plumbing.  He goes, no, no, don't worry about it. 
[02:07:00]  He's like, we'll give you a couple of lessons.  Next day, I have an orange apron on and I'm in the plumbing department.  If you notice when you're in a Home Depot, nobody does anything there.  Everybody's walking around.  I know.  And that's the thing.  It's like, you just walk around, make it seem like you're busy.  And they're like, yeah, I'll be right with you.  Ryan in aisle five can help you out.  I would spend eight hours a day just walking.  Just avoiding people.  Yep.  I could never get help there if I need to talk to someone.  Because I don't like long, protracted conversations with people at stores.  I know what I want. 
[02:07:30]  I just need to know where it is, especially in a big place like that.  So I'm looking at the guy in the apron.  And he's talking to some guy that wants every bit of information on how the screw was turned  at the factory and what.  So I'm just sitting there going, sir, one minute, sir.  One minute.  Like, I'm not.  They're angry too, right?  Everyone's pissed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you also have like two lifers there.  They have the tool belts and they're like really serious.  They had all this stuff and they kind of like being there, but they're also angry.  Everybody's angry there.  And you're just there because you want to buy some pot. 
[02:08:00]  You just want to get through your day.  So how did you get into acting from just like being a working Joe?  Oh, can I tell everybody?  Oh, you know.  Well, it's another fun fact from Sam.  I try not to read those.  He used to work in a movie theater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's a difference between working in a movie theater and being on the screen.  All right, here it is.  Yeah, the casting directors don't hang out.  Here's the fun fact, though.  He became inspired to be a movie star after working in a movie theater and watching all 
[02:08:30]  the movies for free.  Again.  You could look.  That's not quite right.  Sam, come on.  Sam, you suck.  Wikipedia sucks.  He drove by a Lowe's once and Ted Lowe's saw him and hired him.  That's awful.  What movie did you see?  Like there had to be one thing you saw that you was like, that's like what I got to do.  Like what character in a movie or what movie like really you're like, I have to be that.  I know my brother was one of the guys that when they started the Onion newspaper in Wisconsin,  like he was, his buddy started it and then he kind of came on and started writing articles 
[02:09:00]  and stuff.  And so he inspired me and he was like a film theory major.  But I never thought about doing comedies because like I could never tell a joke in high school.  All the funny guys ended up getting the chicks.  I hated those guys.  So when I, like I ended up, I kind of wanted to do dramas.  And there wasn't really a film.  I think it was just, I was going to play baseball in Minnesota.  I just thought, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.  Hey, I'll be an actor.  So I moved out to L.A.  I had no idea that you had to audition for things.  I thought when you get an agent, you know, like a sports agent. 
[02:09:30]  They get you jobs.  I'm like, yeah, I'm like, what am I working with Tom Cruise here?  They're like, no, dude, you're auditioning for Baywatch.  I was like, audition?  What are you talking about?  Audition.  Baywatch?  I can't even swim.  Were you training?  That's like the Home Depot job.  It's like, yeah, this sucks.  Just make believe you're going in the water the whole time.  Or he's the only guy like on the beach with an apron and a piece of lumber.  Right.  Wait, so were you like a trained actor or did you just kind of like, just like say, look,  I'm going to try this and just go out and start auditioning?  Yeah, I didn't know anything.  Yeah.  I loved movies, though.  I mean, that was my only thing is I was obsessed with films and then I moved out to LA and I 
[02:10:00]  guess the only like training was just kind of auditioning, you know, and I tried to go  to some classes and stuff, but I remember when I was doing America Pie, I literally thought  I was like, I'm going to get fired from this movie because I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know anything.  I was working at Home Depot when I got the job.  I still call Home Depot and say, man, just keep that spot for me because you don't know  how long it's going to last.  You never know, man.  Yeah, I had no idea what I was doing.  I still don't.  Did you start in an Aerosmith video?  Is that true?  Yeah, I was on there for like one second, but they say that I was starring. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that's what they...  Yeah, yeah.  They'll do that.  Yeah.  They'll do that.  Well, that's also...  We'll have people come in and it's like, wow, this guy was acting with Robert De Niro.  Then you find out he was like, was an extra, you know, in a coffee shop or something.  Right.  There's the one guy from Lost, what the hell's his name, that was in Cryin'.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And they show him like, he's the guy that steals a purse and runs out and you're looking  like, oh, yeah, that is him for two seconds and just blurrily running. 
[02:11:00]  I actually do remember him in that video, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, who were you?  I hit that long hair, yeah.  Who were you in the video?  I was a guy who threw a football and hit...  I mean, like, literally, it was just like two seconds and I just threw a football at this  kid and hit him in the head with it.  That's pretty much it, dude.  We should have had a better story.  And that was the start.  Yeah.  Mr. Woodcock opens Friday.  Mr. Woodcock.  With Billy Bob Thornton, right?  The name alone.  Yeah, that's the only reason why I did it.  My mom's this really great, like, you know, Christian lady and all our friends are... 
[02:11:30]  Like, they gotta go watch, like, American Pie.  Like, my mom didn't know that American Pie was rowdy, so she took all her church friends  to see the film.  That sounds very wholesome.  Yeah, you know, they were a little appalled when I was drinking semen and beer and stuff.  She was a little freaked out.  So this movie, like, her friends are like, so what is your son doing next?  She's gotta go, Mr. Woodcock.  And they're like, I'm sorry, Mr. Woodcock?  And they're like, oh, what is it about?  She goes, I have no idea.  And she's like, it's just like, I just wanted to do it just to make her feel really awkward, 
[02:12:00]  you know?  But we don't want to see it then.  No, it's the guy's name.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just his name.  So what is it, apparently, a gym teacher type guy?  Yeah, he's that angry gym teacher.  And all the kids that had him for a teacher have not done anything with their lives.  And my character graduates school and decides to write this self-help book.  And he's like this big success.  And he goes home and finds out that Woodcock is hooking up with his mom, Susan Sarandon.  So it's just kind of a big crazy comedy.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Woodcock. 
[02:12:30]  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  That's a little meet the parents-ish.  If you like Bad Santa, his character's pretty good.  Yeah, Billy Bob Thornton's good.  He's a great guy.  Please tell me all you did was say pro-Bush stuff around Susan Sarandon.  People are angry.  I really just do talk politics around her.  Or like, how great would it be just to work with Billy Bob Thornton, but do nothing but  like talk like he was in Sling Blade?  Oh, the Sling Blade.  I'll do it again, just for another minute.  All right, shut up.  Bill K. from Philly.  Heyo, from Sean's Wikipedia, Scott has an interest in body modification. 
[02:13:00]  What does that mean?  What?  Body modification.  I see you got a tad, but I mean, that's not like body modification, isn't that?  Stretching the earlobes and stuff.  Yeah, those guys that get like those weird, like they'll actually, there are guys that  will get like not only tattooed up, but they have like-  The stud things, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Under the skin and all that.  It's weird.  Awful.  What the hell is with your Wikipedia?  Man, don't believe that stuff.  I know.  I'm going to go on there and just create all this really fun stuff.  No, our listeners could do it.  Some people do.  I know.  You better check it after this interview. 
[02:13:30]  We have a very active audience.  When you first like, I guess your first big movie was American Pie?  Yeah.  Did you like go to IMDb and go like, yeah, there I am?  It took me a while before I even realized that there's such a thing as IMDb.  Like I honestly, I was just hoping to keep getting, you know, film side.  Something, yeah.  I was like, dude, I want to go back to-  Because I also worked at California Pizza Kitchen as a host.  And I worked at Scientific Revolution. 
[02:14:00]  I was selling Glow in the Dark Star.  So I was like, man, I got to make it as an actor, dude.  These other jobs suck.  Yeah, working for a living really blows, man.  You had every job in the mall.  Yeah, I was a paper boy.  Yeah.  You're a good looking guy anyway, so I'm sure you met girls.  But what was the first like real like piece of ass you got from that movie?  Like there had to be one.  I mean, that's a massive hit.  The step up from the girls you get at Home Depot and the ones you get from being in a hit movie.  It's a different caliber. 
[02:14:30]  Like what was the first one where you're like, wow, that's simply because of that film.  You know what?  Actually, when we filmed Road Trip, it was in Atlanta, Georgia, and then American Pie just came out.  And then, man, that's when Jack Daniels and I became good friends.  And we had a ball filming that.  And also the girls are so hot down there.  So that's when I realized, I'm like, man, these girls never talked to me before this film.  So I realized, like, oh, this is awesome.  You know, I just wanted to be in a movie.  I didn't realize all these cool things were going to happen with it.  But I would say then.  I don't really know her name.  She was awesome.  You shouldn't.  How fantastic is that?  Why would I?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:15:00]  Why would I?  Your name was back of head number three.  People call you Stifler all the time.  I don't know.  Actually, sometimes now people know my name.  Yeah.  For a while, no one knew your name.  It was like, they knew the name but didn't know who it belonged to.  That name sounds familiar.  Right, right.  You know, Stifler.  Oh, okay.  Stifler, yeah, sure.  No, I do get it quite a bit.  I'm glad.  Well, the character was so great and the name was just as good.  It was fun.  You ever hear from, what's her name there with the red hair? 
[02:15:30]  What's her name?  She kind of, pantalone or something like that.  Yeah.  She kind of lost her mind for a while there.  Oh, Natasha Lyonne.  Yeah, Natasha Lyonne.  I haven't seen her.  No, really?  Yeah.  Heard some great stories about her ripping up an apartment or two.  Yeah, who hasn't done that?  I know.  I know.  And then they're like, oh, she's crazy.  She's in a hospital.  She weighs 10 pounds.  It's like, what?  What?  I think I see her outside.  I saw her in, I guess, Pee Wee's Playhouse.  She was one of the little kids in Pee Wee's Playhouse. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, really?  I'm watching one of the reruns and going, Jesus Christ, that girl looks familiar.  It's like, holy jeez, it is her.  That in Cowboy Curtis was like Larry Fishburne.  That's right.  He was in that, right?  Yeah.  Lawrence Fishburne, he comes in the door in a cowboy outfit.  Hey there, Pee Wee.  It's like, what's Lawrence Fishburne?  Jesus Christ, what's he doing?  That's after Apocalypse Now.  Yeah, true.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a, oh, I was going to ask a question, I forgot it.  You suck on the radio. 
[02:16:30]  I do.  This was a really good stage.  This was a really good interview, right?  Hey, yeah, it is.  Hey, did you guys see the Britney Spears thing?  Did you guys talk about it?  Oh, yeah.  Let's talk about it.  She was really inspiring.  What is going on with that?  How awesome is that?  It's the end of her career.  It rules.  That's it right there.  It's like watching a disaster in the making, man.  I love watching Trainwrecks, so it was great.  The lip syncing, she's always sucked at the lip syncing, but it didn't matter because she  was so incredibly hot.  And in this one, you're just trying to figure out what's going on with the body. 
[02:17:00]  Like, one angle, it didn't look bad, but then another one, it's like she's got a potbelly.  And then when they hoisted her up on the platform with a close-up on her ass, it's like, whoa,  that's not working, man.  Did you see the looks on everybody's faces?  Yeah, yeah.  That's 50 Cent.  And then they just started, yeah, everybody's looking like this.  So then they just started going to a couple of the brothers because it's like, damn that  ass.  Yeah.  Like, all right, don't go to any of the white guys.  Right where I want it.  They went to a comedian. 
[02:17:30]  We just had him on the phone before, Jeff Ross.  And he made a face that was just like, ugh.  Like when you just pass by a wreck and see blood and one of those yellow blankets pulled  over somebody.  Oh, geez.  Oh.  Yeah, she, that was a career ender, I think, right there.  Stopped lip syncing.  She barely danced.  That was that scene.  That was in the outfit she was supposed to wear.  MTV, like, actually gave her something that would cover up some of that hurt.  Oh.  And she said it wasn't sexy enough and that was her own clothes.  No way. 
[02:18:00]  They really should have taken their advice.  That's so weird, huh?  I don't like that.  Like, why?  Yeah, why would you do that?  Like, you just, that's her comeback?  She just stopped listening to people around her, man.  That was like the Paula Abdul thing.  Remember that one year she came out on MTV and people hadn't seen her in years and she  did this thing.  She was in this little number and she was pretty hefty.  You know what, I say all this, I say all this, but you know, I'll be in rehab for pills.  All right.  My comeback will be American Pie 12.  I'll be terrible. 
[02:18:30]  I won't be funny.  The character sucks.  And you guys will be talking about me.  What the hell?  He's like 280 pounds.  Don't even look like him anymore.  We had him on our show once.  We had it together.  Let's talk a crap about Britney Spears.  Now look at him.  Now look at him.  I know.  People love slinging crap at each other.  And the fight, though, right?  There's a fight between people.  Yeah.  It's not really a fight, though.  No, not really.  The rap guys were laughing at us.  At Whitey.  Yeah.  What the hell?  You're not shooting anybody?  Punch it. 
[02:19:00]  Punch it.  Get a knife out or something.  Right, right.  Exactly.  I'm wanting somebody to get knifed here.  You kind of look at Justin Timberlake.  You hosted the award show with him.  How great is it?  Like, he got Britney.  All he does, he just bangs them, and before they get awful, he leaves.  He's gone.  He's fantastic.  What did I say about JT?  I mean, why is he doing that to these girls?  Yeah, he's ruining them.  Yeah, he's ruining them.  I don't know, man.  He must be a good lay.  I want to wear his underwear.  Right.  Sam, anything?  Comment?  Go check his Wikipedia. 
[02:19:30]  Have you seen any of the, like, straight-to-video American pies and things that keep the French  guys going?  Sadly, dude, I actually watched, like, a half hour of one.  Yeah.  And it felt really weird.  It must.  I was like, why am I watching this?  Like, how pathetic am I?  I'm actually watching, like, a guy, like, doing an impersonation of something that I  did, and I find myself watching it.  I mean, get out of the house.  Create some new stories for IMDb or something.  That is odd.  That's got to be weird.  It's like, wait a minute.  Of course, this guy, they kind of put him in there to take my place. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, and I was like, it's come to this, Sean.  You're actually watching American Pie 5 in your own apartment.  You know, like, maybe you should turn on CNN or something.  Learn something.  Get out.  Get out, man.  They got a guy to do, like, your vibe.  Not your role, but just, like, the Jackie Mason for Rodney.  Oh, the most awful thing ever on Caddyshack, too.  Dan Aykroyd doing the Bill Murray.  Yeah.  We know it well.  Some of those sequels just do not work.  Is there any mean, like, to me, like, one problem with comedies, man, is so many of  them are soft.  Billy Bob Thornton is at least kind of, does seem to have that rough sensibility. 
[02:20:30]  Is there anything, like, that's kind of, like, mean in this one that's funny?  I thought I'm pushing a wheelchair person.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like that.  He really made me happy.  Yeah, he's, you'll like it then, dude.  He's pretty crazy in this movie, guys.  Well, the movie's Mr. Woodcock.  We got to get the big plug in, didn't we?  Yeah, yeah.  It comes out Friday.  What else can you tell us about it there, Sean?  This is the big moment.  It's hilarious.  This is the big push for the movie.  I don't know.  You got people in the other room, they're like, well, he's not mentioned in the movie.  When is he going to mention the movie? 
[02:21:00]  Well, it's a crazy comedy.  I know he's having fun with these guys, but he's not mentioned in the movie.  I don't know.  There's not much detail to talk about.  It's just funny.  It's just funny.  I saw that one clip.  I mean, it's not going to change the world, but it's going to make you laugh.  Laugh at Mr. Woodcock.  Who not?  The clip I saw, I just caught part of it, was somebody pushed somebody with a wheelchair  up to the edge of the pool and just tips them in.  That had to be shown.  Was that the one that did that?  Yeah, that was him.  Wonderful.  He was yelling at him.  He was teaching the water aerobics or whatever to these old people, and he goes to the guy, 
[02:21:30]  and the guy's just sitting in his wheelchair.  He starts yelling at him, and the guy's not responding at all.  He's like, you think this is funny?  He's like, okay, I'll show you.  And he goes over, like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And he goes over, and he just tips the guy in the water, and the guy starts drowning.  It really looks funny.  That forward tip and that body just falling into the water.  You know, Sean William Scott did such a great job promoting Mr. Woodcock that I want to  bring Roland in.  Roland?  For a minute. 
[02:22:00]  Roland's our booker.  He's amazing.  He's going to put the movie over the top for you.  Roland, over here.  Can you please help give the book?  And he's got his 24 t-shirt on.  I mean, come on.  You're in good hands, Sean.  Sean William Scott from Mr. Woodcock.  Roland, have you seen Mr. Woodcock?  I've seen it, I think, this week.  What's the movie about?  Oh, thanks a lot, dude.  What's the movie about, though?  Billy Bob Thornton is a coach, and shenanigans ensue.  Shenanigans. 
[02:22:30]  And it's funny.  Who else is in the movie?  Susan Sarandon.  Sean William Scott.  And comedy.  It's funny.  Thanks a lot, bro.  We really put it over for you, man.  Really feel your enthusiasm.  What else?  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating really badly.  He gets real nervous in front of a mic. 
[02:23:00]  If you can't figure it out.  Billy Bob is funny.  He does, like,  Hey.  What is that?  I don't know.  What is it?  He's the worst.  I went with Roland to this MTV junk.  I said, I wanted to meet some celebrities and get pictures.  And he goes, I think that's Jay-Z.  It was a guy wanding people as they walked in.  I was like, this idiot.  He works for Radio City.  Jay-Z is not going to wear a suit with a, Mark, Radio City, MH. 
[02:23:30]  It's Jay-Z.  Maybe that's what he does in between, you know, CDs dropping.  It was the worst non-celebrity sighting ever.  It was two feet away from us.  Oh, Roland.  All right.  So, Mr. Woodcock, opening Friday.  Why?  This Friday.  Theater's near you.  Theater's near you.  This Friday, it comes out September the 14th.  And it looks really funny from the promo I saw.  Sean William Scott.  Thanks, man. 
[02:24:00]  You're hilarious, by the way.  Thanks.  We're all big fans, man.  Thanks a lot.  It's great to see you guys.  Go see Mr. Woodcock this Friday.  It's Sean William Scott.  Stifler.  Check it out.  And we're out.  Yeah, we're out of here.  Guys, have a great day if you're not joining us over at XM Satellite Radio.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Ah, XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:24:30]  Sean William Scott was great.  Yeah.  Ah, he was a lot of fun.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  I'm watching the reading of the names for the September 11th victims, and it's really  weird just to see the faces put with it.  And Seven, by the way, is still sticking with it.  I really hope that they don't switch, because that's a real cunty thing to do.  Oh, New York's ABC affiliate was talking about cutting a Regis.  Well, they said...  That got a Regis. 
[02:25:00]  They said they would, but then I think they got a lot of flack.  Yep.  Some of that flack, and I think they've decided they've been strong-armed into sticking with  the coverage, I believe.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  It's like, I understand that you have to move on, and we are moving on, but the reality  is this, there's still a hole in the ground where these buildings were, and you know what?  Fuck a network, and they're advertising dollars that they're going to give up a few hundred  thousand advertising.  That's all it's about.  Yeah.  It's like you can't dedicate a little bit of your time when you're whoring spick and span, 
[02:25:30]  which is fine.  That's how I make my living, too.  But can you not give a little bit of time to this fucking massacre?  Yeah.  I think it would be easier to move on.  I don't know, because I didn't lose anybody at 9-11.  But if there was something in that space now, but we're reminded because there is still  a huge hole in the ground.  And that Freedom Tower, it's horrendous. 
[02:26:00]  Nobody looks at that and feels inspired.  It's terrible.  No one wants it.  No one thinks that's a great replacement for the towers.  It's a giant antenna, which will technically make up the height.  Yeah, technically.  But it's fucking stupid.  It's nothing.  It's like you're being a chicken shit by not building it up to the height it's supposed  to be as a real building.  And even if, like, open-raised before, people wouldn't move in and stuff like that.  Okay, maybe people wouldn't rent it, but how about this?  How about the country just takes the financial hit, and you make the buildings taller, and 
[02:26:30]  make X amount of top floors.  Just build them as floors, and if people eventually want to move in, they get it.  They can, and if you lose money on, or if it's unrentable space, then you fucking take  that hit.  How about that?  We can afford it.  Maybe we don't forgive one debt to, like, I don't know, you know, whether it's Israel  or Egypt or Jordan or any other country whose debt we've forgiven.  Yeah.  How about we don't forgive one fucking foreign debt to one country?  Let's send some leg breakers over there.  How about you fill the whole top floors with water? 
[02:27:00]  That's a good idea.  And then if anything ever happens, you just release the water that's on the top floors  and let it run all the way down the building.  Yeah, then it floods everybody out.  Yeah, well, I think it's better to be flooded out than burnt out.  Yeah.  All right, so it's a weird day, I guess.  Well, if you build the floors, like, I'm not saying that they should build offices that  don't know what it'll be, but you put the concrete slabs and make, just make it, like,  so someday people will move in.  People will move in.  Make the bathrooms up there.  Yeah, exactly.  You gotta go to the 108 to take a shit. 
[02:27:30]  How about this?  The bathrooms are on floor one and floor 108.  Those are your options.  Well, you have 30 floors of bathrooms.  That would be fucking great.  Just really gigantic toilets, really lavish.  Yeah, people would love the bathrooms there.  Vacation, just to shit there.  Flock from all over the world to take a dump.  All right, hey, um, there's some 0 and 8 controversy happening today.  What happened?  There's been a controversy happening today. 
[02:28:00]  Opie what?  Big A refuses to talk.  I haven't forgotten.  Now.  I haven't forgotten the email I got over the weekend.  I'm very angry at this.  Who does he think he is?  Big A.  Big A apparently called up Bob Kelly.  Bobby was doing a show on Saturday.  Saturday Night Virus.  XM.  Saturday Night Virus.  2-0-2.  Saturday Night.  Right.  Right.  So he gets a call from an apparently, um, uh, from Big A who had been drinking. 
[02:28:30]  Let's just say that.  I was going to say apparently drunk, but I didn't hear it.  So I don't know how drunk he was, but he says he had been drinking and he goes into this  story about how he had been married.  Married, this is Big A, married for three years to a girl from, where?  Trinidad. 
[02:29:00]  Trinidad.  Who worked at a Burger King.  Trinidad.  Trinidad.  Yeah.  Do we have audio of that?  That would be good.  We could pull that up.  Do you have audio of that, Danny?  I can get it for you.  We could always steal, uh, that.  Big A has his phone off.  So I just left him a message.  And he's decided he doesn't want to talk about this.  And he goes, I don't want to talk about it.  Well, I spoke to him, uh, I spoke to him briefly yesterday and he said that it was just a personal  matter.  He, he didn't mean to call Bob Kelly.  He was drunk and the topic was brought up. 
[02:29:30]  So he was kind of feeling loose enough to talk about it.  That's not our problem.  I know.  I know.  And then he decided that it's too personal.  He doesn't want to talk about it.  But he already talked about it.  Personal.  Too personal.  He got a jack job from two whores.  Well, yeah, but the bottom line is somewhere there's a fucking ditch with a Trinidadian foot sticking  out of it.  That's why it's too personal.  Fucking, he, he, he didn't mean to kill her.  He was like fucking, uh, Georgian of mice and men.  He was just petting her in a barn.  She died.  I got to see.  I hope she didn't die.  Sorry if she did, big guy. 
[02:30:00]  I have no idea.  I would see.  He should talk about it.  Let's get the audio from Saturday Night Virus and then we'll go from there.  Yeah.  And, uh, big A, you got a call and give us some details.  Big A.  And then you got happy typing girl all over freaking CNN headline news this weekend.  Yeah, I watched that clip.  Or yesterday, right?  Be funny, she was denouncing the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Just drummed off the air.  Drummed off.  Uh, well, she was, uh, she was, um, talking about the Clearasil commercials.  Before we get way into that, uh, Sean William Scott's Wikipedia has been updated on September 
[02:30:30]  11th, 2007 on the Opie and Anthony show.  Scott claims he does indeed, uh, he does indeed wear underwear and is not into body modification.  Wikipedia sucks, he would later claim.  He would later claim.  He would later claim.  All right.  Before we move on, I've been laughing the whole time because when they came in, they hung these  little, uh, like, you know how in a room, when you're in a hotel, you have a Do Not  Disturb sign?  Yeah.  Uh, he's nuts. 
[02:31:00]  They hung this, uh, all over the place.  We're seeing these things.  They're like.  Oh, they're on every doorknob in the studio.  I challenge you to walk into a room and not have a laugh at this.  It's, uh, the promotion for Mr. Woodcock.  And it says, uh, let me see if this room's rocking, don't come knocking.  That probably means like, you know, if there's some, you know, you know what going on in there,  don't bother us.  Ah, look at that.  Every door.  You're hanging it on your mic. 
[02:31:30]  Please, if I, if any, it's a very depressing day in our country, I want to have a laugh.  Well, yeah.  Look.  Laugh riot.  Anyone get the feeling that, uh, Sean William Scott thinks that, uh, Mr. Woodcock sucks?  Well, I think he just thinks it's another in his, uh, a long line of movie credits.  Perhaps not one of the more memorable ones that will be over the years.  But, you know, it's, uh, what they call a paycheck.  Kind of got that feeling when he's like, well, what else can I say about it?  It's a movie.  It's a movie.  Make you laugh a little. 
[02:32:00]  How you gonna laugh?  It's not gonna change the world.  He didn't really sell it too much.  Very funny guy.  We liked him on the show.  Just a little suspicious.  You know what?  It's gonna make, uh, a lot of money in, um, uh, uh, DVDs.  And Barcelona.  And, uh, yeah, Barcelona.  Barcelona.  Uh, Matt from New York City.  Cable.  New whack bag name.  Trinidadian.  Trinidad.  Oh, boy.  I can't even say it.  Trinidad.  How do you say it, Jimmy?  Trinidadian.  Oh, Trinidadian. 
[02:32:30]  Trinidadian.  Trinidadian.  Trinidadian.  Trinidadian foot is a new, uh, name on whack bag.  All right.  So, yeah.  We had happy typing girl.  Trinidadian foot.  Uh, peopleagainstcensorship.com, I think.  I think that website's up and runny again.  I wanted to plug for Debbie once.  And she said the website was having some kind of an issue.  I'm assuming it's back up.  But they do some great stuff.  They helped us a lot.  Um, when we were having some trouble, they fought back.  And it really helps, man.  Certainly did.  To have people pushing back a little bit.  I'm out of, I'm out of touch on this one. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, this is over Clearasil commercial.  The Clearasil ad.  I haven't seen it, I don't think.  I don't, I'll hear it.  Take a little look-see.  I don't think I've seen this yet.  And what's the problem with the Clearasil ad?  Oh, it's, it's promoting teen, teen sex.  We're gonna hear it.  Yeah?  Oh, do I have it here?  I do have it here.  Okay.  I'd love to hear this.  All right, I'll go hear it there, E-Rock.  This is, um.  Hi, I'm E-Rock.  A mother, um, a boyfriend in the middle.  And the daughter. 
[02:33:30]  Mother and daughter.  Right.  Boyfriend in the middle.  Right.  And, uh, they're all chatting.  All right.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I'm gonna get my stuff.  So, Miss Kelly, everything good?  Yeah, thanks.  No, it's not.  Now it's a new one.  Now that Mr. K left.  Jesus.  I'm really good company.  All right.  Let's go.  Love you, Mom.  Clearasil daily face wash.  May cause confidence.  That wasn't even it. 
[02:34:00]  I got another one.  That's all cut up to pieces.  What the hell was that crap you just played, E-Rock?  No, I played it over here.  That was, uh, E-Rock was, E-Rock was being encouraged.  He was, he had the right one.  He was showing us the video.  Uh, Greg, here's the actor who plays Opie, put that one in.  But he was probably given the wrong one because he doesn't make mistakes.  Yeah, that, that doesn't even.  So there's.  Makes sense.  That's not the one that they have a problem with?  No, that is a problem they have a problem with.  That is one of a young, a boy.  Wait, what's, what's different about the commercial?  Do they chop it?  They're two different commercials.  So they don't have a problem with the one we just played? 
[02:34:30]  Right.  No, they do.  They have a problem with all of them.  Oh.  There's two different ones.  So what's the problem with that one?  This one is a young boy walking up to his friend's mother.  Right.  And trying to pick her up.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Because he's got this confidence.  The whole thing is, uh, Clarice Hill gives you confidence to do things that you wouldn't  normally do.  So he's very confident.  So he feels he's going to pick up this friend's mother.  So he's like, Hey, how you doing?  You know, he's very confident.  And in the other one, it's the mother, the boyfriend and the daughter sitting on a couch  and the mother is showing pictures to the boyfriend. 
[02:35:00]  And she goes, here, uh, is, uh, what's her name?  The daughter in the bathtub.  Uh, look how, uh, cute she is.  And then the girlfriend looks over real sexy and goes, you should see me now.  Ah, ah.  So they say that people, uh, some groups are saying that it's promoting teen sex instead  of what it's doing, which is showing that how confident Clarice Hill will make you.  Wait, what, what groups?  I'm going to guess it's the parents television.  Of course it is.  So what kind of cunty parents belong to that organization? 
[02:35:30]  Uh, the ones that they put on the interview show that, um, Debbie was on.  Yeah.  Oh, she was on with some of these people?  Oh yeah.  Maybe she could call the show.  Or is she too busy hanging out with, you know, oh, there she is.  She's very, Debbie's always on top of me.  I was ready to trash her.  Oh my God.  She's fantastic.  She looks like Ann Coulter, but with darker hair.  Is she on there?  Let me see.  Trinidadian.  I can't say the name.  Trinidadian.  Trinidadian.  Trinidadian Foot writes, uh, wow, that was quick. 
[02:36:00]  Please find me and give my family some closure.  I was petting her.  Oh, Deb's got her big eye makeup on.  All right.  I wouldn't know because.  Hey, here's the commercial Anthony just explained.  Here's when we brought her home from the hospital.  Here's her first tooth.  Isn't she cute?  Yeah.  Oh, and here she is naked in the bath. 
[02:36:30]  You should see me now.  No.  Oh yeah.  Clear sill daily face wash may cause confidence.  All right.  I might have a problem with that.  I just think it stinks.  It's a bad acting and it's like a porno.  Sexy.  You know what would have been great?  I don't even know what they're selling by the end of that.  If she grabbed her mother's hair and pushed her face in her own groin like fucking Reagan  in the exorcist.  That was just a dumb commercial. 
[02:37:00]  It was like with the mother you're saying.  Who are you being sexy for your mother?  It was just corny.  She was looking over at the boyfriend when she said that.  Like, cause the boyfriend's looking at the pictures and she's like, you should see me  now.  Yeah.  So clear sill gets you laid.  Uh, clear sill.  No, it gives you confidence.  No.  Go out and pick up milfs.  It gets you laid.  Yeah.  Okay.  You'll be, uh, poking, uh, stink knuckles all over time.  So what was, uh, what was, uh, Debbie just came on to do? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  We got Debbie on the line here.  Debbie.  Hey, guys.  Hi, sweetheart.  How are you?  Hi, Deb.  I'm doing good.  You gotta see all three commercials to kind of get what they were doing.  It was a series of three things.  It's supposed to be over the top and funny and, you know, it's, you'll be so confident  that you'll let people see you naked kind of thing.  Okay.  And no kid would ever, like, go in and talk to a friend's mother like that.  That is so over the top, like, trying to pick her up. 
[02:38:00]  It's so obvious that no one would do that.  So the whole gist of it is that you'll be so confident that you could actually do that.  And, uh, saying that it's promoting sex.  The third commercial that CNN didn't bother to show really shows it because it's a college  boy going up to a male professor saying, you know, if you're nervous, you can picture  me naked.  I mean, come on.  A lot of sex going on in those commercials.  So what, what the, uh, the, uh, the parents, uh, the parents television council, again, just 
[02:38:30]  these, these fucking nerds, were they, uh, had a problem with it?  Yeah, they had a problem with it.  And there's a couple of, you know, uh, message boards of conservative moms that are talking  about it.  But, you know, even in those boards, they're fighting with each other saying, what's the  big deal?  If you teach your children, you know, they're not going to be that influenced by a clear  still commercial.  So you were on, uh, on CNN or something.  What, what, what, what got you on?  Were you supposed to be debating somebody? 
[02:39:00]  I was debating a woman from, who's a representative of the, uh, PTC, but really it was the, the  anchor from CNN headline news who embarrassed himself.  He was like, he, he, he was completely against, uh, what you had to say.  He was, I think these are awful.  These shouldn't be on the air.  And so he was real subjective.  Might have a clip of that.  I don't believe for a minute that he believed what he was saying.  He was saying this commercial shouldn't force me to have to talk to my 15 year old child. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, that was good.  And talk to her at a sex pot.  Yeah.  Speaking of sex pots, I'm looking at a video of Debbie.  How fucking hot are you on film?  Holy crap, man.  I usually see a drunk at FH Riley's, man.  Oh, wow.  Wee, look at you.  You look really good.  You got the nice little rouge on and your hair is all straight.  You got the makeup.  You got the, like, the hair is all fluffy up nice.  Thank you.  Damn, Deb.  Look at you.  I can't go drunk into CNN.  You should have done a bit.  Oh, give that a try. 
[02:40:00]  You motherfuckers.  Go fuck yourself, CNN.  And another thing.  Yeah.  Your hair pulls out and likes a lot of cock.  What do you think of that?  Wow.  Go to YouTube and punch in Debbie Wolf.  People are getting a cap that said horny on CNN.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Oh, really?  Let's get into this then.  So we got the anchors introducing the topic of offensive clear-acill ads.  New provocative ads for the acne cream clear-acill have parents really upset, including Mike Alanos. 
[02:40:30]  I'm a parent.  I'm a little upset myself here, too.  This is tonight's Get to the Point segment.  And boy, whoo.  Let's face it.  We work with some pretty open-minded people.  Some of the words they used.  Appalling.  Disgusting.  Give you the creeps.  We're talking about clear-acill here to help with teens with acne for years now.  Well, they've got this may cause confidence campaign.  I just don't get this.  In this day and age, when you've got teachers, we've done the stories.  Jumping in the sack with their students.  Mary Kay Letourneau.  We're bringing this.  Ah, they're just telling it like it is. 
[02:41:00]  You know, you want to poke her in the sewer pipe.  You don't want a big pimple nearby.  I don't think that was the gist of the commercial, but okay.  Anyone else notice I'm doing my Jimmy Schubert impression today?  Oh, yeah.  One of the old stink knuckle.  Hey, you've got to keep poking her in the air until you've got some potato flakes all over your corn dog.  What?  Jimmy, I didn't understand you.  Take your rhino horn.  Put it right up there next to your elephant eye. 
[02:41:30]  And you're going to wind up with a little bit of snow dangruff all over your pinky mule.  There you go.  Jimmy, I don't understand.  He has more ways to describe fucking.  I don't know what he means.  I've poked her in the stink knuckle.  The stink knuckle.  Yeah, you poke her in the stink knuckle, and then you go around to the man with the hat,  and he just starts describing things that aren't even dirty.  And then you get the sunglasses, the guy, with a watch wrapped around your dinky doodle.  You're dinky doodle.  Huh?  Jimmy, I don't know what that means. 
[02:42:00]  So I was talking to the guy.  Sit back, relax, Uncle Ted.  We'll take college.  Yeah, kind of.  So I was talking to the guy that was driving the canoe.  What?  Yeah, the man on the boat.  And I got the canoe.  And all of a sudden, I'm down.  And all of a sudden, you got rice krispie treats all over your backflorger.  I don't know what a backflorger is, but he says it.  Rice krispie treats.  Yeah.  You get a hair full of rice krispie treats.  What?  Fast Freddy writes, appalling, disgusting, creepy.  And then he writes, was Big A on CNN, too? 
[02:42:30]  That anchor assumed the chick was 16 in the commercial.  Yeah, yeah.  And the kid was all worked up.  That's when Deb called him horny.  Yeah.  All right.  So they had problems with that, huh?  Yeah.  I can't believe that shit.  I guess they had nothing else to talk about.  So, Debbie, did they contact you?  Or did you like, I think it's pretty cool.  She's like a go-to, like, pushback person.  Now, how did you get contacted for this?  Yeah, that's exactly it. 
[02:43:00]  They have me in their list now, so when they need someone to talk about it.  They totally ambushed me.  The pre-interview, the guy completely made it sound like he's on my side.  They only gave me one of the clips that they were going to talk about and then focused on the other one.  So they weren't looking to make this easy.  Right.  Right.  Wow, motherfuckers.  I said, thank you for letting us have something to say here, because usually you guys don't call this side of the conversation.  Well, why don't we see what HTG had to say for herself on TV? 
[02:43:30]  Ooh, let's.  All right.  Joining me now from Washington to talk about this, Melissa Henson.  She's with the Parents Television Council.  She wants the ads off the air.  We're going to get to her in a minute.  Also from New York, Debbie Wolf, the co-founder of People Against Censorship.  All right, Debbie.  Like I said, I told you, we just mentioned some of the reactions.  Mine is, it's disgusting.  How are you supporting this ad?  It's not so much the ad that I'm supporting as the right to air it and being against people looking to pull things off the air.  Our country is full of people with very different moral compasses. 
[02:44:00]  And for one group or even two groups to say, you should listen to my moral compass instead of everybody others, concerns me.  I thought the ads were funny.  I thought they were over the top.  And if you look at all three of them, I really don't see how you can't get the humor.  I'm going to pause this for a second because she's right.  You have to listen to some, but not anybody others.  I think anybody others.  You bastard.  You had to call her out on that one.  I like the way that Debbie just takes a bunch of expressions and puts them together.  Debbie says whatever the fuck she wants to say. 
[02:44:30]  I'm just amazed.  She's like the new Ann Coulter.  How did this happen?  She is a representative of free speech on the news these days.  This is awesome.  Out of nowhere, she just decided, I'm going to be this.  And they just, and they assume you're an expert.  I love this.  Which you are.  She is.  No, you're a legal expert.  No, she's smart.  Debbie is very smart.  But it's amazing that you could go from just, I don't know, just an everyday life to the person they call whenever there's a controversy on CNN. 
[02:45:00]  Well, dude, you could listen to Debbie's point of view or you could listen to everybody others.  It just doesn't matter.  Oh, oh.  Oh, I may.  Wait a minute when you talk about the advertires, Jim.  Oh, no.  Do you say advertires?  Oh, I love her.  Advertires.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  You really are.  She's a really beautiful rich voice.  Listen, Pupul against censorship refuses to Bukul.  All right, let's listen to this. 
[02:45:30]  I'm surprised you didn't call it a moral cunt piss.  All right, go ahead.  All right, who are the players here?  Let's stay with you, Debbie, on this one real quick.  Mom's a powerless buffoon.  You got horny, awkward teen in the middle.  And the girl's the sex bot.  Do we really need to sex up our teens any more than they already are?  Ew.  I don't know.  I don't know where we got 16-year-olds, first of all.  I don't think they're going to agree.  She doesn't look much older than that, but go ahead.  Make your point.  I'm not sure how we know that the boy is horny, either.  But you asked where the parents come in on this, or how does my daughter respond to this? 
[02:46:00]  How do my children respond to it?  The response is because you as a parent are there, and you're watching this commercial,  and you have an opportunity to explain to your children how they should react.  Well, Chester's Liver says it all from Whackbag, of course.  Four months ago, H.D.G. was folding her towels on Pound Talk.  Now she's debating people on CNN.  That's what I was getting at.  That's what I was getting at right there.  She's looking very lovely, too.  Yeah, I mean, wow.  Well, look at her hair on Pound Talk. 
[02:46:30]  It's all brushed over and sexy.  Very sassy looking.  And who told you not to wear all those things in your hair?  You did, O.  Look at the sex coming out now.  What was she wearing in her hair?  I'm a big fan when she doesn't have the things in her hair.  The headbands.  What'd you have?  The headbands and stuff.  She's got really nice, very nice hair.  Yeah.  I want a bouffon.  Could you do a bouffon?  Perhaps a beehive to remind me of Helen.  A pompadour. 
[02:47:00]  Can you go on?  I want you to be Cesare from The Idolmaker.  I want you to go on CNN Headline News next time as Amy Winehouse.  Like, wow, she's been really good in the past, but what's wrong with her?  I want to somehow see if we can get Debbie to say Wolf Blitzer is a cunt.  Is there any way to get her to say that?  But to make it conversational.  Debbie, you do understand you've got to blow up your spot eventually.  Oh, I assume I'm going to have to.  Yeah, when it starts getting a little old, you're going to have to just lose your mind on live CNN. 
[02:47:30]  That would be hilarious.  Go out in style.  Debbie, is the site up and stuff?  Yeah, the site's up.  It hasn't been updated, and actually, as long as I've got a chance now,  we're looking for people to kind of bring back into the forefront and get really involved again.  We kind of dropped the ball on it.  I've got to admit, you know, I'm new to all this.  A lot of people give me a hard time on some of the boards.  I took it kind of hard, but I decided to grow up and get over that. 
[02:48:00]  Wait, giving you a hard time about what?  Why were they giving you a hard time?  About what?  You know, saying it's all about her ego.  She doesn't care about anything.  This is all just an ego trip, you know?  Really?  Yeah, really.  Debbie, listen to me.  She only single-handedly saved the Opie and Anthony show.  I shouldn't say it, because then other people would be like,  Oh, we did our part, too.  You're out there fighting for something.  Yeah, but you did a lot to make sure we stayed on the radio.  You're fighting for something, debating things,  and these fucking cunts... 
[02:48:30]  Do nothing.  ...who have 5,000 posts and yet still complain about Paltor people having no life  are fucking, are tearing you down because you're trying to stop people  from yanking shit off the air.  Fuck them.  I've kind of figured that out now.  So if, you know, people want to get involved, you know,  please contact me on either one of the boards  or email happytypinggirl at AOL.com.  We're going to put together a team and really get this thing back going.  And, you know, I bet most of the people who are shitting on you 
[02:49:00]  for trying to stop people from yanking things  are the same people that fucking always write stuff under other names  because they're terrified of being associated by their real name  with what they wrote.  So, you know, it's fucking, it's just despicable.  Just keep doing what you're doing,  even if it's not for the Opie and Anthony show or any radio show.  It's still, it's really great.  Yeah, it really is.  Here's more HTG.  If you look on the message boards that are attacking this ad,  there are also people saying my daughter, my son, 
[02:49:30]  looked at that and thought that was awful.  That's because they educated their children  to the moral code that they are seeking.  And that's how you deal with ads like this.  Well, again, I shouldn't be forced by Clearasil or anybody else  to have this conversation when my son or daughter isn't ready.  Excuse me.  Oh my God.  Did you point out that he works for...  I almost lost my mind there.  Yeah.  Did you point out that he works for CNN and say,  well, then do you take into consideration what you show on a daily basis?  Yeah.  What about the conversations you have to have then? 
[02:50:00]  And what kid is watching that?  There's so much I wanted to say and they never went back to us.  They just ended it there.  Of course not.  The fucking anchor got his opinion out with his faggoty green tie.  It's awful.  It's like, why would you have to have a conversation with your child after...  Everything that's on TV now,  I had to have a conversation with my young child.  My father used to tell me,  dude, just shut up.  I don't know.  Figure it out later.  Or why is it so...  I'm sorry.  If his kid can't handle that, 
[02:50:30]  then it's a good thing they're forcing him to have that conversation  because he needs to have it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But can I say that?  Why is it so bad to have a conversation with your child?  It's almost like it forces me...  How about this?  That's the way the real world is,  shithead.  The kid sees something,  he's not sure of it,  so he talks to you,  the fuckhead green tie phony anchor cunt from CNN.  Like, I don't understand why that's...  It forced me to have... 
[02:51:00]  When do you think you're going to have a conversation with your child?  We're in a room,  it's full of balloons and roses,  and I decide to talk about sodomy.  No.  He sees something about sodomy,  and he says,  hey, what's sodomy?  And you show him.  Fucking unbelievable.  Good point, Jim.  But it's amazing how they actually get such a fucking chore  to have a conversation with their kids.  Fuck you and fuck your kids.  Don't have them if you don't have conversations.  Right.  I love kids,  but there's a big world out there. 
[02:51:30]  We all want to live together,  and, you know,  why does everything have to be influenced  by what the children are going to think?  Well, just explain it to them.  Ah, it's nothing.  They're just trying to sell...  How about you point out how silly the commercial is.  Ah, they're just being silly.  Holy shit.  Hold on.  This cunt Jessica from fucking Cunt Clifton.  Language.  HTG single-handedly saved your show.  I fucking stopped myself and said a lot of people did.  I guess none of your fans that canceled XM 
[02:52:00]  or rallied for your support  had anything to do with it.  Yes, it was all one fucking fan that did the work.  Fuck that.  Is that what I said, Jessica?  Yeah.  You cunt.  Actually, it was.  You cunt.  This was all a big scam.  The suspension was just a vacation,  and, yeah, no one helped us.  I hate these people that just selectively hear shit.  I actually stopped myself,  slowed down the conversation,  and explained myself further.  I think Ope was talking about, 
[02:52:30]  and I'll explain it for my friend,  that as an organization,  she was the face of the organization.  At the forefront of that push.  We thanked the fans tremendously.  Of course the fans helped.  Right.  There was someone that was able to get on TV  and push back.  Yes.  We weren't allowed to.  The company certainly wasn't going to do it.  Now, behind the scenes,  there were a bunch of fans canceling subs  and doing things like that,  backing us up.  We understand that.  Of course.  Shut up, Jessica.  You cunt.  Yes, Stephen S. from Bayshore, you're right. 
[02:53:00]  Cunt Clifton was a lesser-known Muppet.  Oh, Jimmy, is that you?  No.  Sound like a trumpet.  Oh, no.  What does it mean?  Muff.  I don't make that.  Muff.  Here's the statement from Clearasil.  We wanted to get a representative from Clearasil.  Here's their statement.  I want to let everybody know.  It says,  Our objective is to inform and entertain,  not to offend.  We have found that Clearasil consumers  see this ad as we intended,  a humorous and unrealistic presentation  of an awkward family event.  I don't know of many awkward family events like that, 
[02:53:30]  but I think we're going to have to leave it there.  We've run out of time.  But that's the point.  I don't know of many awkward family events like that.  That's the point.  It's an event that you wouldn't normally see, dummy.  Well, but what they're saying is they take a family event  and make it like,  he doesn't understand the awkwardness of just a mother  and a boyfriend with the daughter.  Like, is that that uncommon?  Just being in that situation is awkward.  Yeah, like,  that's a very normal thing  that's being parodied and made silly. 
[02:54:00]  Unless she cocks in her mouth,  then it's not awkward at all.  Right.  That's perfect.  Yeah.  Bobbing up and down.  Come all over her photo album.  Yeah, this anchor really was kind of a,  what a stick in the mud.  Oh, it's Tim Witt.  I have to.  What's his name?  I don't even know.  Do you know, Debbie?  Michael something forgettable.  Oh, Mike Galanos?  I never heard of this guy.  Galanos?  G-A-L-A-N-O-S.  He's trying to work a,  work a name for himself 
[02:54:30]  and it ain't working.  What a nerd.  What a goody two-shoes.  Yeah.  Well, Debbie,  another fine job on TV.  Network TV.  Cable Network TV.  Look at that.  Please just blow it up one day, though.  Yeah.  Let's get a few more good ones on.  Here's Debbie Wolf  to talk about freedom of speech.  Hi, assholes.  Let me, uh.  Here's some freedom of fucking speech.  Right in your fuck hole.  I mean, it's just,  it's just so great 
[02:55:00]  to be able to have somebody,  you know, like,  speak to these people  that we all curse all day long,  like the PTC and Sharpton and everything.  Yeah.  So, it feels so good  to have a chance to answer them.  That in combination  with you being a detention whore,  it's great.  Anyway, I have two ways  that I want Debbie  to possibly blow it up.  To possibly blow it up.  Let's hear that.  When it's time, not yet.  I want you to,  as you're talking,  somehow blame it on the Jews.  Like, I keep it very casually going,  look, the problem with censorship 
[02:55:30]  as the Jews know.  And that just makes you so...  And then the guy would be like,  it's a Jew.  Or...  Did you say the Jews?  Yes, of course I did.  How about this?  When they go to you  and they go,  and we have a comment  from People Against Censorship,  Debbie Wolf,  just look at them and go,  hold on, I'm shitting.  And then...  Don't say anything.  Just say,  hold on, I'm shitting.  See how long I stay on you.  Shut your eyes.  Have a satisfied look on your face. 
[02:56:00]  The newspaper held up.  All right.  We'll let Debbie come in there.  Thank you.  Back to folding towels.  I know.  Bye, Debbie.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Happy, happy girl, everyone.  Damn, she's a good smile.  Sexy.  Absolutely, she did great.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Vegas.  Jeff, what's up?  I was just saying,  they got this Clear Star commercial.  Have you ever seen an Axe commercial?  They got the one  where the mom's hitting on  the daughter's boyfriend.  I mean, they're way worse. 
[02:56:30]  I've never heard a peep about that.  Thank you.  Well, you'll hear a peep now, sir.  Peep.  You just opened up the floodgates.  Why don't we just take a break?  When we get back,  we got exactly what Big A said  on Bob Kelly's radio.  Ah, good.  We've stolen the audio.  Yeah, we got some interesting clips,  but he doesn't want to talk all of a sudden.  What's that about?  Well, maybe it's a personal issue.  And I think that we have to respect that. 
[02:57:00]  No, we don't.  No, we should.  I mean, look, the bottom line is,  if Andrew doesn't want to discuss something,  I still like talking to Big A.  I don't want to lose him  as a friend of this show.  I'm happy.  I do.  I like the guy.  I'm happy to talk to him  about other crap.  He's still funny.  I mean,  if he doesn't want to talk about it,  Oh, Jimmy.  Maybe he'll post about it  on a message board.  That's all right.  We'll hear it all here  from Bob Kelly's  little Friday extravaganza,  so screw it.  On the next Opie and Anthony show,  Opie and Anthony face their toughest challenge yet. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  Listen as one man describes an addiction.  Wherever there were cocks, there was me.  And how he went from one cock to many.  I was taking a hundred a night.  What do you think of them apples?  Then you'll hear a horrifying tale  of a bukkake party gone wrong.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  All over my fat, colorless stomach.  You can't tell where the cum ends  and my skin begins.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  Plus, an ending you won't want to miss.  That's right.  I see a couple of men do some docking 
[02:58:00]  and settle this.  It all happens on the next  Opie and Anthony show.  Uncle Sully, the rumor's true. 
[02:58:30]  Right?  That people think.  Oh, that one?  Yeah.  It just got cold in here.  Hmm?  Just got cold in here.  No, Tim.  I just felt it.  Hell of a breeze coming through.  So, what happened with Big A?  We got the audio here.  Big A was apparently married.  Who knew? 
[02:59:00]  To some girl from Trinidad.  And she worked at Burger King.  And I don't know how the marriage ended.  And we got clips from Bob Kelly's show?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the first one.  Bob Kelly looking for advice about getting married.  Gets a call from Big A.  Who drops the bombshell that he was married.  Wow.  Let's hear this.  Big A, how you doing?  Big A's on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, Bob.  How are you?  Hey, Bob.  How you doing?  Good.  Where are you? 
[02:59:30]  At mud wrestling?  Um, so actually, I'm at F.A.  Riley's.  4th of New York Avenue.  And I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just,  All right, buddy.  Hey, hey, Big A, would you ever get married?  Um, actually, I was married once, I'll never get married again.  You were married, dude?  Yeah.  How long were you married for, dude?  Um, um, three years.  You were three years?  Are you kidding me? 
[03:00:00]  What, uh, how old were you when you got married?  Um, um, I was 30.  Oh, no, uh, hold on.  So I didn't do that.  What?  Big, Big A.  Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.  Okay, dude, let me ask you, did you divorce her or did she divorce you?  Um, naturally, she divorced me. 
[03:00:30]  Why did she divorce you?  Well, I, I mean, all right, well, okay.  I'll just ask it.  I get it, but go ahead.  We started getting along.  It was always about how much money I made, and it was always about his money.  All right, get Big A on the phone.  He didn't sound that drunk.  There's a story to be told.  I love how he tries to do the, uh, FH Riley's plug the right way.  Yeah.  In the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[03:01:00]  In Huntington.  Uh, uh, uh, Long Island.  But, uh, he won't come on the show?  He'll come on.  We'll just, just...  He's still got to get back to me.  He still has to get back to me.  He, uh, his phone went straight to voicemail when I called him.  Well, do we have a home number for him, or do we only have a cell?  I think I only have a cell phone number.  Maybe Steve has it, no?  You know, it's too late, Big A.  You got to call us now and give us all the details.  How'd you meet her, all this stuff.  Yeah.  Well, he kind of gets into it a little bit in the next clip.  All right, let's take a listen. 
[03:01:30]  Well, where is she now?  Uh, I don't know.  You don't know?  What, what, what nationality was she?  Um, she, she, from Trinidad.  She was from Trinidad?  You, she was black?  Well, yeah, I'm dark, yeah.  Dark.  Yeah, I'm dark, but I'm black, but I'm black, but yeah.  You were married to a black chick, dude, from Trinidad?  What, did you find her floating on a raft?  Where'd you meet?  No. 
[03:02:00]  Um, um.  All right, we're going to take a break in three, three minutes.  You got to speed this up, big guy.  Where'd you meet?  Um, up in Yankee.  Just working at the Burger King and met up at Yankees.  You met her at a Burger King?  Yeah.  Was she working there?  Yeah, she was.  She was, and you used to go there every day?  Yep.  And she used to make you a Whopper, and then you went on a, what was your first date? 
[03:02:30]  At Burger King?  No, no, no.  She's supposed to be at a diner.  That's great, man.  So, so then she dumped you after three years.  Do you miss her?  Yep.  Not at all.  No?  Did you ever hit her?  No, I never hit her.  All right, now, did the sex die off after a little while?  Ten minutes. 
[03:03:00]  Um, not really.  So you had sex all the way up until the end?  Yeah.  Did you have to hold her down?  No, not at all.  All right, well, Jesus Christ, big A, I didn't know you were married.  God bless you, man.  Um, well, you know, I'm getting married.  Do you think I should get married or not?  Um, actually, no.  All right.  All right.  It's not a, uh, it's not a favor of marriage, but I hope it works out for you.  All right, buddy.  All right, well, thank you for calling in, dude. 
[03:03:30]  Uh, tell everybody out there we said hi, and, uh, I will see you.  All right, I will.  All right, bye, buddy.  Have a good night.  All right, bye.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Big A was married.  Wow.  So that's just the beginning of the, uh, the old iceberg.  Oh, no.  Trinidad.  She must have married him because, uh, she, she assumed he had a lot of money.  How would she assume that?  Well, with all the money he was spending in Burger King.  That, like, lets somebody know. 
[03:04:00]  See, it's a fat joke.  That lets somebody.  See, if you're going to Burger King.  Yeah.  The amount of money he would be spending in there to, you know, keep his body going.  A girl from Trinidad.  I'd love to see a picture.  God, would I love to see a picture.  Oh, my God.  You can't, and, and then, uh, Danny does the right thing.  He calls Big A, like, what the fuck?  You gotta get up, get on, uh, Opie and Anthony and explain yourself here.  And he's like, ah, I don't want to talk about it.  Well, the weird thing was, is, like, when I first approached him about it, you know, he knew  what I was calling about, and he didn't seem, like, too bugged about it. 
[03:04:30]  And then I get an email this morning when I woke up, you know, that he sent out at 3 a.m.  saying that he decided that it was a personal matter, and he doesn't want to get into it  at all.  What, what did his agent, no filter Paul, uh, get involved?  Well, uh.  Publicist.  I do.  Publicist and slash agent.  I think he was getting annoyed.  Hold out, Big A.  I think we could get something out of this one.  Well, when I spoke to him, he sounded kind of annoyed, because he did mention that Paul  was trying to find the ex-wife.  Oh.  Ah, okay.  Well, no filter Paul.  Paul's a buddinski. 
[03:05:00]  Where's he today?  Where's he today?  Because he, he knows a little bit about this.  Can we get him on the phone?  Let's get him on the phone.  Let's talk to Paul.  Oh, we gotta work this story.  Paul is a fucking, a master at finding shit.  Yeah.  Except for a head that's proper size for his body.  He's been unable to locate a head that belongs on anyone who's taller than one foot.  He's the wrong guy to be fat.  He's, it's not even, it's, it's that he's got, even if he had like washboard abs, you'd  still go, who's the little-headed man?  He's got a tiny little head. 
[03:05:30]  Who's the Lego-haired little-headed fella?  Get over here.  And you, and you'd take a hat, and you'd take a bobby pin and close the back of it even  more and put it on his little head.  And he has a teensy, teensy little head.  You know, he's got some wacky DNA in there somewhere.  Oh, it's awful.  Yeah, there's something going on.  It's like somebody in his family fucked a hummingbird.  And like, he got like everything except the head size came from the hummingbird and the  brain.  He's an odd little man. 
[03:06:00]  With his awful English accent.  Oh, firty free.  Firty free.  Well.  It's firty free.  All right, we'll wait for no filter Paul to call in.  He's kind of like a rat in the sense that his head can get through a space the size  of a quarter, but then his shoulders get stuck.  So he's not good at crawling through things, but he's a great peeker.  Yeah.  Paul's a wonderful peeker.  If you're like, what's going on in there?  He'll put his little head through the crack.  Under a door.  He can do that.  He can flatten his little head out.  Put it under a door, but his shoulders, it's over. 
[03:06:30]  Well, God bless E-Rock.  He's looking up Trinidad women right now.  Ah, so we're going to get to see what one looks like.  You get some light ones, you get some dark ones, and everything in between.  Yeah, I think...  And they all have, like, tassel outfits.  Don't they have that accent?  Trinidad.  Yeah, isn't it like that?  Kind of Jamaican, sort of.  Yeah, almost like Jamaican, man.  That's a little something else in there.  Hey, Big A, you're not bringing home the money.  The bacon.  Bring home the bacon. 
[03:07:00]  Wow, that's a girl from Trinidad, huh?  Very nice.  Yuck.  That's very nice.  Yeah, the brackets.  She has gigantic...  Two different opinions on this broad.  Gigantic big Trinidadian...  And a Britney Spears belly.  Yeah, and it's up to you.  What?  Slob.  There you go.  Look at that fucking...  In the Middle East, there's a woman sitting with a tent on her head.  What the fuck is wrong with people that they live like that?  There's a woman, she's like, cousin it.  Well, I would like to know what she's saying, but it's also telling you what the NASDAQ is doing 
[03:07:30]  right over the translation of what she's saying.  The way they fucking treat women in that shithole.  Oh, she's got to do this now, too.  Even if you visit, you got to put the cousin it...  The cousin it costume.  That's a lovely way to treat your women, because you can't keep your dick in your pants.  Look at what they got to wear.  You can't even see.  They put a grid in front of their eyeballs the same color as the...  Wow.  It's amazing how such strong men are so easily overpowered by pussy.  Yeah, they can't take a pussy. 
[03:08:00]  How about a fucking ankle?  That's a real conviction.  An ankle, and they're losing their mind.  Why wouldn't you want to look at women?  Like, I don't get that.  Look how they have to wrap themselves up.  You're in a society where you don't want to look at women.  That is so bizarre.  And then you could just beat the piss out of one of them right there, and no one could do shit about it.  But they'd rather look at other men.  Yeah.  Well, and hold hands with other men.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  A couple of men will hold hands. 
[03:08:30]  What do you...  For drugs like those boys there are smoking.  What is this?  I guess...  What are they, panhandling?  Angry and invisible under the burqa.  For the West, this veil has been a symbol of women's oppression here.  Yeah.  But, you know, let's face it.  The issue of the burqa...  Burqa.  ...is just the tip of the iceberg.  Afghan women face...  By the way, let it be noted, we're looking at a really hot woman right now.  Without her burqa on. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, she has to be a reporter?  ...where I found her.  A lone blue figure crouching in the mud.  Her future, and the future of thousands like her, uncertain.  It looks warm.  But it's just an embarrassment, like...  ...to know who's joining us now, live from London.  Thanks for being with us.  I want to ask you a few more questions about some of the material that we just saw.  Blurqa, blurqa, blurqa.  It's a lovely culture.  A lovely...  Yeah.  A lovely group of people.  All right.  That's the way you should treat your women. 
[03:09:30]  That should be respected and celebrated.  They look like ghosts.  That's what they're supposed to be.  They're just running around, you see nothing of them, because apparently the men in that  culture can't handle it.  So the power of the pussy is bigger than you.  Yeah.  That's a real man.  Can't handle yourself.  Oh, yeah.  It's good.  Lovely.  9-11 tribute songs.  We did a few of these yesterday because we were on a little holiday.  That was when it first happened, like maybe a month after, I guess, maybe even a little 
[03:10:00]  less.  The song started spilling.  The song started coming in.  These opportunists started thinking, hey, if I write a song and it gets popular, that's  going to be great, and I'll be the 9-11 song guy.  So they wrote these hokey, awful, maudlin, morbid songs, and they all stunk.  Well, we found some new ones.  And it was the first last.  It was really hard to be funny back then because it was like, there were people who had victims 
[03:10:30]  in their family and shit calling in.  Yeah.  Especially here in New York.  It was really sad.  And there was nothing funny to be said.  And then all of a sudden, we found an angle that we felt comfortable fucking around with,  which was this.  Which was these awful tribute songs.  Here's a new one called Mama Will Hold Me.  This is from Christy Nelson.  All these are new? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Well, I don't want to look at the words because I took a guess.  I don't want to look at the words because I didn't come home last night.  Close to you, yeah.  And he won't be back next year.  I don't know.  There's an empty place at our table now.  And our eyes are wet with tears.  Good rhyme scheme.  How could I have known what would have been that day when our nation's freedom was tried? 
[03:11:30]  Please.  Are we really free in America?  Well, it just rhymes.  Oh.  Like she rhymed, you're in tears.  A hateful act brought our buildings down.  This is an hour.  And innocent people died.  Oh, Lord, I miss my daddy. 
[03:12:00]  Ro, it's like Christmas shoes, Ro.  This is so sad, Ro.  You rhymed me with me?  Yeah.  That can't be done.  Oh, boy.  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[03:12:30]  When he waved goodbye, I never thought that's the last of him I'd seen.  Of course he didn't.  And when he drove away to work that day, my dad was leaving me.  No, wait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was this a girl whose father died?  It better have been. 
[03:13:00]  It better have been.  I don't know.  Because if it's not, then she's just kind of, you know, I won't goof on her if, you know.  No, that's just sad.  I don't know why I'm like, it took me fucking eight verses to kind of figure that out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm thinking.  You know, what happened up here when, oh, Lord, I miss my daddy.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Really?  What did you think it was?  Her friggin' pimp was inside?  No, no, no, no, no.  But do you remember when all these songs were coming in about Lacey Peterson?  Yeah.  They were kind of singing from the point of view of like, Mama, this is for you. 
[03:13:30]  It was awful.  Is there a Nelson on the list?  Because this is Christy Nelson.  I'm sure.  I mean, it starts with Daddy didn't come home last night.  But it could have just been, well, I'm saying she could have been singing from the perspective  of somebody.  Yeah, why don't you look up the list here, because I don't want to make fun of her.  Why don't we start with, why don't we go on to Through Their Eyes?  Through Their Eyes?  Bad joke there.  Who's that?  Well, it's an instrumental.  Instrumental? 
[03:14:00]  He created this tribute for himself, his family, and friends to deal with the pain of 9-11.  Peter lost a colleague at the World Trade Center.  Colleague?  He's from Toronto, Canada.  What the hell is that?  Holy fuck!  Oh my God!  Hey, this song's got bad language.  Jesus fucking Christ!  Oh my God!  Yeah, it's pretty much the reaction.  Yeah.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh no! 
[03:14:30]  There's people leaving the PNC show.  And then it's this.  He could have probably had a different clip.  Instead of that bad acting?  But if you're going to have like audio, have audio you can play on the radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Fuck!  Holy shit!  And then it's a sad platoon music.  The other one, guys, I think this chick was like 14 then. 
[03:15:00]  I saw her on Larry King.  Oh, all right.  So.  What happened?  The first song we played.  You taking a listener's word for it?  I'm just saying.  I don't know.  It's, uh...  Yeah, it's someone I don't really recognize, so you're right.  All right, then it's this for four minutes.  I feel bad.  Why?  Because she's...  We didn't really make fun of her.  You weren't making fun of anything?  You made fun of her? 
[03:15:30]  What'd you say, Jimmy?  I don't remember.  I was making fun of the rhyme scheme and shit.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you should.  I mean...  She's got a little tragedy in her life like that.  Doesn't mean that she's going to rhyme very well.  Or goodly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about...  Do we really want to do this?  Where were you?  My thing with making fun of the stupid songs is from musicians who are trying to be deep  and poignant and somehow use the tragedy to show that they're these deep artists. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  Well, not even that, Jimmy.  They use the tragedy to get some fame for themselves.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  But not a girl who's just writing a tribute to her father.  That's depressing, I said.  Yeah.  Originally, it was making fun of artists, prep services, and radio shows.  Thank you, E-Rock.  And playing the rhyme game.  We know that.  Freedom Fell.  The original song was written by Jay Fiegel. 
[03:16:30]  Credits to Jay Fiegel.  Recording and produced at KHCA, Angel 95 FM, Manhattan, Kansas.  The Little Apple.  It's the Little Apple.  It's not.  Oh, boy.  Freedom Fell.  Freedom Fell.  And now we're getting some bad songs. 
[03:17:00]  Good.  This guy's awful.  He's atrocious.  Time for a breath.  Crash test dummies. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, that's awful.  But lyrically, he's horrendous.  Yeah.  I didn't feel the pain.  Got me denied.  I got you paid out.  I got you paid out.  He's like, where were you when the world died?  I would have cried.  I had nothing left inside.  Well, then why didn't you?  Where were you?  How about just keeping the focus on yourself? 
[03:18:00]  Where were you when the world died?  It needs more effect on the voice.  Take your music lessons.  Rob from Patrick.  A more reverb and chorus echo.  Rob from Patrick.  Patrick.  Was this song recorded underwater?  Yes.  Want to play the next one?  Patrick.  Where is that?  It's Patrick.  Oh, okay.  But my fiancee is not from Long Island.  Oh, does she say Patrick Waugh and Hoppa Goa?  Yeah.  No, she doesn't. 
[03:18:30]  That's funny.  Because that's how it's spelled.  Patrick Waugh?  Yeah.  She doesn't know it's Patchogue.  She's not local to Long Island.  I know, but I'm not from Massachusetts.  But I know it's not Massachusetts.  Oh, yes, it is.  Worrester.  Worrester.  Worrester.  Let's go with Walking Amongst the Ashes.  What's this?  He was there, but I couldn't see him. 
[03:19:00]  There was all that smoke, too many broken dreams.  I don't have a smoke.  In the midst of that terrible scene.  He was walking amongst the ashes.  Money for nothing and your chicks for free.  Yeah.  Yeah, almost Tom Petty sounding.  I hear Dire Straits.  That's a little Knoppler guitar, man.  He was walking amongst the ashes.  There had been too much of everything. 
[03:19:30]  Too much of everything.  The nightjackers from our past.  They've had a claim on humanity.  The dynamism straight to the party.  The vital calls from those who would be part.  Feeling low.  Feeling ashamed.  Feeling guilty for those who were not to blame.  He was walking amongst the ashes. 
[03:20:00]  Life can be so bittersweet.  I was walking amongst the ashes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  This guy should be walking amongst the ashes of his burned songwriting book.  It's, it's, it's like, it's terrible. 
[03:20:30]  Horrid.  Yes, yes.  It's horrible.  It's like incomprehensibly bad that you would like, not only did he write this, but he had  to proofread it and he went, yes, those are the words.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  That's what I want.  He sang it and listened to it.  Yeah.  Why don't we go with The Legacy by Doug Champagne from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  The Legacy is our tribute to those who needlessly perished and to those who survived and must 
[03:21:00]  live each day in anguish at the loss of a loved one following the events of that horrific  day.  We hope that you enjoy the song we have put together, from our hearts to yours.  Better hope.  Hate it.  The Legacy.  What?  Moving so far.  By Doug Champagne.  Christopher Cross.  Your name stinks.  We're not terrible.  Red Barn. 
[03:21:30]  It's going to be all country.  Dude, if you want to have a good laugh, man, this XM, I saw what it could do on the way  back from the Outer Banks.  Yeah.  Go to, I think, Highway 16.  The shit they sing about on that fucking station is hilarious.  Oh, yeah?  Whole song about a red barn.  I don't know what the song's called.  But it was hilarious how simple the lyrics are on those country songs.  Can we play the rhyme game?  We haven't played that in years.  Here we go.  Yeah.  The Legacy.  Here we go. 
[03:22:00]  September 11, 2001.  The day we lost our daughters.  Yeah, of course.  And we drank a lot of cum.  No.  It's something about sons.  Oh.  Or he'll rip the daughters.  The day we lost our daughters.  Our daughters and our sons.  Yeah, something stupid like that.  But it's definitely sons because it's got to be hokey. 
[03:22:30]  2001.  The day we lost our daughters.  The day we lost our sons.  Thank you.  In three separate acts of terror.  Murder or murder, most would say.  Our lives.  Something about, yeah, our lives.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, changed that day.  Would never be the same.  Be the same that day. 
[03:23:00]  It's going to be day.  I was so upset.  I sucked a dick and I turned gay.  All right.  That could be.  Now you got me thinking.  There's no wrong answers, Jimmy.  Attaboy.  There's no strangers.  Only friends we haven't met yet.  High five, high five.  High five.  That's our new thing.  High five.  Alanis Morissette.  High five.  What's here?  I'm curious.  Acts of terror.  Or murder, most would say. 
[03:23:30]  Our lives were changed forever.  Upon that fateful day.  Upon.  Jimmy, there was nothing about being gay there.  I was just thinking it was going to be gay.  I didn't know.  Okay.  You were way off.  This is so bad.  I'm trying.  I'm rocking now.  And the heroes, they were plenty.  Some names we'll never know.  Uh, okay.  Da-da-da-da-da. 
[03:24:00]  Uh, turn gay and blow.  No, no.  It's got to be, uh, da-da-da.  We'll never know.  Wait, should we hear the next line first?  Well, I kind of like, like, this is really hard.  Okay, how's it go?  Then some names we'll never know.  Plenty.  And some names we'll never know.  And then...  Picking the team for a kickball.  I'd go eenie.  No.  Me, me, me, my, eenie.  Um.  No. 
[03:24:30]  All right, play the next line.  We'll, we'll see after that one.  I'm going to go with Nat Beheaded.  No.  What?  What happened?  That's funny.  Sorry, who said that?  What?  They were plenty.  Some names we'll never know.  They stood there in the stairwells.  Showing people where to go.  Where, where'd it go?  Ah, I should have known it was going to be go.  They stood there in the stairwells. 
[03:25:00]  I think they did a little more than that.  Yeah, go, go that way.  You know, down.  Down.  Dummy.  Yeah, if you're in a stairwell.  This guy stinks.  You already got your direction.  You pretty much know which way to go.  You're at the end of the old...  Yeah.  Map quest.  Yeah, you're pretty much being directed by something called gravity.  Right.  I just don't know.  The men and women of New York, they held their post so well. 
[03:25:30]  Really?  Standing in the darkness.  Stop.  Yeah, in the something about the burning hell.  In that blah, blah, blah, hell.  Jessica's still stuck in that world.  Oh, hair gel.  Swell.  Forget pert. 
[03:26:00]  I use prel.  How's our new boss, Mel?  The darkness until the towers fell.  Oh, fell.  How did we miss that one?  I was thinking fell, but it was Norman.  Jeez.  Oh, Norman fell.  Mr. Roper.  We didn't do that thing that you do when you want to rhyme something. 
[03:26:30]  You know, bell, sell, bell.  L-L-L-L-L.  Bell, yeah.  That was an obvious one that we screwed up.  And other men were on a plane fighting for our lives.  Our?  Some of them picked up their phones and called.  The person who sells them knives.  And called Burl Ives. 
[03:27:00]  Burl Ives, yes.  And wait, and picked up their phones and ate cream cheese with chives.  Wait, what are we trying to rhyme now?  The lives.  Oh, I love.  Picked up their phones.  And ordered McDonald's French fries.  Don't be in that.  I'm trying to. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, right.  Hot.  Did their hair in beehives.  Picked up their phone and did their hair in beehives.  Beehives.  No.  I don't know.  I know it's not wives.  Can we play a Towels, Not a Hat today?  Well, that would be a good time.  Way to end this show today.  All of them picked up their phones and called their loving wives.  Ah. 
[03:28:00]  Why can't we figure this out today?  I don't know.  They're hard.  This guy's really hard.  It's tough.  To tell them that they love them and to say goodbye for the deck was stacked against them.  So they had a ham on RISE.  RISE. 
[03:28:30]  Let's see.  They hid because they were shy.  And Ronnie hopes Earl dies.  He's coming in on Pal Talk.  Very good.  We ready?  Uh-huh.  No.  Wait.  Do you have anything in it?  What was the last line of it?  What was the last word?  I don't know.  I don't know.  To tell the wives goodbye.  I don't know. 
[03:29:00]  Well, the bad guys.  Were they all ate apple pies?  Yeah.  Okay.  Apple pies.  And surely they would die.  Oh.  It's a...  In the Pentagon in Washington, just going about their lives.  Going about.  Hundreds more just did their jobs not knowing they would die. 
[03:29:30]  Would, would, ah.  Now their man's RISE will not leave us.  They did not die in vain.  Oh.  We always will remember.  Uh.  Lady dies.  Husband was hit by a train.  Husband was, uh, where, uh, the smart guy from Escape from New York was brain. 
[03:30:00]  Is that it?  What word are we trying to rhyme?  Us?  Uh, no, no.  Uh, uh, vein.  Oh, vein.  They didn't die in vain.  Vain.  And we always will remember.  Um.  Um.  All of their name.  So.  The front, the front of our pants with a cum stain.  Oh.  Why not? 
[03:30:30]  You never had one?  What, I'm the only one?  Uh, please.  Oh.  I have one.  What is that from?  What's that from?  It's a cum stain.  You think I just improv this stuff?  It's here.  I live it.  It's just real life, kiddo.  Uh.  Big boy has a cumsy stain on his underpants.  It's not in your underpants.  It's on the outside of your jeans, and that, I have every right to say, how did that get  there?  Oh.  Well, who knows?  Maybe the pants were open or something, and I was doing something discreetly? 
[03:31:00]  What's the L line?  Uh.  Um.  They had not died in vain.  Some.  Um.  We will remember.  Remember.  And we will remember.  The song called Chocolate Rain.  Chocolate Rain.  Chocolate Rain.  Pain.  Hmm.  We'll always feel the pain.  Pain.  We suck at this.  Oh, we're so good. 
[03:31:30]  On September 11th.  The year 2001.  Ugh.  The day we lost our daughter.  All right, the sun.  Oh, the, no?  Oh, wait.  As well as a few huns.  What word are we trying to rhyme again?  Oh, the sun.  Oh, sun.  Oh, I can't figure this out.  It's going to be sun again.  Sun.  Um.  What?  He's rhyming 2001. 
[03:32:00]  2001.  Maybe guns?  One.  Hmm.  Shuns?  Hmm.  No.  Not, not much fun.  Iraq has soft buns.  Buns.  All right.  Brozio Toma weighs a ton.  Getting some in, on instant feedback.  The day we lost our son.  Oh, yes.  Of course.  In three seconds.  What?  Brood acts of terror. 
[03:32:30]  Or murder, most would say.  Most.  Our lives were changed forever.  On that, blah, blah, blah.  Upon that fate.  Upon.  Upon.  His apologies.  It's horrible.  Our lives were changed forever.  By the way, maybe we should have read the piece of paper in front of us.  Did you guys all get this?  No.  No.  Christy's song has definitely struck a chord in New York.  It's the most requested song on PLJ by a two-to-one margin.  More requested than Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, NSYNC, Destiny's Child, and the Backstreet Boys. 
[03:33:00]  Are you shitting me?  That's from November 2001.  That's Scott from the Scott and Todd Morning Show.  Well, that's November 2001, of course.  But when did you get that?  I didn't know about that.  Who's singing that?  Which one?  Who sings that song?  Christy.  What?  Christy sings...  Christy.  Which song?  The girl's father died.  Oh, the father died song is the one that's most requested?  Yeah.  Back in November 2001. 
[03:33:30]  Okay.  I thought that...  The last piece of crap we were just playing.  No, no.  Oh, I was confused.  All right, here's We Wear Red, the final one we're going to do today.  Same guy, by the way.  Thank God.  Great musician, though.  Yeah, listen to that.  Pickles the Ivories.
