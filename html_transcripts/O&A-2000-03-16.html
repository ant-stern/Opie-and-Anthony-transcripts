<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Jim Brewer's brief intro, immediately followed by Opie and Anthony discussing their impending vacation.  A call from Scott, Opie's college roommate, promised scandalous tales from their college days, teasing a story involving a "kitchen lady."  The hosts then detailed their plans for a less extravagant final hour broadcast from a local bar, including giveaways. Anthony vented about a disastrous day in the stock market.  They previewed comedian Brian Regan's upcoming appearance, a personal favorite, and confirmed Wayne Corbett as a guest, alongside promotion of their Mountain Dew-sponsored NCAA Final Four contest. A heated, playful argument ensued over their Final Four picks.  They teased a secretly recorded, profanity-laden audio clip of Bobby Knight’s angry rant.

The show then featured several listener calls. Anne-Marie shared a humorous anecdote about attempting to acquire Brian Regan's autograph. Mano, a repeat caller from the previous day, recounted their on-air body hair removal experience, expressing disdain for the women who had visited the studio. Mark called to praise the show, comparing it favorably to other programs on the station. Jenna, another repeat caller, defended herself against Mano's criticism. The ensuing discussion included descriptions of body hair and physical appearance, with numerous insults exchanged. Nicole described her self-shaving experience, while Michelle offered Mano career advice and commentary on their appearance. Tony provided further commentary on the previous day's events and the women who appeared.

The hosts advertised "Stack or Two," a fat burner, and recounted their firing from their previous Boston radio job due to an April Fool's Day prank involving the mayor's supposed death, including the subsequent media fallout.  A caller, John, reminisced about a past on-air fight with a guest. The segment concluded with Air Sick's "Kill a Fetus."

The next segment focused on their negative experiences at WNEW, detailing mismanagement and incompetent marketing decisions, such as a proposed giant Pop-Tart promotion and a Super Bowl party at a listener's home. They criticized the previous marketing director's failure to deliver promised Range Rovers and satellite dishes.  The hosts also accused employees of stealing station memorabilia and gold records.  They highlighted the high salaries of underperforming employees, including one earning $800,000 for announcing song titles. They lamented the station's incoherent plan, referring to it as a "cluster F," and shared a humorous story about their former boss's unrevealed "grand plan."  Their frustration extended to the music selection, criticizing the overuse of Johnny Lang and Jethro Tull, and the cancellation of a double CD release due to legal issues. Listener calls included one from a long-time fan and a prominent call from Brian Regan discussing his career and comedy. The segment ended with an advertisement for Dr. Philotoff's eye surgery and further promotion of Brian Regan's shows.  The segment contained frequent profanity.


The show heavily featured Brian Regan, whose sold-out shows were discussed at length. Callers expressed their appreciation for Regan’s "school bit" and "wrong number" routine; one recounted a humorous experience listening to Regan at a Dairy Barn. Regan himself called in, performing bits.  Other calls included one from a listener who received a ticket for erratic driving while laughing at a Regan bit, and a recurring joke about repeatedly calling Buddy Ebsen to track his apparent health decline. A significant portion focused on a contest to guess how many times Bobby Knight used the "F-word" in a rant clip, which was played repeatedly. NFL player Wayne Chrebet called in, discussing his career and the New York Jets.  The Mountain Dew contest and their stock market performance were briefly mentioned. The segment was highly informal and comedic.

The final segment focused on upcoming concerts, followed by a lengthy anecdote from Anthony about a traffic stop. Anthony recounted his encounter with a New York City traffic agent who lacked knowledge of Massachusetts vehicle registration and insurance, ultimately deciding not to issue a ticket. The conversation transitioned to their aggressive driving habits and "Move of the Day" awards. They played a recording of their driving filled with expletives. The show concluded with a "What's in My Pants" game with a caller, Karen, who successfully tricked them.  Several listener calls about lessons learned from the show followed, ending with an announcement of a post-show gathering at a local bar before their vacation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Jim Brewer, and you listen to the new FM Talk 1027NEW, Opie and Anthony, and they're part of my new class, and we gather every Tuesday, this is the first month, and we talk about our past lives.  And I used to be a butterfly, and I'm flying away. Fly, fly, fly.  Opie and Opie, we punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  We haven't rocked in a while, huh, Anthony? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  That kind of felt good. Stone Temple Pilots in there, sex-type thing from Quark, Kid Rock, and Cowboy from Devil Without a Cause.  If we're going to rock a little bit today, because I think you and I are in vacation mode.  Yeah.  We're two days away from taking a week off.  We're already feeling it. We can't wait to get out of here for a week.  Yeah.  I don't know how it is. 
[00:01:00]  If we're going to rock today a little bit.  I want to play some Power Man 5000.  Oh, yeah?  Hey, one of my old college roommates is on the line.  Oh.  Scott.  Opie.  What's up? I got you live on the air, man.  Excellent.  What's up, bro?  Lake Brother.  Yeah, me and Scott lived with, what, two other guys?  Yeah.  With Scumbag.  With Scumbag near the lake in Geneseo.  Are you in town, man?  No, I'm coming in tomorrow. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, really?  I want to know if we can whoop it up for St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah, we can do that.  All right.  I'll tell you where we're going to be off the air, because it's like a surprise.  Okay.  You want to give Anthony any dirt on me or anything?  Yeah.  Oh, I got a lot of dirt.  I know you do, man.  We can start with the kitchen lady.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What's the kitchen lady?  No, no, no, no.  Come on.  Hey, what's the kitchen lady?  Oh, my God.  I gots to know.  I didn't do the kitchen lady.  Well, you know, we got to save something for later, but I just wanted to know, I got plenty 
[00:02:00]  of stuff, and if we can work this into a regular installment, it could probably go for a year.  Yeah, you probably could.  Remember when we used to get so high and walk out into the middle of that lake in the winter?  Oh, my God.  And you could hear the whole lake cracking underneath you.  But we were so big, we didn't know enough to go back to the shore.  So big, walking on thin ice.  Yeah.  That's great.  No, it wasn't thin ice.  It was western New York.  That ice was like, I don't know, 10 feet deep.  It's frozen six months out of the year.  Hey, Scott, where are you living now? 
[00:02:30]  I'm upstate.  Where am I?  Binghamton.  Oh, you're in the Binghamton area?  All right, cool.  Hold on a line.  We've got to go to a break, and I'll tell you where we're going to be.  All right, hold on.  My old roommate.  Very cool guy.  What's he doing around?  I don't know.  I guess he's in town for business or something.  Hey, look at that.  Because tomorrow, you know it, right?  What we're doing.  Of course you know.  Do I know?  Do I know?  We're in Caddyshack mode.  We just saw Caddyshack before we came on.  That's why we're starting a little late today. 
[00:03:00]  Sit down, Danny.  There were too many lines we had to see for ourselves.  Or I'll find myself a new greenskeeper.  Is that clear?  Yeah, tomorrow's our last day.  Then we're taking a week off, right, Ant?  Yeah.  And a tradition we like to do on this show, we like to leave the show with an hour left  and do the rest of the show from a bar close to the studio.  Yeah, we get on cell phones and just start drinking.  Drinking.  The listeners.  Yeah, we're going to have some megaphones, and we're going to have stuff to give away. 
[00:03:30]  And we're just going to hang and drink beers with you guys.  And it's going to be within two blocks of the radio station.  Yeah, so, you know, I'll be around the area.  Yeah, we don't want to announce the place yet because then you guys are going to expect a lot from us.  And it's just more of a let's hang out for a couple hour type thing.  Yeah.  A couple hours.  It's not one of our road shows where we have 75-year-old strippers and, you know, girls getting up and doing stuff.  But you never know what's going to happen.  And we'll have, like, some T-shirts and stuff to give away.  Yeah.  And we're just going to hang. 
[00:04:00]  We'll announce it tomorrow around, I don't know, 4.30 or so.  So you do have, you know, time to join us if you like.  But just be around the station because it's within two blocks of where we broadcast here, okay?  I'm mixing up my crack open.  I see that.  Matt, you've got to bear with me a minute here.  The coffee has arrived, so let's take a quick break.  Crystal meth.  And then we'll get into the radio show.  The phone line, 212-757-1027.  Fax line, 212-957-9639.  We'll go to the phones next and see what you guys are up to. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, I'm John Stewart.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Today's show, a fabulous game.  Guess which one of them has a rash?  Hello.  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence to this conversation here.  He has no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Hang in there, Anthony.  Damn it.  Anthony's very pissed off right now.  Premature cellulation. 
[00:05:00]  You sold too early today, Anthony.  I sold too early.  I sold my eBay, Opie.  At $199.  It's now at $211.  Thank you.  Calm down.  Okay.  Should we bring the naked girls in to calm you down?  Son of a bitch.  You know what?  No. 
[00:05:30]  I know I'm more of a long-termer.  Yeah.  Last two days, the stock market, just having killer days.  Yesterday...  What a Dow.  I know.  Dow.  Yesterday it closed up, what, $350, $340, somewhere in there?  Yeah.  It's up like over $400 today.  It's up over $400 today.  Most of my stocks are part of Dow.  I've gotten killed the last two days.  Absolutely killed.  While everyone else is jumping up and down and celebrating, I'm watching my stocks plummet 
[00:06:00]  the last two days.  Plummet.  It doesn't make sense.  It's what you have.  I understand the workings of it and all that.  A lot of people have pulled out of the tech stocks and gone into the traditional, the  blue chips and the Dow, pushing the Dow way up, and the NASDAQ's been taking a dump the  past couple of days.  But if you remember last week, the Dow was taking like these three-digit dumps, and the  NASDAQ was up.  And they were going, oh my God, could this be the end of the blue chips as we know it? 
[00:06:30]  Everyone piling money into the techs.  It's, oh my God, if you're in the Dow, you're really going to be nervous.  Now they're saying the opposite.  Well, is the honeymoon over with the techs?  The blue chips.  Oh, by leaps and bounds.  You can't listen to them.  No.  But you should hold on to them a little longer than you did.  Goddamn me.  Damn me.  Look at this.  And how much...  It's retarded.  Come on, you're always bragging when you have a good day. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And being the day trader these days.  I didn't have a bad day.  All right.  I just didn't make as much as I could have.  How much more could you have made today?  If you had a little patience.  If I would have waited a half hour...  A half hour.  A half hour difference was the difference between 2,000 and 8,000.  Half hour.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Ouch, babe.  Goddamn.  Well, it happens, though, you know?  I mean, I played it perfect the other day, and I was all happy, right?  Now look.  Oh, God.  All right, Ant.  Well, listen.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  I am very, very excited today.  Are you?  Probably my favorite comedian is coming in here today.  My favorite comedian that is out there.  Yes. 
[00:08:00]  I didn't know Jay Moore was a comedian until recently.  Jay Moore, of course, our favorite guest.  Right.  My favorite guest of the show is Jay Moore, right?  Yes.  My favorite comedian is going to be walking through those doors today.  And that is?  Brian Regan.  Brian Regan.  Brian Regan.  This guy is goddamn hysterical.  We would play his CD just constantly up in Boston, ride home.  You've got to pop in the Brian Regan.  Yeah, not on the radio.  I mean, we played a few of his tracks just to turn you guys on to Brian Regan a couple weeks ago. 
[00:08:30]  And the guy, I don't know what to say about him.  I mean, he's playing Carolines all weekend, right?  Yeah.  We're going to the show tonight.  I cannot wait.  If you're looking for something to do tonight, and you want to laugh so hard that you're going to wake up tomorrow going,  what the hell is wrong with my ribs?  You'll be incontinent.  You'll be yourself.  Call Carolines before it's too late, because these shows are going to sell out.  I'm telling you.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  And I cannot wait.  When is he coming?  Like 4, 430?  430.  Brian Regan, my favorite comedian.  Guy's good.  Very funny.  And we'll be at the show.  So if you see us, come by and say hi, okay?  Yes.  Also on the show today, I think Wayne Corbett's calling in.  He was supposed to call in yesterday.  Well, we got a little too busy with the shaving of the ass and all that stuff yesterday.  So, yeah.  Wayne Corbett calling around 5 o'clock.  Hofstra grad.  Hofstra in the NCAA.  Mm-hmm.  Hofstra, Hofstra, Hofstra. 
[00:09:30]  Everybody very excited.  One of Anthony's picks for the Final Four.  Yeah, one of Anthony's picks for the Final Four.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hey.  By the way, we've had over 4,000 people sign up for our contest.  Yeah.  4,000 people, you know, signing up, registering to try to figure out who's going to be in the Final Four.  One of those people are going to go to the Final Four live, courtesy of Mountain Dew and us.  Yes.  And what are your four picks again, Anthony?  My four picks are Cincinnati and Hofstra, Iona, and Purdue. 
[00:10:00]  Purdue.  I love their chicken.  It's great.  They don't have the little hairs on them or nothing.  Ah!  All right.  Very funny.  Ah!  We got a very exciting bet for every team that makes it into the Final Four that you pick.  I'm going to give you $200.  Yep.  $200.  And every one of my final, every one of my picks to make it into the Final Four, you're 
[00:10:30]  going to give me $100, Anthony.  That's okay, because I have side bets with other people.  Even if I win, I bet that you wouldn't pay me.  So I'm covered.  Come on!  You bastard.  It's that cruise money.  I wasn't lending my whole family money.  I'd have it for you.  Come on, I just dropped eight grand.  Help me out.  All right, I'll help you out.  My four picks, St. John's.  Oh, make it nine.  UConn.  Syracuse.  Right. 
[00:11:00]  And Duke.  Yeah.  Very conservative picks, I understand, but...  Definitely conservative.  Those are like the favorites, right?  Ah, they're up there.  See?  They're up there.  Mm-hmm.  Syracuse is the goof, because they always fail.  They always fall apart in the tournament.  Duke looking strong.  UConn looking good.  St. John's.  I can't understand why you didn't put St. John's in your Final Four, Anthony.  Uh, because I have no clue about college basketball whatsoever.  Maybe that's why.  All right.  Oh, speaking of college basketball, we're not going to spend a lot of time on it today, 
[00:11:30]  but we do have a great, and I mean great, Bobby Knight clip.  Yeah, this is really funny, man.  This guy lost his effing mind, and, uh, I guess in the locker room, talking to his team?  Yeah.  Who recorded that?  Uh, someone secretly recorded it, because they just had it.  Boy, he must really be pissed that that got out.  Yeah.  So someone, you know, snuck a tape recorder into the locker room, and got Bobby Knight just,  just ripping his team a new A. 
[00:12:00]  He lost his mind.  He is, he uses the F word, I don't even know how many times, we're going to have to count  it.  We're going to have to count how many times he uses the F word, there's a lot of S words  in there.  Yeah.  Just, just a brutal, brutal clip that we're going to do in a little while here, all right?  Now, what seems to be the problem with the team, Opie?  I see, like I said, I know nothing about college basketball.  Have they been losing?  Is it a problem?  Uh, well, there's a, there's a player that, uh, is, uh, is, uh, telling everyone that,  uh, Bobby Knight choked him, Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  There's allegations, uh, Bobby Knight choked him.  Mm-hmm.  And then there's all these, uh, websites, you know, dedicated to Bobby Knight and the  dark side.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Well, he's known for his temper, and his yelling and screaming, and he's known for throwing  chairs, and all this stuff.  Right.  I saw that clip, that was pretty funny.  He throws the chair, a couple of people on the court.  He's just a bastard.  He's like a lunatic.  He's a lunatic.  Yeah.  Of all the schools you could pick to go to, if you're a, a good high school basketball  player, I don't know why you would pick Indiana. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And deal with that crap.  When, when we play this clip, you're not going to believe it.  Yeah, he, he.  We play it right now, by the way, but Rick is, uh, getting all the F words bleeped and  stuff, so.  Ah.  As soon as he's done.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  As soon as he's done with that, we'll, we'll put it on the air.  So.  It should be within the next 10 or 15 minutes, all right?  Cool.  Uh, you want to go to the phones real fast?  Anne's got a good story to tell as well, but a bunch of these people have been waiting,  so we'll, we'll go to your story next, Anne, okay?  All right.  Anne-Marie, what's going on?  Hi.  How are you?  I'm doing good. 
[00:13:30]  Good.  I was so psyched to hear you guys talk about Brian Regan, because I've been following him  for like the longest time, and he is hysterical.  He's the funniest guy I've ever seen in a comedy club.  In fact, one time after the show, I wanted to get his autograph, and I went up to him,  and I said, uh, Camino, can I have your autograph?  And he kind of looked at me funny, like, why?  Yeah.  And I said, oh, come on.  I said, it'll, it'll be funny.  And then he said, well, I don't have anything.  I said, you, you don't have like one of those press photos, like an 8x10 that everybody signs 
[00:14:00]  and stuff?  He goes, no, because what if I have those things printed and nobody wants any?  Then I'm stuck with like a case of pictures of myself that nobody wants.  This guy doesn't understand.  He, he is the, one of the, he's the funniest guy I've seen.  Yeah.  This guy should be huge, and for some reason he's, he's not.  It blows me away.  Might be a good thing.  Keeps him honest, you know?  Yeah, maybe.  And he's funny without, without cursing.  I don't think he curses once in his whole life.  No, he doesn't.  You know?  He doesn't.  He does a bit about, uh, ordering at McDonald's that will just have you peeing in your pants, 
[00:14:30]  man.  No, well, like the one when you're moving, and you got to order boxes.  That one's pretty funny.  Yeah, I cannot wait to go tonight.  Caroline's, I highly recommend everyone get on the phone and get their tickets now.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, he's great.  All right.  Anything else, Anne-Marie?  I'm sorry.  No, that's it.  I cut you off by accident.  No, that's it.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, bye.  Love you.  Love you.  Wow, we got to love you.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Mano from, uh, yesterday's on the line, Anthony.  The Pakistani?  Yes.  Hey, Mano, what's up? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, what's up?  Did you have fun yesterday?  Yeah, but, uh, that girl scared me off.  I had to sneak out afterwards.  I couldn't even say bye to you guys.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, see, we snuck in on you.  No, I snuck in on you.  As soon as the show was over, I took the back way to the office.  Actually, I left before anybody else left.  I just picked up my things and left.  That girl scared me.  She scared you, huh?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, she wanted to come down and, uh, get a taste of you. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't think she was that bad.  Well, after that, my husband had to take me to a bar to get tequila shots.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I had, like, ten shots at least.  Now, did your, um, did your husband like the job we did on your ass?  Yeah, I think so he did.  I got laid.  You got laid?  Yeah.  Everybody, uh, I talked to last night was saying, uh, how heinous was the girl that came in for Mono?  Was I that bad?  Um, no, I, I said you were a nice girl and everything, but you were like a gorilla woman with a lot of hair. 
[00:16:00]  And then the girl that came in that wanted to pleasure you?  Uh-huh.  Um, that was a whole nother story.  Oh, God.  You, you weren't into that, huh?  She was like a muscle chick, though.  I hadn't been, I haven't been with a girl since I've gotten married.  I want to be with a girl, but I'm not that desperate.  She was diesel dyke.  You know what I mean?  I swear.  Holy diesel.  No offense, but when she took off her shirt to show her boobs, her white bra had turned brown. 
[00:16:30]  Like, if she's not pretty, at least give me somebody clean.  Her white bra was brown.  Well, it was gray.  What a coincidence, because your brown ass turned to white after we were there.  Yes.  You changed colors right in front of our eyes after we got all that hair off that ass.  You wanted to shave my back so bad.  Yes.  I haven't seen anybody's face turn red like yours did.  Well, Mano, I mean, there was too much hair on your back. 
[00:17:00]  So?  So?  You were, ah.  Can you do that with your tongue?  No.  Like the rest of the Pakistani whores?  No.  They move their tongues back and forth.  Actually, that's from Iran.  That's not from Pakistan.  Uh-huh.  They do that at weddings.  All right, Mano.  You were a big hit on the show yesterday.  Oh, thanks.  And thanks for helping us out, okay?  No problem.  Anytime.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  No problem.  All right, there she goes, Mano in the hairy lower back. 
[00:17:30]  It's cool.  I was looking at an old anthropology book last night, and I saw Mano in there.  She was the one right before the person that was standing upright.  It was right before that.  She has a lot of confidence, huh?  I guess, yeah.  She's a hairy bitch, and she don't care.  Neither does her hubby.  God bless them both.  Have fun.  Have fun with it.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, you're next on WNEW.  How are you?  Hey, what's up, Child Touchers?  Hey, what up?  How you doing, guys?  As a faithful listener of the show, I just wanted to inform you that last night, on the 
[00:18:00]  way home from the bar, I put on N.E.W., and I think Spaz just told me it was Ron and  Fez.  Okay.  They were doing a whole bit on the Pakistani chick.  They're like, oh, I see what Opie and Anthony do, and why can't we think of stuff like that?  Oh, how her ass changed colors like the chameleon.  And they're like, oh, blah, blah, blah.  I said, that's cool.  It just shows that you guys are the true visionaries and leaders of N.E.W.  Well, see, boy, that's really an honorary position to hold. 
[00:18:30]  You guys are like...  King of the retarded.  That's what we are.  You guys are like the USS Enterprise of N.E.W.  You're the flagship.  I'm going to take that with me when I die, because I'm going to have total consciousness.  Yeah.  Which is nice.  Which is nice.  That's going for me.  Which is nice.  Which is nice.  Cinderella boy.  Well, at least they're not trying to do our bets.  We really appreciate that.  They were kind of like, without you guys, they would have been talking about, I don't  know what they would have been talking about, but...  Computers.  It's great.  I enjoy the show.  I got to tell you. 
[00:19:00]  I really do.  I tune in.  I'm driving home and stuff.  They sounded...  Hey!  They were a little faggy.  Hey!  Rude and rude.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  All right.  Well, thank you, Mark.  We appreciate that.  Thank you very much, guys.  All right, bye.  Peace out, Cub Scout.  All right, cool.  Peace out, Cub Scout.  Everyone's requesting Brian Regan bits. 
[00:19:30]  Don from the city.  Howard taking shots at you today.  I heard him.  He was saying how everyone does radio like him.  But they do not do it as good.  Something to shoot for, I guess, I hope.  But he doesn't say our names.  We're not allowed to comment about that or we'll get in trouble, so...  Or it'll be syndication never.  Here's the girl that turned mono down.  Here's the girl that mono turned down.  Jenna, what's going on?  Oh, God, please.  Let's try to get into this.  What happened?  At least I didn't have to be shaved, all right? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, Jenna, I've got to stick up for you.  I mean, you know, not that you're, like, you know, a beauty queen or anything.  I never said I was Cindy Crawford, but I know I'm not that bad.  Broderick.  But if I was, like, really, really, really, really drunk, had a few shots and maybe some smack...  Oh, come on.  Some smack.  I think I would pick you over mono.  No, see, I just came from the gym, so I was not exactly going to be looking great.  How many...  And how many beers would it take?  Were you mopping the floor?  And how many beers would it take?  Yeah?  How many beers would it take for Jenna? 
[00:20:30]  Seventy.  Seventy?  Three cases.  Well, everybody has their specific types and girls and guys that they're attracted to and like.  And I'm sorry, you know, it just wasn't my type, as, you know...  I wasn't trying to be your type.  I understand.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like, it just...  And apparently you guys didn't see the email I sent you guys with my pictures.  Uh, no.  I didn't get to read email today before the show, but it's just interesting that Mona was  trashing you so hard, because she...  Yeah.  She doesn't have that much to brag about.  I'm sorry.  I'm...  We shaved her...  We shaved her ass. 
[00:21:00]  I mean...  And it wasn't just a little peach fuzz.  There was like hair flying off this damn thing.  Oh, damn.  It was disgusting.  A red mandarin monkey ass full of hair.  Psychomark...  Oh, my God.  Go ahead, guys.  Looked like...  What's his name?  General what?  What was up with ODB filling me up?  Urko?  Urko.  Urko.  It was like General Urko's ass.  Damn her straight to hell.  Unbelievable mono.  Did you see it when she pulled her pants down and leaned over the chair?  That red mandarin hairy ass. 
[00:21:30]  I would hit that.  I'll shoot a tray up in that piece.  Just like Zira.  Or Cornelius.  I couldn't tell.  Poor Stinky had to get an electric razor in there.  It's getting caught like a weed whacker in heavy brush.  It was like someone's going to look like a slut.  It was like that.  Hey, Jenna.  Yeah?  She was also saying that when you showed your boobs, your bra was brown. 
[00:22:00]  I just came from the freaking gym.  I just stressed out.  It was supposed to be a white bra, but it turned brown.  What, do you sweat coffee?  No.  Psychomark says it would take 12 hits of X.  It would take me 50 to hit two hits.  Oh, very good.  All right, Jenna.  I'm sticking up for you.  I didn't think you were...  I could come down there and shut everybody up, because I was having an off day.  I could look a lot better than that normally.  All right.  And that's why I sent the pictures in, but hey, I'm not going to be sweating it.  All right.  Cool, Jenna. 
[00:22:30]  Well, thank you for calling back.  Yeah, well, if anybody is still willing to do the strap-on, I really don't care.  I'll do it.  All right.  Does Rick got your number?  No.  Everybody just shot out of there yesterday.  Do you blame us?  I would have shot out of there, too.  Dude, I swear to God.  We've got to explain this to the listeners, man.  There are days the show ends at like 10 to 7.  There's a lot of hot cash around, and it takes us like an hour and a half to leave the studio.  I swear to God, we left this studio.  We wouldn't have left quicker if the Halon system would have went off. 
[00:23:00]  I swear to God.  We ran out of the studio yesterday.  We ran to the comfort of a cold bottle of Bud in the office.  Well, the exterminator was waiting outside the studio door to get in, so.  God, and we bolted.  We're usually really nice.  We say goodbye to everyone.  Yeah.  I took the back way to the office.  Like, we signed off at, what, 6.52, and I was in the office by 6.52, 30 seconds.  I wasn't, I'm not going to jump to conclusions and say, like, Rick was trying to avoid the people anyway, 
[00:23:30]  but did you have to go out the window and take the ledge on the outside of the building to our office, Rick?  It's a little dangerous.  You could just walk through the waiting area.  All right.  But, Jenna, thank you.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Rick's going to get your number in case a girl wants you to bang her.  All right.  Hold on.  There's Jenna from yesterday. 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  Horrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Hey, Nicole, what's going on?  It's going to make you...  You know, like when men shave their mustache off and, like, their little lower lip is missing?  Whoa, whoa.  What happened? 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  Well, I decided I would...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Back the truck up.  All right.  Start over, Nicole.  Okay.  I decided I would do something special last night, so I went clean down there.  All righty.  You went what for?  But what I found was that, you know how, like, when men have a mustache and they shave  their mustache off and, like, their little lower lip is missing, their upper lip is missing?  Right.  All of a sudden, they look a lot different.  I had the same thing down there.  I was like, wait, where are they?  There's nothing there.  You have no labia majora? 
[00:25:00]  Well, they were so little.  I guess, you know, I was wondering if any other woman had that sort of missing lip problem.  You don't want it to look like when you give a horse a sugar cube?  You ever see his mouth and it's just going...  Yeah, no.  It definitely did not look like that.  So you're saying that the patch accented your area down there.  Yeah, it looks like a baby bottom there right now.  Yeah.  All right.  But it's really soft. 
[00:25:30]  Is it?  Really soft.  Well, can we hear it?  Where are you?  In my car?  Could you play what's the...  Virgin.  Well, hang on.  Thank you, Scotts.  I don't want to crash in my car, though.  All right.  Can you...  Yeah, give us a little.  How about giving us a little?  Is she still there?  Where'd she go?  Nicole?  Did we lose Nicole?  Virgin.  Yeah.  Virgin.  She hung up.  That's kind of a cool story.  Holy Jesus, Palomino. 
[00:26:00]  What's it up to now?  I can't look.  I can't look.  It's a 217.  And lost an S-load today.  I didn't lose.  I just didn't make.  Technically, you lost.  If I would have waited.  Oh, my...  Michelle, what's up?  Hey.  How are you?  First of all, you guys suck.  Thank you.  I called up yesterday, and I forgot to tell you guys.  But I think Mano should think about going into advertising.  Like, she could be the poster girl from there.  Pretty much.  She shaves her whole body, is what it comes down to. 
[00:26:30]  And not for nothing, but what a pig.  Yeah.  Well, she had nice breasts.  She had nice breasts?  Yeah.  Not for nothing.  That was about it.  Yeah, but $1.50.  And they could do the shave, too.  Did he get to see the pictures of Mano, or...?  No, I didn't get to see the pictures.  Oh, okay.  Because I heard she was on Channel 2, you know, with the sign.  Oh, she was the gorilla jumping up and down with the wow sign?  Yeah, that was me yesterday, and I called, and I said that that was her.  Yeah, that was funny, Michelle.  All right, we've got to let you fly, all right?  Can I say hello to my boyfriend, Jeff? 
[00:27:00]  You just did.  Okay, I love you.  I love you.  Bye.  Wow, look at the love in the air tonight.  Oh, no, I think she was saying love to her boyfriend.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry to jump on your stuff there, pal.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Let me tell you, that guy, what is that, Mona, Maura, that hairy wildebeest that you had  on there?  Yeah.  The funniest thing, I'm on the spaz cam yesterday checking it out, and you lifted it up because  she didn't want to be on.  It looks like there's like five of you standing around her looking like you're looking at a 
[00:27:30]  lost baby in a well.  Yeah.  With a pair of shears.  How many Norocos did you guys run from?  Oh, wow.  All I can say is when we were shaving her ass, the hair was just flying off.  Like, you know when you see the footage of the sheeps getting sheared?  Yeah.  And the fur goes all over the place or whatever, the wool?  The fur.  No woman should have to shave her back.  And then that other thing, that behemoth that came in that was just on before complaining,  oh, I just came from the gym.  Like you said, what, is she sweating coffee?  Yeah, I know.  I don't care how much she pretties herself up. 
[00:28:00]  She just maybe looked good enough to give a hummer from, you know?  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  It was a bad day for you guys.  Bad day for stocks, bad day for broads in that office.  No, it was some fun radio yesterday.  Oh, it was great radio.  It was fun radio.  Yeah.  But I'm saying for you guys to have to be there amongst all that, you know, heavy woman  smell and hair flying and, you know.  Well, that's why we ran out of the station right after the show yesterday.  I wanted to say to Ant, does he go on any of those message boards for the stock chat  where people try to run the prices up by lying about hype and stuff?  It is so funny, man.  What's this about? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, you go to the message boards.  There's a few sites.  Like, you know, ragingthis.com.  Yeah, yeah.  Those sites.  And you go to the message boards.  Each stock has a message board.  And people, you could tell the people that are so heavy bought into these stocks, they're  trying to run the price up.  And they are.  Oh, it's great.  I heard this rumor today that, you know, Cisco is going to buy this company out tomorrow.  And then the other ones that are shorted.  And you try to try and plug the price down.  And they want to get into arguments with each other.  They go from sound and educated to, you know, like, oh, yeah, your mother's a whore. 
[00:29:00]  You know, so it takes all the solicitude away.  It doesn't matter.  You know something?  The stock market never used to have people that would get on message boards and say,  your mom's a whore.  I know.  But now, it's great.  It's great, yeah.  Every man is on it now.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks for taking me.  VideoBoss.com.  Syndication now, baby.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  And we've got to take a quick break.  Nicole called back who wants to play a quick round of What's In My Pants, the one that's  in the car.  Yeah.  We'll talk to her next.  And Rick is telling me that the Bobby Knight clip is ready to go.  All right.  You've got to hear the Bobby Knight clip if you haven't heard it yet. 
[00:29:30]  All right?  Yeah.  It's about a minute and a half long.  He rants and he curses.  He's screaming at his players.  Oh, I'm going to be in a minute.  It's some good listening.  Stay there.  Oh, B and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both.  Look at that, weirdo.  1027 WNEW.  That's any stack or two of the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes.  You're going to lose some weight, don't you, out there?  Not you, Opie.  Not personally.  I'm just talking to the peeps.  I understand.  I'm a little pudgy.  I was walking around all over Manhattan before the show today. 
[00:30:00]  I mean, spring's in the air.  Yeah.  And this is the time of year where people are like, oh, man, I've got to lose a few pounds,  man.  I'm going to start wearing the shorts.  What happened?  And the wife beater t-shirts.  I've got to look good out there.  So you need stack or two of the world's strongest fat burner.  It's easy as that.  You take it, 45 minutes later, you're feeling its effects.  It burns the fat, builds lean muscle, helps you get in shape.  Also cuts the cravings to snack that you get during the day, putting Twinkies in your mouth. 
[00:30:30]  Come on.  That's what's putting on the belly and the big thunder thighs and the big fat Hillary Clinton ankles.  Jesus.  Well, you burn it away with stack or two.  Yeah.  A lot of people have been emailing us lately saying, hey, I tried that stack or two and I  want to really thank you guys for turning me on to the stuff.  It's working for me.  So thank you.  Well, if you want it to work for you, give them a call.  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Their phone number is 1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. 
[00:31:00]  For stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, we get these illiterates off the air, please.  We all suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  This station would like to remind you to wake up with you now for the day, to have the  medicine go down, and to call the kettle black, and a rubber meets the road, and then  we'll toss it, paralyze it by me, sir. 
[00:31:30]  Just make a note of it.  And we say, bathroom style, the world alive!  That's great.  What is that?  That's the boys from Air 6.  It's funny, man.  Yeah, man.  I just like to remind you, man.  All right, and we've got to get back to Nicole.  She was on the car phone.  She got cut off.  She was talking about how she went wood floor last night, and she's feeling a little weird 
[00:32:00]  because she feels like her lip is gone now because of that.  Really?  Like, you see those guys, they have a mustache for years and years, and all of a sudden they  take the mustache off, and it looks like they lost their upper lip.  Yeah.  That looks a little weird.  That's what she's feeling right now, and we say, what the hell?  Let's hear what a wood floor sounds like, right?  Yes.  Fresh wood floor.  So, Nicole, you're in the car.  Where are you?  Do I have to say?  Well, all right.  Hillary Clinton lives here.  Ah.  And Martha Stewart's moving here. 
[00:32:30]  Oh.  Okay.  Very good.  And I'm right near the train station.  Oh, you're in Staten Island.  Yeah, right.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  So, you're in your car.  I had to pull over.  All right.  What were you wearing?  Right now, blue jeans and a T-shirt.  Well, you obviously pulled down the blue jeans.  Yeah, and unzipped my belt.  Undid my belt.  Okay, and what kind of...  And pulled my black panties down.  Very nice.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We're ready to hear what a wood floor sounds like.  Okay.  Hang on. 
[00:33:00]  Okay?  All right.  Did you guys hear it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, it sounds like...  What did it sound like?  It sounds like it's rubbing on something rough, but it's just the fact that there's so much  just bare skin covering the receipt.  Yeah, and my husband said that his wood worked really well on the wood floor.  Very good.  Very happy camper.  Now, were you rubbing side to side or up and down?  I was going up and down.  Yeah, let's try side to side real fast before we let you go. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  Hang on.  Here's a school bus.  You're going to have to work in a second.  School bus.  She's got to wait because there's a school bus.  Okay.  Hang on.  Side to side.  Here we go.  Okay.  Okay.  I went side to side.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  See, I would have been tricked.  I would have said mohawk after hearing that.  Really?  Yeah.  Because the noise is a little different.  Yeah, I have to say, I definitely feel...  Oh, God, there comes a police car.  Sugar pie. 
[00:34:00]  Sugar pie?  Sugar pie.  Instead of saying the first word.  Very good.  Instead of saying hair pie.  Exactly.  So I definitely have to say, I understand how men feel when they lose their mustaches after  all these years.  Yeah.  Kind of weird.  Yeah.  We wouldn't know, but...  Yeah, well.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you, Nicole.  Take care.  There she goes, Nicole playing What's in My Pants.  Joe, you're next.  I got to tell you, though, it's better that she shaved and found out that that's what was 
[00:34:30]  going on under the hair, that she had no, like, nothing really hanging there, than shaving  it and, I don't know, looks like one of that kid from the Cosby kids.  Hey, my bubba.  Wubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba, bubba.  Remember him?  Yeah.  You don't want that.  You're safe.  Well, wouldn't that, wouldn't he be on his side?  On his side, yeah.  Or the, like I said before, a horse eating a sugar cube or an apple.  You know when you give a horse an apple, but you don't quite give it to him and he's  reaching his lips and... 
[00:35:00]  You don't want it looking like that, either, because that's really, really bad.  That's no good.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  Not a whole lot.  How you doing?  Great.  Listen, I was just calling because I was trying to find out about that comedian who was playing  tonight that you were mentioning.  Ryan Regan.  Ryan Regan.  Okay, I'm going to try and get there, but while Spaz had me on the phone, I was just  mentioning that I just moved back from New Hampshire a few weeks ago, and I'm driving  on Saksa Coast, and I hear the baby abortion song, and I'm, okay, appalled enough as it 
[00:35:30]  is.  I look over, I'm just looking around, I don't know why I feel embarrassed or whatnot, and  this girl is back to New York, you know?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.  You know what, from a distance it looked like a Barbie doll.  I'm like, is this guy playing with a Barbie doll?  I'm like, what the hell is that?  And I got closer, and I see this little part.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold the phone.  Hold the phone.  Hold on.  I'm in my car right now.  Yeah, hold it, hold it.  Listen, listen closely.  You are on the air, on the radio, live.  You can't say the S word. 
[00:36:00]  You can't say BJ.  You can't say BJ.  Oh!  Yeah, you're breaking all the rules.  Let me summarize.  You moved back to New York, you heard kill a fetus on the radio, you looked at your right  or your left, and a guy's getting roadhead.  Exactly.  All right.  All right.  And you were appalled?  Shocked?  No, no, actually, I think the song was a little more offensive.  I beat at the guy, and he was just sitting back, and I had a feeling, holy moly, it's  hard to drive a standard when you're driving. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, when you're talking on the phone.  But anyhow, he was just smiling, and I think he didn't want to tell her that she was surrounded  by all these other cars, and I think he was like, oh, no, keep going, honey, there's  no one on the road.  Meanwhile, there's like, it's like 4.30.  Anyway, so that's my big, exciting story for you.  All right.  And now you like our radio show, or?  I love your radio show.  I listened to it when I was in New Hampshire.  I got you on 104.1.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  So I'm glad to be back now, because now I can still hear you. 
[00:37:00]  All right, Gerald, we're going to play kill a fetus.  What the hell?  Awesome.  All right.  Thanks for calling in.  I'm going to see you tonight.  Look for me.  I'm a tall blonde.  Okay.  All right.  We'll see you at Brian Regan tonight.  All right, cool.  Caroline.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Bye.  Where do we stand in the most offensive song contest, Ray?  Well, yeah, what happened?  Have we had a little drop-off in entries?  Well, no, actually, we're getting pounded with entries.  It's just, like you guys said, the bar's been set.  The bar's been raised so high, we just can't possibly throw on mediocre songs. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, you can't throw something on inferior, because it's...  You have to be truly offensive.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so, I mean, we're still encouraging you guys to come in, you know, come in, send  your songs in, you know, for the most offensive song contest.  Yeah.  You know, bands out there, or if you're just somebody with a karaoke CD, you want to do  it with just a tape recorder rolling.  We don't care about the quality, as long as you can hear the words.  Send it in.  Yeah, the most offensive song ever contested. 
[00:38:00]  Right, and then we're going to get the finalists, and they're going to play at the next road  show, and then we're going to have our faithful listeners decide which song was the most offensive,  Anthony.  Right.  All right, we got the Bobby Knight clip definitely next, right after commercials, but as we go  to a break here, it's Kill a Fetus from Air Sick.  I can't be a dad, you bitch, I've been had, punch your stomach, fried pliers, they got 
[00:38:30]  stuck, your c*** is bleeding, hangers in your uterus.  Oh, stop, you're crying, I think I hooked the fetus.  Want to kill the fetus?  Just once, I can't get out of their c***. 
[00:39:00]  Please, D&C, psych our little toes and knees.  Zack, Zack, Jack, can't hear the little bones crack.  Lose, hip juice, gonna pull it till it comes loose.  B.O.B. and Anthony.  Theater of the Mindless.  1-2-7-WNEW. 
[00:39:30]  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  Syracuse kicking some serious ass in the first round, Anthony.  Is that one of your picks?  Of course it's one of my picks.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B. 
[00:40:00]  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  B.O.B.  Yeah, I just wanted to thank you guys for sending me straight to hell for listening to that song.  Oh, that's the first time you heard that?  And making me laugh. Oh, my God. Yeah. Unbelievable.  Yeah, that's a sick one.  Well, if you're going to have a most offensive song contest, they're going to get pretty rude, you know?  I guess so. 
[00:40:30]  I'm listening to you guys up in Boston. I'm from Springfield, Mass.  Oh, right on, man.  Remember when you guys got thrown out? That was great.  Yeah, fantastic. That was just a great part of my life.  I was glad that you left, but the joke was funny.  Yeah, that was great for all the listeners in Boston.  It wasn't great for Ant and I.  Yeah, I think Rocco still misses you.  Talk to you later.  All right, man.  Please.  Yeah, and it's almost two years ago that we got fired from Boston.  Yeah, it really is.  That was a quick two years, huh? 
[00:41:00]  It was a quick one year because it's almost April 1st.  And I remember us playing all the clips from when we got fired last year right here on NAW.  Yes.  And that seems like yesterday.  Yeah, if you're a new listener to the Opie and Anthony show, Ant and I had a little radio show in Boston.  Even though we're from here, but we were doing radio up there.  Yeah.  We were quite successful.  And then one day we decided to tell the whole city that the mayor died in a horrible car accident.  Yes, Mayor Menino up in Boston.  He was vacationing in Florida. 
[00:41:30]  So Opie had this brilliant idea.  April Fool's Day, instead of doing the typical April Fool's gags that all the DJs pull.  Hey, if you look out your window at noon, you're going to see a meteor.  You know, waxenarific zoo radio.  So he goes, let's just go all out.  We'll say that the mayor is dead, killed in a car crash in Florida.  I'm like, all right, I'll go along with it.  Well, it turns out he was on a plane on the way back when we said it on the air.  So no one could get in touch with him to see if he was really alive or dead. 
[00:42:00]  He took it very, very badly.  Ah, yeah.  Took his death very badly.  Oh, yeah.  Talked to our bosses.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't think the number one show in Boston could get fired over a little prank.  Oh, a week later.  A week later, we're here at NEW talking to the management here about trying to get a job here.  Yeah.  We were like, one day we were rock stars.  The next day we were homeless.  Yeah.  Oh, man, was that a big fall.  That was not fun whatsoever, man. 
[00:42:30]  Not at all.  Oh, then being followed around by TV crews and all that.  And what would you like to say to the mayor?  That was another thing I think that hurt us.  Like, we might have been able to skate up there if it was handled well after we did it.  But the next day, we're leaving the studio, and the news crew puts a camera in our face  from Channel 4 News and says, what would you like to say to the mayor?  And there's me and Opie looking at the camera laughing.  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  Sorry, I guess.  We looked like we didn't care.  We looked even worse.  And we looked like Bill and Ted.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, we did.  We looked like Bill and Ted.  My hair was a lot longer.  Anthony.  We didn't look sincere at all.  Not at all.  And then they invited us a week later to a beautiful hotel, the Colonnade, down there  in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  Up to the conference room.  Oh, yeah.  On, I guess, the 20th floor Opie overlooking beautiful Boston.  Oh, yeah.  And we sat down at the table where we were told we were fired. 
[00:43:30]  No, we weren't fired.  We were terminated.  Terminated.  We're going to have to terminate your contract.  Like, okay.  Why couldn't you say fired?  Because it's very technical.  Yeah.  And then it turns out the guy that fired us now works, well, we all work for the same  company again.  Oh, how about that?  And we never, ever, ever want to see that guy.  Yeah.  Ever, ever, ever.  Terminator.  He was a real prick to us.  Well, I guess he was just doing his job, Opie.  You know?  What was he supposed to do? 
[00:44:00]  Listen to us?  Listen to what we had to say on our side and then call his boss that told him to fire  us?  It wasn't his decision.  Hey, boss?  Boss?  Yeah, sir.  Yeah, it's a locust.  Yeah, um, look.  Opie and Anthony just talked to me.  No!  Don't fire him.  I just talked to him.  No!  No, they really have a valid point.  I'm fired, too.  What?  You know, he just had a job to do.  But did he have to say terminated?  Um, I'm going to terminate your contract. 
[00:44:30]  He was the terminator.  Yeah.  Didn't even blink.  And that was it.  He didn't have one human emotion in his whole body.  No.  No.  We were convinced if we opened up his suit, uh, his suit coat.  It was a metal.  Machine.  Metal.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Why are we thinking about, uh, what happened two years ago?  Well, because every year when this time rolls around, we start getting that feeling, you  know?  That bad feeling.  And then it was only followed up by more bad feeling, because we sat here at NEW two 
[00:45:00]  years ago, and it was like a mausoleum we walked into.  We came from a real active rock station in Boston.  It was, you know, kind of, uh, kind of fun, cool, have a show up there.  And we come here, and we're just watching fossils walk around.  I was like, oh, but are we at NEW, or do we go, uh, Central Park West?  Is this the Museum of Natural History?  I think I'm looking at the, uh, Brontosaurus exhibit. 
[00:45:30]  Look, it moves.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, that's Scotso.  Put it this way.  The Discovery Channel called, and they, they want, I love Scotso.  Shut up.  Put it this way.  The Discovery Channel called, Anthony?  Yeah.  They're going to be raising a few, uh, a few bodies.  A few of the DJs?  Yes.  Yeah, we walk in here, and, like, we're supposed to be, uh, the people that are going to pull  this station out of the crap hole that it had sunk into for the past few years, and then  all the other jocks hated us.  They still hate us.  They still talk about us behind our backs.  And there's pending litigation. 
[00:46:00]  And, uh, they, they would hang up faxes that came in on the wall.  Yeah.  Faxes on the wall that say, you know, from, from the three listeners any W had at the  time that said, uh, get these guys off the air, shut them off, play the music.  Oh, my God.  Then the jock that came on that followed us every day.  Remember that?  We'd have girls in here taking their clothes, trying to get some kind of interest in the  station again.  And we'd have this fun show, and she would sit her ass down and go, well, now back to 
[00:46:30]  what really counts, the music on every time we do.  Well, my gosh, she's, I'm trying to undermine what we're doing here.  She would say, now that that distraction's out of the way.  That distraction.  She called herself a distraction.  It's time to get the lead out.  And it was just a, it was just a nightmare.  Look at us.  Every time this time of year comes around, we get like this, all reflective.  I'm shivering, man.  I know, because it was a horror.  And then, like, they handed us, uh, the worst afternoon drive show in New York.  Oh, my God. 
[00:47:00]  We were in dead, dead, dead last.  Picture if you were a jock now, given the morning show slot here at NW.  That's how we felt walking into the afternoon slot here.  Dead last.  It was, I believe it was a 1.2 in afternoon drive.  That is horrible.  So we, uh, yeah.  And then we slowly started making headways.  We're moving up in the ratings a little bit.  And then all the jocks would scream and yell at us and say, well, well, you're never going  to beat what I had.  And I had a 2.2. 
[00:47:30]  A 2.2.  Wow.  How about that?  Back in 1979, when this station meant something.  I had a 2.2.  How about that?  I had a 2.2 and the Daily News wrote about me and had my picture in the paper and everything.  Really?  So then the ratings would come out every month and Ant and I would see, like, 1.4.  I'm like, damn it, it's not better than a 2.2.  1.5.  Oh, come on.  1.7.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  1.9.  Oh, oh.  And they would still yell at us.  You're still not at a 2.2.  That was the best afternoon drive I ever saw around here. 
[00:48:00]  And then we got a 2.1.  I'm like, Jesus, just give us, you know, over a 2.2 so I can shut some people up around here.  And then finally, poof.  Yes.  Blasted past the twos.  Thanks to our faithful listeners.  Now we're in the threes.  3.4, to be precise.  Still working our way up, man.  All the good old days.  What was that? 
[00:48:30]  Where did that come from?  John, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  I remember when you guys had that major league fight with Carol Miller on the air?  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  Everyone thought that was a bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard the owner of her voice, man.  She was absolutely pissed.  Remember when we begged her to, like, quit?  Yeah.  We begged her.  We said, we'll get the U-Haul.  We'll get the boxes.  We'll pack up the largest rock and roll library and leave.  And leave. 
[00:49:00]  Take it with you.  And she goes, no.  No, it's all about the music.  She's fighting with you about her age and your age.  And you're going, well, I'm older than you.  And I've been here longer.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys won't let.  Well, knowing what it was about NEW, it didn't matter how good you were on the radio.  Yeah.  It mattered how long you were here.  How long you had your ass in a chair in front of a mic.  That's all that mattered.  Because there were people that were here for, like, 15, 17 years.  And they were considered rookies by the guys that were here 25, 30 years.  And you couldn't imagine. 
[00:49:30]  I knew John Bennett.  The kind of cake these guys were raking in.  Due to pending litigation, no names will be said.  But, oh, my God.  I saw some numbers.  Unbelievable.  Un-effing believable the cake that was being raked in by some of these people.  So, when we came in here.  $800,000.  When we came in here, they felt a little threatened.  You've got to be kidding me.  Someone sat in this chair.  Yeah.  And made $800,000 to play two-fers. 
[00:50:00]  Two-fers.  Two-fers.  Get out of here.  $800,000.  They didn't entertain you.  They said, that was two from Leonard Skinner.  And they got paid $800,000.  Now you're giving all the money this fast.  With board ops.  They didn't even have to push their own buttons.  Nope.  They didn't even have to push the buttons.  All they had to do was, someone turned the mic on for them.  And they said, that was two from Leonard Skinner.  On N.E.W.  On N.E.W.  We got two from the Beatles next.  Coming up.  That was it. 
[00:50:30]  That's all they did.  And then nod.  The board op hits the button.  And there you go.  Cash your check.  Cha.  Ching.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Good old guys.  Hey, Ant.  Yeah.  How's opposing forces?  You finish yet, or what?  Oh, yeah.  Good game?  I finished really quick.  Not as good as the original Half-Life, but pretty good for an add-on.  Hi, guys.  All right, man.  All right, John.  All right.  Later.  Thank you.  Bye.  Alan from Brooklyn.  Did you have to promise N.E.W. that you wouldn't announce Giuliani's death? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Yes, that was brought up.  Very good.  Yeah, but that was with the old regime.  Dealing with that.  The giant Pop-Tart guy.  The stock market guy.  Oh, my God.  The array of characters that would come in here.  I swear to God, I think at one point, they hired a juggling clown for promotions.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what I saw walking in the hallways one time.  Our ice cream PD. 
[00:51:30]  The ice cream cone PD.  It is so much better now.  Hey, dude.  It is so much better now, though.  Guys, you want to broadcast next to a giant yodel?  Well, he was supposed to be the premier marketing director in the business, Anthony.  Remember that?  And the first promotion he suggested for the Opie and Anthony fans, and us, of course, was...  We're going to have you broadcast at Madison Square Garden next to the world's largest Pop-Tart. 
[00:52:00]  No joke here, people.  No joke.  The world's largest Pop-Tart.  You'll get to talk to the chef that cooked it.  You'll get to talk to the people that were responsible for making it, and you could ask them questions.  How much dough did you need to make this Pop-Tart?  What type of fruit filling is it?  How much fruit filling? 
[00:52:30]  And then you can make little jokes about how you might eat the giant Pop-Tart.  And put the gun away.  Put the gun away.  That's where I looked at Anthony and said, Ant, we are effed.  Effed.  We are done.  What did we get ourselves into?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was another thing.  We were told, this guy is the best.  He's going to be able to get us two Range Rovers for a promotion to give away.  Wouldn't the listeners love that?  Wouldn't it be great if we could get on the air and say, hey, we're giving away two Range Rovers.  This is what the deal is and stuff. 
[00:53:00]  This guy couldn't get a Rover from the Pounds.  Never mind Range Rovers.  Don't forget the other promotion he suggested.  And if we did, if he ever did get Range Rovers for the station, he'd be driving it home with the satellite equipment in the back.  And everything else he stole from there.  Bring back your stuff, you stole, you bastard.  You people, listeners out there, you guys were supposed to get, get this, digital satellite dishes. 
[00:53:30]  We had them as prizes.  Where are they now?  On my roof.  How are we supposed to win with people just pilfering?  All the gold records on the walls, where'd they go?  God.  N.E.W. has been here forever.  I want it, dude.  We all know that.  There was some serious memorabilia on these walls and in the closet.  It's all gone.  Gonzo.  The people that got fired took it all.  There's nothing left.  Unbelievable.  And then Ovi and I would come in to do the show every day, wanting so badly to win, to make some kind of a little tick up. 
[00:54:00]  And then we're surrounded by people that are so just out for, like, can I get another paycheck this week?  As long as I check in my box and my check is there, one more week, that's fine.  Oh, yeah.  That guy still calls on the hotline to try to enter contests to win. 
[00:54:30]  On the hotline number.  Jesus.  Enter me.  What's the Super Bowl promo?  Oh, the Super Bowl promo.  Yeah.  Holy cow.  See, God help us.  When you work in this business, right, when you work in this business and you do promotions, we love, first of all, doing the road shows because it's one big party, right, Anthony?  Very fun, yeah.  Besides the fact that Anthony and I absolutely love hanging out with our listeners, love doing the road shows, love getting drunk with everybody, right? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  As far as a radio station goes, it's just great marketing for the radio station to reach as many people as possible when you go out and about, okay?  Right.  So if you're, like, the marketing director of a radio station, you have to come up with these really cool promotions where people are going to show up, right?  Promotions.  And our time, and our time as personalities is very limited, Ant.  We can't, you know, we can't be out every night of the week and stuff, you know what I'm saying?  No, we'd burn out. 
[00:55:30]  So he got the bright idea to have Ant and I go to, like, someone's house for a Super Bowl party.  Now, we had a great time, don't get me wrong, but it was a complete waste of time as far as marketing a radio station goes.  Yeah, because instead of, like, maybe having a Super Bowl party like we did this year where 1,400 people show up, we had to go to someone's house where 20 people were hanging out.  Half the people had no clue who we were.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like we had been here for a few months, that's all. 
[00:56:00]  So we really didn't have, no one really knew who we were.  This is what we dealt with on a daily basis.  And now, finally, to have a new regime in, and new shows and things happening, we're, you know, they're sending us out.  We're meeting the people.  We're having fun.  But, man, well, first, and we always, this time of year, it always kicks up.  I think it's the smell of spring in the air that reminds us of the nightmare of a couple of years ago.  Oh, my God, reminds me of the stench that was in this studio. 
[00:56:30]  Sitting in that office.  Sitting in that office in the corner of this building.  With our old boss.  Discussing, I have no clue what.  Oh, my God.  The grand plan that he told us.  The reason we actually came here.  Because there was this grand plan.  Oh, he had a plan, he said.  A plan for the station.  So we're like, what's the plan?  Now, I can't tell you yet.  I can't tell you, but believe me, it's big.  It revolves around you guys. 
[00:57:00]  And it is a grand plan.  And if you sign the contract, you'll be able to see the plan.  Look, it's right in front of me.  Oh, can't look.  Don't take a peek.  Don't look too much at the plan.  So we're like, the plan?  What is this, an Amway meeting?  Let me tell you about the plan.  The plan.  So Ann and I are driving home.  So soap.  We were driving home to Long Island at the time going, wow.  They have a plan.  The plan.  This is great.  And I'm like, I saw the plan.  It was right in front of him.  Couldn't read it.  But it looked like it was at least 200 pages long. 
[00:57:30]  That must be one hell of a plan.  It was enough of a bullcrap story that we actually had to think about whether to come  here or go to K-Rock.  It was actually a decision that had to be made.  Yeah.  Like from walking in and looking at the death, walking in these hallways, K-Rock was a no-brainer.  Right.  At the time.  We were going to go there.  Yeah.  At the time.  Right.  And then the plan was introduced.  I'm like, the plan.  Well, what the plan was, was for him to lick ice cream cones while we take a beating. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  And promotions guys to try to get us next to giant pastries.  While we put our souls on the line, he was shopping and getting ice cream.  That was the plan.  It turns out, how long did it take us to realize that there was never a plan?  Never a plan.  I don't even know what he showed us in the office, the big stack of paper.  Paper.  It was just, I think there were blank sheets of paper with a cover sheet.  Yeah.  And he never quite slid the cover sheet off. 
[00:58:30]  It's like, here's the plan.  He hits the table like a phone book.  Boom.  That's a big plan.  I've worked for a lot of radio stations, but I think this guy's got a plan.  And then look at what the, he's had research.  Remember all the research?  Yeah.  Research.  Look at what the research says.  Oh, let me look.  No, can't look.  Oh, oh, oh.  Because it's integrated with the plan.  Yeah.  I don't know what he was researching.  Maybe charms, lollipops, how many licks it takes to get to the chocolate center.  I think he was convinced that if we played more REM that the ratings were going to go up. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, and the music.  Oh, my God.  If I heard another God-effing Johnny Lang song on this station again.  It's so therapeutic to talk about it, though.  It really is.  Oh, we were playing Jethro Tull 2 first.  Wow.  Two years later, though, Ant, we've been here the longest.  Yes, we are now the veterans.  We are the veterans. 
[00:59:30]  Remember that?  Remember that one?  He said that in the job meeting.  Didn't know Zeppelin was big with the listeners.  No, it was funny.  And the one thing we've got to bring up, too, is so then we started NEW.  I've got to say, you know, being a kid from Long Island, it was a dream of mine to work in New York radio.  Yeah, I'm sure with you as well.  Of course.  We worked all over the place, finally got the big shot at New York, and we thought, you know, they would have it together.  That's what it's all about, number one market.  You're coming home to the number one market in the country, to a station that you listened to since you were a kid. 
[01:00:00]  Since you were a fetus.  And Jesus Christ, the same jocks is still there.  Yeah.  So Ant and I get our big break.  We're all excited, and day after day after day, we're slowly but surely realizing that there's, oh, no, there's no plan.  Yeah.  There was no plan whatsoever.  And then Ant and I were commuting back to the island at the time, and finally, Ant and I wouldn't talk about it because we were just like, we were shocked.  We were too afraid.  You know what it was, too?  There was fear that if one of us mentioned it, it would confirm it with the other one that there was no plan. 
[01:00:30]  We were effed.  So we wanted to believe it for a little while longer until one day on the ride home.  Well, it went week after week, though.  This absolutely happened.  I swear to God this is true.  Week after week, you know, we're like, well, maybe this is the week of the plan.  Maybe he just needed time to unveil the plan.  And he'd do things in cluster F fashion.  Like one day, he'd enact part of, I guess, what was the plan, and it would be this assault on a radio station around the city, let's say.  And we'd record bumpers for it, and people were hired to put this stuff together, and money was pumped in, and he was so enthusiastic at these jock meetings and everything. 
[01:01:00]  The next day, oh, we're not going with that.  Right.  It's like, wait a minute.  What do you mean?  You just dumped all kinds of time and money into this.  I thought that was the plan.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  That was something that, but you've got to see what I'm doing now.  Right.  And we'd be, oh, okay.  Well, maybe part of the plan was to alter the plan.  Right, so this went on week after week after week. 
[01:01:30]  We're driving home to the island, just miserable, because you guys don't even understand what we gave up.  Yeah.  I mean, now we're very happy to be here, trust me, because it's drastically changed.  But at the time, we're like, this just blows.  And then finally, I looked at Ann.  He was driving, and I go, Ann, there's no plan.  There's no plan.  I went, oh, my God, I've been thinking the same thing.  That guy doesn't have an effing clue.  And Hope's like, no, nothing.  Nothing.  Our show is being run into the ground.  And I'm like, you're absolutely right.  I've been thinking the same thing. 
[01:02:00]  And then, I guess, for the next 10, 12 miles, we cried.  Yeah.  We wept openly.  Yeah.  And then we decided we were just going to do our show.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  And from that point on, we didn't listen to the Pop-Tart guy.  Right.  Or the ice cream cone guy.  Right.  Or anyone else.  And we got results.  And you guys finally started listening to us.  And we thank you very much for that.  Now we have bosses that support what we do.  Instead of running in fear and telling us to stop, they figure out a way that we can do what we want to do. 
[01:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we definitely appreciate that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm reliving it.  I'm getting palpitations.  Jesus Christ.  We should explain the whole CD thing, too.  Don't worry about the lawyers.  That catchphrase.  The most famous quote ever.  Don't worry about the lawyers.  Ever muttered to Opie and Anthony, don't worry about the lawyers.  Hey, don't worry about the lawyers.  No, everything's taken care of.  Things coming out next week. 
[01:03:00]  Working on.  Everything's fine.  We had a double CD.  What?  We had a double CD ready to go.  How's my Amex?  How's my Cisco?  Right.  Man, we had a double CD ready to go.  Yeah.  We found out the day we were supposed to send it to the CD plant to get pressed.  Yeah.  That the lawyers were flying up from Washington because that was the day they found out that  you and I were putting out a CD.  Shouldn't they maybe have heard it earlier?  You asked him a million times.  I asked him a million times. 
[01:03:30]  What about the lawyers?  Don't worry about the lawyers.  I'll get it past them.  I'll get it past them.  Boss, how's the CD gone?  There's a problem.  A problem?  What do you mean a problem?  Maybe the color isn't good enough on the cover.  We could go down and work it out and maybe get a better tone on the cover.  No, no.  There's a big problem.  Oh, big problem.  Oh, well, some of the tracks have to be rearranged maybe?  Time constraints?  Maybe we have to, you know, drop a track or add a new one in it?  No, there is no CD anymore.  Oh, okay. 
[01:04:00]  No, that's great.  Okay, fine.  It was supposed to go to the plant that day.  That day.  That day.  Hmm.  Hmm.  And it's supposed to be pressed.  Hmm.  Then it turns out the lawyers have a problem with 61 out of the 67 tracks.  Guys, yeah, there's a huge problem.  The CD's not coming out.  But, oh, wait a minute.  Hold it.  Bigger problem.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Please hold.  Yeah, three scoops of the nut mocha.  Yeah, and top it off with vanilla.  Thank you.  Now, what were we talking about? 
[01:04:30]  So that's what happened to our CD.  And, oh, hold on.  Hold on.  O.B. Anthony, hold on.  Please.  Chocolate sprinkles.  Yes, chocolate sprinkles.  Yep, yep, yep.  But the new bosses, they've only been here like three months.  Yeah.  Not even, really.  A little over two.  Yeah.  We are now starting to work on the CD again.  But that thing was done.  That was done.  It would have been one of the hottest selling CDs in New York.  I have no doubt in my mind. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I did have, whatever.  That's not too long to get into, but you're right.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Well, no, I've got to tell you, it's easy to be duped by pure evil.  You know what I mean?  So a couple of times, it almost looked like things were going to happen, things were going  to turn around or something, but they never get it.  All right.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  Yeah, I'm just saying, I hear people saying, oh, I've been listening so long, but I don't 
[01:05:30]  believe them.  I've been a fan since I heard the Da Da Da song.  Da Da Dave.  Da Da Dave.  We love that one.  That's another retard.  Well, first you had the regular version, and then your boss called in and said, are you  entering the gay zone?  Yeah.  And then you made the gay zone version.  Oh, let me find that.  Oh, if you play that, forget about it.  All right.  We'll play that as we go to commercials here.  Thank you, Brian.  Who else listens longer than that?  No one, Brian.  Yeah, I'm the man.  You're the longest listener we have. 
[01:06:00]  Thank you, Brian.  Hey, Chris, good concert last night, right?  All right.  I missed something there.  All right.  He's talking to a friend, I think, over our very own airwaves.  All right.  And Da Da Dave is legendary.  Yes.  This is another retard boss we had.  Jesus Christ.  This guy was just inept.  I loved it.  Great.  This was our boss from Boston.  What? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, bring that up real fast.  That's hysterical.  On a weekly basis.  Yeah, because I've got to give Rick a lot of credit for not, like, going postal.  On a weekly basis, our old boss would bring in people to audition for Rick's job.  Right in front of him.  Right in front of Rick, while Rick was here.  Like, he'd send out, um, he'd, like, send out a casting call for producers of the O&A show.  Please show up. 
[01:07:00]  You will be interviewed.  And Rick is walking the halls watching this parade of people come in for his job.  Interviewing for his job.  Right in front of him.  And some of the people that our boss would get is, like, the same, I think he used the same formula he used to, uh, pick the promotions guy who had never, ever done radio promotions.  Some of the people that came through here.  J people.  And people from wacky zoo shows.  And I looked at half these people and I'm like, oh, the red-haired chick.  I think he just picked. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, the red-haired chick that he wanted to have sex with.  Yeah, I, I, I think, I think.  Oh, my God, that's another story.  We want the lunch.  In my humble opinion, I believe he just wanted to bang her.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  We're not sure, but.  Oh, my God, the lunch where we're just sitting there.  We're like, when are we going to start talking about the radio show instead of, you know, how much of a horse she is?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, wasn't she talking about sucking it?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  All kinds of stuff.  It's like, oh, that's, I'll be a great producer of the show. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, could you get out from under the console and maybe phone a guest or something?  No, I mean, it's great.  It feels great and everything, but could you just get a guest?  But we want, we want our radio show to survive a little longer.  Yeah, yeah.  This is how bad it got at some points.  I'd be there three and a half, four hours before the show starts.  Yeah.  Pulling stuff together, calling people, putting a whole, putting a whole package together for you guys.  You know, so you have stuff.  Then all of a sudden, about a half hour before.  Yeah.  Look, he just dumped out. 
[01:08:30]  The ex-boss.  The ex-boss, yeah.  Would call me into his office and go, oh, by the way, you can go home.  Oh, yeah, because a couple of these guys actually had a guest producer spot on our show.  Yeah.  They were able to sit in and try to do the show with us.  Yeah.  Right.  On that day.  So he would send Rick home so this replacement could come in and hang out.  Right.  And I would look at half these people.  I'm like, could you guys, could you put down the coat for ten minutes and do the radio show, please? 
[01:09:00]  God, what a mess.  What a pisser, man.  Absolute mess.  I'm so glad it's over.  Yeah.  All right.  We got the Dodd-Dod Dave here.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  Yeah, what's up, Mike?  A long-time listener from Boston.  Oh, cool.  Wanted to know any chances of trying to revive that TV show that you were doing up there.  Oh, we had a really good TV show.  Real Rock TV.  Real Rock TV with O&A. 
[01:09:30]  The only English-speaking show on the Spanish channel.  Yeah.  How many times did it ever get on the air?  It was on every week.  Every week, every Saturday.  It was on every Saturday night.  A lot of times it was being preempted, or you weren't able to get it on.  Yeah, well, we had problems.  It was a fun show to do, though.  Well, thank you, Mike.  Mike?  Yeah.  Any chances to get it going again?  What are you kidding?  We could barely have the show every day here.  We're lucky if we're on the air on a daily basis.  We'll see. 
[01:10:00]  We're working on things.  Okay.  Thank you, Mike.  Okay.  You guys suck.  All right, yeah, we better take a break.  We're running really late.  All right.  Boy, that was so much fun reflecting.  I feel much better now.  Where's the therapist?  Who do I have to pay?  Yeah, I feel much better.  I'm getting that off my chest again.  I do have to say, it's so much better around here.  We have surrounded ourselves with people we really, really like, finally.  Yeah.  And everyone else has been fired.  Just about.  Just about.  The less firing will occur to each other.  And everyone else?  Everyone else?  All the new people aboard? 
[01:10:30]  Just stay on your toes.  That's right.  Don't you F up and drop the ball.  That's right.  You don't want to get the rap.  Don't do Anthony's impressions.  Thank you.  Don't go out for ice cream.  Hey, Ant, as we go to break, we got some audio of the retard we worked with.  Worked for, I guess, in Boston.  Yeah.  This is the famous Da Da Dave.  He was too scared when we did something bad to come down to the studio and scold us.  So he'd call us.  He would call us because he thought it was safer that way. 
[01:11:00]  This is called Da Da Dave.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to.  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone, and we all know where that leads. 
[01:11:30]  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun, but you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay-day-day zone.  Wanted to, you know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Oh.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  You know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Huh.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road.  You're doing that.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky, licky.  What's the real dirt road?  Pokey pokey in the butt. 
[01:12:30]  Going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Going into the gay zone.  Not really.  Going into the gay-day-day zone.  Wanted to, uh, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, lick.  Licky, licky, licky, pokey, pokey, in the butt.  Licky, licky, yeah, it's fun.  Licky, licky, yeah, it's fun.  Pokey, pokey, in the butt.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, those guys are fun!  187 WNEW.  Yeah!  Hey, listen to the excitement in my voice, Anthony.  What did I say about our next guest an hour ago, Anthony?  What did I say?  You said, who is he?  Your favorite comedian.  My favorite comedian, without a doubt.  Man, thank you.  Funniest guy you'll ever see in a club.  Thank you so much, man. 
[01:13:30]  And he works clean.  So, Ryan Regan, be funny.  Oh, my God.  Just kidding.  Be funny now!  Now!  Be funny immediately!  You know, it's like when you're on a flight.  I dread when the person next to you gets to that, what do you do for a living question.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because you can either lie, and then you've got to back up a lie, which could be six hours  of torture.  I backed up a lie before it sucked, you know?  Or else you can tell the truth, which is as torturous, if not more, you know?  Because once you say, you know, you're a comedian, they just kind of look at you. 
[01:14:00]  They always, like, cock their head back, you know?  It's always like, well, you know, even if they don't say it, the attitude is, well, it's  time to prove this comedy thing to me.  Start to comede.  Prove it to me, because I'm in the window seat.  You know?  Who are you?  I had a guy who talked to me one time.  You know, he had seen me perform at Dangerfields here in New York years ago, and he was getting  on a flight, and he recognized me from that. 
[01:14:30]  He wasn't even sitting next to me.  He was sitting behind me.  You know how high those seats are.  Yeah, he does.  And the guy wanted to have a conversation with me for the whole flight, you know?  Hey, have you ever met Rodney Dangerfield?  You know, he can see, like, my eyebrows.  Well, you know, he does come into the club sometimes.  What's he like?  Can we stop talking?  Can we stop talking?  You've got to do that thing where you just kind of cock your head.  You still can't see him.  I don't know why you can bother turning your head a little bit.  Are you enjoying looking at my hairline? 
[01:15:00]  Put the seat back and shrug his legs.  Yeah, it's like always that one that you think is the last question.  You know, there's like a little bit of a pause where, oh, man, maybe we're done here.  Yeah, you know, does he do time when he comes in to Dangerfields?  Why don't you go to Dangerfields and find out?  Put yourself and leave me the F alone.  Oh, man.  That's in the show tonight at Caroline's.  Yeah, Brian Regan at Caroline's tonight for an 8 o'clock show, tomorrow for two shows, 
[01:15:30]  Saturday for two shows, Sunday for a show.  Call Caroline's for Ticket Info.  But we highly, and I mean highly, recommend you go see Brian Regan.  I'm going.  Man.  That's for sure.  You were here like a while ago when we first, and it's funny that you're in here today  because we were just having a little retrospective on our career here at N.E.W.  Mm-hmm.  And we were here for about.  We were here for about eight minutes when I was here.  True.  When I was here.  I believe you were our first guest ever on the show. 
[01:16:00]  In New York, yeah.  Yeah.  And you were part of every phone call that would come in.  Apparently.  Yes, we're new here at N.E.W., the new guys.  Hi, how you doing?  All right, you suck.  F you.  Put on some Skinner.  Shut up.  Shut up and play the music.  Screw you.  You suck.  Hey, Brian, you're really funny.  Screw you, O.K. and Anthony.  You suck.  Play some tall.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is about people that just can't handle anything new, you know?  Yeah.  It's like we're new.  We're the new radio guys here at this hour. 
[01:16:30]  You are not what we are used to.  Hello?  Hello?  I'm sitting here and I'm used to something and this is different from that.  So stop the differentness.  Isn't that right, honey?  She's nodding yes.  Yeah.  So we put up with that, which was really fun.  Yeah.  Things have drastically changed, Brian.  We don't play any music anymore. 
[01:17:00]  No music?  No.  No.  Any W, the rock of New York?  We don't play music anymore.  Oh, no.  Are you allowed to, you know, just break in the song yourselves?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think we've done that.  We had a clip of Opie singing yesterday and it wasn't very attractive.  I'll tell you the truth.  And then people are calling, that is not what we're used to.  Please shut up.  You normally don't do that, so don't do that.  This is not what I'm used to.  This is different from what my normal daily experience is. 
[01:17:30]  It's like everything else in my life.  That's Brian from year and a half ago.  Boys from the past.  We have played that clip.  Has to be a hundred times.  Oh, man.  Has to be a hundred times, man.  So no music.  You get to just sit here and talk about the day.  Just yap and trade stocks.  Pretty much, yeah.  We don't even talk about the day, usually, no. 
[01:18:00]  Every once in a while you realize the mic is on.  You got to come over and say something.  Sometimes an inadvertent curse goes out over.  That's why they put us.  Since you were here, we weren't even on a delay when you were here.  We are now on, I swear to God, I drive home, I listen to the joke.  That's how much of a delay they have put us on now.  About 40 seconds.  So, like, if I said, uh...  Whoa!  We almost didn't get that.  See, uh...  What did you say? 
[01:18:30]  See, we're on a very long delay.  Not only us, but there's a guy in a room down the hall, swear to God, who has two more buttons.  I actually walk by that room.  It's like a big, giant, round button.  It's about three feet in diameter.  And he just sits here and hits it every time.  He hits it.  Every time you hear something bad coming through.  It's a circle.  So that's...  Press the button.  That's what we've been up to the past, uh...  Couple of years.  What have you been doing?  Touring around?  I want to curse. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, see, it was fun, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was fun.  I watched you do that, and I could...  You know, it just seemed like...  You never curse.  No, I don't.  We'll give you a curse.  Yeah, go ahead.  Opie, get ready on the button.  No, but make it good.  Yeah.  If you're going to curse, make it good.  Because the three people on hold will hear that.  I just want to make sure that they're on the button, because...  Oh, you can't be fine by the FCC.  Damn!  Whoa!  Uh-oh.  I hope they got that.  I hope they got that, because... 
[01:19:30]  You're out there, man.  Well, I feel bad, because it ain't...  You know, you guys would be the ones off the air.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, that's okay.  If that were to slip through.  Ah, the electronic equipment never, ever fails.  That's a wonder of technology.  So what are you doing?  You know?  I had a guy...  I do work clean.  I had a guy come up to me after a show one time.  I used the expression, um...  Pissed off.  I don't even know if I can say that here.  Oh, yeah.  You can say pissed off.  Which I thought was, you know, within the parameters of cleanliness. 
[01:20:00]  All of a sudden, this guy came up to me after the show just shaking his head no, saying, you know, I've always appreciated the fact that you work clean.  Oh, my God.  I brought my, uh, my sister out.  She likes clean comedy.  And you had to say pissed off.  That's a little lot.  I don't know what to do, you know.  And I actually ended up taking it out of my act.  You know, I was like, man, I'm offending people left and right with my language. 
[01:20:30]  You're crazy.  It's like Showtime at the Apollo with you.  I am out there.  Riding the edge without a helmet.  No more that language.  If you come out, you're going to be hearing that kind of talk.  Doesn't work, Blue.  No.  Mm-mm.  I woke up the next day after seeing you, and I couldn't breathe.  My ribs hurt.  I was laughing so hard.  Thanks.  She was beat up after you left.  That was it.  Yeah, I got my jackpot.  I got mad at your language or something and left the club beating everybody senseless. 
[01:21:00]  It was amazing.  Did you hear what you said?  Pissed off.  I got to hit you now.  I brought my favorite nun.  And he uses that kind of language.  Somebody's going to pay.  Is that what the case is now in the audience?  Because a lot of comics don't work clean.  So you must get everybody that can only see clean comics.  There's busloads of handicapped children, nuns.  What?  I don't know why.  They would need it to be clean. 
[01:21:30]  Yes, you know how they like clean comics.  Actually, I don't really promote the fact that it's clean because then people think it's like...  Religious.  Yeah, you know that it's like really not too on a wholesome side.  You know, and it's like I like to think what I do is, you know, I don't know.  I don't want to pat myself on the back.  I was going to use the word good, but...  Good.  Self-serving.  I think it's adequate.  I'm good.  That's what I tell clubs to put out on the marquee. 
[01:22:00]  Adequate comedy.  He's good.  Brian Regan.  I'm good.  Yeah, like how they have...  How they have reporters and names of critics that say how the act was.  Just put Brian Regan.  Brian Regan says, I'm good.  Oh, no.  Make the retard face.  Put it on a poster.  And have it outside the comedy clubs.  I'm good.  I'm going to come out as being cocky now.  I hope they hit the delay button on that, you know.  Oh, cocky? 
[01:22:30]  No, you still haven't...  No, good.  I don't want to be saying that.  I'm all right, I guess.  Adequate.  Yeah.  Adequate.  Adequate comedy.  More than adequate.  My God, man.  Anyway.  You're trying to sell some seats over here.  They're probably...  For the love of God.  Caroline's listening.  Oh, my God.  He's saying he's adequate.  People are calling to cancel.  You know, we were going to go see that guy, but adequate?  I mean, is that worth a Saturday night? 
[01:23:00]  Do you have someone coming in that's a little more mediocre?  Is that an adequate guy coming back to town soon?  I never felt such an adequate choice.  So, you know, hopefully people, you know, do a little chuckling or whatever.  Sure.  They will.  They certainly will.  We had a whole discussion because of you.  We played one of your tracks off your CD.  Are you still selling that CD anywhere?  Because I had to order the damn thing.  Yeah, you can get it on the Internet and stuff like that. 
[01:23:30]  And it's also in certain, you know, like, certain music stores.  Yeah, one of the funniest CDs you'll ever hear.  But there's an Evel Knievel bit on there that made us discuss Evel Knievel all afternoon long.  Well, we probably grew up around the same time, so Evel Knievel was a huge thing on TV.  We had a discussion, Ryan.  Who is cooler, Evel Knievel or his son, Robbie?  I mean, we just figured Robbie's a...  I don't know.  He's a puss.  He doesn't jump like his father.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the father just didn't have shocks.  He didn't have a ramp, really. 
[01:24:00]  Computerized ramp, so they know exactly the angle.  Evel just set up some plywood on a fence and then flopped on the concrete for a while.  I like the bales of hay at the end.  What kind of safety feature is, like, eight stacks of, you know, little squares of hay stacked up at the end, you know?  But they still do it.  Robbie's still there.  Yeah, like, that's going to help you.  He wouldn't have some hay.  Go headlong into that.  When he went up to Grand Canyon, you know, he fell off and... 
[01:24:30]  Don't worry, he hit the hay.  He's all right, ladies and gentlemen.  Pillows off, bales of hay.  Stuff like concrete, for God's sake.  They should take the medians down off the Long Island Expressway and just sack hay.  Hay from here all the way out to the tip of Long Island.  Ooh, that tractor trailer cut me off.  I did 80 into the median.  Thank God it was hay.  Honey, are you nodding off at the wheel?  Sweetie, what are you worried about? 
[01:25:00]  They got hay.  It's all stacked up.  They're replacing the airbag now.  Big bell of hay shoots out of your steering wheel when you hit something.  Well, you know what I think is weird, too, about Robbie Knievel?  First of all, Robbie, I mean, he, you know, that Grand Canyon thing, I saw it repeated the other night.  That was pretty, you know, no parachute, the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how, you know, I don't know how deep it was.  You know, maybe they picked up part of the Grand Canyon that was like three feet deep.  It's going to take another six billion years of water dripping for it to be impressive. 
[01:25:30]  When the Grand Canyon is completed, this would have been an impressive jump.  I think it was deep in the whole nine yards, you know.  But he still wears his dad's clothes when he jumps.  That's what I think is weird.  That's a little weird, yeah.  You know, it's like that 70s red, white, and blue, you know, leather outfit.  Siva Knievel outfit there.  The superhero outfit.  You know what I think?  I don't think the whole Daredevil world is regulated, you know. 
[01:26:00]  There's no governing body.  So they're getting away with murder.  I saw a motorcycle jump show, you know, some Daredevil show,  and they said this guy was going to jump, I think it was like 30 stretch limousines.  Yeah.  And then they show those stretch limousines, and they're all lined up side by side.  They're all touching each other.  Who cares that they're stretched?  You know, aren't Volkswagen bugs about the same way?  You've got to be kidding me.  What does that have to do with anything, you know?  I'm surprised some guy doesn't, like, attempt to jump, like, an entire, like, Amtrak train, you know, 
[01:26:30]  but put the ramps up, like, on the side.  I thought you could do it on a bicycle.  37 cars, ladies and gentlemen.  Either that or we need a governing body for the thrill seekers out there.  There's got to be a body.  All right, let's take a break and breathe.  Our guest today, Brian Regan.  We love Brian Regan.  He's playing Caroline.  I love you guys.  All right, he's playing Caroline tonight. 
[01:27:00]  We highly recommend you guys go.  And I don't go to many shows.  We're going tonight.  That's how good he is.  Oh, man.  So call Caroline.  Pressure's on.  Oh.  The pressure is on.  Look at the face he made.  Gee, golly.  Gee, for his crime.  I better take out my good stuff for tonight.  The show tonight is at 8 o'clock.  Two shows tomorrow.  Two shows Saturday.  One show Sunday.  Brian Regan at Caroline's.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Brian Regan saying, 
[01:27:30]  and f*** all that PC s***.  This is Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, Diamond Vision, and Dr. Philotoff.  Hey, yes.  I see Brian Regan over there wears glasses, Anthony.  Yeah.  We can take care of that little problem he has over there.  Well, Opie had it done.  And he was a big pussy about it.  He was so scared of this procedure.  And then he sat down with Dr. Philotoff and he talked it out and stuff.  And he went in, had it done.  It was like five minutes that he's in the office.  And now he sees perfect. 
[01:28:00]  2015.  How about that?  In the year 2015, you'll be able to...  What kind of procedure is this?  It's a great procedure, yeah.  He's done over a thousand procedures, Anthony.  He's calling himself the doctor of the stars.  You know, it's weird.  They always say to get somebody who's done like a bunch of procedures,  but somebody has to be the first guy.  The first guy.  Somebody's got to go in there and see the chalkboard with zero under the tally number.  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  When we're done with you, we got the ball rolling.  Then I can tell people I've done one.  Yeah.  Take them down.  How true, man.  Yeah, well, Dr. Philotoff's up to, oh, my God, over a thousand.  Over a thousand.  Opie was one of those.  Yeah.  Do you know what number you are?  No, I don't.  I should find out, huh?  No, huh?  No.  Two.  They say you're going to be within our first one thousand. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, you've got to start somewhere.  You're the second one.  The first one just left the office.  And this guy wasn't even satisfied with Harvard or Yale.  He had to be trained at both.  He went to Harvard and Yale to learn how to do this.  Yeah, I highly recommend this, too.  As much as I'm recommending people see Brian Regan tonight at Carolinas, I recommend this  eye surgery.  Have it done and then go see Brian so you can see him.  Yeah.  Like a two-part date.  Take your date to go get her eyes fixed. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And then take her to the show.  Right.  Why not?  And due to an enormous response from the Valentine's Day promotion, we gave one of our listeners  the gift of sight.  Well, Diamond Vision would like to do that again, Anthony.  He wants everyone to give him a call, and they're going to put you in the running for  a complimentary vision correction and a free exam.  And if you entered the last time we did this, you're going to be automatically entered in  this contest as well, okay?  Win eyesight.  Win eyesight.  Unbelievable.  Isn't that good, Brian?  Sure. 
[01:30:00]  That's quite a prize.  I say Dr. Filatov all the time.  He's better than God.  God effed up on Opie's vision.  Dr. Filatov fixed it.  He fixed it.  Dr. Filatov of Nazareth.  He's the new Messiah.  I'm wearing Nike sneakers now, too.  He's waiting for Dr. Filatov to tell him when the comet is going to come with the spaceship.  Yeah.  How do you beat a gift of, you know, of eyesight?  It ruins every holiday after that, I think.  Yeah.  I mean, you can't say.  What's someone going to give you? 
[01:30:30]  You've got a choice between a $100 gift certificate, free lunch over at Pizza Hut, or what is it?  Oh, eyesight.  You don't have to answer now.  Exactly.  This guy's giving away the gift of sight.  Yeah, screw the concert tickets, you know.  You've done a lot of radio.  Yes.  Have any other jocks given the...  Giving away eyesight?  Accidation, yeah.  Have any other jocks given the gift of sight to their listeners? 
[01:31:00]  I have never heard of an eyesight gift, no.  No, no, no.  Okay.  I've been there where they've given $200 away.  Oh, great.  Yeah, that's almost as good.  In fact, my mom and dad won $200 calling into a...  The radio station called my mom and dad and asked what radio station my mom listened to.  She said, oh, I don't know.  Hang on.  I'm serious.  This is what really happened.  This is what...  You didn't hear this on the air because they edited it all together.  She goes, oh, I don't know.  Hang on. 
[01:31:30]  Walt?  Walt?  This is my dad.  Walt, pick a radio station.  Oh, I don't know, Marie.  Walt!  Walt, pick a radio station.  So down there it was like, why 100 or something like that?  I said, I don't know, why 100?  So she says, why 100?  And they go, you have just won $200, you know?  Which was pretty cool.  My dad worked for Eastern Airlines, so he was allowed to fly for free.  The whole family could fly for free.  There were eight kids, so they said, what are you going to do with the $200?  And my mom said, I'm going to take my eight children to New York City. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, boy.  There you go, Mrs. Regan.  All right, so if you wanted to get the site, you've got to enter this contest.  Call Dr. Phil Toff and Diamond Vision.  1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020.  More with Brian Regan in two minutes.  Stay there.  Opie.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it? 
[01:32:30]  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1027.  WNEW.  We've got to quickly go to the phones here.  Kristen is dying to talk to Brian.  Hi.  Hey, Kristen, you're on the radio with Brian Regan.  Oh, my God, I'm so excited.  I think you're the best ever.  Kristen, thank you so much.  You're welcome.  I love the bit that you do about the cobwebs.  All right.  You're walking out.  She's kind of dumb to do on the radio.  I'm just going to say. 
[01:33:00]  I really like it.  It's a bit to do on the radio, but it's really nice of you to say that you like it.  Thank you.  Oh, look, he's doing it now.  Come on, Brian.  Walk into the wind again for us.  Come on.  I'll just do it, and hopefully people out there can, you know, hopefully they laugh so hard they drive into a bale of hay.  But, you know, it's just when you're walking on the street and, you know, you walk into a spider web, you know, it looks stupid because nobody else sees the web.  They just see you walking off in the distance suddenly flipping out for no reason whatsoever. 
[01:33:30]  You know, you're just walking along.  You're pulling stuff off, yeah.  People going, what happened to him?  That man, his behavior, it's different than what it was.  So we are uncomfortable with that.  I actually did that bit on the CD, which is very hard because the whole joke is completely visual.  Right.  So as I'm doing the CD, I had to try to explain with words, like, things that I would do, you know, like that. 
[01:34:00]  So, you know, you're sitting there flailing and grabbing things up.  I'm going, oh, man, this is way too wordy.  I have another bit, you know, where, like, I have to wave, you know, that the visual in the joke is me waving.  And then as I'm doing it for the CD, I realize nobody can see this.  So I had to say, so you're just kind of, you know, waving uncomfortably there.  I hope this is playing to the listeners. 
[01:34:30]  I just imagine people listening to the CD, what the hell is this guy talking about?  Pulling stuff off his body and awkwardly waving.  I love the thing that you do where it's like, you too.  Yeah, we love the you too.  You too.  We say that all the time.  You must get that all the time, Brian.  No, it's a nice compliment.  Yeah.  Thank you, Kristen.  Thanks, Kristen.  God damn, that's funny.  Thanks, man.  You know, on the CD, they have, you know, you just do an hour and then they just, you know, put it together. 
[01:35:00]  It's seamless when you listen to it.  Sure.  But the producer wanted bit titles.  I guess they can break it up into different bits, even though when you're listening, it doesn't fade out and go into the next joke.  So you needed, like, bit titles.  And there was a deadline for them.  So I was in an airport, like, with a bank of pay phones.  And I had, like, this list of bit titles, you know.  And there was, like, a businessman on my right and, like, this, you know, woman standing on my left. 
[01:35:30]  And I'm on the phone going, um, donut lady.  Then stupid in school.  Then feeling lousy.  I just wonder what this guy's going on.  What is this guy talking about?  Who's he talking to?  Do you still do donut lady in your act?  Sometimes.  I don't usually.  Sometimes I do.  I try to mix it up every show, you know, so it's a little bit different.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  You know.  Because I feel bad for the donut ladies because people can't make up their mind, you know, when you go in there.  I don't know what it is about buying donuts that make people freak out, you know, that they go in there.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  I want a dozen donuts and, uh, you got a lot of donuts.  Okay.  I'm going to start with four chocolate. 
[01:36:30]  I want two twisty goose.  I want a lemon twirler and, no, two lemon twirlers.  I want a honey Bavarian puff.  No.  I want a, I want a, a mifty crunch.  No.  Two.  I want two crunches.  Get, get, get the latter.  I want a Bavarian apple twirl.  Get the latter.  Hey, hey.  Why don't you go out inside and think it over, huh? 
[01:37:00]  It's a big decision.  Hey, can't blow donut day.  But, you know, I, I've come to the realization that, uh, donut ladies know you got to do this  because, uh, sometimes they do the subtraction for you in front of all the other customers  and make you look like a moron, you know.  You go in there.  Um, yeah, I'd like, uh, a dozen donuts.  I'll start with seven chocolate.  You have five left.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  If I order one more, then how many would I have left?  How many would I have then, donut lady?  That's what I need to know in now.  I don't know how she does it.  I don't know how she does it.  I think she's, I think she's palming a clicker.  I think she's cupping something.  She's got a little ball and strike clicker back.  Oh, man, that's mad funny. 
[01:38:00]  Let's go to Matthew.  Matthew, what's going on today?  Hey, not too much.  I just wanted to say, Brian, I really appreciate you hearing her.  And, uh, I wanted to hear Cup of Dirt.  Cup of Dirt.  Cup of Dirt.  Yeah, that's a good bit, too.  Yeah, we used to do that while I was in the Army back and forth.  We'd talk.  It was absolutely good.  Thank you so much, man.  Well, uh, you know, it's, I feel weird that I make a career out of how stupid I am.  But what he's talking about is, uh, science projects, you know, uh, I used to dread waking up the morning the science project was due. 
[01:38:30]  You know, your head would pop off your pillow.  Oh, no.  That's due today.  I had nine months to work on, and I did nothing.  I've got a cardboard box and a marker.  You know, and you'd show up, and all the other kids, you know, their parents made it, made their projects, which I hated.  You know, they're, like, backing them in on flatbed trucks.  You know, the one kid with the volcano. 
[01:39:00]  He didn't know how to zip up his own pants, but he built the volcano.  Wait, wait, how'd you swing that?  And then there was a kid with the, um, the solar system.  You know, a bunch of styrofoam balls held together with coat hangers.  Hey, you're breaking some new ground there, Copernicus.  He's going, the big yellow one's a sun.  The, the yellow one, the, the yellow one is a sun. 
[01:39:30]  The teacher's like, okay, okay, what are these other planets?  The big yellow one, the one in the middle, they refer it, they refer it as the sun.  They say, all right, calm down, calm down.  The one in them, all right.  So I didn't know what to do, you know, I, so I, I, one, one year for my science project,  I just brought in a cup of dirt, you know, hoping she'd know that I was an idiot and just 
[01:40:00]  walk right on past me, you know, as long as I was holding something, you know, so I'm  holding up this cup of dirt, hoping she'd walk by, but she stops right in front of me  and goes, what do you have there, Brian?  It's a cup of dirt.  Just put an F on there and let me go home.  She's like, well, explain it.  Well, it's a cup with dirt in it.  I call it cup of dirt. 
[01:40:30]  You should go ahead and move on now.  You can go ahead and move on down the table now.  Oh, I have to, I have to relive that every night.  Well, you're truly that stupid as a kid.  Come on.  I was, that's pretty funny.  Yeah, that was pretty stupid.  You know, weird, usually you're trying to lie at how smart you were. 
[01:41:00]  I got to like, I can get my transcripts and move on.  I swear.  I was a moron.  I'm a moron.  Nobody believed me.  I'm telling you that God's out in truth.  I was the stupidest kid ever.  Oh, this is great.  Oh, damn.  Tonight at Caroline's.  I'm there.  Yeah, Brian Regan at Caroline's tonight.  Well, we're all going.  Yeah.  We have so many comedians in here.  We never go to their shows.  We're going to yours. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  A lot of them suck.  That's why.  I know.  If we say we're going, that means we like them.  Man, thank you.  It's like when Johnny invites you over to the couch.  We're used to.  He doesn't do that anymore unless you're at his house.  That's a whole different kind of thing.  Come on over here.  Come sit on Johnny.  Good stuff.  There you go.  Yeah, now it's not a couch.  It's just a chair with Johnny in it.  Come on.  Take a seat.  Let's go to Darren.  Hey, Darren, what's going on?  What's going on, guys? 
[01:42:00]  You going to go see Brian Regan this weekend?  I'm trying to on Saturday.  It's my wife and I's anniversary.  We're going to go on this stupid dinner cruise.  But I found out that he's playing at Caroline's.  I call over.  They're all sold out.  I'm telling you, man.  Oh, no.  For all the shows already?  Yeah.  What's that?  And some shows.  We left on Friday night, midnight.  Well, I guess Brian could go home now.  He doesn't have to pull on the show.  Thanks for having me on.  Oh, look at the time.  I've got to go.  Brian, you're awesome.  You're my favorite comedian ever.  Hey, Darren, thank you so much. 
[01:42:30]  And happy anniversary, man.  I hope you can squeeze in somehow.  Darren, hold on.  Thanks.  We're going to find seats for him.  We're going to find seats for you, Darren.  Fantastic.  Not at Caroline's.  Somewhere else.  That's right.  Flash dancers.  Flash dancers.  We'll give him a CD for him to listen to.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah, he's on hold.  Let's go to Billy.  Hey, Billy, what's up?  Yo, what's up over there?  How are you?  Hey, Billy.  How you doing?  How are you?  How Billy's going to say it?  First time caller.  I've never...  I'm a short-time listener. 
[01:43:00]  Short-time listener.  First time caller.  Yeah, I'll just give you guys a chance, man.  You guys are all right.  All right, cool.  All right, Billy.  I'm on the air right now?  Yeah.  That's really cool.  You're talking to Brian Rickon.  It's so funny Saturday night, man.  Whoever's listening, go see it, man.  He's funny.  Yeah.  He's really funny.  He's doing the same stuff, though.  I heard Saturday night, man.  You got anything new?  He's got a lot of new stuff.  Saturday night.  I wasn't here Saturday night.  Where are you talking about?  Dangerfields.  Wasn't this guy Brian did on Dangerfields last Saturday night?  I was there about seven years ago. 
[01:43:30]  For real, I don't know.  I could have sworn I heard that.  Short-time caller.  All right.  I've been in suspended animation for seven years, so it really seems like last Saturday  to me.  If you want to talk to me about that, come in here and sit right behind me, and I'll, you  know, take that guy in a plane.  All right, man.  Well, you know, hopefully you'll come out, and I'll try to do some different stuff from  last Saturday night.  Dangerfield.  Somebody who's at Dangerfield's doing your act, man. 
[01:44:00]  That's what I'm looking at.  Look into this.  Let's go to Steve.  So many people want to say hi to you.  Steve, what's going on, man?  Hey, Brian.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I want to tell you, you did a bit I saw on, like, the comedy channel a while back.  It was, you were doing the school bit, how stupid you were, and so forth.  And the teacher came up to you and was doing the, can you do the plural of this word and  the plural of that word?  And you're going, uh, the geese-ses and geese-ses and so forth.  They love hearing people doing your bits all wrong. 
[01:44:30]  That's very flattering, man.  Hey, Steve, are you a Brian Regan cover band?  No, that's good, man.  I appreciate the fact that you like that.  No, it's excellent, man.  I really do appreciate it.  But, uh, oh, and, hey, listen, uh, I was just down in Florida recently, and you guys  were doing some, uh, Caddyshack bits earlier.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, I actually played on the golf course where they, where they filmed it.  It's called Rolling Hills Country Club.  I played there, too, man.  Yeah, down in 80. 
[01:45:00]  Absolutely hysterical.  You get up to the first day, and you just, like, you start cracking up.  Hey, Whitey.  Where's your hat?  Well, uh, thanks for having me call, guys.  I appreciate talking to you.  Take me to Brian.  I hope to see your show this weekend.  Thank you so much, man.  Bye-bye.  Where is that golf course?  In Florida?  It's, uh, either in Fort Lauderdale or between Miami and Fort Lauderdale.  Somewhere down there.  Mm-hmm.  Bushwood.  No gambling in Bushwood, sir.  Hey, Frank. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  How are you?  Oh, man, I'm, uh, I'm awake now.  You're awake?  Yeah, I was laughing so hard at that cup of dirt, but I got pulled over and I got a ticket  for Estes driving.  You sure you weren't drunk?  Believe me.  I was trying to get him to tune in and listen.  And these guys were, I heard you on the radio as I was talking to him and I was trying  not to crack up in his face and that kind of blew it.  That's when I got the ticket.  He just kind of went back to his clothes and said, stay here.  You got to learn how to control yourself, Frank.  Especially when you got the law on your face. 
[01:46:00]  That's very kind of you.  Thanks.  I used to watch you all time when Comedy Central used to be good and used to do the stand-up,  stand-up.  You used to?  Oh, my God.  Now, you know, you never get any good comedians on there.  It's just one bad movie after another.  Way back when you were on there all the time.  They do play the same old movies over and over again.  Thank you so much, man.  Thank you, Frank.  Where can I find a CD?  You can just go into different music stores or else you can go on the Internet and just... 
[01:46:30]  Do you have a web address I could get it from?  I should have that, but I feel like I'm living in the 1930s.  Frank, I don't have an answering machine either.  Really?  No.  Hey, Frank, I think we put a link up to on our website, you know, where you can find Brian  Reagan's CD.  Oh, that would be awesome.  All right.  Do you have our website address?  What's that?  Yeah, I have your website address.  Okay.  All right.  Put them on hold.  Somebody help this man.  All right, Frank.  Thank you, Frank.  Thanks, Frank.  All right, buddy.  Are you computer savvy? 
[01:47:00]  You know, I have a computer and all that, but I don't, you know.  Some people are funny.  You can tell they just have a website just for money and someone else is running it completely.  Because they come on and try to plug it.  It's like, oh, and I, oh, yeah, the website, the world website, it's w.com.  And then part of my name is in there, but I couldn't get my whole name, so I had to put like  a little initial.  The perfect example is Buddy Ebsen.  And we talked to Buddy Ebsen, because, well, I guess one morning, Howard had on Dana Plato 
[01:47:30]  right before she died, and he got this huge write-up in the paper about how she was the  last interview, and it was on Howard's show.  So we figured we would call Buddy Ebsen every day until he drops dead, so we would get some  press on having the last interview.  And this son of a bitch is still alive.  This is months ago.  We gave up on the vet.  So we were calling him every day, and it was really Buddy Ebsen.  You know, we had his home phone number, and he'd be like, well, doggy.  And we thought we had it, because do we have the original well, doggy, anywhere? 
[01:48:00]  Do we have it on there?  You've got to hear this.  Yeah, this is pretty funny.  We haven't done this in a while.  We thought for sure he was going to go.  All right, so this is well, doggy about five years ago.  No, not even four.  Three years ago.  Three, really?  Yeah, this is Buddy Ebsen, three years ago.  Well, doggy.  Now, that's pretty good.  That was over the phone.  We called him, and he sounded perfectly healthy.  One more time, if we can get the...  Well, doggy. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  All right.  Man.  So now we call him, I guess, a year ago.  Not even.  Not even.  Eight months ago.  And we asked him to do the well, doggy, and here it is.  Well, doggy.  Now, we're seeing a definite dip in the health of Buddy Ebsen.  Oh, so maybe you got the last interview, right?  This is it.  Well, doggy.  Loser don't lose it.  And here's the older one.  Well, doggy.  Well, doggy. 
[01:49:00]  Ouch.  See?  There's a distinct difference.  And he's got a website, but he had no clue what it even was.  Like, the guy's 100 and something years old.  So he's like, W, W, Buddy, come, W, Doggy.  Hey, when people tell you a web address and they don't realize how ridiculously long and  complicated it is, you know, you don't have a pen or a piece of paper and they think you're 
[01:49:30]  going to remember, it's www.egghead-slash-9-7-star-blazer-at-earthlink-com-dot-w-web-net.  Hey.  Little squiggly thing.  I'll check it out, man.  That sounds, that sounds pretty cool.  What was that after the www? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, yeah, you would think they would just be able to make it easier.  Like a phone number, you can reach anyone in the country on the phone, it's how many  goddamn numbers?  I know.  Nine, ten?  What is it?  Three, six, seven, eight, nine, ten numbers?  I'm a moron.  We have five in mind, but everybody has a different kind of phone number.  I've got to climb up the pole.  Sam Drucker here.  I can climb up the telephone pole. 
[01:50:30]  Sarah?  Sarah.  That's all I do.  Sarah, get me www.buddy.net-slash-dot-com.  Comma.  Comma, net.  Dan Jethro's looking at pornography on the www.  Let's go to Mary.  Mary, what's up?  Klondike 56035.  That's Klondike.  Hey, Mary.  How are you doing?  We're talking with Brian Regan, having a lot of fun.  He's at Caroline's all weekend.  I don't even know if there are tickets available, but call Caroline's. 
[01:51:00]  I love Brian Regan.  Thank you, Mary.  The last time you were on, I was at Dairy Barn.  You were where?  Dairy Barn, do you have those?  Dairy Barn?  Oh, did you know Dairy Barn?  Dairy Barn, very big on Long Island.  They have Dairy Barns around New York?  Are you from Long Island, Mary?  This seems like a farm store.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  It's Dairy Barn.  It's a little drive-thru thing where you get milk and eggs and whatnot.  Beer.  They had a drive-thru beer.  And it's got a big silo next to it, like they're working grain. 
[01:51:30]  It's a big barn-looking thing with a silo.  They have a, and I grew up in Miami, Florida.  They had farm stores down there, which is the same kind of thing.  You just pull up and you shout your order to the person, and they've got to scurry around and get it.  Yep.  And they go $3.50 out of $5.00.  And I like it, the Dairy Barn, when you want to buy beer, you have to get out of your car.  For some reason.  Yeah, but I mean, what's the difference if they hand it through the window, or you get out, grab it, and then get back into your car where you can do some safe drinking? 
[01:52:00]  That's some weird law.  Privacy of your front seat.  Yeah, it is.  It's some kind of wacky law.  They can't hand the beer through the window.  All right, you're going to have to get out into the back seat and get out the window on the right side, come out, crawl over the hood, and then you've got to take it one beer at a time.  And you have to drink it under the car.  You have to open each one and take a sip, and then you go back through the back rear window. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, I don't know what that's all about.  So what did you have for Brian today, Mary?  Oh, well, the last time I heard Brian, when he was on a few months ago, I was at Dairy Barn.  I couldn't make my order.  I was laughing so hard.  And it happened again today, and it was stupid in school last time, and I would love to hear Brian do some of that.  You were at Dairy Barn again today?  I got a cupcake.  What a coincidence.  What is up with that?  There's something going on at the Dairy Barn.  It's very convenient.  It's like a magnet to you, Mary.  It is.  Well, I appreciate that you like that.  That guy called earlier about the plurals, and that was another part of it. 
[01:53:00]  He kind of, he tried.  Oh, all right.  But I would much rather you do it.  Well, what it is, it's just, you know, I don't, I didn't know how to make plurals in school.  I mean, I still, I'm still not very good at them.  I just remember sitting there and a teacher going, Brian, Brian, how do you make a word a plural?  Um, well, you say, um, it's a plural now.  No, Brian, Brian, how do you, how do you make a word a plural? 
[01:53:30]  You better be a plural.  Brian, come on.  How do you make, think about it.  How do you make a word a plural?  Or, oh, you put, um, you put a, you put a S at the end of it.  When?  On weekends and holidays.  No, Brian, let me show you.  So she asked this kid, who was in my school, who knew everything. 
[01:54:00]  This kid's name was Irwin.  Irwin, what is the plural for?  Ox.  Oxen.  The farmer used his oxen.  Brian.  What?  Brian, what's the plural for?  Box.  Boxen.  I bought two boxen of donuts.  They had twisty goose.  They had one lemon Twitter, but the honey crunch, they forgot to put the honey crunch. 
[01:54:30]  Brian.  Brian.  Let's, let's try another one.  Irwin, what is the plural for?  Goose.  Geese.  I saw a flock of geese.  Brian.  What?  Brian, what's the plural for moose?  Oh, no.  Moosen.  I saw a flock of moosen.  There are many, many, much moosen.  There are many much moosen in the woods. 
[01:55:00]  In the wood is.  The meese wanting the foods, they're eating it.  The meese were hungries.  The meese wanted to eat in the foods, and the wooden is in.  The one I eat in the food is in the wooden is in.  And the wooden is in.  Brian.  Brian.  Brian.  You're an imbecile.  Imbeciling.  I hope everything's good in the dairy, in the dairy barn. 
[01:55:30]  There you have it, Mary.  She's laughing too hard.  She dropped her phone.  Yeah.  She has to get out of the car to get her beer.  Hey, Ty.  Ty, what's going on today?  Yeah, hey, Brian.  I'm a big fan.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I was just wondering, one of my favorite bits you do is the phone, when people call  you up with the wrong phone numbers.  Right.  I wonder if you can do that.  Well, what's weird is people call you up, and, you know, they ask for a name, you tell  them it's the wrong number, and they don't believe that.  That's what just kills me. 
[01:56:00]  How can they not, why would you make that up, you know?  And so then they have to tell you the telephone number that they're trying to dial, like, they're  like, this isn't 213-3125.  So they don't believe me anyway.  So I just, I go like a million miles an hour.  No.  This is 998-7999.  What the hell's wrong with you?  What are you, drunk?  You're drunk, aren't you? 
[01:56:30]  Okay, I want to try again for, like, an hour.  Oh, man.  I wasn't even close.  Honey, you dial.  I think I had the phone upside down.  There you have it, Ty.  All right, thanks, Skippy McGee.  Skippy.  Oh, okay. 
[01:57:00]  Now I'm having trouble breathing.  What a very funny man.  Thanks, man.  Very funny.  I don't know what you want to do.  I mean, we have to take a break.  You don't have to stay.  If you want, you can.  It's up to you.  Well, I got to get out to the dairy barn.  I got to get some eggs and some milk.  You guys are all right, man.  Cool.  Thank you, Brian.  I appreciate everything.  We're so glad you came back to visit us.  Thank you so much.  It's Brian Regan.  He's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long. 
[01:57:30]  Are there tickets available?  Do we even know?  I would think there might be, you know.  He might be able to shove a few more in the back or something, right?  Give it a try.  God, add some shows, man.  Come on.  Come on.  Strike one.  The iron's not.  I've had places do it, man.  You know.  But that's nice, you know.  It's nice when it goes that route.  You should have seen what Jay Moore did.  You know Jay, right?  Sure.  Live on our show.  The club he was at, I guess, Rascals, was sold out.  Uh-huh.  The club owner calls and goes, oh, we're going to add another couple of shows. 
[01:58:00]  So Jay, live on the air, starts negotiating.  Well, I want 100% of the door now.  Or else we'll tell people that already have seats not to go.  He's got some bargaining power.  He's on the air, you know.  He's got some balls.  By the time he was done, he had like 20 shows booked.  I think he's still there.  Extended stay.  All right.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's all weekend long. 
[01:58:30]  Ant and I and the whole gang, we're going tonight without a doubt.  No one missed this one.  Why don't you call Caroline's and see what shows are available at this time?  212-757-4100.  Okay?  Great.  Brian, thank you so much.  Thank you for having me on, man.  Appreciate it.  Brian Regan.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and I, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Open your yard dance for me.  What a couple of ass wipes. 
[01:59:00]  1-0-2-7.  WNEW.  Hang on.  And we're back, Anthony.  Boy.  Got to thank Brian Regan for stopping by once again.  I'm telling you.  My favorite comedian out there.  Yeah.  Which is surprising because he works clean.  Yeah.  And you'll still laugh your balls off.  Very funny.  I'm hearing there might be some tickets available for the show Saturday.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's. 
[01:59:30]  We're going tonight.  We wouldn't miss this one.  Call Caroline's.  Tickets are going fast.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100, and all right?  Right.  You know, we're doing that Mountain Dew contest, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Got to thank the fine people at Mountain Dew.  They gave us a trip to give away to the Final Four.  I guess it's too late to register.  We were warning and telling you guys that you had to register by noon today.  Well, now the game's underway.  So it would be, you know, stupid if you registered now. 
[02:00:00]  But how are our picks doing?  Anybody playing or done with any games or anything?  Syracuse just won.  That's one of my picks.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, so I wonder if any of my crappy picks, how they're doing.  Well, Anthony, I believe Purdue just won.  Absolutely did.  Purdue.  Purdue.  I told you.  Come on.  Purdue.  Come on.  Still alive.  One step away.  Come on.  Tonight, of course, St. John's plays.  One of my picks.  And Iona tonight. 
[02:00:30]  One of Anthony's picks.  Oh, yeah.  Also, tomorrow.  Tomorrow's the big day for Anthony.  Hofstra.  Hofstra.  Go Hofstra.  Come on.  They've got to be good at basketball.  You ever see the neighborhood of Hofstras?  You ass.  What?  Rick, what's up?  You better be careful with the Hofstra stuff.  Why?  Wayne's calling in a couple minutes.  Oh, that's right.  Wayne Corbett's giving us a call.  Hofstra grad.  Yes.  We'll find out if he's excited about Hofstra being in the tournament. 
[02:01:00]  We'll talk a little football as well with him, all right?  Mm-hmm.  But, yeah, thank you, Mountain Dew, for helping us out, giving us this trip to give away.  And I guess that's all we have to say about Mountain Dew, right?  Yes.  The official soft drink of the NCAA.  AA, you need my credit card?  What?  What are you buying?  Huh?  What are you buying?  I'm staying in tonight.  I'm on a cruise.  Oh.  Credit?  Yeah.  If he was going on a cruise, he would need my credit card. 
[02:01:30]  Ah, shut up.  San is here today.  You can confront her.  No, we've spoke already.  All right.  You said you'd pay me.  I will pay you.  Ah, it's okay.  Just the fact that you said you would is fine.  As eBay closed at 30 points up today, and I punched out at 10.  Ugh.  You would have made a killing today.  Oh, my God.  Dow up 500 points.  499 points today. 
[02:02:00]  Biggest one-point gain.  They must be partying on Wall Street today.  Eh, could all be gone tomorrow.  If stockbroker Dave is in his car right now driving back to Jersey, give us a call.  It must have been a very exciting day on Wall Street.  NASDAQ recovering.  Up 134, I'll be.  134?  Yeah.  Not bad, not bad.  Oh, and let's get the Bobby Knight clip.  We were supposed to play this two hours ago.  Oh, yeah.  Then Brian Regan arrived.  He made us laugh so hard, I forgot all about it.  But this is definitely worth playing.  We've been talking about college basketball. 
[02:02:30]  Everyone excited about the tournament.  Some allegations by some former players saying Bobby Knight choked them and treated them like  crap and all that stuff.  There's some great Bobby Knight websites out there.  One is called The Dark Side of Bobby Knight, and it shows all the mess that is Bobby Knight.  There's a clip of him throwing the chair, the famous chair.  There's audio clips of him yelling and screaming.  Throwing chairs.  There's a list of all the players that couldn't take Bobby Knight's abuse and left the university 
[02:03:00]  for other schools.  And I found the best audio clip, and we've got to play this.  You try to keep track of how many times he uses the F word.  He uses a lot of curses in this one, but the F word is, boy, he likes that one.  Sounds like me trying to record a commercial in the Psycho Marxist studio.  Do we have anything to give away?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get some callers on the line.  212-757-1027.  We'll do a quick contest here.  We'll have how many listeners? 
[02:03:30]  Three?  We'll pick up three listeners, Anthony.  Okay.  And they have to guess how many times Bobby Knight curses during this clip.  Without going over?  Without.  The Price is Right version of the rules?  You want to play Price is Right rules?  Yeah, without going over.  Without going over.  The clip is a minute 15 long.  One minute 15 seconds.  How many times does he use the F word during this clip?  And what do we have for the winners, Rick?  Cool stuff.  We'll just give away some cool, cool stuff? 
[02:04:00]  All right.  I've got to wait for the delay to make sure people know they have to call for the contest.  Doesn't that suck about the delay like that?  We've got to wait.  They're still hearing Brian Regan.  Hey, who's this?  This is Eddie from the Bronx.  I want to get in on this.  All right, Eddie.  All right, hold on the line.  Okay.  Hold on.  I've got to get all my...  Turn your radio down.  Turn your radio down.  Okay.  All right, Eddie's on line 11.  Let's go to line 10.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Hey, Dave. 
[02:04:30]  Turn down your radio.  It's down already.  All right, you're going to play in the contest as well.  I'm going to go right back to you in a second.  Hold on.  I've just got to get to third contestant.  Okay.  And let's go to line 9.  Who's on line 9?  This is Jason.  Hi, Jason.  Where are you calling from?  I'm from River Edge in Jersey.  All right, Jason.  How many times does Bobby Knight curse during this clip?  I'm going to have to guess 17.  17?  17.  All right, and you'll be ringing the bell every time Bobby curses.  Are we going for all curses or just the F word?  Just the F word.  Just the F word?  Well, because there's other curses in there. 
[02:05:00]  All right, can I lower them for a little bit?  Wait, I think you have to go total curses.  Total curses?  Yeah, because there's a few beauties in there.  Let's go total curses.  All right, total.  I'll stick with 17 in total.  All right, 17.  All right, now what, I guess whatever, what a curse is, is whatever's beeped out.  Yeah, because Rick had to beep everything.  All right, hold on the line, man.  All right.  I knew the names.  That's why I kept grabbing this.  All right, Jason.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from my car phone, leaving Hofstra. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, go Hofstra, huh?  Go Dutch.  Go Dutch.  Yeah, who cares?  Let's be honest.  Dave did.  You guys don't have a prayer.  Dave, how many times does Bobby Knight curse during this clip?  You have to guess, obviously.  Well, thanks.  We're still doing this Price is Right rules.  Yeah, you can't go over it?  Yeah, I would think it's kind of silly if you go over.  All right.  So can I be like the fat black chicken and say just $1 one time?  One time?  One curse.  Everyone else is going over, baby.  He's using that technique. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Come on.  That's a smart strategy.  We got an Opie and Anthony prize package up for grabs.  Hold on, Dave, all right?  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, and finally, let's go back to Eddie.  Hey, Eddie?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Bronx.  All right.  Oh, you said that already.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  How many times do you think Bobby Knight curses during this clip?  I say 19.  19?  19.  Wow, I think you guys just gave the thing to Dave.  All right, hold on.  I don't know about that, Opie.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  19 for Eddie.  Okay, hold on the line, Eddie.  All right.  Okay.  There's our contestants.  All right.  Wow, that's some filthy game show music.  That's go crisis, right?  We're going to play guess how many times Bobby Knight curses.  We got Eddie, Dave, and Jason to remind you of the bids.  Jason says he will curse 17 times. 
[02:07:00]  Dave says, Eddie says he will curse 19 times.  And Dave, trying to screw the other two, thinking that they will go over, says he will only curse one time.  One time.  Because we're doing the overrule that they do on the prizes, right?  You can't bid over what the actual retail price is.  All right, Anthony.  With that, let's play the Bobby Knight clip, okay?  All right, someone, we get a few people to keep count on this.  Yeah, because it goes fast.  Here we go.  Bobby Knight, everyone.  I want to play that I'm getting the f*** out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover Greg Graham, if you're just going to let him drive by you, 
[02:07:30]  if the rest of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second lane  and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him,  then I'm leaving and you f***ing guys will run until you can't even suffer.  Now, I'm tired of this s***.  I'm sick and f***ing tired of an eight-and-ten record.  I'm f***ing tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to f*** around this week.  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  Now, I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, 
[02:08:00]  you aren't going to believe the next four f***ing days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday.  Now, you better f***ing understand that right now.  Now, this is absolute f***ing bulls***.  Now, I'll f***ing run your ass right in the ground.  I mean, I'll f***ing run you.  You'll think last night was a f***ing technique.  I had to sit around for a f***ing year with an eight-and-ten record in this f***ing lane.  And I mean, you will not put me in that f***ing position again. 
[02:08:30]  Or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't f***ing believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Wow!  I counted 18.  I won't count.  I counted 18.  We're going to have to do it again.  We have to do it again?  We've got to confirm.  I counted 18.  I wasn't counting.  Which would make Jason...  Only bleeped curses.  Not the where it says ass.  No, it was the bleeped curses.  Only bleeped curses. 
[02:09:00]  I counted 18, which would make Jason the winner.  You want to play it one more time?  One more time.  One more time.  You guys lost count?  Come on, it's easy.  Man, you can't count because you're doing the bell.  I'm ringing the bell, goddammit.  All right.  What is everyone saying on the lines?  18, right?  All right, we'll try it one more time.  One more time.  All right, here we go.  Wow, that would be right in the middle.  Jason said 17.  Eddie said 19.  All right, here we go.  Here's the clip one last time.  Bobby Knight losing it. 
[02:09:30]  What a point that I'm getting the f*** out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover Greg Graham, if you're going to let him drive by you,  if the refs of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second lane  and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him,  then I'm leaving and you f***ing guys will run until you can't even suffer.  Now, I'm tired of this s***.  I'm sick and f***ing tired of an 8-10 record.  I'm f***ing tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to f*** around this week. 
[02:10:00]  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  Now, I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night,  you aren't going to believe in the next four f***ing days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday.  Now, you better f***ing understand that right now.  Now, this is absolute f***ing bulls***.  I'll f***ing run your ass right in the ground.  I mean, I'll f***ing run you.  You'll think last night of a f***ing practice.  I haven't been around for a f***ing year with an 8-10 record in this f***ing lane. 
[02:10:30]  And I mean, you will not put me in that f***ing position again.  Or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't f***ing believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Wow.  That's something.  This just in from Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com.  I think Anthony has found a new commercial reading partner in Bobby Knight.  Hey, hey.  It did sound like me reading the Connecticut School of Rock. 
[02:11:00]  Well, I counted 18 again.  Final total, yeah.  It's definitely 18.  18 curses.  That makes Jason the winner.  He said 17.  Yeah, let's go to Jason.  Jason, congratulations.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Can I just remind the audience to have their pets spayed and neutered while we're at it?  Yeah.  Very good, Jason.  We're going to send you some really good stuff, okay?  All right.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  Let me say sorry to the other guys.  Dave?  Yeah?  We liked your strategy, but it didn't work this time, unfortunately.  Well, I learned something new on the show today.  Yeah, hit it.  Yeah, that's all those hours watching TV, not going to work? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  That sucked, man.  I should have gotten a job instead of watching The Price is Right.  All right.  You tried that strategy, and it backfired on you.  Thank you.  I'm going to call up Bob Barker.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dave.  Let's go to Eddie.  How you doing?  Oh, Eddie, you went the wrong way.  No, I know.  Eddie, you were one off, though.  You said 19 times.  Next time.  This time.  We should give these guys something anyway.  We're going to tie if we didn't have that.  Yeah, let's give them some consolation.  We'll give you fabulous parting gifts.  Yeah, Eddie, hold on.  We have enough crap around here to get out. 
[02:12:00]  A lot of doodles.  And a gift certificate from the Spiegel catalog.  So Greaseman has to give it away.  All right, hold on, Eddie.  Obscure reference of the day right there.  A lot of doodles.  The last thing about Bobby Knight, they had a great little special on CNN last night about him.  Yeah.  There was another incident where he's in the locker room.  I think it was halftime, and he wanted to make his point, so he goes into the bathroom, right?  Yeah.  He wipes his ass.  Did you hear about this?  He wipes his ass like a huge clump of toilet paper. 
[02:12:30]  Not fooling around, just like a nasty wipe, okay?  Comes out with his freaking pants down around his ankles and goes, you guys are playing like this,  and shows his team the crap.  What is wrong with this guy?  While his pants were around his ankles in front of his whole team, man.  All right, Anthony, we've got to say hi to Wayne Corbett.  Wayne's checking in.  Yeah.  Hey, Wayne.  How's it going, man?  Wayne.  Now, how do we know this is the real Wayne Corbett?  I think those days are behind us. 
[02:13:00]  Remember the apostolies now?  Yeah.  We apologize for that still to this day.  How are you, Wayne?  I'm doing pretty good.  I thought your consolation gift for those guys was going to be Jay Moore's copy of Pauly.  They gave me one the other day.  I said, you know, fill it up with a regular premium, and they gave me a copy of Pauly when  I sold it up.  A copy of Pauly.  You know, Wayne, that's a great idea.  I'm going to get some copies of that movie, and we're going to give it to our listeners.  That's fun.  A consolation gift.  Hey, did you just hear that Bobby Knight clip? 
[02:13:30]  I've heard it on the internet.  Yeah, great.  Now, how many times have you been on the receiving end of that?  You know what?  You know him and Coach Parcells are very good friends, so you can imagine they share their  ideas on a pep talk there.  Yeah.  But, you know, I've heard it both ways.  I've listened to it, and I've listened to it right to my face, you know, a couple inches  away.  Really?  Did Parcells ever wipe his ass and say, this is what you guys are playing like?  Oh, God.  Imagine that one.  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:00]  What, like purple bloody things?  So, Wayne, are you excited?  Hopster in the tourney?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's great.  I was at the game when they got the automatic bid, and, you know, it's great for the school.  And Anthony picked them to go all the way, right?  One of my many.  No, Anthony X.  Anthony took Iona to go all the way.  That's even worse.  Isn't that horrible?  But Hopster at one of the, you know, the final four teams picked by Anthony.  Yeah, you know, you could go with the favorites like Opie. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  Or go with the long shots.  You've got to have some fun with it.  Yeah, I mean, what the hell?  You know, we're betting money he owes me, and he's not going to pay me anyway.  Who said that they should be good when you ever look at the neighborhood down there?  Anthony.  Have you ever been down there?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  I know.  Well, it's nice until you go past Hopster, and then it's...  Well, the perimeter isn't bad, and then all of a sudden you get past that, and you're like,  oh, no, I went too far. 
[02:15:00]  It's like some of those base camps they set up in Da Nang, you know?  It's good.  It's okay.  You feel safe.  Just don't get out of the perimeter of the tripwires.  Yeah, and you can't read the signs.  You don't know what direction the store is, so you don't go in, right?  Yeah, when the deli turns into the bodega, you know you're in trouble.  You know, I want to hear a good story.  When I was in school there, I was a younger, sophomore, our star receiver went down there,  got a case of beer, and came out of the beer distributor. 
[02:15:30]  I guess a homeless guy came up to him and said, give me your beer.  The guy had 80 catches in eight games.  The guy was tremendous.  The guy wouldn't give him the case.  He had both arms holding it.  The guy punches him in the face and takes his beer.  Oh, my God.  The guy had to get plastic surgery on his cheekbone.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  I had to play the rest of the season because the swelling couldn't fit a helmet on.  That is great.  I mean, I love Oscar.  What a neighborhood.  It's great.  It's great in Long Island.  But if you go down too far past it, you're in trouble. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Been there.  So, Wayne, everyone's asking about Johnson.  What's the rumor with the trade and all that crap?  Not sure.  I think if they were going to do it, they would have done it already.  That's what I'm thinking.  Are you guys happy with the new coach so far?  I've talked to Al Grill a couple times, and I think he'll be good for us.  He's got a young coach.  This is his first time head coaching in the NFL, so obviously he's going to try his best.  It's good to get some fresh blood in there. 
[02:16:30]  So, who do you think should start this season next year, Lucas or Vinny?  I think Vinny.  I'm starting to like Lucas, though.  I like Lucas a lot.  Yeah.  But, I mean, Vinny, you know, he went to the Pro Bowl.  He led us to the AFC Championship game, so you can't forget that.  No, you've got to give him the first shot, obviously.  Yeah, exactly.  So, have you heard from Jay Moore lately?  You know what?  Since he did his circuit at Rascals in Jersey, he's kind of in hiding, and I'm sure he's 
[02:17:00]  not going to call me after my comments on the beginning of the show.  No, he likes stuff like that.  He hasn't called us in a couple weeks, too.  Really?  I think he's too busy being a Hollywood star.  He's back to being a Hollywood star, yeah.  He's doing that movie.  The film with Pauly 2?  Yeah.  Pauly, Pauly 2.  The bird, yeah, that's right.  The bird didn't die.  You believe I went out and rented that movie?  Pauly, Pauly.  Ouch.  How the hell did you...  The first time I've been on without Jay on at the same time, so I actually got to  talk a little bit.  I know.  Wayne was here when Jay was here, but... 
[02:17:30]  He never said a word.  When Jay is here, it's hard for anyone to get a word in edgewise.  That's for sure.  When Jay's here, we have to break out the Jay Moore sweepers.  It's not the O.P. and Anthony show anymore.  I thought we lost you, Wayne.  Switching phones?  No, I'm still here.  Well, a bunch of people want to talk to you.  Do you want to talk to a few fans or what?  Sure, no problem.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  Can you hold, or do you want us to call you back?  No, hold on, no problem.  All right, hold on, Wayne.  All right.  If you want to talk to Wayne Corbett, we have him for a few minutes.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back. 
[02:18:00]  They're going to call us all up.  You treat them like, you know, good people.  You don't talk down to them.  Hey, f*** you.  Jesus Christ, shut up.  You idiot.  You're such a loser.  Hey, f*** you.  What a retard.  You're high.  Are you stupid?  Hey, f*** you.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  1027-WNEW.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF.  And if you love a good cage match, you're going to love Opie and Anthony on 1027-WNEW. 
[02:18:30]  And Vince, welcome back to the WWF.  We missed you.  The storyline's getting much more interesting now that Vince is back.  All right, we're talking to Wayne Corbett.  Wayne, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Oh, good.  We figured out the phone system.  We didn't hang up on you.  That's good.  All right, a bunch of people want to talk to you.  Let's go right to Steve.  Steve, you're on with Wayne Corbett.  What's going on?  Hey, boys.  How you doing, Wayne?  How's it going, Steve?  Good.  I wonder when you're going to talk to Jets into coming back to New York or come to Long Island 
[02:19:00]  because I hate driving to Jersey to see the Jets play.  The day they moved is the day I stopped being a fan.  But I still go to games, but I root for the other team.  Is that right?  I'm going back to New York.  Wait, you're not a Jets fan just because they play in Jersey?  Yeah.  You're not just there for geographical reasons.  Yes.  That's a little strange.  I'm not happy that they're in Jersey, but...  Right.  You know why?  Because they put New York all over everything.  They sell the T-shirts and sell the hats, but they play in Jersey because the taxes are 
[02:19:30]  better and the money goes to that state instead of our state.  And it's a pain in the ass hitting all the tolls and getting over to Jersey.  I don't know.  I don't agree with it.  I don't blame you, though.  And I went to Nassau, man.  I wouldn't mind, you know, if they had their own stadium in Jersey.  I just hate how they have to cover up all the giant logos and stuff for you guys, Wayne.  Yeah, it looks silly.  They're the only team without their own stadium.  The bastard stepchildren.  I hate that.  Do they cover it up in the locker room, too, or do you have to look at the giant logos and stuff? 
[02:20:00]  No, no.  There's actually five different locker rooms.  Oh, okay.  So we've got our own.  When the Jets are the away team playing the Giants, you've got to switch locker rooms?  No, we have our locker room no matter what.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Take care, boys.  In the case, next Thursday.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next with Wayne Cribbett.  Hey, Wayne.  How's it going?  How you doing?  Just a quick question for you.  Now that Parcells is gone and you've got a first-timer in there, do you feel that you guys are going to have the same fire brought under your asses that, you know, Parcells gave it to you guys? 
[02:20:30]  Absolutely.  Mike's got a good question there, Wayne.  Mike and the Mad Dog got a fan.  We got wings with a banana bone.  And Mike's asking, how's it feel about the Jets Club out there with the Parcells being gone?  Too much, man.  Hey, I think we'll be just fine. 
[02:21:00]  If we had a young team like a couple years ago, I think it might be tough that we might need a coach who's a little more forceful.  Yeah.  But when we, you know, we have an older team.  You've got guys like, you know, Tester Erdine on offense, guys like Brian Cox on defense.  You know, we're pretty much going to right the ship, you know, take care of it.  And we just need someone to pretty much push us in the right direction.  And I think Al's a great guy for that job.  Very good.  You're staying out of the bar fights that way?  Wrong place, wrong time.  That's all taken care of.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff. 
[02:21:30]  Jeff, you're on with Wayne Krabat.  What's up?  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Love your show.  Thanks, Jeff.  I wanted to ask Wayne.  What does he think about Dan Marino retiring and all those great shootouts that the Jets used to have against Miami?  That's a good question.  And I think it's obviously not the best thing for the game.  I know it's the best thing for Dan.  He had a hell of a career.  And, you know, as far as the shootouts we've had in the past, I've played against him ten times over the years.  And every time, even if we were ahead, you know, there was a chance he could bring him back. 
[02:22:00]  There was that kind of excitement he brought to the game.  But, you know, 17 years of playing the league, even though he didn't win the championship, he's still the best quarterback that ever played the game.  And, you know, I'm glad he went out on his terms.  Wayne, I'll give him a lot of credit because he didn't break down and cry at his retirement there, you know.  We have a clip, Wayne, of John Elway snorting when he retired.  This is actually Elway.  He started crying and then he was, like, sucking snot up his nose. 
[02:22:30]  And here it is.  That was really him.  Everybody, you know, everybody handles things differently, you know.  Yeah.  Well, some of these guys, I don't know, they just completely lose him.  So to Ross.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Russ.  Russ, you got a question for Wayne Krabat?  Yeah.  O&A, what's going on?  How are you?  What's up, Russ?  Not much.  Hey, Wayne Krabat.  Yeah.  Hey, it's a pleasure to talk to you.  Listen, I heard a rumor about the teacher in Garfield that you had a lot to do with planning the funeral and helping with so many expenses. 
[02:23:00]  Any truth to that?  Awesome.  I just try to take care of the family.  I wasn't directly involved with paying for the service and stuff.  But I'm trying my best to take care of his widow and his two young sons that are in high school to make sure they, you know, keep their head on straight and almost kind of be a father figure if they need me there for them.  Very good.  All right, let's go to Moose.  Are you philanthropic?  Moose, you're next on WNEW.  Yo, what's up, guys? 
[02:23:30]  How are you?  All right, Wayne, what's up?  How's it going?  Hey, listen, how do you guys feel about Pustos retiring?  Think like he's abandoned a team on you guys or what?  You guys were so close two years ago.  So he came back last year and he kind of left out on you guys.  How do you feel about that?  If we won last year, I think he would have retired last year.  But he's been coaching for a long time.  And, you know, I guess when you just don't feel that you want to do it anymore, like you said, or not 100% in your heart, then, you know, you should leave.  It wouldn't be fair to us if he stayed around, if he didn't completely want to be our coach. 
[02:24:00]  And you want someone who's in there who's, you know, 100% mentally into it.  And that wasn't the case for him, but he had a hell of a coaching career.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm sure he's going to do a hell of a job upstairs for us.  All right.  Thank you, Moose.  Let's go to Ken real fast.  Ken, you're next.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  First of all, Wayne, how's your foot?  You screwed up my fantasy football team last year.  I had a great team until you broke your foot on that line.  Right, right.  And what do you think about the $10 boost in the price in our tickets this year? 
[02:24:30]  What happened with that?  I have no clue, man.  Believe me, we pay for tickets, too, so it's not something we're real happy about, you know.  Are they raising the parking, too?  I don't know.  I don't work there, man.  Raising the parking.  Yeah.  But, Wayne, how's the foot?  The foot is good.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Yeah, the foot is good.  It's not the same.  I don't think it'll ever be the same.  But, you know, I've learned to live with that screw in there, so.  All right.  Tom.  Oh, and hey, what's up? 
[02:25:00]  How much?  We're talking to Wayne Krabat.  Hey, Wayne, how you doing?  How's it going?  Last time you were on, I was at the Dairy Barn, and, no, I'm just kidding.  But yesterday I was at ShopRite, and I saw your cereal box in the store.  Right.  What's up with that?  What's up with that?  I mean, is it going towards charity or making the loot or what?  Making the loot.  It stems from the same thing that Flutie had.  The Flutie Flakes?  The Flutie Flakes had them for his son who's autistic, so they came to me, the same company. 
[02:25:30]  You have it for Jay Moore, right?  You have it.  You have it.  You have a retarded son?  It's for Jay Moore.  Yeah, for Jay.  But I'm for pediatric neurological disorders.  All right.  So the coercion of the benefits go there, so it does real well, and I'm happy I can contribute  to it.  Do you eat the cereal?  I eat the cereal all the time.  Yeah?  I'm single, man.  All I got is Quebec Crunch in my house and TV dinners.  Yeah, I pointed that out to my wife.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Thank you.  Even though I'm an Eagles fan.  Well, I feel sorry for you. 
[02:26:00]  Hang up on him, Eagles fan.  Eagles, please.  So, Wayne, what's your four picks for the NCAA?  Do you follow the college basketball at all?  I follow.  I don't know.  I think it's up in the air.  Obviously, Cincinnati, when they got their best player hurt, you know, that kind of hurt  them, but...  And picked them.  Did he?  See, I know nothing about college football, basketball.  Do you take the color of your uniform?  Do you like the color?  That's what it is, see?  Yeah, Bearcat.  Sounds rough.  They got to win.  Yeah! 
[02:26:30]  I like Temple.  I like Stanford.  I like some of the weirder teams.  Duke, obviously.  Yeah, I got Duke.  But I think it's wide open, which is great.  Great for the fans.  Now, picking Hofstra?  Obviously, that was my fourth pick.  Oh, okay.  I thought that went without saying.  Okay.  I'm picking the Johnnies.  St. John's.  That's a good choice as well.  All right, Wayne.  All right, man.  Well, thanks for checking in.  We appreciate it.  I appreciate you having me.  Keep in touch when the season starts.  I sure will.  And when are you coming in when we have one of those wild shows? 
[02:27:00]  Next time I'm coming by myself.  Yeah, that was pretty funny last time.  All of a sudden, Wayne had to go home.  I didn't understand why.  Hey.  But I appreciate you guys having me.  All right.  It's Wayne Corbett, everyone.  Thanks, Wayne.  Take care, fellas.  All right.  There he goes.  Another friend of the show.  Yes.  All right.  We've got to take another break.  Mm-hmm.  Regroup.  You want me to play one of those?  All right.  Hold on.  And we'll be back.  Okay. 
[02:27:30]  This station would like to remind you not to put off to the model when you can otherwise  catch the worm from a bird's eye.  That's where the very herd.  So just make it north of it.  Happy St. Patrick's time.  Hey, hold me your hands, Anthony.  What the hell?  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man. 
[02:28:00]  What a douche drag.  This is sicker than Faces of Death.  1027 WNEW.  And you want to take a music break or what?  Quick musical break?  Okay.  Two quick songs?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Two quick songs.  We'll be back.  It's 1027 WNEW.  Bogey and Anthony.  I can't do that.  This is debauchery mania.  I can't do that. 
[02:28:30]  Prostate exams for everyone.  I can't do that.  111-1027 WNEW.  Quick musical break there.  That's the CD I'm jamming in the subways these days, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Because you don't want to talk to anyone, so you put your headphones on and you rock.  Yeah.  CD Walkman.  I got the Power Man 5000 in my little unit.  My little Sony CD Discman.  Your little unit?  What?  That's Nobody's Real from the latest CD from Power Man 5000.  Really, really good band. 
[02:29:00]  Really, really good CD.  It's called Tonight the Stars Revolta, Anthony.  Yeah.  And another fave of the show, Alice in Chains before that, Them Bones from Dirt.  We like to take musical breaks every once in a while.  And what are you jamming to?  Very rare these days.  Yeah, very rare.  Unfortunately, because we really do like to rock, you know?  Yeah.  What are you listening to these days?  The new No Doubt?  There you go.  You guys are so...  The new Fiona Apple.  What are you into, man?  How's that working, Ben? 
[02:29:30]  You know what's funny about this whole No Doubt thing?  Yeah.  And he wants tickets to No Doubt.  I need some No Doubt tickets.  I told this to him the other day.  Do you know that his No Doubt tickets are the hardest hits?  Way harder than corn tickets.  Go pick that one up.  Yeah, because I'm going to see corn.  At the Coliseum, right?  You getting me those tickets?  Yeah.  No Doubt is, like, impossible for some reason.  That's right.  Because everybody wants to go.  Everyone wants to hang out with me.  Corn playing April 1st at the Continental Arena.  April 8th at the Nassau Coliseum. 
[02:30:00]  The Allman Brothers are in the middle of their 40-night set.  40 nights.  At the Beacon Theater.  They're just camping out at this point.  I think so.  Gotsmack's coming to town, Ant.  They're going to be part of OzFest this year.  Oh, boy, you think they'll stop in and say hi to Opie and Anthony,  their old pals from Boston?  I think they know.  I think they forgot all about us.  Absolutely not.  Green Day touring this summer with the Warped Tour.  What other new concerts were announced recently?  Methods of Mayhem coming to town April 12th, Irving Plaza. 
[02:30:30]  Rollins Band.  That's always a good time.  April 6th at Irving Plaza.  Dave Matthews Band, July 11th at the stadium.  The Giant Stadium.  Ooh, that's a show I want to see.  Filter, coming to town April 20th at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Danzig, April 28th at the Roxy.  Static X, yeah, they're cool, too.  May 4th at Irving Plaza.  Cool.  Some good shows coming to town finally, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, let's not forget Fish. 
[02:31:00]  Don't laugh.  Fish is good.  Yeah, dude, Fish.  They only play one song per concert, but they're good, man.  May 21st and 22nd, Radio City Music Hall.  That's a weird place to see Fish.  Fish, Radio City Music Hall, everyone's just going to sit in their seats for Fish.  Weed.  Yeah.  I don't think you could really smoke weed in there.  I don't think so.  They're a little strict.  Yeah, where is the No Doubt show?  It's at Roseland to April 6th.  Oh, yeah.  April 6th, Roseland.  No Doubt.  That's right.  It's sold out, too.  You know, that show's sold out.  It's sold out.  It's a good to get. 
[02:31:30]  Trying to see what other shows Ant would like to see on this list.  Ah, you're an idiot.  Come on.  Did you see Willie Nelson's coming back, too?  Yeah, we've got to get him back on our show.  That was a lot of fun.  It doesn't really fit with what we do, but we had a really good time the last time he hung with us.  You can smoke some weed with Mark.  All right.  Now, Anthony likes to rock.  Yeah, you know how it is.  Oh, NSYNC right there.  NSYNC coming to town?  Britney Spears.  Get out of here, Rick. 
[02:32:00]  Go see Lumberboy.  Oh.  For God's sake.  Hey, Ant, you've got to tell your story.  You know, I've got to say, before you start your story, now that I'm taking the LIRR there, I really miss getting pulled over.  Do you?  I just don't get pulled over anymore.  The fun, the excitement.  But I tell you, I've got to admit, because Ant and I, when we used to commute together, we've made up our own rules as far as driving in the city goes. 
[02:32:30]  I think you're allowed a certain amount of, you know, driving on the sidewalk, backing up the one-way streets.  You're allowed that if you do it on a daily basis.  If you're just a tourist driving around up here, you pay attention to the rules.  If you do it day in, day out, you make your own way.  But, yeah, I made my own way today.  I made a right turn from, I guess, what is that, 72nd, 73rd, somewhere up there on Broadway, onto Broadway.  Not allowed to do it.  Signs all over.  Buses only to make right turns. 
[02:33:00]  It's kind of a median thing in pedestrians.  It's a real pain in the ass, but I make it all the time, every day.  I'm there.  Make that turn.  A guy directing traffic today.  One of those traffic cops.  Not a real cop.  He's one of the traffic guys.  And sees me do it.  I try to do it behind a bus so he doesn't see me.  But I'm going to do it anyway.  And then I stop right on the corner where I stop every day.  And cop comes walking over.  Cop comes walking right over to me. 
[02:33:30]  I see him in the rearview mirror.  I go, oh, boy, here he comes.  Here comes Barney Fife.  I roll the window down.  License and registration, please.  I'm like, oh, this is going to be great already.  I hear the accent.  And so, Opie, I still have my Massachusetts license and registrates.  How long have we been here?  We've been here almost two years.  That's right, Opie.  And I'm waiting for it to expire.  So I give it to him.  And the Reggie from Massachusetts, in case you don't know, has the insurance thing stamped on it. 
[02:34:00]  It's not a separate card.  In New York, you have your Reggie and your insurance card.  In Massachusetts, it's a big card.  That's your registration.  And in the insurance spot, it's stamped by your insurance company.  That's it.  So he goes, insurance card, please.  I go, no, it's Massachusetts.  They just stamp it.  No.  You have no insurance.  I go, right here, see?  It says Aetna, whatever, insurance company right here in Massachusetts.  And I'm explaining to him.  They stamp it. 
[02:34:30]  They validate your insurance on your Reggie.  No, you do not have insurance card.  So at this point, I'm just looking at him.  I go, look, call a real cop.  I go, right now, call a real cop.  He'll tell you.  I've been pulled over before.  And I'm hoping a real cop shows up because we know him.  We know the cop.  I'll talk and go, hey, what's up?  What's up?  How you doing, man?  It's me again.  I got pulled over.  How you doing?  You believe this guy?  He doesn't even know this is an insurance thing.  What do you want me to do?  He faxed the ticket to the precinct and you guys will take care of it? 
[02:35:00]  Okay, I'll do that when I get to work.  Because now, let me tell you something.  Now I'm starting to get a little bit of an attitude.  I've got to be honest with you.  I never thought that would happen.  Especially with the traffic people.  You having an attitude, Anthony?  I'm usually very nice and courteous, which I still am.  I wasn't insulting him or anything.  But I find I will speak my mind a little more where I wanted a real New York City police officer there to tell this clown.  That, uh, how is the guy pulling me, not even pulling me over, because he didn't pull me over. 
[02:35:30]  He's direct in traffic.  He leaves his post to come walk a half a block over to me because I made an illegal turn.  And how does he know, not know, about the registration and insurance thing on a Massachusetts Reggie?  He shouldn't even be questioning it unless he knows it.  So he was talking out of his ass.  I said, get a real cop here.  Now.  So what happened?  I, I, he didn't call my bluff or something.  He didn't do it. 
[02:36:00]  He handed me back my stuff and said, you made an illegal turn over there.  I said, ah, you know, there was a bus in front of me.  I didn't even see the sign.  I go, where was the sign?  I was just following the bus.  I'm from out of town.  That's the best way to have in those plates.  Because that worked to my advantage a couple times.  Yeah.  But then you can't pull the, uh.  You guys don't even understand how many times we've been pulled over.  I get pulled over so much.  It's just retarded.  Well, I guess I'm really doing, I, I, I drive like a maniac. 
[02:36:30]  West Side Highway, it's one lane.  Oh, they paint some dotted lines on there.  And while they're doing construction, the thing is like an anaconda now, the way it just zigs and zags.  In and out.  In and out.  And they try to keep three lanes painted on it.  I don't pay attention.  It's like, it's like the Laguna Seca circuit for me at this point.  I'm cutting apexes.  I'm doing like 80.  I don't care what's in my way.  No blinker.  Blinker.  Well, why use a blinker?  It's one lane. 
[02:37:00]  I'm not turning off of it.  There's big retaining wall.  All of a sudden, you do an 80, and you'll come up on a big wall that wasn't there last night.  That's now turning you 90 degrees to the right.  Whoa.  What?  You stomp on the brakes, cut some people off.  But that's how I, I, I've, I've totally gotten into the New York driving thing.  After two years of driving consistently every day, you sort of get into the habit of things.  You do things right in front of cops that you would never have done years ago. 
[02:37:30]  Well, like, you don't use blinkers when you're driving down Broadway, changing lanes.  There's cabbies, truck, I don't got time for the blinkers.  Zigging and zagging.  Right.  I have a driving philosophy.  As long as I, I've been pulled over less than four times a year, I'm happy.  I don't care about the pulled over.  I like meeting the people.  It's fun.  I just, I, as long as I drive away without a ticket, I'm fine.  Fine and dandy by me.  I got my little press identification hanging from the rear view mirror now.  Sort of strategically turn it towards the window when they come up.  Hello. 
[02:38:00]  We found that works quite nicely at press conferences.  Oh, yeah.  They'll throw you right out.  It's fantastic.  Paul, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  We're doing all right, man.  I have to know, it's the New York State law that traffic cops cannot pull anybody over.  Yeah.  Their job is direct traffic and to write parking tickets.  Parking tickets.  Parking tickets.  That's it.  Yeah, the guy asked me for my license in Reggie, and he had no clue what the registration was  that the insurance thing was on there.  I was laughing at him.  I go, get a real cop.  And he was definitely a traffic cop. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  He had the cute little vest on and everything, and he spoke another language.  He had the little gloves on, and he left his post.  He left his post.  He's direct in traffic.  I made the turn.  He looked at me, and he starts walking towards the truck.  And I'm just laughing.  I go, here he comes.  I got to talk to him.  You could have just drove away.  No, I had to talk to this guy.  That would have been more fun.  You just lead him on a few blocks.  Oh, slowly start creeping?  Yeah.  That would have been pretty funny.  Until he's like five blocks away from his post. 
[02:39:00]  What happened?  Good am I?  You guys are the best.  Hey, thank you, Paul.  10-10 on the side, Diamond Duck.  All right now.  Thank you very much.  He's 10-10 on the side, hoping.  We're one day away from vacation.  Yeah.  You can feel it in the air.  Getting out of here for a week.  Tomorrow's the big day.  We're just going to leave the show at 545.  A new tradition we started.  Yeah.  About three, four months ago, before holidays and vacations.  We did the last hour of the show at a bar close to the studio.  Yeah.  And we'll announce that bar during the show tomorrow. 
[02:39:30]  But if you really want to join us, just be in the vicinity of the radio station.  Do it in the area, because it's only a few blocks.  A couple blocks.  That's it.  Don't expect much.  It's not like a road show.  I mean, if some of our freaks show up and they want to perform, that's great.  But we're pretty much just going there to drink some green beer with you guys, throw  out some shirts, say, hey, thanks for listening for the last three, four months.  And a little bit of fun.  And then we'll take a break and we'll be back.  Yeah.  All right.  And let's take a break here.  All right.  Yeah, that was fun. 
[02:40:00]  Like I said, I don't mind getting pulled over or anything, but it's the tickets I don't  like.  And you are missing out on something taking the train.  Yeah, because the train is just a bore fest, man.  Yeah.  Same people in the same seats doing the same annoying things.  Can't get away from it.  There's the loud ladies from Dix Hills going in for the matinee.  You don't get the satisfaction of good moves.  No.  You got the cell phone guy making the same exact, you know, calls every day. 
[02:40:30]  Then you got the sick person every day.  They've had a cold for two years.  Remember how happy you used to be?  Oh, dude, you got to give it to me.  That was move of the day.  Move of the day.  Like you'd cut off a whole friggin' line of traffic.  We used to have all sorts of awards we gave out to each other.  Move of the day was a key one.  That's move of the day.  Flip off of the day.  Yeah.  Cursing.  Yeah, you remember road rage we used to get.  We would rag people and, like, get really pissed. 
[02:41:00]  We would throw soda at other cars.  Remember driving with me to Rick's bachelor party?  Anthony on the sidewalk, backward, wrong way on one-way streets.  I don't care.  I'm getting from point A to point B as quickly as possible.  I must say, we do bow to you because forgoing the laws.  You have pulled some moves that are just absolutely amazing.  You know Queens Plaza?  Anthony drives up on the sidewalk.  Yeah, on the cement, on the sidewalk, in between.  I'm doing, like, a slalom on the L.  He's been known to drive on the sidewalk to get around cars. 
[02:41:30]  It's the best way because not many cars are up there.  It's a classic move.  Instead of seeing the excitement that is, Anthony's driving now I hear,  next stop, Minneola, Minneola, next stop, Minneola.  What train are you on where it sounds like that?  Here's a...  Oh, man, you're dating yourself.  They have fixed the sound system on the train.  Oh, really?  The best is if you get to take the double-decker for two stops 
[02:42:00]  because they effed that whole thing up, the double-deckers.  Yeah.  They can't make it into the city, so, what, they go two stops on the Long Island Railroad?  What did they do?  They screw it?  What, did they make it bigger than the tunnels?  I think that's what the deal is, right?  Actually, we were making trains, and they were supposed to be really big.  I took one in the other day and I actually made it in.  They made it in?  What, did they shave off the top finally?  I think they lowered the pressure on the tires.  They lowered the pressure on the tires. 
[02:42:30]  But they have the computer voices on the double-deckers now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like Cylons?  Yeah.  By your command.  Right, right.  Minneola, next stop.  So, yeah, it's a bore fest, man, the train.  Yeah.  I like the action of driving.  I do get agitated sometimes, but sometimes it's a lot of fun.  Sometimes.  Remember that.  A what?  Road racing.  Which one is this?  It's not on there.  You want me to just play that as we go to break? 
[02:43:00]  All right.  What is this?  This is road racing.  Oh, actual audio of Anthony driving?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, this is great.  We haven't played this in a while.  We used to tape ourselves coming into work.  Yeah.  And we would make all stupid comments and stuff at people, and we'd have to pass the jail  and see everyone visiting daddy and stuff.  Queensborough Correctional Facility.  Yeah.  So when you're trying to rekindle how awesome it was to drive in, listen to this tape, and  then remember how stressed out you guys were for, like, the first hour of the show.  Yeah, because I think Anthony lost a few years of his life by driving. 
[02:43:30]  I think so.  Well, you know what it is.  Driving in from Brooklyn is a hell of a lot better than driving in from Long Island.  I will tell you that.  It takes half the time, and it's not as much aggravation.  Once you get away from the Jews in Brooklyn, because I've got to tell you, another blanket  statement, and I'm talking the Hasidic Jews from Brooklyn, right there on Ocean Parkway.  Holy mother of pearl.  I swear to God, two miles an hour. 
[02:44:00]  Like, get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  No.  Three lanes across, station wagons, big hats.  And curls.  And a payus.  All right.  Well, this is Anthony losing it.  This is actual audio of us commuting.  This is about a year ago.  When was the last time we drove together?  Trying to figure it out.  A while ago.  Okay.  And why don't we drive anymore together?  Because you live very far away from me now.  And how did that happen? 
[02:44:30]  Well, it all started.  Speaking of right now.  Okay.  Now, let's play this.  Cute little story.  Let's play this.  We'll take a break, and we'll be back.  I've got all the kids going to see Daddy.  Come on.  Oh, some woman has no teeth.  No teeth.  Sweetie, you need a burger.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Oh.  That guy's got to be guilty of something. 
[02:45:00]  What up, G?  What up?  Never seen one with blonde hair.  Oh, look at this.  That's the same f**k that would be honking if you were in his way.  In a green light.  Look at these d**holes.  Look at this guy.  Hit him.  Oh, my God.  I'd ram right into the side of him.  Would have made that light.  Billie Jean King called.  She wants her hairstyle back.  My lane here.  My lane. 
[02:45:30]  A**hole.  Now you don't get in.  F**k you.  Hey, Fabio.  See that guy?  I cannot believe it's not about the wall.  Look it up there.  Where?  Coming out from behind there.  That's a dude.  Oh, shut up.  That guy's got the biggest s**ts I've ever seen.  Yay.  No.  No.  Just go.  I'll let you go.  You can go anywhere. 
[02:46:00]  Wax on.  Wax off.  Oh, why are we stopping?  Come on.  Look at this f**k.  Oh, come on.  Maybe they drive like that in Bangladesh, not here.  Take off your top.  Yeah, you eat that ice cream.  Out of the way.  Coming through.  Oh, no.  My lane.  My lane.  That's the way.  Ah, you f**king a**hole.  I was wrong.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:46:30]  I'll get you, my pity.  And your little dog, too.  What's he looking at?  Hey, everyone.  It's Arsenio Hall.  It's Gary Coleman.  Watch out.  I'll punch you in the knee.  Oh, look here.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Look at the big things.  Socks full of sand. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, just keep going through red lights.  Keep going.  Pick away.  Hit me off so you can just stop.  You f**king d**k.  Pick away.  Oh, my God.  Hey, look.  It's the frugal gourmet.  Hey, must any boys lay lay?  Hey, frugal gourmet.  I think that actually was him.  It looked like that.  That's it.  Just walk in the road.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  Look at the fossil getting out of this car.  Jesus.  Oh.  Life.  Come on. 
[02:47:30]  Come on.  Just go.  No one in front of you.  What a f**k.  You can't pick up up there in the middle of the road, you f**king a**hole.  Holy s**t.  He's stopping in the left turn lane.  Oh, my God.  It's Link from the Mod Squad.  Where?  Look at that dew.  We're almost there.  Make this light.  Make this light.  Come on.  We're one block away.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Coming through.  Coming through.  Oh. 
[02:48:00]  Hey.  Oh.  Hey, now.  Coming through.  Yeah, we made it.  It's the sanctuary.  Opie and Anthony, in my day, radio was boring all the time, and we liked it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  What do you got, man?  Yeah, I got what I learned on the show today.  Oh, an early one.  Yeah, what did you learn?  I learned that John Rocker must carpool with Opie and Anthony. 
[02:48:30]  Come on.  Why?  What?  Like, you guys haven't said stuff like that when you're driving in.  Oh, I'd say it, but the only one hears it is me, in the car.  Instead of two million people?  Yeah, I punch the windows, I yell, and I scream at people, but no one hears it.  Yeah.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  You guys rule.  Syndicate now.  All right.  We appreciate that.  Thank you.  I like keeping some loose change right there in the cup holder, so if somebody really pisses  me off, you roll the window down, and you can do the side on, whoosh, with  a penny, ping, it hits the window, and you just stare straight ahead and look like, oh, 
[02:49:00]  man, what, what?  I used to have golf balls in the wind glove box.  When we golf, sometimes there's a couple of golf balls in there, and boy, those will  bounce real good.  Hey, Karen, what's going on?  Nothing.  I'm just listening to you two reminisce about how you used to drive in together, and you  were reminding me a little bit of the ambiguously gay dillow.  Easy.  What?  I'm sorry.  I just had to say it.  Easy.  I was almost here listening to the two of you.  Hey, because your car pulled together?  Your home all?  Yeah, Jay Moore.  No, no, no.  Just how much you missed it. 
[02:49:30]  A tear in my eye.  Hey, Jay Moore's gone.  We got this show right back to where it should be, that heterosexual radio at its best.  Karen.  Speaking of Jay Moore, when are you going to play What's in My Pants again?  When he calls.  We play from time to time, but that's the game we like to play when Jay calls us.  Karen.  I'm dying to play.  I know you're going to get it wrong.  Karen.  Oh, you want to play right now?  You'd have to give me two minutes so I can get off on the next rest stop.  I'm on the turnpike.  All right.  We're in the middle of commercials anyway.  Hold on.  Okay.  Well, I would like to ask you something.  Sure.  What did we ever say we missed driving with each other or missed the drive? 
[02:50:00]  Okay, you got me there.  Thank you.  You got me there.  You guys are great.  I don't miss driving with Anthony because I see him every damn day.  I don't miss, you know, I'm sure he doesn't miss me bitching and complaining about the  drive-in.  Celine video today was great.  And I don't miss him coming into my truck with some kind of fish and vinegar concoction  that he's eating.  And what did you miss him coming into?  Well, with the best, it just got his truck when we were commuting together and he would 
[02:50:30]  show up at my house and I would have like a seven-course meal that I would just plop down  all over his car.  Vicariously teetering on his kneecap, on the dash, on the seat.  And I'm looking like, son of a bitch, man.  I try to keep the truck nice.  And this, like, protein alfalfa shake.  Thank you so much again.  Protein alfalfa shake is ready to go all over it.  All over my car.  Well, we had a commute during the lunch hour, so I had to eat in your car.  It would freak him out, man.  All right, Karen, we're going to play What's in Your Pants right after commercial, so stay 
[02:51:00]  there.  I'm actually in the rest stop now.  All right.  Hold on.  Take your pants down and...  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Ah, yes.  Joey was here yesterday, and I actually got to get one bite of the fried ravioli I loved  so much before it was ravaged like Lord of the Flies.  Rick and Psycho Mark came in and took all of my fried raviolis.  The only thing I can say is I totally don't have...  I can't totally blame you, because they are great. 
[02:51:30]  I suggest you get that as your appetizer when you go to Paisano.  We love it.  Down there all the time.  When was the last time you were down there?  I think Rick was there last night.  Oh, Rick, you were down there last night?  Rick, did you have a success story last night with Paisano?  We got the...  You know how they like to bring out the huge plate of appetizer?  Yeah.  The hot anti-pasta, whatever the hell they call it.  Just two of those.  Two?  Wheeled them out.  Two?  Ponderous. 
[02:52:00]  Ponderous.  F-ing ponderous.  Yeah.  And then...  How many people did you have there?  There's only six.  Two?  Two.  This thing is huge.  One guy was like 6'4", 250, so he ate a lot.  There you go.  And, yeah, food was awesome.  Cool.  Yeah, and Joey's back.  He had a daughter recently, or his wife had the daughter, and he just kind of watched and  told her to push real hard.  But Joey took some time off, and now he's back at the restaurant on a daily basis.  And if you ask for Joey when you go down there, he will give you a glass of wine on the house. 
[02:52:30]  Right, Anthony?  Right.  We love the place.  We're there all the time.  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give them a call.  965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So here's just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1027-70-NEW.  All right, let's get back to Karen.  Karen, you found the rest stop, right?  Yes, I did.  Okay, and you want to play a quick round of What's in My Pants? 
[02:53:00]  You're convinced that we're not going to get it, right?  We're convinced.  Okay.  Okay.  Um, you take your pants down?  Yes, I did.  What were you wearing?  I was wearing pants.  What, jeans or something?  No, work pants, trousers for work.  Trousers, okay.  What kind of panties?  Uh, your basic black bikini panties.  Okay, and what nationality are you?  Irish and French.  Irish and French.  Well, Italian by injection now.  All right.  Okay.  French have some, they have some bad hygiene, so I'm going to take that into consideration. 
[02:53:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Uh, any, uh, questions you want to ask before she plays the game?  Um, a little quick little what you look like kind of thing.  Um, 5'5", blonde hair, blue eyes.  Blonde hair, okay.  Blonde hair.  Natural blonde?  No.  Okay.  Well, yes, originally naturally, but then dyed it about a zillion times.  Okay.  How old are you?  Uh, 33.  All right.  Do you have darker roots than Kunta Kinte? 
[02:54:00]  No.  No roots.  All right.  I love that line.  Uh, okay.  Well, um, yeah, that's about it.  I guess it's just time to, to give a listen.  Yeah, let's see.  Are you ready?  All right.  First, remember, up and down a couple of times so we can, uh, get a good, good sound.  You got it.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Karen's playing What's in My Pants.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  That's telling.  You hear that?  Yeah.  Telling.  Okay.  Was that up and down?  That was up and down.  All right.  Now the side to side.  This is the very important one.  Hold on.  Got that?  That's telling.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I'm not sure if that's hair that we're here.  I know.  I know.  Um, I'll start it.  Wait, wait.  Circular.  Do a little circular motion. 
[02:55:00]  Circular motion.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  Now you're making it harder.  No.  Okay, that was circular.  Okay.  Yeah, I got it.  I think I do, too.  Who wants to start?  I'll start.  All right.  I'm going to go with a fine-groomed natural triangle.  Okay.  I hope he's going with the fine-groomed natural triangle.  Psycho Mark, would you like that?  I'm going to go with, your paperwork is not in order, Hitler mustache.  Hitler mustache.  I'm going to go with a mohawk.  Mohawk, Rick.  And I, too, am going to go with the mohawk. 
[02:55:30]  I think that's what I heard.  Ready?  Yes.  Karen?  Yes.  What's in your pants?  Absolutely nothing.  Oh!  Holy Karen, she beat us.  That was the Flintstone pants.  I knew you wouldn't get that.  You know, I was going to say that, but then.  Nothing is the hardest thing.  You threw off on that French hygiene thing.  Well, nothing is the hardest thing because it can make a sound like something.  Because it could be stubble.  What was that we were hearing?  What was that flapping we were hearing on the side-to-side? 
[02:56:00]  Flapping?  I didn't hear flapping.  There's no flapping.  It doesn't look like the horse mouth, does it?  The horse mouth, no.  When you give a horse an apple and its lips go...  I haven't given a horse an apple lately.  So now what do I win?  We got to give you something for that.  You stumped us.  Karen beat us in What's in My Pants.  Beat everybody.  We'll give you some good stuff.  Do you want to stay on hold?  Sure. 
[02:56:30]  Virgin.  All right.  Well, Karen, thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  Thanks.  You guys are great.  All right.  Wood floor for Karen.  Never would have guessed that.  All right.  Hold on.  Line two gets some prizes there.  And I guess we can play a round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  Sure.  All right.  Sure.  Let's start with Andrew on line eight.  Hey, Andrew.  Yeah.  Welcome to the radio show.  How are you?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  All right.  What did you learn on the show?  I learned today that the big yellow one in the middle is the sun.

Brian Regan at Caroline's, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're all going tonight.  We'll see you guys there.  I'm hearing there's a few tickets left.  Very, very funny guy.  One of the funniest, if not the funniest guy I've ever seen live, Anthony.  Yes.  Call Caroline's for ticket reservations.  212-757-4100. 
[02:57:30]  Let's go to Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Anthony's like me has a head full of cosmic debris with the movie references.  So what I got to know from the first Dirty Harry movie.  I got to know.  I got to.  You did it in the first hour when I was coming home.  Yes.  I gots to know.  And yesterday, I picked up the one from Caddyshack.  That's going to do us good now.  That retard you have answering the phone didn't let me through at 620.  So.  Yeah.  I gots to know whether there was a.

Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Andre.  Andre, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Bob Knight likes to whip out his nugget to his players.  Well, he likes to wipe the nuggets and then show it to the team to show them how bad they're  playing.  Yeah, with the hands of his ankles.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye. 
[02:58:30]  Let's go to Jason.  Hey, Jason.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  Line three.  People are getting really pissed at this tapping.  Yeah.  Guys, it's killing me.  All right, Jason.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Anthony and Bobby Knight will be getting together for the next Mountain Dew  Read.  Well, that's good.  I got a question for you guys.  We might have to end with that.  Where is that damn thing?  We'll play it one more time.  The outtakes from the Mountain Dew Read that got Anthony just so livid.  What, what, Jason?  Did you guys forget about the Siamese Spaz and Stinky? 
[02:59:00]  No, not yet.  Siamese Spaz and Stinky.  Conjoined Spazes.  Yes.  We're doing conjoined Spazes, and we'll put it on the webcam.  We'll do it on the webcam and stuff soon.  The Spaz went on vacation, so we'll have to do it in like a week or so.  Oh, he walked out of the show again?  Yeah, he did.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Buttnut from Joy-Z.  What I learned today, I need to install live cams at the rest stops along the Jersey  turnpike.  Yeah.  Well, there's not many good ones here today. 
[02:59:30]  Let's try Matt.  Hey, Matt, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  How are you?  All right.  I learned that you guys should do your show from the car.  That was funny, huh?  That was hilarious.  Yeah.  I was laughing my ass off.  Well, you shan't ever be hearing us driving in together again.  Yeah, right?  Unless Opie moves to Brooklyn.  Yeah, we should drive in just for the hell of it.  We have so much tape for that.  We'll have to cut up some more of that.  Oh, that was great.  I'd love to hear it.  All right.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Syndication now.  All right, cool.  All right.  Later.  All right.  Wasn't that actually the mellow stuff? 
[03:00:00]  Because that was kind of at the beginning of when we were here.  So we were like, I think we edited out a couple of things.  We edited out a lot of the raunchy, nasty stuff.  Yes.  We've got that now.  Anything goes now.  We don't care about what anyone thinks anymore.  And I'm stalling.  I'm hoping to get a few more people on the radio, but not liking what we got on the screen  here.  Nothing obscure.  Let's go to Josh.  Josh, what did you learn on the show today?  Yaddle doodle.  I learned that Greaseman used to give away Spiegel gift certificates.  That's good. 
[03:00:30]  Yaddle doodle.  You like that?  And the winner will receive a gift certificate from the Spiegel catalog.  Bone dry.  Yaddle doodle.  Syndication now.  Thank you, Josh.  Bye.  Bye.  Tomorrow, the last day before we go on vacation, don't forget, around 545, we're going  to finish the show at one of the bars right around the station.  Yes.  And we'll announce that tomorrow around 430 or so.  We'll be back with more of the Greaseman show after these words.  Let's go to John. 
[03:01:00]  Hey, John, what's up?  Yeah, I learned that ordering donuts is the hardest thing anyone will ever do.  That is true.  I can't wait to see him tonight.  Yeah, we're very excited to see Brian tonight.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Syndication year 2015.  All right, guys.  2015.  That's how long it's going to take unless we figure out that we need to behave.  See, I miss spats because whoever's answering the phones is doing a horrible job.  Look how slow they are.  Even a monkey, if you're getting the same job every day, will kind of get good at it. 
[03:01:30]  All right, let's go to Bill.  This is taking way too slow.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, I learned what roast beef sounds like on the radio today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, with that girl in the car.  All right, thank you, Bill.  What are you feeding the Mountain Dew Cliffs?  What, the other one? 
[03:02:00]  The Connecticut?  All right, well, should we end with the Connecticut School of Broadcasting thing?  We're doing both.  We're doing both?  Well, let's play the first one then.  Yeah.  Because the calls, I mean, no one's screening them, basically.  Great.  I love being the brunt of the joke at the end of the show.  Ah, Fuel, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Not much.  Hey.  I learned something today.  Yeah.  I learned that your vacation started about 4 o'clock this afternoon.  Go smudge, boys.  All right. 
[03:02:30]  Now, come on.  Brian Regan was funny.  Yeah, he's doing all the work today.  He was great.  Yeah.  And the Bobby Knight clip was good, and Wayne Corbett was okay.  Again, all of everybody else doing all the work.  Right.  Yeah, we're, our brains are somewhere else.  You know how it is when you know vacation's coming?  Oh, yeah, you coast.  Yeah.  You coast, and you can't wait, and that's all you can think of?  Absolutely.  You've taken your midterms, and you're just waiting for the end of the week?  Yeah.  How do you know about midterms?  I have no clue.  Those are the things I took vacation before. 
[03:03:00]  You know, I was supposed to take them, but I never showed up for those things.  Did you guys get the new songs I sent in?  Did we get the new songs by Fuel?  We got a bunch of songs.  We got a bunch of songs.  We got to play some of those before we go on vacation.  We're still doing the most offensive song contest.  Fuel, one of the guys that is in the lead with the Baby Raper song.  They're pretty cool.  Do you like your new ones?  The new ones are good.  I don't know if they're as offensive as Baby Raper, but they're more specifically offensive  to certain groups.  Oh, okay.  Could you say the titles of the new songs you sent in?  Yes. 
[03:03:30]  One is called Camp Concentration.  Oh, my God.  Well, wait a minute.  That could be very offensive.  It's sung like a campfire song.  It's cute.  Okay.  All right.  And the other one is called My Retarded Son.  All right.  I can't wait to hear these.  We'll put them on the radio tomorrow, Fuel.  Cool.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Camp Concentration.  He's really hedging his bets here by sending in a lot of entries.  Well, Ant.  Hey, and speaking of my high school career.  Well, are we going to get in touch with John Glenn and have them give me a goddamn, like, 
[03:04:00]  what do they call that, honorary high school diploma?  Yeah, we should do that.  I mean, for the love of God, it was just gym class I missed.  Come on.  I'll climb a rope.  I'll do some push-ups.  You give me my goddamn diploma.  All right.  We have the bloopers, but we've got to step aside for Donna, Mike.  Yes.  We got in a little trouble going late the other day, so.  Oops.  You sure?  All right.  Which one do you want to play?  Which one do you think is fine? 
[03:04:30]  You want to play the Connecticut School of Broadcasting when Ant really loses it.  All right.  Go with Connecticut.  Why are you laughing?  I'm just laughing because I know how much it sounds like Bobby Knight.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  Dance impression of Bobby Knight.  Ant and I, you know, from time to time we have to read commercials, and we're really  not that good at them.  Yeah.  I mean, we're better when, like, it's live radio and the client is counting on us, and  then we pop something out of our butts.  Right.  But sometimes we have to pre-record them. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  And it just never works out right when we're in a studio like that.  Mm-hmm.  And so we got the outtakes of the Connecticut School of Broadcasting read we had to do about  a month ago.  You know, it was a little longer than a month ago, and to my credit, this might have been  the day that I found out my bank account was a couple of numbers short.  Okay?  It starts out where we can't even say our name's right.  This is so pathetic. 
[03:05:30]  Professional broadcasting.  Yes.  At its best.  We'll see you guys at the Brian Regan Show tonight at Caroline's.  If not, we'll see you guys tomorrow on the radio, too.  Okay?  But right.  We leave you with this.  Check it out. </pre>
