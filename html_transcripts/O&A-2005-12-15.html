<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the surprising success of *Brokeback Mountain*, with the hosts expressing their discomfort with the film's gay themes and speculating on its audience.  This segued into a recounting of Opie's recent J&R Music shopping trip, focusing on the logistical nightmare of transporting a large TV purchased with the help of their “sidecar,” Kenny.  Kenny's impressive strength was a recurring theme, with anecdotes about his feats of physical prowess, including carrying the TV on the subway, and a hypothetical fight between him and Jimmy "The Poe" Norton. The hosts then transitioned to discussing Howard Stern's impending departure from terrestrial radio, anticipating a large gathering of their listeners ("the Pests") outside the studio and addressing potential internal conflicts within their fanbase.  They also covered a news story about a lawsuit filed against former radio program director Frankie Blue, alleging physical assault and verbal abuse of a female DJ, Yvonne Velasquez.  Audio clips of Frankie Blue's rambling, incoherent, and profane on-air rant following the alleged incident were played.  The lawsuit details included allegations of harassment, bizarre behavior, and inappropriate comments about Velasquez's toes.  Her husband, Brian, was also suing for loss of consortium.

The show continued with a phone interview with Hugh Pinero, the president and CEO of XM Radio, who announced XM's signing of *Good Morning America* to its women's channel. This led to a discussion of XM's success compared to Sirius.  Further topics included the banning of a listener, "Joe Schmo from LA," several listener calls, and a news story about a 37-year-old woman pregnant after having sex with a 15-year-old boy.  Audio from the woman's *Good Morning America* interview was played, sparking a discussion on statutory rape and its legal ramifications. One of the hosts then shared a personal anecdote about a past experience involving statutory rape and its legal consequences. The conversation throughout this portion remained highly vulgar and sexually explicit.

Comedian Patrice O'Neal joined the show as a guest, delivering a lengthy and graphic account of his prison experience, including his arrest, conviction on rape charges, time spent among death row inmates, and his views on the legal system, race relations, and the complexities of rape accusations, particularly involving Black men.  The conversation then shifted to a poorly received new radio promo featuring "Toby," and the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where Opie and Anthony would be broadcasting.  Another guest, Laszlo, joined the discussion about CES and the future of radio and television technology. A listener later called in to describe nearly being involved in a car accident while listening to O'Neal's prison story.

The show then premiered several comedic audio spoofs: a tampon commercial jingle and a trailer for a fictional cyber-thriller, "The Mainframe," which parodied *Everybody Loves Raymond*.  Huey Lewis was interviewed in-studio, discussing his career, his Broadway experience in *Chicago*, *American Psycho*'s use of his music, the impact of *Back to the Future*, his views on commercial radio, the challenges of songwriting as he aged, and anecdotes about fame. The conversation also covered the changing music industry, Nirvana's impact, and comparisons of his fame to other artists. Stalker Patty, a recurring character, was mentioned and briefly interviewed after an encounter with Huey Lewis outside the studio.  The segment concluded with more humorous banter and a discussion about a child locator device.

The final segment began with a hypothetical scenario about a woman surviving without food, water, or supervision, followed by a discussion of the upcoming CES, focusing on new technology like a locator device and advancements in robotics, including the Honda ASIMO robot, which the hosts jokingly discussed using for sexual acts.  The hosts then discussed their personal lives and finances, with one mentioning his MySpace page ("stalker patty"), plans to attend a "million pest march," and financial difficulties, and the other discussing recent electronics purchases. A brief mention was made of a DVD player and PSP exchange between the hosts. The show concluded with a promotion of their website (lazlow.com) and an announcement that Patrice O'Neal, having had a makeover, would be on the next day.

[00:07:30]  with each other  on a movie  it's uncomfortable  to watch  whenever  there's a  man man kiss  in a movie  or something  even if it's some  peripheral storyline  in a movie  when was the last time  you saw a movie  with a man man kiss  you know something  I'm trying to think  I'm trying to have  an open mind  I'm like okay  alright I've seen  a lot of movies  it's always playful  comedy one  not the comedy man man kiss  no tootsie  yeah nothing like that  I'm talking like  the man man kiss  it's so god damn

[00:10:30]  we had a great time down there  it was a lot of fun  and the people at JNR Music  were just great to us  they were very kind  when are they delivering  your television  no I had Kenny  I had Kenny dragging  on the subway  you treat Kenny  club song  so bad  oh yeah  oh he was  he was watching you  back down there yesterday  oh he watches us  wherever we go  security  we need sidecar  Kenny is our man  and uh  yeah Kenny's our man  is he a dangerous guy?  oh yeah  is he a dangerous guy?  oh he'd fuck you up  if he had to  unbelievably dangerous 
[00:11:00]  why don't you put that on me  I'm a lover  just cause I'm fat  I gotta be  I gotta fight club song  unbelievably dangerous  if you're asking  that means you're thinking  so I'm just gonna make sure  you know right off the bat  that he'd kick your ass  cause you know  Norton thinks anybody's tough  he's always like  ah club song  compared to him yeah  but uh  I just  is he a dangerous guy  for real?  really?  look deep into his eyes  there's something wrong there  you haven't seen Kenny in action?  he likes to skip  and do goofy things  as a 6'5 guy  but look into those eyes deep  and you'll see there's problems  and I heard stories  fuck him up?  I don't know  we've uh 
[00:11:30]  we've uh  discussed that on many occasions  it would be a good fight  really?  yeah  yeah  oh the Poe  uh  Master Poe  uh  Club Soda Kenny fight  that'd be a good one  that'd be a really good  that's a movie finale fight  like the movie is  Poe kicking people's asses  and Kenny kicking people's asses  and they're on opposite sides  or something  yeah  and then the finale  oh yeah  is finally  these two are throwing  at each other  oh yeah  it's pay per view  and you wouldn't know  I just don't know Kenny  I've heard  I've seen him for years 
[00:12:00]  and heard about him  but I've never  I've heard stories  like  I've heard stories  about both these guys  I'm telling you  I've known Kenny longer  I would love to give Kenny the edge  but I'm not gonna do that  because I really don't know  you don't know  but uh  I've heard  I've heard both  both stories  so  you'd have to think with what  with sharpened sticks  I might have to give Poe the edge  with sharpened sticks  with sharpened sticks  Poe's good with a sharpened stick  but  knife fight  like a sword fighting with knives  I'm talking  I'm talking the one  where you gotta put the 
[00:12:30]  the woman's uh  with that  that thing that they put in their hair  a kerchief  in your mouth  and then you get the other end  to the other guy  and you gotta hold it in your teeth  as you're having a knife fight  oh yeah  so you gotta stay within  three feet of each other  you'll see that  no  god damn  Anthony's a  you're like a romantic  that's a good knife fight  what is wrong with you  that's  you bite on the end  of this silk scarf  that's what it is  and it's like three feet long  and the other guy's got  the other end of his mouth  and you can't let go  what was this doing  and then you're having a knife fight  medieval 
[00:13:00]  what was this  nah that was in a movie  I saw David Carradine  alright  I think if they're both using balloons  then Club Soda Kenny has the edge  how is he gonna kill someone with a balloon  nah it'll be a distraction though  I don't know  I think I'd give it to Poe  why  because I've never seen Kenny fight balloons  no fight with balloons  I've seen Poe fight balloons  they got balloons in their hands  right  you know then they figure out  what to do with the balloons  Kenny's mellow though  I don't think  I think Poe would be more up for it  I don't know  like if he's trying to set up Poe 
[00:13:30]  that's just it  there's this underlying thing  Kenny is mellow  that's what I'm saying  I'm not saying  that makes him more dangerous  I'm saying Kenny's just like a dude  that looks like he's not trying  like you  you have no idea  Poe you kinda know  he enjoys knowing karate  or  whatever  whatever  whatever he knows  he enjoys knowing it  enjoys knowing that you know it  but Kenny  I've never seen Kenny  do nothing but ask you  do you need some water  Kenny will walk through  I'll tell you really fast 
[00:14:00]  we had a situation at Caroline's  at the Jim Norton show  I watched Kenny push three guys  up the stairs  and you know how  and you know how steep  those stairs are right  right  right right  and uh  and Keith the cop  was helping out too  and he got pushed up the stairs  oh when Kenny has to  take care of business  take care of business  it's brutal  he'll smile  and tell somebody like  have a nice day  and then snap someone's neck  with the same smile on his face  that's what I'm saying  that's the dude  that's you know  he pushed three guys 
[00:14:30]  up the stairs  those Caroline stairs  like it was nothing  yeah I'd have to  I'm telling you  I don't know who I'd give the edge to  but anyway  J&R Music was great yesterday  and uh  then we went on a shopping spree  a shopping spree  wasn't that fun  J&R Music  they uh  they own the whole block  a whole block  in New York City  it's unbelievable  except for some  god damn hardware store  they can't seem to get rid of  hardware store  yeah right in between  like the J&R Music  oh that's the guy  that's holding out  and the J&R Computer World  and stuff like that  there's this hardware store

[00:15:30]  out on Long Island  and they started laughing at me  they only have one store  but they advertise so well  you just feel like  you've been in there  like they're everywhere  and the one store  they do have  is just  it's like  five stores  even Arabs  no  no  no  American people  yeah  it's unbelievable  there's so many employees  there's an elevator guy  that brings you up  and down the floors  and  yeah very nice  and then you have to go  on the street  to go into another department  it's an unbelievable organization  went over to the computer side  and uh  had a field day over there  and you were over there 
[00:16:00]  by the TVs  and the digital cameras  and  I spent three grand yesterday  I was just going crazy  and uh  people know  I don't really spend money often  I just went nuts  digital cameras  and PSPs  those stores  that TV's at your house already  oh yeah  and I got a  uh  32 inch  uh  LCD  high def  for the uh  bedroom  yeah  nice  it's already there  it's already hooked up  nah  it's just on the floor  where Kenny left it  nice  you really had Kenny  bring it home on the train  fuck yeah

[00:17:00]  you can imagine  and you know the boxes  are like ten times bigger  than the TVs that are in them  yeah  you ever get a TV delivered  and like the boxes  how did he do that  he's a monster  it doesn't matter about monsters  it matters about a balance  yeah physically  I'm saying  he keeps acting like  I'm questioning his physical prowess  I'm saying  how did he do it  they got cutouts in the box  which is probably  meant for two people  but he just grabbed it  on one end  grabbed it on  it was like this  he doesn't have a wingspan  like a condor  I'm stretching out 
[00:17:30]  and he's fucking carrying  your fucking TV  on the fucking train  like a goddamn slave  you just  you just  you couldn't say  nah  don't do  your soul  absolutely not  your soul couldn't say  Kenny don't do that man  yeah you know  you could have gone to the guys  and gone  J&R  you have this delivered  this afternoon  to my house  and they would have  absolutely delivered  how much did you give them  huh  how much did you give them  I gave them a few bucks  and then I bought them dinner  but then someone else  picked up the tab  because they get expensive 
[00:18:00]  through XM  they insisted  so  dinner with Wicklin  it was  no it was Mike  oh  Mike who helped out  helped us with the shopping spree  but uh  now we're on the subway  and the box is just getting  in everyone's way  everyone is annoyed  you should put that thing  together at least  before the time  it would have took  for J&R to deliver it  well that's what I'm saying  because now  or else  then it makes  him carrying it  it's horrible  yeah  right  he has no gloves  no hat  and he's just carrying  like 30 twists

[00:19:30]  just insists though  Anthony knows  Anthony wants  I know  it's uncomfortable  Anthony wants to  throw me under the bus  but the reality is  Kenny just insists  to the point where  you go alright  just let him do it  I can't use  Kenny's services though  like you do  I don't know what it is  and there's nothing  wrong with it  but I can't  like I had to make  all kinds of  airline reservations  for a cruise  that I'm going on  in April  he takes care of  my vacation  and everything now  and I know  I could have called  Kenny  and he would book it 
[00:20:00]  like a travel agent  and have everything  ready for me  but I just can't  bring myself  to call him up  and do that  and he's offered  no I pay him though  he needs  what's Kenny's job  what's his job title  he's just  I'm a personal assistant  he's like a jack of all trades  dude you should call him  because I pay him  a little extra  and then he's  he's got some spending money  now I gotta talk to you  what do you pay him  because I don't wanna make  either  I don't wanna look bad  or I don't wanna make  you look bad  so it has to be  the same amount  nah it just  it depends on 
[00:20:30]  what he's doing for me  see that's just it  he booked a hotel  recently for me  and I threw him  what 40 50 bucks  to book a hotel  something like that  yeah  just a quickie  that's a little expensive  huh  what hotel  it was  was it a pricey hotel  yeah  because everything was sold out  and he got you  okay now that's fine then  alright  actually you got me into a hotel  I just thought you didn't wanna pick up a phone  and call a hotel  cause I've been  oh no I won't do that  I've been in a jam  where they have no hotel rooms  no Kenny knows how to work his way around  all this stuff  cause he'll  there's a back story to the whole thing 
[00:21:00]  yeah he works  you know he was a road manager for Dice for many years  so he knows the ins and outs  so when a hotel tells you they're sold out  Kenny knows other ways to possibly get a room in that hotel  you're not with Dice anymore Kenny?  and he did just that  nah  he didn't know?  no  no  no  he dumped his whole entourage  I don't know what he does now  but I wish him well  oh okay  yeah look at that diplomatic guy  oh yeah  and then he was on a show recently in Philly I'm hearing  and saying  and I guess our names came up  and he said something like

[00:27:30]  about Howie  it's his  you know  it's his moment  in the sun  we had the same  thing happen  in a little over  a year ago  when you go  from regular radio  to satellite  they make a big deal  so there's a whole  article on Howie  leaving and stuff  and we get about  two paragraphs  in the article  and it doesn't  make us happy  today  so we might have  another mission  for the pests  you gotta look  at the source  Opie  you have to look  at the source  of the quote  ok  Inside Radio  Inside Radio  this is a 
[00:28:00]  website I guess  InsideRadio.com  yeah  they  it's a radio  industry website  but it's a  broadcast radio  any of these  radio websites  that are up  there now  like the New York  Radio Message  Board  Radio Info  FMQB.com  is another one  these are big  like radio  traditional  broadcast radio  sites  they aren't too  hip to  satellite radio  the people  that go on  their message  boards and 
[00:28:30]  what not  don't like  satellite radio  they don't see  it succeeding  they have this  vision of it  like it's not  even there  meanwhile  it's growing  by leaps and  bounds every day  they're old  fogies  it's like  back in the day  when the Beatles  started to hit  and there were  people going  ah  the Beatles  please  they refuse to  get satellite  radio  so they don't  know  what impact  satellite has  how people are  enjoying it  how great it is  to own 
[00:29:00]  great alternative  to regular radio  so you gotta  kinda look at  the source  they really are  they're out of  touch  with technology  and what's  going on  in satellite radio  well this is  irresponsible  journalism though  because I gotta  tell you one thing  we've been doing  radio a long time  Anthony and I  together well over  ten years now  right and  I don't know  I've never felt  more exposure  for our show  yep  than what's  going on right  now  never  we have so much  national attention 
[00:29:30]  we never had this  type of national  attention on regular  radio  here and there  we did  here and there  we'd get our  chance to be on  a national TV show  or do this or that  and maybe go in a  penthouse  so we had it  but nothing to the  extent that we're  seeing now  we're in articles  every day  yeah  like our  exposure is way  the fuck up  there  we're on the  back page of  the New York  Post today  XM took out  another great  Opie and Anthony  advertising  yeah  you know  Opie and Anthony  only on XM  radio  it's on the 
[00:30:00]  back page of the  New York  Post which is  basically the  sports  well it is  the sports  section  yep  and we got  great exposure  on that  today  so this guy  Tom Street  editor of  Inside Radio  he writes  and although  Street predicts  Stern will  succeed  he also says  Stern faces the  possibility of  fading in the  media limelight  as Radio  Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  did when they  moved to XM  fading in the  radio  well we faded in  terrestrial radio  that's for sure  we're not on that  anymore  we didn't fade away 
[00:30:30]  though  but uh  yeah  we didn't fade away  at all  we got a lot of  attention because of  our assault on the  media campaign  that was a huge  national thing that  just happened what  last week  so that's something  fresh that he could  have referenced  actually  no nothing  and then he says  I think you can  look at what  happens to Opie and  Anthony who are  talented guys and at  the same time you  could say they  become far less  visible  on regular radio  yeah  far less visible  because we're not 
[00:31:00]  on radio  on broadcast radio  our audience at  this point is  huge  yeah  and growing every  day  just trust me on  that it's huge  we can't keep up  with the email that  comes in  we just can't keep  up with it  it's gotten to  that point  and it's just  going to get better  from here  so to say we just  kind of faded away  is just irresponsible  getting bashed by  inside radio  um  it doesn't really  bother me  really doesn't  I  you gotta look at  the source  I understand 
[00:31:30]  but it's in USA  today  that's a  pretty big  newspaper  yeah  and it's on the  front page of the  life section  well maybe  we ought to show  in the middle of the  paper  it's not buried  it's right on the  front page of the  life line  maybe we ought to  show inside radio  how much we've  faded away  maybe our listeners  can show them  that you only  number maybe 10  or 20 people  and go to  inside radio  dot com  isn't there a dash  in there somewhere  no it's just  inside radio  dot com  inside radio  dot com 
[00:32:00]  I check out their  website every morning  to see what's going on  in the radio  listeners want to  check out  inside radio  dot com  and send a couple  emails maybe  is that an order  sir  that is an order  alright  that's all I need  to know  that's it  go ahead  have fun  have fun with it  kids  you want to throw me  that box of tissues  there Hawk  are you a little  under the weather  no I just  you know  got a little  moisture  oh very good  it's not  it's not like  you know 
[00:32:30]  I gotta blow it  but it gets chilly  Patrice is like  what's wrong  with you guys  alright  let's say hi  to big ass member  he was at the  J&R music thing  yesterday  what's up  big ass member  nothing much  also known as  BAM  yes also known as  BAM  getting ready for  tomorrow morning  just planning and  planning  getting more and  more pests  signing up every  minute  seems to be a  I don't know  almost a coup  a coup  looking to happen  in the O&A army  between BAM here 
[00:33:00]  and Doug out Doug  no you guys  gotta stay together  stop with this crap  you don't need  dissension in the ranks  absolutely not  no I love Doug  he's great  for once can we all  just stay together  they're trying to  pull power from  each other  you have to  address it now  before  don't let it  boil  that's what girls do  let it boil  underneath  you gotta let it out  maybe y'all should  fight or maybe  we should have a  talk or  and just  somebody gotta  concede you  can't let this  happen  you can't do that  we gotta do it 
[00:33:30]  like Hitler  or Stalin does  and every so often  just kill everybody  and get a hold  you can't have  this undercurrent  of I'm better  than you  you know that  we have fan sites  that hate each other  how does that make  sense  they battle  with each other  it's not good man  they have started  these sites  for the same reason  both sides  love the Opie and  Anthony show  but these sites  hate each other  yeah  it's amazing  it's mind-boggling  you can't have that  kind of  you can't have  like again  the scene from  Scarface 
[00:34:00]  you expect me to believe  Omar was a stoolie  cause Salsa said so  Salsa said so  you can't do that man  you cannot  you gotta just  massage each other's back  just give it to them  in terms of  what is it  seniority or some shit  you can't beef  you cannot beef  you guys gotta stick together  absolutely  the army loves each other  this is really a call  right now  to everyone who's  there is that  dissension between  different message boards  but this is a time  for everyone to unite 
[00:34:30]  everyone to get out  there tomorrow morning  it's gonna be a massive march  we're gonna take on  hoo-hoo  we're gonna bring it  right to his face  and just say  hey listen  we're here  and this is  this is what we're about  you've been ripping off  people for years  and we're gonna start  telling the truth  and we are the pioneers  that's right  and you guys  can't embarrass us tomorrow  you guys gotta  have some numbers tomorrow  you don't want them  to show up then?  if 20 people show up  at the station  with a couple cute signs  we're fucked  we look like idiots  absolutely  everyone should actually  now because  there's a rumor  that he might be  moving things  slightly earlier 
[00:35:00]  should probably get  to the station  at latest  at latest  by 730  just you know  just so everyone's there  with plenty of time  for us to make it over  we're gonna be meeting  outside of XM  which is on 57th Street  between 6th and 7th  and we'll be walking over  alright  and it's a call to arms  so whoever wants to join  the gang  come on down  here's the deal though  I mean we've been saying it  for well over a week now  you guys gotta be peaceful  you have to  you have to keep it peaceful  we sent out a detailed list 
[00:35:30]  of instructions  on how people have to behave  when they attend  you know  including you know  no fighting  no bringing air horns  bull horns  anything like that  that might cause  any trouble at all  if there's any problems  you find with police  and you just behave yourself  surely visual  there's one more plug  I gotta give  I know I gave  Metro Printing  yesterday in Cajun  North Cal  I gotta just say  thank you to  Brandon McKinney  aka Balloon Knot B  on Waxback  he actually designed  the cartoon  on the Pest t-shirt  they got t-shirts made 
[00:36:00]  banners made  which is absolutely phenomenal  make sure you guys  have a lot of XM logos  absolutely  we have tons  and I have one more  little tease  for the Pest  we actually have  foam middle fingers  that say hoo-hoo  on it  like a sporting event  we're looking for the Pest  to be more clever  as we move forward  so  I'm gonna state that  every time we talk  about the Pest  cause a lot of people  are like  ah the Pest 
[00:36:30]  they're gonna get  Opie and Anthony  in trouble eventually  I don't think so  we love the Pest  we love what they do  for the show  we just want them  to be smarter  and more clever  that's all  how does Sonny Pest  and Michael Pest  you know what I mean  Coleon  is there a bunch  of Sonny Pests  where they gotta  a bunch of Sonnies  yeah  you know  dad gotta say  shut your fucking mouth  you don't tell everybody  no in general  they've  they've  have stayed out of trouble  the Pest  and they've done  some great work for us  cause Bam sounds political  Bam sounds like  you know  one of the 
[00:37:00]  the negotiators  yeah  so it was Dougie Doug  like you know  let's chop a head off  Doug is more Sonny  yeah he's a hothead  that's what it is  that's the faction  that  Doug is a  you know  I like Doug  but he's a hothead  you make the deal  Bam  you make the deal  we do it  Doug last night  on Pal Talk  oh my god  I was laughing my balls off  we have Doug on the line too  Doug out Doug  what the Pal Talk  it's just  it's just practice  for being assholes 
[00:37:30]  yeah  you can hear it  actually Anthony  was explaining Pal Talk  and what you guys  have been doing  lately  in the office  in the office  I was talking about it  we hadn't even hit on it  on the air yet  but last night  I go into this thing  it's called Pal Talk  and it's like webcams  you get your webcam  and you can hook up  and now you can look at people  on their webcams  chat  either through text  or through microphones  so you're talking  back and forth  and you can see people  in front of their computers  doing whatever  girls show their tits  and you know  it's just kind of a hang 
[00:38:00]  and there's a  a whack bag room  so I'm hanging out in there  and you know  just talking about  things and laughing  and then they go on  these room raids  that are so fucking funny  because there's different  categories of rooms  that you can go to  on this Pal Talk  there's adults only sections  and then there's  ethnic sections  sexual sections  and then under those sections  there's a whole bunch  of sub sections  you know  by men looking for  blah blah blah 
[00:38:30]  proud Africans  look and you go there  and it's just like  these guys  are like the  guys up the street  in Times Square  just talking  you know  fuck the white man  the white devil  we gotta rise up  yeah the Israelites  and then these guys  go on these room raids  where I am laughing  my ass off  because they got  dude they got more  sound clips  the listeners  than we do  and they play them  in these rooms  so we go into  a few of the black rooms  and Doug out  Doug starts playing  some of our favorite songs 
[00:39:00]  that we've played on this  like this guy gets  through pontificating  about you know  the white devil  is holding us down  my brothers  we must rise up  and goes on  for like 15 minutes  and you sit there  listening  and then all of a sudden  you see a little microphone  appear next to  Doug out Doug's name  and you go  oh no  he goes  well ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to play  a little song  that I think  tells you my feelings  bout bout bout  the house next door  to me  was sold  to niggers  it is so funny 
[00:39:30]  yeah this one  will kick up  and this is over  now they can all  hear this  there's like 50  black people listening  the house next door  to me  he's been sold  to niggers  and this guy  was just preaching  with his heart  about the white man  and the devil  and that's why Doug  you can hear  the fucking  you can hear  where the problem is  Doug is a headhunter  he has angst 
[00:40:00]  he doesn't care  about you guys  he just wants death  he wants to be  in there  with heads up on spikes  where people come  to worship him  and then  you know  a fucking  big ass member  is probably going  and he's  probably a little nervous  of Doug  and then he met  and he goes  he does this  you know Doug  people aren't going  to pay attention  so if you can  we want black  pets too  you know  Doug there's a part  of what you do 
[00:40:30]  there's a part  of what you do  that does serve  a purpose  but  I didn't know  you could imitate  Pat for messing  out  Jesus  Doug can you  stop antagonizing  for five fucking  heads  it is the funniest  god damn thing  and then the gay rooms  you go into the gay rooms  again  some gay guy  will just be going  on and on  about the gay lifestyle  and how  you know  there's so much  gay bashing  going on  and boom  pop in 
[00:41:00]  and I had a little  fun last night  Andrew Dice  gay made an appearance  in one of the gay rooms  which was a lot of fun  I was instantly  bounced from the room  they threw me  right the fuck out  they banned you  oh banned  banned in a second  I was like  why can't two men  just enjoy  each other's assholes  boom  gone  out of the gay room  oh I thought you were  typing Andrew  oh no you can say it  okay I got it now  because when you were  telling me in the office  I'm like you were  imitating Dice 
[00:41:30]  what  no you can actually  say it  I got it now  and then you look  at everybody  because everybody else  from whack bag  is up on their  cameras and everything  so you look and just  watch everybody  laughing their asses off  it's like you're  hanging out  it's very fun  you do realize  at this point  the Opie and Anthony  show just doesn't end  we just pop in  four hours a day  these guys continue  with the Opie and Anthony  show on their own  oh my god  that's what this has become  that by the way  was like  11 o'clock last night  you should have  these two come down  you should have  these two come down  and do some type  of handshake 
[00:42:00]  I just know people  I'm a genius with this shit  there's a problem here  that has to stop  is there a problem  between you guys  Doug you can hear  the way Doug gets  on the phone  you heard it  like man's like  you know  hey guys  you didn't hear Doug  not once agree  with no air horns  he gave motherfuckers  the two wink  bring an air horn  motherfucker  somebody's ears  is getting blown  I want to see  somebody's drum  on the floor  on the fucking floor  bleeding  fucking curse  from Apocalypse Now  Doug gets on the phone  hello  what's up motherfuckers  Pam's like  good morning 
[00:42:30]  ladies and gentlemen  hi yes  we're gonna be down there  we're stressing  that people come  and the numbers  I don't give a fuck  if it's just me  someone's going down  and this pest name  motherfucker  I wanna be a bug  fuck pest  nigga that's  faggy shit  I wanna be a hyena  man's like the loyal  order of pests  there's gonna be pests  and hyenas  hello  he taps a glass  with a pen  tick tick tick  hello  calm down  calm down  let's see what's going on here  so Doug what do you got  Jesus Christ 
[00:43:00]  there's your intro  a ten minute intro  for Doug  I just really know  how to push people's buttons  and one of the most entertaining  things in the world  is people reacting  I just love that  see that's why I love Doug  see I understand that  completely  and that's why  when I do get my space  eventually I'm only gonna have one friend  dug out Doug  that's it  because he understands  huh  what about me  Bam  yeah  you're more like a  you're more like a friend  than Anthony would watch  but I'm the same way as Doug 
[00:43:30]  that's how I know  it's just like  it's not  it just leaves the problem  that's what I'm saying  I'm the same way  I like to see people hurt  that's why this show works so well  you know Anthony  much more diplomatic than I  I'm just like an ass  I'll just sit back  I'm just an ass  I'll sit back and laugh my ass off  like when  last night  one of the guys  Kev Slider  black guy  comes on  to the board  and he's a friend  and he's part of  you know  whack bag and everything  and comes on  and he is greeted  by some of the most racist  clips and songs 
[00:44:00]  by the members  of the fucking board  it's hysterical  and I just sit back  and laugh my ass off  you guys are a rip  on that fucking thing  alright so Doug  what do you got today  uh yeah  so tomorrow  yeah  tomorrow yes  and you have no real problem  with Bam right  no absolutely not  Bam and I work very closely  on this actually  on the phone every day  emailing  he did most of the leg work  on this  because he's up there  and I'm probably not 
[00:44:30]  going to be able  to make it up there  due to the fact  that I got to take a test  because I'm trying  to get a job  uh  he um  he's done a lot  of the work  and is  I mean  if this thing goes off  it is  attributed mostly to him  if it goes off  the way it is  because he  he accolades  alright that sounds good  you guys honestly  think there's going to be  hundreds of people there  yeah absolutely  representing us  lots of messages  and what we're banking on  is we're banking on  uh  you know people  that aren't part  of message boards  showing up  you know  just showing up  for the free  uh free lunch 
[00:45:00]  uh that we're supplying  tomorrow  and uh  where's free lunch again  uh at the hard rock  hard rock cafe  that's right  what's the success  in numbers  and what's the failure  in numbers  you would say  well  noticeable  or huge  huge noticeable  presence  it all depends  on how many numbers  he has there also  so  yeah that's what  it's got to be  yeah anything  it's got to be  a huge noticeable  number  anything less than  like uh  five  anything less than  200 people tomorrow  gonna need a lot of  people  gonna need a lot of  people  and uh  actually we fucked up 
[00:45:30]  uh one of his rallies  uh with xm's help  and we only used  like 25 people  we only had 25 people  the thing is  the props  completely fucked it up  these people have  what i will call  the props  that uh  will really make  a statement  it'll make  you could make  four people  look like 40  with some of the  stuff i've seen  uh that they are  bringing with them  have you heard that  story yet patrice  when howie announced  he's going to satellite  right he does  this big rally  down in union square  and um  there was a lot of  people there  not gonna lie to you  there was a lot  and we uh 
[00:46:00]  coordinated this  whole thing  we got hotel rooms  we had walkie talkies  we had this whole  thing that we worked  out right  and just as he hit  the stage  we went go go go  anthony and i  were watching from  above from a hotel  room  on the whole  damn thing  see this is why  we're gonna win  eventually  because we still  have the passion  to do this shit  he's too fucking  lazy just driving  around in big limos  and he doesn't  he doesn't give a  fuck anymore  that's a fact  so it's just a  matter of time  we we spent a lot 
[00:46:30]  of time and effort  on this whole thing  we were in this  hotel room on a  ledge with walkie  talkies and i  watching the whole  scene down below  and we gave the  signal go go go  and then uh  people and there  was only like 25 30  came from all  directions with huge  opian anthony xm  banners and just  just infiltrated the  whole mess that was  going on down there  we have pictures of  howard staring right at  the xm stuff with the  look of he just wanted to  kill somebody  he was so fucking pissed  and anytime he's out 
[00:47:00]  now doing any kind of  public appearance  there they are  the pests are there  every single time  right in his face  that's one of our  mantras wherever he  goes we go  simple as that  it's supposed to show  just who has a passion  i mean they were  talking about showing  up at your jr music  appearance yesterday  and not a single one  showed  no  not one  he doesn't give a fuck  about his listeners  when it comes down to  it  doug and bam  here's a daniel  from alabama  let's see how well  you two are appreciated  here  please let doug and bam

[00:52:30]  for skipping  their 2004  Christmas party  Yvonne  Velasquez  says former  program director  Frankie Blue  physically assaulted  her for not  sharing in the  company's holiday  cheer  who the fuck  are you  not to come  to our  Christmas party  Velasquez  quotes Blue  as screaming  you are such  a fucking  diva  he continued  this is stuff  we had no idea  we just got  the tape  of him  actually going  on the air  let's see  you're a fucking  diva 
[00:53:00]  he continued  what did you  think  you're better  than everybody  Blue followed  up that  performance  by going  on air  so this is  the shit  that happened  before he  went on air  we always  wondered  what had  happened  that took  the jock  that was  supposed to  be on the  air  off the air  and allowed  Frankie Blue  to then  take her  place  drunk off  his ass  and broadcast  our own  Earl was  there by  the way  that's right  he was  running the  board  and he  said that  there was  a problem  between the  two  he didn't  get to hear  it though  but he saw  it through 
[00:53:30]  the glass  and this  is apparently  what was said  now  this woman  is saying  he was saying  this stuff  to her  I think  to bring  everyone  into the  story  they had  this weird  thing  where they  had the  Christmas  party  at lunch  time  or in  the middle  of the day  or something  like that  I guess  they assumed  if you  had to  work  after the  Christmas  party  you weren't  going to  get tanked  right  well I've  been in a  situation  in my  career  where they  have these  Christmas  parties  and I'm  the dude  that has  to go  on the  air  so you're  exactly  right  you're like  god damn  everyone's  getting drunk  around you  you can't 
[00:54:00]  you can't  especially back  then I didn't  have any  power  I went on  the air  drunk  I was  fired  the next  day  no problem  so that's  probably  what happened  so she  decides not  to go  to the  Christmas  party  Frankie  Blue  comes back  from the  Christmas  party  he's  fucking  hammered  so we  think  he's on  something  it's obvious  when you hear  the tape  please  and now  he's yelling  and screaming  at her  and calling  her a  fucking  diva  what did  you think  you're  better than  everybody  Blue  followed up  that performance  by going  on air  where he  allegedly  used the  F word  again  and referred  to the  station 
[00:54:30]  by the  wrong  call  letters  he was  bounced  from the  station  a few  weeks  later  yeah  he went  on the  air  and started  using the  call letters  of the  competition  where he  made big  right  the party  the suit  says the  x-rated  Christmas  rant  happened  on  December  15th  2004  which is  a year  ago  today  by the  way  when Velasquez  showed up  at 730  PM  for her  8 PM  on air  shift  the party  had taken  place  earlier  that day  and Velasquez  had earlier  told Blue  she had to  miss it  because of  family  obligations  the suit  says 
[00:55:00]  by the time  she arrived  at the  station  Blue  was seeing  red  anyway  and verbally  abused  and discriminated  against  the married  mother of  two  the suit  says  all you  care about  are your  kids  and being  a mother  the suit  says  he screamed  at her  in front  of other  employees  you don't  care about  this job  all you care  about is  your family  oh my god  what are you  doing man  you cunt  yeah  what are you  doing having  family values  bitch  oh shit  he then  began  wow  he then began  violently grabbing  and shaking  Velasquez 
[00:55:30]  pushing her  into his office  where he pinned  her up against  the wall  the suit  says  oh boy  and he punched  the wall  next to her  face three times  while screaming  fucking diva  oh boy  this was all  before he went  on the air  and we got the  tape of him  on the air  it's coming up  in a minute  or two here  Velasquez  and her aide  wound up having  to run down  the staircase  with Blue  chasing her  the suit  says  while driving  home to get  away from him  she turned  on the radio  and heard Blue  on the air  during her  time slot  at times  mumbling  slurring 
[00:56:00]  and cursing  the suit  says  yeah  he was gone  yeah  go feed  your fucking  kid  yeah  her one million  dollar  suit  says  the incident  caused her  severe  permanent  personal  injuries  well  of course  it did  severe  permanent  personal  injuries  these lawsuits  you know  of course  the guy  was an asshole  to her  but  this ain't  worth  a million  bucks  it ain't worth  ten bucks  you had a hard  time at work  your boss  was an asshole  he got fired  there you go  I don't know  violent punching  against the wall 
[00:56:30]  near your face  is a little  bigger than  a hard time  ten bucks  for a guy  before a bitch  it's at least  half a mil  probably puts up  a worse  you never know  yeah sexual harassment  but not violence  I mean a booty  squeeze is different  from just punching  a fucking wall  next to your face  yeah  permanent injuries  severe permanent  personal injuries  she wakes up  with nightmares  yeah  oh  oh  oh  Frankie  I do love my child  it also names  Mix 1027  and it's owners  charging they had  ignored Blue's 
[00:57:00]  earlier bizarre  behavior toward her  including repeatedly  commenting on her  looks and toes  oh boy  bitch look at  the one next to  the big toe  it's longer  how you feel  about that  ugly toe ho  who hired  this ugly toe  bitch  do you think  she laughed  you look like  you're walking  on coals  all day long  rusty foot  bitch  what you gonna  go take care  of your rusty  toe kid  stinking ass 
[00:57:30]  hoe  you think  she laughed  though  when he did  the toe shit  no  before that  no  some of these  suits  that people  bring up  it sounds  real bad  but as it's  happening  people are  kind of like  oh well  yeah  that toe  is bigger  you know  cause it's  your boss  and you wanna  keep your job  and shit  and he's talking  about my toes  and she put  her foot up  you think my toe  I can't  I can't wear  open toe  shoes  anymore  and my fucking

[00:58:30]  physically  close to her  during her  shows  uh oh  this poor  lady has a  family  just wants  to do  her shift  and go  home  and he  has the  fucking  hats  for it  radios  filled  with these  people  that  they just  want to  do their  dumb  shift  play  their  stupid  tunes  and go  home  get out  of there  go deal  with a  frankie  blue  and it  just goes  on  also suing  blue  in the  station  is  velasquez  her husband  brian  who says  he has  been  deprived  of the  comfort  of  his wife 
[00:59:00]  because of  the incident  because he  agreed with  the feet  thing  he said  stop it  you know  you got  some ugly  feet  and she's  like  stop  giving  them  pussy  holy  shit  baby  could you  suck  on my  toes  tonight  nigga  I'll sue  that bitch  I wouldn't  even  sue  guys  are so  pussy  man  can you do  pat again  now you know that you're imitating her

[01:09:30]  I love the part  about how they're  going to  fuck the winner  that's a hell  of a  that's a hell  of a content  it's great too  how he  like a  professional  disc jockey  just talks  all over  the vocals  like you're  supposed to  stop talking  when the music  when the vocals  of the song  kicks in  he steps all over  it  yeah when you're  doing a music  shift  where you're  just playing  the list of  songs they  hand to you  every day  yeah that's  the one thing  they don't want  you to do  is talk over  the vocals  that's all  they ask 
[01:10:00]  you know  figure it out  here it is  again  now what's  going to  happen is  they're going  to pull  they're going  to put their  hand in the  barrel  they're going  to pick out  a winner  and then  they're going  to fuck  that winner  and that winner  will be rewarded  with everything  mix 1027  Frankie Blue  what's happening  good evening  hey where's the  part where he  called it the  wrong station  did we hear that  at the beginning  of the clip  where was that 
[01:10:30]  it was in  there somewhere  whatever  it's okay  so there you go  there's the update  the reason he  went on the air  was because he  he pretty much  abused the DJ  that was supposed  to do the shift  and she ran out  and then he went  on the air  hammered  or whatever  he was under  and now she's  suing for a million  dollars  have fun  have fun with that  alright we're  going to take a  break  can we play 
[01:11:00]  something at the  break here Hawk  what do you  got anything  good  a new story  in the Wall  Street Journal  I guess that's  a pretty well  respected rag  yeah  when Howard Stern  announced last year  that he was moving  from traditional  broadcast radio  to satellite  he promised to  crush the old  medium and bring  hordes of fans  with him to  subscription based  Sirius  now just weeks  before he begins  with his new show  on Sirius  Mr. Stern must  prove he can  deliver on his  promise to justify 
[01:11:30]  the 500 million  dollars Sirius  is paying him  but amid a  crucial holiday  season for Sirius  the fledgling  satellite radio  provider faces  a problem  despite the  hoopla  surrounding Mr.  Stern  rival XM  satellite radio  still has a  70% market share  in satellite radio  and is continuing  to sign up  far more  customers  how about that  huh  take that  fuck face  that's it  continues to  sign up 
[01:12:00]  far more  customers  and with that  said  big announcement  from XM  satellite radio  moments away  we're going to  have Elo on  the phone  in a little  while  who's your  big chain  the big XM  chain  everybody  it's everywhere  now  no I mean  the big deal  well if we  mention one  then the other  one's going to  get pissed  but it's like  Circuit City  Best Buy  that's aftermarket  stuff  you know  that's like  people that go  in and want to  buy like  the MiFi  handheld  boombox  the  you want to 
[01:12:30]  install it  in your car  if it doesn't  have it  but see  here's where  XM is brilliant  they knew  it had to get  into the autos  had to get  into the cars  right off the  assembly line  people don't  like hassles  they don't want  you know  if you like  satellite radio  and stuff  and you're  kind of a  techie  this is  especially  a couple  of years  back  when satellite  first kind  of kicked  in  not everyone  has a  club soda  candy  that's going  to install  it for you  it's going  to be under  the dash  I've  hardwired  everything  for you  OP  because you're 
[01:13:00]  so handsome  thank you  Kenny  here's $15  enjoy  yeah that's it  not everyone  has that  so they knew  a lot of people  out there like me  I'd rather buy a car  that just has it  although it's gotten  a lot better  it really has  oh yeah  I mean  years ago  you had to  kind of be a  tech head  it was a brand  new technology  so you'd go  to Circuit City  or wherever  and pick up  a unit  and put it  in your car  but it wasn't  for you know  everybody 
[01:13:30]  but when these  things roll  off the assembly  line with them  already installed  ready to go  it's part of  your system  like mine  it's right there  in my radio  and navigation  system and  everything  and that's  where XM  knew they  had to be  very smart  and that's  where a majority  of these  customers are  that's the whole  point of  satellite radio  is to drive  and you don't  have to change  the channel  that's it  that's the whole  point of  that's why  the truckers  love it too  yeah they can 
[01:14:00]  drive from New York  to LA  and never have  to change  the station  as simple as that  that's what it is  and simple as this  when we go off  the air  XM has so much  variety  so many other  things to check out  that's a fact  but Sirius was so  fixated on  things like  Howie  that they dropped  the ball on  everything else  they thought that  was going to be  the cure all  and you know  what am I reading  here  the weekly world  news  the national  inquirer  about this  no  it's the  wall street  journal  saying 
[01:14:30]  amid a  crucial holiday  season  XM  is  outselling  serious  that's  that's just  the way it  is  they thought  he was going  to come in  to swoop in  and for months  in advance  before he comes  on  they were going  to be selling  units  sorry  we'll be the  first to admit  the old Howie  definitely gets  the job done  this Howie  no fucking way  no  like 1994  Howie  no fucking way  up to a 1994 
[01:15:00]  Howie  gets the job  done  we beat him  up all the time  and he can't  take it  yeah  the old Howie  would have  would have had  something to say  simple as that  where did he go  where did he go  where'd you go  old Howie  wouldn't you love  to talk to the  old Howie  at this point  Howie  wouldn't  wouldn't  new Howie  like to go  back and talk  to old Howie  old Howie  would punch  new Howie  in the face  he certainly  would  he would  punch that  old lady  the old lady 
[01:15:30]  in the face  the old lady  in the face  don't you realize  old Howie  would be making  fun of new Howie  old Howie  would go  new Howie  why are you  wearing a  boy scout  uniform  Billy West  would be  doing a parody  of new Howie  new Howie  on old Howie  old Howie  would be like  what the fuck  why are you  wearing hip hop  clothes at 55  years old  Jackie would be  writing jokes  passing them  to old Howie  to goof on  new Howie  exactly  look at new Howie  old Howie  would have a lot 
[01:16:00]  to say  about new Howie  yeah  well  even  even Howie  believes in  XM Satellite Radio  I got proof  right here  do you want  to kiss me  or  really  is that what  he would say  he probably  would say  that to  his former  self  I stink  at pushing  buttons  today  alright  we're going  to continue  but listen  how are we  talking about  XM Satellite Radio  if you're planning  a road trip  this weekend  it's time  to take  XM Satellite Radio

[01:21:30]  we'll take a bad word  and make it worse  we-member  I'll be in a three  listen to the crew  there's too many men  too many people 
[01:22:00]  making too many problems  and there's not a part  you love to go around  and to me  this is the land  of confusion  this is the world  we live in  and these are the  I love this Phil Collins  that was a great interview  yesterday with Disturb  or David from Disturb  and I hate being responsible 
[01:22:30]  because I really wanted  to go to the show  last night  I didn't go  you're such a fucking phony  you said to  I swear to god  I wanted to go see Disturb  I love those guys  did you go to Geraldo's  Carolines  no I blew that off  don't be such an answer  hold on a minute man  I gotta stick up for myself  usually when I tell someone  I'm gonna be there  I'm there  I really am  I forgot what happened  something was going on  where I had a bail on  Greg Geraldo  and I'm kind of bummed  about that  I wasn't going anywhere  hour and 40 minutes 
[01:23:00]  to get home last night  an hour and 40 minutes  because I was right at  the height of rush hour  when I finally got back here  it's a 20 minute drive  oh because of the J&R music  yeah we did J&R  and I'm not even talking  about getting from  downtown J&R  to back up here  to get my car  and drive  I'm talking from here  to my house  an hour and 40 minute drive  when did you leave  like 3 in the afternoon  no I left at 4.30  oh you might as well  spend the night at the studio  I know  I should have  I got there 
[01:23:30]  and now  there wouldn't have been room  oh other people  are snoozing  well that's  I was going to continue  with my thing  but go ahead  oh  just trying to get out  of the city  because it's New York City  people work here  we're all aware of that  but it's also  a tourist attraction  and it's a winter wonderland  of Christmas shopping  yeah people  people look shopping  so everything's fucked up  they got gridlock everywhere  so they have these  these traffic people 
[01:24:00]  at every intersection  that are supposed to keep  the grid clear  the intersection clear  so that when the light  turns green for you  there's not a truck  in front of you  going you know  sideways  blocking the box  as they call it  that's their job  which if they did that  would be fine  out of nowhere  I'm trying to make  a right turn  onto 57th Street  all of a sudden  out of nowhere  this woman  dressed in her little  New York traffic thing  a lot of people 
[01:24:30]  mistake them for  police officers  and they try to  follow their rules  and give them the respect  that a police officer  deserves  no I don't  you are nothing  to me traffic people  nothing  she's standing there  and then all of a sudden  she goes  nope  she puts her hand up  and waves me forward  and says no  you continue  on 6th  you will not make  the right turn  on 57th  what was the reason  for that by the way  there is never  a reason Opie  there is never  a reason  I assume  they are thinking  57th is very busy 
[01:25:00]  did you turn  about a month ago  same thing happened  I didn't turn  I took her direction  went straight  I didn't see the bridge  for an hour  I didn't even see the bridge  to get off of fucking  Manhattan for an hour  because they send you  to a street  that is just  one lane  double parked cars  you never move  so she tells me no  and I just went  fuck you  I'm turning  and I turn my wheel  and I start going  she's yelling at me  she gets in front  of my car now 
[01:25:30]  she's on the  passenger side bumper  of my car  keeping me from going  and she's going to  come around  give me a little  talking to  and get my car  steered around  so I go straight  as she's doing this  a little red car  comes in  because it's two lanes  and cuts the right turn  so she sees this guy  pulling a little maneuver  turns around  and smacks the rear  quarter panel  of his car  as she does this  opens me up  I take off  we end up about  a block down 
[01:26:00]  at a light  together  we looked at each other  and we're both  laughing our ass up  we got each other  out of trouble  we both helped each other  out through that  little dilemma  hold on  hold on  I can't  I don't know quite  how that works  XM Satellite  exactly  we're going to be  on XM Satellite Radio  America's number one  satellite radio service  he said  sound like a pitch man  here  but we are going to be  on XM Satellite Radio  every morning  this broadcast  and it's already  the home of Snoop Dogg  and now it's going to be 
[01:26:30]  Snoop Dogg and Diane  that's the new  that's the new group  and Bob Dylan  and Charlie  well that's right  one of these things  is not like the other  doesn't quite fit  but we're delighted  to welcome the president  and CEO of XM Radio  Hugh Pinero  is here  oh look at our boss  he's on TV  nice to meet you  nice to see you  that's the big boss  you're going to let us  come on and just  steal your whole thing  right  we're going to replicate  all this festiveness  on radio  so basically  we're going to  have 6 million subscribers  by the end of the year 
[01:27:00]  we want to bring  XM Satellite Radio  to people all across  the country  and bring Good Morning America  to people all across  the country  I understand we're  on channel 155  yeah I'd say  why can't we be  on all the channels  well I'd like it  I'd like it to have  on all the channels  but it would just be  too festive right now  for everybody who says  I want to go to  satellite radio  you know that's hard  you can do it in your car  sort of  but can you carry it around  the people who don't know  what the access is  well basically  we have 150 channels  we have 70 commercial  free channels  we have lots of news  talking sports 
[01:27:30]  like Major League Baseball  we just signed Bob Dylan  so you do have  Dylan to Diane  and Charlie Parker  and Bobby Gibson  but basically  the service is great  and I think all those  people out here  would love to hear  Good Morning America  on their radio  because eventually  some people do have  to go to work  ONA  ONA Party Rock  we have 150 channels  and we're on channel 155  how does that work  we're off the spectrum  is that what you want  well basically  what we do is  we have a channel  that's dedicated to  women and  women lifestyles  it already features  people like 
[01:28:00]  Ellen DeGeneres  and Tyra Banks  and we can't think  of anyone else  that we want to be  a foundation of this  service than you two  well that's very nice  thank you  that's right  we'll be working up  a few musical numbers  I can sing like  Bob Dylan  but right now  Christmas is our  biggest time  in terms of people  getting XM Radio  and giving it as gifts  so giving the gift  of Good Morning America  to people  would just be fabulous  and opening  and  we'll see you on the radio  soon  let's go back to Robin 
[01:28:30]  she's got the news  alright Diana  yes we will see you  on the radio  there you go  there's the pitch  there's the big announcement  XM signed Good Morning America  for the woman's channel  that's pretty huge actually  oh they're going to be  on the woman's channel  yeah I guess that's 155 right  we should be on the woman's channel  what's wrong Patrice  I'm so glad I don't have to  put up with that horse shit  it's my last fucking  couple of days  on that  you motherfuckers  gotta play that shit 
[01:29:00]  wasn't that completely  like out of the realm  dibble dabble  doobble  it doesn't really  kapoople  honestly it doesn't concern  our listeners  for the most part  maybe a few  will take a peek  you know  but  but as far as  I'm sure  fucking trucker Dan  is going to take  a goddamn peek  but as far as the company  XM is just throwing  the variety all over the place  getting niches  I'm being serious  I don't have to  here's where that works  I'll tell you exactly  how that works  there's a mom  let's say  and she loves  Good Morning America 
[01:29:30]  watches it every morning  then she's got to  drive her kids  to school  right  so she misses  Good Morning America  while she's in the car  and this pisses her off  because she enjoys that show  now she's in there  boom  she gets to listen  to Good Morning America  her favorite show  here's the  here's the  the fallback on that  all right  oh boy  mother's in the car  listen to Good Morning America  yeah  daughter's in there  playing around  and they get right to 202  where Gangsta Fag is playing  well  and then  the mother realizes 
[01:30:00]  the Good Morning America people  call and say  listen  we can't have mistakes  we want to be at least  a thousand channels  away from  we want to be on channel  one thousand and six  because we heard  Gangster  they're fully aware  what they're getting  themselves into  holy shit  is there a different  satellite we can bounce  off of  we don't even want to  share a satellite  with Obi and Anthony  there's going to be  some old  fucking Buick  looking satellite  that we're going to  have to use  orbiting the earth 
[01:30:30]  just so no one else  has to share  our satellite  that's the beauty  of XM  there's something  for everyone  it's called variety  there's something  for everyone  that's what it is  and this is the  parental control channel  well they do the  channel blocking  which we don't like  to acknowledge  believe me  Good Morning America  won't accidentally  notice us  they know us  they know who we are  they know what we do  they've done stories  on us  we have disrupted  their broadcast  and it was very close  so for them to go  XM what's that  oh they know  what that is  and we came to a point 
[01:31:00]  where it was very close  that what you just saw  on TV  might not have happened  see  might never have  come to fruition  this is the beauty  of this very program  they'll get ready  to put two  in you motherfuckers  oh my god  they'll get ready  to pull a fucking  Joe Pesci  hey come on in  fellas  oh boy  that's the beauty  of this radio show  sometimes you think  they're never going to  get to the end  of that story  and why this had  to happen  and this happened  but there you go 
[01:31:30]  now it all makes sense  that was what caused  the furor  oh and a 202  no not anymore  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  they're gone  they're gone  they had to go  nothing we could do  there's nothing we could do  they had to go  and there's nothing  we could do about it  nothing we could do  that's why it all  went down last week  it was getting  very very scary  nothing we could do  I'm sorry  and that's how it happens  you're doing 
[01:32:00]  assault on the media  that affects the network  that fucks up  a 9 million dollar deal  and you have to go  that's what happened  I'm sorry  there was nothing  we could do about it  one's dead  one's dead  and one's sliced  they whacked him  they whacked him  they whacked him  it's fucking whacked him  it's fucking whacked him  does it all make sense now people 
[01:32:30]  does it all make sense  and Diane Sawyer's on the phone  and nothing we can do  nothing we can do  there's nothing we could do  I'll do my Bob Dylan impression  god damn fellas  thank you so much  for having me  on Fridays  and I don't have to deal  with that god damn shit  listen to god damn  Hugh on there  owning shit  oh I like to listen  in one of those meetings  that's what he does  that  see Patrice 
[01:33:00]  you don't understand  that's the corporate world  you don't understand  I fucking know  the world of the CEO  that's why I'm broke as fuck  because it's like  I don't even know  how to fucking pretend  did you see how he handled that  he got on  and every time  they went to him  where you would be compelled  probably to make a joke  maybe work the crowd  he made a point  of getting vital information  about XM Satellite Radio  out there to the people  six million  how many subs  where is it available 
[01:33:30]  it's Christmas  you should shop  get it  look what we got  variety  woman's channel  the guy  the info  bam bam  that's a CEO  XM had a great week  they signed Dylan  and now this good morning  and he's the man  that is the  that is  that's the Mac Daddy  the guy  and we look forward  to the day  that he actually  acknowledges us  on TV  one day  one day  it's gonna happen  that's big Paul  Castellano  that's Castellano  that's the guy  and Elo is  Elo's Gotti 
[01:34:00]  John Gotti  well he's Gotti  and Castellano  is Sammy  yeah  I mean  Elo Sammy  and that guy  we just saw  was Gotti  Gotti  yeah  that's pretty much it  that's the guy  who called me  last week  and all you heard  from me was  yes sir  yes sir  no sir  no sir  yes sir  yes I agree  yes sir  thank you sir  I'll take care of it sir  holy shit  goodbye sir  was it loud  those guys  don't yell  do they  oh  Nick River 
[01:34:30]  in the Lord  that's the deal  in my boy  I hope his eyes  got big  oh  yes sir  that's why you guys  just keep listening  to the program  everything makes sense  in the end  I'm sorry  ball  that was it  so people just  didn't know  why you motherfuckers  became slaves so fast  we got storylines  that are  a year  maybe two years old  that eventually  will make sense  in the end  it all just makes sense  is he a fan of the show  who you  yeah  let's go to the phones

[01:37:00]  we threw the audio  on because it  gives us content  for the show  too  we just got  a couple  chuckles  in  you know  and honestly  XM is just  a better company  and we like  to show why  by throwing  that up there  they signed  Dylan  and good  morning  America  they understand  the big picture  now would people  listening to this  program go  oh thank goodness  no  of course not  you go  who gives a shit  you go  fuck you  we understand  that  but  it's all about  variety folks  that's what it's about  it's not  it's not  let me

[01:40:00]  why aren't  you bleeding  because you're  not even  in hidden  puberty  yet  I couldn't  believe it  because you  had hair  in the arm  cellulite  what girl  12 years  old  has cellulite  I don't  understand  double standards  unbelievable  it's a double  standard  double standards  exist  and that's  what are you  going to do  about it  you're right  though  they would  never put  a guy  on there  explaining  how he  mistook  a 14  year old  girl  for 17  or 18  they lock  him up  throw away  the key  I am 
[01:40:30]  not going  to sit  in a room  with a  disgusting  man like  you  she use  FDS  they don't  start using  that shit  until they  like 30  are you  alright  the bitch  had her  own medicine  cabinet  she had  all the  problems  how can  she be  12  with good  credit  this bitch  gets to  explain  but here's  the other  side of  that  guys  don't  give a  fuck  I don't  we  fucking  your  37 year old  when I was  15  that's 
[01:41:00]  some  max  shit  for a  guy  that is  right  and you  can't go  you know what  you can't be  mad at her  because if you  go to the  boys  I got some  pussy  it was great  please don't  send her to  jail  I knew what  I was doing  and you know  it was again  because he told  a friend  or something  how'd she get  nailed  oh she got  pregnant  there's so many  of these  I don't even  know  there are  but it usually  turns out  that a friend  rats out  because these  kids  you gotta  tell someone  dude  you know  what I'm  doing  I'm  fucking  this  woman  you know 
[01:41:30]  and the  kid's  like  what  can I  get  some  no  alright  ratting  you  out  and the  kid  with that  one hair  just starting  puberty  runs home  the little  peach fuzz  mustache  that's just  over the  outside of  your lip  like the  corners of  your mouth  he's a  young  that mustache  he's a young  do-gooder  and he goes  right home  to mom  and says  this is what  I heard  in school  today  keep it  to yourself  the mother  calls up  a couple  of her  friends  and gets  advice  well you  have to  do the  right thing  and call  the police 
[01:42:00]  that's right  do you know  if you don't  call the police  and you know  about this  you can get  in trouble  I don't  want to see  women go to  jail for  getting young  dick  but I would  like to see  bitches go to  jail for  falsely accusing  motherfuckers of  rape  do you think  that happens  that much  that you  really need  to make  a  yes  does it  yes  really  yes  do you have  a story  I mean  I  yes  you really  have a story  but  but

[01:43:30]  testifying  it's like he's  on the fucking  stand  well I don't  recall  it happens  that's why  that's why  it's just like  everything  when I hear  Tyson  when I hear  Kobe  immediately I'm  on their  side  right  thinking of  the situation  analyzing what  happened  because to me  rape to me  let's all just  take a swig of  water  I need some  water too  I'm gonna  drink here  I'm getting  dry mouth  as well  oh boy  rape to me  is taking 
[01:44:00]  pussy  alright  I just don't  believe in  date  I don't  believe in  any  questionable  like  no  you think  rape is  pretty  it's a  cut and  dry thing  to me  there's no  there's just  to me  there's no  like  fucking  I don't  know  that's why  I know  so much  about  fucking  law  I look  up this  shit  all the  time  it's like  to you  it's waiting  in a corner  or in a  hallway  in an  apartment  building  grabbing her  and sticking  your dick  taking pussy  is rape  taking  pussy  is rape  now

[01:50:30]  he goes  she goes  rapey  and then she goes  uh oh  uh oh  and I got  raped in Boston  two weeks earlier  oh no  what  oh no  what  this is why  I love my mother  like I don't love  anybody else  I have no love  for anybody else  my mother found  this out  she came home  from where she was  and this is bad  karma 
[01:51:00]  cause she was at  a funeral  and I was doing  my shit  she comes on  what the fuck  is going on  here  cause she saw  something in the  laundry that wasn't  supposed to be  in the laundry  like sheets  or something  she's like  what the fuck  you doing  you know  I was not  at the age  where I'm  washing anything  yeah  I tell her the  story  my mother puts  me in the  trunk of a car  and sends me  out of town  in the actual  trunk  in the trunk  of a car  holy shit  and sends me  the fuck  out of town  until she can  figure this  fucking thing  out  they came  to my school 
[01:51:30]  looking for me  the cops  the cops  oh damn  they came  looking for me  to arrest me  at school  and arrest  everybody at school  and I was  gone already  my mother said  this is  you  when I told  it was a  white girl  she went  I was in  the trunk  of a car  heading to  a state  unknown  to hide  out from  this situation  so about  a month later  I came back  came back  to school  wow  and had to  go through  the process  holy  the process 
[01:52:00]  how'd you guys  get off  don't want to say  didn't get off  you didn't  didn't get off  what'd you get  charged for  I was 16  she was 15  did they  whittle it down  to something  it was not  whittled down  to anything  because they  said you  either plead  guilty  or you  go to  court  we decided  to go  to trial  but we  admitted  yeah  we fucked  him  but it's  16  15  and 
[01:52:30]  that's  statutory  that was  statutory  that's it  that's it  so  they're like  they're like  I'm good  time  how long  did you  you're good  time  how long  two months  two months  wow  two months  where  Walpole  no  they didn't  send me to  Walpole  no  they sent me  to  some youth  center  no  no  send two  punk at me  and one of my boys  you went to big boy prison  big boy  and my boy went crazy  he lost his mind 
[01:53:00]  because he was so scared  of getting raped  that he  didn't  he stopped washing up  he didn't take showers  and they started to  throw piss on him  started to beat him up  and they would come to me  and go yo  you know  you gotta tell your  motherfucking co-defendant  get his shit right  how about I tell myself  what myself has to do  and I don't give a fuck  and I was so scared  because of the stories  you hear about that situation  but it was a guy  who ran the prison  it was these five guys  who ran the prison  these inmates  and they were  they were named after 
[01:53:30]  southern states  like South Carolina  with Carolina  get the fuck  this is so scary  it was like Carolina  I'm freaking out  yeah  this is the first time  I've ever talked about this  oh my god  see this is what happens  with this radio show  you run out of shit  to talk about  you go well  I guess I can tell a story  I've never told before  and you run out of funny  all of a sudden  I'm choking back  like this is like  dude  I'm gonna tell you  this is the  I've never  this is it  like this is either  the end of my career  kind of thing  or  no 
[01:54:00]  people don't  and I realize this  because  it's like people don't  but  all the shit that goes on  out here  here's where I kind of  felt comfortable  in terms of this  those five guys  and  it was an overcrowded place  on this  this prison  and  I used to hear all day long  there was this one other guy  that they'd go  that motherfucker  he was in there  for scolding his kid  this one kid guy  was in the scolding  his kid in the bathtub  and he's  that baby burning  motherfucker  you know 
[01:54:30]  we ought to fuck it  you know  we ought to kill that  motherfucker  that baby burner  over here talking to me  he said hi to the guy  who  one of the  one of the southern state guys  who was on death row  this is back when  Current Affair  when Bill Riley  was on Current Affair  this was a guy  who was on death row  in the state  that he was named after  I can't  I don't want to say  his fucking state  but I know  one of them's not  South Carolina  so that's why I said  but any of those  fucking states down there  so  he was on death row 
[01:55:00]  I'm so all over the place  because you don't understand  man  you got the emotion  it's like  even the story  is deeper  you know  it's just  it's just so fucking  you know  to me  you know what I mean  so I'm in jail  we're corny  I'm a corny dude  I'm a comic  I was born a comic  you know  and I'm a corny  fucking guy  you know what I'm saying  grew up in a gangster area  but I used to make  those guys laugh  you know what I'm saying 
[01:55:30]  so  you know  so I was in there  because it was a real  it was a gangster  whose name  I'm not going to say either  but  what they did  was they  the guy goes  it was a judge  who  was  known for being lenient  and  he  this is why I learned this thing  because he read a book  he's like  these guys didn't  these guys didn't fucking  do this 
[01:56:00]  you know  he didn't force  and the bitch was in court  going  and then  they fucking did this  and then they did that  and I'm sitting there writing  and he was just  the judge was like  saying  I'm very impressed with  this  I know this is bullshit  but  this is Boston  and they just wrote  something about him  or how he's too lenient  on shit  oh no  so  at the time  I think the DA was Maloney  or something  some you know  Mick  you know  and so  they ended up going  we're gonna  this is what they did 
[01:56:30]  sentenced us in February  to the summer  this is what he said  this is just to teach you guys  that  you know  that sex is not all about  this  stuff that you're doing  we're gonna sentence you  during the time of love  we're gonna sentence you  during the time of love  summertime  just so you know why  your  other people are  cultivating their relationships  while girls are jacking off 
[01:57:00]  with guys  and sucking their cocks  you'll be in here  you'll be inside of here  as a lesson  kind of thing  and my friend  lost his fucking mind  he's  he's officially  schizophrenic  he's not really  because of this  he was so afraid  now what happened is  I used to be so funny  in there  that  this dude  one of the state guys  and I would hear him  talking about how  he's gonna fuck up  this baby burner  right  and the fear  came from this other  gangster  where he said  cause no one 
[01:57:30]  was like  ah you fucking rapist  they was all like  you get raped man  get the fuck out of here  so he goes  man you gonna have trouble  this is gangsta outside  you gonna have trouble man  oh shit  you going in for a skin beef  they call it skinning  you got a skin beef nigga  you fucked up  oh my  this is fucked up  oh shit  you know  so I'm going in  and I'm choking back tears  like a motherfucker  you know  yeah  and finally  the  the five  they  they used to walk around 
[01:58:00]  the yard  just five of these motherfuckers  it was really like a movie  slowly walk around the yard  they go  yo  big man  yo fat man  come here man  man we can talk to you  but they were like country  come here fat man  I go what's up  man what the fuck  you in here for  oh shit  I'm walking with him  I'm telling him the story  holy crap  and I'm sitting here like this  cause they  cause why they called me was  why the fuck  is your  co-defendant  not taking showers 
[01:58:30]  yeah  why is he not taking showers  he's fucking stinking man  somebody gonna kill him  oh my god  yeah  they used to throw piss on him  he used to wear  three pairs of jeans  never took his shoes off  just cause it would be harder  to get three pairs of jeans off  just cause it would be hard  to get raped  so I tell him the story  and I'm just going  I'm gonna have to fight  I'm gonna have to do something  this is gonna be fucked up  finally they  I told him the story  and I'm just  the drum roll  the  the stabbing drum roll  where's the payoff now 
[01:59:00]  they go  what  you in here for that shit  pulling a train  nigga  everybody in this  motherfucker did that  and you in jail for it  oh shit  did you ever let me see you  in here again  so they just took to me  so I would walk with them  every morning  they just  took to me  in case  somebody just said  fuck it  you in there on the skim beef  but nobody ever  fucked with me  cause it was such  bullshit  it was just such  not  it was just bullshit  dude  it was like  it was like the worst thing 
[01:59:30]  and the only thing  I think of is  I could've  I could've  been in there forever  on some shit like that  in Boston  I know motherfuckers  that went  for a long time  they put us in there  for like two months  because we go  yeah we fucked her  but  it's like that's all  cause obviously  it was so obviously  bullshit  that they couldn't  put you in there  any longer  that they couldn't  just destroy lives  which they did  destroy lives  cause I bumped into  a couple of other guys  one guy ran  and they never caught him  but he came back 
[02:00:00]  cause it's  statute of limitations  but another kid  it changed his life too  it just makes you  one guy ran  until the statute ran out  yeah  ran until they stopped  looking for him  and he said fuck it  you know  I ain't  nah  fuck it  you know  and I didn't run  cause I thought  well I did run  my mother made me run  cause she just knew  she had an insight  that I didn't have  she's like you know  you can't be doing  yeah you're probably  just like what  yeah why  just some pussy  but it's like  the person  I'm not even mad at her  because that's why  it's like the Kobe shit 
[02:00:30]  happened  and I say immediately  black guys are the most  wanted to be fucked guys  in the world  but can't be fucked  they're not allowed  women are not allowed  to fuck black guys  on any level  meaning in an open way  so it's like  when I heard that Kobe shit  I'm like I know what happened  you know what I'm saying  whatever happened  Kobe didn't take no pussy  but I can't be mad at her  because  this is a white bitch  from Colorado  who was not  prepared  to fuck a black guy  she's not raised 
[02:01:00]  to fuck a black guy  you understand  so I know what happened  it was just like  he didn't do  the proper thing  you know what I mean  he was probably  treated like shit  and she just goes  and she's walking around  her pussy hurts  you know  and she goes  I got legs  and it's just that easy  and I'm a fucking  giant nigga  in Boston  talking  if this girl  had been  like  the fucking mayor  like I said  the mayor's daughter  she had been  some white girl  who was out there  doing George Bush 
[02:01:30]  daughter shit  and it came out  that she gave  all these niggas  some pussy  you wouldn't know me  you wouldn't know me  you know  holy shit  so that's why I go  you know  when motherfuckers say  rape  now these niggas  that's out here  killing these little girls  that's a whole  another story  but when you get  some motherfucking  talking about  you know  some old  fucking  you know  and then I  I said no  and no means  no  and blasey 
[02:02:00]  I fuck my girl  let me tell you  my girl's a fucking  maniac  man  like she goes  hit me  and this and that  and it took me a long time  to be able to even  have  enjoy sex  man  on that level  because  it's just  it's just  I go  you think  you think  you think  you're the consequences  of  yeah  you start  thinking a few steps  ahead of yourself  what if I  what if  you know  look at one of these  bitches on your wall  you know  these  these  agliaro bitches  and I fuck them  and then  she give me pussy  and then say  you know  you rape me  I would 
[02:02:30]  I would believe  I did  because I'm like  you would  I wouldn't give me pussy  if I was you  but she did  you know what I mean  so that whole thing  you know  it just  it changed my  my entire  a lot of my jokes  the Pepsi Cola rapist  a lot of the Tyson shit  I do  all of that  it changed my life  because I just had  this mistrust  for pussy  man  it's not an anger  it's just a mistrust  because you can  it's so easy  it's  I guess that's the payoff  if you can be raped 
[02:03:00]  then  you must  you have to have  a natural  mechanism  to stop  that from happening  which is  I guess it's a  a trade off  okay  I'm gonna say  you rape me  that's the power  that a woman has  I'm gonna just say  you did  as opposed to  you doing it  this guy actually  raped you  but I'm gonna say  that motherfucker  you know  so that's why  when a bitch  10 years later  they say some  fucking janitor  took some pussy  some black janitor  and then 15 years later 
[02:03:30]  she goes  I was lying  yeah  and he gets out  and he gives the speech  of I found  I'm just happy to be  one of our family  and I'm like  man if I did 15 years  it's like  and they find out  that the joggers  the Central Park  jogger kids  didn't do it  I would make a speech  like look  because after  3 weeks  I was a soft kid  like meaning  I was a clown  after 3 weeks  you  you learn  you 
[02:04:00]  you're in prison  yeah  and I'm not afraid  no more  and you learn  how to  motivate  you learn  how to navigate  you learn  how to  you don't take stuff  the one bit of advice  that somebody told me  right when I went in  that kept me  very very safe  is don't accept  anything from anyone  if you need something  you go without  yeah  don't say  hey man  you're hungry  if you're hungry  eat your fingers  don't  because motherfuckers  go here's a Snickers bar  and then they want  their Snickers bar 
[02:04:30]  and a Milky Way  tomorrow  yeah  and it was this guy  in there  and I was going to  get into beef  because I had to  and you just  learn the rules  of that shit  and there was  this dude  who had a woman's name  Shirley  you know  and what Shirley  used to do  is give people  new people food  and then  the next day  say I want my food back  and if they didn't  Shirley would knock you out  and rape you  so one day 
[02:05:00]  I'm in the fucking shower  oh no  so Shirley says to me  mmm  oh that's what they call me  heavy D  in there  mmm  heavy D  looking good  one of the  fucking  southern state  motherfuckers goes  damn boy  you can't let that  happen man  oh no  you can't let that  happen  was he a big dude  Shirley  he was my size  oh damn  so he goes  you can't let that 
[02:05:30]  happen man  he's telling you  you can't let that  happen  so that day  I had put on  I never wore  the garb  the prison garb  but that day  I put the prison garb on  the blue shirt  up to my neck  fucking tucked it in  and motherfucking gave me  the top  of a  soup can lid  bent up  oh shit  I met  I met Shirley  outside the lunchroom  after that  and hemmed him up 
[02:06:00]  and that motherfucker  said I was playing  I'm sorry  he got faggy  wow  and I  another  fucking  hail mary  like thank you  I didn't have to really  cause he was just scared  of another guy  his size  who was  mad  yeah  and he just said  you know  I said you gonna have to  fucking apologize to me  in front of everybody  for saying  you have to say  you was joking  he said oh man  you know  I would never bother  if he's a nice guy  da da da da da da  alright  so I didn't have to  do anything 
[02:06:30]  holy shit  I've known you for years  this is such a journey  into a world  I have no clue  about  I'm just sitting back  and listening  like I've never  listened before  oh  man  I'm really  on some  I see it in your eyes bro  I see it in your eyes  you're ready to like  almost break down  dude it's great  I mean the fucking  you know  and the reason I don't  because I'm in this business  it's history  it's a lot of fear  it's a lot of fear  yeah  my career  a lot of people have questions  but Bill in New Jersey 
[02:07:00]  has a pretty good question  Bill  yeah  Patrice  I was wondering  what happened  with the baby burner  yeah we all want to know  what happened  with the baby burner  I don't know  I don't remember  the baby burner  but why I was concerned  about the baby  is because  it was relating to me  it was just like  I was like  is that  is my thing  is related  to this baby burner  that they wanted to kill  right  now you realize  this is why  I'm very easy going  in life  a lot of stuff  I learned  I learned from there  that two months 
[02:07:30]  of being there  it's like  there was going to be  a fight one day  because this guy  was in there  for 25 years  the place I was  was called  an assessment center  so they would send  guys like me there  and guys  who were going  to death row  there  to assess you  for what you did  and where you would go  okay  you're going to stay here  and do all your time here  are you going to go  to Walpole  see the junction  Walpole  which is  the baddest prison  on the east coast 
[02:08:00]  of the half of this country  Walpole  has the highest murder  murder rate going  I saw a documentary  on that  it's a dangerous place  and wow  and they weren't sending us there  we were going to do the whole time  in this place  but it's like the  like you said  the Star Wars place  is like where people go  to go other places  before they go somewhere else  so this motherfucker  one day  he  he stopped everything  because everybody was like  yeah man  you know  I got six months  yeah man  I'm out of here 
[02:08:30]  in three months  and he  he turned the table over  and said  the next  I'm doing  25 motherfucking years  the next nigga  who say  he's doing  less than that  I'm a motherfucking  killer  oh  I'm scared  yeah  so  the baby burner  it could have been  a year plan  uh huh  because the motherfuckers  I was talking to  the guys that took  kind of  who took a 
[02:09:00]  a liking to me  they were in there  for years  yeah  so if they decide  to kill you  they kill you  they kill you  on their time  just kill them in February  yeah we got plenty of time  you know  so I don't know  what happened  what happened to the guy  that uh  that made the chick  suck his dick  and that she originally said  yeah the  rape and then  fuck  he  he got off  like we should've  cause he had his trial  in Stoughton  this bitch was doing 
[02:09:30]  transcontinental rape cases  and shit  I'm in Boston  he's had a black judge  who let him go  with like  the shit that should've happened  like bitch  get out of here  gave him like probation  just cause it is  what it is  and even though she's a hoe  that was more  coerced sex  than what you guys did  yes  coerced  hey man  I heard what you did  and she  after  she sucked his dick  she lost it 
[02:10:00]  which I can't blame  I mean  that's a lot of pressure  on a bitch  I can't  that's the type of shit  you go  oh my god  I can't be  like sucking  black male dick sucking  for the rest of my fucking life  black male in two ways  you know what I'm saying  I can't suck black dick  and black male dick  and black male  you know what I mean  and you know  you can't blame  she wants to do it  on her terms  if she wants to get in a car  with a bunch of guys  and suck some dick  that's on her terms  the reason  being that 
[02:10:30]  that guy  then comes up to her  and makes her do it  she fucking snapped  she lost it  and I can't be mad at her  for that  the only thing  I'm bitter about  is that it just  you know  it tarnished my mind  you know what I mean  it tarnished my mind  you know  I just not  I'm not ever safe in my head  like it's kind of  I want to cry right now  because  it really is a release  it's almost like  alright you know what  please don't cry  nah  I've never hugged anyone  nah  as big as you 
[02:11:00]  it's not there anymore  like it's not  it's just what it is  the emotion is  is actually  and what would you do  if you started crying right now  you know what I'm saying  what I would leave the studio  you would just  I would just  I think I would be the guy  that would have to go up to you  believe it or not  this is the first time  my screensavers ever came up  on the instant feedback  because I haven't even looked at it  no I'm just  I have not fucking looked at it  I've been amazed  because I've known Patrice for many years  this has never come out  I think  fuck Patrice  anybody that's been in this studio  I've never heard  yeah yeah 
[02:11:30]  this is one of the most unbelievable stories  we've heard  and like  and I think  I would have to be the guy  that would have to go over  and I think I might have to hug him  oh you  you would hug him  I would have to be the guy  that would have to like hug you  and you're like twice  all my hugging  call yourself like Arizona  go over there and give him a hug  you know  the emotional part is  my prison name would be  Connecticut  you know  because I would rather do this  but I was hoping to be successful  before I had to ever talk about it  before you ever had to  like  because the fear is like 
[02:12:00]  wow man  my career is like  man  it's a bad  stigma  and it's like  you know  I don't take  you know  I got bitches all over the world  that'll go  nah  not even close to that  did all that crazy shit  Richard Pryor did  it didn't  you know  you know  it's like  you know  people  oh he's this  and nah  it's like nah  you know  that's fuel  for motherfuckers  who don't like me  it's like  that's cool  but I made it through  like I wouldn't even break down  because I made it through  high school  you know  and that shit stopped  did you make friends 
[02:12:30]  with a mouse  I had a roach  I had a fly  that used to come in  and see  you know the photoshop's  gonna go nuts  with you and the green mile  I'm sorry  in advance I'm sorry  but you might want to  check out whack bag tonight  under the photoshop  none of these fucking  psychos man  and don't worry about  you know  talking about it  before you know  your career is where  you wouldn't have liked  I didn't want it to come  I didn't want it to ever  pop up  according to  against my shit  you know  against  I'll tell it  you know  yeah but according to  USA Today  we're pretty much

That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon? 
[02:17:30]  Ramon, call 911.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  We like to call this a virus, the ONA virus.  If you like what you're hearing, tell a friend. 
[02:18:00]  After that story, my voice is going to sound like this every time I try to make a joke.  Riveting.  I'm not trying to take pussy clothes.  Absolutely riveting.  We got Lazlo in studio.  Tell your chick that story.  She knows that shit?  Yeah, I tell every bitch.  I tell every bitch.  That's going to help.  I just tell them.  I just say, yo, this is what happens. 
[02:18:30]  You should just put it in an email or on a piece of paper, a flyer that you can just give out.  Put them on the windshield wipers at the clubs.  Or on a contract.  I had a bitch that was a lawyer.  I was going out when I told her.  Really?  See?  That's what it was.  Black men.  That's what it had.  You fucked them white girls.  And look what the fuck.  She didn't go, ah!  She just went, ah!  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Dummy.  Unbelievable.  All right, Lazlo, what do we got going on today?  Lazlo in studio.  You guys are going to be at CES? 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  Yes.  We're going to Vegas.  Yeah.  You going to be there?  Sure, man.  Of course, he goes every year, too.  You got the Howard Hughes sweet old books?  Yeah, hopefully.  Do we have the same sweetest luxury?  Do we have the same goddamn hotel?  Because I know they usually book well in advance.  And then when we try to book, we end up at some place in the old.  You're going to love the quaint old strip, they used to call it.  When you go to Vegas, you see the new strip?  You don't want to stay there.  You want the old Vegas atmosphere, like when the Rat Pack used to be a penny slot machine.  Yeah, that's what I want.  No, I want Bellagio. 
[02:19:30]  My buddy.  I want big places.  MGM Grand, big places.  You know the guys that stand on the corners and hand out those magazines that have all  the different chicks you can pick from?  Well, they're like baseball cards.  Well, that, and they've got the full magazines.  Yep.  A buddy of mine was getting some audio for my show, standing out on the sidewalk with  a mini disc, and security bum-rushed him and took his mini disc player.  Why?  They said, well, they don't want to promote the fact that, you know, people were handing  out catalogs full of bitches with prices on them that say $69.99 and $79.99. 
[02:20:00]  Took his equipment.  Yeah.  He could end up in a hole in the desert.  Trying to go with that family-friendly shit out there.  Yeah.  Yeah, good luck with that.  They can't decide.  Actually, I think they're going to succeed because they did that to Times Square here in  New York.  They were Disney-ing up Vegas for a while, but it's starting to, I think that reached  its peak, and it's starting to come back a little bit where it's a little more adult-oriented  and they're putting the emphasis on that.  I think they're thinking if they get family-friendly, they're going to get a lot more business, though. 
[02:20:30]  But they were, and they did.  But I think that it's just the beginning.  I really do.  Like Wynn's Place.  Fucking giant.  Yeah, we've got to check that out.  That place is massive.  Yeah, Todd in Missouri.  That's no, like, kid place.  Good morning, boy.  I'm just distracted, Ann.  I'm sorry.  Todd, go ahead.  I'm Anthony Acumia's friend on MySpace, and I'm on the radio.  All right.  What's up, Todd?  Hey, I want to know, who the hell made that new promo for the Wow stickers, and how come 
[02:21:00]  you guys haven't called him out on it?  That thing stinks.  I didn't hear it.  All right, let me tell you what happens.  When we go to break, we run and do all sorts of stuff.  We check with Ben.  We go to the bathroom.  We get more food.  We get coffee from the Starbucks machine.  When I listen to the replay, I'm absolutely amazed what's being played when we're not  live.  I hear 16 Gamma-O spots in a row.  Gamma-O.  Gamma-O.  We get it.  Gamma-O.  And then I hear promos, and I'm like, wow, we're playing this?  All right.  With the experience of a man. 
[02:21:30]  That headline kills me.  I know.  I say it the same way every time, don't I?  Every 800 times in a place of a man.  I got who did that, and take them out and shoot them.  What's the Wow promo?  I guess we've got to play it now.  It's a new one with Toby.  Toby?  Who's Toby?  That's what I say.  Sam's Toby?  Hawk, you know anything about this?  Of course not.  Sit down and shut up.  Who wrote this?  Steve wrote this?  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Let's hear the new Wow promo.  The following is a simple guide to getting your very own Wow sticker from the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:22:00]  O-N-A party rock.  That's right, Toby.  O-N-A party rock indeed.  Boy, I love them.  Head over to opieandanthony.com and click on the Wow sticker button.  Sometimes I pick my nose with a coat hanger.  That's nice.  You keep doing that.  It's all sticky.  Or send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Attention Wow stickers, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  Gosh, that was easy.  It sure was, Toby.  Now put that Wow sticker somewhere obvious.  Put it on my eyebrows.  Now, now, Toby. 
[02:22:30]  I wouldn't do that if I were you.  Adios, eyebrows.  And finally, enjoy Blizzoms.  One time I walked in on my grandma in the shower.  I saw her boobs.  I cried a lot.  Is there a delete button?  Like, because I know if I have a file on my home computer, I can drag it into the trash and then hit delete.  Is there something like that on Dilette that can be used for that?  Yeah, then reformat the hard drive when you're done.  Yeah, please.  And then throw it away.  Take a big magnet that they used to pick up cars and put them into one of those crushers and put it over that hard drive. 
[02:23:00]  Oh!  Who produced that?  Who produced it?  Who voiced it?  Steve?  Everyone is fired.  Danny?  Danny was involved in that.  I know that voice.  Yes, I was involved.  However, I did not write any part of that guy.  You're like rich little talent.  That fucking voice.  Little's better than none.  Well, his voice is fine.  Sam was on the line, also known as Toby. 
[02:23:30]  Hi, Sam.  Was that Sam?  Sam.  Yeah.  Do the voice.  Do the voice.  Bye.  No.  Adios, eyebrows.  Do, say bye-bye, eyebrows, or whatever you said.  Adios, eyebrows.  Oh, my God.  Okay, I never want to hear from Sam again.  No, his name's Toby.  Oh, Toby.  That was the worst bit of production I've ever heard.  Ever.  Steve's experimenting with new characters.  Steve, he came up with Ramon, and I think he's been feeling the pressure to come up with a new character. 
[02:24:00]  He came up with Toby.  I know Ramon.  That was no Ramon.  That was drivel.  You're killing Sam, though.  It wasn't funny.  The voice was completely annoying.  Sam's fast-forwarding, going, man, I'm going to have at least ten of these as this character.  No, that will never air again, Sam.  Well, you know.  How many Tobys did you record?  I only recorded the one.  Oh, just the one.  We recorded the first one that was just the Toby character, and then you said that was annoying and we were going to try it again. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  Do you use that voice on Scorch's show?  No, no.  That was actually not my creation, the voice.  See?  No, it's your creation.  It came from you.  That was not my creation.  Sam and Militia would beat you up.  Sam, you're doing a voice?  Oh.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, so.  Adios.  Thumbs down on the new character.  Thumbs way down. 
[02:25:00]  Steve is nowhere to be seen.  Steve ran.  Tell between legs.  Charlie's picking up on something.  Charlie, go ahead.  This is Charlie.  I did a weekend in Burton County.  I want to send some love out to Patrice, and I'd like you guys to play the Cranberries for him,  because I know that's his favorite song.  Yeah, which one is your favorite again?  A zombie.  A bunch of evil bastards.  There we go.  Patrice is back, everybody.

[02:31:00]  oh we miss Bruce  I think the whole  construction work  I'm waiting  alright  Laszlo  so what did you  bring in today  CES  what's going to be  some of the big  things that we're  going to be looking  for over there  well you guys are  going to be broadcasting  live I'm assuming  hells yeah  yeah they give us  like two hours  it's the easiest  gig in the world  listen to this gig  we broadcast  we don't even have  to get up early  because of the time  difference right  right  so what time  do we start  I don't know  11 or something  it's like 11 o'clock  we do two hours  and we hang out  in the casino  we're going to do  we're going to do  two two hour shows 
[02:31:30]  we're taking a day  off to fly out  to Vegas  and then we're  taking two days  off afterwards  yeah I'm spending  the whole weekend  there  so we're doing  the show  and it's not even  vacation time  it's just what  they want us to do  can you curse up  on stage  because I remember  there were some  issues  last time  about whether  you could curse  and  what on  oh because we had  the speakers  going out  over to the live  there was like  kind of a live  audience in the  display  in the XM display  and we were  broadcasting there 
[02:32:00]  so they were  a little iffy  but we were new  we were pretty new  at that point  we didn't want  to shock anybody  I think if  I don't know  the reality is  we got to play  their game for two  days that's all  we understand that  yeah  you guys ought to  check out the  home theater section  over there  I missed that last  year because it  was I think  20 miles  yeah  down the  it's the biggest  I've never seen  a bigger convention  center  ever  in my life  it is shit  and now it's  it's actually  gone to two  convention centers  it's like the  old days of  Comdex  because they've  run out of  space  what do you  got to shuttle 
[02:32:30]  over to  the sands  they're going  to have some  boots over there  I hope the  awful stuff is  there because  I really don't  want to go  over to the  sands  but you know  like every day  I'm getting  all these press  releases  come check this  out  you know  there's like  a demo for  7.1  discrete channels  of high audio  DTS HD  surround sound  what's that  going to do  for me  I have no  idea  I got two  ears  7.1  and they have  these chairs  now  $6,000 recliners  that have like  subwoofers  access points  so while you're  watching things  like the chairs 
[02:33:00]  rocking back and  forth  so what you feel  like you're  kind of in the  like you're in  the movie  it's also for  gaming as well  there's a lot  of gaming furniture  not bad  yeah but $6,000  it's a little  much recliner  dude  it better have a  fridge in it  I'd rather give you  have a great  surround sound  system  it's got to be  pretty heavy  no I'm just  trying to figure  out if Club  Soda Kenny  can bring it  over to your  house  carry it home  for me  from Vegas  I'm on the  plane  it's like in  his lap  on the plane  you stink  oh man  you know  the weirdest 
[02:33:30]  press release  I've gotten  so far  do you remember  Commodore  Commodore 64  that was my  first  no my second  I had an  Atari 800  first and then  I got the  Commodore 64  the company's  back and  they're trying  to make a  big splash  in what  industry  they're selling  like MP3  players  media boxes  what have  they been  doing  I don't know  hopefully they  change their  name to  Microsoft  I don't think  Commodore is  going to  and just spell  it with a K  instead or  something  make a splash  because that's 
[02:34:00]  the biggest  problem  you've got to  change the  name  because as soon  you hear  Commodore  you're like  are they putting  out huge  plastic cartridges  that don't fit  in anything  you just  plug this  in  it's an MP3  player  that's 20  years old  it plays  one song  hold on a  second there  John in Jersey  John  oh my god  I gotta tell  you I'm driving  to work  big fan by the way  40 hours of you  on my iPod  57 year old  business executive  oh cool thanks  I'm driving to work  and I'm listening  to Patrice's story  I go right  through a red light  holy shit  and there's this  18 wheeler  who stops  at my door 
[02:34:30]  just almost  hits me  oh my god  I was completely  miserable  killing motherfuckers  it's like a  20 pile car  20 car pile up  somewhere  and all they're  all here  is the cranberries  that's the police  on the scene  taking police reports  there's fire  and people screaming  everybody reliving  pussy hostage days  baby  and I was one of  my brothers  that got beheaded  yeah you were there  with the  pussy hostage 
[02:35:00]  Al Qaeda  I almost got  nailed because  of your story  yeah  alright Laszlo  sorry I couldn't  let that  the HD radio  alliance is going  to be there  big and strong  yeah now this  is something  I'm in fucking  radio right  at least I think  I am  I have no clue  about high  definition radio  people in the  radio business  and the radio  broadcast radio  side of it  are trying to  present it like  it's a major  competition for  satellite radio  what the fuck 
[02:35:30]  is high  definition radio  well they're  making all the  terrestrial radio  stations switch  to new equipment  so they're  broadcasting  instead of an  analog they're  sending out a  digital signal  a digital signal  so now you have  to get new radios  to pick up that  signal  right you won't  you can't pick up  high definition HD  radio on your  regular radio in your  car  so you got to buy  a new radio  which at that point  you might as well  just get a satellite  radio  exactly  there's already  stations that are  hinting and talking  about charging 
[02:36:00]  subscription fees  great  but you can only  get the station  around the city  they're basically  right it's not like  a satellite where  you can go coast  to coast  it's still just  limited to the  transmitter  they're basically  starting up  satellite radio  like  but it's  terrestrial  based  years and years  before  and since it  is broadcast  it still  falls within  FCC guidelines  yeah but there's  been some  discussions about  whether if it's  subscription based  if they do have  a subscription  based channel  yeah but again  why would you  subscribe to  something that  you're in a 
[02:36:30]  radius of a  broadcast tower  and the record  companies are  all up in arms  about HD radio  because they  can see the  consumer electronics  companies are  going to make  radios that will  just grab songs  digital signal  save it to a  hard drive  I don't even  have to listen  at a station  anymore  I can just  tell you know  my unit to  record a bunch  of songs to  the hard drive  so why am I  going to go buy  the albums  so they're trying  to get legislation  rammed through  that you can  only record  30 minutes worth  of content  on an HD radio  so it's like 
[02:37:00]  the technology's  going to be  legislated and  dead before  anybody even  gives a shit  if CBS wasn't  on record  like if you  got basic  cable  and CBS  wasn't on it  you would not  pay to have  CBS  you would never  pay for CBS  no you just live  without it  you would just  live without it  yeah you wouldn't  pay for shit  that was free  no there's nothing  okay I got HBO  I was supposed to  pay for that  because they came  in with that shit  but CBS  right  I'm not  fuck you  if it's not  coming with it  then I'm not  going to get it  extra  yeah  that's why  XM is light  years ahead of 
[02:37:30]  this whole thing  because it's all  about content  now what about  this I'm hearing  different streams  on HD  yeah  can there be  like let's say  we'll take a  station WNEW  here in New York  let's say they're  HD  they go HD  what is this  you can get  three separate  stations let's  say out of  one station  and this is  exactly what  happened with  HD television  they were like  oh we're going  to be sending  out these huge  beautiful pictures  and signals  and then like  wow we could  split our signal 
[02:38:00]  into four different  stations  yeah and defeat  the purpose of  having all that  information being  sent down the  pipeline into  one big beautiful  picture  now you can  make more money  by splitting  into four  and what's  hysterical about  HD is  crap  that they just  did a survey  Scientific  Atlanta did a  survey and  people who have  HD TV sets  think they're  watching high  definition television  but they're  not  they think  oh I've got  the set  so of course  I'm watching  HD  you have to  get a box  you need a  high definition  box or else 
[02:38:30]  your HD TV  isn't any  better than  the regular  resolution  it's a disaster  it's going to  take years  Ope's got his  high def now  you've got to  go get the  box dude  and then you've  got to sign up  for high definition  channels  I've got to find out  what Kenny's doing  it's going to cost you  a little more on your  cable bill by the way  my cable bill is  close to $300 a month  I think  I remember when my  cable bill was like  cable bill is beyond  ridiculous  what is your girl  doing at home  during the day  what  you buy pay-per-view  you get a couple  of pay-per-views a  month or a couple  of movies on demand 
[02:39:00]  and before you know  it yeah you're over  200 bucks  I'm telling you  but on demand is  free really now  they have the free  on demand and then  they have the movies  on demand like you  pay for like 4 bucks  or 5 bucks and it's  movies that kind of  just got out of the  movie theater and  then there's HBO  on demand Showtime  Cinema which  Cinemax on demand  is the worst  bunch of  you go through like  HBO is  great  HBO on demand  is amazing  Showtime is okay  Stars is good too  Stars is good  on demand  Stars on demand  is good  Cinemax 
[02:39:30]  I go there  it's like 5 movies  it's like the  you know  fucking  the gigolo movie  with Rob Schneider  and something else  it's just the  awful movies on that  they're now talking  about a la carte  cable pricing  yes  have you heard  about this controversy  yes people are  outraged  as far as some of  these politicians  go  people are outraged  I haven't seen  one outraged  person but  they're outraged  that they have to  pay for a lot of  these channels that  they're not using  but the cable company 
[02:40:00]  offers you what are  packages  so you can't just say  I want HBO  I want this  and I want my  basic cable channels  they say no  well you gotta  take the platinum  package or the gold  package or something  they want to be able  to hand pick  every channel  and it's also part  of the whole decency  thing  because the lawmakers  are saying  it'll give parents  a lot more control  over which channels  you can have  there's already  three layers of  controls that  parents have  so they're now  trying to  like Ted Stevens  from Alaska  why he's always 
[02:40:30]  at the forefront  what the fuck  you got going on  up in Alaska  that you gotta  tell the lower 48  how to live  baby seal clubbing  take care of that  first pally  you know what's  bizarre about  the a la carte thing  is that people  who are upset  about it  televangelists  are afraid  that if cable  goes that direction  they won't be  on you know  every in every  household in America  brilliant  right the people  that should morally  be so behind this  are against it  because who the  fuck is gonna say  I want the 
[02:41:00]  PTL club channel  I want the one  where the religious  guy is preaching  24 hours a day  well the concept  of the channel  is outdated  I mean you know  you and I have  talked about  several times  you just record  an entire series  and sit through  a marathon  you know  we're just  talking about  on demand  the concept  of actually  sitting down  and watching  television  as per their  schedule  I'm in a hotel  room  you know  and I turn on  I turn on the TV  and I'm hitting  fucking buttons  on there  I'm like  no skip  stop  you know  like I've got  no control 
[02:41:30]  over the television  I'm ready to  smash the thing  I go right to  movies  in the hotel  I don't watch  like regular  television  and now  the movies  in the hotels  you got the  pause  stop  so you get  some room  service  you can pause  it  like that's  the whole thing  and at home  it's the same  thing  I don't watch  television as  it's happening  I have the  cable box  it records it  DVR  DVR is amazing  and you  you gotta take a  piss  you pause it  you wanna see  something again  you go  did that  motherfucker  just say that  you rewind  you go  ah baby  come in here  look at this 
[02:42:00]  you gotta see this  there was  something  a fear factor  was on  the other day  and we're watching it  and it was  blind date  fear factor  hysterical  they hooked up  this hillbilly  hick motherfucker  who had like  half a foot  no teeth  with this  hot little  fucking  chick  this little  blonde  who was just  like  adorable  and  my girlfriend  paused it  and was just  like  you gotta  come in here  and I was  doing something  so I couldn't  come right in  but you just  have it paused  for a few 
[02:42:30]  and this is  what fucking  television is  in this  century  it's not  sitting there  at their  mercy  watching that  crap  there's gonna  be two  new phones  at CES  that actually  record  television  phones  so it'll be  like a TiVo  in your phone  for your phone  that's great  yeah  I'm kinda  getting into  the phone  TV thing  yeah the phones  are starting  to figure it out  they're not  there yet  they're almost  getting it  all together  but I'm  getting more  and more  from the time  I signed up  with my new  phone  which was 
[02:43:00]  about  three months  ago  I guess  I've got  a lot  more  live television  on my phone  than I had  when I signed  up  give Sprint  yeah  cause they've  got that  M-Spot  service  it's like  seven bucks  a month  they just  I guess  launched it  they have  movies now  that you can  download to the  phone  but the movies  that they  licensed  right off  the bat  suck  awful things  from the 80's  short circuit  dude do you  remember HBO  a little thing  called HBO  when it first  started out  there was some  shit  I don't know 
[02:43:30]  how many times  I watched  the last  tango  in Paris  so Marlon  Brando  get fingers  put up  his ass  800 times  because it  was the only  thing HBO  would fucking  play  this will ramp  up fast  for the phones  definitely  they gotta start  somewhere though  really fast  cause people are  still just riveted  going back and  forth here  skip in New  York  skip  hey skip  skip did we  lose ya  hour late to  work because I  couldn't turn  off Patrice's  story  did we lose 
[02:44:00]  them though  I don't know  people lose  their jobs  now  skip  one more  time  no  skip  god I hear  the phone  it's right  there  skip  maybe got in  that car  action  skip  that is a  yuppie name  isn't it  skip  sorry about that  skip  look I got  Jay Leno  Tonight Show  I can watch  that  NBC News  I got Fox  News  NFL Network  I go to  music  I can watch  music videos  does it play  or does it  do it  skip shit  how much  does that  cost you  a month  he doesn't 
[02:44:30]  know  I don't  fucking  know  and when  do you  watch  it's probably  like $9.95  cause you haven't  been on public  transportation  in years  I watch it  on my little  walk from  the studio  to my truck  I watch it  on the toilet  so rather than  talk to Master  Poe  as he's  escorting you  you're watching  television  well I don't  want to distract  Poe by talking  to him  he is a lethal  weapon  that's right  would you walk  down the street  and talk to a  Walther PPK  in your hand  no  why would I talk  to a weapon 
[02:45:00]  would I talk  to a shotgun  while I walk  down the street  it's the same  thing with Poe  he is a lethal  weapon  you don't talk  to it  you use it  as a lethal  weapon  and he's  quite serious  when he's  doing the escort  because I've  been with him  he pushes  people out  of the way  like if we're  walking down  the sidewalk  and there's  a bunch of  people walking  abreast and  kind of taking  up a lot  of the sidewalk  he will give  him a little  elbow  he'll move  his arm out  and I never  even have to  look  I'm just  watching my  phone  I watch  my phone  the whole  way  Poe pushing 
[02:45:30]  people  I watch  my phone  I love  it  fabulous  Huey Lewis  is here  very cool  we should  take a break  Laszlo has  more but we  got to get  Huey in for  a few minutes  hang though  Laszlo  come back  over here  the coveted  next to  Anthony seat  I love it  look at that  you must have  did something  nice  Laszlo is a  tech pal  of mine  I got in  trouble for  listening to  Huey Lewis  at church  camp  really  tell that  story  church  camp  we didn't  like Huey  Lewis  right

[02:50:00]  for making you  wait out there  with stalker Patty  I had fun  talking to Patty  did you really  no you didn't  no I honestly  did of course  I did all the  talking  yeah she was  probably just  like gushing  over you  hi Huey  it's a pleasure  to meet you  you know Patty  oh we know her  well yeah  she's not called  stalker Patty  for nothing  she's a big fan  that's the  power of love  singing along  with your songs  and everything  that's good  Huey Lewis  man talk about  an icon 
[02:50:30]  in music  you were there  geez  beginning at MTV  how many music  videos you remember  watching with  Huey Lewis  the hit songs  one after another  it was like  you were glomming  the hits  and the guy  doesn't age  you look exactly  the same  I do  I really look good  your viewers  don't have  no  we'll get some  pictures though  that's my thing  looking good  looking good  very important thing  and a big fan  of XM right  big fan of XM 
[02:51:00]  you got XM  satellite radio  I got XM  satellite radio  what's the channels  you listen to  I go to that  80's channel  a little bit  I bounce around  the 80's  no the 80's  oh just the 80's  80's  you don't like  the decades channels  do you  I hate the decades  I am on those  all the time  I'm a niche guy  I got a whole  like preset  that is just  I go 60's  70's  80's  90's  and I'll just  pop through them  all  nostalgic  at one point  you hit 60's  and I'm a little  kid listening to  Monday 
[02:51:30]  Monday  la la  and then  boom  I'm in the 80's  it's the power  of love  da da da da  back to the future  and then  boom  I'm in the 70's  wow  wow  wow  wow  I love  it's a time machine  on four wheels  no 40's channel  huh  I figured you'd be  into that 40's channel  no I'm not quite  I'm not quite  going back to the 40's  how far back 
[02:52:00]  you go in the decades  do you go to the 40's  I love the 40's  that was the great  audio age  pre-television  that's when  that's when radio  really mattered  you know  yeah that's what  they tell me  I don't know  I mean people  learned how to  dress  and how to be  that way  I mean we were  just talking about  that outside  with Patty  she remembers  I mean you know  and you think about  the best minds  of the black generation  for example  were musicians  couldn't be  doctors and lawyers  most of them  were from the south  yeah  they were  they're from  Kansas City  or St. Louis  in those jazz bands  and they're dying 
[02:52:30]  to get to New York  to get out of the south  yeah  that's what the music  told us  and that was  the cutting edge  you know  it wasn't any TV  people listened to radio  to find out  what was hip  I like New York  in June  how about you  that kind of stuff  yeah  that was when radio  really mattered  and radio stinks now  commercial radio stinks  commercial radio  is rough  I mean all the commercials  I've been doing  the commercial radio  since I was 18  and now the satellite  it's a whole new world  I don't think  there's  you know  San Francisco  we were talking  about that  San Francisco  which you know 
[02:53:00]  pioneered FM radio  with Big Daddy  Tom Donahue  and KSAN  and KMPX  when it was really  happening  we were glued  to that channel  and now  I don't know  that there's a radio  station in San Francisco  that's programmed  by somebody  who lives in San Francisco  yeah  so all the corporations  have taken over  I think they're in Phoenix  or Fresno  or San Antonio  or somewhere like that  yeah  and it's almost impossible  for a new artist  to get on  or you know  well audio 
[02:53:30]  isn't enough anymore  no  the other thing  that's interesting  is music used to be  the domain  of blind artists  because they could  play so good  and blah blah blah  but nowadays  we're going to have  another blind  we're going to have  another Stevie Wonder  I don't know  how they make the video  yeah right  it's a problem  that and  you've got to have  something on there  for your computer  you've got to have  something on the disc  that you can pop in  and be interactive  with it  stuff like that  what are you working on  oh I'm doing  a Broadway show  at the moment 
[02:54:00]  in Chicago  Chicago the musical  which has really  been fun  wow  and it was a big  challenge for me  and I finally  kind of got it together  and it's really fun  yeah  what's the hardest part  it's got to be  memorizing things right  let's see  what is the hardest part  the hardest part  is doing it all at once  you know  you have to sing  and you have to sing  and dance  and remember all your lines  and act  and then you have to be  an ensemble player  so you know  in my gig  which I wrote myself  I can do whatever 
[02:54:30]  I want to do  if I want to go over there  I go over there  if I want to hit a different note  I hit a different note  here I have to  you know  it's very disciplined  yeah  take direction  yeah  wow man  that's got a  did you ever think  you'd do Broadway  never  yeah right  never never  and I didn't think  I would this time  either  it's daunting  you know  the talent to humility ratio  is huge on Broadway  which is refreshing  coming from rock and roll  frankly  and you know  those Broadway audiences  are fickle  oh they're the worst 
[02:55:00]  I went and saw  The Odd Couple recently  yeah  with Matthew Broderick  and Nathan Lane  and it was great  I loved it  but man  you get these Broadway  that's all these people do  is go to Broadway  you know  and they are so fickle  yeah I know  they're tough  they're really  a tough audience  yeah  well I was  I was gonna  decline politely  but as it happens  my son goes to NYU  and I was visiting him anyway  so I said  well let me see the show  and they gave me two tickets  and we went  and I was knocked out  by the show  the music is fantastic 
[02:55:30]  you gotta hear it  more than once  but it's  phenomenal  does your son want daddy  around all the time though  exactly  because I bet  you're now living in New York  right  calling him up a little too much  that's exactly right  that's exactly right  fortunately I have a show every night  and he's got a cool father  you know  Huey Lewis  but I'm sure it doesn't matter  if you got a celebrity father  it's still the same shape  it is  dad leave me alone  man  I'm trying to get laid here  you got it  you got it  how does the Broadway  the traditional Broadway 
[02:56:00]  I guess actors and singers  how do they react to you  coming in  you know  do they  do they look at it like  hey  Hot Shot Rock guy  coming in  or are you  are you warmly accepted  isn't that wild  I mean wouldn't you think  there would be a little bit  of resentment  but there isn't  as far as  either that or they're very good  at faking it  hiding it  but they're just wonderful  and they root for you  and my understudy in the role  is a guy who taught me  the role  Bernard Dotson  he's a member of the ensemble  he's a fabulous Billy Flynn  in his own right  he doesn't feel 
[02:56:30]  he's just rooting for me  behind the scenes  he's calling up the guys  from the news  and going  I think Huey wants to get  the band back together  get him out of here please  I can't tell you  how wonderful the company  has been  and how great everybody is  and I would think  you know  I would think  if I was a gypsy  and I'd been working  on Broadway for 20 years  I'd feel a little resentment  when some guy came in  but I haven't felt  a thing like that  hey what happened  to the news  we're writing  we're going back  you are  but what are those guys  doing while you're doing this  they're writing  do they do other 
[02:57:00]  playing other gigs  oh they do other band  projects and stuff  well yeah  everybody's got home studios  you've still been touring though  as a band  yeah  this whole time  yeah  we never  we got someone on the line  that says they  see Huey every year  in Atlantic City  see  yeah Atlantic City's huge  well we  yeah  a lot  yeah  no you know something  it's a gig  when I drive there  when I drive there  you see billboards  of people you never  would have thought  would have played  Atlantic City  same thing 
[02:57:30]  and I think Vegas  kind of turned that around  because Vegas used to be  where it was kind of cheesy  if you ended up in Vegas  not anymore  now though  there are big name rock acts  playing Vegas and Atlantic City  and the same thing's true  you know if you were a TV actor  you didn't do film  yeah  that's all blown out of the water  now  yeah  commercials is another thing  it's all screen time  people really don't care about it  it's not selling out  if your song ends up in a commercial anymore  I tell you the amazing thing  about Atlantic City  is that  you know we  the amount of money  they pay you Huey  come on  they pay us well  the gigs are sold out  and you can't get a hotel room 
[02:58:00]  yeah  and it's you know  Atlantic City  it's not Hawaii  you know what I mean  you do a little of that gambling  eh very little  I like to play craps  but usually when I'm working in a hotel  you don't want to get bothered  if you go down  so I don't gamble  you don't like getting bothered anymore  eh  I don't mind it  let's face it  when did it get old  it's so recognizable  anybody who does what I do  has got to like the attention  a little bit  or even done it in the first place  but when did it get old for you  when they start bothering your family  well you know  there's a part of the time  or when you're trying to take a leak 
[02:58:30]  and some guy's trying to shake your hand  that's not good  there had to be a moment  where you're like  wow man  this is  this is  this is kind of a drag  well  like I said  anybody who does what I do  has got to like the attention  he would have done it to begin with  so there's a period of time  when you actually enjoy it  yeah of course  there's another period of time  when you tolerate it  and hopefully there's a much  smaller period of time  when it drives you up the wall  yeah  so you know  and everybody's got a horror story  on some celebrity  and I tell you the best  the worst stories  are the first class flight attendants  because  this is my theory now 
[02:59:00]  this is a personal theory  if you're in an airport  you're kind of like fair game  yeah  and so you're signing autographs  and being nice  and blah blah blah  and you can't wait to get on the airplane  so they stop  finally they board the airplane  you get in your first class  you sit down in your seat  and the flight attendant goes  oh my gosh  can I have your autograph  and you're stuck with them  I saw Bob Saget  was sitting in front of me  we were flying back from LA last time  and  he flipped out  he  one of the flight attendants  would not leave him alone  right  just kept coming up 
[02:59:30]  and talking to him  and asking him things  and then going  alright I'll leave you alone  I'm sorry  and then two seconds later  would come back again  yeah  and you know  where's Bob Saget going  unless he's got a parachute  he's there for the duration  and just being  you'd think they would  tell these people  leave them alone  but that's where you get  your best horror stories  are from limousine drivers  and first class flight attendants  you gotta do the spinal tap thing  with the limo driver  right in the middle of talking  you just bring the divider up  fucking line these  what's wild  I love that scene  what's wild about the limousine drivers 
[03:00:00]  is you assume  that they're entirely discreet  cause you get in the back  of a limousine  and the guy's up there  and he's got a uniform on  and he says nothing  and you talk about  whatever you want to talk about  but all you need to know  is get in a limousine  and sometimes say  hey who have you had  in here lately  and they'll just know everything  what they've done  what they've talked about  that's it  yeah bastards  well we got a lot of people  that want to say hi to Huey  Huey Lewis  Andrew in New York  what's up  hey how you doing  I wanted to ask Huey  how he felt about 
[03:00:30]  the use of his music  in American Psycho  yeah man  I'm fine with that  yeah  I enjoyed it  that was such a great scene  yeah I enjoyed that  the guy  you know I'd read the book  which is a lot darker  than the movie  believe it or not  but there was  they  there was  we had a bit  there was kind of  a slightly ugly story  about the whole thing  what happened was  they asked us  to use the song  in the film  I hadn't seen the film  I knew the book  I said sure  they had  William Defoe 
[03:01:00]  it was clearly  a serious movie  we said sure  and on the eve  of the release movie  they sprung this  soundtrack CD on us  that they're going to release  well the soundtrack CD  had our tune  and a bunch of source music  it wasn't a great CD  and I thought  eh you know  I was on the road  my manager said  we never signed up  for the CD  and we don't want our fans  to buy it for the one song  no thank you  we don't want to be on the CD  well  they were miffed by that  so they issued  a press release 
[03:01:30]  on the eve  of the thing  that I had pulled  my track from the CD  because I hated the movie  that it was so violent  and blah blah blah  and that's why  that grounds will start  I hadn't even seen the movie  so I think it's fine  enjoyed it  do you like Huey Lewis  in the news  love that scene  let's go to John in Texas  John  hey how's it going guys  hey John  look I was going to ask  Mr. Ruth  I'm kind of an 80's kid  I'm a semi fan  what I really wanted to know  is you were not an unknown  when you did  the Back to the Future movies 
[03:02:00]  and how did that  propel your further  rise to fame  with their set of movies  well  you know  an actual fact  you know  they asked us  do we want to write a song  Steven Spielberg  Bob Zemeckis  and Bob Gale  who produced  name dropper  directed  and wrote the film  asked to have a meeting  we had a meeting  down there at Amblin  and they said  we've written this movie  and this character  Marty McFly's favorite band  would be Huey Lewis  in the news  how would you like to write  a song for the film  and I said 
[03:02:30]  we don't know how to write  for film  but I'll send you  the next thing we write  don't know how to write  for film  which was  a couple of hit songs  sure  well we just  we just wrote  Power of Love  and sent it to him  which I actually  didn't think was going  to work  because there was  no love interest  but they used it  and the song was released  and it was a number one  record before the movie  was released  so Zemeckis  to this day  I saw him  at the 25 year  you know  DVD thing  three pack  whatever  and he said  I bought it  I know  he said  that was a big key  the marketing  of the film  was that the song 
[03:03:00]  was a smash  before the movie  came out  so it didn't really  the way  the movies  didn't do anything  for me really  it was great  that the song  was a big hit  and it was probably  a bigger hit  because of the movie  so there  sorry  you're just too darn loud  exactly  it's not a big line  do you stand  any  do you help  Ray Parker Jr.  I love it  I can't talk about that  I'm afraid  not at all  no  one of those  can't talk about  that was one of those  ugly things  a deal was done  and shut up  wow  does he call you 
[03:03:30]  no Christmas card  how big was  how big was  Huey Lewis  in the news  at your biggest point  comparable to  six feet  the Stones  I don't know  were you as big  as the biggest  rock groups out there  that people still  talk about  or something  at your highest  was you as big  as U2  or something  sports  and four  huge  like you  couldn't even  imagine  I'm trying to  equate it to  a hip hop artist  something you  don't understand 
[03:04:00]  the truth  I can't even  big legit  just big like that  massive  really  I mean  I know  I know  I know  Huey Lewis  in the news  I want a new  I know that shit  I'm just saying  I want  how big  cause I'm so stupid  I thought maybe  the motherfuckers  that went  take on me  I don't fucking  know  are you out of your  mind  one hit  that was a big  one for me  take on me  Huey looked like  he wanted to  knock the motherfuckers  I'm just saying  I don't know  how big  he was 
[03:04:30]  we were as big  as Pee Wee Herman  when he was  as big as  at his peak  you're doing great  with Huey  you mentioned  Ray Parker  and Aha  his question  knock your teeth  out  I'm just asking  what the fuck  do you want  from me  Jesus Christ  Aha had one hit  although they were  huge in Europe  who was  Aha Aha  I mean I'm not  comparing this guy  I know he's a rocker  but I'm just saying  in terms of  bigness  he was huge  what is bigness  what is bigness  what  record sales  lots of number ones 
[03:05:00]  right  booty  a few number ones  few  many millions  sold  yeah I guess  they made us  rip up the tape  at church camp  I'll tell you  what happened there  got in trouble  because he was  listening to you  Huey  there's a  interesting new artist  called Paul Thorne  who's a real good  songwriter and a  buddy of ours  who opens for us  and he was  raised in Tupelo  Mississippi  and his father  was a Baptist  preacher  and he wasn't  allowed any  electric music  and the first  record he got  was Picture This  it was one of our  really  yeah 
[03:05:30]  and  I didn't think  it was quite such  devilish music  they made us  rip up him  and Duran Duran  Duran Duran  yeah  I can see that  wait what happened  last time  that's the slippery  slope to hell  you go to these  church camps  like a week long  you know  you're a young kid  you have chapel  every night  and they just  rail on and on  about you know  current music  and how it's  the path to the devil  and all this  and then you  they maybe see you  listening to your  Walkman  what are you  listening to  and  well I'll tell you  one thing  seriously  I probably shouldn't 
[03:06:00]  say this  but it's okay  and I like the music  a lot  but the message  for rappers  about get rich  or die trying  that's a hell of a  message  isn't it to give  the kids  get rich  or die trying  I mean  I don't get that  quite frankly  in my day  at least  it was a little  more  you know  creative than  that  I think  and that's  the one thing  I worry  well it's from  where you are  very materialistic  very materialistic  and they buy  into that whole  American thing  what  what  there we go 
[03:06:30]  very materialistic  your people  Patrice has woken up  don't you think  I mean  no I mean  I'm saying  it's just  where you're from  it's like  fucking  how come  white people  have such  great music  why the fuck  that's the question  I mean  I want a new drug  I mean  give me a fucking break  I love  I want a new drug  it was a metaphor  it was a metaphor  why the fuck  can't 50  have a metaphor  get rich or die trying  what's the metaphor  have a heart attack  because you're working  so fucking hard 
[03:07:00]  no it's not  it does not  he doesn't say  get rich or kill a motherfucker  in a bank robbery  because he's  it's a metaphor  I don't know why  what is that a metaphor for  the same metaphor  that I want a new drug  the connotation  that you can make  I'm just saying  it's the same thing  as get rich  or die trying  how come it can't be  I'm going to work hard  until I die  it's actually  completely opposite  right  want a new drug  is about  I want a new drug  that makes me feel  like when I'm with you 
[03:07:30]  which is love  bubble  I mean  it ain't the biggest  message in the world  but  all I hear  is drug use  that's what I hear  the rest is  fucking Spanish  to me  it's just cocaine  to me  you're right  well we got  Mark the trucker  on the line  Mark what's up  hey how you doing  fellas  pretty good  morning  Huey I wanted to ask you  did you ever find  that new drug  still looking  man  still looking  I love your band  man  I listen to you all the time 
[03:08:00]  I appreciate it  very cool  Dave in California  Dave  yeah hey guys  how you doing today  pretty good  having a good time  hey Huey  I met you years ago  over at the AT&T  pro I am  how's the golf game  going  non-existent  it's 22 degrees  in New York City  man  he lives in New York  now so  you gotta get back  to California  there goes the handicap  right  yeah there goes the handicap  we got the best courses  you know  it's punching out  actually I'll tell you  Long Island's got some  awesome golf courses  you go all the way  out east there  I haven't been out there  black course 
[03:08:30]  there are a lot of them  out there  make sure you play  national  black  that's the one where  you tee off  first hole  and lose your ball  you'd never find  it's over 200 yards  before you even  hit the fairway  yeah  on some of these holes  yeah  before you even  hit the fairway  do you find it harder  to write now  than it was  back in the 80's  maybe  I mean  do you run out of  ideas or things  to write  yeah  I mean  that's very valid  I don't know why  that is  but part of it 
[03:09:00]  is when you've  written a bunch of  songs  and now you go  to start writing  something  it's kind of like  something you already  did  you can't have  rock and roll  we have a song  called Harder Rock  and Roll  well there's your  rock and roll  in the title song  yeah you don't want  you can't have  the kidney of rock  and roll  you know what I mean  I mean you're  done with that  so there is stuff  that were places  you can't go  because you already  did that in a way  and is there also  just getting a little  older  your mindset changes  so some of the  subject matter  you know Dylan  dealt with that  in the 60 Minutes  thing which was 
[03:09:30]  very interesting  and they asked him  you just don't know  where those songs  come from  to be honest  you know  you have to be  open to that  and the muse  comes or she  doesn't  and it is tougher  to write when you  get older I think  but I also think  the 12 things  like a CD now  is 12 tunes  or something  I think that's  just too many  yeah  and why is it  that recorded music  all has to be  the exact same size  and the exact same price  in other words  why are all  12 songs 
[03:10:00]  for no matter  if it's Miles Davis  or 50 cent  why has it all  got to be the same  why  look  paintings are  different sizes  and different prices  books are different sizes  and different prices  even wine  for Christ's sake  is different price  what about  limited vintage  aimed to a  boutique-y market  and then  Joni Mitchell  might make another record  and Randy Newman  might make another record  but we're losing  our great artists  because  everything's the same price  it's sold like a commodity  and record labels 
[03:10:30]  therefore  if they want to  maximize the profits  they've got to sell  more CDs  so they aim for the kids  this sounds to me  like you want to  write three songs  and get 20 bucks  an album for it  now you're talking  that's kind of  what I'm getting here  that's what the record  companies are upset about  with iTunes  everything should not  be 99 cents  they're saying  some songs  are worth 20 cents  other songs  are worth 2 dollars  and 50 cents  bottom line is  it ought to be  treated as an art form  American popular music  is arguably  America's greatest  contribution to the world  and culture 
[03:11:00]  40 years ago  America grew things  I'd put polio back  we invented the internet  I think I might put  that over  I'd say polio vaccine  music  I wasn't polio vaccine  started in France  I think  with Pasteur  or really  Louis Pasteur  I don't know  but whatever  American  but when you go  around the world  today  that you hear  America's music  everywhere  I mean in Africa  in Europe  and Asia  and we 
[03:11:30]  our business  that is  treats it like  gasoline or rice  like a commodity  I also always wanted  to know  especially with  somebody  that's had  the success  that you've had  and the amount  of hit songs  when you play out  when you write  a new album  let's say  and you put out  new music  and you perform  it live  you know  what the majority  let's say  pretty much  99% of the audience  is there  they want to see  the stuff that you've  done already  your hits  is that frustrating 
[03:12:00]  as an artist  that's a great question  it's a very good  question  I'll tell you why  I went and saw  the Stones  over the summer  and it was like  the new stuff  is definitely  really good  but it's like  why are you  wasting 20 minutes  on the new stuff  I want to hear  you know  sympathy  or what have you  and that's  understandable  people want to  hear your songbook  and as long as  you don't work  too much  it's real fun  to play your songbook  I mean you love  those songs anyway  as long as you don't  have to play them  200 nights a year  so that's why  you tour  and take big breaks  between tours  we work 85 shows 
[03:12:30]  a year  which is fine  it's like falling  in love all over again  but then again  you do need new things  why?  because as a storyteller  you need a new story  every once in a while  and so all you need  are one or two things  for yourself  and that's generally  what happens  they make a new record  the Stones  they come out  they play two songs  from it  and then all of a sudden  do you ever glance over  at one of the guys  in the band  during Power Love  or something  and just go  you believe we're still  playing this song?  when you get to that point  it's time to take  a little bit of a holiday  I mean when you see  a band up there 
[03:13:00]  and they do 36 minutes  and the singer comes out  after 15  and they're miserable  it's because  it's their sixth night  in a row  I mean if you don't  work too much  it's like falling in love  all over again  take two weeks off  it's a ball  it's the creative curse  because we do a very  creative radio show  and there are times  they look at Anthony  like can you believe  we're telling this  fucking story again  but we have to  I'm not even kidding you  and some of you  who's going to put  the weird little  different twist on it  and some of the old  listeners will call us out  like dude you've told  that story ten times  but we know like  the audience is building  and building  and we have to go down  some of these roads 
[03:13:30]  the time it's not a crow  it's an owl  so how do some groups  I'm sorry go ahead  go ahead  no it's okay  how do some groups  get out  like I'm just  I keep saying you too  because it's the only  thing I can think of  in terms  but it seems like  people are accepting  to you too  who's been around  for years and years  they're accepting  that they're going  to play new music  and they're not going  to play whatever  their hit was  they're one of the few  man  but how do you  how do you get that thing  we want to hear  the new shit too  it's very hard  to go through  a couple of decades  and be relevant 
[03:14:00]  and update yourself  where you're just  as popular as you were  and it's because  of your new music  and your old catalog  I don't know  how it's done  I don't know  what the formula  is there  I think that's a good point  and they've done  a very good job  they take huge breaks  between records  and really work  on their new records  number one  and number two  they are subject  to some of those  same things  people go see  you two  they want to hear  the old things too  that's true  did you used to 
[03:14:30]  write on the road  yeah  we have interviewed  so many bands  and when they go  and tour  they stop the  creative process  I don't get that  I would think  if I was the lead singer  and I was writing  the songs for the band  that I would just  would be writing  all the time  it seems like  then the tour ends  it's like  alright now it's time  to write the new album  and I never understood  that when bands  would come in here  and tell us that  well because  when you're doing a show  if you're putting a show  together  then your day time  is worried about  re-remake  re-working the show  I think there's  down time on the bus 
[03:15:00]  or the hotel room  where all of a sudden  you got a little thought  it almost seems like  they don't even  use that part of their brain  until the tour is over  and we wrote a lot  of our good stuff  on the road  in the early days  and again  don't write so much  on the road anymore  so maybe that's a problem  I mean  writing is a chore  it's tough  and Joni Mitchell said  what's interesting  is that now  you know  my stuff is  our pop songs  and I don't mean  that demeaningly  I mean I like  you know rock and roll  can be about anything  as long as 
[03:15:30]  when the guy says  I'm going to Kansas City  they got some crazy  little women there  and I'm going to get me one  we believe he's going  to Kansas City  he knows about  the crazy little women  and he wants to get him one  and it's rock and roll  you know  so it can be about anything  it doesn't need to be  about things  but you're informed  by your audience  to a certain extent  in the old days  you write with the radio  you know there are people  out there  Want A New Drug  is a pop song  sent to a generation  that relates to that  well how do you do that  when now you know 
[03:16:00]  you're not going to get  played on the radio  period  I mean Joni Mitchell  made this same point  so who are you writing for  and where are you going to go  you go to television  it's the only place  our crowd  if you're over 28  and you know  white and not country  then you've got to go to TV  and where do you go  you go David Letterman  and then you get  tacked on at the end  and he doesn't talk to you  it's just cheap  to be a singer anymore  so it's tougher to write  because you're informed  by your audience 
[03:16:30]  there's no going to MTV anymore  radio has really abandoned  a lot of good music  I remember when Joni  and video  and MTV  you guys were huge on MTV  and it was a little odd  because you  even then  you guys didn't really  fit the bill  of what was going on  at the time  you know  I mean  you didn't have  the look  of the guys  that were on there  I remember  as a matter of fact  what was it  one Beavis and Butthead  I believe it was like  this guy looks like  a friend of my dad's  it was just hysterical 
[03:17:00]  well you know  we never were  we formed right before  music television  in the late 70s  so we never really  set ourselves up  to be trendy  because it was no  it was an audio deal  it wasn't about  the visual thing  it was an audio deal  now  had we started later  we probably would have  adopted  I mean  we would have done anything  believe me  if nothing else  it's a compliment  to your music  because you know  you wanted to talk  and it served us well  over the long haul  because now  our stuff that we wrote  in our 20s 
[03:17:30]  is actually more relevant  we were anachronistic then  you know  we were old fashioned then  and now it actually  lives stuck with you  doing off my baby  if this is it  these are more  for sort of  were you one of the bands  affected by Nirvana  what do you mean  affected by Nirvana  well I mean  oh man I like Huey  because he's a  that's alright  you got me  motherfucking  what do you mean  affected by  what do you mean  nigga  say it  there were a lot of bands  there were a lot of bands  that went away  because of Nirvana  like the hair bands  and stuff  like what effect  did that have  on you guys  I don't know 
[03:18:00]  we were  we were  because you weren't  really in the  we were off the radio  you really weren't  in the hair band  category that it  really affected  but it seemed like  that just reinvented  everything  when they came around  I don't know  I think the hair bands  affected like that  whole influx of poison  and Motley Crue  and everything  kind of got  where MTV was like  this is all we're playing  you turned on MTV  all you saw was a blonde  lead singer  with the hair down  to his ass  and the makeup  and stuff  and that was good 
[03:18:30]  some guy welding  and then a shot  of some chicks  a chick with a sword  that would affect him  though  I imagine that  would affect you  and how about  now the television  became so much  more important  a lot of our  pop bands  and hard rock bands  seem to come  from Sweden  what's up with that  when did  when did  Scandinavia  be a hotbed  of American  popular music  they are the  whitest people  you can find  they're the most  attractive  and they look  good on television  99 Luftballons  I think she was 
[03:19:00]  German  whatever  but you know  just to finish  the previous thought  and Randy Newman  said this  who's one of my  favorite artists  he won an Oscar  for the song  he wrote  for the  Toy Story  is that right  I think it was  Toy Story  got a friend in me  or something  and he kind of  pooh-poohed it  in an article  that I read  because his  latest record  which I still  think is his  latest record  it's called  Bad Love  it's an album  and if you're 
[03:19:30]  a Randy Newman fan  it's a masterpiece  record  and sold nothing  and never got a play  nothing  where would it  get played  yeah exactly  that's the problem  it's an absolute  masterpiece  it's funny  it's poignant  it's wonderful  it's musically rich  it's orchestrated  wonderfully  well produced  really great  probably his best work  wow  and he got no attention  yeah  that's a bitch  thanks  and what about  acting  go get him 
[03:20:00]  satellite radio  any more movies  you got pretty  good reviews  for duets  I saw that  in a hotel  one night  and you did  a great job  I am in showbiz  and I'll do  anything for money  or attention  is that it  alright  it's Huey Lewis  he's on Broadway  doing the Chicago thing  anything else  we're promoting  today  no  you can promote  I can promote  you gotta have a CD  or something out there  our best work  is a thing called  Live at 25  it's a DVD 
[03:20:30]  and a live CD  and it's out  a year now  it's a snapshot  of where we are  at the moment  we've sort of  reinvented ourselves  over the last 10 years  we have a three piece  horn section now  we've sort of  reversed  into the  playing music  the way  there was  before  we got five  autographed copies  of that  we'll give away  right now  nice  Huey thanks  this was great  hey thanks a lot  nice chat with you guys  keep up the good work  alright  from O&A Pictures  comes a true story 
[03:21:00]  of one man's pain  it does hurt  and a family  torn apart  and it makes you feel  really funny  right after it happens  the war  of the Kumias  I have a yelling  parents too  growing up  until they got divorced  and it was just  you know  and then you'd see  like the old man  and he'd pick  the plate  full of spaghetti  and throw it  and it would hit  like the wall  next to the phone  and you're sitting  there horrified  watching the spaghetti  slowly go down  on the wall  get the fuck out  of the gold  fuck you  oh the horrified kids 
[03:21:30]  did that actually leave  after the fights  uh yeah  a lot of times  sure  and then you know  you'd be able to go to sleep  because the yelling  would stop  first mom would have to  wind down  even after dad left  she's still going  keep that shit  like I need a fucking  hole in the head  I'm trying to sleep  he's gone  shut up  shut up  oh god  he's been gone  a half hour  when would he come back  the next day  yeah like the next day  you know  they'd be sitting down  watching like  Ronan Martin's laughing  laughing 
[03:22:00]  everything was fine  you know  and then out of nowhere  you'd hear the rumbling  you'd be in bed  and you'd be like  and then you hear  from the kids  can't you two  just shut the fuck up  for like one night  and then we were  pretty young  so you know  we got you know  called into the room  and mom sits down  and goes  me and your father  I want you to know  and I want you to know  it has nothing to do  with you  we're divorced 
[03:22:30]  oh okay  can I go out  and play now  how is this going  to change my life  does this mean  I don't have to listen  to  oh it does  okay  so it's a good thing  great  well thank you  for staying together  for so long  and really like  torturing us  you couldn't have  pulled this one  like five years ago  yeah fucking asshole  but maybe we couldn't  remember as much  and didn't have  to listen to the  yelling and screaming  here's an idea pop  there you go 
[03:23:00]  right back  into the huntington  boat ramp  give that a whirl  the war  of the kuyas  you gotta figure  you're gonna just  sit there disgusted  having to listen  to this crap  calling off freaks  I've been doing  subpar radio  for the last 10 years  well we haven't  thanks anyway  appreciate it  no worries  alright  hey Huey was cool 
[03:23:30]  I don't want people  to know I'm a nice guy  so shut up  yeah Huey was great  that was very cool  having Huey Lewis  hell yeah man  Patrice is over there  sawing on his hand  with a plastic knife  during that interview  rolling his eyes  no I wasn't  I was listening to Hue  I just didn't want  to piss him off  because he was like  when he asked the question  because you want to  ask those kind of  those things  that's why  David Lee Roth  was so cool  because you just said  you go  hey man  what was it like  the pussy 
[03:24:00]  which pussy was better  your first fame  or your second fame  and he just bam  but you know  I have to be careful  with you  what was that question  you asked  and it's like  oh the Nirvana  did Nirvana destroy  that fell flat on its face  no it didn't  he knew what you meant  it's just  what the hell  what motherfucker  say that again  say it again  Greg if you say that shit  one more  it's like  it's like you go  it's like nah  did he ruin your career  the reality is  when Nirvana hit  there were a lot of bands  that went bye bye  yeah I think he was  coasting and having a good time 
[03:24:30]  and making a lot of money  I think he had already peaked  and was on the back end though  during the Nirvana thing  yeah that's what I was trying to figure out  it was the hair bands  that got  I know it was mostly the hair bands  that's why I asked the question  because everyone knows  it was the hair bands  but I was wondering  how deep it went  that's the only reason  I went there  if I listen to Huey's music  it would be  if I listen to Huey's music  it would be  and you said  what era is this  even with digital remastering  and you just play the song  I would go  80s  yeah  as 80s  early or mid 80s  you know it's happy  it's just no 
[03:25:00]  there's no music  it guided to 90 days  with his shit  he made it to where  I know the songs  check on that  see what like  his last  top  Patrice  top 20 song  when I saw you  at Avery Fisher Hall  you do a Michael Jackson  music thing  that is beyond hilarious  I tried to explain it  to Anthony one day  but I just couldn't do it  there was a time  where you were  it was okay  to listen to Michael Jackson  yeah you can't  it's like you can't  Michael Jackson 
[03:25:30]  now  it's like  cause he's so  like he's not like  okay if the guy  that made the song  if Dexy's Midnight Runner  guy  the come on our lean guy  accused of pedophilia  yeah  you can easily go  fuck you  you're done  I'm never gonna listen  to you again  but you can't just go  fuck Michael Jackson  you can't go  I'm not listening  to this motherfucker  so you gotta rationalize  how you go  okay I'm only gonna  listen to  this is the  this is the best  analogy ever 
[03:26:00]  I'm only gonna listen  to pre-pedophile  so you can go  you can listen  to Thriller  you know  Billy G  but then when you go  you are not alone  you go  oh my god  was he touching  kids during that shit  he's a pedophile  fuck  yeah but it says  released in 89  but did that mean  he wrote it in 80  fuck  was he a pedophile  doing that shit  cause he's so important  as a musician  you can't just  say  you can't just throw away 
[03:26:30]  Michael Jackson  you can't do it  you can't do it man  you know  isn't that great  it's just pre  god damn it  what about that  black or white song  that's safe right  it is black  no that's the  that's the song  that's the black or white  song for Michael Jackson  that's the one  that black people  a lot of people  don't know this shit  cause we don't  black people  and white people  don't share news  you know  like y'all are  deeply  into  y'all are deeply  into  what song is this  what is this  Michael Jackson 
[03:27:00]  is this a Michael Jackson song  oh  I wouldn't mind  if we lost this one  yeah  thanks  fine by me  but it's like  a lot of the news  that white people  are into  black people  just not into  at the time  you know what I'm saying  and a lot of people  don't know  black people  got rid of  Michael Jackson  um  there's only one  way black people  tell you  fuck off  is if you stop  trying to be black  that's it  that's your  that's your career  end right there  once black  once black people  go  this motherfucker  ain't trying to be  you know  fuck him
