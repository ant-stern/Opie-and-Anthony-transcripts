<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, as evidenced by these excerpts, was a highly irreverent and vulgar affair, characterized by shocking humor and often offensive language.  The show, hosted by E-Rock in this instance (playing previously aired segments), covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.

The broadcast began with E-Rock playing a segment detailing Anthony's ongoing battle with a raccoon infestation in his attic.  The segment involved numerous callers offering a variety of solutions, ranging from humane trapping to extremely violent suggestions for raccoon removal, and concluded with Anthony successfully trapping a raccoon. This was followed by a brief staff discussion regarding workplace bullying, drawing parallels between Dr. Laura Schlesinger's past use of the N-word and the Paula Deen controversy.  The show then moved to a discussion of Club Soda Kenny, Opie's bodyguard, focusing on Cosmo Radio's humorous commentary on Kenny's perceived ineffectiveness and past conflicts between the two radio shows.  Intern David and Bobo (who was suffering from a hemorrhoid) were mentioned in this section.  Several callers contributed humorous anecdotes relating to wildlife and other experiences.

A later segment featured a discussion of a woman’s Nair mishap, followed by a lengthy in-studio interview with Kenny, who remained evasive about his role and nickname. This segment then transitioned into a discussion with Taylor and Victoria from Cosmo Radio, quickly descending into sexually charged banter and jokes about physical appearance.  This segued into another discussion about Dr. Laura Schlesinger's use of the N-word, with varying opinions expressed by the hosts and guests. This discussion concluded with a graphic and extended segment about Bobo's hemorrhoid, involving several hosts and guests attempting to inspect and smell it.

Subsequent segments focused heavily on Dr. Laura Schlesinger’s use of the N-word, playing clips of her show and involving multiple callers, including a Black male caller who shared his perspective on the word's usage within different communities.  This led to a discussion of the media's reaction and the broader context of the word's meaning and power dynamics.  The discussion branched into cyberbullying, including clips of celebrities discussing the issue and referencing *Back to the Future* as an example of bullying.  Opie recounted a pre-taped segment featuring comedian Dustin Chafin, whose family history involved a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Tim Gunn from *Project Runway* called in, sharing his own suicide attempt and advocating for the Trevor Project, while facing crude interruptions from the hosts.  The show further explored the hypocrisy of celebrities addressing cyberbullying while simultaneously engaging in or profiting from invasions of privacy, citing specific examples. Callers Bill Hart and Brendan (from whatwouldtylerdurdendo.com) contributed to the discussion, particularly criticizing Perez Hilton's hypocrisy.  Clips from Cindy Lauper, Ellen DeGeneres, and Perez Hilton were played, with the hosts offering cynical counterpoints.

The final segment detailed a pre-recorded bit involving Intern David and porn star Lisa Sparks.  The bit involved a staged scenario where David unknowingly interacts with Lisa, leading to increasingly inappropriate physical contact, culminating in a staged confrontation with a man posing as Lisa's husband.  This segment, alongside the pre-recorded bit, concluded with David apologizing, and the discussion focused on the level of pre-planning and the reactions of those involved. A following segment featured a staged prank where a man (David) groped a woman, resulting in a confrontation with an angry "husband" (Carlton), who was actually a plant.  This event sparked further discussion about the use of the N-word amongst the hosts and guests, eventually concluding with a bizarre suggestion of mutual fellatio. Throughout the entire broadcast, the language used by the hosts, guests, and callers was frequently vulgar, offensive, and sexually suggestive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the worst of Opian Anthony, my name is E-Rock, I am E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you  care to follow along at home. It's the worst of Opian Anthony. Opian Anthony are off, 
[00:00:30]  so what do we do? We play best of that we call worst of, and hopefully you enjoy it.  On today's show, we dig back a little bit, see what we can find. We found a bit from  Intern David, always popular, the Intern David bits. We talk about cyberbullying of celebrities,  and we also get into a staff discussion about being bullied. Dr. Laura took some heat for  using the N-word a couple years back in light of the Paula Deen situation. We figured, you  know, it might be appropriate to play that, so you can see how far we have progressed  as a society involving the N-word there. Bobo is on the show, everybody's favorite. He 
[00:01:00]  has a hemorrhoid, we'll check on that later. And Club Soda Kenny has a run-in with Cosmo  Radio. But for now, we're going to start. This bit is from 2010. Anthony had a raccoon that  was sort of invading his backyard, so he went through this whole scheme of setting up a trap.  He just had a bunch of problems involving this thing. Anthony's raccoon problem, right here,  right now. It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show. There is a lot going on today, though.  Yeah, I saw that. You were telling me that you got raccoons. We should start with that, 
[00:01:30]  man. You got raccoons in a really nice house out there on Long Island. The compound has raccoons.  You know, I've been defending against the wrong thing for so many years.  And raccoons have taken up residence in my attic. That might just be a little karma, man.  You think? You make fun of raccoons all the time. Well, yeah. And now all of a sudden you got raccoons 
[00:02:00]  in your what? In your attic? Well, in my attic. At first, they've been knocking over  bail boxes, driving through people's backyards. They've been knocking over my garbage pails  and foraging through my garbage. And, you know, that's really fucking annoying. But at least they're  not in the house. Now, I noticed this kind of weird, if the bedroom gets warm, it's this weird  musty smell. Ah, shit. And I'm like, I am not into fucking smells. 
[00:02:30]  You're changing the sheets, right? After these weekends. Oh, of course.  After these weekends of yours. Changing them. I throw them out. All right, good.  I think that's the raccoons marking their territory. I'm no expert, but I think they have  basically said to themselves, this is our house. This is ours.  And we need to mark everything. Well, they have. So other raccoons and other things don't  live here. They absolutely have. They went upstairs. You sure they're not wandering around 
[00:03:00]  your house? No, just the attic. Look for droppings. Just the attic. I did, and the exterminator  did. Oh, okay. Because I had an exterminator come over. Lickety split. Of course.  Yesterday. And he went through the attic and said, yeah, there's droppings, which is shit.  I got raccoon shit in my attic. But the guys up there, the raccoons have to be up there.  No, not, not in the daytime. Where the fuck are they going during the daytime? I don't know.  They always say if you see a raccoon during the daytime, he's sick. Yeah, but then at night, 
[00:03:30]  like in the morning, they'll leave. They like have a schedule like me. Are you sure they're  leaving? Yes, they leave in the morning. They go out, they do their shit. Then they fucking  like, I don't know what they do. They go somewhere. But they're nocturnal. They do all their shit  in the night. Yeah, but they like, they leave at like five in the morning. They leave  at the house. That's what this guy's telling you? They come in, like, yeah, and then they're  in and out during the night. Maybe they got a summer home. Doing their shenanigans. Maybe  they do. What are they doing? Maybe they're at a neighbor's house. Shit, dude, you might 
[00:04:00]  have sick raccoons if they're leaving in the morning. No. No. Or maybe they're going to  another part of the house. No, I haven't seen any evidence of raccoons in the house. This  is really strange. The exterminator went up and found droppings. How many does he think  are living up in the attic? I don't know, a couple? A couple, but then they have a few  little ones, probably. When I walked out one day about a month and a half ago, I found a  little raccoon walking across the lawn. And he was looking at me as he's walking, and then 
[00:04:30]  he gives me this passing look like, what the fuck are you doing in my house? That's  how he looked at me. Yeah. And now I got to deal with this. So I set, well, the exterminator  set up traps around the garbage where they usually fuck around. And then the exterminator's coming  back with a ladder that he didn't have a big, tall ladder to look up where he thinks they're  getting in. So he's got to seal that shit up. Why can't they just seal houses? Especially 
[00:05:00]  new ones when they're building them. I know. What do you mean he sees where they're coming  in? He thinks there might be a place where that round turret-y thing meets the square  roof. Which, you know, I want to kill my builder for a fucking... A design flaw?  Leaving that. Yeah. Has to be, right? Yeah, it's got to be. Is it by a tree? Or are they  going up to the roof? No, they'll climb up anything, most things. They'll use anything to climb  up. They're amazing. Little magical creatures. Are they as bad as possums, though? Or as 
[00:05:30]  as disgusting as possums? Uh, yeah, they're just as bad. They're cute, is the problem. The  problem is they're cute, but I would imagine they do a hell of a lot more damage than possums.  Disruptive, shit like that. You could run over a possum, and it'll pretty much just keep  walking. Yeah, yeah. They are. I've run over a possum before. Horrible things. Just the  thud it makes. Call them a possum or an old possum? Huh? Do you call them possums or old  possums? Old possums. I hate the O in front. I saw an old possum. 
[00:06:00]  So, I have traps set. And, uh, so last night before I go to bed, I figure, let me check  the trap. I go out there. Isn't that creepy, checking traps, though? Yeah, a little bit.  When I was catching mice in my old apartment, it was always creepy to go check the traps.  Check the trap. Well, these are humane traps. Aw, you should get a bear trap. They catch  him, and they catch him in those little, uh, you know, wire traps. Right. And then the thing's  like, like, hisses at you and gets all pissed off. Yeah. I poke at him with a stick and 
[00:06:30]  then throw the trap in the pool. But, uh, I check the trap, and I see, uh, these shiny  eyes looking back at me. And you're like, damn, that one. And the trap is shut. I'm like,  nice. So as I walk up, there's, there's a little kitty in my trap. A kitty cat. There  he is. There's a picture of the kitty cat. So now I had to figure out how this trap works 
[00:07:00]  and open it up, and the kitty was hissing and all pissed off. Was he scared, you think?  Oh, he was petrified. Poor little guy. So I opened it up, and he darted out and left, and  then I reset it. Have you ever seen that cat before, though? No. Is it your neighbor's  cat? I don't know where it came from. Fuck, dude. Animals are just taking over your backyard  when you're not. It's suburbia. When you're not around. They're everywhere. I swear I'm  going to get a pellet gun. Little fuckers. But, uh, then I said it. So this morning when  I leave, I got to check the trap. It's open. The food's there. The raccoon didn't go in. 
[00:07:30]  No. The dumb cat's going to be in there, I bet, when I get back home. Of course. Raccoons, I  hear a really, really smart. They're very clever is what it is. They're clever. They  get into anything. No matter what kind of garbage pill you have, uh, they, they get in  it. And my garbage is usually spilled all over the side of the house. You're going to  have to throw your house away. You know that. No. If you fucking threw a couch away because  of a lousy little booger from a little kid, I think you, you might have to throw the entire  house away now. Well, it's, it's not, it's not that bad. It's being worked on. It's being 
[00:08:00]  fixed. It's being cleaned. Everything's being done. I, I just, I got to get rid of  these. So I, I told people I had, uh, uh, raccoons in my house. Raccoons. Raccoons. Yeah.  I used an apostrophe. Raccoons. And of course they made all types of inappropriate jokes on  Twitter about that. Did that make you happy? Uh, yes, it kind of did. Let's be honest with  each other. That made you really happy. But I, but I said, I go, look, let, all right, 
[00:08:30]  let the obvious jokes begin to try to weed out the, the more obvious ones. But some  people came up with some clever, uh, clever little jokes. I was surprised. Yeah, that  was, um, that was great having the exterminator over. And the only reason they found that is  because the AC guys were up there fixing my bedroom air conditioner and they discovered  all this. And yeah, they said, uh, you've got a raccoon problem. I'm like, wait, exterminator  column. Wait. Uh, yeah, you had a, you were saying you had an AC problem yesterday. I don't 
[00:09:00]  know if you said that on the air. So maybe the raccoons caused that. Um, no, that was  caused by a blocked, uh, coil. Just a coincidence. Yeah. It froze up. You sure it wasn't the raccoons  just peeing on everything? Just pissing on my air conditioning unit. No, I think I would  have smelled that coming out of the unit. It was a frozen coil and, uh, the, the fan was  blowing and had nowhere to send the air. Right. So the, uh, fan got overheated and burnt out  because I kind of smelled something burning. Hmm. Uh, let's go to Bob on Long Island. Bobby. 
[00:09:30]  Hey there, Bab. You got something on this for Anthony? Yeah. Well, anybody that, uh, any  exterminator that comes to your house without a ladder on the truck is not a true nuisance  wildlife guy that's going to do this job right. He, uh, he did have a ladder. He didn't have  a tall enough ladder. Didn't have a tall, well, I, with the compound, I doubt he would.  It's very tall. I have a, uh, I like the high ground. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, you know, 
[00:10:00]  that addict needs to, needs to have the raccoons exterminated. And if he told you they're not  in there during the day, he sees these wrong because that's what they do during the day.  They, they stay in the attics and, uh, maybe they're not, maybe that added my attic during  the day. But that's what's confusing. I mean, most raccoons, you know,  hanged tight during the day. I've been up there during the day, uh, in that attic and  Mary saw, uh, anything. And, and you have a empty attic, right? Yeah. It's just the AC 
[00:10:30]  units. Is there any like holes or any other fucking little things in the attic they could  be going into? Radio females. Huh? Bad radio females. Oh. No. See them out there. Oh, the  little raccoon. Leave them alone. Hey, there's a hole up here. Now the, uh, the, I, I didn't  see anything, no holes, no nothing. So they're just not there. I don't know how the fuck they're  getting in at this point, but, uh, well, if, uh, you don't, you know, if you don't get  them, he doesn't get them. Um, I can leave my number, you know, when I get off the line 
[00:11:00]  and, uh, we can get over there and do this. Let's say hi to Larry and Yonkers. I'm trying  to cock block my exterminator. Larry! Larry! What's going on, guys? What's up, Larry? I had  a serious problem with raccoons this time last year, and here's how you do it, guys.  The first thing is the bait in trap. Raccoons' very favorite bait is marshmallows. Yeah. Skunks  won't touch marshmallows. Possible won't touch marshmallows. You narrowed down your kill to  your raccoon. Well, there are marshmallows in my trap. Oh, so you knew that already. Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Here's what you gotta do. You gotta get a 55-gallon drum, fill the water, put it in the backyard,  have a hard trap, catch the raccoon, drop them in the drum for five minutes, you drown them,  you put them in a garbage bag, and you throw them in a local dumpster. Nobody answers,  no questions, no smell, no tell. You're a fucking serial killer.  Some tell me he does this with hookers. No kidding. That's how it begins. They're, they're,  they got rabies, and they're in your attic, you sit to have a hard trap. Stabies? You go,  yeah, you go at nighttime, drop them in the bucket, five minutes, the bubbles come up, and 
[00:12:00]  they're smart little fuckers. They know you're gonna drown them. Dude, even when I had a killer.  They know you're gonna drown them. They know you're gonna drown them. Even when I  had to kill mice with the electric trap, I was really bothered by that every morning.  Let me tell you something. I can't kill things. Let me tell you something, my friend. I don't  have it in me to look at a raccoon in the, in his little masked face and dunk him in water  to drown him. For five minutes. I really look, I come off like a, an insufferable prick, but 
[00:12:30]  I could never do that. Yeah, the raccoons are always the cute ones in those animated cartoons,  you know? No, you can't. These liberal bashes won't do it. It's not about being liberal.  It's about being a fucking human being. A lot of people can't just fucking drown a raccoon.  This guy might be right, though. I have the rest of your solution for you. Want to keep  him away? You get a dead one, you dismember the body, you leave body parts around the compound,  you see that? They will not come back. I love this guy. Hey, guy, I had little kids. I don't 
[00:13:00]  want to wrap raccoons around with little kids. We had a problem. All right. What do you do if  they misbehave? Drown them in a fucking drum? Okay, man. I understand that's how you took care  of them, sir. But what I'm trying to say is the average person, I don't think, could do what you  just described. But Anthony's not the average person. He's a very unique person. No, I don't think  Anthony could fucking drown animals. I could never do that. He could do a lot of weird  shit, but he's not that guy that will go out there and drown animals. I'm a school teacher,  and I love kids, and I love animals. But raccoons are a hazard around the house. Revolving 
[00:13:30]  Monk wants to know if this is Colonel Kurtz on the phone. I do want to know what the exterminator  is going to do when they catch the raccoons in the trap, though. Where do they let the raccoons  go? It's Long Island. In the country. There's no country on Long Island. The guy's going to  drive him upstate. I don't know what they do with him. No, you have to dismember one  and leave it around the car. We heard you, Larry. It's very disturbing for six fucking  20 in the morning. No one's going to do that, Larry. No. No one's going to do that. No one 
[00:14:00]  is cutting up a raccoon and leaving body parts strewn about the yard. A pile of baby raccoon  arms. If I had one division of men like that, a raccoon problem would be over here very quickly.  Doesn't the raccoon laugh? Doesn't the body parts horrify the kids when they're walking  around your house? No, we don't do that here because we're in Westchester. It's too small  of an area. But that's what they do in Dutchess County. Put a raccoon head on a pike in front 
[00:14:30]  of the house. A tail, a foot, you know, something like that. They know. They're very smart.  They recognize those body parts. Yeah. Larry, what do you do for a living? I'm a school teacher.  You did say that. I'm sorry. I don't blame you then. You have to deal with those little  fuckers every day. You probably have to get a little of that anger out at home.  Have you ever cut off a little raccoon foot, Larry?  No, no. I'm an automotive teacher. I have kids that want to be there.  All right, Larry. It was a dumb little joke. All right? We relax.  Larry's a weirdo. Larry's wound very tight. You're a weirdo. 
[00:15:00]  It wasn't supposed to bring down the house. It was just supposed to be a quick little  chuckle. Get a hold of yourself. Yeah, you really are panicking, Larry.  All right, Larry. Anything else? No, that's it, guys. Have a great day.  All right. Larry from Yonkers. That's a fine phone call, though.  Larry's a creep. That's a fine phone call.  I mean, right now, Larry's a raging hard-on.  Just thinking of those little fucking raccoon body parts all over.  Dicing up raccoons. Yeah, raccoon feet.  Let's go to Stryker. Stryker.  Maybe he can help. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, Anthony, I'm just hoping that you don't catch Opie in that trap with the marshmallow.  Oh, now. Like he'd try to pick him up with his hiney.  All right. I did pick up marshmallows with my hiney.  What homosexual activity have you done, Stryker?  None.  Well, I mean, you had to have done something like picking up marshmallows with your ass.  No, I haven't.  Nothing, huh?  Nothing. I can honestly say that, yeah, that's a one-way route. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, I see jokes being made about Larry here.  Yeah.  It rubs the lotion on its pelt. It does this whenever it's told.  Larry wants to drown raccoons.  Put the fuck a raccoon in the 55-gallon troll.  Thank you, Stryker.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Hey, Anthony, you know, raccoons like alcohol, too.  You know, maybe you have to keep them around. They could party with you.  Oh, shit. Maybe that's it. 
[00:16:30]  They're getting in my tap.  That's fine to be where they're at during the day.  Better check on your outflow there of...  Oh, my God.  All right. Thank you, Stryker. Jesus.  Steve in South Carolina. Steve.  Oh, God.  Yo.  Tell them about the raccoon, Larry.  See, everyone's very excited that you have raccoons, Anthony.  Yes, they're very excited.  They all want to help on the phone.  What did you say?  They love using the coon line.  Yes, yeah.  They love saying, I have a coon problem.  Because raccoons, especially down south, they just call it going coon hunting or something like that. 
[00:17:00]  And they made a lot of jokes, a lot of inappropriate jokes on the Twitter, on the Twitter.  Why'd you call them a mask face? Because their little eyes?  Yeah, they have a little mask.  Oh.  They wear a little mask. They're like little bandits.  And their little hands work like hands.  They open up little things and they pick it up and they eat.  Oh, they're adorable if they're not in my house.  If I come in the house, though, and I'm confronted with a raccoon, I will have to have a person come over to seal up holes that will be in my floor and ceiling. 
[00:17:30]  Because I just will start unloading on it with a firearm in my house.  I hope there's one actually pissing on the fucking trigger of your 50 cal.  Here, there's a picture of a raccoon fucking the family dog.  The family dog.  Are you kidding me?  They will do this.  I didn't know that.  They're that aggressive?  They'll go after your family pets.  Yes.  How humiliating for the dog.  That is, really.  Poor little beagle. 
[00:18:00]  He's supposed to protect the house.  And he's getting fucked by the raccoon.  He's taking it in the ass.  That one with his teeth, baring his teeth.  Wow.  Fuck.  Would you drown a possum, though?  Because the possum isn't as cute.  No, they don't wear little masks.  They got that weird mouth.  They're like, grr, grr, and their teeth.  The thing's always, like, splattered in the road.  And their mouth is always, brr, just all busted up.  Yeah, look at that.  That's a possum?  Yeah, that's a possum. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, that possum is fucking...  Do they bite?  Oh, yeah.  What do you think?  Look at those fucking teeth.  What do you think they do with those?  If you come across a possum that's, like, being...  Wipe it off.  All animals bite.  You see little possums following them?  You stay the fuck away, because they really are defensive of their little children.  They'll turn around and...  They hiss.  They make a weird...  Hissing sound possums.  They're very frightening. 
[00:19:00]  Do they charge you, or they just...  They will, if you get too close to their little children.  This weekend, Anthony won.  Congratulations.  Raccoons, zero.  You caught a raccoon, did you?  Caught me a raccoon.  I gotta make believe I didn't see the picture.  Yeah, I know.  The picture was amazing.  He set up the raccoon traps in his backyard, and guess what?  He got one.  Look at the little guy. 
[00:19:30]  Isn't he adorable?  Do you put your finger through and go, like, chuk-a-chuk on his chin?  No.  Let me tell you what I did.  I went close with the camera to try to get a close picture of him, and he scared me.  Did he?  Because he made a funny, funny sound.  But wasn't he in the cage?  Yeah.  But it still scared you?  Dude, it scared me 20 times each time I tried to get close to the cage.  Do you have video?  Yeah.  Okay.  Here's some sound from him.  Let me see if I could... 
[00:20:00]  Look at the cute raccoon.  Look how cute he is.  Watch this.  Listen to the sound.  Hi.  Fuck that.  I pulled back so fast.  I was like, ah!  Even though he's in a cage, right?  And there's the shot that makes PETA mad. 
[00:20:30]  Is PETA on your case?  A couple of people actually were...  A couple of PETA people?  Thought I was actually going to pull the trigger.  Really?  Yeah.  He's going to pull the trigger on a .50 cal that's literally six to eight inches away from  a raccoon's face.  Away from his little face.  The funny thing is, he's looking directly into the barrel.  It would be so funny, though, if that cage door just opened up, how fast you would run.  I know!  How worthless that gun would be.  It'd just be a stick for him.  That'd be girl running.  It'd be a stick for him to run on and get to your eyes faster. 
[00:21:00]  Dude, that's a pretty good-sized raccoon.  Yeah, yeah.  He was a big guy.  He's cute, though.  They're adorable.  They got little masks on, like a little criminal.  Stop stealing things, guys.  No, stop.  He must have...  When I saw him the next day, because he must have been caught overnight, the cage spun  around 180 degrees from where it was.  Oh, yeah.  So he must have been losing his fucking mind in there for a while.  By this point, he was plum tuckered out.  Because when I saw him, he was laying down kind of in a little circle with his little 
[00:21:30]  hand over his eyes.  Like, oh, God, you got me.  He was all bumming.  So what finally happened from there?  You have him in a cage.  Now, where do you release him?  In the next-door neighbor's basement, just for shenanigans.  The exterminator comes and drives him to some happy place very far away.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, they do.  It's a happy place, raccoon place, very far away.  Do they kill him?  What do you think? 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  You think the exterminator's really, you know, spending an afternoon to do the right  thing?  They took Mr. Jangle down to the raccoon circus down there in Florida.  And if you're an exterminator, I bet you there's a lot of laws you have to follow that  you can't just be letting raccoons you catch loose somewhere else on Long Island.  In the woods, I mean.  That thing is dead.  Here's the only reason I think he's an upstanding guy and pays attention to the laws.  Well, did you ask him?  Because you're not allowed to kill him.  Did you ask him?  No.  I don't want to know what's going to happen to this fucking thing. 
[00:22:30]  He's dead.  He's cute.  The raccoon's dead.  But here's the reason why.  It's a lot easier that way.  They've gotten into my attic at some point.  Right.  He didn't put the traps in the attic because then the raccoon can go in, get stuck in the  trap, and the attic gets 130 degrees, and the raccoon dies.  So he...  And then your house stinks.  He doesn't want to go up there and get it out of a stinky house.  Well, not the next day.  It's not going to stink the next day, but he'd be dead.  So he takes him to the Happy Raccoon Release Grounds very far away in the country. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I wonder if there's a place in the woods where they do take him, where they're just not  going to get back to people.  Why would they do that?  Because they might have to buy law.  If they have to buy law, you're not going to lose your business over it.  Like, it might be a thing they have to do.  All I hope is that he dropped him off.  What do you think the guy did with the raccoon?  I hope he dropped him off south of the expressway.  Probably south of the fucking parkway.  Problem isn't...  And south of a lot of other roads where he would get squished trying to get back to  my house.  I think we have a pretty big radio show.  Come on, exterminators. 
[00:23:30]  Tell me what happens to the raccoons.  We're going to hear a bunch of stories about...  Tell me about the raccoons and where you take them.  Here it is.  I don't think there's anywhere you can take them on Long Island legally.  Dude, here's what happens.  I was an exterminator.  My whole family exterminates, and we're exterminators.  Take the trap.  There's a 55-gallon drum full of water behind our fucking shop, and we just lower the trap  in there, and wait, you know, five, ten minutes, lift it up, and that's it.  He's gone. 
[00:24:00]  We fucking put him in a ditch and bury him.  Couldn't be helped.  Couldn't be helped.  I think your raccoon is dead, Ant.  And it's over, and that's that.  Yeah.  Frank in New York, what does the word exterminate mean?  Relocate.  They relocated the little guy.  I called a relocator.  Oh, sweetie.  He's so cute.  I don't want anything bad to have happened to him.  I know.  You could see, like, a Hollywood star playing his voice.  Yeah, I know.  Look at his little eyes. 
[00:24:30]  He's got the little mask on.  Oh, my God.  Let me go.  Oh, look at him.  You really think that raccoon is still alive?  Yes, he's fine.  He was not happy to see you.  No.  Where on Long Island do they take the raccoons?  They take them out to the Pine Barrens.  I got people.  Nashville isn't going to help me, Chris.  Chris in Nashville.  Go ahead.  Yeah, we had a service.  I'm getting some raccoons off of our farm, and they, quote, unquote, relocated them.  About two weeks later, we found them because my wife said she loves animals. 
[00:25:00]  Two weeks later, we found out they relocated them to a dog training facility to be used  to train coon dogs to hunt.  See, that's where the raccoons go, Ant.  Well, that's down there.  There's not much coon hunting going on here.  You're personally responsible for the death of a raccoon.  No.  Hope you feel good about yourself.  A guy that loses his mind when he sees little kittens on TV.  I know I do.  And tell me you're not losing your mind over the cute raccoon.  I was sitting on the stoop there next to the cage just talking to him until the exterminator 
[00:25:30]  got there.  Nice buzz.  I was like, hi, little guy.  Nice buzz.  I was...  Jesus.  Well, I had a couple of beers, but I was talking to him.  It was fun.  I was like, don't worry.  Did you feed him a little...  You're okay, little guy.  You feed him little treats?  No, I wasn't getting near him because he made that rrrr sound.  I wonder what he would have done if you gave him a little treat to eat.  He would fucking bite my fingers and I'd have rabies.  No, if you just slipped into the cage.  I don't mean...  Oh.  Well, there are little treats in there for him.  They're little marshmallows.  That's the bait.  They like marshmallows? 
[00:26:00]  Marshmallows and peanut butter.  I love marshmallows.  And then some big meaty bone was in there.  Look, E-Rock didn't get caught in there.  Somehow, E-Rock's in my trap.  Just his little fat head.  Yeah, that's funny.  The noise it made, though.  Wow.  Yeah, it barked.  It did that like three times and every time I pulled away, like a fairy...  I got way too close to a raccoon or rat once.  You should hear what a rat could sound like when it feels like it's trapped.  Yeah, like these animals make these weird noises. 
[00:26:30]  Fuck out of you.  Yeah, they come up with these noises that you just...  You think they're silent animals.  And then they're barking at you.  Wah!  You know what?  I want to know where the raccoons go on Long Island because we all know Long Island.  There's not many spots left where you can just release raccoons.  Way out east.  The Pine Barrens.  So you think your guy is going to waste a half a day of work to bring raccoons into...  Maybe he's got a bunch of raccoons from a bunch of other houses and he takes them out  there and goes, okay.  And what do you think?  Bye-bye. 
[00:27:00]  Bye-bye.  You're playing this perfectly.  But really, what do you think happens to these poor things?  I honestly...  Think they release them somewhere?  You want an honest answer?  Yes.  I don't know.  I just don't know.  Why don't you call him and ask him?  But I...  But he said he releases them.  Like, I already asked him.  But where does he release them?  I didn't ask, but I guess I'll ask.  And if he's releasing the raccoons in the same area, there's going to be a lot of raccoons  in this one area.  Hopefully you're making a lot more fucking raccoons.  My front yard.  So he has something to do next.  We can come back and recatch it. 
[00:27:30]  You should have read the fine print.  We catch the raccoon and release it in your front yard.  Or in your toilet until he bites out your asshole and balls.  And he calls his brother the doctor.  Is this an angry raccoon getting released?  For free.  Are we going outside of the gate?  Yeah.  This might be a good idea.  Are there a raccoon being released?  Yes.  Okay.  He's going to just open the cage.  Oh, fuck.  What's going to happen?  30,000 views.  Something happens.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Open it up to the little raccoon trap. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  He's ready to...  This one.  This looks a lot like your raccoon.  Yeah, he does.  Wait a minute.  Maybe it's mine.  Dump him out.  What the fuck was that?  What the fuck was that?  What the hell was that?  Raccoon's still in the cage.  Come on, homie.  Go.  Come on, back up.  Dumb animal.  No, turn around, asshole. 
[00:28:30]  Chip it up.  Oh, my God.  Fuck that.  He's all mad.  They make piggy noises.  Oh, there he goes.  He just ran off.  He was a little angry at first.  He ran into a tree.  He was climbing a tree.  He ain't going to sit there and duke it out.  No.  It's a fucking raccoon.  So, I don't know what happens to him, but I assume he takes him somewhere and lets him  go to live out his little raccoon life.  You don't even want to know where the raccoons go.  Why? 
[00:29:00]  Phone calls are brutal.  Are they?  Yes.  I don't like the thinking.  This guy used to be a exterminator.  I knew this story.  Ed in Pennsylvania.  Ed.  How's it going?  Hey.  Yeah.  I used to trap raccoons and all that other fun, every other animal.  What we used to do was we trap them and people would ask.  We'd say, oh, yeah, we let them free.  And by a state wall here in Pennsylvania, they have to be put down because you can't  put, say, that raccoon had rabies. 
[00:29:30]  Now you're transporting the rabies virus to a different part of your state or county.  So, we used to have a CO2 canister that we used to have to put them in.  And then we'd turn it on nice and slow.  And they would just freeze.  And we'd remove them from there after we'd come out of the trap.  That's pretty much what we do.  Yeah.  I don't think you...  You'd freeze them with CO2?  Yeah, because we used to have a 55-gallon drone with the water.  Jesus.  But the Humane Services said that it was inhumane to put them in to dunk them. 
[00:30:00]  So, we had to go to a little gas chamber for them.  So, Ant's little raccoon is now dead, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  He's pretty much...  Oh, Ant.  No.  Oh, Ant.  How do you live with yourself?  I don't want to...  The guy just wanted some marshmallows.  How do you live with yourself?  A little fellow wanted a marshmallow.  I was chatting with him.  You know, he probably thought you'd be okay.  If your exterminator was a smart guy, I know where you were joking about putting it in your  front yard, but I would release it in the neighborhood a few houses down.  You know how much repeat business you would get in the neighborhood? 
[00:30:30]  Well, that's true.  All for the same fucking raccoon?  I never thought about that.  Knowing, like, neighbors in general talks also, like, I fucking got a raccoon.  Really?  Well, I called this guy.  Yeah, call this guy.  I got a number.  He just keeps...  And he just...  It's the same raccoon.  Just...  It's his pet.  Right.  He, like, knows where to tell it to go to certain places.  Just keeps dumping it two houses down, two houses down.  Hey, wait.  Can we...  Danny has angry raccoon, a vicious...  I want to hear...  Can you hear it?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  It just...  Or just ants noise.  It does make, like, these piggy sounds.  It's very strange.  Yes.  Hello.  You want these DVDs?  You guys trying to feed it on a...  Something on a sticks of meat.  Dummy.  Oh.  Jesus.  Can you imagine?  Fuck that.  Wow.  Wow, yeah.  That's kind of a... 
[00:31:30]  Is that what you heard?  Snorting.  New York.  Kind of a...  Kind of a bark.  You guys just taunting it.  Aw, look at his little face.  Oh, shit.  That will fuck you up.  Yeah.  And they got them little sharp teeth.  Like a fucking serrated knife.  You would...  That thing would just lay right into you.  That would hurt so much.  Oh.  And you know how infected it would get?  Even if it doesn't have rabies. 
[00:32:00]  It would get so fucking infected.  Look at that.  I think raccoon teeth are dirty.  Oh, they're filthy.  Just eating rotting garbage all day.  Licking his raccoon balls.  Yeah, his dirty raccoon asshole.  Has raccoon shit in it?  Oh, it's just garbage coming out of his ass.  Caked with raccoon duty.  I would hate to get raccoon duty in my eyelashes.  Why would that happen ever?  It would be so hard to blink it out.  Let's say hi to Chris in Miami.  Chris. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, hello.  I just want to say I'm surprised that Anthony is so humane to the raccoon.  Anthony loves cute animals, man.  He can't get enough of them.  Wait, why are you surprised he's humane to the raccoon?  Well, I just figured that he wouldn't like them because they're filthy animals.  All they do is steal and bring out the property value.  What is property value?  Property value.  I'm sorry.  I have a problem in my mouth.  What's wrong with your teeth? 
[00:33:00]  What's wrong with your mouth, sir?  Nothing.  I think he was hoping no one would notice.  You have a weird tongue?  I'm sorry.  No, it's okay, man.  What's wrong with your tongue?  I'm apologizing.  What's wrong with your tongue, sir?  No, nothing.  I just bite it down a lot by accident and it hurts.  Do you have a big tongue?  Is that what it is, sir?  Are you a big-tongued man?  Hello?  Yes.  It can hurt your ears, too? 
[00:33:30]  We have this guy really apologizing for his own tongue.  He's like, I'm sorry.  He should say he's sorry.  That's why I have to contribute to the show.  I'm sorry I bring the show down.  Oh, the poor guy.  I feel worse for you than my right.  Yeah.  Hey, John Merrick tongue, what's the matter with it?  Oh, come on.  Hey, John Merrick.  I thought he was...  I just thought he was fucking Cuban or something.  It's a giant tongue.  I am Cuban, but...  Oh, very good.  All right.  Good call.  Yeah, it's just that... 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, but normal Cuban people don't talk like me, so...  No, I just thought it was your accent, but Jimmy noticed that it was your big fucking  tongue.  Yeah, well, you know, the guy mentioned that it was his thick, freakish tongue.  Yeah.  And what's the world's known?  Why do you bite down on it so much?  Yeah, stop doing that.  You hungry?  No, it's just my accent.  Every once in a while, I'd bite down on the inside of my mouth, but...  It's just giant is what it is.  You can't keep from biting it.  Try biting your own tongue right now.  It's not easy.  I mean, you can, you know, do it on purpose, but I mean...  I'll just do this.  Like Duval. 
[00:34:30]  Duval and Sling Blade.  I'm the boy named Carl.  I'll punch you out, boys.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry that we had to point out your tongue thing.  Yeah, sorry about that.  Sorry God did it to you.  As you should.  Thank you very much.  All right.  All right.  Take it easy, big tongue show owner.  All right.  Let him do it.  Jesus.  All right.  BTS.  All right.  Go back to fucking your day job, which is licking 400 stamps at a time. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Fucking human frog.  Go back to catching lots of flies at once.  Poor guy.  All right.  Hey, Gene Simmons.  Thanks for calling in.  Appreciate it.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock and the show's off.  So we're playing worst of.  That's just what we do.  This bit involves Club Soda Kenny and Cosmo Radio. 
[00:35:30]  It's more of Cosmo Radio's issue with Club Soda Kenny.  Taylor, the host of the morning show there, noticed for a long time Kenny would follow Opie and Anthony to the bathroom, to the kitchen, wherever they were going.  And she said on the air she'd like to have a bodyguard of her own.  So we hear about it, we get involved, we find out what's going on.  And by the way, follow Club Soda Kenny on Facebook, at Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  There you go.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Cosmo Radio was talking about us, but now we've got to wait to get permission to play their audio or something. 
[00:36:00]  Oh.  Just let us play whatever audio we want.  I don't care if another channel plays our audio.  Who cares?  You want to take what we do and do something with it?  Go for it.  Go!  But if another channel's going to talk about us, we should be able to play the audio immediately.  Just makes for good radio.  Exactly.  I want to know what they were saying.  I think a few corporate emails should go around and some people should have to talk meeting maybe. 
[00:36:30]  We have to get permission from the guy who's in charge of Cosmo Radio.  Is he the same guy that we trashed his sweater and trumpeteer thing?  Yes.  This is the same guy who said, no way you can't have the big studio for the homeless talent show.  And then, which we got.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did we trash his sweater show?  Yeah, you really did.  What was it again?  The Christmas sweater show?  It was the Christmas sweater fashion show.  Fashion show.  With trumpeteers?  With trumpeteers.  It was something they promoted for months. 
[00:37:00]  And within one day, you completely.  Hey, it's something they wanted to do.  And, you know, I feel bad that we did that.  But we had to have that venue.  Even with the homeless in there, our show stunk less than theirs would have.  That trumpeteer happening.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm not saying they do a bad show.  Pleasant dreams.  Nobody wants to hear trumpeteering.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, their show may be very good.  Fuck, is this a great name?  Trumpeteering is never good.  So what were they saying on Cosmo Radio? 
[00:37:30]  Something about Kenny?  Yeah, well, they saw Opie and Kenny walking.  I guess I see them walking a lot because their studio is kind of near where Opie goes.  Connected at the hip.  You do.  But they described Kenny as being Opie's bodyguard.  Yeah.  Kenny walks when Jimmy's around and when Anthony...  Anthony rarely walks around the place.  But Kenny just walks with us because we talked to him.  No, they said he's your bodyguard.  And that...  Protecting me from what around here?  Well, as they said, they were surprised because this was such a secure area that you would 
[00:38:00]  need a bodyguard.  One of the girls said that they wanted a bodyguard like Kenny, but then the rest of the show  pointed out and had a good laugh at how poorly a job of guarding a body Kenny must do.  Wow.  As he's so slow and lurch-like that he certainly couldn't protect anyone from an attack.  Like a lumbering beast?  Like a zombie?  You could just run away from him?  Like a moronic zombie.  Oh, a moron zombie.  Like a stupid, big, know-nothing. 
[00:38:30]  A galoot.  Yeah.  A big galoot.  A hulking...  Yeah.  ...nothing.  Just a mass of waste of space.  Uselessness.  Yeah.  Just a pile of meat with eyes.  Yeah.  Over six feet of idiocy.  Yeah.  Kenny, would you like to respond?  Now, Kenny, this is your forte.  This is now...  You take this seriously because you are a security man. 
[00:39:00]  I will give my life for you guys.  See?  Just like the bodyguard.  It's like the Secret Service, only stupid.  It's funny that you say Secret Service because you know how Kenny has the radio monitor in  his ears.  Oh, yeah.  So he can hear what's going on on the show.  Yep.  They mocked that and said, he has an earpiece in his ear.  It's surely just a regular radio that he wears to try to look important.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Does this make you feel bad?  The slow and oafish and stupid stuff. 
[00:39:30]  Oafish is a good word.  Oh.  Do they use oafish or are you just pumping it up a little bit?  Somebody might have written it.  Wow.  Now, this is something that I don't agree with at all.  I think Kenny is very proficient in helping everybody out, protection.  I feel very secure when I'm with Kenny.  Proficiency is different than intelligence.  Exactly.  You don't have to be smart to be good at, you know. 
[00:40:00]  You have what is called instincts.  Right.  Common sense.  Yeah, well, slow down.  Well.  Instincts.  Like, if there's something going on, Kenny can sense it.  Like shenanigans.  He can look around.  But then again, so could a big, dumb animal.  That's true.  You know, even a zebra at a watering hole knows when the lions are around.  They poke their head up, but they are just stupid animals.  Yeah.  So you're like a zebra. 
[00:40:30]  I don't got stripes, but I am dumb.  You're a lot more to us than that.  You're a lot more than a blithering lummich.  Yes.  They also, I guess their office is near Ron and Fez's office upstairs.  Oh, really?  And the guy said, there's some weirdo in the office next to us who some days he wears  a full toupee and some days not.  Oh, no.  They don't even know it's a bit.  No, they said.  They have no idea it's a bit.  It says bits. 
[00:41:00]  They don't know why he's doing it unless it's for something.  Why would they know what good radio is?  They thought maybe he's got four months left to live.  Those people are bad neighbors.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody else is neighborly.  I'm surprised.  Ladies and gentlemen, Troy Kwan running down the hall.  This could be some breaking news.  Oh, here we go.  This is the audio?  Yeah.  We got permission?  Yep.  Thank you, Craig Schwab, who we used to work with.  Thank you.  Remember Craig?  We even get along with Shade 45. 
[00:41:30]  We get along with everybody.  Out Q.  No, not everybody.  The monster steward chicks.  Grumpy old man that has to take a dump every time I'm in there.  There's always exceptions.  But for the most part, the engineers.  Yeah.  All right.  You ready to hear this Cosmo radio thing?  I am so ready.  Wait a second.  So, Opie has a bodyguard?  He's not a bodyguard.  There's no context to it either.  They obviously just saw you walking by and out of nowhere they were talking about people 
[00:42:00]  who work here.  And then...  I like this chick's voice, by the way.  I've heard her before.  That's that raspy kind of...  I like that raspy voice.  I just woke up.  I like that voice.  What does she look like, Kenny?  I wouldn't know these people if I tripped over them.  They're bad neighbors.  Kenny.  Yeah, that's that raspy kind of fucking...  I heard her before.  I kind of like her voice.  Morning voice.  That's good. 
[00:42:30]  I need some of my throat yogurt.  Okay.  Kenny, you want to go on their show and explain what you do for us?  Because they're a little confused.  No, fuck them.  You want to hear Club Soda Kenny, you hear him exclusively on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  I like that.  I see the loyalties there.  He's like a big dumb dog.  Sam, he's very loyal.  Can you bring him in there, though?  That would be kind of fun.  Oh, God.  I mean...  Look at poor Sam.  Physically, I probably could.  I've heard this girl.  I think she'll play along with us.  I really do.  Is she the one that had the sweater thing going on? 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  This is, I think, the same girl who was very upset when we went down to their studio last  time.  Wait a second.  So, Opie has a bodyguard?  He's not a bodyguard.  I think he is.  He wears, like, a weird...  Yeah, like, he's in the...  He's, like, in the...  It must be, like, a radio that he's listening to.  Yeah.  He might be a driver or something.  I'm not...  Then why is he with him all the time?  No, I think it's, like...  Driver stays in car.  Yeah.  I think it's, like, a regular radio that he's just listening to.  It's, like, a transistor radio that he's making himself look important by having...  Is that what he is?  He looks like Secret Service. 
[00:43:30]  For real.  Huge Secret Service.  Definitely not Secret Service.  Bell Tower of Secret Service.  Except he's not.  I want a bodyguard.  Uh, hello.  I want to fire him.  You want that bodyguard?  You're firing me?  Yeah, I think I want him.  Can I borrow him from Opie?  Do you think he would let me borrow his bodyguard for the day?  Get that chick in here.  Yeah, now we got it open.  Now we got an open invitation to go in there, because she asked a question.  So, Kenny, we're certainly going to give you up to the Cosmo radio broad.  You could be her bodyguard.  Yeah, but we got to do it on our turf. 
[00:44:00]  So I'm protected.  It's like the movie bodyguard.  Yeah.  You could sweep her off her feet.  It's true.  I don't want to try...  I like this broad.  I don't know much about her.  I've heard her show a few times.  Yeah, but get her in here.  I'm scared to go in there.  See what she looks like.  Can someone see what she looks like?  Snap a picture.  Snap a pic.  Get a pic.  Get a pic.  Do they have any pictures on the website?  Oh, that's a good point.  Wake up with Taylor.  What?  For the day?  You don't want that bodyguard.  I have lots to do today.  I could use some assistance. 
[00:44:30]  He could probably carry me around on his shoulders all day, too.  That guy walks around...  At the same time in cabs?  He walks around so slow.  I think even if you were accosted by the crazy man this morning, that guy wouldn't even...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Slow moving.  Yeah, yeah.  What am I rushing for?  I've got four hours to kill around here.  Exactly.  Where are you running to?  Yeah, what am I rushing for?  Why would...  Unless something's going on.  I don't get the whole slow moving thing.  Unless there's a code blue...  Right.  Where...  What is he...  Should he be running back and forth everywhere? 
[00:45:00]  Look, man.  We take our breaks.  I usually find Kenny and we just talk.  We just talk.  Yeah, we exchange pleasantries.  Yeah, we just kill...  All we're doing is killing a little time in between breaks.  Which is which, uh...  There, Dan.  Well, the show's called Wake Up with Taylor.  Yeah.  And I'm pretty sure that this broad here on the left is Taylor.  It's Taylor.  They're both fantastic.  And then...  I don't know who that is.  I've never seen these broads either, so I don't know.  I couldn't tell you.  I haven't seen her walk in the hallways or anything. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I think they just go upstairs.  Can you go down that picture a little bit?  Oh.  I don't mean sideways.  Size-wise.  I just mean, yeah, yeah, go up.  And then just scroll down.  That's the whole thing.  Yeah, but make it bigger.  I'd give either one of them a smooch around.  Okay, now scroll down.  Okay.  I just want to see a little...  I see an arch there.  Yeah, she's got some going on.  There's some...  Is she the one with the raspy voice?  The mean more voice?  You know what?  She's all right, man. 
[00:46:00]  I ain't gonna complain.  Most women broadcasting are pigs.  I ain't gonna complain about that.  But this one is all right.  She's a looker.  There's not many lookers in broadcasting.  That's all right.  Right?  Get her in here.  What do you want to do to her, guys?  I think we should get her in here and talk.  Talk it out?  Well, I...  But I think we should sit fucking Kenny in the corner with a hat with a propeller on  it.  And make him hold like a spirally lollipop while we interview her.  Could we just do that? 
[00:46:30]  Or a sideways police hat and an ice cream cone like he's lost.  Any more images?  Those are two really good ones.  Poor little Kenny.  Yeah.  I'm not trying to offend anyone.  I'm saying he moves around very slowly.  I'm protecting you, friend.  He is protecting you.  He's protecting you.  I know.  But I don't mean anything other than he moves very slowly like a big lurch.  Right.  I knew that.  Yes.  He's just a slow-moving guy.  It's got to be hard to move all that weight around.  I don't think he would have been able to help you. 
[00:47:00]  You don't think he'd be able to help me?  I don't think he's a very effective bodyguard.  No.  Yeah.  Leave her alone.  Right.  Exactly.  By the time he finishes his sentence, the guy's like pummeling me.  Yeah.  It's the Chris Harrison bodyguard.  Boring.  Leave her.  Boring.  Does Howard Stern have bodyguards?  He has security.  Same thing, right?  He's got Ronnie, his limo driver and stuff.  I mean, that's it. 
[00:47:30]  I've never seen Ronnie.  Is he a big guy?  No.  You know Ronnie.  No, I don't.  I know of him.  I don't know him.  Well, I saw one picture one time because of something that we can't talk about.  But that's all.  Oh, yeah.  Well, no.  But there's secret entrances and stuff.  He just bounces in and out.  And there's security all over the place.  I don't necessarily think...  I'm saying that's cool.  Like, he doesn't need...  Like, he's Howard Stern.  And he doesn't even have a bodyguard?  No.  I mean, he's protected.  It's not like he's out in the open a lot.  He has a security team that works here. 
[00:48:00]  And probably one that works in his building.  And that's probably the end of it, right?  Like, he doesn't have a bodyguard with him when he goes to restaurants with Beth.  No.  That would be...  That would be...  Wow.  Ronnie.  The banality of this conversation is mind-boggling.  Yeah.  He doesn't have a bodyguard because he has, like, a labyrinth.  A labyrinth?  Sirius XM gave him a labyrinth.  A labyrinth to get in and out of this place.  We've been here nine months, I think, right?  In this building.  Nine glorious months, O.  Glorious, Jimmy.  Glorious! 
[00:48:30]  And we haven't seen him once.  Not a once.  He's got a labyrinth.  We don't even know how he gets in and out at this point.  No clue.  Ronnie does...  I would assume that if something were to go down or something...  Yeah, but Ronnie's not, like, sitting in the booth with them, or is he?  No.  No.  You mean the radio booth?  I mean, like, a booth in a restaurant.  No.  Sorry, that was totally unexplained.  Oh, like, no, no.  I don't think he...  No.  No.  No, he lives...  He's a regular.  But this guy follows Opie around in the studio, in the hallways of Sirius, which we're completely 
[00:49:00]  protected because we have security everywhere.  Yeah, I don't know what that guy does.  He just stands around and just kind of, like, mopes and walks.  Eats breakfast every day.  I want a mopa.  I'm jealous.  I want to get me one of those.  Be patient.  I want a broken bag, and I want him.  No, neither of those guys had mopers around them when they were, you know, they were youngins.  You don't just get security right away.  You gotta...  Too much too soon, Kenny?  Something bad's gotta happen. 
[00:49:30]  Something bad did happen today.  Yeah.  I got a little bit scared.  Wake up with Taylor.  This is Cosmo Radio.  She laughs like Janis Joplin at the end of Mercedes-Benz.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little scratchy laugh.  I like that scratchy voice of hers.  Is that her?  That's Taylor.  That's a different one than the ones you were showing us.  They're all hot.  No, it's the same chick.  Same chick.  Is that really her?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, if Taylor's the Demi Moore sounder one. 
[00:50:00]  Wow.  They're really giving you a beating.  Whoa, what's with that booty?  Ah, booty.  You want to protect that ass there?  I knew she had something going on.  What do you think, Kenny?  It's about you.  No, no.  Let them judge me.  That'll be the last thought that goes through their head once I rip their arms off and beat  them to death with them.  Kenny.  That's not nice.  Why would you even suggest doing something like that?  You can take criticism. 
[00:50:30]  I know, but I just love violence also.  I say, let he or she without sin cast the first stone.  I don't know what that means.  See, they're criticizing you and stuff.  And meanwhile, I'm sure they're not perfect people.  Well, this is more of an accurate example with him.  It would be, let he or she without extra chromosome cast the first stone.  It's a perfect.  What's going on around?  That's when she looks like she burnt her mustache off with some nair. 
[00:51:00]  Is that what happened?  Well, it says Taylor's nair disaster.  Jesus.  And she's got some redness on the sides of her mouth.  Yeah.  What, you have a handlebar?  Yeah, wow.  She's rocking the Steve C, it looks like.  Yes.  I get stretch marks on my mouth that are red like that from other things.  Cool eyes, I mean.  Let's get...  She looks nuts.  Let's get Kenny on Cosmo Radio.  What a cool kid on me and crazy chicks. 
[00:51:30]  Why don't you guys try to get on Cosmo Radio?  All right.  Hey, did anyone see American Idol, by the way?  I did.  Has he switched subjects?  Is it the same old shit?  Of course it is.  Well, I mean, it's the same format, but it stinks.  Where they make believe these guys...  There's no Paula, though.  Well, the bad auditions where they make believe they were caught off guard.  Are they doing that again this year?  Yeah, well, yeah.  It was fun the first year because you didn't know what it was about yet,  but then year after year, it's like, all right.  She's going to show us the bad auditions.  They had some bad ones and some good ones. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  But the bad ones were the...  What is she doing?  She's showing how she burnt her skin using Nair to get rid of her mustache.  She has a mustache?  You know what that means?  I guess if you're using Nair on your upper lip.  You know what that means, though?  A lot of hair.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  Keeps all that smelling.  Big.  I like it.  I like a girl with a little bit of a mustache.  She eats sardines or something. 
[00:52:30]  You can taste it when you kiss her.  It's nice.  My mother has one.  It's cute.  It actually makes a little sense, though.  Sure it does.  Any more?  Yeah.  There's probably some stuff happening.  Let's see.  I'm a little fixated on her right now.  Even the bad pictures are kind of funny.  You know.  They have a lot of photo galleries.  I've got to try and plow through.  What is she doing there with a mustache?  Exactly. 
[00:53:00]  She's got a little mustache there.  Can we see it?  Were they goofing on her?  Yeah.  Obviously.  Oh, yeah.  See, because now I can see some.  Let me see if you can get her arms out of the way of there.  Okay.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  Looking like Gallagher?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know what to do with this Cosmo radio.  Are they going on now?  Yeah.  Well, someone was supposed to tell us.  Are they going in right now?  Yeah.  They walked them in a few minutes ago. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, good.  Oh, that's great.  Because we don't have the audio up.  All right.  Let's talk.  Let's talk.  Not in private.  I don't want to be alone with you.  That idea is very terrifying to me.  I'm a little scared of you.  I'm not going to lie.  She might have the cash.  You saw the ring.  You're a very...  Yeah.  She might be ready for...  I'm starting to think that it doesn't take that much cash to hire you.  Think again, honey.  You still can't answer my question.  All right.  What are your credentials?  What are your credentials?  What qualifies you?  All right.  Where should I begin?  I'm a retired police officer. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  All right.  With over 25 years of experience.  That's good, Tay.  All right?  That's good.  That is good.  Detective Sergeant.  What was my rank when I retired?  That's pretty good.  I watched La La and Order.  I kind of know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Weren't they two different things?  I have no idea.  Okay.  I don't know.  It means I was a boss of the detectives.  Okay.  From my squad.  All right?  And then I worked with some very famous comedians throughout the years.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  My most impressive client back in the day was a man called Andrew Dice Clay. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, I know that man.  Never heard of him.  I was with him 13 years back in the day.  That must have taken a lot of protecting.  Well, no.  He's a nice guy.  He just knows how to curse good.  Have you ever shot a man?  On the job.  On the job.  Yeah.  Which job?  Police job or this job?  Detective Sergeant.  Andrew Dice Clay.  He shot Andrew Dice Clay.  The statute of limitations is up, but we don't have to get into it.  So what do you do for Opie?  Like, do you...  Whatever I'm told. 
[00:55:00]  But do you hang out with him all day long?  Are you with him at all times?  I'm a facilitator.  I'm a fixer.  Is it just him?  Or does the other one not need any protection?  The other one?  No, no.  I don't even know what they look like in a lineup.  Honestly, so...  Really?  Yeah.  Pull him up on your internet.  Kenny, do some.  Produce!  I'm just...  I'm in awe by you, Kenny.  Pull him up on your internet.  Do you go by Kenny or Kenneth?  Club Soda.  Yeah, why do you go by Club Soda, Kenny?  I don't get that.  I can't talk about it.  If anyone goes out at night, you're gesturing Club Soda?  No, I don't know why.  You're on the wagon?  It's a long story. 
[00:55:30]  We have plenty of time.  Yeah, it's a talk show.  You're the one, you know.  Talk.  What's Club Soda all about?  Yeah, but listen, I can't just tell you everything.  Club Soda to protect me and pay you bundles of money.  Are you really sure you want this guy?  I'm considering it, you know?  I mean, I'm a little girl, just like you said, and I live in a big, bad city.  And if Opie needs protecting, he's a man.  Don't you think a girl needs protecting as well?  Well...  Yeah.  Have you ever protected female clients?  Why does a man need protection? 
[00:56:00]  I mean, Andrew Dice Clay, I get it.  But, like, why those two?  Yeah, what happened with Opie, that he needs you to stand by him?  This interview is very one-sided.  He doesn't answer any questions.  You're not saying much.  No, no, I will.  But, you know, it's like the interrogation here.  It's the barrage.  We're good at it.  We're very, very...  You're in Cosmo Court now, so...  Really?  So why do they...  You nailed it.  You nailed it.  Should I slow down?  Why do they need protection?  We know why Taylor does. 
[00:56:30]  She was accosted just this morning.  Yeah, I got out of a friggin' cab.  Some crazy, non-homeless guy walked right over me, told me to take my earphones out of  my ears, which I didn't do, and I just walked right by him, and he could have jumped right  on top of me, right then and there, right in front of the McGraw Hill building, and there  would have been nobody there to protect me.  That's sad.  It is sad.  So if...  But that happened to me today.  That was the first time that ever happened.  You're so vulnerable, you make me sad.  Okay.  Why does he need protecting? 
[00:57:00]  He just needs, like, assistance.  Do you go home with him, too, or are you just here?  Do you sleep in his bed?  I do things, yeah.  Do you, like, do his dishes for him?  Are you a butler?  You're a butler.  Hey, just pay me.  I do whatever it takes.  Just pay me.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, like, your security guard...  He can do returns for you.  Slash...  He can really take stuff back to stores when you buy...  That's what I need assistance with.  Yeah.  I'll do it.  Just pay me. 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  So how much can I pay you to be my assistant slash bodyguard?  What's the going rate for a guy who doesn't answer questions?  I'm not getting any appearance space, so it's nothing.  No.  So it's nothing.  So he would work for free.  Essentially.  That fits right into my budget, actually.  You just take it out and trade.  Yeah.  See, she's agreeing.  I just don't think she understands where we're at right now. 
[00:58:00]  She's good to go.  She works for Cosmo.  This is fine.  No, you chicks are hot.  I can see...  People on his feedback are saying Kenny is bombing horribly, and it's a great lesson.  Yeah, we checked out your website.  You burnt your lip.  Yes, I did burn my lip.  Yeah, you guys really...  Yeah, you've done your thorough research, haven't you?  Remember when I got my mustache?  Yeah.  Never use Nair again.  We didn't even know who you guys were.  You were like bad neighbors. 
[00:58:30]  Likewise.  Yeah, but we get along with everybody.  The Martha Stewart chicks, the Al Q, the Shady.  The Shady.  Yeah.  But we see you every morning, and you never say hi to us.  Ever.  I thought you were like office workers.  You just like office workers.  Well, we thought you were too.  You don't say hi to office workers?  I know.  You could say hi to these girls from now on.  No, because there's like sexual harassment runs rampant in this company.  Well...  I keep my mouth shut.  We know.  Yeah, I should be seen and not heard.  Well, you are definitely seen. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  And you definitely look back.  I think your stares are more intimidating than you coming up and being like, hey, I recognize  you.  And isn't it the gentlemanly way to introduce yourself to a lady?  No, I mind my business.  Because I can't have platonic relationships with girls.  Why?  Because he's just such a sexual beast.  Nobody can resist him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a curse.  But I know your name now, Taylor.  Yes.  And I know yours too now, Kenny.  So when we see each other down...  He doesn't go by Kenny.  He has to go by Club Soda.  Oh, Victoria. 
[00:59:30]  Vicky.  Don't call me Vicky.  Why?  Because I will take you down.  I'm going to call you Vicky and pull your hair.  You are just breaking rules.  I know.  Left and right.  Someone's summoning you away.  That's hoping.  That's Opie.  Oh, see?  I told you I didn't know what he looked like.  Your master's calling you.  Yeah.  Yeah, but now I got your under-divided attention.  Yeah.  Thanks for coming on our show and finally introducing yourself to the girls, Kenny.  Well, I'm happy that we finally know you. 
[01:00:00]  Thanks for not answering any questions.  No, I'm happy that we've met you.  We no longer have to be scared of you because we know that you are, you know...  You work here.  You're allowed.  And there's your boss, man.  And there's Opie.  I'm trying to save two radio shows because we're listening in on this and this sucks.  Kenny, you're killing two shows today.  And why don't you tell him the truth that you're not a bodyguard.  You fetch stuff.  Oh, so he's...  So he is...  He's a professional fetcher.  He is your butler.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  I was about to Opie.  Do you let him on the air ever?  Yeah.  He usually does a better job on our show than he's doing for you guys.  Yeah, our listeners are calling going, Kenny, you're bombing horribly.  And where's Ant and Jim?  They should come in here because they're listening to this.  Let's just turn this into a party.  Yeah, get to know everybody.  We're all friends.  I mean, hey, the truth is we're not mean over here.  We're all problems with people.  We just don't know anybody.  I did call you Lurch and I am kind of sorry about that because I honestly thought I was  talking behind your back and you would never hear it.  There's a better shot at me crawling up here on my knees and talking to the two mics  I sing songs. 
[01:01:00]  What about that hit Fireflies?  You've got to play my song.  What?  I would love to hear your song.  We'll give you guys a copy.  Okay.  You guys have your own show now?  We have our own show now?  Yeah.  Someone said this is your first show, but that doesn't make sense because I've heard  you before.  Well, this is my...  Because you have that raspy voice I like.  Oh, yeah.  You like my voice?  Yeah, no, this show.  This show's like three years together.  No, we're going on our first show.  What are they talking about?  This is your first show.  Who's that?  Maybe this first hosting radio show.  This is my first time hosting a radio show and it's my fourth year doing it. 
[01:01:30]  What?  You were doing it with somebody else?  No.  I'm a young'un.  I'm a young spring chicken.  This is like my first radio gig ever.  I want to thank Anthony and Jimmy for not coming in here and hanging me out to dry as  well.  You're fine.  Ant and Jim don't want to come over.  Zero interest.  I just got a note.  Great.  Well, thanks for sending us Kenny.  Yeah.  I'm just happy to got to meet him.  I was a little intimidated by him.  How bad was the mustache, though?  Oh, go check it out. 
[01:02:00]  It's on the Facebook page.  No, we saw the pictures where it's all red.  It was bad.  It was real bad.  I have a mustache.  I mean, what do you want me to say about it?  I'm a real woman.  I have hairy nipples.  So, Jim.  Wow.  Man, I miss American Idol.  Yeah.  But is it still going out over our show?  No.  Because I heard hair.  She said she has hairy nipples.  Oh, yeah.  That was kind of the last thing she said.  No, I'm glad you turned that down.  I didn't want to hear that.  She's too tall.  Yeah, but I know she's tall.  She has hairy nipples.  Don't call me Vicki.  What's going on? 
[01:02:30]  What's her real name?  Victoria.  See that?  Get you in some high heels.  These girls are pretty proper.  I'm sitting down now, Lurk.  Kenny, I don't know if I was more scared of you before or after.  Or after.  Yeah.  Well, listen.  I'm with Vicki now.  That was perfect.  I have hairy nipples.  Vicki likes her hair.  You guys are pretty good looking, by the way.  Because most women in broadcasting are pigs.  Right.  And now you know.  No, for real.  Yeah.  You're all right.  Good looking radio show.  You're all right.  Yeah, thanks for saying that.  You're all right.  I appreciate that.  I didn't really know much about you, Opie. 
[01:03:00]  But I think I kind of like you.  I don't know who you are, but you're cute.  You are kind of cute.  I know I am.  It's okay.  Let's get past that.  He's cute.  I think I did tell you guys that.  No, you didn't.  Opie's gorgeous.  Are you married?  Oh, yeah.  Very happily.  You're cute for radio.  Yeah, I know.  I know that.  Kenny, tell him how cute I am.  He's gorgeous.  Tell him about my smile.  Now I can't even listen to this drivel.  Jesus Christ.  It really is.  What the fuck?  It's like liquid shite.  He'll show you the V shape of his stomach. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, no.  That's good stuff.  Wait.  I want to hear about your song.  It's actually better to shut it off.  We'll get you a coffee.  Just keep turning it on randomly.  It's so random.  Getting to step out of context.  Yeah, yeah.  It's happening, yeah.  How about you guys copy yourself and we'll take a listen to it.  And then I think it's going to have to see you.  It goes off because you're like, on six minutes later.  Thank you for having me on Cosmo.  Well, it's nice to finally meet you.  No, I'm thrilled.  You look it.  Like, now I know how, like, you girls are when I see you in the breakfast thing.  How do we appear?  Do we appear, what, nice, bitchy, and judgmental? 
[01:04:00]  How long is this going to go on?  No, you're like, you look very proper.  But you can't judge a book by its cover because those are usually, you know, you get them  alone and then all of a sudden, you know, you know what happens.  No, I don't.  Yes, you do.  No, not with you.  No, with your husband.  I'm not married, actually, yet.  I'm engaged.  Really?  All right.  I'm in the process.  Still listening?  It's a disaster.  Oh, we turned the volume down a few times?  Oh, good.  I have to say.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:04:30]  How do they look?  Wow, thanks.  You guys, we'll be back.  We'll take a listen to Firefly, such a masculine song, and don't go anywhere.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  I'm exhausted.  Wow.  This is why the terrorists hate us.  Yes.  I fucking tried.  There's nothing going on over there.  It's awful.  It's ponderous.  Go say hi.  I have no desire.  There was no reason to walk over there.  I felt.  They can come here.  Yeah, that's true.  Let them fucking come over here. 
[01:05:00]  Let them fucking slug trail over here.  Exactly.  And get a bigger audience studio.  Let them fucking Wattootsie over here.  Wattootsie.  Wattootsie, right?  I always say that wrong.  Wattootsie.  It was like, for years, they said he viscerated.  They said he viscerated.  He viscerated.  I think the one girl thinks it's cool to admit that she has hairy nipples.  Yeah, we can talk about it.  But that's where we turn the volume off.  You had to.  Is that the one that waxed her mustache?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  She's hairy in general, so she's got some hair going on.  Baboon nipples.  Baboon.  I bet she has a hair, like, really a big...  And Danny found pictures of hairy nipples.  Perfect, aren't you?  I bet when she takes a dump, she has to blow through her ass hair with one of those computer  keyboard cleaners, and then sit on the toilet.  What's the worst hairy nipple?  Like, one long one, or kind of like the whole area?  No, the whole area.  The whole area.  Just a little past, like, Peach Fuzzy. 
[01:06:00]  It's like when you watch a movie with your dad, it'd be, like, leaning over and just  giving his chest a lick when you're young.  Yeah, you're young and you put your head on his chest.  Yeah, I think we all do that.  He'd be, like, slathering his nipple up.  I think we all do that.  Boy, his tongue on a man's nipple.  That's a visual, Jimmy.  That's what that's like.  I love the fact that Jim thinks that's a normal thing for a kid to do.  Yeah.  I mean, we've all done it at one point.  Slather.  No, we haven't.  Talk for your...  Watch the show in our dad?  Well, yeah, but I didn't lick his fucking hairy nipples. 
[01:06:30]  No, I didn't lick it.  I'm saying that's what that would be like, though.  My dad had hairy, like, sweaty nipples.  Oh, God.  But, like, the nipple hair got kind of sweaty.  Why would...  There's no reason to get into this.  What about your dad?  I don't...  He's Italian, so he must have had more hair than all of us.  I think it was, you know, the old 70s Burt Reynolds thing going on.  You know.  One of those, but...  What, so what?  Is it hot?  They're like sevens. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  They're not bad.  The one girl, the hair is going to become a problem eventually.  She's not going to be able to keep it...  Keep it under control.  Keep it under control.  I'm going to get fucking lager.  It's going to get the best of her.  It's like Geordie Verrill with the fucking grass growing on her.  She waxes her eyebrows.  You can tell that.  Or maybe does that.  What is that thing where they're doing them all?  The electrolysis?  The threading shit.  I don't understand what that is.  But, yeah, they're all right.  Yeah.  They're all right.  Who's the other one?  Who's hotter?  The one with the fucking beard or the other one?  The one with the hairy nipples is probably like half a point hotter than the other one. 
[01:07:30]  Did someone call for the one with the beard?  Welcome back, everybody.  It's Wake Up with Taylor on Codman Radio Sirius 111, XM 162.  I'm Taylor.  That's Victoria.  Hello, darling.  Hello.  Hello.  And, of course, Kenny in the hizzy.  No, our Kenny.  Not that Kenny.  Kenny Club Soto.  I, uh...  Wow.  It was a pleasure to meet you.  We've been wondering about him for a while, haven't we, Victoria? 
[01:08:00]  Every morning we talk about him pretty much.  He has this ominous presence, you guys.  He's huge.  He looks like a non-green Frankenstein or non-gray or whatever the color Frankenstein is.  He's a big guy.  He's a big boy.  Right.  He's gray and black and white.  He's green in color.  And, uh...  That was an interesting colliding of radio forces.  Guy radio versus girl radio, I guess, right?  Yeah.  The shame of schticklows don't work over here, my friends. 
[01:08:30]  He has two songs.  It was nice to meet him.  I never knew what he looked like.  I never knew what he looked like either.  Confession.  Radio confession.  Never listened to the show.  Me neither.  Not once in my life.  I obviously know about the show, but I've never listened.  So, that was pretty interesting.  I do believe...  Opio and I went to the same college.  You did?  He went to Geneseo?  Yeah.  I'm a little bit younger than he is, but I did.  Yeah, he went to Geneseo.  Get out of town.  Yeah.  Hmm.  There's two songs from that, from Big Kenny in the CD player. 
[01:09:00]  Big Kenny, not you, Kenny.  Big Kenny.  Let's call him Club Soda.  I'm dying to know what Club Soda is, but...  It's probably something as bland as his personality.  He was very dry.  Well, there's Fireflies.  It's track one and track two is him doing Bad Romance.  Oh, really?  That's what they said, yeah.  Well, you do know that's my favorite song.  My favorite song in the world.  You know, it's so...  I have so much to say about men versus women relationships.  It's just so funny.  I mean, literally, he clearly just gets pummeled, right? 
[01:09:30]  Every single day by them.  I mean, basically, he's like, dude, you're like my boy fetch toy, right?  Yeah, well, he didn't have...  Yeah.  I mean, I would never talk to my assistant like that.  I would never talk to my assistant like that once I get an assistant, that is.  I never talk to my fiancé like that.  Yeah, your fiancé assistant.  My fiancé assistant.  So, anyway, I'm dying to hear this.  Do we have time for it, Kenny, or do we need to...  Yeah, no, we got wider, but let's play it. 
[01:10:00]  I would like to hear it.  Okay, so this is called Firefly.  Yes.  Yeah.  Should we listen to Bad Romance first?  Let's work so hard.  I don't know where Bad Romance is.  Track two?  I only have one.  I don't...  I can't...  Oh, okay.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  Bad Romance, our favorite song in the whole entire world.  Love Soda Kenny sings the hits.  Lady Gaga, Bad Romance.  I want you ugly, I want you dizzy. 
[01:10:30]  I want you everything as long as it's free.  I want you love, love, love, love, love, love, I want you love.  He sings the way he looks.  Yep.  It's happy that he thinks.  I want you drum of the touch of your hand.  I want your leather studded kiss in the sand.  I want your love.  He could come in here and feign the confidence he was feigning after.  I see zero skills. 
[01:11:00]  Everything.  Do you think they let him hear the actual Bad Romance song first?  Yeah, like, is it like karaoke style?  He's probably listening to it.  You think?  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he's listening to the beat.  They got all the same equipment.  I don't think he's listening to the beat.  No, I'm saying I think that's just how bad he is.  I'm just dying to hear him do the rah-rah part, but we should go do karaoke with him. 
[01:11:30]  He sounds like a detective sergeant.  That's what he sounds like.  That is worth it.  That one line.  The whole song.  The whole song.  The Kenny sings the hits.  That whole song was painful.  That whole song was painful, but that last part was worth every bit of the pain.  Okay.  Wow.  And Firefly, which what?  I don't know.  It's his.  Oh, no. 
[01:12:00]  I hope this isn't an original.  Probably is.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show presents Club Soda Kenny Sings the Hits.  Owl City.  This is a song?  Oh.  It's a hit.  Never heard this in my entire life.  No.  And again, we work on the radio, so.  It's a very masculine tune that he's about to approach. 
[01:12:30]  I was like, is it clean?  They're like, yeah, it's totally clean.  Center the store.  Oh, this is awesome.  Oh, this is great.  It does in your world, Kenny. 
[01:13:00]  This jerked me off.  Oh, God.  Is this like Sesame Street?  What is this?  He is kind of like a Sesame Street character.  He actually sounds like Bert.  Yeah, he does. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And Kermit.  Yeah.  Yeah, and a little Kermit.  Yeah.  Spooky.  That planet Earth turns slowly.  Yeah.  It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake while I'm asleep.  Everything wasn't meant to see.  I think he is asleep while he's awake.  When I fall asleep.  This has been.  Wow. 
[01:14:00]  That is.  I actually have to say that could be my new favorite song.  That's different.  Yes.  Well, I will say this.  I'm impressed by Firefly.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  That's him.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And we're up to a segment here that involves everybody's favorite. 
[01:14:30]  Actually, nobody likes this guy.  Bobo.  He's on the show.  Who knows what we were doing at this point.  Probably he was sitting in his underwear again for some ungodly reason.  But we noticed Bobo has a hemorrhoid.  So, of course, we have to exploit that.  Here it is.  Bobo.  I'm sorry in advance.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, we got to get Bobo in studio because there's something going on with Bobo.  And I know a lot of people don't like Bobo, but there is some breaking news with Bobo. 
[01:15:00]  So, we're going to get him in.  As he walks down the hall or runs down the hall like a fucking retard.  Oh, my God.  We're going to...  Look at him.  Look at his hits.  Why does he run like that?  And he's trying to hold the beverage and that's spill-ed.  It looks like he's doing some fucking corporate picnic.  Is he standing or is he sitting?  Running with his egg on a spoon.  There he is.  He usually stands.  Does some of his best work standing a pike.  Bobo, how are you, sir?  I'm doing okay.  I hear we have breaking news with Bobo. 
[01:15:30]  So, let's get right into this.  What's going on with you, Bobo?  Well, yesterday I had to go to the doctor because there was a situation.  There was blood in my shit on and off.  Stop getting fucked in the ass.  Wow, your brother's really doing some damage.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't think it's from that.  It turns out...  I love how he says, I don't think it's from that, which means he just proved that, yes,  he is having sex with him.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let the record state.  Yes.  No, no, that never happened.  Oh, oh.  That never happened. 
[01:16:00]  But what it is, this could be possibly a hemorrhoid.  I know sometime next, during the upcoming week, I'm going to be seeing a specialist.  Well, Bobby, you got problems with your dick and your ass.  Bobby knows what happened.  Well, this isn't that bad.  Will you listen for a second to me, you fuck?  Bobby knows something about hemorrhoids.  Bobby, would you like to check out his ass and then make sure...  If I see a hemorrhoid, first of all...  Oh, God.  Bobby knows hemorrhoids, though, for real.  Bobo, if you don't mind...  What are you...  Am I on Wikipedia? 
[01:16:30]  How do you...  What?  You're saying it like it says on your Wikipedia, Bobby knows hemorrhoids.  Bobby knows hemorrhoids.  Well, now it's going to say, yeah, it absolutely is.  What are you, stupid?  Look at that one.  Yeah.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Now listen to me.  Bobby.  And for the people that wonder...  Fucking Danny nailed him.  For the people that wonder, it's real every time.  He's got a weak stomach.  Danny nailed him.  He didn't say a word.  He just popped up with his disgusting hemorrhoid picture. 
[01:17:00]  And Bobby just...  Oh, God.  Wow.  Oh, Bobby.  It had some friends, I see.  That's terrible.  That hemorrhoid has friends.  That was really a bad one.  Bob.  Looks like a bushel of grapes.  Oh, God.  Now, Bobby, I know you're downplaying what you know in this world, but you do know something  about hemorrhoids.  Now, Bobo, please pull your pants down and show...  Backwards compliments.  And Bobby, I want you to...  And get E-Rock in here, too.  I don't know.  Now, that's Bobo before... 
[01:17:30]  No, what?  All right, listen.  Get E-Rock in here, too.  That looks like a fucking retard's vagina.  All right, Bobo, listen to me.  We're very concerned for your health, and Bobby does know a little something about hemorrhoids.  And we're going to get E-Rock in here as well.  Where's E-Rock?  Do you have any surgical masks?  I can't even look at that picture, dude.  Bobby, will you please help the kid out?  We're a little worried.  E-Rock, thank you.  E-Rock's in here.  Bobo, please pull your pants down and show the brown eye, and we'll see if you've got 
[01:18:00]  a hemorrhoid or not, okay?  You all right with this, Bobo?  All right, Bob.  I'm not sure...  Oh, what a fucking...  I'm not sure I would expect Bob Kelly to know anything about him.  I just thought Bob Kelly would be the last person I would...  I would...  Is that his ball back that's fucking hanging so low?  That is your two youngs have a ball back that hangs that low. 
[01:18:30]  This is the gayest gayest shit.  Hey, Bobby, you like the gay shit, so come on.  Let's get into this shit.  This isn't even gay.  This is, like, fucking...  Bobo, you have to...  Stay where you are.  Stay where you are.  This ass stinks worse.  But you have...  Oh, shit.  But you have to spread your ass cheeks apart to see the roid.  All right, hold on.  Now, Bobby, get in there.  Oh, my God.  There is, like...  I think there's fecal matter.  There's different color skin in his asshole.  I think there's fecal matter in there.  It's like an Asian asshole.  All right, Bobby, will you sit in your seat?  We've got to make sure this Bobo doesn't have a fucking...  Yeah, I'm going to go right here up, okay? 
[01:19:00]  That's okay.  I'm right here.  You don't have to get too close.  Wow!  All right, Bobo, now you've got to kind of, like, spread your ass cheeks, so...  All right.  Yep.  All right.  Somebody fuck that.  He's got to turn this way a little bit.  I'm not...  All right, turn toward Bobby.  Oh, look at this dude.  Spread the hair.  Oh, my God.  His asshole is so fucking...  Oh, it's just fucking... 
[01:19:30]  Hang on one second.  Just give me one second.  Holy shit.  Oh, this is horrible.  Why does it smell like a fucking deli sandwich?  Bobo.  Look at this monkey ball.  Look at this guy.  He's got a big monkey ball.  All right, Bobo.  You've got to spread the cheeks a little more because Bobby's got to take a look.  Now, Bobby's...  He's got to spread that pretty good.  Hang on.  Give me a second look. 
[01:20:00]  Take a look.  Take a look.  What the fuck is he doing?  Bobo, what are you doing?  Get a mic on, Bobo.  What is he doing?  Somebody has fucked that.  Bobo, what are you doing?  You said spread the cheeks a bit better so he can see better.  So what are you doing?  You're on the floor now.  He can't hold himself up and spread his cheeks at the same time.  All right.  Get him...  Spread him...  Spread him wide.  Spread him wide.  Now, Bobby...  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is that?  It's like fucking mustard.  Dude, what is that smell?  It's his asshole.  No, I know it's coming from his ass, but that's not a smell I've ever fucking... 
[01:20:30]  That's...  I haven't fucking...  I haven't washed my balls and I've been riding the subway for three weeks' ass.  Holy shit, this is...  What is this...  E-Rock, would you mind?  No, no, no.  Don't lyse...  E-Rock.  No, no, no.  Get a mic on E-Rock.  Now, E-Rock, how close...  Oh, my God, E-Rock.  Smell away.  Yeah, we want E-Rock to smell Bobo.  How close are you willing to get, E-Rock?  I can't even look at it.  Smell from here.  I'll get real close, but it's bad.  Why does he have that bald spot on his bald bag? 
[01:21:00]  You need Rogaine for your bald.  I don't like that his bald seam is fucking crooked.  His bald seam is crooked.  I've had so many operations.  I know about the operations.  You're ignoring his double asshole.  He's got two assholes?  It's right up here and...  He does have two assholes.  Wait, what?  It's like it ripped.  Oh, God, what's this wrong?  Bobby's popping up in there.  I need a fucking...  I need a mask. 
[01:21:30]  I can't smell it.  Oh, my God.  This smell...  What does it smell like?  I know it's coming from the ass.  You don't have to say it smells like ass, because that...  It is.  It's ass.  It's fucking ass.  It's, it's, it's...  No, it smells like...  What does it smell like, Danny?  Like, uh, no, it's, uh...  It smells like fucking death.  It smells like...  I know what it is.  It's the purple onions.  It smells like purple onions on a salad.  Can you tell me that I can?  I'm going to spray this napkin.  All right.  Iraq...  I'm dying.  Iraq is going to...  How close are you going to get, Iraq, to Bobo's ass?  I'll get as close as I can. 
[01:22:00]  Danny, can you come here and shit in my hands?  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go.  Oh, my God.  He's got shit clumps in his crack.  Like, it's going up his back.  Can you get a baby wipe and just wipe his ass?  Like, make him wipe his ass?  Not a lot of touch him anymore.  What do you mean?  New rules.  What do you mean?  Who broke that first rule?  What faggot broke that rule?  That's a fun idea.  I mean, he needs to do something.  I can be funny too, Bobby.  You know.  Yes.  All right.  Iraq.  Let's light it.  We'll leave it to Iraq.  It smells like mildew.  That's kind of what it is.  It's like a mildew-y. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  It's like moldy butthole.  Yeah.  Moldy butthole.  Yeah.  No.  Danny's.  Yeah.  Like a wet basement.  This is horrible.  All right.  Let's go to Iraq.  Iraq, the floor is yours.  Iraq's going to attempt to get as close as possible and get a whiff of what's going on with Hobo Pimples.  Listen, do you want me to hold the mic for you?  Yeah.  Bobby, go ahead.  Here.  I'll hold the mic for you.  Oh, my God.  Make sure you fucking mic him.  I'm going to fucking mic.  Because we like to hear the sniff live on the show.  His asshole has different colors.  All right.  Go ahead.  Iraq's going down.  What are you doing? 
[01:23:00]  Bobby, don't fuck this up and run away with the microphone.  I'm not going to.  Go ahead.  And make sure Iraq is mic'd.  All right, Iraq.  Right in there, Iraq.  Iraq is about three feet away.  Iraq, what are you pointing at?  Iraq's pointing at the double asshole.  Bobby, you're...  No.  Give Iraq the mic.  You can't do the job.  Not only does it smell and the double asshole and the shit going up on the crack to his back,  there's clubs of...  Clubs of toilet...  He doesn't clean his ass very well. 
[01:23:30]  No, it is.  Is toilet safer in there?  It's still in there.  All right.  Oh, God.  All right.  Go ahead, Iraq.  Bobo, what are you doing?  Spread those cheeks.  Yeah, spread them cheeks, Bobo.  And then Iraq...  Oh, God.  Danny just went in for a close-up.  Bobo, I don't think you're spreading them good enough.  Yeah, get them real...  Iraq's now...  Oh, it's puckering.  Iraq's now...  It's inviting.  Iraq's two feet away.  He's 18 inches away.  Give a good big sniff. 
[01:24:00]  Iraq, can we go 12 inches away?  12 inches.  Come on.  Now he's about two feet away.  Come on, Iraq.  You can do this.  Iraq, get in there.  Get in there.  You can do this.  Iraq's puking.  Someone get the pill, because Iraq's puking on the floor.  They're going to get mad at us again.  Wow, this is...  All right.  Come on, Iraq.  You're 18 inches away.  This is the worst I've done.  I thought he's still wearing a spirit. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, Bobby's still...  Oh, he...  I'm farting.  And that's just only because I thought that'd be funny.  I thought that'd be funny.  I thought that'd be funny.  I need a napkin.  I need a napkin.  I need a napkin.  Here, Bobby.  Oh, shit.  Get me a napkin.  This is so bad.  There is so much debris in his ass. 
[01:25:00]  Like, from his tailbone to his ball bag, it's like Haiti.  Look.  It's like fucking Haiti.  Look, as much as we're having fun here, we've got to make sure this Bobo kid's all right.  So, all right.  Iraq, get down there.  Bobo, spread those cheeks.  Oh, my God.  Iraq's going to attempt again.  Iraq got almost about 18 inches away so far.  He's attempting to get within what?  You get really close, and it hits you like a wall.  Iraq, can you get three inches away and smell it?  I'm trying.  Stop moving.  All right.  Spread those cheeks there, Bobo.  Spread those cheeks. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Iraq's studying it.  All right.  Here goes Iraq.  Yeah.  Spread the cheeks, Bobo.  Iraq's almost a foot away.  Go, go, go.  Come on, Iraq.  You can do this.  Come on, Iraq.  Take away.  Push back.  Come on, Iraq.  Spread them cheeks.  I can't get that close.  Spread them cheeks.  Spread those cheeks, Bobo.  Spread them harder.  All right.  There you go.  There you go. 
[01:26:00]  Iraq, get in there.  Come on.  Get right in there.  One time.  This is so fucking wrong.  There's no redeeming value to this.  You all right?  Did you smell it or what?  You can't get near it.  You couldn't get any closer than that?  Oh, my God.  He's got a force feel.  Your eyes burn.  It's like a skunk.  What?  You feel it like when it hits.  You know when it's too cold out and your nose starts to freeze? 
[01:26:30]  It hits your nose and your eyes at the same time.  Is that it?  I was hoping that he would get a little closer.  He can't.  It's bad.  Is there a roid in there, Bob?  No, there's no roids, but there's been a hammer.  Oh, is that horrible?  Something's been up there.  That's fucking 19 different colors.  What's Bobo doing?  He's still down with his cheek spread.  Oh, it smells so fucking bad. 
[01:27:00]  You all right, Iraq?  What does it smell like?  It's actually indescribable.  It just smells like it's rotting.  Like, it hasn't been cleaned in a long, long time.  It smells a lot like when some of the homeless people come in.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's got that homeless, you know, I wipe my ass, but not so good.  But not so good.  You know, combined with body odor and sweat and stuff.  Good news, Bobby. 
[01:27:30]  Puddle of AIDS writes from Jersey,  Mr. Kelly's Wikipedia has been appropriately updated.  Great.  Look at Bobby.  He's got shit stuffed up his nose.  Great.  What'd you put up your nose?  Fucking gub.  You put two pieces of gum.  He broke, like, two pieces of dentine and shoved him up his nose.  It fucking works.  No shit.  That's great.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Bobo's still, I just look over.  Bobo's still there holding his ass open.  Iraq, you want to give him one more shot? 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Can't you just go for the three inches?  I don't like that Bobo has, like, comfortable balls.  No, I'm not brave with you.  They're just relaxed and mushy.  Yeah, they're not all tight and nervous.  I think Bobo's sleeping.  No, I'm awake.  I'm a bit shocked about doing this, though.  What do you do for a living, character?  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Iraq's going to attempt one more time.  Open it up.  Open it up.  If it isn't enough embarrassing that I've got to go to a doctor because of blood in my shit. 
[01:28:30]  That's how I feel bad.  This is probably worse than that.  Well, yeah.  Than having to possibly know that I might end up having to have surgery for hemorrhoid removal.  There's no hemorrhoid, though.  Bob Kelly's the expert.  He's saying there's no hemorrhoid.  You don't have hemorrhoids, dude.  You're fine.  Yeah.  You've got to spread them.  Spread them.  Yeah, Iraq's going to try one more time. 
[01:29:00]  Really good.  Oh, God, Anthony.  Jesus.  Dude, he didn't even move.  He just went, oh.  All right, Iraq, one more try.  Now there's water in it.  Let me tell you something.  Don't dip your hands in water while you're wearing headphones.  I think I'm electrocuting myself.  All right.  That was the last thing you ever did.  It's glistening.  It's running down like a vagina.  I don't know what the heck.  It looks like soul glue.  What the heck is on my ass, cold water?  I threw a wet tissue. 
[01:29:30]  To help.  It helps.  But it hit your tailbone.  But now the cold water is running down all the way down his ass to his ball sack.  Cold water helps with the roids.  It cools them down.  Yeah, doesn't that feel good?  All right, go ahead, Iraq.  It's like a doctor.  Here we go.  It just looks like a...  Here it does, but usually I would know what's up my ass.  Why does he talk like that?  Iraq's going in one last time.  Three inches.  Just go.  Oh, God.  Just go.  It's glistening now from the water.  Here it goes.  Iraq's going in. 
[01:30:00]  Get right in there.  Get right in there for the show.  For the show.  You're in.  You're in.  Come on.  Go.  Big sniff.  Push down and go.  Push down and go.  Big sniff.  Come on.  Big sniff.  Big sniff.  Let's hear the sniff.  Go.  Oh, it's...  Go.  Let's hear the sniff.  He pukes on his ass.  I should have left. 
[01:30:30]  Horrible.  I should have left.  You should have left.  Why did you stay?  What the fuck am I thinking?  He's got gum in his nose.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It looks like the ugliest cunt I've ever seen.  That's what this asshole looks like.  It does look like a very ugly vagina.  Like a 70s.  That fucking big fat twat.  Look at that.  It's like the whole real estate of his asshole is his entire ass crack. 
[01:31:00]  Did you think that you'd ever be having this conversation when you were in your early 20s?  No.  I didn't want to.  Just be like, I don't know what I want to do later.  What are the guys' assholes?  Where's Sam?  Right here.  Someone has a question for you, Sam.  This is Dave from Long Island.  Yes, Dave.  I was just wondering, was this in the Frank Reynolds pack?  Sam, people want to know if this was in the Frank Reynolds packet.  No, this is not.  The talent coach.  This is not mentioned at all.  Oh, it's not. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  Should be.  Holy shit.  Why is Bobo still fucking on the floor with his ass?  Bobo.  Spread.  Bobo, you can, yeah.  You can get up.  Leave the wet piece of toilet paper there.  I haven't seen it enough.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  The rest of Opie and Anthony, my name is E-Rock. 
[01:32:00]  E-Rock Radio on Twitter and Opie and Anthony are off, so we play some of their best stuff.  It's just what we do.  Otherwise, we'd have nothing to fill for five hours.  Some would say we have nothing to do during the live show as well, and you would be right.  In this segment here, Dr. Laura got some heat about using the N-word back in 2010, and  I thought, you know, since we just had the Paula Deen situation where she got in trouble  for something she said like 20 years ago, I thought we'd bring this back up to show how  we progressed as a society involving the N-word we haven't at all. 
[01:32:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to get, we're going to change gears drastically, but Dr. Laura.  I have to hear this.  Wow, wow, wow.  She loves the N-word.  Sarah, um, oh, no.  This is all over the fucking life.  Steve.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that, uh, if you're going to say nigger, you should, uh, keep it in context, uh, yeah,  the dieticulitis was caused by, uh, Dr. Steve. 
[01:33:00]  He rules.  Let's just wake him up.  I hate him.  Monday, let's wake him up at 6.02.  Really make him miserable for the day.  With an inane question.  Yeah, with something really just stupid.  Yeah.  Uh, Dr. Laura takes a phone call from Jade, who's in an interracial relationship and has  a problem.  Boo!  This got Laura, uh, Dr. Laura Schlesinger to say the N-word a lot. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  It started with this.  Jade, welcome to the program.  Hi, Dr. Laura.  Hi.  I'm having an issue with my husband where I'm starting to grow very resentful of him.  I'm black and he's white.  Uh, we've been around some of his friends and family members who start making racist comments  as if I'm not there or if I'm not black.  And my husband ignores those comments and it hurts my feelings. 
[01:34:00]  And he just acts like he didn't.  Well, can you give me an example of a racist comment?  Because sometimes people are hypersensitive.  So, tell me what's, give me two good examples of racist comments.  Okay, last night, good example.  We had a neighbor come over and this neighbor, every time he comes over, it's always a black  comment.  It's, oh, well, how do you black people like doing this?  And do black people really like doing that?  And for a long time, I would ignore it.  But last night, I got to the point where...  I don't think that's racist.  But the stereotype... 
[01:34:30]  I don't think that's racist.  No, I think that...  No, no, no.  Oh.  I think that's...  Well, listen, without giving much thought, a lot of blacks voted for Obama simply because  he was half black.  Didn't matter what he was going to do in office.  It was a black thing.  You got to know that.  That's really boring.  Let me tell you something about Laura.  I, first of all, I hate her.  Yeah.  I hate her guts.  And I love the fact that Stern had those fucking pictures of her fucking pussy put up 
[01:35:00]  years ago.  The greatest kicking of somebody off a pedestal ever.  She's a fucking...  That, as much as I would...  I don't want to see her fire, but that woman called up and said, my husband...  What the woman is saying is, look, this is my husband's friend.  I'm his wife.  Every time the guy comes over, he addresses my race.  Right.  That woman has a point.  That would be annoying.  Yeah, it would get annoying.  Of course it would.  Like, she's...  It's like, I'm the guy's wife.  I fucking...  I'm here every day.  Oh.  And he's coming over and addressing her race. 
[01:35:30]  It'd be like...  Yeah, look at her.  Like, Laura has a nice long pussy, too.  Look at that big fucking hairy muff.  Well, she had youth on her side when that picture was taken.  But Laura...  You can tell Laura's got a weird thing.  Like, and of course, media matters went after her.  You know, I just hate them.  Right.  But I think that...  I think Laura's a fucking...  She doesn't know how to fucking deal with this.  Yeah, like, why did she just dismiss it so quickly?  That's not racist.  That's not...  It might not be racist, but it's annoying to the woman and should be addressed more so 
[01:36:00]  than just blowing it off like she did.  Yeah, that's not unreasonable for the woman to want to be in her house with her husband.  And every time this guy comes over, he asks about black people.  Maybe it's not racist, but it's racial.  It's annoying.  Yeah, it sounds like it happens more than one person is doing this to her.  Yeah, I'd have slammed her back then.  Huh?  Yeah, of course I would have.  With her big fucking dumb tan lines and her...  Of course.  ...big muff.  Yeah, I'm so happy that happened to her, though.  Her pussy don't look like that nowadays.  Ah, no. 
[01:36:30]  She should be happy those pictures are out there.  She's enragingly goody-two-shoes.  She's a fucking know-it-all.  She's a bore to listen to.  Anyway, that started it, and now we ramp up here.  Not everything that somebody says...  We had friends over the other day.  Got about 35 people here.  The guys who were going to start playing basketball.  I was going to go out and play basketball.  My bodyguard and my dear friend is a black man.  And I said, white men can't jump.  I want you on my team.  That was racist? 
[01:37:00]  That was funny.  How about the N-word?  The N-word's been thrown around.  Black guys use it all the time.  And turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is nigger, nigger, nigger.  I don't get it.  If anybody without enough melanin says it, it's a horrible thing.  But when black people say it, it's affectionate.  It's very confusing.  Don't hang up.  I want to talk to you some more.  Don't go away.  That's into a Journey song.  Been so long.  She makes a good point there.  Her point there is okay, but it was like this woman wasn't saying that. 
[01:37:30]  No, no, no.  It wasn't like this woman said, you know what, someone said the word nigger, and then Dr.  Laura said, what about black comedians?  Well, that's different.  She didn't say that.  It was like...  No.  Right.  She just threw that out there for no reason.  Yeah.  It's like she wanted to have an excuse to say it.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  I'll give it to her.  Just drive on the West Side Highway.  After her Journey song, the discussion continues.  Uh-oh.  What song was that?  Faithfully? 
[01:38:00]  No, no.  No, uh...  Say goodbye.  Send her my love.  All right.  I think it's called Send Her My Love.  And then after that, she came back to talk to this woman some more.  Yeah.  I think you have too much sensitivity and not enough sense of humor.  It depends how it's said.  Is it okay to say that word?  Is it ever okay to say that word?  It depends how it's said.  Black guys talking to each other seem to think it's okay.  But you're not black. 
[01:38:30]  They're not black.  Oh, I see.  So a word is restricted to race.  Got it.  Can't do much about that.  I can't believe someone like you is on the radio spewing out the nigger word, and I hope  everybody heard it.  I didn't spew out the nigger word.  You said nigger, nigger, nigger.  Right.  I said that's what you hear.  Everybody heard it.  Yes, they did.  I hope everybody heard it.  They did, and I'll say it again.  Nigger, nigger, nigger is what you hear on HB.  Why don't you let me finish a sentence? 
[01:39:00]  Okay.  Don't take things out of context.  Don't double N-double-A-C-P.  Leave them in context.  And I know it came from a white person, and I know the white person made it bad.  Thank you very much.  She's really, Dr. Laura is really annoying to listen to.  But, but, I got a but.  I do have a but, but she's making great points.  She is, but she's making them from a weird place.  She's not, it's like that wasn't what this woman called up and said.  But, it's almost like, if this woman had called up and said, look.  Someone, a white man said the word nigger, and I don't like it. 
[01:39:30]  And then she would have said, well, does it offend you if Chris Rock says it?  No.  Then, to me, that's this discussion.  But this woman just said it's annoying when these guys come over, and his, his, his fucking,  uh, family's always making racial remarks, and it gets to be irritating.  Right.  And then she made it into this, which has nothing to do with it.  Yeah, this totally changed.  This has nothing to do with the, what the caller was talking about.  Absolutely.  You know, you know something, though, we've been in situations where the conversation gets  a little dynamic and changes subjects in the middle of it, so I'm not even going to falter  on that.  The thing is, once the subject changed, she was absolutely right. 
[01:40:00]  The context she used it in was fine, because she's just describing what you hear.  She wasn't blurting it out, uh, in any offensive way.  She was describing what you hear.  And this woman got completely offended.  Uh, she could say it.  She had no problem saying it.  She's talking about black people being able to say it, but Dr. Laura couldn't say it.  Dr. Laura.  And Dr. Laura's like, fuck you.  No, no, here's what bugs you about that.  And if that woman had said that, I would agree with Laura. 
[01:40:30]  But she didn't.  Dr. Laura was the one who raised that point, saying, you see black guys, and the woman's  like, well, you're not black.  Like, she, she was reacting to Laura saying that.  And, and the woman even said, is it right for anybody to say it?  Is it right to ever say it?  Like, she was basically saying that nobody should say it.  Laura brought in, well, the black, Laura was being fucking phony there, man.  I'm telling you.  You think?  Yes.  It was an excuse to say nigger.  It was an excuse to get that off her chest.  It was not organic.  That should not have gone that way.  Because that's not what the woman was talking about.  I just saw that. 
[01:41:00]  I don't think the woman said that the neighbor said, uh, the N-word.  No, or that it was, uh, and the woman wasn't getting on a soapbox about blacks can say  it and whites can't.  It was only when Laura raised that and the woman goes, well, you're not black.  And then she goes, oh, okay.  So it's, it was just something very forced about it.  Dr. Laura, one more clip here.  People are going to say, okay, what do blacks think?  What do whites think?  What do Jews think?  What do Catholics think?  Of course there isn't a one think per se, but in general, there's think. 
[01:41:30]  And what I just heard from Jade is a lot of what I hear from black think.  And it's really distressing and disturbing.  And to put it in its context, she said the N-word, and I said on HBO, listening to black  comics, you hear nigger, nigger, nigger.  I didn't call anybody a nigger.  Nice try, Jade.  Actually, sucky try.  She just wants to get away with saying it. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  She wants to get away with saying it.  She's not fucking trying to be funny.  She's, it's, it's not helping the discussion at all.  She's coming from a really weird place.  It's a weird fuck.  She's a repressed white bitch who probably, who probably would love to say that and be  the white girl who could say it around her big black bodyguard.  Look at how fucking phony she was.  Go on, take on the day.  And there's pictures of her cunt all over the internet, which she denied, which she denied.  To me, that's a fucking phony, man.  Great.  Oh, dude.  Like a bush.  I just think that she's extraordinarily phony.  Yeah?  I think so.  Yes.  I think, I think, I agree with Jimmy. 
[01:42:30]  So what does the media do with this?  I'm taking the other side of this.  They shouldn't do anything with it.  Well, they're all over it.  Of course they are.  She shouldn't be penalized for it.  No, there's no, she, she, she, she's allowed to say what she said.  Absolute freedom of speech issue right there.  I agree with you.  That isn't used to incite.  It's not used, whatever her motive is, she pulled it off, um, brilliantly.  If she wanted to say it, she said it without setting herself up for a big fall.  I disagree.  I think that she fucked up because it was to me, and dude, I'm, I'm never against people 
[01:43:00]  saying what they want to say.  But to me, just hearing that, when I read the transcript, I was like, that's something  weird, because that's not what that lady was saying.  It isn't, but that, that, the point is, we've been on radio long enough to know that  the point changes depending on anything.  You could, the subject changes fucking 90 degrees in a second, uh, on, on, on radio.  So, even though she didn't really address the woman's point, which was that, you know,  she goes, people come over and, and it's always black this, black that, you know, uh, whatever. 
[01:43:30]  She did bring up the point that she felt things were racist when friends came over, and that  kind of goes hand in hand with, uh, using racial epithets.  Let me, let me ask you, when she said, this is what bugged me about the clip.  The woman raised, I thought was a legitimate point.  That would get annoying for any, if you're white and your wife is black and her family, because  I hear that when you're white and you're married to a black, a black woman, they're  fucking, the blacks are terrible with that stuff.  Why would your family come over anymore?  Well, her family.  Oh. 
[01:44:00]  Just to boo your little white dick.  Boo!  But, she was saying that, and immediately, Dr. Laura doesn't say to her, well, have you  tried talking to this guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Or have you addressed, she goes, well, what do you mean by racist?  Like, she's immediately challenging the idea.  Right, right.  It's like, why?  I'll give you that, yeah, she did.  That's where, to me, it's coming from somewhere weird.  It's not like, the woman said, this guy came over and asked me a question about black  people and he's a racist.  She said it happens every time he comes over, it's black people this and black people that 
[01:44:30]  and he asked me, every time.  So she's saying it's consistent, which makes it at least racially annoying, if not racist.  That's where it comes from a bad place.  I think Dr. Laura could have got a little more info from the caller, too.  Yeah, yeah.  She jumped way into the discussion without, you know, getting a little deeper into what this  woman was getting at.  She wanted an excuse to go where she went, because she goes, what do you mean by that?  Give me an example, give me two examples of racial comments, to make sure you're not  too sensitive.  No matter what that woman said, unless it was, you're an ugly nigger, unless it was something  that obvious, Dr. Laura would have taken the direction she took. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  That fucking, keep showing your pussy on the internet, Dr. Laura.  That's what you should be doing.  She wanted an excuse to say nigger to a black person.  She doesn't do that kind of show.  Fuck her.  Hold on, Buzzard noticed something in this.  It was Buzzard, Louisiana.  Yeah, the, uh...  Ah, yeah, I think your phone sucks, brother.  Phone.  He wanted to say that Dr., uh...  Caller on Dr. Laura mentioned the n-word first.  Oh, did she?  I don't know.  She did, but it was the direction where the call was going. 
[01:45:30]  I know she did actually mention the n-word.  Oh, this guy's going to explain why it's okay for black people to use the n-word.  All right.  Calvin, Long Island.  Oh, sorry.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  First, I just want to let you know, I just got Sirius XM like two weeks ago.  I love your show.  I listen to it all the time.  Thank you.  Damn!  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Tell the boss.  My explanation, I'm a black man.  Let me explain to you why it's okay for black people to use n-word.  First, it's like, imagine you and your friends.  You call each other names, like, hey, asshole, dick, whatever, you know, you're a bitch. 
[01:46:00]  That's cool.  That's your friend.  Now, imagine somebody else on the outside calls you that.  It's not cool when they call you that.  You don't know that.  Right.  So, by the way, it's like a little fraternal thing, like you and your friends calling each  other n-word, being black people, hey, my nigga, what's up, what's up.  It's cool.  It's like a brotherly thing.  A white guy says it means something totally different because of the history of the word.  But does it mean something totally different now?  Yeah, a white guy has to mean something different if a white guy says it.  History, because look at the word gay, used to mean happy, and now it means homosexual. 
[01:46:30]  So, didn't the word change over the years?  Do you honestly think a white person using the word, and not in a hateful way, but describing  maybe something they saw, or just without it being inciting?  Oh, I saw some niggas around the corner.  That's cool.  Yeah, the white guy might be saying it without hate behind it.  This guy said...  It's just really, being a black man, it comes off just totally different. 
[01:47:00]  Like, yeah, Patrice O'Neill on the show, ask him how he feels about it.  Like, I haven't listened to him.  Ah, he wouldn't give a shit.  I don't know, but this guy says, explained it well.  Like, the way we joke with each other, it feels different coming from someone else.  So, to me, there was a street justice with that.  If you said nigger to the wrong guy, the street justice was, he's going to punch you in the  fucking face for it.  Absolutely.  I have some white friends that, you know, I guess, with just, you know, hip-hop and  everything, some white guy thing, it's cool, they, my nigga, and like, you know, I know 
[01:47:30]  them, so I know they don't mean it like that, but still, I feel like they're being like,  it's like posers, just trying to sit in sometimes and say that.  It's corny.  It's still a little offensive, but the main thing is, like I said, you and your friends,  you hang out, you call each other names, bitch, pussy, whatever, I'll kick your ass.  Somebody you don't know totally comes up and says, hey, bitch, now you want to fight,  right?  That's not cool.  See, I don't know you, so why would you say that to me?  Calvin, it's a pretty famous story on this show, but I got knocked out for saying the  N-word on a basketball court, and... 
[01:48:00]  Oh, God.  No, but I was hanging out with these guys very closely all the time, and I felt like I  could say it because they were saying it, and there was no hate behind it when I said  it on the basketball court, and I got punched in the face, and I was down on the ground.  Well, maybe officially not knocked out, but I was fucking dazed pretty good.  Well, now, some friends of mine that do say, like, if it bothers me, I'll be like, hey,  like, yo, chill with that, relax, like, you know, you don't have to say that, and they'll  respect that, but, you know, somebody I don't know totally says that. 
[01:48:30]  No, this guy knew, he was a friend of mine at the time, and I felt like, because I was  kind of, you know, in that culture, that basketball culture, and hanging out with these guys,  I felt like I was one of them.  I really did at the time.  I was, I was four, what was I, 15, 16, something like that, and I said it, and I said it, and  there was no hate behind it whatsoever, and I got, you know, and I got, I got punched.  Yeah, well, I also got to say, see, I don't know the voice just yet, so who is it?  Is that Opie or is that Opie?  That's Opie. 
[01:49:00]  Opie, yeah, Opie, yeah.  I think you, sometimes you guys sound like you really come off a little racist.  Like, I listen.  A little?  Yeah, a lot.  That's what I'm saying.  That would be Anthony.  Yeah, that would be Anthony.  I talked about blaming stuff on a Negro and all, and I'm like, oh my goodness.  Well, once you learn, once you learn, uh, uh, the show a little more, because you're,  you're new to the show, and we appreciate you as a listener, sir, you'll realize that  I am a complete and utter racist, uh, horrible human being, and, uh, it just has to be accepted. 
[01:49:30]  And also, um, uh, that show, Louie, I love it.  I forgot the other guy who's on it.  I started watching that show.  I love that show.  Oh, Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jim, you guys cracked me up.  I'm telling you, I, I'm a teacher, so I'm off for the summer, but I just wake up, I wake  up at six in the morning, just to turn on the series, and listen, you guys, I'm kind  of like, ask me to tell you about that.  That's cool, man.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you.  All right, Calvin.  Thank you, brother.  Thanks, brah.  All right.  I hope my explanation helped you a little bit about how, like, it's like an inside thing.  That was a good way of...  Yeah, you made a good point.  It was a good way of explaining it, because it wasn't like... 
[01:50:00]  But I don't think white guy, all white guys are saying the word with hate behind it.  That's all.  That was the point I was trying to make.  But, you know, the consequences in my life was I got punched in the face, like Jimmy was  saying.  You know, that's the consequences.  I also think there's some phoniness going on when the word is used in, not hateful,  but a confrontational way.  When somebody does you wrong, all you want to do is hurt them as much as you can verbally  first, and hopefully it doesn't escalate. 
[01:50:30]  But if a black guy fucks you over somehow, you're going to fucking at least think the  word, if not blurt it out as a white person.  I don't care how liberal you are or anything.  If a black guy comes up and is fucking with you in some way, shape, or form, you're going  to use the word, and not in a pleasant way.  And me being a black man, I know, like, you know, I know not every white guy's race, but  I have a lot of white friends.  I'm telling you, if they...  I'm sure if they were in a situation with a black guy and they got pissed off enough,  I know that N-word's going to come flying out sooner or later. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the atom bomb, you know?  Is it frustrating that you guys don't have a word for white people to really piss them off?  Not really, but I don't think...  Yes, they do, neighbor.  The worst N-word.  That's the thing, the N-word, I know, like, I think that's in their arsenal, and, you  know, because black guys don't say, and I call somebody, like, you know, powder right  here or something.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to tell you about that.  Hold on, that N-word thing, that's the big mistake they made, because now everyone is 
[01:51:30]  saying N-word all over the fucking place, and you know what N-word...  You know what it means.  You know what it means.  It conjures up the word in your head.  It allowed so many more people to say the word without saying it, if that makes sense.  I don't remember I'm on satellite, and I can actually curse, but I'm still keeping it  a little clean.  Yeah, you can.  But when you see the news and all going the N-word, you'll see it all day with Laura Schlesinger.  Oh, she's used the N-word, N-word.  These people can't wait to say the N-word on TV now.  I know.  And see, another thing, like, if I'm in a confrontation and a white guy does say, even 
[01:52:00]  though I'm pissed and enraged, I still try to act like it doesn't hurt me, because then  he feels like he's empty.  He doesn't have nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love it.  I love chicken.  I love watermelon.  So what?  What else you got?  You know, I don't like watermelon, but I love chicken.  You know, I'm...  Just tell him that, though.  I think...  You know what?  The fried chicken thing is weird, because I think every human being...  Fried chicken is wonderful.  ...laws fucking fried chicken.  God, that shit's delicious.  I can't defend the watermelon thing, but the fried chicken, there's a lot of white people  that love their fried chicken, man. 
[01:52:30]  I don't like watermelon.  I really don't.  I really don't.  I fucking hate watermelon.  I love it.  It's absolutely disgusting, but the fried chicken, everybody loves fried chicken.  Of course they do.  Yeah, come on.  I mean, besides the black men, those Chinese people know how to fry some chicken.  I'm sorry.  Black people love that.  If I didn't give a shit about myself, I would eat fried chicken every fucking day.  I know.  Simple as that.  Popeyes, motherfucker!  Yeah.  Give me a bucket.  I just wanted to say one more time, you guys are great.  I love it how I got through to the show in like 10 minutes and then I have to wait an  hour on the phone.  Oh, God. 
[01:53:00]  A new listener.  He's an ethnic gentleman that we don't really have in our demo.  Go get your bucket in, sir.  Thank you.  James in D.C.  James.  Yeah, I used to live out in Long Beach, California back when Rodney King,  why it's just stuff going on.  I had some black friends.  Uh-oh.  No, you didn't.  Not with that accent.  Yeah.  Go ahead, sir.  I'm sorry.  I used to sit around and smoke weed with them.  And I don't understand what Opie's saying about getting lost in the culture, 
[01:53:30]  but you get real comfortable with them when your friends are hanging around.  They start throwing around, nigger this, nigger that.  And then before long, you forget who you are because you're in that.  And I just got comfortable with saying it.  And in the house, when we were sitting around, you could say it,  but we went out like around the corner of the 7-Eleven playing Mortal Kombat or something.  And, you know, you get excited when somebody's as good. 
[01:54:00]  You go, way to go, nigger.  You know.  Right.  And I forgot who was around me.  And there were other black guys that weren't in that group that we were in.  And they kind of looked at me like, what'd you say?  And I'm just like, uh-oh.  And then I realized I was white.  You just realized you were white.  Jesus.  Oh, shit, I'm white.  That's funny.  Were you all on the dance floor when this happened?  Right.  That's funny.  Look, I heard so much, I didn't think the word was so powerful. 
[01:54:30]  You know what I mean?  How they were just throwing it around at the time.  And I didn't know shit back then.  And you're 14, 15 is different, too, though.  I didn't know shit.  It's like you're much easier to fall into a group and do as they do.  It's a different mentality when you're that young.  Yeah.  But adults, it's a weird thing, man.  It's like one of my favorites.  Eddie Murphy said something so brilliant one time.  It was him and Dick Cavett.  And Dick Cavett was asking him about that word.  And Dick Cavett just looked at him and went, nigger.  Like, what is that word?  And Eddie just lapsed into this making fun of Dick Cavett. 
[01:55:00]  He goes, you see that?  I said it right, too.  We didn't even do nothing.  Like, it was some goof on what Cavett had really done there.  Uh-huh.  And he called him out.  It went beyond the interview.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  It was funny, but it was like, people can read your motives.  I say it on stage.  I've been talking about Mel Gibson.  And I've been saying it, quoting him, because you're going to get raped by a pack of niggers.  And I'm talking about how annoying it is that people focused on the racial epithet when he's obviously not a racist.  He was just trying to hurt somebody.  And I think people in the audience can feel...  Do you get some oohs?  Not really, because it gets silent. 
[01:55:30]  And then I explain myself, why I'm saying it.  It's not to be shocking.  It's just, why do we care that this guy said this is private life?  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a point to it.  But if you just say it to be gratuitous, and just because you want to get away with it, you're a dick.  Yeah, that and it, when you're trying to incite somebody into, you know, something.  Yeah, those are the two ways where it should piss people off.  But if you're using it in context, like you do on stage, there's no fucking problem with it.  I would argue, if anyone was offended at it, I would argue the point and not be embarrassed that I had said it. 
[01:56:00]  Or not feel like, oh no, no.  So, that to me is where it's legit, because my motive isn't to go, let me say it in front of a couple of...  Not saying it, by the way, isn't going to make it go away.  It hasn't for many years.  To make it so taboo and this, people still use it, believe me.  I've seen, I've been in groups of white people and there hasn't been a, nary a black person around.  And I've heard that word a lot. 
[01:56:30]  I've been alone in a room.  Echoing off those walls.  Watching television.  But Media Matters will go after her, like they're going after Imus.  They're fucking pigs.  Yeah, it's going to be all over the place.  As much as I don't like Dr. Laura, she was fine with that whole fucking thing.  Her motive was a little weird and all, but...  Yeah, I think that she's just a little repressed white girl who probably likes black on blonde porn.  But that's, that's, it was fine, whatever. 
[01:57:00]  Fuck.  I wasn't going to say.  That was more Dr. Laura.  Makes a good point here, though.  It wasn't time you used to fucking not worry about your words.  As long as, as long as you kept it within FCC...  FCC was all that you cared about.  It's funny, these people that yell and scream about the FCC now, that's a joke.  That's not, you don't have to worry about the FCC anymore.  Don't worry about a fuck slipping through.  You don't have to worry about your own fucking bosses.  Can I ask a question about Dr. Laura, though?  Somebody who's so interested in... 
[01:57:30]  Oh, it's long and hairy.  But for somebody so interested in fighting it out,  why'd you take yourself off the air early that day when you could have just fought it out?  Somebody who, the old days of fighting it out, what happened?  You had more time on your show.  But what she was saying is, and maybe she's incapable of doing this,  I know you absolutely can get on the air and Jimmy could, you know,  make a viable argument for his side of the story.  Maybe she felt, and that's why she's taking herself off the air permanently, if she does, 
[01:58:00]  and why she took herself off the air that day.  She didn't have the ability, and realized she doesn't have the ability anymore,  to go on the air and voice an opinion without stirring up shit that's going to get you fucked.  So she took herself off the air?  You know, I think that's...  Whether it's right or wrong or phony, that is what she's saying.  That's why she did that.  I think she saw she fucked up.  Meanwhile, she should never have had to have said,  Wow, I fucked up.  What bothers me is that she just said back in those days, 
[01:58:30]  people would duke it out with you.  Because she's saying, she's mentioning fight it out.  So if she's bringing up fight it out,  well then where the fuck were you?  But she's saying you can't do that anymore.  But who stopped her?  She took herself off the air, unless she's a liar.  Because you'll only get yourself in more trouble these days,  if you try to duke it out and defend yourself.  But following Jimmy's point, she could have at least done that  and said, look, I can't even fight this anymore.  She could have used that 15 minutes to say something.  What, the hour for the rest of the show?  To even say, look, she could have used that 15 minutes to say, 
[01:59:00]  you know, I remember a time if we had a phone call like this,  we would have duked it out.  I'm sitting here knowing I can't do that anymore.  And explain her case on her own show.  Maybe she didn't have the ability to do something like that.  But she's explaining to Larry King now, which is confusing.  I know.  She could have done it on her own show.  Yeah.  I think she could have, too.  Her message is very conflicting.  It's back and forth, because she's saying things like duke it out,  and it's like, but you took yourself off that day.  Unless she's lying and management yanked her, 
[01:59:30]  you could have done another hour of racial discussion and completely...  You're both right, by the way.  Maybe realizing what she said,  she thought maybe she could just get in more fucking trouble.  Maybe.  If she opens her gap anymore.  But then she should have just said that.  You know what I mean?  Her listenership, eight and a half million people,  she has a massive fucking audience.  And she's not a shock jock, quote-unquote.  No.  She has a lot more leeway in language than we ever had in the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, of course.  Here it is.  You know, when I started in radio, 
[02:00:00]  if you said something somebody didn't agree with or they didn't like,  they argued with you.  Now they try to silence you.  They try to wipe out your ability to earn a living and to have your job.  They go after affiliates.  They send threats to sponsors.  That's their right, too.  Yes, but I don't have the right to say what I need to say.  My First Amendment rights have been usurped by angry, hateful groups who don't want to debate.  They want to eliminate.  Yeah, but management could tell those fucking people, you know, we're not taking you seriously. 
[02:00:30]  She's making very good points.  The whole part where Larry King says, well, they have a right to do that,  they do technically, but it's one step of separation away from completely censoring you.  I hate when people go, well, you could say what you say,  but this group has an opportunity to say what they say.  No, they are getting you fired.  They are saying, you can't say this or we will get you fired.  Oh, how will you get me fired? 
[02:01:00]  Well, we'll use our First Amendment right to do this.  It's like, it's very, a weird gray area there when somebody can argue their point against your point  and have a reasonable debate, or they can have a debate and get you fired.  Because they're not having a debate where both ideas are being heard and hashed out.  They're trying to exactly remove your ability to say what you want to say.  Say what you want to say.  Exactly, yeah.  That's very sad.  Through threats and mob tactics of sending a virtual leg breaker to your sponsors and affiliates 
[02:01:30]  and saying, get this person off or you're going to be sorry.  That's not a First Amendment right.  That is threatening somebody's livelihood based on what they're saying,  and they don't have a right to do that.  They have a right to, but they shouldn't be listened to.  They should not be listened to.  No, I don't think they even have a right to do that.  I don't think they have a right to use mafia tactics to send people over to your associates 
[02:02:00]  and threaten them, guilt by association, to have you removed for what you said  and threaten you with your livelihood.  That is not freedom of fucking speech.  Bravo.  It's not.  It's a threat.  It's somebody threatening your livelihood with what they're saying.  Here's what their argument is. 
[02:02:30]  And this is what I've heard Sharpton say this.  And this is where he diffuses that point because it's been raised to him.  He says, well, as I'm paraphrasing, but he's saying, well, don't we have the right  to go to advertisers and tell them where we're going to spend our dollars?  If you're supporting somebody who is denigrating us, this is his thing, if you're supporting  by financing the show that is denigrating us, don't we, the consumers, have the right to  go, we will spend our dollars elsewhere other than on a product that goes into paying someone 
[02:03:00]  who is denigrating us?  That's how they justify their pushback.  They don't look at it like they're removing your freedom of speech.  So to argue with them, you have to ask, why don't you want to have this debate?  Why do you want me silenced instead of saying they don't have the right to?  Because that's how they say, yeah, we have the right to this.  That's how they paint it for themselves.  So they don't look like they're fucking removing your freedom of speech.  That's fucking semantics.  That is a crafty, phony fucking way of getting around the fact that you're using your organization 
[02:03:30]  to strong-arm sponsors and affiliates to get rid of somebody based on what they're saying.  It's disgusting.  It is.  Because Reverend Al didn't accept Imus' apology, if you remember.  He needed Imus fired.  Imus should have killed him, though.  You know how disgusting that is?  Oh, yeah, Imus.  He should have killed him on his show.  He's so much smarter than Sharps.  Yeah, Imus kind of blew it.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Yeah, he kind of blew it.  But they didn't even accept Imus' apology.  That's just disgusting, too. 
[02:04:00]  They weren't going to stop until Imus was taken off the fucking air.  Simple as that.  And, you know, one of these days, I just hope management is brave enough to fucking not  to give these people power and ride it out.  Or the advertisers.  She made a great point, but I think she's still phony.  I think in her mind she is moving on to something else, and this is a perfect way to  fucking leave radio to do whatever she's got planned.  She's hinting at the internet. 
[02:04:30]  She probably wants to take it all on herself.  She has a fucking platform, though.  See, the difference is, like, when this show gets in trouble, Larry King doesn't call, or  whoever on, she can go on and do Hannity, and, like, I mean, you guys could, too, but  I'm saying, she has a tremendous platform to push back.  And if she only has a few months left on her contract, she has no financial interest.  Well, we're not going to pay you.  She's got a fucking few months left on her contract.  So it's not like this show that had two and a half years left, and, like, what the fuck 
[02:05:00]  happens now?  She's got Larry King.  She has massive options, and she has an audience that will push back for her.  But she might be dramatic with this whole thing going, look, I can't do it here anymore,  so why don't you people follow me to my new venture?  You'll be right.  Look, I'm going to fucking hit the internet.  I'm doing a fucking webcast.  Whatever.  Right, right, right.  She could get on, I don't know if she could get on Oprah, but she could get on massive shows.  But she doesn't want to save her radio career, because I think she really has something else  in mind.  Or she would.  Or, of course, she would.  If you have eight million listeners, and you're making the type of money Dr. Laura is, you're 
[02:05:30]  going to fight right to the end.  There's a reason to fight.  But if you have something else in your mind, like, you know, I'm moving on, then, of course,  you jump off right there.  Dramatically, too, by the way.  Maybe management gave her that opportunity.  There's a few things that could be happening behind the scenes.  We should know more than anybody.  Whatever you see and hear isn't the whole fucking story.  It's usually not even a piece of it.  There's behind the scenes shit going on, maybe with management.  Or maybe, yeah, she wants to have this big ending before she leaves to get some listeners 
[02:06:00]  to a webcast or whatever the fuck she's doing.  Who knows?  Yeah.  By the way, it sounds great to go to the internet, but fast forward a few years, and they're going  to get the internet, too, man.  Somehow, someway.  They will.  They just will.  Look at the stuff we can't do on satellite radio.  This was supposed to be, you know, well beyond broadcast radio, and, you know, a lot of 
[02:06:30]  the stuff we did at NEW on regular radio, we simply can't do on satellite.  And they're going to do the same fucking thing to the internet.  I don't know how yet, but they're going to do it.  You know how they do it?  They get you through your fucking, through your web provider.  Provider, yeah.  They go to the provider and go, oh, you're putting this kind of shit on your fucking,  and then you can't go to the smut fucking sites and use their servers. 
[02:07:00]  So it's really, there already are things going on where people go, I don't like seeing that.  I don't like hearing that.  You see all these popular websites.  I don't need to name any.  Oh, of course.  The media ones.  They're policing themselves, though, already.  Already this shit they just will not allow on their sites anymore.  The issue with the internet, too, is so weird, because it goes into that garbage community  standards argument, and, like, there are certain trailers.  I know when Buttman, I'm telling you, Stalliano, having those charges thrown out, was fucking,  why is he not on Larry King? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, that's huge.  That was a massive fucking win, because they were using the same type of stuff, like,  I think it was a Joey Silvera movie about, like, squirting milk or some weird shit that  they found offensive.  And it was, I believe, an internet trailer, and that was where it got scary, because your  internet's in everybody's house.  Yeah, yeah.  So it goes through all communities.  So you could violate the community standards in Broward County, Florida.  Yeah.  But I think that, thank God that was thrown out.  This is where the conservatives, I want them out. 
[02:08:00]  I'm happy that they're not in office right now.  Yeah, when it comes to shit like this, they're assholes.  We, uh, the listeners fucking, I have a feeling that the listeners are killing me, telling  me, like, that I'm attacking Dr. Laura.  Uh, I don't know.  No, they're just saying she has a nice hairy hair.  I didn't even look at her father at all.  Big slit.  Okay.  Uh, Dr. Laura is smart.  She's playing the victim card like black people do.  Oh, well, give her that.  Okay.  Our management will always look down on talent.  Huh.  True.  That is the God's honest.  Oh, God, I wish I could, whatever.  Uh.  I think they're behind us 110%, guys. 
[02:08:30]  Really?  Do you?  Do you?  110%.  110%.  Oh, they're good.  I'm just trying to duke it out and look what happened to him.  But he didn't try to duke it out.  Did he at first?  What was the initial response?  I don't remember anymore.  Did he get back on and just, like, I'm sorry I did that?  Did he say I'm sorry immediately?  I'm sorry I did that.  He apologized.  He wasn't sorry.  But he didn't fight back in the sense that when he was on Sharpton's show, I thought he 
[02:09:00]  should have, uh, killed him.  Imus going on Sharpton's show should have been good enough for Reverend Al Sharpton.  Right.  That's why he's a piece of shit.  He knew even with Imus coming on that day, he still was going to go all the way and get  him fired.  Absolutely.  He didn't even have an open mind when fucking, uh, Imus walked through that door to do some  radio on his, on Reverend Al's show.  That's why he's a piece of shit.  He doesn't have an open fucking mind.  Yeah.  He was grandstanding and going, wow, this is going to be even better for me. 
[02:09:30]  He saw the opportunity.  He didn't even listen to Imus that day.  And then he had a stupid daughter in the studio with her arms pretty much folded with  that look on her face.  Yeah, the one who, remember all that shit?  Is she a nappy-headed hoe, he was saying?  Right.  I don't want to put up with any of that crap.  Is that the one that got in trouble with the cops, Danielle, whatever the fuck her  name is?  I don't know.  Is that the one?  There was one of the, one of his daughters and his ex-wife, I think, got pulled over.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know if that was the same.  Who gave shit to the cops.  Yeah, but.  Lovely.  But that's why Reverend Al's a piece of shit. 
[02:10:00]  He never had an open mind in that situation.  He was loving the attention and, and he was, it didn't matter.  He was going to get Imus fired no matter what.  But that was Les.  That should have been good enough when Imus went on his fucking show.  Les Moonves didn't have to fire him.  That showed a lot.  Yeah, I know.  They didn't have to.  Yeah, I, you know, I blame them too.  They should have hung in there.  But there was, uh, uh, one of the, one of the, one of the upper management guys was,  you know, was a black guy.  N-W-A-C-P guy?  Yeah, he was very into this whole Imus thing. 
[02:10:30]  And again, getting him off the air.  None of the white people around him will ever have a racial discussion that's honest and  go, look, he, we all know, you know, whatever it was, they would need to say.  They probably, whenever a black guy says racism, especially in a corporate situation, all  the other white people are like, okay, I guess you're right.  Okay.  Hey, okay, sure.  Yeah.  Because they don't have friends like Patrice or Keith or any of these dumb guys that we  hang out with who we yell back and forth and everybody's honest.  Right.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like.  No, I know.  It's true.  I'm never afraid of fucking having an argument with one of my black friends. 
[02:11:00]  No, no.  I know where I'm, I'm not coming from a horrible place.  Oh, this is kind of, uh, Adam in Connecticut.  We got to, we do have to break, but Adam writes, uh, in America, we hate terrorism, but we  love economic terrorism.  I hope after he wrote that, he struck a pole.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony, Sirius XM. 
[02:11:30]  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  And this segment that we have for you right now, we're going to play, involves cyberbullying  of celebrities.  Yes, celebrities do not go unscathed from the, uh, sharp and bitter tongue that the internet  provides people who have no lives whatsoever.  So we play some video clips of celebrities speaking out against cyberbullying, and, uh,  also we talk to the staff about their own personal experiences of being bullied. 
[02:12:00]  Hope you can relate.  If not, go post it on Reddit somewhere that you're offended.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, listen, so you got the celebrities coming out of the woodwork to do some of this,  uh, bullying stuff on the web.  What are you doing in the woodwork in the first place?  I don't know.  And where's Sarah Silverman's?  Uh, she did one too.  Did she?  Yeah, and, uh, everyone wants to get some publicity.  We got a lot of them to play.  You want to play, uh, I want to hear every one of them.  All right, this is, uh, one of the stars from Glee felt like they had to, uh, speak out 
[02:12:30]  against celebrity bullying.  Sam's favorite show.  Celebrity bullying.  Uh, cyberbullying.  Chris Colfer?  Celebrity bullying.  Chris Colfer?  Something like that?  Is that a guy?  I don't know.  I don't watch that fucking show.  Uh, good answer.  Hi, I'm Chris Colfer.  I still don't know.  I still can't tell.  I can't tell.  I don't know what Chris Colfer is, but I want to fuck it.  Wow.  Chris Colfer's balls didn't drop?  Wow.  Or it's a chick.  How old is Chris Colfer before I say that? 
[02:13:00]  80.  All right.  It's got to be a kid.  Hi, I'm Chris Colfer.  In the last couple weeks, a number of LGBT youth have tragically taken their own lives  due to some ugly circumstances of their environment.  Wait.  If you or anyone you know are also having a rough time, it is vital that you know that...  Wouldn't it be more hip to talk about it before everyone else talks about it?  Yeah.  Like, a kid like this, I'm assuming this is a kid that knows a little bit about this.  Yeah.  Well, why didn't you speak up before?  Oh my God, it's a guy.  That's a guy?  Yes, of course.  Chris Colfer, it's a guy. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  That's probably...  He's probably perched on a bridge.  All of a sudden, teenage bullying.  It's not news.  No.  It's been happening forever.  It's easy to talk out about it now.  You should have talked out about it a year ago.  Two years ago.  Three years ago.  He's dressed like Anthony Hopkins puppet magic.  Five years ago.  Six years ago.  He's dressed like Fats.  Puppet's name was Fats.  Focus, focus.  You're dead.  You're dead.  Fucking love that movie, too.  That was a good one.  Mustard was in the Until It Sleeps video. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, sorry.  I got my videos mixed up.  You got your condiments mixed up.  A little info coming in.  Relish was in that one.  Oh, I didn't say that.  That was a good one.  I relish a good joke.  You know, it's nice.  It's vital that you know that there are people out there who care and can help.  I know what it's like to be bullied and teased every single day.  Why?  And I know that it may seem like there is no chance of happiness left, but I promise you  there is a world full of acceptance and love just waiting for you to find it.  Is he gay?  So please. 
[02:14:30]  Is he gay?  How are you as smart as you are with such terrible observations?  Well, he says he was bullied, but he's on a fucking TV show.  How bullied could he be?  Yeah, really, man.  Yes, Travis?  Yes, Travis?  Isn't he on Glee?  Yes.  Yeah, he was on Glee.  How bullied can you be?  That means that cyberbullying is bullshit.  I mean, some kids...  We're cyberbullied then.  Some kids are jumping off bridges and some kids are starring in hit fucking TV shows.  Have you seen some of my tweets that I get?  My mentions?  Well, I can't keep up with this guy today. 
[02:15:00]  I'm cyberbullied.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's crazy.  You all right?  I'm great.  I got such...  You're so fucking hyper.  I got such a good night's sleep.  All I would ask is just breathe.  Take in a deep breath.  There you go.  Anyway, it's on...  But it does prove it's bullshit.  Yes.  Some kids are jumping off bridges and other kids are fine and they're fucking big, huge Hollywood stars.  Why are you showing Biff?  Because, people, I'm just trying to say bullying has been happening since 1955 at least. 
[02:15:30]  Why don't we blame Biff for...  Biff should really be taken to task.  His bullying at the Enchantment Undersea Dance was just remarkable.  Not only that, but, I mean, the diner.  Like, why can't George just go and have some chocolate milk at the diner for?  He didn't want to see him there anymore.  They got computers back then when Biff was doing the cyberbullying?  Because I don't understand that back to the future timeline.  In two, it was the future, so there was some cyberbullying going on, I believe. 
[02:16:00]  Can I get that picture?  I got it.  There was some hoverboard bullying, I think.  Actually, I think Flea was cyberbullying McFly on the big video phone trying to get him to go in.  So who's the original cyberbully?  Flea.  So let's get a picture of Flea up there.  McFly!  Let's get fucking Flea up there.  He started this shit.  Shit, what was his character?  Noodles.  Noodles.  Fucking noodles, man.  Noodles.  Roll.  Fucking Flea was noodles. 
[02:16:30]  Let's get the rest of this gay kid statement out.  Let's hear this poor little child.  So please, before you take a drastic action that could be your last, call the Trevor Project.  Know that you have friends, you are loved, and that you are not alone.  And know that despite such a current challenging time, there's so much to look forward to.  And I look forward to sharing it with you.  Big juicy.  I promise it gets so much better.  Oh, I bet.  Thank you.  Shouldn't he have sung his statement? 
[02:17:00]  I promise it gets so much better with a little lubrication.  Well, you know.  That picture rule.  Yeah, I am so childish.  What am I going to do?  It's like a daddy.  I ain't got nothing else.  I got to tweet the original cyberbully.  Well, first of all.  I want to see a picture of my kid.  Oh, look at his little hairdo.  He's got the little spike hair.  I didn't realize that picture was on my phone.  Sorry.  Michael J. Fox.  Sorry to talk about my kid.  God forbid.  All right, let's see.  You don't mind if you're talking about your kid? 
[02:17:30]  I'm fucking around.  BTTF2 looks like Michael Douglas with cancer.  Look at him.  Doesn't he?  Yes.  He kind of does.  Except he shakes more.  He's knocking all the chemo stuff on the floor.  It's all willy-nilly.  He keeps trying to put in the radiation.  His hands are all over.  Hubbital hubbital.  Is that double necktie going to take off, Danny?  What do you think?  Well, I mean, we've got to give it another few years.  I don't think it happened.  Another few or another two?  How many years?  Another five years.  Another five years?  Give it some time.  Yeah, I dig the double collar necktie thing. 
[02:18:00]  The double Japanese flag rising sun tie.  That is pretty good.  Whatever the hell that is.  Yeah.  I'm digging it.  Stinks.  That whole franchise.  No, it's great.  Stinks.  Don't you love how Needles looks over to the side, like, off camera?  It's like, I got him.  I got him to talk.  And then he cuts off.  Jim, you're not going to get it on Blu-ray?  Come on.  Got to get it on Blu-ray.  Stinks.  Come with us and see the original in the theater.  We're going.  I got extra tickets.  We're going.  It's going to be playing in theater. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, Westbury.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's what I'll do.  What night of the week is that?  It's probably a Saturday.  Oh, cool, cool, cool.  Because I know it works Saturdays.  Yeah, blow off some gigs.  Let me know what night.  I'd be happy to go.  It's only, it's at noon.  You can make it fucking noon.  We're going to go.  We'll drink some beers.  Cool.  Just get loaded and fucking drink.  Three hours before that, you'll be drinking beers.  Of course.  Noon?  Fuck.  Got to wait till noon, Ann.  You all right?  I can't wait.  All right, Grandma.  I miss Grandma. 
[02:19:00]  Do you miss your grandma?  Not really.  Yeah, I don't miss my grandma.  I mean, I miss, you know, what she was, but I don't miss what she was.  Good fuck.  Sorry.  It just slipped out.  That's great.  It always did.  Big, big twatted bitch.  All right, make some sauce. 
[02:19:30]  Shut up.  She smells like powder.  Powder and sweaty nylon stockings.  And orthopedic shoes.  This isn't artistic.  It went on too long.  But I liked it in the song.  It went on too long when she went,  La. 
[02:20:00]  James should have leaned over and just clocked her in the face.  That big fucking Hetfield fist.  Needles rules.  Needles.  Good old needles.  All right.  The next almost celebrity that had to speak about cyberbullying was Wendy Williams.  The big titted monster had this to say about it.  Hi, I'm Wendy Williams.  I want you to join me in the fight against bullying.  Over the past year, far too many young people have taken their lives due to bullying. 
[02:20:30]  What?  18-year-old Rutgers University student Tyler Clemente.  What?  15-year-old Phoebe Prince in Massachusetts.  13-year-old Seth Walsh from California.  13-year-old Asher Brown from Texas.  And 15-year-old Billy Lucas from Indiana.  You know, Jay Moore said it best.  Jay Moore's?  Jay Moore said it best.  Oh!  He said...  Stop the bullying!  Maybe he should say it himself on the show, but he said...  I think it might have been in his book. 
[02:21:00]  I read his book, and his last book was terrific.  He said if he thought his son was gay, the first thing he would do was get him fucking karate lessons.  Yeah.  Right?  Think about it.  Yeah.  How many middle school kids could fucking do some karate moves?  There are intolerant people that will never, ever accept gay people or people of other races or whatever.  And you should learn to defend yourself.  That's not a bad place to start.  If you think your kid might be bullied because of his sexuality in school, why wouldn't you get him in a dojo? 
[02:21:30]  Are they called dojos?  A dojo.  Ah!  Get him on some cement stairs.  Right?  Wouldn't that be the first move?  Yes.  And then I think his second move...  I think he said the second move would be to introduce him to Judy Garland Records or something.  Fucking Jay Moore's.  He couldn't just leave it alone.  Anyone see him in the preview for the Clint Eastwood movie?  Yeah.  Jay's looking fucking creepy on the park bench talking to... 
[02:22:00]  I know.  Matt Damon.  Was he talking to Matt Damon on the bench?  Matt Damon.  Yeah, he looks...  I don't know what part he's playing, but it's...  It's like he got a fucking good part in a good movie, motherfucker.  Jay can act, man.  Good for Jay Moore.  Jay is a really good fucking actor.  That goddamn Suicide Kings, you could watch that fucking...  I probably watched it ten times.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right, let's get back to...  Ten times.  Let's get back to Wendy Williams.  Suicide Kings.  Suicide Kings, stop cyberbullying.  It's bad for gay kids, like Bobo. 
[02:22:30]  Does he like Bobo?  He hates him.  No, he goes, you're gay.  Bobo's gay.  I think he's cyberbullying fucking Bobo.  I'm cyberbullying.  Lucas from Indiana.  Yeah.  He's got to stop.  Does he?  No one deserves to be bullied for any reason.  Why?  If you're the victim of bullying, or you witness someone being bullied, say something, or tell 
[02:23:00]  an adult.  And if you're a parent, you've got to listen to your child.  Talk to them.  Make sure they understand they are protected, supported, and loved, and that they're not  alone.  For more information on bullying and how to prevent it, log on to stopbullyingnow.hrsa.com.  H-R-S-A.  That's not as bad as it's bullying in general.  Cyberbullying to me is the new thing that they're talking about, but bullying is one. 
[02:23:30]  She's talking about bullying.  But let me tell you a little something about bullying.  Okay.  Don't bully me.  It just makes you the person that you are.  It happens.  Kids bully each other.  It's like watching puppies bite each other's faces.  That's what they do.  Human nature.  There's no stopping human nature.  Right.  Thank you.  It is human nature.  People will bully.  Kids are fucking horrid to each other.  Terrible.  It makes you build character.  No, it depressed me.  I don't know. 
[02:24:00]  I guess it would be junior high.  Dick size?  No, I always did good.  Nice.  I did good.  Late bloomer, though.  Yeah, you sure were.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You remember when them little blonde hairs sprouted up?  You go, Uncle Paul, what's happening to my body?  Putting a net down, trying to get Opie to jump out of the apple tree.  Remember I had to show you your body's changing, Gregory?  Hair was sprouting. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I tweezed it out, though.  Yeah, you don't like hair.  I didn't like it.  And I gave you, I put the little special spit lotion on you.  Helps the hairs stay away.  Damn puberty, right?  Uncle Paul.  I don't like it.  God, I hate when that happens.  Not a big fan of puberty, are you?  Yeah.  I wish you could just give him a shot.  Sure.  Stay that age.  Yeah.  Let's move on to Lance Bass.  Oh.  Yes.  A gay gentleman, by the way.  Well, I guess. 
[02:25:00]  He came out of the closet.  Is he one of the guys that came out of the closet after his fame was over?  Closet, yeah.  That's good.  That's good for everybody involved.  Yeah.  Wait till no one gives a shit about you, then tell the world.  That you're gee.  Right.  That's probably, oh, I was going to say something.  Probably.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  I'm gay.  Well, the cover of People Magazine says NSYNC's Lance Bass and People Magazine exclusive giant  yellow letters, I'm gay, underneath it.  I think he's gay.  Then every other magazine, no shit. 
[02:25:30]  The gayest photo ever.  Well, I was really shocked to hear that so many suicides have been happening so recently.  You know, the school year has just begun.  So, I mean, that obviously has something to do with it.  And it just, it makes me so sad to know that these kids, it's just an unnecessary thing  to do.  I mean, I can tell you right now, when I was in high school in Mississippi, I was one of  the first ones to jump on the bandwagon to make fun of a gay person.  Oh.  And, I mean, look how I turned out. 
[02:26:00]  You know, it's like, I had a secret this whole time.  So, if people can look at me and see that, like, I was one of those bullies that, like,  always made fun of gay people.  And I had this huge secret.  So, there's always a bigger story than what you see.  You know, as a teenager, I really didn't get picked on because I really tried to stay,  you know, in the background.  You know, I tried staying friends with every single person, but a lot of kids don't have  that, are not that lucky to be able to socialize like other kids.  Some people just don't have that skill or even they want to. 
[02:26:30]  And those are the ones that really get picked on just because they're not best friends with  the most popular person or they don't have the best clothes or, you know, they might be  a little more poor than someone else.  And these kids just don't realize, you know, that that just doesn't matter right now.  It doesn't matter at all.  What did he say? 
[02:27:00]  What?  What?  I think it was something about gay people.  What is that?  I just want to see something up on the screen there.  Lance Bass.  Why don't we move on to Tim Gunn.  Project Runway.  No, go back.  What did you do?  You're terrible.  Yeah, that one.  There it is.  Isn't that funny?  What are you doing? 
[02:27:30]  That's homo Lance Bass and my girly.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  That's from People Magazine when he came out.  That's great.  Yeah.  Obviously, he's looking away at a gentleman off camera.  Exactly.  She's pulling on him like, no, this can't be right.  No, she's grabbing him going, please, just get me out of Long Island.  He's crazy.  He has guns.  He's a lunatic.  What is he doing?  Yes.  He hates anything.  They can't be traced back to the motherland.  By that, I mean fatherland. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, actually, her great, not even great grandfather, I think it was her grandfather, or great grandfather,  might have been one of them, was a Nazi soldier that was found dead, drowned in a river.  So was the grandfather.  You think he's great.  He was murdered.  Yeah.  It was just grandfather.  I said great.  I meant fantastic.  But he was a Nazi, yeah, an authentic Nazi soldier, her grandfather.  It's funny.  I did a Raw Dog show pre-taped yesterday for Tomorrow, me and Bobby, this comedian named Dustin Chafin, 
[02:28:30]  who I've known for years, and just happened to be in the building, so we did it with him.  And he was saying how I think his grandfather was a grand wizard in the Klan.  Really?  He's from Texas, yeah, and he never knew him.  The guy died.  But it's like, I knew the guy a long time.  I didn't know that, but he was a hardcore Klan, his family.  He said his family brought the Klan from Kentucky to Texas, I believe.  Awesome accomplishment.  Or some, like way, way back, from somewhere to somewhere, but they actually brought the Klan.  Resume stuffer?  Yeah.  He's not a racist, though.  And by the way, oh, he's not, huh? 
[02:29:00]  No, he isn't.  Sorry to hear that.  Tomorrow at 4, you can hear all that excitement on Raw Dog.  Nice.  All right, cyberbullying.  All the big celebrities are talking about it.  Here's Tim Gunn from Project Runway.  Hi, I'm Tim Gunn, and I have a very important message for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,  You're available?  And that is, it gets better.  It really does.  And you may be thinking, what does Tim Gunn understand about my anguish, about my despair, 
[02:29:30]  about how I'm feeling, about my particular time and place in the world right now?  Well, I'll share with you.  As a 17-year-old youth who was in quite a bit of despair, I attempted to kill myself.  And I have to tell you, when I woke up the next morning after taking more than 100 pills, 
[02:30:00]  I was in quite a bit of a tick-tack.  I shouldn't be here.  This isn't what was meant to be.  I frankly just wanted to start life all over again.  There are people who can help you.  You have a sucker guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  To all of you, it really requires a collaboration between you and the people who love you.  Shut up, Tim.  The people who you can depend upon, no matter who they are as mentors. 
[02:30:30]  In my case, it took a very serious intervention.  The boy fights for PT.  And it was the result of the botched suicide attempt, to be blunt.  I am a huge advocate for the Trevor Project.  If you want to kiss me, I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  The Trevor Project is a suicide prevention hotline for JLBT and questioning youth.  JLBT.  Shut the fuck up.  How about any teenager that wants to kill himself?  Asshole.  She's got your goddamn pie hole.  Asshole.  Your identity will be protected.  Asshole.  You don't have to worry about getting parents involved if you're so inclined. 
[02:31:00]  I understand the desperation.  I understand the despair.  I understand how isolated you can feel.  And you have a lot of...  That gay's got it knocked.  You're very emotional.  So easy to get laid.  ...about you, and I'm included in that group.  So reach out.  Get help.  You're not alone.  It will get better.  I promise.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  Oh, jeez.  Here's what annoys you about celebrities and stuff like this. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  And look, I don't understand what he's doing as noble.  He's coming out and talking about his life.  But it's like...  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just very pro-comedian.  But I've been talking about this shit for years.  Yes.  Who gives a shit?  Right.  I cut my wrists a bunch of...  It's like...  It's a hot topic now.  But the fact that it's like, oh, the actor makes the big revelation.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck yourselves.  And by the way, this is...  If he's closed off assholes.  In a month, they'll move on to something else and won't even give a shit about this topic.  I just don't respect them because they fucking...  Right.  These guys never reveal anything. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  This is one instance of confused youth killing themselves.  It's tragic.  But you know something?  There are kids that kill themselves because their grades aren't good.  Because their parents molested them.  Because they fucking feel inferior.  Because they got rejected by a girl.  They got rejected by a girl.  Right.  Same thing.  This is just another instance of, you know, you're gay.  It's tough to deal with.  Um, some people can.  And they do. 
[02:32:30]  And then other people kill themselves.  Like they do with any other stressful thing in life.  How about what they do?  The real issue here is not cyberbullying.  It is fucking privacy.  An invasion of privacy.  And I'm saying that because it's funny how nobody is talking about that.  Because Americans love invading privacy.  Oh, my God.  We love looking...  Those guys were doing nothing different.  It was creepy and very disgusting that they showed this guy's private life.  But what's the difference between that and the morbid curiosity everybody has from Mel Gibson's private life falling apart. 
[02:33:00]  Or Tiger Woods' private life falling apart.  Listening to the tapes.  Or Jesse...  We can't get enough of sticking our fucking faces in people's private lives.  The fucking voyeuristic hotel room fucking nude tape.  We love it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We love it.  So what's the problem with this?  This is a byproduct of this shitty culture.  Yes.  That's what it is.  It's a byproduct of it.  It's people feel entitled to spy and to get information that's none of their fucking business.  Brilliant, Jimmy.  You're right.  But that's what this is.  You're right.  It's not about cyberbullying. 
[02:33:30]  Nope.  We got a guy on my Twitter, Bill Hart.  Hello, Bill!  Hart!  Bill Hart ran FT.  Nice fucking Twitter name.  That's easy to find if you're looking for followers.  He writes, two 13-year-olds tried bullying my 11-year-old.  They found out the hard way that he's been in MMA classes since he was nine.  Aw, shit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Wow.  If you think you got kind of a wimpier kid or a sensitive kid, get him into some fucking  self-defense classes immediately. 
[02:34:00]  That'd be good.  Nice spinning back kick to the face.  And Troy wants to defend our artistic gay kids.  Where's Troy, man?  Wow.  Oh, is he going to make a statement like one of those fucking celebrity tapes?  Should we call People Magazine?  I think this is an exclusive.  This, ladies and gentlemen, by the way, is not a recording.  This isn't one of the tapes that we've been playing here on the show.  This is our own Troy, and he will be speaking out, defending artistic gay kids in this environment 
[02:34:30]  of what we call cyberbullying.  No, Sam was fucking with me.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  Sam was fucking with me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh.  There he comes.  No, we were talking about boring.  I got pissed.  Sam is an ass and deserves to be bullied.  I'm told that this is not true, and Sam's coming in.  Oh, really?  Sam?  Sam, what happened?  What's the problem here?  I just think we should all...  You should make light of this, by the way.  No, I'm not.  I'm ashamed.  I'm gay-friendly.  I'm the friend of the gays here on the show.  You're made out with men on this very show.  It's nothing to me. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  But I just think that we should all be in an environment where we can express ourselves,  and Troy shouldn't express one opinion in the phone screen room and be afraid to say  it on the air.  Oh, what was his opinion in the phone screen room?  Well, because Travis was showing some pictures of when he was a kid, and I told Travis that  I wished he was picked on more as a kid so he would have killed himself.  I so would have probably molested Travis as a young child.  Of course.  Travis was very molestable.  When he's holding that cat, and he's got his long hair, and he dyed it and everything. 
[02:35:30]  You've got to see the pictures of him on the safety patrol.  No, he wasn't on safety patrol, was he?  He had a sash and everything.  But then Troy was talking about what's wrong with being different.  Kids don't have it figured out yet.  Is he preaching to people or screening calls?  What are you doing, Troy?  This was a conversation between Sam and I.  Oh.  Because Sam picked on a girl while the calls are building up?  Well, once the phone bank is filled.  Who's that? 
[02:36:00]  Travis is the safety patrol.  Oh, my God.  You look like one of the Duncan cover kids from Atomic Cafe.  Safety patrol was very coveted in elementary school.  What did you patrol Cox to make sure that no cum leaked out of him?  Your mouth.  I like that.  I like how your helmet doubles as a cereal bowl.  Look at it.  It's awful.  No, it does.  I swear.  It's just that.  And wasn't the sash supposed to be, like, white?  No, it was orange so you could see me.  No, the old days it was white and you had a badge on it. 
[02:36:30]  Not in the late 80s.  Ah, yeah, fuck.  Well, mine was the Hitler Youth.  Maybe that's what I was thinking.  People took me seriously when I was...  No, they didn't.  ...keeping people away from the water fountain before and after school.  Look at you.  You are so punchable.  Like, if you told me to do anything in school, I would have socked you, as they say.  People took me seriously.  Oh, my God.  Look at his big glasses.  That's fifth grade.  And, again, you were safety patrol.  Yeah.  What the fuck was wrong with you?  You want to be? 
[02:37:00]  Nothing.  I was very popular.  Why didn't you go into law enforcement?  Yeah, why aren't you a cop now?  It wasn't for me.  I got my fill with safety patrol.  Yeah.  And I did the morning announcements.  Do you have a taser?  No.  Baton?  No.  Sap?  What did you use to fucking lay some of these kids down when they tried to cross against  the green?  My stare.  Oh, man.  Yeah, with the...  Through those glasses?  Yeah.  With your doe eyes, you fruit.  Very cool.  You're very well-kempt.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  If you could grow a beard back then, you'd have been the mess you are now.  I was very innocent back then.  Yes, you were.  Straight A's.  Very good.  Safety patrol.  Yeah.  Please put those up on Twitter.  They're nothing short of fantastic.  Can I see that picture?  That's one or the other one?  Oh.  Nice exposure, dick.  Oh, safety patrol.  Fucking...  I wish you would have ended up like Eitan Pates. 
[02:38:00]  Too mean.  That's too mean.  What?  Adam?  No, no, no.  Just put on to say about Travis.  Yes.  Too mean.  Come on.  That's a meanie.  Too bad you didn't stand in front of your mother's vagina and guard against giant Jewish  cocks at my side.  Oh, shit.  What a callback.  She ran off of the Jew.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You should have been safety patrol of Jewish cocks. 
[02:38:30]  Look at us bullying.  You like doing better than you.  How about shoving that helmet up our vagina so a big Jewish dick couldn't go in there?  We're bullying.  We're cyberbullying him now.  Open a window.  He's ready to jump.  Kill yourself.  Mom.  Kill yourself.  You guys are offending Troy, though.  He doesn't like this type of stuff.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't play this game.  He's sitting back.  He's an artsy kid.  Yeah, he's an artsy kid.  Yeah, he is.  You're an artsy kid.  I don't like the bullying, either.  Oh, God.  What the fuck are you, Topo Gijo? 
[02:39:00]  He's wearing a little white suit.  He looks like he's waiting for the plane.  What a creep.  You're a dick.  I hope he winds up the same way as Herbie Village is, too.  I was seven, and that was my first dress-up party.  Really?  Whatever that meant.  Is that what they called it back then, when older men would take photos of you with other  older men?  Let's take a picture of your first dress-up party.  Now, change into this.  Yeah.  It's a prom dress.  He's wearing, like, a white tuxedo with a tie. 
[02:39:30]  Where are you going, a business meeting?  Look at you.  You're a little wreck.  Exactly.  You're dressed like fucking Pablo Escobar.  You were a very cute little kid there, Travis.  I was adorable.  I know.  You weren't adorable.  You had giant sleeves.  I was.  I was very cute.  Fucking AIDS arms.  Very popular.  Shut up, fucking teeny arms.  His fucking giant sleeves make me sick.  I certainly would.  By the way, I don't like your awkward polio legs, either.  How awful do his legs look?  It is like you're kind of crooked.  What happened? 
[02:40:00]  What happened to your legs, Travis?  A little fucking scoliosis.  Turn back that fucking overexposed shitty photo, please.  I have no idea.  I think I have great legs.  Did your parents have high hopes for you?  What is that?  They have very high hopes for me.  Yeah, because they dressed you like that.  What is that picture?  You're all bruised up.  What was that after the fire?  That's some finger painting.  Yeah.  Your finger painting on your body?  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, you show them how to.  Your body's a canvas.  Is that it, Uncle Paul?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me show you how to make the letter I.  You look like a little jungle boy. 
[02:40:30]  We had fun growing up.  Oh, did you?  Before it all went wrong.  When did you?  When mommy got for the Jew.  Before that Jew fucking stole your mother away.  When did you know it was all wrong?  When she was cooking and she was humming, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.  Standing bow-legged.  After she got a tremendous deep digging.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, two matzo balls on her nose. 
[02:41:00]  Travis, where are we at with this?  Have you talked to mommy lately?  No, I haven't.  In how long now?  Uh, it'll be, it's been nine and a half years.  What the fuck is that picture?  What?  It's you dressed up like Abraham Lincoln?  I was the lead in the play.  What play?  Abraham Lincoln.  What play do you think?  I thought the play was, look who fucked up our country.  Oh, see, because he doesn't like black people.  No, I'm just saying, you know, the Civil War and everything.  Suddenly he says that every day. 
[02:41:30]  No, no, it had nothing to do with that.  Oh, look at his little legs, still not working properly.  Little fucking cultish fawn legs.  God, those need braces, Forrest Gump.  I really wish that the guy who played Wilkes Booth was a method actor.  I know, the end of the play should be you laying on a bed with a pillow that's all red with your blood.  How funny was Otto when he was saying the guy shot him because he was six foot nine in the theater with a top hat.  He couldn't, he's like, this cocksuckus hat is on, honey, I can't see the band.  That was why he got shot. 
[02:42:00]  I can't see the band.  I can't see the band.  Cocksucker with his hat.  And he's holding George.  That's very funny.  That's fantastic.  I can't see the band.  You were the lead in the play as Lincoln.  And what was the play, though?  I have no idea.  I just remember that the beard was incredibly scratchy.  Did you have to recite the Gettysburg Address?  The beard.  Don't call her that.  Oh, you did.  Can you do it now?  No.  Four score and seven years ago?  That's all I know.  That's all you know?  Yeah.  But I know that I had to do that.  That was probably the age when Travis started playing undie flip. 
[02:42:30]  All right, well...  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  What is that, Travis?  I didn't...  What is it?  Does undie flip never come up on the air?  What's undie flip?  I forgot.  Sorry, dude.  I need to know what undie flip is.  He'll tell you.  It's a game he used to play.  Travis, what is undie flip?  I don't know if I can tell you without just laughing hysterically.  Well, we'll be the judge of whether you should laugh or not.  All right.  Undie flip is...  Look at him. 
[02:43:00]  He can't say it.  I have images, but what is undie flip?  It's me and my brother.  Oh, no.  This is bad already.  Oh, undie flip.  Uncle Paul knows.  Okay, what's undie flip?  He's fucking freaking out.  No, it's not.  It's just...  They've known about this for like four years. 
[02:43:30]  I've never heard of undie flip.  I feel deprived.  It's been saved, I guess.  So undie flip is me and my brother, we would take our underpants and put them down by...  He just starts fucking laughing.  We'd put them down by our feet.  Yeah.  You know, it was still on one of our legs.  Now, you're naked, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, so you and your brother...  You see how he was cleverly trying to get around that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a key part here.  You and your brother are totally naked. 
[02:44:00]  Now, your underwear are down by your...  Where?  By our foot.  Just on one ankle.  On one foot.  Yeah, just one ankle.  All right, one ankle.  And our kitchen, we had kind of like...  Lubricant.  Men.  Cameras rolling.  A bunch of jerking off guys.  A cracker.  With Polaroids.  Watching the fucking...  The Teft Boys. 
[02:44:30]  Goddamn Teft Boys know how to put on a show.  Look at Lincoln.  Undie flipping.  Yeah.  They'd make him put on the stovepipe hat, and they'd rape him.  They'd fucking...  They'd rape him with the fucking...  What's the thing that needs the dough?  Oh, a roller?  Yeah, the rolling pin.  A dough roller?  Yeah.  A rolling pin, that's it.  Hey, so what happened?  So it's one leg.  So yeah, our kitchen kind of had like...  It was almost like a ceiling before the ceiling.  I don't know how to explain it.  It's like a shirt before the shirt.  Yeah, it's called a floor, asshole. 
[02:45:00]  Or we would try and aim for the fan.  We had ceiling fans.  I believe the ceiling before the ceiling, what was it?  And then one part of the ceiling went higher than the rest of it?  Yeah, it was wooden, and there was maybe like five feet between our ceiling.  All right.  So you would aim for the fan?  It's almost cathedraled a little.  Yeah, or the fan.  I'm a big fan.  So you'd take the underwear on one foot and flip it off your foot.  Yeah, we would, you know, kick it. 
[02:45:30]  Now, I do this going to bed at night, usually.  I'll take it and try to flip it into the hamper.  Yeah, but we're going for, you know, severe elevation.  But it's never with my brother.  And you're not nude?  Not, well, you know, but I'm alone or, you know, with somebody.  And that is not my brother.  So we did that.  And does not have a penis.  All right, so we do things differently.  Yeah, yeah.  So you'd flip it up into the ceiling fan.  Yeah.  And it would whoosh away.  No, no, no.  And hopefully skid-marked underwear would hit your brother in the face. 
[02:46:00]  Well, the ceiling fan would be usually inactive.  Oh, okay, good.  And then we would see if we can get it on top.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a fun game.  Yeah.  It was called undie flip.  Homosexual.  Exactly.  No wonder she left for the Jew.  What are you talking about?  Your mom.  She didn't have to deal with fucking undie flip.  That's just one of the games we played.  With the new family that she got that was better than her old family.  That included you.  New family.  The horrid son.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I say that?  What?  That was pretty bad. 
[02:46:30]  Troy doesn't like that stuff.  I don't care.  Yeah, Troy.  Enough about me.  Troy, the artsy kid.  Troy likes people to be nice.  He thinks, you know, the creative kids get made fun of.  And, you know, everybody's a conformist.  You know, that's what he was saying.  You know, he's like non-conformist.  Troy, was that what we were saying?  Yeah, yeah, it's Madison Square Ga-Ga.  Yeah, he has no problem wearing a Lady Gaga shirt.  Okay.  Anyway, he was just bragging that he was picking on everybody.  I was explaining stories.  I wasn't bragging.  And I was just like, you know, do you want everybody to be exactly like you? 
[02:47:00]  You know?  I mean, there are kids out there that are different.  They grow up and, you know, become different things.  And I got picked on a lot as a kid.  Now, why?  What was your problem?  Like, obviously, it probably wasn't a problem.  But people, kids at that age will interpret somebody with maybe more of a flamboyant personality as a problem child.  Right.  What was your deal?  I was a little weird.  What was weird about you?  I just looked weird.  I was very tall.  Had big ears.  Just very awkward looking. 
[02:47:30]  Wore weird clothes.  But, you know, if you were kind of like fun and shit, people will overlook that stuff.  Yeah, I was a little quiet.  Just kind of stuck to myself.  And I got picked on a lot and I just learned how to fight.  So you had to duke it out with people?  Yeah.  Are you a good fighter?  I haven't been in a fight in quite some time.  But there was a period of time I was getting into a lot of fights.  Were you good at it?  I was okay.  You defended yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah, you didn't get your ass.  What sport did they walk into the locker room and they saw you with another boy's athletic supporter over your face? 
[02:48:00]  And you were singing, I'm a little teapot.  Were you undie flipping in the locker room with Travis?  Someone's jock onto your face.  The first real good fight I had was in high school.  The captain of the football team was just repeatedly picking on me and picking on me.  I love this movie.  And did he put tape on your ass and rip it off and then have to go to detention?  And his father yelled at him?  Actually, there was a whole ordeal, but I got him fired, not deliberately, from a job that we both worked at. 
[02:48:30]  Good job.  Good job.  And, well, I had pneumonia and he wanted me to work and he forced me to work and he got fired for it.  Anyway.  Faggy pneumonia.  So he picked on me for the past three months.  This guy was massive, big, huge guy.  Yeah.  And I just had enough one day and I had a can of mace and I waited for him as he walked into school.  And there was a bus entrance and he, I mean, this kid would throw me up against...  Is that what you called your asshole? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  He would throw me up against the lockers and bang my head off the lockers and it was,  I just had enough of it.  So I was waiting for him with a can of mace and he, he, he walked up the stairs and I flicked  him off and he came over to me.  He was like, you know, what the fuck is this?  And I sprayed him with mace and then I just swung and I just clocked him as hard as I  could in the face.  And I hit him so hard.  I shit my pants. 
[02:49:30]  And then, wow, that's a great punch.  Didn't that happen in Rocky four?  Yeah.  That fucking rolls.  So I just, I, I just got on top of him and I just unloaded on his face and I had a big  dump in my pants.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did he smush your fucking dump in his face?  No.  That would have been great if he would have just smear your shit like a fucking ape.  Just smear your shit in his face.  Yeah.  That would have been great.  Oh, mace and shit.  So what happened?  I got expelled.  Oh, really?  So you got expelled for that?  Yeah.  He told on you or someone saw it? 
[02:50:00]  Well, I mean, it was a whole ordeal.  I mean, it was right in the bus in your pants.  Why did you get expelled for defending yourself?  Because I, I maced him.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  Did they know you shit your pants?  I was sitting in the principal's office and I stunk up the whole thing.  Nice.  How old were you again?  Uh, it was like junior year of high school.  So like 17.  17, you're shitting your pants.  Yeah.  I hit him so hard.  I mean, I put everything I had into that punch.  Did you ever see him again?  He rocked.  Uh, occasionally.  Yeah.  He left me alone.  Yeah.  I bet.  Yeah.  He never, he just kind of puts his head down.  He punches you.  He shits his pants.  He maces you.  Yeah.  You gotta watch that guy.  Yeah.  You're crazy, man. 
[02:50:30]  All right, Troy.  All right, no bullying for you.  Exactly.  You guys want to know you first?  That's how you handle it.  You don't jump off a bridge.  You shit your pants.  Exactly.  You fucking mace him like a coward, then shit your pants like a cancer patient.  Then push it in his face.  Doing a rock and a hut, please.  Oh my God.  Do we have to look at these fucking photos now?  You shit your pants.  You can't win, Rock.  This guy will shit his pants inside of three rounds. 
[02:51:00]  It could have beat old Wetwoods.  You guys want to hear more celebrities talking about cyberbullying?  I just shit my pants.  Yes.  Do we?  I love cyberbullying.  We got Cindy Lauper left, Ellen DeGeneres, Kathy Griffin.  Oh, hi, it's Cindy Lauper.  I don't think anybody should bully me.  Just because she has a wacky boy.  This September, when kids should be going back to school and celebrating a new school year  and learning new things, four young men took their lives. 
[02:51:30]  They took their lives because they were bullied.  They were bullied for being gay.  Was suspected of being gay.  This is an epidemic.  Oh, four people is an epidemic?  Look, I'm not trying to be insensitive, but four people...  You gotta do the numbers.  ...does not an epidemic make.  No.  I'm sorry.  I understand.  It's bad.  I'm not fucking saying it's not. 
[02:52:00]  Look, I'm not.  But four people and calling it an epidemic is a little fucking dramatic.  Cindy.  Teenagers have been committing suicide forever.  Because of Aussie records.  Everyone knows that's why they do it.  It's not.  It's not his fault.  Of course it is.  He makes you want to live.  Oh, does he?  What about suicide solution, man?  But it's against alcohol.  They used to blame the records.  Now they're blaming cyberbullying.  Yeah, cyberbullying now.  It's just everything. 
[02:52:30]  Come on.  Kids will always off themselves.  Whatever.  Then they blame Dungeons and Dragons at one point, too.  There's always something to blame.  The darkness of Dungeons and Dragons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kids to kill themselves.  There are many others, and this goes on all the time.  If you are being bullied and you are contemplating suicide, please, instead, make a phone call.  Call the Trevor Project helpline.  Yeah.  Take a moment. 
[02:53:00]  Reconnect.  There are people out there to help you.  Reconnect like docking?  Maybe you shouldn't name your kid Trevor.  Yeah.  That's a bad one.  Or Travis.  Or Travis.  If you are a parent who suspects your child is being bullied, please get involved.  Smack them around.  There are organizations that can help you.  There's P-Flag, for instance.  What?  It was started by parents whose children were gay.  Please get involved. 
[02:53:30]  If you are a parent who suspects their kid is bullying another child for their sexual orientation,  please get involved.  You'll lose your kid to hate and fear.  When a child or a young person acts out in hate and fear, you lose them.  It wrecks their life.  We need all our kids.  Please get involved and teach them that different is okay.  I'm bored with that one.  You want to move on to the next one?  I was made fun of. 
[02:54:00]  I had one pair of sneakers that I had to clean the corrals in and go to school in, and my sneakers  smelled like horse shit.  Every day I went to school and I smelled like horse shit.  Did you have to fight your way through school?  No, because I was a faggot.  I was a little pussy.  I got smacked around.  I had fucking zits that were horrid.  So why didn't you jump off a bridge?  Because I...  What caused you not to jump off a bridge?  No, I didn't want to die.  I figured it would get better.  That's a good point.  Eventually, something would happen, and then Buzz came in and sucked my dick, and everything 
[02:54:30]  got better.  My brother introduced me to pot.  It was a wonderful life.  It went from black and white to color.  It was fantastic.  All of a sudden, I could give a shit that my sneakers were green and smelled like horse shit.  Maybe they should pass out pot in junior high.  Yes.  That would mellow everyone.  The little homosexual children would love it.  It's coming very close to that in California, anyway.  Yeah, it really is.  We're pulling for California, aren't we?  Yes.  I honestly can't wait.  I think it's actually pretty exciting.  I think you'll see pot legalized probably in the next 10 years. 
[02:55:00]  In our lifetime.  It's going to be really interesting.  Alcohol legal, pot not.  It's just ridiculous.  It's silly.  It's ridiculous.  Silly.  I had no idea.  Already in Massachusetts, you can carry under an ounce.  It's just like a speeding ticket.  You'd pay a stupid fine.  You still just get a ticket.  Right, right.  I'm getting there.  They don't arrest you.  It's because we're so desperate in this country.  We need to make new fucking income for this country.  That's the only reason.  And open up the prisons to people that are fucking like raping people. 
[02:55:30]  There's too many people that are arrested for pot possession.  Who gives a shit?  All right.  Let's move on to Ellen DeGeneres.  Ah, this is what I want to hear.  Yes.  Oh, I mean, I absolutely don't care.  I am devastated over the death of 18-year-old Tyler Clemente.  Devastated?  If you don't know, Tyler was a bright student at Rutgers University whose life was...  Not too bright.  Yeah.  Apparently not.  Cover up that webcam when you're sucking a dick, stupid.  Exactly. 
[02:56:00]  Look at the fucking webcam.  Damn, if the light's on, stop it.  Put a fucking shirt over it.  I've done that.  Like, there's so many different ways you can access your computer remotely these days.  If I'm just not sure about something or if I just get a weird feeling,  I will absolutely cover up that little pinhole camera in an iMac or whatever.  Or just fold the fucking screen down.  It's done.  You never know.  They won't.  It's not...  Look, the thing is, him being gay is not the issue.  Maybe that's what depressed him.  Invasion of Pride...  I keep saying it.  It's Invasion of Pride. 
[02:56:30]  But it's such...  It's such a sense of entitlement we have learned to feel to see people's personal eyes strewn all over the front yard.  Yeah.  We're morbidly curious.  We love it.  We're very voyeuristic.  We fucking love the details.  We love it.  We love to hear, who did he cheat with?  What happened?  Oh, he said nigger on the phone in a private comedy.  What happened?  What did he do wrong?  All things we're not supposed to know about.  There's audio.  There's video.  I gotta hear it.  I gotta see it.  I gotta do...  We can't get enough. 
[02:57:00]  And then we wonder why two college students are gonna do something shitty and invasive.  Yeah.  It's not a mystery as to why they did that.  Yeah.  Where'd they get the idea?  Where'd they get the fuck?  Where'd they see it done before?  How about Perez Hilton?  How about...  It's like, you're a part of the problem, scumbag.  TMZ.  All those shows.  You're a part of this morbid voyeurism.  You're a part of this throwing people's personal lives all over the place.  Yep.  Things that are not the public's business.  You make that acceptable.  So don't sit there and wonder why two dumb college students all of a sudden... 
[02:57:30]  Look, when you're 18, if you think your roommate is blowing guys, you're not mature enough to go,  Wow, this is an agonizing thing that he has to keep a secret.  He's gonna kill himself.  You're like, I gotta get this on tape.  You're not looking at the consequences of how devastating that is.  Right.  But let's not act shocked when we're all fucking guilty of it.  We love it.  Yeah.  We love it as a country.  Where is that side of the story?  Where are people telling that side of the story?  Because they're all a part of it.  If they videotaped this kid and they showed him and they go, he's a faggot, then that's the issue. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  But I think the problem is this dummy was just spying on his roommate being a creep.  And it's like, holy shit, look, he's engaged in some sex here.  But because...  Check it out.  Where was this voice of outrage when other details were coming out that we found interesting?  Yeah.  There was no voice of outrage.  We love it.  Yeah.  So stop being dishonest and stop pretending we don't understand why people spy. 
[02:58:30]  We fucking can't get enough.  Damn, we should have had a webcam on you.  Oh my God, right?  Just don't tell me.  That could have went viral right there.  It's funny, with Paris Hilton or whatever, when that came out, all these mock sex tapes that come out,  we're kind of trained that that's acceptable now.  That's great.  Love that.  It's hot.  It makes you famous.  It's...  What?  Lindsay Lohan photographed with a hypodermic needle?  Oh my God.  Where's the picture?  I gotta see it.  Yeah, didn't...  Hey, didn't...  By the way, didn't Perez Hilton get in trouble for showing, like, Miley Cyrus with her fucking legs open or something? 
[02:59:00]  Yes.  Wow, really?  That's a way to treat a teenager, to fucking show what her panties are, her pussy?  That could have been devastating to her.  That hypocrite.  Fucking phony.  He's the biggest fucking phony as far as a cyberbullying goes.  And I mean, just as research, Danny, punch that picture up, just so I could research it and see exactly what...  Holy fuck.  Wow.  So a paparazzi camera catching, whether it's Brittany or somebody else's pussy sticking out...  Yeah.  ...is put out on every website, and it's acceptable, but this college student is a terrible guy if he wants to secretly film it. 
[02:59:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's very similar.  Believe me, these college students are pieces of shit.  And Perez Hilton is speaking out, is so guilty of what you're talking about.  Of course he is.  And I'm not defending the college students, they're scumbags.  No, obviously, yeah.  But you can't just put the blame there and act like we have no idea how it happened.  It's part of our culture.  Yep.  This is what we become.  We're a shit culture, and that's what we get.  His life was senselessly cut short.  He was outed as being gay on the internet, and he killed himself. 
[03:00:00]  Something must be done.  This month alone, there have been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide,  like 13-year-old Seth Walsh in Tehachapi, California.  What?  13-year-old Asher Brown in Cypress, Texas.  And 15-year-old Billy Lucas in Greensburg, Indiana.  Billy!  This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone that teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country,  and the death rate is climbing. 
[03:00:30]  One life lost in a senseless way is tragic.  Four lives lost is a crisis.  You know what?  It's not a crisis.  By the way...  It sucks.  Trust me.  It sucks.  For those families and the friends of those...  More people kill themselves as adolescents because they just don't feel accepted in any way.  Fuck the...  It doesn't matter if they're gay or anything.  Or they don't feel like they're performing well in life.  Their family life sucks.  It has nothing to do with...  You can't just point out one part of this.  You should not have the whole fucking thing. 
[03:01:00]  And as far as her saying that he was outed as being gay on the internet, I mean, it does suck.  I'm not saying it doesn't suck.  But it's like every celebrity rag outs people.  Oh my god, they love catching someone being gay.  They couldn't get enough fucking Ricky Martin pictures.  They couldn't get enough pictures of this guy or that guy.  Neither could I.  Is he gay?  Who didn't?  Him and the other fella doing yoga with a towel.  Oh.  The jet ski.  But it's like the whole fucking shitty country loves to catch two guys walking together.  Is this one a lesbian?  They speculate on who's gay.  They forced Ricky Martin out, basically. 
[03:01:30]  Of course they did.  With the pictures they got of him.  Stop acting shocked.  John Travolta smooching on the steps of that plane.  Dude, it happens everywhere.  Yep.  And then they think that it's like, because this guy was out on the internet, how could  anyone do that?  Yeah.  They've trained people how to fucking do this shit.  They've trained you that it's acceptable.  And we have not stressed as a country, because we're fucking curious, how sickening these invasions  of people's private lives are. 
[03:02:00]  Not one person came out when Dog the Bounty Hunter was saying nigger on the phone and said,  yeah, the guy's an asshole.  But this is not our fucking business.  Between family members.  Right.  Not one major paper came out and said, Tiger Woods' private life.  Yeah.  It's sickening that we should look at this.  It's not our business.  And that's not invasion of privacy in the same way that this was?  Of course it is.  It's not cyberbullying.  It's invasion of privacy.  And the news does it all the time.  These rags do it all the time.  The papers do it.  Yeah.  They all do it.  Perez Hilton does it. 
[03:02:30]  And that's why Ellen doesn't bother me as much, because I don't think she does it.  Where's that fucking side?  That's the issue.  But Ellen isn't fucking speaking against the mainstream media that does this constantly.  Every day on the news, you'll see some invasion of privacy.  Invasion of privacy.  Because that should be viewed as the taboo.  Because let's say the guy was not gay.  Let's say this guy was masturbating and was humiliated and killed himself.  Or let's say he was...  How big was his dick?  Hopefully juicy.  All right.  And his balls are hairy or not? 
[03:03:00]  What if he had low hangers?  I just want the details, Jim.  What if he was fooling around with a girl whose father thought she was a virgin?  So it was a heterosexual thing, and in a humiliated way, she killed herself.  It's not about being gay.  It's about the fucking invasion of privacy.  I don't mean to keep repeating it.  It's the thing I hate about our culture.  The sexuality does not come into this.  No, it's part of it.  Yeah, but I think in this one, the invasion of privacy is the bigger picture.  Absolutely.  Lost is a crisis.  And these are just the stories we hear about. 
[03:03:30]  How many other teens have we lost?  How many others are suffering in silence?  Being a teenager and figuring out who you are is hard enough without someone attacking you.  I know who I was.  My heart is breaking for their families, for their friends, and for our society that continues to let this happen.  These kids needed us, and we have an obligation to change this.  There are messages everywhere that validate this kind of bullying and taunting, and we have to make it stop.  We can't let intolerance and ignorance take another kid's life, and I want anyone out there who feels different and alone to know that I know how you feel, and there is help out there, and you can find support in your community. 
[03:04:00]  If you need someone to talk to, or if you want to get involved, there are some really great organizations listed on our website.  Things will get easier.  People's minds will change, and you should be alive to see it.  You know what?  She's doing good.  I like Ellen a lot, man, and I think she's genuine and sincere.  But if you want to fight stuff like this, begin attacking all of these outlets, whether it's Radar Online or all of the ones that, A, help celebrities by showing you. 
[03:04:30]  Begin attacking them, for real attacking them, for the invasions.  Don't support these invasions of privacy.  That's how you start doing something like that.  Such shit.  We got Kathy Griffin and Perez Hilton left.  Kathy Griffin's just a goofball.  I like Kathy, too.  I mean, Perez is the only one that really annoys me.  Why don't we move right on to Perez Hilton?  Because he's guilty of it. 
[03:05:00]  He is the biggest cyberbully out there.  His site is fucking huge.  Hypocritical fucking cunt.  He's a cunt.  Yeah.  Uh, cocaine dripping out of noses.  I cannot stand this motherfucker.  Uh, and he's going to speak out about cyberbullying.  Yeah, let's hear this.  This is completely insane.  It's disgusting.  It's what he does.  That's his job.  He's made a fine living.  His career is cyberbullying.  Uh, not just Hollywood.  Enough.  Anybody in the news. 
[03:05:30]  And, and, and, and calling little girls whores and shit.  And people that are right.  People that are not even of age.  Exactly.  So.  And showing that private shot or showing private shots that would be humiliating to someone.  This motherfucker.  You gotta take the good with the bad.  He would put a humiliating photo that someone was not posing for up in a second.  Uh-huh.  And embarrass somebody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dickhead.  Why isn't anyone calling him out on this?  Because he's gay and he's fucking speaking out on this.  No one listens to us. 
[03:06:00]  You gotta work on fucking eggshells.  People just think we're fucking goofball shock jocks.  But how about someone calls Perez Hilton out on this shit?  Yeah.  Look at all the cum bubble shots.  Oh.  Look at the cock shots that he draws.  Yeah.  Big fucking cocks.  Yeah, Perez Hilton.  Exactly.  He draws cocks in people's faces and then wonders why.  Where this homophobia comes from.  You're presenting a dick in a man's mouth as if it's this bad thing. 
[03:06:30]  An insult.  As an insult.  And an insult to somebody.  Yet you don't want people to talk about it like it's an insult.  You phony.  You're a fucking hypocritical cock.  You phony motherfucker.  You're a cocksucker, hypocritical fuckwad.  And his argument would be, well, I do it to women, too.  Oh, shut it.  We all understand the difference between a dick drawn in a girl's face and the implications of that and a dick drawn in a girl's face.  We all get that.  Right.  So don't play that semantics game.  Let's go to his dumb audio.  All right. 
[03:07:00]  Hello.  My name is Perez.  You may know me from my website.  You know, my website where I draw cum bubbles and cocks on pictures.  Yeah.  And I sell that website.  Yeah.  PerezHilton.com.  And this video is directed and made with love for those of you who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and having a difficult time being whom you were born.  If you're in high school, if you're in middle school and you're finding it difficult to go to school, to be accepted by your family, I'm here to tell you it gets better. 
[03:07:30]  Not everything gets better.  You'll still get pimples like I have on my nose.  But most everything and I'll get that out.  Just get a little rub, a little cum on that.  And that'll clear up your pimples on your nose.  I hate this guy.  Fucking wad he is. 
[03:08:00]  And not because he's gay.  He's just that.  I hate him because he contributes nothing.  Absolutely.  He is.  He's like when Wall Street would liquidate.  They would capitalize on other people's things.  He's just a blogger who contributes nothing.  He's not funny.  He's not a good writer.  He's a redditor.  He's not creative.  Fucking asshole.  He's simply a poster of information.  He stinks.  Our pal Brendan's on the line who, of course, is a big part of whatwouldtylerdurdendo.com.  Oh, yes.  www.tdd.com.  Brendan, what's up? 
[03:08:30]  Hey, my fellow, good morning.  I just wanted to mention that Perez actually takes credit for outing Lance Bass because for years he would go on his website and scream that Bass was gay even though he hadn't come out of the closet yet.  And when he eventually did, Perez actually took credit for it and said he was right to do it to out other gay kids.  And there was a show called Kyle XY, I think, on Disney Channel.  And he tried to out that kid, too, for years.  So he's cyberbullying. 
[03:09:00]  I mean, Lance Bass didn't feel like telling the world he was gay yet.  Oh, yeah.  He did the exact same thing these kids did.  He went on the Internet and said this kid who was trying to have a private life is gay and we should all know about it.  So why is no one calling – you guys should call him out on your site for it because you guys have a big site and you have a big voice, man.  And it really is – it's amazing how they're all concentrating only on the fact that the kid who killed himself, which was very sad, was gay. 
[03:09:30]  But that, to me, is not the issue.  The issue is invasion of privacy and it's all this shit.  And these guys – and Perez is guilty of that.  It's what he does.  I'm a piece of shit, though.  At least I admit it.  I don't pretend to be anything different.  But, dude, you have a site.  And the difference is you're not on – you're not on the Miss America pageant making self-righteous, sanctimonious statements about what's right and wrong and then going on your site and drawing cum on people's eyeballs.  You know, it's like what Perez Hilton is doing is he's a dirtbag and he's a cornball and he draws dicks on faces. 
[03:10:00]  And then he tries to be this fucking – this poignant changer of social issues and he's an asshole.  Yeah, he actually thinks he's noble and that he's doing something important.  Yeah.  He's just – he's not.  He's just a piece of shit.  And, yeah, I think people are catching on to that.  But I have no idea what it is.  But now he's going to come out and speak up on this subject?  The guy should crawl in a fucking hole when subjects like this come up because he's one of the biggest perpetrators. 
[03:10:30]  Fucking asshole.  Oh, and like Jimmy, he helped establish the entire culture.  He took it to a whole new intimate, personal level.  You know, it was always in magazines like people and things like that.  But he just really made it much more personal and vicious.  Well, who was the bra that was peeped on through the hotel room?  The gruff of ESPN.  I forgot her name all of a sudden.  Aaron Andrews? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Aaron Andrews.  I'm sure he posted those photos all over his site, right?  Oh, yeah.  Now, I'm sure you guys did too, but at least you know who you are.  And, you know, Perez can't play it both ways is the point we're making today.  Yeah, you're right, dude.  You know, if you're posting these pictures that shouldn't be out there to begin with  and then turn around and you're all about stopping cyberbullying, it doesn't make sense.  Yeah, he's more than happy to call people fags.  But if you say the same thing to him, he's outraged. 
[03:11:30]  Right.  And if you have pride in your sexuality, why would you call, like, other guys fags?  Well, gay guys do that.  Yeah, but what is that about?  Like, hey, queer, hey, fag, sweetie, sister, girls, ladies, I guess.  How about when Perez posted those leaked Clay Aiken photos of his, like, shirtless webcam flirtiness that was happening?  Yeah, look at what he's doing online.  Did Perez Hilton do that? 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yes, yeah.  I'm sure Clay Aiken didn't really want that out there.  So I guess that's acceptable.  So what are you talking about, Perez Hilton?  And that came from the Internet.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Since you know how hard it is to be gay, and you know how devastating it is to have that outed, you motherfucker.  Why are you trying to, why, because they're celebrities, they can't commit suicide?  What happened if that humiliated Clay Aiken and he killed himself?  He could have very easily jumped off a bridge or something because of that.  I just posted the picture of somebody else.  He put them up online.  Fucking hypocrite. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, where's all the respect and love for transgendered or gay people's privacy?  Since you know how hard it is to be in that situation, you're saying that since you came out, they should live the same kind of life you should?  They should have the same comfort level you should?  Don't you think Clay Aiken would have been upset to see his womanly tits on a line like that?  He really has an awful, I thought, I know I have awful tits, but he has abs and man tits.  I don't know how you do that.  That's a little weird.  That's a weird combo.  Wow.  Brendan's gone.  Did Brendan leave?  Maybe his phone fucked up. 
[03:13:00]  Okay.  All right, let's get back to the Perez Hilton video blog.  Yes, please.  Amazing stuff.  My God.  But most everything in life will get better because you'll be older, you'll be wiser, you'll have experience, and if you're in a really unpleasant situation in a year, in two years, in three years, in a few years, you'll be out of there.  I know it may seem like a lot of time now, but when you start to get older and you're 32 like myself, a year, two years, three years is not that long. 
[03:13:30]  I remember when I was 15 and gay, I was so closeted.  I went to an all-boy Jesuit school in Miami.  And I remember once vividly in theology class, a.k.a. religion, the teacher said, you know, there are studies that say that 10% of everybody is gay.  And I was like, wow, that's a really revolutionary thought for a Christian school for a Catholic teacher. 
[03:14:00]  And then she had to, of course, add on to that by saying, but you boys are not like everybody else.  So I don't think that 10% of you are gay.  Your percentage is way less.  Maybe it's 1%.  And actually, the percentage was way more than 10.  Oh, really?  But high school wasn't the easiest of times for me.  And I think one of the reasons... 
[03:14:30]  Is this a soliloquy?  Listen to him rambling about it.  He's not talking about cyberbullying, though.  No.  He's just talking about being gay.  It's me being gay.  You get it.  And I think one of the reasons for that also was I didn't have that many people to look up to.  I didn't have role models, good, bad, or any kind of models on television.  I remember the only gay person I saw on TV when I was young was Pedro Zamora on The Real World. 
[03:15:00]  Now, I love that we have a whole gamut of people, from Neil Patrick Harris, who is amazing, to myself, whom a lot of people hate.  Oh, you.  You cornball.  You cornball.  Oh, boy.  Once again, we refer to his website.  It runs the whole gamut.  With the cum bubbles and the cocks.  From Neil Patrick Harris to, yeah, the guy that draws cum bubbles. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, doing a great job, great service for gay people, drawing cum on people's faces and dicks in their faces as a form of insult and humiliation.  Real service to the gay community, you phony motherfucker.  What a...  Ridiculous.  Way to stand tall.  To myself, whom a lot of people hate and find annoying, but I would have loved to have had me around when I was a teenager.  Why?  You would have outed you, you fucker.  You would have outed you and humiliated you. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  You would have been the first one.  I bet he'd have gone back and sucked his own dick, though.  That's what he means.  Like, back to the future.  You could go back, suck your own cock.  Because I would have either looked at Perez Hilton and found him extremely annoying or thought he was really cool,  but loved the fact that Perez Hilton was able to create something from nothing.  Can I please pause?  Here's what...  Oh my God, is he deluded. 
[03:16:30]  What you should say is, I would look at Perez Hilton and realize that our country is indeed moving into a fact,  a place where nothing in your private life is sacred.  Yeah.  And it is okay to humiliate you for being who you are.  Because that's what you do, scumbag.  Because vultures like Perez Hilton are out there.  You vulture.  You humiliate people because of how they look or what they're doing or who...  You make your living humiliating people.  And then you wonder, why would somebody humiliate somebody else?  You are a despicable, phony motherfucker. 
[03:17:00]  He could be the number one cyber bully out there.  Yeah.  I mean, how many hits does this dumb website get?  He wishes...  Millions and millions a week, easily.  He wishes he was there for him.  He's...  Yeah.  Really?  He's a big part of the problem.  So you could out yourself.  So you wish...  He wishes Perez Hilton was there for him, so when he was 15, he could go online and feel better about feeling humiliated  by seeing other people publicly humiliated.  Yeah.  Shut your face.  This guy is such a...  Shut up.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  He ate something from nothing and become successful and not have to be something he's not.  Perez Hilton is very gay and proud of it.  So what?  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  So what?  That's just to do with you being a scumbag and a vulture.  Yeah, we don't give a shit about that part of it.  I don't care who you fuck.  You're a vulture.  Right.  We have a problem with you being a vulture.  And what did you create?  The name is not even yours.  Hilton you took from Paris Hilton.  You just take everybody else's personal life. 
[03:18:00]  What did you create from nothing?  What did you create?  Invasion of privacy he created.  You're a poster of pictures and stories and rumors and innuendo.  I could give a shit if your dick smells like fucking duty.  So you should be proud of who you are because it's not a choice to be who you are.  You were made this way.  As Lady Gaga says, you were born this way.  So if you're having a hard time, talk to someone. 
[03:18:30]  Shut up, bitch.  Talk to a friend.  Bitch.  Talk to your parents if you can.  No, you can't.  Talk to a stranger.  Call a hotline.  Just don't talk to Perez Hilton because he'll print it.  Talk about your feelings because suicide is never the solution to difficult times.  I have been there.  I went through a point in my life where I was suicidal.  Unfortunately, I was so depressed and miserable.  What a shame that he didn't do it. 
[03:19:00]  That would have been a nice solution.  Oh, what a fucking pleasure that would have been for all the people that he makes miserable  on a daily fucking basis.  You fucking come here, dude asshole.  I was so depressed and miserable, hating life.  I felt like I was in a black tunnel.  And I saw no black tunnel.  Black tunnel, what's that all about?  Now we're talking.  Now we're getting sexy.  Now it's getting sexy here.  Come on.  Wow.  Black tunnel.  Trying to pull out the gerbil.  Open it up. 
[03:19:30]  And I saw no light at the end of it.  Oh, wow.  I was thinking daily how I would kill myself.  Today, I'm going to slip my wrist.  Today, I'm going to hang myself.  Today, I'm going to jump off my building.  I'm going to go to Oregon and find a horse.  Time.  Over the course of time, my problem got better.  Things changed.  I got fired from that job that I hated.  And it was a blessing.  So things that you may be experiencing now that you think are bad.  In hindsight, in the future, may turn out to be some of the best things that ever happened to you. 
[03:20:00]  So also, and in closing, email me.  Closing.  My email is Perez at PerezHilton.com.  Nice plug.  You need somebody to talk to.  Another plug for his website.  If you want advice, if you're having a hard time, I am here.  Listen, gay kids, don't fucking email Perez Hilton.  He's there for you.  Somehow it'll be on his website.  He'll expose you for being gay in some fucked up way.  How about this?  That's our message to the gay kids. 
[03:20:30]  Don't fucking email Perez Hilton.  He can't be trusted.  If a celebrity.  If your secret or your photos.  How about, let's just say a conservative celebrity.  Right.  Let's say someone who he doesn't like emailed him and said, look, I'm a homosexual or I'm a lesbian.  And I want that.  That motherfucker.  You know he would find a way to embarrass them on the website and get himself some more.  What a jizz bucket.  What a douche.  If you want advice, if you're having a hard time, I am here for you.  Okay?  So know that you are special and you are loved. 
[03:21:00]  And you're 15, younger or older, and your life and your spirit is of great value.  Bye.  Hey, you know what?  This is good.  Perez Hilton.  I don't want to give out his Twitter name, but this guy just writes, trust me, gays hate him too.  Oh, good.  That's good to know.  Yes.  I still have your number so I can text you.  What a fucking phony hypocrite. 
[03:21:30]  And someone on Instant Feedback, fair enough, Brian in Alabama.  What about the WWTDD guy?  He's in the same league as Perez.  Brendan said.  He said that.  He goes, look, I'm a dirtbag.  I know it or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not trying to be something he's not.  Which is fine.  The problem is Perez is.  He's trying to play it both ways.  He's not there.  And that's why we have a problem.  And Brendan, from what would Tyler Durden do, is not on fucking.  Look, yeah.  He's not speaking out about cyberbullying.  Right.  Cyberbullying and gayness.  We're dirtbags when it comes to this type of thing.  Of course we are.  But we throw a lot of fucking intelligence at you, too, as far as the topic goes. 
[03:22:00]  A lot and a little.  A lot.  A lot.  I say a lot.  Okay.  I'm way more honest than what fucking Perez just said.  I'm bird shit about it.  But we're not being self-righteous about it.  That's what I fucking know.  I would never.  Believe me.  I know a lot of stuff about people's personal lives that I would never say on the radio or  on stage.  I just wouldn't do it.  Thank you, by the way, Jimmy.  No, everybody already knows.  Believe me.  That fucking, the black guys. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, the house.  If I had a photo of you with a black dick in your mouth, I could not put it out.  Hold off of that.  It would be great on everybody.  It would be my reputation.  Well, not in my eyes.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst Opie and Anthony in Sirius XM.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  Stop.  Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is Iraq. 
[03:23:00]  Welcome back.  How are you?  How are things going?  I really don't care.  In this segment, Intern David, one of the most requested people to be replayed on this  show, next to Patrice O'Neill, Louis C.K., and that god-awful dragon wagon call from  2004.  But Intern David is up there in that upper echelon of requests for this show.  In this particular bit, Intern David meets porn star Lisa Sparks.  So, what did we do?  Oh, David got a little too friendly with Lisa Sparks, and somebody was in the audience 
[03:23:30]  that didn't take too kindly to David's advances.  Intern David and Lisa Sparks.  Here you go.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony in Sirius XM.  All right.  Hey, are we ready?  Is it soundproof?  We're going to attempt something here.  In the other room, cutting IDs and helping Derek with some lines.  All right.  We got Lisa Sparks.  I told him he's in a soundproof room because...  You didn't tell him she does porn.  Did we say it over there?  No, we didn't.  We said something about her big tits, but we didn't say... 
[03:24:00]  Jim, you said Lisa Sparks is coming in, and she...  I don't know if you alluded to it or not.  It doesn't matter.  We're going to say she's just a listener.  And what Lisa's going to do, I told her, she's not going to tell David she's in porn.  She's going to sit.  She has a very short little skirt on, and she took her panties off, so she's going to  kind of flash him while they're talking, just show her pussy a little bit, and we're  going to try to get David to talk to her, and I think that Anthony should indicate to  the audience, whenever we catch him, A, looking up her skirt, or staring at her big 
[03:24:30]  hands, she does have big, beautiful tits.  Give him a little.  Yeah, whenever we catch him doing that, is there anything else we could get him to do?  Yeah, we got other things.  But we can tell...  After the big reveal, we got some other things we could get.  No, no, no, I mean, like, before we reveal.  Is there anything else that we can indicate to the audience, like...  No, it'll be obvious when Ant rings the bell that he's just staring at her big tits  and her can't. 
[03:25:00]  Let's bring her in.  Let's just cross-body block him so his face falls right in her pussy.  Let's bring her in and just talk to her before...  Mark, can't.  We're going to bring her in before.  All right.  Here's Lisa right here today.  Hello.  Lisa, before I get to you, I just got to apologize, because it's all about apologies these days  on radio.  You know that dumb statue I was just making fun of in Galveston, Texas?  Uh-oh, what was it?  Well, the locals there had such a horrific hurricane back at the turn of the century,  I believe, somewhere around 1908, 1910, somewhere around there. 
[03:25:30]  Lost a lot of people.  Lost pretty much the entire community a hurricane back in the day.  And I guess that's...  That they decided to make a statue to kind of honor those people that died in that hurricane  almost a century ago.  So, I'm an idiot.  A century ago?  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I'm an idiot.  Cares about them.  I was going to say, and you're apologizing to me.  Oh, at least I don't know why your mic would be on.  I know, right?  Might be mine.  Why would it be?  Let me see if it's my fault today.  Wow.  Okay.  I'll talk.  Okay.  I don't know why you're apologizing to me about the statue, though.  But thanks.  No, not you.  Not you, you dummy. 
[03:26:00]  Let me see.  Hold on.  Let me see how it looks.  I was just checking.  I feel like I should be like the basic instinct chick.  Come on.  Oh, wait.  Why would that mic work, Jimmy?  You're not going to touch it?  You're not going to indicate at all that he can see your pussy?  I got it.  Can you lean back a little bit?  I want to see how it looks.  Like, say he's talking to you.  How would you continually do it?  Like, if he's talking to you...  Just kind of like...  Yeah, just see if you can...  Make sure you open it so you can see the lips, though.  I'm being really a pervert.  And I'm like, hold on.  Just be like, what?  No.  No, she has a nice pussy. 
[03:26:30]  I shaved this morning just for you.  Fucking sexy, man.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, you know panties?  No.  I took them off.  He told me to take them off.  So I said, okay.  Well, if he tells you to take them off, then...  That's what I do.  Isn't she a trooper?  I'm a trooper.  What are you promoting while you're here?  Just before you...  Me.  I don't know.  Oh, she's just hanging.  Can we make panty tea today?  What?  Panty tea.  What is that?  We get a little hot water.  We dip the panties a few times.  The crotch.  You just dip the crotch and the ass of the panties in it.  But my crotch is clean, so I don't know if you'd get anything. 
[03:27:00]  Even a clean one's got to leave a little something.  You like that, Jim?  Her vagina is so nice.  You like that?  Yeah, it's plump and sexy.  Shaved.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Freshly today.  Some people are saying you did tell Dave she's a porn star.  If I did, it's my fault.  We'll figure some out.  Let's bring in David.  Intern David.  We want him to interview her.  I think it's a talk.  Yes.  David?  He's a very naive Jewish virgin.  David!  Is he really?  Do we know that?  David! 
[03:27:30]  Where is he?  David!  Oh, that's right.  We learned that last time.  David!  Where is he?  I'm calling him.  David!  You'll be dead now if it wasn't my David.  David?  That's the best clip.  My, my, my, my David.  David!  David!  Oh, here he is.  Where do I go?  Over there.  Where do I go?  That's all right with you?  A big boy chair.  Look at that.  David, this is one of our fine listeners, Lisa.  Hello.  And we want you to interview her. 
[03:28:00]  Okay.  He's like, all right, I got it, I got it.  We want to see what your, uh...  Your interviewing skills are all about.  Yeah, what kind of chops you have.  Make sure your headphones are working, you little sweet man.  Hello.  Okay.  Fine, why won't you look at her?  What are you, is your headphones not working?  Why don't you turn the volume up?  Yeah.  He's like, I can't hear you.  It's not magic.  There I go.  There I go now.  What are you doing?  You're panicking.  You're falling apart.  Panicky Pete.  How is that?  Hello, hello, hello. 
[03:28:30]  He can't hear himself.  He can't hear your headphones?  No.  No, not really.  Why would they?  Mars is on the, uh...  Okay.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  A little bit, a little.  That's a good thing to do on the radio.  Just hello, hello, test, test, check, one, two.  There I go.  Now I got it.  Ah.  So when you see a volume button, why would you turn the volume a little and go, no, and then I turn it a little more?  I don't know.  Dave, you're having a tough time looking at Lisa.  Why?  I don't know.  Are you angry at her?  I don't know her. 
[03:29:00]  I know, I'm mad.  I don't know who she is.  I never met her.  All right, well, why don't you ask her a few questions and get to know her a little bit.  What are we interviewing?  Because she's a listener and she's up here and it's like we always talk to the listeners  and we never get, we get complaints that we never give the on, like a lot of the staff time to talk to them, so...  Yeah.  That's right, so...  Okay.  Yeah.  Go for it.  Shoot.  I'm all yours.  Okay. 
[03:29:30]  Just get there.  What's your name?  My name's Lisa.  Hi, Lisa.  Where are you from?  I live in Kentucky.  Kentucky.  What are you doing in New York?  I have friends here and I'm visiting.  I listen to the show.  I'm a visitor.  Oh, that's great.  Where in New York are you staying?  Over near Times Square, you know, where all the fun stuff happens.  Oh, do you like Times Square?  I do.  It's fantastic.  What do you like about it?  It's all the pretty lights.  Definitely.  They're very pretty, aren't they?  Absolutely.  Are you a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  Absolutely. 
[03:30:00]  Do you listen every day?  Not every day.  But every morning.  Yeah.  I try.  I gotcha.  I do my best.  It's an interrogation.  I know.  What do you do for a living?  I run websites.  I'm a webmaster.  Oh.  I'm a computer geek.  What kind of websites are these?  All different kinds.  I've made a ton.  And you mean you get contracted by the companies to make websites for them?  Absolutely.  I'm a nerd, I know.  What makes you so experienced in website making? 
[03:30:30]  I've done it for years.  Did you study computer science in school?  No.  Actually, communications, but same difference.  How did you get experience?  Like, when did you make your first website?  Ah, wow.  1999.  Oh, and what was that a website of?  Do you remember your first website?  I do.  It was a picture one.  It had pictures on it.  Was it for a certain company or just on your own?  Just on my own.  Okay.  That's good to know.  How long are you going to be in New York City for?  I leave on Friday. 
[03:31:00]  Friday?  Just a couple days.  Nice little short trip.  Oh, are you upset to go back home?  No, I'm ready to go.  No?  No, because I like my house.  What about New York?  You don't like New York?  No, I love New York.  So then why would you leave?  Because I live somewhere else.  Maybe you should move to New York.  Okay, maybe.  Why not?  I like living in Kentucky.  It's nice and mellow.  Where do you live?  He's like, that's really annoying.  Does that bell signify the end of this interview? 
[03:31:30]  No, no, no.  He's just being silly.  Don't worry about that.  Would you like me to continue with the interview?  Yes, we would.  Would you like to?  You know, I hear tell she might be single there, David.  So maybe ask her a few questions about that.  Yeah.  Sometimes we love her breakups, listeners.  That's good.  Uh, where do you, uh, do you live with anybody?  Do you have a roommate, or?  I don't.  Actually, well, I do, yeah.  He's, he's, he's sort of a roommate.  He?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's all right.  Don't let that catch him down.  He's sort of a roommate. 
[03:32:00]  He's gay, David.  What?  He's gay.  He's a roommate.  He's gay.  Is he really?  Absolutely.  Okay, that's, that's good to know.  Yeah.  I wonder why you didn't have another, like, a straight roommate be, be,  Exactly.  He'd be all, he'd be kicking down my door every day.  Yeah.  I can't have that.  What's your current, uh, status?  Are you single?  Are you, um, involved with a guy?  Married?  I am all over the place.  I'm all of the above.  All of the above?  All of the above.  See, she's a girl that's, uh, you know.  All of the above means you're single, you have a boyfriend, you're married all at the same time? 
[03:32:30]  Exactly.  I have one of everything.  I'm not sure, what does that mean?  Because a lot of times people are married, she's already told us this, and they separate,  and there's the, and the paperwork hasn't gone through, so there's a technical marriage.  Technicalities.  So you're separated, but you're not, you're not officially divorced yet.  Exactly.  Is that too much of a touchy subject for you?  No, absolutely not.  Are you seeing someone right now?  No.  I'm seeing lots of people, but no, not one person in particular.  There you go.  Lots of people. 
[03:33:00]  So how many?  I don't, I have no idea, I can't even count.  There's, I got one in every city.  I have, whoa!  So, I mean, you have a, you have a guy, you know, you have a guy in every, like, if you  were on vacation and once you'd be like, well, you'll look up the guy in that city and you'll,  okay.  That's right.  In Miami?  You always kind of have sugar daddies everywhere you go.  Oh, did I say that out loud?  Do you have a guy, do you have a guy that you go, that you see when you visit New Jersey?  Uh, yes, actually.  He's looking to represent. 
[03:33:30]  But I can take another one.  I'm from Jersey.  Can I, yeah, maybe I can replace this guy.  Who is this guy?  Uh, he's just a friend.  You like Lisa?  You want to replace the guy?  Nice.  You find her attractive, David?  Definitely do, sure.  Yeah?  What do you like about her?  She's good looking.  Uh-huh.  Aw, that's so sweet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, she's good looking.  What else?  I mean, that's, give it some specifics.  Is she your type?  Oh!  What do you like about her?  She has cool tattoos.  Look at that tattoo right there. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, they're, yeah.  I guess they're, I guess they're nice, yeah.  He doesn't like my tattoo.  No, he's not, he's probably, he's a very, he's never, they're the girl with tattoos.  Oh, well, I have lots of them.  Well, I don't know.  I don't want to be too honest.  Should I be honest?  Yes!  Go ahead.  Take a good look and, uh, let us know.  Well, I don't.  Well, you're not looking.  I'm looking, I don't, I'm looking.  I don't know about this tattoo, if I'm going to be honest, tattoos really aren't my thing,  to be honest.  Well, you're Jewish.  Well, there's only a couple, she has them on her, it's nothing big, on each ankle. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, tattoos really aren't my thing.  Do you have tattoos anywhere else, Lisa?  I have one on the back of my neck and one on my lower back.  Oh, can you show them the lower back tattoo?  Is that asking too much?  No, of course not.  If it is, I apologize.  All right.  Okay.  What do you think of that one?  As I said before, as I said before, I'm not really into tattoos.  Well, but you, it was right above her hiney hole.  I noticed that.  That's right, it's perfect placement for people to see. 
[03:35:00]  I noticed that.  Yeah?  Yeah, I noticed.  Do you, uh, so the tattoos, the tattoos are a turn off, so you can't bring her home  to your parents, obviously.  She should just wear, like, a long skirt, right?  Some socks.  What else?  Yeah.  What do you like about her?  You don't like the tattoos.  What do you like about her?  Look around.  I'm looking, I'm looking.  I don't, I don't know.  There's something, there seems to be a problem.  What's, what's going on over there?  Yeah, what's the matter?  I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be too honest about my, my true 
[03:35:30]  feelings and embarrass her or be make fun of her, so I don't want to say.  Why would you make fun of her?  I was going to say, you make fun of me.  She's very sexy.  Yeah.  And what would, what would, yeah, be honest.  You'd have a problem.  I don't want to be honest because if I'm honest, it would be too rude.  What?  What's rude about it?  Holy Jesus.  All right, I'll turn off your mic.  I just don't want to be rude.  It's kind of rude.  If I want to say my true feelings.  Lean over to Anthony.  What's rude?  Lean over to Anthony and tell him because I, I, I, I got your mic off.  Oh, okay.  That's all I hear in the headphones. 
[03:36:00]  I didn't turn it off yet.  Take your headphones off.  All right, your mic is off.  Whisper to Anthony.  Jesus Christ.  What?  He's a flaming homosexual.  Well, what'd you say?  You say it.  I mean, come on.  Just get it out in the open.  It's actually, let me tell you something.  Nothing offends me.  That isn't offensive to her.  No.  That, that, that'd be like a girl whispering to, uh, one of her girlfriends, I don't like 
[03:36:30]  him.  His cock's too big.  You know?  So it's, you might think it's an insult, but she won't.  All right.  We could just be honest and tell her.  And look her in the eye and tell her that.  Yeah.  For once.  Look in that eye.  Look in the eye.  Whale's on.  Again.  Again.  All right.  What are we saying now?  You're telling the truth.  You're just telling her what you told me.  Yeah.  Because it's not an insult.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If I'm going to be honest, if I'm going to be...  I won't be offended.  It's okay.  Because, like, guys have different tastes.  I have different tastes. 
[03:37:00]  And to be honest, your breasts are a little too big for me.  To be honest.  Hey, that's all right.  Your breasts are too big.  Too big.  I'm too big for her.  It's okay.  I'm not saying I don't like breasts.  I'm just saying that they...  I like...  No, no.  I like a little smaller.  Hold on.  Hold on, David.  You're only seeing the top cleavage part.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe if you saw the whole breast...  Well, that...  Why?  Would there something...  No, but...  Like, maybe if you saw the...  What?  A titty monster's going to jump out?  No.  It's not that I don't like...  It's not that...  What do you think about that?  Oh.  I told...  It's not that I don't like it. 
[03:37:30]  It's just...  Can you take them both out?  Yes, I can.  It's not that I don't like it.  Yeah, pump those out.  All right, David.  What's wrong with that?  How about this?  Hey, look.  May I?  Yeah, go ahead.  Now, would you feel one just to see how soft it is?  Just see if it...  You can.  She won't forget.  Yeah, but it's not that I don't want to feel...  Shh.  Wait, wait.  What was he going to say?  What were you going to say?  No, no.  Of course you want to feel, but what?  I just...  Everyone has their own, like, preferences.  Yeah.  Here's her men.  But it's just a tit hanging out.  No, no, they're not.  No, no, no.  Have you ever grabbed a boob before? 
[03:38:00]  Have you ever grabbed a tit?  I have, yes.  Where?  I don't know.  Just have.  Where?  He's like, I just have.  Where?  Walking down the street.  Probably angrily.  Yeah, exactly.  Grab her school.  Now, where have you had contact with a breast?  I don't know.  Just have.  In a club a couple of times?  A club?  Strip clubs?  They don't let you touch them in strip clubs, sir.  That's illegal, David.  Well...  Some girls do.  Just give a little grab.  You give her a...  They're real, too.  I'm not saying they're not real.  I'm not saying that.  Stop insulting her.  I'm not... 
[03:38:30]  Why are you insulting her?  I asked you before if it was insulting.  You said no.  No, it's not.  I asked you before if it was insulting.  You said no, I can say it.  Not touching is insulting.  Yeah, it's insulting.  Touch.  Touch.  In this country.  All right, here's David.  He's moving in for a touch.  And don't worry.  Give it a good one.  Use both hands.  Feel the weight.  Feel the weight of it.  Yeah, use both hands.  Feel the weight.  Yeah, you know.  Use both hands, all right?  Oh, thanks.  Bring your mic over so you can talk.  I'm going to hear what you're saying.  Yeah, let's...  Okay.  I can't really...  That's all right.  We're fine.  Go ahead.  So what am I doing right now?  Feel it.  There's two big bare tits. 
[03:39:00]  What do you think you're doing?  Yeah, I see.  I see.  How big are those, Lisa?  38 double Ds.  38 double Ds.  Very firm.  No implants, right?  Natural.  Natural.  All right, David.  Two hands.  Get in there.  All right.  Here we go.  It's definitely nice to feel, I mean, but...  It's like you were, like, milking a cow.  What at all?  Anyone else notice that?  You've got to touch them a little, like...  You've got to get sexier.  Better than that.  You've got to be a little sexy, a little more caressing. 
[03:39:30]  You're, like, giving her a fucking breast exam.  Yeah, I know.  Well, I don't know what you want me to do.  Well, there's two 38 double Ds.  They're bare.  Yes, I see that.  You have two hands.  Do you see how God thinks?  I see.  Yeah, I see.  David, what would you do?  Just rub it like a big mezuzah.  Yeah, just...  Just do what you would do.  What would you do with those?  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go in there.  You would do that.  He's...  Wow.  He's massaging them.  Yeah, yeah.  The way one checks a ham before one punches it. 
[03:40:00]  He was...  It's like...  That was...  It's definitely nice.  It's nice.  He was waxing a car.  Yeah, you were doing a little Daniel-san.  You were kind of assaulting them.  Like, you were searching those tits.  Yeah.  Seeing if they'd stolen anything.  Why don't you gently rub your fingers over...  No, no, no, you want me to...  Gently rub your fingers over the nipples.  Yeah, grab the nipple.  Just do that.  Nicely.  Just gently...  Give it a pinch.  So your four fingers go like...  Yeah.  Over her nipples.  There you go, David.  Would you be...  Wow.  Would you be okay with that?  I'm absolutely fine with it. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, she's fine.  Apparently.  That's nice that you asked, though.  That's good.  Thank you.  That's very nice of you.  You're very polite.  All right, get in there, David.  Give him a little frut.  Oh, okay.  All right, let's see how he works the nipple.  Go ahead, David.  Make believe we're not here.  I don't know how you want me to do it.  Much better.  Just kind of let your fingers, like, go like...  Let your fingers do the walking.  Like, let him skip over the nipple, like...  Like, pointer, middle, ring, pinky.  Like, vrp, vrp, back and forth like that, just to get, like, a little... 
[03:41:00]  I don't know what you mean, like...  Just try it out.  Jimmy will help you through it.  He looks like David Patterson reading.  Just like that.  Like, you just caress, pinch a little bit, but lightly.  Yeah, let's go, David.  You just kind of, like, feel nicely with your thumb.  Just touch nicely.  Put a knife and cut him off.  All right.  Hey, hey, hey.  Well...  That's good.  Very good, David.  Now...  Is that the appropriate way?  Yeah, but you're just touching them. 
[03:41:30]  It's like, you should actually put your face against one.  You don't have to do anything.  You just put your face against it.  Yeah, the side of your head.  It's nice.  It's like a sleeping...  Yeah, see if she has warm bosoms.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Take your headphones off and...  Yeah, it's fine.  We're here.  Yeah, we're here for you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Don't be embarrassed.  You can't see it.  Fine.  Yeah, they can't see.  Go ahead.  Who can't see?  Go ahead.  Don't do it, man.  So what exactly am I doing?  Well, again, there's...  You got a picture for me, sir.  We got to get...  No. 
[03:42:00]  What are you doing what every guy in the room wants to do?  We got to get someone to play the part of the jealous husband.  Nice.  Take your glasses off.  Yeah?  Yeah.  For a second, because you...  That was a very...  That was very matronly and motherly, the way you did that.  Yeah, it was.  How do you want me to...  I'll show you.  This is not about me.  This is about...  He's always ready to go.  I'll do it.  I'm not going to do it.  You should go like this.  Press your lips.  Just gently against the nipple.  Like that.  You don't have to do anything.  Just...  Yeah, be gentle.  What was I doing before? 
[03:42:30]  What were you doing before?  You look like a ram fighting another ram for the right to mate.  Come on, dear.  Don't be shy.  Aw, look at that.  With his glasses.  How about your nose, your mouth?  What are you not...  I'm doing what you're doing.  No, you're rubbing your head like fucking...  He looks like Rain Man.  When Rain Man would rub his head against something.  Oh, right.  This is what you're doing.  That's what you're doing.  No, I was doing this.  This is the top of your head.  This is the side of my face. 
[03:43:00]  Watch.  I love this part.  See?  You rub your face against the nipple.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Feel free.  He just rubbed his head.  It looks like he's washing his face with a tit.  It looks like they just brought that hot towel in first class.  And he's wiping his face with it.  It happens.  A little bit.  There's nothing...  That's exactly what you were doing.  There's nothing wrong.  He's doing it a little different.  David's doing a fine job.  Yeah, I'm not saying it's bad. 
[03:43:30]  You look shy.  Would you...  No, I'm shy.  I'm only shy because I didn't know that I was going to be doing this.  I had no idea.  He didn't have enough prep time.  What's your religious background?  Who?  Oh, you.  Me?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Christian, I guess.  Yeah?  Okay.  I grew up Baptist.  I don't know.  What about how filthy is this?  A little mixed religious thing there?  You should suck one.  What if...  Jeez.  You should suck one.  Yeah.  You need a rabbi to bless it first.  Are those kosher tits?  You should just suck one.  Probably not. 
[03:44:00]  You probably should.  You should suck one, I think.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  I don't think that's a little too inappropriate.  Well, you know, you just start kissing the nipple a little bit and then if, you know, sucking  is involved, that's fine.  If not, you know, you do what you want.  Kiss the nipple.  It's like, uh, that's like your personal playground right now.  Yeah, kiss the nipple.  I'll show you on the other one.  All right.  Jimmy will show you on the other one.  He'll do it.  Thank God there's two.  Yeah, all right.  You hold it up like this.  Okay.  You look at your friends and you go, eh.  You hear? 
[03:44:30]  Aw.  Aw, you could do that.  That's sweet.  I can give a kiss.  Yeah.  It's like kissing Nana.  I mean, I can do it however I want, but I'm trying to do it the way you were telling me  to do it.  No, whatever you want.  No, no.  You do it your own style.  Why don't you be like De Niro in Cape Fear?  Yeah, yeah.  Cape Fear.  Get in there.  Get in there, Jimmy.  Your own style, sir.  Get in there.  All right.  However you want to do it.  All right.  He's taking the headphones off.  He's going in.  He's going in for, uh, for the kiss. 
[03:45:00]  Wait, can we get a mic on it?  Ooh.  Maybe.  Hold on.  He's licking.  You're licking.  I was impressed.  You don't know.  That's not bad.  The guy was.  You don't have to back out.  Wow.  The guy was licking the nipple.  You don't have to back off so, uh, quickly, sir.  Um, we, um, hold on.  Anthony, can you?  Look at, find out exactly what Anthony wants you to do.  Because I think that was, Anthony, can you tell David?  Oh, I would actually, if you could, uh, grab the, the breast and, uh, do what you were 
[03:45:30]  doing.  A little kissing.  Grab the, like, grab one of the breasts with one.  Yes, yes.  And then just, uh, kiss the nipple a little more and then lick around the nipple a little  if you, if you feel.  That's what I started to do before on my own.  All right, yeah, but you don't have to cut it so short.  You can do whatever, you know, you want.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I would, I don't know if you want me to do a specific one.  Yes, whatever, you know, wing it.  Look.  All right.  Wing it.  Yeah.  Yeah, she likes to have fun.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  She worried.  Can you say?  Okay.  What are we doing?  Roll over there.  He's going to kiss her left breast. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, yeah, very good.  Do what I was doing before.  Just hold it.  Yeah, whatever you're comfortable with.  It's up to you.  You're doing great.  Okay.  Whatever.  She likes it.  I'm here.  Do you like it?  Absolutely.  All right.  Good for me.  Want me to say anything?  Just get in there.  I don't have to say anything.  All right.  Mmm.  Ooh.  Someone is going to play the part of a great husband.  It's getting better. 
[03:46:30]  Wow.  All right.  That's not bad.  Hey.  You're kind of getting into it there.  I like that.  Yeah.  That's, uh...  Yeah, you're kind of getting into it.  Do you want to touch her legs?  She has really beautiful legs.  I like she has nice, feminine, soft legs.  I don't know if you're going to get a chance at this again, man.  Look at those big boobs.  I didn't know I was going to have this chance at all.  That's fantastic, isn't it?  I didn't know I was going to be doing this.  David, I noticed you were looking, like, at her, uh...  Oh, that's why.  Oh, wow.  I saw your panties down there.  I saw you looking at the, uh...  I certainly did notice. 
[03:47:00]  I don't know if I'm supposed to mention that or not, so I didn't say anything.  Oh, well, you noticed, though, right?  I noticed.  Why don't you face him a little bit and, uh...  Yeah, could you open your...  Oh, there we go.  Yeah.  What do you think of that?  What do you think, David?  I forgot that I had a skirt on.  You been that close to one?  That's very nice.  It's nice.  Well, yeah.  Well, most people would yell out, Jesus, but in your case...  Look at that, huh?  What do you think?  That's where...  That's where a cock goes. 
[03:47:30]  Sometimes.  There's a little chuckle.  David, what do you think?  I think it's very nice.  You want to touch it?  I don't know what I'm allowed to do or not allowed to do, so...  Well, ask Lisa.  I'm not gonna...  You can't touch it if you'd like.  I would touch it if I'm allowed.  All right.  Well, sure.  There it is.  Wow, look at that.  I'll even bring it to you.  Look at that.  So what do I...  Okay.  Sam, get out of the way to the camera.  Just touch it?  Thank you.  Yeah, go down there.  Get really close.  Can Sam see? 
[03:48:00]  Hey, could you, like, uh...  Like, use your thighs to close up his ears while he's in there?  Why not?  Just...  You don't have to lick it.  Don't lick it.  Just get close.  No?  No, don't lick it.  Just get close.  Just kiss the thighs.  No licking.  No, no licking the pussy.  Just kiss the thighs.  We don't know where she's been.  What?  I don't.  I don't even know who she...  I don't know anything.  It might be all...  It's fine, though.  You can look at it.  Get close and look at it.  Yeah.  Don't touch it.  Okay.  You can touch it.  No, you can touch it.  You can give it a touch.  Touch it your fingers.  Give it a touch.  We'll be born.  What do you think?  The part of an animal brain. 
[03:48:30]  Can you get in there, Sam?  Kiss the thigh.  Can you see?  Yeah.  And then touch a little and kiss the thigh.  That'll work, right?  It should.  Yeah, touch the vagina again.  That was good the way you were touching it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Touch again.  I swear he's going to become a director one day.  I know.  He's good.  Touch.  Do you want to look at the hiney hole next?  It's up to you guys.  What do you want me to do?  I don't know what you want me to do.  We know. 
[03:49:00]  What do I got to do?  Touch it again.  All right.  So touch again.  Touch the vagina.  There you go.  Touch the pussy.  Touch it.  What is he doing?  I don't know, Jimmy.  I can't see.  I don't know.  Do you know where that special spot is?  Find the special spot.  Here's one hand.  Just run your finger right down that little credit card.  It kind of looks like a swipe.  A credit card swipe thing.  You kind of look like you're checking bad fruit. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Just touch it softly.  We want you to find the sensitive area there.  Yeah.  All righty.  Just touch softly.  All righty.  Okay, he's poking around in there.  Is he finding it, Jimmy?  No.  He's running his hands over.  Along the, but on the outside edges.  Yeah.  So you need to go dead center.  And kind of rub your finger down the middle a little bit.  She's okay with it again.  I'm perfectly fine. 
[03:50:00]  Go ahead.  Put it down the middle a couple of, a couple of few times.  All righty.  All righty.  There you go.  All the way down.  Oh, well.  Lisa, why are you laughing?  I don't know.  No, it's good.  It's the way he's opening.  He looks like he's opening curtains.  Yes, yes.  He's making sure it was opening up.  Well, that's good.  A big variety.  Do you like the vagina?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Definitely.  Could she rub your legs?  I mean, could I feel bad?  Could she rub your leg a little bit? 
[03:50:30]  If she wants to, it's up to her.  I wouldn't mind.  I wouldn't see you rub your leg.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Hey, Lisa, what is he packing?  You can feel through his jeans.  Is he packing anything?  Yeah.  I can feel it through the jeans.  That's always a good sign, right?  That's a good sign.  That's always a good sign.  Once you guys get a little closer, get a little more comfortable.  Why not?  How close do you want me to get?  As close as you want.  As close as you want me to get.  You know.  How close do you want to get?  It's really up to you, whatever she's comfortable.  Do you want me to sit on your lap?  She seems to be a wild girl.  Would you like that? 
[03:51:00]  I would like that, sure.  Okay, how about you sit where she is?  This way the Paltois cameras can see.  Okay.  Let them sit first.  Let Lisa, who is a...  Wow, wait.  And you sit there, young David, the chair of honor.  Chair of honor, right there.  And you can always talk.  Oh, boy, what a hiney.  You can sit right there.  David, this Lisa is a wild one, huh?  She's great.  I am.  Oh, look at that now.  The hiney.  Yeah.  What exactly?  She'll rub your cock a little.  No, what do you want me to do?  You can grab her boobs from behind. 
[03:51:30]  Wow.  Yeah, is there anything specific on me to do or I can just do whatever I want?  Now it's whatever you want, David.  Now he's like, I don't want to...  What can I do?  Yeah, if you want me to do something specific, is my...  David...  Can someone get in here with a microphone, an extra microphone that we'll reach?  David, at this point, you should grab that one, Jimmy, and just...  Oh, good idea, good idea.  All right.  Good idea.  Okay.  Or hip-hop, you got that on?  There's anything specific on me to do or I can just do whatever I want.  How about we do a little freestyle and you're on your own now.  We set you up nice here.  Hey, Lisa, could you face David?  Maybe you can put your breasts in his face and touch his penis?  Why not? 
[03:52:00]  All right.  It's harmless.  It's harmless, David.  It's fun.  It's fun stuff, right?  Unless you can't stop.  Scoot back a little bit.  Scoot back a little bit.  Don't be so selfish.  The bigger chair.  Please.  No, it's a big chair.  It's a big chair.  Yeah.  Roll with it.  What?  Roll and see what happens?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's...  Well, can we do that anytime?  Oh.  Hi, dear.  She's sitting on his lap.  I know.  Do you want to touch her juicy little big...  Yeah, run your hands down her ass.  Yeah, have fun, David.  That's it.  David is...  ...his little ass...  ...aggressively rubbing her boobs.  She's bouncing up and down. 
[03:52:30]  He's rubbing her arms.  That's good.  How about that ass?  He's like a grandmother.  You might want to grab it.  Grab that big ace.  Put your hands around back.  Yeah, there you go.  What do you think, David?  Now push your hips forward and stick your dick in her.  Yeah.  I mean, no.  I mean, just...  Are you kidding?  Can she rub your penis through your jeans?  I was.  Yeah, she wants to.  I was.  All right, yeah.  Keep rubbing.  I was.  All right, so he's grabbing her ass now aggressively.  Cool.  Mm-hmm.  Cool. 
[03:53:00]  And, um...  This is nice.  You like it?  I like it.  It feels better than you probably thought it would.  Yeah.  Right.  David, you want to at least sit in your underwear?  That'd be kind of cool.  Not naked, though.  You can't be naked.  They're going to have you completely naked.  No.  Not naked, but...  But in underwear.  Underwear's okay.  No, no, no.  No, why not?  I don't think so.  Underwear?  I don't think so.  All right, keep...  All right, play with her boobs and...  Are you embarrassed?  Are you clipped?  Of course.  Yes.  Stop it.  Are you embarrassed?  I guess. 
[03:53:30]  To be in your underwear?  Oh.  All right, that's okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Let's not...  Do you feel her, uh...  Her, uh...  Pussy against your, uh...  Cock over there?  Not really.  Oh, the chair's not conducive for that?  Can we get a better chair?  Stupid chair.  I really don't, to be honest.  No?  How about you lean, lean back a little more and push your...  No, no.  She means...  No, I mean, I mean, if you, if you slouch, if you slouch in the chair a bit, you'll get  there, you move down.  Yeah.  Now she...  Holy shit. 
[03:54:00]  Dude, your pocket's sticking up.  Whoops.  No, I'm talking about him.  She just backed into a black microphone and the microphone almost disappeared.  I think you have to adjust yourself, don't you?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Where's your dick?  Down by your pocket?  There's a better chair.  Better chair over there?  All right.  Here, David.  I think David is kind of liking this whole thing.  Yeah, David, get in there.  He can't stand up.  Like a little pup tent.  All right, David.  Now have fun.  This is all you, buddy. 
[03:54:30]  There you go.  You guys go at it.  Go at it.  There we go.  She's riding his lap in the jeans.  He has his arms straight out.  All right, Sam.  Sam can move a little bit.  Thank you.  David, you can touch it.  Your arms are in fists straight out.  Spank her a little bit.  Well, if you're going to spank it, take it a little harder than that, dear.  Spank her.  No.  You can spank her.  Just a little tap.  A little love tap.  You want me to show you how to do it?  Yeah, she'll show you.  See?  She doesn't mind it at all. 
[03:55:00]  She likes it.  Exactly.  Yeah, keep spanking her.  I'll have a red ass.  Yeah.  Might be a bust.  You don't know what I do.  Can we just get back to this?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing to my wife?  Huh?  Huh?  Don't be mean.  No, don't let me do it.  Don't be mean.  Uh-oh.  I just listen on the radio.  I just listen to this while coming to see.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You're not supposed to be here.  Shut up.  I'll do what you want to get home.  Okay.  As for you, why are you touching my wife? 
[03:55:30]  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't even know you were here.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know you were her wife.  Oh, fuck.  Look, it's...  Who hides this prick?  Dude, we just...  Who hides this fuck?  We told him to be respectful.  I stabbed him like a fucking twit.  Dude, we just thought that we didn't know.  We thought you guys were broken up and shit.  No, we're not broken up.  She said that there's a...  No, we're not fucking broken up.  All right.  Hold the guy back.  She knows it as well.  Hold the guy back.  I'm sorry.  We told him to be respectful. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, hold it.  Yeah, he...  He was okay.  Ooh, this ain't good.  He was nice.  Nice.  He didn't stick anything in anywhere.  David.  I'm gonna stick something to him in about three seconds.  How about that?  David, you at least held the guy an apology.  Yeah.  He's not an apology.  He's like an ass-kicking in about three seconds.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Look, there's no need for violence.  Dude, there's no need for violence.  He was just...  David, what's the matter?  He was just... 
[03:56:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Now there's gonna be a problem.  David.  David.  Stop, stop, stop.  David, run.  What do I do?  David, just fucking run out of here.  Run!  Run!  Run, while he's coming to hell back.  Fucking run.  Run, get out of here.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  How do we lock you?  Stop, stop, stop.  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do? 
[03:57:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay, that guy was really good.  He's very good.  They got audio.  They got audio.  They got audio.  They got audio.  Is this really the husband or is it a joke?  Stop the fuck outside, all right?  Wait, what?  Jimmy, stop talking outside.  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Is this really her husband or is it a joke?  Is this a joke like playing that joke on me to try to like...  He's really the husband?  He's really upset?  Come out.  Get the fuck out. 
[03:57:30]  Right the fuck down.  Get the fuck out the room.  Get the fuck.  No, no, stop, stop.  Wait a minute.  This is too much.  Get the fuck out the room.  I can't do this.  Get the fuck out the room.  Get the fuck.  It's my second day of an injury.  Bro.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm not going to hit him.  Get up.  Get the fuck off me.  Get the fuck off me.  It's my second day of an injury.

Look how he's so tired now.  Wait.  He comes by and watches the show all the time.  We finally got involved. 
[03:59:00]  God damn it.  Let's bring David in to apologize.  Just don't give it away.  Wait.  Can we hold him down?  We calmed you down.  Hold him down.  Hold him down.  Like, have him held down in a chair.  He just wants now.  We calmed him down and talk.  All he wants is an apology.  Tell him we calmed him down and talk to him.  He just wants an apology.  Get him in that big chair and make believe you're holding him down.  Who's holding him down?  Me.  Yeah, but don't laugh.  Don't give it away.  Okay.  David, he just wants an apology.  Come on. 
[03:59:30]  I'll try to get him in here to apologize.  But Mars and Steve.  Should we sit on him?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hold him, Mars.  Hold his arm.  Wait.  Yeah.  David.  Yeah.  Bring David in.  Did he and Anthony know he was here?  He was going to attack me like that?  They didn't know.  Listen, he wasn't such a joke.  Wait, Jim.  Did you guys know that he was going to come in and attack that plan?  Listen, it was planned for me to go in there and do stuff with her.  That was planned.  Yeah, we don't know what's going to happen.  The guy comes once in a while, but we didn't know what the relationship was. 
[04:00:00]  We don't know.  But did you know he was going to come and attack me like that?  No, dude.  How are we supposed to know that?  No, no, no.  He didn't attack you.  He was just yelling.  You could have.  Wait, we held him back.  That's fine.  Why did you?  You guys told me to go up to like...  Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to do all that.  You know, we would like just touch her respectfully.  We didn't realize you were going to put your fingers in there.  Hey, shithead, get in here.  He just wants you to apologize.  He feels like...  Wait, but it wasn't my toy.  You...  He came in, you were sucking her tits.  Face me like a man to get your ass in here.  It's a guy's wife.  It's a guy's wife.  What do you know?  But did you know he was going to be there in attack?  Come on!  No, I wouldn't have touched her if I knew that. 
[04:00:30]  But just don't say I didn't.  Just apologize.  Apologize.  Always be your margain.  You disrespected the guy.  Holy shit.  David, first of all, we owe you an apology.  We didn't know the guy.  I had no fucking idea.  We told him, though.  We did tell David to kind of just be respectful and stuff like that.  I don't mean to.  She comes by the show a lot.  She's a slut.  And I didn't...  You got a little carried away.  First of all, I don't want to offend anybody.  I understand. 
[04:01:00]  We're holding him down, as you can see.  I don't want to offend the husband.  I don't even offend you two.  Yeah, but the thing is, we were just telling you to touch her.  But you got a little carried away.  You were sucking her tits.  You put her on your lap.  We didn't tell you to do any of that stuff.  I didn't know this was going to even happen.  No, but you're looking between her legs.  You're kind of making her uncomfortable.  He needs to know what you actually did to her.  And then you got to apologize for it.  Just tell the truth.  That's what he told us he wants.  Just tell the truth.  For whatever reason.  Sorry for what?  What did you do to her?  He's held down nice. 
[04:01:30]  Look.  He's all right.  Just talk to him.  He's exhausted.  So what do I...  Just tell the truth about what you did.  What'd you do?  You make us all look like fucking creeps.  That's all he wants is an apology for...  But he needs to know what you did to his wife.  Because it didn't go all that far.  No, it didn't go all that far.  Not at all.  Because he's thinking it was a lot worse.  So explain what you did.  No, no.  It wasn't a lot worse.  What did you do to Lisa and apologize for it?  Okay, well...  Well, I came into the...  Look me in the eye and tell me what the fuck you did.  I came into the studio and I met her and I was asking her some questions. 
[04:02:00]  And then what happened?  Then I looked at her and I touched her breasts a little.  And then I kissed them a little.  Then I touched her legs and thigh area a little bit.  And then she...  Tell him everything, Dave.  And then she got on top of me.  Wait, wait.  Jimmy needs something out there.  He knows it.  Just tell him everything.  Because everything is videotaped.  So he's going to see the videotape anyway.  What?  There's more that you're not telling me?  And then after that she got on top of me and started moving up and down.  And I started touching her and caressing her. 
[04:02:30]  Touching her where?  On her breasts.  On her ass.  Up and down her back.  I touched her on her vagina a little bit.  You did what?  A little.  What?  You should have left that part out, probably.  You should have said everything.  Yeah, but, you know, by that we would...  Oh, boy.  You know, stuff you can get away with at a strip club.  No, no, no.  Please, get up.  Please.  I want to throw you...  Tell her what she did to me.  Yeah, you better tell her. 
[04:03:00]  What possessed you to do that?  What possessed me?  What the...  Why would you do that?  I don't really know what to say.  I don't know what to...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why would you do that?  I don't know what to say.  What am I supposed to say?  Why I did that?  I don't know.  How about to say that I apologize and I'll take my ass kicked like a man?  How about that?  Say that.  Okay, it's not cool you guys are holding the guy down.  Let him go.  I don't think you've lost anything.  Whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  Stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop.  Whyします?

[04:05:30]  guy he's not gonna freak out he's relaxing now but so he's really into the husband he's really  upset yeah yeah but he thinks that you don't like the whole black white marriage thing because  that's not true i just wouldn't when did i say that i didn't say that let's go let's go in the  you're screaming in the hallway let's go into uh excuse me i didn't i didn't say anything about  that yeah i never said that why does he think that i don't even  how do how do i know that he's really how do i know that he's really the how do i know that he's 
[04:06:00]  really the husband i don't know who he is um i guess so i mean i don't know the guy i just know that he  came in and he was a little freaked out um i mean we got we got to make it interesting for the radio  we have to because it's happening we can't not make it interesting but he thinks it's not a joke  he's really yes the husband i mean he's they're okay he'll be okay he's relaxing now are you playing  like a practical joke on me as being a new intern or is he really just came out and you didn't know  he was gonna come no idea he was gonna come we don't know what that relationship is he's been  here before but we didn't know you know we don't ask you promise he's he's really the husband he's 
[04:06:30]  really upset yes okay he thinks that the whole interracial thing is bothering you but i didn't  and that you're basically oh is that okay  because basically he thinks that uh the whole black and white issue is like you feel like it's  a black man with a white woman and you don't like that so you can pretty much do what you want to do  what gives him the right to think that i didn't say anything about gives him the right he thinks that  because like he thinks like yeah you know she was dating a match to a black guy and you're just 
[04:07:00]  gonna grab her big white titties and not care what he thought well i didn't when i was grabbing  her because i didn't know that her husband was black how did i know i didn't know that yeah but  he thinks that you did know it and that's why you didn't tell me that her husband was black yeah but  i told him i did because he was mad at me but i didn't know well tell him that don't tell me that  tell him that just tell him that because he thinks i'm not gonna go near him he's gonna like punch me  no no no we'll protect you what what's happening he didn't have me unconscious this guy i don't know  well uh we'll look out for you but just make sure that uh just apologize to him

[04:08:00]  well i was saying basically we didn't hear we took a break what happened oh basically i was telling  david the the issue of race and how you know that the husband feels that you know what he was saying  about how and like about david grabbing her big white tits because he didn't like the fact that  she was with a black guy and he hates that kind of and um you know now he's claiming he didn't know  her husband was black whatever i mean david what is that true that is true the honest truth is that 
[04:08:30]  i didn't know that her husband her husband was black and even if and even that you are black that doesn't  mean anything to me i'm not i don't i'm not racist i don't i'm not i don't care about that that's  that's fine with me i don't have a problem with racism with race like that you don't have a  problem with racism yeah you basically say if she wants to ruin her life you don't care no i don't  have a problem with with with her marrying a black man i didn't even know that you dead her husband  was black no one told me that but you probably knew she had a husband and you didn't care and even that  you are black it doesn't matter anything to me and i'm not trying to be offensive to you at all 
[04:09:00]  and if i was by any means i sincerely apologize to you i am sorry and you don't say the n-word right  never never yeah maybe have you ever have you ever said we all have said it i've never said that  that's that's the problem there's a dishonesty here yeah we all say it but we're not proud that  we do and we know make sure there's so you're the windows are rolled up usually so you're like  everybody admits to it you probably said it at one point in your life maybe as a kid it's a stupid  thing to do i understand that anyone would understand that i wouldn't say i wouldn't say it to anyone's
