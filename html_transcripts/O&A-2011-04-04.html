<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, hosted by Opie and Jim Norton (with Anthony Cumia absent), began with Norton detailing his illness – insomnia and malaise possibly stemming from travel – following successful stand-up gigs in Irvine.  They contrasted the positive show experience with the negative experience of navigating Los Angeles traffic.  A substantial portion focused on Norton’s struggles with sex addiction and sobriety, examining the fleeting gratification and subsequent dissatisfaction of casual sex and pornography.  They discussed remedies for Norton's illness, including neti pots, and Norton recounted humorous anecdotes: a flight attendant’s overreaction to turbulence, and hallucinating celebrities while on cold medicine.  The conversation also touched upon Sting's perceived rudeness, dealing with fans, experiences with pain medication (including Vicodin and a story about impulsively discarding it), and a colleague's experience undergoing surgery without painkillers.

Jay Moore and Billy Hayes joined the broadcast. Norton recounted his "Hereafter" filming experience, detailing interactions with Clint Eastwood, including Eastwood's use of racial slurs and an odd offer of Czechoslovakian beer.  Further discussions of Alcatraz and the work-life balance followed.

The show then transitioned into a discussion centered around a bizarre Alcatraz escape story and a listener-driven "top five" Rolling Stones songs list.  This segment was peppered with tangents, including a story about Billy showering in an Angels clubhouse after a body odor accusation.  A heated argument with a caller, Victor, ensued, involving insults and criticisms of the hosts' comedic styles, leading to further top five lists (comedians), and more insults directed at Victor.  The Rolling Stones discussion resumed intermittently, interspersed with playful competitive list ranking. A listener's own top five Rolling Stones list was presented, and the ordeal was lightheartedly concluded.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming discussions on Charlie Sheen's stand-up performances. Greg Hughes was present in studio for this segment, along with Norton and Hayes.


The next segment focused heavily on various "top five" lists: Rolling Stones songs (with debate over "Ruby Tuesday"), hardest things to say, best comedians (mentioning a "Virus Tour"), and worst baby names.  Charlie Sheen's failing comedy tour was discussed at length, detailing poor performances, walkouts, and boos, along with his criticisms of Alcoholics Anonymous and the success rates of such programs.  The difficulties of working with certain venues and promoters were also discussed.  A call from River Rat/David contributed to the comedian list discussion.  Frequent use of vulgar and offensive language was present throughout this segment.  The hosts mentioned upcoming shows with Jay Moore and comedian Otto, described as having an extreme and unexpectedly funny comedic style.  The segment ended with a discussion of plane crash fatalities and an anecdote about Otto's dark humor.

The following segment opened with discussions of comedians, specifically Otto and his puppet, George, noting their shocking and unpredictable audience interactions.  An anecdote detailing a night with Otto and two women, highlighted by his crude humor and obliviousness to their emotional states, was shared.  The conversation shifted to Opie's relationship with his priest, Father Tim,  covering their unusual friendship and irreverent discussions about celibacy, sexual urges, and religious faith, laced with crude jokes and sexually suggestive comments.  A caller, Larry, defended the priest's faith.  The conversation then jumped to Al Pacino (with an anecdote about Opie mistaking a stranger for him), followed by stories about Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, particularly their *Raging Bull* interactions.  Finally, a caller, Rich, attempted to discuss Snooki's WrestleMania appearance, leading to further off-topic discussions and jokes.

The final segment centered on Snooki's $37,000 Rutgers speaking fee, contrasting it with Aziz Ansari and Kevin Hart's higher fees.  The hosts expressed disbelief and annoyance at Snooki's fame and earnings.  The conversation was riddled with tangents: a caller's crude and sexually suggestive comments; a discussion of *Caligula* with graphic scene descriptions; the hosts' and callers' top five Beatles songs; a debate about Paul McCartney's dominance over John Lennon (supported by a rehearsal video description); several callers, including a profane Tracy Morgan impression; and extended discussions of the hosts' and callers' sexual experiences and bodily functions, including graphic descriptions of ejaculation.  The hosts frequently insulted and mocked each other and the callers, employing highly offensive language. Jay Morris's sexually charged comments were prominent. One caller shared a (possibly false) story about Joe Pesci being assaulted in Las Vegas. The segment concluded with promotional announcements and a rambling discussion about the Beatles.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I am amazed that it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio. 
[00:04:00]  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Let's do this.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  I don't think they were enjoying Charlie Sheen's show in Detroit.  Yeah, I heard it was rough going for Charles.  It was very rough.  We're going to get into that in a second.  But first of all, I noticed that Jimmy might be a little under the weather.  Yeah, I'm very sick today.  I felt it come on yesterday before I left from California.  Yeah.  And my eye is red, so I thought I had a pink eye.  Yeah.  And I'm coughing, and I'm just fucking, I'm an insomniac. 
[00:05:00]  I'm really miserable.  You've got sleepy eyes, too.  I feel, I woke, I went to bed at 9 o'clock last night.  I went out to dinner.  Yeah.  Went to bed at 9 o'clock.  I'm like, I'm going to get a good night's sleep.  At 3.30 in the morning, I wake up, and I can't go back.  It's all the traveling you're doing.  It finally caught up to you.  I'm worried, though, because I'm like, I never used to get sick, and now I'm getting  sick every time I'm on a plane.  So I'm like, is it the air blowing right in my face?  Right.  And then Brock said he got sick because he had fucking diverticulitis, and then his immune  system kept failing, so I'm like, is that what it is?  Like, is there something bigger happening?  I think you're traveling more.  I think you're beating your body up more.  Maybe. 
[00:05:30]  And then it knocks your immune system down, and you get sicker easier.  Easier.  I feel high right now.  I feel high.  Are you really?  Yeah, just loopy.  Well, that'll make for a good show.  Yeah, I hope so.  Yeah, absolutely.  The shows were good?  They were great.  Yeah.  Irvine was fantastic.  It was like, I thought it was going to be a nightmare.  I'm like, I got no press out there at all.  I couldn't get it, because Carolla was off.  He was going to have me, but he got a gig, so he couldn't do it.  Right.  And there was no local radio that would take me.  I did like one, two interviews for papers.  It was great.  And it was Irvine, California?  Irvine, California. 
[00:06:00]  Where's that?  An hour from L.A.  Hour south, right?  45 minutes with no traffic, probably three hours worth of traffic.  Damn.  And Kenny told me on the way in, the shows were great.  Fantastic.  Right on.  Yeah, they're good fans, man.  A lot of people are wondering why we're doing the show without Anthony.  They think there's some kind of conspiracy thing happening.  Yes.  He's on a two-week vacation, and I have nowhere to go because I have a kid, so I'm like, I'll  come in and do a few shows.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  So Jimmy and I will do the show, and I think Jay Moore's coming in today, and we'll just 
[00:06:30]  make it up as we go along.  Yeah.  I'm not burning days.  Right.  Fuck that.  I would just be sitting home staring at my kid for two weeks.  I don't mind staying home sometimes.  I don't mind just doing nothing.  Yeah, but you get out there, and you're traveling, and seeing a lot of shit.  I haven't seen nothing in a year.  I need to see something.  Yeah, I do get to go on the road.  I don't see much when I'm gone except in San Francisco.  We went out to San Quentin and to the Mythbusters.  Yeah.  But I kind of wish I did more.  Brewer does that.  Yeah.  Jim goes away, and he goes and sees everything.  Yeah.  Brewer, when he's on the road, he likes to take in the city or the town or whatever. 
[00:07:00]  And Bill Burr is good at that, too.  He schedules his whole comedy trips around sporting events.  He does, right?  Yeah, he does.  He's pretty much seen every baseball park in America.  Like, he's seen it all.  That's smart.  Yeah.  And you just stay in your hotel room, right?  A lot of times I do.  Yeah, man.  I just, I don't do much.  I don't do much.  When I'm actively in the sex addiction, it's a lot of, like, porn and stuff, and that's  just all-consuming.  You do nothing. 
[00:07:30]  Just fucking jerk off in five minutes and go see the sights.  I know.  Jump on a trolley somewhere.  I thought to myself, like, am I going to stay in the room in San Francisco and look  at porn when I got an invite to go to a prison with Kenny?  Like, what am I, stupid?  Yeah, that's, uh, I don't know how you deal with that.  Yeah, it's brutal, man.  I was about to give you some advice.  I mean, how am I going to give you advice on that?  No, because I know what I got to do, and I'm just, it's so...  Do you get mad then, do you get mad when you, uh, well, you just got to say it, when you 
[00:08:00]  cum?  Yeah, I mean...  Because you want it to last longer?  Sure, because then you have, then you're like, okay, now it's over.  Now the high, the chase, it's all about that chase.  It's like when you bang a girl.  Right.  It's like, all right, and then you bang her, it's like, who cares?  Right.  Get out.  You want her to just leave.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, what's worse?  What's worse than when she's trying the same affection on you after you cum that worked on you before  you came?  And you get so annoyed.  Oh, you're like, stop touching me.  Can you just leave?  Just go.  They don't understand.  But that's what it's like with porn, too, with jerking off. 
[00:08:30]  That's what I always wonder.  Why don't the girls understand like the guys understand?  It would be a much easier world out there.  Some girls, I guess, understand, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I think most times women are buying, like, they know we're selling them a line of shit.  We're hitting on them.  And I think that they know that intuitively, but they want to believe that it's real.  That it's more than what it's going to be.  Yeah.  They're like, he's not using me.  He just likes me.  And we're having fun.  And we're holding hands and kissing.  And then after you blow a load and just the eye contact stops and you're like, uh, you  know, I got to call my manager.  Then they're like, oh, it was that. 
[00:09:00]  If you confirm it for them.  But then even at that point, they don't get the hint.  And they stay for another six to eight hours.  There's nothing.  Dude, what's worse than when you bring somebody in to stay for a day or two?  This is what I don't miss.  And, and you, you bang them too fast and then you're calm and you're like, I still have  all day today or all day tomorrow.  Then I'll go home till Sunday.  What the fuck did I do?  Why am I here?  It's like getting a tattoo.  Right.  As soon as you finish.  As soon as you finish.  Like, why did I do that?  Tissue? 
[00:09:30]  Mars?  So.  Tissue, I don't have tissues.  All right, maybe we'll get some.  Um, yeah.  So that's, that's.  I got these hard napkins.  No, no, no.  I just got them.  You can, you can.  I neti potted twice, which usually will clear out congestion, but it didn't work this time.  I think neti pots are for girls though.  They probably are.  My girl likes to neti pot.  Yeah, mine does too.  I'm not neti potting anytime soon.  You know what?  What do you do?  Pour warm water in one nostril and it comes out the other?  Yeah.  It's like, uh, they give you like a little saline mix like salt, but it doesn't burn your nose 
[00:10:00]  at all.  And it's like a little kettle and you put it in one nostril, you tilt your head to the left  or to the right, and then you just turn and you really feel silly and it tickles  your nose is coming out and you just look at yourself in the mirror.  Like, well, how did it come to this?  Well, is anything coming out?  Oh, the water you're dumping.  No, I know the water comes out, but anything else?  Well, what do you try to do?  Just soothe the area?  Snot leaks out.  And then when you're done, like you'll, you'll dump for maybe a quarter of the pot and then  you put it down and then you blow your nose.  Right.  It's like fucking, it's an abomination what comes out. 
[00:10:30]  Why don't you just do the Vicks?  Because it doesn't get stuff out.  In a nice warm shower.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it'll get some shit going.  Saline works when you take, I used to have this thing where I would squeeze, it was a  squeeze bottle and you just squeeze it up your nose.  Right.  It was like fire hose.  Right, right, right.  And that would clear me out too.  People are saying you need the Airborne.  Nah, Airborne doesn't work that good.  I've done it.  I've done every, all that stuff.  I have Emergency, which is better.  And I have, I hate the way milk makes my mouth taste.  I just ate some Ope cereal because I'm starving and the cereal is phenomenal.  I just get this weird taste from milk. 
[00:11:00]  What the fuck's wrong with me?  I can't have some milk.  Maybe you're lactose intolerant.  I don't know.  You need the lactose pills.  Maybe I do.  Lactate.  I like lactate milk.  Do you?  I do.  I always drink lactate.  There's no dairy in it at all.  I don't know what it is.  Or there's no lactose.  It's probably just soy.  No.  A lot of those milks are soy.  I stop with soy because I couldn't drink soy.  In fucking coffee.  It was just horrendous.  You look miserable. 
[00:11:30]  I feel okay though.  I mean, I just feel physically, I'm mad that I couldn't sleep two more hours.  Because that would have been a nice eight and a half hour night.  Right.  It's like I try to do the right thing and fuck, I canceled my spot last night.  I'm like, I'm going to go to bed and fucking be Ralph responsible.  And get ready for the show.  Have some sushi.  Be a true gentleman.  Get up in the morning.  Be here a nice quarter of.  And fucking 3.30.  I'm just like, you piece of shit.  I'm so mad at myself.  Why were you mad at yourself?  Because my body is constantly betraying me.  I constantly feel like, I had the shivers. 
[00:12:00]  I feel better now, but I had the shivers.  But that's not betraying you.  That's just getting sick, which happens to everybody.  But the sleep part was betraying me.  It was like, why can I, like the night before, I flew home yesterday with Kenny.  I didn't sleep.  I'm laying there.  I'm tossing.  I'm turning.  I'm like, why am I such an insomniac?  But I heard you had the nice sleeper seat.  Oh, the plane seat was fantastic.  The Continental has a new first where they have these amazing sleeper seats.  Yeah, I did have that.  You were pretty much in a bed.  Yeah, it's like a bed.  It's the new.  Did you sleep on the plane?  A little bit. 
[00:12:30]  More than I normally would have.  When I'm on one of those planes, I do.  Right.  But they said that there was really bad turbulence.  Like they had to sit down while we were taking off.  They couldn't even serve food.  And then they, I hated this one fucking flight attendant because this guy liked that there  was some stuff happening.  And he knew he liked it.  He's like, um, the captain is saying that about two and a half hours in, we're going  to, we're going to encourage some very, uh, some moderate to severe turbulence.  Damn.  So they kept shutting it down.  Everybody would sit down and it was bad and then it would get good and he would almost 
[00:13:00]  seem disappointed and literally it would be fine for a little while.  And then we'd have one bump and he'd go, okay, I guess that's the turbulence that  we were waiting for.  And he would make everybody sit again.  And he was just a fucking, he was like an attention whore.  He wanted to be in charge.  He wanted to be in charge.  Because I guess his job is pretty mundane.  Yes.  And he wanted, he wanted there to be some shit happening that he was taking care of.  That he would have to be the man.  Yeah.  Oh.  Was he like.  I don't know if he was a little fruity, let's say.  I'll say this.  He never played linebacker for Dallas or Pittsburgh, but.  Somewhere in between.  Yeah.  He didn't seem like typically stereotypically, you know, like effeminate. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  But, uh, coming in, it was very bad.  Like when we were coming to Newark, it was horrendous turbulence.  Not as bad as it could have been, but I was like, I'm going to get sick.  Were you bouncing off to the seat?  No, no, no, not that bad.  No, it could have been much worse.  But I just, I felt myself rocking and I started to think about it.  And when I think about it, I'm like, you're going to puke.  Right.  So I took Tums.  Right.  I just couldn't sleep, dude.  It was fucking horrible.  And the guy next to me, I thought was fucking, he looked like Stuart Copeland from the police,  but older.  He had a.  Well, Stuart Copeland would be older now. 
[00:14:00]  No, but I thought it might be him for a second.  We had Stuart on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't him.  This guy was older than Stuart.  And he had like a blonde wig.  He looked like Andy Dick.  I thought it might be Andy Dick for a half second too.  And I sat down.  I'm like, he's way too old.  Were you on cold medicine or something?  Yes, I was.  I thought you were fucking having hallucinations.  I was having celebrity hallucinations.  Yeah.  I thought the pilot was a, I couldn't even think of an actor to improv.  I suck.  I hear Sting's a dick.  There's another story in the paper today that Sting's a dick.  No surprise there.  He was at the.  You remember when we met him? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, he was a little.  It was me and you at the show.  Yes, the two of us.  And I think our chicks were with us.  Yes, chicks were there.  And Sting just got very annoyed that he had to take 10 pictures with some XM employees.  Remember how nice it was?  It wasn't even open up to the, it wasn't even open to the public.  It was just us that he needed to take pictures with.  And I'll say it every fucking time.  You know, I grew up a huge police fan.  And when my flash didn't go off, fuck yeah, I'm asking for a second picture.  Of course you should.  And he got so fucking pissed off that he had to take a second picture. 
[00:15:00]  So I never, like if I'm with fans taking pictures, half the time watching a woman try  to work their camera phone, it's a fucking, it's an, they can never do it.  Right, right.  And I'm always, I try to relax them when they're panicking.  They're like, oh, sorry, she doesn't know what she's doing.  Right.  And I'm like, just relax, dude.  We'll get the picture.  Yeah, yeah.  Relax.  There's no need to freak out.  No need to go crazy.  We're going to get the shot.  Sure.  And it just makes everybody more relaxed.  Hi, buddy.  Jim Wall.  There's no need to.  Where do you want to sit?  Any seats open? 
[00:15:30]  Whatever you want, buddy.  Just don't shake my hand because I'm sick.  People don't get sick, Jimmy.  He let his hand on me.  Yeah, Jimmy's sick.  I feel strange sitting in the chair of the man.  You don't have to sit there.  You can sit wherever you want.  I can never sit in Ann's chair because I have to look at him across.  I have to look at him across.  What's this?  How was her body?  It was great, buddy.  It was really good.  Really good.  We'll see.  That's a great room.  It was my first time.  Is it Jay's mic on?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was my first time.  You need to move your seat up, Jay. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  You look like you're a little kid.  Your neck's better.  My neck's better.  Jimmy wasn't here on...  I had like a broken neck.  Ever just wake up with a bad neck?  Yes, I have.  Shelley, you ever have one of those days?  Yeah.  Please, I'll tell you.  Jay's whole head was to the side of his body.  It was really bad.  It had to be an easy fix, I'm thinking.  I feel like it, oh.  You feel...  Holy shit. 
[00:16:30]  Well, this isn't going to be good for it at all.  Do you want to sit next to me?  You can sit over there.  I don't want to get you sick.  You won't.  I'll move over a little bit.  So, I don't want to interrupt what you guys are talking about.  No, Jimmy flew in from Irvine.  He got up at 3.30.  He did the neti pot.  He's under the weather.  Yeah, I went to bed nice and early.  That's about it.  And I neti pot.  And he was hallucinating on the...  Having hallucinations on the plane.  Why?  She was thinking I was sitting next to famous people.  I was on cold medicine.  I do that all the time.  Yeah.  You're on what?  I was on a little cold...  Not cold medicine like...  It was a colonop and I was like, Jimmy... 
[00:17:00]  I didn't watch that.  And not even alcohol.  I took...  What was it, like DayQuil or something?  No, but I took the nighttime one.  I took the...  There was NyQuil pills.  I didn't take those.  And I took the Alka-Seltzer nighttime cold.  Because there's no alcohol or anything in that.  Right.  But it doesn't work as well as the...  I think NyQuil fucking pills probably work good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't do it.  I'm scared there's alcohol in them.  I didn't touch it.  I had a relapse on NyQuil.  But not the pills, though.  The pills have no alcohol in it, I don't think.  No.  If it's green, it's going.  Maybe.  Okay.  If it's green, you're good to go, bro. 
[00:17:30]  If it's green, yeah.  That's a good...  And even DayQuil.  To me, it's like DayQuil is like non-alcoholic beer.  Right.  He's right, though.  I mean, that green NyQuil will get you fucking going.  Yeah.  That's better than drinking wine and beer and crap.  Jimmy's way more on top of it than I am, I'm sure.  I'm just...  I'm scared, man.  Like, I heard some guys won't take...  Like, I take pain medication if I'm hurt.  Like, when I had to have my sinus operated on, I took Vicodin.  But I take less than the...  And that didn't give you the itch at all?  No, because my motives... 
[00:18:00]  God bless you.  I always know my motives were because it was going to be agony without it.  Like, I had major face surgery.  Like, I had to do it.  But I wean myself off where if they say these pills are for a week, I'll take half the dosage.  By day three, I'm already weaning myself.  I'm only taking half a pill.  I'm taking it every seven hours instead of every four hours.  And I'll throw out when I don't feel any pain.  I throw out.  Well, that's...  Logically, you did it right.  But other people, they take the one.  I know.  And they're done.  I know.  Do you have somebody that gives it to you?  No.  Because I'll give it to my wife.  Right.  And she'll give it to me.  But I'll still figure out a fucking way to sneak it out of the first. 
[00:18:30]  I was going to say, within two days, you're yelling at her.  I said it Friday.  I said sobriety is a lot easier if you put all your years in a row.  Yeah.  If you break that shit up in three different trips, it sucks.  How long are you sobriety?  A while?  Now, four years.  Oh, okay.  Because I went out.  My dentist gave me...  We were talking to Ronnie B.  I ran outside the studio.  I wish this was on the air.  He went through Civil War fucking combat surgery with no...  You know, he had his goddamn appendix out.  You know this.  Yeah.  Was it his appendix?  Yeah.  I think so. 
[00:19:00]  And he had no painkillers.  Fucking white knuckled the entire thing.  He white knuckled the entire time.  And they're like, do you want to get morphine?  And he's like, no, no, no.  And his chick was like, you know, I'll give it to you.  I'll be in charge.  And he goes, okay.  And he said, the moment he said okay, he said it right out here, right?  The moment he said okay, he goes, I'm going to get my iPod.  I'm putting on Velvet Underground.  Like, he had his fucking getting high songs already mapped out.  Wow.  And I have nothing like as cool as getting my fucking appendix ripped out with no painkillers. 
[00:19:30]  With no painkillers.  He had anesthesia when he was getting the surgery.  And after that, he just fucking laid in a bed for two weeks.  I like how he said that.  He white knuckled it.  Wow.  Did you hear Ronnie B talk about that?  I did not, no.  Do yourself a favor.  Get a copy of that show.  It's amazing.  Amazing.  Because he's been sober a really long time.  Yeah, yeah.  Ron doesn't play games.  And he was ready to go right the fuck back in.  I don't think he goes to the rooms, though.  I think he just said...  Is he just a sober guy?  I think he just...  I don't know.  I don't know the deal.  I think he just said fuck it.  He might do a set with us today. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, okay.  So we could ask him that.  I got 10 Vicodin from my dentist the last time I went out, four and a half years ago.  And he gave me 10 Vicodin after a root canal.  And then I took one, it kicked in, and I went downstairs to my private bathroom.  And on a black countertop, I emptied the rest out, and I counted to make sure he didn't fuck me.  Eight, nine.  Better be fucking...  And I'm actually going, he better fucking be nine, cocksucker.  I'll fucking turn right around. 
[00:20:30]  I'll drive there right now and say, where the fuck you're missing two...  You little short motherfucker, what's up?  Like, I was a fucking crazy person.  That is the thinking, too.  It really...  Oh, what a fucking junkie.  You don't realize how nuts it is until you're saying it out loud to another person?  When you're thinking it, it's logical, though.  Why would I want to get fucked for 10 pills?  And I'm not drinking.  The fuck?  You gave it to me.  I need it for pain.  What was the surgery again?  I wasn't even...  It was just root canal.  And then I went to...  Why are they casually just giving you a Vicodin for...  Because they want you to come back.  Yeah, but...  It's the best...  You know, why do they give gas? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Because it's fantastic.  Did you tell them that you might have had an issue in the...  No, I've learned don't ever...  Don't say shit.  I've learned don't ever say that, because you'll be in a hospital going,  no, seriously, I would like some Tylenol.  Right.  Right, right.  Don't ever tell them that.  Don't ever tell them.  Don't ever say, like, by the way...  What happened after the 10?  About six months later, my wife said, you obviously don't like me anymore.  And I went, what?  What are you talking about?  She said, well, just the way you behave.  I just turned into a real, very quick, like, shitty asshole. 
[00:21:30]  So you...  Very flat, like, flash anger.  Were you back in?  I was fucked up.  Wow.  But not even a lot.  Like, you would think somebody would take, like, six or, like, eight a day.  Like, that's what usually, like, a good Vicodin guy would take.  One and a half a day.  Oh, sissy.  Doesn't it make you not shit, too?  Vicodin always scared me, because they said you can't shit when you take Vicodin.  I have a real, like, I think I have, like, a massive sucking chest wound for an anus  when it comes to shitting. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, really?  It's non-stop.  I'm going to shit my pants.  I'm going to shit my pants Friday.  I was just sitting where you were, looking at Opie, and all of a sudden,  and my face went white.  And I was like, I go, where's the bathroom?  They go, it's all the way...  That's not what you want to hear.  All?  When it starts with all...  And I'm like, what?  But it's literally like, I was about to shit my pants.  And I had this...  You know, you can't get up yet, because if I get up,  it's just going to spray shit all over the inside of my pants.  It was the strangest thing.  He had the worst neck injury, and then that caused him to shit. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, it caused him to...  In the middle of a good conversation, too.  Sorry.  I'm like, where the fuck are you going, man?  The other thing was Kyle Turley, the football player.  I don't know.  Tackle.  He used to be on the Saints.  I don't know.  He was on the Rams.  He's the guy that threw the Jets helmet into the stands.  Oh, yeah.  He ripped the helmet off of...  Right.  ...the safety of the Jets, because he ripped the quarterback's helmet off.  Anyway, he...  I went to his house for Viking, and I'm like, he'll have Viking,  and he's a fucking offensive lineman in the NFL.  And he gave me a GNC, like, extra-large, like, creatine whey protein bottle jug, 
[00:23:00]  and it was filled.  It was like, guess how many jelly beans are in the fucking jar-sized thing?  No.  There's no fucking way.  And he goes, if I ever hear you asking anyone for Viking in again,  I'm going to kick the fucking shit out of you.  Because as he handed me this giant...  Wow.  ...jug, like, this should last you the rest of your life.  Holy shit.  If I ever hear that you're asking anyone, I'm killing you.  Where's that GNC bottle now? 
[00:23:30]  This is actually...  This was a good point in my relationship with my wife,  is when I realized you can't fucking hide anything from somebody like this.  Like, somebody that's really, completely intermatched with you.  They know.  They just clean the house and just look at your Viking  and set it back on the shelf and realize you're a dick.  And she just left...  My wife caught me jerking off when we were dating, like, two weeks, three weeks, maybe.  And we were at a hotel in Santa Monica, and we'd already had sex.  And then...  Does this sound familiar?  We had sex. 
[00:24:00]  She goes to sleep.  I go in the other room to jerk off to porno.  Absolutely.  Like, she's fucking laying there.  That's a guy thing.  Yeah.  Makes total sense.  She caught me, and I didn't know it.  And about another...  How'd she catch you?  She got up to pee and looked at me jerking off on the couch.  She went, oh, maybe I'll just let him finish.  She obviously has some work to do.  So I have no idea that she saw me sitting there like,  like a disgusting pig.  And thank God she didn't see what was on the TV.  It wasn't even straight.  What are you going to do, folks? 
[00:24:30]  I do what you got to do.  And then she goes, remember that time we were at that hotel,  and you were jerking off?  And I'm like, what?  That's crazy talk.  That's crazy talk.  And she goes, no, I saw you.  And I go, oh, yeah.  She goes, is this something you need to do?  And I go, no.  But I'd never thought about it before.  And she goes, okay.  Because just so you know, I'm a sure thing. 
[00:25:00]  Like, you can wake me up.  And I went, oh, all right.  And she goes, but if it's really important to you.  She wasn't mad about it.  She was just asking.  She was like, if this is his thing, then I'll give him his space enough where he needs.  But a good jerk is just different.  It's sometimes fun, yeah.  Yeah, it's just different.  I know, but all roads lead back to her for me.  Like, all my fantasies involve her.  Like, a teen website.  I just picture my wife at 16 being sexually active.  And I'm like, oh, you pig.  You're the hottest thing in the world.  I don't think there's anything wrong with a 35-year-old man. 
[00:25:30]  I don't think there's anything wrong with throwing a jerk in.  No, no, no.  There's a white waist one.  I don't know.  I'm trying to get her pregnant.  I'm sorry.  I wish I had that attitude, because he's right.  I mean, it's like, I would rather just want to fuck.  But for me, it's like, a lot of times I'll avoid fucking, or I'll have a half a heart on.  There's been times I have a half a heart on, and I turn the other way so she doesn't feel it.  Because I don't want her to touch it and then want it.  I don't think I get...  You're 40, right?  42, yeah.  And you just get actual unsolicited boners?  Sometimes, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  I have...  I'm fucking older than that.  Well, let's just say Cialis lasts a couple days.  All right.  You just don't get bonus popping up?  Maybe NyQuil and Vicodin took a little wind out of the sails.  I'm a little, Jade.  How'd they fix the neck?  Because people want to know.  I got four massages in two days.  No chiropractor?  No, I'm not going to...  How's a fat guy sitting on my neck?  Because you were locked.  We all saw it.  Your neck was over to the left shoulder.  Let's use logic.  My neck hurts. 
[00:26:30]  I don't want people fucking sitting on it that are like faux doctors.  Is that what they do?  Is Kenny really keeping Billy Hayes from coming in here?  No, why?  Billy can come in.  Come on in, Billy.  Maybe Kenny didn't know if we...  Kenny won't let him in.  Look.  He can come in.  Yeah, Billy can sit on the couch, Kenny.  That's like when I came in last year and Kenny made me sit out there while you guys  talked to Ashley Dupree.  Billy?  He doesn't know.  Oh, we could have used your help on that one.  I want to promote the Chicago date. 
[00:27:00]  Hi, Billy.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Sit down, Billy.  Hi, old.  How are you, brother?  Where are you performing this weekend, Jimmy?  I'm nowhere.  Oh, no, I'm in Columbus.  It's a funny bone.  I forgot.  I wasn't supposed to be until the middle of next month.  Really?  And it got...  Yeah, I totally forgot.  I'm doing two Friday and three Saturday.  Wow.  I never do three Saturday.  Wow.  I did one in Irvine.  First time in probably...  It just came back from Irvine.  Yeah.  Yeah, when I was in Irvine, I did three shows.  First time in probably 12 years.  Oh, you did a three show Saturday?  I was like, I can't do three shows.  Three shows, I walk. 
[00:27:30]  Regan used to do three.  I think Regan was doing four when we...  Didn't you almost do four at Caroline's, too?  Back when we were really rocking?  Yeah.  They were squeezing shows back then.  When we all had heat.  It's tough to do four shows.  Unless you're...  Guys like Louie can blow out ten shows in a week there.  Kevin Hart.  But most people can't do that.  There's guys that are on fire can do it.  Aziz could probably do it.  But most guys can't do it.  Ryan Regan was doing either three or four shows on a Saturday night. 
[00:28:00]  Anyway, so they just worked it out with the massages.  Yeah, it just kept going and they did all different kinds of massages.  What happened, Billy?  Kenny wouldn't let you in?  No.  He's a fucking black child.  But Kenny's in a bad position, though, because he's let people in before and we fucking screamed at him.  Like, he doesn't know who he can let in.  He never knows.  Maybe if I had some type of guidelines you guys could give me.  Yeah, he doesn't know.  We should have told him.  Maybe Billy comes right in and he would have let him in.  Yeah, it's all good.  Yeah.  So where were we? 
[00:28:30]  The Vicodin?  Yes.  So then you got back off it?  So is that GNC bottle gone?  Oh, yeah.  I threw it all off my balcony.  I was like, I surrendered, Opie.  So you threw it off your balcony.  You have to surrender.  What's Lorian?  Yeah.  You can still find him.  Yeah, first floor.  You're going to still find him.  He just dumped it two feet.  I left out of a basement apartment.  Just couldn't take it anywhere.  Why not a book about my mother called Castrating Zionist?  It's the fucking greatest writer ever, Woody. 
[00:29:00]  It's depressing.  My parents and I formed a corporation.  They immediately got together to try and squeeze me out.  Rented out my room, you know.  Why not in the ocean or down the toilet?  It's a spur-of-the-moment thing, Opie.  Why in your backyard?  It was all right.  I had it.  I just threw him off the balcony.  How many did you go grab?  Did you grab just a couple after you had the big moment?  Which time?  Okay.  I'm sure.  It'll sneak up on you, man. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I never did the pill thing.  Pills scare me because I've always figured they'd make me sick.  They didn't make me puke.  They didn't make me sick.  They made me feel fantastic.  Yeah.  Like a nice hum.  Your entire body has a nice hum.  Yeah.  Like, you're not slurring and stumbling into stuff.  You just have this nice hum.  Did you feel like you were...  Like a tuning fork.  Like, right before the sound ends.  Like, that's your whole body.  But did you feel like you were creating?  No, but I did get a bit manic.  Like, I'd jump on my website and answer all the fucking emails. 
[00:30:00]  Like, you know, I'm glad you brought that up, Stan.  You know, when I'm in Ontario in the Inland Empire, 909,  is you guys, like, way too fucking talking to me with strangers.  Sometimes you just want to correct them, though,  when they send an email that's inaccurate.  Even if it's hate mail, you really want to...  Even if they hate you...  Like, if a guy writes me and goes,  you suck, you're not funny.  I'll insult him back,  but I never begrudge the guy that opinion,  because that's fair.  I do.  You missed the whole...  Oh, Jimmy, you missed it, man. 
[00:30:30]  I was here one day out of three years.  You missed it.  Sorry.  What happened?  It's like fucking four times I looked at Jimmy.  You missed it Friday?  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  What happened Friday?  No, I've just...  I quit...  You know, I quit Twitter.  You quit Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been off it for like three weeks, four weeks.  Why?  And then still my mentions are like...  Like, people are fucking...  Because they don't believe you.  They're like special people.  They don't believe you.  They think you're checking it.  Are you checking it?  Because it's just the world's biggest fucking bathroom stall.  And I'm tired of people when I say something positive like, 
[00:31:00]  Hey, I just found out we're filming Suicide Kings 2 in June.  Like, that's a really big deal to me.  Sure.  And the next 40 comments are...  Some of them are funny.  Like, Mannequin 2 thinks this is a bad idea.  Freaking things.  Mannequin 2...  Like, are you going to fuck that one up too?  I just saw hereafter where you dipped in acid.  What happened to your hair?  Like, just like a constant, like, shit festival.  And I'm like, this is fucking...  This is...  I don't want people to have direct access to tell me I suck. 
[00:31:30]  I do that by myself all the time.  And have you ever had jobs where you walk off stage and think that...  Usually it's like a big, like, corporate show if you host, like, the porn awards or something.  Right, right, right.  Where you go, holy shit.  That was a best case scenario.  And then you go on Twitter and you go, I thought it went good.  What the fuck is everybody saying?  Yeah, because they don't get it sometimes.  And they think that they don't understand.  There's a context of the audience.  And a porn crowd is not a great comedy audience. 
[00:32:00]  World of Warcraft.  Like, the BlizzCon crowd.  The gamers.  Those are the biggest cyber bullies I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Jay Moore clearly inebriated.  He was so terrible.  Like, just fucking leave me alone.  I just left the building and 10,000 people were cheering.  I was there.  I'm not a psychotic.  Right.  Or an hysteric.  Where I think, like...  Where I go, that was good.  No, everything was great.  Even though it fucking went terrible, I think it's good. 
[00:32:30]  I know when it doesn't go good.  Yeah, you know when you suck.  I know when I suck.  You don't have to tell me.  That's the easiest part of this job.  I know when I suck.  I got mentions on my phone.  I'm trying to take the app off my phone.  Right.  And all the ones from Friday were positive.  And then you just get a guy like, Jay Moore's a tampon.  It's like, who are you?  Like, what?  Your name is Epic Sax Guy.  Yeah.  Or Vag Poop.  Just block them.  You can always block them.  I don't want...  If you don't want to read them.  Because it doesn't stop them from saying what they want to say.  But I can't not read that initial, you suck.  And then people say, well, you need to have thicker skin. 
[00:33:00]  No, I don't.  I don't need to have thicker skin.  I can take my ball.  And you can go fuck yourself.  And you can go follow fucking Kim Kardashian and Jimmy Fallon.  Or follow CNN.com in case you don't have a fucking TV.  You think Jimmy Fallon gets haters?  Sure he does.  Everyone does.  Who knows?  Oh, you say more than anyone.  Absolutely.  Sure, you're a late night guy, man.  Absolutely.  He's over the top nice.  I just can't imagine that he...  So nice.  Everyone does.  I wonder if we attract the haters.  No, wait.  Every celebrity gets them. 
[00:33:30]  You think it's everyone?  Every person.  Any athlete.  Like fucking Curtis Martin.  Well, the athletes.  Someone right now is going, you ain't no fucking Hall of Famer.  Yeah.  The athletes are obvious.  Because you got, you know, you got the rivalries and stuff.  See, the weird thing is a lot of times if you respond...  I've responded to negative guys.  But sometimes, like, when you know they're the one guy with ten accounts and they have  four followers, it's like, let them say what they want.  Or you can block them.  They can still say it.  You just don't have to see it.  You know, when you block people, you're not stopping them from doing what they want  to do.  You just don't want to have to read what they say.  And that's fair.  Right. 
[00:34:00]  But a lot of times, why address them?  Because nobody is seeing what they say.  It's almost like they're yelling in a room alone.  Yeah.  And you're flying into town, opening their door and going, what'd you say?  It's like...  Very good.  You know what I mean?  It's almost like leave them in the room by themselves.  So Jay's out.  If a tree falls in the woods and, you know, if no one's there to hear it, did it really  fall?  I always said, like, if you block someone that no one knows, did they ever fucking exist?  There's nothing better than a guy with, like, Corey in Buffalo who created 11 different  accounts to fuck with me.  Sure. 
[00:34:30]  Let him.  And then eventually, you know, you report this person as spam.  Like, Frosty will just go...  He's got a relationship with the Twitter people or something.  And they just get fucking kiboshed from the entire Twitterverse.  See, the weird thing is, it's like they want to write nasty shit, and yeah, it will bother  me sometimes.  But then there's other times where I'm like, nah, that's just inaccurate, or that's idiocy.  And when I block them, I never think about them again.  Oh, I don't either.  That's the thing about blocking them.  It stops them from doing nothing.  Did the tree ever fall?  If you block...  That's my point.  Yeah, you don't...  They don't exist. 
[00:35:00]  I literally have seen names come up.  A lot of these guys just will open up another account just to try to, you know, get to you  again.  But I've seen people whose names come up...  It's creepy how obsessive some of these people could be.  Who I forgot about.  Like, I'm like, I forgot that person was a lie.  And it's great.  Yeah.  Because I know they have to think about me.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, I've gotten also legitimate criticism.  You do this wrong, you do that wrong.  Even though it's coming from a guy who's a dick.  It's like, there's been times where people have said things that made sense.  But I also know when they're just being scumbags.  Yeah.  And that's the line, I think. 
[00:35:30]  How did you like Irvine?  I loved it, dude.  I've never been there.  You've got an incredible room.  I could not...  A giant-ass mall.  The Thursday I didn't love, though.  Because Thursday I'd flown and I'd take Dramamine so I don't get sick.  You're like my dad.  Dude, I can't travel.  I'm a terrible traveler.  I took that Dramamine.  It really knocked me out, son.  Gives you a nice little sleep, though.  It really does.  There's 1 a.m. where we live.  So I went on stage Thursday.  And it was good, but it wasn't 100% my crowd.  They were just nice.  Why were they there, then? 
[00:36:00]  They were comedy people.  Disposable income.  So it's the only town in America where they got it.  They all had it.  They just came out.  They just came out.  So it's a good comedy town.  It's the OC.  It's a crazy-ass, we have money to fucking spend crowd.  Wow, really?  They are rich.  Thursday night, they're seeing Jim Norton, and they're not necessarily fans.  A lot of them weren't fans.  But they weren't...  Again, there was no dicks.  There was no heckling.  They were fucking...  That room is fantastic, man.  Did you make it hurt?  I've seen Jimmy where if he's not into a crowd, he'll make it hurt.  No, no, because it wasn't a bad set.  I liked him.  It was just compared to Friday, Saturday, that was the weakest show. 
[00:36:30]  But it was still a good show.  That's some of my favorite things, is to watch you make a fucking audience hurt.  Yeah, I mean, we're all going to go down with the ship.  If it's going badly for the kid, we're all going to suffer.  You feel like we need a shower?  If we're going to do this, we're going to get ugly.  I've seen you get ugly a few times.  And Friday and Saturday was a big...  Was it like O&A crowd?  Was Mad Dog there?  A lot of O&A crowd people.  Mad Dog?  Oh, who's Mad Dog?  Is he a fan, right?  He's always on the...  You know, he emails a lot.  Yes.  What is he?  He was there.  I met him.  And his dad came to my show on...  Him and his dad came out.  He's just this great guy. 
[00:37:00]  Is he a fan of our show?  Big fan.  Yeah, a huge fan.  From the West Coast?  Yeah.  He looks at like a nuclear facility somewhere like in the Inland Empire.  Does he?  Yeah.  It's amazing how you look at these guys and think they're just fucking hardcore lunatics.  And they're geniuses.  Or they have these really important jobs.  He ain't no genius.  No, he's not.  He looks stupid.  Yeah, you.  A true mox.  Well, listen, why don't we take our first break?  Settle in.  I want to get more coffee.  Me too.  Can I tell Jay before we break, before I forget, you did a great job in Hereafter. 
[00:37:30]  And I watched the movie for you.  And all I'm waiting for is that moment that you talked about with Clint and the fucking arm.  Sweetheart.  Did you see her?  And I dropped the letter.  I don't know.  They kept it.  There's two takes.  One take, I dropped it on the floor like a dope.  She hands it to me and I drop it.  Yeah.  And they kept that in?  They go, you know, that's the one he's going to use, because that's real life.  And I go, yeah.  And they go, he really likes you.  And I go, why?  And they go, because a lot of actors, if they drop it, they would go, sorry, I dropped the envelope. 
[00:38:00]  And I'm like, well, are they idiots?  And they go, yes.  You just go with it, right?  Because you never know.  It's real life.  It's make-believe.  Right, right.  That's why I dropped it.  Pick it up and keep going.  I've got to be honest, I haven't seen the movie yet.  Do you like my hair when it's all teased out?  Yeah, it was kind of, it was a different look for you.  What's wrong with that hair?  It looks like I'm a complete bald person with a comb over.  But it was because I didn't want to do Bob Sugar again.  Right.  And that's really, it's written as the guy trying to manipulate his brother to get back into the business like a shark. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  And that was too easy, and I thought it was really one-dimensional.  And I wanted to make him pathetic.  And I don't know if you noticed, my clothes were too big.  Like, browns didn't really match.  Like, an Armani fucking leather coat mixed in with, like, shitty, like, Chess King sweaters and stuff.  But I wanted him to be pathetic enough and really, really love his brother.  Right.  Like Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts in Pope Greenwich Village.  You go, why would he hang out with this guy?  Because he loves him.  Right. 
[00:39:00]  To make him sad and ridiculous enough where it wasn't at all Bob Sugar-y.  That's how I got to see the movie.  Wow.  Fuck.  Yeah, you were great, man.  Oh, Jimmy said that before you came in, too.  The tsunami scene was one of the fucking most...  Fucking unbelievable, man.  There's a tsunami scene in that movie...  Phenomenal.  ...that is better than anything Steven Spielberg has ever fucking cobbled together.  It was tremendous.  Wow.  Like, wacky, weird details that you would never think of in a fucking tsunami.  Yeah, there's certain parts of the movie that were chilling, and there was things tied  in with that part that were fucking really, really good, man. 
[00:39:30]  And then about an hour and a half of the movie in French.  Yeah, there was some...  Anyway...  There was some odd French.  Why didn't more people see this movie, then?  I don't think they knew what it was about.  It was just a very large movie, sort of about Matt Damon talking to dead people, but then  it's this whole British-French...  I don't know.  It felt like almost four vignettes or three vignettes that were tied together.  But it was like...  Because I was wondering, where's Matt...  How come he's not in it more?  And then it really got into his character... 
[00:40:00]  Right.  ...and what he did.  But that scene where you said Clint yelled at that lady, I just...  I couldn't wait for that scene.  What exactly did he say to her?  Sweetheart, where is she?  Keep going.  Keep rolling.  I cannot possibly explain how little this fucking movie is about you.  Christ, I could have hired your arm if the union would have let me.  Let's do it again and not make a big fucking deal out of it.  Got a lot of talent out here.  Wow.  And he just jogged back.  And I was like, oh my...  And then he went back to me and he went, P-U-S-S-Y. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Did I ever tell you that?  No, not the spelling.  He asked me if I wanted to...  Jay, would you like to join me for a Czechoslovakian beer?  And I said, no.  And he goes, well, then I guess you're done for the day.  But he said it like, you fucking faggot.  You sicken me.  And I was like, going back to my hotel in the van, like, did I just get fucking fired?  And I was thinking, talking about an addict brain, I'm like, will I work more?  If I just have this beer?  Like, I'll just fucking pound beers with Clint.  We're done for the day.  It's three in the afternoon. 
[00:41:00]  And I'll just go to a fucking midnight meeting after a nap.  And I said, look, I had to.  Clint said, like, maybe I would have been in fucking J. Edgar Hoover right now.  Yeah.  You know, and I go, no.  And he goes, well, then I guess you're done for the day.  But he said it like Dirty Harry, so it's so freaky.  And we come back the next night or two nights later, and we're the same night as that gal.  I would have hired your fucking arm if they would have let me.  And he says, how long has it been since you had alcohol in your body?  And I go, I don't know, 98, I guess. 
[00:41:30]  And he goes, that's good.  Is your mic on?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, cover it up.  So I cover my mic with my hand and my shirt.  But like Matt Damon and Richard Kine, like everyone, and the boom guy, like they're still all mics.  And he goes, my problem was never booze or drugs.  My problem was always P-U-S-S-Y.  And I thought, did he just fucking spell it so no one could hear it?  Like a crazy person?  And he goes, let's do it again.  And I'm like, now I got to go act knowing Dirty Harry's a pussy addict. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  That's all you can think about now.  I don't even know my lines.  And he's like, all I can think of is like, P-U-S-S-Y.  Box, box, Big Harry 70s box.  And I had no lines because it was that scene.  That is fantastic.  That's awesome.  He spelt it.  Could you have just hung on him and not had the beer?  Like, I would have said, no, but I'll have a soda and hung with him.  He doesn't want to hang with a guy.  It was, would you like to stay and join me for a Czechoslovakian beer?  And it wasn't going to be.  Specific fucking bizarre request. 
[00:42:30]  Jimmy, would you like to sit with me and make tiny orange socks?  Knitting.  Wow.  If I had a beer, you have to look at it.  If you had a beer, you would have had the beer, but then you would have woke up somewhere  and went like, what?  You would have had weird memories of him going like, what the fuck are you doing?  You would have just been doing dirty Harry lines at him until he left.  I think you've taken, I would have just kept doing fucking Escape from Alcatraz when he drops  the N-bomb.  Oh, exactly.  He said, I just don't like niggers. 
[00:43:00]  Jimmy, Jesus.  He said that.  That's what he said.  I know, but we're corporate men now.  That's, hey, look.  One of the greatest lines.  I noticed, uh.  I just hate niggers.  He said that.  What's the matter?  You keep to yourself or you just don't like niggers?  He goes, the English, he goes, there's two reasons you didn't sit on my step.  You scared boy?  Or you just don't, or you just hate niggers.  That's what he said to Clint Eastwood.  Believe me, I know.  He just doesn't want to say.  Oh, please.  It's a great fucking, it's an amazing moment between him and Paul Benjamin.  Right on.  I was there, I actually went to Alcatraz, and I fucking sat. 
[00:43:30]  I was on, you're like Keitel in Bad Luthor.  I was on the set.  I saw him before that take.  He told me he's saying nigger.  Come on, Cal Daniels.  I went there and I sat on that step because it was actually shot in there.  And I love that scene so fucking much.  He walks up a few steps and then he comes back down.  That yard at Alcatraz is just amazing, isn't it?  Oh, fantastic.  I've never been.  Every time.  You gotta go to Alcatraz.  I know, but it's like.  I mean, tourist traps, it's not a tourist trap.  I don't know what the crazy fucking bag of shit I am until I'm on the road and people 
[00:44:00]  go like, you can go to Alcatraz, you can take a trip.  My son's with me, I'll get up and go do a lot of stuff.  Like we'll take a trolley car and we'll go get some crab or whatever.  But then if it's just me and my wife and I'm like, or I could just lay here till 2.33,  get room service, take a nap, and then go to my show.  Or I could go to Chinatown and shop and see what the local culture's all like.  Well, that's.  What am I, fucking Anthony Bourdain pass?  No, I understand to a point, but Alcatraz is way different than just going to Chinatown. 
[00:44:30]  You gotta get on a fucking boat to go to the thing.  But even the boat thing is pretty cool.  It was cool, dude.  It was, I went with my ex.  It's quick, too.  They know how to do that shit.  Why is it closed?  Because somebody escaped?  Yeah, it was probably very expensive to keep people there.  And once the myth of it being escape-proof was cracked, there's probably better prisons  than newer prisons.  Wait, that's a good point.  When did they close it?  Not long after fucking Frank and the Anglin brothers.  Are you sure about that?  Positive.  A couple years later.  Huh.  A year later?  A year and a half later?  How about this? 
[00:45:00]  Clint told us a guy escaped from Alcatraz, and he made it all the way to the foot.  We were under the Golden Gate Bridge in that one scene on the picnic table talking to my  daughter.  I know where that is.  We're looking at fucking Alcatraz with the guy from Escape.  It was like the most surreal moment of my life.  That is pretty cool.  And it was fucking pouring rain.  That's cool.  And we're sitting there dressed like the Gortons fishermen.  Right.  And then all of a sudden, Clint goes, you guys just want to give this one a shot?  And the fucking rain stopped.  I swear to God, it stopped raining when Clint said, what do you say?  Let me just give it a shot. 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  And he said a guy escaped from Alcatraz, got all the way to the rocks.  The current took him past where we were.  He got to the rocks exactly under the Golden Gate Bridge at night, and he got knocked unconscious  in the rocks.  So a jogger found him.  They pulled him out, put him in the hospital, and they realized who he was.  He woke up in Alcatraz.  Oh.  What a fucking asshole.  Wow.  What a fucking unluck of the Irish douchebag.  Holy shit.  That sucks.  Oh, Jesus.  If he just would have woke up and choked out that jogger. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Or just fucking woke up in the hospital a little sooner and fucking said he was a jumper.  What a jerk.  Oh, that sucks.  But why not open it?  If there's prison overcrowding, if you could stick 800 people on an island.  The place is shit.  Yeah, it's old.  It's way too old.  It's not.  It's probably too expensive to run like a real jail.  I went to San Francisco.  Kenny and I went to San Quentin, because the correction officer is a big fan of the show.  I like the photos of you guys.  Oh, you saw them?  Okay.  That was fucking great, man.  The photo outside death row is just amazing.  You said you couldn't wear blue, but then in your photos you're wearing blue. 
[00:46:30]  Couldn't wear blue pants.  No, no, no.  That was a greenish color hospital pants.  Maybe the picture looked blue, but they were a greenish hospital garb color, and I couldn't  wear sweats.  Did they give you that?  Yeah, they have them there for visiting.  They'd see your boner.  Yeah.  That's probably why they'd see my rod.  Same reason you don't wear sweats in the champagne room.  Why can't you wear sweats?  Because you're going to get a ride.  It's too easy to phonicate, phonicate, phonicate.  I think that they were afraid that you blend in, or that's something that convicts wear.  Yeah.  But it was great, because you were right there with them, man. 
[00:47:00]  I'm going next time I'm out there.  You have to.  Fuck yeah.  You're among prisoners.  Me and Billy were walking to Yankee Stadium, the real Yankee Stadium, not the fucking  mall with a logo they got now.  And you had to walk past that fucking jail.  There was that...  What jail is that?  Bronx House of Detention.  The Bronx House of Detention was like three blocks from Yankee State.  You'd park and walk, and they would all sit in the fucking windows.  And yell and scream.  And fucking heckle you.  They would yell shit like, hey, man!  Hey!  Hey, man! 
[00:47:30]  And Billy looks up and goes, hey, that was strawberry.  And he goes, fuck you, man.  I'll come down here and fuck you.  And I go, why don't you go back into a dick?  Like, it's very liberating when you realize, oh my god, not only can they not come after  me, they can never come after me.  Yeah.  They can't get out.  They're caged.  Wow, that's funny, man.  Billy's a problem, I think.  If Billy wants to be a problem, Billy can be a problem.  Billy's number one on my list.  Billy and Rogan would be a good one.  Billy knows how to fight?  Billy... 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Billy had a job that entailed things of that nature.  Billy's a psychopath.  Yeah?  You can't teach rage.  Look at him.  He's just all just lovable over there.  He is a lovable man.  He's just a lovable guy.  We were at an Angels game once.  You want a break?  He's not going to say anything of importance, so we'll just have him in the background.  I love Billy.  Just fuck with you.  The Angels game, or do you want to wait until after the break?  No, he just...  He had B.O. one day at an Angels game.  Remember this?  And I said, you fucking smell so...  And he showered at my house, and I go, I don't know what to tell you. 
[00:48:30]  You fucking smell.  No, the mic above you, Billy, is what I'm...  No, I'm not pointing at the TV.  Grab the mic.  Just in case we need you.  Okay, cock.  I said, you smell so bad.  He goes, fuck you, man.  He gets up from his seat in, like, the second inning, and he leaves.  And I'm like, where the fuck's he going to go?  And then he comes back four innings later, freshly showered and shaved.  He's dressed as a fucking Angels trainer, and he's got shopping bags of swag.  And I go, what happened?  He goes, I went down to the Angels clubhouse.  I took a shower, I got myself cleaned up. 
[00:49:00]  Like, he fucking...  How the fuck did he...  He's that guy.  They gave me a whole...  He's that guy.  How'd you do that?  But explain it.  Who did you know?  We were in the owner's box.  We were in Artie Moreno's box.  And one of the guys came in and said...  Goodness gracious!  I said to him, yeah, do you have a shower or a...  I just came from New York.  I left early and had a...  So, hold on.  I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm going to interrupt you.  I said, how the fuck did you get into the Angels clubhouse?  Absolutely.  And he goes...  It was a long day.  Terry, you remember Terry? 
[00:49:30]  I go, I don't know, fucking Terry.  He goes, yeah, Terry.  Terry who?  Anyway, I said to the gentleman that was coming in with the food and stuff.  I said, his name is Pat Burns.  And I said, we're still friends to this day.  And he said...  Coaching the paper.  He says, can I get you anything?  I said, yeah, how about a shower?  And he said, yeah, sure, come with me.  How fucking homoerotic is this?  And I'm walking past Vladdy's stuff and, you know, Guerrero's stuff.  Right into the fucking...  Right into the clubhouse.  I'm like, this is...  You would think they have all the shower facilities in the whole damn place. 
[00:50:00]  And then I come out of the shower.  Right.  And he had all kinds of fucking Angel paraphernalia for me.  Who did he think you were?  He must have, yeah.  I think he thought I was Jay Moore.  I don't think so.  No, I don't think so either.  But he came back to the seats with all this swag?  And shave...  Like he had fucking shaving cream behind his ear.  That's fucked up.  Like he's in one of Colin's sketches.  You know that guy that everybody was in with a little shaving cream behind his ear.  In case he's on his way to a time. 
[00:50:30]  We're going to break...  We're going to talk about Charles Sheen next because...  I heard he got it back on track last night.  That's what I'm trying to figure out because he bombed in Detroit.  Everyone knows that.  And people say in Chicago, not so bad.  I sent an email out last night to Frosty and everybody.  Fucking book that theater for me.  Now.  And I'm going to call it Warlock Killer.  Fucking Detroit loves when you rally.  I've always defended Detroit.  Best Super Bowl I ever went to.  In Detroit?  They fucking knew...  Protect the old white guys with money. 
[00:51:00]  They had fucking human habit trails going across the city.  So your feet didn't have to touch concrete.  That's how...  That's how they had...  Incredible.  That's how they had it when you used to go to Yankee Stadium.  They had all the fences and stuff.  So you weren't mixing with the locals.  Remember?  Oh, you guys probably didn't drive to the games.  I remember that.  If you drove to the games, they had all the fences set up like the habit trails.  So you didn't have to, you know, mingle.  I want to get to Detroit.  But first, Jimmy Foxwoods.  Friday.  I'm going to be up there. 
[00:51:30]  Are you?  Are you guys doing your show over there, too?  Yeah, we're sold out.  But April 30th, it's holes.  How the fuck are you sold out three months after I'm not sold out?  Well, there's four of us, too.  You have four fan bases.  How do you...  Well, all right.  Let's take the thing.  Yeah, we'll talk about Foxwoods and other places.  Would you play Quiet by Smashing Pumpkins when you come back from break?  Yeah, we could do that.  Quiet.  E-Rock, find that.  I tweeted Billy Corrigan.  He's Billy on Twitter.  I know.  I said, do our fucking show.  We want to talk to you.  Just Billy?  He got Billy.  Billy Corrigan got Billy on Twitter. 
[00:52:00]  That's pretty impressive.  When I go back to Twitter,  I'm going to go JJ and only tweet photos with no comments.  Too late.  Now someone's got JJ.  You never say what you're going to grab.  I'm going to go out as Vag Poop.  What's that guy's real name?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  Let's call his fucking place right during the show.  Probably cunt shit.  Oh, yeah.  Vag Poop is his suit in him.  Jimmy, you're incorrigible.  Yeah, you know, the saltier, the language, the edgier.  You're incorrigible.  Incorrigible.  All right, we'll do some Charlie Sheen next and some other things.  Duh, winning, winning. 
[00:52:30]  Jay Moore at Foxwood's this Friday night.  One show, right?  Yes, sir.  And Jimmy's going to be in Columbus this weekend.  Yes.  First time.  All right.  Stay there.  The virus, Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Entry Show.  That's all right.  We're back.  All right.  Jay Moore wanted to hear the Smashing Pumpkins.  It's quiet.  We had a lot of traction from our music break on Friday. 
[00:53:00]  People emailed me and said they were going to smoke a lot of grass.  Typically, I was told they're doing interval training to this.  Oh, really?  I read something on Twitter about your conversation where you said you can't have a top five Beatles  song.  Did you say that?  I asked Opie.  I said, what are your top five stone songs?  Top five U2 songs?  And then I said, I challenge you to come up with a top five Beatles songs. 
[00:53:30]  Impossible.  And what happened was I started my list and my brain exploded last night.  I actually tried to do what you told me.  And so I tweeted that and people were tweeting their top five Beatles songs all night last  night.  And every list was different.  And I guarantee you, if you say to any of those people that tweeted, what about Happiness  is a Worm Gun?  They go, fuck.  Then they got to redo.  Like I said to Opie in an email, you're going to have to redo, repaste this list over and  over and over again.  And then you're going to realize there's parts of songs that are better than other songs that 
[00:54:00]  are on your list.  Like there's parts of, say, You Never Give Me Your Money, like when that takes off in the  middle and Paul plays his bass crazy super high.  Can I get, I came up with seven before I had to give up and said, I can't do this.  I brought mine with me.  Let me come up with a, he tells me to come in at fucking 615, 630.  I come in, you guys are already in the air.  Well, yeah.  Let me, let me have a pen.  I want him in for the full ride. 
[00:54:30]  You're in for the full ride.  You are.  Get Jimmy a pen.  Jimmy talking about his cold.  The band gets shirts.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Jimmy, are you?  Jimmy gets coldies.  I will swing like a fucking hammer.  Are you a Beatles fan?  Love the Beatles.  I'm more of a Beatles hack, though.  Let me put my list down because I can't come up with a list.  Yeah.  Write your list because.  All right.  Let me help.  Then I did the stones and you too.  Y-E-L-L-O-W.  Oh, Jay.  There's no need to go there.  Can I, can I start?  Hold on.  But Jay, this is not my list.  I told you.  My brain literally exploded as.  That's.  No.  My first day in Law & Order, my wife wrote me, like, have a good day because she was sleeping. 
[00:55:00]  But then she wrote down, these are my acting tips for you today.  Big mouth, dead eyes.  If you can see the audience, the audience is having fun.  Yell all your lines.  When it's someone else's coverage, mouth all their lines.  That's funny.  When in doubt, triple take.  No matter what, make sure your character dies in a comfortable position. 
[00:55:30]  And always walk with the same arm and leg on the same side.  Harder to do than you think.  Yeah, it is.  How many of those are real?  I have four.  Are any of those real?  No!  Mouth the fucking, uh, mouth the, uh.  Well, obviously that one is, uh, the giveaway.  Um.  You already got four Beatles songs?  I do.  I have four that I could probably put in my top five.  I like how he puts his phone over it so there's no cheating.  Eyes on your own paper.  I know.  I'm trying to think of one of this.  I don't want you to ridicule me and then make me want to change it. 
[00:56:00]  Well.  No, I won't.  All right.  I can't think of my.  You want to start easier like U2 and Stones?  I don't like U2, so.  Uh, I'm a big U2 fan.  Stones.  What are your U2?  Stones aren't that easy.  Stones for me was super hard because.  Stones, I mostly stayed in the 70s.  I have personal.  I realized all five of my songs were off of Sticky Fingers.  Uh, yeah.  I, that can't be right.  I had too many from Sticky.  I had to go.  But then I.  What are your, all right, let's do.  What are your Stones?  My Stones, I didn't go tough.  I couldn't. 
[00:56:30]  What the fuck?  I asked you one fucking thing, you fucking.  Look.  Look.  Fucking futurist and contraption bullshit.  Ever have a pen and paper?  It's an iPad.  I don't like the fact that Ope's using his iPad to make his list because now it's a write-off.  All right.  Stones.  I wrote a weekend update piece once that obviously didn't get on the air.  I had my entire living room set and I named everything.  I go, oh, thanks.  I did some shopping this weekend.  I got myself a new ottoman, new couch, new TV.  I got this, uh, Sega Genesis, da, da, da, da, da.  And there's really no, uh, reason I'm here at all except that now that I set it off to 
[00:57:00]  tax deductible.  That's funny.  Oh, very good.  Not to them it wasn't.  End of the line, boy.  All right, listen, I got, I got, Sandler's going to write a song about his thumb.  Left thumb, you are the one.  I love you much more than I love my right one.  I bet you.  Oh, left thumb, how I love thee.  You are much more thick than my pinky.  Adam Sandler. 
[00:57:30]  Jim Norton.  Greg Hughes featuring Billy Hayes.  A coffee guy, Billy Hayes.  Hey, uh, he does fucking smell, doesn't he?  I didn't notice today.  Well, you will.  He's, he's, he's, it's sin coming from the inside out.  He's almost done with his metamorphosis.  Was he a bad boy?  Yeah.  Billy Hayes is a bad boy.  He was, yeah.  Hey, you call.  Oh, really?  All right, listen. 
[00:58:00]  Stones.  Let's, uh, let's start with Gimme Shelter.  Great.  Oh, that's why you threw me the pen, sweetie?  Sorry.  But Jimmy doesn't have his stones.  Do you like his stones?  I got one more stone.  I have one more stone, one more beetle.  To go.  Yes.  All right, hold on.  Let me get Ops.  I'll go with, I'll go with Gimme Shelter.  Perfect.  They let Mary Clayton really fucking sing on that.  They were the first band to go, no, you fucking sing lead, person that no one knows.  Yeah.  It's probably going to be, I have to go Sympathy.  Yeah.  It's great.  I have to go.  I got Sympathy. 
[00:58:30]  You have to go Sympathy for the devil.  You know, I'll tell you what, put it over the top.  I was walking through Central Park with my dog, hi, and I had Get Your Ya-Yas Out, which is  a concert from my, I don't know, 75 or whatever.  Sure.  And Sympathy for the devil live was just fucking crazy.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  What was the last, the last good stone song?  I really liked it.  Waiting on a Friend.  Because I wrote that, yes.  I really?  I didn't like that one, though.  That was the last fucking Rolling Stones song I liked. 
[00:59:00]  Voodoo Lounge is a really good album.  I know, you told me that once before.  You know, Love is Strong.  You're so sweet.  Love is Strong is not a bad song.  But I thought, I thought Waiting on a Friend was the last good Rolling Stones song.  That's not your top five.  No, no, no.  But I just put that down.  Jesus, you scared me for a minute.  I would have to.  Right, Jim?  See, I want to go deeper for you, but it's not going to happen.  No, whatever you like.  You can't always get what you want.  This is coming from the man who said, I wish Deep Tracks wasn't so deep.  Play some hits once in a while.  Fucking zilch. 
[00:59:30]  That is what you said.  I listen to the show, stupid.  Somewhere in between is all.  Just don't go so deep.  I mean, play hits once in a while.  Too good.  All right.  How many is that?  That's three.  Well, hold on.  Shelter, sympathy.  Give me shelter, sympathy.  Get what you want?  I have to go as you can.  I always get what you want.  I don't.  Okay.  That, to me, is your first errant Roman candle right there.  All right.  Then I'll go back to whatever you like.  It's your last one.  No, I know.  Do you, nigga?  What's up?  I'm going to go Midnight Rambler. 
[01:00:00]  That's four.  And, uh, shit.  Wait.  Are these all from?  Yeah.  It's a lot from the same.  Shelter, sympathy, and Midnight Rambler.  Is that all Let It Bleed?  Yeah.  Jimmy, you're the audiophile.  I do think so.  I do have Let It Bleed on here, too, but I'm not really.  Let me work on my list.  That's impossible.  I do have Let It Bleed.  That's impossible that you could possibly squeeze that into your top ten.  I like Let It Bleed.  But we all need someone we can lead on. 
[01:00:30]  A fucking throwaway.  Um.  Fuck.  By the way, the news media, don't run Charlie Sheen losing on an endless loop if it fucking  went well last night.  I mean, they're just twat.  We're not really sure how well it went.  I want to try to get some people that were at the show.  That would be kind of cool.  So what's five?  Yeah, what's five?  Fucking.  Shut up.  What's number five?  Shut up.  Don't you do show prep?  Yeah.  I was on you all weekend.  Look.  Look at all the songs that I. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, but I asked for five.  You had a list of 30.  Now you're going to whittle it down.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It ain't the.  I don't go.  It ain't the BCS, Hope.  Jesus.  I fucking.  Yeah, I want to go.  My riff gun jammed.  That's right.  I don't know what BCS is.  Bowl championship series when they pick who plays in one.  No, I know.  I was there for the Tonight Show and I still couldn't remember what it was.  I'm going to have to go.  They've been very good to us, the Tonight Show, you and I.  Yes, they have been.  Are you doing those pieces too?  No, I just.  I'm their buddy Hackett.  Oh, okay.  Someone fell out. 
[01:01:30]  Can you come on with Justin Bieber?  That's great.  No.  I'll go.  I'll go Ruby Tuesday.  I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the  Goddamn coming, Curtis, and you gave him a reach around.  You just picked the random one and that works.  No, that's the one that was up.  He's just kidding a little fucking manners.  I want to.  He's just kidding a little fucking manners.  Right away.  Get the fucking impression.  Are you fucking java logging me right now? 
[01:02:00]  Hold on.  So, let's make believe that Let It Bleed made it onto your list.  Well, it's on the list to choose from.  So, but let's take out sympathy for the devil.  No, you can't take sympathy out.  No, you have to.  No, you can't.  So, your list is Give Me Shelter, Can't Always Get What You Want, Midnight Rambly, Ruby  Tuesday, and Let It Bleed?  What are you, a fucking housewife? 
[01:02:30]  I didn't say it.  Running for the shelter of your mother's little helper.  Things are different.  No, that's fucking on my list.  Love Mother's Little Helper.  No, no, no.  Put my list back together.  It's just your...  It's right here.  I didn't take it apart.  I didn't go with Let It Bleed.  It's a fucking jank.  All right.  I didn't go with Let It Bleed.  Shelter, sympathy, get what you want, Midnight Rambly, Ruby Tuesday.  I want a fucking Nancy.  Ruby Tuesday, you might...  I guarantee if you check your Twitter right now with everyone's list... 
[01:03:00]  I'm not going to check.  Ruby Tuesday, you're the only...  You might as well just have written fucking Java Log.  All right.  Well, I wanted...  You should have written Sunset Photo.  How about...  No, that's it.  You're done.  How about Monkey May?  Well, which is it?  I was on my short list.  Why is it a gelatinous ambious?  I'll stick with my list.  I'll live by that list.  I have Mother's Little Helper on my list.  I love that turn.  You have Ruby Tuesday instead of Monkey Man.  That's what we're sticking with.  That's the fucking story you're telling me.  Because it makes for a better radio if I keep Ruby Tuesday on my list. 
[01:03:30]  You should stand up with your list.  I would live and die with my list.  Never let anybody talk you out of your list.  That was a white Denzel impression.  Of course it was.  That's what you're telling me, right?  All right.  That's what you're telling me.  Monkey Man is a great song, though.  No, I'll stick with that.  Ha ha ha!  Okay.  Jay, it's to you.  No, Jimmy.  I'm closing it.  Jimmy?  Mother's Little Helper.  Let me write these down.  Angie.  Oh, fuck Angie.  God damn it.  Paint It Black.  You know what?  Sympathy.  Hold on, Jimmy.  What do you think I am?  In a stenography class or something? 
[01:04:00]  This guy writes so slow, you'd think he's left in.  Paint It Black.  Paint It Black.  What was it?  It's Angie, Mother's Little Helper, Paint It Black, Sympathy, and Tears Go By.  Damn.  Tears Go By.  I fucking, they did the first one they wrote, I think.  Well, yeah, and then, uh, what's her name did it?  Marion Faithfull sang it first, but that was the first one that Keith and Mick wrote.  Tears Go.  There's a, there's a version of them doing it on fucking Ed Sullivan.  It's fucking phenomenal.  That's my favorite Stones song, probably. 
[01:04:30]  You guys went, uh, like, you guys went, like, got live if you wanted on me.  Well, I'm not, but again, I'm not, I'm not as big a Stones fan where I can't go as  deep with the Stones or Beatles as a lot of guys can.  I think my list is better.  I think I fucked it up with Ruby Tuesday.  Yeah, I would say, I'm going to trade out, I'm going to trade out Ruby Tuesday.  For what?  Monkey Man?  Satisfaction.  Under My Thumb came off the list so Angie could go on.  Really?  I love Under My Thumb.  If I want your satisfaction, I'll put on fucking WPLJ, you ate it.  Satisfaction.  Just ridiculing his list. 
[01:05:00]  I know, fuck you.  What's your favorite color?  Green.  What is your motherfucking name?  Jesus Christ, dude.  Really, we're just, can't you hear me knocking?  Thanks.  I got two coffees now.  I had it on my short list.  I should have picked it.  You hear Keith with a chord change in that.  Thank you.  Alright, I got Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Symphony for the Devil, Midnight Rambler, I got the  Blues, which is Keith Richards' favorite Stones song of all time. 
[01:05:30]  And here's the one that you guys are going to go, what's that?  And then when you play it, you're going to go, fingerprint file.  I don't know that song.  It's fucking crazy.  What album is that off?  It's only rock and roll.  Mick Taylor's finest fucking work.  Crank it, crank it, crank it.  Oh, this is better than Ruby Tuesday?  Tell me.  Listen how coked out Mick is.  He's so coked out, his voice went higher. 
[01:06:00]  Say something, Mick.  Jesus.  I'm listening to him.  It's good.  Oh, if you smoke a little grass, walk your dogs through Central Park.  I'd check this out.  I would too, but the music reminds me of a chase music from Freebie and the Bean.  The fucking music itself.  Is that the follow-up to Slappy and the Shankers? 
[01:06:30]  You ever saw Freebie and the Bean?  No.  It's a 70s movie.  I think James Cahn's in it.  Jay.  Two Cops.  I'm doing center stage tomorrow, and Jimmy Cahn's doing it in the morning, so I'm going  to go early to see him punch him right in his fucking face.  What's center stage?  The Michael K. show on...  It's like an actor's studio, but Michael K. somehow has become this great interviewer.  You know, Will Ferrell, as a rap gift on Elf to James Cahn, got him the trilogy for  The Godfather, and in the card he wrote, the first one's kind of boring with the other 
[01:07:00]  two.  Will Ferrell give that to James Cahn?  Jimmy Cahn was not fucking...  Why'd that get turned off?  Why wouldn't he laugh at that?  No.  What?  That's hilarious.  He can't take a joke?  I hate actors.  Fuck him.  He can take a joke.  He just got...  I think it's because Will Ferrell, they say, is completely unfunny between takes at all.  Like, he's just a regular guy.  No.  Bah.  You don't have to play my song.  That's hilarious.  It's the best thing I've ever heard. 
[01:07:30]  Jay, with such a catalog, why this song?  Stevie Wonder on Clavinet.  It's a cool song, but I mean, you're talking about the Rolling Stones.  This one?  Can you go back to the very beginning?  It really fuck...  What?  It fucks me up.  What's that?  Okay. 
[01:08:00]  What about Ruby Tuesday?  Ruby Tuesday is gay.  All right.  Your list sucks.  My list is great.  Both of you.  No, my list...  We had three of the same songs, Jay.  Put on fucking Tears Go By.  It's fucking phenomenal.  Tears put on Ruby Tuesday.  All right.  She would never say where she came from.  Wait, you don't have Tears Go By by the stones and the shitty thing?  Are you spelling Tears?  We have to have Tears Go By.  T-I-E-R-S.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, T-E-E-R-S.  That's funny.  That's what I thought you were saying.  No, I was thinking T-E-E, which is not a word, but that's actually funny.  Tears Go By.  Look at these fucking balloon heads on Fox.  These guys are so hilarious.  All right, fade that out there.  Who doesn't like Tears Go By?  Yeah, it's fucking fantastic.  Play it.  Just go to YouTube.  Go to the Ed Sullivan fucking version.  Ryan Jones guitar gives me pitch shivers every time.  In a bad way.  Yeah.  I bet you don't like it.  You don't like this song?  No, I like this song. 
[01:09:00]  I love this.  I would put this on the list and take Ruby Tuesday off now.  Can I do that?  Dude, it's your list.  I like this guitar.  I believe it's his teardrop guitar.  Yeah.  Oh, this is the actual version.  It's not the Ed Sullivan version.  All the girls are screaming.  Can I ask E-Rock if he looked up Tears Go By and that's why he couldn't find this song?  That's exactly what I did. 
[01:09:30]  What?  It's As Tears Go By.  That's why he couldn't find it in the system.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Maybe I said it wrong, bro.  I want to hear the truth.  It's fantastic.  That's what he wants to hear.  There's a great version of fucking a Luke Goddard fucking movie where Marianne Faithful sings this acapella.  I'm very conscious of mocking other people's lists now, so I'm biting my tongue.  Oh, you can attack my list.  What's wrong with his list?  I will never back off.  I will die with this song in my fist. 
[01:10:00]  I like that.  To me, The Stones is about dueling guitars and, like, a fingerprint file.  It sounds like a fucking buzzsaw started.  I'm going to check out that whole song when I get home today.  I've never heard that song before.  People are saying I should have grabbed Monkey Man.  Where's the...  Monkey Man.  I should have grabbed Monkey Man instead of Ruby Tuesday or my list was perfect.  Monkey Man in fucking Goodfellas.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Angie's a fucking very good song.  Angie is a very good song.  With no loving in our soul and no money in our coach.  What a great lyric. 
[01:10:30]  Coach.  I never understood why...  They're calling you the angry list maker.  Yeah.  I am.  You get very angry.  Yeah.  And people want Waiting on a Friend on that list.  Nah, I shouldn't.  I think that was the last great Stones song.  Voodoo Lounge is a...  I'm telling you, Voodoo Lounge is a...  I'm going to have to check it out again.  You're wrong!  I'm on the Beatles.  You're an asshole.  It ended with Tattoo You.  You're an idiot.  The Beatles forget it.  I'm so hot for her, she's so cool.  I love that song.  What song is that?  I'm so hot for her, she's so cool. 
[01:11:00]  Okay, there you go.  I want to know the Beatles, or you want to do more Stones.  I have weird taste, though.  Like, Florentine one time got in my car, and he goes, if someone stole your car, they're  going to think this is a gay guy's car, because of all the stations I had programmed.  So I'll...  Wait, what stations do you have programmed?  Not now anymore, but I'm saying I used to have fucking, you know...  Not now, you know how I used to be.  Yeah.  Now I have satellite.  But what were the stations?  I think one of them was KTU.  There was so few choice, there was no rock stations in New York.  Right. 
[01:11:30]  K-Rock blew.  Well, yeah, but you're the type of guy who wouldn't listen to a regular rock station ever.  No, that's right.  There were people on hold in New York, Long Island, and Long Island.  Are they going to go up to Foxwoods and come see my show?  They better.  Fuckers.  Jay Moore at Foxwoods on Friday.  Let me...  Hold on.  Eddie Trunk had a Van Halen list, and he left a fucking unchained...  We killed Eddie Trunk.  He had a maiden list for his rock and roll book, and he left off his essential playlist.  Like, ten songs.  Which makes the book a great read, and he goes, ah, that's a throwaway part of the book.  I'm like, no, you idiot.  It's all we've been fucking talking about. 
[01:12:00]  You open to the page and go, oh, what's the Van Halen ultimate playlist?  And I'm fucking Iron Maiden.  This fucking dingy prick left off Run for the Hills and fucking Number of the Beast.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  Then we called him out, and we're like, you're too cool for the room.  That's ridiculous.  He said, quote, that's only 2% of the book.  I go, really?  Because it's all we care about.  I don't give a shit about your fucking stories about the man Rainbow.  His book was...  The photos in that book are fantastic, though.  I loved it.  The book's going to do well.  Well, let me say hi to Victor in Baltimore.  Victor.  Star's good. 
[01:12:30]  Cigars and scotch.  Sorry.  I almost got fired over that.  Over what?  Well, it's a famous...  Star, fucker, star.  That's why he's bringing it up.  Well, we did a hacky radio bit when I was in Buffalo called Pick Your Stones.  And I took a call from this guy.  He goes, can you play star?  I go, oh, great song.  And I recorded the phone call.  I go, great song.  Here it is.  Your Pick Your Stones weekend.  And boom, played it.  I had no idea.  I didn't even know the song.  I was just fucking faking it.  And they were doing a live broadcast from a car show. 
[01:13:00]  And it was cranking through the speakers.  Fuck a star.  Fuck a star.  And my PD called me and basically wanted me fired.  You stick the fruit deep inside of you.  I bet it.  Keep your pussy clean.  Turn this up.  It's a good song, man.  Better than fucking Ruby Tuesday.  Did you read Keith Richards' book?  Incredible.  I read the first chapter.  I'm so bad with books, but I love what I read, man.  Well, who wants to carry that around with me?  It's so heavy.  I said, what is this?  That's the problem.  A bunch of books taped together?  We all laughed.  Yeah.  It's exactly in his voice, which, as you know, from a publishing house, it's impossible 
[01:13:30]  to pull off.  To not have some fucking asshole's fingerprints on your words.  Right, right, right.  I love this great song.  This is good.  Just imagine, like, in 1990, this was an FCC violation.  And I'm a dopey fucking nobody playing this.  But this is why.  They didn't know they were saying fuck on the fucking car show. 
[01:14:00]  Some fucking asshole nervous Nelly had to go, do you know what this song means?  I had to have a meeting and all that crap.  I had to swear I didn't know the song.  They thought I did it on purpose.  Let's go to Victor in Baltimore.  Victor.  Hold on.  Victor.  Yeah, I hear you.  It's hard to hear you over that fucking head.  Hello, Vic.  Thanks.  All right, turn down, fucking star.  What's up, Victor?  Look, man, I'm driving into work, and I'm sitting here listening to the same show from  Friday.  You guys are just putting lists together of fucking songs. 
[01:14:30]  You have top-notch women.  You have some comedians in the room here.  I don't like the way you corrected yourself, Victor.  This is Jay Moore's bit.  We had to do our homework.  How's it a bit?  We all like to do it.  We all like to do it.  Everyone likes to do a music list.  Absolutely.  And by the way, the Twitter and the phones, they're digging this, because they're all coming  up with their list.  I just happened to mention it, because Open Jay talked about the Friday show, which I've  heard about, Ad Infinitum.  Apparently, it was one of the greatest shows ever that I missed, so I wanted to fucking 
[01:15:00]  be a part of it.  Well, his Van Halen list was rough, too.  What's that?  Where do you work?  Oh, I'm not going to say where I work.  Why would you?  What type of job do you do?  You know where we work.  Yeah, you know where we work.  Where do you work?  I work for a...  Don't make some stupid shit up.  Just tell me where you work.  No, no, no.  I work for a company that manufactures something that there's so little companies that do it,  if I even say what they manufacture.  Well, Victor, I think what you do at your work fucking sucks, and you're a fucking piece  of shit, and I think your company should fire you, and I can't believe you even had 
[01:15:30]  that job.  You're so fucking stupid at it.  Let me tell you what, I don't...  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You suck fucking bull.  Your parents named you Victor.  Can you imagine a baby in a diaper?  What's your baby's name?  Victor.  Nice.  You're a fucking piece of shit faggot.  This is my baby.  What's your baby's name?  Victor.  I have a fucking kid in a onesie and a fucking binky in his mouth named Victor.  What a fuck.  No wonder you're such a fucking angry piece of garbage. 
[01:16:00]  What's your Twitter name?  V-Man kills it?  Fuck.  You know what?  You are so right.  Being a father, the name of your kid has to make sense when it's an infant.  This is my child.  Victor.  Can you picture a baby in the mall in a stroller?  Like, oh, he's a cute little guy.  What's his name?  Victor.  That's my son, Victor.  That's a name that makes sense when he turns 30.  Your job's...  You suck at your job, Victor.  How do you even still have your fucking job?  If I suck at my job, I kill people, for one. 
[01:16:30]  And number two, I don't go up to my boss and give him a top ten list of places I've worked.  Oh, shit.  But what does that mean?  What the fuck?  That didn't mean anything.  That didn't make any sense, you blathering idiot that shouldn't have...  You were on to something, but then you fell.  I gave Opie a list of ten...  Listen, asshole.  I gave Opie a list of ten places that I've worked?  What the fuck are you talking about?  I could name ten radio stations if that helps you.  Victor, tell us how the show should go today, and we will actually...  No, no, no, I want to know more about Victor as an infant. 
[01:17:00]  I swear to God, because your job as a parent, when you have a son or a daughter, you've got  to come up with a name that makes sense when they're infants and when they're adults.  And unless you're like a World War II vet, Victor ain't cutting it.  Right.  Victor is almost walking.  I'm not named after a bird.  I don't get it.  Ooh, Jay.  I'm not either.  My name's John, stupid.  Go to a fucking Wikipedia once in a while.  All right, Victor.  Victor, what's your job? 
[01:17:30]  I drive a tractor-trailer.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So you're a fucking truck driver, just like Elvis Presley.  No, no, no.  I identify myself a little better.  I used to be a regional airline pilot.  I don't do that anymore, because the pay is horrible.  Okay.  Well, there you go.  Are you scared when you hit turbulence as a pilot?  No.  But you still are a horrible, horrible fucking comedian.  Victor, I have...  Really?  I have a flying question.  Based on...  Hold on, Jimmy.  Okay.  Based on what do you come up with that? 
[01:18:00]  Based on when I play Baltimore and you come see my show and laugh and go, holy shit, that  was one of the better shows I've seen?  You do one thing well.  You do a walking impression.  Oh, no.  I don't tell stories well?  What?  Do you like this...  No, no, no.  I don't want you to hang up.  I want you to stay on the phone.  Wait.  Can I...  I'm not going anywhere.  Hold on.  I got to jump in this phone call.  This phone call started with, you have two great comedians on the show today.  But then he adjusted it.  He went two comedians.  Yes, two comedians.  But you said...  Hey, listen.  You have a comedian named Jim Norton whose basic talk is about sex and dicks and pussies. 
[01:18:30]  That's not true.  Then why are you listening, Victor?  It seems like you don't...  Victor, have you seen...  You don't want to pass you by.  If I may.  Victor, have you seen me do live stand-up comedy?  No, I wasn't.  Then what the fuck are you talking about?  You fucking failed airline pilot who got kicked out for smoking grass with cloudy piss?  You're laughing, you fucking stooge.  That means I've made you laugh.  That's my job.  I'm laughing because the thought of a failed airline pilot is one who runs into a mountain. 
[01:19:00]  As a pilot, were you scared when you hit turbulence?  I always wondered that.  No, of course not.  Jimmy, you're so stupid.  I'm wondering.  He's talking down to you.  I don't care.  He's having no...  I don't...  I'm not offended by...  Hold on, Victor.  At least let's chat.  I'm not offended by Victor.  Victor, and after we hang up, I will forget he was ever alive.  Victor, I'm confused.  It seems like you don't like...  Victor, have you ever seen me do stand-up comedy?  I've not.  Just a yes or no.  Just yes or no.  No, but...  Okay, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:19:30]  Have you ever seen me tell...  Wait, Victor.  Wait.  Slow down, Victor.  Have you ever seen me...  I know you're used to having the mic on your airplane and telling people they're about  to fucking go into a cornfield.  I wrote that.  Cornfield I wrote.  That's mine.  Victor, have you ever seen me tell stories about my child?  About your child?  My child.  No.  See, the concept of me telling stories is so foreign to you that you have no idea what  I do comedically.  Well, let me ask you this.  Why the hell do I care about your child? 
[01:20:00]  What?  My...  Because you just said I was a terrible comedian, so unless you've seen me do comedy...  You wouldn't know he's a terrible comedian.  How could you base...  You are an interrupting, ignorant ignoramus.  He's awful.  Your comedic genius is based around your child?  Victor.  No, I tell stories in my show about my personal life and about my child and my marriage.  Have you ever seen any of these stories being told, ever?  Have you ever gone on YouTube and seen clips of me on stage telling stories? 
[01:20:30]  I have seen clips on YouTube of you telling stories, yes.  Which...  You're lying.  Name one.  I'm being honest.  But what I'm telling you that is you're...  You suck.  I mean...  All right.  Let me take this.  Seriously.  Let me...  All right, Victor.  Victor.  Victor, shut the fuck up for a second.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Now, you say Jay sucks.  You kind of gave Jimmy sort of a backhanded compliment, I think.  So, basically, you don't like the three voices that are coming from your radio today. 
[01:21:00]  So, why are you listening?  That doesn't make sense.  Because it's like a car wreck, you know?  Is it?  Is that what we do?  You take your eyes off of it.  But that's...  You're lying when you say that.  Yeah.  I think we turned you when we made fun of your name because it's a little weird to call a  baby Victor.  Right?  Picture a kid in, like, a onesie with little anchors on it.  And he's holding, like, a bankie, and he's got a little thing of goldfish crackers in  that stupid gyro bowl.  Like, what's his name? 
[01:21:30]  Victor.  I'm sure we're insulting other Victors out there, but I'm sorry.  It's a terrible name.  It's a weird name for a toddler.  Do you spell it with a C like a faggot or at least a K like a Russian?  Hey, listen.  This is how horrible your show stops.  Yeah.  You have spent the last seven minutes talking to basically what you call a zilch.  Just say it is zilch.  Don't preface it with we call a zilch.  Just say what you wanted to say.  Say we've wasted seven minutes talking to a zilch, and you are correct.  We did.  And it made the show way better because they are lit now, these phones.  They all want to talk to Victor the douchebag. 
[01:22:00]  Hold on, Victor.  Can we have Victor and Jason on at the same time?  Jason from Virginia Beach?  Jason.  So, Victor, listen Friday, and he's listening again today.  It doesn't make sense.  Yeah, I know.  Victor, Jason, are you there?  Yeah, Jay.  How are you?  Victor says I'm a horrible stand-up comic that all I do is a Christopher Walken impression.  Now, Jason's seen me live, according to the notes here.  Yes, I saw you at Anaheim years and years ago, and you're a great storyteller, a great  comedian. 
[01:22:30]  Victor is a fucking dickhead, dude.  He's never seen you live.  Victor, are you going to take that?  I've been listening to Opie and Anthony since the first day they came to sound.  Victor!  Hey, remember the way it is.  First off, I didn't say that all you do is a Christopher Walken impression.  Yes, you did.  Listen, I said you did a good Christopher Walken impression.  You said I'm a shitty comic that all I can do is a Christopher Walken impression.  You did Christopher Walken ten fucking years ago, dude.  Get up with Jay Moore.  He's been on hit TV shows. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, you're...  Wait till he does Norm MacDonald later.  You're Norm MacDonald.  You don't need to talk about Norm MacDonald.  You're the guy who wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for Adam Chandler.  Wait, no.  We're talking about my impression of Norm MacDonald.  Well, that sucks, too.  And I don't know that...  That sucks also?  Okay.  And is Adam Sandler really connected with Norm MacDonald?  No, they've never done a movie.  Justin!  All right.  Hold on.  Keep everyone on, Opie.  I got it.  Justin!  No, it's Jason.  It's Jason.  Jason?  No, no.  Justin's in Florida. 
[01:23:30]  All right, boys.  I'm pushing out.  No, no, no.  Let him go.  Who cares?  Goodbye.  No, that'd be funny.  I have six guys on the line just yelling so we don't have to talk.  Oh, no, yeah.  Hey, by the way, Adam Sandler is connected to Norm MacDonald.  Have you ever seen Billy Madison?  He was in that movie as well.  Oh, I didn't know that made him a fucking made man in comedy.  Jesus Christ.  Now, how do you think of Adam Sandler?  Is he more your style?  No, Adam Sandler has one problem, and what that is is...  Fix comedy for us, Victor.  Yeah, he's opinionated this, Victor. 
[01:24:00]  He's doing one thing and one thing only, and he acts like a retard.  Unfortunately, that's made him millions of dollars.  Why is it unfortunate?  I'm sure it's for his...  What comics do you really like, Victor?  Well, I like a few.  I'll tell you, you're going to laugh and you're going to yell at me, but I do like Jeff Dunham  a little.  He's okay.  I've not...  There's a few, okay?  Who else?  Who else?  Yeah, who else? 
[01:24:30]  Two for two with the buttons, by the way.  No, no, Jeff Dunham.  Who else?  It's random, too.  I know, it's random.  For the people that are going to stick with us today, Jay has no clue what button he's  pushing, he's just...  And he's two for two so far.  Who else now besides Jeff Dunham?  Fair enough.  Yeah, who else, Victor?  So you like a good...  Victor likes a good puppet show.  Well, I also like Larry the Cable Guy.  I like...  You're a fucking total asshole.  You are really like the fucking lowest common denominator of fucking people. 
[01:25:00]  Look, you picked two comics that obviously have a big following.  Yeah.  I'm not even saying...  I'm not saying anything about the comics.  I don't know if all the comics respect those two that you just mentioned.  I won't badmouth the comics.  No, I won't either.  They know what they're fucking doing.  Great.  Fucking, if you're a plumber and you have a van and you fix the fucking pipes, good for  you.  If you're a comic and people leave your show happy, great.  But, Victor, you're just proving yourself to be just a deplorable person.  Who else?  Make your top five, because we're doing top fives today.  Yeah, top five.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  What are your top five comic lists?  I'm going to write these down, Victor.  You got three to go over there, Victor. 
[01:25:30]  Victor in Baltimore.  Okay, unfortunately, I don't typically make a list of top things I like.  Well, we're asking you.  Yes, we're asking.  You got enough time to be a guy for once.  Just go.  Okay.  Larry, the cable guy.  Yeah, I listen to...  Jeff Donham.  I like Bob Marley.  No, comics.  Yeah, Bob Marley from Boston.  Oh, Bob Marley the comic?  Yeah.  Yeah, who else?  Exceptional.  Is he good, Jimmy?  I've never seen him do his act.  He's great.  Great guy.  All right.  Uh, who's the guy that's, um...  I don't know.  It's your list.  I'm going to help you, stupid. 
[01:26:00]  It's your list, you fucking idiot.  Oh, shut up.  You shut up.  Drive your fucking truck into an irrigation ditch.  Oh, you're laughing at a comic you don't like.  Yeah, you better not laugh at that.  Two more there, uh...  Victor.  This is my baby, Victor.  Oh, he's so cute.  You got him in the little jumpy chair.  What's his name?  Opie, what's your baby's name?  Victor.  You named your son Victor?  Yeah, I sure did.  Okay.  Family name?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, now, you're going to make fun of my name, which I don't mind at all. 
[01:26:30]  That doesn't hurt.  No, you do mind.  You're above it.  You do mind.  Who's next?  By the way, we can hear you smiling, douchebag.  Yeah, now let's get the two other comics for your top five list.  Let's go.  I do like, um, John Campanella, I believe his name is.  John Campanella?  The guy that does the Harry Carey impression and you're making fun of my fucking walking?  Hey, I'm...  Hey, here's a guy that's been dead for a while.  And I'm going to close with it.  I don't know.  It's the other guy who they compare to Larry the Cable guy.  I don't have his name right off the top of my hand, but when he does... 
[01:27:00]  Top of your head, not top of your hand.  What a fan, you idiot.  When he does a set, I know exactly who it is.  But hey, but let me tell you this.  Victor...  No, you got one more.  Yeah, one more.  Victor started crawling today.  You want...  You want the one comic that...  Stop laughing.  It's not funny, remember?  One more.  We asked you for a list.  Fair enough.  You gave four, three names, one, some guy from whatever, and...  Now the Jeff Dunham count is one or five.  Yeah.  Jay, would you mind burping Victor for me, please? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Oh, let's see.  Okay.  You can't come out of a pussy with an adult name.  Ralphie May.  I kind of like Ralphie May.  Oh, see, that's not fair because, you know, Jay likes the Ralphie May.  You know what?  I'm going to call Ralphie right now and tell him he's fifth on this fucking list.  He's going to come to your fucking house and kill you.  Hey, that list...  All right, Victor, we're done with you, Victor.  You suck balls.  We're done.  You're just a fucking piece of garbage.  We just got you, by the way, to make a list like a little bitch. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  We made you do exactly what you complained about.  You called up expressing an opinion.  You didn't like the list.  And we said, make a list, bitch.  And you made one.  That was insane, but what I'm saying now...  No, no, no.  Acknowledge that, though.  Acknowledge that we did make you make a list like a bitch and you didn't want to.  And you laughed the entire time, also.  You giggled the whole way, Victor.  Admit it.  I helped you make a list to further show how ridiculous...  No, I don't think it's ridiculous anymore.  That's Twitter to me. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  That...  Fuck you, Victor.  Here's...  That's Twitter.  You suck, you suck.  Hey, we're all part of the same thing, right?  Having a good time.  No, you fuckers.  If you open with how bad I suck, you don't...  Step two isn't...  No, we're all just joking.  Hey, right away, getting fucking fresh.  What was your little animal shit?  What was your...  Is that so?  Who made you pope in this dump, huh?  No, three for three.  Be careful, though.  Be careful.  You're going to lose your streak.  I thought that was the fucking...  Hold on.  Would you love your country?  Yes, sir.  How about getting with the program? 
[01:29:00]  Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?  I love that guy.  Who is that guy?  He's the great from the fucking Full Metal Jacket.  What's that?  Some kind of thing, Duke?  I don't remember him.  Oh, he's the fucking greatest.  Will you stop interrupting?  You're a woman.  Jesus Christ, Vic.  What is it, Victor?  Are we done with Victor?  Yeah, Vicky.  Stop interrupting.  Vicky.  Vicky.  Vicky, come and meet my brother, Jake.  Yeah.  What, Victor?  See, he's laughing again.  Come on. 
[01:29:30]  Victor, we're waiting for you.  Yeah, go ahead, Victor.  Oh, he's gone.  That was him, not me.  I was just about to say his fucking phone number on the air, too.  Let it be known.  Chris on Long Island.  What's up, Chris?  Wow, I forgot what I was here for.  Oh, top five stone list.  Can we go back to that?  Or should we just rank on Victor some more?  Victor doesn't like it, so we're going to stop doing it.  I want to pick this top five list to transporting people and things.  Wait, first of all, I want to know.  What's the stuff you're going on?  Yeah, the top five ways you bring shit places and people. 
[01:30:00]  Are Yak and Rickshaw on it?  Oh, my God.  Zilch.  He's a fucking backpack.  Plane.  Plane.  Donkey, Yak, and Rickshaw.  Plane and truck.  Who said that?  Here's Chris.  Chris.  Good point, Chris.  Who just said that?  Chris.  Chris.  God damn, Chris.  You are funny.  Right on, Chris.  No, Jay.  No, Jay.  You're funny.  Oh.  Now?  Real quick, I'll go back to my stones list.  Can you hear me knocking?  Absolutely.  Wait, can we?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I want to do a couple things right now. 
[01:30:30]  I really need to know who had the best top five stones list.  I don't know how we do it.  Maybe through Twitter or something.  And then I want to hear yours.  But can we?  All right.  My list was Gimme Shelter.  You can't always get what you want.  Midnight Rambler.  Ruby Tuesday.  Sympathy for the Devil.  Jay?  Can't you hear me knocking?  Fingerprint file.  Sympathy for the Devil.  I got the blues.  Midnight Rambler.  And Jimmy.  Usually I have the same list as you guys without the gay songs.  Tears Go By, Sympathy for the Devil, Painted Black, Mother's Little Helper, and Angie. 
[01:31:00]  Fucking Jimmy might win.  No way.  I love Jimmy.  Jimmy's definitely in third place.  But I like that Jimmy's going to die with his list.  Oh, yeah.  No, As Tears Go By is a solid fucking song.  How?  I listen to that.  That's a solid fucking song.  It's a fucking elevator song.  That's a good one.  As Tears Go By.  It's great.  There's no bass.  There's no electric guitar.  Ding.  You should hear Mick and fucking Keith doing that on fucking Ed Sullivan.  Oh, the gals were going bonkers.  All right, Chris, what do you got, brother?  I have to pick Jimmy just because of Angie. 
[01:31:30]  Whoa, Jimmy!  Fuck, I wanted Angie on my list.  God, I think Victor pooped his pants.  I fucked my list up with Ruby Tuesday.  I think Victor pooped his pants, too.  All we're going to talk about is this list for the next two hours.  Victor pooped his pants.  I notoriously make better lists than other people.  You do make a good list.  I've been known my entire life.  It's pretty fucking strong.  Arguably as the best list maker in any room I'm in.  I've been told that many times.  And the best list maker.  The best.  It's very tough.  Say best list maker.  Best list.  Yeah, it's hard.  It's tough. 
[01:32:00]  It just trips you up a little bit.  A little sometimes.  Let's make a list of top five hard things to say.  See?  I'm right there on top of it.  You want something else.  Fucking a lot of people saying Jimmy's list is the best.  I don't know how.  Chris, go ahead.  What's your top five?  Kenny Hennigan, I can't even add it because my favorites don't want it.  See, I want to add that one, too.  I got it.  It's online.  I fucked up with Ruby Tuesday.  This is Chris.  Then I go, I go, um, memory motel.  Wow.  Dead Flowers.  Dead Flowers, Wild Horses.  I know it's kind of gay.  And I'm going to throw one from the 90s era. 
[01:32:30]  Can You Hit Me Knockin' is a, I'm sorry, You Got Me Rockin' is a fucking great Stone  song, even though it's later.  Voodoo Lounge.  I'm telling you.  It's got some great tunes on it.  Now, do you like the Wild Horses, hold on.  Do you like the Wild Horses, the Stones version, or do you prefer the Susan Boyle version?  You fucking asshole.  You can even, you, no one listening has any idea how close that came to fucking being spit  out on.  You were so close to laughing through your own.  I really was.  That was wonderful to watch.  I was blanking on Susan Boyle's name.  Were you?  Yes, I was.  I thought you just thought it was, it was funny enough that I thought you were just laughing 
[01:33:00]  at what you were saying.  No, I was blanking on her name.  I just kept picturing her giant fucking gargoyle head.  So, as you, what is that cunt's name?  Nothing's better than that as a comic, that as you're speaking, you realize, I have to be a  I have no fucking door to exit this.  None.  And then at the last second.  And I'm running fast.  The door appears.  It appears.  What about the top five worst Stones songs?  Top five Beatles songs?  We had the Beatles.  I know.  People are liking Jimmy's list.  I have a Beatles list that people are probably going to know.  I don't know if Jimmy wins. 
[01:33:30]  Fuck that.  Jimmy's list sucks.  My list fucking, my list is almost applause worthy.  Hey, you want another top?  As tears go by?  Fucking fantastic.  Watch it on Sullivan.  They're so well dressed.  Rolling Stones.  Look at Norm Macdonald, Ernie and Astus.  Lifetime Achievement Award for Ernie.  Yeah, Lifetime Achievement Award.  I was on the phone with this guy named Victor, who used to fly airplanes for cargo.  Well, it's pretty strange, you know. 
[01:34:00]  They give you a pilot's license and say, no matter what you do, make sure there's never people on your plane.  Only fly mail and wheat.  And then he switched over to truck driver there.  And as Jimmy said, rickshaw and other horrible, horrible jobs.  You know, because the guy moves things from point A to point B.  He was, by the way, a regional airline pilot, which meant he flew people, but he probably flew Embraers or Canadian regional jets.  The puddle jumpers.  Yeah, which means that he was just not good enough a pilot to fly the big planes. 
[01:34:30]  He was flying the little planes.  Yeah.  Fifty seats and below.  Like on Sun West.  Exactly.  Fucking cold in air.  I hope someone that's listening to this knows Victor and works with him and can tell him he's an insufferable cunt when he comes to work.  He really is.  Well.  Fuck you, Victor.  It's time people stop hiding behind their fucking bullshit.  I'm not going to tell you where I work.  I'm not going to tell you my name.  Fucking assholes.  Exactly.  They're a bunch of anonymous fucking pussies. 
[01:35:00]  They're calling Jimmy the list-making kid.  I've always been known as the list-making kid.  And I had Jimmy Shelter on my list because someone was saying no one had Jimmy Shelter.  You had Jimmy Shelter, too, right?  No.  What's wrong with you?  Can't you hear me not?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  You want to hear another top five comedian list?  I'd love to.  You would?  Oh, River Rat.  River Rat knows how to do Twitter the right way.  I'll make my top five comics right now.  River Rat, Doc, what's up, brother?  That's a very tough one.  I'm going to make my top five lists. 
[01:35:30]  Well, my top five lists.  What would your top five list be?  I can't tell you yet.  You've got to make your top five lists.  I know one of Jimmy's.  What's your real name, River Rat?  River Rat's cool.  I follow him on Twitter, actually.  But what's your name?  Yeah, what is your real name?  I don't even know.  My first name is David.  Hi, Dave.  We call him Deacon.  What's your top five comedians?  All right.  Jimmy Norton.  Yay!  Pudding. 
[01:36:00]  Jay Moore.  I like Jay Moore.  I like turtles.  I like Jay.  I like Colin Cain.  All right.  I like Nick DiPaolo.  And I like Louis Black.  All right.  Wait.  Colin Cain, Nick DiPaolo, Louis Black, Jay Moore.  That's a nice list.  And Norton.  And Norton.  It sounds like the virus tour.  And Norton.  None of those guys are on my list.  None of them, right?  None of them.  Yeah, me neither.  Me neither.  What about what?  You're missing some biggies there.  You're missing either a George Carlin or a Richard Pryor.  You're missing my... 
[01:36:30]  I'm having trouble finding my fifth.  Okay, they're funny, but I mean, I don't like following the crowd and saying, okay, well,  just because they're that popular.  No, George Carlin was brilliant.  Whoever you want.  Yeah.  I just got to...  Look, I went with Ruby Tuesday.  Gay.  That's pretty bad.  Jay something?  Yeah.  Real quick is that, you know, earlier he was talking about how he was really getting  beat up by all the negative shit that people were saying to him.  And I just wanted to remind him that, you know, Jay, artists write from a place of vulnerability. 
[01:37:00]  I mean, I hate using that big word, but it's a place that basically non-writers, critics,  reviewers, they don't even understand it.  They can't even comprehend it.  And the ugly act...  Sorry.  I know you're making a point, but someone has the top five worst baby names.  Okay.  But here, River Rat, here's the thing.  As a performer, we're already coming from a place of vulnerability.  That's why we're in the business. 
[01:37:30]  We know we suck.  That's right.  That's why we got to go on stage and get people's attention.  So when fucking guys like, you know, Camaro85 decides to tell you, like, you fucking look  like you're losing your hair in hereafter, it's like, that's real...  You have a fucking laptop to tell me that?  Instead of looking up fucking what Harry Truman's favorite beverage was?  What's your...  I know what Hoover's was.  Come.  He loved when Clive Tolson would give him a...  I was fucking looking at Jimmy White, I'd like, go on. 
[01:38:00]  Go on.  Nothing.  I loved when Clive would give him a good fucking...  Who's Clive?  Clive Tolson is number two in fucking...  What do you...  In command behind the FBI.  That was Clive Owen, I could mastermind.  Clive Tolson, yeah.  Would he mix the cum with anything?  Like cum fribles or anything?  Nope, he'd actually...  I believe he'd pinch Edgar's nose and give him a fucking...  A nice mouthful.  Jimmy, you're incorrigible.  Of Clive...  Clive Tolson cum.  River Rat, it's a pleasure, bro.  He wanted some Melvin Purvis cum.  These were all FBI G-men.  Long story. 
[01:38:30]  Does G stand for cum?  Yeah, it stands for goody.  Because that's what he would say when he got cum.  Oh, goody.  Brian in Philly.  Brian?  Yes?  What's up, Brian?  Seize him.  Here's the top five...  Sorry, I talked over it.  Top five worst baby names.  I've got Victor on the list, but he's not number one.  I've got Adolph number one.  Adolph?  Too hacky.  Yeah, that is kind of hacky.  But, you know...  It's his list, though.  Ruby Tuesday was a little hack.  I'm the hateful list guy, remember?  Yeah.  We got Irving on that list. 
[01:39:00]  Are you ever going to see a baby named Little Irving or something like that?  Uh, yeah.  You know, I fucking went to Julius Irving like an idiot.  That would be...  Did you?  Dr. J.  He goes, did you?  Atta boy.  I have Victor on my list.  I have Victor on my list.  It's right between Shark Tomatoes and Cunt Warts.  Victor comes between those two.  So what else you got?  Uh, I had some hacky stuff.  I was trying to think of 1920s, uh, names and, uh, just didn't come up with a ton of them. 
[01:39:30]  So you don't have a top five?  Gertrude, Ethel?  I've got, you know, I've got...  Well, you know what?  If you're going with old school woman themes, Ethel's a great one.  Sure.  All right.  I think you're...  You ran a ground, bro.  Yeah.  You've got to stay in the deep part of the bay.  We should take a break.  Yeah, then we'll do comics and Beatle.  I didn't do my Beatles list.  I'm very wounded.  Comics is rough.  I'm having a hard time with my fifth, too.  I figured my fifth...  It was a couple of very close ones.  I have Colin on my list.  Colin's on my list, too. 
[01:40:00]  Colin's a genius, man.  He's a genius.  He's a great article in the paper on Colin today.  Colin said Dennis Miller came up to me and said,  Quinn, man, you're fantastic.  There's just something missing, and I can't put my finger on it.  And Quinn goes, and he was right!  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  I got Carlin, Pryor, Colin, and Dennis Miller before he went batshit.  Wow.  I have Pryor, Carlin, Woody, because as a stand-up, Woody's one of my favorites.  Colin.  And my last one, it was hard because I love Louie, but I put Tell. 
[01:40:30]  David Tell's one of my favorite stand-ups.  Otto, actually, believe it or not, Otto was in my fucking...  He's in my top ten.  Otto makes me laugh harder than fucking most human beings.  Otto's coming in this week.  Otto and George on Twitter, by the way.  I'm trying to get him followers.  But Attell is my fucking...  I think we did pretty good this weekend getting him followers.  Wow.  Carlin, Pryor, Quinn, Miller, Attell.  That's a good list.  I haven't seen choreography that stiff since the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.  A guy that owns the local titty bars here, he's got a handgun.  Should we let him in?  Yeah.  Let him.  Who the fuck were they turning away? 
[01:41:00]  God, he was funny.  Yes, he was.  And then he went fucking batshit.  Now he's Bill O'Reilly's correspondent.  Yeah, he's a little change of heart.  You know, I tell you, Bill, this guy's so far left, he makes Chica Cha seem like fresh  cut, got a geek kook.  It makes sense, though.  Like, are you fucking words anymore?  You gotta look up his jokes.  That's never fun, ever, right?  All right, we're gonna continue with Jay Moore, who's gonna be at Foxwoods this Friday  night.  Yeah!  Let's fill that fucker!  James P. Norton will be at the Columbus Funny Bone, right? 
[01:41:30]  Yes, and also, anti-social network dates are on sale for Washington, D.C. and Chicago,  where the opening night of the Comedy Festival and the Chicago Festival in June.  How much are tickets for that?  They're very cheap, actually.  I think 65 is the max.  It's me, Jim, Dave, and Bill.  It's his favorite nations, obviously.  Yes.  But you, who is it?  You, Dave, me, Brewer, Jim Brewer, David Tell.  You could have had Burr come in for less.  No, Bill's a big part of the draw, man.  I would love to leave.  What?  I'd love to get Bill for fucking less, and we could all split it, but no, Bill's a big 
[01:42:00]  part of that draw.  Between you, Brewer, and Attell?  It really is a fucking four equal parts.  I'm not being PC by saying that.  It's like you can hear the applause for each person.  It's a great show, and he's right.  Everyone just kills it.  Everyone loves fucking Burr, dude.  There's got to be someone out of that four you could have fucking tricked and cut their  20% between those.  Fuck, no.  I would love to.  I would love to slice a little off the top.  Maybe fucking tell Brewer that, you know, yeah, this is what it is, but Brewer would  fall for that shit. 
[01:42:30]  Guy's been around for way too long.  It is funny.  Guys like you and me, and all the guys you just mentioned, and you and me and Brewer  and Attell, we are on to them.  Yeah, man.  The fucking Nichols, they'll say to you, plus we take out $3,000 for advertising.  No, you don't.  Not out of my fucking check.  Fuck you.  Show me the receipt.  Because last time I checked, when I did Columbus Radio in the morning, that sold all the tickets.  Right.  Not your fucking ad in the free Columbus Recycler, you douchebag.  That's absolutely right, man.  They pull that shit.  And if you're taking it out of my check, I guarantee you're writing it off as a business 
[01:43:00]  expense when you do your taxes, so you're writing it off twice, which is a fucking felony,  you asshole.  Nice.  All right, $1,000.  No, not $1,000.  Zero.  See, I don't have that, and club owners are all horrendous.  Kenny catches them all the time.  Kenny, you can't fuck with Kenny.  He's OCD.  He catches everything.  But the theaters will try that shit.  You got to stay on them, man.  They all want to nickel and dime you.  I can't fill them.  I can't either.  That's the problem with the fucking settlement.  Believe me, if they were filled, we'd have no issues.  Oh, you hit bonus. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, LOL.  That's not it.  I did a theater in Spokane.  It was a 2,400-seat theater.  I sold 550 tickets, and I looked at the guy, and I go, well, I guess I won't be back.  He goes, oh, no.  But him saying it made me so happy.  He was honest.  Because when I play the Orleans in Vegas, it's full, and then they go, yeah, ticket sales  were a little upside down.  I'm like, I was there.  Yeah, right.  Well, we had to paper the room.  Well, then fucking tell me that backstage instead of telling me how great everything is  all weekend, you fuckers. 
[01:44:00]  We have fucking, you have to do...  Enjoy Rage in the Cage next weekend.  You have to have fucking control over comps, because otherwise they'll just paper the room  and get the drink money.  So don't let them...  I was in control over the comps.  And you stand up there like, wow, I'm a fucking big shot.  Look at all these people.  You don't realize that 800 people are in the casino being like, here, come to the show.  Somebody told me I'd come down with a case of big shot-itis.  Who said that?  Oh, Jimmy.  You of all people.  You are no big shot-itis person.  Yeah, we split the money four ways.  Me, Bill, Dave, and Jim.  We went to play games four ways.  Guess where Colin was last night? 
[01:44:30]  I don't know.  Hopefully in the hospital.  With chest bags.  Yeah.  Hopefully there's a cluster of cells somewhere.  He hit a 9-15 spot at the cellar, which I thought was interesting, because his HBO special  was Saturday.  But I remember a couple years ago, young Jimmy Norton had a HBO special.  Yes.  And Colin came on the radio and said, you think of yourself such a man of the people.  You've got to go be a gym rat.  And you've got to go do all your stupid material, work out all your new stuff.  And somebody's doing the exact same thing.  Did that fucking fraud say that and then do the same thing? 
[01:45:00]  Well, I don't know.  And he took my spot, because I was supposed to be there last night, but I was sick, so  I canceled that fucking spot taker.  So we'll get him on the phone after the break.  Well, you know, if fucking Jay and Jim want to just sit there and take...  Big article in the paper today, too.  I know.  We don't like that broad, but she...  Linda Stassi?  Giving thumbs up to Colin.  I hate her.  I love Linda Stassi.  She's been nothing but fair and impartial for me, my two.  I don't even know what she is.  Oh, she's horrendous.  With that, we're going to break.  Jay Moore, Jim Norton.  You're horrendous.  Danny and Billy Hayes. 
[01:45:30]  That's right.  What are we doing next?  Beatles, U2.  How about Charlie Sheen?  Let's all make love.  I got a big AA problem with Charlie Sheen.  All right, we'll mix it up.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  This is the OPN3 Show on the Virus Series XM.  Recently on the Ron and Fez Show.  Who's the head of the interns right now?  Who's the general?  Gabe is the general.  Send Gabe in to me, would you please?  Guess what, Gabe?  What happened?  You fucked up and you fucked up from the last time. 
[01:46:00]  Tomorrow, Friday, is your last day.  You just can't fucking keep going on like this.  I tried to fucking train you like a fucking intern ninja and you keep fucking it up.  Ron and Fez, next at 11 a.m. Eastern on the Virus.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:46:30]  By the way, we're hoping Anthony calls us from his satellite phone.  You know, I've been thinking about Anthony's vacation.  Yeah.  He really let us know what a fucking guinea piece of garbage he is.  Why?  Because he's a fucking multimillionaire and he's on a fucking cruise with fat people from Wisconsin.  Did you see the setup he's got?  It's a fucking boat.  He tweeted the pictures over the weekend.  He's on a fucking boat like the guineas before him.  He's got a nice suite. 
[01:47:00]  He doesn't even have to deal with anybody if he doesn't want to.  Without papers.  He had to board at Ellis Island.  He really is a fucking guinea, white, tragic, uncircumcised, filthy jerk.  He really is.  He could have been someplace that looks like a Corona commercial.  With his fucking feet up.  You know, you go to a place where it's like a private island.  Right.  Well, he's on a fucking cruise where they're like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  With his mom, too.  Hot, hot, hot.  You're right.  And he's doing two weeks.  That's right.  The suite looks good.  What a fucking stupid idiot.  Hope they dock in Port-au-Prince. 
[01:47:30]  Fucking.  He is shit.  What a fucking guinea.  That is the fucking most Italian shit I've ever heard.  Has he been out of touch for a while?  Have you talked to him, Danny?  Well, he hasn't tweeted in a while.  So I guess you can't get service wherever he is.  I know this might come as a shock to everybody on the earth, but no, I haven't heard anything from him.  All right, well.  We'd be in a fucking right away, getting fucking fresh.  Yeah.  We're hoping.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  What do you think of that, asshole?  Well, someone get the word out there. 
[01:48:00]  We want a fucking button.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  We want a satellite fucking phone call from Anthony this week.  That would be very, very good.  See what he's up to.  Did he text you?  You sure?  Email?  He didn't text you?  No, I wasn't.  You're supposed to be best friends with him.  That's what everyone thinks.  Yeah, well, yeah, I got to.  Everyone thinks that.  I got to mow his lawn and stuff, you know.  Everyone thinks that.  All right, what are we doing?  Charlie Sheen?  So, word went around on Saturday night that Charlie Sheen bombed horribly in Detroit,  and the video that's online here and there.  Pooed off stage. 
[01:48:30]  It's horrible.  Somebody chanted, okay, I'm scared straight.  Right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great one.  Hey, who's the comedian in open forum?  I didn't know.  Why wouldn't you get a name?  Look, the guy might be.  I would have done it.  I would have, any comedian would have.  I would have, too.  Yeah, he should have got a veteran road comic that can handle a crazy room.  That would have helped him for 20 of the minutes.  He sat down in a chair and was just doing Q&A and stuff.  Where do you think?  There's no, all right, I don't know if you've, have you seen the dates, his schedule? 
[01:49:00]  I have not.  It's one that you and I would look at and go, wow, my fucking April is batshit.  I really have to get my shit together for April.  Yeah.  Like, it's 22 dates in the month of April.  22 dates?  Yeah, but there's only like a day between each one.  Some are back to back.  Like, there's no way he's fucking coming out of Florida.  What a dope.  Well, the tour's in trouble because the ticket brokers bought all the tickets and they can't  sell these fucking things.  Oh, you said that Friday.  Oh, there they go. 
[01:49:30]  Talking about Friday again, Victor, you fucking douchebag.  Here's the thing, though.  Chicago was full.  It was sold out.  That wasn't all ticket.  Like, it was a full fucking place.  All right, then somebody's lying.  Detroit or Chicago?  Both.  Okay.  There was no empty seats.  And someone's lying.  Can we see his...  Maybe they're papering the room.  Is there any Radio City Music Hall for Friday?  Is it this Friday?  I think so.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's not in Columbus.  I think.  And then he comes back and does it again.  Is that what's happening?  Fuck.  He's doing two Radio City's.  That's the best line my wife ever had.  I go, Charlie Sheen at Radio City. 
[01:50:00]  That is so sad.  She goes, no.  The Rockettes are much more sad.  They've got to tell those stupid stories.  We're all really not the same height, but it looks that way.  Because he's down.  The Rockettes are much more sad.  I got audio of his Charlie.  Charlie, yeah.  But I also have the news reports.  What do you want to hear?  He's doing...  Fucking Opie's the first word of the show.  You do it.  Wait.  Cleveland.  Columbus.  He's doing Radio City.  But look at the time between. 
[01:50:30]  It's like back, back, back, back.  Fourth, the fourth.  Oh, wait.  He knows this is a quick burn.  He's got to go there.  Five, six, eight, nine, ten.  He's handing that off.  Twelve.  You think he's going to do all these shows?  No.  Yes.  No?  He's going to start canceling this shit.  I say 80%.  You know what?  Because he's the kind of guy that will go, tell Toronto we can't make it, man.  We're winning in Tampa, man.  We can't get to St. Petersburg.  Duh.  Winning.  There's no way he's going to do all these shows.  It really is horrendous.  All the people.  You've been on the road.  People offer you fucking coke and shit.  I was at a club a month ago. 
[01:51:00]  And the guy goes, can I get you something to drink?  Smoke?  Snort?  And I was like, did you just fucking say that to me?  You don't know me.  Wow.  He's got a lot of fucking...  There's no way...  You and I, who do it constantly, you do it more than I do even, that's a fucking full-ass  plate.  That's a very busy, especially because you're doing real theaters, there's no bullshit gigs.  They're all fucking 5,000 plus seats.  You think he's going to have a bunch of temptations?  Yeah, but also the gigs, if you have a couple bad shows, as a fucking seasoned comic, I can 
[01:51:30]  have a bad show or a show.  With him, it's like they're only there to see what happens in the freak show aspect of  it.  So he's up against a fucking rough one, man.  I like how he told the people of Detroit, I already have your money.  Right.  And then 10 minutes later said, look, you guys work hard for a living, he tried to fucking  switch kids.  Oh, did he really?  He tried to chill them out, because they just started booing him.  And then one of the reviews said, the biggest bad boy in Hollywood apparently came undone  by a group of grown-ups talking at the same time.  Fuck.  Yeah, but he shouldn't have been in that position. 
[01:52:00]  It's like, they're dumb for buying the tickets.  What do you think you're going to see?  He's not a comic.  Well, let's play a clip.  Oh, by the way, Live Nation, who put this together, that's who also put together me at Foxwoods  Friday.  I'm going to be at Foxwoods Friday.  There you go, Jim Moore, Foxwoods Friday.  Dude, they're also the Anti-Social Network Tour.  Is that so?  Brain children.  And they did our virus tour.  Yeah, Live Nation is the only show in town.  You doing that again?  Someday.  Taking a couple of...  I would love to do it again.  I love those shows, man.  Maybe next summer we'll fucking put it back together.  Who on the... 
[01:52:30]  Jimmy's going out with this thing, so let Jimmy go out with this thing, and then after  that we do my thing.  Our thing.  Our thing.  Who on the virus tour fucking ate it so bad that maybe they had to be jettisoned?  Anyone?  Oh, fuck.  Dom.  Dom Morero only did one show, and Jimmy Schubert in Philly got booed.  Jimmy Schubert.  Can I tell the truth?  But it wasn't their fault.  Dom's like a laconic, very, like, telling stories.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Dom certainly shouldn't bomb.  I love Dom.  He shouldn't bomb.  He's a veteran. 
[01:53:00]  He knows how to do these shows, but he ate it.  The best, though, is Jimmy Schubert.  Can I tell the Jimmy Schubert story?  It wasn't Jimmy Schubert's fault.  It was Philly, his hometown, and he had his family in the front row as he ate it in front  of 15,000 people.  Oh, my God.  And we've had the...  Me and Jimmy drove back to Philly going, what do you think that conversation was all about  the next day when they went for breakfast?  I thought they did pretty good.  Jimmy had to know.  How did he bomb, though?  He didn't bomb.  They booed him unfairly. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, what makes it funny is he never really had a chance.  Yeah.  He just didn't have a chance.  It wasn't like, oh, his jokes suck.  He just went up there and they were just being dicks because they didn't know.  Because what happened with the virus tour, if the fans didn't hear the comic on the show  before, they were not interested in general, right?  Is that fair to say?  A lot of times.  Schubert barely did our show.  Dom maybe did one phoner.  I don't know.  Two phoners, maybe.  So they booed any guy they weren't familiar with as far as the show goes. 
[01:54:00]  Here's Charlie Sheen in Detroit.  I figured Detroit was a good money to tell some crack stories.  Somebody will fuck you.  Show of hands.  Show of hands.  Who here has tried crack?  All right, forget that.  Who's building crack?  It's a liar.  I don't do crack at you, Mark, but I'm just saying.  I'm just saying tonight if I said, you know, it's good to fuck you, just crack. 
[01:54:30]  I think I'm in the right city.  Why are they booing that?  Because he's just sitting up there.  He's obviously not focused or has anything planned.  Perfect.  He doesn't have anything planned.  It's kind of like our old road shows back in the day  when we just went up on stage and made shit up.  That's what he's doing.  Unlike today, which we have a nice fucking... 
[01:55:00]  Those people in Detroit deserved what they got.  Because, again, they're not going to see a great show.  We don't know what's going to happen.  What do you think is going to happen?  You're saying every city, they deserve to have a shitty show?  Yes.  No, I'm not disagreeing.  Only because he's not a stage comic.  I think anyone with a brain buying a ticket for that show  is looking for a train wreck that they're sort of getting.  What if you're going for the irony?  Like, I want to go just to go...  That's different, then.  That's different. 
[01:55:30]  If you're just going because you like Charlie  and you want to hear him talk or whatever, that's one thing.  But then they boo him.  It's like, what did you think was going to happen?  If he's just doing what he's doing and you're enjoying it,  then have a great time.  Don't boo.  I think they thought he was going to go up and do his warlock shit,  but then when he turned on the fact that they were in Detroit,  and referring to it as like a shitty town,  they went, what the fuck, you asshole?  I also think they were annoyed by the material.  Like, he didn't have any real planned material.  Nothing planned.  Let's get a news report on.  It's from Fox 2 Detroit. 
[01:56:00]  The show's still going on, and people are walking out,  and they are saying this show was absolutely awful.  A guy just walked past and said, this show sucks.  And you know, you don't have to take my word for it.  Just listen to what some of the fans, or ex-fans,  said to me as they were walking out.  The guy who opened for him was absolutely horrible.  He got booted off the stage.  Charlie Sheen, thinking he was the president of Warlocks,  babbling on and on until I wanted to throw up in my seat.  Why'd you go? 
[01:56:30]  I sat around for an hour, didn't get to see nothing,  and he comes out, and I could have watched this on TV.  All right.  Good.  Why didn't you spend that much money to watch him in person  when he does something?  Me?  Well, I brought it online.  I paid $300 to be here.  He walked out.  Everybody's booing on.  They walked out.  There's more people smoking than there is in there.  In the theater.  I texted my husband and said, grab her coat,  and we'll meet you at the front door.  It was not entertaining, and I like him.  Good.  Oh, good. 
[01:57:00]  Horrible.  Those dummies, what were they expecting?  Exactly.  All he was doing online is fucking saying,  Warlock, duh.  What did you expect him to do?  Have you seen his new stream stuff?  No, I've heard parts of it.  Oh, it's horrible.  You're watching a fucking crackhead.  Have him pull it up.  No, we've done it.  It's horrible.  You're just watching someone fucking coked out of their face.  How the fuck did he get a clean drug test?  You would go because it's a freak show.  Sure.  Of course, not because you think something great is going to happen.  Jimmy and I and Billy are around a lot of addicts.  Yeah.  If you watch five seconds of that, you go, well, this person needs to be driven to a fucking meeting. 
[01:57:30]  He reminded me of somebody, even if he was sober, who's been up for three days.  Like, you know that fucking weird loopy shit you get when you're not sleeping?  He reminded me of somebody in a weird headspace that might not necessarily be high,  but was still in a fucking very, very weird headspace.  So, wait.  I offered nothing right there, by the way.  No, I'm with Jimmy.  I think he was more manic.  I didn't think he was actually under the influence.  You're saying...  If you pull up the webcast where he's wearing a Yankee shirt and he takes a conference call  and he's just, he's smoking through his nose and he's like peeking out behind his shirt. 
[01:58:00]  He pulls his shirt down and he goes, duh.  But he's just trying too hard there.  Was he acting there?  He's coked...  I thought he was acting and trying to be over the top.  This is what people are kind of digging, so I'm going to just play it out.  You're saying he had to be coked out.  I'm not...  You know, you never want to say that.  You can just offer an opinion, though.  If it's an opinion, it's fair.  He looked to me like somebody that was...  This guy.  That one.  That one.  I thought he was...  Play that.  Can you play audio on that?  I thought he was over the top acting.  Listen to this.  This is a freaking, you know, built by trolls.  Keep that in mind.  Phones were built by trolls.  Hold on. 
[01:58:30]  He's going to put something in his speakerphone now.  Yeah, I saw this.  Look at his face.  But it looks like he's been up for a long time, like Jimmy's saying.  Hold on.  Let me turn the volume.  He's trying too hard here.  I think so, too.  But he's alone.  It's not like they set up his webcast.  He goes, I'm going to set up the camera and really hit the...  No, but he knows that people expect it.  He keeps trying to top himself and be more interesting the next time.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  Okay, I can hear you, too.  What's going on, man?  Okay, the first thing.  I'm getting ready to do the tweet to Meredith.  Okay. 
[01:59:00]  Come on, Jimmy.  That's not fucking up all night movement.  I really think that that's...  Is it really Meredith?  I'm just...  I forwarded you exactly how she spelled it.  If she doesn't know how to spell her own name, then she loses.  Oops.  Bye-bye.  Oh, yuck.  It's embarrassing.  We love you, Meredith.  It's embarrassing.  He's trying to be the quirky, crazy...  He thinks he's fucking Peter Finch in Network.  What are you, in Italyville?  Italyville.  Are you in Italyville still?  Someone switched out his brain with that of a cunty 12-year-old girl. 
[01:59:30]  They do.  That's exactly what it is.  A cunty 12-year-old girl.  Here's my problem with his whole thing.  First of all, no one has a better gig than $1.7 million to do...  I mean, that's a six-hour-a-day job.  You did the sitcom thing.  Yeah, it's the easiest job, and it rains the most amount of money in the world.  And they treat him probably pretty good there on the fucking set.  You're going to starve the biggest show on TV.  Whatever you need, Charlie.  But my problem is when he's doing his interviews, and he goes, 
[02:00:00]  AA's for losers and trolls.  He's got a 5% success rate.  Now, everyone in this room and everybody listening to this show  knows someone whose life was saved by Alcoholics Anonymous.  Now, how do you get a 5% success rate by an organization where the second A stands for anonymous?  They don't put out quarterly fucking spreadsheets and go,  here's who came in, and here's who left, and here's who it didn't work on.  And that really fucking bothered the shit out of me  that he attacked AA so vociferously, to quote Clyde Frazier. 
[02:00:30]  I didn't care about it either way.  His opinions on AA were absolutely irrelevant to me.  Because, again, he's a guy who's in denial.  And when a guy's in denial, he's like a little girl just saying.  But how could it be irrelevant to you knowing that someone  who is arguing with his family about going to AA,  like someone out in the world going like,  I don't want to go to AA, and then he listens to this shit and goes,  see, I don't have to go.  I think that anybody who would make a decision on going to meetings  or anything for their own recovery based on what dumb Charlie Sheen says... 
[02:01:00]  Or people that would buy tickets to his show.  Possibly.  But that's 3,000 people.  But I figure they have a higher power, too, and they'll get there sooner or later.  And I'm not just trying to give the right answer.  I really believe that.  I think there's so much information about recovery,  and there's so many people who are sober through different ways,  that him saying that, he's not coming from a healthy place.  No one looks at him and goes, wow, he's doing really great.  Let's listen to what he says.  And I don't know if he's right about the success rate.  I think the success rate is relatively low, which is by no fault of any program, 
[02:01:30]  and it's because the odds are you're going to die if you're an addict.  Would you put a number on it?  He says 5%.  I had literally many, many years ago from a person heard, say, 8%.  And then I heard somebody say if, let's just say certain meetings were held for people who need them  and not people who want them to be held in Yankee Stadium.  The majority of people who are active die.  And it's an unfortunate fact.  But the success rate for people that continue to go is close to 100%.  Keep coming back. 
[02:02:00]  It works if you work it.  If you don't go, it don't work.  I think a lot of people try to get sober and don't.  And they said that if you look at when they have cakes and anniversaries,  and I'm careful, I don't specifically say any particular group just because they request that you don't.  But they say you see that between 5 and 10 years, there's a lot less candles, meaning a lot less people.  A lot of people go and get clean and sober for 5 years, however they do it, and then life gets good.  But they don't do enough internal work.  Beware of celebration.  And they fucking hit a wall. 
[02:02:30]  I'm like, is this it?  Is this it?  I'm okay.  Beware of celebration, really.  You have to be careful.  No, I like that.  No, that's the first time I've heard that.  So after 5 years, it starts to...  I find that there's a lot of people who will make it for 5, and then between 5 and 10, it's tough because you hit a certain type of wall.  What if you make it to 10?  I would have thought it would have been...  Sure, but I mean, not easier, but I mean...  Well, sure, I think it's your lifestyle at that point.  But I think it's your lifestyle earlier than that.  I'm surprised by that number.  I could be wrong, too.  I heard that many years ago.  We're just talking...  Just us girls. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  I would have thought that after your fucking pink cloud goes away, and then maybe 8 months of actual work, then you go...  I'm fucked.  I would think the number of people bailing would be way lower than 5 years.  It would be like a year and a half.  Oh, you're probably right.  Like, oh, I got this.  No, you don't, asshole.  I think...  Well, a lot of people, I think, probably try to get sober and do it for the first year or two.  What do you think, Billy?  Can you go to more meetings than all of us?  Yes, sir.  I was just saying between 5 and 10 is when most people go out. 
[02:03:30]  That was a surprising place.  When would you say in AA or a program, would you guess, year or month-wise, most people say, I got this, and go back out?  One year.  Yeah?  Yeah.  One year.  Why?  One year.  Because they got the celebration in, and now they figure they got it conquered.  But half measures avail us nothing.  After a year...  What did you say?  Half measures availed us nothing.  After a year, people, I think, also think, like, all right, and if they haven't done enough work, they're like, is this it? 
[02:04:00]  Whatever.  I got this, and there's no growth, and it just gets boring because you're not doing anything new.  You're just...  When you first get sober, you're on a...  You know, we didn't get into the rooms because we were on top of the world, you know?  And when you get in there, you have nothing going for you.  I remember when I was about 30 days sober, a gentleman said to me in Santa Monica, he said to me,  we were talking about relationships, and he says, you know why you don't get into relationships? 
[02:04:30]  And I said, no, I don't.  And he said, because you have absolutely nothing to offer anyone.  And that made sense.  Yeah.  It made sense that day.  And we have nothing going for us at that moment.  So as time goes on, we start to get things in our life.  We start filling the voids, and we start looking for those hobbies and other things to do.  And the next thing you know, you have your job.  Feeling good about ourselves.  You're feeling good about yourself.  You have a job now.  Now you're making money again, and you're doing the right thing, and everything's starting to go in your direction. 
[02:05:00]  And then all of a sudden, you're saying to yourself, look at this.  I got this stuff beat.  I got beat.  I'm obviously well.  That's what you're saying, right?  Absolutely.  Here's the thing with me, with Charlie Sheen saying AA has a 5% success rate.  There's no data on AA, because the second A stands for anonymous.  He broke Chuck Lorre's anonymity.  Did he?  When he gave his thing, he goes, here's a word you love, Chuck, acceptance.  And he opened up, he goes, page 44.  I know you know this page, Chuck. 
[02:05:30]  He broke, like, three people's anonymity in his stupid fucking interviews, his blathering idiot interviews.  He said it has a 5% success rate.  Charlie Sheen's father, Martin Sheen, by the grace of God, is sober because of a program called Alcoholics Anonymous.  Charlie Sheen is a fucking crackhead because he quit Alcoholics Anonymous.  That's 50 fucking percent in your own house.  How the fuck do you whittle that down to 5?  But like anything else, logic, what do they say?  Obsession is a thought over which logic has no power. 
[02:06:00]  It's like, to be logical.  I don't know.  I've heard that, though, but it's true.  Logic doesn't work with that.  Logically, sure.  It's 50% in his home.  But nobody, nobody, someone once said.  Can you just say, that's a very good point, Jay.  No, it is a good point, but it's all.  Somebody once said, if I eat broccoli, and it did to me what alcohol did,  I would never eat broccoli again.  If it made me throw up, or it made me drunk drive, or it made me fucking hit my spouse.  Maybe get a bunch of pussy for a while.  Yeah, maybe fucking, yeah.  That did help me get laid a little bit.  How you doing, girls?  Beautiful girls. 
[02:06:30]  It's not rational.  It's irrational.  All right, we got another clip from, uh...  Yay, clips.  ABC 7 in Detroit.  Detroit.  It takes connection.  Perfect still.  A lot of people giving the thumbs down, losing even.  There's still a crowd out here outside the Fox Theater,  and frankly, people say it's not what they expected.  What were they expecting?  I gotta stop the clip.  Exactly.  I would go, because it's, like I said, a train wreck.  Let's see this idiot.  I wouldn't go to look at a polished show. 
[02:07:00]  He's got no show.  Ten minutes into the show, and dozens of Charlie Sheen fans  were looking for the nearest exit and a refund.  It was nothing like we expected it to be.  It was really boring.  He's definitely not winning.  He's losing.  The losing reaction to the violent torpedo, a truth show,  was far different from earlier in the day  when crowds staked out the Townsend Hotel in Birmingham  just to get a glimpse of the star and his goddesses.  He mentioned Morlock and Tiger Blood winning. 
[02:07:30]  That's about it.  His three catchphrases.  Laura Davis and her husband drove down from Garden City  hoping for a wild and crazy time.  What it turned out to me was just really dull.  Nothing but film clips to take up most of the time.  She says his goddesses opened the sold-out show.  Sheen even wore a Tiger's jersey with Warlock written on the back  to get the crowd going.  But the momentum died out, and so did the show, says Jeff Davis.  Fall asleep, wake up, see what everybody's yelling about,  fall back asleep. 
[02:08:00]  Do you want to go?  Can we leave?  Can we leave?  With so many awful reviews right out the gate,  this tour has started off losing, not winning.  Heard it was better in Chicago, in all fairness, but...  I heard that too, but...  You know, in his mind, like Jimmy and I know,  the set list, it's like, there's bullet...  Sorry, I got a mouthful of food.  Somebody say something really chill.  Jay's going to be at Foxwood Friday night.  Yeah, you do have a set list.  I'm not sure if you're saying that he thought... 
[02:08:30]  Like, his was probably a little looser.  He didn't have...  Jimmy and mine set list...  Like, my set list will be the...  Like, I'll write down the word kayak.  Right.  And it'll be an entire story about me and my son renting a kayak,  which will lead into a story about my son being a fucking moron one night  and doing stupid shit, and then waking him up the next morning.  Like, it's a 15...  Right.  It's a word that is eight minutes long.  Right.  But, you know, Charlie Sheen's fucking set list was like,  goddesses, like, they're going to go out and kiss.  And then, tiger's jersey. 
[02:09:00]  I'm not even kidding.  It's just very vague.  People in the audience...  What have we got here?  Fucking comedian.  No, you don't.  Well, that's why he said it that way.  Or his one word on the set list was just one word.  Like, it would be winning, but all he would just do is say,  winning.  Right.  And then it's on to the next one on the set list.  And realize that only took up three seconds.  That would be like doing kayak and just go,  all right, folks, kayak.  Yeah.  We're winning again.  So, winning.  Good. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, we're losing.  You're right.  Cunty, third-year-old, 12-year-old girl is exactly what it's like.  I'm just amazed that there's that many people that really thought  they were going to see a real show.  I'm just amazed by that.  I want people to...  I can't get past that.  I love that they feel ripped off.  Let's cut through all the bullshit from the three guys in this room.  Which night of Radio City are you going?  I would go knowing it's going to be a shitty show.  I think it's Friday.  When is the Radio City musical?  Then he comes back a day later.  He fucking sold that shit out twice, that fucker.  Because I might go to Foxwoods this weekend. 
[02:10:00]  I'm at Uncle Spongebob.  I'm at Uncle Spongebob.  He's fucking chuckle hut in the woods in Nashua, New Hampshire.  What the fuck is happening to me?  So, if we do Foxwoods Friday, then we've got to do the other show.  When are the Radio City music shows?  Friday.  Is it Friday?  It's your show.  I don't have it in front of me.  I don't know, but we'll figure it out.  I don't have it in front of me.  I don't know, but we'll figure it out.  Fucking per...  You have to be reading these right now.  No, I just figured it out.  Oh, you just figured it out finally?  Very good.  Any guests today?  No, it's us.  Maybe Ronnie B. 
[02:10:30]  He ain't making it.  He's not making it?  Sunday is the Radio City music hall show?  Friday.  Friday, Sunday.  Let's fucking go Sunday.  You want to go, Jimmy?  You back?  I would never waste three hours fucking watching that dreck.  Just to see the...  No, I really wouldn't.  Just to see how shitty it is.  Dude, I don't go to see fucking good shows.  I'm not going to waste my time watching that.  Let's get a big kiss.  Think of all the things you'll have to talk about when you come to the show. 
[02:11:00]  You know what?  You're not wrong, but...  But for the people that bought tickets, go with the feeling that you're going to see a shitty show,  and then you'll enjoy yourself way more.  Way more.  I'm on my way home in a fucking Embraer from Columbus on Sunday.  You ain't gone.  I'll be just grateful that I'm alive after flying a fucking...  Because I know that things are going well for me right now,  so I know I'm going to be killed in a fucking Embraer.  According to Twitter, I just know I'm going to be killed in an Embraer.  I know it.  What's Embraer?  What do you mean?  An Embraer.  It's a small plane.  What do you mean you just know that?  Because I'm saying, with my luck, I could see the story. 
[02:11:30]  Just when things were heating up.  Because Victor's flying.  Tonight's show, I would almost be worth dying if I knew he was dying a half second before me.  Jesus.  Your last thought is, oh, good.  Yeah.  Thank God he's dead.  I know I'm right there.  You really think you could...  Do you have thoughts that you could die in a plane crash?  I certainly do.  I fly enough where it could happen, but I don't fly that, you know.  Well, you fly more than I do, and I fly constantly. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I fly good airlines, though.  And I'm careful about the planes they're going to...  Did you know McDonald's?  Did you see his special?  I did not, no.  Fucking A.  I heard for years, like, he's got knots, he's closing with fucking songs, like he's  a fucking whack job.  It was fucking...  Everyone's talking about it.  Perfect.  Yeah.  Because everyone's always worried about dying on a plane, you know?  Because no one dies on a plane, you know, or a terrorist attack.  He goes, you know, my father died, my grandfather died.  I come from a long line of death. 
[02:12:30]  He goes, you know what will kill you is your heart.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  I think the percentage is 100% that when your heart stops, you die.  They go, hey, watch out for that guy, he's got a big heart.  Well, tell him to be careful.  I put in a Boston accent by accident.  That's all right.  Tell him to fucking be careful.  It works.  Goodness gracious.  Let's eat our sandwiches.  Yeah.  Enough on the Charlie Sheen.  So, go to the show, realize, and you're going to see a shitty show.  You'll really enjoy yourself.  All right, I'm doing the best I can at Foxwoods. 
[02:13:00]  You don't have to fucking do that disclaimer.  Good show at Foxwoods.  Great show in Columbus.  I went and saw Colin's show a couple times.  It really was fucking brilliant.  I loved Colin's show.  I'm trying to think of another show I've gone to recently.  Like, I'd go to see fucking Ozzy or Motorhead.  What's the hardest you've ever laughed at a comedy club?  For an hour.  Brian Regan.  I'm going to guess Otto.  Otto.  When Otto's killing it.  Me and Otto did a fucking gig years ago.  It was in fucking Pennsylvania for the Pickle Man. 
[02:13:30]  It was a pizzeria.  It was a pizzeria.  And you're standing up there, and there's the pizza tables to the right and left.  And there's a bar behind it.  And nobody saw me.  It was just they fell off the chair.  I physically fell off the bar stool.  And nobody, this is an expression, nobody was looking at me, so I wasn't play acting.  It's the hardest a guy's ever made me laugh in a room.  What was the joke that got you?  You remember?  The Pickle Man's girlfriend was fucking walking.  Wait, isn't this off Nebraska?  The Pickle Man's girlfriend in Philly last night? 
[02:14:00]  The Pickle Man's girlfriend was walking her, like, seven or eight-year-old kid up the aisle.  And Otto's on stage, and he just looked.  And it was so uncalled for.  He goes, ah, look at the kid.  Isn't he cute?  I'd like to grab his ankles and crack his skull on a fucking sink.  Jesus.  And I knew he got that from the end of Caligula.  And it made me laugh harder than anybody has ever made me laugh in a room.  What?  It got a, it might have gotten a one from, it got an 11 from me and a zero from the crowd. 
[02:14:30]  It was so brutal and uncalled for.  What did the woman do?  What could she do?  She said he wanted to kill her son by cracking his butt.  It was such a fucking visceral image.  She should have just turned around and walked out of the place.  Like how you would throw out a blanket?  I'd like to grab that kid's ankles and crack his skull on a fucking sink.  And the swing of a child into a sink is such an image.  But that's the Caligula.  People think because I called and said, I wrote that, that's mine. 
[02:15:00]  Like, people don't realize, like, it's all me and, all me and Billy do is fucking quote Otto all day.  Like, he's one of my all-time favorites.  He just doesn't want you doing it on TV shows.  Don't, remember that time you called tits, breasts?  That was mine too.  When's Otto coming in?  Tomorrow?  I think so.  Tomorrow is Otto and George.  David Tell, by the way, made me laugh.  Gave me one of those moments.  Yeah, what was it?  I mean an hour.  I'm trying, well, David always made me laugh.  I'm trying to think of, uh.  I tell the guy for 60 minutes, you cannot, like, you go, this is not good for me. 
[02:15:30]  Like, I might have to go to the hospital.  You know when you laugh so hard you gotta get out of the room?  Yeah.  Yeah.  David's made me laugh like that.  Brian Regan did it to me.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, Regan's fucking great, man.  He could give you a good solid hour.  Yeah.  I'm selling him the crease.  I'm trying to think of who's made me laugh for an hour.  It's a tough question.  I mean, all those guys have.  I have the weirdest answer.  I was at Caroline's.  Me and Mike DiNicola went up there, like, out of nowhere.  Just to say, like, fuck it, let's go see. 
[02:16:00]  Swear to God, 60 minutes, I almost fucking died for Kevin Meany.  Really?  60 minutes of fucking bedlam.  Like, an uncle that fucking tickles you to the point where you get scared, like, he's gotta stop.  Yeah.  Nothing creepy.  But, like, it was so fucking stupid combined with brilliant, combined with I know it's stupid,  I'm well aware of the fact I'm closing with We Are The World.  But it was so far from We Are The World that it became ironic and hilarious again. 
[02:16:30]  He's closing with fucking We Are The World.  That's why I was raising my hand.  I was wondering if the We Are The World wrecked it for you.  No.  It's fucking 50 times funnier now.  Because we've made fun of the fact that he still does We Are The World.  It's funnier now than it ever was.  And now it has come around again.  Because it's the fucking stu...  It's fucking...  You go, I can't believe this happened.  He's a funny motherfucker.  He never worked on our show, unfortunately.  I would love to have Kevin Meany on it.  Oh, I...  We...  And when he kept doing his Aunt Mary, like, oh, jeez, Kevin fell down and stuff.  He was doing his fucking...  I never saw him.  He was doing his character.  He was the real person. 
[02:17:00]  You know who else made me laugh?  A guy whose name you won't know, but I did Wildwood with when I first started for a week.  A guy named Doug White, who went on to get...  To just do something in Vegas.  He did crowd work, and he would always come out on a fucking little hobby horse.  Like a fucking...  What an asshole.  Like, you know, a stick with a fucking horse.  And he would put a cowboy hat on.  What an asshole.  And it was so idiotic, but he would just come out and, like, hop on stage with this little horsey.  What a fucking dick.  And just attack people in the audience.  He was great, and he made me laugh.  He was one of those guys that made me laugh for the entire show. 
[02:17:30]  Otto's the only guy that's made me laugh on, like, watching their tape.  He's the only guy that I've watched, like, their tape.  And had, like, when I was doing action and called people into my trailer and said, watch this.  And, like, there would be an audience of eight.  Like, there was, like, 14 showings of the Otto and George reel.  Yeah.  Like, are you Chinese, miss?  I hope your next shit is square.  Too good to talk to a puppet, huh?  Like, it was fucking bedlam.  Like, Buddy Hackett watching it going, this is the funniest thing. 
[02:18:00]  Like, Buddy Hackett weeping.  Yeah.  Yeah, Otto's...  Oh, fuck, he makes me laugh.  I would say, yeah, him above all.  Even though I've seen his act before, it still makes me laugh.  And if I see a line again, it doesn't matter.  I haven't seen him in a while, either.  He's bringing George in tomorrow, too.  He's going back to Otto and George.  You know what kills me?  He's done just the Otto thing lately on our show.  It's when he shits on someone in the audience, the fucking puppet looks over first.  Like, the puppet...  Like, if I'm looking at Opie, the puppet, like, as he's talking, the puppet will go... 
[02:18:30]  Do a double take of Jimmy, and then fucking Otto goes,  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I've never seen...  No, we've talked about this.  At N.E.W., when he came in, George would read the newspaper when we weren't in break.  Me and Bill...  You've seen it, right?  That was sick.  And I've always wanted to ask Otto.  Yeah, big deal.  I always wanted to ask Otto, and I'll ask him tomorrow,  Are you doing that to fucking mindfuck us, or is this what is happening in your brain?  We would look over.  Like, we're not even paying attention to him, and I go to Ant.  I remember, like, it was yesterday.  I go, Ant, Ant.  And I point to Otto, and there's George looking at the paper. 
[02:19:00]  And not Otto, by the way.  Me and Billy were in the room, sitting at the console,  and George is looking at the goddamn New York Post.  Otto's having a conversation with you.  Oh, you saw it.  I was there.  You elbow Ant, like, this is the craziest shit in the world.  And it has to be addressed, because it's fucking scary.  It's a fucking scary moment.  And then you actually go, now, George.  And the fucking puppet goes, yes, sir. 
[02:19:30]  The puppet looks up in the fucking newspaper, looks at it open, and goes, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  He lifts his head up and says, yes, sir.  Wait, you were there, too?  I was there for that.  I don't know if you guys were there.  Fuck.  But, like, what's funnier than, like, not what, not how.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  That's why we still do that with a yes, sir.  Like a Staten Island yes, sir.  To this day, we still use the yes, sir.  But break it down.  Is that Otto giving you a mind fuck?  Or is it the only way he, I don't fucking give me.  He makes me laugh hard as a guy. 
[02:20:00]  Like, we met girls together a couple times many, many years ago.  That's got to be weird.  It's one of my favorite moments in 21 years of stand-up.  I don't feel that.  It was me and him fucking fooling around with these two girls in a pool in Delaware years ago.  This is early 90s, mid-90s.  And fucking me and my girl, I'm fucking cock-grinding her.  And Otto and his chick are doing nothing.  And Otto said, look at these two.  They're like Melrose Place, and we're like, meet the press.  I bet you his girl didn't appreciate that or get it. 
[02:20:30]  Well, she was fucking disgusted with him because all night she had been talking about her grandfather who had committed suicide.  Oh, man, I heard this one.  Did I tell you this?  Her grandfather had committed suicide.  And we walk in.  It was really a sad story.  We walk into the kitchen.  It's like late, and her family is sleeping upstairs.  And there's a photo of her with her grandfather on the refrigerator.  And Otto just goes, hey, is this the one who tossed himself out the window?  I really love him. 
[02:21:00]  Yes, he jumped out of a window.  But it was the cavalier way he asked her, hey, is this the one who tossed himself out the window?  And then we just laughed naughtily.  He's a fun dude, man.  One of some of my favorite road moments ever were with Otto.  I love him.  We'll catch up with him tomorrow.  Dude, was this the one?  Because it was such a genuine, and I knew he did it to make me laugh, to be a prick.  I knew he was being a prick to her.  And he just threw a shot of pussy out the window to make me laugh, and it worked.  Nice.  Thank you, Roland.  You know I paid. 
[02:21:30]  We got...  What a fucking strange guy, man.  What, Roland?  No.  The other guy that you touch, he fucking giggles like an asshole.  That's not the sign of being molested at all.  You ever hear when we do the news with Roland?  Yeah.  We might have to do that today.  Roland, you know, I hate to be like the third guy into the hockey fight, but is this something  you're like, how...  I don't understand how you're not in control of an audible sound coming out when someone  touches you.  I don't know.  It's been this way forever.  And why do you talk like little Nicky? 
[02:22:00]  No.  He's a creep.  Get over there.  Roland.  It's been this way since...  With a mouth full of fucking bacon.  It's been this way since high school.  But what about junior high?  It didn't kick in yet?  As a kid, it's been this way.  Where'd you grow up?  Uh, San Monica.  California?  Yeah.  My homeboy!  What's up?  West side!  What's up?  Did you go to St. Monica's?  Yeah.  I like you, bro.  That's right.  When I broke my leg jogging with Father Tim, we'd meet at the rectory.  Do you know that story? 
[02:22:30]  Mm-hmm.  Meet my fucking priest.  He's 30.  And, uh, he was the new priest, and, you know, you get introduced to the new guy.  Right.  And he's like, he's a 30-year-old surfer.  That's...  All right, what's his problem?  No, he had a call.  He had a girl...  You know, he did girlfriend stuff, and he was going to go to college.  He used to party, and they used to be...  He used to go to, like, Burning Man and shit, and there used to be a...  Where do monks go?  To the monk place.  Yeah.  They go to the missionary. 
[02:23:00]  Monastery.  I don't know.  Monastery.  Monastery.  If you need the real answer.  I like that monk place.  Monastery.  There was a monastery, and they used to go there when they were, like, coming down to,  like, chill out before they had to see their parents.  And then he realized he was going there on the way to the party, and not...  Then he was staying there for four days, not talking.  And he had his calling.  He had his calling.  So, I meet him, excuse me, and I decide to haze the new guy.  Like, I'm a complete... 
[02:23:30]  How old are you?  40.  I'm a complete jerk.  This is recent.  This is three years ago.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  And I just got to St. Monica's, and it was home for me.  But this is why.  I go to him.  I say, yeah, nice to meet you.  Look, I want to ask you a quick question.  He goes, what is it?  I go, you know, I've always had a problem in the Bible with John 3.16.  It says, those who love Christ, the Son of God, shall love everlasting life.  And the parenthetical of that is that if you don't believe in Jesus, the Son of God,  you don't have everlasting life.  Like, Buddhists and Taoists and Muslims and Jews, like rabbis, pray more than I will ever 
[02:24:00]  pray in my life.  Like, they're all dying in a pit of fire because they don't believe in Jesus, the Son of God.  Native Americans had no concept of the Christ.  We put crosses in the ground.  They thought they were blanket holders.  They were like, hey, way to go.  Everyone born before 7 A.D., because he wasn't born at zero.  Everyone born before Christ, everyone's dying in a pit of fire.  Except this tiny group of people that's very country club-ish.  It seems exclusionary to me.  And he just looked at me and goes, yeah, bro, I don't know. 
[02:24:30]  And I knew I was home.  Like, I couldn't believe he wasn't going to just go like, this is how it goes.  Deal with it.  He just goes, yeah.  And then later through, like, he did like three funerals that day.  That's my biggest question right there, too.  Exactly what you just said.  Doesn't make sense.  But they're stories.  Yeah, but then I go, I don't think you're supposed to say that here.  But I love how he didn't bullshit you.  And I knew I was home.  I'm like, this is my spot.  Yeah.  And so Tuesdays and Thursdays, we'd run.  And Fridays and Mondays, we'd go to Krav Maga. 
[02:25:00]  Like, we'd go fight together.  And I was always bummed out that he didn't wear...  We'd surf together.  And I was bummed out that he didn't wear his priest collar surfing.  Because I thought, how cool is that?  Like, everyone in the water is stoned.  And you just see a guy in a priest collar.  You don't see the board.  You see a guy, like, skimming across the water.  Right.  With a determined look on his face.  Mass will be full, right?  But people wouldn't take him seriously.  They would think, oh, look at the idiot that's making believe he's a priest as he's in the water.  You know what I mean?  Could be.  Especially out there.  Until they saw him slashing a Jew's tire. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  This guy's the real deal.  Now, a couple things.  We should call him.  How old is he now?  30, 31?  32.  Okay.  Does he ever talk about pussy?  No.  Be honest.  No.  Or you can't go there.  No.  Never.  He never just talks like a man?  No.  He's not a man.  He's a priest.  He had a call.  He took a vow.  Come on.  But the vow, though, you have to want it.  Like, you have to see a little camel toe once in a while.  I'm not going to ask him, like, hey, do you...  No, no, no.  I understand.  But has he ever let his guard down?  Why not? 
[02:26:00]  It's the most offensive thing ever.  Do you ever think about sex?  That's a very fair question to ask another man.  How big is your cock?  I would ask you ever.  All those things.  Is it heavy?  No, you seem like you have a relationship with a guy, so has he ever let his guard down?  He had to let his guard down.  There isn't a guard to be let down.  I don't get that.  He's an enlightened...  I'm telling...  Hey, he's full of shit.  Have you ever seen him...  Have you ever seen...  Look, you know me.  Have you seen him look at a nice ass on the beach?  Nothing.  I'm telling...  I said in my show, when I broke...  We were jogging up the Santa Monica stairs, and I broke my leg, and I looked down. 
[02:26:30]  I was like, man, my fucking leg is killing me.  And I looked down, and I had three kneecaps.  And I go, oh, oh.  And I go, Father Tim, I broke my leg.  And he goes, whoa, that's not good, bro.  And he just keeps jogging up the steps, not looking at chicks.  I say it in my show, like, there he goes, just running up the steps, not looking at chicks.  And it's like the place to be seen.  And I'm telling you...  Is he gay?  No.  Did he help you with your broken leg?  I'm confused.  He's not sounding very priestly.  I said if Monsignor was here, he would have this straightened out, and you are new.  And you just said something else?  I used to love the Santa Monica stairs. 
[02:27:00]  How great is that?  I prefer the Santa Monica elevator.  Jimmy, you don't understand.  Oh, sorry.  I had to lean in and say that.  I think Dice turned me on to him.  Standing on your stairs?  I don't know.  You run up him.  But I don't think he goes all the way up.  There's no way he's doing those fucking stairs.  Dice's an animal, though.  He's a cardio animal.  That fucking cucksucker can literally do a thousand sit-ups in a workout.  How many stairs is it?  I forget.  It's got to be 50, right?  By the time you get to the top, you cannot feel your fucking thighs.  Right, Jay? 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  I'm just laughing at Jimmy because it's funny.  I would hate to have fucking that many steps.  Do you have to go back down?  You do more than one, too, man.  You go up and down.  You take a break when you get back down.  I've never spoken to him about that stuff at all because...  You never saw him let his guard down?  You're on a beach?  There's no guard.  Surfing?  I swear to you.  There is no guard.  Marijuana?  There is no guard to be lowered.  And he's a young guy?  He's had a calling.  He had a life, and then he had a calling. 
[02:28:00]  You really believe you just get the calling?  How could you not?  I don't know.  But is it a real calling, or is it something...  And again, not with him, but in general, is it something you just want a tax break?  Yeah.  Is it a real calling, or does he just want a free car?  Do you believe it, or do you think that this guy's looking around, but he's making damn  sure no one sees that he's looking around?  No, he's not looking around.  That's fucked up.  Not only do I believe it, I know it.  He's looking at somebody's crotch.  You think?  You're wrong.  I think.  You can't not look at him...  You're wrong and out of line. 
[02:28:30]  You can't not look at his pussy lips bulging and want to just fucking make a finger going...  I'm breaking your balls, and you're getting fucking fish.  He's right.  Messed his suit up, hugging him.  Because he's still a man.  Yeah.  He's a man of...  He's a man of God.  Yeah.  It's possible.  I mean...  If I call him right now, are you going to ask him this stuff?  I would love to ask him.  I...  Ugh.  What?  It's a very fair question because...  Ask him in private.  You know, I...  Oh, we don't know who he is.  Look, I don't know him.  Jay, I...  He's my priest!  If you give me permission, I certainly would.  I wouldn't...  I would do... 
[02:29:00]  No, on the air.  I'd be careful about it.  I wouldn't.  To maybe get an answer...  But to maybe get an answer about it.  Because I don't believe that.  How do you...  You think a priest who we've already established what church he's at...  He works for the fucking Vatican.  Let's not forget.  He's like...  Right.  But I wouldn't...  It's the fucking rank and file organization.  The respect?  Yeah.  Because I'm confused.  What about sexual urges?  I'm confused by it.  The most confusing part of the priesthood for any guy is the sexual urges.  How do you...  What happens?  This is what I would do, Jay.  I go, look...  That's what makes being a priest a special, special thing. 
[02:29:30]  Jay, I would do it this way.  I go, you're on a beach with Jay Moore.  You guys are surfing.  There's beautiful girls around.  I'm sure he...  Explain why you're not looking.  That's all.  I'm sure he's looking and saying, wow, there's a really beautiful girls over there.  You don't think he gets turned on?  You have to.  I mean, he's a human being.  Yeah, right.  What do you do with the sexual urges?  When you get that, how far do you go with them?  Do you wonder what her clit looks like?  That's what I would ask him.  I mean, I would try to keep it, you know, between the lines.  I would be respectful.  I'd go, do you want to eat her ass till the cows come home? 
[02:30:00]  All due respect.  You know that's where we would go to.  Of course.  Jay would give us a little...  Hold on.  Larry in Massachusetts?  Larry!  Larry, who's an animal?  You're going to find your...  Your mother's an animal!  You're going to find your mind seeing it dead the whole way, Larry.  This guy just called me an animal.  Yeah.  He can't believe it.  Is Larry a good baby name?  No, it's one of the worst.  Yeah, that's bad, too, right?  Victor...  Victor, Larry...  Gary is also atrocious.  Hideous.  This is my picture of a baby.  He had a picture of a little onesie with anchors on it.  I don't know why there was a nautical theme to little boy things.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:30:30]  Anchors and tugboats.  They're masculine.  This is my son, Gary.  Then you've got to change Victor's diaper.  You know my son, Larry?  Oh, look at little Larry.  Larry.  Larry!  Hello, little boys.  All right.  The grease that Jay's talking about, I don't know the gentleman, but...  So based on that...  Yeah, exactly.  Making a decision of faith is an irrational decision.  Right.  For you.  You're making a decision...  No, no, no, wait, wait.  It's irrational for you. 
[02:31:00]  No, no, no.  No, he's not criticizing him.  I think he's speaking in general.  Yeah, I'm just trying to understand it, by the way, Jay.  But if you don't make a decision of faith, you're called.  We are a called people, Larry.  All right.  Without talking to the guy, I'm not going to understand this is what it comes down to.  Can we talk...  I apologize.  No, no, no.  Not after...  What did Larry just say?  I thought you meant Larry.  Go ahead, Larry.  What if we turned Jimmy's mic off?  I wouldn't do that.  No, Jimmy would be cool.  A person who makes a decision of faith, whether they're called or not, is immaterial.  It's an irrational decision. 
[02:31:30]  Now, and I'm not saying it's a bad decision, but the person that made the decision, in  hindsight, to them, it's the most rational decision they ever made in their lives.  To them, it gives them total focus, total dedication, and they're comfortable in their  skin, and they're comfortable with their decision.  That's why when Jay says there's no mask to let down, he's absolutely right.  There is no mask to let down.  I've always thought that a lot...  But how is that irrational?  If they have total focus and total control, how is that...  That would make it a rational decision. 
[02:32:00]  I understand that, but if you're...  If you make a leap of faith, faith is belief in things unseen.  It is irrational by nature, I think.  Yeah.  When the Savior said to the Apostle, you have seen and yet not believed, how much more blessed  are those who have not seen and have yet believed?  He didn't actually say that.  He emailed that to Paul when the whole Corinthians thing was happening.  Boo.  I just wanted to say Corinthians. 
[02:32:30]  Go ahead.  But that's the point I'm making.  Ultimately, looking at it at face value is an irrational decision because you make...  Yeah.  You make a decision to totally turn your back on everything you've been.  Yeah.  And become something that you have no idea really, ultimately, what you're getting into.  That's marriage.  And in eyesight, you look back at the most rational decision, like, oh... 
[02:33:00]  And then...  Now, I'm not trying to criticize Opie, but he keeps saying about the mask and how he used  to do...  He has completely turned his back on everything that he was and become a new creature in Christ.  I think that...  I'm just trying to understand, sir.  So Larry's pro-priest.  Yeah, yeah, he is, obviously.  All right.  I was confused by the irrational decision.  Let me go back to Jay.  Did this guy ever get laid before?  Yeah.  Like, did Mother Teresa ever fuck?  I always wanted that.  So, you...  So...  Did somebody fuck Mother Teresa in the throat?  Did one...  Why? 
[02:33:30]  She's just a lady.  When she was a young chick, did one guy lay her back on the bed and fucking hang her  head over it?  Give her a good fucking throat yogurt.  So now that...  You guys just fucking trolling for another suspension?  Why?  Are you allowed to say that?  This is actually...  All right.  She's dead.  I know now.  I know the rules now, finally.  All right.  I don't know.  I would say that fucking anywhere.  I mean, I guess we could clean it up, but if the guy was having sex before he became a  priest, that seems like...  I'd say that.  Well, I'm asking if he did.  I don't know.  Okay.  But let's say he did.  How do you now move on from that? 
[02:34:00]  I don't understand.  Larry?  Larry?  I mean, I don't know.  I live with a woman who made a decision of faith.  I live with a fundamentalist born-again believer.  And I understand how that decision is made.  I understand it.  That doesn't mean...  And it's not for me to make.  I don't know my wife or her beliefs.  Right.  But she is a true...  And it works for her.  I understand that. 
[02:34:30]  And my cousin Ronnie, the pastor, I was sitting next to him at the balcony of the church and  not paid attention to the evangelist when the Holy Spirit touched him and he went down  and made a confession of faith and became a pastor.  He did that when he was five.  I find that a lot of them, dude, a lot of them are running away...  I understand.  I find...  Larry, I think a lot of them are running away from something.  Not consciously.  But the reason that there's a lot of pedophiles in the church is not because the church is  intrinsically evil.  Well, it's because people go there thinking it's going to save them from themselves.  I feel... 
[02:35:00]  I think there's just as many pedophiles...  And I'm going to stick up for Catholicism here.  I think there's just as many pedophiles in temples and Judaism.  The Catholics have got...  Believe me, they've earned it.  Don't get me wrong.  But it's getting the press.  But if you're going to tell me that rabbis aren't doing the same thing and all these fundamental  Baptist preachers, you're born-again evangelical, like the Ted Haggerts of the world, it's just  that the Catholics, there's a deep-rooted prejudice towards Catholics. 
[02:35:30]  The Ku Klux Klan recruited women on a strict basis that you can come in here and hate Catholics  because their memberships were so down because people weren't really into hating on blacks  so much anymore.  So the way the Ku Klux Klan got membership back up around a million people was, hey, the Catholics  take their orders from Rome, which means they're not real Americans.  That's how it's swell.  You know how many Catholics died in World War II?  Around six million. 
[02:36:00]  No, no, no.  But I'm not coming from that place.  The Klan does what they do.  I'm saying the difference between Catholicism and a lot of them is the lack of sex you're  allowed to have.  Like rabbis, I think it attracts less deviants because you can have sex.  So I think deviants are less likely to become rabbis to escape their demons because you can  have sex as a rabbi.  I think someone whose sexual leanings are dangerous wants to go someplace where they  will feel saved and safe.  And they never have to address it.  They never have to address it.  That's why I think you have a higher level in Catholicism.  It's not that Catholics are worse people. 
[02:36:30]  Or they just know how to keep it under wraps.  Jimmy's wrong about that.  Okay.  I do think Jimmy's wrong about that.  And because there are so many homosexuals in the Catholic Church that there are seminaries  that are run by homosexuals.  They're called pink palaces.  And I know that from a person who was attacked by a priest as an adult going to seminary.  And he's so angry at God about what happened to him in the seminary that he can't abide  any Christian stricture of any kind. 
[02:37:00]  But the Catholic Church is not a pedophile establishment.  It's an homosexual establishment.  Well, maybe there are a lot of...  Jesus Christ!  All right, we straighten that out then.  All right, whatever it is.  You know what?  Homosexuality, a lot of them I think are running from.  I don't think it's a gay establishment.  But a lot of them I think that become priests are running away from that.  Because I know guys that I knew on sober retreats who were priests who came out of the closet.  Let's not let that take away from the few that truly are touched by the Spirit and devote 
[02:37:30]  their lives to God.  I'm sure there's actually a lot more than a few Catholic charities.  Catholics are fucking a good organization.  Catholics started hospitals.  Yeah, I'm not saying they're not good people.  I said that aggressively.  The hierarchy of the Catholicism, though, has brought it on themselves by shipping these  guys from point A to point B.  They have brought this wrath on themselves by being pigs and hiding it and by fucking  not addressing it.  And that Pope right now, you're going to tell me the Pope is fucking a heterosexual male?  Does anybody look at that Pope and listen to him talk and see him in his red shoes and 
[02:38:00]  think he's a straight guy?  Of course not!  Yeah, let's call him my priest, Nick.  What?  Come on, you can look at a guy and see that.  We would be cool with your priest.  I wouldn't be mean to your priest.  I wouldn't be disrespectful.  You're too.  All right.  I'm more respectful than you think.  I mean, he's got you going back, right?  He was the...  Was he the one that got you going back to church?  No, I walked into St. Monica's and I just...  I was overcome.  I walked into St. Monica's Church on a lark.  I was in the neighborhood.  I walked in. 
[02:38:30]  Overcome.  I was overcome.  And then I went back and I went back again.  And then I found out after the fact, that's where my wife was baptized.  And I was like, well, that's incredibly awesome.  Like my wife as a baby was baptized here by the same guy that I just watched a mass.  And every time I go, it's like they read my file and exactly...  When I was a kid, church was incredibly boring.  And I was given a pencil to draw during church because it's like a complete snore.  At St. Monica's, every time, every homo, it's like they read my file. 
[02:39:00]  And whatever I'm going through, for some reason, they just pull some shit out of thin air.  He might as well be going, Jay, let me explain to you what needs to be done here.  I've never experienced that in my life.  I mean, I'm talking every time I go.  Do you have a problem with the organized religion, though, in general?  No, I love...  Now, I got tired of telling people, no, but I'm spiritual. 
[02:39:30]  And I just put all my chips into Catholicism because I love the structure.  And every part of my life, from my old self to my new self, had good structure to it and kindness and warmth.  And the only thing where I was wayward was I believed in a higher power and the great electron in the sky, as Carlin said, that doesn't judge, doesn't hate. 
[02:40:00]  And I just never had a place with, this is how it goes.  And it's a great...  You sit next to homeless people.  There's a gay and lesbian station to the cross.  It's a very progressive church.  Like, Schwarzenegger's there.  Joe Torrey's there.  They accept it.  Conan O'Brien is there.  And there's homeless people and gay people.  And they accept the gays.  The sign above the door says, all are welcome.  That's rare.  Conan O'Brien was almost fired because of the amount of gays and homeless people.  All right, well, that I like.  And the sign. 
[02:40:30]  He said, all are welcome.  How did he get past that?  Because that's not really accepted in a lot of places.  All are welcome.  All right.  He just stood there and kept saying, all are welcome.  They probably made him put almost in front of that.  Almost all are welcome.  A good percentage of you are welcome.  Five percent can go out and fuck their mothers.  Let's talk to the young priest next.  No.  You don't trust us?  We're friends.  We're friends.  I would ask very respectful questions.  I would, too.  Like what?  Because maybe.  You ever eat an ass?  No, I would never do that. 
[02:41:00]  What's the matter with you?  I would never do that.  I've never done that in an interview.  I would say, what do you do with sexual urges?  Because they have to happen.  And was it?  I got to cut you off.  Right there, this guy.  That's disrespectful?  He's a fucking priest.  So what?  Yeah, but I don't.  How can that guy hear people's sexual confessions and hear without being.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying don't ask him that if you and him are in that room over there.  Maybe not ask him over the air.  He's in front of a million fucking people where he's representing an incredible.  He's representing Catholicism. 
[02:41:30]  I think that's a great place because everybody wants to know that.  I think it's a great question.  It's not disrespectful.  And it's a great place for him to go, you know what?  Here's the misconception people have.  And here as a man is what I do.  And here's how I humanize myself to people who are listening.  So a priest is not this weird oracle who you can't connect to, but a priest is a guy that  made a decision.  But he, there's so many.  I love this juice.  There's so many people above him that have one wrong move.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you talk about, not censorship, but you talk about like. 
[02:42:00]  Job security.  Towing the company line.  Okay.  Like, hey, Father Tom, we heard you on this show talking about your sexual urges.  Like, what were you thinking?  And then he's at a fucking ice station in Alaska preaching to Inuits.  Yeah.  Well, maybe that's where, uh, fuck.  Go on.  I can't remember the line.  No, it was just in Alaska.  My lawyer is so good.  You're going to be working in Alaska.  I just can't remember what he said they were going to be doing.  Pacino and Scarface.  Oh, my lawyer is so good. 
[02:42:30]  So good.  I like Pacino and Insomnia.  I did, too.  That's a great movie.  I'm not who you think I am.  I think you're a piece of shit.  Guys like you on my job.  You think you're, the best line, you think you're different because you, I'm not going  to try to do the impression, because you painted her nails.  Come on.  She has that?  Pacino says it to Robin Williams because they all want to be like the special serial killer.  Yeah.  You think you're special because you painted her nails.  Come on.  That's great.  And he goes, you're about as interesting to me as a pipe is to a fucking plumber. 
[02:43:00]  And then he falls asleep in his lap.  And he sneezed and his little wig came forward.  An adorable wig.  Pacino's hair is not a wig.  Nope.  Jimmy, swear to God, on my son's eyes.  I believe that you're talking, I don't think you're lying.  Let me, I swear to God.  No, what?  I swear to God.  That's fake hair.  Shut up.  Pacino's?  It has to be.  People think mine's fake.  No, they don't.  No, we don't.  Really?  I fucking quit Twitter.  Pacino.  I'm tired of hearing about how fat I was and how bald I was. 
[02:43:30]  Is fucking.  Wait, can I.  Look how fat I am, Oak.  You're not fat.  I'm a big fat blob of shit, apparently.  You're not a big fat blob of shit.  Jay.  You put a few on, but you're not a big fat blob of shit.  I did put a few on.  I want to share.  It's called being happily married.  You put on a few pounds, Jake?  Nah, knock it right off.  Knock it right off.  Both pounds.  I want to share.  It's ginger ale.  What?  I want to share with Jimmy, because it was a great moment.  And after Friday's show, I almost got you.  Oh, again with the lists.  No, no, lists.  You started the list.  I stopped the list.  Eddie Trunk started this shit.  I almost had you tapping that guy's shoulder Friday on the way out, thinking it was Al Pacino. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Be honest.  Be honest.  Some fucking strange guy, right when we were leaving, right after I almost shit my pants.  I wish I fucking filmed this, by the way.  He goes, it's Al Pacino.  And I look, and I only see it behind the guy.  And from behind, it was Al.  There's no, it's maybe four inches of height, which I should have taken into account immediately.  And I swear to God, ah, ah.  Like, I went to say Al. 
[02:44:30]  And I went, ah.  And I went, he's fucking 5'9".  It was the closest.  I almost had you.  It was incredible.  I almost fucking had you.  I said hi, Al, to a guy in front of Plata Forma, who I thought was Pacino.  And it wasn't?  No.  I said, hey, Al, because I really thought it was Pacino.  It was not him.  Oh, hello.  I used to have him on my phone.  We should have called him.  Let's call Al.  How did you get rid of it?  Why did you get rid of Al Pacino's number?  How do you lose Pacino's number?  What's wrong with you?  Because you get a message like, hey, it's Michael from Al's office.  He wanted to know if you wanted to come by today.  And you're like, what the fuck?  Really?  Like, fucking Mike Wolf from Al's office has to, like, just fucking call me. 
[02:45:00]  He's Pacino.  He should have somebody call you.  But the whole point is...  Yeah, Jay, we can't relate to that.  He's Al Pacino.  We can't relate to, like, not taking a call.  Part of our friendship was that I was the...  Not the, but I was one of the people that it was just two guys hanging out.  Sure.  And, like, could I call you?  I'm going to call you later today, and we'll talk about it.  And he would call me. 
[02:45:30]  I just sounded like, Quinn.  And we'll talk about it.  Let me call you later today, since I'm Al Pacino, and I'm a big shot.  And then all of a sudden...  That's why Pesci didn't do two Scorsese movies,  because people from Scorsese's office started to call Pesci,  and he fucking freaked out.  Wow.  He doesn't work, Joe.  Isn't that strange?  Just fucking...  Just wants to play golf every day.  It's probably because he also looks a little weird, too.  Could you play a 25-year-old?  And he can see the fucking...  And he says yes.  Yeah.  And he can.  Because of his work. 
[02:46:00]  His work's amazing.  No, because of his work.  Oh, wow.  In his space.  He actually could play...  Did I tell you, me and my wife saw him at a gas station,  and we were having a conversation.  Did Joey fuck Vicky in Raging Bull?  We're talking about that in my truck.  And I go, I think he did, because he goes,  I'm your brother.  You ask me...  I always fucking give you the answer the first time.  You don't have to ask me twice.  Remember that?  Yes.  Okay.  And then he says, did you fuck my wife?  He doesn't answer.  He says in the beginning of the movie,  I always give you the answer the first time. 
[02:46:30]  You don't have to fucking ask me twice.  He never gives him an answer.  He didn't, but I also think that he was so appalled at that question.  He put up with so much of Jake's shit,  and he was so close to Jake,  and he got into a fight because he didn't want Vicky fucking Salve.  But I think he got into the fight because he was also fucking her,  and only someone that was fucking someone else would say,  the guy don't even want to fuck me anymore.  You wouldn't say that to somebody that hasn't known you carnally,  in my opinion.  No, I think that, uh,  I think every indicator to me was that Pesci was appalled by that, 
[02:47:00]  and was annoyed that, A,  that she was fucking making a fool out of Jake,  and, B, he knew that Jake would kill Salve and get himself killed.  What, do you think you're right?  You're not right.  You're wrong.  That's why Jake made up with him at the end.  He knew.  He knew he was wrong.  It wasn't Jake in the book, though.  It's Pete.  I asked Joe.  Joe doesn't know.  We were at the gas station,  and fucking Joe pulls up and goes,  you motherfucker!  And I look out,  it's fucking Pesci at the pump next to me yelling at me.  And I go,  I'm like,  oh my God! 
[02:47:30]  Like, it was too bizarre for words.  And I go,  Joe,  I get out of my truck,  he goes,  what are you doing?  And I go,  uh,  we were just having this conversation.  Do you think,  uh,  Joey in Raging Bull  fucked Vicky?  And he goes,  you know,  I think he fucked her  because I fucked her.  I mean,  I knew her like fucking two hours,  and I fucked her.  It's funny.  So, I think he fucked her.  I mean,  everybody fucked her.  We all fucked her.  Nobody gave a fuck.  He fucking laid out in two seconds.  Oh, fuck.  You fucking prick.  You got me doing regular and linen 
[02:48:00]  in a fucking S500 Mercedes,  you fucking,  I'm fucking John Barrymore.  John.  I had to save it.  That was funny.  I'll go,  Poop.  All right,  we'll break too.  Stay there.  The virus.  Sirius.  Sirius X.  You're listening to O.P. Anthony.  O.P.  And Anthony.  Feeling better, Jimmy?  Thank you.  I'm better than I was.  I'm still, 
[02:48:30]  my nose still bothers me  and my throat's still sore.  Yeah.  It's going to be a couple days,  but I'm pretty high functioning  when I'm sick.  You know?  I'm a puss when I'm sick.  I mean,  I don't like being sick.  It blows,  but I mean...  Well,  we're hoping that Anthony  calls from the cruise ship.  He's probably fucking  passed out right now.  No,  I don't expect today,  but hopefully sometime this week.  930.  Depends on where he is.  It's already fucking 930.  How did that happen?  Yeah.  What else is going on? 
[02:49:00]  Jay's shitting.  Is he?  That reeked in the bathroom.  I'm just looking at my Twitter  to see the last time  Ant tweeted.  Yeah,  he must be in a place  where you just can't fucking tweet  is what I'm thinking.  Yeah,  I was chip tweeting him.  I had fucking...  Patrice was talking  basketball  on Twitter.  Just the games.  And...  What do we got?  Everyone was chip tweeting Patrice  and I was fucking  howling  reading these idiotic tweets  to Patrice. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Oh!  You got UConn tonight, Jimmy?  I don't care about College Bowl.  If you said,  look,  UConn is playing...  If you told me another team,  I'd believe you.  The only reason I'm saying UConn  is because it's the father-in-law.  He likes the UConn, so...  UConn.  Who are they playing?  Do you care, Jay?  Do you do college basketball?  No, I hate it.  Because they only stayed there  for one year  and it's just...  I didn't go to college,  so who gives a fuck?  I think you're a big  college sports guy.  I didn't know that.  No.  He's a sports guy, but...  You don't like hockey, though,  I remember.  No, I like hockey now.  What turned you? 
[02:50:00]  I started hosting  the NHL Awards.  That'll turn you  a nice paycheck.  A check.  Right.  I'm going to the Rangers game  tonight.  Who are they playing?  Bruins.  Fighting for seeding  in the playoffs now.  Yeah, they are.  With that maniac  Sean Avery  skating around the ice  telling everybody  that they're having sex  with his sloppy seconds.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, hey, Sean,  I hate to break it to you.  She wasn't exactly  a hot piece of ass  when you had her,  you dope.  Fucking skanky actress.  Avery got beat up by...  What's his name  on the Islanders  the other day?  Really? 
[02:50:30]  It was a good fight.  Yeah, Avery fucking ate it.  And that's what  everyone in the NHL...  Ate it.  Like, he's the guy  you want eating.  Ranger fans will not  argue this point.  Everywhere he goes,  he's a bad guy.  Yeah.  He got suspended  by the NHL  because he was having  sex with Alyssa Cuthbert.  I don't know  any of these fucking...  I don't know who she is.  Don't...  When you watch, like,  Us Weekly  or any of those magazines,  don't...  I can't fucking tell...  I feel like my parents.  I cannot tell  any of them apart.  I don't know who they are.  And it's all...  It's the blonde ones. 
[02:51:00]  E-Rock knows.  The brunette ones.  E-Rock, who was it?  Alicia Cuthbert.  She's from the girl  next door.  He just said that.  You, you motherfucker,  you go over my head,  I'll kill you.  Wait, no,  E-Rock's gonna correct you.  What did he say, E-Rock?  I said E-Rock.  He said E-Rock Cuthbert  or something.  I said it was E-Rock Cuthbert.  I said Cuthbert.  He did say that.  It was close enough.  Whatever.  And then they broke up  and she started having  sex with whom? 
[02:51:30]  E-Rock?  Hello?  Come on, E-Rock, please.  You're dying on the vine here.  You fucking stuttering prick.  Listen.  What am I,  a fucking mirage  and a pain on the pain on mine list?  Yeah, you got me  on the pain on mine list, kid?  I want to thank  Steven S. from Bayshore.  It was Haley, yeah.  Haley beat up Avery bad.  Fuck yeah.  Avery fucking ate it.  Now, this is what fascinates me  about hockey players.  Sean Avery's gonna be  on the ice tonight.  Yeah.  Like, if you and I  took that beating,  we wouldn't come to work  for two weeks.  I don't know.  I don't fucking  ice on our head,  or like,  our faces wrapped up 
[02:52:00]  like fucking, uh...  Yeah.  Did you see the,  someone had a picture  of, I don't even know  the guy's name,  where his nose  was pretty much detached  from his fucking face  this year.  He took puck right to the nose.  Duncan Keith  had seven teeth  knocked out in a game  and fucking finished the game.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone tweeted me,  you know Jimmy's bored with you  when he takes out his iPad.  No.  Oh, shit.  That's what they say on Twitter.  He's looking up with stuff.  Completely a lie.  I just looked at a picture  of Sean Avery.  Trying to know  what he looked like.  Show it to me.  Without touching anything else.  Hold on.  Without touching anything else.  What's it say, 
[02:52:30]  what's it say  in my fucking Google?  Trannies.  No, I wouldn't need  Google for that.  I know the site.  Surprise?  Tranny surprise?  No.  TS Seduction's a good one.  It's never really  a surprise at all  because they all have  that same voice  like China  from WWE.  They all have midget voices.  Take your time  and there's no big  fucking hurry.  You know,  my daddy says  I'm a really good babysitter.  We're just like  any other family. 
[02:53:00]  No, you're not  because I don't  take a fucking ladder  to get my cereal.  We might have to go back  to lists.  Top five lists.  No, can we talk more  about Charlie Sheehan?  Can we hear more  Charlie Sheehan shit?  It's too fascinating  for words.  Winning, duh.  Yeah, winning.  Bye-bye.  Well, we got one more  clip from the actual show.  That was very close  to Dreyfuss also.  Why doesn't anyone  have any crystal clear  clips of Charlie Sheehan?  This is all cell phone shit.  They fucking robbed us  because they're miserable 
[02:53:30]  because their mother's  taking up the fucking ass.  Stay in the ring.  Don't get out  of the fucking ring.  You won.  Make him go first.  My favorite Dreyfuss  is Whose Life Is It Anyway?  That's a good one.  Cal Burnett did the play.  It's great.  He plays a quadriplegic,  an artist who becomes  quadriplegic.  Spawn, you ready?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that laugh?  Look at him  taking me serious.  He's a quad.  He's a sculptor 
[02:54:00]  who becomes a quad.  And fights like the guy.  It's very good.  John Cassavetes is in it.  I don't want to see that.  Why?  It's good.  It's too depressing.  Oh, man.  It's great.  Well, I can't.  Is Playboy Radio up here?  I saw the signs.  I don't know.  You come off the elevator,  big brewer's sign.  Not a sign of you.  No picture of you out there.  None for you, Mr. Hitler.  And they don't understand  why we bitch so much.  You wouldn't even know  we worked here.  Whatever.  So, Avery, tonight,  Avery plays after getting beat up? 
[02:54:30]  Of course.  Yeah, hockey guys  are fucking animals.  I was at a Kings game.  Billy Guerin was on the...  Guerin, nice.  We were friends at the time.  We were still friendly.  But he was on the Oilers  and they came to the Kings  and me, him, and Dougie Waite  had plans to go hang out  after the game.  And it's fucking brawly.  It's like, you know,  when it's 4-0 early,  you're like,  this is going to be terrible.  That's not my kind of hockey.  It's never terrible.  That means the fight's dark.  Ah, but just when guys  are just...  Somebody's going to get fucked.  When George LaRock  was on that fucking team,  somebody's going to hit  in the face with a stick. 
[02:55:00]  That fucking animal  doesn't know how to play hockey.  And there's this huge fight  and all you see,  Billy Guerin's getting  let off the ice.  He's captain.  And he didn't know  he had a fucking...  He didn't know he was ejected.  So he's just skating  off the ice to go to the box.  He looks up.  He sees he's got a fucking...  You know, he's out.  And he just fucking  makes a U-turn...  Peels, takes his arm  away from the ref  and just goes back  into the pile.  And all you see  is a nine  and a fucking elbow  going like this.  Getting his money's worth, right?  So we're in the tunnel  after the hockey game 
[02:55:30]  and he comes out  of the fucking locker room.  He's got seven stitches  over his eye.  It's swollen shut.  Both of his hands  are wrapped in ice.  And he goes,  you guys want to go eat?  What kind of fucking animal  is this?  And Dougie Wade  is like...  He's like 5'8",  180.  He's not a...  He doesn't fight a lot.  No, but he was in the pot.  I mean, if I got fucking hit  on the way here,  I just would have...  You would have had to call in  and say,  I can't make it.  His brother's name  is Lossom.  Chip, you've done it again. 
[02:56:00]  Let's say hi to Rich  in New York City.  We got Jay Moore  who's at Foxwoods  on Friday night  and Jimmy's going  to be in Columbus.  You got to sell tickets  up there, Jimmy?  At the Funny Bone.  I don't know.  I haven't checked.  Nah, you should be good.  I hope so.  Rich, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  I was wondering  if you guys spoke  about Snooki  on WrestleMania last night.  I know you got  the resident wrestling guy  in there.  We did not.  Yeah, a lot of people  saw the WrestleMania, though.  You don't do WrestleMania,  do you?  You don't do wrestling, do you?  I would if they would  fucking wrestle  once in a while. 
[02:56:30]  It's all just...  It's all Piper's Pit.  I don't have anything  on this.  What do you have  on Snooki  at WrestleMania?  What's your take  on it, Rich?  It was disgusting.  It was horrible.  What happened?  Oh, wow.  She's athletic, though.  She did some...  Rich, what happened  that night at the Copa?  What happened?  Rich, you wanted us  to talk about this.  What do you got?  You fucking dope talk.  That night,  Snooki slammed  Triple H's head  in the door,  in a taxi cab.  I told you about that.  Didn't I? 
[02:57:00]  No.  Rich, you...  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  You called up  about Snooki  at WrestleMania  pretty much stopping  our show,  so at least save us  and give us something.  I was trying  to watch WrestleMania.  Hey, everybody,  we're all gonna get laid.  This is going great.  Yeah, I know.  And then he hangs up  and leaves the shit  for us to clean up.  You got all the answers, Rich,  but you ain't got  the right answers.  Trying to watch WrestleMania.  You got a big stomach.  I can't see anything.  If I find out different, Rich, 
[02:57:30]  I'm gonna kill somebody.  Kill everybody.  Snooki.  Kill Snooki.  Kill Triple H.  Kill Vince.  Kill me.  You put you with them.  Oh, my God.  I'm a joke.  It's the greatest.  He's just trying  to stand up for himself  and he fucking  puts his foot in his mouth.  It's the biggest mind fuck.  Sorry.  Two biggest mind fucks  in our movie vernacular,  I would guess,  would be Keitel  and Bad Lieutenant  getting the guys  to continue to gamble 
[02:58:00]  when they want  to pull their money  out of the NLCS.  And Keitel cracked out,  says,  I went to the stadium today.  I drove there  and I saw  Darryl Strawberry.  And he looked me  in my eyes  and he told me  he's saving it  for the big one.  It never could go  any other way.  It's gotta go  seven games.  That nigga  is killing us.  But it's part  of a bigger plan.  It's gotta go seven. 
[02:58:30]  Did I steer you wrong?  Good.  Then you owe me money.  And they all go,  alright,  okay.  Like,  I didn't realize  you went to the park  and talked to fucking  Darryl Strawberry  at ten in the morning.  No,  he's telling the truth.  Fucking,  a crackhead  just drove up  to Shea Stadium  and said,  Darryl,  can I talk to you  for a second?  Hey look,  cop that I don't know,  I'm saving it  for the big one.  I don't try to hit  game one or game two.  I save it for the big one.  And they,  like Victor Argo  and David Caruso  go,  oh yeah,  fuck it,  put me in.  And they fucking win. 
[02:59:00]  And the other one  is fucking De Niro,  mind fucking Pesci.  And if you think  of another one,  please tell me,  of the greatest  mind fucks of all time  is,  kill everybody,  Joey.  Kill fucking Salvi,  Tommy,  me.  Kill me.  Whoa, whoa,  what do you mean you?  Me.  Do me a fucking favor  and fucking kill me.  Put me out of my  fucking misery.  You put you with them.  You could have said  anybody.  You said you.  That means something.  You don't even know  what that means.  He says you don't even  know what that means. 
[02:59:30]  And Pesci for a split second  goes,  did I fuck his wife?  Like now I don't even know  what the fuck's going on.  Yeah,  he's very confused by it.  What?  And he smiles a little.  What?  You don't even know  what you mean.  Well,  he can't believe it's turned.  Like he was so frustrated  he blows up like,  you fucking idiot  and then he can't believe  he's on the defensive again.  A little less fucking  and a little fucking  a little more.  I've got it backwards.  I'm not staying here.  If Lenore calls,  tell her I left.  You're a sick fuck.  I'm not that sick.  I'm going to answer you.  I'm not telling you nothing.  This is a crazy place.  But why wouldn't he tell him? 
[03:00:00]  He said,  I'm your brother.  You asked me once.  I always tell you the first time.  Because he fucking  resented the question.  Absolutely not.  I think he absolutely did.  He was resentful of the question.  I went to the stadium today.  That's a fucking...  And I saw Darryl Strawberry  and he told me,  he goes,  he told me,  in my eyes,  it never could go  any other way.  Let's go to Walter in Connecticut  because we're now going to  find out about Snooki.  God's going to get you  for that, Walter.  Walter.  Hey, Ope.  Hey.  First of all,  Rich,  if you're listening, 
[03:00:30]  you show-stopping motherfucker.  Yeah,  now you've got to  fucking clean up the mess,  Walter.  Let's do this.  Hold on.  Ope,  what's your baby's name?  Walter.  Why is this happening today?  Sorry,  Walter.  Go ahead.  We're trying to picture  some of you guys  as babies.  I don't want to clean  the diaper of Walter.  That's the best news  a mother could get.  Walter's not moving.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Sorry, 
[03:01:00]  Walter.  Go ahead,  Walter.  It's not a cute name,  I know.  I'm going to grab  Walter by his ankles.  What do we got?  Crack his skull  on the fucking sink.  That's mine.  I wrote that.  Look at the end of Caligula.  That's exactly...  You never see the end  of Caligula?  No.  You never saw Caligula's end?  No,  I never saw Caligula's beginning.  Could you watch the end  of Caligula,  please?  I gave it away.  Do we even have that?  I don't want to ruin  the ending for me either.  It's everyone in this town  on Joe.  What?  I don't want to ruin  the end for me either.  What was the third baby name?  Victor, Walter,  and what was the other one?  Lyle?  Gary.  No,  we had a...  It was somebody else. 
[03:01:30]  Gary's bad.  Sven?  Walter,  go ahead.  Snooki,  WrestleMania,  you're up.  Come on,  Captain.  She got in the ring  for about a minute  and a half.  Oh,  man,  we're out of company.  A couple of somersaults,  splashed her fat little body  onto the...  I forget who it was.  Pinned her,  and that was this.  She didn't do nothing.  Well,  you just said  she did somersaults,  which I didn't even know  she had in her,  and she pinned somebody.  That's something,  right?  That's all bullshit.  It's a minute and a half.  They knew she was  going to be a waste,  so the other people  carried the load,  let her get the win,  and that was it.  It was done.  What do you mean?  She didn't really wrestle 
[03:02:00]  and win?  I'm pretty sure  that's not the first load  she carried.  Hey!  Whoa!  You're mad that she didn't  do fake wrestling good.  Oh, no,  I'm not mad about that.  I'm mad about  Rich calling in  and stopping the show.  Does it annoy you  that Snooki's so famous?  Yes, it does.  I was asking Jay Morris.  She's getting paid more  to speak at,  I think,  Rutgers than Tony Morrison is.  Yeah, and then Rutgers  had a very, very famous  award-winning  pool surprise winner.  Yeah, Rutgers had to defend  that they had Snooki.  $37,000.  Who gives a fuck? 
[03:02:30]  If people want to go  see Snooki talk,  then who cares?  That's Jimmy and half of me.  What?  One and me and half of Jimmy.  $37,000 to fucking do a college?  I don't get near that.  No, it's...  What?  I thought it was two.  I think it was $32,000  and I think they were  going to have Tony Morrison.  That's me and half of Jimmy  or Jimmy and half of me.  That's close, right?  One and a half of us, maybe.  Jimmy's numbers have gone up, Jay.  Big star.  Not that close, they haven't.  Jimmy's a big star.  College is...  Jimmy's a big star.  Caligula!  How'd you never see Caligula? 
[03:03:00]  Nice.  I thought it was eight.  Yeah, but so what?  It's still out.  It's on the internet.  Because I never dreamt  about a woman  with little Jimmy Robinson,  the old lady.  Oh, Helen.  Helen.  My imaginary friend, Helen.  She had a beehive hairdo,  frosted.  I know, believe me.  Let's go to Bill in Florida.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure, why not?  Let's see how...  And then Jimmy.  Everyone stay in the line.  The lady's line is open, too.  Billy!  Hey!  Welcome aboard.  What's up, Bill?  He's just kidding little fucking manners. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, Billy, you got it all wrong.  I'm breaking your balls  and you're right away  you're getting fucking fed.  I don't do that no more.  I'll go home  and get your fucking shine balls.  Motherfucking mutt!  Go ahead.  Jay, when you came up  with that line  about grabbing Walter  by the ankles  I had just taken  a big sip of bread bowl  and the shit  went out of my nose  and it felt like  fucking ass  was eating my nose  out from the inside.  Oh, God.  I'm so glad you said that  because Otto and George  stole that line from me.  Jesus.  I got a great baby name.  Yeah.  My grandmother's name 
[03:04:00]  was Elsie Victoria.  Elsie's...  That's a little old school.  You can handle Elsie.  Elsie's very like  Beverly Hills.  You can handle Elsie.  I bet you that name's  coming back, right?  Coming back in L.A.?  Fuck you out, boys.  How is the bitch?  She's out the window  she hurled herself out of.  Yeah.  Is this the one  who tossed herself  out the window?  Oh, so perfectly barbaric.  The committee said  they considered  Snooki's appearance  fee reasonable  since other people  including Parks and Recreation  star Aziz Ansari 
[03:04:30]  and comic Kevin Hart  demanded $75,000 each  for a campus show.  Why are they,  first of all,  why are they giving away  Aziz's and fucking  Kevin's fucking money?  And how the fuck  did either one of them  get that much money?  Kevin draws big,  they draw fucking massive, dude.  Aziz is getting  75 gigs of...  75,000?  Wow, wait.  Who cares if Snooki  comes to your school  and talks?  Exactly.  People want to go see it,  whatever.  I'd never begrudge  someone fucking  getting that kind of money.  I'd love to have it.  Let's go to Jimmy 
[03:05:00]  in Staten Island.  Jimmy!  Hey, what's up?  Jay Morris,  I love you, man.  You're the fucking best.  You legendary.  I'm gonna get you  pregnant, Jimmy.  I love you, Jay Morris.  For better or worse,  fuck that bitch,  this is worse.  I would love to volunteer  on Wednesday  to come up  and just get you guys coffee,  that's first and foremost.  I'd be a coffee bitch  for the whole night.  Well, you'd have to get  through Billy Hayes  and Kenny.  I don't know this man,  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't need him  to get coffee.  He'll understand,  believe me.  What's this, Jimmy? 
[03:05:30]  Jimmy, I don't know you,  I don't know what you do,  but you're very talented  and I'm never wrong  about these things.  Thank you very much, Jay Morris.  Jay, I love what you  know, Tracy Fulker's story.  What's that from?  Jimmy, hold on.  Are you fucking coked out?  Relax.  We'll get to you, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you gotta come up  to Foxwoods Friday.  You coming?  Yeah, I'll come Friday.  I'll bring Moose Lean.  That's my wife.  Yeah, I'll bring her.  What do you call her?  Moose Lean?  I call her Moose Lean.  She's Moose Lean  with kids, my wife.  Really?  She's fucking ruthless,  but what do you got to do?  That's what you call a Moose  who's got one leg 
[03:06:00]  shorter than the other ones.  Weenie.  What's it going?  What do you got, Jimmy?  Jimmy.  I heard a story  about Joe Pesci.  He got Lippia Vegas  and some wise guy  smacked him in the face  and says,  you may play one of the movies,  but you ain't one in real life.  Who's this?  Joe Pesci.  I don't know.  Where'd you read that?  I got it from a Negro.  That's where you got it.  I never heard that story.  Where'd you get that story from? 
[03:06:30]  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Negro.  Jesus,  that kind of worked.  It's in the hole.  All right,  so you heard it  from some guy.  Yeah.  It's a pretty reliable source.  Pretty reliable.  He's got a pretty reliable source.  So what,  Pesci got Lippie  and the wise guy  smacked him  and said,  you play one of the movies,  but you're not one?  How long ago was this, Jimmy?  Yeah.  A couple years ago.  So the guy smacked  the old actor in the face?  I'll tell you why  this story isn't true. 
[03:07:00]  There's no way  Pesci was in Las Vegas.  He doesn't leave his house.  Okay.  Okay,  so then the guy's  a jerk-off face.  All right.  A jerk-off face.  So,  top five Beatles songs, Jimmy.  You got your list?  I certainly do.  Finally.  Hold on,  I'm showing you  the fucking part of Caligula  that fucking auto-referenced.  Here's mine.  It's the best.  I went last.  I'll go first.  Don't Let Me Down,  number one.  Do you want to do the Caligula?  I'm only showing you  the second.  What do I care about Caligula? 
[03:07:30]  Because I want you to see  where those reference came from.  When it's ready,  I'll be in it.  I'm not going to fucking  have dead air.  It's right here.  Why not?  We have plenty of dead air  on this show.  There's nothing wrong with it.  All right,  we're now...  Oh, it's not yet.  It's going to take a minute.  See, stupid.  Write your list.  They're walking?  Don't Let Me Down  is my number one  all-time Beatles song.  I got it on my list.  Walrus?  I got it on my list.  I know you do.  That's a good one.  Strawberry Fields?  Not on my list.  You don't smoke pot?  No, I don't.  Happiness is a Warm Gun?  Maybe soon, though. 
[03:08:00]  Don't have it on my list.  It's three different songs, man.  It ends like a fucking  shot on our song.  Rocky Raccoon.  That's fucking  Ruby Tuesday shit.  Yes, that's terrible.  That's Ruby Tuesday shit, Billy.  Billy fucking doesn't know.  Billy fucking Hayes.  I have some fucking  fuck you.  Fuck Michael Jackson.  You fucking had me bad  with the Ruby Tuesday  and then you come up  with Rocky Raccoon  as one of your  top five Beatles songs?  Rocky Raccoon stinks.  What are you talking about?  He left the room  and gave Gideon back  his Bible?  He came in  for a fucking shootout. 
[03:08:30]  I'm sure it's well-written,  but it's just not a good song.  He was drinking  Cum with Hova.  Somewhere in the  black mining hills  of Dakota  there lived  a young boy named  Rocky Raccoon.  One day  it's warming right on.  It's a good song,  but it's not a good song.  For me.  I love how it's written.  The last one is tough.  Paul singing  to try to sound like John.  That's McCartney?  Fucking Paul, bro.  He just taught me  something today.  Here you go,  right here.  Listen. 
[03:09:00]  Well, now that sounds like Paul.  Yeah, but he was  trying to sound like John.  I know, I got it.  Just to be a dick.  I figured it out.  The last one is tough.  And sit on the fucking floor  like an idiot  while Paul did all the work.  All right.  Go to YouTube  and pull up Paul  doing helter-skelter  acoustic  while John sits  on the floor  tripping balls  with Yoko  waving his arms around  in slow motion.  Really?  Pull that shit up.  Paul McCartney,  Helter-Skelter rehearsal.  He's got a fucking  lefty guitar  and he's going  do-do-do-do-do-do.  Turn this shit off. 
[03:09:30]  This song sucks.  You fucked it up.  That's your Ruby Tuesday.  No, my Helter-Skelter instead.  That's your Ruby Tuesday.  Was that?  No.  On my list,  I'm taking off Rocky Raccoon  and I'm putting Helter-Skelter.  All right,  but what do you want  Danny to find?  I want him to find  Helter-Skelter,  Paul McCartney rehearsal.  All right,  here's my list.  Yesterday,  Let It Be,  In My Life,  Day in the Life,  and Across the Universe.  You have one  non-homosexual song.  They're all fucking  great tunes.  A Day in the Life  is the only one  where you ejaculate 
[03:10:00]  semen into a vagina.  Fucking In My Life  by Lennon is Phenomenon.  Yeah, what's wrong  with Across the Universe?  That's on my list.  It's a great tune.  In My Life is a...  Out of the entire catalog?  It's better than Rocky,  Rocky Vacoon.  I got Don't Let Me,  Don't Let Me Down  Across the Universe,  A Day in the Life,  I Am the Walrus,  and Octopus's Garden,  I like.  It's either Hay Shoot  or Golden Slumbers medley.  All right,  turn this up,  and can you rewind this  and turn this up?  Look how badass 
[03:10:30]  Paul is a fucking man.  We saw him recently.  There's John on the ground  tripping balls with Yoko.  Chris Bane,  Larry Oldham.  Wow.  I'm having a book.  And there's Paul just working.  I need the answer.  You're in your lover,  but you ain't no dancer.  Oh, God,  it's coming.  They go back to Lennon? 
[03:11:00]  They shot the right one.  Do they go back to Lennon?  Because he was tripping  on the fucking floor.  He's just sitting there  doing nothing  as Paul's fucking  working out the White Album  on his own.  It's a fucking  righty guitar,  by the way.  He turned it upside down  like Hendrix.  Did you have any idea  he was that cool?  Who's filming this?  There's John.  That's fucked up.  There's John, 
[03:11:30]  just smoking a J,  hanging out.  Maybe he was taking a break.  Exactly.  A break from what?  Making the fucking White Album?  Maybe he was just taking a break.  Everyone else is working  like fucking men  right away,  right away.  You don't know the context  of that clip.  I'm breaking your balls  and you're getting  fucking fixed.  Maybe they said  let's take five, man.  Really?  And why does that video  only have 4,000 views?  That's kind of cool.  How badass is Paul?  That really shows you  the fucking...  It was an 80...  In my opinion.  It was an 80-20 relationship.  Not at all. 
[03:12:00]  How the fuck  could you say...  Night Before  is a great song, too.  Paul, 80%  of the writing  of Lennon and McCartney  was Paul.  He came up with  the concert...  He came up with  Sergeant Pepper.  He came up with  Magical Mystery Tour.  Not a sport.  Not a smart business.  Yeah, but when you  look at their fucking...  What?  Yoko owns a lot  of those songs now.  That's true.  He did give it away  to Michael Jackson,  too, that dunce.  And he fucking  married a one-legged chick  and didn't get a prenup.  He's a boob.  I got no problem  with the one-legged...  I mean, that happens  to everybody.  What I'm going to say...  What do you mean  that happens to everybody? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  You can't just go past that.  Darren,  the humor's stupid.  I wasn't putting  my flag down.  Make no fucking joke.  You know what?  What do you mean?  You got me.  You got me.  You got me.  Everybody marries  a one-legged chick  without a prenup.  Come on.  I mean,  you got me bad.  Bullshit.  What the hell  literal up?  You got me bad.  What were you saying  after that?  How fucking long  did it take you  to get that stupid...  Well, sorry. 
[03:13:00]  It's 3G.  What do you want me to do?  I don't have Wi-Fi in here.  I don't know what any of that means.  Why don't you have the Wi-Fi?  No, I do,  but I'm not using it.  I'm using 3G.  Paul McCartney,  80% of the shit was Paul.  I don't know enough  to argue that point.  In my life,  it's a great tune.  There are places  I remember  all my life.  Why are you singing it  like Reginald Van Gleeson?  Because that's the way  I sing.  It's good and coffee.  We got Tracy Morgan  checking in today.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva. 
[03:13:30]  Tracy Morgan,  what's up, Tracy?  Yo, Paul McCartney's my uncle.  That's right.  Yo, Jay,  I just want to tell you, man,  you do a great impression of me.  No word.  That's my word.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yo.  Yo, you want to say something  or you're just going to say yo?  Horace Grant  is my biological father.  Oh, shit.  With a doodoo pair,  but that's right.  Big girl wearing gold shoes  with the blue carpet  like Richard Pryor in concert.  Jay, Jay, I'm just...  Yo, Stedman,  holler, Sted.  Stedman,  holler at me. 
[03:14:00]  Yo, listen to me.  I'm not down with the big girls  no more.  I like the skinny girls,  the white girls,  like that Brooklyn Decker.  Oh, shit.  I'll throw two shots  in that bitch.  I regulate all shades.  Regulators.  Mount up.  Yeah.  This is, by the way,  a fantastic fucking  Tracy Morgan impression.  Is this Craig?  That is...  No, this is Dave  from New York.  Yo, you do the best  Tracy Morgan.  You know what?  Dave, you better  fucking really get Tracy there.  Dave, I think yours is better.  Do Tracy again, Dave.  Oh, what you want  to talk about, little Jimmy? 
[03:14:30]  What you want, baby?  That's a good Tracy.  Not bad.  I do a good Tracy, too, though.  Quick story, quick story.  I work...  Yeah, Tracy Gold.  I couldn't say it.  I got a quick story.  I got a quick story.  I couldn't say it.  I'm a restaurant.  I'm a chef.  Sorry.  And my name is black.  What?  Okay, but...  Hold on.  Wait a minute, Tracy.  Sorry.  I couldn't get Tracy Gold  out without laughing.  Who's Tracy Gold?  Who's fucking growing pains.  Oh, I don't know who she is.  Fucking... 
[03:15:00]  My Tracy Gold!  That's what I thought you did earlier  with that name  that you couldn't think of  at the last second.  Susan Boyle, but I got it.  Yeah.  I'm so fucking pleased  with my Tracy.  I'm so fucking pleased  with my Tracy.  I'm telling you.  Yo, Tracy,  you my man right there.  That's Tracy.  His real name is Dave,  but he's got a legendary impression.  You got to give him the bath phone.  That's right, J. Morris.  You got that, baby.  Dave, what was that story?  Very funny story.  Yeah, go.  Funny fucking story.  Okay, so I'm a chef. 
[03:15:30]  He's watching TV.  My GM is like  blacker than fucking Patrice.  Okay?  What's that?  He acts like the one  piece of motherfucker  in my life.  So one day,  I started doing it  after I heard  your impression of it.  I started doing it  and I did it  the whole day  during brunch  and he comes up to me  and he goes,  Dave, what's he doing?  I'm like,  what do you mean  what am I doing?  I go,  that's racist.  I go,  what do you mean  it's racist?  I go,  because I happen  to do an impression  of a comedian 
[03:16:00]  who happens to be black  and he's like,  well, it offends me  and then I just  go in for him.  I go,  because he called  one of our brothers  and he shaved his head  and he's like,  oh, so James,  he's saying that's racist  but I wasn't racist  when you called time.  It's in the hole.  Holy shit.  You know what  would be the funniest  thing Bill Murray  ever said?  In the hole, yeah.  It's in the hole.  You got that scene there.  I never liked Bill Murray. 
[03:16:30]  You found your scene, Jimmy?  Yeah, but I don't know  if they cut the part out  where the kid gets killed.  How do you cut it out?  It's a movie.  I know that,  but I must say  that Guccione did it.  Am I in it?  That's when it gets cut out  when it's me.  Scrotum.  Wow, Jimmy,  this is riveting.  Hey, I'm not saying  I'm the YouTube kid.  I'm not very good  at finding YouTube.  Mr. Blonde?  What's this?  That's from L.A.  Yeah, we're going to find out.  Mr. Blonde from L.A.  He heard we were talking shit  or Jay was talking shit.  Somebody was talking shit. 
[03:17:00]  Mr. Blonde.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  I told him not to touch  the fucking arms I did.  If they hadn't done  what I told him not to do,  he'd still be alive.  It's just a second,  but this is what Otto was doing.  You turned it into  a goddamn shooting gallery.  Hey, look.  That's what Otto was referencing,  just that moment.  Wait.  Dude, you're going to talk shit  about me, you little pring.  Sir, you messed me up.  All right, you messaged me up.  Oh, for the love of Pete.  Thank you.  They didn't really show it.  No, hold on.  They did all shit.  They show it pretty.  There's the kid. 
[03:17:30]  He grabs us.  Jesus.  That's what he was referencing.  And I knew it in the moment  what he was referencing.  Fucking Otto will be here  tomorrow with George.  Otto and George on Twitter.  That's what he was referencing  is that fucking little blonde head  bouncing off that fucking step.  Did he like that movie, you think?  Caligula?  He loved it.  It was great.  He loved it, right?  It's great.  He only ruled it for four years.  Oh, my God. 
[03:18:00]  It's a great...  Worth every moment of that wait.  That's a great fucking death scene  when the whole family is slurred.  They should have shown it  with a dummy,  just a fucking full baby dummy  getting smacked down.  Well, they fucking were pretty brutal  and his killing is very brutal.  There's some great stuff  in that fucking movie.  The cock getting cut off  and fed to the dogs.  Caligula rules.  Get the X version.  There's an R version.  I'm probably not going to watch it.  I got...  Why?  Because, you know,  I got Harry Potter 7  back at the hotel.  Oh, come on now, Jay. 
[03:18:30]  Let's call it a day.  What?  I didn't mean to end  on the Caligula murder.  Let's take some calls.  What about Butch?  Yeah.  This is my son, Butch.  Let's talk to Jeff  in Sacramento.  Jeff, long time, first time.  Hey, is it everybody?  You're not out of it, folks.  He lose four games  in the best of seven series.  Let's go to Butch  in Connecticut.  He wants to talk about  the Paul is dead documentary.  Have you heard about this one yet?  Some people think  it's hilarious.  Oh, in Keith Richards' book,  by the way,  he talks about being in his house 
[03:19:00]  in Turks Caicos, I think.  Right.  And he looks out at the beach  and fucking Paul McCartney's  walking by.  He didn't know they were neighbors.  And they smoke grass together.  They just sit there  and roll joints.  And because Paul's a lefty,  Keith in his life  never sat across from somebody  and could copy their hands  because he always sat  with other righties.  So we had to sit alongside them  and try to peek.  Right.  But with Paul right across from him,  there's some Beatles song  like Help,  something he was just obsessed  with the chord progression.  Right.  And they just sat there  and smoked grass all day  and just fucking played 
[03:19:30]  across from each other,  like knee to knee.  And I thought,  I always thought Paul was pretty,  we know Keith is cool,  but I always thought Paul  was way cooler  than he ever got credit for it.  But the fact that he's fucking 67  rolling fucking joints,  put it over the top,  like that's fucking cool.  So what,  Keith just couldn't learn Help?  It wasn't Help.  It's some song where he just,  it was always enamored  by the chord progression  and changes.  And also in Keith's book,  the reason you can't pick up  a guitar and play like,  you can't play Start Me Up,  like it's weird, 
[03:20:00]  like if you know  how to play guitar.  Keith doesn't have a sixth string,  he's taking the bottom string  off of all of his guitars.  Why?  Because fucking,  he can get more shit done.  That's why when you pick up  a guitar at the guitar shop  and try to do,  it just sounds stupid  and not.  Correct.  Fuck.  But when I heard about Paul,  I used to play that.  When I heard Paul,  on Skin Flute maybe,  probably with a penis  in your mouth humming.  It's bullshit.  Why'd you leave the bathroom  before?  Because your fucking shit  was horrendous.  But I wasn't shitting,  I only went in there  for a blowjob. 
[03:20:30]  Somebody was shitting  and it stunk.  It was me.  I know it was.  It was bad enough.  I have horrible anal  ass problems with my colon.  I've been going to  an acupuncturist, Jimmy,  I swear to God,  it's like you're doing  the real people.  I think he's putting  the needles in the wrong place.  Oh, I went to the acupuncturist  for my sperm count.  And then I've been going  for like a month  and a month in  the Chinese lady goes,  Hey, is your ejaculate?  Do you have strong ejaculate?  Like she asked me  if my ejaculate was strong.  You said no?  And I've only seen that  in fucking movies  that, you know,  lead to people 
[03:21:00]  jizzing all over something.  I have a good  fucking load shot.  You do?  Poof.  I have the libido  of like a fucking  seven-year-old man.  I'll fucking cum sometimes.  My wife's every day.  Sometimes it just  bubbles over my knuckles.  Like when I try to show off,  it just fucking humiliates me.  But when I'm fucking  by myself and I'm edging,  when I'm edging  for a while,  like I get close,  it's not.  Stop.  Fucking,  a lot of times  when I cum  it will hit me in the face.  What do you want? 
[03:21:30]  Fucking confetti  to come down?  Tastes like buttermilk  and Clorox.  It is disgusting.  Is it more Clorox  or more buttermilk?  It's bleachy.  I do have,  I think I have a photo  of myself looking  out of my hand.  I did videotape it once.  Picture it didn't happen.  Let me see.  I don't know  if I have it on this phone.  Opie,  how strong are you  or ejaculate?  Very strong,  J's mores.  Really?  How's your libido?  All day,  every day?  Real good.  Are you a far comer?  I can come pretty far,  but not when I'm fucking,  when I fuck,  I pull out others.  Not hitting myself 
[03:22:00]  in the face,  certainly,  but way more  than fucking  bubbling over the head.  You look like  an Israeli woman.  That is just  so fucking gross.  That's you licking  your own cum?  Yeah,  it is.  What made you say,  get a photo of this?  I took,  well,  there's a screen  cap of a video.  Is that the Grand Canyon  right behind you?  And why only 10,000 views?  That's something  that should be seen  by the people.  I guess it's...  What do you want people  to watch?  Paul McCartney  doing writing  Helter Skelter?  Yeah.  Jimmy licking...  They should be watching  both things.  They really should have more. 
[03:22:30]  There should be a lot more.  Can we pull Paul up again  doing...  I mean,  how fucking amazing  was that?  It's okay.  Yeah,  as we get the plugs in  because we're getting out of here.  I'm going to be at Foxwoods Friday.  Foxwoods on Friday.  Go.  You're coming back  sometime this week.  We'll take advantage  of the fact you're in town.  I got a corporate show Thursday.  I don't know about this week,  but definitely next week.  All right.  Are you here next week?  Are you guys on break or something?  I don't want you guys  doing that big trick  where you let me come up  and there's no one here.  No,  we might do a couple things  next week.  We got to figure it out.  And Jimmy's going to be  at the Funny Bone in Columbus.  My first trip to Columbus ever,  so don't humiliate me, 
[03:23:00]  Friday and three shows Saturday.  Call it CBUS.  They like that.  And go to  antisocialcomedy.com  for fucking tickets  to the Antisocial Network.  It's going to be in Vegas  July 3rd  and a couple other places.  D.C. and Chicago.  Yeah,  you got to check out  this video today.  Beatles,  Helter Skelter,  Rehearsal.  All just working it out  and John in the corner  just tripping his balls off.  But I think it was  just a coffee break.  No,  you don't.  I do.  Look at the songs  he wrote after,  though.  Wings didn't write songs 
[03:23:30]  that were like fucking  Imagine or We All Shine On.  Lennon had better solo stuff.  Sir,  Wings,  excuse me,  Wings wrote some great songs.  They're okay.  I never loved Wings.  Band on the Run?  Exactly.  Awful.  It's okay.  Fucking,  as tears go by over here.  Band on the Run.  Where you going?  As tears go by.  Look at the teeth  on that fucking scumbag.  Yeah,  it really is horrendous.  Ali Abdul-Sahalai.  fucking Omar Sharif.  Brushes his teeth  with fucking something  that makes his teeth yellow. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah,  something big.  Let's get out of here.  Maybe a yellow paintbrush  or something.  Whatever,  I'll get it later.  Thank you,  Jay Morris.  Foxwoods Friday.  We'll see you soon.  Fun as hell.  Jimmy,  if you want to reach me  on Twitter,  don't.  All right.  And if you want to reach me  on Twitter,  and tomorrow,  Otto and George  and Patrice O'Neill,  I believe.  You know,  Jimmy's a vegetarian,  which I find hard to believe  because he's full of bologna.  I don't know how  you don't get that one.  It's a great one. 
[03:24:30]  Is that where we're going to end?  This is it.  You guys remember that song?  My bologna is a first name.  I used to go with CHIP.  Wait,  you stepped on me.  Oh,  sorry.  It's okay.  You'll be an Anthony show.  You'll be an Anthony  or the virus.  Sirius XM.  I used to go with you. 
[03:25:00]  You guys remember that song? </pre>
