<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, shifting erratically between planned segments and impromptu arguments.  The show began with a discussion about ghostwriters in comedy, focusing specifically on Chris Rock and Jim Carrey,  immediately followed by a vulgar description of Brooke Shields' breasts in *Blue Lagoon*.  This transitioned into a humorous analysis of a seemingly identical story told by Jim Carrey and Tom Hanks on *Late Night with David Letterman*.

The hosts then debated the concept of "time travel" in radio, discussing pre-recorded segments and online feeds, segueing into a comedic critique of *Inception* and *Titanic*. A significant portion focused on brainstorming a rotating guest-host segment for the show, proposing Mars, Rob Cross, and Sterniola as potential candidates.  This led to a mocking critique of a competing radio show, deriding its format and playlist choices and contrasting it with their own show’s supposedly more engaging content.

The tone turned more serious as Ronnie shared his experiences serving on a grand jury, detailing his observations on perceived biases within the judicial system regarding socioeconomic and racial disparities. This discussion, however, was interspersed with crude humor.  The segment concluded with further planning for the "Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal" rotating guest-host segment, playful antagonism between Sam and Mars, and the surprising revelation that Fez had climbed a flagpole outside the studio.

The "After O&A Live" portion of the broadcast, hosted primarily by Sam Roberts with frequent Opie and Anthony appearances,  focused on the evolving nature of the show under Sam's direction. This segment was marked by significant bickering and insults between Sam and Kenny, with Kenny repeatedly using offensive names for Sam.  Opie often defended Sam during these arguments.  Discussions revolved around various staff members including Roland, Mars, Troy Kwan, Sterniola, and Joy, along with behind-the-scenes conflicts and their differing behaviors on Sam’s show versus Opie and Anthony’s original show.

Notable guests discussed included Brooke Shields (with Sam's awkward interview question about her "yoga body" being highlighted), Weird Al Yankovic (whose interview was criticized), and Elijah Wood (whose appearance was briefly mentioned).  Other topics included Sam's celebrity sighting YouTube videos (potentially featuring Fez disguised as Robin Williams), a staff push-up contest, and Pete Dominick's conflict with Eric.  The conversation frequently employed crude and sexually suggestive humor, offensive ethnic slurs, and derogatory comments about physical appearance and sexuality.  The broadcast concluded with a discussion of Ryan Dunn's death and the reaction to the news.  Throughout, the show was characterized by substantial arguing and insults exchanged among the participants.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You know it.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  And look who's still here.  There's no more.  Your mics aren't on.  I don't have control over them right now.  Look who's still here.  Oh, thanks, Sam.  Go for it again.  Do you have a Facebook?  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Roland.  And if Club Soda Kenny is here, you know what that means. 
[00:00:30]  That means that the boss hasn't given him permission to leave, which means the boss is still here.  Why do you make me sound like an asshole, Sam?  Well, you're Kenny's boss.  He's your, like, whipping boy.  And why does the 10 o'clock hour not sound like an Opie and Anthony show anymore?  It's not an Opie and Anthony show.  You tricked the bosses.  Well, they gave me the slot, right?  And all of a sudden, I'm like, wait a minute.  10 o'clock hour is technically our time still.  But I'm listening to Sam and Ron do an interview with Weird Al Yang. 
[00:01:00]  Like, they're booking guests, and they're not even talking about Opie and Anthony anymore.  Look.  You're kind of brilliant.  Thank you for saying that.  Because you got in the back door.  You're like, no, man.  I'll, you know, I know the guys want to do a little less radio.  And, you know, no, I'll keep it going.  I'll play some bits and talk about O&A.  Yeah, I said that.  And it'll be great.  And they agreed to that.  And now it's basically your show now.  Well, but you and Ant are on the show all the time.  You're obviously enjoying it. 
[00:01:30]  So as long as you and Ant are happy.  I'm not saying it's bad.  Right.  It just has become something completely different.  And they didn't see it coming.  Like, I didn't have this in mind all along.  Like, Ronnie is like us.  He doesn't want to do more radio.  But he comes in.  Yeah.  Because it gets him away from Fez for a little while.  I don't know what his motives are.  You know, he gets to kind of, like, do something a little different.  Yeah, everybody likes to do different things.  I'm doing something a little different right now.  I mean, you wanted to leave early today.  I did.  And I've officially kept you here past 10 o'clock. 
[00:02:00]  I did.  But we didn't want to blow off the Brooke Shields interview, who I'm just amazed she's a friend of the show.  And I'll say this.  Did you like my yoga body question?  Yeah.  I was trying to go for awkward.  More uncomfortableness.  Why?  You're all right.  Hey, sweetie, that yoga's really working for you.  Did you see the yoga arms on her, though?  She was looking great.  Fucking well-defined, but not that Madonna ridiculousness.  No, she was looking fabulous.  Just a little, little, little definition in the arms.  At 6 o'clock, all the yoga girls are on the up west side. 
[00:02:30]  What?  6 p.m. or a.m.  6 o'clock.  What?  All the yoga people walk by the juice place.  Yeah, man.  Like, she, I was trying to not tell her which juice place, because now they know where she does yoga.  Were you, I'm surprised you didn't make some kind of comment about her wearing yoga pants,  because I know you're a fan of the yoga pants.  What's wrong with, uh, yoga pants?  I didn't say anything was wrong with that.  You don't have to get defensive.  I'm just saying I know that that's something about you.  You enjoy a good pair of yoga pants on a lady.  I absolutely do.  The toe.  Well, what do you enjoy besides wrestling? 
[00:03:00]  What, why would you get defensive?  What, do you enjoy wrestling pants?  I can't enjoy yoga pants?  I'm not attacking you.  It seemed like you were attacking me.  I was pointing out something that you liked.  Kenny, was he attacking me?  Who, prick face Sam?  Sam's just, uh, Sam, uh, Kenny's just staring at you, and that's the first thing he said.  Well, Kenny, that's because he's stupid, right?  He's staring at me, and there's just wind passing through his ears.  Oh, wow, that's really brave of you.  Yeah.  Good one, prick face Sam.  Say that on the sidewalk. 
[00:03:30]  Why would I say it on the sidewalk?  Because you're protected by Sirius X Sam when you say shit like that.  Well, with a live mic on.  I wouldn't just...  Now, let's march outside, and you say the same thing to Kenny, and see what happens.  I'm not going to attack Kenny off the air, because it provides no enjoyment to the listeners.  That's who I do this for.  Someone sounds like who?  The listeners.  Roland, I was going to say, we should give credit to where credit is due, and realize  that there were two A-list celebrities on this radio show today.  Mm-hmm.  Roland bookings.  Way to go, Roland. 
[00:04:00]  But I would say, way to go, Opie, for approving them.  You know how to play the game.  You see what the common denominator is, Sam?  What?  What?  He's eyeballing you, Sam.  What are you mad about?  He's got issues with you.  He talks about you every day on the way home.  Did you hear yesterday how he belittled me yesterday on the show, too?  What'd he do?  He just told everybody I was a disgrace.  Even doing commercials, too.  Well, I mentioned that Kenny had left his former position of employment in disgrace. 
[00:04:30]  Why would you do that?  That's a touchy situation.  I saw it in the newspaper.  Made my wife cry.  Did she?  Yeah, they never recovered from that.  And he was bringing up his fodder?  I saw it in the paper.  I didn't think it was private information.  What, a new article?  No.  Yeah.  Don't focus on the positive like my son getting Airman of the Week.  Right.  I didn't know he got Airman of the Week.  Yes, you did.  If you were to ask questions, you would know that Kenny's son got Airman of the Week, and  there was an article about it.  What good is going on in your life right now? 
[00:05:00]  Nothing.  Something.  That was a good thing that was happening.  He just said nothing good is going on in his life right now.  No, no.  He's proud of his son.  My therapist wants me to be very positive, so I am.  I am being more positive.  And are you really seeing a therapist?  What did I just say?  Get this shit out of your ears!  That's not positive.  How long have you been seeing a therapist for?  What's the difference?  Next question.  It's something that's interesting to the listeners.  What motivated you to see a therapist?  I'm fucked up.  Why does Sam get all the exclusives? 
[00:05:30]  Kenny's going to the therapist.  Nobody knew this.  I knew for a long time.  I was just wondering if we were ever going to bring it up on the show.  Well, what you do is you lead people to admitting things about this stuff.  Why did you give him that info when you could have done it for the boys?  I led him to it.  Well, Prickface has a way of bringing the best out of people.  Thank you.  You get so annoyed that you just give up information?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Prickface?  First of all, that's not my name.  Oh, Prime Time.  Same difference.  And why weren't you brave enough to bring it up with Weird Al that we kind of beat him 
[00:06:00]  up recently?  Yeah, he's not brave.  You should have heard the shitty interview you did with the mob wife, still.  Because I'm not going to invite people into the studio when it's under my watch and say,  hey, by the way, you know who doesn't like you?  Like, that's just a rude thing to do to somebody.  But you're at the connection of the O.B. and Anthony show, which beat him up for over  an hour.  But now I feel guilty because I respect Ronnie B.  And Ronnie was talking, I was listening yesterday, and Ronnie was talking about how quick Weird  Al is because he got an unmasked with him.  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  And Ronnie actually said Weird Al was one of the quickest guys he ever interviewed.  Yeah.  He said he was quicker than a lot of the comedians.  Really quick as far as, you know, coming up with funny lines and stuff.  And I went, damn it, man.  We had it all wrong with this Weird Al.  Did you hear Eric's James Blunt question?  Oh, why would I?  He's literally, when I'm talking to Weird Al, and I'm saying, well, most people, you know,  your parodies aren't vicious.  I'm surprised when people have problems with you.  While Weird Al is answering, Eric says into my headphones, James Blunt's song.  As if I know anything about what he's talking about. 
[00:07:00]  Did he beat up James Blunt pretty bad, honestly?  I guess he made a song called You're Pitiful and Atlantic Records instead of You're Beautiful.  Right.  And Atlantic Records didn't like it.  So, at a concert that Eric went to, Weird Al put a t-shirt on that said, Atlantic Records  sucks.  Ooh, that's edgy.  But I'm supposed to know that, because I was sitting with Eric at the concert?  Like, why wouldn't Eric ask the question himself?  Yeah, why doesn't E-Rock ask questions?  Because it's not my show.  You get to be, it's everybody's show.  Technically, it's not Sam's show. 
[00:07:30]  Technically, it is Sam's show.  No.  I mean, no.  You've made it your show.  Technically, it's not your show.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's keep the facts straight.  I was told it's his show.  What did Jeff Berlin say right before we got on the air?  Technically, it's everyone's show.  Here's your host, Primetime Sam Roberts.  That's what Jeff Berlin said.  But you just snuck that in there.  Jeff Berlin did it.  He's the voiceover.  Yeah, I snuck that in there.  Well, I mean, I don't...  Look, I would do the same exact thing, but the facts are, it's technically not your show.  You made it your show.  Technically, it wasn't designed to be my show, but technically, it has become my show. 
[00:08:00]  I feel like I had to stay late today, just so people know that this hour is still connected  with the Opie and Anthony, you know, show.  Loosely now.  Very loosely.  Very loosely.  Like, first of all, it's a guest we would never book, although now I feel guilty that  we didn't talk to Weird Al, because I think we blew it on that one.  And then you also got a co-host, this Ronnie B guy.  Yeah, Ronnie B.  And there's no O and A bits anymore.  Well, we played a bit or two yesterday.  And then you get a different Roland.  I'm like, who's that guy?  Well, because we...  Because when Roland comes on our show, he's a very different, timid Roland. 
[00:08:30]  He's a wise-ass on your show.  I hate to be the guy to tell you this.  Then don't.  People are very stressed...  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  People are very stressed out coming in this studio from 6 to 10, and they're not stressed  out coming in here from 10 to 11.  Oh, name names.  Troy Kwan, who works here.  Troy Kwan brings goodness to the show.  He told me that he gets...  I'm getting a lot of props on Troy Kwan later.  Yeah.  His stock is a rising.  Yeah, he's been doing great, but he's very stressed out when he comes in here. 
[00:09:00]  Sterniolo and...  Sterniolo.  Sterniolo and Joy.  And that's, by the way, Sterniolo is a star that was first discovered on After Open  I Know.  I know.  I know that.  But that's what we bring everybody in.  We see what we get out of people.  Did you get him on the air yet to talk about the latest push-up contest?  Yep.  I got him on...  Yesterday?  Yesterday.  No, no, the day before yesterday.  He's out of his mind, right?  He went crazy on E-Rock.  He started screaming at him all over again.  Once again.  Oh, also Pete Dominick called Eric an idiot.  Oh, yeah.  Pete Dominick.  I told him during the afternoon.  He's not here yet.  But he started yelling at E-Rock in the hallway about what an idiot he is. 
[00:09:30]  And I apologize for being obsessed with this, but it amazes me that the kid won't do  18 push-ups for $180 and then $10 for every push-up he does after 18.  Like, who wouldn't take that bet?  Beyond that...  I can do two.  I would try.  I still try.  Beyond that...  Who the fuck wouldn't do that?  You offered him $1,000 for 30 push-ups.  Well, that's off the table.  I'm not messing around anymore.  But he still said no.  By the way, I'm in training.  For what?  To take out Mars. 
[00:10:00]  MMA?  No, Mars says he could do 60.  I'll wake him up.  Mars.  Mars.  Mars is in...  Another shot from rolling.  Another shot from rolling.  No, Mars starts his fiesta at what?  10?  Siesta.  Oh, fiesta's what?  Party.  Thank you for the introduction, Gordito.  Whoa!  Gracias, pendejo.  Cabral, piche madre.  Pendejo.  Pendejo.  La ramputa.  Oh, shit.  You want to know what's really going on behind the scenes?  You guys could do that?  Yeah.  I want to hear more of that.  Let me tell you, su padre's un malicón con mi pipi. 
[00:10:30]  See, he doesn't even know how to speak Spanish.  It doesn't make sense.  I can do it, too.  Taco Bell.  You want to know what's really going on behind the scenes?  Mars has picked up on the fact that whether he's in studio or not, every time his name  comes up, Roland takes a shot at him.  And it's gotten under Mars' skin on a legitimate level, not just in good humor.  He's annoyed that Roland keeps taking shots at him.  I'm going back at him in humor, and on the show, I'll go back at him outside.  But you don't like that when you're not in here, he's still taking shots at you. 
[00:11:00]  I'm used to it now.  But you don't like it.  I'm used to it.  He doesn't.  I didn't do that.  Where's my wallet?  But anyway, Mars, why do you have a problem with everybody here?  He does end up with problems with everybody.  Who the fuck says that?  You have a problem with Roland.  They're talking behind your back.  The other day, you said Jim was peer pressuring you.  You got a problem with everybody all of a sudden.  Anyway, getting back to the push-ups.  Avoid the topic.  Avoid it.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.  Can you move your phone this way?  Can you make snag it?  It should be, I do 60 push-ups before I stop. 
[00:11:30]  Wait, you can do more than 60?  Yeah.  Can you do 60 right now?  No, I just finished doing 300.  Mars was in the army, Sam.  They just said I just finished doing 300 today.  You don't have a job?  The army's called St. Quentin?  Have you done 70?  My limit is 70.  I want to push 70.  I could do 90 push-ups in two minutes.  Oh, I'm done.  Without stopping?  No.  No, no.  I said I could do 60 without stopping.  Okay. 
[00:12:00]  Can you do more than 60 right now?  No.  All right.  I'm in training.  I'm officially in training.  It's going to go down one of these days.  Without stopping?  Yeah, I understand.  I did the 51.  Okay.  But I was fucking shot.  I got to get in a little more shape.  How long is it going to take you?  To get in shape?  Yeah.  Month.  One month.  I'm a little soft right now.  Okay.  It's July competition.  I can see that.  Huh?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  He's using what I say to him on me. 
[00:12:30]  I know what he did there.  Oh, brown noser is finally taking some shots.  Come on, put your own shit.  You're taking my shit and using it against me.  That's my line.  Is it?  Okay, I'm sorry.  I've said that a million times to you.  Okay.  But fair enough.  It was a good line.  Yeah.  I mean, Mars is a little chubby for an MMA guy.  Am I disturbing your guest, Sam?  Who is that?  Brooke Shields.  She should come in.  No, no, no.  We did the Brooke Shields thing.  We could get a different side of her.  Yeah, of course we can.  Well, I mean, we...  After opening up.  But what does all this have to do with my videos?  Well, it doesn't have anything to do with your videos.  Nobody was talking about them.  You know what was great the other day, G.H.? 
[00:13:00]  What, Kenny?  That big compliment Tom Papa gave you about the Central Park video.  Yeah, but Roland hinted that he told Tom Papa to do that.  You were listening?  Yeah, I picked up on that.  No.  No.  Tom Papa's sincere.  Did Tom Papa do it on his own?  He's on NBC.  Tom Papa did it on his own.  But Roland hinted.  I saw that.  Roland was pointing at himself and nodding.  Pointing at him.  I made him say that.  And pointing at his head like my great idea.  I saw what you did, Roland.  I didn't do that.  Not for Tom Papa.  For who?  What?  For who?  No, I didn't do that.  You said not for Tom Papa. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I didn't do it for Tom Papa, no.  Why did you point at your head then?  I don't know.  Did you have an itch?  He is.  Look, I'm bald.  It happens.  I still have a mess.  He is a sweaty bald guy.  My stomach itches.  My balls itches.  I don't know.  What the fuck's going on?  Can I talk to the morning mashup on this show today?  Oh, wait.  They were yelling at each other in the hallway.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Stanley was screaming at Nicole.  Because I know you don't like them on this show.  You bring them in, I'm out of here.  All right.  Well, then we'll wait.  I got a real problem with those people.  Why is that?  Because they just play hits.  Well, they have to. 
[00:14:00]  I mean, less talk, more music, right?  So then why do you need six people?  They have four.  And they do like two and a half minute talk breaks.  No, because some of them do different names and stuff.  Like, oh.  Stanley, Sack.  See?  That's just a segment that Stan does.  But that's a different guy.  No, it's not.  So he's representing two different people as one guy.  Stanley's sack is Stan's sack.  Yeah, he's black.  So why does he just say Stanley T?  No, he's taking out his sack.  So then he's Stanley's sack and he's Stanley T.  He is not the sack.  He possesses the sack. 
[00:14:30]  He dresses like his mom dresses him every morning with the big shorts and the weird things.  Wow.  I don't know anything about that.  That's what Sam said in the after show.  What are you talking about?  You're going to be a victim of a drive-by with that shit.  That's not nice.  Yeah, Roland.  Is that true, Marcy?  You know those people.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Roland is just looking to deflect whatever he can.  I see his mind working.  And when it goes to him, his eyes start moving.  And then he goes, where can I go?  Where can I go?  He's not that quick, but you can't tell.  All right.  So, yes.  My latest video. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  I'll talk about it for a second.  It might be Robin Williams in Drag in the Park.  Yes.  Dancing.  With the yellow beard?  Yes.  People said that you might have got Robin Williams doing some weird shit.  This is amazing, because you already got Barbra Streisand at the bus stop.  Yes.  That's my thing.  And now you found Robin Williams dancing in the park.  Yeah.  That is a great video.  And yes, because you're asking, it might be Fez.  But I thought it was Robin Williams.  Now that Fez is not on the Ronna Fez show, I might have caught Fez in the park.  I'm not sure if it's Fez or Robin Williams.  Yes.  All right.  Fine.  I'll talk about it. 
[00:15:30]  Where can people even see these videos?  On YouTube.  Everybody knows.  And a great person makes a great cameo in that video we're speaking of.  Who?  The dog poop?  Oh, did you like that part?  Yeah.  Okay.  Who's the cameo?  Club Soda Kenny?  You've got to watch OP Radio on YouTube.  Oh, the username is what?  OP Radio.  Oh, okay.  Did I stutter?  I was trying to get a second plug out, bitch.  Biot.  Why the attitude?  Because he's got a chip on his shoulder.  We brought you up in this business. 
[00:16:00]  Now why the attitude?  I don't have an attitude towards you.  There's a little bit of an attitude there.  That's why I came in here.  Because I heard this motherfucker mouthing off at you.  When?  Before.  Just now.  What did I say?  Look at you.  I'm mouthing off at you, dummy.  You do it to everybody.  You can learn something about loyalty through this man right there.  Thank you very much.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You should hear what he says when you're not here.  You're full of shit.  You can learn loyalty and we can buy Rosetta Stone.  Why would Mars need Rosetta Stone?  Because he's a dummy.  He don't know what the fuck he's talking about.  Rosetta Stone is how people learn Spanish. 
[00:16:30]  He already knows Spanish.  Mars, could you teach my kid some dirty Spanish?  Yes.  Because he might need a second language in this world.  Opie, Opie.  You don't want Mars around your kid.  Remember the Hispanic thing?  Oh, right.  That was only uncles.  Yeah, but you're an uncle to something.  Exactly.  So, technically, you're an uncle.  Well, uncle to their nieces and nephews.  Plus, it's like...  That's where the problem lies.  You know, you work with Mars.  Mars comes over.  Hey, it's Uncle Mars, everybody.  Uh-oh.  So, Sam, yes, it's really important that you do stay to the end of my videos because there's  always a little special treat at the end.  And the latest special treat might be a cameo from Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  That's amazing.  Yes.  I call it a little something-something.  Do you?  Kenny, what's your problem with me?  You are the one with the problem with me.  You made my wife cry yesterday.  Why did she cry?  Because you're bringing up some old stuff that no one wants to talk about anymore.  So, why?  So, don't talk about it.  Just because you ran out of time after the Weird Al interview.  Yeah.  The Weird Al interview went to the end of the show.  Oh.  Then before that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm sorry if I made your wife cry, but there was nothing to cry about.  All right.  I accept your apology.  So, fucking relax over there.  Oh, my God.  Kenny, you want to take that shit?  Who, from Madison Square Gaga?  That's what the shirt says.  It's not even a shot at me.  My t-shirt actually says that.  But why are you wearing a Lady Gaga shirt?  Because I went to the show and enjoyed it.  Because you're a faggot?  Good one.  Tracy Morgan.  Why don't you keep it up, Mark?  Is that bad? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, you're going to be fired.  Calling someone?  Yes!  Is that bad?  This is so stupid.  Have you been so stupid?  Have you turned on a TV lately?  Well, he can't read, so it's okay.  No, he made comments about it.  Did he just say, is that bad?  Wait a minute.  You really are a stupid guy.  Look, in the old days, we were allowed to do that, and we weren't even thinking gay.  But now you can't really say that shit.  Isn't that even gay?  What?  That's gay?  I mean, you could put it in the right context.  Look, we obviously still do it, and Juan is still do it. 
[00:18:30]  We don't mean anything by it.  It's just a bunch of guys talking, but the fact is, it's a rough one right now, man.  Okay, so I'll stay away from that.  We've learned something.  What do you mean by...  That might be tough for you.  What do you mean by he's a faggot?  Yeah.  Now I've got to be careful, because if I define faggot the way I was using it...  Well, how are you using it?  Yeah, how are you using it?  Let's be honest.  He's wearing a Lady Gaga shirt, and he said something like, he's a faggot.  He's a little monster, and he just... 
[00:19:00]  Kids are little monsters, too.  Well, what do you mean by that?  Look at the way he is.  He's not manly, like a real man.  But do you mean...  What, like I'm not like, I need to lose a few pounds, like Mars?  Do you mean he's gay?  Not to grow up in a pool.  Do you mean he's gay?  No, bring up the barrette in his hair.  Yeah, that shit, too.  Scrunchy in your hair?  There's no barrette or scrunchy in my hair.  There's a band that I tie it back with.  I think you picked the wrong color, is the problem people have.  No, Jess.  Look at red.  Jess said she liked red.  It's a girl's color.  Well, I don't mind that.  I mean, I'm pretty secure in my masculinity that I can pull off a red headband. 
[00:19:30]  It's bright red.  I mean, I'm sorry it's not a free t-shirt, Mars, but...  I feel sorry for Jess.  We all make...  Ooh.  I feel sorry for your nieces.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That's why they stay away from me.  Oh, what?  Okay, now he's admitting to child abuse.  Anyway.  Oh, but you want to hear a secret?  What?  Troy has heard you on the air repeatedly say, and you said it again today, that's why I bring  it up, that you're thinking about smoking pot again? 
[00:20:00]  Six years already you've been saying that.  Troy wants to smoke you up bad.  No.  Like, he said, if you ever invite him anywhere...  Jay Moore gave me something.  Dude, what did he give you?  Just an envelope.  What's in the envelope?  I don't know.  I haven't opened it yet.  When did he give it to you?  My name is doing Law and Order.  What's in it?  I don't know.  I didn't open it up yet.  Why don't you take a look?  Where is the envelope?  It's in my house.  Well, why can't we see it?  Because I don't know what's in it yet.  Troy wants to smoke you up.  It's like semi-cow. 
[00:20:30]  I got that.  Okay, I got that.  I'm not going to smoke pot with a hipster.  You don't like Troy that much?  I like Troy.  But socially...  I don't understand the hipster thing.  So socially, like as a worker...  What does that have to do with smoking pot?  He doesn't like your ideals, so he doesn't want to be that too...  And the new stuff's really strong, right?  Oh, I'd get, like, ridiculous shit.  Well, then you'd try to put it in my butt, probably.  Why would you give me ridiculous shit unless you were going to do some harm to me?  Troy, would you try to have sex with Opie if you got him high?  I would not, no.  Okay.  No.  I thought that should be addressed. 
[00:21:00]  So why are we getting ridiculous shit?  What are we doing after we got high?  Well, I don't know.  You know, because we were talking about...  What would we do after we got high together?  No, because we were talking about you going to see...  So why do I need ridiculous shit if I haven't smoked pot?  And I'm embarrassed to say this because it makes me sound really old.  20 years.  Because it's...  You were 10?  10.  Well, yeah.  17.  Wow.  It's just real good, clean, high-grade...  But if I hadn't smoked it that long, why would it matter if...  If it was ridiculous or not.  It could be shitty and I'm going to do all right. 
[00:21:30]  You can just take one or two hits, but it'll just be like a nice, clean high.  And then what do we do?  Well, because we were talking about going to a concert.  You watched cartoons.  And I said, if I ever went to a concert with Opie, I'd get him ripped.  What concert?  I don't know.  Something cool.  Like, what's...  This is going to Rihanna.  What do you consider cool?  Soundgarden?  That you're into?  Foo Fighters?  You too?  Yeah, exactly.  If Foo Fighters are playing or any band.  That's November.  That's a long time.  I'm just okay with Foo Fighters.  Troy would want to take you to some, like, electronic show or some hip thing.  Which would be fine.  Like a hipster thing.  You wouldn't dig that. 
[00:22:00]  That's a little...  Yeah, why don't you dubstep on down there?  Or Williamsburg with clothes...  I know what that is.  Or Troy would take you to Williamsburg with a bunch of clothes sticks.  Oh, like a gay club?  No.  The Williamsburg ball.  That's what they have, like, the electronic with clothes sticks.  If I don't know what the Williamsburg ball is, what do you think the status that most  of the listeners know what that is is?  Fine.  It's a hip event.  Nobody knows what that...  Yeah, but it's Brooklyn.  We're a national show.  What's wrong with clothes sticks?  Nothing's wrong with clothes sticks. 
[00:22:30]  Rave kids like clothes sticks.  If there's clothes sticks around, there's going to be some girl rubbing up against you.  Yeah.  She's probably on ecstasy.  Troy, tell them.  Yeah.  If there's clothes sticks, that means they're on the E or the ecstasy, whatever the fuck  the kids call now, and then they have to rub up against you.  Or Troy can take you to the 675 bar on Tuesday.  I didn't take a position against clothes sticks, for the record.  I mean, I'm fine with clothes sticks.  You kind of thought it was kind of wimpy and lame.  I didn't.  But the girls will rub up against you.  I'll take that into consideration next time I criticize clothes sticks. 
[00:23:00]  And if you happen to have a boner at that point, it could be a good thing.  Tell them, Troy.  Yeah, there you go.  So if you have an erection in a club and you rub it against a girl, she'll like it?  Well, if she's on ecstasy.  No, you let them rub up against you.  Yeah, exactly.  If you rub up against them, then there's going to be problems.  But you can't be on ecstasy because you won't get a boner.  So that would totally...  But you've got to go into one of these places making believe you're on ecstasy so they  feel like you're on ecstasy.  Yeah, you're on their level.  But you're faking it so that way you still get the erection.  Right.  And girls will back their shit up right into... 
[00:23:30]  Well, Troy DJs every Tuesday at the meatpacking.  Yeah.  And when Troy DJs, he gets chicks wet.  Do you?  He said there's tons of chicks at 675.  Do chicks get wet when they hear your music?  They haven't told me that they...  So you don't know...  Yes or no.  You don't know fact or fiction on that.  Exactly.  Okay.  But he said there's a lot of chicks there.  Oh, yeah.  It's a cool spot.  Troy, you're flaming.  Flaming?  Touches, yeah.  That's in reference.  Most people would take that to mean gay.  That's Mars over there giggling like... 
[00:24:00]  That's why Mars giggled.  But the fact is you're wearing a low V-neck and you got some flames popping out.  So you're flaming.  Yeah, I'm the same in heart with wings.  See what I did there?  That's the brilliance of me.  Yeah.  I got a laugh from Mars because he thought something else.  Yeah.  I said something very safe.  You know Mars is very simple, right?  Oh, quite.  Like it's not that much of an accomplishment to get a laugh from Mars.  Mars, you're kind of simple.  We know that.  He's a simple guy.  There's nothing wrong with being simple.  I enjoy myself.  Yeah.  It's easy, right?  It's easy to have a good time.  Mars, say something that'll blow us away right now.  One, two, three. 
[00:24:30]  Where'd we go?  Roland nailed you on that one, Mars.  Did he really?  Yeah, he nailed you on that one.  Yeah, you're not smart enough to understand.  Say something.  Okay, now's a good one too old.  Thank you.  Say something that'll blow us away.  Like, I can't fucking believe Mars just said that today in the 10 o'clock hour.  Blow us away with anything.  Knowledge, anything.  I got nothing for you.  Last time you were in here, you blew us away with the revelation that you touch your nieces  or whatever that was.  I don't remember specifically.  I do not touch my nieces.  We'll go forward with that though.  What's today's big thing? 
[00:25:00]  Blow us away, Mars.  And let's get this straight.  No, no, no.  We're talking about the next thing now.  The deal with the Hispanics.  Oh my God.  Not again with this bullshit.  They love their kids.  Okay?  They love their kids.  They love them so much.  They want to share their love with other family members.  Mars.  According to you.  They pimp them out.  Mars, you eat pussy?  All the time.  All right.  Talk about it.  Look, Mars, blow us away with something.  I got nothing to blow you away with.  All right.  Well, then tell us, other than KFC and Popeyes, what's a fast food chicken restaurant? 
[00:25:30]  No, well, I tell you what, man.  I don't know how the hell you're letting that motherfucker, Opie, pronounce the restaurant  name.  I don't know how you let Sam talk down to you and just like-  I don't talk down to Opie.  To all of us.  How are you going to get away with that shit?  But I'm not going to talk about it.  Have your own battle.  I will.  Exactly.  Yeah, nice try, dummy.  Yeah, Mars, you eat ass?  That might be a trick question, Mars.  I know, right?  Do you, Mars?  Do you eat ass? 
[00:26:00]  Is that too complicated of a question for you?  Uh, not just any old ass.  Do you eat ass in general?  Have you eaten ass?  Yes.  And you eat ass?  As I eat ass.  Kenny, what's the response then?  What's the response?  Mars, if a queer jumped on your back, would you let him stay or jerk him off?  Kenny, that's not appropriate for this hour.  I don't put up with that kind of talk on this show.  That was-  What the hell?  That was Club Soda Kenny, for the record, not the viewpoint of this show. 
[00:26:30]  I don't put up with that on after Opie and Anthony Live.  I don't know what year you're used to.  Mars, what's the name of the restaurant?  What restaurant?  It's not KFC, it's not Popeye's, but they do serve fast food chicken.  Pollo Tropical.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  A Pollo Loco.  No, no, no, you know what I'm talking about.  Why does he have to lean in to speak Spanish?  It's the weirdest thing.  He's not good with my technique.  He's a natural-born engineer.  But when he does English, he's got the proper distance.  But he leans in when he does his Spanish.  Like there's a kid in front of him.  Shh.  Do you ever listen to the Spanish radio stations?  They're deeper. 
[00:27:00]  They speak like this.  You know what it is, Opie?  He has no idea how these microphones work.  Which is weird for an engineer.  Oh, man, I would love to choke that little fucker out.  Choke me then.  No, I can't do it.  Exactly.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh!  Wow.  That's rough.  You're in a rough position now.  We are adults.  We communicate with words.  You're fucking mental bullies, which you are.  Well, I'm sorry if you can't keep up with me.  But we communicate with words here.  Shut the fuck up is keeping up with you?  Apparently, it's taking you this long to respond to it.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  Why do you got problems with Mars? 
[00:27:30]  I'm just picking on him today.  Plus, he won't give me the name of the restaurant.  You know what restaurant I'm talking about.  Boy, there'll be fun.  No, no, no, no.  It's American.  They're closed on Sundays.  You love them.  They come up here for Chicken Sandwich Day.  I'll say it.  Don't say it because Mars can't pronounce the name.  You know what Mars' favorite movie is?  What?  West Side Story.  Why is that?  He's cracking himself up.  He's cracking himself up.  Why?  Why is that?  Look, he's joined the party. 
[00:28:00]  Sam.  You don't even move over?  We just freed up a mic.  Wait, he doesn't even move over?  Yeah, he's going to move.  Thank you.  He's going to move over.  Let's trade.  No, it's not trading.  It's called moving out of his way.  Let him take his spot.  You know, Opa.  Ronnie, it's great to see you.  It's good to see you.  You know you created a monster with this kid, right?  Well, yeah, yeah.  He started to turn on me, too, which is wonderful. 
[00:28:30]  Well, the strange thing about it is that the feedback that I get from listeners is just hate right now.  Yeah, yeah.  And I go, well, sometimes that works because at least it's energy.  Right.  And then you can flip it.  Obviously, you bought a lot out of Goodwill yesterday.  Bring a weird Al in here.  You know, who doesn't love him?  Well, we didn't love him until I heard what you said.  I don't know if you were listening to this hour.  No, I can't.  You turned me around on Weird Al because I thought what he did was pretty easy. 
[00:29:00]  He's made a great living.  No, no, no.  Here's the interesting thing.  Yeah.  A lot of guys do that.  Right.  And he's the only Weird Al, though.  True.  But how you turned me, you said you did it unmasked and said he was one of the quickest guys you've ever talked to.  Yeah.  And I was waiting for it to be kind of a boring hour.  And he's legitimately a funny guy.  He just puts it in that strange fucking realm.  Do you think he wants to be doing more?  No.  I think he's very happy.  I think he loves it.  He's got over, like, a million Twitter followers and all that kind of shit. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I know.  Who am I to say?  Of course.  But I just always thought it was a simple thing.  That's all.  But here's the thing about it.  But it's, yeah, it is somewhat of a simple thing.  But why, for like 35 fucking years, is he the only song parody guy?  I know you've never worked anywhere without the Weird Al clone.  I think they've been in every fucking station, that guy in the Hawaiian shirt and a mustache.  What did you say yesterday?  Because he picks hit songs to redo. 
[00:30:00]  And, oh, fuck, what was the line?  It was classic.  I shouldn't have went there because now I'm fucked it all up.  No, no.  We've got plenty of time to wait for you.  I know it's going to be good.  I know it's going to be there.  You're used to waiting for people to fucking perform.  Oh, I see.  Was that my fault, too?  No, but just the fact that you bring it up goes to show the flashlight comes back on again.  And here's the thing that you don't understand, Sam.  Okay.  You're under Opie's protection, and everybody fucking sees that.  For whatever reason, Opie goes, oh, I like this kid.  Someday, you know, Opie will get hit by a truck, and people are going to come after you with knives. 
[00:30:30]  What did I do to anybody?  I'm not going to go through fucking details for you because that's what you do.  You try to bring...  It's up to you to figure it out.  Yeah.  And then that also, that would lead to me setting up things where other human beings have had their fucking feelings hurt.  And there's this...  And, again, it's nothing against you.  You're clawing your way up.  I get the whole thing.  You know, you're like, oh, I'm in over my head.  What do I have to do to make things work?  I get it. 
[00:31:00]  But, you know, it's like a junior shock jock.  I think it works out well for you.  Who do you guys have on today?  Oh, my God.  We had Elijah Wood.  Kind of starstruck.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Every once in a while, you look at one of these guests and go, holy shit.  But what is it about Elijah Wood for you?  Lord of the Rings.  And that was a masterpiece.  I can't fucking sit through it.  I don't understand.  You've never sat through Lord of the Rings.  I've tried.  I've tried.  I think all three.  I'm not an action movie guy, by the way, in general.  A lot of action in that movie.  But it's a masterpiece.  Yeah.  I don't...  You know, I think it has to do with fantasy for me. 
[00:31:30]  Like, science fiction, I'm okay with if it's science.  But if there's, like, fucking dragons and wizards and shit, I'm just like a fucking bad Led Zeppelin song.  I'm like, I don't know what to tell you.  A guy with a long beard died.  I don't know.  You know, there's darknesses come over the kingdom.  Do you watch the Lord of the Rings stuff?  Yeah, I did.  I know it's really big.  I mean, I wasn't, like, a super fan, like a Trekkie for Lord of the Rings.  But there's huge movies.  No, that doesn't...  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of...  You know what?  Right now, I just found this out yesterday. 
[00:32:00]  The number 10 movie of all time just came out.  That fucking Pirates 4.  Right.  I don't know a human being who's saying Pirates 4.  No, I can't.  Number 10 of all time?  Number 10 of all time.  It's made over a billion dollars this year around the world.  No.  It's made three times more money outside of this country than it.  I gave up on those movies after maybe the first.  I was in for the second, and then I was gone.  Halfway through the second, you ran for it, and then you're like, I don't know who.  I think that's what happened to me.  I think I did get through half the second.  And I really liked the first movie, but I have no desire to keep watching them. 
[00:32:30]  But once they got the snake face and all those other...  And the ghosts are running around on the ship.  Yeah.  What am I saying?  I don't even know what you're talking about.  I've been gone.  We were gone.  I don't know about that, yes.  But Elijah, whatever he does, he'll always be known for Lord of the Rings above anything else.  He's always welcome to Comic-Con.  That's what we were kind of thinking.  If it goes bad, he's got a career.  It's pretty amazing that he was known as the kid from all the movies.  He was known as a child star, and now he's found something else that he's known for.  What was he first known for?  I would say...  He was in The Good Son, believe it or not. 
[00:33:00]  He was Macaulay Culkin's...  So he was like tiny then.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See, here's the weird thing.  It's like a lot of...  In the old days...  I'm only talking about like 20, 30 years ago.  If you were a kid star, that was the end of you.  Right.  Now, all these people were kid stars.  Just about everybody you know has been...  You know, if they're 30, they've been acting for like 27 years.  Yeah.  It's no longer a bad thing to have been on the Mickey Mouse Club.  It's fucking neat.  Child star is not a term really anymore. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  Child star means you were really famous, and now you're a complete fuck-up.  Right.  And you don't get that anymore.  What are all those kids in the 70s?  Well, I don't think they had any training.  I think they just picked cute kids.  Right.  Where now...  Oh, good point.  Now I think it's like...  You gotta be trained.  Yeah.  They're like little fucking chess prodigies.  They're right.  You know, like, stay with it.  Do it.  Don't fucking...  You know.  No one ever thinks, all right, I'm 13.  I've made a million dollars.  How much heroin can I put in my own?  Just...  I think I can put a lot in.  That is true, because Elijah, in like 94, Roger Ebert said that Elijah Wood was the greatest 
[00:34:00]  actor of his age group, or like he was a phenomenal actor for that age.  Right.  And then he said, good, Ryan Dunn's dead.  Good.  Yeah.  Fuck Ebert.  You had every right to say what he did, but relax.  Well, it's...  How much attention you need, you gotta jump on that right away.  The thing is, everyone knows.  You don't need to fucking stay.  Yeah, we all knew what it was gonna be.  But a lot of people were, you know, severely bummed out.  Right.  It's almost like if someone's mom died, and you show up at the funeral, like, I used to 
[00:34:30]  worry.  I knew she was 350 pounds.  Yeah.  Thig or diabetes.  Yeah.  Just shut the fuck up.  Give it a day or two.  Everyone knows it.  You don't need to fucking teach a lesson to anyone right now.  At that moment.  Yeah.  There'll be plenty of time to teach your little fucking lesson to people about drinking and driving.  The funniest line is Bam, like, immediately put out, why don't you shut your fat fucking  mouth to a guy with no jaw.  Oh, it was classic.  It was just like...  Do you think he knew?  No.  Bam doesn't fucking...  I didn't think so either.  When that news came out, Bam was just fucking tattooing, you know, some skateboard across 
[00:35:00]  his arm.  Yeah.  Hey, we also had Brooke Shields in today.  How's Brooke doing?  She's, uh...  She's all right.  It got weird in here.  Did it get weird?  Yeah.  No, it didn't get weird.  I just want to acknowledge that she had a nice yoga body.  The thing for me is I'm a huge fan of hers, but that goes back to Harry and the Hendersons.  When that happened...  I saw her in the hall one day and couldn't believe how long that woman is.  You should have heard how Opie ended the interview, though. 
[00:35:30]  He said...  Because earlier in the interview, he said, I saw you on your way to yoga once, and then  that...  He just kind of let it sit there, and she was like, all right.  And then he wanted to increase the awkwardness.  Well, I was just trying...  I was going for awkward.  Yeah.  So he said...  Why are you playing my car tomorrow?  He's fucking Perez Hilton.  That's his fucking thing.  You are, aren't you?  I want...  It was on the radio.  I want you to know what...  No, but the way you're doing it...  I get it.  I like people to just go, wow, that was awkward.  I was thinking that maybe I was going for awkward.  But you said it just like 20 minutes ago.  You said you were going for awkward on the air.  That was 20 minutes ago.  Oh. 
[00:36:00]  But what are you doing with the flashlight in here, trying to say this is the way Opie  works?  Because I didn't want Opie...  Opie was about to address this, and I didn't want him to have to set up his own thing.  I don't know.  Sometimes for me, it seems it's like you feel like you're doing a director's voiceover,  and just let the words speak for itself.  Well, do you want to talk about...  I just wanted to comment about her that she looked good, because she's been doing a lot  of yoga.  That's all.  Can I explain what he means by that?  Yeah, I got it.  Okay.  He said, the yoga, whatever... 
[00:36:30]  I see you're doing the yoga.  You're doing good.  You look all right.  I said you look all right.  But he said, like...  You're looking all right.  I want to say that she looked hot.  I wanted to go for hot, and you're a piece of ass for your age, but I didn't want to  be rude.  You said the yoga's working.  I said you're looking all right.  The yoga's looking all right.  How old is she?  Does anybody even know?  It's got to be mid-40s.  Yeah.  The weird thing about Brooke Shields, when she was like, I don't know, like nine,  she did a lot of nude scenes in movies.  Pretty Baby.  And Pretty Baby, of course, is the famous, you know, like full frontal for a little girl. 
[00:37:00]  But then she did a George Burns movie where her ass was out in a fucking comedy.  Wow.  And I'm like, if this happened today, they would come and arrest everybody that was on  the fucking set.  Of course.  They don't be brought up on child pedophilia charges.  But at that time, they were like, hey, this is what you're known for, honey.  You might as well do it here for a comedy.  Or else you're out.  I felt like I was Ronnie B today when I was interviewing.  Yeah? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, because I go, hey, Brooke, do you even remember a time where you weren't famous?  And I'm thinking, that's something Ronnie B would have asked.  But then you told her she looked all right and the yoga's really working for you.  Hey, why would you have to do that?  I had a moment.  I'm sharing a moment with Ronnie B.  He didn't do a bad job.  I was basically saying, look, Ronnie, I could fucking raise the level when I have to.  And then you have to bring it back down as dopey Opie with the fucking awkward shit.  You did it on purpose.  I had a moment today where I'm like, you know what?  I think I got a good question finally.  Brooke, do you remember ever not being famous? 
[00:38:00]  You're a multifaceted performer.  Yeah, but then you had to bring it down.  This annoyance that you feel, you create it, Opie.  Because there's no reason that you couldn't take any one of your guys and have them do the fucking after show.  And they should have maybe all...  This is the payback, right?  Yeah, they should all.  Maybe Danny should do it one day.  E-Rock should do it one day.  I've invited everybody in here.  No, no.  Not invited with you.  A fucking revolving thing of hosts.  Nobody wanted to do it.  Right.  I call it brilliant on his part, though, I have to say, because this was supposed to be a show that was hosted by whoever, but he made it his own. 
[00:38:30]  That's brilliant.  And nobody wanted to host this show on our staff.  Well, now let's have another election and see if people are out there.  Because I've talked to a lot of people who would like to do it.  But, I mean, you say it's brilliant, and it's very brilliant in a Machiavellian way, like the guy behind the guy.  Like, I don't know about that.  I don't know, Opie.  But I turned this show into something that would be worth hosting, and now people might want to. 
[00:39:00]  Yes, thank you.  Thank you for what you've done.  So now you should fight for it.  I am fighting for it.  That's what I'm doing right now.  Well, we've got to, like, audition other people before you fight for it.  You can audition whoever you want.  That's what Ronnie's saying.  I say we just spin the wheel, make the deal, and make it one of those things where the people have to be in there.  Wow, spin the wheel.  Yeah.  And then every day you don't know who's going to host it.  Every day you don't know who it's going to be.  You know, some people want to host it.  Then the person who doesn't, that's really fucking funny radio.  That's brilliant.  You know, and it isn't all like, oh, let me make this about me.  Let me, you know.  I was out for one day and said whoever wants to host it. 
[00:39:30]  Nobody did.  E-Rock played bits.  That's because.  Why are they closing the curtains?  What's the big reveal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm feeling nervous now.  Ronnie, you set me up for something.  Yeah, there's going to be fucking seven guys coming in here with machine guns.  Is that what you're worried about?  Is this it?  Is this the fucking thing?  I light a match and all of a sudden guns go off.  Why are they?  Why are they?  Who?  Oh, because that's how you do your show.  I just figured it out.  Well, not at all.  Then something's going on.  Will you at least keep.  I try to make this show visual.  If something.  Fez doesn't like to have eye contact with. 
[00:40:00]  Me.  I know.  Don't be like that, Opie.  You know how he feels.  I'm going to try to.  I'm going to try to work it out with him.  I decided.  I would ask you a question, but I don't want to.  What?  Just by even saying that, though.  Well, no.  I'm not trying.  No.  See what that is?  You pick it up on it?  Yeah, because now we have to go.  What would the question be that you didn't want to ask?  We understand you don't want to ask it, but now we have to know.  We would have just said, what do you mean by that, Opie?  And you could have furthered your explanation.  Why not just let it sit?  Let it fucking simmer a little bit.  Let people that are listening to the show go, oh, God.  Can you go back to that picture?  That's interesting. 
[00:40:30]  Which picture?  You don't even know what was just up there?  I didn't put it.  It was in Naked Brooke Shields, and the little girl thing is usually not my thing, but how  old was she?  E-Rock put it up there.  He's doing it right now.  Oh.  This is it.  E-Rock actually has this on his own stuff.  Is that wrong to think that's not, Ronnie?  No, that's 1980.  That's when she did the We're All Trapped on an Island, like Lost.  Oh, that's Blue Lagoon?  Yeah, Blue Lagoon.  How old was she in Blue Lagoon?  This was probably her last naked role, so she must have been like 11, 12, 13.  That's it, right?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Well, she was always tall for her age.  Yeah, she was.  She was in length.  Her eyes are ridiculous.  I think this was the time when she was dating Michael Jackson.  She was 15 in Blue Lagoon.  Okay.  And she's 46 now.  Yeah, we figured mid-40s, although she doesn't look mid-40s, but we just figured it out because  we've known forever.  Did you see her, how bad she fucked up on the Tony Awards?  She explained it on her show.  Yeah.  She's like, fuck, I fucked it up so bad.  I was so bummed out.  She said she called her husband.  I don't know how to get out of this because she knew she was going back up on the stage.  Husband goes, go up there and curse. 
[00:41:30]  And she's like, what?  And he goes, yeah, if you curse, that's what they're going to pick up on.  And they're going to forget that you just fumbled and mumbled through that thing.  So make it worse all the time.  So now they're talking about how she cursed on the Tonys.  It's pretty smart.  It's actually...  Well, who's her husband?  I don't even know.  She used to be...  I don't know what he does now, but he's a joke writer.  Or was.  Like, he used to sell jokes to Jim Carrey for 50 bucks and Chris...  I don't know if officially Chris Rock, but a bunch of guys.  I hate to think of those guys buying gags, though, don't you? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I hate it, too.  Yeah.  I hate it, too.  Just if you've got nothing to say, don't go up that night.  What's the big fucking deal?  You are right, man.  When you find out that a lot of these major, over-the-top comics actually had jokes written for them,  I'm like, wow, why?  Who are some of the biggest that you know that have writers?  Well, I mean, when Chris Rock does an award show, he hires Rich Voss.  Well, I kind of get it for an award show, because it's such a weird thing.  Right.  But if it's just his act and he's touring around the country, I kind of feel like you want to think it's his. 
[00:42:30]  Kind of think they just go up and do their thing.  Yeah.  Well, she said her husband wrote for Jim Carrey, gave him a joke here and there.  Do you know of guys?  You know, as you ask that question, I'm not...  Because it doesn't come out in public.  No, it really doesn't.  They don't really want that out there.  It's really fucking distasteful.  So when you ask that, I'm like, fuck, I couldn't give you a list.  Yeah, it's really fucking...  Yeah, well, it's weird, because with a recording artist, they will put on there, you know, who wrote the fucking song, and then it's out front.  Right.  But, you know, if it's Jim Carrey, he should be like, you know, here's something Brooke Shields' husband said to me. 
[00:43:00]  I think it's...  If I was writing for Jim Carrey, I'd be just like, stretch that neck out a little bit.  Just a little bit.  It's fucking weird.  It's working for you.  Make it seem like your feet are on backwards.  Wow.  That had to be stunt boobs in Blue Luton.  Yeah, that's not real.  You couldn't do that.  No.  Even back then.  They're heaving boobs.  Brooke Shields' character's on her back, but you don't see her back.  Yeah, they did use stunt doubles, right?  You have to.  You have to think that.  Wow, that's a big muff underwater. 
[00:43:30]  Okay.  That was the late 70s, early 80s muff.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  That was just literally...  At first, I thought it was a blowfish, but from here.  Okay.  No, it was good.  Seriously, it was good.  All right, good.  You just didn't want to give me anything.  I'll fucking text Jim Carrey if he wants it.  I know he's doing Letterman.  I just felt like I don't want to give him anything out of that.  Actually, I saw Jim Carrey on TV the other night.  I thought he was fucking hysterical.  So he does Letterman, and he tells this long story about his dogs getting in with skunks  and all this kind of stuff, and he acts it out. 
[00:44:00]  And then Letterman says, you know, it's weird because Tom Hanks was just on the show talking  about the same thing, and they show Tom Hanks, and it was like word for word, he had captured  fucking Hanks, and Jim Carrey's just sitting there looking like he's busted and all fucking  embarrassed.  It was very, very funny.  Was it set up?  Yeah, it was all fucking set up.  Between those two, I mean?  Yeah.  Okay.  Good bit.  Yeah, it's very, very funny.  I can't believe no one's ever done it before.  That's pretty good.  Just fucking go in and lift another fucking celebrity panel.  That's really smart.  That's really smart.  Hey, before I leave, Ronnie, discussion on time travel and future shows and stuff. 
[00:44:30]  I bragged yesterday that we were the first radio show that time traveled, and I got killed  on my Twitter.  They said, well, Ronnie B's been time traveling for the last four weeks.  My answer to that was that you just pre-recorded.  No, no, no, no.  What's the difference between time travel radio, which I believe me and Anna and Jimmy did  yesterday, and what you did the last four weeks?  I think it's fucking amazing that you guys did it second.  I think that takes a lot of courage, seriously.  It takes an amazing amount of courage. 
[00:45:00]  You guys have always been good that way, of like, seeing when something's breaking and  being right there, right in the fucking pocket.  So you don't want to admit you just were pre-recording that that was some time traveling shit you  were doing before we did it?  Well, see, we were doing the news before it fucking happened, calling games before it  happened.  I don't know.  The stuff that you were doing, you were interacting with tape, right?  The online feed.  Oh, the online feed.  It was looping.  Yeah.  There was some Inception shit going on, because then it was like three or four of our voices 
[00:45:30]  at the same time, as we were still live.  By the way, have you gone back and watched Inception?  No.  The great thing about it is it gets worse and worse every time that you watch it.  Really?  It's like the opposite of Goodfellas.  Goodfellas gets better and better, obviously.  I've never seen Inception.  Really?  I loved it in theaters, but I guess...  Here's the thing.  Inception's so great.  You would fucking love it.  There's this ring that's got magical powers, and it represents everything that dragons 
[00:46:00]  have done throughout the...  It's like a dragon king who's running...  And these dwarves.  They're friendly, but somehow they're Inception.  But somehow they're mischievous.  It's a weird thing, because one of them's riding a unicorn.  It's so fucking good.  DiCaprio, which character does he play in this whole thing?  DiCaprio plays a boy who drowns on the Titanic, and it's such a...  It's a weird movie.  A lot of stuff is going on.  Well, it's everything you like.  It's fighting robots.  It's got everything.  There's a fucking Green Lantern. 
[00:46:30]  You know, we brought it up on our show, but Titanic was just a movie about a one-night  stand.  Where was the love in that movie?  Where was the love in that movie?  Love at First Sight.  Fuck no.  That was a one-night stand.  You don't think it would have survived the test of time?  No.  They fucking were on a big ship trying to get to America.  They're in the middle of the ocean, and it's a one-night stand movie.  Well, here's the thing to actually back up, and I hadn't, you know, really thought about  this before, but it's really, when you're a rich girl, it's really easy to fuck the townie. 
[00:47:00]  You know, like, hey, she's edgy.  But then to move across town, you know, fucking, nah, that's a whole different thing.  She'd actually have to leave her lifestyle and not just leave it while she's on vacation.  Right.  Let's have her grow up in Long Island and see how fucking great it is.  And no one else would let go of the fucking, you know, piece of wood there in the ocean.  And just hang out?  You'd push her off at that point.  You don't know her.  I think there was enough fucking room.  I think so, too.  Yeah, if they were both sitting on it instead of lying down.  Well, look, you're going to sit on it, the lower half of your body might get a little 
[00:47:30]  colder because a little more of it's going to be in the water.  Put your fucking feet up.  Yeah.  You should have mounted her and got on that big ass of hers and just fucking, you know,  just fucking relax.  I think we've got to kill about 15 minutes before a boat shows up here.  It's so weird.  They hired an iceberg to play that part.  Oh, I'll be.  Well, her lower half's a little big.  I know.  I know.  Kind of like what icebergs are if you see what's going on under the water.  I know, but I just meant it was hurtful.  Why is it hurtful?  She's a multimillionaire.  It doesn't mean she would like to be made fun of. 
[00:48:00]  Wish one of the other guys was hosting right now.  I don't know which one.  Mars could come in and host for a while.  Mars would be fucking great.  You would like to see that?  Yeah.  Could you do a week of this, Sam?  What, rotating?  Take Ronnie's idea.  You have nothing to do with it except spin the fucking wheel.  Yeah.  Spin the wheel, make the deal.  Of course.  And then you could be like kind of on the side there, kind of watching the whole thing.  Do it for a week.  I don't want people, I won't be on the side because then people will think I'm trying to 
[00:48:30]  make it about me.  Walk around and get a short list of people that could do it.  Okay.  Certainly our staff, but maybe Sterniola, maybe a couple of the Ron and Fez guys.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Get the short list.  Are they?  And then you spin the fucking wheel and they get that hour.  And you kind of control it a little bit to make sure it's not totally off the rails.  What about hosts from other fucking places?  There's so many of these other stations that are trying to get people to listen.  Here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Sterniola, what about the morning mashup?  What if we just got them all in here?  That would be boring. 
[00:49:00]  You wouldn't like that?  You don't like the morning mashup, guys?  Not really.  Hmm?  They play hits.  Yeah.  I have no respect for people that play hits.  Why are they playing hits if they're on a satellite?  Do we really need hits here?  No, we don't need hits.  We should be making hits.  And how easy is that gig?  Six people to play hits?  They say that it's four of them and they say that their chemistry is what makes them really special.  They play hits.  They're like the Beatles that way, though.  Yeah.  The one thing they've got to do every day is make believe they really want to play Kesha again. 
[00:49:30]  That's their whole job.  Yeah.  I mean, there's only 25 songs or so.  So they have to get up and get excited.  So it's top 25.  It ain't even top 40.  It's top 25 now.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not a lot of different songs.  What do they do?  They talk, they come up with like four or five different topics per day that might, you know, turn into, here's what happened in my life.  Let's make it a hypothetical question.  Next break, we take calls and then we move on to the next topic.  That's the formula.  So give us one of the topics so I understand.  So we can play along. 
[00:50:00]  They would say, oh, Nicole will come on and say, I told Matt to do, to take out the garbage.  And he was mad at me because an hour later I took it out myself instead of waiting for him to do it.  But I didn't think it was ever going to get done.  How long should you let your significant other?  That's a really boring relationship.  I can't comment on the relationship.  Garbage, who cares?  Why would it be a thing in a household?  Well, you have to kind of twist it into the topic to get the phones lit up, you know?  It's been about 35 minutes. 
[00:50:30]  Ronnie, is that a thing in your household?  The garbage?  No.  Yeah, it's either.  But you only need two phone calls because these breaks are two and a half minutes long.  Every once in a while I'll hear, oh, you said you're going to take out the garbage.  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  Oh, yeah, I'll do it now.  And that's it.  You wouldn't be a caller that related to that topic.  They would have to focus on the other people.  See, my side of that thing is, what the fuck did you just say to me?  Seriously, I want you to fucking say it again.  What the fuck did you just say about the garbage?  See, that's Philly coming out now. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Ronnie tries to keep the Philly down in him.  I listen enough to know that Ronnie is struggling every day with the Philly thing inside his body.  He really struggles.  He struggles with it.  That's the real Ronnie right there.  I hope he fucking gets it because for fucking people who don't have a lot, they have too much pride.  It's the one thing they have too much on.  They constantly think they're disrespected.  For no fucking apparent reason.  That's Philly.  He does this guy, Philly.  Can we get Rob Cross on the wheel?  Yeah, fine.  Can we get him hosting an hour?  Ronnie, I mean... 
[00:51:30]  Rob Cross is a very fucking skilled program director.  I know.  And he used to be on the radio in Arizona.  I forget what his name was.  It was...  Chuck Roast.  Okay, Chuck.  I almost called him Meatloaf.  And I knew that couldn't have been right.  His name was Chuck Roast.  Chuck Roast.  Yeah.  Oof.  Kid Kelly knew him back then, so he had to be somebody.  He didn't know him well enough to bring him up with him.  Well, he wasn't going to hire him.  By the way, is Kid Kelly the correct Kid Kelly that we hired?  Because there's so many around the country.  No, no, no.  He's the Kid Kelly.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  He's the guy.  What were some of those other names, Ronnie? 
[00:52:00]  Mason Dixon.  Mason Dixon was a biggie.  It's all over.  I got one.  Sandy Beach.  There were a few Sandy Beaches.  Okay.  I'll give you another one.  The guy who does the morning show over at Raw Dog.  Sonny.  Sonny Fox.  Sonny Fox.  There's a lot of Sonny Foxes.  Is there?  I didn't know that.  And Sonny Fox got, given the name Sonny Fox, the Sonny Fox that we know, not knowing that  there was a more established Sonny Fox.  Oh, no kidding.  Like at one time, program directors would just tell you, hey, I'm putting you on the air  as this.  And the kid would be like, great. 
[00:52:30]  I don't give a fuck.  You know?  Where are we at with Spider Harrison?  Is there just one spider?  Spider Harrison.  No, I'm serious.  We get a countdown.  No, I think there might be more than one.  He's Spider with a Y.  He's Spider with a Y.  Oh, Spider with a Y.  Oh, that's why he's not getting sued?  That's original.  Well, he's been Spider Harrison for a long time, too.  And I think Bubba, well, there's been Bubba somethings, but I think even they tried another  Bubba the Love Sponge.  I think Scott tried to rip it off.  Who?  Scott and Todd.  Scott Shannon, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Wasn't there like a fake Bubba on there?  Scott Shannon did fake Bubba when he took Pirate Radio to L.A.  Yeah, he did fake Bubba.  Yeah.  He started saying he was Bubba the Love Sponge.  He did it when he was at Z100 in New York, too.  They used to have their guy go out and look for bumper stickers to give you $100 if you  were listening to the radio at that time.  And that guy was always named Bubba the Love Sponge.  That's really fucked up to just feel like you can steal somebody's gimmick.  Yeah, no kidding.  Is there only one human Newman?  Yes, there is.  I hope so. 
[00:53:30]  Well, you picked the one name that we all know there's only one.  We don't know that.  That's why I asked the question.  We're positive.  Well, I'm glad you answered that.  We can't wait for tomorrow's show.  Yeah, who's going to be spinning the wheel?  I like the idea of Mars fucking in here.  Are we starting out on Friday?  Yes.  You going to do it next week?  I'll do it next week.  That's Ronnie's idea.  So today and tomorrow, you've got to figure out who's going to be in the pool.  We've got to build a wheel.  You've got to build a wheel.  Build a wheel.  We don't do sound effects.  This has to be a real wheel, not a fake production wheel.  It clicks?  Does it have to click?  Yeah, where you're acting like, oh, we're doing it, and then you pull it out of your 
[00:54:00]  pocket.  Yeah, right.  Fucking been around the radio enough for that shit.  Like a wheel of meat.  We want a real wheel that we can prove.  Okay.  Mars, you want in on this?  I want in.  Kenny, do you want in?  No.  Okay.  Kenny's out.  You're perfect.  Seriously, Kenny, I would love to fucking hear it.  Cop talk.  I would love to, but I don't work for free.  Okay.  Well, that's part of the deal.  Mars, you don't mind?  I'm in.  Okay.  All right, good.  What if we open it up to the listeners, everyone who has a podcast, which is every listener  now.  Everybody. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  We're competing with listeners now for audience.  And every comic.  The fuck, you assholes.  Every comic that you've ever had on your show has their own podcast talking to the other  comics who have podcasts.  Well, I laugh at the comics because they kind of look down at radio guys.  Look what you're doing now.  Are you in?  Look what you're doing now.  Are you in, or are you going to say to the producer?  I got to sit here and do everything else, so I can't.  Once again, Eric has an excuse for not stepping up and taking the spotlight.  Iraq, you could also play some of the tunes you love.  What was that first album you ever bought yesterday? 
[00:55:00]  He's the DJ, I'm the rapper.  Our first prince.  That was funny.  I heard that yesterday, too.  Well, then we got to find out who else is interested.  I'm sure Troy will do it, but I don't know if you want Troy.  Death metal.  I'm a big fan of Troy.  Okay, you want Troy on?  Big fan.  He's on the list then.  He's moved up.  So far, we got Troy Mars and Rob Cross.  You know what?  We should seriously, fucking every time we talk about this, we should start saying your  kisses on my list.  I was making the list.  That would be the fucking go-to song.  And Sterniolo's there, too.  Yeah.  What about Dusty Street? 
[00:55:30]  Does she get a part of this?  Who?  Exactly.  I don't know.  I think we're...  You don't know who came before you.  That's a shame.  He doesn't fucking...  He doesn't know the business.  You don't care.  I don't know.  The sweat we put into this business, you should know us.  I'm trying to learn from you.  Okay.  And learn about Dusty Street and come back with a full report tomorrow.  I just got a text that Fez climbed a flagpole downstairs, so I got to go get him down off  there.  Fez is here?  Yeah.  Wow.  Trying to make the scene today.  That's great.  Looks like he's not coming in, though. 
[00:56:00]  He's up on a flagpole.  Oh.  Out in front of the fucking 30-year-old.  Jesus.  I don't know what it means, so I got to go get him.  Hope it was great seeing you.  Yeah.  How was the jury thing?  It was horrible.  Did you really learn from that?  Yeah.  I have to come on your show.  I want to talk about it.  Are you a changed man?  In what way?  I don't know.  You saw some shit, right?  Yeah.  I saw some ugly shit, but I don't know if it changed me any.  Grand jury stuff is rough, no?  No. 
[00:56:30]  Some of it is very, very uncomfortable.  I'd have to see.  You know, I'd have to see the victims and some of the stuff that happened.  The other part of it, though, is in fucking New York, never get in trouble, because the  grand jury, I think 90-some percent of them are like, fuck that guy, whoever it is.  They're just like, hey, if the cops said it, fuck him.  So you could get in fucking serious trouble in this town.  Serious fucking trouble.  You saw the system at work.  Yeah.  Don't punch another fucking guy.  Don't punch anyone.  Because I saw people in bar fights and serious fucking shit. 
[00:57:00]  You've talked in front of grand jurors before, right?  Any grand jury, you can indict a ham sandwich.  Yeah, that's the old fucking saying.  And they would say you can indict a ham sandwich unless Ronnie B's on the fucking grand jury.  Right.  Because, and I'm going to wait like a month or two and bring in some of the guys from the  grand jury.  But we were...  Did you make friends?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I have made better friends than I do at work. 
[00:57:30]  I would imagine.  Yeah.  Mainly, it felt like you were in the Lost Island where people started to fucking depend on each  other.  But there are certain, like, I said this before, too, like, the detectives.  There's some really fucking bright New York detectives.  Some of the uniformed cops, I don't know.  That's the fucking roll of the dice.  Some of them, some of them you're like, all right, this guy.  But other guys, you're like, he's like a bouncer in a bar.  He's, you know, I don't know if I fucking trust anything, this guy is saying. 
[00:58:00]  And the DAs, they're fucking frightening.  They are fucking frightening.  So you don't want to trust the judicial system?  No, no, no, no.  No, not at all.  I want to fucking stay away from anything that happens.  Right.  Everybody should have a fucking lawyer.  I've come to figure out.  Everyone should have a defense lawyer.  Rich people do better than poor people?  White people are the best fucking people.  The number of people indicted with Hispanic last names in the island of Manhattan was alarming. 
[00:58:30]  Overwhelming.  Alarming.  Really?  Yeah.  Do they have lawyers, though?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Because there are...  This is real shit, too, man.  Yeah.  But also, to me, some of the best people that I think I've ever had the chance to fucking  see are the detectives who work in the sex crime fucking part of it.  Right.  Those guys are the shit.  They're the fucking dudes.  And when you see some ugly stuff, and then these guys come in and basically tell you, 
[00:59:00]  not only...  We got them to sign.  Don't worry about it.  And they get so many fucking people to sit down and sign.  Wow.  And you're like, why would the guy do it?  There's nothing in it for him.  You can only imagine, you know, the pressure that guy was feeling to sign.  I don't know whether they just fucking tore him around.  I would love to know the secrets.  But when those guys were coming in, the fucking deal was already done.  Don't worry about it, though.  We got this.  This is all ready.  We got this.  We're making him build his own fucking jail. 
[00:59:30]  There's like...  Yeah, there is fucking spooky stuff.  But yeah, you don't want to be poor in this country for any fucking reason.  And everyone knows that.  Yeah.  Why don't they change that?  In what way?  How would you change it?  I don't know.  It just seems, quote, unfair.  In a country where we feel like we give everyone a shot.  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, everyone does have the same thing.  Everyone gets an attorney.  But then when you have more money, you get the good attorneys.  You get the better attorney.  Right.  It's kind of like a video game. 
[01:00:00]  You get the better video weapons, excuse me, if you got, you know, points and money.  It's exactly right.  So that guy's coming in and going, well, wait a minute.  How does this blood thing work?  And you're going in, a regular fucking guy doesn't have that kind of money to figure  out, hey, what did they do in the lab?  They're just like, that lab shit is fucking cement.  You know what I'm saying?  Hey, the lab said it.  I'm like, I don't know, I guess.  Why would the lab lie?  You know?  So you really do need OJ money to fucking relax in this country. 
[01:00:30]  That's unbelievable.  I hate to break up this conversation, but we're running into Ron and Fez time.  Who are you?  Seriously.  My name's Sam.  You were the guy that used to fucking host the show before Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal  took place.  Next week is Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal.  I also want to do that same thing for the people that are co-hosting or basically the  sidekick for Dave on the Saturday Night Dave show that everybody loves.  That's up to Dave.  That would be completely up to Dave. 
[01:01:00]  Does Dave get a shot at this hour?  I can't come in.  Yeah, he's doing his morning news thing, so he's pretty far away.  I'm glad he's finally doing what he loves.  I'm so glad he finally found his calling.  News.  Radio.  He's good at it.  Have you ever heard any of the things that he's done?  No.  You've got to play one during your show.  It sounds like a man who's got a gun at his head.  He's a co-host now, though, on the show. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I didn't know that.  I thought he was just doing news.  No, he's officially the show co-host with the girl.  When can we push that girl out?  She's fucking...  I'm sure he's working on it, and I would hope that the station recognizes that she's yesterday's  news at this point.  Do they do garbage bits about not taking the garbage out?  No, no, no.  They don't go into mash-up territory.  So it's very slow.  It's an NPR station?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  So he has to monotone it?  Yeah.  And just be like, interesting thing I saw on the news. 
[01:02:00]  Dave does try to tell a funny story every now and then, but for us who are used to hearing  Dave's real funny stories, you could just tell how completely subdued.  He seems like he's on a tranquilizer of some sort.  He slightly laughs instead of doing that real big laughing.  Real funny thing.  And it's not that crazy of a story at all compared to what we know he has.  Does he stick anything up his ass?  He's never done that on this show yet.  Wow.  I saw Dave the other day.  He was all...  On a bridge?  No. 
[01:02:30]  We were at a wake.  As you were driving by.  We were at a wake and everyone's sitting around.  It was like kind of a quiet time.  And Dave, and this is a fucking total shoot.  He was being serious.  He wasn't being strange.  And he just goes...  He wasn't trying to be funny.  He goes, you know, formaldehyde has only been with us since the 1860s.  And interestingly enough, it came along same time as the Civil War.  So it really was like the dot-com business of its day.  And we're all like, what the fuck are you talking about? 
[01:03:00]  But I bet most people weren't aware of that.  He'd just seen some Civil War documentary and just had this thing in his head as, I'm going  to try to appear as smart as you can when possible.  Can we rescue him somehow?  Or is it too late at this point?  No.  Dave is going to break through, in my fucking opinion.  Dave is going to hit something.  And I do think it's going to be visual.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  His videos are terrific.  His videos are so fucking funny.  But the thing that I told him years ago, instead of fucking having an anchor like Sam around 
[01:03:30]  his neck, is I really wanted him and his chick to do the show together.  Right.  And do that kind of he-said-she-said fucking show back and forth, because it's always been  a very, very funny concept to me.  Sam missed, a couple weeks ago, Sam misses a lot of time on that weekend show.  And they did the show together, and people were going fucking crazy for it.  Yeah, they enjoyed it.  It was the first special delivery that they really felt like Dave came through and was  himself.  But I also get positive feedback when it's me and Dave, and when it's just me. 
[01:04:00]  People love the show.  From your parents.  I know that.  Your parents are great people.  Well, they like it, and so do a lot of fans.  Your parents, you think right now, they're going, you really think they're going to do  this spin the wheel, make the deal thing?  Well, they won't.  It doesn't seem right.  They won't be listening except for the part when I spin the wheel.  Yeah.  If that goes down.  But you are confident that everyone else is going to bore of it, and you slide right  back in, right?  Everybody, I mean, if they're better than me, they can take it.  I mean, I'm not, I think. 
[01:04:30]  You're that sure that you're so much better than all the people you work with?  I don't know if any, if they are better than me, they can take it.  I'm not, like, if it is what it is, then it is what it is.  I'm not confident or uncomfortable.  How many times did you say is in that fucking sentence?  Is what it is.  It's like seven fucking times.  Yeah, four or five.  Yeah.  Have you learned anything from this hour, Sam?  Yeah, I shouldn't ask questions.  It was passive aggressive, wasn't it?  I mean, I hope he fucking brings you in here, gives you the fucking shot, and then you just  slap that on him. 
[01:05:00]  It's fucking odd.  That's all.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  I was being attacked a little bit.  Were you going for edgy there?  No.  I'd never go for edgy.  I'm not the least edgy person on the channel.  He told Morris to fuck himself, basically.  No, I said shut the fuck up.  Knowing that he can't choke you out.  Yeah.  That's edgy.  Is it?  Yes.  It seems kind of wimpy.  Why is it wimpy?  Because only a wimp would say this knowing that he can't get choked out when everybody 
[01:05:30]  listening knows that if I had the possibility of getting choked out, I wouldn't be saying  it.  That's a smart answer.  I don't know.  I think you're fucking wiry, and I think you'd have a tough time catching you.  I'm not even sure if you can.  I don't know if you can.  Seriously, I'm saying you move.  You're very fucking quick.  I guess so.  But, I mean, Mars has training.  I'm sure if it came down to fisticuffs, Mars would do all right.  Well, Mars is a little slow these days.  You think so?  Yeah, he's a little soft.  But do you notice something?  He's a little uncomfortable.  I like this.  Well, I'm not uncomfortable, but the vibe has changed. 
[01:06:00]  Yes, it has.  Yeah.  What, between the two of you?  Between me and Mars.  Exactly.  Who are you talking about?  You right now.  Yeah, I think Sam took it too far with Mars today.  No, no.  You think that's what did it?  With Ron.  Ron putting him in his place.  No, no.  The only time I got mad is when he slapped fucking Opie back with, what am I supposed to  do?  I feel it.  And I'm like, hey, easy.  If there's anything that happens between you two guys, I think it should be the old  Indian leg wrestling, which hasn't been done in many, many years.  I think it's time to bring that back.  Don't bring Ron into this for no reason. 
[01:06:30]  What the fuck is the Indian leg wrestling?  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  You should go do radio with this one.  Yeah.  Talk about garbage.  Garbage getting taken out.  Yeah, yeah.  You're more the, should I take the garbage out or not type of thing.  Right.  He's all like, oh, let's go to Mexico Gold Cup this Saturday night.  Easy.  Root with us for once.  USA.  Stop wearing the Sirius XM shirt around like.  Like that's going to help get you a raise.  It is what it is.  He's really flying the colors.  Yeah.  All right.  That's it.  Yeah.  Why are you flying the colors? 
[01:07:00]  Why am I flying the Sirius XM colors?  I know.  I mean.  Because it's a free shirt.  Yes, exactly.  What's wrong?  It's always the same thing.  I got to go get Fez.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Oh, yeah.  The flagpole thing.  Thanks, Ronnie.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  I'll be in Anthony.  I enjoy the hour with you.  Continue tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody. </pre>
